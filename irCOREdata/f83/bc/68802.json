Quantitative modeling suggests that graben boundary faults breaching the cryosphere provided pathways for water release from an underlying aquifer at a peak rate of \u223c107 m3 s\u22121. In the first event, the graben subsided by \u223c200 m, and water carrying a thin ice layer filled the graben, overflowing after \u223c2.5 hours, mainly at a low point on the north rim. This captured the water flux, eroding a gap in the north wall which, with an erosion rate of \u223c100 \u03bcm s\u22121 and a duration of \u223c1 month, was \u223c250 m deep by the end of water release. Erosion of the graben floor also took place, at \u223c20 \u03bcm s\u22121, lowering it by \u223c50 m. Subsequently, heat from the cooling dike melted cryosphere ice, causing a further \u223c150 m of subsidence on compaction.

Introduction\n[2] A series of graben systems, the Memnonia, Sirenum,\nIcaria, Thaumasia, and Claritas fossae (Figures 1 and 2) are\npresent in the region to the southwest, south, and southeast of\nArsiaMons, one of the three large shield volcanoes located on\nthe Tharsis rise, the most extensive volcanic province onMars\n[e.g., Zimbelman et al., 1992; Cattermole, 2001]. The Mem-\nnonia Fossae are the most northerly of these graben, and one\nof them, labeled Mangala Fossa [U.S. Geological Survey,\n2003] in Figure 1, is the source for the Mangala Valles\n(Figure 3), a major outflow channel system [Sharp andMalin,\n1975; Malin, 1976; Nummedal et al., 1976; Carr and Clow,\n1981; Tanaka and Chapman, 1990; Zimbelman et al., 1992;\nHead and Wilson, 2001; Ghatan et al., 2004, 2005; Head et\nal., 2004; Wilson and Head, 2004; Wilson et al., 2004a,\n2004b; Hanna and Phillips, 2005a; Leask, 2005] (also\nCraddock and Greeley [1994], as cited by Plescia [2003]).\nThe channel system is probably of Late Hesperian to Early\nAmazonian age [e.g., Tanaka and Chapman, 1990], and can\nbe traced to a\u0001650 m deep gap that breaches the north rim of\nthe graben at about 18.4\u0001S, 210.5\u0001E, and connects the interior\nof the graben to a broad valley leading toward the lowlands of\nAmazonis Planitia further to the north. We concur with most\nprevious authors in inferring that the great length and general\nmorphology of the channel system preclude formation by\nfluids other thanwater [e.g.,Hoffman, 2000], and that the only\nlogical interpretation of the morphology of Mangala Fossa is\nthat the graben filled with water which then overflowed,\neroding the gap [Zimbelman et al., 1992; Head and Wilson,\n2001; Ghatan et al., 2004; Head et al., 2004; Wilson and\nHead, 2004; Leask, 2005]. There is evidence that two water\nrelease events may have been needed to form the Mangala\nValles system in its present form [Chapman and Tanaka,\n1990; Tanaka and Chapman, 1990; Zimbelman et al., 1992;\nFuller and Head, 2002a, 2002b; Ghatan et al., 2004, 2005],\nand so the morphology of the graben in general, and partic-\nularly the gap in its north wall, may likewise represent the\naccumulated effects of two water flow events [Leask, 2005].\n[3] We explicitly assume that the source of the water was\nan aquifer system trapped beneath the impervious cryo-\nsphere, the outer few kilometers of the crust where the\ntemperature is less than the freezing point of water and pore\nspace is occupied by ice [Clifford, 1987, 1993; Carr, 1996].\nWilson and Head [2002] suggested that the Memnonia\nFossae and other fossae in this region were produced by\nthe intrusion of dikes propagating laterally from Arsia Mons\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 112, E02011, doi:10.1029\/2005JE002644, 2007\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Planetary Science Research Group, Environmental Science\nDepartment, Institute of Environmental and Natural Sciences, Lancaster\nUniversity, Lancaster, UK.\n2Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, USA.\nCopyright 2007 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/07\/2005JE002644$09.00\nE02011 1 of 16\n(Figure 1). The dike tops were trapped at shallow depth\nunderneath the surface by the combination of stresses due to\nthe excess pressure in the magma (acting to widen the dike)\nand regional loading and tectonic stresses (acting to close it)\n[Mastin and Pollard, 1988; Rubin, 1992; Head and Wilson,\n2001; Wilson and Head, 2001]. Topographic evidence that\nsome Martian graben are produced by dikes is growing\n[Schultz et al., 2004], and specific evidence for the presence\nof at least one dike beneath the eastern part of Mangala\nFossa is provided by the presence of what are interpreted by\nWilson and Head [2004] to be the deposits of a phreato-\nmagmatic eruption. The induced graben boundary faults,\ntogether with the underlying dike itself, would have pro-\nvided a system of fractures penetrating the cryosphere and\nfacilitating water release. In this paper we assume that water\nreached the surface along one or both of the graben faults.\nSoon after the first flood event ended, residual water in the\nparts of the fracture systems within the cryosphere would\nhave frozen. To allow the initiation of the second flood\nevent, either a new set of fractures must have formed or the\nold fractures must have been reactivated. We take this to\nimply that a second volcanic intrusion occurred to cause the\nsecond flood. The fact that phreatomagmatic volcanic\nactivity took place attests to the presence of ice and\/or\nwater at shallow depths at the time of at least one of the dike\nintrusions, and further evidence comes from the morphology\nof the impact crater located just south of Mangala Fossa at\n18.9\u0001S, 210.5\u0001E. Lobate, \u2018\u2018muddy\u2019\u2019 ejected material is\npresent around the crater on both the north and south sides\nof the graben, but there appears to be no ejecta present on\nthe graben floor (see Figure 3). The nature of the ejecta\nstrongly suggests that a cryosphere existed in this area at the\ntime of crater formation [Carr et al., 1977; Tanaka and\nChapman, 1990; Squyres et al., 1992], and the absence of\nFigure 1.

Inset is of Tharsis volcanic area.\nE02011 LEASK ET AL.: FORMATION OF MANGALA FOSSA\n2 of 16\nE02011\nejecta on the graben floor implies that the second flood\nevent must have occurred after the impact crater was formed\n[Tanaka and Chapman, 1990; Leask, 2005].\n[4] Water release triggered by interactions between\nvolcanic intrusions and the cryosphere has occurred in many\nplaces on Mars [e.g., Carr, 1979, 1987; Tanaka and\nChapman, 1990; Baker et al., 1991; Tanaka et al., 1991].\nWater release due to dike intrusion, as occurred at Mangala\nFossa, is inferred to have happened in Elysium, where the\nAthabasca Valles channel system is sourced from one of\nthe Cerberus Fossae graben [Burr et al., 2002a, 2002b;\nMcEwen et al., 2002; Manga, 2004; Mitchell et al., 2005].\nThe Athabasca and the Mangala source areas each have\ndistinctive characteristics. At Athabasca the width of the\nsource graben in the water release zone is similar to that\nelsewhere along its length, and there is evidence in the form\nof surface erosion for a few kilometers on either side of the\ngraben that a large water fountain formed due to the high\nspeed of the water rising through the cryosphere fracture\n[Head et al., 2003]. The implication is that water escaped\nfrom the graben mainly through the fountain, rather than\nsimply filling the graben and overflowing. There is no\nindication in the immediate vicinity of the water source of\neruption of magma from the underlying dike (though\neruptions did occur elsewhere along the graben [Berman\nand Hartmann, 2002; McEwen et al., 2002]). At Mangala,\nin contrast, the dike forming the Mangala Fossa graben\npenetrated far enough into the cryosphere along part of its\nlength near the eastern end to cause a phreatomagmatic\neruption [see Wilson and Head, 2004]. There is no indica-\nFigure 2.

We attempt to relate this to a\nproposed sequence of events that took place while two dike\nintrusions and associated flood events were in progress.\n2. Morphology of Mangala Fossa\n[6] Mangala Fossa has a continuously connected length\nof \u0001210 km (Figure 1). With the exception of the region\nnear the gap connecting it with the Mangala Valles, its width\nis typically \u00012 km, similar to the 1\u20132 km mean width of\nother members of the Memnonia Fossae graben group\n[Wilson and Head, 2002], and near its eastern end, where\na phreatomagmatic eruption took place [Wilson and Head,\n2004], its width averages \u00014.7 km (Figure 2). In the vicinity\nof the gap the structure is more complex, with the northern\nand southern en echelon segments being essentially in\ncontact (Figure 2). The width of the northern segment here\nis \u00014.5 km with a total width across the two of \u00019.9 km.\n[7] Figure 4 shows how the absolute levels (relative to the\nMars MOLA datum) of the north and south rims of Mangala\nFossa vary along strike (approximately WSW\u2013ENE) in the\nvicinity of the gap breaching the north wall of the graben.\nElevations were extracted from all standard MOLA profiles\nthat cross the area by taking data points as close as possible\nto the rim. It is clear that the south rim is generally higher\nthan the north rim, and that the gap is located at the lowest\npoint on the north rim. Thus the inference by all previous\nworkers that the gap was eroded by water spilling over the\nFigure 4. Topographical profiles, parallel to the strike of the Mangala Fossa graben, of the north and\nsouth rims of the graben, the gap in the north wall, the north and south plateaus, the tops of the proposed\ndikes, and parts of the graben floor. Elevations were extracted from all available MOLA profiles; see text\nfor details. Image shows locations of profiles. Vertical lines indicate longitudes 210 and 211\u0001E. At this\nlatitude, each degree of longitude represents \u000156 km.\nE02011 LEASK ET AL.: FORMATION OF MANGALA FOSSA\n4 of 16\nE02011\nlowest point on the rim when the graben became filled with\nwater seems entirely justified. There is other evidence that\nthe graben was filled with water at some time. In a few\nplaces, patches of ridged ground are present on the highland\nterrain immediately adjacent to the rim. One, located near\nthe gap, is shown at \u2018\u2018A\u2019\u2019 in Figure 3, and Head et al. [2004]\nshow similar patches on both sides of the graben near the\ngraben\u2019s eastern end. The texture of the surface in these\nareas led Head et al. [2004] to suggest that they are the\nresults of sheets of ice having been present. We infer that\nthis ice formed a thin layer on the surface of the lake of\nwater rising in the graben as it filled. Water initially over-\nflowed the rim of the graben in a few relatively low-lying\nplaces in addition to the location that was soon eroded to\nform the gap [Head et al., 2004]. In these other places ice\nwas rafted over the surrounding ground on a thin water\nlayer. As soon as the gap had eroded downward (and\npossibly sideways) to reach a cross-sectional area capable\nof carrying the water flux entering the graben from below,\nwater overflow in these other locations ceased. The ice rafts\nquickly became frozen to the local surface, and may then\nhave deformed slowly under gravity, while simultaneously\nsubliming into the atmosphere, to produce the surface\ndeposits and textures seen today. We attempt to quantify\nthese processes in section 6.\n[8] In the region to the east of the gap, Figure 4 shows\nthat the depth of the graben below its rim varies from 800 to\n1100 m with a mean of about 900 m [Leask, 2005]. In the\nimmediate vicinity of the gap and to the west, the depth is\n\u0001750 m. In terms of its depth the graben is thus signifi-\ncantly different from the other members of the Memnonia\nFossae graben group, which have depths of typically 100\u2013\n200 m, ranging up to 450 m [Wilson and Head, 2002]. If, as\nwe infer, the present graben is the result of two dike\nintrusion events, we might expect its depth to be double\nthe values for the other similar graben, that is, 200\u2013400 m,\nwith a possible maximum of 900 m, which is consistent\nwith the depths currently observed. However, we do not\nthink that the present depth of the graben can be entirely due\nto floor subsidence along boundary faults as a result of the\ntwo dike intrusions, for reasons discussed in section 3.\n[9] Figure 4 includes the east\u2013west profile of the gap\nbreaching the north wall of the graben. Unfortunately, no\nMOLA profiles cross the gap, and so we were forced to rely\non a photoclinometric (shape from shading) method applied\nto MOC images to deduce the local topography in the form\nof a series of approximately east\u2013west profiles locked to\nMOLA elevations on either side of the gap. This leads to a\nfew tens of meters uncertainty in absolute elevations within\nthe gap [Leask, 2005], but it is clear that in the vicinity of\nthe gap the present floor of the graben is \u0001100 m below the\nlevel of the floor of the gap.\n[10] A number of low, approximately aligned, elongate\nridges are present on the floor of the northern branch of the\nMangala Fossa graben (Figure 5). The location of these\nridges near the centerline of the northernmost graben seg-\nment, and their alignment with the local strike of that\nsegment, leads to the hypothesis that these may be outcrops\nof the top of the first dike segment, the one involved in the\nformation of this part of the graben, rather than small residual\nhorsts. In cross section these ridges appear triangular, imply-\ning that they are heavily eroded. If the average width of the\nthree lowest ridges, \u0001540 m, is reconstructed to vertical, it\nsuggests that the original dike thickness was \u0001270 m. This\nvalue fits well within the range (up to 600 to 700m) predicted\nbyWilson and Head [2002] for giant dikes onMars. The tops\nof the ridges lie at depths of \u0001600 to 800 m below the\nadjacent north wall of the graben, so that they extend 200 to\n300 m above the current graben floor (Figure 4). The greatest\nelevation of these ridges, i.e., the greatest proximity of the\ninferred dike tops to the preexisting surface, occurs at the\neastern end of the group, perhaps consistent with the fact that\nthis is the location of the phreatomagmatic eruption deposit\ndescribed by Wilson and Head [2004].\n3. Interpretation of Morphology\n[11] We base our interpretation of the events that have\nshaped Mangala Fossa on three key observations. First, the\npresent depth (\u0001750 m) and width (\u00014 km) of the graben in\nthe vicinity of the gap in the north wall are both more than\ndouble the values measured for other graben in the region.\nSecond, the \u0001100 m difference in height between the\npresent graben floor and the floor of the gap, together with\nthe colinearity of the graben floor-step contact and the\nnorthern graben boundary fault, can only reasonably be\nascribed to the subsidence of the graben floor after the\nsecond flood event ceased. Presumably this was due to\ndesiccation and compaction of the cryosphere by heat from\nthe second dike. Third, if, as we infer, the elongate struc-\ntures on the graben floor, which are at least 200 m high, are\noutcrops of the first dike, then the floor of the graben\nproduced by that first intrusion must have suffered signif-\nicant additional erosion by flowing water and\/or subsidence\nby cryosphere compaction; this could have occurred after\nthe first intrusion, after the second intrusion, or after each of\nthe two events.\n[12] How large might these various contributors to floor\nlowering have been? The overall average of a large number\nof depth measurements on other graben in the region is\n\u0001200 m [Wilson and Head, 2002], and we adopt this as our\nnominal estimate of the graben subsidence resulting from\neach of the two intrusion events at Mangala Fossa. We infer\nFigure 5. Mosaic of parts of THEMIS images (left)\nI04762002 and (right) V10329003 showing the highest\nproposed dike outcrops (D) on the floor of the Mangala\nFossa, near the source of the Mangala Valles. North is to the\ntop.\nE02011 LEASK ET AL.: FORMATION OF MANGALA FOSSA\n5 of 16\nE02011\nthe amount of cryosphere subsidence that took place after\neach intrusion as follows. Plausible values for the geother-\nmal gradient and mean surface temperature on Mars at the\ntime of the Mangala Fossa activity (Late Hesperian to Early\nAmazonian [Tanaka and Chapman, 1990]) are 15 K km\u00021\nand 210 K, respectively [Kieffer et al., 1977], and the\nmelting point of ice is 273 K. Thus the cryosphere thickness\nwould have been \u0001(273 \u0002 210)\/15 = 4.2 km. Models of the\nouter several kilometers of the Martian crust [Clifford, 1993;\nHanna and Phillips, 2003, 2005b] suggest that it may have\nan average pore space of \u000110% (Figure 6). This value\nwould be a function of the changing state of stress in the\ncrust caused by the emplacement of the dike that initiated\nthe graben [Hanna and Phillips, 2005b], but with cryo-\nsphere compressibilities in the range 10\u000210 to 10\u00029 Pa\u00021\n[Hanna and Phillips, 2005b], the change in porosity would\nbe minor (\u00010.1% to 1%). If we assume that all of the pore\nspace was filled with ice, and that after the ice melted and\nthe water was lost to the atmosphere the pore space\ncompacted to, say, 2\/3 of its original value, the vertical\nsubsidence would have been [(1\/3)\u0003 0.1\u0003 4200 =]\u0001140 m.\nAfter the crustal heat pulse from the first dike intrusion\nevent had been dispersed, a new cryosphere presumably\ndeveloped, as a result of upward percolation of water vapor\nfrom the underlying aquifer system as it recharged. The\ncompaction of pore space that had occurred as a result of the\nfirst event would have reduced the pore space to \u00016.6%. If\nany residual water were present in this pore space it would\nhave frozen after dissipation of the heat from the first dike,\nleading to a \u00019% increase in volume implied by the relative\ndensities of ice andwater [French, 1996], possibly expanding\nthe pore space to \u00017.2%. Thus the compaction that occurred\nafter the second intrusion might have been [(1\/3) \u0003 0.072 \u0003\n4200 =] \u0001101 m.\n[13] We round these two estimates of thermally induced\ncryosphere compaction to 150 m and 100 m, respectively.\nThus the amounts of graben floor lowering estimated so far\nare 200 m of vertical movement along faults and 150 m of\ncryosphere compaction in the first event and 200 m of\nvertical movement along faults and 100 m of cryosphere\ncompaction in the second event, giving a total of 650 m.\nThe current depth of the graben floor below its rim near the\ngap is 750 m, and so we ascribe the remaining 100 m\ndifference to there having been 50 m of floor erosion by the\nwater flowing through the graben during each flood event.\nThe floor level changes implied by this analysis are spec-\nified in Table 1; the first event is illustrated in Figure 7, and\nthe second is illustrated in Figure 8.\n[14] We now consider the implication of our inference\nthat part of the first intruded dike is exposed as the series of\n\u0001200 m high ridges on the present graben floor. It seems\ninevitable that the dike material, having cooled after the first\nevent and thus being rigidly embedded in the crust forming\nthe floor of the first graben, would have been carried down\nwith this crust as it subsided further during the second\nintrusion event. Thus the present level of exposure repre-\nsents the combined effects of floor lowering due to flowing\nwater erosion and cryosphere compaction during both\nevents. Our estimate of the total lowering by these processes\nduring the second event was given in the previous para-\ngraph as (100 + 50 =) \u0001150 m. This implies that after\nthe first event, the top of the dike was already exposed by\n\u000150 m. The total lowering by water erosion and cryosphere\ncompaction during the first event was estimated above as\n(150 + 50 =) \u0001200 m. Thus we infer that the top of the dike\nreached to within \u0001150 m of the surface during the first\nintrusion. The tops of dikes associated with graben forma-\ntion do not normally approach close to the surface [Mastin\nand Pollard, 1988; Rubin, 1992]. As part of a model of the\nformation of Martian graben by dike intrusion, Wilson and\nHead [2002] summarize work by Rubin [1992], who found\nthat for a set of dike-related graben in Iceland, the ratio\n(graben width\/depth of top of dike below surface) was\n\u00013.5. If the same ratio applies to dike-induced graben on\nMars (as it should, being independent of gravity and largely\ncontrolled by rock strength), then the typical graben widths\nin the least modified and least complicated parts of Mangala\nFossa, \u00012000 m, suggest that the depth to the dike top\nshould have been about 570 m. This is substantially greater\nthan our 150 m estimate. However, we note that there is\nvery strong evidence [Wilson and Head, 2004] that a\nphreatomagmatic eruption took place during one (presum-\nably therefore the first) of the intrusion events at the eastern\nend of Mangala Fossa, implying that the dike top was\nunusually shallow here, and this is consistent with the\nobservation that the absolute heights of the tops of the dike\noutcrop ridges increase toward the east (Figure 4). Using\nRubin\u2019s [1992] data source for dikes on Earth, Wilson and\nHead [2002] found that the ratio (dike width\/vertical sub-\nsidence of graben floor) was equal to \u00011.25. The \u0001400 m\nFigure 6. Porosity of outer 10 km of Martian cryosphere\nbased on models of Clifford [1993] and Hanna and Phillips\n[2003, 2005b].\nTable 1.

This appears to be consistent with the \u0001270 m\nwidth of the first dike deduced from the images (Figure 5)\nand implies that the second dike was \u0001230 m wide. These\nwidths lie well within the range deduced by Wilson and\nHead [2002] for intrusions in giant dike swarms on Mars,\nand are comparable to the measured widths of analogous\ngiant dikes on Earth [Ernst et al., 1995].\n[15] These estimates of the dike widths allow us to verify\na tacit assumption in the above treatment of graben floor\nlowering by cryosphere compaction after ice melting, which\nis that enough heat was released from each dike to melt the\nice in the whole of the cryosphere forming the floor of the\ngraben. We note that heat release will have been aided by\nthe en echelon nature of the dike emplacement which will\nhave placed a greater surface area of the dike in contact with\nthe cryosphere [Leask, 2005]. We calculate the total amount\nof sensible heat released by a dike 250 m thick cooling from\nan initial temperature of 1450 K (we assume that the dike\nwas mafic) to some equilibrium temperature which is also\ntaken to be the temperature of both the water and the rock\nFigure 7.

(b) The graben at Mangala is formed and fills with\nwater up to a depth of \u0001200 m, which spills over the graben rim. The main outflow is over the lowest part\nof the north rim. (c) This part of the north rim is eroded down by the outflow of water, forming a gap,\nwhich is \u00015 km in width. Lateral water flow within the graben erodes its floor by \u000150 m. (d) The amount\nof water released from the aquifer now decreases, and erosion of the gap and the floor stops, as the\namount of water released is now less than the amount of water escaping into the atmosphere. This ponded\nwater would likely be ice covered and would sublimate. (e) Heat from the cooling dike melts cryosphere\nice to form water which sublimates, causing floor subsidence of \u0001150 m. Eventually, any residual water\nin the fractured cryosphere freezes.\nE02011 LEASK ET AL.: FORMATION OF MANGALA FOSSA\n7 of 16\nE02011\ncomponents after cryosphere ice melting has occurred in the\nremaining 1750 m width of a zone 2 km wide. This zone is\nheated by a mixture of convection [Ogawa et al., 2003] in\nthe water component (assumed to be 10% of the volume on\nthe basis of the Hanna and Phillips [2003, 2005b] models)\nand conduction through the rock component (the remaining\n90% of the volume). This calculation is approximate\nbecause it neglects any latent heat of crystallization released\nby the magma and assumes that all of the available heat is\nconfined to a zone with the width of the graben floor,\nwhereas some of this heat may well be convected beyond\nthis zone. However, these two processes will tend to\ncompensate for one another. The material properties used\nare densities of 917 kg m\u00023 for ice, 1000 kg m\u00023 for water,\nand 3000 kg m\u00023 for both cryosphere rock and magma;\nspecific heats of 2000 J kg\u00021 K\u00021 for ice, 4190 J kg\u00021 K\u00021\nfor water, and 1000 J kg\u00021 K\u00021 for rock; and latent heats of\n3.33 \u0003 105 J kg\u00021 for ice melting and 2.5 \u0003 106 J kg\u00021 for\nwater evaporation. The initial mean temperature of the\ncryosphere is taken as 241.5 K, the average of the surface\ntemperature, 210 K, at the top and the ice melting point,\n273 K, at the base. The heat required to warm the cryosphere\nice and rock from this mean temperature to the point where\nice has finished melting everywhere but the temperature has\nnot risen above 273 K is then 8.92 \u0003 1014 J per meter along\nstrike of the dike. The vertical extent of the dike is 4050 m\n(recall that it intrudes to within 150 m of the surface of the\n4200 m thick cryosphere) and its width is \u0001250 m. To\nliberate the above amount of heat the dike magma would\nonly have to cool by \u0001294 K, so clearly there is more than\nenough heat to melt all of the ice. The additional amount of\nheat required to raise the temperature of the water fluid in the\nFigure 8.

(a) Emplacement of second dike from Arsia Mons\ncauses more fracturing of the surrounding aquifer and cryosphere. Mangala Fossa is widened and\ndeepened further. Thawing, subsidence, and collapse of the cryosphere above and around the hot magma\nin the dike begins. Water is released from the recharged pressurized aquifer below. (Arrow size represents\nwater quantity). (b) The graben fills with water up to an estimated depth of \u0001387 m (estimated height of\nthe step is shown). This leads to further erosion and deepening of the gap (by \u0001400 m) and of the graben\nfloor (by \u000150 m). Part of the top of the first dike is left exposed above the graben floor. (c) The amount of\nwater released from the aquifer now decreases, and erosion of the gap stops, as the amount of water\nreleased is now less than the amount of water escaping into the atmosphere. This ponded water would\nlikely be ice covered and would sublimate. (d) Heat from the cooling dike melts cryosphere ice to form\nwater which sublimates, causing floor subsidence of \u0001100 m. Eventually, any residual water in the\nfractured cryosphere freezes. The estimated present height of the step above the adjacent graben floor is\nbetween 45 m and 165 m. Weathering of part of the top of the first dike above the graben floor continues.\nE02011 LEASK ET AL.: FORMATION OF MANGALA FOSSA\n8 of 16\nE02011\ncryosphere above its boiling point, \u00012.4\u0003 106 J kg\u00021 [Kaye\nand Laby, 1966], is almost independent of the pressure\ndistribution with depth and corresponds to \u00011.69 \u0003 1015 J\nper meter along strike. The amount by which the magma\nwould have to cool to provide this additional heat is a further\n556 K, bringing the magma temperature down to (1450 \u0002\n294 \u0002 556 =) \u0001600 K. A more complicated recursive\ncalculation, which accounts for the heat required to raise\nthe temperatures of both the rock and water components of\nthe cryosphere above the ice melting point, shows that the\naverage maximum temperature that would have been\nreached is \u0001310 K, with the H2O being a vapor at shallow\ndepths and a liquid at greater depths. We stress the word\naverage here, because the highest temperatures would inev-\nitably be reached closest to the dike.\n4. Transport of Water to the Surface\n[16] In section 3 we estimated the cryosphere thickness at\nthe time of the formation of Mangala Fossa to be \u00014.2 km.\nModels of the compaction of the Martian crust [Clifford,\n1993; Hanna and Phillips, 2003, 2005b] (Figure 6) suggest\nthat the aquifer system extended from the base of the\ncryosphere to a depth of \u000110 km, below which porosity\ndecreased rapidly. This would make the aquifer thickness\n\u0001(10 \u0002 4.2 =) 5.8 km and the increase in temperature\nacross it \u0001(5.8 \u0003 15 =) 87 K. Thus the temperature at the\nbase of the aquifer would have been \u0001360 K (87\u0001C) and the\nmean temperature of the aquifer water, mixed by thermal\nconvection, would have been \u0001(273 + 360)\/2 = 316.5 K\n(43.5\u0001C). To estimate how much cooling might have\noccurred during transport of water to the surface we need\nto consider the motion of the water in the fracture.\n[17] The graben boundary fracture permitting water\nflow from the subcryosphere aquifer to the surface is treated\nas a planar, parallel-sided fissure having a vertical length H\nof 4.2 km (the thickness of the cryosphere calculated in\nsection 3), a horizontal length L (which is assumed to be\nequal to the 210 km length of the graben) and a widthW. It is\nassumed that water is driven up the fracture by the pressure\ndue to a head of water controlled by the regional topography.\nHowever, we note that an alternative pressure source could be\nthe change in stress state of the rocks in the region of the\ngraben due to the injection of the dike, as modeled by Hanna\nand Phillips [2005b]. The part ofMangala Fossa acting as the\nsource of Mangala Valles is a low point on the strike of the\ngraben (Figures 1 and 4) with higher ground to the west, east\nand south. If the pressure source is topographic, the control-\nling elevation difference is probably that to the east with a\nvalue of \u00012 km. The excess aquifer pressure implied by this\nis\u0001(2000 m\u0003 3.72 m s\u00022\u0003 1000 kgm\u00023 =) 7.4MPa and so\nthe pressure gradient driving water up the fracture, dP\/dz, is\n(7.4 \u0003 106 Pa)\/(4200 m =) 1760 Pa m\u00021. In their tectonic\nmodel, Hanna and Phillips [2005b] find an excess pressure\nof\u000110MPa, and this would imply a similar pressure gradient\nto that used here. The speed U of the water in the fracture,\nassuming its motion to be turbulent, is then given by\nU \u00bc W dP=dz\u00f0 \u00de= f r\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd \b1=2; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere f is a wall friction factor of order 10\u00022 and r is the\nwater density. For a series of values of W, Table 2 shows the\ncorresponding variations of U and the volume flux V equal\nto (UWL). Also shown is the corresponding Reynolds\nnumber, Re = (2 U r W)\/h, where h is the water viscosity,\nabout 6.3 \u0003 10\u00024 Pa s at the initial water temperature Tw =\n43.5\u0001C, and the transit time, t, required for a given batch of\nwater to flow up through the fracture. All the values of Re\nare much greater than 2000, thus verifying that the use of\nequation (1) for turbulent flow is justified.\n[18] The transit time t is important in that it controls the\namount of heat lost by the water. At a time t after the\nopening of the fracture, a wave of warming will have\npenetrated a distance l into the surrounding crust given\nby (k t)1\/2, where k is the thermal diffusivity of the\ncryosphere material, about 7 \u0003 10\u00027 m2 s\u00021. The\ncrustal temperature gradient controlling heat flow away\nfrom the fracture will then be dT\/dx = (Tw \u0002 Tc)\/l, where\nTc is the mean cryosphere temperature. The total heat flux\nout of the two faces of the fracture is (2 k H L dT\/dx), where\nk is the thermal conductivity of the cryosphere, about\n2 W m\u00021 K\u00021, and so the heat lost during the transit time\nt will be (2 t k H L dT\/dx). The mass of water losing this\nheat is equal to (r W L H s), where s is the specific heat of\nthe water, about 4180 J kg\u00021, and so the temperature decrease\nin the water will be dT = (2 t k H L dT\/dx)\/(rWLH s) = (2 t k\ndT\/dx)\/(r W s) = [2 t k (Tw \u0002 Tc)]\/[r W s (k t)1\/2]. This\nformula implies that the cooling is infinitely large at zero\ntime, so it is appropriate to find the average value of dT over\nthe travel time t, of a given batch of water through the\nfracture. This is given by dTa = (1\/t)\nR\ndT(t) dt, and for the\nfirst batch of water rising through the fracture, for which heat\nloss is at a maximum because there has not yet been any\nheating of the fracture walls, the integral is to be evaluated\nbetween t = 0 and t = t, and is found to be [4 t1\/2 k (Tw\u0002 Tc)]\/\n[rW s k1\/2]. Table 2 shows these values of dTa, together with\nthe actual water release temperatures, Tr, that they would\nproduce if, as estimated earlier, the initial water temperature\nin the aquifer were 43.5\u0001C. Clearly, cooling during transport\nof water to the surface would only be significant for fractures\nnarrower than\u00010.3 m, corresponding to a water flux of\u00015\u0003\n105 m3 s\u00021, and would be critical for fractures narrower than\n\u00010.1 m. Table 2 contains information for water fluxes up to a\nlittle more than 107 m3 s\u00021, because the maximum water flux\nthrough the Mangala Valles channel system was probably of\nthis order [Komar, 1979; Ghatan et al., 2004; Leask, 2005].\nThe fracture width required to deliver this flux is\u00012.3 m and\nthe water flow speed is \u000120 m s\u00021.\nTable 2.

At any\npoint along the graben the initial fracture would have\nformed as a result of the stresses initiated by the intrusion\nof the dike. The part of the graben acting as the source of the\nMangala Valles is about 2000 km from the magma source\nunder Arsia Mons. Models of the propagation of giant dikes\nfed directly from mantle plume heads on Mars [Wilson and\nHead, 2002] show that at this distance, the dike propagation\nspeed would have been of order 10 m s\u00021. The radius of\ncurvature of the dike tip would be about half the dike\nheight, say \u000130 km, and so the time for the dike width to\nhave become fully developed would have been\u0001(30,000 m)\/\n(10 m s\u00021) = \u00013000 s. The graben fracture precursors\nwould form quickly once the stresses due to the dike\ninjection were large enough to initiate them; to break\n4.2 km of cryosphere rock at about half of the speed of\nsound in rock, say 1 km s\u00021, takes \u00014 s. However, it is hard\nto estimate how long it would have taken before the stresses\nbecame large enough to start fractures propagating. We\narbitrarily assume that it took two thirds of the \u00013000 s\ndike width development time, so the remaining \u00011000 s\nwas the time taken by the graben floor to subside to a depth\nof 200 m, implying a subsidence speed of \u00010.2 m s\u00021.\nThe time for the water flow to develop in the aquifer was the\naquifer length, \u00011000 km [Leask, 2005] divided by\nthe speed of sound in water, \u00011.4 km s\u00021, i.e., \u0001700 s.\nThe time required for water to flow up the 4.2 km long\ncryosphere fracture, at a speed that Table 2 shows to be\ninitially \u000114 m s\u00021, was \u0001300 s. Thus water first started to\nemerge into the graben \u0001300 s after the graben boundary\nfaults formed and subsidence started, and the development\nof the water release rate was completed \u0001700 s later,\n\u00011000 s after subsidence started, which implies that the\ngraben floor finished its descent at about the time the full\nwater flow rate was reached.\n[20] The above analysis (and that which follows) is\npredicated on the assumption that the pressure gradient\ndriving water up the fracture did not change significantly\nover at least the time needed to fill the graben, which we\nshow in section 5 to be \u00012 hours. In a detailed model\ncoupling flow in an aquifer to discharge through a fracture\nallowing water to escape to the surface, Manga [2004] has\nshown that after a rapid rise to a maximum value, the\ndischarge should decrease in a way dictated by the perme-\nability of the aquifer. For the aquifer-fracture system at\nCerberus Fossae feeding the Athabasca Valles channel\nsystem, Manga [2004] found a discharge decay timescale\nof \u00010.5 hours if the permeability of the Martian aquifer was\ncomparable to that of basaltic lava flows on Earth,\u000110\u00029 m2.\nSince permeabilities of many terrestrial crustal rocks are\ncommonly very much smaller than those of relatively fresh\nlavas, this can be taken to imply that longer timescales\nwould not be expected on Mars. If the discharge decay\ntimescale were indeed \u00010.5 hours, all of our timescale\nestimates above would have to be increased by at least a\nfactor of ten if we retained the same peak discharge of\n\u0001107 m3 s\u00021; alternatively an order of magnitude larger\npeak discharge would have to be invoked.\n[21] This comparison underlines a major issue. The vari-\nous analyses implying that water discharges of \u0001107 m3 s\u00021\nare needed to form the Mangala Valles [Komar, 1979;\nGhatan et al., 2005; Leask, 2005] also imply that something\napproaching this level of discharge must be maintained for\nup to 2 months, not a few hours [Tanaka and Chapman,\n1990; Dohm et al., 2001a; Fuller and Head, 2002b; Leask,\n2005]. Analyses of other Martian outflow channel systems\nhave invoked even larger peak discharges, at least \u0001108\nand possibly \u0001109 m3 s\u00021 [Robinson and Tanaka, 1990;\nOri and Mosangini, 1998; Dohm et al., 2001b].Wilson et al.\n[2004a] pointed out that given our current understanding,\nthese rates could not be sustained for even a few minutes\nunless Martian aquifers were 2 orders of magnitude\nmore permeable than expected based on terrestrial compar-\nisons. This issue is very far from being resolved, but we\nfeel justified in proceeding on the assumption that a\ndischarge of \u0001107 m3 s\u00021 can be maintained for at least\nmany hours.\n5. Behavior of Water Filling the Graben\n[22] When the water flowing up either or both of the\ngraben bounding fractures reached the surface its velocity\nmust have carried it up to form a fountain from which it\ndescended again to feed a surface flow spreading away from\nthe fracture toward the center of the graben. Conservation of\nmass and energy then require that on average, the lateral\nspeed of the water, S, was equal to the speed at which it\nflowed up the fracture, and that the initial depth of the\nwater, Y, was equal to the fracture width.

This small width is consistent with the lack of any\nsurface features close to either rim of the graben that might\nprovide evidence of this kind of activity irrespective of\nwhether any significant water release had occurred before\nmuch of the 200 m of graben subsidence had taken place.\nThe values of S and Y in Table 3 show that the initial Froude\nnumber, Fi, of the water flowing away from the fracture,\nequal to S\/(g Y)1\/2, was close to \u00016.9 (independently of the\nwater volume flux), implying that the flow was supercritical\nand that a hydraulic jump would have very quickly taken\nplace to reduce the flow to a subcritical state. The factor f\nby which the depth would increase and the speed would\ndecrease was found from Fi using the standard relationship\n[e.g., Chow, 1959] f = 0.5 ((1 + 8 Fi\n2)1\/2 \u0002 1) to be \u00019.2,\nleading to a Froude number after the jump of \u00010.25.\n[23] Once released, the water must also have begun to\nevaporate. Using an annually averaged atmospheric model\nfor Mars to estimate the atmospheric pressure at the level of\nthe graben floor as it subsided we find an average value\nduring the first subsidence event of 602 Pa. This implies\nthat the vapor pressure of the water was greater than the\natmospheric pressure at all temperatures above the freezing\npoint. Under these conditions, the evaporation rate will have\ndepended only on the difference between the vapor pressure\nand the atmospheric pressure [Wallace and Sagan, 1979].\nThe mass of water vapor per unit area per second being lost\nfrom the water surface at any given temperature can then be\ncalculated using formulae given by Hecht [1990, p 297].\nDividing the mass flux per unit area by the density of the\nwater, \u00011000 kg m\u00023, gives the speed at which the\nspreading water layer gets shallower. Multiplying the mass\nflux per unit area by the latent heat of evaporation, close to\n2.4 \u0003 106 J kg\u00021 at all temperatures of interest here, gives\nthe heat flux per unit area leaving the flow, and dividing\nthe heat flux by the product of the density, specific heat\n(\u00014190 J kg\u00021 K\u00021) and depth of the water gives the rate at\nwhich the water temperature decreases with time. Dividing\nthe water depth by the rate of shallowing gives an estimate\nof the time before all of the water has evaporated, and\nmultiplying this time by the lateral water flow speed gives\nthe distance that water can travel before this occurs. This\ndistance is found to be much greater than the graben width\nfor all water release rates of interest here and is not a\nlimitation on the initial graben flooding. Finally, dividing\nthe initial release temperature in \u0001C by the cooling rate gives\nan estimate of the time before the water begins to freeze,\nand multiplying this time by the lateral water flow speed\ngives the distance, df, that it can travel before starting to\nfreeze. In detail, neither the rate of shallowing nor the rate\nof cooling are constant because the evaporation rate is\ntemperature-dependent, and so the depth and temperature\nchanges described above were evaluated numerically by\nrecalculating the rates as the temperature changed.\n[24] The results are given in Table 3. If only one bound-\nary fault releases water, ice formation is avoided for all\nwater release rates greater than \u00013 \u0003 106 m3 s\u00021, and if\nboth faults are active, ice formation is avoided if the flux up\neach fault is greater than \u00012 \u0003 106 m3 s\u00021, i.e., a total flux\nof >4 \u0003 106 m3 s\u00021. For all smaller discharge rates\nsome ice formation occurs. The maximum amount of ice that\nforms can be found by dividing the time available to form ice\nby the time needed to freeze all of the water once it has\nreached 0\u0001C. The time available for ice formation is equal to\nthe difference between the distance that has been traveled by\nthe water when the freezing point is reached and the total\ndistance that must be traveled (over most of the length of the\ngraben this is 2 km if only one fault releases water and 1 km\nif both do so) divided by the lateral water flow speed. The\ntime that would be needed to freeze all of the water is equal\nto the product of the water depth, water density and latent\nheat of fusion divided by the heat loss rate per unit surface\narea at the freezing point. The ratio of these two times gives\nthe fraction of the depth of the laterally spreading water that\nfreezes, and this fraction multiplied by the water depth\ngives the thickness of the resulting ice layer, assuming that\nall of the crystals float to the surface of the water. Table 3\nshows the maximum ice depths for the 1 km distance, X1,\nwhen both boundary faults release water, and for the 2 km\ndistance, X2, when only one does so. The corresponding\ntimes, tf1 and tf2, needed to complete the floor flooding are\nalso shown. It seems unlikely that more than \u000120 mm\nthickness of ice formed during the floor flooding process\nalong most of the graben. However, near the gap, where the\ngraben is wider, up to twice this thickness might be formed.\nWe note that all of the above calculations of ice production\nrate would change if the atmospheric pressure were signif-\nicantly different from the 602 Pa annual average value\nadopted. Lower pressures would not cause a great change,\nbecause the evaporation and heat loss rates would still be\ndominated by the vapor pressure of the water, but pressures\nmuch higher than \u0001610 Pa, the water vapor pressure at the\ntriple point, would cause a drastic reduction in evaporation\nand heat loss rates [Wallace and Sagan, 1979], probably\ncompletely precluding ice formation.\n[25] Taken together, the various constraints outlined so\nfar on the water release processes suggest that the earliest\nflows up the fracture(s) took place at discharge rates in\nexcess of \u00011.5 \u0003 105 m3 s\u00021, implying fracture widths of at\nleast 0.15 m, and grew steadily to a maximum value of\n\u0001107 m3 s\u00021 over a 700 s interval, which Table 3 shows is\ncomparable to the time taken to completely flood the graben\nfloor. The subsequent net filling rate, Y0, the amount by\nwhich the depth increase rate due to the inflow exceeded the\ndepth reduction rate due to continuing evaporation, is\nshown in Table 3 for each total water release rate. It becomes\npositive for inflow rates greater than \u00013 \u0003 106 m3 s\u00021. A\nperiod of\u0001100 seconds was needed for the water inflow rate\nto increase from \u00015 \u0003 105 m3 s\u00021 to 3 \u0003 106 m3 s\u00021, during\nwhich time the water motion on the floor of the graben would\nhave been complex as the initial surge settled into a more\nordered subcritical flow. If the water was not well mixed\nduring this period it is possible that at least another\u00015 mm of\nice formation took place. During the next \u0001250 s the water\nflux increased from 3 \u0003 106 m3 s\u00021 to 1 \u0003 107 m3 s\u00021.\nThereafter the water inflow rate was constant at\n\u00011\u0003 107 m3 s\u00021, though the water evaporation rate was still\na function of the surface water temperature.\n[26] There are two possible extremes for the behavior\nduring this period. If all of the water was well mixed, its\naverage temperature can be found by a simple heat-sharing\ncalculation, and the results of this are shown in Figure 9.\nFilling of the graben to its 200 m depth would have\noccurred \u00019055 s (\u00012.5 hours) after floor flooding was\nE02011 LEASK ET AL.: FORMATION OF MANGALA FOSSA\n11 of 16\nE02011\ncomplete and the water temperature would have been\n\u000116\u0001C. The other extreme possibility is that the water\nwas not well mixed but instead became stratified as its\ndepth increased. In that case the surface would have cooled\nrapidly and an ice layer would have developed all over it.\nThe deeper water would have quickly reached the temper-\nature at which water was being released from the fracture,\n\u000142\u0001C, and a thermal boundary layer would have separated\nthe ice from the warm water. The surface of the ice would\nhave cooled to the ambient temperature, \u0001210 K, and the\nthickness of the ice layer, Z, as a function of time, t, can be\npredicted by equating the heat flux through the ice layer to\nthe latent heat of freezing extracted from the water just\nbelow it, giving\nZ \u00bc 2CDT\u00f0 \u00de= L ri\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd \b1=2 t1=2; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere DT is the temperature difference across the layer,\n\u0001(273 \u0002 210 =) 63 K, C is the thermal conductivity of ice\naveraged over the 273\u2013210 K range, \u00012.5 W m\u00021 K\u00021, L\nis the latent heat of freezing, 3.33 \u0003 105 J kg\u00021, and ri is the\nice density, \u0001917 kg m\u00023. Because the surface of the ice is\nat the low ambient temperature, the rate of depth reduction\nof the ice layer by evaporation is very small [Wallace and\nSagan, 1979] and can be neglected, and so the graben filling\nrate is greater than in the case of the open water surface; the\ngraben fills to its 200 m depth in \u00018560 s and the ice\nthickness reaches \u000194 mm. This must be a maximum\nestimate, because it assumes that the ice layer is uniform\nand stable over all of the water surface. During the first\n\u00011000 s of the \u00018560 s, graben subsidence will still have\nbeen taking place, and so some local movement of water\nalong the axis of the graben would almost certainly have\ntaken place, disturbing the water surface.\n[27] So far in this section we have assumed that the width\nof the fracture and the corresponding water discharge rate\nwere controlled entirely by the pressure distribution in the\naquifer system. However, it is possible that the initial\nfracture was widened, at least in part, by the relatively\nwarmer water thermally eroding its cold walls. In that case it\ncould well have taken longer than we have calculated to\nreach the peak discharge rate, and so the graben would have\ntaken longer to fill; indeed, if the erosion timescale were\nmore than \u00011 hour, the graben would have become full\nbefore the peak discharge rate was reached. A second\nconsequence of a slower filling rate is that the likelihood\nof stratification of the water in the graben is increased,\nencouraging ice formation on the water surface, and the\nlonger filling time allows a greater ice thickness to develop,\nequation (2) showing that the thickness is proportional to\nthe square root of the time. As an extreme example of these\nissues, we consider a case where the fracture opens rapidly\nthrough the cryosphere, during dike emplacement, to a\nwidth of \u00010.3 m and is then widened to \u00012.3 m (consistent\nwith the final \u0001107 m3 s\u00021 water discharge rate) by a 1 m\nerosion of each of its walls as a thermal wave melts\ncryosphere ice. As discussed in section 4, the penetration\ndistance in time t is (k t)1\/2 and with k = \u00017 \u0003 10\u00027 m2 s\u00021,\nthe time required is \u00011.4 \u0003 106 s or \u000117 days. Published\nmodels of the formation of the Mangala Valles [Tanaka and\nChapman, 1990; Dohm et al., 2001a; Fuller and Head,\n2002b] suggest 1 to 2 months for the duration of the event,\nand \u000117 days is a very much larger fraction of this duration\nthan the \u00011 hour proposed earlier, but it cannot be excluded\nby the available evidence. In this extreme case, the ice\nthickness on the water overflowing the graben could have\nbeen as much as 1.2 m.\n6. Water Flow out of the Graben\n[28] The present average width of the gap in the north\nwall of the graben is \u00015.5 km, and it seems clear from the\ngeometry of the gap and the adjacent channels that the bulk\nof the water leaving the graben in the first flood event (and\nall of the water in the second event) utilized this escape\nroute. It seems reasonable to assume that the initial overflow\nbegan at the absolutely lowest point on the wall and spread\nboth eastward and westward as the overspilling water depth\nincreased until equilibrium was reached. The width of this\noverflow region is estimated to have been \u00017.0 km, based\non measuring the distance between the tops of the cliffs\ndefining the gap where they border the graben. The depth of\nwater in the center of the overspill can be estimated from the\nobservation that the downward slopes of the north graben\nwall toward the gap are 0.0165 from the west and 0.0108\nfrom the east. Taking the average of these slopes, say\n0.0136, and the 3500 m half width of the gap, the depth\nof water in the center of the overspill would have been\n(0.0136 \u0003 3500) = \u000147.6 m. The initial cross-sectional\nshape of the overspill was then an inverted isosceles triangle\n\u00017.0 km wide and \u000147.6 m deep; this corresponds to a\ncross-sectional area of \u0001167,000 m2 and an average depth\nof \u000123.8 m. The northward slope, a, of the ground at the\nlocation of the gap was estimated by examining the present-\nday slope of the ground on either side of the gap as sin\na = 0.058 by Ghatan et al. [2005]. In section 2 we\nnoted evidence for some limited water escape over the rim\nof the graben in a few other places, especially two locations\non the south side to the east of the gap which connect to the\nlow-lying interior of an old eroded crater [Head et al.,\n2004]. The total horizontal extent of these additional zones\nFigure 9. Variation with time since start of water release\nduring first release event of (left side) water depth in graben\nand (right side) average water temperature.\nE02011 LEASK ET AL.: FORMATION OF MANGALA FOSSA\n12 of 16\nE02011\nof water escape is \u00015 to 6 km. For modeling purposes we\nmake what we consider to be the reasonable assumption that\nthese locations had similar average depression depths and\nground slopes to those of the protogap, and hence infer that\nthe initial escape of water from the graben took place\nthrough the equivalent of a \u000112.5 km wide, \u000123.8 m deep\nchannel with a floor slope of 0.058.\n[29] This initial water flow would have taken place in\naccordance with the classical treatment of flow in open\nchannels which, using the Darcy-Weisbach equation in\npreference to the Manning formula [Wilson et al., 2004a],\ngives the mean flow speed, Uc, as\nUc \u00bc 8 g R sin a\u00f0 \u00de=fc\u00bd \b1=2; \u00f03\u00de\nwhere R is the hydraulic radius of the water channel,\nessentially equal to the \u000126 m depth of the flow, sin a is\n0.058, and fc is the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor. The\nvalue of the bed friction factor for this water depth, fc =\n\u00010.0335, is found by combining estimates of the typical\nsizes of rocks at the Viking and Pathfinder landing sites with\nempirical data on the effects of bed roughness on water flow\nin channels on Earth as described by Wilson et al. [2004a].\nThe resulting mean water speed is 36.4 m s\u00021, and\nmultiplying this by the mean water depth and the \u000112.5 km\ntotal width of the flowing water implies a maximum initial\ndischarge from the graben of \u00011.08 \u0003 107 m3 s\u00021. This\ndischarge is almost exactly equal to the 1 \u0003 107 m3 s\u00021 rate\nat which water was filling the graben in our standard\nscenario in which the discharge rate is reached rapidly after\nthe dike is emplaced, and implies that between them, the\nthree initial main overflow locations were almost certainly\nable to accommodate all of the water. They would certainly\nhave been able to do so if the increasing rate of water supply\nhad been controlled by thermal erosion of the fracture, as\ndescribed at the end of section 5, so that the peak discharge\nof 1 \u0003 107 m3 s\u00021 was not reached until long after the\ngraben was full.\n[30] As soon as water began to flow through the notches\nin the wall, downcutting of their floors by erosion would\nhave begun. It is clear from the present geometry that this\nwas minimal in the notches on the south rim, and that the\nnotch in the north wall where the present gap is located was\nalmost immediately dominant in draining water. The depth\nof the gap at the end of the first erosion event was found in\nsection 3 to have been \u0001250 m, and estimates of the\nduration of the main flood forming the Mangala Valles\nrange from \u000110 days to \u00012 months [Tanaka and Chapman,\n1990; Dohm et al., 2001a; Fuller and Head, 2002b; Leask,\n2005]. If a duration of, say, one month is assumed as the\ntime taken to erode the 250 m depth of the gap, the erosion\nrate implied is just less than 100 mm s\u00021. This rate is\ncomparable to that estimated (\u000150 m in 2 weeks = \u000140 \u0003\n10\u00026 m s\u00021) for the erosion of the channeled scabland by\nthe Missoula flood on Earth, the most commonly cited\nterrestrial analog to Martian outflow channels [Baker,\n1978]. Every meter of downcutting in the gap must have\ndrained a volume equal to that one meter multiplied by the\nhorizontal cross-sectional area of the graben which, given\nthe 210 km length and \u00012 km width, is \u0001420 km2. Thus the\nadditional discharge rate through the gap due to drainage of\nthe graben would have been (420 km2 \u0003 0.1 mm s\u00021) =\n\u00014.2 \u0003 104 m3 s\u00021. This value is only \u00010.4% of the\n1 \u0003 107 m3 s\u00021 inflow from the aquifer and so has little\nbearing on the history of the system.\n7. Erosion of the Graben Floor\n[31] The mean water flow speed along the floor of the\ngraben can be estimated as follows. The erosion rate of the\ngap was \u0001100 mm s\u00021, with a mean water flow speed of\n36.4 m s\u00021. By the time that erosion of its floor had\ndeepened the gap to 35.4 m it was just able to cope with\nthe 1 \u0003 107 m3 s\u00021 water flux, and so the water depth in the\ngraben at that time would have been equal to the 200 m\ndepth of the graben. Assume that half of the water flowed\ntoward the gap from each of the western and eastern ends of\nthe graben; then the flux in each half, 0.5 \u0003 107 m3 s\u00021,\nmust have been equal to the cross\u0002sectional area of the\ngraben, (200 \u0003 2000 =) 4 \u0003 105 m2, multiplied by the mean\nflow speed, making the mean flow speed (0.5 \u0003 107\/4 \u0003\n105 =) 12.5 m s\u00021. We assume that the material forming the\ngraben floor was similar to that forming the floor of the gap.\nWe further assume that the erosion rate of the graben floor\ncan be found by scaling the 100 mm s\u00021 estimate for the gap\ngiven in section 6. The scaling factor will be the ratio of the\nvelocities of water flowing across the floor and through the\ngap if the erosion process is momentum dominated, or will be\nthe square of the velocity ratio if erosion is energy dominated.\nThe implied erosion rates are then either 34.3 or 11.8 mm s\u00021,\nand in the estimated one month duration of the flood event\nthe amount of erosion will be either \u000189 or \u000131 m. These\nvalues are sufficiently close to the 50 m estimate derived in\nsection 3 from the morphology that we consider that\nestimate to be of at least the correct order of magnitude.\n[32] The surface area of the graben is \u0001210 km \u0003\n\u00012000 m = \u000141 \u0003 107 m2, and if \u000150 m of floor material\nwas eroded in each of the two flood events the total volume\nremoved is 42 km3. Ghatan et al. [2005] estimate that the\ntotal volume of crustal material eroded to form the Mangala\nValles system was \u000113,000 to 20,000 km3. Thus the\nvolume of graben floor material was a negligible fraction\nof the total transported by water in the channel system. The\nerosion of the graben floor is important in another respect,\nhowever; it caused much or all of the evidence for any\njuvenile magma having been erupted onto the graben floor\nas lava flows to be washed away.\n8. Postflood Subsidence of the Graben Floor\n[33] In section 3 we estimated that the widths of the dikes\ncausing graben subsidence atMangala Fossa were\u0001270m in\nthe first event and \u0001230 m in the second, and that the dikes\nmay have penetrated through the \u00014.2 km thick cryosphere\nto within \u0001150 m of the surface. Using the average dike\nwidth of 250 m, and taking the extent of penetration to\n4000 m, this implies that for each meter along strike,\n106 m3 of magma was intruded into the cryosphere. Assum-\ning a plausible mafic magma temperature of 1350 K, density\nof 2800 kg m\u00023, and specific heat of \u00011000 J kg\u00021 K\u00021, the\namount of heat released by this magma in cooling to the\nmelting point of ice was \u00013.0 \u0003 1015 J.\n[34] This may be compared with the amount of heat\nrequired to melt all of the ice present in the cryosphere\nE02011 LEASK ET AL.: FORMATION OF MANGALA FOSSA\n13 of 16\nE02011\nbeneath the graben floor. In section 3 we assumed that 10%\nby volume of the cryosphere was ice. The density of\nice is \u0001917 kg m\u00023 and its latent heat of fusion is\n\u00013.33 \u0003 105 J kg\u00021. Its average specific heat over the\n273 to 210 K temperature range that spans the cryosphere is\n\u00011900 J kg\u00021 K\u00021, with the average temperature rise to\nreach the melting point being \u000131.5 K. Thus, for each meter\nalong strike, to warm and melt all of the cryosphere ice in a\ntypical 2 km wide part of the graben requires \u00013.0 \u0003 1014 J,\nonly one tenth of the amount of heat available from the\ncooling dike. This implies that even allowing for the fact\nthat the transfer of heat from the cooling dike to the more\ndistal parts of the ice must have been relatively inefficient,\ndespite the assistance of a hydrothermal convection system\n[Gulick, 1998; Ogawa et al., 2003], we see no problem with\njustifying the proposal in section 3 that late stage graben\nfloor subsidence amounts of up to 150 m were caused by\nthis mechanism.\n[35] The volume of water produced by one dike extend-\ning for the full \u0001210 km length of Mangala Fossa and\nmelting all the ice in a 2 km wide zone of the 4.2-km-thick\ncryosphere would have been \u0001176 km3. This is a negligible\nfraction of the \u000120,000 to 30,000 km3 estimate by Ghatan\net al. [2005] of the minimum total volume of water that was\nrequired to erode the Mangala Valles system. Also, the rate\nat which heat would have been released from the dike\nwould have been limited by the conduction of heat from\nthe still molten dike interior through the growing solidified\nlayer to each subvertical interface with the host rocks, the\ntimescale for which would have been of order (h2\/k), where\nh is the half width of the dike and k is the thermal\ndiffusivity of silicate rock. Using k = 7 \u0003 10\u00027 m2 s\u00021\nand the average value of the dike width estimates from\nsection 3, h = \u0001125 m, the timescale for cooling is\n\u00011000 years. This value assumes that the dike remains\nimpermeable to the water being produced, but extensive\nfracturing would be needed to reduce the timescale signif-\nicantly. We conclude that no significant amount of water\nfrom the melting of ice in the cryosphere contributed to the\nflooding of the Mangala Valles.\n9. Discussion\n[36] Sections 4 to 8 dealt mainly with the processes that\ntook place during the first dike intrusion and water flood\nevent at Mangala Fossa. Section 3 presented evidence for\ntwo such events, with Table 1 showing that the main\ndifference inferred from the morphology was that at the\nend of the second event there was a smaller amount of\ngraben floor subsidence due to melting of cryosphere ice by\nheat from the cooling dike. The present geometry of the gap\nsuggests that by the end of the first event, when the gap had\nbeen eroded to a depth of \u0001250 m, its width at the level of\nits floor was \u00015.5 km. Assuming a similar water supply rate\nin the second event to that in the first, overflow of water\nthrough the gap would have taken place at a fully developed\nwater flux of \u00011 \u0003 107 m3 s\u00021. If the floor of the gap still\nhad the same slope as in the first event, \u00010.058, the solution\nof equation (3) gives the water depth as \u000137.3 m and the\nmean flow speed as 48.7 m s\u00021. Thus, during the second\nperiod of flooding of the graben, the water level would have\nhad to rise from the new floor level after graben subsidence,\n\u0001600 m below the original graben rim, to the level of the\nfloor of the gap in the north wall at the end of the first flood\nevent, estimated to have been \u0001250 m below the original\ngraben rim, and then a further 37.3 m to reach an equilib-\nrium between inflow and outflow, making a total water\ndepth of \u0001387 m.\n[37] If the pattern of development of the water supply rate\nup the graben boundary fault was similar in the two flood\nevents, the time taken to reach this equilibrium can be\nfound, using the same methods that were applied to the first\nevent in section 5, to be \u00014.9 hours in the well-mixed case.\nIn the case where the water becomes stratified as it deepens,\nthe filling time would have been \u00014.6 hours and the\nthickness of the ice layer on the water surface would have\nbeen \u0001130 mm. The present level of the floor of the gap is\n\u0001650 m below the original graben rim; if, as estimated in\nsection 3, the level of the floor of the gap was \u0001250 m\nbelow the rim at the end of the first event, an additional\n400 m of erosion occurred during the second event. At a\nsimilar erosion rate to the \u0001100 mm s\u00021 estimated for the\nfirst event, this would have required \u000145 days.\n[38] This \u0001387 m maximum water depth in the graben\nduring the second flood event is approaching a factor of 2\ngreater than the maximum water depth in the first event.\nThis depth of water would have exerted a significant\npressure, \u00011.4 MPa, at its base. One consequence of\nthe presence of this head of water is to reduce, by \u00018%,\nthe pressure gradient used in section 3 to drive water to the\nsurface, thus decreasing the maximum flow rate and in-\ncreasing the filling time by a similar amount for the same\nassumed fracture geometry. A second consequence is some\nalteration of the stresses and stress gradients in, especially,\nthe north wall of the graben, especially near the gap where\nits horizontal north\u2013south thickness is at a minimum.\nHowever, there is no indication from the morphology that\nwholesale collapse of the wall took place; rather, the\nformation of the walls and floor of the gap appears to have\nbeen the result of a relatively steady water erosion process.\n10. Conclusions\n[39] 1. Previous work has suggested on morphological\ngrounds that two water release events occurred at Mangala\nFossa to form the Mangala Valles outflow channel system.\nWe argue that these two events were each the consequence\nof a dike-induced graben formation episode at Mangala\nFossa, the evidence being the inferred presence of exposed\noutcrops of the first dike on the floor of the graben, and the\nneed for a second dike to induce the changes that exposed\nparts of the first dike. A second argument for the presence\nof a second dike is the unusual width of the graben near the\nsource of the channel system. By comparison with other\ngraben in the Memnonia Fossae group we infer that the\namount of graben subsidence in each event was \u0001200 m.\n[40] 2. Previous estimates of a peak water discharge rate\nof \u0001107 m3 s\u00021 can be understood in terms of water flow\nfrom an underlying aquifer up one or both graben boundary\nfaults. Typical conditions would have involved a maximum\nwater flow speed of \u000120 m s\u00021 up a \u00012.3 m wide fracture.\nDepending on the extent of vertical mixing of the water, this\nwould have filled the graben to its rim in \u00012.4 to 2.5 hours\nin the first event and in 4.6 to 4.9 hours in the second event.\nE02011 LEASK ET AL.: FORMATION OF MANGALA FOSSA\n14 of 16\nE02011\n[41] 3. Initial overflow of the graben, as it filled during\nthe first event, took place from the three locally lowest\npoints on its rim, but rapidly became concentrated into a\n\u00017 km wide and up to \u000148 m deep zone on the north rim\nthat was subsequently eroded into the present gap. The\nsurface in the vicinity of the two short-lived overflow points\non the south rim of the graben shows textures possibly\nrelated to the presence of an ice layer on the overflowing\nwater. If ice was present, then the atmospheric pressure at the\ntime of the first event must have been no more than\u0001610 Pa.\n[42] 4. The \u0001650 m depth of the gap, combined with\nprevious estimates of a total duration of water flow of\n\u00012 months, implies an erosion rate of the floor of the gap\nof \u0001100 mm s\u00021. Scaling this erosion rate to the water flow\nregime within the graben implies that the floor was eroded\nat an average rate of \u000120 mm s\u00021, resulting in \u000150 m of\nfloor erosion during each flood event.\n[43] 5. The difference of \u0001100 m in height between the\nfloor of the gap and the present graben floor implies that the\ngraben floor subsided by this amount after the second flood\nevent ceased. The most plausible explanation is desiccation\nand compaction of the cryosphere by heat from the second\ndike. It is logical to assume that similar subsidence also took\nplace at the end of the first flood event.\n[44] 6. Because dike heating during the first event would\nhave compacted the shallowest part of the cryosphere,\nwhere pore space was greatest, less ice would have been\npresent in the cryosphere at the start of the second event,\nand so the second event would have involved less subsi-\ndence than the first. An estimate of \u0001150 m subsidence in\nthe first event is consistent with this argument and is also\nconsistent with the present \u0001750 m total depth of the graben\nin the immediate vicinity of the gap in its north wall. The\nfloor depth changes as Mangala Fossa evolved are summa-\nrized in Table 1.\n[45] 7. The region around the gap in the north wall of\nMangala Fossa would be an ideal location for investigation\nwith the MARSIS radar system on the Mars Express\nspacecraft, since it offers the possibility of detection of\none or more shallow dikes cutting the regional cryosphere,\ntogether with possible local anomalies in the vertical distri-\nbution of H2O in the cryosphere. It may also be possible to\ndetect vertical displacements of horizontal cryosphere struc-\nture along the graben boundary faults.\nNotation\nC average thermal conductivity of ice, 273\u2013210 K,\nW m\u00021 K\u00021.\nFi value of the Froude number prior to a hydraulic\njump, dimensionless.\nH vertical length of fracture, m.\nHf height of water fountain of water exiting fracture,\nm.\nL horizontal length of fracture, m.\nR hydraulic radius of water flow, \n water depth, m.\nRe Reynolds number of water flow in fracture,\ndimensionless.\nS speed of water flowing across graben floor, m s\u00021.\nTc mean cryosphere temperature, K.\nTr temperature of water exiting fracture, K.\nTw temperature of water in aquifer, K.\nU rise speed of water in fracture, m s\u00021.\nUc mean water flow speed through overflow channels,\nm s\u00021.\nV volume flux of water rising through fracture,\nm3 s\u00021.\nW width of fracture, m.\nWf width of fountain of water exiting fracture, m.\nX1 maximum thickness of ice on water flowing 1 km, m.\nX2 maximum thickness of ice on water flowing 2 km, m.\nY initial depth of water flowing across graben floor, m.\nY0 net filling rate of graben, m s\u00021.\nZ thickness of ice layer onwater rising to fill graben, m.\ndP\/dz pressure gradient driving water up fracture, Pa m\u00021.\ndT\/dx temperature gradient near fracture, K m\u00021.\nf wall friction factor, dimensionless.\nfc Darcy-Weisbach friction factor for water flow,\ndimensionless.\nh half width of dike, m.\nk thermal conductivity of cryosphere, W m\u00021 K\u00021.\nDT temperature difference across ice layer, K.\nL latent heat of freezing of ice, J kg\u00021.\na slope of ground near gap in north wall of graben,\ndegrees.\ndTa cooling of water rising through fracture, K.\nh viscosity of water, Pa s.\nk thermal diffusivity of cryosphere material, m2 s\u00021.\nl distance penetrated by heating wave, m.\nf water depth increase factor through hydraulic jump,\ndimensionless.\nr density of water, kg m\u00023.\nri density of ice, kg m\n\u00023.\nt transit time of water through fracture, s.\ntf1 time to complete flooding of 1 km wide graben\nfloor, s.\ntf2 time to complete flooding of 2 km wide graben\nfloor, s.\n[46] Acknowledgments.
