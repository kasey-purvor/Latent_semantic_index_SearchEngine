The importance of cruise altitude, size of the emission perturbation and geographical distribution of emissions is systematically analyzed using two global chemistry transport models and an off-line radiative transfer model. NO x emissions from a contemporary aircraft inventory have been used to assess the impact of global air traffic on ozone and methane. In further experiments the NO x emissions are perturbed, in turn, in 16 cruise altitude bands between 5 and 15 km altitude. In the p-TOMCAT model we diagnose an annual mean ozone increase of up to 6 ppbv and a decrease in the methane lifetime of 3% due to global air traffic in 2002. Associated radiative forcings of 30 mWm\u22122 for ozone and \u221219 mWm\u22122 for methane are diagnosed; a simple method is used to estimate the forcing due to the methane-induced ozone change and this yields an additional \u221211 mWm\u22122. Results show that up to the tropopause, ozone production efficiency and resulting impacts increase per emitted mass of NO x with the altitude of the perturbation. Between 11 and 15 km we find that the geographical location of the NO x emissions plays a crucial role in the potential O3 impact and lifetime change of CH4. We show that changes in flight routing in this altitude range can have significant consequences for O3 and CH4 concentrations. Overall, we demonstrate a linear relationship in the atmospheric response to small emission changes which can be used to predict the importance of perturbations about the reference aircraft emissions profile, provided the geographical distribution of the emissions is not altered significantly","downloadUrl":"https:\/\/core.ac.uk\/download\/pdf\/69206.pdf","fullTextIdentifier":"http:\/\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\/27966\/1\/2007JD009140.pdf","pdfHashValue":"849c2e4c09f6b63bf9166f2aa87df9c417ef01d3","publisher":null,"rawRecordXml":"<record><header><identifier>\n    \n    \n      oai:eprints.lancs.ac.uk:27966<\/identifier><datestamp>\n      2018-01-24T02:51:34Z<\/datestamp><setSpec>\n      7374617475733D707562<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n      7375626A656374733D47:4745<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n      74797065733D61727469636C65<\/setSpec><\/header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:oai_dc=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/\" xmlns:dc=\"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/ http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc.xsd\" ><dc:title>\n    \n      \n        Impact of perturbations to nitrogen oxide emissions from global aviation.<\/dc:title><dc:creator>\n        K\u00f6hler, Marcus O.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\n        R\u00e4del, Gaby<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\n        Dessens, Olivier<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\n        Shine, Keith P.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\n        Rogers, Helen L.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\n        Wild, Oliver<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\n        Pyle, John A.<\/dc:creator><dc:subject>\n        GE Environmental Sciences<\/dc:subject><dc:description>\n        The atmospheric response to perturbations in NO x emissions from global air traffic is investigated by performing a coherent set of sensitivity experiments.

Associated radiative forcings of 30 mWm\u22122 for ozone and \u221219 mWm\u22122 for methane are diagnosed; a simple method is used to estimate the forcing due to the methane-induced ozone change and this yields an additional \u221211 mWm\u22122. Results show that up to the tropopause, ozone production efficiency and resulting impacts increase per emitted mass of NO x with the altitude of the perturbation. Between 11 and 15 km we find that the geographical location of the NO x emissions plays a crucial role in the potential O3 impact and lifetime change of CH4. We show that changes in flight routing in this altitude range can have significant consequences for O3 and CH4 concentrations. Overall, we demonstrate a linear relationship in the atmospheric response to small emission changes which can be used to predict the importance of perturbations about the reference aircraft emissions profile, provided the geographical distribution of the emissions is not altered significantly.<\/dc:description><dc:date>\n        2008-06-10<\/dc:date><dc:type>\n        Journal Article<\/dc:type><dc:type>\n        PeerReviewed<\/dc:type><dc:format>\n        application\/pdf<\/dc:format><dc:identifier>\n        http:\/\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\/27966\/1\/2007JD009140.pdf<\/dc:identifier><dc:relation>\n        http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1029\/2007JD009140<\/dc:relation><dc:identifier>\n        K\u00f6hler, Marcus O. and R\u00e4del, Gaby and Dessens, Olivier and Shine, Keith P. and Rogers, Helen L. and Wild, Oliver and Pyle, John A.

Res., 113, D11305, doi:10.1029\/2007JD009140.\n1. Introduction\n[2] Nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2) play an impor-\ntant role in the chemical formation of ozone (O3) in the\ntroposphere and lower stratosphere [Crutzen, 1973; Liu et\nal., 1987]. Enhanced NOx can increase O3 concentrations\nresulting in a positive radiative forcing. The resulting\nenhancement of the oxidizing capacity of the troposphere\nreduces the lifetime of methane (CH4) which leads to a\nnegative forcing [Fuglestvedt et al., 1999; Wild et al., 2001;\nStevenson et al., 2004] and the reduced methane itself also\nleads to a reduction in ozone. Therefore emissions of\nnitrogen oxides act as an indirect forcing agent by altering\nthe abundance of chemically active greenhouse gases.\nGlobal air traffic represents a major source of NOx through-\nout the free troposphere [e.g., Brasseur et al., 1998; IPCC,\n1999; Sausen et al., 2005], together with other sources from\nlightning [e.g., Chameides et al., 1977], downward trans-\nport from the stratosphere [e.g., Lamarque et al., 1996] and\nconvective uplift from polluted regions close to the surface\n[e.g., Brunner et al., 1998]. Quantification of the impact of\naircraft NOx however remains difficult as the chemical\nformation of ozone is strongly dependent on the ambient\nbackground concentrations of the oxides of both hydrogen\nand nitrogen and of volatile organic compounds [Jaegle\u00b4 et\nal., 1998a; IPCC, 1999].\n[3] Several recent studies have investigated the possibil-\nity of minimizing the impact of aircraft NOx emissions on\nozone and methane through changes in routing or cruise\naltitude [Grewe et al., 2002a; Isaksen, 2003]. Their findings\nhave shown that such operational changes have an impact\nboth on atmospheric composition and related radiative\nforcings [Grewe et al., 2002a; Gauss et al., 2006a; Stordal\net al., 2006]. These studies investigated the sensitivity of\nthe atmospheric impact to a shift in the flight altitude of the\nglobal aircraft fleet. Although it is possible to determine the\nnet impacts the identification and quantification of individ-\nual processes remains difficult.\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 113, D11305, doi:10.1029\/2007JD009140, 2008\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Centre for Atmospheric Science, Department of Chemistry, University\nof Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.\n2Department of Meteorology, University of Reading, Reading, UK.\n3Institute for Aviation and the Environment, University of Cambridge,\nCambridge, UK.\n4Now at the Department of Environmental Science, Lancaster\nUniversity, Lancaster, UK.\n5NCAS-Climate, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.\nCopyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/08\/2007JD009140$09.00\nD11305 1 of 15\n[4] In this study we have adopted a more systematic\napproach by investigating the atmosphere\u2019s sensitivity to\nperturbations of a range of key emission parameters. The\nchange in global greenhouse gas concentrations and the\nassociated radiative impacts following the NOx emission\nperturbations have been considered using two 3-dimensional\nglobal chemistry transport models and an off-line radiation\ncode. This study also includes an explicit calculation of the\nlonger term impact of NOx emission perturbations on meth-\nane. Aircraft NOx emissions are increased by 5%, 10% and\n20% within a selection of designated cruise altitude bands.\nSuch small increases in emissions could represent the intro-\nduction of a new aircraft to the existing commercial fleet or\nchanges in air traffic demand. Above 11 km altitude, where\nthe geographical coverage of emissions changes rapidly with\naltitude, we also investigate the impact of a varying geo-\ngraphical distribution of the emissions by perturbing the\ngeographical coverage at a given cruise altitude band while\nmaintaining the total emitted amount. A more quantitative\naccount of the methodology used is described in section 3.\nThis methodology allows us to investigate the atmospheric\nsensitivity to aircraft NOx as a function of location, altitude,\nand magnitude of the emission perturbation. These emission\nperturbations form a coherent set of sensitivity experiments\nfrom which we aim to establish a relationship between the\nchange in the emission parameter and the response of the\natmosphere. A related study [Ra\u00a8del and Shine, 2008] inves-\ntigates, in a similar manner, the impact of changes in flight\naltitude on contrail radiative forcing.\n[5] The following section describes the chemistry trans-\nport models used and the methodology adopted to calculate\nthe indirect NOx effects on methane. Section 3 outlines the\nexperiments. The effects of aircraft emissions on ozone and\nmethane and the sensitivity to cruise altitude are discussed\nin sections 4 and 5. Sensitivity to the size of the perturbation\nand the importance of the geographical distribution of\nemissions are investigated in sections 6 and 7. A description\nof the radiation code and the radiative impacts of the\ncomposition changes are presented in section 8. We con-\nclude with a discussion of our findings.\n2. Model Configuration\n[6] The 3D chemistry transport model p-TOMCAT\n[O\u2019Connor et al., 2005; Cook et al., 2007] is an updated\nand parallelized version of the earlier TOMCAT model\n[Law et al., 1998, 2000; Savage et al., 2004]. It includes\na gas-phase methane-oxidation scheme with simplified\nNMHC treatment (ethane, propane) on 35 hybrid-pressure\nlevels from the surface to 10 hPa, with a vertical resolution\nof approximately 700 m in the upper troposphere and lower\nstratosphere (UTLS) region. In order to achieve the number\nof integrations required for this study we have chosen a\nhorizontal grid resolution of 5.6 \u0002 5.6 degrees which\nadequately represents the global distribution of aircraft\nemissions. At the upper boundary O3, CH4 and NOy are\nprescribed with climatological values from the Cambridge\n2D-Model [Law and Pyle, 1993]. Photolysis rates are\ncalculated off-line with the Cambridge 2D model. A recent\nvalidation of TOMCAT with airborne observations together\nwith an intercomparison of its results with those from other\nmodels is published by Brunner et al. [2003, 2005]. Therein\nit is shown that the model is capable of reproducing\ncontemporary atmospheric background conditions and the\nresults are within the range calculated by other atmospheric\nmodels. For the experiments in this study the model was\nforced by ECMWF operational analyses for 2001 and 2002.\nThe year 2001 served as a spin-up period and only the\nresults from 2002 are shown in this study.\n[7] The p-TOMCAT model does not consider heteroge-\nneous and halogen chemistry in the stratosphere and its\nupper boundary is located at 10 hPa (32 km). This allows\nonly a limited representation of stratospheric processes.\nFor this purpose a subset of the experiments was also\ncarried out using the SLIMCAT chemistry transport model\n[Chipperfield, 1999] to investigate the impact of aircraft\nemissions specifically in the stratosphere. The SLIMCAT\nmodel is forced by UKMO analyses and incorporates a\nstratospheric chemistry scheme on 18 isentropic levels\nbetween 335 K and 2700 K (10\u201355 km). A spin-up integra-\ntion of 6 perpetual years of 2001 meteorology prior to one\nyear of 2002 meteorology ensures the appropriate represen-\ntation of transport timescales within the stratosphere.\n[8] The lifetime of methane with respect to chemical\nremoval by hydroxyl radicals (OH) in this version of p-\nTOMCAT is determined as 13.5 years when aircraft NOx\nemissions are included. This value is at the upper limit of\nthe model range presented in IPCC [2001] and \u000340% above\nthe mean value of 9.6 years. In our sensitivity studies we\nfocus however on the fractional lifetime change caused by\nperturbations to NOx emissions and therefore results are\nrelatively insensitive to the base lifetime. The inclusion of\nstratospheric and soil sinks which are assumed to be 40 Tg\na\u00011 and 30 Tg a\u00011, respectively [IPCC, 2001], results in a\nglobal CH4 lifetime of 11.3 years. The inclusion of aircraft\nNOx emissions to a model atmosphere without aircraft\nemissions leads to the increased formation of OH which\nincreases the oxidizing capacity of the troposphere and\nreduces the lifetime of CH4. This in turn enhances the\ninitial OH perturbation through a positive feedback\n[Prather, 1994]. The steady state CH4 concentration can\nbe calculated, using the method shown by Fuglestvedt et al.\n[1999], without the need for integrating the model over\nseveral decades; CH4 concentrations are fixed in the model\nand we diagnose the initial change in OH due to altered NOx\nemissions. Steady state methane perturbations are then\nderived by applying a model-dependent feedback factor to\nthe initial CH4 lifetime change with respect to OH. This\nfeedback factor (the ratio of adjustment time to global\nlifetime, including stratospheric and soil sinks) is 1.3 for\np-TOMCAT and was calculated from two reference experi-\nments, the first of which had unaltered CH4 levels and the\nsecond had CH4 levels globally increased by 5%. The\nadjustment time of CH4 in p-TOMCAT is 30% longer than\nits global lifetime, at the lower limit of model ranges by\nIPCC [2001]. In this study a global annual mean 3-dimen-\nsional CH4 distribution obtained from an earlier long-term\nintegration [Warwick et al., 2002] was used as a fixed\nboundary condition (global burden 4760 Tg CH4).\n3. Experiment Description\n[9] Experiments were designed to investigate the atmo-\nspheric response to perturbations in several key emission\nD11305 KO\u00a8HLER ET AL.: IMPACT OF PERTURBATIONS TO NITROGEN OXIDE EMISSIONS\n2 of 15\nD11305\nparameters: cruise altitude, size of the perturbation and the\ngeographical distribution of emissions. They form a coher-\nent set of sensitivity studies covering the complete altitude\nrange where aircraft fly during cruise [IPCC, 1999] and\nwhere globally more than 60% of NOx emissions from\naircraft are released. The perturbations were applied to a\nreference emission distribution which was obtained from a\nglobal aircraft emission inventory. The aircraft NO2 emis-\nsion data for 2002 from the European AERO2k Project\n[Eyers et al., 2004] was used here as the reference with an\nannual total fuel usage of 176 Tg resulting in emissions of\n0.68 Tg N. Figure 1a shows the zonally averaged annual\ntotal aircraft emissions from the AERO2k global inventory.\nThe altitude range between 5 km and 15 km (16.5\u201348.5 kft),\nextending over the free troposphere and lower stratosphere,\nwas divided into 16 equal cruise altitude bands of 610 m\n(2000 ft) thickness, henceforth referred to as \u2018\u2018perturbation\nlevels\u2019\u2019 (Table 1). During each experiment, aircraft NOx\nemissions were increased on a single perturbation level\nand the impact on O3 and CH4 abundances and the\ncorresponding changes in radiative forcing were investigated.\nFigure 1b shows the annual total emissions on each pertur-\nbation level.\n[10] In order to investigate sensitivities with respect to\ncruise altitude and magnitude of perturbation, emissions on\nperturbation levels 1\u201311 (5\u201311.7 km) were locally in-\ncreased by 5% relative to the reference emissions. At\nselected levels, additional experiments with increases of\n10% and 20% were carried out. The magnitude and location\nof these perturbations might represent the introduction of a\nnew additional aircraft type to the existing global fleet. By\ncomparing the atmospheric impact, normalized by the size\nFigure 1. (a) AERO2k aircraft NO2 emissions for 2002 in kg N a\n\u00011 per 1\u0001 \u0002 1\u0001 \u0002 500 ft grid cell.

In addition it is\npossible to study the relationship between the atmospheric\nresponse and emission increases of varying magnitude.\nAbove level 11 (11.4 km) the total emitted NOx in the\nreference emission distribution declines rapidly such that an\nincrease of 20% or less is too small to produce a reliable\nresponse in the model calculations after normalization.\n[11] In further experiments the atmospheric sensitivity to\nchanges in the geographical distribution of aircraft emissions\nis investigated at different perturbation levels. Figure 2a\nshows the geographical distribution of aircraft emissions for\neach perturbation level expressed as a percentage of the\nglobal horizontal model domain. Aircraft emissions cover\napproximately 60% of the globe on perturbation levels 1\u201311\nwith a maximum coverage at level 10. This geographical\ncoverage becomes significantly smaller at altitudes above\nlevel 11 (see Figure 1). Figures 2b\u20132d show the geograph-\nical distributions of the emission perturbations on levels 11,\n14, and 16 as examples and illustrates that not only do total\nemissions decrease, but the geographical distribution of the\nemissions becomes more limited. In order to address the\nconcern that any apparent change in the impact of emissions\nas a function of altitude could in reality be due to the change\nin sensitivity to both horizontal and vertical distribution of\nemissions, two types of geographical perturbation experi-\nment were carried out for levels 12\u201316 (11.7\u201314.8 km). In\nthe first experiment type, referred to as \u2018\u2018CG\u2019\u2019 (Constant\nGeographical distribution), the additional emissions created\nby a 5% local increase on level 11 were vertically shifted to\nperturbation levels 12\u201316 while maintaining the geograph-\nical distribution and magnitude exhibited on level 11. In the\nsecond experiment type, referred to as \u2018\u2018VG\u2019\u2019 (Varying\nGeographical distribution), the emissions on levels 12\u201316\nwere scaled such that the total global emission increase on\neach level was equal in size to the emission increase from a\n5% scaling on level 11. For each level 12\u201316 an individual\nscaling factor was used in VG, but the geographical coverage\nof the emissions remained unchanged from that in the\nreference distribution. It is important to note that, in conse-\nquence, the size of the emission change in both experiments\nCG and VG is equal in mass for each perturbation level, but\nthat the geographical coverage varies.\n4. Effects of Aircraft Emissions\n[12] The inclusion of AERO2k aircraft NOx emissions\nrelative to a case without aviation emissions leads to a net\nincrease in ozone by enhancing ozone production through\nincreased chemical cycling of NOx both in the troposphere\nand lower stratosphere. Some ozone loss occurs at high\naltitudes due to catalytic destruction. Figure 3 shows the\nchanges in ozone calculated by p-TOMCAT and SLIMCAT.\nOzone mixing ratios increase by approximately 6\u20139 ppbv in\nthe UTLS region, where aircraft emissions have the largest\nFigure 2. (a) Global coverage of emission perturbations in percent of the horizontal model grid for\neach perturbation level. (b)\u2013(d) Geographical distribution of NOx emission perturbations for levels 11,\n14, and 16.\nD11305 KO\u00a8HLER ET AL.: IMPACT OF PERTURBATIONS TO NITROGEN OXIDE EMISSIONS\n4 of 15\nD11305\nimpact. Transport of ozone to lower altitudes and latitudes\nleads to increased ozone levels throughout the troposphere\nwith the largest impact in the northern hemisphere. Rogers\net al. [2002] have shown that the SLIMCAT model exhibits\nan efficient uplift of subsonic aircraft emissions within the\n\u2018\u2018tropical pipe\u2019\u2019, which conversely results in an efficient\ndownward transport in the extra-tropics. This leads to the\nnear-tropopause maximum O3 increase from aircraft NOx to\nbe located in SLIMCAT at lower latitudes than in the p-\nTOMCAT model, and to the vertical transport of aircraft\nNOx to altitudes above 30 km. Above \u000325 km altitude\naircraft NOx emissions contribute to catalytic O3 destruction\nand result in a small decrease (5 ppbv) in stratospheric\nozone. In total, aircraft NOx leads to a global O3 burden\nincrease of 8.8 Tg. These findings are in reasonable agree-\nment with those from IPCC [1999], Grewe et al. [2002b]\nand with earlier TOMCAT results [Ko\u00a8hler et al., 2004].\nThey exceed slightly however the range of model results\nfrom the European TRADEOFF Project [Isaksen, 2003]\nwhich peak at 3\u20136 ppbv in the UTLS in July. Gauss et al.\n[2006a] report an annual mean O3 increase in the upper\ntroposphere of up to 4 ppbv. There are many possible\nreasons for the inter-model differences, including the emis-\nsions inventory and model formulations such as the chem-\nistry schemes, convective transport schemes, and wet\ndeposition schemes employed. One contributor to the dif-\nference is that the present work does not include the effect\nof plume processing of aircraft NOx emissions which have\nbeen estimated to reduce the effective emissions to the\nmodel gridboxes by up to 30% (M. Gauss, personal\ncommunication, 2007).\n[13] Ozone loss in the middle stratosphere is more pro-\nnounced in the SLIMCAT results, where, during the longer\nspin-up period, NOx from aircraft emissions is transported\nhigher into the middle stratosphere. Both models show good\nagreement in the meridional distribution of the \u2018\u2018crossover\npoint\u2019\u2019 between the domains with ozone increase and\ndecrease (\u000322 km, see Figure 3). We are therefore confident\nthat the results from the p-TOMCAT model are representa-\ntive for the troposphere and the lower stratosphere. At\naltitudes above the crossover point p-TOMCAT results\nbecome less representative due to the proximity of the\nupper boundary (32 km), the duration of the integration,\nand the absence of a complete stratospheric chemistry.\n[14] The partial ozone column changes below and above\nthe crossover point are given in Table 2. The ozone column\nincreases in the global and annual average due to aircraft\nemissions by 0.81 DU in p-TOMCAT and 0.83 DU in\nSLIMCAT with a strong bias to the northern hemisphere\nwhere more aircraft emissions are released. Figure 9 shows\nthe seasonal and meridional O3 column change in p-TOM-\nCAT. From June to November the monthly AERO2k\nemission rates are approximately 10% larger than during\nthe other months, with a maximum in August which\ncontributes to the autumn peak in the O3 column change.\nThese ozone column changes significantly exceed those\nshown by Stordal et al. [2006]. In p-TOMCAT the reduc-\ntion of the ozone column above the crossover point is\nsubstantially smaller than calculated by SLIMCAT for\nreasons mentioned above. These results show that subsonic\naircraft flying at present-day cruise altitudes affect ozone\nchemistry predominantly in the troposphere and lower\nstratosphere below 20 km altitude. The ozone impact above\nthis altitude is relatively small given the large background\nozone mixing ratios and, therefore, the fact that p-TOMCAT\nis restricted to a model domain below 10 hPa (32 km) is not\na significant disadvantage in these studies.\n[15] We diagnose the chemical production and loss of\nozone by considering the reactions listed in Table 3; the\nresults are shown in Figure 4. This approximation includes\nthe dominant terms relevant for ozone production and loss\nin the troposphere and lower stratosphere. Note, for exam-\nple, that catalytic ozone loss by NOx is less important in this\naltitude range than catalytic HOx cycles and therefore the\nNOx reactions are omitted in this approximation. Grewe et\nal. [2002a] have investigated the effects of lower cruise\naltitudes on ozone production rates by using a linear\nFigure 3.

In our study we diagnose reaction rate output\ndirectly from p-TOMCAT\u2019s chemistry module.\n[16] Figure 4 shows the change in O3 production and loss\nrates in July, as calculated by the p-TOMCAT model, due to\nthe inclusion of aircraft emissions. O3 production peaks in\nthe UTLS region where the largest amounts of NOx are\nemitted (Box A on Figure 4). At the same time ozone loss\nthrough its reaction with HO2 is reduced due to an increased\nreaction of HO2 with NO (Box B), further enhancing net O3\nproduction. A part of the additionally produced O3 is\ntransported from the upper troposphere to lower altitudes\nwhere, in the presence of water vapor, it results in increased\nHOx formation and therefore increased ozone loss (Box C).\nThe increased HOx levels in proximity to surface NOx\nemission sources lead to NOx being tied up more efficiently\nin reservoir species, such as HNO3. We diagnose significant\nHNO3 increases in p-TOMCAT near the surface. This\nresults in a reduction of the gross O3 production rate at\nlow altitudes (Box D). This process has previously been\nidentified [e.g., Stevenson et al., 2004] and is even stronger\nduring winter (not shown). It should be noted that net ozone\nproduction due to aircraft NOx emissions occurs only above\n5 km altitude and exhibits a maximum at approximately\n10 km where the largest amounts of NOx are emitted by\naviation. Therefore the increase in ozone below 5 km, seen\nin Figure 3, is due to advection of ozone from above, rather\nthan by in situ production. Moreover, the transport of\nenhanced O3 due to aviation from above is responsible for\nthe reduction in the net chemical O3 production below 5 km\nby enhancing the conversion from NOx to HNO3.\n[17] Aircraft NOx emissions increase OH levels primarily\nthrough additional production of O3 and additionally by\nshifting the HOx balance in favor of OH [Stevenson et al.,\n2004; Berntsen et al., 2005]. The reaction of NO and HO2\noccurs predominantly at cruise altitude whereas OH pro-\nduction via the photolysis of ozone in the presence of water\nvapor is particularly efficient in the lower troposphere at\nlower latitudes and involves transport of ozone into this\nregion. This increase in tropospheric OH strengthens the\nprincipal loss reaction of OH with CH4 such that aircraft\nemissions are responsible for a reduction of the global\nmethane lifetime by 3.0%. This result is in agreement with\nthe range of values predicted by IPCC [1999] for the period\nbetween 1992 and 2015 after a feedback factor has been\napplied. Stordal et al. [2006] however report significantly\nsmaller reductions in CH4 lifetime.\n[18] The reduction in atmospheric methane has a second-\nary long-term impact on O3 which is smaller than the direct\nO3 impact by NOx. The O3 increase diagnosed from a\nreference experiment with 5% more methane, which was\nused to establish the feedback factor, was linearly interpo-\nlated to determine the long-term O3 change due to a\nFigure 4.

The change in the\nCH4 lifetime due to aircraft NOx reduces the global O3\ncolumn by 0.27 DU and surface mixing ratios are reduced\nby approximately 0.1\u20130.2 ppbv. Despite being small, the\nfact that this constitutes a relatively long-lived perturbation\nmeans that it can make a significant contribution to the\nintegrated climate effect of aviation emissions [e.g., Wild et\nal., 2001; Stevenson et al., 2004].\n5. Effects of Emission Increases\n[19] Perturbations to aircraft NOx emissions have an\nimpact on atmospheric chemistry on both local and global\nscales. Ozone formation is affected both at the location of\nthe emissions and further downwind following precursor\ntransport. Ozone and NOx reservoir species have sufficiently\nlong lifetimes to be transported over significant distances\nand as such influence the oxidizing capacity of the tropo-\nsphere globally. The changes in the oxidizing capacity affect\nthe lifetime of methane which is of the order of a decade,\nand therefore changes in methane are evenly distributed\nthroughout the troposphere on a global scale. In order to\nconsider the global atmospheric impacts of NOx as a\nfunction of the altitude of the emission perturbation, we\nfocus in the following section on the changes to the global\nburdens of O3 and CH4.\n[20] In the altitude range 5\u201315 km, where in the\nfollowing experiments emissions are perturbed, aircraft\nNOx emissions are found to result in net chemical ozone\nproduction (see previous section) and thus on all 16\nperturbation levels an emission increase causes an increase\nof the global ozone burden. Emissions are increased by\n5% on individual perturbation levels. Figure 5a shows the\nglobal ozone burden change normalized by the emission\nincrease on each level for perturbation levels 1\u201311 (5\u2013\n11.7 km). With increasing altitude the NOx balance is\nshifted in favor of NO due to the temperature dependence\nof the reaction of NO with O3 [Wild et al., 1996; Jaegle\u00b4 et\nal., 1998b], reducing the conversion rate of NOx to HNO3\nand thus increasing the NOx lifetime with altitude. Liu et\nal. [1987] and Lin et al. [1988] have introduced the\nconcept of the ozone production efficiency (OPE) as the\nratio between production of ozone and loss of nitrogen\noxides, which quantifies the efficiency of a NOx molecule\nin producing ozone during its lifetime. We calculate the\nOPE in January and July from the change in gross O3\nproduction due to an emission perturbation and from the\nassociated change in loss of NOx. Our findings show that\nmore than 97% of the NOx emission perturbation is\nconverted into NOy and therefore we approximate the loss\nof NOx as being equal to the size of the emission\nperturbation. In both months we find that the OPE\nincreases with altitude in the troposphere with a particu-\nlarly sharp increase in the upper troposphere. Correspond-\ningly Figure 5a shows that the impact on the total ozone\nburden increases with the altitude of the applied emission\nchange. Emission changes at higher altitude are much\nmore likely to be transported into the stratosphere and\ntherefore at higher altitudes of the emission change a\nlarger proportion of the stratospheric ozone burden is\nperturbed.\n[21] The impact of NOx emissions on the lifetime of\nmethane and its dependence on altitude are shown in\nFigure 5b. The photolysis of additional ozone, produced\nfrom aircraft NOx emissions, in the presence of water vapor\nleads to the formation of OH and results in a reduction of the\nCH4 lifetime. This process is particularly efficient when\nozone production is large, and when ozone is transported to\nlower altitudes and latitudes where ambient H2O concentra-\ntions and solar radiation levels are high. An increase in NOx\nemissions in regions with high ozone production efficiency,\nsuch as the upper troposphere, results in a larger reduction\nFigure 5. (a) Global (solid line) and tropospheric (dotted line) O3 burden increase in p-TOMCAT due to\na 5% NOx emission increase for each perturbation level, normalized by the global emission increase. The\ntropopause is defined as the 2 PVU surface.

At\n11.5 km altitude the lifetime decrease is 26% larger than\nat 10 km, while the impact is approximately constant below\nthis altitude.\n6. Linearity in the Chemical Response\n[22] Having established the importance of the altitude\ndependence of NOx emissions, we now investigate the\neffects of increasing the size of the emission perturbation.\nThis provides a test of the robustness of the earlier results by\nscaling the emissions with varying scaling factors. To do\nthis the emissions are increased by 10% and 20% on one\nperturbation level at a time and results are compared with\nthose from a 5% emission scaling. Because of the compu-\ntational costs involved with the model integrations these\nexperiments were only carried out on perturbation levels 2,\n5, 8, and 11 (at 5.9, 7.8, 9.6, and 11.4 km, cf. Table 1) which\nspan the vertical extent of the free troposphere.\n[23] The results of emission scaling on the global ozone\nburden and the lifetime of methane are shown in Figure 6,\nand show that the response in ozone and methane is entirely\nlinear for scaling factors up to 20% of the reference\nemissions. At higher altitudes the increase in the ozone\nburden and the reduction in the methane lifetime from the\nperturbation are stronger, in agreement with our findings\nfrom section 5. A further experiment with 200% emission\nscaling carried out on level 11 results in a global ozone\nburden increase that is only 5.3% smaller than the expected\nburden increase applying a linear scaling. This indicates that\na linear atmospheric response may be valid even for\nemission scaling that significantly exceeds 20% at 11.4 km.\n[24] In addition to the linearity in the total ozone burden\nwe find that the vertical and horizontal distribution of the\nozone perturbation is not altered by the emission scaling.\nFigure 7 shows the change in the vertical ozone profile\n(zonal mean) at 60\u0001N caused by emission perturbations\nbetween 5% and 20% with respect to the reference exper-\niment as calculated in p-TOMCAT and SLIMCAT. The\nchange in the ozone profile at 20% is twice as large as for\n10% changes and four times as large as for the 5% emission\nincrease. This linearity is found in p-TOMCAT below the\ncrossover point and in SLIMCAT throughout the vertical\nmodel domain. The duration of the p-TOMCAT model\nintegrations and the proximity of the upper boundary\nexplain the non-linearities seen in the p-TOMCAT results\nabove 18 km. The SLIMCAT results, which are not subject\nto these issues, show that the linearity in the O3 change due\nto NOx perturbations is valid throughout the stratosphere.\nGrewe et al. [1999] and Isaksen et al. [2001] have shown by\nemploying future aircraft emission scenarios that the atmo-\nspheric ozone response to a global increase in aircraft NOx\nemissions is approximately linear, even when changes to the\natmospheric background conditions are taken into account.\nThe findings from our study are consistent and show that\nthe response to emission increases at individual cruise\naltitude bands is also linear.\n[25] In addition to linear scaling of the emission size we\ninvestigate whether the atmospheric response to emissions\nat different cruise altitude bands is additive. Experiments are\ncarried out with emissions scaled by 5% over two neigh-\nboring perturbation levels at once. We find that the sum of\nthe ozone changes from individual perturbations applied\naccounts for more than 96% of the ozone change when the\nperturbation is applied to both levels simultaneously. These\nexperiments were carried out for levels 2, 5, 8, and 11 and\ntheir respective lower neighboring level. The discrepancies\nin the vertical additivity of the ozone burdens vary in size\nand sign, but remain consistently below 4% of the burden\nchange.\n7. Effects of the Geographical Distribution of\nEmissions\n[26] So far our results have shown that the atmospheric\nchange due to small emission perturbations is both linear\nand nearly additive in response to a scaling of the reference\nemissions, provided the regional distribution of the emis-\nsions remains unchanged. In this section we investigate the\natmospheric sensitivity to changes in the geographical\ndistribution of the emissions, as performed in experiments\nCG and VG described in section 3.\nFigure 6. (a) Global changes in the ozone burden and (b) methane lifetime in p-TOMCAT due to\nscaling of aircraft emissions by 5%, 10% and 20% at perturbation levels 2, 5, 8, and 11, demonstrating\nthe linear response.\nD11305 KO\u00a8HLER ET AL.: IMPACT OF PERTURBATIONS TO NITROGEN OXIDE EMISSIONS\n8 of 15\nD11305\n[27] Figure 8 shows the normalized changes in O3\nburden and CH4 lifetime as calculated in the VG experi-\nments on levels 12\u201316, where aircraft routing remains the\nsame as for the reference emissions for the given level,\nand also those from the CG experiments where the\ngeographical flight distribution pattern of level 11 was\nused. It can be seen in Figure 8a that the O3 burden varies\nsignificantly between the individual perturbation levels in\nthe VG experiments (squares). In the CG experiments the\nresults show a continuous increase in the global ozone\nFigure 7.

The red and green dashed lines show the 5% and 10% scalings\nmultiplied by factors of 4 and 2 respectively for comparison with the 20% scaling.\nFigure 8.

The\ndifference between the lines with squares and crosses\ndemonstrates the importance of the geographical distribu-\ntion of the emissions. Figures 2b\u20132d show how the peak\nin emissions varies with latitude; the sharp increase in the\nO3 burden at level 16 in the VG experiment in Figure 8a\nis most likely a consequence of the emissions peak being\nlocated at lower latitudes in the Middle Eastern region. At\nlevel 14 the emissions peak is located over the U.S. and\nthe North Atlantic Flight Corridor, at higher latitudes by\ncomparison. In experiments CG the vertical shift of the\nemission perturbations from level 11 to higher altitudes\nresults in an ozone response which is in general signifi-\ncantly stronger, both in the tropospheric and global bur-\ndens, than that caused by the emission distribution\ncorresponding to actual flight routes on the same levels.\nFor level 14 the ozone increase is 50% larger when\nemission distributions from level 11 are used compared\nto the original distribution, even though the total emitted\nNOx is the same. The strong variability in the ozone\nresponse seen above level 11 in experiments VG is solely\nan artifact of the emission distribution and cannot be\ninterpreted as a change in the sensitivity of atmospheric\nozone with respect to NOx emission increases. In fact,\nexperiments CG show that with increasing altitude up to\n14.5 km ozone production becomes increasingly sensitive\nto changes in NOx emissions.\n[28] For emission increases on levels 12\u201316 the majority\nof the perturbations are located within the stratosphere and\nwith increasing altitude a larger proportion of the ozone\nincrease also occurs within the stratosphere. The stability\nabove the tropopause prevents the downward transport of\nozone to lower altitudes where it contributes efficiently to\nOH production. Moreover H2O mixing ratios in the lower\nstratosphere are much lower than in the lower troposphere\nresulting in less in situ OH production. Therefore the impact\nof NOx emissions on the CH4 lifetime decreases with\naltitude above level 12 in the CG experiment when the\nemission perturbations and ozone changes are located\nwithin the stratosphere, as seen in Figure 8b. Again the\nregional redistribution of the emission perturbations results\nin a large impact on the CH4 lifetime, as shown by the\ndifference between experiments CG and VG (crosses and\nsquares).\n[29] The extent to which changes in flight routing were\napplied in this study\u2014by vertically shifting the emission\nperturbations of level 11\u2014represents a significant but not\nentirely unrealistic alteration. The results show that the basis\nfunctions describing the linear and additive atmospheric\nresponse are dependent on the geographical distribution of\nthe emissions and cannot be applied any longer when the\ngeographical distribution has been altered significantly. This\npresents an important restriction to the formulation of a\nparametric relationship and merits further investigation. It is\nwell established in models that the impact of NOx surface\nemissions on ozone change is strongly dependent on the\nlocation of those emissions (see e.g., Berntsen et al. [2005],\nWild et al. [2001] and references therein). Our study\nindicates that this also holds for emissions from aviation.\nHence any change in the geographical distribution of\nemissions (for example due to growth in emerging markets\nin sub-tropical Asia) could lead to significant impacts on\nozone and methane levels, even if the overall global\nemissions remain constant.\n8. Radiative Forcing\n[30] Radiative forcings due to changes in ozone from\naircraft NOx emissions were calculated using a narrow band\nradiative transfer scheme, with 250 bands (10 cm\u00011) in the\nthermal infrared, 5 nm spectral resolution in the ultraviolet\nand 10 nm spectral resolution in the visible [Forster and\nShine, 1997]; climatological cloud amounts were taken from\nRossow and Schiffer [1999]. The monthly mean changes in\nozone due to aviation for 2002 were used in the forcing\ncalculations. Stratospheric temperature adjustment was in-\ncluded using the fixed dynamical heating approximation. Its\nimpact was found to reduce the global annual mean instan-\ntaneous forcing due to air traffic by about \u00019%, which is a\nsmaller effect than found for purely tropospheric ozone\ncases [e.g., Berntsen et al., 1997] probably because of the\nstratospheric component of the ozone forcing due to avia-\ntion NOx. Because of the large number of perturbation\nexperiments, the stratospheric adjustment was calculated\nonly for four months for every second experiment. The\nsame relative difference between instantaneous and adjusted\nforcings was found for these cases as for the case with\nreference aircraft emissions versus the case without aircraft\nemissions. Therefore the \u00019% adjustment factor was ap-\nplied to all the global annual means of instantaneous\nforcings.\n[31] For the radiative forcing due to methane, a simpler\napproach is appropriate, in common with other similar\nstudies [e.g., Stordal et al., 2006]. Results from sophisti-\ncated radiative forcing codes have been shown to be well-\nrepresented by curve fits [IPCC, 2001]. For the relatively\nsmall methane perturbations found here, a linearization of\nthis forcing around present-day methane amounts (1740\nppbv, and assuming background nitrous oxide concentra-\ntions of 319 ppbv, to account for spectral overlap) gives\n0.37 mWm\u00012 ppbv\u00011.\n[32] Note that we use radiative forcing as a way of\nquantifying and comparing the climate effect of aviation\nNOx emissions, but two important caveats are necessary.\nFirst, there has been much recent work comparing the\nefficacy of different forcings; the efficacy gives the ratio\nof global-mean surface temperature change for a 1 Wm\u00012\nforcing due to a given forcing mechanism compared to the\nsurface temperature change for a 1 Wm\u00012 forcing due to a\nchange in carbon dioxide. As shown by Ponater et al.\n[2006], efficacies due to aviation-induced forcings can\ndepart significantly from unity; for their model, Ponater et\nal. [2006] find values of 1.37 for ozone and 1.18 for\nmethane forcings. We do not apply these efficacies here\nas it is necessary to establish the degree of model depen-\ndence of these results, but they are nevertheless indicative of\na possible significant effect. The second caveat, which is to\nsome extent related to the efficacy issue, is that caution must\nbe exercised in comparing the apparently offsetting effects\nof the positive ozone and negative methane forcings, as the\nformer is concentrated in the northern hemisphere, while the\nlatter is global in extent [e.g., IPCC, 1999].\n[33] The cloudy-sky global-mean adjusted radiative forc-\ning, due to the NOx-induced ozone changes from the\nD11305 KO\u00a8HLER ET AL.: IMPACT OF PERTURBATIONS TO NITROGEN OXIDE EMISSIONS\n10 of 15\nD11305\nAERO2k emissions derived using the p-TOMCAT model,\nwas found to be 30 mWm\u00012 relative to the case with no\naviation emissions. This value is consistent with the IPCC\n[1999] value of 23 mWm\u00012, which was derived for NOx\nemissions of 0.58 Tg N a\u00011; simple linear scaling to the\nAERO2k value of 0.68 Tg N a\u00011 would yield a forcing of\n27 mWm\u00012.\n[34] Our value is somewhat greater than the mid-range\nvalue of 22 mWm\u00012 given by Sausen et al. [2005]; they\nreport, without details, a range of 12\u201328 mWm\u00012 using the\nTRADEOFF inventory for the year 2000 and a range of\nchemistry transport models and radiation codes. Stordal et\nal. [2006] report a reduced range of 11 to 16 mWm\u00012 for a\nsubset of the models used by Sausen et al. [2005] and for\nemissions of 0.59 Tg N a\u00011. It is also known that the\nradiation code used by Stordal et al. [2006] yields forcings\nabout 11% lower than the code used here [Gauss et al.,\n2006b]. However, adjusting for this difference and the\ndifference in NOx emissions would alter the Stordal et al.\n[2006] range to 14 to 20 mWm\u00012, still smaller than our\nresult. As discussed in section 4, p-TOMCAT yields signif-\nicantly larger changes in ozone than the models used for\nforcing calculations in the Stordal et al. [2006] study and\nthis accounts for most of the difference in the ozone forcing.\nBy contrast, Ponater et al. [2007] report a forcing of\n60 mWm\u00012 for the DLR 2015 emissions scenario [Grewe\net al., 2002b] which corresponds to 1.18 Tg N a\u00011; simple\nlinear scaling would yield a forcing of 35 mWm\u00012 using the\nAERO2k NOx emissions.\n[35] The monthly and global-mean forcing is shown in\nFigure 9a and shows a strong peak in forcing in September\nto November, consistent with the peak change in ozone.\nFigure 9a also shows, as expected, the dominance of the\nlongwave forcing over the shortwave forcing. Figure 9b\nshows the annual and zonal-mean adjusted forcings to\nallow comparison with other work [e.g., IPCC, 1999;\nStordal et al., 2006] and emphasizes the northern hemi-\nsphere dominance of this forcing for the current aviation\nfleet. The marked secondary peak at 20\u0001S in Figure 9b is\nentirely absent by Hauglustaine et al. [1994]. There is a\nsmaller secondary peak in the work of IPCC [1999] (see\ntheir Figures 5\u20138) and there are hints of a small peak in\nthe three models reported by Stordal et al. [2006]. As\nshown by Stordal et al. [2006], the TOMCAT model (the\npredecessor to the model used here) has a heightened\nsouthern hemisphere ozone response to aviation emissions,\nand a more marked secondary peak, than the other models\nin that study. Figure 10 shows the annual-mean geograph-\nical distribution of total ozone change and forcing. It\nshows that the peak in forcing is displaced much more\ntoward the equator than the emissions themselves (cf.\nFigure 3). This is partially because of the location of the\nozone changes (Figure 10a), but also because a given\nchange in tropospheric ozone is much more effective at\ncausing radiative forcing at lower latitudes particularly\nover warm, relatively high albedo surfaces such as deserts\n[e.g., Berntsen et al., 1997].\n[36] The impact of the NOx perturbation experiments\n(section 5) on radiative forcing are shown both for a 5%\nchange in NOx emissions in Figure 11a and normalized to\nthe NOx emissions in Figure 11b. The 5% plot shows a\nstrong peak at 10.5 km, coincident with the peak in NOx\nemissions (cf. Figure 1). The normalized plot shows a\ngeneral increase in forcing per Tg N a\u00011 emitted with\naltitude \u2013 the structure in the 11\u201313 km region is because\nthese calculations use the VG experiments (cf. Figure 8), so\npart of the variation is due to the change in the geographical\ndistribution of the fleet with altitude. The dominant driver of\nthe vertical variation between 11 and 15 km altitude is that,\nas shown in Figure 5, a given emission of NOx leads to a\ngreater ozone increase at higher altitudes. Although a given\nchange in ozone is generally more important for radiative\nforcing if it is located near the tropopause, this is a\nsecondary effect in driving the vertical variation of the\nforcing as a function of the altitude of perturbation. Advec-\ntion by the circulation means that the perturbation to ozone\nis not strongly constrained to the altitude at which NOx is\nperturbed. We find that the forcing per change in column\nozone burden varies by only 10% with height of NOx\nperturbation; the peak effect is for perturbation level 7\n(about 9 km).\n[37] The radiative forcing due to the methane lifetime\ndecrease of 3.0% (section 4) is about \u000119 mWm\u00012, again\nvery similar to the IPCC [1999] value when scaled for\nFigure 9.

[2005]), yields a\nslightly less negative forcing of \u00018 mWm\u00012.\n[39] Hence the sum of the forcings due to short-lived\nozone response, the methane response, and the methane-\ninduced ozone is close to zero, in the global mean, empha-\nsizing the importance of including the ozone response to\nmethane change. Using the p-TOMCAT results, the ozone\nforcing due to the methane change is 0.59 times the methane\nforcing itself, for present-day methane concentrations. This\nratio is also used to calculate the height variation of\nmethane-induced ozone forcing.\n[40] Figure 11 shows the methane radiative forcing as a\nfunction of height of the NOx perturbation. As expected, this\nbroadly follows the ozone forcing in shape, as both forcings\nare mostly dependent on the efficiency with which NOx\nemissions change ozone amount. However, the normalized\nmethane forcings per Tg N a\u00011 do not increase as rapidly as\nthe ozone forcings in the stratosphere, because ozone\nchanges in the stratosphere are less effective at changing\ntropospheric OH.\n[41] Figure 11 also shows the simple estimate of the\nmethane-induced ozone change, which is taken to be 0.59\ntimes the methane forcing, and the sum of the three\nforcings. The normalized forcings (per Tg N a\u00011) for ozone\nand methane, as a function of the altitude of NOx perturba-\ntion are also listed in Table 1.\n9. Conclusions\n[42] The impact of perturbations to a range of aircraft\nNOx emission parameters on ozone and methane and the\nassociated radiative forcing changes were investigated with\ntwo chemistry transport models and an off-line radiative\ntransfer code. Initially the atmospheric impact of the unper-\nturbed NOx emissions from aviation in 2002 was calculated,\nusing a new emission inventory and an updated version of\nthe p-TOMCAT 3D chemistry transport model. Subsequent-\nly, the sensitivity toward changes in cruise altitude, the size\nof the emission perturbation and the geographical distribu-\ntion of global emissions were investigated. Results from the\nSLIMCAT model reveal the long-term response at higher\naltitudes and demonstrate that the responses generated with\np-TOMCAT in the critical upper troposphere\/lower strato-\nsphere region are reliable, and therefore provide evidence\nand additional support that p-TOMCAT is fit-for-purpose\nfor these aircraft studies.\n[43] Aircraft NOx emissions increase the ozone mixing\nratios in the troposphere and UTLS region, with a maximum\nincrease of 6 ppbv in the zonal annual mean and a global\nincrease in the O3 column of 0.81 DU. This is consistent\nwith earlier results from TOMCAT and with results from\nIPCC [1999] and Grewe et al. [2002b] after linear scaling of\ntheir total aircraft emissions to AERO2k values. Results\nhere however exceed those reported in TRADEOFF\n[Isaksen, 2003; Gauss et al., 2006a; Stordal et al., 2006].\nThe increase in ozone and the associated increase in the\ntroposphere\u2019s oxidizing capacity has resulted in a reduction\nin the lifetime of methane by 3.0%. The ozone increase has\nled to an additional radiative forcing of 30 mWm\u00012. This\nforcing is consistent with results from IPCC [1999], after the\nincrease in NOx emissions since 1992 is taken into account,\nand consistent with the top end of the range (28 mWm\u00012)\ngiven by Sausen et al. [2005]. Clearly there remains\nsignificant uncertainty in the forcing, with most of this\nuncertainty being driven by uncertainty in the change in\nozone from the aviation emissions. The methane decrease\nresulting from the ozone change is estimated to be\n\u000119 mWm\u00012 and we make a simple estimate of the forcing\ndue to methane-induced ozone forcing, which yields a value\nof \u000111 mWm\u00012. Hence the sum of the forcing from the\nthree mechanisms considered here is, at least in the global\nmean, close to zero.\n[44] The impact of aircraft NOx emissions on ozone and\nmethane depends significantly on cruise altitude, reflecting\nthe increase in ozone production efficiency with altitude. An\nemission increase in the upper troposphere at 11 km leads to\na 200% larger ozone increase and a 40% stronger reduction\nin methane lifetime per emitted mass of NOx than an\nemission increase at 5 km altitude. Net chemical formation\nof ozone increased only above 5 km such that ozone\nincreases below this altitude are due to downward transport\nof additional ozone being produced in higher regions. In the\nlower troposphere aircraft NOx emissions lead to a reduction\nof the net ozone production, as the downward transport of\naircraft-induced O3, produced in the UTLS region, provides\nan additional local source of HOx resulting in an increased\nloss of O3 and leading to nitrogen oxides at low altitudes\nbeing more efficiently tied up in nitric acid.\n[45] The scaling of emissions at several cruise altitude\nbands has revealed that small changes in emissions (locally\n5\u201320%) lead to a linear response in the O3-NOx-CH4\nsystem and the associated radiative forcings. Moreover it\nwas found that the effects from emission perturbations are\napproximately additive, such that the sum of the impacts\nfrom emission changes at different levels is near equal to the\nimpact when emissions are perturbed simultaneously at all\nlevels. Initial experiments with significantly larger scaling\nfactors indicate that the linearity in the atmospheric re-\nsponse may be valid for scaling factors much larger than\nused in this study. This linear relationship can be used in\nfuture work to estimate the atmospheric impact of changes\nto a reference emission profile without the need to carry out\nchemistry transport model integrations, provided that the\ngeographical distribution of the emissions remains unal-\ntered. This restriction forms an important limitation to the\napplicability of a linear parameterization.\n[46] Global aircraft emissions exhibit a maximum in\nterms of emitted mass and global coverage at 10\u201312 km\naltitude, above which they decrease rapidly with altitude.\nCorrespondingly their impact on ozone and methane rea-\nches a maximum at 10\u201312 km altitude. In spite of further\nincreasing ozone production efficiency with altitude in the\nlower stratosphere, the variation of the geographical cover-\nage of emissions results in a decrease in aircraft-induced\nozone production and the impact on methane above 12 km.\nWe have shown that a change to this coverage in the lower\nstratosphere, while maintaining the total amounts emitted,\ncan lead to significant variations in the impact on ozone and\nmethane. Changes applied to the geographical distribution\nof emissions result in a significant response in atmospheric\nozone and methane that cannot be described by the linear\nbase functions established earlier through emission scaling.\nThis has important consequences for future air traffic\ngrowth, together with changes to flight routing as a result\nD11305 KO\u00a8HLER ET AL.: IMPACT OF PERTURBATIONS TO NITROGEN OXIDE EMISSIONS\n13 of 15\nD11305\nof Air Traffic Control or operational procedures. In our\nstudy we investigated the impact of regional emission\nchanges only at altitudes above 11.5 km where flight\nrouting coverage changes substantially with altitude. Sen-\nsitivity to flight route distributions is likely to be found also\nat lower altitudes, although we expect the impact to be\nsmaller as the total geographical coverage of emissions\nexhibits less variability at lower altitudes.\n[47] Acknowledgments.
