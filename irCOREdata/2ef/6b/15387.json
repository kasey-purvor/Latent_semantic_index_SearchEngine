Moving between the disciplines of archaeology, cultural \ngeography, and heritage and tourism studies, the paper draws upon a variety of data \nsources such as paintings, photographs, models and reconstructions to consider how the \nWall is visually represented within contemporary public discourse. The paper focuses on \ndigital photography and considers the ways in which images create and sustain particular \nreadings of the Wall\u201fs function and significance. These contemporary representational \npractices demonstrate strong continuities and earlier images are used to provide historical \ncontext. Emphasis is placed on the monument\u201fs landscape setting in visual \nrepresentations and the importance of this environmental context for readings of the Wall\u201fs \ncultural and political significance. The present paper deals primarily with representations of \nthe Wall, but it is argued that these representational practices are also fundamentally \nembodied. The physical encounters of visitors and archaeologists will be considered in \ngreater detail in the second part of this study (Witcher in press). \nKeywords \nHadrian\u201fs Wall; World Heritage; representation; landscape; photography; digital \nethnography; imageability \n1. Introduction \nThe fabulous tales of the common people concerning this wall I doe wittingly and willingly overpasse. \n(Camden Britain, 1610). \nWriting the first topographical survey of the British Isles, William Camden set out to \n\u201crestore antiquity to Britaine, and Britaine to his antiquity\u201d. His attention was inevitably \ndrawn to the ruins of a massive Roman fortification which crossed the north of England \u2013 \nthe Pict\u201fs Wall. In describing the structure and its historical importance, Camden drew on \npublished accounts, correspondence with local observers and, eventually, his own first-\nhand experience of the Wall (visiting in 1599, in time for his fourth edition). Despite his \nintention to pass over the \u201cfabulous tales of the common people concerning this wall\u201d in \norder to focus on the facts as he saw them, he goes on to relate a local story about the \nRoman garrison planting medicinal herbs on the Wall. Camden\u201fs conceptual division of \npopular and scholarly accounts of the Pict\u201fs \u2013 or Hadrian\u201fs \u2013 Wall has endured over the \nsubsequent four centuries. In particular, during the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, \nthe emergence of the discipline of archaeology formalized and rigorously enforced the \ndivision between professional and popular, fact and folklore.   \nToday, however, the need and desire of archaeology to engage with the public and to \ndemocratize the discipline raise new questions about the value of the \u201etales of the common \npeople\u201f. This paper focuses on those tales as communicated principally through digital \nmedia and considers them in the context of two current themes in the disciplines of \narchaeology, cultural geography, and heritage and tourism studies: i.e. representation and \n 2 \nembodiment. This paper, the first of two, draws on research which aims to explore the \nrecursive relationship between representation and embodiment, or between imagery and \nexperience. Specifically, it considers the evidence for contemporary representations of, \nand visits to, the monuments now encompassed within the \u201eFrontiers of the Roman \nEmpire\u201f World Heritage Site (WHS). This subject is contextualized with brief discussion of \nthe history of the image-making and visiting practices of Hadrian\u201fs Wall.i In particular, the \narchaeological monument is considered within its wider landscape setting in order to \nunderstand the importance of its physical context for interpretations of the Wall\u201fs meaning \nand significance in both popular and scholarly accounts. \nAs it covers much ground and crosses many disciplinary boundaries, it is perhaps \nimportant to stress what this research is not. Hadrian\u201fs Wall is one of the most intensively \nstudied and best understood of any archaeological monument in Britain. The last decade \nhas witnessed a particularly rich period for Wall studies (summarized in Hodgson 2009) \nincluding new insights from developer-funded excavations and extensive geophysical \nsurveys, as well as the publication of old excavations, a comprehensive Research \nFramework (Symonds & Mason 2009) and a new edition of the Handbook (Breeze 2006). \nThe present paper does not deal with this material in terms of evidence for the Roman \npast, but rather in terms of its reception in the present. It will become clear that both the \nhistory and future of Wall studies is closely connected with visualization and visiting \npractices. Likewise, this is not a traditional tourist study which aims to generate \nmeasurable data about visitor responses or to conduct an evaluation based on pre-\ndetermined categories such as age or nationality. Rather, it develops an initial exploration \nof the chronically underexploited digital resources created and shared online by visitors. In \nother words, it bypasses conventional approaches which assess how visitors consume \npre-packaged heritage sites and advocates a more dynamic situation where visitors \ncreate, narrate and project their own images and interpretations (see Crang 1997).  \nIn order to tease apart the complexities, discussion has been divided: the present paper \nexplores the representation of Hadrian\u201fs Wall focusing on the cultural biography of well-\nknown Wall views. It considers the reworking of these iconic images in visitor photographs \nas documented through user-generated online resources and a photo-questionnaire. The \nsecond part of this research (Witcher in press) moves from representation to embodied \nencounter and explores physical experience of the monument; it considers the extent to \nwhich familiarity and empathy with the Roman past actively obscures the sensory richness \nof this landscape and its potential as a reflexive and transformative space. It is important to \nstress that the division of representation and encounter between these two papers is \nnecessarily arbitrary; photography, for example, will be considered as an embodied \ntechnology of representation.ii  \n2. Methods & Approaches \nTo see the Wall you must walk. (Collingwood A Guide to the Roman Wall, 1932) \nVisitors to Hadrian\u201fs Wall are regularly surveyed about their experience by both academics \n(e.g. Kinghorn & Willis 2008) and by local authorities and heritage agencies (e.g. Powe & \nShaw 2003). The majority of these surveys use questionnaires to elicit responses. More \nrecent work has equipped visitors with disposable cameras who are then asked to discuss \nthe resulting images (Bell 2008; generally, Garrod 2007). The current paper draws on the \nresults of such surveys but also looks to the massive and expanding resource provided by \nonline user-generated content. \nIncreasingly, the public turns to the World Wide Web as a primary source of information. A \nsimple Google text search for \u201cHadrian\u201fs Wall\u201d returns hundreds of thousands of \nwebpages and tens of thousands of images. With the rise of Web 2.0, most of this material \nis generated and uploaded by the general public. By comparison, the online material \n 3 \nproduced by professional archaeologists and heritage managers is limited in quantity and \noften difficult for non-specialists to locate and understand. Xiang & Gretzel (2010) \ndemonstrate the powerful influence of user-generated material on the perception of tourist \ndestinations and in the planning of holidays because of the way in which it is indexed and \nreturned by search engines; user-generated images would appear to be even more \ndominant in such searches because of the rise of photo-sharing websites.  \nAlthough computer scientists and cognitive linguists have begun to engage with this \nenormous resource (e.g. Snavely et al. 2008), the social sciences and humanities have \nbeen slow to explore the potential. This may relate to issues of ethics (e.g. privacy) and to \nthe perception of these materials as low-grade by comparison to the richer data offered by \nquestionnaires or interviews where it is possible to achieve greater control (for general \nissues, Garcia et al. 2009). Following Pink (2008), the present paper emphasizes people\u201fs \nimage-making \u201eas it is\u201f rather than as directed by researchers. In particular, it focuses on \nthe way in which visitors use New Media, digital photography and Global Positioning \nSystems (GPS) to plan, mediate and represent their encounters. This approach has the \nadvantage of defusing one of the key drawbacks of participant work \u2013 the distorting effects \nof the \u201eanthropological gaze\u201f. However, it also raises some methodological issues. For \nexample, the rise of digital photography is likely to have changed image production and \ncuration practices; multiple photographs can now be taken and winnowed at no extra \nexpense. We might therefore expect that those images that are retained and shared online \nare only a heavily edited selection. Another consideration is the effect of the \u201edigital divide\u201f \n\u2013 that is, the uneven societal engagement with technology. These are significant issues. \nHowever, it is also important to recognize that these images exert a strong influence on \nthe public discourse of the Wall; for every person who shares online materials, many more \nview them (see below). Similarly, the \u201etags\u201f and comments attached to these photographs \nmay not convey the immediate thoughts and impressions which an interview can capture \nin the field (e.g. Bell 2008), but they do encompass the memories that the visitor recalls or \nwishes to share. Most importantly, the enormous size of this resource means that it can \ncapture a far larger and more diverse sample than traditional questionnaires or face-to-\nface interviews. In summary, the approach has advantages and disadvantages and should \nbe used to complement not to replace more detailed participant work.  \nThere is no established methodology within the social sciences for sampling and analyzing \nthis enormous and dynamic virtual resource. Future work might seek ways in which this \nconstantly evolving dataset can be more systematically characterized and understood. For \nthe present study, text searches were conducted on collaborative image-sharing websites \nto retrieve relevant photographs and associated \u201etags\u201f and comments. Some of these \nwebsites, such as Picasa, attract general-purpose users; others attract more specialized \nusers, for example, Flickr is popular with (semi-) professional photographers. Each website \noffers different possibilities to assess the context of individual photosets (e.g. other photo \nalbums uploaded by the same user). The aim was not to quantify particular trends but \nrather to establish an overall impression of the character and diversity of online materials. \nThis work identified a number of key themes which are broadly in line with the results of \nmore conventional surveys (e.g. Elliott-White & Cuthill 1998; ERA 2004: Appendix 2; Powe \n& Shaw 2003). In addition to photographs, a number of other online materials were \nsurveyed. These included websites for the sharing of GPS tracks such as \ngeocaching.com, tourist review sites (e.g. IgoUgo.com) and travel blogs.  \nFinally, the analysis of web materials was supplemented with two other techniques. First, a \nten-page booklet of photographs was distributed at five locations along the Wall including \na National Park visitor centre and guest houses. Visitors were given some context about \nthe wider project and asked to comment on any aspect of the photographs and to provide \nbrief details about themselves. Forty-seven questionnaires were returned. Of these, 62% \n 4 \nof respondents used the World Wide Web to research their visit, thus underlining its \nimportance as a primary source of information for the public. By contrast, just 17% of \nrespondents shared their own photographs online; the photo-questionnaire therefore \nsuccessfully captured many individuals who may be under-represented in the wider online \nsample. Again, the results were not subject to systematic analysis but rather were used \nqualitatively to identify recurring themes. The photographs, participant comments and word \nvisualizations form the basis of an exhibition which can be accessed online at \nwww.dur.ac.uk\/roman.centre\/hadrianswall\/phototext (see Fig. 1).  \n \nFigure 1. Visualization of participant comments on photograph of Sycamore Gap (see Fig. \n6) (Image generated at www.wordle.net).  \nSecond, in order to develop some historical perspective, a number of interviews with \nindividuals who live and work around the area were conducted, including National Park \nrangers, a local photographer and bed and breakfast proprietors. Most were conducted \nwhilst walking along the Wall (see Anderson 2004 on \u201etalking whilst walking\u201f).  \nAt the outset, it should be stressed that Roman remains are not the only reason that \nvisitors may choose to visit \u201eHadrian\u201fs Wall Country\u201f. As well as Roman monuments, the \nsurrounding landscape preserves a rich prehistoric and medieval heritage. But many \nvisitors have no direct interest in archaeology at all, choosing to walk, cycle, rock-climb, \nbird-watch and botanize in areas such as the Northumberland National Park and the \nSolway Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The current research does not aim to \nmake a distinction between those visitors who are specifically attracted by the Wall and \nthose whose primary motive is non-archaeological. Indeed, many visitors may not make \nsuch a distinction themselves, understanding the monument and its landscape as part of a \nsingle experience (Powe & Shaw 2003). Nonetheless, the methods employed will \ninevitably prioritize those people who are sufficiently aware of the existence of the \narchaeology to engage with the photo-questionnaire or to \u201etag\u201f and share online their \nphotographs of the Wall. \nOn the basis of the all these techniques, five recurrent themes can be identified: \n a) the distinction between photograph and content, or picture and place \n b) the merging of archaeology and landscape, or Culture and Nature  \n 5 \n c) colonial interpretations (e.g. Roman versus barbarian) \n d) function versus meaning, or admiration versus inspiration \n e) the use of empathy and\/or sympathy. \nIn the context of representation, the present paper puts particular emphasis on the first two \nthemes. The second part of this study (Witcher in press) turns attention to the third, fourth \nand fifth themes.  \n3. Picturing the Wall \n\u2026you see a smoke from East to West as far as the eye can turn, and then, under it, also as far as the eye \ncan stretch, houses and temples, shops and theatres, barracks and granaries, trickling along like dice behind \n- always behind - one long, low, rising and falling, and hiding and showing line of towers. And that is the \nWall! (Kipling Puck of Pook\u2019s Hill, 1906) \nThe interactivity facilitated by Web 2.0 and the associated explosion of user-generated \ncontent have diminished any simplistic division between the production and consumption \nof information. In particular, the online sharing of photographs means that \u201eamateur\u201f \nimagery may be as influential in the visual construction of places and destinations as \n\u201eprofessional\u201f photography. Nonetheless, to structure the following discussion, an artificial \ndivision will be imposed: this section will examine the emergence of canonical \nrepresentations of Hadrian\u201fs Wall which have, by and large, been established by \nprofessional artists and photographers during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. \nThe relationship of these iconic images to visitors\u201f photographs will be considered in the \nfollowing section. \nThe closely-related origins of archaeology, photography and tourism during the nineteenth \ncentury are the subject of recent scholarly interest (e.g. Lyons et al. 2005). At the heart of \nthis relationship is a tension between photographic representation as a technology for \nobjective documentation and as an artistic medium for evoking the spirit of places and \nmonuments. In the past, archaeological photography has actively defined itself as scientific \npractice and has sought to conceal the subjectivity of the medium beneath a veneer of \ntechnological objectivity in order to protect itself from art historical critique (Dorrell 1994 is \nthe standard work; for critiques, see Hamilakis et al. 2009; Russell 2006; Shanks 1997). \nThere is a similar tension around the role of imagery in the promotion of tourist \ndestinations. The images in brochures and holiday websites aim to attract visitors using \nselectivity and embellishment, but these images must also retain some semblance of the \nreality which visitors may subsequently experience and judge. Hadrian\u201fs Wall provides a \nparticularly clear example of an archaeological site and a tourist destination where the \ntension between subjective and objective photographic representation is poorly concealed \n(see below). \nToday, Hadrian\u201fs Wall is established as an integral part of visitor itineraries to northern \nEngland. However, despite its broader renown through the post-Roman period (Hingley \n2008; Hingley et al. in press), the Wall was slow to emerge as a tourist destination and as \na subject matter for visual representation.iii This is particularly clear when compared to the \nearly and prominent development of tourism in the Lake District. Indeed, Hadrian's Wall \nhad no special prominence in eighteenth and early nineteenth century topographical \nguidebooks to Northumberland and Cumberland which focused heavily on medieval \ncastles and ecclesiastical sites. The Romantic Movement did not find the same resonance \nin Hadrian\u201fs Wall \u2013 and the other monuments of Roman Britain \u2013 as it found in prehistoric \nmegaliths, medieval abbeys and Gothic castles. Although the Wall attracted a steady \nstream of visitors such as William Hutton and John Skinner both in 1801 (published 1802 \nand 1978 respectively), it was the efforts of John Collingwood Bruce which really \nestablished the Wall as a tourist destination. Through lectures and his illustrated Wallet \n 6 \nbook (1863, later renamed Handbook) Bruce defined the parameters of Hadrian\u201fs Wall as \na place to visit, by encouraging people to examine the monument and its landscape for \nthemselves and instructing them on the practicalities of their visit (Bruce 1886: 135). His \nambition to attract more visitors broadly coincided with the rise of leisure time as side-\neffect of industrialization and with the improvement of transport networks such as the \nconstruction of the Newcastle-Carlisle railway during the 1830s. Nonetheless, the Wall \nremained comparatively peripheral to the dominant nineteenth century topographical \ninterest in medieval castles and ecclesiastical sites, as well as a new fascination with \nengineering achievements such as the Newcastle-Carlisle railway itself (e.g. Blackmore & \nCarmichael 1836; Dobson 1857).  \nMany of the illustrations for Bruce\u201fs Handbook were based on original watercolours by the \nRichardson brothers and etched by F.W. Fairholt and C.J. Spence. The majority of the \nillustrations in the earlier editions of the Handbook (and Bruce\u201fs more comprehensive \nscholarly work, The Roman Wall, 1853) demonstrate a close visual focus on individual \narchaeological structures (e.g. gateways, buildings). In particular, many of these features \nare represented at the moment of their discovery. This visual motif draws upon the \nRomantic tradition of picturing ruined structures, half-concealed and half-exposed, framed \nby verdant vegetation (e.g. T.M. Richardson\u201fs Works at Heddon-on-the-Wall reproduced in \nBruce 1853: facing p.117). The frequent inclusion of a pair of human figures serves both to \nindicate the scale of the structures and to mediate between viewer and monument. \nSimultaneously, wild goats, sheep and cattle stress the untamed and pastoral environment \nof the Wall.  \nViews of the monument in its wider landscape context comprise a surprisingly small \npercentage of eighteenth and early nineteenth century images, especially compared to \ntheir dominance in public discourse today. Nonetheless, it is these views, such as William \nCollard\u201fs 1837 The Wall on the Nine Nicks of Thirwall (reproduced in Birley 1961: pl.3), \nand another view of the same stretch produced for Bruce\u201fs Roman Wall (1853: 231), which \nconstitute \u201epioneer images\u201f (Balm & Holcomb 2003: 159), that is, images which establish \nan iconic visual representation of the monument and its landscape and which have been \nheavily influential on subsequent image-making. These mural representations, which \nbecame dominant during the later nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, developed a \nclear \u201egeometry\u201f, using elevated viewpoints, diagonal leading lines and multiple horizons to \nvisualize and contain the Wall\u201fs structure (Fig. 2). These visual motifs focused particular \nemphasis on the opportunities afforded by the upstanding archaeology and dramatic \ntopography of the central stretches of the Wall. The subsequent continuity of these \n\u201epioneer images\u201f across different media, through painting and woodcuts to photography, is \ntypical of iconic representations of tourist and heritage sites (e.g. the Colosseum, \nSzegedy-Maszak 1992; Fig. 3).iv  \n \n 7 \nFigure 2. Hadrian\u2019s Wall near Hot Bank. Wood-cut by F.W. Fairchild (from Bruce 1895: \n164) \n \nFigure 3. Photographing an iconic view of Hadrian\u2019s Wall and Crag Lough near Milecastle \n39 (Castle Nick). (Photo: A. Hiley) \nToday, the iconic representation of the stone curtain wall rising and falling over the Whin \nSill crags has come to dominate the public discourse of Hadrian's Wall. By its very \nubiquity, this image shapes popular expectations and understanding (see below). \nHowever, other less prominent stretches of the Wall can demonstrate similarly long, if less \nwell-known, histories of depiction which illustrate other aspects of picturing practices. A \ngood example is provided by the fragment of stone curtain wall at Denton Bank \n(Newcastle-upon-Tyne). Hutton (1802) presents a square-on schematized view of the \ncurtain wall, topped by a \u201eheraldic-style\u201f apple tree, with no attempt to indicate its wider \nphysical setting; T.M. Richardson\u201fs version of the same scene in 1823 takes a more \nnaturalistic approach, with some token foreground vegetation; H.B. Richardson\u201fs c.1848-\n50 woodcut (from an original watercolour) depicts the wall and the now-dead apple tree \nbut puts equal emphasis on the surrounding landscape (Brewis 1927: plate 17, figs. 1-3; \nFigs. 4-6). Over time, the style of representation therefore evolves from diagrammatic to \nnaturalistic. Simultaneously, the visual frame expands to include more of the stone wall\u201fs \nsetting, grounding the structure in a landscape from which it draws ever more meaning. \nArguably, the framing of these increasingly wide vistas can be understood in the context of \nthe impact of economic and industrial development on the landscape of Victorian Britain, \nnot least in North-east England. Like much nineteenth century art, these images assert a \npre-industrial and rural world in the face of rapid urbanization and industrialization \n(Cosgrove 1984: 223-53). Indeed, Bruce (1853: 145-6) comments on the increased \nquarrying of the stone curtain wall at Denton Bank to repair the \u2013 notably unseen \u2013 \nhighway alongside the structure and notes \u201cIt [the wall] has lost a course of facing-stones \nsince Hutton saw it, and the apple tree is but the shadow of what it was\u201d. Arguably the real \nsubject matter of all three images is the apple tree; its demise as depicted by H.B. \nRichardson for Bruce\u201fs Roman Wall seems to resonate with the latter\u201fs concerns about the \nthreat of urban encroachment to the Wall\u201fs very survival. Today the site is surrounded by \nsuburban development but, under the ownership of the City of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, has \nbeen protected since 1924 (Fig. 7). As will be explored further below, this careful \nmanipulation of landscape context to directly or indirectly comment on the historical \ninterpretation or contemporary significance of the Wall is a recurrent theme running \nthroughout the visual history of the Wall.  \n \n 8 \nA \nB \nC \nD \nFigures 4-7.

However, these motifs can be actively reworked to create \nnew or more nuanced meanings. For example, the influential mid-twentieth century \nphotographer Bill Brandt provided the photographs to illustrate a Picture Post article The \nThreat to the Great Wall (Joad 1943). In the context of wartime Britain, both images and \ntext draw a loose parallel between Hadrian\u201fs Wall and the (English) national frontier; the \nformer threatened by quarrying and latter by Nazi Germany. The framing of many of these \nphotographs carefully echoes pioneer representations of the Wall, but Delany (2004: 198) \nsuggests that Brandt was consciously showing the familiar in unfamiliar ways, using \nturbulent clouds glowering above depopulated landscapes to evoke a bleak and \nthreatened atmosphere. Nearly twenty years later, one of the images, The Roman \nMilecastle, was reused in Brandt\u201fs Literary Britain (1951) to illustrate Kipling\u201fs novel Puck \nof Pook\u2019s Hill, which is partially set on the Wall. Closely cropped to focus on a small stretch \nof the Wall high above Crag Lough, the image reduces both monument and landscape to a \nbeautiful but stark chiaroscuro effect. In contrast with the \u201epioneer image\u201f of the assertive \nWall commanding infinite horizons, the scene is re-imagined as claustrophobic, embattled \nand foreboding. \nIt is informative to compare Brandt\u201fs work to more recent images of the Wall by (semi-) \nprofessional photographers such as Roger Clegg, Graham Peacock and Joan Thirlaway, \nwhich have been much used in marketing campaigns. These photographers draw on the \nsame motifs found in the \u201epioneer images\u201f, such as leading lines and multiple horizons, but \nproject a more expansive and contemplative space, evoking different emotions and \nmeanings. Clegg explicitly aspires to look again at a much photographed monument and \nto see something new and to capture its mood (Richards & Clegg 2008). In strong contrast \n 9 \nto the washed-out monochrome of earlier images (cf. Bergstr\u00f6m 1975), all three \nphotographers make particular use of light and (often saturated) colour to suggest a \nlandscape of hope (sunrise), reflection (sunset) and escape (solitude). This is not the \nthreatened and threatening landscape of Brandt; instead these images are designed to \nattract and invite. Nonetheless, this is still an unmistakably peripheral landscape, at the \nvery limit of Roman civilization and contemporary England alike. There is a greater \npresence of human figures, notably visitors (e.g. walkers) rather than locals (e.g. farmers), \nbut overall it is still portrayed as a thinly-populated and unspoilt landscape. These images \nsuggest that the Wall has survived because of its isolated location in a wild and remote \nplace; potential visitors are promised a direct and authentic encounter with the Roman \npast, untouched by the intervening centuries. Indeed, we are encouraged to believe that \ntoday\u201fs landscape has changed little since Roman times. Yet the cultural construction of \nthese dominant contemporary notions is clearly revealed when compared with Kipling\u201fs \nEdwardian vision of the Wall as a thriving linear town (quoted above), a place full of human \nlife, culture and diversity (for archaeological evidence for the Roman environment, see \nHuntley 1999). \nIn reality, both the physical environment and the fabric of the monument have been \ncontinually transformed during and since the Roman period (Witcher et al. 2010). The \nstone curtain wall has been extensively rebuilt several times both in antiquity and in the \nrecent past (e.g. conservation work, particularly during the nineteenth century; Woodside & \nCrow 1999). Today, the landscape is intensively managed (see Norman 2008 for a sense \nof the complexity of this task). \u201eDesire lines\u201f are mown in the grass-sward in order to limit \nerosion by subtly guiding visitors elsewhere; weedkiller suppresses vegetation which \nwould otherwise have long ago reclaimed stone structures; linesmen, rangers and \nvolunteers move along the Wall repairing damage and picking litter. Of course, visitors are \nnot na\u00efve and many will recognize this artifice and will be quite content with it; for example, \nPrentice & Anderson (2007) note that visitors to the Danish heritage attraction of Den \nGamle By are well aware of the inauthenticity of the ensemble of relocated buildings from \ndifferent periods and places, but they are quite happy to \u201eplay along\u201f (for more on visitors\u201f \nawareness of the branding of Hadrian's Wall, see Witcher in press). \nAll of these examples demonstrate that the visual representation of Hadrian\u201fs Wall \nencodes a tension between objective documentation and artistic licence. This is the same \nfor any heritage monument or tourist destination. However, in the case of the Wall, this \ntension is ill-concealed. Indeed, comments collated from the photo-questionnaire and \nphoto-sharing websites demonstrate a widely-shared ability and desire to distinguish \nbetween picture and place; that is, between the medium (photography) and the subject \n(Scott & Canter 1997). People are able to discern and express the ambiguity of images as \nboth documents of record and as resources for emotive responses, and to reflect on how \nthis constructs understanding of both the (Roman) past and the present landscape. It will \nbe argued below (and in Witcher in press) that Hadrian\u201fs Wall therefore provides a \npowerful example from which to develop the idea of enabling visitors to read the landscape \nand to reflect on the cultural construction of imagery and the past it represents. \n4. Picturing the Landscape \nThe aspect of the country in the immediate vicinity of the heights of Sewingshields is dreary enough, but the \nelevation enables the eye to revel in the fertility and beauty of the distant landscape. (Bruce The Roman Wall \n1853 Second edition) \nAbove, it has been suggested that pioneer images of Hadrian\u201fs Wall have established a \nparticular geometry which implicates the landscape setting of the monument as a central \npart of the monument\u201fs visual representation and meaning. The physical scale of the Wall \n\u2013 and other linear monuments such as roads and aqueducts \u2013 means that it can only ever \n 10 \nbe experienced partially; it can never be experienced instantaneously in its entirety (Sam \nSmiles pers. comm.). It is therefore always a composite of separate encounters under \ndifferent meteorological conditions, during different seasons and in different company.v In \nsuch a situation, representations of linear monuments take on added responsibilities. Very \noften they must stand pars in toto, communicating wider truths through the representation \nof fragments. In this context, it is easy to see how representations of the Wall\u201fs central \nsector \u2013 with its dramatic geological sub-structure (Figs. 2 & 8) \u2013 have become shorthand \nfor the Wall as a whole, even though this distinctive topographical setting and the curtain \nwall\u201fs structural responses to it are hardly typical of the frontier as a whole. The unspoken \nnecessity of Wall photographs to communicate unseen \u201ewholes\u201f may require the use of \nvisual clich\u00e9s which effect quite specific meanings. For example, Manghani (2008) notes \nthat photography of the Berlin Wall prioritized stretches cutting through urban streets even \nthough most of the structure ran through open agricultural landscapes, and that this has \nshaped a specific reading of the structure\u201fs purpose and meaning. Similarly, the visual \nbias to the central upland sector of Hadrian\u201fs Wall may be deceptive because both the \noriginal significance and contemporary experience of the monument in this area are likely \nto differ significantly from the more extensive low-lying stretches of the Wall to the east \nand west. \n   \nFigure 8. Section of Hadrian\u2019s Wall west of Housesteads fort consolidated by John Clayton \nduring the nineteenth century (Photo: author). \nThe fundamental importance of landscape context in the representation and meaning of \nlinear monuments is revealed by the observation that whilst it is possible to distil the visual \nessence of WHSs such as Stonehenge, the Pyramids or the Taj Mahal without their \nlandscape context (no matter how integral that landscape was to their original raison \nd\u2019etre), it is almost impossible to visualize Hadrian\u201fs Wall and other linear Roman \nmonuments such as the Pont du Gard (France) similarly deprived of the shapes and \ncolours of their landscape setting.vi The repetition of basic architectural forms means that \none stretch can look much like another, so specific locality and meaning must be signalled \nby the representation of linear structures\u201f physical settings.vii Hence the landscape \n\u201ebackground\u201f in mural imagery carries particularly heavy responsibility for intended or \npossible meanings. Further, because these landscapes are often chronologically dissonant \nwith the monument they surround (e.g. a Roman frontier wall in a largely nineteenth \ncentury landscape), there is scope for those meanings to be ambiguous or misleading: did \nRoman soldiers garrison a landscape similar to the one we see today or not? \n 11 \nFinally, monument and landscape are not only co-represented, but also are frequently \nelided. Both visual and textual representations of Hadrian\u201fs Wall effect a merging of \nCulture and Nature. With particular reference to the Whin Sill crags of the central sector, \nthe Wall sits on top of the outcropping rock rising vertically from the solid geology \u2013 the \nmonument and landscape are physically and conceptually merged.viii Statements such as \nthe \u201enatural north-facing rampart of the Whin Sill\u201f (Pickett et al. 2006: 38) may even be \nread as implicitly political \u2013 the Wall\u201fs presence was predestined, a natural limit has been \nreached, the Roman frontier simply confirms the natural order. An alternative take on the \nCulture-Nature divide is suggested by the lichens which have colonized the stonework and \nthe verdant turf-cap which protects those sections of the Wall conserved by John Clayton \nduring the nineteenth century (Fig. 8). Here Nature seems to reclaim the hubristic \nmonument of a past civilization and invites contemplation on ruination and the fall of \nempire (e.g. Bruce 1853; see Hingley 2000). \n5. Other Modes of Representation \nAnd, while I travel the long and dreary Wall, would have you travel with me, though by your own fireside; \nwould have you see, and feel, as I do; and make the journey influence your passions, as mine are \ninfluenced. (Hutton The History of the Roman Wall 1802) \nSo far, this paper has focused on paintings and photographs of the monument. However, \nthere are other forms of representation which exert powerful influence on popular \nunderstanding of the Wall. First, a specific category of representation is reconstruction of \nthe Wall as it was \u201ein the days of the Romans\u201f (Graham 1988). This includes two-\ndimensional images and three-dimensional models. The former can be traced back to the \nnineteenth century and include G.B. Richardson\u201fs (1851) view of Pons Aelii (Newcastle), \nBell Scott\u201fs (1857) fresco Construction of the Roman Wall at Wallington Hall and R.J.S. \nBertram\u201fs (1923) The Emperor Hadrian\u2019s Visit to Pons Aelii (now Newcastle) AD 122. \nMore recent reconstructions include the rain-lashed imagery of Alan Sorrell (Pitts 2005) \nand the prolific and influential work of Ronald Embleton (e.g. illustrations in Graham 1988; \nfor Embleton\u201fs famous Housesteads Latrine, see Witcher in press). Scale models and full-\nsize reconstructions have also been powerful and popular ways of representing the Wall \nincluding the 12.5m long model of the Wall in the former Museum of Antiquities (Smith \n1959) and a number of full-size reconstructions at Vindolanda, South Shields and \nWallsend (Birley 2009: 36-7; Witcher in press; Fig. 9). In each case, visual and physical \nreconstruction blends extant traces of the Wall with archaeological and iconographical \nevidence from around the wider Roman Empire in order to re-imagine and re-materialize \nthe Wall for a variety of political motives from association with imperial glory through to \neconomic regeneration in the post-industrial city (see Hingley et al. in press). \n \nFigure 9. Reconstruction of stone curtain of Hadrian\u2019s Wall at Wallsend, with original \nRoman foundations in foreground. (Photo: author) \nA second category of representation is cartography. The massive scale of the monument \nmakes cartography an obvious mode of representation; maps can reduce the Wall\u201fs size \nand complexity to a level which can be more easily apprehended. The Wall has appeared \n 12 \non maps for centuries, not least because of its proximity to the English-Scottish border \n(Shannon 2007). The Roman frontier was of great political significance during the \nmedieval and early modern eras, both symbolically and even as a potential military line. \nThe renewed strategic significance of the Wall\u201fs route in the aftermath of the Jacobite \nRebellion led to extensive mapping surveys of enormous significance for scholarly and \npopular awareness of the monument and its political and cultural value (Hingley 2008: \n134-8). The Wall continues to be a privileged feature in contemporary cartography. As well \nas its own dedicated mapping (e.g. AMHW 2010), it frequently appears in road atlases \nwhich lack any indication of other ancient monuments. Its great length and cultural \nprominence merits special treatment. The route of the Wall also appears on the Ordnance \nSurvey maps which frequently travel with walkers along the Hadrian\u201fs Wall Trail. These \nmaps form an important and highly visible item of equipment for Wall-walkers (generally, \nsee Edensor 2000); like photography, cartography can be a fundamentally embodied form \nof representation. In discussion, one National Park Ranger questioned the purpose of \nthese maps: \u201cit\u201fs hard to get lost on the Hadrian\u201fs Wall Trail\u201d. But arguably the significance \nof these walking maps is less about wayfinding and more about monitoring progress along \nthe monument. As noted above, the monument is too large to experience at a glance and \none stretch of wall can look much like another; walkers do not need maps to find the Wall, \nthey need maps to find themselves on the Wall, to position themselves in relation to the \nmonument as a whole.  \nAnother category of representation is literature and poetry. The present paper focuses on \nvisual imagery but arguably two of the most well-known representations of the Wall during \nthe early twentieth century were textual: Kipling\u201fs (1906) Puck of Pook\u2019s Hill and W.H. \nAuden\u201fs Roman Wall Blues (for other literary material, see Chettle 2006; Hingley 2010). \nMore generally, a number of novels have taken the Wall and its military garrison as the \nbasis for plotlines (e.g. Dietrich 2005; Sutcliff 1954). The Wall has also provided inspiration \nfor travel writers. There is a long tradition of narrating Wall journeys including Hutton \n(1802), Mothersole (1922) and Davies (2009). In each case, the Wall provides a spatial \nsequence to structure texts which are as equally concerned with the contemporary world \nas with the Roman monument. The opening of the National Trail in 2003 has inspired a \nrecent proliferation of Wall travelogues (e.g. Bibby 2006; Mortimer 2007).  \nThe fourth and final category of representation is television and film. The Wall and its \nlandscape have made many screen appearances, but arguably the single most influential \nrepresentation in the last twenty years is the short sequence in the Hollywood film Robin \nHood Prince of Thieves (1991). This film has helped to establish Sycamore Gap as the \nmost photographed section of Wall (see Crang 2003 for layering of cultural references in \nthe creation of destinations; Beeton 2005 and Tooke & Baker 1996 on \u201efilm-induced\u201f \ntourism; Fig. 10). No historical or folkloric tradition associates Robin Hood with the Wall or \nwith this specific locality. Indeed, the film\u201fs narrative implies that the scene is set between \nDover and London and the plot does not directly allude to the Wall itself. Rather it simply \nuses the location for its scenic qualities. Subsequently, however, Sycamore Gap and \nRobin Hood have become closely intertwined in the popular imagination (note the \npresence of Robin, Hood, Prince and Thieves in the participant responses, Fig. 1). Many \nvisitors appear to retain direct awareness of the cinematic origin of this association and \nsome find knowing amusement in Hollywood\u201fs rearrangement of British geography. \nVisiting and photographing \u201eRobin Hood\u201fs tree\u201f is now a central part of many people\u201fs visit \nto Hadrian\u201fs Wall. \n 13 \n \nFigure 10. Sycamore Gap viewed from the north. The stone curtain wall runs along the top \nof the crags. (Photo: author) \n6. Re-presenting the Wall \nThe woodcuts and plates, illustrative of the antiquities found on the line, have...been prepared from original \ndrawings...from the objects themselves. I am not without hope that the well-read antiquary will value these \ndelineations for their beauty and accuracy. (Bruce The Roman Wall, 1853 Second edition) \nEarlier sections have considered some of the history of the imagery of Hadrian\u201fs Wall. This \nsection turns to the way in which contemporary visitors represent the Wall and its \nlandscape through the embodied practice of photography. Visitors\u201f understanding and \nbehaviour is shaped by the circulation of imagery and ideas. In particular, scholars of \ntourism have observed how visitors reproduce iconic destination images in their own \nphotographic practices. This process has been described as \u201eclosing the hermeneutic \ncircle\u201f; prior exposure to imagery frames places in particular ways and this creates specific \nexpectations about a place which then forms the metric by which subsequent experiences \nof that place are judged (Caton & Santos 2008; Crang 2003; Hunter 2008). By this \ninterpretation, tourists travel to reaffirm prior expectations, often rationalized as \n\u201eauthenticity\u201f and documented through photography.ix However, Edensor (2001) has \nquestioned this interpretation, arguing that visitors are capable of resisting such \u201escripting\u201f \nthrough playful and knowing reworking of these expectations. \nTo understand the ways in which modern day visitors document their encounters with \nHadrian\u201fs Wall, this section focuses on the enormous resource provided by photo-sharing \nwebsites. These images are considered for three reasons: firstly, Ewin\u201fs (2000) cultural \nhistory of Hadrian\u201fs Wall, which includes some consideration of visual imagery, predates \nthe rapid rise of photo-sharing websites and digital photography \u2013 the nature of image \nproduction and circulation has profoundly changed over the subsequent decade. \nSecondly, the World Wide Web now forms one of the public\u201fs most important sources of \n(visual) information about the Wall; thirdly, the World Wide Web provides an enormous \nuntapped collection of images, captured and annotated by visitors independently of the \nrestrictions and distortions of traditional academic or consultation exercises (see Murthy \n2008; Pink 2008). \nPhotographic images are mnemonic devices to connect people with a sense of past \nexperience (Crang 2006). In other words, it is the narration of objects and images which is \nimportant, not the objects per se. In this sense, the \u201etags\u201f and comments attached to \nimages shared online are equally if not more important than the images themselves. \nThese provide a commentary on the interpretations and values read into and out of these \nimages. \nVisitors to Hadrian\u201fs Wall have clear ideas about what they expect to see and experience. \nThese expectations are shaped by a highly selective set of iconic images which prioritize \ncertain aspects of the Wall and its landscape (Fig. 8). In turn such images exist within a \nwider visual economy, for example in relation to images of the Great Wall of China.x It is \n 14 \nagainst such specific preconceptions that visitors judge their experiences. The effects are \nstraightforward to trace. For example, some walkers on the National Trail speak of \ndisappointment at the lack of tangible traces of the Wall for the first 40 kilometres west of \nWallsend and then delight at \u201efinally reaching\u201f Hadrian\u201fs Wall in the central upland sector.  \nSuch responses encode two issues which both affect and reflect understanding: the \nlandscape context and the materiality of the monument. Firstly, on the basis of the \ncirculation of imagery, there is a general expectation that Hadrian\u201fs Wall is located in a \nrural landscape. This resonates with the impression of the Wall as a frontier, on the edge \nof civilization (i.e. the Roman Empire) or the nation state (as noted above Hadrian\u201fs Wall \nand the English\/Scottish border are often conflated). It is clearly easier to imagine the rural \nlandscape of northern England as the authentic context of the Wall, than the modern urban \nsprawl of Tyneside and Carlisle.  \nSecondly, the materiality of the Wall has a profound effect on representation and \ninterpretation. The visualization of Hadrian\u201fs Wall is heavily dependent on just one \ncomponent part of this complex archaeological monument \u2013 i.e. the stone curtain wall. An \nimportant reason that Hadrian\u201fs Wall could be created as a visitor destination through a set \nof iconic images is because of its inherent imageability \u2013 \u201cthat quality in a physical object \nwhich gives it a high probability of evoking a strong image in any given observer\u201d (Lynch \n1960: 9). As all archaeologists know, earthworks are hard to comprehend from ground \nlevel, making them difficult to photograph. Even the most well-preserved and striking \nsections of the Vallum, the immense linear earthwork to the rear of the stone curtain wall, \nlacks obvious visual impact (Fig. 11).xi However, the very imageability of the stone curtain \nwall creates a self-reinforcing myth about the nature and significance of the monument as \na whole. \n \nFigure 11.The vallum east of Housesteads fort. Wood-cut by F.W. Fairchild (from Bruce \n1895: 137). \nThere is much more to Hadrian\u201fs Wall than the stone curtain wall. But if the authenticity of \na visit to the Wall is measured against the metric of these iconic images, appreciation of \nthe complexity of the broader monument is obscured.  By focussing almost exclusively on \nthe stone curtain wall, of which less than 2.5% of the original structure is visible (Bidwell & \nHill 2009: table 3) \u2013 and that heavily biased to the central upland section \u2013 then \nexpectations are narrowed and visitors concentrated at a few \u201ehoney-pot\u201f sites which are \nnot fully representative of the frontier as a whole. This creates practical management \nproblems (e.g. parking, Guiver et al. 2006) but also reinforces particular understandings of \nthe Wall\u201fs function and significance. As noted above, if visitors all head to the central \nsections where the stone curtain wall is best preserved and the landscape setting is most \ndramatic, particular readings of the Wall\u201fs function may be reinforced (see also Witcher in \n 15 \npress). These perceptions may not be wrong, but they may comprise only a select subset \nof possibilities. \nThis is the predicament in which Hadrian\u201fs Wall Heritage Limited (HWHL)xii finds itself. It is \ncharged with increasing visitor numbers, but needs to spread these across under-visited \nsections of the Wall in order to facilitate economic regeneration. In developing a strategy, \nHWHL is compelled to build on public discourse; its brand must resonate to some degree \nwith existing perceptions (e.g. the \u201ePlan Your Invasion\u201f publicity campaign, 2007). \nHowever, the resulting emphasis on images of the stone curtain wall, forms the metric \nagainst which visits are then measured. If a stone wall is central to the brand, then its \nabsence presents a problem. It becomes more difficult to convince visitors that Hadrian\u201fs \nWall is more than simply a stone wall in an upland rural setting \u2013 it can, for example, be \nfound in urban, estuarine and coastal landscapes, dismantled and reworked into early \nChristian monuments, or reduced to a slight earthwork alongside a road. If the \nmonument\u201fs perceived identity is restricted to the stone curtain wall, it is harder to \nconvince people that Hadrian\u201fs Wall is more complex and that it can be in other places too.  \nIn recent work, scholars of tourism have focused on the way in which visitors take \nphotographs which reproduce the iconic views which drew them to the destination in the \nfirst place (Caton & Santos 2008). However, visitor photographs of the Wall are not \ncompletely determined by such views (Edensor 2001). A striking trend, well-documented \nthrough user-generated photographs shared online, is the inclusion of street furniture and \npublic art which names or alludes to the Wall. References to the Wall have long been \nfound around its wider landscape, most obviously in place names (Whitworth 2000), street \nnames (generally, Azaryahu 1996) and the names of business (e.g. Hadrian Paints at \nHaltwhistle). Along the route of the Wall, there has been a long-term trend for \u201eRomanizing\u201f \nthe names of pubs, restaurants and guesthouses (e.g. the Milecastle Inn at Cawfields, \nformerly the Common House). Over the past 15 years, this trend has accelerated markedly \nleading to a new prominence of \u201eRoman-ness\u201f in the landscape. There is a particular \nconcentration in areas of urban regeneration such as Wallsend (e.g. Hadrian Mews), \nByker (e.g. Hadrian Square) and Haltwhistle (e.g. Hadrian Business Park). More generally, \nthe opening of the National Trail in 2003 has led to a significant re-presencing of the Wall \nthrough street furniture and art installations, both on the route of the Wall itself, and in new \nareas where the Trail and Wall diverge (e.g. Newcastle Quayside; Witcher et al. 2010).  \nThe inclusion of these signs and artworks in visitors\u201f photographs, either as the principal \nsubject matter or as a backdrop to individual and group portraits, is striking. These \nphotographs may have an obvious humorous motive: the visual irony of a sign for \nHadrian\u201fs Wall affixed to a stone wall. Another explanation is that, as the Trail encourages \nexploration beyond the best-preserved sections, especially in urban areas where the Trail \ndeviates from the line of the Wall altogether, these signs become a substitute. Tourist \ndestinations are framed by a proliferation of markers which serve to make the original \nplace real and authentic; indeed, the signifier may become more important than the \nsignified (Crang 1997: 361; 2006). One definition of tourism is therefore travelling to see \nthe signs (in this case, literally signposts) which authenticate experience. Visitors may \ntravel to actual destinations to experience virtual places (Crang 2003; Kirshenblatt-\nGimblett 1998: 169-71). Without a visible stone wall, signs are a guarantee to both \nphotographer and audience back home that the visitor really was \u201eon the Wall\u201f.  \nThe importance of these signs and substitutes is that they demonstrate that it is possible to \ncommemorate or rematerialize the Wall both on its former course and \u2013 importantly \u2013 \nelsewhere as well. Such mobility and elasticity of the concept of the Wall is vitally \nimportant for the goals of HWHL. This agency has the stated intention to develop a more \nexpansive vision of the Wall \u2013 both in terms of geographical extent (e.g. spreading visitors \nto new areas) and in terms of broadening associations beyond the Roman period and \n 16 \nmilitary archaeology (e.g. the Border Reivers; HWMP 2008). One possible way to assess \nthe future success of such an exercise, and the effectiveness of other similar heritage \nmarketing brands, is to map user-generated content. For example, the geograph.org.uk \nwebsite aims to collect visually representative photographs for every square kilometre in \nthe UK. Taking the route of the Hadrian\u201fs Wall Trail, Figure 12 plots the numbers of \nimages which depict the Wall or are \u201etagged\u201f with associated terms, in comparison with all \nother photographs. This demonstrates that currently Hadrian\u201fs Wall still has a rather \ndiscontinuous presence. The Wall dominates perceptions of the landscape in the central \nupland area, but is much less prominent in the lowland and urban landscapes to the east \nand west. It is perhaps too soon to judge whether HWHL has achieved its objectives in \nterms of transforming perceptions, but it would seem that the analysis of online user-\ngenerated materials could be a sensitive \u2013 and cost-effective \u2013 barometer of public \nawareness.  \n \nFigure 12. Distribution of photographs tagged as \u2018Hadrian\u2019s Wall\u2019 or related terms along \nthe course of the National Trail based on data from geograph.org.uk (n=1951). The \nsymbols indicate the relative number of photographs per kilometre grid square which \ndocument or allude to Hadrian\u2019s Wall (dark grey) and all other photographs (pale grey). \nFinally, alongside photographs of iconic views and signs, are photographs of people \u2013 the \nvisitors themselves. It is easy to allow embodied experience to slip away from discussion \nof image-making practices. However, it is important to retain a focus on the multisensory \nand embodied status of both photographer and the photographed. Focusing on \nphotography might be expected to give primacy to sight at the expense of other senses \nwhich may be more difficult to visualize. However, analysis of online images demonstrates \nthat a broader range of senses is not only represented, but that these are important for the \nexperience of the monument and the articulation of those experiences.  \nAfter vision, the most obvious sense to be represented is touch (see Crang 2003). Whilst \nthere are plenty of images of visitors standing in front of the monument \u2013 the Wall-as-\nscenery \u2013 many photographs document direct physical contact. These include people \nsitting on, standing on, propping up, and jumping off the Wall. The representation of these \nhaptic encounters suggests that for many visitors it is not enough simply to be pictured \nwith the Wall, there is a need to experience it physically. Its scale and antiquity invite and \ndemand a more intense and direct encounter than that offered by sight alone. Some \nvisitors recount the liberating contrast with the closely monitored environment of a \nmuseum and perhaps having already \u201eseen\u201f the Wall many times prior to visiting, touch is \nan important way for visitors to affirm the Wall\u201fs authenticity. The institutions which \nmanage the Wall actively discourage visitors from climbing and walking on the monument \nin order to protect the archaeology, but the importance and immediacy of touch to visitor \nencounter is recognized, for example, though the \u201eTouching the Wall\u201f workshop run by a \nlocal heritage education group (Tyne Team 2009). Finally, it is useful to remember that the \nsenses cannot be arbitrarily divided: most obviously, visitors stand on the Wall in order to \nsee get a better view or to frame a photograph. \nN0 10 20 30 40km\nSouth Tyne\nNorth Tyne\nEden\nEsk\nSolway\nFirth\nNorth \nSea\nCarlisle\nNewcastle \nupon Tyne\n 17 \n7. Conclusions \nHadrian\u201fs Wall is one of the most well-known and well-researched archaeological \nmonuments of the Roman Empire. Like many other World Heritage Sites, the modern \nhistory of the site is closely linked to image-making and visiting practices, and to the \nrecursive relationship between them. Academia has traditionally privileged text over \nimagery but it is clear that visual representations exert strong and defining influence on the \nperception of landscapes and monuments. Similarly, Web 2.0 and digital media open new \nopportunities for people to engage with virtual places and tourist destinations, and new \nchallenges for academics to develop methods to assess these developments. For \nexample, user-generated content signals a breakdown of traditional categories of \nrepresentational analysis such as professional\/popular and producer\/consumer, requiring \nnew conceptual approaches; similarly, it will demand new methods to document and \nanalyze these vast and constantly-changing datasets.   \nBy looking at the historical context of representations of Hadrian\u201fs Wall, it is possible to \ntrace the emergence of a series of iconic images. Whilst earlier imagery focused on short \nstretches of Wall and moments of discovery, by the mid nineteenth century a set of iconic \nmural images had been defined. These images increasingly incorporated the physical \nsetting of the monument within the frame of view and these contextual landscapes have \ncome to sustain particular readings of the Wall\u201fs function and significance, for example, as \ninevitable and peripheral. Such images structure expectations about the Wall and, since at \nleast the eighteenth century, visitors have sought to verify these representations during \ntheir own visits and subsequently to reproduce them. Notably, despite the changes in \ntechnological medium, there is strong continuity in contemporary visitor image-making \npractices. Whilst it is possible to discern some innovations in visitor photography, most \nnotably the inclusion of National Trail street furniture, the bulk of images continue to \nrework a small set of pioneer images which emphasize a basic grammar of leading lines \nand multiple horizons, and evoke a wild and depopulated frontier landscape. \nThis situation will be considered further in the second part of this study (Witcher in press). \nSpecifically, it will assess the possibility that New Media can stifle as well as diversify \nrepresentations of heritage sites and landscapes. This will form part of a broader analysis \nof the influence of the New Media on the nexus between representation and encounter. To \nbalance the emphasis on representation in the current paper, the second part of this study \nwill focus on physical encounters with the Wall. In particular, it will consider the way in \nwhich movement around the monument and its landscape explicitly and implicitly \nstructures visitors\u201f understanding of the Roman past through a process of embodied \nempathy. It will go on to consider some alternative approaches taking inspiration from \nvirtual communities, such as geocachers, to enable the creation of new modes of \nrepresentation and encounter.  \nAcknowledgments \nThis research stems from the AHRC-funded project, Tales of the Frontier.

The famous stone \nwall which forms just one component of this wider system is distinguished here as the \u201estone curtain wall\u201f.  \nii\n This paper derives from a larger collaborative research project, Tales of the Frontier, which has explored \nthe post-Roman history and reception of Hadrian\u201fs Wall and its landscape from a variety of perspectives. For \nother results from the project, see inter alia: Hingley (2010); Hingley et al. (in press); Nesbitt & Tolia-Kelly \n(2009); Witcher et al. (2010). \niii\n The prolific engraver Thomas Bewick (1753-1828) was born and lived for many years only a few miles \nsouth of Hadrian\u201fs Wall at Cherryburn, yet not a single image of the Wall has been found amongst the many \nthousands he produced. Notably, his personal library included a copy of Hutton\u201fs (1802) History of the \nRoman Wall (Gardner\u2013Medwin 2009). \niv\n Despite the deployment of photography during the mid nineteenth century at classical sites around the \nMediterranean such as Rome, Paestum and Athens (Lyons et al. 2005) \u2013 and Stonehenge in Britain \n(Chippendale 2004) \u2013 the technology came late to Hadrian\u201fs Wall. Bruce\u201fs Handbook was generously \nillustrated with woodcuts from the first edition, but photography did not appear until the 1885 third edition (a \nsingle portrait); a photographic view of the Wall did not appear until the fourth edition in 1895. \nv\n In this context, Davies\u201f introduction to a reprint of his 1974 bestseller A Walk along the Wall notes \u201cI could \nof course have walked the Wall in its entirety once again, but that would have produced a new book\u201d (Davies \n2009: xi). \n \nvi\n The impossibility of experiencing cities in their entirety has similarly led to distinctive styles of urban \nrepresentation, most obviously aerial or cartographical views, e.g. Rome, see papers in Haselberger & \nHumprey 2006. \nvii\n For the architectural rhetoric of Hadrian\u201fs Wall as a Roman \u201edesign feature\u201f, see Hartis (2010). \nviii\n See Welfare (2004) for observations on the way in which Roman engineers may have enhanced the \nnatural rock in order create either visual and\/or strategic effect. \nix Warburton (1753) produced a small pocket companion \u201cfor such learned travellers and others whose \ncuriosity may lead them to visit the superb remains of the famous Picts Wall [i.e. Hadrian\u201fs Wall]\u201d. Birley \n(1961: 18) notes that Warburton\u201fs book encouraged comparison between the copperplate illustrations and \ndescriptions of Roman altarstones and the original objects. Visiting the Wall as a means of verifying visual \nand textual representations has therefore occurred since at least the eighteenth century. \nx\n Comparison with the Great Wall of China has a long heritage. Hodgson\u201fs (1840) work on Hadrian\u201fs Wall \nincluded images of both walls. \nxi\n Generally, artists and photographers have found it challenging to depict ancient earthworks, at least from \nground level. In this context, we might note the lack of any truly iconic representations of the Antonine Wall in \nScotland (another Roman frontier which briefly replaced Hadrian\u201fs Wall in the mid second century AD) or of \nOffa\u201fs Dyke (the early medieval earthwork which bounded the Kingdom of Mercia), though in both of these \ncases, there may be specific political reasons for the relative lack of attention when compared with Hadrian\u201fs \nWall. In contrast to linear earthworks, prehistoric barrows (e.g. Silbury Hill) and hillforts (e.g. Maiden Castle) \nare more amenable to representation (I thank Sam Smiles for the latter point). \nxii\n Hadrian\u201fs Wall Heritage Limited is a not-for-profit company, part-funded by the One NE and North West \nRegional Development Agencies, to co-ordinate the activities of the many institutions involved in the \nmanagement of the World Heritage Site. It also manages initiatives intended to develop the local economy, \nfor example, through the promotion of tourism. \n"}
