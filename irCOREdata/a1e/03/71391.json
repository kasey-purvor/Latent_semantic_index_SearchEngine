(This author, however, makes no claim\nwhatsoever to represent the views of the other authors of Quirk et al.) Particular attention\nis paid to some of the more controversial aspects of Huddleston & Pullum\u2019s analysis. It is\nargued that the two grammars, although similar in their comprehensively wide coverage\nof English, are not strictly comparable, in that Huddleston & Pullum\u2019s grammar is more\ntheory-oriented and Quirk et al.\u2019s grammar is more observation-oriented. These different\norientations go with different strengths and weaknesses. In some areas Huddleston &\nPullum\u2019s more up-to-date account has manifest advantages over that of Quirk et al., but\nthere are also arguably areas where Huddleston & Pullum have not moved with the times.\n1 Preliminaries\nEvery so often, there appears a book which is important enough to fill the reviewer\nwith something like awe. Such a book may be a brilliant ground-breaking book such\nas Chomsky\u2019s Syntactic Structures. A different but no less awesome production is\nthe present book, whose strength lies more in being a consolidation and synthesis of\nexisting linguistic theory and description. But to suggest that The Cambridge Grammar\nof the English Language is backward-looking in any sense is misleading, as it also\ncontains a great deal that is new, if not daringly provocative, in its reworking of the\nwell-tilled territory of English grammar. The depth and richness of detail, as well\nas the breadth of coverage, are extraordinarily impressive, so that there is scarcely a\ntopic that grammatical old-timers like myself cannot read without fresh insight and\nunderstanding.\nWhat first of all attracts notice is the work\u2019s massive scale and comprehensive\ncoverage. Whoever thought Quirk et al.\u2019s A Comprehensive Grammar of the English\nLanguage (1985) contained the whole of English grammar within a single pair of covers\n1 In writing this review article, I have gratefully received comments and corrections from Bas Aarts, Costas\nGabrielatos, Magnus Levin, Joybrato Mukherjee, and Randolph Quirk.\n122 G E O F F R E Y L E E C H\nwill have to think again. This tome has 1,842 pages compared with 1,779 in Quirk et al.,\nand its information is typographically more densely packed page by page. After some\nrough-and-ready calculations, I reckoned that theCambridgeGrammar, with c. 890,000\nwords, would not be far short of the length of Jespersen\u2019s seven-volume A Modern\nEnglish Grammar on Historical Principles, if Jespersen\u2019s first volume on phonetics and\nspelling (topics largely excluded from the Cambridge Grammar) were disregarded.\nSecondly, consider the authorship and provenance of the book. Whereas Quirk et al.\nwere a compact authorial team of four, as many as fifteen names appear on the title page\nof the Cambridge Grammar, those of the two authors (both, interestingly, expatriate\nEnglishmen) and of thirteen collaborators, most of whom co-authored one or more\nchapters: Laurie Bauer, Betty Birner, Ted Briscoe, Peter Collins, David Denison, David\nLee, Anita Mittwoch, Geoffrey Nunberg, Frank Palmer, John Payne, Peter Peterson,\nLesley Stirling, and Gregory Ward. This distinguished authorial team has also greater\ngeographical spread than the Quirk et al. \u2018gang of four\u2019: it includes representatives\nfrom Australia, Israel, and New Zealand, in addition to the UK and the USA. However,\nunquestionably the chief architect and leading author of the book is Rodney Huddleston,\nwho is named as sole author of seven chapters, and joint author of the remaining thirteen\nchapters.\nThe gestation period has matched the size of the book. Intriguingly, the book\u2019s CUP\nwebpages inform us that Huddleston conceived its writing soon after publishing his\nreview in Language of Quirk et al. in 1988 (with Pullum joining later in 1995). This\ntogether with a handsome acknowledgement of Quirk et al. in the Preface2 perhaps\nwarrants angling this review article to the comparison of the two grammars. As one of\nthe authors of Quirk et al., I will avoid looking at the work entirely through Quirkian\nspectacles, but cannot refrain, at this initial stage, from a petty complaint: the title of\nthis book reduces acronymically to CGEL, which happens also to be the established\nabbreviation for A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language \u2013 as used, among\nmany others, by Huddleston in his 1988 review of that book. Perhaps time will find\na solution to this difficulty, but meanwhile, for the purposes of this article, I will use\nH&P as an abbreviation for the Cambridge Grammar and Q et al. as the abbreviation\nfor the Comprehensive Grammar.\nConsidering the many authors of this book, one might expect it to be stylistically\nuneven and lacking in intellectual coherence. On both these scores, however, the work\nachieves admirable consistency. It is also consistently well written, so that, in spite of\nthe density of information and argument, it achieves a reasonable standard of clarity\nand accessibility throughout. On the book\u2019s readability, one reservation I have, which\nwill need discussion later (in section 10), is the authors\u2019 profligacy in introducing\nunfamiliar terminology or unfamiliar uses of existing terminology.\n2 \u2018Special mention should be made . . . of the work of Randolph Quirk and his colleagues . . . Although the\npresent work often pursues a very different theoretical approach and analysis from that of Quirk et al., their\ngrammar proved an indispensable source of data and ideas\u2019 (p. xvi).\nA N E W G R AY \u2019 S A NATO M Y O F E N G L I S H G R A M M A R 123\nThirdly, let\u2019s turn to the content and organization of the book. Its twenty chapters\ncorrespond fairly closely to the eighteen chapters plus three appendices of Q et al.,\nchapters 19 and 20 corresponding to appendices I and III (on word formation and\npunctuation respectively in Q et al.). Apart from chapter 12 of Q et al., on \u2018Pro-forms\nand ellipsis\u2019, whose contents are dispersed in H&P, appendix II, on stress, rhythm, and\nintonation, is the only significant area of Q et al. without counterpart coverage in H&P.\nHowever, the spread of the material in the remaining chapters and appendices is by\nno means identical, as table 1 shows. The book ends with a Further Reading section\n(containing a short bibliography) and two indexes: a lexical index and a conceptual\nindex.\nTable 1.

Punctuation Appendix III: Punctuation\nTable 1 cannot be taken, of course, as a guide to the extent to which particular\ntopics are covered in the two grammars. For example, although the noun phrase seems\n124 G E O F F R E Y L E E C H\nto be covered by H&P in only one chapter (chapter 5), compared with three in Q\net al., this chapter 5 is a book in itself \u2013 a mega-chapter of 202 pages. A similar obser-\nvation can be made about the treatment of the verb: the single verb chapter, chapter 3,\nroughly equates with both chapters 3 and 4 of Q et al., and its 142 pages are comparable\nto both those chapters rolled into one (bearing in mind also that the treatment of irregular\nverbs is postponed in H&P to chapter 18 on inflectional morphology). Among areas\nof grammar dealt with in much more depth and detail in H&P should be mentioned\ncomparative constructions and negation (each accorded a separate chapter). Other\ngrammatical topics developed in depth in H&P \u2013 but not in Q et al. \u2013 include unbounded\ndependencies in chapter 12 (curiously called \u2018pushdown elements\u2019 in Q et al., and\nhandled in a somewhat fragmentary way). A further addition in the analytic apparatus\nof H&P is supplementation, supplements being \u2018elements . . . which are not integrated\ninto the structure of a sentence\u2019 (p.1350) being set off by a prosodic break in speech,\nor normally by punctuation marks in writing. Supplements include parenthetical main\nclauses, nonrestrictive relative clauses, and nonrestrictive apposition.\nWhile noting ways in which H&P go beyond Q et al., I should mention some other\nareas \u2013 e.g. the passive \u2013 which are less satisfactorily dealt with. I should also mention\nthe extent to which H&P make use of the apparatus of logic and Gricean pragmatics\n(tense logic, entailment, conversational implicature, and the like) in explaining the se-\nmantics of, for example, tenses, quantifiers, and conditional clauses. Although I will not\nhave room to discuss these, they illustrate respects in which H&P impressively achieve\ngreater depth and sophistication than Q et al. in relating syntax to meaning and use.\nNot surprisingly, in spite of all this, there is much to argue about in H&P, and I take\nup some controversial issues in the following sections.\n2 Theory versus description\nThere is no doubt that H&P\u2019s grammar is much more theory-laden than that of Q et al.\nMany of their ideas and analyses show adherence to monostratal phrase structure\nmodels of theoretical syntax \u2013 but with an added emphasis on functional categories\nsuch as predicator, complement, modifier, and, above all, head (the headedness of\nconstructions is a pervasive principle). However, H&P disclaim theory to the extent\nthat they aim (perhaps too optimistically) to urge analyses so persuasively that \u2018even\nsomeone with a different . . . theory of syntax would have to come to a conclusion\ntantamount to ours if they considered all the facts\u2019 (p.19). Thus H&P do not espouse a\nnamed syntactic theory, nor do they attempt the kind of formal explicitness that would\nenable a testable computational model of this grammar to be built. I would attribute\nthis to two factors:\n(a) The comprehensiveness achieved by H&P, or indeed by any such detailed and\nwide-coverage grammar, is not realistically consistent with such explicitness.3 It is\n3 This follows what can be called \u2018Zadeh\u2019s uncertainty principle\u2019 that \u2018In general, complexity and precision bear\nan inverse relation to one another in the sense that as the complexity of a problem increases, the possibility of\nA N E W G R AY \u2019 S A NATO M Y O F E N G L I S H G R A M M A R 125\nworth noting here that H&P are sparing in tree diagrams or any kind of diagrammatic\nor tabular display, considering the range of constructions exemplified. Consequently\none remains in the dark over many puzzling details of constituent analysis, such\nas how to deal with some of the noncanonical clause structures (existential and\ncleft constructions, for example), how to represent the relation between the parts\nof discontinuous structures, or how to analyse the nicely named structures of \u2018nonce-\nconstituent co-ordination\u2019 \u2013 p. 1341.\n(b) From time to time the descriptive analyses implicitly suggest an element of\ndoubt or indeterminacy (e.g. p. 172 on modality, p. 619 on \u2018complex prepositions\u2019,\np. 1114 on than\/as + single element). There is informal use of nondeterminate cognitive\nnotions of \u2018prototype\u2019, \u2018salience\u2019, and \u2018default\u2019. These can be useful to grammarians, in\nallowing exceptional, dispreferred or peripheral cases to be alluded to without specific\ncommitment. Another favourite term, \u2018blurring\u2019, implies recognition of the fact that\ngrammatical analyses are not always of an all-or-nothing, clear-cut nature.\nThese imprecisions are wholly understandable (and I would add, desirable) in a\ngrammar \u2018aim[ing] for as comprehensive coverage as space allows\u2019 (p. xv). They\nsanction a characterization of H&P not as theoretical grammar but as a theory-oriented\ndescriptive grammar. But H&P dislike indeterminacy, and their theoretical orientation\nis evident in the space and effort they devote to explanatory arguments in favour of one\nanalysis or against another. For example, one of the longest arguments is on whether\nin certain cases a reduced clause follows comparative as or than (pp.1114\u201317). On\nthe page, these pieces of argumentation show up as blue-shaded boxes, which vary in\nlength from a few lines to four pages.4\nH&P\u2019s determination to arrive at a single correct analysis contrasts with Q et al.,\nwho are more apt to accept alternative analyses, or to build gradience into their\ndescription.5 This may suggest that Q et al. are less rigorous than H&P, or rather\nthat Q et al. provide a rather different kind of descriptive grammar \u2013 primarily a\nreference grammar, generalizing over observables, aiming to make the description of\nthe language accessible to a wide readership, not just syntacticians.6 Although H&P\nmaintain that they \u2018do not assume any familiarity with theoretical linguistics on the\npart of the reader\u2019 (p. xv), in practice the intensity of detail, including much unfamiliar\nterminology, is likely to deter the nonspecialist.\nanalysing it in precise terms diminishes\u2019 (Zadeh, 1972). The task of writing a comprehensive grammar of a\nlanguage is, most would agree, exceedingly complex.\n4 As H&P put it, \u2018The reader will therefore find much more discussion of grammatical concepts and much more\nsyntactic argumentation than is usually found in grammars of English. It is supplied, however, not to establish\nsome wider theoretical point applying to other languages, but simply to persuade the reader that our description\nis sound\u2019 (pp. 19\u201320).\n5 A well-known case of alternative analyses is the treatment of prepositional verbs as either transitive (verb +\nprep.) or intransitive (verb separated from the following prepositional phrase) (Q et al.: 91). H&P, on the other\nhand, persuasively reject both these analyses in favour of verb + prepositional phrase complement (p. 277).\n6 Perhaps the term \u2018reference grammar\u2019 is more readily employed by publishers than by authors. I do not think\nH&P use this term of their own book, although it is called such on the CUP website.\n126 G E O F F R E Y L E E C H\nTo elaborate this distinction between H&P as more theory-oriented and Q et al.\nas more observation-oriented, I will digress a little, arguing for a scale of abstraction\nrunning from the most data-oriented (inductive) view of grammar to the most theoretical\n(deductive) view. (The corpus-driven approach, rejecting \u2018superimposed\u2019 grammatical\nconcepts in favour of corpus-derived ones, is a prime example of the former \u2013\nsee Sinclair, 2001, Tognini-Bonelli, 2001; whereas, say, the minimalist program of\nChomsky \u2013 see Adger, 2003 \u2013 is a prime example of the latter.) As H&P point out, if any\ngeneralizations are to be made, even the most data-oriented view of grammar requires\nsome model or theory \u2013 minimally, say, an account of parts of speech. It is also true, at the\nother extreme, that a theoretical grammar requires some minimal attention to data: what\nmanifestations of language can occur in given languages. But between these extremes\nlies a broad spectrum of grammatical perspectives, varying in their degree of attention\nto theoretical or evidential concerns. The perspective of descriptive grammar, a term\naccepted by both H&P and Q et al., occupies a broad middle ground of this spectrum,\nand aims at coverage of the phenomena of the language above all, as suggested by\nfigure 1. Far from the naive view that different grammars of the same language are trying\nDATA ORIENTATION DESCRIPTIVE ORIENTATION THEORY ORIENTATION\n       corpus-driven or \ncorpus-informed or using\nother kinds of empirical\nevidence; variational in\nfocus; nondeterministic (in\nusing frequency, gradience,\nalternative analyses) \nworking towards a\ncomprehensive description of\nindividual languages,\ninformed both by evidence\n(especially corpora) and by\ntheory \nusing rigorous and explicit\nformulations; argumentative,\nwith explanatory focus on\nlanguage; answerability to\noverarching theory of\nuniversals and typology \nFigure 1. A scalar view of grammars\nto do the same job, it is evident that even different descriptive grammars of a language\nmay have different orientations, making them difficult to compare. This is true of Q\net al. and H&P. I would place Q et al. towards the left of the centre of figure 1, and\nH&P towards the right.\nThere is also a difference in grammars according to the user-community they address.\nTheoretically inclined linguists will find H&P\u2019s book a goldmine: they will recognize\nmuch of the terminology, and the kinds of generalizations which are being made through\nthe use of such categories as \u2018nominal\u2019 as a major constituent of the noun phrase. They\nwill appreciate the \u2018deep\u2019 trees (there is rarely any exception to singular and binary\nbranching with H&P), which are more explanatory of co-ellipsis, scope phenomena,\nand, above all, co-ordination7 than the \u2018shallow trees\u2019 of Q et al.\n7 However, be it noted that co-ordination is one of the exceptional cases where H&P allow multiple branching \u2013\nsee p.1279. Although co-ordination will be neglected in this article, I should not neglect to mention that\nchapter 15, mainly on co-ordination, is one of the most impressive and innovative in the book.\nA N E W G R AY \u2019 S A NATO M Y O F E N G L I S H G R A M M A R 127\nOn the other hand, many users of Q et al.\u2019s book will find it difficult to adapt to the\nfrequently abstruse terminology of H&P (see section 10 below), together with some\nradical solutions including a redrawing of the boundaries between word classes such\nas prepositions and adverbs (see sections 3\u20135 below), and between major constituents\nsuch as phrases and clauses. They may also be happier to stick with the shallow trees\nsuch as (21b) below, which, although less explanatory of certain syntactic phenomena,\nare more usable both for textual analysis and for mapping from syntactic structures to\nsyntactic functions (such as subject, object) and to semantic arguments.\nThe differentiation between H&P and Q et al. as more theory-oriented and more\ndata-oriented respectively should not be interpreted simplistically. Q et al. are data-\noriented in a sense that grew out of the pioneering evidential investigation of grammar\nat the Survey of English Usage (SEU) in the 1960s and 1970s. H&P\u2019s book is not\ndevoid of good illustrative use of corpora, but their use of corpora is exemplificatory\nrather than an integral part of the analysis. A footnote on p.11 acknowledges the\nuse of three small written corpora, the Brown (American), ACE (Australian), and\nLOB (British) corpora, together with the Wall Street Journal.8 But these sources\n(two of them some forty years old) could not have been used to investigate the\nmost important dimensions of language variety: in particular, they contain no spoken\nEnglish.\nAdvances in corpus linguistics, and in the availability of corpus resources for English,\nhave been so enormous since Q et al.\u2019s grammar was written, that H&P would not have\nfound it difficult to exploit corpora \u2013 not just for finding suitable examples, but for\nverifying degrees of acceptability, for investigating or checking usage in different\nvarieties, for making or validating statements of frequency, and so on. On the positive\nside, however, H&P have indeed made good use of attested examples (not just from\nelectronic corpora), and their invented examples are on the whole natural-sounding \u2013\nseldom falling into the wooden artificiality of exemplification associated with much\nsyntactic theorizing.9 But for the corpus linguist, however, they show too strong a\ntendency to judge acceptability in clear-cut ways which suit the analytic point being\nillustrated. The desire to seek a decisive answer to all research questions is too strong,\nin particular, when examples of borderline acceptability are judged to be either fully\ngrammatical or fully ungrammatical. The following (presumably unattested) examples\nfrom the book are here presented without the asterisk which precedes half of them in\nH&P. The reader is invited to judge where the asterisk, according to H&P, should or\nshould not be placed:\n(1) both Kim, Pat and Alex . . . (p. 361)\n(2) Have finished before I return. (p. 932)\n(3) To who are you referring? (p. 465)\n8 The misaffiliation of LOB as the \u2018London\/Oslo\/Bergen\u2019 corpus (London replacing Lancaster) is particularly\npainful to the present reviewer!\n9 Old acquaintances from theoretical textbooks, such as Sue and Max, make only rare appearances in H&P\u2019s\nexamples, although another old friend, Kim, makes her (his?) appearance with preternatural frequency.\n128 G E O F F R E Y L E E C H\n(4) Don\u2019t have eaten all the pizza by the time I get back. (p. 802)\n(5) He returned to me the key. (p. 1018)\n(6) He often isn\u2019t there when you call him, isn\u2019t he? (p. 801)\n(7) Two serious harms were done to the project\u2019s prospects. (p. 337)\n(8) Have you loved me and I been so inconsiderate as to make myself unworthy of your\nlove? (p. 97)\n(9) We expected all along an improvement. (p.1180)10\nMy guess is that most readers who try this test will not achieve better results than if they\nhad tossed a coin. H&P are somewhat too ready to brand an example as ungrammatical\nor accept it as grammatical, without allowing for the in-between cases. (Although they\ndo allow for the marking of examples with ? as of questionable grammaticality, this\nsymbol is rarely used.)11\nHowever, it is also true that, despite little use of corpus data, H&P covers variation\nbetween BrE and AmE well.12 Not surprisingly, considering that most of the book\nwas written in Australia, some attention is also given to Australian English, as well\nas \u2013 occasionally \u2013 New Zealand English. (This is a clear improvement on Q et al.\nwho, as far as regional variety is concerned, were almost exclusively concerned with\nBrE and AmE, with only token references to other national varieties.) Although often\nanalytically avant-garde, H&P, like Q et al., are culturally conservative in assuming (in\nthe terms of Kachru\u2019s concentric circle model \u2013 Kachru, 1985) that the \u2018inner circle\u2019 of\npredominantly native-English-speaking nations determines standard English. In view\nof the growing prominence of the new Englishes of the outer circle (Singaporean,\nIndian, West African English, etc.) and the growing use of \u2018international English\u2019 as\na lingua franca among non-native speakers (Seidlhofer, 2001), it is becoming more\nquestionable today than in 1985 that native speakers\u2019 English from the \u2018first world\u2019 is all\nthat a reference grammar need take note of. H&P accept as uncontroversial the notion\nof a standard international English based on inner-circle language, splitting it into\n10 In H&P, the even-numbered examples in this list are judged acceptable, and odd-numbered ones are marked\nwith asterisks. Measured against corpus evidence, some of these judgements are questionable: for example\nthe plural noun harms (excluded by H&P) occurs 17 times in the British National Corpus (BNC), in perfectly\nordinary-seeming contexts such as (7). Similarly, the use of both . . . and with three conjuncts is not particularly\nunusual: I found more than a few examples in the BNC, mainly in published texts. An exhaustive search of the\nBNC has revealed no examples of imperatives beginning Have + past participle or Don\u2019t have + past participle\n(cf. (2) and (4)).\n11 Apart from * and ?, other warning symbols used to label examples are % (\u2018grammatical in some dialect(s)\nonly\u2019), # (\u2018semantically or pragmatically anomalous\u2019) and ! (\u2018non-standard\u2019).\n12 One weakness in H&P\u2019s coverage is on the AmE avoidance of plural agreement with singular collective nouns\n(pp. 501\u20132), a well-known area of difference between AmE and BrE. Although the authors acknowledge that the\nplural agreement is \u2018more common in BrE than in AmE\u2019, they go on: \u2018It must be emphasised, however, that the\nplural construction is unquestionably fully grammatical in Standard English\u2019 (presumably for both AmE and\nBrE). This statement is typical of H&P\u2019s preference for clear-cut grammaticality solutions (see section 2),\nbut overlooks accumulating corpus evidence (see Levin, 2001; Depraetere, 2003: 103\u20134) of significant\ndifferences between AmE and BrE. This is not just a matter of frequency (although, from figures in Levin,\n1999: 26\u20137, it appears that plural verb agreement with collectives is over twice as common in written BrE as\nin written AmE). It is also a question of lexical and semantic factors: for example, singular names of sports\nteams, as in Tottenham is\/are winning, are not attested with plural verbs in AmE (Biber et al., 1999: 189).\nA N E W G R AY \u2019 S A NATO M Y O F E N G L I S H G R A M M A R 129\ntwo major dialect areas springing from standard educated BrE and AmE respectively\n(pp. 4\u20135).\nFurther, again like Q et al., H&P conservatively follow millennia-long grammatical\ntradition in placing the written language in the foreground of attention (pp. 11\u201312).\nExtensive and varied corpora are now available (see Leech, 2000) for the study of\nthe spoken language, and research on the real data of spontaneous spoken dialogue\n(e.g. Biber et al. 1999: 1038\u2013125; Carter & McCarthy, 1995) has revealed how far the\nobserved typical forms of spoken language stray from the assumedly \u2018canonical\u2019 forms\nof written syntax.13 While H&P acknowledge spoken varieties of standard English,\nthey seem to be thinking of those public, prepared varieties of speech closest to the\nwritten medium:\nwe are describing the kind of English that is widely accepted in the countries of the world\nwhere English is the language of government, education, broadcasting, entertainment,\nand other public discourse. (H&P: p. 4)\nWhat this leaves out of account is the most commonly exercised of all varieties of\nEnglish \u2013 that of spontaneous conversational dialogue. This big gap in coverage,\nless excusable today than in the 1980s, raises the question of whether we can accept\nconversational English as belonging to the standard variety at all. While sympathetic\nto the construct of \u2018standard international English\u2019 (SiE) for the written medium,\nI feel that by largely excluding spontaneous speech from their territory, H&P have\nmanaged to let this construct of SiE conveniently stand proxy for the language as a\nwhole, ignoring the grey areas that inevitably come into consideration when one tries\nto apply the term \u2018standard English\u2019 to the spoken medium. Consequently, the clear-cut\nview of grammar that H&P put forward is aided and abetted by a clear-cut view of the\nstandard language: for example, they dismiss relative clauses with resumptive pronouns\nas ungrammatical in English (p.1091), although some resumptive-pronoun clauses are\nnot uncommon (and seem peripherally standard) in speech.14 Nonclausal elements\n(minor clauses, interjections) characteristic of speech are given little attention, and\nthe much-investigated use of words like okay, well, like, etc. as discourse markers is\nignored. By saying \u2018the only legitimate basis for an absolute judgement of incorrectness\nin a usage manual is that what is being rejected is not in the standard language\u2019 (p.10 \u2013\nin criticism of the prescriptivist tradition), H&P reveal an uncompromising strain in\ntheir own thinking.\n13 Admirable though H&P\u2019s treatment of interrogatives is in chapter 10, close attention to dialogic forms like\ninterrogatives doesn\u2019t necessarily redress the general balance in favour of spoken English. Biber et al. (1999:\n211) report, in their corpus-based grammar, that nearly half the questions in speech are fragmentary \u2013 tags or\nnonclausal structures \u2013 the latter scarcely commented on in chapter 10\u2019s treatment. So even for interrogatives,\nwith their built-in bias towards the spoken medium, there is a tendency to overlook what occurs frequently in\nconversation, and to focus on what is canonically explicit and well-formed.\n14 Prince (1990) gives examples such as There are always guests who I am curious about what they are going\nto say, and comments: \u2018relative clauses with resumptive pronouns are officially ungrammatical in English . . .\nHowever, they are in fact not uncommon in speech.\u2019 See also examples in Biber et al. (1999: 622).\n130 G E O F F R E Y L E E C H\nWhy does this kind of thinking matter in grammar? It shows up in the rather\narbitrary way that certain usages are accepted or rejected, without recognition of their\nproblematical status. For example, the \u2018hypercorrect\u2019 use of nominative pronouns after\nprepositions as in %It would be an opportunity for you and I to spend some time together\n(p. 463) is marked as \u2018acceptable in some standard English dialects but not in others\u2019,\nin contrast with !Me and Larry are going to the movies \u2013 marked as nonstandard.\nHowever, in terms of frequency and range of use (the criteria H&P claim to be using),\nthere is little doubt that the \u2018stigmatized\u2019 subject construction of Me and Harry or\nHarry and me is more widespread than the hypercorrect form of for Harry and I (cf.\nBiber et al., 1999: 337\u20139). There may be some covert linguistic gentility operating here\n\u2013 preference for the hypercorrect rather than the hypocorrect form \u2013 but my main point\nis that the drawing of lines between standard and nonstandard usage can be fraught with\ndifficulty in speech, and once again there is need to recognize some kind of gradient \u2013\nin this case a gradient of \u2018standardness\u2019.\n3 Part-of-speech classification\nMy plan now is to move on to some descriptive issues where H&P are likely to be judged\nas innovative, if not daring, in their departure from grammatical traditions. Throughout\nthe book, H&P avoid overt critical reference to other grammarians and positions in\nthe published literature \u2013 as is understandable, for space reasons alone, in a work of\nthis scope. Instead, they make use of a conveniently generalized aunt sally \u2013 known as\n\u2018traditional grammar\u2019. This term covers a multitude of sins: it is \u2018traditional grammar\u2019,\nfor example, that insists that there are six forms of took \u2013 one for each combination of\nthree persons and two numbers \u2013 and it is also \u2018traditional grammar\u2019 that gives us the\nmajor part-of-speech categories which are more or less universally adopted by English\ndictionaries: e.g. in treating if as a subordinating conjunction, and then as an adverb. I\nwould argue though that these are two very different notions of \u2018traditional grammar\u2019.\nOne comes from a procrustean Latinate grammar that had its heyday in the eighteenth\ncentury, while the other is still \u2018mainstream\u2019, in that there will have to be a wholesale\nrevision of not only dictionaries, but grammars, part-of-speech tagged corpora, and\nELT textbooks, if H&P manage to persuade the world that their analysis is right.\nAs a case in point, H&P redefine some major word classes: they redefine prepositions\nas a much expanded and numerous category, to the detriment of adverbs and\nsubordinators (or subordinating conjunctions), which are much reduced in number.\nOther categories which undergo substantial change are determinatives (the term\n\u2018determiner\u2019 is reserved for the corresponding functional category, so that H&P have\nunhelpfully reversed the use of these terms \u2018determiner\u2019 and \u2018determinative\u2019 in Q et al.).\nAuxiliary verbs, pronouns, and numerals disappear from the inventory of word\nclasses at the highest level. Auxiliary verbs become in effect main verbs; pronouns\nbecome a subcategory of nouns, and numerals are subsumed under the determinative\ncategory.\nA N E W G R AY \u2019 S A NATO M Y O F E N G L I S H G R A M M A R 131\n4 Prepositions, adverbs, and subordinators\nThe two most far-reaching of these recategorizations are those of preposition, adverb,\nand conjunction (which are interrelated, and can therefore be best considered together)\nand those of determinative and pronoun (see the next section).\nIn the H&P treatment, there is a fascinating inverse relation between prepositions\nand adverbs. Whereas grammars like Q et al. define prepositions as close to their\netymological meaning \u2013 words which are placed before a noun phrase or other\nprepositional complement (barring, of course, preposition stranding as a special case),\nH&P extend the class of prepositions to include postpositions like ago, and \u2018intransitive\nprepositions\u2019 like about, afterwards, ashore, downstairs, east, else, heavenward(s),\nhere, home, indoors, north, now, south, then,west, westward(s), when,where,whenever,\nwhence, as well as clause-introducing prepositions such as if , because and while.\nAlthough \u2018pre-position\u2019 is no longer a suitable label, H&P uncharacteristically stick\nwith the established term preposition (p. 602) despite its loss of appropriateness.\nOn the other hand, H&P diminish the class of adverbs so that it matches more closely\nits etymological meaning:\nAdverbs characteristically modify verbs and other categories except nouns, especially\nadjectives and adverbs. (p. 563)\nAs for prepositions, their definition as an extended class is so vague that it has roughly\nchanged places with the woolly definition of adverbs found in \u2018traditional grammar\u2019:\nPREPOSITION: a relatively closed grammatically distinct class of words whose most central\nmembers characteristically express spatial relations and serve to mark various syntactic\nfunctions and semantic roles. (p. 603)\nJust about the only definite thing this tells us about prepositions \u2013 if one can ignore\nhedging expressions such as \u2018most central members\u2019 and \u2018characteristically\u2019 \u2013 is that\nthey are associated with spatial relations. Surely this is a reversion to the old-fashioned\nnotional definition of parts of speech, rightly castigated by H&P in their opening chapter\n(pp. 29\u201331). But in any case it doesn\u2019t help us with words like then and if , neither of\nwhich is spatial.15\nH&P\u2019s case for considering words like then and if prepositions depends on the\nargument of parallelism with verbs (and other categories) subclassified according\nto their complementation, as shown in table 2. See and since are versatile words\nwhich can accept different complement patterns. But consider a verb like elapse\nwhich can only be intransitive, a verb like beat which can only be monotransitive,\nor a verb like retort which can only have a clausal complement. If these are all\nverbs, goes the argument, then on the same grounds both then (intransitive) and if\n15 One of the difficulties of H&P\u2019s expansion of the preposition category at the expense of adverbs is that a word\nstanding alone as head of an adjunct or modifier constituent can belong to either category. Hence the authors\nsometimes find difficulty deciding which of the two classes a word belongs to \u2013 see their discussion of else\n(p. 615 n.).\n132 G E O F F R E Y L E E C H\nTable 2. Comparable complementation of verbs and prepositions\n(a) verb (b) preposition\n(10) no complement I see. I\u2019ve met her since.\n(11) NP as complement I see the problem. I\u2019ve met her since the game.\n(12) clause as complement I see you\u2019re alone. I\u2019ve met her since she left.\n(with clausal complement) can be deemed prepositions just as with can. This\nargument gains force from the fact that items such as since can be given a unitary\ndescription as prepositions, instead of being classified as an adverb in (10b), a\npreposition in (11b), and a subordinator in (12b). According to H&P, this sort\nof unitary assignment avoids \u2018a quite pointless complication of the grammar\u2019\n(p. 1015), since the \u2018multiplication of categories for a single word with a single\nmeaning makes no sense\u2019. However, this argument is undermined somewhat by the\nfact that the causative meaning of since is peculiar to its use as a subordinator, whereas\nthe temporal meaning applies to all three items. Also, the parallel between (a) and (b)\nsentences in table 2 ignores the fact that inflectional morphology provides a strong\nreason for regarding verbs as verbs, whatever their complementation, whereas there is\nno such morphological argument for a \u2018super-class\u2019 of prepositions.\nAnother of H&P\u2019s arguments is that traditionally prepositions are allowed to take\nclausal complements of certain kinds, but not others: e.g. a standard preposition like\non can be followed not only by an NP, as in it depends on the weather, but also by a\nclause in on arriving at the hospital and it depends on whether you vote. They see this\nas muddying the distinction between prepositions and conjunctions that \u2018traditional\ngrammar\u2019 upholds (pp. 1012\u201313). But they miss an important generalization captured\nin Q et al. and similar grammars, in the category of nominal clause \u2013 a clause, that is,\nwhich has the privilege of occurrence of an NP. Interrogative clauses such as what you\nsay or whether you vote above are nominal, and so are -ing clauses such as arriving\nat the hospital. Prepositions that can accept \u2018nominalization\u2019 NPs as complement can\nalso accept such nominal clause complements. Here are illustrations with in, by, of,\nabout, at, and to:\ninterested in a house intrigued by her boots\ninterested in buying a house intrigued by your eating goldfish\ninterested in where you\u2019d buy a house intrigued by whether it would work\nit\u2019s part of the deal talked about the new alliance\nit\u2019s part of growing up in the city talked about getting a new car\nit\u2019s part of whether you succeed or not talked about when we\u2019d leave\nsurprised at the mayhem with a view to marriage\nsurprised at making a profit with a view to getting married\nsurprised at how long it lasted with a view to which venue was best\nA N E W G R AY \u2019 S A NATO M Y O F E N G L I S H G R A M M A R 133\nOn the other hand, subordinators such as if, while, because, although, and unless\ndo not take such complements, except in the case of what Q et al. call \u2018abbreviated\nclauses\u2019. These abbreviated clauses involve ellipsis of the subject of the clause and a\nfinite form of be, but retain the subordinator. Notice it is possible for an abbreviated\nclause to contain a predicative adjective phrase, noun phrase or prepositional phrase as\npredicative complement, as well as an -ed clause: if still working, if unsound, if a male\nmodel, if at home, if accepted, etc.\nConsequently, in spite of an overlap between prepositions and subordinators in the\narea of -ing clauses, there is a clear difference between the array of sequences that can\noccur in a prepositional phrase and an abbreviated clause:\nPREPOSITIONAL PHRASE: ABBREVIATED CLAUSE:\n(13) despite their arrival \u2217although their arrival\n(14) despite dating from the 1400s although dating from the 1400s\n(15) despite who said what \u2217although who said what\n(16) \u2217despite careful with money although careful with money\n(17) \u2217despite made of solid steel although made of solid steel\n(18) \u2217despite they arrived on time although they arrived on time\n(19) \u2217despite under new management although under new management\n(The asterisk for *although their arrival could be removed if the following noun phrase\ncould be interpreted as a predicative complement: although a woman of fortune.)\nThe paradigms displayed above represent quite a powerful generalization\ndifferentiating the syntactic potential of prepositions and conjunctions. This\ngeneralization would, of course, disappear if the two categories were merged16 in\nthe way H&P propose (although H&P could still handle the same phenomena by the\nsubcategorization properties of individual items). It is also worth bearing in mind\nthat stranded prepositions occur in English grammar, while stranded conjunctions do\nnot:\na bus that I\u2019m waiting for *a true champion that he\u2019ll win if\nIt is true that a few words have the syntactic privileges of both classes: before,\nafter, since, notwithstanding, as, and some descriptive disadvantage arises from\ntheir separation. But surely this is less than the advantage of keeping the classes\nseparate. Similarly, there is some disadvantage in keeping separate the cases like\nexcept (preposition) and except that (conjunction), while H&P would treat that alone\nas the optional conjunction, introducing a declarative content clause. What I feel\nsure of is that the arguments for merging are not so \u2018compelling\u2019 (p. 1013) as H&P\nclaim.\n16 The merger is not complete, but traditional subordinating conjunctions are abolished in H&P except for a\n\u2018rump\u2019 category of subordinators consisting of that, whether, and if (= \u2018whether\u2019) (p. 600). Tellingly, the\nauthors here condone the fault they criticize in traditional grammar, of splitting a word unnecessarily into two\ndifferent word classes: for traditional grammar, conditional if (for H&P a preposition) and if (= \u2018whether\u2019) (for\nH&P a conjunction) are both subordinators. (A similar split of how into adverb and subordinator categories is\nallowed for on p. 954.)\n134 G E O F F R E Y L E E C H\nA problem of defining the expanded class of prepositions is that it lacks\nmorphological clues. This leads H&P to rely on a strange mixture of tests \u2013 a negative\ninflectional criterion (lack of -ly) and a positive syntactic criterion (ability to take a\ncomplement) \u2013 as distinctive of prepositions:\nThis provides, then, a reasonably clear basis for distinguishing between prepositions\nand adverbs. If a word not ending in the -ly suffix licenses a complement, it is not\nan adverb; if a word other than those of the type covered in [30\u201331] fails to license a\ncomplement, it is not a preposition. (p. 617; [30\u201331] refers to lists of spatial and nonspatial\nprepositions)\nThis definition statement may be \u2018clear\u2019, but is it motivated? Implicitly H&P seem\nto have fallen back on the traditional idea that a preposition needs a prepositional\ncomplement. As they say earlier: \u2018Prototype prepositions have NP complements,\nand other items will be admitted into the preposition category only if there is\npositive evidence to support such an extension beyond core members\u2019 (p. 612). It\nis significant that H&P here apply the nondeterministic notion of prototype to a\nsyntactic category, whereas elsewhere they tend to confine prototype thinking to\nsemantic categories. Altogether, the attempt to elevate the preposition to a major\nword category is unconvincing, and seems to hark back historically to Chomsky\u2019s\nfeature theory of word categories (Chomsky, 1970), now largely discarded (see Baker,\n2003: 2).\n5 Trade-offs between lexicon and grammar\nH&P have comparatively little to say about the lexicon or dictionary their grammar\nimplies \u2013 perhaps someone should publish such a lexicon. However, the word-class\nconflations mentioned above do not entail a simplification of the grammar. If anything,\nit is a simplification of the lexicon if one word is assigned to one word class rather\nthan two or three. But of course the different frames or functions into which a word\nfits still have to be specified within one entry of the lexicon. H&P generally seem to\nfollow a principle of simplifying the mapping from lexemes or word forms to word\nclasses as much as possible. If we consider further instances: both is considered a\ndeterminative whether it functions in a simple NP or as a correlative co-ordinator; and\nthe words some, any, and that (except for that as a subordinator) are assigned to a\nsingle class of determinative. This same label applies to them, whether (in Q et al.\nterms) they function as head (That is mine), determiner (That hat is mine) or adverb\n(that tall). This simplifies the lexicon in one direction, but passes on the complexity to\nthe mapping between grammatical words and their grammatical functions. For H&P,\nthe three functions illustrated by these examples are determiner, determiner-head, and\nmodifier.\nThe second of these functions exemplifies an important theoretical innovation by\nH&P: the fused-head analysis permitting a single word to span more than one\nsyntactic function in the same NP. This introduces a further complexity into the\nA N E W G R AY \u2019 S A NATO M Y O F E N G L I S H G R A M M A R 135\nlexicon\u2013grammar mapping, constituting a radical breach of the single-mother condition\nnormally presumed to apply in phrase structure grammars. For here we have a single\nword, say few in few of her friends (see (20)), as daughter of two higher nodes, nominal\nand NP.\n(20)\n(from Huddleston & Pullum, 2002: 412)\nAn advantage of this, from H&P\u2019s point of view, is that it enables them to assign a\nsingle part-of-speech analysis to the items spelt this, these, those, some, any, several,\netc., whereas in Q et al., for example, these have dual roles as determiner and pronoun.\nH&P can do this, because they see determinatives as having a dual function \u2013 both as\ndeterminer and as determiner-fused-with-head. They argue (pp. 420\u20131) unconvincingly,\nin my view, the necessity of this analysis, by rejecting alternatives relying on (a)\nmultiple part-of-speech assignment, (b) ellipsis, (c) dual functional analysis of these\nwords as head and determiner \u2013 though why (c) would be a worse solution than the dual\nfunctionality of determiner and determiner+head which the authors adopt is unclear.\nSimilarly, regarding (b), they accept ellipsis in other aspects of the NP, so why not here?\nThere are a number of unconvincing aspects of this fused-head analysis. One is that\nhaving argued for the absence of the genitive inflection from fused-head items, H&P go\nas far as to include compound pronouns like somebody and everyone as determinatives \u2013\ndespite their readiness to accept genitive forms (somebody\u2019s, everyone\u2019s). One argument\nthey give for treating these compound pronouns as determinatives is that \u2018because\ndeterminer and head are fused it is not possible for these forms to take internal pre-\nhead dependents\u2019 (p. 423) such as *sensible anybody \u2013 but of course this would\nalso apply if these items were treated as pronouns as most grammarians assume.\nIt is also a strange consequence of the fused-head analysis that demonstratives are\ndeterminatives (not pronouns), although they frequently behave similarly to the pronoun\nit in deictic\/anaphoric use: \u2018Hello \u2013 who\u2019s that?\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s Hilary\u2019, etc.\nAnother consequence of this analysis is that the pronoun category, like those of\nadverb and subordinator, is reduced to the core class of personal pronouns and a\nfew outlying groups such as reciprocal, interrogative, and relative pronouns plus,\nunexpectedly, yesterday, today, and tomorrow. (These last three are argued to be\npronouns \u2018by virtue of their inability to take determiners\u2019 \u2013 but why does this same\nargument not apply to somebody, everything, etc.?)\n136 G E O F F R E Y L E E C H\nThe fusion of constituents comes in more convincingly with what H&P call the\nfused relative construction (\u2018nominal relative clauses\u2019 in Q et al.), as in I spent\nwhat she gave me. The by-now mainstream argument that what she gave me here\nis an NP, not a clause, is strongly supported by H&P, who assign to what in this\nconstruction the combined functions of head of the NP and prenucleus in the relative\nclause. Nevertheless, H&P acknowledge that \u2018it is by no means a straightforward\nmatter to distinguish between the fused relative and subordinate interrogative [clause]\nconstructions\u2019 (p. 1077). Although semantically the fused relative construction is\nundeniably NP-like, syntactically its clause-like structure is likewise difficult to deny \u2013\nwithout the special mechanism of fused constituency.\nThe enlargement of the preposition category, as already noted, leads to a reduction\nof subordinators (or subordinating conjunctions) to a residual category of five: that,\nwhether, if (= whether), and for and to (introducing infinitive constructions). This goes\nwith the reduction of the categories of [finite] subordinate clauses to three: content\nclauses, relative clauses, and comparative clauses. These are defined by their structure:\ncontent clauses, like main clauses, are subdivided into declarative, interrogative, and\nexclamative types. Content clauses are also treated as the \u2018default\u2019 category having the\nleast constraint of defining structural characteristics and occurring in varied positions\ncorresponding to Q et al.\u2019s adverbial clauses, that-clauses, wh-clauses, etc.17 Certainly\nthere is economy in this analysis of subordination, both at the word-class level (i.e.\nfew subordinators) and at the clause level (i.e. few clause types), but this is at the\nexpense of both formal and functional economy. Content clauses, in particular, are\nso variable in their form and function that they seem totally unconstrained. They\ncan function as subject, object, adjunct, clausal complement, predicative complement,\ncomplement of nouns, adjectives, adverbs or preposition, postposed subject or object,\nsupplement. Structurally, they can have normal declarative order, various types of\npreposing, subject\u2013auxiliary inversion, an infinitive main verb, and so on.\nOne might summarize the effects of H&P\u2019s innovations noted in this and the\npreceding section as \u2018swings and roundabouts\u2019. By assigning most subordinating\nconjunctions to the preposition category, H&P have in effect put more of the grammar\ninto phrases, and less into clauses. This is good from the point of view of constraining\nthe form\u2013function interrelations: phrases are associated with particular word classes as\nhead (e.g. prepositions as head of prepositional phrases), and on the whole the functions\nof phrases in clauses are well defined. However, the negative side is (a) at clause level,\nand (b) at word-class level. At clause level, the relation between subordinate clause\ntypes and their functions in higher constituents is left unclear. Although the ultimate\nhead of a clause is said to be a verb, this does not seem to constrain the positions of\n17 Declarative content clauses typically have an SVO order of constituents, but this doesn\u2019t apply to some\nconstructions H&P deem content clauses. For example, the proportional clause of The more we talked, the\nmore I liked her (p. 970) is syntactically similar to a comparative or relative clause \u2013 but is assigned \u2018by default\u2019\nto the content clause category.\nA N E W G R AY \u2019 S A NATO M Y O F E N G L I S H G R A M M A R 137\nclauses in other clauses and in phrases. And the content clause (see last paragraph) is\na complete chameleon category.\nAt word-class level, the problem is again that, although assignment of words to\nmultiple word classes is reduced (conspicuously for words like before and since),\nthe function of these word classes in higher constituents is allowed to proliferate. As\nan example, we might take the words both and either, which H&P consider to be\ndeterminatives not only in their usual NP-based functions, but also in their function\nas first element of a correlative co-ordination construction (e.g. both at home and\nabroad; either you like it or you don\u2019t). In this respect H&P seem to turn a blind eye\nto multiplicity of functions, and it is particularly difficult for the user of the grammar\nto keep a check on such multiplicity, as the lexical index (with several exceptions)\ngives no information about either the word classes or the functional distribution of\nwords. This is particularly unhelpful with a word like either, which is simply listed\nwith twenty-five undifferentiated references in the index, although in dictionaries and\nother grammars it is likely to occur with four grammatical labels (determiner, pronoun,\ncorrelative co-ordinator, adverb), signalling its functional potential \u2013 information not\nrecoverable from H&P.\n6 Constituent structure: deep trees versus shallow trees\nAs noted in section 2 above, H&P adopt a deep-tree rather than a shallow-tree style of\nconstituent structure, with a large number of nodes per sentence and a small number\nof daughter nodes per parent node. Q et al., on the other hand, tend to favour shallow\ntrees, although they also occasionally offer the deep-tree analysis as an alternative. See\n(21a and b) for contrasting tree diagrams of the simple sentence: They must have been\neating popcorn.\n(21a) (21b)\n138 G E O F F R E Y L E E C H\nDeep-tree structure shows up strongly in the analysis of both VPs and NPs. For NPs,\nH&P adopt a multi-level structure involving intermediate nominal nodes, whereas\nin VPs, they adopt the multi-level auxiliary = main verb analysis (see (21a) above).\nThis has advantages in being more explanatory of semantic relations and syntactic\nfunctions within the phrase. Also, much of it is well motivated by potential constituency\nunder co-ordination and ellipsis. On the other hand, it has the disadvantage of being\nunwieldy for practical tree representation. Intermediate nodes and multi-word heads\nare routine, so that single-word heads in the sense of Q et al. have to be characterized\nas \u2018ultimate heads\u2019. H&P themselves resort to practical short-cuts in representing tree\nstructure, such as ignoring the nominal node level or the AdjP level where there is\nsingular branching, in a simple noun phrase like a woman (p. 55) or a simple case of\nadjectival modification: an excellent result (p. 57): \u2018we simplify the tree diagrams by\nomitting the higher-level constituents if they consist of just a head element\u2019. Another\ndrawback is that with more than one modifier the structure of more complex NPs\ncan be semantically over-determined, so that a recent experiment on rats could be\nanalysed either as a [[recent experiment] [on rats]], or as a [recent [experiment [on\nrats]]]. A difference of constituent structure doesn\u2019t always go with a difference of\nmeaning.\nTurning now to VPs (which are analysed in H&P, unlike Q et al., as including\ncomplements and adjuncts of the verb), H&P espouse the catenative-auxiliary analysis\n(p.104) whereby in effect auxiliary verbs are considered main verbs.18 More exactly,\nfor H&P, auxiliary verbs (except the copula be, which is also an auxiliary \u2013 strangely\ncalled \u2018non-core\u2019 in spite of its overwhelming frequency) are a subset of catenative\nverbs \u2013 verbs taking nonfinite clauses as complements (such as want, promise, begin,\netc.). H&P contrast their analysis with the dependent auxiliary analysis found in Q\net al.19 and elsewhere, and discuss at length (pp. 1210\u201320) its advantages relating\nto negation, temporal specification, constituency, preposing, position of adjuncts, and\nco-ordination. The consequence of this analysis is that subordinate clause constituents\nare recursively proliferated, as shown in (21a) above, as contrasted with the dependent\nauxiliary analysis a` la Q et al. illustrated in (21b).\nH&P characteristically adopt \u2018categorial thinking\u2019 in following the logic of the\ncatenative analysis to its ultimate, while Q et al. adopt \u2018noncategorial thinking\u2019\nin postulating a gradient between the analysis of (21b) (for auxiliaries) and (21a)\n(for catenatives), recognizing quasi-modals, semi-auxiliaries, and catenatives as\nintermediate classes on a gradient between auxiliaries and main verbs. However, with\nuncharacteristic tolerance of alternative analyses, H&P recognize the practical merit,\nin text analysis, of adopting the dependent auxiliary analysis. For the VP in (21b) they\n18 An important aspect of H&P\u2019s catenative analysis is that the complements of a catenative verb are not assigned\na more specific function, such as object, predicative, or adjunct.\n19 However, strictly Q et al. do not commit themselves to the position that every phrase has a head \u2013 thus, for\nthem, neither the auxiliary nor the main verb is a head.\nA N E W G R AY \u2019 S A NATO M Y O F E N G L I S H G R A M M A R 139\nuse the term \u2018verb group\u2019, and comment: \u2018This ad hoc term reflects our view that the\ncategory is not theoretically justified but may have some practical descriptive value\u2019\n(p. 1213, note).\nTo provide one more illustration of the deep-tree analysis, we turn to prepositional\nphrases. The interest here focuses on \u2018complex prepositions\u2019 such as in front of , where\nH&P (pp. 620\u20135) generally opt for an analysis which embeds one PP in another, as\nin (22).\n(22)\n(from Huddleston & Pullum, 2002: 620 \u2013 example (9a))\nWhat is notable here is H&P\u2019s clear determination to demarcate syntactic considerations\nfrom lexico-semantic ones. In terms of grammaticalization theory, in front of is\nevidently well on the road to coalescence, lexically and semantically, into a single\nunit, and it might be argued that this affects syntax (in making in front of comparable\nwith its antonym behind). But H&P dismiss the single-constituent \u2018complex\npreposition\u2019 analysis except in a few cases. Again, this contrasts characteristically with\nQ et al., who opt for an analysis of the same phenomena in terms of gradience \u2013\na gradient between the single-preposition and preposition + noun + preposition\nanalyses.\n7 Gaps versus movement\nIn keeping with their nontransformational phrase structure approach, H&P scrupu-\nlously avoid any implication of processes linking one tree structure with another. In-\nstead, they make extensive use of gap constituents a` la GPSG, and of coindexing (i . . . i)\nbetween gaps and other constituents. This works pre-eminently well for unbounded\ndependency constructions (see (23)).\n140 G E O F F R E Y L E E C H\n(23)\n(from Huddleston & Pullum, 2002: 49 \u2013 example (7))\nThis strategy enables the canonical declarative order of major constituents to be\npreserved while accounting for mismatches between the underlying semantic structure\nand overt syntactic structure (e.g. in process parlance, dealing with fronting, postponing,\nraising, or omission of constituents). All implication of movement or of other processes\nlinking an underlying and a surface phrase marker is studiously avoided.20 Very\noccasionally a process term is used: for example, \u2018raised complement\u2019, \u2018preposing\u2019, and\n\u2018PP fronting\u2019 \u2013 but no concession to transformational thinking is made in the way such\nterms are defined. Thus a raised complement is defined simply as \u2018one which belongs\nsemantically in a lower clause than that in which it functions syntactically\u2019 (p. 65).\nHowever, the terminological consequences of avoiding transformational thinking can\nbe less than happy, as when the phenomenon termed \u2018transferred negation\u2019 in Q et al.\nis described as \u2018conventionalisation of specificity increase\u2019 (p. 842).\nH&P invoke gap analysis more questionably when they apply it to initial\nadjuncts as in If you pay mei, I\u2019ll do it---------i (p. 1092) or to preposing of NPs as in\nAnything you don\u2019t eat put --------- back in the fridge (p. 1372) \u2013 where --------- signals the gap.\nIn the latter case there is no coreferential indexing and the gap simply marks the position\nthat the object of put would canonically take in the deep-tree analysis. But here H&P\nmay be said to have their cake and eat it, stipulating that \u2018prenuclear elements that are\nlinked to a gap are interpreted as having the function of that gap\u2019 (p. 1038). Hence in\n20 A similar nontransformational stance is maintained by Q et al., who define a bi-directional relation of \u2018systematic\ncorrespondence\u2019 as a means of making generalizations which could otherwise be expressed transformationally.\nHowever, Q et al. are somewhat less systematic (or less pedantic?) than H&P in avoiding transformational\nimplications of terminology.\nA N E W G R AY \u2019 S A NATO M Y O F E N G L I S H G R A M M A R 141\nthis manner of speaking, put can be said to have two objects \u2013 of which one is a gap\nconstituent, and one a preposed NP termed an object \u2018in a secondary, derivative sense\u2019\n(ibid.). On the other hand, in the shallow-tree analysis of Q et al., Anything you don\u2019t\neat would be the only object of put, although in a marked position, and no gap would\nbe needed.\n8 Present and preterite modal auxiliaries\nThe last controversial topic I will pick out is that of present-tense and preterite modals,\none of the topics of chapter 3, which in general offers rich, thorough, and revealing\nanalyses of the syntax and semantics of the verb. H&P regard the present and preterite\nforms of the modals as forming a single lexeme: hence there are four central modals\nonly: can, may, shall, and will (with one or two extra ones without present\/preterite\nalternation).21 I see this as illustrating once again H&P\u2019s seeking clear-cut solutions\nand also simplifying the grammatical interface of the lexicon. After all, it is simpler and\nmore regular to have a grammar with four-plus modals alternating between present and\npreterite inflections, than one with nine or so modals, with can, could, etc. as separate\nlexemes.\nBut obviously the truth lies somewhere between these two solutions \u2013 in some\nrespects the \u2018preterite\u2019 modals are analogous in form and meaning to the \u2018present-\ntense\u2019 forms, but in other respects they are totally different. Furthermore, they are\ninflectionally extremely irregular or defective, and their \u2018preterite\u2019 forms have senses\nwhich are unparalleled by the present-tense form. This is particularly the case with\nshould \u2013 a recent corpus study of this modal revealed that less than 5 per cent of\nshoulds could be semantically considered to be past\/remote forms of shall (Leech,\n2003: 233). The same study showed that shall has declined in frequency by about 40\nper cent in BrE and AmE between 1961 and 1991, so that shall is roughly four times\nless frequent than should even in written English \u2013 while in speech it is becoming\na rarity, particularly in AmE. As H&P admit (p. 196), the past forms of the modals\ncontrast markedly with the preterites of other verbs, in that their use to express modal\nremoteness is far more common than their use for past time, while with other verbs the\nsituation is completely the opposite. Furthermore, modally remote (i.e. hypothetical,\ntentative) uses of the preterite modals can occur in reference to nonpast time without\nobvious constraint: We might see her tomorrow contrasts in this respect with *We liked\nto see her tomorrow.\nOver a long period of history, the past-form modals have diverged from their present-\ntense analogues to the stage where it finally makes little sense to call one the preterite\nform and the other the present form. Most of the generalizations one can make about\nthe preterite in English do not apply to these words. On the other hand, it would also be\nwrong to claim that there is now no relatedness between the present and preterite forms.\n21 H&P use bold italics in citing a lexeme in abstraction from its inflectional forms. Thus can, here, subsumes\nboth can and could (and also can\u2019t and couldn\u2019t \u2013 since H&P consider the reduced negative n\u2019t to be a suffix,\nnot a clitic).\n142 G E O F F R E Y L E E C H\nThe divergence, arising partly through the gradual process of grammaticalization, is\nstill in progress, and I maintain that it would be better if the two possible analyses, each\nwith its strong and weak points, were acknowledged.\nHere I focus particularly on would, which H&P (given their stance on would as the\npreterite ofwill) take to be semantically analogous to the present formwill. Accordingly\nH&P reject the \u2018mood marker\u2019 meaning (Q et al. p. 234) wherebywould simply conveys\nhypotheticalness without expressing any of the predictive (epistemic) or volitional\nsenses of will. This means that for H&P, there is no modally remote equivalent of the\nsimple present, as in (24):\n(24) If she\u2019s here, she\u2019s in her office. (OPEN CONDITION) (example 17v on p. 742)\nInstead, H&P argue (p. 752) that the hypothetical would of (25) is the modally remote\nequivalent of (26), with will in the apodosis:\n(25) If she was\/were here, she would be in her office. (REMOTE CONDITION)\n(26) If she\u2019s here, she will be in her office. (OPEN CONDITION)\nInterestingly, the simple-present protasis in (24) and (26) is the most common type,\ntensewise, in if conditions, and the most common apodosis following it has the simple\npresent again, as in (24) (with thewill apodosis in (26) being the second most common).\nSo H&P give us no hypothetical equivalent of the most common type of open condition.\nIt is also noticeable that the time reference of (25) is most likely to be unrestricted\npresent, like that of (24), whereas the time reference of (26) is more oriented to the\nfuture.22\nTable 3. Comparison of H&P and Q et al. on the hypothetical use\nof would\nHuddleston\n& Pullum:\nOPEN REMOTE\nQuirk et al:\n(implicit)\nOPEN REMOTE\nSimple pres. (NONE) Simple pres.\nwould + V\nwill + V would + V will + V\nThe positions in table 3 are those taken by H&P (p. 752) and Q et al. (pp. 228\u201335);\nhowever, as often happens, Q et al. are less explicit than they could be on this matter.\nEssentially, Q et al.\u2019s position is that sometimes would behaves like the preterite of will,\nand sometimes not.\nHowever, H&P appear to contradict their own position and to go over to Q et al.\u2019s\nposition (on p. 748) when they give (28) as the remote equivalent of (27):\n(27) If you are under 18 you need parental approval.\n(28) If you were under 18 you would need parental approval.\n22 The future use of epistemic will appears to be much more common than the present (\u2018predictability\u2019) one \u2013 see\nCoates (1983: 171).\nA N E W G R AY \u2019 S A NATO M Y O F E N G L I S H G R A M M A R 143\nThere are other arguments involving infrequency and marginal acceptability. The\nperfect will have + p.p. is infrequent (see note 23 below), and cannot easily be regarded\nas the counterpart of the past remote construction:\n(29) If I said that, I was telling a lie. (OPEN CONDITION \u2013 PAST)\n(30) If I\u2019d said that, I\u2019d have been telling a lie. (REMOTE CONDITION \u2013 PAST)\n(31) If I said that, I\u2019ll have been telling a lie. (OPEN CONDITION \u2013 PAST)\nIt is entirely natural and reasonable to regard (30) as the remote (counterfactual)\nequivalent of (29). But H&P\u2019s nonremote version of (30) would be (31), substituting\nwill have + p.p., and thus replacing the preterite by an infrequent construction23 which\nvery rarely occurs in any if conditional. In fact (31) seems to be only marginally\nacceptable.\nNow consider some other constructions where the simple present-tense construction\ncorresponds to would + infinitive. Do you mind (if ) . . . .? is a form of indirect request,\nbut it is also possible to make the request more tentative and polite by using hypothetical\nwould: Would you mind (if )?24 A corpus search I carried out (using the BNC) showed,\nunsurprisingly, that these two alternatives are vastly more common than Will you mind\n(if )? Moreover, the option with will was not, in the BNC corpus data, an indirect\nrequest, but rather a question about the addressee\u2019s future feelings, as in Will you\nmind dining alone? Similarly, I suggest and I would suggest are common ways of\nintroducing the speaker\u2019s opinion, one more tentative than the other. But I will suggest\nis uncommon, and is not used for that purpose (again, this is based on a BNC search).\nAnother example: It seems that . . . and It would seem are both common, but It will\nseem occurs with microscopic frequency in the BNC.25\n9 Frequency\nMy arguments above for the implausibility of H&P\u2019s position onwill and would depend\nconsiderably on frequency, and this is something that needs clarification. I maintain that\ninformation about frequency can be important for a descriptive grammar \u2013 particularly\nfor its more practical applications, e.g. in language teaching and NLP \u2013 although there is\na popular theoretical argument that frequency is irrelevant to grammar, since frequency\nis a matter of the use of the grammar rather than of the grammar itself. It is indicative\nof H&P\u2019s position being more towards the \u2018theoretical\u2019 end of the spectrum of figure 1\nthat they have little use for frequency, although they mention facts of frequency from\ntime to time.26 This means they fail to give frequency information useful to the user\n23 In a random 740 examples from the written BNC, only one will + Perfect apodosis occurred. (There were 14\nother modal + Perfects, including 6 of could \u2013 Costas Gabrielatos, personal communication.)\n24 In the BNC, Do you mind occurs 204 times, Would you mind 124 times, and Will you mind 5 times.\n25 In the BNC, It seems occurs 2,694 times, It would seem 279 times, and It will seem twice.\n26 Although H&P occasionally risk frequency statements, these cannot always be trusted. For example, H&P\nclaim (p.1594) that for nouns like virtuoso \u2018the regular plurals are much more frequent than the foreign ones\n144 G E O F F R E Y L E E C H\nof the language, such as the fact that short (or agentless) passives are more than four\ntimes as frequent as long passives.27\nAlthough advocating frequency information drawn from corpora as an input to\ndescriptive grammar, I would not go as far as to argue that acceptability or non-\nacceptability in the language can be determined solely by presence or absence of\nphenomena in a corpus. Of course, the contexts in which grammatical forms occur\nneed to be inspected: a corpus can contain aberrant forms, dialect forms, etc. On the\nother hand, if a corpus shows a grammatical phenomenon as occurring a considerable\nnumber of times, in contexts which suggest normal usage, it is reasonable to take this\nas evidence for its acceptability. The negative side of this is that if a form does not\noccur, or occurs with extreme infrequency, in a large and representative corpus such\nas the BNC, conclusions as to the currency of that form can reasonably be drawn: the\nevidence of the corpus invites such an explanation. More generally, as in the examples\nabove relating to would, more extreme indications of frequency or infrequency can add\nto or detract from the plausibility of an analysis. The modals are one area of grammar\nwhere great differences of frequency are observable, and where changes particularly\nin the direction of infrequency have recently been taking place (Leech, 2003). It is an\nomission, from this point of view, that H&P do not mention the often-noticed low (and\ndeclining) frequency ofmay in the sense of permission, and underplay the obsolescence\nof shall in the \u2018condescending\u2019 sense of You shall have your money back tomorrow\n(p. 194).28\nStill on the modals, but turning to their negative forms, H&P note the virtual\ndisappearance of mayn\u2019t and the rarity of shan\u2019t, but it is also worth noting the extreme\nrarity of mustn\u2019t, mightn\u2019t, and needn\u2019t in spoken AmE. In fact, I found no examples of\nneedn\u2019t in the 2.5-million-word corpus of American conversation used in Biber et al.\n(1999). Ignoring more extreme cases of infrequency can distort a descriptive account\nof the language. For example, on a point about scope of negation in reference to modal\nneed, H&P make the claim \u2013 scarcely tenable in view of its lack of attestation in spoken\nAmE \u2013 that You needn\u2019t attend the lectures is \u2018perfectly acceptable to all speakers\u2019\n(p. 183). H&P can scarcely be blamed for omitting frequency findings which are only\njust emerging from current research, but the modals are a special case where current\ndecline in frequency usage leads to marginalization particularly of the already less\nfrequent modals shall, need, ought, and to a lesser extent must and may (Leech, 2003).\nin i\u2019. However, in the 100-million-word British National Corpus (BNC) virtuosos occurs only 4 times and\nvirtuosi 17 times.\n27 A comparison with Q et al. on the issue of frequency will reveal that, while Q et al. give more attention to\nfrequency than H&P, most of their frequency statements suffer from vagueness, words like \u2018often\u2019, \u2018sometimes\u2019,\nand \u2018rarely\u2019 being heavily used. An excuse for this, in the 1980s, was that corpora were less developed and\ngrammatical frequency investigations were more difficult to conduct. This lack of reliable frequency data\nwas remedied to a considerable extent in Biber et al. (1999), a corpus-based wide-coverage grammar using\nvirtually the same descriptive apparatus as Q et al. In this sense, Q et al. is frequentially complemented by Biber\net al.\n28 Coates (1983: 191) found no examples of this in her extensive corpus study of both written and spoken BrE.\nA N E W G R AY \u2019 S A NATO M Y O F E N G L I S H G R A M M A R 145\nAgainst this background, a grammatical description which largely ignores frequency\ncan give a false impression of uniformity in the language system, as I argue H&P do\nin the case of the modals.\n10 Terminology\nAs already hinted, this grammar carries a heavy weight of terminology, which is\noften new and difficult. But first, two positive things about H&P\u2019s terminology are\n(a) its admirable consistency of use, and (b) its language independence. By language\nindependence, I mean that H&P, as a matter of policy, avoid terminology which is tied to\nthe English language, and could not be used of a comparable grammatical phenomenon\nin another language (see p. 83 note). Some choices of new terms \u2013 such as the \u2018present\nfuturate\u2019 for the use of the present tense in reference to the future \u2013 are to be welcomed,\nas is also the rehabilitation of \u2018preterite\u2019 in preference to the ambiguous use of \u2018past\u2019\nto refer to tense, as well as to time reference.\nToo often, however, the attempt to use a precise and non-language-specific\nterminology leads to cumbersome obscurity. The by-phrase with passives is given\nthe obscure and unspecific label \u2018internalised complement\u2019. Instead of the simple\nterm ing-form, or ing-participle, H&P use the composite term \u2018gerund-participle\u2019.\nInstead of wh-forms orwh-words, they prefer the term \u2018unbounded dependency words\u2019.\nOther familiar terms incorporating English words, such as if-clauses and that-clauses,\ndisappear at least in part for descriptive reasons: for H&P, if-clauses become phrases,\nand that-clauses are simply declarative content clauses which have been \u2018expanded\u2019\nby the addition of that. Acceptably enough, instead of the were-subjunctive, the term\n\u2018irrealis\u2019 is used.\nSome divergences between Q et al. and H&P are purely fortuitous. The concepts of\n\u2018end focus\u2019 and \u2018end weight\u2019 in Q et al. are well described by H&P, but without using\nthose terms. Talking of the linear position of adjuncts, H&P use \u2018central\u2019 rather than\nQ et al.\u2019s \u2018medial\u2019. \u2018Preposing\u2019 is used for Q et al.\u2019s \u2018fronting\u2019, although \u2018PP fronting\u2019\nis used for the pied-piping construction. Whereas H&P use \u2018finite\u2019 and \u2018nonfinite\u2019 for\nclauses, they switch to \u2018primary\u2019 and \u2018secondary\u2019 as terms for Q et al.\u2019s finite and\nnonfinite verbs.\nIn other cases, the choice of unfamiliar and sometimes verbose terminology appears\nto be descriptively motivated. Among such cases is the distinction between \u2018integrated\u2019\nand \u2018supplementary\u2019 relative clauses \u2013 corresponding to, but conceptually different\nfrom, \u2018restrictive\/non-restrictive\u2019 or \u2018defining\/non-defining\u2019 clauses in Q et al. and\nelsewhere. The term \u2018phrasal verb\u2019 is not used, as all such verb+particle constructions\ncome under H&P\u2019s definition of \u2018prepositional verbs\u2019. The term \u2018nonassertive\u2019 in Q et al.\nis replaced by \u2018non-affirmative\u2019 (p. 60) or more lengthily by \u2018negatively-oriented\npolarity-sensitive items\u2019 (PPIs for short), which contrast with \u2018positive-oriented PPIs\u2019\n(largely ignored by Q et al.).\n146 G E O F F R E Y L E E C H\n11 Conclusion\nThese and many other differences between the terminologies of H&P and Q et al.\ndemonstrate in no uncertain terms that these are very different ways of \u2018doing grammar\u2019,\navailable to be consulted and studied by different bodies of students, teachers, and\nresearchers. In fact, going back to the cline of grammar in figure 1, there is a\ndiglossia in the dialect of grammatical discourse \u2013 pre-existing but accentuated by\nthe publication of H&P\u2019s monumental volume. In fact, of course, there are many\noverlapping terminologies: one might argue for \u2018triglossia\u2019, thinking of the vast\ngrammatical user-community of TEFL, where (for example) the progressive aspect\nis replaced by the \u2018continuous tenses\u2019. But the divergent terminologies of H&P and\nQ et al. also reflect a pronounced fault-line across the cline of theory-description-\nobservation in figure 1. In the final analysis, these two books present much of the same\ninformation, but packaged in a very different way. The serious student of grammar,\nalthough likely to be annoyed by terminological discrepancies, will continue to learn\nfrom both.\nAuthor\u2019s address:\nDepartment of Linguistics and Modern English Language\nLancaster University\nLancaster LA1 4YT\ng.leech@lancaster.ac.uk\nReferences\nAdger, D.
