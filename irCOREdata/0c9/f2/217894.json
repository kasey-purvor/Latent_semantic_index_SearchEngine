The first \ngeneration of research into the coercive measures of colonial states tended to focus \nrather narrowly on imprisonment. The second generation, which has emerged only in \nthe last five years, has significantly widened their field of vision to incorporate much \nmore than the prison. The most recent literature considers capital and corporal \npunishment, as well as the larger functioning of police and courts. It also explores in \nmore depth the ways in which indigenous peoples experienced and interpreted their \npunishments. Finally, this new research is sensitive to the paradoxes and tensions of \ncolonial punishment, which often frustrated its purposes. This article reflects upon \nthese historiographical shifts, and argues that, in light of these developments, a new \nframework for the study of colonial punishment is now called for. It suggests that an \napproach which views colonial coercive techniques as part of imperial \u2018coercive \nnetworks\u2019 encapsulates this new thinking.    \n \n 2 \n \nThe violence of the colonial condition has long been a central theme in debates \nabout the nature of imperialism. And yet, the colonial state\u2019s techniques of coercion \nhave only come under serious scholarly scrutiny in the last two decades. Since the \nmid-1980s we have come to know a great deal more about the workings of colonial \nprisons and penal colonies; scholarship on corporal and capital punishment has \nbegun to accumulate as well. In this fairly short time, two quite distinctive generations \nof scholarship have developed. The first, directly influenced by Michel Foucault\u2019s \nDiscipline and Punish, undertook a series of detailed studies of colonial prisons and \npenal colonies. The second generation, which has only emerged in the past five \nyears, is less overtly aligned with Foucault\u2019s study of prisons, and has significantly \nwidened the scope of the study of punishment. To discuss these developments, the \nfollowing pages are divided into three parts. The first section sketches the broad \noutlines of the first generation of scholarship. The second section begins by \ndiscussing some of the places in which this corpus of research left something to be \ndesired. It then considers the ways in which the second generation of scholarship is \nbreaking new ground. The article concludes by proposing a new framework for the \nstudy of colonial punishment \u2013 the coercive network \u2013 and then indicating areas for \nfurther research which have been opened up by the recent historiographical shifts.  \n \nI \n \nThe first generation to examine colonial punishment in its own right tended to \nconcentrate on the study of colonial prisons and penal colonies in Asia, Africa, South \nAmerica, the Caribbean, and the Indian Ocean.2 While building on earlier histories of \nlegal systems and crime in the colonies, this group of historians tended to take fresh \ninspiration from the theoretical interventions of the late 1970s and early 1980s made \nby Michel Foucault and the Subaltern Studies School of historians of South Asia.3 \n 3 \nThe former promised a new understanding of power, whilst the latter held out the \nprospect of accessing the histories of the most humble members of colonised \nsocieties. Both suggested that an examination of the prison would offer key insights. \nThe historians who responded to these interventions have produced a body of work \nwhich has now grown to a point where it is possible to see the broad outlines of \nagreement and debate within it. Interestingly, the scholar of prisons under British rule \nin India or East Africa will find little that is utterly unfamiliar in places of incarceration \nfrom French Indochina to New Spain. This section makes a thematic survey of this \nliterature by concentrating on four common themes: labour, medicine, surveillance \nand classification. While sketching out the broad trends in the scholarship, the \nfollowing pages also underscore the areas in which the colonial prison threw up \nunique contradictions, and the ways in which these everyday practices tied into larger \nimperial concerns.  \n \nConvict labour was the principle method of both punishment and reform of prisoners, \nbut it was also a means of reducing the costs of punishment. Because of this \ntripartite role, there were significant differences in the practices of penal labour both \nbetween colonies, and within them. Large penal colonies tended to employ a high \npercentage of convicts on a wide range of duties. On the mainland, central \npenitentiaries, where they existed, tended to have a more steady population and \nmore funding, and were therefore often better equipped for labour than district gaols \nwhere inmates were far less likely to be formally occupied, even in unskilled work. \nAcross the European empires prison regimes were often characterised by a system \nof labour which was designed primarily to suit the needs of the colonial power. \nIndeed, convicts\u2019 work played a vital part in the physical process of colonising new \nterritories. Penal transportation not only delivered people to new lands, but then \nensured that convicts were employed on public works projects from road building to \nswamp clearing.4 In most places of confinement, however, the motivation behind the \n 4 \nlabour regime was the simple struggle for financial self-sufficiency. In penal colonies, \nIndian convicts were often employed in mundane jobs as barbers, clothes washers, \nand tradesmen, which corresponded to their caste.5 Similarly, female inmates in \nSenegal tended to be employed on cooking and cleaning duties inside the jails.6 \nThese practices cut down on the amount of paid labour which the prison had to \nemploy, but also served to reinforce gender hierarchies, and to reify social \ncleavages. \n \nThe colonial state was not the only beneficiary of these gratis services. In New Spain, \n\u2018wayward women\u2019, convicted of adultery or fornication, were sent to work in \n\u2018respectable\u2019 houses where they were meant to learn proper Christian habits. In this \nway, the wealthy of Mexico City obtained a regular supply of domestic servants at \nlittle cost.7 Two centuries later, young offenders in the Cape Colony in southern \nAfrica were \u2018apprenticed\u2019 to local farmers and dignitaries, particularly during periods \nwhen paid labour was scarce.8 In the same period, prisoners in Senegal and Vietnam \nwere hired out to private entrepreneurs to work in places as varied as mines and \nschools.9 Where paid workers were in short supply and the state sanctioned forced \nlabour, as in colonial Mexico and American-ruled Puerto Rico, not only were convicts \nsent to augment the meagre cadres of labourers, jails were used to house those who \nhad fled other forms of coercive labour.10 Convict labour thus exposed a tension \nbetween the reforming mission of punishment and the financial constraints of imperial \neconomies geared towards extraction from their colonies. These practices can be \nseen, therefore, as integral parts of larger systems of forced migration and coerced \nlabour that sustained imperial economies.11  \n \nBecause of its manifold functions, penal labour was tied to several other aspects of \nthe prison. As ill inmates did not work, penal labour relied on colonial medicine. \nPrisoners\u2019 bodies became sites at which convicts and administrators employed \n 5 \nmedicine in the contest over whether or not an individual would be made to work on \nany given day.12 Whilst it was integral to labour regimes, medicine entered the prison \nout of curiosity as well as necessity. Prisons provided one of the few places where \nphysicians had access to the bodies of the colonised. As in Europe, prisoners were \namongst the first to be subjected to autopsy after death. Indian jails were also the \nsetting for early experiments in plague and smallpox vaccination, and in the use of \nquinine to prevent malaria.13 In these practices, the medical imperative seemed to \ndovetail with the penal one, as prisoners often regarded these procedures as \npunishment.  \n \nAt the same time, the focus on prisoners\u2019 health also introduced new tensions. \nImperial powers repeatedly struggled to strike a balance between providing sanitary \nand healthy living conditions to prisoners while also avoiding the perception that \ninmates were not being properly punished because prison conditions were better \nthan life outside amongst the colonised population. While it was difficult to justify \nreducing rations or facilities, these concerns could serve to prevent improvements, \neven when conditions were condemned by observers.14 Prisons throughout the \ncolonised world, therefore, remained damp, dark and dirty places, and imprisonment \noften was tantamount to a sentence of death, or at least ill-health.15  \n \nThe system of warders in colonial penal systems was also closely tied to the financial \nimperatives which dictated labour policy. European warders were very rare, as the \npay and conditions were unattractive. Instead, local warders \u2013 including convicts \u2013 \nwere often preferred because they had the linguistic capabilities necessary to \ncommunicate with the inmates.16 In spite of its financial and practical advantages, \nthis practice had more than a few shortcomings. Warders often failed to maintain a \nsharp distinction between rulers and ruled because, first of all, the same individuals \ncould often be found on both sides of the line.17 In British India and East Africa it was \n 6 \ncommon for convicts to be rewarded for good behaviour by being placed as \nwarders.18 Conversely, in French Upper Volta, free warders were punished for \ntransgressions with short terms of imprisonment.19 Secondly, warders, whether free \nor not, were notorious for extortion and corruption, for smuggling, and for routine \nviolence in jails.20 Their activities contributed to the sense that the prison walls were \nporous, as they acted as conduits between inmates and the world of goods and \npeople on the outside. Because prisoners and warders often had more in common \nthan warders and their European superiors in the colonial administration, they tended \nto create their own \u2018customary order\u2019 inside the jail walls.21 In this relatively \nautonomous social domain sex was a key site of negotiation for women, boys and \nmen in their interactions with warders.22 This customary order had a different \ncharacter in Burma, however, where the use of Indian wardens to supervise Burmese \ninmates exacerbated racial animosities between the two.23 Situated on the edge of \ntwo worlds, warders epitomise the ambiguity of colonial violence for they reveal the \nextent to which many of the colonial state\u2019s coercive mechanisms relied on a small \nnumber of the colonised population who, reluctantly, willingly, or cunningly, were \ninstruments of colonial dominance. \n \nWarders were not the only part of the carceral system which performed below \nexpectations. Though nearly all colonial governments elaborated detailed rules on \nthe classification and segregation of different types of prisoners, many colonial prison \nsystems failed to implement these regulations. Those that made a partial effort often \nserved not merely to separate women, remand prisoners, juveniles and condemned \nprisoners, as was the case in Europe and North America.24 They also underscored \nracial differences between the colonisers and the colonised and bolstered social \ndivisions amongst inmates from the local population. Throughout the European \nempires, prison regimes enforced a racial hierarchy in which European prisoners \nwere almost universally offered better living conditions than the members of the \n 7 \ncolonised population with whom they were imprisoned. Bernault has argued that, in \nAfrica, racial distinction was maintained in three ways: by the separation of European \nprisoners, by the de-individuation of black inmates, and by the maintenance of \nsignificantly lower living standards for the latter.25 Similarly, in Indian prisons \nEuropean convicts enjoyed separate living quarters and better food, including regular \nquantities of meat and milk; they had the right to wear their own clothes, to have \nbetter reading facilities, including lights, and to receive and write more letters than \nordinary Indian inmates.26 Existing research suggests that these privileges were \nreplicated across much of the colonised world.27 Two interesting exceptions were \ncolonial Natal and the Cape Colony in South Africa. In the Cape, neither prisoners \nnor children in reformatories were segregated on racial lines until the 1890s.28 In \nNatal, Europeans enjoyed better food in jail, but were housed together with African \nand Indian prisoners.29  \n \nRacially-defined classification systems were further complicated by the introduction of \nprivileges based on the class of local convicts. In Belgian and Portuguese Africa, \nWestern-educated Africans were granted separate quarters in jails.30 By contrast, in \nIndia, where prisoners were classed according to their social status and mode of \nliving outside jail, the few wealthy Indian prisoners who had European habits were \nhoused in the European ward.31 These practices seemed to reify class differences \namongst the colonised. During India\u2019s nationalist movement, for example, middle-\nclass Indians who had been imprisoned for participation in political movements and \nwere not treated as European prisoners frequently recorded the social differences \nwhich separated them from \u2018common criminals\u2019.32 Some used this distinction to \npetition the government for the privileges of Europeans.33 Of course, class was not \nthe only dividing line; caste and ethnic differences were sometimes integrated into \ncolonial penal systems. Whilst in French Africa there seems to have been little \nattempt to classify prisoners according to their ethnicity,34 in nineteenth century India \n 8 \nelaborate cooking and eating arrangements were instituted to cater to what the \nauthorities preferred to call \u2018caste prejudice\u2019.35 India\u2019s messing and living \narrangements were a combination of indigenous agency and a larger colonial system \nin which state institutions served to reify collective identities.36 In the colonial context, \nthe state rarely invented new categories ab initio, but it saw rigidity in caste, religious \nand ethnic differences which were not evident in practice. When it incorporated this \nview of inflexible collectives into its institutions, the colonial state could help to foster \nthese identities.37 \n \nThe prison was also used for more overtly political purposes. Because the European \nimperial powers tended to treat political dissent as criminal activity, the colonial prison \nwas often an integral part of the way in which they confronted indigenous collective \npolitical action. During the conquest of Africa, it was common for African leaders to \nbe imprisoned until they submitted to colonial rule.38 Caroline Elkins has exposed the \nmass detentions which the British resorted to in their battle against the Mau Mau \nrebellion in 1950s Kenya.39 The detention of thousands became a routine response \nto nationalism, revolutionary terrorism and communism in twentieth-century India.40 \nLarge scale detention without trial was also a feature of the fight against communists \nin British Malaya and French Indochina.41 Similarly, French Government forces swept \nthousands into jails and detention camps in their attempt to regain control of Algeria \nduring the French-Algerian war.42 These arrests regularly overwhelmed the ordinary \ncriminal justice systems, meaning that many simply languished in prison until the \ndisturbances had passed, without ever being tried or convicted in a court of law.  \n \nThe colonial state was unable to keep a monopoly on the use of the prison for \npolitical purposes, however. Indian nationalists deliberately courted imprisonment to \nprove that India was \u2018one vast prison\u2019. 43 Finding the daily regime inside \nunsatisfactory, they designed their own programmes of study, exercise and work to \n 9 \nprove they were capable of self rule. Ujjwal Kumar Singh has shown the ways in \nwhich the struggles for special status which were waged by political prisoners were \npart of the battle to define the legitimate bounds of Indian politics.44 Vietnamese \ncommunists took advantage of the communal living arrangements and lax discipline \nin the prisons of French Indochina to organise themselves, whilst the experiences of \npolitical prisoners in jails across the country helped create a sense of a Vietnamese \nnation.45 As everyday life in jails was woven into larger political choreographies the \nprison took a more prominent part in larger political calculations in the colonies than \nin the metropole.  \n \nA picture thus emerges of colonial prisons in which, despite many attempts at reform, \nviolence was common, labour was more concerned with profit than with discipline, \nand surveillance and segregation were impeded by the very warders who were \nmeant to oversee these functions. Although there were exceptions, the undisciplined \ncolonial prison could be found across the European empires from the seventeenth \ncentury to the twentieth century.  \n \nII \n \nAlthough this image of the undisciplined colonial prison is not in dispute, there were a \nnumber of shortcomings in this first generation of scholarship which cannot escape \nnotice. First, with a few notable exceptions, nearly all of these studies at least \nimplicitly relied on Michel Foucault\u2019s Discipline and Punish as a model against which \nto measure their own discoveries.46 Foucault\u2019s argument in the book is well known: \nhe asserted that, in the eighteenth and nineteenth century in France, various, usually \ncorporal, forms of punishment were eliminated in favour of the uniform, almost \negalitarian practice of imprisonment. With this, the focus of punishment shifted from \ncausing the criminal physical pain to teaching him self-discipline through a \n 10 \nregimented daily life of bathing, eating, exercise and work in jail. However, in \nfollowing so closely the model of Discipline and Punish, this generation has become \nlocked in an historiographical cul-de-sac. Many of those concerned with colonial \nprisons have noted that the disciplinary project which Foucault discerned in France \neither did not succeed, or did not follow the same course in the colony which they \nhave studied. This group, therefore, have concluded that colonial systems of \nconfinement were therefore \u2018pre-modern\u2019, or at best, a mix of modern and pre-\nmodern elements.47 On the other hand, there are a few who insist that the colonial \nprison was \u2018modern\u2019 because, in spite of its shortcomings, it was based on the same \nblueprint as the prison in Europe, and because it was a symbol of modernity.48 \n \nThis debate, based on one reading of Foucault\u2019s Discipline and Punish, obscures \nmore than it illuminates. Even when examining prisons, Foucault was concerned not \nwith their internal functioning, but rather, he explained, his method entailed \u2018going \nbehind the institution and trying to discover in a wider and more overall perspective \nwhat we can broadly call a technology of power\u2019.49 Therefore, Foucault was not \nbothered if prison discipline did not function as planned, and he had little interest in \ncreating \u2018an historical balance sheet\u2026of what was intended and what was actually \nachieved\u2019 in the institutions he studied.50 Indeed, he argued that the wider \u2018strategies \nand tactics\u2019 in which he was interested \u2018find support even in these functional defects \nthemselves\u2019.51 In other words, even the failure of prison discipline could prove his \nlarger point about technologies of power. Further, Foucault refuted the idea that there \nwas a clean division between pre-modern and modern forms of power.52 In the \npicture of governmentality that Foucault sketched, repression and discipline always \nexist as part of a larger equation.  \n \nThis is where Foucault\u2019s theory provides not a rigid model into which historians must \nstuff the facts we find, but a series of questions which can help one to use historical \n 11 \nevidence from studies of punishment to begin to define what might be termed a \nspecifically colonial governmentality.53 According to Foucault, the task of each \ngovernment is to calculate \u2018how to keep a type of criminality\u2026within socially and \neconomically acceptable limits and around an average that will be considered as \noptimal for a given social functioning\u2019. The question then is, on what basis is this \nbalance determined? Essentially the question is an economic one, Foucault answers, \nin which the cost (broadly conceived) of repression is weighed against the cost of \ndelinquency.54 Here the equation will be contingent upon innumerable local factors. \nHistorians of colonial punishment must therefore look beyond each individual practice \nof punishment to interrogate the larger structures and calculations which determined \nsystems of punishment in a given locality.  \n \nPart of this move must include a shift away from the colonial prison as a focus of \nresearch. The majority of published works in the first generation focused on this \nsingle institution and, following Foucault, asserted that, over the past two centuries, \nthe deprivation of liberty has replaced other forms of punishment. Although some \nscholars have noted the existence of alternate penal practices,55 they nonetheless \nhave left these other sanctions, which functioned in tandem with the prison, largely \nunexamined. As a result, both the importance of incarceration and the significance of \nthe disciplinary objectives of the colonial state have been overstated in this \nscholarship. \n \nIn recent years a small number of studies have begun to examine corporal and \ncapital punishment in their own right. Robert Turrell has explored the ways in which \nclass, race and gender affected conviction rates, capital sentences and \ncommutations in the years before the formal introduction of apartheid in South \nAfrica.56 Stacey Hynd has shown the ways in which competing political, \n 12 \nadministrative, legal, and cultural imperatives could impact the use of capital \npunishment in Kenya and Nyasaland.57  \n \nThere is also a growing body of research into the practice of flogging, particularly in \nAfrica.58 These works highlight the ways in which corporal punishment was intimately \ntied to understandings of race and to the control of labour.59 But not all of these \nauthors have avoided the same traps that befell scholars of the colonial prison. \nSeveral have argued that the persistence of flogging in the colonies proves that the \ncolonial penal regime retained \u2018pre-modern\u2019 elements.60 Moreover, these studies \ncontinue to focus on a single penal sanction, more or less in isolation, not only from \nthe police and courts, but from other practices of punishment.  \n \nIn the past few years, however, a second generation of research on colonial violence \nand punishment has emerged which is changing the face of scholarship. Three \nrecent books epitomise this new trend: Clare Anderson\u2019s The Indian Uprising of \n1857-8, Diana Paton\u2019s No Bond but the Law, and David Anderson\u2019s Histories of the \nHanged. These works all examine punishment not in isolation, but as a function of \nwider political, cultural, social, economic and administrative developments. Each is \nmore sensitive to the complexities of the experiences of the colonised peoples who \ncame into contact with the colonial criminal justice system. And all three of these \nauthors view the practices of punishment as part of larger matrices of colonial \ncoercion, and are attuned to the tensions within these systems. As with any division \nof this kind, there are of course a few works which do not fall neatly into one \ngeneration or the other, but the arrival of these three books heralds a significant \nchange in the field.61  \n \nThe first of these books, Clare Anderson\u2019s recent monograph, The Indian Uprising of \n1857-8: Prisons, Prisoners and Rebellion, makes several departures in the study of \n 13 \ncolonial confinement. This work is not only a detailed examination of the internal \nfunctioning of India\u2019s prisons in the nineteenth century, it also charts the ways in \nwhich imprisonment was transformed by the mutiny\/rebellion of 1857. Clare \nAnderson argues that attacks on North Indian jails during the uprising created a crisis \nin the larger colonial prison system, which, in turn, prompted a reconfiguring of that \nsystem. She demonstrates that, as colonial administrators sought to distribute \nprisoners in the aftermath of the revolt, penal transportation shifted from the more \nsettled areas of empire in the Straights settlements to newer imperial frontiers in \nBurma and the Andaman Islands. The book's second innovation is to analyse the \nexperiences of convicts in a more sophisticated fashion. She does more than simply \nregister moments of resistance; she uses Indian sources to understand the multiple \nand shifting meanings of confinement for prisoners.62 Before the uprising, she \nargues, prisons, with their alien eating, clothing and medical arrangements, were one \nof the sources of anxiety about colonial interference in Indian religious practices \nwhich prompted the revolt. After the revolt, which witnessed large-scale prison \nbreaking, and then massive imprisonment of rebels and mutineers, prisons had been \ntransformed into \u2018spaces of cultural confrontation\u2019.63 Anderson\u2019s analysis, with its \nunprecedented focus on Indian experiences of hardship and camaraderie, and the \nchanging meanings of confinement, breaks new ground as it establishes a cultural \nhistory of confinement.  \n \nThe second book, Diana Paton\u2019s No Bond but the Law: Punishment, Race and \nGender in Jamaican State Formation, 1780-1870, is a study of the ways in which the \nprocess of the abolition of slavery shaped the practices of both flogging and \nimprisonment in colonial Jamaica. She differs from the majority of the first generation \nof scholars, first of all, in that she is sensitive to the ways in which punishment in \nunfree societies must necessarily function differently from that in the more free \nsocieties of Europe and North America.64 She demonstrates that, before the abolition \n 14 \nof slavery, private punishments by slave owners coexisted with public punishment \nthrough imprisonment: owners sent their slaves to jails to be punished; and \nconversely, the prison system was used to penalise and return runaway slaves. Like \nClare Anderson, Paton charts the ways in which practices of punishment became \nsites on which larger struggles were contested. Thus, she interrogates the complex \nmotives behind nineteenth-century prison reforms on the island: white Jamaican \nplanters backed a more professional prison system as part of their efforts to prove to \nthe metropole that they were ready for self-government; those campaigning for the \nemancipation of slaves believed that the introduction of a modern prison regime was \ncentral to the reform and salvation of slave society. In the same vein, the latter group \ncalled for a ban on the flogging of women, as they hoped this would restore their \n\u2018natural\u2019 inclination to modesty, and therefore \u2018raise\u2019 their moral conduct. Finally, and \ncrucially, Paton is conscious of the ways in which corporal and carceral punishments \nwere intertwined in this period. Abolitionists hoped that a modern prison system could \nreplace flogging just as waged labour would replace forced labour. But when prison \nreforms were perceived to have failed, flogging was reinstated for men. However, the \nreintroduction of corporal punishment was accompanied by new regulations which \nstipulated that a judge must set a precise number of lashes to be inflicted, that the \nsize of the whip ought to be standardised and that a doctor must be present at each \nflogging. The standardisation and medicalisation of whipping, she argues, suggests \nthat \u2018violence and pain are fully part of modern power\u2019.65 By analysing non-carceral \nforms of punishment alongside imprisonment, and by situating practices of \npunishment within larger political and social configurations, Paton\u2019s work points to the \nmany ways in which the field of colonial punishment can break free from the model of \nEuropean and North American imprisonment.  \n \nThe final work under consideration is David Anderson\u2019s Histories of the Hanged: \nBritain\u2019s Dirty War in Kenya and the End of Empire. This book is not only a larger \n 15 \nhistory of Kenya through the mid-twentieth century, but a detailed analysis of the Mau \nMau rebellion (1952-1960), and of the whole array of government efforts to combat it. \nPerhaps because it is speaking to an audience beyond those who work on colonial \npunishment, this work marks a significant departure. First of all, it is keenly aware of \nthe ways in which different practices of punishment and state violence intersected \nwith capital punishment: physical violence was a routine part of the process of police \n\u2018investigations\u2019; in order to keep prosecution witnesses safe during trial, authorities \nthreatened communities with collective fines if witnesses should come to harm; those \nwho were acquitted in formal criminal trials were simply detained without trial after \nproceedings had concluded. The work is also attuned to the many severe \nshortcomings of Kenya\u2019s criminal justice system: police investigations were patchy \nand often arbitrary; courts and prisons were easily overwhelmed by the influx of new \ncases brought by the unrest; conditions in detention camps were appalling. Crucially, \nDavid Anderson is sensitive to the complexities of colonial violence. Physical \nviolence was not always formally executed, but was often committed by proxies and \nparamilitaries acting on their own accord. \u2018Excesses\u2019, whether by government \nservants or those with more tangential connections to the state, were often either \nexcused or ignored for the sake of keeping up morale. Finally, he notes that, \nalthough the Mau Mau rebellion was often portrayed as a race war, much of the \nviolence was perpetrated by Africans on Africans. David Anderson\u2019s book is the first \nto undertake a study of a colonial criminal justice system in all its complexities. His \ncomprehensive research shows just how different the colonial state appears when its \ncoercive practices are examined not as isolated institutions, but as part of a larger \nwhole.  \n \nIII \n \n 16 \nThese three books have done ground breaking work, and they have opened up \nseveral areas for further research. First, it is clear that the field is in need of a new \nconceptual framework. Foucault\u2019s Discipline and Punish provided fresh inspiration \ntwenty years ago, but it has long been clear that his model does not \u2018fit\u2019 in colonial \nAsia, Africa or Latin America. This does not mean that Foucault\u2019s larger oeuvre is \nirrelevant, of course, but the questions which frame our research must change. Just \nas colonial history has moved away from western models in many fields colonial \npunishment should too.66 To do this we must move beyond the idea that colonial \npenal tactics violated legal orders which were otherwise just; we must recognise that \nthey constituted systems of law which had little to do with the clich\u00e9d sense in which \nthe term \u2018rule of law\u2019 was often used by the imperial powers.  \n \nThere is much scope for examining the various colonial coercive institutions and \npractices in a single frame, and as a function of larger political, administrative, \neconomic, social and cultural processes. I prefer to think of this larger system of \ncolonial punishment as the \u2018coercive network\u2019 of the colonial state.67 This framework \nfor studying practices of punishment recognises that, far from being limited to a \nsingle institution, penal practices ranged from firing on crowds and bombing from the \nair, to dismissal from one\u2019s place of work or study, collective fines, confiscation of \nproperty, as well as imprisonment, corporal and capital punishment. It is also keenly \naware of the fact that sanctions were meted out not only by employees of the colonial \nstate acting through formal legal channels, but also by intermediaries, quasi-state \nactors, and private parties. Their actions, though often only tangentially related to the \nformal criminal justice system, were an integral part of the way in which imperial \npowers retained their hold over the colonised. Moreover, these sanctions were \nalways part of larger imperial agendas and strategies of rule which impacted the \nquotidian functioning of penal practices. The term coercive network is not meant to \nimply that the system was cohesive or coherent. Rather, it simply conveys the \n 17 \ninterlocking nature of the different penal sanctions. Indeed, it is clear that the \npractices which constituted coercive networks were defined not so much by discipline \nand regimentation, but by contradiction and the unpredictability which arose out of \nsystems replete with tensions. \n \nThe idea of the coercive network also suggests that, far from being a comprehensive \nand all-encompassing system, there were gaps in the net. And these shortcomings \nwere frequently used by the population to negotiate the terms of their own \npunishment. This approach therefore calls upon scholars to access indigenous \nvoices, and to employ indigenous sources in innovative ways, for, as Clare Anderson \nhas noted, indigenous sources are not as uncommon as has been supposed.68 It is \nclear that members of colonised populations imbued different penal sanctions with \ntheir own meanings. And these practices became embroiled in local politics which \ncould be quite autonomous from the colonial state and its objectives. Of course, \ncolonial violence was also central to anti-colonial movements, and this area of \nresearch, too, is ripe for further investigation. Such cultural history, which would \nexplore the meanings of violence and coercive practices, would greatly augment our \nunderstanding of the experience of colonialism.  \n \nThe coercive networks approach also calls for further examination of the fact that a \ngreat deal of colonial violence was actually perpetrated not by whites upon non-\nwhites, but by select members of the colonised population upon their colonised \nbrethren. Does this fact mean that large-scale, anti-colonial rebellions can be likened \nto civil wars, as David Anderson has suggested? Or is this a cruel irony of \nimperialism that must be defined on its own terms? Finally, if one keeps this fact in \nmind, one is led to note that practices of colonial punishment and state violence \ncarried on in the postcolonial world. The postcolonial legacy of colonial coercive \nnetworks clearly provides fertile ground for further research.  \n 18 \n \nRecent historiographical shifts have significantly broadened the study of colonial \npunishment. The present generation of scholarship as begun to uncover the ways in \nwhich violence and coercion were part of both larger imperial calculations and \nbroader political, administrative, social, economic and cultural shifts. This group of \nscholars have done more than the previous generation to understand the complex \nways in which colonised peoples interpreted and invested colonial coercion with \nmeaning. And they have begun to tease out the paradoxes, irrationalities, and \ntensions in colonial punishment. \n \n                                               \n1 I wish to thank Ricardo Roque and Stacey Hynd for their comments on an earlier version of \nthis piece. \n2 Whilst this article limits itself to the colonial context, there are excellent studies of the history \nof prisons outside of Europe and North America including, Ricardo D.
