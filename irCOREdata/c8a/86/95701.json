Men and women in combat clothing \u2013 \u2018battle fatigues\u2019 \u2013 with faces\ncovered in camouflage cream and sweat, carrying the weapons of war and\nportraying a hardness of heart and a gung-ho attitude.\nWearing body armour they are protected in close combat from the direct and\nindirect fire of the enemy; and when that fails the images switch to limbless and\nblooded victims surrounded by medics whose job it is to keep them alive as they\nwait for the helicopters to sweep in and carry them away to the field hospitals \u2013\nand then home to \u2018Blighty\u2019. Images of glory \u2013 parades, medals and speeches for our\nheroes.\nBut, behind the steel helmets and the hardened masks of courage lie individual\nhearts and minds struggling to come to terms with all that they have seen and\nheard; all that they have experienced. As I look into these images I see many\nquestions and few answers. If I didn\u2019t know they were soldiers I would struggle to\nplace them \u2013 indeed a first reaction might well be that they are actually dead, not\nalive; maybe university students caught up in the latest shooting. But their\nFigure 3. Soldier: Jefferson, Length of service unknown.\n872 Tim Cross\nclose-cropped hair perhaps gives them away, and there is life in at least some of\nthe eyes.\nLying on the hard floor they seem vulnerable. Amongst them I see a mixture\nof na\u00efve youth \u2013 wide eyed surprise \u2013 and hardened maturity. Some look intently\nand deeply into the camera; others avoid the lens, gazing into the distance with far\noff thoughts, lost in their own worlds. In most of them there is a mixture of grief\nand fear, hopelessness and anger. In some of the faces I sense an acknowledgement\nthat they couldn\u2019t take any more.\nWhilst one or two of the gazes are steely, most are dead-eyed. Stripped of their\nprotection and their friends, these soldiers are now alone. Alone to face up to the\nevents that they have been through and the world that they have returned to \u2013 a\nworld that will have little or no comprehension of what they have experienced.\nIn Figure 3, I see suspicion and a resentment of all that has gone on; a\nsomewhat scornful stare into the camera lens with eyes that have seen too much\nto be fooled by the speeches of the politicians and the trite words of those who sent\nthem away. In Figure 2 there is introspection \u2013 a heaviness of heart. Sad and\ntraumatised, the eyes looking down and refusing to engage with the camera as she\nreflects on memories of people and events perhaps best forgotten.\nBut both of these images stand in contrast to Figure 1. Here I sense a slight\nsmile of satisfaction, of contentment. Deep in sleep, bone tired but a job worth\ndoing has been well done. Glad to be home \u2013 maybe he has found something\nwithin himself that he hoped would be there but only the ultimate test of battle\nwould confirm. There is contentment here; contentment not reflected in the other\nimages.\nOver the 36 years of my commissioned service I deployed on several operations;\nNorthern Ireland in the 1970s, Cyprus in 1981 with the United Nations, three times\nin the Balkans in the mid-late 1990s, and Kuwait and Iraq in the 1990\/91 and 2003.\nOperating as we now do in a fully professional Army, the vast majority of the\npeople living in Western democracies have no personal links into the military; most\nseem to assume that soldiers are unthinking automatons, keen for a fight and\nuncaring of the consequences. The reality is far from that.\nIt has been said that the young men and women who end up in places like Iraq\nare a mixture of missionaries, mercenaries and misfits; and there is some truth in\nthat. Words like honour, duty and integrity certainly mean far more to them than\nmost, and for many the military is the one place where they find true friendship.\nAs James Elroy Flecker\u2019s poem puts it: \u2018Go out as a pilgrim, and seek out danger\n. . . pit your very soul against the unknown and seek stimulation in the company\nof the brave.\u2019 Clothed in the outward equipment given them to wear in battle, they\nare trained to try to become what the image portrays; hard and tough. But take\naway the paraphernalia of war and you are often left with an individual trained to\nwear a mask; and too often not trained to cope when the mask slips or is stripped\naway.\nMost of the soldiers I have commanded over the years are good people \u2013 some\nare the best I have ever come across. From patrolling the streets in counter\ninsurgency operations, to fighting their way into places like Iraq, to dealing with\nthe humanitarian fallout of what we now call \u2018Complex Emergencies\u2019, they have\nresponded with humanity and humour to whatever has faced them. But they too\nask the questions that others outside of the military ask. Questions like: \u2018Why?\u2019 or:\nResponses to images by Suzanne Opton 873\n\u2018What is this all about?\u2019 or: \u2018How can people be so brutal to one another?\u2019 or:\n\u2018Where now?\u2019\nWhen they return home they are left with the memories of failure and violence,\ndeath and injury, as well as the successes and the moments where they have\nindividually and collectively made a difference to the lives of those caught up in the\nmaelstrom of war. For some \u2013 indeed many \u2013 the experiences build and enhance,\nbringing confidence and a sense of justice and righteousness. But for many others the\nmemories become too much; and too often they are left to pick up the pieces alone.\nHow many of the young men and women shown in these images will find\nthemselves locked in depression and loneliness \u2013 abandoned, along with many\nothers, by the very nation that sent them off to war in the first place? We may\nnever know; but it is a question worth asking \u2013 unnerving though it might be.\ndoi:10.1017\/S0260210509990271\nPortraits of war\nNICK VAUGHAN-WILLIAMS\nSuzanne Opton\u2019s \u2018Soldiers\u2019 consists of seventeen black and white and twelve\nlarge-scale colour portraits of serving US military personnel. Each soldier has\nrecently returned from Iraq or Afghanistan and is on leave, awaiting redeployment,\nat the Fort Drum Military Base near the New York-Canada border. The\nphotographs reproduced here are of Soldier Pry (\u2018210 days in Afghanistan\u2019, 2005),\nSoldier Morris (\u2018100 days in Iraq\u2019, 2005) and Soldier Jefferson (details unknown).\nIn an interview about the series, Opton talks about her difficulty accessing the\nsoldiers at the base: \u2018They asked, \u201cIs this a political project?\u201d I said, \u201cNo, this is\nart\u201d\u2019.1 Elsewhere, she writes: \u2018We all experience strategic moments when we feel\nmost alive. These are the moments we will always remember, be they transcendent\nor horrific. After all, what are we if not our collection of memories? In making\nthese portraits of soldiers, I simply wanted to look in the face of someone who\u2019d\nseen something unforgettable\u2019.2 However, despite the apparent simplicity of her\nstated aims and the distinction she draws between art and politics, Opton\u2019s series\ninevitably raises many difficult ethical-political questions about war photography\nand subjectivity as well as post-9\/11 US military adventurism.\nAccording to Susan Sontag, war photography has typically focused on \u2018the ruin\nof faces [. . .]: the faces of horribly disfigured World War One veterans who\nsurvived the inferno of the trenches; the faces melted and thickened with scar tissue\nof survivors of the American atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki;\nthe faces cleft by machete blows of Tutsi survivors of the genocidal rampage\nlaunched by the Hutus in Rwanda\u2019.3 If Opton\u2019s aim is to grapple with the\ntransformative experiences of war then it is interesting that she should choose such\n1 K.

Sontag, Regarding the Pain of Others (London: Penguin, 2003), p. 74.\n874 Nick Vaughan-Williams\nordinary and visibly unscarred faces that could be almost anyone: \u2018the everyman\nsoldier\u2019.4 Other than the men\u2019s cropped hair and some glimpses of Soldier Pry\u2019s\nstandard-issue green US army t-shirt, there is little to suggest that these are serving\nmembers of the armed forces. Indeed, the absence of weapons, uniforms and other\nmilitary regalia challenges conventional images of soldiers as portrayed in both the\nstiff formalism of official mug-shots and action heroism of field journalism.\nOn the one hand, this move could be criticised for sanitising warfare by\nrendering invisible the pain and suffering of those caught up in conflict in whatever\ncapacity. On the other hand, by refusing rote ways of drawing attention to and\nprovoking discussion about war, the affective impact of Opton\u2019s series is arguably\nmore hard-hitting. Indeed, if Sontag\u2019s claim that the \u2018mounting level of acceptable\nviolence and sadism in mass culture\u2019 has led to a desensitisation of war imagery\namong populations is correct, then perhaps the power of Opton\u2019s work lies in its\ndeliberately understated and thought-provoking approach.5\nAlthough Opton wants \u2018the public to see the impact of war on a young person\u2019s\nface\u2019, \u2018Soldiers\u2019 nevertheless refuses a single narrative or coherent message: the\nexpressions of her subjects do not clearly convey a particular story either\nindividually or collectively.6 Rather, we are left questioning: What have they seen?\nHow have they been affected? Is Soldier Morris staring down because she is\nashamed, remorseful or simply bored? Are Soldier Pry\u2019s eyes closed because he is\nat peace or playing dead? Does Soldier Jefferson\u2019s gaze reflect vengefulness or\nsadness or both? Moreover, the unusual horizontal positioning of each head extends\nand further complicates the range of possible interpretations: \u2018From this vantage\npoint\u2019, Opton comments, \u2018the head becomes a single object. I meant the head to be\nisolated and vulnerable, and for the soldiers to forget that a camera was trained on\nthem\u2019.7 Here the reference to vulnerability is potentially helpful: the pictures achieve\na sense of nudity and expose faces otherwise concealed beneath head-gear. We\nshare an unusual degree of intimacy with these soldiers because from this angle,\none that is reminiscent of lying in bed next to someone, their guard is down.\nYet, at the same time, what makes this perspective also somewhat disturbing is\nthe implicit reference to injury and even death: literally the portrayal of a \u2018fallen\nsoldier\u2019 in the case of Pry whose complexion and expression is corpse-like. Again,\nan array of diverse, even contradictory, readings can be identified: Is this simply\na sentimental and patriotic \u2018remember our boys (and girls)\u2019 campaign? Or,\nalternatively, could it act as a reminder of our own proximity to and complicity in\nthe sanctioning of warfare? Whilst it is ultimately unclear what specific response\n\u2018Soldiers\u2019 seeks to mobilise, it is a series that nevertheless demands us to stop and\nexamine our own consciences about the consequences of war on individuals\u2019 lives.\nIn this way the photographs are confrontational and, despite Opton\u2019s commentary,\nprofoundly politicising: her exposure of the vulnerable faces of soldiers lays bare\nthe human foundations and consequences of conflict. Our own responses elicited\nby these faces become the centre of attention and it is at this point that the\ndistinction between art and politics breaks down.\n4 Nagey and Stocke, \u2018The Human Faces of War\u2019.\n5 Sontag, Regarding the Pain of Others, p. 90.\n6 Nagey and Stocke, \u2018The Human Faces of War\u2019.\n7 Ibid.\nResponses to images by Suzanne Opton 875\ndoi:10.1017\/S0260210509990283\nPublic\/private, connected\/disconnected\nCYNTHIA WEBER\nChapter I of Suzanne Opton\u2019s photographic series \u2018Soldier\u2019 is at first glance an\narresting commentary on the effects of military service in Iraq on individual US\nsoldiers. Shot in varying degrees of close-up, the series is composed of nine\nindividual head and neck shots photographed in color, evoking traditional\nportraiture. Or, at least these images might evoke traditional portraiture if each\nwere turned ninety degrees counterclockwise. For each head appears sideways in\nthe frame, lying on a piece of parchment paper and at a slightly different height\nto the other heads in the series. The shots are predominantly lit from the top, so\nthat the top half of each soldier\u2019s head is illuminated while the bottom half is more\nin shadow. The background is completely dark. Each shot is captioned with the\nword \u2018Soldier:\u2019, followed by the soldier\u2019s surname.\nThere is nothing about these photographs that resembles the images of soldiers\nviewers regularly consume as portraits \u2013 uniformed, upright bodies, standing at\nattention in front of a flag, and looking directly into the camera. Laid side by side\nin a sequence, Opton\u2019s photographs might be the heads of fallen soldiers littering\na battlefield or on gurneys in a veterans\u2019 hospital, but only because we know these\nphotographs are of \u2018soldiers\u2019. Read without their captions, the images in Chapter\nI of Opton\u2019s project might as easily be photographs of any individuals. For neither\nflags or uniforms are found in any of these frames. All that might suggest some of\nthese individuals are soldiers are the occasionally closely cropped haircuts and 1000\nyard stares emblematic of modern military photography.\nOpton\u2019s aesthetic set-up in Chapter I takes viewers back and forth across a\nseries of paired terms, just as the viewer\u2019s eyes move back and forth across the two\ndifferently lit sides of each soldier\u2019s face. These dichotomies include safety\/danger,\npassive\/active, dead\/deadening, and bodily\/disembodied. The viewer cannot rest\neither their eyes or their minds on either side because both sides are so strongly\nrepresented at the same time. So viewers are left to wonder if each soldier is\ntrustingly resting their weary heads after a hard tour of duty on a parchment\npillow (safety) or if each soldier is sticking their neck out onto a chopping block,\nwith the parchment evoking the idea of the sacrificial lamb (danger). What are\nviewers to make of stationary heads (passive) with eyes that actively return or\nrefuse to return the gaze of the camera (active)? Are these images meant to conjure\nup the censored photographs of dead bodies of US soldiers returned from Iraq (the\ndead) or do they offer a glimpse of how war deadens the living not only because\nof the horrors of war but also because of the estrangement soldiers experience\nupon their return \u2018home\u2019 (remember, these photographs were taken of US soldiers\nreturned from Iraq)? As portraits, these photographs re-present (a part of) the\nbody, but they also very much beg the question, \u2018Where are these soldier\u2019s bodies,\nand what might they be doing?\u2019 For as Opton shoots them, what is unseen in these\nportraits is every bit as interesting as what is seen.\nThis last question is suggested in another chapter in Opton\u2019s Soldier series.1 In\nChapter III, soldiers are not pictured individually. Instead, soldiers\u2019 heads are\n876 Cynthia Weber\ncradled and supported by someone else\u2019s hands, those of loved ones or other\nsoldiers. The effect of the work in this chapter is to suggest another pairing of\nterms \u2013 individual\/collective \u2013 that are again conflated. For each individual\nreturned soldier seems to require either propping up or soothing by a collective\nbody, presumably the family or the corps. What remains unrepresented here,\nthough, is any wider collective beyond these now intimate, private spheres. What\nis missing, in other words, is some US public sphere.\nThis private\/public divide is again echoed by how the photographs are lit, with\none side of the soldier\u2019s face their private face and the other their public face.\nWhile what is private is usually what is in shadow and more difficult to access,\nOpton\u2019s photographs seem to reverse this. For what they illuminate is the private\npain of individual soldiers. As Opton puts it, \u2018I wanted to see beyond the uniform\nand make vulnerable portraits of individual soldiers\u2019.2 What is less illuminated,\nthen, is the public face of these soldiers and what these soldiers officially represent\n\u2013 some collective US body politic. This is what these symbolically \u2018cut off\u2019 soldiers\u2019\nheads seem to be violently cut off from.\nPlaying with these ideas of the public\/private and the connected\/disconnected,\nthe Light Work gallery in Syracuse, New York, which first exhibited Opton\u2019s\nSoldier series placed these images not just in their gallery but in the wider\ncommunity. Billboards and banners of Opton\u2019s soldiers could be found in car\nparks, on street corners, etc. The effect of placing these images in public spaces was\nnot just to connect the pain and suffering of the disconnected soldierly body back\nto a wider (albeit local) US body politic. The effect was also to provoke a wider\nmeditation on how some US body politic engages (and disengages) with the war\non terror, specifically through its engagement (or lack of engagement) with\ncorporality, the corps, military men and women. The overall effect for this viewer\nat least is to transform Opton\u2019s individual portraits of individual US soldiers into\na commentary on the warring US state, specifically about how the realities of war\ncome \u2018home\u2019 to \u2018rest\u2019. This is a very powerful \u2018portrait\u2019 to draw of the US at this\nparticularly moment in history.\nIf I have one criticism of Opton\u2019s series it is how she has either directed or at\nleast selected some images in which the gazes of her subjects conjure up well-worn\nstereotypes of race and gender. Jefferson, the black male soldier ever so slightly\naggressively looks directly into the camera in line with racial stereotypes. Morris,\nthe white female soldier, averts her eyes downward in line with feminine\nstereotypes. And Pry, the white male soldier shown in this special issue, closes his\neyes which may allow him to serve as the white universal icon of the returned\nsoldier peacefully at rest (one way or another, despite some viewer\u2019s concerns\nabout his continued vulnerability). Whether Opton chose these particularly images\nto reproduce or to question these stereotypes, I do not know. Maybe it was just\nto make the images that much more accessible to a general US public.\nThis criticism notwithstanding, I commend Opton for what is by far one of the\nmost powerful reinventions of the war photography genre at a time when war itself\nis again so brutally being reinvented. Her work is a testimony to the political\npower of aesthetics to make us take notice of what can be so very difficult to look\n1 See www.suzanneopton.com, accessed on 20 February 2008.\n2 {http:\/\/www.lightwork.org\/news\/pr\/opton2006.html} accessed on 20 February 2008.\nResponses to images by Suzanne Opton 877\nat \u2013 the pain and suffering we inflict on both ourselves (a general US public at\nhome) and on others (US soldiers sent abroad to fight for us but also Iraqi citizens\ncaught up in this fighting; see Opton\u2019s photographic series \u2018Citizen\u2019 about displaced\nIraqi citizens).3\ndoi:10.1017\/S0260210509990295\nOn \u2018Soldier\u2019 by Suzanne Opton\nANGUS BOULTON\nThe three series of portrait photographs by Suzanne Opton, economically entitled\n\u2018Soldier\u2019, are presented in chapters, each distinct from the others, though linked by\na common thread. These are quiet studio images by a portrait photographer who,\nreading reports of reintegration problems encountered amongst some of the troops\nreturning from Iraq and Afghanistan, responded by making a project well away\nfrom the battlefield. Opton realised she knew no one directly involved in the\nongoing campaign in the Gulf, and has stated in interviews that she simply wanted\nto \u2018look into the face of someone who\u2019d seen something unforgettable\u2019. The\nrealisation of this body of work followed a prolonged period of research, one in\nwhich Opton encountered continual unwillingness by the military to give access to\ntheir personnel. Following a fortuitous phone call to her local base at Fort Drum,\npermission was eventually granted. Perhaps understandably, these images were\nmade at the beginning of the war, under the guise of an art project, before the\nongoing campaign began to evidently deteriorate.\nI am interested in these images because they are so unlike my own, focusing on\nthe human form rather than the landscape to illuminate the relationship between\nwar and damage. What, then, is the connection between the way portraits and\nlandscapes convey damage, trauma, ruin and decay? While damage to the\nlandscape is recognisable \u2013 be it shattered trees, a bomb crater, a bullet ridden\nbuilding \u2013 damage to individuals is harder to detect. What makes Opton\u2019s portraits\ncompelling is their ambiguity: is she suggesting that these soldiers are merely\nresting? Or inferring that they are actually damaged \u2013 mentally, emotionally and\nphysically?\nIn these images, soldiers Jefferson, Morris and Pry all appear bathed in soft\nlight, clearly defined in colour by a large format camera, their heads resting on a\ntable; simple almost subtle images. An initial impression of their head position,\nunusual within portraiture, suggests these images might have been taken prior to\nsleep. It is the disarming nature of the faces in Chapter I that sets them apart\nwithin a series that also documents soldiers in uniform and soldiers embraced by\nloved ones. Jefferson looks peacefully at the lens, apparently at ease with his\nsurroundings, Morris\u2019s eyelids droop, her gaze down at the table, while Pry has his\neyes closed, lying at peace. Little evidence of their profession is betrayed within\neach photo, the occasional hint of a khaki t-shirt perhaps, the close-cropped\nhaircut, and then one reads the title and caption associated with each image, which\n3 See {www.suzanneopton.com} accessed on 20 February 2008.\n878 Angus Boulton\nsimply states their name and length of time served in Iraq or Afghanistan. With\nthis textual information, a secondary reading of the different facial expressions\nimplies another perspective, a reassessment of their thoughts. Finding that they\nhave been asked to adopt such an unnatural pose for a portrait, having submitted\nto a slow picture making process made with cumbersome apparatus, might give the\nindividuals pause for reflection. Such reflection also extends to the viewer: we are\nencouraged to ask ourselves, \u2018what could they be thinking?\u2019 Are they recalling the\nrecent past, perhaps lying in a similar position under fire? Having been asked to\nadopt this pose in more peaceful surroundings, did it remind them of the recent\npast? Did it reaffirm their survival? These images and their context inevitably ask\nthe viewer a larger question as well: \u2018is it possible to read past experiences \u2013\nespecially difficult, traumatic or uncomfortable experiences \u2013 from a portrait?\u2019.\nOpton wisely chooses not to offer a direct answer to this question. Instead, she\nmerely presents us with images of fresh-faced young recruits, recently returned\nfrom a dangerous war zone and, through inference, asks us simply to look and\ndecide for ourselves. The problem, of course, is that while capturing a face does tell\nus a story, it is never the whole narrative, nor is it necessarily a coherent narrative.\nWhat, then, are we to make of the title captions? To what extent are they meant\nto shape and direct our interpretations?\nWhether we know it or not, our interpretations are not just guided by title\ncaptions \u2013 they are also guided by the tradition of portraiture itself. Portraits play\na part in our lives from an early age, from the school photo right through to\nweddings, holidays and family reunions. However, frequently they are made in\nhappier times. Opton explains that one mother asked for a copy of her son\u2019s\nportrait, specifically because all she possessed were photos from high points in her\nson\u2019s life. She knew he had suffered a great deal in Iraq, and she wanted a record\nof that time to make her family archive somehow complete.1 Yet again we confront\nthe desire for pictures telling us the whole story.\nWhile a mother\u2019s feelings about a portrait of her son are one thing, Opton\u2019s\nimages also raise the question of how we view portraits of unfamiliar subjects: do\nwe really look as closely or as patiently at a subject we do not immediately\nrecognise? As artist and writer Jermy Millar has written, \u2018cynically, we might say\nthat \u201cidentity\u201d is to portraiture as \u201cplace\u201d is to landscape\u2019.2 With this in mind,\nwould the portraits of crying men, made by artist Sam Taylor-Wood, have received\nthe same reception were the subjects not well known actors or celebrities.3 For me,\nTaylor-Wood\u2019s project commented more on the pervasive nature of celebrity\nculture rather than notions of masculinity or the tradition of portraiture. Here,\nOpton has attempted to do the opposite of Taylor-Wood: she has chosen to raise\nthe profile of the unknown soldier. She has taken a representative selection of the\noverlooked younger generation, sent to fight a war that is becoming less popular\nthe longer it continues, and imbued them with a presence, even a degree of dignity.\nThinking about the figure of the unknown soldier, these images put one in mind\nof previous soldier portraits made during an earlier period when photographers\nwere permitted greater access to the battlefield. A notable example would be the\n1 Suzanne Opton, \u2018Soldier\u2019 (Studio 360 Radio Interview, New York, 23 February 2007).\n2 Jeremy Millar, \u2018The First of all Things \u2013 A Very Short Introduction to the History of Place\u2019, in Tacita\nDean and Jeremy Millar (eds), Place (Artworks) (London: Thames and Hudson, 2005), pp. 11\u201326.\n3 Sam Taylor-Wood, \u2018Crying Men\u2019 (Matthew Marks Gallery\/ White Cube\/ Steidel: 2004).\nResponses to images by Suzanne Opton 879\nportrait \u2018Shell shocked soldier, Hue, 1968\u2019 taken by Don McCullin during the\nVietnam War.4 Occasionally the extended caption appears, which informs us that\nthe subject sits awaiting withdrawal from the frontline following the assault on\nHue. Without this anchor, it is possible to read the slightly upward looking gaze\nof McCullin\u2019s soldier differently: is he attending a religious service, looking on as\nthe company Chaplain blesses troops before an impending assault? With the\ncaption in place, the soldier is immediately identified as a casualty of war: we are\ndrawn to questions of post traumatic stress disorder and the lamentable \u2018thousand\nyard stare\u2019 \u2013 empty eyes focussed nowhere in particular, always in the middle\ndistance, possibly raking over vivid nightmares from the recent past. What makes\nMcCullin\u2019s portrait so compelling is that it forces the viewer to confront not only\nthe consequences of war, but the possibility that war has no redemption.\nThose kind of soldier portraits were easier to capture, of course, before\nphotographers were corralled into pools or \u2018embedded\u2019 alongside military minders.\nOpton\u2019s \u2018Soldier\u2019 is one inventive example of how an artist has responded to\nmilitary censorship by producing a challenging group of images that exist in\nconversation with an earlier less-censored tradition of soldier photography. Created\nat a time when imagery from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan are frequently\nnegative or portray an absence of humanity (for example, the Abu Graib images),\nthis intriguing series perhaps offers us an insight into how soldiers live with their\nwar experiences once they return home.\ndoi:10.1017\/S0260210509990301\nSoldier, I wish you well\nCHRIS BROWN\n\u2018Soldier, I wish you well\u2019\nThe street sounds to the soldiers\u2019 tread,\nAnd out we troop to see:\nA single redcoat turns his head,\nHe turns and looks at me.\nMy man, from sky to sky\u2019s so far,\nWe never crossed before;\nSuch leagues apart the world\u2019s ends are,\nWe\u2019re like to meet no more;\nWhat thoughts at heart have you and I\nWe cannot stop to tell;\nBut dead or living, drunk or dry,\nSoldier, I wish you well.\nA.E.

My inability to articulate a response may\nbe partly because, in so far as I have a strong aesthetic sense, it is focused on\nliterature and music rather than the visual arts, and so it is fortunate for me that\nthese remarkable photographs immediately brought to mind the poem quoted\nabove \u2013 and this alternative reference point is not simply literary but also musical;\nHousman\u2019s cycle, once amongst the most popular of poems, is now best known\nthrough settings by early 20th century English composers, most particularly the\ndoomed George Butterworth, killed by a sniper on the Somme in August 1916.1\nThe contrast between the way Housman and Opton express what are, on the face\nof it, similar thoughts is, to my mind, fascinating.\nHousman provides some, but by no means all, of the context necessary to read\nthe poem. It is clear that the person who makes fleeting contact with the narrator\nis a soldier, a redcoat, indeed the observer is drawn to the scene in the first place\nby the soldiers\u2019 tread \u2013 but what may not be clear to a twenty-first century reader\nis that there is something slightly threatening about the scene Housman is\ndescribing. Britain\u2019s army in the 19th century was small and professional, with the\nordinary soldiery drawn from the ill-educated, not to say brutish, rural poor. It\nwas mostly based abroad in the Empire, and the relatively small numbers of\nsoldiers based at home were largely on ceremonial duties or used for riot-control.\nSoldiers marching through the streets of industrial or mining towns were not\ninfrequently stoned by the crowd; in Housman\u2019s small market towns the situation\nwould have been somewhat less fraught, but soldiers in the street were rarely\nwelcome. The Shropshire lad who is both the object and subject of these poems has\na fascination with premature death, his own and that of his friends and lovers.\nPossibly, as a result, the military feature far more prominently in the cycle than\nmight have been expected in what was still an overwhelmingly civilian society \u2013 still\nthere is no natural affinity to be expected between the narrator (much less his\nclassicist creator) and the redcoat who happens to turn his head at the right\nmoment. This is a fleeting encounter with no chance of any meeting of minds,\nwhich gives a particular purity to the benevolence expressed in the final line of the\npoem. Eye contact alone produces this sentiment, but a simple expression of\nwell-wishing without this very brief encounter would have a different, and lesser\nforce. I can imagine the local squire or magnate toasting the troops as the\nupholders of the natural order of things, and although the sentiment would be\nquite genuine, it would have none of the emotional force of the simple statement,\n\u2018Soldier [not soldiers, for this is an individual], I wish you well\u2019.\nSuzanne Opton, unlike Housman, interprets her pictures \u2013 but then she has to,\nbecause the pictures on their own defy interpretation. I can see the head of a young\n1 Irritatingly, Butterworth did not actually set \u2018The street sounds to the soldiers tread\u2019, but Arthur\nSommervell did. Although written in a less ironic age, Butterworth\u2019s setting of \u2018The lads in their\nhundreds to Ludlow come in for the fair\u2019, with its final couplet\nThey carry back bright to the coiner the mintage of man,\nThe lads that will die in their glory and never be old.\ncan still be surprisingly evocative when sung with the right emotional force, as Simon Keenlyside\nproved at the Wigmore Hall on 9 January 2008, explicitly referring to our current wars.\nResponses to images by Suzanne Opton 881\nperson resting on a textured surface that might be a carpet, and I am told that this\nis the head of a soldier \u2013 the exhibition is, after all, called \u2018Soldiers\u2019 \u2013 but this is\nsomething I have to take on trust; for all I know they might be models; after all,\na buzz cut does not a soldier make. Their names are provided, it is said that they\nhave recently returned from Iraq or Afghanistan and that their faces \u2018[hint] at the\ntransformative experiences of war\u2019; more, the blogger David Mixner tells us that\n\u2018you can see the war etched into their faces\u2019.2 Interestingly, the National Public\nRadio report on Opton\u2019s exhibition adds that \u2018in some of the portraits, nothing\nwould indicate that they have served in the military, leaving the context to be read\nfrom their faces\u2019.3 This is interesting because it is patently false \u2013 there is no way\nyou could read any kind of context from these faces, any more than you can see\nwar etched on them, whatever that means. Changing the subject for a moment,\nthese photographs pose some of the same problems as \u2018programme\u2019 music, music\nthat is designed to evoke an extra-musical idea. Thus, for example, there is nothing\nin the music of Elgar\u2019s Falstaff (Op. 68) that could not just as easily be a portrait\nof my grandmother or the Director of the LSE, or for that matter not be a portrait\nat all. The point being that if we take seriously the programme suggested by the\ncomposer (and there is no reason why we should) we do so simply because we\nrecognise his authority as auteur, not because of anything in the work of art itself\nthat gives us any kind of context. Being suggestible by nature, we hear music we\nare told is cheerful as cheerful, but if we had been told differently we would hear\nit differently.\nThis is very much to the point when we look at Opton\u2019s photographs. What we\n(or at least I) actually see is a set of human faces. Although I suspect that,\naccording to her aesthetic, I ought not to allow her the privileges of an auteur, I\u2019ll\ntake Opton\u2019s word for it that they are soldiers who have returned from Iraq and\nAfghanistan, and not artists\u2019 models whose expressions convey the boredom\nassociated with their trade rather than the thousand-yard stare of the combat\nveteran. It really does not matter. These are people we have not met before and\n\u2018we are like to meet no more\u2019; we do not know what is in their hearts and they\ndo not know what is in ours \u2013 but, for some reason that it is still difficult to put\ninto words, we can, and I do, wish them well.\n2 Light Work Press Release {http:\/\/www.lightwork.org\/exhibitions\/past\/opton.html} DavidMixner.com\n{http:\/\/www.lightwork.org\/exhibitions\/past\/opton.html}.\n3 {http:\/\/www.npr.org\/templates\/story\/story.php?storyId=7403169}.\n882 Chris Brown\n"}
