This gives rise to a reactive carbon-centred \nradical and a much less reactive, or dormant, dithiocarbamate radical, in which the unpaired electron is delocalized over the DTC \nstructure. The chemistry of the latter is dominated by recombination to reform covalent bonds. It is the ability of dormant radicals \nto recapture the carbon-centred radical after addition of monomer to form a new DTC ester that imparts living character to DTC \nester-initiated photopolymerization. Compounds of this type have been used in the synthesis of telechelic polymers,[3] block[4,5] \nor graft copolymers[5,6] and hyperbranched polymers.[7] In the latter context, Otsu et al.[8] synthesized the first example of a \nDTC ester of a polymerizable derivative; the 4-vinylbenzyl ester of N,N-diethyldithiocarbamic acid, creating \u201cinimer\u201d - a \ncompound that combines iniferter and monomer functionalities. Inimer could be polymerized photochemically to form \nhyperbranched polymers or by conventional thermal initiation to form linear polymers with pendant DTC ester groups. These \npolymers are macro-iniferters, which allow the photochemical grafting of a range of other monomers. As well as the inimer of \nOtsu,[8] similar compounds, based on methacrylates, have been reported.[9] \nIn polymers of these compounds, irradiation will generate active macroradicals and dormant dithiocarbamyl radicals as low \nmolar mass fragments. The macroradicals will react rapidly with monomer, oxygen or with dithiocarbamyl radical to reform \nDTC esters. The situation will be different however if the dithiocarbamyl radical is part of the polymeric system and the active \nradical is the low molar mass fragment. A likely scenario under these circumstances is that during prolonged irradiation, the more \nreadily diffusible carbon-centred radicals will dimerise, forming stable low-molar mass by-products, leading to an excess of \ndithiocarbamyl radicals attached to the polymer. This will result in the creation of a relatively stable population of polymeric \ndormant radicals. The physics and chemistry of immobilized dithiocarbamyl dormant radicals is expected to be an exciting field \nof investigation, since materials containing stable radicals may possess useful photo-responsive magnetic, mechanical and \nelectrical properties. Polymers with other stable radical functionalities, such as nitroxy radicals, have been reported as novel \nbattery materials[10] and alkoxamines in the side chain[11] or main chain[12] and have been used as thermally-activated systems \nfor the reorganization of polymeric materials, via radical crossover reactions. Similarly, reversible decross-linking to radical \nfragments has been shown to occur in response to light or pressure, in the case of triphenylimidazole dimers, present as cross-\nlinks on a methacrylate backbone.[13]  \nIn order to develop new materials to explore the properties of polymeric dithiocarbamyl radicals, we designed a monomer, \nsuperficially similar to inimer, [8] but reversing the orientation of the molecule, as shown in Scheme 1, such that the \ndithiocarbamyl residue is the polymerizable part of the molecule.  \n \nThe monomer, 1 (Scheme 1) was prepared by reaction of CS2 with amine in the presence of base,[14] following the \u201cone-\npot\u201d method proposed by Azizi et al.[15] A nominally linear polymer, (2) was prepared in toluene by AIBN-initiated thermal \npolymerization in the dark. \nUV irradiation of solutions of 2 is expected to result in cleavage of the C-S bond, creating benzyl radicals and polymeric \nsulfur radicals. While recombination of the radical pair will reform the initial DTC ester groups, recombination of \u201clike\u201d radicals \nwill result in cross-linking due to the formation of S-S bonds and, as frustrations due to cross-linking increase, isolated sulfur \nradicals, which are expected to be relatively long-lived. This process will be aided by benzyl radical recombination to form 1,2-\ndiphenylethane (4) as by-product, (Scheme 2). Irradiation of 2 was performed in chloroform solution. While this solvent is not \nideal for performing photochemical studies, due to the possibility of side-reactions from photolysis of the solvent, nevertheless it \nwas used on account of the greater solubility of the polymer in CHCl3 than in other solvents (such as acetonitrile) which do not \nsuffer from these problems. \n \n \nThe kinetics of radical formation during irradiation of 1 and 2 was investigated by EPR (Figure 1a). In these two cases the \nDTC ester group is intact at the start of the experiment. The intensity of the EPR signal was seen to increase linearly as a function \nof irradiation time over the first 2000s, starting from zero intensity at time t = 0s. This is a characteristic of a system in which the \nformation of active species is fast compared to other processes (such as polymer propagation) and where the rate of termination \n 2 \ncan be considered to be negligible until relatively high conversions.[16] The auto cross-linked polymer, 3, showed different \nbehaviour, possessing a significant EPR signal before irradiation due to the presence of isolated dormant radical species (Figure \n1b). Since this sample had been prepared more than 2 weeks previously, it shows the remarkable longevity of dormant radicals in \nthis system. The generation of additional radical species is expected to occur as a result of dissociation of thiuram groups, present \nas cross-links between polymer chains. The rate of development of the EPR signal in the case of 3 was not linear with time. The \nsignal did not increase after ~1500s, suggesting that the rates of radical formation and loss were approximately equal. \n \nIn order to investigate the early stages of photochemical cross-linking, samples of 2 were irradiated for 1, 3 or 5 min only and \nthe solutions examined by GPC. The non-irradiated 2 (Figure 2a, (i)) showed a monomodal peak centred at 18k. During \nirradiation, the solution viscosity increased rapidly due to increases in molar mass. The average MW of the polymeric fraction \nproduced after 5 min irradiation was 20k (Figure 2b, upper line). The solution also contained a growing fraction with a much \nhigher MW, estimated to be >150k, which is most likely formed during the initial stages of gel formation.  \nUV irradiation for around 4 h was required to create 3 which was no longer soluble in either CHCl3 or THF and appeared as a \nswollen gel. Precipitation into methanol was performed to separate the gel fraction from soluble material and the supernatant \nanalysed by GPC. The result, (Figure 2a, curve ii) showed complete disappearance of 2 (MW = 18k) and formation of both high \nand low molecular weight products, proving that cross-linking had occurred between polymer chains. The by-product of active \nradical recombination, 1,2-diphenylethane (4) was also detected, the peak in the GPC having the same retention time as an \nauthentic sample. Identification of the by-product was confirmed by HPLC-MS and NMR. Evidence for the proposed mechanism \nof cross-linking can also be seen in the FT-IR. The spectrum of 3 (Figure 3, upper curve) showed a strong peak due to S-S \nstretching at 750 cm\u22121, [17] which was absent from the spectra of 1 and 2 (Figure 3, lower curve). Signals due to C=S and C-N \nstretching vibrations, at 1174 and 1477 cm\u22121 respectively, were found in the spectra of all three compounds. \n \nAs a final demonstration that the cross-links in 3 were due to reversible formation of S-S bonds, 3 was irradiated with an \nexcess of tetraethyl dithiuram disulfide (6), (Scheme 3). Under these conditions the polymer was rendered completely soluble \nafter 6 h irradiation, followed by 42 h in the dark, the GPC (Figure 4) and NMR (Supporting Information, Figure S2) being \nconsistent with the change. \nWe have presented an efficient approach to the synthesis of a new range of photoresponsive DTC-containing polymeric \nmaterials. We believe that the ability to generate a high concentration of stable radicals under controlled conditions has the \npotential to be used in many application areas. These may include engineering adhesives, UV filters, separation materials, sensors \nfor radicals, trapping of reactive oxygen species and as antioxidants, thermoplastic vulcanizates, and as new materials for \nmicroelectronics. \nExperimental Section \nDetails of the synthesis of all compounds and polymers and of the irradiation experiments are given in the supporting information. \nReceived: ((will be filled in by the editorial staff)) \nPublished online on ((will be filled in by the editorial staff)) \nAcknowledgements \nWe acknowledge Cranfield Health for funding and thank Bruker Biospin, Germany for providing the EPR data. \nSupporting information for this article is available on the WWW under http:\/\/www.angewandte.org or from the author. \n \n[1] a) R.
