We observe the effect of a\ngeneralised mutation M of a link on the Jones polynomial. Using this, we describe a method for\nobtaining invariants of links which are also invariant under M .\nThe Jones polynomial of welded links is not well-de\u0002ned in Z[q1\/4, q\u22121\/4]. Taking M = Fo\nallows us to pass to a quotient of Z[q1\/4, q\u22121\/4] in which the Jones polynomial is well-de\u0002ned. We\nget the same result for M = Fu, so in fact, the Jones polynomial in this ring de\u0002nes a fused isotopy\ninvariant. We show it is non-trivial and compute it for links with one or two components.\n1. Introduction\nVirtual links were defined by Kauffman in [5]. There, and independently in [2], it was\nproved that classical knots embed in virtual knots, so all invariants of virtual knots restrict\nto classical knots. Kauffman described how to extend the bracket and Jones polynomials\nto virtual knots in [5].\nLet D be a virtual link diagram in R2, that is a link diagram with an extra type of\ncrossing called virtual crossing. Virtual isotopy is equivalence of diagrams under the clas-\nsical Reidemeister moves R1, R2, R3 and virtual moves V1, V2, V3, V4 shown in figure 1.\nHowever the forbidden moves Fo and Fu which are shown in figure 2 are not allowed.\nWelded isotopy is the extension of virtual isotopy which also allows the Fo move. A\nwelded link is the equivalence class of a virtual link diagram under welded isotopy. Welded\nlinks can be obtained as the closure of welded braids [1], [3].\nIt is worth noting that the knot group is a welded isotopy invariant and so any knot\nwith non-trivial knot group is not welded isotopic to the unknot. Hence the class of welded\nknots is not trivial.\nAllowing both of the forbidden moves Fo and Fu gives rise to fused isotopy, also in-\ntroduced by Kauffman in [5]. It was shown in [2] and [4] that any virtual knot is fused\n1\n2 Jones Polynomial Invariants\nisotopic to the unknot.\nThe virtual knot in figure 3 has non-trivial Jones polynomial, therefore it is not virtually\nthe unknot. On the other hand, it is the unknot under welded isotopy. This shows that the\nJones polynomial, defined in the ring Z[q1\/4, q\u22121\/4] is not an invariant of welded links.\nWe will find a quotient of this ring where Kauffman\u2019s bracket polynomial is a non-\ntrivial regular isotopy invariant and the Jones polynomial is a non-trivial isotopy invariant\nof welded links. Furthermore we show that this is also invariant under the other forbidden\nmove, Fu, and so it is a fused isotopy invariant.\nV 1 V 2\nV 3 V 4\nFigure 1: Virtual moves\nF uF o\nFigure 2: Forbidden moves Fo and Fu\nFigure 3: A non-trivial virtual knot which is welded isotopic to the unknot\nFrom now on, a link diagram will mean an unoriented virtual link diagram in R2 unless\nstated otherwise. Positive and negative smoothings of a real crossing of a link diagram D\nare shown in figure 4. Smoothing all of the real crossings of D leaves a virtual link diagram\nJones Polynomial Invariants 3\nwith no real crossings (which may have virtual crossings). Such a diagram is equivalent\nto the unlink (possibly via some V1, V2, V3 moves). A choice of smoothing of all of the\nclassical crossings is called a state of D. Denote the set of all states of D by S(D). Let\nd = \u2212A2 \u2212 A\u22122, \u03b1(S) = number of positive smoothings, \u03b2(S) = number of negative\nsmoothings and t(S) = number of circles for each S \u2208 S(D). Then Kauffman\u2019s bracket\npolynomial is defined to be:\n\u3008S\u3009 := dt(S)\u22121 and\n\u3008D\u3009 :=\n\u2211\nS\u2208S(D)\nA\u03b1(S)\u2212\u03b2(S)\u3008S\u3009.\nThis is a regular isotopy invariant of virtual links. Orient D and let w(D) be the writhe\nof the diagram. If L is the link represented by this oriented diagram, then the Kauffman\npolynomial pL(A) := (\u2212A)\u22123w(D)\u3008D\u3009 is an isotopy invariant. Kauffman showed that this\npolynomial evaluated at A = q\u22121\/4 is the Jones polynomial VL(q) \u2208 Z[q1\/4, q\u22121\/4].\nFigure 4: Positive and negative smoothings\n2. General Method\nDe\u0002nition 1. Let D be a link diagram and let B be a disc. Call T = D\u2229B a (generalised)\ntangle if D intersects \u2202B transversally and D \u2229 \u2202B does not contain any crossing points.\nNote that, D \u2229 \u2202B consists of an even number of points which we will call the end\npoints. This differs from the usual notion of a tangle since extra circles are allowed, but we\nwill refer to these generalised tangles as tangles throughout.\nDe\u0002nition 2. Let T be a tangle in a diagram D with 2k end points on D \u2229 \u2202B. Label an\narbitrary end point by 1 and label the others 2, 3, . . . , 2k in a clockwise direction. Fix this\nlabelling. Then the inside permutation of the end points of the arcs of T can be expressed\nin a unique way, by pi = [1x2][x3x4] . . . [x2k\u22121x2k], where\n1. xi \u2208 {2, . . . , 2k} for all i = 2, . . . , 2k.\n2. x2i\u22121 < x2i+1 for i = 2, . . . , k \u2212 1.\n3. x2i\u22121 < x2i for i = 2, . . . , k.\n4. Each [x2i\u22121x2i] means that the end points enumerated as x2i\u22121, x2i are joined by an\narc of T .\nDe\u0002nition 3. Let D be a link diagram and let T denote a tangle in D. Write D = T \u222a\n(D \u2212 T ). Then a state of T is a choice of smoothing of all of the classical crossings in T ,\nand a state of D \u2212 T is a choice of smoothing of all of the classical crossings in D \u2212 T .\n4 Jones Polynomial Invariants\n1 2 3\n4 5 6\n[ 1 4 ] [ 2 5 ] [ 5 6 ]\nFigure 5: The inside permutation of a tangle\nSince T may contain real crossings, a state S \u2208 S(D \u2212 T ) is a possibly non-trivial link\nwhich we denote by T (S). T (S) contains T as a tangle and has no real crossings in the\ncomplement of T .\nDe\u0002nition 4. Let T be a tangle in a diagram D. The outside permutation of T is the\npermutation of the endpoints of T induced be the arcs outside B.\nDe\u0002nition 5. Let D be a link diagram which contains a tangle T in a disc B. Remove T\nand replace it with another tangle T \u2032 where T \u2229 \u2202B = T \u2032 \u2229 \u2202B. This operation is called\na generalised mutation and we will denote this move in a diagram by M . Note that the\nreplacement of T \u2032 by T is also considered an M move, as usual.\nTheorem 1. Suppose D\u2032 is obtained from D by an M move which replaces the tangle T\nby T \u2032. Then\n\u3008D\u3009 \u2212 \u3008D\u2032\u3009 =\n\u2211\nS\u2208S(D\u2212T )\n(\u3008T (S)\u3009 \u2212 \u3008T \u2032(S)\u3009) hS(A) where hS(A) \u2208 Z[A,A\n\u22121].\nProof. \u3008D\u3009 =\n\u2211\nS\u2208S(D) A\n\u03b1(S)\u2212\u03b2(S)\u3008S\u3009 =\n\u2211\nS\u2208S(D\u2212T ) A\n\u03b1(S)\u2212\u03b2(S)\u3008T (S)\u3009.\nSimilarly \u3008D\u2032\u3009 =\n\u2211\nS\u2208S(D\u2032\u2212T \u2032) A\n\u03b1(S)\u2212\u03b2(S)\u3008T \u2032(S)\u3009. Since D \u2212 T = D\u2032 \u2212 T \u2032, they have\nthe same states and the result follows. \u0003\nLet T and T \u2032 be two tangles which agree on the boundary of the disc B. Consider all\nof the possible ways of joining the end points of \u2202B outside B without introducing any\nclassical crossings. Each of these joinings give link diagrams DT , DT \u2032 which are identical\noutside B. In other words, DT \u2032 is obtained by a mutation M from the diagram DT where\nDT is a link diagram obtained by joining the end points of T . Compute \u3008DT \u3009 \u2212 \u3008DT \u2032\u3009 for\neach possibility. Let IM be the ideal of Z[A,A\u22121] generated by these polynomials.\nTheorem 2. Let D and D\u02c6 be diagrams which are equivalent under regular isotopy ex-\ntended by the M move which replaces tangle T by T \u2032. Then \u3008D\u3009 \u2212 \u3008D\u02c6\u3009 \u2208 IM .\nProof. Suppose D\u02c6 is obtained from D by a finite sequence, D = D0 \u2192 D1 \u2192 . . . \u2192\nDN = D\u02c6, of R1, R2, V1, V2, V3, V4 and M moves. Suppose also that Dk\u22121\nf\n\u2192 Dk. If\n1. f \u2208 {R2, R3, V1, V2, V3, V4}, then the two diagrams are regular isotopic and we have\n\u3008Dk\u3009 = \u3008Dk\u22121\u3009.\n2. f = M then, by theorem 1, \u3008Dk\u3009 \u2212 \u3008Dk\u22121\u3009 \u2208 IM .\nJones Polynomial Invariants 5\nCorollary 1. The bracket polynomial is a regular isotopy invariant, which is also invariant\nunder the M move in the ring Z[A,A\u22121]\/IM .\nDefine IM (q\u22121\/4) := {p(q\u22121\/4) \u2208 Z[q1\/4, q\u22121\/4] | p(A) \u2208 IM}.\nCorollary 2. Suppose M is a generalised mutation which leaves the writhe of the diagram\ninvariant. Then the Jones polynomial of an oriented link in the quotient ring\nZ[q1\/4, q\u22121\/4]\/IM (q\n\u22121\/4) is an isotopy invariant which is also invariant under the M\nmove.\n3. Application to welded and fused links\nWe apply the theory, using the forbidden move Fo as the M move. An Fo move replaces\nthe tangle T with P , which are shown in figure 6. We will find the ideal Io generated by\n\u3008DT \u3009 \u2212 \u3008DP \u3009.\n1 2 3 1 2 3\n4 5 6 4 5 6\nT P\nFigure 6: Tangles T and P\nFrom now on T and P will denote these specific tangles, lying in the disc B and whose\nend points are labelled as in the figure. Let us compute \u3008DT \u3009 \u2212 \u3008DP \u3009 for all possibilities.\nThe states of T and P (within B) are shown in figures 7 and 8 respectively.\nTo compute \u3008DT \u3009 \u2212 \u3008DP \u3009 the other information required is the number of circles in\neach state. Let us denote the four possible states of T and P by Ti and Pi, for i = 1, 2, 3, 4,\nrespectively. Outside B the end points of any Ti or Pi are joined by arcs which may contain\nvirtual crossings.\nSince the tangles T and P have 3 arcs each, then any Ti or Pi can have either 1,2 or\n3 components. We can work out exactly how many by looking at the information about\nthe joining of end points as follows. Suppose that inside B we have the permutation\n[1a][bc][de]. Then in order to obtain 3 components we must have exactly the same out-\nside permutation. To obtain 2 components, we must have exactly one of the transpositions\n[1a], [bc] or [de] in the outside permutation. Otherwise we have only 1 component.\nOutside B, there are 15 ways of joining the ends of the 3 arcs of any Ti or Pi. We need\nto find the number of circles ti, pi in Ti, Pi in each case. Looking at figure 7, we see that\ninside B\nT1 \u2194 [15][26][34], T2 \u2194 [13][26][45], T3 \u2194 [12][34][56], T4 \u2194 [13][24][56].\n6 Jones Polynomial Invariants\nT\n1\nT\n2 T 3 T 4\nFigure 7: States of T\nP\n1\nP\n2 P 3 P 4\nFigure 8: States of P\nLooking at figure 8, we see that inside B\nP1 \u2194 [16][24][35], P2 \u2194 [16][23][45], P3 \u2194 [12][35][46], P4 \u2194 [15][23][46].\nWe also have the formula \u3008DT \u3009\u2212\u3008DP \u3009 = A2(dt1\u22121\u2212dp1\u22121)+(dt2\u22121\u2212dp2\u22121)+(dt3\u22121\u2212\ndp3\u22121)+A\u22122(dt4\u22121\u2212 dp4\u22121). In the table below, we find the number of circles outside B\nfor each case and compute \u3008DT \u3009 \u2212 \u3008DP \u3009.\nt1, p1 t2, p2 t3, p3 t4, p4 \u3008DT \u3009 \u2212 \u3008DP \u3009\n[12][34][56] 2,1 1,1 3,2 2,1 g1(A)\n[12][35][46] 1,2 1,1 2,3 1,2 \u2212g1(A)\n[12][36][45] 1,1 2,2 2,2 1,1 0\n[13][24][56] 1,2 2,1 2,1 3,1 g2(A)\n[13][25][46] 1,1 2,1 1,2 2,2 0\n[13][26][45] 2,1 3,2 1,1 2,1 g1(A)\n[14][23][56] 1,1 1,2 2,1 2,2 0\n[14][25][36] 1,1 1,1 1,1 1,1 0\n[14][26][35] 2,2 2,1 1,2 1,1 0\n[15][23][46] 2,1 1,2 1,2 1,3 \u2212g2(A)\n[15][24][36] 2,2 1,1 1,1 2,2 0\n[15][26][34] 3,1 2,1 2,1 1,2 g2(A\u22121)\n[16][23][45] 1,2 2,3 1,1 1,2 \u2212g1(A)\n[16][24][35] 1,3 1,2 1,2 2,1 \u2212g2(A\u22121)\n[16][25][34] 2,2 1,2 2,1 1,1 0\nA simple calculation shows that g1(A) = 0 and g2(A) = A\u22126 \u2212 A\u22122 \u2212 1 + A4. Also\nJones Polynomial Invariants 7\nnotice that g2(A\u22121) = A6 \u2212A2 \u2212 1 + A\u22124 = A2g2(A).\nCorollary 3. If D and D\u2032 are regular isotopic welded diagrams, then\n\u3008D\u3009 \u2261 \u3008D\u2032\u3009 in the quotient ring R := Z[A,A\u22121]\/Io where Io is the ideal generated by\ng(A) := A\u22124 \u2212 1 \u2212 A2 + A6. Hence the bracket polynomial is a regular welded isotopy\ninvariant in the ring R.\nProof. Put M = Fo. Then \u3008DT \u3009 \u2212 \u3008DP \u3009 \u2208 {0,\u00b1g(A),\u00b1A\u22122g(A)} follows from the\nabove calculations. Now apply theorem 2. \u0003\nCorollary 4. The Jones polynomial of an oriented welded link in the quotient ring\nZ[q1\/4, q\u22121\/4]\/Io(q\n\u22121\/4) is a welded isotopy invariant (we also denote this ring by R).\nProof. An Fo move does not change the writhe of the diagram. \u0003\nWelded isotopy allows the Fo move, but not the Fu move. Suppose we define an equiv-\nalence of diagrams allowing the Fu move instead of the Fo move. Consider the tangles T\nand P in figure 6. By changing all the over crossings to undercrossings in both tangles we\nget two new tangles T \u2032 and P \u2032. Notice that the states of T \u2032 are the same as states of T\nwith coefficient A replaced by A\u22121. This gives us \u3008DT \u2032\u3009 = A2dt4 + dt3 + dt2 + A\u22122dt1 .\nSimilarly for P \u2032. So to compute \u3008DT \u2032\u3009 \u2212 \u3008DP \u2032\u3009, we replace A by A\u22121 in \u3008DT \u3009 \u2212 \u3008DP \u3009.\nTherefore we obtain:\nCorollary 5. The Jones polynomial of an oriented link is invariant under isotopy extended\nby the Fu move in the ring R.\nProof. By the above observations \u3008DT \u2032\u3009\u2212\u3008DP \u2032\u3009 \u2208 {0,\u00b1g(A\u00b11)}. But g(A\u22121) = A2g(A)\nso \u3008DT \u2032\u3009 \u2212 \u3008DP \u2032\u3009 generates the same ideal as \u3008DT \u3009 \u2212 \u3008DP \u3009. \u0003\nHence if we allow both of the moves Fo and Fu, we get:\nTheorem 3. The Jones polynomial of fused links in R is a fused isotopy invariant.\nProof. Io = Iu where Iu is the ideal from the Fu move. \u0003\nAccording to the result of Kanenobu [4] and Goussarov-Polyak-Viro [2], any virtual\nknot is fused isotopic to the unknot. As a result, we have:\nTheorem 4. The Jones polynomial of any virtual knot in R is 1.\nCorollary 6. Let D be any knot diagram. Then \u3008D\u3009 \u2261 (\u2212A)3w(D) mod Io.\nProof. Since the Kauffman polynomial of any virtual knot is 1 mod Io, we have\n(\u2212A)\u22123w(D)\u3008D\u3009 \u2261 1 mod Io. \u0003\nDe\u0002nition 6. Let D be an oriented virtual link diagram with components li. We define the\nlinking number lk(li, lj) := 12 (algebraic sum of the classical crossings of components li\nand lj). If D has n components, we call the sum of all lk(li, lj), 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n the total\nlinking number.\nThis definition agrees with the linking number of classical links and is invariant under Vk\nfor k = 2, 3, 4, Fo and Fu moves. Therefore the (total) linking number is well defined for\nvirtual links, welded links and fused links. Of course, this number need not be an integer\nanymore. For example the linking number of the components of the virtual right Hopf link\nV RH , shown in figure 9b, is 1\/2.\nTheorem 5. Let L be an oriented virtual link with 2 components l1, l2 such that lk(l1, l2) =\nk \u2208 12Z. Then the Jones polynomial of L is VL(q) \u2261 \u2212q\n1\/2 \u2212 q3k\u22121\/2 mod Io.\n8 Jones Polynomial Invariants\na : R H b : V R H c : U 2\nFigure 9: Three distinct fused links\nProof. Let D be an oriented diagram of L and let Di correspond to the components li of\nL, for i = 1, 2. Then the writhe of D is w(D) = w(D1) + w(D2) + 2k where w(Di)\ndenotes the algebraic sum of the crossings of Di with itself. Consider a real crossing\nbetween D1 and D2 (if there are no real crossings, simply introduce one by an R2 move).\nWithout loss of generality, suppose this crossing is positive. Smoothing D at this crossing,\nwe get \u3008D\u3009 = A\u3008K1\u3009 + A\u22121\u3008K2\u3009. Then the Kauffman polynomial of L is pL(A) =\n(\u2212A)\u22123w(D)(A\u3008K1\u3009 + A\n\u22121\u3008K2\u3009) where K1 and K2 are both knot diagrams. Therefore\nby corollary 6, we obtain pL(A) \u2261 (\u2212A)\u22123w(D)(A(\u2212A)3w(K1) + A\u22121(\u2212A)3w(K2)) mod\nIo. We obtain K1 by positive smoothing, hence it induces the orientation of D and it has\none less positive crossing, so w(K1) = w(D) \u2212 1. K2 does not induce an orientation\nfrom D. Orient K2. Recall that the writhe of a knot is independent of its orientation.\nThe orientation on K2 will agree with the orientation of one of D1 or D2 and disagree\nwith the other one. Therefore the linking number will make a negative contribution to\nw(K2). So we can compute w(K2) = w(D1) + w(D2) \u2212 (2k \u2212 1) = w(D) \u2212 4k + 1.\nSubstituting back, pL(A) \u2261 \u2212A\u22122\u2212A\u221212k+2 mod Io. Then the Jones polynomial of L is\nVL(q) \u2261 \u2212q\n1\/2 \u2212 q3k\u22121\/2 mod Io. \u0003\n4. Computations\nGiven two virtual links L and L\u2032, we develop a method to test if pL \u2261 pL\u2032 mod Io.\nDe\u0002nition 7. Represent a polynomial \u03a3mi=\u2212nciAi \u2208 Z[A,A\u22121] by its coefficient sequence,\nwhich is the bi-infinite sequence with finitely many nonzero terms and whose k-th term\ncorresponds to the coefficient of Ak.\nDe\u0002nition 8. Let rm denote the sequence (. . . , 0, 1, 0, 0, 0,\u22121, 0,\u22121, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, . . .),\nwhere the last nonzero term is the coefficient of Am. In particular, r6 corresponds to g(A).\nLemma 1. For each m, rm = (. . . , 0, 1, 0, 0, 0,\u22121, 0,\u22121, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, . . .) \u2208 Io.\nProof. The ideal Io is generated by g(A) = A\u22124 \u2212 1\u2212A2 + A6. Thus any polynomial of\nthe form Akg(A) = Ak\u22124 \u2212Ak \u2212Ak+2 + Ak+6 \u2208 Io, for any k \u2208 Z. \u0003\nTheorem 6. Let L and L\u2032 be virtual links and let u, v be the coefficient sequences of pL\nand pL\u2032 respectively. Then pL \u2261 pL\u2032 mod Io if and only if u \u2212 v = \u03a3ki=1cirni where\nni \u2208 Z.\nProof. Suppose pL \u2261 pL\u2032 mod Io. Then pL \u2212 pL\u2032 = \u03a3mi=\u2212nciA\nig(A). Therefore u\u2212 v =\n\u03a3mi=\u2212ncir6+i.\nConversely, if u\u2212 v = \u03a3ki=1cirni , then the right hand side of the equation is clearly in\nIo, and so the left hand side must also be in Io. \u0003\nJones Polynomial Invariants 9\nDe\u0002nition 9. Two coefficient sequences u, v are called equivalent in R if they represent\nequivalent polynomials in R.\nLemma 2. Every equivalence class of coefficient sequences has a representative of the\nform (. . . , 0, c\u22124, . . . , c6, 0, . . .).\nProof. Suppose we have a polynomial p in R and a representative of it is given by the\ncoefficient sequence um = (. . . , 0, cn, . . . , cm, 0, . . .). If m > 6, then compute uk =\num\u2212 cmrm. Clearly um and uk are equivalent and k < m. Note that cl for l < m\u221210 are\nunchanged by this operation. In particular, cl for l < \u22124 are not changed. Applying this\noperation finitely many times gives a coefficient sequence which is equivalent to um and\nwhose last nonzero term has index \u2264 6. Similarly, we can eliminate terms cl, for l < \u22124\nwithout effecting terms with index k > 6. This sequence corresponds to a representative\nof p, whose highest degree is at most A6 and lowest degree at least A\u22124. \u0003\nFor example, g(A) is such a representative. But a representative written in this form is\nnot unique.\nLemma 3. Every equivalence class of coefficient sequences has a unique representative of\nthe form (. . . , 0, c\u22124, . . . , c6, 0, . . .), with c0 = 1. That is, every polynomial in R can be\nwritten uniquely in the form c\u22124A\u22124 + . . . + c6A6 with c0 = 1.\nProof. Given a coefficient sequence, lemma 2 shows there is a representative of it in the\nform u = (. . . , 0, c\u22124, . . . , c6, 0, . . .). Then u+(c0\u22121)r6 is a representative in the required\nform.\nTo show uniqueness, we first note that the coefficient sequence \u2212r6 satisfies the condi-\ntions of the lemma and corresponds to the generator g of the ideal Io. Suppose that there\nis another sequence u satisfying these conditions and u + r6 = \u03a3ki=1cirni . If k = 1 then\nsince u satisfies the conditions, n1 \u2264 6 and n1 \u2212 10 \u2265 \u22124 which lead to n1 = 6. So\nu = (c1 \u2212 1)r6. But we must have c1 \u2212 1 = \u22121, hence u = \u2212r6. Now suppose k > 1.\nWithout loss of generality, assume that ci 6= 0 for all i and n1 < . . . < nk. Then we\nhave \u22124 \u2264 n1 \u2212 10 < n1 < nk \u2264 6 leading to a contradiction. Hence \u2212r6 is the unique\nrepresentative of g satisfying the conditions. Therefore each polynomial class in R has a\nunique representative in the desired form. \u0003\nBelow, we compute the Kauffman polynomial of some virtual links, and find their\nunique representatives modulo Io. Let us denote the unique form of a polynomial pL by\npL.\nExample 1. Using theorem 5, we compute the polynomials of the links shown in figure 9.\nThe linking number of the components of the right hopf link RH is 1. Now pRH(A) \u2261\n\u2212A\u221210\u2212A\u22122 mod Io. We find its standard form in R as follows: Ignoring the zeros at the\nbeginning and at the end\nk -10 -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4\nu\u22122 = -1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 -1\n+ r0 = 1 0 0 0 -1 0 -1 0 0 0 1\nu0 = 0 0 0 0 -1 0 -1 0 -1 0 1\n+ r4 = 1 0 0 0 -1 0 -1 0 0 0 1\nu4 = 0 0 -1 0 -2 0 0 0 0 0 1\n10 Jones Polynomial Invariants\nWe add \u2212r6 to u4 to get the unique representative which yields pRH(A) = \u22122A\n\u22124 \u2212\n2A\u22122 + 1 + A2 + A4 \u2212A6.\nThe linking number of the components of V RH is 1\/2. So pV RH(A) \u2261 \u2212A\u22124 \u2212\nA\u22122. We put it in its standard form by adding \u2212r6 to its coefficient sequence and we get\np\u00afV RH(A) = \u22122A\n\u22124 \u2212 A\u22122 + 1 + A2 \u2212 A6. U2 is the unlink with two components, so\npU2(A) = \u2212A\n\u22122 \u2212A2 and its standard form is pU2(A) = \u2212A\n\u22124 \u2212A\u22122 + 1\u2212A6.\nThese computations show that the polynomials of the three links in figure 9 are mutually\ndifferent. We conclude that the Jones polynomial mod Io of welded (or fused) links is a\nnon-trivial isotopy invariant.\nExample 2. Let L1 and L2 be the two links shown in figure 10. Smoothing a positive\ncrossing between the first and second components and then applying theorem 5, we can\neasily compute pL1(A) \u2261 A\n\u221212 + A\u22124 + 1 + A16 and pL2(A) \u2261 A\n\u22126 + A\u22124 + 1 + A10.\nThese are indeed different polynomials since (pL1 \u2212 pL2)(A) = \u2212A\n\u22122 + 1 + A4 \u2212 A6.\nThis example shows that the Kauffman polynomial is not a function of the total linking\nnumber.\nL\n1\nL\n2\n1 1\n2 2\n3 3\nFigure 10: Two links with the same total linking number\nAcknowledgements\nThe first author would like to thank Roger Fenn, Brian Sanderson and Colin Rourke for\nuseful suggestions and helpful conversations.\nReferences\n[1] R.
