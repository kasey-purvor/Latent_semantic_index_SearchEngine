Introduction \nIn the early 1970s, a group at MIT discovered that when a solidifying alloy was \ncontinuously stirred the viscosity fell to a much lower value than for the static case \n[1]. This was associated with the fact that, during stirring in the semisolid range, the \ndendritic microstructure was destroyed and the semisolid consisted of spheroids of \nsolid in a liquid matrix. In this state, the material behaved thixotropically i.e. when \nsheared it flowed but when allowed to stand it thickened again; the viscosity was a \nfunction both of time at temperature and of shear rate. The behaviour was associated \nwith the dynamic development of microscopic \u2018welds\u2019 between solid spheroids \n(agglomeration) and the break up of these welds under shear (disagglomeration) [2]. It \nbecame the basis of a new range of forming technologies termed collectively \nsemisolid processing. The advantages over conventional die casting including less \nmould attrition, reduced porosity and hence higher part integrity, and near net shape \n(because there is less solidification shrinkage). A range of reviews are available [2-6]. \n \nThere are various types of semisolid processing: \u2018Rheocasting\u2019 refers to the process \nwhere the alloy is cooled into the semi-solid state and injected into a die without an \nintermediate solidification step; \u2018Rheomoulding\u2019 is allied to polymer injection \nmoulding, and uses either a single screw or a twin screw. \u2018Thixo\u2019 usually refers to \nprocesses where an intermediate solidification step does occur. (There are exceptions \nto this e.g. \u2018Thixomolding\u00ae\u2019, which is used to produce magnesium alloy components, \ne.g. for portable computers and cameras). \u2018Thixoforming\u2019 can cover both \n\u2018thixocasting\u2019, \u2018thixoforging\u2019 and an intermediate process called \u2018thixoforming\u2019. \nThixocasting tends to take place with relatively high fractions of liquid and \nthixoforging when the fractions are lower. Thixocasting involves placing the slug of \nsemisolid material in a shot sleeve and injecting into a die. In thixoforging, the slug of \nsemisolid material is placed between dies and the die halves brought together around \nthe slug. In all cases, thixotropic feedstock is required. \n \nThere is a constant drive to move to the \u2018Rheo\u2019 forms of the process because this \neliminates the intermediate solidification step and hence reduces cost. The non-\ndendritic feedstock microstructure can be obtained by a variety of means during \ncooling including mechanical stirring or electromagnetic stirring in the shot sleeve as \nin the New Semi-Solid Metal Casting process from Hitachi [7]. Alternatively, the \nNew RheoCasting (NRC) process (Fig.1) patented by UBE [8,9] involves stimulating \nnucleation of solid particles. Molten alloy is poured, at a temperature slightly above \nthe liquidus, into a tilted steel crucible. In one version of the route this pouring is via a \ncooling slope (Fig.1 step [1]-a) and in the other the pouring is direct (Fig.1 step [1]-b). \nThe alloy is then partially solidified in the mould under controlled cooling conditions, \nwhich includes the application of heat to the mould using an induction heater (stage \n[3] in Fig. 1). This results in a spheroidal microstructure in the semisolid state. The \ntemperature is equalized across the cross-section of the mould and the semisolid slug \nis then upended into the shot sleeve (hence leaving any oxide skin in the discard) and \ninjected into the die to produce the component. There is no need for specially treated \nthixoformable feedstock and scrap can be readily recycled within the plant (as \nopposed to conventional thixoforming where the scrap must be returned to the \nsupplier of the feedstock to be retreated e.g. with the Magneto-Hydro-Dynamic \n(MHD) process).  Hall et al. [9] showed that the NRC route has a lower unit cost than \nthixoforming, due to the lower starting material cost. The principal disadvantage is \nthat the process is relatively inflexible, with the mould size and mould induction \nheating conditions very precisely related to the metered volume of alloy. Thus, the \nprocess is highly suitable for volume production of a particular component where no \nchange in the metered volume is required. It is less suitable for producing components \nof varying sizes where, each time the size changed, a different mould would be \nrequired. The NRC process is gaining increasing industrial attention for high volume \ncomponent production. \n \nKaufmann et al. [10] compared NRC material with that produced by a conventional \ncommercial thixocasting process and found a higher degree of compositional \nhomogeneity and overall globule spheroidicity. It was also shown [11] that for high \nquality slugs, it is important to hold the melt close to the liquidus temperature and to \nquench it quickly to form many nuclei. These are distributed throughout the cup and \ngrow in a globular fashion when two criteria are both fulfilled- the size of the nuclei \nand the temperature gradient in the cup must both be small. Dendritic growth is then \nsuppressed. Uggowitzer and Kaufmann [12] argued that the nuclei are formed by \n\u2018forced homogeneous nucleation\u2019 due to partial quenching of the melt. This was \nbacked up by simulation results from Zhu et al. [13]. Further detail will be given of \nwork in the literature using a cooling slope in the Introduction to the companion \npaper. Here the background on analogue systems is outlined since that is the principal \nconcern of this first paper.  \n \nSemitransparent analogue systems have been used for research into metal \nsolidification because they allow visualisation [14]. The most common analogue \nsystem used in laboratory experiments (and in the present work) is aqueous \nammonium chloride (NH4Cl-H2O) with NH4Cl concentration between 25 and 40 \nwt%. Jackson et al. [14] studied the origin of the grains that comprise the equiaxed \nregion in a conventional casting. When the solution was poured at temperatures close \nto the saturation temperature, crystals appeared throughout the liquid and swirled in a \nsnow storm effect (\u2018big-bang nucleation\u2019). They concluded that, under the interaction \nof heat and matter fluxes during dendritic growth, the partial remelting of dendrites is \nan important mechanism for producing the equiaxed region. Beckerman and Wang \n[15] noted that thermal and solute buoyancy forces cause convection in the melt and \nobserved nucleation, fragmentation, recalescence, multicellular thermosolutal \nconvection and sedimentation of NH4Cl crystals. They used a square cavity evenly \ncooled from the sidewalls. In the initial stages of the experiment, a large number of \nfree crystals were observed in the upper portion of the melt. These originated from \nfragmentation of the crystals at the walls, which were ejected into the bulk melt by the \nconvective flow in the residual solution. \n \nSeveral authors have investigated the effect of the flow behaviour on the solidification \nprocess using analogue systems [16-20]. Paradies et al [19] showed that an imposed \nvelocity in the melt dramatically changed the rate and total amount of crystal \nfragmentation developed. In other work with succinonitrile\/acetone [21], it was found \nthat increasing the velocity of forced flow in a tube increases the rate of recalescence \nbut the largest cumulative total of fragments was produced with an intermediate rate \nof flow. Mullis et al [22] examined the formation of spheroidal microstructures for \nsemisolid processing with a glass vessel and made observations as a function of \ncooling rate. They observed large dendritic crystals at a high cooling rate, but even at \nthe lowest cooling rate employed, no evidence of the rosette or spheroidal structures \ncharacteristic of metallic systems solidified under applied shear was found. \n \nThe distinctive feature of the work described here is that the vessel is tilted with the \nlower side wall subject to cooling. This mimics the arrangement in Fig. 1 Step [1] (b) \nwhere the melt is poured directly into the tilted mould. It also provides some insight \ninto microstructural development with the cooling slope (Fig. 1 Step [1] (a)) during \nthe initial stages of pouring into the tilted vessel. The aim is to draw out the \nobservations which are relevant to the NRC process. \n \n2. Experimental method  \n \nAmmonium chloride of ACS grade (99.5%) was used. A partial phase diagram is \nshown in Fig. 2 with relevant compositions. Experiments were performed with \nsolution concentrations of 28, 30, 35 and 40wt% NH4Cl with liquidus temperatures of \n22, 31, 55 and 78\u02da C respectively. The total volume of solution was kept at 100ml for \nall concentrations.  \n \nThe perspex test cell is shown in Fig. 3, and incorporates a stainless steel chill wall \npolished to a 1 \u03bcm diamond finish.  The wall was cooled with circulating cold water \nto between 14 and 16\u02daC i.e. about 30\u02daC above the eutectic temperature of -15.4\u02daC. \nCrystallisation was filmed with a high speed JVC video camera. In the first set of \nexperiments, in order to monitor the temperature, a K-type thermocouple was located \nat the bottom of the test cell (Fig. 4). The tilt angles used for experiments are shown \nin Fig. 4. \n \nThe procedure to carry out the experiments was as follows. 100 ml of solution \ncontaining 28, 30, 35 or 40wt% NH4Cl in water was first prepared in a beaker. This \nwas heated and stirred on a hot plate and the temperature checked with a \nthermometer. The heating was continued until all the crystals had dissolved and the \nsolution had reached the desired temperature. This temperature was maintained for 5 \nmore minutes. Meanwhile the water flow had been circulating through the back of the \nchill wall in the test cell for at least ten minutes. The solution was then poured into the \ntransparent cell down the wall. Results for the tilted cell are compared with those \nwhere the chill wall is vertical. The experimental conditions are shown in Table 1. \n \n3. Experimental Results \n \nTypical results for the tilted wall are shown in Figs. 5 and 6. Once the solution was \npoured into the test cell, the crystallisation process started at the chill wall. Nuclei \nformed on the stainless steel plate with no discernible pattern and no apparent \npreferential nucleation (e.g. on residual scratches). Small particles formed on the wall \nand then rolled down the wall towards the bottom.  \n \nVideosequences are available on application to the corresponding author. Examining \nthe behaviour with a relatively high superheat (13K, 30wt% NH4Cl, tilt angle 45\u02da) \nshows that particles are of various sizes when they start to roll. The time of residence \non the chill wall therefore depends not only on size and therefore flow forces must be \noperating as well as gravitational forces. Comparing results for 45\u02da and 60\u02da tilt angles \n(35%NH4Cl solution, 10K superheat- see Figs. 7 and 8) shows that, with the 45\u02da  tilt \nangle, as expected, the initial particles rolled down more slowly than with the higher \ntilt angle. Columnar dendritic growth on the chill wall was therefore more evident for \nthe 45\u02da results (note that this can be seen by eye but is not visible in the figure because \nof the video resolution). Columnar dendrites tended to develop after the first 40s or \nso. \n \nLow superheat leads to copious nucleation (Fig. 9) with small particles on both the \nchill wall and nucleating in the bulk solution. Over time these initial crystals settle \nand dendritic growth develops. The higher initial NH4Cl concentrations (35wt% and \n40wt%) also give more copious nucleation than the lower concentrations. \n \nIn experiments with a vertical chill wall (Fig. 10), the numbers of nuclei in the bulk \nquickly increase in the first stages. Some of these appear to have originated in the \nbulk and some from fragmentation of crystals at the wall. Crystals tend to congregate \nin the upper portion of the melt during the first five minutes and then descend slowly, \nbecoming entrained in the thermally driven downward flow of fluid adjacent to the \ncrystallisation front. Some of the crystals become lodged in the liquidus front of the \nmushy zone (Fig. 10(b)). Crystals rotating in the flow in the bulk tend to show a \nsymmetric dendritic morphology whilst those attached to the cooling slope are \ncolumnar. Comparing results for the vertical chill wall with those for the tilted wall, \nthe cooling wall is more effective in promoting crystallisation in the latter case, the \nhigh concentration of fine crystals formed during initial contact with the mould wall \nbecoming redistributed through the liquid. This effect is counteracted if the superheat \nis too high (say 15K) because the crystallites tend to redissolve when they move out \ninto the bulk solution.  \n \n4. Discussion \n \nThe essential aim of the NRC process is to obtain a spheroidal morphology uniformly \nacross the casting, albeit after a process of equilibration (Fig. 1 steps [3]-a and [3]-b) \nwhere heat is transferred whilst the mould is being held in the semi-solid state in a \nvertical position. Here the experiments focus on the initial stages of the process, rather \nthan the equilibration (i.e. Fig. 1 stages [1] and [2]). In addition, in the aqueous \nammonium chloride system there is a substantial density difference between the \ncrystals and the liquid, giving rise to settling, which does not exist to the same extent \nfor solidification in aluminium alloys. Given these provisos, the following points can \nbe made: \n1) The higher initial NH4Cl concentrations (35wt% and 40wt%) and lower \nsuperheats (1-5K) tend to give more copious nucleation, as would be expected \n(schematically shown in Fig. 11(a)). Low superheat enhances crystal survival, \npartly through a reduction in thermal convection. The superheat results are \nsignificant for the NRC process. Lower initial concentrations and higher \nsuperheats tend to produce gradual columnar dendritic solidification \n(schematically shown in Fig. 11(b) and (c)).   \n2) Crystals nucleating on the chill wall are observed to roll down the wall after a \ncertain residence time. This raises the interesting issue as to the importance of the \nsurface finish on the chill wall. This should not occur to the same extent in the \nNRC case where there is little density difference between the crystal and the \nliquid. However, the surface finish of the chilling surface will play an important \nrole in determining how easy it is for crystals to become detached from the chill \nwall and incorporated into the fluid flow. \n3) Increasing tilt angle from 45\u02da  to 60\u02da tends to increase the speed at which particles \nroll down the wall and therefore enhance the possibility of equiaxed formation \nrather than columnar dendritic growth. This again has important implications for \nthe NRC process, either in terms of the tilt of the mould (for direct pouring) or the \ntilt of the cooling slope. However, there will be an optimum angle for enhancing \nequiaxed formation beyond which the chill wall is not able to play as significant a \nrole in nucleation.  \nThe observations on the morphology of the crystals in the bulk are consistent with \nwork by Appolaire et al. [25] who showed that crystals rotating in the flow tend to be \nsymmetric, whilst those which are not become asymmetric. \n \nIn a companion paper [26], the results for pouring A356 aluminium alloy directly \ninto a mould, and also via a cooling slope into a mould, are presented. The \nobservations with the transparent analogue provide insight into the phenomena which \nare occurring. \n    \nSummary and Concluding Remarks \n \nThe aim here was to visualise the initial stages of the solidification processes in New \nRheocasting (NRC) with aluminium alloys through the use of a transparent aqueous \nammonium chloride analogue. The ammonium chloride has been poured into a \nperspex cell with one wall chilled. This mimics the mould and the cooling slope in the \nNRC process, although there is a substantial density difference between the crystals \nand the remaining liquid in the ammonium chloride system which leads to some \nsettling which does not occur with aluminium alloys. Higher initial NH4Cl \nconcentrations (35wt% and 40wt%) and lower superheats (1-5K) tend to give more \ncopious nucleation, as would be expected. The superheat results are significant for the \nNRC process. Crystals nucleating on the chill wall roll down the wall after a certain \nresidence time. The surface finish of the chill wall (cooling slope) may therefore be \nimportant in determining how easy it is for crystals to become detached from the chill \nwall and incorporated into the fluid flow. Increasing the tilt angle (up to a point \nbeyond which the chill wall is not able to play a full role in enhancing nucleation) \ntends to increase the speed at which particles roll down the wall and therefore to \nenhance the possibility of equiaxed formation rather than columnar dendritic growth. \nA companion paper gives results for pouring A356 aluminium alloy directly into a \nmould and also into a mould via a cooling sliope.  \n \nAcknowledgements \nECL would like to acknowledge financial support provided by CONACyt and SEP \nand also the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma del Estado de Hidalgo for support.

Step [1] is the holding furnace \nwith pouring into a tilted mould via either a cooling slope ([1]-a) or directly ([1]-b). In \nstep [2] the mould is brought up to vertical. In step [3] controlled cooling is taking \nplace, with some heat input from an induction heater. The material is in the semi-solid \nstate with a gradual increase in solid content. In step [3]-c, the mould is upended so \nthat the semi-solid material moves into a shot sleeve. In step [4], the material is \ninjected into a die.  \n \nFig. 2. H2O-NH4Cl phase diagram.
