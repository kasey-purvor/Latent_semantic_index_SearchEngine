Hence the sensed state of the system (the set of\nvariables including limb segment positions and velocities that\ncapture its behaviour) always lags behind its true state [1].\nThese delays vary with the sensory modality but can be\nsubstantial, and estimates of the delay involved in using visual\nfeedback to control and correct ongoing movements vary\nfrom about 100\u2013300 ms [2\u20135]. In addition, any physiological\nsensor will have some inaccuracies, compounded by neural\nnoise, that lead to errors in the measurements. Furthermore,\nthe parameters that the CNS might aim to control, such as the\nposition or velocity of the peripheral motor system, are often\nhidden from the CNS by indirect relationships between these\nperipheral variables (muscle lengths or joint angles) and the\nsensory encoders. For example, vertebrate joint angles are\nencoded mainly in information carried by muscle spindles,\nwhich can only provide a mixed signal that is proportional to\nmuscle length and its rate of change. To measure and control\nthe kinematics of a movement requires decoding these\nafferent signals to estimate joint angles from muscle lengths.\nIn addition, combining an independent prediction of the\nstate of the peripheral apparatus with afferent measurements\nof its state can provide an estimate that is more accurate than\nthat of either predictor or sensors alone [6]. For these various\nreasons, it is widely assumed that the brain generates an\nestimate of the true state of the peripheral motor system, by\nintegration of the latest afferent sensory information with an\nefferent copy of motor commands using prior knowledge of\nthe relationships between efferent signals and the subsequent\nsensory reafference [7\u201310]. The process of translating an\nefferent copy of a motor command into predicted sensory\nreafference is encapsulated by the idea of a forward model\n[7,11]. A forward model receives efferent copies of the motor\ncommands and also receives sensory inputs that describe the\nmotor state. The output of the model is a prediction of the\nsensory consequences of the motor command, i.e., a\nprediction of the change in motor state. State estimation\nmust be a predictive process because of central delays in\nprocessing of the motor command, in peripheral conduction\nof the efferent signal, and in neuromuscular excitation-\ncontraction coupling. Hence the true motor state of the\nmotor periphery lags behind the central (CNS) changes in\nmotor commands. The state estimation process is therefore\ninseparably coupled to the process of forward modelling [11].\nForward modelling has been proposed to be a key function\nof the cerebellum [7,12,13], and the cerebellum has been\nspeci\ufb01cally linked to state estimation [14,15], possibly in\nconjunction with the superior parietal cortex [4,16\u201318]. The\ncerebellum receives appropriate ascending proprioceptive\ninputs and the efferent copies of descending motor com-\nmands, and it outputs to cortical and brain stem motor nuclei\n[12]. It also has the necessary adaptive mechanisms to support\nthis hypothesised role, because the forward model predic-\ntions must be re\ufb01ned and maintained by experience-based\nmotor learning [11,12]. However, to date, there has been no\ndirect experimental evidence of this cerebellar contribution\nto state estimation; indirect evidence has been derived from\nbrain imaging [19\u201322] and from studies of cerebellar patients\nwith chronic lesions [23\u201325].\nAcademic Editor: James Ashe, University of Minnesota, United States of America\nReceived July 11, 2007; Accepted September 28, 2007; Published November 27,\n2007\nCopyright: \u0002 2007 Miall et al.

Thus a rapid reaching action made\nwithout state estimation of the moving hand would tend to\novershoot its target, because information that the desired\ntarget had been reached would only arrive at the CNS after\nthe hand had passed beyond. This would result in movement\nerrors analogous to the hypometria of cerebellar patients\n[12]. State estimation is also important for the synchronous\nand coordinated activation of different motor effectors. If the\nfuture state of one effector can be predicted, then control\nsignals to the other can be issued to produce simultaneous\nactions, which are a key feature of coordinated action.\nWithout these predictions, the two effectors could only be\ncontrolled reactively [23,24], after measurement of the\noutcome of each command. The loss of coordination and\nasynchrony of joint actions that would be expected from a\nfailure of state estimation are again similar to the poorly\ncoordinated and ataxic movements of cerebellar subjects\n[12,26,27]. Thus, there is theoretical and experimental\nevidence to suggest that the cerebellum is involved in state\nestimation. To date, we are aware of no studies that have\ndirectly tested this hypothesis by experimental disruption of\nthe cerebellum.\nSo, to further test the hypothesis that the human\ncerebellum is involved in the generation of a state estimate,\nwe have used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over\nthe ipsilateral cerebellum during voluntary arm actions to\nbrie\ufb02y disturb its function. We used a task in which humans\nwere required to make a slow, lateral, but untargeted\nmovement with their arm before being suddenly cued to\nmake a rapid pointing movement towards a static target.\nAccurate reaching in these circumstances requires up-to-date\nknowledge of the arm\u2019s moving position at the moment of the\ngo cue. Any failure to estimate the arm\u2019s initial state caused\nby the cerebellar TMS should be evident as inaccurate\nmovement. However, because of its location, the human\ncerebellum is dif\ufb01cult to stimulate with transcranial coils, and\nTMS targeted at the lateral cerebellum can also directly\nstimulate neck muscles, the brachial plexus, muscles in the\nneck or shoulder, and is suf\ufb01ciently loud that it can provide a\nstartling stimulus affecting speed of movement onset. We\nhave used a series of control conditions to separate non-\nspeci\ufb01c effects from a speci\ufb01c change in initial movement\ndirection and in terminal error, which were seen only with\ncerebellar TMS.\nResults\nParticipants viewed a virtual image of a static target in\nthree-dimensional (3-D) space ahead of them, and started\neach trial by lifting their right index \ufb01nger from a start key\nand moving steadily towards their right (Figure 1A). Liquid\ncrystal device (LCD) goggles blocked the view of their hand\nand of the target as soon at the start key was released. An\nauditory go cue, 500-1500 ms after trial onset, instructed\nthem to make a rapid upwards- and leftwards- pointing\nmovement to the virtual target. Their index \ufb01nger had\ntypically moved laterally 10\u201340 cm from its original position\nwhen the go cue was delivered (Figure 1B). Final positional\nerrors on control trials were small (Figure 1B) and averaged\n4.2 cm across all conditions. Thus, participants were normally\nable to compensate for their initial lateral arm motion and\nreach the target despite the lack of visual feedback. Vision\nwas allowed after the reach-to-target motion was complete,\navoiding any slow drifting of accuracy across trials. However,\non a random 50% of trials in each block, TMS was delivered\nwithin their reaction time after the auditory go cue, in order\nto disrupt the planning and initiation of the reach-to-target\nmovement. Reaction times for control trials without TMS\naveraged 265 ms (discussed later), but were reduced to 170 ms\nduring TMS trials; the three TMS pulses were delivered at 50,\n100, and 150 ms during this interval.\nCerebellar TMS Increases Final Error\nThe short train of three TMS pulses delivered over the\nlateral cerebellum caused a signi\ufb01cant within-subject increase\nin mean error for TMS trials compared with non-TMS trials.\nIn our initial experiments, we tested eight participants with\nTMS over the right ipsilateral cerebellum, the contralateral\n(left) motor cortex, and the ipsilateral neck, using separate\nrecording sessions separated by at least one day. The mean\nincrease in end-point errors with the cerebellar stimulation\nsite was 36% (2.26 cm 6 0.37 standard error of the mean\n[SEM], n \u00bc 8, t(7) \u00bc 5.72, p , 0.0001), and was signi\ufb01cantly\nhigher than the other two conditions (repeated measures\nanalysis of variance [ANOVA], F(2,14) \u00bc 4.468, p \u00bc 0.032).\nHowever, this reduction in pointing accuracy could have\nbeen a nonspeci\ufb01c effect of the TMS stimulation, which can\nbe uncomfortable and even startling. To include other\ncontrol conditions, we then expanded our cerebellar test\ngroup to a total of 32 participants, testing each participant in\nthis main condition of interest as well as in one or more other\nconditions. Because the extra participants were not tested in\nall other stimulation conditions, the following analyses are\nreported as between-group comparisons.\nWith this expanded dataset (Figure 2A), the increase in\nmean terminal errors in cerebellar TMS trials compared to\nnon-TMS trials was reduced from 36% to 23.7% (or 1.71 cm\n6 0.144 SEM, n \u00bc 32, t(31) \u00bc 3.80, p , 0.001). However, this\nTMS-induced error was still signi\ufb01cantly higher when\nPLoS Biology | www.plosbiology.org November 2007 | Volume 5 | Issue 11 | e3162734\nState Estimation in the Cerebellum\nAuthor Summary\nMotor control depends on the brain\u2019s awareness of the current state\nof the body. Knowing the current position and movement of the\narm, for example, allows one to reach rapidly and accurately towards\na target. However, sensory information reaches the brain only after a\nshort delay, and the arm may already be in motion. Therefore, it has\nbeen proposed that the brain must calculate a \u2018\u2018state estimate\u2019\u2019\u2014by\ncombining sensory information about the last known position of the\narm with predictions of its responses to recent movement\ncommands\u2014which it uses to accurately plan and control a reaching\nmovement. To test this idea, we used transcranial magnetic\nstimulation to briefly disrupt several separate areas in the brain as\nparticipants reached to a target. We show that stimulation over the\ncerebellum caused reaching errors consistent with movements\nplanned on the arm\u2019s position about 140 ms previously, whereas\nstimulation of other brain areas did not disrupt reaching direction.\nThese results add weight to the hypothesis that the cerebellum\npredicts the state of the motor system. This hypothesis can explain\nthe loss of movement control experienced by cerebellar patients\nand supports computational theories that the cerebellum is a\npredictive model of the motor system.\ncompared with stimulation lower on the neck (1.12 cm, n \u00bc\n11), or over the hotspot in the primary motor cortex for\ninducing visible twitches in the \ufb01rst dorsal interosseous\nmuscle in the hand (1.23 cm, n \u00bc 21), and higher than when\nstartling auditory clicks were presented either using the TMS\ncoil over the ear or using ear phones without TMS (1.18 cm, n\n\u00bc 4 and 7, respectively). It was also higher than with\nstimulation over the contralateral posterior parietal cortex\n(1.07 cm, n\u00bc 12), which was targeted using the coordinates of\nthe P3 electrode in the 10\u201320 electroencephalogram (EEG)\nelectrode positioning scheme [28]. A one-way ANOVA with\n\ufb01ve conditions (cerebellum, neck, startle, parietal, and motor\ncortical stimulation) was signi\ufb01cant (F(4,78)\u00bc 3.79, p\u00bc 0.007,\nand post-hoc comparisons of the cerebellar condition with\nthe other four conditions were all signi\ufb01cant, p , 0.025). The\ndifference from stimulation over the hand area of the\ncontralateral motor cortex was smallest (p\u00bc 0.025); the other\nfour control conditions were not signi\ufb01cantly separable from\neach other (p . 0.27)]. Thus, whereas each of these sites\ninduced some increase in end-point error, presumably due to\nthe nonspeci\ufb01c effects of the stimulation, the effects caused\nby stimulation over the ipsilateral cerebellum were most\npronounced and statistically reliable\nThe increase in error was partly due to a 14% increase in\nend-point variability across trials. However, the RMS end-\npoint standard deviation measured across all three dimen-\nsions was not signi\ufb01cantly different for any of the \ufb01ve\nconditions (p . 0.103). There was also a signi\ufb01cant end-point\nFigure 1.

This corresponds with a small\nhypermetric overshoot and a small directional error; the\nincrease in overall amplitude of the reach-to-target move-\nment did not reach statistical signi\ufb01cance (p \u00bc 0.14).\nBaseline Performance Differences\nOur analysis compares within-subject average errors across\nsessions including 30 TMS and 30 non-TMS trials. To\nestimate the expected level of difference between these\nmeans due to random sampling from a distribution of\nvariable movements, we analysed the training data for 18\nparticipants before TMS was applied. In training, the TMS\nmachine was placed behind the participant and was triggered\nexactly as in the test sessions, so that its activation was audible\nto the participants but had no direct effect. Trials were then\ngrouped by TMS activation versus nonactivation. As ex-\npected, there were no signi\ufb01cant differences between move-\nment trajectories, reaction times, or peak velocities of the\nmovements. The mean terminal errors differed by 0.40 cm\n(60.1 cm SEM, n \u00bc 18) and the average spatial separation of\nthe mean end positions in the two data sets was 0.8 cm (60.09\ncm SEM, n \u00bc 18). This suggests that random sampling of any\none of our datasets would produce differences representing\nabout half of that seen in our control conditions (Figure 2),\nand less than a quarter of the effect seen for TMS over the\ncerebellum. Moreover, these \ufb01gures (50% and 25%) are\nconservative, based on 18 training sets compared with the\ntotal sample of 32 for the cerebellum and about 10\u201312 for\nFigure 3.

The larger datasets would be less affected by\nrandom sampling.\nTMS Effect Is Exposed by Dynamic State Change\nTMS took place during the reaction time between the go\ncue and the start of the reach-to-target movement, while the\nhand was being actively moved towards the right. Thus, the\nTMS-induced error for the cerebellar stimulation condition\nis, we hypothesize, due to the disruption of the state\nestimation process within the ipsilateral cerebellum and\nwould affect the estimation during the current rightwards\nmovement. If true, then the effect should not be seen if the\nneed for state estimation was minimized. We therefore\ncompared TMS stimulation at the same cerebellar location\nbut with the participant holding their arm stationary at the\nmoment of cue onset. In this control condition, the starting\nbutton was shifted 20 cm laterally, to be coincident with the\nmean start position of the hand in other conditions, and the\nparticipant was instructed to lift the \ufb01nger from the start\nbutton but to then remain stationary until the auditory go\ncue. Hence the starting position was known and static prior\nto cue onset. A reach-to-target from this \ufb01xed position would\nnot require renewed state-estimation because the state was\nconstant and up to date throughout the reaction time period.\nEnd point errors were signi\ufb01cantly lower in this condition\nthan with cerebellar stimulation (0.92 cm, n\u00bc 9) and were not\nsigni\ufb01cantly different from the other control conditions\n(Figure 2). Hence the TMS-induced effect is speci\ufb01c to those\nconditions in which the initial state of the arm is dynamically\nchanging, when its true state must be estimated,\nCerebellar TMS Causes Initial Aiming Error\nThe duration of the cued reach-to-target movement was\nabout 725 ms (723.5 ms with TMS over the cerebellum, 725.9\nms without), allowing time for an initial error in the onset of\nthe reach to be corrected during its execution. Hence,\nalthough they are signi\ufb01cant, the \ufb01nal errors reported above\nmay only re\ufb02ect a small part of the disruption caused by the\nTMS. We therefore measured the angular deviation in the\ninitiation of the reach-to-target movement. Individual trials\nstarted from different positions (Figure 1B), so we measured\nfor each trial the angular difference between two lines\u2014one\njoining target position to the hand position at the start of the\nreach-to-target, and one joining the starting hand position to\nits position at maximum velocity\u2014and we compared this\nangle within participants across TMS versus non-TMS trials\n(see Methods). Because the hand was travelling in a predom-\ninantly rightwards direction at cue onset (with the average\nspeed in that direction 760% greater than upwards, and\n490% greater than forwards), we expect the errors to be most\nprominent in azimuth angle (Figure 1B)\nFor stimulation over the cerebellum, the 5.138 (60.488 SEM)\ndifference in azimuth was highly signi\ufb01cant (Figure 4A, one-\nsample t-test, t(32)\u00bc10.58, p , 0.0001). The azimuth angle\ndifferences between groups were also highly signi\ufb01cant [one-\nway ANOVA (F(4,78) \u00bc 5.43, p \u00bc 0.001; post-hoc LSD t-test\ncomparisons showed the cerebellar stimulation condition\ndiffered from all others (p , 0.013); the other four control\nconditions were not signi\ufb01cantly separable from each other (p\n. 0.45)]. In all \ufb01ve conditions, the changes in elevation angle\nbetween stimulated and normal trials were not signi\ufb01cantly\ndifferent from each other [Figure 4B, one-way ANOVA\n(F(4,78) \u00bc 1.11, p \u00bc 0.36; post-hoc LSD t-test comparisons\nshowed no signi\ufb01cant differences (p . 0.22), except between\ncerebellar and parietal stimulation, which approached\nsigni\ufb01cance (p \u00bc 0.06, uncorrected)]. Hence TMS over the\ncerebellum induced a signi\ufb01cant change in the initial\ndirection of the targeted reach, which was partly but not\nfully corrected by the end of the movement (Figure 3A).\nTesting the differences in the training datasets, where TMS\nwas distant from the head and thus ineffective, we found that\nthe mean azimuth angle differences between the two sets of\ntrials was 0.38, which is approximately 6% of the difference\nrecorded for cerebellar TMS, and not signi\ufb01cantly different\nfrom zero (one-sample t-tests, p \u00bc 0.7, n \u00bc 18).\nDirection Specificity\nThe direction of the initial pointing error (a clockwise\ndeviation relative to non-TMS trials) suggests that the\nreaching movement towards the target was inaccurately\nplanned. We distinguish two possible reasons. One is that\nthere could be a direction-speci\ufb01c effect due to mislocation\nof the arm at the initiation of the targeted reach, during the\nrightwards movement from the start key. If the reach-to-\ntarget movement was planned based on out-of-date informa-\ntion, i.e., on an estimated start position leftwards of the actual\nposition of the hand, then the movement direction would be\nrotated clockwise. To test this hypothesis more directly, we\nFigure 4.

This group showed end-point error amplitudes\n(mean 1.88 cm, n \u00bc 13) inseparable from the original\ncerebellar group (1.71 cm, n\u00bc 32), and as before, signi\ufb01cantly\ngreater than all the other control conditions (Figure 2, one-\nway ANOVA, F(5,69) \u00bc 3.57, p \u00bc 0.006, post-hoc t-tests p ,\n0.005). The mean azimuth angle was \u00022.848, in other words,\nrotated counterclockwise, and hence statistically different\nfrom all other conditions (Figure 4A, p , 0.025); the mean\nelevation angle did not differ from other conditions (Figure\n4B, p . 0.19).\nThe second possibility is that the TMS caused the\nparticipants to mislocate the target, and they were therefore\naccurately reaching to the wrong location. We can dismiss\nthis with the stationary start position data. In this case, there\nwas very little azimuth error (1.748, not signi\ufb01cantly different\nfrom all other control conditions), and the end point errors\nwere actually the smallest observed. In addition, we corre-\nlated the directional errors in azimuth and elevation for both\ngroups (cerebellar TMS during rightwards and leftwards\nmovements) against the end-point errors in the x-, y-, and z-\naxis (Figure 1). We hypothesize that if TMS caused target\nmislocation, then the initial angular deviations would be\ncorrelated with the \ufb01nal positional errors. However, we found\nno evidence to support this: there was only one near-\nsigni\ufb01cant correlation between change in azimuth angle\nand change in x error during leftwards movement condition\n(p \u00bc 0.061, Bonferroni adjusted); this is not the axis in which\nchanges in azimuth angle would be most prominent, given the\nnear-vertical plane of movements (Figure 1).\nThus we interpret this as further evidence that the initial\ndirection was inaccurate and that some but not all of this\nerror was corrected during the reach. We \ufb01nd no evidence\nthat the \ufb01nal position was mislocated and that the initial\nangles were altered to reach this \ufb01nal location.\nEstimating the Internal Error in Hand State\nTo estimate the hand state used to plan the reach-to-target\naction, we could backtrack along the mean trajectory of non-\nTMS trials, participant by participant, to \ufb01nd a point at which\nthe angle towards the maximum velocity position was equal\nto the mean angular deviation seen for that participant in\nTMS trials. In other words, by assuming that the angular error\nin aiming to the target was due to a failure of the cerebellar\nstate estimation of the hand position, during the initial slow\nmovement, we found that the prior position of the hand\u2014\nbefore the go cue\u2014at which the angular difference between\nstart and maximum velocity points would be the same as was\nfound between TMS and non-TMS trials. This position was\n3.97 cm (6 1.01 SEM) leftwards of the actual reach-to-target\nstart position (black dot, Figure 3A). Converting from\npositional differences along their mean path between TMS\nand non-TMS trials, and given the mean hand speed at the\ncue onset, measured subject-by-subject, the distance of 3.97\ncm suggests that the reach-to-target was planned based on the\nhand\u2019s position 138 ms (619 ms SEM) previously. This \u2018\u2018state-\nestimation interval\u2019\u2019 is signi\ufb01cantly greater than zero (one-\nsample t-test, t(18)\u00bc 7.33, p , 0.0001) and is also greater than\nthe change in reaction time caused by the TMS (one-tailed\npaired-sample t-test, t(18)\u00bc 2.011, p\u00bc 0.030; see \u2018\u2018nonspeci\ufb01c\neffects\u2019\u2019 below). For the group tested making initially left-\nwards arm movement, the \u2018\u2018state-estimation interval\u2019\u2019 was\nalmost exactly the same, 134 ms (617 ms SEM). This\nprediction interval cannot be calculated for the stationary-\nstart condition, because backtracking on a stationary trajec-\ntory is not possible.\nOther Nonspecific Stimulation Effects\nThe velocity pro\ufb01les of the reach-to-target movements\nwere signi\ufb01cantly altered by cerebellar TMS (Figure 6A\u20136C).\nThe effect was to reduce the reaction time for the rapid\nreach-to-target movement by about 80 ms and to increase the\npeak velocity by about 15%. For the main condition of\ninterest, with TMS over the lateral cerebellum during\nongoing movement, the mean reaction time for TMS versus\nnon-TMS trials was 172.5 ms versus 265.9 ms. TMS-induced\nstartle effects have been reported previously [29] because of\nthe noise and cutaneous stimulation. TMS over the cerebel-\nlum using the large double-cone coils does cause noticeable\nauditory stimulation, as well as cutaneous and muscular\nstimulation. Very similar effects on the movement pro\ufb01les\nwere seen in a control group (Figure 6D) tested with TMS\nstimulation over the right ear (n\u00bc4) or with startling auditory\nwhite noise bursts played over headphones (n\u00bc7), con\ufb01rming\nthat the reduction in reaction time and increase in peak\nvelocity is likely to be due to a startle response. For this startle\ncontrol group (n\u00bc 11), the mean reaction time was 175.2 ms\nFigure 5.

Consid-\nerably weaker effects were seen for TMS stimulation over the\nneck (Figure 6E), the motor cortex (Figure 6F), or posterior\nparietal cortex (Figure 6G). The reduced reaction time seen\nfor motor cortical TMS has also seen in other TMS experi-\nments [30,31] and is attributed to an alerting but nonstartling\neffect of the TMS stimulus.\nTime to maximum velocity after the onset of the reach-to-\ntarget movement was similar (247 ms versus 258 ms for\ncerebellar TMS versus non-TMS trials and 227 ms versus 250\nms for startle versus nonstartle trials). Overall movement\nduration was nonsigni\ufb01cantly shorter in the TMS or startle\ntrials. For the cerebellar group, mean duration was 723 ms for\nTMS trials and 726 ms for non-TMS trials. For the startle\ngroup, mean duration was 693 ms versus 726 ms. Thus, there\nwas a subtle increase in the deceleration phase of the\nmovement.\nDiscussion\nWe have shown that a brief train of TMS over the lateral\ncerebellum, applied during the reaction time to initiate a\nrapid reaching movement towards a remembered target,\nresulted in a directional deviation of the reaching movement\nand in increased positional error. We suggest that the TMS\ntemporarily blocked the contribution of the lateral cerebel-\nlum to state estimation. As a result, the reaching movements\nwere planned based on the residual, out-of-date knowledge of\nthe previous state of the arm. Thus, we propose that during\nrightwards arm movements the arm was estimated to be\nfurther leftwards than its true position, while during left-\nwards movement it was estimated to be further rightwards.\nThese errors lead to clockwise and counterclockwise direc-\ntional deviation of the initial movement towards the target.\nWhen the arm was stationary at movement onset and hence\nFigure 6.

These forward model predictions, com-\nbined with independent sensory information from the\nperiphery, provide an optimal estimate of the current state\nof the arm. However, there is considerable debate about the\nrole of the cerebellum in motor control [14,20,34,35] and\nother functions, such as timing, motor learning, predictive\ncontrol, and inverse dynamic modelling, have all been\nproposed. We believe the present data are best understood\nin the context of state estimation. First, predictive control\n[36,37] is very closely related to state estimation, because the\nconsequences of motor commands must be predicted in\norder to update and control subsequent actions. Hence state\nestimation is a subset of predictive control [1]. Next, the\ncerebellum appears important in timing, especially during\ndiscrete motor tasks [38,39]. The timing component of our\ntask is minimal as movements were initiated after a random\ninterval, eliminating a timing strategy and participants were\ninstructed to reach as fast as possible after the go cue.\nFurthermore, the target was static, and so the directional\ndifferences in reaching behaviour in TMS versus non-TMS\ntrials are dif\ufb01cult to justify by timing alone.\nAnother important postulated function is in inverse\ndynamic modelling, with a functional role for the cerebellum\nin generating motor commands rather than in predicting\ntheir outcome [7,33,40]. Again, the pattern of results we have\nshown is not easily \ufb01t by this hypothesis. In particular, the\nreach-to-target from a stationary position was not different\nfrom control conditions, whereas disruption of an inverse\nmodel would affect all movement for which the model was\nused. These data also argue against an explanation that the\nTMS impaired control of interjoint dynamics. Failure to\ncompensate for interjoint dynamics, which has been pro-\nposed as an explanation for cerebellar ataxia [27], might\ncontribute to our results, as limb dynamics would be different\nfor the movements made from left and right. However, the\ninitial movements were relatively slow (mean velocity 27.9 cm\/\ns, Figure 6) and so these dynamic effects would be small in\ncomparison to their effects during the much faster reach-to-\ntarget action. Indeed, the reach-to-target made from the\nstatic position was as rapid (peak velocities of about 100 cm\/s,\nFigure 6C) as in other conditions and, we assume, was fast\nenough to expose weak interjoint coordination. Its trajectory\nwas not different from the control conditions. But whether\nthese effects contribute more subtly to our overall results will\nrequire further work, perhaps using faster baseline move-\nments so that both the dynamic effects and the positional\nmisestimation are larger.\nIt is also thought that state estimation is required to\nminimize timing differences between effectors during coor-\ndinated actions [41,42]. Loss of coordination is one of the\ncardinal symptoms of cerebellar dysfunction [43] and is\nevident as gross ataxia as well as in more subtle measures such\nas the failure to coordinate grip and lift forces during object\nmanipulation [23,24,44]. Recently, Deidrichsen et al. tested\ncoordination of a reach and a button press and were able to\nseparate experimentally time-dependent and state-depend-\nent behavioural strategies. They found that functional\nactivation changes in the lateral cerebellum were better\nexplained by state estimation than by timing [45], consistent\nwith the present results.\nOur estimates of the angular deviations imply that the\nrapid reaching movements were planned on information that\nis about 138 ms out of date, an interval that is in the\nappropriate order of magnitude of sensory reafference\n[2,3,5]. From this result, we would predict that cerebellar\npathology would lead to movement control based on the\narm\u2019s state about 138 ms less advanced than actual. This\nwould result in direction- and speed-speci\ufb01c deviations in the\ninitial segment of any rapid movement, especially those made\nduring ongoing action, as we have shown here. It would also\nlead to hypermetria, as the state estimate would be disturbed\nthroughout the reaching movement, rather than just at its\ninitiation. Thus, even the \ufb01nal stages of reaching to a target\nwould be affected more obviously than we have seen in our\nexperiments, where, we suspect, the TMS-induced disruption\nof state estimate was brief and may have largely recovered by\nthe end of the reaching action. The consequences of\nexperimentally delaying visual feedback, which effectively\nmakes the state estimate inaccurate with respect to actual\nfeedback, are similar to that of cerebellar inactivation [2,46].\nDelayed state estimation would therefore explain loss of\ncoordination and ataxia.\nThe state estimation process is likely to be iterative [8], with\nthe current state being updated by an optimised weighting of\nafferent proprioceptive and visual information and by\nefferent motor commands. An iterative calculation is\noptimal, because previous state estimates, even if inaccurate,\nprovide an additional source of information to be used in the\nnew estimate. This is particularly true for physiological\nsystems in which the state cannot change instantly; there\nmust be a strong correlation between previous state and new\nstates. We cannot tell from the present results to whether the\n138 ms interval re\ufb02ects \u2018\u2018freezing\u2019\u2019 of the state estimate, until\nthe cerebellum generates a new estimate, or whether it\nre\ufb02ects the fall-back use of out-of-date proprioceptive and\nvisual information. Possible methods to address this question\nwould involve using longer trains of TMS, to stretch the time\nthat it was perturbed, or to use repetitive TMS to induce a\ntemporary \u2018\u2018virtual lesion\u2019\u2019, coupled with adaptation to\ndelayed visual feedback.\nHowever another important issue is whether the state\nestimate is localized entirely within the cerebellum or is\ndistributed across this and other areas. One obvious\ncandidate, given its well-documented role in spatial repre-\nsentations, is the posterior parietal cortex [47\u201349]. It has also\nbeen proposed as a locus of the state estimate [16,17,50] and\nhas been recently implicated in the sense of agency and the\nmental representation of [51,52]; agency is also dependent on\nforward modelling [53]. Our data argue against the possibility\nthat the state estimations are generated exclusively by the\nparietal cortex, because of the disruption caused by cer-\nebellar TMS, but it seems plausible that both areas are\ninvolved. One possibility is that the parietal cortex maintains\na body representation or body schema [50,54] that is updated\nduring movements [16]. We would argue that this update is\ncalculated by the cerebellum.\nAnatomical connections to the cerebellum are consistent\nwith this, as it receives powerful projections from posterior\nPLoS Biology | www.plosbiology.org November 2007 | Volume 5 | Issue 11 | e3162740\nState Estimation in the Cerebellum\nparietal cortex [55], which may hold a representation of the\ncurrent state estimate [16], as well as from cortical motor\nareas, sending an efferent copy of descending commands [56].\nIt also receives visual and proprioceptive afferents, although\nin our task, visual feedback was blocked during the action.\nThe output of the cerebellar processing, which we propose\nconstitutes an estimation of the change in the motor state\ncaused by the efferent signals, may then return to posterior\nparietal cortex [57\u201360] to update its representation, or be\ndirected to motor areas to contribute to the control of the\nactions [56]. In this framework, one might expect that TMS of\nposterior parietal cortex would also disrupt reach-to-target\nactions in this task. Targeting the superior parietal cortex\nusing the P3 electroencephalogram electrode coordinates did\nnot cause signi\ufb01cant effects. However, this negative result\nshould be taken with caution, because we may have missed a\ncritical locus within the posterior parietal cortex (PPC)\nresponsible for maintaining the state representation.\nThe PPC also contributes to the representation of target\npositions [61], and hence it is important to distinguish loss-of-\nstate estimation from errors in localizing the remembered\ntarget. This might be a result of TMS-perturbed input to the\nPPC, or it may be possibly due to a cerebellar role in target\nlocalization. However, we saw no evidence for mislocalization\nof the target in any of our conditions. In particular, we found\ndirection-speci\ufb01c changes in initial movement direction with\ncerebellar TMS that were uncorrelated with changes in end\nposition of the reach-to-target movement. Moreover, these\neffects were signi\ufb01cantly different from the errors caused by\ncerebellar TMS when the hand was initially stationary,\nalthough one might expect any effect of target mislocaliza-\ntion to be common across all these three conditions. There is\nlimited published evidence of a role for the cerebellum in\nlocalization of a visual target [62], and several opposing\nresults [63\u201365]. Thus, it seems unlikely that the changes in\ndirection were a sign of movements planned towards a\nperturbed position,\nHowever, comparing the TMS data from the stationary\nstart condition to the two active movement conditions does\nraise another concern, because it is well known that the TMS\nthresholds in motor cortex are lower during active movement\nthan during rest. We did not test thresholds for activation\nover the cerebellum; however, we note that the arm was not at\nrest in this static position but was actively held in the air just\nabove the start key; this is a motor task in which the\ncerebellum is actively engaged [66\u201368]. Others have used\nsingle-shock stimulation levels of 55% with the same double-\ncone coil and have seen brief changes in excitability of the\ncontralateral motor cortex that are consistent with activation\nof the cerebellar cortex [69]; we have seen the same effects on\nmuscle-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude (unpublished\nresults) using triplets of 20-Hz pulses as used in the present\nexperiments, even at stimulation levels of as low as 35% and\nwith the arm genuinely at rest. So although it is possible that\nour TMS protocol was less effective during the stationary\ncondition, we do not think this likely to have in\ufb02uenced these\nresults.\nControl Experiments and Other Considerations\nThe TMS pulse train is expected to lead to a temporary\ndisruption of the neural processing in underlying target\ntissue. We targeted the hand area of the ipsilateral cerebellar\ncortex at a site at which we have previously caused disruption\nof visually guided action [70], and at which TMS is known to\naffect cerebellar\u2013cerebral projections leading to measurable\nchanges in motor cortical excitation in the contralateral hand\narea [69]. One important control condition was therefore to\ntest the same TMS protocol applied directly to the contrala-\nteral motor cortex, to rule out indirect effects of the\ncerebellar stimulation at this remote site. Motor cortical\nTMS did raise terminal errors lead to some directional\ndeviation of the reaching movement, but both of these effects\nwere of a signi\ufb01cantly smaller magnitude than those seen\nafter cerebellar stimulation (Figures 2 and 3).\nAt the same time, the cerebellar TMS stimulation caused a\nnoticeable change in movement kinematics, with a signi\ufb01cant\nreduction in movement onset latency and an increase in peak\nvelocity. Similar but weaker effects were also generated by\nstimulation over the neck, at a site 3 cm below the cerebellar\nstimulation site. We reproduced the cerebellar effect on\nreaction times using a startling stimulus that did not involve\nfunctional TMS, either by using one wing of the double-cone\ncoil placed over the participants\u2019 right ear to induce the noise\nand possible auditory nerve stimulation caused by the TMS\nstimulation over the cerebellum or neck, or by playing loud\nwhite noise bursts through headphones without any active\nTMS. Thus TMS aimed at the lateral cerebellum can startle\nthe participant and lead to changes in the velocity pro\ufb01le of\nthe movement, regardless of its effect on the cerebellum.\nHowever, even though these control conditions could induce\na similar magnitude shift in reaction time and increase in\npeak velocity, they induced neither the terminal errors nor\nthe initial directional errors that were caused by cerebellar\nTMS. This con\ufb01rms that the initial directional deviation and\nthe \ufb01nal positional errors were not a result of the startle\neffect. Furthermore, we also tested cerebellar stimulation\nfrom a static starting position, a condition that minimizes the\nneed for a dynamic update of the state estimation. Again, we\nsaw change in movement onset and velocity attributable to\nstartle, but we saw no directional deviation or terminal error.\nIt is also possible that TMS applied over the lateral\ncerebellum could cause movement errors due to direct\nstimulation of muscles in the neck, which might lead to\nshoulder or upper arm deviation or cause arm movement by\nstimulation of the brachial plexus [69]. We discounted both\npossibilities by testing TMS stimulation over the neck at a site\nmore likely to activate the brachial plexus, and that\nstimulation generated visible twitches in the neck muscles\nbut without inducing the directional or terminal errors. TMS\nat the level used (45% of machine output) is unlikely to cause\ncortico-spinal stimulation [69,71]. Another control involved\nmeasuring the total deviation of the hand that was held static\nover the start position, without any active reaching task,\nduring TMS of the cerebellum. This would expose any\ninvoluntary hand motion induced either by the TMS,\nincluding activation of the cortico-spinal collaterals [71], or\nby its startling effect. On TMS trials (three participants), the\nindex \ufb01nger was brie\ufb02y deviated laterally by less than 5 mm,\nand within 200 ms had returned to within 1 mm of its initial\nposition, within the normal reaction time period (266 ms).\nHence our results are unlikely to be due to TMS-induced\nperipheral effects.\nA \ufb01nal methodological consideration is that the signi\ufb01-\ncantly reduced reaction times seen after cerebellar TMS\nPLoS Biology | www.plosbiology.org November 2007 | Volume 5 | Issue 11 | e3162741\nState Estimation in the Cerebellum\nmean that the reach-to-target starts from a position near to\nthe mean hand position at which the angular difference\nbetween TMS and non-TMS trials is equal (Figure 3A). In\nother words, one could argue that the TMS has merely shifted\nthe mean start position leftwards in accordance with the\nreduction in reaction time, and has not affected the internal\nstate estimate of the hand. However, the interval of 138 ms\nestimated from comparing directional errors on TMS versus\nnon-TMS trials is signi\ufb01cantly greater than the change in\nreaction time (93 ms). Furthermore, reduction in reaction\ntime alone should not necessarily cause a directional error. If\nthe reach-to-target movements on TMS trials were planned\nusing an accurate state estimate, then their initial direction\nshould be towards the target, despite their reduced latency.\nThis result was clearly seen for the startle trials (Figure 3B), in\nwhich the reaction times were advanced by 85 ms, but the\ninitial direction was unchanged. Thus the startling stimulus\ndoes not affect the movement direction, whereas cerebellar\nTMS does, and this dissociates the effects of reduction in\nreaction time from the loss of state estimation of the hand.\nIn conclusion, we suggest that these results indicate that the\nlateral cerebellum is responsible for estimating the true state\nof the peripheral motor system over a short time interval. We\nassume this estimation is based on forward modelling of the\nexpected consequences of outgoing motor commands and\nthat the updated estimation is sent from the cerebellum to\ncerebral areas responsible for planning and controlling the\nreaching action. These experiments do not tell us how the\ncerebellum generates these signals, whether the TMS protocol\nhas any in\ufb02uence on cerebellar learning, or whether state\nestimates are topographically organized in the cerebellar\ncortex or nuclei. Experiments using methods with \ufb01ner\nspatial resolution than TMS will be needed to address these\nimportant questions.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants. Forty-\ufb01ve right-handed participants (age range 22\u201348\ny, 13 male) received TMS, after providing informed written consent,\nand with approval from the Central Of\ufb01ce for Research Ethics\nCommittees. Two of these were authors of this article: RCM and\nLODC. Seven participants (age range 22\u201350, 6 male) were tested with\nauditory stimulation, including the authors RCM and JS.\nTasks. Participants sat at a table with their head supported by a\nchin rest and wearing Plato LCD goggles (Translucent Tech). A TMS\ncoil was held in position using a Magic-Arm (Adaptivation). The\nposition of the right index \ufb01nger was recorded using a Polhemus\nFastrak at 120 Hz. Trials were timed by a computer running under\nDOS. Each trial began with the index \ufb01nger depressing a start key on\nthe table top in front of the right shoulder. Cued by a set of three\nrising tones at 500-ms intervals, the participant was required to\nrelease the start key on the third tone, and to begin to move the right\nhand towards the right side. The Plato goggles were switched to\nopaque as soon as the start key was released. Early or late release of\nthe key led to the trial being aborted. At a uniform random time 500\u2013\n1,500 ms after the key was released, the onset of a fourth continuous\ntone cued the participant to make a rapid forwards and upwards\nreach to place the index \ufb01nger on the position of a virtual target\nimage, re\ufb02ecting a 1-cm target in a mirror. The target was\napproximately 28 cm above and 15 cm in front of the start key.\nOne second after this \ufb01nal go cue, the Plato goggles were switched to\ntransparent, allowing terminal vision of the static \ufb01nger and virtual\ntarget. The subject then returned to the start key at their own pace.\nOn each session, participants were given 60 practice trials, on a\nrandom 50% of which a series of three TMS clicks were heard, at 50,\n100, and 150 ms after the onset of the go cue. During training, the coil\nwas held about 1 m from the head; training data were only recorded\nfor 18 participants. Immediately after the practise, the TMS coil was\npositioned against the scalp, and another 60 trials collected, with\nactive TMS on half the trials.\nNine participants were also tested in a condition is which the start\nkey was moved 20 cm laterally, to the average position at which the\nreach to the target started (Figure 1B). Subjects were instructed to lift\nthe index \ufb01nger off the start key but to remain stationary until the go\ncue signalled the rapid reach to the target. All other aspects of the\ntask remained the same.\nTMS. Repetitive stimulation was delivered as three biphasic pulses\ntriggered at 20 Hz (50 ms) by the experimental control computer, at\n45% of machine output, using a Magstim Rapid (Magstim Co.). For\nstimulation of the lateral cerebellum (n\u00bc32), a 90-mm radius double-\ncone coil was centred 3 cm lateral and 1 cm below the inion [69,70]. In\nthis position, one wing of the coil normally overlaps the participant\u2019s\nright ear. Ear plugs were provided.\nTo test the effects of TMS noise and its possible stimulation of the\nright ear, the orientation of the double cone coil was reversed in four\nparticipants so that one coil surrounded the right ear while the other\nwas approximately normal to the scalp. Biphasic stimulation was set\nat 45% of the machine output. These data were combined with that\nof a group of seven participants in which the TMS trigger pulses were\nused to trigger brief white noise bursts (100 dB, 20-ms duration),\nplayed through binaural headphones. This white noise was suf\ufb01-\nciently loud to evoke observable re\ufb02exive blinks in all participants,\nwhile remaining within safety limits. Comparison of the data from the\ntwo groups (ear TMS versus auditory stimulation) revealed no\nsigni\ufb01cant differences, and the two datasets were combined.\nFor stimulation of the neck (n\u00bc 11) a \ufb02at, 70-mm radius \ufb01gure-of-\neight coil was used, with the coil centre 3 cm below the site used for\ncerebellar stimulation (3 cm lateral and 4 cm below the inion).\nStimulator output was set at 45% of machine output.\nFor stimulation of the motor cortex (n\u00bc 20) the \ufb02at, 70-mm radius\n\ufb01gure-of-eight coil was positioned at a site where an observable\ntwitch of the right \ufb01rst dorsal interoseus muscle was seen. Stimulator\noutput was set at the resting threshold. For posterior parietal cortex,\nall participants (n\u00bc 12) were also tested with M1 stimulation and the\nsame stimulator intensity was used. The P3 electrode position was\nmeasured using standard landmarks.\nData analysis. Index \ufb01nger trajectories were analysed in Matlab\nversion R2007a. A Polhemus Fastrak receiver was taped above the\nright index \ufb01nger, and before the experiment began, each participant\nheld the index \ufb01nger stationary in the position of the virtual target,\nunder full vision. The recorded marker position was then taken as the\ntarget position in all subsequent analysis, accounting for the 1\u20131.5 cm\npositional offset of the marker from the index \ufb01nger pad. Finger\nposition was recorded in three axes at 120 Hz; angular rotations of\nthe hand that would invalidate this positional offset were minimal\nand estimated at less than 1 mm; the relative difference between TMS\nand non-TMS trials is less than 10% of this (0.1 mm).\nTMS artefacts. TMS magnetic pulses can generate a signi\ufb01cant\none-sample (8 ms) artefact in the Polhemus motion tracking data,\nwhich uses magnetic \ufb01eld technology. These artefacts were detected\nin the \ufb01rst-differenced time series data and removed by interpolation\nacross neighbouring data points.\nTo assess the impact of these artefacts, we recorded the apparent\nmarker position of a static marker placed at the average start position\nof the reach-to-target movement, with the TMS coil placed in\napproximate similar position as when testing a participant. Artefact\nremoval was successful and the apparent residual motion of the\nmarker was under 0.1 cm or 1 cm\/s. The duration of the artefact was\nalso restricted mainly to within the typical reaction time, so any\nresidual error did not affect analysis of the reach trajectory. Testing\nwith the marker attached to a participant\u2019s \ufb01nger held stationary\nwhile TMS was applied to the cerebellum (three participants, 20 trials\neach) showed that stimulation of the cerebellum caused minor \ufb01nger\nmotion that was recovered within 200 ms of TMS termination.\nThe cleaned positional data were then low-pass \ufb01ltered (8th order\nzero phase 7.5 Hz Butterworth \ufb01lter). Low-pass \ufb01ltered index \ufb01nger\ntrajectories were differentiated to velocity, and the tangential speed\nwas averaged across all TMS (n\u00bc 30) and non-TMS trials (n\u00bc 30) per\nsubject for each condition. The subject mean velocities were then\naveraged across the subject group.\nMean speed and jerk (second derivative of speed) pro\ufb01les were\nexamined before and after the removal of the TMS-artefacts in the\nPolhemus data to con\ufb01rm that the artefact removal was effective. All\ntrials (TMS and non-TMS) were processed and \ufb01ltered identically.\nDetection of terminal and directional error. The following steps\nwere taken for analysis of each trial. First, the time-point of\nmaximum velocity was detected between the go cue and the end of\nrecording (open circles, Figure 1B and 1C). Termination of the reach-\nPLoS Biology | www.plosbiology.org November 2007 | Volume 5 | Issue 11 | e3162742\nState Estimation in the Cerebellum\nto-target was then taken as the time point at which movement\nvelocity fell below 5% of the maximum (\ufb01lled circles and trial\nnumber, Figure 1B and 1C).\nReach-to-target movement onset was detected as the point of\nmaximum curvature between the go cue and the point of maximum\nvelocity (asterisks, Figure 1B and 1C). To \ufb01nd this, each trajectory\nfrom go cue to termination was spatially re-sampled to 100 uniformly\nspaced points, the rate of change of these spatial positions then\nrecorded as curvature, and the maximum curvature spatial position\nfound. The time point of original data sample the within the original\ntime series closest to this spatial position was then recorded as the\ntime point at which the reach movement initiated.\nEnd point error was measured as the Cartesian distance of the\n\ufb01nger from the target. Directional errors were measured as the\nazimuth or elevation differenced between lines joining the start point\nand target, versus the start point and maximum velocity point for\neach trial. Mean angular differences in azimuth and elevation\nbetween all TMS (n \u00bc 30) and all non-TMS trials (n \u00bc 30) were\ncalculated per subject for each experimental session.\nEstimation of predictive interval. To estimate the positional offset\nthat corresponded to the directional error measured, the angle\nbetween the start position and the position of maximum velocity was\ncalculated for the mean trajectory of all non-TMS trials (n \u00bc 30) for\neach subject in each condition. Trajectories were spatially re-sampled\nbefore averaging (e.g., Figure 1D and 1E). Then, by iteratively\nrecalculating this angle for each data position before the start\nposition, we found the \ufb01rst position at which the angular difference\nexceeded the mean angular difference between TMS and non-TMS\ntrials (black dots, Figure 3). The distance along the mean trajectory\nbetween this position and the start position was found. To estimate\nthe time interval that corresponded to this spatial offset, the mean\nvelocity of the hand was found at cue onset, for each subject. Dividing\nthe estimated offset, subject-by-subject by the mean velocity, we\nestimated the time interval of the state estimation.\nTo test the sensitivity of this analysis to the arbitrary choice of the\npoint of maximum velocity as a reference position, we repeated the\nabove analysis choosing instead \ufb01ve time points in 50-ms steps from\n50\u2013250 ms after the start of the reach-to-target movement; the\nmaximum velocity was normally reached at about 250 ms (Figure 6).\nThe \ufb01rst 50 ms estimate was signi\ufb01cantly different from all others\n(Figure 7, Bonferroni adjusted p , 0.001, paired t-tests); the other\nfour estimates did not signi\ufb01cantly differ (Bonferroni adjusted p .\n0.3), and did not differ from the estimate based on the maximal\nvelocity (dashed lines, Figure 7). Hence, we are satis\ufb01ed that the\nresults we present here are largely insensitive to the precise reference\npoint chosen within the reach-to-target trajectory at which we assess\nmovement direction, and may somewhat underestimate the magni-\ntude of the time interval. Only when this reference position is close to\nthe initiation point of the movement (50 ms, or 6 data sample) was\nthe estimate lower than that calculate from the point of maximum\nvelocity. Figure 7 also makes clear that the highest estimate of the\ninterval (161 6 11.9 ms) was found using a reference point 150 ms\ninto the movement, and this may then indicate that this (150\u2013160 ms)\nis indeed the best estimate; additional experimental work will be\nrequired to get independence evidence of this, however.\nAcknowledgments\nAuthor contributions.
