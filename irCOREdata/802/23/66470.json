L. Roberts et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 81, 5109 (1998)]. In\naddition to a better determination of the position of the resonance peak (154.9(4) gauss) and its\nwidth (11.0(4) gauss), improvements in our techniques now allow the measurement of the absolute\nsize of the elastic scattering rate. This provides a new measure of the s-wave scattering length\nas a function of magnetic field near the Feshbach resonance and constrains the Rb-Rb interaction\npotential.\nPACS Number(s): 34.50.-s, 03.75.Fi, 05.30.Jp, 32.80.Pj\nThe presence of a Feshbach resonance in cold atomic collisions allows the elastic and inelastic collision properties\nto be dramatically altered as an external field is changed [1]. In particular, the s-wave scattering length (a), which\ncompletely characterizes elastic scattering in ultracold collisions, can be tuned over a large range. In 1998, several\ngroups reported the observation of external-magnetic-field Feshbach resonances in ultracold collisions in 85Rb [2,3]\nand in 23Na [4]. These tunable interactions have been used to study the stability [5] and dynamics [6] of 85Rb BECs\nwith attractive interactions. Interpreting the results of these recent studies and other future studies in 85Rb requires\na more accurate knowledge of a as a function of magnetic field (B) near the Feshbach resonance than that obtained\nin Ref. [2]. In order to improve the accuracy of the determination of a versus B, we extended and improved the\nmeasurements performed in Ref. [2].\nThe cold collision Rb-Rb interatomic potential and hence the s-wave scattering length vs. magnetic field is char-\nacterized primarily by three parameters: the triplet scattering length, aT ; the singlet scattering length, aS ; and the\nC6 van der Waals coefficient [7,8]. In our previous work, we measured two characteristics of the prominent Feshbach\nresonance in 85Rb: the magnetic field at which the magnitude of the s-wave scattering length was maximum (Bpeak)\nand the magnetic field at which the s-wave scattering length was zero (Bzero). This was done by measuring the\nrelative elastic scattering cross section as the magnetic field was changed. This tightly constrained two of the three\nparameters, aT and aS , for a given C6. However, C6 was much less constrained, even when combined with the results\nfrom another experiment [9]. At the time, the temperature of the trapped atom clouds was too hot to allow the\ndetermination of the absolute value of the scattering length [2].\nWe have now been able to improve the measurements made in Ref. [2] in two ways. First, the measurement of the\nstability of BECs with attractive atom-atom interactions (negative a) has allowed a much more precise measurement\nof Bzero. This more precise determination showed the presence of some small errors in the previous measurement.\nSecond, we now have a far greater range of density and temperature of the magnetically trapped atom clouds available,\nand much better control over those quantities. The reproducibility and calibration were also improved. The absolute\nvalue of the scattering length could now be accurately determined. This additional constraint allows us to completely\ncharacterize a vs. B near the Feshbach resonance.\nThe more precise measurement of the position of Bzero was a natural outgrowth of our work determining the\nstability of magnetically trapped BECs with attractive atom-atom interactions [5]. When large enough attractive\ninteractions (defined by Na) are present, the BECs will become unstable and collapse. The collapse criterion is given\nby the relation Ncr|a| = \u03b2, where Ncr is the number of atoms in the condensate and \u03b2 = 1.41\u00b5m for our magnetic\ntrap. In Ref. [5], Ncr was determined as a function of magnetic field down to very small a. A simple extrapolation to\nthe point where Ncr = \u221e determined the position of Bzero. The value of Bzero determined in this way is 165.85(5)\ngauss (G), a factor of six more precise than before. This increase in precision occurs both because the stability\nmeasurement is more sensitive and it avoids temperature-dependent shifts.\nThe new determination of Bzero disagrees with the previous measurement [2] Bzero=166.8(3)G by more than the\nstated errors. A small error in the magnetic field calibration in Ref. [2] is reponsible for 0.3G of the difference.\nThe remainder of the difference is likely due to temperature shifts of the elastic cross section and the temperature-\ndependent asymmetry in the cross section versus magnetic field near Bzero [10] that were not adequately included in\nRef. [2]. The new magnetic field calibration also shifts the measured position of Bpeak to 154.9(4)G.\n1\nThe absolute value of the scattering length was determined at several values of the magnetic field, using \u201ccross-\ndimensional mixing\u201d measurements as in Ref. [2]. In this technique, a cloud of cold atoms, created by evaporative\ncooling as in Ref. [11], is perturbed from its equilibrium energy distribution. The time for the cloud to equilibrate by\nelastic collisions is then measured. In the zero-temperature limit, the elastic collision cross section (\u03c3) is \u03c3 = 8pia2.\nOnce the atom cloud had been cooled sufficiently, the bias magnetic field in the trap was ramped to near Bzero to\ndrastically reduce the elastic collision rate. By cutting faster with the rf-\u201cknife\u201d used for evaporative cooling than the\ncloud could equilibrate, it was possible to remove energy in just the radial direction of the axially symmetric magnetic\ntrap [2]. The width of the cloud in the radial direction was decreased until the radial energy had been reduced to\n0.6 of the axial direction, and then the bias magnetic field was ramped adiabatically to a selected value and the\ncloud was allowed to equilibrate for a fixed time. The size, number, and shape of the cloud were measured using\non-resonance destructive absorption imaging. This procedure was repeated for different equilibration times and the\nrate of the relaxation of the aspect ratio of the clouds (the ratio of the axial width to the radial width) to equilibrium\nwas recorded.\nThe rate of flow of energy out of any particular direction, axial or radial, is proportional to the difference between\nthe average energy in that direction and the equilibrium value multiplied by the factor \u0393 = 2\n\u03ba\n\u3008n\u3009\u03c3\u3008v\u3009 (i.e. dEi\ndt\n=\n\u2212\u0393(Ei\u2212Eavg), i=x,y,z). In the factor \u0393, \u3008n\u3009 is the average density defined by\n\u222b\nn(~x)2d3x\u222b\nn(~x)d3x\n, \u3008v\u3009 is the root-mean-square\nrelative speed\n\u221a\n16kBT\n\u03c0m\n, \u03c3 = 8pia2 is the elastic collision cross section, and \u03ba is a numerical factor. The parameter \u03ba\nis weakly dependent on the difference between radial and axial energy but is always within 2% of the value 2.50. It is\ncalculated using classical transport theory [12] with the assumption that the velocity and density distributions can be\ndescribed in each direction by a single parameter, an effective temperature that is equal to the average energy divided\nby the Boltzmann constant kB . A Monte-Carlo simulation agrees with this classical calculation at the 4% level [13].\nThe relaxation of the aspect ratio was fit appropriately to determine \u0393 and hence a. \u0393 is not strictly constant as a\nfunction of equilibration time since the density and temperature of an atom cloud varied during equilibration due to\nloss, heating, and change in shape. These small (< 5%) variations were included in the fits to the data. The density\nand temperature of the atom cloud was measured directly along with the aspect ratio in the absorption imaging. The\ndensity was maintained near 2.5 \u00d7 1010cm\u22123 and the temperature was kept near 130 nK. For these cold clouds, the\nenergy dependence of the average elastic cross section is expected to be less than 5%, and the fits to the data included\nthe energy dependence due to the unitarity limit [14].\nData were taken at B=168.0, 169.7, and 251.0 G. The magnetic field was calibrated in the same way as Ref. [2]:\nthe rf frequency that resonantly drove spin flip transitions for atoms at the center of the cloud was measured and the\nBreit-Rabi equation was used to determine the magnetic field. Colder clouds were used, improving the precision. The\nspread of the magnetic field across the clouds was \u223c 0.2G FWHM. Figure 1 shows a set of aspect ratio equilibration\ndata and the corresponding fit. Across the range of magnetic fields measured, the equilibration times varied by about\na factor of 30. The distance from Bpeak ensures that the spread in a due to the spread in B across the cloud was not\nsignificant and that the precise location of Bpeak is also not a limiting factor in analyzing the results.\nThe uncertainty in the determination of a is dominated by the determination of number and the fit to obtain \u0393.\nThe number determination relies on the calibration of our absorption imaging system, which was performed while\ntaking into account the frequency and intensity of our probe laser, optical pumping effects, and the small Doppler shift\narising from scattering multiple photons. We estimate the uncertainty to be 10%, which results in a 5% uncertainty\nin each determination of a. The uncertainty in the fit to obtain \u0393 is primarily caused by small oscillations in the\naspect ratio due to the vertical and horizontal radial directions not being perfectly degenerate. Although this limited\nthe accuracy of the fit, the size of this imbalance was varied and no significant shifts in the results were observed.\nAlso, the period of the oscillations does not depend on the value of a and so the agreement between data sets of very\ndifferent equilibration times also indicates that this effect is not distorting the results significantly. The measured\nvalue (in atomic units) of a is -342(10), -97(6), and -60(4) at B = 251.0, 169.7, and 168.0G, respectively. The listed\nuncertainty does not include the common uncertainty due to the atom number determination.\nNear the Feshbach resonance, the change in a with B can be well approximated by the relation a = abg(1 \u2212\nBzero\u2212Bpeak\nB\u2212Bpeak\n) [15]. Using this, we can determine abg for each measured value of a (Fig. 2). The weighted average of\nall of these data gives abg = \u2212380(21) where the uncertainty is dominated by the determination of number.\nOur measurement now constrains all three parameters needed to describe the Rb-Rb potential for ultracold colli-\nsions. Using the same methods presented in Ref. [2], the Rb-Rb Born-Oppenheimer potentials are adjusted until the\ntheoretically predicted Bzero, Bpeak, and abg match the observed values. The calculation of a vs. B is performed using\na quantum defect method [16]. Matching the Rb-Rb potential to the observed scattering lengths implies aT (\n85Rb)\n= \u2212332\u00b1 18, aS(\n85Rb)=3650+1500\n\u2212670 [17], and C6 = 4660\u00b1 20, where all of the values are listed in atomic units [18].\nThis value of the C6 coefficient is consistent both with an ab initio calculation [19] and a recent photoassociation\n2\nmeasurement [20].\nAs a result of improvements in our experimental techniques and the measurement of 85Rb BEC stability in the\npresence of attractive interactions, we have been able to improve our characterization of the prominent Feshbach\nresonance in 85Rb.\nThis work has been supported by the ONR and NSF.

Relaxation of the aspect ratio to equilibrium. The data shown here were taken at B=169.7G. Each data point (\u2022)\nrepresents a single destructive absorption measurement. The solid line shows the fit to the data used to determine the elastic\nscattering cross section and hence the scattering length. The deviation of the data points from the fit around 3-4 seconds is\ndue to the oscillations between the two radial directions as described in the main text.\nFIG. 2. The value of abg implied by several cross-dimensional mixing measurements. This value was determined by dividing\nthe s-wave scattering length determined at a particular magnetic field by the factor (1\u2212\nBzero\u2212Bpeak\nB\u2212Bpeak\n). The s-wave scattering\nlengths measured at 251.0G were divided by an additional factor of 0.99 to account for the deviation of the approximate\ndescription of a vs. B from the full theory calculation. The error bars shown include the statistical errors plus the fit\nuncertainty due the initial radial energy imbalance. The fit uncertainty is non-statistical and so the central values are clustered\ntogether more than the error bars would suggest.\n3\nEquilibration Time (sec)\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60\nAs\npe\nct\n R\nat\nio\n2.3\n2.5\n2.7\n2.9\n3.1\nMagnetic Field (Gauss)\n167 168 169 170 250 252\na\nbg\n \n(at\no\nm\nic\n u\nn\nits\n)\n-450\n-420\n-390\n-360\n-330\n-300\n"}
