Email: shertog@gmx.de \n \n \n There are two established ways of recounting the emergence of the modern Gulf oil \nmonarchies: One type, the social scientific one, tends to tell the reader of anonymous \nstructural forces, of the \u201cresource curse\u201d, of the \u201crentier state\u201d, and of how these forces have \nshaped politics and markets with their inexorable logic. The other narrative, of the popular \nhistory variety, offers us romantic, personalized accounts of desert shaykhs, their whims, and \nthe sudden riches of their families (complemented by tales of monumental corruption in some \nless benevolent tales).  \n \nIn its analysis of the creation of the Saudi Arabian administration, this article will, to a \nsurprising degree perhaps, side with the shaykhs. This is despite \u2013 or rather because of \u2013 its \nambition of being theoretically informed: By stressing the role of elite decisions in the process \nof state creation in Saudi Arabia, it will try to bring personality and politics back into the \nstructurally over-determined accounts of the creation of Gulf states and rentier systems in \ngeneral.1  \n \nThe article will look specifically at the formative period of state formation between 1951 \nand 1962, when the interplay of administrative growth and elite politics, patronage and \nfactionalism was the most intense and the institutional setting the most fluid. The account has \nthree main explanatory aims: First, to explain how early conflicts and deals between senior \npolitical figures \u201ccongealed\u201d into institutional constellations which have shaped the \nkingdom\u2019s political landscape until today. Rapidly growing oil income temporarily gave the \nSaudi political elite great autonomy in designing the shape of their expanding state, and \ninstitutions were unusually flexible tokens in power games.  \n \nSecondly, the article intends to explain how the Saudi administration developed a certain \ndegree of segmentation early on, i.e. the tendency of various institutions to be little \u201cstates \nwithin the state\u201d \u2013 a feature closely related to the early personalization of institutional design. \nThis segmentation has allowed the emergence of a few very efficient bureaucratic islands, but \nhas also led to failures of coordination and the parallel building of neo-patrimonial \nbureaucratic fiefdoms, a feature still much in evidence in today\u2019s kingdom. Increasing \nbureaucratization and regularization has often only solidified these cleavages. \n \nThirdly, the article explains how the extreme social mobility offered by a rapidly \nexpanding state and its social networks created new players in the economic and political \nelite. This fluidity is in marked contrast to today\u2019s mature and very static Saudi system in \nwhich most stakes have been \u201cparcelled out\u201d, both in business and bureaucracy. Much of the \nSaudi elite and its institutions were made in a dozen dizzying years in the 1950s and 1960s.  \n \nIn theoretical terms, the aim of the article is to nuance several of the assumptions of the \ndebate on \u201crentier states\u201d by closely looking at the actual history of bureaucratic evolution of \nSaudi Arabia, the literature\u2019s staple rentier example. I intend to show that the autonomy of \nrentier states is not constant over time, as constraints grow with bureaucratic expansion. I also \ndemonstrate that external state income does not necessarily lead to inefficient institutions, but \nrather opens great leeway for institutional design which can be highly efficient in some areas \nand patrimonial in others.  \n \nThe article is divided into two halves: One describes the early jumble of institutional \ngrowth which went along with growing oil income and the expansion of Al Saud princes into \nthe state after 1951. The second half recounts how a more permanent distribution of power \nand institutional resources emerged from the fundamental struggle between King Saud and \nCrown Prince Faisal. A briefer section explains how the dispensation which had emerged by \n1962 subsequently grew and was consolidated, with the Saudi state apparatus moving from \ngreat fluidity to bureaucratization and eventually great stasis \u2013 immortalizing the institutional \noutcomes of earlier struggles. \n \nMy account is almost exclusively based on primary sources, significant parts of which are \npreviously unexploited. I have used archives on three continents, including US and British \ndiplomatic documents up to 1975, the extensive records of a 1960s\/70s Ford Foundation \nmission on administrative reform held at the Institute of Public Administration in Riyadh, the \nMulligan Papers at Georgetown University, and the Philby archive at St. Antony\u2019s College in \nOxford. I have moreover conducted interviews with seasoned diplomats, expatriate advisors \nand former Saudi bureaucrats in London and Riyadh. Finally, I draw on a large number of \nPhDs written by Saudis in the West about Saudi administrative development issues, a number \nof contemporary country studies and reports in 1950s and 1960s trade journals.  \n \nThe literature \nWhile much has been written on the impact of the USA on the formation of modern Saudi \nArabia,2 little research has been done on the internal politics of the formation of the modern \nSaudi state. \n \nSarah Yizraeli\u2019s valuable \u201cThe remaking of Saudi Arabia\u201d3 remains the only account \nprimarily concerned with Saudi elite politics in the 1950s and early 60s, which I hope to \ncomplement from a more institutional perspective: Yizraeli concentrates mainly on the \nstruggle between Faisal, Saud and their princely followers and is less concerned with the \nformation and composition of bureaucracy as such. The fiefdom character and segmentation \nof administration and its interplay with personal politics on various levels therefore are not in \nthe focus of her analysis, which results in a certain overemphasis on the \u201cmodern\u201d aspects of \ninstitutional growth and differentiation under Faisal. \n \nWhile Yizraeli focuses strongly on persons, the other main account of modern state \nformation in Saudi Arabia, Kiren Aziz Chaudhry\u2019s \u201cThe Price of Wealth\u201d, conversely talks \nalmost exclusively about structural economic forces and institutions. Individual actors are \nlargely absent from her account, which means that many specifics of institution-building I \nfocus on go unexplained, and rationality and capacity of the early Saudi administration are \nconsiderably exaggerated.4 My claim is that focusing on the interplay of personal politics and \ninstitutional formation offers the most adequate perspective on the formative years of the \nmodern Saudi state. \n \nIn addition to contributing to the still very thin historiography of Saudi state-building, my \nambition is to challenge and contextualize several of the broader theoretical claims of rentier \nstate theories, for which Saudi Arabia has often been used as archetypical case. There is no \nfully formulated, generally accepted rentier state theory. There are however a number of \nrecurring hypotheses connected to effects of oil income on politics.  \n \nFirst, rentier theorists usually argue that oil income grants state elites increased autonomy \nfrom social forces.5 Kiren Chaudhry was right to challenge this generalization in her account \nof the economic crisis in the 1980s,6 in which entrenched distributional coalitions managed to \nstall the regime\u2019s austerity policies. I argue, however, that regime autonomy was considerably \nhigher at an early state of state-building, before distributional networks and entitlements were \nestablished on a large scale. In other words, state autonomy of rentier states seems to decline \nover time. This highlights the importance of early institutional decisions, which can create \nstrong path-dependencies which are not accounted for in \u201cstatic\u201d rentier theories. \n Secondly, my ambition is to disaggregate the state, which is usually dealt with in the \naggregate by rentier theorists7 (and, implicitly, by Kiren Chaudhry too, as she sees all state \ninstitutions subject to the same, although shifting, development dynamics over time). By \nbreaking up the state on a meso-level, I show that different parts of it have followed different \ntrajectories, some developmental, some regressive \u2013 largely depending on how early elite \ndecisions shaped institutions. There is no automatic mechanism producing regulatory failure \nand rent-seeking in rentier states.8  \n \nMy account offers a way to look at the crucial role of oil in state-building without succumbing \nto rentier state determinism. As Jill Crystal has shown on the cases of Kuwait and Qatar, \ncrucial junctures of regime formation shape later political options.9 What she does for state-\nbusiness relations, I do for politics within the state. Michael Herb has drawn our attention to \nthe dynamics of \u201cdynastic rule\u201d to explain elite politics and regime survival in the Gulf.10 I \nanalyze the impact of dynastic rule on state formation. \n \nThe state of the state in the early to mid 1950s \n \n\u201cVerily, my children and my possessions are my enemies\u201d (Ibn Saud briefly before his \ndeath)11  \n \nPatrimonial rule under Abdalaziz  \nModern bureaucracy is a recent phenomenon in Saudi Arabia. Its first elements were \ncreated in the early 1950s during King Abdalaziz\u2019 last years, when oil income was taking off. \nIn the lean years before, the kingdom had not been ruled through a differentiated \nadministrative apparatus, but rather through trusted regional governors installed by the king, \nsupported by other local intermediaries and clients, be it notables or tribal shuyukh.  \n \nOn the national level, the system completely revolved around Abdalaziz, who was king, \nchief legislator and had the right to review all judicial decisions.12 Most of the departments at \nAbdalaziz\u2019 court were occupied with the logistics of the court itself and not broader \nadministration or public services.13 In the Western Province, taken from the Hashemites in the \nmid-1920s, Abdalaziz had inherited a somewhat more elaborate bureaucratic structure, with \nspecial offices e.g. for health and education.14  \n \nAltogether, however, most Saudis had no contact with formal administration, as apart from \nbasic security, the state provided hardly any services to its citizens. There were few formal, \nnational bodies during most of Abdalaziz\u2019 reign: A ministry of foreign affairs had been set up \nin 1930 under Faisal. Ministries of Finance and Defense followed in 1937 and 1944. These \nagencies were not linked through formal mechanisms of budgeting or governance.15  \n \nAfter WWII, oil income started to grow rapidly \u2013 from 10.4 million US$ in 1946 to 56.7 \nmillion US$ in 1950.16 While old Abdalaziz\u2019 personal rule grew increasingly slack due to his \nfrailty,17 there was a growing need to manage the huge sums of money flowing into the \nkingdom, as at least his second oldest surviving son Faisal and the American diplomats and \noilmen present at the time realized.18 In the absence of any scheme for budgeting and \ndevelopment, much of the growing oil income was frittered away by the court, its clients and \ntheir entourages.19 There was another reason for institution-building: With the unquestioned \npatriarch leaving the stage, a new generation of princes vied for power and prestige,20 giving \nthem a stake in the creation of new posts and ministries.  \n \nAnalysis: a state created above society   \nThe state would soon start to grow rapidly, providing posts for numerous princely \naspirants. In the following I will indeed argue that the way the state grew was an outcome \nlargely of royal elite decisions unconstrained by larger political forces. To substantiate that, \nsome social history is needed before I engage with princely dealings in detail. \n \nIn the 1950s, the national income was still extremely small by standards of modern \nstatehood. However, the aggregate societal demands on it were even smaller:21 Saudi society, \nbased on an economy which in most regions barely provided for subsistence needs, was \nunprepared for the riches. Most politics was local as people were ruled through the Al Saud\u2019s \ntribal or notable intermediaries. The kingdom knew no public space to negotiate over national \nbudgets, which were fed externally and grew rather suddenly. Saudi Arabia had no national \nconstitution, no formal mechanisms of political participation, and no experience of national \npolitics. Society was deeply geographically fragmented. \n \nThere were no large and coherent social groups to voice demands towards the government. \nMerchants were quickly tied up in patronage structures.22 Their Chambers of Commerce were \nstate-created, state-dependent and had little voice in policy-making.23 Aramco researchers \ndescribed Saudi businessman as \u201cmore individualistic\u201d than their counterparts in other places, \nnot interested in collective bargaining24 \u2013 which is indeed completely absent from the \nhistorical record. \n \nSimilarly, the independent power of tribes had been crushed in the course of Abdalaziz\u2019 \nconquest of the peninsula in the 1920s and 1930s,25 and were subsequently co-opted through \nroyal subsidies, without much modern state infrastructure interfering or being demanded.26 \nThe kingdom had no working class \u2013 with the exception of Aramco workers in the Eastern \nProvince, whose demonstrations were harshly repressed in the 1950s and 1960s.27 \nNewspapers were all closely supervised by the state, their boards usually controlled by princes \nor senior public servants.28  \n \nRobert Vitalis cites a US labor attach\u00e9\u2019s early 1950s conclusion that Aramco \u201ccan ignore \npublic opinion, which is neither a force nor a voice\u201d29. American \u201cNew Dealers\u201d on a \ntechnical cooperation mission looked in vain for grassroots initiatives to support in Saudi \nsociety. Municipal elections in the early 1960s were purely local phenomena in which \ngovernors could clearly control who would get elected and who not,30 and in which the \npopulation at large tended to take limited interest.31 Throughout the 1950s and 1960s there \nwere no parties or other national interest organizations to speak of. The consultative council \nstill extant in the Western Province had no real political role and no popular backing.32 \n \nThe Saudi ulama, finally, were an important part of the ruling elite, but despite popular \nmyths, consistently deferred to royal prerogative, as was indeed their ideology.33 As far as \nthey played a role on policy, this concerned matters of public morals, but not the specifics of \nbureaucracy-building.34 \n \nWith no national political traditions and most Saudis not in touch with the administration, \nsociety hardly constrained the decisions which royal elites took on building their state. A \nunique pattern of bureaucracy-building ensued in which yet embryonic institutions became \ntokens of intra-elite bargaining among ambitious princes, and a limited number of commoners \nclients. There was of course an underlying concern to build institutions which could \nadminister the increasing flow of oil income35 \u2013 but beyond this very general need, personal \nambitions and bargains loomed very large in determining specific outcomes. \n \nIn 1951 Abdalaziz created the basis for a rudimentary functional differentiation of \ndomestic bureaucratic institutions, separating the Ministry of Interior (MoI) from the fiscal \nand administrative affairs of the Ministry of Finance. Differentiation meant spread of the royal \nfamily into state posts: The MoI was given to Faisal\u2019s son Abdallah.36 In December 1953, \nbriefly after Abdalaziz\u2019 death, the Ministries of Education and Agriculture were officially \nestablished as spin-offs from the Ministries of Interior and Finance respectively. Aspiring \nPrince Sultan took charge of agriculture, his full brother Fahd of education.  \n \nThere were few functioning mechanisms to coordinate their work: The formal introduction \nof a Council of Ministers in 1953, briefly before Abdalaziz\u2019 death, had changed little about \nactual practices of governance. New King Saud, Abdalaziz\u2019 oldest surviving son governed \naccording to the patrimonial style of his father, basing his rule on the court and embarking on \ngrand tours through the country in which he disbursed royal largesse.37 Decision-making on \nmajor national questions remained largely informal,38 and although service provision \nimproved in some sectors, governance was marred by \u201cprincely jealousies\u201d.39  \n \nInstitutional design: \u201cform follows family\u201d \nIt was largely intra-family patrimonial politics which determined who would receive \nwhich government post \u2013 not different from other clan-based, administratively \nunderdeveloped political systems. However, patrimonial politics also determined much of the \nvery institutional design of the rapidly growing state during Abdalaziz\u2019 last years and under \nhis first successor.  \n \nInstitutions in the 1950s were malleable and often adjusted to the authority and status of \nthe persons or factions leading them \u2013 or occasionally created from scratch to either bolster or \nweaken specific players. Although there was a general trend of functional differentiation, \nconcerns of power balancing were as important in the emergence of specific bureaucratic \ndesigns: princes had to be accorded roles according to their seniority, while also satisfying \ntheir ambitions as far as possible. In summer 1951, Abdallah bin Faisal was made Minister of \nHealth and Interior for the reported reason that he should be equal in status to Minister of \nDefense Prince Mishcal.40 Conversely, the likely motivation for a 1952 plan to set up a \nMinistry of Air Force, with Mishcal as minister and his full brother Mitcib as deputy, was to \nprevent aviation issues from falling under the authority of the new Ministry of \nCommunications under Prince Talal.41 At some point in 1953, it seemed that Saudi Arabia \nwould have to separate government airlines, as Mishcal and Talal could not agree.42  \n \nWhen Talal resigned as Minister of Communications in 1955, the Communications \nportfolio was reassigned to the Ministry of Finance (then under the commoner Mohammad \nSuroor). Talal told US diplomats that this was essentially a solution to avoid picking one of \nthe various princely candidates for the post and offending the others.43 There was no \nindication that qualification played a great role in creating and apportioning posts: more \ntalented princes operated next to worse ones.44 As far as we know, no prince was ever fired \nfor performance failure in the 1950s or 1960s. Although the historical record does not allow \nus to establish the precise motivations for every specific institutional decision, we can \nconclude that balances of power and personal ambitions within the Al Saud have played a \nuniquely prominent role. \n \nIt seems that the tailoring of institutions around personal needs and conflicts was also \nreproduced on a smaller scale among senior commoner administrators: Then Deputy Minister \nof Finance Mohammad Suroor e.g. was given a new post for the supervision of both \npilgrimage and broadcasting for the reason that the heads of these two departments were \nrivals, and making Suroor titular head of both meant that none would be subordinate to the \nother.45 When Saudi ambassador to the US Asad Al-Faqih returned to the kingdom in 1955, a \nnew senior post in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was created according to his own \nproposal.46 Although skills often did matter for selecting commoner administrators (such as \noil minister Abdallah Tariki or Minister of State Abdallah bin cAdwan), structures of \nclientelism and long-term loyalty also played a prominent role, often to the detriment of \nperformance.47 \n \nUnder King Saud, senior appointments and institutional changes were increasingly a \nfunction of his rivalry with Crown Prince Faisal. Apart from Talal, all new princely \nappointments to his \u201creform\u201d cabinet had no administrative experience to speak ok,48 clearly \nindicating that building a coalition in the family was his main concern. The Saud-Faisal \nstruggle has been recounted in detail elsewhere.49 A few examples of how it affected the \ninstitutional set-up of the kingdom will suffice. The defence establishment was a prime \nbattleground, in terms of successive appointments, but also administrative engineering. King \nSaud detached the Royal Guard under Muscad bin Saud from the Ministry of Defense to \nweaken Mishcal and strengthen his own sons. The Guard temporarily was the most powerful \nmilitary unit.50 In May 1955, Saud decreed the formation of a modern National Guard which \nwas to be headed by another of his sons, Khalid bin Saud. This again was seen as a step \nagainst Mishcal, who had been able to prey on National Guard resources before, as it had been \na relatively weak institution headed by a commoner.51 In 1964, after Saud\u2019s final defeat by \nFaisal, the Royal Guard was attached to the Ministry of Defence, implying its disbandment as \nindependent institution. Institutional design followed power politics, sometimes resulting in \nthe parallel existence of very similar structures.52 \n \nInstitutions as fiefdoms \nInstitutions being tokens in political games, they would also be used for building personal \nfortunes and expanding one\u2019s following. Proprietary patterns were established early on: In his \nlater years, Abdalaziz had \u201cgranted\u201d several of the new agencies to specific factions among \nhis sons, a process in which maternal lines played an important role. Examples include the \nRoyal Guard, the governorships of Riyadh and Mecca and the Ministry of Defense, all \ncontrolled successively by full brothers. Control of specific institutions through factions \nwithin the Al Saud has been a prevalent pattern ever since. Similarly, well-positioned \ncommoner families would develop a permanent claim over certain offices.53 \n \nMost senior figures used the institutions they controlled to personally distribute favours and \nconclude business deals. King Saud himself built up a following of contractors whom he \ndelighted with large contracts for palaces and grossly oversized ministries.54 Minister of \nDefence Mishcal \u2013 known as one of the richest princes in subsequent decades55 \u2013 was said to \nhave used his privileged post to keep millions of freshly minted riyals for himself, as did a \nnumber of regional governors.56 Most princes in bureaucratic positions quickly surrounded \nthemselves with growing numbers of hangers-on, advisors and business partners.57 \n \nDifferent princes had different followings: Saud tended to cling to the old foreign advisors of \nhis father,58 whereas Faisal had a larger number of Hijazi among his clients.59 Fahd later on \nwould bring more young educated Najdis into the state apparatus.60 Senior clients all had an \nurban background in common: often from client notable families, sometimes upstarts of \nindistinct background who would work their way up as loyal servants. Tribes were not \nrepresented in the new elite.61 More important in our context is that the elite was very small in \nsize and built in a top-down fashion by princes, with hierarchies between princes and \ncommoners very strict.62 Clienteles were local and did not represent broader social groups, as \nmost of society remained outside of the state\u2019s reach. \n \nFormal and informal authority in a fluctuating bureaucracy \nSaudi Arabia largely lacked an administrative tradition and societal checks on the \nbureaucracy. Combined with family politics, this meant that the unprecedented growth of the \nbureaucracy in the 1950s was not accompanied by much rationalization. Although some new \nagencies helped to increase the provision of public services,63 the sudden availability of \nresources also led to uncontrolled, Byzantine expansion based on patronage.  \n \nMany of the young administrators were highly inexperienced, especially the royal ones, who \nhad without exception been educated only in the royal court.64 A US dispatch described \nMinister of Defence Mishcal as dignified and serious about his job, but in terms of institution-\nbuilding, \u201cthrough lack of education, knowledge and experience, performance results have \nbeen practically nil as the Ministry remains unorganized and its procedures are on an entirely \npersonal basis. He [Mishcal] leans heavily for advice and recommendations on foreign \ncounsel.\u201d65 Similarly, by the time Talal\u2019s Ministry of Communications was reattached to \nFinance, he was said to have achieved very little.66 \n \nThe personalized nature of institutions went along with a lack of meaningful formal \nprocedures. In the 1950s, there were no proper systems of civil service training, seniority or \neven document filing.67 The US embassy at the time was trying to keep track of administrative \ndevelopment and drew charts of agencies, but \u201c\u2026the diagrams themselves have proved to be \nmost confused, since this Government does not lend itself at all well to such schematic \npresentation, \u2026the organization is so confused, particularly among the lower echelons, that an \nunwarranted level of research would be required in order to fill out charts at all these \nlevels\u2026since organization means little to this Government, it is very flexible and changes \nwith such rapidity that charts are outmoded almost before they can be prepared.\u201d68  \n \nAramco at the time kept a roster of Saudi public personnel, on which the government itself \ndepended due to lack of oversight over its fluctuating institutions.69 Several agencies, such as \nthe Ministry of Economy created in July 1953, remained merely on paper,70 as did senior \nministerial positions.71 When posts were actually filled, they frequently were just depositories \nfor clients of ministers or princes, adding \u201cexcess baggage\u201d to the bureaucracy.72 \n \nInformal authority determined the actual importance of institutions: The bits of \nbureaucracy which mattered were run by important princes or by commoners very close to the \ncourt. A formally important institution like the Ministry of Commerce, although headed by \nleading Hijazi merchant Mohammad Alireza, proved to be largely powerless.73 Undercut by \nsuccessive Ministers of Finance with better royal access, and with no commercial regulations \nemerging from the Council of Ministers, he complained about de facto having no role.74  \nConversely, a previously inconsequential post such as that of comptroller general suddenly \nbecame important when it was filled by senior prince Muscad bin cAbdalrahman.75 \n \nAs far as institutions mattered, their day-to-day operations were often carried out rather \nautonomously, with ministries run as fiefdoms.76 The administrative sprawl and personalized \nnature of authority meant that coordination between agencies was largely lacking, with \ndifferent institutions often producing directly contradictory decisions and jurisdictions \nremaining unclear.77 As early as 1952, six different entities were supposed to be in charge of \neconomic planning.78  \n \nState-society relations: mobility and local clientelism \nWhile the formal state was still small, unorganized and self-absorbed, its combination of \ngrowing resources and institutional fluidity meant that it offered great chances for the rather \nsmall number of those who were in the right place at the right time. Access to the expanding \ncourt with its growing needs for material supplies from the 1940s on offered great \nopportunities of social and economic mobility and influence-peddling. Many of the big Saudi \nmerchant families established their privileged positions as suppliers to King Abdalaziz, some \nof them being granted exclusive trade agencies by the king which they still hold today. \nPlayers from the Jomaih, Rajhi or Juffali families made their first appearance at the time, \noften emerging from rather humble Najdi background (Jomaih e.g. was the grocer of the king \nfrom the village of Shaqra, Rajhi a money-changer in the Riyadh suq).79 Several of the \nadvisors of the king and their offspring also used their positions to venture into business, \nincluding the Pharaon and Khashoggi families.  \n \nIn a related pattern, auxiliary positions at the court could be the starting point of public \nservice careers. Abdallah bin cAdwan for example worked his way up to head of the important \nMinistry of Finance branch in the (oil-rich) Eastern Province without any formal education, \nthanks to the intervention of then Crown Prince Saud, whose bodyguard he had been.80 Id bin \nSalem moved from being a mechanic to head of the royal garage and one of Saud\u2019s leading \nadvisors.81 Interpreters Abdallah Tariqi and Mohamad Ibrahim Mascud (the latter with the US \nembassy) would become Minister of Oil and Minister of State respectively.82 \n \nAbdallah Sulaiman\u2019s empire: mobility of commoners \nIt is the Najdi Sulaiman Al-Hamdan family which probably has combined both patterns \u2013 \nmerchant and bureaucratic mobility \u2013 most masterfully. Their story colourfully illustrates the \ncontingent, personalized and fiefdom-like trajectory of early institution-building as well as the \ngreat associated opportunities of clientelism.  \n \nAbdallah Sulaiman was a Najdi of humble background who worked his way up from clerk \nto first Saudi Minister of Finance and close confidant of Abdalaziz. Until the early 50s, \nSulaiman\u2019s Ministry combined an inordinate range of administrative duties, its subordinate \ndepartments including health, public works, education and agriculture. Their workings usually \nwere opaque and left great scope for patronage. The Ministry was well-known for its \n\u201cwidespread system of letting contracts on a basis of personal favoritism rather than expected \nperformance and cost\u201d,83 the beneficiaries usually being Sulaiman\u2019s merchant friends.84 \n \nAt the MoF-affiliated customs, Ottoman-inspired clearing procedures involved up to 30 \ndifferent signatures and kickbacks were common. A British diplomat commented sardonically \nthat \u201cThe Director of Posts proudly proclaims that he had British training. There are naturally \nSaudi improvements on this; the postage stamp clerk, for instance, will take the money for \nletters and stick the stamps on later; after eighteen months in the job he can build himself a \nlarge house.\u201d85  \n \nSulaiman himself, based in Jeddah, was given large administrative discretion by the \nking.86 His brother Hamad and his son Abdalaziz were vice and deputy minister respectively, \nthe higher rank for his brother being created specifically for him (it still exists today).87 Apart \nfrom profiteering activities, Hamad was reported to be largely inactive.88  \n \nSulaiman had started to procure government supplies through figureheads in the 1920s, \nand his friends among the merchants lent him money without interest, which was in turn used \nto purchase goods for the court for inflated prices.89 He was given the lucrative cement \nfranchise for the Hijaz in the late 40s.90 Sulaiman owned palaces and large tracts of land, and \nhad his own entourage of some 400 people. After retiring in 1954, he ran hotels and a number \nof trading companies. His descendants still are among the prominent merchants of Jeddah.91 \n \nSeveral big businessmen were \u201cmade\u201d or at least boosted by the MoF at Sulaiman\u2019s time, \nincluding some who served under him.92 The case of Hasan Sharbatli is perhaps the most \ncolorful example of how upstart clients could rapidly gain status and wealth. The diplomatic \nnote on him bears a lengthy citation:  \n \n\u201cClimaxing a rags-to-riches career illustrative of the fluidity of Hejazi mercantile society, \nHasan Sharbatli, Jidda merchant and public benefactor, recently received from the King \nthe title of Honorary Minister of State,\u201d making him the ninth of this kind. The title \n\u201cimplies no necessary assumption of government powers\u2026Sharbatli, who only ten years \nago was a fruit-vendor and small-time auctioneer in Jidda, reportedly gained entry into \nthe favored circles of the Ministry of Finance by sending to Hamad al SULEIMAN, \nbrother of the minister, a gift of fruit. So pleased was the recipient that he recommended \nthe appointment of Sharbatli as Government Purchasing Agent.  \n \nIn this capacity, Sharbatli evolved an eminently satisfactory relationship with the \ngovernment. Selling a hypothetical 5,000 riyals worth of fruit, he would then bill the \nMinistry for 50,000 riyals and subsequently share the profits with his sponsors in the \nMinistry.\u201d93 \n \nSharbatli accumulated a total reported credit of 43 million Saudi Riyal with the \ngovernment. Unable to redeem the debt for himself, Sharbatli became one of the biggest \ncharitable benefactors in the kingdom, recovering some of the sums for this purpose. He had \nbecome one of the richest men in the kingdom, had a virtual monopoly on pilgrim travel and \nhad reportedly given 500.000 Riyal for the establishment of the Saudi Air Force.94 He also set \nup his own bank.95 Sharbatli\u2019s case illustrates that, although the royal family was clearly at the \ncenter of the polity and of state growth, more or less random networks of commoners within \nand around the administration had great distributional leeway and offered great mobility at an \nearly stage \u2013 and the chance to position oneself for later decades. \n \nThe story of Sulaiman himself however also demonstrates how the local power of \ncommoners in the final analysis depends on royal patronage: The minister was a favourite of \nKing Abdalaziz, but not of his sons Saud and Faisal. Sulaiman and his family left the Ministry \none year after Abdalaziz\u2019 death. Even the most senior and trusted commoner with a large \npersonal clientele did not have any independent support he could count on once fallen out of \nfavour. \n \nExternal advisors and islands of efficiency: SAMA  \nBefore that, however, Sulaiman had rather surprisingly got involved in probably the most \nsignificant attempt at administrative rationalization in the 1950s: the creation of the Saudi \nArabian Monetary Agency (SAMA). In the early 50s, monetary chaos reigned in Saudi \nArabia.96 Interested in minimal economic stability, the US embassy and Aramco successfully \nlobbied with the king to accept US consultants into the kingdom.  \n \nUS advisor Arthur Young managed to convince Sulaiman and the king of the need for \nbasic monetary and banking regulation. Young was mandated by the king to draw up a charter \nfor what was to become SAMA within a few hours.97 SAMA would derive its income by \ncharging the government for its services. Its first head was also an American, and accountants \nwere hired from Lebanon.98  \n King Abdalaziz and Sulaiman had been convinced of the existential need for institution-\nbuilding in this strategic sector. SAMA charter and use of expatriate technocrats bolstered the \nrelative independence of the body. After temporary sidelining of SAMA by the MoF,99 in \n1957 the governorship was taken over by another expatriate, Anwar Ali, who had come to the \ncountry with an IMF mission and who was to hold the post as a confidant of King Faisal until \nhis death in 1974. Different from other \u201cfiefdom ministries\u201d, SAMA\u2019s well-paid leadership \nwould use its relative autonomy and Abdulaziz\u2019 and Faisal\u2019s clear reform mandates to become \none of the best central banks in the Middle East.  \n \nThe specific social and political structure of Saudi Arabia gave its political elite large \ntemporary autonomy \u2013 in this specific regard confirming rentier theory. The new external \nincome left much space for the individual patronage interests of state actors, and for \ndistribution and institutional design to be negotiated within the state. Much of the modern \nstate was originally created above society, following its own peculiar logic of fiefdoms and \ntheir lateral sprawl. In the 1950s, Aramco and the US embassy were probably the most \nsignificant lobbyists for bureaucratic rationalization in the kingdom, ahead of all domestic \ngroups.100 \n \nThe emerging bureaucratic order under Faisal \nFaisal\u2019s order by cabinet \nUS pressure was largely ineffective under Saud, with politics and institutional change \nfollowing elite dynamics as described above: despite US lobbying, no coherent budgeting \nhappened,101 and an American Point IV assistance mission was cancelled.102 It was under \nFaisal that some degree of order was brought into the government apparatus, as is explained in \nthe following section. But again, this was at least as much driven by royal family politics as \nby perceived development needs. Faisal\u2019s struggle with Saud was at its apex between 1958 \nand 1962, and it was in this period that institutions were reshaped most dynamically, with the \npower interests of the Faisal faction eventually prevailing. After 1962, a stable balance of elite \nforces combined with bureaucratic growth and regularization led to the \u201clocking in\u201d of \npersonal and institutional constellations at the core of the state.  \n \nSome of the institutional balancing games between Faisal and Saud in the field of security \norganization have already been adumbrated. After 1958, the struggle between the two brothers \nwent deeper than that, however: The core of what the Saudi state was to be was at stake in the \nconflict, with fundamentally different institutional concepts deployed by both players, \nreflecting the fluidity of Saudi governance structures at the time. \n \nThe Saudi drive for political order began with a May 1958 decree which enhanced the \nstatus of the Council of Ministers, with Faisal as Prime Minister. The reason was that a \ncoalition within the Al Saud had pushed for enhancing Faisal\u2019s standing against Saud, who \nwas, among other things, perceived to be favouring his sons over his brothers and incapable of \nhandling the state budget, which was in severe deficit.  \n \nThe decree gave the Council of Ministers the final authority in financial matters. The king \ncould return decrees to the Council, with further steps kept ambiguous. Although a step \ntowards formal government, the May 58 institutional redesign most of all reflected a \ntemporary personal balance of power between Faisal and Saud, as Saud was to remain king \nand Faisal responsible to him.  \n \nInstitutions at the very core of the state were pliable weapons in the struggle. Saud as king \nwith a court had larger quasi-traditional, patrimonial resources at his disposal and used those \nto increase his following through royal hand-outs and tours through the country. Faisal, \nconversely, promoted more modern institutions of rule to boost his otherwise inferior \nstanding, trying to curtail the royal budget and enforce cabinet rule. There was no superior \nconstitutional (or societal) framework to contain the struggle to be fought out within given \ninstitutions.  \n \nThe brothers\u2019 attitudes towards institutions could be quite instrumental, a point vindicated \nby the institutional track record of the two protagonists: In 1959 Saud reportedly planned \ncreating a Consultative Council with 120 members, including tribal representatives, ulama \nand members of the Al Saud. It would take over some responsibilities of the Council of \nMinisters and hold legislative power. 103 It very much looked like an attempt of Saud, at that \ntime inferior, to regain territory, as the king would appoint the Majlis. It is striking that \nsupposedly \u201ctraditional\u201d Saud would forward such a relatively progressive concept. \nConversely, Faisal was very reluctant to give up his traditional post as viceregent of the Hijaz, \nalthough that hampered homogenization of the national administration in Saudi Arabia. He \nused the post as a bargaining chip to attain the premiership.104 If politically expedient, Faisal \ncould hamper bureaucratic rationalization.  \n \nConversely, Faisal\u2019s build-up of bureaucracy was completely centred around his person. Until \nSaud temporarily regained power in 1960, Faisal achieved a certain separation of state and \nroyal family affairs and a degree of budgetary control and monetary modernization with IMF \nassistance.105 This he accomplished through stark centralization of authority, however. In \naddition to being Minister of Foreign Affairs and Finance, in April 1959 he also took over the \nInterior portfolio. Although this enabled Faisal to exert more control over regional fiefdoms of \nother princes, it created a bottleneck of decision-making.106 Rated a thorough individualist by \nAramco researchers, Faisal sat on decisions.107 Liberal Saudis, although sometimes conceding \nthat Faisal stuck to formal rules more clearly than Saud, deplored such over-centralization.108 \n \nThe Council of Ministers was, most of all, an instrument for Faisal to gain power through \nthe post of Prime Minister.109 It is true that after Saud\u2019s fall from grace in 1962, it improved \npolicy coordination somewhat \u2013 not least because the royal diwan as parallel political actor \nhad disappeared. Faisal was generally willing to devote more time to the formal workings of \ngovernment,110 seeing a degree of budgetary control and more clearly defined administrative \nunits as instruments of stability. Most of his reformist ambitions beyond the establishment of \nbasic order petered out soon after Saud had been stripped off all powers in 1964, however. In \na period of regional turmoil, Faisal was interested in stability, not rapid development. \n \nSaud, through his alliance with junior princes, seemed to temporarily introduce more \nplayers into decision-making. This was an outcome of his alliance strategy though, as was the \nprogressive-developmentalist orientation of the new cabinet \u2013 he had relied on his father\u2019s \nsmall and closed group of decidedly reactionary Syrian advisors before.111 His younger royal \nallies in turn were further down in the seniority ranking \u2013 one can speculate that they saw \nprogressive politics as a shortcut to positions of power otherwise unavailable to them.  \n \nIn any case, the reformist episode proved short-lived, as Faisal\u2019s coalition with Fahd and \nhis full brothers drove out first Talal and his brothers, then Saud. Tellingly, it was the group \nwhich had built the larger alliance within the royal family which carried the day. At no point \nin the struggle were broader social constituencies mobilized.112 Talal and his princely allies \nmight have banked on support by \u201cyoung intellectuals\u201d, having seen the revolutionary \nexamples of Egypt, Iraq and Syria. In Saudi Arabia, however, this stratum remained small, \namorphous and incapable of action. Talal failed to rouse support.113  \n When progressive advisor Abdalaziz Mucammar briefly gained agenda-setting power \nunder Saud, this did not reflect a social revolution, but rather a temporary power vacuum \nbetween different royal factions. Mucammar and his small circle of friends had no \norganizational base to rely on and were quickly thrown out when Saud decided they were \ndoing damage to him. At any rate, Mucammar always knew that Saud had deployed him as \npart of a \u201cpower play\u201d114 and not because of a suddenly discovered reformist zeal. Other \n\u201cprogressive\u201d young Saudis such as Zaki Yamani and Hisham Nazer got the message and had \nthemselves coopted into senior administrative positions as docile technocrats under Faisal. \nCommoner administrators quickly stopped speechifying about political reform.115 \n \nConsolidation of fiefdoms: the 1962 cabinet deal \nThroughout the 1960s, the Saudi budgets once again continued to expand \u2013 quadrupling \nwithin less than a decade116 \u2013, and the bureaucratic apparatus grew with them, offering new \nmobility chances for commoners. Ministries of Petroleum, Hajj affairs, Labour and Social \nAffairs and Information were created between 1960 and 1963. After 1963 and until the oil \nboom, however, the growth of the budget implied growth of existing institutions rather than \ncreation of new ones. The expansion of a number of fiefdoms would continue, but in a much \nmore orderly manner.  \n \nThe cabinet which had emerged in October 1962 had become the gravitational center of \nSaudi politics and represented a post-Saud distribution of power which grew increasingly \nimmovable. It was based on a stable balance of forces within the Al Saud and was the end \nresult of the Saud-Faisal struggle. Faisal kept the post of prime minister, which he would fuse \nwith the kingship from 1964 on (a structure his successors have inherited).117 Faisal\u2019s senior \nallies in the conflict were rewarded with ministerial posts: Fahd and Sultan, young and \n\u201cmodernizing\u201d supporters, were given the portfolios of Interior and Defence, respectively. \n \nSticking to established patrimonial patterns, they brought in full brothers to take up \nspecially designated vice ministry posts in subsequent years.118 Sultan has kept his ministry \never since, while Fahd handed his portfolio over to his younger brother Nayef when becoming \nCrown Prince in 1975. Prince Abdallah, another ally of Faisal, was given cabinet status and \ncontrol of the National Guard in 1963, which he again kept until today. In 1967, the special \npost of \u201csecond deputy prime minister\u201d was created for Fahd, underlining his ambitions to be \nnext in line after his older half-brother Khaled, a moderate figure whom Faisal had made \ncrown prince for reasons of seniority and intra-family balance119 \u2013 despite his disinterest in \npolitics and lack of a previous government role.120 Institutional decisions again followed the \nroyal power balance. \n \nAll of the major princes embarked on the expansion of their institutions, which became \nirreducibly identified with their person. Growing budgets allowed for ambitious programs, \nmost remarkably among them Sultan\u2019s expansion of the Saudi air force in the 1960s.121 Staff \nnumbers, business opportunities and networks of gatekeepers, brokers and business partners \nexpanded concurrently. As the Ministry of Defence was organized around Sultan (and to a \nlesser extent his full brother deputies), all of its organizational units were oriented towards \nhim as central authority. Armed services and Ministry itself hence cooperated little.122  \n \nSimilarly, Abdallah was the figure around which the National Guard was organized \nconcentrically. Foreign specialists assessed the Guard\u2019s chains of command as ill-defined and \nover-centralized. As the Guard was also a government agency, the presence of civilians in its \nheadquarters, accountable only to Abdallah, decreased its administrative coherence.123  \n Faisal and the civil service: slow regularization \nBeyond the \u201csovereignty ministries\u201d, most of the other posts in the 1962 cabinet were \ncontrolled by commoners, as Faisal strove to limit the number of princes in the cabinet to \nmake it manageable124 \u2013 another pattern which would become \u201clocked in\u201d, as most of the \ncabinet posts reserved for non-royals then have been held by commoners until now.  \n \nA stable distribution of power did not automatically mean integrated government. Under \nFaisal the Saudi administration still suffered from enduring problems of over-centralization \nand lack of coordination between agencies.125 As institutions grew in parallel, functionally \nsimilar bureaucratic units reported to different ministries, and duplication and conflicts of \nauthority were endemic.126 As all actors were oriented towards Faisal, there was little \nhorizontal communication of commoner bureaucrats, while Faisal\u2019s brothers were busy \nbuilding their fiefdoms. The phenomenon of \u201cpaper agencies\u201d persisted, e.g. when a Ministry \nof Justice was decreed in 1962 but not actually set up until 1971. All good intentions of \ndevelopment planning got lost somewhere between agency conflicts and an insufficient data \nbase.127 The Central Planning Organization, set up in 1964, had little leverage over other \nministries during most of the 1960s,128 and several ministries never submitted their financial \nreports to the Ministry of Finance.129 \n \nHowever, different from the sprawl of the state in the 1950s, there was a clear \nregularization of bureaucratic growth \u2013 both in terms of stability of the overall set-up and of \ninternal bureaucratization of institutions. The set-up became less fluid. \n \nAlthough facing an acute shortage of qualified administrators, Faisal managed to assemble \nsome good commoner ministers around him, which might explain that at least some decisions \nwere carried through.130 \u201cElsewhere\u201d, as one UK diplomatic source explains, \u201cas so often in \ndeveloping countries, it [was] the bureaucratic bindweed that [took] root and proliferated most \nquickly, its function being to choke decision and action.\u201d \n \nThe \u201cbureaucratic bindweed\u201d however did go along with institutionalization of the civil \nservice, making for gradual institutional consolidation. Faisal achieved a discernible \nrationalization of the bureaucracy. As early as June 1958, a royal decree was issued reforming \nthe civil service. It clarified the classification of employees, salary schedules and criteria for \nhiring and terminating employment.131 The use of public offices for private gain was \nprohibited and severe penalties threatened. Private business activities of bureaucrats were very \ncommon at the time, and the Americans rated the decree as a serious attempt by Faisal to \ndecrease malpractice.132  \n \nTo be sure, overcoming the shortage of qualified and committed personnel was an uphill \nstruggle in a grossly undereducated society.133 In the early 1960s, the Institute of Public \nAdministration (IPA) in Riyadh was set up with international assistance and imparted basic \nadministrative skills on increasing numbers of Saudis. Having to start almost from scratch, its \nimpact was only gradual. At the end of the 1960s, the pool of skilled administrators was still \nvery small and recruitment often based on nepotism.134 Many bureaucrats were involved in \nbusiness interests tied to their respective agency.135 Absenteeism was rampant,136 and attempts \nby a large Ford Foundation consultancy mission in the 1960s to create a merit-based public \nservice did not yield significant results, as the \u201cCentral Personnel Bureau\u201d proved unable to \nbreak into the turf of other ministries.137  \n \nFaisal\u2019s own commitment to orderly and rule-bound administration should not be \noverstated. In his context, he was austere,138 but that did not mean that he did not have his \nown trustees, brokers and business clients whom he would pay off through various ways.139 \nThe Alireza family, close to Faisal since his time as Hijazi viceregent, was amply supplied \nwith defense-related contracts.140 Princes from Faisal\u2019s own family branch were heavily \ninvolved in business.141 Although the clientelist distribution of budgets and deals was \nrelatively well-controlled under Faisal, his rule was no exception to the basic pattern.142  \n  \nStill, all nepotism and clientelism occurred within a progressively bureaucratized \ninstitutional setting, whose main components and cleavages did not change fundamentally \nafter the early 1960s. The 1971 comprehensive civil service law led to further consolidation of \nbureaucratic rules and clearer formal concepts of salary scales, seniority and hierarchy.143 The \nInstitute of Public Administration augmented its profile under the leadership of Abdalaziz \nQuraishi in the late 1960s, and increasing numbers of foreign-trained Saudis entered public \nservice.144 The internal structures of agencies, though still fluid in many cases, were much \nbetter defined and permanent than ten years earlier.145  \n \nThe bureaucratic immortalization of fiefdoms in the 1970s \nWhen the Saudi system entered its final and dizzying phase of expansion after the 1973 oil \nboom, this expansion happened much more orderly and based on existing institutions than that \nof the 1950s.146 Paradoxically, bureaucratization and state growth also led to the entrenchment \nof existing fiefdoms in the boom \u2013 the final phase of state growth. As the budget quadrupled \nand total state employees increased from 52.000 in 1960 to 124.000 in 1970,147 royals had \ngrowing powers of patronage in their realms, while the entrenchment of civil service rules \nmade for increased institutional stability on lower levels.148  \n \nThe defence budget, usually above one quarter of overall state expenditure, allowed Prince \nSultan to expand his ministerial fiefdom to a full \u201cstate within a state\u201d, attaching large-scale \nhousing, health and educational infrastructure to his ministry. The biggest of Sultan\u2019s artificial \n\u201cmilitary cities\u201d in the Northern periphery of the kingdom was supposed to house 70.000 \npersons alone.149 While the Saudi military was gradually formalized, all organizational units \nof the ministry remained organized around Sultan as central authority, hampering \ncommunication between them.150 \n \nThe National Guard under Abdallah developed similar structures on a smaller scale, \nhaving its own \u201ccities\u201d and parallel housing, education and health systems.151 The Ministry of \nInterior under Fahd and Nayef, dubbed a \u201crule unto itself\u201d152 by a seasoned British diplomat, \nalso built up its own infrastructure.  \n \nAll of the major fiefs conferred enormous patronage power to their heads, through the \nsheer scale of employment,153 the provision of select services and numerous business \ncontracts of various sizes. Considerable parts of society were drawn into the orbit of the big \ngovernment agencies as clients in one form or another.154 \n \nThe dynamics of growth would often reinforce segmentation: Ministry of Defense, \nNational Guard and Ministry of Interior seem to have seen repeated competition over budget \nallocations, and there was a persistent overlap in security functions.155 The autonomous power \nof senior princes meant that they would ignore budgetary rules in their procurement, \nundermining coherent economic planning.156 The parallel build-up of independent housing \nand health services prevented integrated sectoral policies.157 The parallel power bases of \nprinces would make national decision-making and, on a lower level, day-to-day policy \ncoordination more difficult. \n \nSegmentation was reproduced on a smaller scale among agencies headed by trusted \ncommoners. Due to the underdevelopment of general infrastructure and public services, \nagencies under conditions of fiscal abundance strove to create their own services to be able to \ndevelop autonomously.158 Institutions would function in more predictable and formal ways \nthan in past decades; the civil service law was refined in 1977 and a further empowered Civil \nService Bureau created.159 However, the persistent hierarchical orientation of various agencies \nmeant that they often coordinated little in policy and budgeting matters. In the process of \nrapid growth they would acquire their own vested interests \u2013 and typically, their own housing \nand other infrastructure annexes, and in at least one case, their own TV studio and gas station \nservices.160  \n \nHowever, similar to the case of SAMA in the 1950s, further state expansion in the 1970s \nand early 1980s also allowed for some new islands of efficiency to emerge, staffed by the \nmost promising technocrats and given relative autonomy from the rest of the civil service. \nThese include the Saudi Ports Authority, the Saudi Arabian Basic Industries Corporation and \nthe Riyadh Development Authority.161 Although the core structure of state and regime \nremained unaltered, the oil boom still allowed for new institutional creations on a technocratic \nlevel, offering great mobility to aspiring administrators, some of them successfully co-opted \ninto the system despite their originally leftist leanings.162 Similarly, the boom was the last \ntime when new big business names were added to those that had emerged in the 1950s, most \nsaliently that of later Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri, who became a billionaire \nconstruction magnate under the patronage of King Fahd.  \n \nMobility closure and congealment \nThe institutional fluidity of the 1950s and 1960s and the enduring mobility in the 1970s \nand early 1980s stand in sharp contrast to the stasis and mobility closure since the mid-1980s: \nSince the end of the boom, the expansion of the Saudi state has largely stopped, and with it \nchange and mobility within the system. The institutions created since the early 1950s have \ncongealed into a permanent set-up \u2013 through bureaucratic formalization and resource \nconstraints, but also through the sheer size and scope of the state.  \n \nSome well-known facts suffice to illustrate how the end of the boom has brought and end \nto the internal dynamic of the Saudi system: Not only have all the leading princes clung to \ntheir posts (until death in the case of Fahd), but Saudi business has seen very few big \nnewcomers since the oil bust in 1986. The turnover of technocrats in the cabinet has decreased \nmarkedly, with their average age strongly increasing. \n \nThere has been little change in the set-up of government agencies, which have proven to \npersist once they had grown. The socio-economic entitlements created through state growth \nseem to have fettered the once so autonomous system, with the wage bill steadily increasing \nas share of public expenditure between the early 1980s and the late 1990s. As more social \ngroups have been tied to the state through the formalized clientage of employment and service \nprovision, the government, it appears, has become increasingly immobile, largely incapable or \nunwilling to impose cuts on the public payroll and subsidized public services.163 The \nstickiness of bureaucratic employment prevents institutional re-engineering. Policy in the last \n20 years has been limited mostly to \u201cputting out fires\u201d, with few grand initiatives.164 \n \nConclusion  \nFor those who know the modern Saudi bureaucratic behemoth, its unmovable institutions \nand administrative stasis, the great fluidity of early years as traced in this article is hard to \nimagine. The modern Saudi bureaucracy was created in the 1950s and early 1960s by an elite \nwhich was largely unconstrained by society or established bureaucratic structures.  \n The rapid, personalized creation of government institutions happened in a completely top-\ndown fashion and in a relative political vacuum. Political agency and voluntarism determined \nstate formation at least as much as the development needs of Saudi society did. The Al Saud \nlaterally expanded into a state apparatus which was most of all geared upon their internal \ndistribution of power. The rapid shifts in institutional design reflected the unique autonomy of \nthe early Saudi rentier state and its role as playing field for intra-elite balancing games.  \n \nSaudi bureaucracy-building often seems to be a case not of \u201cform follows function\u201d, but of \n\u201cform follows family\u201d. Institutional reforms often were instruments in an intra-elite power \ngame as much as attempts to modernize the state. Where Yizraeli sees primarily a clash \nbetween different ideologies of rule and development between Saud and Faisal, the present \naccount adds a rather more instrumental view of institutional initiatives by both players, with \ninstitutions as flexible tokens of power. It is not possible to glean specific princely \nmotivations from the archival record on every single institutional decision. We do know \nhowever that power politics within the family \u2013 whatever its details \u2013 consistently loomed \nvery large when it came to negotiating institutional change, like no other consideration. \n \nShifts in state autonomy  \nRentier state theory posits state autonomy as a result of external state income. As far as \nautonomy is a useful concept at all, the present historical analysis of Saudi institutions \nindicates that it is not constant over time: Early state autonomy seems to have been uniquely \nlarge, and political agency determined structures of rule. In later years, conversely, the weight \nof established structures has taken away much of the political and distributional leeway the \nSaudi elite used to have. The rentier argument that external revenues gives state elites free \nreign \u2013 at least in underdeveloped states with relatively cohesive elites \u2013 seems to make much \nmore sense in early phases of state-building and, to a lesser degree, while the expansion lasts. \nSimilar patterns may be at work in other late developing rentier states: Frequent shifts in \nalliance and redesigns of the fledgling Omani state under Qaboos in the early 1970s e.g. have \ngiven way to more static development in subsequent decades.165 \n \nPath-dependency of institutional design \nMany of today\u2019s permanent features of the Saudi state can be traced back to early \ncontingencies and the crucial juncture of 1962. Civil Aviation\u2019s attachment to the Ministry of \nDefense, the Vice Ministry of Finance, the large size of the National Guard, the omnipresent \nrole of the Ministry of Interior \u2013 all are outcomes of the politics of the day which happened to \nbe perpetuated by bureaucratic growth and\/or agreements to maintain a given power balance. \nSimilarly, the composition of significant parts of the Saudi private sector is an outcome of \noften chance encounters which happened many decades ago. The expanding Saudi rentier \nstate provides powerful examples of \u201cpath-dependency\u201d, the idea that relatively small early \nevents can have a strong influence on subsequent structural developments. The rapid growth \nof rentier states can lead to a \u201ctelescoping\u201d effect, magnifying the effects of early decisions \nmanifold, and locking them in as states grow mature and harder to change.  \n \nMore than any other event, the 1962 cabinet deal shaped the face of Saudi politics for the \nsubsequent half century, but it also appears somewhat contingent in retrospective: There were \ne.g. reported offers by Saud to make Fahd his prime minister, which the latter rejected.166 Had \nFahd accepted, Saudi Arabia and its institutions of governance would look much different \ntoday. There were also rumours that Mohammad bin Abdalaziz, an irascible older brother of \nFahd, could be made Minister of Finance, which again would have changed the balance of \npower \u2013 and quite likely, institutions \u2013 tremendously.167 \n \nInstead, sober Minister of Finance Prince Muscad bin cAbdalrahman controlled the fisc \nand helped to limit the intrusion of royals into the state. Although this policy was loosened \nunder Fahd, Faisal\u2019s decision to largely keep princes out of technocratic cabinet posts 1962 \nestablished a pattern which has been perpetuated until today \u2013 different from other GCC states \nwith large ruling families, which tend to have princely Ministers of Finance, Oil and \nCommerce.168 \n \nPath-dependency of state segmentation \nRegularization and growth of the bureaucracy helped to reduce the fluidity of \nadministrative structures, increasingly limiting change to the lower rungs of the state and \nentrenching senior office-holders within an established power balance. It also helped to \ndeepen the fiefdom character of certain institutions which dominate the Saudi scence today.  \n \nIronically, in the first place it had been the lack of clearly defined bureaucratic hierarchies \nwhich tended to give institutions the character of personal courts and enabled small-scale \nempire-building. With formal procedures under-defined, ministries were frequently used for \npatronage and to recruit allies \u2013 not only by royals, but also by well-positioned commoners, \nseveral of whom left their mark on the Saudi state.  \n \nAs the state grew more complex and the Al Saud delegated authority only in specific \ninstitutional contexts, the fragmentation of the state did not disappear, but was often \nconsolidated through bureaucratization. While Faisal\u2019s over-centralization persisted, agencies \noften kept their island character, communicating mostly vertically.  \n \nAgain, many institutional idiosyncrasies of Saudi Arabia would not be thinkable without \nrent surpluses that allowed institutional sprawl and costly redundancy. In a starkly contrasting \nexample from an originally quite similar country, John Davis has argued that oil rents in \nLibya allowed for the experiment of abolishing significant parts of the state.169 What these \ntwo most different oil states seem to demonstrate is that rents can most of all allow for \nunusual, possibly dysfunctional institutional experiments \u2013 without predicting what these will \nlook like. \n \nApproaching rentier states from this angle, the focus is once more on contingency and \nagency, which are in turn crucial to understand the internal heterogeneity of the Saudi state: \nOil income has in some cases has allowed for the creation of very efficient bureaucratic \nislands \u2013 SAMA et al, where select commoners played crucial roles \u2013, but in others has \nboosted neo-patrimonialism. As long as the system expanded, oil created great leeway to do \ndesign institutions freely and in very different ways. Generalizations about the nature of the \nstate are hence difficult: As political agency intervenes, rents do not automatically create \ninefficiency and corruption. At the same time, rapidly increasing rents might create a \ntemptation to build institutional fiefdoms, as these can be convenient devices to cement \ncoalitions within the elite. Again, this is not an automatic outcome, but the record of other oil \nstates indicate that it is a distinct possibility yet overlooked by rentier theories.170  \n \nSarah Yizraeli contends that the management of family politics through handing over \ncontrol of functionally differentiated formal institutions to senior royal players is more \nmodern that the old patrimonialism under Ibn Saud and his first successor, centred mostly on \nthe king\u2019s court. As soon as individual formal posts become royal fiefs of their own, this \njudgment might be questionable. The paradox of Saudi state development is that modern, \ndifferentiated bureaucracy and royal patrimonialism have grown concurrently. \n                                               \n1\n Cf.
