The fungal treatments produced extracellular enzymes in soil. Respiratory activity\nwas significantly (P=0.05) enhanced in soil with the inocula, and higher in the pesticide\nmixtures. Cellulase\/dehydrogenase increased in inoculated soil. Laccase increased\nsignificantly in the T. versicolor treatment. Degradation of the three pesticides by woodchip\naddition alone was enhanced (20-30%). T. versicolor increased degradation of simazine\n(27-46%), trifluralin (5-17%) and dieldrin (5-11%) and P. chrysosporium by 34-48%, 0-\n30% and 40-46% respectively, when compared with controls after 12 weeks. This study has\ndemonstrated that pesticide mixtures are differentially degraded by fungal inoculants and\nsignificant extracellular enzymes are produced in soil, even at -2.8 MPa water potential.\nThis suggests that effective bioremediation of xenobiotic mixtures using woodchips and\nfungal inoculants is achievable over a relatively wide water potential range when compared\nwith that allowing plant growth (-1.4 MPa).\n31. Introduction\nApplication of fungal technology for the cleanup of contaminants has shown\npromise since 1985 when the white rot species Phanerochaete chrysosporium was found to\nbe able to metabolize a number of important environmental pollutants (Sasek, 2003). White\nrot fungi possess a number of advantages that can be exploited in bioremediation systems.\nSince key components of their lignin-degrading system are extracellular, these fungi can\ndegrade insoluble chemicals such as lignin or an extremely diverse range of very persistent\nor toxic environmental pollutants (Bumpus et al., 1985; Barr and Aust, 1994; Hickey et al.,\n1994; Arisoy, 1998; Khadrani et al., 1999). The mycelial growth habit is also advantageous\nas it allows rapid colonisation of substrates, and hyphal extension enables penetration of\nsoil reaching pollutants in ways that other organisms cannot do (Reddy and Mathew, 2001;\nMagan, 2007). This can maximise physical, mechanical and enzymatic contact with the\nsurrounding environment (Maloney, 2001). White rot fungi can also tolerate a wide range\nof environmental conditions, such as temperature, pH and moisture levels (Maloney, 2001;\nMagan, 2007) and do not require pre-conditioning to a particular pollutant, because their\ndegradation system is induced by nutrient deprivation (Barr and Aust, 1994; Pointing,\n2001).\nA significant amount of research on white rot fungi has been conducted in liquid\nand\/or synthetic media, with less known about bioremediation capabilities in soil,\nespecially under different environmental conditions. Tekere et al. (2001) and Hestbjerg et\nal. (2003) reported that field conditions did not always enable white rot fungi such as P.\nchrysosporium to achieve optimum activity and therefore it was not a good competitor in\nthe soil environment (Sack and Fritsche, 1997; Hestbjerg et al., 2003). This last point was\nreinforced by Radtke et al. (1994) who reported bacteria from polluted and agricultural soil\n4to antagonise the growth of P. chrysosporium on solid media. Nevertheless, some studies\nhave described the successful application of P. chrysosporium as a bioremediation agent in\nsoil. For example, McFarland et al. (1996) described complete alachlor transformation by\nthis fungus, within 56 days of treatment. Reddy and Mathew (2001) also showed that this\nspecies was able to degrade DDT, lindane and atrazine.\nRecently, we demonstrated that under different osmotic stress regimes a range of\nwhite rot fungi were able to differentially degrade mixtures of pesticides in soil extract\nbroth (Fragoeiro and Magan, 2005). There was also an increase in a range of hydrolytic\nenzyme production including ligninases, as well as cellulases, even under water stress\nconditions. Although it is accepted that the extracellular lignolytic enzymes are at least in\npart responsible for the critical initial reactions of pollutant transformation, the production\nand activity of these enzymes in contaminated soil under different field conditions have not\nbeen examined in detail, although they are critical for successful degradation (Lang et al.\n1998; Baldrien, 2007).\nMost studies of bioremediation of pesticides have concentrated on single\ncontaminants only. For example, Tuomela et al. (1999) showed that Trametes versicolor\nmineralised 29% of added PCP during 42 days of growth in soil. However, soil\nenvironmental conditions were not studied in detail, which could have a big impact on\ndegradation rates. However, in contaminated soils pesticides are more commonly found in\nmixtures (Schoen and Winterlin, 1987; Bending et al., 2006).\nThe objectives of the present study were to examine the effect of using T. versicolor\nor P. chrysosporium as inoculants on a wood chip base in soil microcosms with different\nwater potentials (-0.7, 2.8 MPa) to examine the effect on (a) soil respiration over a period of\n12 weeks, (b) dehydrogenase, total liginolytic activity, cellulose and laccase, and (c)\ndifferential breakdown of mixtures of simazine, trifluralin and dieldrin.\n52. Materials and methods\n2.1 Soil\nThe soil used in this study was a sandy loam soil from Silsoe, Bedfordshire,\ncontaining 71.9% sand, 15.8% silt, 12.4% clay, 5.0% organic matter, 81.7 \u00b1 4.1 mg kg-1\nsoil extractable phosphorous, 4.7 \u00b1 0.2 mg kg-1 soil nitrate-N, 0.7 \u00b1 0.01 mg kg-1 soil\nammonium- N, organic matter: furnace 5.01%, titration 1.7% and pH of 6.1 (analysed by\nSchool of Applied Sciences, Cranfield University, Bedfordshire, U.K.).\n2.2 Soil moisture adsorption curve\nSince water availability determines the microbial activity in soil, prior to microcosm\nexperiments being carried out, a moisture adsorption isotherm was developed for soil by\nadding different volumes of water to 50 g of air dried soil, in the range 0.5-4.0 ml. Soil sub-\nsamples were left to equilibrate overnight at 4oC, before measuring the water potential with\nan Aqualab-Dewpoint Potentiometer WP4. This enabled accurate modifications of water\npotential to be made. The relationship between the amount of added water (ml) and\nresultant water potential is shown in Figure 1. The water potential of each microcosm was\nadjusted to -0.7 and -2.8 MPa by adding 10 and 5 ml of water to each jar (respectively).\nGlycerol:water (500-750 mls) solutions were used to maintain the steady-state ERH\nequivalent to the soil treatment water potential. These were changed regularly during\nincubation.\n62.3 Soil microcosms\nThe pesticide degradation rates, respiratory activity, total microbial populations and\nthe enzyme production in soil inoculated with the selected fungi were evaluated using soil\nmicrocosms. Each microcosm comprised 95 g of non-sterile soil and 5 g of inoculated\ncarrier, the same ratio described by Boyle (1995). Since white rot fungi are obligate aerobes\n(Pointing, 2001) aeration was ensured by using glass vessels for plant tissue culture (V-\n8630, SIGMA) with vented caps, with a polypropylene membrane 0.22 \uf06dm pore size (B-\n3031, SIGMA).\n2.4 Pesticides and incorporation into soil\nAnalytical grades of each pesticide: simazine (6-chloro-N2,N4-diethyl-1,3,5-\ntriazine-2,4-diamine), trifluralin (a,a,a-trifluro-2,6-dinitro-N,N-dipropyl-p-toluidine) and\ndieldrin (1,2,3,4,10,10-Hexachloro-6,7-epoxy-1,4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-octahydro-1,4,5,8-\ndimethanonaphthalene) were obtained from Greyhound, Birkenhead, UK. Simazine is a\ntriazine herbicide, whereas trifluralin is a dinitrotoluidine herbicide. Dieldrin is a\nchlorinated insecticide. These three compounds are included in the UK red list of toxic\nsubstances. Pesticide stock standard solutions were prepared by dissolving analytical\nstandards in methanol and storing in amber bottles at 4\u00baC. Working standard solutions were\nobtained by dilution with acetonitrile.\nPesticide solutions were diluted in water and added to each soil microcosm, in order\nto obtain the desired water potential and a final concentration of 0 and 10 mg kg-1 soil,\ndepending on the treatment. The fortified soils were then mixed using a mortar and pestle\nand left to equilibrate overnight at 4\u00baC, in the dark.\n72.5 Fungal inoculants and inoculation\nThe isolates used in this study were the white rot fungi: Phanerochaete\nchrysosporium (strain ATCC 35541; ME446) and Trametes versicolor (strain FPRL 28A),\nkindly provided by Dr Mike Challen (HRI-Warwick University, Wellesbourne, U.K.).\nIsolates were kept as slopes or plates on 5% malt extract agar (MEA) for up to 3 months at\n4oC.\nThe inoculum was prepared for each treatment fungus by growing biomass on moist\n(50% water content) sterile softwood wood chips for 4 weeks at 25\u00baC prior to inoculation of\nthe soil. The mixture of pesticides was added to the soil microcosms, and the different\ntreatments were: (a) control + 0 mg kg-1 pesticide ; (b) control + 10 mg kg-1 pesticide; (c)\nwood chips + 0 mg kg-1 pesticide; (d) wood chips + 10 mg kg-1 pesticide; (e) T. versicolor\n+ no pesticide; (f) T. versicolor + 10 mg kg-1 pesticide; (g) P. chrysosporium + no\npesticide; (h) P. chrysosporium + 10 mg kg-1 pesticide.\nThe inoculum was added to the soil, 5 g of inoculum per solid culture vessel\n(Magenta, Sigma Ltd, U.K.), which can be closed with plastic lids containing a permeable\nmembrane and then incubated at 15\u00baC, in the dark. Three replicates of each treatment were\ndestructively sampled after 0, 42 and 84 days and carried out twice. The initial soil moisture\nand fresh:dry weight ratio of each soil sample was determined by drying 8-10 g of fresh soil\nat 65oC to a constant weight.\n2.6 Quantification of pesticide concentrations in soil\n10 ml of methanol were added directly to 5 g of wet soil sub-sample in a conical\nflask, and agitated overnight. After extraction the solvent-soil slurry was poured through a\n8100 mm top diameter funnel lined with Whatman No.1 filter paper containing 1g of\nfiltering agent Celite 545 (Aldrich, cat. 41993) and collected in a 250 ml beaker. HPLC\nquantification of all three pesticides was performed with a Gilson HPLC system equipped\nwith a UV detector (117 UV detector, Gilson), Gilson 401C Dilutor, Gilson 231XL\nSampling injector, Gilson 306 Pump and Gilson 811C Dynamic Mixer, equipped with a\nAltima C18 5\uf06dm column (4 mm x 250 mm x 4.6 mm). The column was operated at\nambient temperature with a flow rate of 1.5 ml min-1 and an injection volume of 50 \uf06dl.\nAn isocratic mobile phase system was established using acetonitrile:water at a ratio\nof 70:30. The HPLC-UV detector was monitored at 215 nm. The HPLC method used\nenabled the separation and quantification of simazine, dieldrin and trifluralin in a single\nHPLC run (20 min) with simazine eluting at 3, trifluralin at 11 and dieldrin at 13 min. The\nlimit of detection for the three pesticides was 0.1 mg l-1 soil. Standard curves of pesticides\nwere made for each standard in soil extract broth and r-squared values for each curve found\nto be > 0.99 for all three pesticides. Initial studies were carried out at each treatment water\npotential to quantify extraction efficiencies (>80% for all) and these were taken account of\nin final quantification.\n2.7 Assessment of fungal growth and metabolic activity in soil\nSoil respiration: Soil respiration was measured by monitoring the\nconcentration of carbon dioxide in the head-space of the\nmicrocosm jars, using a Gas Chromatograph (GC) equipped with\na packed column (Porapak Q packed glass column) and a thermal\nconductivity detector (Carlo Erba Instruments, GC 8000 Series\nMFC800). The conditions of the analysis were the following:\ncolumn temperature 100\u00baC; injector temperature: 1000C; detector\ntemperature 180\u00baC; filament temperature 230\u00baC; carrier gas\n(Helium) and flow rate 40 ml min-1. CO2 concentration was\nmeasured by injecting 3 ml headspace gas and was estimated by\nreference to a standard calibration gas mixture (10.3 % CO2 in\nN2). The microcosm jars had vented caps, to allow gas exchange.\n9In order to obtain a detectable concentration of CO2 the vented\ncaps were sealed and left at room temperature for 3 hours, prior\nto CO2 analysis. Respiration rate was expressed as mg CO2 h\n-1 g\nsoil-1.\nDehydrogenase activity: 2 (p-iodophenyl)-3-(p nitrophenyl)-5-\nphenyl tetrazolium chloride INT (Acros 146-68-9) was used as\nsubstrate for soil dehydrogenase activity (Von Mersi and\nSchinner, 1991). The INT solution (9.88 mM) was prepared by\ndissolving 500 mg of INT into 2 ml of N,N-dimethylformamide,\nfollowed by the addition of 50 ml of distilled water. The solution\nwas sonicated for 2 minutes and water was added to bring the\nvolume up to 100 ml. The solution was stored in the dark and\nalways used fresh.\nThe method is based on the incubation of 0.5 g of moist soil with 375 \u00b5l of Tris-HCl\nbuffer (1M, pH 7.0) and 500 \u00b5l of the substrate INT at 370C for 2h, in the dark followed by\ncolorimetric estimation of the reaction product iodonitrotetrazolium chloride INF (I-7375,\nSigma). After the incubation every sample was mixed with 2500 \uf06dl of extraction solution\nethanol: N,N-dimethylformamide (50:50), and kept in the dark. The samples were shaken\nvigorously at 20 minutes intervals for 1h to extract the INF, produced in the reaction. After\nfiltration the developed INF was measured at 434 nm against the control. To eliminate the\nchemical (non-microbial) INT reduction controls were prepared with autoclaved soil\n(121oC for 20 min) and treated like the samples. For the calibration curve of INF: standard\nINF (Sigma I-7375) solutions of known concentrations in a range between 0.324 and 12.96\n\u00b5g ml-1, were prepared in N,N-dimethylformamide. 875 \u00b5l of standard solution was added\nto 2.5 ml of extracting solution and the absorbance was read at 434 nm.\nTotal ligninolytic activity: The poly R-478 (polyvinyl sulfonated backbone with\nanthrapyridone chromophore, violet colour) decolourisation assay was used to study the\noverall ligninolytic activity in the soil, following the method described by Baheri and\nMeysami (2002). The assay consisted of mixing 1 g of wet soil with 5 ml of dye poly R-\n478 (P-1900, Sigma) in aqueous solution (0.02 g l-1). The reaction mixture was kept under\nlight for 24 h for the enzyme reaction to take place. After 24 h the mixture was centrifuged\n10\nfor 4 min at 5000 rpm (Eppendorf centrifuge: Beckman Microfuge \u00ae Lite) in order to\nseparate the soil particles. Total ligninolytic activity was given as decolourisation degree of\nthe Poly R-478, monitored by the percentage reduction in the absorbance ratio at 520 nm\nand at 350 nm (Moredo et al., 2003) , calculated as follows:\nColour intensity = absorbance at 530 nm\/ absorbance at 350 nm\n% Colour of a sample = (absorbance at 530 nm\/ absorbance at 350 nm) sample x 100 \/\n(absorbance at 530 nm\/ absorbance at 350 nm) poly R478\n% decolourisation = 100 - [(absorbance at 530 nm\/ absorbance at 350 nm) sample \/\n(absorbance at 530 nm\/ absorbance at 350 nm) poly R478]\nA lower absorbance ratio, means intense decolourisation and higher enzymatic activity.\nLaccase and cellulase activities: Laccase and cellulase activities\nwere quantified on an enzyme extract, obtained from each soil\nsample. Enzymes in the soil were extracted by mixing 5 g of soil\nand 20 ml 10 mM phosphate buffer at pH 6.5, agitated in an\nincubator shaker at a speed of 250 rpm (KS501 Digital IKA\nLabortechnik) at 40C for 1 hour (Criquet et al. 1999). This was\nfollowed by centrifugation (Beckman Microfuge \uf0d2Lite), at 3800\nrpm for 6 min, at room temperature. The supernatant obtained\ncontained the fungal enzymes and was stored in 1.5 ml\nmicrocentrifuge tubes at \u201320oC.\nLaccase activity was determined with ABTS (2,2- azino-bis (3- ethylbenzthiazoline-\n6-sulfonic acid)) (A-1888, Sigma) at 405 nm, based on the protocol described by Buswell et\nal. (1995). The assay was carried out at ambient temperature, with the ABTS and buffer\nequilibrated at 37\u00baC. The reaction mixture, in a total volume of 300 \uf06dl (appropriate for 96\nwell microtitre plates), contained 150 \uf06dl sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, and 100 \uf06dl of\nenzyme extract. The reaction was initiated by adding 50 \uf06dl of 0.55 mM ABTS.\nLaccase activity was computed from the increase in A405, recorded in a microtitre\nplate reader (Dinex Technologies MRX Revelation) set in the kinetic mode (reaction time\nof 10 minutes, 5 seconds agitation at the beginning). Boiled enzyme was used in the control\n11\nsample. One activity unit was defined as the amount of enzyme producing a 0.001 increase\nin the optical density in 1 min at the conditions of the assay. This assay was first optimised\nusing commercial laccase from Rhus vernificera, crude acetone powder, minimum 50 units\nmg-1 solid (L-2157, Sigma), giving a positive result for laccase concentrations as low as\n0.03125 mg ml-1, i.e. 0.375 units per well.\nCellulase activity was assessed with carboxymethyl-substituted (CM-) and water\nsoluble polysaccharide derivatives labelled covalently with remazol brilliant blue R (RBB),\ni.e., CM-cellulose-RBB (Wirth and Wolf, 1992). The assay was performed in microtitre\nplates. The experimental procedure was as outlined in the Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBB)\nprotocol, supplied by LOEWE Biochemica. CM-cellulose (50 \uf06dl; 4mg ml-1) and buffer\n(50\uf020\uf06dl 0.2M sodium acetate buffer, pH 5) were equilibrated in an incubation chamber at\n37\u00baC. After the addition of 100 \uf06dl of enzyme sample the microtitre-plates were sealed with\nlow evaporation lid and incubated for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition\nof 50 \uf06dl of HCl 2N, causing the precipitation of the non-degraded high polymeric substrate.\nSubsequently the plates were cooled on ice (10 min) and centrifuged at 1450 g in a\ncentrifuge equipped with a rotor for microtitre-plates. Supernatants (175 \uf06dl) containing\nsoluble dye-labelled degradation products were transferred to a 96-well, half size EIA plate\n(175 \uf06dl, Costar, 1 cm path length) and measured spectrophotometrically at 600 nm. Blanks\nwere prepared similarly (3 replicates per treatment) but without the addition of enzyme\nsample during incubation.\nOne unit of enzymatic activity was calculated as absorbance variance (sample\nabsorbance \u2013 blank absorbance) x 1000 x min\u20131. This assay was initially optimised using\ncommercial cellulase from Aspergillus niger, minimum 0.3 units mg-1 solid, (C-1184,\nSigma), giving a positive result for concentrations as low as 0.002 units in the well.\n12\n2.8 Data handling and statistics\nData input, data handling\/manipulation, linear regression, and graph plotting was carried\nout using Microsoft Excel 2003 (Microsoft Co.). Other statistical tests (i.e. ANOVA and\nother statistical tests) were performed using XLSTAT\u00a9 (Version 5.1) and Statistica\n(Statsoft, release 8). When required comparison between means was carried out using\nANOVA followed by Tukey Multiple Comparisons test (P=0.05).\n3. Results\n3.1 Effects of treatments on soil respiration\nFigure 2 shows the effect of pesticide mixtures, fungal inoculant and water stress\ntreatments on relative respiration rates initially and after 6 and 12 weeks incubation at 15oC.\nIn natural soil the respiratory activity of resident microbial populations was low. Soil\namendment with wood chips enhanced respiration. Interestingly, the respiration of\ntreatments containing both fungal inoculants and pesticides resulted in the greatest\nincreased in CO2 evolution. Maximum respiration activity, as indicated by CO2 production,\nincreased after 6 weeks incubation. At -2.8 MPa water potential there was a significant\nincrease in respiration rates in the pesticide treatments, especially after 6 weeks incubation.\nBy 12 weeks the relative respiration rates in the inoculated treatments had decreased\nsignificantly (P=0.05), although this was still above that in soil alone or that with wood\nchips only.\n3.2 Enzyme activity in soil microcosms\n13\nDehydrogenase activity: The effect of treatments on the relative amounts of\ndehydrogenase produced by treatments at both soil water potentials is shown in Table 3.\nFor this parameter the differences between treatments with fungal inoculants were not as\nmarked as for respiratory activity. Overall, the activity of this enzyme was higher in soil\ninoculated with the fungal species + woodchips. For example, T. versicolor dehydrogenase\nactivity in the 10 mg kg-1 pesticide soil mixture was 80-100 % higher than in natural soil\nafter 6 weeks in the dry soil treatment (-2.8 MPa). With P. chrysosporium the levels of\ndehydrogense were significantly higher (P=0.05) initially and then decreased with\nincubation period.\nTotal ligninolytic activity: The ability to decolourise Poly-R478 in soil under\ndifferent pesticide and water stress treatments was used as an indicator of total ligninolytic\nactivity (Figure 4). In natural soil the total ligninolytic activity was not affected by water\navailability or pesticide treatment (P=0.681, P=0.454 respectively). However, incorporation\nof wood chips did impact on ligninolytic activity, especially in the drier soil. The\ndecolourisation rates were significantly higher in the pesticide treatments compared with\nthe control (P=0.05). In soil inoculated with T. versicolor the total activity was\nsignificantly higher at -0.7 MPa (P=0.013). There were no significant differences between\npesticide treatments, which suggested that the fungal inoculants were probably tolerant of\nthese compounds producing a similar level of decolourisation with or without pesticides\nbeing present. A similar trend was observed for P. chysosporium.\nLaccase activities: Laccase is an important enzyme exclusively produced by the\nfungal inoculants. This gave a good estimate of the ability of the fungal treatments to\nproduce this key extracellular enzyme and colonise the soil treatments. In natural soil the\nlaccase levels were very low (Table 1). In soil amended with wood chips there was a slight\nincrease in laccase activity, especially after 12 weeks incubation. Soil inoculated with T.\n14\nversicolor showed the highest laccase activity after 6 weeks incubation under both water\nregimes. Water availability did not appear to have any significant affect on laccase\nproduction in soil. In contrast, P. chrysosporium produced very low levels of laccase,\nregardless of pesticide or water treatments.\nCellulase activities: Production of cellulase varied with water availability and with\nfungal inoculants used (Table 2). The lowest production was in natural soil. This was\nslightly increased in wood chip inoculated soil. However, cellulase production was\nunaffected by T. versicolor growth in relation to pesticide or soil water potential. For P.\nchrysosporium there was higher cellulase activity in the drier soil treatment (-2.8 MPa),\nhowever there was no effect of pesticide treatment.\n3.3 Degradation of the pesticide mixtures in soil microcosms\nTable 3 shows the relative percentages (%) degraded of each of the three pesticides in the\nsoil microcosm treatments after 6 and 12 weeks incubation at both -0.7 and -2.8 MPa soil\nwater potential levels. In natural soil the percentage pesticide of the mixtures degraded\nvaried from 25-30% simazine, 50-60% trifluralin and 40-50% dieldrin after 6 and 12 weeks\nincubation. Woodchip incorporation (5%) into soil microcosms also resulted in a significant\nincrease in degradation rates of simazine and trifluralin but not of dieldrin.\nIn soil inoculated with T. versicolor there were good degradation rates of the three\npesticides after 6 weeks at -2.8 MPa. The increase in degradation was about 40% for\nsimazine, 50% for both trifluralin and dieldrin when compared to the controls. P.\nchrysopsorium had a significant effect on degradation rates, especially after 12 weeks. The\ndegradation rates for each pesticide in the mixture were about 64, 94 and 80% respectively\nafter 12 weeks at -2.8 MPa. Indeed the degradation rates were better than that in wetter soil,\nexcept for dieldrin which was completely degraded by P. chrysosporium.\n15\n4. Discussion\nThere have been very few studies which have examined the degradation of mixtures\nof pesticides by bioremedial microorganisms in soil in relation to different soil water\npotentials. In the present study we used a ratio of 5 g inoculant to 95 g soil. Other authors\nhave used very different ratios. For example, Novotny et al. (2003) described dye\ndegradation in soil using a 50:50 soil:straw based inoculant of Irpex lacteus; Canet et al.\n(2001) used a 40% incorporation rate with straw based inoculum; Ryan and Bumpus (1989)\nused a 25% straw-based inoculam; Elyassi (1997) used 10% straw inoculum; Morgan et al.\n(1993) used 4 g ground maize cobs to 1 g soil (=400%). We believe that some of these are\nvery unrealistic from a practical and economic point of view for bioremediation of\nxenobiotics in contaminated soils. Furthermore, few if any examined the impact of water\npotential or effect on mixtures of pesticides. Novotny et al. (1999) used the same species\nused in the present study and Pleurotus ostreatus, and found the latter species to be better\nthan both P. chrysosporium and T. versicolor. However, they used sterile soil only, devoid\nof any of the natural microbial communities which would be present.\nPesticides degradation rates showed that treatments with wood chips alone or that\nwith the fungal inoculants gave significantly increased degradation rates. However, there\nwere differential effects on pecticides when they were in soil as mixtures. T. versicolor\nincreased degradation of simazine by between 27-46%, trifluralin by 5-17% and dieldrin by\n5-11% at the two water potentials and P. chrysosporium by 34-48%, 0-30% and 40-46%\nrespectively, when compared to untreated controls after 12 weeks.\nAn important result was the incorporation of woodchips. This gave a significant\nenhancement of breakdown by probably providing foci for colonisation by microorganisms\n16\nincluding fungi of the substrate and by thus facilitating production of a wide range of key\nhydrolytic enzymes including laccases and ligninases which would enable degradation of\nthe pesticide mixture.\nHowever, the relative amounts of each pesticide remaining varied with inoculant\nfungal species. Thus enhancement of degradation of mixed xenobiotics may be complex\nand depend on the actual microorganism used, the mixture of pesticides present, the soil\ntype and environmental conditions. White rot fungi grow into wood fibres secreting\nligninolytic enzymes which depolymerises the lignin (Meyami and Baheri, 2003).\nHowever, they do not normally grow in soil unless provided with a substrate source (e.g.\nstraw, wood chips or saw dust).\nThis was supported by the respiration measurements of the different treatments.\nHigher CO2 production rates indicated higher respiration rates, suggesting potentially\nhigher mineralization rates. This is usually a good indicator that biodegradation of\npesticides by native or introduced fungi was occurring. Respiratory activity appeared to\npeak at about 6 weeks and decreased by 12 weeks. This could suggest exhaustion of readily\ndegradable organic fractions during this period (Balba et al., 1998). In the present study soil\nmodification with wood chips resulted in an increase in respiratory activity of the total\nmicrobial populations in the soil microcosms by about 17% (Fragoeiro, 2005). This was\nprobably due to colonisation of woodchips by native soil microorganisms. There was a\nfurther significant increase by the presence of fungal inoculants and wood chips. Soil\ninoculated with T. versicolor or P. chrysosporium showed improved respiration rates in all\ntreatments with CO2 concentrations 11 and 14-fold higher in the 10 mg kg soil-1 pesticide\nmixture treatments. Although we only used a 5% woodchip incorporation, this process\nprobably also increased aeration of soil, enhancing metabolic activity of aerobic\n17\nmicroorganisms. Similar increases have been obtained with organic amendments such as\nalfalfa and bran (Boyle 1995).\nWater potential did have an effect on respiration rates, but this varied with the\ninoculant fungal species used. While plant growth is limited to -1.4 MPa, the present study\nhave clearly shown that the activity of microbial populations, especially fungi are effective\nover a much wider soil water potential range. There are few other studies which have\nexamined this important factor and the impact it has on microbial activity. Conant et al.\n(2004) showed that respiration rates were higher at -0.03 to -0.05 MPa than in drier (-1.0 to\n-1.5 MPa) soils. Other studies have suggested that fungal activity and enzyme production\nwere optimum at 30-50% (w\/w of dry soil) although the actual soil water potentials were\nnot determined (Meysami and Baheri, 2003).\nEnzyme production is a critical process to soil function, such as organic matter\ndecomposition and synthesis, nutrient cycling and decomposition of xenobiotics (Acosta-\nMartinez et al., 2003). In the present study detailed analyses has been carried out for the\nfirst time to examine a wide range of enzymes activities in relation to both degradatioin of\nmixtures of pesticides and water potential status of the soil. We have demonstrated that\nthere are significant changes in dehydrogenase, total ligninolytic acivity, laccase and\ncellulase activities in soil depending on soil treatment, inoculant growth and pesticide\nmixture used.\nThe addition of pesticides to soil resulted in an increase in dehydrogenase activity in\nmost treatments. In the control soil the addition of the pesticides alone enhanced activity\nwith higher levels at -0.7 than at -2.8 MPa. Soils modified with wood chips + pesticides\nproduced the highest levels of this enzyme after 6 weeks indicating a significant stimulation\nin microbial activity. In the fungal inoculated treatments there was also an increase in\ndehydrogenase activity. For example, soil inoculated with T. versicolor had enhanced\n18\nactivity after both 6 and 12 weeks at both water regimes. Higher activity was observed at -\n0.7 MPa. For P. chrysosporium there was a decrease in activity over the 12 week\nincubation period. Although previous studies have suggested that there is an increase in\ndehydrogenase activity the wetter the soil (Quilchano and Maranon, 2002) we found no\nparticular pattern in this enzyme in our steady state water potential treatments. Previous\nstudies have correlated single pesticide degradation with dehydrogenase activity. Min et al.\n(2001) reported that increasing concentrations of butachlor (22 mg kg-1 soil) in soil\nenhanced activity of this enzyme by the 16th day of incubation. Baran et al. (2004) reported\nhigher activity of this enzyme in presence of PAHs. Felsot and Dzantor (1995) suggested\nthat alachlor + organic amendments using corn meal resulted in an increase in enzyme\nactivity and degradation rates. They also suggested that organic amendments may enhance\nco-metabolism of high concentrations of pesticides in soil. In contrast, McGrath and\nSingleton (2000) reported that while PCP transformation in soil was rapid (250 to 2 mg Kg-\n1 soil) after 6 weeks remediation dehydrogenase activity remained low throughout. They\nsuggested that initial very high concentrations of addition of the PCPs may have been toxic\nto the microbes while P. chrysosporium did not improve remediation.\nThe activity of dehydrogenase is considered a good indicator of oxidative\nmetabolism in soils and thus of microbiological activity because of it being exclusively\nintracellular and being linked to viable cells (Quilcano and Maranon, 2002). It has also\nbeen suggested that it is short term substrate\u2013induced activity which may reflect the impact\nof chemicals on the physiologically active biomass of the soil microflora.\nTotal ligninolytic activity was used in this study as it gives information on the\nactivity of the whole set of enzymes involved in lignin degradation. The results in this study\nshowed that in all treatments the highest decolourisation occurred after 6 weeks incubation\nin soil amended with T. versicolor. There was no effect of pesticide treatments suggesting\n19\nthat the inoculants were tolerant of the pesticide mixture used. This is supported by our\nprevious studies with these same fungi in vitro where ligninolytic activity increased even\nwhen -2.8 water potential stress was imposed (Fragoeiro and Magan, 2005). There does not\nappear to be direct relationship between the ligninolytic activity and pesticide degradation\nrates in the present study. This has been previously observed with mixtures of diuron,\nmetalaxyl atrazine and terbuthylazine (Bending et al., 2002) although Alcalde et al. (2002)\nobserved correlation with oxidation of PAHS mediated by laccases.\nIn natural soil the level of laccases produced was very low or insignificant, whereas\nthat amended with wood chips showed some laccase production in some treatments,\nespecially after 12 weeks incubation. The highest level of activity for soil-amended with\nwood chips was observed in the 10 mg kg-1 soil treatment under water stress (-2.8 MPa; 22\nU g soil-1). The incorporation of T. versioclor resulted in the highest laccase activity, after 6\nweeks in both water potential treatments. It is interesting to note that even under water\nstress this species was very active at producing the extracellular enzyme. P. chrysosporium\nproduced very low amounts of laccase which confirms our previous in vitro studies\n(Fragoeiro and Magan, 2005) and by Novotny et al. (1999) in soil-based studies. Previous\nstudies have also shown different results with remediation of other pesticides. For example,\nSannino et al. (1999) showed that Cerrena unicolor did not produce laccase in the presence\nof 0.5-7 mg l-1 simazine. However, few studies have examined the implications of water\nstress on the enzymatic activity of soil inoculants. Boyle (1995) found that T. versicolor\ndid not produce laccase in soil at -3.4 MPa but higher activities were recorded at -0.9 to -\n0.4 MPa water potential.\nCellulase activity was increased by the presence of wood chips alone or by the\ninoculant P. chrysopsorium, especially in the -2.8 MPa treatments. Wood chip degradation\nrequired production of cellulases and hemicellulases by the native microbial populations\n20\nand this was evident from the cellulase production in this treatment. T. versicolor, which\nproduced higher amounts of the other hydrolytic enzymes discussed earlier produced much\nless cellulases than P. chrysosporium in these studies over the 12 week incubation period.\nOverall, there were some differences between enzyme production in soil\nmicrocosms and that in soil extract broth (Fragoeiro and Magan, 2005). The main\ndifferences were that while in soil extract-based liquid culture laccase and cellulase\nproduction was much higher at -0.7 MPa while in soil microcosms the optimum was at -2.8\nMPa. This study has confirmed the differential rates of pesticide degradation observed\npreviously in vitro (Fragoeiro and Magan, 2005). However, in soil microcosms the relative\nrates of breakdown of individual pesticides within the mixture were different although\nsignificant enhancement in overall breakdown of the mixture was achieved by the addition\nof the fungal inoculants when compared to untreated soil.\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology\n(http:\/\/www.fct.mct.pt) for supporting SF with a PhD studentship.\nReferences\nAcosta-Martinez V., Zobeck T., Gill T. and Kennedy A., 2003.
