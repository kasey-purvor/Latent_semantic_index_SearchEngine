Although  results  have  provided  detailed \npalaeoenvironmental information, potential errors can arise in accounting for sources of non-BSi. Here, I  \ncompare a conventional Si-only method to a Si\/Al wet-alkaline digestion method, which in theory provides a  \nmore  robust  correction  for  concentrations  of  non-BSi.  Late  glacial\/Holocene-aged  sediment  from Lake \nBaikal,  Russia  was used for  the comparison.  Results  showed no significant  difference between the two \ntechniques,  indicating  that  existing  Si-only  BSi  methods  are  suitable  for  reconstructing  environmental  \nchanges when levels of digested non-BSi are low to moderate.\nIntroduction\nMeasurements  of  Biogenic  Silica  (BSi)  concentrations  in  sediments  provide  a  valuable  tool  for \nreconstructing past environmental changes at both marine and lacustrine sites. Given the strong relationship  \nbetween BSi and primary productivity in the water column, measurements of BSi can often be interpreted as  \na record of surface water productivity (Nelson et al. 1995; Ragueneau et al. 2000). Measurements of BSi in  \nsediment cores also often provide a more pragmatic approach to obtaining accurate estimates of oceanic and \nlacustrine palaeoproductivity, due to its order-of-magnitude better preservation than organic carbon (Berger \net al. 1989). Analyses of BSi have enabled insights into large-scale palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental  \nevents (e.g. Haug et al. 1999; Cortese et al. 2004), including the role of the biological pump in, for example, \nmodulating oceanic  draw-down of  pCO2 (Broecker  1982;  Harrison 2000;  Ragueneau et  al.  2000,  2006; \nDugdale et al. 2004; Kemp and Dugdale 2006). \nOne problem with analysing concentrations of BSi in sediments is the absence of a standardised \nmethodology for its determination in aquatic systems. Various techniques exist including diatom\/microfossil \ncounting  (Leinen 1985;  Pudsey  1992),  normative calculation of  mineral  silicates  (Leinen  1977),  X-Ray \n1\/12\nUncorrected copy\nDiffraction (XRD) (Goldberg 1958; Calvert 1966; Eisma and Van der Gaast 1971), infrared spectroscopy  \n(Vogel et al.  2008) and wet-alkaline digestion (Hurd 1972; De Master 1979 1981; Eggiman et al. 1980; \nMortlock and Fr\u00f6hlich 1989; Muller and Schneider 1993; Lyle and Lyle 2002). Of these methods, wet-\nalkaline digestions are most commonly used due to the method's simplicity and perceived robustness relative  \nto other techniques (De Master 1981; Conley 1998; Conley and Schelske 2001; Sauer et al. 2006).\nAlthough several variations of wet-alkaline digestion techniques exist (see review in Sauer et al . \n2006), most studies follow either a timed sequential extraction (De Master 1979; 1981) or a single-step  \napproach  (Mortlock  and  Fr\u00f6hlich  1989).  A  feature  of  all  wet-alkaline  digestions  is  the  non-BSi \nsimultaneously digested alongside sources of BSi. Whilst  no statistical difference exists in the final BSi  \nconcentrations (Conley 1998), the process by which this pool of digested non-BSi is accounted for varies  \nmarkedly between the timed sequential extraction and the single-step methods. Either all Si is assumed to \noriginate  from  sources  of  BSi  with  no\/negligible  non-BSi  contributions  (single-step  digestion)  or \nconcentrations of digested non-BSi are corrected for assuming a constant rate of non-BSi release throughout  \nthe alkaline digestion (timed sequential extraction)  (Fig. 1a). An alternative and potentially more accurate \nmethod for performing non-BSi correction in wet-alkaline digestions may lie in an examination of the Al \nconcentration  within  the  digested  solution  (Eggimann  et  al. 1980).  In  alkaline  digestions,  strong  linear \nrelationships have been observed over time between the release of Si and Al from a range of clays including  \nallophane, kaolinite, illite and montmorillonite (r = 0.988, 0.998, 0.994, 0.997, respectively) (Kamatani and \nOku 2000).  Higher-resolution,  one-second measurements indicate that  these relationships are established \nwithin the first 10 minutes of digestion (Koning et al. 2002). As such, by assuming that concentrations of Al \nin BSi are negligible, measurements of digested Al can be used to directly account for non-BSi leached  \nduring the alkaline digestion. This may be particularly important in accounting for the rapid parabolic release \nof  non-BSi  that  occurs  during  the first  two hours  of  an alkaline  digestion (Schl\u00fcter  and Rickert  1998; \nKamatani and Oku 2000; Koning et al. 2002), which may lead to an over-estimation of the true amount of  \nBSi, particularly in samples low in BSi in which the relative contributions from non-BSi may be high.\nWithin a single-step digestion, Si\/Al ratios of catchment or clay standard material can be applied to  \ndigested concentrations of Si and Al to calculate BSi (e.g. Eggimann et al . 1980; Carter and Colman 1994; \nOhlendorf and Sturm 2008). Alternatively, Si\/Al ratios can be used to calculate non-BSi corrections through \na double leachate procedure, following an initial four- or five-hour alkaline digestion (Eggimann et al . 1980; \nRagueneau et al. 2005). Recent work has also focused on a single, sequential Si\/Al extraction technique, in \nwhich a linear regression to the y-intercept is used to separate out the non-BSi phase on aliquots collected  \nfollowing complete BSi digestion (Fig. 1b) (Schl\u00fcter and Rickert 1998; Kamatani and Oku 2000; Koning et \nal. 2002).  One  advantage of  this  particular  approach is  the  speed and ease with which samples  can be \nanalysed relative to other Si\/Al methods. In addition, the sequential technique allows the Si\/Al ratio of non-\nBSi to be calculated for every sample. Since this accounts for any variation in the clay matrix and non-BSi  \n2\/12\nUncorrected copy\nSi\/Al ratios between different samples, the technique potentially provides more accurate accountability for  \nlevels of digested non-BSi than a single step Si\/Al approach. Although individual non-BSi Si\/Al ratios are \nalso derived with the double leachate procedure, the need to recover, dry and weigh the analysed material  \nafter each digestion increases the risk of an error in the BSi calculations.\nTo date, the sequential Si\/Al method has been applied primarily to surface sediments (Kamatani and \nOku 2000; Koning et al. 2002; Ragueneau et al. 2005), with comparisons failing to indicate a significant \ndifference between conventional Si-only and sequential Si\/Al measurements of BSi (Schl\u00fcter and Rickert \n1998; Kamatani and Oku 2000). However, the sequential Si\/Al method has yet to be applied and compared \nto conventional BSi techniques in a long core section. Here, records of Si only (Si\/time) and sequential Si\/Al \nBSi were measured on cores from two sites in Lake Baikal, Russia (Fig. 2).  Sediment came from intervals  \ncovering  the  late  glacial\/Holocene,  a  period  of  variable  but  high  diatom productivity  and good diatom \npreservation (Morley 2005).  Carrying out  this  study in Lake Baikal  is  significant  given the role of BSi  \nconcentrations in elucidating the lake's palaeoclimate history (see below). By comparing the sequential Si\/Al \nand Si-only datasets, the degree of similarity between the two techniques can be ascertained, enabling a \ndiscussion of the relative merits\/disadvantages of each technique in documenting BSi changes in sediment  \ncores.\nMethodology\nSite location\nLake  Baikal,  Russia,  is  a  unique  site  for  studying  the  palaeoclimate  history  of  Central  Asia,  with  an  \nuninterrupted sediment  record dating back to either  the  Middle  Eocene (Hutchinson et  al.  1992) or the  \nMiddle\/Late Miocene (Williams et al. 2001; Sapota et al. 2004) (Fig. 2). One limitation of research in Lake \nBaikal is the very low amount of carbonate within the sediment record. However, with diatoms constituting \nc. 98% of all BSi within the sediment (Granina et al. 1992), conventional Si-only wet-alkaline measurements \nof BSi have been widely used to record variations in diatom productivity, and thereby palaeoenvironmental \nchanges, over both glacial-interglacial (e.g. Colman et al. 1995, 1999; Williams et al. 1997) and shorter,  \nmillennial\/interglacial timescales (e.g. Qui et al. 1993; Karabanov et al. 1998, 2004; Horiuchi et al. 2000; \nProkopenko et al. 2001a,b).\nIn this study, two sites, one each from the north and south basins of Lake Baikal, were selected for  \nanalysis, both having been cored in July 2001 as part of the EU CONTINENT project. In July 2001, a 3.9-m \ncore (CON01-603-5) was collected with a Kasten box corer.  It was taken in the north basin from an elevated  \nridge along the eastern side of the lake (Latitude: 53\u00b095'46''\u2032N, Longitude: 108\u00b091'37''\u2032W; Fig. 2),  a site \nsubsequently referred to as Continent Ridge. Continent Ridge represents a site of continuous sedimentation \nconnected, but morphologically isolated, from the Academician Ridge (see Charlet et al. 2005). In the south \n3\/12\nUncorrected copy\nbasin a 1.73-m trigger core (CON01-605-3a) and a 10.45-m piston core (CON01-605-3) were collected from \nVydrino Shoulder (Latitude: 51\u00b058'49''N, Longitude: 104\u00b085'48''E) (Fig. 2), an elevated plateau which shows \nno evidence of sediment reworking in the Holocene or late glacial (Morley 2005). Whilst the validity of BSi \nconcentrations as a measure of diatom productivity has been questioned in glacial-age samples from MIS  \n3\/2,  when  diatom  dissolution  was  extremely  high  (Swann  and  Mackay  2006),  results  of  laboratory \nexperiments (Ryves et al. 2001) suggest that these issues should not apply to the samples analysed here  \nwhere diatom dissolution is only low to moderate (Morley 2005; Rioual et al. in prep).\nFor cores from each site 64 samples were selected for analysis at approximately constant intervals  \nalong the  late  glacial\/Holocene  section  of  the  cores,  with the  exception of  intervals  for  which no  core \nmaterial remained following previous diatom and geochemical analyses. Accordingly, no samples cover the  \nlast c. 0.8 ka at either site. Dates for the analysed interval at Continent Ridge are based on radiocarbon dating \n(Piotrowska et  al. 2004;  Rioual  et  al. in prep).  Sample ages  for  Vydrino Shoulder  are also based on a \nradiocarbon age model (Piotrowska et al. 2004; Morley 2005; Morley et al. 2005) with dates updated to use \nthe INTCAL04 radiocarbon calibration curve (pers. commun. Rioual 2006) using OxCal version 3.10 (Bronk \nRamsey 2005).  To assess the potential  for  digested Al to originate from diatoms,  an additional  22 pure  \ndiatom samples from Lake Baikal, previously extracted and cleaned for diatom isotope analysis at Continent \nRidge, were dissolved and analysed for Si and Al using the same method outlined below. No pure diatom  \nmaterial was available or could be extracted in sufficient quantities for any late glacial or Holocene-age \nsample. Instead, all pure diatom samples came from the Kazantsevo, a warm period in Lake Baikal\u2019s history \nthat is broadly synchronous with MIS 5e (Shackleton et al. 2003). \nBSi methods\nSediment samples were freeze-dried with 40 mg weighed into flat-bottomed, acid-washed bottles containing \n40 ml of 5% Na2CO3,  within the acceptable sample-solution ratios proposed by Gehlen and van Raaphorst  \n(1993). A recent debate has arisen over the need to pre-treat samples with HCl and H2O2 prior to digestion, to \nremove newly formed alumino-silicates and, consequently, improve the accuracy of BSi measurements. So \nfar, however, the need for such pre-treatment has only been demonstrated in soil samples (Saccone et al.  \n2006). Since existing BSi techniques either use (Mortlock and Fr\u00f6hlich 1989) or do not use (De Master  \n1979,  1981;  Conley and Schelske 2001)  pre-treatment,  and because previous studies  have demonstrated \nsimilar results between the two techniques (Conley 1998), there is unlikely to be a significant advantage in \napplying a pre-treatment stage here. Given the non-calcareous nature of sediments from Lake Baikal, such a \nconclusion is in agreement with results from Ohlendorf and Sturm (2008). It has also been established that \nerrors and poor levels of reproducibility in wet-alkaline BSi measurements are most often caused by \u201chuman \nerror\u201d, such as may occur during the weighing of samples and solutions (Conley and Schelske 2001). With  \nany pre-treatment requiring several weighings and the recovery of small (<40 mg) samples without any loss  \n4\/12\nUncorrected copy\nof material, it is wise to avoid any pre-treatment whenever possible. Accordingly, no pre-treatment was used \nin this study.\nThe digestion procedure was the same for all samples, with measurements from a single sample  \ndigestion used to calculate both the Si-only and Si\/Al measurements of BSi. Samples were immersed in a  \nwater bath heated to 85\u00baC and periodically shaken throughout the digestion period to ensure full exposure of \nthe sediment to the solution. For each core, sample replicates were analysed to check method reproducibility, \nand a set of blanks was run every ten samples. Following complete BSi dissolution (within first three hours  \nof sample digestion), 2-ml sample aliquots were collected after 4, 5 and 6 hours of digestion and stored at c.  \n2oC prior to ICP-AES analysis. Concentrations of dissolved Si and Al were analysed using a Perkin Elmer \nOptima 3300RL ICP-AES at Royal Holloway, University of London. Whereas some laboratories employ a \nweak HCl solution to neutralise the alkaline solution following sample digestion (see Conley and Schelske  \n2001), here this stage was omitted to avoid diluting samples beyond ICP-AES detection limits. Instead, the \ncold storage of samples should have been sufficient to inhibit any further leaching within the aliquots. Prior  \nto ICP-AES analysis, aliquots were removed from the refrigerator and allowed to warm to room temperature.  \nSynthetic standards were produced and matrix-matched using the same alkaline concentrations as for the \nanalysed  samples.  Solutions  were  spiked  with  concentrations  similar  to  those  expected  in  the  digested \nsamples. All results were corrected for analytical drift and elemental concentrations in procedural blanks.  \nBSi was then calculated using both the timed Si-only sequential extraction (Si\/time) (De Master 1979, 1981) \n(Fig. 1a) and the sequential Si\/Al methods (Kamatani and Oku 2002)  (Fig. 1b).  Following Conley and \nSchelske (2001), the mean concentration of the three Si aliquots was used to calculate BSi concentrations for \nsamples that produced negative slope regression coefficients.\nResults\nAnalytical precision\nAnalytical  precision of  the  ICP-AES was 0.50 ppm for  Si  and 0.03 ppm for  Al.  Replicate  analyses  of \nsediment samples from Lake Baikal indicated a final mean BSi reproducibility of 0.60 wt.% SiO2 (1\u03c3) under \nthe Si\/time method and 0.79 wt.% SiO2 (1\u03c3) under the sequential Si\/Al method. BSi concentrations for both \nmethods ranged from 0-34 wt.% SiO2.\nMethod comparison\nBSi results for both methods at Continent Ridge and Vydrino Shoulder show large changes through the late \nglacial\/Holocene interval with concentrations peaking at 4.0 ka BP and at 1.5 ka BP (Fig. 3). Comparisons of  \nthe Si\/time and sequential Si\/Al methods at both sites indicate a strong 1:1 relationship between the two  \nmethods, which is significant at the 99.9% confidence level (Fig. 4).\n5\/12\nUncorrected copy\nDiscussion\nPrevious  work  on  diatom species  assemblages  in  the  same  samples  analysed  here  led  to  detailed  late  \nglacial\/Holocene palaeoenvironmental reconstructions (Morley 2005; Rioual et al. in prep; Oberh\u00e4nsli and \nMackay 2005). Holocene reconstructions at other sites in Lake Baikal have also been derived from BSi \nconcentrations  (e.g.  Qui  et  al. 1993;  Carter  and  Colman  1994;  Karabanov  et  al. 2004).  No  attempt  is \ntherefore  made here to relate the  observed temporal  changes in  BSi  to  palaeoenvironmental  conditions.  \nInstead, the discussion focuses on the possible advantages of using a sequential Si\/Al method over a Si\/time \nmethod.\nDiatom-bound Al\nUse of the sequential Si\/Al method to measure BSi assumes: 1) a constant linear relationship between the  \ndigestion of Si and Al from sources of non-BSi; 2) all Al digested during the alkaline extraction originates  \nfrom non-BSi with negligible\/no contributions from sources of BSi. Existing studies have demonstrated a  \nlinear relationship between the alkaline release of Si and Al from clay minerals, except during the first 5-10  \nminutes of digestion when Si release is greater than Al (Kamatani and Oku 2000; Koning et al . 2002). The \nextent to which this deviation occurs can vary spatially, according to the precise clay composition of each  \nsample (Koning et al. 2002). Consequently, part of the non-BSi release during this initial period will remain \nunder-accounted  for  when  using  sequential  Si\/Al  corrections.  The  errors  from  this  non-linear  phase,  \nhowever, will almost certainly be minimal relative to analytical and sample preparation errors, which are \nusually the largest source of error for BSi measurements (Conley and Schelske 2001).\nThe potential for digested Al to originate from diatoms, however, may introduce significant errors  \ninto any Si\/Al BSi measurement unless such concentrations are either minimal or accounted for. Within the  \nwater column, levels of diatom-bound Al are minimal with Al\/Si ratios of 8.3x10 -3 to 7.0x10-5 (Lewin 1961; \nMartin and Knauer 1973; Kamatani 1974; van Bennekom et al. 1989; Schl\u00fcter and Rickert 1998; Beck et al.  \n2002; Gehlen et al. 2002). Although additional Al can become incorporated into the diatom frustule at the \nsediment-water interface (van Bennekom et al. 1988, 1991; Dixit et al. 2001; Dixit and van Cappellen 2002; \nvan Cappellen et al. 2002; Gehlen et al. 2002; Rickert et al. 2002; Koning et al. 2007), the overall amount of \nAl originating from diatoms is likely to be negligible relative to contributions from non-BSi, particularly  \nwhen sample BSi concentrations are low. Although van Bennekom et al. (1989) reported fossilised diatom \nAl concentrations of up to 6 wt.% in sediments from the Zaire\/Congo deep-sea fan, a wealth of other data  \nindicates that fossilised diatom Al concentrations actually peak at c. 1.0 wt.%, with typical concentrations \n<0.3 wt.% and many concentrations c. 0.01 wt.% (e.g. Shemesh et al.  1988; Schl\u00fcter and Rickert 1998;  \nEllwood and Hunter 1999; 2000; Dixit  et  al.  2001; Dixit  and van Cappellen 2002; Lin and Chen 2002; \nGehlen et al. 2002; van  Cappellen et al. 2002; Kryc et al. 2003; Lal et al. 2006). \n6\/12\nUncorrected copy\nAnalysis  of  the  Kazantsevo pure  diatom frustules  from Lake  Baikal  reveals  a  mean diatom Al \nconcentration of 0.08 wt.% (1\u03c3 = 0.02). One variable that may play a significant role in determining the \namount of Al in diatoms is changes in the sediment clay composition (Koning et al. 2007). Late Quaternary \nsediments from Vydrino Shoulder, Continent Ridge and elsewhere in Lake Baikal are dominated by illite and \nsmectite (Fagel et al. 2003; 2007). While records show different relative abundances of these clays between \nVydrino Shoulder and Continent Ridge, no significant change in the relative clay composition has occurred \nat either site over recent  glacial\/interglacial cycles (Fagel et al . 2007). Consequently, it  is reasonable to \npresume  that  the  Kazantsevo  diatom-bound  Al  values  are  representative  of  concentrations  within  the  \nanalysed late glacial\/Holocene sediment samples. By assuming this, BSi concentrations at both sites can be  \nrecalculated  incorporating  a  mass  balance  correction  for  diatom  Al  concentration  of  0.08  wt.%.  Such  \ncalculations show that diatom-bound Al has only a negligible impact on the sequential Si\/Al BSi results. For \nexample, when using the Si and Al sample aliquot data at 0.8 ka BP at Continent Ridge (Si\/Al-derived BSi \nconcentration for this sample is 33.7 wt.% SiO2, the highest value observed in this study), a mass balance \ncorrection for a diatom Al concentration of 0.08 wt.% alters the final sequential Si\/Al-BSi value by only 0.13 \nwt.% SiO2.  When performing a similar correction for the Continent Ridge sample at 10.5 ka BP, which \nshows the highest Si\/Al regression gradient,  the BSi concentration was altered by only 0.23 wt.% SiO2. \nThese \u201cerrors\u201d are significantly less than the 0.79 wt.% SiO2 precision associated with the sequential Si\/Al \ntechnique, indicating that issues of diatom-bound Al can be ruled out as a factor in controlling the sequential  \nSi\/Al-BSi record for the samples analysed here.\nSi\/time vs. Si\/Al\nIn line with existing comparisons (Schl\u00fcter and Rickert 1998; Kamatani and Oku 2000), results here indicate \na strong 1:1 relationship at both Continent Ridge and Vydrino Shoulder between the Si-only (Si\/time) and \nsequential Si\/Al method for BSi values ranging from 0-34 wt.% SiO2 (Fig. 4). Although for most samples \nBSi concentrations with the sequential Si\/Al method are lower than the Si\/time method, this difference is  \nsmall (mean difference is 0.96 wt.% SiO2 at Continent Ridge and 0.73 wt.% SiO2 at Vydrino Shoulder) and \nwithin the combined Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) analytical reproducibility for the two methods (0.99 \nwt.% SiO2).  This is reiterated via a Wilcoxon signed-rank test  (p < 0.001 for both sites).  Although the  \nrelationship is reduced for samples containing less than 10 wt.% SiO2 at Vydrino Shoulder, this change is not \nsignificant with p < 0.01. For comparison, at Continent Ridge p < 0.001 for samples below 10 wt.% SiO2. \nAlthough more accurate measurements of BSi for both techniques may be obtainable with continuous\/high-\nresolution measurements of Si and Al throughout the digestion period (Muller and Schneider 1993; Koning \net al. 2002), the absence of such data here does not alter the strong relationship between the Si\/time and Si\/Al \ndata. The most likely explanation for the similar results between the two methods, given that both techniques  \nare dependent  on the same initial  ICP-AES data, is the absence of significant  alumino-silicate digestion \n7\/12\nUncorrected copy\nduring the  alkaline extraction. This is reflected in the low amounts of dissolved Al within the extracted  \nsample aliquots, with concentrations at both sites typically ranging from 0.05-0.30 wt.% Al (mean = 0.21 wt.\n% Al). Such values contrast with significantly higher aliquot Al concentrations in sediments from Continent  \nRidge during MIS 3 (mean = 0.54 wt.% Al, max = 0.82 wt.% Al, n = 12) (Swann 2007), although issues of  \ndiatom dissolution prevent a comparison of the Si\/Al and Si\/time methods with these samples (Swann and \nMackay 2006). Consequently, although in this instance no advantage exists in using a sequential Si\/Al rather \nthan a Si\/time methodology, the Si\/Al technique may still represent a  more accurate measure of BSi for \nsamples in which sources of non-BSi are more easily digested. To this end, further work is needed on both \nmarine  and  lacustrine  sediments  from  various  locations  to  compare  the  sequential  Si\/Al  technique  to \nconventional  BSi  techniques,  particularly  where  clay  digestion  is  rapid  and\/or  high.  With  virtually  no \nadditional work required to analyse Al concentrations when using ICP-AES, and given that the amount of  \nnon-BSi digestion is rarely known in advance, it is also suggested that future studies aim to obtain both Si-\nonly  and  Si\/Al  measurements  of  BSi  until  the  absolute  accuracy  of  Si-only  measurements  is  better \nunderstood.\nConclusions\nConventional  Si-only  BSi  measurements  have  been  widely  used  to  estimate  siliceous  microfossil \nproductivity  in  both  lacustrine  and  marine  sequences.  Although  corrections  for  non-BSi  in  existing \ntechniques may appear overly simplistic (Si\/time) or non-existent (Si single step), samples here from Lake \nBaikal indicate no significant difference between conventional Si\/time or sequential Si\/Al calculations of \nBSi. This is attributed to the low concentrations of Al, and consequently low amounts of non-BSi, that were \ndigested from the analysed late glacial\/Holocene samples. However, because the magnitude of digested non-\nBSi is rarely known in advance, it is recommended that the sequential Si\/Al method be used in conjunction  \nwith Si-only measurements  of BSi  when using ICP-AES given the minimal amount of additional  work \ninvolved.\nAcknowledgments\nThis paper is submitted as part of the EU CONTINENT research project (http:\/\/continent.gfz-potsdam.de\/) \n(Contract no.
