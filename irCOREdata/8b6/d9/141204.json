Introduction\n2Acoustic Emissions (AE) is defined as the range of phenomena that results in structure-\nborne propagating waves being generated by the rapid release of energy from localised\nsources within and\/or, on the surface of a material [1, 2]. Typical frequency content of\nAE is between 100 kHz to 1 MHz. The application of AE on structural monitoring has\nbeen well established. The introduction of high frequency Acoustic Emission (AE)\ntechnology in the area of machine condition monitoring has been developing for over\nforty years [3]. The application of AE technology to monitoring a range of rotating\nmachines has been detailed in recent review [3] and its growth has principally focused\non applications for bearings, mechanical seals and reciprocating engines. Sources of AE\nin rotating machines include impacting and asperity contact.\nThe high sensitivity of AE in detecting the loss of mechanical integrity as compared to\nthe well established vibration monitoring technique has become its principle advantage\nfor machine health monitoring. However, the attenuation experienced by AE over\ndistances and across interfaces is the main drawback of this technology.\nThe application of AE for gearbox diagnosis and prognosis is still in its infancy. This\nprogram of research attempts to understand the influence of operating parameters on the\ngeneration of AE for both helical and spur gears. It should be noted that spur and helical\ngears experience a combination of sliding and rolling on either side of the pitch point\nand pure rolling at pitch point. However, due to the geometry of the helical gears, the\npitch point during gear mesh is not passed at the same time along the width of the gear\nlike during spur gear mesh, i.e., pitch point contact for the helical gear mesh is\nprogressive. Several researchers [4-6] have applied AE under sliding and rolling\nconditions and noted that asperity contact contributed to the generation of AE.\n3The most vital element for maintaining the mechanical integrity of gears is its lubricant.\n7KH\u0003RSHUDWLQJ\u0003OLIH\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003JHDUV\u0003LV\u0003YHU\\\u0003PXFK\u0003LQIOXHQFHG\u0003E\\\u0003WKH\u0003VSHFLILF\u0003ILOP\u0003WKLFNQHVV\u0003\u000b\u021c\f\u000f\u0003\nwhich is the ratio of the oil film thickness over the composite gear surface roughness. In\npractice, a ratio in excess of 2 is usually recommended for gears [7, 8].

The possible sources of AE during spur gear mesh have been detailed [10-\n12] with the principal source attributed to asperity interaction between the two gear\nVXUIDFHV\u0003 LQ\u0003 UHODWLYH\u0003 PRWLRQ\u0011\u0003 $V\u0003 WKH\u0003 VSHFLILF\u0003 ILOP\u0003 WKLFNQHVV\u0003 \u000b\u021c\f\u0003 FKDQJHV\u0003 ZLWK\u0003 WKH\u0003\ntemperature, surface roughness, load and speed of the gears, the level of asperity contact\nduring gear mesh will also vary.\nThis paper presents an experimental study that correlates AE activity to different load\nand speed conditions during the operation of a set of helical and spur gears.\nFurthermore, distinct differences in the meshing mechanisms of spur and helical gears\nare shown to have differing AE characteristics. This is the first known investigation at\ncorrelating AE and the operating condition of helical gears and forms the foundation for\na significant advancement in applying the AE technology to monitoring spur and helical\ngears.\n2. Experimental Setup and Data Acquisition System\nThe test-rig employed for this investigation was a standard back-to-back oil bath\nlubricated gearbox, see figure 1. The test rig was designed to be able to accommodate\n4both spur and helical gears. The test gears were made of 045M15 steel without any heat\ntreatment. Table 1 summarizes all the test gears specifications.\nTable 1 Test gears specifications\nSpur Helical\nNumber of teeth, pinion: gear\nBase diameter, pinion: gear (mm)\nPitch diameter, pinion: gear (mm)\nTip diameter, pinion: gear (mm)\nContact Ratio\nModule (mm)\nAddendum modification coefficient\nSurface roughness, Ra (\u021dm)\nFace width (mm)\nPressure angle (o)\nHelix angle (o)\nModulus of Elasticity (GPa)\n49 : 65\n138.13 : 183.24\n147.00 : 195.00\n153.00 : 201.00\n1.33\n3.00\n0\n2.00\n30.00\n20.00\n0.00\n228.00\n51 : 70\n150.06 : 205.97\n160.65 : 220.50\n166.65 : 226.50\n1.37\n3.00\n0\n2.00\n15.00\n20.00\n17.75\n228.00\nThe lubricant employed during the entire test was Mobilgear 636 with Extreme Pressure\n(EP) in order to keep natural pitting and wear to a minimum. Properties of the lubricants\nemployed during the test are detailed in table 2\nTable 2 Lubricant properties\nMobilgear 636\nViscosity @ 40 oC (cSt)\n@100 oC (cSt)\nDensity @ 15.6 oC (kg\/l)\nViscosity Index\nPour point (oC)\nFlash point (oC)\nPressure viscosity coefficient, \u012e (mm2\/N)\n680.0\n39.2\n0.91\n90.0\n-9.0\n285.0\n2.2X10-8\nDifferent torque conditions were applied to the gear via a mechanism that allowed a pair\nof coupling flanges to be rotated relative to each other whereby the shafts were twisted\nand lock the torque within the loop of the back-to-back arrangement, see figure 1. The\n5torque applied on the gears was calibrated by measuring the strain on the shaft using\nWheatstone half-bridge configuration located on the shaft connecting the two wheels.\nThree different Alternating Current (AC) electrical motors rated at 0.55kW, 1.1kW and\n2.2kW were used to drive the test rig at three different speeds of 700, 1450 and\n2850rpm. A hand held digital tachometer was employed to measure the operating speeds\nof the gearbox.\nFigure 1 Back-to-back test gearbox arrangement\nThe AE sensor used for the experiment was a wide band type sensor having a relative\nflat response between 100kHz and 1MHz at an operating temperature range of -65oC to\n177oC (WD model , \u2018Physical Acoustic Corporation\u2019). The sensor was attached to the\ngear pinion by using strong adhesive, see figure 2.\nA \u2018J-type\u2019 thermocouple (Iron-Constantan) rated from 0oC to 200oC was employed to\nmeasure the lubricant and gear metal temperature during the test. Two thermocouples\nwere mounted on the test pinion for recording the gear metal temperature and a third was\nlocated inside the oil bath. Figure 2 shows two of the three thermocouples mounted on\nthe test pinion.\nA silver contact slip ring was used to transmit the signal from the sensor and\nthermocouples on the rotating parts of the pinion to the data acquisition systems. The\nslip ring has the capacity to accommodate 12 channels with maximum speed of\n20,000rpm at operating temperature range between -20oC and 90oC. The slip ring is\n6capable of transmitting a maximum voltage of 50 volts and maximum current of 2 amps.\nThe continuous silver connections ensure minimal thermal error making it compatible\nwith thermocouple. The slip ring was located at the end of the test pinion shaft, see\nfigure 1.\nFigure 2 AE sensor and thermocouple location on test pinion gear\nThe output signals transmitted via the slip ring were then connected to commercial data\nacquisition card. The AE signals were pre-amplified at 20dB and 40dB during spur and\nhelical gear test respectively prior to data acquisition card. Figure 3 shows schematic\ndiagram of the DAQ system employed during the test.\nFigure 3 Schematic diagram of the Data Acquisition Systems\nContinuous AE r.m.s values were calculated in real time by analogue-to-digital\nconverter (ADC) controlling software. The hardware accelerator employed by the\nsoftware enabled the calculations of the AE r.m.s in real time to be performed. Each\nvalue from the ADC was squared and added into the accumulator by the hardware\naccelerator for a programmable time interval, 80 milliseconds in this instance which\ncorresponds to approximately 0.93 revolution of the pinion at the lowest speed\n(700rpm). The r.m.s was calculated by taking the square root of the accumulated squared\nADC readings. The accumulator is then cleared at the start of new time interval and the\nsame process repeated. The time interval for the acquisition was set at 80 milliseconds.\nAn anti aliasing filter was employed prior to the ADC card. AE waveforms were\n7acquired at the sampling rate of 10MHz and 8MHz for spur and helical gears\nrespectively. The waveforms were digitally filtered between 100kHz and 1200kHz.\nTemperatures were recorded at the sampling rate of 1Hz with the accuracy of + 0.1%\nand a resolution of 1oC.\n3. Experimental Procedure\nA series of tests was undertaken on both spur and helical gears in an attempt to\nunderstand the influence of load and speed on the generation of AE. Prior to every test,\nthe gearbox was run until steady operating temperature was reached (+1oC for the period\nof 30 minutes). AE r.m.s and gear temperatures were acquired in real time whilst AE\nwaveforms were captured at different periods during each test.\nThe first set of tests was undertaken at constant speed of 700rpm with five different\ntorque conditions of 60, 120, 180, 250 and 370Nm. Tests were undertaken in increasing\nload conditions and were repeated three times. The rig was run for approximately 10\nminutes under each load condition before the next load was applied.\nThe second set of tests was undertaken at three different speeds of 700, 1450 and\n2850rpm. This test was undertaken at four load conditions of 60, 120, 250 and 370Nm.\nFor this test, the rig was run for approximately 6 minutes on each speed condition.\n4. Experimental results and discussion\n4.1 The influence of load on AE\n8Results from the first set of tests generally showed an increase in AE r.m.s as the load\nwas increased for both spur and helical gears, see figure 4 and 5. The plotted values of\nAE r.m.s correspond to an average of 100 AE r.m.s data points acquired during the test.\nThe results show repeatability in AE r.m.s values at each speed for all three tests on both\nspur and helical gears.\nFigure 4 AE r.m.s at different speed for spur gear\nFigure 5 AE r.m.s at different speeds for helical gear\nDuring these tests, the maximum variation in temperature at gear mesh ranged from\n2.0oC for spur gears and 10.2oC for helical gears.

It is interesting to note that the\nvariation in largest temperature during these tests was for the helical gears.\nThe viscosity of the oil at the measured pinion temperature was calculated using the\nMacCoull equation, eq. (1) [13]. Oil film thickness was estimated during the test from eq\n(2) [7].

It is interesting to note that Tan et al [14] had shown that the rolling\naction of spur gears contributed to the generation of the transient bursts at a periodicity\nequivalent to the gear mesh frequency whilst sliding during the mesh was attributed as\nthe source of underlying continuous type AE waveforms. It is also known that the\nmeshing mechanisms for a helical gear is progressive due to the gradual increase and\n12\ndecrease in contact length over a particular tooth whilst the spur gear mesh has a\nconstant contact length throughout the gear mesh., i.e., unlike spur gear, the pitch point\nduring helical gear mesh is not passed at the same time along the width of the gear. This\nresults in the continuous occurrence of pure rolling at the pitch point in addition to the\nvarying slide-to-roll ratio away from the pitch point at all times during helical gear\nmesh. This continuous pure rolling activity generates series of transient AE bursts which\nare very close to each other thereby forming a high amplitude continuous type\nwaveform.\nLower amplitude AE signals resulted from complex combination of rolling and sliding\nwere buried under this high amplitude continuous type of waveforms.\nFigure 6 AE r.m.s at different load and specific film thickness for spur gear\nFigure 7 AE r.m.s at different load and specific film thickness for helical gear\nThe influence of load on the AE for both spur and helical gears can be summarized in\nfigure 8.

This is attributed to the relatively higher influence of changes in the\nspecific film thickness on the generation of AE from sliding in comparison to rolling. It\nis known that sliding is a source of AE as noted by Boness and McBride [4], Boness et\n13\nal [5] and Price et al [6]. However, the helical gear mesh mechanism involves\ncontinuous rolling action at all times making it less sensitive to changes in specific film\nthickness.\nFigure 8 Relationship between percentage increase in AE r.m.s as the\npercentage of specific film thickness was reduced for spur and helical\ngears\n4.2 The Influence of Speed on AE\nFigure 9 and 10 illustrate the changes in AE r.m.s for different pinion speeds on the spur\nand helical gear sets respectively. The plots show that the increase in speed results in the\nincrease of AE r.m.s level for all load conditions. This result contradicts\nelastohydroynamic lubrication theory whereby the increase in speed should results in the\nLQFUHDVH\u0003 RI\u0003 VSHFLILF\u0003 ILOP\u0003 WKLFNQHVV\u0003 \u000b\u021c\f\u0003 XQGHU\u0003 FRQVWDQW\u0003 VXUIDFH\u0003 URXJKQHVV\u0003 DQG\u0003 ORDG\u0003\ncondition thereby reducing the level of asperities between meshing surfaces [7]. If\nasperity contact is the only source of acoustic emission during gear mesh, the increase in\nspeed should reduce the AE r.m.s as a direct consequence of the reduction in the level of\nasperities between meshing surfaces. However, this is not the case since the increase in\nAE r.m.s with the increase in speed is attributed to the higher strain rate experience by\nthe asperities which generate larger amplitude AE response at higher speed and the\ncontribution of friction of the lubricant between the gears in mesh [14]. The increase in\nspeed will also increase the overall AE background noise levels from other gearbox\n14\ncomponents, i.e. bearings.. Interestingly Serrato et al [16] noted, for rolling element\nbearings, that the increase in speed should result in increased vibration damping\nexperienced between the rolling element and the race way due to the increase in film\nthickness but this was not noted; Serrato attributed the increase in vibration levels with\nincreasing speed to the change in dynamics of all contributor components of the system\nwhich resulted in increased vibration levels. It would have been of significant value had\nSerrato been able to assess the test bearing vibrations only.\nFigure 9 AE r.m.s for spur gear speed variation test (a) 60Nm (b) 120Nm (c) 250Nm\n(d) 370Nm\nFigure 10 AE r.m.s for helical gear speed variation test (a) 60Nm (b) 120Nm (c)\n250Nm, (d) 370Nm\nTable 4 and 5 detailed the measured values of temperatures and AE r.m.s and the\nFDOFXODWHG\u0003YDOXHV\u0003RI\u0003VSHFLILF\u0003ILOP\u0003WKLFNQHVV\u0003\u000b\u021c\f\u0003DW\u0003GLIIHUHQW\u0003ORDG\u0003DQG\u0003VSHHG\u0003FRQGLWLRQV\u0003IRU\u0003\nboth spur and helical gears.

This was due to the smaller face width on the\nhelical test gears which will result in a higher load per unit length, thereby generating\nhigher temperatures.\n16\nTable 4 Experimental results for the speed variation tests on the spur gear set\n17\nTable 5 Experimental results for the speed variation test on the helical gear set\n18\nThe maximum temperature difference during the test under the same load and speed\ncondition was 2.6oC (at 1450rpm, 250Nm) and 7.5oC (at 1450rpm, 370Nm) for spur and\nKHOLFDO\u0003 JHDUV\u0003 UHVSHFWLYHO\\\u0003 \u000bWDEOHV\u0003 \u0017\u0003 DQG\u0003 \u0018\f\u0011\u0003 7KLV\u0003 JLYHV\u0003 WKH\u0003 VSHFLILF\u0003 ILOP\u0003 WKLFNQHVV\u0003 \u000b\u021c\f\u0003\ndifference of 0.17 for spur gear test and 0.22 for helical gear test.

This results in no significant change in AE activity as\nconcluded by Tan and Mba [14] reinforcing the view that asperity contact was the main\nsource of AE activity during gear mesh. However, in this investigation, experimental\ntests were undertaken mostly in mixed elastohydrodynamic lubrication regime where the\n19\nlevel of asperities between meshing surfaces can change significantly with oil film\nthickness. This results in the change of AE levels as the level of asperities between\nmeshing surfaces changes with load.\nA 3-dimensional plot depicting the variations of load, speed and normalized AE r.m.s\nfor both spur and helical gears is presented in figures 13 and 14 and a numerical\nrelationship depicting this interdependency is given in equations 4 and 5. The\nnormalization of AE r.m.s was undertaken by considering the minimum and maximum\nAE r.m.s value as \u20180\u2019 and \u20181\u2019 respectively. The AE r.m.s values between minimum and\nmaximum levels were calculated as a ratio between \u20180\u2019 and \u20181\u2019.The fit error (Se) and\ncoefficient of determination (R2) for eq. (4) were 0.070 and 0.951 respectively whilst for\neq. (5) the corresponding values were 0.079 and 0.952 respectively. The loads employed\nin these equations are load per unit length applied on the gear face. The corresponding\nload per unit length applied on the gear was calculated based on the torque applied on\nthe wheel shaft, see table 6. The difference in load per unit length between spur and\nhelical gears under the same torque load was due to the difference in gear facewidth,\nrefer table 1. The minimum contact length for spur and helical gears were 30.00mm and\n20.33mm respectively. This results in higher load per unit length experienced in helical\ngear under the same torque.\nTable 6 Equivalent load per unit length calculated from the torque load\nTorque [Nm] Load [kN\/m]Spur Helical\n60\n120\n250\n370\n20.51\n41.03\n85.47\n126.50\n26.77\n53.54\n111.54\n165.08\n20\nln (z) =3.795 \u2013 82.284 \/ x 1.5 \u2013 202.844 \/ y 0.5 (4)\nln (z) = 2.767 \u2013 2.591 \/ x 0.5 \u2013 135.567 \/ y 0.5 (5)\nwhere\nx = Load in kN\/m\ny = Speed in rpm\nz = Normalized AE r.m.s\nEquations 4 and 5 were developed based on several assumptions;\na.

The speed range employed was between 700rpm and 2850 and the load range\nemployed was as stated in table 6.\nFigure 11 AE r.m.s at different speed, load and specific film thickness for spur\ngear\n21\nFigure 12 AE r.m.s at different speed, load and specific film thickness for\nhelical gear\nFigure 13 Estimation of speed, load and AE r.m.s relation for spur gear\nFigure 14 Estimation of speed, load and AE r.m.s relation for helical gear\nAnalysis on the influences of speed and load on AE r.m.s was undertaken based on the\nequations developed earlier (equations (4) and (5)). From equation (4) and (5). Doubling\nthe speed from 700rpm to 1450rpm increased the normalized AE r.m.s values by\napproximately 10- and 5-fold for spur and helical gears respectively. By increasing the\nspeed from 700rpm to 2850rpm (an approximate 4-fold increase) results in the increase\nof normalized AE r.m.s values by approximately 48- and 13-fold for spur and helical\ngears respectively. Since the increase in AE levels with the increase in speed is\nattributed to the increase in strain rate experienced by the asperities [14], the results\nagain suggest that sliding has a significant influence in changes in AE levels. It should\nbe noted that the increases are relative and do not suggest that AE levels are higher for\nany particular gear type; only that the sensitivity to change is higher for the spur gear set.\nIn addition, by increasing the load to approximately 2- and 6-fold (from 20.51kN\/m to\n41.03 and 126.50kN\/m) results in the increase of normalized AE r.m.s values by\napproximately 1.8- and 2.3-fold, and, 1.2- and 1.4-fold for spur and helical gears\nrespectively.

This holds true for the speed and\nload range employed during the test. In general, the results agree with Bones et al [4, 5]\nwhereby under asperity contact the increase in load and speed increased the AE level.\n4.3 Source of AE during spur and helical gear mesh\nFigure 15 and 16 shows AE waveform for spur and helical gear at 700 and 1450rpm at\n250Nm. The AE transients are clearly visible in spur gear waveforms as compared to\nhelical gear waveforms. The maximum amplitude at each burst on the spur gear\nwaveform is attributed to the AE activity generated from pure rolling at the pitch line\n[14] whilst the varying AE amplitudes away from the peak are attributed to the different\nslide to roll ratios away from pitch line, see figure 15.\nWaveforms associated with the helical gear mesh are of the continuous type representing\nthe AE activity due to continuous rolling activity at the pitch points.. Continuous rolling\nactivity during helical gear mesh results in series of AE transient bursts that are closely\nspaced as to form high amplitude continuous type of waveforms. In addition, the\ncontinued variation in the contact length during meshing of helical gears [17], which\n23\ndirectly influences the load conditions experienced by the gear, will lead to\nLQVWDQWDQHRXV\u0003 FKDQJHV\u0003 LQ\u0003 VSHFLILF\u0003 ILOP\u0003 WKLFNQHVV\u0003 \u000b\u021c\f\u0003 WKHUHE\\\u0003 UHVXOWLQJ\u0003 LQ\u0003 WKH\u0003 DPSOLWXGH\u0003\nvariations of the continuous AE waveforms attributed to AE during the mesh.

Conclusion\nSeveral findings have been observed and established from this experimental research\nprogram.\n1. AE is more sensitive to changes in specific film thickness under combination of\nrolling and sliding (spur gear) as compared to pure rolling (helical gear).\n2. A numerical relationship between load, speed and AE for both spur and helical\ngears was established.\n3. The variation in AE levels during helical gear mesh is speculated to be attributed\nto not only the influence of asperity levels but also to the variation in the contact\nlength during meshing.\n24\nThe findings from this research program will form the foundations for significant\nadvancement in applying AE to identify the lubrication regime within a gearbox thereby\nensuring optimal conditions for prolonged life.\nNomenclature\n\u012e = pressure exponent of viscosity (Pa-1)\nE1 = modulus of elasticity (Pa)\n\u0218o = dynamic viscosity (Pa s)\nu = entraining velocity (m\/s)\nR = equivalent radius (m)\nw = load per unit length of cylinder (N\/m)\nv = kinematic viscosity of the oil (mm2\/s)\nT = absolute temperature of the oil (K)\nA = constant for specific oil\nB = constant for specific oil\nReferences\n1.
