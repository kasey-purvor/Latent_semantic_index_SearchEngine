Such avascular tumours undergo diffusion-limited growth and, as a result,\nare typically at most several millimeters in radius. Following successful angiogenesis,\nthe tumour has its own vascular network which provides access to an almost limitless\nsupply of resources and permits unlimited growth of the tumour mass. The vascula-\nture also provides a route for tumour cells that break free from the primary lesion to\nmetastasise to other parts of the host organism. Thus, angiogenesis marks a tumour\u2019s\ntransition from a localised and relatively harmless lesion to a systemic and potentially\nfatal disease [21].\nAngiogenesis is a highly coordinated, yet extremely complex, process which\ninvolves degradation of the extracellular matrix, endothelial cell (EC) migration and\nproliferation, loop formation (anastomosis) by capillary sprouts, vessel maturation,\nand blood flow [43]. Further pruning and remodelling of the vascular network may\nbe stimulated by tissue-derived signalling molecules and blood flow conditions (e.g.\nwall-shear stress and pressure) [19,42]. The initiating event in tumour-induced angio-\ngenesis is the secretion of tumour angiogenic factors (TAFs), such as vascular endothe-\nlial growth factor (VEGF), by tumour cells usually in response to poor oxygenation\n(hypoxia) in the inner regions of an avascular tissue [22,41]. The TAFs diffuse through\nthe tissue until they reach the existing vasculature. There they stimulate the ECs lining\nthe blood vessels to form sprouts which migrate, via chemotaxis, towards the source\nof TAF, and to proliferate (for a detailed discussion of angiogenesis see [17,26,41]).\nIn view of its vital role in tumour growth, targetting angiogenesis as a therapeutic\nstrategy was initially expected to provide a significant breakthrough in cancer therapy.\n123\nAngiogenesis and vascular remodelling in normal and cancerous tissues 691\nThe rationale underlying such anti-angiogenic therapy is as follows: reducing the\nblood supply to a tumour will severely diminish its nutrient supply, causing it either\nto disappear or to shrink to a harmless, avascular state. A variety of anti-angiogenic\ncompounds have been identified and shown to act directly, by inactivating the TAF\nmolecules, or indirectly, by blocking TAF receptors on ECs. Unfortunately the success\nof early animal studies has not been repeated in clinical trials where anti-angiogenic\nagents used in isolation produce only modest increases in life-expectancy and long-\nterm survival (see [27] and references therein). Further investigations have revealed\nthat, when combined with conventional radio- or chemo-therapy, the net effect is\nconsiderably better with the anti-angiogenic agents than for radio- or chemo-therapy\nalone [27]. Teicher [49] hypothesises that the increased response occurs because the\ncombined therapy simultaneously targets two cancer compartments, the tumour and\nthe endothelial cells, rather than one [49].\nWithin fully vascularised tumours the situation is even more complex. Tumour\nvessels are usually immature and lack the well-defined anatomical structure of their\nnormal counterparts. Consequently, they are leaky and highly proliferative. Because\nthey are immature, they lack muscular tone and are prone to collapse under the pressure\nof the growing tumour mass. These structural abnormalities mean that tumour blood\nflow is often chaotic, with marked spatio-temporal heterogeneity in oxygen delivery.\nThese features create an abnormal microenvironment in which increased hypoxia and\naberrant tumour blood flow pose severe barriers to drug delivery and efficacy [25].\nThe situation is further complicated by the fact that angiogenesis continuously alters\nthe vasculature, making it extremely difficult to estimate, with confidence, the amount\nof drug being delivered to a tumour. As we explain below, the development of realistic\n(and validated) mathematical models of vascular tumour growth that account explicitly\nfor angiogenesis has considerable potential for resolving these problems.\nIn this context, it seems that normalising the tumour vasculature could improve\nthe delivery of drugs and oxygen to tumour regions. This is the mechanism by which\ncertain anti-angiogenic therapies are believed to improve cytotoxic drug efficiency [27,\n50,53]. The rationale behind such normalisation strategies can be explained as follows.\nIn pathology and normal physiology, angiogenesis is controlled by the balance between\nangiogenic promoters (e.g. VEGF) and their inhibitors. In normal conditions, feedback\nmechanisms ensure that, when the vascular density is sufficient to meet the metabolic\ndemands of the tissue, the inhibitors will eventually dominate and angiogenesis will\ncease. In pathology, the feedback mechanisms are disrupted and an imbalance in favour\nof angiogenesis persists. Using anti-angiogenic compounds to restore this balance\nshould, in principle, result in a more normal-looking vasculature. However, several\nstudies report that anti-angiogenic therapies antagonise chemo- or radio-therapy by\nreducing oxygenation and drug delivery. This suggests that there is a delicate balance\nbetween normalisation and (excessive) vessel regression, implying that extreme care\nis needed in the dose and schedule of normalisation therapies [27].\nInterpreting the vast quantity of clinical and experimental data relating to vascular\ntumour growth and angiogenesis is now creating a strong demand for a systematic\napproach to studying angiogenesis. Mathematical modelling represents a natural way\nto combine such data, test existing hypotheses, and generate new ones. As this view\nbecomes more widespread, theoretical modelling of the type presented in this paper\n123\n692 M. R. Owen et al.\nwill play an increasingly important role in improving our understanding of the complex\nprocesses that underpin angiogenesis and vascular tissue growth.\nThere is a long history of modelling angiogenesis in different biological contexts\nincluding tumour growth [10], wound healing and placental development, and an\nequally wide variety of theoretical approaches have been proposed (for a review, see\n[31]). For example, in [8,9] spatially-averaged models are formulated as systems of\ncoupled ordinary differential equations. Such spatially-averaged models can include\nconsiderable detail of the underlying biochemistry but are unable to account for the\nmorphology of the vascular network. The earliest, one-dimensional continuum models\nof angiogenesis focus on the proliferation and directed motion of populations of ECs\ntowards sources of VEGF and exhibit many experimentally observed features of angio-\ngenesis (e.g. acceleration of the capillary tips as they migrate towards the tumour, with\nthe maximum capillary tip density preceding the maximum vessel density) [16]. How-\never, they, too, are unable to replicate the detailed morphology of evolving vasculature.\nStochastic models which track the chemotactic movement of individual capillary tips\ntowards high regions of VEGF can account for details of the evolving vascular net-\nwork [7,47] and capture many characteristic features of angiogenesis. However, they\ndo not account for blood flow within the vasculature or consider the dynamic inter-\nplay between the evolving vasculature and growing tumour mass. Such models also\ntypically focus on a single spatial scale of organisation. As a result, they are unable to\nexplain how phenomena at different scales are coupled or to combine, in a systematic\nmanner, data from the different scales.\nMore recently several groups have started to develop mathematical models of angio-\ngenesis in which individual vessels form a network that delivers nutrients and drugs to\nthe tissue [11,23]. For example, McDougall and coworkers [32,33,45,46] have devel-\noped a hybrid model that focusses on vascular adaptation and angiogenesis, without\nexplicitly considering the tumour\u2019s growth. In [33] they showed that the structural\nabnormality of tumour vasculature could be responsible for the failure of blood-borne\ndrugs to penetrate large regions of the tumour [25]. Bartha et al. [11,28,52] have\nrecently developed a similar approach, which addresses the need to combine tumour\ngrowth with vascular remodelling, by considering a growing tumour which coopts\nan existing normal vasculature. Their simulated vessel networks are remodelled via\nvessel collapse, angiogenesis in the tumour periphery, and vessel dilation within the\ntumour.\nIn a series of papers, Alarc\u00f3n and coworkers developed a multiscale model of\nvascular tumour growth that links vascular adaptation, blood flow, oxygen and growth\nfactor transport at the tissue scale to the subcellular and cellular dynamics of normal\nand cancerous cells [2,5]. The basic framework was introduced in [4] and has since\nbeen extended to account for several features, including active cell movement [14],\nvessel co-option and dematuration and the effect of combination therapy [27]. The\nmain purpose of this paper is to show how this multiscale model can be extended\nto include angiogenesis. In the previous versions of the model the vasculature was\nassumed to undergo vascular structural adaptation, dematuration and collapse, but the\ntopology of the vasculature was considered to be static [4,5]. This means that new\nvessels and connections between them were not considered. In the present work this\nlimitation is removed.\n123\nAngiogenesis and vascular remodelling in normal and cancerous tissues 693\nThe paper is organised as follows. In Sect. 2 we describe our multiscale model of\nvascular tumour growth, focussing on the new features, such as angiogenesis and vessel\nregression, that we have incorporated. Numerical simulations are presented in Sects. 3\nand 4. Attention focusses on normal tissue growth and vascular adaptation in Sect. 3 so\nthat we can allow the vascular density to evolve or adapt itself to the metabolic demands\non the healthy tissue that it perfuses. We find that vessel pruning is highly sensitive to\nthe pressure drop across the vascular network, the degree of pruning increasing as the\npressure drop increases. Since angiogenesis is stimulated by VEGF, which is produced\nunder hypoxia, we find that the level of blood oxygenation regulates the extent of\nangiogenesis and the mean long term vascular density, with higher oxygenation leading\nto fewer vessels. We also find that the initial vascular architecture can affect its final\ndensity, particularly when the pressure drop across the network is high enough to\nsupport low levels of vessel pruning. Simulations that combine these features show\nthat network remodelling is best achieved via an appropriate balance between pruning\nand angiogenesis, in the sense that an optimal network oxygenates the tissue area with\nthe lowest possible vascular density. In Sect. 4 we assess the impact of introducing\na small cluster of mutant cells into the tissue. Tumour growth is accompanied by the\nformation of hypoxic regions and the production of VEGF, stimulating angiogenic\nsprouting, and causing the vascular density to exceed that for normal tissue. We also\nfind that if the original vessel network is sufficiently sparse, then the tumour can remain\nlocalised near to isolated parent vessels until new vessels bridge the gap to an adjacent\nvessel. The paper concludes in Sect. 5 with a summary of our findings and a discussion\nof directions for future research.\n2 Model description\nWe summarise below the main features of our multiscale model, starting in Sect. 2.1\nwith a description of the original model of vascular tumour growth on which it is\nbased before explaining in Sect. 2.2 how angiogenesis is incorporated. The interested\nreader is referred to references [4,5,15] for more detailed information about the basic\nmodel. In addition, Appendices A and B include further details of the model and a full\nstatement of the parameter values.\n2.1 General model framework\nOur basic model integrates phenomena occurring on markedly different time and\nlength scales. These features include blood flow and structural adaptation of the vas-\ncular network, transport within the tissue of blood-borne oxygen, cell division and\napoptosis, competition between the normal and cancerous cells for space and for vital\nnutrients such as oxygen, and the expression by the cells of growth factors such as\nVEGF, a potent angiogenic factor. Our theoretical framework is based on the hybrid\ncellular automaton concept which has been used to model many different aspects\nof tumour development (see [2,6,20,37]). As in [2], the model that we develop in\nthis paper accounts not only for species that diffuse through the tissue (here oxy-\ngen and VEGF), but also for subcellular and cell-scale phenomena, and the coupling\n123\n694 M. R. Owen et al.\nFig. 1 The structure of our multiscale model of vascular tumour growth. In this paper we introduce VEGF-\ninduced endothelial cell sprouting, leading to new vessel formation. In addition, vessels do not survive if\ntheir flow is too low for too long. The solid arrows indicate these new mechanisms, and dashed arrows\nthose mechanisms outlined previously [4,5,15]\nbetween them. To this end, our model is organised into three layers, which correspond,\nrespectively, to the tissue (or vascular), cellular and subcellular time and length scales\n(see Fig. 1).\nThe vascular layer Here we focus on the structure of the network and blood flow\n(see Appendix A.3 and [2,4,5,15] for more details). In an extension to our previous\nwork which focussed on hexagonal networks of blood vessels, with constant topology,\nwe now consider an arbitrary vascular network in which individual vessels undergo\nstructural adaptation (i.e. changes in their radii and haematocrit) in response to a\nvariety of stimuli. According to the structural adaptation law, the radius of a vessel at\ntime t , R(t), is updated with timestep \u03b5t according to:\nR(t + \u03b5t ) = R(t) + \u03b5t R(t) (Sh + Sm + Sd + Su \u2212 ks) , (1)\nsubject to RMIN \u2264 R(t + \u03b5t ) \u2264 RMAX, and where\nSh = log (\u03c4w + \u03c4ref) \u2212 kp log (\u03c4 (P)) (2)\nis the haemodynamic stimulus,\nSm = km(V ) log\n( Q\u02d9ref\nQ\u02d9 H + 1\n)\n(3)\nis the metabolic stimulus, and ks is the shrinking stimlus. Sd and Su represent the\ndownstream and upstream components of the conducted stimulus [40], which was\npreviously introduced into our multiscale model [5]\u2014however, for simplicity, and to\navoid obscuring the main issues (angiogenesis and vessel pruning), we neglect them\nhere.\n123\nAngiogenesis and vascular remodelling in normal and cancerous tissues 695\nIn Eqs. (1)\u2013(3), Q\u02d9 is the flow rate, Q\u02d9ref , km and ks are (non-negative) constants, H is\nthe haematocrit (fractional volume of red blood cells), \u03c4w = R\u2206P\/L is the wall shear\nstress acting on a vessel of length L and P is the transmural pressure. The magnitude of\nthe corresponding \u201cset point\u201d value of the wall shear stress, \u03c4(P), is obtained from an\nempirical fit to experimental data (see Eq. (22) in Appendix A.3). In [4] coupling to the\nsubcellular level was introduced by assuming that km = km(V ) where V denotes the\nlocal, extracellular VEGF concentration. To implicitly account for the pro-angiogenic\nimpact of VEGF, km(V ) was assumed to be an increasing saturating function, of the\nform:\nkm(V ) = k0m\n(\n1 + kVm\nV\nV0 + V\n)\n, (4)\nfor constants k0m, kVm and V0. In the following, except for comparison purposes in\nSect. 4, we set kVm = 0 since we replace this implicit angiogenesis with explicit\ngrowth of new vessels.\nIn addition to determining vessel radii we also compute the blood flow rate, the\npressure drop and the haematocrit distribution in each vessel. These in turn affect the\nvessel radii, forming a nonlinear feedback loop which is iterated until the maximum\nrelative change in radius across the network is less than some tolerance, Rreltol (see\nAppendix A.3). Thus we treat vessel radii, haematocrits and flows as being at quasi-\nsteady state with respect to the other layers of the multiscale model. Previously, we\nhave implemented flow-dependent haematocrit splitting at branch points according\nto Yen and Fung [54]. Here we assume symmetric splitting in order to focus on the\ndynamics of remodelling via pruning and angiogenesis\u2014we revisit this issue in the\ndiscussion.\nThe diffusible layer Indirect coupling between the vascular and cellular layers is\nachieved by the diffusive transport of oxygen and VEGF within the tissue, reaction-\ndiffusion equations being used to model the spatio-temporal evolution of both species.\nFor oxygen, C(x), the blood-borne haematocrit within each branch of the vascular net-\nwork acts as a distributed source while the cells act as spatially-distributed sinks. We\ncombine these features in the following dimensionless partial differential equation\n(employing the usual adiabatic assumption):\n0 = Dc\u22072C + 2\u03c0 R(x)Pc(Cblood \u2212 C) \u2212 k(x)C, (5)\nwhere Dc is the oxygen diffusion coefficient, R(x) is the vessel radius if there is one\nat position x and is zero otherwise, Pc is the vessel permeability to oxygen, Cblood\nis the blood oxygen level (assumed proportional to the vessel haematocrit), and k(x)\nis a consumption rate per cell which depends on the cell type at position x. A similar\nequation is used to update the extracellular concentration of VEGF, V (x), the cells\nnow acting as sources and the vessels as sinks,\n0 = Dv\u22072V + kv(x) \u2212 2\u03c0 R(x)PvV \u2212 \u03b4vV . (6)\n123\n696 M. R. Owen et al.\nHere, Dv is the VEGF diffusion coefficient, kv(x) is a cell type dependent VEGF\nsecretion rate, Pv is the vessel permeability to VEGF, \u03b4v is the rate of VEGF decay,\nand VEGF uptake by vessels assumes Vblood = 0. Normal cells are assumed to only\nrelease VEGF if their internal VEGF level is greater than a threshold, VTHR.\nThe cellular layer In the cellular layer, we concentrate on cell\u2013cell interactions (com-\npetition) between the normal and cancerous cells. The two cell types compete for\nspace and resources, the cancerous phenotype usually outperforming its normal coun-\nterpart. Competition between the two cell types is introduced by simple rules, which\nconnect the cellular and subcellular layers. For example, apoptosis (programmed cell\ndeath) in normal cells is controlled by the expression of p53 (whose dynamics are\ndealt with in the subcellular layer): if the level of p53 in a normal cell exceeds\na threshold value then the cell undergoes apoptosis. This threshold level is high\n(p53highTHR) if the ratio of normal cells to cancer cells in the neighbourhood of a nor-\nmal cell is sufficiently high, otherwise the p53 threshold for normal cell apoptosis\nis set to p53lowTHR. In this way, normal cells are more likely to undergo apoptosis\nat the edge of or within a tumour, providing a secondary mechanism for tumour\ninvasion.\nNote that, following [14], each element of the cellular automaton may contain more\nthan one cell, with each cell type having its own carrying capacity for cell division\n(Dm) and movement (Nm). In the following we set these carrying capacities to be one\nfor both normal and cancer cells, so that each element can contain at most one normal\nor cancer cell. However, we will set the carrying capacity for movement of endothelial\ntip cells to be greater than one, enabling them to move to locations that are already\noccupied. Movement is via a random walk, similar to that described in [14]\u2014each\nactive cell in a simulation is given a chance to move, in an order which is randomised\nin each time step. Section 2.2 below defines the transition probabilities, including a\nbias due to chemotactic gradients.\nThe subcellular layer Processes that are modelled here include the cell cycle, apop-\ntosis, and VEGF secretion, with ordinary differential equations (ODEs) being used\nto describe the relevant biochemistry. An important and distinguishing feature of our\nmultiscale model is the way in which the dynamics of the intracellular phenomena\nare regulated by (and regulate) extracellular factors such as oxygen and VEGF levels.\nIn particular, the cell division rate is an increasing function of extracellular oxygen\nconcentration, via the oxygen dependent degradation of the cell-cycle protein p27.\nIn contrast, the expression of p53, which regulates apoptosis, and VEGF increases\nunder hypoxia. Since the spatial distribution of oxygen depends on the spatial dis-\ntribution of cells (cellular layer) and haematocrit (vascular layer), processes at the\nsubcellular level are intimately linked to the behaviour of the other two layers: cell\nproliferation and apoptosis alter the spatial distribution of the cells (see Fig. 1); in\naddition, vascular remodelling is indirectly regulated by the cellular and intracellular\nlayers via VEGF which is released from the cells, diffuses through the tissue and acts\non the endothelial cells (ECs) lining the vessels. We refer the reader to Appendix A.1\nfor further details of the ordinary differential equations representing the subcellular\nlayer.\n123\nAngiogenesis and vascular remodelling in normal and cancerous tissues 697\nNew model features Before explaining in the next section how we explicitly account\nfor angiogenesis, we conclude this section by highlighting other features which are\nnew to our original multiscale model. First, our model can now simulate arbitrary\nvascular networks. Second, the rate of oxygen delivery from a blood vessel depends\non its haematocrit and its surface area (note that if the flow in a vessel is zero then\nwe set the haematocrit in that vessel to zero and the vessel cannot deliver oxygen\nto the surrounding tissue). Thirdly, we account for vessel pruning or regression. One\nof the earliest indications that low wall shear stress leads to vessel pruning is due to\nClark [19], who observed that small blood vessels tend to regress after a decrease in\nflow. More recent evidence suggests that this is initiated via apoptosis of endothelial\ncells [34,42]. To model this process, if the wall shear stress in a vessel falls below\na threshold value, \u03c4 critw , then a timer starts. We chose this threshold to be an order\nof magnitude less than the typical WSS seen in our basic simulations. The timer is\nonly reset if the wall shear stress rises back above \u03c4 critw . If the timer remains active\nfor longer than a prescribed period, Tprune (i.e. the time the vessel can survive with\nimpaired blood flow), then that branch is removed from the vascular network.\nWe remark that removing vessels from the network alters its topology and could (in\nprinciple) lead to the formation of blunt-ended vessels. If this happens then the resulting\nblunt-ended vessels will be pruned in the same way (since they cannot support blood\nflow) unless they establish new connections that permit flow. Finally we remark that\nin our model the dynamics of the normal and cancerous cells are tightly coupled to the\nvascular dynamics, a feature which distinguishes our model from the hybrid models\nof vascular adaptation developed by McDougall and coworkers [18,32,33,45,46].\n2.2 Angiogenesis submodel\nAs mentioned in Sect. 1, the main aim of this paper is to extend our multiscale model\nto include angiogenesis. As in our original multiscale model, VEGF is expressed and\nsecreted by hypoxic cells [4] and diffuses through the tissue. Extracellular VEGF\nstimulates the ECs that line existing vessels to form blunt-ended capillary sprouts\nwhose tip cells migrate via chemotaxis up spatial gradients in VEGF, new ECs being\nproduced by mitosis at the precise rate necessary to maintain a contiguous sprout\nbetween the capillary tip cell and its parent vessel. ECs contained within such blunt-\nended vessels will not experience any flow. As such their wall shear stress will be zero.\nAs for the circulating vasculature, we assume that capillary sprouts can withstand this\nlack of flow for only a finite period of time: failure to form a connection before\nthis period has elapsed results in regression of the entire sprout. When a tip cell\nanastomoses with another vessel (or sprout) then the new loop is included in the\nvascular network.\nIn more detail, the algorithm that we implement to simulate angiogenesis proceeds\nas follows:\n\u2013 In each time step \u2206t , and for each lattice site i occupied by a vessel, new sprouts\nare formed with a probability, Psprout, that depends on the local concentration of\nVEGF via\n123\n698 M. R. Owen et al.\nPsprout = \u2206t\nPmaxsproutV\nVsprout + V , (7)\nwhere Psprout = 0 if the number of cells at site i exceeds Em . Thus Em characterises\nthe space required for sprout emergence. Around the base of each sprout, we\ndefine a radius of exclusion, Rex, within which the formation of another sprout\nis not allowed (i.e. if there is another sprout nearby, Psprout = 0). In practice,\nlateral inhibition via Delta\u2013Notch signalling is thought to regulate the spacing of\nsprouts\u2014ECs adjacent to those from which sprouts emerge are inhibited from\nsprouting [1,24,44,48].\n\u2013 Sprouts are initially labelled as INACTIVE, and retain this label until they con-\nnect to another sprout or vessel when they become ACTIVE. There is no flow in\nINACTIVE sprouts.\n\u2013 Each sprout is created with AGE = 0 and this is incremented by \u2206t at each time\nstep.\n\u2013 The tip of each sprout performs a random walk, biased towards regions of high\nVEGF concentration. The model for cell movement extends that used in [14] where\ncell movement is stochastic and the transition probabilities depend on the numbers\nof cells in a compartment and adjacent compartments. Here we add a dependence\non the VEGF gradient between sites. If Nm is the carrying capacity for movement\nof the cell type attempting to move, Ni is the number of cells and Vi is the VEGF\nlevel at site i , \u03b3 is the chemotactic sensitivity, and \u2126i is the set of sites in a\nneighbourhood of i , not including i itself, then we define Pi j , the probability of\nmoving from i to j in time \u2206t , to be\nPi j = \u2206t Dd2i j\u2206x2\n(Nm \u2212 N j )\u2211\nk\u2208\u2126i (Nm \u2212 Nk) + Nm \u2212 Ni + Nm M\n(\n1 + \u03b3 Vj \u2212 Vi\ndi j\u2206x\n)\nfor i \u0004= j, (8)\nwhere di j is the distance in units of \u2206x between sites i and j (and hence is either 1\nor\n\u221a\n2) and D is the maximum cell mobility in the absence of chemotaxis. Individual\nmovement probabilities are weighted according to the relative distance moved (this\nscaling was not used in [14]). The probability of not moving is\nPii = 1 \u2212\n\u2211\nk\u2208\u2126i\nPik = 1 \u2212 \u2206t D\n\u2206x2\n\u2211\nk\u2208\u2126i\nNm\u2212Nk\nd2ik\n(\n1 + \u03b3 Vk\u2212Vidik\u2206x\n)\n\u2211\nk\u2208\u2126i (Nm \u2212 Nk) + Nm \u2212 Ni + Nm M\n.\nIn the limit as Nm \u2192 \u221e, the mean waiting time is\n\u2206t\n\u239b\n\u239d\u2211\nk\u2208\u2126i\nPik\n\u239e\n\u23a0\n\u22121\n= \u2206x\n2\nD\n9 + M\n2(2 + \u221a2) + \u2211k\u2208\u2126i \u03b3 Vk\u2212Vid3ik\u2206x\n.\n123\nAngiogenesis and vascular remodelling in normal and cancerous tissues 699\nThis is a decreasing (increasing) function of \u03b3 for \u2211k\u2208\u2126i (Vk \u2212 Vi )\/(d3ik\u2206x) >\n0 (< 0) which reflects movement up VEGF gradients. It is also clear that the\nparameter M measures the tendency of a cell to stay put\u2014as M increases the\nmean waiting time increases. A similar relationship holds for the mean waiting\ntime for finite Nm , but we omit it here.\n\u2013 Diagonal tip cell movement is allowed, except when it would cause one sprout to\ncross a vessel or another sprout.\n\u2013 In each lattice site visited by the tip, an endothelial cell is created that remains there\nwithout moving (this is similar to the \u201csnail trail\u201d used by other authors [7,47]).\n\u2013 A tip cell establishes a connection by moving to a lattice site also occupied by a\nsprout (possibly itself) or by a vessel.\n\u2013 If a sprout does not connect within a given period of time then the sprout dies and is\nremoved. This rule is based on the fact that ECs depend upon flow-induced signals\nfor survival [42]. As blunt-ended sprouts are not circulated, ECs in unconnected\nsprouts do not receive these signals. We assume that the maximum time span ECs\ncan survive without these signals is the same as the time, Tprune, that established\nvessels can survive with low WSS. Note that we consider a single age for the whole\nsprout, but this could be relaxed in combination with a more detailed model for\nendothelial cell proliferation behind a tip cell.\n\u2013 Connected sprouts are re-labelled as ACTIVE and added to the vascular network,\nwith each endothelial cell in a sprout contributing a vessel segment.\n\u2013 The new vascular network is used to update the blood flow and haematocrit distrib-\nution. Since pruning due to low WSS applies to individual vessel segments, single\nsegments in a new angiogenic vessel (or in any path between bifurcating nodes)\ncould be pruned. However, as noted in Sect. 2.1, the rest of any resulting blunt-\nended path will be removed later, unless flow is again established by a subsequent\nnew connection.\nWe remark that our approach to tip cell movement is similar to the approaches\nof Anderson et al. [7] and Plank and Sleeman [39], except that we allow diagonal\nmovement. Anderson et al. [7] consider transition probabilities based upon a discreti-\nsation of partial differential equations for random motion, chemotaxis and haptotaxis,\nwhereas Plank and Sleeman utilise an approach of Othmer and Stevens [35] with\nconstant mean waiting time. In contrast, our transition probabilities also take account\nof the space available in neighbouring lattice sites, and give a mean waiting time\nthat depends on VEGF gradients. An alternative is to consider a lattice-free approach\n[38,47].\n3 Vascular adaptation in healthy tissue\nHere we explore the consequences of vessel pruning and angiogenesis in normal tis-\nsue. For clarity, throughout this section we neglect VEGF-induced vessel dilation (as\nintroduced in [4]). We also postpone exploration of the role of asymmetric haematocrit\nsplitting until the discussion, assuming instead that the haematocrit splits symmetri-\ncally at bifurcations.\n123\n700 M. R. Owen et al.\nFor all simulations we consider a tissue domain of 50 \u00d7 50 cellular automaton\nlocations, with a grid spacing \u2206x = 40 \u00b5m. Thus we assume that cells are not\nparticularly closely packed, and the tissue is 2 mm square. Simulation time is presented\nin days, with a time step between automata updates of \u2206t = 30 min. The basic\nparameter set for all simulations is given in Tables 1, 2, 3, 4 in Appendix B.\n3.1 Vessel pruning due to low wall shear stress\nAs outlined above, low wall shear stress is thought to be a principal mechanism behind\nvessel regression [19,34,42]. Here we consider a situation where a vascular bed has\nbeen established, and we examine the consequences of subsequent pruning. This could\nmimic a situation of wound healing or vasculogenesis, in which the network forms\nprior to remodelling. Alternatively, it could represent situations such as occlusion of\nan upstream feeding vessel, a reduction in blood pressure, or the application of a\nvasodilator. Figure 2 shows how as the pressure drop across a network is reduced,\nmore vessels are pruned due to low wall shear stress. In each case the initial flow\npattern gives rise to higher wall shear stress in paths that lead from the inflow (bottom\nleft) to the outflow (top right), with low levels of wall shear stress in segments that run\nin the approximately perpendicular direction (i.e. those segments that couple nodes\nwith almost equal pressures). In addition, the most peripheral parts of the network (in\nterms of distance from the inflow or outflow) also experience the lowest wall shear\nstress.\n3.2 Angiogenesis\nWe begin by considering a situation in which a population of normal cells is initially\nunder-vascularised, with hypoxia in the gap between two parallel parent vessels.\nFigure 3 shows how initially the normal cells die in the most hypoxic region, whilst\nthose that survive secrete VEGF which stimulates angiogenic sprouting. Many sprouts\nfail to connect before dying, or experience insufficient wall shear stress for survival,\nbut gradually new functional connections form and are maintained until the simulated\ntissue becomes well vascularised and VEGF levels fall. At larger times (not shown)\nVEGF levels fall to zero everywhere and angiogenesis ceases.\nWe expect that blood oxygenation should affect the vascular density that develops.\nFor lower levels of oxygen release from the blood we would expect to see hypoxia\nand VEGF levels remain high for longer, and hence more angiogenesis and a higher\nfinal vascular density. Figure 4 shows the time evolution, averaged over five stochastic\nrealisations, of vascular density and VEGF for varying oxygen release. In the case\nof lower oxygen release we see that a higher vascular density develops in order to\ncompensate for the reduced ability of each vessel to supply oxygen.\nIt is interesting to assess whether we reach a similar endpoint (in terms of average\nvascular density) if we use different initial vessel configurations. For example, we ran\nsimulations with 1, 2, 3 or 4 equally spaced initial parent vessels, all running from the\nleft to right edge of the domain with the same pressure drop. We found that the long\ntime vascular density is weakly dependent on the initial vascular distribution.

This pressure difference is applied from the bottom left node to the top right node. As the\npressure difference decreases, the number of vessels in which flow is maintained falls. The inflow pressures\nwere a Pin = 24 mmHg, b Pin = 22 mmHg, c Pin = 19 mmHg, with an outflow pressure in each case\nof Pout = 15 mmHg. The thickness of each segment is proportional to the vessel radius calculated using\nEq. (1), and the shading indicates the wall shear stress. Parameter values are as in Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, except\nfor Pmaxsprout = 0 (no angiogenic sprouting) and the inflow pressures indicated above\ninitial vessel the network is still (weakly) stimulated to develop at time 200, whereas\nwith 2\/3\/4 initial vessels by time 200 there is little or no hypoxia\/VEGF production and\nhence little or no further sprouting\/angiogenesis. Since all initial vessels were linear,\nand linear vessels oxygenate a greater area of tissue per unit length than more tortuous\nvessels, we found that with four initial vessels only the top and bottom of the domain\nsee significant angiogenesis, and the tissue reaches a steady vasculature earlier. In\ncontrast, with a single initial vessel by the end of the simulated time a steady state\nis only just being approached. Thus we see an ordering, with the final vessel density\ndecreasing as the initial number of (linear) parent vessels increases from one to four\n(results not shown).\n123\n702 M. R.

Early pruning leaves four main vessel paths from inflow to outflow,\nand remodelling fails to reoxygenate the whole tissue region. In fact, because the new\nvessels stimulated by the initial pruning are more tortuous than those that they replace,\nwe actually find a contraction of the area oxygenated. Consequently we considered\nthe case with a chemotaxis coefficient \u03b3 increased by a factor of ten (Fig. 5b). We\nnow see that remodelling is able to completely supply the tissue region. This process\nrequires the effective replacement of vessels that are not necessary in one region of\ntissue with new vessels in regions that are undersupplied. Thus, new vessels must form\nand be maintained by \u201cstealing\u201d sufficient flow from existing vessels. Figure 6 shows\nthe time course of vessel density and mean VEGF concentration, for \u03b3 = 8 \u00d7 104\nand \u03b3 = 8 \u00d7 105, averaged over 10 simulations in each case. This illustrates how the\nvessel density initially falls (due to pruning) before rising to fluctuate about a mean\nlevel governed by the pressure drop, while the VEGF level reflects the ability of the\nevolving vessel network to oxygenate the tissue.\n123\n704 M.

For\n\u03b3 = 8 \u00d7 104 the mean number of vessels fluctuates around a level sustainable by the pressure difference\nacross the vessel network, whilst the mean VEGF concentration remains high. For \u03b3 = 8\u00d7105 remodelling\nis able to oxygenate more of the tissue, so that, on average, VEGF levels are much smaller.

Figure 7a shows the initial condition, and Fig. 7b shows a simulation\ncorresponding to the case of Fig. 5b. Early in the simulation, normal cells far from\nthe initial parent vessel die due to hypoxia-induced apoptosis, but VEGF production\nstimulates angiogenic sprouting and the whole region is repopulated in a wave-like\nmanner as new vessels connect, allowing normal cells to proliferate and spread, which\nin turn triggers further angiogenesis. Figure 7c shows an example where a lower\ninflow pressure alters this balance in favour of vessel regression. As a result, the\nvessel network cannot extend across the whole region, normal cells cannot survive\nin the hypoxic corners, and hypoxia induced VEGF production is not eliminated.\nFigure 8 shows the time course, averaged over ten realisations in each case, for these\ntwo different inflow pressures. For the larger pressure drop, VEGF levels initially rise\nsharply, before declining as vascularisation progresses (which is marked by the number\nof vessels rising and then levelling off). For the lower pressure drop, the vessel number\napproaches a lower level, whilst VEGF levels remain high, reflecting the dominance\nof vessel pruning and consequent sustained hypoxia.\n123\n706 M. R.

As in Fig. 6 we show a moving average for clarity (with a window size of 10 time units)\n4 Vascular tumour growth\nWe first compare simulations of tumour growth in the absence of angiogenesis, with\nVEGF-induced vessel dilation as outlined previously [4], and with explicit angiogen-\nesis as introduced here. Figure 9a shows an initial condition with a clone of tumour\ncells implanted in a tissue with an initially hexagonal vascular network. The cancer\ncells invade the normal cell population since they have a proliferative advantage, con-\nsume more oxygen, and can lower the normal cells\u2019 p53 threshold for apoptosis (see\nEqs. (16) and (17) in Appendix A.2). Figure 9b shows the long term behaviour with\nno vessel dilation or angiogenesis, and Fig. 9c shows the case with implicit angio-\ngenesis via VEGF-induced vessel dilation. In each case hypoxic and necrotic regions\ndevelop at the centre of each hexagon, with vessel dilation simply making these regions\nsmaller, since each dilated vessel supplies more oxygen to the tissue. With explicit\nangiogenesis (Fig. 9d), the VEGF produced by quiescent tumour cells leads to angio-\ngenic sprouting and the formation of new functional vessels, and the tumour is able\nto spread throughout the domain.\nWe now embed a tumour in normal tissue with two linear vessels. Figure 10 shows\nthat, given this relatively sparse initial vessel network, the tumour remains confined\n123\n708 M. R.

This can lead to periods of relative\nstagnation followed by sudden expansions in tumour size (the number of tumour cells\nrises steeply around t = 30). In contrast, if we first allow the normal vessel network\nto develop via angiogenesis (and hence use the final network from the simulation of\nFig. 3 as our new initial condition), the tumour spreads more rapidly, exploiting the\nrelatively dense initial vasculature and adding to it where hypoxia arises. Figure 11\nshows an example simulation, and Fig. 12 shows the time courses (averaged over five\nrealisations) of the numbers of tumour cells and vessels. Although the initial tumour\ngrowth is more rapid, the long-term tumour size and vascular density are the same (on\naverage) with and without a dense initial vascular network. In addition, the long-term\nvascular density with a tumour is significantly higher than that without a tumour, due\nto the cancer cells\u2019 higher oxygen consumption rate.\n5 Discussion\nWe have incorporated angiogenesis and vascular remodelling within a previously\ndeveloped multiscale model for vascular tissue growth [2,4,5,14]. We include two\nfundamental mechanisms of vascular development and homeostasis, (1) by explic-\nitly accounting for the pruning of vessels that have insufficient flow for a sustained\nperiod of time, and (2) via VEGF-dependent formation of angiogenic sprouts and the\nconsequent creation of new vessel connections that establish blood flow. These two\nmechanisms provide the ability to generate new vasculature to supply regions with\ntoo low a vascular density, and to eliminate vessels that do not sustain flow.\nWe found that vessel pruning is principally determined by the pressure drop across\nthe vascular network, with a smaller drop leading to more pruning (see Fig. 2). This\nis similar to the emergence of a dilated backbone in the work of McDougall and\nco-workers [33], except that here even large vessels can be pruned if their wall shear\nstress falls. With angiogenesis, the level of blood oxygenation regulates the extent\nof angiogenesis and the mean long term vascular density, with higher oxygenation\nleading to fewer vessels. We also found that the initial vasculature can affect the final\nvascular density, particularly when the pressure drop across the network is high enough\nto support low levels of vessel pruning. Combining these insights, simulations show\nthat network remodelling is best achieved via an appropriate balance between pruning\nand angiogenesis. It is also important that the chemotactic bias in sprout migration\nis sufficiently strong to form vessels that are not too tortuous (Figs. 5, 6). The fluid\nflow calculations do not explicitly include any notion of tortuosity, but given two\nconnections, with the same start and end points, the same radii and an equal pressure\ndrop, the longer connection (and hence typically more tortuous) will have the lower\nwall shear stress and hence is more likely to be pruned (this argument does not take into\naccount the effect of curvature on wall shear stress). This dependence on the strength of\nchemotaxis raises an interesting question as to whether the trend persists, or whether\na sufficiently strong chemotactic bias could in fact be detrimental (for example by\noverextending new vessels, which could again give lower wall shear stress).\n123\n710 M.

Notice how the tumour remains confined close to the upper vessel until connections are made\nthat allow it to spread fully into the lower half of the domain. Also worth noting is that tumour cells\u2019\nincreased oxygen consumption triggers VEGF expression by more normal cells as well, since they also\nexperience resultant low oxygen levels.

(Dash-dot) For reference we show the evolution of the number of vessels in the absence of tumour\ncells (the same as the solid curve of Fig. 4). This illustrates how the greater nutrient consumption of tumour\ncells stimulates a higher vascular density. Each curve is the mean of five simulations. Parameter values are\nas in Tables 1, 2, 3, 4\nsufficiently sparse, the tumour can remain confined close to a single parent vessel\n(analogous to tumour cords [13]) until new vessels bridge the gap to another nearby\nparent vessel. This can lead to periods of relative stagnation followed by sudden\nexpansions in tumour size (Fig. 10). Bartha and Rieger [11] concluded that vascular\ndensity might not be an appropriate indicator of tumour prognosis, as is generally\nbelieved. Instead, their model suggests that tumour progression, at least in its early\nstages, is strongly determined by the vascular density of the original host tissue. This\nis supported by our simulations of tumour growth, which also indicate that host tissues\nof low vascular density give rise to tumour expansion which is limited by the time\ntaken to co-opt the host vasculature.\nUp to now we have concentrated on the case without asymmetric haematocrit\nsplitting at bifurcations in order to focus on the dynamics of vessel pruning and angio-\ngenesis. We expect that haematocrit splitting will alter the details in any particular\ncase but that it will not significantly alter the qualitative and time-averaged behaviour.\nWhen haematocrit splitting according to Yen and Fung [54] is included, we see that\nthe overall dynamics is very similar (results not shown). Inhomogeneous haematocrit\n123\nAngiogenesis and vascular remodelling in normal and cancerous tissues 713\ndistributions may affect local flow patterns, leading to a variation in precisely which\nvessels are pruned due to low wall shear stress. We found that the vessel pruning\nsimulations of Fig. 2 (where the inflow pressure was varied) showed no difference\nin the vessels pruned or the final vessel structure. VEGF induced vessel dilation was\nfound to be a stronger factor, leading to the deletion of extra vessels, because dilated\nvessels typically have lower wall shear stress. As another example we revisited the\nsimulations from Sect. 3.2. We found that asymmetric haematocrit splitting makes\nlittle qualitative difference to the vasculature that develops, and that the dynamics\nand vessel densities reached are very similar with or without asymmetric haematocrit\nsplitting (results not shown).\nThe multiscale model developed here has diverse applications including to normal\nvascular development, tumour growth, and wound healing. There are almost innumer-\nable possible directions for future work, ranging from the inclusion of more detail at\nthe subcellular level to the incorporation of additional cell types such as macrophages.\nExtravasation of other cell types is a straightforward modification of the rules for\nendothelial tip cell sprouting, so we can now use our model to study issues such\nas drug delivery using engineered macrophages [36] (which can migrate chemotac-\ntically using the formalism of Eq. 8), invasion [6], or even intravasation of tumour\ncells and metastasis. We have not so far discussed interactions with the extracellular\nmatrix (ECM), although this is an important ingredient in the angiogenesis mod-\nels of Anderson and coworkers [7,18], which include haptotaxis, the directed move-\nment of cells in response to gradients in ECM density. In the context of the model\ndescribed here, it seems likely that including ECM degradation and haptotaxis may\npromote the formation of less tortuous vessels by reinforcing the direction of tip cell\nmovement.\nOther important features to include will be the explicit proliferation of endothe-\nlial cells behind the moving tip cell, and modelling of tip cell selection based on\nthe lateral-inhibition process outlined in [24,44,48]. Interestingly, Bentley et al. [12]\nhave recently developed an agent-based computational model for Notch-mediated tip\ncell selection. Partial differential equation modelling has also been used to address\nthe initiation of angiogenic sprouting, although not specifically tip cell selection\n[29,30]. The angiopoietins also represent an important class of signals involved in\nvessel maturation and competence for angiogenesis. Further avenues for future inves-\ntigation include the impact of therapy on vascular tumour growth using different drugs\nand different protocols, particularly to compare the impact of anti-vascular drugs that\ntarget functional vasculature (causing vessel collapse) with those that target prolifer-\nating endothelial cells.\nAcknowledgments MRO acknowledges the support of the BBSRC (E18413) and thanks the EPRSC\nfor financial support for the Interdisciplinary Angiogenesis Network (ANGIONET, EP\/D501083\/1,\nhttp:\/\/www.maths.nottingham.ac.uk\/angionet\/).

The reader is\nreferred to reference [4] for a fully detailed account. The cell cycle model, introduced\nin [3] as an extension of the Tyson-Novak framework [51], accounts for the effects of\nhypoxia via the modulation of p27 degradation. The model consists of five ordinary\ndifferential equations for the cell mass and the proteins Cdh1, cycCDK, p27 and npRB.\nd[Cdh1]\ndt\n= (1 + b3[npRB])(1 \u2212 [Cdh1])\nJ3 + 1 \u2212 [Cdh1] \u2212\nb4 M[cycC DK ][Cdh1]\nJ4 + [Cdh1] (9)\nd[cycC DK ]\ndt\n= a4 \u2212 (a1 + a2[Cdh1] + a3[p27])[cycC DK ] (10)\nd M\ndt\n= \u03b7M\n(\n1 \u2212 M\nM\u2217\n)\n(11)\nd[p27]\ndt\n= c1\n(\n1 \u2212 \u03c7 M\nM\u2217\n)\n\u2212 c2C(x)\nB + C(x) [p27] (12)\nd[npRB]\ndt\n= d2 \u2212 (d2 + d1[cycC DK ])[npRB] (13)\n123\nAngiogenesis and vascular remodelling in normal and cancerous tissues 715\nThe parameters are given in Table 1, except for those that differ between normal and\ncancer cells, which can be found in Table 2. For example, normal cells produce p27\nat rate modulated by their mass, whereas cancer cells are assumed to produce p27 at\na constant rate. This is reflected in the values of \u03c7 in Table 2. Also notice that the rate\nof p27 degradation, and hence the speed of the cell cycle, is an increasing function of\noxygen, C(x) [3].\nThe evolution of the concentrations of p53 and VEGF within a given cell are\nmodulated by oxygen in the following manner:\nd[p53]\ndt\n= k7 \u2212 k \u20327\nC(x)\nC p53 + C(x) [p53] (14)\nd[VEGF]\ndt\n= k8 + k \u2032\u20328\n[p53][VEGF]\nJ5 + [VEGF] \u2212 k\n\u2032\n8\nC(x)\nCVEGF + C(x) [VEGF]. (15)\nHere, k \u2032\u20328 is positive for tumour cells (p53 increases VEGF production in cancer cells),\nbut negative in normal cells (p53 decreases VEGF production in normal cells). Oxygen\npromotes p53 and VEGF degradation, and their expression therefore increases under\nhypoxia. For details of the experimental evidence supporting these forms we refer the\nreader to [4].\nInitial conditions for the above differential equations, which are set when a cell is\nfirst created, are given by the relevant variable with a subscript zero in Table 1.\nA.2 Cellular level\nCells attempt to divide when [Cdh1] < Cdh1THR and [cycC DK ] > cycC DKTHR.\nA daughter cell is placed in the current location i if the number of cells there is less\nthat the carrying capacity for division (i.e. if Ni < Dm). Otherwise, a daughter cell is\nplaced in the neighbouring empty location with the highest oxygen concentration. If\nneither of these is possible, the parent cell dies. After successful division the parent cell\nmass is halved and its p27 level is reset to [p27]0, and the daughter cell is initialised\nas above.\nNormal cell apoptosis occurs when [p53] > p53THR, where the threshold depends\non the local ratio of normal cells to normal and cancer cells, \u03c1normal:\np53THR =\n\u23a7\u23a8\n\u23a9\np53highTHR for \u03c1normal > \u03c1THR\np53lowTHR for \u03c1normal \u2264 \u03c1THR\n.

Thus,\n123\n716 M. R. Owen et al.\nnormal cells are more likely to undergo apoptosis when sharing a site with or sur-\nrounded by cancer cells. This, and competition for nutrient, is a key mechanism for\ninvasion.\nCancer cells enter (leave) quiescence when [p27] > p27e ([p27] < p27l ). Upon\nentering quiescence a timer Tquiescent is set to zero and subsequently is incremented\nfor each time step that the cell remains quiescent. Cancer cell apoptosis occurs when\na cancer cell is quiescent for too long (i.e. when Tquiescent \u2265 Tdeath).\nA.3 Vascular flow and adaptation\nThe flow in each vessel, indexed by i , is assumed to be laminar steady Poiseuille flow,\ni.e.\nQ\u02d9i = \u03c0 R\n4\ni\n8\u00b5(Ri , Hi )Li\n\u2206Pi , (18)\nwhere Q\u02d9i is the flow rate in vessel i , \u2206Pi is the pressure difference, and \u00b5(Ri , Hi ) =\n\u00b50\u00b5rel(Ri , Hi ) is a haematocrit and radius dependent blood viscosity [40], where \u00b50\nis the plasma viscosity and\n\u00b50.45(R) = 6e\u22120.17R + 3.2 \u2212 2.44e\u22120.06(2R)0.645 (19)\nC(R) =\n(\n0.8 + e\u22120.15R\n)(\n\u22121 + 1\n1 + 10\u221211(2R)12\n)\n+ 1\n1 + 10\u221211(2R)12\n(20)\n\u00b5rel(R, H) =\n[\n1 + (\u00b50.45(R) \u2212 1) (1 \u2212 H)\nC \u2212 1\n(1 \u2212 0.45)C \u2212 1\n(\n2R\n2R \u2212 1.1\n)2]( 2R\n2R \u2212 1.1\n)2\n.\n(21)\nAt each node, except for inflows and outflows, conservation of mass means that the\ntotal flow into and out of each node must balance. Using Eq. (18) to write those flows\nin terms of pressures, together with specified inflow and outflow pressures (Pin and\nPout), yields a set of linear equations for the pressures at each node. Given the nodal\npressures, Eq. (18) is used to calculate the flow in each vessel segment.\nGiven the flows Q\u02d9i and vessel radii Ri , the inflow haematocrit, Hin can be prop-\nagated through the vessel network. Asymmetric haematocrit splitting can be imple-\nmented as described in [14], where the degree of asymmetry is parameterised by \u03b1.\nHowever, as noted in Sect. 2.1, we assume symmetric splitting in this paper (by setting\n\u03b1 = 0) in order to focus on the dynamics of pruning and angiogenesis.\nUpdated haematocrit values can then be fed into the calculation of vessel radii\nadaptation defined by Eqs. (1)\u2013(4), where the WSS set point is given by\n\u03c4(P) = 100 \u2212 86 exp\n(\n\u22125000 [log(log P)]5.4) . (22)\n123\nAngiogenesis and vascular remodelling in normal and cancerous tissues 717\nThe new vessel radii and haematocrit values will modify the flow calculation, so the\nsequence (calculate flow, haematocrit and radii) is iterated, with time step \u03b5t , until the\nmaximum proportional change in vessel radius across the network is less than Rreltol.\nThe default parameter set for the vasculature is given in Table 3.\nAppendix B: Parameter values\nHere we list all the parameter values for the simulations of Figs. 3 and 5a. All other\nfigures use the same parameter set except for variations in initial vessel and\/or cell con-\nfigurations, maximum sprouting probability Pmaxsprout, oxygen permeability Pc, chemo-\ntactic sensitivity \u03b3 , and VEGF induced vessel dilation kVm .
