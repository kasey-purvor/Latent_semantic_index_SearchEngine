Nada \nKakabadse and Andrew Kakabadse contextualise.  \n \nThe shift from physical capital to the softer models of capital \u2013 such \nas social and human capital \u2013 has led to the emergence of network-\nbased organisations.  In these organisations the emphasis is on a \ngroup-based view of leadership rather than a single person clearly \nhighlighting the path forward. Understanding and being responsive to \nmultiple stakeholders in their context is now the leader\u2019s prime \nconcern.   \n \nEffectively addressing multiple stakeholders means recognising and \nresponding to multiple agendas.  Negotiating paths through a \nmultiplicity of issues and circumstances is near impossible for a single \nindividual.   As a result, network-based organisations, by their very \nconfiguration and purpose, require more leaders.  The neat coupling \nof more issues to address and a greater number of actors to address \nthem means that choice is ever more important in leadership roles.  \nThe new generation of leaders are required to extensively exercise \ndiscretion to address the issues they face. \n \nIn practice, discretionary leadership means that the leader shapes \nthe role and determines its more intricate nature. Discretionary roles \nvary according to the degrees of freedom they offer their \nincumbents.  Certain roles will only allow for changes to the \nconfiguration of particular jobs, whereas ultimate discretion aims to \nmake a profound impact on the strategic future of the enterprise. \n \nA role with clearly assigned parameters is one where the incumbent \nis assigned resources and given the specific brief to pursue particular \ncourses of action (prescribed).  The limited freedom of the role \nholder requires the person to leverage existing resources, irrespective \nof whether those resources are considered adequate to do the job.  \nThe role holder may even be directed to act in a manner considered \nsuitable to achieve the goals of the task, team, department or \norganisation.  Roles with broader discretion require the role holder to \n 1\nestablish the parameters of the role, the direction they are to pursue \nand to be responsive to the circumstances they face.   \n \nUltimately, discretionary roles are those positions for which \norganisationally beneficial behaviours and gestures can neither be \nenforced on the basis of formal role obligation nor elicited by \ncontractual guarantee or reward.  In response to the pace and \npressure of organisational change, the nature of discretionary \nboundaries is increasingly determined by personal views, concerning \nthe challenges leaders face and the nature of those with whom they \ninteract.  The idiosyncratic nature of the organisation, the \npeculiarities of each leadership role and the characteristics of the \nindividual, are critical considerations in determining role boundaries \nand parameters. \n \nIndeed, making such a distinction illustrates that those with a \nbroader role remit are in a position to substantially influence their \nsituation.  Further, the number of discretionary roles that exist in an \norganisation determines the number of visions and ways of operating \nthat can shape, positively or negatively, the future of the enterprise.  \nThe greater the number of discretionary roles, the greater the \nnumber of visions that can be pursued and the greater the leadership \nchallenge. \n \nAccordingly, leaders exercising their discretion are required to \nperpetually, deliberately and reflexively consider the nature of the \nlinkages that connects their every action.  Leadership is not just \nconcerned with the exercise of control and co-ordination in the \npursuit of a particular direction, but also with a sensitive \nunderstanding of the context in which actions are exercised and the \nappropriate mobilisation of others, in essence, the generation of \nsocial capital.  Through so doing, the shape of organisations, \nsupported by technological systems are increasingly designed around \nintellectual flows rather than configurations of command, where \nperformance measures and incentive systems reward individuals for \nthe creation of value.   \n \n 2\nFor the flatter, more network-based organisation, which, by nature, \nhouses a greater number of discretionary roles, the need to promote \npositive interdependency, is paramount.  Responding to multiple \nstakeholders\u2019 requirements obviates identifying the one best way to \nmanage.  Only through nurturing a shared value system are the \ntensions inherent in the network-based enterprise minimised and that \nenergy focused towards achieving positive ends. \n \nHowever, where discretionary role analysis highlights variation of \nexperience, capability, values, personality, behaviours and the \nexercise of choice amongst the leaders of the organisation, tension \nand conflict become endemic with potentially disastrous \nconsequences for individuals and the organisation.  Where \ncontinuous tension and an evolving but negatively inclined \norganisational landscape become the norm, leaders, particularly \nwithin network-based organisations, require an overarching analytical \nperspective that can comprehend the totality of the state of the \norganisation and yet, simultaneously, understand the nature of each \ninteraction within the enterprise.  A first step towards such \nenlightenment is to appreciate the level of migration from the \ncontrol\/transactional model of leadership to that of discretionary \nleadership which can induce a transformational impact (Table 1). \n \nAs the effectiveness of organisational performance considerably rests \non the quality of interactions, communication and co-ordination \nbetween stakeholders, leaders will be challenged to share their \nleadership and, as a result, will need to enhance their maturity in \norder to effectively share authority and responsibility across the \nleadership cadre.   Ever greater innovation in ICT and the growing \nglobalisation of trade will further induce the proliferation of \nnetworked organisations of alliances, emphasising joint ventures \nbased on collaboration and dependent on situational authority.  The \nnew-age-capabilities of pursuing multiple dialogues simultaneously, \nnamely, polylogues and co-creating value, are posited as becoming \nfundamental elements of organisational functioning. \n \nShifting mindsets \n \n 3\nThe switch from the charismatic leader model of communication \u2013 \nfocused on selling a vision and getting buy-in from followers -- to \nthat of discretionary leadership which aims to influence the mindset \nof others in the network and shift towards a shared philosophy, \nrequires movement from singularly created meanings to co-created \nmeanings (Table 2). The leader needs to be an active listener in \norder to gain the necessary understanding of follower needs and use \nthat insight to shape the vision in a fashion that appeals and inspires \nfollowers. \n \nSuch bonding and bridging of social capital in order to promote a \nshared philosophy, not only depends on the leaders\u2019 cognitive phenol \ntype but also on the social time devoted to addressing the formal and \ntacit relational dimensions within the organisation.  Open information \norganisations are characterised by lateral and horizontal patterns of \nexchange, interdependent flows of resources and reciprocal lines of \ncommunications.  The diverse interests and priorities of varying \nstakeholders requires the discretionary leader to navigate through a \nmultiplicity of interests, identifying shared commonalities and \nensuring that benefit is derived from participation.  Dialogue, a form \nof communication between two actors, is insufficient when sense \nmaking conversations are simultaneously required across multiple \nactors.  Thus, dialogue is substituted by polylogue or multilogue. \n \nWithin polylogue communication, conversations abound, at times \nbeing experienced as productive and other times, being viewed as \nrepetitive and fruitless.  Emotionally and contextually driven \nconversations require reinforcement, often involving repetition of the \nsame conversation, as much to help individuals face their challenges \nas to provide them with insights to better enable them to move \nforward.  Providing support, displaying empathy to others, making \nallowance for people to express their frustrations and going over the \nsame issues to that each individual can gain a greater understanding \nof the issues facing them, can be perceived as pointless repetition.  \nReinforcing messages can also, unfortunately, lead to unproductive \nrepetition.  However, through greater intimacy of appreciation of \neach stakeholder and by judging the degree to which a new \n 4\nconvergence of opinion emerges, a breakthrough in terms of mindset \nshift can be achieved. \n \nAs polylogue requires ceaseless conversations, negotiations, \ncompromise, mutual exploration and inquiry, where the range of \nparticipants encompassed not only covers the trusted, but also \n\u201cstrange and alien voices\u201d, it is critical to also achieve closure on \ndiscussions through establishing a new platform of awareness \nreinforcing the changed mindset.  The challenge of achieving closure \nis clearly identified by Cary Cooper who remarks \u201cinclusive doesn\u2019t \nmean being touchy feely\u201d and continues that shared and inclusive \nleadership equally has little to do with popularity. \n \nOnce established, the philosophical platform enables integration of \ncontrasting perspectives, such as, concern for others (people), \neconomic efficiency (profit), environmental care (planet) and \nestablishing an environment conducive for future generations \n(posterity).  The discretionary leader\u2019s challenge is to promote a \npolylogue environment by providing intellectual as well as process \ncontributions.  Teams become as much units of action as learning \ngroups, whereby, reflection on experience and learning, combined \nwith action, are accepted as an everyday norm.  Adopting a \npolylogue mindset better enables the community to address and \ndiscuss the undiscussable issues that require open examination.  \nThus, the discretionary leader promotes a value trajectory, in which \nparticipatory methods used for debate and procedures and tools for \nguiding debate, form as much the leadership kitbag of skills as do \nfiduciary and accountability mechanisms, a point supported by \nresearch examining policy application effectiveness in government \nwhich concludes that leadership has to be considered as a pluralist \nactivity and not an individual cluster of qualities and requirements. \n \nThe responsibility \n \nIndividuals who find themselves in a leadership position bear \nresponsibility for the moral state of their constituency.  Such \nresponsibility does not solely require establishing the leader\u2019s values.  \nMoral effectiveness requires balancing and, if possible, integrating the \n 5\nconstituent members\u2019 desires and perspectives, and emerging with a \ncollective sense of moral integrity and responsibility.  Such \nconsiderations are particularly critical in today\u2019s complex \norganisations where leadership is shared.  Certain individuals \npromote leadership from the centre, others hold leadership \nresponsibility on a country or regional basis, still others on a \nfunctional\/professional basis and yet others have a line of business or \nproduct or service responsibility.  Simply because leadership \nresponsibilities and accountabilities are shared does not mean a \nsharing of philosophy, objectives, attitudes or even mission and \nvision for the organisation.  On the basis that the greater the number \nof leaders potentially the greater dissonance, the requirement for \npolylogue-based communication is heightened. Otherwise the erosion \nand tearing of the social and economic fabric of organisations will \nbecome an everyday experience.  The balance lies between desire \nand a personal sense of responsibility; between the demands of \neconomies of scale and the social needs of the community. \n \nResponding to the economic realities confronting leaders, balanced \nagainst providing a sense of care for the community are paradoxes \nthat any one individual would be unduly challenged to reconcile.  \nThus, the need for the discretionary leader to co-create futures with \nothers, through involvement and continuous examination of ways \nforward, balancing short-term, operational demands captured in the \naccountabilities that confront each leader against attending to the \nsustainable development of the enterprise.  Thus, the philosophy of \nshareholder wealth is impregnated by the philosophy of stakeholder \ndevelopment.  Polylogue, the desired philosophy of communication \nunderpinning discretionary leadership, requires the suspension of \njudgement until the other\u2019s point of view has been examined and \nreflection over one\u2019s own practice has been undertaken.  \nDiscretionary leadership adopts the Socrates perspective of the \nexamined life - \u201can unexamined life is not work having\u201d - and only \nthrough such enrichment, can all jointly progress beyond \nleader\/follower and shareholder wealth, to shared responsibility and \nenterprise and community sustainability. \n \nResources \n 6\nBass, B.
