How do you feel about mathematics ?\nAnswer. Maths is the demon that jumped out of the closet and licked me in \nthe face. \n[Third-year student, currently training to be a primary teacher]\nD\nemons are abhorrent creatures. They instil fear and are best avoided. Yet\nmathematics as a demon has managed to \u2018lick\u2019 this student. Does this\nimply that the demon has been tamed and that some kind of affection lies\nbetween the student and the subject? Has the student\u2019s own fear of the\nsubject been licked? If it has, how were the transitions between fear and\nfriendliness, abhorrence and affection, made? \nMany transitions are potentially problematic. But for students entering\ninitial training as primary teachers, who so often perceive mathematics as a\nsource of anxiety, the movement between the two locations of learner and\nteacher seems especially fraught. This exploratory article marks an attempt\nat having some appreciation of the various kinds of \u2018self work\u2019 (Stronach and\nMaclure, 1997, p. 135) that is undertaken by students when making the\nmove from being a \u2018learner of mathematics\u2019 to becoming a \u2018teacher of math-\nematics\u2019. We suggest that for such students \u2018identity\u2019 can be seen as a key\nfeature in easing those tensions which lie between the two sites. Sub-\nsequently we try to show how particular constructions of the \u2018self\u2019 are used\nto surmount and negotiate hurdles and boundaries. This includes perceived\nlack of mathematical competence. Our main interest, then, is perceptions of\nthe \u2018self\u2019 and how, in relation to mathematics, it is talked about, described\nand generally theorised. In part, this involves looking at the kinds of emo-\ntional baggage that centre on mathematics and which students have col-\nlected over a period of time. We are particularly interested in those ways\n\u2018identity\u2019 seems to assist in both accruing and jettisoning such baggage. We\nalso note and discuss how accounts of past mathematical experiences are \ufb01l-\ntered through current perceptual frameworks. It is this crisscrossing\nbetween present perceptions of mathematics and the self, memories of\nmathematics and the self, and how together these feed into and help fash-\nion future constructions of the self as \u2018teacher of mathematics\u2019, that we\nattempt to address.\nA\nn\n \ne\nn\nq\nu\ni\nr\ny\n \ni\nn\nt\no\n \nt\nr\na\nn\ns\ni\nt\ni\no\nn\ns\n1\nAn enquiry into transitions\nFrom being a \u2018learner of mathematics\u2019 to becoming a\n\u2018teacher of mathematics\u2019\nLiz Jones Manchester Metropolitan University\nTony Brown Manchester Metropolitan University\nUna Hanley Manchester Metropolitan University\nOlwen McNamara Manchester Metropolitan UniversityIn exploring the uneven territory between being a \u2018learner of mathemat-\nics\u2019 and being a \u2018teacher of mathematics\u2019 this article offers a series of inter-\npretations based on interview transcripts. These interpretations are personal\nreadings and cannot be considered \u2018hard-edged analyses\u2019 or indeed \u2018author-\nitative accounts\u2019. Despite that, however, we believe that the readings take\ntentative steps in increasing our understanding of \u2018transitions\u2019. \nWe begin by situating this study in relation to some existing work on stu-\ndent transitions. There follows a more detailed account of how we perceive\n\u2018identity\u2019. Finally readings based on interview transcripts are offered. Here\nour task is to show how \u2018identity\u2019 becomes a means of reconciling the past\nwith the present and the future. Our suggestion is that, because certain rec-\nonciliations have been effected, transition between the two sites of learner\nand teacher becomes possible. \n\u2018Transition\u2019: what the papers say \nResearch into student transitions can be roughly grouped into two domains,\ncognitive and affective. In recent years the \ufb01rst arm of this body of literature\nseems to have taken its lead from Shulman (1987) with the focus on Peda-\ngogical Content Knowledge (Wilson et al., 1987; Livingston and\nBorko,1990; Ball, 1991). Here consolidating and acquiring knowledge and\nexpertise are perceived as a way of moving from the location of learner to\nthat of teacher. Ball (1988, p. 12), for example, believes that a \u2018knowledge\nof mathematics is obviously fundamental to being able to help someone else\nlearn it\u2019. Research into the affective domain meanwhile spans both sociolog-\nical and phenomenological perspectives. Lortie (1975), for example, who is\nguided by the former, suggests that student teachers, when at school, have\nspent time in an \u2018apprenticeship of observation\u2019. That is, as school pupils they\nhave absorbed a range of values, outlooks, practices and processes which\nwork at fashioning perceptions of teacherhood. This point is extended fur-\nther by Zeichner et al. (1987), who suggest that students\u2019 general philoso-\nphies concerning teaching showed very little sign of change as a consequence\nof professional training. Similarly, Harel (1994) notes that notions con-\ncerned with teaching, particularly the teaching of mathematics, are tacitly\nformed by the way students have been taught the subject, prior to college.\nHowever, Su\u2019s (1992) research highlights the general in\ufb02uence of school-\nbased experience when training to be a teacher. More speci\ufb01cally, however,\nit is the \u2018pupils\u2019 reactions, feedback, and performance\u2019 (p. 254) which are\nseen by the student teachers as the most important indicator of their effec-\ntiveness in becoming teachers. Meanwhile other researchers guided by the\nindividual student\u2019s speci\ufb01c perspective (e.g. McNally et al., 1994; Guil-\nlaume and Rudney, 1993) indicate how students will cite comfort in personal\nrelations with both staff and pupils as evidence of their \ufb01nal transition to\nteacher status. \nElsewhere we seek to reconcile the apparent dichotomy between phenom-\nenological and \u2018of\ufb01cial\u2019 perspectives (Brown et al., 1999). In this article,\nR\ne\ns\ne\na\nr\nc\nh\n \ni\nn\n \nE\nd\nu\nc\na\nt\ni\no\nn\nN\no\n.\n \n6\n3\n2however, we shall restrict ourselves to the phenomenological experience of\nstudents seeking to reconcile their personal experience of learning and teach-\ning mathematics with the professional frames they need to inhabit. \nThe study\nIdentity should not be seen as a stable entity \u2013 something that people have\n\u2013 but as something that they use, to justify, explain and make sense of\nthemselves in relation to other people, and to the contexts in which they\noperate. In other words, identity is a form of argument. As such it is both\npractical and theoretical. It is also inescapably moral: identity claims are\ninevitably bound up with justi\ufb01cations of conduct and belief. [Maclure,\n1993a, p. 287, author\u2019s own emphasis]\nThe notion that \u2018identity\u2019 is something people use became a signi\ufb01cant\nresearch theme. Using interview transcripts, drawn from an ESRC project\nentitled \u2018Primary student teachers\u2019 understanding of mathematics and its\nteaching\u2019 (see Brown et al., 1999), the task centred on discerning the ways in\nwhich the students chose to describe themselves. So those ways in which the\n\u2018self\u2019 perceived the world, including certain worries concerned with the\nlearning and teaching of mathematics, became in our view central to how\nsuch concerns were confronted and addressed (Munby, 1986; Schon, 1979).\nTaking note of the \ufb01gurative language that was used by students when talk-\ning about themselves, particularly in relation to mathematics, allowed us\nglimpses into some of their beliefs and orientations about learning and teach-\ning. In some respects the research echoes that of Kagan (1990), who, in seek-\ning to develop alternative ways to evaluate newly quali\ufb01ed teachers\u2019 thinking,\nfocused on their choice of metaphors. These were perceived as re\ufb02ecting how\nthey characterised: \u2018the nature of learning, the teacher\u2019s role in the classroom\nand the goals of education\u2019 (Kagan, 1990, p. 423). In this way beginning\nteachers\u2019 metaphors offered some insights into how they had \ufb01ltered and\nmodi\ufb01ed their university training.\nThe idea of identity as being something that is used as a \u2018form of argument\u2019,\nand which, moreover, could assist in negotiating the boundary between stu-\ndent and learner, became key in the formation of our research focus. As a\nconsequence, particular attention was paid to those parts of the texts in\nwhich the students talked about themselves as \u2018learners of mathematics\u2019 and\nwhere they foresaw themselves being \u2018teachers of mathematics\u2019. The method-\nological framework used when analysing the data is loosely derived from\nconversational analysis and ethnomethodology. Both these approaches,\nwhilst having certain distinct characteristics, nevertheless share the view that\nlanguage, action and knowledge are inseparable (Stubbs, 1983, p. 1). Our\nstudies were not undertaken to \ufb01nd the \u2018true\u2019 identities of the students, nor\nwere they undertaken to \ufb01nd the \u2018truth\u2019 about transition. Rather, our efforts\nwere directed at unearthing the ways in which notions of self get talked about\nand how such notions become the means of negotiating and staking out par-\nticular claims, and become \u2018theorised in discourse\u2019 (Maclure, 1993b, p. 377). \nA\nn\n \ne\nn\nq\nu\ni\nr\ny\n \ni\nn\nt\no\n \nt\nr\na\nn\ns\ni\nt\ni\no\nn\ns\n3Two key focuses emerged from our reading of the transcripts: \ufb01rst, how\nstudents used the past, present and future when accounting for themselves,\nand, secondly, how in describing their past mathematical experiences it\nseemed that negative perceptions of self were resituated as positive traits. The\narticle suggests that, by displacing certain negative perceptions and locating\nthem as a positive term, transitions between the two sites of learner and\nteacher became possible. \nThis article is based on four transcripts which were collected during the\n\ufb01rst round of interviews for the study. Speci\ufb01cally, the body of students that\nthe research focused on were those who were training to be primary teach-\ners and who, as part of their professional brief, would have to teach mathe-\nmatics. Signi\ufb01cantly, whilst all the students that were interviewed held a\nGCSE mathematics quali\ufb01cation, none had pursued mathematics as an A\nlevel subject. Nor had any of the students elected to study mathematics as\neither a \ufb01rst or second subject as part of their university course. The research\nset out to investigate the ways in which such non-specialist students concep-\ntualise mathematics and its teaching and how their views evolve as they\nprogress through an initial course. In all, twenty-seven students were inter-\nviewed and each student was interviewed three times at strategic points dur-\ning the academic year: at the beginning of the year, whilst on school\nexperience and at the end of the year. A particular point was made of inter-\nviewing the \ufb01rst-year intake before they had received any mathematics edu-\ncation input. Elsewhere more concise details concerned with methodological\nprocedures are available (Brown et al., 1999, pp. 303\u20135). \nThe four transcripts that feature in this article were chosen because the stu-\ndents themselves share certain similarities and the transcripts re\ufb02ect concern\nwith learning and teaching mathematics. Thus all four students, one from\neach year of the course, were women who, when starting the course, were\naged between 18 and 19. Three of them had gained a C grade pass at GCSE\nwhilst the fourth had acquired a B. All four had expressed a dislike of math-\nematics when they were at school, and each of the students maintained that\nthey lacked competence in the subject. \nRereading the transcripts\nThe interview began with the question \u2018What is the \ufb01rst thing that comes into\nyour mind when you think of maths?\u2019\nI know I\u2019m not very good at it \u2026.\nIt\u2019s a way of adding and multiplying and taking away certain things \u2026\nMaths relates to numbers \u2026 It\u2019s so big. [Year 1]\nMaths is scary \u2026 I\u2019ve always not been wonderful at maths. [Year 2]\nThe second-year student then expanded on \u2018what maths is\u2019:\n\u2026 numbers, problems, day-to-day activities. I know maths is involved in\nmore or less everything I do in my life. We talked about that in lectures \u2026\nR\ne\ns\ne\na\nr\nc\nh\n \ni\nn\n \nE\nd\nu\nc\na\nt\ni\no\nn\nN\no\n.\n \n6\n3\n4There\u2019s the very complicated side of maths \u2026 When you\u2019re sat down and\ndoing sums intensely, GCSE, algebra, that sort of thing \u2026 but if you\u2019re going\nback to the roots, back to the simplest basic points of maths, then it\u2019s to do\nwith day-to-day problems and helping you through life \u2026 We talked about\nthat \u2026 It\u2019s sorting out of things as well as the complicated side of things \u2026\norganisational skills \u2026 sorting washing, blacks and whites \u2026 that\u2019s all maths\n\u2026 Common factors or differences \u2026 that\u2019s maths \u2026 I didn\u2019t realise this\nbefore I came on the course \u2026 We\u2019ve unpicked a lot on the course \u2026 and\nit\u2019s made me think maths isn\u2019t just scary numbers on a piece of paper, which\nI used to think.\nThis student appears to have developed a means of managing mathematics,\nand in part her strategy is a consequence of college sessions. Mathematics, it\nwould seem, is conceptualised as a series of binary oppositions. On the one\nhand there is the \u2018very complicated side of mathematics\u2019 whilst on the other\nthere are the \u2018simplest basic points\u2019. Using these two polarisations the stu-\ndents\u2019 responses could be presented as follows:\nComplicated maths Simplest basic points\nSat down  Active\nDoing sums  Going back to roots\nAlgebra Day-to-day problems\nGCSE Helping you through life\nPieces of paper Common factors\nScary numbers Differences in things\nNumbers, money\nShopping lists\nGrouping things\nSorting things out\nOrganisation\nIt would seem that through a process which is captured in the statement\n\u2018We\u2019ve unpicked a lot of things on this course\u2019 the student makes certain\nmoves. It is a collective move in which she and her year group, together with\nthe college tutor, work together at \u2018unpicking\u2019 mathematics so that aspects\nof it may be valorised. By way of the discursive practices of college mathe-\nmatics the student is motivated to leave behind that \u2018scary maths\u2019 which is\nlocated in and associated with \u2018doing sums intensely\u2019. Rather, she \ufb01nds her-\nself moving back to the \u2018roots\u2019 and to the \u2018simplest basic points\u2019 in order that\nshe may progress forward towards teacherhood. And as she travels there is,\nwe believe, a sense of her beginning to collect some of the cultural baggage\nwhich has come to be associated with primary mathematics; certain terms \u2013\nfor example, \u2018groups\u2019, \u2018common factors\u2019, \u2018organisation\u2019 \u2013 signal her entry\ninto the discourse of primary mathematics. In effect, emotional and cogni-\ntive shifts are taking place within the self. There are the internal realisations\nthat mathematics both exists and \u2013 importantly \u2013 can be understood even\nwithin mundane activities of everyday life. Simultaneously external changes\nalso occur; she is now beginning to sound like a primary teacher. \nA\nn\n \ne\nn\nq\nu\ni\nr\ny\n \ni\nn\nt\no\n \nt\nr\na\nn\ns\ni\nt\ni\no\nn\ns\n5And what of the third and fourth-year students? How did they use notions\nof \u2018identity\u2019? It appeared that the fourth-year student also dichotomised\nmathematics. She polarised the subject as either \u2018do-able\u2019 or \u2018not do-able\u2019,\nwhere by implication mathematics is subdivided between that which can and\nthat which cannot be understood. She says:\nSimple calculations \u2013 adding, subtraction, multiplication and division \u2013 I can\ndo, no problem. When you get into algebra \u2026 I can\u2019t do it \u2026 It\u2019s the more\ncomplicated things like statistics that frighten me \u2026 I love addition because\nit\u2019s simple. I do things like area, capacity and volume because they\u2019re prac-\ntical. I liked trigonometry \u2026 you were given a question \u2013 you had a triangle\nin front of you and you could see that one of the the sides or one of the bases\nwas going to be longer than the other, or whatever, so you could work out\nroughly what it was going to be, whether it was going to be a reasonable\nanswer or completely out of this world \u2026 whereas algebra \u2026 it doesn\u2019t\nreally mean anything.\nHer response could be arranged as:\nNot do-able maths Do-able maths\nComplicated algebra  Simple basic calculations\nFear Love\nCompletely out of this world Reasonable answer\nDoesn\u2019t mean anything Means something\nMeanwhile, the third-year student posited the following theory which, so it\nseemed, helped in explaining her lack of mathematical competence:\nSomewhere along the line I just think that I\u2019ve not understood it properly\n\u2026 I personally feel that maths \u2013 to know how to do things you have to\nunderstand it in you as a person \u2026 Sometimes I ponder over it, and then I\nthink, \u2018I should know this anyway.\u2019\nWhat is being implied here? Does the student, for instance, conceptualise the\nlearning and understanding of mathematics as occurring along a linear devel-\nopmental line? So that when she does master a particular problem her suc-\ncess is never read in fulsome terms. Rather, she thinks, \u2018I should have known\nit anyway.\u2019 That is, she should have learned \u2018it\u2019 at some speci\ufb01c or particular\npoint en route to the present. By constraining herself within a particular way\nof perceiving mathematical knowledge and its development, it would seem,\na lack or gap will always exist between herself and the idealised mathematics\nstudent, \u2018who can understand it in you as a person\u2019. \nEchoes of this notion of \u2018understanding it in you as a person\u2019 could\nbe found in the transcripts of the other students. There were, of course,\nvariations in the ways it was expressed. For example, the \ufb01rst-year student\ncategorised people as either \u2018mathematical sorts of persons\u2019 or \u2018arty sorts\u2019.\nFurthermore, because she de\ufb01ned herself as an \u2018arty sort\u2019 she considered\nthat her chances of fully understanding mathematics were curtailed. To\nquote:\nR\ne\ns\ne\na\nr\nc\nh\n \ni\nn\n \nE\nd\nu\nc\na\nt\ni\no\nn\nN\no\n.\n \n6\n3\n6I think if you sat there and learnt and learnt and learnt I still don\u2019t think you\ncould change the way you were. I don\u2019t think you can suddenly become a\nmathematical sort of person. I mean, I had tutoring for my GCSE and I had\na lot of help from my teacher and no matter how much they explained things\nit still took me a long time \u2026 other people got it just like that. \nSimilarly, the second-year student talks about her brother as able to do math-\nematics \u2018just like that\u2019. He, apparently, \u2018doesn\u2019t spend hours doing maths, but\nwhen he has to do it, it comes, just like that\u2019. \nWhat are some of the consequences of these perceptions? What, for\nexample, are the effects of placing oneself in the \u2018not capable\u2019 category? One\nreverberation, which is highlighted in the third-year transcript, is that \nmathematical achievement is perceived as paradoxical; success is always \nshadowed by failure: she \u2018should have known it anyway\u2019. Similarly, the fourth-\nyear student found the learning of mathematics \u2018very, very hard. For some\npeople it just naturally clicks but I have to work and work and work at it\u2019 (our\nemphasis). What are the implications for being \u2018teacher of mathematics\u2019 when\nthe student has located herself within the \u2018not-capable of mathematics\u2019 cate-\ngory? It would seem that, rather than being perceived as a hindrance, this par-\nticular construction appears to become a strong motivating force. Thus the\n\ufb01rst-year student \u2013 who, it should be remembered, has had no college input \u2013\nforesees that because she has \u2018struggled so much, I think it would bene\ufb01t me.\u2019\nShe goes on to map out certain ideas for the teaching of mathematics:\nI\u2019d want to give them as much of the basics as I could because I think that\nwould prepare them more \u2026 I\u2019d do it very practically. I\u2019d say, \u2018Count these\nand count these \u2026 what happens when you put them together? I wouldn\u2019t\nsay, \u2018Now add them up,\u2019 I\u2019d say, \u2018What happens when we move this pile of\nbricks to this pile?\u2019 How many are there altogether?\nwhilst the third-year student would\nTry to understand where the children were coming from and where they got\ntheir ideas from to start with \u2026 and I would \u2026 break things down step by\nstep rather than everything just seem like taught as a whole \nThe fourth-year student, so it would seem, credits the university course with\nhelping her make the transition from \u2018learner\u2019 to \u2018teacher\u2019:\nAnd it was kind of \u2026 we are going to teach you how to learn this the same\nway that children will, and that gives you a very good understanding of how\nthe children learn maths, as well \u2026 You\u2019ve been through that same process,\nas you are going to teach the children, and you know what to expect and\nyou know broad outcomes of what might happen.\nFrom this we offer the following speculative thoughts. It would appear that,\nfor the fourth-year student, shifts in location, including that between being\n\u2018learner of mathematics\u2019 and being \u2018teacher of mathematics\u2019, is not a linear\nprocess. In order to take on the future role of teacher, the student feels that\nwithin the context of college mathematics sessions she is repositioned as \u2018the\nchild\u2019. As \u2018the child\u2019 she can attend to the \u2018basics\u2019 and the \u2018simplest points of\nA\nn\n \ne\nn\nq\nu\ni\nr\ny\n \ni\nn\nt\no\n \nt\nr\na\nn\ns\ni\nt\ni\no\nn\ns\n7maths\u2019 and in so doing she can leave behind all those negative aspects of\nmathematics. Upon entering school as a teacher she will be able to demon-\nstrate that she is indeed a teacher; she will be able, for example, to control,\norganise and structure the primary classroom (see Brown et al., 1999, p.\n313). But when it comes to the teaching of mathematics, internally she will\nbe in many ways \u2018the child\u2019 and it is this imaging of herself that will provide\nher with the con\ufb01dence to teach.\nRereading the scripts, it seemed to us that, because of their own struggle\nwith mathematics, the students were determined to deliver the subject in\nterms other than those of their own experience. As teachers they will learn\nfrom their own gaps, omissions and de\ufb01ciencies in the subject. In effect, they\nwill take all those things that in the past they have perceived as preventing\nthem from developing mathematical competence and they will assert the\nauthority of the \u2018opposition\u2019. So the students did not, it seemed, want to\nbecome \u2018mathematical\u2019 types; rather, they appeared to draw strength from\nbeing the Other to this construct (Walkerdine, 1990, p. 62). And it would\nappear that college helps to strengthen this persona: \nI didn\u2019t enjoy it because it was \u2026 complicated, \u2026 intense, dif\ufb01cult, hard.\nDidn\u2019t like it \u2013 boring \u2026 so I thought, from that, well \u2026 the children I was\ngoing to be teaching, I don\u2019t want them to be taught like that, so I\u2019ve been\nthinking about different ways of teaching which have come from university.\nThey\u2019ve helped in, say, in practical sessions, relating it to the home \u2026 You\nuse maths every day in everything that I never thought of \u2026 washing, sort-\ning out, organisational skills, variation in things, differences in things, com-\nmon factors in things like three people have got brown hair, that\u2019s maths,\nit\u2019s relating it to just people. It doesn\u2019t have to be dif\ufb01cult like I did at GCSE\nto be able to understand maths, so I thought, I like this approach, I enjoy it,\nit\u2019s easy to relate to, it\u2019s not tedious, it\u2019s interesting \u2026 Went on my school\nexperience \u2026 did a practical approach, and it worked, so therefore I\u2019ve got\ncon\ufb01dence. I know what works. I know I have to go into everything thor-\noughly before I teach, but as long as I make it interesting, don\u2019t let the chil-\ndren lose it, get bored, then it should be OK. [Year 2]\nConcluding thoughts\nOur readings should be regarded as tentative explorations which neverthe-\nless can work at focusing attention on the signi\ufb01cance of identity and its rela-\ntion to transitional journeys. So, for the students we have met in this article,\nin order to succeed, mathematics must feature \u2018in the \u201cgenes\u201d\u2019 (be part of\nyour identity, make-up). It just \u2018clicks\u2019 or it doesn\u2019t. If you are an \u2018arty per-\nson\u2019 any success in mathematics tends to be overshadowed by the failures of\nthe past, and in this way future experience with mathematics is always pre-\nscribed. The non-specialist trainee teacher, destined to include mathematics\nin her professional repertoire, appears to be wedded to the failed pupil but\nseeks to revoke those characteristics of mathematics classrooms that are\nassociated with failure. In some measure this means declining to assume the\nR\ne\ns\ne\na\nr\nc\nh\n \ni\nn\n \nE\nd\nu\nc\na\nt\ni\no\nn\nN\no\n.\n \n6\n3\n8identity of \u2018a mathematical sort of person\u2019, frequently pathologised in the\n\ufb01gures of mathematics teachers assembled from the past .\nWe end by offering a caricature of the journey made by the students. First,\nmathematics as a demon is powerful and in various ways it subjugates the stu-\ndent and \ufb01lls them with fear and loathing. But, in jumping out of the closet,\nmathematics is \u2018outed\u2019. It is removed from the dark and abstract underworld.\nIn the light it is possible to see mathematics\u2019s softer side. This aspect, besides\nbeing fun, is also basic and practical. In fact maths is so friendly that, besides\nletting it loose with children, you can, if you are so inclined, let it lick you. \nReferences\nBall, D. L.
