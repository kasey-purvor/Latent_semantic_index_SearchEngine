The so-\ncalled \u201cterahertz gap\u201d has now been bridged through the de-\nvelopment of efficient generation and detection systems,1\nand applications are rapidly emerging in the generation,\nfiltering,2 and imaging and spectroscopy3 of terahertz\nradiation4 for biomedical, security, and manufacturing con-\ntrol. However, the continued development of terahertz-based\nsystems is reliant upon the implementation of techniques to\nguide, focus, and filter the radiation effectively.\nSpectral filters are an important element of most systems\nwhich manipulate radiation, and it has recently been demon-\nstrated that metallic photonic crystals of appropriate dimen-\nsions possess passbands5 in the terahertz region, and the po-\nsitions and widths of the passbands are defined by the\ngeometry of the photonic crystal. Experimental studies of the\ntransmission of terahertz radiation in such structures6 have\nconfirmed the theoretical results showing that metallic pho-\ntonic crystals \u0001pillar array\u0002 can have a maximum transmis-\nsion close to unity within some bands. However, an ideal\nspectral filter should allow the complete transmission of ra-\ndiation for a particular frequency range and zero transmis-\nsion outside that range. In other words, it should have a\nsingle passband.\nIn this paper, we demonstrate that more complex struc-\ntures, based on the metallic pillar forest, can isolate, and\neven sharpen, specific pass-bands, and hence provide filter-\ning technology in a region where traditional electrical tech-\nniques are difficult to implement. Specifically, we have fab-\nricated by micromachining dual structures that are\ncombinations of two two-dimensional \u00012D\u0002 square-lattice\nphotonic crystals formed by metallic pillars, as shown in Fig.\n1, and have measured and modeled their terahertz transmis-\nsion properties.\nMicromachining is the fabrication of three dimensional\nsurfaces and structures on the submicron to millimeter scale,\nand is therefore well suited to the fabrication of terahertz\nartificial materials \u0001where 1 THz\u0005300 \u0001m\u0002. Both surface\nand bulk techniques are well established for the fabrication\nof three dimensional topologies at micron resolution. The\nprocesses are adapted from those used in the integrated cir-\ncuit industry and therefore can be readily implemented in\nproduction environments.\nThe fabrication of high aspect ratio pillar arrays is\nachieved via an SU8 fabrication process. First, an optically\nopaque metal, such as gold, is evaporated onto a glass wafer.\nThe metal is then patterned with holes where the SU8 should\nremain to form the pillars. Then, a layer of SU8-50 is drop\ndispensed onto the glass wafer and confined by an o-ring\nduring its soft bake stage, which is performed for 5 h at\n120 \u00b0C. After cooling, the wafer is flipped over and exposed\nwith broadband UV in order to partially crosslink the SU8.\nFull crosslinking is achieved after a postexposure bake of 1 h\nat 120 \u00b0C. The wafer is then developed in Microposit EC\nsolvent and air dried to release the micropillar arrays. Using\nthis technique, pillars can readily be fabricated with diam-\neters as small as 40 \u0001m and heights in excess of 1 mm.\nHowever, smaller pillar diameters \u0001i.e., smaller apertures in\nthe gold layer\u0002 restrict the incident UV and act to limit the\nfinal pillar height. The SU8 is fairly transparent to the inci-\ndent terahertz radiation, and therefore it is necessary to sput-a\u0002Electronic mail: a.j.gallant@durham.ac.uk\nAPPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS 91, 161115 \u00012007\u0002\n0003-6951\/2007\/91\u000216\u0001\/161115\/3\/$23.00 \u00a9 2007 American Institute of Physics91, 161115-1\nDownloaded 07 Dec 2010 to 129.234.252.66.

The\npillars can effectively be treated as metal rods because the\ngold layer is much thicker than the skin depth. The fabrica-\ntion technique is very adaptable since complex pillar arrays\ncan be created by simply changing the photolithographic\nmask that defines the metal pattern on the glass substrate.\nThe terahertz transmission measurements were per-\nformed in a terahertz time domain spectroscopy system\nwhich has a usable bandwidth of approximately 3 THz. A\nTi:sapphire laser produced a 600 mW pulse of 20 fs duration\nwith a repetition rate of 76 MHz. This was separated into a\nterahertz-generating beam and a gating beam with a 70:30\nbeam splitter. The generating beam was focused onto an\nlow temperature grown GaAs photoconductive strip line\nemitter which was dc biased to 250 V. Parabolic mirrors\nwere used to focus the terahertz signal onto the pillar array\nsample.\nThe beam diameter was approximately 1 mm and com-\nparable to the height of the pillars. At lower frequencies\n\u0001hundreds of gigahertz\u0002, the beam was more divergent and\ncould therefore pass over the top of the pillars, leading to\nsome unfiltered leakage. The gating and the terahertz beam\nwere focused onto a 1 mm thick ZnTe electro-optic crystal,\nwhich, in conjunction with a balanced detector, were used to\ndetect the transmitted terahertz radiation. A delay line for the\ngeneration signal allowed the electric field of the terahertz\npulse to be scanned in the time domain. A fast Fourier trans-\nform was then used to obtain a frequency spectrum. The\nsystem provided a usable bandwidth of approximately\n3 THz.\nFor a frequency interval corresponding to a passband,\nthe pillar array is transparent to the incident radiation,\nwhereas for frequencies outside a passband, the radiation is\nreflected. The widths and positions of the passbands are de-\nfined by the geometrical parameters of the system. For a\nphotonic crystal with a square lattice formed by an array of\nparallel pillars, the relevant parameters are the period of the\nstructure a and the pillar diameter D. If one combines two\ndifferent pillar arrays, as shown in Fig. 1, then the resulting\nfilter is expected to be transparent in the frequency interval,\nwhich is formed by the overlap of the passband of the indi-\nvidual pillar arrays. The resulting transmission will also de-\npend on the separation G between the two pillar arrays \u0003see\nFig. 1\u0001a\u0002\u0004.\nFigure 2 shows calculated7 and measured transmission\nspectra of various combined filters made from two square\nlattice pillar arrays with pillar diameters D=60 \u0001m and\nD=70 \u0001m, respectively, and a uniform height of 1 mm. The\nperiod of all the arrays is a=200 \u0001m, but different values of\nthe gap G are considered. The horizontal bars in Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002\nshow the passbands for individual pillar arrays; the pass-\nbands for the different dual arrays are centered at approxi-\nmately 1.4 THz. Figure 2\u0001a\u0002 shows the spectra for the com-\nbined filters with a gap G=a=200 \u0001m, for which the\ncrystalline lattice is preserved. In the calculated spectrum,\none can see that the transmission band corresponds to the\noverlap of the passbands of the individual pillar arrays. For\nthe first and third bands, the overlap is small, the transmis-\nsion for the bands is less than that for the second band, and\nthe transmission of the dual structure can be seen as small\npeaks in the calculated spectrum. In contrast, for the second\nFIG. 1. \u0001a\u0002 Schematic view of a dual structure made by combining two 2D\nsquare-lattice photonic crystals formed by metallic pillars. \u0001b\u0002 Scanning\nelectron microscopy image of the structure.\nFIG. 2.

In the experimental spec-\ntrum, the second and fourth bands are well pronounced, but\nthe value of the transmission coefficient is smaller due to\nout-of-plane scattering. An increase of the gap G to 250 \u0001m\n\u0003Fig. 2\u0001b\u0002\u0004 leads to the suppression of all except for the sec-\nond band in the calculated spectrum, and the experimental\nspectrum also shows similar behavior. In the experimental\nspectra for the cases G=250 \u0001m and G=300 \u0001m, one can\nsee a pronounced second band, but the value of the transmis-\nsion coefficient decreases with increasing gap due to out-of-\nplane scattering in the gap region, and when the gap becomes\nas large as G=350 \u0001m \u0003Fig. 2\u0001d\u0002\u0004, the transmission band in\nthe experimental spectrum disappears.\nSuppression of the transmission band by varying the gap\nsize can be explained using the following arguments. An\noverlap of the passbands in the individual pillar arrays is\nnecessary for transmission, but it is also necessary for a\nBloch mode of the electromagnetic field in the first indi-\nvidual array to excite a Bloch mode in the second array. In\nphotonic crystals with different pillar diameters, the spatial\nstructure of the Bloch electromagnetic modes for the same\nfrequency is different,8 and for a specific range of the gap\nsizes, the spatial structure of the field in the gap, induced by\nthe Bloch mode in the first array, does not excite Bloch\nmodes in the second array.\nBy optimizing the parameters of the combined filters,\none can obtain a transmission spectrum with a single, iso-\nlated, and nearly square-shaped passband. Figure 3 shows\nthe transmission spectra of combined filters comprising two\npillar arrays with a period of 200 \u0001m separated by a gap\nG=300 \u0001m. Both the experimental and calculated spectra\nshow an isolated passband centered at 1.4 THz with a width\nof about 0.3 THz.\nFor comparison, Fig. 4 shows the transmission spectra of\na graded structure consisting of four rows of pillars with\ndiameters of 40, 50, 60, and 70 \u0001m. One can see that the\nstructure of the spectra is similar to that of an individual\npillar array6 with several passbands. This example illustrates\nthat to obtain a well defined passband, one should use pillar\narrays with enough layers to form a Bloch wave.\nWe have demonstrated passbands filters for terahertz ra-\ndiation based on the combination of two individual pillar\narrays separated by a gap. The resultant passband is charac-\nterized by a virtually flat-topped transmission spectrum.\nThe authors wish to acknowledge the support of the\nEngineering and Physical Science Research Council of the\nUnited Kingdom \u0001Grant No. EP\/C534263\u0002.\n1J.
