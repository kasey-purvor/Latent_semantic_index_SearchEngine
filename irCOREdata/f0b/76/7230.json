There are a number of practical difficulties\nassociated with catering for different cognitive styles of CAL users. This paper identifies\nnot only a style which influences CAL-user performance and overcomes many of the\ndifficulties, but also a possible suitable measure of that style. Data on the reliability of\nthis measure is reported, along with preliminary work on its use to cater for CAL users\nwith different cognitive styles. Future work will focus on the development of the package\nand the predictive validity of the style measure.\nCognitive styles and Computer-Assisted Learning (CAL)\nCognitive style has been variously defined (e.g. Kogan, 1971; Messick, 1970, 1976, 1984) but\nessentially means the unique and preferred way in which individuals process information.\nAlthough the notion can be traced back to the beginning of the century (Coop and Sigel,\n1971), it gained recognition in the 1950s and 1960s as a significant personal characteristic\nwhich increased the understanding of how people learn (e.g. Witkin et al, 1962). However,\nrecognition of its importance in education generally (Kogan, 1971; Messick, 1970, 1976,\n1984) and CAL specifically (James and James, 1990; Sharma, 1987; Sims, 1988) has been\nrelatively recent.\nSince any computer-assisted information system consists of three major components -\nhardware, software and the user - it is important that the concept of cognitive style as a\nsignificant characteristic of the user be catered for in the production of a CAL program.\n47\nJohn Clarke Cognitive style and CAL: problems and a possible solution\nAlthough there has been recognition of this for some time (Barker, 1982), there are still\nconsistent calls for the development of programs which allow users to choose how they wish\nto learn (Chadwick and Watson, 1986; Duncan, 1985).\nA plethora of cognitive styles has been identified and reported (e.g. Kogan, 1971; Joughin,\n1989; Rowland and Stuessy, 1987) but often, the styles differ more in name than in nature.\nThe vast majority of cognitive styles can be classified into either a preference for a reasonable\ndegree of structure and guidance to be provided in the learning situation, or a preference for\nconsiderable freedom to choose the direction that learning should take. Essentially, this is\npreference for structured guided instruction versus unstructured discovery learning. As far as\nthe delivery of CAL is concerned, the 'structured' end of the continuum is catered for by the\ntraditional tutorial-type programs while the 'unstructured' end is served best by simulation\/\ngame-type programs.\nProblems in catering for cognitive styles\nThere are a number of practical difficulties associated with trying to cater for different\ncognitive styles:\nThe vast number of styles\nAs already noted, many styles have been identified, researched and reported but the vast\nmajority can be coalesced into a continuum ranging from a heavy dependence on structure\nand guidance, to a strong preference for minimal structure and guidance.\nThe measurement of styles\nMany measures of cognitive style have to be individually administered - such as the\nrod-and-frame test for field dependence-independence (Witkin et al, 1962) - and hence are not\ntime- and cost-effective. Most of these individual measures are complemented by group\npencil-and-paper tests, the Group Embedded Figures Test for field dependence-independence,\nfor example (Witkin et al, 1971) but these still require considerable time to complete and\nanalyse.\nIncorporating the measure of style into the CAL program\nResearch investigating the relationship between cognitive style and CAL performance has\ninvariably measured style independently of the user's involvement with the program and has\nused non-computer-based procedures (e.g. James and James, 1990; Rowland and Stuessy,\n1987). This again is time-consuming, and feedback on the appropriate type of program for the\nuser is delayed. Ideally, any measure of style should occur as an immediate prerequisite to\ninvolvement in the program. A computer-based measurement procedure would also streamline\nthe process.\n48\nALT-J VOLUME 1 NUMBER 1\nPreparing appropriate versions of the same program to cater for\ndifferent styles.\nMost research focuses either on how CAL users with different styles cope with a particular\nCAL presentation (e.g. Clements and Gullo, 1984; Post, 1985) or on learners' comparative\nperformance in CAL versus other non-computer-based modes of presenting material (e.g.\nDahl, 1985; Wesley, 1984). There has been some research that has attempted to match style\nwith an appropriate CAL presentation (e.g. Rowland and Stuessy; 1987).\nA possible solution\nTo overcome these problems, what is required is the identification of a style which is\nmeaningful in the context of learners interacting with CAL materials, which can be measured\neasily and reliably and which can be incorporated in the CAL presentation. Once this is\nachieved, the next step is to prepare an appropriate CAL package which can accommodate the\ndifferent learning styles which have been identified.\nThe earlier discussion highlighted a style which not only subsumes many of the disparate\nstyles in the literature but is also appropriate to CAL presentation. The style ranges on a\ncontinuum from a preference for a reasonable degree of structure and guidance to be provided\nin the learning situation, to a preference for considerable freedom to choose the direction that\nlearning should take. Such a style has been identified by Pask and his co-workers (Pask, 1973,\n1976; Pask and Scott, 1972). The learners at the two extremes of the continuum are referred\nto as 'serialists' and 'holists'. Serialists prefer to learn just the essential facts which should be\nwell defined, sequentially ordered and related by simple links. They like to use a simple\nstep-by-step strategy and consequently regard embellishments such as anecdote, illustration\nand analogy as quite distracting. Holists, on the other hand, prefer a more global approach to\nproblem-solving. They use more complex non-linear 'globetrotting' strategies, and thrive on\nanecdote, illustration and analogy. By focusing on a 'global' approach, they concentrate on\nsynthesizing broad overviews into which details may be fitted. By contrast, serialists use more\nof a 'local' approach, concentrating on specifics which may then lead to the emergence of an\noverall picture. Individuals able to function happily either way are referred to as 'versatile'.\nEntwistle (1978,1981) summarizes the research associated with this serialist\/holist style.\nApplication of the serialist\/holist style to CAL\nIdentifying an appropriate style is only the first step. What is also required is a quick and\nreliable measure of that style which can be incorporated into a CAL program. The original\nidentification procedures used by Pask (1973) are pencil-and-paper tests, and are quite lengthy\nand complex. Building on Pask's work, Entwistle (1981) developed a more efficient 30-item\nShort Inventory of Approaches to Studying. In turn, Ford (1985) has developed an 18-item\nquestionnaire, Study Preference Questionnaire (SPQ) but unfortunately provides no\ninformation on its reliability. A copy of the questionnaire is given in the Appendix.\nThe requirement here is a quick and reliable measure of style. Ford found that using a small\nEnglish sample of 25 postgraduate students, one of the items (Question 16) in the SPQ\nsignificantly predicted serialist or holist tendencies at p<0.01 level. The item is:\n49\nJohn Clarke Cognitive style and CAL: problems and a possible solution\nWhen I'm reading a\nbook (or other informa-\ntion source) for my stu-\ndies, I prefer to work *\nthrough it fairly logi-\ncally from beginning to\nend.\n2 3 4\n-\nWhen I'm reading a\nbook (or other informa-\ntion source) for my stu-\n* dies, I prefer to skip\nabout and and 'dip in'\nquite a lot.\n(See the last page of the Appendix for the interpretation of the response scale.)\nIf a similar finding, derived from a reliable questionnaire can be produced using a sample for\nwhom CAL programs are to be produced - Australian in this case - it would provide a simple\nmethod of indicating the CAL user's cognitive style, and it could be very simply incorporated\ninto any CAL program.\nAn Australian replication of the Ford study\nThe ultimate aim of the project in which I am currently engaged (Clarke, in process) is to\nproduce CAL materials for teacher-education students in educational psychology. Hence, any\nreplication of Ford's work needs to involve such students. The SPQ was administered to 56\nstudents involved in a one-year postgraduate pre-service teacher-education course at a large\nteacher-education institution in Brisbane. All students had completed an undergraduate\nqualification at a different tertiary institution.\nThe responses were analysed with the aims of producing a reliable questionnaire and of\ndetermining if responses to any individual question were significantly correlated with\nresponses to the full questionnaire. The data was analysed using modules of the statistical\npackage SYSTAT (Wilkinson, 1988) and the results are reported below.2\nResults\nThe reliability of the 18-item questionnaire was estimated by using the coefficient alpha\nprocedure (Cronbach, 1951). Then, the correlation of each item with the alpha value, and\nsimultaneously the effect on alpha of removing individual items from the calculations, were\nmeasured. If the value of alpha increases with the removal of an item, it is possible to\nconclude that the item is not measuring the same characteristics as the total test and in fact is\ninterfering with obtaining a 'pure' measure of those characteristics. This process of removing\nitems therefore increases the reliability of the test. It is continued until alpha is not increased\nby any further removal of items. Five items were removed using this procedure. The results\nare summarized in Table 1.\nThe outcome of this analysis is the identification of a 13-item test which is much more\nreliable than the original 18-item measure. The alpha value increased from 0.594 to 0.670\nwhich is significant at the 0.01 level.\n. 50\nALT-J VOLUME 1 NUMBER 1\nCoefficient Alpha\n0.594\n0.635\n0.657\n0.668\n0.669\n0.670\nItem No.\n2\n12\n9\n11\n8\nNo item with\nCoefficient Alpha\nif item exluded\n0.635\n0.657\n0.688\n0.669\n0.670\nalpha > 0.670\nTable 1: Summary of the item elimination procedure\nTable 2: Individual item-total\nmeasure correlations\nItem\nnumber\n1\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7 O S\n10\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\nItem-alpha\ncorrelation\n0.418\n0.416\n0.359\n0.595\n0.423\n0.628\n0.404\n0.428\n0.446\n0.412\n0.4 27\n0.509\n0.356\nThe ultimate aim here is to identify an individual item that can be used instead of the total\n(now reduced) questionnaire. The correlations between each of the remaining 13 items and the\ncoefficient alpha are shown in Table 2.\nQuestion 7 has the highest correlation and hence could possibly be used to identify those\nstudents with serialist or holist tendencies. The item is as follows:\n7.

This could appear as a frame at the beginning of a CAL lesson.\nThose who choose 1 or 2 will be allocated to Version B; those who choose 4 or 5 will be\nallocated to Version A; those who choose 3 will be told that it doesn't really matter which\nversion they use, and will be given the option of choosing version A or or version B.\nThe next steps\nThere are at least two things that now need to be done. First, the preparation of a suite of\nCAL programs where each program is available in two versions - tutorial and simulation; and\nsecondly a measure of the predictive validity of Question 7. Work is proceeding on the former\n(Clarke, in process). Two versions of a program designed to introduce pre-service teacher\neducation students to 'How Children Learn' are being developed. Once these are available,\nwork can proceed on the latter.\nThe second issue, that of predictive validity, can be addressed in several ways. One approach\nwould be to gather data from users on the appropriateness or otherwise of the allocation made\nas a result of their response to Question 7 and their satisfaction with the type of learning\nexperience they subsequently have. Another approach would be to investigate the relative\nreliability of an allocation based on one question, compared to an allocation based on a small\ngroup of questions or an allocation based on simple user choice premised on information\nabout the two versions.\nNotes\n1. An earlier version of this paper was presented at the Seventh Annual Conference of the\nAustralian Society for Computers in Learning in Tertiary Education, Bond University, Gold\nCoast, Queensland, Australia, 10-13 December, 1989.\n2. The assistance of Dr D. Chant, Statistical Adviser to the Social Sciences, University of\nQueensland, in this analysis is gratefully acknowledged.\n3. One likely explanation is the potentially interfering effects of those items removed in the\nreliability analysis reported here. Other explanations could relate to differences in the size and\ncharacteristics of the samples.\n53\nJohn Clarke Cognitive style and CAL: problems and a possible solution\nReferences\nBarker, P.G.

When I'm reading a book\n(or other information source)\nfor my studies, I generally\ntend to concentrate on cer-\ntain parts, and skip over\nothers quite markedly, going\nback later if necessary to fill\nin any 'gaps' or 'missing\nlinks'.\nWhen I'm reading a book (or\nother information source) for\nmy studies, I tend to follow\nthe author's presentation rea-\nsonably closely, rather than\nskipping about a lot.\n2. When I'm studying for an\nessay, I try to gather as much 1\ninformation as possible at the\nstart.\nI prefer to have more of a\n5 'steady flow' throughout my\npreparation for the essay.\n3. When I'm studying I\ngenerally prefer to deal rea-\nsonably thoroughly with one\nbook (or other information\nsource) before moving on to\nanother.\nI generally prefer to have a\nnumber of books (or other\ninformation sources) 'on the\ngo' at the same time.\n4. When I'm studying a new\nsubject, I tend to want to\nkeep the whole picture of the\nsubject in my mind all the\ntime and find it hard \"to\nconcentrate on very detailed\naspects unless I can con-\nstantly relate them clearly to\nthe broad overall picture.\nOnce I've analysed the sub-\nject into its component parts,\nI like to focus on each of\nthese parts in detail, syste-\nmatically building up the\noverall picture bit by bit.\n5. When I'm in the library,\ngenerally speaking I tend to\nbe looking for specific\nbooks, etc. rather than\nbrowsing.\nI tend to spend quite a lot of\ntime browsing in the library.\n56\n1 2 3 4 5\n2 3 4\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 2 3 4 5\nALT-J VOLUME 1 NUMBER 1\n6. For students who learn in\nthe way I do, the best form\nof training in library use\nwould be to follow a well\nstructured course, building\nup from the basics and going\non to more complex skills\nthat will be essential for\nthem to know.\nFor students who learn in the\nway I do, the best form of\ntraining in library use would\nbe to learn skills (whether\nsimple or complex) as they\nencounter the need for them\nduring their studies (a sort of\n'on demand' teaching).\n7. When I'm reading a book\n(or other information source)\nfor my studies, I prefer to\nspend quite a long time\nskimming over and dipping\ninto it to get a clear picture\nof what it's about and how it\nwill be relevant.\nWhen I'm reading a book (or\nother information source) for\nmy studies, I prefer to get\nquite soon into a fairly detai-\nled reading of it once I know\nthat it's going to be useful,\nin the knowledge that its\nprecise relevance and contri-\nbution will become clear\nfrom a detailed reading.\n8. Generally I prefer to con-\ncentrate on one (or a very\nfew) aspect(s) of a subject at\na time when I'm learning\nabout it.\nGenerally I prefer to be\nlearning about a number of\ndifferent aspects of a subject\nat the same time.\n9. Once I've done a basic\nanalysis of what the subject\ninvolves, I'm happy to put to\nthe back of my mind tem-\nporarily the broad overall\npicture while I do some\nwork on more detailed\naspects.\nI tend to want to keep the\noverall picture uppermost in\nmy mind the whole time, and\nonly work on more detailed\naspects if I can see precisely\nhow they will fit into this\npicture.\n10. Summaries of a wide\nrange of books (and other\ninformation sources) would\nnot really be much use to me\nwhen I'm doing an essay - I\nreally need the full texts\nmore or less straight away.\nSummaries would be very\nuseful in the initial stages of\nmy work on an essay.\n57\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 2 3 4 5\nJohn Clarke Cognitive style and CAL: problems and a possible solution\n11. I like to approach a new\nsubject in a broad way -\noften looking at widely spa-\nced aspects of the subject\nand seeing how they may all\nfit together, before going\nback to 'fill in' any strictly\nlogical steps that I have\nskipped.\nI like the logical links bet-\nween different aspects of a\nnew subject to be very close,\nso that when I'm learning\nabout a second aspect I can\nsee very clearly how it\nrelates to the first aspect that\nI have already learned about,\nand so on.\n12.
