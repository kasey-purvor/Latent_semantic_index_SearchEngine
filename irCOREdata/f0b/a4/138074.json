A \nstudy carried out in 1987 showed that the ground-water in Port Harcourt area had a \nhydrocarbon contamination of 1.8 mg\/litre rather than the maximum of 0.1mg\/litre \nrecommended by the World Health Organization [1]: the situation has worsened \nsubsequently. This has prompted research into methods for remediating petroleum-\ncontaminated ground-water. One commonly used technique for removing organics \ndissolved in water involves the process of adsorption, which is the physical adhesion of \nthe polluting chemicals onto the surface of a solid. The most commonly-used adsorbent is \nthe highly-porous activated carbon, which has a relatively small volume, yet an enormous \nsurface area per unit mass, i.e. ~1000 m2\/g [2]. Activated carbon includes a wide range of \namorphous carbon-based materials produced with high porosities and extended inter-\nparticulate surface areas. It occurs commercially in two forms, granulated activated-\ncarbon (GAC) and powdered activated-carbon (PAC). GAC by definition is composed of \nultra-small particles [3]. Norit and Ultra Carbon are common trade names for this \nmaterial [4].   \nActivated carbon (AC) treatment systems usually consist of a series of large vessels (i.e. \nthe contacting basins), partially filled with the adsorbent. Contaminated water enters the \ntop of each vessel, trickles down through the AC (in granular or powdered form) and is \nreleased at the bottom. After a period of time, equilibrium is reached and the carbon is \nallowed to settle at the bottom of the vessel: the treated water is then removed [5]. \nEquilibrium is attained when the rate of adsorption of contaminant molecules onto the \nsurface of the adsorbent is the same as the rate of desorption of contaminant molecules \nfrom the surface of the adsorbent. An adsorption isotherm is a function expressing the \nrelationship between the amount of contaminant adsorbed and its concentration at a \nconstant temperature. The Freundlich adsorption-isotherm is the most commonly used in \nthe literature. \nHubbert [6] concluded that when dealing with crude-oil accumulation in subterranean \nwater, the immiscibility of the fluids is a salient feature. This leads to a consideration of \ndistinct fluid-fluid interfaces, which influence the treatment process to be used. In the \nexperiments described in this paper, contactors which reflected the distinct oil-water \ninterfaces were employed and the two forms of activated carbon, granular-activated \n 3\ncarbon (GAC) and powdered-activated carbon (PAC), were used to demonstrate the \nutility of the material in the treatment of petroleum-contaminated ground-water. The \npertinent adsorption isotherms were determined. This study was undertaken with the aim \nof ascertaining the effectiveness of activated carbon in adsorpbing petroleum \nhydrocarbons from contaminated ground-water systems. \n \nLocation from whence came the test specimens \nThe ground-water samples were collected from an existing well at Eagle Island in Port \nHarcourt, in the Niger Delta of Nigeria; the latter lies between latitudes 4o 15\u2019 N and 6o \n30\u2019 N and longitudes 5o 00\u2019 E and 8o 00\u2019 E. Port Harcourt city is within the tropical-\nrainforest belt of the country. The city receives an annual rainfall of about 3,000 mm and \nexperiences an annual average temperature of 27oC [1]. \nExperimental procedure \nGround-water samples from an existing well were collected in pre-rinsed 12-litre plastic \ncontainers, sealed and transported to the laboratory for analysis. The sampling and \nhandling of the ground-water conformed with the Directorate for Petroleum Resources \n(DPR) Guidelines and Standards [7]. \nSix glassware (contactors) were used for the five sets of treatment plants together with a \ntotal of thirty-two carbon contactors. The contactors were filled with the required \nvolumes of sampled water and contaminated with a fixed volume of crude-oil (i.e. the \nadsorbate). Contactor O was the control volume which was not subjected to any \ntreatment, Contactors A, B, C, D and E were treated with 5g, 10g, 15g, 20g and 25g of \nactivated carbon respectively. The entire procedure was accomplished first with PAC and \nsubsequently with GAC.  \nTreatment description \nThe samples treated with PAC were measured into 200ml volumes, after which two \ndifferent volumes of Bonny light-crude-oil (2ml and 20ml), were poured into the water \nsamples. The water samples treated with GAC were measured into 200ml and 20,000ml \nvolumes, which were contaminated with 2ml and 200ml respectively of the crude-oil. \nGreater masses of PAC and GAC were added thereafter. The treated water samples were \nleft to equilibrate for 7 days. A polyelectrolyte (sodium-chloride salt) was added to the \nsamples on the 8th day. It served as a coagulant to aid in the removal of fine carbon \nparticles as suggested by Tchobanoglous et al [8]. Physicochemical parameters of \nrepresentative samples such as pH value, electrical conductivity, turbidity, total dissolved \nsolids (TDS), chloride, sulphate, total alkalinity, as well as total hardness, calcium and \nmagnesium concentration were determined after periods of 7 and 10 days using methods \ndescribed by the American Public Health Association (APHA) [9]. The total petroleum \nhydrocarbon (TPH) analysis was undertaken using the procedure described by Concawe \n[10].  \n \n \n \n 4\nThe test results (see Tables 1\u21925) \nThe physicochemical characteristics of the ground-water used for this study were outside \nthe prescribed ranges by the World Health Organization (WHO) [11]. This occurs \nbecause of the numerous industrial activities located within the Niger Delta region: \nHorsfall and Spiff [1] and Odu et al [12] made similar observations. \n  \nThe results shown in Tables 2\u21924 are evidence of the ability of the adsorbent to strip-off \nthe contaminant. However, the adsorptive property of the two forms of the material \nvaried greatly. This may have been influenced by factors, such as particle size \ndistribution, concentration of the adsorbent, surface area and contact time. After the \nseven-day period, it was observed that the PAC adsorbed more of the contaminant than \nthe GAC. Henning and Degel [13] made a similar observation and reported that a faster \nrate of adsorption ensues when finer particles of activated carbon (AC) are used.  \n \nAn increase in the concentration of the PAC adsorbent led to a greater adsorption of the \ncontaminant - see Tables 4 and 5. However, the samples treated with GAC did not strictly \nfollow this trend. There was a decrease in the concentration of the adsorbate when 5 \n\u219215g of the adsorbent was used, after which the concentration increased (see Tables 2 \nand 3). This could be attributed to the inability of the adsorbent to be attached to the \ncontaminant molecules at an available adsorption site when higher concentrations of \nGAC were employed. Snoeyink and Summers [14] made a similar observation.  \n \nFurthermore, the surface area of the adsorbent affected the adsorption kinetics. That is \nwhy the adsorption was greater with the PAC than with GAC treatment, because PAC \nhas a greater surface-area-to-volume ratio than GAC. Also, the final concentration of the \nadsorbate, after ten days, was far less than the concentration obtained after the 7-day \nperiod (see Tables 2\u21925): this reveals the importance of determining the optimal contact-\ntime and the use of a coagulant in the adsorption kinetics. The coagulant aided the \nsettling of the carbon particles to the bottom of the vessel [8]. \n \nThe Freundlich isotherms (see Figures 1 and 2) revealed that the general adsorptive \nproperty of the treatment process was a function of the characteristics of both the carbon \nused and the solute (namely crude-oil). This could be observed from the performance of \nthe AC tests which followed the trend with respect to the amount of adsorption, namely \nPAC (Test 3) > PAC (Test 4) > GAC (Test1) > GAC (test 2), - see Tables 2 \u2192 5. \n \n \n \n \n \n 5\nTable 1: Physicochemical Characteristics of the well water \nParameters Value WHO International \nStandard (1985) \npH 5.5 6.5\u21928.5 \nConductivity. :S\/cm 155 0\u219240 \nTurbidity, NTU 2 1 \nTotal dissolved solids, mg\/litre 108.50 0\u2192500 \nChloride, mg\/litre 790.4 250 \nSulphate mg\/litre 15.23 150 \nTotal alkalinity, mg of CaCo3 per litre 20.00 Ns \nTotal hardness, mg of CaCo3 per litre 7.66 200\u2192250 \nCalcium, mg\/litre 30.60 75\u2192200 \nMagnesium, mg\/litre 2.80 30\u2192150 \n* Ns \u2013 No specification \n \nTable 2: Unadsorbed-oil contents arising from the treatment with GAC in 200ml of \nwater and 2ml of oil (Test 1): initial concentration, Co, of adsorbate in \nthe water=9304.70 mg\/litre \nContactor Mass of \nadsorbent, m \n(g) \nFinal concentration of \nadsorbate after day 7  \n(mg\/litre) \nFinal concentration of \nadsorbate after day 10  \nwith NaCl \n(mg\/litre) \nO 0 9304.70 9304.70 \nA 5 1140.55 473.51 \nB 10 1007.07 409.81 \nC 15 830.29 289.08 \nD 20 958.54 297.88 \nE 25 1001.01 335.19 \n \n \n \n \n 6\nTable 3: Unadsorbed-oil contents for the treatment with GAC in 20,000ml of water \nand 200ml of oil (Test 2): initial concentration, Co, of adsorbate in the \nwater=9304.70 mg\/litre \n \nContactor Mass of \nadsorbent, m \n(g) \nFinal concentration of \nadsorbate after day 7  \n(mg\/litre) \nFinal concentration of \nadsorbate after day 10  \nwith NaCl \n(mg\/litre) \nO 0 9304.70 9304.70 \nA 5 1560.67 634.73 \nB 10 1173.92 462.59 \nC 15 532.36 187.31 \nD 20 600.60 252.34 \nE 25 855.41 192.62 \n \n \nTable 4: The unadsorbed-oil contents arising from the treatment with PAC in 200ml \nof water and 2ml of oil (Test 3) : initial concentration, Co, of \nadsorbate in the water=9304.70 mg\/litre \n \nContactor Mass of \nadsorbent, m \n(g) \nFinal concentration of \nadsorbate after day 7  \n(mg\/litre) \nFinal concentration of \nadsorbate after day 10    \nwith NaCl \n(mg\/litre) \nO 0 9304.70 9304.70 \nA 5 201.48 19.72 \nB 10 187.46 14.86 \nC 15 141.96 14.14 \nD 20 18.74 8.74 \nE 25 14.37 4.37 \n \n \n \n \n 7\nTable 5: Unadsorbed-oil contents arising from the treatment with PAC in 200ml of \nwater and 20ml of oil (Test 4) : initial concentration, Co, of adsorbate \nin the water=9304.70 mg\/litre \n \nContactor Mass of \nadsorbent, m \n(g) \nConcentration of \nadsorbate after day 7 \n(mg\/litre) \nConcentration of \nadsorbate after day 10  \nwith NaCl \n(mg\/litre) \nO 0 9304.70 9304.70 \nA 5 197.16 159.86 \nB 10 148.17 140.60 \nC 15 141.36 115.27 \nD 20 138.94 87.36 \nE 25 128.00 43.68 \n \n \n \n \n \nTable 6:  Adsorbate concentrations (Test1): initial concentration, Co, of \nadsorbate in the water=9304.70 mg\/litre \n \n \nEquilibrium \nconcentration of \nadsorbate (Ce) \n(mg\/litre) \nCo - Ce \n(mg\/litre) \nMass of adsorbent, \nm \n(g) \n  (Co-Ce) \n m \n(mg\/g) \n9304.70 0.00 0 _ \n473.51 8831.19 5 1766.24 \n409.81 8894.89 10 889.49 \n289.08 9015.62 15 601.04 \n297.88 9006.82 20 450.34 \n335.19 8969.51 25 358.78 \n \n \n \n \n 8\nTable 7:  Adsorbate concentration (Test 4): initial concentration, Co, of \nadsorbate in the water=9304.70 mg\/litre \n \n \nEquilibrium \nconcentration of \nadsorbate (Ce) \n(mg\/litre) \nCo - Ce \n(mg\/litre) \nMass of adsorbent, \nm \n(g) \n  (Co-Ce) \n m \nmg\/g \n9304.70 0.00 0 _ \n159.86 9144.84 5 1828.97 \n140.60 9164.10 10 916.41 \n115.27 9189.43 15 612.63 \n87.36 9217.34 20 460.87 \n43.68 9261.02 25 370.44 \n \n \n \n Figure 1: Freundlich Adsorption Isotherm for GAC used \n \n \n1800 \n1600 \n1400 \n1200 \n1000 \n800 \n600 \n400 \n200 \n0\n100 200 400 300 500 0 \n(C\no \n\u2013 \nC\ne)\n \/ \nm\n, (\nm\ng\/\ng)\n  \n Equilibrium concentration, Ce, (mg \/litre)  \n 9\n \n    Figure 2: Freundlich adsorption isotherm for the PAC used \n \nConclusion and recommendations \n \nThe use of activated carbon (AC) is effective in the remediation of petroleum-\nhydrocarbon contaminated ground-water.
