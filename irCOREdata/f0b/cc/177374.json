The Survey of Sugar Intake among Children in Scotland was carried\nout in 2006 in those aged 3\u201317 years. Diet was assessed using the Scottish Collaborative Group FFQ, and interviews were carried out by trained\nfieldworkers who asked about dental health. A total of 1700 interviews were carried out, and 1512 FFQ were returned. Of the children, 56 % had\nreceived treatment for decay (fillings or teeth removed due to decay). Intake of non-milk extrinsic sugars (NMES), but not total sugar, increased\nthe risk of having had treatment for decay: adjusted OR 1\u00b784 (95 % CI 1\u00b728, 2\u00b764) for the highest ($20\u00b70 % food energy) v. lowest (#14\u00b78 % food\nenergy) tertile of NMES intake. This raised risk remained in children who reported brushing their teeth at least twice a day. Compared with\nchildren who reported brushing their teeth at least twice a day and were in the lowest tertile of NMES intake, children who reported brushing\ntheir teeth once a day or less and were in the highest tertile of NMES intake were over three times more likely to have received treatment\nfor decay (adjusted OR 3\u00b739, 95 % CI 1\u00b797, 5\u00b782). In order to improve dental health in children in Scotland, dental health strategies must continue\nto stress the importance of both reduced NMES intake and good oral hygiene.\nSugar: Dental decay: Children: Scotland\nDental caries (decay) occurs when bacteria living in dental\nplaque ferment dietary carbohydrate, producing acid that\nlowers plaque pH. When the pH at the tooth surface falls,\ndemineralisation occurs, with calcium and phosphates diffus-\ning out of the tooth enamel. Repeated exposure to reduced\nplaque pH results in sub-surface softening of the enamel,\nand the lesion can progress to form a carious cavity(1).\nDevelopment of caries is influenced by previous disease,\nuse of fluoride, plaque control, salivary flow, medical history\nand diet, which in turn are influenced by social factors.\nThe dietary factors include the amount of sugar consumed,\nsugar concentration of food, physical form of carbohydrate,\noral retentiveness (length of time teeth are exposed to reduced\nplaque pH), frequency of eating meals and snacks, length of\ninterval between eating and sequence of food consumption(1).\nIn particular, the amount and frequency of consumption of\nnon-milk extrinsic sugars (NMES) are considered to be the\nmajor causes of dental caries in the UK(2). NMES are those\nsugars which are not located within the cellular structure of\na food, and exclude the sugar in milk (almost all lactose)\nwhich is not thought to contribute to dental caries(2). There-\nfore, NMES includes all sugars in fruit juices as well as\ntable sugar, honey and the sucrose, glucose and glucose\nsyrups added to foods.\nGood oral hygiene is central to the strategy for improving\nchildren\u2019s dental health. It is recommended that teeth require\nfrequent brushing (at least twice a day) from an early age(1,3),\nand it has been suggested that frequent brushing (with a fluor-\nide toothpaste) may have greater impact on the prevention\nof caries in young children than restricting sugary foods(4).\nSocio-economic inequalities in tooth brushing habits persist,\nboth in Scotland(5) and in many other countries(6), with family\naffluence associated with a higher prevalence of frequent\ntooth brushing.\nChildren in Scotland have poorer dental health than\nchildren in England or Wales(7,8). Within Scotland, dental\nhealth has changed little between 1998 and 2003(9), although\nthe proportion of boys and girls brushing teeth at least twice\na day has risen between 1998 and 2006 (from 56\u201357 %\nto 63\u201366 % in 11-, 13- and 15-year-old boys, and from\n67\u201378 % to 78\u201382 % in 11-, 13- and 15-year-old girls)(5).\nPoor dental health in children may lead to physical pain,\nembarrassment and absences from school as well as to\ndemands on health care budgets(3).

The survey found that mean\nNMES intake was much higher than recommendations at\n17\u00b74 % of food energy in children aged 3\u201317 years(13). Intakes\nwere similar in boys and girls, but increased significantly with\nage, from 15\u00b78 % of food energy in 3\u20137 year olds up to 19\u00b71 %\nof food energy in 12\u201317 year olds(13).\nThe aim of the present analysis was to assess the strength\nof the association between intakes of sugars and foods that\nare significant sources of NMES and treatment for dental\ncaries with adjustment for confounding factors, and the\nimpact that frequent tooth brushing has on this association,\nin children aged 3\u201317 years living in Scotland. The data\nused were from the recent national Survey of Sugar Intake\namong Children in Scotland(13).\nMethods\nFull details of the methodology for the Survey of Sugar Intake\namong Children in Scotland can be found in the final report\n(the supplementary material for this article can be found at\nhttp:\/\/www.journals.cambridge.org\/bjn)(13). A brief summary\nis provided here.\nSample\nA named sample of 2800 Scottish children aged 3\u201316 years\non 1 May 2006 was drawn from eighty postcode sectors\nacross Scotland using the Department of work and pensions\nchild benefit records. Three hundred and two children were\nexcluded by the Department of Work and Pensions as sensitive\ncases or because they were involved in other surveys, and 146\nparents\/guardians chose to opt out after an initial invitation\nletter had been sent. An FFQ, used to estimate habitual dietary\nintake, was sent to the remaining 2352 children.\nFieldworkers arranged a home visit during which they\nchecked the completed FFQ. If the FFQ had not been\ncompleted, a further copy was left with the family with a\nreply-paid envelope. Height and weight were measured by\nthe fieldworkers, and data on demographic characteristics,\nphysical activity and dental health were collected by compu-\nter-assisted personal interview using questions that were the\nsame as those used in the 2003 Scottish health survey(9).\nThe dental health module included questions on attendance\nat a dentist, treatment received from a dentist and frequency\nof toothbrushing. For children aged under 12 years, the inter-\nview was conducted with the parent or guardian. Children\naged 12 years and over were asked to complete the questions\nrelated to dental health themselves with help from a parent or\nguardian as necessary.\nFieldwork was carried out between May and September\n2006. A total of 1700 interviews were conducted and\n1512 FFQ were returned. Both interview and FFQ data were\nprovided for 1491 children (66 % of those invited to partici-\npate).\nThe present study did not require the approval of a National\nHealth Service research ethics committee, but it was carried\nout in accordance with the research governance and quality\nassurance policies of the Scottish Centre for Social Research\nand the Institute of Applied Health Sciences at the University\nof Aberdeen (http:\/\/www.abdn.ac.uk\/iahs\/research-govern-\nance\/governance.shtml). After the initial opt out, consent\nwas given by completion of the FFQ and written consent\nwas obtained for the interview and measurements.\nDietary data\nThe Scottish Collaborative Group FFQ(14) was used to estimate\nthe habitual intake of foods and nutrients. Two new versions\nwere developed for this survey: version C2 for children aged\n3\u201311 years designed for completion by a parent\/guardian\nwith help from the child, and version C3 for young people\naged 12\u201317 years for completion by the young person with\nhelp from their parent\/guardian. Version C2 lists 140 foods\nor drinks with a measure defined for each item, and version\nC3 includes six additional items covering intake of coffee\nand alcoholic drinks. Participants were asked to estimate the\nfrequency and amount of each food or drink consumed by\nselecting one of nine options, ranging from \u2018rarely or never\u2019\nto \u2018seven or more measures per day\u2019. The relative validity\nof the FFQ was assessed in a subgroup of the study population\nwho also completed a 4 d non-weighed diet diary(13).\nData were entered manually, and a 10 % check of the data\nentry found an error rate of 0\u00b74 %. FFQ items were divided\ninto thirty-three food or drink groups, modified slightly from\nthe Low-Income Diet and Nutrition Survey(15); in a few\ninstances, the grouping of foods on the FFQ led to minor\ndifferences in the definitions of these groups. Energy and\nnutrient intakes were estimated from an in-house calculation\npackage based on the Food Standards Agency National Diet\nand Nutrition Survey nutrient database, which uses the follow-\ning criteria to estimate NMES content of foods(16): all sugars\nin fresh fruit and vegetables are classified as intrinsic, and\nlactose, whether present in a milk product or not, is considered\na milk sugar. All sugars in fruit juices as well as table sugar,\nhoney and the sucrose, glucose and glucose syrups added to\nfoods are classified as extrinsic. Sugars naturally present in\nfoods that are canned, stewed, dried or used in preserves\nare classified to be half extrinsic and half intrinsic. Added\nsugars or syrup in preserves are classified as extrinsic sugars.\nSocio-economic status and overweight\nSocio-economic status was assessed using the 2006 Scottish\nindex of multiple deprivation, which is a measure of\nneighbourhood socio-economic status based on twenty-seven\nindicators from seven domains (income, housing, employ-\nment, health, crime, education and access to services)(17).\nMeasured weight and height were used to calculate BMI\n(kg\/m2), which was compared with the UK 1990 centile\ncharts(18). Overweight (but not obese) was defined as BMI\n$85th centile but ,95th centile, and obesity was defined as\nBMI $95th centile.\nL. F.

Weightings were calculated to take account\nof selection and non-response bias, and then these composite\nweights were adjusted to create a calibration weight(13).\nDifferences between children who had never been treated\nfor decay and those who had received treatment for decay\nwere assessed using the Pearson x 2 statistic for categorical\nvariables, which was corrected for the survey design(19), or\nusing a t-test for continuous variables.\nAfter excluding fifty-one (3 %) FFQ with more than ten\nmissing responses and seventy (5 %) FFQ with extreme\nenergy intakes (below the 2\u00b75 percentile or above the 97\u00b75 per-\ncentile of energy intake for the age groups 3\u20137, 8\u201311 and 12\u2013\n17 years), dietary data were available for 1391 children. Both\ndietary data and data on treatment for decay were available for\n1329 children. Sugar and food intakes expressed as g\/d were\nadjusted for total energy using the nutrient residual\nmethod(20), and sugar intakes were also expressed as a percen-\ntage of food energy assuming the energy content of 16 kJ\/g.\nThe food groups that were analysed for their association\nwith treatment for decay were those that contributed at least\n10 % to the intake of total sugars or NMES, and also crisps\nand savoury snacks. This analysis is based on both consumers\nand non-consumers of these foods. Sugar and food intakes\nwere categorised into tertiles of intake: T1 (lowest), T2\n(medium) and T3 (highest). Sugar and food intakes are\nreported to one decimal place, although a second decimal\nplace was used to define cut-offs for tertiles.\nLogistic regression was used to compute crude and adjusted\nOR (95 % CI) for each tertile of intake, using the lowest tertile\nof intake as the reference group. A model for the risk of treat-\nment for decay was developed using stepwise regression to\nevaluate the effects of including the variables which were\nsignificantly different between children who had never been\ntreated for decay and those who had received treatment for\ndecay: age (at interview), ethnicity, BMI classification, Scottish\nindex of multiple deprivation quintile, type of teeth (milk or\nsecond teeth), age of first attendance at the dentist, reason for\nthe first visit to the dentist, treatment to stop decay (painting\nand\/or sealing), treatment from an orthodontist, age when first\nbrushed teeth first, frequency of tooth brushing, type of tooth-\npaste, ever visited a dental surgery, whether had false teeth\nand use of fluoride supplements. Variables with P.0\u00b71 from\nthe Wald test for significance were removed from the model.\nResults\nSubject characteristics\nThe children were aged between 3 and 17 years at interview.\nThe majority (97 %) of children were white, and 51 % were\nmale. Of the children, 14 % were classified as overweight\n(but not obese), and 17 % were obese. Most of the children\n(97 %) had attended the dentist at least once. At age 3\u20137\nyears, 94 % of the children had attended the dentist, and this\nproportion rose to 99 % by age 12\u201317 years.\nTreatment for decay\nOver half (56 %) of all children had reported receiving\ntreatment for decay. Almost a third (31 %) had had fillings\nbut no teeth extracted due to decay, 7 % had had teeth\nextracted due to decay but no fillings, and another 17 % had\nhad both fillings and teeth extracted due to decay.\nChildren who reported that they had been treated for decay\nwere more likely to be older (P,0\u00b7001), overweight or obese\n(P\u00bc0\u00b7031), from more deprived areas (P,0\u00b7001), and to have\ntheir second (or adult) teeth (P,0\u00b7001) compared with chil-\ndren who reported that they had never received treatment\nfor decay (Table 1). In addition, those who had been treated\nfor decay were more likely to have been older when they\nfirst attended the dentist (P,0\u00b7001), to have attended the den-\ntist for the first time because of trouble with their teeth\n(P,0\u00b7001), and to have received other dental treatment such\nas painting and\/or sealing (P,0\u00b7001) and orthodontics\n(P\u00bc0\u00b7015). Tooth brushing habits were also associated with\ntreatment for decay: those who reported that they had been\ntreated for decay were older when they first brushed their\nteeth (P,0\u00b7001), and less likely to brush their teeth at least\ntwice a day (P,0\u00b7001). Most of the children (97 %) reported\nusing a fluoride toothpaste, while only 0\u00b73 % of all children\nreported taking fluoride supplements. All children who\nreported taking fluoride supplements also reported using a\nfluoride toothpaste.\nFrequency of tooth brushing\nTooth brushing frequency differed significantly by age, sex\nand Scottish index of multiple deprivation quintile\n(P,0\u00b7001 for all). Younger children were more likely to\nreport brushing their teeth frequently (at least twice a day)\nthan older children (76 % in 3\u20137 year olds, 68 % in 8\u201311\nyear olds, and 63 % in 12\u201317 year olds), and girls were\nmore likely to report brushing their teeth frequently than\nboys (74 v. 63 %). Children in the least deprived Scottish\nindex of multiple deprivation quintile were also more likely\nto report brushing their teeth frequently (80 %) compared\nwith children in the most deprived quintile (55 %). Frequency\nof tooth brushing also differed by NMES intake: 76 % of chil-\ndren in the lowest tertile of intake (#14\u00b78 % food energy)\nreported brushing their teeth frequently compared with 65 %\nof children in the highest tertile of intake ( $20\u00b70 % food\nenergy) (P\u00bc0\u00b7003).\nIntakes of sugar and significant food sources of non-milk\nextrinsic sugars and risk of treatment for decay\nTable 2 shows the crude and adjusted OR for the risk of\nhaving had treatment for decay (based on self-report) associ-\nated with sugar intake. Total sugar intake, as either g\/d or %\nfood energy, was not significantly associated with having\nhad treatment for decay. In contrast, NMES intake signifi-\ncantly increased the risk of having had treatment for decay,\nalthough OR were much attenuated following adjustment for\npotential confounding factors: adjusted OR 1\u00b784 (95 % CI\n1\u00b728, 2\u00b764) for the highest ( $20\u00b70 % food energy) v. lowest\n(#14\u00b78 % food energy) intake. Sucrose intake also signifi-\ncantly increased the risk of having had treatment for decay\nSugar intake and dental decay in children 1557\nB\nri\nti\nsh\nJo\nu\nrn\nal\no\nf\nN\nu\ntr\nit\nio\nn\n(adjusted OR 1\u00b754, 95 % CI 1\u00b708, 2\u00b719) for the highest v.\nlowest intake (as percentage of food energy). In contrast,\nthe highest intakes of intrinsic and milk sugars, fructose and\nlactose were significantly associated with a reduced risk\nof having had treatment for decay. Glucose and maltose\nintakes were not significantly associated with risk following\nadjustment (Table 2).\nThe main contributors to NMES intake in this population\nwere non-diet soft drinks (23 %); confectionery (15 %);\nbiscuits, cakes and pastries (13 %); yogurt and fromage\nfrais (10 %); and fruit juice (including smoothies) (10 %).\nThe main sources of total sugars were whole fruit (16 %);\nnon-diet soft drinks (15 %); confectionery (10 %); and milk\nand cream (10 %). Of these food groups, only non-diet soft\ndrinks and confectionery were positively associated with the\nrisk of having had treatment for decay (Table 3). Children\nin the highest tertile of confectionery intake had double\nthe risk compared with those in the lowest tertile of intake\n(adjusted OR 1\u00b797, 95 % CI 1\u00b739, 2\u00b778). In addition,\nchildren with the medium or highest intake of crisps and\nsavoury snacks were at significantly raised risk of having\nhad treatment for decay compared with individuals with the\nlowest intake (P\u00bc0\u00b7006 for trend).\nFruit juice intake was significantly inversely associated\nwith the risk of having had treatment for decay: adjusted\nOR 0\u00b755 (95 % CI 0\u00b737, 0\u00b780) for the highest v. the lowest\ntertile of intake (Table 3). Similarly, children with both the\nmedium and highest intakes of milk and cream were at signifi-\ncantly reduced risk of having received treatment for\ndecay compared with children in the lowest tertile of intake.\nTable 1.

Compared with children who\nreported brushing their teeth frequently and had the lowest\nNMES intake (#14\u00b78 % food energy), children who reported\nbrushing their teeth once a day or less and had the highest\nNMES intake ($20\u00b70 % food energy) were at a threefold\nrisk of having received treatment for decay (adjusted\nOR 3\u00b739; 95 % CI 1\u00b797, 5\u00b782). Although frequent tooth brush-\ning attenuated the risk associated with the highest NMES\nintakes, children who reported brushing their teeth frequently\nwere still at increased risk of having had treatment for decay if\nthey were in the highest tertile of NMES intake (adjusted\nOR 1\u00b767; 95 % CI 1\u00b709, 2\u00b755).\nDiscussion\nIntakes of NMES and sucrose were positively associated with\nthe risk of having received treatment for decay, as were intakes\nof non-diet soft drinks and confectionery, which were the\nlargest contributors to NMES intake. The lack of association\nbetween total sugar intake and having received treatment for\ndecay, but clear association with NMES intake, supports\nearlier reports indicating that NMES is the component of\nfoods which contributes to dental decay(2).\nOur finding that there was no association between total\nsugar intake and having had treatment for decay is consistent\nwith the finding from a previous UK study in 12-year-old\nTable 3.

Another systematic review of\nsugar consumption and dental caries in countries where\nthere is \u2018moderate-to-extensive\u2019 fluoride exposure found that\nof thirty-six papers that scored .55 out of 100 on the evi-\ndence tables, only two papers found a \u2018strong relationship\u2019\nbetween sugar intake and caries development, sixteen papers\nfound a \u2018moderate relationship\u2019 and eighteen papers found a\n\u2018weak-to-no relationship\u2019(24).\nThe positive association between crisps and savoury snacks\nand having had treatment for dental decay is supported by an\nEnglish study, which found a strong correlation between crisp\nconsumption and the number of decayed, missing or filled\nteeth(25). Although crisps and savoury snacks contribute less\nthan 1 % to NMES intake(13), sticky\/chewy foods leave residue\non teeth that prolongs exposure to carbohydrate and results in\na lower oral pH(26). The severity of processing undergone\nby these snack foods and the type of flavouring agents with\nwhich they are coated may also influence the cariogenicity\nof these snacks, with certain varieties of crisps being almost\nas cariogenic as semi-sweet biscuits(27). In addition, children\nwho consume crisps and savoury snacks may be likely to\nconsume them with non-diet soft drinks (Spearman\u2019s r 0\u00b719,\nP,0\u00b7001) that are rich in sugar.\nThere were significant inverse associations between intakes\nof intrinsic and milk sugars, lactose, milk and cream and\nhaving had treatment for dental decay. Care should be taken\nwhen interpreting these associations as they may be partly\ndue to the inverse correlation between NMES and intrinsic\nand milk sugars (Spearman\u2019s r 20\u00b736, P,0\u00b7001) and lactose\n(Spearman\u2019s r 20\u00b721, P,0\u00b7001), i.e. individuals with the\nhighest NMES intakes are likely to have the lowest intakes\nof intrinsic and milk sugars. However, the inverse association\nwith intrinsic and milk sugars remained after adjusting for\nNMES intake (data not shown). Milk and milk products are\nalkaline and contain calcium, phosphates and protein which\nmay aid remineralisation of dental enamel following exposure\nto reduced pH(26). Nevertheless, most yogurts and fromage\nfrais should not be considered as protective against dental\ndecay due to their added sugar content, which accounted for\n10 % of total NMES intake(13).\nThere was no significant association between whole fruit\nintake and treatment for decay after adjusting for potential\nconfounding factors, which supports the recommendation\nthat foods rich in NMES be replaced with fresh fruit and\nvegetables(2). The inverse association with fruit juice (including\nsmoothies) is surprising given that fruit juice contributes\nabout 10 % to NMES intake(13); therefore, this finding\nshould be interpreted with caution. There was no significant\ndifference in NMES intake between the lowest and highest\ntertiles of fruit juice intake; therefore, it is likely that fruit\njuice intake is correlated with other dietary factors or beha-\nviours that influence risk of dental caries. For example, fruit\njuice consumption was significantly inversely correlated with\nconsumption of non-diet soft drinks (Spearman\u2019s r 20\u00b710,\nP,0\u00b7001) and crisps and savoury snacks (Spearman\u2019s\nr 20\u00b720, P,0\u00b7001), and positively correlated with milk and\ncream (Spearman\u2019s r 0\u00b707, P\u00bc0\u00b7016) and yogurt and fromage\nfrais (Spearman r 0\u00b712, P,0\u00b7001).\nAlthough frequent tooth brushing attenuated the risk associ-\nated with the highest NMES intakes, children who reported\nbrushing their teeth frequently were still at increased risk of\nhaving received treatment for decay if they had the highest\nNMES intakes. Similarly, the National Diet and Nutrition\nSurvey of children aged 1\u00b75\u20134\u00b75 years carried out during\n1992\u20133 found that the benefits of tooth brushing did not\noutweigh the detrimental effect of frequent sugar consump-\ntion(28). The benefits of tooth brushing are usually attributed\nto the use of fluoride toothpastes rather than the act of brush-\ning(29). The majority (97 %) of children in this survey used a\nfluoride toothpaste, and it is likely that the protective effect\nassociated with frequent tooth brushing is due to the fluoride\nrather than to brushing alone.\nThe benefits of fluoride result mainly from its topical effect,\ni.e. direct contact with the teeth(30). Fluoride present in saliva or\nin contact with teeth from toothpaste inhibits bacterial enzymes\nthat produce acid in plaques, and aids remineralisation of\nthe enamel(31). Total fluoride intake depends on the fluoride\nconcentration in the water supplies; however, within Scotland,\nthere are no fluoridated areas except for a small pocket of\nnaturally fluoridated water in rural Morayshire(32).

In particular, (i) the frequency of consumption,\n(ii) the consumption of NMES or NMES-rich foods just\nbefore bedtime and (iii) the placement of NMES-rich foods\nwithin a meal may have influenced our observed associa-\ntions, and this information was not captured by the FFQ.\nThe frequency of eating confectionery and sugary foods was\npositively associated with caries in 12-year-old English\nschoolchildren(21), and in a recent review, frequency of\nsugar consumption was significantly associated with dental\ncaries in nineteen of thirty-one studies(23). The consumption\nof sugary foods and drinks just before bedtime has also been\nassociated with caries prevalence(28,33,34). During sleep, the\nsalivary flow rate is negligible, and the protective effects of\nsaliva (e.g. its buffering effect and antibacterial action) are\nlost(1,35,36). Therefore, ideally the hour before bedtime\nshould be a sugar-free time(33), and the most important time\nto brush teeth is just before bedtime(35). In addition, the pos-\nition of the NMES-rich food within a meal can influence the\nfall in plaque pH(37) and may therefore influence caries risk.\nThe greatest benefit is thought to occur when \u2018sugary\u2019 and\n\u2018non-sugary\u2019 foods are consumed together, or when the\nsugary food is sandwiched between non-sugary foods(37).\nThe present study is based on self-reported treatment for\ndecay, and the results were not validated by access to dental\ncase notes. Nevertheless, evidence exists to support the value\nof dental self-reported measures in epidemiological studies,\nwith a high level of concordance found between child and\nparent\/guardian reporting, and positive correlations found\nbetween children\u2019s self-report and clinically measured oral\nhealth(38). However, societal pressure may influence parental\nreporting of frequency of tooth brushing, with a larger percen-\ntage of parents reporting that their child \u2018brushes twice or\nmore per day\u2019 than the children(38).\nInformation was not collected on the level of decay, such as\nthe number of fillings or the number of teeth removed due to\ndecay. Therefore, we could not differentiate between children\nwith one filling and children with many fillings or many teeth\nremoved due to decay. Additionally, it should be noted that\nuntreated caries may be present in some of the children, and\ntherefore the present study could only assess the risk of\nhaving received treatment for decay rather than the risk of\ndecay itself. Information was also not collected on whether\nchildren were left to brush their teeth themselves, i.e. without\nparental\/guardian supervision, which has been associated with\ncaries prevalence(28).\nThe cross-sectional nature of this survey makes it difficult to\ndraw conclusions regarding cause and effect, and the harmful\neffects of NMES may even be underestimated. For example,\ncurrent dental status may reflect earlier dietary patterns, and chil-\ndren with untreated dental caries may limit their sugar intake due\nto pain. Ideally, prospective studies are required to assess the\ninfluence of diet and lifestyle on the development of caries.\nAlthough the association between NMES intake and dental\nhealth was highlighted in the 1989 report \u2018Dietary sugars and\nhuman disease\u2019(2), and the recommendation that the popu-\nlation average intake should not exceed 10 % of total energy\nwas published in 1991(12), the little evidence available on\ntrends in NMES consumption in UK children suggests that\nNMES intake has not changed much in the last 20 years,\nand may even be increasing. Mean NMES intakes in 11\u201312-\nyear-old Northumbrian children were estimated to be 15\u00b70 %\nenergy in 1980, 16\u00b79 % energy in 1990 and 16\u00b71 % energy in\n2000(39). The National Diet and Nutrition Survey of young\npeople aged 4\u201318 years estimated mean NMES intakes to\nbe 16\u00b77 % of food energy in boys and 16\u00b74 % of food energy\nin girls in 1997(40), which are slightly lower than the estimated\nintake of 17\u00b74 % of food energy in both boys and girls aged\n3\u201317 years in Scotland in 2006(13).\nHigh intakes of NMES may also have implications for\ndiseases other than dental caries, particularly for the present\nobesity epidemic, by contributing to the excess energy con-\nsumption responsible for obesity development. For example,\ngreater consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, which\nare the largest contributors to NMES intake (23 % in the\npresent study), has been associated with weight gain and\nobesity in both adults and children(41).\nThe recommended intake for NMES of less than 10 % of\ntotal energy (11 % of food energy) in children was originally\nintended to be achieved in 2005, though the time scale was\nlater extended to 2010. It is unlikely that the NMES target\nwill be met, given that the mean intake in 2006 was 17\u00b74 %\nfood energy(13). Although removing all non-diet soft drinks\nfrom the diet and replacing the energy by increasing the\nintake of fruit and vegetables will lead to some reduction in\nNMES intake (based on the mean intakes of the group),\nconsumption of confectionery, biscuits, cakes, pastries, yogurt\nand fromage frais would have to decrease and intake of starchy\nfoods would have to increase before the recommendation for\nNMES intake is met in children in Scotland(42).\nWithin Scotland, an action plan was introduced in 2005\nfor improving dental health with targets set for 5 year olds\nand 11\/12 year olds in 2010(43). The action plan had a particu-\nlar focus on improving the oral health of children, including\nextension of tooth brushing schemes to primary schools with\nthe poorest oral health records and promotion of oral health\nin secondary schools. Targets for older children are lacking,\nand prevention of caries in children aged under 5 years\nshould also be a priority as a recent report published by\nthe Audit Commission(44) highlighted a widening gap in the\nmean number of decayed, missing and filled teeth per\n5-year-old child between those living in deprived communities\nand those living in the rest of England.\nThe highest grades of recommendations for primary preven-\ntion of caries are for (1) dental health education advice, (2) brush-\ning teeth twice a day using a toothpaste with at least 1000 ppm\nfluoride and (3) application and maintenance of sealants in\ntooth pits or fissures (grade A) rather than changing dietary\nintake (grades B and C)(1). However, the present study suggests\nthat increasing the frequency of tooth brushing, while reducing\nthe risk of developing caries, will not compensate for a high\nintake of NMES. Therefore, to improve dental health in children,\ndental health strategies must continue to stress the importance of\nboth good oral hygiene and reduced NMES intake.\nAcknowledgements\nG. McN., L. F.
