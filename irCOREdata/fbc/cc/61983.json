Introduction\n[2] The 26 December 2004 Sumatra-Andaman earth-\nquake (9.0\u20139.3 Mw) and the resultant tsunami was one of\nthe worst modern, natural disasters. It prompted govern-\nments and international agencies to reevaluate the likeli-\nhood, and consequences, of similar events occurring\nelsewhere [Kanamori, 2006]. The risk to the United King-\ndom (and more generally to coasts surrounding the north-\nwest European seaboard) was assessed in a study [Kerridge\net al., 2005] that concluded the probability of any such\nevent is very low. However, there is historical and geolog-\nical evidence of tsunamis reaching northern European\nshores [e.g., Smith et al., 2004; Dawson et al., 2000] so\nthe possibility of future events affecting low-lying popula-\ntions in this region cannot be dismissed. This paper inves-\ntigates the hazard to the United Kingdom associated with a\ntsunami similar to that generated by the Lisbon 1755\nearthquake. We consider the effects of topographic steering\nfor this scenario, the regions of energy dissipation, and the\nimplications for tsunamis on broad shelves elsewhere.\n[3] We select the Azores-Gibraltar fault zone (AGFZ) as\nthe source region, since this was the source of the tsunami in\n1755 which (along with the earthquake) destroyed the city\nof Lisbon [see, e.g., Baptista et al., 1998a]. It was also the\nsource of the well-documented 1969 (7.9 Mw) earthquake\n[Fukao, 1973]; small-amplitude (0.2 m) waves with tsunami\nperiodicities were recorded at Newlyn, United Kingdom,\nfollowing that event [Dawson et al., 2000]. Similar waves\nwere recorded at Newlyn after earthquakes west of Portugal\nin 1941 (8.2 Ms), and 1975 (7.9 Ms). Kerridge et al. [2005]\nconcluded that this region is the most probable source for a\nmajor North Atlantic tsunami. There is, of course, geolog-\nical evidence of a major tsunami impacting the northern\ncoastline of the United Kingdom following the Storrega\nsubmarine landslide approximately 8000 years ago [e.g.,\nBondevik et al., 1997; Smith et al., 2004], but it is widely\nthought that the marine deposition required for any repeat\noccurrence could only accrue during a glacial period [Rise\net al., 2005].\n[4] Following the Lisbon earthquake of 1 November\n1755 there were reports of tsunami waves as high as 10 m\nalong the coasts of Portugal, Spain, and Morocco [Baptista\net al., 1998a] and there is one account of 3 m waves\nreaching Cornwall in the United Kingdom [Borlase,\n1755]. Although the historical data is summarized by\nBaptista et al. [1998a], locating the epicenter of the 1755\nearthquake is difficult. Conflicting information regarding\nthe distribution of intensities, origin time, and tsunami\narrivals [Johnston, 1996; Mendes et al., 1999], and the\ndiffuse distribution of earthquakes along this part of the\nAGFZ [Zitellini et al., 2001], lead to large uncertainties, and\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 113, C04007, doi:10.1029\/2007JC004425, 2008\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory, Liverpool, UK.\n2British Geological Survey, Edinburgh, UK.\n3HR Wallingford, Wallingford, UK.\nPublished in 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.\nC04007 1 of 15\nthe range of possible epicenters spans around 500 km (see\nFigure 1b). Modeling of both the tsunami [Baptista et al.,\n1998b] and earthquake intensity [Johnston, 1996] has been\nused to estimate the location and the size of the source.\nDetailed geophysical surveying in the eastern section of the\nAGFZ has taken place [Zitellini et al., 1999, 2001], but no\nsingle location has been implicated. This is not surprising\nsince even for the better observed 28 February 1969\ntsunami, neither direct numerical simulation [Gjevik et al.,\n1997] or adjoint methods using observations [Pires and\nMiranda, 2001] were able to determine unique source\nparameters.\n[5] Since the exact source of the 1755 earthquake remains\nunknown we consider three possible fault orientations and\nlocations, which we discuss in section 2. Source dimensions\nand average slip are derived from realistic assumptions of\nthe earthquake magnitude and empirical relationships for\nthe source scaling of intraplate earthquakes. We do not\nconsider the subduction model of Gutscher [2004] since\nthere is significant evidence against subduction [e.g., Stich\net al., 2005]. Composite source models [e.g., Vilanova et\nal., 2003] are also excluded. It is not the intention of this\npaper to explore the relative merits of the various postulated\nsources for the 1755 tsunami; rather, we use the historical\ninformation as a first-order check on model performance in\norder to explore the hazards and oceanographic implications\nassociated with this scenario.\n2. Source Strength and Location\n[6] Estimates of the magnitude of the 1755 earthquake\ngenerally vary between 8.5 and 9.0 Mw. Johnston [1996]\nused isoseismals to determine the moment magnitude,\nfinding a best fit of 8.7 \u00b1 0.39 Mw. In this study we select\nlower and upper estimates as 8.3 and 8.7 Mw, respectively,\non the basis of Abe [1979]. We assume that the 1755\nearthquake ruptured the entire seismogenic zone (between\n60 km depth and the surface). With a fault dip of about 50\u0001\n[Fukao, 1973] this means that a realistic fault width is\n60 km\/(sin 50\u0001), or about 75 km. We assume an intraplate\ntectonic setting [Johnston, 1996] and propose three plausi-\nble models for fault orientations and locations. Scaling\nrelationships for intraplate earthquakes imply larger slip\ncompared to interplate earthquakes of the same dimensions\n[Scholz et al., 1986; Scholz, 2002]. The models are\ndescribed below and their physical source dimensions are\ngiven in Table 1. The various locations can be found in\nFigure 1a.\n[7] Model A has the same epicenter as the 1969 earth-\nquake in the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain, to the southeast of\nthe Gorringe Bank [Fukao, 1973]. The origin of this\nearthquake is reasonably well understood. It has a thrust\nmechanism on a fault plane that dips to the north and is\nrelated to the tectonic uplift of the Gorringe Bank. The fault\norientation is favorable to compression in northwest-southeast\ndirection. The model provides a good fit for the macro-\nseismic data; the Horseshoe Fault is an active tectonic\nfeature; and there is significant seismic activity in this area.\nHowever, Baptista et al. [1998b] suggest that sources\nanalogous to the 1969 earthquake do not reproduce the\nobserved distribution of wave heights and traveltimes along\nthe Iberian coast for the 1755 event.\n[8] Model B is an earthquake north of the Gorringe Bank\nas suggested by Johnston [1996], occurring on a thrust fault\nthat dips to the south and is related to the tectonic uplift of\nthe bank. This is similar to the top hat model of Gjevik et al.\n[1997], which assumes uplift of the Gorringe Bank ridge as\na source although there is evidence (N. Zitellini, unpub-\nlished data, 2005) to suggest that it is inactive. As a fault\nplane solution we used the south dipping auxiliary plane of\nthe Fukao [1973] model for the 1969 event. Model C is\nequivalent to the N160 model of Baptista et al. [1998b].\nThe source location is closer to the Iberian shore than either\nof the other models, between the Gorringe Bank and the\nedge of the continental shelf west of Cape San Vicente. The\nearthquake occurs on a thrust fault dipping to the northeast.\nBaptista et al. [1998b] found that this model produced\ntsunami arrival times that better matched the historical\nreports. However, the underlying tectonics of such a model\nare less well defined. The inclusion of this model allowed us\nto examine the effect of source orientation on tsunami\nwaves reaching the coastlines of the United Kingdom,\nIreland, and northwest Europe.\n[9] In each case, the sea bed displacement due to an\ninclined, rectangular fault was calculated using the well-\nknown analytical expressions of Okada [1985]. These\nformulae assume the Earth to be a homogeneous elastic half-\nspace and require the source parameters given in Table 1.\nWe have assumed the worst case of complete crustal rupture:\nsolutions with a specified focal depth would give smaller\ndisplacements. The sea floor deformations obtained were\nmapped directly onto the sea surface as shown in Figure 2.\nThere are deficiencies in this assumption, as pointed out by\nGjevik et al. [1997] who employed a nonhydrostatic model\nand showed that in certain circumstances the maximum\nsurface elevation can be 30% less than the displacement at\nthe sea bed. Neither can the surface deformation contain the\ndiscontinuity that is present at the precise line of a fault. Our\nmodeling scheme introduced the deformation as a sea\nsurface elevation and, in practice, the discontinuity was\nslightly smoothed because of regridding.\n3.

The widely used MOST\nmodel [Titov and Gonzalez, 1997] is of this type. Recent\ncomparisons of model predictions with reliable coastal\nobservations in the Sea of Japan [Choi et al., 2003] also\nshow that nested, finite difference, NLSW models produced\naccurate simulations of coastal inundation and runup. For\noptimum discretization, in this study we nested an unstruc-\ntured finite element model within a wide domain finite\ndifference model.\n3.1. Finite Difference Modeling\n[11] In order to best represent the tsunamis at their origin,\nas well as their subsequent evolution across the European\nShelf, we extended the U.K. operational storm surge model\n[Flather, 2000] to cover the region 20\u0001W to 13\u0001E, 30\u0001N to\n60\u0001N. The model solves the two-dimensional shallow water\nequations in finite difference form in spherical coordinates,\nwith a quadratic formulation for stress at the sea bed and\nradiation conditions at the open lateral boundaries. The\nresolution used here was 1\/30\u0001 latitude by 1\/20\u0001 longitude,\nresulting in an approximately 3.5 km horizontal grid that\nprovides effective discretization and avoids numerical dis-\npersion [Shuto, 1991; Kowalik, 2001]. The model integra-\ntions ran at a time step of 10 s for 12 h, by which time the\nwave train had passed the United Kingdom. Elevations and\nvelocity fields were archived every minute for subsequent\ndiagnostics. As well as examining maximum elevations and\ntsunami arrival times we studied wave energetics, making\nthe connection between the genesis region and the subse-\nquent modification of the wave as it propagates.\n3.2. Energetics\n[12] We derive an energy equation from the shallow water\ngoverning equations in spherical coordinates. The continu-\nity and momentum equations used in the model can be\nfound in the work of Flather [1976] and are written\nconcisely below. For completeness we retained the Coriolis\nand advective terms possessed by the model, although it is\nwell known that these terms are negligible for tsunamis.\nSimilarly, the tan 8 term arises from the transformation to\nspherical coordinates; it is numerically insignificant and is\nincluded only for mathematical exactness.\n@h\n@t\n\u00ferS \u0005 Hu\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 0 \u00f01\u00de\n@u\n@t\n\u00fe u \u0005 rSu\u00fe f \u00fe u\nR\ntanf\n\u0001 \u0002\nk \u0001 u \u00bc \u0002grSh\u00fe g\nH\nujuj \u00fe Ar2Su\n\u00f02\u00de\nwhere h is the elevation of the sea surface; rS \u0005 V = 1R cos8\n(\n@Vc\n@c +\n@\n@8 (V8 cos 8)) defines the horizontal divergence\noperator in spherical coordinates for a vector, V; H = h + h\nis the total depth of water; u is the horizontal velocity field;\nR is the radius of the Earth; f is the Coriolis parameter;rS C =\n( 1\nR cos 8\n@C\n@c,\n1\nR\n@C\n@8) defines the gradient operator for a scalar, C;\nc is eastward longitude, 8 is northward latitude; k is the unit\nradial vector; g is the acceleration due to gravity; g is a\ncoefficient of bottom friction, with a value of 0.0025; and\nA(H) is a depth-dependent horizontal eddy viscosity. In this\nstudy, where unresolved eddy motions are not relevant, the\nrole of the final term in equation (2) is simply to suppress\nnumerical noise at smaller scales.\n[13] The energy equation is found by taking the scalar\nproduct of (2) with u. After some manipulation, this gives\nthe flux form of the energy equation:\n@E\n@t\n\u00ferS \u0005 FE \u00bc rgjuj3 \u00fe r uH\u00f0 \u00de \u0005 Ar2Su \u00f03\u00de\nwhere r is density, E = r(HK + 1\n2\ngh2) is the total energy per\nunit horizontal area; K = 1\n2\njuj2 is the kinetic energy density;\nand FE = ruH(K + gh) is the total energy flux per unit\nlength normal to the flux. Although we have derived the\nexpression from the governing equations, the energy flux\nterm, FE, is identical to the time-mean form arising from\nlinear theory that has been widely used in the study of tidal\nenergy fluxes [e.g., Davies and Kwong, 2000]. We find that\ntime integrals of FE have only a very small contribution\nfrom the kinetic energy component, of the order 1% (in\nagreement with shallow water theory). The first term on the\nright-hand side of equation (3) represents dissipation from\nbottom friction, which we show is small but not insignif-\nicant in shallow water. The viscosity term (which arises\nfrom the parameterization of Reynolds stresses in the\nequations) was 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the main\nterms and is not considered further.\n[14] Equation (3) states that the rate of change of total\nenergy per unit horizontal area depends on the divergence of\nthe energy flux as well as dissipation from frictional\nprocesses. The energy flux itself would reveal the transfer\nof energy from one place to another, but not necessarily\nwhether the energy changes locally. It is only when this flux\ndiverges, for instance, when the flow interacts with topog-\nraphy, that the total energy changes locally. It is possible to\nshow that the energy flux divergence can be split into one\nterm containing the divergence of advected energy and\nanother containing the local gradient in bathymetry.\n[15] We inserted the six different source models shown in\nFigure 2 into the finite difference model and denoted these\nRuns A1\u2013C2. Each of these is a gridded version of the\nanalytical solution [Okada, 1985] of the seafloor distur-\nbance, and they explore the variation of epicenter, fault\norientation, and earthquake magnitude. The simulations\nincluded tides inherently, but tidal signals were removed\nfrom the following results. We found the dynamical inter-\naction between tides and tsunamis to be insignificant. The\nstate of the tide is obviously crucial when determining the\ntotal water level at coastal locations but, for the purposes of\nrisk assessment, tide and tsunami can be superimposed.\nEach scenario was also simulated with the finite element\nmodel, but only Run B2 is shown.\n3.3. Finite Element Modeling\n[16] To simulate the tsunami propagation to the shoreline\nit was necessary to develop a finer grid model of the United\nKingdom and Irish coasts. The waves simulated here had\ntypical periods of approximately 20 min, and it was bene-\nficial to use a variable grid model, allowing the number of\ncells per wavelength to remain approximately constant. This\nC04007 HORSBURGH ET AL.: LISBON-TYPE TSUNAMI IMPACT ON THE UK\n5 of 15\nC04007\nvariable mesh was generated using the TELEMAC-2D\nhydrodynamic model [Galland et al., 1991; Hervouet,\n2000a]. This model has been extensively validated for tides\n[Malcherek, 2000; Sauvaget et al., 2000; Jones and Davies,\n2005] and wind-induced response [Jones and Davies, 2006]\nin shallow shelf seas. Its capacity to simulate runup well is\naided by a wetting-drying scheme that performs well at the\nfinest resolution [Jones and Davies, 2006]. In dam break\ntests the inundating flood wave celerity is accurate to 3%\n[Hervouet, 2000b], and numerical dispersion is minimal,\neven for highly distorted tidal estuaries [Malcherek, 2000].\n[17] The model mesh was set up using the spherical\ncoordinates option and, for consistency, the TELEMAC-\n2D runs used the same bathymetric data as the wide domain\nmodel. The inner domain was nested in the region indicated\nby the dashed line in Figure 1 and contained 46,000 nodes\nand 88,000 elements whose mesh size varied from 10 km at\nthe outer boundary to less than 1 km near to the United\nKingdom and Irish coasts. Radiation boundary conditions\nwere imposed on all open boundaries (to allow any outwardly\ndirected energy to leave the domain); the incident tsunami\nwas imposed as a time series of elevations and depth-\naveraged currents from the outer model at the southern and\nwestern boundaries. The simulation ran for 12 h after the\ninitial disturbance, and bed friction was represented as a\nNikuradse roughness length [e.g., Soulsby, 1998] of 0.01 m.\n4. Results\n[18] The contours of arrival time and maximum elevation\nobtained at each cell are shown in Figure 3 for the six runs,\nFigure 3.

The patterns of maximum elevation are different\nfor each variant of orientation\/location (A, B, and C),\nalthough the times of arrival are broadly similar. It is evident\nthat the precise nature of the seafloor perturbation is the\nlargest uncertainty in the effects of the tsunami. For exam-\nple, Run A2 (Figure 3b) has maximum elevation along a\nline normal to its fault line, northwestward into the North\nAtlantic and southeastward toward Africa, with little effect\non the shallow shelf seas to the north. Run B2 (Figure 3d)\nalso has maximum elevation along a line normal to the\nsource model fault line, which is now rotated slightly\nclockwise; this run has maximum elevations of up to 1 m\nfocused in beams in the Celtic Sea. In contrast, Run C2\n(Figure 3f), whose fault line is oriented almost normal to\nthat of Run B2, has maximum elevation along a line\nbetween Iberia and the mid-Atlantic. The lower-magnitude,\n8.3 Mw, scenarios (Figure 3, left) have a similar pattern to\nthe higher-magnitude, 8.7 Mw, scenarios (Figure 3, right),\nbut are typically 1\u20133 m near their source, compared to 3\u2013\n8 m for the latter. Kinks in the arrival time contours result\nfrom modification to the wave speed as it propagates over\ntopographic features.\n[19] Table 2 compares the arrival time of the modeled\nwaves with the best interpretation [Baptista et al., 1998a] of\nliterature describing the 1755 Lisbon tsunami. There are\ndifferences between each of the six scenarios, and these\ndifferences vary by location. For example, the \u2018\u2018observed\u2019\u2019\narrival time of 16 \u00b1 7 min at S. Vincente is well-matched by\nthe A and B runs, but not by the C runs, whose arrival time\nis much shorter. Our modeled arrival times agreed with\nthose of Baptista et al. [1998b], where the seismic assump-\ntions were similar, but like them we found that no single\nmodel run could reconcile apparently contradictory obser-\nvations. Our model is in broad agreement with the historical\ninformation (particularly along the Iberian coastline where\nreports were more likely to be accurate) and with previous\nattempts to numerically model the event. The sensitivity of\narrival time to the initial conditions is demonstrated with\nthese six runs. We make no further attempt to qualify the\nvarious sources but now concentrate on run B2 which\ndevelops the largest elevation amplitudes at the U.K.\ncontinental shelf break, and has the most significant impli-\ncations for hazard.\n[20] The evolution of the tsunami in Run B2 is shown in\nFigure 4 as a sequence of sea surface elevations. After 10 min\n(Figure 4a) the wave amplitude is typically greater than\n0.25 m and is still several meters in places. Our results are\nsimilar to those of Gjevik et al. [1997] who obtained a large\nprimary crest, followed by a weaker trough, in their simu-\nlations of the 1969 event. The complex shape of the\nevolving waves comes from the (primarily) gravitational\nadjustment of the initial condition. After 30 min (Figure 4b),\nthe first tsunami wave has reached the Iberian peninsula and\nwave crest refraction is evident. To the west, the wave crest has\nbecome discontinuous; to the north, wave amplitude remains\nlocally greater than 1.25 m. After 60 min (Figure 4c), the\nfirst positive tsunami wave has hit North Africa and the\nStrait of Gibraltar. The northernmost part of the wave crest\nis significantly refracted as it encounters the Galician Rise\n(see Figure 1a for location).\n[21] The leading wave reaches the U.K. shelf edge after\n120 min (Figure 4d), and it also refracts into the Bay of\nBiscay. Upon encountering the shallow shelf, the wave-\nlength reduces and the amplitude increases as the wave\nshoals. Local amplitudes are in the range 0.25 m to 1.25 m.\nComparison of the leading wave height at two points along\n8\u0001 W (one in 4000 m depth, the other 200 m) showed\napproximately a two-fold amplification. This agrees well\nwith a simple calculation of wave energy flux per unit wave\ncrest (Green\u2019s Law), which predicts amplification of (4000\/\n200)0.25, a factor of 2.1. As the tsunami propagates further\nacross the U.K. shelf into the Irish Sea, by 180 min\n(Figure 4e) an obvious cusp forms in the wave crest near\nthe Goban Spur. By 240 min (Figure 4f) the small-scale\nfeatures on the U.K. shelf have interacted with the wave to\ngive a diffraction-like pattern, which is consistent with the\nelevation maxima described previously (Figure 3d).\n[22] The finite element model run confirmed that scenario\nB2 had the most significant impact on the U.K. and Irish\ncoasts. Figure 5 shows the free surface elevation at 5 and\nthen 8 h after the initial disturbance. The finite element\nmodel produced the same beams of maximum elevation,\nconfirming the results of the finite difference model and\ngiving confidence in the physical nature of the phenome-\nnon. Wave amplitudes of 0.5\u20131.0 m were observed in the\nfinite element model once the tsunami passed onto the\ncontinental shelf, but before it encountered very shallow\nwater. The traveltime of the primary wave to the southwest\ntip of the United Kingdom was 264 min, similar to the\n268 min of Baptista et al. [1998b]. The wave period at this\npoint was found to be approximately 20 min which is\nconsistent with the anecdotal reports of Borlase [1755].\nFigure 5b shows that after 8 h there is still much energy in\nthe system, and a confused sea surface has resulted from\ncomplex reflections and interactions in shallow water. This\nregional ringing and slow decay of energy was also\nobserved by Fine et al. [2005] during their simulations of\na tsunami entering Canada\u2019s Burin inlet. The near-coast\nmaximum elevations are shown in Figure 6a. The effects of\nthe tsunami locally are due to focusing mechanisms and\nlocal reamplification, determined by the resonances of\ndifferent bays and inlets. The majority of the south coast\nof Ireland, and a large part the Cornish coast in the\nsouthwest of the United Kingdom, recorded elevations in\nexcess of 1 m at some time during the model run, and\nseveral locations had maxima exceeding 3.5 m. To show the\nvery local nature of these effects, wave maxima were\nextracted along a coastal perimeter segment and are shown\nin Figure 6b.\nTable 2.

These two sensitivity experiments complement\neach other in that different length scales were considered,\nand the bathymetric adjustments were applied in regions of\ncontrasting depth. The run with smoothed shelf edge\nbathymetry no longer has beams of high maximum eleva-\ntion (Figure 8a), but instead the maximum elevation\ndecreases uniformly as the wave passes over the continental\nshelf, until reamplification occurs in the very nearshore.\nAlso note the uniformity of the arrival time contours on the\nshelf, because the tsunami now approaches as a plane wave.\nThere is a separate beam of maximum elevation originating\nfrom the Goban Spur, where constructive interference\nbetween the two wavefronts still occurs. Figure 8b shows\nthe maximum elevations from the computation with the\nGalician Rise removed. There is now a region of substan-\ntially increased maximum elevation, typically 0.7 m to 1 m,\ncompared to the results in Figure 3d. This increased wave\nheight eventually impacts on the U.K. shelf, amplifying the\npattern of beams seen in the original run.\n[24] The maximum elevation is a useful diagnostic for\nstudying the potential impacts of the tsunami, but does not\ncontain detailed information about the path or transforma-\ntion of the wave. The time-mean energy flux, however,\nshows how the energy spreads from the tsunamigenic region\nand is guided through the system. For periodic processes it\nFigure 4. Sequence of snapshots of sea surface elevation (m) for Run B2: (a) 10 min; (b) 30 min;\n(c) 60 min; (d) 120 min; (e) 180 min; (f) 240 min.\nC04007 HORSBURGH ET AL.: LISBON-TYPE TSUNAMI IMPACT ON THE UK\n8 of 15\nC04007\nis usual to average equation (3) over at least one wave\nperiod; in the case of a tsunami propagating over a large\ndistance the time bounds are not easily defined so we chose\nto average over 4 h, by which time the primary wave train\nhas passed the U.K. shelf break. For Run B2 (Figure 9a)\nthere was an asymmetrical energy flux in directions normal\nto the fault line and thence northwestward into the North\nAtlantic: a path with deeper bathymetry and fewer sea-\nmounts. Also, there was intensification of the energy flux\nover the Galician Rise and over the continental shelf in the\nCeltic Sea. This shows how the bathymetry acts as a\nwaveguide, and also the energetic consequences resulting\nfrom interference due to shelf edge irregularities. As can be\nseen from equation (3), energy evolution at a point is\ncontrolled by the convergence of energy flux and dissipa-\ntion (in shallow water). Figures 9b and 9c show how over\nthe continental shelf, but away from the near-coast regions,\nthe convergence term dominates the balance, with the\nfrictional dissipation being an order of magnitude smaller.\n[25] The time-averaged convergence of energy flux is an\nexcellent indicator of those regions most important for trans-\nformations to the tsunami. The convergence (Figure 9b)\nis negative in the genesis region, where the time-mean\npotential energy has been reduced. There is positive con-\nvergence of energy flux along the axis normal to the fault\nline, which is consistent with the snapshots in Figure 4,\nwhere one can see the wavefront propagate in this direction.\nAway from the genesis region, there are finer-scale features\nin the energy flux convergence pattern, near Madeira, and\non the U.K. continental shelf. Here, the patterns of positive\nand negative flux convergence are aligned in the same\ndirection as the beams of maximum elevation. The same\ninterference pattern is seen in the frictional dissipation\n(Figure 9c) which is relatively large on the shelf break\ncompared to elsewhere. To compare the temporal flux of\nenergy at the shelf break with that closer to the shoreline,\nFigure 9d shows time series of the total energy per unit area\naveraged over the blue box (shelf break) and green box\n(inshore) marked on Figure 1a. The energy plot for the\nnearshore (green line) shows a factor of 2 amplification due\nto focusing effects, persists for several hours, and exhibits\nmultiple peaks due to interference.\n[26] For the run with a smoothed shelf edge the removal\nof topographic irregularities altered the interference pattern\nseen in the standard run, replacing it with a region of more\nuniform energy flux as shown in Figure 10a. Most of the\nenergy flux convergence (Figure 10b) is now concentrated\non the shelf edge without the multiple features seen in the\nstandard run. It is important to note that even when the\ntopographic irregularities are removed, the areas of maxi-\nmum wave modification and energy dissipation are still\nsome distance offshore. This is in contrast to the Iberian\npeninsula where the absence of a broad shelf means that\nmodification is confined to a narrow coastal strip. In this\nway the wider continental shelf to the north provides a\nmeasure of protection by ensuring that significant energy\ntransformations occur before the tsunami reaches the coast.\nFigure 10d shows that the energy flux time series across the\ntwo indicator regions is little altered when the shelf break is\nsmoothed. The small-scale bathymetry may affect the pat-\ntern of interactions (Figure 10a) but it does not have any\nsignificant impact on the average shoreward energy transfer.\n[27] Figure 11 illustrates the energy diagnostics when the\nGalician Rise was artificially removed. There is a reduction\nin flux magnitude where the Galician Rise once was,\nimplying a focusing role for this feature in the standard\nrun. The path of the energy flux is now more northward\ntoward the U.K. shelf where the beams of energy flux\n(Figure 11a) have higher values than the previous runs\n(Figures 9a and 10a). This was confirmed by the energy\ntime series (Figure 11d) where the peak energy arriving in\nthe Bristol Channel increased by 20%, although paradoxi-\ncally the flux of energy across the shelf break box was\nreduced. The Galician Rise therefore appears to protect the\nU.K. coastline from this scenario of tsunami impact in a\ncomplex way, through changing the flux convergence\npattern in such a way that wave energy is more focused\nover that part of the shelf capable of reflecting and dissi-\npating energy more efficiently.\n5. Discussion\n[28] We have examined six initial condition scenarios of\ntsunamis emanating from the Azores-Gibraltar Fault Zone\nand moving toward the northwest European continental\nshelf. The scenarios were guided by our best knowledge\nof the Lisbon tsunami of 1 November 1755, but the prime\nintention of this study was to explore the consequences and\nimpacts in this region of such an event. As has been found\npreviously [e.g., Baptista et al., 1998b; Mader, 2001],\nmodeling historical tsunami events is difficult as there is\nFigure 5. Surface elevation (m) in the inner finite element\nmodel, (a) 5 h and (b) 8 h after the disturbance for Run B2.\nC04007 HORSBURGH ET AL.: LISBON-TYPE TSUNAMI IMPACT ON THE UK\n9 of 15\nC04007\nusually a lack of trustworthy observations against which to\nverify. Our simulations illustrated several important aspects\nof interaction between a Lisbon-type tsunami and the\ntopography of the northern European seaboard. We found\nthat the impact of a 1755 type tsunami on northwest\nEuropean shelf seas would be very sensitive to the location,\norientation and magnitude of the initial seafloor deforma-\ntion, with only one of our source models (B2) having any\nnotable consequences. It is well known [e.g., Titov et al.,\n2001] that the faulting location and the magnitude and\nextent of the seafloor displacement are the most important\nsource parameters for determining the scale of far field\neffects. The subsequent wave evolution in our simulations\nwas also sensitive to bathymetry, as has been shown\npreviously by ray tracing studies [e.g., Satake, 1988] and\nby numerical modeling [e.g., Titov et al., 2005]. In their\nglobal simulation of the 26 December 2004 Sumatra tsuna-\nmi, Titov et al. [2005] found that wave directionality for that\nevent was primarily controlled by source characteristics in\nthe near field, and by topographic steering in the far field\n(where considerable amplification along ocean ridges was\nevident). Our results suggest that, for some events at least,\nthere are scales at which these two primary controlling factors\ninteract. The snapshots of surface elevation (Figure 4e)\nshow that the primary wave refracts around the Goban\nSpur, after which the two wavefronts interact with smaller\ntopographic features producing beams of intensified eleva-\ntion and wave energy flux on the U.K. shelf. These beams\nwere present in both the finite difference and the higher-\nresolution finite element models.\n[29] The maximum elevations obtained were approxi-\nmately 3.5 m along the Cornish coast, but in the majority\nof places, maximum elevation was less than 1 m. These\nelevations are comparable to winter storm surge conditions,\nbut unlike surge conditions there is extreme variability in\nthe tsunami wave height from one location to another.\nExtreme sea levels resulting from this simulation (which\nrepresents the likely worst case for the United Kingdom),\ncombined with both mean high-water spring (MHWS) and\nmean high-water neap (MHWN) tides, were calculated and\ncompared with the 1:100 return level produced by Dixon\nand Tawn [1997]. The maximum elevations exceeded the\n1:100 year extreme sea level only at three locations on the\nCornish peninsula, and then only during MHWS tides.\nElsewhere (and everywhere under MHWN conditions) the\ntsunami produced elevations similar to, or lower than, the\npredicted 1:100 year extreme sea level. The typical recur-\nrence period for Lisbon style intraplate earthquakes is in the\nFigure 6. Maximum elevation (m) in the inner finite element model, (a) the region around Cornwall,\nSW England and (b) along the Cornish coast, with numbered points as shown in Figure 6a indicating\ndistance along coast (upper abscissa label) and model node number (lower abscissa label).\nC04007 HORSBURGH ET AL.: LISBON-TYPE TSUNAMI IMPACT ON THE UK\n10 of 15\nC04007\nrange 1,000\u201310,000 years [Gra`cia et al., 2003; Scholz et\nal., 1986]. The modeling supports the conclusion of\nKerridge et al. [2005] that there is very low risk to the\nUnited Kingdom and northern Europe. Tsunami impact\nupon the Bristol Channel (a region of extremely high tides)\nwas reduced since bathymetry-driven refraction directs any\ntsunami toward the north coast of Cornwall.\n[30] In an experiment that smoothed the topographic\nirregularities at the shelf edge (Figure 8a) the multiple\nbeams of high elevation disappeared, although a single\nbeam still emanated from the Goban Spur. It seems reason-\nable to conclude that the former arose as a result of\nconvergence and divergence over the many canyons known\nto exist in the shelf edge at this location. The amplification\nthat remains with the smoothed bathymetry is probably due\nto interaction of the primary wave and a refracted wave at\nthe sharp corner of the Goban Spur. In an independent\nexperiment (Figure 8b), the topography of the Galician Rise\nabove 4200 m was removed, allowing a more direct route\nfor wave energy toward the European continental shelf. This\ncaused an increase in the amplitude of the beams yet,\nparadoxically, reduced the energy flux over that part of\nthe shelf facing the primary wave (Figure 11d). A possible\nexplanation is that in the absence of the Galician Rise,\nwaves take a more direct route toward the Goban Spur\nwhere refraction redirects energy into the Celtic Sea. In any\ncase, through complex interactions, the Galician Rise\nappears to shield the U.K. coastline from any tsunami on\nthis trajectory. Gjevik et al. [1997] noted a similar effect due\nto the Gorringe Bank in their model of the 28 February 1969\ntsunami, with a source south of the Horseshoe Abyssal\nPlain.\n[31] For this particular event it appears that the wide\nEuropean continental shelf provides a degree of protection\nto the coastline by reflecting and dissipating tsunami energy.\nThe fact that frictional dissipation is an order of magnitude\nless than energy flux convergence at the shelf break\n(Figures 9\u201311c) implies that reflection and scattering are\nmore important than frictional dissipation here. In contrast,\non the Iberian peninsula (which has only a narrow shelf),\nenergy transformations do not occur until waves are very\nFigure 7. Modified bathymetry (m) for sensitivity experi-\nments.

The shallow water on broad shelves also\nreduces the tsunami phase speed, on the one hand giving\nmore lead time for tsunami warning, but also potentially\nallowing the wavelength to match critical topographic scales\nand give rise to amplifying interactions. Our results show\nsignificant local reamplification due to shoaling and reso-\nnance. There is still much energy in the Celtic Sea after 8 h,\nas seen in Figure 5b, and this slow decay of energy is\nconsistent with other studies: Fine et al. [2005] stated that\nlocal differences in Q-factor and wave period are topo-\ngraphically induced, and Titov et al. [2005] also noted\nprolonged ringing after multiple topographic interactions.\nOur results (Figure 6) illustrate a high degree of variability\nin maximumwave amplitude around that part of the coastline\nmost affected by the waves. Calculations of the Q-factor,\nbased on time series for locations 5 and 7 in Figure 6a,\nand using the methodology of Kulikov et al. [1996], gave\nvalues of 13. This is indicative of a strong resonant response\non the shelf, and although we see high variability in wave\namplitude, the decay characteristics are more spatially\nuniform, suggesting that the ringing is set up over the wider\nshelf rather than in specific localities. Our energy time series\nare consistent with this, showing the area-mean energy\ndensity in the selected nearshore region (the green line in\nFigures 9\u201311d) to decay fairly slowly. This pattern of decay\nwas insensitive to the bathymetric experiments we per-\nformed and instead reflects the resonant behavior of the\ndesignated area. Our results illustrate how, in subtle ways,\nbathymetric features have the potential to both increase and\ndecrease the hazard resulting from tsunamis.\n[32] NLSW models are generally considered to be a\nsuitable choice for propagating tsunamis of seismic origin,\nwhere the sea surface deformation responds almost instan-\ntaneously to seafloor movement and frequency dispersion\ncan be ignored in the generation region. They are not\nsuitable for shorter-wavelength tsunamis (e.g., those gener-\nated by submarine landslides), where dispersive effects are\nrequired and Boussinesq equation models are more accurate\n[Lynett and Liu, 2002]. Frequency dispersion can also be\nimportant when tsunamis propagate over long distances.\nThe 26 December 2004 Sumatra tsunami generated a wealth\nof observational evidence and prompted a reevaluation of\nmodeling techniques. Wavelet analysis on altimetry data\n[Kulikov, 2006] showed that the high-frequency compo-\nnents of the tsunami, with approximately 10 km wave-\nlength, were distinctly dispersive. This suggests that\nfrequency dispersion may be a necessary ingredient of\nnumerical models used for the transoceanic propagation of\ntsunamis [Grilli et al., 2006]. Highly nonlinear Boussinesq-\nFigure 9. Energy diagnostics for the B2 run.

With a suitable treatment of the moving shoreline\nboundary [e.g., Lynett et al., 2002] these models produce\naccurate wave runup when compared to analytical and\nexperimental solutions. Ioualalen et al. [2007] have recently\nused the FUNWAVE model [Chen et al., 2000] to simulate\nrunup in Thailand following the 26 December 2004 tsunami\nand achieved excellent agreement with 58 sets of observa-\ntions. The advantage of this approach is that a single model\nwith the most appropriate physics can be used to simulate\ntsunami behavior from source to beach.\n[33] This study reinforces the scale of the inherent uncer-\ntainties when attempting to model tsunami risk in regions\nwhere the consequences of tsunamigenic earthquakes are\nmore likely to be felt. Although the physics of these\nuncertainties are well known, they must be correctly\naccounted for in a sufficiently large ensemble if maximum\nbenefit is to be gained from tsunami modeling. Indeed, in\nour study, because of the subsequent interaction with\nbathymetry it may be that only very small changes in the\nsource model fault orientations could have yielded signifi-\ncantly different results. The choice of (time integrated)\nenergy flux divergence as a diagnostic variable is seen to\nbe useful when identifying regions of significant wave\ntransformation. The divergence of energy flux can reveal\nregions of transformation that are not apparent when look-\ning at energy flux itself. This could be useful, for instance,\nwhen comparing various model runs in risk assessment\nstudies.\n[34] Acknowledgments.
