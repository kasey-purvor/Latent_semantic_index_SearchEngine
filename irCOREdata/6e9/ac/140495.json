The local stress images were observed \nto be correlated with morphological features on the metal surface that were purposely \nintroduced during specimen preparation. Local stress relaxation and morphological evolution \nwith thermal cycling were studied using the stress maps combined by post-mortem SEM \nexamination.  It was found that the morphology in the specimen having an initial polished \nsurface was quite stable, while that in the specimen with a rough surface was unstable.  The \naverage residual stress in the specimen with the unstable morphology decreased with thermal \ncycling and it eventually failed along TGO\/YSZ interface.  The specimen with stable \nmorphology maintained a high TGO stress throughout the thermal cycling process and failed \nalong TGO\/bond coat interface.  The rough surface was also found to give rise to the \nformation of transition alumina (\u03b8-Al2O3) in the TGO which was correlated with a reduced \nTGO stress. \nKey words: TBCs; Stress Mapping; Luminescence Spectroscopy; Interface Morphology; \nFailure Mechanism \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1 Introduction \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n2 \n \n \nThermal barrier coatings (TBCs) are applied on turbine blades in both land-based power \ngeneration gas turbines and airplane engines to improve the performance and efficiency of \nthe engines. Subjected to high temperature oxidation and cyclic heating and cooling service \nconditions, TBCs degrade in both thermal protection capability and mechanical stability, as a \nresult of a combination of thickening of the alumina thermally grown oxide (TGO), sintering \nof the top layer (YSZ), and weakening of critical interfaces. Eventually TBC top coating falls \noff from the metallic substrate after a certain period of service. However, the actual failure \nmechanisms of TBCs often turn out to be much more complicated. Detailed mechanistic \ndescriptions of TBC failure mechanisms can be found in the literature [1-5] \nTBCs typically have two ceramic layers (YSZ and TGO) and two metallic components (bond \ncoat and substrate). It is believed that the driving force for the TBC spallation is the stored \nenergy in ceramic layers resulting from the thermal expansion mismatch between metallic \nmaterials and ceramic layers when the component is cooled [1, 6]. Therefore, the \nmeasurement of the residual stress in the TGO is important for achieving a better \nunderstanding of TBC failure. Photo-luminescence piezo-spectroscopy (PLPS) is an optical \ntechnique for stress determination in alumina and alumina-containing ceramics [7, 8]. Its high \nspatial resolution and fast acquisition make it a powerful non-destructive evaluation tool for \ncharacterisation of thermal barrier coatings. PLPS has been employed in several studies to \ncharacterise the stress in the TGO in TBC systems [9-12] and efforts have been made to \nrelate the residual stress in TGO to the remaining lifetime of the TBCs [13, 14]. However, the \nthermal mismatch stress in TGO can be relaxed by a variety of mechanisms. Therefore the \nrelationship between residual stress and remaining TBC lifetime cannot be established \nwithout gaining a better understanding of coating failure mechanisms and stress relaxation in \nTGO.  \nThe mechanics associated with the TBC coating failure are not fully understood. TBCs have \nbeen observed to fail in quite different ways; sometimes within the YSZ coating, sometimes \nalong the TGO\/bond coat interface, and sometimes at the TGO\/YSZ interface [2, 15]. Surface \nroughness has been found to have a large effect on TGO residual stress and TBC lifetime [16-\n18] and to influence the oxidation of the bond coat at high temperature [19]. The interface \nmorphology in some TBC systems has been observed to be unstable in that so-called \n\u201crumpling\u201d of the TGO occurs and its amplitude grows with the cyclic oxidation [20-22]. \nThese interface morphological instabilities can lead to the formation of cracks which are the \nnuclei for coating failure. The interface morphology instabilities have been suggested to be \ndue to thermal expansion mismatch, phase transformations, and bond coat swelling [5, 23], as \nwell as being influenced by the mechanical properties of the bond coat [24]. The main \npurpose of the current work was to investigate the interrelation between interface morphology \nand TGO residual stress and the effect of morphological changes on coating failure. In this \nwork, firstly specimens with known morphological features were studied by PLPS.  The \nstress variations obtained from luminescence mapping were found to match the major \nmorphological features introduced purposely during specimen preparation. Then two \nspecimens prepared with different surface roughness were subjected to thermal cycling and \ncharacterised by luminescence mapping. It was found that grit-blasting of substrate surface \nled to stress distributions with irregular patterns, while surface polishing led to regular stress \ndistributions. Changes in the stress distributions were related to the morphological changes as \nthermal cycling progressed.  Due to the high spatial resolution capability of PLPS, the spatial \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n3 \n \n \ndistribution of \u03b8-Al2O3 and stress relaxation by local \u03b8-Al2O3 presence was also examined in \ndetail by luminescence mapping. \n2 Experimental \nTwo different Thermal Barrier Coating (TBC) systems were prepared and studied in the \npresent work: \na TBC system with a Pt-diffused bond coat, and \na TBC system with a Pt-modified aluminide bond coat. \nThe Pt-modified aluminide bond coat has the \u03b2-(Pt,Ni)Al microstructure (i.e. NiAl with Pt in \nsolid solution), while the Pt-diffused bond coat retains the  \u03b3 - \u03b3\u2019 microstructure of the \nsuperalloy substrate. Hence the Pt-diffused bond coat has a much higher creep resistance than \nthe Pt-modified aluminide bond coat at high temperature. These two different bond coats \ncould therefore exhibit different stress build-up and relaxation characteristics during thermal \ncycling and consequently, different failure mechanisms of TBCs.  \nThe substrates adopted for both systems consisted of small disks of CMSX-4, 15mm in \ndiameter and 3mm in thickness.  \nThe TBC systems with a Pt-diffused bond coat were manufactured at the National High \nTemperature Surface Engineering Centre of Cranfield University. One dimensional \nroughness was introduced by mechanically grinding the substrate (CMSX-4) surface in one \ndirection, generating an array of grooves all parallel to each other. One of the specimens had \ncoarse and deep grooves on its surface, whereas the other one had relatively fine and shallow \ngrooves. The grinding procedure was carried out in an Edgetek 5 axis super abrasive machine \nby Holroyd.  The ground coupons were then coated with a 10\u00b5m thick layer of Platinum by \nDC magnetron sputtering at a pressure of 7*10-3 mbar using a Nordiko2500 unit. The \ncoupons were heat treated for 1 hour at 1190 \u02daC in vacuum, in order to produce a bond coat \nwith the \u03b3 - \u03b3\u2019 structure. At this stage, the grooves machined onto the substrate were still \nevident on the surface of the bond coat and the surface roughness was assessed using a \nTalysurf profilometer, measured along a direction perpendicular to the main irregularities. \nThe Ra parameter for the coarse ground specimen was 1.165\u00b5m while for the fine ground \nspecimen was 0.682\u00b5m. The specimens were finally coated with a 200\u00b5m thick layer of YSZ \nby Electron Beam Physical Vapour Deposition (EBPVD). \nThe TBC system with a Pt aluminide (\u03b2 structure) bond coats were provided by Chromalloy \nUK Ltd. The detailed manufacturing procedure for this set of specimens were given in [25]. \nHere only a brief summary is given. The superalloy substrate was first subjected to a grit-\nblast using alumina grit and then a layer of Pt was deposited by electroplating, followed by \nheat treatment at 1050-1100\u02daC and pack-aluminising process. The specimens had two \ndifferent bond coat surface finishes. For the specimen having \u2018normal\u2019 surface finish the YSZ \nceramic top was deposited directly onto the surface after producing the bond coat for which \nthe roughness was measured as Ra=5 \u00b5m. For the specimen with \u2018polished\u2019 surface, the bond \ncoat surface was polished with 1 \u00b5m diamond paste and had an Ra of 0.5 \u00b5m. The YSZ top \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n4 \n \n \ncoat was applied by EBPVD at 1000\u02daC in an argon\/oxygen background atmosphere. The \nYSZ top coat thickness for the specimens with normal surface was ~70 \u00b5m and for the \nspecimens with polished surface was ~100 \u00b5m. \nThermal cycling was conducted using a rig in which the specimen was moved in and out of a \nfurnace by a computer-controlled motion stage.  The temperature of the furnace was \nmaintained at either 1135\u02daC or 1150\u02daC.  Immediately after being removed from the furnace \nthe specimens were fan-cooled by laboratory air.  The specimens dwelt at high temperature \nfor 1 h and stayed out of the furnace for 30 minutes.  The specimens were removed at \nspecified intervals for the luminescence measurements. \nFor TGO residual stress measurement, luminescence spectra were acquired using a Renishaw \nRaman optical microprobe (model 2000) fitted with a motorised mapping stage.  The laser \nsource was a green Ar+ laser with a wavelength of 514.5 nm. An air conditioning unit was \nused to maintain a stable room temperature at 22\u00b10.3\u00b0C.  Before and after each experiment, \nthe spectrometer was calibrated by taking a spectrum from a strain-free single crystal \nsapphire sample. \nAn acquisition time of one second was used for each spectrum collection. For high spatial \nresolution mapping, an objective lens, 50X (075NA ) was used, which is capable of \ndelivering a spot size of 1-2 \u00b5m. The mapping area was 300 \u00d7 200 \u00b5m and the pitch size was \n5 \u00b5m.  For even higher resolution mapping, an objective lens, 100X (095NA ) was used, \nwhich is capable of delivering a spot size of < 1 \u00b5m. The mapping area was varied for \ndifferent purposes and the pitch size was 1 or 2 \u00b5m.  \n In order to track back to the same area on the specimen after different thermal treatments, \nreference points that not only survive high temperature treatments, but also have geometrical \nstability all the time are critical for mapping accurately the stress evolution. For this purpose \nthree micro-indentation marks aligned in a straight line were made on each specimen surface.  \nThe Vickers indents were about 70 microns in diagonal length.  The sharp corners of the \nindents were found to be quite stable during the heat treatment and be ideal reference points. \nPosition registering between successive maps with an error less than 5\u00b5m was achieved. \nIn addition, stress relaxation near a specimen edge has been observed in a separate study of \nTBC systems (unpublished). Such relaxation only occurred under the YSZ within a short \ndistance (~10 \u00b5m) of the edge. In this study, care was taken to choose a mapping area which \nwas well away from the edges (typically >0.2mm) to exclude the effect of edge creep \nrelaxation on stress evolution. \nSince the R2 luminescence line of \u03b1-alumina has a nearly linear dependence on stress [8, 10], \nall the peak shift data in this paper are of the R2 line. For the convenience of presentation, the \npeak shift in this paper is expressed as a positive number. In reality the peak shift is negative \ndue to a compressive residual stress in TGO. \n \n3 Results \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n5 \n \n \n3.1 Residual stress in TGO on Pt diffusion bond coats with known morphology \nThe specimens with Pt diffusion bond coats were examined using PLPS after 20 thermal \ncycles at 1150\u02daC.  Fig.1 shows peak shift (stress) maps for both specimens.  A peak shift of 5 \ncm-1 corresponds approximately to a biaxial stress of 1 GPa. In both cases the shift is large \nand corresponds to a residual stress of 5-6 GPa. The specimen which had the coarse ground \nsubstrate (Fig.1a) clearly exhibits one dimensional features in the TGO stress distribution, \nwhereas the fine ground specimen (Fig.1b) does not show any similar features. The stress \nvariations in Fig.1b are quite randomly-positioned. \nBoth specimens failed after about 37 thermal cycles and post-mortem SEM examination was \nconducted on spalled pieces of coating and exposed substrate surfaces. It was found that both \nspecimens failed along the TGO\/bond coat interface. The under side of the coating pieces \nspalled from the coarse ground specimen was covered predominantly by Al2O3 (Fig.2a) and \nlongitudinal features are clearly visible. The under side of the coating spalled from the fine \nground specimen was also covered in Al2O3.  However, the longitudinal features could not be \nseen until the electron beam was incident on the specimen surface at a shallow angle. As \nshown in Fig.2b, the one dimensional features were then visible, but they are much shallower \nthan for the coarse ground specimen. \n3.2 Residual stress in the TGO on Pt-Al bond coats with different surface conditions. \nThese specimens were subjected to thermal cycling at 1135\u00b0C and luminescence mapping \nwas carried out periodically. Sequential mapping was conducted on the same areas of each \nspecimen in order to follow how the local features develop.  \nFigs.3a-c show how the stress distribution in one particular area of the specimen with normal \nsurface finish evolved from 63rd cycle to 103rd cycle. The average stress in the TGO for this \nsample (approximately 1 GPa) was much lower than that for the ones with Pt diffusion bond \ncoats and decreased gradually with thermal cycling. However, some larger changes occurred \nlocally. For example the stress around the area \u2018A\u2019 in Fig. 3 decreased significantly with \nthermal cycling; the low stress region \u2018B\u2019 in Fig.3b disappeared after further cycling in Fig.3c; \nand a new low stress zone \u2018C\u2019 has appeared in Fig.3c.  \nIn contrast, no major changes in stress distribution were observed for the specimen with the \npolished surface (Figs. 4a-c) and the mean stress was much higher (approximately 3.5 GPa). \nThe maps show well-defined regions that have stresses higher and lower than the average and \nthese regions remain in the same place as thermal cycling proceeds. \nFig. 5 gives the TGO stress evolution as a function of thermal cycling for the two specimens \nwith Pt-Al bond coats. The TGO stress in the specimen with normal surface finish was \ninitially very low (~5 cm-1, or 1GPa), quickly increased to 2 GPa within a few cycles, and \nthen decreased gradually with further thermal cycling. In contrast, the TGO stress in the \nspecimen with the polished surface was much higher (~4 GPa) and remained at this high \nlevel (Fig.4b).  \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n6 \n \n \nThe approximate \u03b8- Al2O3 content in the TGO was estimated using the following equation \n[26]: \n \n21146261454614330\n146261454614330\nRR AAAAA\nAAAC\n++++\n++\n=\u03b8     Eq. 1 \nwhere A14330, A14546 and A14626 are the areas of luminescence peaks centred at 14330 cm-1, \n14546 cm-1 and 14626 cm-1 respectively and AR1 and AR2 are the peak areas of the \ncharacteristic R1 and R2 peaks. The evolution \u03b8- Al2O3 content with thermal cycling is also \ngiven in Figs.5a and b for the specimens with Pt-Al bond coats. The \u03b8- Al2O3 content in the \nspecimen with normal surface finish was much higher than that in the polished one. The \u03b8- \nAl2O3 content in both specimens decreased with thermal cycling, but the \u03b8- Al2O3 content in \nspecimen with normal surface finish experienced a dramatic decrease in the first 25 cycles \nand after that the \u03b8- Al2O3 content change was much slower. \nLuminescence mapping with a pitch size of 2 \u00b5m was conducted to reveal detailed local \nstress variation. Many very low stress region (as arrowed in Fig.6a) were seen in the normal \nsurface finish specimen, which were only a few microns in size. In contrast, the residual \nstress in the polished specimen was quite uniform even at high resolution, as shown in Fig.6b.  \nThermal cycling was terminated at the 105th cycle for the normal surface specimen and at \n75th cycle for the polished specimen and the coatings were intact at this stage. However, the \ncoatings on both specimens were found to have failed after leaving for two months at room \ntemperature and in ambient atmosphere. SEM was used to investigate the failure mode. It was \nfound the failure locus for the specimen with normal surface finish was along the TGO\/YSZ \ninterface while that for the polished specimen was along the TGO\/bond coat interface. \nFigs.7a and b give the SEM images of the exposed substrates. The TGO layer stayed on the \nnormal surface finish substrate with sporadic YSZ residual grains. Conversely the polished \nspecimen (Fig.7b) has only small amount of residual TGO left on bond coat.  \nX-ray diffraction was used to examine the phase composition of the failed TBC. No \nmonoclinic phase zirconia was seen in the ceramic, so the room temperature failure was not \ndue to tetragonal to monoclinic transformation. The failure was probably caused by moisture-\nassisted subcritical spall propagation [27]. However, further detailed investigation is needed \nto substantiate this speculation. \n4  Discussion \n4.1 Stress redistribution by interface roughness \nFigs.1a and 2a clearly shows that bond coat surface roughness influences TGO residual stress. \nThese two figures have a similar magnification and hence it is evident that the number of \nlinear features in the stress map (Fig.1a) is fewer than in the SEM image (Fig.2a). In earlier \nstudies [11] we showed that the luminescence mapping has a resolution of <5 \u00b5m and so \nluminescence mapping should have been able to pick up features corresponding to all the \nparallel grooves in Fig.2a if they were all capable of influencing TGO stress to a similar \nextent. Furthermore, the luminescence mapping of the specimen with the fine ground surface \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n7 \n \n \nshows no indication of linear features. These observations indicate that the amplitude of \nsurface roughness has to be larger than a critical value to have a significant influence on the \nTGO stress distribution.  Since the roughness for the coarse ground specimen was \nRa=1.165\u00b5m and that for the fine ground specimen was Ra=0.682\u00b5m, so the critical \nroughness should be between 0.682 and 1.165. \nThe effect of local curvature on the peak shift of the luminescence from TGO has been \nassessed using a composite cylinder model in a previous paper [26] and by Gong and Clarke \nfor a sinusoidal TGO (but without top coat)[28]. According to the models, the peak shift of a \nconcave curvature should be almost the same as that for a flat surface, while the peak shift at \na convex location is smaller by an amount depending on the curvature (as reflected in the \namplitude and wavelength of the TGO roughness compared with the TGO thickness). \nTherefore, in Fig.1a the strips with relatively large peak shift correspond to local concave \ncurvature (valleys), while the strips with relatively small peak shift correspond to local \nconvex curvature (peaks).   \n4.2 The effect of surface roughness on morphological evolution and failure \nSince stress mapping is sensitive to the morphological features, stress maps could be used to \ntrack morphological changes during thermal cycling. However, it must be borne in mind that \nother factors influence local TGO stress, such as damage, and therefore variations in stress do \nnot necessarily relate directly to surface morphology.  Nevertheless, one interpretation of the \nlow stress areas in Figs.3 and 4 is that they corresponding to local peaks in the bond coat \nsurface and the high stress areas correspond to local valleys. The irregular shapes of the high \nand low stress areas in Figs.3a-c are consistent with the irregular surface morphology \nresulting from the grit blasting during specimen preparation. Similarly, the more regular \nstress variation seen for the polished specimen in Figs. 4a-c is consistent with a gradual \nrumpling of the bond coat\/TGO interface resulting from thermal exposure.   \nThe rough interface introduced in the manufacturing of the specimen with normal surface \nfinish favours further short wavelength roughening of the interface which facilitates the \nformation of local cracks between top coat and TGO [24]. Eventually this leads to weakening \nof the YSZ\/TGO interface and finally delamination at this interface driven by the release of \nstored elastic energy within the YSZ. \nConversely the specimen with the polished surface maintained a relatively flat bond \ncoat\/TGO interface throughout the thermal cycling process with only relatively gentle, long \nwavelength morphology and hence no large local relaxation of the TGO stress. Thus the \nTGO\/YSZ interface was not degraded in this case and eventual failure was by delamination \nalong the bond coat\/TGO interface driven by the release of stored elastic energy within both \nthe TGO and the YSZ. \n4.3 The effect of the \u03b8- Al2O3 content on the TGO residual stress  \nFrom Figs.5a and b it is clear that the TGO in the specimen with normal surface finish Pt-Al \nbond coat had a much higher \u03b8-Al2O3 content than that with the polished bond coat, \nespecially in the early stage. This suggests that the polished surface favours the formation of \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n8 \n \n \nthe stable \u03b1- Al2O3, while the rough surface encourages the formation of the transition phase \n\u03b8- Al2O3. Also from Fig.5a, the TGO stress increases as the \u03b8- Al2O3 content decreases.  \nThe correlation between \u03b8- Al2O3 content and TGO residual stress was investigated further \nusing the data from the 2501 spectra acquired for the luminescence map of the specimen with \nnormal surface finish after 25 cycles. The transition phase content as a function of peak shift \nis plotted in Fig.8.  It can be seen that the peak shift tends to increase as the transition phase \ncontent decreases. The reduction in the stress in the \u03b1-Al2O3 could be due to the \u03b8-Al2O3 \nhaving a lower elastic modulus and\/or a higher CTE than \u03b1-Al2O3. High resolution \nluminescence mapping (area 30 x 20 \u00b5m and pitch size 1 \u00b5m) was conducted within a small \narea to reveal the distributions of the \u03b8-Al2O3 and TGO stress. As shown in Fig.9a the \u03b8-\nAl2O3 was not uniformly distributed, but was preferentially located in the lower region of the \nmapped area. Fig.9b is the corresponding peak shift map and shows that the higher stress \nregion matches the region with lower \u03b8-Al2O3 content quite well. The low stress areas \nassociated with the transition phase are only a few microns in extent (Fig.9b) and similar in \nsize to the small regions of low stress seen as \u201cspeckles\u201d in Figs. 3a-c. These can be \nattributed to the existence of the \u03b8- Al2O3. From Figs. 3a-c, it is clear the number of the \n\u201cspeckles\u201d decreases with thermal cycling, which is consistent with the \u03b8- Al2O3 content \ndecreasing with thermal cycling as shown in Fig.5a. \nWhen significant transition \u03b8-alumina was present in the TGO, the regions within the \u03b8-Al2O3 \nthat subsequently transformed to \u03b1- Al2O3  are placed under a tensile strain due to the volume \ndecrease associated with the phase transformation. Thus the presence of transition \u03b8 alumina \nis an extra contributor to the stress evolution apart from the morphology.  \nIt is far from being fully understood as to why and how transition \u03b8- alumina is formed. In a \nseparate study [26], we found that, despite two turbine blades having been subjected to \nidentical thermal treatments, and supposed to have the same chemical composition and \nmanufacturing procedure, they had significantly different \u03b8 content at convex parts of the \nblades. The result from the present study and that from [26] both seem to indicate that the \nkinetics of the formation of the \u03b8- Al2O3 and its transformation to \u03b1- Al2O3 could be changed \nsignificantly by subtle changes in chemical composition, interface morphology or defect \ncontent in the TBC system. Further investigation is needed. \n \n5 Summary and Conclusions  \nIn this paper, it was observed that TGO stress distributions obtained by luminescence \nmapping of specimens with different degrees of one dimensional surface roughness can \nreflect morphological features of the bond coat\/TGO interface because sharp curvature in the \nTGO can give rise to significant local stress relaxation.  The interface roughness is also \nreflected in the frequency distribution, which is narrower for the smoother interface. \nThus the TGO stress maps for a coating on a substrate with a normal grit-blasted surface and \nPt-Al bond coat showed irregular patterns and low average stress due, at least in part, to \nrelaxation by local TGO bending.  Conversely, a similar specimen with a polished surface \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n9 \n \n \nhad much higher mean TGO stress and the maps showed more regular longer wavelength \nvariations, possibly caused by slight interface rumpling.  \nThe luminescence maps show that the TGO stress distribution for the specimen with the \nnormal surface finish is not stable with thermal cycling (i.e. some low stress regions appear to \nmove) and there was a gradual lowering of TGO stress with thermal cycling. This is \ninterpreted as the result of changing interface morphology due to rumpling. It leads to local \nseparation of the TGO\/YSZ\/ interface, which is thereby weakened, and finally this interface \ndelaminates driven by the release of stored elastic energy within the YSZ. Conversely the \npolished specimen had a high TGO residual stress comparable with the theoretical thermal \nmismatch stress throughout thermal cycling and the interface morphology was stable.  This \nspecimen eventually delaminated along the bond coat\/TGO interface driven by the release of \nstored elastic energy within both the TGO and the YSZ. \nThe TGO stress is also influenced by the presence of transition alumina (\u03b8-Al2O3) in the TGO, \nin addition to TGO morphology, and high transition alumina content was correlated with low \nTGO stress. \n \n \n \nAcknowledgement: \nThe authors thank EPSRC for financial support (grant GR\/T07329\/01), Prof. L.
