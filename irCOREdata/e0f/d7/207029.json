This paper contributes to a growing body of work concerned with \nexplaining the uneven diffusion of ISO 14001 at the global level. Drawing from the \nexisting theoretical and empirical literature we develop a series of hypotheses about \nhow various economic, market and regulatory factors influence the national count of \nISO 14001 certifications. These hypotheses are then tested using econometric \nestimation techniques using data for a panel of 142 developed and developing \ncountries. We find that per capita ISO 14001 counts are positively correlated with \nincome per capita, stock of foreign direct investment, exports of goods and services to \nEurope and Japan, and pressure from civil society. Conversely, productivity and \nlevels of state intervention are negatively correlated. The paper finishes by offering a \nnumber of recommendations to policy-makers concerned with accelerating the \ndiffusion of voluntary environmental standards. \n \n  2 \nIntroduction \nOne of the most significant trends in corporate environmental governance since the \nearly-1980s has been the rapid growth of self-regulatory initiatives (Rondinelli & \nBerry, 2000; Gunningham & Sinclair, 2002; Paton, 2002). These comprise a variety \nof approaches and instruments whereby firms set and enforce rules and standards of \npermissible behaviour on a voluntary basis, rather than in response to formal \nregulatory requirements (Segerson & Li, 1999; Haufler, 2001). Yet, arguably the \nmost visible example of self-regulation has been ISO 14001, an international, \nvoluntary standard for environmental management promoted by the Geneva-based \nInternational Organization for Standardization (ISO). \nIn common with many other self-regulatory codes adopted by corporations over \nthe past two decades the origins of ISO 14001 are deeply rooted in the process of \nglobalisation. It was primarily conceived to facilitate trade and investment by \nreplacing numerous and often conflicting national standards for environmental \nmanagement with a single international one (Davy, 1997; Quazi et al, 2001; Melnyk \net al, 2003). Moreover, in defining a framework for environmental improvement \nflexible enough to be adapted to very different national and corporate conditions, the \narchitects of ISO 14001 hoped that the standard would appeal to firms in both \ndeveloped and developing countries (Rondinelli & Vastag, 2000; Wilson, 2002).1 \nYet, despite its alleged global credentials, it is clear that implementation of ISO \n14001 has been highly geographically uneven. In absolute numbers, uptake has been \n                                                 \n1\n The term \u201cfirm\u201d is used broadly here to denote all private- and public-sector entities, ranging from \nmanufacturing units to administrative buildings, capable of acquiring ISO 14001 certification. \n  3 \ngreatest in Japan, followed by a number of leading European countries, the US and \nAustralia. A number of late industrialising economies in East and Southeast Asia \nhave also been rapidly implementing the standard in recent years. Elsewhere, \nhowever, uptake has been comparatively low (Matouq, 2000; Steger, 2000). In per \ncapita terms, the Scandinavian countries, Switzerland, Singapore, Australia, Japan \nand some other European countries top the list. \nWhat explains the wide variation in the take-up of ISO 14001? Previous insights \ninto this question have mostly come from comparative analyses of certification \ncounts in Europe and the US (Prakash, 1999; Delmas, 2002; Kollman & Prakash, \n2002). These studies have been instrumental in highlighting the role played by \ndifferent features of the national institutional environment in promoting and\/or \ninhibiting the take-up of ISO 14001. Based on qualitative evidence from a handful of \ndeveloped economies, however, question marks remain over the generalisability of \ntheir findings. This points to the need for multiple country, quantitative research. Yet, \nthe only study of this kind is itself problematic (Corbett & Kirsch, 2001), relying on a \nhandful of dubious proxy variables and omitting a large number of developing \ncountries from the sample. \nThis paper responds to the gap in the existing literature by undertaking a more \nsystematic and broad-based analysis of international variations in the uptake of ISO \n14001. Drawing from recent theoretical and empirical literature on industry self-\nregulation and environmental management systems (EMS) we develop a series of \nhypotheses about the relationship between ISO 14001 certification counts and various \ncharacteristics of the national institutional environment. These hypotheses are then \ntested quantitatively for a panel of 142 countries using a set of measurable proxies. \n  4 \nBriefly, our results suggest that take-up of ISO 14001 has been influenced by both \nsupply-side and demand-side factors. The per capita certification count is positively \ncorrelated with income per capita, the export of goods and services to Europe and \nJapan, the presence of foreign direct investment and pressure from civil society. \nConversely, productivity and state intervention are negatively correlated with per \ncapita certification counts.  \nThe rest of the paper is organised as follows. First, we provide a brief \nintroduction to ISO 14001 and review previous studies that have sought to explain \ncross-country variations in take-up of the standard. Hypotheses are developed in the \nnext section. We then describe the data and methods used in the study, followed by \nresults and a broader discussion of the implications of our research. \n \nThe nature and origins of ISO 14001 \nAccording to Steger (2000, p.24), an environmental management system (EMS) can \nbe defined as, \u2018\u2026a transparent, systematic process known corporate-wide, with the \npurpose of prescribing and implementing environmental goals, policies, and \nresponsibilities, as well as regular auditing of its elements.\u2019 The origins of systems \nfor managing firms\u2019 environmental impacts can be traced back to the 1970s (Krut & \nGleckman, 1998). Yet it was not until the following decade that widespread interest \nin EMS emerged. This was closely bound-up with a broader shift towards self-\nregulation whereby firms, subject to ever greater levels of public scrutiny, began to \nadopt voluntary codes of conduct in order to demonstrate their environmental \ncommitment (Clapp, 2001; Hoffman, 2001; Stewart, 2001; King et al., 2002). The \nfirst EMS were unilateral, firm-level initiatives. Since the early-1990s, however, a \n  5 \nnumber of \u201cstandardised\u201d environmental management systems have been developed \nby various national (e.g., the British Standards Institute\u2019s 7750) and regional bodies \n(e.g., the European Union\u2019s Eco-Management and Audit Scheme) (Starkey, 1996). \nISO 14001 continues this trend toward standardisation at the international \nlevel. It was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), a \nSwiss-based non-governmental organisation set-up in 1946. Traditionally, the ISO \nrestricted its activities to writing technical standards for products in order to expedite \ntrade and technology transfer (Clapp, 2001). However, beginning in the late-1980s, it \nbegan writing standards for management processes and procedures. Following the \nsuccess of its first procedural standard, the ISO 9000 series for quality management, \nthe ISO initiated steps to introduce a parallel set of standards for environmental \nmanagement. The result was the ISO 14000 series which aims to provide a \ncomprehensive framework for systematically improving environmental performance \nthat can be accepted and implemented by organisations worldwide (Quazi et al, \n2001). \n ISO 14000 consists of two types of standard. The first, and the centrepiece of \nthe series, is the ISO 14001 procedural standard. A number of facilities certified \nthemselves to draft versions of ISO 14001 prior to its official release in September \n1996 (ISO, 2002). ISO 14001 sets out the minimum requirements of an effective \nenvironmental management system. These comprise main five elements: (1) an \nenvironmental policy; (2) an assessment of the organisation\u2019s environmental effects \nand compliance with legal and other requirements; (3) a management system defining \nthe responsibilities, procedures and controls required to achieve the organisation\u2019s \nenvironmental policy; (4) periodic audits and reviews of the environmental \n  6 \nmanagement system to ensure continuous improvement; and (5) a public statement \ndeclaring that ISO 14001 is being implemented (Krut & Gleckman, 1998, pp.10-12). \n Accompanying ISO 14001 is a set of guidance standards intended to provide \nassistance to managers in various aspects of environmental management. Several of \nthese provide guidelines for evaluating an organisation\u2019s environmental performance \nand management system, e.g.,  ISO 14010\/11\/12 (Environmental Auditing). Others, \nmeanwhile, are process and product evaluation standards which, as their name \nsuggests, focus on the analysis and evaluation of product and process characteristics, \ne.g., ISO 14020 (Environmental Labelling) (Melnyk et al, 2003). \n ISO 14001 is the only certifiable standard in the 14000 series. Firms that \ncomply with its requirements have two choices: declare themselves in compliance; or \nuse a registered auditor to verify that the organisation\u2019s operations conform to the \ndocumented environmental management system (Rondinelli & Vastag, 2000; \nMendel, 2002). In practice, self-certification carries only limited credibility, with the \nresult that many firms prefer third party accreditation. \nISO 14001 has come in for considerable criticism since its release in 1996. Much \nof this has centred on the fact that the standard does not require certified facilities to \nreduce their environmental impacts or set specific performance targets. Instead, it \nmerely calls on firms to commit themselves to legal compliance, a condition that \ncritics believe is unlikely to evoke significant investments in environmental \nimprovement (Roht-Arriaza, 1997; Krut & Gleckman, 1998; Clapp, 2001; Bansal & \nBogner, 2002). Supporters, however, claim that such criticism is misplaced. They \nargue that it is precisely the standard\u2019s flexibility that makes it a useful tool to address \nenvironmental issues in very different corporate and geographic settings.  \n  7 \nWhat is clear is that, much like ISO 9000 before it, ISO 14001 has proved \npopular with firms. In the six-year period 1995-2001 the number of certified facilities \ngrew from 257 to 36,765. Yet, as shown in Tables 1 and 2, uptake of the standard has \nbeen geographically uneven. So far, certification activity has been greatest in Europe \nand, to a lesser extent, the Far East. Elsewhere, however, enthusiasm for ISO 14001 \nhas been comparatively low. In fact, only ten countries account for nearly 70 per cent \nof world certifications, seven of which are member states of the European Union. \n \n< Insert tables 1 and 2 about here > \n \nReview and critique of the existing literature \nWhat accounts for the uneven diffusion of ISO 14001 worldwide? This question has \nrecently been addressed by two bodies of literature. Drawing heavily from \ninstitutional theory the first group of studies have taken a largely qualitative approach \n(Prakash, 1999; Delmas, 2002; Kollman & Prakash, 2002; Milstein et al, 2002). Their \nstarting point is the belief that firms will only implement ISO 14001 where the \napparent benefits more than offset the costs and, moreover, that these costs and \nrevenues are in turn shaped by the broader institutional environment in which firms \noperate. \nFollowing this approach, the very different certification counts in Europe and the \nUS are explained in terms of distinctive demand and supply-side characteristics of \ntheir national institutional environments. Thus, Kollman & Prakash (2002) and \nDelmas (2002) point to the pivotal role played by the British Standards Institute (BSI) \nin promoting ISO 14001 in the UK, and how the absence of an equivalent body has \n  8 \nhindered similar take-up of the standard in the US. They also draw a contrast between \nGermany, where certified firms have often received \u201crelief\u201d from regulatory agencies, \nand the US, whose more adversarial and legalistic tradition has prohibited similar \nconcessions from being granted to ISO 14001 compliant facilities. The result, these \nscholars argue, is that the economic incentives for implementing the standard have \nbeen far lower. Going further, Delmas describes how, unlike the US, many European \ncountries had prior experience of formal EMS (e.g., EMAS). This lowered the \nsubsequent costs of implementing and certifying ISO 14001 and contributed to its \ngreater popularity.  \nThe second approach taken in the literature is quantitative and has sought to \nidentify the determinants of ISO 14001 adoption using data from a far larger sample \nof countries. It is represented by a single study, Corbett & Kirsch (2001), who use a \nregression model to estimate the influence of four variables for a sample of 63 \ndeveloped and developing countries in 1998. The authors find statistically significant \nand positive relationships between ISO 14001 counts and export propensity, \n\u201cenvironmentality\u201d and, most strongly of all, ISO 9000 counts. Curiously, however, \ntheir estimations suggest that the level of development, proxied by income per capita, \ndoes not have a statistically significant effect. \nThe above works have done much to increase our understanding of various \ndemand- and supply-side variables implicated in the uneven diffusion of the ISO \n14001 environmental management standard across the globe. Neither, however, is \nwithout substantial drawbacks. Based exclusively on qualitative analysis and \nevidence from a handful of developed economies recent institutionalist accounts can \nbe criticised for their lack of generalisability.  \n  9 \nCorbett & Kirsch\u2019s (2001) study overcomes some of these shortcomings in that it \nuses quantitative techniques in a larger sample of developed and developing \ncountries. Yet, it too, is not without its weaknesses. Partly as a result of data \nlimitations the study only investigates a few variables. Moreover, several of these rely \non proxies which, at best, are weakly rooted in the actual concepts the authors purport \nto measure. For example, Corbett & Kirsch (2001) use a count of international \nenvironmental treaties ratified by each country as a proxy for \u201cenvironmental \nattitude\u201d or \u201cenvironmentality\u201d. It is far from clear, however, that ratification of \ninternational environmental treaties (\u201cenvironmentality\u201d) is a satisfactory measure of \n\u201c\u2026the extent to which firms in a given country are predisposed to care about \nenvironmental issues, whether due to government regulations or incentives, pressure \nfrom consumers, employees, NGOs\u2026or for other reasons\u201d (p. 334). Recent \nconceptual approaches argue that it is precisely the failure of public law and \nregulation to reflect wider societal demands for environmental protection that \nunderpin the emergence and diffusion of self-regulatory codes. Similarly, relying on a \nmeasure of aggregate exports to GDP ratio to capture supply chain pressures for \ncertification in foreign markets has only limited appeal, since reports strongly \nindicate that these requirements are only currently important in Europe and Japan \n(Roht-Arriaza, 1997; Tanner, 1998).  \nMore generally, although Corbett & Kirsch include the majority of countries \nwith ISO 14001 certifications in their sample (N=63), they omit all the ones that do \nnot. Selecting a sample on such a criterion leads to well-known selection bias in the \nestimations. Indeed, given that many of the excluded countries are developing ones, \n  10 \nwe suspect that it could go some way in explaining the surprising result that per \ncapita income has no statistically significant effect on certification counts.  \nThis paper seeks to overcome several of the weaknesses inherent in previous \nwork. With a view to generating more generalisable findings than existing qualitative \ncontributions we use econometric estimation techniques. Yet, going beyond Corbett \n& Kirsch, our study features a much larger sample (N=142) that is only constrained \nby the availability of data for our explanatory variables. Additionally, we test for the \ninfluence of a larger number of demand- and supply-side variables, using measures \nmore firmly rooted in the actual decision of firms to implement and certify ISO \n14001. Finally, in contrast to Corbett & Kirsch, our econometric model uses a lagged \ndependent variable. This allows us to control for the dynamics of ISO 14001 uptake \nand, with it, the well-documented propensity of firms in countries with previous \nexperience of ISO 14001 to adopt the standard2 (Delmas, 2002; Kollman & Prakash, \n2002). Without a panel data set, Corbett & Kirsch see no alternative to using ISO \n9000 take-up as a proxy for modelling this diffusion process, a shortcoming we \ncorrect with our research design.3 As such, we are better able to investigate other \nvariables thought to influence the take-up of ISO 14001. Inclusion of the lagged \ndependent variable also mitigates potential omitted variable bias since it is correlated \n                                                 \n2\n These so-called  \u201cpath dependencies\u201d in certification are commonly explained by the accumulation of \ninternal (e.g., know-how in documentation, procedural standardisation, etc.) and external (e.g., \nconsultancy services, registered auditors, etc.) capabilities which lower the subsequent costs, as well as \nthe perceived risks, of adopting ISO 14001 (Corbett & Kirsch, 2000; Kollman & Prakash, 2002). \n3\n It is telling that if we include the count of ISO 9000 certified companies as a further explanatory \nvariable in our estimation, its coefficient is clearly statistically insignificant. \n  11 \nwith any such variable (Finkel 1995). Because no model is ever complete, omitted \nvariables always represent a problem, potentially biasing the estimations. The \ninclusion of a lagged dependent variable mitigates this problem as the omitted \nvariables are indirectly controlled for. \nIn the next section we develop a series of hypotheses about how various \neconomic, market and regulatory factors influence the national count of ISO 14001 \ncertifications. For guidance, we draw not only from the findings of studies reviewed \nabove, but also a growing body of literature examining the take-up of environmental \nmanagement systems at the firm-level. This work has identified several reasons for \nimplementing an EMS and suggests that adoption decisions are often based on a \nnumber of different motives (e.g., Matouq, 2000; Khanna & Anton, 2002; Morrow & \nRondinelli, 2002). At the outset, it is worth pointing out that our choice of variables is \nnecessarily limited by the availability of data. Supply-side factors, such as the \navailability of assistance from non-governmental bodies, are especially problematic \nin this respect. Still, we believe that our study offers an innovative test of several of \nthe most important variables implicated in the variable take-up of ISO 14001. \n \nDevelopment of hypotheses \nNo doubt, one of the most important predications supplied by the existing literature is \nthat firms will only implement and certify themselves to ISO 14001 where they face \nstrong demand-side incentives to do so. These are said to be provided by two \nprincipal actors, markets and civil society. Beginning with the former, a great deal \nhas been written about pressure from business customers in export markets, and \nparticularly developed economy ones. If anecdotal reports are believed, a growing \n  12 \nnumber of firms in these countries are requiring their local and overseas suppliers to \nbe certified to ISO 14001. Moreover, expecting ISO 14001 to become a de facto \nstandard in the coming decade, many suppliers are obtaining certification in order to \n\u201cfuture-proof\u201d themselves (Chin & Pun, 1999; Steger, 2000; Cosbey, 2002; Rock, \n2002). According to more sophisticated accounts, however, supply chain \nrequirements for ISO 14001 are only a significant factor for exporters of goods and \nservices to Europe and Japan4 (Roht-Arriaza, 1997; Tanner, 1998; Kollman & \nPrakash, 2002). Only a handful of larger firms in the US, by contrast, are mandating \ncertification meaning that the incentive to adopt ISO 14001 is likely to be \ncomparatively low (Delmas, 2002). Indeed, as Table 2 above has shown, in relative \nterms there are very few ISO 14001 certifications in the US. Hence:  \n \nHypothesis 1. Countries that export a higher share of goods and services relative to \ntheir output to European Union states or Japan will have a higher number of ISO \n14001 certifications, whereas exports to the US do not matter. \n \nAnother source of market demand discussed in the literature comes from \ntransnational corporations (TNCs). Many of these firms, and particularly the larger, \nmore visible ones, are vulnerable to negative publicity regarding their environmental \nperformance (Willetts, 1998; Hastings, 1999). Consequently, a growing number of \n                                                 \n4\n Tanner (1998) describes how many firms in developing Asia found themselves unprepared to meet \ncustomer requirements for ISO 9000 in Europe. Consequently, they are rapidly certifying themselves \nto ISO 14001, anticipating that the standard will similarly become a condition for doing business in the \nnear future. \n  13 \nthem are requiring their local affiliates and subsidiaries to adopt voluntary \nenvironmental codes (UNCTAD, 1999; Steger, 2000; Haufler, 2001). In practice, this \noften means ISO 14001 which provides a single, flexible standard that can be applied \nand adapted across business units in different countries (Epstein & Roy, 1998; \nRondinelli & Vastag, 2000; Perry & Singh, 2002). Going further, in order to guard \nagainst environmental and reputational liabilities in supply chains, many leading \nTNCs are requesting their suppliers to implement and certify ISO 14001 compliant \nenvironmental management systems (Chang-Xing, 1999). This probably explains \nKhanna & Anton\u2019s (2002) finding that US firms with a stronger multinational \npresence are more likely to adopt an EMS. Taken together, then, these accounts \nsuggest that the local presence of transnationals is likely to be supportive of ISO \n14001 certification. Thus: \n \nHypothesis 2. Countries with higher levels of TNC involvement will have a higher \nnumber of ISO 14001 certifications. \n \nA third market-based motive for implementing an EMS that has received widespread \ncoverage in the recent literature is to secure competitive advantage through \nimprovements in operating performance. Of these, productivity gains appear to be the \nmost important, with proponents claiming that firms which implement ISO 14001 can \nsave significant costs by way of enhanced operational efficiency (Rondinelli & Berry, \n2000). Systematic evidence for these gains has yet to be established. However, \naccording to several commentators, they are likely to be greatest amongst firms with \nlow levels of productivity. Such firms, it is argued, have still to exploit many low \n  14 \ncost, high return investments in operational efficiency (so-called \u201clow hanging fruit\u201d) \nand are therefore well placed to gain substantially from implementing systems that \nassist in the identification and realisation of these opportunities (Davy, 1997; Tanner, \n1998). Companies with already high levels of efficiency, by contrast, stand relatively \nlittle to gain from implementing an ISO 14001 compliant management system, \nreducing their incentive to adopt the standard. Indeed, these claims are supported by \nrecent survey evidence, revealing that ISO 14001 has brought greater gains to \ncertified firms in developing countries (where one might assume productivity levels \nare relatively low) than their counterparts in developed ones (where productivity are \nlikely to be higher) (Raines, 2002): \n \nHypothesis 3. Countries with lower levels of productivity will have a higher number \nof ISO 14001 certifications. \n \nNon-governmental organisations (NGOs) and other civil society groups are another \nset of stakeholders widely implicated in generating demand for ISO 14001. \nAccording to an influential body of work such groups are assuming growing \nimportance in \u201cregulating\u201d the activities of corporations. Not only are they acting as \nsurrogate enforcement officials, putting pressure on corporations to adhere to \nregulatory norms, but NGOs are also taking a lead role in defining norms of \nappropriate and legitimate environmental behaviour. This, the literature suggests, \nowes much to the regulatory vacuum created by the failure of public law and \nenforcement to keep pace with rising environmental demand which has meant that \nfirms must increasingly secure a \u201clicence to operate\u201d directly from civil society by \n  15 \ndemonstrating their commitment to sound levels of environmental performance \n(Neale, 1997; Rodgers, 2000; Perry & Singh, 2002). \nOne way of accomplishing this is through the adoption of self-regulatory codes \nsuch as ISO 14001. These signal conformity with a recognisable standard and can \nhelp firms to communicate their environmental achievements to external stakeholders \n(Davy, 1997; Prakash, 1999; Bansal & Bogner, 2002). As such, they can help ward-\noff criticism from NGOs, delay calls from these groups for the introduction of more \nstringent government regulation, and even provide firms with rewards from \ncustomers and financial institutions (Gunningham & Sinclair, 2002). No doubt this \nexplains why firms, both in developing and especially developed economies, \nrecurrently cite \u201cpublic image\u201d and \u201csocial responsibility\u201d as one of the primary \nmotives for implementing and certifying ISO 14001 (Matouq, 2000; Delmas, 2002; \nMbohwa & Fukada, 2002; Morrow & Rondinelli, 2002; Perry & Singh, 2002; Raines, \n2002).  \nClearly, however, the incentive to adopt ISO 14001 will depend on the degree of \npressure from civil society groups (Gunningham & Sinclair, 2002; Hanks, 2002). \nWhere there are few NGOs to monitor and enforce standards of corporate behaviour, \nthe benefits of adopting the standard on public relations grounds alone are likely to be \nrelatively low. By contrast, where environmental demand is high, manifest in a dense \nnetwork of NGOs, the incentive will be far greater. Thus:  \n \nHypothesis 4. The higher the number of environmental NGOs relative to population \nsize present in a country the higher the number of ISO 14001 certifications. \n \n  16 \nGiven the suggestion that firms must also secure legitimacy for their activities from \nsociety at large certification pressures are also likely to depend on the general level of \npublic demand for environmental quality. Assuming, as many analysts do, that the \nenvironment is a normal good (McConnell, 1997), this implies that ISO certification \ncounts will be greatest in rich countries and least in poor ones.    \nYet, as well as influencing demand, income is also portrayed in the literature as \ndetermining the ability of firms to supply environmental self-regulation. According to \nanalysts, this stems from the relatively high start-up and subsequent maintenance \ncosts of ISO 14001 (Chin & Pun, 1999), particularly where firms: (a) have little or no \nprevious experience of environmental or quality management systems; (b) lack the \nnecessary financial, technological and managerial resources and capabilities to \nimplement and certify to ISO 14001; and (c) do not have the support of a network of \ngovernmental and\/or non-governmental organisations committed to promoting the \nstandard (Steger, 2000; Bansal & Bogner, 2002). In practice, experience suggests that \nboth of these conditions are most likely to be found in developing countries, \nespecially in the small-and-medium-scale sector (Chang-Xing, 1999; Raines, 2002). \nIndeed, the high costs of implementation and certification are recurrently cited as one \nof the key reasons for low levels of ISO 14001 certification in low-income countries \n(Davy, 1997; Mbohwa & Fukada, 2002). Taken together, therefore, these demand- \nand supply-side considerations suggest: \n \nHypothesis 5. The higher the per capita income the higher the number of ISO 14001 \ncertifications. \n \n  17 \nMore conceptually, it has been argued that the recent growth of industry self-\nregulation has gone hand-in-hand with the shift towards a smaller, more market-\ndriven state (Haufler, 2001). Thus, according to critics, globalisation has heightened \nconcern over the impact of environmental regulations on industrial competitiveness \n(Stewart, 2001; Evans et al., 2002; Welford, 2002). As a result, a growing number of \ngovernments in both developed and developing countries are turning towards \nvoluntary initiatives, promoted as a more flexible and cost-effective alternative to \nconventional directive- or market-based forms of regulation (Hillary & Thorsen, \n1999; Haufler, 2001; Newell, 2001; Gunningham & Sinclair, 2002; Wilson, 2002). \nWhat this suggests is that, far from being a complement to tougher public law \nand enforcement, self-regulatory codes such as ISO 14001 are more likely to be \nacting as a substitute. Moreover, given the implication that the shift towards corporate \nvoluntarism is part of a broader neo-liberal project to transfer the political and \nadministrative costs of regulation from the public to the private domain (Finger & \nTamiotti, 1999), one might expect the uptake of ISO 14001 to be most advanced in \ngovernmental regimes with limited state intervention. Thus: \n \nHypothesis 6. Countries with lower levels of state intervention are likely to have a \nhigher number ISO 14001 certifications.  \n \nResearch design \nISO (2002) publishes the number of facilities certified to ISO 14001 at the country \nlevel. To make this variable comparable, we normalise by population size so that our \ndependent variable is the number of ISO 14001 certifications per one million \n  18 \ninhabitants (ISO14001 p.c.). The data cover the period from 1996, the official release \ndate of ISO 14001, to 2001. Our ten explanatory variables are as follows. The value \nof exports relative to gross domestic product (GDP) is measured by three separate \nvariables, referring to goods and services exported to the 15 countries of the \nEuropean Union (EU15), the US, and Japan (EXPEU15GDP, EXPUSGDP, \nEXPJAPANGDP). Data are taken from OECD (2003). For the EU countries the \nEXPEU15GDP variable refers to exports to the other 14 EU members, for the US and \nJapan the EXPUSGDP and the EXPJAPANGDP variables are coded zero, \nrespectively. We measure the level of transnational involvement by the stock of FDI \nrelative to GDP since this better captures the overall impact of foreign TNCs in the \nhost economy than volatile short-term inflows (FDISTOCKGDP). These data are \nsourced from UNCTAD (2003). For productivity we have divided GDP in purchasing \npower parity (PPP) by the size of the labour force, yielding a measure of product per \nworker (GDPPERWORKER). Data are taken from World Bank (2003). As our \nmeasure of demand from civil society we use the per capita number of environmental \nnon-governmental organisations (ENVIROGROUPS p.c.) per country as reported by \nEuropa Publications (2001). This variable refers to the late-1990s and is time-\ninvariant due to lack of data. This is not problematic as the level of demand from civil \nsociety is unlikely to have changed much over such a short period as 1996 to 2001. \nPer capita income (GDP p.c.) is measured by per capita GDP in PPP, taken from \nWorld Bank (2003). It is important to use income data in PPP, and not the \nconventional income data at foreign exchange rates, since the latter are known to \nsubstantially underestimate effective purchasing power in poor countries. As stated \nabove, per capita income potentially captures both demand- and supply-side factors \n  19 \nimplicated in the take-up of ISO 14001.  However, since we control for \nenvironmental demand through the inclusion of environmental NGOs, our income \nvariable might be expected to predominantly measure supply-side aspects. \nWith respect to government intervention, we would ideally have liked to use a \nvariable which specifically measures the stringency of public environmental law and \nenforcement. Yet no such variable is available for our full sample of countries. In its \nabsence, we take a variable published by the conservative Heritage Foundation \n(2003), which forms part of their Index of Economic Freedom, as a proxy for the \nextent of general government intervention in the economy (GOVINTERVENTION). \nThe Foundation grades countries on a one to five scale according to: (a) the level of \ngovernment consumption as a percentage of the economy; (b) the extent of \ngovernment ownership of businesses and industries; (c) the share of government \nrevenues from state-owned enterprises; (d) government ownership of property; and \n(e) economic output produced by the government. \nAs a further control variable we use total GDP in PPP as a proxy for economic \nsize (GDP), taken from World Bank (2003). Without recourse to data representing \nthe total number of firms in a country, we realistically assume that bigger economies \nare likely to have more firms. A higher number of firms makes it more likely that \nsome of them are front-runners that experiment with ISO 14001 certification and \nstimulate a self-reinforcing process of take-up through the domestic economy via \ncoercive and demonstrative influences. We therefore expect a positive effect of \neconomic size on the per capita ISO 14001 count. A final control variable is the \nmanufacturing share of GDP (%MANUFACT), taken from World Bank (2003) and \nsupplemented by CIA (2002). All nominal variables have been converted to real 1996 \n  20 \nprices using the United States GDP deflator, taken from World Bank (2003). Table 3 \nprovides summary descriptive variable information. Note that the panel is not fully \nbalanced since, in the case of a small number of countries, one or more observations \nare missing due to insufficient data on one of the explanatory variables. Table 4 lists \nthe countries included in the sample. \n \n< Insert Tables 3 and 4 about here > \n \nWe estimate the following model: \n \nyit = \u03b1 + \u03b21yit-1 + \u03b22xit + \u03b3tTt + vit. \n \nThe subscript i represents each country in year t, y is the number of ISO 14001 \ncertifications and x is the vector of explanatory variables. The year-specific dummy \nvariables T capture general developments such as the worldwide spread of awareness \nabout the standard and correct for unobserved time effects. The vit is a stochastic error \nterm. We estimate equation (1) with Beck & Katz\u2019s (1995) popular and commonly \napplied time-series cross-sectional estimator with panel-corrected standard errors. \nThe error term is presumed to be heteroskedastic and contemporaneously correlated \nacross panels. Beck & Katz provide evidence from Monte Carlo analysis showing \nthat their estimator is more conservative and less likely to underestimate standard \nerrors than feasible generalized least squares (FGLS), the alternative estimator. Their \nestimator is thus less likely to wrongly attribute statistical significance to a \n  21 \ncoefficient, which is in fact insignificant. Such conservatism suits our research \npurpose well. \nAs argued above, the inclusion of a lagged dependent variable mitigates any \nomitted variable bias. It does so more comprehensively than estimation with country \nfixed-effects because the lagged dependent variable even mitigates the bias of time-\nvarying omitted variables. This is why we use Beck & Katz\u2019s (1995) time-series \ncross-sectional estimator with panel-corrected standard errors and a lagged dependent \nvariable rather than a fixed effects model. Another reason for this choice is that one \nof our variables is time-invariant and some others do not change much over time. A \nfixed-effects estimator cannot estimate the former and would estimate the latter only \nvery inefficiently. \nWe take the natural log of the dependent variable after adding one to the absolute \nnumber of ISO 14001 counts to make such logging possible for values of zero in \norder to mitigate the heteroscedasticity of the data. As concerns the explanatory \nvariables, we log all variables, which are strictly positive. In other words, our model \nis a log-linear one for most explanatory variables, which allows an easy to understand \nelasticity interpretation of the estimated coefficients. For a logged independent \nvariable, an estimated coefficient of, say, 0.9 means that a one per cent increase in \nthis variable is associated with a 0.9 per cent increase in ISO14001 certification. This \nmodel also exhibited a much better fit to the data.  \n \nResults \nColumn I of Table 5 reports estimation results for the full sample and column II for a \nsample that excludes all developed countries, namely Canada and the US, the 15 \n  22 \nEuropean Union countries, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, Japan, New Zealand and \nAustralia. \nConsistent with a priori expectations, countries with greater exports of goods and \nservices to the European Union and Japan have a higher uptake of ISO 14001 in per \ncapita terms. The coefficient of the exports to the US variable is negative and \nstatistically significant. A higher level of transnational involvement as measured by \nFDISTOCKGDP leads to a higher number of ISO 14001 certifications. So does a \nhigher level of demand from civil society as measured by ENVIROGROUPS p.c. \nRicher countries have more ISO 14001 certified facilities per capita. Countries in \nwhich the government intervenes more in the economy have a lower certification \ncount, as do countries with higher productivity. \nAs concerns the control variables, the lagged dependent variable is highly \nsignificant and positive, thereby conforming with expectations. As anticipated, we \nfind that bigger economies have more certifications per capita, but a higher \nmanufacturing share of GDP is not related to take-up of ISO 14001. \nResults are very similar in terms of coefficient sign and statistical significance if \nthe sample is restricted to the non-developed countries (column II). The only \ndifference is that EXPEU15GDP turns insignificant in this smaller sample. This \nsuggests that our main results are not merely driven by the inclusion of developed \ncountries in the sample. \n \n< Insert Table 5 about here > \n \n  23 \nHow strong is the effect of each variable? Since variables are held in different \nunits and have different distributions the estimated coefficients cannot be compared \ndirectly with each other. However, the method of so-called (semi-)standardized \ncoefficients allows us to compare the effect of variables held in different units with \neach other. Table 6 presents the percentage increase in per capita ISO 14001 take-up \nfollowing a substantial increase in one of the explanatory variables, where we take a \none standard deviation increase in a variable to represent a \u2018substantial\u2019 increase \n(estimates refer to the full sample model). With the presence of the lagged dependent \nvariable in the model, these are to be interpreted as short-term or instantaneous \nincreases, but the ranking of variables in terms of magnitude of effect does not \nchange if we were to compute long-term changes instead. It is clear that per capita \nincome, exports to the EU, economic size and productivity are the substantively most \nimportant factors, followed by the export to Japan and the US variables. The \npenetration of the economy with foreign capital is about equally important as \nenvironmental NGO presence and the extent of government intervention in the \neconomy. The share of manufacturing is not only statistically insignificant, but also \nsubstantively unimportant. \n \n< Insert Table 6 about here > \n \nDiscussion and conclusions \nThis study seeks to advance understanding of the factors that determine take-up of \nISO 14001, the international, voluntary standard for environmental management \nsystems. To this end, it quantitatively examines the influence of several hypothesised \n  24 \ndemand- and supply-side variables believed to influence certification counts using \ndata for a panel of 142 developed and developing countries. We control for the \ndynamics of ISO 14001 take-up with the help of a lagged dependent variable which, \nas expected, is found to be highly statistically significant. Countries with a larger \neconomy as measured by total GDP also have a greater number of certified facilities \nin per capita terms. We do not know why the variable measuring exports per GDP to \nthe US is not merely statistically insignificant in line with our expectation, but instead \nsignificant with a negative coefficient. The result might simply be down to chance, \nbut in future research we want to explore in more detail whether an export orientation \ntowards the US market could have a deterrent effect on the up-take of ISO 14001. \nOverall, we find support for the commonly made suggestion that variations in \nthe take-up of ISO 14001 can be explained by differences in the incentive structures \nfacing firms. Our hypotheses linking environmental demand with certification counts \nare confirmed by the econometric estimations. Firms, in other words, are more likely \nto adopt ISO 14001 where they face strong incentives to do so.  \nGoing further, our findings lend weight to the claim that the emergence and \ndiffusion of self-regulatory initiatives is bound-up with new sources of environmental \ngovernance \u201cbeyond the state\u201d. The level of demand from civil society and market \nactors are individually statistically significant determinants of ISO 14001 certification \ncounts in our estimations. Reinforcing the findings of recent work, therefore, the \npresent study shows that non-state actors can indeed function as surrogate \n\u201cregulators\u201d encouraging firms to adopt beyond-compliance codes of conduct \n  25 \n(Rodgers, 2000; World Bank, 2000).5 Moreover, challenging critics who suggest that \ntrade and investment liberalisation are inimical to heightened environmental \ncommitment, the findings of the present research suggest that they can actually \nstrengthen it. Both the stock of investments by TNCs and exports to Japan and the EU \n(full sample only) are positively correlated with ISO 14001 certification counts. \nOf note, apart from the exports to the EU variable, these results are indifferent to \nthe inclusion of developed economies in the sample, indicating that the influence of \nmarket actors is not simply restricted to a handful of rich countries. This, of course, is \nnot to say that growing integration with the global economy is not without its \nenvironmental costs. Yet the study\u2019s findings contribute to a growing body of \nevidence which suggests that economic globalisation is associated with the diffusion \nof environmentally-beneficial policies, technologies and operating practices \n(Reppelin-Hill, 1999; Garcia-Johnson, 2000; Haufler, 2001; Mielnik & Goldemberg, \n2002). \nOur evidence additionally confirms the proposition that supply-side factors have \nshaped the uneven diffusion of ISO 14001. We find a statistically significant negative \ncorrelation between productivity and certification counts. This is consistent with \nrecent survey evidence which suggests that efficiency gains are a more important \nmotive for implementing environmental management systems in developing countries \n(Tanner, 1998; Raines, 2002). \n                                                 \n5\n Interestingly, like Damiana et al. (2003) we find that environmental NGOs play a more important \nrole in developing countries than in developed ones. \n  26 \nThe present study furthermore provides support for the positive relationship \nbetween income and number of ISO certifications.  Given that we control for \ndemand-side dynamics (i.e., demand for environmental quality from civil and market \nactors) using our environmental NGOs variable, this result is most likely a product of \nsupply-side influences. Specifically, it suggests that firms in low income countries \nmay indeed find it more costly and difficult to implement and certify ISO 14001 \ncompliant management systems, presumably because of a lack of internal (weak \nfinances, low levels of technological know-how, etc.) or external capabilities (limited \navailability of consultancy firms, third-party accreditation bodies, etc.). Further work \nis required, however, to clarify the respective role and importance of demand- and \nsupply-side factors on ISO certifications. \nFinally, the findings of our study lend measured support to recent conceptual \naccounts which suggest that the evolution and diffusion of private environmental law \nhas gone hand-in-hand with the \u201cretreat of the state\u201d (Finger & Tamiotti, 1999; \nBendell, 2000; Stewart, 2001). Lower levels of state involvement are, according to \nour estimations, significantly associated with higher certification counts. \nUnfortunately, our analysis does not allow us to say whether ISO 14001 exists as a \nsubstitute or complement to public law and regulation, although they hint towards the \nlatter. Clearly, a major challenge for future research is to investigate this question \nusing a measurable proxy for the stringency of domestic environmental regulation. To \nour knowledge, however, no adequate measure currently exists to perform such an \nanalysis. \nWhat does our study suggest for policy-makers charged with accelerating the \ndiffusion of self-regulatory initiatives? We point to two key areas of leverage. The \n  27 \nfirst centres on supply chains. A number of authors have speculated that  \nenvironmental requirements in export markets are capable of stimulating the up-take \nof ISO 14001 (e.g., Cosbey, 2002; Rock, 2002). Our results support this thesis and \nsuggest that public policy could play a role in the global diffusion of EMS activity by \nencouraging firms to specify ISO 14001 as a routine contractual requirement. These \ninclude, of particular significance, major TNCs whose regional and\/or international \nnetwork of suppliers means that they are especially well-placed to promote \ncertification activity in both domestic and foreign markets.   \nThe second point of leverage for policy-makers, meanwhile, is civil society. \nAccording to our regression analysis demand from environmental NGOs has been a \nsignificant factor driving firms to certify to the ISO standard. We believe that there is \nconsiderable scope for governments to strengthen these pressures by publicly \ndisseminating information on the take-up of standardised EMS.  Similar approaches \nhave proved successful when applied to pollution release data (Tietenberg, 1998; \nWorld Bank, 2000) and offer a low cost means for public regulators to harness the \nregulatory functions of civil society.  \nYet, recognising the potential difficulties faced by firms in lower income \ncountries in implementing and certifying ISO 14001, these and other demand-side \ninitiatives will need to be accompanied by supply-side ones aimed at providing \nfinancial, technical and managerial assistance. Failure to do so might see many small- \nand medium-scale firms excluded from supply chains, with potentially negative \nconsequences for local economic development. \n \n \n  28 \nAcknowledgement \nWe would like to thank three anonymous referees for many helpful and constructive \ncomments. \n \nReferences \nBansal, P, Bogner, W C, 2002, \"Deciding on ISO 14001: Economics, Institutions and \nContext\" Long Range Planning, 35 269-290 \nBeck, N, Katz, J K, 1995, \"What to Do (and Not to Do) with Time-Series Cross-\nSection Data\" American Political Science Review, 89 (3) 634-647 \nBendell, J. 2000, \u201cIntroduction: Working with Stakeholder Pressure for Sustainable \nDevelopment\u201d, in Terms for Endearment: Business, NGOs and Sustainable \nDevelopment Ed J Bendell (Greenleaf, Sheffield) pp 14-29 \nChang-Xing, D 1999, \"ISO 14001: The Severe Challenge for China.
