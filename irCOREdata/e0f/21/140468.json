It is ideally suited to load\nbearing structures intended to be made via the dry-fabric\/liquid resin moulding\nprocesses. The process involves the insertion of a threaded needle into a loose dry fabric\nor bindered preform and its removal from the fabric along the same trajectory (see\nFig.1). The \u2018tuft\u2019 of thread relies on friction from the fabric itself and\/or hold provided\nby underlying ancillary material (e.g. foam) to remain in place. The loop of thread is not\nlocked in place and, given that the samples are made from woven fabric, any additional\ncrimp due to the insertion of the tufts can be considered insignificant. It is to be noted\nthat the process requires only one-sided access to the piece.\nInformation available in the published literature is currently limited to technical\ninformation on the tufting process itself [1] and to general comparisons of tufting\nagainst other forms of stitching [2-4] or other forms of Z-direction reinforcement [5].\nThere is currently no published database relating to the mechanical performance of\ntufted composites. In contrast to this, much work has been done in the past on more\nconventional forms of stitching of fabrics for structural composites and significant\namount of information has been generated and published [6-13]. Some problem have\nbeen encountered in terms of manufacturing complexity, especially in large composite\nstructures and the crimping effect of the locked stitches appears to result in an\nunacceptable reduction of the in-plane properties of stitched composites.\n3The present paper describes the manufacturing processes involved in the preparation of\nglass and carbon thread tufted carbon fabric\/epoxy resin samples and concentrates on\nthe evaluation of the compression-after-impact (CAI) and of the in-plane tensile\nproperties of the cured composites. Preliminary results of measurement of the\ndelamination crack growth resistance of a relatively thick, tufted carbon NCF\/epoxy\nlaminate are given.\nThe tufting process\nThe tufting technology is based on the ancient methods of carpet making. The novel\naspects involve the development of specialised continuous yarn tufting threads,\ncompatible with the liquid resin moulding type processes for composites manufacture\nand with the subsequent mechanical and durability performance demands on the final\ncomposite. In line with the rising expectation of cost effective manufacturing in the\ncomposites industry, the tufting process has been automated. The system used in the\npresent work (see Movie 1) consists of a commercial tufting head (KSL KL150),\ninterfaced to a Kawasaki 6-axis robot arm (FS 20N). The trajectory tracking has been\nachieved using AS machine programming language designed specifically for use with\nKawasaki robot controllers, and the dedicated KCWIN software from Kawasaki.\nFigure 2 shows detail of the tufting needle arrangement. The needle diameter is 2mm.\nThis size is required for robustness of the needle in repeated application but is roughly\ncomparable with the typical \u2018unit cell\u2019 dimensions of a dry continuous fibre preform. If\nloosely woven dry preforms are used, then the size of the needle seems to pose little\nproblem in term of fibre breakage, as the fibres are able to move out of the way of the\nneedle. However, significant fibre damage can be expected to result in the tufting of\nhighly bindered preforms. The effect of such damage will be a reduction in the in-plane\n4strength of the final composite. Our experience to date indicates that knitted fabrics are\nunsuitable for use with this technology, whilst woven fabrics are relatively easy to tuft\nand the so called non-crimped-fibre (NCF) fabrics appear ideally suited for tufting.\nThe machine set up is capable of tufting at rates of up to 500 tufts per minute. Rates up\nto 250 tufts per minute have been tested successfully in our laboratory on 5mm thick\nbindered preforms, however, all the results reported this study correspond to a tufting\nrate of 50 tufts per minute. The insertions were orthogonal to the plane of the preform,\nin a 3mmx3mm square tufting pattern. Figure 3 shows the top-side of a tufted preform\nand the underside loops, revealed after removal of the preform from the support bed.\nTable1 summarises the attributes of the two commercial threads used in the present\nwork. The 3-yarn glass fibre thread has been used in these types of applications for\nsome time, whereas the particular 2-yarn carbon fibre thread grade used has been\ndeveloped only recently [14]. The threads were tested for tensile strength in the\nun-impregnated form, using a Zwick Z010 tensile tester and standard rope specimen\ngrips from Zwick.\nThe tufts were held in place on the underside of the preform by using an 8mm thick\nsilicone based backing layer. Two different materials were utilised: a silicone rubber\nfrom Dow Corning\u00ae (Silastic\u00ae 3481 with Silastic\u00ae 81T curing agent) or a silicone\nfoam from Samco\u00ae (SIL16). The first of these is tougher and guarantees a better grip\non the thread whereas the second is cheaper and more suitable for thinner and more\n\u2018delicate\u2019 threads. An additional nylon film (see Fig. 2) was placed between the dry\nfabric stack and the silicone rubber or foam bed, to facilitate the removal of the tufted\nstack from the support prior to the infusion with resin.\n5An obvious question arises as to whether the tuft loops should be removed from the\npanel prior to resin infusion and, if so, how. In the work reported here the tuft loops\nwere left intact, leading to the formation of a thin (under half a millimetre) resin rich\nlayer, containing the flattened tuft loops, on one side of the cured composite panel.\nThe geometric arrangement of the tufts or blocks of tufts within a panel is an evident\nprocess parameter. In this early work we report results obtained by the use of a simple\nsquare tufting pattern, with tuft centre-to-tuft centre spacing of 3mm. This choice was\nprompted by desire to achieve some form of a comparison with our previous work on\nZ-pinning of prepreg laminates, in which similar areal densities of the Z-direction\nreinforcement had been used [15].\nMaterials and methods\nSamples were made from woven 5 harness satin carbon fibre fabric, 373gsm, 6K\n(WEAV-RITE), supplied by Cytec Engineered Materials. The fabric stack was made up\nfrom 8 plies of this fabric, arranged as a symmetric 0\/90\u00b0 lay-up. The dry fabric stacks,\ncontaining defined regions with and without tufts, were placed in a fixed dimension\nrectangular flat plate Resin Transfer Moulding tool and infused with Cycom\u00ae 977-20\nresin under 2 bar pressure. Upon successful completion of the resin fill, the panels were\ncured in the tool at 180\u00b0C for 185 minutes. On completion of the cure the nominal panel\nthickness was 3.35mm, with a theoretical fibre volume fraction of 50%.\nThe tensile tests were carried out following BS EN ISO 527-4:1997 standard, on\nparallel sided 25mm wide specimens. The length of the tufted area was selected to be\n6longer than the gauge length, with the tabs covering part of the tufted portion of the\nspecimen. At least six specimens were tested for each sample type and the average\nstrength was evaluated by taking into account only those specimens which failed within\nthe gauge section. The \u2018top side\u2019 (no loops) specimen surface was spray-painted with a\nspeckle pattern of black dots on a white background in order to obtain a full strain field\nmeasurement via a LIMESS GmbH Digital Image Correlation system [16]. Two 1.4\nMega Pixels digital cameras, operating at a fixed frequency, monitored the displacement\nof the random dots. In the post-processing stage, image correlation algorithms calculate\nthe strain maps by comparing successive images and following the evolution of the\ndisplacement of the dots. The average strain was measured over the central area of the\ngauge section of the specimen in order to minimise any edge effect.\nCompression after impact tests were carried out on 102x152x3.35mm specimens. All of\nthese specimens were obtained from a single infused panel, thus ensuring that they all\nhad the same thickness, fibre volume fraction and cure history. There were control\nspecimens and specimens containing a 50mmx50mm central square block of tufts (GF\nor CF) with a 3mmx3mm pattern. This size of the tufted area was selected so that the\ndamage area due to impact did not extend beyond the tufted region. They were clamped\nat four points according to the Boeing BSS7260 standard for CAI and pre-impacted at a\nsingle energy level of 15J, with the 20mm diameter hemispherical impactor of a Rosand\nInstrumented Falling Weight System. They were then C-scanned prior to being\nsubjected to compression within a Boeing CAI test fixture. Three or four specimens\nwere tested in each case. The C-scan is able to indicate the presence of the tufts (Fig.\n74a) in the non-impacted specimens and the damage created by the 15J impact (Fig. 4b)\nis visualised with the help of image processing software (Fig. 4c).\nStandard double cantilever beam (DCB) specimens (BS ISO 15024:2001) were\nprepared for the evaluation of the delamination propagation resistance of control and\ntufted coupons. These samples were manufactured from the same materials and by the\nsame manufacturing methods as in the above described tests, with cured plate thickness\nof 3.35mm. The first line of tufts had been positioned 15mm beyond the edge of the\ncrack starter film. It was subsequently found necessary to use considerably thicker DCB\nspecimens and to reduce the areal density of through-the-thickness reinforcement, in\norder for the delamination to propagate in the correct plane of the specimen. For these\nspecimens, carbon Sigmatex MC904 quasi-isotropic non-crimped fabric was used,\ntufted with the glass tufting thread in a 4mmx4mm square pattern. Given the size\nlimitations of our RTM tool, these much thicker plates were vacuum infused with a low\nviscosity three component epoxy resin, to arrive at a cured thickness of 6mm. It should\nbe noted that, under vacuum infusion process conditions, the local perturbations to\nfabric permeability become important. The blocks of tufts can cause localised air\ntrapping when the preform is infused by \u2018in-plane\u2019 resin flow but facilitate impregnation\nvia a transverse resin flow. The impregnation conditions have to be carefully controlled\nto take account of this added complexity.\nResults\nThe overall quality and the mesostructure of tufted specimens were analysed via optical\nmicroscopy of polished cross-sections of the cured composite. The inclination of the\ntufts remains reasonably orthogonal to the laminate plane after curing, as shown in\n8Figures 5a and 5b. The glass thread tuft cross-section (Fig. 5c) is circular whereas in the\ncarbon thread tuft the yarns appear to remain well separated in a 4-lobe shape (Fig. 5d).\nThe total carbon fibre volume fraction of the panels was determined by an acid\ndigestion technique and the average value was 51.5%. In those tensile test specimens\ntufted with the glass thread, the total theoretical volume fraction of glass was calculated\nas 7.7% of the final cured composite. The actual glass fibre content of such tufted\nspecimens, determined from the acid digestion data and the detailed geometry of the\nspecimens, was 7.9%. In terms of the effects on the mechanical properties, it is more\ncorrect to consider only the \u2018functional\u2019 portion of glass thread, neglecting the surface\nstitches and the loops contained in the 300 \u2013 400\u03bcm thick external resin-rich layer. On\nthis basis, the functional glass fibre content drops to 4.4% of the sample volume, for a\n3mmx3mm tufting pattern.\nFigure 6 shows representative stress vs. strain curves of control and glass fibre tufted\nsamples tested in tension. Control samples exhibit a linear response almost to failure.\nThe initial slopes of the two lines are indistinguishable, giving a Young\u2019s Modulus of\n55GPa, but the behaviour of the tufted sample shows a deviation from linearity at a\nstrain of 0.35%. The ultimate tensile strength of the samples is reduced from 477 (+\/-\n25) MPa to 430 (+\/-16) MPa by tufting. This translates to a 10% reduction. In the tufted\nsamples the crack always propagates along a line of tufts, transverse to the longitudinal\naxis of the specimen. Several mechanisms could be responsible for weakening the area\naround each tuft. Apart from the expected localised breakage of the preform fibres due\nto the needle penetration itself, post mortem analysis of tested specimens also revealed\nthe presence of small resin pockets and voids around the tufts (Fig. 7).\n9The falling weight impact tests recorded in Figure 8 demonstrate that the maximum load\nexperienced during the impact on glass thread and carbon thread tufted samples is\nincreased by 24% and 28% respectively when compared to control samples.\nThe apparent total extent of the damage in the central region of the specimen does not\nchange significantly between the control and the tufted samples. However, analysis of\nthe images obtained by processing the C-scan patterns reveals that delamination in the\ncontrol samples usually propagates along the main directions of the fabric fibres\n(0\u00b0\/90\u00b0), giving a characteristic and well defined cross shape to the damage region (see\nFig. 4.e), whilst in the case of tufted samples the shape of the damage area is more\ncircular and fewer delaminated planes are observed. Accordingly, the CAI strength of\nthese samples is increased by 25% and 27% in the presence of a central tufted block,\nusing glass and carbon threads respectively (see Table 2).\nIn the 3.35mm thick DCB samples the delamination did not propagate into the tufted\nregion, instead the specimens failed by flexural failure of the beam arms. It was also\nimpossible to propagate the centre plane delamination when the equivalent samples\nwere stiffened by bonding of 6mm thick aluminium sheets on each side.\nIn the case of the 6mm thick NCF based samples two of the tufted specimens still failed\nby breakage of the beam arms, but from the remaining samples it was possible to obtain\na quantified comparison of the delamination resistance curves under Mode I loading for\ncontrol and tufted samples (see Fig. 9). There was no evidence of tuft pull-out during\nthe test and subsequent examination of the fracture surfaces showed broken tufts.\nDiscussion and Conclusions\nThe technique of robotic reinforcement of dry carbon fabric stacks by glass or carbon\nfibre threads has proved to be relatively easy to introduce in the laboratory environment.\n10\nApart from the issues of interfacing and programming of the robot arm and the\ncommercial tufting head, the major practical challenges are in ensuring sufficient\nanchorage of the tuft loops on the underside of the tufted preform and in avoiding\nfrequent thread breakage. The latter is achieved by initial selection of a suitable thread,\ncoupled with suitable selection of the needle eye shape and a suitable tufting speed.\nLess frequent thread breakage is observed at higher tufting speeds.\nThe observed reduction in the ultimate tensile strength of the tufted samples is a\nmeasure of the extent of fibre damage caused by the tufting process; in our particular\ncase a drop of 10% of the original strength for the addition of 4 to 5% by volume of\n\u2018functional\u2019 glass tufting thread in the z-direction. This reduction in the in-plane\nstrength is comparable to what has been observed in Z-pinned laminates [17,18].\nHowever, the values quoted here cannot be expected to be a universal quantification of\nthe effect for tufted composites as this is likely to be dependent on the thread size and\ntype, pattern grid, nature of the fabric, level of binder used, size of the needle and the\ntufting speed.\nA drop-down in tensile stiffness of some 5% might also have been expected, based on\nsimple \u2018dilution\u2019 effect of the presence of the Z-direction reinforcement [18]. This has\nnot been detected within experimental error. As shown in Figure 6, after the initial co-\nincidence with the control sample data, the stress-strain curve for the tufted composite\nbecomes non-linear at a tensile stress of about 150MPa. This effect is not found with the\ncontrol material. It is interesting to note that this non-linear behaviour has also been\nobserved at about the same stress level in the tensile stress-strain curves for 3D woven\ncomposites with through-the-thickness reinforcement. The deflection of the curve is\n11\nattributed to plastic straightening of load-bearing tows that have been crimped by the\nthrough-thickness reinforcement [19,20].\nAs in Z-pinned laminated samples [17,18] the presence of the tufts would be expected\nto increase significantly the resistance to propagation of a delamination crack in our\nsamples. The significant increase in the CAI performance of the tufted samples must, in\npart, be due to the increased resistance to delamination. Our initial crack opening mode\ndelamination tests did not provide any useful data, apart from demonstrating just how\nmuch stronger the tufted samples are. It was necessary to increase the tuft-to-tuft\nspacing from 3 to 4mm and use a 6mm thick specimen before valid Mode I\ndelamination failures were obtained. For the particular specimen configuration used, the\npresence of this local reinforcement results in an order of magnitude increase in the\ndelamination propagation resistance.\nThe early investigation presented here indicates an attractive balance of mechanical\nperformance in the tufted composite samples which is comparable to, and possibly\nsuperior to, the performance achievable by Z-Fibre\u00ae pinning of prepreg laminates\n[5,7,17]. It remains to be clarified what damage resisting mechanisms are responsible\nfor the significant delamination suppression in the tufted specimens, especially noting\nthe apparent absence of tuft pull-out from the laminates. In Z-pinned composites the\nfrictional pull-out of the Z-pins is a major energy absorbing mechanism, accounting for\ntheir crack bridging action under crack opening displacement.\nThe question of how to deal with the external loops of thread produced by the tufting\nprocess is unique to this technology. If, as in this work, the loops are left and\n12\nsubsequently impregnated by resin, then any mechanical properties measured\nnecessarily become sample specific. As with other forms of Z-direction reinforcement,\nit is important to realise that the absolute value of the change in any given mechanical\nproperty, as a result of tufting, will be a function of the specimen geometry as well as of\nthe tufting parameters. Future parametric studies, such as effects of tuft type, size,\nspacing, overall sample geometry and even eventual structural response, will probably\nbest be carried out via carefully validated modelling. To this end work has started on the\ndevelopment of suitable models, along the same principles as modelling methods\npreviously applied successfully to Z-pinned composites [21,22].\nAcknowledgements\nThe study presented here was funded by EPSRC via Cranfield University IMRC and by\nBAE SYSTEMS (CAFV Programme).
