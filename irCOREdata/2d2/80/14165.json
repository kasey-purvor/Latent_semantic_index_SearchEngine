The development of this framework is based on the needs of a research\nproject in which computer network concepts are studied in an internationally distrib-\nuted project-based course. In the course, the students work in virtual teams, collabo-\nrating using different learning technologies. The aim of the framework is to provide a\ntool that researchers can use to analyse and describe learning within a subject area,\ntaking account of the complex learning environment in which this takes place and\nleading to insights into how the students experience this learning environment. To\nachieve this goal, it is crucial to understand the role of the learning environment from\nthe students\u2019 perspective, since changes in a course that are not related to students\nperceptions run the risk of being useless or even counter-productive.\n*Department of Information Technology, Uppsala University, PO Box 325, SE-75105 Uppsala,\nSweden.

Berglund\n    The focus on the learner\u2019s experience suggests the use of a phenomenographic\nresearch approach (Marton & Booth, 1997), since phenomenography aims at reveal-\ning learners\u2019 relationship with, or experience of, different phenomena in the learning\nenvironment and in the subject area. The different ways in which phenomena under\ninvestigation are experienced (or understood) are highlighted in a phenomenographic\nresearch project, while other issues are relegated to the background. In this way, the\nresearcher gains insights into the different constituents that, in their interplay, create\nthe experience of learning in a particular environment; however, they risk loosing\nsight of the whole picture. The danger is that the researcher may gain a fragmented\nview in which the constituents of the environment are seen in isolation. To address\nthis issue, the framework proposed here uses concepts drawn from activity theory\n(Engestr\u00f6m, 1987) to study the phenomenographic outcomes in greater detail. Activ-\nity theory serves as a vehicle for the researcher to integrate the outcome of phenom-\nenographic analyses to provide a more holistic account. Importantly, if activity theory\nwere to be used without reference to the phenomenographic results, the learner\u2019s\nperspective would be lost, and, as consequence, the aims of the research could not be\naddressed. It is thus a combination of these two approaches, where phenomenogra-\nphy is extended with elements of activity theory, that is advocated here.\nThe remainder of this article is structured as follows. Phenomenography, which\nprovides the theoretical basis for this project, is described in the next section, and is\nfollowed by a discussion of some elements of activity theory. I then present the\nresearch framework and a case study that is used to illustrate its application. Finally,\nsome implications of the framework are discussed.\nAn introduction to phenomenography and activity theory\nPhenomenography\nPhenomenography offers the possibility of investigating issues related to students\u2019\nvarying experiences of their learning and their situations. With its object of study\nbeing the relationship between a learner and a phenomenon, the outcome becomes a\ndescription of this relationship as a limited set of qualitatively different ways in which\nthe phenomena are experienced, or understood, by some learners. Variation is in\nfocus in phenomenography; individuals are understood as being \u2018carriers\u2019 of different\nways of experiencing something or else of fragments of a collective way of experienc-\ning it. The results are then interpreted at a collective level, without relating a partic-\nular way of understanding something to a specific individual or to groups of\nindividuals.\nWith this as a point of departure, individual learning is interpreted, or defined, as\nacquiring the capacity to see something in a qualitatively new way. Learning, under-\nstood in this way, is shaped both by the learners and the phenomena they study. The\nrole of the researcher is to analyse and describe this relationship, that is, to reveal the\nvariation in the ways in which the students experience phenomena. Both the students\nand the concepts that they study are present in the outcome, which is a description of\n A framework to study learning in a complex learning environment\n \n67\n                  the researcher\u2019s understanding of the various ways in which the students understand\nsome concepts.\nA strong focus on the content of the subject area, giving rise to the possibility of\ninfluencing education within that field, has been promoted by several authors as a\nkey feature of phenomenography (for example: Berglund, 2002a, in computer\nnetworks; Booth, 1992, in programming; Cope, 2000, in information systems; Pang,\n2003, in business economy). The discussion in Berglund (2002a), concerning\nstudents\u2019 learning of a particular network protocol, can serve as an illustration. In\nthis paper I argue that a teacher who understands the different ways in which\nstudents perceive the phenomenon being taught can use these insights as a tool to\nimprove her teaching.\nIn the phenomenographic tradition, issues related to the learning environment and\nto its role in learning are normally relegated to the background, since \u201cthe analysis\ndeliberately strips away contextual features of the data in order to focus clearly and\nexclusively on the phenomenon\u201d (Adawi et al., 2001, p. 82). For the current project,\nwhere learning within the subject area is studied both within, and as a part of, a partic-\nular learning environment, the use of phenomenography alone as a guide for the\nresearch is therefore not sufficient. For this reason, I propose a phenomenographic\napproach that is informed by elements of activity theory as a unifying framework for\nthis kind of research.\nActivity theory\nThe elements of activity theory, as they are employed in this project, serve to describe,\nanalyse and explain human activities, such as learning, as integrated parts of an envi-\nronment. The theoretical aspects of activity theory are based on the interpretations of\nEngestr\u00f6m (1987) as well as other researchers in this tradition (Bannon, 1997;\nBellamy, 1996; Kaptelinin et al., 1995; Kuutti, 1996; Nardi, 1996). Activity theory is\nbriefly presented here and is further described by Berglund (2002b), with a focus on\nthe needs of this phenomenographic research project.\nWith an activity theoretical approach, learning can be understood as being\nintegrated in a larger system that considers the socially based nature of human\nactivity. Activity theory serves here as a \u201cclarifying and descriptive tool rather than a\nstrongly predictive theory\u201d (Nardi, 1996, p. 7).\nAn activity system describes the interaction between a subject (in this study, a\nstudent), and an object (a programming task, or a understanding a computer science\nconcept). The activity, as a whole, is directed towards this object, which is trans-\nformed into an outcome. This transformation of the object is the reason for the exist-\nence of the activity. The subject interacts with the object through tools, both physical\n(such as a computer) and intellectual (abstract computer science concepts). The\nactivity is, however, larger than the tool-mediated relation between a subject and an\nobject. It is an integrated part of a collective activity involving a community that shares\nthe same object (other students taking the same course, university staff). The rela\u2013\ntionship between the subject and the community are constrained by rules. The term\n 68\n \nA. Berglund\n               \u2018rules\u2019 must be understood in a broad sense, including aspects as diverse as the legal\nsystems, cultural or social rules for people\u2019s interaction as well as the rules, or habits\nthat have developed within the current activity. The relationship between the\ncommunity and the object itself is described by the division of labour.\nThe components and their relationships are frequently presented graphically, as\nshown in Figure 1. The sub-triangles describe different aspects of the broader\nactivity and can in themselves often be analysed as activity systems (Engestr\u00f6m,\n1987). The sub-triangle in the top would then describe production, while the\nlower left sub-triangle describes exchange (or communication). The lower right trian-\ngle expresses the distribution activity. Finally, the middle triangle (which in\nEngestr\u00f6m\u2019s model, following a Marxist tradition, is labelled consumption) is here\ndenoted development.\nAn activity system (developed from Engestr\u00f6m, 1987, p. 78)\u2018qAn activity is continuously constructed and reconstructed by the individuals\nwithin the system. In this way, the activity becomes more than the sum of individ-\nual discrete actions, and the individual becomes inseparably intertwined with the\nactivity.\nAs the object is what motivates the existence of the activity, the activity in its turn\ngives \u201cmeaning to seemingly random individual events\u201d (Engestr\u00f6m, 1993, p. 65).\nThat is, an activity is a context in which the participating individuals and the different\nevents are integrated parts. With this approach, it is impossible to study a part of the\nactivity separated from the whole system. The activity as a whole becomes the unit of\nanalysis. This does not imply that the activity is a homogenous and harmonious\nentity; on the contrary, with its multi-voiced character and its embedded history, it\ncontains different, often contradictory, expressions and events that serve as a ground\nfor inner conflicts. These conflicts, in their turn, are important forces in the develop-\nment of the activity.\n \n \nFigure 1. An activity system (developed from Engestr\u00f6m, 1987, p. 78)\n A framework to study learning in a complex learning environment\n \n69\n            Using the two approaches together\nAn extensive literature survey has indicated that only a few research projects use\nphenomenography and activity theory within the same project. Significant work in\nthis context includes that of \u00c5berg-Bengtsson (1998) concerning children learning\ngraphs, Gordon (1998) concerning students\u2019 learning of statistics, Coupland and\nCrawford (2002) concerning computer-based tools in learning mathematics and\nHult\u00e9n and Booth (2002) concerning learning within a collaborative project-based\ndistance course.\nThese studies all combining the research approaches in different ways. However,\nthey use phenomenography for aspects that are close to, or perceived by, the learners,\nwhile the role of activity theory is to analyse and\/or describe a context for this learning.\nHult\u00e9n and Booth takes a stand similar to the one presented here: they adopt a\nphenomenographic approach illuminated by elements of activity theory, while \u00c5berg-\nBengtsson, as well as Gordon, choose to let the two approaches serve as different\nlenses that illuminate separate aspects of learning. Coupland and Crawford, finally,\npropose a predominantly activity theoretical approach, where results from methods\ninspired by phenomenography offer data for the activity theoretical analysis.\nThe focus in activity theory on a particular situation, seen as a whole, implies that\nthe actions taken or performed by individuals within the activity form an important\nbasis for the data used in the analyses. In a phenomenographic study, on the other\nhand, which aims to reveal the different ways in which something is experienced, the\nlearners\u2019 own accounts play important roles. This discrepancy is clearly voiced by\nEkeblad and Bond (1994) in terms of a difference between an externalist perspective,\nwhich leads researchers to observe events and to analyze them from within their\ntheoretical and methodological frameworks, and an experiential perspective, in which\nthe researcher seeks to see events as the actors experience them.\nThe research framework presented here serves as a tool to study the experience of\nlearning in the perceived context by applying an experiential perspective on the\nstudents\u2019 learning environment. Hence the phenomenographic foundations are kept\nin the proposed research framework, even when studying the context of the learning,\nand the potential conflicts between the approaches are avoided.\nExtending the use of phenomenography\nMarton and Booth (1997, p. 113) define the research object of phenomenographic\nresearch in the following terms: \nThe unit of phenomenographic research\u2014a way of experiencing something\u2014[\u2026] is an\ninternal relationship between the experiencer and the experienced.\nTaking this as the point of departure for the research framework, the issue of relating\nit to, or extending it with, the experienced context becomes crucial.\nAn activity is, as described earlier, a theoretical entity, discerned and described by\nthe researcher who aims to study the context within which the subjects (in this study:\nstudents) and the object (what is learnt) are integrated parts. Someone, a subject,\n 70\n \nA. Berglund\n     cannot experience the complete whole at a particular point of time, since, as Marton\nand Booth point out, different parts or aspects of the world are within the focus of the\nattention at different times. A student can, for example, focus at a particular moment\non some aspect of a concept within the course content, such as a networking protocol,\nwhilst another issue, such as concerns about decision-taking in the team, are relegated\nto the background. Later, focus might shift to decisions concerning the distribution\nof work, with the concepts of network protocols residing in the background. The\nstudents\u2019 relationships to these phenomena within the environment are thus dynam-\nically changing.\nBoth learning the course content (here network protocols) and experiencing other\nphenomena related to the course (for example, a team structure) are important for a\nresearcher to describe and analyse if he\/she are to understand the students\u2019 experience\nof their studies in a particular setting. Both are needed to understand the complex\nrelationship between the learning outcome and the experience of the learning\nenvironment.\nIn the framework presented here, the students\u2019 experience of these phenomena,\nwhether directly related to the learning objectives or not, are analysed in the phenom-\nenographic tradition. The outcome of a phenomenographic analysis is sets of categories\nof description, where each set describes the experiences of a particular phenomenon\nfound within a team, and each category describes a certain way in which the phenom-\nenon is understood.\nThese categories and their relationships are then further analysed based on\nelements drawn from activity theory. The outcome of the \u2018pure\u2019 phenomenographic\nanalysis is thus not the final outcome of the research project. In addition to its role\nas an outcome in itself, this phenomenographic account serves as a material for\nanalysing the learning in a particular situation as it is perceived or experienced by its\nparticipants. The final outcome of the analysis consists thus of a description of\nthe students\u2019 experience of learning of the subject area within a particular course\nsetting, as it is experienced.\nMethodology: a phenomenographic analysis of an activity\nAs briefly indicated above, the analysis is performed in two steps. First, variations in\nthe students\u2019 experience of different phenomena in the learning environment are\nanalysed and described, following the phenomenographic tradition. As a second\nstep the analysis is advanced by means of some intellectual tools related to activity\ntheory. Here the outcome space of the phenomenographic analysis is associated\nwith different components of an activity system. In this way, the researcher gain\nmeans to further explore his\/her phenomenographic results by deploying concepts\nfrom activity theory. The aim is to create the potential to capture, analyse and\ndescribe the variation in the participants\u2019 experience of the whole.\nAs a starting point for this analysis, each category of description is associated by the\nresearcher with one or more component(s) of an activity system. This association\ndemands of the researcher that he\/she \u2018goes inside\u2019 the activity and explores it from\n A framework to study learning in a complex learning environment\n \n71\n                the participants\u2019 perspective. Through such associations, each component of the\nactivity comes to have some phenomenographic categories related to it that together\nindicate the variation in how this particular component is experienced by the subjects.\nAs will be demonstrated in the case study, the various categories related to a particular\nphenomenon can be associated to different components, and the categories at each\ncomponent can, as a consequence, contain descriptions of various phenomena.\nThe activity system, now describing the various ways in which the learning situation\nis experienced by its participants, is further analysed by deploying some intellectual\ntools of activity theory. To structure such an analysis, it is useful to base the analysis\non the three different levels of the concept of context within phenomenographic\nresearch, which we introduce in Adawi et al (2002):  \n1. The experienced context of the individual describes the relationship between a\nphenomenon and its context, and is discussed as follows. During a \u201cphenomeno-\ngraphic interview, some aspects of the phenomenon come into focus, while others\nremain in the background. The phenomenon is thus experienced against and\ninterwoven with an experienced context, what we can refer to as the experienced\ncontext of the individual\u201d (italics in original).\n2. The experienced context of the collective describes the interplay between utterances of\ndifferent individuals. \u201cWhen analysing the interviews, the researcher finds that\nlight is shed on some utterance made by one interviewee by reading it against the\nbackground of the context deduced or assumed by the researcher from reading an\ninterview extract by another interviewee. Switching between these two perspec-\ntives allows the researcher to let an aspect of a phenomenon as experienced by one\nparticipant interplay with an expression of an experienced context that originates\nfrom another participant\u201d.\n3. The experienced context of the researcher describes the researcher\u2019s relationship to the\nobject of his\/her research: \u201cit can be claimed that when engaged in a phenomeno-\ngraphic study on learning the researcher stands in the same relationship to the\nobject of research as the learner stands to the object of learning. The object of\nresearch is embedded in a context, and this context can be said to be what lends\nmeaning to the object\u201d.\nThese distinctions, which are based on an analysis of who the experiencer is, are here\nextended to encompass the concepts of an activity system. The phenomenographic\noutcome space, now related to the components of an activity system, can be analysed\nin the following ways: \n1. At the individual level, case studies are made where individuals are studied in the\nlight of the activity. Relations and tensions in the different ways in which an\nindividual experiences a learning environment give the researcher a \u2018feel\u2019 for the\nindividual in the activity.\n2. At the collective level, the inner tensions are described and analysed. As stated\nearlier, the tensions within a system are its source of development and change.\nAnalysed in this way, the tensions between and within the experienced constituents\n 72\n \nA. Berglund\n      are discriminated and discerned, offering a way to understand the dynamics of the\nlearning processes in the team.\n3. At the researcher\u2019s level, a further phenomenographic analysis can be performed by\nreturning to the interview excerpts that now, through the phenomenographic\ncategories, are related to a particular component. These interview excerpts can be\nanalysed again, using the component and the earlier analyses as a background.\nThe new analyses can be structured to reveal aspects related to the component of\nthe activity in question and to those phenomena that originally, through the\ndifferent categories, fed into the description of the component. By performing\nthis analysis, the researcher can gain insights into the learners\u2019 experience of a\nparticular component of the activity.\nAnalyses at these three levels, taken together, offer to researchers and course organ-\nisers tools that can be used for understanding learning in real situations as experienced\nby the participants.\nBringing the research framework into play: a case study\nAn example from the on-going project will serve as a case study and will illustrate how\nthe framework can be used by a researcher as a vehicle to draw conclusions about the\nstudents\u2019 experience of their learning environment. The results presented here are not\nthe final result of the research project. Instead, the case study shows the framework\n\u2018in action\u2019 and thus offers insights in the methodology rather than the outcome.\nIn the course that serves as the core for this research project advanced students,\nmajoring in computer science, work in teams of six. Each team consists of three\nmembers from a Swedish university (Uppsala University) and three from the USA\n(Grand Valley State University) and was assigned the task to jointly produce a\nsoftware package intended to control a hardware setup, in the form of a motorized\nand computerized toy, from any web-browser. (See Figure 2, from Berglund, 2002a;\nThe aim of the game is to move a steel ball on the board from a starting point to a\nfinal point. The knobs are used to tilt the board and in this way move the ball.) The\ntask is considered to be hard and demanding both by students and teachers. To reach\na solution the team has to work as a unit, using different Internet-based tools for their\ncommunication (Daniels, 1999).\nA Brio labyrinth and a modified version with a camera and motors added.\nFigure 2. A Brio labyrinth and a modified version with a camera and motors added\n A framework to study learning in a complex learning environment\n \n73\n      The results presented here are based on interviews with 15 students: 8 in Sweden\nand 7 in the USA. They were selected to represent diversity in background factors\nsuch as age, previous educational background, earlier study results within computer\nscience and factors obtained from a background questionnaire (expectations about\nthe project work and their own contribution to the group work, motivation to take this\nparticular course and to study computer science in general). The aim of the selection\nwas to attain a rich phenomenographic outcome space, where different voices about\nthe phenomena under investigation were heard and from which the researcher could\ndiscern and described a nuanced picture of relevant experiences within a cohort. The\nstudents were interviewed at two occasions about their understanding of computer\nscience concepts relevant to the project as well as their experience of taking this\nparticular course in its internationally distributed setting (Berglund, 2002a).\nThe experience of being a team member\nMembership in a team is one of the more important factors constituting a student\u2019s\nexperience of his\/her learning environment. What it means to be a member of a partic-\nular team is settled in a continuous interplay between an individual and his\/her team.\nSuch relationships are dynamic: the relationships between the actors, as well as the\nactors themselves, change continuously. An example can illustrate this interplay: a\nstudent who acts (for example by arguing that a particular task should be done as the\nnext step) changes not only himself (by taking a stand) but also the team (for example,\nby making the team focus on something new). The relationship between the student\nand the team (of which he\/she is a part) also changes with his\/her argument: he\/she\nmight, for example, get a more central position as a result of the discussion. The\ncomplex environment that the students face in this project, where the complete team\nnever meet face to face, brings these matters to a head.\nThe on-going project has explored these issues from a phenomenographic perspec-\ntive, and has revealed two factors that together play an important role in shaping a\nstudent\u2019s experience of being a team member. These are (1) the experience of the parts,\nof which the team is constituted, and (2) the relationships between these parts, expe-\nrienced as a control structure within a team. While the first describes the structure of\nthe team that a student experiences, and addresses the issue of the parts or units that\nconstitute the team, the latter highlights the capacity to take and implement decisions\nwithin a team. Here a complex picture evolves that expresses itself in issues such as\nthe roles of the leader and the team members, as well as in their relationships. Aspects\nconcerning the organisation (or lack of organisation) of a team also become visible.\nFour qualitatively different ways of experiencing the control structure were\ndiscerned, described elsewhere in greater detail (Berglund, in press): \n1. Control is distributed. Here individuals are active participants in the control\nstructure. Decisions are jointly taken, with the role of the team leader being to\ncoordinate and facilitate communication.\n2. Control is allocated. The capacity to take decisions lies with the team members but\nis allocated to a team leader. The team leader distributes tasks to the participants\nand offers support in a working two-way communication with the team members.\n 74\n \nA. Berglund\n                 3. Control is taken by a few. A sub-team (or an individual) takes control of the activi-\nties in the team, where they (or he\/she) enforce the decisions. Control is unevenly\ndistributed, with one-way communication taking place from the centre of control\nto more peripheral team members.\n4. Control is missing. In the absence of a defined, stable structure, different ad hoc sub-\ngroups try to gain control in an ongoing social game. The situation of an individual\nteam member varies with the changes in the control structure.\nThe first two categories will be further discussed and contrasted in this case study.\nThe analysis here aims to illuminate and explore the phenomenographic results and\nis performed according to the framework presented in the previous sections. This\nexample will demonstrate how, through the use of concepts of activity theory, deeper\ninsights are gained into the phenomenographic findings.\nThe first category depicts a situation where control is shared. The forms for the\ncommunication in the team are negotiated (communication sub-triangle, lower left\ncorner in Figure 3), which is constituted by a subject (a team member), the community\n(the full team of six) and the rules, norms and traditions that evolve in the discussion\nor that are brought into the situation. Here, the relationship between an individual\nand the team crystallises. At the same time, and as a part of the same process, a struc-\nture for how decisions are taken is created. The sub-triangle in the lower right corner\nof the same figure (here labelled coordination) depicts how the object (the software\npackage that the team work upon) is distributed over and coordinated between the\nteam members in an on-going process. Finally, the development (or consumption)\ntriangle characterizes the subject\u2019s striving to transform the object, an effort that takes\nplace within and with the assistance of the community.\nRelating the category Control is distributed of the experienced control structure to an activityA particular feature of this category is indicated in the strong position that is held\nby the team, both in the creation of rules and in the distribution of control and labour.\nThe value of an open communication that offers possibilities to renegotiate the rules\nhas been reported during the interviews. The control of the object is experienced as\njointly shared, orchestrated by a team leader with a coordinating function. This\nimplies that the subject experiences himself to be a part of the control structure, as\nillustrated by arrow a in Figure 3. The picture of the experience of the control struc-\nture, as drawn here, suggests both through the absence of visible conflicts and by its\ncapacity to cope with changes that the category under investigation is harmonious and\nfunctional.\nA similar picture can be discerned for the second phenomenographic category, but\nof course, there are differences, as illustrated in Figure 4. The most significant\ndiscrepancies, compared with the previously discussed category, lie in the different\nmeanings of the components of the activity system. Differences are found both in the\nrole of the subject (which here offers parts of his\/her capabilities to a selected team\nleader) and the team (which here, as a unit, becomes less involved in the on-going\ncontrol). Arrow a in Figure 3 becomes less important and would now describe the\nexperience of two-way communication, instead of experienced participation. For this\nreason it is omitted in Figure 4. To further emphasize the changes, the triangle to the\nright is re-labelled to distribution.\n A framework to study learning in a complex learning environment\n \n75\nFigure 3.

Berglund\n    The development of the experienced control structure over time for the phenomenographic category Control is allocated. The top sketch indicate the situation as experienced in the early phase of the group, the down left sketch depicts how the situation is experienced for a team member in a non-leading position, while the down right shows the situation as experienced by the leader.This category describes a change. Initially, as a new team is constituted, it selects a\nleader, to whom the right to take and implement decisions is allocated. The rules for\nthe collaboration as well as the division of control and labour are negotiated. At later\nstages, when the rules are set, the situation develops so that the leader comes to act\non behalf on his\/her team taking decisions and distributing tasks. The roles of\nmembers in non-leading positions also develop to become dominated by the rules.\nThe sketches in Figure 4 represent this change. After the initial phase (upper trian-\ngle), the leader experiences a situation where distribution and development form the\ncore, as illustrated in the lower left sketch. For a team member in a non-leading func-\ntion communication and development dominate in their experience of the situation\ninstead (lower right sketch).\nIn general, this category represents a control structure that functions well. Prob-\nlems are only rarely reported by team members who do not have a leadership position.\nOne of the team leaders, has, on the other hand, vented their frustration, expressed\nin a conflict between his duties as a team leader to distribute tasks and the absence of\nmeaningful ways to enforce his leadership.\nSome aspects of the activity theoretical framework can shed further light on the\nproblem he expresses. When the team is working with the code, after the initial deci-\nsions the rules about how the work should be performed are applied. If a problem\narises, it cannot easily be solved through a redefinition of rules in the on-going process,\nsince rule-constructing activities have now ceased (as illustrated in the lower right\ntriangle) and the leader no longer has the capacity to influence the rules. The process\nof redefinition, discussed above as an aspect of the first phenomenographic category,\nis not directly available at later stages. To overcome this contradiction, a developmen-\ntal change of the system itself is needed (Engestr\u00f6m, 1987), that is, new decisions\nabout the control structure need to be taken within the team. Comparing this with\nthe first category, in which rules can continuously be renegotiated, a critical difference\nbetween the two categories has thus been discerned. These results are well in line with\nthe findings of Hause (2003), who from a study drawing its data from the interaction\nbetween the team members in the same course, through the application of discourse\nanalysis, has shown that decentralized groups show high quality outcomes.\nDiscussion: what can be learned from the case study?\nThis case study illustrates how the framework can be deployed to enlighten findings\nfrom a phenomenographic analysis through the use of elements from activity theory.\nThe development over time, and the possible conflicts that lie hidden in the differ-\nent ways that something (here the control structure) is experienced, are brought to\nlight. In this example, a contradiction hidden within one of the phenomenographic\ncategories has become visible, and a control structure where the control is distrib-\nuted has been identified as more desirable than one where the control is allocated to\nthe team leader.\nIn this context, it must be remembered that the categories are idealised descriptions\nthat are created by the researcher. This implies that the categories do not correspond\n A framework to study learning in a complex learning environment\n \n77\n      to specific \u2018real\u2019 teams. Instead, they serve as patterns that help the researcher in his\/\nher task of analysing the learning situation. Thus one cannot draw the conclusion that\na team, which by participants is described as having a distributed control structure, is\nautomatically a well-functioning team. Turning the statement around is possible,\nhowever: a distributed control structure is one (of the) desirable control structure(s)\nand thus ought to be encouraged through course design.\nOf course, the case study presented here does not represent a complete activity and\ndoes not give justice to the complexity and richness of activity theory. The final anal-\nyses of this project will encompass not only one issue, such as control, but also other\nphenomena studied in the phenomenographic tradition. The activity will then be\ntaken as a whole and will describe a system where the activity models the students\u2019\nexperience of their learning situation. However, already a small example of this kind,\nwhere only some ways of experiencing one phenomenon have been scrutinised,\nillustrates how the framework can serve as a vehicle for the researcher to learn about\nthe students\u2019 experiences and thus can inform course design.\nConclusions\nThe framework proposed in this paper is intended to allow the study of learning\nconcepts within a subject area in a complex learning environment. It offers ways of\nanalysing and interpreting the learning that takes place in distributed project-based\ncourses, and enables identification of critical factors in the learning environment that\npromote\u2014or hinder\u2014learning. The framework is based upon phenomenography,\nextend by concepts from activity theory. In this way the perspective of the learner, and\nthe importance of the subject area (both key features of phenomenography) are kept\nbut the scope is enriched from focusing mainly on the variation in experience of\nparticular phenomena to encompassing the whole learning environment in the differ-\nent ways that learners experience it. As experienced contradictions and conflicts\nbecome visible for the researcher, insights into how students go about collaborating\nare gained, and the different elements in the course environment can be related to\ncollaboration and learning.\nThrough use of the framework, an analysis of the variation in the experience of a\nlearning environment as a whole is enabled. In this respect it offers richer results for\nstudies concerning the learning environment than phenomenography alone, in which\nissues contextual to the phenomenon under investigation are relegated to the back-\nground. Since students experience their learning environment as a whole\u2014and not as\na set of phenomena\u2014this feature of the framework is valuable for the study of\ncomplex learning environments.\nIn contrast to studies performed in the activity theoretical tradition per se, the\nstudents\u2019 experience is the keystone of the proposed framework. To take the students\u2019\nways of experiencing the learning environment into account offers ways of designing\nwell-functioning courses. Changes in course design must be based on the learners\u2019\nexperiences if they are not to be counter-productive to the learning aims. This aspect\nis highlighted through an example in the article, where one way of experiencing the\n 78\n \nA. Berglund\n                                 structure of control in a virtual team is recognised to be more fruitful than another,\nwith regard to how well the group functions as a unit. Course designers should\nconsider such issues if they are to develop courses that promote desirable structures\nof collaboration within teams.\nThrough its focus on the students\u2019 ways of experiencing learning in an experienced\nwhole, the framework contributes to research and development in computer-\nsupported distributed project-based courses that promote students\u2019 learning of the\nsubject area.\nAcknowledgements\nThis paper is based on a research paper presented at ALT-C 2003 and published in\nthe conference\u2019s research proceedings.\nThis project is financed by The Knowledge Foundation of Sweden and the\nSwedish Research Council.
