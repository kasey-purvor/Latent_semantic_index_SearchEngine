One important strategic function of terrorism is to weaken the govern-\nment \u2013 either directly by attacking representatives or supporters of the govern-\nment or indirectly by causing a political response, which is unpopular among \nthe population. Often, however, political stability of the home government is \nbuttressed by foreign powers. In this case, the terrorists can have a strategic \ninterest in attacking nationals of these foreign countries. This paper analyzes \nthis logic by looking at international alliances as a proxy for international \nsupport. If the friend of my enemy is my enemy, then terror entrepreneurs, \nwhich seek to overthrow their home country\u2019s government (the enemy), may \nfind it attractive to target nationals of the foreign allies of their country (the \nfriends of the enemy). Our theory predicts that attacking nationals of a foreign \nally is particularly attractive if this ally is militarily more powerful than the \nhome country. Moreover, the combined effect of alliance and relative power \ndifferentials becomes stronger the more democratic the ally and becomes weaker \nthe more democratic the terrorists\u2019 home country. We find empirical support for \nour hypotheses in an analysis of a directed country dyad sample of international \nterrorism. \n2 \n1.  Introduction \nWhy do terrorists from one country target nationals of another country? The \nfast growing literature on terrorism, which has focused on the root causes of \nterrorism (Abadie 2006), is surprisingly ill-equipped to answer this question. On \na theoretical level, research has neglected the impact of links between the \nterrorists\u2019 home country and the victims\u2019 country on patterns of international \nterrorism. This has translated, on the empirical side, into studies that aggregate \nacts of terror at the country level (of the terrorists or the victims or the location \nof terror). These studies have generated insightful results. Yet, by design they \nare not capable of analyzing why terrorists from one country target nationals \nfrom some foreign countries, but not from others.1 \nStarting from the assumption that terror groups want to gain a \nsignificant political influence on their country of origin or the broader region \n(Crenshaw 1981, 2001; Pape 2003, 2005; Kydd and Walter 2006), terror groups \nshould mainly attack domestic targets. However, some governments borrow \nstrength from more powerful allied foreign powers. Citizens from countries that \nstabilize the government in the terrorists\u2019 home country may then become a \nderivative, strategic target of terror attacks. If the friend of my enemy is my \nenemy, then terrorist groups, which seek to overthrow their country\u2019s \ngovernment (the \u201cenemy\u201d), will find it attractive to target nationals of the \nforeign supporters of their country (the \u201cfriends of the enemy\u201d).  \n                                     \n1  The only directed country dyad studies of terrorism we are aware of are Krueger \nand Laitin (2008) and Blomberg and Rosendorff (2006).  \n3 \nIn this paper, we study one important way in which foreign support \nrenders the nationals of the supporting country more vulnerable to becoming \nthe victims of terrorism: international alliances. We argue that the incentive to \ninflict terror on nationals from the foreign ally becomes stronger if allies are \nmilitarily more capable than the home country. This interaction effect between \nalliance and relative difference in military capability is itself conditioned by the \ntype of political regime in both of the allied countries. Specifically, the joint \neffect of alliance membership and power asymmetry becomes stronger the more \ndemocratic the foreign ally and the more autocratic the home country. \nWe test the hypotheses derived from our theory on pooled data from a \ndirected country dyad sample, covering the period between 1968 and 2003. As \npredicted by our theory, the global patterns of international terrorism vary with \nco-membership in international alliances, where groups from the weaker ally are \nmore likely to attack citizens from the stronger ally than vice versa. We also \nfind that this joint effect of alliances and power asymmetries is amplified by an \nautocratic government in the terrorists\u2019 home country and a democratic \ngovernment in the ally.  \n2. The Strategic Logic of Attacking Foreign Allies \nThis section develops a theory of the strategic logic of terrorism, international \nalliances, power asymmetries and democracy. We argue that attacking the ally \nof the home country\u2019s government rather than the government itself can be an \nattractive and at times optimal strategy for terrorist groups. Our theory \ndistinguishes three main actors: the terrorist group (called the terrorists), the \ngovernment of the terrorists\u2019 home country, which the group wants to fight and \n4 \nultimately overthrow (called the home government), and the government of the \nforeign ally of this home government (called the ally). \n2.1  The Strategic Logic of Terrorism \nOur theory starts from the premise that terrorist organizations strive for \npolitical power and control (Kydd and Walter 2006; Neumayer and Pl\u00fcmper \n2009a, 2009b), either in a single country or, as is the case with al-Qaeda and \nother transnational terror networks (Asal et al. 2007), in several countries of a \nparticular region or civilization.2 Terrorism is an instrument for groups that \ncannot obtain this goal in a legal way \u2013 either because their country of interest \nis not a democracy or because they are too weak and unpopular to gain sub-\nstantial votes, let alone get hold of government by winning elections (Enders \nand Sandler 2006).  \nTerrorist groups differ in size, resources, the degree of violence they \naccept, and \u2013 perhaps most importantly \u2013 their ideology. Rapoport (2003) and \nShughart (2006) distinguish three overlapping \u201cwaves of modern terrorism\u201d in \nthe 20th century: Anti-colonial and ethno-nationalist terrorism, particularly \ndominant in the 1950s and 1960s, aimed at political independence from the \ncolonial occupiers or secession for their ethnic kin. Radical left terrorists \ntriggered a wave that swept over many developed and developing countries in \nthe 1970s and 1980s. More recently, international terrorism became dominated \nby Islamic terror groups seeking to replace moderate governments in countries \n                                     \n2  This assumption may not hold true for every single terror group, but the vast \nmajority of them have political objectives. \n5 \nwith a predominantly Islamic population by a more radical version of Islamic \nrule. Importantly, stark ideological differences notwithstanding all terror groups \naim at gaining political power and control in a country. \nHowever, terrorism is poorly understood if one focuses exclusively on the \nlong-term goals of the terrorist groups and ignores the strategic logic of \nterrorism. Since most terrorists are unable to reach their ultimate goals in the \nshort-run, they need to focus first and foremost on two fundamental \nintermediate goals. On the one hand, they need to keep the group alive. On the \nother hand, the terror entrepreneurs need to gain power relative to the \ngovernment they seek to overthrow. For terror entrepreneurs, a terror plot is \nbeneficial if it increases the support of the terrorists amongst their peers and re-\nduces the government\u2019s strength. Attacks often provide terror entrepreneurs \nwith media attention, and thus with the opportunity to promote their pro-\npaganda and recruit new terror agents. \nAt the same time, if the terror entrepreneurs intend to weaken the \ngovernment, the attack either needs to affect the government directly (e.g., by \nkilling an important representative) or it must cause a political response, which \nis unpopular among the population and thus weakens the government indirectly. \nAs Kydd and Walter (2006) argue, provoking a harsh anti-terror response can \nbe perfectly rational for terrorists. Since terror attacks create a widespread \nnotion of insecurity, the government is likely to invest more heavily in security \npolicies. As a consequence, individual freedoms will be restricted and taxes or \nbudget deficits will rise. Accordingly, the support for the government may \ndecline even if the country\u2019s population does not back the terrorists. Moreover, \n6 \na harsh security response by the government aggravates grievances among the \nterror group\u2019s actual and potential supporters, which drives out more moderate \nvoices and helps recruiting terror agents (Crenshaw 1981; Rosendorff and \nSandler 2004). The terror entrepreneurs need to balance these strategic benefits \nfrom terrorism against the costs imposed on them by the governmental \ncrackdown on terrorism.3 \n2.2  Foreign Alliances and Power Asymmetry \nSince terror entrepreneurs seek to gain political influence and control in their \nown countries, their targeting of foreign nationals is not self-explanatory. Terror \nentrepreneurs from the home country are typically not interested in gaining po-\nlitical power and control in the allied country. In other words, attacking the ally \nis not the ultimate goal of the terrorists. However, attacking the ally can offer \nimportant advantages in achieving the terrorists\u2019 intermediate strategic goals. \nSome governments only survive with the support of their foreign allies. In \nother words, it is sometimes not the military strength of the home government \nitself that provides the largest obstacle for the terrorists\u2019 bid for political power \nand control, but the military strength of the ally. The ally may, for example, \nstation troops in the home country, it can provide military aid, arms, military \ntraining, political and economic support, and so on. The larger the power \nasymmetry between the foreign ally and the home country, the more dependent \n                                     \n3  See Rosendorff and Sandler (2004), Bueno de Mesquita (2007), Bueno de \nMesquita and Dickson (2007) and Powell (2007) for a formal modeling of \ngovernmental counter-terrorism. \n7 \nthe home government is on the military power of the ally and the more \nimportant therefore the ally becomes as an obstacle to the terrorists. The power \nasymmetry is starkest when the home government can only survive with the \nhelp of foreign troops stationed in the country (Pape 2005). In targeting the \nforeign ally, the terrorists hope to cause the ally\u2019s withdrawal and retreat from \ninterfering in the affairs of the home country, thus weakening the government \nand increasing the terrorists\u2019 chances of success. \nAllies can also become an attractive target of the terror group because for \nvarious reasons attacks on nationals of the ally may be more popular among the \nterrorists\u2019 peers and potential supporters. First, the presence of foreigners from \nthe ally may be perceived as illegitimate: Foreign troops are seen as occupiers \nrather than allies, foreign businessmen as exploiters rather than as employers or \nbusiness partners and foreign tourists as the thieves of cultural heritage rather \nthan as a business opportunity. Again, this effect is likely to be strengthened by \na large power asymmetry between the ally and the home country, as this creates \nwidespread feelings of inferiority and humiliation among the native people. \nAlong similar lines, nationals of the ally are often a more attractive \ntarget because media attention increases when foreigners die in the attack. As \nwe have already argued, media attention enables the terrorists to spread their \npropaganda more easily. More powerful countries will have more media corpora-\ntions and will enjoy greater global media coverage, such that a larger power \nasymmetry between the ally and the home country again makes targeting the \nforeign ally more attractive to the terrorists. \n8 \n2.3  The Conditioning Effect of Regime Type \nSome scholars of terrorism have argued that democracies are more prone to \nsuffer from terrorist attacks than autocratic regimes. Li (2005) and Enders and \nSandler (2006), for example, state that civil rights and liberal homeland security \npolicies make democracies more vulnerable and reduce the costs for terrorists. \nDemocratic regimes should also be more responsive to the terrorists\u2019 demands, if \nonly indirectly by being more responsive to the demands of a public terrified by \nthe terrorist attacks, thus raising the expected benefits of terrorism (Kydd and \nWalter 2006: 62 and 80). The insecurity and fear generated by terror campaigns \nputs public pressure on democratically elected governments to either defeat the \nterrorists or, as this is often impossible, to provide some concessions to their \npolitical demands. Suicide terrorism is particularly capable of inflicting harm \nand death on virtually any target, civilian or not, and it is not surprising that, \nas Pape (2003: 344) notes, \u2018every suicide terrorist campaign since 1980 has been \ntargeted against a state that had a democratic form of government\u2019. About half \nof these campaigns resulted in major political concessions by the targeted \ndemocracies (Pape 2005). Finally, the greater press freedom in democracies \nensures that the terrorists have a higher chance to propagate their ideology, \nwhen the attack is directed against targets in or from democratic countries. \nYet, a systemic perspective makes one important contribution to the ana-\nlysis of democracy and terrorism: Terrorist attacks on nationals from Norway \nand Sweden are extremely rare, while attacks on American or British nationals \nare much more frequent despite all these countries sharing similar degrees of \nliberal democracy and press freedom. This empirical observation suggests that \n9 \ncivic freedoms do not \u2018cause\u2019 terrorism per se. Terror entrepreneurs are not just \ninterested in targeting innocent citizens from democracies, but in the strategic \nvalue of targets. Citizens from some democracies offer far greater strategic \nbenefits than citizens from other democracies. Analyzing democracy from this \nperspective renders the argument straightforward: a higher degree of democracy \nin the ally raises the likelihood of terrorists targeting citizens from the ally for \nany given level of power asymmetry between the government and the ally. It \nlowers the opportunity costs and increases the expected payoff to terror entre-\npreneurs of inflicting terror on nationals of the ally. This is because the more \ndemocratic the political regime in the ally country, the more pressure the ally \ngovernment will experience from its public to withdraw support to the \ngovernment from the terrorists\u2019 home country in order to escape further terror \nattacks. Gartzke and Gleditsch (2004) argue that democracies are less reliable \nallies than autocracies due to fickle public opinion and transient coalitions. \nExactly for this reason, terror entrepreneurs can expect to gain more from tar-\ngeting a democratic foreign ally than an autocratic one.  \nAlong similar lines, regime type in the terrorists\u2019 home country will \ncondition strategic reasons of terrorism as well. It can be argued that democracy \ncan also have a pacifying effect as it raises the opportunity costs to terrorists by \noffering alternative, non-violent, means of conflict resolution (Schmid 1992; Li \n2005), thus reducing terrorism. In democracies, individuals can form interest \ngroups and parties to promote their political preferences and actively participate \nin political competition. Democracies are also likely to inflict fewer grievances \non the terrorists\u2019 potential supporters exactly because they respect more civil \n10 \nliberties and political rights, thus rendering it more difficult for terror \nentrepreneurs to recruit terror agents (Crenshaw 1981). \nYet, again, once we consider the systemic perspective toward \ninternational terrorism, the link between democracy in the home country and \nterrorism on targets from the foreign ally becomes straightforward. A higher \nlevel of democracy in the terrorists\u2019 home country may or may not discourage \nall forms of terrorism in this country. However, once we control for the direct \nimpact of democracy in the home country, its conditioning effect on the joint \neffect of alliance and power asymmetry on terrorism against the foreign ally is \nunambiguously negative. Ceteris paribus, the more democratic the home \ncountry, the less it pays the terrorists to target nationals of the foreign ally \nrather than nationals of the home country. In targeting their own nationals, the \nterror leaders hope that the domestic public will put pressure on the home gov-\nernment to accommodate some of the terrorists\u2019 demands and since democracies \nare more responsive to public demand, terror entrepreneurs expect a higher \nbenefit from targeting nationals from the democratic home country rather than \nnationals from the ally. This holds true as long as one is willing to assume that \nthe domestic public is less tolerant of harm inflicted on its own nationals than it \nis of harm inflicted on nationals from the foreign ally, which we think is highly \nplausible. \n2.4  Hypotheses \nWhile the micro-level of our theory has terror entrepreneurs and their agents as \nactors, it does not make predictions at the terror group level but rather at the \ndyadic country level: Terrorism against foreigners of a specific nationality \n11 \nincrease if the terror groups\u2019 country of origin has an alliance with a more \npowerful and more democratic foreign power. Accordingly, we derive from our \ntheory hypotheses for the dyadic country macro-level and we will estimate our \nempirical model at this level. In sum, our theory allows us to derive two testable \nhypotheses: First, an alliance between a foreign country and the home country \nincreases terrorism against nationals of the foreign ally the more the larger the \nmilitary capability of the foreign ally relative to the capability of the terrorists\u2019 \nhome country. Second, the joint effect of alliance and military power asymmetry \non terrorism against nationals of the foreign ally is stronger the more \ndemocratic the political regime in the ally and is weaker the more democratic \nthe political regime in the home country.  \n3. Research Design \nMost empirical studies of terrorism use a non-dyadic research design and \naggregate either all terror acts perpetrated on a country\u2019s territory or all terror \nacts perpetrated by or suffered by a country\u2019s nationals. To test our hypotheses \nwe need a directed country dyad design instead. \n3.1. Data and Operationalization \nTerrorism is notoriously difficult to measure because clear-cut definitions that \nallow distinguishing terrorism from guerrilla warfare on the one hand (Sambanis \n2008) and terrorism from ordinary crime on the other hand do not exist. We \nrely upon the most widely used dataset of international terrorism \u2013 the \n\u201cInternational Terrorism: Attributes of Terrorist Events\u201d (Iterate) data \n(Mickolus et al. 2003). According to Iterate, terrorism is \u201cthe use, or threat of \n12 \nuse, of anxiety-inducing, extra-normal violence for political purposes by any \nindividual or group, whether acting for or in opposition to established \ngovernmental authority, when such action is intended to influence the attitudes \nand behavior of a target group wider than the immediate victims\u201d (ibid.: 2). \nAccordingly, ordinary crime as well as violence for purposes other than political \nare explicitly excluded. Violence committed during international and civil wars \nis not coded as terrorism either. Thus, guerrilla attacks by rebel groups are not \ncounted, unless they are targeted against civilians or the dependents of military \npersonnel (Mickolus, Sandler and Murdock 1989: xii).  \nImportantly, the data set also excludes all terrorist acts, which are purely \ndomestic. To qualify as international, a terrorist act must \u201cthrough the \nnationality or foreign ties of its perpetrators, its location, the nature of its \ninstitutional or human victims, or the mechanics of its resolution, its \nramifications transcend national boundaries\u201d (Mickolus et al. 2003: 2). For our \nresearch, the limited comprehensiveness of the Iterate data set is unproblematic: \nour theory predicts an absolute increase in terrorist attacks on citizens from \nmore powerful allied countries. True, it may well be that an increase in \ninternational terrorism reduces domestic terrorism (especially if extremist \ngroups face binding resource constraints), but it may also be the case that \nchanges in domestic terrorist activities are uncorrelated or even positively \ncorrelated with changes in international terrorist activities. Whichever is the \ncase, this issue is of negligible importance here as our theory predicts an \nabsolute increase in international terrorist activities as the relative military \ncapability of the foreign ally increases.  \n13 \nBeyond this limit, Iterate provides a wealth of information on each terror \nincident. We use two pieces of information that allow us to create a directed \ncountry dyadic dependent variable: first, the nationality of the terrorists (the \nfirst nationality of terrorists in case more than one nationality is involved); and \nsecond, the nationality of the victims (again, the first nationality of victims in \ncase nationals from several countries become victimized). We employ the annual \nsum of all terrorist incidents as our dependent variable, but our results are \nrobust to counting only fatal incidents, i.e. incidents that led to the killing of \none or more victims, as an alternative measure instead. The location of the \nterror incident as such does not matter. Thus, terrorists from country i might \ninflict terror on nationals from country j either in their home country i, or in \ncountry j or in some third country k. In all cases, terrorism is counted toward \nthe directed dyad between i and j. \nTo avoid multiple counting, only the first nationality of the terrorists and \nthe victims determines the origin and the target country of a terrorist act in the \nresults reported below. This has the disadvantage that information on the \nsecond and third primary nationality of terrorists and victims, also coded in \nIterate, is lost, but the vast majority of terrorist acts only involve one \nnationality of both terrorists and victims. Our results are robust to attributing \nterrorist acts to all the first three main nationalities of terrorists and victims \nsimultaneously. \nWe have to deal with the additional complication that there are incidents \nin the Iterate dataset where the main nationality of the terrorists and the \nvictims are the same. These cases do not necessarily constitute purely domestic \n14 \nterrorism since some aspect of the incident other than the foreign nationality of \nthe terrorists or victims, such as the incident\u2019s resolution for example, \ntranscends national boundaries to qualify for its inclusion in the dataset. Ho-\nwever, these are cases in which the distinction between international and do-\nmestic terrorism is often blurred. In other words, the Iterate data are noisy and \nthere is inevitably some measurement error in what counts as international and \ndomestic terrorism. Rather than eliminating these cases, we control for the \nmeasurement error they introduce by including a dummy variable for identical \ndyads (i.e., where the main nationality of the terrorists and the victims are the \nsame). Our results remain robust if we do not include this dummy variable. The \nsame is true for excluding the identical dyads from the sample. While these ob-\nservations are therefore potentially problematic in principle, they do not affect \nour estimates much in practice. \nClearly, our operationalization decisions may introduce some measure-\nment error into the data. For example, terror attacks do not always hit the \nintended victims. If, coincidentally, individuals of nations other than the \ntargeted one become the major victims this means that our dependent variable \nis measured with error. Similarly, if transnational terror networks such as al-\nQaeda draw from an international pool of terror agents (e.g., employing \nYemenite agents in attacks on Americans in Saudi Arabia), then this similarly \nleads to measurement error. Since, however, it is difficult to see why this \nmeasurement error should be systematically correlated with the explanatory \nvariables, we do not expect bias from the way we compute the dependent \nvariable. The same holds true for the information that we lose. For example, we \n15 \ndo not consider the very few cases, for which Iterate does not provide \ninformation on the primary nationality of terrorists or victims. Again, there is \nno reason to assume that Iterate systematically under- or over-reports the \nnationality of terrorists when the victims are citizens of an allied country. We \nalso decided to exclude terror acts involving Israeli terrorists or Israeli victims. \nThis is because the Arab-Israel conflict is unique. However, our results are \nrobust to including these terror acts in the estimations. \n3.2. Explanatory Variables \nOur main explanatory variables are alliance, military power and regime type. \nWe use two data sources for coding alliances. One is the Correlates of War \n(COW) Formal Interstate Alliance Data Set (Gibler and Sarkees 2004). This is \nperhaps better known than the second source, the Alliance Treaty Obligations \nand Provisions (ATOP) project (Leeds 2005; Sprecher and Krause 2006). \nHowever, whereas COW provides data only up to 2000, ATOP alliance data are \navailable to 2003. We measure alliance with a dummy variable that indicates \nwhether two countries had entered into a formal alliance in the form of a \ndefence pact with each other.4 During the overlapping period, the two dummy \n                                     \n4  ATOP differentiates in more detail among alliance types. For example, contrary \nto COW it also codes offense pacts. However, all alliances that include offense \npacts also include defense pacts, so this makes no difference to our coding. Our \nresults are robust toward additionally including non-aggression pacts (COW) or \nneutrality and non-aggression pacts (ATOP) as a weaker form of alliance between \ncountries. So-called ententes (COW) or consultation pacts (ATOP) pledge \n16 \nvariables derived from each of our sources are very highly correlated with each \nother at r = .93. About 6.2 (COW) to 6.7 (ATOP) percent of dyad years in our \nsample are between allied countries. \nIn accordance with the conflict literature we measure military power by \nthe widely used Composite Index of National Capacity (CINC) score, also taken \nfrom the Correlates of War project and pioneered by Singer, Bremer and Stukey \n(1972). A country\u2019s CINC score is a composite measure of its total population, \nurban population, iron and steel production, energy consumption, military \npersonnel, and military expenditure. To measure the power differential between \ntwo countries, we divide the CINC score of the foreign country by the sum of \nCINC scores of the home and the foreign country. A higher value of this \nvariable signifies increasing relative power of the foreign country relative to the \nhome country and a value above 0.5 means that the foreign country is the more \npowerful of the two. Democracy is measured by the Polity project\u2019s polity2 \nvariable (Marshall, Jaggers and Gurr 2006), which runs from \u201310 to 10. \nAs additional variables, we include the log of per capita income, the level \nof democracy and the logged population size of both the terrorists\u2019 origin \ncountry and the victims\u2019 country. This follows arguments provided by Krueger \nand Laitin (2008) and Abadie (2006) on welfare and terrorism as well as the \nliterature on democracy and terrorism discussed above. We also control for the \npopulation size of both countries to account for the simple fact that ceteris \nparibus more populous countries will generate more terrorism and suffer more \n                                                                                                            \nnothing more than consultation and\/or cooperation in crisis and are therefore \nexcluded from the definition of alliance used here. \n17 \nfrom terrorism. Data on income and population are taken from World Bank \n(2005). Lastly, we account for the fact that contiguity of two countries as well \nas geographical proximity lowers the costs for terrorists to execute terror acts \nagainst foreign nationals on the territory of the foreign country. The natural log \nof the distance between the capital cities of two countries and a dummy \nvariable for contiguity by land or separation by sea of less than 150 miles are \ntaken from Bennett and Stam (2005).5 In a further robustness test, we included \na variable measuring the number of nationals from the target country living in \nthe terrorist country to capture the pool of available potential victims within \neasy reach, with data taken from Parsons et al. (2007). This variable is not well \nsuited for panel as opposed to cross-sectional data. However, if included in the \nestimations it has the expected positive sign, leaving our main results \nunaffected. \n3.3. Estimation Method and Models \nOur dependent variable is a count variable (number of terrorist incidents). The \nnegative binomial is more reliable than the Poisson model, because our sample \nvariance of the number of incidents exceeds its sample mean by factor 32. We \ntherefore estimate negative binomial models with standard errors adjusted for \nclustering on country dyads, though the variation in incidents over time is large \n                                     \n5  For lack of data, we cannot control for the amount and quality (Bueno de \nMesquita 2007) of governmental counter-terrorist measures. However, insofar as \nthese measures are correlated with per capita income, we control for them \nindirectly. \n18 \nand clustering is of minor importance. We do not include year-specific time \ndummies, but our results are fully robust toward their inclusion. Our sample \ncovers the period 1968 to 2003 and up to 150 countries. Due to missing data on \nthe explanatory variables not all possible country dyads are included over the \nentire period. Approximately 0.5 percent of the dyads in our sample show \nterrorist activity. In robustness tests, we also estimate a so-called hurdle \nregression model to account for the dominance of values of zero in the sample. \n4. Results \nIn this section, we test our hypotheses. Before we present results from the re-\ngression analysis, we discuss two country cases and report some descriptive \nsummary statistics to illustrate our theory.6 \n4.1  Illustrative evidence \nThe Philippines is a fairly dangerous country for foreigners. During the period \n1968 to 2000, Philippine terrorists committed 173 terror incidents involving \nforeigners. This puts the country into the top decile of countries from which \ninternational terrorism emanates. Of these acts of terrorism, 111 involved \nnationals of the US, which is allied to the Philippines. This represents a large \nshare, even if taking into account that US citizens are major victims of \ninternational terrorism globally. While the Philippines may illustrate how being \nallied to a foreign country can expose nationals of the foreign ally to an \n                                     \n6  These refer to using the COW data for alliances, but are very similar if ATOP \ndata are used instead. \n19 \nenhanced risk of terrorism, it is also a somewhat unusual case because the US is \nits only foreign ally. If we want to get a sense of how power differentials \nbetween allies affect international terrorism, then clearly we need to look for a \ndifferent case. \nColombia is a good candidate for illustrating our argument that there is \nnot only an effect of international alliances on terrorism, but also that this effect \nis conditional on power differentials between the terrorists\u2019 home country and \nthe country of the victims. Colombia has both allies that are more powerful and \nallies that are less powerful than herself. Colombian terrorists have been respon-\nsible for a large number of terrorist incidents (371) involving foreigners. 293 of \nthese acts of terror involved nationals from allied countries (a share of 79 per-\ncent). Of the 85 country dyad years, in which Colombian terrorists targeted \nnationals from foreign allies, only 34 involved nationals from countries with a \nlower military capability than Colombia\u2019s. This is quite striking because in \nabout 81 percent of country dyad years, Colombia is actually the more powerful \ncountry of the two allies. The United States alone, being just one out of many \nallies, but by far its militarily most capable one, accounts for 26 of the 85 \ncountry dyad years. \nOur argument that the interaction effect between foreign alliance and \npower differentials is itself contingent on the level of democracy in both \ncountries is, due to its complexity, rather difficult to illustrate with a case \nexample. However, Colombia can again serve to shed some light on our \nargument. Colombia has been a democracy throughout the period of study, but \nits allies have not always been. The military power differential between \n20 \nColombia and its allies remains fairly stable over time, whereas the level of \ndemocracy shows modest change as some of its allies have experienced phases of \nautocratic regime. Out of the 713 country dyad years Colombia shares with \nforeign allies and for which we have data on the ally\u2019s level of democracy, 302 \nare with foreign autocracies.7 Interestingly, then, only 17 out of 293 terrorist \nincidents involved an autocratic foreign ally. \nGoing beyond two specific case countries, next we briefly report some \nsummary descriptive statistics that can further illustrate our argument. As \nmentioned already, about 6.2 percent of dyad years in our sample are made up \nof allied countries. Yet, 35.5 percent of incidents are associated with these dyad \nyears of allied countries. Of those terror attacks targeted at nationals from fo-\nreign allies, 85.8 percent of incidents involve nationals from foreign allies that \nare more powerful than the home country of the terrorists. Of these, 72 percent \nof incidents involve nationals from more powerful foreign allies that are also \nmore democratic than the home country of the terrorists. Figure 1 displays this \ninformation graphically. It demonstrates how acts of international terrorism are \nconcentrated on nationals from militarily more powerful allies and, particularly \nso, if these are more democratic than the terrorists\u2019 home country.  \n \n                                     \n7  We chose 6 as the cut-off point, such that a polity value of 5 represents the most \ndemocratic autocracies and a value of 6 the least democratic democracies. \n21 \n3092 incidents\n     64.8%\n  1682 incidents\n       35.2%\n4774 incidents\n1039 incidents\n      72.0%\n239 incidents\n     14.2%\n 404 incidents\n      28.0%\n1443 incidents\n      85.8%\nallied\n[6.2 %]\nnot allied\n  [93.8 %]\nally more powerful\n[50 %]\n ally less powerful\n                  [50 %]\nally more democratic\n[39.2 %]\nally less democratic\n                  [60.8 %]\n \n \nFigure 1: Terrorist incidents and international alliances, power differentials, and \nregime types \n \nBoth figure 1 and the two country cases support our theory. However, neither of \nthem controls for alternative explanations for international terrorism. Results, \nthus, may easily be spurious. \n4.2  Multivariate regression analysis \nAs we have argued above, the effect of alliances on terrorism against the foreign \nally\u2019s nationals is contingent on the relative military capabilities of the foreign \nally compared to the home country, and on the level of democracy in both \ncountries. We approach these double contingencies by estimating two model \ntypes: In models 1 and 3 we are solely interested in the joint effect of alliance \nmembership and power asymmetries. Models 2 and 4 interact this joint effect of \n22 \nalliances and power asymmetries further with the level of democracy in both \ncountries. The specification of these two models mirrors those used in Franzese \n(1999, 2003). In short, we first estimate the joint effect of alliances and power \nasymmetry. We then compute the vector of this joint effect and interact it with \ndemocracy in both the ally and the terrorists\u2019 home country.8 Models 1 and 2 on \nthe one hand and models 3 and 4 on the other differ only with respect to the \noperationalization of alliances.

As expected, both size and \ngeography matter for terrorism in dyads of countries. The population size of the \ntarget country has a slightly larger effect on terrorist activity than the popula-\ntion size of the terrorists\u2019 home country. Distance also matters. The number of \nterrorist incidents declines in geographical distance between the origin and the \npotential target country. Neighborhood effects as measured by contiguity, which \n24 \ntend to have a strong impact on militarized conflict between countries, are in-\nsignificant, however, once we control for distance. \nThe effect of per capita income in origin countries on terrorism remains \ncontroversial in the literature (see Krueger and Maleckov\u00e1 2003 for an insightful \nreview). Our results lend some support to those who do not believe that \nterrorism originates in poverty (Piazza 2006). One has to keep in mind, \nhowever, that our results report the effect of a country\u2019s average income on \ninternational terrorist activity. Any inferences back to the motivation of \nindividual terrorists necessarily suffer from environmental fallacy. \nOur findings provide little support for an unconditional effect of \ndemocracy in the target country on terrorist activities. This can be seen from \nthe statistically insignificant coefficients for this variable in models 1 and 3, in \nwhich democracy is not interacted with another variable. As concerns de-\nmocracy in the terrorists\u2019 home country, the unconditional effect on incidents is \nsignificant in models 1 and 3, suggesting that more democratic countries \nproduce fewer international terrorist attacks. \nTurning to our variables of main interest, the correct interpretation of \nthe results reported in table 1 is rendered very difficult by the non-linearity of \nthe negative binomial regression model. In a linear model, the hypothesis that \nthe effect of one independent variable on the dependent variable depends on \nanother explanatory variable can be easily tested by a t-test of the estimated \ncoefficient of the interaction term (Kam and Franzese 2007: 50). If this were a \nlinear model, then results from models 1 and 3 on the coefficient of the \ninteraction between alliance and relative military strength of the ally would \n25 \nindeed suggest that joint membership in an alliance exerts a statistically \nsignificantly stronger effect on the number of terrorist incidents the higher the \nrelative power differentials between the two countries, in accordance with our \nfirst hypothesis. Similarly, the results for the interacted variables from models 2 \nand 4 would suggest that the combined effect of alliance and power differentials \nbecomes significantly weaker the more democratic the terrorists\u2019 home country \nand significantly stronger the more democratic the target country, in line with \nour second hypothesis. \nUnfortunately, this easy way of testing the statistical significance of an \ninteraction effect no longer applies when the model is non-linear. As Ai and \nNorton (2003: 129) have shown, in nonlinear models \u201cthe interaction effect (\u2026) \ncannot be evaluated simply by looking at the sign, magnitude, or statistical \nsignificance of the coefficient of the interaction term.\u201d Instead, the \ninterpretation of the interaction term requires computing the cross derivative of \nthe expected value of the dependent variable, which depends on all the \ncovariates in the model and their values. Testing the significance of interaction \nterms in non-linear models is thus an extremely complex task and in Pl\u00fcmper \nand Neumayer (2008), the working paper version of this article, we explain in \ndetail how we have dealt with this problem. In brief, we find broad support for \nthe existence of a significant interaction effect unless the values of the control \nvariables render terrorism extremely unlikely. \n4.3.  Effect strengths \nWe now turn to evaluating the substantive effect of our main variables of \ninterest. Table 2 reports the predicted joint effects of alliance membership and \n26 \npower differential for a range of values of relative military strength of the target \ncountry, based on estimation results from model 1.9 The reported values are \npercentage changes in the predicted count of terrorist incidents relative to a \nchosen reference category in which both countries are equally powerful and \nshare no alliance with each other (controls are kept at their sample means). The \npresence of an alliance increases the predicted count strongly and the more so \nthe larger the power differential.  \n \nTable 2. Predicted Joint Effect of Power Difference and Alliance. \n \n  non allied dyad  allied dyad \n 0.1 -11.4  92.4 \nrelative military 0.3 -6.3  157.0 \nstrength of  0.5 0.0  241.8 \ntarget country 0.7 6.3  355.7 \n 0.9 13.9  507.6 \n \nNote: Percentage change in predicted count of terrorist \nincidents relative to base category (no alliance, relative military \nstrength 0.5, all control variables at mean values). Estimates \nbased on model 1.  \n \nBeing based on model 1, these predicted joint effects do not yet take into ac-\ncount the conditioning effect of democracy in the terrorists\u2019 home country and \nthe target country. Table 3 therefore shows the predicted joint effect of alliance \nmembership, power differential and democracy for a range of relevant values, \nbased on estimation results from model 2.10 Similar to table 4, we report these \n                                     \n9  Effects are substantively identical for model 3. \n10  Effects are substantively identical for model 4. \n27 \neffects as a percentage change relative to a chosen base category in which, as \nbefore, the two countries are not allied and are equally powerful and, in \naddition now, they are also equally democratic. All other variables are held at \ntheir sample mean.  \nLooking at the predicted joint effects for dyads that are not allied with \neach other, it becomes apparent that even a very large military power \ndifferential value of 0.9 together with the largest possible difference in demo-\ncracy score between the target and the terrorists\u2019 home country (20) increases \nthe expected count of terrorist attacks by only 29.6 percent relative to our base \ncategory. This contrasts starkly with the predicted joint effects for when the \ntwo dyads are allied with each other. If the two countries are equally powerful \nand equally democratic, the existence of an alliance raises the expected count \nalmost twofold relative to the base category in which both countries are also \nequally powerful and democratic, but not allied with each other. Our estimates \nsuggest that the effect of alliances ceteris paribus becomes much more \npronounced if the foreign ally is more powerful than the terrorists\u2019 home \ncountry. The same occurs if the ally\u2019s level of democracy drastically exceeds the \ndemocracy level of the terrorists\u2019 home country. On the other hand, if the \nterrorists\u2019 home country is very democratic whereas the foreign ally is very \nautocratic, then the effect of alliance on terror against citizens of the foreign ally \nbecomes small, even for large power differentials. We therefore conclude here \nthat not only do alliances, power asymmetries and the level of democracy in \nboth of the allied countries exert a statistically significant, but also a \n28 \nsubstantively large influence on the change in the expected number of terrorist \nattacks. \n \n29 \nTable 3.

Estimates based on model 2.  \n30 \n4.4  Robustness tests \nOur results are robust toward various modifications to the design of our \nempirical analysis. We have mentioned already that, for example, they are \nrobust toward counting more than one nationality of terrorists and victims \nsimultaneously, toward several ways of dealing with observations in which the \nterrorists and their victims share the same nationality and toward the exclusion \nor inclusion of Israel in the estimations.  \nIn addition, we analyzed the effects of excluding the somewhat special \ncase of anti-American terrorism from the sample. Americans are major victims \nof international terrorism (see Author 2007b). The US is also the militarily \nstrongest country in the world, with many international alliances and the \nhighest possible level of democracy on the Polity scale. Hence, one might be \nconcerned whether our results are driven by terror victims from a single \ncountry. We therefore re-ran models 2 and 4 on a sample that excludes the US \nas a target of terror to explore whether our estimation results hinge on this one \nspecial case. We find it does not. \nWe conducted another robustness test to address the fact that \ninternational terrorism is a relatively rare event and some dyad years are much \nmore likely to experience any such terrorism than others. To account for the \nfact that our dependent variable has a large number of zeros, we also estimated \nall models with what is known as a hurdle model. The hurdle model combines a \nbinary model to predict values of zero with another model to predict non-zero \n31 \nvalues.11 Its underlying assumption is that different mechanisms account for \nzeros than for the distribution of non-zeros. We doubt whether this estimation \nprocedure is consistent with the processes that generate international terrorism, \nbut we prefer hurdle models to the zero-inflated negative binomial alternative \nsince this latter model rests on even less tenable assumptions. It assumes that \nsome dyad years do not experience international terrorism with probability of \none (Long and Freese 2006: ch. 8) \u2013 which seems to be inconsistent with \nempirical evidence and for which there is no obvious theoretical justification \neither. In re-estimating models 2 and 4 with the hurdle model we found that all \nthe variables of interest to our theory affect the first binary part with \ncoefficients that are identical in coefficient sign to the coefficients we get in the \nnegative binomial estimations and are also statistically significant. With one \nexception, the same is true for the second part. \n5. Conclusion \nLike all international conflicts, patterns of terrorism are influenced by \ninternational relations between countries and their interaction with domestic \npolitical conditions. We have analyzed how the presence of an international \nalliance in combination with power differentials between the two countries \n                                     \n11  For the first part, we used a logit estimator and a geometric estimator for the \nsecond part as the negative binomial estimator failed to converge for this part. \nThe geometric regression is a special case of the negative binomial and well suited \nas a simpler alternative to the negative binomial when the count of the \ndependent variable diminishes in a smooth decreasing manner (Hilbe 2007: 138). \nThe data we analyze satisfies this condition.  \n32 \naffects terror inflicted by terrorists of one of the allied countries on nationals of \nthe other one and how this effect is dependent on regime type in both countries. \nThe military ties between countries influence the strategic calculation of \nterrorists. Hitting targets from more powerful allies is especially beneficial for \nterrorists in the weaker of the allied countries. \nOur empirical estimations lend ample support to our theory. Military al-\nliances expose nationals of the foreign ally to an increased risk of terrorism from \nthe home country and the more so the more powerful the foreign ally is relative \nto the home country. A higher level of democracy in the political regime of the \nforeign ally increases the joint effect of foreign alliance and power differentials \nfurther, while, conversely, a higher level of democracy in the home country \nreduces the strength of the interaction effect as the terror entrepreneurs\u2019 \nstrategic interest shifts away from targeting citizens of the foreign ally and to-\nward the benefits of targeting nationals from the terrorists\u2019 home country. \n33 \nReferences \nAbadie, A., 2006, Poverty, Political Freedom, and the Roots of Terrorism. \nAmerican Economic Review 96, 50-56. \nAi, C. and E.C.
