FISHKIN, DONALD P. GREEN,\nCHRISTIAN LIST, ROBERT C. LUSKIN AND ELIZABETH LEVY\nPALUCK*\nUsing data from a randomized field experiment within a Deliberative Poll, this paper examines\ndeliberation\u2019s effects on both policy attitudes and the extent to which ordinal rankings of policy options\napproach single-peakedness (a help in avoiding cyclical majorities). The setting was New Haven,\nConnecticut, and its surrounding towns; the issues were airport expansion and revenue sharing \u2013 the\nformer highly salient, the latter not at all. Half the participants deliberated revenue sharing, then the\nairport; the other half the reverse. This split-half design helps distinguish the effects of the formal on-\nsite deliberations from those of other aspects of the treatment. As expected, the highly salient airport\nissue saw only a slight effect, while much less salient revenue-sharing issue saw a much larger one.\nFed by normative concerns and empirical questions about the quality of public opinion\nand popular decision making, recent years have seen the emergence of a growing body of\nresearch on deliberation\u2019s ability to improve matters.1 Some of the most apt data, in our\nview, come from Deliberative Polling, which seeks to gauge the opinions people would\n* Farrar and Green: both at Yale University, Institution for Social and Policy Studies, and Depart-\nment of Political Science, respectively; Fishkin: Department of Communication, Stanford University;\nList, Departments of Philosophy and Political Science, London School of Economics and Political\nScience; Luskin, Department of Government, University of Texas at Austin (email: rcluskin@mail.\ntexas.edu); Paluck: Department of Psychology and Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International\nAffairs, Princeton University.

Druckman,\nhold if they knew and thought more about the issues. The design gives random samples\nboth balanced information and the opportunity of talking with one another and question-\ning policy experts. Beginning in 1994, there have been more than thirty national, regional\/\nstatewide\/provincial and local Deliberative Polls (DPs) in the United States, Britain,\nAustralia, Denmark, Hungary, Bulgaria, Italy, Northern Ireland, China and Brazil. More\nrecently, there have also been two transnational (pan-European) and four on-line DPs\n(the latter all national and all in the United States).2\nThe present study examines three important hypotheses about deliberation\u2019s effects.\nThe first is that deliberation frequently alters policy attitudes (continuous dispositions\ntowards policy alternatives) \u2013 not only at the individual level (\u2018gross change\u2019) but in the\naggregate (\u2018net change\u2019). The second is that deliberation tends to bring policy preferences\n(ordinal rankings of policy alternatives) closer to single-peakedness, a help in avoiding\ncyclical majorities of the sort identified by Condorcet and Arrow.3 The third is that\nboth these effects tend to be stronger for less salient issues, on which less deliberation\nhas already occurred. Since very few issues are highly salient, these hypotheses together\nimply an important role for deliberation in shaping majorities and making them\nmeaningful.\nThe before-and-after contrasts in Deliberative Polling are consistent with all three\nhypotheses. The experience does frequently change policy attitudes and bring policy\npreferences closer to single-peakedness.4 The less salient the issue, moreover, the greater\nthese changes.5 But this evidence still leaves some important questions.\nOne preliminary question is the extent to which the before-and-after changes result\nfrom the DP experience at all. The whole public, after all, could be changing at the same\ntime, in the same ways, and to the same degree. That may be generally unlikely but is at\nleast possible for issues sufficiently in the headlines and on people\u2019s lips.6 Several previous\nDPs have therefore compared the participants to \u2018quasi-control groups\u2019 consisting of\neither reinterviewed \u2018non-participants\u2019 (members of the initial random sample who\ndeclined to participate) or an independent random sample interviewed at roughly the time\n(F\u2019note continued)\n\u2018Political Preference Formation: Competition, Deliberation, and the (Ir)relevance of Framing Effects\u2019,\nAmerican Political Science Review, 98 (2004), 671\u201386.\n2 See James S.

The DP treatment includes everything from the initial interview to the final\nquestionnaire: among other things, the invitation to participate; briefing materials laying\nout competing arguments; a weekend\u2019s worth of formal, balanced deliberation in both\nsmall group discussions and plenary questioning of panels of policy experts and policy\nmakers; the casual, generally much less balanced anticipatory deliberation between the\ninitial interview and the weekend; and the conversational spillover into corridors and\ndining rooms during the weekend. Of particular interest is the formal, on-site delibera-\ntion. The whole intervention may be considered broadly deliberative, but this is the heart\nof it, as well as the greatest departure from the participants\u2019 everyday experience and the\nclosest approximation to what theorists of \u2018deliberative democracy\u2019 have in mind.\nThis study uses a randomized experiment within a DP to estimate the effect of the\nformal, on-site deliberation. The experiment randomly assigns the participants to deliber-\nate one or the other of two distinct policy issues, one much more salient than the other,\n7 Of course, both samples are corroded \u2013 unequally \u2013 by non-response\/non-participation, depriving\nthese comparisons of the full authority of true random assignment. Barabas\u2019s analysis of much the same\nquestion involves broadly similar quasi-control groups (created in his case by matching), though with a\nhighly non-random participant sample and hence lesser external validity.\n8 See also James S.

The\nmidterm measurement \u2013 at the point at which the participants have all had the same\ntreatment, except for deliberating one issue versus the other \u2013 is particularly revealing. To\nthe extent that it is the on-site deliberation that is producing the overall change, the\nattitude change and approach to single-peakedness should be greater, on each issue,\namong those who have just finished deliberating that issue than among those who have\njust finished deliberating the other issue. We also expect the deliberation to have a greater\neffect on the less salient issue.\nDELIBERATION AND SALIENCE, POLICY ATTITUDES AND PROXIMITY\nTO SINGLE-PEAKEDNESS\nOur first hypothesis, again, is that deliberation frequently produces aggregate change in\npolicy attitudes, regarded as continuous dispositions towards policy alternatives. Individual-\nlevel change should be common. Even in ordinary surveys, respondents frequently give\ndifferent answers when reinterviewed, partly or mostly as a result of non-attitudinal\nbouncing-around.13 The deliberation in Deliberative Polling should make for greater and\nmore purposive change. Some participants can be expected to draw truer, tauter con-\nnections between their policy attitudes and their own more fundamental values and\ninterests. Others may redefine their interests or re-weight their values (perhaps sometimes\ngravitating towards thinking in terms of a wider public interest).14 Of course, these\nindividual-level changes could largely cancel out, with some participants moving one way,\nand others moving equally the other way: there could be much gross but little net change.\nBut there is no reason to expect that, and considerable reason to suspect the contrary,\ngiven some correlation between interests and initial thought and information. Which way\nany net change should run is another question, beyond our scope here. The answer\nundoubtedly depends on the issue and the setting, but net change should in any event be\ncommon \u2013 as the evidence from previous DPs confirms.15\nOur second hypothesis concerns policy preferences, regarded as ordinal rankings of\npolicy alternatives. Here, our contention \u2013 that deliberation tends to increase what we\nshall call \u2018proximity to single-peakedness\u2019 \u2013 needs more explanation. A combination of\npreferences is single-peaked across individuals if the alternatives can be aligned on some\n\u2018structuring\u2019 dimension, say from left to right, such that every individual has a most\npreferred alternative and a decreasing preference for other alternatives as they get more\n13 Philip E. Converse, \u2018The Nature of Belief Systems in Mass Publics\u2019, in David E. Apter, ed., Ideology\nand Discontent (New York: Free Press, 1964). Cf. Jennifer Hill and Hanspeter Kriesi, \u2018An Extension and\nTest of Converse\u2019s \u2018\u2018Black-and-White\u2019\u2019 Model of Response Stability\u2019, American Political Science Review,\n95 (2001), 397\u2013414.\n14 To the extent that the first mechanism predominates, we should expect to see attitudes change so as\nto increase their predictability from socio-demographic variables, proxying interests; to the extent that\nthe second predominates, they may change so as to decrease it. See Luskin, Fishkin and Jowell,\n\u2018Considered Opinions\u2019; Robert C. Luskin, \u2018The Heavenly Public: What Would the Ideal Citizenry Be\nLike?\u2019, in Michael B. MacKuen and George Rabinowitz, eds, Electoral Democracy (Ann Arbor: University of\nMichigan Press, 2003).\n15 Across fifty policy attitude indices in seven DPs, the mean absolute net change of opinion ranges\nfrom 0.068 to 0.117, averaging 0.092, impressively large for net attitude change (for reasons sketched in\nLuskin 2002). Thirty-four (68 per cent) of the fifty indices show statistically significant net change. See\nLuskin, Fishkin and Hahn, \u2018Deliberation and Net Attitude Change\u2019.\n336 FARRAR AND OTHERS\ndistant in either direction from it.16 This is single-peakedness as originally defined by\nBlack and Arrow,17 sometimes called \u2018ordinal\u2019 single-peakedness, as distinct from the\n\u2018cardinal\u2019 or \u2018spatial\u2019 single-peakedness in the spatial voting model.18\nSingle-peakedness matters because it affords an escape from the possibility of cyclical\ncollective preferences in pairwise majority voting, as in Condorcet\u2019s paradox.19 If one\nthird of an electorate prefer x to y to z, another third prefer y to z to x, and the remaining\nthird prefer z to x to y, two-to-one majorities prefer x to y, y to z, and z to x. The winning\nalternative depends on the pair of alternatives put forward. Such \u2018majority cycles\u2019 and\ntheir numerous generalizations20 undermine the meaningfulness of majority rule.21 But\nsingle-peakedness precludes cycling,22 ensuring a Condorcet winner (an alternative that\nbeats, or is tied with, all others in pairwise majority voting).\nNote that single-peakedness is a binary property \u2013 a combination of preferences is\neither single-peaked, or it is not \u2013 that in populations (or samples) of any size is\nexceedingly unlikely ever to obtain. Following List, Luskin, Fishkin and McLean,23 we\ntherefore define proximity to single-peakedness as S5m\/n, where m is the size of the\nlargest subset of sample members whose combination of preferences is single-peaked and\nn is the overall sample size (m< n).24 If there were a dimension on which everyone\u2019s\npreferences were single-peaked, m would equal n, and S would equal 1.25 Proximity to\n16 For example, consider a population\/sample of four individuals, with (declining) preference orderings\n(x, y, z), (z, y, x), (y, x, z), and (y, z, x). These preference orderings are single-peaked, with structuring\ndimension [x, y, z]. Each individual has a first preference, a second preference on one side of it, and a third\npreference no \u2018closer\u2019 (in terms of ordinal slots) to it. By contrast, if a fifth individual with the preference\nordering (x, z, y) is added to this population\/sample, the preferences are no longer single-peaked. They are\nnot single-peaked with respect to the structuring dimension [x, y, z], because the fifth individual prefers x,\nthen z, which is \u2018further\u2019 than y from x on this dimension. And there is no other possible structuring\ndimension (left\u2013right ordering of x, y and z) with respect to which all five preference orderings are single-\npeaked. For a more precise definition, see List, Luskin, Fishkin and McLean, \u2018Deliberation, Single-\nPeakedness, and the Possibility of Meaningful Democracy\u2019.\n17 Duncan Black, \u2018On the Rationale of Group Decision-Making\u2019, Journal of Political Economy, 56\n(1948), 23\u201334 and Kenneth Arrow, Social Choice and Individual Values.\n18 See Steven J.

See the further\ndiscussion below and in List, Luskin, Fishkin and McLean, \u2018Deliberation, Single-Peakedness, and the\nPossibility of Meaningful Democracy\u2019.\nDisaggregating Deliberation\u2019s Effects 337\nsingle-peakedness bears a strong positive relationship to the probability of the existence of\na Condorcet winner and a strong negative relationship to the probability of cycles.26\nDeliberation should increase proximity to single-peakedness.27 As people talk, learn and\nthink about the relationships between the alternatives and the criteria for choosing between\nthem, they may simply adopt an ordering they come to recognize as conventional among\npolitical elites. Or they may influence each other\u2019s thinking, acquiring more of a shared\nunderstanding of what the relevant issue-space is and how the alternatives are positioned\nwithin it. Or they may independently excogitate a natural ordering urged if not quite com-\npelled by logic. By whatever mix of such mechanisms, deliberation should tend to make\npreferences more single-peaked,28 and the evidence from previous DPs suggests that it does.29\nOur third hypothesis is that both these effects should be weaker for more salient issues,\nwhich have already received more real-world deliberation. If the issue is salient enough,\nmany people may already be near their full-information positions, if the real-world delibera-\ntion is sufficiently good, or entrenched far from them, if not. In either case, there is less\nopportunity for Deliberative Polling to have much effect (although, if the real-world\ndeliberation is sufficiently flawed, it might, if the DP lasted far longer than a weekend). Thus\nthe before-and-after contrasts in previous DPs have tended to show larger net attitude\nchanges and smaller increases in proximity to single-peakedness for less salient issues.30\nTHE SPLIT-HALF DELIBERATIVE POLL: DESIGN AND MEASUREMENT\nTo isolate the effects of the formal on-site deliberations, we have built a fully randomized\nfield experiment into a DP. A random sample drawn from the fifteen towns surrounding\nNew Haven, Connecticut, deliberated two issues: the level of service to be provided by the\n26 Niemi, \u2018Majority Decision-Making with Partial Unidimensionality\u2019. This is also supported by\ncomputer simulations reported in List, Luskin, Fishkin, and McLean, \u2018Deliberation, Single-Peakedness,\nand the Possibility of Meaningful Democracy\u2019.\n27 See David Miller, \u2018Deliberative Democracy and Social Choice\u2019, Political Studies, 40 (1992: special\nissue): 54\u201367; Jack Knight and James Johnson, \u2018Aggregation and Deliberation: On the Possibility of\nDemocratic Legitimacy\u2019, Political Theory, 22 (1994), 277\u201396; Christian List, \u2018Two Concepts of Agree-\nment\u2019, PEGS: The Good Society, 11 (2003), 72\u20139; List, Luskin, Fishkin and McLean, \u2018Deliberation,\nSingle-Peakedness, and the Possibility of Meaningful Democracy\u2019.

In fact, the results in List, Luskin, Fishkin and\nMcLean, \u2018Deliberation, Single-Peakedness, and the Possibility of Meaningful Democracy\u2019, suggest that it\nmay decrease agreement of this sort. Our only claim here is that deliberation increases proximity to single-\npeakedness, an instance of what List calls \u2018agreement at a meta-level\u2019. See List, \u2018Two Concepts of\nAgreement\u2019.\n29 Across thirteen issues, the index of \u2018proximity to single-peakedness\u2019, defined below, increases by an\naverage of 0.101, on a scale that runs from a variable minimum always. 0 to 1.0. Across the ten low to\nmoderate salience issues, the average was 0.134 (computed from Table 2 in List, Luskin, Fishkin and\nMcLean, \u2018Deliberation, Single-Peakedness, and the Possibility of Meaningful Democracy\u2019).\n30 Across seven DPs, the correlation between pre-deliberation knowledge, proxying salience, and the\nmean absolute net change for all the policy attitude indices in that DP is 2.61. See Luskin, Fishkin,\nand Hahn, \u2018Deliberation and Net Attitude Change\u2019. Across thirteen DPs, the correlation between pre-\ndeliberation knowledge and the increase in \u2018\u2018proximity to single-peakedness\u2019\u2019 (defined below) is 2.59\n(computed from Tables 1 and 3 in List, Luskin, Fishkin, and McLean, \u2018Deliberation, Single-Peakedness,\nand the Possibility of Meaningful Democracy\u2019).\n338 FARRAR AND OTHERS\nlocal airport and what, if any, sharing there should be of property-tax revenues from new\ncommercial development.\nThese issues differed markedly in salience. The airport was centre stage, revenue sharing\nbarely in the theatre. Over the preceding year, the region\u2019s most widely circulated daily\nnewspaper mentioned revenue sharing only seven times31 but ran seventy-four articles, plus\neditorials and letters from citizens, on airport expansion. The airport coverage spanned the\nfull range of commonly held views. Thus the participants would already have thought, learnt\nand talked far more about the airport than about revenue sharing. Their airport attitudes\nwould have been more firmly rooted, their airport preferences already closer to single-peaked.\nThe on-site deliberations extended from the evening of Friday, 1 March, through\nmidday on Sunday, 3 March 2002. Of an initial interview sample of 1,032, a total of 133\nshowed up. The Friday evening session, at which participants dined with members of their\nrandomly assigned small groups, was designed to orient the participants and acquaint\nthem with one another. The actual deliberations began Saturday morning. Those inter-\nviewees who said they would attend were sent the briefing materials, and those who did\nattend were paid $200 on completing the final questionnaire.\nThe participants were generally representative. Compared with the \u2018non-participants\u2019\n(the initial interviewees who did not attend), they were somewhat more highly educated\nand more likely to be from New Haven itself but comparable in income, gender, race and\nvoter registration (see Appendix A for details). The geographic bias, probably attrib-\nutable to the longer commute from suburbs and outlying towns, does not seem to affect\nthe results. The views of those residing in New Haven moved in the same direction and to\nthe same extent as the views of those residing in the surrounding towns.\nThe sixteen small groups were randomly assigned to one of the two possible orders in\nwhich the two issues could be deliberated. Eight groups (containing sixty-four particip-\nants) deliberated the airport Saturday morning and revenue sharing Saturday afternoon,\nand the other eight (containing sixty-eight participants) the reverse. We denote these two\ntreatment groups as \u2018A-first\u2019 and \u2018R-first\u2019, respectively.32\nThe formal on-site deliberations consisted of three \u2018deliberative sessions\u2019, each invol-\nving both small-group discussions and plenary questions-and-answers with panels of\npolicy experts and advocates. The first two sessions, occupying the whole of Saturday,\nconcentrated on one issue apiece, with the first confined to the airport for the A-first\ntreatment group and to revenue sharing for the R-first treatment group, and the second to\nrevenue sharing for the A-first group and to the airport for the R-first group.33 The third,\non Sunday morning, was more synoptic, with all the participants revisiting both issues in\ntheir small groups and then questioning a panel of local and state officials about both.\nThere were three waves of measurement: the initial telephone interview (T1), a written\nversion of the same questionnaire after the first deliberative session (T2), and the same\nwritten version (plus a few additional questions) again at the end of the weekend (T3).\nThe T1-T2 interval thus spans both the first deliberative session on-site and the casual,\n31 There was much discussion of residential property taxes and property tax relief for the elderly,\ndisabled and low-income, but regional revenue sharing was only mentioned briefly in one editorial and as\na low-profile issue in the platform of one unsuccessful mayoral candidate.\n32 We shall thus be referring to two sorts of \u2018groups\u2019 \u2013 the small groups, within which the issues are discussed,\nand the treatment groups, each consisting of eight small groups, which tackle the issues in different sequences.\n33 The A-first and R-first groups thus had different plenary sessions on Saturday but shared a plenary\nsession on Sunday.\nDisaggregating Deliberation\u2019s Effects 339\nanticipatory learning and deliberation between the first interview at T1 and the beginning of\nthe weekend. The T2\u2013T3 interval spans the second and third deliberative sessions on-site.\nFrom the standpoint of the randomized experiment, the T1-T2 changes are particularly\nrevealing. At T2, both treatment groups had had the experience of deliberating in a casual, less\nbalanced way, with relatively homogeneous interlocutors, in the period between the initial\ninterview and their arrival on site. Both had also had the experience of the more formal and\nbalanced deliberation with more heterogeneous interlocutors on site, but on different issues.\nThe A-first group had deliberated the airport but not the revenue sharing, and the R-first group\nthe reverse. Thus the contrast between their T1-T2 changes should reflect the effects of the\nA-first group\u2019s airport deliberations and of the R-first group\u2019s revenue-sharing deliberations.\nThe T2\u2013T3 changes can be used similarly, but less certainly, to assess the effects of the\nsecond deliberative session, in which the R-first small groups switched to the airport, and the\nA-first small groups to revenue sharing. This comparison is harder to interpret, since by T2\neach group had already deliberated the other issue, and the T2\u2013T3 interval bracketed not only\nthe second deliberative session but also the third, during which both issues were deliberated.\nPerhaps discussing revenue sharing is better preparation for discussing the airport than the\nreverse. Perhaps considering them simultaneously at the end alters the effect of the earlier\nsequencing. Or perhaps discussing an issue from T1 to T2 continues to have an effect from T2\nto T3, even while the other issue is discussed. How far the T2-T3 comparison should be\nexpected to mirror the T1-T2 comparison is, therefore, unclear.\nThe questionnaire asked about the main policy alternatives on each issue. For the\nairport, these were:\nA1.Maintaining: \u2018Commercial passenger service to nearby cities should be maintained but\nnot expanded to serve a larger market.\u2019\nA2. Expanding: \u2018Commercial passenger service should be expanded to provide more\nflights to more places.\u2019\nA3. Ending: \u2018Commercial passenger service should be ended, leaving only service for\nprivate airplanes.\u2019\nFor revenue sharing, the main alternatives were:\nR1. Local Control: \u2018My town should maintain local control over all of its tax revenues\nfrom new businesses and industries.\u2019\nR2. Voluntary Sharing: \u2018My town should try for a voluntary agreement with other towns\nin the region to share some of the tax revenues from new businesses and industries.\u2019\nR3. State-encouraged Sharing: \u2018The state should provide incentives for towns in the region\nto share some tax revenues from new businesses and industries.\u2019\nR4. Mandatory Sharing: \u2018The state should require towns in the region to share some tax\nrevenues from new businesses and industries.\u2019\nWith regard to the expected level of sharing, the two non-mandatory sharing options\n(voluntary and state-encouraged) lie between local control, on the one side, and mandatory\nsharing, on the other.\nWe asked policy questions of two distinct sorts: ratings, to gauge attitudes, and rankings, to\ngauge preferences. The rating questions asked whether the respondent agreed strongly, agreed\nsomewhat, neither agreed nor disagreed, disagreed somewhat, or disagreed strongly with each\npolicy option. The ranking questions asked which option was the respondent\u2019s first choice,\nthen which was his or her second choice, and then, in the case of revenue-sharing, which was\nhis or her third choice. The lowest-ranked choice can be inferred from the others.\n340 FARRAR AND OTHERS\nPOLICY ATTITUDES\nAs we shall see, the DP moved the participants towards wanting to end rather than\nexpand airport services and towards favouring non-mandatory revenue sharing over\nboth mandatory sharing and local control. To summarize airport attitudes, therefore,\nwe subtract the ending from the expanding service rating. Scoring both items from 0, for\nstrong disagreement, to 1, for strong agreement, yields a difference that runs from 1\nfor strong agreement with expanding service and strong disagreement with ending it to21\nfor the reverse. To summarize revenue-sharing attitudes, we create two companion\nindices, one pitting the two middle, non-mandatory sharing options against local control,\nand the other pitting them against mandatory sharing. In each case, we average the\nratings of the two non-mandatory options and subtract the rating of the alternative.\nThe indices run from 1 for strong agreement with non-mandatory sharing and strong\ndisagreement with mandatory sharing\/local control and 21 for the reverse.34\nTable 1 shows the results. On the airport, although the sample, from start to finish, was\nmore inclined to expand than to end airport services, that inclination faded significantly\n(p, 0.05) over the course of the experiment. The mean airport attitude decreased\nfrom 0.540 to 0.434. On revenue sharing, the sample initially favoured local control\nover non-mandatory sharing and the latter over mandatory sharing but came to favour\nnon-mandatory sharing over both other options. The mean of the index opposing non-\nmandatory sharing to local control increased from 20.115 to 0.241 (p, 0.001), and that\nof the index opposing non-mandatory to mandatory sharing from 0.166 to 0.385\n(p, 0.001). Note that the more salient airport issue shows less net change (only 0.106,\ncompared to 0.335 and 0.220 on the two revenue-sharing indices). Again these results\necho those of previous DPs, which have frequently shown statistically significant net\nattitude changes and have done so more frequently on less salient issues.\nThe present question, however, is the extent to which the net change results from the\nformal on-site deliberations. Thus consider the contrast between the two treatment groups\nover the T1-T2 interval. Take first the less salient revenue-sharing issue, where the net\nchange is much greater. The mean attitude shifts dramatically from local control towards\nnon-mandatory sharing in the R-first group, discussing the issue during this interval\n(0.313), but scarcely budges in the A-first group discussing the airport instead (20.012).\nThe difference is highly significant (p, 0.001). The contrast is fainter but similar for non-\nmandatory versus mandatory sharing. From T1 to T2, the R-first group moves twice\nas far towards non-mandatory sharing (0.085 versus 0.039), although in this case the\n0.085 is not quite significant (p5 0.115), and the difference between 0.085 and 0.039 is\ninsignificant. In all, these results suggest that the on-site deliberations drove most of\nthe net attitude change on revenue sharing.\n34 One might expect preferences to reflect attitudes \u2013 more after deliberation than before and more, at\nleast initially, on the airport than on revenue sharing \u2013 and the results bear this out. Maximum likelihood\nestimation of binomial logit models expressing preferences for expanding airport service over ending it,\nfor non-mandatory revenue sharing over local control, and for non-mandatory over mandatory revenue\nsharing as functions of the respective attitude indices produce pre- and post-deliberation (McFadden\u2019s)\npseudo-R2s of 0.479 and 0.680, 0.377 and 0.345, and 0.099 and 0.371, respectively. Preferences are indeed\nrelatively well predicted by attitudes by the end of the process, are indeed initially better predicted on the\nairport than on revenue sharing, and are indeed better predicted after than before deliberation in two of\nthe three cases. More detailed results are available on request.\nDisaggregating Deliberation\u2019s Effects 341\nTABLE 1 Policy Attitude Changes\nT1 T2 T3 T2-T1 Sig. T3-T2 Sig. T3-T1 Sig.\nA. The Airport: Ending v.

Here it is\nthe A-first group, now discussing revenue sharing, that moves furthest towards non-\nmandatory sharing. The R-first group continues to move in the same direction, perhaps as\na delayed effect of their earlier deliberation, but less so. When the question is non-\nmandatory sharing versus local control, the change is 0.318 in the A-first group versus\n0.090 in the R-first group; when it is non-mandatory versus mandatory sharing, it is 0.221\nversus 0.097. In both cases, the difference is highly significant (p, 0.001, p5 0.064).\nThe results on the airport, a more salient issue, where there is less net attitude change to\napportion, are weaker and more mixed. From T1 to T2, both treatment groups shift\ntowards ending the service. Here too it is the group discussing the issue that changes\nnoticeably more (0.168 versus 0.085), and the 0.168 is statistically significant (p5 0.027),\nwhile the 0.085 is not (p5 0.175). The difference between the 0.168 and the 0.085, how-\never, is statistically insignificant (p5 0.386), and neither treatment group shows any real\nchange from T2 to T3. These results suggest some slight effect of the on-site deliberation\nbut also suggest some effect of the casual at-home deliberations preceding (and stirred by\nthe prospect of) the deliberative weekend: thus the noticeable and not-too-different\nchanges in both treatment groups from T1 to T2, the interval containing the at-home\ndeliberations, and the stability of both from T2 to T3.\nPROXIMITY TO SINGLE-PEAKEDNESS\nOur second hypothesis is that deliberation tends to increase proximity to single-peakedness,\ndefined, as above, as S5m\/n. Two further points about S are worth noting. First, S\nnecessarily< 1, and if all individual preference orderings are strict (no one is indifferent\nbetween any pair of alternatives), S also>Sm5 2\n(k21)\/k!. 0, where k is the number of\nalternatives.35 When k5 3 (as on the airport), Sm5 2\/3; when k5 4 (as on revenue-sharing),\nSm5 1\/3. Since our data inevitably contain incomplete rankings, implying non-strict\norderings, however, Sm is only an approximate lower bound. Secondly, the dimension on\nwhich m is premised (the one on which the largest subset of participants has single-peaked\npreferences) may vary with the treatment group, over time, or both. This leaves S\u2019s sampling\ndistribution unknown, although its standard error may be bootstrapped.\nTable 2 shows S and its bootstrapped standard error for both the whole sample and the\ntwo treatment groups at all three measurements.36 Absent S\u2019s sampling distribution, we\nrefrain from assertions of statistical \u2018significance\u2019 or \u2018insignificance\u2019,37 but the estimated\nstandard errors make it hard to imagine that the larger changes and differences would be\ninsignificant.\nThe results mostly parallel those for attitudes. Overall \u2013 across the whole sample from\nT1 to T3 \u2013 both issues show increased proximity to single-peakedness. Again, and again in\nkeeping with other DP results,38 the change is minor (0.77 to 0.81) on the high salience\n35 Niemi, \u2018Majority Decision-Making with Partial Unidimensionality\u2019.\n36 A thousand random samples of the relevant subjects were drawn with replacement. The standard\ndeviation of the resampled S provides the estimate of the standard error.\n37 The bootstrapped standard errors, moreover, are for S, not the difference between the values of S at\ndifferent times, which may be somewhat larger or (less likely) smaller, depending on the sign and magnitude of\nthe covariance.\n38 List, Luskin, Fishkin and McLean, \u2018Deliberation, Single-Peakedness, and the Possibility of Meaningful\nDemocracy\u2019.\nDisaggregating Deliberation\u2019s Effects 343\nairport issue but major (0.52 to 0.80) on the low salience revenue-sharing one.39 On the\nairport, the contrast between treatment groups suggests little evidence of the on-site\ndeliberation\u2019s having had much effect. S hardly budges, for either treatment group. On\nrevenue sharing, however, each treatment group shows a large increase, and almost\nentirely during the interval during which it deliberates the issue on site. From T1 to T2, S\nincreases by 0.31 in the R-first group but only by 0.07 in the A-first group. From T2 to T3,\nit increases by 0.21 in the A-first group but decreases by 0.02 in the R-first group.40 As in\nthe case of net attitude change, the DP\u2019s effect on proximity to single-peakedness appears\nto be mostly an effect of the on-site deliberation.\nDISCUSSION\nThese results comport with the notion that deliberation tends to produce net attitude change\nand bring preferences closer to single-peakedness, at least on issues of low to moderate\nsalience, if not necessarily on the most salient. We know from previous DP results that there\nis a strong negative correlation between the approach to single-peakedness and the magni-\ntude of the net change, on the one hand, and the salience of the issue, on the other. On\nsufficiently salient issues, both the mean attitude and the proximity to single-peakedness may\nsit relatively still. But on less salient issues, where the DP produces more movement, it\nappears from these results, admittedly based on only two issues, to be the on-site delibera-\ntion that is responsible for the lion\u2019s share of it. The highly salient airport issue sees only\nminor change, while the not at all salient revenue sharing issue sees very large changes,\nmostly during the interval during which the issue is deliberated on site.\nTABLE 2 Changes in Proximity to Single-Peakedness (S)*\nn T1 T2 T3\nA.

On revenue sharing, the dimension along which the largest sub-sample is single-\npeaked also remains the same throughout, ordering the alternatives as [R1 R2 R3 R4], although the\nCondorcet winner changes from one non-mandatory sharing option to the other \u2013 from R3 (state-\nencouraged sharing) at T1 to R2 (voluntary sharing) at T3.\n40 In each treatment group, the Condorcet winner changes from R3 to R2 over the interval during which\nthe group deliberates the issue \u2013 from T1 to T2 in the R-first group and from T2 to T3 in the A-first group.\n344 FARRAR AND OTHERS\nWe previously based this assessment of relative salience on local newspaper coverage,\nbut our data provide additional evidence. Consider in this light the T1 proximity to single-\npeakedness: at T1, S is only 0.52 for revenue sharing but 0.77 for the airport. Of course,\nthat gap might be thought to exist simply because S\u2019s approximate lower bound Sm is 1\/3\nfor the revenue-sharing issue, with its four alternatives, but 2\/3 for the airport, with its\nmere three. But the adjusted measure S05 (S2Sm)\/(12Sm), taking account of the\nnumber of alternatives, is still noticeably higher for the airport (0.32) than for revenue\nsharing (0.27) at T1.41 So the initial difference in proximity to single-peakedness is not\nsimply due to the difference in the number of alternatives. The participants would appear\nto have entered the process already having thought more about and thus acquired more\nsingle-peaked preferences about the airport issue.\nThe levels of relevant T1 knowledge lend further support. At all three waves, we\nasked the participants whether (1) the region\u2019s population was closest to 250,000,\n350,000, 550,000 or 750,000; (2) its rate of growth in employment during the 1990s was\nmore than, about the same as, or less than in the rest of the United States; (3) New\nHaven\u2019s population increased, decreased or did not change during the 1990s; (4) the\nmajor source of revenue for most of the region\u2019s town governments is sales taxes,\nproperty taxes, direct state subsidies or direct federal subsidies; (5) state law allows\ncommunities to share property tax revenues; (6) those communities with the most\nvaluable property tend to have the lowest, average or the highest property tax rates; (7)\nthe Federal Aviation Authority classifies the regional airport as a major hub, a medium\nhub, a minor hub or not a hub; and (8) maintaining the regional airport at its current\nlevel of service would require any significant investment. The correct answers are (1)\n555,000, (2) less, (3) decreased, (4) property taxes, (5) yes, (6) the lowest, (7) a non-hub,\nand (8) yes. Items (7) and (8) are specifically relevant to the airport, items (4) \u2013 (6)\nspecifically relevant to revenue sharing, and items (1) \u2013 (3) generally relevant to the\npolitics of the region.\nTable 3 shows the percentages of the whole sample and of the two treatment groups\nanswering the two airport items, the three revenue-sharing items, the three general items\nand all eight items correctly at T1, T2 and T3. At T1, the participants averaged answering\n38.6 per cent of the airport questions but only 25.4 per cent of the revenue-sharing\nquestions correctly. Of course, the revenue-sharing knowledge items could simply be\nintrinsically harder. But the fact that by T3 the participants actually fared slightly better\non the revenue-sharing items (59.9 per cent versus 54.2 per cent) suggests otherwise. The\nparticipants would appear to have entered the process knowing substantially more about\nthe airport because it was the more salient issue.\nTable 3 also strengthens the claim that it was in fact deliberation producing the net\nattitude change and approach to single-peakedness. Deliberation entails learning, and, as\nis usual in Deliberative Polling, the participants learnt a great deal. For the whole sample\nacross all eight items, the mean percentage correct increased by 22.3 per cent.42 The gain\n41 In words, S0 is the extent to which S exceeds its minimum, expressed as a fraction of the extent to\nwhich it could do so. Note that S0 necessarily<S (indeed,S for S, 1) and that because Sm is only\napproximate, S0 should be taken as heuristic. For more on S and S0, see List, Luskin, Fishkin and\nMcLean, \u2018Deliberation, Single-Peakedness, and the Possibility of Meaningful Democracy\u2019.\n42 The T1-T2 gains tend to exceed their T2-T3 counterparts, no doubt because T1-T2 is a much longer\ninterval, bracketing the receipt of the briefing materials and the anticipatory, off-site deliberations, as well\nas the first on-site deliberative session.\nDisaggregating Deliberation\u2019s Effects 345\nwas greater on revenue sharing, the less salient issue. The percentage correct increased by\n34.5 per cent on revenue sharing versus 15.5 per cent on the airport.\nThe on-site learning, moreover, appears to be deliberation-based, as the lower tiers of\nTable 3 suggest. From T1 to T2, the participants learnt something, presumably before\narrival, about the issue they were not initially deliberating on site (since the briefing\nmaterials and anticipatory, off-site deliberations covered both) but a good deal more,\npresumably after arrival, about the topic they were deliberating. The A-first group gained\n15.6 per cent on the airport but only 6.3 per cent on revenue sharing, while the R-first\ngroup gained 40.4 per cent on revenue sharing but only 8.8 per cent on the airport. From\nT2 to T3, there was some additional learning but only about the topic being deliberated\nthen. The A-first group gained 18.8 per cent on revenue sharing but less than 1 per cent on\nthe airport, while the R-first group gained 5.9 per cent on the airport but only 2.9 per cent\non revenue sharing.43\nThe net attitude change and increase in proximity to single-peakedness on revenue\nsharing line up nicely with these knowledge gains. From T1 to T2, the A-first group learnt\na good deal about revenue sharing, changed its views a good deal, and showed a modest\nincrease in proximity to single-peakedness. But the R-first group learnt still more,\nchanged its views still more, and showed a much greater increase in proximity to single-\npeakedness. From T2 to T3, the A-first group, then deliberating revenue sharing, learnt a\ngood deal on top of what it had learnt from T1 to T2, changed its views a good deal\nfurther, and added greatly to its T1-T2 increase in proximity to single-peakedness. The\nR-first group learnt only a little, changed its views only a little, and showed no increase in\nproximity to single-peakedness (compare Table 3 with Tables 1 and 2). Thus the net\nattitude change and approach to single-peakedness not only occur when the participants\nTABLE 3 Knowledge Gains\nT1 T2 T3 T2-T1 T3-T2 T3-T1\nA.

They support the\nproposition that at least on policy issues that are not too salient \u2013 the great majority of\npolicy issues \u2013 deliberation frequently changes attitudes and makes preferences more\nsingle-peaked. A more deliberative democracy should, therefore, sometimes produce\nmajorities favouring different policies, parties or candidates and in turn, at least some-\ntimes, bring different governments, enacting different policies. It should also produce\nmore meaningful majorities, based on preferences that are closer to single-peaked.\nAPPEND IX A : DEMOGRAPH IC COMPAR I SONS OF PART IC I PANTS , NON- PART IC I PANTS\nAND VOT ING POPULAT ION\nParticipants Non-participants Voting population\n(n5 132) (n5 1,024)\nAge (in years) 50.1 50.1 47.0\nRegistered to vote 90.2% 88.6% 78.7%\nMarital status\nSingle 30.3% 29.3% 29.0%\nMarried 49.2% 52.4% 52.5%\nDivorced\/Separated\/Widowed 19.7% 17.3% 18.5%\nEducation\nLess than\/some high school 2.3% 4.2% 17.0%y\nHigh school graduate 9.1% 20.2% 30.8%\nSome college 25.0% 21.1% 18.2%\nCollege graduate 28.0% 29.1% 21.7%\nTrade\/Technical 3.0% 2.5% \u2013\nGraduate school 32.6% 22.2% 12.4%\nIncome $61\u201370,000 $61\u201370,000 $64,018\nRace\nAfrican-American 12.1% 7.2% 8.3%y\nCaucasian 72.7% 75.3% 78.1%\nHispanic or Latino* 3.0% 4.4% 9.6%\nOther 9.1% 9.1% 4.0%\nGender\nMale 50.8% 47.2% 46.8%y\nFemale 49.2% 52.8% 53.2%\nNote: Percentages may not add up to 100 in non-participant blocks due to \u2018refusal\u2019 category.\n*For population 15 and over.\nyFor population 25 and over.\nyFor population 18 and over.\nDisaggregating Deliberation\u2019s Effects 347\n"}
