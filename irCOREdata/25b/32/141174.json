The effectiveness of the new product introduction process is\ncritical to their performance. Production ramp-up is a necessary phase of new\nproduct introduction and both planning and execution need careful consideration\nespecially for engineered products which are generally typified by design, purchasing\nand production complexity. Better understanding of the issues and more effective\nmodelling of options should lead to more predictable and quicker ramp-up.\nExamination of the literature, however, reveals little attention has been paid to this\narea. What knowledge exists tends to concentrate on specific aspects such as\ncapacity or learning or costs. This paper reviews the ramp-up literature in general\nalong with the specific components in more detail to establish how current work can\nbe combined to develop the architecture for a modelling tool for engineering product\nramp-up. The contribution of the paper is to provide a wider view of ramp-up, to\npresent it as a topic worthy of consideration in its own right, and to introduce a\nprototype modelling tool which can aid the investigation and solutions of the issues\nthat the paper raises.\nKeywords: production ramp-up modelling, learning curves, new product introduction,\nengineering products\n1 INTRODUCTION\nDemanding customer expectations makes competitiveness a vital issue for any industry. In\nthe engineering products sector in particular, the high level of initial investment needed for\nthe introduction of a new product strengthens the requirement for effective production\nplanning to efficiently utilise resources and avoid waste. If managed well, it can bring\nimportant competitive advantages to companies.\nRamp-up has a notable importance for companies because time-to-volume directly affects\nthe financial success of a product [1]. In particular, time-to-volume has a significant effect\non the net present value and revenues of a project. If the time-to-volume is delayed\nrespect to the forecast, revenues will be postponed; hence a shorter ramp-up reduces the\npayback period and improves financial indicators, such as return on investment and return\non assets compared to a longer one [2]. In addition, market share and revenue can be lost\nif delivery to customer is delayed due to ineffective ramp-up. This is even more apparent in\ncompetitive markets [3].\n*\nCorresponding author: Department of Manufacturing (B50), Cranfield University, Cranfield, Bedfordshire MK43 0AL, UK.\nemail: p.d.ball@cranfield.ac.uk\nProceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part B: Journal of Engineering Manufacture, June 2011, vol. 225, no. 6, pp959-971\n2\nEffective cost analysis is vital in this context to fully understand the feasibility of a new\nproduct and the effort needed. Considering the magnitude of the investment for the ramp-\nup of an engineering product and the importance of the learning phenomenon in the\nproduction process, any planning inaccuracy might have heavy consequences on the\ncompany finances. Having good information can play a crucial role at the early stages of\nthe production planning and decision making process.\nThe introduction of new products onto the shop floor needs to be carefully assessed in\norder to manage them effectively and efficiently. Learning effects are commonly\nregistered during ramp-up. The literature shows some examples of industries for which\nthe ramp-up has been studied due to its importance. Principally, examples include\nelectronics industry [4], automotive [5] and aerospace [6]. In spite of this, the literature\ndoes not provide the depth of information relative to the importance of the topic. Learning\ncurves are extensively explored in the literature as are cost analysis and capacity analysis.\nHowever, there is a gap in the literature when considering these areas together for the\nramp-up of new products, especially engineering products where complexity is high.\nThis paper therefore examines the technical and economic perspectives of ramp-up and\nuses these to develop an architecture for modelling. In turn a prototype modelling tool is\ndeveloped and tested. The contribution is therefore a broader view of ramp-up through the\nintegration of learning, capacity and cost into a modelling approach.\n2 CONTEXT\nThe production of a new item generally shows a ramp-up period during which the\nproductivity and the output rate increase until reaching steady state (serial production) [7].\nThe exact definition in the literature is less clear. Authors differ in the definitions they\nprovide:\n\uf0b7 \u201cramp-up is a technical concept and is the period preceding the market production\nlaunch\u201d [8]\n\uf0b7 ramp-up includes the pre-production and the production stages [9]\n\uf0b7 ramp-up is the \u201cperiod between completion of development and the full capacity\nutilisation\u201d [4]\n\uf0b7 the time from the production of the first item to reach steady-state output rate [3]\n\uf0b7 the time interval from the end of the prototyping phase to the full volume production\n[10]\n\uf0b7 ramp-up is the \u201cinitial period of commercial production [\u2026] it begins at start of\nproduction and finishes when initial targets for, e.g. quality, volume, yield and costs\nare reached\u201d [11]\nAuthors agree on the steep increase of output rate reported during this phase, but they\ndisagree about the chronological limits of the process. Moreover, sometimes terms such\nas ramp-up and start-up are used interchangeably (start-up is the whole phase of output\nrate increase; ramp-up is only the phase during which a steep rise of the output rate is\nverified [5], see Figure 1). Indeed, sometimes the earlier part of the start-up is so short\nthat the two terms coincide. In some cases synonyms are used to indicate the ramp-up\nconcept. Pruett and Thomas [12] for example refer to the \u2018innovation process\u2019 as a set of\nactivities that occur during the product development stage and before regular production\nbegins. Within this work the commercial launching and marketing side discussed by\nLenfle and Midler [8] will be excluded.\nProceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part B: Journal of Engineering Manufacture, June 2011, vol. 225, no. 6, pp959-971\n3\nFigure 1. Distinction between start-up and ramp-up [5]\nThe definition used in this paper is close to the one given by Fjallstrom et al. [11] but is\nmore tightly defined by Agaga et al. [13]: Ramp-up is \u201ca process, normally within a\nmanufacturing environment, where production moves from low rate and gradually\nincreases to the required production rate as the manufacturing processes are proven\u201d.\nIt is generally assumed that production systems not in ramp-up are in steady-state for\nwhich there is a significant body of knowledge. Extensive work exists on designing new\nproduction systems, implementing them and then controlling and improving them.\nRelatively, there is little literature available on non-steady-state production systems,\nincluding ramp-up, despite a growing acceptance of shrinking product life cycles and\nhaving production systems that are responsive to customer requirements.\nIn spite of the number of sources quoted, finding literature on production ramp-up is\nchallenging. A commonly accepted body of knowledge is still missing. What does exist\ntends to be concentrated in large companies [14] and suggests high volume such as that\nexperienced in the automotive industry. This is in contrast to the wealth of knowledge of\ndesigning for and improving systems in steady state. Additionally, there is little available\nevidence of well documented practice in industry. Within the case company examined\nlater, whilst there was a depth of experience of previous product ramp-ups there was an\nabsence of well defined processes with supporting tools. The challenge was how their\ndecision making process surrounding ramp-up could be improved. Comparing the\nimportance of effective ramp-up of new products with the relative unavailability of\ninformation, the contribution of this work is to provide a broad approach to practical\nproduction ramp-up.\n3 AIM AND APPROACH\nThe wider aim of this work is to create a framework by which production ramp-up of\nengineering products can be modelled. In turn the modelling approach can be used to\nassess the impacts of changes to the production system configuration and policies.\nSignificant variables affecting the ramp-up of engineered products are layout space,\ntooling availability, process capability, operator skill and learning rate as well as resulting\nrecurring costs and non-recurring costs. The work was triggered by industrial need. The\nmotivation for pursuing this research was the lack of comprehensive coverage of ramp-up\nProceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part B: Journal of Engineering Manufacture, June 2011, vol. 225, no. 6, pp959-971\n4\nin the literature, the lack of literature on the integration of the above mentioned variables\nand an absence of modelling tools.\nThe research question was \u201cHow can modelling of capacity, learning and costs of\nproduction ramp up be integrated?\u201d The lack of available software and the disparate\nnature of the literature necessitated an exploratory case-based approach. Meredith\u2019s\ntheory creation cycle [15] of description, explanation and testing of was used. The cycle is\niterative with just over one complete cycle to enable useful outcomes to be extracted.\nIn the descriptive phase, the research issue was identified and as a result of exploratory\nanalysis the above research question was established and the research design initiated.\nThe explanation phase of the research would start with a literature review of ramp-up, new\nproduct introduction, learning and costs using well established databases. It was likely\nthat the search would use an evolving collection of key words evident later. Analysis of the\noutcomes of literature review would enable the creation of a conceptual model (later\nreferred to as model architecture). Moving into the testing phase of the research,\ncomponent mechanisms would be developed using software and brought together in a\nfinal software form based on the requirements and data from an industrial case.\nExperimentation using the software would feed into the next descriptive phase through\ntesting both the value of the modelling approach as well as provide benefit to the case\ncompany, thereby showing contributions to both theory as well as practice. Given the start\npoint, alternatives of starting with hypotheses would be difficulty due to lack of integrated\ntheory and using tools such as survey would be challenging due to the lack of common\nand documented methods across industry.\nIn the execution of this methodology, it was clear early on significant literature for particular\nsubject areas exists, however, there was a challenge in sourcing articles that combined\nthe areas. Next concepts and mechanisms were combined to create a modelling tool\narchitecture with a breadth that is absent from the literature. A case company was used to\ntest the architecture through the creation of a prototype modelling tool implemented as a\ncomprehensive spreadsheet. It was not the intention to create a generic modelling tool at\nthis stage. The data for the case specific engineering product manufacturer was entered\nand verified. Finally, experimentation was carried out for different ramp-up scenarios to\nunderstand the specific relationships between process configuration, learning and costs for\ndifferent ramp-up schedules.\n4 RAMP-UP CONCEPTS AND METHODS\n4.1 Scope\nA key element for the lead time decrease and quick production rate achievement is a good\nmanagement of the ramp-up stage. It can be considered as the first gate of the \u2018Stage-\nGate\u2019 model presented in the eighties to guide the new product introduction [16], the first\npractical check of the product feasibility.\nThe criticality of the ramp-up stage is mostly related to the flexibility required. Most\nengineering changes are made during the ramp-up of new products, motivated by\nmanufacturability issues [17]. After the first iterations of the production process, possible\nmistakes in the planning or even in the design of the product become apparent and trigger\nmodifications in the production system. Consequently, the more effort is put in the design\nand planning of the ramp-up, the more efficient it will be in terms of time and cost.\nProceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part B: Journal of Engineering Manufacture, June 2011, vol. 225, no. 6, pp959-971\n5\nReaching the maximum output quickly in turn shortens the time for the investment pay-\nback and decreases the opportunity cost due to revenue losses. Many companies are\neven creating dedicated teams for ramp-up management [8]. They in turn can use ramp-\nup strategies and reference models that are available [e.g. 14,18].\nTo facilitate the progressive increase of production rate, companies should adopt a holistic\nperspective during the ramp-up process [11,19]. The information, should be updated to\nprevent biased interpretations of the performance achieved and wrong decision-making. It\nshould consider all the aspects of the business to obtain a global and meaningful view of\nthe process. Information about product, manufacturing process, equipment required and\nimpact on costs should be available at the early stages to avoid additional costs and risks\nas the project proceeds [20].\nTherefore, assessing ramp-up should consider:\n\uf0b7 the information about process (including learning effects), equipment and costs\n\uf0b7 the flexibility needed to simulate likely engineering changes and appreciate the\neffect on time and costs\n4.2 Learning and forgetting\nThe ramp-up period can be seen as a key opportunity for a company to improve its\nperformance. New methods are put in place for the first time and the real production starts\nup, bringing challenges and initial inertia before achieving acceptable output. Lenfle and\nMidler [8] consider ramp-up as a \u2018key learning opportunity\u2019, where the management effort\nshould be on facilitating process improvement in the shortest amount of time through its\nstaff. The same authors affirm also that workers\u2019 learning is the focal variable to enhance\nthe ramp-up efficiency.\nRamp-up can be defined as a learning process [3]. Pruett and Thomas [12] analyse the\nimpact of learning, traditionally applied to the production process, in product innovation.\nThey include both existing product changes and new product introduction and adopt\nstatistical analyses to develop a correlation model to study the influence of product and\ninnovation variables on company learning. Indeed, the literature agrees that a ramp-up of\noutput rate and learning curve phenomena are strictly correlated. The relationship is so\nstrong that some authors like Pegels [21] tend to overlap the two concepts as differences\nin learning rate imply differences in ramp-up time.\nIf the output rate reached at the end of the ramp-up phase is related to learning, it is\nreasonable to infer that low-volume products have a slower learning than high-volume\nproducts. Additionally, the serial output rate to reach is different. Similarities in processes\nand products support the learning spillage and can limit the uncertainty of the ramp-up [1]\nand shorten the time-to-volume.\nWorkers can learn as well as forget. For this reason some authors also consider the effect\nof forgetting. Authors have developed forgetting models for which characteristics include:\nexperience gained before breaks, duration of breaks and re-learning rates. Where ramp-\nup is continuous and staff profiles are stable, forgetting effects can be considered minimal.\n4.3 Learning curves\nA learning curve (LC) is a mathematical description of the improvement in job performance\ndue to the experience acquired through repetition. Alchian [22] expresses the interest of\nProceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part B: Journal of Engineering Manufacture, June 2011, vol. 225, no. 6, pp959-971\n6\nthe defence industry and U.S. Air Force in LCs, stating that they are applied in planning,\nscheduling and forecasting. Even if the first applications of LCs concerned labour-intensive\noperations like aircraft production, capital-intensive operations can present learning\nphenomena as well [23]. Indeed, all manufacturing companies experience effects of\nlearning [24], hence each kind of industry can take advantage of applying LCs concepts to\nmanagement. In the literature it is possible to find examples of application of the LCs\ntheory to several industries like electronics [23,25], aircraft [22,26], electricity generation\n[27] and ceramic tiles [17].\nBetween the 1930s and 1960s the use of LCs was focused on product manufacturing;\nlater on they were applied to management and organisational issues [27]. Hence, it is\npossible to distinguish between organisational learning and labour learning [28] which will\nhave different learning rates [29]. The idea of organisational learning is that the whole\norganisation is subject to learning, not only the single workers. This can be related with the\nexistence of two orders of learning of, first, learning inducted by execution of tasks and,\nsecond, learning inducted through managerial or engineering action [23].\n4.4 Capacity\nLearning curves (LCs) can bring huge advantages for a company if employed during early\nplanning. The longer the cycle times the more influential the learning, hence this is\nespecially relevant to engineering products. Consideration of LCs in decisions making\n(e.g. materials supply and capacity planning) is vital in such environments [30]. The\neffects of LCs can change also the calculations about variable costs of production [31]. It is\nquite difficult to find in literature examples of LCs applied to capacity planning during ramp-\nup, although this is considered critical by many authors.\nEven if production ramp-up and LCs are strongly linked, it is not easy to find examples of\npractical application of these two concepts. Moreover, the few examples found concern\nhigh volume production like semiconductors [10] and assembly [3]. Despite the amount of\npapers on LC theory and the potential benefits that can derive from more accurate\nresources plans, there is a lack of literature expressly addressing the forecast of\nmanpower requirements by adopting LC theory [28].\n4.5 Costs\nMany studies show cost modelling [e.g. 32] and the effect of learning [e.g. 12].\nAdditionally, the literature describes learning in multiple ways, e.g. Kantor and Zangwill\n[32] use the term \u2018cost progress curve\u2019 as a synonym of LC to stress the cost improvement\nthat can be achieved through learning.\nTo understand the economic effect of LCs, it is vital to identify which costs are affected by\nthem. It is therefore necessary to clarify first the difference between Recurring Costs (RCs)\nand Non-Recurring Costs (NRCs). The literature [e.g. 34,35] provides extensive\ndistinction, namely:\n\uf0b7 RCs are the repetitive expenditure incurred during the building and testing of every\nproduct unit. RCs may be greatly influenced by the effect of LCs [36]. Examples of\nthose costs are basic labour, overtime and rework\n\uf0b7 NRCs are all the costs met at the beginning of the product life cycle and not needed\nfor future units within a certain production interval. Expenditure is incurred once and\nunlikely to occur again in normal conditions. Examples include design, pre-\nproduction engineering analyses, jigs, tooling, machinery and infrastructure costs.\nProceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part B: Journal of Engineering Manufacture, June 2011, vol. 225, no. 6, pp959-971\n7\nNRCs are fixed for a certain production: they are not directly influenced by the LCs\nbecause they represent requirement for the production, so they will increase with\nthe output according to a step shaped function\nAlthough the criteria adopted for the distinction seem straightforward, there is confusion\nabout the way to distinguish between RCs and NRCs [36]. This causes differences from\ncompany to company and in some cases from project to project, depending on the\nbusiness and the internal policy adopted. The absence of broadly accepted definitions\nleads to a lack of clarity about the topic. Simplistically, the distinction between the two\ncategories of cost can be time, i.e. if the expenditure occurs at the beginning of the life\ncycle, it is a NRC. If it occurs during the production it is a RC. However, there are RCs and\nNRCs in all stages. For example, the costs of material and labour of test-units built during\nthe ramp-up phase are considered as RCs while the design and testing costs are NRCs\n[36]. Additionally, the procurement or relocation of capital equipment may be phased as\nnot all capital equipment needs to be purchased or moved when demand is low at the start\nof the ramp up period.\nThere are currently two approaches that reflect two schools of thought [36]:\n\uf0b7 Cost estimating approach: the US Department of Defence (DoD) defines RCs as\n\u201crepetitive elements of development and investment costs that may vary with the\nquantity being produced during any program phase\u201d and NRCs as \u201cthose elements\nof development and investment costs that generally occur only once in the life cycle\nof a system\u201d. So the investment costs can belong to one category or the other\ndepending on their frequency\n\uf0b7 Acquisition approach: the FAR (Federal Acquisition Regulation) defines RCs as\n\u201ccosts that vary with the quantity being produced such as labour and materials\u201d and\nNRCs as \u201cthose costs that are generally incurred on a one-time basis\u201d. So\neverything that is related to testing, research and investment is directly considered\nas NRC\nFurther confusion occurs when comparing the RCs and NRCs with the variable and fixed\ncosts.\n\uf0b7 Firstly, the field where the two cost categories are used is different. RCs-NRCs\nclassification is used to identify the effect of learning and facilitates the cost\nestimating process of a project. Variable-fixed cost classification can be used for\nbreak-even analyses to identify the investment profitability, so it is adopted in\ngeneral financial studies\n\uf0b7 Secondly, the behaviour with the output is different. The association of NRCs with\nfixed costs can be accepted since they do not vary with the output within a certain\ninterval. On the other hand, it is inexact to compare RCs with variable costs\nbecause the recurring overheads, e.g. energy consumption expenses, are instead\nfixed [37]\nOnce the classification of costs has been made, independently of the method followed, the\ntotal manufacturing cost will be obtained adding the RCs and NRCs since they encompass\nall the costs that appear during the product life cycle stages [38]. The Learning Curves\n(LCs) theory is linked to management control and represents a powerful tool for accurate\ncost analysis.\nAs literature explains widely, LCs influence costs during production because of the\nacquired expertise and diminishing time usage and resource waste [28,32]. The LC\nProceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part B: Journal of Engineering Manufacture, June 2011, vol. 225, no. 6, pp959-971\n8\n\u201cprovides an empirical relationship between changes in direct manufacturing costs and the\nvolume of production\u201d [39], so that direct costs can be predicted using the LC.\nLCs shape RCs in a nonlinear way: the first units produced heavily influence RCs and then\nRCs remain constant as the serial or steady state is reached [34]. However, it is important\nto note an anomaly in NRCs which can occur due to the effects of learning during a very\nsteep ramp-up: If the rate of production ramp-up is faster than the rate of learning (i.e. a\nsteep ramp-up at the start of production when cycles are at their longest due to the effects\nof learning), then this can drive a short-term requirement for additional production\nequipment (NRCs) that is greater than the requirement for serial production as suggested\nin [46]. This additional equipment will not be needed once production has ramped up to the\ntarget serial rate, and learning has been achieved. Due to this anomaly, it is often\npreferable to smooth the rate of ramp-up to within the boundaries of NRCs as set by target\nserial production.\n5 RAMP-UP MODELLING\nAvailable literature contains few examples of ramp-up modelling; most of the production\nmodelling literature focuses on steady state of the system [40,41]. Of the modelling work\nthat is available little explicitly links ramp-up with capacity acquisition, learning curves and\ncosts simultaneously.\nTerwiesch and Bohn [4] illustrate an analytical method to describe the ramp-up\nconsidering the capacity as a constraint. The main objective is to optimise the yields-\noutput ratio given a certain level of capacity. Another mathematical model used is the\nStream of Variation (SoV) methodology: it does not directly model the ramp-up but it is\nused to identify the root causes of manufacturing errors during the ramp-up and production\ntime. It traces the propagation of variation along the different processes. The main\nobjective is the elimination of costly trial-and-error and get the product right the first time.\nThe main effect is the reduction of the ramp-up duration [9,42,43]. Winkler et al. [44]\ndevelop a conceptual model with supporting prognosis tools for the management of ramp-\nup projects.\nFleischer et al [45] present detailed ramp-up simulations for the automotive industry for\nvarying levels of ramp-up maturity using capability curves. This work in turn has been\nextended to supply chains and value networks [46]. The work implies volume rather than\nmore complex, lower volume engineered product. Additionally, cost is referred to in this\nwork but it does not feature highly. The literature presents several case studies to illustrate\ncost models built by companies:\n\uf0b7 Mejean and Hope [47] and Kellogg and Phan [48] illustrate models created to study\nthe correlation between the parameters identified and the total cost\n\uf0b7 Rosenberg et al. [49] illustrate a parametric cost model for estimating the costs of\nfuture space missions\n\uf0b7 Roy et al. [50] show the Airframe Cost Model that adopts the distinction of RCs and\nNRCs to give product estimations\n\uf0b7 Rehman [51] develops a prototype for modelling production costs using the\nknowledge-based and case-based approaches\nThe literature contains many references to volume ramp-up, strategies for ramp-up and\nsupport systems for the control of the ramp-up. The models presented in literature mostly\nanalyse the different methodologies to estimate the product cost and study its sensitivity to\nProceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part B: Journal of Engineering Manufacture, June 2011, vol. 225, no. 6, pp959-971\n9\nspecific factors. They do not address the estimation of ramp-up costs considering learning\ncurve effects directly.\nDespite the work from the above authors, the area of ramp-up modelling is immature and\npoorly documented with a lack of general approaches and techniques and poor practical\nexamples. To place in context, this work aligns to the early stages of the configuration\nstage of reference model proposed by H\u00fcntelmann et al. [14].\n6 DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF MODEL ARCHITECTURE\nTo address the short comings evident from the literature a concept for a ramp-up model\nwas created. This in turn defines the prototype ramp-up simulation tool used in the case\ncompany.\nThe output requirements for understanding ramp-up are as follows (both final as well as\nduring ramp-up):\n1. Equipment required and production output (inc. utilisation)\n2. Space requirements (including size and number of production equipment as well as\nstorage)\n3. Recurring Costs (RCs)\n4. Non-Recurring Costs (NRCs)\nFor each of these outputs, inter-related calculations need to be carried out, broadly in the\nsequence specified. In order to carry out these calculations the following inputs are\nrequired:\n1. Equipment required and utilisation: Capacity and reliability of individual machine\ntools; production plan; routings, operation cycle times.\n2. Space requirements: Footprint of individual machine tools; number of machines;\nspace restrictions.\n3. RCs: Staff; staff categories; shifts; pay rates; shift rates; learning curves;\nmaintenance; utilities; consumables; production rates, man hours, Standard Time\nValues (STV).\n4. NRCs: Machine tool requirements and costs; space required; space costs; cycle\ntimes\nIn turn to calculate some of these inputs additional data is required:\n5. Production plan: Demand; product structure.\n6. Learning curves: Learning rates; number of learning phases\nEssentially, therefore there are six major categories of calculations for a broad\nunderstanding of production ramp-up that are interlinked. Examination of the RCs showed\nthat the staff related RCs were largely independent of the production RCs and hence they\ncan be split. Modules can be created to support the now seven major categories of\ncalculations. Taking the inputs and outputs from above, the interrelationships between\nthese modules are shown in Figure 2. The diagram shows the link between capacity,\nlearning and cost driven by the ramp-up production plan. The maximum production rate,\nutilisation and configuration outputs must be generated through optimisation whilst all\nother outputs can be generated through single stage calculations.\nProceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part B: Journal of Engineering Manufacture, June 2011, vol. 225, no. 6, pp959-971\n10\nFigure 2. Conceptual design of a ramp-up modeller showing modules with associated\ninputs and outputs\nRegardless of how this design is implemented, it is important to maintain flexibility in any\ntool to be able to cope with different ramp-up strategies and to be reused during ramp-up\nto model any changes to the chosen ramp-up strategy.\nIn order to implement this conceptual design into a tool for understanding the behaviour of\nramp-up a choice of software implementation has to be made. Modelling tools can range\nfrom bespoke configuration of spreadsheets through to the utilisation of dynamic modelling\nenvironments such as discrete event simulation (DES) software. Spreadsheets (e.g. Excel\n[52]) have the advantage of being readily available and easy to use [53] as well as being\nable to visually hold and manipulate significant amount of data. At the other end of the\nspectrum DES software (e.g. Arena, Simul8 or Witness) are able to model the passage of\ntime, are preconfigured with manufacturing constructs with typical parameter types and\npresent dynamic output numerically as well as graphically. Most tools can represent costs\nto varying degrees of depth and flexibility.\nFor this work, spreadsheets (Microsoft Excel) are an appropriate means for the first\nimplementation of the conceptual design for several reasons. Firstly, spreadsheets have\nconsiderable flexibility and therefore able to cope with this prototype application\ndevelopment. Secondly, spreadsheets can be configured to represent the passage of time\nin broad time intervals for which simulation software could be overly complex. The problem\ndomain here is of a type that is non-steady state and time based for which spreadsheets\nwould not be an obvious choice. However, for the application area of the engineering\nproducts the learning curves span months or more and granularity of time progression is\nless important than for shorter duration, more repetitive ramp up applications. Thirdly, the\ndevelopment of random variation could be incorporated into spreadsheets if appropriate.\nThe learning from this application could inform later more detailed simulation model\ndevelopment.\nLearning curve\nmodel\nProduction\nrequirements\nEquipment\nrequirements\nFloor space\nrequirements\nLearning rate(s) Cycle times\nwith learning\nLearning phases\nStandard times\nNRCs\nProduction plan\nRoutings\nStaff no.\ntype, shifts\nCapacity by type, reliability\nMachines, Production rates\nFloor space allocation\nFloor space, Est. storage space\nSpace utilisation\nMax production rate, Utilisation\nStaff\nrecurring costs\nProduction\nrecurring costs\nNon-recurring\ncosts model\nPay rates (hourly, shift)\nMaintenance\nConsumables\nRCs\nRCs\nUtilities\nMachine footprint\nMachine unit cost\nPhasing of purchase\nProceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part B: Journal of Engineering Manufacture, June 2011, vol. 225, no. 6, pp959-971\n11\nA number of assumptions in this design and its implementation should be noted. The\neffect of inflation was ignored. The model focused on a single product type ramp-up and\nassumed no effects from other ramp-ups or other company activities. Stochastic\nbehaviour was ignored. Although random variables could be incorporated into Excel or\nother tools initially or subsequent to development, it was judged that significant behaviour\ncould be observed running in deterministic mode alone. Additionally, sensitivity analysis\nwas used in the verification as well as experimentation stages which lessened the need for\nrandom variable inclusion. Finally, learning curves are \u2018back-to-back\u2019 and so the forgetting\nfactor between phases of learning is ignored. If it was to be considered, forgetting could\nbe explicitly defined or incorporated in the learning curve for the next phase. In part, this is\nrelated to the assumption of ramping up a single new product and therefore there is no\nmovement of staff.\nFor modelling ramp-up in the breadth described earlier there is little prior work to build on.\nTherefore the focus of the work is on a prototype rather than refining earlier tools.\nAdditionally the work is directed particularly to engineering products that have longer lead-\ntimes than higher volume products hence fidelity in the modelling of time was not\nsignificant. Finally, costing requires significant analysis and hence flexibility here is highly\ndesirable. For these reasons spreadsheets were considered the most appropriate\nplatform on which to build the prototype ramp-up modelling tool. The modules identified\nabove could be implemented across multiple worksheets and workbooks and the flow of\ninformation and types of calculations were more important rather than physical\nimplementation detail.\nThe development of the modelling tool followed the \u2018waterfall model\u2019 of following steps:\nconcept, system requirements, architectural design, detailed design, code & test,\nintegration, deployment [52]. The concept, system requirements and architectural design\nare documented above. Coding and subsequent integration was carried out using\nstandard functionality and bespoke macros wholly within Microsoft Excel. Verification was\nplanned and executed rigorously at module and overall tool level. This identified a number\nof errors that were removed and the tests repeated. The tests included: syntax analysis,\nsemantic analysis, traceability assessment, traces, face validation and sensitivity analysis\n(e.g. [54]) and amounted to many thousands of individual checks. The modelling tool was\nthen repopulated with case company data and experiments performed to inform the design\nand policy setting for a forthcoming significant production ramp-up.\nA screen shot of the modelling tool is shown in Figure 3. This particular screen shot\nshows the production variable and man-hour calculations. It illustrates a particular feature\nof the prototype that enables multiple learning curves to be incorporated to capture the\nbehaviour resulting from multiple waves of capital equipment purchases, release of\nengineering changes or product model evolution. Note: data has been modified and parts\nof the screen shot have been removed to avoid implying the identity of any particular\ncompany or the case company.\nIn the upper part of the spreadsheet the user inputs allow the identification of each of the\nlearning curves (ranges) in order to model the operators\u2019 improvement change over time.\nThis important feature can also be used to simulate possible modifications of the\nproduction process that result in different man-power learning rates. To get the four\nbranches of hyperbola, the user is asked to input the length of the range in terms of\nproduct number, the improvement rate and the site parameters. There are two site\nparameters: STV, which is the theoretical number of man-hours per product, and learning\nProceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part B: Journal of Engineering Manufacture, June 2011, vol. 225, no. 6, pp959-971\n12\nfactor (LF), which is the correction factor to take into account the actual production\nconditions and represents in fact the ratio between the actual man-hours and the planned\nSTV (LF is always >1 so that it increases the number of hours virtually needed). From this\ndata, calculations are carried out in the lower part of the spreadsheet to obtain the amount\nof man-hours necessary to complete the product considered. A learning factor is\ncalculated from the improvement rate and gives the opportunity to find the man-hour factor\n(time reduction in the range due to the learning phenomenon). Eventually the total man-\nhours per product are derived once the theoretical value (pure L\/C) has been corrected\nwith the LF.\nFigure 3. An illustration of the ramp-up modelling tool inputs\nFigure 4 shows typical graphs created by the modelling prototype. Again the waves seen\nin the graphs are a result of incorporating multiple learning curves to capture particular\nbehavioural traits of the case company. The cost results displayed derive from calculations\nbuilt up from the RC and NRC modules.\nFigure 4. An illustration of the ramp-up modelling tool outputs\nProceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part B: Journal of Engineering Manufacture, June 2011, vol. 225, no. 6, pp959-971\n13\nUsing the modelling tool, the production ramp-up plans of an engineering product were\nevaluated. The model was built using typically available data. The cost calculations were\nadapted to the particular company requirements. Whilst the technically possible standard\ntimes could be calculated from previous product equipment data, deriving learning rates\nwas more challenging and these were estimated using historical data as a benchmark.\nThe potentially significant errors arising from choice of learning rates were addressed\nthrough sensitivity analysis.\n7 RESULTS\nExperiments were conducted on product features, learning rates, production technology,\ncycle times, equipment phasing and work allocation. Examples of the experiments carried\nout for the case company are illustrated below and general observations from all\nexperiments are then made. Values are presented as percentage and not in absolute\nvalue for confidentiality reasons.\nThe ramp-up model can be used to assess the impact of variable changes on the\naggregate ramp-up performance. For instance, what does a change in the percentage of\nwork allocated to three different machines at a given operation stage doing the same job,\nimply on floor space requirements and for the total costs of ramp-up (see Table 1 and\nTable 2). The work allocation percentage is not based on utilisation of each machine but\non the capabilities of individual machines to contribute to the overall work, so smaller\nmachines with a varying footprint and output are traded against cost. The impacts are\nsignificant and will have a significant impact on costs.\nAnother test was performed changing the value of the cycle time at the steady stage in\none of the production stages (Table 3). The change in the steady state cycle time value\nalso influences ramp-up due to the effects on the learning rate. The effect of this variable\non the overall cost of ramp-up and on the total cost of ramp-up per year is captured, with\nthe impact of the change more noticeable in years characterised by a high production rate.\nTable 1 \u2013 Percentage variation of floor space requirements due to work allocation\nWork allocation to\nmachines x, y, z (%)\nVariation of floor space requirements (%)\nyear 1 year 2 year 3 year 4\n30-30-40* 0 0 0 0\n10-30-60 -28.7 0 -26.7 -23.1\n12-12-76 -57.4 0 -6.9 -46.3\n25-25-50 0 0 0 0\n40-40-20 -42.6 0 +26.7 +19.4\n* base case\nTable 2 \u2013 Percentage variation of ramp-up costs due to work allocation\nWork allocation to\nmachines x, y, z (%)\nVariation of costs (%)\nyear 1 year 2 year 3 year 4 total\n30-30-40* 0 0 0 0 0\n10-30-60 -1.4 0 -4.9 -7.0 -2.9\n12-12-76 -2.4 0 -2.8 -11.4 -3.6\n25-25-50 0 0 0 0 0\n40-40-20 -0.7 0 +4.0 +6.5 +1.9\n* base case\nProceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part B: Journal of Engineering Manufacture, June 2011, vol. 225, no. 6, pp959-971\n14\nTable 3 \u2013 Percentage variation of ramp-up costs due to steady state cycle time variation\nSteady state cycle\ntime in operation xx\n(% to base case)\nVariation of costs (%)\nyear 1 year 2 year 3 year 4 total\n100* 0 0 0 0 0\n60 0 -1.3 -7.9 -11.6 -4.9\n80 0 -1.3 -4.8 -5.1 -2.6\n120 0 0 +3.2 +5.1 +2.0\n140 0 +1.3 +7.9 +11.6 +4.9\n* base case\nThe tests performed showed that the modelling tool can be used to assess different ramp-\nup scenarios in order to choose the one that best fits the organisation\u2019s objectives. These\nresults focus on particular areas of experimentation. Other experimentation was carried\nout and general, observations were made. The observations that follow are in general\nobvious but the impact of them requires the modelling tool to evaluate.\nThe major learning benefit occurs early in the production ramp-up and the staff skill level\nrequired has a major impact on recurring costs. Hence to minimise recurring cost (RC)\nparticular attention should be paid to simplifying operator tasks and initial training.\nBy increasing the rate of learning, the ramp-up will be faster and RCs lower. To\ncounteract the learning effects and achieve a higher ramp-up rate than possible with the\nrate of learning then higher Non-Recurring Costs (NRCs) must be incurred earlier. This\ncould result in short-term requirement for additional production equipment (NRC) than is\nrequired for later, steady-state production. Due to this anomaly, it is typical to smooth the\nrate of ramp-up to within the boundaries of NRCs as set by target serial production.\nRelationships between the variables covered in this paper are difficult to generalise as\nthey are specific to the case in question that is heavily influenced by the product features,\nproduction volumes, ramp rates, labour costs, etc. Hence, application of sensitivity\nanalysis for particular cases is important to understand the general behaviour and\nparticular risk areas in the production ramp-up planning.\n8 DISCUSSION\nThe development of the production ramp-up modelling prototype has drawn extensively\nfrom different areas of available literature. The work addresses a knowledge gap through\nthe integration of these areas - capacity, learning curves and costs for ramp-up. The\nmodules created in the modelling tool align to these particular areas of focus. Through the\nuse of standard modelling techniques and verification, experimentation can then be\nperformed for a particular company data set.\nThe strength of the modelling tool lies in its ability to evaluate the robustness of particular\nramp-up scenarios and explain subsequent adherence to financial planning. The modelling\ntool explicitly demonstrates that poor financial adherence tends to result from changes in\nRecurring Costs (RCs) due to changes in the production system (e.g. introduction of\nmodifications) and the subsequent difficulties in recovering the backlog that ensues. In\nturn, the tool demonstrates that this directly impacts ramp-up capability.\nProceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part B: Journal of Engineering Manufacture, June 2011, vol. 225, no. 6, pp959-971\n15\nThe values of cost and other metrics for particular ramp-up approaches can be assessed\nboth in absolute terms as well as for sensitivity to variation of particular inputs. In\nassessing this, the importance of the distinction between RCs and NRCs as discussed\nearlier is clear. For example, an RC cost will be impacted by the position on the Learning\nCurve, whereas an NRC will not.\nThe ramp-up prototype was developed to calculate output and costs according to learning\nand production inputs. Multiple learning phases can be modelled to show the impact of\nmajor changes in production. For instance, product design modifications will drive alternate\nramp-up capabilities depending on whether they are introduced individually or in batches.\nOptimisation has been built into the tool to back calculate the ramp-up rates according to\nthe phasing of available space and equipment. The common theme here is working with\nmultiple constraints in an integrated way.\n9 CONCLUDING REMARKS\nThe body of knowledge in the area of production ramp-up is limited and typically focuses\non narrow aspects of the field of learning curves, capacity or costs. Additionally, there is\nan absence of tools and methodologies specifically addressing ramp-up.\nThis paper has explored the literature and identified the key components of an architecture\nfor modelling production ramp-up of engineering products. The objective was addressed\nthrough the development of a spreadsheet based prototype described.\nThe work has shown how the different aspects of production ramp-up can be considered\ntogether in a single integrated tool. In turn this could provide greater understanding of a\nparticular product ramp-up strategy leading to lower time and cost in decision making. In\nparticular it has shown the ability to consider capacity, complex learning curves and broad\ncost analysis simultaneously in ramp-up. Thereby, this work has provided an insight into a\nlink between the forecasting of labour requirements and learning curve theory that is\nlacking in the literature.\nIt is the interaction of the breadth of factors that influence ramp-up design and\nperformance that make this such a challenging area to address. The prototype modelling\ntool presented in this paper was developed from an understanding of the relationships\nbetween the influencing factors rather than treating them independently. The result is\ngreater insight into ramp-up performance whilst respecting key constraints that exist in\ncapacity, learning and costs.\n[Revision increased 5500 words to 6550 words excluding tables and references]\nREFERENCES\n1 Haller, M., Peikert, A. and Thoma, J.
