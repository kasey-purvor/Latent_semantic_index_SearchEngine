We present SuperDARN radar observations of the\nionospheric flow during a well-observed high-latitude sub-\nstorm which occurred during steady northward IMF condi-\ntions on 2 December 1999. These data clearly demonstrate\nthe excitation of large-scale flow associated with the sub-\nstorm expansion phase, with enhanced equatorward flows be-\ning observed in the pre-midnight local time sector of the ex-\npansion phase auroral bulge and westward electrojet, and en-\nhanced return sunward flows being present at local times on\neither side, extending into the dayside sector. The flow pat-\ntern excited was thus of twin-vortex form, with foci located\nat either end of the substorm auroral bulge, as imaged by the\nPolar VIS UV imager. Estimated total transpolar voltages\nwere\u223c40 kV prior to expansion phase onset, grew to\u223c80 kV\nover a\u223c15 min interval during the expansion phase, and then\ndecayed to \u223c35 kV over \u223c10 min during recovery. The exci-\ntation of the large-scale flow pattern resulted in the develop-\nment of magnetic disturbances which extended well outside\nof the region directly disturbed by the substorm, depending\nupon the change in the flow and the local ionospheric con-\nductivity. It is estimated that the nightside reconnection rate\naveraged over the 24-min interval of the substorm was \u223c65\u2013\n75 kV, compared with continuing dayside reconnection rates\nof \u223c30\u201345 kV. The net closure of open flux during the sub-\nstorm was thus \u223c0.4\u20130.6\u00d7108 Wb, representing \u223c15\u201320%\nof the open flux present at onset, and corresponding to an\noverall contraction of the open-closed field line boundary by\n\u223c1\u25e6 latitude.\nKey words. Ionosphere (auroral ionosphere; ionosphere-\nmagnetosphere interactions; plasma convection)\n1 Introduction\nAccording to the theoretical picture proposed by Cowley and\nLockwood (1992), Dungey-cycle flow in the Earth\u2019s coupled\nsolar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere system may be con-\nCorrespondence to: A. Grocott (ag27@ion.le.ac.uk)\nsidered to be excited principally by two essentially indepen-\ndent processes. The first is reconnection at the magnetopause\nbetween the Earth\u2019s field and the interplanetary field in the\nmagnetosheath, which results in the transfer of newly-formed\nopen flux tubes from the dayside into the tail lobes. This pro-\ncess causes a departure of the system from equilibrium, and\nexcites flow which carries the system towards a new equi-\nlibrium configuration with the changed (increased) amount\nof open flux. In the ionosphere, the flow is of twin-vortex\nform, with antisunward flow over the polar cap and return\nsunward flow at lower latitudes. The flow is expected to be\nstrongest on the dayside, with the foci of the twin-vortex flow\nlocated at either end of the dayside merging gap, and is as-\nsociated with an expansion in size of the open polar cap and\nsurrounding auroral zone.\nThe second process is the reconnection of open tail lobe\nflux across the tail current sheet, which results in the destruc-\ntion of open lobe flux, and the contraction of newly-formed\nclosed flux tubes towards the Earth. This process similarly\nperturbs the system from equilibrium, and also excites flow\nwhich is of twin-vortex form in the ionosphere. Now, how-\never, the flow will be strongest on the nightside, with the foci\nof the twin-vortex flow located at either end of the nightside\nmerging gap, and is associated with a contraction of the open\npolar cap and surrounding auroral zone. This two-component\nflow picture, while first being presented in the above form by\nCowley and Lockwood (1992), is related to earlier ideas on\nboundary motions and flows presented by Siscoe and Huang\n(1985) and Freeman and Southwood (1988). Further discus-\nsion may be found in the more recent papers by Cowley and\nLockwood (1996) and Cowley (1998).\nThe excitation of flow in the dayside ionosphere during\nintervals of southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF)\nand consequent magnetopause reconnection is now a well-\nestablished phenomenon (e.g. Etemadi et al., 1988; Todd et\nal., 1988; Ruohoniemi et al., 1993; Ridley et al., 1998; Khan\nand Cowley, 1999). Even the substructure of characteristi-\ncally pulsed dayside reconnection on 5\u201310 min time scales\n(i.e. flux transfer events) are well-resolved in dayside flow\n1578 A. Grocott et al.: Excitation of ionospheric flow during substorms\ndata as pulsed ionospheric flows (Lockwood et al., 1989,\n1993; Elphic et al., 1990; Pinnock et al., 1993, 1995; Moen\net al., 1995; Provan et al., 1998; Neudegg et al., 1999, 2000;\nMilan et al., 2000; Wild et al., 2001). As a consequence,\nthere is now little uncertainty about the central role of magne-\ntopause reconnection in magnetospheric dynamics and flow\nexcitation.\nThe same cannot be said, however, of the correspond-\ning relationship between tail reconnection and flow, which\nhas recently been discussed in more detail by Cowley et al.\n(1998) and Lu et al. (2001). Two distinct phenomena have\nbeen linked to tail reconnection. The first of these relates\nto azimuthally-localized impulsive events in which auroras\nare first intensified at the poleward boundary of the night-\nside auroral zone, and then expand equatorward, reaching to\nnear the equatorward boundary of the oval emissions after\n\u223c5 min (Henderson et al., 1998). These events, termed pole-\nward boundary intensifications (PBIs) by Lyons et al. (1999),\nhave been found to occur in all phases of the substorm cy-\ncle, including during long intervals of magnetic quiet, though\nthey appear to be more frequent during substorm expan-\nsion phases. They are associated with azimuthally-localized\nbursty bulk flows (BBFs) in the near-Earth plasma sheet\n(Baumjohann et al., 1990; Angelopoulos et al., 1992; Yeo-\nman et al., 1998; Lyons et al., 1999) and the excitation of\nequatorward flow in the ionosphere (Sergeev et al., 1990; de\nla Beaujardire et al., 1994; Yeoman and Lu\u00a8hr, 1997; Watan-\nabe et al., 1998), together with relatively weak structured\nmagnetic disturbances in the high-latitude ionosphere, Pi2\nsignals, and particle injections at geosynchronous orbit (Hsu\nand McPherron, 1996; Henderson et al., 1998; Lyons et al.,\n1999; Sergeev et al., 1999, 2000). As discussed, for example,\nby Cowley (1998), and Cowley et al. (1998), these features\nare strongly suggestive of the occurrence of localized impul-\nsive reconnection in the tail leading to plasma injection and\nflow excitation. During quiet times, at least, the reconnection\nsite is presumed to be that lying in the more distant magne-\ntotail beyond \u223c100 RE.\nWhile PBI\/BBF events thus probably represent the con-\nsequences of localized impulsive reconnection in the tail,\nwhich can occur under a wide variety of conditions, it has\nlong been supposed that major episodes of tail reconnec-\ntion and open flux destruction take place during magneto-\nspheric substorms (Hones, 1979; Baker et al., 1996). Con-\ntroversy still surrounds the sequence of events which oc-\ncur during the few-minute phase which initiates substorm\nexpansion, with some observations suggesting that tail re-\nconnection is initiated by near-Earth current sheet disrup-\ntion followed by tailward-propagating inward collapse of the\nfield lines (e.g. Lui, 1991, 1996; Frank and Sigwarth, 2000;\nFriedrich et al., 2001). Nevertheless, recent results from the\nGeotail spacecraft do show that reconnection typically be-\ngins in the dusk sector plasma sheet at down-tail distances\nof \u223c20\u201330 RE, a few minutes before the onset of expansion\nsignatures on the ground, and then expands to encompass a\nsignificant fraction of the dusk and midnight sector tail (Na-\ngai et al., 1998; Nagai and Machida, 1998; Petrukovich et\nal., 1998; Machida et al., 1999). Both initial dipolarization\nand the convection that results from tail reconnection con-\ntribute to substorm-associated Dungey-cycle flux transport in\nthe tail. This being so, we would expect that significant large-\nscale twin-vortex flows should be excited during substorms,\nwith the reconnection-associated transport presumably dom-\ninating on longer expansion phase time scales (few tens\nof minutes), corresponding in essence to the reconnection-\nassociated flows observed on the dayside cited above.\nObservational evidence for such flow excitation, however,\nhas at best been ambiguous. In a recent study of Sondre-\nstrom radar data, Blanchard et al. (1997) (following earlier\nwork by de la Beaujardie`re et al., 1991 and Blanchard et\nal., 1996) measured the local reconnection rate by examin-\ning the ionospheric flow across the open-closed field line\nboundary, the position of the latter being estimated from\nionospheric features observed by the radar and 630 nm au-\nroral emission. They found that an increase in the recon-\nnection rate occurs near midnight, shortly after expansion\nphase onset, expanding to encompass a wider local time sec-\ntor after \u223c20 min. However, the initial reconnection rate in-\ncrease was manifest mainly in a poleward motion of the in-\nferred open-closed field line boundary. Flows were found to\nbecome elevated only after an interval of \u223c30 min. Some-\nwhat correspondingly, Weimer (1999) has presented a sta-\ntistical survey of low-altitude electric field data from the\nDE-2 spacecraft, separated according to the IMF direction\nand into substorm and non-substorm intervals. The flow pat-\nterns for a given IMF orientation show a more pronounced\nHarang asymmetry on the nightside during substorm inter-\nvals than during non-substorm intervals, but the total trans-\npolar voltage values showed little overall difference. On the\nother hand, Opgenoorth and Pellinen (1998), following ear-\nlier work by Grafe et al. (1987), have presented evidence for\nflow enhancements in the dusk auroral zone immediately fol-\nlowing expansion phase onset in the midnight sector, leading\nto an immediate increase in the global directly driven cur-\nrent system. They suggest, however, that diversion of the\ntwin-vortex flow around the low-flow high-conductivity au-\nroral bulge formed during the expansion phase (e.g. Kirk-\nwood et al., 1988; Morelli et al., 1995; Yeoman et al., 2000;\nKhan et al., 2001) may play a role. Fox et al. (1999) have\nalso reported observations of a surge of transpolar flow into\nthe midnight sector associated with a substorm intensifica-\ntion, which they suggest was due to a burst of reconnection\nin the tail. Most recently, Grocott et al. (2000) have pre-\nsented an analysis of SuperDARN radar flow data obtained\nduring an isolated substorm, and have found evidence for the\nexcitation of twin-vortex flow cells centered in the nightside\nionosphere, which enhance the transpolar voltage by\u223c20 kV\ncompared with pre-onset values.\nGiven these somewhat varied conclusions, taken together\nwith rather clear theoretical expectations, further study of\nthe important issue of large-scale ionospheric flow excita-\ntion during substorms is clearly warranted. The international\nSuperDARN HF radar network employed by Grocott et al.\n(2000), which is now able to image the ionospheric flow over\nA. Grocott et al.: Excitation of ionospheric flow during substorms 1579\na large fraction of the polar regions with good time resolution\n(Greenwald et al., 1995; Shepherd and Ruohoniemi, 2000) is\nclearly the most suitable tool to undertake this task. Never-\ntheless, the intervention of several factors introduces signif-\nicant difficulties into this undertaking. The first is that sub-\nstorm intervals are usually associated with periods of large\nand variable negative IMF Bz, which will result in large\nvariations of the ionospheric flow through modulated mag-\nnetopause reconnection. These variations may be expected\nto be at least as large as those associated with nightside re-\nconnection and substorms, such that the flow variations as-\nsociated with the substorms may be obscured. Second, sub-\nstorms are generally initiated in the ionosphere on field lines\nmapping to \u223c65\u25e6. This latitude is close to the equatorward\nedge of the SuperDARN field of view (in normal scan mode),\nso that the substorm-effected region may only be partially\nimaged. Third, it is very often the case that SuperDARN\nradar backscatter drops out during intervals of magnetic dis-\nturbance due to precipitation-induced D-region radio absorp-\ntion (Milan et al., 1996; Yeoman and Lu\u00a8hr, 1997). In this\ncase the evolution of the flow during the substorm cannot be\nproperly followed after the onset of the expansion phase.\nIn this paper we study the flows which occurred during an\nisolated substorm on 2 December 1999 under somewhat for-\ntuitous circumstances, such that the above difficulties were\nlargely circumvented. First, the substorm occurred during\nan interval of very steady northward IMF (and large nega-\ntive By), such that the flows driven from the dayside may\nbe expected to have been steady in character and modest\nin magnitude. Second, due to these overall relatively quiet\nconditions, the substorm occurred at higher latitudes than\nusual, with the electrojet centered near \u223c70\u25e6, and was thus\nlocated well within the region of usual SuperDARN cover-\nage. Furthermore, the substorm occurred in the pre-midnight\nsector centrally within the region viewed by the six North-\nern Hemisphere radars operating at that time, so that the\nflows both within the substorm-disturbed region, and in the\nregions both to its east and west, were well monitored during\nthe disturbance. Third, backscatter was observed throughout\nthe interval essentially across the full range of local times\ncovered by the radars (though still dropping out within part\nof the substorm bulge region itself), so that good estimates\ncould be made of the overall voltage associated with the\nflow. This was probably due to the high-latitude nature of the\nsubstorm, such that the enhanced D-region lay poleward of\nwhere the HF radar beams traversed that layer of the iono-\nsphere. These observations demonstrate unequivocally an\nexcitation of twin-vortex flow associated with the substorm\nexpansion phase, with enhanced equatorward flows occur-\nring in the local time sector of the bulge, and enhanced re-\nturn sunward flows being present at earlier and later local\ntimes. We find that the transpolar voltage increased in the\nexpansion phase from \u223c40 kV, during the pre-onset interval\nto peak at \u223c80 kV after \u223c15 min, and then died away over\n\u223c10 min during the recovery phase to \u223c35 kV.\n2 Instrumentation\nIn this section we provide brief details of the instrumenta-\ntion employed in this study, which principally concerns the\ninterval 00:20\u201301:40 UT on 2 December 1999.\n2.1 SuperDARN radar data\nThe central focus of our study is the measurement of iono-\nspheric convection velocities provided by the Super Dual Au-\nroral Radar Network (SuperDARN). SuperDARN is an in-\nternational array of HF coherent radars spanning the auro-\nral regions of both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres\n(Greenwald et al., 1995). At the time of the interval de-\nscribed here, the Northern Hemisphere network consisted of\nsix radars, whose fields of view covered approximately 12 h\nof magnetic local time (MLT). This is illustrated in Fig. 1a,\nwhere we show a view looking onto the northern magnetic\npole. With increasing MLT we show the fields of view of\nthe Saskatoon (T), Kapuskasing (K), Goose Bay (G), Iceland\nWest (W), Iceland East (E), and Finland (F) radars. These\nare shown on a geomagnetic grid at 01:00 UT (a central time\nduring the study, corresponding to maximum magnetic\/flow\ndisturbance during the substorm), extending from the pole\nto 60\u25e6 latitude, with noon at the top and dusk to the left.\nThe coordinates are Altitude Adjusted Corrected Geomag-\nnetic (AACGM) coordinates, a development of the PACE\nsystem discussed by Baker and Wing (1989). The fields-\nof-view of the three radars whose data will be displayed in\ndetail are shaded blue, with data being displayed from the\nbeam directions marked by the red lines.\nAll six radars were operating in a standard mode during the\nstudy interval, in which each radar scans through 16 beams of\nazimuthal separation 3.24\u25e6, with a total scan time of 2 min.\nEach beam is divided into 75 range gates of length 45 km,\nand so in each full scan the radar covers 52\u25e6 in azimuth and\nover 3000 km in range. Large-scale maps of the high-latitude\nconvection have been derived from this data using the Map-\nPotential model developed by Ruohoniemi and Baker (1998).\nIn this model, the line-of-sight velocities are mapped onto a\npolar grid, and used to determine a solution for the electro-\nstatic potential, which is expressed in spherical harmonics.\nThe equipotentials of the solution then represent the plasma\nstreamlines of the modelled convection pattern. Informa-\ntion from the statistical model of Ruohoniemi and Greenwald\n(1996), parameterized by concurrent IMF conditions, is used\nto stabilize the solution where no measurements are avail-\nable. In this paper, spherical harmonic fits using terms up\nto sixth order are employed to fit the radar data, as deemed\nappropriate from the good overall coverage of the data.\n2.2 Ground magnetometer data\nIn Fig. 1b we show the locations of the ground magnetic sta-\ntions employed, on the same magnetic grid at 01:00 UT as\nin Fig. 1a. Measurements are provided by magnetometers\nfrom six Northern Hemisphere arrays which span the same\n1580 A.

Red dots indicate\nstations which form a longitude chain\nat \u223c70\u25e6\u201375\u25e6, which define the local\ntime extent of the principal magnetic\ndisturbance. Blue dots indicate sta-\ntions of the Greenland west coast lati-\ntude chain (additional to GHB and NAQ\nwhich are coloured red and green as\njust indicated), which define the latitu-\ndinal extent of the main magnetic dis-\nturbance. The black oval represents the\nionospheric footprint of geostationary\norbit (specifically that of the GOES-8\nspacecraft).

These are the Cana-\ndian CANOPUS array (Grant et al., 1992), the Geological\nSurvey of Canada array, the MACCS array (Hughes and En-\ngebretson, 1997), the Greenland Magnetometer Chain (Friis-\nChristensen et al., 1985), the Scandinavian IMAGE array\n(Lu\u00a8hr et al., 1998), and the SAMNET array (Yeoman et al.,\n1990). Time-series data from all six chains will be presented\nin H,D,Z coordinates, where H is local magnetic north, D\nis local magnetic east, and Z is vertically down.\nThe identifier codes of specific magnetometer stations\nwhich are of particular interest are also indicated in the fig-\nure. Data from those at lower latitudes, colour-coded green\n(i.e. PBQ, NAQ, and FAR), have been band-pass filtered (20\u2013\n200 s) to provide information on Pi2 signals. Those at lati-\ntudes \u223c70\u25e6\u201375\u25e6 , colour-coded red (i.e. CHX, IQA, GHB,\nAMK, SCO, and BJN), define the local time extent of the\nprincipal magnetic disturbances during the substorm, span-\nning \u223c8 h of MLT from post-dusk, through midnight, to pre-\nA. Grocott et al.: Excitation of ionospheric flow during substorms 1581\ndawn. In addition, we will show data from the Greenland\nwest coast latitudinal chain STF, SKT, GHB, FHB, and NAQ,\nof which GHB and NAQ are colour-coded red and green as\njust indicated, while the remainder are colour-coded blue.\nThis chain spans the substorm electrojet between \u223c66\u25e6 and\n\u223c74\u25e6 magnetic latitude.\n2.3 Geostationary spacecraft data\nThe coloured triangles in Fig. 1b show the ionospheric foot-\nprints at 01:00 UT of three geostationary spacecraft, whose\ndata are employed in this study to verify the occurrence of\nnormal substorm phenomena. These have been mapped from\ngeostationary orbit using the T-89 model for Kp = 2 (Tsyga-\nnenko, 1989). This is the Kp value prevailing during the in-\nterval 00:00\u201303:00 UT. The blue triangle shows the footprint\nof GOES-8, located (at \u223c01:00 UT) in the pre-midnight sec-\ntor just to the west (and equatorward of) the main substorm\ndisturbed region. The black solid line shows the mapped or-\nbit of this spacecraft. Magnetometer data from GOES-8 will\nbe used to characterize the nightside geostationary magnetic\nfield during the interval (Singer et al., 1996). The red tri-\nangles show the positions of Los Alamos National Labora-\ntory spacecraft LANL-97A and 1994\u2013084. The SOPA in-\nstruments carried by each spacecraft provide high-resolution\nenergetic particle measurements (Belian et al., 1992). Here\nwe will use these data to examine the injection of energetic\nions and electrons into geostationary orbit during the sub-\nstorm.\n2.4 Polar auroral images\nImages of the aurora were provided during the interval by\nthe VIS imager on the Polar spacecraft (Frank et al., 1995).\nThis instrument viewed the whole of the northern polar iono-\nsphere during the course of the substorm, and provided im-\nages approximately every 5 min. These consist of 32.5 s in-\ntegrations of UV photons at a wavelength of 130.4 nm.\n2.5 Upstream interplanetary parameters\nInterplanetary conditions were monitored by the ACE space-\ncraft (Stone et al., 1998), located upstream of the Earth at\nGSM coordinates (X, Y,Z) = (+221,+21,\u221225)RE . The\nvariation of the spacecraft position over the interval was not\nsignificant. Solar wind and IMF data were obtained by the\nSWEPAM and MAG instruments, respectively (McComas et\nal., 1998; Smith et al., 1999). The propagation delay of field\nchanges from ACE to the dayside ionosphere has been esti-\nmated using the method of Khan and Cowley (1999). The\nestimate includes the propagation time in the solar wind up-\nstream of the bow shock, the frozen-in transit time across the\nsubsolar magnetosheath, and the Alfve\u00b4nic propagation time\nalong open field lines from the subsolar magnetopause to the\nionosphere. With solar wind densities \u223c12 cm\u22123 and speeds\n\u223c350 km\/s, we find a propagation delay of 74\u00b15 min, and\nthis time has been used to lag the ACE interplanetary data\ndisplayed here.\n3 Observations\nIn this section we discuss the ground and space observations\nmade during the substorm. We begin with an overview of\nthe interplanetary and geomagnetic conditions during an ex-\npanded interval surrounding the substorm, and subsequently\nlook in more detail at the magnetic, flow, and auroral data\nduring the substorm itself.\n3.1 Upstream interplanetary conditions\nFigure 2a presents data from the ACE spacecraft, lagged by\n74 min as described, during the 10-h interval from 19:00 UT\non 1 December to 05:00 UT on 2 December 1999. The\nvertical dashed lines on this and subsequent figures indi-\ncate the onset time of the substorm expansion at 00:44 UT,\nand the beginning of the recovery phase at 01:06 UT. De-\ntails of the determination of these times will be discussed in\nSect. 3.3. The top two panels show the solar wind proton\nnumber density (Np) and speed (Vp) from ACE\/SWEPAM\n(for which data were available only up to 03:30 UT lagged\ntime). During this interval the density varied between 5 and\n20 cm\u22123, and the velocity between 330 and 380 km\/s. How-\never, it is apparent that during the substorm interval both\nthe density and velocity were relatively steady at \u223c12 cm\u22123\nand \u223c350 km\/s, respectively. The bottom three panels illus-\ntrate the three components of the IMF in GSM coordinates\nfrom ACE\/MAG. Throughout most of the interval, Bx re-\nmained small and negative, typically 0 to \u22125 nT, while By\nwas large and negative, around \u221210 nT. Bz was also negative\nuntil \u223c20:50 UT (lagged time), thereafter remaining close to\nzero until \u223c00:10 UT. Between \u223c00:10 UT and \u223c02:15 UT,\nBz was consistently northward, and remained at a constant\n+5 nT during the substorm expansion phase. At \u223c02:15 UT\nit underwent a brief southward excursion, before returning\nnorthward for the remainder of the interval.\n3.2 Ground magnetic data overview\nFigure 2b presents H component measurements from the six\nground magnetometers which comprise the \u223c120\u25e6 longitu-\ndinal array coloured red in Fig. 1b. The vertical arrows in-\ndicate magnetic local midnight for each of the stations (mid-\nnight for CHX occurs at \u223c05:26 UT, just beyond the interval\ndisplayed). The horizontal dotted lines are baselines for the\nmagnetic disturbance observed at each station, the choice of\nwhich will be discussed in Sect. 3.6. An initial magnetic\ndisturbance starts just after 19:00 UT, coinciding with the in-\nterval of negative IMF Bz mentioned above. However, these\nperturbations start to decay simultaneously with the north-\nward turning of the IMF at \u223c20:50 UT, with all traces re-\nturning to near baseline by \u223c00:00 UT. Then, at \u223c00:44 UT\n(first dashed line) a sharp negative bay onset begins in the\nmidnight sector, with small negative precursory activity start-\ning at \u223c00:35 UT. A peak disturbance of \u2212275 nT was ob-\nserved at AMK at 00:55 UT. UV imagery to be shown be-\nlow demonstrate that the main auroral disturbance spanned\n1582 A.

Figure 2b demonstrates that\nmagnetic perturbations were also observed outside this re-\ngion, with weak negative disturbances peaking at \u221250 nT\nbeing observed at CHX at \u223c19:30 MLT, variable fields of\n\u223c75 nT amplitude at SCO at \u223c01:10 MLT, and positive per-\nturbations peaking at 125 nT at BJN at\u223c03:30 MLT. Thus, as\npreviously emphasized by Opgenoorth and Pellinen (1998),\nmagnetic disturbances occur during the expansion phase over\na broad range of MLT (greater than 8 h in this case), and\nare not confined to the range of local times occupied by the\nauroral bulge. These disturbances will be related below to\nchanges in the flow pattern that occur during the substorm.\nAn equally rapid bay recovery began at \u223c01:06 UT (second\nvertical dashed line). The main interval of disturbance was\nconcluded by \u223c01:20 UT, with more gradual variations to-\nwards baseline values occurring after that.\n3.3 Greenland west magnetic data\nWe now examine data from the substorm-disturbed region\nitself. In Fig. 3 we present magnetic measurements from\nthe meridional array of west coast Greenland magnetome-\nters (the blue array in Fig. 1b). These were located near\n23:00 MLT, and thus centrally within the substorm-disturbed\nregion at the time of substorm onset. We show data for\nan 80-min interval spanning the substorm, from 00:20 to\n01:40 UT on 2 December. The vertical dashed lines show\nthe times of onset of the expansion and recovery phases as in\nFig. 2. Panel (i) shows the H component at stations NAQ\nto STF, spanning magnetic latitudes from \u223c66\u25e6 to \u223c73\u25e6.\nThe largest negative disturbance occurred at GHB at \u223c71\u25e6,\nreaching \u223c \u2212225 nT at 00:55 UT.

The onset times of\nthe expansion and recovery phases, 00:44 UT and 01:06 UT,\nrespectively, have thus been based on the onset and decay of\nthe negative bay at GHB. Although the expansion onset time\nis similar at all stations within the electrojet region, GHB is\nthe last station to observe the start of the recovery phase. The\nlocation of the center of the disturbance is confirmed by the\nZ component data displayed in panel (iii), which show near-\nzero perturbations throughout the interval at station GHB,\nwith negative perturbations at FHB and NAQ in the equator-\nward region, and positive perturbations at SKT and STF in\nthe poleward region. The negative Z perturbations peak at\nstation FHB, while the positive perturbations peak at STF\n(and fall to smaller values at GDH at \u223c76\u25e6 and UMQ at\n\u223c77\u25e6, data not shown). These data thus suggest a westward\nelectrojet spanning \u223c68\u25e6\u201373\u25e6, centered near \u223c71\u25e6. The D\ncomponent data are shown in panel (ii). Relatively strong\nnegative perturbations observed at STF in the poleward re-\ngion decline with latitude at SKT and GHB, and reverse to\npositive at FHB and NAQ. These data suggest the presence\nof additional currents which are directed poleward at GHB,\nSKT, and SFT, and equatorward at FHB and NAQ.\n3.4 Other substorm indicators\nFigure 4 provides a plot of other parameters which give in-\nformation on the nature and timing of the disturbance. The\nfirst three panels show H component data from the lower-\nlatitude magnetometer stations (green in Fig. 1b) which have\nbeen band-pass filtered between 20\u2013200 s to exhibit signals\nin the Pi2 band. Station NAQ, which is directly equatorward\nof the main substorm-disturbed region, detects a large ampli-\ntude Pi2 starting at 00:44 UT, confirming our determination\nof the onset time of substorm expansion. To the east and\nwest, FAR and PBQ both see Pi2s of a smaller amplitude\nshortly afterwards, indicating the large-scale response to the\nsubstorm disturbance.\nThe lower panels of Fig. 4 show data from geostationary\nspacecraft. Panels four and five show energetic electron data\nfrom LANL-97A and 1994\u2013084, respectively. Both observe\nrelatively weak dispersed injection signatures 10\u201320 min af-\nter substorm onset, consistent with their dawn sector location\n(see Fig. 1b) (Reeves et al., 1991). No significant ion injec-\ntions were observed. The bottom three panels show GOES-8\nmagnetic field data in GSM coordinates. At the time of the\nsubstorm, GOES-8 was located at \u223c20:00 MLT, \u223c1 h MLT\nto the west of the disturbed region, as indicated in Fig. 1b.\nThe dashed curves show model magnetic field values derived\nfrom the T-89 Kp = 2 model (Tsyganenko, 1989). Both Bx\nand By components follow the model field closely, while Bz\ndisplays a clear increase in magnitude starting at 01:05 UT,\nwhich subsequently increases during the recovery phase to\nvalues well in excess of the model. This is likely due to the\nreturn of magnetic flux from the tail to the inner magneto-\nsphere as a consequence of the substorm.\n1584 A.

We mentioned in the Introduction that a reduction\nin backscatter coverage due to D-region absorption is a com-\nmon feature of the expansion phase. Fortunately, however,\nthe equatorward region of backscatter remained, and reveals\na remarkable change in the flow which developed in concert\nwith the substorm bay at GHB. Within \u223c4 min (two radar\ncycles) of the onset, the flow below \u223c73\u25e6 changed to be-\ncome strongly equatorward (deep blue and purple) with line-\nof-sight speeds in excess of \u223c1000 m\/s. These flows contin-\nued during the expansion phase until 01:06 UT, when, in con-\njunction with the start of the recovery phase, the backscat-\nter coverage became significantly reduced along the whole\nbeam. When partial coverage was resumed, at \u223c01:12 UT,\nthe line-of-sight flows were much reduced, and a flow rever-\nsal boundary was again present within the field-of-view after\n\u223c01:20 UT.\nRelated effects can be seen in the data from Goose Bay\nbeam 8, shown in the third panel of Fig. 5. Here the line-\nof-sight flow is equatorward along almost the whole beam\nprior to the beginning of the expansion phase. At onset, the\nbackscatter coverage is again reduced in the poleward region.\nIn the equatorward region, the line-of-sight flow intensified\nover the initial \u223c6 min as the bay developed at GHB, and\nreached \u223c1000 m\/s after \u223c00:54 UT. In this case, however,\nA.

In the top right-hand corner we indicate the flow model\nemployed to stabilize the potential solution in regions where no data are available, obtained from the statistical study of Ruohoniemi and\nGreenwald (1996).\nrecovery saw an expansion in the region of backscatter, such\nthat the changes in flow can be followed more fully. The flow\nremained equatorward along most of the beam, and showed\na rapid reduction to smaller values in approximate concert\nwith the decline in the bay amplitude.\nTurning to the data from Kapuskasing beam 8, located in\nthe dusk sector (Fig. 1a) and shown in panel four, it can be\nseen that prior to onset, the line-of-sight flow below \u223c75\u25e6\nis poleward, away from the radar, becoming weaker and di-\nrected towards the radar at higher latitudes. Referring to\nFig. 1a, it seems evident that these flows relate to the sun-\nward and poleward flows of the normal twin-cell pattern in\nthe dusk sector below \u223c75\u25e6, and to the flow-reversal bound-\nary and polar cap at higher latitudes. After expansion on-\nset a similar pattern remained, but with the flow gradually\nstrengthening over \u223c10 min as the substorm developed. It\nthen declined again over \u223c10 min after the onset of recov-\nery. Thus, flow effects are also observed in the dusk sector\noutside the immediate vicinity of the substorm-disturbed re-\ngion, which we infer to be associated with an enhancement\nof the twin-cell pattern. It is also notable that no drop-out\nin backscatter was observed in this sector, but was rather en-\nhanced in this case. Similar comments apply to the dawn\nsector data from Finland beam 8 (see Fig. 1a), shown in\nthe bottom panel. Here flows are initially weak. However,\nthe expanded coverage available during the expansion phase\nshows the development of a strong poleward flow away from\nthe radar above \u223c75\u25e6 after \u223c00:54 UT, which declined over\n\u223c10 min during recovery. We will show below that this flow\nwas also connected to the return flow of a twin-vortex pattern\n1586 A.

Each map corresponds to\none 2-min radar experiment cycle time, and alternate maps\nare shown over the interval 00:32\u201301:18 UT spanning the\nsubstorm. These are grouped into three sets of four maps\neach, which correspond to the pre-onset interval, the expan-\nsion phase, and recovery. Figure 6a thus displays the con-\nvection patterns observed between 00:32 and 00:46 UT, cor-\nresponding to the time leading up to and spanning the sub-\nstorm expansion phase onset at 00:44 UT. During this inter-\nval, and for some \u223c20 min prior to it, the IMF had been di-\nrected consistently northward, with a larger negativeBy com-\nponent (see Fig. 2a and the icon at the bottom right-hand cor-\nner of the flow maps). A reasonably steady and well-defined\ntwin-vortex flow was present during the interval, with a de-\nrived transpolar voltage VPC of \u223c40 kV (given in the bot-\ntom left-hand corner of each plot). Since backscatter was\npresent nearly continuously between the extrema in the volt-\nage values (as can be seen from the coverage of the plotted\nvectors), these voltages probably represent good estimates\nof the true values. Asymmetries in the flow pattern are ev-\nident during the interval, most probably associated with the\nnegative IMF By conditions prevailing. Examination of the\nwhole data set after\u223c00:10 UT shows that the polar flow was\nstronger at dawn than at dusk within the more central polar\ncap, the flow then generally swinging dawnward as the auro-\nral zone is approached on the nightside, and then duskward\nA.

We will\nshow below that this zone corresponds to the brightest region\nof auroral enhancement during the substorm. Towards dawn\nand dusk, growing return flows are also seen, associated with\nthe line-of-sight velocity enhancements observed by the Ka-\npuskasing and Finland radars noted above.

The overall\ntranspolar voltage associated with the flow grew from 37 kV\nat onset to peak at 80 kV at 01:00 UT. The excited flows ex-\ntend into the dawn-dusk and dayside sector, where the flow\nreversal boundary also appears to undergo a small simulta-\nneous latitudinal contraction. On the dusk meridian, for ex-\nample, where the boundary is relatively well-defined, a pole-\nward displacement of \u223c1\u25e6 is evident in Fig. 6b. This motion\nwill be investigated further in Sect. 3.7.\nFigure 6c shows the transition to the recovery phase, be-\ntween 01:04 and 01:18 UT. In the first map, 01:04\u201301:06 UT,\nthe equatorward flows in the pre-midnight sector had already\ndecreased significantly, with VPC correspondingly reducing\nto 57 kV. Over the next \u223c10 min, the flows continued to di-\nminish rapidly, and while remaining essentially similar to\nthose occurring before the substorm, the flows became more\nstructured and variable.\n3.6 VIS UV Earth camera auroral images and magnetic dis-\nturbance vectors\nIn this section we now examine how the flows described\nabove relate to the substorm aurora, and to the magnetic\ndisturbance, in so far as the latter can be determined from\nthe ground station coverage. Figure 7 shows auroral images\nobtained by the VIS Earth camera, on which SuperDARN\nflow vectors and Map-Potential streamlines have been super-\nposed (black), together with pseudo-flow vectors obtained\nfrom ground magnetic observations (red). Each UV image\ncorresponds to a 32.5-s integration, and we show each of the\nimages obtained, at intervals of \u223c5 min, spanning the sub-\nstorm. The SuperDARN map corresponds to the 2-min in-\nterval into which the center time of the UV image falls. The\nmagnetic data have been averaged over the same 2-min inter-\nvals as the SuperDARN scans, and thus correspond similarly\nto the UV image.\nIn deriving the magnetic vectors, we have assumed that\nthe perturbations are due to overhead Hall currents, and have\nthus rotated them anti-clockwise through 90\u25e6 to point in the\ndirection of the inferred flow. If this assumption is valid, the\nvectors should be aligned with the radar vectors, with the\nratio of their lengths being determined by the local height-\nintegrated Hall conductivity. For the scales chosen in the\nfigure, the two vectors would have equal length for a height-\nintegrated conductivity of \u223c1.6 mho (no correction having\nbeen made for ground induction effects). In order to obtain\nuseful results, baseline values have to be chosen carefully\nfor each magnetometer station. Examination of the records\nindicates that after the substorm, the magnetosphere returned\nto a quiet state during an extended interval of northward IMF\n(see Fig. 2a). Those stations for which a quiet-time baseline\nis routinely determined (e.g. the Greenland chain) were all\nfound to have returned close to that baseline by \u223c04:00 UT.\nConsequently, for simplicity and consistency we have chosen\nthe baseline for all stations as the field measured at 04:00 UT.\nThis is the baseline used in all plots of unfiltered magnetic\ndata displayed in this paper.\nFigure 7a begins by showing two UV images correspond-\ning to the interval before expansion phase onset, centered\nat 00:33:16 and 00:37:47 UT. The UV auroras form an es-\nsentially continuous band circling the pole, reaching \u223c70\u25e6\non the nightside and \u223c80\u25e6 on the dayside, and being wider\nand reaching to higher latitudes at dawn compared with dusk.\nThe latter asymmetry is likely to be associated with the neg-\native IMF By conditions prevailing. Peak emission intensi-\nties are \u223c5 kR, near to midnight. Comparison with the flow\nvectors shows that in the region of SuperDARN radar cov-\nerage, the auroras lie in a region of westward flow located\nequatorward of the flow reversal boundary. Due to the (IMF\nBy-related) asymmetry in the flow pattern, this statement ap-\nplies continuously from the afternoon sector at\u223c15:00 MLT,\nthrough dusk and midnight, to the post-midnight sector at\n\u223c04:00 MLT. Throughout this sector, the poleward boundary\nof the auroras lies \u223c1\u25e6\u20132\u25e6 equatorward of the flow reversal\nboundary, the latter being a reasonable initial proxy for the\nopen-closed field line boundary. It is also notable that while\nsubstantial equatorward-directed flow is clearly present on\nthe nightside during the pre-onset interval, the locations of\nneither the flow reversal boundary nor the auroras change\nsignificantly. If we take the pre-midnight sector, for example,\nthe equatorward flow at \u223c70\u25e6 latitude (near the flow reversal\nand auroral boundaries) is typically\u223c300 m\/s. At this speed,\nthe boundaries would move equatorward by \u223c5\u25e6 of latitude\nin the\u223c30 min prior to substorm onset if they moved with the\nflow (i.e. if the boundaries were adiaroic). This clearly is not\nthe case. Examination of the data from the beginning of the\nday shows that the boundaries move less than\u223c1\u25e6 during this\ninterval. Consequently, we conclude that the plasma flows\nthrough essentially steady-state nightside boundaries during\nthis period. We thus infer that essentially steady nightside\nreconnection was in progress at a rate of \u223c40 kV during the\npre-onset period, presumably driven by continuous dayside\nreconnection with theBy-dominated IMF. This situation con-\ntrasts with the usual growth phase scenario in which the polar\ncap and auroral zone expand prior to expansion phase onset,\nas a consequence of unbalanced magnetopause reconnection\n(McPherron, 1970). Examination of the pseudo-flow mag-\nnetic vectors in Fig. 7a shows that they are quite small, but\nnevertheless often in reasonable agreement with the direc-\ntion of the SuperDARN flows (though counter-examples are\nalso evident). Comparison of the lengths of the vectors in the\nauroral region suggests Hall conductivities of \u223c1\u20132 mho.\nFigure 7b similarly displays two images which span the\nonset of the expansion phase at 00:44 UT, these being cen-\ntered at 00:43:41 and 00:48:12 UT, respectively. Compar-\ning these with Fig. 7a shows that the aurora has brightened\nin the midnight sector to \u223c15 kR and then to \u223c25 kR, and\nhas also expanded poleward by \u223c3\u25e6 to form a well-defined\nsubstorm bulge in the local time sector between \u223c20:00 and\n\u223c01:00 MLT. The bulge thus sat directly between the foci\nof the developing nightside twin-vortex flow pattern, though\nthe development of the latter in the morning sector was some-\nA.

The rapid\npoleward motion of the auroras, taking place in concert with\nstrong and increasing equatorward flow, argues for the oc-\ncurrence of rapid tail reconnection during this interval. An-\nother feature of note is the zone of flow avoidance mentioned\nabove, which developed in the flow pattern at \u223c00:48 UT,\nand was centered near \u223c70\u25e6 in the immediate pre-midnight\nsector. This zone clearly relates to the blob of brightest auro-\nral emission which lay between\u223c65\u25e6 and\u223c70\u25e6 in this sector.\nWe infer that the flow was diverted around this region due to\nthe high electrical conductivity resulting from the precipita-\ntion. Similar effects have been found in previous studies by\nKirkwood et al. (1988), Morelli et al. (1995), Yeoman et al.\n(2000), and Khan et al. (2001). Looking now at the magnetic\nobservations, and identifying the west coast Greenland sta-\ntions which lie within the meridian of the substorm bulge (see\nFig. 1b), it can be seen that the peak disturbance occurred (at\nstation GHB) in the weak-flow region at the poleward border\nof the auroral emission. The relative lengths of the magnetic\nand flow vectors in this region indicate Hall conductivities of\n\u223c10\u201320 mho. It can also be seen from the magnetic vectors\nthat the westward electrojet spanned \u223c70\u25e6\u201373\u25e6 at this time\n(stations GHB to STF on the Greenland west coast chain, see\nFig. 3a), and thus spanned, and extended poleward of, the\npoleward border of the UV emission. Significant magnetic\neffects were also observed at station IQA lying just pole-\nward of the emission at \u223c21:00 MLT (see Figs. 1b and 2b).\nNo magnetic vectors are shown directly within the blob of\nstrongest UV emission. The only station lying directly within\nthis region was Greenland east station AMK (see Fig. 1b),\nwhich observed the largest negative H perturbation globally\nduring the substorm, as previously shown in Fig. 2b. Unfor-\ntunately, however, the total horizontal disturbance at AMK\ncannot be shown because the D component is unavailable\n1590 A.

Here we see that the\nsubstorm auroral bulge had also reached its maximal extent,\nwith the westward electrojet continuing to span and extend\npoleward of its poleward boundary. Unfortunately there are\nnow no radar flow vectors within the electrojet region that\ncan be compared with the magnetic vectors, and from which\nconductivity estimates can be made. The flow excited during\nthe substorm is well-established, with VPC \u223c70 kV. Within\nthe bulge, the zone of avoidance near midnight is still evi-\ndent. Outside the bulge, the enhanced return flows are seen\nto extend via dusk and dawn into the dayside Hemisphere.\nAssociated magnetic disturbances of modest amplitude are\nthus produced in the surrounding regions where the conduc-\ntivity is sufficient to produce a measurable effect.\nFigure 7d shows images, centered at 01:04:32 and\n01:09:02 UT, which span the start of the substorm recovery\nphase at \u223c01:06 UT. During this interval the peak auroral\nintensities within the bulge had diminished significantly to\n\u223c5 kR, similar to values occurring before onset. However,\na comparison of the spatial distribution of the aurora with\nthat shown in Fig. 7a shows that a small general poleward\ndisplacement of the poleward border of the aurora had oc-\ncurred, by \u223c1\u25e6\u20132\u25e6, even on the dayside. This displacement\nmirrors the\u223c1\u25e6 poleward motion of the flow reversal bound-\nary at dusk noted above. The magnetic disturbance produced\nby the westward electrojet at the poleward border was still\nlarge, but diminishing, while the magnetic disturbance in the\ndawn sector had grown to become comparable in intensity.\nThe transpolar voltage associated with the flow also dimin-\nished over this interval to pre-onset values.\nFigure 7e finally shows two recovery phase images, cen-\nA.

Here the intensity of the\nbulge had diminished still further, as had the currents and\nflows. Nonetheless, equatorward flow persisted across the\npoleward boundary of the auroras in the pre-midnight sector,\nsuggestive of continuing reconnection in the pre-midnight\ntail. The transpolar voltage values were typically \u223c35 kV,\na little less than those occurring before the substorm.\n3.7 Summary of observations\nFigure 8 presents a summary of our main observations, from\nwhich we draw the simple, yet unequivocal conclusion that\ntwin-vortex flow was excited in the nightside high-latitude\nionosphere by an isolated substorm. The top three panels\nremind us of the nature of the IMF (lagged by 74 min) dur-\ning the substorm, with Bx small and negative, By large and\nnegative, and Bz intermediate in strength and positive. Such\ninterplanetary conditions would be expected to result in mod-\nest steady convection velocities in the ionosphere, resulting\nfrom reconnection with theBy-dominated IMF. In fact, under\nthese conditions, the Ruohoniemi and Greenwald (1996) sta-\ntistical model predicts a transpolar voltage of 33 kV. Flows\nassociated with transpolar voltages up to \u223c80 kV, as ob-\nserved, cannot reasonably be accounted for on this basis.\nIn addition, there are no indications in the dayside auroral\ndata of major magnetopause dynamics during the interval.\nThe fourth and fifth panel summarises the ground magnetic\ndata, emphasising that the disturbance studied has the typ-\nical characteristics of an isolated substorm of modest dura-\ntion and amplitude. Overall, the bay lasted for \u223c25 min, had\na peak amplitude of \u223c250 nT in the H component, and was\npreceded by a well-defined Pi2 signal. Weak energetic parti-\ncle injections and field strength increases were also observed\nat geostationary orbit, as shown above. The sixth panel in\nFig. 8 shows the total transpolar voltage. It seems obvious\n1592 A.

Finally, the seventh panel shows the latitude of\nthe flow reversal boundary on the dusk meridian, where it is\nwell-defined, determined from the minimum in the voltage of\nthe Map-Potential fit. Since the solution for the potential is\nobtained on a discrete latitudinal grid of 1\u25e6 resolution, these\ndata are rather marginal for the present purpose. However, as\nindicated above, they suggest that a small poleward displace-\nment of the boundary took place during the substorm. Av-\neraged over the \u223c20-min intervals before and after the sub-\nstorm, indicated by the horizontal dashed lines, the boundary\nmoved from \u223c77\u25e6 before to \u223c78\u25e6 after, i.e. a displacement\nof \u223c1\u25e6. The poleward motion of the flow reversal bound-\nary is also evident in the line-of-sight data from beam 8 of\nthe Kapuskasing radar shown in Fig. 5, panel four, although\nthe latitude of the boundary is somewhat lower due to the\nlater MLT.\nA few further comments are in order concerning the VPC\nestimates shown in Fig. 8 (and in Figs. 6 and 7). The first\nconcerns the sensitivity of the results to the statistical flow\nmodel employed to stabilize the spherical harmonic solu-\ntions in regions where radar data are sparse, as mentioned in\nSect. 2.1. This question has been examined quantitatively by\nre-deriving the voltage estimates using different fixed Ruo-\nhoniemi and Greenwald (1996) models appropriate to vari-\nous IMF conditions. The voltages derived typically vary by\nonly a few kV from those shown in Fig. 8, such that it is clear\nthat our results depend principally on the radar data, and not\nupon the statistical model. This may be expected from the\nfact that our radar data, in general, adequately span the re-\ngion between the foci of the flow cells, as mentioned above.\nThe importance of continuity of radar data coverage to the\nvoltage estimates is emphasized by the results of a second\nA.

In this case the voltage determinations\nbefore and after the substorm are at similar levels to those\ndisplayed in Fig. 8. However, during the substorm itself, the\nvoltage peak seen in Fig. 8 is missing entirely. Good con-\ntinuity of radar data coverage across the substorm-disturbed\nregion is thus essential for adequate estimation of the volt-\nages associated with the flow and their variation during the\nsubstorm.\n4 Discussion\nWe now discuss the physical origins of the flow excitation,\nand, following the discussion in the Introduction and that\nof Siscoe and Huang (1985), Cowley and Lockwood (1992),\nand Cowley et al. (1992, 1998), we presume that it was due\nprincipally to an interval of enhanced reconnection and net\nopen flux closure in the tail. Here we will make estimates of\nthe reconnection rates involved, and of the net flux closure,\non this basis.\nWe pointed out above that in the period prior to expan-\nsion onset the steady nature of the flow and precipitation\nboundaries indicates that this was an interval of quasi-steady\nbalanced dayside and nightside reconnection. In this case,\nthe mean reconnection rates are approximately equal to the\npolar cap voltage, so that averaging the SuperDARN volt-\nage data over the 20-min interval prior to expansion onset\nat 00:44 UT yields estimates of the pre-onset reconnection\nrates (dayside and tail) of 43\u00b1 4 kV (mean and standard de-\nviation). In the interval after the substorm, specifically over\nthe period 01:08\u201301:28 UT, we similarly find that the aver-\nage polar cap voltage was 33 \u00b1 5 kV. These values indicate\n1594 A.

The horizontal dashed\nlines show the location averaged over\n20-min intervals before and after the\nsubstorm. The vertical dashed lines are\nas in Fig. 2.\nthat the system was being driven by quasi-steady dayside re-\nconnection at a mean rate between 30 and 45 kV before and\nafter the substorm, and that this was matched by tail recon-\nnection at similar mean rates during these periods. During\nthe substorm, however, we suggest that the tail reconnec-\ntion rate was temporarily elevated above such values, while\nit seems most reasonable to suppose that dayside reconnec-\ntion continued at similar rates of 30\u201345 kV. In support of the\nlatter assumption, we note that the interplanetary conditions,\nwhich are primarily deterministic of the dayside reconnec-\ntion rate, did not change significantly over the interval (e.g.\nFig. 8), nor is there any evidence of major dayside dynamics\nin the auroral data (Fig. 7). If this is correct, we then expect\nnet destruction of open flux to have taken place during the\nsubstorm, associated with a contraction of the open-closed\nfield line boundary. Evidence for such contraction, though\nincomplete, is indeed present in our data. Specifically, we\nhave previously noted that the flow reversal boundary in the\ndusk sector, where it is most sharply defined, underwent a\npoleward displacement of \u223c1\u25e6 (Figs. 5\u20138), near the limit of\nresolution of the SuperDARN data. It is also evident that\na poleward contraction of \u223c1\u25e6\u20132\u25e6 took place in the pole-\nward boundary of the UV auroras at most local times (Fig. 7),\nthough the relationship to the motion of the open-closed field\nline boundary remains somewhat uncertain. Thus, while ev-\nidence for contraction exists, its value (of the order of \u223c1\u25e6)\nis imprecisely defined by the data we have at our disposal.\nThe analysis presented below is tailored to accommodate the\nimprecision in this parameter.\nThe physical scenario on which the calculation is based is\nillustrated in Figs. 9 and 10, where we show only the princi-\npal features, and not the details specific to the interval con-\nsidered here, such as the IMF By-related asymmetries in the\nflow, or the details of the flow suppression effects. In order\nto set the theoretical scene, we first consider the system re-\nsponse to a short-lived pulse of tail reconnection, shown in\nFig. 9. In this diagram the instantaneous open-closed field\nline boundary is shown by the heavy solid line, while the\nA. Grocott et al.: Excitation of ionospheric flow during substorms 1595\nF ig. 9\nFig. 9. Schematic of the flow which is excited by a single short-\nlived pulse of nightside reconnection. The instantaneous open-\nclosed field line boundary is shown by the heavy solid line, while\nthe plasma streamlines are shown by the lighter arrowed lines. The\nimplied boundary motion is illustrated by the large arrows, and the\nequilibrium boundary position is indicated by the dashed circle.\nplasma streamlines are shown by the lighter arrowed lines.\nWe have assumed for simplicity that the initial equilibrium\nopen-closed field line boundary is circular in shape, and that\na pulse of tail reconnection has caused a poleward displace-\nment of the boundary in the nightside sector. The flux tubes\nimmediately equatorward of the bulge have thus been newly\nreconnected in the tail, and have been added to the closed\nflux tube region in the nightside magnetosphere. This per-\nturbs the system from equilibrium, and excites flow which\ntransports flux from the nightside, around the Earth and to-\nwards the dayside, thus forming part of the Dungey cycle.\nIn the ionosphere, this transport is manifest as a twin-vortex\nflow, which is such that the open-closed field line boundary is\ncarried equatorward in the region of the nightside bulge, and\npoleward elsewhere. These motions thus return the boundary\ntowards an equilibrium circular shape with a reduced amount\nof open flux present, shown by the dashed circular line, after\nwhich the flow dies away. In effect, the action of the flow is to\ndistribute the newly closed flux in the system, approximately\nuniformly around the open-closed field line boundary.\nThe more general situation is illustrated in Fig. 10, where\nwe show the effect of a more extended interval of enhanced\ntail reconnection that takes place in the presence of steady\ndayside reconnection, such as we have inferred here. Fig-\nure 10a shows the situation in the interval of quasi-steady\nflows that occurred before substorm expansion onset. The\nheavy line represents the open-closed field line boundary,\nwith the dot-dashed portion being the merging gap mapping\nto the nightside reconnection region. The lighter arrowed\nlines represent the plasma streamlines, which thus cross the\nboundary only in the region of the merging gap, while being\n(a)\n(c)\n(b) \nFig. 10\nFig. 10. Sketch showing idealized boundary motions and plasma\nstreamlines (a) before, (b) during, and (c) after the substorm stud-\nied here, such that (a) and (c) correspond to quasi-steady states,\nwhile (b) corresponds to an interval in which the tail reconnection\nrate is enhanced and exceeds the dayside rate. The heavy lines show\nthe position of the open-closed field line boundary, which is shown\nsolid in the adiarioc portions and dot-dashed in the region of the\nnightside merging gap. The large arrows in (b) show the motion\nof the boundary after the enhancement of tail reconnection rate has\ntaken place, while the dotted line in (b) and (c) shows the initial po-\nsition of this boundary for ease of comparison. The lighter arrowed\nlines show the plasma streamlines.\naligned with the boundary in the adiaroic regions outside.\nFigure 10b corresponds to the expansion phase of the sub-\nstorm, in which tail reconnection closes open flux at an en-\nhanced rate (larger than the dayside reconnection rate), such\nthat the open-closed field line boundary now moves poleward\nas shown, beginning in the sector of the merging gap. The\ndotted line shows the previous location of the boundary for\nease of comparison. As above, the implied departure of the\nsystem from equilibrium excites Dungey-cycle convection in\nthe magnetosphere and twin-vortex flow in the ionosphere,\nwhich is such as to transport closed flux tubes away from\n1596 A. Grocott et al.: Excitation of ionospheric flow during substorms\nthe merging gap region of closure sunward to other local\ntimes. The open-closed field line boundary thus contracts\neverywhere, as indicated by the large arrows. We note that\nin this situation, the foci of the twin-vortex flow cells will\nlie approximately at the ends of the nightside merging gap,\nas shown (and hence, at the ends of the substorm bulge, as\nobserved), separating the equatorward flow of plasma across\nthe nightside merging gap from the poleward flow in the adi-\naroic boundary region outside. In this case, therefore, where\nthe nightside reconnection rate exceeds the dayside rate, the\npolar cap voltage determined from SuperDARN radar data\nwill correspond essentially to the voltage across the nightside\nmerging gap. Figure 10c shows the situation after the tail\nreconnection rate has declined once more and steady flows\nhave been resumed. This occurs when the flux redistribution\nprocess is complete, such that (in the Cowley and Lockwood\n(1992) paradigm) the net closed flux is distributed approxi-\nmately uniformly round the boundary, leaving the shape of\nthe contracted boundary approximately unchanged.\nIn order to analyze this situation, specifically for the case\nof interest here, where the nightside reconnection rate ex-\nceeds the dayside rate, we write the amount of open flux\npresent in the system as 8(t) , associated with a polar cap\narea A(t), where 8(t) \u2248 BiA(t), and Bi is the polar mag-\nnetic field strength (taken to be constant for simplicity and\nequal to 60 000 nT). The dayside and nightside reconnection\nrates are then written as 8\u02d9d(t) and 8\u02d9n(t), where by defini-\ntion 8\u02d9d(t) is positive (associated with increasing open flux),\nand 8\u02d9n(t) is negative (associated with decreasing open flux).\nThe nightside reconnection rate can then be written as\n8\u02d9n(t) = \u2212Bi\ns2\u222b\ns1\n(\n\u03bdn(t)\u2212 \u03bdB(t)\n)\nds , (1)\nwhere \u03bdn(t) is the plasma velocity normal to the boundary\n(taken as positive when directed equatorward), \u03bdB(t) is the\nboundary velocity (defined only in the normal direction and\nagain taken as positive when directed equatorward), and ds\nis the line element along the nightside merging gap of the\nopen-closed field line boundary, from the dusk end of the\nline (s1) to the dawn end (s2). The integrand in Eq. (1) simply\nrepresents the transport of magnetic flux across the nightside\nmerging gap in the latter\u2019s rest frame, per unit length of line.\nIt is readily shown that the integral of the first term in Eq. (1)\nis\nBi\ns2\u222b\ns1\n\u03bdn(t)ds = V (s2, t)\u2212 V (s1, t) \u2248 VPC(t) , (2)\nwhere V (s1, t) and V (s2, t) are the electric potentials at ei-\nther end of the nightside merging gap, VPC(t) is the to-\ntal transpolar voltage (as obtained from SuperDARN data),\nand the approximation holds when the nightside reconnec-\ntion rate is larger than the dayside reconnection rate, as noted\nabove. The integral of the second term in Eq. (1) is just the\nrate at which flux is swept out by the motion of the nightside\nreconnection line (i.e. the merging gap), taken as positive for\nequatorward motion, so that we have\n8\u02d9n(t) \u2248 \u2212VPC + Bi dAmg\ndt\n. (3)\nIntegrating these quantities over an event of duration \u03c4 , and\ndenoting averages by angle brackets, we then have\u2329\n8\u02d9n\n\u232a \u2248 \u2212\u3008VPC\u3009 + Bi1Amg\n\u03c4\n, (4)\nwhere 1Amg is the total area swept out by the nightside\nmerging gap during the event (positive for equatorward dis-\nplacements). This equation thus determines the averaged\nnightside reconnection rate during an interval in terms of the\nmean polar cap voltage during the event and the displace-\nment of the open-closed field line boundary in the region of\nthe merging gap. The dayside reconnection rate is then given\nby the relation\u2329\n8\u02d9d\n\u232a+ \u23298\u02d9n\u232a = Bi1A\n\u03c4\n, (5)\nwhere 1A is the change in total area of the polar cap during\nthe interval. Thus, introducing Eq. (4) into Eq. (5) yields\u2329\n8\u02d9d\n\u232a = \u3008VPC\u3009 + Bi1A\u22121Amg\n\u03c4\n. (6)\nWe now write 1Amg \u2248 fmg1A, such that the area swept\nout by the nightside merging gap is some fraction fmg of the\ntotal change in area of the polar cap. From Eqs. (4) and (6)\nwe then finally have\u2329\n8\u02d9n\n\u232a \u2248 \u2212\u3008VPC\u3009 + fmgBi1A\n\u03c4\n(7a)\nand\u2329\n8\u02d9d\n\u232a = \u3008VPC\u3009 + (1\u2212 fmg)Bi1A\n\u03c4\n. (7b)\nClearly, if 1Amg \u2248 0 for a particular interval, then the mag-\nnitudes of the mean dayside and nightside reconnection rates\nare equal to each other, and also equal to the mean polar cap\nvoltage \u3008VPC\u3009, as already noted above. On the other hand,\nif the polar cap area contracts during the interval such that\n1A < 0, then the magnitude of the nightside reconnection\nrate will be greater than \u3008VPC\u3009, while that of the dayside re-\nconnection rate will be less than \u3008VPC\u3009. An inconsistency\noccurs if the magnitude of the second term in Eq. (7b) ex-\nceeds the first, implying that\n\u2329\n8\u02d9d\n\u232a\nis negative, contrary to the\nassumption. However, for the event analyzed here a more\nstringent condition on\n\u2329\n8\u02d9d\n\u232a\ncan be considered, since we have\nargued above that the dayside reconnection rate probably re-\nmained in the range 30\u201345 kV during the substorm. We will,\ntherefore, impose this as a condition.\nHere we will use Eqs. (7a) and (7b) to estimate the re-\nconnection rates during the substorm expansion phase. If we\nexamine these equations it is clear that some of the parame-\nters on the right-hand sides are determined by the data better\nthan others. In particular, the mean polar cap voltage \u3008VPC\u3009\nA. Grocott et al.: Excitation of ionospheric flow during substorms 1597\nduring the intervals is reasonably well determined from the\nSuperDARN data, accepting the above interpretation of this\nquantity. On the other hand, the net area swept out by the\nopen-closed field line boundary, 1A, and the fraction fmg of\nthat associated with the nightside merging gap are not so well\ndetermined. With regard to fmg , values can be estimated on\nthe assumption that the effect of the flow is to redistribute the\nnewly closed flux uniformly around the open-closed field line\nboundary, as in the Cowley and Lockwood (1992) paradigm.\nIn this case fmg will also represent the fraction of the length\nof the open-closed field line boundary that is occupied by the\nnightside merging gap, and this can be estimated from the\nflow patterns during the expansion phase. We have shown\nabove that the maximum and minimum in the electric poten-\ntial will lie at either end of the nightside merging gap when\nthe tail reconnection rate exceeds the dayside rate, as occurs\nhere. Identification of the location of the foci of the flow\ncells thus provides an indication of the magnetic local time\nextent of the merging gap, from which fmg can be estimated.\nExamination of the flow maps during the expansion phase in\nFigs. 6 and 7 suggests fmg \u223c 0.3, and we employ a likely\nrange fmg = 0.2 \u2212 0.4. With regard to the change in polar\ncap area, we have been able to make only one approximate\ndetermination of the poleward displacement of the boundary,\nby \u223c 1\u25e6 latitude in the dusk sector where a clearly-defined\nflow reversal is evident. Our approach has been, therefore,\nto look carefully at the sensitivity of the results to these less-\nwell determined parameters.\nIn effect, what we have done is to plot contour maps of\u2329\n8\u02d9n\n\u232a\nand\n\u2329\n8\u02d9d\n\u232a\ndetermined from Eq. (7) on the fmg \u2212 1A\nplane, and to delineate regions of consistency, both with the\nrather roughly-obtained limits on these latter parameters, and\non\n\u2329\n8\u02d9d\n\u232a\nas discussed above. However, rather than use 1A di-\nrectly, we have used instead the latitude displacement of the\nboundary in the dusk local time sector. From this displace-\nment the areas 1A have been calculated by extrapolation of\nthe initial and final boundary positions to other local times.\nSpecifically, we have assumed for simplicity (and in accor-\ndance with the Cowley-Lockwood paradigm) that the initial\nand final boundaries are circles drawn about a common cen-\nter. The position of the appropriate center has been judged\nfrom the shape of the flow patterns and auroral boundaries,\nand has been chosen on this basis to be displaced from the\nmagnetic pole by 4\u25e6 of magnetic latitude along the 22 MLT\nmeridian. The displacement of the center towards the night-\nside accommodates the usual day-night asymmetry in the po-\nsition of the boundary, while the displacement towards dusk\nis suggested by the corresponding dawn-dusk asymmetry in\nthe auroral boundary and is associated with the prevailing\nsense of IMF By (negative). Examination of the flow and\nauroral patterns overall indicates that this is a very reason-\nable choice, and that no substantial improvement would re-\nsult from attempting to use some more complex boundary\nshape.\nResults are shown in Fig. 11, averaged over the interval of\nenhanced convection, i.e. over 00:44\u201301:08 UT (Fig. 8).

The horizontal dotted lines mark the likely range of\nfmg values for the substorm, with the exterior region being shaded.\nAlso shaded is the region of unlikely dayside reconnection rates ly-\ning outside the range 30\u201345 kV. The unshaded area corresponds to\nthe region of solutions that conforms to both these constraints.\ndata.

Parameter\nfmg is shown on the vertical axis, and the displacement in\nmagnetic latitude of the dusk flow reversal boundary 13B is\nshown on the horizontal axis. From the latter parameter we\nhave calculated the change in area of the polar cap accord-\ning to the above algorithm, starting from an initial boundary\nposition at 3B = 77\u25e6 (Fig. 8), so that 1A becomes increas-\ningly negative as we move from left to right across the plot.\nWe find that a 1\u25e6 poleward displacement of the boundary cor-\nresponds to a flux closure of Bi1A \u2248 \u22120.5\u00d7108 Wb, while\n2\u25e6 corresponds to \u22120.9 \u00d7 108. At the left-hand edge of the\nplot we have 13B = 0 (and 1A = 0), so that at this limit\nEqs. (7a) and (7b) give \u23298\u02d9d \u232a = \u2212 \u23298\u02d9n\u232a = \u3008VPC\u3009, as discussed\nabove.

Away from these respec-\ntive boundaries\n\u2329\n8\u02d9n\n\u232a\nbecomes increasingly negative as fmg\nand 13B both increase, while\n\u2329\n8\u02d9d\n\u232a\ndrops to smaller values\nas fmg decreases and 13B increases. Eventually\n\u2329\n8\u02d9d\n\u232a\nbe-\ncomes negative in the dark-shaded area in the bottom right\ncorner of the plot, this representing an area of inconsistent\nresults (as discussed above) when (1 \u2212 fmg)1A becomes\ntoo negative.\n1598 A. Grocott et al.: Excitation of ionospheric flow during substorms\nWe now consider the likely ranges of the controlling pa-\nrameters, and the consequent likely range of values of the\nreconnection rates. First, we indicated above that the likely\nrange of fmg was between \u223c0.2 and 0.4. This range is\nmarked by the horizontal dotted lines, and the exterior re-\ngion is shown shaded. Second, according to our above ar-\nguments, we can reasonably expect the dayside reconnection\nrate to have lain in the range \u223c30 to \u223c45 kV during the in-\nterval. The regions outside these limits are also shaded. It\ncan be seen that these two conditions delimit an area on the\nplot which spans a range of 13B between \u223c0.5\u25e6 and\u223c1.5\u25e6.\nThis result is, therefore, completely consistent with the Su-\nperDARN dusk boundary data, which indicate a poleward\ncontraction by \u223c1\u25e6, near the limit of resolution of the data.\nThese latter observations do not, therefore, impose any fur-\nther constraints in this case. The implication of the results in\nFig. 11 is thus that the mean nightside reconnection rate dur-\ning the substorm, averaged over the 24-min interval 00:44\u2013\n01:08 UT, was\u223c70 kV, lying in the range\u223c65\u201375 kV. There-\nfore, we further estimate that the total magnetic flux closed in\nthe tail during the substorm was\u223c 0.9\u22121.1\u00d7108 Wb, com-\npared with \u223c 0.4\u2212 0.6\u00d7 108 Wb, which was opened on the\ndayside over the same interval. The net flux closed during the\nsubstorm was thus also \u223c 0.4 \u2212 0.6 \u00d7 108 Wb, correspond-\ning to a \u223c1\u25e6 contraction of the boundary overall. We also\nestimate the total amount of open flux present prior to sub-\nstorm onset to have been \u223c 3\u00d7 108 Wb, this representing an\nentirely typical value under general conditions, and for pre-\nsubstorm intervals in particular (Newell et al., 2001). Thus,\nthe net flux closed during the substorm represents \u223c15\u201320%\nof the total open flux present prior to onset.\n5 Summary\nThe main points which we wish to emphasise are as follows.\n(a) Ionospheric flow was excited in concert with the onset\nand decay of the expansion phase of an isolated high-latitude\nsubstorm of modest amplitude and duration. The flow was\nof twin-vortex form with foci on the nightside at either end\nof the substorm auroral bulge. The transpolar voltage as-\nsociated with the flow increased from \u223c40 kV prior to on-\nset, to peak at \u223c80 kV after 15 min, which was \u223c5 min af-\nter the peak in the magnetic disturbance. The flow then de-\nclined back down to \u223c35 kV over \u223c10 min in the recovery\nphase. During this interval the IMF remained steady, with\nBy \u2248 \u22129 nT, and Bz \u2248 +5 nT. The flow enhancement (and\nsubstorm) is inferred to have resulted from a burst of recon-\nnection in the pre-midnight plasma sheet.\n(b) The return flows of the enhanced flow pattern extended\nwidely on either side of the region directly effected by the\nsubstorm, over the polar cap, and into the dayside sector.\nThe changed and enhanced flow pattern, combined with pre-\nvailing ionospheric conductivities, produced magnetic dis-\nturbances of modest amplitude over a large area surrounding\nthe substorm-disturbed region. These data thus support the\nprior conclusions of Grafe et al. (1987) and Opgenoorth and\nPellinen (1998), based principally on magnetic data from the\ndusk sector, that a prompt response in the global convection\nsystem often occurs at expansion phase onset. Opgenoorth\nand Pellinen suggested that the response could be produced\nby a suppression of the flow in the region of dipolarized flux\nin the nightside magnetosphere, mapping essentially to the\nsubstorm bulge, resulting in a deflection of the surrounding\nflow around this region. Such deflection would give rise to\na flow enhancement on either side of the bulge, but this ef-\nfect alone would result in no change in the overall transpolar\nvoltage. For the localized substorm studied here, however,\nwe have found that the principal effect was the excitation of\nnew voltage during the expansion phase, in which the total\ntranspolar voltage increased by a factor of two.\n(c) Flow suppression within and deflection around the\ndipolarized region (the blob of brightest auroral emission)\noccurred during the expansion phase, as observed in previ-\nous studies by Morelli et al. (1995), Yeoman et al. (2000),\nand Khan et al. (2001). However, in the present case, the\nregion effected was relatively small and localized near mid-\nnight, such that this represented a distinct but secondary ef-\nfect. The main flow effect in this particular substorm was\nthus the overall enhancement mentioned above.\n(d) The nightside reconnection rate averaged over the\n\u223c24-min substorm interval of enhanced flows is estimated\nto have been \u223c65\u201375 kV, compared with continuing day-\nside reconnection rates of \u223c30\u201345 kV. The net destruction\nof open flux during the substorm is thus estimated to have\nbeen\u223c 0.4\u22120.6\u00d7108 Wb, which corresponds to\u223c15\u201320%\nof the open flux present at onset. The corresponding overall\ncontraction of the open-closed field line boundary during the\nsubstorm was thus \u223c1\u25e6 latitude, close to the resolution limit\nof the SuperDARN data.\nThe explanation we have forwarded for the flow effect ob-\nserved here, in terms of the contribution of tail reconnection\nand field dipolarization to Dungey cycle convection, should\nhold for substorms in general. We may, therefore, expect\nthat such flow excitation should be a common feature of sub-\nstorm intervals. Factors which might mitigate against a clear\nidentification of the effect in general cases include (a) vari-\nations in the direction and strength of the IMF during the\nsubstorm, which produce additional modulations of the flow\ndriven by magnetopause reconnection; (b) large-scale flow\nreconfigurations on the nightside due to flow suppression and\ndeflection effects over larger areas of the substorm bulge;\n(c) dropout of radar backscatter from the crucial substorm-\ndisturbed region due to ionospheric absorption; and (d) in-\nadequate imaging of the flow pattern within the collective\nfield of view of the radar array, which is limited both in local\ntime and in latitude. The identification of the flow enhance-\nment effect in the present data set clearly resulted from a\nrather fortunate combination of geophysical and operational\ncircumstances. A future agenda is set, however, to search for\nrelated features in other substorms.\nAcknowledgements.
