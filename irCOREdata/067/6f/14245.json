This project is being developed in response to the\nincreasing demand for flexible, high-quality staff development materials. Following the\n28\nALT-J . Volume 9 Number 2\ncreation of the Institute for Learning and Teaching (http:\/\/www.ilt.ac.uk) and the impact of\nthe Investors in People (http:\/\/www.iipuk.co.uk) programme, institutions are increasingly\nappreciating the necessity of providing their staff with opportunities for continuous\nprofessional development. However, producing high-quality staff development materials\ntailored to address an extensive range of educational requirements and delivering these\nmaterials efficiently and effectively to a wide body of staff can be challenging, costly and\ntime-consuming. In addition, this responsibility may frequently be distributed across\nseveral departments in any given institution. In order to cater for such diverse and dynamic\nlearner requirements, staff developers are increasingly turning towards communication\nand information technologies' as an efficient platform for supporting trie delivery of flexible\nlearning resources (Littlejohn and Cameron, 1999). However, to create such materials, staff\ndevelopers must possess not only a thorough appreciation of pedagogical principles but\nalso a detailed understanding of technical procedures. Access to pedagogically sound case\nstudies and best-practice exemplars is also helpful to allow'staff developers to illustrate the\nprocess of creating learning materials from theoretical inception through design,\nimplementation and evaluation. The expertise and resources required to create high-\nquality educational materials of this kind are not always available in a single staff\ndevelopment unit.\nOne posaBie^olutibiS^oiffi&pro of\nonline resources. However, there are many barriers that have traditionally prevented\nacademic staff from sharing their materials. These barriers range from technical problems\nsuch as the use of incompatible systems and file formats to deep-seated concerns over the\nquality assurance of externally produced materials and the loss of. intellectual property\nrights. In addition, as institutions are increasingly being encouraged to commercialize, it is\nunderstandable that academics might be unwilling to share materials freely, especially if\nthey carry accreditation and have significant economic potential. .. \u2022\nThe Electronic Library\nThe Scottish electronic Staff Development Library (SeSDL) is attempting to address these\nissues through the creation of a Web-based resource centre designed to encourage the\nsharing and reuse of staff development materials. The electronic library is a repository of\nreuseable resources contributed by the Scottish staff development user community and\nheld on a central server, as opposed'to an information gateway, defined by Belcher as 'an\nonline service that provides links to numerous other sites or documents on the Internet'\n(Belcher, Place and Conole, 2000). The resource centre primarily hosts materials that focus\non the use of C&IT for teaching and learning, which can be delivered via the Web and\nwhich can accommodate a number of different flexible approaches to staff development.\nGranules and metadata\nLibrary materials are stored in the form of 'granules', the smallest logical components into\nwhich educational materials can be divided (Duncan, Bennett, Bond, Douglas, Black,\nBarrcra, Deruy and Gonduouin, forthcoming). A granule may be a single Web page, a\nlinked series of Web pages, an online assessment, an audio file, a video clip or even a single\nimage or diagram.^  The level of granularity is defined by the content author, when each\nresource is uploadedto the library. Each.granule is accompanied by a set.of IMS metadata\n29\nLomo M. Campbell et a\/ Reuse of academic resources through the Scottish electronic Staff Development Library\n(Anderson and Wason, 2000) that is both searchable and extensible. This metadata not\nonly includes core fields such as author, date, version, format, etc., but also encompasses\neach granule's educational associations and conditions and history of use.\nLibrary interface\nWithin the library interface staff developers can assemble these granular components as\nthey require, in order to build customized lessons tailored to meet the training needs of\ntheir own departments and institutions. Granular materials can also be added to the\nlibrary by staff developers who see the potential for their reuse at a national and even\ninternational level. In this way the considerable effort involved in producing high-quality\neducational materials may be shared among many institutions. The resulting lessons will be\naccessible directly through the electronic library or can be exported as standard IMS\ncontent packages (Anderson and McKell, 2000) which can be imported into any other\nIMS-supporting virtual learning environment. The Scottish electronic Staff Development\nLibrary is being developed from a tried and tested Web-based framework which has been\ncreated and refined by the EuroMET {http:llwww.euromet.met.ed.aauk) project and the\nNational Learning Network for Remote Sensing {http:\/\/www.nln.met.ed.aauk)\nJ\u00a3j The Scottish electronic Staff Development Libiaiy - Netscape\n.

Amongst wide-\nranging aims this consultancy sought to identify gaps in the current provision of\nC&IT-related staff development resources, to record attitudes towards the sharing and reuse\nof materials, to identify factors which would encourage or discourage staff from contributing\nresources to the library and generally prioritize users' requirements. The consultancy\nprocedure comprised two workshops, a follow-up video-conference open to all Scottish HEIs,\ndiscussions and hands-on trials of a pre-prototype user interface. Data were gathered through\na series of group discussions and questionnaires. The questionnaires recorded the confidential\nresponses of individual staff developers for later analysis, while the discussions gave\nparticipants the opportunity to explore further some of the specific issues that arose.\nThe invitation to participate in the consultancy was extended to staff developers at twenty-\none Scottish HEIs. Rather than canvassing the Scottish staff development community as a\nwhole, the project targeted the smaller subset of colleagues who are already supporting the\nuse of C&IT for teaching and learning. These are the staff developers who have the\npotential to contribute resources to the library and who will be offered the opportunity to\nbecome early adopters of the prototype system. SeSDL were successful in engaging a high\npercentage of this target audience to participate in the consultancy procedure. A total of\nthirty-two staff developers currently supporting the use of C&IT for teaching and learning\ncontributed to the consultancy workshops and follow up video-conference. Many of the\nstaff who participated are also involved with other SHEFC-funded C&IT projects. SeSDL\nhas continued to liaise closely and foster links with these projects in order to maximize the\noutputs of the electronic library project and ScotCIT programme as a whole.\nStaff developers with little or no experience of using C&IT for teaching and learning were\nnot invited to participate in this initial consultancy procedure; their feedback may,\nhowever, be sought at a later date as learners using the library under the guidance of their\nearly adopter colleagues. Ultimately it is hoped that those staff developers who currently\nfocus more on theory and pedagogy than on the use of communication and information\ntechnology will eventually go on to contribute their own considerable resource base of\nknowledge and learning to the library. This synergy between pedagogical and technological\nexpertise will be crucial if the electronic library is to fulfil its true potential and become\nwidely adopted throughout the staff development community.\nMethodology\nDuring the initial stage of the consultation a total of twenty-six participants attended one\nof two workshops which explored the potential of online learning resources for staff\ndevelopment. These workshops conducted an assessment of the varying institutional\nrequirements of staff developers through a series of questionnaires and group discussions.\nThe first questionnaire focused on the current availability of materials, modes of teaching,\nfactors which would encourage or inhibit use of the library, institutional implementation,\nusing externally produced resources, copyright, intellectual property rights (IPR), quality\nassurance and contributing and sharing materials. The second questionnaire recorded\nconfidence in using the Internet for teaching and learning, current use of C&IT tools,\npractical aspects of using the library and the level of support required. A brief preliminary\nanalysis of these questionnaires was posted to the SeSDL Website shortly after the final\nworkshop along with a 'wish list' of requirements distilled from the many suggestions put\n31\nLoma M. Campbell et al Reuse of academic resources through the Scottish electronic Staff Development Library\nforward by the workshop participants. One month later SeSDL hosted a follow up video-\nconference that was attended by seventeen staff from eleven institutions. The results of the\nprimary workshop analysis and the 'wish list' were presented to the participants who then\nhad the opportunity to prioritize their requirements further. A first draft of the electronic\nlibrary's 'Conditions of Use' agreement, formulated following in-depth discussions at both\nworkshops, was also presented at the video-conference. \u2022 \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 \u2022\u2022\u2022'\nAnalysis\nGiven the ever-widening remit of staff developers and the range of pedagogies and\nlearning styles they must accommodate, it is perhaps unsurprising that the consultancy\nprocedure resulted in a wide diversity of user requirements. However the video-conference\nwhich followed the initial consultancy workshops allowed staff developers to prioritize the\nrequirements derived from the workshop questionnaires and discussions. As a result it has\nbeen possible to summarize the primary outcomes of the consultancy-procedure as follows.\nUsing an online library\nThe majority of staff developers who participated in the consultancy procedure agreed\nthat an online library of staff development materials would be a valuable addition to the\nresources currently available to them. The staff developers questioned responded positively\nto the development of the online library and saw no major institutional barriers that would\nprevent them from accessing such a resource and integrating it into their current\ncurriculum. However, it is worth reiterating that the majority of staff developers who\nparticipated in this consultancy procedure were already familiar; with using C&IT for\nteaching, and learning. While these staff appear enthusiastic about the potential of the\nelectronic library it is possible that other staff developers and learners who are less familiar\nwith the technology may require some encouragement to integrate such a resource with\ntheir current framework of teaching and learning.\nPedagogical requirements \u2022 , \u2022.\nAmong the wide range of user requirements identified through the consultancy procedure,\none of the most significant is the necessity for the online resource base to be able to\naccommodate a wide range of pedagogies, both in terms of content and delivery. All\nconsultancy participants clearly prioritized the demand for materials focusing on process\nand pedagogy, and for practical case studies that demonstrate sound pedagogy and\nillustrate how to embed C&IT within the staff development curriculum. Guidelines on\nlegal and ethical issues relating to IPR, equality and accessibility were alsb identified as a\nhigh priority. Consultancy participants also indicated that the library must have the ability\nto deliver materials in such a way that they can accommodate the varied pedagogies and\nmodes of teaching employed by staff developers to achieve their wide-ranging educational\ngoals and to meet the varied needs of their learners. The granular nature of the library\ncontent will help to maximize the potential of the available materials tomeet these diverse\npedagogical requirements. As materials will be stored in the form of granules, rather than\nas complete courses, staff developers have the ability to tailor these resources to create\ncourses that meet their own specific requirements and those of their learners. Each course\nand its mode;of delivery will be unique. : \u2022 \u2022 . r-:. \u2022\u2022'\n32\nALT-J Volume 9 Number 2\nUsing externally produced materials\nParticipants responded extremely positively to the prospect of being able to access\nresources produced out-with their own institutions. However, this enthusiasm was qualified\nby the condition that most staff developers would only consider using externally produced\nmaterials if they were quality-controlled, peer-reviewed and of clearly identifiable\nauthorship and provenance. It is possible that this positive attitude towards externally\nproduced materials partially results from the success of initiatives such as TALiSMAN\n(http:llwww.talisman.hw.ac.ukl) and Netskills (http:\/\/www.netskiHs.ac.ukf), which have\nproduced a range of high-quality resources that have been widely adopted throughout the\nstaff development community. The electronic library will address many of the concerns\nrelating to the quality and provenance of externally produced materials by ensuring that all\ngranules are accompanied by a comprehensive set of metadata. This metadata includes,\namongst many other fields, the author's name and institution, the date the granule was\nauthored and the degree to which it can be reused. While granules submitted to the library\nwill not undergo a formal review procedure, a dynamically generated history of use\neffectively results in a continuous peer-review process. In addition to recording\nautomatically who has used each granule, the library will also allow users to search for\nwidely used granules on any given topic.\nShared resources, I PR, copyright and conditions of use\nWhile the staff questioned during the consultancy procedure were clearly keen to access\nresources produced by the wider staff development community, they appeared to be rather\nmore reticent about committing their own materials to a shared resource base. Predictably,\nloss of copyright and intellectual property rights were cited as two of the most significant\nconcerns relating to the sharing of resources. Many of these concerns can be dealt with by\nthe detailed information contained in the metadata that accompanies all granules submitted\nto the library. As outlined above, this metadata includes a full suite of information recording\nthe granule's author and provenance. In addition SeSDL guarantees that once a granule has\nbeen uploaded to the library it will not be altered or further subdivided. If a user wishes to\nedit or amend an existing granule a new instance of that granule will be created along with a\nnew set of metadata which records the granule's original author and subsequent editors.\nWhile the library retains copyright of this metadata, copyright of the granules themselves\nresides with the original authors and their institutions.\nIn addition to copyright and IPR concerns, financial factors were also of consideration,\nparticularly in relation to the use of shared resources for potentially profitable consultancy\ncontracts. Many of the staff developers questioned initially indicated that they would be\nless willing to share materials if there was a possibility that other staff developers would be\nable to use these materials for profit.\nAnother problematic issue raised was that of reciprocity. Some consultancy participants,\nparticularly those from larger institutions; felt that while they might be in a position to\ncontribute material to the library they would have little to gain if other institutions did not\nsubmit corresponding resources. This led to the suggestion that entry to the library user\ngroup or community should be dictated by an institution's willingness or ability to\ncontribute materials. Although the adoption of such a policy may have encouraged certain\n33\nLorna M. Campbell et al Reuse of academic resources through the Scottish electronic Staff Development Library\ngroups of users to contribute to the library, SeSDL decided against this policy, primarily\nbecause it would disadvantage institutions with a smaller pool of staff developers and\nresources. These are precisely the users to whom the library should be of greatest value. In\norder to encourage colleagues and early adopters to support and contribute to the\nelectronic library, SeSDL will initially populate the resource base with a range of high-\nquality granular learning resources focusing on the use of learning technologies. SeSDL\nwill also provide access to resources produced by some of the other current ScotCIT\nprojects in order to encourage the sharing of resources between institutions.\nMany of the concerns voiced by the staff developers who participated in the consultancy\nprocedure may result from a lack of collaboration between HEIs; there has previously been\nlittle encouragement or incentive to share academic resources between institutions. The\nSeSDL project hopes to overcome these reservations by fostering a collaborative ethos and\nby producing a resources base that will encourage and facilitate the sharing and reuse of\nacademic resources in a controlled educational environment. As the Scottish electronic\nStaff Development Library is a SHEFC-funded initiative, the SeSDL team agreed that\nmaterials produced directly through the project should be made freely available to all\nSHEFC-funded institutions. Following lengthy discussions with the consultancy\nparticipants, it was also decided that authors should only submit material to the library if\nthey agreed that the materials could be used by staff in any SHEFC-funded institution in\nthe normal course of their business, with the normal course of a university's business being\ntaken to include research and consultancy as well as teaching.\nIn order to clarify these complex issues SeSDL has drawn up a 'Conditions of Use'\nagreement which all library contributors and users must acknowledge and accept. This\nagreement states that the copyright of each granule resides with the author, or author's\ninstitution, and that it is the responsibility of the author to seek permission from co-\nauthors or third party authors before uploading material to the library. Copyright of the\nmetadata resides with the library itself and while this metadata will be made freely\navailable, the library also guarantees that the granules themselves will always be\naccompanied by their associated metadata. All contributors must agree that their materials\ncan be used freely by all Scottish higher education institutions in the normal course of their\nbusiness, which is taken to include research and consultancy. However the right to dictate\nthe degree to which granules can be reused out-with the Scottish higher education\ncommunity lies with the author. An additional clause allows contributors the option of\nextending this free access to all UK HEIs. However, anyone out-with the UK HEI\ncommunity wishing to use these resources is required to contact the author directly to\nrequest permission and agree conditions of use and any associated costs.\nThe Conditions of Use agreement represents SeSDL's best efforts to protect library\ncontributors' intellectual property rights. All contributors must agree to these conditions of\nuse before uploading their resources to the electronic library. The SeSDL project is aware\nthat little can be done to prevent individuals from maliciously breaching copyright within\nthe electronic library, but the potential danger of plagiarism and breach of copyright is not\nconfined solely to shared electronic resources. As SeSDL is committed to facilitating the\nsharing of educational resources and fostering collaboration between institutions, it will\naccept the Conditions of Use agreement and all materials submitted to the library in good\nfaith and would urge users and contributors to do likewise.\n34\nALT-J Volume 9 Number 2\nThe electronic library is still under development and the Conditions of Use have only\nrecently been fully implemented so it is too early to state with confidence whether this\nagreement will encourage or discourage colleagues from contributing their valuable\nresources to the library. However, initial reactions to an early draft of the SeSDL\nConditions of Use have been promising, the agreement met with widespread approval\nwithin the staff development community and beyond and it has already been adopted by\nother C&IT projects. While the final agreement may not find multilateral agreement across\nall HEIs, SeSDL believe that if the library is successfully to promote an ethos of sharing\nand is to facilitate the reuse of resources then those resources should be made available to\nall Scottish HE staff on an equal basis.\nA library needs a librarian\nWhile the consultancy participants predominantly responded that they were confident in\nusing online resources for teaching and learning, they also indicated that the library would\nhave to provide a considerable degree of support if it is to be widely adopted throughout\nthe staff development community. Some of the support requested relates to technical\nprocedures such as converting, granularizing and uploading materials and navigating the\nuser interface. However, many participants also indicated that to fulfil its potential the\nlibrary must also provide users with guidance on classifying uploaded materials, accessing\nexisting materials and selecting those that are most appropriate for their learners'\nrequirements. This was summed up by one staff developer's insistence that 'a library needs\na librarian' - a guide to help users locate appropriate resources.\nWhile a librarian would be a valuable addition to the electronic library, unfortunately there\nare insufficient resources available to support the provision of such a service throughout\nthe funded phase of the project and beyond. Supporting projects beyond their initial phase\nof funding is a perennial problem and one of which SeSDL is well aware. One of the\nclearly stated aims of the SeSDL project is that ownership and control of the electronic\nlibrary should be transferred progressively to the staff development community as a whole\nin an attempt to overcome the need for continued technical support (Duncan, Maclaren,\nFinnigan, Gordon and Littlejohn, 1999). In order to do this the library has been designed\nin such a way as to place as much functionality as possible in the hands of the users. All\nlibrary users must have the ability to upload easily, classify, locate, evaluate and implement\nresources with minimal support.\nThe IMS metadata that accompanies all library granules will be invaluable in helping users\nto locate and access resources. The library upload tool, which will allow contributors to\nadd granules to the library, has been designed to automate much of the process of adding\nmetadata to the resources. Library users can then search for resources using either a simple\nsearch tool that searches through all metadata fields or an advanced search tool that allows\nusers to search through selected metadata fields.\nMetadata is invaluable for describing and locating resources, but SeSDL also believed that\nthe library should enable authors to classify their resources and, in addition, help users to\ncontextualize the academic content of each granule. For this reason SeSDL decided that\nthe library's functionality would be improved by the development of a standard\neducational taxonomy, an ordered classification system where information is grouped\n35\nLorna M.

The taxonomy will provide contributors with\na framework to classify their materials and, in addition, will help users to contexualize\nlibrary resources through the creation of a browse tree, which can group materials together\nby common themes and content. Hopefully such a taxonomy will fulfil some of the\nfunctions of a librarian.\n\u2022ft The Scottish electronic Staff Development Libraiy - Netscape HEE3I\nFte Edit View Go Communicator Help\nBack Forward Betoad Home Search Netscape-- - Prn-tf Security Shop\nBookmarks Jj.

Existing educational thesauri such as the Thesaurus of ERIC\nDescriptors (http:Hwww.csal.co.uk\/helpV3\/ericthes.html) and the European Education\nThesaurus (http:llwww.eurydice.org\/TeeFormlframeset_en.htm) were considered but\nsubsequently rejected, as their terminology does not match UK English usage in higher\neducation closely enough. The TLTP3 Database of Case Studies Vocabulary\n{http:llwww.hcu.ox.aauk\/vocabulary\/) was also investigated. Although this vocabulary did\nnot have sufficient scope to meet the electronic library's requirements it proved to be a\nvaluable starting-point for the development of the SeSDL taxonomy.\nSeSDL has now developed an educational taxonomy covering the fields of educational\ndevelopment, educational technology, academic management, resource types and subjects\n(http:llwww.sesdl.scotcit.ac.uk\/taxonomyl). A full analysis of the development and\nimplementation of the SeSDL taxonomy will be presented in future publications. This\ntaxonomy has attempted to encompass vocabularies which describe not only the use of\nC&IT for teaching and learning but also more generic educational practices and\n36\nALT-J Volume 9 Number 2\npedagogical principles in a language that is comprehensible to all staff developers. Within\nthe library the taxonomy allows users to classify their resources at the point of upload and\nin addition has facilitated the creation of a hierarchical browse tree. The wider aim of the\nSeSDL taxonomy is to help make academic materials as accessible and interoperable as\npossible. If the taxonomy is successful in fulfilling these functions and if it is adopted as a\nstandard by other related C&IT projects then it will increasingly enable users to access\nmaterials from a wide range of sources.\nConclusion\nThe SeSDL consultancy procedure has clearly indicated that while staff developers are\nenthusiastic about the potential of accessing a shared repository of common resources they\nare still perhaps reticent about the prospect of sharing their own materials freely between\ninstitutions. This contradictory position perhaps results from the current dichotomy\nwhereby institutions are increasingly expected to collaborate to receive research funding but,\nat the same time, are encouraged to commercialize and to draw in external funding through\nresearch, consultancy and the exploitation of commercial potential. However, SeSDL\nbelieve that if staff developers are to meet the changing needs of their learners and to fulfil\nefficiently and effectively the increasing demand for high-quality staff development\nmaterials they should seriously consider not only reusing but also sharing their resources.\nThe primary aim of the SeSDL project is to construct a resource base of interoperable staff\ndevelopment materials that will facilitate such sharing. As library materials are stored in the\nform of granules, rather than in the form of complete courses, individual institutions have\nthe ability to tailor these resources to create courses that meet their own specific\nrequirements and those of their learners. As each course and its mode of delivery will be\nunique, it remains the responsibility of each institution to seek accreditation for these\ncourses, as and when they see fit. By sharing granular materials through the electronic\nlibrary, not only is the profile of the authors and their institutions raised, but all staff\ndevelopers have access to a wider pool of resources. As well as sharing resources library\nusers also have the opportunity to share their real teaching and learning experiences.\nIt is too early to predict with confidence how successful the electronic library project will\nbe in achieving these complex aims and objectives. However, SeSDL believe that the\ncreation of an online environment where materials can be shared and reused in a standard\nformat and on an equal basis is an important first step towards fostering the development\nof a collaborative ethos and facilitating the establishment of a wide pool of interoperable\neducational resources. Through this consultancy procedure the Scottish electronic Staff\nDevelopment Library will maximize the potential of this resource base to address the\nrequirements of all staff developers and meet the needs of learners within the Scottish\nhigher education community and beyond.\nAcknowledgements\nSeSDL would like to thank all those who participated in the consultancy procedure and to\nacknowledge their valuable contribution to the project.\nThe SeSDL Project team are: Dr Charles Duncan and Eddie Boyle, University of\nEdinburgh, Dr Iain MacLaren, Tom Finnigan and Celeste McLaughlin, University of\n37\nLoma M.
