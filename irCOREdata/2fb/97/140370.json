Shearography is usu-\nally used for qualitative investigation of surface and\nsubsurface defects. A speckle pattern is formed by illumi-\nnating an optically rough surface by an expanded laser\nbeam. This speckle pattern is optically mixed with an iden-\ntical, but displaced, speckle pattern using a shearing device,\nsuch as a shearing Michelson interferometer,1 forming a\nspeckle interferogram, that can be recorded by a camera.\nCorrelation of speckle interferograms recorded before and\nafter object deformation yields correlation fringes sensitive\nto the gradient of displacement.\nDigital speckle photography ~DSP!3\u20136 can be used to\ndetermine the displacement of speckles in the plane of the\ncamera image. As in the case of shearography, a speckle\npattern is formed by illuminating an optically rough surface\nby an expanded laser beam. This speckle pattern is not\noptically mixed, but is recorded directly by the camera. A\nsecond speckle pattern is recorded after object deformation.\nThe displacement fields may be determined using either\ndigital speckle photography correlation techniques ~SPC!6\nor optical flow field techniques ~OFF!.7 The displacement\nfield is subsequently differentiated to yield the displace-\n0091-3286\/2005\/$22.00 \u00a9 2005 SPIE025602Optical Engineering\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 22 Jul 2011 toment gradient. Previously, DSP has been used to measure\nthe magnitude of the applied shear in shearography8 and to\ncompensate for bulk object motion before correlation of\ninterferograms in speckle interferometry.9\nFull characterization of the surface strain requires the\nmeasurement of six components of displacement gradient.\nA full surface strain measurement may be made using\nshearography.10 This requires illumination, or viewing, of\nthe surface under investigation from three or more\ndirections,11 and the use of two directions of applied shear.\nEach measurement channel, in general, is sensitive to a\nmixture of the in-plane and out-of-plane displacement gra-\ndient components. The in-plane and out-of-plane displace-\nment gradient components are obtained by a coordinate\ntransformation. However, to minimize errors in the coordi-\nnate transformation process, angles of illumination of 20\ndeg or more from the normal to the object surface would\nhave to be employed.12 For this reason, a shearography\ninstrument employing single-axis illumination and viewing\nwould only be able to measure the out-of-plane displace-\nment gradient components. Typically, shearography has a\nsensitivity of the order of tens of microstrain. DSP can\ndetermine the in-plane displacement components directly,\nbut the determination of the out-of-plane component re-\nquires multiple viewing directions using a stereoscopic\ntechnique.13 For illumination and viewing normal to the\nobject surface, only the in-plane displacement, and, by dif-\nferentiation, the in-plane displacement gradient compo--1 February 2005\/Vol. 44(2)\n 138.250.86.167.

The DSP technique has\na lower sensitivity than shearography, and is of the order of\nhundreds of microstrain.\nIn this work, shearography is used to measure the out-\nof-plane displacement gradient components, while the DSP\nimage processing technique of optical flow field is used to\nmeasure the in-plane displacement gradient components.\nExperimental measurements of full surface strain measure-\nment are performed using the combined shearography and\ndigital speckle photography instrument.\n2 Shearography\nThe full-field optical technique of shearography is sensitive\nto a displacement gradient component, which is determined\nby the sensitivity vector, which is the bisector of the illu-\nmination and viewing direction vectors, and the direction of\napplied shear. The sensitivity is adjustable by changing the\nmagnitude of shear applied using the shearing element in\nthe interferometer.\nThe out-of-plane displacement gradient can be measured\ndirectly by using collinear illumination and viewing normal\nto the object surface.14 Illumination at a small angle to the\nnormal is usually employed, as this is easier to implement\nexperimentally. This configuration is still highly sensitive\nto the out-of-plane displacement gradient component, and\nis employed in the experimental section of this work.\nFor this configuration, the sensitivity to the out-of-plane\ndisplacement gradient dw\/dx is given by:\nDf5\n4p\nl cos u\ndw\ndx\ndx , ~1!\nwhere Df is the optical phase change, l is the optical\nwavelength, dx is the magnitude of applied shear, u is the\nangle between the illumination direction and the normal to\nthe object surface, and cos u;1.0. A similar expression may\nbe obtained for a shear applied in the orthogonal y direc-\ntion. The magnitude of the applied shear lies typically be-\ntween 1 and 10 mm.\nPhase-stepping techniques15 are commonly used to ex-\ntract the phase information from interferograms in speckle\ninterferometry. This technique eliminates ambiguity in the\ndirection of phase change due to the object deformation. In\nthis work, a three-step 2p\/3 radians phase-step algorithm is\nused. The phase Df is calculated using:\nDf5A3\n~ uD2R1u2uD2R3u!\n~2uD2R2u2uD2R1u2uD2R3u!\n, ~2!\nwhere R1 , R2 , and R3 are phase-stepped reference images\nfor the phase steps 22p\/3, 0, and 2p\/3 radians, respec-\ntively, recorded before object deformation, and D is the\nimage recorded at the phase step of 0 radians after object\ndeformation.\n3 Digital Speckle Photography\nThe experimental considerations are identical for both the\nDSP techniques of SPC6 and OFF.7 The optically rough\nsurface of the object is illuminated by an expanded laser\nbeam forming a speckle pattern.

The difference\nbetween the SPC and OFF techniques lies in the approach\nto the image processing.\nSpeckle pattern correlation is an established technique\nfor the investigation of speckle patterns. However, previous\nwork16\u201318 has identified issues regarding the selection of\nthe size of the correlation window and the necessity to in-\nterpolate to achieve subpixel accuracy in the analysis. The\ntechnique is computationally intensive.\nIn this work, the OFF technique is used to determine the\nin-plane displacement. The OFF technique is defined as the\ndisplacement distribution of the apparent motion of the in-\ntensity pattern on the image plane of the observer.7 It is\nassumed that the change in pixel intensity values is solely\ndue to the motion of the speckle pattern, and that the mo-\ntion of the speckle pattern is directly related to the displace-\nment of the surface, as stated in Eq. ~3!:\nE~x ,y ,t !5E~x1u ,y1v ,t1Dt !, ~3!\nwhere E(x ,y ,t) is the intensity distribution at time t and\nE(x1u ,y1v ,t1Dt) is the intensity distribution at time t\n1Dt . The intensity of the point (x ,y) in the image re-\ncorded at time t is equal to the intensity of the point (x\n1u ,y1v) at time t1Dt .\nAs it is assumed that the intensity at a point on the\nobject surface does not change, only the position within the\nimage changes, a constraint on the intensity can be intro-\nduced; this is known as the constant brightness constraint.\nThis can be expressed mathematically by differentiation of\nEq. ~3! using the chain rule, yielding:\nExu1Eyv1Et50, ~4!\nwhere Ex5dE\/dx , Ey5dE\/dy , and Et5dE\/dt . Dt is de-\nfined as equal to 1 when loading the object statically to\nsimplify the calculation. In the analysis, the error term jb is\ncalculated as a measure of the departure from the constant\nbrightness constraints calculated using:\njb5Exu1Eyv1Et . ~5!\nIn the analysis of the pair of images, the minimum value of\nthe error term jb is determined by a least squares tech-\nnique.\nThe OFF technique also requires that the smoothness\nconstraint is met, i.e., that neighboring points on the surface\nhave similar velocities7 and that higher-order image spatial\ngradients are similar.19 This is also achieved by minimiza-\ntion of an error term using a least squares technique. A\ndirectional smoothness constraint was introduced by Fu and\nPridmore,20 which considers that the directions of the de-\nforming vectors of the neighboring points on the surface\nshould vary smoothly. This modified smoothness constraint\nwas originally introduced for the investigation of discon-\ntinuous surfaces that are found in fluid flows, but is also\nsuitable for the investigation of small local deformations.\nMathematically, the error term for the modified smoothness\nconstraint jc is found by:-2 February 2005\/Vol. 44(2)\n11 to 138.250.86.167.

The beam expansion lens was located\n600 mm from the object and 90 mm below the normal to\nthe center of the object surface.\nThe shearography head contained a shearing Michelson\ninterferometer, a camera lens, and a charge-coupled device\n~CCD! camera ~CA-D4-0512A, 75-Hz frame rate, 512\n3512 pixels, 8 bit, Dalsa, Waterloo, ON!. The shearing\ninterferometer was composed of a beamsplitter, a shearing\nmirror, and a reference mirror mounted on a piezoelectric\ntransducer to perform the phase stepping. The shutter was\nused to block the shearing mirror to allow speckle patterns\nto be recorded for the DSP analysis. The shearing mirror\nwas adjustable to select different magnitudes and directions\nof applied shear. A PC running LabVIEW software ~Na-\ntional Instruments Corporation, Austin, TX! controlled im-\nage capture by the CCD camera and phase stepping.\nTo perform a measurement, reference images were re-\ncorded before object deformation and deformed images af-\nter object deformation. Initially, the shear was applied in\nthe horizontal x direction. The object was illuminated by\nthe laser and a reference DSP image was recorded with the\nshearing mirror blocked to prevent the formation of inter-\nferometric speckles. After unblocking the shearing mirror,\nthree reference shearography phase-stepped speckle inter-\nferograms were recorded, with phase steps of 22p\/3, 0,\nand 2p\/3 radians. The object was then deformed and a\nsingle deformed speckle interferogram was recorded at a\nphase step of 0 radians. The shearing mirror was again\nblocked and a deformed DSP was recorded. To record im-\nages from the vertical y shearing direction, the tilt of the\nshearing mirror was changed and the reference and de-\nformed interferogram image capture process was repeated.\nWrapped phase maps were calculated from the shearog-\nraphy interferograms as described in Eq. ~2! using the\nLabVIEW program. The wrapped phase maps were un-\nwrapped using ISTRA software23 ~Dantec-Ettemeyer\nGmbH, Ulm, Germany!. The unwrapped maps were con-\nverted to a measurement of strain using Eq. ~1!.

The direction of the arrow shows the results of the du\/dx and dv\/dx compo-\nnents and the results of the du\/dy and dv\/dy components.between 0 and 10000 microstrains. The rms error deter-\nmined was 6500 mm.\nFigure 4 shows the surface strain maps generated by\ncombining the data from the digital speckle photography\nand the shearography techniques. In Fig. 4~a! the du\/dx\nand dv\/dx in-plane displacement gradient components are\nrepresented by vectors, and the dw\/dx out-of-plane dis-\nplacement gradient component is represented by a color\nmap. In Fig. 4~b! the du\/dy and dv\/dy in-plane displace-\nment gradient components are represented by vectors, and\nthe dw\/dy out-of-plane displacement gradient component\nis represented by a color map. The in-plane displacement\ngradient vectors represent magnitudes of microstrains be-\ntween 500 and 2000 me. The out-of-plane displacement\ngradients are between 2400 and 1400 me.\n7 Discussion\nThe combined shearography and speckle pattern instrument\nhas been used successfully to fully characterize the surface\nstrain. For this experimental layout, the shearography tech-\nnique, with phase measurements made to 1\/10 fringe, has\nan accuracy of 620 me. The shearography technique has an\norder of magnitude greater sensitivity than the OFF tech-\nnique. The sensitivity of both techniques is suitable for the\ninvestigation of the mechanical properties of materials and\ncomponents.\nThe combined shearography and DSP technique is most\nuseful where the optical access is limited to a single illu-\nmination and viewing direction. This is particularly impor-\ntant when investigating surface strains within machinery\nand structures where optical access is compromised. The\ntechnique as presented is suitable for surface strain mea-\nsurements on flat surfaces normal to the instrument illumi-\nnation and viewing directions, as this is where the in-plane\nand out-of-plane direction vectors of the instrument coin-\ncide with the in-plane and out-of-plane direction vectors of\nthe object. When illumination and viewing at the normal to025602ineering\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 22 Jul 20the object surface is not possible, a coordinate transforma-\ntion would be required to obtain the orthogonal compo-\nnents.\nOne of the features of this instrument is the ability to\nperform independent measurements of the in-plane and out-\nof-plane displacement gradient components. This mini-\nmizes the propagation of errors in the calculations. For ex-\nample, when performing a multicomponent measurement\nusing multicomponent shearography alone, errors in one of\nthe measured channels can propagate to all the calculated\ncomponents in the coordinate transformation process.12\n8 Conclusions\nIn this work, a single-axis multicomponent surface strain\nmeasurement instrument is demonstrated. The technique\ncombines the speckle interferometry technique of shearog-\nraphy and the digital speckle photography technique of op-\ntical flow field. The full-surface strain measurement from a\nsingle illumination and viewing direction is demonstrated.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work is supported by the Engineering and Physical\nSciences Research Council, United Kingdom ~GR\/N11872\/\n01!, Augusta-Westland, the Civil Aviation Authority, United\nKingdom, and by the Royal Society, United Kingdom.\nReferences\n1.
