Introduction \nBiosensor technology has developed into an ever expanding and \nmultidisciplinary field since the Clark enzyme electrode was first reported \n(Clark and Lyons 1962). Biosensors generically offer simplified reagentless \nanalyses for a range of biomedical and industrial applications and for this \nreason this area has continued to develop into an ever expanding and \nmultidisciplinary field during the last couple of decades. Since more than half \nof the sensors reported in the literature are based on electrochemical \ntransducers (Meadows 1996) and at the time of writing approximately 85% of \nthe world commercial market for biosensors is for blood glucose monitoring \n(Newman et al 2002). \nWe have already within our laboratory demonstrated the fabrication of \nenzymatic and affinity based sensors that lend themselves to interrogation by \neither (i) amperometric or (ii) impedimetric approaches. Enzymatic sensors \nhave been developed for analytes including ethanol, oxalate and a series of \npesticides. Affinity sensors have been developed using antibody\/antigen and \nDNA hybridisation based approaches. These will all be reported in a series of \nfurther publications. \nA number of generic problems with biosensor technology however remain to \nbe overcome which if solved would allow greater practical expansion of the \nfield. One such problem involves removing the fluctuations in sensor responses \nthat are sometimes experienced with variations in convection caused by \nvariable flow or stirring\/agitation within an analyte sample. It has been \nunderstood for several decades that microelectrodes experience unique \nhemispherical diffusional profiles, and can impart stir-independent \ncharacteristics to electrochemical sensors employing microelectrodes as \nworking electrodes as well as offering faster response times. Microelectrodes \ncan moreover, often be used in high resistance media due to the low \noperational currents typically encountered. \n 2\n Individual microelectrodes offer very small responses and one approach for \novercoming this problem is to use many microelectrodes together in the form \nof an array to allow a cumulative and so larger response to be measured. \n \nMicroelectrode arrays may be fabricated by a number of approaches although \ntechniques such as photolithography or laser ablation have to date proved cost \nprohibitive for the mass production of disposable sensor strips. We have \npreviously described a novel sonochemical fabrication approach (Barton et al \n2004) for the production of microelectrodes, that lends itself to the mass \nproduction of sensor arrays. These microelectrode arrays were used to entrap \nglucose oxidase and then used in the detection of glucose. \n \nMany other workers have studied the immobilisation of enzymes (e.g. the \noxidases and dehydrogenases) within conducting polymers such as polyaniline \nor polypyrrole for use within sensors (Foulds and Lowe 1986, Shaolin et al \n1992). In our previous paper (Barton et al 2004) we described a technique that \nallows the co-deposition of glucose oxidase within the conducting polymer, \npolyaniline, at conducting microelectrode cavities to form \u201cmushroom\u201d shaped \nmicroelectrode protrusions. \n \nOne problem with this and many other sensor systems is a loss of signal \nlinearity at high glucose concentrations (>10 mM). We describe in this paper \nthe modification of a sonochemically fabricated microelectrode enzyme array \nvia the deposition of a polysiloxane coating and the improvement of signal \nlinearity. \n \n 3\n 2. Materials and Methods \nGlucose oxidase from Asperigillus niger (80% protein, 132,000 units\/g solid) \nwas purchased from the Sigma Chemical Company (Poole, Dorset, UK).  \nD-glucose, aniline, dichlorodimethylsiloxane, disodium hydrogen \northophosphate 12-hydrate, sodium dihydrogen orthophosphate 12-hydrate, \nsodium chloride and diaminobenzene dihydrochloride (all \u2018AnalaR\u2019 grade), \nwere purchased from BDH (Poole, Dorset, UK). All chemicals were used \nwithout further purification.  \n \nThe electrode substrates, Fig. 1(a), were purchased within the UK from \nSycopel Scientific and were produced within the Czech Republic by Krecji \nEngineering Inc.  The ceramic based substrate electrodes used within this study \nare designed so as to act as generic disposable templates that may be easily \nadapted for a range of differing applications. The electrodes possessed screen \nprinted gold working and counter electrodes with an Ag\/AgCl reference \nelectrode. \n \n2.1 Thin Film Deposition. \nThe deposition of microarrays of polyaniline in sonochemically ablated \npolydiaminobenzene films has been described in detail elsewhere (Barton et al \n2004) and will only be described here briefly. Polydiaminobenzene was \ndeposited from aqueous solution onto the electrodes and sonicated for 20 \nseconds. Polyaniline was grown electrochemically from a solution containing \nGOD, which led to the enzyme being entrapped in the polymer film. \n \nDimethyldichlorosilane, 0.5 ml, was placed in a watch glass at the bottom of a \nsealed reaction vessel kept at atmospheric humidity. A stage was designed to \nallow for the deposition of the polysiloxane directly at the working electrode \nsurface, Fig. 1(b), thereby ensuring that the counter and reference electrodes, \nand all the electrode contacts were not exposed to the silane vapour.  The \nelectrode was held in the stage, exposing one side only, and was suspended 5 \ncm above the dichlorodimethylsiloxane liquid for pre-determined periods.  The \nstage was then removed from the vessel and the electrode stored in a petri dish. \n 4\n  \n2.2 Electrochemical Characterisation. \nAll electrodes were connected to a potentiostat for electrochemical studies. A \nSycopel PCI-100 MK3 Potentiostat computer interface was used in conjunction \nwith a \u2018Ministat Potentiostat\u2019, H.B. Thompson and Associates, (Newcastle-\nupon-Tyne) for all electrochemical studies: current\/charge transients were \nrecorded using either an IBM compatible PC, or an Omniscribe X-T chart \nrecorder, Houston Instruments, Belgium.  AC impedance measurements were \nperformed using a ACM Auto AC DSP frequency response analyser and \npotentiostat linked to an IBM compatible PC. \n \nA Philips XL30 FEG SEM was used for all scanning electron microscopy.  \n 5\n3. Results and Discussion. \nSonochemical ablation of insulating films, followed by electropolymerisation \nof aniline gives a structure in which the insulating film serves as a support for \nan array of polyaniline microelectrodes (Barton et al 2004).  \n \nPrevious work within this group has been focussed towards the development \nand exploitation of ultra-thin film composite membrane technology for the \nconstruction of microelectrodes. A technique for depositing \npolymethylsiloxane from dichlorodimethylsiloxane has been previously shown \nby us to give thin films which offer low diffusional resistance to glucose but \nwhich minimise surface biofouling (Myler et al 2002), offer protection against \nelectrode passivation effects and allow the linearisation of sensor responses. \nPermittivity coefficients were measured for these films (Myler et al 2002) and \nshowed a much higher permeability for oxygen than for glucose, this is \nimportant because oxygen is a co-factor in the glucose-glucose oxidase \nreaction and we do not wish it to become depleted at the electrode surface and \ncause the sensor to reach saturation. \n \nWe believed, that the performance of the disposable enzyme electrode could be \ndeveloped further via the inclusion of a covering ultra-thin polymer film \ncoating, and this forms the base of this paper.  In this way it is possible that the \nresponse of the sensor may be linearised in order to extend the useful working \nrange in which the sensor may operate whilst also imparting some enhanced \nsurface biocompatibility.  Polysiloxane was chosen as the most suitable \nultra-thin polymer film coating since the condensation polymerisation method \nallows formation of a homogeneous thin-film across the entire exposed surface, \nwithout the need for a conductive host surface as previously demonstrated \n(Myler et al 2002). \n \nAn SEM image of the working electrode, Fig. 2(a), reveals a granulated surface \nstructure at this magnification, characteristic of the deposition of the \nconducting gold particles within the screen printed inks used (Reimer 1988).  \nPolydiaminobenzene was first electrochemically deposited onto the working \nelectrode surface, Fig. 2(b), and then sonicated for 20s in a similar manner to \n 6\nthe procedure developed and described earlier (Barton et al 2004).  SEM \nimages of the polymer film following sonication, Fig. 2(c), again show \nevidence of the polymer cavitation and thus microelectrode formation.  \n \nElectrodes of this type were evaluated for stir dependant \/ independent \ncharacteristics for the reduction of Fe(CN)63- in a similar manner to earlier \ninvestigations (Barton et al 2004), by comparing the amperometric response \nunder agitated (stirred) or quiet (non-stirred) solutions.  These investigations \nagain confirmed that under these conditions, the arrays formed upon the \ncommercial substrates exhibited true stir independent and were therefore \nconcordant with true microelectrode behaviour. This factor is important for \nsensors that would be used in \u2018real\u2019 situations such as in vivo where variations \nin blood flow might be anticipated. \n \nGlucose oxidase \/ polyaniline microelectrodes were then electrochemically \ndeposited via a cyclic voltammetric approach (Barton et al 2004) at the cavities \nresulting from the sonochemical ablation of the insulating polydiaminobenzene \nfilm.  Voltammogram corresponding to this deposition polymerisation were \nobtainied similar to those in our previous paper (Barton et al 2004) showing \nsteady deposition of polyaniline\/glucose oxidase at the cavities in the \npolydiaminobenzene film.  \n \nAn SEM of the working electrode, Fig. 3(a), clearly shows one of the resulting \npolymer \/ enzyme protrusions. SEM images of the siloxane coated enzyme \nmicroelectrodes are shown in Fig. 3(b). \n \nA film can be seen to cover the entire electrode surface and previous work by \nthis group has shown that polysiloxane films give enhanced biocompatibility \n(Myler et al 2002). \n \nIn order to assess the performance of the ultra-thin film as a coating for the \nlinearisation of sensor responses, the ac response to glucose of an enzyme \nmicroelectrode array \/ ultra-thin polymer film was compared to that of a similar \nelectrode lacking an ultra-thin polymer film coating.  \n 7\n AC impedimetric responses were determined over a range of frequencies from \n0.1 Hz-10 kHz. Again the responses were verified to be free of stirring \n(enforced convectional) effects. The Bode and Nyquist plots were almost \nidentical to those in our previous paper (Barton et al 2004) and therefore are \nnot shown for brevity. Earlier work showed that the greatest variations in \nimpedance occurred at 0.1 Hz (Barton et al 2004) and similar results were \nobtained for the siloxane coated membranes. When the differences in \nimpedance at frequency of 0.1 Hz are plotted for microelectrodes exposed to \nvarying glucose concentrations (compared to samples in pH 7.4 buffer \ncontaining no glucose), a calibration plot can be obtained, Fig. 3(c). \n \nThe instrumentation required for commercial exploitation of biosensors may be \ngreatly simplified if the sensor gives a linear response with respect to analyte \nconcentration. The resulting calibration graph, Fig. 3(c) shows that the siloxane \ncoating lowers the magnitude of sensor response compared to uncoated \nmicroelectrodes whilst also linearising the sensor responses  between 0-60 mM \nglucose (r2 = 0.671 [uncoated], r2 = 0.995 [silane coated]). We have determined \nboth here and in previous work (Barton et al 2004) the reproducibility of sensor \nresponses to be <5% variability in a series of trials. \n \n 8\n4. Conclusions \nThis paper has successfully demonstrated how two disparate biosensor \ntechnologies may be combined to form a novel enzyme-based electrochemical \nsensor. \n \nInitially we described the examination of a commercially available ceramic \nbased disposable electrode as a suitable host for the fabrication of a \nmicroelectrode array.  Upon coating the working electrode with the insulating \npolymer polydiaminobenzene, microelectrode arrays were fabricated via a \nsonochemical fabrication; these arrays again displayed true stir independent \nresponses. \n \nAs the electrode substrate had displayed suitability for microelectrode \nfabrication, enzyme \/ polymer protrusions were then again electrochemically \ndeposited (Barton et al 2004) at the host microelectrode templates so as to \nproduce an enzyme (glucose oxidase) ultra-microelectrode array. \n \nEnzyme microelectrode arrays were then coated with an ultra-thin film coating \nof polysiloxane (silicone) so as to provide a covering substrate diffusion \nlimiting layer for the linearisation of sensor responses. This coating has been \nshown to extend the useful analytical concentration range for the sensor via \nlinearisation of its response. \n \n 9\n5.
