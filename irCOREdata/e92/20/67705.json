The geomagnetic response to the passage of a\ncoronal mass ejection (CME) is studied. The passage of\nthe CME resulted in a storm sudden commencement\n(SSC) at 2243 UT on March 20 1990 with disturbed\nmagnetic activity during the following 24 h. The auro-\nral, sub-auroral and equatorial magnetic response to the\nsouthward turning at 1314 (\u008b5) UT on March 21 and\nthe equatorial response to the southward turning\nassociated with the SSC on 20 March are discussed in\nterms of existing models. It is found that the auroral and\nsub-auroral response to the southward turning associ-\nated with the SSC is a factor 2 or more quicker than\nnormal due to the shock in the solar wind dynamic\npressure. The low-latitude response time to the south-\nward turning, characterised by Dst and the magneto-\npause current corrected Dst*, is una\u0080ected by the shock.\nDst and Dst*, characteristic of the equatorial magnetic\nfield, responded to the 1314 (\u008b5) UT southward turning\nprior to the first observed substorm expansion phase\nonset, suggesting that a dayside loading process was\nresponsible for the initial enhancement in the ring\ncurrent rather than nightside particle injection. The\nresponse time of the auroral and sub-auroral magnetic\nfield to the southward turning at 1314 (\u008b5) UT on\nMarch 21 is measured at a variety of longitudes and\nlatitudes. The azimuthal propagation velocity of the\nresponse to the southward turning varied considerably\nwith latitude, ranging from \u00188 km s)1 at 67\u00b0N to \u00184 km\ns)1 at 55\u00b0N. The southward velocity of the equatorward\nboundary of the northern polar convection pattern has\nbeen measured. This velocity was \u00181.2 km s)1 at 1600\nMLT, although there was evidence that this may vary at\ndi\u0080erent local times.\n1 Introduction\nWhen the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) is south-\nward, reconnection between the IMF and geomagnetic\nfield occurs. Magnetic flux is eroded from the dayside of\nthe magnetopause and loaded into the lobes of the\nmagnetotail. Reconnection then takes place in the\nmagnetotail, returning closed flux to the inner magne-\ntosphere. These two processes result in a twin cell\nconvection pattern of plasma flow over the polar caps\nwhich maps down into the ionosphere (Dungey, 1961).\nReconnection at the noon magnetopause primarily\ndrives the dayside convection with the nightside con-\nvection dominated by tail reconnection associated with\nthe substorm expansion phase (e.g. Lockwood et al.,\n1990). The excitation of ionospheric convection follow-\ning a southward turning in the IMF is not instanta-\nneous. It has been demonstrated that the nightside\nionosphere can take \u001840 min to respond to a change in\nIMF-Bz at the magnetopause (e.g. Lester et al., 1993)\ncompared with only \u001810 min near noon (e.g. Etemadi et\nal., 1988; Todd et al., 1988). These ionospheric responses\noccurred prior to the onset of the first substorm\nexpansion phases and thus represent the ionospheric\nresponse to the dayside loading process, which Bargatze\net al. (1985) had previously measured to be an average\nof \u001820 min by a linear filter analysis. Cowley and\nLockwood (1992) described these delays in terms of a\nnon-circular distortion of the polar cap equatorward of\nthe pre-existing dayside reconnection line as magnetic\nflux is newly opened at the cusp. In this model there is a\nrelaxation time, following a burst in reconnection, in\nwhich the distorted polar cap returns to a more circular\nshape and it is this relaxation of the polar cap, ratherCorrespondence to: J. R. Taylor\nAnn. Geophysicae 15, 671\u2013684 (1997) \u00d3 EGS \u2013 Springer-Verlag 1997\nthan the solar wind flow, which drives the ionospheric\nflow in the polar cap. By considering typical ionospheric\nflow speeds and estimating the equatorward extent of\nthe dayside polar cap bulge, Cowley and Lockwood\n(1992) estimated that such a relaxation time would be\n\u001815 min, similar to the maximum time for the dayside\nionosphere to respond to changes in the IMF (Etemadi\net al., 1988; Todd et al., 1988). Similarly, during tail\nreconnection open flux is destroyed poleward of the\nreconnection line resulting in a distorted polar cap,\nwhich again will relax into a more circular configuration\ngenerating ionospheric flow. With a rapid succession of\nreconnection bursts the process of relaxation will be\ncontinuous, with southward reconnection related flow\nceasing some 15 min after the final reconnection burst in\nthe cusp or tail. This expansion or contraction of the\npolar cap would then excite auroral and sub-auroral\nreturn flow by compressional and rarefactional waves.\nAlthough convection models have included the return\nflow, these models have primarily been concerned with\npolar cap flow and have not considered the temporal\nresponse (e.g. Moses et al., 1987, 1989).\nThe substorm cycle, in addition to generating an\nenhanced twin cell convection pattern of plasma at\nauroral and sub-auroral latitudes, also results in en-\nhancement of the ring current as high energy particles\nare injected into the Van-Allen radiation belts (Schulz\nand Lanzerotti, 1974). A magnetic storm will result if\nsu\u0081cient particles are injected to significantly build up\nthe ring current, although the ring current energy\nthreshold of a storm, characterised by the Dst magnetic\nindex, is somewhat arbitrary (e.g. Gonzalez et al., 1994).\nA topic of current interest is the mechanism by which\nthe ring current is enhanced. A traditional view has been\nthat a magnetic storm is simply a summation of a\nsuccession of substorms (see e.g. Nishida, 1978). How-\never, recent evidence has suggested that the relationship\nbetween substorm particle injection events and the\nenhancement of the ring current is non-linear. For\nexample, Iyemori (1994) observed a decrease in the ring\ncurrent energy following substorm expansion phase\nonsets. Mechanisms have been suggested in which the\nring current may become enhanced without particle\ninjection events occurring, such as the acceleration of\nthe previously existing trapped particle population at\nL \u0015 4 via inward radial displacement resulting from an\nenhanced convection electric field (Lyons and Williams,\n1980; Gonzalez et al., 1994).\nIn this study we consider the geomagnetic response to\nthe extreme solar wind and IMF conditions during the\nmagnetic storm of March 20\u201321 1990. This interval has\nbeen selected for detailed study as part of the Coupling,\nEnergetics and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions\n(CEDAR) storm campaign (e.g. Buonsanto and Foster,\n1993). The ionospheric convection during the storm is\nthe subject of an earlier paper (Taylor et al., 1994b,\nhenceforth referred to as paper 1). Paper 1 studied the\nhigh latitude electric field through ionospheric convec-\ntion measurements. The ionospheric radar network\nallowed the study of small scale spatial structures. With\nonly a handful of radars, however, studies of global\ntemporal response were limited. In this work we study\nthe E region Hall currents inferred from ground\nmagnetograms. The parameter measured in the new\nstudy is less precise than the electric field studied in\npaper 1, since the ionospheric current is dependent upon\nboth the electric field and ionospheric conductivity. The\nlarge number of magnetometer stations which are\ndistributed globally does, however, allow detailed study\nof the magnetic response to variations of the solar wind\nand IMF. Furthermore, the large number of low-\nlatitude magnetometer stations available for the present\nstudy allowed the construction of a high time and spatial\nresolution Dst index with 14 stations, rather than the\nstandard 4, contributing to each 5 min value. This\nderived Dst index facilitated study of the low-latitude\nmagnetic response to changes in the IMF to investigate\nthe roles of day and nightside processes on the growth of\nthe ring current.\nTwo intervals of particular interest were selected for\ndetailed study in paper 1. The first interval comprised a\nstorm sudden commencement (SSC) at 2243 UT on\nMarch 20 and the subsequent 7 h of disturbed iono-\nspheric and magnetic activity. The second interval began\nwith the resumption of the recording of the IMF and\nsolar wind plasma data at \u00181100 UT on March 21 and\ncontinued until the spacecraft crossed the bow shock at\n\u00182100 UT. This second interval included a southward\nturning of the IMF at the subsolar magnetopause at\n1314 (\u008b5) UT.\nThe SSC on March 20 resulted from the passage of a\nshock front in the solar wind simultaneous with a\nsouthward turning of the IMF. In paper 1 the nightside\nionospheric response to the southward turning at the\nsubsolar magnetopause associated with the SSC was\nfound to be over twice as fast as the response to a\nsouthward turning measured at similar local times by\nLester et al. (1993), but similar to the dayside response\ntimes recorded in previously published work (e.g.\nEtemadi et al., 1988; Todd et al., 1988). Paper 1 also\nconsidered the dayside ionospheric response times to the\nsouthward turning at 1314 (\u008b5) UT at the subsolar\nmagnetopause on March 21. The measured ionospheric\nconvection response times were a factor \u00182 greater than\nthose presented by Etemadi et al. (1988) and Todd et al.\n(1988). By comparing the latitudes at which ionospheric\nflows were measured in each study, paper 1 concluded\nthat the response time of the ionosphere increased by\nbetween 1 min and 2 min per degree of equatorward\nlatitude.\nThis work supplements paper 1 by studying the low-\nlatitude (equatorial) magnetic response time to the\nsouthward turning associated with the SSC on March\n20 and considers separately the low-(equatorial) and\nhigh-(auroral and sub-auroral) latitude magnetic re-\nsponse times during the initial substorm growth phases\nfollowing the southward turning at 1314 (\u008b5) UT on 21\nMarch. The time of low-latitude magnetic response,\nmeasured by changes in Dst and the magnetopause\ncurrent corrected Dst*, is compared to the onset times of\nsubstorm expansion phases to investigate possible\nenhancement of the ring current by dayside reconnec-\n672 J. R. Taylor et al.: The response of the magnetosphere to the passage of a coronal mass\ntion processes. The high-latitude magnetic response\ntimes to the southward turning at 1314 UT on 21\nMarch, characterised by auroral and sub-auroral mag-\nnetograms, are studied at a range of local times and\nlatitudes to quantify meridional and azimuthal propa-\ngation velocities of magnetic perturbations.\n2 Instrumentation\nThe solar wind and IMF conditions during the interval\nunder study were monitored by the IMP-8 spacecraft.\nThe IMF data have been averaged over 15 s and the\nsolar wind plasma data between 60 s and 300 s. There is\na gap in the available data between \u00180200 UT and\n\u00181100 UT on March 21. Taylor et al. (1996) employed\nthese data to compute 5 min averages of the IMF at the\nsubsolar magnetopause adopting the method described\nby Lester et al. (1993). Lester et al. (1993) assumed that\nthe measurement at the spacecraft was representative of\na phase front at some angle, \/, to the Earth Sun line.\nThey then calculated the delay between the measure-\nment at the IMP-8 spacecraft and the time that this\nphase front would have been incident at the subsolar\nbow shock. Lester et al. (1993) then assumed that the\nsubsolar magnetosheath velocity fell approximately\nlinearly from msw\/4 at the bow shock down to approx-\nimately zero at the subsolar magnetopause (Spreiter and\nStahara, 1980). Taylor et al. (1996) utilised the empirical\nmodels described by Ne\u02c7mec\u02c7ek and S\u02c7afra\u00b4nkova\u00b4 (1991),\nbased on relations derived by Spreiter et al. (1979), to\ncalculate the positions of the subsolar magnetopause\nand bow shock. In the present study we employ the IMF\ndata set of Taylor et al. (1996) and we also adopt their\nmethod to calculate 5 min averages of the solar wind\nplasma parameters present at the solar magnetopause.\nThese 5 min averages of the solar wind parameters are\nthen employed, in conjunction with 5 min averages of\nDst deduced by the assimilative mapping of ionospheric\nelectrodynamics (AMIE) procedure for this interval, to\ncalculate the magnetopause current corrected Dst*\n(discussed in Sect. 5). The Dst calculated by the AMIE\nprocedure, in addition to enhancing the temporal\nresolution of the o\u0081cial 1 h Dst index, also increases\nthe spatial coverage with 14 magnetometer stations,\nrather than 4, contributing to the final value thereby\nreducing the e\u0080ects of poor local time resolution. In\naddition to Dst, the AMIE procedure also calculated 5\nmin averages of the AL index which are also employed\nin this study as an indication of substorm activity.\nFigure 1 is a polar plot in IGRF magnetic co-\nordinates (IAGA, 1996) of the magnetometer stations\nemployed in this study at epoch 1990.25, an altitude 0 m\nand 000 UT. IGRF magnetic coordinates at this epoch\nand altitude are adopted throughout. In this study we\nconsider the magnetic response of two azimuthal chains\nof stations, at latitudes 67\u00b0N and 55\u00b0N and two\nmeridional chains of stations at \u00180230 MLT and 1730\nMLT. The latitude and longitude of the chains selected\nwere determined by the available magnetometer stations\nwhich are a subset of the magnetometer chains detailed:\nthe CANOPUS array, situated in Canada, comprises 12\nfluxgate magnetometers with a sampling interval of 5 s\n(e.g. Rostoker et al., 1995); the United States Geological\nSurvey (USGS) magnetometer chain consists of 13\nfluxgate magnetometer stations situated in the USA,\nwith the data recorded at either 1 s or 5 s integration\ntimes (Herzog, 1992), although in this study 60 s\naverages of USGS data were available; the UK Sub-\nAuroral Magnetometer Network (SAMNET) consists\nof seven fluxgate magnetometer stations in the UK and\nScandinavia with a 5 s temporal resolution (Yeoman\net al., 1990); the EISCAT Magnetometer Cross (now\npart of the IMAGE network) comprises seven magne-\ntometer stations in northern Scandinavia with a 20 s\nintegration time (Lu\u00a8hr et al., 1984). In addition,\nanalogue plots from 5 Russian magnetometer stations\nare available, which have been digitised at a temporal\nresolution of 60 s.\n3 Solar wind and IMF\nHere we present a brief overview of the solar wind and\nIMF conditions during two intervals of interest during\nthe storm. A detailed discussion of the solar wind and\nIMF during the intervals can be found in paper 1.\nInterval 1 began at \u00182200 UT on March 20, when the\nIMP-8 spacecraft was upstream of the bow shock at\nGSE X, Y, Z co-ordinates of 18 RE, 24 RE and 4 RE\nFig. 1. Polar map illustrating the location, in magnetic local time and\nIGRF geomagnetic latitude, at 0000 UT, epoch 1990.25 and altitude 0\nm, of ground magnetometer stations employed in this study\ncomprising a chain of stations at 55\u00b0N (,), 67\u00b0N (\u0002) and at local\ntimes of ~0230MLT (n) and 1730 MLT (D) (more stations were used\nin the AMIE study). In this paper anH, D and Z co-ordinate system\nis adopted for ground magnetometer measurements. The H compo-\nnent is tangential to the Earth\u2019s surface and directed toward\ngeomagnetic north, the D component is perpendicular to the average\nmagnetic field and directed toward magnetic east and the Z\ncomponent is vertically downward. Each component was measured\nin nT\nJ. R. Taylor et al.: The response of the magnetosphere to the passage of a coronal mass 673\nrespectively. At 2240 UT there was a four fold increase\nin the solar wind pressure, Psw, to 20 nPa (Fig. 2b)\nresulting from an increase in both the solar wind\ndensity, qsw, and velocity, msw, (parameters not shown).\nThis increase was simultaneous with a three fold\nincrease in the IMF magnitude, Bt, and solar wind\ntemperature, Tsw, (parameters not shown) and also a\nsouthward turning in the IMF with Bz becoming )15 nT\nat 2330 UT (Fig. 2a). Bz remained primarily negative\nuntil just before the data gap at 0200 UT on March 21\nwith the last data recorded being positive. IMF By and\nBx (parameters not shown) oscillated about 0 nT,\nfollowing the shock. Bt, Tsw and Psw had decreased by\nthe data gap to \u001810 nT, 1.50 \u00b4 105 K and 8 nPa\nrespectively (although there was only one solar wind\nplasma datum following 0130 UT and prior to the data\ngap).\nThe start of interval 2 coincides with the time IMF\ndata recording recommenced at 1100 UT, March 21.\nThe IMF Z component turned negative at 1314 (\u008b5)\nUT, reaching )10 nT at \u00181400 UT and remaining\npredominantly negative until after the spacecraft had\ncrossed the bow shock into the magnetosheath at \u00182100\nUT (Fig. 3a). During this interval the solar wind\ndynamic pressure was comparatively stable at \u00185 nPa\nfalling o\u0080 to \u00182 nPa at the end of data recording\n(Fig. 3b) and the IMF By (not shown) was negative\nexcept for the interval between 1315 UT and 1500 UT.\nThe inferred phase front of the IMF and of the shock\nassociated with the SSC in relation to the location of the\nIMP-8 spacecraft and the modelled bow shock are\nillustrated in Fig. 4. The figure looks down upon the\nNorth Pole of the Earth with the bow shock dimensions\ndeduced from the empirical models of Ne\u02c7mec\u02c7ek and\nS\u02c7afra\u00b4nkova\u00b4 (1991) in the Z = 0 plane. Ne\u02c7mec\u02c7ek and\nS\u02c7afra\u00b4nkova (1991) utilised measurements of the bow\nshock position from a variety of spacecraft crossings\nand normalised these coordinates to a standardised solar\nwind pressure based on the hydrodynamic equilibrium\nbetween the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere and the solar wind\n(Spreiter et al., 1979). The modelled bow shock contours\nappear reasonable since the radius of the bow shock\nmeasured by the IMP-8 spacecraft as it crossed into the\nmagnetosheath at \u00182130 UT March 21 was 28 RE,\nconsistent with the predicted bow shock radius along the\nEarth\/IMP-8 line of 27 (\u008b1.5) RE.\nFig. 2a\u2013e.

Taylor et al.: The response of the magnetosphere to the passage of a coronal mass\nThe propagation time of an Alfve\u00b4n wave to travel\nfrom the modelled bow shock to the magnetopause and\nfinally to the ground was computed to be 7 (\u008b1) min.\nWith the ground signature of the SSC at 2243 UT the\nsolar wind shock would have been incident upon the\nmodelled bow shock at 2236 (\u008b1) UT. The inferred\nplane of propagation of the shock in the solar wind was\ndeduced by comparing the time that the shock was\nrecorded by IMP-8 (2246 UT) with the time that the\nshock would have been incident upon the modelled bow\nshock (2236 UT). The plane of propagation of the shock\nfront is at an angle of \u001845\u00b0 to the X axis. Since the shock\nis perpendicular to the average Parker spiral it is implied\nthat the discontinuity arises from temporal changes in\nthe expanding solar wind and IMF rather than spatial\nchanges (i.e. changes along solar longitude). A high\/low\nspeed stream interface (Burlaga, 1974; Gosling et al.,\n1978) would result in a discontinuity along the Parker\nspiral, whereas a coronal mass ejection (CME; Burlaga,\n1991) would more likely result in a discontinuity\nperpendicular to the averaged Parker spiral. The IMF\nand solar wind density and velocity signatures before\nand during the strom are characteristic of a CME,\nalthough the higher than ambient solar wind tempera-\nFig. 3a\u2013e.

Note the injection at 1820 UT was only present in proton flux data\nFig. 4. Schematic presenting the inferred geometry of the shock front\nassociated with the SSC at 2243 UT on March 20. The geometry of\nthe bow shock has been deduced from the empirical models of\nNe\u02c7mec\u02c7ek and S\u02c7afra\u00b4nkova\u00b4 (1991). See text for details. The plane of the\nshock reached the bow shock 10 min prior to detection by the IMP-8\nspacecraft\nJ. R. Taylor et al.: The response of the magnetosphere to the passage of a coronal mass 675\nture following the SSC is not entirely consistent with the\npassage of a CME (see, e.g., Burlaga, 1991; Lindsay\net al., 1994). This result is in agreement with the study of\nTaylor et al., (1994a) which suggested that SSCs are\nprimarily the result of the Earth passage of a CME,\nrather than a high\/low speed stream interaction, and\nthat the larger storms (i.e. Dst \u0014-100 nT for four\nconsecutive hours) are primarily caused by CMEs (see\nalso Gosling et al., 1991).\n4 Auroral and sub-auroral magnetic response\nWe begin our study of the geomagnetic response to the\nextreme solar wind conditions during the two intervals\nidentified earlier by considering the ground magnetic\nresponse at auroral and sub-auroral latitudes. Figure 5\npresents a summary of the magnetic H components\nobserved during interval 1 by ten ground magnetometer\nstations situated at a geomagnetic latitude of 55 (\u008b2)\u00b0N\nand ordered in increasing magnetic local time (MLT)\nwhich is indicated at the right of the record. The vertical\nlines in Fig. 5 indicate the time of the southward turning\n(longer dashes), the onset times of substorm expansion\nphases identified by characteristic bays in magnetometer\ndata and Pi2 pulsations (shorter bold dashes) a classic\nsignature of a substorm expansion phase onset,\n(Rostoker et al., 1980), and electron or proton particle\ninjection events identified by the LANL spacecraft\n(dots) by the study of Yeoman et al., (1994). A sample\nof electron flux measured by LANL 1984-129 is\npresented in Fig. 2e. Where multiple substorm onsets\nhave taken place (determined by either Pi2 pulsations or\nLANL particle data) shaded boxes have been used to\nindicate the time range of these intensifications. AT 2243\nUT all stations recorded a storm sudden commence-\nment. The largest increase in the H component of 200\nnT occurred at NEW (\u00181400 MLT), with the magnitude\nof the SSC slowly decreasing toward magnetic midnight.\nStations on the dawnside, YAK (\u00180700 MLT) and\nMGD (\u00180800 MLT) recorded decreases in the H\ncomponent of 65 nT and 50 nT respectively with\npolarity reversal in the H component occurring between\nYAK (0730 MLT) and BOX (0130 MLT) and probably\nclose to 0500 MLT since POD observed no response in\nthe H component.\nFigure 6a presents the ground magnetic response in\nthe H component for the same 10 stations located near\nFig. 5.a,b Ground magnetometer plots of sub-auroral stations (at\n\u001855\u00b0N) for interval 1, 2200 UT March 20 to 0700 UT March 21\npresenting the SSC at 2243UT (- - - - -) for theH component. Substorm\nexpansion phase onsets identified from Pi2 waves from CANOPUS,\nSAMNET and EISCAT Magnetometer Cross data and additional\nexpansion phase onsets identified from bays in data from Russian and\nEuropean stations are also shown (\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 ) in addition to expansion\nphase onsets determined from LANL particle data (\u00e1 \u00e1 \u00e1 \u00e1 \u00e1).

As for Fig. 5 except presenting the magnetic variation\nfor interval 2: 1200 UT to 2400 UT March 21, including the 1314\n(\u008b5) UT southward turning (ST) at the magnetopause (- - - - -) for\na H and b D components for the 55\u00b0N chain and c H component\nfor the 67\u00b0N chain. The magnetic local time is stated for each\nstation at the time of the southward turning\nJ. R. Taylor et al.: The response of the magnetosphere to the passage of a coronal mass 677\n55\u00b0N as Fig. 5 during interval 2 (1200 UT to 2400 UT,\nMarch 21). All stations recorded a resumption of\ndisturbed magnetic activity following the southward\nturning which arrived at the subsolar magnetopause at\n1314 (\u008b5) UT. The \u008b 5 min error in the time at which\nthe IMF was incident upon the subsolar magnetopause\narises from uncertainties in the angle of the IMF\ndiscontinuity phase front and uncertainty in the location\nof the subsolar bow shock and magnetosheath. The\nlargest perturbations in the H components were record-\ned by the western European stations (e.g. KVI),\nalthough little disturbance was visible in the D compo-\nnents of these stations (Fig. 6b). To measure the\nresponse times of the magnetic activity to the southward\nturning, a quiet day level was first subtracted from each\nstation. A threshold of \u0006j20\u00ff 30j nT in the horizontal\nplane (which was dominated by the north-south com-\nponent) was adopted to indicate the onset of activity\nfollowing the 1314 (\u008b5) UT southward turning at the\nsubsolar magnetopause, with error bars determined by\nthe upper and lower limits of this threshold. This chosen\nthreshold is approximately half the total quiet day\nvariation measured by magnetometer stations in this\nchain. The measured response times, summarised in\nFig. 7 (square plot symbols), ranged from 19 (\u008b5) min\nat GML (\u00181400 MLT) to 55 (\u008b6) min at MGD (\u00182400\nMLT). These errors do not include the uncertainty (\u008b5\nmin) in the time at which the IMF discontinuity was\nincident upon the subsolar magnetopause which is\ncommon to all measurements. The response times to\nthe southward turning of the IMF of nine stations\ncentred on 67\u00b0N (Fig. 6c) has also been studied. For this\nhigher latitude chain a threshold of \u0006j40\u00ff 50j nT was\nadopted as the onset of activity. A 2 mHz low pass filter\nwas applied to remove high frequency components\npresent before and after the southward turning. The\nhigher thresholds successfully eliminated the higher\namplitude noise without significantly a\u0080ecting the mea-\nsured delays of the underlying response. These response\ntimes for the 67\u00b0N chain are also summarised in Fig. 7\n(solid diamond plot symbols) and range from 16 (\u008b1)\nmin at LRV (\u00181430 MLT) to 43 (\u008b2) min at\nTIK (\u00182200 MLT). Again these errors do not include\nthe 5 min uncertainty in the time that the southward\nturning was incident upon the subsolar magnetopause.\nTo study latitudinal variations, two meridional\nchains of seven stations centred near 1600 MLT and\n0700 MLT at 1314 UT on March 21 are considered. The\n1600 MLT chain, which comprises mainly EISCAT\nMagnetometer Cross stations, ranges from NUR (part\nof the SAMNET array) at 56.6\u00b0N to SOR at 67.0\u00b0N\n(Fig. 1, D plot symbols) and the 0700 MLT chain, which\ncomprises a subset of the CANOPUS magnetometer\nchain, ranges from PIN at 61.5\u00b0N to RAN at 73.25\u00b0N\n(Fig. 1, C plot symbols). A quiet day was again\nsubtracted, with a threshold of \u0006j40\u00ff 50j nT once\nmore adopted for both meridian chains. A 2 mHz Low\npass filter was applied to remove high frequency\ncomponents present before and after the southward\nturning. The measured response times for the 1600 MLT\nchain varied from 17 (\u008b5) min at SOR increasing with\ndecreasing latitude to 32 (\u008b1) min at NUR (Fig. 8,\nsquare plot symbols). These errors, once more, do not\ninclude the \u008b 5 min temporal uncertainty in which the\nIMF phase front was incident upon the subsolar\nmagnetopause. The response times for the 0700 MLT\nchain ranged from 25 (\u008b5) min at RAN to 36 (\u008b5) min\nat PIN (Fig. 8, solid diamond plot symbols).\n5 Low-latitude magnetic response\nWe now consider the low-latitude magnetic response,\ncharacterised by the Dst magnetic index, to the extreme\nsolar wind conditions. Figures 2 and 3, in addition to\npresenting 5 min averages of the estimated IMF Bz and\nPsw at the subsolar magnetopause (Figs. 2a, 2b, 3a and\n3b), include 5 min averages of Dst (third panels, solid\nline). This Dst has been calculated from the AMIE\nprocedure employing twelve Northern and 2 Southern\nFig. 7.

The stations are weighted\nby the longitudinal distance from their neighbours so as\nto obtain a balanced Dst with greater longitudinal data\ncoverage, which should minimise errors such as a\npossible diurnal bias associated with the partial ring\ncurrent (Mayaud, 1980). Furthermore, the higher tem-\nporal resolution allows study of fine-scale structures\nsuch as the positive peak in Dst at 2245 UT (Fig. 2c)\nwhich reached only )40 nT in the o\u0081cial low resolution\nDst but was +5 nT in the high resolution Dst. The\nbroken line in Fig. 2c is Dst* which is the estimated Dst\ncorrecting for magnetopause currents (proportional to\nPsw\n1\/2; e.g. Siscoe et al., 1968) and can be expressed as:\nDst\u0003 \u0088 Dst \u00ff bP 1=2sw \u0087 c \u00851\u0086\nwhere the coe\u0081cient b, determined empirically from\nsudden impulse (SI) events, is\u00180.2 nT\/(eV cm)3) or 1250\nT\/Pa and the quiet-time constant c is \u001820 nT (see, e.g.,\nBurton et al., 1975; Gonzalez et al., 1994) and references\ntherein). Siscoe and Crooker (1974) have demonstrated\nthat Dst* gives the total energy stored in the ring current\nto better than 20% even when the ring current is\nasymmetric. The vertical lines in Figs. 2 and 3 represent\nthe times of substorm expansion phase onsets deduced\nfrom ground magnetometer data (dashed lines) and\nparticle injection events deduced for this interval from\ngeosynchronous spacecraft data in the study of Yeoman\net al., (1994) (dotted lines) with shaded bars to indicate\nthe range during multiple onsets\/intensifications. As an\nindication of the strength of substorm activity, 5 min\naverages of the AL index (also calculated by the AMIE\nprocedure) are presented in Figs. 2d and 3d. Prior to the\nSSC at 2243 UT on March 20, Dst was relatively\nconstant at\u0018)45 nT. In response to the shock associated\nwith the SSC Dst rapidly increased by 50 nT, peaking at\nFig. 8.

R. Taylor et al.: The response of the magnetosphere to the passage of a coronal mass 679\n+5 nT at 2255 UT, the time of the first particle injection\nevent. Although the 2255 UT particle injection was\nidentified by strict criteria in the study of Yeoman et al.\n(1994), it is a small injection and the source of this\nsignature is unclear. Subsequent to 2255 UT Dst slowly\ndecreased reaching a minimum of )140 nT at 0120 UT,\nMarch 21. Dst*, however, exhibits a much smaller\npositive rise following the SSC, implying that most of\nthe initial rise in Dst is the result of enhanced\nmagnetopause currents acting to increase the dayside\nH magnetic component and hence increasing the\nmeasured Dst. The gaps in Dst* result from gaps in\nthe calculated Psw at the subsolar magnetopause which\nare a consequence of inferred rapid movement of the\nmagnetopause. There is evidence that Dst* decreased\njust prior to the SSC. The calculated value of Psw at the\nsubsolar magnetopause rose in the 5 min interval\ndirectly prior to the SSC. There is uncertainty in the\ncalculated delay to the magnetopause following the\ndetection of the shock front by the IMP-8 spacecraft.\nThis uncertainty implies that the decrease in Dst* during\nthat 5 min interval is a consequence of this temporal\nerror. After the positive rise associated with the SSC,\nboth Dst and Dst* vary in a similar manner.\nFollowing the southward turning at 1314 (\u008b5) UT on\nMarch 21, Dst was stable at \u0018)90 nT (Fig. 3c).\nCommencing from 1355 UT Dst slowly decreased,\nreaching )100 nT at 1415 UT, the time of the first\nsubstorm expansion phase onset. Dst then decreased\nmore rapidly reaching )110 nT at 1425 UT, before\nlevelling o\u0080. From 1540 UT Dst slowly increased with a\npeak of )90 nT at 1930 UT before slowly decreasing\nonce more. The variation of Dst* following the south-\nward turning was very similar, initially being o\u0080set by\n)15 nT from Dst. Dst* does, however, exhibit a positive\nstep at 1315 UT which was in response to a sharp\ndecrease in Psw from 7 nPa to 5.5 nPa, which the raw\nsolar wind data demonstrated to occur on a time scale of\nless than 2 min. This decrease in Psw resulted in a cavity\noscillation of the magnetosphere which was observed as\n3 mHz waves in the backscatter intensity measured by\nthe Wick (Nielsen et al., 1983) coherent radar (see e.g.\nYeoman and Lester, 1990), but was not manifest in Dst.\nThere is evidence of a decrease in Dst* from 1330 UT\nwith a smaller negative gradient than Dst itself following\nthe substorm at 1414 UT. By 1830 UT, the onset of a\ndata gap in Psw, and during the subsequent interval\nfollowing the data gap, Dst and Dst* had converged to\nvery similar absolute values.\n6 Discussion\nWe begin by discussing the auroral and sub-auroral\nmagnetic response to the southward turning at the\nsubsolar magnetopause at 1314 (\u008b5) UT on 21 March\nduring interval 2. Figure 8 presents the measured\nresponse times for the two magnetometer chains roughly\nin a line of magnetic longitude at \u00181600 MLT (squares)\nand 0700 MLT (solid diamonds). Time t \u0088 0 is taken as\n1314 UT. For the 1600 MLT chain a clear latitudinal\ndependence is visible, with the shortest response time of\n\u001817 min at \u001867\u00b0N and the longest response time of \u001833\nmin at \u001857\u00b0N. A linear regression analysis provides a\ncorrelation coe\u0081cient, r, of 0.998. These results suggest\nthat the response time of E-region ionospheric currents\nto changes in the IMF-Bz increases by between 1 min\nand 2 min per degree of equatorward latitude. Such a\nvalue agrees with the latitudinal dependency deduced in\npaper 1 by comparing measured ionospheric flow\nresponse times to the southward turning in this interval\nwith response times measured in earlier studies at similar\nlocal times but at higher latitudes. The chain at 0700\nMLT also exhibits a latitudinal dependence, although\nthere are larger uncertainties in the measured response\ntimes. The linear regression analysis suggests an increase\nof \u00180.8 min for each degree of equatorward latitude\n(r = 0.83). With such large uncertainties in response\ntimes at 0700 MLT, however, lines with gradients in the\nrange 0.2\u20131.6 min degree)1 may be drawn through the\ndata within the error bars and it is this range which we\nadopt in this work. Since the error bars represent the\ntime taken for the field to change between 40 nT to 50\nnT, the size of the error bars are indicative of the time\nscale on which the magnetic field changed.\nResponse times measured from the two chains of\nmagnetometer stations at latitudes 55 (\u008b2)\u00b0N and 67\n(\u008b2)\u00b0N are presented in Fig. 7 (square and solid\ndiamond plot symbols respectively). A correction to\nthe measured propagation delays along the longitudinal\nchain of 1 min degree)1 from the centre of the latitude\nbands has been employed and included in Fig. 7. The\ncorrection is based on the minimum latitude dependence\nfrom the meridional results discussed already. A clear\ndiurnal variation is visible with dayside 55\u00b0N stations\nresponding on a time scale of between 20 min and 30\nmin (OTT, STJ, GML and KVI; 0900 MLT to 1500\nMLT), with response times increasing up to 60 min at\nnightside local times (NEW and VIC near 0600 MLT\nand YAK and MGD near 2300 MLT). A best fit second\norder polynomial suggests that the shortest response\ntimes occurred near 1400 MLT consistent with the\ndisplacement of the dayside merging gap for positive By\ndescribed by Cowley et al. (1991). These results are also\nin agreement with the minimum response times mea-\nsured by Todd et al. (1988) and Etemadi et al. (1988) in\nwhich the shortest response times were observed post\nnoon, although By e\u0080ects were not considered in these\nstudies.\nThe 67\u00b0N chain exhibits similar variations (Fig. 7,\nsolid diamond plot symbols) ranging from \u001817 min near\n1400MLT (LRV) to 30 min near 0400 MLT (DAW) and\n\u001840 min near 2200 MLT (TIK). Although the magnetic\nresponse time at TIK (latitude 67\u00b0N) is in a similar range\nto that at YAK (latitude 55\u00b0N; both near 2230 MLT) a\nhigher threshold was employed in determining the onset\nof activity for the 67\u00b0N latitude range. In addition,\nconvection patterns deduced by the AMIEmodel suggest\nthat TIK was in the region of the Harang discontinuity,\npossibly delaying its response as the magnetometer\nstation moved between convection cells. Employing a\nlatitudinal correction of delay (min)=1.6D(co-latitude)\n680 J. R. Taylor et al.: The response of the magnetosphere to the passage of a coronal mass\nand allowing 3 min for the southward turning signal to\npropagate to ground level from the subsolar magneto-\npause (based on half the time period of the cavity\noscillation observed in Wick radar data) would put the\ndayside reconnection line at 76(\u008b4)\u00b0N at 1314 UT when\nflux was first loaded on the dayside following the\nsouthward turning. Subsequently, the reconnection line\nwould move equatorward as open magnetic flux was\nadded to the polar cap.\nFigure 9 summarises the measured variations in the\nresponse times in terms of propagation velocities, mu.\nmu \u0088 4s=s \u00852\u0086\nwhere Ds is the distance along a line of latitude or\nlongitude in which the response signal travels in time s.\nThese propagation velocities, which have all been\nmeasured in regions of return ionospheric convection\nflow rather than the polar cap flow, vary considerably\nwith both longitude and latitude. Assuming that the\nminimum response time is near 1400 MLT (as suggested\nby the second order polynomial fit) these measured\ndelays translate into propagation velocities of 3.9\n(\u008b0.7) km s)1 at 55\u00b0N and 5.1 (\u008b2.4) km s)1 at 67\u00b0N\nwith correlation coe\u0081cients r55=0.92 and r67=0.6\nrespectively. These velocities are calculated by employ-\ning linear regression for both Ds=f(s) and s=f(Ds) with\nthe two gradient representing the upper and lower\nvelocity limits. The value of mu at latitude 67\u00b0 of 5.1\n(\u008b2.4) km s)1 is based on linear regression of the\nresponse time for all 9 stations at that latitude. As\ndiscussed earlier, however, it is possible that TIK was\ntransient between convection cells and may therefore\nnot represent a true response to the southward turning.\nWithout TIK, mu at latitude 67\u00b0 increases from 5.1\n(\u008b2.4) km s)1 to 9.3 (\u008b1.6) km s)1 (r67=0.89). Propa-\ngation velocity mu at latitude 67\u00b0 is likely therefore to be\nin the range 6.8 (\u008b4.1) km s)1, and it is this value which\nis included in Fig. 9. AMIE patterns of the convection\nelectric field suggest that the polar cap covered \u001840\u00b0 of\nlatitude across the 1200\u20132400 UT meridian. If the signal\npropagation velocity over the polar cap was \u001810 km s)1,\nequivalent to the highest velocities measured, then the\nmost anti-sunward point on, and hence the whole of, the\npolar cap would respond on a time scale of \u001810 min.\nSuch a time scale is similar to the relaxation time of \u001815\nmin predicted by Cowley and Lockwood (1992). The\nvelocity mu along a line of latitude is strongly dependent\nupon the latitude with the velocity at 67\u00b0N twice that at\n55\u00b0N. Transforming the measured delays of the merid-\nian chains into propagation velocities suggests that near\n1600 MLT the signal propagated equatorward at 1.15\n(\u008b0.05) km s)1 compared with \u00182.35 (\u008b0.05) km s)1\nnear 0700 MLT based on the statistical fits. However,\ndue to the large uncertainties in the measured delays\nnear 0700 MLT, the velocity can be estimated to be in\nthe range 7.0 (\u008b5.8) km s)1 (see Fig. 9) and compared\nto 1.15 (\u008b0.05) km s)1 at 1600 MLT, it is not possible to\nrule out equal propagation velocities at both local times.\nThe equatorward propagation at both MLT meridians\nis of the order of the typical east-west flow speed\nmagnitudes observed away from the dayside flow\nreversal at that time, but more than four times the\nobserved southward flow components and the predicted\npolar cap boundary expansion velocity of \u0018300 m s)1\n(see paper 1). The equatorward propagation therefore\nrepresents a phase velocity of excited zonal plasma flow\nrather than equatorward movement of plasma.\nTo gain further understanding of the nature of these\ndelays it is instructive to consider the relationship\nbetween the magnetic responses discussed above with\nthe ionospheric convection considered in paper 1. The\ntwo meridional chains are approximately symmetrical\nabout local noon, yet they exhibit remarkably di\u0080erent\nresponses to the southward turning, with the magnetic\nfield near 0700 MLT changing more slowly (character-\nised by much larger error bars) than at 1600 MLT. The\n1600 MLT chain is, however, situated closer to the local\ntime where the minimum response time determined by\nthe second order polynomial fit to the 55\u00b0N latitudinal\nchain. Since both the ionospheric convection response\ntimes and the magnetic response times exhibit similar\nlatitudinal dependencies it is probable that these latitu-\ndinal variations represent the time taken for the\nconvection cell to expand down to the latitude of the\ncontributing stations. The E-region currents, character-\nised by ground magnetic field variations, are therefore\nlikely to represent changes in the electric field rather\nthan changes in conductivity, although both parameters\nmay be varying. Since the lower latitude boundary of the\nreturn flow expands southward at four times the rate of\nthe expanding polar cap boundary then the rate of\ngrowth of the return flow, driven by dayside reconnec-\ntion process alone, must exceed the rate of growth of the\npolar cap area. Additionally since the polar cap expands\nfaster than the local plasma speed the expansion rate\nmust represent propagation of a compressional (or\nrarefaction) pulse rather than the movement of plasma.\nWith the dayside reconnection site at 76 (\u008b4)\u00b0N, these\nFig. 9. Schematic summarising themeasured azimuthal andmeridion-\nal signal propagation velocities, mu, of the southward turning at the\nmagnetopause at 1314 (\u008b5) UT on March 21 1990 during interval 2\nJ. R. Taylor et al.: The response of the magnetosphere to the passage of a coronal mass 681\nresponse times thus measure the time to excite return\nflow. An interpretation of the slower response times at\n0700 MLT is that the morning convection cell in the\nNorthern Hemisphere was slower to start development\nfollowing the southward turning, possibly as a conse-\nquence of the large positive IMF-By. This suggestion is\nconsistent with convection patterns deduced for this\ninterval by the AMIE procedure which suggest that the\nmorning convection cell did not start developing until\n\u001830 min after the southward turning.\nMoving now to discuss the low latitude magnetic\nresponse characterised by Dst and the magnetopause\ncurrent corrected Dst*. Dst* exhibits a significantly\nreduced response to the initial impulse of the SSC in the\nfirst study interval compared to Dst iteself. Directly\nbefore the SSC, there was a steep negative gradient in\nDst* in addition to the data gaps directly after. The\ndecrease in Dst* results from a small temporal error in\nthe estimate of Psw at the subsolar magnetopause. Dst*\ndoes, however, suggest that the ring current is una\u0080ected\nby the shocked impact of the CME, but is enhanced\nshortly after by reconnection processes related to the\nlarge negative Bz. Extrapolating the gradients of Dst*\nbefore and after the SSC indicates that Dst* responded\nat 2305 UT. With Dst falling rapidly from 2255 UT we\nestimate that the ring current responded to IMF\nsouthward turning at 2300 (\u008b5) UT, coincident with\nthe first particle injection event. The southward turning\nassociated with the SSC was incident upon the subsolar\nmagnetopause at 2240 (\u008b1) UT (paper 1), resulting in\nthe response time of the ring current of 20 (\u008b6) min\n(including the \u008b 1 min uncertainty in the time that the\nsouthward turning was incident upon the subsolar\nmagnetopause). This time delay is presented in Fig. 10\n(shaded area) which also reproduces the ionospheric\ntime delays following the southward turning associated\nwith the SSC measured in paper 1. The low latitude\nmagnetic field responded on a time scale longer than the\nMillstone Hill radar (MMR) and digisonde (MHD;\nboth at \u00181800 MLT) and the Wick radar (at \u00180000\nMLT) which are all less than 12 min. The response is,\nhowever, consistent with the response time measured by\nthe EISCAT radar (at \u00180200 MLT) and coincident with\nthe first particle injection event identified from geosyn-\nchronous spacecraft data at 2255 UT although the\nsource of this injection signature is ambiguous (Fig. 2e)\nand may not be related to a substorm expansion phase.\nThe low-latitude magnetic field characterised by Dst and\nDst* responded after the dayside auroral ionosphere\nand was probably a consequence of nightside particle\ninjection enhancing the ring current during the initial\nsubstorm expansion phase.\nFollowing the southward turning of the IMF at\n1314(\u008b5) UT on 21 March, Dst* and Dst commenced\ndecreasing from 1330 UT and 1350 UT respectively\nindicating enhancement in the ring current prior to the\nfirst observed substorm expansion phase onset (Fig. 3c)\nfollowing the southward turning. Employing the method\ndescribed by Lester et al. (1983), ground magnetograms\nsuggest that the current system for the 1414 UT\nsubstorm expansion phase onset was centred between\nYAK and POD with both stations within the current\nwedge (Fig. 6a) with BOX and MGD either side of the\nwedge. The wedge would have therefore been within the\nrange 1700 MLT to 2400 MLT. The LANL spacecraft\nwhich measured the particle injection was located at\n\u00181900 MLT. The particle injection, observed in electron\nprecipitation data by the LANL 1984-129 spacecraft at\n1420 UT, was relatively dispersionless, with a maximum\ntime delay of 2 min over an energy range of 30-250 KeV.\nWith typical particle drift speeds ranging from 1.5-12\u00b0\nmin)1 for 30-250 KeV particles (Reeves et al., 1990,\n1991; Yeoman et al., 1994), a 2 min dispersion delay\nimplies a maximum delay of 30 s between the particle\ninjection and its measurement by the spacecraft in the\nhighest energy electron channels. These results suggest\nthat the ring current responded to the southward\nturning after 26 (\u008b15 min) consistent with the high-\nlatitude response time to the southward turning\nassociated with the SSC of 20 (\u008b6) min. The response\ntime of Dst\/Dst* to the southward turning at 1314 (\u008b5)\nUT on 21 March has been included in Fig. 7 (shaded\nFig. 10. Ionospheric response times to the\nsouthward turning as a function of MLT\nassociated with the SSC at 2240 (\u008b1) UT\nMarch 20 during interval 1, reproducing the\nresults of Taylor et al. (1994b) and including\nthe response time of Dst\/Dst* (shaded band)\n682 J. R. Taylor et al.: The response of the magnetosphere to the passage of a coronal mass\nband). The response time of this southward turning is of\nthe same order as the high-latitude dayside response, but\nprecedes the nightside high-latitude response and the\nfirst substorm expansion phase onset at 1414 UT by\nsome 25 to 45 min. These results suggest that the initial\nresponse to the 1314 (\u008b5) UT southward turning of the\nlow-latitude magnetic field, characterised by Dst and\nDst*, is a consequence of a dayside process, rather than\nparticle injection during the substorm expansion phase.\nOne possible mechanism is the acceleration of the pre-\nexisting trapped particle population at L \u0015 4 via inward\nradial displacement resulting from an enhanced convec-\ntion electric field (Lyons and Williams, 1980; Gonzalez\net al., 1994).\n7 Summary\nThis work has studied the ground magnetic response to\nthe extreme conditions in the solar wind energy input\nduring the magnetic storm of March 20\u201321 1990 at\nauroral, sub-auroral and low-magnetic latitudes. Al-\nthough the solar wind signature is not unambiguous, the\nstorm appears to have been the result of the Earth\npassage of a shocked CME rather than the interaction\nbetween high speed and slow speed streams in the solar\nwind. This is consistent with previous work which\nsuggests the storms which begin with a sudden com-\nmencement are primarily caused by CMEs.\nThe high-latitude magnetic response times to the\n1314 (\u008b5) UT, 21 March southward turning in the IMF\nat the subsolar magnetopause have been studied as a\nfunction of local time. The response times exhibit both\ndiurnal and latitudinal dependencies with the minimum\nresponse times at 74 (\u008b4)\u00b0N centred near 1400 MLT.\nThe shortest response times, at 1400 MLT, were\nconsistent with prediction of the merging gap location\nresulting from IMF-By positive e\u0080ects. These response\ntimes translate into azimuthal signal propagation veloc-\nities of \u00183.9 (\u008b0.7) km s)1 at 55\u00b0N and 6.8 (\u008b4.1) km\ns)1 at 67\u00b0N (Fig. 9). The meridional response time\ntranslate into signal propagation velocities of 1.15\n(\u008b0.05) km s)1 at 1600 MLT and 7.0 (\u008b5.8) km s)1\nat 0700 MLT. It has been inferred that this velocity\nrepresents the expansion of the equatorward boundary\nof the return ionospheric flow.\nThe initial development of Dst (and hence the ring\ncurrent) following the SSC was accompanied by a rapid\nsuccession of particle injection events associated with\nsubstorm activity. The response time of Dst to the\nsouthward turning of the IMF at the subsolar magne-\ntopause (associated with the SSC at 2243 UT, March 20)\nwas 20 (\u008b6) min. Dst responded to the southward\nturning at 1314 (\u008b4) UT 21 March after 26 (\u008b15) min,\nconsistent with the response time associated with the\nSSC. The response time associated with the SSC was\nsimilar to the longest high-latitude ionospheric response\ntimes measured for that event and is coincident with the\nfirst particle injection event identified by the LANL\nspacecraft. The response time of Dst to the southward\nturning at 1314 (\u008b5) UT March 21 is again consistent\nwith the maximum high-latitude (67\u00b0N) ionospheric\nresponse times but precedes the nightside latitude 55\u00b0N\nresponse time and the earliest observed substorm\nexpansion phase onset. It is suggested that another\nmechanism in addition to substorm associated particle\ninjection events, such as the acceleration of the previ-\nously existing trapped particle population at L \u0015 4 via\ninward displacement due to an enhanced convection\nelectric field, may also play a role in decreasing the low\nlatitude magnetic field and possibly enhancing the ring\ncurrent. Thus following the southward turnings studied,\nDst\/Dst* initially responded to nightside processes\nduring interval 1, whereas Dst\/Dst* initially responded\nto dayside processess during interval 2.\nAcknowledgements. We would like to thank the world-wide pro-\nviders of ground magnetometer data, both for the stations shown\nexplicitly in this study, and for stations that provided estimates of\nthe AMIE-derived convection patterns, AL index, and Dst index.\nThe AMIE convection patterns also owe thanks to DMSP satellite\nmeasurements of elctron precipitation and ion drift, as well as\nmeasurements from digisondes, HF radars, and incoherent scatter\nradars. Some of these data were taken from the CEDARData base,\nwhich is supported by the National Science Foundation. TheGreen-\nland magnetometer data were provided by E. Friis-Christensen,\nDanish Meteorological Institute. The CANOPUS instrument array\nwas constructed and is maintained and operated by the Canadian\nSpace Agency for the Canadian scientific community. We would\nalso like to thank Dr. E.P. Karin of WDC-B2 in Moscow for\ninvaluable analogue Russian magnetometer plots. We thank the\nIMP-8 magnetometer team at the Laboratory for Extraterrestrial\nPhysics\/GSFC for providing the IMF data, the MIT Solar Wind\nGroup for providing the solar wind plasma data and G.D.
