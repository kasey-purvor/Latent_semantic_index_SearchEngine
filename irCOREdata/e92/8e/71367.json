Introduction\nThis paper is a further contribution to the extensive study by a number of authors of\nthe subalgebra lattice of a Lie algebra. A subalgebra U of a Lie algebra L is called upper\nmodular in L if, whenever B is a subalgebra of L which covers U \u2229 B (that is, such\nthat U \u2229 B is a maximal subalgebra of B), then \u3008U,B\u3009 covers U . (Here, \u3008U,B\u3009 denotes\nthe subalgebra of L generated by U and B.) This concept was introduced in [10] and\nstudied further in [2]. Our objective here is to gain deeper insight into the structure of\nLie algebras L containing an upper-modular subalgebra with certain extra properties,\nand to the position of such a subalgebra within L.\nIn \u00a7 2 we assemble some results relating upper-modular subalgebras to ideals in the\nalgebra. We also give a straightforward characterization of upper-modular subalgebras of\nsupersolvable Lie algebras. In \u00a7 3 we give some sufficient conditions and some necessary\nconditions for a subalgebra to be upper modular. For algebraically closed fields of any\n325\n326 K. Bowman, D. A. Towers and V. R. Varea\ncharacteristic, we determine the structure of Lie algebras having abelian upper-modular\nsubalgebras which are not ideals. Section 4 is concerned with studying the structure of\nsolvable Lie algebras L having an abelian upper-modular subalgebra U which is not an\nideal of L and such that U \u2229 L2 = 0. We determine this structure when the ground field\nis the real numbers; for more general fields, we need to impose the condition that L2 is\nabelian.\nIn \u00a7 5 we classify non-solvable Lie algebras over fields of characteristic zero having an\nupper-modular minimal subalgebra which is not an ideal. Such algebras exist if and only\nif\n\u221a\nF \u0005\u2286 F , where F is the underlying field. The final section is devoted to Lie algebras L\nin which every minimal subalgebra is upper modular in L. We obtain that, over a field of\ncharacteristic different from 2, 3, such an algebra is either quasi-abelian or a \u00b5-algebra.\nThroughout, L will denote a finite-dimensional Lie algebra over a field F . There will\nbe no assumptions on F other than those specified in individual results. The symbol \u2018\u2295\u2019\nwill denote a vector space direct sum. We will use the notation A \u2286 B to mean that A is\na subset of B, whereas A \u2282 B indicates that A is a proper subset of B. Standard results\nin Lie algebras are taken from [6].\n2. Preliminaries\nIf U is a subalgebra of L, then the normalizer of U in L is the set\nNL(U) = {x \u2208 L : [x, U ] \u2286 U}.\nFirst we give two results that have been proved elsewhere, but which will be used exten-\nsively later.\nLemma 2.1. Let U be upper modular in L. Then NL(U) = U or L.\nProof. This is Lemma 1.5 of [10]. \u0001\nTheorem 2.2. Let U be upper modular in L and let I be an ideal of L such that\nU \u2286 I \u0005= L. Then U is an ideal of L.\nProof. This is Lemma 2.2 of [9]. \u0001\nThe centre of L, Z(L), is defined by Z(L) = {x \u2208 L : [x, L] = 0}. If U is a subalgebra\nof L, the core of U , UL, is the largest ideal of L contained in U . We now have the following\ncorollary to the above result.\nCorollary 2.3. Let U be an upper-modular subalgebra of L which is not an ideal\nof L. Then Z(L) \u2286 UL.\nProof. Clearly, Z(L) \u2286 NL(U) = U . \u0001\nFor x \u2208 L, the Engel subalgebra of x, EL(x), is the Fitting null-component of L relative\nto adx. With a mild restriction on the field, we can improve the above result when U is\nan abelian upper-modular subalgebra of L.\nOn upper-modular subalgebras of a Lie algebra 327\nTheorem 2.4. Let L be a Lie algebra of dimension n over a field F which has at\nleast n elements and let U be an abelian upper-modular subalgebra of L which is not an\nideal of L. Then UL = Z(L).\nProof. We have that U is nilpotent and self-normalizing, and so is a Cartan subalgebra\nof L. It follows from Theorem 4.6 of [1] that U is minimal Engel in L, and so U = EL(x)\nfor some x \u2208 U . Write L = EL(x)\u2295 E\u00af(x), where E\u00af(x) is the Fitting one-component of L\nrelative to adx. Then L = U \u2295 E\u00af(x) and\n[L,UL] = [E\u00af(x), UL] \u2286 UL \u2229 [E\u00af(x), EL(x)] \u2286 UL \u2229 E\u00af(x) = 0.\nThus UL \u2286 Z(L). Now combine this with the Corollary 2.3. \u0001\nA subalgebra Q of L is called a quasi-ideal of L if [Q,V ] \u2286 Q+V for every subspace V\nof L. It is easy to see that quasi-ideals of L are always upper-modular subalgebras of L.\nWhen L is supersolvable, the upper-modular subalgebras of L are precisely the quasi-\nideals of L, as is shown next.\nTheorem 2.5. Let L be supersolvable and let U be upper modular in L. Then U is\na quasi-ideal of L.\nProof. Suppose that x \u2208 L \\ U . Then U \u2229 Fx = 0, which is covered by Fx. Hence\n\u3008U, x\u3009 covers U and so, since \u3008U, x\u3009 is supersolvable, \u3008U, x\u3009 = U + Fx. \u0001\n3. General results\nLemma 3.1. Let L be a Lie algebra and let U be a subalgebra of L. Let A be any\nsubspace of L such that L = U \u2295 A. Then U is upper modular in L if and only if U is\nmaximal in \u3008U, a\u3009, for every 0 \u0005= a \u2208 A.\nProof. The \u2018only if\u2019 part is trivial. To prove the converse, take a subalgebra S of L\nsuch that S\u2229U is maximal in S. Pick 0 \u0005= s \u2208 S, s \u0005\u2208 U . We have S = \u3008U \u2229S, s\u3009. We have\n\u3008U, s\u3009 \u2287 \u3008U \u2229 S, s\u3009 = S. This yields \u3008U, S\u3009 \u2287 \u3008U, s\u3009 \u2287 \u3008U, S\u3009, from which \u3008U, S\u3009 = \u3008U, s\u3009.\nNow decompose s = a + u, where a \u2208 A and u \u2208 U . As s \u0005\u2208 U , we see that a \u0005= 0. Also,\nwe have \u3008U, s\u3009 = \u3008U, a\u3009. By our hypothesis, U is maximal in \u3008U, a\u3009. Consequently, U is\nmaximal in \u3008U, S\u3009. Hence U is upper modular in L. \u0001\nNow, for algebraically closed fields of any characteristic, we are able to determine the\nstructure of Lie algebras having abelian upper-modular subalgebras which are not ideals.\nTheorem 3.2. Let F be an algebraically closed field of any characteristic. Let L be a\nLie algebra and let U be an abelian subalgebra of L which is not an ideal of L. Then U is\nupper modular in L if and only if L = A\u2295U , where either [A,U ] = 0, or A is an abelian\nideal of L and every element of U acts as a scalar on A.\n328 K. Bowman, D. A. Towers and V. R. Varea\nProof. Assume that U is upper modular in L. By Lemma 2.1, we have that U is a\nCartan subalgebra of L. Let L = L1(U) \u2295 U be the Fitting decomposition of L relative\nto U . Let 0 \u0005= a \u2208 L1(U). Then U is maximal in \u3008U, a\u3009 because of its upper modularity.\nAs L1(U) is a U -submodule of L, so is L1(U) \u2229 \u3008U, a\u3009. Since U is abelian, we have that\n{(adu)|L1(U)\u2229\u3008U,a\u3009 : u \u2208 U} is a set of simultaneously triangulable linear mappings. So\nthere must exist 0 \u0005= b \u2208 L1(U) \u2229 \u3008U, a\u3009 such that [u, b] = \u03b1(u)b for every u \u2208 U , where\n\u03b1(u) \u2208 F . Then we have that U + Fb is a subalgebra of \u3008U, a\u3009 strictly containing U .\nTherefore, U +Fb = \u3008U, a\u3009. This yields L1(U)\u2229\u3008U, a\u3009 = Fb, and hence Fa = Fb. Conse-\nquently, every non-zero element of L1(U) is a common eigenvector of adu for each u \u2208 U .\nFrom this it follows that adu acts as a scalar on L1(U), so that (adu)|L1(U) = \u03b1(u)1,\nwhere \u03b1(u) \u2208 F . Then, by using the Jacobi identity, we see that [L1(U), L1(U)] = 0 if\n\u03b1 \u0005= 0. This yields that either U acts trivially on L1(U), or L1(U) is an abelian ideal\nof L.\nTo prove the converse, let 0 \u0005= a \u2208 A. By our hypothesis, we have [u, a] = \u03b1(u)a, where\n\u03b1(u) \u2208 F , for every u \u2208 U . So U + Fa is a subalgebra of L. Therefore, \u3008U, a\u3009 = U + Fa\nand U is maximal in \u3008U, a\u3009. By Lemma 3.1, it follows that U is upper modular in L. \u0001\nNote that the condition that F is algebraically closed in Theorem 3.2 can be removed\nwhenever the subalgebra U is splitting.\nNext, we give sufficient conditions to guarantee that a subalgebra is upper modular.\nLemma 3.3. Let L = U \u2295 A be a Lie algebra, where U is a subalgebra of L and A is\na U -submodule of L.\n(i) Let B be any irreducible U -submodule of A. Then \u3008U,B\u3009 = \u3008U, b\u3009 for every 0 \u0005=\nb \u2208 B.\n(ii) If \u3008U, a\u3009 \u2229 A is irreducible as a U -submodule, for every 0 \u0005= a \u2208 A, then U is upper\nmodular in L.\nProof. (i) We have\n[U, \u3008U, b\u3009 \u2229 A] \u2286 [U,A] \u2229 [\u3008U, b\u3009, \u3008U, b\u3009] \u2286 A \u2229 \u3008U, b\u3009,\nso that \u3008U, b\u3009 \u2229 A is a U -submodule of A. Since 0 \u0005= b \u2208 B \u2229 \u3008U, b\u3009 and B is irreducible,\nwe have B = B \u2229 \u3008U, b\u3009. This yields \u3008U,B\u3009 \u2286 \u3008U, b\u3009 \u2286 \u3008U,B\u3009, whence \u3008U, b\u3009 = \u3008U,B\u3009, as\nrequired.\n(ii) By Lemma 3.1, we need only prove that U is maximal in \u3008U, a\u3009 for every 0 \u0005= a \u2208 A.\nTo see this, let M be a subalgebra of \u3008U, a\u3009 such that U \u2286 M \u2286 \u3008U, a\u3009. We have\nM = (M \u2229 A) \u2295 U . On the other hand, we see that M \u2229 A is a U -submodule of A and\nM \u2229A \u2286 \u3008U, a\u3009 \u2229A. So either M \u2229A = 0, and then M = U , or M \u2229A = \u3008U, a\u3009 \u2229A, and\nthen M = \u3008U, a\u3009. \u0001\nTheorem 3.4. Let L = U \u2295 A be a Lie algebra over any field F , where U is a\nsubalgebra of L and A is a U -submodule of L. Assume, in addition, that the following\nhold.\nOn upper-modular subalgebras of a Lie algebra 329\n(i) Each element of A lies in an irreducible U -submodule of L.\n(ii) B + U is a subalgebra of L, for every irreducible U -submodule B of A.\nThen U is upper modular in L.\nProof. Let 0 \u0005= a \u2208 A. By (i), there exists a U -submodule B of A containing a. By\nLemma 3.3 (i), we have \u3008U, a\u3009 = \u3008U,B\u3009. Since U + B is a subalgebra, we have \u3008U,B\u3009 =\nU + B, whence \u3008U, a\u3009 \u2229 A = (U + B) \u2229 A = B. It follows from Lemma 3.3 (ii) that U is\nupper modular in L. \u0001\nCondition (i) of Theorem 3.4 is clearly satisfied whenever U = Fu and the minimum\npolynomial of (adu)|A is irreducible. Also, it is satisfied in the case where the ground\nfield is infinite and perfect, U is abelian and the minimum polynomial of (adu)|A is\nirreducible for every u \u2208 U , as is shown by the following.\nProposition 3.5. Let L = U\u2295A be a Lie algebra over an infinite perfect field, where U\nis an abelian subalgebra of L, A is a U -submodule of L and the minimum polynomial of\n(adu)|A is irreducible for every u \u2208 U . Then each element a \u2208 A lies in an irreducible\nU -submodule of A.\nProof. Let \u2126 be the algebraic closure of F , and put A\u2126 = A \u2297F \u2126. Let\n\u03c3 : U \u2192 gl(A) : u \r\u2192 (a \r\u2192 [a, u])\nbe the representation corresponding to the U -module A. Pick u \u2208 U and decompose A\ninto its generalized eigenspaces relative to \u03c3(u). Since [\u03c3(u), \u03c3(v)] = 0 for every v \u2208 U ,\neach generalized eigenspace is a submodule of A. Also, since the minimum polynomial\nof \u03c3(u) is irreducible for every u \u2208 U , the transformations form a set of commuting\nsemisimple operators. It follows that A\u2126 can be decomposed into\n(A\u2126)\u03b1i = {a \u2208 A\u2126 : \u03c3\u02dc(a) = \u03b1i(u)a \u2200u \u2208 U},\nwhere \u03c3\u02dc is the representation of A\u2126 induced by \u03c3 and 1 \u0002 i \u0002 r.\nIf r = 1, then A =\n\u2211n\ni=1 Fai, where [u, a]i = \u03b1uai for all u \u2208 U , and the result is clear.\nSo suppose that r > 1. Then, as in Lemma 3.2 of [5], there exists u0 \u2208 U such that\n\u03b1i(u0) \u0005= \u03b1j(u0) for every 1 \u0002 i \u0005= j \u0002 r. Pick 0 \u0005= a \u2208 A, and put C =\n\u2211\u221e\nk=0 a(adu0)\nk,\nso that C is a cyclic subspace of A relative to \u03c3(u0). Now (A\u2126)\u03b1i is just the eigenspace\nof A\u2126 corresponding to the eigenvalue \u03b1i(u0) relative to \u03c3\u02dc(u0) for every 1 \u0002 i \u0002 r. Thus\nC\u2126 =\nr\u2295\ni=1\nC\u2126 \u2229 (A\u2126)\u03b1i .\nLet c \u2208 C and write c = c1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + cr, where ci \u2208 C\u2126 \u2229 (A\u2126)\u03b1i . Then, for every u \u2208 U ,\n\u03c3(u)(c) =\nr\u2211\ni=1\n\u03c3\u02dc(u)(ci) =\nr\u2211\ni=1\n\u03b1i(u)(ci) \u2208 C\u2126 \u2229 A = C,\nso C is a U -submodule of A. It is irreducible as such, as \u03c3(u0) has an irreducible minimum\npolynomial, and contains a. \u0001\n330 K. Bowman, D. A. Towers and V. R. Varea\nNow we give necessary conditions for a subalgebra to be upper modular.\nTheorem 3.6. Let L = U \u2295 A be a Lie algebra, where U is a subalgebra of L and\nA = N \u2295 V for some non-zero solvable ideal N of L and an irreducible U -submodule V\nof L (possibly zero). Let 0 \u0005= B be an irreducible U -submodule of A. Assume that U is\nupper modular in L. Then the following hold.\n(i) \u3008U, a\u3009 \u2229 A is irreducible as a U -submodule, for every 0 \u0005= a \u2208 A.\n(ii) If B \u2286 N , then B is an abelian subalgebra of L.\n(iii) \u3008U, b\u3009 = \u3008U,B\u3009 = U + B for every 0 \u0005= b \u2208 B.\n(iv) A is completely reducible as a U -module.\n(v) If U is abelian, then the minimum polynomial of (adu)|A is irreducible, for every\nu \u2208 U .\nProof. (i) First, take 0 \u0005= n \u2208 N . Since N is an ideal of L, the subspace N + U\nis a subalgebra of L. So \u3008U, n\u3009 \u2286 N + U . This gives \u3008U, n\u3009 \u2229 N = \u3008U, n\u3009 \u2229 A. Also,\nwe have that \u3008U, n\u3009 \u2229 N is an ideal of \u3008U, n\u3009. On the other hand, since Fn \u2229 U = 0,\nwe have that U is maximal in \u3008U, n\u3009 because of its upper modularity. It follows that\n\u3008U, n\u3009 \u2229 N is a minimal ideal of \u3008U, n\u3009. As N is solvable, we find that \u3008U, n\u3009 \u2229 N is a\nsolvable minimal ideal of \u3008U, n\u3009 and so is abelian. This yields that \u3008U, n\u3009\u2229A is irreducible\nas a U -module. Now, take a \u2208 A, a \u0005\u2208 N . Write Aa = \u3008U, a\u3009 \u2229 A. Suppose Aa \u2229 N \u0005= 0.\nThen there exists 0 \u0005= n \u2208 Aa \u2229 N . We have \u3008U, n\u3009 \u2286 \u3008U, a\u3009. Since U is maximal in\n\u3008U, a\u3009, it follows that \u3008U, a\u3009 = \u3008U, n\u3009. Then, by the above, we have that \u3008U, n\u3009 \u2229 A is\nirreducible and \u3008U, n\u3009 \u2229 A = \u3008U, n\u3009 \u2229 N . But then we have a \u2208 Aa \u2286 N , which is a\ncontradiction. Therefore, Aa \u2229 N = 0. Since Aa is a U -submodule of A, we have that\n0 \u0005= Aa \u223c= (Aa + N)\/N is a U -submodule of A\/N \u223c= V . Irreducibility of V implies that\nAa \u223c= V is irreducible as a U -submodule, as required.\n(ii) Assume that B \u2286 N . Pick 0 \u0005= b \u2208 B. By Lemma 3.3 (i), we have \u3008U,B\u3009 = \u3008U, b\u3009.\nSo B \u2286 \u3008U, b\u3009 \u2229 A. Moreover, in the proof of (i), we have obtained that \u3008U, b\u3009 \u2229 A is an\nabelian subalgebra of L.\n(iii) If B \u2286 N , then B + U is a subalgebra of L because B is abelian (by (ii) above).\nAssume then that B \u0005\u2286 N . Then we have N \u2229B = 0 by the irreducibility of B. Thus A =\nN \u2295B, since A\/N is irreducible. Now pick 0 \u0005= b \u2208 B. By Lemma 3.3 (i), \u3008U,B\u3009 = \u3008U, b\u3009.\nBy (i), \u3008U, b\u3009 \u2229 A is irreducible as a U -module. This gives B = \u3008U,B\u3009 \u2229 A. On the other\nhand, since L = U \u2295 A, we have \u3008U,B\u3009 = U + \u3008U,B\u3009 \u2229 A. Therefore, \u3008U,B\u3009 = U + B.\n(iv) Since A =\n\u2211\na(A \u2229 \u3008U, a\u3009), it follows from (i) that A is completely reducible as a\nU -module.\n(v) Assume that U is abelian. Then we know that the minimum polynomial of (adu)|B\nis irreducible, for every irreducible U -module B and for every u \u2208 U . By (i), we have\nthat every non-zero element of A is contained in an irreducible U -submodule of A. From\nthis follows (v). \u0001\nOn upper-modular subalgebras of a Lie algebra 331\n4. Solvable Lie algebras\nFirst we consider the case where the ground field is the real field. In this case, we are able\nto determine the structure of solvable Lie algebras L having an abelian upper-modular\nsubalgebra U which is not an ideal of L and such that U \u2229 L2 = 0.\nThe abelian socle of L, Asoc(L), is the sum of the minimal abelian ideals of L. The\nFrattini subalgebra of L, F (L), is the intersection of all the maximal subalgebras of L,\nand the Frattini ideal of L, \u03c6(L), is the largest ideal of L contained in F (L). If \u03c6(L) = 0,\nwe say that L is \u03c6-free.\nTheorem 4.1. Let F be the real field. Let L be a solvable Lie algebra and let U be\nan abelian subalgebra which is not an ideal of L and such that U \u2229 L2 = 0. Then the\nfollowing are equivalent.\n(i) U is upper modular in L.\n(ii) L2 \u2286 Asoc(L), L = L2 \u2295U and the minimum polynomial of (adu)|L2 is irreducible\nfor every u \u2208 U .\n(iii) L is \u03c6-free, L2 is abelian, U is a Cartan subalgebra of L and the minimum poly-\nnomial of (adu)|L2 is irreducible for every u \u2208 U .\nProof. (i) \u21d2 (ii). By Lemma 2.1, we have that U is a Cartan subalgebra of L. So\nL = L2 \u2295 U and L2 is just the Fitting one-component of L relative to U . By Theo-\nrem 3.6 (v), we have that the minimum polynomial, mu(x), of (adu)|L2 is irreducible for\nevery u \u2208 U . It is well known that there exists u0 \u2208 U acting non-singularly on L2. If\nmu0(x) = (x \u2212 t) for some t \u2208 F , then we see that L2 is precisely the eigenspace of L\ncorresponding to the eigenvalue t relative to adu0. So, by using the Jacobi identity, we\nobtain [L2, L2] = 0. Now suppose deg(mu0(x)) = 2. Let \u2126 be the complex field. Decom-\npose mu0(x) = (x \u2212 \u03b1)(x \u2212 \u03b2), where \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 \u2126. Let L\u2126 = L \u2297F \u2126, and decompose\n(L2)\u2126 = V\u03b1 \u2295 V\u03b2 into its eigenspaces relative to adu0. We have [V\u03b1, V\u03b2 ] \u2286 V\u03b1+\u03b2 = 0,\nsince u acts non-singularly on L2. Since, clearly, the other products are zero, we have\n[L2, L2] = 0. We conclude that L2 is abelian. Then we see that the irreducible U -\nsubmodules of L2 are precisely the minimal ideals of L contained in L2. Since, by Theo-\nrem 3.6 (iv), L2 is completely reducible as a U -submodule, it follows that L2 \u0002 Asoc(L).\n(ii) \u21d2 (i). Since L2 \u2286 Asoc(L), it follows that L2 is completely reducible as a U -\nsubmodule of L and that the irreducible U -submodules of L2 are precisely the minimal\nideals of L contained in L2. Since L2 is abelian and L = L2 \u2295 U , it follows from Propo-\nsition 3.5 and Theorem 3.4 that U is upper modular.\n(ii) \u21d4 (iii). See Proposition 1 of [7]. \u0001\nClearly, subalgebras U of dimension one which are not ideals satisfy the conditions\nin Theorem 4.1. In this case, we are able to give the multiplication table of such Lie\nalgebras.\nCorollary 4.2. Let F be the real field. Then a solvable Lie algebra L has a non-ideal\nminimal subalgebra of L which is upper modular if and only if one of the following holds.\n332 K. Bowman, D. A. Towers and V. R. Varea\n(i) L has a basis a1, . . . , ar, u with product given by [u, ai] = ai for every i and the\nother products are zero.\n(ii) L has a basis a1, . . . , ar, b1, . . . , br, u with product given by [u, ai] = bi, [u, bi] =\n\u03b2ai +\u03b1bi for every i, where \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 F and the polynomial x2 \u2212\u03b1x\u2212\u03b2 is irreducible\nover F .\nFor any infinite perfect field, we need to impose the condition that L2 is abelian.\nTheorem 4.3. Let F be any infinite perfect field. Let L be a metabelian Lie algebra.\nLet U be an abelian subalgebra which is not an ideal of L and such that L2 \u2229 U = 0.\nThen the following are equivalent.\n(i) U is upper modular.\n(ii) L2 \u0002 Asoc(L), L = L2 \u2295U and the minimum polynomial of (adu)|L2 is irreducible\nfor every u \u2208 U .\n(iii) L is \u03c6-free, U is a Cartan subalgebra of L and the minimum polynomial of (adu)|L2\nis irreducible for every u \u2208 U .\nProof. (i) \u21d2 (ii). Since U + L2 is an ideal of L properly containing U , Theorem 2.2\nimplies that L = L2\u2295U . From Theorem 3.6 (iv), it follows that L2 is completely reducible\nas a U -submodule of L. On the other hand, since L2 is abelian, we see that the irreducible\nU -submodules of L2 are precisely the minimal ideals of L contained in L2. This yields\nL2 \u2286 Asoc(L). Moreover, by Theorem 3.6 (v), it follows that the minimum polynomial\nof (adu)|L2 is irreducible for every u \u2208 U . The proof of the remaining parts are as in\nTheorem 4.1. \u0001\nFor arbitrary fields, we have the following result.\nTheorem 4.4. Let L be a solvable Lie algebra over any field F , and let U be an\nabelian subalgebra of L which is not an ideal of L and such that U \u2229 L2 = 0. Let U\nbe upper modular. Then, L = L2 \u2295 U , L2 is completely reducible as a U -submodule of\nL, every irreducible U -submodule of L2 is an abelian subalgebra of L and the minimum\npolynomial of (adu)|L2 is irreducible for every u \u2208 U .\nProof. This follows from Theorem 3.6. \u0001\nFor minimal subalgebras, the converse of Theorem 4.4 holds.\nProposition 4.5. Let L be a solvable Lie algebra over any field F and let u \u2208 L.\nThen Fu is upper modular in L if and only if either of the following hold.\n(i) Fu is an ideal of L.\n(ii) L = L2 \u2295 Fu, every subspace of L2 that is invariant and irreducible under adu is\nan abelian subalgebra of L and the minimum polynomial of (adu)|L2 is irreducible.\nOn upper-modular subalgebras of a Lie algebra 333\nProof. Suppose that (i) or (ii) holds; ideals are clearly upper modular, so suppose (ii)\nholds. Then (adu)|L2 is semisimple, so L2 is completely reducible as an Fu-module. Also,\nfrom the hypothesis that the minimum polynomial of (adu)|L2 is irreducible, it follows\nthat each element in L2 lies in an irreducible Fu-submodule of L2. The fact that Fu\nis upper modular in L is now immediate from Theorem 3.4. The converse follows from\nTheorem 4.4. \u0001\n5. Non-solvable Lie algebras\nFor any field of characteristic zero, we are able to classify the non-solvable Lie algebras\nhaving an upper-modular minimal subalgebra which is not an ideal. There exist such Lie\nalgebras if and only if\n\u221a\nF \u0005\u2286 F .\nIf u \u2208 L, we shall write CL(u) for {x \u2208 L : [x, u] = 0}.\nTheorem 5.1. Let L be a non-solvable Lie algebra over a field F of characteristic\nzero and let u \u2208 L. Then Fu is an upper-modular subalgebra of L if and only if one of\nthe following holds.\n(i) Fu is an ideal of L.\n(ii) The solvable radical R(L) of L is abelian, u lies in a Levi subalgebra S of L which\nis three-dimensional simple with basis u, v, w such that [u, v] = w, [v, w] = 4\u03b1u,\n[w, u] = 4\u03b2v, where \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 F and \u221a\u2212\u03b2 \u0005\u2208 F , L = R(L) \u2295 S and the minimum\npolynomial of (adu)|R(L)+Fv+Fw is (x2 + 4\u03b2).\nProof. Let Fu be an upper-modular subalgebra of L which is not an ideal of L. By\nLevi\u2019s theorem, we can write L = R \u2295 S, where R is a maximal ideal of L containing\nthe radical of L and S is a simple subalgebra of L. Suppose that u \u0005\u2208 S. Then u = r + s,\nwhere 0 \u0005= r \u2208 R, s \u2208 S. Now there is an element t \u2208 S such that \u3008s, t\u3009 = S (see, for\ninstance, Theorem 5 of [8]). Put T = \u3008u, t\u3009. Then\nR + T = R + \u3008u, t\u3009 = R + \u3008s, t\u3009 = L,\nso T\/(T \u2229 R) \u223c= L\/R \u223c= S is simple.\nSuppose that u \u2208 T \u2229R. Since T \u2229R is an ideal of T , it follows from Theorem 2.2 that\nFu is an ideal of T . But then NL(Fu) \u0005= Fu, and so Fu is an ideal of L, by Lemma 2.1,\ncontrary to our assumption. Hence u \u0005\u2208 T \u2229 R.\nSuppose now that T \u2229R \u0005= 0. Then T = (T \u2229R)\u2295Fu, since Fu is a maximal subalgebra\nof T . But this implies that T\/(T \u2229 R) is one dimensional, contradicting the fact that it\nis simple. This yields T \u2229 R = 0 and u \u2208 T \u223c= S, which is simple. Replacing S by T if\nnecessary, we may assume that u \u2208 S.\nBut Fu is upper modular in S, and hence a maximal subalgebra of S, as above. It\nfollows that S is three-dimensional non-split simple. Moreover, if \u03a3 is a Levi factor of L\ncontaining S, then Fu is a maximal subalgebra of \u03a3, and so \u03a3 = S and R = R(L) is\nthe radical of L. Therefore, L = R(L) \u2295 S. Also, the element u can be complemented\nby elements v, w to form a basis for S with products given by [u, v] = w, [v, w] = 4\u03b1u,\n334 K. Bowman, D. A. Towers and V. R. Varea\n[w, u] = 4\u03b2v, where \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 F and \u221a\u2212\u03b2 \u0005\u2208 F . Write V = Fv + Fw. We see that V is an\nirreducible Fu-submodule of L and that the minimum polynomial of (adu)|V is x2 +4\u03b2.\nWrite M = R(L) \u2295 V . If R(L) = 0, then case (ii) holds; so suppose that R(L) \u0005= 0.\nBy Theorem 3.6, it follows that R(L) is completely reducible as an Fu-module and the\nminimum polynomial of (adu)|M is irreducible. This gives that the minimum polynomial\nof (adu)|R(L) is also x2 + 4\u03b2. Moreover, we see that the adjoint action of u on R(L) is\nnon-singular.\nLet \u2126 be an algebraic closure of F and let R(L)\u2126 = R(L) \u2297F \u2126. We can decom-\npose x2 + 4\u03b2 = (x \u2212 \u03c9)(x + \u03c9), where \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126. This implies that we can decom-\npose R(L)\u2126 = (R(L)\u2126)\u03c9 \u2295 (R(L)\u2126)\u2212\u03c9 into its root spaces relative to adu. We find\n[(R(L)\u2126)\u03c9, (R(L)\u2126)\u2212\u03c9] \u2286 (R(L)\u2126)0 = 0, and the other products are also equal to zero.\nThis yields that R(L) is abelian. So, we have case (ii).\nIt remains to show that, in case (ii), Fu must be upper modular in L. We write V =\nFv + Fw. In this case, (adu)|R(L)+Fv+Fw is semisimple, and so R(L) + V is completely\nreducible as an Fu-module. Also, we have that, for every non-zero element in R(L) + V ,\nthe cyclic Fu-module generated by it is irreducible as an Fu-module. On the other hand,\nwe see V + Fu = S, and so V + Fu is a subalgebra of L. Now let B be any irreducible\nFu-submodule of L contained in R(L) \u2295 V . If B \u2286 R(L), then we have that B + Fu is\na subalgebra of L, since R(L) is abelian. Now assume B \u0005\u2286 R(L). Then B \u2229 R(L) = 0\nand R(L)\u2295B is a Fu-submodule of R(L)\u2295V . Since the latter is a completely reducible\nFu-submodule, there exists a complement C such that R(L) \u2295 B \u2295 C = R(L) \u2295 V .\nConsequently, dimB \u0002 2. If dimB = 1, then B is abelian and B + Fu is a subalgebra\nof L. Hence only the case dimB = 2 remains to be considered. Let \u2126 be an algebraic\nclosure of F and let B\u2126 = B \u2297F \u2126. Decompose, as above, x2 + 4\u03b2 = (x \u2212 \u03c9)(x + \u03c9),\nwhere \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126. Let B\u2126 = (B\u2126)\u03c9 \u2295 (B\u2126)\u2212\u03c9 be the decomposition of B\u2126 into its root spaces\nrelative to adu. Now we have that [u, [(B\u2126)\u03c9, (B\u2126)\u2212\u03c9]] = 0. This yields [B,B] \u2286 CL(u).\nOn the other hand, as x2 + 4\u03b2 is the minimum polynomial of (adu)|R(L)+B , we see that\nCL(u) \u2229 (R(L) + B) = 0. This yields CL(u) = Fu, and therefore [B,B] \u2286 Fu. It follows\nthat B + Fu is a subalgebra of L. Then, by Theorem 3.4, it follows that Fu is upper\nmodular in L. Now the proof is complete. \u0001\nCorollary 5.2. Let F be any field of characteristic zero. Let L be a non-solvable\nLie algebra. Then L has an upper-modular minimal subalgebra which is not an ideal if\nand only if L has a basis a1, . . . , ar, b1, . . . , br, u, v, w with product given by [u, ai] = bi,\n[u, bi] = \u22124\u03b2ai, [u, v] = w, [v, w] = 4\u03b1u, [w, u] = 4\u03b2v and the other products zero, where\n\u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 F and \u221a\u2212\u03b2 \u0005\u2208 F .\nCorollary 5.3. Over fields F of characteristic zero such that\n\u221a\nF \u2286 F , a Lie algebra L\nhaving an upper-modular minimal subalgebra which is not an ideal of L must be solvable.\n6. um(0)-algebras\nWe shall call L a um(0)-algebra if all of its one-dimensional subalgebras are upper mod-\nular in L. The Lie algebra L is almost abelian if L = L2 \u2295 Fx, where L2 is abelian\nOn upper-modular subalgebras of a Lie algebra 335\nand [x, y] = y for all y \u2208 L2; if L is abelian or almost abelian, we say that it is quasi-\nabelian. In [2], it was shown that, over a field of characteristic zero, L is a um(0)-algebra\nif and only if it is quasi-abelian or three-dimensional non-split simple. Here we want to\ngeneralize this result by considering a wider class of fields.\nA \u00b5-algebra is a non-solvable Lie algebra in which every non-zero proper subalgebra\nis one dimensional. Every \u00b5-algebra L is supersimple; that is, every subalgebra of L of\ndimension greater than one is simple. Over a perfect field of characteristic different from\ntwo and three, the only supersimple Lie algebras are the three-dimensional non-split\nsimple Lie algebras (see Proposition 1 of [4]). The generalization we obtain is that, over\na field of characteristic different from two and three, L is a um(0)-algebra if and only if\nit is quasi-abelian or a \u00b5-algebra. First we need the following result, which is related to\nLemma 4.1 of [3].\nTheorem 6.1. Let L be a Lie algebra over any field F and suppose that every two-\ngenerated subalgebra of L is either quasi-abelian or a \u00b5-algebra. Then either of the\nfollowing hold.\n(i) L is quasi-abelian.\n(ii) Every two-generated subalgebra of L is a \u00b5-algebra.\nProof. Suppose first that every two-generated subalgebra of L is quasi-abelian. Then\nevery two-dimensional subspace of L is a subalgebra of L, from which it is clear that\nevery subspace of L is a subalgebra of L. It follows that L is quasi-abelian.\nSo suppose that L has two-generated subalgebras Q, U , where Q is quasi-abelian and U\nis a \u00b5-algebra. We claim that we may assume that Q = \u3008x, y\u3009 and U = \u3008y, z\u3009 for some\nx, y, z \u2208 L. Clearly, either Q \u2229 U = 0 or Q \u2229 U = Fa for some 0 \u0005= a \u2208 L. Suppose first\nthat Q \u2229 U = 0. Choose any 0 \u0005= q \u2208 Q, 0 \u0005= u \u2208 U . Then \u3008q, u\u3009 is either quasi-abelian\nor a \u00b5-algebra. If it is quasi-abelian, take x = q, y = u and z \u2208 U \\ \u3008q, u\u3009; if it is a\n\u00b5-algebra, take x \u2208 Q \\ \u3008q, u\u3009, y = q and z = u. Now suppose that Q \u2229 U = Fa. Then\ntake x \u2208 Q \\ Fa, y = a and z \u2208 U \\ Fa. This establishes our claim.\nSuppose next that Q \u2229 U = Fy is an ideal of Q, so that [x, y] = \u03b1y for some \u03b1 \u2208 F .\nThen [y, z] \u0005\u2208 Fy, whence Fy \u2282 \u3008y, [y, z]\u3009 \u2286 \u3008y, z\u3009, giving \u3008y, [y, z]\u3009 = \u3008y, z\u3009. However,\n[x + z, y] = \u03b1y + [z, y], so \u3008y, z\u3009 = \u3008y, [y, z]\u3009 \u2286 \u3008x + z, y\u3009. But now \u3008x + z, y\u3009 is a two-\ngenerated subalgebra of L containing both Q and U , which is impossible.\nIt follows that Q \u2229 U = Fy is not an ideal of Q. There is an element q \u2208 Q for which\nFq is an ideal of Q, and, without loss of generality, we may assume that q = x. Thus\n[x, y] = \u03b2x for some \u03b2 \u2208 F . Then [x + z, y] = \u03b2x + [z, y] \u2208 \u3008x + z, y\u3009, so\n\u2212\u03b2z \u2212 [y, z] = \u2212\u03b2z + [z, y] = \u2212\u03b2(z + x) + \u03b2x + [z, y] \u2208 \u3008x + z, y\u3009.\nHence \u03b2z+[y, z] \u2208 \u3008x+z, y\u3009. Also, \u03b2z+[y, z] \u0005\u2208 Fy, since \u3008y, z\u3009 is a \u00b5-algebra, from which\nit follows that \u3008y, z\u3009 = \u3008\u03b2z+[y, z], y\u3009 \u2286 \u3008x+z, y\u3009. This means that \u3008x+z, y\u3009 is a \u00b5-algebra,\nbecause otherwise U = \u3008y, z\u3009 would be solvable. It follows that \u3008y, z\u3009 = \u3008x + z, y\u3009 and\nx \u2208 \u3008x, y\u3009 \u2229 \u3008y, z\u3009 = Fy, which is a contradiction. The result now follows. \u0001\n336 K. Bowman, D. A. Towers and V. R. Varea\nLemma 6.2. Let L be a Lie algebra over any field F . Then the following are equivalent.\n(i) L is supersimple.\n(ii) Every subalgebra of L is either one dimensional or simple.\n(iii) L has no two-dimensional subalgebras.\nProof. The equivalence of (ii) and (iii) is given by Varea in [11]. Since two-dimensional\nsubalgebras are never simple, (i) implies (iii). Finally, it is trivial that (ii) implies (i). \u0001\nWe shall need the following property of supersimple Lie algebras which was given by\nVarea in [12].\nTheorem 6.3. Let L be a supersimple Lie algebra over a field F of characteristic p\ndifferent from 2, 3. Then, for each 0 \u0005= x \u2208 L, there is a y \u2208 L such that \u3008x, y\u3009 = L.\nProof. This is Theorem 4 of [12]. \u0001\nThe above result has the following consequence for um(0)-algebras.\nLemma 6.4. Let L be a supersimple um(0)-algebra over a field of characteristic\ndifferent from 2, 3. Then L is a \u00b5-algebra.\nProof. Choose any 0 \u0005= x \u2208 L. Then, by the above theorem, there is a y \u2208 L such that\n\u3008x, y\u3009 = L. Now Fx\u2229Fy = 0, which is a maximal subalgebra of Fy, so Fx is a maximal\nsubalgebra of L. It follows that every one-dimensional subalgebra of L is maximal in L,\nand hence that L is a \u00b5-algebra. \u0001\nWe can now prove our main result.\nTheorem 6.5. Let L be any Lie algebra over a field F of characteristic different\nfrom 2, 3. Then the following are equivalent.\n(i) L is a um(0)-algebra.\n(ii) L is quasi-abelian or a \u00b5-algebra.\nProof. Suppose first that L is a um(0)-algebra, and let U = \u3008x, y\u3009 be a two-generated\nsubalgebra of L which is not quasi-abelian. Then U has dimension greater than two, and\nFx, Fy are maximal subalgebras of U . Suppose that U has a two-dimensional subalgebra,\nS = Fa + Fb, say. Clearly, we can assume that x \u0005\u2208 S, so that \u3008x, s\u3009 = U for every\n0 \u0005= s \u2208 S. But now Fx \u2229 Fa = 0, which is a maximal subalgebra of Fx, so Fa is\nmaximal in \u3008x, a\u3009 = U . This contradicts the fact that Fa \u2282 S \u2282 U . It follows that U has\nno two-dimensional subalgebras, and so is supersimple, by Lemma 6.2. But now U must\nbe a \u00b5-algebra, by Lemma 6.4. We have shown that every two-generated subalgebra of L\nis either quasi-abelian or a \u00b5-algebra. We conclude from Theorem 6.1 that either L is\nquasi-abelian or else every two-generated subalgebra of L is a \u00b5-algebra. In the latter\ncase, L is supersimple, by Lemma 6.2, and hence a \u00b5-algebra, by Lemma 6.4.\nThe converse is easy to check. \u0001\nOn upper-modular subalgebras of a Lie algebra 337\nAcknowledgements.
