Beyond\nthe optical properties induced by UV laser [1], its nonlinear\noptical properties induced by visible and near-infrared lasers\nhave drawn much attention in past years. For example, second-\n(SHG) or third-harmonic generation [2]\u2013[9], multiphoton\nabsorption (MPA) [10]\u2013[12], and MPA-induced luminescence\n[13]\u2013[15]. Of particular interest are the nonlinear properties at\nthe half bandgap spectral range [3], [6], [8], [9], [12], [14], [15].\nThese are all significant not only for understanding the basic\nphysical properties but also for the development of applications\nin nonlinear optoelectronics.\nUnder excitation with femtosecond lasers at 800 nm\n(1.55 eV), slightly below the half bandgap of ZnO (Eg\neV), the papers [3], [6], [8], and [9] reported only the\nSHG process in different ZnO materials; however, other work\n([12] and [14]) discussed only the two-photon absorption (2PA)\nprocess in ZnO films. In other words, by applying similar\nexcitation lasers ( ) to similar materials, completely different\nresults are observed. Clearly it seems that the two bodies of\nwork are contradictory.\nManuscript received January 3, 2006; revised April 9, 2006.

MPA-induced luminescence spectra of ZnO. (Color version available\nonline at http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org.)\nIn this letter, we discuss our observations on the confusion\nover SHG and MPA processes at the three-photon absorption\nband of ZnO ( nm nm). Two distinct pro-\ncesses are distinguishable using excitation power dependence\nmeasurements, and with femtosecond interferometric pulse au-\ntocorrelation experiments. The SHG is a two-photon process:\nit always has a quadratic relationship with excitation power;\nyet the MPA is a three- or four-photon process: it follows the\ncubic or higher order power law. The excitation power density\nis a main regulatory factor for this confusion. And, the inter-\nferometric pulse autocorrelation of four-photon absorption is\ndemonstrated for the first time.\nThe sample used in our experiments is a wurtzite structure\nZnO single crystal with a thickness of 1 mm. The femtosecond\nlaser source is a self-mode-locked Ti : sapphire oscillator\n(Tsunami), delivering 80-fs pulses at 82 MHz and is tunable\nbetween 700 and 1000 nm; the pulse spectrum is near Gaussian\nshape, and its bandwidth is 20 nm. The excitation laser\nis focused onto the sample at near normal incidence with a\n20-cm focal mirror. Backward luminescence from the sample\nis recoded with a spectrometer and a photomultiplier tube. The\npower of excitation laser is controlled with a neutral density\nfilter. The interferometric pulse autocorrelation experiments\nare carried out with a Michaelson-type interferometer [16].\nOther details of the experiments are presented in [15]. All of\nexperiments are performed at room temperature.\nFig. 1 shows the representative femtosecond laser MPA-in-\nduced luminescence spectra of ZnO excited at different wave-\nlengths.

The data for 395 nm\nare reproduced from [15], the solid lines are fitting results. (Color version avail-\nable online at http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org.)\nible band centered at 492 nm (2.52 eV) are luminescent emis-\nsions of ZnO; their relative intensities and the related photo-\nphysical processes under such multiphoton excitation have been\ndiscussed in [15]. The luminescence of ZnO becomes weak as\nnm, and can hardly be detected by our system as\nnm because the threshold for multiphoton excitation\nis close to the maximum output power of our laser.\nThe SHG emission peaks of the excitation laser aremarked by\narrows in Fig. 1. They always overlap with certain spectral com-\nponents of luminescent spectrum of ZnO, and are often identi-\nfied as shoulders as 880 nm nm because the band-\nwidth of visible luminescence ( 100 nm) is much broader than\nthat of the SHG emission ( 15 nm). The SHG emission peaks\nare easy to resolve as nm as the MPA-induced lumi-\nnescence in ZnO becomes weak. The SHG emission is difficult\nto observe as nm because it falls into the strong linear\nabsorption band of cross bandgap transition of ZnO. The mech-\nanism of the SHG process in different ZnO materials has been\ndiscussed extensively [2]\u2013[9].\nTo further elucidate the apparent confusion between MPA-\ninduced luminescence and SHG emission in ZnO, excitation\npower dependence of three emission bands for each has been\nmeasured, the representative results are depicted in Fig. 2 on\nlogarithmic scale. Fig. 2(a) shows the excitation power-depen-\ndent luminescence spectra for nm. The peak posi-\ntion of the UV band shifts gradually from 400 nm at lower ex-\ncitation power to 395 nm at higher power. Actually, this UV\nband is a result of superposition of MPA-induced UV lumines-\ncence (395 nm) and SHG emission (400 nm); two peaks are\nhard to resolve by deconvolution in a single luminescent spec-\ntrum as both the wavelength and bandwidth of the peaks are\nso close. The SHG is a strict two-photon process and always\nhas a quadratic relationship with excitation power, yet the MPA\nis a resonant three-photon process at nm and fol-\nlows a cubic power law; hence, the intensity of the component\nat 395 nm grows much faster than that at 400 nm as the ex-\ncitation power is increased. As a result, the UV component at\n395 nm dominates the spectra at higher excitation power. When\nthe excitation power is lower than the threshold for MPA, the\nMPA-induced luminescence is very weak, SHG emission dom-\ninates the UV band, and the peak position is 400 nm.\nFig. 2(b) and (c) plot the intensities of the three deconvolved\nemission bands as a function of excitation laser power for\nnm and nm, respectively. The slopes obtained\nfrom fitting are 2.0, 4.2, and 3.4 for SHG emission, MPA-\ninduced UV, and visible luminescence, respectively. The data\nfrom other give similar results. These immediately prove\nthat SHG is a two-photon process, and MPA is a three- or four-\nphoton process. The deviation of the slope for the three-photon\nprocess from 3.0 to 4.2 is attributed to the involvement of the\ndeep centers as intermediate states in the multiphoton transition,\nwhich makes the MPA transition responsible for UV lumines-\ncence a four-photon process [15].\nGenerally, the power density threshold for a three-photon\nprocess is higher than that for a two-photon process by at\nleast one order of magnitude for certain , hence, the SHG\nemission in ZnO can be generated efficiently at lower excitation\npower as nm nm, MPA requires higher\nexcitation power. These are obvious in Fig. 2. Under normal\nlaboratory conditions with nanosecond lasers, the power den-\nsity is only sufficient for studying the SHG process in ZnO\n[2], [4], [5]; however, the use of femtosecond lasers allows for\nhigher excitation power density ( 1GW\/cm ); for example in\n[12] and [14] 2PA in ZnO is clearly detected through the use of\ntightly focused femtosecond laser even with a microscope ob-\njective. When excitation power density is properly controlled,\nfemtosecond lasers can also be used to generate SHG emission\nin ZnO [3], [6], [8], [9], yet care must be taken to avoid the\nconfusion from MPA-induced luminescence.\nThe interferometric pulse autocorrelation technique is\nfrequently used for quantitative characterization of the mul-\ntiphoton process and ultrashort laser pulse [16]. The signal\nbackground ratio of the autocorrelation trace is an indicator\nof the order of certain MPA processes: the ratios for two-,\nthree- and four-photon processes are 8 : 1, 32 : 1, and 128 : 1,\nrespectively [15]\u2013[17]. To further investigate the confusion\nbetween SHG- and MPA-induced luminescence in ZnO, the\ninterferometric autocorrelation experiments are carried out for\neach while the SHG emission, UV, and visible luminescence\nare being monitored. The representative results are plotted in\nFig. 3. The signal background ratios obtained from UV traces\nrange from 45 : 1 ( nm) to 128 : 1 ( nm),\nthose from visible traces are from 25 : 1 ( nm) to 45 : 1\n( nm). These ratios indicate the MPA responsible\nfor UV luminescence is mainly a four-photon process, and the\nMPA responsible for visible luminescence is a three-photon\nprocess. The ratios from the SHG emission are always close to\nDAI et al.: OBSERVATION OF BOTH SECOND-HARMONIC AND MPA-INDUCED LUMINESCENCE IN ZnO 1535\nFig. 3. Interferometric pulse autocorrelation traces for \u0000 \u0000 \u0002\u0003\u0004 nm and\n\u0000 \u0000 \u0005\u0003\u0004 nm. The backgrounds are normalized to 1 for all traces. (Color\nversion available online at http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org.)\n8 : 1, but slightly larger ( 13 : 1, see Fig. 3); this is because the\nSHG signal recorded in detection contains a small contribution\nfrom the MPA-induced luminescence. The results of these\nexperiments are consistent with the excitation power depen-\ndences in Fig. 2. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an\ninterferometric autocorrelation trace with a ratio of 128 : 1.\nBy the fundamentals of nonlinear optics, the SHG efficiency\nis determined by microscopic symmetry of material structure\nand the incident angle of laser beam [3]\u2013[5]; additionally, the\nvisible luminescent band of ZnO is tightly related to the level\nof defect states [15]. To achieve full understanding of the con-\nfusion, further experiments on ZnO crystals and films with dif-\nferent defects level are necessary. The perfect ZnO crystal does\nnot contain defect states, hence, it has no visible luminescence,\nso the confusion does not exist as nm. However, it\nis still a challenge at present to make such a high-quality ZnO\nmaterial because the bandgap is too broad to avoid the inclusion\nof any defects.\nIn summary, we have studied the relationship between SHG-\nand MPA-induced luminescence in ZnO with a femtosecond\nlaser between 800 and 1000 nm. The excitation power density\nis a main regulatory factor for this confusion; it can be used to\nselectively control SHG or MPA process in ZnO. The interfer-\nometric autocorrelation for four-photon absorption is demon-\nstrated for the first time. This letter is instructive in the develop-\nment of nonlinear optical applications of ZnO.\nREFERENCES\n[1] B. Guo, Z. R. Qiu, and K. S.
