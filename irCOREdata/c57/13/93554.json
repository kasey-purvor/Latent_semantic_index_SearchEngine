We estimate the \u2018regulatory tax\u2019 for 14 British and 8 continental \nEuropean office locations. The values for Britain are orders of magnitude greater than any \nelsewhere. Exploiting panel data, we provide strong support for our hypothesis that the \nregulatory tax varies according to local prosperity and its responsiveness to this depends on \nwhether an area is controlled by business interests or residents. Our results also imply that \nthe cost to office occupiers of the 1990 conversion of commercial property taxes from a local \nto a national basis \u2013 transparently removing any fiscal incentive to local communities to \npermit development \u2013 exceeded any plausible rise in property taxes.  \n \n \nJEL classification: H3, J6, Q15, R52. \nKeywords: Land use regulation, regulatory costs, business taxation, office markets.\nOffice space supply restrictions in Britain: the political economy of market revenge \n \n 1 \n1 Introduction: The Problem in an International Perspective1 \n \nThe cost of constructing a m\n2\n of office space in Birmingham, England, in 2004 was \napproximately half that in Manhattan.2 This is not very surprising since Birmingham is a \nstruggling, medium sized city on the flat plains of the British Midlands and Manhattan is big, \ntopographically constrained, prosperous and highly dynamic. If we were looking for an \nAmerican equivalent to Birmingham, maybe, St Louis, Missouri would pop up. When we \ncouple the cost of construction with the costs of occupation of that same m\n2\n, however, we do \nget a shock. In the same year, the total occupation costs per m\n2\n were 44% higher in \nBirmingham than they were in Manhattan (KingSturge, 2004).  Something very odd must be \ngoing on. The obvious anomaly is the intensity and restrictiveness of land use controls in the \nUK and this paper sets out to investigate the economic costs of these restrictions and what \ndrives them. \n \nIn the past few years US urban economists have become interested in the analysis of land use \nregulation and concerned about increasing regulatory restrictions influencing the supply and \ncosts of housing3 and perhaps sorting between cities4. Glaeser et al (2005) for example \nconclude that regulatory restrictions increase housing prices in the most tightly constrained \nmetro areas by some 50% and by considerably more in Manhattan. This is potentially of \nconcern because not only is the effective \u2017tax\u2018 substantial but it has been rising over time. \nHowever, no researcher has yet reported a significant effect of regulatory constraint on the \ncosts of commercial space in the US. This is no great surprise given the fiscal incentives to \nlocal communities to allow commercial development. \n \nThe situation in the UK, however, is several orders of magnitude more restricted. This is \npartly because land use regulation in the UK takes the form of universal growth constraints: \nand growth constraints applied not just to the total area of urban land take for each city but \nindividually to each category of land use within each city. So urban \u2017envelopes\u2018 are fixed by \ngrowth boundaries but within these envelopes the areas of land available for retail, offices, \nwarehouses and industry are all tightly controlled. Although not entirely inflexible, \nGreenbelts surrounding cities have been more or less sacrosanct since they were established, \nout of town retail is effectively prohibited5, and local planning authorities have been \nextremely reluctant to expand the area zoned for commercial space. There are, moreover, a \nraft of preservation designations and height controls on buildings. The present pattern of \nregulation was essentially set in aspic in 1947 so has been in place for two generations. \n \n                                                 \n1\n We thank John Clapp, Robin Goodchild, Colin Lizieri, John Muellbauer, John Quigley, Tsur Somerville and \nSotiris Tsolacos for helpful comments and suggestions. We are grateful to Robin Goodchild, courtesy of Jones \nLang LaSalle, Peter Damesick from UK CB Richard Ellis and Simon Rawlinson from Davis Langdon for kindly \nproviding essential data. Thanks also to an anonymous referee and the editor of this journal for helpful \ncomments. Gerard Dericks provided excellent research assistance. The remaining errors are the sole \nresponsibility of the authors. \n2\n This uses the ratio of Birmingham office construction costs to those in London from Davis Langdon (see \nSection 3 of this paper), the ratio of Davis Langdon\u2018s London construction cost estimates to those from Gardiner \nand Theobald to apply to Gardiner and Theobald\u2018s construction cost data for New York offices to estimate \nfigures on a comparable basis for both Birmingham and New York. \n3\n See, for example, Brueckner (2000); Evenson and Wheaton (2003); Glaeser and Gyourko (2003); Glaeser et al \n(2005); Mayer and Somerville (2000); Mayo and Sheppard (2001); Phillips and Goodstein (2000); or Song and \nKnaap (2003). \n4\n See Gyouko et al (2005). \n5\n On two different grounds: to maintain the economic strength of city centres and to reduce car use. Whether \neither objective is actually served by this policy and, in so far as it is, at what cost \u2013 is unclear. \nOffice space supply restrictions in Britain: the political economy of market revenge \n \n 2 \nAny reluctance of local communities to allow expansion of commercial space may be at least \nsignificantly explained by the fact that they have strong tax incentives not to. Taxes on \ncommercial real estate (the business rate) accrue to national not local government (and \naccount for some 5% of national tax revenues) but local authorities have to provide services \nto commercial property. The only interesting (and for us, useful) exception is the City of \nLondon which, when the \u2017Uniform Business Rate\u2018 (UBR) was introduced, was granted a \nunique exception and allowed to retain up to 15% of revenues raised. In addition to the \nproperty tax implications, there are other costs to local voters associated with development. \nTogether, these generate very strong NIMBY pressures. As the retiring political head of the \nplanning authority for one of the office locations analysed in this paper said when asked what \nhad been his major achievement in office:  \n[our main achievement was that] \u2015\u2026not a single new major office development has been \napproved. We managed to keep development down.\u2016 (Reading Chronicle, 1989).  \nAs we argue below, with the important and helpful exceptions of the City of London and \nLondon Docklands, the only incentive for local communities to permit commercial real estate \ndevelopment is local voters\u2018 fears of unemployment. \nA further factor is that constraints and growth controls in the UK have been being applied \nsince 1947. The nearest equivalent form of regulation in the USA, in Portland Oregon, still \nmuch less restrictive than applies in the UK, has been in force only since 1973. Because \nregulatory constraints primarily affect new construction they only influence real estate prices \nprogressively over time. As was noted in Cheshire and Sheppard (2005) their impact on \nhousing prices only began to be observable from about ten years after they were introduced, \nthat is from 1955 or so. \nThe result is that the economic effects of land use regulation are orders of magnitude greater \nin the UK than they are in the US. Using data for 1984 and with quite conservative \nassumptions, Cheshire and Sheppard (2002) estimated that the net welfare costs6 of \nrestrictions on land supply in a prosperous community in southern England, Reading, were \nequivalent to nearly 4% as an annual income tax. In 2003, at the outer boundary of permitted \ndevelopment in Reading, housing land was some \u00a33,000,000 per hectare (Cheshire and \nSheppard, 2005). A few feet away agricultural land, not within the urban envelope, was worth \nperhaps \u00a37,500 per hectare. As Muellbauer (2005) commented, such price distortions are \n\u2017grotesque\u2018. The constraints on the housing market have become so significant that the British \nTreasury and the Department of Communities and Local Government (formerly the Office of \nthe Deputy Prime Minister) have now commissioned two separate enquiries (Barker, 2003; \n2004 and 2006a and b). \nOffice space in London (KingSturge, 2003 to 2005; CBRE, 2004 and 2005) is not just more \nexpensive than anywhere else in the world; it is some three times as expensive as the next \nmost expensive city in Europe, Paris, and more than three times as expensive as in Manhattan. \nEven more telling, perhaps, are the costs of office space in British provincial cities. \nBirmingham was the next most expensive European city after Paris, and Glasgow, Edinburgh \nand Manchester were all more expensive than Manhattan; office space cost twice as much in \nany of those smaller and not very prosperous British cities as it did in San Francisco \u2013 a city \nwhich not only is highly prosperous and has some of the tightest regulatory constraints on \n                                                 \n6\n Net in the strict sense that benefits were also quantified and so the measure was the excess value of total costs \nover benefits expressed in terms of equivalent income variation. \nOffice space supply restrictions in Britain: the political economy of market revenge \n \n 3 \nhousing in the US but also has topographical constraints on land supply. Office space in \nBirmingham cost 124% more than in fast growing, twice as big and land strapped Singapore. \nTo date there has been rigorous quantification of the economic effects of land use constraints \non the UK housing sector but not for any category of commercial property. The purpose of \nthis paper is to address this gap in our knowledge and investigate the costs of land use \nregulation for commercial property in the UK in a rather more rigorous way than is possible \nwhen just comparing the rent and occupation costs.  \nAn obvious problem in analysing the economic impacts of land use planning is identifying \nexactly what element in total occupation costs \u2013 the cost of space to economic agents - may \nreasonably be attributed to \u2017planning\u2018 restrictions. This is because i) such restrictions take \nmany forms over and beyond restricting the supply of land or space; and ii) it is difficult to \noffset for the normal factors such as city size etc, that urban economic theory tells one should \nbe expected to influence the price of land and space.  Furthermore, if we want to estimate the \neconomic impact of any measured increase in space costs resulting from regulation, we would \nneed to go a second step \u2013 not included in this research. We should estimate the impact on \noutput, employment and incomes generated by the increase in space costs produced by \nregulatory constraints. Then offset those costs against any benefits regulation produced. \n \nIn the context of the residential sector, a theoretically rigorous methodology was set out in \nCheshire and Sheppard (2002) for estimating both the gross and the net costs of regulatory \nrestrictions on the supply of residential land and so the net welfare cost these had. This, \nhowever, is demanding on data and research time and depends on being able to explicitly \nidentify and estimate the economic impacts of the goods\/amenities generated by planning, the \nimpact of regulation on supply and the indirect utility functions of residents\/citizens. Even if \nit were not so data intensive, it is not clear such a methodology could be adapted to estimating \nthe economic and welfare impacts of regulation of the supply of non-residential property \nbecause of the difficulty of estimating the relevant production function.  \n \nWe estimate here, just the first of these elements: a measure of the total cost of regulatory \nconstraints on the price of office space expressed as a \u2017tax\u2018 \u2013 that is as a percentage of \nconstruction costs. To do this we adapt the methodology first developed and applied to the \nManhattan condominium market by Glaeser et al (2005). The value of this measure and its \ninterpretation is the subject of section 2 of this paper. The Glaeser et al (2005) methodology \nhas the considerable attraction that it is intellectually coherent, resting on established \nmicroeconomic theory, and it is not too demanding with respect to data and estimation \ntechniques. Its downside is that it is a \u2017black box\u2018 number in that it does not differentiate \nbetween costs that are imposed by different aspects of regulation and may miss certain types \nof cost that regulation imposes. It is an aggregate measure of the gross cost of regulatory \nconstraints limiting the height and floor area of buildings and \u2013 more indirectly \u2013 the supply \nof land for the use in question. So it reflects the costs of restrictions on land supply, space by \nplot ratios or height restrictions, or common forms of conservation designation. It does not, \nhowever, capture costs imposed by compliance complexity or delays in decision making. In \naddition, it only gives a \u2017cost\u2018 not a net welfare or net impact on output measure. As is well \nknown, there are measurable benefits from some aspects of regulation and, since space is \nsubstitutable to a degree in both production and consumption, the effects on output or welfare \ncan only be estimated if both the benefits and the extent of substitutability are known. So the \nregulatory tax estimates are a lower bound estimate of a gross cost of land use regulation in \nany location. \nOffice space supply restrictions in Britain: the political economy of market revenge \n \n 4 \n \nGlaeser et al (2005) report their results for Manhattan apartments as a price to construction \ncost ratio (rather than as a quasi-tax rate; regulatory tax to marginal construction cost). For the \nmost recent year they had data for, 2002, this ratio was 2.07. In our tax-rate measure and \nsubject to the caveat that we are explicitly measuring from observed marginal construction \ncosts, this would translate to a value of 1.07. They also investigated other data which \nsuggested that the value of the regulatory tax on housing was higher in some West Coast \nurban areas, such as the Bay Area and Los Angeles, than it was in the New York urban area \nas a whole (it was much higher in Manhattan itself than it was in the New York metro area) \nalthough it was still substantial in the New York area. However, in 10 of the 21 urban areas \ninvestigated there was no measurable impact of regulation on house prices. Nor was there any \nindication of a significant \u2017regulatory tax\u2018 on office property in Manhattan. This provides \nsome standard against which to evaluate the results for office property in the British cities \nreported below. \n \n2 An Interpretation of the Regulatory Tax (RT) as a Measure of the  \nCosts of Restrictions \n \nThe key idea of the Regulatory Tax (RT) approach is simple; in a world with competition \namong property developers and free market entry and exit, price will equal (minimum) \naverage cost since this includes \u2017normal\u2018 profit. We would argue that competition between \ndevelopers and free entry are reasonable assumptions both because of the low costs of entry to \nsmall scale development, such as converting a single building to office use, and the \ninternational nature of the development industry. In Britain the best known example of \ninternational entry might be Olympia and York, the Canadian developers of Canary Wharf, \nbut most provincial office locations have examples of buildings developed by Japanese, \nGerman, Dutch or Swedish developers.  \n \nMarginal construction costs rise with building height, so in the absence of restrictions on \nheights, buildings should rise to a point where the marginal cost of adding an additional floor \nequals its market price. If building higher is less profitable per m\n2\n than building over a greater \narea, we still should expect the marginal cost of an extra floor to be equal to price: buildings \nwould just be lower on average but the overall urban land take would be greater. Bertaud and \nBrueckner (2005) demonstrate the formal equivalence of height restrictions compared to land \nsupply restrictions. Any gap between the observed market price and the marginal construction \ncost can be interpreted, therefore, as a \u2017regulatory tax\u2018 \u2013 the additional cost of space resulting \n\u2013 in aggregate \u2013 from the system of regulation in that particular market. If the sales price of an \nadditional floor of office space exceeded the marginal cost of building this additional floor \nthen developers would have an arbitrage opportunity. The difference between the price of \nfloor space and its cost of construction must be due to some form of regulation.  \n \nThis is illustrated in Figure 1 which depicts the cost curves of representative competitive \ndevelopers in (by assumption) two unregulated markets; one relatively prosperous and \n\u2017attractive\u2018 office market, say, London (L) and one less prosperous and \u2017attractive\u2018 market, \nsay, Birmingham (B). For illustrative convenience, we assume that the marginal construction \ncost curve (MCC) is identical in both markets implying that wages, materials and other \nvariable costs do not vary regionally. We also assume \u2013 quite reasonably \u2013 that buildings of a \ngiven type have an optimal floor plan to height ratio (given the price of land).  To make the \ndiagram easier to follow we intentionally exaggerate the extent to which marginal \nconstruction costs rise with building height. \nOffice space supply restrictions in Britain: the political economy of market revenge \n \n 5 \nFig. 1: A Developer\u2019s Cost Curves without Space Restrictions \n \n \nLAC  \n*\nLP  \n*\nBP  \nBAC  \nB LMCC MCC\uf03d  \nbuilding height \nprice per m\n2\n \n*\nBh  \n*\nLh  \n \nIn a competitive market P=MCC=AC and is given.

The average cost curves, AC, of course include the costs of the fixed factor, land. The \ndifferences between the price and the average variable costs at the optimal building height can \ntherefore be interpreted as land rents (subject to site preparation and infrastructure costs). The \nillustrated cost curves imply that building heights will be higher, and so MCC will also be \nhigher, in London. Underlying \u2017pure\u2018 land values are relevant in the sense that, given different \ninput costs, the optimal capital to land ratio will be different in different markets. The land \nrent is greater for London than for Birmingham so buildings are higher but the difference in \nland rents between the two markets does not affect the value of the RT. In the absence of \nOffice space supply restrictions in Britain: the political economy of market revenge \n \n 6 \nrestrictions, RT will be zero. This, indeed, is one of the attractions of the RT measure. Since \nland costs are an element in fixed costs, they never affect the measured RT. Since land costs \nare difficult to measure and it is considerably more difficult still to estimate any impact of \nland use regulation on the cost of land, the RT measure of the costs of regulation entirely \navoids a difficult problem. \n \nWe can think about this in more detail by considering two cases. Case F is the unregulated \nsituation while Case R is the regulated one.  \n \nCase F: Suppose we have an unregulated world with a competitive development and office \nmarket and the cost of an additional floor rises with building height: then building heights rise \nuntil, per m\n2\n Marginal Cost of Construction (MCC)=Marginal Revenue (MR)=Average Cost \n(AC)=Price (P)=Average Revenue (AR). In such a market, therefore, the price per m\n2\n \nincludes all costs for a given building: construction + land + normal profit. Suppose we then \nadd a hypothetical additional floor. The MCC per m\n2 \nis\n \nhigher for this additional floor than for \nthe existing highest floor but price is not. The \u2017land\u2018 is already paid for in the existing \nbuilding, part of fixed costs and included in AC. There is, then, no appreciable RT.  \n \nNow consider the regulated world of Case R in which there is a constraint on building \nheights. We have an existing building and a competitive development and office market, but it \nis no longer true that building height rises to the point at which MCC=MR. They could \nprofitably be higher but this profit is capitalised into the price paid for land so profits are still \n\u2017normal\u2018. Land is a fixed cost included, therefore, in average costs. So if we now add a \nhypothetical floor to an existing building, there is no extra land cost. The marginal cost is only \nthe extra construction cost but the price reflects the constrained supply, now without land \nrents having to be paid for, so price exceeds MCC and the difference represents the gross cost \nof regulation \u2013 or the RT. This is illustrated in Figure 3. \n \nFig. 3: A Developer\u2019s Cost Curves with Height Restrictions (London only) \n \n \n*\nLP  \n.restr\nLP  \nno\nLMCC  \nheight \nrestriction \nLAVC  \nLAC  \nLMCC  \nbuilding height \n \nprice per m\n2\n \nRT  \n*\nLh  \n.restr\nLh  \n \nThe fact that the price of the extra space in Case R is higher has nothing to do with paying for \nthe land but reflects the constraint, including scarcity of space. Although the RT measure \neliminates the impact of land costs in the current regulated market conditions if the market \nOffice space supply restrictions in Britain: the political economy of market revenge \n \n 7 \nwere unregulated, land costs per m\n2\n would be lower: so the observed MCC in a regulated \nmarket is likely to differ from that in an unregulated market. \n \nOther forms of planning imposed constraint are possible, however. Plot ratio constraints (in \nthe USA floor area ratios) which determine the maximum floor space relative to the size of \nthe site are common. Again consider first a world without constraints. In the absence of any \nregulations the developer would choose an optimal floor plan and corresponding optimal \nheight such that MCC=AC=P. Moreover, the developer could ignore negative externalities, \nsuch as restricted views the building causes to its neighbours, so would have an incentive to \nchoose the site just big enough to accommodate the floor plan subject to user preferences and \nimpacts of plot ratios on the productivity of the building.  \n \nFig. 4: A Developer\u2019s Cost Curves with Plot Ratio Constraints (London only) \n \n \n no plr\nLAC  \nLMCC  \nfloor space \n \nprice per m\n2\n \n.  incr site area\nRT  \nplr\nLAC  \n reduce height\nRT  \n*\nLs  \nplr\nLs  \n \nWith the plot ratio constraint, however, in order to build the identical property, the developer \nwould have to either (a) increase the size of the site, keeping the floor plan constant or (b) \nreduce the height of the building, again keeping the floor plan constant. Consider case (a) \nfirst. The additional land needed to reduce the plot ratio to reach the threshold level adds fixed \ncost, so increases AC, but has no effect on MCC. This effect is illustrated in Figure 4. The RT \nin this case is the difference between plrAC  and MCC  at the original optimal floor space  *s . \nAlternatively (case b), the developer could reduce the height of the building until the \ncorresponding floor space reduction (from *s  to plrs ) is sufficient to conform to the plot ratio \nconstraint. This case is equivalent to the height restriction constraint described above. In this \ncase the RT would be the difference between no plrAC  and MCC at the point plrs . The \nobserved RTs in the two cases will not typically be the same but they will both be strongly \npositively correlated with the degree to which the plot ratio is binding.7 Of course, the \n                                                 \n7\n In fact it can be easily demonstrated for the case of linear MCC curves and land as the only fixed cost that both \nRT measures increase with the rigidness of the plot ratio constraint. The RT associated with a height reduction is \nalways larger than the RT associated with a proportional increase in the site area. For example, if the optimal \nfloor space needs to be reduced in half to comply with the plot ratio constraint, then the RT associated with the \nsite increase is exactly 2\/3 of the proportional height reduction. The relative difference between the two RT \nmeasures decreases with increasing rigidness of the constraint. In the limit, with the rigidness of the plot ratio \nconstraint becoming extremely binding, the two RT measures become identical. \nOffice space supply restrictions in Britain: the political economy of market revenge \n \n 8 \ndeveloper has a third option, to reduce the floor plan itself, keeping the site area and building \nheight constant. In Figure 4 with floor space on the x-axis this is equivalent to the height-\nreduction case. \n \nIn reality, however, the two cases are not equivalent since at some point the cost per floor \nstarts to rise exponentially with the number of floors. To illustrate this argument, consider the \nfollowing case: To provide 36,000 m\n2\n of space (a large office building) with a floor plan of \n1,200 m\n2\n would imply a 30 storey building and so a height of, say, 100 metres: to get the \nsame space with a floor plan of only 25m\n2\n per floor would imply 1,440 stories \u2013 a building \nsome 4.75 kilometres high. Clearly, apart from issues of technical feasibility, at some extreme \nheight the cost of adding an additional storey will become astronomically high. \n \nNow consider another extreme of hypothetical regulation: suppose that there are no \nconstraints on building or land availability at all, but stringent compliance costs related to, \nsay, permits, but such costs are a function only of individual buildings so are a fixed cost. \nOnce the compliance process has been completed, the agreed building can be constructed with \nno further compliance costs at all. In such a case, the costs of compliance will appear as a \nfixed cost and, if the results related to the incidence of Impact Fees are applicable (Ihlanfeldt \nand Shaughnessy, 2004) will be fully (negatively) capitalised into land prices. Thus, there \ncould be no impact on marginal construction costs or on the price of space. There will be a \ndeadweight loss, but this loss will fall uniquely on the price of land although given that the \nprofitability of transferring land from agricultural to urban use will be reduced, it could \nreduce the overall supply of urban land and so have some affect on space costs. \n \nFor illustrative purposes, the analysis above has been in a partial equilibrium setting from the \nperspective of a single developer or building. However, in practice not all regulatory \nconstraints are as simple as this. In Britain there are simultaneous restrictions imposed on plot \nratios, building heights and on the total area of land on which, in any city, it is permitted to \nbuild offices as well as compliance costs. In these circumstances in any city in which there is \na strong demand for office space, there will be a binding constraint on total space availability \ndriving up both the price of space and the price of land with permission to develop. It will still \nbe clear, however, that AC (which includes the costs of land) will be above MCC so the RT \nmeasure will reflect the overall space constraint in the market. \n \nWhat these examples suggest is that the relationship between measured RT and the actual \ngross costs of regulation (if these could be measured exactly) is, in principle, a variable one \nand will depend on the precise form the regulatory constraints take. So long as at least an \nelement of the regulatory constraints takes the form of restrictions on the height of buildings \nand plot ratios, however, the measured RT will be strongly and positively correlated with the \nactual gross costs of regulatory constraints. The RT measure, however, will likely be a lower \nbound estimate of the gross costs because, for example, some of the regulatory constraints \nmay relate to compliance costs or costs of delay. \n \nNeed this concern us particularly in the case of British offices? Restrictions on building \nheights take several forms but are applied in all British markets. In the City of London, for \nexample, no less than eight separate \u2017view corridors\u2018 of St Paul\u2018s cathedral (both foreground \nand background) are protected from building above some 55 metres and five \u2017view corridors\u2018 \nof the Monument are similarly protected as are four street blocks around the Monument (City \nof London, 1991). There are, in addition, extensive \u2017Conservation Areas\u2018 within which very \nlimited changes to the external appearance of buildings is possible \u2013 obviously including \nOffice space supply restrictions in Britain: the political economy of market revenge \n \n 9 \nheight - and, throughout the City \u2013 as in all British cities \u2013 there are \u2017plot ratios\u2018 controlling \nthe total size of buildings relative to the size of the site. These were set at 5.1:1 in the City \n(City of London, 1991, para. 16.42). There are, in addition, other regulations affecting the \ndesign of buildings which limit height and space within them. Planning policies in London\u2018s \nWest End are substantially more restrictive than those in the City, since very large areas \u2013 \nmost of Mayfair and Belgravia \u2013 are designated Conservation Areas where it is not possible to \nbuild higher than the existing structure and changes to the external appearance of buildings \nare prohibited. If the building is individually listed \u2013 as a high proportion of buildings in \nLondon\u2018s West End are \u2013 then even internal alterations are prohibited. Such historic \nconservation regulations undoubtedly generate amenity values, not included in a measure of \nRT.  \n  \nIn summary, then, the RT measure of the gross costs of regulatory constraints on buildings is \nsomething of a black box in that it will incorporate the cost of restrictions on the supply of \nland for the use in question and restrictions on building heights. These may arise from various \nsources but are imposed in all British office locations by \u2017plot ratio\u2018 controls. Since land use \nplanning is a national system in Britain it seems likely that compliance costs and costs of \ndelay do not vary significantly across locations but such costs will not be fully captured in the \nRT measure and may not be captured at all. So we can conclude that estimated RT values will \nbe strongly and positively correlated with actual gross costs of regulatory constraints but in \nabsolute terms may be lower bound estimates. \n \n3  Data and methodology \n \nHere we discuss the data used to estimate regulatory tax values which as noted above, we \nexpress as a rate relative to marginal construction costs. The total unemployment rate and \nservice employment growth rate data used in the subsequent analysis are discussed in Section \n6. To estimate the RT we need \u2017price\u2018 and \u2017marginal construction cost\u2018 data. Our empirical \nanalysis builds on the best available data for the British office market and a number of \ncontinental European cities. After careful and detailed discussion to agree how best to \nmeasure marginal costs of construction (i.e., the estimated cost of adding an additional \nhypothetical floor to an existing building) Davis Langdon estimated time-series data for the \nagreed definitions by market (per square metre). Davis Langdon is the leading UK producer \nof construction cost data for the building industry and produces the Spon Handbooks used by \nquantity surveyors and architects (Davis Langdon, 2005). A detailed description of the \nmethodology Davis Langdon used to derive the marginal cost of construction is explained in \nCheshire and Hilber (2007). Gardiner and Theobald (2006) \u2013 Davis Langdon\u2018s major \ncompetitor \u2013 provide (average) construction cost data for our sample of continental European \ncities. Unfortunately, comparable time-series data on the market price of office space, in the \nsense of capital values, is not readily available; only data on rents, yields, vacancies and rent \nfree periods can be obtained. CB Richard Ellis (CBRE) the largest property consultancy in the \nUK, provided the relevant data for British markets. Similar data (although estimated on a \ndifferent basis) were also provided by Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL) for a number of our British \nlocations and all the continental European ones we report estimates for in Table 2. We used \nthe common British locations to make the best adjustment we could to a comparable basis.  \n \nOnly rental not capital values are available because office buildings are treated as income \nproducing assets that are typically leased floor by floor. We therefore need to impute the \nmarket price per m\n2\n of an additional floor of office space (the \u2017capitalised value\u2018) using the \navailable information on rents, yields, rent-free periods and vacancy rates. The estimation \nOffice space supply restrictions in Britain: the political economy of market revenge \n \n 10 \nprocedure is briefly described below and descriptive statistics of the relevant data are \nprovided in Appendix Table A1. Since we do not observe transaction prices but must rely on \nestimates, we carry out a quite extensive sensitivity analysis using the most \u2017conservative\u2018 and \n\u2017radical\u2018 assumptions which are defensible to estimate capital values. These provide a range \nof estimates for the RT (see Table 1) although most of the discussion is in terms of what we \nregard as a relatively conservative, \u2017central\u2018 estimate.  \n \nTABLE 1 \nSummary Statistics: Regulatory Tax relative to Marginal Construction Cost \n \nVariable: Ratio: Regulatory Tax \/ MCC Obs.

Most time-series go back to 1973 with two series (those for the City of London \nand London West End) reaching back to 1960. CBRE also provided us with total occupation \ncost data, although only for 2004 and 2005 and for 8 of the 14 relevant markets. We obtained \nthe matching marginal construction cost data for all 14 markets from Davis Langdon, based \non actual construction projects in those markets going back to 1961. Finally, we obtained \nregional vacancy rate information from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) and \nnational rental void (vacancies) data from Investment Property Databank (IPD).  \n \nThe data for the RT estimates for European office locations come from two additional \nsources. JLL provided us with prime rent and equivalent yield data from 1990 to 2005 \n(continental European cities) and for 1987 to 2005 (British cities). These allow us to compute \nhypothetical capital values (so called \u2017Peter Pan values\u2018) based on the assumption that the \nbuildings are permanently renewed. Unfortunately, JLL could not provide us with matching \ninformation on voids or vacancies, so we use the ratio of the CBRE to JLL estimated values \nwhere we have common locations (for six British locations) to obtain as comparable as \npossible a set of capital values for all locations, British and continental European. Gardiner \nand Theobald\u2018s (2006) \u2017International Construction Cost Survey\u2018 provides average (as \nOffice space supply restrictions in Britain: the political economy of market revenge \n \n 11 \nopposed to marginal) construction cost data back to 1999 so we can estimate RT values from \n1999 to 2005. We use the ratio of marginal to average construction costs from Davis Langdon \nand Gardiner and Theobald for the two markets (the City of London and London West End) \nfor which both sets of data are available to estimate the hypothetical marginal cost of \nconstruction for the continental European office locations.8  \n \nImputing Missing Values \nOur raw data come in different time-intervals. The prime rent data, for example, are quarterly \nfor the City of London and London\u2018s West End back to 1960; however, they are quarterly, \nmonthly, half-annually and annually for the other 12 markets, in all but three cases, back to \n1973. Similarly, the yield data come in various time intervals. The construction cost data are \nannual. Hence, in order to make our data comparable, we use annual numbers when available \nand compute annual numbers when not. \n \nEven though we use annualised data, we still have missing values for a number of variables \nand markets. For example, we only obtained rent-free period data for two markets (the City \nof London and London\u2018s West End) and only between 1993 and 2006. For the remaining \nyears and other markets we need to impute the rent-free periods using the available data (see \nCheshire and Hilber, 2007, for details). Similarly, we need to impute equivalent yields prior to \n1972 using the available data (again see Cheshire and Hilber, 2007, for details). The imputed \nvalues obviously introduce an additional degree of uncertainty into estimates prior to 1972. \nWe also have to impute vacancy rates from relatively short time-series of regional data from \nODPM and longer time-series data from IPD; details are again available in Cheshire and \nHilber (2007). Imputing values of yields could, we believe, have a significant impact on the \nfinal estimates of RT. So we should be very cautious with respect to any interpretation of \nestimated values of the RT prior to 1972. The absolute differences to estimates resulting from \nany plausible alternative values of rent free periods and vacancy rates are, however, \ncomparatively small. We are confident, therefore, that while the need to impute values for \nsuch data is not entirely satisfactory, the additional margin of error it may introduce into the \nestimates is small in relative terms. \n \nWe have to impute missing rental values using national rent-index data from Hillier Parker \n(today CBRE). The Hillier Parker ICHP national rent-index data is available back to 1965 but \nonly for three years. This does allow us to impute missing rental values between 1965 and \n1972 but for missing years, we assume a linear trend.  \n \nFinally, we impute total occupation cost by assuming a constant scaling factor to fully \nadjusted prime rents using the ratio: average of the total occupation cost for each market in \n2004 and 2005 divided by fully adjusted prime rent. We can match prime rent and total \noccupation costs for 8 of the 14 markets. For the remaining 6 markets we assume the ratio of \nthe geographically closest market for which data are available. \n                                                 \n8\n This approach is imperfect as it is unlikely, as an anonymous referee pointed out, that the relationship between \naverage construction cost (ACC) and marginal construction cost (MCC) is constant across markets and over \ntime. In fact, one can show that to the extent that continental European markets have lower ACC and MCC and \nare less strongly regulated (compared to the two London markets) we will overestimate the RT for the low cost \nand less rigid markets, suggesting that the true RT for the least regulated market (Brussels) might be even closer \nto zero than we estimate. Similarly, to the extent that the true RT in any continental European market is \ndecreasing (increasing) over time, our approach will tend to understate the change. Observations for the City of \nLondon for which we have the two alternative estimates of the RT appear to confirm the predicted bias; when we \nuse the actual MCC we estimate quite a steep decline in the RT between 1999 and 2005. When we have to rely \non adjusted ACC information we find a much less steep decline.  \nOffice space supply restrictions in Britain: the political economy of market revenge \n \n 12 \n \nOur goal is to estimate, as accurately as possible, the magnitude of the RT over time for the \n14 local office markets. The RT (expressed as a tax rate) can be formulated as: \n \n1\njt jt jt\njt\njt jt\nV MCC V\nRT =  =\nMCC MCC\n\uf02d\n\uf02d  (1) \n \nwhere Vjt is the market value of an additional square metre of office space in market j at time \nperiod t and where MCCjt is the corresponding marginal construction cost of adding one \nsquare metre of an additional floor. \n \nThe market value of a square metre of additional office space is estimated using the \n\u2017Equivalent Yield Model\u2018, which is probably the most commonly used model to value income \nproducing property in Britain (see Brown and Matysiak, 2000, for details). According to the \nequivalent yield model, the property value can be expressed as: \n \n\uf028 \uf0291\njt jt jt\njt\njt\njt jt\njt n\nI R I\nV\ny y y\n\uf02d\n\uf03d \uf02b\n\uf02b\n (2) \n \nwhere jtV  is the value of the property (in location j at time period t), jty  is the corresponding \nequivalent yield, jtR  is the so called \u2017current rental value\u2018, jtI  is the \u2017passing income\u2018 and jtn  \nis the number of years to the next rent review.  \n \nThe equivalent yield is equal to the internal rate of return (IRR) of two cash flow streams (a \nstream of \u2017passing incomes\u2018 up to the rent review and then a stream of current rental values, \nassumed to be constant, in real terms, in perpetuity). The \u2017passing income\u2018 (which is \nexpressed in nominal terms) only includes the rents that the tenants \u2017pass\u2018 on to their landlord. \nTenants that are still in their rent-free period or non-rented space do not contribute to the \npassing income. Hence, in order to get from the (headline) prime rent to the passing income, \nadjustments for rent-free periods and vacancies have to be made as follows: \n \n1 1\njt jt\njt jt\nRent Free Period Vacancy Rate in %\nI Prime Rent\nTypical Contract Length 100\n\uf0e6 \uf0f6 \uf0e6 \uf0f6\n\uf03d \uf0b4 \uf02d \uf0b4 \uf02d\uf0e7 \uf0f7 \uf0e7 \uf0f7\n\uf0e8 \uf0f8 \uf0e8 \uf0f8\n. (3) \n \nThe \u2017current rental value\u2018 is measured in real terms and is assumed to remain constant in \nperpetuity. The capitalised value of the current rental value reflects the reversion value at the \ntime when the current lease expires. \n \nIf we make the reasonable assumption that the current rental value (in real terms) equals the \npassing income, then the property value can be expressed as \n \njt\njt\njt\nI\nV\ny\n\uf03d . (4) \n \nUsing equation (3), the estimated value can finally be expressed as: \n \nOffice space supply restrictions in Britain: the political economy of market revenge \n \n 13 \nRent Free Period Vacancy Rate in %\nPrime Rent 1 1\nTypical Contract Length 100\njt jt\njt\njt\njt\nV\ny\n\uf0e6 \uf0f6 \uf0e6 \uf0f6\n\uf0b4 \uf02d \uf0b4 \uf02d\uf0e7 \uf0f7 \uf0e7 \uf0f7\n\uf0e8 \uf0f8 \uf0e8 \uf0f8\uf03d . (4.1) \n \nThe main advantage of using the equivalent yield model to estimate the capitalised value of \noffice space is that it requires estimates of only two unknown variables \u2013 passing income and \nthe equivalent yield. The equivalent yield can be estimated from comparable properties in the \nlocal market place that have recently been sold.  \n \nAlthough the equivalent yield model is simplistic and obviously has a number of serious \neconomic shortcomings, it provides surprisingly accurate valuations. This is probably for \nsome combination of two reasons: First, professional valuers (\u2017appraisers\u2018 in the US) are \nfamiliar with subtle changes in the market that will influence the choice of yield; and second, \nvaluers\u2018 valuations \u2013 based on the equivalent yield model \u2013 are the basis for transactions. \nHence, even if a valuation does not reflect the \u2017true value\u2018 of a property (reflecting all future \ncash flows discounted at the \u2017correct\u2018 rate), as long as buyers and sellers use the same \nvaluation model, they will end up agreeing on a (transaction) price that reflects the model\u2018s \npredicted value. \nFig. 5: Regulatory Tax (Central Estimate)\nLondon Office Markets\n0.00\n2.00\n4.00\n6.00\n8.00\n10.00\n12.00\n14.00\n16.00\n18.00\n1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005\nYear\nR\ne\ng\nu\nla\nto\nry\n T\na\nx\nCity of London London WE Docklands Hammersmith Croyden\n \n \nThe regulatory tax rates, RT, are reported for all 14 markets and for all time periods with \navailable data (see Figures 5 to 8). \n \n The above outlines the way in which we estimated the \u2017central\u2018 value of the RT.

Table 1 illustrates \nthe sensitivity of the results to alternative assumptions. It is clear from this that there are no \nrealistic assumptions which eliminate a substantial RT. The mean value, at 2.37, even for the \nmost conservative lower, lower bound estimate, is more than twice the highest value \nestimated for Manhattan housing by Glaeser et al (2005). \n \nTable 2 reports the RT (central estimate) for all 14 UK office markets with available data and \nfor 8 continental European locations as well as values for Manhattan offices from Glaeser et \nal (2005). The UK markets were selected to cover as wide and representative a range as \npossible including the main office locations in Scotland. We report values for 1999, 2005 and \nthe mean for years from 1999 to 2005. Our focus on those years is because they are the only \ncommon years for which we have RT estimates for all locations.  \n \nThe Appendix Table A3 shows the annual mean values. We should largely discount values \nbefore 1973 since these are i) weighted to the two London markets; and ii) they are less \nreliable for reasons given above. It is immediately clear that the value of the regulatory tax \nmoves with the real estate cycle. In principle \u2013 at least in the longer term \u2013 it should not be \ninfluenced by demand but real estate prices are substantially more volatile than are \nconstruction costs. This, of course, is one effect of regulatory restrictions which constrain \nsupply and so reduce its elasticity in the upswing and increase the volatility of the cycle. An \ninteresting point is that the standard deviation of completions relative to stock of office space \nin Brussels \u2013 our continental European location with the lowest estimated RT (see Table 2) \u2013 \nwas twice that of London over the period 1986 to 2001 (Jones Lang LaSalle, 2001). The high \npoint of 4.01 for the mean value for British locations, reached in the boom of 1973, has not \nbeen exceeded since although this is partly a weighting issue: in 1973 the London markets \nhad a greater weight in the mean. Nevertheless, the basic message is clear: the value of the \nestimated regulatory tax on office space averaged across all British office markets is an order \nof magnitude higher than the peak observed in the most highly regulated sector of the most \nOffice space supply restrictions in Britain: the political economy of market revenge \n \n 16 \nregulated market in the US and substantially more than in comparable continental European \nlocations.  \nTABLE 2 \nEstimates of Regulatory Tax for UK Office Markets and Selected European Cities \n \nCity Estimated Regulatory Tax Rate (RT) \nUK Markets\n\u2020\n 1999 2005 \nAverage  \n1999-2005 \nLondon West End 9.18 8.89 8.09 \nCity of London 6.41 3.34 4.88 \nCanary Wharf 3.43 2.77 3.27 \nLondon Hammersmith 2.77 1.82 2.19 \nManchester 2.71 2.50 2.30 \nNewcastle upon Tyne 1.06 1.19 0.97 \nCroydon 1.18 0.99 0.94 \nEdinburgh 3.11 2.62 2.91 \nGlasgow 2.33 2.05 2.04 \nMaidenhead 3.72 2.27 2.70 \nReading 2.71 1.61 2.03 \nBristol 1.53 1.96 1.57 \nBirmingham 2.59 2.68 2.50 \nLeeds 2.15 2.17 1.93 \nSelected European Cities\n\u2021\n 1999 2005 \nAverage  \n1999-2005 \nLondon West End 7.62 8.37 8.00 \nCity of London 4.68 4.31 4.49 \nFrankfurt 5.44 3.31 4.37 \nStockholm 4.28 3.30 3.79 \nMilan 2.07 4.11 3.09 \nParis: City 2.35 3.75 3.05 \nBarcelona 2.23 3.16 2.69 \nAmsterdam 2.12 1.92 2.02 \nParis: La D\u00e9fense 1.41 1.93 1.67 \nBrussels 0.52 0.84 0.68 \nUnited States (based on Glaeser et al, 2005) \n1996  \n(cycle bottom) \n2000  \n(cycle peak)  \nManhattan (New York City)  0 0.50  \n\u2020 \nEstimates of capital values are based on data provided by CBRE, IPD and DCLG. Estimates of the \nmarginal construction costs of space for each location were specially calculated for us by Davis \nLangdon. It is thought that these data together provide a more accurate estimate of underlying values of \nthe \u2017Regulatory Tax\u2018 than do the average adjusted data used for Continental European locations. The \nparallel estimates for the two London locations provide a comparison.\n \u2021 \nEstimates are based on capital \nvalue data provided by Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL) and construction cost data provided by Gardiner and \nTheobald. The data from JLL are hypothetical capital values based on mid-point yields and prime rent \ninformation. We adjusted these values to predict actual capital values. The Gardiner and Theobald \naverage construction cost estimates are adjusted by another scaling factor to estimate marginal \nconstruction costs. This scaling factor is derived by using marginal construction cost information from \nDavis Langdon. Details of the computation methods are available in Cheshire & Hilber (2007).\n \nOffice space supply restrictions in Britain: the political economy of market revenge \n \n 17 \n \nIt is more revealing, however, to look at the time series data for the individual markets \nreported in Figures 5 to 8 \u2013 continuing to focus on the central estimate. The most revealing \npoint of all is the contrast between the City and West End of London and the role of Canary \nWharf and the development of the Docklands. Until the early 1980s, the City office market \ndominated supply and the City was the dominant location, with a quasi-monopolistic control. \nIt had a highly restrictive planning policy both in terms of height restrictions (which still \nendure) and historic designation. Even as late as 1981, 22 conservation areas, affecting 28% \nof its land area were designated (Fainstein, 1994). The response to the expansion in demand \nfor office space from the 1960s was a rapid rise in prices reflecting the supply restrictions. \nThe estimated value of the RT reached a high point in 1973, only just below a value of 18 (a \n\u2017tax rate\u2018 of 1800%). This fell back to just more than 5 in the downturn of the mid-1970s.  \n \nAnother difference between the City and all other office locations except London\u2018s Docklands \n\u2013 a special case controlled by the London Docklands Development Corporation (see Section \n6) \u2013 is that of the political economy of the control on planning. In all locations other than the \nCity (and Docklands), voting, and so political control, rests with the resident adult population. \nAs has been cogently argued by Fischel (2001), depending on rates of owner occupation \nwhich are high in the UK, this produces a pressure to restrict development to protect house \nowners\u2018 asset values. This is likely to be re-enforced by the asymmetry of the incidence of \ncosts and benefits of physical development. The costs - both short term disruption and in \nterms of asset value losses - are very localised while benefits are thinly and widely spread. In \nthe City of London, however, political control of the planning system rests with the City \nCorporation which is controlled by the local business community and its interests.9 While \nthese include property owners and real estate investors, the business community is dominated \nby other groups who have a mutual interest in retaining the City as a successful and \ncompetitive location for their businesses.  \n \nAs is explained by Fainstein (1994), the threat of the deregulation of financial services, \nactually introduced in 1986, concentrated the City fathers\u2018 minds wonderfully.  \n \n\u2015\u2026.once the economic benefits of restricting growth ended, attitudes towards physical \nchange easily became more flexible\u2026.Financial firms that already possessed space \nadjacent to the Bank of England benefited from their monopoly position and had no \nmotivation to favour expansionary policies. Financial deregulation and competition \nchanged the stakes. Competitive office development in the nearby Docklands threatened \nthe interests of\u2026 the City \u2026.Once the decision to reverse the previous conservationist \nattitudes had been made, the City\u2018s officers embarked on an active promotional effort. \nThe planning director solicited advice from firms concerning their space needs and \nencouraged developers\u2026to accommodate them\u2026until the 1980s the City did not have a \nplanning officer but only an architect who concerned himself with design approvals\u2026new \ndevelopable land was designated\u2026and floor area ratios were modified to\u2026permit an \naverage of 25% expansion in the size of buildings.\u2016 Fainstein (1994, page 40) \n \nThe planning system in the City is likely, therefore, to be responsive to the interests of \ncommercial tenants and threats to local competitiveness. Such threats were visible by the \nearly 1980s. By the time of the property market recovery of the second half of the 1980s, and \ndespite the growth of the financial services sector, the City was already under threat from both \n                                                 \n9\n This goes back to the ancient privileges of the medieval city and the leverage its tax revenues gave it in \nnegotiating a high degree of independence and local control from the crown. \nOffice space supply restrictions in Britain: the political economy of market revenge \n \n 18 \nDocklands and other financial centres (including satellite centres such as Reading in which \nmore office space was constructed during the early 1980s than in the City itself) and its \nplanning policies were becoming notably more relaxed. Its Unitary Plan, lodged in 1991 (City \nof London, 1991), but drawn up in the second half of the 1980s, identified as its first policy  \n\u2015To encourage office development in order to maintain and expand the role of the City as a \nleading international financial and business centre\u2016 (para. 3.19). By the end of the 1980s, \nthere were already large scale modern developments in the City, built to the highest \ninternational standards. Broadgate, for example, opened in 1991, provided 360,000 m\n2\n of new \noffice space. \n \nMoreover, there was a radical change to the taxation of business property introduced in April \n1990. Before then business property taxes (the business rates) had been set by local \ngovernments (which were also the Planning Authorities) and - subject to standard procedures \nfor \u2017rate equalisation\u2018 across the country - the revenues had accrued to local communities. \nThere was concern in the then Conservative government that anti-business, left wing local \ncouncils were boosting revenues and attempting to run re-distributive local policies funded by \nsetting ever higher local business rates. This, it was thought, would hinder the long term \ncompetitiveness of British business. So in 1990 the Uniform Business Rate (UBR) was \nintroduced with national rate-setting and with revenues accruing to central government. There \nwas one exception, however; the City Corporation (self-evidently not anti-business!) was \nallowed to add its own \u2017precept\u2018 to collect its own revenues. Thus from 1990 there has been a \nstrong and entirely transparent negative fiscal incentive for any local government in Britain, \nexcept the City of London, to permit any commercial development. \n \nWhile the value of the RT in the City rose during the later 1980s as property values rose \nrapidly in the boom, it never reached the high of 1973. Indeed, in contrast to the rest of \nBritain, the RT estimate for the City has been on a downward trend since 1973. We can see \nfrom the evidence that is available for the Docklands that the regulatory regime was far less \nrestrictive there, with an estimate of the RT never exceeding 4 \u2013 though that still represents a \nquasi-tax rate of 400%. The West End, where there is political control by residents and a \nnegative fiscal incentive for development, is a market which specialises in sectors other than \nfinancial services. It has much stronger planning protection for conservation reasons, with \nheight restrictions which are impossible to breach (unlike in the City where, outside the \nconservation areas or protected sight lines, employing a \u2017trophy architect\u2018 has been an \nemerging mechanism for building higher). As a consequence, the West End has, in contrast to \nthe City, experienced a steady increase in estimated RT with its high value of 1973 exceeded \nin 2000 and with an estimated value of 8.1 for the period 1999 to 2005 \u2013 almost twice that in \nthe City. \n \nThe pattern outside the London locations is much as would be expected. The estimated RT \nwas much lower until quite recently and in Newcastle in the 1980s was negative for a short \ntime.10 In a representative, prosperous, satellite centre such as Reading, which was a major \n                                                 \n10\n Although our judgement is that it is safest to use the estimated RT values as an index of regulatory costs, the \nfact that in locations where we know planning systems are flexible \u2013 most obviously Manhattan, for offices, and \nBrussels \u2013 absolute values are estimated to be close to, or zero \u2013 suggests RT is at least not inconsistent with an \nabsolute measure. The fact that in a depressed local economy, as Newcastle was in the 1980s, values are \nestimated to be around zero also re-enforces this point. Note also that for the one market where we have precise \ninformation on land values (see Cheshire and Sheppard, 2005) and so can estimate average total costs directly \u2013 \nReading in 1984 \u2013 our calculated RT values are very close to those estimated using the methodology outlined in \nsection 3: 2.46 or 2.82 (depending on whether one measures for a 6 or 7 storey building) compared to 2.78 as \nestimated. \nOffice space supply restrictions in Britain: the political economy of market revenge \n \n 19 \nrecipient of the back office move from London from the late 1960s, the value of the RT was \nhigh during the late 1970s and early 1980s but fell back somewhat as the market expanded. \nBy 2000, the local market was quite specialised in hi-tech companies and the value of the RT \nfell below 2 as the dot.com boom collapsed. It has been creeping up since 2002\/2003. The \nabsolute value varies in provincial centres, with Edinburgh, Birmingham and Leeds \nseemingly the most restrictive. But it has been tending to rise in all centres since the mid \n1990s and has only been consistently below a value of 2 in Newcastle, in the relatively \ndepressed North East. \n \nAll these numbers relate to our \u2017central\u2018 estimate but, of course, values of measures on \nalternative assumptions follow similar trends \u2013 just absolute values differ. Perhaps the salient \nfact is that even on the most conservative of all assumptions there is a significant positive \nestimated value for the RT in all locations for recent years. The lowest \u2013 Newcastle \u2013 has a \nvalue of more than 1.6 and most major provincial centres are around 2; London\u2018s West End \nhas had an estimated value of between 4 and 9 since the early 1970s. These are estimated on \nthe most conservative assumptions, so are lowest of bounds, and compare with a value not \nsignificantly different from zero for offices in Manhattan (Table 2).  Moreover, there may be a \ndegree of endogeneity between construction costs and planning restrictiveness. In areas like \nthe City or the West End developers may need an expensive design and a \u2017trophy architect\u2018 to \nget planning permission for buildings offering more rentable space per unit area of the site. In \nNewcastle during the 1980s, the local community may have been so pleased that any \ndeveloper wanted to build that it was correspondingly easier to get permission. This possible \nendogeneity will mean that our central estimate systematically tends to understate the value of \nthe RT rather than overstate it, however, and this should be borne in mind in interpreting the \nalternative estimates and selecting the most plausible. Against this we do find zero values in \nthe least constrained locations (see footnote 10). \n \n5 International Comparison of Regulatory Tax Values  \n \nTable 2 also reports estimated RT values for a number of cities across Europe; Amsterdam, \nBarcelona, Brussels, Frankfurt, Milan, Paris City, Paris La D\u00e9fense and Stockholm. We use \nessentially the same methodology as described above but different data sources (JLL instead \nof CBRE and Gardiner and Theobald instead of Davis Langdon) and have to make a number \nof additional adjustments \u2013 described in Cheshire and Hilber (2007) \u2013 to compute values of \nRT as comparable as possible to the more accurately computed values for British locations. \n \nWe also report RT values for two British office markets for which both Davis Langdon and \nGardiner and Theobald construction cost data are available \u2013 the City of London and London \nWest End. This provides a cross-check on the comparability of estimates. There is only a \nrelatively small difference in estimated values (as the mean of the RT between 1999 and \n2005) for the two markets; 4.5 versus 4.9 for the City and 8.0 versus 8.1 for the West End. \nOverall, the relatively small differences suggest that our estimates for the continental \nEuropean markets are quite comparable to those for the British office markets (see also \nfootnote 8). \n \nWhen we compare our RT estimates for the various European office markets the first result \nthat catches one\u2018s eye is the fact that the two London Markets top the \u2017league table\u2018 with the \nWest End\u2018s RT estimate of 8.0  being more than twice that of any continental European city \nexcept Frankfurt with 4.4. Stockholm and Milan also appear to have comparatively high RT \nvalues with 3.8 and 3.1. This is consistent with anecdotal evidence for these markets. For \nOffice space supply restrictions in Britain: the political economy of market revenge \n \n 20 \nexample, Milan is a very tightly regulated city with strict height restrictions in place. Not \nsurprisingly, suburban locations have started to develop outside Milan; first Milano 2 and \nMilano 3 in the late 1960s and 1970s and now Milano Santa Giulia.  \n \nAs in London, estimated RT values in Paris differ quite substantially within the metro area; \nthey are much higher in the \u2017historic\u2018 City of Paris, where conservation regulations are tight, \nthan they are in La D\u00e9fense, a purpose planned new office and commercial centre on the edge \nof the historic centre. Finally, the city that we had expected to have the lowest RT is indeed at \nthe bottom of the \u2017league table\u2018. Belgium is well known to have a flexible land use regulation \nsystem which imposes little constraint on supply. In Brussels \u2013 despite the rapid increase in \ndemand for office space as a result of the increasing size and influence of the EU institutions - \nwe estimate a low RT of 0.7, although this value is still higher than that estimated by Glaeser \net al (2005) for the office market of Manhattan.  \n \nOverall, the RT comparison for the European office markets suggests (a) that the British \noffice market is by orders of magnitude more supply constrained by regulation than other \noffice markets in Europe and (b) that European cities generally seem to be subjected to tighter \nregulatory restrictions on supply and consequently higher RT values than those found in the \nUnited States. Below, we turn again to the British office markets in an attempt to explain the \ndeterminants of their restrictiveness. \n \n6 The Political Economy of Planning Restrictiveness \n \nIf the estimated value of the RT really represents a measure of the costs of regulatory \nrestrictiveness \u2013 we should be able to model its determinants. As noted above, in areas where \nthere is control of planning policy by local residents \u2013 overwhelmingly owner occupiers \u2013 we \nshould expect a strong resistance to development. Not only are there short run costs to local \nresidents from large scale construction but there are likely to be environmental costs and \nlosses of amenity values. Benefits \u2013 in the form of more jobs or higher wages \u2013 are likely to \naccrue as much to non-residents as to residents given the small size of local government areas \nin the UK. In addition \u2013 re-enforced since the introduction of the UBR in 1990 \u2013 there will be \na powerful fiscal disincentive; even before 1990, the impact on local budgets of business \nproperty development was probably unfavourable because of the high proportion of local \nrevenues coming from central government and rate revenue equalisation across local \ncommunities. Since the introduction of the UBR local communities are, in effect, fined for \nallowing any commercial development so the only incentive for local residents to allow the \ndevelopment of commercial real estate would presumably be perceptions of falling local \nprosperity. This is likely to be most plausibly formulated as fear of job loss and \nunemployment. Not only is unemployment \u2013 at least as measured by the monthly count of the \nunemployed \u2013 immediately available, unlike any other indicator of local prosperity, it is also \nthe focus of real media and political interest. It is not chance that it has been continuously \npublished for both Local Authority Areas and Parliamentary Constituencies since the 1960s. \nIt is the only economic indicator published monthly for Parliamentary Constituencies and the \nHouse of Commons Library even publishes a separate report, Unemployment by Constituency. \nAs one of us put it a long time ago:  \n \n\u2015For as long as there has been interest in the regional problem\u2026..Unemployment \ndifferences have almost been the regional problem; they have certainly been used as \nthe key indicator\u2026\u2016 (Cheshire, 1973 page 1, emphasis in the original) \n \nOffice space supply restrictions in Britain: the political economy of market revenge \n \n 21 \nWe should expect the City of London and Docklands to behave rather differently, however, \nsince in these jurisdictions business interests control planning policy.  The City has a unique \nlocal governing body, the Corporation of the City of London. This is an historic entity and it \nhas been exempt from all the major reforms of local government in the modern era, in \nparticular from both the Municipal Corporations Act of 1835 and the legislation in 1969 \nwhich abolished the \u2017business\u2018 vote. The City is, in effect, a Central Business District with a \nfew thousand residents, so the business electorate (including land owners and property \ncompanies but dominated by financial and other businesses located in the City) controls the \nCorporation, the planning authority for the area. Business voting power is weighted by the \nnumber of employees. The London Docklands Development Corporation (LDDC) was \nestablished in 1981. This was a directly appointed body, not an elected and representative \none, with the specific brief to regenerate the large \u2013 8.5 square miles - derelict port area \nimmediately to the east of the City of London. The LDDC was responsible for all the major \nplanning for the area until it was abolished in 1998 when planning responsibilities reverted to \nthe local Boroughs of London. However, by then, the area had been transformed with the \nmost notable development being Canary Wharf. In total over 2.3 million m\n2\n of office and \nindustrial floor space had been developed.  \n \nGiven, therefore, their different controlling interests we should expect these two planning \nauthorities to be less restrictive of development, other things equal11, and much more \nresponsive to local economic conditions than resident-controlled planning authorities. For any \ngiven (change in the) level of local prosperity, the business controlled LAs would be expected \nto relax their constraints on development substantially more than would the resident \ncontrolled communities. We might, furthermore, expect to observe a change in regulatory \nrestrictiveness as a result of the introduction of the UBR in early 1990, with all other British \noffice locations becoming more restrictive relative to the City of London which, alone, \nretained the capacity to raise revenues locally from business property. \n \nAs noted above the best measure of \u2017local economic prosperity\u2018 would seem to be the \nunemployment rate of residents. It has the additional advantage that it is measurable, if with \nconsiderably more difficulty than might be imagined.12 Because of the difficulties of \nestimating consistent long term time series for local area unemployment rates for our office \nlocations, we experimented with four alternative techniques described in Cheshire and Hilber \n(2007). Appendix Table A4 provides summary statistics of our preferred unemployment rate \nmeasure used in the empirical analysis below. The very reassuring outcome, however, was \n                                                 \n11\n But of course, other things are not equal since the restrictions (in terms of plot ratios, for example) are more or \nless constant across locations but demand for space is not, so a given restriction is more binding where demand \nis greater. This is reflected in the larger location fixed effects observed for the City (Table 3) than for other \nlocations. \n12\n There are two basic sources of data on unemployment in the UK: survey based data, conforming to ILO \nnorms, available from 1973; and count-based, \u2017registration\u2018 data available since the early 20th Century. The \nproblem is that prior to 1999 the sample for the survey based data was too small to give reliable results for local \nplanning authority jurisdictions; and the registration measure is highly sensitive to both the incentives to register \nand rules governing who is actually counted. As unemployment rose from the late 1970s politicians could not \nresist manipulating the unemployment figures (registration data is released very quickly and is what the media \nfocus on) by frequently changing both the incentive to register and the rules governing who was counted. Each \nof the changes had the effect of reducing measured \u2017registered\u2018 unemployment. To estimate unemployment rates \nfor our local government units (representing the Local Planning Authorities) we calculated the ratio of survey to \nregistration unemployment rate for the Government Office regions (NUTS 1) containing the local authority for \neach time period and used that to adjust the registration rate for the local authority area to a quasi-survey based \nvalue. \nOffice space supply restrictions in Britain: the political economy of market revenge \n \n 22 \nthat the basic analytical results were essentially unaffected by the particular series for local \nunemployment used. \n \nIn summary our hypotheses are: \n1. As unemployment rises, planning becomes less restrictive: that is, the RT is supply side \ndetermined; \n2. The supply elasticity of response to unemployment is stronger in business compared to \nresident-controlled LPAs; \n3. The City of London would have become less restrictive relative to all other locations \nfollowing the introduction of the UBR in 1990; \n4. The impact of the UBR on business costs indirectly via the increased fiscal disincentive to \npermit development might have more than offset any property tax reduction. \n \nTable 3 shows the results from our first specification, pooling all 480 observations and \nincluding both year and location fixed effects. We estimate the following: \n \n0 1jt jt jtRT U\uf062 \uf062 \uf065\uf03d \uf02b \uf0b4 \uf02b   (5) \n \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf0290 1 2jt jt B jt R jtRT U D U D\uf062 \uf062 \uf062 \uf065\uf03d \uf02b \uf0b4 \uf0b4 \uf02b \uf0b4 \uf0b4 \uf02b  (6) \n \nWhere: \n \nRT  =  estimated value of Regulatory Tax  \nU  =  estimated British Labour Force Survey-equivalent unemployment rate \nD  =  dummies for B, business controlled, and R, resident controlled local government \nj,t    refer to the location and year \n \nWe show results for five separate versions of the specifications in (5) and (6); in columns 1 \nand 2 we use contemporaneous values of the RT as the dependent variable. Column 1 reports \nresults for the specification outlined in equation (5). We use the unemployment rate of the \nGreater London Area for the City of London, the West End and the Docklands and local \nunemployment rates for the actual nearest equivalent planning authority areas for Croydon \nand Hammersmith and all other non-London office markets.13 All subsequent columns 2 to 5 \nreport results for the unemployment rate interacted with a dummy for business or resident \ncontrol (the estimating specification formulated in equation 6). The models reported in \ncolumns 3 to 5 use a moving average of the RT rather than the contemporaneous measure. \nThis is one attempt to minimise the potential problem created by the RT measure being \ncyclically sensitive. Although in principle the impact of regulatory restrictions should not be \nsensitive to demand shocks, because the price of space is far more sensitive to the cycle than \nare constructions costs, in fact the RT measure is cyclically sensitive. Using moving averages \nof the RT should reduce this effect, albeit at the expense of degrees of freedom. We \nexperiment with 3-, 5- and 7-year moving averages and using them produces the reassuring \nfinding that results are, if anything, stronger. In subsequent tables we focus on the 3-year \nmoving average of the RT as the dependent variable, particularly because we also use 3-year \nmoving averages in the \u2017narrow window\u2018 specifications discussed below and want to maintain \nconsistency. The \u2017narrow window\u2018 estimates provide a more stringent test of the pre- and \npost-1989 changes in the UBR  but to use longer  than a 3-year moving  average would reduce \n                                                 \n13\n In the case of Croydon and Hammersmith we experimented using the unemployment rate for the Greater \nLondon Area. However, the alternative unemployment measure made no difference to our findings. Results are \nreported in Cheshire and Hilber (2007). \nOffice space supply restrictions in Britain: the political economy of market revenge \n \n 23 \nTABLE 3 \nExplaining the Regulatory Tax\u2014Unbalanced Sample with Year Fixed Effects \n(Fixed Effects Model, 1961-2005, all locations) \n \n Dependent Variable: Regulatory Tax Rate (RT) \n \nContemporaneous \n3 year \nmoving av. \n5 year \nmoving av. \n7 year \nmoving av. \nExplanatory Variable (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) \nUnemployment rate in \nlocal office market\n\u2020\n \n-10.936     \n(3.278)***     \nUnemployment rate\n\u2020\n \uf0b4  \nbusiness controlled (bB) \n -27.881 -28.319 -27.937 -26.129 \n (6.017)*** (5.360)*** (4.729)*** (4.169)*** \nUnemployment rate\n\u2020\n  \uf0b4  \nresident controlled (bR) \n -10.531 -9.681 -7.646 -5.610 \n (3.241)*** (2.930)*** (2.647)*** (2.402)*** \nCity of London \n6.187 7.294 7.632 8.066 8.358 \n(0.303)*** (0.446)*** (0.404)*** (0.362)*** (0.326)*** \nLondon West End \n5.280 5.338 5.427 5.606 5.729 \n(0.303)*** (0.299)*** (0.270)*** (0.242)*** (0.218)*** \nLondon Docklands \n(Canary Wharf) \n2.072 3.279 3.486 3.686 3.639 \n(0.483)*** (0.599)*** (0.563)*** (0.549)*** (0.608)*** \nCroydon (Outer Suburban \nLondon) \n0.008 0.031 0.0964 0.242 0.393 \n(0.321) (0.318) (0.287) (0.259) (0.234)* \nLondon Hammersmith \n(Inner Suburban London) \n1.192 1.156 1.256 1.335 1.413 \n(0.374)*** (0.370)*** (0.339)*** (0.313)*** (0.292)*** \nMaidenhead (South East) \n1.131 1.121 1.200 1.389 1.558 \n(0.424)*** (0.419)*** (0.381)*** (0.345)*** (0.315)*** \nReading (South East) \n1.325 1.353 1.436 1.609 1.780 \n(0.348)*** (0.344)*** (0.312)*** (0.283)*** (0.258)*** \nBristol (South West) \n0.153 0.150 0.242 0.374 0.514 \n(0.328) (0.325) (0.292) (0.262) (0.236)** \nBirmingham (West \nMidlands) \n0.984 0.993 0.993 1.023 1.056 \n(0.270)*** (0.267)*** (0.238)*** (0.210)*** (0.186)*** \nLeeds (Yorkshire and \nHumberside) \n0.310 0.310 0.399 0.543 0.679 \n(0.343) (0.339) (0.308) (0.277)* (0.251)*** \nManchester (North West) \n0.979 0.949 0.999 1.007 1.003 \n(0.281)*** (0.278)*** (0.247)*** (0.218)*** (0.194)*** \nEdinburgh (Scotland) \n0.941 0.962 0.999 1.093 1.185 \n(0.311)*** (0.307)*** (0.276)*** (0.247)*** (0.223)*** \nGlasgow (Scotland) \n1.206 1.195 1.194 1.166 1.131 \n(0.275)*** (0.271)*** (0.242)*** (0.214)*** (0.190)*** \nYear Fixed Effects Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes \nConstant \n-2.681 -3.172 -3.271 -3.180 -2.311 \n(0.887)*** (0.889)*** (0.773)*** (0.666)*** (0.580)*** \nObservations 480 480 452 424 396 \nNumber of locations 14 14 14 14 14 \nAdjusted R-squared 0.75 0.76 0.81 0.86 0.90 \nNotes: Standard errors are in parentheses. *** Significant at 1%; ** significant at 5%; * significant at 1%. \nNewcastle is the omitted location.

Local unemployment rates are used for \nCroydon and Hammersmith. Results are virtually unchanged if we use the unemployment rate of the GLA \nfor all five London markets. Results are documented in an earlier working paper version of this study (see \nCheshire and Hilber, 2007). \nOffice space supply restrictions in Britain: the political economy of market revenge \n \n 24 \nthe stringency of the test. Results for the 5- and 7-year moving average specifications for the \nfull balanced sample produce basically the same results and are available from the authors \nupon request. \n \nThe results in Table 3 show a significant negative relationship between local unemployment \nand our measure of planning restrictiveness \u2013 the RT. Moreover, as expected, the estimated \nvalue of the parameter is much larger in the business controlled compared to the resident \ncontrolled locations: the estimated value of the coefficient is three to four times as great in \nabsolute terms in the business controlled locations (in the specifications reported in columns 2 \nto 5 of Table 3) and an F-test shows that these values are significantly different in statistical \nterms. Most location and year fixed effects are statistically significant. A White-test cannot \nreject the null-hypothesis of homoskedasticity, so we report normal standard errors. \n \nThere are two obvious problems with these results. The first is that estimated values of the RT \nbecome possible at different dates for different locations, with less reliable estimates for the \nfirst few years only being available for the City and the West End so our data are less reliable \nand our sample is unbalanced. Thus, the composition of the sample and the implicit weight of \ndifferent locations within it change over time. To address this we restrict the data in all \nsubsequent specifications, reported in Tables 4 and 5, to the 11 locations for which there is \nannual data on a continuous basis since 1973 (see Appendix Table A2 for a list of these 11 \nlocations and Appendix Table A4 for summary statistics of the unemployment rates for this \nsample). \n \nThe second problem is that although we are interpreting local unemployment as a \u2017supply \nside\u2018 variable, operating on the restrictiveness of planning constraints via the local political \nprocess, it could also be interpreted as a \u2017demand side\u2018 measure. We would argue that the real \nevidence in support of our hypothesis that the intensity of constraints imposed is politically \ndetermined and relaxes only under the pressure of unemployment, is not so much that the \ncoefficient on the unemployment rate across all office locations (column 1 in Table 3) is \nhighly significant but that there is much greater sensitivity to unemployment in business \ncontrolled compared to resident controlled locations (columns 2 to 5 in Table 3). \nNevertheless, there is an identification issue perhaps only partly addressed by using the \nmoving average of the RT as the dependent variable. In the subsequent models we therefore \ninclude as direct a measure of demand for office space as we can find, as an additional \nexplanatory variable.  \n \nThe most obvious variable measuring demand for office space is employment growth in \noffice employing sectors. Changes in employment in office sectors is well established in the \nreal estate economics literature as a measure of demand in, for example, models of \u2017take-up\u2018 \nand rents (see, for example, Wheaton et al, 1997, or Hendershott et al, 1999). The r\n2\n between \nannual \u2017take-up\u2018 of office space and change in employment in financial and business service \nsectors in Greater London between 1984 and 2004 was 0.76 (Tsolacos, 2004).14 Since we \nwere aiming to measure a demand side variable, we constructed our office employment series \nfor Local Authority areas and for each of the five London locations individually, rather than \nusing office employment for Greater London as a whole for any of them. There have been \nthree significant changes in industrial classification since 1971 affecting local area \n                                                 \n14\n This does not necessarily imply a strong correlation between growth in office sector employment and the \n\u2017price\u2018 of office space since that relationship is further mediated from take-up to rents and via yields to capital \nvalues. As we observed in the second half of 2007, it is possible to have stable or growing rents but rapidly \nfalling capital values. \nOffice space supply restrictions in Britain: the political economy of market revenge \n \n 25 \nemployment statistics. To minimise the impact of these we constructed two alternative series: \none for a broad definition \u2013 all service employment. The second series is based on a narrower \ndefinition, covering only financial services, banking, public administration and \u2017other\u2018 \nservices and excluding sectors such as distribution which are not primarily office employing \nsectors. Fortunately there is a bridge year available for each change in classification so in \nconstructing the two office employment indices for each location we used this overlap to scale \none series to the next. Details of how these office employment measures were estimated are \navailable in Cheshire and Hilber (2007). We report results for the narrower definition of \nservice employment as this is likely to be more closely related to demand for office space. \nHowever, results for the broad definition are in all cases virtually the same (and are available \nfrom the authors upon request). Summary statistics for the narrow measure of service \nemployment growth used in the empirical analysis are provided in Appendix Table A4. \n \nTables 4 and 5 report the results but now fitted only for a balanced sample of 363 \nobservations (or 349 where the three year moving average of the RT is the dependent \nvariable). The models are as before but now include a control variable for local office \nemployment growth: \n \n0 1 2jt jt jt jtU SRT \uf062 \uf062 \uf062 \uf065\uf03d \uf02b \uf0b4 \uf02b \uf0b4 \uf02b  (7) \n \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf0290 1 2 3 4jt B R B Rjt jt jt jt jtU U S SRT D D D D\uf062 \uf062 \uf062 \uf062 \uf062 \uf065\uf03d \uf02b \uf0b4 \uf0b4 \uf02b \uf0b4 \uf0b4 \uf02b \uf0b4 \uf0b4 \uf02b \uf0b4 \uf0b4 \uf02b  (8) \n \nwhere other variables are as before and S equals the local service employment growth rate. \nTable 4 shows the results first with location but without year fixed effects (columns 1 to 4) \nand, then including both fixed effects (columns 5 to 8). As might be expected the results for \nthe balanced sample are significantly stronger than those for the unbalanced sample and those \nwith year fixed effects are stronger than those without. Columns 1 to 3 and 5 to 7 show results \nfor models using the three year moving average of the RT as the dependent variable and \u2013 for \ncomparison \u2013 columns 4 and 8 show the full model estimated on the contemporaneous value \nof RT. Results are shown for directly comparable models i) excluding and ii) including the \noffice sector employment growth rate as an additional independent variable. Including service \nemployment, whether interacted with the business\/resident control or not, makes no essential \ndifference to the results with respect to the unemployment variable. In all models there is a \nnumerically substantial and statistically significant difference in the size of the estimated \nparameters between business and resident controlled locations. In all models with both \nlocation and year fixed effects this difference is significant at the 1% level. The results for the \noffice employment growth rate are mainly not significant although where they are the \nparameter has the \u2017correct\u2018 positive sign. On balance service sector growth seems to have a \nslightly more significant impact on RT in the resident controlled locations. This is consistent \nwith the supply of office space being on average even more inelastic where residents control \nthe planning process. The results with respect to unemployment are, if anything, even more \nsignificant when the three year moving average of RT is used. \n \nTable 5 shows the results of testing for the introduction of the UBR in a comparable set of \nmodels. As explained above, this change could be expected to have significantly increased the \nfiscal disincentive to permit development for all local communities relative to the City of \nLondon. The new basis for business property taxation came into force in April 1990, although \nit may have been partly anticipated..

White-tests reject the null-\nhypothesis of homoskedasticity in all cases. \n\u2020 \nThe unemployment rate of the Greater London Area is used for the City of London, London West End and \nLondon Docklands.  Local unemployment rates are used for Croydon and Hammersmith and all other non-London office markets. We also estimated \nspecifications using 5 year and 7 year moving averages. The coefficient on the post 1989 dummy variable is virtually unchanged in these cases. \n\u2021\n No moving \naverages of the RT measure are available for 1973 for Bristol, Leeds and Manchester and for 2005 for all locations. \n \nOffice space supply restrictions in Britain: the political economy of market revenge \n \n 28 \n4 report results estimated on data for the whole period with columns 1 to 3 using the three \nyear moving average of RT and with column 4 using the contemporaneous RT. Columns 5 to \n8 show results for exactly comparable models but estimated on just a narrow window of data, \nfive years either side of 1989. This approach ensures a greater focus on the before-after \ntransition (by getting rid of the not-so-informative years) and thereby provides a more \ndemanding test for the hypothesis.16 \n \nComparing the results reported in columns 1 to 3 and 5 to 7 shows that including the office \nemployment growth rate makes no significant difference to the results for the unemployment \nvariable. Now with the post-1989 dummy the model continues to perform well but we \nobserve a significant across the board increase in estimated planning restrictiveness in all \nlocations compared to the City of London from 1989. The results for the \u2017narrow window\u2018 \n(columns 5 to 8) confirm this result. The parameter estimate for the post-1989 dummy is \nrather smaller but still significant at the 1% level for all except the contemporaneous RT \nmeasure where it is only significant at 5%. The rather smaller value of the dummy parameter \nseems intuitively plausible because of the durable nature of real estate. The annual flow of \nnew office space is small relative to the stock even though, since we are looking at \u2017prime\u2018 \noffice space, the flow will be larger relative to the stock than would be the case of all office \nspace. Thus one would expect a change which led all locations except the City of London \nbecoming even more restrictive in their planning policies than previously would have a \ncumulative impact on supply, and so prices, over time. The narrow window excludes changes \nafter 1994 and so is likely to indicate a smaller absolute increase in prices relative to costs (in \nother words in the RT) than when the impact of the UBR is estimated over the whole period \nfor which data are available. Nevertheless, the strong results for the narrow window provide \nuseful and more direct additional evidence supporting the conclusion that the introduction of \nthe UBR generated an even stronger incentive for local communities to restrict office \ndevelopment. \n \nOverall, therefore, these results seem to provide strong support for the interpretations offered \nand reinforce our confidence in the RT as a reasonable measure of the impact of planning \nrestrictiveness on the costs of office space. Although demand and supply may not be fully \nidentified, the most obvious direct measure of demand \u2013 office employment growth \u2013 is \nhardly significant and, when included in the models, has no impact on the estimated effect of \nthe unemployment variable, designed to measure local political pressures for the relaxation of \nplanning restrictiveness. The strongest evidence for the hypotheses, however, is probably \nprovided by the difference in the estimated impact of the unemployment variable depending \non the form of local political control. The estimates show that business controlled planning \nauthorities react significantly more strongly to local unemployment than do resident \ncontrolled authorities and that fiscal (dis)incentives for local communities have the expected \nimpact on permitting development. These results are confirmed whether the contemporaneous \nvalue or a moving average of RT is used as the dependent variable. Since the moving average \nmeasure of RT should minimise the impact of short-term demand shocks this seems to \nprovide further support for the conclusion that values of RT really do reflect drivers of the \nimpact of the supply side restrictions. \n \n                                                 \n16\n Thanks to an anonymous referee for this suggestion. \nOffice space supply restrictions in Britain: the political economy of market revenge \n \n 29 \n7 Conclusions \n \nThe Regulatory Tax measure of the gross costs of land use regulations for occupiers of \nproperty seems to be a useful one. Although it will not reflect certain forms of regulatory \nconstraint, such as compliance costs or costs associated with delays and is, therefore, a lower \nbound measure, the ease with which it can be estimated is a very substantial advantage. In this \npaper, we provide the first estimates for commercial property and show that for office \nbuildings in British cities the RT is substantially larger than it is in comparable continental \nEuropean cities. Despite using different data sources for the international comparison, which \nincludes the City of London and London West End, we get values for the two London \nmarkets that are very comparable. The conclusion is that supply in the British office market, \nlike the British residential sector, is highly constrained by regulation and this costs business \noccupiers a substantial amount. It is, in effect, a tax on office users. Unless space is perfectly \nsubstitutable in production, therefore, there will be further costs in terms of output and \nemployment. \n \nWe argue that such a level of regulatory restriction \u2013 an order of magnitude greater than the \npeak observed in the most restricted sector, in the most restricted markets in the US \u2013 is to be \nexpected given the aims of British planning policy, the form of its instruments, the \nfragmented geographical scale of decision making (which internalises costs associated with \ndevelopment but not benefits), and the fiscal disincentive to local communities to allow \ncommercial development. In this context we would expect differences in regulatory \nconstraints between those authorities controlled by business interests compared to those \ncontrolled by residents. We are fortunate that the creation of the LDDC and the historical \nanomaly of the City of London \u2013 controlled by business interests since the middle ages and \nexempt from all the major reforms of local government of the modern age \u2013 allow us to test \nthis proposition. We find strong evidence that business control makes a significant difference \nto the tightness of regulatory constraints on office building and on the reaction of \nrestrictiveness to local economic prosperity measured by the unemployment rate. Including a \ndirect measure of demand for office space and using a moving average to reduce the effect on \nRT of demand side shocks makes no difference to the central result, reinforcing our \nconclusion that we are observing variation in regulatory constraints \u2013 the supply side. \n \nIt is also possible to test the hypothesis that regulatory restriction responds to fiscal incentives \nand that, in particular, changes in the incentives to allow commercial development resulting \nfrom the introduction of the UBR early in 1990, led to even more restrictive land use \nregulation. This, again, is because the City of London was in large measure protected from the \nchange and continued to be able to levy its own tax on business property. Again, we find \nstrong evidence that the elimination of any fiscal incentive to permit commercial development \nwas associated with an increase in the value of the RT in all other British locations relative to \nthe City of London. This conclusion is confirmed by estimating the models on just a narrow \nwindow of data five years either side of the introduction of the UBR. The UBR, by further \nrestricting the supply of office space, increased its cost.  \n \nTogether these findings support our confidence that the RT measure is really capturing \u2013 or at \nleast closely correlated with \u2013 the gross costs imposed by land use regulation. \n \nOne of the interesting speculations this prompts is about unintended consequences. As \ndiscussed above, the 1980s Conservative government perceived left wing local authorities as \nengaged in a concerted effort to frustrate efforts to increase incentives, privatise state \nOffice space supply restrictions in Britain: the political economy of market revenge \n \n 30 \nindustries, sell off social housing and reduce the total tax take. To finance these efforts to \noffset the adverse and regressive impact central government actions were perceived as having, \nlocal governments were (perceived to be) increasing their tax revenues from the business rate, \nperhaps as part of a punitive anti-business crusade. Central government\u2018s response was to \nintroduce the UBR. This removed control of business property taxes from local communities, \nturning business property taxes into a national tax. It managed, therefore, not only to \neliminate all tax revenue gains to local communities from commercial real estate development \nbut to make this fact perfectly transparent. Nevertheless, local governments continued to have \na legal obligation to provide services to local businesses. So it produced a powerful and \ntransparent fiscal disincentive for local communities to permit any commercial development.  \n \nOver time, our results suggest, this has restricted the supply of offices and pushed up the \nvalue of the RT. The increase in business costs this represents may more than offset any costs \nthat might realistically have been imposed by old-style left wing councils attempting to raise \nmoney from local business rates; especially given the demise of old-style left wing councils \nthat occurred between 1989 and the present. \n  \nTABLE 6 \nEffect of the Introduction of the Uniform Business Rate \non a Medium Size Office Firm with 1500m\n2\n Space Usage  \n \n Increase in Annual Occupation Cost \n \nBased on  \n3 Year Moving Average RT  \n(Table 5\u2014Column 3) \nBased on  \nContemporaneous RT \n(Table 5\u2014Column 4) \nOffice Market in 1989 \u00a3 in 2005 \u00a3 in 1989 \u00a3 in 2005 \u00a3 \nLondon West End 59823 89555 56119 84010 \nCroydon 62794 94003 58906 88182 \nReading 47251 70736 44326 66356 \nBristol 45529 68158 42710 63937 \nBirmingham 41702 62428 39120 58562 \nLeeds 41988 62857 39388 58965 \nManchester 48639 72813 45627 68304 \nNewcastle 56926 85219 53401 79942 \nEdinburgh 36528 54683 34267 51297 \nGlasgow 38143 57100 35781 53564 \nAverage (all markets) 47932 71755 44964 67312 \n \nIndeed, we can quantify this effect because of the fortunate fact that the City of London alone \nwas given a partial exemption from the UBR. Consider a medium sized firm with about 200 \nemployees. We assume that the firm uses an office building of 1,500 m\n2\n. This is about the \nsmallest office building that can realistically accommodate 200 employees.17 We first ask the \nquestion of how much in UBR such a company would be paying annually, to have a \nbenchmark against which to compare our results. This calculation is based on an existing \nfirm\/office building in the London Borough of Camden that matches our above brief. The \n                                                 \n17\n Based on the London Employment Sites Database (Roger Tym & Partners, 2005) the space usage in Inner \nLondon is 19 m\n2 \nper office job, suggesting an office building of 3,800 m\n2\n for a medium size firm with 200 \nemployees. Hence, our assumption of 1,500 m\n2 \nis a very conservative one, implying that we are underestimating \nrather than overestimating the regulation induced increase in annualised occupation cost. \nOffice space supply restrictions in Britain: the political economy of market revenge \n \n 31 \nbuilding is located at 7\/8 Greenland Place, London, NW1 0AP and in 2005 had a rateable \nvalue of \u00a3112,250 with the rate multiple set at 42.6p so the firm had a liability for UBR of \n\u00a347,819. \n \nNext we explore the (estimated) effect of the UBR on the price of office space via increasing \nthe RT. Our computations are based on the most conservative and, we believe, most accurate \nestimates for the entire balanced sample period (columns 3 and 4 in Table 5): that is a post-\n1989 dummy value of either 0.646 or 0.606. Although the estimated impact of the UBR on \nour RT measure in our various markets relative to the City of London is assumed to be \nuniform (in effect a mean for all markets), the impact on the price of office space in \u00a3s in any \ngiven location will vary because the RT is expressed as a quasi-tax relative to MCC, which \nvaries across markets.   \n \nTable 6 illustrates the estimated effect of the UBR on the annual occupation cost of a \nhypothetical office building of 1,500 m\n2\n (relative to the City of London) for the two \nalternative estimates of the post-1989 dummy. We use market specific yields in 1989 to \ntransform changes in capital values to changes in annual rent cost or (assuming that other \noccupation cost are constant) occupation cost, respectively. \n \nWe report the estimated impact both in 1989 terms (when the UBR was introduced) and in \n2005 terms, using the Consumer Price all items Index to adjust the values. The latter figure \nallows us to compare the regulatory cost imposed by the UBR to the UBR tax itself, that is, \n\u00a347, 819 per year for a 1,500 m\n2 \noffice building in Camden. As is illustrated in Table 6, the \nestimated positive impact of the UBR on annual occupation cost is greater across all markets \nand both specifications, compared to our benchmark UBR tax estimate.  \n \nThus the implication is that moving to the UBR far from having the intended effect of \nreducing business costs had the perverse effect of increasing them. The law of unintended \nconsequences is powerful indeed. \n \n \nReferences \n \nBarker, K.
