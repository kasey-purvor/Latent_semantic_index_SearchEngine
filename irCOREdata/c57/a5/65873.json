The transferred pattern is subject to undesirable dif-\nfraction effects unless mask\/substrate flatness and align-\nment precision are tightly controlled. In extending\nphotolithography to the patterning of nonplanar substrates,\nthe minimum feature size is limited by diffractive line\nbroadening; for example, the minimum pitch for line tracks\ntraversing a 54-deg sloping sidewall of an anisotropically\netched 350-\u0001m-thick silicon wafer is limited1 by conven-\ntional photomask imaging to around 40 \u0001m.\nThe photolithographic process can be made more robust\nto variations in substrate height by compensating for dif-\nfractive line broadening in the mask pattern, i.e., reducing\nthe mask line-width in step with mask-substrate separation.\nThis approach has been demonstrated by patterning\n140-\u0001m-pitch electrical connections over a 500-\u0001m-high\npiezoelectric print head actuator2 but is limited to small\nvariations in substrate height due to degradation of the side-\nwall slope of the developed photoresist.\nDiffraction is employed advantageously in the pattern-\ning of planar substrates by the use of model-based optical\nproximity correction \u0001OPC\u0002 techniques in which the mask\npattern is predistorted such that the projected image more\nclosely matches the desired shapes.3 A similar approach can\nused for 3-D photolithography, as has been used for imag-\ning a line on a sloping surface.4 In this instance the mask\nconstitutes a computer-generated hologram \u0001CGH\u0002.\nThe structure considered here is a bihelix consisting of a\npair of nonplanar curves following a conical substrate \u0001Fig.\n1\u0002. This geometry has potential for use in ultrawideband\nantennas or inductors. Patterning methods adopted hitherto\nfor these grossly nonplanar substrates are based on rotation\nof the substrate during direct laser patterning5 or by wrap-\nping flexible circuit boards around a mandrel.6 Provided the\ndepth of field can be sufficiently extended, photolithogra-\nphy is potentially superior to these sequential or direct\n1537-1646\/2007\/$25.00 \u00a9 2007 SPIE\nFig. 1 Nonplanar photolithography system: \u0002=16.5 deg is the cone\nhalf-angle, z0=8.4 mm is the exposure offset, r1=1 mm is the initial\nhelix radius, and \u0003=74.2 deg is the wrap angle of the helix.\nJ.

We envisage\nthat this nonplanar photolithography method will enable\nmany novel patterning strategies.\n2 Mask Computation\nThe CGH mask is the key component of the system be-\ncause it defines the projected 3-D light distribution by\nmodulating the incident wavefront. Since our current inter-\nest lies in nonplanar surfaces, an efficient method for find-\ning a suitable CGH mask is to restrict calculation to only\nthe surface of interest. Simplification of the problem is pos-\nsible by decomposing the object into line segments and\nsuperimposing individual CGHs representing each line.\nThe CGH for each line takes the mathematical form\nH\u0001x ,y\u0002=exp \u0001i\u0004y2 \/\u0005z\u0002, where \u0001x ,y\u0002 are the coordinates in\nthe hologram plane, \u0005 is the exposure wavelength, and z is\nthe distance between the hologram and the object.7\nOur strategy is based on direct modulation of the line\nCGH equation, although more complex generalized\nschemes have been reported for achieving generalized focal\ncurves.\n8 The device\u2019s bihelical geometry is described by\ntwo parameters, z\u0006, the angle-dependent distance between\nthe hologram and the focal plane, and R\u0006, the radial loca-\ntion of the line:\nR\u0006 = r1 exp \u0001a\u0006\u0002 z\u0006 = z0 +\nR\u0006\ntan \u0002\n\u00011\u0002\nwhere a=sin \u0002 \/ tan \u0003 \u0001see Fig. 1\u0002.\nFor each helical line of the bihelix device, a quantized\nCGH distribution H\u0001r ,\u0006\u0002 is computed in polar coordinates:\nH\u0001r,\u0006\u0002 = \u0003exp \u0004i \u0004\u0005z\u0006 \u0001r \u2212 R\u0006\u00022\u0005 if \u0006r \u2212 R\u0006\u0006\u0007 L2 ,0 otherwise \u0007 \u00012\u0002\nwhere the second line of the bihelix is obtained by a rota-\ntion of 180-deg about the z axis. The localized width of the\nmodulated region is limited according to parameter L such\nthat aliasing of the mask pattern does not occur for the\nchosen pixel size p. The required limiting function is deter-\nmined by examining the local spatial frequency in Eq. \u00012\u0002:\nL = \b\n\u0005z\np\n\u00010\u0007 \b\u0007 1\u0002 , \u00013\u0002\nwhere \b can be used to restrict the CGH width to a fraction\nof the alias limit. This approach is particularly suited to\nmany device-level applications, where the following can be\nassumed: H\u0001r ,\u0006\u0002 has a smoothly varying depth function\n\u0001z\u0006\u0002, the resist thickness compared to linewidth effects is\nsmall, and surface reflections do not strike the substrate.\nIt can be shown using the stationary phase method that\nthe reconstructed image is a good approximation to the de-\nsired curve,8 whereby small segments of the curve are re-\nproduced by converging cylindrical wavefronts. These\nmeso-optical diffractive elements utilize zero-order light in\nthe reconstructed lines, hence keeping the light intensity\nhigh and minimizing the exposure time. The strategy for\nnonplanar lithography is to arrange for each line CGH to\nfollow the surface of the substrate. Simple circuit geom-\netries are thus encoded in the exposure mask, complete\nwith depth information.\nAt its simplest, the mask is realized as a binary ampli-\ntude pattern \u0001\b0,1\t e.g., chrome-on-glass\u0002. A binary phase\npattern \u0001\b0,\u0004\t, e.g., etched glass\u0002 offers a factor of 4 in-\ncrease in peak intensity. Yet more advanced representations\ncan be used to improve the line profile and may involve\nmultilevel phase and amplitude. The CGH mask configura-\ntion adopted here comprises an array of pixels \u0001p\n=10 \u0001m\u0002 encoded by a combination of two-level phase and\namplitude blocking. Blocking is used in regions that lie\noutwith the localized radial width L \bEq. 2\t. Due to the\ntight radius of curvature toward the tip of the cone, over-\nlapping can occur in the CGH pattern between successive\nturns of the helix, leading to nulls in the intensity pattern\nwhen binary representations are used. Within the constraint\nof a binary phase CGH configuration, the localized radial\nwidth was restricted by setting \b=0.75.\nFor a small section of the reconstructed helical track, the\ncross-sectional intensity profile can be approximated by a\nsinc2 function.4 The full width at half height W of this\nfunction on the sloping surface is approximated by\nW \n\n\u0005z\nL sin \u0002\n. \u00014\u0002\nIf the CGH segment width L is restricted according to Eq.\n\u00013\u0002, then Eq. \u00014\u0002 becomes independent of z and fixed for a\nconstant value of \b.\nThe magnitude of the sinc2 function is, however, depen-\ndent on z, hence the width of the actual line imaged into\nphotoresist will vary with z. We previously described en-\nhancements to our CGHs in which control of the linewidth\nand termination on planar substrates can be enhanced.9 It is\nanticipated that similar enhancements can be achieved for\ntracks on nonplanar substrates, possibly by the use of 3-D\ndirect transforms or iterative methods.10,11\n3 Demonstration\nThe expanded beam from a spatially filtered diode laser\n\u0001403 nm, 50 mW\u0002 was collimated to provide a beam of\ndiameter 2.5 cm with less than 5% intensity variation. The\nextent of the uniform beam region could be increased by\nusing, for example, refractive beam shaping,12 however for\nsimplicity, the central portion of the expanded Gaussian\nbeam was used here. Speckle effects were not a significant\nissue in this configuration.\nBinary phase shift masks \u0001PSMs\u0002 are used in submi-\ncrometer lithography to enhance the patterning of dense\nstructures.3 Our binary phase CGH could be manufactured\nin the same way, by etching of a glass mask blank, but for\npractical reasons, we chose instead to create the necessary\nphase shifts by selective removal of a transparent layer de-\nposited on top of the photomask substrate. A standard\nchrome on glass mask blank was first patterned with the\namplitude blocking layer. A 400-nm layer of polymethyl-\nmethacrylate \u0001PMMA\u0002 with a refractive index n=1.5 was\nthen spin coated on top of the patterned mask blank. The\nPurvis et al.: Photolithographic patterning of bihelical tracks\u2026\nJ. Micro\/Nanolith. MEMS MOEMS Oct\u2013Dec 2007\/Vol. 6\u00014\u0002043015-2\nPMMA layer was then etched in an oxygen plasma, using a\nthick patterned photoresist as the etch mask, to generate the\nrequired \u0004 rad phase shift layer \bFig. 2\u0001a\u0002\t.\nThe photoresist-coated substrate must be aligned to the\nmask with respect to all six degrees of freedom for 3-D\nlithography. Coarse z alignment can be achieved using a\nmechanical spacer. For a fine alignment, zone plates are\nemployed around the periphery of the mask \u0001see Fig. 1\u0002 to\nproject light spots that can be made to coincide with fidu-\ncial marks on the substrate. In a basic realization, the same\nlight source is used for exposure and alignment with a shut-\nter shielding the active substrate. Alternatively, a second\nlight source with a wavelength to which the photoresist is\nnot sensitive can be used for alignment, provided an appro-\npriate zone plate scale change is made.\nA prerequisite for chemically processing the substrates is\nthe uniform deposition of a photoresist layer. Common\nmethods such as spin coating and lamination result in non-\nuniform films and voids when applied to nonplanar sur-\nfaces. Effective spray coating of the photoresist can be\nachieved over moderate topographies of a few hundred mi-\ncrometers, but for grossly nonplanar surfaces a better\nmethod is to use an electrodepositable photoresist2 \u0001EDPR\u0002.\nHere we applied a 5-\u0001m layer of positive acting EDPR\n\u0001Rohm and Haas PEPR2400\u0002 to a glass-ceramic cone pre-\ncoated with a 1-\u0001m electroless nickel seed layer. Following\nexposure and development of the EDPR, a buildup process\nwas used in which 2-\u0001m gold was electroplated into the\ndeveloped pattern. The EDPR and nickel seed layer were\nthen stripped to leave the required track geometry.\n4 Results\nUsing the methods already described, the imaging of bihe-\nlical curves onto the cone was performed \bFig. 3\u0001a\u0002\t. Sub-\nsequent processing resulted in tracks over the entire 22-mm\nheight of the substrate \bFigs. 3\u0001b\u0002 and 3\u0001c\u0002\t. Despite a\nnearly twofold intensity variation between the top and the\nbase of the cone \bFigs. 2\u0001b\u0002 and 2\u0001d\u0002\t and a rough substrate\nsurface \u0001Ra=2 \u0001m\u0002, it was possible to determine photore-\nsist exposure and processing conditions that enable the full\nspiral to be imaged. The mean linewidth was 62 \u0001m \u000110\nsample points each at the top, middle, and base of cone,\nstandard deviation\t9 \u0001m\u0002. This is larger than the value of\n42 \u0001m predicted by Eqs. \u00013\u0002 and \u00014\u0002 because in this in-\nstance, the photoresist exposure threshold corresponded to\na value less than the half height of the sinc2 intensity dis-\ntribution. As with normal photolithography, the minimum\nline width for 3-D photolithography is dependent on the\nmask resolution and illumination wavelength.\nThe results presented here are far beyond the normal\ncapabilities of photolithography and we foresee many ap-\nplications for this novel nonplanar patterning technique in\nthe fields of microelectromechanical systems \u0001MEMS\u0002 and\nelectronics packaging.\nFig. 2 Bihelical CGH and resulting images: \u0001a\u0002 schematic represen-\ntation of a portion of the binary phase CGH for projecting a double\nhelix onto a cone; \u0001b\u0002 to \u0001d\u0002 false color CCD images and intensity\ncross sections obtained at CGH-CCD separations corresponding to\n\u0001b\u0002 top \u0001z=10 mm\u0002, \u0001c\u0002 middle \u0001z=21 mm\u0002, and \u0001d\u0002 base \u0001z\n=32 mm\u0002 of the cone.
