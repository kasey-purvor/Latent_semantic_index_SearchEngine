Women are the bearers, \nand in most societies the primary nurturers of children. This means that \nreproductive technologies are of particular significance to them.\u201d (Wajcman \n1991:54) \n \nIn general, I would argue that there is much value in revisiting issues such as \nfoetal imaging, since the significance of this increasingly mainstream \ntechnology and the images it produces can sometimes get lost in the \nexcitement over new technologies, particularly in relation to genetics. More \ndirectly, with the advent of 4D ultrasound images, the public image of the \nfoetus has again come to the fore in contemporary society and led to renewed \npolitical debate about abortion and women\u2019s right to choose (Lee 2006). As \nsuch, the work of feminist writers to make sense of this iconic image remains \ncontinually relevant, as well as offering lessons for thinking about other \nassociated technologies.  \n \nIn debates over abortion, the foetus and the woman have been continually \npositioned as antagonists. Given the stakes involved in such debates about \npersonal integrity, individual responsibility, life and death, it is no wonder that \nmany radical feminist authors have concentrated on refocusing the attention \non women and away from the disembodied foetus (Michaels 1999:113). Such \n 2 \nwriters have worked hard to decode and deconstruct the public foetus in our \nmidst and have mobilised interpretative tools such as cultural criticism to \ncontextualise the production and consumption of foetal images. Duden\u2019s book \nis an important and interesting contribution to this effort, which is still taken up \nby authors writing in this field (For example, Michaels 1999, Haraway 2000; \nRapp 2000).  As Sawicki notes, the work of radical feminist writers (such as \nDuden) has played an important role in \u201cincreasing scientific and technical \nliteracy amongst feminists\u201d, bringing the psychological and political risks of \nsuch technologies to the attention of a wider public and \u201cprovoking other \noppositional discourses that can be further developed and used to resist their \ndangerous implications\u201d (Sawicki 1991:70).  \n \nDuden\u2019s strategy is to seek to remind us (and in particular those who are \ninvolved in reproductive medicine) that pregnancy is concentrated in the \nembedded pregnant woman rather than the disembodied \u201cpublic foetus\u201d and \nshe attempts to retrieve the embodied woman as the site of pregnancy \nthrough what Michaels has termed a \u201cfetal disappearing act\u201d (Michaels \n1999:120). Whilst this may create as many problems for women as it resolves \n(as I will discuss later), I would argue that, while the \u201cpublic foetus\u201d continues \nto loom large in the politics of abortion and women\u2019s positions in relation to \nthe new reproductive technologies remain contested, Duden\u2019s work remains \nimportant in the continuing debate about how women\u2019s reproductive freedom \ncan be continually re-negotiated and re-established. \n \n 3 \nThe Expansion of a Horizoni \nDuden draws together a number of strands of scientific, religiousii, political \nand cultural thought in her argument to present a powerful expression of the \nalienation of the pregnant woman from her own body \u2013 something she terms \n\u201cskinning\u201d. I will seek to draw out a number of those strands and examine \nthem critically. Firstly, I will examine what Duden means when she refers to \nwomen\u2019s \u201cfelt experience of pregnancy\u201diii I will then move on to look at her \ncritique of the medicalisation of pregnancy through the scientific and political \ncreation and management of a foetal population. An important part of this is \nwhat Duden terms the \u201cpublic foetus\u201d, by which she means the way in which \nthe increasing visibility of the image of the foetus has affected pregnant \nwomen\u2019s view of their own bodies. It is worth commenting at this stage, that \nthere is a considerable overlap between the two strands of medicine and \nculture and that each is mobilised to reinforce the other. \n \n \u201cThe Quickening\u201div: \nAlthough this does not become clear from her article in Science and Culture \n(Duden 1993b), in her book, Duden sets up a form of historical comparison to \nreveal the intimate bodily experience that she feels that women have lost and \nto demonstrate how the control and expression of pregnancy has been \nshaped by modern visual technology; firstly of the x ray and the photograph \nthen increasingly by the institution of the foetal sonogram or ultrasound \nimage. In brief, she seeks to persuade the reader that because of the \npredominance of the ultrasound image in modern pregnancy, vision has \nbecome the primary sensory experience of the pregnant womanv. The \n 4 \nconsequence of this is that she fears that pregnant women have lost the \nability to feel or communicate the more intangible emotions and experiences \nof pregnancy and their experience of pregnancy has been restricted by the \nfact that they are forced to see, represent and imagine that which was \npreviously unseen (Duden 1993a:8). \n \nDuden describes the history of the unbornvi as until relatively recently the \nhistory of the unseen, the invisible. She notes that the unborn was never there \nwith any certainty and could be described as a \u201cnot yet\u201d \u2013 a peculiar non-\ntemporal dimension more usually culturally associated with intangible bodies \nsuch ghosts and angels (Duden 1993a:9). Thus for Duden\u2019s historical woman, \npregnancy was ultimately a \u201ctentative\u201dvii experience in its early stages (Duden \n1993a:83).  \n \nTo demonstrate her point, Duden enters into a dialogue with the past to \nexpose the hiatus between woman\u2019s historical experience of pregnancy and \nthat of the modern woman using a number of historical accounts of pregnancy \nrecorded in the notes of a German doctor, Johann Storch. She relates that \nprior to the institution of the clinical gaze in the Enlightenment period (and \nmore recently the new visual technologies available to doctors), a doctor \nentered into a discourse with the female patient to discover her symptoms and \nunderstanding of her own body. The testimony given by the woman was taken \nin through the doctor\u2019s ears not his eyes and the resulting diagnosis and \ntreatment was a combination of imagination and experience that was \nunderstood by both parties. The descriptions given by these historical women \n 5 \nare blindly sensual in their nature. They speak of ebbing and flowing, rushing \nand heat. Influenced by this, Duden describes the historical pregnancy as a \nhaptic or sensory state of woman known only to others through her own \ntestimony. She states that pregnancy was matter of \u201cimpenetrable female \nintimacy\u201d, which only became positively known to a woman (and the public at \nlarge) through \u201cquickening\u201d (inner felt experience), felt by her alone and \npublicly announced by her. Prior to quickening, women were not definitively \nconsidered to be pregnant. \n \nIn comparison to this gradual sensory awareness of the historical woman, \nDuden notes that the modern woman learns of her pregnancy initially through \na chemical test, the results of which are re-enforced when ultrasound screen \ninvades her interior and presents her with a \u201cpicture\u201d of the foetus. Through \nthe advance of visual technology, which has facilitated the pushing back of \nthe visual boundaries, Duden writes despairingly that \u201cthe hope represented \nby the unseen in history has now been dissolved into expectationviii that can \nbe managed at will, scientifically, sociologically and arbitrarily.\u201d (Duden \n1993a:10).  \n \nThis question as to whether ultrasound is a source of empowerment and \nincreased knowledge about the foetus (for the expectant parents and the \nmedical profession) or merely a means of moving the ownership of knowledge \nfrom lay to expert hands has been addressed by feminist anthropologists such \nas Saetnan (2000) and Rapp (2000). ix Saetnan agrees with Duden that the \nultrasound scan is presented to women as more knowledgeable about their \n 6 \nbodies than they are themselves. However, interestingly Saetnan notes that \nthis did not undermine women\u2019s confidence in their own knowledge of their \nbodies. The women in her study did not allow the scan to usurp their self-\nknowledge. However, neither did they reject the ultrasound results entirely, \ninstead they found ways of integrating their two narratives into one whole \n(Saetnan 2000:351).x.  \n \nRapp\u2019s work on amniocentesis would seem more strongly to support Duden\u2019s \nargument in that she found that foetal imagery has changed women\u2019s \nperceptions of pregnancy and that \u201cfor most women, internal images of their \npregnancies had been refocused through the lens of sonography, eclipsing \nany less standardized embodied notions of what the [foetus] felt like. Their \ninternal states were now technologically redescribed\u201d (Rapp 2000:125). \nRapp\u2019s study seems to confirm Duden\u2019s anxieties about pregnancy no longer \nbeing individual and private but also becoming public and political through the \nuse of ultrasound technology and the prevalence of the foetal image in public, \ncultural and political life. This does not mean that women necessarily accept \nmedical authority and Rapp found that, even in situations where women \nreceive a diagnosis of foetal abnormality, interpretative flexibility could remain \nand women still can and sometimes do, \u201copt off the medical conveyor belt\u201d \ndeclining further tests or abortion when one test has shown suspicious results \n(Rapp 2000). However, she recognises the use of such technology by the \nmedical profession to stake their claim to authority over the foetus (Rapp \n2000:121) and that is the next aspect of Duden\u2019s work that I would like to \nconsider. \n 7 \nMedicalisation and the \u201cPublic Foetus\u201d \n \n\u201cI don\u2019t think they can hear me\u2026.and I\u2019m nearly sure they can\u2019t see me. I feel \nas if I were invisible\u201d (Carroll 1997) \n \nFrom the approval implicit in Duden\u2019s accounts of Dr Storch\u2019s interaction with \nhis female patients, it would seem that she is not opposed to medical \nintervention in pregnancy per se. However, she is concerned that the power \nover the experience of pregnancy has swung decisively away from women in \nfavour of the rights of the foetus. The way in which she sees this shift taking \nplace is through the increasingly public predominance of the visualisation of \nthe autonomous foetus from an early stage in pregnancy, the removal of the \nbody of pregnant woman from the visual and cultural discourses and the \nconsequent call for an increase in the medical management of pregnancy.  \n \nTo turn firstly to the increasing public visibility of foetal images, the first sight \nof the embryo and foetus in the media has been traced back by Duden to \nLennart Nilsson\u2019s photographs published in Time magazine in the 1960s.xi \nThe irony of these images, which were hailed as a first glimpse beyond the \nboundary of the female body, as pictures of new life, is that they were in fact \nintensely stage-managed photographs of dead embryos made available to \nNilsson after they had been aborted (Newman 1996). However, at the time of \npublication, this irony passed unremarked and the highly emotive photographs \nwere quickly seized upon by anti abortion activists as powerful tools in their \ncampaign to politicise debates around the body of the pregnant woman \n(Petchesky 1987; Newman 1996). The power of these photographs lay in part \n 8 \nin the fact that they could be interpreted through a common cultural \nexperience without the need for an underlying expert medical discourse. This \nis not the case with ultrasound. \n \nUnlike Nilsson\u2019s photographs, the image produced by the ultrasound has \nbeen described by Duden as a \u201ccloudy chimera\u201d (Duden 1993a:565). \nAlthough the most recent breakthrough in technology enables the production \nof very clear images of the foetus, at the time Duden was writing, the images \nproduced by ultrasound could only be understood when mediated through \nmedical discourse. However as with Nilsson\u2019s photographs, these images \nhave been appropriated by the media and by specific political groups and \nthrough the collapsing of the two images \u2013 the photograph and the ultrasound \nimage \u2013 into one another, they have been invested with the powerful aura of a \nportrait (Petchesky 1987; Taylor 1993) through their designation as showing \nthe existence of new life. Duden terms this powerful image \u201cthe public foetus\u201d. \nIt is implicit in Duden\u2019s argument that it is not merely the ability of medical \nscience to produce the image through ultrasound that has resulted in the \nalienation of the pregnant woman, rather it is the fact that the image has been \ncommandeered by a particular political group and widely disseminated \nthroughout the media within a specific cultural and political framework \n \nDuden expresses this concern clearly when she states that the \u201cscientifically \nestablished facts pertaining to conception and birth have been graphically \npublicised by the media and thereby transformed into material for public \nevents. The seemingly tangible reality appears in photographs or is pointed \n 9 \nout by TV experts taking on in the process a meaning beyond the purely \nmedical\u201d (Duden 1993a:51). In other words, she is concerned that the foetal \nimage has been invested with cultural and political meaning through the \ninterplay of imagination, political and religious discourses and media \nrepresentation. It has gained a cultural meaning beyond its medical \nusefulness and come to represent life. Ultrasound images have assisted in \nthis creation of life not only through the production of the image itself but also \nthrough the fact that they can be watched in real time like a video or television \n(Duden 1993; Franklin et al 2000). This ability to see ultrasound images in \nreal time re-enforces the impression of truth. It\u2019s there, you can see it, it must \nbe real (Duden 1993a:575). Duden persuasively suggests that the visibility of \nthe foetal image has permitted a further re-writing of the meaning of life itself \nas the boundaries of the visible horizon are moved back through the medium \nof the ultrasound from the time of birth to the time of conception. \n \nThe ease with which this has taken place and been accepted has been \nattributed in feminist discourses to be due to a combination of factors; the \npower of the image, a privileging of enlightenment notions of rights bearing \nsubjects and the absence of the mother from the picture. Duden mobilises a \nnumber of these discourses to present her argument. She suggests that the \n(inadvertent) erasure of the mother, in Nilsson\u2019s photographs and through the \nway in which the ultrasound is set up, has provided the emotional and political \nmeans for the interests of foetus to be seen in opposition in medical and legal \nterms to its mother (see also Haraway 2000). The Foetus is not seen in \nconnection with the pregnant woman and thus can be represented as a \n 10 \nunique rights bearing subject \u2013 an autonomous being. Duden argues that the \nproliferation of these disembodied images into the public consciousness \nmeans that when women look at an ultrasound image of their interior in real \ntime, they superimpose the image of the \u201cpublic foetus\u201d onto the shadows on \nthe screen and interiorise all that that \u201ccultural icon\u201d has come to mean in \ncontemporary discourses (Petchesky 1987:62). \n \nIt has been argued elsewhere that the rise of visual productions of knowledge \nfacilitates the blurring of the boundaries between the medical, social, political \nand cultural as scientific looking is inevitably always caught up in culturally \ninfluenced forms of looking (Franklin et al 2000:279). For Duden, the way in \nwhich the medical technology of the ultrasound has been appropriated by \ndiscourses outside medicine is the ultimate example of the way in which a \nkind of medical looking and a medical artefact can become invested with \npublic meaning and cultural desires. \n \nDuden is disturbed by the willingness of women to accept the prevalent \ndiscourses surrounding the public foetus and by doing so also accepting what \nthey see on the ultrasound as a life. She terms this apparent willingness to \nsee what we are told to see \u201cvision on command\u201d (Duden 1993a:568). She \nargues perceptively that the post-modern generation is culturally trained to \ndissociate vision (passive looking) from sight (active looking). She notes that \nmodern women are socialised by a plethora of visual images in their everyday \nlife and become habituated to seeing what they are told that they see rather \nthan bringing their own images and experience to an interpretation of the \n 11 \nimage before them. She argues that the tendency of the post-modern \ngeneration to see what they are told is particularly acute when the images are \npresented in a medical context and backed by the authority of science.  \n \nInherent also in Duden\u2019s concept of \u201cvision on command\u201d within the intimate \nspace of pregnancy is the confident authority of the clinical gaze. Duden \nproceeds from the assumption shared by much feminist writing that the bio-\nmedical profession still adheres to the positivistic Enlightenment views of truth \nproduction identified by Foucault (Foucault 1978 & 1980; Oakley 1987; \nNewman 1996; Franklin et al 2000; Taylor 1998). The consequence of this for \nDuden is that pregnant women tend to be accepting of the underlying medical \nassertion that the clinical gaze aided by the ultrasound produces a more \ntruthful, authoritative knowledge of the foetus than the vague sensory \nexplanation of her pregnancy that could be provided by the woman herself.xii \nThrough the clinical gaze read off from the ultrasound image and analysed \nthrough the filter of scientific knowledge and experience, the medical expert \ncan determine size, stage of development and (hopefully)xiii identify any \ninherent abnormalities, information that the pregnant woman could not provide \nfrom her own experience. \n \nHowever, Duden notes that in medical terms alone, ultrasound diagnoses in \nrespect of abnormality have been wrong sufficiently often to raise the question \nas to why it remains the predominant technology in antenatal care and \nsomething that most women will be subjected to at least once during \npregnancy.xiv This is where, for Duden, the \u201cPublic Foetus\u201d again comes into \n 12 \nplay. She argues that ultrasound remains popular because of the foetus is no \nlonger just a medical image but also a cultural image, one for Duden, which \nrepresents the invasion of the medical and political into the private space of \nthe pregnant woman. The fact that the image has also been utilised by non \nmedical advertisements signifying special care for the body by evoking the \nauthority of scientific knowledge appears to re-enforce Duden\u2019s argument of \nthe power of the foetal image (Taylor 1993). Other writers have taken this \nargument further or presented it in a different way. \n \nPetchesky has noted that the ultrasound \u201cpicture\u201d has become a cultural right \nof passage in Western societies through which women and their families get \ntheir first \u201cportrait\u201d of their child for the baby book. In this way, the image of the \nfoetus could be seen to represent a scientific image translated not only into a \ncultural and public artefact but also into a personal context, a context which it \nseems Duden is reluctant to address. (Duden in her case study of \u201cJoanne\u201d \nskates over the issue of attachment to the foetal image in a personal way very \nbriefly). Further, although Duden does not deal in any detail with this effect of \nthe image, other writers have discussed the question of bonding and the \nsuggested power of ultrasound to encourage emotional bonding much more \nthan a textual description of the foetus ever could (Petchesky 1987; Taylor \n1998, Franklin et al 2000). The issue of the personal value of the ultrasound in \nthis way is addressed specifically by Taylor who examines how the image is \nsaid to provide paradoxically reassurance and the opportunity for the pregnant \nwoman to bond with her child to be.  \n \n 13 \nWhilst Rapp\u2019s study takes up this aspect of power of the foetal image and the \nway in which the viewing of such images is orchestrated, she also recognises \nthe complexities of the image when she notes that, \u201cSurely, neither pregnant \nwomen and their supporters nor members of the right to life movement are \nthinking about the embedded, reductive and normalising aspects of imaging \ntechnology as they \u201cmeet\u201d a baby on a television monitor for the first time\u201d \n(Rapp 2000:119). She agrees with Duden that foetal imagery has changed \nthe ways in which women think about pregnancy and respond to the anxiety \nof grading, normalising and controlling pregnancy. However, she argues that \nthis anxiety is multilayered as it feeds upon older, more existential fears about \nthe tenuousness of pregnancy, which is given \u201cnew salience and \nmedicalisation through technological intervention and political debate\u201d. (Rapp \n2000:128). \n \nIn summary, Duden argues that the proliferation of the \u201cPublic Foetus\u201d has \nfacilitated the blurring of the boundary between the medical and the social \nthus facilitating the exclusion of a more individualistic and personal \nexperience of pregnancy. She has demonstrated how the biomedical image, \nwhen transported into the public arena, takes on the \u201caura\u201d of a portrait and it \nis from this point that the giant leap of faith from scientific fact to living being \ntakes place. The ultrasound image becomes a document of the foetus\u2019s status \nas a social being and not just a biological entity. The Foetus becomes an \nautonomous being, a rights bearing citizen. This has had an important effect \non the legal status of the foetus in that it has created a legal space for it to \n 14 \nspeak through the medium of adults representing its interests against those of \nthe pregnant woman.xv \n \nNormalisation of Pregnancy \nVery briefly above, I have attempted to summarise a number of \nconsequences, implicit and explicit, that arise from Duden\u2019s exposition of the \npublic foetus. However, the consequence that most interests Duden is the \nway in which the public foetus has lead to a normalisation of the medical \nmodel of pregnancy and the effect this has had on the meaning of pregnancy \nfor women. \n \nShe is concerned that the consequence of this proliferation of foetal images \nand the blurring of the boundaries between science and culture has been a \nstrengthened demand for the administrative control of pregnancy and the \nextension of legal protection of the foetus against the mother (Duden \n1993a:52). In the Western world, it is now commonplace from the time of \nconception, for the medical profession to take over the conduct of a \npregnancy and monitor the pregnant woman in a way that privileges the \nfoetus over the experience of the mother. Duden demonstrates this through a \ncase study of a pregnant woman in a Harlem clinic. The subject, \u201cMaria\u201d is \nshown graphs of the normal pregnancy and is told in terms of the risk factors \nwhere she is situated on the curve of the graph. Duden expresses horror at \nthis process and suggests that the use of graphs in antenatal care reduces \npregnancy to statistics and takes away the personal nature of each \npregnancy. She argues that the use of statistics based upon a set of fixed \n 15 \nterms such as age and background have the effect of normalising and selling \na typical pregnancy as each individual pregnancy is seen within a conceptual \nframework of norms. In order to understand what is being said to her in the \nclinic, the pregnant woman has to stretch her imagination to grasp \nabstractions that remove her from the intimate experience of the past, where \nher expression of her intimate sensory experiences led the discussion of the \npregnancy. Duden makes clear that she is not questioning the antenatal \nprocedures that she is observing from standpoint of their technical efficiency \nbut from their effect on the psyche of the pregnant woman (Duden \n1993a:581). She notes that the experts seek to convince the pregnant woman \nthat prenatal procedures are good. The implicit assumptions in this however \nare that pregnancy implies risk, demands supervision and imposes decisions. \nIt \u201crequires a large bureaucratic apparatus to encourage passage through the \nmaze\u201d (Duden 1993a:582) The woman\u2019s body becomes a space for \ntechnocratic and bureaucratic intervention when the unborn child is discussed \nin terms of risk and probability and thus transformed from an individual foetus \ninto a morsel of population. Duden is concerned that this management of \npregnancy reduces innumerable intimate female experiences of pregnancy to \na quantum and accepts the cultural and political model of the foetus as a \ncitizen.  \n \nAs noted above, the use of ultrasound technology supports this medical \nmodel of pregnancy by the way in which the image is mediated through expert \nmedical discourses at a stage in the pregnancy where a woman could not \nprovide the kind of information that the doctors seem to be seeking, about for \n 16 \nexample the stage of development of the foetus. Duden fears that the \ntechnique of ultrasound has replaced dialogue between the doctor and the \npregnant woman and underpins the impression that doctors know more about \nthe pregnancy than the woman herself ever could. In this way, the pregnant \nwoman becomes habituated to being told how her pregnancy is progressing \nand accepts the \u201ctruth\u201d that the professionals know more about her future \nchild than she can herself (Duden 1993a:583).  \n \nDuden\u2019s conclusion is that new forms of perception, images, concepts and \nattitudes have been made possible by the development of ultrasound \ntechnology. The technique has changed the position of pregnant woman \nirrevocably, not only in medical terms but also their social, legal and cultural \nposition in society. However, she does not see this change as positive but as \nthe loss of an important space and source of power for women. \n \n\u201cCompared to historical women, a modern woman has no comparable power \nto define her social status by making a statement about her body. In our \nsociety we are accepted as sick, healthy or pregnant only when certified as \nsuch by a professional. Historically, woman had the power to testify to an \nexperience which was not just private but ultimately not shareable.\u201d (Duden \n1993a:94) \n \nShe notes ironically that while the interior of women\u2019s bodies has become \npublic, medically, administratively and judicially, the exterior of the female \nbody remains privatised, ideologically and culturally. \n 17 \nRevisiting the \u201cPublic Foetus\u201d \n\u201cPregnancies, when they occur, occur in women\u2019s\u2019 bodies. For those who \nchampion \u201cchoice\u201d to lose sight of this simple and obvious, yet profoundly \nradical fact in a post 1980s struggle for reproductive freedom would be finally \nto surrender the possibility of freedom\u201d (Hartouni 1997:288) \n \nDuden\u2019s final comments on the changing social construction of women \nsuggest firstly that she subscribes to the somewhat monolithic radical feminist \ntheories which argue that the new reproduction technologies are an attempt \nby the male dominated fields of science and technology to appropriate the \nreproductive capacities that have been women\u2019s unique source of power \n(Stanworth 1987; Sawicki 1991). Further, although this is at no time made \nexplicit in her work, it would seem that she subscribes to the essentialist \nfeminist theories that argue that the production of knowledge through \nvisualisation and objectification is specifically masculine (Fuss 1989, Stacey \n1993).  \n \nWhilst I would agree that the history of science and medicine has been male \ndominated in Western Society and that this has inevitable effects upon the \ntreatment of the female subjects of these powerful biomedical discourses, I \nam troubled by Duden\u2019s conclusions which seem to suggest that there is little \nwomen can do to resist this power or reclaim their bodies from the oppressive \n(male) gaze.  \n \n 18 \nI have noted earlier, the influence on Duden\u2019s work of Foucauldian theories of \nthe production of power through the creation of privileged discourses of \nknowledge. Whilst Foucault provides a very useful method for exposing the \nthreads of power exercised through these discourses, one criticism that has \nbeen made of his early work is that his critique leaves existing gender \ndivisions intact (McNeil 1993; Sawicki 1991). In other words, the use of his \nwork may make us aware of the patterns of power that exist in society but he \ndoes not provide the tools for shifting those patterns or resisting them. My \nown response to Duden\u2019s essay echoes this criticism. Her argument is very \npowerful and in many ways persuasive but I would resist her conclusion that \nwomen are powerless to resist or engage with the discourses that attempt to \nshape their experience of pregnancy. In many ways, appealing to a pre-\nmodern era is unhelpful to the majority of women facing decisions about \nchildbirth in the UK today.  \n \nI do accept and agree that the technologies for managing pregnancy are often \nembedded in a medical frame of reference that defines women as patients \nand pregnancy as illness. To discuss pregnancy in this way, inevitably results \nin the de-emphasis of the social and emotional dimensions of the experience. \nUndoubtedly, many women are left with the sense of being onlookers in the \nprocess of giving birth. However, Duden\u2019s approach tends to suggest that \nanything less than a natural process of pregnancy and childbirth represents \nthe degradation of motherhood itself. The danger in this argument is that the \nmotherhood that is being taken from women through the new visual \ntechnologies becomes something that is biologically determined and \n 19 \nsomething to which all women are assumed to have the same relationship \n(Stanworth 1987). In taking this approach, Duden risks inflating the \nimportance of scientific and medical practice in 20th century pregnancy to \npregnancy\u2019s defining factor and by so doing she produces a mirror image of \nthe concept of pregnancy that is being produced by the medical practitioners \nthemselves. I would argue that social shaping is not the same as \ndetermination. The fact that Duden has identified a system of sanctions and\/or \nrewards existing within the social and medical framework to encourage \nwomen to co-operate with medical antenatal care indicates that conformity is \nnot guaranteed and that resistance is a genuine option that efforts are made \nto curtail (Stanworth 1987:17; Rapp 2000; Saetnan 2000). \n \nIndeed, at the time that Duden was writing, multiple possible sites of \nresistance to the dominant discourses of reproductive politics were already \nbeing explored (Sawicki 1991:70). One such method, discussed by Jana \nSawicki, is to utilise the possibilities of resistance recognised in Foucault\u2019s \nlater work (for example The History of Sexuality 1978) and develop it from a \nfeminist perspective. Sawicki suggests that although reproductive \ntechnologies are largely controlled by non-feminist forces, these forces are \nnot unified and it can also be assumed that women and feminists have played \na role in defining past and current practices. She argues that we should not \nfocus solely on the dominant discourses of the medical profession but also on \nthe \u201cmoments of resistance\u201d from individuals (men and women) and organised \ninterest groups representing scientists, economists and women that have \nresulted in the transformation of the practices surrounding childbirth over the \n 20 \nyears (Sawicki 1991:80). She does not seek to contradict the suggestion by \nDuden and that medicine has had a monopoly over reproduction during this \ncentury but rather asks us to consider that this control is not simply imposed \nfrom the top but has had to be won and continually faces resistancexvi. \n \nDuden\u2019s standpoint approach is both impassioned and convincing. However, \nthe question that she fails to ask is how can feminists devise strategies to \nengage in the struggle over who defines women\u2019s needs and how they are \nsatisfied. She operates within a binary model of alternatives (technology \nversus natural) that has a tendency to portray the power of the (patriarchal) \nmedical profession in monolithic terms. This situates all pregnant women as \nvictims and passive subjects. She seems to assume that women have to \nsuccumb and fails to take some women\u2019s desire for such technologies \nseriously (see Mitchell et al 2000; Farquar 2000).  \n \nFurther, Duden\u2019s account of the biomedical and political discourses \nsurrounding ultrasound technology fails to recognise that pregnant women \nmay talk about, use and perceive the image projected by the ultrasound in a \ndifferent way to the male (or female) doctors, scientists or politicians that she \nseeks to expose and that this female personal engagement with the \ntechnology may be equally valid. Duden\u2019s portrayal of her post modern \nwomen in the shape of \u201cJoanne\u201d and \u201cMaria\u201d seems disturbingly passive and \naccepting of their fate. I would question whether this is really the case. There \nis no doubt that some women derive pleasure and comfort from the chance to \nsee their baby (Petchesky 1987; Taylor 1998, Rapp 2000). Duden\u2019s account \n 21 \nof \u201cJoanne\u201d passing around her ultrasound \u201cpicture\u201d would seem to accept this \npossibility. However, Duden neatly side steps the issue of the validity of \nJoanne\u2019s pleasure at the image and submerges it within her wider discussion \nof the implication of seeing a life in the image. As Franklin, Lury and Stacey \nhave suggested \u201cexperiences and interpretations of images are never \nsingular, discrete events but are informed by a broader set of conditions and \nfactors\u201d (Franklin et al:297). Women are not na\u00efve nor are they passive and \nthere is evidence to suggest that they are sufficiently visually sophisticated to \ngo beyond what Duden terms \u201cvision on command\u201d and appropriate the \nartefacts constructed by bio-medical culture to construct their \u201cown cultural \nnarratives inflected with other aspects of their worlds\u201dxvii.  \n \nIn absenting the above issue from her discussion, Duden avoids having to \naddress difficult questions about how or even whether women ought to use \nreproductive technologies. Such questions can\u2019t be answered from the \nstandpoint of the common historical reproductive consciousness that Duden \nseeks to persuade the reader was the birthright of the historical pregnant \nwoman. While I would agree with her that the historical experience of \npregnancy cannot be regained, I would ask whether we should really wish to \nturn back the clock in this way. \n \nDuden suggests that the only way for women to regain a \u201ctrue\u201d haptic \nexperience of pregnancy would be to resist the use of the new technologies, \nalthough in the same breath she acknowledges that in our twentieth century \nvisually sophisticated society, this is not possible.xviii I do not agree that the \n 22 \nfact that women cannot revert to the social and cultural experience of \npregnancy of her 18th Century counterpart is necessarily a bad thing or that it \nmeans that women cannot have a holistic experience of pregnancy. In 2001, \nthe Guardian Weekend magazine ran a two-part article on one woman\u2019s \nexperience of a wanted pregnancy (Enright 2001). Although to some extent, \nAnne Enright\u2019s account of her pregnancy provides support for Duden\u2019s \nargument that the visual image produced by the ultrasound causes women to \nsee their pregnancy in a different way, the overwhelming impression gained \nfrom the article is the embodied way in which women experience pregnancy \non a personal level. Of course, this does not necessarily detract from what \nDuden is saying about the impact of the foetal image on a public level or from \nthe effect it may have on women who wish to have an abortion but it does \nsuggest that twentieth century pregnant women are able to detach their own \npregnancies from the type of political and cultural discourses associated with \nthe public image of the foetus and experience them in a holistic way, \ncombining the visual image in a positive way with the more sensual embodied \naspects of the experience. \n \nPetchesky has supported this view that women are able to distinguish \nbetween the private and public images of the foetus and she explores the way \nin which women have been able to subvert the gaze and actively participate in \ntheir pregnancies through this distinction (Petchesky 1987; Shohat 1992). \nContrary to the view posited by Duden, she notes that women have not just \nbeen victims of reproductive technologies but that they have in many cases \ngenerated the demands for some of the technologies now available, such as \n 23 \nthe contraceptive pill and infertility treatments (Petchesky 1987:72). Further, \nthey can challenge the norms established by the medical profession by \nrefusing to accept ultrasound, sharing their experiences and exposing \ninadequacies in the model of treatment. Finally, Petchesky seeks to introduce \nthe concept of social and biological differences such as class, race, sexual \npreference, age and fertility history to undermine the predominant feminist \ndiscourse of a collective reproductive consciousness and construct a \npersuasive argument that \u201ctechniques for imaging foetuses and pregnancies \nmay, depending on their cultural contexts and uses, offer means for \nempowering women, both individually and collectively.\u201d (Petchesky 1987:78).  \n \nThis analysis is supported by the work of feminist anthropologists such as \nRapp, Mitchell and Saetnan. Their work has uncovered the diverse \nrelationships that women occupy in relation to these technologies. Rapp \nargues it is important to focus on the pregnant woman in relation to all of \nthese social relationships, not just her relationship to medical professionals. \nHer observations were that the group best served by advances in \nreproductive medicine \u2013 white middle class women \u2013 were also the most \nvulnerable to its powerful definitions of motherhood (Rapp 2000). This finding \nis echoed by anthropological studies of the use of ultrasound in Canada and \nGreece, which found that the use and understanding of ultrasound images \nshapes and is shaped by both local and global discourses (Mitchell et al \n2000).  \n \n 24 \nBy directing our attention to the differences among women and to the \nintersecting social relations in which women are situated, we are more likely \nto locate what Foucault refers to as \u201csubjugated knowledges\u201d \u2013 that is forms \nof experience and knowledge that have not previously been articulated, \nnamely the discourses of women as to how they are affected by new \nreproductive technologies, the material condition of their lives, their own \ndescription of their needs and of pregnancy.  \n \nWhilst I agree with Spivak (1998), Irigaray and Fuss (1989) that essentialism \ncan have a powerful place in feminist writing as part of an important dialogue \nof resistance for displacing and disrupting dominant masculine discourses, the \nrisk in such a strategy is that it oversimplifies the variety of women\u2019s \nexperiences of pregnancy. Narratives such as Duden\u2019s are \u201cinvested in \nreaffirming traditional ideas of what women essentially are rather than \ncontesting them or encouraging the construction of new ones\u201d (Farquar 2000: \n212). The possible consequences for women of the new reproductive \ntechnologies have been powerfully exposed by essays such as Duden\u2019s but \nnow the difference approach taken by authors such as Petchesky, Rapp and \nSaetnan of speaking to rather than about women, provides a practical means \nof engagement in rather than alienation from the current debates (see also \nSpivak 1988). \n \nIn contrast to Duden, I would suggest that rather than finding ways to opt out \nof post-modern society, women should seek to engage in a way that is \nmeaningful to them in the society in which they live. In the late twentieth \n 25 \ncentury, that inevitably involves new technology. As Petchesky has \ncommented \u201cto reduce technology to a weapon in a male war against the \nwomb is to submerge women\u2019s own responses to pregnancy in male fantasies \nof power and succumb to technological determinism\u201d (Petchesky 1987:71). \n \nNaturally, women may be wary of new medical innovations in reproductive \ntechnology due to their knowledge and experience of the ambivalent effects of \nmedical technologies on their lives in the past. It is for precisely this reason \nthat the assessment of the risks and benefits of any technology that affects \nwomen so directly can\u2019t be left to the (male) experts. Women have to engage \nwith science and ask does it work, does it deliver what it promises, what are \nthe risks. As Stanworth has explained, risk not purely a technical matter, it \nalso contains a social dimension; what is acceptable to the patient (Stanworth \n1987:33). As Haraway has argued generally, if women seek to engage with \ntechno science, it may be that they will have some effect on ensuring that \ncriteria used for assessing new technologies incorporate women\u2019s own \npriorities (Haraway 1997). \n \nDonna Haraway\u2019s difficult but innovative work has suggested a further way in \nwhich women can resist dominant male discourses, namely by creating their \nown discourses, by appropriating for themselves the images that have worked \nagainst them. From the mid 1980s some feminist critics have sought to \nsubvert the public foetus in this way by drawing on Haraway\u2019s work and \nconceptualising the foetal image as a cyborg (see also Kirkup et al 2000; \nBidduck 1993:168).  \n 26 \nAlternatively, rather than appropriating problematic and disembodied images \nof the foetus, other feminists have sought to challenge such visual images by \ncreating new subjective and embodied images of pregnancy. One example is \nAnnie Liebovitz\u2019s photograph of a naked and heavily pregnant Demi Moore, \nwhich appeared on the cover of Vanity Fair in August 1991. At the time, the \nimage provoked outrage and appeared in newsstands in America covered in \nbrown paper wrappers. However, it may be significant that since this image \nappeared, there has been an emergence of alternative images of pregnant \nwomen within British popular culture (Tyler 1996:300). Although I fully accept \nthat this type of glamour photography of pregnant celebrities is not \nunproblematic for women seeking to break the constraints of patriarchal \nideology, it may present a context that would allow women to resist the \ndisembodied foetal images of pregnancy and re-establish different discourses \nof pregnancy as an embodied female experience.  \n \nIn summary, the project that I would wish feminist writers to undertake is to \nconsider the question of whether it is possible to create the political and \ncultural conditions in which the new reproductive technologies can be \nemployed by women to shape the experience of pregnancy according to their \nown definitions. Two ways in which this project could be undertaken, (as \nsuggested by Petchesky, Sawicki, Haraway and others and discussed briefly \nabove), would be through the production of new discourses and new images \nof pregnancy and the re-contextualising and re-embodying of the foetus so \nthat the woman is no longer seen as secondary to her foetus, simply its eco-\nsystem. Once the resources with which to reframe pregnant embodiment and \n 27 \nsubjectivity have been imagined and created then it may be possible to \n\u201cestablish woman centred territory at the centre of reproductive politics\u201d \n(Franklin 1991:204). In response to changes in what matters and what is \nsignificant, women\u2019s reproductive freedom must be established over and over \nagain. We cannot reject the dominant definitions of the \u201cPublic Foetus\u201d so \nvividly portrayed by Duden but that does not mean that we have to accept \nthem. \n \n \nAcknowledgements: \nThe following people have given valuable help in the research and revision of \nthis paper: Bela Chatterjee, Hazel Biggs and the anonymous referee. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 28 \n                                                 \ni Duden uses the powerful metaphor of the horizon throughout her book to represent the boundaries of \nthe visible and the possible. \n \nii Duden\u2019s essay starts with the religious backdrop to the abortion debate in Germany and at points \nthroughout the essay she draws upon religious discourses that surround the issues of reproductive \ncontrol. Whilst I accept the power of religious discourses to effect a change in society, it does not seem \nto me that the influence of religion in the UK has the same hold as it does in Germany and the USA \nand so for this and other reasons, I have not discussed this aspect of Duden\u2019s essay in any depth. \n \niii A number of feminist writers in this area have discussed the objectification of woman through \nmedical intervention in pregnancy and how this takes away from women\u2019s felt experience. See Taylor \n(1998) page 27 and Oakley (1987) page 37. However, Duden uses the term \u201cfelt experience\u201d in a very \nspecific and historically grounded way. \n \niv Quickening was the term used historically to indicate the point at which pregnancy moved from a \ntentative maybe to definite sign. This term has historical legal resonance as Sarah Franklin has \ndiscussed in her article in relation to the point at which abortion was no longer possible. See Franklin \n(1991): Fetal Fascinations: new dimensions of medical scientific personhood in Franklin, Lury and \nStacey (eds): Off Centre: Feminist and Cultural Studies, London, Harper & Collins at page 198 \n \nv There is a certain irony in the way in which ultrasound has come to be seen as a window on the body \nin that it is primarily a technology based upon sound waves rather than vision. It has been suggested \nthat the reason the technology is set up in such a way as to translate sound waves into a visual images is \nthe preference in modern culture for a visual image. See Franklin, Lury and Stacey (2000) at p. 300 \n \nvi Throughout her book, Duden uses the term \u201cunborn\u201d to denote the embryo or foetus embodied within \nthe mother. She uses this to distance and contrast the pregnant woman with the public foetus. \n \nvii For a different consideration of pregnancy as a tentative condition in relation to the issue of the \nreassurance about lack of abnormality provided by ultrasound imaging see Janelle Taylor (1998): \nImage of Contradiction: Obstetrical Ultrasound in American Culture, in Sarah Franklin and Helena \nRagone, Reproducing Reproduction, University of Pennsylvania Press pp. 15-45. \n \nviii For an account of the commodification of the modern foetus see Janelle Taylor (1998) \n \nix Saetnan\u2019s study seemed to suggest that for those women who were going through their first \npregnancy and had not yet experienced the baby move, the ultrasound did seem to carry more authority \nthan other clinical tests and experienced pregnancy symptoms. It made the pregnancy seem more real \nto them (Saetnan 200:339). However, for other women who had felt \u201cquickening\u201d, the sensations of \ntheir own bodies took precedence over the ultrasound images. Saetnan\u2019s conclusion was that the visual \nimages did not push aside the signals that women felt from within their own bodies and that generally, \nthe images functioned as a supplement to rather than a replacement of the women\u2019s embodied \nexperiences of pregnancy (Saetnan 2000:340). However, Saetnan did note that in order for women to \nmake the translation from the images on the screen to their bodily sensations, they had to some degree \nto \u201csubordinate themselves to medical authority\u201d in as far as most of the women relied on the \nmidwife\u2019s interpretation of the images rather than what they themselves could see. Nevertheless, \nSaetnan concludes that most of the women were able to maintain to some extent, an interpretation of \nthe scan as an opportunity to see the baby even as they recognised that the medical role of the \nultrasound was for diagnostic purposes (Saetnan 2000:341). \n \n \nx None of the women in the survey had received a negative diagnosis (in the sense that there were \nproblems with the foetus) and Saetnan considers that if this had been the case, it may have been more \ndifficult to resist a medical construction of the pregnancy (Saetnan 2000:351) \n \nxi  Petchesky (1987) ibid note 19 mentions a different magazine a few years earlier in her article. Karen \nNewman (1996) ibid note 4 suggests that foetal images have been around far longer but makes \n 29 \n                                                                                                                                            \nreference to medical textbooks and I think she misses the point in that many of the drawings represent \nhomunculi rather than true foetal images. Further, medical diagrams and representations were not \nwidely available for utilisation in cultural and social discourse in the sense that images of the foetus are \nin the twentieth century. Duden makes clear in her article that she is distinguishing between \ndiagrammatic representation and facsimile. \n \nxii That is assuming that the woman is allowed to enter into a dialogue with the medical expert. Taylor \n(1998) has noted that since gynaecologists have been able to determine due dates from ultrasound \nimages, in many instances woman are no longer even asked for the date of their last period as it is \nassumed that the information gleaned from the image will be more truthful and accurate than the \nwoman\u2019s own testimony. \n \nxiii The reason that I have inserted hopefully here is that a number of writers including Duden (1993) \nand Taylor (1998) have noted that the claim that abnormalities can be discovered earlier through the \nuse of ultrasound technology doesn\u2019t seem to be borne out in practice. There have been many mistakes \nmade in diagnosis and consequently the medical use of the ultrasound in antenatal care for this purpose \nhas come under some scrutiny. \n \nxiv The statistics used by Duden (1993) suggested that a high percentage of women were exposed to \nultrasound but by no means all. Janelle Taylor\u2019s more recent article (1998) would seem to suggest that \nalmost all women now experience at least one ultrasound during pregnancy and that if they do not for \nsome reason, they are now inclined to demand one. \n \nxv An extreme example of foetal rights displacing those of its mother can be seen in a number of \ndisturbing cases of women being kept on life support machines, in some case against their express \nwishes until the child can be born by caesarean. For an account of the legal position of the foetus and \nembryo see Alison Young (1993) Decapitation of Feticide: The Fetal Laws of the Universal Subject in \nWomen: A Cultural Review 4, pp. 288-294, Petchesky (1987) and Julie Wallbank (1999): Throwing \nBaby out with the Bathwater: Some Reflections on Developments in Reproductive Technologies in Res \nPublica and (2000) Transforming the Monstrous into the Sacred (draft copy borrowed from author).  \n \nxvi Ultrasound technology clearly fits within the Foucauldian model of disciplinary power. It involves \nsophisticated techniques of surveillance and examination that make foetuses visible in ways that \nfacilitate the creation of new objects and subjects of medical as well as legal and state intervention. \nHowever, authors such as Farquar (2000) and Sawicki (1991) remind us that such power is diffuse, \nmultifaceted and can operate both positively and negatively, enabling as well as controlling. As such, \nJawicki\u2019s interpretation of a Foucauldian understanding of power as \u201ca myriad of shifting relations\u201d \ndoes not undermine Duden\u2019s analysis, rather it situates her appeal to a more holistic, maternal \nexperience of pregnancy as only one of several strategies than can be employed to resist the \nmedicalisation of pregnancy and women\u2019s bodies.  \n \nxvii A number of articles in the Guardian (for example Tues, Dec 28 1999 and 4 April 1999. There was \nalso a more recent article in 2001) described how a group of artists have written graffiti over \nadvertisements in such as way as to totally change the meaning of the advertisement from that \nintended. I would argue that in the current visual society, we are constantly engaging with and re-\nnegotiating images in this way putting them within our own contexts.  \n \nxvii In this suggestion, Duden echoes concerns raised by FINRRAGE (Feminist International Network \nof Resistance to Reproductive and Genetic Engineering). This group argued in opposition to earlier \nliberal views of reproductive technologies, such as that of Shulamith Firestone who advocated their use \nto \u201cfree women from the tyranny of reproduction\u201d (1970). The group of radical feminists who formed \nthis association in 1984 saw motherhood as the foundation of women\u2019s identity and saw reproductive \ntechnologies as an extension of patriarchal control and the exploitation of women\u2019s\u2019 bodies (see Corea \n1985). They believed that the new reproductive technologies offered a powerful means of social control \nbecause they would become standard practice as indeed the ultrasound examination is today. \nFINRRAGE saw reproductive technologies as linked to genetic engineering- for them, the female body \nwas being expropriated as a \u201cliving laboratory\u201d (Mahjouri 2004). To some extent, their arguments were \n 30 \n                                                                                                                                            \nprescient in that techniques such as IVF now provide researchers with the embryo material on which to \ndo stem cell research.
