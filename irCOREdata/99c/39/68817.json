Both strains showed similar colonization\nability either on root surfaces or in wounded stems.\nThe results suggest that bacterial ACC deaminase of\nP. brassicacearum Am3 can promote growth in tomato\nby masking the phytopathogenic properties of this\nbacterium.\nKey words: ACC deaminase, colonization, ethylene, GFP,\nPGPR, phytopathogen, plant\u2013bacteria interactions,\nPseudomonas, rhizosphere, tomato.\nIntroduction\nA number of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria\n(PGPR), belonging to various taxonomic groups including\nPseudomonas, contain the enzyme 1-aminocyclopropane-\n1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase, which hydrolyses ACC,\nthe immediate precursor of the plant hormone ethylene\n(Honma and Shimomura, 1978; Glick et al., 1995;\nBelimov et al., 2001, 2005). These bacteria, occurring\non the root surface, degrade ACC to ammonium and\na-ketobutyrate for use as carbon and nitrogen sources.\nSince a dynamic equilibrium of ACC concentration exists\nbetween root, rhizosphere, and bacterium, bacterial uptake\nof rhizospheric ACC stimulates plant ACC efflux,\n* To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Stimulation of\nroot elongation and biomass production of different plant\nspecies by inoculations with PGPR having ACC de-\naminase activity has been repeatedly documented, partic-\nularly when the plants were subjected to stressful growth\nconditions (Hall et al., 1996; Glick et al., 1997; Burd\net al., 1998; Belimov et al., 2001, 2005; Van Loon and\nGlick, 2004; Safronova et al., 2006).\nPseudomonas brassicacearum has been described as a\ntypical bacterium inhabiting the rhizoplane of Arabidopsis\nthaliana and Brassica napus, and phenotypically related\nto the phytopathogen Pseudomonas corrugata (Achouak\net al., 2000). Contradictory data about the nature of the\ninteraction between P. brassicacearum and plants have\nbeen reported. The strain P. brassicacearum 520-1 was\ndescribed as a pathogen for tomato, causing chlorosis,\nbrowning, and necrotic lesions when plant wounds were\ninfected (Sikorski et al., 2001). Endophytic strains of\nP. brassicacearum have been isolated from potato stem\ntissue infected with Erwinia carotovora (Reiter et al.,\n2003), but pathogenicity or plant growth-promoting\nactivity of these isolates was not reported. On the other\nhand, several P. brassicacearum strains exhibited take-all\ndisease suppression in wheat infected with Gaeumanno-\nmyces graminis and were suggested as potential bio-\ncontrol agents (Ross et al., 2000). Furthermore,\nP. brassicacearum strain Am3, which has ACC deami-\nnase activity, promoted root elongation of Indian mustard\n(Brassica juncea) in vitro and increased root and shoot\nbiomass of rape (B. napus) and pea (Pisum sativum) in pot\ntrials (Belimov et al., 2001; Safronova et al., 2006).\nHowever, the presence of ACC deaminase in other\nP. brassicacearum strains and its effect on plant root devel-\nopment has not been studied.\nThe objective of the current work was to determine the\neffects of different P. brassicacearum strains on tomato,\na species for which P. brassicacearum was reported to be\nphytopathogenic (Sikorski et al., 2001). The role of ACC\ndeaminase in plant\u2013bacteria interactions was examined by\nmeasuring in vitro ACC deaminase activity of the strains\nstudied, and by creating a mutant of P. brassicacearum\nstrain Am3 with decreased ACC deaminase activity.\nMaterials and methods\nCharacteristics of the bacterial strains\nA list and description of strains used is given in Table 1. PGPR\nstrains P. brassicacearum Am3, Pseudomonas sp. Dp2 (Belimov\net al., 2001), and Variovorax paradoxus 5C-2 (Belimov et al., 2005)\ncontaining ACC deaminase, and Escherichia coli strain S17-\n1::pSUP5011 (Simon et al., 1983) were obtained from the\nARRIAM Collection (St-Petersburg). Phytopathogenic strains P.\nbrassicacearum 520-1 (Sikorski et al., 2001) and P. corrugata 176\n(Bykova et al., 1991) were kindly provided by Dr W Wackernagel\n(University of Oldenburg, Germany) and Dr AM Lazarev\n(All-Russia Research Institute of Plant Protection, St-Petersburg),\nrespectively. Strain Escherichia coli S17-1::pAG408 (Suarez et al.,\n1997) was kindly provided by Dr T Charles (University of\nWaterloo, Canada).\nAn ACC deaminase-deficient mutant of P. brassicacearum Am3\nwas obtained using Tn5 mutagenesis via conjugation with E. coli\nS17-1::pSUP5011. For this purpose, 0.1 ml aliquots of cell\nsuspensions (109 cells ml\u00011) of strain S17-1::pSUP5011 grown on\nLB agar, supplemented with 50 lg ml\u00011 kanamycin, and strain\nAm3 grown on DF agar (Belimov et al., 2001), supplemented with\n0.3 mg ml\u00011 ACC as a nitrogen source (DFA medium), were\nspotted on LB agar plate and incubated overnight at 28 \u0001C. Then\nbacteria were resuspended in sterile water, plated on DF agar\nsupplemented with 50 lg ml\u00011 kanamycin and 0.3 mg ml\u00011\n(NH4)2SO4 as a nitrogen source (DFN medium), and incubated for\n24 h at 22 \u0001C. Under these growth conditions recipient strain Am3\nformed colonies characteristic of fluorescent pseudomonads,\nwhereas growth of the donor E. coli strain was delayed by low\ntemperature. The frequency of Kmr clones of Am3 (calculated as\na ratio of the recombinant titre to the recipient) was 10\u00016, whereas\nthe frequency of Am3 spontaneous Kmr mutants was lower than\n10\u00019. Three hundred Kmr transconjugant clones were picked up on\nreplica plates containing DFA (selection medium) and DFN (control\nmedium) agar, incubated for 48 h at 28 \u0001C, and the transconjugant\nT8-1 that lacked ability to grow on DFA medium was selected. The\n16S rDNA gene of T8-1 was partially sequenced as described\nearlier (Belimov et al., 2005) and the sequence obtained (accession\nnumber AY916776) showed 99.8% homology with wild-type Am3,\nconfirming that the isolated mutant T8-1 is a derivative of this\nstrain. To ascertain whether Tn5-mob had been inserted into the\nisolate T8-1, PCR was performed to amplify the nptII gene (Chuang\net al., 1999) using oligonucleotides CTCGACGTTGTCACT-\nGAAGCGGGAAG (TNF) and AAAGCACGAGGAAGCGGT-\nCAGCCCAT (TNR). Isolate T8-1 produced a short DNA fragment\nof 500 bp, indicating the presence of the Tn5-mob insert in the\nmutants, whereas the parental strain Am3, which does not harbour\nthe nptII gene, showed no result (data not shown).\nTo monitor tomato root and tissue colonization by bacteria, the\nstrains Am3 and T81 were marked with the gene encoding green\nfluorescent protein (GFP) of the jellyfish Aequorea victoria. For this\npurpose, the spontaneous mutants Am3R and T8-1R resistant to\n20 lg ml\u00011 rifampicin were obtained via incubation of bacteria on\nBacto-Pseudomonas F (BPF) agar containing (g l\u00011): peptone, 10;\ncasein hydrolysate, 10; glycerol, 12.5; K2HPO4, 1.5; MgSO4, 1.5;\nagar, 15. Strains Am3R and T8-1R were conjugated with E. coli\nS17-1 carrying the promoter-probe gfp-based mini-transposon\nsuicide delivery system pAG408 with kanamycin (30 lg ml\u00011) and\ngentamycin (15 lg ml\u00011) resistance as described by Suarez et al.\n(1997). Transconjugants named Am3RF and T8-1RF, having\nhigh and visible fluorescence intensity under UV light suggesting\nchromosomal integration downstream of strong promoters of\nthe mini-transposon, were finally selected and used for further\nexperiments.\nUtilization of ACC\nThe ACC deaminase activity of the bacteria was determined by\nmonitoring the amount of a-ketobutyrate (aKB) generated by\nenzymatic hydrolysis of ACC in cell-free extracts as described\npreviously (Belimov et al., 2005).\n1486 Belimov et al.\n at Lancaster University on 16 December 2009 http:\/\/jxb.oxfordjournals.orgDownloaded from \nIn batch culture, strains P. brassicacearum Am3 and T8-1 were\nincubated for 22 d at 25 \u0001C without shaking in flasks containing\n50 ml of liquid SMY (Belimov et al., 2005) medium (l\u00011): glucose,\n1.2 g; KH2PO4, 0.4 g; K2HPO4, 2 g; MgSO4, 0.2 g; CaCl2, 0.1 g;\nFeSO4, 5 mg; H3BO3, 2 mg; ZnSO4, 5 mg; Na2MoO4, 1 mg;\nMnSO4, 3 mg; CoSO4, 1 mg; CuSO4, 1 mg; NiSO4, 1 mg; yeast\nextract, 50 mg; pH 6.4. The SMY medium was supplemented with\n10 mM ACC or 5 mM (NH4)2SO4 such that the amounts of N were\nequal. Initial bacterial concentration in SMY medium was 105 cells\nml\u00011. Bacterial growth was determined daily by monitoring the\noptical density (OD) at 540 nm. The inoculated SMY medium\nwithout supplements was used as a blank to each strain.\nRoot elongation assay\nThe plant root elongation-promoting activity of the bacteria was\ndetermined using the modified root elongation assay of Belimov\net al. (2001). Bacteria were grown for 48 h at 28 \u0001C on BPF agar\nsupplemented with antibiotics where necessary. Cells were collected\nand resuspended to 106, 107, and 108 cells ml\u00011 in sterile nutrient\nsolution (lM): 500, MgSO4; 500, K2HPO4; 200, KH2PO4; 500,\nCaCl2; 20, KNO3; 5, NaFeEDTA; 0.1, MnSO4; 0.1, ZnSO4; 0.1,\nH3BO3; 0.01, CoCl2; 0.01, CuSO4; 0.01, Na2MoO4; 0.01, NiCl2;\n0.01, KJ. Five millilitres of the bacterial suspensions or sterile\nnutrient solution (uninoculated control) were added to filter paper\n(Whatman #1) in Petri dishes (diameter 90 mm). For treatments\nwith chemical inhibitors of ethylene biosynthesis or action, the\nnutrient solution was supplemented with 0.1 lM aminoethoxyvinyl-\nglycine (AVG), 1 lM Ag2SO4, or 2 lM CoCl2 (final concentra-\ntion). Tomato [Lycopersicon esculentum (\u00bcSolanum lycopersicum)\nMill. cv. Ailsa Craig] seeds were surface-sterilized with 5% sodium\nhypochlorite solution for 15 min, washed carefully with sterile water\nand placed on wetted filter paper. The treated seeds were tested for\nsurface sterility in a set of preliminary experiments via incubation\non BPF agar for 5 d at 28 \u0001C. After incubation of closed Petri dishes\nfor 8 d at 25 \u0001C in the dark, root length of seedlings was measured\nand root samples were taken for enumeration of bacteria and for\nmicroscopy as described below. The assay was repeated at least\ntwice with four dishes (15 seeds per dish) for each treatment.\nAgar culture\nTomato cv. Ailsa Craig root colonization by the GFP-tagged\ntransconjugants P. brassicacearum Am3RF and T8-1RF was\nassayed using agar culture. Surface-sterilized seeds were germinated\non filter paper wetted with bacterial suspensions (107 cells ml\u00011) for\n3 d as described above. Then germinated seeds having a root length\nof about 5 mm were transferred to Petri dishes (diameter 150 mm)\ncontaining 100 ml of the sterile nutrient solution (see above)\nsolidified with 0.7% agarose. Four seeds per each Petri dish (three\ndishes for each treatment) were placed 2 cm from each other in\na line located 3.5 cm from the box edge. The Petri dishes were\ninstalled at 45\u0001 to the horizontal to allow the roots to grow under\nthe agarose layer and were incubated for 10 d in a greenhouse with\na day\/night cycle of 16 h\/8 h at 25\/16 \u0001C and a photon flux density\nof 400 lmol quanta m\u00012 s\u00011. After incubation, colonization of roots\nby the bacteria was monitored microscopically and root samples\nwere taken for enumeration of bacteria as described below.\nPot experiments\nThese were carried out in the ARRIAM greenhouse (St-Petersburg)\nunder natural illumination and temperature in June\u2013August 2005\n(experiments 1 and 2) and in July 2006 (experiment 3). Surface-\nsterilized tomato seeds were transferred to enamel pots containing\n4 kg of unsterilized peat:sod-podzolic soil:dolomite (4:5:0.1, v\/v\/v)\nmixture having the following characteristics (mg kg\u00011): total C,\n58 000; total N, 6550; available P, 130; available K, 380; pHKCl,\n6.5. The mixture was fertilized with (mg kg\u00011): Ca(NO3)2, 250;\nKH2PO4, 125; KCl, 65; MgSO4, 50; ZnSO4, 1.5; MnSO4, 1.5;\nH3BO3, 5. In the course of the experiments the pots were watered\ndaily to maintain 70% of the water holding capacity.\nIn experiment 1 with cv. Ailsa Craig, the soil mixture was\nirrigated up to 80% of water holding capacity with tap water, or\nwith bacterial suspensions of P. brassicacearum strains Am3RF,\nT8-1RF, and 520-1 (inoculation resulted in a final concentration of\n106 cells g\u00011 soil) before planting. Roots of seedlings grown in\ninoculated and uninoculated soil were sampled 15 d after planting\n(DAP) for determination of bacterial root colonization (three\nreplicas per determination with two to four seedlings each) and\nseven seedlings remained in each pot. Three seedlings per pot were\ntaken for a second determination of bacterial root colonization\n(three replicas per determination with four seedlings each) 30 DAP.\nThe remaining plants (16 plants per treatment) were harvested 38\nDAP and dried at 40 \u0001C until constant mass.\nIn experiments 2 (cv. Ailsa Craig) and 3 (cv. Ailsa Craig and cv.\nMoneymaker) plants grown in pots containing soil mixture irrigated\nTable 1.

In the same manner,\ninjections with strains Dp2, 5C-2, and 176 were performed in\nexperiment 3 only. Control plants were injected with sterile 0.85%\nNaCl solution. A syringe needle of 0.5 mm diameter was passed\ncompletely through the stem between the cotyledons and the first\nleaf and bacterial suspension injected into the stem as the needle\nwas withdrawn. Plant shoots were harvested 26 d (six plants per\ntreatment) and 54 d (nine plants per treatment) (experiment 2) or\n37 d (eight plants per treatment) (experiment 3) after injection,\nweighed, and inspected for internal infection symptoms in the\nstems. Stem samples of uninfected control plants, and wound-\ninfected plants having discoloration and necrotic lesions were\naseptically taken with a sterile surgical blade for bacterial\nenumeration. Stem cross-sections were photographed using a digital\ncamera (model EOS10D, Canon, Japan).\nTomato fruit infection bioassay\nUnripe (green) tomato fruits of cv. Urozhainy having no visual\ndisease symptoms or disorders were collected at the ARRIAM\nexperimental field in August 2006. Fruits were surface-sterilized\nwith 1% sodium hypochlorite solution for 5 min and washed\ncarefully with sterile water. Then 10 ll of 0.85% NaCl solution\n(control) or bacterial suspensions of Am3, T8-1, 520-1, Dp2, 5C-2,\nand 176 (107 cells ml\u00011) were injected into the central pith area in\nsix fruits per treatment. After 10 d of incubation in the dark at room\ntemperature, fruit cross-sections were inspected and photographed\nas described above.\nEnumeration of bacteria associated with roots or\nlocalized in infected tissues\nRoot tips (10 mm) of all seedlings from each Petri dish of filter\npaper culture were cut, pooled, and washed by plunging into sterile\nwater 10 times to eliminate bacterial cells not attached to the roots.\nRoot segments located 3\u20137 cm from the seeds of each Petri dish of\nagar culture were carefully removed from the medium and\ncombined without any subsequent washing procedure. Roots from\nplants grown in soil were thoroughly shaken to remove adhering\nsoil particles. Stem tissues were used for analysis immediately after\nsampling. The plant samples were homogenized in sterile tap water\nwith a sterile mortar and pestle, the homogenates were serially\ndiluted in 10-fold steps, and 50 ll aliquots were plated in two\nreplicates on BPF agar supplemented with the required amounts of\nantibiotics where necessary (details in Tables 3, 4). In experiments\nwith filter paper and agar cultures, no antibiotics were added to\nestimate the total amount of bacteria, to examine stability of\ntransconjugants, and to check contamination of samples with\nextraneous microorganisms. To analyse the root samples taken from\nsoil, the medium was additionally supplemented with 40 lg ml\u00011\nnystatin to prevent growth of fungi. Colony-forming units (CFU)\nwere counted after incubation of plates for 4 d at 25 \u0001C. Presence of\nGFP marker in the isolated colonies was verified under UV light.\nMicroscopy\nThe presence and distribution of GFP-tagged bacteria on roots taken\nfrom filter paper and agar cultures was monitored using a laser scan-\nning confocal microscope (LEICA SP2A0BS; Leica, Germany). In\nfilter paper culture, root segments located 3 cm from the root tip\nwere visualized directly. In agar culture, root segments located 3\u20137\ncm from the seeds were carefully taken along with the agarose layer\nand immediately placed between microscope slides and cover slips.\nThree roots per treatment were scanned in each of two independent\nexperiments. Cross-sections of the infected tomato stem tissues (10\nplants per treatment) and the roots of plants grown in the inoculated\nsoil were examined using a light microscope Axiolab equipped with\nfilter set #01 (Carl Zeiss, Germany). Microphotographs of typical\ncolonization patterns of bacteria on roots and in the infected stem\ntissues were taken.\nStatistical analysis\nThe data were processed by variance and correlation analysis using\nthe software STATISTICA version 5.5 (StatSoft, Inc., USA). SE\nand LSD stand for standard error and Fisher\u2019s least significant\ndifference test, respectively.\nResults\nUtilization of ACC\nACC deaminase activity of the mutant P. brassicacearum\nT8-1 was 37 times less than that of the wild-type Am3\n(Table 1). During the first 15 d of incubation in batch\nculture, when ACC was the sole source of nitrogen, the\nT8-1 mutant also showed a low rate of ACC utilization\n(Fig. 1). Then the growth rate of T8-1 increased, probably\nas the selection pressure exerted by high ACC concen-\ntrations induced reverse mutations. The growth curves\nof T8-1 and Am3 in the presence of (NH4)2SO4 were\nidentical, suggesting that there were no significant meta-\nbolic losses in T8-1 caused by transformation.\nStrain P. brassicacearum 520-1 showed the highest\nACC deaminase activity of all the strains studied, with V.\nparadoxus 5C-2 the lowest (Table 2). Rifampicin-resistant\nmutants Am3R and T8-1R had an ACC deaminase activ-\nity similar to that of wild-type strains, whereas the activity\nof GFP-tagged derivatives of these strains decreased\nslightly, probably due to a metabolic load caused by in-\nsertion and\/or expression of pAG408.\nFig. 1. Growth of P. brassicacearum strains Am3 (closed squares and\ncircles) and T8-1 (open squares and circles) on a liquid SMY medium\nsupplemented with 5 mM (NH4)2SO4 (closed and open squares) or\n10 mM ACC (closed and open circles). OD stands for optical density\nof bacterial suspensions at 540 nm. In all instances the standard error\nof the means is smaller than the symbol size. The data are of one of\ntwo representative experiments.\n1488 Belimov et al.\n at Lancaster University on 16 December 2009 http:\/\/jxb.oxfordjournals.orgDownloaded from \nFilter paper culture\nAll P. brassicacearum strains caused stepwise changes in\ntomato root elongation depending on the concentration of\nbacteria in the nutrient solution (Fig. 2). Pseudomonas\nbrassicacearum Am3 stimulated (by 8%), had no effect,\nand inhibited (by 25%) root elongation in the presence of\n106, 107, and 108 cells ml\u00011, respectively. The mutant T8-1\nhad no effect on roots at 106 cells ml\u00011 and significantly\ninhibited root elongation at higher bacterial concentra-\ntions. Significant (P <0.05) differences between treatments\nwith wild-type Am3 and the mutant T8-1 occurred in the\npresence of 107 and 108 cells ml\u00011. Pseudomonas\nbrassicacearum 520-1 significantly inhibited root elonga-\ntion at all bacterial concentrations used. Visual observa-\ntions revealed no visible disease symptoms on the roots\ninoculated with P. brassicacearum strains, except a brown-\nish root colour in the presence of Am3 and T8-1 at\n108 cells ml\u00011 and in the presence of 520-1 at 107 and\nespecially at 108 cells ml\u00011. Contrary to these observations,\nstrains Pseudomonas sp. Dp2 and V. paradoxus 5C-2, ap-\nplied as positive controls, significantly stimulated tomato\nroot elongation irrespective of bacterial concentration.\nTreatments with chemical inhibitors of ethylene biosyn-\nthesis (AVG and Co2+) and action (Ag+) also stimulated\nroot elongation to a similar extent as strains Dp2 and 5C-2.\nAddition of Co2+ to the solution supplemented with\nbacteria (107 cells ml\u00011) partially alleviated root length\ninhibition by strains T8-1 and 520-1, increased the stimu-\nlating effect of 5C-2, and tended to increase root length of\nseedlings in the presence of strains Am3 and Dp2.\nThere was no significant difference between the number\nof P. brassicacearum Am3 and T8-1 on tomato roots\n(Table 3). Similar numbers of bacteria on roots detected\non BPF medium, with and without necessary antibiotics,\nconfirmed a high stability of Tn5-mob and pAG408 inser-\nted into the tagged strains, and suggested that genetic\nmodifications had no effect on colonization ability of\nbacteria. No contamination of roots with extraneous\nmicroorganisms was detected. The attempt to visualize\nthe bacteria on roots using laser scanning confocal micros-\ncopy was not successful because the root tissues had very\nhigh auto-fluorescence.\nAgar culture\nStudy with a microscope showed that distribution of the\nintroduced bacteria on roots was relatively random. Single\ncells and small microcolonies presented along the root\nsegments and dividing bacterial cells (pairs of cells) were\noften observed, suggesting that multiplication of the\nbacteria occurred and the bacteria were in an active\nphysiological state (Fig. 3A, B). Few larger microcolonies\nwere also observed on the root surface where the bacteria\nwere localized in a mucilage layer, but no bacteria were\nobserved inside root tissues (Fig. 3C). No visible differ-\nences were found between P. brassicacearum Am3RF\nand its mutant T8-1RF in their root colonization patterns.\nStudy with a microscope and visual observations revealed\nno morphological changes or disease symptoms such as\nnecrotic spots, browning, lesions, and other root tissue\ndamage caused by inoculation with either Am3RF or\nT8-1RF. Enumeration of bacteria using the root homog-\nenate serial dilution method showed that the root coloni-\nzation capability of P. brassicacearum Am3RF and its\nmutant T8-1RF was similar and the GFP-tagged cells\ncomprised all the introduced bacteria (Table 2). No con-\ntamination of roots with extraneous microorganisms was\ndetected.\nTable 2. ACC deaminase activity of the strains studied\nThe data are given as means 6SE of four experiments.

Visual observations revealed no disease symptoms\non roots and shoots caused by any of the strains used. The\nintroduced strains Am3RF and T8-1RF were detected at\nlevels of several hundreds of cells per milligram root FW\nduring the course of the experiment (Table 3). Visualiza-\ntion of GFP-tagged bacteria on roots using light micros-\ncopy revealed few cells per field of vision; however, no\nrepresentative pictures were taken because of the rela-\ntively low number of cells on the roots and the high\nfluorescence level of root tissues and some soil particles\n(data not shown).\nIn experiment 2, all plants injected with suspensions of\nP. brassicacearum strains had necrotic brown lesions\ninside the stems localized in pith tissue above the injection\npoint (Table 4; Fig. 3D). Longitudinal stem sections\nshowed that lesion size increased during the course of the\nexperiment and was maximal on plants wound-infected\nwith strain 520-1 (Table 4). Injection with 520-1 de-\ncreased shoot biomass by 17%, whereas the effect of\ninjections with Am3RF and T8-1RF on shoot weight was\nnot significant. Leaves of the infected plants showed no\nchlorosis or other disease symptoms. The introduced\nstrains Am3RF and T8-1RF were detected in necrotic\nbrown lesions of stems by light microscopy (Fig. 3E, F).\nThe bacteria formed numerous microcolonies located on\nplant cell walls. No bacteria were observed outside the\nlesions (data not shown), suggesting that bacterial pro-\nliferation and infection were restricted by the plant to the\nlesion zone. The number of each of the introduced strains\ninhabiting stem lesions was similar at both 26 d and 54\nd after wound-infection and the number of strain 520-1\nwas about twice more than strains Am3RF and T8-1RF\n(Table 4).\nIn experiment 3, the number of infected plants having\nnecrotic lesions inside the stems was maximal after\ninfection with P. corrugata 176, whereas the negative\ncontrol strain Pseudomonas sp. Dp2 induced no lesions,\nand only three plants with lesions were observed after\ninfection with V. paradoxus 5C-2 (Table 4). Lesion\ndimensions were significantly less than in experiment 2,\nand no significant genotypic differences were observed\nbetween tomato cultivars or between lesion-inducing\nstrains. Shoot biomass was not affected by bacterial\ninoculation. Bacterial numbers in the stem lesions were\nsimilar for all the pseudomonad strains, whereas the\nnumber of 5C-2 was about 20 times less (Table 4). No\nbacteria were found in the stem when strain Dp2 was\ninjected.\nTomato fruit infection bioassay\nAll fruits infected with P. brassicacearun Am3, T8-1, and\n520-1 and P. corrugata 176 had brown lesions in the\nTable 3.

Recently, Blaha et al. (2006) detected\nthe ACC deaminase gene in a number of phytopatho-\ngenic Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains, in Burkholderia\ngladioli LMG2216, B. caryophylli LMG2155, and B.\ncepacia LMG1222, and showed that strain LMG1222\npossessed ACC deaminase activity in vitro. Furthermore,\nit is shown here that an ACC deaminase-containing\nbacterium (P. brassicacearum Am3), characterized as\na PGPR for pea, rape, and Indian mustard (Belimov\net al., 2001; Safronova et al., 2006), is pathogenic for\ntomato.\nThe effects of P. brassicacearum strain Am3 (and\nparticularly its ACC deaminase-deficient T8-1 mutant)\nresembled those of phytopathogenic strain 520-1 on\nin vitro root elongation in the presence of high bacterial\nconcentrations (107 and 108 cells ml\u00011) (Fig. 2). However,\nat low cell concentrations (106 cells ml\u00011), strain Am3\nstimulated root elongation in filter paper culture (Fig. 2)\nand increased biomass of plants grown in inoculated soil\n(Fig. 4). By contrast, P. brassicacearum strains 520-1 and\nT8-1 had no detectable effect on biomass of plants grown\nin inoculated soil. Pseudomonas brassicacearum Am3\n(and T8-1) successfully colonized the root surface of both\nin vitro and in soil-grown plants (Table 3), in agreement\nwith previous reports describing this species as a common\nrhizosphere bacterium (Achouak et al., 2004). However, it\nwas not able to infect plant tissues when bacterial cells\nwere present around the root surface of nutrient solution-\nor soil-grown plants.\nDisease symptoms (necrotic lesions) caused by\nP. brassicacearum were only evident when bacteria were\ninjected into wounded plant tissues (stem or fruit). The\narea of damaged stem tissues was limited, and infiltrated\nbacteria were found in this area only (Table 4). Localiza-\ntion of bacteria in the pith might be associated with\nreduced resistance of this tissue to bacterial toxicity.\nNecrosis of tomato stem pith is a typical disease symptom\ninduced by the phytopathogen P. corrugata (Sutra et al.,\n1997), a species closely related to P. brassicacearum\n(Achouak et al., 2000). Although bacteria were introduced\nto the plant stem using a similar technique to Sikorski\net al. (2001), the response of tomato cv. Ailsa Craig and\ncv. Moneymaker in the present experiments was much\nless pronounced than the chlorosis, vascular browning,\nand necrotic lesions on leaflets reported in cv. Money-\nmaker (Sikorski et al., 2001). In particular, very small\nstem pith lesions induced by P. brassicacearum and\nP. corrugata were observed in experiment 3 on both\ncultivars. At present, much of the biology of tomato\ndisease caused by P. corrugata is not well understood, but\ndisease severity appears to be worse when temperature is\nlow and humidity is high (Momol and Pernezny, 2006).\nClimatic data for St-Petersburg (http:\/\/www.pogoda.ru.net)\nshowed that conditions (mean temperature and monthly\nprecipitation) for disease development were more condu-\ncive in experiment 2 (17.8 \u0001C; 85 mm month\u00011) than\nexperiment 3 (19.1 \u0001C; 16 mm month\u00011). Therefore, it is\nsuggested that phytopathogenicity of P. brassicacearum\ndepends on plant genotype and environmental con-\nditions, and occurs particularly when bacteria invade\n(penetrate) wounded plant tissues, a property characteristic\nof \u2018opportunistic\u2019 pathogenesis.\nIt is possible that the inhibition of root elongation\nin vitro and necrotic lesions observed in wound-infected\ntomato stems and fruits caused by P. brassicacearum\nstrains Am3 and 520-1 were due to production of bacterial\ntoxins. Various phytopathogenic Pseudomonas species\nproduce a wide spectrum of phytotoxic compounds\n(Bender et al., 1999), and the phytotoxin coronatine from\nP. syringae inhibited root growth of Arabidopsis thaliana\n(Feys et al., 1994) and wheat (Sakai, 1980). Toxins\nFig. 4. Shoot and root biomass of tomato cv. Ailsa Craig grown in soil\nsupplemented with P. brassicacearum strains.

The\nethylene-insensitive tomato mutant Never ripe (Nr)\nshowed significant reduction in disease symptoms in\nresponse to different pathogens including P. syringae,\nsuggesting that stress ethylene evolution can promote\ndisease development (Lund et al., 1998). Analogously, the\nreduced ethylene biosynthesis in tomato plants trans-\nformed with bacterial ACC deaminase from Enterobacter\ncloacae UW4 decreased disease symptoms of Verticillum\nwilt (Robison et al., 2001). In agreement with these\nobservations that decreasing plant ethylene sensitivity or\nbiosynthesis can limit disease development, it is shown\nhere that ACC deaminase activity of the phytopatho-\ngenic bacterium P. brassicacearum Am3 counteracted\nits phytotoxic effects. This hypothesis relies on previous\nobservations that rhizosphere inoculation with ACC de-\naminase-containing bacteria decreases root ACC levels\nand ethylene evolution (Burd et al., 1998; Penrose et al.,\n2001; Belimov et al., 2002; Mayak et al., 2004). Indeed,\nthe ACC deaminase-deficient mutant T8-1 decreased root\nelongation and biomass production in comparison with the\nwild-type Am3. Furthermore, the chemical inhibitor of\nethylene biosynthesis Co2+ partially alleviated in vitro\ngrowth inhibition caused by the T8-1 mutant, but not by\nwild-type Am3. In this context, it should be noted also\nthat P. brassicacearum Am3 does not produce ethylene\nand auxins (Belimov et al., 2001), although many\npseudomonads produce ethylene or auxins that may\npromote infection (Weingart and Volksch, 1997) or inhibit\nroot growth (Persello-Cartieaux et al., 2001), respectively.\nStimulation of tomato root elongation at a low cell\nconcentration (106 cells ml\u00011) and an increase in root\nbiomass observed in soil culture suggest that, under\nTable 4.

By contrast, the effects of other PGPR\n(Pseudomonas sp. Dp2 and V. paradoxus 5C-2) were\nindependent of bacterial concentration in the nutrient\nsolution (Fig. 2). Pseudomonas brassicacearum Am3 was\ninitially isolated as a PGPR that stimulated root elongation\nof Indian mustard and rape in the presence of a high cell\nconcentration (53107 cells ml\u00011) and increased growth of\nthe inoculated rape and pea plants in pot experiments\n(Belimov et al., 2001; Safronova et al., 2006). Here,\nexperiments with tomato cultivar Ailsa Craig showed that\na particular bacterial strain might exert either beneficial or\ndeleterious effects on plant growth depending on plant\nspecies, concentration of bacteria, and growth conditions.\nThis observation may be of crucial importance for\ninvestigations aimed at isolation, characterization, and\nfurther application of PGPR as biopreparations in agricul-\nture that presupposes a large-scale release of bacteria to\nthe environment.\nColonization of tomato roots and wound-infected stems\nby P. brassicacearum Am3 and its mutant T8-1 was\nsimilar, suggesting that (i) the difference between\nthe effects of Am3 and T8-1 on plants was not related to\nthe colonization ability of the strains, and (ii) lowering the\nACC deaminase activity did not affect colonization and\ndistribution of the bacteria associated with the plant. The\nlatter observation suggests that the utilization of ACC as\na nutrient substance gives the bacteria no advantages in\ncolonization of rhizosphere or plant tissues. By contrast, it\nis likely that P. brassicacearum may use ACC deaminase\nas a tool for masking (swindling) their intention for\ninfection via decreasing the stress induced by toxins and\nimpeding plant recognition of an \u2018opportunistic\u2019 pathogen,\nsince ethylene is a key signal intermediate in the\nexpression of induced systemic resistance in plants (Van\nLoon et al., 1998). Interestingly, E. cloacae (recently\nreclassified as P. putida by Hontzeas et al., 2005) strain\nUW4, but not its ACC deaminase minus mutant UW4\/\nAcdS\u0001, caused down-regulation of stress-related genes\nencoding glycine-rich RNA-binding protein and ras-\nGTPase-activating protein in canola roots (Hontzeas\net al., 2004).\nIn conclusion, the interactions between plants and\nPseudomonas are very variable, since this genus has plant\ngrowth-promoting, saprophytic, deleterious, and phyto-\npathogenic species and strains, and in many cases it is\ndifficult to discriminate between beneficial and injurious\nindividuals (Preston, 2004). The present data reinforce this\nview, as a single strain (P. brassicacearum Am3) can\nhave growth-promoting, neutral, or phytopathogenic\neffects on growth of a single plant cultivar according to\nthe dose and environmental conditions. The outcome of\nthe P. brassicacearum\u2013tomato interaction is influenced by\nbacterial ACC deaminase activity, as decreasing this\nactivity modified the root growth response of tomatoes to\ninoculation. Whether the coincidence of bacterial proper-\nties such as ACC degradation and phytopathogenicity\nis a casual circumstance or interdependent, and the role\nthat ACC deaminase plays in pathogenesis require further\nstudy.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors are very grateful to Dr W Wackernagel for kindly\nsupplying strain P. brassicacearum 520-1, to Dr TC Charles for sup-\nplying strain E. coli S17-1::pAG408, to Dr AM Lazarev for\nsupplying strain P. corrugata 176, to Prof. BR Glick for valuable\ndiscussions, and to Mr J Dent and Mr AG Pinaev for valuable\nassistance in confocal laser scanning and fluorescence light\nmicroscopy, respectively.
