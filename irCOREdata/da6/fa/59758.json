Sites MAT-1 to MAT-3 represent the most sensitive and \naccessible locations for bringing the NJ\/MAT to a successful conclusion.3\nExpedition 313 Scientific ProspectusSchedule for Expedition 313\nExpedition 313 is based on Integrated Ocean Drilling Program drilling proposal num-\nber 564 (available at www.eso.ecord.org\/docs\/564.pdf). Following ranking by the \nIODP Scientific Advisory Structure, the expedition was scheduled for the drilling plat-\nform LB Kayd, operating under contract with the European Implementing Organiza-\ntion. The expedition is currently scheduled to start at Atlantic City, NJ (USA), on 2 \nMay 2009 and to end in Atlantic City on 22 July 2009 (estimate). An estimated 80 \ndays will be available for the drilling, coring, and downhole measurements described \nin this report (for the current detailed schedule, see www.iodp.org\/).\nIntroduction\nEustasy as a global phenomenon\nUnderstanding the history, cause, and impact of sea level fluctuations is a compelling \ngoal of Earth system research. Not only are worldwide effects of encroaching shore-\nlines evident today\u2014the rate of this change is clearly increasing. Whereas global sea \nlevel rise during the previous century was ~1.8 mm\/y (Church and White, 2006), to-\nday that rate is ~3.25 mm\/y (Cazenave et al., 2009), in part due to anthropogenic in-\nfluences (Barnett, 1990). Furthermore, in many coastal regions the rate is still higher \nbecause of the additional effect of local subsidence. The geologic record shows that \nglobal sea level has fluctuated by well over 100 m (summaries in Donovan et al., 1979) \nat rates as high as 20\u201340 mm\/y (Fairbanks, 1989; Stanford et al., 2006). The impor-\ntance of carefully examining the geologic record for eustatic variations goes beyond \npreparing for a sea level rise of 0.4 m or more during this century. Indeed, Integrated \nOcean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 313 will not address the centennial tim-\nescale; for that, strategies synthesizing tide gauge and Holocene marsh records are re-\nquired. Instead, this study leads toward a broader understanding of the long-term \nbehavior and wide-ranging effects of the divide between land and ocean. Throughout \nEarth\u2019s history, the transfer of energy and material across this boundary has pro-\nfoundly influenced the interactions among the lithosphere, biosphere (e.g., Katz et \nal., 2005), and atmosphere and continues to affect the balance of these systems today. \nWeathering rates, sediment distribution, stratal architecture, carbon burial, and glaci-\nation are just a few of the myriad processes that are intertwined with eustatic change.4\nExpedition 313 Scientific ProspectusDespite its importance, knowledge of the basic amplitudes and rates of sea level vari-\nations on timescales of tens of thousands to millions of years is surprisingly limited. \nOur goal is to address this deficiency in the way endorsed by numerous study groups \n(e.g., Imbrie et al., 1987; JOIDES Pollution Prevention and Safety Panel, 1992): by \nsampling key facies across the prograding deposits of a passive continental margin at \nproposed Sites MAT-1, MAT-2, and MAT-3.\nUnraveling eustasy from the effects of subsidence and sediment supply requires a fun-\ndamental understanding of passive margin response to sedimentation. Deposits adja-\ncent to the shoreline are replete with stratal discontinuities on all spatial scales, \nincluding sequence boundaries and regional unconformities associated with evidence \nfor base-level lowering (Vail et al., 1977; Posamentier et al., 1988). Sequence bound-\naries provide a means to objectively subdivide the stratigraphic record (Christie-Blick \net al., 1990; Christie-Blick, 1990), and the intervening sedimentary sequences provide \nthe basis for evaluating controls on sedimentary architecture and predicting sedimen-\ntary facies and societally important resource distributions (e.g., hydrocarbons and po-\ntable water) (Vail et al., 1977; Sugarman et al., 2006). Remarkably similar sequence \narchitecture occurs on margins of widely contrasting tectonic and sedimentary histo-\nries (e.g., Bartek et al., 1991), emphasizing the fact that eustasy exerts a fundamental, \nworldwide control on the stratigraphic record. Nevertheless, it is clear that tectonism \nand changes in sediment supply also have molded the stratigraphic record (e.g., Reyn-\nolds et al., 1991); the challenge is to isolate the imprint of each of these influences.\nSequence stratigraphy provides a powerful tool for deciphering margin records, but \nmany of its fundamental assumptions have not been tested. For example, although \nthe facies models of Exxon Production Research Company (e.g., Posamentier et al., \n1988) are widely applied, the nature of facies associated with prograding clinoforms \nhas not been publicly documented (although Ocean Drilling Program [ODP] Legs 166 \nand 174A made good contributions). Furthermore, the timing and phase relation-\nships of facies distributions with respect to sea level change have not been evaluated \n(e.g., Reynolds et al., 1991). More importantly, the sequence stratigraphic record has \nbeen used to extract a eustatic history, despite the fact that critical assumptions (e.g., \nthe water depth at the lowest point of onlap; Greenlee and Moore 1988, see discus-\nsion below) have not been tested.5\nExpedition 313 Scientific ProspectusEustatic unknowns: amplitude, response, and mechanism\nMeasuring the geologic record of amplitudes of eustatic change is a difficult task. Al-\nthough deep-sea \u03b418O records provide precise timing of glacio-eustatic changes (Miller \net al., 1991, 1996a, 2005a), eustatic amplitudes can be estimated using \u03b418O to no bet-\nter than \u00b120% for the past few million years and \u00b150% prior to that because of as-\nsumptions about paleotemperature and application of the Pleistocene sea level\/\u03b4w\ncalibration of Fairbanks and Matthews (1978) to the older record (Miller et al., 2005a). \nCarbonate atolls have been sampled as fossil \u201cdip sticks\u201d (e.g., ODP Legs 143 and 144), \nand although this approach has been successful for the Pleistocene (Fairbanks, 1989), \nrecovery and age control for records older than the late Pleistocene have posed very \nlarge challenges. As noted above, continental margin sediments have long been re-\ngarded as a viable source for extracting eustasy (e.g., Vail, 1977; Watts and Steckler, \n1979; Haq et al., 1987; Greenlee and Moore, 1988), provided the effects of total sub-\nsidence (compaction, loading, and cooling), as well as changes in sediment supply, \ncould be removed.\nDrilling into the New Jersey shallow shelf as we propose will allow us to evaluate the \nseveral controls on the stratigraphic record at passive margins. It was known that \ndrilling on the New Jersey continental slope during ODP Leg 150 (Mountain, Miller, \nBlum, et al., 1994) would yield virtually no information concerning amplitudes. By \ncontrast, it was expected that the coastal plain drilling during ODP Leg 150X (Miller \net al., 1994, 1996b) and later ODP Leg 174AX (Miller et al., 1998, 2003, 2004, 2005a; \nMiller, Sugarman, Browning, et al., 1998; Kominz et al., 2008) would provide valuable \nconstraints on how high sea level rose during the last 100 m.y. Although onshore \nanalyses have borne this out (Fig. F1), they have been based on incomplete Miocene \nand younger sections dating from times when the shoreline was frequently seaward \nof its current position (Kominz et al., 1998). By contrast, the Late Cretaceous to Oli-\ngocene shoreline was often landward of the coastal plain wells and, as a result, eus-\ntatic amplitudes from these sections have been shown to be as large or larger than \nthose of the Miocene (Fig. F1) (Miller et al., 2005a). Analyses from ODP Leg 194 on \nthe Marion Plateau (John et al., 2004) clearly show that the New Jersey onshore sites \ndo not capture the full amplitude of Miocene sea level change. Though backstripping \nthe Marion Plateau data provided a relatively precise estimate of 56.5 \u00b1 11.5 m for a \nlate middle Miocene fall (John et al., 2004), it did not address estimates of other Mio-\ncene events. The New Jersey continental shelf, particularly the inner to middle shelf \nwhere we propose to drill Sites MAT-1 to MAT-3, is much better suited for estimating \nlate Oligocene\u2013Miocene eustatic amplitudes because sediments at this location are 6\nExpedition 313 Scientific Prospectusstratigraphically more complete, record the full range of water depth variations, and \nprovide the facies needed to estimate eustatic amplitudes.\nVarious facies models have been proposed to explain shelf sedimentation in response \nto eustatic changes (e.g., Posamentier et al., 1988; Galloway, 1989), but the fact re-\nmains the response of passive margin sedimentation to large, rapid sea level changes \nis not well known. One of the main reasons for this situation is the scarcity of direct \nsampling of well-imaged seismic sequences in the regions most affected by sea level \nchange. Understanding the amplitude of sea level change and sedimentation re-\nsponse requires knowledge of the depositional setting of strata that onlap sequence \nboundaries, but without samples it cannot be known if this onlap is coastal, marginal \nmarine, or deep marine (~100 m or more, as suggested by Greenlee and Moore, 1988). \nFurthermore, the depositional significance (e.g., shoreface versus midshelf) of the \nclinoform inflection point, a critical constraint in facies interpretation, has been in-\nferred mostly through forward models, although tantalizing evidence recovered from \nLeg 174A Hole 1071F suggests a marginal marine setting ~3.5 km landward of one late \nmiddle Miocene clinoform inflection point (Austin, Christie-Blick, Malone, et al., \n1998). Continued analysis of Leg 174A sequences will shed new light on shelf facies \nmodels and their predictions from seismic data, but these data were limited by low \ncore recovery and penetration of only upper middle Miocene and younger strata, \nhampering efforts to establish reliable facies models. Drilling at proposed Sites MAT-\n1 to MAT-3 will provide the information needed to properly evaluate depositional fa-\ncies models.\nGlacioeustasy (Donovan et al., 1979) is the only known mechanism for producing the \nlarge, rapid eustatic changes that have been reported for the past 200 m.y. (Miller et \nal., 2005a). Previous studies of the New Jersey margin have shown that changes in ice \nvolume are the dominant mechanism causing eustatic changes in the last 42 m.y. \n(Miller et al., 1996a, 1998). Most researchers have assumed that Earth was ice-free dur-\ning Cretaceous to Eocene times; however, Stoll and Schrag (1996) and Miller et al. \n(1999, 2004, 2005a, 2005b) have argued that there were ice sheets during the Creta-\nceous to early Eocene. One of the sites we plan to drill, Site MAT-1, is intended to re-\ncover a Paleocene\u2013Eocene record that will address this fundamental issue.\nThe importance of eustasy versus tectonism to the formation and preservation of se-\nquences is a long-standing debate that our proposed drilling will address. Tectonism \nin this context includes phenomena that operate across a large range of scales in both \ntime and space (i.e., from rapid, narrowly focused \u201cactive\u201d processes such as faulting 7\nExpedition 313 Scientific Prospectusand salt intrusion to the slower and more laterally extensive \u201cpassive\u201d process of flex-\nural loading). We have backstripped seven onshore boreholes (Kominz et al., 1998, \n2008; Van Sickle et al., 2004; see summary in Miller et al., 2005b) and have shown \nthat active tectonics has played a minimal role in Cenozoic onshore deposition. By \ncontrast, backstripping has shown that flexural loading led to ~30 m of excess subsid-\nence at onshore Delaware wells versus those in New Jersey beginning at ~21\u201312 Ma. \nThis enhanced subsidence is attributed to a local flexural response to the load of thick \nsequences prograding offshore Delaware (Browning et al., 2006). Based on this, we \nhypothesize that\n\u2022 Eustatic change is a first-order control on accommodation space and provides a si-\nmultaneous imprint on all continental margins;\n\u2022 Tectonic change due to movement of the crust can overprint the record and result \nin large gaps, though this effect is not apparent in New Jersey Miocene sequences; \nand\n\u2022 Second-order differences in sequences can be attributed to local flexural loading ef-\nfects, particularly in regions experiencing large-scale progradation.\nSites MAT-1 to MAT-3 (Fig. F2) provide the crucial link in the onshore\u2013offshore \ntransect (Fig. F3) required to evaluate eustasy versus local lithospheric flexure on the \ndevelopment of prograding late Oligocene\u2013Miocene sequences.\nThe New Jersey margin: its suitability, results, and promise\nThe New Jersey margin is an ideal location to investigate the history of sea level \nchange and its relationship to sequence stratigraphy for several reasons: rapid depo-\nsitional rates, tectonic stability, and well-preserved, cosmopolitan fossils suitable for \nage control characterize the sediments of this margin throughout the time interval of \ninterest (see summary in Miller and Mountain, 1994). In addition, there exists a large \nset of seismic, well log, and borehole data with which to frame the general geologic \nsetting from the coastal plain across the shelf to the slope and rise (Miller and Moun-\ntain, 1994) (Figs. F2, F3).\nDrilling into the New Jersey slope (ODP Sites 902\u2013904 and 1073) and the Coastal \nPlain (Island Beach, Atlantic City, Cape May, Bass River, Ancora, Oceanview, Bethany \nBeach, Millvile, Fort Mott, Sea Girt, and Cape May Zoo) has provided a chronology \nfor sea level changes over the past 100 m.y. (Miller and Snyder, 1997; Miller et al., \n1998, 2005a). Sequence boundaries from 10 to 42 Ma have been shown to correlate 8\nExpedition 313 Scientific Prospectus(within \u00b10.5 m.y.) both regionally (onshore\u2013offshore) and interregionally (New Jer-\nsey\u2013Alabama\u2013Bahamas), as well as globally, with glacio-eustatic lowerings inferred \nfrom the \u03b418O record (Fig. F4). These correlations establish a firm link between late \nmiddle Eocene to middle Miocene glacio-eustatic change and margin erosion on the \nmillion year scale. Oxygen isotopic studies of slope Site 904 provide prima facie evi-\ndence for a causal connection between Miocene \u03b418O increases (inferred glacio-eus-\ntatic falls) and sequence boundaries (Miller, Sugarman, Browning, et al., 1998). \nResults of these studies are consistent with the general number and timing of Late \nCretaceous to middle Miocene sequences initially published by Exxon (Vail and \nMitchum, 1977), although the Exxon group\u2019s sea level amplitudes are substantially \nhigher than those derived in New Jersey studies (Miller et al., 1996b, 2005a; Miller, \nSugarman, Browning, et al., 1998; Van Sickel et al., 2004).\nAided by easier access to older strata than is found downdip\/offshore, New Jersey \nCoastal Plain drilling (Miller et al., 1994, 1996b; Miller, Sugarman, Browning, et al., \n1998) has sampled \u201cGreenhouse\u201d (Cretaceous to Eocene) sequences and addressed \ntheir relationship to global sea level changes. One surprising result has been to extend \nthe history of ice sheets back to a time previously considered to be ice-free (Late Cre-\ntaceous\u2013middle Eocene, Browning et al., 1996; mid-Maastrichtian, Miller et al., 1999, \n2005a, 2005b). Late Cretaceous to middle Eocene comparisons of onshore hiatuses\/\nsequence boundaries and \u03b418O indicate that growth and decay of small ice sheets (<30 \nm sea level equivalent) also occurred in this supposedly ice-free world (Browning et \nal., 1996; Miller et al., 1998, 2003, 2005a, 2005b).\nODP drilling in the Bahamas (Leg 166 and supplementary platform drilling; Eberli, \nSwart, Malone, et al., 1997) complements the results from New Jersey by providing a \nchronology of base-level lowerings (Fig. F4) and an evaluation of prograding carbon-\nate sequences.\nPublished results of drilling at the New Jersey and Bahamas margins validate the ap-\nproaches outlined by COSODII (Imbrie et al., 1987) and the JOIDES Seal Level Work-\ning Group (Loutit, 1992). In particular,\n\u2022 Each region has proved the age of sequence boundaries on margins can be deter-\nmined to better than \u00b10.5 m.y.;\n\u2022 Both regions have validated the \u201ctransect\u201d approach of drilling passive continental \nmargins (arrays of holes: onshore, shelf, and slope);9\nExpedition 313 Scientific Prospectus\u2022 The siliciclastic New Jersey margin and the carbonate Bahamas margin yield corre-\nlatable records of base-level change, as deduced from definitions of the chronos-\ntratigraphy of seismically observed stratal discontinuities; and\n\u2022 Orbital-scale stratigraphic resolution has been achieved on continental slopes and \ncarbonate platforms.\nDespite these advances in dating sequences and linking them to glacioeustasy, there \nare major gaps in our understanding of amplitudes, response of sedimentation, and \nmechanisms that drive eustatic change. Only by drilling in the region most sensitive \nto sea level change, the paleo-nearshore zone to inner shelf region of a passive mar-\ngin, can these gaps be filled.\nScientific objectives\n1. Provide a testable record of eustatic variations.\nBackstripping is a proven method for extracting amplitudes of global sea level from \npassive margin records (e.g., Watts and Steckler, 1979). One-dimensional backstrip-\nping is a technique that progressively removes the effects of sediment loading (includ-\ning the effects of compaction) and paleowater depth from basin subsidence. By \nmodeling thermal subsidence on a passive margin, the tectonic portion of subsidence \ncan be assessed and a eustatic estimate obtained (Kominz et al., 1998, 2008; Van Sickel \net al., 2004). Backstripping requires knowing relatively precise ages, paleodepths, and \nporosities of sediments, and each of these criteria are best obtained from borehole \ntransects. Such transects also allow application of two-dimensional backstripping \ntechniques that account for lithospheric flexural effects, increasing the precision of \nthe eustatic estimates (Steckler et al., 1999; Kominz and Pekar, 2001). The eustatic \ncomponent obtained from backstripping needs to be verified by comparing sea level \nrecords with other margins and those derived from \u03b418O estimates.\nDrilling at Sites MAT-1 to MAT-3 will allow us to make precise late Oligocene to early \nmiddle Miocene eustatic estimates using one- and two-dimensional backstripping as \ndescribed above. One- (Kominz et al., 1998; Van Sickel et al., 2004) and two-dimen-\nsional (Kominz and Pekar, 2001) backstripping of onshore New Jersey sites have pro-\nvided preliminary amplitude estimates of 10\u201360 m for million year\u2013scale variations, \nbut the estimates are incomplete, particularly for the Miocene, because most low-\nstand deposits are generally not represented (Miller, Sugarman, Browning, et al., 10\nExpedition 313 Scientific Prospectus1998; Miller et al., 2005a, and fig. F2 therein). Amplitude estimates derived from \u03b418O \nstudies require assumptions about temperature and the sea level\/\u03b4w calibration; al-\nthough the uncertainties are large, initial eustatic estimates based on \u03b418O records are \nconsistent with backstripping results (Fig. F1). Sites MAT-1 to MAT-3 are precisely lo-\ncated to recover as nearly a complete set of late Oligocene\u2013middle Miocene sequences \nas possible and, through backstripping, provide a much more direct measure of the \nfull range of amplitudes for this time interval.\nOnce we have obtained precise eustatic estimates from late Oligocene to early middle \nMiocene records at Sites MAT-1 to MAT-3, we will be able to extend our results to the \nolder and younger records. Middle Miocene through recent sediments record similar \nclinoform geometries on the New Jersey shelf; by applying calibrations of seismic pro-\nfiles and facies developed as part of this work, we should be able to derive eustatic es-\ntimates for the interval 16\u20130 Ma. In particular, deriving a firm, independent eustatic \nestimate from margin sediments will\n\u2022 Allow us to test temperature assumptions needed to make glacio-eustatic estimates \nfrom \u03b418O records (Fig. F1),\n\u2022 Provide an estimate of the Tertiary sea level\/\u03b4w calibration, and\n\u2022 Evaluate the Pekar (1999) and Pekar et al. (2002) calibration of 0.09\u2030\/10 m (versus \n0.11\u2030\/10 m for the late Pleistocene) that was based on backstripping an incom-\nplete coastal plain record.\nWhereas both backstripping and \u03b418O methods make inherently large assumptions, \nthe convergence of the two methods (Fig. F1) suggests that we will be able to produce \na testable eustatic model for the past 42 m.y. and perhaps for the older record as well.\n2. Test models of sedimentation on siliciclastic shelves.\nShallow-water records contain unconformities observed in outcrop or in the subsur-\nface at all spatial scales, whether they divide beds or basins. Unconformably bounded \nsequences are the fundamental building blocks of the shallow-water record (Sloss, \n1963; Van Wagoner et al., 1990; Christie-Blick, 1991). Researchers at the Exxon Pro-\nduction Research Company (Vail et al., 1977; Haq et al., 1987; Van Wagoner et al., \n1988; Posamentier et al., 1988) claimed that similarities in the ages of stratal uncon-\nformities pointed to global sea level (eustasy) as the overriding control. The resulting \n\u201ceustatic curve\u201d has remained controversial (e.g., Christie-Blick et al., 1990; Miall, \n1991), largely because of basic assumptions about the stratigraphic response to eus-\ntatic change and because the work relies in part on unpublished data. In response to 11\nExpedition 313 Scientific Prospectusthis controversy, Christie-Blick and Driscoll (1995), among others, pointed out that \nthe fundamental enterprise of interpreting the origin of layered rocks does not really \nrequire any assumptions about eustasy. They emphasized that sequence boundaries \nattest to changes in depositional base level. The timing of many of the Exxon Produc-\ntion Research Company sequence boundaries has been validated onshore New Jersey \nand correlated to the \u03b418O proxy of eustatic change (Miller et al., 1998, 2005a), \nthough other sequence boundaries on this and other margins may be tectonically de-\nrived. Whether sequence boundaries are caused by changes in eustasy, local tec-\ntonism, or sediment supply (Reynolds et al., 1991), disconformable surfaces \nirrefutably divide the shallow-water record into sequences. Whatever their cause, \nthese stratal breaks are real and they provide an objective means of analyzing the rock \nrecord.\nFacies between sequence boundaries vary in a coherent fashion, and various facies \nmodels have been proposed for shelf sedimentation (e.g., Posamentier et al., 1988; \nGalloway, 1989). Much work has been done by the exploration and academic com-\nmunities in testing and applying these models, and much has been learned. For ex-\nample, flooding surfaces (particularly maximum flooding surfaces) can be used to \nunravel stratigraphic stacking patterns (e.g., Galloway, 1989), whereas highstand de-\nposits are generally regressive and commonly serve as reservoirs for oil or water re-\nsources (e.g., Posamentier et al., 1988; Greenlee et al., 1992; Sugarman and Miller, \n1997; Sugarman et al., 2006). Nonetheless, predictions of facies models have not been \nwidely successful because they are the products of many unevaluated processes (Reyn-\nolds et al., 1991).\nOne major reason that models are still poorly constrained is that there has been no \npublicly available study of continuous cores across a prograding clinoform deposit \nthat constitutes the central element of many facies models. As a result, the water \ndepths in which clinoforms form and the distribution of lithofacies they contain are \nnot well known. It is widely debated whether clinoform tops ever become subaerially \nexposed during sea level lowstands and whether the shoreline ever retreats to (or per-\nhaps moves seaward of) the clinoform rollover (Fulthorpe and Austin, 1998; Austin et \nal., 1998; Steckler et al., 1999; Fulthorpe et al., 1999). Settling these controversies will \nhave significant implications on our understanding of how sequence boundaries de-\nvelop and how much of the facies distribution within clinoforms can be attributed to \neustasy. Some workers assume that the shoreline is always located at the clinoform \nrollover (e.g., Posamentier et al., 1988; Van Wagoner et al., 1990; Lawrence et al., \n1990). Others have presented models of basin evolution that suggest the shoreline 12\nExpedition 313 Scientific Prospectusand the clinoform rollover can move independently of each other (e.g., Steckler et al., \n1993, 1999). The sea level estimates of Greenlee and Moore (1988) argue that sea level \nfalls expose an entire continental shelf and that strata onlapping clinoform fronts are \ncoastal plain sediments deposited during the beginning of the subsequent sea level \nrise. Many researchers (e.g., Steckler et al., 1993) stress that if strata onlapping clino-\nform fronts were deposited at or near sea level, then the clinoform heights dictate that \nsea level occasionally fell hundreds of meters in less than a million years; such mag-\nnitudes and rates are beyond the reasonable scales of any known mechanism for eu-\nstatic change. Extracting the amplitude of sea level fluctuations from sequence \narchitecture is critically dependent on whether the lowest point of onlap onto se-\nquence boundaries is truly coastal or is deeper marine. Determining water depths at \nthe clinoform edge is essential to sequence stratigraphic models and understand this \nbasic element of the dynamic land-sea interface. It can only be established by sam-\npling, such as proposed here.\nProposed drill sites\nOptimal locations of Sites MAT-1, MAT-2, and MAT-3\nThe region between the paleo-shoreline and the paleo-inner to middle shelf is the \nmost sensitive region for studying past sea level variations and must be sampled to ob-\ntain estimates of eustatic amplitudes. Reliability of these estimates depends on the \nprecision of paleowater depths determined by lithologic and benthic foraminiferal \ncriteria. Both of these are optimal indicators in nearshore to middle neritic facies but \nbecome less precise in facies deeper than middle neritic (>100 m) paleodepths (see ex-\namples in Miller and Snyder, 1997). Sections deposited in nearshore to inner neritic \nenvironments (<30 m paleodepth) are difficult to date, even though the facies associ-\nations may be clearer and the paleodepth resolution is best. Work onshore New Jersey \nhas shown that the best results can be obtained by targeting sequences deposited be-\ntween 0 and 60 m paleodepth (Kominz and Pekar, 2001). Following these guidelines, \nas well as concepts developed by the JOIDES Sea Level Working Group (Loutit, 1992), \nthe ideal drilling locations are outlined in Figure F5.\nSites MAT-1 to MAT-3 target upper Oligocene to middle Miocene seismically imaged \nprograding clinoforms that were deposited in inner\u2013middle neritic paleodepths \n(based on coeval onshore strata deposited in nearshore\/prodelta settings). We have \nobtained excellent seismic profiles of these clinoforms (Fig. F6) across the regions that 13\nExpedition 313 Scientific Prospectusrecord the full amplitude of sea level change: immediately landward of and near the\ntoes of the clinoforms (i.e., across the clinoform inflection point). Modern water\ndepths at Sites MAT-1 to MAT-3 are ~34 m (Fig. F7; Table T1), a fortunate \u201ccrossover\u201d\ndepth between being too far landward for detailed control on sequence geometry (i.e.,\nthorough seismic control on land is not possible) and too far seaward for affordable\ncommercial drill rigs.\nSite location\nThree sites have been selected that lie along a dip-line transect (Fig. F7) roughly 45 to\n60 km offshore New Jersey in 32\u201335 m water depths; primary locations are Sites MAT-\n1A, MAT-2D, and MAT-3A (Table T1).\nAvailable site survey data at Sites MAT-1 to MAT-3\nThree MCS surveys have passed within 1 km of proposed Sites MAT-1 to MAT-3 (IODP\nSite Survey Databank):\n1. A reconnaissance grid using a 120-channel, 6-air gun system aboard the R\/V\nMaurice Ewing in 1990 was the first demonstration that Oligocene\u2013Miocene\nclinoforms were well developed at this location.\n2. The R\/V Oceanus returned with 48-channel, generator-injector gun, high-resolu-\ntion seismic equipment in 1995 and collected remarkably improved images of\nthese same features along Line 529.\n3. In 1998 the R\/V Cape Hatteras concentrated on three grids of 150\u2013600 m line\nspacing designed to provide detailed three-dimensional control on clinoform ge-\nometries, as well as to meet the guidelines established by the JOIDES Pollution\nPrevention and Safety Panel (1992).\nThese data have been studied to determine the location of any subsurface features\nthat may pose a hazard to drilling (amplitude anomalies suggesting trapped gas, faults\nthat could serve as conduits for deep-seated hydrocarbons, or indicators of unstable\nsettings for a jack-up rig).\nA Simrad EM1000 swath-bathymetry\/acoustic backscatter survey passed over the pro-\nposed drill sites during an U.S. Office of Naval Research\u2013supported STRATAFORM\nstudy in 1996. In June 1999 Joint Oceanographic Institutions, Inc.\/U.S. Science Advi-\nsory Committee (USSAC) supported the collection of additional Simrad EM3000 ba-\nthymetry and seafloor grab samples across Sites MAT-1 to MAT-3. A review of all data,14\nincluding reprocessing of the Cape Hatteras seismic data, was carried out by an inde-\nExpedition 313 Scientific Prospectuspendent site survey company (Guardline) for a gas hazard report. No significant gas \nhazards were found to affect any of the potential drilling locations. Finally, as a final \nexamination for seabed hazards and characterization, additional profiling, magne-\ntometer, and vibracore data were collected by Alpine Geophysical in Spring 2008 and \neach proposed site was determined safe for drilling.\nCoring strategy\nThe \u201cNew Jersey\/Mid-Atlantic Sea Level Transect\u201d (NJ\/MAT) was designed as a series \nof boreholes from the onshore New Jersey Coastal Plain across the shelf to the slope \nand rise (Miller and Mountain, 1994) (Figs. F1, F2) with the following goals:\n1. Date major \u201cIcehouse\u201d (Oligocene\u2013recent) sequences, a time of known glacio-eu-\nstatic change (Miller et al., 1991), and compare ages of the unconformable sur-\nfaces bracketing these sequences with times of sea level lowerings predicted from \nthe \u03b418O glacio-eustatic proxy;\n2. Estimate the amplitudes, rates, and mechanisms of sea level change; and\n3. Evaluate sequence stratigraphic facies models (e.g., systems tracts) (Posamentier \net al., 1988, Catuneanu, 2006) that predict depositional environments, sediment \ncompositions, and stratal geometries in response to sea level change.\nLeg 174A shelf drilling (Austin, Christie-Blick, Malone, et al., 1998) targeted similar \nupper Miocene\u2013Pliocene clinoforms beneath the modern outer shelf, demonstrated \nthat the multiple-site transect strategy is valid, and attempted to yield precise eustatic \nestimates across one upper Miocene sequence. Success was hampered by unstable \nhole conditions that led to moderate to poor recovery and the inability to reach sed-\niments older than 12 Ma. Proposed shallow shelf Sites MAT-1 to MAT-3 (Figs. F6, F7)\nare ideally located to sample sequence boundaries both landward and seaward of sev-\neral clinoform inflection points and to test the amplitudes of, and facies models for, \nlate Oligocene to middle Miocene sea level changes. Prime targets include sequence-\nbounding late Oligocene reflection \u201co1\u201d to middle Miocene \u201cm4\u201d (~28\u201314 Ma) (Mon-\nteverde et al., 2000).\nSite location details\nFor site location details, see Tables T2, T3, and T4. Total sediment penetration for the \nthree New Jersey margin sites is 2250 m.15\nExpedition 313 Scientific ProspectusOperational strategy\nDrilling platform\nThe required depth of the boreholes below seabed is 750 m. The water depth at all the \nsites is shallow (35 to 40 m), and thus a jack-up type rig has been selected to carry out \nthe coring for the project. The drilling platform, chosen by the contractor and in-\nspected by European Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling (ECORD) Science Op-\nerator (ESO), is the LB Kayd, which is a 245 class liftboat. Essentially this is a three-\nlegged, self propelled jack-up.\nThe coring rig will be cantilevered off the bow of the liftboat, between the two for-\nward jacking legs.\nThe Kayd will have sufficient capacity by way of food and accommodation for 24 h \noperation but will require frequent resupply, which will be carried out by a contrac-\ntor-arranged supply boat provisionally on a 7 day cycle. Exact scheduling will be con-\ntrolled by coring requirements and, particularly, the freshwater requirements of the \nrig.\nCoring rig\nThe coring rig is an Atlas Copco CS4002 mining rig utilizing flush-jointed mining \ndrill strings sized to allow the larger ones to act as casings if the coring requires it. The \nrig has a mast capable of handling 6 m string lengths, and coring is done with a top \ndrive system installed in the mast. Wireline operation of the core barrel is conducted \nthrough the top drive.\nCoring methodology\nA conductor pipe will be run to the seabed to protect the first drill string from exces-\nsive movement and vibration. Initially it may not be run into seabed to allow core \ncollection from the seabed, but following this it can be run to a suitable depth to \nmaintain top-hole stability for the rest of the coring.\nThe first coring string will be a Deep Observation and Sampling of the Earth\u2019s Conti-\nnental Crust (DOSECC) lake drilling system with a wireline core barrel and a PHD \n(mining pipe) or HWT (mining casing) flush-jointed drill string (114.3 mm outer di-\nameter [OD], 101.6 mm inner diameter [ID]). This system has interchangeable inner 16\nExpedition 313 Scientific Prospectuscore barrels. The outer core bit size will be ~160 mm, and the core collected will be \n~62 mm diameter. This is the \u201cstandard\u201d IODP core size and is collected in identical \nliners.\nThe annulus between the hole and drill string is small, which is key to obtaining a \nstable borehole in delicate formations. The outer core barrel is able to accept a variety \nof inner core barrels, which will help to maximize core recovery in unconsolidated \nand consolidated formations. The inner core barrel bit or cutting shoe is interchange-\nable with the inner core barrel, allowing a good degree of flexibility to ensure that best \ncore recovery and quality are obtained.\nThe maximum core run length will be 3 m. However, the length of a core run will be \ngeared to maximize the core recovery and maintain hole stability, even if this reduces \noverall penetration speed. In unconsolidated, sandy, or silty formations, these core \nruns could well be less than the 3 m maximum length.\nDrilling mud will be used to condition the borehole as dictated by the circumstances \nand the driller\u2019s requirements. Fluorescent microspheres will be added to the mud to \nassist the evaluation of contamination of samples for microbiology studies.\nShould it be impossible to reach the required total depth (TD) with a single drill \nstring, the first string will be used as a casing for the completed part of the borehole. \nWith the inner core barrel removed, sufficient clearance through the outer core barrel \nbit will be made available to allow a second string and core barrel to pass through and \nthus progress the borehole. This second drill string will also be a flush-jointed mining \nsystem (HQ; 96.0 mm OD, 63.5 mm ID) and has a matched HQ-size mining core bar-\nrel. The core is also collected in a liner and, because the hole diameter and annulus \nspacing are smaller, the core collected is essentially the same size as the first core (61 \nmm diameter).\nThe liner is standard mining type and different from the IODP liner. Both types of \nliner were provided to the curation and petrophysics teams for calibration.\nDrilling mud will also be used to condition this section of the borehole and to ensure \nthe top of the section does not deteriorate further than the point when it caused the \nsecond string to be deployed.\nAppropriate systems for gas monitoring will be used throughout the expedition. They \nwill be contractor- and ESO-supplied. Note that although such systems will be able to 17\nExpedition 313 Scientific Prospectusdetect and identify gas, they are empirical or semiquantitative at best and are not an-\nalytical instruments.\nCore on deck\nOnce the drilling operation commences and core begins to arrive on deck and after \ninitial labeling of cores, the operations team will be responsible for delivering the \ncores to the curation container. The operation will proceed using a changeover of in-\nner core barrels to ensure continuity of the coring operation in as timely a fashion as \npossible. The deck operators will deploy an empty core barrel immediately after the \nprevious one has been retrieved and then address the core removal and subsequent \nreadying of that core barrel for reuse. As the cores will be collected in a plastic liner, \nthe usual IODP curation procedures will be followed and will be documented in an \nESO Handbook.\nDownhole logging\nDuring all expeditions the downhole logging program will be integrated with the sci-\nentific objectives to ensure maximum scientific output. This may include the use of \nspecialist third-party tools.\nTo facilitate downhole measurements and core petrophysics for mission-specific plat-\nforms, the European Petrophysics Consortium (EPC) has been developing protocols \nfor use both offshore and as part of the Onshore Science Party.\nUnlike the D\/V Chikyu and riserless vessels where the pipe size will be constant and \nallows a standard set of logging tools to be deployed, mission-specific platforms have \nvariable pipe sizes and drill in a variety of water depths, each of which provides con-\nstraints on the anatomy of logging operations. Pipe diameter is the controlling factor, \nand it is envisaged that a wide range, from slim-line memory-mode tools to standard \noilfield tool suites, may be utilized. Water depth is also an important constraint be-\ncause some mission-specific platform expeditions will operate in very shallow territo-\nrial waters where the deployment of nuclear sources may be prohibited or be severely \nrestricted.\nThis service will be contracted as part of the services for the New Jersey shallow shelf \nexpedition and will be managed by the EPC. The logging equipment and team will be 18\nExpedition 313 Scientific Prospectusinterfaced for a seamless operation on the platform, ready to undertake any require-\nments as the project progresses.\nPriorities and potential program of work\nAll aspects of the following work program are subject to change as our knowledge of \nhole conditions and the timing of operational activities improves.\nThe New Jersey sites will be attempted in the following order: MAT-1, MAT-2, and \nMAT-3. Site MAT-2 is considered to be the most scientifically critical site. Site MAT-3 \nis considered to be the least scientifically critical site and may not be cored in its en-\ntirety if time runs out toward the end of the operation. If coring at Site MAT-1 is prob-\nlematic and slow, the Eocene section below the \u201co1\u201d reflector at Site MAT-1 will not \nbe cored, as it is considered to be a low-priority interval.\nIn all holes, we will core to TD (750 m) or the maximum depth possible, using the \nPHD string. Before continuing with the smaller diameter HQ string if required, a total \ngamma ray log will be taken through the PHD casing. After HQ coring, a total gamma \nray log will be taken through the HQ-cased section of the hole. Drilling will be paused \nto take in situ borehole temperature measurements if borehole conditions are favor-\nable.\nOpen-hole logging will commence after coring, most probably in increments to re-\nduce the risk of hole instability halting the logging runs. The exact pull-back incre-\nments will be defined on site when we will have better knowledge of the formations. \nIf HQ coring is utilized, the minimum pull-back of the first increment is at the depth \nwhere HQ coring commenced.\nNormally, and where hole stability allows, five wireline logging tools will be run at \neach site in this order: induction resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, sonic measure-\nments, spectral and total gamma ray, and mechanical caliper. The induction tool is \nthe most robust tool in this suite and, with minimal risk of damage, will confirm \nwhether the hole is open for additional logging tools while providing information \nabout porosity and formation fluids.\nVertical seismic profile (VSP) logging will commence over the entire open hole after \nall wireline logging is finished. If an unstable hole is indicated, a wiper trip to recon-\ndition the hole will be conducted before VSP logging is attempted. If the hole is found 19\nExpedition 313 Scientific Prospectusto be very unstable during the wireline logging runs, VSP logging will be attempted \nin increments, essentially as the fifth tool in the logging suite.\nVSP logging of Site MAT-2 is critical to meet the scientific objectives of the expedition. \nIf VSP logging of the first hole at Site MAT-2 is unsuccessful, a dedicated hole for VSP \nlogging may be drilled using a full-face bit (no coring) despite the potential reduction \nin available coring time this might cause at Site MAT-3. This will only be undertaken \nif VSP logging was successful at Site MAT-1, which will have demonstrated that the \nexpedition can run VSP logging in difficult, sand-prone formations. If Sites MAT-1 \nand MAT-2 both prove too challenging for VSP logging, then VSP logging will be at-\ntempted at Site MAT-3, which is suspected to be the least sand-prone site.\nIf the borehole remains open after VSP logging, and if time allows, a second low-pri-\nority suite of wireline tools may be run: hydrogeological, and acoustic imaging (in-\ncluding acoustic caliper).\nMarine mammal observation will be conducted by trained observers during VSP sur-\nveying.\nScience operations\nA sampling and measurements plan for Expedition 313 (see the \u201cAppendix\u201d) was \nprepared to meet the scientific objectives of IODP Proposal 564 following the recom-\nmendations of the Science Advisory Structure (SAS).\nOffshore science operations\nAfter due consideration, it has been decided that there will be no splitting of the cores \nat sea, as it will be more efficient to carry out most of the scientific analysis during the \nOnshore Science Party at Bremen. Therefore, only limited scientific analysis will be \ncarried out on board, and only a limited number of scientists will be required to sail. \nIt is currently planned that core will be cut on board into 1.5 m lengths and curated \n(www.marum.de\/en\/Offshore_core_curation_and_measurements.html). The \ncore catcher sample will be split and a visual description recorded. Samples will be \ntaken from appropriate lithologies at spot intervals for (1) preliminary mineralogy, (2) \n87Sr\/86Sr dating of shell fragments, and (3) dinocyst stratigraphy. These will be sent \nashore when possible for preparation and analysis by members of the Science Party at \nRutgers and Brock Universities. Results of these analyses will be made available to the 20\nExpedition 313 Scientific ProspectusScience Party in advance of the Onshore Science Party. Samples for microbiology and\ninterstitial water analysis will be taken and suitably stored. Some preliminary micro-\nbiology and pore water ephemeral property measurements will be conducted offshore\n(see \u201cMicrobiology\u201d and \u201cInorganic geochemistry\u201d in the \u201cAppendix\u201d). All cores\nwill be run through a multisensor core logger (MSCL) offshore, which measures\ngamma-derived density, P-wave velocity, electrical resistivity, and magnetic suscepti-\nbility (see the \u201cAppendix\u201d).\nStaffing\nScientific staffing is decided on the basis of task requirements and nominations from\nthe ECORD Science Support Advisory Committee (ESSAC), USSAC, Japan Drilling\nEarth Science Consortium (JDESC), and Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST).\nESO staffing is based on the need to carry out the drilling and scientific operations\nefficiently and safely.\nThe following ESO and science staffing amounts to a maximum of 18 participants and\nis the total for staff onboard at any one time:\nESO:\n\u2022 1 Operations Superintendent\n\u2022 1 Staff Scientist\n\u2022 1 Petrophysics Staff Scientist\n\u2022 1 ESO Petrophysicist\n\u2022 1 Curator\n\u2022 1 Curatorial representative (ESO technician)\n\u2022 2 Drilling Coordinators\n\u2022 1 ESO Geochemist\n\u2022 1 Database Manager\n\u2022 1 Electronics Engineer\n\u2022 2 Logging Contractors\nOffshore science team:\n\u2022 1 Co-Chief Scientist\n\u2022 1 Geochemist\n\u2022 1 Microbiologist (first site only)21\nExpedition 313 Scientific Prospectus\u2022 1 Petrophysicist\n\u2022 1 Sedimentologist\nPlatform science activities\nScience activities on the platform are confined to those essential for early sampling \nand logging and for safety and curation (see the \u201cAppendix\u201d). Scientific activities will \nbe as follows (please also refer to the online tutorial at www.marum.de\/en\/\nOffshore_core_curation_and_measurements.html):\n\u2022 Basic curation and labeling of core.\n\u2022 Shoe sample (core catcher [CC]) description and sampling for initial sedimentolog-\nical and micropaleontological analysis, including taking a CC image.\n\u2022 Core storage.\n\u2022 All cores will be run on the MSCL (gamma density, P-wave velocity, electrical resis-\ntivity, and magnetic susceptibility) (see the \u201cAppendix\u201d).\n\u2022 Pore water sampling and preservation, and analyses of ephemeral properties.\n\u2022 Microbiological sampling and preservation.\n\u2022 Associated data management of all activities (see below).\nIn order to carry out the science requirements on the platform with a small crew, a \nstaffing plan will be devised. The plan will require flexibility of approach from all par-\nticipants, with priority to safety, core recovery, curation, and procedures for the mea-\nsurement of ephemeral properties.\nReport preparation will take place on board as required by IODP Management Inter-\nnational, Inc. (IODP-MI); the reports to be compiled include\n\u2022 Daily and weekly operations and science reports to IODP-MI, Science Party mem-\nbers, and relevant parties. Scientific reports are provided by the Co-Chief Scientists.\n\u2022 Site summary reports to IODP-MI.\n\u2022 Technical Operations Report (submission to IODP-MI due 60 days postexpedition).\n\u2022 Completion of the offshore sections of the Expedition Reports section of the Pro-\nceedings volume (primarily the \u201cMethods\u201d chapter).\n\u2022 Operational Review report (submission to IODP-MI due 2 months postexpedition).\n\u2022 Press releases in line with IODP-MI outreach policy.\n\u2022 Information for posting on the ESO expedition Web site.22\nExpedition 313 Scientific ProspectusNew Jersey logging operations\nThe following is a generic list of minimum and additional logging tools that are in-\ntended to be run at each of the three proposed sites. The tools are listed by the forma-\ntion properties which they measure, and not by \u201coperator\u201d-based trademark names.\nHigh-priority suite:\n\u2022 Total through-pipe gamma ray intensity: for log-log and core-log correlation.\n\u2022 Induction resistivity: multiple usages, a robust measurement even under poor bore-\nhole conditions for the evaluation of porosity.\n\u2022 Sonic measurements: for core-log correlation, borehole-seismic integration, quality \ncontrol, etc.\n\u2022 Spectral and total gamma ray: for log-log and core-log correlation (total), clay typ-\ning, and mineralogy determination (spectral).\n\u2022 Magnetic susceptibility: for lithologic determination and core-log correlation.\n\u2022 Caliper: for quality control and borehole corrections.\n\u2022 VSP: direct measurement of acoustic traveltime for core\/borehole-seismic integra-\ntion.\n\u2022 In situ borehole temperature: an IODP minimum measurement to be measured \nduring drilling operations.\nLower-priority suite:\n\u2022 Hydrogeological (pH, eH, and temperature): borehole fluid characterization to de-\ntect fluid circulation.\n\u2022 Acoustic imaging (including acoustic caliper): for core-log correlation, stratigraphic \nanalyses, and oriented sedimentological and structural information.\nWireline logging will be carried out at all sites and will include the measurements \nlisted above, as hole conditions allow. As the borehole conditions that will be encoun-\ntered in New Jersey are anticipated to result in challenging conditions for wireline log-\nging, total gamma ray logs will be run though the drill pipe in order to obtain \ncontinuous (although attenuated) data. The open-hole sections where wireline log-\nging measurements are acquired will be carefully selected based on scientific objec-\ntives and borehole stability, and time will be spent to ensure the optimum data \nquality is acquired. Please see \u201cPriorities and potential program of work,\u201d above, \nfor more details on how the logging program will be implemented.23\nExpedition 313 Scientific ProspectusOnshore science activities\nThe Onshore Science Party is to be conducted under the supervision of Dr. Ursula \nR\u00f6hl, the manager of the IODP Bremen Core Repository. The scientific work will fol-\nlow that required by the prospectus and measurements plan to be developed in due \ncourse in conjunction with the Co-Chief Scientists.\nDetails of the facilities that will be available for the Onshore Science Party at the Bre-\nmen IODP Core Repository located in the MARUM building on the campus of the \nUniversity of Bremen can be found in the \u201cAppendix.\u201d Additional facilities can be \nmade available through continuing close cooperation with additional laboratories at \nthe MARUM-Center for Marine Environmental Sciences and the Department of Geo-\nsciences at Bremen University, as well as the Max Planck Institute for Marine Micro-\nbiology, all of which are situated nearby on campus.\nA staffing plan will be developed with the Co-Chief Scientists in order to ensure that \nall required analyses and subsampling can be carried out efficiently. The measure-\nment plan will take account of IODP specifications for quality assurance\/quality con-\ntrol (QA\/QC) procedures, which are being developed.\nIn view of the proposed geographical distribution of all Deep Sea Drilling Project \n(DSDP)\/ODP\/IODP cores, it is understood that the Bremen Core Repository will be the \nlong-term location for these Atlantic Ocean cores.\nReport preparation will take place during the Onshore Science Party as required by \nIODP-MI; the reports to be compiled include\n\u2022 Twice-weekly operations and science reports to IODP-MI and relevant parties. Sci-\nentific reports are provided by the Co-Chief Scientists.\n\u2022 Preliminary Report (submission to IODP Publication Services 1 week after Onshore \nScience Party).\n\u2022 Completion of the Expedition Reports section of the Proceedings volume (submis-\nsion to IODP Publication Services as soon as practically possible after the Onshore \nScience Party).\nStaffing\nESO:\n\u2022 1 Superintendent (Curation and Laboratory Manager)\n\u2022 1 Staff Scientist24\nExpedition 313 Scientific Prospectus\u2022 1 Assistant Superintendent (Assistant Curation and Laboratory Manager)\n\u2022 2 Petrophysics Staff Scientists\n\u2022 1 ESO Petrophysicist\n\u2022 2 Curators\n\u2022 2 Database Operators\n\u2022 1 Trainee Staff Scientist\n\u2022 1 Publications Specialist\n\u2022 Laboratory Team (provided by University of Bremen predominantly for nonpetro-\nphysics stations\/laboratories and by the EPC for petrophysics-related stations).\nExpedition scientists:\n\u2022 2 Co-Chief Scientists\n\u2022 6 sedimentologists\n\u2022 4 modelers (backstripping)\/stratigraphic correlators\n\u2022 3 petrophysicists\/physical property specialists\n\u2022 1 paleomagnetist\n\u2022 2 inorganic geochemists\n\u2022 1 dinocyst specialist\n\u2022 1 planktonic foraminifer specialist\n\u2022 1 benthic foraminifer specialist\n\u2022 1 terrestrial palynologist\n\u2022 1 nannofossil specialist\n\u2022 1 microbiologist\nData management strategy\nA data management plan for the expedition will be developed once the data require-\nments and operational logistics are finalized. The outline plan is as follows:\n\u2022 The primary data capture and management system will be the ExpeditionDIS (Drill-\ning Information System). This is a relational database. It will capture drilling, cura-\ntion, and geoscience metadata and data during the offshore and onshore phases of \nthe expedition.\n\u2022 The ExpeditionDIS includes tools for data input, visualization, report generation, \nand data export.25\nExpedition 313 Scientific Prospectus\u2022 The database can be accessed directly by other interpretation or decision-making \napplications if required.\n\u2022 A file server will be used for the storage of data not captured in the database (for \nexample, documents and image files) and the inputs\/outputs of any data process-\ning, interpretation, and visualization applications used during the expedition.\n\u2022 The EPC will manage the capture of downhole-log data, MSCL data, and physical \nproperties data. Logging metadata and MSCL data will be stored in the Expedition-\nDIS. Downhole logging data will be stored separately by the EPC for processing and \ncompositing.\n\u2022 Upon completion of the offshore phase of the expedition, the ExpeditionDIS data-\nbase and the file system will be transferred to Bremen to continue data capture dur-\ning the Onshore Science Party.\n\u2022 Between the end of the offshore phase and the start of the Onshore Science Party, \nthe expedition scientists will have access to the data via a password-protected Web \nsite.\n\u2022 Upon completion of the Onshore Science Party, expedition scientists will continue \nto have access to all data through a password-protected Web site throughout the \nmoratorium period.\n\u2022 During the moratorium, all metadata and data, apart from downhole-log data, will \nbe transferred to WDC-MARE\/PANGAEA for long-term data archive.\n\u2022 The downhole-log data will be transferred to the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observa-\ntory for long-term archive.\n\u2022 Cores and samples will be archived at the IODP Bremen Core Repository.\n\u2022 After the moratorium, all the expedition data will be made accessible to the public.\nDefinition of New Jersey shallow shelf Expedition Results data\nExpedition Results data for Expedition 313 (Table T5) include\n\u2022 All data collected on the drilling platform during the expedition.\n\u2022 All data derived from samples taken on the drilling platform that are defined as \nminimum measurements by the IODP Science and Technology Panel (STP).\n\u2022 All data derived from preliminary shore-based analyses of core catcher samples.\n\u2022 All data collected onshore during the Onshore Science Party.26\nExpedition 313 Scientific ProspectusSampling (and data sharing) requests\nThe IODP Sample, Data, and Obligations policy is available on the IODP Web site \n(www.iodp.org\/program-policies\/) and will apply to Expedition 313. This docu-\nment outlines the policy for distributing IODP samples and data and defines the ob-\nligations that sample and data recipients incur. A primary obligation is that all \nmembers of the scientific party must conduct expedition-related scientific research \nand publish their results by the determined deadline.\nAccess to data and core samples for specific research purposes during the expedition \nand the subsequent 1 y moratorium must be approved by the sample allocation com-\nmittee (SAC). The moratorium for Expedition 313 will extend 12 months from the \ncompletion of the expedition, which in the case of mission-specific platform expedi-\ntions is defined as the end of the Onshore Science Party.\nAll sample frequencies and sizes must be justified on a scientific basis and will depend \non core recovery, the full spectrum of other requests, and the expedition objectives. \nSome redundancy of measurement may be unavoidable, but minimizing the duplica-\ntion of measurements among the Science Party (which may include approved shore-\nbased collaborators) will be a factor in evaluating sample requests.\nBased on research requests (sample and data) submitted, the SAC will work with the \nScience Party to formulate a formal expedition-specific sampling and data sharing \nplan for shipboard and postcruise activities. This plan will be subject to modification \ndepending on the actual material\/data recovered and collaborations that may evolve \nbetween scientists before and during the expedition. Modifications to the sampling \nplan (i.e., new plans, research objectives, new collaborations, etc.) during the expedi-\ntion and postcruise moratorium require the approval of the SAC.\nSampling to acquire essential ephemeral data types, to describe and characterize the \nrecovered section, and to achieve essential sample preservation will be conducted \nduring the expedition. Although some sampling for individual scientist\u2019s postcruise \nresearch may be conducted during the offshore phase of the expedition, the majority \nof sampling may be deferred to the Onshore Science Party.\nThe SAC has agreed that the detailed review of sample requests will be deferred until \nafter the offshore operations are completed, so that sample requests can be reviewed \nwithin the context of the known core recovery and lithology.27\nExpedition 313 Scientific ProspectusFor Expedition 313, it is presumed that all drilled intervals will be unique; therefore, \nit is expected that all intervals will be designated as permanent archives. It should be \nstressed that the availability of archive halves for sampling depends on the presence \nof equivalent sedimentary sequences in adjacent holes that can be directly correlated \nand thereby identified as duplicate material. In the drilling of corals, similar to the \nsituation in hard rock environments, the paucity of replicate material may severely \nlimit the availability of nonpermanent archive-half material.\nThe SAC comprises:\nGregory Mountain: Co-Chief Scientist\nJean-No\u00ebl Proust: Co-Chief Scientist\nUrsula R\u00f6hl: ESO Curation Manager\/IODP Curator (or shipboard representative)\nDavid McInroy: ESO Staff Scientist28\nExpedition 313 Scientific ProspectusReferences\nAustin, J.A., Jr., Christie-Blick, N., Malone, M.J., et al., 1998.

The most pressing operational \nconstraint during the offshore phase is likely to be space, both for analysis and for ac-\ncommodation. The priority given to the respective offshore measurements are as fol-\nlows:\n1. Curation,\n2. Downhole logging,\n3. Multisensor core logging (MSCL),\n4. Inorganic geochemistry,\n5. Microbiology,\n6. Sedimentology, and\n7. In situ borehole temperature measurements.\nOffshore sampling and analysis\nPlease see www.marum.de\/en\/Offshore_core_curation_and_measurements.html\nin addition to the text below.\nCore curation\nThere will be a mobile core curation laboratory container on board the drilling plat-\nform, supervised by the Chief Curator. Curatorial personnel will also cover the oppo-\nsite shift. The curators will have delegated responsibility in the absence of the \nEuropean Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling (ECORD) Science Operator (ESO) \nCuration Manager and IODP Curator Dr. Ursula R\u00f6hl. A sufficient number of core \nstorage containers will be on the drilling platform. There will be no splitting of the \ncores at sea, as it will be more efficient to carry out most of the following scientific \nanalysis during the Onshore Science Party in Bremen.\nOffshore core flow\nFor details of the offshore core flow, see Figure AF1.49\nExpedition 313 Scientific ProspectusLithologic description\nCore catcher samples will be collected, split, and labeled and the working half handed \nover to the scientists in charge of sedimentologic description. If no core catcher is col-\nlected, a sample from the lower end of the section will be taken for analysis.\nInorganic geochemistry\nPore water samples (e.g., squeezers and rhizone moisture samplers) (Seefeld et al., \n2005) will be taken on a routine basis (every three cores if recovery is good). Pore wa-\nter should be extracted immediately from a core sample, and ephemeral properties \n(e.g., salinity, pH, alkalinity, and ammonia) will be analyzed immediately. Sample \nsplits for onshore analysis (e.g., cations, sulfide, and 13C) will be prepared and pre-\nserved offshore. Depending on the parameter, the interstitial water sample might be \nspecially treated in order to conserve it for later analyses.\nMicrobiology\nThe precise sampling strategy is defined by the requests of the science party microbi-\nologists, as IODP microbiology policies in relation to routine sampling for microbiol-\nogy are currently under discussion. Samples will be taken immediately in the field \nunder the most sterile possible conditions. Results will be interpreted with care as \ncontamination may occur during drilling and any microbial material found may not \nbe in situ. Fluorescent microspheres will be added to the drilling mud to assist evalu-\nation of contamination of samples for microbiology studies. Proper sample archiving \n(deep freezing) will be conducted.\nOffshore petrophysics measurements\nDownhole logging\nThe following is a generic list of minimum and additional logging tools that are in-\ntended to be run at each of the three proposed sites. The tools are listed by the forma-\ntion properties which they measure, and not by \u201coperator\u201d-based trademark names.\nHigh-priority suite:\n\u2022 Total through-pipe gamma ray.\n\u2022 Induction resistivity.\n\u2022 Sonic measurements.\n\u2022 Magnetic susceptibility.50\nExpedition 313 Scientific Prospectus\u2022 Open-hole spectral and total gamma ray.\n\u2022 Mechanical caliper.\n\u2022 Vertical Seismic Profile (VSP) logging.\n\u2022 In situ borehole temperature.\nLower-priority suite:\n\u2022 Hydrogeological properties.\n\u2022 Acoustic imaging (including acoustic caliper).\nCore logging\nCores will be logged on the drilling platform in a modified 20 ft container, housing a \nsingle MSCL track comprising one magnetic susceptibility loop, density, velocity, and \nresistivity sensors measuring gamma ray attenuation, magnetic susceptibility, electri-\ncal resistivity, and P-wave velocity. The single core-logger system will include a spares \nkit.\nOnshore sampling and analysis\nOnshore core flow\nFor details of the offshore core flow, see Figure AF2.\nLocation\nThe Onshore Science Party will be undertaken at the IODP Bremen Core Repository \nand Laboratory at the University of Bremen, with access to the laboratories at the \nMARUM-Center for Marine Environmental Sciences and the Department of Geosci-\nences.\nPlanned analysis and available facilities\nThe following facilities will be available for the Expedition Scientists at the Bremen \nIODP Core Repository (www.marum.de\/en\/Onshore_Science_Party_OSP.html). \nNote that it is not considered prudent to transport all these facilities to the drilling \nplatform:\n\u2022 Core splitting: an archive half will be set aside as per IODP policy.\n\u2022 Core description: ESO will provide a system that is IODP standard.
