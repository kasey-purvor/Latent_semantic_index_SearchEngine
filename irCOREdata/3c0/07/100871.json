INTRODUCTION\nA. Si nanoparticles in SiO2\nDrastic changes in materials properties and performance\ntake place upon the reduction of size and dimensionality of\ncrystals and nanostructures. This has been the driving force\nin research and development of nanoscaled MOS \u0001metal-\noxide-semiconductor\u0002 devices used for memory storage\napplications.1,2 Investigations on silicon nanocrystals \u0001NCs\u0002\nin silica matrices3 have been motivated by the possibility of\nreplacing the original bulk-floating gate and applications4\nsuch as nanocrystal memory cells,5 photon converters, and\noptical amplifiers.6,7 The main expectations include longer\nretention, lower gate voltage, and lower power\nconsumption.8 In addition, the discontinuity between the\nnanocrystals can prevent lateral charge loss and can also re-\nsult in short writing times at lower voltages, as well as im-\nproved reliability.9,10 Both injection and retention of elec-\ntrons in these devices are very sensitive to the size,\ndistribution, interfaces, and electronic structure of the nano-\ncrystals. The appropriate combination of these parameters\nmay lead to a dramatic improvements in device\nperformances.11\nB. The Si2p-shift in elemental silicon\u2013\u2013Earlier studies\nThere is a significant number of studies on the Si \/SiO2\nsystem referring to planar or curved interfaces \u0001particles in\nan oxide matrix\u0002, using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy\n\u0001XPS\u0002 data. The majority of them was focused on the posi-\ntion and energy shift of the Si2p\n0 peak \u0001where Si0 is Si in the\nelemental state\u0002.8,12\u201315 Studies of the planar SiO2 \/Si\u0001100\u0002 in-\nterface attributed the shift either to final state relaxation\neffects13 or to enhanced differential charging by application\nof a negative bias to the substrate.9 Sun et al.14 concluded\nthat the shift is a result of an enlargement of the band gap\ndue to surface imperfections at the Si nanocrystal-oxide in-\nterface. In a comprehensive paper from Iwata and Ishizaka12\non planar SiO2 \/Si interfaces, the shift was interpreted as a\nresult of charging that was dependent on x-ray intensity,\ntime, and sample thickness. They briefly mentioned that Au-\nger parameters are independent of charging, without showing\nany implicit data. In a recent study, Dane et al.16 ascribed the\nshift in the Si2p\n0 binding energy of Si nanoclusters to relax-\nation energy differences measured by the final state Auger\nparameter.\nC. XPS chemical shift, the Auger parameter, and\nchemical state diagrams\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy \u0001XPS\u0002 is commonly\nused as a surface analysis technique to characterize chemical\nstates of surfaces and interfaces. It is also frequently used for\nstudying the electronic structure of materials. Interpretations\nof XPS spectra are often based on shifts of peak positions\nand Auger parameters.17,18 The peak shift between two dif-\nferent chemical environments is known as a chemical shift\nand is defined as the binding energy difference \u0001\u0001EB\u0002 be-\ntween atoms bonded to different chemical species, e.g., el-\nemental Si and SiO2 \u0001EB Si4+\u2013EB Si0\u0002. However, the deter-\nmination of chemical shifts depends on reliable\nmeasurements of XPS peak positions, which in turn are sen-\nsitive to energy referencing issues. Additional difficulties\narise when measurements are performed on different samples\nor spectrometers and\/or by using different experimental set-\nups. Interpretations of the chemical shift are often compli-\ncated by differential charging when the sample is partially\n\u0001semi\u0002conducting and partially insulating.

In\nthe above formulas \u0001V reflects initial state changes in the\natomic potential arising from changes in valence electron\ncharge and\/or Coulomb interactions at the emission site. The\nterm \u0001\u0002 expresses changes in the work function and \u0001R\nrefers to final state changes associated with relaxation\/core\nhole screening energy.\nThe use of the Auger parameter \u0001\u0003\u0002, as defined by Eq.\n\u00013\u0002, eliminates energy referencing problems,19\n\u0003 = EB + EK. \u00013\u0002\nThe combination of Eqs. \u00011\u0002\u2013\u00013\u0002 leads to two different Auger\nparameter expressions reflecting either initial or final state\neffects; the initial17 \u0001\u0001\u0004\u0002 and final state20,21 \u0001\u0001\u0003\u0002 Auger pa-\nrameter, respectively,\n\u0001\u0003 = \u0001EB + \u0001EK = 2\u0001R \u00014\u0002\nand\n\u0001\u0004 = 3\u0001EB + \u0001EK = 2\u0001\u0001V + \u0001\u0002\u0002 . \u00015\u0002\nThe final state Auger parameter \u0001\u0003\u0002, which is free of energy\nreferencing problems, measures reliably the response of the\nsystem to the core hole electron screening.22,23 The initial\nstate Auger parameter is not completely independent of en-\nergy referencing due to the triple weighting of the binding\nenergy \u0001EB\u0002 in its definition.\nVery often, chemical state or Wagner diagrams are em-\nployed to facilitate visualization and subsequent interpreta-\ntion of the \u0001EB and \u0001EK values.19,24 In the case of, e.g., Si,\nsuch a diagram is constructed by plotting the binding energy\nof the Si2p peak against the kinetic energy of the SiKLL peak.\nThe Auger kinetic energy is on the ordinate and the photo-\nelectron binding energy is on the abscissa oriented in the\nnegative direction. The Auger parameters are then expressed\nby the linear relationship EK \u0001Auger peak\u0002 versus EB \u0001photo-\nemission peak\u0002 and lie on the straight lines with slope +1\n\u0001final state \u0003\u0002 and +3 \u0001initial state\u0004\u0002.24 This means that all\npoints lying on each line correspond to the same Auger pa-\nrameter value.\nDue to the variety of results and explanations concerning\nthe Si 2p shift \u0001see Sec. I B above\u0002, we attempt a detailed\nstudy of the mechanisms resulting in the Si 2p shift using\nphotoelectron spectroscopy data in the form of the SiKLL-Si2p\nAuger parameter and chemical state \u0001Wagner\u0002 plots, high-\nresolution transmission electron microscopy \u0001HRTEM\u0002, and\nelectron energy loss spectroscopy \u0001EELS\u0002. EELS is a useful\ntool in studying the electronic structure of nanostructural fea-\ntures of materials. Changes in the Si plasmon peak energy\n\u0001due to valence electron vibrations\u0002 have been previously\nattributed to changes in quantum confinement and\/or changes\nin the energy band gap.25\nII. MATERIALS AND METHODS\nThe samples were produced by growing a 3 nm layer of\nSiO2 on a p-type silicon substrate by rapid thermal oxidation\n\u0001RTO\u0002 at 1000 \u00b0C for 6 s. Prior to growing the RTO layer\nthe wafers were cleaned using a RCA \u0001Radio Corporation of\nAmerica\u0002 standard procedure for removing contaminants,\nfollowed by immersion in a 10% HF solution to remove the\nnative oxide. A 10 nm layer of silicon rich oxide was then\nsputtered from a SiO2:Si composite target onto the\nRTO-SiO2 and subsequently heat-treated in N2 atmosphere at\n1000\u22121100 \u00b0C for 30\u201360 min. Different percentages of\nsputtered material area coverage were achieved \u0001Si:SiO2\n=6,8 ,17,42,50,60,70%\u0002, yielding different silicon super-\nsaturation levels in the oxide. Table I gives information on\nthe samples studied, their Si content, and the applied heating\nduration and temperature. Cross-sectional TEM samples\nwere prepared by ion-milling using a Gatan precision ion\npolishing system with a 5 kV gun voltage.\nThe Si nanoparticles \u0001in crystalline and amorphous state\u0002\nwere observed by HRTEM and\/or by energy filtered TEM-\nspectral imaging \u0001EFTEM-SI\u0002 of the plasmon peak. HRTEM\nwas performed with a 300 keV JEOL JEM-3100FEF TEM\nequipped with an Omega imaging filter. For EELS, a 200\nkeV JEOL 2010F TEM with a Gatan imaging filter and de-\ntector was used. Energy filtered images were acquired by\nfiltering the plasmon peak of silicon \u000116.8 eV\u0002 with an en-\nergy slit of 2 eV. XPS was performed using a VG Scientific\nESCALAB MkII fitted with a Thermo Electron Corporation\nAlpha 110 electron energy analyzer, with nonmonochromatic\nAl K\u0003 radiation on plan-view samples at a take-off angle of\n45\u00b0. Survey scans and high-resolution spectra were acquired\nusing pass energies of 100 and 20 eV, respectively. Non-\nmonochromatic radiation was employed as it is the Brems-\nTABLE I.

The spectra were peak fitted using CASA XPS\n\u0001Ref. 28\u0002 after subtraction of a Shirley-type background. The\nFWHM values used for fitting the various components of the\nSi2p peak Si, Si2O, SiO, Si2O3, and SiO2 were 1.4, 1.6, 1.9,\n1.9, and 2.0\u20132.3 eV, respectively.\nIII. RESULTS\nA. Crystalline and amorphous Si nanoclusters\nSamples with different area percentages of Si:SiO2 have\nbeen systematically studied with HRTEM and energy filtered\nTEM \u0001EFTEM\u0002 in order to relate the volume fraction, size,\nand structure of nanocrystals to processing conditions. The\nresults will be presented elsewhere.29 However, the main\nfindings are briefly summarized in the following two sen-\ntences in order to facilitate the discussion in the present\nwork. HRTEM and EFTEM imaging showed the presence of\nnanocrystals 3\u20138 nm in size in samples with a silicon frac-\ntion of 50% and higher \u0001see also Fig. 1\u0002. Below 50% Si,\namorphous nanoclusters of 3\u20136 nm were found.\nB. Chemical states present in the samples\nXPS was utilized to identify the oxidation states of Si,\ndetect the amount of elemental Si present in SiO2, possibly\nas nanocrystals, and relate the shifts in core levels to Si con-\ncentration, nanocluster formation, and size. Five oxidation\nstates are reported to be present in Si \/SiO2 systems, corre-\nsponding to the five chemical states Si0, Si2O, SiO, Si2O3,\nand SiO2.8,12,30 Figure 2 shows the Si2p and SiKLL peaks of\nthree as-grown \u0001A.G.\u0002 samples with different Si content\nshowing the different chemical states present. The three extra\npeaks at 1610.9, 1608.7, and 1607.8 eV in the SiKLL spectra\nare plasmon peaks of the Si0, Si+, and Si2+ states and their\noptimized peak fitting.31,32 The measured final state Auger\nparameters \u0001\u0003\u0002 of Si0 \u0003EB\u0001Siref\n0 \u0002=99.5 eV\u0004 and Si4+\n\u0003EB\u0001Siref\n+4\u0002=103.6 eV\u0004 were 1715.4 and 1711.2 eV, respec-\ntively, in agreement with the literature values of 1715.7 \u0001Ref.\n33\u0002 for Si0 and 1711.7 eV \u0001Ref. 34\u0002 for Si4+.\nDuring heat treatment of the as-grown samples, the sub-\noxides thermally decomposed to SiO2 and Si0 nanoclusters.\nIt is clear from Fig. 3 that annealing decreased the Si3+-,\nSi2+-, Si+-, and Si0 - content, and increased that of Si4+. The\nreduction in intensity of the Si0 peak may be attributed to\noxidation due to residual oxygen in the nitrogen\natmosphere.8 Comparison of the as-grown sample with the\nsample annealed at 1100 \u00b0C for 30 min showed that anneal-\ning shifted the Si2p\n0 peak position to a lower binding energy\nat 0.2 eV \u0001\u00050.1\u0002. This decrease in binding energy between\nthe as-grown sample and the heat-treated sample with a sili-\ncon fraction of 70% is also observed in samples with 50 and\n60% silicon.\nC. Chemical shifts and nanoparticle size\nTable II shows that the annealed sample with the highest\nSi fraction \u000170%\u0002 contained 2.8\u00050.1 at % of suboxide,\nwhile the annealed sample with the lowest Si content \u000128%\u0002\nFIG. 1.

Phys. 103, 024308 \u00022008\u0001\nDownloaded 11 May 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/jap\/copyright.jsp\nhad the highest amount of suboxides \u00015.3\u00050.1 at %\u0002.\nTherefore, it seems that the amount of suboxide increases\nwith decreasing Si content and nanocluster size. This is prob-\nably an indication of the suboxide being located at the Si\nnanocluster\/silica interface, created by the Si ions not fully\nprecipitated into the Si nanoclusters.36\u201338\nThe Si 2p spectra in Fig. 4 \u0001normalized for the same Si4+\nposition\u0002 show differences in the chemical shift \u0001Si4+-Si0\u0002\nbetween samples with different fraction of Si \u0001see also Table\nII\u0002. As-grown samples \u0001see also Fig. 2\u0002 and annealed samples\nwith a Si fraction of 50% and above showed chemical shifts\nof 4.1 and 4.3\u00050.1 eV, respectively. Samples with a lower\nfraction of Si contained amorphous Si clusters29 and showed\nan increased chemical shift, while the measured shift for bulk\nSi \u0001Si substrate revealed after 2\u20133 min of Ar etching\u0002 was 4.6\neV. These results illustrate a dependence of the shift on\nwhether or not the samples contain amorphous or crystalline\nnanoclusters, and also an increase of the shift with decreas-\ning amorphous nanoclusters size.\nD. Initial state effects\nBinding energy shifts between two different chemical\nenvironments contain initial state contributions due to the\ndependence of the potential on the local environment. They\nare also influenced by final state variations expressed as the\nrelaxation energy change arising from the response of the\nlocal atomic electronic structure to the screening of the core\nhole. In order to address initial state variations we used the\ninitial state Auger parameter and the Si plasmon peak ener-\ngies; these values were compared to the measured differen-\ntial charging.\nThe difference in electrostatic charging between silicon\noxide and silicon nanocrystals\/clusters \u0001differential charging\u0002\nis defined as14\n\u0003EB\u0001Si4+\u0002 \u2212 EB\u0001Siref\n4+\u0002\u0004 \u2212 \u0003EB\u0001Si0\u0002 \u2212 EB\u0001Siref\n0 \u0002\u0004 , \u00016\u0002\nwhere EB\u0001Si4+\u0002 is the Si2p binding energy for SiO2, EB\u0001Si0\u0002 is\nthe Si2p binding energy for pure Si, and EB\u0001Siref\n4+\u0002 and\nEB\u0001Siref\n0 \u0002 are the corresponding reference values.39 Differ-\nences in Si2p peak positions without corrections for electro-\nstatic charging together with reference values for Si2p\n4+ and\nSi2p\n0 are shown in Table II.40 The samples containing nano-\ncrystals \u0001Si fraction of 50% and above\u0002 showed the smallest\ndifferential charging \u00010.1 eV\u0002, while the sample containing\namorphous nanoclusters \u0001with the lowest Si concentration\u0002\nexhibited the highest one \u00011.2 eV\u0002. Taking into account the\nresults shown in Sec. III C, the differential charging in-\ncreases with increasing chemical shift.

The maximum in the plasmon energy peak\nfor pure bulk Si and the Si nanocrystals in the 70 and 60%\nsamples were 17.2, 18.4, and 18.8 eV, respectively. A 1.2\u20131.6\neV difference in plasmon energy between pure Si \u0001substrate\u0002\nand the Si nanocrystals was therefore observed.

Final state effects\nFinal state effects express properties of the short-lived,\nhighly excited core hole states and are related to screening\nefficiency.42 The final state Auger parameter \u0001\u0003\u0002 provides an\nestimate of the relaxation\/screening energy in the presence of\ncore holes \u0003see Eq. \u00014\u0002\u0004. A high \u0003 value indicates a higher\nrelaxation energy or improved screening efficiency. Final\nstate Auger parameter values are shown in Table III and plot-\nted in the Wagner diagram shown in Fig. 6 as lines with\nslope +1.\nThe variations in \u0003 between the different samples are\nsmaller than in \u0004. The only significant difference in \u0003 is\nbetween bulk Si \u0001substrate and literature27 value of pure Si\u0002\nand the nanoclusters \u0001SiNC\n0 \u0002, as well as between bulk Si\n\u0001Sibulk\n0 \u0002 and the silicon in the nonannealed samples \u0001SiAG\n0 \u0002.\nBulk silicon has the highest \u0003 value \u00011716.2\u00050.1 eV\u0002, in\nagreement with the literature value for pure silicon, while\nSiAG\n0 has the lowest Auger parameter \u00011715.4\u00050.1 eV\u0002. The\nabove results indicate that electronic screening of core holes\nincreases in the order SiAG\n0 \u0006SiNC\n0 \u0006Sibulk\n0\n.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nA. Initial state effects\nContrary to \u0003, the Auger parameter \u0004 is not completely\nindependent of energy referencing. Therefore, \u0004 can be po-\ntentially influenced by work function differences. The work\nfunction is defined as the work necessary to remove a Fermi-\nlevel \u0001EF\u0002 electron from the crystal to infinity.\n43,44 EF is the\nlevel at which the electrons and protons are balanced, half-\nway between the valence and conduction bands in intrinsic\nsemiconductors, and it shifts either toward the conduction\nband, or toward the valence band depending on doping, n-\nand p type, respectively.\nSince the experiments were performed using the same\nspectrometer, we assume that the effect of the spectrometer\nwork function on the binding energy \u0001\u0001EB\u0002 should be negli-\ngible. Therefore, it can only be differences in the material\nwork function that can contribute to \u0001EB. An increase in\nenergy band gap Eg could shift EF upwards toward the\nvacuum level, thus reducing the work function \u0001\u0002\u0002. This\nwould be detectable via an increase in the EK of the Si2p\n0\nelectrons, an equivalent reduction in EB, and a subsequent\nincrease in the chemical shift. An increase in valence charge\ncould also lift up the EF and therefore reduce \u0002.\nAccording to the suggested interpretation, plasmon ener-\ngies and Auger parameter values provided by EELS and\nXPS, respectively, indicate an increase in valence electron\ndensity and\/or Eg in the amorphous nanoclusters compared to\nbulk silicon. Either one or both of the two reasons \u0001increased\nelectron density, larger Eg\u0002 lift the EF and subsequently re-\nduce \u0002 of the nanocrystals, influencing thus \u0001lowering\u0002 the\nSi2p\n0 binding energy and increasing the chemical shift.\nPure silicon \u0001Si0\u0002 supersaturated in SiO2 prior to anneal-\ning shows exactly the opposite behavior in Si2p\n0 peak shifts,\nchemical shift, and differential charging as the amorphous\nnanoclusters \u0001see Table II\u0002. Also, the initial state Auger pa-\nrameter of Si0 in SiO2 prior to annealing exhibits only a\nsmall negative shift compared to the substrate \u0001see Table III\u0002.\nThis implies that the ground state \u0001Si0\u0002 of silicon in SiO2 is\n\u201cmore positively charged\u201d prior to annealing and becomes\n\u201cmore negatively charged\u201d upon annealing during formation\nof amorphous and crystalline nanoclusters. The positive shift\n\u0001\u0001V\u0002 of the atomic potential of Si0 in the as-grown samples\n\u0001compared to Sibulk\n0 \u0002 may be attributed to the need of Si to\nshare electrons with the more electronegative surrounding\noxygen atoms. When surrounded by the less electronegative\nSi atoms \u0001Si0 atomic environment in nanocrystals\u0002, the elec-\ntrons are located closer to the Si atom.\nB. Final state effects\nThe increase in band gap would also lead to a reduction\nin the screening efficiency of the conduction electrons and\nthis will be detected as a decrease in \u0003. Small nanocrystals\nhave an increased band gap compared to both bulk silicon\nand larger nanocrystals,45\u201347 and this is reflected in \u0003 acquir-\ning lower values.48 Amorphous Si has a higher band gap\n\u00011.6\u20131.7 eV, Refs. 49 and 50\u0002 than crystalline Si \u00011.2 eV\u0002.\nWe recall that amorphous nanoclusters also have a larger\ndifference in chemical shift, differential charging, and initial\nstate Auger parameter, compared to the nanocrystals and the\nsubstrate. The final state Auger parameter \u0003 shows only\nsmall differences between crystalline bulk Si and Si nano-\nclusters \u0001both crystalline and amorphous\u0002, but there is no\nsignificant difference between the differently sized amor-\nphous or crystalline nanoclusters; therefore, it seems that fi-\nnal state effects influence the Si2p binding energy less than\ninitial state effects \u0001see Table III\u0002. The \u0003 for silicon in both\nthe as-grown and postannealed conditions is lower than that\nin bulk silicon or reference Si, implying a reduced core hole\nscreening. It is known that screening in Si has a nonlocal\ncharacter.51 Therefore, the delocalized nature of electron\nscreening in combination with the nonconducting silicon ox-\nide environment would be expected to influence the screen-\ning of core holes in the nanoclusters even in the presence of\nan increased valence electron density.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nWe used the Auger parameter to separate initial and final\nstate effects in the Si2p\n0 shift of Si crystalline and amorphous\nnanoclusters dispersed in SiO2. The Si2p\n0 position in the nano-\ncrystals relative to Si2p\n4+ \u0001chemical shift\u0002 is determined by\ninitial state rather than final state effects. The negative charge\non the Si0 sites in nanoclusters and the positive on the Si0\nsites in the supersaturated \u0001with Si\u0002 silica, as indicated by the\ninitial state Auger parameter, dominate on both differential\ncharging and chemical shifts. \u0001\u0003 shows that the electron\nscreening of core holes in Si is superior when Si is clustered\nand not dispersed in SiO2. The core hole screening of Si in\nthe nanoclusters is inferior to that in bulk Si and this is\npresumably due to its nonlocal character in Si.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nFinancial support by FUNMAT-UiO, the University of\nOslo, and Kristine Bonnevie\u2019s traveling scholarship is grate-\nfully acknowledged.
