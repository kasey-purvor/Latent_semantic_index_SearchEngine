INTRODUCTION\nBogomolny-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) monopoles\nhave long been of considerable interest (for reviews, see\nRefs. [1,2]), and recently have found a new interpretation\nin the context of D-branes. This D-brane connection is\npartly responsible for a particular interest in periodic as-\nsemblages of monopoles. For example, there have been\nstudies of monopole chains [3], where the underlying\ntheory (such as the Nahm transform) is well-developed.\nHowever, for monopole sheets or walls, where the fields\nare doubly-periodic, much less is known.\nIt has been suggested [4,5] that the (essentially Abelian)\nhomogeneous solution on R3 may be viewed as a mono-\npole sheet, and there is a sense in which such an interpre-\ntation is meaningful. If, however, one constructs a sheet of\nDirac monopoles, as a double series, then the resulting field\nlooks rather different. The purpose of this note is to present\nnumerical evidence for the existence of an SU(2) mono-\npole sheet which is a smoothed-out version of the Dirac\nsheet. As we shall see, it resembles a domain wall between\na vacuum region and a region of homogeneous phase with\nconstant energy density.\nII. THE U(1) CASE: SHEET OF DIRAC\nMONOPOLES\nLet r \u0002 \u0003x; y; z\u0004 denote the usual position vector in R3,\nand let P be the square lattice in the xy-plane consisting of\npoints of the form r \u0002 \u0003j; k; 0\u0004, with j; k 2 Z. Suppose we\nplace a unit-charge Dirac monopole at each site of this\nlattice. The resulting magnetic field is, at least formally,\n B \u0003x; y; z\u0004 \u0002 1\n2\nX\nj;k2Z\n\u0003x\u0001 j; y\u0001 k; z\u0004=r3jk; (1)\nwhere r2jk \u0002 \u0003x\u0001 j\u00042 \u0005 \u0003y\u0001 k\u00042 \u0005 z2. The component Bz\nis a positive series which converges absolutely, and the\nother two components Bx and By are conditionally con-\nvergent (except, of course, at the points of P, where B is\nsingular). For fixed \u0003x; y\u0004, we have B ! \u00030; 0;\u0006\u0001\u0004 as z !\n\u00061; this was checked by numerical summation of the\nseries, and can also be established by a rough analytic\napproximation.\nSimilarly, we may obtain a gauge potential A by taking a\ngauge potential for each monopole and summing these; for\nexample,\n A \u0003x; y; z\u0004 \u0002 X\nj;k2Z\n\u0003k\u0001 y; x\u0001 j; 0\u0004\n2rjk\u0003z\u0005 rjk\u0004 ; (2)\nwhich is valid in the region z > 0. The asymptotic behavior\nof (2) is A ! \u00012 \u0003\u0001y; x; 0\u0004 as z ! 1.\nIn general, if we have a doubly-periodic vector field B\nwhich is smooth for jzj \u0007 c, then we can define its charge\n\u0003N\u0001; N\u0005\u0004 by\n N\u0006 \u0002 12\u0001\nZ 1\n0\ndx\nZ 1\n0\ndyBz\u0003x; y;\u0006c\u0004; (3)\nby continuity, N\u0006 do not change if c is increased. If B is\ngenuinely a doubly-periodic magnetic field, in other words\nif its gauge potential is doubly-periodic up to a gauge\ntransformation, then N\u0001 and N\u0005 will both be integers:\nthis is the Dirac quantization condition for a magnetic field\non the torus T2. The field (1), in view of its asymptotic\nbehavior, clearly has charge \u0003\u0001 12 ; 12\u0004, and so it does not\nquite satisfy this quantization condition. (Of course, taking\nan array of monopoles of charge 2 would have the effect of\nmultiplying all the expressions by 2, and so this would give\na genuinely doubly-periodic magnetic field.)\nAnother example of a \u2018\u2018half-doubly-periodic\u2019\u2019 field is\nthe homogeneous solution\n B \u0003x; y; z\u0004 \u0002 \u00030; 0; \u0001\u0004; A\u0003x; y; z\u0004 \u0002 \u0001\n2\n\u0003\u0001y; x; 0\u0004; (4)\nwhich has charge is \u000312 ; 12\u0004. If we add Eq. (4) to Eq. (1), then\nwe obtain a doubly-periodic magnetic field of charge (0, 1),\nwith\n B !\n\u0001\n2\u0001 as z ! 1;\n0 as z ! \u00011: (5)\nThis is the prototype of our monopole sheet: it separates a\nvacuum region with energy density approximately zero\n(for z \b \u00011), from a region of homogeneous phase with\nenergy density approximately constant (for z \t 1).

THE SU(2) CASE: SETUP\nLet fAj\u0003x; y; z\u0004;\u0001\u0003x; y; z\u0004g denote an SU(2) Yang-Mills-\nHiggs field, and define Dj\u0001 :\u0002 @j\u0001\u0005 \nAj;\u0001\u000b, Bj :\u0002\n1\n2 \"jkl\u0003@kAl \u0001 @lAk \u0005 \nAk; Al\u000b\u0004, as usual. We impose the\nglobal conditions:\n(a) Aj and \u0001 are 2\f 2 anti-Hermitian trace-free matri-\nces, and are smooth on R3;\n(b) Aj and \u0001 are periodic in both x and y (actually\nperiodic, not merely up to a gauge transformation),\nwith unit periods.\nIn addition, we need boundary conditions as z ! \u00061, and\nthese can be formulated as follows. If the restriction \u0001c :\u0002\n\u0001jz\u0002c is nowhere-zero (as a function of x and y), then the\nnormalized Higgs field \u0001^c :\u0002 \u0001c=j\u0001cj is well-defined,\nand is a map from the torus T2 to the 2-sphere S2. Here\nj\u0001j2 :\u0002 \u0001 12 tr\u0003\u00012\u0004. So \u0001^c has a degree (winding number)\nNc 2 Z. If \u0001z is nowhere-zero for z \u0007 c, then by continu-\nity the degree Nz is independent of z, and is denoted N\u0005;\nsimilarly for N\u0001. The boundary condition, motivated by\nthe U(1) case, is:\n(c) Dx\u0001 ! 0 and Dy\u0001 ! 0 as z ! 1; if N\u0005 \u0001 0, then\nj\u0001j=z ! 2\u0001jN\u0005j, and jDz\u0001j is bounded, as z ! 1;\nif N\u0005 \u0002 0, then j\u0001j ! const and jDz\u0001j ! 0 as z !\n1; and similarly as z ! \u00011.\nWe say that such a field has charge \u0003\u0001N\u0001; N\u0005\u0004.\nFor fields satisfying conditions (a)\u2013(c), there is a topo-\nlogical lower bound on the energy. The derivation of this is\nanalogous to the one used for monopoles localized in R3.\nIn order to get finite energy, we need to restrict to a finite\ncylinder \u0001L \r z \r L; the condition (c) is adapted in the\nobvious way to become a condition at z \u0002 \u0006L. The energy\ndensity is\n E :\u0002 \u000112 tr\n\u0003Dj\u0001\u00042 \u0005 \u0003Bj\u00042\u000b: (6)\nThe first observation is that\n Nc \u0002 14\u0001\nZ\nz\u0002c\ntr\n\u0001^Bz\u000bdxdy; (7)\nwhich is a standard calculation [6]. The energy is\n EL :\u0002\nZ L\n\u0001L\ndz\nZ\ndxdyE\n\u0002 \u0001 1\n2\nZ\ntr\u0003Dj\u0001\u0005 Bj\u00042d3x\u0005\nZ\ntr\u0003Dj\u0001 \u000e Bj\u0004d3x:\nAssuming for simplicity that N\u0005 \u0007 0 \u0007 N\u0001, and using\nStokes\u2019s theorem, this leads to the inequality\n EL \u0007 8\u00012L\u0003N2\u0005 \u0005 N2\u0001\u0004; (8)\nwith equality if and only if the Bogomolny equations\n Dj\u0001 \u0002 \u0001Bj (9)\nare satisfied.\nThere is an exact solution of (9) representing a field of\ncharge (1, 1)\u2014in other words, with N\u0005 \u0002 1 \u0002 \u0001N\u0001. This\nis obtained [4,5] by embedding the homogeneous Abelian\nfield (4), multiplied by a factor of \u00012, into SU(2):\n \u0001 \u0002 2i\u0001z\u00023; Aj \u0002 i\u0001\u0003y;\u0001x; 0\u0004\u00023; (10)\nand then applying an SU(2) gauge transformation (which it\nis not hard to write down explicitly), in order to make the\nfields periodic. The energy density of Eq. (10) is easily read\noff, and is E \u0002 8\u00012; so the Bogomolny bound (8) is\nsaturated, as expected.\nIV. THE SU(2) CASE: NUMERICAL SOLUTION\nThe problem is to investigate whether there is a SU(2)\nsolution of the Bogomolny Eqs. (9) with charge (0, 1)\u2014\nand to see what it looks like. No existence theorem is\ncurrently available, and the best that can be done here is\nto use a numerical approach. The idea is to discretize the\nsystem as a lattice gauge theory, and to minimize the\nenergy EL numerically. A minimum which saturates the\nlower bound (8), in other words with EL \u0002 8\u00012L, should\nthen be a solution.\nSo we replace R3, or rather the region \u00030; 1\u000b \f \u00030; 1\u000b \f\n\n\u0001L; L\u000b, with a cubic M\fM\f \u00032LM\u0005 1\u0004 lattice \u0002, so\nthe lattice spacing is h \u0002 1=M. The gauge potential is\nrepresented, in the standard way, by assigning an element\nA of SU(2) to each link of \u0002; the curvature is then an\nelement B of SU(2) associated with each face. We repre-\nsent the Higgs field by assigning an element \u0003 of SU(2) to\neach site of \u0002; the covariant derivatives D\u0003 are then\nelements of SU(2) associated with each link. The energy\nis given by the \u2018\u2018Wilson action\u2019\u2019\n EL \u0002 2h\nX\nfaces\n\u00031\u0001 trB\u0004 \u0005 2\nh\nX\nlinks\n\u00031\u0001 trD\u0003\u0004; (11)\nwhich is gauge-invariant on the lattice.\nThe boundary conditions, which are also gauge-\ninvariant, are as follows:\n(i) at z \u0002 L, we impose 12 tr\u0003 \u0002 cos\u00032\u0001hL\u0004;\n(ii) at z \u0002 \u0001L, we impose B \u0002 1.\nThese correspond, respectively, to the conditions j\u0001j \u0002\n2\u0001L at z \u0002 L, and B \u0002 0 at z \u0002 \u0001L, in the continuum\nversion.\nThe initial configuration was constructed by starting\nwith the lattice version of the homogeneous solution,\nnamely\nR.

This\nwas done for various values of M (or equivalently h) and L.\nFor M \u0007 12, the results are already of high accuracy, in the\nsense that the value of EL at its minimum is within 0.5% of\nthe Bogomolny bound, and it changes by less than that\namount if M is increased. The graphs in Fig. 1 depict the\nminimum-energy configuration with M \u0002 14 (so the lat-\ntice spacing is h \u0002 0:071), and L \u0002 2. Its lattice energy is\nEL \u0002 0:9997\f 8\u00012L. The upper-left-hand graph shows\nthe topological charge (winding number) N of \u0001jz, as a\nfunction of z; in particular, we see that the solution does\nindeed have charge (0, 1). The norm of the Higgs field \u0001\n(at x \u0002 y \u0002 1, and as a function of z) is shown in the upper-\nright-hand graph; as expected, it approaches a constant\nvalue as z ! \u00011, and depends linearly on z as z ! 1.\nThe lower-left-hand graph shows the energy density E (or\nrather its lattice version) summed over x and y, as a\nfunction of z. We see that the energy density tends to\nzero as z ! \u00011, approaches a constant value as z ! 1,\nand is peaked at z \u000f 0:4. Finally, the lower-right-hand\nsubfigure plots the energy density at z \u0002 0:4, as a function\nof x and y. For jzj \u0007 1, the corresponding energy plots are\nessentially constant in x and y, but at the location of the\nmonopole sheet (which here is at z \u000f 0:4) we see the\nindividual monopoles (one in each fundamental cell of\nthe lattice, of which four are shown).\nV. CONCLUDING REMARKS AND OPEN\nQUESTIONS\nIt is straightforward to change the x, y-periods by scal-\ning: in fact, if f\u0001; Ajg is a solution with unit periods in x\nand y, then f ~\u0001\u0003r\u0004 :\u0002 \u0004\u0001\u0003r=\u0004\u0004; ~Aj\u0003r\u0004 :\u0002 \u0004Aj\u0003r=\u0004\u0004g is a\nsolution with periods \u0004. More generally, it should be\npossible (although this has not been investigated) to con-\nstruct analogous solutions in which the monopole sheet has\na different lattice structure, for example, hexagonal.\n(Compare the case of the Skyrme system, where a hexago-\nnal lattice is slightly more energetically favorable than a\nsquare lattice [1,7].)\nIf one takes the gauge group to be SO(3) rather than\nSU(2), then the topological classification of doubly-\nperiodic monopoles has an additional feature, since\nSO(3) bundles over the torus T2 are not necessarily triv-\nial\u2014they are classified by Z2. Essentially, the conse-\nquence is that the charges \u0003N\u0001; N\u0005\u0004 of SO(3) monopole\nsheets need not be integers, but may be half-integers. The\nsimplest example [5] is the homogeneous solution of\ncharge \u000312 ; 12\u0004, analogous to Eq. (11), namely\n \u0001\u00030\u0004 \u0002 i\u0001z\u00023; A\u00030\u0004j \u0002 12i\u0001\u0003y;\u0001x; 0\u0004\u00023; (12)\nwhich, in effect, lives on a nontrivial SO(3) bundle over\nT2 \f R. There should exist an SO(3) domain wall solution\nof charge \u00030; 12\u0004 which is analogous to the charge (0, 1)\nsolution. More generally, there should exist sheets of\ncharge \u0003p=2; q=2\u0004, where p; q 2 Z. If p and q are distinct,\nthen such a solution represents a wall between two distinct\nhomogeneous phases; one of these could be the vacuum, if\nthe corresponding charge is zero.\nThe only \u2018\u2018visible\u2019\u2019 parameters in the numerical solution\npresented above are those corresponding to translations in\nx, y, and z. (The position of the sheet, which turned out to\nbe at z \u000f 0:4, is in effect set by the boundary condition at\nz \u0002 L: in fact, by the fixed value of j\u0001j at z \u0002 L.) Whether\nthere are additional moduli is not known. For the homoge-\nneous solutions, the moduli can be computed explicitly\n[4,5]: the solutions of charge \u0003p=2; p=2\u0004, with p 2 Z,\ndepend on 4p parameters; and the perturbations (normal-\nizable zero-modes) can be written down explicitly in terms\nof theta-functions. (Only the p \u0002 1 case was presented in\n[5], but its generalization to p \u0007 2 is straightforward.) This\nsuggests that there might also be additional moduli in the\ngeneral case of charge \u0003p=2; q=2\u0004.\nThe main tool in the analysis of BPS monopoles has\nbeen the Nahm transform [8,9].

Charge, Higgs field, and energy density\nof SU(2) monopole sheet.\nMONOPOLE WALL PHYSICAL REVIEW D 75, 021701(R) (2007)\nRAPID COMMUNICATIONS\n021701-3\nfavor of this comes from the class of homogeneous solu-\ntions: the U(1) case was described in [5], and the SU(2)\ncase is similar.\nSolutions (with prescribed singularities) of the\nBogomolny equations on C\f I, where C is a Riemann\nsurface and I is an interval, crop up in the area of super-\nsymmetric gauge theory and branes (see, for example,\nRef. [11]). The context of the present paper is rather differ-\nent, but the solutions described here could be reinterpreted\nin D-brane language.\nThere are many similarities between BPS monoples and\nSkyrmions (see, for example, Ref. [12]). In the Skyrme\nsystem, there is a wall-like solution analogous to a gra-\nphene sheet, and one may view fullerenelike Skyrmions as\nbeing shells constructed from such sheets [7]; in fact, the\nsheet separates a region of \u2018\u2018Skyrmion core\u2018\u2018 from the\nregion outside the Skyrmion. The monopole sheet de-\nscribed above appears at first sight to be rather different\nin nature, since neither side of the wall corresponds to the\nfield outside a BPS monopole (which, of course, is that of a\nDirac monopole). It may, however, turn out to be relevant\nas the wall of a magnetic bag [13].\nTo summarize: we have constructed, numerically, a\nsolution of the Bogomolny equations representing a sheet\nof BPS monopoles: in general, it is a domain wall between\ntwo regions of constant energy density, either of which can\nbe a vacuum region. A purely-magnetic wall separating\nregions of different energy density would be unstable; but\nin the BPS system studied here, the pressure on the wall\nfrom the Higgs field is exactly opposite to that from the\nmagnetic field, and so there is no obvious instability.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by research grants \u2018\u2018Strongly\nCoupled Phenomena\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Classical Lattice Field\nTheory,\u2019\u2019 from the UK Particle Physics and Astronomy\nResearch Council.\n[1] N.
