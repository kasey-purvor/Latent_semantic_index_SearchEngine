Introduction\nHuman communication (from here on symbolic communication) is a key concept\nwithin sociological research and for many authors the scientific study of this process\nis of paramount importance to explain the emergence of social order. Most of the\nwork done by prominent sociologists such as Blumer [1], Habermas [5] and Luhmann\n[7] has been devoted to comprehending the relationship between social order and\nthe features of symbolic communication. Recently, Sawyer has claimed that a theory\nof social emergence needs an explicit understanding of symbolic communication [11,\n12]. We have made similar claims for the case of computational sociology in [10].\nComputational sociology [3] models social phenomena by using the ideas of emergent\ncomplex systems, although the very notion of emergence is a contentious element\nwithin the field. In order to overcome these quarrels, sociological theories of symbolic\ncommunication can be useful to computational sociology, since they give an account\nof the emergence of the social realm from the \u2018bottom up\u2019 as communication and\ndescribe the process by which society limits possible individual actions.\nIn this article we present a sociological framework that explains the emergence\n1\nMarch 17, 2010 17:47 WSPC\/INSTRUCTION FILE \u201dWhat did you say\u201d\n2 Marchione, Salgado and Gilbert\nof symbolic communication by considering two evolutionary constraints (Section 2).\nIn this explanation, the frequency with which agents refer to different topics over\ntime and the spatial limitations on reaching recipients are of importance. Then, we\ndescribe an agent-based simulation that considers some spatial features and repli-\ncates the evolutionary pressures discussed (Section 3). We present the simulation\nresults and discuss the implications for understanding the emergence and evolution\nof a shared lexicon among independent agents (Section 4). Finally, we present some\nconclusions (Section 5).\n2. Understanding Communication\n2.1. The Evolution of Communication\nFrom a sociological point of view, symbolic communication is the basic element of\nsocial order [6, 5]. Symbolic communication is an emergent order that involves at\nleast two agents: a speaker and a hearer. Analytically it emerges through a synthesis\nof three selections: the speaker selects some information from a range of possibilities;\nshe or he instantiates it through some signal or linguistic medium (utterance);\nthe hearer observes the speaker\u2019s conduct and understand or misunderstands this\nutterance and its informational content [6]. Of course, the hearer can accept or\nreject the information, but either way it might be said that the hearer understands\nthe speaker\u2019s proposal.\nRegardless of how counter-intuitive this might be, the emergence of symbolic\ncommunication is improbable. As Luhmann [7] argues, despite the fact that in\neveryday life communication is taken for granted, it must\u2014if it comes about\u2014\novercome some obstacles. We will focus on two of them: (1) the individuality of\nconsciousness and (2) the extension of communication beyond direct participantsa.\nThe first improbability is related with understanding; given that their bodies are\nseparate (and consequently they do not have access to the other\u2019s mind), it is\nunlikely that one person can understand the informational content or topic that\nanother person wants to communicate (i.e, what another personmeans). The second\nimprobability is related with the spatial limitations of communication in reaching\nrecipients; in other words, it is improbable that communication can get to more\npeople than are present in a given situation.\nHowever, regardless of these improbabilities, social order exists and we com-\nmunicate daily. This is because social evolution has overcome these improbabilities\nwith some mechanisms. The first improbability is solved by the emergence of cul-\ntural signs, like words, which make it more probable that individuals in interaction\n(and members of the same community) can understand each other. This is the case\nbecause both the individual using a cultural sign (the speaker) and the individ-\naThere is a third improbability related with the difficulty of ensuring that the hearer accepts\nand follows the communication\u2019s informative content presented by the speaker\u2019s utterances, even\nthough she understands it. In this paper, we will not discuss this improbability.\nMarch 17, 2010 17:47 WSPC\/INSTRUCTION FILE \u201dWhat did you say\u201d\n\u2018What did you say?\u2019 3\nual receiving it (the hearer) can identify the same topic. That is, cultural signs\nmake more probable that the \u2018hearer\u2019 understands the \u2018speaker\u2019, because they can,\nthrough equivalent signs, reinforce the impression that they are attending to equiv-\nalent topics.\nBut cultural signs per se are still strongly coupled with interactional contexts;\nthey require that the individuals that use them are near to each other because the\n\u2018hearer\u2019 must see or hear the sign used by the \u2018speaker\u2019 in order to distinguish\nits informational content. Consequently, there are important spatial constraints for\nthe use of cultural signs. Thus, the second improbability refers to the problem of\nthe limited range of communications. Dissemination media [7], such as writing,\nprinting and electronic broadcasting, contribute to expand communication beyond\nthe restrictive boundaries of interactional contexts (i.e., face to face interaction).\nIn more abstract (and metaphoric) terms, the extension of communication beyond\ndirect participants is a question of magnitude: how loud the speaker can \u2018utter\u2019 some\ncultural sign and consequently reach more recipients. To be sure, \u2018voice loudness\u2019\nhad no impact on the evolution of cultural signs. Rather, we are proposing the\nidea of \u2018loudness\u2019 might be (as we will see in section 3.2) a good operationalization\nto model the dissemination media\u2019s effect, that is, the capability of increasing the\nnumber of potential recipients one agent can reach in time and space.\n2.2. Different Communicative Strategies\nFrom the previous discussion we can state two general implications about the emer-\ngence and evolution of some symbolic communicative system. Firstly, in order to\nstabilise a cultural sign x over time, the number of times that individuals communi-\ncate about the same topic by using x must be crucial. Analytically, we can imagine a\npopulation where there are individuals that participate for longer in communicative\ninteractions about the same topic (i.e., they seldom change the topic) and individ-\nuals that participate in different communicative interactions about different topics\n(i.e., they often change the topic). Secondly, because cultural signs are so tied to\nthe restrictions in space (and time) of interactional orders, which are by definition\nephemeral (see [4]), the agents\u2019 capability to reach more recipients must have im-\nportant consequences for the generalization and stabilization of cultural signs over\ntime. Analytically, we can imagine a population of individuals whose utterances are\n\u2018loud\u2019 (i.e., they can reach many recipients) and individuals whose utterance are\n\u2018soft\u2019 (i.e., they can reach few recipients). These two aspects might act as evolution-\nary pressures for the emergence of symbolic communication.\nAs we can see in Figure 1, symbolic communication can be characterized by\nthe combination of two dimensions, namely: 1) the frequency of changing the topic\n(FCT) and 2) the capability of reaching recipients (CRR). Both dimensions are\nfeatures of agents that have consequences for the emergence of symbolic communi-\ncation. The first dimension is related to the rate that an agent can change the topic\nof her or his communication; agents in interaction can quickly or slowly vary the\nMarch 17, 2010 17:47 WSPC\/INSTRUCTION FILE \u201dWhat did you say\u201d\n4 Marchione, Salgado and Gilbert\ntopic of communication over time and, consequently, the number of times they refer\nto the topic by using some cultural sign. The second dimension is related to the\n\u2018loudness\u2019 of the agent\u2019s voice, that is, the capacity to reach more recipients beyond\nthe direct participants in the interaction. The combination of these two dimensions\nproduces four types of communicative strategies, as shown in Figure 1.\nFig. 1. Four Paradigmatic Communicative Strategies.\nThis framework poses some interesting research questions. In this article, we\nwant to study one of them. If the capability of reaching recipients and the frequency\nof changing the topic are as important for the emergence of symbolic communication\nas sociological theory argues, then those dimensions must have some impact on\nthe agents\u2019 ability to produce and disseminate their own cultural signs across the\npopulation. Specifically, there might be one communicative strategy that is more\nadvantageous for spreading cultural signs than others.\n3. The Simulation\nIn order to study the previous theoretical framework we have developed an agent-\nbased simulation taking into account some spatial characteristics. The aim of this\nsimulation is to clarify to what extent the two dimensions affect the emergence and\nevolution of symbolic communication. We want to understand whether those dimen-\nsions, and specifically the communicative strategies that the combination of them\nproduce, have some effect on the agents\u2019 ability to generalise their own cultural signs.\nThis simulation is based on existing research about the emergence of lexicons [8,\n13\u201317]. According to Vogt and Coummans\u2019 [16] categorization, the communicative\nMarch 17, 2010 17:47 WSPC\/INSTRUCTION FILE \u201dWhat did you say\u201d\n\u2018What did you say?\u2019 5\ninteractions between agents in our simulation resemble the Observational Game, in\nwhich the agents establish joint attention over one single object and then communi-\ncate about it. However, we make some important modifications to the observational\ngame: (1) the agents are embodied in a spatial configuration, (2) they have different\nbehaviours, and (3) communicative interactions can involve more than two agents.\nBy convention, in conformity with previous research in the area, the communica-\ntive system will be called a shared lexicon, a set of associations among meanings and\ncultural signs called words. A lexicon is shared by the whole population of agents\nat the end of the simulation. Our interest is in understanding which communicative\nstrategy is best at allowing a group of agents to influence the shared lexicon. As a\nmeasure of success in disseminating words, we use the number of words that each\ncommunicative strategy, represented by a group of agents endowed with that strat-\negy, inserts into the shared lexicon. Let us now define formally the main components\nof the model.\n3.1. Agent behaviour and Objects\nLet there be a set of agents A = {a1, ..., an} and a set of objects O = {o1, ..., on}\nplaced within the world. The agent population is split into four groups gi, where\ni \u2208 {1, 2, 3, 4}. \u2200a : a \u2208 A, a is assumed to see objects o \u2208 O; produce utterances\nua consisting of a word w; hear the utterances un that other agents produce; and\nrandomly move across the world.\nAn agent\u2019s utterance ua have an audibility radius ra. An agent\u2019s speed of move-\nment is measured by the number of steps it takes in each simulation tick, the step\nlength sa. \u2200o : o \u2208 O, o is assumed to have a fixed visibility area v (i.e., all the\nobjects have the same visibility area and the grid was built in such a way that the\nvisibility areas do not overlap). Both r and s can vary between the agents according\nto their group membership.\nIn this model, the audibility radius ra is our operationalization of the commu-\nnicational dimension Capability of Reaching Recipients (CRR), because the larger\nan agent\u2019s audibility radius, the more recipients it can reach with its utterances.\nThe second operationalization is less obvious. In this model, step length s is our\noperationalization of the communicational dimension Frequency of Changing the\nTopic (FCT). Because the objects are placed at regular intervals within the world\nand the agents are randomly moving across the world, the shorter the step length,\nthe longer the agents will be participating in communicative interactions about the\nsame object (either \u2018speaking\u2019 or \u2018hearing\u2019 about it).\n3.2. Communicative Interactions\nA communicative interaction I always involves one object o \u2208 O and two or more\nagents, where one of them is a speaker sa \u2208 A (who utters a word w with a given\nr) and at least one is a hearer (or recipient) hai \u2208 A, where i is the group to\nwhich h belongs, and sa \/\u2208 hai. The hearer hai must both see the object and hear\nMarch 17, 2010 17:47 WSPC\/INSTRUCTION FILE \u201dWhat did you say\u201d\n6 Marchione, Salgado and Gilbert\nthe speaker\u2019s voice. Therefore, I = {o, sa, hai}. In each communicative interaction\nthere is one and only one object visible to the agents and this object becomes the\ntopic of communicationb.\n3.3. The Lexicon\nA word w is a sequence of four letters drawn from a shared alphabet, where the first\nletter identifies the group origin of that word and the three remaining letters are\nrandomly chosen following the rule Consonant - Vowel - Consonant. The lexicon\nis implemented as an association between a word w and a topic o measured by a\nvalue \u03c3 called the score. Each time a word w is heard by an agent hai, the score\nfor this word w and the topic o is increased or decreased depending on the result of\nthe communicative interaction, called in this simulation the \u2018chatty game\u2019c.\nThe shared lexicon is operationalized as the words which are related with the\ntopics at the end of the simulation. Because our model allows us to identify the group\norigin of each word, we can count the number of words that one group disseminates\nover the whole population.\n4. Results and analyses\nThe simulation allowed us to explore the effects of varying the two parameters,\nCapability of Reaching Recipients (CRR) and Frequency of Changing the Topic\n(FCT), on the likelihood that an agent is able to spread its word-topic associa-\ntions to other agents and especially to other groups. To study the effect of spatial\nlocation, the agents were given the ability to move on a square grid, divided into\nfour quadrants coloured green, yellow, blue and violet. The region for each group of\nagents is represented by the corresponding colour. Groups of 10 agents were located\nat random positions on each of the four quadrants at the start of each run. Dur-\ning the simulation, the agents can move freely over the grid. Also located in each\nquadrant is one example of each of four objects: a flower, a leaf, a tree and a plant\n(represented by appropriately shaped icons). Figure 2 shows a view of the square\ngrid.\nMeasurements on this grid are in pixel units. Each quadrant is 40 units wide (so\nthe grid as a whole is 80\u00d780). At each time step, every agent can move one step\nlength, an agent per group is randomly selected to be a speaker and it attempts to\ncarry out a Chatty Game with all the hearers within range, with the nearest object\nas the topic. The simulation continues until the emergent shared lexicon contains\none word for each object (i.e., the shared lexicon contains four words). The model\nwas built using NetLogo 4.0.4 [18].\nbIn the rare case an agent, speaker or hearer, is located over the boundary of two visibility areas,\nit selects one random object as the chatty game\u2019s topic.\ncAlthough previous research has named this kind of simulation a Language Game (and our model\nis based on that research), we want to avoid the linguistic and even philosophical implications of\nthat name. A detailed explanation of this kind of game is given in [16] .\nMarch 17, 2010 17:47 WSPC\/INSTRUCTION FILE \u201dWhat did you say\u201d\n\u2018What did you say?\u2019 7\nFig. 2. View of the simulation\nExperiments were carried out by setting the values of CRR and FCT of the\nagents in one quadrant, while leaving the values of these parameters for the agents\nin the other three quadrants at their arbitrarily chosen default settings (CRR =\n13 and FCT = 0.7). 121 such experiments were performed, by sweeping the first\nquadrants\u2019 agents through combinations of CRR and FCT values, varying CRR\nfrom 8 units to 18 units, and FCT from 0.2 increasing by 0.2 to 1.2. The number of\nwords coming from each group, as well as the number of words in the final shared\nlexicon, were averaged over 200 runs of each experiment. Statistical analysis on\nthese results was then carried out using R [9].\nFigure 3 shows the number of words in the shared lexicon at the end of the\nruns contributed by the experimental group, plotted against CRR and FCT. Using\nOLS regression, a best-fitting plane is also shown. The plane slopes negatively along\nthe FCT dimension, showing that the greater the frequency of topic changing, the\nfewer words there are in the shared lexicon. The positive slope along the CRR\ndimension indicates that the greater the capability of reaching other agents, the\nlarger the number of words in the shared lexicon. We conclude that a group of\nagents endowed with a high CRR and a low FCT would have the highest likelihood\nof spreading part or all of its word-topic associations to the other groups.\nThese correlations pose an obvious question: Why would \u2018speaking loudly\u2019 (high\nCRR) and \u2018moving slowly\u2019 (low FCT) have the highest likelihood of affecting the\nshared lexicon? We address this question by three consecutive steps: (1) we highlight\nseveral aspects that might influence the likelihood of affecting the shared lexicon;\n(2) we propose a way to measure these aspects and (3) we identify the extent to\nMarch 17, 2010 17:47 WSPC\/INSTRUCTION FILE \u201dWhat did you say\u201d\n8 Marchione, Salgado and Gilbert\nFig. 3. Simulations Results.\nwhich each of those aspects can alter the probability of spreading a word in the\nshared lexicon.\nBeacause we want to look in great detail at the origin of a single word, our\nanalysis is performed on a sample obtained by a single run of the simulation. For\neach time-step we recorded the speaker, the hearer(s), the topic of the conversation\nand the uttered word. Since we are interested in monitoring the process of creating\na word and the way this spreads to the whole population, the data was filtered, first\nto focus on a single object (e.g., flower), and then to reject all data where the uttered\nword did not subsequently change. That is, we consider all data until the step where\nthe final word for that object emerges. This is the point where the word reaches the\nhighest score \u03c3 for that object in the lexicon. Figure 4 shows the number of words\ncreated for each object over time. The dot on each line indicates the point after\nwhich the uttered word does not change. At that point, all the agents already share\na common word-topic association. This filtering permits clearer observation of the\nmechanisms involved in creating and spreading a certain word-object association.\nWe sampled a simulation with CRR = 18 and FCT = 0.2 for one group \u2014\nin this case, the \u2018violet\u2019 group \u2014 and CRR = 8 and FCT = 1.2 for the other\ngroups. According to the OLS regression shown in Figure 3, we chose this particular\nsettings because it guarantees the highest probability that the word, associated to\nthe selected object, comes form the experimental group. As expected, most of the\nMarch 17, 2010 17:47 WSPC\/INSTRUCTION FILE \u201dWhat did you say\u201d\n\u2018What did you say?\u2019 9\nFig. 4. Filtering Process Simulation 1.\nFig. 5.

Firstly, they\nare mostly on the left hand side of the plot; this means that they hear from fewer\nspeakers than agents in other groups. Secondly, several agents from the \u2018violet\u2019\ngroup are located at the top of the plot; this means that they speak to a greater\nnumber of agents compared to other groups. Thirdly, there is a high occurrence of\nreciprocal relations among agents of the \u2018violet\u2019 group because the links connecting\nthem are darker. These observations allow us to highlight three characteristics that\ndrive the evolution of the model: (1) the capability of hearing from other groups;\n(2) the capability of speaking to other groups; and (3) the mutual relations among\nagents within the same group.\nIn order to define the effect of these three aspects on the groups\u2019 capability of\nspreading their words we will formalize each of them. The capability of hearing from\nother groups Hg and the capability of speaking to other groups Sg are measured as\nfollow:\nDefinition 1. Hearing capability of group g\nLet P be the set of all groups. Let a be an agent of group g, and b be an agent of\nanother group h. Let Iab be the occurrence of the relation between a speaker a and\na hearer b.

The mutual relation between agents within the same\ngroup is measured using a definition of distance: the smaller the distance between\ntwo agents, the stronger is their mutual relation.\nMarch 17, 2010 17:47 WSPC\/INSTRUCTION FILE \u201dWhat did you say\u201d\n\u2018What did you say?\u2019 11\nDefinition 3.

This relationship summarises our understanding of the\nmechanism involved in the evolution of the model.

The pg value for the \u2018violet\u2019 group is by far the greatest\nin Simulation 1 (99%). In order to test the validity of our analysis we performed\nanother simulation where all the groups had the same value of CRR and FCT .\nIn this scenario it is a matter of chance which group has the highest likelihood of\nspreading a word within the shared lexicon, because all the groups have the same\nparameters. However, performing the analysis presented above, the probability that\na group affects the shared lexicon can be calculated. As example we consider the\nword associated with the object \u2018flower\u2019 in the shared lexicon, which, in this second\nsimulation, comes from the yellow group.

It considers only already defined groups. What could be\nof interest to investigate is the role played by mixed groups. Sometimes the anal-\nysis shows that a certain group has a higher probability for affecting the lexicon,\nalthough the word in the shared lexicon comes from another group. This happens\nbecause there are mixed groups, where for instance an agent from the blue group\nexploits the high overall mutual relation value of the green group and spreads its\nown word in the shared lexicon.\n5. Conclusions\nIn this paper we have reported a computer simulation about the emergence of sym-\nbolic communication that considers some spatial constraints. This simulation aimed\nto model the emergence of a symbolic communicative system over time in a way\nthat reproduces two important evolutionary pressures: the improbability that one\ncultural sign means the same for different agents and the improbability that speak-\ners can reach recipients beyond those present. Based on these improbabilities, we\ndefined a theoretical model that combines two dimensions: the capability of reaching\nrecipients, which was operationalized as the audibility radius, and the frequency of\nchanging the topic, which was operationalized as the step length. The combination\nMarch 17, 2010 17:47 WSPC\/INSTRUCTION FILE \u201dWhat did you say\u201d\n\u2018What did you say?\u2019 13\nFig. 6. Filtering Process Simulation 2.\nFig. 7. Network Simulation 2.\nof these two dimensions results in different communicative strategies, modeled here\nby different groups of agents. By using this simulation wee have clarified what agent\nbehaviour most effectively spreads their own cultural signs across the population\nand by a further analysis we have explained why that is the case.\nThe model shows that the group of agents able to reach more hearers and less\nprone to changing the topic has the highest likelihood of affecting the shared lexicon.\nMarch 17, 2010 17:47 WSPC\/INSTRUCTION FILE \u201dWhat did you say\u201d\n14 Marchione, Salgado and Gilbert\nIn terms of agents\u2019 actions, that group manifests some sort of reiterative behavior:\nthese agents perform many communicative interactions about the same topic. This\nbehaviour leads these agents to share a strong word-topic association widely. The\ninteraction of this group of agents with other groups (with different behaviours)\nbrought about another effect: the agents are not particularly aware of the other\ngroups\u2019 word-topic associations. They move around a small area, and hardly explore\nthe rest of the world (i.e., they hardly change their topic). The spreading of their\nlexicon is in fact carried out by the other groups, particularly those which move\nmore quickly (i.e., they frequently change their topic).\nThe results suggest two issues which demand further research. Firstly, we hy-\npothesised that differences between group behaviours produce different \u2018commu-\nnicative roles\u2019. The simulation could represent a kind of social division of labour [2]:\nsome clusters of agents are \u2018in charge\u2019 of spreading, whereas others are \u2018in charge\u2019\nof creating strong relations between topics and words. Thus, in our model, agents\u2019\nheterogeneity produces social homogeneity. Secondly, as stressed in section 4, the\nanalysis indicates that ever when a certain group has a higher likelihood of spread-\ning its lexicon, its shared cultural signs can actually have a different group origin.\nThis could happen because there are mixed groups, when for instance an agent from\nthe blue group exploits the high overall mutual relation value of the green group\nand spreads its own word in the shared lexicon.\nReferences\n[1] Blumer, H., Symbolic Interactionism: Perspective and Method (University of Califor-\nnia Press, 1992).\n[2] Durkheim, E., The Division of Labour in Society, 13th edn.
