In this paper I examine this project through a consideration of the problem \nof cognitive polyphasia, and the continuity and discontinuity between different \nsystems of knowing. Focusing on the relations between science and common \nsense. I ask why, despite considerable evidence to the contrary, the scientific \nimagination tends to deny its relation to common sense and believe that can \ndisplace it. I argue that the psychosocial dynamic between common sense and \nscience is revealing of how heavily they are entangled in, and indeed indebted to \neach other. Even more, this dynamic allows for a full appreciation of what the \ntheory of social representations calls states of cognitive polyphasia. Different \nsystems of thinking and knowing do not displace each other but live side by side, \nco-existing in a variety of ways, fulfilling different functions and answering \ndifferent needs in social life. \n \nKeywords: social representations, common sense, science, cognitive polyphasia, \npsychoanalysis, everyday life.   \n 3 \nIntroduction \n \nIn 1924 Otto Rank spoke before an audience at the New School for Social \nResearch about psychoanalysis as a cultural factor (Rank, 1996). He argued that \nFreud\u2019s genius consisted in demonstrating the continuum between the \npsychopathological and what is \u2018natural and human everywhere\u2019. He pointed to \nthe applicability of psychoanalysis to \u2018vigorous life\u2019 and went on to say that it had \n\u201ca closer relation to the content of folk beliefs and popular traditions than to dry \ndoctrine, and so it has never lost contact with reality\u201d (Rank, 1996:85). Some 30 \nyears later a social psychologist working in France set out to study and to \ndemonstrate in a systematic and detailed manner how psychoanalysis meets \n\u2018vigorous life\u2019, enters the public sphere and becomes a cultural factor. The result \nwas a book that went on to become a classic in the social psychology of \nknowledge and the original foundation for the theory of social representations. It \nis a book that brings to the fore the continuum between life and knowledge, \nbetween science and common sense, between a psychology of rationality and \ncognition and a psychology of experience, emotion and society.  \n \nPsychoanalysis, its image and its public (from now on PIP) is a book about \nFreud\u2019s theory in the public sphere and about how one form of knowledge, \npsychoanalysis, becomes another, common sense. It is exemplary of Moscovici\u2019s \naims towards social psychology, of what it should and it could be. Indeed in it we \nfind all the elements that make it not only a study on the social psychology of \nknowledge but also the point of departure for a social psychological perspective \nthat actively seeks to address the more general questions being posed by the \nsocial sciences as a whole. What are the relations between science and common \nsense, how does social knowledge evolve as it moves between different social \ncontexts and is appropriated by different social actors, how do emotional and \nsocial forces shape systems of knowing? These are just some of the central \nquestions permeating the book as it unravels the trajectory of psychoanalysis in \nthe public sphere. None of these questions has aged. They are still central to \n 4 \nsocial scientific inquiry and remain, to a large extent, unresolved theoretical \nproblems.   \n \nThe appearance of PIP in English some fifty years after its publication in France \ngives us the opportunity to readdress some of the questions Moscovici \nintroduced then and position them in a historical context. It also gives us the \nchance to juxtapose Moscovici and Freud and consider some of the underlying \nissues that even though neither addressed explicitly can be explored further \nusing theoretical resources offered by both. Freud and Moscovici are at one \nwhen it comes to the problem of continuity and discontinuity in apparently \ndisparate, oppositional phenomena. Each in their own way dealt with the co-\nexistence of opposites and the relational nature of all reality. They rejected the \nview that common sense and folk beliefs are a lesser form of knowledge that at \nsome point should be overcome by a more dignified and superior form of \nknowing, which in our contemporary world happens to be science. On the \ncontrary, they engaged with everyday thinking and sought to understand how it \noperates in our psychological and social lives. Whereas neither Moscovici nor \nFreud would deny science and rationality, both challenged the sovereignty of the \nrational subject and pointed to the antinomies embedded in human reason.  \n \nIn fact Moscovici and Freud were fascinated by both the rational and the irrational \nand actively sought the line of continuity between the objective, cold and succinct \nlaws of a cognitive outlook capable of dispassionately understanding the world, \nand the subjective, hot and erratic dynamics of human passion, imposing \ndisorder and capturing the world by feeling and imagination.  If anything I would \nsay that they wished for a wiser reason and an emancipated emotional life, each \nable to engage and establish a dialogue with its other, so that both reason and \nemotion could face the various and multiple reasons each tends to deny. Freud \npointed to the unconscious as our double, our \u2018other\u2019 side; Moscovici pointed to \ncommon sense, as the unrelenting undercurrent of science, its doppelg\u00e4nger, its \ndenied other. But both views contain more than catches the eye, for the \n 5 \nunconscious and common sense are not just the \u2018other\u2019 of reason and science. \nThey require understanding in their own right and this can only come from the \npermanent and reciprocal pathways that make the continuities and discontinuities \nbetween all of these phenomena. \n \nIn this paper I reflect on these issues addressing the problem of continuity and \ndiscontinuity between different systems of knowing through a consideration of the \ninter-relations between common sense and science. I ask why, despite \nconsiderable evidence to the contrary, the scientific imagination tends to deny its \nrelation to common sense and believe that can displace it. I argue that the \npsychosocial dynamic between common sense and science is revealing of how \nheavily science and common sense are entangled in, and indeed indebted to, \neach other. Even more, this dynamic allows for an appreciation of the insight \nMoscovici introduced in PIP about cognitive polyphasia. Different systems of \nthinking and knowing do not displace each other but live side by side, co-existing \nin a variety of ways, fulfilling different functions and answering different needs in \nsocial life. This assumption can both illuminate the empirical study of encounters \nbetween knowledge systems in the contemporary world and perhaps even more \nimportantly, the very epistemology of social representations and its overall \nconception of human thinking (see Markov\u00e1, this issue).  \n \nThe Battle between Science and Common Sense  \n \nIn a recent personal communication Moscovici pointed out that all the key issues \nof our thinking tradition in one guise or another collapse into two major and inter-\nrelated themes: the first is the opposition between philosophy (as high thinking) \nand common sense (as low thinking), the second is the struggle between the \nvanguard\/elite and the masses\/crowd. Hannah Arendt (1971) calls these \noppositions the warfare between philosophy and common sense, to be found in a \nline that goes from Plato straight into Kant and Hegel and all the way down to \nmore contemporary philosophies and the dynamics of the sciences. The related \n 6 \nstruggle between the elite and the crowd is found in all political philosophies of \nthe West, ranging from Marxism\u2019s dismissal of the masses fully expressed in \nLenin\u2019s theory of the vanguard, to populist and fascist ideologies, which use the \nmasses but conceive of them as childish and ignorant, in a state of perpetual lack. \nMost of these theories, whether in acknowledged form or not, find parallels in Le \nBon\u2019s study of the crowds and the popular mind (Le Bon, 1982). These issues \nwere extensively discussed in Moscovici\u2019s (1985) treatise on mass psychology.  \nIndeed to my mind it is not accidental that he identifies these as major themes. \nHis own work can be read as an attempt to deal with the oppositions described \nabove. This is clearly the case in PIP but it is equally important in the work \ndedicated to the psychology of crowds and active minorities where he seeks to \nunderstand how ordinary people operating as a minority can make a difference \nand change societies and cultures. \n \nThe battles between science and common sense and between ordinary people \nand elites are magnificently exposed by Hannah Arendt in her study on the life of \nthe mind (Arendt, 1971). There she shows how deeply the thought of \nphilosophers has struggled with the world of common sense and how they \nrecurrently considered withdrawal from the world an imperative for the exercise of \nreason. The cleavage between thinking and ordinary everyday common sense is \ndeep and widespread. As she remarks, \u201cthe whole history of philosophy, which \ntells us so much about the objects of thought and so little about the process of \nthinking and the experiences of the thinking ego, is shot through with an \nintramural warfare between man\u2019s common sense, this sixth sense that fits our \nfive senses into the world, and man\u2019s faculty of thought and need of reason, \nwhich determine him to remove himself for considerable periods from \nit\u201c (1971:81).  \n \nIn her observation two issues are salient: the problem of nominalisation (see \nBillig, this issue; Markov\u00e1, this issue) which separates thought from its \nconnection with situated thinking practices, and the rejection of everyday social \n 7 \nlife as a potential source of enlightenment and reason. Philosophers have \nrecurrently detached thought from thinking processes and the experiences of the \nthinking self so that an idealised, and disconnected, form of thought could \nemerge. Thought becomes an abstraction, a solipsistic practice carried out by an \nindividual removed from the world, a highly individualised practice. In this process \nthought is opposed to ordinary everyday life; indeed everyday life does not \ncomport thinking and in order to think properly the philosopher must withdraw \nfrom the world. Through a painstaking examination of philosophical conceptions \nof thinking and common sense Arendt shows the extent of the separation \nbetween thinking and the world of everyday life. It is common sense that \nconcerns itself with the latter; thought is only preoccupied with itself. Arendt \nshows that this antecedes by far the modern era; in fact the Cartesian cogito is \njust another instance of a much older Western tradition that requires for thought \nan attitude of detachment from the world. Contemplation reserves to itself the \nhigher ground and all the critical capacities of an observer who can afford the \nperspective of a non-participant. Involvement with a life that must be lived is not \nin the realm of the philosopher; lived experience and its demands of full \nimmersion in the everyday necessities of biological, social and cultural pains are \nleft to common sense.   \n \nIt is thus common sense that must sustain a human life and indeed the survival of \nthe species \u2013 not to mention the survival of the philosopher. Not accidently then \nthat it is called by many languages the good sense. The notion of common sense \nis very old, being a direct translation from the Latin sensus communis, which in \nits turn translates more or less directly from the Greek koinos nous (Lewis, 1960).  \nFrom Aristotle throughout the medieval tradition sensus communis appeared \nstrongly tied up to notions of inter-subjectivity and commonality uniting the \nfaculties of understanding and imagination. Medieval anatomists, whose early \nexplorations of the brain were firmly entangled in philosophical assumptions, \npositioned sensus communis in one of the three chambers of the brain next to \nthe intellect, the imaginative capacities and the memory (Bennet and Hacker, \n 8 \n2002). Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s drawing of a skull depicts the sensus communis as \nthe very seat of the soul (Da Vinci, 1482). The Islamic medical philosopher \nAvicenas saw it as a cerebral ventricle together with the faculty of fantasy and \nimagination (Davidson, 1992). Later, philosophers of the modern era cut off the \nconnection between sensus communis and the brain but continued to indicate its \nbeing a sense of and for community. Arendt (1971: 50) observes that \u201cwhat since \nTomas Aquinas we call common sense, the sensus communis, is a kind of sixth \nsense needed to keep my five senses together and fit the sensations of my \nprivate senses into a common world of shared others\u201d. In this definition she is \nalready pointing to Kant who spoke of sensus communis as an extra sense \nshared by all \u2013 like an extra mental capacity \u2013 that fits us into a community and \nfacilitates communicative understanding by linking each one of us to the lives of \nothers and the social world. Such definitions are also compatible with the Scottish \nschool of common sense philosophy, whose hidden influence in the making of \ncritical psychology Billig has recently dissected (Billig, 2008).   \n \nCommon sense is thus conceived as shared understanding, a \u2018sense\u2019 that \ntranscends the individual mind and belongs to the community. However, \nnotwithstanding its positive connotations as belonging to all and allowing \nunderstanding, any sense that belongs to the community and is common to all is \nsurely to be somehow problematic. The modern age, but not only the modern \nage, has displayed great resistance to the idea of communities of thought, which \nis better left to the individual (Jovchelovitch, forthcoming). Lewis\u2019 (1960) \nilluminating and amusing study on words captures well the ambivalence of this \nconstruction. Lewis refers to the various positive and negative meanings of \ncommon sense, showing how they come and go in unexpected and deeply \nconnected ways, so that a very positive meaning turns into something quite \nnegative as the mood of the day changes. He shows that the semantic \nconnections between sense and reason are complex enough but it is the \nambivalence of the word \u2018common\u2019 that exercises its pressure in the way we \nunderstand common sense. It is this ambivalence that \u201cpermits what may be \n 9 \ncalled a maximising or a minimising of that sense (or reason) that is common to \nall men. On the one hand, because it is universal, cutting across all frontiers and \nsurviving in all epochs, it may be reverenced. On the other, if it is as common as \nthat \u2013 like having two legs and a nose in your face \u2013 it can\u2019t be anything very \nwonderful\u201d (Lewis, 1960:153-4).      \n \nIt is the ambivalence of common sense that interests us here and contributes to \nour understanding of the warfare in which it is entangled. What is common and \nshared is at once valued and devalued, desired and vulgar. A sense that is \ncommon to all expresses a wisdom that can be easily trapped by the distortions \nand illusions of the popular mind, whose difficulties lie in its lack of reflexivity and \nthinking because of the social influence it is under. Collectives do not think, at \nmost they possess a sense because thinking properly so called is reserved for \nindividuals. What is common, and thus social, is antithetic to thinking. The link \nbetween the social, the communal, the abnormal and the deluded are too well \nknown in psychology and cannot be addressed here. But there is no doubt that \nthis link is also to be found in the ambivalence of common sense. Here we are \nback to the separation between thinking and common sense, between the \nindividual and the masses, between the elite and the crowd. Individuals and elites \nthink, the masses and the community draw on common sense and from this \nsemantic (and political) perspective there is no meeting point between the two. \n \nHowever, it is important to re-state the ambivalence of the construction. This \nambivalence fuels the contradictions of modern rationality and the very roots of \nall psychologies including those of critical inclination. Billig\u2019s recent exploration of \nthe historical roots of critical psychology shows that individualist conceptions of \ncognition and knowledge developed hand in hand with social ones. In retrieving \nthe work of Scottish philosophers Shaftesbury and Reid on common sense and \nassessing how deeply it was entangled with the work of Locke, it becomes clear \nto us that ambivalence between high and low thinking and between the individual \nand the social are present from the start.  Billig helps us to see that the warfare \n 10 \nbetween philosophy and common sense was not a unified, homogenous matter. \nCommon sense, the sensus communis, is the feeling humans have for their \ncommunity, a sense that is perhaps the most important of all senses. But is not \nseen as such by all:  \u201cCommon sense, or sense of community, lies at the heart of \nhuman nature. This itself is common sense (or plain, good sense), known to all \nexcept religious bigots or individualist philosophers (whose cool, intellectual \ntheories conflict with the good sense of ordinary people)\u201d (Billig, 2008:106). This \nconflict continues to live in the contemporary battles between science and the \nknowledge of everyday life. I turn to it next. \n \nCan common sense think? \n \nMoscovici\u2019s study of psychoanalysis developed in an intellectual context very \nmuch shaped by the battles between science and common sense. Concern with \nwhat happens to scientific knowledge once it enters the semantic universes of \nordinary people guided what in France and other Latin countries was called the \nprocess of \u2018vulgarisation\u2019 or \u2018popularisation\u2019 of science. This corresponds \napproximately to the field of public understanding of science in the Anglo-Saxon \nworld. The use of the word vulgarisation in the sixties was not accidental; \nvulgarisation refers to a process of disqualification and loss of credentials. The \nword \u2018popularization\u2019 is equally detrimental. Moscovici notes in PIP that \u201cthe very \nword popularization has a pejorative meaning and arouses opposition\u201d (2008: 49), \nwith many informants directly associating popularization and distortion. This view \nof popularization as distortion was well established in the French public sphere of \nthe fifties and sixties, in the thinking of both scientists and lay people. It is \ntempting to think that this view has been undermined by recent developments in \nthe social sciences, but the prevalence and relative dominance of the \u2018deficit \nmodel\u2019 (Hilgartner, 1990; Schiele and Jacobi, 1988) for theorizing the diffusion of \nscientific thinking shows that it has not.  \n \n 11 \nAs most intellectuals of his generation in France, Moscovici worked and wrote \nunder the impact of Marxism and the deep suspicions it held in relation to \npsychoanalysis, common sense and any kind of \u2018mental\u2019, \u2018idealistic\u2019 construction. \nMarx\u2019s assessment of ideology as a camera obscura \u2013 a system of ideas that \ndistorts reality by turning them upside-down to serve the interests of the dominant \nclass \u2013 informed the view that the common sense of ordinary people reproduces \nthe ideas of people at the top and fails to see reality as it is. In a slightly but not \naltogether dissimilar form the assumption of common sense as error and \ndistortion influenced a great deal of psychological research. Concerns with what \nPiaget called the \u2018education of reason\u2019 (Piaget, 1995) were directed to \ninvestigations on how human thought progresses from primitive to higher forms \nand ascends to a rationality that can displace the emotional and social elements \nexpressed in lay thinking. The education of reason was seen as a linear process \nof progress, where human reason moves from lower to higher systems of \nthinking expressed ultimately by science. The Vygotskyan research programme, \nalbeit not as explicit as Piaget's, sustained a very similar concern with the \neducation of reason. Soviet psychologists were testing the hypothesis that \nsocialism was to produce a society based on science, capable of leaving behind \nmyth, superstition, belief and common sense (Luria, 1931). In comparing the \nknowledge of peasants in Central Asia, considered to be the bearers of irrational \nand backward beliefs, to the new rational subject produced by the novel societal \nconditions of socialism, they sought to demonstrate how social engineering of \none particular kind could transform common sense into science (Jovchelovitch, \n2007).  \n \nThis was the intellectual atmosphere in which studies of vulgarization and \npopularization took place. The goal was to assess the extent to which science \ncould be \u2018extended\u2019 \u2013 in Freire\u2019s sense of transportation from one community to \nanother \u2013 to the lay public and yet retain its integrity and avoid distortion \n(Barbichon and Moscovici, 1965; Dulong and Ackermann, 1972; Jacques and \nRaichvarg, 1991). The view of transportation, of extension, of transference was \n 12 \nrecurrent then and it has not lost its appeal today. Indeed the study of common \nsense continues to be permeated by an attitude of suspicion that systematically \ndeprives it of epistemological status and often equates it with distortion, bias, \nerror and ignorance. Within psychology, but not only in psychology, there is a \nstrong tendency to consider lay knowledge and everyday understandings as \nobstacles, noise, and errors to be removed: the superstitions, mythologies and \nfalse beliefs they carry should be replaced with the truth of expert or scientific \nknowledge. Entire fields of research and intervention are based on this \nassumption. Health educational programs, for instance, tend to operate with the \nassumption that lay beliefs have to be removed and replaced with scientific \nknowledge (Campbell, 2003). Development interventions have equally treated \nlocal knowledge as an obstacle to the aims of progress and technical \nachievement (Escobar, 1995). And the whole idea of public understanding of \nscience has been based on the assumption that the public must be educated and \ntaught to understand scientific theories \u2018correctly\u2019 (Wynne, 1995).  \n \nBehind all these efforts is the underlying premise that be it the public, be it the \nlocals or be it lay people, they all must abandon their existing common sense \nbeliefs and ascend to the superior form of knowing offered by experts, \ntechnocrats and scientists.  \n \nCommon Sense and the Scientific Imagination \n \nThe devaluation of common sense goes hand in hand with the modern tendency \nto glorify science and to conceive it as the source of true knowledge, \ntechnological innovation and human progress (Bauer, forthcoming). These are \ntwo sides of a single process that inaugurates one system of knowing as \npreponderant and superior and by the same token defines all others as inferior \nstages in a scale of development. We know that much of this impetus came from \nthe trajectory of the scientific imagination since the Enlightenment and in \nparticular from the utopias of the first half of the 20th century, when science was \n 13 \npowerfully connected to projects of understanding and change both for self and \nfor society. Science was conceived as a liberating system of knowing, the only \none that could give us reality as it is and therefore be therapeutic at the level of \nthe subject and emancipatory at the level of society. However, as discussed \nabove, this impetus also expresses, although buried in a much longer past, the \nuncoupling of thought and everyday life and the belief that critical capacities and \nprogress necessitate a reason detached from its own living context.   \n \nFreud and Moscovici shared this legacy and did not completely escape from the \npressures of the scientific imagination. In fact I would say they were part of it and \nactively reinforced it, albeit in different moments and in a highly ambivalent way. \nThis is exemplarily articulated by Freud in The Future of an Illusion, where he \ntriumphantly declares \u201cno, science is not an illusion. But an illusion it would be to \nsuppose that what science cannot give us we can get elsewhere\u201d (1927: p.241). \nYet, Freud went in search of illusions and so did Moscovici. Freud\u2019s theoretical \nedifice was constructed step by step on the basis of taking seriously the world of \nculture and common sense. Freud listened to his patients as no doctor did in his \nday, and scandalously enough allowed their lay words enter into his theories (see \nBillig, this issue). Jahoda argues that \u201cthroughout his working life he [Freud] was \nconcerned with assembling confirmation to the idea of closeness of opposites. \nHe found it in folk wisdom, in myth and fairy tales (the ugly frog turned into the \nbeautiful prince), in legend and poetry, in primitive ritual, but above all in \nlanguage with its remnant of primitive thought\u201d (1977:44-5).  Moscovici took a \nvery similar route. He considered the struggle of ideas in the public sphere and \nthe structure of everyday thinking as related to science but not necessarily \nsubordinated to it; he saw these as highly expressive phenomena to be \nunderstood in their own right, systems of knowing akin to Winnicottian potential \nspaces where identities are formed, worldviews take shape and traditions are \nperpetuated and challenged. They cannot, and should not, be reduced to science. \nIn fact, they constitute science and can be found at the very origins of science.   \n \n 14 \nThese assumptions have now been largely demonstrated, even if not fully \nincorporated into practices and accepted by researchers. Markov\u00e1 (this issue) \nshows how scientists operate within epistemological environments that, \nsearching for certainty and unchangeable universals, preclude new ideas in \nscience. Yet the evidence amassed by studies on the public understanding of \nscience has shown convincingly that ordinary people invest science with ideas, \nvalues and meanings that are linked to their social and psychological contexts \n(Farr, 1993; Hilgartner, 1990; Wynne, 1989). And so do scientists. Even though \nMoscovici\u2019s main goal in PIP was to map the transformation of science into \ncommon sense, the original study opened up a new platform for researchers \ninterested in doing precisely the opposite. This is clearly the case in Bauer and \nGaskell\u2019s research on biotechnology in the public sphere (Bauer and Gaskell, \n2002; Gaskel and Bauer, 2001) which constitutes a comprehensive theoretical \nand empirical examination of how common sense resists, reframes and \neventually reconstitutes science, co-creating scientific agendas and establishing \nthe basis of a common language in both scientific theories and fields of \napplication. The extent to which Moscovici\u2019s original programme has inspired this \nlarge international comparison has been elaborated in detail by the authors in the \npages of this journal (see Bauer and Gaskell, 1999; and Bauer and Gaskell, this \nissue). Likewise research on social studies of science teaches us that there is an \nintimate connection between the institutional and reified world of the lab and the \ninformal, consensual world of everyday life and common sense (Knorr-Cetina \nand Mulkay, 1983; Latour, 1987). Whereas the two-way exchanges between \nscience and common sense are now beyond doubt, this was less so in the mid-\nfifties and certainly not so at the beginning of the 20th century when the sciences, \nand in particular the human and social sciences, were fighting hard for their \nepistemological credentials.  \n \nPsychoanalysis, its Image and its Public tried to capture precisely the exchanges \nbetween science and common sense by showing how representations of \npsychoanalysis in the public sphere went far beyond the idea and practice of \n 15 \npsychoanalysis described in books and held by its professional practitioners. But \nrather than seeing it as distortion and vulgarisation, Moscovici saw the process \nas an expression of what happens to knowledge systems when they move from \none context to another through communication and social exchanges. Moscovici \njuxtaposed to the idea of vulgarisation, the view that contexts of reception \nactively appropriate the symbolic materials they receive. The appropriations and \nsocial transformation of psychoanalytic knowledge expressed the symbolic and \nsocial dimensions of all knowledge, its sensitivity to local contexts and debunked \nthe idea of transfer and extension. As in Freire (1973), communication rather \nthan extension was the key to understand the transformation of knowledges.  \n  \nIn addition, and perhaps even more radically, Moscovici\u2019s study postulated the \nwisdom of common sense and its irreducibility to any other knowledge system \n(see Jesuino Correa, this issue). Only a historical perspective allows us to \nunderstand just how daring this is and how fully it is related to what Duveen \n(2000) has called Moscovici\u2019s social psychological imagination. What Moscovici \nis rejecting here is the long and deep-seated cleavage between thought and the \ncommon sense of everyday life. Communities can think and understanding how \nthey do it is a pivotal task (Jovchelovitch, forthcoming). Studying social \nrepresentations of psychoanalysis meant going counter to the spirit of the times \nand to the ethos of bringing the commonsensical knowledge of ordinary people to \nthe higher stage of true knowledge, i.e., science. The everyday, he showed, is a \npowerful source of knowledge; it may be a different type of knowledge than \nscientific and technological knowledge, but no less wise in the \u201cknow-hows\u201d and \n\u201cknow-whys\u201d it contains. What may look irrational, or wrong to the observer \nmakes sense to the actors of knowledge, and it is also, if not only, in this sense \nthat a knowledge system must be assessed: in relation to the significance and \npsychological reality it has for those who actually produce it and use it. Besides, \nideas are generative in social life, as much as economic and \u201cmaterial processes\u201d, \nand with Weber, Moscovici understood the \u201cpower of the idea\u201d (Moscovici, 1993; \nDuveen, 2000).  \n 16 \n \nIn this sense and from the very beginning the theory of social representations \nmilitates against the view that everyday knowledge is distortion and error. It \nseeks to recover the epistemological status of common sense knowledges and \n\u2018to understand the understandings\u2019 they express, the functions they fulfill and the \nhuman needs they address. This is perhaps one of the most important lessons \nthat comes out of research in the social psychology of knowledge: the realization \nthat common sense knowledges do not go away for the simple reason that they \nare functional to human life responding to problems and needs that science does \nnot, and indeed cannot, respond to. Let me examine this in what follows.   \n    \nThe Lifeworld,  Common Sense and Cognitive Polyphasia \n \nThe world of common sense \u2013 or the lifeworld, as it was named by the \nphenomenological movement \u2013 is our paramount reality, an evolved achievement \nof our species. Common sense, common knowledge, social intelligence, folk \nknowledge, habitus, thinking-as-usual, collective and social representations; all of \nthese terms have featured in frameworks that dealt with the problem of what \nconstitutes the human and what holds social life together (Durkheim, 1905\/1963, \nGadamer, 1975, Goody, 1998; Heider, 1958; Schutz and Luckman, 1974). In \nHabermas\u2019 (1989) theory of communicative action, the concept of the lifeworld is \ncentral to define both the context of community and the conditions for all possible \ncommunication. He characterises the lifeworld as the space where people \ncommunicate in order to reach understanding and in this process come to \nconstruct and consolidate the intersubjectively recognised elements of a shared \nunderstanding about the world. The lifeworld takes shape in language and \ncommunication and appears as \u2018a reservoir of taken-for-granteds, of unshaken \nconvictions that participants in communication draw upon in cooperative \nprocesses of interpretation\u2019 (Habermas, 1992:124). It refers to the unproblematic \nknowledge that supplements, accompanies and provides the context for \ncommunicative action: the traditions, the natural languages, the presuppositions \n 17 \nand assumptions that govern everyday life. While seeking mutual understanding \nactors engage in processes of communication that do not disappear, but solidify \nin symbolic structures of meaning and understanding that become the common \nsense knowledges of the lifeworld.   \n \nThis multifaceted and intersubjectively achieved knowledge of the lifeworld \nprovides the points of reference, the parameters, the resources against which \nindividuals make sense of the world around them, develop the theoretical and \npractical competencies to deal with the everyday and establish the \ncommunicative relations that allow for the development of bonds of solidarity and \ncooperation. By making possible and facilitating social action, establishing and \nrenewing the inter-personal relations that provide the developing child with a \nsense of self and giving to social actors a framework for identity and belonging, \nthe common sense knowledges of the lifeworld construct and reconstruct self, \nsociety and culture. Whereas the common knowledge of communities appears in \neveryday life as a given, as an already-there stock of meanings and resources \nfrom which community members draw norms, regulations and patterns of \nbehaviour, its horizon is also constructed through the experience of life each day. \nThe concept of the lifeworld captures well this double character of common \nsense knowledge: of being already there, of providing foundation and ground and \nat the same time of having to be constantly produced and renewed by social \nactors.  \n \nElsewhere I have suggested that the theory of social representations intersects \nwith phenomenological traditions in important ways and nowhere more clearly \nthan in its approach to everyday life and what in PIP Moscovici called natural \nthinking and common sense (Jovchelovitch, 2007). Social representations are \nper excellence instances of common sense knowledge and the effort to theorise \nand study social representations can be easily placed in the tradition of the \nphenomenology of everyday life. With other neighbouring disciplines, the theory \nshares an interest in bringing to light the structure of worldviews, of beliefs and \n 18 \nforms of life that can produce a theory of everyday life and the knowledge it \nproduces. This knowledge, which is always plural, is deeply entangled in the \nlifeworld and lived experience of a community, demarcating its frameworks for \nthinking, doing and relating. It is a type of knowledge that has been historically \nquestioned; indeed some would not call it knowledge at all. The phenomenology \nof everyday life, however, is concerned precisely with the legitimacy of such \ncommon sense knowledges and the dimensions they express: identities, \npractices, relationships, cultural traditions and the history of a community. \n \nIn this vein, the study of social representations has developed a social \npsychology of common sense that tries to capture its constructive energies and \nfundamental functions in social and psychological lives. Social representational \ntheorists point to the historical character of common sense (Moscovici, 2000a; \n2000b), to its socially shared nature evidenced in the role of language and \ncommunication in its formation (Markov\u00e1, 2003) and to its centrality in providing \nframes of reference that allow interpretation and orientation in social life (Jodelet, \n2002; Wagner and Hayes, 2005). Current empirical studies in this field are \namassing evidence and theoretical insight into new exchanges between \nknowledge systems, on the nature of the dialogues shaping representational \nfields in complex public spheres and on the variety of knowledge outcomes being \nproduced by these novel conditions.  No single knowledge\/public juxtaposion is \nhomogenous and straightforward; there are complex mediations between \ndifferent forms of knowing and different publics, with new forms emerging in-\nbetween. Such is the case with what Wagner (2007) has called vernacular \nscience knowledge, a widely distributed form of understanding science \nsomewhere in-between everyday thinking and scientific literacy. New forms of \ncommon sense are continuously being produced by the dialogues between \nknowledges, which in turn push back into the parenting knowledge systems \ngenerating states of cognitive polyphasia in representational fields and provoking \na psychological, social and historical process of transformation in knowledge.     \n \n 19 \nThe study of common sense and lifeworlds is thus pointing clearly to the \nvariability and plasticity of the knowledge and the thinking of human communities. \nCommon sense and the structures of lifeworlds are constantly changing and \nreadjusting in novel and complex dialogical relations. Science, religion, common \nsense, beliefs and ideologies to cite just some of the potential forms of \nknowledge do not remain untouched by the inter-group contexts in which they are \nbred and grow (Duveen, 2007). They produce states of cognitive polyphasia, the \nconcept first introduced by Moscovici in PIP. Despite having remained for a long \nperiod buried within the theoretical corpus of social representations, cognitive \npolyphasia is now guiding research theoretically and empirically. The concept \nexpresses the plurality of representational fields, where differing, and at times \nconflicting, styles of thinking, meanings and practices co-exist in the same \nindividual, institution, group or community. But as Markov\u00e1 argues in this Special \nIssue the concept also refers to an epistemological conception of human thinking. \nIt helps us to understand the multiplicity of voices expressed in the language of \nindividual speakers and within public spheres. It is a concept that captures the \ninter-subjective, and therefore communicative, nature of all knowledge systems, \nand the heterogeneity and diversity of human communities. As we argued \nelsewhere \u201cit links cognition and knowledge to their social context of production \nand provides the means to theorise how different representations, meanings and \nstyles of thinking co-exist in public spheres\u201d (Renedo and Jovchelovitch, 2007).  \n \nPolyphasic representational fields are assets from which individuals and \ncommunities draw the tools, concepts, practices and meanings that enable them \nto cope with the everyday and make sense of what is going on (Jovchelovitch, \n2002, 2007; Renedo and Jovchelovitch, 2007). They are functional to the life of \ncommunities, for the survival of the species and of course for the survival of the \nthinking philosopher who shares with his fellow human beings the accumulated \nwisdom of the knowledges operating in the lifeworld. Rather than being \nmonological in content, cognitive polyphasia in representational fields expresses \n 20 \nthe dialogical nature of all knowledge systems and the constant networks of inter-\nrelations that form the experience of life each day.  \n \nReturn of the Repressed? The Negation of Common Sense and Everyday \nIdeas \n \nIt is difficult to understand how, given the foundational role of common sense in \nsocial and individual lives, it has not been able to preclude the generalised \nderision it elicits. Scientists, in one way or another, continue to be disdainful of \ncommon sense, considering it as \u2018defective knowledge\u2019 that is incapable of \nrejecting the world of appearances and operating counter-intuitively. Seen as the \nwork of the masses it is judged as irrational and blind. Einstein, who greatly \nappreciated the importance of daily experience (Einstein, 1983) was still able to \nobserve that \u2018common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by the age of \neighteen\u2019. Simone Weil bluntly remarked that \u2018collectivities do not think\u2019 and \nBachelard (2002: 25), speaking of common sense as opinion, noted that \u2018opinion \nthinks badly; it does not think but instead translates needs into knowledge\u201d, \nunderlined in the original). However, and ironically enough, no computer program \nhas ever been able to replicate common sense. That is why even the smartest of \nall computers cannot sustain a basic conversation. Common sense may well \nrefer to the obvious and be considered as just a collection of self-evident \ncommon places but scientists are struggling hard, and until now unsuccessfully, \nto find the key to replicate it (Elio, 2002; Lifschitz, 1990; McCarthy, 1984).  \n \nScience therefore tends to deride common sense despite its foundational role, its \ncomplexity and its capacity for adaptation and change. Even more, as discussed \nabove, a great deal of the effort of science is to displace common sense, to raise \nit to the realm of science, to make sure that, as Freud used to say in relation to \nthe Id, \u201cwhere there is common sense there shall be science\u201d. Now the belief that \nscience will one day replace its crucial functions and displace common sense is \nin itself a belief amenable for psychological interrogation. Why would science \n 21 \nwant to do away with common sense, can it ever do without common sense? \nWhy the warfare against common sense? What is at stake in its rejection by the \nthinking philosopher, and by the scientist of today?  \n \nLet us then, in the manner of Freud, pursue the clinic of the scientific attitude and \nlay bare its unconscious operations. The first psychological operation is the sharp \ndivision between the scientist and the lay man: we are not alike, we are not the \nsame. The second is the devaluation of common sense, the devaluing and \nrejection of the other: common sense thinks badly or does not think, it is error \nand distortion. The third psychological operation that follows is displacement of \nthe Other by the I: get rid of common sense and replace it by the one and best \nway of thinking.   In the troubled relation of science to common sense we find the \ncombination of a double denial and an underlying illusion of omnipotence: a \ndenial of the intelligence, wisdom and necessity of common sense, a denial of \nthe role common sense plays in the making of science and the illusion that one \nday science, the one and best knowledge, will replace common sense.   \n \nBronowski analysed the dangers of a mental state characterized by a sharp \ndivision between the scientist and ordinary people. He notes that \u201cthe fact that \nscience is there, mysterious, powerful; the fact that people are impressed by it \nbut ignorant and helpless \u2013 all this seems to me to have contributed to the \ndivision in our minds. And scientists cannot escape the responsibility for this. \nThey have enjoyed acting the mysterious stranger, the powerful voice without \nemotion, the expert and the god\u201d (1960:146). The combination between denial \nand omnipotent wish-fulfillment takes us back to the problem of the doppelg\u00e4nger, \nwhich Moscovici presented in PIP and Freud characterised in his study of the \nuncanny. The double as a defense against the fear of annihilation by the Other, \nwho is at once like and unlike what I am, who is partly me and partly not-me. The \nrejected Other is, in fact, close to home. For without common sense, without the \nfeeling for what is real, without star gazing and the primary perception of \nimmediate experience there would be none of science. It was millennia of \n 22 \nperceptual speculation and immediate perception that have allowed the \ndevelopment of science and its insistency in denying its roots speaks more about \nits own blindness than about that which it tries to disavow. \n \nBut why would science seek to do away precisely with that which needs in order \nto know in its own way? It is easy to go back to Freud here and re-establish the \ncontinuum between science and common sense: underlying the warfare between \nscience and common sense is the dream of a human condition free from its own \ngrounding in the world, holder of a rationality that would master itself and all \naround it, that in renouncing the stars, the beliefs and mythologies that provide \ncomfort and existential grounding, would develop itself as a final transcendental \nego. So Freud again: the attempt to kill all fathers, so as to become the father; \nthe danger of a superman, the dark undercurrent of human reason. \n  \n \nFrom Warfare to Co-existence: Towards Dialogicality and Polyphasia in \nKnowledge \n \nThere is of course a problem in juxtaposing science and common sense in the \nway I have done. There is no such a thing as one science and one world of \ncommon sense (Ryle, 1960). There are many. The dynamics I have tried to \nexpose may constitute a large part of the story between science and common \nsense but it is not the only one. The ambivalence I have pointed to has been \nactive and there can be no doubt that despite the derision and denial that science \nhas bestowed on common sense the frictions and asymmetries between these \ntwo systems of knowledge and thought have been engines for creativity and \ndevelopment.  \n \nScientists and philosophers know this well. As much as Bachelard led us to think \nabout the development of scientific knowledge in terms of obstacles, of which \nprimary experience and common sense are the most important ones, he himself \n 23 \nmade clear that science is itself born out of primary experience and common \nsense knowledge (2002). This is also what phenomenology so clearly taught us. \nBefore we can even think of possessing knowledge we actually belong:  \nbelonging, not knowing, is where we all start from. We belong to a culture, to a \nsociety, to a family, to a historical time and this belonging frames the knowledge \nwe construct from the outset. Blumenberg\u2019s (2000) magnificent study on the \ngenesis of the Copernican world demonstrates well these assumptions when he \nshows that all the essential preconditions of Copernicus\u2019 work were extra-\nscientific, that Copernicus understanding of heavenly bodies was possible \nbecause he had before him millennia of perceptual immediacy. Our scientific \nknowledge of heavenly bodies has been made possible by the activity of star \ngazing, whose ancestry goes back to the very beginnings of a distinctive human \nform of life. Bachelard\u2019s (1987) study of fire is equally revealing as it makes clear \nthat before we know the chemistry of fire we know we should not touch it. Most, if \nnot all, cultures have tales of interdiction for children and fire. Moscovici\u2019s \nanalysis of the psychology of scientific myths shows that myths are engines for \ncreativity and change, that they come out of the communication between science \nand common sense, originate in both realms and produce a polyphasic post-\nrational intelligence that expands both reason and common sense (Moscovici, \n1992).    \n \nAnd philosophers too have known this well being aware of how much philosophy \nrenounces when withdrawing from the world of common sense. Arendt (1971) \npoints to the loss of common sense as a great loss and makes this beautifully \nclear in the two stories she tells about the encounter between the philosopher \nand the layperson. There is the story told by Plato of the peasant Thracian girl \nwho explodes in laughter when she sees Thales fall into a well while watching the \nmotions of heavenly bodies above him. Taken by laugher she declares that \u201che \nwas eager to know the things in the sky but what was just at his feet escaped \nhim\u201d. Much later Kant, and probably unaware of Plato\u2019s story of the Thracian girl \ntells a similar tale about the Danish astronomer Tycho de Brahe and his \n 24 \ncoachman. In trying to find their way during a night journey the astronomer \nproposes that they should follow the stars he so well knew, to which the \ncoachman replies: \u201cMy dear sir, you may know a lot about heavenly bodies, but \nhere on earth you are a fool.\u201d In the warfare between high thinking and common \nsense there has been disdain and laughter both ways.  \n \nSo what for the dream of science without common sense, of cognition without \nculture, of thinking without everyday life? It is surely more desire than fact; but a \ndesire to be reckoned with, given its power to frame our perception and self-\nunderstanding. And yet, whatever the power of this dream, common sense \npersists and will persist for the simple reason that it fulfills essential functions of \nsurvival and responds to human needs that no other system of knowing can \naddress. As Habermas recently pointed out \u201cthe scientific theories which intrude \nupon the lifeworld do not touch on the framework of our everyday knowledge, \nwhich is linked to the self-understanding of speakers and actors. No science will \nrelieve common sense, even if scientifically informed, of the task of forming a \njudgement\u201d (2003:108) Because of all this common sense holds it ground and \ninsists in its perspective. \n \nThere is no need of creating a sharp divide between the worlds of science and \ncommon sense, nor of trying to see them exactly alike. They are different and in \nthis difference resides the great potential of all human knowledge. This difference \nis made of continuities and discontinuities. There is a line that separates and a \nline that unites the pheasant Thracian girl and Thales, Tycho and his coachman. \nWhat unites them is a continuation in knowledge, the remarkable plasticity which \nhumans display in processes of knowledge construction, a knowledge continuum \nthat does not erase one knowledge with another but is polyphasic and combines \nboth cognition and emotion, abstract thinking and action, philosophy and \npragmatics, science and common sense. It is a knowledge continuum that shows \nhow accomplishments in knowledge grow out of, without necessarily invalidating \nother moments and contexts of human experience. In the social psychology of \n 25 \nrepresentations we call it cognitive polyphasia, the co-existence rather than \ndisplacement of knowledge systems. \n \nSituating thought and knowledge, linking cognition and life, putting reason in its \nplace: this is the main lesson that I take from the writings of Serge Moscovici; to \nseek an understanding of how humans construct a symbolic landscape that is \ncapable of functioning both as science and as common sense, as a reality-setter \nand as a reality opener, of giving us accuracy in cognition and at the same time \ndisregarding it altogether so that the human imagination can fly, and in this fly re-\nset what we call science, imploding and violating its boundaries to produce \npreviously unimagined and unrealised scenarios.
