INTRODUCTION\nA long-standing empirical puzzle in economics is\nwhy we see so much persistent variation in produc-\ntivity, even within very narrowly defined industries.\nEconomic theory suggests that in well-functioning\nmarkets poorly performing firms should be unviable,\nand therefore exit.\nWhen comparing productivity at a more aggregate\nlevel\u2014for example, between countries or broadly\ndefined industries\u2014the measured gap (say between\n514\nOXFORD REVIEW OF ECONOMIC POLICY, VOL. 22, NO. 4\nthe UK and the USA) may be due to different\ncircumstances in each countries: the skills base, the\nregulatory environment, and the industry mix. Pro-\nductivity variation between industries may be ex-\nplained by, for example, different technology and\ndifferent levels of competition. But the wide and\npersistent differences that exist across establish-\nments even within very narrowly defined industries\nremain a puzzle.2\nFor example, Syverson (2004) computes the ratio of\nproductivity at the 90th percentile (very well per-\nforming firm) to the 10th percentile (very poorly\nperforming firm) within very narrowly defined manu-\nfacturing industries in the USA in 1997.3 The aver-\nage of these ratios is over 4: in other words, the top\nfirms are over four times as productive as the\nbottom firms. Criscuolo et al. (2003) perform a\nsimilar calculation for UK manufacturing in 2000\nand find that the top firms are over five times as\nproductive as the bottom firms.\nDoes persistence in such variation matter? One\nview is that it is illusory: simply an indicator that we\ndo not measure productivity very well. There are a\nwhole host of difficulties in measuring productiv-\nity\u2014government industrial classifications may not\naccurately capture firms that are undertaking simi-\nlar activities or competing in the same markets and\nwe may be mis-measuring inputs or outputs. Alter-\nnatively, productivity variation may reflect real dif-\nferences in productivity. If it does, we need to\nunderstand why variation persists and, crucially,\nwhether it is the same firms that consistently\nunderperform, or whether firms move in and out of\nbad performance\u2014for example, do firms start as\npoor performers but then move up as they gain more\nexperience? This latter situation would be one where\nthere is productivity dispersion, but where it is quite\nconsistent with a vigorous market.\nIn this paper we aim to shed light on these issues by\nlooking at productivity differences within a single\nfirm. We focus on the retail\/wholesale industry.\nRecent attention has focused on this sector as it\naccounts for close to 20 per cent of the UK\u2019s\naggregate productivity gap with the USA.4 There is\na wide dispersion in productivity in this sector, with\nthe firm at the 90th decile having just under five\ntimes higher productivity than the firm at the 10th\npercentile. The firm that we look at is a national firm\nwith many hundreds of establishments located\nthrough the United Kingdom operating in the whole-\nsaling of building and plumbing equipment. Even\nwithin this narrowly defined (four-digit) industry,\nwhen we look across firms in the UK we see that the\nfirm at the 90th percentile is around 2.7 times more\nproductive than the firm at the 10th percentile.\nThese calculations are for firms within the same\nindustry. In this paper we compare branches within\nthe same firm. By doing so, we can be more certain\nthat we are comparing \u2018like for like\u2019\u2014branches sell\nbasically the same thing\u2014and we can control for\nmany other forms of measurement error (the data\nare all collected in a similar way within the firm).\nWhen we do this we still find substantial variation in\nsales per worker and profit before income tax in\nthese establishments, with the best-performing es-\ntablishment having about five times larger sales per\nemployee than the worst performing.\nThis variation appears to be persistent. While some\npoorly performing branches improve, most branches\nremain in their relative position over years. This\nleaves us with a new puzzle\u2014why do these differ-\nences in performance persist? There is a large\nnumber of candidate reasons (which we enumerate\nbelow). One topical theory is that differences in\nproductivity might at least partly be explained by\ndifferences in management. We investigate the role\nthat local branch managers have on performance,\nusing data on management from the firm itself.\nThese data are scores that branches have achieved,\ncollected as part of the firm\u2019s balanced scorecard\nperformance-monitoring programme (they score,\nfor example, communication with staff, employee\nsatisfaction, customer service, etc.). We find a\n2 See, for example, Dunne et al. (1989), Davis and Haltiwanger (1991), Baily et al. (1992), Bernard and Jensen (1995), Davis\net al. (1996), Bartelsman and Doms (2000), Foster et al. (2002), and Disney et al. (2003).\n3 Industries are classified into one- two-, three-, etc. digit divisions, with the divisions becoming finer and finer. This study uses\n443 four-digit US manufacturing industries. Some examples of four-digit US manufacturing industries are manufactured ice, dog\nand cat food, and animal foods excluding those for dogs and cats.\n4 See, inter alia, Inklaar et al. (2003) and Griffith et al. (2003).\n515\nR. Griffith, J. Haskel, and A. Neely\nstrong correlation between this score and pro-\nductivity. Of course, this correlation does not\nimply causation. Indeed, it might reflect the sorting\nof managers between branches\u2014good branch\nmanagers are asked to manage the better branches\nwhich achieve high levels of performance both on\nthe balanced scorecard metrics and the productivity\nmetrics.\nWhat are the quantitative effects that we find? A\nmovement of a firm from the lower- to the upper-\nquartile management scores \u2018accounts\u2019 for about\n40 per cent of the inter-quartile differences in\nproductivity. In their study, using data on externally\nassessed management scores between firms, Bloom\nand Van Reenen (2006) find that management\n\u2018accounts\u2019 for around 33 per cent of inter-quartile\ndifferences in their productivity measure. We com-\nment more on these differences below.\nThe rest of this paper proceeds as follows. The next\nsection discusses the observed productivity spreads\nin the wholesaling industry and in our firm. Section\nIII investigates how much of this variation can be\nexplained by differences in management. Section\nIV concludes.\nII. PRODUCTIVITY TRENDS\nWe start by briefly reviewing what the existing\nliterature shows in terms of productivity dispersion.\nTable 1 summarizes a number of papers.\nThe first row shows the Syverson (2004) result\nreferred to above\u2014labour productivity in US manu-\nfacturing industries. The second row shows the\nspread of total factor productivity (TFP). The third\nrow shows that the labour productivity variation also\nshows up in UK manufacturing. One reason for this\nmight be that labour productivity varies owing to\ndifferent employment of other inputs, most notably\ncapital and other materials. We would expect, for\nexample, that workers producing pencils are work-\ning with very different capital to workers producing\naircraft. To control for this, the second and fourth\nrows in Table 1 shows dispersion in TFP.5 The\ndispersion still remains. The final row shows disper-\nsion in both manufacturing and services, which is, in\nfact larger, than that in manufacturing.\nWhy does such variation exist? One view is that one\nis not comparing like with like. Firms might be selling\nsuch different products that comparing pencils and\n5 TFP generalizes the single factor (labour) productivity measure and so is a multi-factor productivity measure. Rather than\ndividing by just labour input, it allows productivity to be affected by labour, capital, and material inputs, with each input weighted\nby its share in total costs. Such weighting is appropriate from an economic or index number point of view.\nTable 1\nProductivity Dispersion\nStandard deviation 90th\/10th percentile\nSyverson (2004) All US manufacturing, 0.40 4.12\nlog (value added\/employment), 1997\nlog TFP, 1997 0.34 2.68\nCriscuolo et al.

Since comparisons are often made within\nfour-digit industries, this view has less force, but it is\nclear that there are still some significant differences\nbetween firms even within the same four-digit\nindustries. One reason for these differences is the\nuse of different technologies. If capital is well\nmeasured this could be controlled for, but measure-\nment problems in capital are legion, and controlling\nfor capital does not control for other factors. Addi-\ntional complexity is added when one considers that\nthere are other\u2014often called intangible\u2014assets,\nthat are poorly measured. These intangible assets\ninclude organizational, reputational, and managerial\ncapital that may account for productivity differ-\nences.\n(i) Productivity in Wholesaling\nHow do we measure productivity in this paper? As\nin much of the literature, our basic measure is output\nover labour inputs. We have two output measures:\nsales and sales minus the costs of goods sold (this\ndiffers from value-added in that several other inter-\nmediate goods are not deducted). We measure\nlabour inputs using the wage bill, since we do not\nhave accurate measures of numbers employed in all\nbranches in all periods. This is not quite labour\nproductivity as conventionally measured, but the use\nof wages has the advantage of controlling for the\nquality of labour, which might plausibly vary be-\ntween stores. We use nominal sales. This means\nthat a branch that sells more of a good with a higher\nmark-up will appear more productive than one\nselling a product that is priced nearer to cost. We do\nnot have information on the branch-specific compo-\nsition of sales, or prices charged. However, the\nbranches within each division of the firm carry very\nsimilar products, and over a year it is likely that the\nmix of goods sold will even out. In any case, it will\nbe much more comparable than when looking across\ndifferent firms selling quite different goods.\nWhile we focus on the productivity spread within the\nfirm, at the outset it is useful to compare the firm\nwith other firms in the same industry. We focus on\nthe two largest divisions of the wholesaler which sell\nbuilding and plumbing materials. We compare these\nwith data from the Annual Respondents Database\n(ARD; see Data Appendix) for the industries SIC\n5153 and 5154, which are, respectively, \u2018wholesale\nof wood, construction materials, and sanitary equip-\nment\u2019, and \u2018wholesale of hardware, plumbing and\nheating equipment, and supplies\u2019.\nFigure 1 compares the distribution of productivity\nwithin branches of each division of the firm with the\ndistribution of productivity in establishments within\nthe relevant industry. The top graph in the top panel,\nheaded \u2018Plumb: Company\u2019 is a histogram of produc-\ntivity for the plumbing division of the company and\nthe lower graph in the top panel headed \u2018Plumb:\nIndustry\u2019 is for the four-digit industry. The lower\npanel has the analogous graphs for the building\nmaterials industry. A number of points stand out.\nThere is a wide spread of productivity within both\nthe firm and within these narrowly defined indus-\ntries. The 90\/10 ratio is about 3 to 1 within each\nindustry. There is a similar spread even within the\ncompany and even within the different divisions of\nthe company. Note that the company spread is\nsmaller, about 2 to 1, and that the company average\nis above that of the industry.\nTable 2 sets out some further details about the\ndistribution of productivity within the industry and\nfirm. This shows the dispersion in productivity as\nmeasured by the ratio of productivity in the 90th to\nthe 10th percentile. As the sectors become more\ndisaggregated, the dispersion falls. The branches\nwithin the company are less dispersed than for the\nsector as a whole, but even at this quite disaggregated\nlevel productivity is still very dispersed. In 2003, the\nbranch at the 90th percentile was more than twice\nas productive as that at the 10th percentile in\nplumbing and 1.5 times as productive in building.\n(ii) How Do Establishments Move in the\nProductivity Distribution?\nAs we emphasized above, whether or not persistent\ndispersion in productivity is a cause for concern\ndepends on whether it is the same branches or firms\nthat are persistently poor performers, or whether\nindividuals move around the distribution. Consider\nthe analogy to the personal income distribution\u2014if\nsome people spend their whole life poor this may be\na cause for concern, whereas if everyone is poor for\na few years (say when they are students) but then\nmoves up the distribution, this is of much less\nconcern. How persistent is a branch\u2019s position in the\ncross-section productivity distribution over time?\n517\nR. Griffith, J. Haskel, and A.

This is set out in Figure 2.\nConsider the upper panel for Building. We take all\nbranches in the building division that exist in 2000\nand rank them by their position in the productivity\ndistribution in 2000. We then split the plants into ten\nequal size groups (deciles) and calculate the aver-\nage productivity of each decile. The graph then\nshows the average productivity, in each year, of the\nsame group of plants according to their membership\nin the initial year deciles. The graph shows that the\nranking of the plants is quite stable. The group of\nplants in the top decile, those who start with the\nFigure 2\nChanges in Position in the Productivity Distribution, by Company\n(a) Building\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n3.5\n4\n4.5\n2000 2001 2002 2003 2004\n1.5\n2.5\n3.5\n4.5\n5.5\n6.5\n7.5\n2000 2001 2002 2003 2004\nNote: These graphs show the following. We calculate margins per labour cost (sales less cost of bought-\nin goods divided by the wage bill) for every branch, and divide branches into 10 equal sized groups (deciles),\nwith the first group being those branches with the lowest value and the tenth group those with the highest\nvalues, according to the measure in 2000. Each line is the average of margins per labour cost for that group\nof branches, as it evolves over time. The top panel does this for all branches in the Building brand and the\nbottom for all in the Plumbing brand.\nSource: Company data.\n(b) Plumbing\n519\nR. Griffith, J. Haskel, and A. Neely\nFigure 3\nTransition Matrices, Productivity by Brand\nhighest average, ends up with the highest average\nproductivity, although slightly lower than where they\nstarted. The group in the lowest decile ends up still\nat the lowest point, but their average productivity\nhas risen. The middle groups tend to stay as they are,\nsuggesting that the position in the productivity distri-\nbution is quite persistent, but that neither the highest\nnor the lowest productivity levels are sustained; the\nhighest levels cannot be maintained and the lowest\nlevels improve towards the middle. The lower panel\nshows the same picture for Plumbing division and\nshows a similar pattern, although there is more\nconvergence.\nA second way to assess persistence is by looking at\ntransition matrices. Figure 3 sets these out in dia-\ngrammatic form.\nTo construct these we start by allocating all branches\nin the Building division to their productivity ranking\ndeciles in 2000.

We do this in 2000 and 2004. Zero in 2000 indicates branches that open between 2000 and 2004,\nzero in 2004 indicates branches that closed between 2000 and 2004.

For example, a firm\nin the top decile in 2000 which is also in the top decile\nin 2004 would be in the very top right-hand cell. In\nthe figure, the diameter of the dot corresponds to the\nnumber of firms in that cell. A zero in 2000 indicates\nthat the branch was opened after 2000, and a zero\nin 2004 indicates that the branch shut down before\n2004. As the figure shows, there is a concentration\nof branches (i.e. the widest dots) in the 10\/10 and 1\/\n1 cells, indicating that firms in the 10th and 1st decile\ntend to stay there. Indeed, there is somewhat of a\nconcentration of firms along the diagonal and near\ndiagonal, indicating persistence in performance.\nEntry and exit tend to be into and from the lowest\ndeciles.\nIt is slightly difficult to compare these results with\nothers, since other studies have mostly been for\nmanufacturing and have used labour productivity\ndata. Haskel and Martin (2002) look at gross output\nper person averaged over 3-year intervals for the\n1980 and 1990s in UK manufacturing, and find that\nnearly half of firms tend to stay where they are in the\nproductivity distribution. For example, 48 per cent of\nfirms who were in the bottom quintile of the produc-\ntivity distribution were still there 3 years later;\nlikewise 50 per cent of firms in the top quintile were\nstill there 3 years later.\nFinally, we can partition the variance of productivity\ninto that part that is due to branches having perma-\nnently different levels of productivity, and that part\nthat is due to productivity in individual branches\nfluctuating over time (around their own mean).\nThese two effects are commonly termed the \u2018be-\ntween variance\u2019 and \u2018within variance\u2019, respec-\ntively. In both divisions the between variation is\nabout twice the within variation. Thus, the bulk of\nthe variation in productivity is due to the fact that\nsome branches are permanently more productive\nthan other branches.\nIII. THE ROLE OF MANAGEMENT\nSo far we have shown that there is persistent\nvariation in productivity even when we compare\nvery similar branches where issues of measure\nerror are likely to be minimal. As we stated earlier,\nthere is potentially a large number of reasons why\nthis might be true. One reason that we are interested\nin investigating here is what role the management\nskills of the branch manager might play.\nBecause we are looking within a firm we cannot\ninvestigate the role of management overall. A few\npapers consider this. Bloom and Van Reenen (2006)\nuse a survey of company management practice\nwhere they ask a series of questions on practice,\neach requiring an answer on a scale of 1 to 5. They\nthen normalize the practice to mean zero and stand-\nard deviation one and take the unweighted average\nacross all normalized scores as the measure of\noverall managerial practice. Womack et al. (1990)\nand Oliver et al. (1996) compare the quality and\nproductivity performance of firms in the automotive\nindustry, arguing that performance variations can be\ntraced back to management practices and the adop-\ntion of lean-thinking principles.\nIn our study, an important question is how to meas-\nure the quality of management. A commonly used\nframework distinguishes between input, process,\nand outcome measures. Input measures include\nclassic measures of human capital, such as skill\nlevels, educational qualifications, attainment, and\nexperience. Process measures, such as those used\nby Bloom and Van Reenen (2006), focus on the\nmanagement processes used in the organization\u2014\ne.g. the extent to which targets are set, incentives\nare available, lean manufacturing methods are\nadopted, etc. Outcome measures focus on the\noutcomes of management\u2014e.g. customer satisfac-\ntion, employee satisfaction, operational perform-\nance, etc. Clearly, performance in terms of outcome\nmeasures cannot be attributed solely to manage-\nment, but for the purpose of this paper we assume\nthat management has significant influence over\nperformance outcomes. Hence we use a series of\nperformance-outcome measures as a proxy for\nmanagement, assuming that better performance in\nterms of outcomes is correlated with better man-\nagement.\nTo measure the performance of its branches the\nfirm has adopted a balanced scorecard (Kaplan and\nNorton, 1992). The balanced scorecard is a widely\nused measurement framework, which consists of\nfour perspectives\u2014financial, customer, internal, and\ninnovation and learning. In essence the balanced\nscorecard is designed to provide a \u2018balanced\u2019 view\nof an organization\u2019s performance by looking at it\n521\nR. Griffith, J. Haskel, and A. Neely\nfrom a variety of perspectives. Individual firms\nusing the balanced scorecard are encouraged to\nselect those performance measures that are most\nappropriate for their context. In this case the firm\ninvolved had 17 performance measures on its bal-\nanced scorecard. Together these 17 measures re-\nflect all of the important dimensions of performance\nfor the business. Six of the measures directly con-\ntain sales and\/or labour cost and so we exclude\nthese for the purpose of our calculations. The\nremaining 11 measures cover issues such as cus-\ntomer satisfaction, stock availability, and opera-\ntional standards (see Table 3). For each of these\nmeasures the firm has set targets. A traffic-light\nreporting system is used (green for excellent, amber\nfor acceptable, and red for unacceptable). To meas-\nure management performance we calculate how\nwell each individual branch performs against the\ntargets defined by the business. Hence, the best-\nperforming managers will operate in branches that\nare in the green zone for all of their measures, while\nthe worst-performing managers will operate in\nbranches that are in the red zone for all of their\nmeasures.\nFigure 4 shows a plot of the branch\u2019s average\nperformance on the 11 measures over the calendar\nyear 2003 against the branches\u2019 productivity per-\nformance over the same period. We see a clear\npositive correlation between the two.\nThis graph shows a correlation between two vari-\nables and not causation. It might be that managers\nare assigned to stores depending on store perform-\nance. Suppose, for example, the best managers are\nassigned to the worst-performing branches. Then\nwe would expect a negative relation (at first) be-\ntween management scores and performance, fol-\nlowed by a positive relation, but only for those\ninitially poorly performing branches. Thus in Figure\n5 we split branches into those that had higher than\nmedian productivity in the two preceding years\n(2000\u20131) and those that were below median. In both\ncases, we see a positive relationship here as well.\nHow do these data compare with other findings?\nBloom and Van Reenen (2006) control for other\nfactors besides management (capital, materials,\netc.) and find that a movement from the lower to the\nupper quartile of management scores between firms\n(0.971 points) is associated with an increase in TFP\nof around 5 per cent. In their actual data, the\ndifference in TFP between the lower quartile and\nupper quartile of the firms is 31.9 per cent. Hence\nmanagement \u2018accounts\u2019 for around 33 per cent of\ninter-quartile differences in their productivity meas-\nure. In our data, a movement of a firm from the\nlower to the upper quartile management scores\n(0.15 points) is associated with an increase in our\nproductivity measure of 0.32 points. The difference\nbetween the upper and lower quartile of productivity\nFigure 4\nManagement and Productivity\nNote: Each dot represents a branch.

This is remarkably close\nto the Bloom and van Reenen number. A few points\nare worth making. First, our measure of productivity\ndoes not correct for materials and capital in the way\nthat the Bloom study does. To the extent that better-\nmanaged firms have more capital, then we might\noverstate the fraction of (total factor) productivity\naccounted for by management. Second, our data\nare a much more like-for-like comparison of output\nthan the Bloom and Van Reenen (2006) sample. To\nthe extent that their cross-section comparison is\nobscured by comparisons of firms with different\nproducts, they might overstate the contribution of\nmanagement to TFP.6\nIV.

We argue this comparison is more of\na like-for-like comparison than other work since\ndifferent firms likely produce different goods. We\ndocument a persistent productivity spread, not un-\nlike that observed in the between-firm work. We\nthen relate this spread to management measures\nand find that the differences in management ac-\ncount for around 40 per cent of the observed\nproductivity spread. This correlation cannot, of\ncourse, inform us about the causal effect of man-\nagement on productivity, but it does suggest the\nrelation is worth further investigation.\nV. DATA APPENDIX\n(i) ARD Data\nThe ARD data are a sample of the business register,\nthe Interdepartmental Business Register (IDBR)\n(the register is a file of the addresses of all UK\nbusinesses, compiled using a combination of tax\nrecords, information lodged at Companies House,\nDun & Bradstreet data, and information built up\nfrom other surveys). The IDBR holds information\non the structure of the enterprise\/enterprise group,\ni.e. the addresses of the relevant enterprise and\nshops and their industries. It holds some employ-\nment and some output records. The Annual Busi-\nness Inquiry (ABI) is the annual survey on inputs\nand outputs and the ARD consists of the panel\nmicro-level information obtained from the ABI. To\nreduce compliance costs, however, the ABI is not a\ncensus of all shops. This is in two regards. First, an\nenterprise with many shops may decide to report\ninformation for a number of shops combined (a\n\u2018reporting unit\u2019). In practice, most reporting units\nare single-shop firms, but most employment is in\nfirms with many shops. These multi-shop firms\nusually report on the whole chain in one reporting\nunit. Second, all reporting units above a certain\nemployment (currently 250) are sent an ABI form.\nSmaller reporting units are sampled by size\u2013region\u2013\nindustry bands.7 To match the ARD data with the\ncompany data we use sales as defined in the ARD\nand sales less cost of bought-in goods. Note that the\nlatter is not value added as measured on the ARD,\nsince that also subtracts other intermediate inputs,\nsuch as heating and lighting, etc. Labour costs are\nmeasured in the ARD as wage bill plus employer\ntaxes. Employment usually refers to December and\nsales and costs data are typically for the calendar\nyear. We use the closest four-digit industry for\ncomparison with our chain-level data. However,\nit is important to note that the ARD data are by\nfirm, not by store. Thus productivity differences\nbetween firms likely mask differences between\nstores.\n525\nR. Griffith, J.
