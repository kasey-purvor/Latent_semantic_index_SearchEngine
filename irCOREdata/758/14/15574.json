Formal thought disorder (FTD) has long been regarded as a key sign of schizophrenia\nbut little is known about its origins or aetiology. One suggestion is that it is directly related\nto disordered language functioning; a second is that it is a re\ufb02ection of poor neurocognitive\nfunctioning. A current model posits that it is related to a combination of executive dysfunction and\nimpaired semantic processing.\nMethod. To examine these alternative ideas, a heterogeneous group of 30 patients, all carrying a\ndiagnosis of schizophrenia, and 18 non-patient controls completed a series of neurocognitive and\npsycholinguistic tests, and a clinical review that, inter alia, permitted assessment of thought disorder\n(TD) using the Thought, Language and Communication Scale (TLC).\nResults. Patients generally performed at a lower level on most components of the test battery, but\nthere was little evidence of a relationship between TD and syntactic psycholinguistic function.\nHowever, schizophrenic patients manifesting higher levels of TD performed at a lower level on tests\nsensitive to executive dysfunction and semantic impairments.\nConclusions. The origins of TD seem more closely linked to de\ufb01cits in executive func-\ntioning and semantic processing than to impairments in other language functions or general\ncognition.\nINTRODUCTION\nDisordered thinking and unusual patterns of\nspeech have come to be regarded by many\nas sine qua non of schizophrenia (Bleuler, 1950).\nClinically de\ufb01ned formal thought disorder\n(FTD), although relatively uncommon, is\ncertainly recognized as an important feature\nof the illness, but its origins, and even\nits precise nature, remain unclear. Early\nneuropsychological approaches characterized\nFTD as a manifestation of either impaired\nexecutivefunction(McGrath,1991;Anandetal.\n1994) or impaired linguistic function (Tamlyn\net al. 1992; Mortimer et al. 1995), although the\nevidence in support of these hypotheses is mixed\n(Kerns & Berenbaum, 2002).\nMore recently, Goldberg et al. (1998) and\nOh et al. (2002) have independently concluded\nthat thought disorder (TD) is related to rather\nspeci\ufb01c underlying semantic impairments. In\nthe former study, schizophrenic patients with\nhigher TD ratings evinced signs of impaired\n\u2018semantic e\ufb03ciency\u2019 (semantic \ufb02uency corrected\n* Address for correspondence: Dr John Stirling, Department of\nPsychology and Speech Pathology, Manchester Metropolitan\nUniversity, Hathersage Road, Manchester, M13 OJA, UK.\n(Email: j.stirling@mmu.ac.uk)\nPsychological Medicine, Page 1 of 10. f 2006 Cambridge University Press\ndoi:10.1017\/S0033291705006884 Printed in the United Kingdom\n1for phonological \ufb02uency) and word\u2013picture\nmatching (Peabody picture vocabulary test;\nDunn & Dunn, 1981). In the latter report, the\nauthors described six patients with marked TD\nwho di\ufb00ered from seven with little or no TD on\na range of tests designed to \u2018tap\u2019 receptive and\nexpressive semantic functions. Oh et al. (2002)\nobserved that, although poor performance on\ntheir test battery was associated with general\nintellectual impairment rather than TD per se,\npatients with marked TD nevertheless showed\nevidence of expressive semantic disturbances\nregardless of their level of general cognitive\nfunction.\nRodriguez-Ferrera et al. (2001) and Barrera\net al. (2005) have sought to clarify the relation-\nships between TD, neurocognitive and psycho-\nlinguistic functions. Schizophrenic patients with\nand without TD, and (in the Barrera et al.\nstudy) a non-patient control group, have been\nevaluated using a range of both semantic and\ncognitive\/executive function tests. In the former\nstudy, TD was associated with general intel-\nlectual impairment and semantic de\ufb01cits in\ncomprehension and picture description. In the\nlatter, higher TD patients were impaired on all\nmeasures of executive function but on only one\nof four semantic tests, in comparison to low\nTD patients and controls. Both studies there-\nfore provide strong support for a dysexecutive\nhypothesis of the origins of TD in schizophrenia\n(McGrath, 1991) and some additional evidence\nimplicating a higher-level semantic associative\nimpairment.\nAndreasen (1979) developed the Thought,\nLanguage and Communication Scale (TLC)\nas an objective, quantitative measure of TD,\npartly in response to long-standing concerns\nabout de\ufb01nitional clarity. Several of the\nstudies mentioned above (Goldberg et al. 1998;\nRodriguez-Ferrera et al. 2001; Oh et al. 2002)\nhave used the TLC to assess TD and we have\nfollowed suit. By recruiting a mixed group\nof schizophrenic patients to be assessed on\na battery of tests tapping frontal\/executive\nfunction, more general neurocognitive functions\nand syntactic and semantic psycholinguistic\nfunctions, our correlational approach enabled\nus to investigate the strength of relationship\nbetween TD and impaired neurocognitive\nand linguistic function in this heterogeneous\nsample.\nMETHOD\nParticipants\nThirty patients were recruited to take part in the\nstudy on the basis that they were considered by\ntheir psychiatrist to have schizophrenia; were\naged between 16 and 45 at the time of initial\ndiagnosis; and there was no evidence of current\ndrug misuse, organic brain disease, or marked\nintellectual de\ufb01cit. Information obtained from\ncase-note review, discussion with the patient\u2019s\npsychiatrist, and clinical interview was collated.\nComparisons with published guidelines con-\n\ufb01rmed that all patients met DSM-IV criteria\nfor schizophrenia (APA, 1994). Eight were in-\npatients on an acute ward of a hospital depart-\nment of psychiatry at the time of testing; three\nwere recruited from a day hospital; and 19\nattended the same hospital as out-patients.\nThe mean age of this group was 34.33 years\n(S.D.=10.39). There were 18 males and 12\nfemales. The average duration of treated illness\nwas 97 months. Twenty-eight of the 30 patients\nwere receiving neuroleptic medication at the\ntime of testing [average daily dose (CPZ equiv-\nalents): 573 mg].\nEighteen control subjects were recruited\nfrom among hospital and university personnel.\nThese individuals stated that they had not\npreviously had, or been treated for, psycho-\nlogical illness, and all responded negatively to\na series of screening questions compiled to\nidentify individuals with a current psychological\ndisorder. The mean age of this group was 36.22\nyears (S.D.=9.32).\nClinical assessments\nAll patients completed a detailed clinical inter-\nview lasting approximately 1 hour. From this it\nwas possible to rate participants in respect of\ncurrent symptomatology on the Positive and\nNegative Syndrome Scale (PANSS; Kay et al.\n1986) and the TLC. The former was used to\nderive a score of \u2018thought disturbance\u2019 and the\nlatter was scored in terms of total TD and global\nTD rating.\nNeuropsychological assessments\nAll respondents completed a battery comprising\nsemantic and syntactic psycholinguistic tests,\nmeasures of executive function and tests of more\ngeneral neurocognition, administered by A.B.,\n2 J. Stirling et al.usually within a day or two of the clinical\ninterview (in the case of patients). Order was\nstandardized to ensure best use of time, and\ntesting took approximately 90 minutes.\nSemantic tests\nGraded Naming Test (GNT)( McKenna\n& Warrington, 1983)\nThirty progressively more obscure (i.e. less\nfrequent) line drawings of animals and objects\nmust be identi\ufb01ed (named) by the respondent.\nThe Pyramids and Palm Trees Test (PPT)\n(Howard & Patterson, 1992)\nThis test comprises 52 triads of items, in which\none (shown at the top of the page) has to be\nmatched to one of the others (shown below).\nThis test assesses a person\u2019s ability to access\ndetailed semantic information from pictures.\nSpeed and Capacity of Language Processing\n(SCOLP)( Baddeley et al. 1992)\nThis test has two elements. The \u2018speed of\ncomprehension test\u2019 (silly sentences test)\ncomprises a series of grammatically correct\nstatements about the world, of which only half\nmake sense. The respondent assesses the validity\nof as many as possible within a 2-minute time\nperiod. The \u2018spot the word test\u2019 comprises\n60 word pairs; one a proper word and the\nother a nonsense word (e.g. violin\u2013broft). The\nrespondent must select the real word, guessing\nif necessary.\nSemantic \ufb02uency (Spreen & Benton, 1969) and\n\u2018semantic e\ufb03ciency\u2019( Goldberg et al. 1998)\nIn the semantic \ufb02uency test, the respondent\nproduces as many exemplars as possible of\nanimals, countries, and fruits (60 seconds for\neach category). A score of \u2018semantic e\ufb03ciency\u2019\n(retrieval of semantic knowledge from memory\ncorrected for the more executive task of\n\u2018phonological \ufb02uency\u2019; see below) is derived by\nsubtracting phonological \ufb02uency score from\nsemantic \ufb02uency score.\nThe Quick Test (QT)( Ammons & Ammons,\n1962)\nThis test is more commonly used as a proxy for\ncurrent IQ but does, in e\ufb00ect, \u2018tap\u2019 semantic\nmatching, and we have used it in this way.\nStandard instructions and procedure for form 1\nwere followed. Respondents see a card showing\nfour cartoon drawings. The tester reads from\na list of 50 words of increasing complexity and\nrespondents point to the picture most closely\nrelated to the word. The test is terminated\nif\/when the respondent makes six consecutive\nerrors.\nSyntactic tests\nTest for the Reception of Grammar (TROG)\n(Bishop, 1989)\nThis test measures the understanding of\ngrammatical constructs using 80 four-choice\nitems, for each of which the respondent selects a\npicture corresponding to the word or phrase\nspoken by the tester. It is divided into 20 four-\nitem blocks arranged in increasing di\ufb03culty.\nA block is only \u2018passed\u2019 if all four items have\nbeen correctly dealt with. A respondent\u2019s score\nis the number of blocks passed.\nToken test (DeRenzi & Vignolo, 1962)\nThis test measures the comprehension of com-\nmands varying in linguistic complexity. The test\nmaterials consist of circular and square shapes\nof various sizes and colours. The respondent has\nto follow commands ranging from simple ones\nsuch as \u2018Show me a circle\u2019, to more complex\nconditional ones such as \u2018If there is a black\ncircle pick up the red square\u2019. Performance is\nassessed in terms of the number of instructions\nfollowed correctly.\nReporter\u2019s test (DeRenzi & Ferrari, 1978)\nThis test measures expressive syntactic skills by\nrequiring the respondent to act as a \u2018reporter\u2019 of\nthe tester\u2019s actions (on the token test) in such a\nway that a third party could reproduce those\nactions exactly. The complexity of actions,\nand thus the speech required to accurately and\nsuccinctly describe them, increases to include\nup to six elements (e.g. \u2018Touch the large\nwhite square and the small yellow circle\u2019).\nPerformance is assessed in terms of accuracy\nin reporting the requisite actions.\nTests of executive function\nStroop test (Stroop, 1935)\nIn the word task, the respondent is shown a card\nwith the words BLUE, RED, GREEN,a n dTAN\nThought disorder in schizophrenia 3(printed in contrasting colours) arranged in four\n30-word columns, to be read as quickly as\npossible ignoring their colours. In the colour\ntask, a similar set of words is shown to the\nrespondent who must now identify the colour\nin which each word is printed. The Stroop e\ufb00ect\nis the di\ufb00erence (in seconds) between the times\nto complete the two tasks.\nTrail-making test (Reitan, 1958)\nIn form A, the respondent draws a line\n(as quickly as possible) to connect together, in\nascending order, 25 numbered circles scattered\napparently randomly on a single page. Form B\ncomprises 13 numbered circles (1 to 13) and\n12 lettered circles (A to L) scattered randomly\non a page, to be connected by a continuous line\nlinking 1 to A, 2 to B, 3 to C, and so on. The\nTrails score is the di\ufb00erence (in seconds) in\ncompleting tests A and B.\nDesign \ufb02uency (Jones-Gotman & Milner, 1977)\nThis tests \ufb02uency in a non-verbal mode. In\nthe \ufb01xed condition, respondents must generate\nas many di\ufb00erent designs as possible using\njust four lines (4 minutes allowed). In the\nfree condition, they should generate as many\ndrawings (doodles and nonsense drawings but\nnot scribbles or nameable geometric shapes)\nas possible in a 5-minute period. Fluency\nis assessed in terms of the total number of\nexemplars and the number of novel exemplars\nproduced.\nTower of London test (Shallice, 1982)\nThis test taps higher-level planning faculties, by\nrequiring respondents to move a set of three\ndi\ufb00erently coloured beads from a consistent\nstarting position on three short poles to a\nspeci\ufb01ed target pattern, in the minimum number\nof moves. Puzzles require between two and\n\ufb01ves moves for resolution. The more moves\nrequired, the greater the load placed on gener-\nation of, and search for, optimal solutions \u2013\nskills usually associated with frontal lobe\nfunction.\nPhonological \ufb02uency (Spreen & Benton, 1969)\nFor phonological \ufb02uency the respondent should\nproduce as many words as possible beginning\nwith the letters S, A, and F (60 seconds each).\nThis test is thought to depend on the integrity\nof the left frontal lobe. The score is the\ntotal number of words generated excluding\nrepetitions in 3 minutes.\nTests of more general cognitive function\nForward and reverse digit span (Wechsler, 1987)\nForward digit span assesses short-term mem-\nory. Respondents must repeat progressively\nlonger sequences of digits read aloud to them\nat a rate of one digit per second. Span is\nde\ufb01ned as the longest string of digits correctly\nrecalled at least once. Reverse span is admin-\nistered in similar fashion but respondents\nmust now reproduce the sequence in the re-\nverse of the presentation order. This task in-\nvolves manipulation of information as well\nas simple reiteration of it, and is often cited as\na measure of working memory (Stirling et al.\n1997).\nNational Adult Reading Test (NART)\n(Nelson & O\u2019Connell, 1978)\nThis test provides an estimate of pre-morbid\nIQ. Respondents attempt to read aloud from\na list of 50 words of increasing obscurity and\nnon-standard phonetic structure, typed on a\ncard. An error is recorded for each incorrect\npronunciation. Correct pronunciation depends\non prior encounter with the words, and in non-\nclinical samples is highly correlated with other\nmeasures of verbal IQ.\nRaven\u2019s Standard Progressive Matrices (RPM)\n(Raven, 1960)\nThe test comprises \ufb01ve sets of 12 problems, each\nconsisting of a pattern with part removed, and\nsix alternative parts, each of which \ufb01ts into\nthe space, but only one of which completes\nthe pattern. The respondent\u2019s non-verbal IQ is\ndetermined from the number of correctly solved\nproblems using standardized conversion tables.\nAn estimate of IQ decline was derived by\nsubtracting the RPM score from the NART\nscore.\nInformation processing speed (Coghlan, 1985)\nThe respondent works through a list of pairs\nof numbers; each pair comprising a four-\nand a \ufb01ve-digit number. The \ufb01ve-digit number\nis made up of the same four digits as the\n4 J. Stirling et al.\ufb01rst number, plus an extra digit, which the\nsubject has to identify. Four minutes is\nallowed, and the measure obtained (corrected\nfor motor speed) re\ufb02ects speed of information\nprocessing.\nData analysis\nAnalysis was undertaken using SPSS version\n12.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Data were\nreviewed for \u2018normality\u2019 and transformed if\nnecessary prior to analysis (tables show un-\ntransformed values). Patients and controls were\ncompared using a series of independent t tests.\nWithin the patient group, bivariate correlations\nwere calculated for total TD with both the\nneuropsychologicalandsemantic\/syntactictests.\nThese relationships were further explored in\na series of regression analyses setting total\nTD as the dependent variable and the tests in\nthe relevant four domains as independent vari-\nables.\nRESULTS\nComparison of patients and controls\nAge, IQ and IQ decline (Table 1)\nThere was no signi\ufb01cant di\ufb00erence between\ngroups in respect of age or estimated pre-\nmorbid IQ (NART). There was a signi\ufb01cant\ndi\ufb00erence in terms of current IQ (RPM) and in\nIQ decline (NART \u2013 RPM).\nNeurocognitive and executive function (Table 2)\nThese data provide evidence of a consistent\nand widespread de\ufb01cit in our patient group,\nwho performed at a signi\ufb01cantly lower level on\nour measures of \ufb02uency, information proces-\nsing, short-term memory and frontal\/executive\nfunction (Stroop e\ufb00ect, Trails B \u2013 A, Tower of\nLondon).\nSemantic and syntactic function (Table 3)\nThese data provide evidence of a generally\npoorer performance on all psycholinguistic\nTable 1.

However, signi\ufb01cant di\ufb00erences between\npatients and controls were limited to the re-\nporter and TROG tests, and both components\nof the SCOLP.\nRelationship between TD, neurocognitive and\npsycholinguistic pro\ufb01le and IQ within the\npatient group\n[Thought disturbance score derived from the\nPANSS (items P2, P3, P5 and G9 summed)\ncorrelated highly signi\ufb01cantly with TLC total\nTD score (r=0.733, p=0.001). Thus, to avoid\nduplication, the following analyses are restricted\nto TLC-derived scores.]\nIn the neurocognitive and executive domains,\ntotal TD correlated inversely with reverse digit\nspan (r=x0.407, p=0.026) and information\nprocessing speed (r=x0.401, p=0.028), posi-\ntively with both Trail tests (Trails A: r=0.528,\np=0.003; Trails B: r=0.543, p=0.002), and\ncrucially with the di\ufb00erence score between\nTrails A and B (r=0.432, p=0.017). Total TD\ncorrelated inversely with current IQ (RPM:\nr=x0.399, p=0.029), and also correlated\nsigni\ufb01cantly with three semantic tests \u2013 \ufb02uency\n(r=x0.502, p=0.005), GNT (r=x0.418,\np=0.21) and QT (r=x0.404, p=0.027).\nFollowing Goldberg et al. (1998) and\nin similar fashion to Barrera et al. (2005),\nwho used the Comprehensive Assessment of\nSymptoms (CASH; Andreasen, 1987) rather\nthan the TLC to derive TD scores, we divided\npatients into higher and lower TD groups on the\nbasis of whether their TLC (global) rating was\n2 or more (higher TD; n=11) or less than\n2 (lower\/absent TD; n=19). The higher TD\ngroup were poorer than the lower group on the\nTrails test (t=2.36, p=0.025), information\nspeed (t=2.29, p=0.029) and reverse digit span\n(t=2.55, p=0.017), and marginally poorer for\ndesign \ufb02uency novelty (t=1.91, p=0.06) and\nthe Stroop e\ufb00ect (t=2.00, p=0.055). In the\npsycholinguistic domain, the two groups dif-\nfered signi\ufb01cantly in respect of semantic \ufb02uency\n(t=3.05, p=0.006) and QT (t=2.34, p=0.03),\nbut not in respect of semantic e\ufb03ciency (sem-\nantic \ufb02uency \u2013 phonological \ufb02uency) or any of\nthe syntactic measures. These data are shown\nin Table 4.\nThe relationships between total TD and\nother variables were further examined using\nmultiple regression. Separate stepwise analyses\nwere computed, with total TD as the dependent\nvariable, for each domain of interest. In the\ngeneral neurocognitive domain, with forward\nand reverse digit span, current and pre-morbid\nIQ and information processing speed as inde-\npendent variables, reverse digit span emerged as\nthe only predictive variable (t=2.61, p=0.01).\nIn respect of executive function, with Trails\ndi\ufb00erence, Tower of London, design and\nphonological \ufb02uency and Stroop e\ufb00ect as inde-\npendent variables, Trails di\ufb00erence was the only\npredictive variable (t=2.32, p=0.03). In the\nsemantic domain, with GNT, PPT, semantic\n\ufb02uency, both elements of the SCOLP and QT as\nindependent variables, \ufb02uency was the best\/only\npredictor (t=2.73, p=0.01). Total TD was\nnot predicted by any of the syntactic psycho-\nlinguistic assessments.\nTable 3. Patients versus controls: semantic and syntactic functions\nPatients Controls\np valuea Mean (S.D.)

Stirling et al.Semantic de\ufb01cits in higher TD patients revisited\nTwo semantic tests, semantic \ufb02uency and QT,\ndi\ufb00erentiated patients scoring higher and lower\nfor TD (GNT did not, despite its correlation\nwith total TD.) We repeated these comparisons\nwith RPM (current IQ) as covariate. Somewhat\npredictably, the main e\ufb00ect for QT (itself a\nproxy for current verbal IQ) was rendered non-\nsigni\ufb01cant by this (F=0.51, N.S.). However, the\nmain e\ufb00ect for semantic \ufb02uency, though re-\nduced, remained signi\ufb01cant (F=4.85, df=1.27,\np=0.03). In fact this main e\ufb00ect also survived\nthe addition of phonological \ufb02uency as a second\ncovariate (F=5.10, df=1.26, p=0.03). These\nresults suggest that a semantic \ufb02uency de\ufb01cit in\nhigher TD patients is, to some extent, indepen-\ndent of current IQ or pure phonological \ufb02uency\nskills.\nMedication e\ufb00ects\nCorrelations between neuroleptic medication at\ntime of testing (converted into CPZ equivalent\ndosage) and each of our neuropsychological and\npsycholinguistic tests routinely failed to reach\nstatistical signi\ufb01cance. Comparison of the 10\npatients who were receiving anti-cholinergic\nmedication with the 20 who were not indicated\nthat the former group did less well on the\nreporter and speed of comprehension tests\n(t=2.30, p=0.03 and t=2.54, p=0.02 respect-\nively) and better on semantic \ufb02uency (t=2.14,\np=0.04).\nDISCUSSION\nAs expected, our data provide evidence of\nneurocognitive dysfunction among patients\nwith a diagnosis of schizophrenia, who also\nperformed at a signi\ufb01cantly lower level on four\npsycholinguistic measures, and evinced a wide\nrange of TD (total score range 0\u201322). Within\nthe cognitive and executive function domains,\nTD was inversely related to reverse digit span,\ninformation processing speed and current IQ,\nand positively correlated to time-to-complete\nboth Trails tests and to the di\ufb00erence between\nTrails B and A. Regression analyses identi\ufb01ed\nTrails di\ufb00erence and reverse digit span as the\nbest predictors of total TD. A particular role\nfor impaired frontal lobe functioning in TD\nhas been mooted by many authors (Harrow\n& Prossen, 1978; Frith, 1992; McGrath et al.\n1997; Barrera et al. 2005).

Additionally, semantic \ufb02uency (a test that\nassesses semantic and executive functions)\nwas the best of all the semantic and syntactic\n(psycholinguistic) measures at predicting TD.\nCoupled with the \ufb01ndings from the other\nmultiple regression analyses, executive dysfunc-\ntion, particularly that relating to failure to keep\n\u2018on track\u2019 or inhibit pre-potent responses, seems\nto be closely linked to increased levels of TD.\nIn the psycholinguistic domain, three sem-\nantic tests (GNT, QT and semantic \ufb02uency)\nbut none of the receptive\/expressive syntactic\ntests correlated with total TD. As mentioned\nabove, regression analyses indicated that \ufb02uency\nwas the only semantic or syntactic measure to\npredict TD. Prima facie, these \ufb01ndings provide\nadditional evidence for impaired naming (GNT)\nand semantic access (QT and \ufb02uency) in TD.\nHowever, \ufb02uency assesses both semantic and\nexecutive functions. When the latter is con-\ntrolled by subtracting phonological \ufb02uency\nperformance to produce an index of semantic\ne\ufb03ciency, the relationship to TD disappears; a\n\ufb01nding at odds with Goldberg et al. (1998).\nHowever, other researchers have raised ques-\ntions about the extent to which this derived\nmeasure may re\ufb02ect a characteristic of im-\npaired function in schizophrenia more generally\n(Gourovitch et al. 1996), or be related to symp-\ntoms other than TD (Rossell et al. 1999). We\nwould add that test scores based on di\ufb00erences\nare susceptible to \u2018initial value\u2019 e\ufb00ects and\nshould be treated with caution. [Goldberg et al.\ndo not provide details of uncorrected phono-\nlogical and semantic \ufb02uency rates.] With these\ncaveats in mind, we nevertheless note that our\nnegative \ufb01ndings in respect of this measure are\nconsistent with those of Barrera et al. (2005).\nGoldberg et al. and Barrera et al. indepen-\ndently concluded that \u2018higher level\u2019 semantic\nimpairments contribute towards TD partly on\nthe basis of the di\ufb00erential performance of\nhigher and lower TD patients on di\ufb00erent tests.\nWe concur with this overall view despite being\nunabletoreplicate the\ufb01ndingsofGoldbergetal.\nin respect of the SCOLP. Moreover, our higher\nTD patients could not be di\ufb00erentiated on the\nbasis of their performance on the PPT (a similar\nbut easier test than the Camels and Cactus test\nused by Barrera et al.), although high scoring in\nboth patients and controls suggests something\nof a ceiling e\ufb00ect for our cohort. However, our\ndata indicate that impaired semantic processing,\npossibly at the level of naming, but certainly in\nrelation to lexical access and \ufb02uency, is associ-\nated with higher levels of TD. Moreover, the\nobservation that semantic \ufb02uency di\ufb00erences\nsurvive covariance with both current IQ and\nphonological \ufb02uency strengthens the argument\nthat impaired semantic processing is a distinct\nfeature of TD and not simply a consequence of\nlow IQ or impaired phonological \ufb02uency.\nOur \ufb01ndings are thus broadly congruent with\na small but growing body of research evidence\nlinking TD in schizophrenia to a combination\nof executive dysfunction and circumscribed\nsemantic impairments related to, but possibly\nnot restricted to, access. Earlier studies (Anand\net al. 1994; Rodriguez-Ferrera & McKenna,\n1996) hinted at this relationship but were limited\nby the tests used and\/or other methodological\nconstraints. For instance, in the latter study, the\nauthors recorded measures of linguistic and\ngeneral cognition (though not executive func-\ntion) in TD patients, concluding that language\nimpairment (where it occurs in schizophrenia) is\nlikely to be a function of a generalized cognitive\nde\ufb01cit, which frequently characterizes the dis-\norder. However, in a further study (Rodriguez-\nFerrera et al. 2001) the same research group\nacknowledged that some patients appeared\nto have speci\ufb01c semantic impairments in the\nabsence of other general cognitive impairments\nthat were associated with TD.\nThe inclusion by Barrera et al. of a range\nof established measures of frontal\/executive\nfunction in addition to tests of semantic\nand syntactic function has further clari\ufb01ed\nthe neurocognitive signature of TD, and our\n\ufb01ndings reinforce the conclusions of these\nresearchers; namely, that higher levels of TD in\nschizophrenia are predicted by poor executive\nfunctioning and impaired semantic access, but\nnot by de\ufb01cits in syntactic processing. Semantic\n\ufb02uency is sub-served by a neural network\ncomprising the left (Pihlajamaki et al. 2000) and\nright (Billingsley et al. 2004) frontal lobe, and\nthe left medial temporal lobe, which is speci\ufb01-\ncally associated with access to semantic storage\n(Gourovitch et al. 2000). A positron emission\ntomography (PET) study of activations related\n8 J. Stirling et al.to speech production in thought-disordered\nschizophrenic patients (McGuire et al. 1998)\nsimilarly identi\ufb01ed cortical (inferior frontal\nand left superior temporal), cingulate and sub-\ncortical (right caudate) regions of irregular\nactivity associated with the production of\ndisordered speech. The idea of dysfunctional\nneuro-circuitry underpinning TD (and other\npsychotic symptom domains) has also been\nelaborated byJenningsetal.(1998),Spenceet al.\n(2000) and recently by Tamminga & Holcomb\n(2005), who concluded that the evidence points\n\u2018to problems of integration across regions\nrather than one speci\ufb01c regional abnormality\u2019\n(p. 31). Although no attempt was made in the\npresent study to delineate crucial neural sub-\nstrates of TD, our \ufb01ndings in respect of execu-\ntive and semantic dysfunctions are at least\nconsistent with a growing list of imaging studies\nin which \u2018functional disconnectivities\u2019 between\nfrontal, temporal and cingulate regions have\nbeen linked to TD.\nThe \ufb01ndings from the present study should\nbe considered in light of several intrinsic\nmethodological limitations. First, in deliberately\nopting for \u2018breadth of coverage\u2019 in the selection\nof tests, rather than focusing on performance\non a small number of tests in a large sample, our\nstudy is underpowered. Second, the absence\nof signi\ufb01cant di\ufb00erences between patients and\ncontrols on several of the language tests suggests\neither that our patients were not particularly\nimpaired or that our tests were not su\ufb03ciently\nsensitive. Third, in common with many other\nstudies of neurocognition in schizophrenia,\nthere is, in the present study, the possibility of\na recruitment bias stemming from the fairly\ndemanding nature of some of the tests in\nour battery, with some patients possibly being\njudged as \u2018not competent to complete\u2019 them.\nAdditionally, discrepancies remain between\nour \ufb01ndings and those of Goldberg et al.,\nRodriguez-Ferrera et al. and Barrera et al. that\nwe are, at present, obliged to account for in\nterms of the idiosyncrasies of patient recruit-\nment and extraneous variables related to test\nselection and procedures, and that certainly\nmerit further careful investigation.\nIn summary, our data provide scant evidence\nthat TD in schizophrenia is directly related to\ngeneralized impaired language functioning. TD\nwas not associated with \u2018semantic ine\ufb03ciency\u2019,\nor with any of our syntactic measures. However,\nit was associated with impaired performance\non several neurocognitive tests, some of which\n\u2018tap\u2019 frontal lobe function, and on semantic\ntests of naming, access and \ufb02uency, the latter\nof which relies on a combination of executive\ncontrol and semantic access. Further investi-\ngation of the relative contributions of executive\nand semantic impairments to TD in schizo-\nphrenia is thus warranted.\nDECLARATION OF INTEREST\nNone.\nREFERENCES\nAmmons, R.
