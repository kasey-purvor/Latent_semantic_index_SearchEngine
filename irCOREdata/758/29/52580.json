Our calculations show 21 \nthat, in all cases, the inclusion of uni-molecular isomerisations of the isoprene hydroxy peroxy 22 \nradicals leads to enhanced production of HOx radicals and ozone. The global burden of ozone 23 \nincreases by 25-36 Tg (8-18%), depending on the climate\/emissions scenario, whilst the changes in 24 \nOH lead to decreases in the methane lifetime of between 11% in the futureand 35% in the pre-25 \nindustrial.

However, the updated chemistry could have far-reaching implications for: future-29 \nclimate predictions; projections of future oxidising capacity; and our understanding of past changes 30 \nin oxidising capacity.   31 \n 32 \n 33 \n1.0: Introduction. 34 \nIsoprene (2-methyl-1,3-butadiene) emissions comprise a major fraction of total biogenic volatile 35 \norganic compound (BVOC) emissions. Field and modelling studies estimate that the natural 36 \nemissions of isoprene have been fairly constant over the last decade or so, ~400-500 Tg C\/yr 37 \n[M\u00fcller et al., 2008]. Owing to the high reactivity of isoprene towards the hydroxyl radical (OH), 38 \nmodel studies invariably implicate isoprene as a large sink of OH. However, the reactive products 39 \nformed from the oxidation of isoprene by OH, the isoprene hydroxy-peroxy radicals (ISOPOHO2), 40 \ncan interact with oxides of nitrogen (NOx = NO+NO2) resulting in production of ozone in the 41 \ntroposphere\u2015the main OH precursor.  42 \nRecent field studies in major isoprene emitting regions such as Amazonia [Lelieveld et al., 2008] 43 \nand South East Asia [Hewitt et al., 2010] have found large discrepancies between modelled and 44 \nmeasured HOx concentrations. These discrepancies are not confined to the tropics, but coincide with 45 \nregions impacted by isoprene emissions [Hofzumahaus et al., 2009; Tan et al., 2001]. The model-46 \nmeasurement disagreement is most pronounced where high isoprene concentrations (> 1 ppbv) 47 \ncoincide with low NOx concentrations (< 1 ppbv). Several theoretical [Peeters et al., 2009; Peeters 48 \nand M\u00fcller 2010; da Silva et al., 2010] and experimental [Paulot et al., 2009] studies have recently 49 \nprovided new insights into the oxidation mechanism of isoprene. No doubt, more studies will be 50 \nrequired to unravel its intricacies. However, the work of Peeters et al. [2009] concerning 51 \nunimolecular reactions of  ISOPOHO2, has been shown in both box model [Archibald et al., 2010] 52 \n3 \n \nand global models [Archibald et al., 2010; Stavrakou et al., 2010] to improve the representation of 53 \nlow-NOx isoprene chemistry.  54 \n 55 \nWe use the UKCA global chemistry-climate model (http:\/\/www.ukca.ac.uk) to explore the impact of 56 \nincluding isomerisation reactions of ISOPOHO2 on the composition of the atmosphere in the 57 \npresent (2000), pre-industrial (ca. 1850) and future (2100). There exists a great deal of work in the 58 \nliterature about the importance of isoprene oxidation in global chemistry [e.g. Wang and Shallcross, 59 \n2000], and more recently, a great deal of debate towards the issues of reconciling problems with 60 \nrepresenting its chemistry in global models [Lelieveld et al., 2008; Archibald et al., 2010; Stavrakou 61 \net al., 2010]. There are likely to be modifications to the mechanism of isoprene oxidation as time 62 \nprogresses, but this work investigates the most important aspect that has been thus far poorly 63 \nrepresented \u2013 the regeneration of HOx radicals through isomerisation reactions of ISOPOHO2.  64 \n 65 \n 66 \n2.0: Method. 67 \nA number of experiments with the UKCA model, run at a horizontal resolution of 3.75\u00ba in longitude 68 \n\u00d7 2.5\u00ba in latitude on 60 hybrid height levels that stretch from the surface to ~84 km, where carried 69 \nout. The model set up is similar to that described in Telford et al. [2010], with a chemical 70 \nmechanism comprising 60 chemical tracers and 132 photochemical reactions, including the 71 \noxidation of isoprene based on the Mainz Isoprene Mechanism [P\u00f6schl et al., 2000]. The model\u2019s 72 \ndynamical core is based on the Met Office's Unified Model version 6.1. In each experiment, the 73 \nmodel is allowed to run freely with the climate forced by specified concentrations of long-lived 74 \ngreenhouse gases and ozone-depleting substances, in addition to prescribed sea surface 75 \ntemperatures and sea-ice coverage from the HadISST dataset [Rayner et al., 2003]. Stratospheric 76 \nchemistry is not calculated explicitly. Instead, the concentrations of ozone and NOy above 30 hPa 77 \nare taken from the Cambridge 2D model [Law and Pyle, 1993] and are not changed between 78 \n4 \n \nexperiments, so that the influence of the stratosphere on the troposphere remains constant. The 79 \nresults are taken from three-year integrations following an 18 month \u2018spin-up\u2019 period.  80 \n 81 \nOur modifications to the isoprene mechanism follows that applied in the global model STOCHEM, 82 \nin the study of Archibald et al. [2010] (their reactions R24-R26). However, the representation used 83 \nin this study differs somewhat from Archibald et al. [2010] as we omit the formation of the 84 \n(predicted) highly photolabile hydroperoxy-aldehyde (HPALD) and instead assume prompt 85 \nformation of OH from both isomerisations of the ISOPOHO2. The two reaction pathways are 86 \nrepresented by Eq. 1 and 2 (k1 = 4.0\u00d710-3 s-1; k2 = 8.0\u00d710-2 s-1; MACR=lumped C4 carbonyl; 87 \nMGLY=methyl glyoxal; HACET=hydroxyacetone). The product yields were determined by running 88 \na series of box model experiments and optimising the product yields to give a reasonable match to 89 \nthe results of Mechanism 4 of Archibald et al. [2010] for HOx, ozone and CO. The values used for 90 \nk1 and k2 come from Archibald et al. [2010], derived for conditions appropriate for the tropics. Both 91 \nk1 and k2 are predicted to have significant temperature dependence (Peeters and M\u00fcller [2010] 92 \npredict variations of up to a factor of 3 for a 10 K change in temperature). However, owing to the 93 \nfact that most isoprene is oxidised in the tropics (near the surface) where there is small variation in 94 \ntemperature, it is expected that this simplification should have only a relatively small impact on the 95 \nresults.  96 \n 97 \nISOPOHO2 \u2192 OH + MACR + HCHO       (Eq 1) 98 \nISOPOHO2 \u2192 1.0\u00d7HO2 + 1.0\u00d7MGLY + 0.65\u00d7HACET + 0.6\u00d7OH   (Eq 2) 99 \n 100 \nSix experiments where carried out: a Base run (B) and a Modified run (M; including the 101 \nisomerisation reactions of ISOPOHO2) each subject to Present-Day (PD), Pre-Industrial (PI) and 102 \nFuture (FC) climate\/emissions scenarios (see Table 1 for a breakdown of the emissions), based on 103 \nthe emissions of Stevenson et al. [2006], Lamarque et al. [2010] and Dentener et al. [2005] 104 \n5 \n \nrespectively. The future emissions reflect the IPCC B2+CLE scenario. Note the relatively similar 105 \ntotal BVOC emissions, but much lower total NOx emissions, in the pre-industrial, compared with 106 \nthe present. In all cases the amount of CH4 is prescribed (Table 1). In each period, we assessed the 107 \nimpact of the updated isoprene scheme in terms of absolute differences (i.e. M-B) and percentage 108 \ndifferences (i.e. 100\u00d7((M\u2013B)\/B)). We assessed the changes in the troposphere only and define this 109 \nlayer based on the lapse rate. 110 \n 111 \n3.0: Results. 112 \n 113 \n3.1: Present day. 114 \nIn general our base present-day simulation (PD-B) generates results for ozone and CO that are 115 \nconsistent with a wide range of observations and compare well with other global models (Fig 1) 116 \n[c.f. Stevenson et al., 2006; Shindell et al., 2006]. A comparison against ozone-sonde measurements 117 \nis shown in Fig 1a (PD-B indicated by red line and pink envelope). In general, and in line with the 118 \nmajority of models [e.g. Shindell et al., 2006], the PD-B simulation tends to under-predict CO in the 119 \nNorthern Hemisphere and slightly over predict CO in the Southern Hemisphere (red line in Fig 1b).  120 \nIncluding the ISOPOHO2 isomerisation reactions (PD-M, indicated by blue line and purple 121 \nenvelope in Fig 1a) leads to an improvement in the comparison with ozone for almost all latitude 122 \nand pressure bands (the exception being Equator-30\u00baN, 750hPa). Likewise, there is improved 123 \nsimulation of CO and the SH high bias is slightly reduced in the PD-M simulation (blue line in Fig 124 \n1b). The levels of OH and HO2 are enhanced by as much as 410% and 225% respectively in certain 125 \nregions at the surface and up to 75% in the zonal mean (Fig 2). These enhancements are 126 \napproaching those needed to reproduce the high concentrations of OH and HO2 measured in the 127 \ntropics [Lelieveld et al., 2008]. Note that the greatest increases in OH are mainly limited to surface 128 \nregions in the tropics, where there are high emissions of isoprene but low emissions of NOx.  Fig 2d 129 \nclearly shows that surface increases are propagated throughout the tropical free troposphere. These 130 \n6 \n \nincreases in the free troposphere are driven by convection in the tropics lifting the products of 131 \nisoprene oxidation (such as MGLY in Eq 2) to higher altitudes where rapid photolysis allows 132 \nenhanced production of HO2. In our parameterisation of the products of the ISOPOHO2 133 \nisomerisation\u2019s MGLY is included as a major product. Our PD-M simulation tends to predict 134 \nconcentrations of MGLY which are comparable but higher (around a factor of two) than those 135 \nreported by Fu et al. [2008]. The exact products following ISOPOHO2 isomerisation\u2019s are in need 136 \nof experimental verification. However, our representation of them as small oxidised compounds 137 \nknown to be associated with isoprene oxidation should, to first order, have only a small effect on the 138 \nresults. 139 \n 140 \nIn Fig 1c we compare modelled and measured OH and HO2+RO2 made during the OP3 campaign in 141 \nBorneo [Hewitt et al., 2010]. The PD-M simulation (blue line) clearly improves the comparison 142 \nbetween modelled and measured OH. Reducing the rate of the ISOPOHO2 isomerisation\u2019s by a 143 \nfactor of two (green lines) leads to a very small decrease in the OH enhancement compared with the 144 \nPD-M run. However, it is apparent from analysis of the HO2+RO2 data that some form of parameter 145 \nrefinement is needed as the PD-M mechanism over simulates the amount of HO2+RO2 by more than 146 \na factor of two. We note that this is not unique to our implementation of the Peeters\u2019 mechanism; 147 \nboth Stavrakou et al. [2010] and Whalley et al. [2011 in prep] also present results that show an over-148 \nsimulation of HO2 relative to OH. Globally, the amount of OH in the troposphere increases 149 \nsignificantly (Table 2) leading to a decrease in the lifetime of methane, of around 14%. The amount 150 \nof ozone also increases by some 25 Tg (8%) globally. This is driven by a reduction in the flux of 151 \nozonolysis and by an increase in the flux through the reaction between HO2 and NO. The level of 152 \nenhancement in HOx in the present study is much greater than that reported by Archibald et al. 153 \n[2010] where at most they calculated increases of ~50%. This can be attributed to an overestimation 154 \nin that study of NOx in isoprene rich areas, with the present results being more in line with the work 155 \nof Peeters and M\u00fcller [2010] and Stavrakou et al. [2010].  156 \n7 \n \n 157 \n 158 \n3.2: Pre-industrial. 159 \nAs in previous studies [Mickley et al., 2001; Lamarque et al., 2005], our base pre-industrial 160 \ncalculations (PI-B) cannot reproduce the very low concentrations of surface ozone measured at the 161 \nturn of the 20th century using the Schonbein method [Pavelin et al., 1999]. Mickley et al. [2001] 162 \nsuggested this could be the result of an overestimation of NOx emissions at that time. They also 163 \npostulated that increased emissions of reactive BVOCs could contribute, although Lamarque et al. 164 \n[2005] have subsequently argued that this would be inconsistent with our best estimates of PI 165 \nemissions. More recently, Pavalla et al. [2010] have reported that the inclusion of tropospheric 166 \nhalogen chemistry can help to resolve this. 167 \n 168 \nLike Mickley et al. [2001], we find that the combination of low levels of NOx and the propensity for 169 \nisoprene to react with OH leads to near titration of OH in much of the continental boundary layer in 170 \nthe tropics and mid-latitudes in our PI-B experiment. When we include the updates to the chemistry 171 \n(PI-M), as with the present-day, we calculate significant enhancements in OH and HO2, but in the 172 \npre-industrial this is to a much greater extent owing to the lower levels of NOx. We calculate 173 \nenhancements in OH approaching 1500% in some regions at the surface, and 170% in the zonal 174 \nmean (in the tropics near the surface, see Fig 2); HO2 is enhanced by as much as 300% at the 175 \nsurface and 75% in the zonal mean. Enhanced destruction of CO in the boundary layer leads to 176 \nlower levels of CO, and higher levels of OH, throughout much of the troposphere.  Globally, the 177 \nincrease in OH leads to a 35% reduction in the lifetime of methane\u2015a very substantial 178 \ndecrease\u2015whilst we calculate an increase in global ozone burden of 36 Tg (18%). 179 \n 180 \n 181 \n3.3: Future. 182 \n8 \n \nWe explored a reasonably optimistic future-emissions scenario (IPCC B2+CLE), in which NOx 183 \nemissions decrease but VOC emissions increase. We note that the increased emissions of isoprene 184 \ndo not reflect the important role that CO2 inhibition may play in a CO2-warmed future [Young et al., 185 \n2009]. The results of the base simulation (FC-B) are generally similar to the PD-B simulation, 186 \nalthough we simulate an increase in ozone of ~32 Tg. Similarly, on updating the chemistry (FC-M) 187 \nwe calculate enhancements in OH and HO2 of as much as 550% and 200% respectively at the 188 \nsurface and greater than 75% for OH in the tropics near the surface as a zonal mean (see Fig 2). The 189 \nincreased HOx then leads to further increases in ozone burden (32 Tg or ~9%) and a significant 190 \nreduction in the lifetime of methane of ~11%.   191 \n 192 \n4.0: Discussion and conclusions. 193 \nImplementing updated (low NOx) chemistry for isoprene has led to large increases in modelled HOx 194 \nconcentrations. These increases are largest within the boundary layer in regions where NOx 195 \nconcentrations are low and isoprene concentrations are high. These areas are predominantly found 196 \nin the tropics. Deep convection in these areas lifts the products of isoprene oxidation into the free 197 \ntroposphere and promotes ozone production (mainly through an increase in the reaction between 198 \nHO2 and NO). Ultimately, the modified isoprene chemistry is sensitive to the chemical environment 199 \nwhich can be characterised on a global scale by the ratio of VOC\/NOx emissions. Characterising the 200 \nglobal effects of this modified chemistry by comparing relative changes in the methane lifetime 201 \nshows that there is a tailing off in the importance of the effect, from the pre-industrial to a warmer, 202 \n\u201ccleaner\u201d future. However, the importance of understanding the evolution in atmospheric 203 \ncomposition should not be underestimated.  The changes in ozone burden (Table 2) (and to a lesser 204 \nextent methane lifetime) have bearings on future-climate predictions, owing to the radiative-forcing 205 \nproperties of these greenhouse gases, whilst the changes in methane lifetime have consequences for 206 \nprojections of future oxidising capacity, and our understanding of past changes in oxidising 207 \ncapacity\u2015an area we intend to explore further.  The Peeters mechanism [Peeters et al., 2009] is 208 \n9 \n \nunlikely to be the last word on the subject but its contribution to our understanding of the chemistry 209 \nsurrounding isoprene oxidation at low-NOx concentrations has potentially far-reaching implications. 210 \nThese warrant further study and validation via model-measurement comparison and crucially 211 \ntargeted laboratory experiments aimed at simulating the conditions encountered in the tropical 212 \nboundary layer. 213 \n 214 \n 215 \nAcknowledgments. 216 \nWe thank two anonymous referees for their comments of the original manuscript.
