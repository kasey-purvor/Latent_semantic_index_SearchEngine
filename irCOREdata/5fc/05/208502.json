All \nerrors are mine, of course. \n2 \n \nIntroduction \nThis short research note addresses a topic that has been neglected in the literature \nso far. The topic is whether and to what extent pressure on the environment in the \n15 countries that currently form the European Union (EU) has decreased and, \nmore interestingly, whether this pressure has converged among these countries. \nConvergence is defined here as a narrowing of the variation in the pressure among \nthe relevant countries. \nWhy would one expect decreasing pressure on the environment in EU \ncountries? The answer lies in a combination of policy and economics. On the \npolicy side, increasingly stringent environmental regulations both at the national \nas well as at the Community level should lead to reduced pressure. To appreciate \nthe changes in policies compare the situation in the early and mid-1980s, the \nstarting point of the empirical evidence reported further below, with the one in the \nmid-1990s, the end period of this evidence. In the early 1980s, many of the \ncountries that now form the EU, even the pioneering ones, had just begun to \ninstall the institutional framework in which environmental policies started to \nbecome developed (Andersen and Liefferink 1997; Hanf and Jansen 1998). On the \nCommunity level, the more comprehensive and ambitious Third, Fourth and \nparticularly the Fifth Environmental Action Programme were still to come. In the \nmid-1990s, on the other hand, all countries were engaged in more comprehensive \nenvironmental policies based on an established institutional infrastructure and the \nCommunity was about to set up unprecedented progressive environmental \nprovisions in the Treaty Establishing the European Community (Barnes and \nBarnes 1999; Kr\u00e4mer 1998; Neumayer 2001). On the economic side, secular \n3 \ntechnological improvements, rising resource productivity, as well as sectoral \nchanges towards a less polluting service economy should have further reduced \npressures. The economic and the policy side are inter-linked in many ways, of \ncourse. One important link is that it is often argued that higher income levels \nfoster post-materialist attitudes among the population and strengthen preferences \nfor environmental protection measures (Inglehart 1995). These developments, in \nturn, will put pressure on policy makers to enact strong environmental policies to \ncounteract the increased pressure that rising levels of economic development \nwould otherwise bring about. \nPerhaps more interesting is the question why one would expect convergence in \npressure on the environment among EU countries. To start with, one would expect \nsuch convergence because levels of economic development as well as primary \nenergy use, the main drivers of pressure on the environment, in particular with \nrespect to air pollution, have slightly converged as we will see later on. Second, \nthe emergence of environmental regulation at the Community level should have \nhad a converging effect on environmental pressure.1 The tremendous change in \nthe role environmental policy at the Community level plays is nicely summarised \nby Weale et al. (2000, p. 137) as follows: \u2018In the space of two decades, \nenvironmental protection has developed within the EU from an unacknowledged \nand peripheral sector of public policy to one of the central components in the \nstrategy for European integration.\u2019 Third, the fundamental processes of economic \ninternationalisation and globalisation together with the enhanced economic \n                                                 \n1\n Of course, some of the currently 15 member countries joined the EU after the early 1980s, the \nbeginning of our empirical assessment. However, after accession (and often even before) they had \nto take over Community legislation within a rather short period of time. \n4 \nintegration in the quest for a Single Market make the EU member countries\u2019 \neconomies converge, which, all other things equal, should have a converging \neffect on pressure on the environment as well. On the other hand, bureaucratic and \nother inertia within countries can provide a powerful force maintaining \ndivergence, given that most environmental measures need to be implemented and \nenforced by the individual member states. \nFor the reasons set out above, one might expect pressure on the environment \nto decrease over time and to converge in EU countries. Maybe somewhat \nsurprisingly, however, convergence in pressure on the environment has, to the \nbest of my knowledge, never been empirically assessed. What has been assessed \nand found evidence for is convergence of income levels and other quality of life \nindicators (see, for example, Giannia, Liargova and Manolas 1999) as well as \nconvergence in environmental governance, that is in administration styles, \ninstrument choice and policy formulation (Fern\u00e1ndez 1994; Heritier 1995; \nLenschow 1997; Weale et al. 1996, 2000). It is the objective of this research note \nto start filling this gap with respect to pressure on the environment. \n \nI. Methodology \nWhat is pressure on the environment? It stems from the emission of pollutants that \nhave the potential to reduce the quantity and quality of environmental resources as \nwell as harm human health. Of course, there are a great many different pressures \nand ideally one would want to address them all. Unfortunately, data availability \ndoes not allow this. Lack of data availability also means that we cannot address \nother potential environmental indicators such as ambient environmental quality \nindicators or ecological vulnerability indicators. In this article, we will therefore \n5 \nhave to confine ourselves to a relatively small sample of emission output \nindicators for which time-series cross-sectional data are available: \n \n\u2022 Sulphur oxides (SOx), which damage human health and cause acid rain, which \ndamages buildings, aquatic ecosystems and agriculture. \n\u2022 Nitrogen oxides (NOx), which contribute to the production of smog and acid \nrain. \n\u2022 Volatile organic compounds (VOC), which play an important role in the \nproduction of photochemical oxidants. \n\u2022 Carbon monoxide (CO), which decreases the absorption of oxygen by red \nblood cells. \n\u2022 Carbon dioxide (CO2), which is the major greenhouse gas causing global \nwarming. \n\u2022 Organic water pollutants, measured as biochemical oxygen demand, referring \nto the amount of oxygen that bacteria in water will consume in breaking down \nwaste. Organic water pollutants are a major cause for water quality \ndegradation. \n\u2022 Consumption of fertilisers, which can have negative effects on the quality of \nwater, including drinking water. \n\u2022 Consumption of pesticides, which can damage wildlife and human health. \n \nAs can be seen, most of the pressures looked at here cause air and water \npollution. They are also the environmental problem areas that were targeted by \nmost EU countries early on before other areas such as soil protection and \nchemicals regulation became tackled (Weale et al. 2000, p. 141). This is fortunate \n6 \nas convergence, if existent, should be most clearly visible in areas tackled early \non. \nHow can one compare pressure on the environment in different countries \ngiven that population size and the size of the economy differ quite dramatically? \nWe will use two different ways here to make pressure comparable: we will look at \npressure per capita as well as pressure per unit of gross domestic product (GDP). \nIn assessing whether pressure has decreased over time, we will look at the simple \naverage of pressure among EU countries. We will not look at an average weighted \nby population or economy size since we are interested in how pressure in inter-\ncountry comparison has developed rather than in how \u201crepresentative\u201d pressure \nwithin the EU has developed. \nIn assessing whether there has been convergence in pressure, we look at the \nso-called coefficient of variation (COV). This coefficient is defined as  \n \nwhere N is the number of countries, Xi is the relevant data entry of country i for \npressure X, and X is its arithmetic mean. Note that the numerator is nothing else \nbut the standard deviation. In some cases limited data availability means that N is \nbelow 15, the current number of EU member countries. \nNote that the COV is independent of the unit of measurement used and \n\u201cnormalised\u201d in dividing the standard deviation by the mean. It can therefore be \nused to compare the variability of data measured in the same unit, but with \ndifferent means, as well as data measured in different units. It is often expressed \nin percentage terms, where 0% would imply no variability. \nCOV N\nX X\nX\ni\ni\nN\n=\n\u2212\n=\n\u2211\n1 2\n1\n( )\n7 \nTo reduce data gaps, we use three year averages, which ideally is the simple \naverage of the data from the relevant three years. However, if data was only \navailable for two out of the three years, then their average was taken. If data was \navailable for one year only, then that year\u2019s data was taken for the whole three \nyear period. While this method introduces some bias into the results, there is no \nreason to presume that it would have any systematic impact upon our questions of \nconcern here. For some indicators, data were available from 1980 onwards to \n1997. However, for most indicators the covered period is 1985 to 1996. Most data \non environmental indicators stem from OECD (1999), with the exception of \ncarbon dioxide emissions, which are taken from Marland, Boden and Andres \n(2000), primary energy use data, taken from British Petroleum (1993, 2000), and \norganic water pollution, taken from World Bank (2000). Data on population size \nas well as (real) GDP per capita in purchasing power parity are also taken from \nWorld Bank (2000). \n \nII. Results \nTable 1 shows time trends in the COV as well as the mean for real GDP per capita \nas well as primary energy use, measured on a per capita as well as per unit of \nGDP basis. Note that in the case of GDP per capita N is equal to 14 as \nLuxembourg has been taken out. This small country, more a wealthy city than a \ncountry compared to the rest of member countries, represents a strong outlier in \nthe sense that it has had extra-ordinary growth in income levels despite an already \nhigh initial income level. If Luxembourg is included then there is little \nconvergence apparent, but given its size and its particular characteristics, its \n8 \ninclusion would mask the fact of convergence in level of economic development \nwithin the EU. \n \n< INSERT TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE > \n \nLooking at the COV and the mean of GDP per capita we see both a dramatic \nincrease in average income levels as well as convergence, which can be seen by \nthe decrease in the COV over time. In both senses, the EU really represents a \nsuccess story, where its member countries have achieved \u2018the strengthening and \nconvergence of their economies\u2019 as currently proclaimed in the Preamble to the \nTreaty on European Union. \nTable 1 also shows that primary energy use per unit of GDP has slightly \ndecreased and converged among EU countries.2 This decrease in energy intensity \nof GDP has not been enough to decrease levels of primary energy use per capita, \nhowever, which has constantly increased due to strong economic growth, that is \nincreases in GDP. Convergence is slightly more pronounced if primary energy use \nis measured on a per capita basis. As the level of economic development and \nprimary energy use are important drivers of pressure on the environment, all other \nthings equal one would expect some convergence in pressure as well. \nTurning to indicators of pressure on the environment we see an altogether \ndifferent picture, however, as far as convergence is concerned.3 Table 2 shows \ntime trends in the COV as well as the mean for emissions of sulphur oxides (SOx), \n                                                 \n2\n Note that N is equal to 14 as the source provides primary energy data for Belgium and \nLuxembourg taken together. \n9 \nnitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOC), carbon monoxide \n(CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), organic water pollutants as well as consumption of \npesticides and fertilisers, all on a per capita basis. While mean pressure has \ndecreased throughout (or stagnated in the case of CO2), there is very little \nconvergence in pressure apparent. In some cases such as SOx emissions and \nfertiliser consumption, we actually observe divergence! \n \n< INSERT TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE > \n \nAnother interesting observation is that the variation in pressure on the \nenvironment is above the variation in GDP as well as, for some pressures at least, \nabove the variation in primary energy use. This can be seen by the fact that the \nCOV for all pressure indicators is higher than the COV of GDP and is suggestive \nof substantial cross-country differences in the strictness of the regulation of these \npressures. \nThe same basic picture holds true if we look at these indicators in terms of per \nunit of GDP rather than per capita (see table 3).4 Note that this table does not \nshow pesticide and fertiliser consumption per unit of GDP as these would not \nmake much sense as indicators of pressure on the environment. Also note that CO \nemissions and CO2 emissions appear twice, once in the full sample, the other time \nin a sample where Luxembourg has been excluded. This is because of the special \ninfluence of Luxembourg on GDP based measures already noted above. For all \n                                                                                                                                     \n3\n Note that the covered time period differs for two indicators from the rest due to better data \navailability. \n10 \nother indicators the exclusion of Luxembourg does not make much difference so \nthat merely the full sample case is reported. \n \n< INSERT TABLE 3 ABOUT HERE > \n \nLooking at table 3, we see that throughout mean pressure is decreasing with \nlittle convergence apparent and divergence emerges again in the case of SOx \nemissions and fertiliser consumption. The only exception is CO2 emissions, which \nshow a clear converging trend if measured per unit of GDP in the full sample \ncase, but not if Luxembourg becomes excluded. \n \nIII. Discussion \nHow can the non-convergence in pressure on the environment be explained? To \nstart with, the explanation does not lie in the sometimes dubious quality of the \nenvironmental statistics. To be sure, the quality of environmental statistics is often \nrelatively poor in comparison to other statistics. Most of them come with a \nqualification to the effect that \u2018the definitions of sources as well as the \nmeasurement methods may vary from country to country\u2019 (OECD 1999, p. 20) \nand that the data need to be treated with caution. However, there is no reason to \npresume that the imprecision apparent in the data has any systematic influence on \nthe existence or not of a converging trend.5 \n                                                                                                                                     \n4\n The reader should note that from an environmental and human health perspective, pressure per \ncapita is the more relevant indicator, of course. \n5\n One anonymous reviewer wondered whether the results are partially triggered by the distorting \neffect German reunification and partial de-industrialisation of the East German L\u00e4nder might have \n11 \nOne plausible explanation could be that the existing national regulations of \npressure on the environment have not converged much and that the converging \neffect of Community induced environmental measures has been rather small, at \nleast so far. Most studies on convergence in environmental governance find only \nmodest evidence for some limited convergence, keeping in mind of course that \nthese studies often look more at the style of environmental policy making rather \nthan the strictness of emission standards (see Fern\u00e1ndez 1994; Heritier 1995; \nLenschow 1997; Weale et al. 2000). Since European policies are dependent on \ntheir implementation through national administrations the persistent divergence \nwith respect to environmental governance will lead to divergent environmental \npolicy outcomes as well (Knill 1997; Knill and Lenschow 1997; McCormick \n2001). Interestingly, Jordan (1999) argues that implementation deficits are hard to \novercome since in part those deficits are necessary to maintain a delicate balance \nbetween supranational and national regulation authority. \nFurthermore, it might be too early still for Community induced environmental \nmeasures to have a strong converging effect, even though it has been hailed as \nstanding out \u2018as a notable European and international policy achievement when \ncompared to other EU issue areas\u2019 (Zito 2000, p. 2). As Weale et al. (2000, p. \n186) put it: \u2018\u2026the new dynamism of EU environmental policy from the mid-\n1980s only really began to have some qualitative impact on national policies from \nthe early 1990s, especially in southern Europe\u2019. For example, regulation of VOC \nwas adopted at the EU level not before 1994. It is likely to take even longer until \nthese changes in policies translate into changes in pressure on the environment. \n                                                                                                                                     \non the results reported. In sensitivity analysis I took out Germany from all computations. None of \nthe results were substantially affected. \n12 \nMaybe, therefore, if one were to repeat this article\u2019s exercise in ten years time or \nso, one might find much stronger evidence for convergence starting in the mid-\n1990s. Note, however, that even in the case of NOx and SOx emissions, which \nhave been subject to EU wide regulation for a considerable period of time, there \nare few signs for convergence and indeed some indication of divergence in the \ncase of SOx emissions. The latter might be explained by the fact that regulation is \nincomplete and that Greece, Ireland and Portugal were allowed to increase their \nemissions at the same time as other countries had to cut back their emissions \n(Weale et al. 2000, p. 387). More generally, the willingness of environmental \n\u2018leaders\u2019 to accept to some extent divergent policy outcomes in \u2018laggard\u2019 \ncountries might partly explain why in many cases environmental pressure in EU \ncountries is improving on average, but is not converging. \n \nIV. Concluding remarks \nGiven the economic and policy changes in EU countries during the period of our \nstudy one would expect pressure on the environment to have decreased and \nconverged. In looking at pressure related to air and water pollution we observe \ndecreased pressure, but there is very little evidence for and sometimes even \nevidence against convergence. This represents somewhat of a puzzle. Two aspects \nof this puzzle need to be explored in future research. First, does the puzzle hold in \nother areas of pressure on the environment as well? Due to limited data \navailability, this analysis concentrated on pressure that mainly causes air and \nwater pollution. There is no reason to presume that other areas should show \nstronger signs of convergence, but one cannot be sure. As data become available \nfor other areas as well, a similar analysis needs to be repeated. Second, what \n13 \nfactors can explain non-convergence? One possible answer is that the factors \ngoing against convergence such as bureaucratic inertia coupled with national \nidiosyncracies in environmental policy making prevent convergence. Another \npossibility is that it is too early still to detect convergence and that the factors \ncausing convergence need a longer time span to have a significant impact upon \npressure on the environment. But no more than these rather tentative answers are \ngiven here as this really represents a topic for future research. All in all, therefore, \nthis research note has posed as many new questions as it has given answers, but it \nis hoped that these questions are worth further exploration. \n \nReferences \nAndersen, M.S. and Liefferink, D.
