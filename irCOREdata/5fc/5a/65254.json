The effect \nof government stress on achieving an evidence base has been to reinforce a pre-existing \ndivide between empirical and theory based social science knowledge, in which the call \nfor evidence is associated with an objectivist standard, and against which other forms of \nresearch are found wanting. This has reinforced a division in social policy \nimplementation between conceptualisation and the empirical evidence with which it \nshould work. As a result there has been a proliferation of empiricist studies, founded in \nthe methods of the social sciences, without any consistent relationship to theory and \nrelated methodology (Walker, 2001). Theory based evaluation has represented one \napproach to address these issues but with limited success (Sanderson, 2003). \nThe problem is not simply one of failing to appreciate the insights available through a \nrange of social theories. It is that, more importantly, the failure to be conscious of the \nontological and epistemological basis of the knowledge derived has not only led to the \ntheory blindness that Walker describes, but has undermined the possibility of social \nscience to inform the policy implementation process. The real potential for using social \nscience knowledge lies in a critical awareness of the nature of the knowledge produced. \nThe objectivist\/empiricist approach to what constitutes evidence represents a divergence \nwhich could eventually dispense with social theory altogether in favour of technical \n 2 \nmethods.  This appears to be a growing trend, propelled in a move toward the \u201eaudit \nsociety\u201f (Power, 1997) as government tries to employ linear ideas about implementation \nand associated evaluation across the range of its functions. This article aims to suggest an \nalternative to empiricist local description which draws explicitly on complexity paradigm \nand allows us to build on the work of Sanderson (2000, 2002) and of Barnes et al (2003) \non the relevance of complexity to evaluation. It further identifies a potential for \nunderstanding the relationship of structure and agency in complexity consistent terms \nthrough an approach to social theory based on Strauss\u201f work on negotiated order. \nWorking from this level of theory we can develop research question and devise the means \nfor interpreting the qualitative data which is the core data for much evaluative study. \n \nFrom Weber onwards we have been aware that social science proceeds through a critical \nexamination of the, often implicit, value bases of phenomena in the social world \n(Runciman, 1978). This is particularly important in policy, where the scrutiny of \ninnovation must comprehend the power and interests of a range of actors in their relation \nto changing and contestable social structures. The questions that are important are not \nthen, only whether the policy has technically achieved a desired outcome, but how both \nthe problem and the solution have been conceived and the consequences of these \nconceptions for whose interests have been served and whose interests suffered. Such \nissues are central to the question of policy sustainability and lay bare underlying theories \nand values. Frequently because of their underlying assumptions, policy researchers \ncommit the error detected by Reed and Harvey in the Parsonian approach of \u201etipping the \n 3 \nhat\u2019 to economic and ecological factors, \u2018as it rushed off to explore the cultural \nconstitution of organisations\u2019 (1992, p366).  \nThe recent debate on the place of theory has been a response to these forces and one \nimportant development has been the recognition of complexity theory in providing us \nwith an alternative way of understanding the world within which attempts at engineering \nare designed (Byrne, 2001, Medd, 2001). This article will seek to develop the argument \nfor an explanatory role of this theory for understanding and evaluating such interventions \nbased on achieving coherence between ontological, epistemological understanding and \nsubstantive theory. It will argue that these levels are mutually implicating and, in \nconsequence, an explicit appreciation of their impact is important, not only for evaluation \ndesign, but for the derivation and interpretation of findings. It will point to the value of \ncomplexity theory as a framework but will argue that the account needs to be developed \nfurther in order to have the tools to handle agency. This can be found in negotiated order \nwhich can provide such a complexity consistent account. \nComplexity and evaluation \nThe value of complexity theory to the social sciences has been appreciated  relatively \nrecently (Byrne, 1998, Cilliers, 1998 Urry, 2003). While its propositions are becoming \nmore widely known, for the purposes of this article the principal tenets are sketched to \nprovide a basis for the argument that follows. A more developed discussion of the \nrelevance of complexity theory for evaluation can be found in Sanderson (2000, 2002). A \nprime affiliation of complexity theory is its foundation in critical realism, based in \nunderstanding the world as a hierarchically layered, complex system which is \ncharacterised by feedback and in which the simple cause- effect relationships sought in \n 4 \npositive science can often fail to appear. In a critique of the experimental method Bhaskar \n(1997) points to the problem that in the real world, the absence of controlled conditions, \ncan undermine causal accounts. He argues that generative entities are part of a system in \nwhich interaction sometimes promotes, and sometimes suppresses, causal relations. \n \nThis account of reality accords with our understanding that there is no such thing as \nunique determination, nor even any comprehensive explanation in the social sciences that \nfails to take account of the differential impacts of a range of conditions in the wider \nenvironment in relation to which a phenomenon occurs. The implication of Bhaskar\u201fs \ntheory is that the nature of systems and settings is open and irreversible; they have \nhistory.  Far from describing closed adaptive systems that seek always to return to a \nstable state, Bhaskar describes systems that are constantly evolving over time. As a result \nany attempt to develop predictive laws is inappropriate, but one can deal well with post \nhoc explanation and understand longer term tendencies, recognising that systems \nincorporate stochastic processes. Bhaskar describes a system of layered, dialectical \nentities which form part of a hierarchically structured, open system that is greater than the \nsum of its parts. Corresponding to such a world is a science of open, dynamic and \nhistorical, systems (Reed and Harvey, 1992). Causal movements are recognized as \nreciprocally interactive and therefore often create \u201enon-linear feedbacks that operate in \nstaggered rhythms to produce a world of historically constituted, evolving constellations. \nThis \u201eopen interactive world of things and contingent tendencies constitutes the proper \nobject of scientific investigation\u201f, (Harvey 2002, p165).  \n \n 5 \nIn deriving this account, agency is recognized as a capacity to transform things, and \nthrough reflexivity, itself. Its emergent character then comes to the fore. \nThe idea of human agency or praxis as transformative negation of the given (think of \ncooking a meal, mending a bike); and at the same time as both enabled and constrained \nby and reproductive or transformative of the very conditions of praxis, so that these \nconditions are activity dependent or autopoietic, conceptualized (concept-dependent but \nnot concept exhausted) and geo-historically dependent (and thus themselves possible \nobjects of transformation (Bhaskar 1994; 92-3- quoted in Harvey 2002) \nComplexity theory conceives of systems that are open and evolving over time to create \npath dependence, but subject to internal perturbations which inspire non-linearities.  This \nmeans that while prediction is not possible, explanation is. When applied to the social \nsciences it provides an epistemology for understanding the interaction between structures \nand human agents. The physical world depicted in a science of dissipative systems has \nmuch in common with the world that sociologists seek to explain. \n \nWe therefore have a clear place for structure and agency in the critical realism and \ncomplexity theory and can turn to sociological theory to consider how this can be \naccessed in empirical study. The problem of achieving an explanation of the relationship \nbetween agency and structure has exercised considerable sociological attention \nthroughout the history of the subject (Dawe, 1970). Bourdieu\u201fs habitus is a notable \nattempt to encapsulate the embodiment of structure in a way that leaves place for agency \n(1990). Giddens duality, expressed in terms of structuration theory, equally claims to \nhave overcome the divide 1979). Neither theory has been universally acclaimed as \n 6 \nsolving the problem of uniting sociologies of social order and social control (Mouzelis \n1995).  \nThis becomes a problem for practice because these relationships have to be understood in \nany attempt to bring about change in the world or to achieve a policy target. The failure  \nto understand the implications of this knowledge for policy is serious in its lack of \nconsciousness of the impact of implicit understandings for developing evidence in \nevaluative research. It renders a claim to produce knowledge based on social science \nproblematic and has been partly responsible for the retreat to a highly vulnerable, \ntechnocratic approach to methods identified earlier. Substantial consequences flow from \nthe choices made. In examining policy processes and implementation we are reflexively \nmonitoring their action in the world. This necessarily involves interpretation. In the \nrealist ontology described by Bhaskar the distinction between transitive knowledge of the \nworld and the intransitive nature of the world itself is important. He points out that all \nscience is social activity and its practice gives rise to transitive knowledge of an \nintransitive world. Working between these two levels is the sphere of operation of an \nevaluative study. It acknowledges the process of evaluation as a construction, albeit one \nfounded in a world that combines both the constructed and those relatively permanent \nelements, which have a structural quality. \n \n We can adopt a view of self-equilibrating systems which tend to return to a stable state \nas Parsons did (1937). Alternatively, in adopting complexity theory, we conceive of the \nworld as constituted by far-from -equilibrium systems which emerge from their \nconditions and their histories. These systems exhibit \u201enon-linear feedback mechanisms\u201f \n 7 \nthat give rise to ever increasing structural complexity. They are characterized by \ninteraction and this implies the impossibility of prediction. The stochastic processes \ninherent in these systems are not amenable to a positivist approach to description and \nprediction.  \nSanderson (2002) has contributed significantly to thinking about the implications of this \nfor evaluation in questioning the relationship between knowledge and action and the role \nof the evaluator in the modern policy context. The problem of prediction is clearly an \nissue of significance for such studies while the importance of context is such that \nexplanations have to take place at the local\n1\n level. He quotes Rescher: \nThe fact is that in situations of unmanageable complexity, practice in matters of public policy \nis often guided more effectively by localized experimental trial-and error than by the \ntheorizing resources of an intellectual technology unable to cope with the intricacy of \ninteraction feedbacks and in predictable effects. \np.189, quoted in Sanderson 2002 \n  \nAt first glance the implication of this conclusion is that empiricist understanding is \nadequate. Yet the complexity based formulation of the problem explicitly acknowledges \nthat no simple empiricism is possible. The paradigmatic nature of knowledge requires \nthat we situate empirical findings (Kuhn, 1970). Attempts to find out about the world as \nwell as attempts to change it necessitate such reflexive awareness. We need further to \nengage with theory that explains the social world as not only structured and external, but \nas also a construction of the actors within it. Such theory can be used to achieve a critical \nunderstanding of the relationships that emerge.  \nIn referring to Giddens, Sanderson argues that the loosening of tradition suggests \nincreasing reflexivity. There appears to be evidence to support this claim in the \n                                                 \n1\n Local refers to system rather than geographical locality although in the context of this article the two map \non to each other consistently. \n 8 \nrelationships observed between professionals and consumers in the public services \n(Callaghan and Wistow 2006). This should not be taken to imply, however, as several \nwriters have suggested, that reflexivity itself means that agents are freed from structures, \n(Giddens 1984, Lash and Urry1994). The relationship between agency and structure may \nbe reformed but this is not sufficient to claim that one is freed from the other. In making \nclaims for a new understanding based on complexity we need to work with this \nrelationship to develop ways of understanding agentic behaviour in shaping the complex \nsystems within which they interact.  \n \nInstead of deriving order-seeking systems emerging from new policy innovations, \ncomplexity theory suggests we must understand dissipative systems that contain \ninnovative possibilities, which in certain configurations of circumstance can yield radical \nchange. There is then no expectation of a \u201ereturn\u201f to equilibrium but rather, new relatively \nstable states established in response to changing conditions which forms the basis of \nfuture boundary testing and perturbation (i.e. history). Barnes et al (2003) recognised the \nimportance of this from their experience of the HAZ evaluation and made some \nobservations on an approach to research. In this article these issues are considered further \nand an approach to researching them is developed. \nThe limitations of complexity \nComplexity theory gives us frame for understanding but does not provide all of the tools \nrequired to explicate local action. If complexity-based evaluation is to inform the policy \nprocess this is a vital stage in developing an account because theory not only informs \nevaluation design, but shapes the explanation derived.  \n 9 \nWe need an account that can work with the complexity frame to develop understanding \nfor the relation of action and structure at the local level. In order to develop a coherent \nlocal explanation of the social world has to be understood in terms of overlapping \ndualisms of structure and action, macro and micro levels. The dynamics of the operation \nof the system must be understood through an account of process that can recognise the \nexistence of regularities, while at the same time acknowledging the contingent nature of \ntheir operation. Much of what we see in complexity based studies is explanation at the \naggregate level identifying trends and system level indicators rather than the direct \nengagement with agency of individuals and collectives. Frequently when evaluating \npolicy interventions that involve innovative service configurations and local pilot studies \nwe are attempting to integrate such quantitative data with a large body of qualitative data. \nComplexity is a frame for explanation and we need an associated frame to allow us the \nmeans to analyse and explain the latter. Barnes et al (2003) have suggested a social \nconstructionist account. Within this broad epistemology I will argue that we can draw \nupon negotiated order to posit the relationships and processes involved. We need to \nunderstand both the dynamics of system change over time, at the macro and micro level, \nbut also to explain how that occurs through the meaningful action of individuals in the \nlocal setting. This is the level at which we can explain reproduction or change within \nsystems. \nOperationalising agency \n \nA central absence in the practice of social science has been in applying the implications \nof these understandings to direct policy research. The separation between those working \nwith theory in the social sciences and institutionalised empiricist social research has its \n 10 \nmost damaging impact here. Questioning a technical-rational approach based on \nobjectivism is fundamental and implies rethinking the nature and meaning of the process \nand research undertaken to examine it. One particular, and hugely consequential, \nimplication of complexity theory for evaluation studies is that the transferable knowledge \nto be gained is not direct and cannot be based on extracting factors from context. What is \nof much greater value is the context-rich explanation that can be derived. The simple idea \nof \u201eroll out\u201f from pilot studies becomes problematic.  \nThe promise of theory based approach however is much greater. In moving away from \nobjectivist, determinist explanations we can actually begin to make space for human \nagency. This understanding begins from a recognition that human individuals are not the \n\u201ecultural dopes\u201f problematised by Garfinkel (1967) in his reaction to Parsonian systems \ntheory, rather they act upon a material world to transform it. We can return to Weber for \ninsights into the importance of reflexivity as a central feature of such human action \n(Shils, 1949). Nicolis and Prigogine (1989) put this in far-from equilibrium terms \nrecognising the impact of individual projects and desires, often based on anticipated \nfutures, which in combination with environment, shapes the dynamics of the system. \nIt is the reflexivity of agents and their ability to anticipate and act accordingly that \nprevents the narrative of history from being a deterministic story. \n \nThe role of agency is less often theorised in studies that purport to understand the \nmanifestation of cause and process in policy implementation because of implicit linear \nlogic. Frequently the roles of \u201echampions\u201f and \u201ereticulists\u201f (Friend et al 1974) are treated \nin unproblematically voluntaristic terms. To develop that lens we can draw on the \n 11 \nconcept of negotiated order to suggest the value of insights from social theory to \nunderstanding policy processes. This theory allows a fit between a complexity-consistent \nunderstanding of structure and action at the local level and from this foundation it \nbecomes possible to identify ways of exploring and understanding the system and which \ncan access meaning, individual and collective action.  \nThe notion of negotiated order is premised in understanding how systems are not only \nstructural entities, but are also fundamentally shaped in the context of the forces and \nconditions pertaining at the \u201ebottom\u201f of the hierarchy, being created and re-created by the \nactors located there. Strauss (19363) developed the concept from his fieldwork in \norganisations in response to the clash between the perspectives of Parsons (primacy of \norder) and Dewey (primacy of change).  He argued that within organisations order is \nnegotiated and that this is an ongoing production of the actors involved. Organisational \nrelations, therefore, although having a structural quality are the product of this continual \nprocess of making and remaking. The existence of structure is important in setting the \npositions from which individuals negotiate and, in turn, give these negotiations their \npatterned quality, but these products are historical and temporally shaped; always open to \nreview and revision. The order that is produced is best described as negotiated because it \nrelies on the daily decisions of actors within this context.  \nIn a later article Strauss corrected an early overemphasis on the role of actors: \nWhat was omitted [from our first formulation of the negotiated order was] \nactors\u2019 theories of negotiation  [and] detailing of negotiation subprocesses. \nHence \u2026no explicit specifying of conditions and consequences associated \nwith these subprocesses\u2026 no working out of a paradigmatic analysis in terms \n 12 \nof structural contexts and negotiation contexts \u2026virtually no references to the \noptions for alternatives to negotiation: coercion, persuasion, manipulation of \ncontingencies, and so on. Issues relating to rules, norms, and the like were \nhandled explicitly, but others, relating to power, coalition, politics, and the \nlike, were touched on only implicitly. \n(Strauss, 1993. p249-250) \nIn negotiated order we can understand the structures as created but also as creating the \ncontext for action. This has echoes through Marx, \u201eMan makes his own history, but he \ndoes not make it out of the whole cloth; he does not make it out of conditions chosen by \nhimself, but out of such as he finds close at hand. The tradition of all past generations \nweighs like an alp on the brain of the living.\u201f (2004), and Bourdieu, whose concept of \nhabitus is the pre-conscious embodiment of this interactive relationship (1990). For \nStrauss the negotiation of order within organisations is essential to its operation. If we \nsubstitute the notion of system for organisation, these negotiations have particular \ncharacteristics that render them useful to complexity based evaluation. They involve a \ncrucial temporal dimension, being constituted and reorganized over time in relation to the \nregularities established by the structures, the essentially patterned nature of relationships \nand forms of interaction. \nInterestingly Fine (1984), in his discussion of negotiated order, described it as a metaphor \nrather than a theory because it provides a \u201eway of looking at the world\u201f rather than \ntestable propositions ( p240).  The same comment has commonly been made in \nintroducing complexity theory to the social sciences. This paper is seeking to consider \nhow these \u201eways of looking\u201f can be used to inform evaluation practice. \n 13 \n \nThe four tenets of negotiated order are usefully summarised by Fine: \nFirst Strauss argued provocatively that all social order is negotiated order: \norganization is not possible without some form of negotiation. Second, he \nasserted that specific negotiations are contingent on the structural conditions \nof organization (a point occasionally deemphasized by his followers). \nNegotiations follow lines of communication, i.e. they are patterned, not \nrandom. Third negotiations have temporal limits, and they are renewed, \nrevised and reconstituted over time. Fourth structural changes in organization \nrequire a revision of the negotiated order. In other words, the structure of the \norganization and the micropolitics of the negotiated order are closely \nconnected.  \n(Fine 1984, p241) \nEach of these tenets can be found in complexity terms, recognising the importance \nof interaction, history and contingency. Positing the negotiated nature of order \nrecognises the significance of local action in shaping the system and the relevance \nof interaction in bringing about change, whose nature may have been anticipated by \nnone of the participants. Such negotiations are regularly observable in the \ncompromises and reformulations of policy at the local level. They are based on pre-\nexisting structures which have formed historically through a sedimentation process. \nThis has been recognised as significantly shaping the actual nature of policy \nimplementation based on the interaction of new initiatives with pre-existing \nconfigurations and organisational relations. Studies of such initiatives have \n 14 \nrecognised the significance of history (Hudson et al 1999). Closely associated with \nstructures are patterned ways of communicating within and between organisations \nwhich can be explored through the formal and the informal processes that each \nhave their impact on its nature. In identifying the relationship between structure and \nmicro-politics Strauss begins to identify what it is relevant to know. Together they \nprovide a basis for evidence of why, for example, target-driven approaches are seen \nby complexity theory as undermining (Medd, 2001), and more broadly as \ndistorting, the systems that they try to control (Bevan and Hood, 2006). These \nexternal interventions disrupt or reshape the negotiations that take place, bringing \nwith them both intended and unintended consequences. \n \nIn evaluating policy Sanderson (2002) has pointed to the problem of attributing cause in \ncomplex, cross-cutting and multiple interventions. Such policy initiatives operate within \nthe context a relationship of structure and agency in which negotiation plays a significant \nrole. Negotiated order is complexity consistent, drawing attention to the multiplicity of \nperspectives which,\u201f derives from differential statuses, experiences, and memberships in \ngroups, organizations and local worlds (Strauss, 1993 p252). These negotiated elements \ncan often be identified in the process of implementing rules and policies, originating from \nthe centre, but taking specific local form. Using negotiated order, we can identify the \nimpact of different organisational cultures and levels of professional power as well as the \nroles and legitimacies of other actors in the system In examining the impact of policy at \nthe local level we are trying to grasp interactions between a range of, not always \ncongruent, interests based in historical actions, which set the conditions and boundaries \n 15 \naround what is considered possible. An appeal to negotiated order theory allows us to \nidentify a strong role for social science knowledge and, within this context, the relevance \nand possibility of building knowledge in successive evaluations across contexts. Rather \nthan \u201ejudging\u201f outcomes as dysfunctional we can understand the particular order that has \nbeen, and is being, negotiated and to bring theories of power to bear upon that \nunderstanding. We can then revisit the kind of learning that can take place. Here several \nquestions emerge once we reject the Newtonian version of science based on \nreductionism, determinism and objective knowledge. \nIf an existing order is a negotiated order in Strauss\u201f terms then an evaluation of a new \npolicy initiative seeks to examine these negotiations, informed by the interests of actors, \nbased on the philosophies and ideologies of their professional practice and the \norganisational constraints within which they work. In evaluating cross-cutting and \nmultiple interventions significant knowledge arises through understanding these \nnegotiations. Constructionism is helpful in reminding us that these issues and the \nobjectives of policy may be defined differently according to the standpoint of the actors \ninvolved. We need to go beyond that to understand the interaction of these elements to \nexplain action at the local level, based in local histories and the contingency of causation. \nThus for example, instead of bemoaning individual failures or suggesting professional \nintransigence in the face of new policy, we would develop an understanding of the \npersistence of the demarcation disputes and boundary setting activity that frustrates \nattempts to secure \u201ejoined up\u201f working (Alaszewski, et al 2003). Professional and \norganisational boundaries within the sphere of health and social care can be understood \nas negotiations in the context of structural conditions which may be embedded in, but \n 16 \nextend beyond, the organisational or professional remit to the wider systemic level \n(Callaghan and Wistow, 2006). \n \nWhile it might be claimed that this knowledge could be deployed within a positive \nframework the point here is that this approach is epistemologically consistent with an \nunderstanding based in complexity theory. The latter sensitises us to what is the \nimportant information to seek. We are, then, looking for information about a world that is \nnot at equilibrium but one in which small local variations can be decisive in both the \nmagnitude and form of change in an intervention. Complexity theory helps us to \nunderstand what to look for. Negotiated order theory suggests ways of investigating these \nissues and identifying the processes and negotiations that shape policy. Rather than \ndiscounting local variation, it acknowledges that systems are characterised by local action \nand that such action forms a sedimentation of practices that gives the system history. The \ncrucial thing then is to understand it. The value of this theory lies in taking us one stage \nfurther in applying complexity theory to creating researchable questions. \n \nConclusion \n \nThe methods based contribution that social science currently makes to policy purports to \nemploy the rigorous methods of social science to build knowledge but has generally done \nthis innocent of theory (Walker, 2001).  Although it is claimed that the place of blue skies \nresearch remains the pressure for social science knowledge to have direct application has \nincreased considerably. Walker has pointed to the many institutional and practical \nreasons for this. The argument here has been that the divide has implications beyond the \n 17 \npractical level in relying on methods without methodological foundation, ignoring the \nimportance of their relationship to epistemology and, consequently, to what we can claim \nto know. The conventional evaluation, in making objectivist claims, purports to \nindependence based on rigorous method but such evaluations frequently fail to be critical \nof the conceptualisations inherent in the policy process itself. This becomes an \nincreasingly significant issue because of the institutional encouragement toward \nempiricism relying on an implicit acceptance of the dominant paradigm of traditional \nscience. The very promise of social science begins with its ability to question the \nobjectivist basis of such authority and indeed, to reflexively recognise the impact of such \nconstructions on the processes themselves.  \n \nThis article has attempted to suggest a way of reuniting practice with its theoretical base \nin order to inform policy research. Much valuable learning is missed in operating with a \nnormal science conception of the world and a reductionist\/objectivist conception of \nknowledge. The aim here is to develop the discussion, begun by Sanderson, to think \nabout how we can conduct research based on the insights that complexity theory can \nbring in order to develop knowledge of value for policy-makers. \n \nThe prime value of the approach suggested here lies in the questions to which it can \nsensitise us. It has been argued that negotiated order provides us with a way of looking \nwhich can access the nested nature of reality proposed in complexity theory. In order to \nunderstand this we need to observe and to question, through a range of qualitative \nmethods, how people work with those relatively permanent structures in the daily process \n 18 \nof making and remaking the world. Comparative case studies have long been employed \nin social science as a way of learning about how and why outcomes vary. Through \ncomplexity we can derive data that identifies outcome and long run changes and, through \nnegotiated order, we can bring a way of understanding how the system gives rise to such \nchange. \n \nThis understanding of context and history is crucial to evaluation at any scale. An \nexample from a familiar (and what might appear to be a relatively micro level, \nobservation) may serve to illustrate the point. The vexed question of who should provide \na bath to an older person became notorious in the 1990s. The bath provided by NHS was \nfree, while the bath provided by social care was charged for according to the means of the \nuser. Both health and social services were under pressure to guard their own budgets and \nto avoid taking responsibility beyond their direct obligations to patients and users. On this \nbasis each service was encouraged to define the need in terms of services provided by the \nother. The decision about which was provided was based on the resolution of a question \nabout whether an individual needs a bath for their health or whether this is a social need. \nProfessionals everywhere pointed to the impossibility of making such a distinction but \nwere often, in practice, set in hostile relationships with professionals in the other service, \nin an attempt to defend their own boundary. \n \nEvaluative studies that consider only organisational and professional elements tend to \nseek solutions to this problem in the co-location of professionals and \u201eblurring\u201f \nprofessional and organisational boundaries. Policy responses such as \u201eIntermediate Care \n 19 \nfor Older People\u201f have directly employed this rationale. While such solutions clearly \nhelp, the causal explanation derived is limited, sometimes involving a judgemental \nattribution of blame to the agents involved.  \n \nThe approach to this question using complexity theory suggests different questions. In the \ncase of the boundaries between health and social care, we are encouraged by complexity \ntheory to identify the effects of a systemic level, in which the co-existences of a \u201efree at \nthe point of delivery\u201f health care system, and a means-tested social care system, creates \ntensions which permeate everyday practice. The way in which the bath was resolved was \nthrough negotiations that went on on a daily basis between care managers and district \nnurses. Observation of how these issues are worked on in practice suggests that we \nexplore the combination of professional role and organisational pressures, the history of \npractice within the locality, impacts of new policy from the centre, as well as those more \nenduring structural issues identified above. These negotiations were infused with the \npressure to maintain organisational boundaries, but were translated into a quasi-\nprofessional decision about whether the bath was necessary for health or for social \nreasons. Solutions varied widely between localities and according to no simple rationale, \nbut were achieved by agents (whose action was also patterned in terms of local history \nand professional ethics). It is by observing and unpicking how these issues shape the \ndaily practice of professionals that we can understand and comment on the whole.  \n \nConsciousness of the contribution of the institutionalisation of local practice, brought \nabout through the interaction of current agency with history, enables us to understand \n 20 \nhow systems are reproduced and how they change. Using negotiated order theory we are \nalerted to the questions: How has the particular order been negotiated in this place by the \nactors involved? What structural conditions, patterns of communication, in what temporal \nscale, achieved the current order? What do changes, for example, in policy initiatives, \ncreate in renewing or reforming this order? Such questions point to the flaws inherent in \nthe positivist conception of policy pilots, yet at the same time rescue the possibility of \nlearning from them by reconceiving their role and nature in complexity terms. \n \nFurthermore this approach suggests that the role of evaluation, rather than a judgement, \ncan more properly be conceived as an exploration of the manifestation of complex \ncausality. The aim becomes to provide a better understanding of how the current order \nhas been achieved. Rather than seeking to draw direct and transferable \u201erules\u201f for practice \nfrom an evaluative study, it recognises that the nature of complex reality is that it has \nhistory and is local. It is more important then to understand the interaction of elements in \na complex system to which policy-makers can respond by creating space for achieving \nsystem objectives (Bevan and Hood, 2006). \n  \nIn social policy innovations fundamental questions of the relationship between structure \nand agency are ever-present matters of practice but they have frequently been ignored in \nservice of a rational\/technical approach to evidence. We are left with some accounts that \nrely on implicit structural\/deterministic understandings, others that deploy structurally \nblind individualism, while more are based on some inconsistent combination of the two. \nIn many respects this is an old complaint yet it seems important to resist the creeping \n 21 \neffects of empiricism in social science practice because it encourages an uncritical \napproach to policy evaluation. In this article the case has been made for reuniting the two \nusing complexity, based on a realist ontology, to provide an associated epistemology \nthrough which to explore these issues. The relevance of such theory is not in claiming \npredictive potential, but in offering a way of looking, and thereby, the means to develop a \ndialogue at the local level, acknowledging the structures and forces of relative \npermanence as well as those of contingency. It has been proposed here that the theory of \nnegotiated order provides a way of exploring these phenomena and the processes \nimmanent within them as they manifest themselves in local policy implementation. From \nthis knowledge base there may be a role for generalisation, much in the way that has long \nbeen appreciated by qualitative researchers, based on an in-depth understanding of \ninteractions and their effects within a given context. \nReferences \n \nAlaszewski, A.
