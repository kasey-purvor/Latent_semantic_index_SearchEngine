Current \nunderstanding of the mechanism of absorption of organohalogen chemicals and the \npotential for accumulation of decabromodiphenyl ether will need reassessing in the light \nof these results. \n \nIntroduction \nOf the three main technical mixtures in use, the pentabromodiphenyl ether (PeBDE) and \noctabromodiphenyl ether (OcBDE) mixtures are currently being phased out in Europe \nbut are still in high use in other parts of the world. However, in the UK in particular, \nstringent fire retardancy regulations for furniture led to previously high use of PeBDE. \nThe decabromodiphenyl ether (DeBDE) mixture, a high usage flame retardant (approx. \n54,800 tonnes annual usage estimated in 1999 (Alaee et al., 2003)), is currently \nundergoing a comprehensive risk assessment in the European Union (EU, 2002). This \nchemical is seen as a very useful flame retardant for use in electrical equipment \nhousing, rubber insulating materials and other applications. However, there is some \nuncertainty over the possibility of DeBDE entering the environment, and if it does so, \nwhether it is available to biota. The DeBDE mixture almost entirely comprises BDE \n209, which has a high octanol-water partition coefficient (KOW), a relatively high \nmolecular weight (959 amu) and is relatively labile to heat and light (S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m et al., \n2003). PBDEs from the PeBDE mixture have been reported in a wide range of \nenvironmental media (de Wit, 2002), and concentrations in human breast milk have \nrecently been reported to be substantially higher in North America than in Europe \n3 \n 3\n(Petreas et al, 2003). DeBDE, despite it\u2019s higher usage, has only been found in a small \nnumber of environmental studies, generally linked to sediments near sites of production \nand use (Sellstr\u00f6m et al., 1998, Allchin et al., 1999), and, recently, in the eggs of wild \nbirds of prey in Scandinavia (Lindberg et al., 2004), although laboratory studies have \ngenerally shown low or negligible absorption by animals (El Dareer  et al., 1987; M\u00f6rck \nand Klasson Wehler, 2001). However, Sandholm et al. have reported that about 26% \nBDE-209 was bioavailable in rats and suggested that the relatively high concentrations \nof phenolic metabolites present in the blood plasma compared to the parent BDE-209 \nindicated that total adsorption was higher than 26%. (Sandholm et al., 2003). Jakobsson \net al. (2003) have reported up to 36 pmol BDE-209 \/g lipid in the blood of \noccupationally exposed workers. \nPolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and many organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) have \nbeen banned or restricted in many countries since the 1970s due to their \nbioaccumulative and persistent properties, and have been dropping in concentration in \nmany environmental media for the last two decades or so (e.g. Bignert et al., 1998). \nHowever, there are concerns about the concentrations of these chemicals in the marine \nenvironment (Tanabe, 1988; Aguilar et al., 2002), and recent work has highlighted the \npossibility that these chemicals may increase carcinogenic effects on biota at doses \nmuch lower than previously thought (Kalantzi et al., 2004). \nVery high concentrations of PBDEs, PCBs and OCPs have been recorded in a range of \nmarine mammals (Aguilar et al., 2002; Law et al., 2002). Organohalogen contamination \nhas been implicated in endocrine disruption effects, leading to increased susceptibility \nto a range of diseases, some of which have been seen as epizootic episodes in recent \nyears (Oberd\u00f6rster and Cheek, 2000). Recently, PBDEs have been shown to affect \n4 \n 4\nthyroid hormone activity in mammals (Fowles et al., 1994; Meerts et al., 1998), and we \nhave recently reported a correlation between PBDE and thyroid hormone levels in North \nSea grey seals (Hall et al., 2003). \nMaterials and Methods \nStudy design and sampling - An input-output balance study was performed on three \ncaptive (wild) juvenile grey seals (Halichoerus grypus). The seals were fed a constant \ndiet of North Sea herring for 3 months before this study started, by which time we \nanticipated that steady-state conditions, with respect to the chemicals of interest found \nin the diet, would have been approached. This study then lasted 3 months, during which \nfish were all taken from one frozen batch caught in the North Sea, defrosted as \nnecessary. Each seal consumed between 1 and 2.5 kg (fresh weight) fish per day. In the \nsecond month of the study the seals were fed a supplement of 12 \u00b5g decabromodiphenyl \nether per day, dissolved in cod liver oil in a capsule, and in the final month the seals \nwere fed a control (unspiked) cod liver oil capsule each day. On a weekly basis fish \nsamples (3 fish) were taken from the defrosted fish batch, a blood sample was taken and \na 24 hour faeces sample was collected whilst each seal was kept in an individual dry \nenclosure. A blubber biopsy was taken from each seal at three times during the study. \nChemical analysis - Samples were analysed for a range of PCBs, OCPs and PBDEs \nusing methods based on those previously published (Thomas et al., 1998; Hovander et \nal., 2000; Bayen et al., 2003), which briefly entailed the following. Whole fish were \nground separately in a steel blender and frozen until analysis. Fish, faeces or blubber \nsamples were mixed well with anhydrous sodium sulphate before dichloromethane \n(DCM) extraction using an accelerated solvent extraction system. Blood samples were \nmodified with hydrochloric acid and extracted with a mixture of hexane and MTBE, \n5 \n 5\nthen partitioned with aqueous KOH to remove phenolic chemicals. All samples were \nspiked with seven 13C-labelled PCBs and 13C-labelled BDE 209 before extraction. Fish, \nfaeces and blubber samples were cleaned-up on a column containing silica gel modified \nwith concentrated sulphuric acid, eluted with hexane. Blood samples were cleaned-up \nusing concentrated sulphuric acid. All samples received a secondary clean-up using gel \npermeation chromatography before being concentrated to a small volume with internal \nstandards added. PBDEs (except BDE 209) were analysed on a Fisons MD800 GC-MS \nin SIM mode, with separation on a 30 m long, 0.18 mm id, DB5 MS column.  The mass \nspectrometer was used in ECNI (electron capture negative ion) mode with ammonia as \nthe reagent gas. PCBs and OCPs were analysed on a Thermo Trace GC-MS in SIM \nmode using an EI+ source. Separation was achieved on a 50 m 0.25 mm id CP-Sil 8 \ncolumn. BDE 209 was analysed on a HP6890 GC attached to a VG Autospec Ultima \nused in EI+ mode, with a resolution of at least 10,000. Separation was achieved on a 15 \nm long, 0.18 mm id, DB5 MS column. \nThe method detection limit was defined as the higher of three times the standard \ndeviation of the blank values or the instrument detection limit. Recoveries averaged 67 \n\u201381 % for each of the 13C labelled standards. \nResults and Discussion \nCalculation of apparent absorption A range of PCBs, OCPs and PBDEs were found in \nthe herring and faeces; daily input and output fluxes were calculated for each seal, for \neach chemical which was found. The geometric mean concentration in fish (9 samples \nanalysed) was used to calculate the input fluxes because the concentrations determined \nappeared to follow a log-normal distribution. Faeces concentrations were used to \n6 \n 6\ncalculate output fluxes directly for the relevant day. Chemical concentrations found in \nfish are shown in Table 1, and the input and output fluxes are shown in Table 2. \nThe apparent amount of each chemical absorbed from the diet was defined as the \ndifference between the input and output fluxes, and is expressed as a percentage of the \ntotal input flux, for a selection of the chemicals, in Table 3. Because of the log-normal \ndistribution of chemical concentrations normally found in biota (for which there was \nsome evidence in this study) the data were log-transformed before calculation of the \napparent absorption using the formula presented by Juan et al. (Juan et al., 2002). \nApparent absorption may be an over- or under-estimate of true absorption, because of \nthe possibility of degradation within the gastro-intestinal tract or excretion of chemicals \nfrom previous exposure. BDE 209 was not found in the fish analysed, and apparent \nabsorption was calculated solely for the occasions when this chemical was added to the \ndiet. \nObservation on apparent absorption Consistently high absorption (>89%) of all \nchemicals analysed was observed. This extended over a log KOW range from \napproximately 3.8 (alpha-HCH) to 10.3 (BDE 209). This contrasts with work on fish \n(Gobas et al., 1993) and dairy cows (McLachlan, 1994; Thomas et al., 1999), showing a \nreduction in absorption efficiency with increasing KOW once log KOW exceeds \napproximately 6. There are several possible explanations for the consistently high \nabsorption seen in these seals: \n1) The high total body fat content of seals, compared to most land animals, will \nprovide a large capacity for storage of these hydrophobic chemicals, keeping the \nchemicals in the blood (the supplying medium) at a constant relatively low \nconcentration, and creating a relatively large fugacity gradient between the gastro-\n7 \n 7\nintestinal (GI) tract contents and the blood (the receiving medium). Assuming that \nabsorption is a purely passive process, this will cause the equilibrium between the GI \ntract content and blood to be consistently in favour of movement to the blood, i.e. that \nconsistently high absorption is maintained. \n2) Seals, being carnivores, generally have a high assimilation efficiency (AE) from \ntheir diet. A high AE implies that the organic matter content (and hence the fugacity \ncapacity) of the GI tract contents is greatly reduced compared to the food, and passive \ntransport across the GI tract wall would be in favour of movement to the blood. \nHerbivores and omnivores, which most previous mass balance and absorption studies \nhave used, have a lower AE, because their diet is less digestible. They are likely to have \na higher GI tract content fugacity capacity, and a lower POPs absorption efficiency. In \nthis study the AE (dry matter) was found to be 96.9 \u00b1 2.3 %. \n3) Incomplete collection of faeces, or reduced faeces output (due to increased stress \nin the faeces collection period) may have caused the total output flux to be \nunderestimated. However, in any 24 hour faeces collection period it is estimated that not \nmore than 10% of the faeces produced was lost due to dispersion by rainwater or by the \nseals behaviour. Comparison of the AE found in this study to AE values for herring \neaten by ringed and harp seals (Lawson et al., 1997a; 1997b) suggests that the seals \nproduced at least 50% of the faeces which might have been expected in each collection \nperiod. \n4) It has been suggested that POPs can be degraded in the GI tract, which would \nresult in an overestimation of net absorption. It is possible that this happened in this \nstudy, but we found no evidence in the concentrations of lower brominated BDE \ncongeners in faeces, which remained constant, to suggest that it may have occurred. \n8 \n 8\nTransfer of BDE 209 to blood and body-fat \u2013 Blood BDE 209 concentrations are shown \nin Figure 1. BDE 209 was not detected in blood before the seals were fed the spiked \ncapsules, nor was it found in blood after three days of BDE 209 consumption. \nMeasurable concentrations of BDE 209 had been reached in all three seals by day 45, \nand the concentrations remained measurable for the remainder of the study. Maximum \nconcentrations of BDE 209 were found in the blood between 5 and 11 days after \ncessation of spiked capsule consumption, and these maxima were followed by a rapid \ndrop in BDE 209 concentrations in each seal. On day 83 BDE 209 concentrations had \ndropped to between 14 and 15% of the maximum concentration for each seal. Fitting \nfirst order reaction curves to the BDE 209 concentration data for each seal, from day 59 \nto the end of the study, gave BDE 209 half-lives in blood between 8.5 and 13 days. \nBDE 209 was found in the blubber of two of the seals within 3 days of them starting to \ningest DeBDE-spike capsules, and was found in all three seals at the end of the study, \n29 days after the seals had ingested the last DeBDE-spiked capsule. No BDE 209 was \nfound in blubber at the beginning of the study. The total body-fat content was estimated \nroughly mid-way through the study by an isotope dilution method, using deuterated \nwater, that has been described elsewhere (Reilly and Fedak, 1990). The total body-\nburdens for each seal, estimated by multiplying the blubber concentration by the \nestimated total body-fat content, are shown in Table 4. It can be seen that at the end of \nthe study between 11 and 15% of the cumulative amount of BDE 209 ingested by each \nseal (~320 \u00b5g per seal) was stored in the blubber after 29 days on a DeBDE-free diet, \nbut that after 3 days ingesting DeBDE a larger proportion of the cumulative amount of \nBDE 209 ingested was found in the blubber of two of the seals. BDE 209 was not \ndetected in the blubber of seal 2 on day 30, although it was detected in the other two \n9 \n 9\nanimals. Seal 2 had 10.7 kg of body-fat, compared to 6.3-6.4 kg for the other seals. The \nprobable explanation for the difference between the seals is that the BDE 209 absorbed \nin the first few days will have been diluted into this bigger fat store, giving lower \nconcentrations which were below the method detection limit. \nImplications for risk assessments There are some important implications for the \nenvironmental and human risk assessment of BDE 209 and other non-ionised chemicals \nfrom this study. \n1) It has been assumed that non-ionised non-nutrient molecules with a molecular mass \nof more than 700 amu cannot cross biological membranes (M\u00f6rck and Klasson \nWehler, 2001). However, we cannot find convincing reports of this being true in the \nliterature, and suggest that this assumption requires reassessment in the light of the \nhigh absorption of BDE 209 seen in this study. \n2) This study shows that BDE 209 can be stored in the blubber of grey seals if they are \nexposed to it, although it generally appears not to be present in marine animals in the \nnatural environment. BDE 209 has, however, been found to be present in the eggs of \nbirds of prey (Lindberg et al., 2004) and has been found at low concentrations in \nsalmon (Burreau, 2001). BDE 209 has also been found in sediments from some \nlocations (Allchin et al., 999). Exposure to and absorption of BDE 209 is likely to be \ndependent on the species, food web and a combination of the ingested matrix with \nwhich the chemical is associated and the specific characteristics of the animal \ninvolved. For example, BDE 209 attached to organic rich sediment ingested by \nbottom dwelling fish is likely to be absorbed less than BDE 209 present in the bodies \nof the prey species of the fish. We believe that the cod liver oil used in this study \n10 \n 10\nshould be a comparable carrier to whole fish, since if BDE 209 were present in fish it \nwould most likely be contained within the fish lipids. \n3) BDE 209 has been shown to be readily metabolised or excreted in other animals (e.g. \nM\u00f6rck and Klasson Wehler, 2001; Sandholm et al., 2003; Sj\u00f6din et al., 1999; \nKierkegaard et al., 1999; Stapleton et al., 2003; Hagmar et al., 2000). Blood \nconcentrations of BDE 209 in the seals dropped rapidly after the maximum \nconcentration was reached, which may be due to continued transfer to the blubber or \nmetabolism, or a combination of both. BDE 209 would probably not be metabolised \nappreciably whilst stored in the blubber. Thus, animals may continue to carry a body-\nburden of BDE 209 after exposure, even though concentrations in the blood may \nrapidly become undetectable. In the wild, compounds stored in the blubber are likely \nto be re-mobilised during periods of fasting. \nReferences \nAlaee, M., Arias, P., Sjodin, A., Bergman, \u00c5., 2003.
