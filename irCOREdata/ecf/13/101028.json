Indeed, band gap\nreduction has proved difficult to observe unambiguously in\nabsorption spectra from InNAs alloys.7\u20139 The reduction of\nthe absorption-edge energy with increasing nitrogen content\nhas so far only been observed in one optical absorption study\nof InNAs alloys.6\nGenerally, absorption edges at higher energies than the\ntrue band gap are observed in n-type InNAs epilayers.7\u20139\nThis is due to the Moss-Burstein effect,10,11 resulting from\nband filling due to unintentionally degenerate n-type doping\nin the InNAs alloy. This proclivity of InAs and InNAs for\nn-type conductivity is consistent with the amphoteric defect\nmodel.12 The formation of donor-like impurities and defects\nis favoured because the \u0002-point CBM in InAs is below the\nbranch-point energy, EB.13 The incorporation of dilute\namounts of nitrogen lowers the CBM further, making the\ntendency towards degenerate n-type conductivity even stron-\nger in InNAs than in InAs.

Redistribution subject toby Hall measurements of InNAs films grown on semi-\ninsulating GaAs substrates by molecular-beam epitaxy\n\u0001MBE\u0002.8 Therefore, the nitrogen-induced band gap reduction\nin InNAs can generally only be estimated from absorption\nspectroscopy once the contribution of Moss-Burstein shift to\nthe position of the absorption edge has been modeled.7\u20139\nIn this letter, the temperature dependence of photolumi-\nnescence \u0001PL\u0002 from dilute InNAs films grown by MBE is\nreported. The PL spectra unambiguously show band gap re-\nduction with increasing N content. For degenerate doping,\noptical absorption transitions can only occur for photon en-\nergies higher than the energy needed for electrons to make\ntransitions from the valence band up to the Fermi level in the\nconduction band.14 By contrast, the PL peak is due to the\nphotons spontaneously emitted when electrons from the con-\nduction band recombine with holes in the valence band. As a\nresult, PL measurements of the band gap are not significantly\naffected by moderately high Fermi levels in the conduction\nband. However, PL still has to be interpreted with caution,\nsince at low temperatures it can originate from the tail of\nlocalized states at the band edge associated with any disorder\nin the alloy.15\nThe InNAs epilayers were coherently grown to a thick-\nness of 300 nm on InAs\u0001001\u0002 substrates by MBE using a\nturbopumped Vacuum Generators V80 system equipped with\nan Oxford Applied Research \u0001OAR\u0002 HD25 rf plasma nitro-\ngen source. The samples were all grown with a substrate\ntemperature of 375 \u00b0C. The nitrogen incorporation in the\nInNAs samples was varied by changing the plasma power\nand nitrogen gas pressure. The nitrogen content was deter-\nmined by x-ray diffraction \u0001XRD\u0002 using Cu K\u0003 \u0001\u0004\n=1.5406 \u00c5\u0002 as the radiation source.

The spectra were analyzed with a\nBomem midinfrared fast-scanning Fourier-transform infrared\n\u0001FTIR\u0002 spectrometer, a liquid-nitrogen-cooled InSb detector\nand a digital lock-in amplifier. Since the maximum fringe\nmodulation frequency of the FTIR spectrometer is \u00053.3 kHz\ndue to mirror scanning, it was necessary to chop the laser at\nthe relatively high frequency of 20 kHz.\nPhotoluminescence spectra from InAs, InN0.010As0.990,\nand InN0.022As0.978 recorded at temperatures of between 78\nand 293 K are shown in Fig. 2. The InAs PL peak broadens\nand shifts to lower energy as the temperature is increased.\nThe PL peak from InN0.010As0.990 exhibits an initial shift to\nhigher energy as the temperature is raised from 78 to 175 K,\nFIG. 1.

The solid lines follow the PL peak position, while the dashed\nand dotted lines indicate the positions of the free exciton and localized\nexciton peaks, respectively, in the PL spectra recorded below 175 K.\nDownloaded 30 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject tofollowed by a shift to lower energy between 200 and 293 K.\nThis blueshift followed by redshift is due to localization of\nelectrons in potential fluctuations, originating from the ran-\ndom N distribution in the alloy.3 At low temperatures, the\nbroad PL peak is composed of contributions from localized\nexcitons \u0001LE\u0002 and free excitons \u0001FE\u0002. The variation of the PL\nspectra with increasing temperature is indicative of carrier\ndetrapping from localized to extended states.16 As the tem-\nperature is increased, the PL peak initially narrows due to the\nreduction in the intensity of the LE peak with respect to the\nFE peak. The PL peak reaches its lowest FWHM at 175 K,\nbefore increasing again due to the thermalization of the\ncarriers.17 Also above \u0005175 K, only the FE peak is present\nand the PL peak redshift is solely associated with the reduc-\ntion of the band gap with increasing temperature.\nThe PL from the InN0.022As0.978 sample exhibits a similar\ntrend to the lower N content, but with less separation be-\ntween the LE and FE peaks. From the highest nitrogen con-\ntent sample, InN0.028As0.972, only a weak PL peak originating\nfrom the InAs substrate was observed. The lack of PL from\nthis alloy is attributed to the poorer crystal quality of this\nepilayer, as indicated by the broader XRD peak.\nThe position of the free exciton PL peak \u0001closed sym-\nbols\u0002 as a function of temperature for each of the samples is\nplotted in Fig. 3, along with the PL peak position \u0001open\nsymbols\u0002 where this differs from that of the free exciton\npeak. At a given temperature, as the N content is increased\nthe FE PL peak position decreases in energy. This provides\nunambiguous evidence of the N-induced band gap reduction\nin InNAs alloys. The line through the InAs data points is\nfrom Varshni\u2019s relation for the temperature dependence of\nthe band gap,18 using Eg\u00010\u0002=430 meV \u0001while Vurgaftman\net al. recommend the value Eg\u00010\u0002=417 meV, they report that\nthe literature values range from 410 to 450 meV\u0002 and the\nVarshni parameters A=0.276 meV\/K and B=93 K.19 The\nlines through the InNxAs1\u2212x data points represent the calcu-\nlated temperature dependence of the band gap.

This interaction results\nin the formation of two nonparabolic subbands E+ and E\u2212,\nwith the band gap then being the separation between the\nvalence band maximum and the E\n\u2212\nsubband minmum.\nThe evolution of the E\u00b1 subband edges with nitrogen\ncontent, x, can be determined by finding the eigenvalues of\n\u0006E \u2212 EN\u0001x\u0002 \u0006x1\/2\n\u0006x1\/2 E \u2212 Ec0 \u2212 \u0003x\n\u0006 , \u00011\u0002\nwhere \u0003=1.30 eV \u0001Ref. 20\u0002 is the parameter of the term\ndescribing the linear variation of the conduction band edge\nwith N content, \u0006=1.30 eV \u0001Ref. 20\u0002 is the parameter of the\nterm describing the interaction between the N resonant state\nand the conduction band edge, EN\u0001x\u0002 is the effective N level\nwith respect to the valence band maximum, and Ec0 is the\nhost conduction band edge.21 However, this becomes a\n5\u00015 Hamiltonian when conventional k\u00b7p theory is included\nto account for the intrinsic nonparabolicity of the host InAs.\nThe temperature dependence of the host band gap was de-\nscribed by the same Varshni parameters as used to produce\nthe line through the InAs data points in Fig. 3. The change\nin the effective N level due to the increased concentration of\nN pairs with increasing x content is accounted for by\nEN\u0001x\u0002=EN0\u2212\u0007x,\n15\nwhere EN0 =1.48 eV is the isolated N\nresonant state and \u0007=2.00 eV.20\nThe parameters for the k\u00b7p Hamiltonian were deter-\nmined by fitting the resulting E\u00b1 subbands to the tight bind-\ning band structure of InNxAs1\u2212x. Details of the tight binding\ncalculation can be found elsewhere.15 However, to fit the\nexperimental variation of the FE PL peak, the value of EN0\nhad to be changed from the tight binding value of 1.36 eV. A\nvalue of 1.48 eV was used, in agreement with that obtained\nby Shih et al.7 Using the BAC model,1 the experimental data\nare reproduced when the nitrogen level and coupling param-\neter have the values EN0 =1.48 eV \u0001with \u0007=2.00 eV\u0002 and\nCMN=1.77 eV, respectively. This value of CMN is between\nthose of 1.68 and 1.86 eV reported by Shih et al.7 and\nKuroda et al.,8 respectively, obtained from fitting the N con-\ntent dependence of the absorption edge after correcting for\nMoss-Burstein shift.\nDownloaded 30 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132.
