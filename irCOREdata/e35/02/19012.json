The Government has pro-\nmoted self-care on the basis that the public favour more\ncontrol over their health [1] and self-care improves health\noutcomes and appropriate use of health and social care\nservices [2].\nDiagnostic self-tests for over 20 conditions can be bought\nin pharmacies or over the internet [3]. Some provide\nresults at home or a sample is sent to a laboratory and\nresults are returned by post or email. Either way, people\nwho self-test do not need to discuss why they decided to\nhave the test or the results with a clinician. Members of the\npublic may consider that using self-tests is self-care and,\ntherefore, desirable, but direct access to self-tests has the\npotential to reduce or reinforce inequity. People who can\nafford a test may simply wish to check on their health, for\nexample with a home cholesterol test, and this could free\nup conventional services for other people. Alternatively,\npeople who are unable to communicate their needs to a\nhealth professional could buy expensive and perhaps\nundesirable tests for home use. It is, therefore, important\nto understand who uses self-tests so that targeted educa-\ntion about appropriate testing can be provided and equi-\ntable access to corresponding conventional services can be\nassured. Our aim was to generate hypotheses about who\nuses self-tests by reviewing evidence for factors that are\nassociated with self-testing and, because of a lack of evi-\ndence about self-tests, similar activities.\nMethods\nScope of the review\nOther than self-testing, activities under review were use of\nover-the-counter (OTC) medicine, private care, comple-\nmentary and alternative therapies (CAM), and home\nblood pressure (BP) monitors. These were chosen because\nthey can be initiated without the involvement or recom-\nmendation of a conventional health professional and this\nis a defining feature of self-testing. Furthermore, they usu-\nally necessitate the user taking an active role, for example\nvisiting a pharmacy, similar to buying a self-test. The\nreview was restricted to studies about the United Kingdom\n(UK) because use of these activities is likely to be related\nto the accessibility of the health care system. The review\nwas also restricted to studies published in the last 15 years\nbecause the availability of the activities will have altered as\nfashions and technologies have changed.\nSearch strategy\nA search strategy was designed for each activity: for exam-\nple, to look for studies about self-test use, titles of papers\nwere searched for the terms \"self diagnos$\" or \"self test$\"\nor \"home test$\" or \"home diagnos$\", where $ denotes\ntruncated terms. This was then adapted for each database\n(table 1): for example, databases where MeSH headings\nare assigned to papers were searched using appropriate\nheadings, such as \"self medication\" to look for studies\nabout OTC medicine use. Searches were conducted during\nApril 2007, but Medline was searched again in July 2008\nfor more recently published papers about self-testing.\nWhere many papers were returned, searches were refined\nwith filters to identify appropriate study designs: for\nexample, titles were searched for terms such as \"factor$\"\nor \"characteristic$\", and databases where MeSH headings\nare assigned were searched using headings such as \"Epide-\nmiologic Studies\" or \"Health Surveys\". Filters to identify\nstudies conducted in the UK were also used: the title,\nabstract, institution and country of publication were\nsearched for \"UK\", \"United Kingdom\", \"GB\", \"Britain\"\nand the constituent countries. Finally, where possible,\nsearches were limited to studies involving humans, writ-\nten in the English language, and published from 1993 to\n2007. As studies related to private care could have been\npublished in economic as well as medical journals, The\nJournal of Health Economics, The Journal of Public Eco-\nnomics and The Economic Journal were hand-searched.\nReferences of eligible papers were also reviewed.\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nAbstracts of potentially relevant studies were reviewed.\nWhere it was unclear whether the study was eligible, the\npaper was retrieved and assessed. Studies were included if\nthey were published during the last 15 years in a peer-\nreviewed journal and they reported factors, reasons or\ncharacteristics associated with a relevant activity among\nadults resident in the UK.\nStudies were excluded if they did not concern a relevant\nactivity or report factors, reasons or characteristics associ-\nated with an activity. Remaining studies were then\nexcluded: if they did not involve adults or did not differ-\nentiate between children and adults; if they specified that\nthe activity was initiated by a doctor or nurse; if they only\nstudied intention or willingness to do an activity; if they\ninvolved people with specific conditions where the results\nwould not be generalisable; or if they did not involve UK\nresidents or differentiate between residents of the UK and\nother countries. Finally, reviews, letters or opinions were\nexcluded, although reviews were retrieved so that relevant\nreferences could be identified.\nQuality assessment\nProformas based on tools from the Critical Appraisal\nSkills Programme [4,5] were used. The quantitative pro-\nforma included questions about whether the results of the\nstudy were likely to be valid, for example whether the\nstudy population was recruited appropriately (additional\nfile 1). The qualitative proforma included questions aboutPage 2 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2009, 9:96 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/9\/96\nPage 3 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nTable 1: Number of potentially relevant papers identified and number of these papers that were eligible by activity and databasea.\nSubject Complementary and \nalternative medicine (CAM)\nOver-the-counter \n(OTC) medicine\nPrivate care Home blood pressure \n(BP) monitors\nSelf-tests Totalb\nDatabase Inc.

Each paper was given\na score out of ten by two reviewers with discrepancies\nresolved by discussion. Papers with scores of eight or\nmore were termed high quality, papers with scores of\nmore than five but less than eight were termed medium\nquality, and papers with scores of five or less were termed\nlow quality. Low quality publications were included to\ngive a complete picture and because such studies could\nindicate areas where higher quality research is needed.\nAnother proforma was used to extract information from\neligible papers.\nResults\nTwo hundred and six potentially relevant papers were\nidentified in April 2007: 49 were eligible (table 1) and\n157 were excluded (table 2). Medline identified most (n =\n28) eligible papers. Embase identified the next highest\nnumber (n = 18), but there was considerable overlap with\nMedline: adding Embase only identified three more\npapers, whereas the Applied Social Sciences Index and\nAbstracts and PsycINFO databases both identified five\nmore papers.\nComplementary and alternative medicine\nEligible papers\nThirty eligible papers were identified. Three were also\nidentified in searches related to OTC medicine: one\nlooked at practitioner-delivered and OTC treatments and\nthe former results are presented in this section [6],\nwhereas the other two did not make this distinction and\nall their results are discussed here [7,8]. Another paper\nwas also identified in searches related to private care: the\nresults are presented in this section as the study involved\nCAM patients [9]. This study and two others were reported\nacross two papers [7,9-13], leaving 27 studies (additional\nfile 3).\nEligible studies looked at different therapies, for example\nacupuncture [14] or alternative medicines not prescribed\nby a doctor [15], during different periods, for example\never [7,13] or currently [14]. One study involved inter-\nviews [16], one was a qualitative survey [17], three used\nquestionnaires plus interviews [9,10,18,19], and one was\na case note review [20]. Twenty one studies were question-\nnaire surveys, but only seven of them used population-\nbased samples, for example people registered with general\npractices [11,12]. The remainder used selected samples,\nfor example people visiting a practitioner [14].\nOne questionnaire survey had a high quality score\n[11,12], 18 had medium scores, and two had low scores\n[21,22]. Three qualitative studies had medium scores\n[16,17,19] and two had low scores [9,10,18].\nResults\nUsing adjusted analyses, the high quality population-\nbased survey found that being female was linked with vis-\niting a CAM practitioner in the last three months [11,12],\na medium quality population-based survey reported that\ntaking non-prescribed alternative medicines was more\nlikely in women than men [15], and another medium\nquality study found that lifetime CAM use was more likely\namong female than male GP attendees [7,13]. Although\nsamples and analysis methods varied, 10 other studies\nreported a link between being female and CAM use\n[6,14,17,18,20,23-27].\nUsing adjusted analyses, the high quality population-\nbased survey found that people aged 34\u201349 were most\nlikely to consult a chiropractor or osteopath [11,12], and\na medium quality survey found that past CAM use was\nmore likely among GP attendees under 70 than older\nattendees [7,13]. Three medium quality population-based\nsurveys used unadjusted analyses to show that use was\nmost common among people aged 45\u201364 [6], 35\u201364 [24]\nand 45\u201354 [28], and another medium quality study\ndescribed higher proportions of acupuncture patients\nbeing aged 35\u201364 than the general population [14]. Two\nmedium quality surveys described that CAM users were\nmost commonly aged 30\u201349 [23] and 35\u201344 [17], and\nanother medium quality study described CAM patients as\nhaving a median age of about 45 [20]. A low quality pop-\nulation-based survey described a peak in use at age 45\n[18]. Three further studies looked at age but compared\npeople visiting CAM practitioners with GP and\/or outpa-\ntient attendees [25,29,30].\nOnly three medium quality studies looked at ethnic ori-\ngin. Using an adjusted analysis, one found that people of\nBlack African origin were more likely than white people or\npeople of South Asian origin to take non-prescribed alter-\nnative medicines [15]. Another reported that white stu-\ndents did not have a tradition of CAM use, although the\nanalysis was limited by small numbers [19]. In contrast,\nthe third found that most patients at a CAM hospital were\nwhite, although there was no comparison group [26].\nUsing population-based surveys and adjusted analyses, a\nhigh quality and a medium quality study found, respec-\ntively, that people from higher social classes were more\nlikely to have visited a CAM practitioner in the past three\nmonths [11,12] or be taking non-prescribed alternative\nmedicines [15] than other people. Using unadjusted anal-\nyses, two medium quality population-based surveys\nfound that CAM use was more common among affluent\nthan non-affluent groups [24,28], and another medium\nquality study reported that use was more common among\nGP attendees with higher incomes [7,13]. Two medium\nquality studies found that CAM patients had higherPage 4 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2009, 9:96 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/9\/96incomes [29] or occupational status [25] than GP\npatients, although again analyses were unadjusted. A fur-\nther medium quality study described people visiting a\nChinese medicine practitioner as having disposable\nincome [20].\nThree medium quality studies linked education and CAM\nuse, although they all used unadjusted analyses. A popu-\nlation-based survey found that use was more likely among\npeople who were older than younger when they left edu-\ncation [28]. Another found that use was more common\namong GP attendees with higher than lower educational\nattainment [7,13]. The third study found that CAM\npatients generally had a longer education than GP\npatients [31].\nA link with poor health was supported by several studies.\nUsing adjusted analyses, the high quality population-\nbased survey found that people with a long-standing ill-\nness or who saw their GP more often were more likely to\nhave seen a CAM practitioner recently than other people\n[11,12], and a medium quality study found that CAM\npatients were more likely than GP patients to have psychi-\natric morbidity [29]. Using unadjusted analyses, a low\nquality population-based survey found that CAM users\nhad higher GP attendance rates and were more likely to\nhave severe or chronic conditions than non-users [18],\nand two medium quality studies found that CAM patients\nwere more likely than GP patients to have had a serious\nillness [30], chronic illness [30] and longer illness [30,32].\nTwo medium quality studies also looked at symptom\nlength: one described most Chinese medicine patients as\nhaving symptoms for over a year [20], and the other\ndescribed new CAM patients as having longer symptoms\nthan GP patients, although CAM patients also had lower\npain scores [31].\nSome studies described reasons for using CAM, for exam-\nple an acquaintance's recommendation [9,10,33] or\nbecause a family member had done so [8]. Others cited\nusers' views about orthodox medicine's disadvantages, for\nexample rushed appointments [9,10] and its limited effec-\ntiveness [9,10,16,27], compared with CAM's attractions,\nfor example its effectiveness [27] and sensitive practition-\ners with time to listen [30].\nThe high quality population-based survey reported that\nnon-smokers and people who took regular exercise were\nmore likely to have seen a chiropractor or osteopath than\nother people [11,12]. Two medium quality studies with\nadjusted analyses also reported a link with healthy living:\ncompared to GP patients, CAM patients had healthier life-\nstyles [30] and were more likely to believe in healthy liv-\ning [29]. Similar to this, a low quality unadjusted survey\nfound that patients at alternative therapy centres were\nmore likely to be health conscious and know about health\nthan health centre attendees [21]. A medium [29] and a\nlow quality study [21] also reported that CAM users were\nmore likely to believe that they controlled their health or\nless likely to believe that doctors controlled their health\nthan users of orthodox medicine.\nOver-the-counter medicine\nEligible studies\nFifteen eligible papers relating to 15 studies were identi-\nfied. Two are discussed in the CAM section [7,8], leaving\n13 studies (additional file 4). The studies looked at use or\npurchase of any or specific medicines, such as analgesics\n[34]. Two were qualitative studies [35,36] and 11 were\nsurveys. Four surveys used population-based samples\n[6,34,37,38], for example from health authority registers.\nOne survey sampled people who were shopping [39] and\ntwo sampled people attending general practices [40,41].\nThe remaining four surveys looked at OTC purchasers\nwithout a comparison group [42-45]. Four surveys\n[34,37,38,40] had high quality scores. Three surveys\n[6,39,41] and the two qualitative studies [35,36] had\nmedium scores. The other four surveys had low scores\n[42-45].\nResults\nTwo low quality surveys described the sex of purchasers of\nOTC medicines and found that most were female [44,45].\nFour population-based surveys agreed that use or pur-\nchase was more common in females: three were high\nquality and used adjusted analyses [34,37,38] and one\nwas medium quality but unadjusted [6]. Using unad-\njusted analyses, a high quality survey of GP attendees [40]\nand a medium quality survey of shoppers [39] also found\nthat being female was linked with using or purchasing\nOTC medicines.\nOne high quality population-based survey reported on\nethnicity: this found that people who were white were\nmore likely to use herbal supplements than other people\n[37]. Most studies looked at age. Three high quality pop-\nulation-based surveys found, using adjusted analyses, that\npurchase or use of OTC medicines was more common in\npeople aged 35\u201344 [38], 45\u201364 [37], and under 60 [34].\nOne medium quality adjusted survey found that GP\nattendees [41] aged under 60 were more likely to use OTC\nmedicines than older people, and another medium qual-\nity unadjusted survey reported a similar result for shop-\npers [39]. Using unadjusted analyses, a high quality\nsurvey of GP attendees [40] and a medium quality popu-\nlation-based survey [6] found that use or purchase of OTC\nmedicines was highest in the 45\u201364 age group, and two\nlow quality surveys reported that most OTC buyers were\n46\u201360 [44] or 36\u201345 years [45].Page 5 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2009, 9:96 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/9\/96Three high quality population-based surveys [34,37,38],\none high quality survey of GP attendees [40] and one\nmedium quality survey of GP attendees [41] found that\nOTC medicine use or purchase was associated with afflu-\nence. The studies used different measures though, for\nexample occupation [38] or the Carstairs deprivation cat-\negory [34], and only two found the association after\nadjusting for other variables [37,38]. One of the high\nquality surveys also reported an association with educa-\ntional attainment, but only education remained signifi-\ncant in the adjusted analysis [34]. This could suggest that\nthe association with affluence may be related to educa-\ntion, but there was also a link with paying for prescrip-\ntions in the adjusted analysis and this could be a surrogate\nfor affluence. A low quality but adjusted survey of phar-\nmacy customers also found an association with paying for\nprescriptions [43], and two medium quality unadjusted\nanalyses of GP attendees [41] and shoppers [39] reported\na similar link.\nOnly three studies found a link between purchase or use\nof OTC medicines and poor health, but all were high qual-\nity population-based studies with adjusted analyses. Two\nstudies looked at self-reported health [34,38] and the\nthird looked at psychiatric morbidity [37].\nTwo high quality population-based surveys examined\nbehaviour. One found that herbal supplement use was\nassociated with not smoking and being active, although\nonly being active remained significant after adjusting for\nother variables [37]. This suggests that use may be associ-\nated with healthy behaviours. The other survey found an\nunadjusted association between non-prescription analge-\nsics and drinking alcohol, but the comparison was with\nnon-drinkers so this is probably not a healthy behaviour\n[34].\nSome low quality surveys described reasons for OTC use,\nfor example a prompt by an acquaintance [45], habit [44],\nhomeopathic remedies being more natural [45], or symp-\ntoms not being severe enough for the doctor [42]. Some\nof these reasons were echoed in the qualitative studies, for\nexample experience and influence of family members\n[35], doctors being unable to help with some problems\n[36], and prescription medicines being chemical [36].\nPrivate sector\nEligible studies\nSeven eligible papers were identified. One was also iden-\ntified in searches related to CAM and is discussed in the\nCAM section [9]. The remaining six papers related to six\nstudies (additional file 5). Five studies using data col-\nlected during surveys to look at determinants of insurance\n[46-48] and who actually uses private care [49,50]. The\nsixth study used data from general practice records to look\nat who was most likely to be privately referred [51]. The\nstudy that used general practice data had a high quality\nscore [51], three studies had medium scores [47,48,50],\nand two had low scores [46,49].\nResults\nOne medium quality study, using an adjusted analysis,\nreported that women were less likely to have private insur-\nance than men [47]. A link with age was found in four\nstudies. The high quality study used an adjusted analysis\nto show that people aged 45\u201354 were most likely to be pri-\nvately referred [51]. Another medium quality study, also\nusing an adjusted analysis, found that private insurance\nincreased with age but fell for older people [48]. A low\nquality study reported the same result [46], although it\nwas unclear if the analysis was adjusted. In contrast, a\nmedium quality study, using an adjusted analysis, found\nthat private insurance increased with age [47].\nPrivate care or insurance was positively associated with\naffluence and\/or negatively associated with deprivation in\nall the studies. The high quality study [51] and two\nmedium quality studies [47,48] used adjusted analyses,\nwhereas the other medium quality study used an unad-\njusted analysis [50] and it was unclear if the two low qual-\nity studies had adjusted for other variables [46,49]. The\nmeasures used, for example income [46] or the Index of\nMultiple Deprivation [51], also varied.\nBeing privately insured was found to be more likely\namong people with than without a basic qualification in\na medium quality study that used an adjusted analysis\nincluding the possible confounders of income and occu-\npation [47]. A similar link was found in a low quality\nstudy, but it was unclear whether the analysis was\nadjusted [46].\nOnly one study reported on the relationship with health\nstatus [49]. This reported a negative association between\nprivate care and being limited in one's daily activities, but\nthe study was low quality and it was unclear if the analysis\nwas adjusted.\nHome blood pressure monitors\nOne eligible medium quality survey of 5545 people regis-\ntered with general practices (54% response rate: 153 ques-\ntionnaires undelivered and 2925 completed) was\nidentified [52]. Being retired (p < 0.05), being not in\nemployment (p < 0.05), having a long-term illness (p <\n0.001) and\/or not good health (p < 0.05), being a non-\nsmoker (p < 0.01), and having used other self-tests (p <\n0.0001) were linked with self-testing for high BP but only\nin a univariate analysis. Increasing age (p < 0.0001), being\nfemale (p < 0.0001), having a degree (p < 0.05) and livingPage 6 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2009, 9:96 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/9\/96in a more affluent area (p < 0.05) remained significant\nafter adjusting for other variables.\nSelf-tests\nOne eligible paper about self-testing was identified in July\n2008 [53]. This presented results for self-tests related to\ncancer from the survey of 5545 adults that had been iden-\ntified in searches related to home BP monitors [52]. Using\nan adjusted analysis, the study found that predictors of\nuse of a prostate specific antigen test were being male (p <\n0.01), white ethnicity (p < 0.01) and older age (p < 0.01),\nand that use was lower among relatively deprived people\n(quartile 3 of the Index of Multiple Deprivation, p <\n0.001). In contrast, use of a haematuria test was predicted\nby being relatively deprived (p < 0.05), as well as giving\none's employment status as looking after the home and\/\nor family (p < 0.01).\nDiscussion\nMain findings of this study\nThis study reviewed evidence for factors that are associ-\nated with self-testing and similar activities among UK\nadults. Forty nine eligible papers were identified. Most (n\n= 28) were identified by Medline and most (n = 30) were\nrelated to CAM. There were 46 unique studies and most (n\n= 36) had high or medium quality scores. Most (n = 37)\nstudies were, or used data from established questionnaire\nsurveys, but only 16 of them were population-based. Sur-\nvey analysis methods varied from simple descriptive to\nadjusted analyses, but studies generally looked at five\nareas \u2013 demographic factors (sex and age), affluence\/dep-\nrivation, education, health status, and health behaviours\nand beliefs.\nBeing female was associated with the activity in 13 of 27\nstudies about CAM, eight of 13 studies about OTC medi-\ncine, and the only study about home BP monitors. Ten\nstudies about CAM, nine studies about OTC medicine,\nand three studies about the private sector reported that\npeople in the 30 to 64 year age range were most likely to\nundertake the activity or that use declined after 60 or 70\nyears. One study, however, found that private insurance\nwas more common in men than women and as age\nincreased [47], and the study about home BP monitors\nreported that use became more likely as age increased\n[52].\nA link with affluence was presented in eight studies about\nCAM, five studies about OTC medicine, all six studies\nabout the private sector, and the study about home BP\nmonitors. Higher educational attainment was associated\nwith use in three studies about CAM, one study about\nOTC medicine, two studies about the private sector and\nthe study about home BP monitors. Education and afflu-\nence are likely to be associated though and many studies\nused unadjusted analyses or looked at education or afflu-\nence. Even so, no study found that the activity was less\ncommon in more affluent or educated people.\nSix studies about CAM, three studies about OTC medi-\ncine, and the study about home BP monitors suggested a\nlink with various measures of poor health, but the analy-\nses were often unadjusted. Conflicting evidence was also\npresented by two studies: one found that CAM patients\nhad longer symptoms than GP patients but also lower\npain scores [31], and the other reported that private care\nwas less likely among people limited in their daily activi-\nties than among those not limited [49].\nFour studies about CAM and one about OTC medicine\nsuggested a link with healthy lifestyles or being health\nconscious and knowledgeable about health, and no stud-\nies contradicted this. Two studies also found that CAM\nusers were more likely to believe that they control their\nhealth or less likely to believe that doctors control their\nhealth than users of orthodox medicine.\nWhat is already known on this topic\nThe aim of this study was to review evidence about who\nuses self-tests among UK adults. No relevant studies about\nself-testing were initially identified though. As a result, the\nscope was widened to look at similar activities, and this\nstudy is the first to draw together evidence from different\nareas about common factors that are associated with self-\ncare activities.\nWhat this study adds\nPeople who use CAM and OTC medicine appear similar.\nThere is general consensus that they are usually female,\nmiddle-aged and affluent and\/or educated. There is also\nfairly general agreement that people who undertake these\nactivities have some measure of poor health. People who\nuse home BP monitors appear similar to people who use\nCAM and OTC medicine except that use was associated\nwith increasing age. The study about home BP monitors\ndid not ask about hypertension though, and rising use\ncould be related to the increased prevalence of this condi-\ntion with age, perhaps unlike other conditions for which\nCAM and OTC medicines are used.\nSimilar to CAM, OTC medicines and home BP monitors,\npeople who use the private sector appear to be affluent\nand\/or educated. In contrast to users of other activities\nthough, there is some evidence that males tend to have\nprivate insurance and people with good health tend to\nhave private care. This suggests that it may not be appro-\npriate to group studies about the private sector with stud-\nies about other self-care activities.Page 7 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2009, 9:96 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/9\/96Limitations of this study\nOnly studies conducted in the UK were included because\nit was felt that the health care environment would have\naffected choices about the activities under consideration.\nThe review may not, therefore, be applicable to other set-\ntings.\nAs there was no clear equivalent activity, studies about\nactivities with similarities to self-testing were reviewed.\nEach activity, however, also has differences to self-testing,\nfor example CAM is generally considered to be outside\nconventional medicine, whereas self-tests could be con-\nsidered an extension of orthodox medicine. There were\nalso differences between the activities, and grouping\ntogether results from such studies may not be appropriate,\nfor example people who use the private sector may be dif-\nferent to people who use the other activities. As only one\nstudy about home BP monitors and self-tests was identi-\nfied, it is probably not appropriate to draw firm conclu-\nsions about users of these activities.\nSelf-tests were defined for this study as tests that are\nbought and used without involving a doctor, nurse or\nother conventional health professional. As a result, stud-\nies were excluded where there was evidence that the activ-\nity was always initiated by a conventional health\nprofessional. Activities could also be simply recom-\nmended by health professionals though, and this was\noften not asked about or, if asked about, used to group\npeople. It was not possible, therefore, to determine\nwhether people who used an activity after a conventional\nprofessional's recommendation were different to people\nwho used them without any such recommendation. Sim-\nilar to this, use of private care and some CAM facilities\nmay require referral from a conventional health profes-\nsional, but the idea may have come from the patient.\nAgain though, this was often not reported or used to\ngroup people. This may be important as someone who is\naffluent and\/or educated may be more able to influence a\nGP to arrange a referral, which could, at least, partly\nexplain the link between affluence and the use of these\nactivities.\nEligible studies often defined use in different ways. Iden-\ntified studies also used different data collection and anal-\nysis methods. Questionnaire surveys were often not\npopulation-based or did not have a relevant comparison\ngroup so descriptive analyses were presented about the\ngroup using the activity. Even where there was a compari-\nson, analyses were often not adjusted for confounding\nvariables so it was difficult to see if associations, such as\neducation and affluence, were independent. Factors exam-\nined also varied widely, even though more basic charac-\nteristics, such as ethnic group, were infrequently studied.\nIt was also sometimes difficult to tell whether papers\nrelated to the same study, for example three papers used\nsimilar methods and the same authors, but the number of\nparticipants varied [27,30,32]. These issues meant that it\nwas not possible to formally pool analyses from studies\nwithin each area.\nFuture research\nThe government is encouraging self-care because of evi-\ndence that this will improve health outcomes and appro-\npriate use of conventional services. The promotion of self-\ncare may mean that self-tests are seen as desirable. It will\nbe important, therefore, given the potential disadvantages\nof self-tests, to assess the impact of this policy on their use.\nThere is a lack of evidence about who currently uses self-\ntests and why they use them though and a need for\nresearch in this area. It seemed sensible to collate evidence\nfrom studies about similar activities as a starting point,\nbut it remains important, particularly given the potential\ndisadvantages of self-tests, to use this knowledge to\ndirectly study who is using self-tests and why they are\nbeing used. The evidence from this review will, therefore,\nbe used to design a questionnaire to look at factors that\nare associated with using self-tests. This review will also be\nuseful to policy makers wishing to consider how best to\npromote general self-care activities by highlighting those\ngroups who are not engaged in such activities. Further\nqualitative research among these groups about why self-\ncare is not used and how this could be facilitated would\nbe useful.\nConclusion\nThis review suggests that people who engaged in self-care\nactivities were likely to be affluent and\/or educated. Self-\ncare is, therefore, likely to require targeted promotion to\nensure that use is equitable.\nPeople who have used some self-care activities may also\nhave poorer health than non-users or people attending\nconventional services. It seems reasonable that people\nwould use self-care activities when they feel unwell, but it\nis important to ensure that self-care is not a second choice\nfor people who have been dissatisfied with, or not had\ntheir needs met by conventional services. There is weak\nevidence that dissatisfaction with orthodox medicine was\na factor in some people's decision to use CAM and that\nsome people used OTC medicine because their doctor was\nunable to help them. This requires further investigation as\npart of the evaluation of the promotion of self-care.\nAbbreviations\nOTC: over-the-counter; CAM: complementary and alter-\nnative therapies; BP: blood pressure; UK: United King-\ndom.Page 8 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2009, 9:96 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/9\/96Competing interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nAR, SW and SG were responsible for the overall design of\nthe study and designed the search strategy.
