This growth, low labor costs and a fast developing\ndomestic market (Chan et al, 1997) have all led to significant foreign investment in\nthe People\u2019s Republic of China. Consequently, more than one hundred Fortune 500\ncompanies have operations in China, and many other businesses have also invested\n(Lu and Wang, 1996). Over 14 million Chinese are employed in enterprises created or\nsupported by foreign investment (Management World, 1996a) and many of these are\ninternational joint ventures (IJVs) in the manufacturing sector (Schroath et al, 1993).\nAs a result of the high level of foreign investment in Chinese manufacturing, over\n50% of manufactured goods exported from China in 1994 came from enterprises\nsupported by foreign investment (Management World, 1996a). Therefore, IJVs have\nsignificant production capacity but, surprisingly, few studies have been made of\noperations management issues in China.\nInvestments in manufacturing in China are often made because of the strategic\nbenefits they can bring. However, IJV manufacturing operations in China do not\nalways perform effectively. For example, problems have been reported at many\nmanufacturing IJVs (Management World, 1996a, 1996b; Han and Xu, 1995), many\nforeign partners are dissatisfied (Beamish, 1993), and failures are common (Robb and\nXie, 1999). Much of this dissatisfaction is related to problems in managing operations.\nFor example, IJV partners often have different expectations, achieving high-quality\nproduction is difficult, and finding good local suppliers is challenging (Bruijn and Jia,\n1993). Although both Western and Chinese management researchers have\ninvestigated the strategic aspects of IJVs; they have largely ignored operations (Zhang\n3and Goffin, 1999). Consequently, operational issues warrant investigation, including\nsupplier management (ibid).\nThis paper focuses on supplier management at IJV manufacturers in China and\nthe research aimed to:\n\uf0b7 Investigate supplier management at an exploratory sample of companies\n\uf0b7 Identify the most important contextual factors influencing the development of\neffective supplier management and determine key lessons for operations managers\nin China\nThe results of the research have strong implications for all companies operating in\nChina\u2014who will face the need to effectively manage \u201cthe transition\u201d to local\nsuppliers. However, before these results are presented a short review of the supplier\nmanagement literature will be given, followed by a detailed explanation of the\nresearch methodology.\nSUPPLIER MANAGEMENT\nSupplier management has been defined as \u201corganizing the optimal flow of\nhigh-quality, value-for-money materials or components to manufacturing companies\nfrom a suitable set of innovative suppliers\u201d (Goffin, et al, 1997). Practitioners have\nrecognized that suppliers play a vital role in improving manufacturing performance\n(Monczka et al, 1998). This is because effective supplier management reduces costs\n(Asmus and Griffin, 1993; Christopher, 1997; Davis, 1993) and leads to higher quality\n(Burt, 1989; Larson, 1994). Other benefits include better delivery performance\n(Christopher, 1998) and support for new product development (Ragatz et al, 1997);\nboth of which lead to competitive advantage (Monczka et al, 1993). Supplier\n4management has attracted the interest of researchers and, from a review of the\nliterature, five main areas were identified as pertinent to the current research:\n\uf0b7 Supplier selection and evaluation\n\uf0b7 Sourcing strategy\n\uf0b7 Developing relationships with suppliers\n\uf0b7 Contextual issues influencing supplier management\n\uf0b7 Supplier management in Chinese IJVs.\nSupplier Selection and Evaluation\nThe term supplier base refers to a manufacturer\u2019s total number of suppliers (Monczka\net al, 1998; Goffin et al, 1997) and a key recent trend has been to reduce this number\n(Christopher 1998). Many companies in a number of sectors have adopted this\napproach (Lamming 1993; Goffin et al, 1997), because a smaller supplier base allows\nthem to focus on obtaining top performance from their remaining suppliers (Asmus\nand Griffin, 1993).\nSupplier selection is an issue that is relevant to both practitioners and\nresearchers (Pearson and Ellram, 1995) and the criteria used to choose suppliers are a\nfundamental part of this process. Traditional approaches have prioritized price,\nquality and delivery (Smith et al, 1963), however, current thinking proposes a wider\nset of criteria (Lamming, 1993). Researchers have identified various new criteria,\nincluding the design capabilities of suppliers (Pearson and Ellram, 1995). Recent\nstudies have shown that manufacturers are using \u201csoft\u201d criteria\u2014such as the perceived\nquality of relationships\u2014and not just \u201chard\u201d criteria such as delivery performance\n(Choi and Hartley, 1996). The performance of chosen suppliers must be regularly\n5evaluated. Normally the criteria used for monitoring supplier performance are related\nto the selection criteria (Pearson and Ellram, 1995; Weber et al, 1998).\nDuring supplier selection, trade-off decisions are necessary (as some suppliers\nwill have high performance on certain criteria but lower performance on others).\nStudies in this area have largely been conceptual. For example, Min (1994) and\nBarbarosoblu and Yazgac (1997) developed models for making trade-off decisions.\nHowever, empirical support for the validity of such models is lacking and, in general,\ntrade-offs have received too little attention (Katsikeas and Leonidou, 1996).\nSourcing Stratgey\nRelated to supplier selection is sourcing strategy\u2014whether more than one supplier is\nrequired for each material or component. The possibilities include single-sourcing,\nmultiple-sourcing and single-active sourcing (where only one supplier normally\ndelivers parts but where another supplier is capable of supplying at short notice,\nshould problems arise). Goffin et al (1997) showed that manufacturers were reluctant\nto use single-sourcing because of the perceived risks. Richardson and Roumasset\n(1995) argued for multiple-sourcing, whereas others argue that single-sourcing is\npreferable in certain circumstances (e.g. Lau and Hurley, 1997; Weele, 1994). There\nare some contradictions in the literature on the relationship between sourcing strategy\nand selection criteria. Some research suggests that the sourcing strategy largely\ndetermines the choice of selection criteria (Swift, 1995). Other research implies that it\nis the past performance of suppliers, which influences a company\u2019s future sourcing\nstrategy (Min, 1994; Richardson and Roumasset, 1995; Pearson and Ellram, 1995).\n6Developing Relationships with Suppliers\nOnce suppliers have been selected, relationships need to be developed. Much of the\nprevious research has focused on the automotive industry and stems particularly from\nthe work of Lamming (e.g. 1993), who recognized the competitive advantages\nresulting from close buyer-supplier relationships\u2014partnerships. Dyer et al (1998)\nidentified two typical types of relationships, \u201carms-length\u201d and partnerships, and\nshowed the importance of only developing partnerships with suppliers of strategically\nimportant purchases.\nKrause and Ellram (1997) showed that manufacturers could raise suppliers\u2019\nperformance by setting challenging goals and actively assisting them to achieve these\ngoals. In another study, Hartley and Jones (1997) identified two different approaches\nto supplier development. They found that a \u201cprocess-oriented\u201d approach (in which a\nmanufacturer works closely with a supplier on process issues) was more effective than\na \u201cresults-oriented\u201d approach. Overall, the factors that determine whether partnerships\nwill be formed include the degree of mutual dependence, the extent of joint projects,\nthe approach to problem-solving, and the degree of economic satisfaction with the\nco-operation (Landeros et al, 1995; Monczka et al, 1995; Scott and Westbrook, 1991).\nIn any event, the literature clearly shows the importance of relationships in supplier\nmanagement.\nContextual Issues Influencing Supplier Management\nPrevious studies indicate the contextual nature of effective supplier management.\nMany factors influence manufacturers, including their size, the type of purchase\ninvolved and the competitive environment (Pearson and Ellram, 1995). In addition,\nfactors such as the organizational culture (Goffin et al, 1997); the national origin of\n7the organizations involved (Taylor and Wiggins, 1997; Chang and Kim, 1995); and\nthe nature of the political situation (Templin and Norffsinger, 1994) influence supplier\nmanagement. However, the nature of an industry and its competitive environment has\nthe greatest influence (Pearson and Ellram, 1995). Unraveling contextual influences is\ndifficult, complicated by the fact that most studies of supplier management have been\nin one sector (automotive) and the majority of empirical data is from the US.\nSupplier Management in Chinese IJVs\nAlthough few empirical studies have investigated the operations management issues\nfaced by IJVs in China (Zhang and Goffin, 1998), the trade and management press\nfrequently mentions difficulties with quality control (e.g. Business Asia, 1996);\nproduction capacity (e.g. Lerner, 1996); and supplier management (e.g. Business\nChina, 1993). Relationships with suppliers form a crucial part of IJV manufacturing\nmanagement in China (Martinsons and Tseng, 1995a and 1995b; Tsang, 1995)\nThe \u201csourcing of materials and components is a serious issue for IJVs in\nChina\u201d (Pan et al, 1995), and so IJVs often try to combine the strengths of their\nforeign and Chinese partners by integrating their different supply chains (Lu and\nWang, 1996; Yan and Gray, 1994). However, due to the quality problems with local\n(i.e. Chinese) suppliers, IJVs buy many of their materials overseas and this can lead to\nhigher-than-expected production costs (Campbell, 1989).\nA rare empirical study in China by Chao et al (1993) investigated supplier\nselection practices. It found that Chinese managers used similar criteria to Western\ncompanies in the selection of their suppliers. Although this paper gives an interesting\ninsight on selection criteria, it did not discuss how supplier relationships are\ndeveloped. In addition, it did not cover the contextual issues which others have\n8identified as important, such as local government (Chan, 1996), Guanxi\u2014personal\nconnections (Martinsons and Tseng, 1995a), and technology transfer (Bennett et al,\n1997).\nConclusions on Previous Research\nFrom the extant literature it can be seen that:\n\uf0b7 Supplier management is an increasingly important aspect of competitive\nmanufacturing.\n\uf0b7 Supplier management in Chinese IJVs is an important area for research, due to the\nprominence of this sector in China, the lack of previous research and the general\nneed for more understanding the contextual issues which influence on supplier\nmanagement practices.\n\uf0b7 Within an exploratory study, suppler selection, sourcing-strategy and development\nof relationships are all important topics to investigate\nConsequently, the central research question was: how do manufacturing IJVs in China\nselect their suppliers, and manage relationships with them?\nRESEARCH DESIGN\nChoice of Methodology\nThe research question was \u201chow\u201d in nature and, according to the classification of Yin\n(1989), the research is descriptive, exploratory and proposition generating. Possible\napproaches to such a research problem included a postal survey of purchasing\nmanagers at IJVs in China, or telephone discussions. However, the risk of low\nresponse rates and the complexity and emergent nature of the issues involved,\nweighed against these approaches. Therefore, the exploratory nature of the research\n9and the problems of conducting research with companies based in China (where\nresearchers may often be regarded with suspicion (Zhang and Goffin, 1999), led to the\nchoice of case study methodology. Case studies allow an objective, in-depth\nexamination of contemporary phenomena, where the investigator has little control\nover events (Yin, 1989). However, if they are rigorous and well designed, case studies\ncan offer a truly scientific research approach (McCutcheon and Meredith, 1993; Miles\nand Huberman, 1994).\nA multiple-case approach was selected, for which 4-6 cases are ideal in order\nto allow analytical generalization of the findings (Yin, 1989). To conduct effective\ncase studies, on-site visits were planned by a native Chinese speaker (one of the\nresearchers). These enabled manufacturing operations to be inspected, detailed\ndiscussions to be held with multiple informants (managers) and company\ndocumentation, products and processes to be seen first-hand. This made a range of\ndata available to the researchers. The visits were often deliberately spread over two\ndays, with an afternoon allocated to inspecting manufacturing facilities and building a\nrelationship with interviewees (i.e. reducing the levels of suspicion mentioned earlier),\nbefore the formal interviews were held on the second day.\nSources of Data\nThe primary interviewees were purchasing and materials managers and two or three\nmanagers were interviewed at each company. They were encouraged to talk openly by\nthe assurance of anonymity for their company and the formal interviews typically\nlasted one hour. During each interview detailed notes were taken and, if the\ninterviewee agreed, tape recordings were made to enable the use of direct quotes in\nthe data presentation. At two companies, additional interviews were possible with\n10\nother staff (e.g. an R&D engineer). Inspecting company documentation on\norganizations, purchasing processes, etc. enabled data triangulation. In all cases,\ntelephone discussions were held with the companies post-visit to clarify issues that\nrequired further exploration. In addition, case study descriptions were also checked\nfor accuracy by the interviewees.\nQuestionnaire Design\nA semi-structured questionnaire was developed for the interviews, based on the\nliterature, previous research by the authors (Zhang and Goffin, 1999), and covering\nfive areas:\n1) Company backgrounds and the role of supplier management (organizational\ndetails, the role of foreign partners and expatriate managers, etc.)\n2) Supplier selection and evaluation\n3) Sourcing strategy\n4) Developing relationships with suppliers\n5) Contextual issues (including the most important and problematical issues).\nTo ensure that the questions were easy to understand and relevant to managers, the\nquestionnaire was tested in pilot interviews with managers at one IJV manufacturer in\nBeijing. At the end of these interviews, interviewees were asked for their suggestions\nfor improving the questions and coverage of the different topics. A number of\nsuggestions were received and the questionnaire was modified appropriately. It should\nbe noted that mainly open-ended questions were used to capture managers\u2019 views and\nexperiences.\n11\nCase Study Sample\nLists of IJVs in China were obtained by visiting local government offices (e.g.\nForeign Trade Departments) in China. Details of more than 1,000 companies were\nobtained and from these, an exploratory sample of 40 IJV manufacturers was selected\nbased on five criteria. The IJVs selected had:\n\uf0b7 Run manufacturing operations in China for several years\n\uf0b7 Achieved a strong market position\n\uf0b7 Included a range of nationalities of foreign partners\n\uf0b7 Covered a range of industries\n\uf0b7 Operations which were reasonably accessible (to enable the fieldwork to be\ncost-effective)\nFrom the 40 companies contacted, nine agreed to co-operate in a larger study of\nsupplier management and five were selected for the exploratory study described in\nthis paper. All five had state-owned Chinese IJV partners because, as identified in the\nliterature, only public companies in China may form IJVs with international partners\n(Zhang and Goffin, 1999).\nData Analysis\nFollowing recommendations in the methodology literature (e.g. Miles and Huberman,\n1994), the case study analysis consisted of three stages: within-case data reduction\nusing the five categories used in the questionnaire; data display and cross-case\nanalysis; and drawing conclusions. To ensure the robustness of the analysis, data\nreduction and interpretation were performed following an independent review of the\ndata by each researcher. In addition, following the recommendations of Stake (1995),\n12\nas new issues became apparent from the data, the frame of analysis was accordingly\nchanged.\nRESULTS\nCompany Background Information\nAs the companies were promised anonymity they will be referred to as Switch-Co (a\nmanufacturer of digital switches); Telecom-Co (telephone equipment); TV-Tube-Co\n(TV tubes); Color-Dis-Co (color displays); and Eleva-Co (elevators). Table I gives\nthe main characteristics of each of these five companies and summarizes the results of\nthe cross-case analysis. A diverse sample is appropriate for exploratory studies and it\ncan be seen from Table I that the companies have various foreign partners (European,\nJapanese and US companies are all represented) and cover a range of industries. All\nfive IJVs are over 10 years old, have been in full production for several years and are\ncurrently among the market leaders in their sectors in China. For all of them, supplier\nmanagement is key\u2014purchased parts account for between 40 and 65 percent of costs\n(at the four companies that were willing to divulge data on manufacturing costs). In\naddition, the influence of suppliers on manufacturing performance was clear, for\nexample Switch-Co recognize that they will need to improve their supplier\nmanagement, in order to meet customer demands for faster delivery.\n(take in Table I)\nAs might be expected because of their greater experience in supplier\nmanagement, the foreign partners of all five case companies have played a leading\nrole in determining how suppliers are managed in the IJV. In each of the IJVs supplier\nmanagement was initially the responsibility of an expatriate from the international\npartner, and processes at the IJVs (such as selection procedures) were all based on the\n13\nforeign partner\u2019s approaches. This fact was identified by the interviewees and verified\nby inspection of IJV documentation. For example, the Assistant Manufacturing\nManager at Color-Dis-Co confirmed that in \u201cthis ... international alliance ... we\nChinese gain operations management experience from them [the Japanese partner]\u201d.\nSimilarly, a manager at Telecom-Co said, \u201cwe learn new skills and approaches [from\nthe international partner. Then]\u2026 we set up new directions for purchasing and\nsupplier management\u201d. In each of the IJVs, bilingual documentation was found that\nwas used in managing suppliers. These documents, which originated from the foreign\npartner, had been translated so that Chinese staff in the IJVs could apply the\nprocesses. This documentation made it easier for Chinese and foreign managers to\nwork together on supplier selection, for example.\nChinese managers now carry the main responsibility for purchasing and\nsupplier management in four out of the five case companies. In the remaining case\n(Color-Dis-Co), a Chinese assistant manager is working in close collaboration with an\nexpatriate-purchasing manager. Other departments, such as finance and technology\nmanagement, tend to be managed by expatriates. Therefore, it appears that foreign\npartners have recognized advantages of having a Chinese manager in charge of\nsupplier management because in their early years, all had expatriates in charge of\npurchasing. The Chinese interviewees reported that their organizational structures had\nbeen designed to promote close interaction with managers from the foreign partners.\nFor example, three of the Chinese purchasing managers (at Switch-Co, Telecom-Co,\nand Color-Dis-Co) report directly to a manager at the foreign partner. In addition,\nTelecom-Co has been integrated into its foreign partner\u2019s \u201cpurchasing group\u201d, which\nconsists of purchasing managers from their many subsidiaries and alliances. This\n14\ngroup works together with international suppliers to ensure competitive prices and\nquality.\nDespite the close links between Chinese managers and foreign executives, the\nforeign partners of Switch-Co and Color-Dis-Co maintain the power of veto over\nsupplier selection decisions. Therefore, they review all proposals made by the IJV on\nthe suitability of both local and overseas suppliers. Across the sample, it can be seen\nthat the foreign partner has largely determined how suppliers are managed by the IJV.\nSupplier Selection and Evaluation\nAll the five companies operate strict supplier selection, in terms of the criteria and\nprocedures used, and the emphasis placed on price, quality, delivery and payment\nconditions. The selection of suppliers typically takes place in three stages:\nStage 1: identifying and short-listing potential suppliers\nStage 2: assessing and approving qualified suppliers\nStage 3: keeping up supply performance of and modifying existing suppliers.\nEach IJV is constantly searching for and evaluating new suppliers. The selection\nprocess for local suppliers at each of the IJVs tends to be long, mainly because foreign\nIJV partners are skeptical about local suppliers\u2019 performance. At Switch-Co it takes\nabout eight to ten months and at Color-Dis-Co the process consumes around 2,000 to\n4,000 working hours. At Eleva-Co, it takes six to twelve months. A typical comment\nwas, the \u201cprocess of auditing suppliers is actually a process of training them\u2026 they\nhave gradually learnt new ideas and new methods... you never expect them to do\nthings perfectly at the beginning. It takes time to improve\u201d (Eleva-Co). In addition,\nmanagers at Switch-Co, Telecom-Co and Eleva-Co suggested that the IJVs\nthemselves did not always have the expertise to deal with sophisticated new products\n15\nand this slowed both the selection process and the elimination of problems in local\nmanufacturing.\nSourcing Strategy\nAll five IJVs avoided single-sourcing for local purchases because it was considered\ntoo risky (since a single-supplier might fail to deliver the required quality at the\nrequired time) and unlikely to reduce costs (through reduced competition).\nTalking about quality issues, a manager at Telecom-Co said, \u201cthe basic\nprinciple is that I have two or three suppliers for a purchase, so I can prevent risks and\npromote performance\u201d (Purchasing Manager). Telecom-Co\u2019s local supplier of\ncapacitors had passed selection criteria but following first shipments, \u201cits quality\ncontrol was not strict so that a serious quality incident occurred, so the order and the\ncertificate had to be cancelled immediately\u201d (Vendor Selection Manager).\nDiscussing costs the Purchasing Manager at Eleva-Co said, \u201cwe have to have a\nsecond supplier to back-up our purchasing ... [also] it is easier to negotiate the prices\nif we have multiple sources\u2026 it has proven to be a very hard task to cut the price with\nsingle-source suppliers.\u201d Having more than three suppliers was considered by the\nsample IJVs to be counterproductive. Consequently Switch-Co, Telecom-Co and\nEleva-Co use dual-sourcing with orders shared equally between two suppliers,\nwhereas Color-Dis-Co used a back-up sourcing strategy, with the main suppliers\nproviding 80% to 90% and a second supplier the remainder. TV-tube-Co typically\nbuys from two or three local suppliers.\nIn addition to local purchasing, all five IJVs maintained an active international\nsupplier base. The international suppliers used by IJVs were, as might be expected,\nlargely based on their foreign partners\u2019 supply chains and were used particularly for\n16\nhigh-tech components. Interviewees gave three main reasons for this. Firstly, almost\nall products manufactured in the IJVs were adopted from their foreign partners (albeit\nwith some localization). Therefore, the IJV is potentially dependent on the\ninternational supplier base during the early stages of production (before there is an\nopportunity to qualify local suppliers). Secondly, by being in contact with overseas\nsuppliers, IJVs have an opportunity to learn from these companies\u2019 practices.\n(Explaining this, a manager at Telecom-Co said that for the transfer of production and\nmanagement skills \u201cwe need to open a window to the world\u201d.) Thirdly, IJV partners\ncan enable international purchases to be made at lower cost. For example, Switch-Co\nhad the advantage of purchasing at a volume discount rate calculated for the total\ndemand across all the IJV partner\u2019s subsidiaries.\nDeveloping Relationships with Suppliers\nIn the literature the value of long-term relationships with suppliers\u2014including\nso-called partnerships\u2014has been strongly advocated. Across the IJV sample,\nhowever, relationships with local suppliers were mainly short-term and contracts were\nfor no longer than one year. Orders were, in most cases, placed on either a weekly or\nmonthly basis and relationships could be terminated at any time because of\nincomplete deliveries, or if a more competitive offer (in terms of price or services)\nwas received from another supplier. None of the sample IJVs trusted their local\nsuppliers enough to have given full responsibility for quality. Therefore, strict\nincoming inspections of materials and components were the norm.\nAll case companies monitored their suppliers on various criteria including\nquality, delivery, service and price. The main reason for this was to maintain\nstandards. Additional criteria included the supplier\u2019s financial and technical\n17\nperformance and how crucial the materials or components are. For example,\nSwitch-Co linked supplier performance with purchasing volumes and, accordingly,\ngrouped them into three major categories: \u201cpreferred\u201d (good performance, large\nvolume); \u201ccritical\u201d (poor performance, large volume); and \u201cstrategic\u201d (good\nperformance, small volume). TV-Tube-Co considered \u201cpartnerships\u201d as having been\nestablished with suppliers that not only have good delivery performance but also\nco-operate on price reduction and give good technological support. More information\nwas shared with these suppliers, including price trends and product design data.\nColor-Dis-Co frequently revised its list of critical materials, for which the\nrelationships with suppliers are more important. These relationships were closer and\nbased on longer-term agreements. For non-critical materials or components,\nopportunistic purchasing and tendering were used.\nPurchasing managers face a dichotomy in their relationships with suppliers.\nAll of the IJVs wanted to work long-term with their suppliers because they recognized\nthat selecting suppliers is time-consuming. In addition, they saw that long-term\nsuppliers could contribute to product innovation (some international suppliers do\nco-operate on product design). However, because local suppliers were often unreliable\nin terms of delivery and quality, IJVs favored short-term contracts. Furthermore, this\nalso helped IJVs to take advantages of downward trends in local markets, in order to\nexert pressure on suppliers to reduce their prices.\nContextual Issues\nAcross the sample IJVs, two major contextual issues were identified from the cross-\ncase analysis: problems with local suppliers and the \u201ctransition\u201d from international to\nlocal procurement.\n18\nProblems with local suppliers. This was a major issue for all the sample IJVs.\nAlthough purchasing in China has potential advantages, all of the case companies had\nexperienced significant problems with the quality; delivery performance and\ninsufficient technological expertise of their suppliers.\nAs mentioned earlier, due to the quality problems with local suppliers, all five\ncase companies conduct strict incoming tests. Switch-Co terminated their business\nwith 10% of their local suppliers because of quality issues. Similarly, at Eleva-Co\nonly 70% of capacitors pass incoming tests and some quality problems were only\ndiscovered after products had been installed. Consequently parts, which had\npreviously been purchased in China, had to be imported again. Since Eleva-Co has\nbeen manufacturing in China for 15 years, this demonstrates how difficult it is to\nestablish a reliable local supply chain. TV-Tube-Co faced similar issues and said,\n\u201cthere is always an uphill battle with local suppliers [to get them to deliver with a\nconsistent quality]\u201d (Materials Manager).\nThe inability of local suppliers to consistently meet delivery deadlines was a\nmajor concern for all IJVs. Local suppliers\u2019 production was susceptible to serious\ndisruptions\u2014water and electricity shortages, machine failure and poor management\nwere common causes identified by the interviewees. Another problem was the\npropensity of local suppliers to commit to more than they can deliver. Consequently,\nit is common practice for Chinese suppliers to rank their customers in terms of\ndelivery priority and so the purchasing managers at IJVs often attempted to identify\ntheir own organization\u2019s position in these \u201cpriority lists\u201d (Switch-Co, TV-Tube-Co\nand Color-Dis-Co).\nManagers acknowledged that most local suppliers do not have strong\ntechnological capabilities. This inhibits local purchasing of many of the parts used in\n19\nnew products. As the Purchasing Manager at Switch-Co explained, every time new\nproducts were introduced, the percentage of local materials dropped dramatically.\nConsequently, the case companies are cautious in approving new suppliers and take a\nconsiderable time over this, as noted earlier.\nTransition to local procurement. During the fieldwork a key issue emerged\u2014all five\ncase companies have tried for a number of years to increase the percentage purchased\nfrom local suppliers. As shown in Table I, for example, Telecom-Co initially\npurchased only 5% in China but is now purchasing 50% locally. Eleva-Co has gone\nfurther, having increased local purchasing to 92% by value today. Locally purchased\nmaterials and components offer potential cost savings but what is surprising is the\nlength of time taken to achieve significant levels of local supply.\nFigure 1 shows in detail how the local content in individual products has\nchanged over time. As might be expected, local-purchasing increases faster for\nrecently introduced products (indicated as Prodt 2) than with products introduced\nearlier (indicated as Prodt 1). For example, Color-Dis-Co, took five years to raise the\npercentage of local purchasing of early products from 20% to 85%, whereas only two\nyears were needed to achieve similar levels for more recently-introduced products\n(due to the existing contacts with Chinese suppliers). All of the interviewees agreed\nthat new products initially required the greater use of foreign suppliers, until the local\nones could provide the capabilities required. For example, the approval of existing\nsuppliers to produce parts for new products took about ten months to complete at\nSwitch-Co.\n(take in Figure 1)\n20\nFigure 1 also shows that the percentage of local purchasing increases to a\ncertain level and then remains constant at a \u201cplateau value\u201d. In Eleva-Co, for example,\nthe local content of the product (indicated as Eleva-Co Prodt 1) reached 92% for more\nthan six years, before the product was discontinued late in 1998. Interviewees at each\nof the IJVs thought that the local content could theoretically be higher. In\nTelecom-Co, for instance, the potential local purchasing was around 70% for Prodt 1\nwhile the actual local purchasing was currently 50%. Managers at the case companies\nagreed that the full local-sourcing was difficult and not worth the effort due to the\nproblems encountered\u2014\u201cit is impossible and unnecessary to purchase 100% from the\ndomestic market\u201d (Assistant Purchasing Manager, Color-Dis-Co). Typical materials,\nwhich were seen as better purchased overseas, were high-tech components that are\ncrucial to the quality and reliability of products. International purchasing was also\nperceived as contributing to an image of high quality (Switch-Co) and opening a\nwindow to advanced technology (Telecom-Co).\nFrom Figure 1, two key differences can also be identified. Firstly, there is a\nbig gap between two groups: TV-Tube-Co, Color-Dis-Co and Eleva-Co, and\nSwitch-Co and Telecom-Co in terms of percentage of local purchasing. The former\npurchase over 85%, while the latter purchase below 50%. A possible reason for this\ndifference is that the latter operate in the Chinese telecom industry, which is at an\nearly stage of development. Local suppliers are not advanced in terms of technology\nand operations management so \u201cthe increase in local content depends on the\ndevelopment of the whole high-tech industry [in China]\u201d (Purchasing Manager,\nSwitch-Co). Secondly, the local content of the earlier products is higher than that of\nthe recently introduced products but the latter increased faster than the former.\n21\nIn summarizing the research findings on the transition from international to\nlocal purchasing, Figure 2 gives a conceptual representation of the shift to local\nsuppliers. The IJVs start local purchasing at relatively a low level (5%-35%). It takes\n4-10 years to reach a higher level (35%-92%). Then a plateau is reached, the level of\nwhich is largely determined by the availability of technological expertise at local\nsuppliers. Then the local content of products remains constant, although theoretically\nit could be further increased. Local content can also be increased faster for later\nproducts (compared to the earliest products manufactured at the IJV).\n(take in Figure 2)\nDISCUSSION OF THE RESEARCH FINDINGS\nAs the first detailed study of supplier management in Chinese IJVs, the research\nidentified the challenges of trying to shift to a higher percentage of local procurement.\nIJVs need to manage this transition effectively and so it is important to identify the\nfactors that have most influence over local purchasing.\nNormally IJVs start with a low percentage of locally purchased materials and\ncomponents, and it can take years to increase this percentage significantly. This\nclearly indicates that the performance of suppliers in China is much lower than their\ninternational counterparts in areas such as technological capability and process\ncontrol. IJVs know the limitations of local suppliers but are keen to try to achieve the\npotential cost savings of local procurement. Many factors can influence the transition\nto local purchasing. Table II summarizes the main factors identified from the literature\nreview and the fieldwork. Some factors tend to accelerate the transition to a higher\npercentage of local purchasing, whilst others inhibit it. For example, the lower cost of\nlocally purchased materials and components is a key motivating factor for IJVs to\n22\nsource in China. Local purchasing is potentially cheaper (by 25 to 75%) and faster\n(1\/3rd to 1\/10th of comparable international delivery time). All of the case IJVs are\ncurrently adopting just-in-time production, with the need for weekly or daily delivery.\nTherefore, proximity of suppliers will be a key factor.\n(take in Table II)\nAll the IJV managers interviewed said that they thought it was important to\nbuy a significant amount of Chinese materials. This view might reflect partly the\npressure from authorities. Previously, the local government asked IJVs to meet strict\ngoals for reaching \u201clocal content\u201d percentages and nominated local suppliers.\nNowadays, the intervention of government has diminished but is still a factor, which\nenhances the transition to local purchasing. Two other factors, which enhance the\ntransition to local procurement, are local knowledge of purchasing managers (e.g.\nChinese language and culture, etc.) and the simplicity of transaction with local\nsuppliers. Therefore IJVs \u201cneed us Chinese managers in understanding the Chinese\nlegal frameworks and in communicating [effectively] with governmental officials and\nlocal suppliers\u201d (Color-Dis-Co).\nThe results do not confirm the conclusions of previous research on two factors.\nFirstly, the strong influence of Guanxi was not identified. None of the interviewees\nidentified it, although they may have deliberately omitted to mention it. Secondly,\nIJVs used to have to balance their foreign exchange. The current research shows that\nthe IJVs do not face this issue anymore\u2014they can now freely buy and sell foreign\nexchange in the local market set up in China.\nThe research provided consistent evidence across the sample of the inhibitors\nto a fast transition to local purchasing. First and foremost is the poor performance of\n23\nmany Chinese suppliers - variable quality, poor delivery reliability and insufficient\ntechnological expertise - severely inhibits IJVs from purchasing more locally.\nLimitations of the Research\nThe limitations of the research need to be acknowledged, so those researchers active\nin this field can address them in the future. The main limitation derives from the small\nexploratory sample, which covered a range of industries and national origins of the\nforeign partners but is unlikely to be representative of IJV manufacturing in China.\nThis, of course, limits the external validity of the research. In addition, the five\ncompanies were all formed more than ten years ago and it may have introduced a\ndegree of bias in the results because large survivors were studied. However, the\nsample was deliberately selected to give a \u201chistorical\u201d perspective on supplier\nmanagement in China.\nAnother limitation results from the methodology. At each case company only\ntwo to three managers were interviewed and the findings are largely based on\n\u201cmanager reported\u201d issues (although these were triangulated where possible against\ndocumentation). Achieving the co-operation of IJVs and access to more interviewees\n(particularly expatriates) is difficult (Zhang and Goffin, 1999) and so, in the context\nof exploratory research, this limitation had to be accepted.\nFuture Research\nRecognizing the contributions and limitations of the current study, five main areas for\nfurther research can be identified.\n\uf0b7 A wider survey is required to determine whether the issues faced by the five IJVs\nare typical and investigate the differences across various industrial sectors.\n24\n\uf0b7 A useful comparison would be a follow-up study of five more recently formed\nIJVs, to see if their supplier management practices were significantly different.\n\uf0b7 Further studies need to investigate supplier management in more depth\u2014through,\nfor example, making longitudinal studies of the development of suppliers and\ninvestigating Chinese suppliers\u2019 perspectives\u2019 on their relationships with IJVs.\n\uf0b7 In many other countries there is a strong move towards involving suppliers in\nNPD. Under what circumstances this is possible in China needs investigation.\n\uf0b7 Finally, future research needs to explore other national contexts. The literature\nreview showed that the majority of studies of supplier management have been\nconducted in the US. Studies from other national contexts will increase the\nunderstanding of supplier management. It would be particularly interesting to\nknow whether the transition to local purchasing is a major challenge for IJVs in\nother developing economies.\nBased on the insight gained from the current research, three research propositions can\nbe generated that require further investigation:\nProposition 1: It takes several years IJVs several years to transition to a higher\npercentage of locally-purchased parts and, each time a new product is introduced, the\nlocal content will drop temporarily.\nProposition 2: Many factors influence the move to local purchasing. From these, the\nmain accelerators of the transition are the lower prices and potentially faster delivery,\nwhereas the main inhibitors are the variable quality, poor delivery performance and\nlack of technological expertise of local suppliers.\nProposition 3: The highest percentage of local purchasing achievable depends on the\nmaturity of that industry in China\u2014i.e. the extent to which a reliable supplier base\nexists. (For some products it will be around 80%, for others much lower.)\n25\nSUMMARY\nThe research showed the difficulties faced by IJVs in China in trying to reduce costs\nthrough purchasing a significant percentage of their materials and components locally.\nThe results have two main implications for practitioners. Firstly, any new IJV in\nChina will take a number of years to achieve high levels of local purchasing and the\npotential cost savings that this can bring. Therefore, one of the perceived major\nadvantages of manufacturing in China\u2014lower bought-in costs\u2014takes much longer to\nachieve than probably most companies new to China believe. For manufacturers\ndependent on technology such as telecommunication devices, there may be no\nexisting supply chain in China and this will take even longer to develop. During the\ntime that a local supply chain is being developed, IJVs need to plan for international\nsourcing of the majority of their parts and components. A surprising result of the\nresearch was the level of incoming quality and delivery problems that IJVs suffer,\neven after years of operating with their Chinese suppliers. This means that caution is\nnecessary in trying to increase the locally purchased percentage. It also means that\ncostly inbound quality tests are needed.\nThe second main issue for managers at IJVs is that they need to take a\nproactive approach to developing both technological and management expertise in\ntheir local suppliers. Technological expertise is essential for supporting new products,\nand better managerial skills are needed at suppliers, if quality and delivery problems\nare to be eliminated. With increasing international evidence that manufacturers can\nuse their suppliers to enhance their own competitiveness, it will be interesting to see if\nIJVs in China are able to achieve this with their local suppliers. It will be a challenge\nbut, as one respondent said, \u201cthe survival and prosperity of the company [IJV]\ndepends to a large degree on effective supplier management\u201d.\n26\nREFERENCES\nReaders should note that confusion could arise from referencing Chinese publications.\nThis is because the Chinese normally write their family name first, followed by their\ngiven name. Therefore, some Western researchers make mistakes in shortening\nreferences to surnames and initials. Further confusion arises when Chinese researchers\n\u201cWesternize\u201d the order of their names (i.e. with the family name second). In the\nfollowing list of references, Chinese surnames are given with initials and, for\nexample, the first author\u2019s name is Zhang Lihong and this is correctly shortened to\nZhang, L. To avoid any confusion, the authors of this paper have underlined their\nfamily names and encourage the adoption of this practice in international journals.\n1. Asmus, D. and Griffin, J.
