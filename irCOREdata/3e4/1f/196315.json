These lakes had different salt compositions and pH values, and were at 29 \nvariable geographic distances, both at local and inter-continental scales, which 30 \nallowed us to explore the microbial community composition within the context of 31 \nboth contemporary environmental conditions and geographic distance. Fourteen 16S 32 \nrRNA gene clone libraries were constructed, and over 200 16S rRNA gene sequences 33 \nwere obtained. These sequences were used to construct biotic similarity matrices, 34 \nwhich were used in combination with environmental similarity matrices and a 35 \ndistance matrix in the Mantel test to discover which factors significantly influenced 36 \nbiotic similarity. We showed that archaeal biogeography was influenced by 37 \ncontemporary environmental factors alone (Na\n+\n, CO3\n2-\n, and HCO3\n-\n ion concentrations, 38 \npH and temperature). Bacterial biogeography was influenced both by contemporary 39 \nenvironmental factors (Na\n+\n, Mg\n2+ \nand HCO3\n-\n ion concentrations and pH) and by 40 \ngeographic distance. 41 \n42 \n 3 \nIntroduction 43 \nBiogeography aims to explain spatial patterns of diversity in the context of 44 \nevolutionary events such as speciation, dispersal, extinction and species interactions 45 \n[42]. Macro-ecologists have long studied the biogeography of higher plants and 46 \nanimals in various habitats [9, 13]. In contrast, there is very little information 47 \navailable on the biogeography of prokaryotes. This stemmed from the difficulty of 48 \nassessing microbial communities by cultivation methods, which only sampled 0.1 \u2013 49 \n10% of the microbial community [30]. However, with the advent of cultivation 50 \nindependent sequencing techniques, microbial communities of many environments 51 \nhave been characterised, including soil [43], the Arctic and Antarctic Oceans [5] and 52 \nthe Sargasso sea [61]. This in turn facilitated prokaryotic biogeography studies in a 53 \nnumber of environments on scales ranging from 20 000 km to 0.002 km [42]. 54 \n 55 \nA study on the biogeography of soil bacteria across the Americas showed that 56 \ndifferences were largely attributed to soil pH, with higher diversity observed in 57 \nneutral soils [20]. Bacterial communities in an estuary in Massachusetts were found to 58 \nvary with the salinity gradient [14]. Such studies demonstrated that environmental 59 \nparameters influenced biogeographical patterns in microbial diversity. Further studies 60 \ndemonstrated that biogeography of hot spring cyanobacteria, hyperthermophilic 61 \narchaea and Pseudomonas stains was influenced by geographic distance, which led to 62 \nisolation of disparate populations and subsequent genetic divergence [12, 51, 63]. The 63 \napparent allopatric speciation demonstrated in these studies therefore contested the 64 \nidea that prokaryotes were not affected by limits to dispersal due to their small size, 65 \nabundance and metabolic plasticity (\u2017everything is everywhere\u2018, see below) [21]. 66 \n 67 \n 4 \nA simple framework was suggested to distinguish between the effects of evolutionary 68 \nevents and contemporary environmental conditions on the spatial variation of 69 \nmicrobial diversity [42]. At the centre of this framework were four hypotheses. The 70 \nnull hypothesis stated that microorganisms were distributed randomly over space. 71 \nUpon rejection of the null hypothesis, the second hypothesis stated that spatial 72 \nvariation reflected the influence of contemporary environmental variation. It assumed 73 \nthat geographic distance did not affect diversity due to the wide dispersal of 74 \nmicroorganisms. This hypothesis is the famously quoted \u2017everything is everywhere; 75 \nthe milieu selects\u2018 by Baas-Becking [4, 6]. The third hypothesis stated that variation 76 \nwas shaped by evolutionary events [geographic distance] that limited dispersal, and 77 \npast environmental conditions led to genetic divergence between different microbial 78 \nassemblages. The fourth hypothesis stated that the biogeography of microorganisms 79 \nwas determined by both contemporary environmental conditions and past 80 \nevolutionary events [geographic distance]. It is important to note here the possibility 81 \nthat evolutionary events can be represented by geographic distances. (For more details 82 \non this framework, see [42]).  83 \n 84 \nMany studies have been carried out on salt lakes and salterns around the world [28], 85 \nbut few have tried to explain variations in microbial community composition. Those 86 \nthat did identified salinity, altitude, redox and ionic concentration, pO2 and seasonal 87 \nevents as relevant factors [7, 11, 16, 17, 34, 35, 38, 65]. To our knowledge, only two 88 \nstudies have looked at the effect of inter-continental geographic distances on 89 \nmicrobial community composition in salt lakes. Foti and colleagues looked 90 \nspecifically at the biogeography of Thioalkalivibrio in soda lakes across Mongolia, 91 \nKenya, California, Egypt and Siberia, and found that these bacteria showed a 92 \n 5 \ntendency for endemism, hence geographic distance was a significant factor in 93 \ninfluencing community composition [22]. A further study looked at the biogeography 94 \nof Salinibacter ruber strains from salterns in the Mediterranean, Atlantic and Peruvian 95 \nregions using a metabolomic approach. Geographically distinct strains were 96 \ndistinguished by characteristic metabolites [58]. 97 \n 98 \nWe examined the prokaryotic community composition in several salt lakes using 99 \nribosomal DNA methods. Six of the salt lakes in this study were situated on the Inner 100 \nMongolian steppe, north-west of Beijing, which had an average elevation of 1000-101 \n2000 m above sea level. The lakes were mostly several hundred km apart (0.147-102 \n395.2) and are in different climate and vegetation zones \u2013 typical grassland steppe in 103 \nthe north and east, to desert steppe bordering the Gobi desert in the south and west 104 \n[70]. The lakes were Bagaejinnor, Chagannor, Ejinnor, Erliannor, Shangmatala and an 105 \nunnamed lake near Xilinhot. Lakes Ejinnor and Erliannor were extensively developed 106 \ninto salterns. The salar Guayatayoc Lake was situated in the same basin as the Salinas 107 \nGrandes in the Argentine Altiplano at an elevation of 3432 m, north-west of the city 108 \nSalta, approximately 18000 km from the other lakes. All salt lakes were 109 \nathalassohaline, located in arid climates, and subjected to high solar radiation and 110 \nwide ranges of temperature. The lakes had different salt compositions and allowed us 111 \nto explore the microbial community composition within the context of both 112 \ncontemporary environmental conditions and geographic distance. 113 \n 114 \nHere we describe the microbial diversity of six salt lakes in Inner Mongolia and one 115 \nsalt lake in Argentina. Using the framework previously described, we present 116 \nevidence that biogeography of Archaea in these salt lakes was significantly influenced 117 \n 6 \n(P <0.05) by environmental factors (Na\n+\n, CO3\n2-\n, and HCO3\n-\n ion concentrations, pH 118 \nand temperature), but not geographic distance, consistent with the previously stated 119 \nhypothesis 2. We also show that the biogeography of Bacteria was significantly 120 \ninfluenced (P <0.05) by both environmental factors (Na\n+\n, Mg\n2+\n and HCO3- ion 121 \nconcentrations and pH) and geographic distance, consistent with the previously stated 122 \nhypothesis 4. 123 \n124 \n 7 \nMaterials and Methods 125 \nDescriptions of Sampling Sites 126 \nAll sites were remote from centres of population and usually involved long drives 127 \nover unmade roads. Our ability to transport equipment was limited. Lakes themselves 128 \nwere often fringed by deep mud making sampling hazardous. The first four lakes were 129 \nin areas of grassland steppe, the last two lakes in desert steppe and the Argentine lake 130 \nin an arid high altitude plateau. Temperature, pH and chemical analyses of the brines 131 \nare shown in Table 1. 132 \n 133 \nLake Bagaejinnor (BJ) was a hypersaline lake, whose coordinates were N45\no\n 134 \n 08.527\u2018 E116o 36.167\u2018, north of the town Qog Ul. It has a surface area of 5 km2 135 \nduring the wet season [66]. It had evaporated over the summer, exposing salt 136 \nencrusted mud flats and had been reduced to a number of small pools and lagoons. 137 \nThe brine was colourless, but the salt crystals had a pink colouration, indicating the 138 \npresence of haloarchaea. 139 \n 140 \nLake Ejinnor (EJ) was a hypersaline lake, with coordinates of N45\n o\n 14.452\u2018 E116 o 141 \n32. 477\u2018 north of the town of Qog Ul, 40 km from lake BJ. It is a large shallow lake, 142 \n0.05-0.3M deep, with evaporating lagoons on the eastern side of the main body of 143 \nwater. The lake water sample was taken from a large saltern containing red brine and 144 \norange-pigmented salt crystals about 0.3 m deep. 145 \n 146 \nAn unnamed lake, located north-west of Xilin Hot with coordinates of N47\n o\n 55.355\u2018 147 \nE115\no\n 36.757\u2018 was also sampled. It was a hypersaline lake situated near an abandoned 148 \nsoda works. The lake was divided by several causeways. A shallow lagoon was found 149 \n 8 \ncut off from the rest of the lake, which was where one of the sampling sites was 150 \nlocated (XH). The lake had a thick white salt crust, while the brine was clear and 151 \ncolourless and contained brine shrimps (Artemia sp.). Leading from the lake was a 152 \ndrainage channel that connected to a 15 cm deep pool of green brine (147 m from the 153 \nlake), where a second sample was taken (X). 154 \n 155 \nLake Shangmatala a hypersaline lake was located in a shallow basin surrounded by 156 \nhills at an elevation of 987 m with coordinates N43\u00b0 22.751'  E114\u00b0 01. 361'. The lake 157 \nhad a surface area of 2.5 km\n2 \nand a depth of 0.1-0.15 m. The lake was surrounded by 158 \nlush grassland and vegetation, which grew almost up to the water\u2018s edge. The soil 159 \nnearest the lake appeared to be soda soil, which had a layer of lichen growing on the 160 \nsurface. It was noted that an unpleasant smelling gas was emitted. A causeway led 161 \ndirectly into the lake. 162 \n 163 \nLake Chagannor (CG) was a large hypersaline soda lake, situated near a soda works, 164 \n120 km south of Mandulatu, with coordinates of N43\no\n 16.131\u2018 E112o 55.636\u2018. 165 \nSampling took place on the south side of the lake. The brine appeared green and the 166 \nmud was grey and viscous, with a layer of fine salt. 167 \n 168 \n 169 \nLake Erliannor (EN) was a hypersaline lake, located north of Erenhot on the 170 \nMongolian border and the trans-Siberian railway, with coordinates of N43\no\n 44.426\u2018 171 \nE112\n o\n 02. 081\u2018. It is reported to have a surface area of 8.75 km2 and a depth of  0.1-172 \n0.3 m. The natural lake was unrecognisable due to extensive development of salterns. 173 \n 9 \nThe lake water sample was taken from a saltern (0.1 m depth) that contained 174 \ncolourless brine and a white salt crust. 175 \n 176 \nSalar Guayatayoc Lake (AG) was a hypersaline lake on the north edge of the Salinas 177 \nGrandes, Argentina. Its coordinates were S23\n o\n 36.604\u2018 W o 65 51.998\u2018. It was locally 178 \nreported to have a depth of 30 m and was covered by a ~ 1 m thick salt crust. Samples 179 \nwere taken through a hole in this crust.  180 \n 181 \nSample Collection 182 \nBiomass from the water column from the Argentinean salt lake was sampled in July 183 \n2003 and from the Inner Mongolian salt lakes in September 2003. In Inner Mongolia, 184 \nbrine was sampled at a distance in 250 ml stainless steel beakers suspended on the end 185 \nof a 1 m pole. In Argentina, brine was collected through a hole in the ~ 1 m thick salt 186 \ncrust. Water was filtered through sterile 0.45 \u00b5m membrane filters (Millipore) in a 187 \n250 ml capacity polycarbonate filter unit (Sartorius) using a Nalgene hand pump, 188 \nwhich produced a vacuum of 40-50 cm Hg under field conditions. Water was 189 \nprocessed in this way until flow stopped, which suggested that sufficient biomass was 190 \ncaptured on the filter. Membrane filters were removed from the apparatus using sterile 191 \ntweezers and placed immediately in cold sterile stabilisation buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 192 \npH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 2 M NaCl) and agitated to resuspend the cells. This was 193 \nimmediately placed on ice until further processing. 194 \n 195 \nMeasuring Geographic Distances 196 \n 10 \nGPS coordinates recorded at each sampling point were imported into MapSource\u2122 197 \naccording to the manufacturer\u2018s instructions to measure the geographic distances 198 \nbetween the sites. 199 \n 200 \nMeasuring pH, Temperature and Salinity of the Salt Lakes 201 \nThe pH of the salt lake water was measured using pH strips (Merck). 202 \n 203 \nThe temperature was measured using a Solomat 520C temperature monitor or a 204 \nHanna KType thermocouple with SP weighted tanker probe (Jencons, Leighton 205 \nBuzzard, UK) according to manufacturer\u2018s instructions. The temperature was 206 \nmeasured at a distance by attaching the probe to the end of a 1 m pole. Other physical 207 \nand chemical analysis were performed on samples filtered through a 0.22 micron 208 \nmembrane, stored in sterile screw capped vials. 209 \n 210 \nThe salinity was measured using a Hanna HI 8633 or HI9033 multirange conductivity 211 \nmeter (Jencons, Leighton Buzzard, UK), which was calibrated to 20\u00b0C with a 212 \ntemperature coefficient of 2% according to the manufacturer\u2018s instructions. All salt 213 \nlake water readings were off the scale, hence they were serially diluted with distilled 214 \nwater and readings made at the 199.9 mS\/cm range. Water conductivity gave an 215 \nindication of total salt concentration in g\/L [64]. 216 \n 217 \nDetermining Chemical Composition of Salt Lake Water 218 \nChemical analysis of the salt lake water was carried out by Inductively Coupled 219 \nPlasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-ES). Samples were sent for analysis to 220 \nthe Geology Department at the University of Leicester. 221 \n 11 \n 222 \nTitrations of Carbonate and Bicarbonate 223 \nConcentrations of carbonate ions (CO3\n2-\n) and bicarbonate ions (HCO3-) were found by 224 \ntitration of lake water with H2SO4 using a Digital Titrator Model 16900 (Hach 225 \nSystems for Analysis) according to manufacturer\u2018s instructions. 226 \n 227 \nCommunity DNA extraction and PCR Amplification of 16S rRNA genes 228 \nCommunity DNA from the Inner Mongolian samples was extracted from 229 \nenvironmental samples using the GenomicPrep Cells and Tissue DNA Isolation Kit 230 \n(Amersham Biosciences). The initial stages of protein precipitation were carried out 231 \non site and the sample stored at -20\u00b0C until DNA purification could be carried out in 232 \nthe laboratory in Leicester. Community DNA from the Argentinean sample was 233 \nextracted by freezing the filter in a small amount of liquid nitrogen, which was then 234 \nhomogenised in a pre-cooled pestle and mortar (at -80\u00b0C). This material was 235 \ntransferred to a clean tube, and 960 \u03bcl of NET buffer (150 mM NaCl, 100 mM EDTA 236 \npH 8.0, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) containing 15 mg\/ml of lysozyme was added, which 237 \nwas incubated at 37\u00b0C for 10 min. 192 \u03bcl of 11mg\/ml proteinase K and 128 \u03bcl of 10% 238 \n(w\/v) SDS were added and incubated for a further 30 min at 65\u00b0C. DNA was 239 \nextracted by phenol chloroform and ethanol precipitation. The DNA pellet was 240 \nresuspended in 150 \u03bcl of Tris-EDTA. Archaeal and bacterial 16S rRNA genes were 241 \nPCR amplified as previously described [25]. 242 \n 243 \nConstruction of 16S rRNA Gene Libraries and Screening Inserts 244 \nPCR products were ligated into pGEM T-easy cloning vector and transfected into 245 \nJM109 E. coli cells according to manufacturer\u2018s instructions to make 16S rRNA gene 246 \n 12 \nlibraries. Forty-eight white colonies containing recombinant plasmids were picked 247 \nfrom each library and grown in Luria Bertani broth (1% (w\/v) tryptone, 0.5% (w\/v) 248 \nyeast extract, 0.5% (w\/v) NaCl and adjusted to pH 7.0 with 1 M NaOH) containing 249 \n100 \u03bcg\/ml of ampicillin at 37\u00b0C overnight. Inserts were amplified by colony PCR by 250 \nthe following method: 2-3 \u03bcl cell culture was mixed with 20 \u03bcl 0.25% (v\/v) Tween 20 251 \nand boiled for 20 min to denature cellular proteins. Cell debris was pelleted by 252 \ncentrifugation at 10000 x g for 10 min. 15 \u03bcl of this cell lysate was used in a second 253 \nround of PCR using flanking vector primers M13F 5\u2018-GTT TTC CCA GTC ACG 254 \nAC-3\u2018 and M13R 5\u2018-CAG GAA ACA GCT ATG AC-3\u2018 in a reaction previously 255 \ndescribed (see above), to a final volume of 25 \u03bcl. This gave an expected amplicon of 256 \n1.7 kb.  257 \n 258 \nTo look for the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) pattern of each 259 \ninsert, the 1.7 kb PCR products were digested with HaeIII (NEB) in the 260 \nmanufacturer\u2018s reaction buffer at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. Fragments were visualised by 261 \nelectrophoresis in TAE using 2% agarose. Identical RFLPs were then identified by 262 \neye, and unique sequences were sent for sequencing to Lark Technologies Ltd 263 \n(Essex). 264 \n 265 \nComputer Analysis 266 \nThe CHIMERA_CHECK program available from the Ribosomal Database Project 267 \n(RDP) (http:\/\/rdp8.cme.msu.edu\/cgis\/news.cgi.) and Pintail [3] were used to check for 268 \nchimeric sequences. Rarefaction curves were calculated from RFLP data using 269 \nAnalytical Rarefaction version 1.3 available at UGA Stratigraphy Lab 270 \n(http:\/\/www.uga.edu\/~strata\/software\/anRareReadme.html). 16S rRNA sequences 271 \n 13 \nwere searched using Blastn [1]. Sequences were aligned using MEGA version 3.1 272 \n[39]. The values for the Jaccard Index were determined using EstimateS (version 7.5; 273 \nDepartment of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Connecticut 274 \n[http:\/\/viceroy.eeb.uconn.edu\/estimates]). The simple and partial Mantel Tests were 275 \ncarried out using the zt programme [8].  276 \n 277 \nDefinition of Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) 278 \nThe 16S rRNA gene sequences were aligned using MEGA version 3.1 [39], and the 279 \noutput file was used to define Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) using DOTUR 280 \n[59]. This was done using the furthest neighbour clustering algorithm (default setting). 281 \nIn this study, three of the commonly used OTU definitions were used (95%, 97% and 282 \n99%), which is equivalent to comparing taxonomic resolutions: at the genus, species 283 \nand sub-species level [31]. From 217 non-chimeric sequences, 184 unique sequences 284 \nwere detected at an OTU definition of 99%, 135 unique sequences at 97% and 110 285 \nunique sequences at 95%. 286 \n 287 \nConstruction of Phylogenetic Trees 288 \nPhylogenetic analysis was done using MEGA version 3.1 [39] using the Jukes and 289 \nCantor nucleotide substitution model for sequence alignment and the Neighbour-290 \nJoining method of tree inference. The support for each node was determined by 291 \nassembling a consensus tree of 1000 bootstrap replicates using the same phylogenetic 292 \nsettings. 16S rRNA gene sequences retrieved from the clone libraries were deposited 293 \ninto EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database, with accession numbers FM210811 - 294 \nFM211027. 295 \n 296 \n 14 \nStandard Normal Deviate Equivalents (SNDE) 297 \nRaw environmental data were standardised to make the different environmental 298 \nfactors comparable. This was done by the following equation: SNDE = (x \u2013 mean of 299 \nthe raw data) \/ standard deviation of the raw data, where x is the raw data for one 300 \nsampling site. 301 \n 302 \nCoverage 303 \nLibrary coverage was calculated using the following equation: C = (1- (n1 \/ N)) 100 304 \nwhere n1 is the number of RFLPs represented by a clone and N is the total number of 305 \nclones in the library [24]. 306 \n307 \n 15 \nResults 308 \n 309 \nScreening for Chimeras 310 \nThe sequencing dataset (219 16S rRNA gene sequences) were screened for suspected 311 \nchimeras using the CHIMERA_CHECK program available from the Ribosomal 312 \nDatabase Project (RDP). Subsequently, 56 suspected chimeric sequences were 313 \nanalysed by Pintail [3]. No chimeric sequences were detected in the archaeal 16S 314 \nrRNA gene libraries. However, 3 chimeric sequences were detected in the bacterial 315 \n16S rRNA gene libraries and were removed from further analysis. This observed 316 \nfrequency is less than previously reported [62]. However, since only partial sequences 317 \nwere used in the analysis, fewer chimeras were likely to be found. Chimeras are more 318 \nlikely to be detected in a dataset containing longer 16S rRNA gene sequences, i.e., if 319 \nboth ends of the 16S rRNA gene were sequenced.  320 \n 321 \nLibrary Coverage 322 \nRarefaction curves are used to identify when sampling is sufficient to determine 323 \nspecies diversity with some level of confidence. The numbers of unique clones were 324 \nplotted against the number of unique species. Fig 1 shows that library coverage was 325 \ngenerally approaching plateau stages, with coverage calculated between 44 \u2013 80%. 326 \nThe bacterial library from Lake Bagaejinnor was the clear exception, with coverage 327 \nestimated at just 8%. Coverage in the archaeal libraries was generally higher than in 328 \nthe bacterial libraries, reflecting lower diversity in the former. Bacterial diversity in 329 \nLake Ejinnor was strikingly lower than in the other lakes, although the reason for this 330 \nis unclear. 331 \n 332 \n 16 \nArchaeal Diversity 333 \nPhylogenetic analysis showed the assignment of clone sequences into seven 334 \nmonophyletic assemblages within the order Halobacteriales (Fig 2). Clone sequences 335 \nbranched within the Halorubrum, Natronomonas, Halogeometricum, Halobaculum, 336 \nHaloarcula, Halorhabdus and Halosimplex lineages. The range of haloarchaea 337 \nidentified in this study was entirely consistent with the saline conditions of the 338 \nenvironments sampled. There were additional, well supported lineages that formed 339 \nbetween these nodes, designated Clusters 1-4 (bootstrap values between 74 and 99), 340 \nwhich showed that these sequences were significantly different to any known species. 341 \nOther known genera within the order Halobacteriales were represented in the tree; 342 \nhowever none of the sequences in the Clusters affiliated closely with any of them. 343 \nCluster 1 contained sequences that were 99% identical to a clone found in crystalliser 344 \nponds in Australia [10]. Clusters 2, 3 and 4 all showed low sequence similarity 345 \n(<98%) to uncultured organisms (data not shown), so were therefore unique to the 346 \nsites sampled. Moreover, sequence \u2017EJ22\u2018 found in Lake Ejinnor did not affiliate with 347 \nany lineage, and was therefore unique to this saltern. 348 \n 349 \nTwenty-eight clone sequences branched with the Halorubrum lineage. Sequences 350 \nfrom both Inner Mongolia and Argentina were found in this group, which 351 \ndemonstrated its ubiquitous nature. Sequences from Lake Chagannor were most 352 \nsimilar to haloalkaliphilic Halorubrum vacuolatum, which was consistent with the 353 \nhighly alkaline pH of this lake (pH 10.5). Similarly, sequences from Lake Chagannor 354 \nand the small pool at the unnamed lake (pH 9.5) were affiliated with the 355 \nhaloalkaliphilic group Natronomonas. Twenty-five clone sequences branched with 356 \nCluster 1, a well supported lineage that is phylogenetically distinct from the 357 \n 17 \nHalorubrum branch (bootstrap value of 98). It was the second largest haloarchaeal 358 \ngroup in this study, and again was ubiquitous in the habitats studied. Cluster 4 359 \ncontains 16 clone sequences from both Inner Mongolia and Argentina. It formed a 360 \nlineage on the periphery of the Halobacteriales that does not show any resemblance to 361 \nknown Euryarchaeota, which suggested that adaptation to hypersaline environments 362 \nmay extend to Archaea outside the Halobacteriales. 363 \n 364 \nBacterial Diversity 365 \nPhylogenetic analysis showed the distribution of clone sequences into seven 366 \nmonophyletic assemblages \u2013 Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, 367 \nDeltaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chlorophyceae, Cyanobacteria, and Aquificales - 368 \nand two paraphyletic groups of the Firmicutes (Fig 3). In addition, there were well 369 \nsupported lineages that formed between these nodes, designated Clusters 1-4 370 \n(bootstrap values between 50 and 99). Cluster 3 contained a sequence that was 99% 371 \nidentical to a clone found in Lake Chaka, an athalassohaline lake in China [35]. 372 \nSequences in Clusters 1, 2 and 4 were unique to these sites as they all had low 373 \nsequence similarities to uncultured organisms (<98% identity).  374 \n 375 \nDNA from chloroplasts in Eukarya was clearly extracted in community DNA 376 \npreparations, which resulted in several chloroplast 16S rRNA genes in the clone 377 \nlibraries (Chlorophyceae). These were related to chloroplasts found in Dunaliella 378 \nsalina, a typical salt lake inhabitant [49]. 379 \n 380 \nThe Proteobacteria were the largest group, containing 38 clone sequences. This group 381 \nwas divided into the Gammaproteobacteria (28 sequences), Deltaproteobacteria (6 382 \n 18 \nsequences) and Alphaproteobacteria (4 sequences). Sequences from both Inner 383 \nMongolia and Argentina were only affiliated with the former two divisions, while 384 \nonly Inner Mongolian sequences were affiliated with the Alphaproteobacteria. Many 385 \nclone sequences were related to Halomonas, also typical inhabitants of salt lake 386 \nenvironments [27]. The second largest group was the Bacteroidetes, which consisted 387 \nof 31 clone sequences from both Inner Mongolia and Argentina. Clone sequences 388 \nfrom the saltern at Lake Ejinnor were affiliated with Salinibacter ruber, an extremely 389 \nhalophilic bacterium [2]. The third largest group was the Firmicutes, which consisted 390 \nof 27 clone sequences, all from Inner Mongolia. The majority of these clones were 391 \nrelated to anaerobic species related to the Halanaerobiaceae, with three clones related 392 \nto Bacillus sp. 393 \n 394 \nOther clone sequences from Inner Mongolia, BJ67, EN105 and SH116 were also 395 \naffiliated with or branched near to the deeply branching Aquificae, see Fig 3, which 396 \nusually inhabit hot spring environments [55]. This lineage appeared to be unique to 397 \nthe Inner Mongolian sites as no other Aquificales sequences have been found at other 398 \nsalt lakes. Owing to the low sequence similarity to existing 16S rRNA gene 399 \nsequences, it may not be appropriate to construe the growth temperature ranges of 400 \nthese bacteria. However recently, mesophilic members of a deeply branching group 401 \nhave been discovered [46], so perhaps these clone sequences represent novel lineages 402 \ndistantly related to Aquificae that are adapted to lower temperatures.  403 \n 404 \nCommunity Composition and Biotic Similarity Matrices 405 \nComparison of the overall archaeal community composition (Table 2) and bacterial 406 \ncommunity composition (Table 3) of the salt lakes demonstrates that they were 407 \n 19 \nunique. This was assessed using the Jaccard Index, calculated using the program 408 \nEstimateS for each definition of OTU. No pair of lakes scored a value of 1 (1 = 409 \nidentical biotic composition) as can be seen from the biotic similarity matrices. 410 \n 411 \nGeographic-Distance Matrix 412 \nThe matrix for the distances between each of the environments in this study is found 413 \nin the supplementary data, Table 1. This was calculated using the GPS coordinates 414 \nmeasured during the expedition (see Methods). 415 \n 416 \nEnvironmental Similarity Matrices 417 \nTo construct environmental similarity matrices, all raw values had to be standardised 418 \nto make them comparable since this accommodates different units of different 419 \nvariables. Therefore, Standard Normal Deviate Equivalents (SNDE) values were 420 \ncalculated for temperature, pH, and concentrations of Na\n+\n, Mg\n2+\n, K\n+\n, Cl\n-\n, S, CO3\n2-\n and 421 \nHCO3\n-\n ions (supplementary data, Tables 2-10). In order to construct a similarity 422 \nmatrix with this new standardised data, values of one minus the Euclidean distance 423 \nbetween the SNDE values of two lakes was calculated. A value of 1 therefore 424 \nindicated that a particular environmental factor was identical for the two lakes. The 425 \nenvironmental similarity matrices are found in the supplementary data. 426 \n 427 \nBiogeography of Archaea 428 \nThe simple Mantel test was carried out using the zt program [8]. This program 429 \ncalculated whether biotic similarity correlated with environmental factors, and 430 \nwhether this correlation was statistically significant. The value of r\n2\n was the 431 \ncorrelation value; positive or negative values reflected the type of relationship 432 \n 20 \nbetween the two matrices, while P was the probability associated with r\n2\n. Values of P 433 \nwere significant if they were less than 0.05; values greater than 0.05 indicated that the 434 \nnull hypothesis applied. (The null hypothesis stated that distances in matrix A were 435 \nindependent of the distances in matrix B). 436 \n 437 \nTable 4 shows the results of the simple Mantel test. The results showed that 438 \ngeographic distance was not a significant factor in influencing the archaeal 439 \ncommunity composition, since P values across all OTU levels were >0.05. Therefore 440 \nhistorical events and geographic barriers to dispersal have not affected archaeal 441 \ncommunity composition. 442 \n 443 \nOnly contemporary environmental factors appear to significantly influence the 444 \narchaeal community composition. At the genus (95% OTU) and species level (97% 445 \nOTU) CO3\n2-\n, HCO3\n-\n ion concentrations and pH were significant factors in influencing 446 \narchaeal community composition since P values were <0.05. Na+ ion concentration 447 \nwas significant at the genus level only. All r\n2 \nvalues were positive, hence biotic 448 \nsimilarity of the salt lakes increased as the similarity of the environmental factors 449 \nincreased. At the sub-species level (99% OTU), pH and temperature were the only 450 \nsignificant factors. Again, all r\n2\n values were positive integers. Removal of the 451 \nArgentine data set from the analysis did not significantly change these results [50]. 452 \n 453 \nBiogeography of Bacteria 454 \nTable 5 shows the results of the simple Mantel test. The results showed that 455 \ngeographic distance was a significant factor in influencing the bacterial community 456 \ncomposition at the genus level (95% OTU) and species level (97% OTU), since P 457 \n 21 \nvalues across these OTU levels were <0.05. Both r\n2\n values were negative, hence 458 \nbiotic similarity of the salt lakes increased as the geographic distance similarity 459 \nbetween the lakes increased; i.e., the closer the lakes, the more similar the bacterial 460 \npopulations. The larger the distance between sites, the higher the likelihood of barriers 461 \nto dispersal. We therefore concluded that historical events and geographic barriers 462 \naffected bacterial community composition. At the sub-species level (99% OTU), 463 \ngeographic distance was no longer a significant factor affecting bacterial community 464 \ncomposition. Only environmental factors were significant: i.e., HCO3- ion 465 \nconcentration and pH. Omitting data from lake BJ due to the low coverage values 466 \ndoes not affect the results at the 99% or 97% OTU definitions, but at the 95% level, 467 \ntemperature and pH are no longer significant (data not shown). 468 \n 469 \nIn order to disentangle the effects of the environment versus geographic distance, the 470 \npartial Mantel test was used [42]. The effects of the environment on biotic similarity 471 \nwere tested at the genus and species level, while controlling the effects of geographic 472 \ndistance (Table 6). Na+, HCO3- ion concentrations and pH had a significant influence 473 \nat the genus level (95% OTU) and species level (97% OTU), with P values <0.05. 474 \nMg\n2+\n ion concentration was significant at the species level only. Curiously, both 475 \nHCO3- and Na+ ion concentrations had negative r\n2\n values. 476 \n 477 \nWhen the Argentinean data were removed from the analysis, environmental factors 478 \nwere again found to be significant, but not geographic distance [50]. 479 \n480 \n 22 \nDiscussion 481 \n 482 \nArchaeal Biogeography 483 \nWe report the phylogeny and distribution of Archaea in seven salt lakes across two 484 \ncontinents at almost antipodean positions to each other. Statistical analyses 485 \ndemonstrated that this distribution was significantly influenced by environmental 486 \nfactors (Na\n+\n, CO3\n2-\n, HCO3- ion concentrations, pH and temperature), see Table 4. All 487 \nr\n2\n values were positive integers, which indicated that as environmental similarity 488 \nincreased, biotic similarity increased. Geographic distance was not a significant 489 \nfactor. This was supported by phylogenetic analysis, which showed that the 490 \nArgentinean sequences were interspersed throughout the phylogenetic tree; therefore 491 \nno lineages were specific to either the Inner Mongolian or Argentinean salt lakes, see 492 \nFig 2. Our results are in contrast to a previous finding that the distribution of 493 \nhyperthermophilic archaea showed a tendency for endemism [63], despite the fact that 494 \nsome archaeal species can be air-borne [52]. This implies that unlike 495 \nhyperthermophilic archaea, haloarchaea are more robust over long distance travel - 496 \none apparent explanation for this is that hyperthermophilic archaea are less likely to 497 \nsurvive at ambient temperatures. 498 \n 499 \nThe finding that pH was a significant environmental factor in influencing haloarchaeal 500 \nbiogeography at all three definitions of OTU was not unexpected. pH would allow 501 \ndifferent species to be selected in either slightly alkaline (pH 7.5) or highly alkaline 502 \n(pH 10.5) environments, which was the pH range of the salt lakes in this study. Since 503 \npH is dependent on CO3\n2-\nand HCO3\n-\n ions, it was also not unexpected that these were 504 \nalso significant factors (although surprisingly, they were not significant at the 99% 505 \n 23 \nOTU level). Phylogenetic analysis supported this finding as haloalkaliphilic species 506 \nwere only found in the alkaline lakes, while haloarchaeal species in the other lakes 507 \nwere consistent with environments of lower pH values. For example, clones relating 508 \nto Halorubrum vacuolatum and Natronomonas sp. were only detected in Lake 509 \nChagannor (pH 10.5) and in the small pool at the unnamed lake (pH 9.5). However, it 510 \nwas unusual that other alkaliphilic groups within the Halobacteriales were not 511 \ndetected, such as those found, for example, in soda lakes in Kenya and Egypt [26, 36, 512 \n44, 53]. 513 \n 514 \nIt appeared that temperature was a significant factor in driving haloarchaeal 515 \nbiogeography at the sub-species level only (99% OTU). This implied that seasonal 516 \nchanges in temperature were important in influencing haloarchaeal biogeography. 517 \nExperiments with samples from a saltern showed that at 35\u00b0C, dense growths of 518 \nhaloarchaea were observed at 35% and 40% (w\/v) salt, but at 25\u00b0C, very little 519 \nhaloarchaeal growth was observed [15]. Temperature may also play a role in 520 \ncompetition - it was found that temperature was the deciding factor in competition 521 \nbetween moderately halophilic bacteria and haloarchaea, with bacterial growth being 522 \nfavoured at lower temperatures [57]. 523 \n 524 \nNa\n+\n ion concentration was a significant factor affecting haloarchaeal community 525 \ncomposition at the genus level (95% OTU). Haloarchaea adapt to high NaCl 526 \nconcentrations in the environment by accumulation of KCl to exclude NaCl from the 527 \ncells thereby achieving osmotic equilibrium [40]. This is an adaptation that does not 528 \nextend to Archaea outside the Halobacteriales [23]. In addition, some haloarchaeal 529 \nenzymes have evolved a requirement for high Na+ concentrations [19, 45]. 530 \n 24 \n 531 \nBacterial Biogeography 532 \nStatistical analysis showed that the distribution of Bacteria in the six salt lakes across 533 \ntwo continents was significantly influenced by geographic distance (Table 5). When 534 \nthis analysis was repeated for the Inner Mongolian samples alone, geographic distance 535 \nwas not a significant factor [data not shown; [50]], suggesting that geographic 536 \ndistance does not have a biogeographical effect at a local spatial scale. The strong 537 \nwinds observed on the steppe at the time of sampling could allow dispersal of 538 \nmicroorganisms over long distances [18, 33, 37], and so the fact that geographic 539 \ndistance became a significant factor once the Argentinean data was added to the 540 \nanalysis suggested that there may be a tendency toward endemism in halophilic 541 \nbacteria. The phylogenetic analysis implies certain lineages may be implicated in this 542 \nendemism (Fig 3). The finding that geographic distance affects bacterial biogeography 543 \nis consistent with the other studies e.g. [12, 22, 51], and has been explained by the fact 544 \nthat at large geographic distance, barriers to dispersal are more likely, and so 545 \nevolutionary events such as speciation and extinction can give rise to differences in 546 \ntwo populations separated by such barriers [32]. Our finding is consistent with 547 \nprevious studies on Thioalkalivibrio and Salinibacter ruber, which showed that 548 \nstrains of both bacterial species were endemic to certain regions, despite having 549 \ncosmopolitan distributions [22, 58]. 550 \n 551 \nGeographic distance was not a significant factor at the sub-species level (99% OTU). 552 \nOnly pH and HCO3- ion concentration were significant at this level of OTU. Again, 553 \nthe correlation to pH was not unexpected. The biogeography of bacteria in freshwater 554 \nlakes has often been correlated with pH [41, 67]. It is not hard to imagine that the 555 \n 25 \nsame effect would occur with halophilic bacteria, but to our knowledge, no other 556 \nstudies have shown this biogeographical effect. Phylogenetic analysis supported this 557 \nfinding, which showed that clones from Lake Chagannor (pH 10.5) and the pool at the 558 \nunnamed lake (pH 9.5) were related to haloalkaliphilic species such as Halomonas 559 \ncampisalis and \u2015Natronoanaerobium halophilum.\u2016 560 \n 561 \nOnce the effects of geographic distance were controlled using the partial Mantel test, 562 \nthe contemporary environmental factors found to be significant in influencing 563 \nbacterial biogeography at the genus level (95% OTU) and species level (97% OTU) 564 \nwere Na\n+\n, Mg\n2+\n and HCO3- ion concentrations and pH. The r\n2\n values for pH and Mg\n2+\n 565 \nion concentrations were positive (the higher the environmental similarity, the higher 566 \nthe biotic similarity), see Table 6. Surprisingly, the r\n2\n value for Na+ and HCO3- ion 567 \nconcentrations were negative (the higher environmental similarity, the lower the biotic 568 \nsimilarity), which does not fit what is currently known about microbial biogeography 569 \n[42], where only a positive correlations with environmental parameters have been 570 \nobserved. 571 \n 572 \nNa+ ions were significant in influencing bacterial community composition at both the 573 \ngenus (95% OTU) and species levels (97% OTU). However, unlike the haloarchaea, 574 \nhalophilic bacteria cope with high NaCl concentrations in the environment by 575 \naccumulation of organic compatible solutes [56], with only a few exceptions (for 576 \nexample, the Halanaerobiales [19, 54] and Salinibacter ruber [48]). Other sodium 577 \nsalts may influence bacterial community composition since a previous study showed 578 \nthat the high salt requirement for a moderate halophilic bacterium was met by sodium 579 \nsalts other than NaCl [47]. In addition, Na\n+\n ions are important to some alkaliphilic 580 \n 26 \nbacteria as they replace protons as the coupling ion to cope with the high external pH, 581 \nrather than increasing the electric potential difference across the cytoplasmic 582 \nmembrane [60].  583 \n 584 \nMg\n2+ \nion concentration was a significant factor in influencing the bacterial community 585 \ncomposition at the species level only (97% OTU). Mg\n2+\n favours the growth of 586 \nhaloarchaea [26], and so a possible explanation for this trend may be that only the 587 \nhalophilic bacteria that are tolerant to Mg\n2+\n are able to proliferate and co-exist with 588 \nthe haloarchaea (MgCl2 is a chaotropic agent, and is a limiting factor in the diversity 589 \nof microbes in the environment [29]).  590 \n 591 \nConclusions 592 \nUnlike other saline and soda lakes, such as those in the East African Rift Valley, these 593 \nparticular lakes are formed in depressions entirely by runoff from the surrounding 594 \ntopography. As such they are influenced by seasons and vary in salinity depending on 595 \nrainfall or spring melts. The lakes are shown as permanent sites on local maps of the 596 \nareas. [68] [66, 69] We sampled these lakes in summer months at or close to 597 \nmaximum salinity levels which last for several months \u2013 the particular prokaryote 598 \npopulation we detected reflects  the  particular set of conditions we measured at that 599 \ntime. Clearly, in an ideal world, sequential sampling over an extended time period 600 \nwould be appropriate, but logistical and financial considerations preclude repeated 601 \nvisits to these remote sites. The expedition undertaken was designed to access the 602 \nlakes during a relatively stable period of water chemistry, but still must be a 603 \ncompromise in view of the seasonality of the sites. 604 \n 605 \n 27 \nMartiny et al [42] suggested that the relative effect of the environment on microbial 606 \ncommunity composition relate to the geographical scale of sampling: at large 607 \ngeographic scales, distance seems to influence the community composition more, 608 \nwhile environment seems not to have any effect; in contrast, at a small scale it is the 609 \nenvironment which has an effect but not distance [42]. However, due to the small 610 \nnumber of studies available thus far, this conclusion should be treated with caution. 611 \nFor example, studies at large-scale distances have been carried out on prokaryotes 612 \ninhabiting extreme environments where the environmental parameters have a 613 \nrelatively small range, and focus on a particular prokaryotic species [22, 51, 63] while 614 \nstudies at small-scale distances target mixed bacterial populations  [14]. It is possible 615 \nthat this trend has arisen from the types of habitats sampled or the organism studied. 616 \n 617 \nSimilarly, we have presented a case where microbial biogeography is not so clear cut. 618 \nIt can be argued that extremophiles have larger limits to dispersal due to the lack of a 619 \nsuitable habitat. Certainly, this research has shown that bacterial biogeography is 620 \nsignificantly affected by geographic distance and therefore barriers to dispersal. This 621 \nimplies that halophilic bacteria are less mobile or less robust across large distances. 622 \nOn the other hand, geographic distance was not a significant factor in affecting 623 \narchaeal biogeography, but contemporary environmental factors were more 624 \nsignificant. This implies that Archaea are dispersed more easily or are more robust 625 \nover long distance travel. The study of microbial biogeography is still in its infancy. 626 \nOnly further case studies will show any solid tends in this field. 627 \n 628 \nAcknowledgments 629 \n 28 \nThis research was supported by the European Commission research programme 630 \n\u2017Quality of life and management of living resources\u2018, project Multigenome Access 631 \nTechnology for Industrial Catalysts (QLRT-2001-01972).
