In this paper we consider growing\nsequences of compact sets in the complex plane C obtained by com-\nposing random conformal mappings. Let D0 denote the exterior unit\ndisk\nD0 = fz 2 C1 : jzj > 1g;\nand let K0 = C n D0 be the closed unit disk. We consider a simply\nconnected set D1 \u00bd D0, such that P = Dc1 nK0 has diameter d 2 (0; 1]\nand 1 2 P . The set P models an incoming particle, which is attached\nto the unit disk at 1. There exists a unique conformal mapping\n(1) fP : D0 ! D1\nwith expansion at in\u00afnity of the form fP (z) = C(P )z + o(z) for some\nC(P ) > 0. The value C(P ) = cap(K0 [ P ) is called the logarithmic\ncapacity.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classi\u00afcation. Primary 30C35, 60D05; Secondary\n60K35, 60F99.\nKey words and phrases.

Loosely speaking we add, at the nth step, a particle\nof diameter dnj\u00a90n\u00a11(ei\u00b5n)j to the previous cluster Kn\u00a11 at the point\n\u00a9n\u00a11(ei\u00b5n).\nBy constructing the sequences f\u00b5jg and fdjg in di\u00aeerent ways, it is\npossible to describe a wide class of growth models. The most well-\nknown are the Hastings-Levitov family of models HL(\u00ae), indexed by a\nparameter \u00ae 2 [0; 2]. Here the \u00b5j are chosen to be independent random\nvariables distributed uniformly on the unit circle which, by conformal\ninvariance, corresponds to the attachment point being distributed ac-\ncording to harmonic measure at in\u00afnity. The particle diameters are\ntaken as dj = d=j\u00a90j\u00a11(ei\u00b5j)j\u00ae=2.\nIn this paper, we study a variant of the HL(0) model in which\n\u00b51; \u00b52; : : : are independent identically distributed random variables on\nthe unit circle T with common law \u00ba and dj = d. We shall refer to\nthis growth model as anisotropic Hastings-Levitov, AHL(\u00ba). Our limit\nresults are not sensitive to the shapes of particles Pj and, in fact, we\nare even able to relax the restraint dj = d, to allow for P1; P2; : : :\nto be chosen so that d1; d2; : : : are independent identically distributed\nrandom variables (independent of f\u00b5jg) with law \u00be, satisfying certain\nconditions to be stated later. 1\n1.2. Background and motivation. The motivation behind study-\ning these clusters comes from growth processes that arise in physics,\nsuch as di\u00aeusion-limited aggregation (DLA) [27], anisotropic di\u00aeusion-\nlimited aggregation [15] and the Eden model [10]. In 1998, Hastings\nand Levitov [13] formulated a conformal mapping approach to mod-\nelling Laplacian growth of which DLA and the Eden model are special\n1One way of constructing such a sequence is by \u00afxing a deterministic measurable\nmapping d 7! fP (d), such that diam(P (d)) = d, and then choosing an independent\nidentically distributed sequence d1; d2; : : : with law \u00be.\nSCALING LIMITS OF ANISOTROPIC HASTINGS-LEVITOV CLUSTERS 3\ncases. They de\u00afned the family of growth models, HL(\u00ae), whose con-\nstruction is described in the previous section. The \u00ae = 2 version is a\ncandidate for o\u00ae-lattice DLA. In this case, the diameters of the mapped\nparticles are (more or less) the same.\nThe Hastings-Levitov model has been widely discussed in the physics\nliterature. In the original paper [13], Hastings and Levitov studied the\nmodel numerically and found evidence for a phase transition in the\ngrowth behaviour at \u00ae = 1. Further numerical investigations can be\nseen in, for example, the papers [7] and [20].\nUnfortunately, the Hastings-Levitov model has proved di\u00b1cult to\nanalyse rigourously, particularly in the \u00ae > 0 case. We give a brief\nreview of the known results. In 2005, Rohde and Zinsmeister [24] es-\ntablished the existence of limit clusters for \u00ae = 0 when the aggregate\nis scaled by capacity, and showed that the Hausdor\u00ae dimension of the\nlimit clusters is 1, almost surely. They also considered a regularised\nversion of HL(\u00ae) for \u00ae > 0 and estimated the growth rate of the ca-\npacity and length of the clusters. In 2009, Johansson and Sola [14]\nstudied Loewner chains driven by compound Poisson processes. Cer-\ntain cases of these were found to correspond to HL(0) clusters with\nrandom particle sizes, and the existence of (one-dimensional) limit clus-\nters was established. The 2009 paper of Norris and Turner explored\nthe evolution of harmonic measure on the boundary of HL(0) clusters\nand showed that this converges to the coalescing Brownian \u00b0ow. We\nwould \u00afnally like to mention the 2001 and 2002 papers of Carleson\nand Makarov ([5], [6]), where the Loewner-Kufarev equation is used to\ndescribe deterministic versions of Laplacian growth.\nIn this paper we have modi\u00afed the setup of the Hastings-Levitov\nmodel in the \u00ae = 0 case. The use of more general distributions for the\nangles is a way of introducing anisotropy or localization in the growth.\nThis is similar in spirit to the work of Popescu, Hentschel, and Family\n[22], who study numerically a variant of HL(2), where the angles are\ndistributed according to a certain density with m-fold symmetry. They\nsuggest that such anisotropic Hastings-Levitov models may provide a\ndescription for the growth of bacterial colonies where the concentration\nof nutrients is directional. We discuss their work further in the next\nsection.\nAllowing for non-uniform angular distributions results in scaling lim-\nits in which the anisotropy is re\u00b0ected. We consider two di\u00aeerent nat-\nural scaling limits where we scale the particle sizes. We prove a shape\ntheorem that describes the global macroscopic behaviour of the cluster:\nin the case of uniformly distributed angles, the shape is a disk (as was\npreviously known [23]); but in the anisotropic case the limit shapes\n4 JOHANSSON, SOLA, AND TURNER\ncan be realised as non-trivial Loewner hulls. For the anisotropic case\nwe also show that the evolution of harmonic measure on the cluster\nboundary is deterministic with small random \u00b0uctuations, unlike in\nthe uniform case where the behaviour is purely stochastic.\n1.3. Outline of the paper. Our paper is organised as follows. In Sec-\ntion 2, we review some background material concerning the Loewner\nequation and the coalescing Brownian \u00b0ow and describe the general\nframework of our paper. We also discuss some examples of angular dis-\ntributions that lead to interesting anisotropic behaviour in the growth.\nIn Section 3, we establish continuity properties of the Loewner-Kufarev\nequation with respect to measures, and use this to prove a shape the-\norem for the limit clusters. In Section 4, we consider the evolution of\nharmonic measure on the cluster boundary. For general measures, we\n\u00afrst prove that the \u00b0ow on the boundary is described by an determin-\nistic ordinary di\u00aeerential equation, and then obtain a description of\nthe stochastic \u00b0uctuations around this deterministic \u00b0ow. Finally, we\nshow that uniformly chosen angles lead to purely stochastic behaviour,\neven if the particle sizes are chosen randomly.\n2. Preliminaries\nIn this section we review some background material that is needed\nfor our proofs.\n2.1. Loewner chains driven by measures. A decreasing Loewner\nchain is a family of conformal mappings\nft : D0 ! C nKt; 1 7! 1; f 0t(1) > 0;\nonto the complements of a growing family of compact sets, called hulls,\nwith\nKt1 \u00bd Kt2 for t1 < t2:\nWe always take K0 to be the closed unit disk. The logarithmic capacity\nof each Kt is given by\ncap(Kt) = lim\nz!1\nft(z)\nz\n:\nLet P = P(T) denote the class of probability measures on T. Under\nsome natural assumptions on the function t 7! cap(Kt), such a chain\ncan be parametrized in terms of families f\u00b9tgt\u00b80, \u00b9t 2 P(T). More pre-\ncisely, the conformal mappings ft satisfy the Loewner-Kufarev equation\n(3) @tft(z) = zf\n0\nt(z)\nZ\nT\nz + \u00b3\nz \u00a1 \u00b3 d\u00b9t(\u00b3);\nSCALING LIMITS OF ANISOTROPIC HASTINGS-LEVITOV CLUSTERS 5\nwith initial condition f0(z) = z. Conversely, if t 7! k\u00b9tk is locally inte-\ngrable (which is immediate for probability measures) then the solution\nto (3) exists and is a Loewner chain. See [5] for a general discussion.\nThe classical example is the case of pure point masses\n\u00b9t = \u00b1\u00bb(t);\nwhere \u00bb = \u00bb(t) is a unimodular function. The Loewner-Kufarev equa-\ntion then reduces to the equation\n(4) @tft(z) = zf\n0\nt(z)\nz + \u00bb(t)\nz \u00a1 \u00bb(t) ;\noriginally introduced by Loewner in 1923. The function \u00bb(t) is usually\ncalled the driving function. The particular choice \u00bb(t) = 1 produces as\nsolutions the basic slit mappings fd(t) : D0 ! D0 n [1; 1+d(t)], with slit\nlengths d(t) given by the explicit formula\n(5) d(t) = 2et(1\u00a1p1\u00a1 e\u00a1t)\u00a1 2:\nWe can recover (the slit version of) the HL(0) mappings \u00a9n by driving\nthe Loewner equation with a non-constant point mass at\n(6) \u00bb(t) = exp\n\u00c3\ni\nnX\nj=1\n\u00b5j\u00c2[Tj\u00a11;Tj ](t)\n!\n;\nwhere the times Tj relate to the slit lengths d via the formula (5).\nChoosing absolutely continuous driving measures\nd\u00b9t = ht(\u00b3)jd\u00b3j\nresults in the growth of the clusters no longer being concentrated at\na single point. In the simplest case d\u00b9t(\u00b3) = jd\u00b3j=2\u00bc, the Loewner-\nKufarev equation reduces to\n@tft(z) = zf\n0\nt(z);\nand we see that ft(z) = e\ntz, so that Kt = e\ntK0. We shall see that\nabsolutely continuous driving measures arise naturally in connection\nwith the anisotropic HL(0) clusters.\nWe can realize more general particles than slits using a driving func-\ntion in the following way. Consider a particle P such that @P \\D0 can\nbe described by a (su\u00b1ciently smooth) crosscut \u00af of D0. We param-\netrize \u00af(t) according to capacity, that is, cap(K0 [ \u00af[0; t)) = et; t 2\n[0; TP ), where\nTP = lcap(P ) := log(cap(K0 [ P )):\nWe can then \u00afnd a driving function for the Loewner equation that\nproduces a family ft : D0 ! D0 n \u00af[0; t). As t ! TP , the conformal\n6 JOHANSSON, SOLA, AND TURNER\nmaps ft converge uniformly on compact subsets of D0 to the mapping\nfP : D0 ! D0 n P . If \u00bb : [0; TP ) ! T denotes the driving function for\na single particle, we obtain a driving function for the cluster similarly\nto (6).\nThere is a useful relation between the diameter of the particle, its\ncapacity, and the driving function. Set R(P ) :=\np\nTP+sup0\u00b7t\u00b7TP j\u00bb(t)j.\nThen, as is proved in [19, Lemma 2.1], we have\n(7) d(P ) = diam(P ) \u00b3 R(P ):\nMoreover, one can prove that there exists a constant c <1 such that\nc\u00a11h2 \u00b7 lcap(P ) \u00b7 c hd\nfor small d; h, where h = supfjzj : z 2 Pg \u00a1 1. Indeed, the \u00afrst in-\nequality follows by comparing with the slit map solution to the Loewner\nequation. The second follows from a harmonic measure estimate and\nthe identity lcap(P ) = E[log jB\u00bf j], where Bt is a planar Brownian mo-\ntion starded from1 and \u00bf is the hitting time ofK0[P . In particular we\nsee that there are natural sequences of particles such that lcap(P ) \u00b3 d2\nas d ! 0. We shall make this assumption in certain sections of this\npaper.\nWe will sometimes need to consider the radial Loewner equation\nlifted to the real line: let \u00b0t(x) = \u00a1i log gt(e2\u00bcix)=2\u00bc, where gt = f\u00a11t\nand ft is a solution to (3) and x 2 R. Then \u00b0t satis\u00afes the di\u00aeerential\nequation\n(8) @t\u00b0t(x) =\n1\n2\u00bc\nZ 1\n0\ncot (\u00bc(\u00b0t(x)\u00a1 y)) d\u00b9t(e2\u00bciy);\nwith \u00b00(x) = x (see [18, Chapter 4]). This is well-de\u00afned as long\nas \u00b0t(x) is outside the support of \u00b9t. However, we may interpret the\nintegral in the sense of principal values, that is, as a multiple of the\nHilbert transform of the measure \u00b9t (see [12, Chapter 3]),\nH[\u00bat](x) = p:v:\n1\n2\u00bc\nZ 1\n0\ncot(\u00bc(x\u00a1 y))d\u00b9t(e2\u00bciy):\nIn this way, for nice enough measures, we obtain a di\u00aeerential equation\nde\u00afning a \u00b0ow on all of T.\n2.2. Coalescing Brownian \u00b0ow and harmonic measure on the\ncluster boundary. The coalescing Brownian \u00b0ow (also known as the\nArratia \u00b0ow and the Brownian web) can loosely be de\u00afned as a family\nof coalescing Brownian motions, starting at all possible points in con-\ntinuous space-time. Arratia [1] \u00afrst considered this object in 1979 as\na limit for discrete coalescing random walks. Since then it has been\nSCALING LIMITS OF ANISOTROPIC HASTINGS-LEVITOV CLUSTERS 7\nstudied by, amongst others, T\u00b6oth and Werner [26], Fontes, Isopi, New-\nman and Ravishankar [11] and recently Norris and Turner [21]. One of\nthe di\u00b1culties in studying the coalescing Brownian \u00b0ow is construct-\ning a suitable topological space on which a unique measure with the\nnecessary properties exists. In this section we outline the construction\nof Norris and Turner [21] and show how the coalescing Brownian \u00b0ow\nrelates to the evolution of harmonic measure on the boundary of the\nAHL(\u00ba) clusters.\nLet R be the set of non-decreasing, right-continuous functions f+ :\nR!

A shape theorem\nIn this section, we consider a scaling limit where the particle sizes\nconverge to zero. The goal is to describe the macroscopic shape of the\nlimiting cluster, that is, to prove a shape theorem. This generalizes a\nresult we \u00afrst learned about from Rohde [23], see also [20]: simulations\nof standard HL(0) clusters show that if the basic slit length d is chosen\nto be small, and the number of compositions is large, then the clusters\nKn look rounded. In fact, if we let d ! 0 and n \u00b3 d\u00a12, then the laws\nof resulting HL(0) clusters do indeed converge to that of a closed disk\ncK0.\nSimilarly, comparing the AHL(\u00ba) clusters with the hulls generated\nby the Loewner equation driven by the time-independent measure \u00ba,\nwe see that, as the particle diameters d tend to zero and the number\nof compositions increases at a rate proportional to d\u00a12, the shapes\nconverge (even for random particle sizes). Indeed, in Theorem 2 we\nprove that the discrete clusters converge to the Loewner hulls. We\nbegin with a technical result about solutions to the Loewner-Kufarev\nequation.\n3.1. Continuity properties of the Loewner equation. In this sec-\ntion, we show that solutions to the Loewner-Kufarev equation (3) are\n\\close\" at time T if the driving measures are \\close\" in some suitable\nsense. For conformal mappings, the notion of closeness is to be un-\nderstood in the sense of uniform convergence on compact subsets of\nD0.\nLet \u00a7 denote the space of conformal mappings f : D0 !

Denote by \u00a6(\u00a7) the space of probability measures\non \u00a7.\n14 JOHANSSON, SOLA, AND TURNER\nIn [2], it is shown that if the Loewner equation is driven by continuous\nfunctions that are close in the uniform metric, then the corresponding\nsolutions are close as conformal mappings. This was extended to cover\nSkorokhod space functions in [14].\nThe following proposition deals with the case of general driving mea-\nsures.\nProposition 1. Let 0 < T < 1.

Note that Cc(S) is separable.\nThus, for ' in a countable dense subset of Cc(S), we may take the\nintersection of the corresponding sets of full measure to obtain a set of\nfull measure on which h\u00b9P ; 'i converges to h\u00b9; 'i for every ' 2 Cc(S).\nHence, we have almost sure convergence of \u00b9P to \u00b9 with respect to the\nvague topology. Consequently, by Lemma 1 the random measures \u00b9P\nconverge almost surely to \u00b9 with respect to the weak topology.\nIn view of Proposition 1, the corresponding conformal mappings con-\nverge uniformly on compact sets, and the proof is complete. \u00a4\nRemark 1. The setup in the theorem can easily be adapted to allow\nfor random particle sizes tending to zero in probability. For example,\nwe could take lcap(P nk ) = \u00b8k=n for bounded i.i.d. random variables\n\u00b8k and obtain almost sure convergence of the corresponding conformal\nmappings. The proof is essentially the same, except that we apply an\nergodic theorem [4, Theorem 1] instead of the law of large numbers. We\ncan also relax the condition on the sequence \u00b8k to square-integrability,\nand then obtain convergence in law of the conformal mappings, by\nadapting the proof in [4] appropriately.\nSCALING LIMITS OF ANISOTROPIC HASTINGS-LEVITOV CLUSTERS 19\nRemark 2. Instead of choosing \u00b5j as i.i.d. random variables, one could\nalso take f\u00b5jgj to be a Markov chain satisfying some natural conditions.\nBy examining our proof, and applying a stronger version of [4, Theorem\n1], we obtain a result similar to Theorem 2, with the limiting \u00ba uniform\non T. This is a consequence of the fact that the invariant measure on\nT under rotation is Lebesgue measure.\n4. The evolution of harmonic measure on the cluster\nboundary\nIn this section we establish a scaling limit for the evolution of har-\nmonic measure on the cluster boundary. We show that it can be approx-\nimated by the solution to a deterministic ordinary di\u00aeerential equation\nrelated to the Loewner equation and we also characterise the stochastic\n\u00b0uctuations around the deterministic limit \u00b0ow.\nFor notational simplicity, we assume that the diameters fdjg of the\nparticles are constant and equal to some d > 0 which tends to zero to\nobtain limit results. All the proofs can be directly adapted for fdjg with\nlaws \u00be with \u00afnite third moment \u00be3 ! 0. We also assume that \u00ba has\ndensity h\u00ba on R, periodic with period 1, which is twice di\u00aeerentiable.\nThis restriction is purely for technical reasons and, through smoothing,\nany non-atomic Borel measure can be su\u00b1ciently well approximated by\na measure with a twice di\u00aeerentiable density.\nRecall the construction of the map \u00b0P and the \u00b0ow (\u00a1I : I \u00b5 [0;1))\nfrom Subsection 2.2.

In the case of non-uniform \u00ba, the behaviour\nof the boundary \u00b0ow (Xt)t\u00b8s is dominated by non-trivial deterministic\ndrift behaviour, and the random \u00b0uctuations only contribute as lower\norder perturbations. In the case when \u00ba is the uniform measure on\n[0; 1), however, the drift vanishes and the random \u00b0uctations describe\nthe highest order behaviour. This case is explored in detail in [21],\nwhere it is shown that under suitable scaling, the boundary \u00b0ow con-\nverges to the coalescing Brownian \u00b0ow described in Section 2.2.\nThe key result shows that the joint distribution of \u00b0ows starting\nfrom a \u00afnite collection of points in spacetime, converges to that of\ncoalescing Brownian motions. In this subsection we give an adaptation\nof this proof to HL(0) clusters constructed with random diameters.\nWe give this partly for completeness and to highlight the di\u00aeerence in\nbehaviour between the uniform case and anisotropic case, but also to\nillustrate how all of the proofs in this section can be easily adapted to\nhold in the case of random diameters.\nFor law \u00be with \u00afnite third moment \u00be3, de\u00afne \u00bd(\u00be) by\n\u00bd(\u00be)\nZ 1\n0\nZ 1\n0\n~\u00b0P (d)(x)\n2dxd\u00be(d) = 1:\nNote that \u00bd(\u00be) is well de\u00afned and \u00bd(\u00be) \u00b3 \u00be\u00a113 .\nRecall the construction of the \u00b0ow (\u00a1I : I \u00b5 [0;1)) from Subsection\n2.2 (with the drift compensated for), but constructed from particles\nwith random diameters with law \u00be, and with rate \u00bd(P ) replaced by\n28 JOHANSSON, SOLA, AND TURNER\n\u00bd(\u00be).

Write \u00b9e for\nthe distribution on De of a standard Brownian motion starting from e.\nBy a straightforward adaptation of Theorem 6, \u00b9\u00bee ! \u00b9e weakly on\nDe as \u00be3 ! 0.\nRecall the de\u00afnitions of E, DE, \u00b9E from Subsection 2.2.\nProposition 4. We have \u00b9\u00beE ! \u00b9E weakly on DE as \u00be3 ! 0.\nProof. The families of marginal laws (\u00b9\u00beek) can be shown to be tight,\nwith respect to parameter \u00be with \u00be3 < 1, by a similar argument to\nthat in Lemma 5. Hence the family of laws (\u00b9\u00beE) is also tight. Let \u00b9 be\nany weak limit law for the limit \u00be3 ! 0 and let (Zekt )t\u00b8sk , k 2 N, be a\nsequence of limit processes. For j; k distinct, the process\nX\nej\nt X\nek\nt \u00a1\nZ t\nsj_sk\nb(Xejs ; X\nek\ns )ds; t \u00b8 sj _ sk;\nis a martingale, where\nb(x; x0) = \u00bd(\u00be)\nZ 1\n0\nZ 1\n0\n~\u00b0P (d)(x\u00a1 z)~\u00b0P (d)(x0 \u00a1 z)dzd\u00be(d):\nLet \u00b8 be the smallest constant \u00b8 = \u00b8(\u00be) 2 (0; 1] such that\n\u00bd(\u00be)\nZ 1\n0\nZ 1\n0\nj~\u00b0P (d)(x+ a)~\u00b0P (d)(x)jdxd\u00be(d) \u00b7 \u00b8; a 2 [\u00b8; 1\u00a1 \u00b8]:\nIt is shown in [21] that, for d su\u00b1ciently small, if a 2 [d1=4; 1 \u00a1 d1=4]\nthen\n\u00bd(\u00be)\nZ 1\n0\nj~\u00b0P (d)(x+ a)~\u00b0P (d)(x)jdx \u00b7 d1=4:\nFor all other values of a, by Cauchy-Schwarz,\n\u00bd(\u00be)\nZ 1\n0\nj~\u00b0P (d)(x+ a)~\u00b0P (d)(x)jdx \u00b7 1:\nSCALING LIMITS OF ANISOTROPIC HASTINGS-LEVITOV CLUSTERS 29\nHence if a 2 [\u00be1=243 ; 1\u00a1 \u00be1=243 ], then for \u00be3 su\u00b1ciently small,\n\u00bd(\u00be)\nZ 1\n0\nZ 1\n0\nj~\u00b0P (d)(x+ a)~\u00b0P (d)(x)jdxd\u00be(d) \u00b7\nZ \u00be1=63\n0\nd1=4d\u00be(d)\n+ P(d > \u00be1=63 )\n\u00b7E(d1=4) + \u00be3=\u00be1=23\n\u00b7\u00be1=243 :\nHence \u00b8 \u00b7 C\u00be1=243 ! 0.\nWe have jb(x; x0)j \u00b7 \u00b8 whenever \u00b8 \u00b7 jx \u00a1 x0j \u00b7 1 \u00a1 \u00b8. Hence, by\nstandard arguments, under \u00b9, the process (Z\nej\nt Z\nek\nt : sj_sk \u00b7 t < T jk) is\na local martingale, where T jk = infft \u00b8 sj_sk : jZejt \u00a1Zekt j =2 [\u00b8; 1\u00a1\u00b8]g.\nWe know from the proof of the proposition above that, under \u00b9, the\nprocesses (Z\nej\nt : t \u00b8 sj), ((Zejt )2 \u00a1 t : t \u00b8 sj) and (Zekt : t \u00b8 sk)\nare continuous local martingales. But \u00b9 inherits from the laws \u00b9\u00beE\nthe property that, almost surely, for all n 2 Z, the process (Zejt \u00a1\nZekt + n : t \u00b8 sj _ sk) does not change sign. Hence, by an optional\nstopping argument, Z\nej\nt \u00a1 Zekt is constant for t \u00b8 T jk. It follows that\n(Z\nej\nt Z\nek\nt \u00a1 (t \u00a1 T jk)+)t\u00b8sj_sk is a continuous local martingale. Hence\n\u00b9 = \u00b9E. \u00a4\nAs observed above, X is aD\u00b1-valued random variable. Let \u00b9\u00beA denote\nthe law of X on the Borel \u00be-algebra of D\u00b1. The following result follows\nimmediately from the corresponding theorem in [21].\nTheorem 7. We have \u00b9\u00beA ! \u00b9A weakly on D\u00b1 as \u00be3 ! 0.\nCorollary 8. Let x1; : : : ; xn be a positively oriented set of points in\nR=Z and set x0 = xn. Set Kt = Kb\u00bd(\u00be)tc.

Let (B1t ; : : : ; B\nn\nt )t\u00b80 be a family of co-\nalescing Brownian motions in R=Z starting from (x1; : : : ; xn). Then, in\nthe limit \u00be3 ! 0, (!1t ; : : : ; !nt )t\u00b80 converges weakly in D([0;1); [0; 1]n)\nto (B1t \u00a1B0t ; : : : ; Bnt \u00a1Bn\u00a11t )t\u00b80.\nAcknowledgment.
