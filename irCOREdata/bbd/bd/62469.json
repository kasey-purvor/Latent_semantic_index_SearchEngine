Despite this \nlimitation, Salt succeeded in providing the scientific world with descriptions of the \nfundamental principles of insect cryobiology and a list of working hypotheses (see \nRing and Riegert, 1991 for a bibliography, plus Salt 1957; 1959). Since then our \nunderstanding of low temperature biology has benefited through technological \nadvances including the application of gas and liquid chromatography, electrophoresis, \ndifferential scanning calorimetry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and \nbiochemistry  (metabolomics). Most recently, gene chips (microarrays) have enabled \ncomparisons between gene expression in control verses treated (cold stressed) animals \nand upregulated genes can be sequenced and identified by comparison with those \nstored in a DNA sequence bank. Gene based cold tolerance studies have so far \nfocused mainly on model laboratory organisms, that is to say Drosophila \nmelanogaster (see review by Hoffmann et al. 2003) with very little effort being \napplied to understanding truly cold tolerant animals. The next step is to test emerging \nhypotheses from this work on other insects. \n \nEarly cryobiology research was driven by the need to understand outbreaks of crop \npests and more latterly by medical technologists in a bid to protect cells against \ndamage during cryo-preservation. More recently, the recognition of the global \nimplications of anthropogenic climate change has focused attention on understanding \nbiogeography and the control of species distribution patterns and dispersal (Gaston et \nal, 2008) and the establishment of invasive species (Bale, 2002). This review is \n 3\nCold insect review \nintegrates information gained from recent studies, extending our knowledge of \nseasonal adaptations in insects, by the use of advanced molecular biology techniques. \n \nGenomic resources for studying insect survival at low temperatures \nIn 2000 the draft genome of Drosophila melanogaster was published (Adams et al. \n2000). This was the second set of whole genome data to be finished, after the \nnematode C. elegans (The C. elegans Sequencing Consortium, 1998) and has been the \nreference insect genome ever since. Because of its long history in genetic research, \nDrosophila has always been used as the \u201cmodel insect\u201d. In terms of its utility in \nenvironmental studies, particularly with regard to cold tolerance: it is limited as this \nspecies is not cold hardy. Chill coma occurs at +7\u00b0C with chill injury and \ndevelopmental arrest occurring only 2\u00b0C higher at +9 to 10\u00b0C (Hosier et al. 2000; \nCohet et al. 1980). Extensive mortality takes place at temperatures below  -5\u00b0C \n(Czajka and Lee, 1990). However, the Drosophila genome data, along with that from \nother more recently targeted insects (Table 1) does provide a reference data set with \nwhich to compare ESTs (Expressed Sequence Tags) and genes isolated from other \nnon-model insects which are of more utility in cold tolerance work.  \n \nThis comparative aspect is very important, as there are relatively few characterised \nproteins in insects. Indeed even with Drosophila, which has been sequenced since \n2000 and has large numbers of researchers working on it, only one third of predicted \nprotein coding genes have been characterised with some degree of functionality \nassigned (Table 1). Three insects are currently in the annotation database \u201censembl\u201d \n(www.ensembl.org): Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae and Aedes \naegypti Liverpool LVP strain. This database is intensively curated and regularly \n 4\nCold insect review \nupdated, so a brief overview of the status of these three insect genomes reveals the \ntask ahead of those researchers interested in dissecting out the molecular mechanisms \nof cold tolerance in non-model insects (Table 1).  \nHowever with sequencing costs continually decreasing, the number of insect genomes \nbeing sequenced either to draft status or the subject of a major EST programme is \nincreasing with 56 currently listed in the GOLD (Genomes On Line Database: \nwww.genomesonline.org) and more within the NCBI dbEST collections \n(http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/dbEST\/dbEST_summary.html). Although over 50% of \nthe entries listed in GOLD are represented by Drosophila species and the rest are \nlargely crop pests or vectors of human disease, there are also other initiatives, such as \nCollembase (www.collembase.org) (Timmermans et al. 2007). This targets springtails \n(Folsomia candida and Orchesella cincta) as environmental indicators and has \nrecently added data from the EU Sleeping Beauty project, which uses the Arctic \nspringtail (Onychiurus arcticus) as a model in desiccation studies (Clark et al. 2007). \nThe sequence data from these latter species, whilst often annotated using the \nDrosophila genome data, will be of greater utility in investigations of insect cold \ntolerance. \n \nCold hardening \u2013 strategies and adaptations  \nBy the early 1960s it was realised that many factors were involved in insect cold \nhardening, principally: cryoprotectants, ice nucleators and water content. Insects were \noriginally categorised as being either freeze susceptible or freeze tolerant but these \ngroups were later subdivided when it was realised that some species have low \nsupercooling points (temperature of crystallisation \u2013 SCP) but die due to chilling \ninjury before their body fluids freeze. This group has been termed chill susceptible by \n 5\nCold insect review \nBale (Bale, 1993). Many excellent previous reviews are available, which cover the \nbasic ecophysiological mechanisms that enhance the capacity of insects to survive low \ntemperatures (Bale, 2002; Cannon and Block 1988; Danks 2005; Lee and Denlinger \n1991; Michaud and Denlinger 2004; S\u00f8mme, 1999).  \n \nInsects which are known to survive low winter temperatures may not necessarily be \ncold tolerant during warm summer periods when they are active and feeding. This is \nat least partly due to the presence of ice nucleators in their gut. Freeze avoiding \ninsects must enhance their ability to supercool and increase their chill tolerance as \nwinter approaches (seasonal cold hardening). Cold hardening prior to the onset of \nwinter may take several weeks. However, insects that experience unpredictable \nclimate variability or change require a much faster response.  \n \nExposure to a mild cold stress over a period of minutes or a few hours can increase \ncold tolerance in some insects (Chen et al. 1987; Kelty and Lee, 1999; Worland  and \nConvey, 2001). This phenomenon has been demonstrated in both chill susceptible and \nchill tolerant insects and termed rapid cold hardening (RCH). Overgaard et al. (2007)  \nused untargeted 1H NMR metabolic profiling to examine the metabolic response in \nDrosophila melanogaster during the 72h period following a low temperature \ntreatment. The most pronounced changes following RCH (gradual cooling to 0\u00b0C) \nwere elevated levels of glucose and trehalose, which correlated with improved chill \ntolerance in terms of survival and reproductive output following a cold shock at -5\u00b0C. \nA similar metabolomic-type study by Michaud and Denlinger (2006) using GC-MS \nalso showed increased levels of glycolytic metabolites associated with RCH in the \n 6\nCold insect review \nflesh fly Sarcophaga crassipalpis. However, trehalose levels were reduced, indicating \nthe different biochemical requirements of Drosophila and S. crassipalpis during RCH. \n \nCold acclimation is also known to involve complex restructuring of membranes (cf. \nRussell, 1997). The most common change is an increase in the proportion of \nunsaturated fatty acids to saturated fatty acids (Michaud and Denlinger, 2006; \nKayukawa et al. 2007). However, this is not always the case as in the firebug \nPyrrhocoris apterus which increases the relative proportion of 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleyl-\nsn-GPEtn at the expense of 1,2-dilinoleyl-sn-GPChol resulting in a slight decrease in \nthe UFH\/SFA ratio during winter acclimation (Tomcala et al. 2006). In addition to \nchanges in membrane composition, longer-term cold exposure has been shown to up-\nregulate expression of a number of different genes, including antifreeze proteins and \nheat shock proteins (HSP70s), which will be reviewed more comprehensively under \nthe section on protective mechanisms.  \n \nCryoprotectants \nAfter Chino\u2019s publication in Nature (1957) describing the accumulation of sorbitol \nand glycerol in diapausing eggs of the Bombyx silk worm, the importance of \ncryoprotectants to overwinter survival of insects was soon recognised and further \ninvestigated by Wyatt (1963) and Salt (1957, 1959). By the mid 1970s, multi-\ncryoprotectant systems were recognised consisting of glycerol and other low \nmolecular weight sugars and polyhydric alcohols including sorbitol, mannitol and \nthreitol as well as the blood sugar trehalose (see S\u00f8mme, 1982 for a review). The \nfreeze tolerance strategy relies on a variety of molecular adaptations that include the \nproduction of high concentrations of polyol cryoprotectants but also the synthesis of \n 7\nCold insect review \nice nucleators (Zachariassen and Hammel 1976, metabolic rate depression (diapause) \nand changes in gene expression (Storey, 1997; Pfister and Storey 2006). However, \nboth freeze tolerant and freeze avoiding strategies typically involve the accumulation \nof low molecular weight polyhydric alcohols, which provide antifreeze protection to \nliquid compartments (Storey and Storey 1986). The energy investment can be \nconsiderable, often in the region of 1-10% of dry mass. Polyols are often derived from \nthe catabolism of glycogen stores accumulated during summer (Worland et al. 1998). \nThe process is initiated by activation of glycogen phosphorylase by a signal \ntransduction cascade system operating at temperatures in the range of 5 to -5\u00b0C \n(Pfister and Storey ,2002; Storey and Storey 1981).  Glycogen and other \ncryoprotectants can be inter-converted in response to changing temperature (Storey \nand Storey 1986). The regulation of polyol synthesis in insects has been linked to \ndifferential cold-responsiveness of glycogen phosphorylase kinase (GPK) and protein \nphosphatase 1 (PP1) in the control of glycogen phosphorylase (Hayakawa, 1985). \nChanges in the enzymatic machinery for polyol synthesis are probably also under \nhormonal direction as part of development or diapause transitions, stimulated by \ntemperature or photoperiod as winter approaches. This is demonstrated in Ostrinia \nnubilalis where only the fifth instar larvae are capable of synthesising glycerol in \nresponse to cold stress, indicating that the moult to the overwintering stage is key to \ncompleting the synthetic pathway (Nordin et al. 1984). The activity of several other \nenzymes have been shown to change with season in the goldenrod gall fly, Eurosta \nsolidaginis, which has become an ecophysiological  model organism for freeze \ntolerance studies (Storey and Storey, 1991, 1996). These enzymes are involved in \nfatty acid metabolism, mitochondrial function and antioxidant defense in addition to \n 8\nCold insect review \npolyol synthesis and catabolism. (Joanisse and Storey, 1994a, 1994b; Pfister and \nStory, 2006). \n \nDesiccation \nMost insects avoid water loss by seeking shelter, by for example moving down \nthrough the soil profile, however some animals including nematodes (Grewal et al. \n2006), tardigrades (Hengherr et al. 2007), an insect, the chironomid Polypedilium \nvanderplanki (Kikawada et al. 2006), some Collembola (Worland et al. 1998) and \nDiptera (Bennett et al, 2003), are able to withstand significant water loss and even \nanhydrobiosis. Once water has been removed from their bodies, the threat of freezing \nis overcome. At the cellular level, the challenges faced through cold or desiccation are \nvery similar, particularly in terms of increases in solute concentration and osmotic \nstress, reduction in supercooling point and membrane shrinkage (Convey, 2000). \nDesiccation and cold tolerance are considered to be overlapping adaptations (Ring and \nDanks, 1994) eliciting similar responses to limit injury during periods of extreme \nenvironmental conditions. A common feature of many anhydrobiotic and cold tolerant \norganisms is the accumulation of trehalose, which stabilises membranes by interacting \nwith the phosphate of phospholipids (Crowe et al. 1992). The accumulation of sugars \nand polyols seems to be a common trait of both cold and drought tolerant ectotherms.  \nExposing D. melanogaster to desiccating conditions can elicit an increase in \ndesiccation resistance (Hoffmann, 1990) in the same way that cold hardening \nimproves cold tolerance (Hoffmann and Parsons, 1993). Pre-treatment to high and low \ntemperatures can also increase desiccation tolerance a phenomenon termed adaptive \ncross tolerances (Tammariello et al. 1999) as demonstrated in D. melanogaster \n(Hoffmann and Parsons, 1993). Similarly, acclimation to drought stress can improve \n 9\nCold insect review \ncold tolerance (Forge and MacGuidwin, 1992; Bayley et al. 2001; Holmstrup et al. \n2002). The composition of membrane phospholipids fatty acids (PLFA) changes \nduring drought acclimation with an increase in the degree of unsaturation (in the \ntropical springtail Folsomia candida). (Holmstrup et al. 2002). This is similar to \nchanges that occur in cold stressed ectotherms and is an important physiological \nadaptation probably involved in maintaining membrane lipid fluidity during drought \nand cold stress.  \n \nProtective mechanisms  \nAs well as physiological adaptation to the cold, there are also a number of well-\ncharacterised  biochemical and genetic mechanisms which can protect the animal \nagainst the effects of lowered environmental temperatures and freezing. \n \n \nAntifreeze proteins and thermal hysteresis \nAntifreeze proteins (AFPs) depress the freezing point of fluids by adsorbing to seeded \nice crystals and inhibiting their growth (Raymond and DeVries 1977). AFPs lower the \nfreezing temperature below the melting point, a phenomena known as thermal \nhysteresis (TH). Typical fish plasma freezes at about 1\u00b0C below the freezing point of \nseawater (-1.9\u00b0C). Although this is only a modest degree of undercooling, it is \nsufficient to protect fish in what is a comparatively stable thermal environment \n(Duman and DeVries, 1974). Since the discovery of antifreeze glycoproteins proteins \nin Antarctic fish by DeVries (1971) analogous macromolecular antifreeze compounds \nhave been found in various insects including the darkling beetle, Meracantha \ncontracta (Duman, 1977) and the spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana \n 10\nCold insect review \n(Tyshenko et al. 2005; Qin et al. 2007). At least 50 insects are now known to produce \nAFPs (see Duman et al. 2004, for a species list), although many of these have only \nlow levels of thermal hysteresis. This either may be a function of the season the \nsamples were collected or in some cases the way the animals were acclimated. Low \nlevels of AFPs can be beneficial to freeze tolerant species by preventing re-\ncrystallisation while still allowing nucleation and so preventing deep supercooling \n(Tursman et al. 1994) which would result in rapid ice growth and physical damage to \ncells. Recently it has become apparent that some insect antifreeze proteins are much \nmore potent than those in fish (Scotter et al. 2006) and are the subject of \nbiotechnological interest. This has come about with the ability to purify the proteins \nand express them in recombinant systems, as discussed below. \n \nAlthough the vast majority of insect AFP work has concentrated on detecting and \nmeasuring thermal hysteresis in haemolymph (c.f  Duman et al. 2004), a number of \ninsect AFPs have now been purified and sequenced from the mealworm (Tenebrio \nmolitor) (Graham et al. 1997), the pyrochoroid beetle (Dendroides canadensis) \n(DAFP) (Duman et al. 1998; Andorfer and Duman, 2000), the snow flea \n(Hypogastrura harveyi) (Graham and Davies, 2005) and the spruce budworm \n(Choristoneura fumiferana) (cfAFP) (Tyshenko et al. 2005). Comparison of sequence \ndata from these four insects reveals very little sequence similarity between them, \nindicating that similar to the situation of antifreeze evolution in teleost fish (Chen et \nal, 1997), insect AFPs have evolved independently from different progenitors \n(Graham and Davies, 2005). Again, similarly to fish, the AFPs studied in detail \nconsist of multi-gene families with at least 17 isoforms of  cfAFP (Doucet et al. 2002; \nTyshenko et al. 2005) and 13 isoforms of DAFP (Andorfer and Duman, 2000) \n 11\nCold insect review \ncharacterised to date. The existence of multiple copies of slightly different isoforms of \nthe same gene would appear to have adaptive significance, as seasonal analysis of two \nDAFPs (dafp-1 and dafp-7) reveals differential transcription and the 6 isoforms of \ncfAFP show developmental-specific expression patterns (Qin et al. 2007). Hence, it \nhas been hypothesised that these proteins may serve additional functions to that of \nantifreezes depending on the environmental signals (Andorfer and Duman, 2000), if \nindeed they are under environmental control (Qin et al. 2007).  \n \nCloning, sequencing and subsequent manipulation of these insect AFP genes has \nproduced a greater understanding of their function. Some have been expressed and \nstudied in E.coli transgenic systems (Graham et al. 1997; Graham and Davies, 2005), \nwhilst others have been expressed either in insect transgenic lines (Tyshenko and \nWalker, 2004; Nicodemus et al. 2006; Qin et al. 2007) or transformed into a plant \n(Arabidopsis thaliana) (Huang et al. 2002). Such techniques have revealed that some \ninsect AFPs are more active than those so far described in fish by over 2 orders of \nmagnitude. For example the antifreeze protein isolated from the beetle Tenebrio \nmolitor has a specific activity 100 times that of a typical fish AFP (Graham et al. \n1997) and has been termed \u201chyperactive\u201d. Similarly high activity levels have been \nobserved in Hypogastrura  harveyi and Choristoneura fumiferana (Graham and \nDavies, 2005, Qin et al. 2007).  \n \nSo how are these antifreezes activated and how do they protect cells from cold \ndamage? Whilst expression of a DAFP in Arabidopsis thaliana produced transgenic \nplant lines with measurable thermal hysteresis activity in apoplast fluid, the plants did \nnot show an improved ability to survive freezing when compared with wild-type, \n 12\nCold insect review \nalthough the transgenic lines with AFPs in the apoplast fluid froze at significantly \nlower temperatures than wild-type (Huang et al. 2002). This lack of improved ability \nto survive freezing was unexpected, but may have been due to problems in the \nintrinsic structural properties of the AFPs such as post translational modifications, or \nmore likely, expression in a heterologous non-insect system. More recent studies have \neither expressed insect AFPs in insect cell lines or produced transgenic flies, which \nhas been a more successful approach. Luciferase reporter assays of genomic clones \nfrom (CfAFP2.26 and CfAFP2.7) in a C. fumiferana cell line has lead to the \nidentification of two 5\u2019 promotor regions (Qin et al. 2007). This is a first step towards \nunderstanding the complex regulatory patterns of AFP expression in this species, in \nwhich 17 isoforms display markedly different developmental patterns. Expression \nstudies indicate that these genes are potentially under neuroendocrine control, as they \nappear relatively insensitive to environmental triggers. Earlier studies introduced a \nDAFP-1 gene (from D. canadensis) and cfAFP337 (from C. fumiferana) into \nDrosophila stocks (Tyshenko and Walker, 2004; Nicodemus et al. 2006, \nrespectively). Whilst DAFP-1 transgenic flies were able to live longer at 0\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C \nthan controls, the effects were small. In the case of the cfAFP337 transgenic line, high \nlevels of thermal hysteresis were measured, but the transgenic lines did not display \nany cold resistance when compared to wild type.  \n \nThese experiments demonstrate that transgenic AFPs can be correctly processed and \nare demonstratively active in transgenic systems, but they do not absolutely emulate \nthe thermal hysteresis properties of AFPs in the native animals. There are several \npotential reasons for this:  \n 13\nCold insect review \n\u2022 AFPs are generally multiple gene families and thermal hysteresis \nmeasurements of haemolymph cannot distinguish between the different \nisoforms, which frequently exist as a mix and it may be this combination of \nforms, which confers the cold tolerance (Nicodemus et al. 2006). \n\u2022 Stabilisation of cell membranes is thought to play a large part in cold \nresistance and the transgenic AFPs may not be present in high enough \nconcentrations to contribute to membrane stability, even if the proteins are \ncorrectly post-translationally modified and integrated into membranes \n(Tyshenko and Walker, 2004; Nicodemus et al. 2006). \n\u2022 Additional synergistic components (such as glycerol) may be required to \nstabilise cellular membranes at low temperatures (Tyshenko and Walker, \n2004; Nicodemus et al. 2006). Certainly it has bee shown that D. canadensis \nincreases the THP activity of AFPs by accumulating glycerol and enhancer \nproteins (Wu and Duman, 1991; Duman 2001). \nIt is only now, with the production of transgenic constructs in insect vector systems, \nthat we are beginning to understand the complexity of AFP action in insects. It \ncertainly is not a simple case of producing AFPs and achieving cold tolerance. \n \nRecrystallization inhibition \nFreeze tolerant species may also produce antifreeze proteins along with ice nucleating \nproteins. One explanation by Knight and Duman (1986) for this seemingly anomalous \nsituation is that these proteins prevent a size increase of individual ice crystals \n(recrystallization), which would otherwise cause physical damage to cells.  \n \n 14\nCold insect review \nIce Nucleators \nThe temperature at which ice forms in insect body fluids is regulated by ice nucleators \nwhich seed the formation of ice crystals (Salt, 1961, 1966). Initial studies on bacterial \nnucleators indicated that protein, carbohydrate and lipid components of the outer \nmembrane are essential for nucleation activity. Ice nucleators have also been \nidentified in the extracellular fluids of freeze tolerant invertebrates (Neven et al. \n1989). These restrict ice formation to the extracellular fluids \n \nRemoving such nucleators can result in an increase in the animal\u2019s ability to supercool \n(S\u00f8mme and Block, 1982) a process which is further enhanced by the colligative \naction of low molecular weight cryoprotective compounds (Zachariassen, 1991). \nParticles of food and bacteria in the guts of insects are thought to be potential ice \nnucleators (Lee et al. 1991; Worland and Luke\u0161ov\u00e1, 2000) but can be removed by \ncessation of feeding at low temperatures, although there is no evidence for deliberate \nejection of gut contents in response to low temperatures. Recently, the effect of \nmoulting on supercooling ability has been studied in Collembola (Worland, 2005; \nWorland et al. 2006). Moulting might be expected to depress the SCP, because in \nCollembola the mid-gut and its entire contents are shed during this process (Thibaud, \n1968) resulting in the expulsion of potential ice nucleators. Although this is still the \nsubject of debate, recent microarray studies similarly indicate a correlation between \nlow SCPs and moulting (Pura\u0107 et al. submitted). Genes coding for cuticle proteins are \nup-regulated in low SCP animals, interpreted as indicating that a significant \nproportion of the low SCP population were undergoing moulting (Pura\u0107 et al. \nsubmitted).  \n 15\nCold insect review \n \nHeat shock proteins \nHeat shock proteins are expressed in most organisms in response to a wide range of \nstressful environmental conditions (reviewed in Feder and Hofmann, 1999) and are \ngenerally viewed as a protective cellular mechanism. The role of HSPs in protecting \ninsects against heat and desiccation stress is well understood (Goto and Kimura 1998; \nGoto et al. 1998). These genes are a family of highly conserved proteins, which act as \nchaperones to stabilise and refold  denatured proteins,  preventing the formation of \ncytotoxic aggregates (Parsell and Lindquist, 1993; Hartl, 1996; Fink, 1999). \nNumerous families of heat shock proteins have been identified, the naming of which \nis related to their molecular weight in kiloDaltons. For example, the most studied of \nthe family members are the 70kD heat shock proteins (HSP70s), comprising both \nconstitutive (HSC70: heat shock cognate 70) and stress inducible (HSP70s: heat shock \nprotein 70) isoforms. Their popularity in molecular studies is largely because these \ngenes are highly conserved at the molecular level and therefore relatively easy to \nclone and evaluate in different species, even where there is limited or no genome data \navailable for that species. \n \nThe classical activation of the inducible HSP70 genes is in response to elevated \nenvironmental temperatures and expression is tightly regulated by the heat shock \ntranscription factor (HSF1) (reviewed in Morimoto, 1998). However, heat is not the \nonly activator, with anoxia, starvation and desiccation also identified as inducers \n(Salvucci et al. 2000; Parsell and Lindquist, 1993). The induction and expression of \nthe HSP70\u2019s is highly plastic, with cellular levels influenced by factors such as \nthermal history and seasonal temperature cycling (reviewed in Hofmann, 2005). \n 16\nCold insect review \nIndeed, it has been suggested that the temperatures for onset (Ton) and maximal \ninduction (Tmax) of gene expression of HSPs are useful indicators of thermal tolerance \n(Tomanek and Somero, 1999 ) and can be used to help define geographical \ndistribution limits, as has been demonstrated in the case of two Liriomyza species \n(Huang and Kang, 2007).  \n \nThe temperature, at which heat shock proteins are produced, varies according to the \nspecies and habitat; for example they are induced above 43\u00b0C in S. crassipalpis \n(Joplin and Denlinger, 1990) and 45\u00b0C in the desert locust Locusta miggratoria \n(Whyard et al. 1986). But high temperature stress (although the classical activator of \nHSPs) is not the subject of this review per se and this section will concentrate on their \nactivation by cold stress. Transcribing, translating and folding proteins at high \ntemperatures is well known, but cold denaturation of proteins is also documented \n(Privalov, 1990). For example, the constitutive production of inducible HSP70 is a \nknown feature of polar marine species (Place et al. 2004, Clark et al. 2008) as a \npresumed adaptation to life in the cold and the consequential problems of folding \nproteins at low temperatures.  \n \nHSPs are induced in response to cold shock in most insects studied to date, although \nthe number of examples is limited (Nunamaker et al. 1996; Rinehart and Denlinger, \n2000; Yocum, 2001; Chen et al. 2005, Rinehart et al. 2006a; 2007). The exception to \nthis general rule would appear to be Drosophila where studies of HSP70 and its \nassociated regulator gene, the heat shock transcription factor (HSF-1) show negligible \nchange of expression levels in either cold stress resistance or rapid cold hardening \n(RCH) (Kelty and Lee, 2001; Nielsen et al. 2005). However, as stated earlier, \n 17\nCold insect review \nDrosophila is not an ideal model when it comes to the investigation of insect cold \ntolerance and although HSP70 is not up-regulated in response to cold shock, this does \nnot mean that other HSP genes, particularly the smaller HSPs are not. No doubt this \nwill be investigated in the future. Interestingly HIF-1\u03b1 was substantially increased in \nthe goldenrod gall fly larva (Eurosta solidaginis) with cold exposure (Morin et al, \n2005). \n \nAn interesting twist to the use of HSPs as a protective cellular mechanism in cold \nshock is provided by the work of Rinehart et al. (2006b). Their studies on the \nAntarctic flightless midge Belgica antarctica show continuous up-regulation of HSPs \n(Hsp70, Hsp90 and smHsp) in larvae, but not the adult stages, with the latter \ndisplaying the classical activation patterns in response to both high and low \ntemperatures. The reason behind these stage\u2013specific differences in gene expression \nhas been suggested as being linked to niche thermal stability.  The larval stages last up \nto two years with the animals surviving under rocks and in soil and vegetation, \nexperiencing a temperature range of no more than 4\u00b0C. In contrast, the adults live \nonly a couple of weeks in the austral summer and can be exposed to highly fluctuating \ntemperatures between 0\u00b0C and +22\u00b0C. Therefore, the adults need protection against \nhigh, as well as low temperatures and the inducible mechanism is clearly the most \nenergetically efficient way to achieve this. Conversely, the larvae, with their restricted \nstable temperature regime are in a situation akin to the Antarctic marine organisms \nand in this case the constitutive expression can be seen as a common adaptation to the \nAntarctic environment, with a strong requirement for facilitating proper folding of \nproteins at low temperatures (Rinehart et al. 2006b; Place et al. 2004; Clark et al. \n2008). \n 18\nCold insect review \n \nHSPs can be induced by cold shock and a range of other stressors and clearly the \nregulatory mechanisms governing these genes are complex. They are also associated \nwith diapause, and also recovery from cold shock. In each case, the nature and extent \nof the shock is different. Cold shock is an unpredictable acute stress, whereas \ndiapause is a programmed elongated chronic stress and HSPs have the necessary \nregulatory capacity to deal with all situations (Rinehart et al. 2007). \n \n \nDesiccation pathways \nCan desiccation protect against cold shock? Are the biochemical pathways involved in \neach of these two types of stresses the same? There are few reports in the literature on \nmolecular level studies to investigate the response of insects to desiccation. The heat \nshock proteins (Hsp23 and Hsp70) were upregulated in desiccating flesh fly pupae (S. \ncrassipalpis) (Tammariello et al. 1999). This was substantiated in the adults, whilst \nHsp90 and Hsc70 were shown to be unresponsive (Hayward et al. 2004). However, \nexpression levels of these genes did depend on the diapause status of the insect. Hsp \n23 and Hsp70 are highly expressed during diapause, but not responsive to additional \ndesiccation stresses, whilst in this state. Similarly, expression levels of smHsp, Hsp70 \nand Hsp90 are permanently upregulated in the larvae of Belgica antarctica and \nexpression levels cannot be further enhanced under any type of desiccation stress \n(Hayward et al. 2007). So there is potentially a trade-off in the cellular energetics for \nHsp requirements. As regards non-hsp genes, so far only a novel desiccation protein \n(dsp28) has been identified in the beetle Tenebrio molitor (Graham et al. 1996), smp-\n30 in Drosophila (Sinclair et al. 2007), although this gene was originally a candidate \n 19\nCold insect review \nfor cold hardening and an LEA (late embryogeneis abundant) protein in the \nchironomid Polypedilum vanderplanki (Kikawada et al. 2006). No doubt, with more \nhigh throughput technologies, such as microarrays and proteomics becoming \nintegrated within insect physiology, this paucity of information will change, enabling \nus to draw comparisons between biochemical pathways activated by different stresses \ni.e. is cold stress different to desiccation stress at the cellular level? \n \nDiapause (developmental-stage-specific cold survival) \nWinter dormancy is common across a range organisms. Diapause is an endocrine \nmediated dormancy that occurs at a specific developmental stage, requiring specific \ncues for its initiation and is also widespread among insects. Facultative diapause is \nprogrammed by environmental factors, (normally temperature and daylength) that are \nperceived before diapause begins allowing insects to predict the onset of harsh \nseasonal conditions (see Denlinger 2002 for a review of diapause regulation). The \ninsect thus anticipates the adverse season and prepares for the dormant period by \nsequestering additional nutrient reserves and seeking a suitable hibernaculum. \nAlthough we know that developmental arrest is due to an alteration in hormone titers, \nwe do not know how the brain interprets environmental information and how it is \nrelayed via the endocrine system. Diapause and cold hardiness are potential elements \nof winter survival for many insects in temperate zones but few studies have examined \nhow the two are related. It should be noted that diapause is thought to be rare in Polar \ninvertebrates as the environments are extreme enough to make false cueing likely \n(Convey, 1996). \n \n 20\nCold insect review \nMolecular information on diapause is limited to a few species. These include D. \nmelanogaster, which has an adult diapause stage. However, it is not considered to be \nthe most appropriate model organism for diapause studies (Denlinger, 2002).  Studies \nso far, have concentrated on cloning and analysis of candidate genes, of which, the \nheat shock proteins predominate. However a distinction has to be drawn between \nthose genes, which are involved in diapause regulation and those, which have closely \nassociated regulatory mechanisms or function alongside diapause programming. Of \nthe latter, there is not an all-encompassing pattern for a named gene as species-\nspecific differences have been identified (Table 2) such as the differential up- and \ndown-regulation of Hsp90 in S. crassipalpis and D. antiqua. \n \nThe situation, certainly with regard to the HSPs is more complex. Although there are \ndocumented associations of HSP gene expression with diapause (Table 2), these genes \nare also still responsive to additional external environmental stimuli, even when the \ninsects are in a dormant state (e.g. Rinehart and Denlinger, 2000; Yocum, 2001; Chen \net al. 2005) and their expression, even during diapause can be dependant on the \nthermal history of the animal under study (Yocum et al. 2005). Hence it has been \nproposed that the HSP association with diapause is a continuation of their known \nfunction of stress adaptation and that this enables insects to survive dormant stages \nsuch as diapause, which are effectively bridging stages in environmental adversity \n(Hayward et al. 2005). This is supported by RNAi experiments using Hsp23 and \nHsp70 in the flesh fly. Suppression of Hsp23 and HSP70 expression did not alter the \ndecision to enter diapause or its duration, but had a profound effect on the pupa\u2019s \nability to survive low temperatures and so is considered to be a major factor \ncontributing to cold hardiness of overwintering insects (Rinehart et al. 2007). \n 21\nCold insect review \nCertainly, at least in the case of the flesh fly, diapause is accompanied by the \naccumulation of cryoprotectants (glycerol), which again, although the glycerol \npathway genes do not control diapause, the resultant product affects the ability of the \nflesh fly to survive this environmentally stressful period (Hayward et al. 2005). This \ngene-based study was supported by metabolomics data in which the metabolites \ninvolved in glycolysis were elevated by diapause treatments (Michaud and Denlinger, \n2007) and it is particularly rewarding when different approaches to the same question \nproduce supporting evidence. In the metabolomics study, the amino acids alanine and \nleucine were also increased and high alanine levels have been shown to have a \nsynergistic colligative effect with other solutes, emphasizing again the complex \ninteractions involved in such adaptations and these may not necessarily be identified \nsolely at the transcription level. \n \nAs regards the identification of genes, which act as triggers for diapause, so far only \ntwo candidates have been identified. The action of one of these, the aptly named \n\u201cdiapause hormone\u201d (DH) is discordant in the two species examined so far. It has \nbeen shown to induce embryonic diapause in the silk moth (B. mori) (Denlinger, \n2002), yet conversely injections of DH prompt the termination of pupal diapause in \nboth H. virescens and H. armigera (Xu and Denlinger, 2003). The picture with p38 \nMAPK is more consistent, with a role emerging in both the initiation and termination \nof diapause in the three species examined to date (Atrachya menetriesi, Bombyx mori \nand Sarcophaga crassipalpis), an involvement which has been monitored by both \ntranscription and protein phosphylation studies (Kidokoro et al. 2006; Fujiwara et al. \n2006; Fujiwara and Denlinger 2006).  \n \n 22\nCold insect review \nAs stated earlier, so far the studies on diapause have involved the investigation of \nsingle genes. However, with microarrays and proteomics, there are now technologies \nfor examining hundreds of genes\/proteins at the same time. Indeed the continuing \ninterest on diapause has expanded via a proteomics study comparing brain extracts of \ndiapausing and nondiapusing flesh fly pupa (Li et al. 2007). Thirty-seven diapause-\nunique or upregulated proteins were identified, of which, not surprisingly given \nprevious studies, the HSPs predominated. This nicely complements the \ntranscriptomics study of Rinehart et al. (2007) and adds confirmatory evidence that \nmRNAs upregulated during diapause are indeed translated into functional proteins \n(which does not always necessarily follow). Forty-three proteins were downregulated, \nsome of which could be identified and broaden our picture of diapause-related cellular \nevents. These included phosphoenolpyruvate synthase, fatty acid binding protein and \nendonuclease, which are related to metabolic processes and consequently less active \nduring diapause (Li et al. 2007). One point highlighted during this study was the \ninability to identify some of the abundant protein spots. This will always be a problem \nwith non-model species, but hopefully the possibilities of identifying genes and \nproteins by comparative database approaches will improve as the number of insect \nsequences in the databases increase. \n \nMembrane lipids \nThe transition of cell membrane lipids from a liquid crystalline phase to a gel phase is \none of the important causes of cold injuries under non-freezing conditions (Drobnis et \nal. 1993). Increasing the concentration of unsaturated fatty acids is considered to have \na role in maintaining the liquid crystalline phase of cell membranes at low \ntemperatures. Hence it is not surprising that changes are detected in the composition \n 23\nCold insect review \nof membrane phospholipids associated with diapause and increased cold tolerance in \ninsects (Cossins, 1994).  This remodelling of cell membrane lipids in response to \nchanges in temperature is termed homeoviscous adaptation (HVA). HVA at low \ntemperatures has been studied in several insects: Pyrrhocoris apterus (Slachta et al. \n2002); Drosophila species (Ohtsu et al 1998), Eurosta solidaginis (Bennett et al. \n1997), Delia antiqua (Kayukawa et al. 2007), Chymomyza costata (Ko\u0161t\u00e1l et al. 2003) \nand Sarcophaga crassipalpis (Michaud and Denlinger, 2007). In the C. costata \nexample the transition to diapause was accompanied by an increase in the molar \nproportion of molecular species containing palmitic\/linoleic (16\/18.2) fatty acids \nesterified to sn-1\/sn-2 positions of glycerol. In Delia antiqua, palmitoleic acid (C16:1) \nin phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and oleic acid (C18:1) in phosphatidylcholine (PC) \nwere significantly increased in pupae with enhanced cold hardiness (Kayukawa et al. \n2007) and in S. crassipalpis oleic acid contributed to 58% of the total fatty acid pool \non entering diapause from a basal level of 30%, which represents a considerable re-\nmodelling of both fatty acid metabolism, but also membrane structure (Michaud and \nDenlinger, 2007). \n \nThe enzyme \u22069-acyl-CoA desaturase plays an essential role in HVA by increasing the \nratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids in cell membranes and is expressed at low \ntemperatures in fish (Tiku et al. 1996), bacteria (Sakamoto and Bryant, 1997), plants \n(Vega et al. 2004), and insects (Kayukawa et al. 2007). Insect \u22069-acyl-CoA \ndesaturase sequences have been characterised in D. melanogaster (Dallerac et al. \n2000) the cabbage looper moth, Trichoplusia ni (Liu et al. 1999), the silkworm \nBombyx  mori (Yoshiga et al. 2000) and the house fly Musca domestica (Eigenheer et \nal. 2002). Based on their broad tissue distribution, it has been proposed that they are \n 24\nCold insect review \nimportant for homeostasis and development in addition to being involved in sex-\nspecific pheromone production (Eigenheer et al. 2002). However, Kayukawa et al. \n(2007) also demonstrated their role in cold hardiness, showing an increase in \nexpression of the Delia antiqua \u22069-acyl-CoA desaturase with cold hardiness \ntreatments, which were accompanied by a concomitant increase in the production of \npalmitoleic and oleic acids (the presumed products of \u22069-acyl-CoA desaturase). \n \nMitochondrial degradation  \nStudies have linked polyol production to diapause, metamorphosis, hypoxia, cold \nshock, and heat shock (Lee et al. 1987). These metabolic states apparently involve \noxidative metabolism, possibly linked to changes in mitochondria (Kukal 1991). \nInvestigations of the lymantriid moth Gynaephora groenlandica show that prolonged \ncold acclimation results in glycerol synthesis together with a large reduction in the \nnumber of mitochondria in fat body and brain cells (Kukal et al. 1989). A more recent \nstudy used molecular techniques (densitometry of dots blots and Northern blots) to \nanalyse mitochondrial copy number and gene transcription in larvae of E. solidaginis \nand G. groenlandica to assess whether mitochondrial degradation is an adaptive \nphysiological response to cold (Levin et al. 2003). This study concluded that although \nmitochondrial (mt) DNA content was reduced in cold adapted larvae, stable \nmitochondrial-specific mRNAs were preserved over winter in fat body cells of both E. \nsolidaginis and G.  groenlandica. This enabled mtDNA content (and consequently \nmetabolic activity) to recover rapidly to original levels when larvae were warmed to \n10 or 15\u00b0C (Levin et al. 2003).  \n \nUnique gene and proteins associated with cold shock \n 25\nCold insect review \nAs HSP genes are relatively easily cloned from a wide range of organisms, their \ncharacterisation in association with cold shocks and cold acclimation predominate in \nthe available molecular data. Genetic analyses have also concentrated on antifreeze \nproteins and enzymes involved in the production of cryoprotectants such as glycerol, \nas these are known chemicals that accumulate during cold acclimation. As these genes \nhave largely been discussed previously, the aim of this section is to concentrate on \nother types of gene (summarised in Table 3). \n \n Subtractive hybridization and selection techniques have identified candidate genes, \nsuch as Dca and EsMlp (Goto, 2000; 2001; Bilgen et al. 2001). In the first study a \ngene (Dca: Drosophila cold acclimation gene) was identified in Drosophila, which \nshowed homology to the mammalian senescence marker protein-30 (SMP-30) (Goto, \n2000). This gene was suggested to have a role in the maintenance of cytosolic Ca2+ \nlevels, which may become raised as part of the stress response. Transcripts for a gene \nwith 94% identity at the amino acid level to D. melanogaster LIM protein (Stronach \net al. 1996) were found in the goldenrod gall moth E. scudderiana after exposure to \nlow temperatures (Bilgen at al 2001). Muscle LIM proteins are essential for \nmyogenesis and promote differentiation of striated muscle (Arber et al. 1994). As \nEsMlp was also upregulated in field populations overwinter it was proposed that this \nprotein may have some role to play in either muscle restructuring at sub-zero \ntemperatures or as a preparative function to facilitate rapid development and \nmetamorphosis in the spring. In an alternative approach Fujiwara and Denlinger \n(2007) studied the phosphorylation of the p38 MAPK (mitogen activated protein \nkinase) in S. crassipalpis in response to RCH. They were able to show an increase in \nphospho-p38 MAPK activity within 10 minutes of cold hardening treatments. This is \n 26\nCold insect review \nan interesting study in that it targets a signalling molecule (and by inference a \nmolecule at the upper end of the RCH gene cascade) rather than the gene end \nproducts, which is more usually the case in transcriptomics studies. \n \nAlthough to a large extent, the subtractive and candidate gene approach has been \nreplaced by microarray type techniques, there is still an interest in particular types of \ngene, which based on their function in other organisms will, almost certainly play a \nrole in cold acclimation. This category includes the aquaporins. These genes were \ndiscovered as recently as 1992 by Agre et al. (1993) and are integral membrane \nproteins. They are characterised by six transmembrane helices forming pores that \nselectively allow water or other small-uncharged molecules to pass along an osmotic \ngradient (Kruse et al. 2006). Aquaporins have been identified and cloned in D. \nmelanogaster, two species of mosquito: Aedes aegypti (Pietrantonio et al. 2000) and \nAnopheles gambiae and most recently identified in an Artic springtail (O. arcticus) \nEST project (Clark et al. 2007). There are no publications so far which show a direct \ninvolvement of aquaporins in cold hardening in insects. However, their role in \ncontrolling the flow of water and glycerol (in the case of the glycerol-permeable \nhomologs- aquaglyceroporins) and additional functions in osmoregulation and \nmetabolite transport, suggest that further studies of aquaporin gene expression may \nshow this to be the case. \n \nOther approaches include the use of microarrays (Qin et al. 2005), exploitation of \ngenome data (Sinclair et al. 2007) and proteomics (Colinet et al. 2007). Only the latter \ninvestigated a non-model organism: the parasitic wasp (Aphidus colemani), whilst the \nothers concentrated on Drosophila. Hybridization and microarray analysis of 12,000 \n 27\nCold insect review \nDrosophila clones only identified 37 transcripts that were up-regulated in response to \ncold hardening in Drosophila. Not surprisingly, given the previous discussions, the \nmajority of these transcripts coded for either heat shock proteins or membrane \nproteins. However, it was also possible, using functionality of proteins derived from \nsequence similarity data to identify a potential shift from carbohydrate to fatty acid \noxidative pathways during this process. A similar shift appears during hibernation and \nit is plausible that both cold hardening and hibernation may share similar mechanisms \n(Qin et al. 2005).  \n \nSinclair et al. (2007) took a slightly different approach, by exploiting the Drosophila \ngenome data and analysing the transcription of 5 candidate genes (Frost, Smp-30, \nHsp23, Hsp70a and desaturase 2) during cold stress in Drosophila. Some of these \ngenes had been previously implicated in cold stress (Goto, 2000; 2001), but real time \nPCR enabled far more accurate time course experiments to be performed. Cold stress \ndid not up-regulate the expression of any of these genes, but Hsp70 and Frost were \nimplicated as being important during the recovery phase. This study emphasized the \nimportance of being able to accurately differentiate between the exposure and \nrecovery phases and this aspect was mirrored in the proteomics study (Colinet et al. \n2007) of A. colemani, which studied both fluctuating temperature regimes (FTR) and \nconstant cold temperature (CLT) treatments. Most proteins were associated with \nrecovery phases, whilst only 4 were associated with CLT; a chitin binding protein, a \ncuticular protein, an ATPase and a leucine rich repeat protein of unknown function. \nThe lack of significant amounts of up-regulated protein during exposure to cold \ntemperatures may be due to a reduction in protein synthesis in the cold, with the \nproduction of cuticle proteins continued under this regime as development continues \n 28\nCold insect review \neven under low temperature conditions (Colinet et al. 2007). So, although these most \nrecent approaches are providing valuable information on cold tolerance (even for non-\nmodel organisms), they are intriguingly, posing further questions about the nature and \ncomplexity of cold adaptation biochemistry. \n \nInjury and Recovery from cold shock   \nAlthough the causes of injury responsible for death in chill susceptible insects are not \nfull understood (Ko\u0161t\u00e1l et al. 2004, see Chown and Terblanche (2007) for a review of \nchill injury), insights have been gained from thermal cycling experiments where the \ncumulative effects of exposure to low temperatures are repaired during short recovery \nperiods at a higher temperature (Chen and Denlinger 1992; Ko\u0161t\u00e1l et al. 2007). Ko\u0161t\u00e1l  \net al. (2007) found increased concentrations of potassium ions in extracellular fluids \nof Pyrrhocoris apterus exposed to constant low temperature  (-5\u00b0C) suggesting a \nfailure in the function of an active metabolic component (ion pump), which can result \nin dissipation of trans-membrane ion balance (Overgaard et al. 2007). Fluctuating \ntemperature regimes (FTRs) can also trigger the initiation of a metabolic response \ninvolving the synthesis of free amino acids (FAAs). Levels of essential amino acids \n(Lys, Iso, Leu, Phe and Trp) are known to be significantly higher in the tropical \nbeetle, A. diaperinus treated at 0\u00b0C compared to those at 20\u00b0C (Lalouette et al. 2007).  \nSome FAAs have been shown to have cryo-protective properties.  \n \nThe molecular mechanisms behind recovery from cold shock are alluded to in the \nprevious section and it certainly seems from the limited evidence so far that more \ngenes\/proteins are activated in the recovery phases when compared to the actual \nperiod of the cold shock itself. Of the studies to date, 10 genes were identified using \n 29\nCold insect review \nsubtractive techniques (Ellers et al. 2008) and 16 proteins in A. colemani after a \nfluctuating temperature regime (Colinet et al. 2007) (Table 4). The microarray \nanalysis of Qin et al. (2005), chose experimental conditions that avoided the \npossibility of accidentally detecting genes involved in recovery. Targeted gene \nanalysis of Hsp70 and Frost showed association with recovery from cold stress (Goto, \n2001; Rinehart et al, 2006a; Sinclair et al. 2007). Interestingly, desaturase 2, a gene \nimplicated in the alteration of membrane lipid content in response to cold (Kayukawa \net al. 2007), was unaltered in expression levels, even during recovery (Sinclair et al. \n2007), when, given its presumed function, one would have expected a down \nregulation as cellular membrane composition was changed back to \u201cnormal\u201d.  \n \nOf the genes involved in recovery, there are Hsps, membrane associated proteins and \naltered energy and metabolic pathways (Rinehart et al, 2006a; Colinet et al. 2007; \nSinclair et al. 2007; Ellers et al. 2008). The results are consistent with a ramping up of \nenergy production during favourable environmental periods to produce energy for \nessential physiological processes. So, for example genes such as Aldolase, \nglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoglycerate kinase, all \ncomponents of the glycolytic pathway were found to be up-regulated in the wasp, \nalong with an ATP-synthase subunit, involved in buffering ATP levels and a receptor \nof protein kinase C (RACK), involved in protein synthesis, cell division and signal \ntransduction (Colinet et al. 2007). This shift in energy metabolism and requirements \nwas also identified in Orchesella cincta (Ellers et al. 2008). In addition cytoskeletal \ncomponents were up-regulated and these have previously been implicated as being \nimportant in cold survival (Bilgen et al. 2001; Kim et al. 2006; Colinet et al. 2007).  \nSo, even now with limited evidence, there are several pathways identified which play \n 30\nCold insect review \nsignificant roles in recovery from cold shock and certain components, such as the \ncytoskeleton and lipid membranes, the manipulation of which are essential for cold \nsurvival.  \n  \nConclusions: the future \nWith the application of mass screening techniques (microarrays and 2-D gel \nelectrophoresis, as described here) and the evaluation of both lab-based and \nenvironmental data, insect physiologists are gradually unlocking the clues to the \nbiochemical mechanisms behind insect cold tolerance. Drosophila, despite its \nlimitations as a model organism in cold tolerance studies, will remain an experimental \nfavourite. It also has the advantage of a fully sequenced genome, well-characterised \nbreeding lines, mutants and cell lines. Therefore it is possible to use this organism to \nconduct more traditional genetic studies to identify areas of the genome with \nassociations to thermotolerance (Rako et al. 2007) and chill coma recovery (Norry et \nal. 2007). This will facilitate the identification of candidate genes for these traits, \nwhich if characterised can be identified and functionally evaluated in other insect \nspecies. However, it is still possible to identify areas of research, which with minimal \neffort should be promoted to advance research in non-model insect species and also \nareas where ecologically relevant insect species have significant contributions to \nmake, over and above those provided by model species: \n  \nWith the number of insect genomes completed to draft standard being increased, \nalongside numerous EST projects, genomic resources for the insect community are \ngrowing. This effectively means that it will become increasingly easy to identify \ngenes and proteins isolated by these various techniques and there will be fewer \n 31\nCold insect review \nrestrictions imposed on those working on non-model genomes. However, such studies \nshould be community driven with at least pilot studies in a number of relatively \nclosely related ecologically relevant species (i.e. not necessarily Drosophila or \nAnopheles). This will enable us to determine not only how closely related some of the \ninsects are, but also scope future co-operations for the sharing of resources, such as \nmicroarrays and gene primers\/data for targeted gene studies and Q-PCR. Such studies \nare ultimately synergistic and provide added value in a field where resources can be \nlimited.  \n \nWithin such studies, it should also be remembered in our technology driven era that \ngenomics cannot provide all the answers. It is essential to maintain such investigations \nwithin multidisciplinary teams, particularly with ecologists and physiologists who can \nprovide the context in which to place the molecular results. That is not to say that \nemerging techniques such as metabolomics (the \u201cnew\u201d biochemistry) and proteomics \nshould not be exploited, as ultimately the applied aim is to identify changes associated \nwith cold tolerance and proteins and biochemical compounds are the last stage in \nexpression analyses (Michaud and Denlinger, 2007). As regards triggers of response \nto low temperature, the answers will not lie in the gene products themselves, but in \ntranscription factors and signalling molecules (such as p38-MAPK) (Fujiwara et al. \n2006; Kidokoro et al. 2006; Fujiwara and Denlinger, 2007), an area which is largely \nunexplored in non-model insects to date. \n \n Finally although, the mechanisms of cold tolerance are interesting their own right per \nse, there is definitely future value in combining such studies with those on genome \nplasticity and evolution. How insects will potentially react and adapt in the face of \n 32\nCold insect review \nclimate change is a major challenge in future predictions of biodiversity. Examples of \ninsect alien invasion have already been documented and are a major concern for the \nfuture, particularly in areas such as the poles (Sinclair and Stevens, 2006; Frenot et al. \n2005) where the numbers of endemics are limited and could easily be replaced by \naggressive invasive species. \n \nSo, by applying a number of different approaches and using a range of species with a \ncomparative approach, the answers as to how insects survive the cold will become \napparent. This is certainly an area of research with great promise for the future with \nrelevance in many different fields of science.  \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis paper was produced within the BAS BIOREACH\/BIOFLAME core programmes \nand also contributes to the SCAR EBA programme.
