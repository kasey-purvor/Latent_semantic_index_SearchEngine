Observations were carried out simultaneously with the Proportional Counter Array (PCA) on board the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer satellite ( RXTE), the Robotic Optical Transient Search Experiment (ROTSE) and the Nancay decimetric radiotelescope (NRT). Intra-night variability is seen in the VHE band, the source being detected with a high significance on each night it was observed. Variability is also found in the X-ray and optical bands on kilosecond timescales, along with flux-dependent spectral changes in the X-rays. A transient X-ray event with a 1500 s timescale is detected, making this the fastest X-ray flare seen in this object. No correlation can be established between the X-ray and the gamma-ray fluxes, or any of the other wavebands, over the small range of observed variability. The average HESS spectrum shows a very soft power law shape with a photon index of 3.37 +\/- 0.07(stat) +\/- 0.10(sys). The energy outputs in the 2 - 10 keV and in the VHE gamma-ray range are found to be similar, with the X-rays and the optical fluxes at a level comparable to some of the lowest historical measurements, indicating that PKS 2155- 304 was in a low or quiescent state during the observations. Both a leptonic and a hadronic model are used to derive source parameters from these observations. These parameters are found to be sensitive to the model of Extragalactic Background Light (EBL) that attenuates the VHE signal at this source's redshift (z = 0.117). \\u","downloadUrl":"https:\/\/core.ac.uk\/download\/pdf\/66432.pdf","fullTextIdentifier":"http:\/\/dro.dur.ac.uk\/1505\/1\/1505.pdf","pdfHashValue":"67edd6912e5225c182ab1a0d051eb79b8818f928","publisher":"EDP Sciences","rawRecordXml":"<record><header><identifier>\n  \n    \n      oai:dro.dur.ac.uk.OAI2:1505<\/identifier><datestamp>\n      2017-03-09T16:40:31Z<\/datestamp><\/header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:oai_dc=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/\" xmlns:dc=\"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/ http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc.xsd\" ><dc:title>\n    \n      \n        Multi-wavelength observations of PKS 2155-304 with HESS.<\/dc:title><dc:creator>\n        Aharonian, F.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\n        Akhperjanian, A.

Observations were carried out\nsimultaneously with the Proportional Counter Array (PCA) on board the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer satellite (RXTE), the Robotic Optical\nTransient Search Experiment (ROTSE) and the Nan\u00e7ay decimetric radiotelescope (NRT). Intra-night variability is seen in the VHE band, the\nsource being detected with a high significance on each night it was observed. Variability is also found in the X-ray and optical bands on\nkilosecond timescales, along with flux-dependent spectral changes in the X-rays. A transient X-ray event with a 1500 s timescale is detected,\nmaking this the fastest X-ray flare seen in this object. No correlation can be established between the X-ray and the \u03b3-ray fluxes, or any of the\nother wavebands, over the small range of observed variability. The average HESS spectrum shows a very soft power law shape with a photon\nindex of 3.37 \u00b1 0.07stat \u00b1 0.10sys. The energy outputs in the 2\u201310 keV and in the VHE \u03b3-ray range are found to be similar, with the X-rays\nand the optical fluxes at a level comparable to some of the lowest historical measurements, indicating that PKS 2155\u2212304 was in a low or\nquiescent state during the observations. Both a leptonic and a hadronic model are used to derive source parameters from these observations.\nThese parameters are found to be sensitive to the model of Extragalactic Background Light (EBL) that attenuates the VHE signal at this source\u2019s\nredshift (z = 0.117).\nKey words. galaxies: active \u2013 gamma rays: observations \u2013 X-rays: galaxies \u2013 radiation mechanisms: non thermal\n\u0001 UMR 7164 (CNRS, Universit\u00e9 Paris VII, CEA, Observatoire de\nParis).\nArticle published by EDP Sciences and available at http:\/\/www.edpsciences.org\/aa or http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1051\/0004-6361:20053353\n896 F. Aharonian et al.: Multi-wavelength observations of PKS 2155-304 with HESS\n1. Introduction\nThe innermost regions of active galactic nuclei, where the\nlargest part of their luminosity is emitted, can be probed\nthrough observations of their flux variability at different wave-\nlengths. The physical processes in their central engines and\njets are usually considered the main candidates for the origin\nof the observed variability. Measurements of correlated vari-\nability, spectral variations and time lags across the broad-band\nobservations allow modelling of particle distributions and their\nradiation processes, as well as probing the acceleration mecha-\nnisms that are involved.\nPKS 2155\u2212304 is probably the most prominent and best-\nstudied blazar-type Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the\nSouthern Hemisphere. The emission of PKS 2155\u2212304, its\npossible variability patterns, as well as correlations across\nall wavebands, have been studied exhaustively over the\npast 20 years (see e.g. Urry et al. 1997). Its first detec-\ntion at VHE \u03b3-rays by the Durham Mk VI telescopes\n(Chadwick et al. 1999) classified it as a TeV blazar, like the\nnorthern hemisphere BL Lac objects Mkn 421, Mkn 501,\nH 1426+428, or 1ES 1959+650. Its redshift of z = 0.117\nmakes it the second most distant confirmed TeV blazar\nafter H 1426+428 (z = 0.129). PKS 2155\u2212304 was\nthe brightest BL Lac object in the EUVE all-sky survey\n(Marshall et al. 1995). This source was confirmed as a high\nenergy \u03b3-ray emitter by HESS (Aharonian et al. 2005, AH04\nhereafter) at the 45\u03c3 significance level, when strong detections\nwere reported for each of the dark periods of observations.\nHere we report on simultaneous HESS VHE \u03b3-ray,\nRXTE\/PCA X-ray, ROTSE optical, and NRT decimetric\nobservations of PKS 2155\u2212304 during the dark periods\nof October and November 2003. No simultaneous multi-\nwavelength campaign had before included an Atmospheric\nCherenkov Telescope (ACT) that could sample the evolution\nof the high energy component of the spectral energy distri-\nbution (SED) of this object. We also include EGRET archival\ndata, and other archival radio through X-ray data obtained from\nthe NASA\/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED). Details of the\nobservations and data reduction\/analysis are given in Sect. 2.\nLight curves and spectra are described in Sect. 3. The attenua-\ntion of the HESS spectrum by the EBL and an interpretation of\nthe data using a leptonic and a hadronic model are discussed in\nSect. 4.\n2. Observations and data analysis\n2.1. HESS\n2.1.1. HESS detector\nIn its first phase, the HESS array consists of four atmo-\nspheric Cherenkov telescopes operating in stereoscopic mode.\nHowever, the data shown here were taken during the construc-\ntion of the system, initially with two telescopes, with one more\nas of mid-September, 2003. The fourth and final telescope was\nadded to the array in December 2003, subsequent to the data\npresented here. Each telescope has a tessellated 13 m-diameter\n(107 m2 surface area) mirror which focuses the Cherenkov light\nfrom the showers of secondary particles created by the inter-\naction of \u03b3-rays in the atmosphere onto a camera in the fo-\ncal plane. This camera consists of 960 photomultipliers, each\nwith a pixel size of 0.16\u25e6, giving a field of view of 5\u25e6. For the\ndata sets presented here the \u03b3-ray trigger threshold is \u2248100 GeV\nand the spectral threshold is 160 GeV with an energy resolution\n\u000515%. The experiment is located in the Khomas highlands in\nNamibia, (23\u25e6 S, 15\u25e6 E, 1800 m a.s.l.). A detailed description\nof the layout and the components of the telescope optical sys-\ntems, including the segmented mirror with its support struc-\nture, the mirror facets for each telescope and the Winston cone\nlight concentrators in front of the PMT camera can be found\nin Bernl\u00f6hr et al. (2003), and a description of the mirror align-\nment is given in Cornils et al. (2003). For details on the cam-\nera calibration see Aharonian et al. (2004a). The trigger system\nis described in Funk et al. (2004). Early reports of HESS have\nbeen given elsewhere (see e.g. Hofmann 2002).\n2.1.2. Observations\nIn the beginning of the observation period of October 2003,\na single 5\u03c3 detection by HESS achieved in 1 h, triggered an\napproved RXTE ToO (Target of Opportunity) on this target.\nThe results presented here are based on observations carried\nout in 2003 between October 19 and November 26.\nThe data were taken in the Wobble mode where the source\ndirection is positioned \u00b10.5\u25e6 in declination relative to the cen-\ntre of the field of view of the camera during observations. This\nallows for both on-source observations and simultaneous esti-\nmation of the background induced by charged cosmic rays. The\ndata reported here are selected and analyzed with the \u201cstandard\nanalysis\u201d described in Sect. 4 of AH04. The background is es-\ntimated here by using all events passing cuts in a ring around\nthe source, as described in Sect. 4.3 in AH04. The runs pass-\ning the quality selection criteria total 32.4 h of livetime on\nthe source. The total two-dimensional significance sky map is\nshown in Fig. 1, along with a graph showing the \u03b82 distribu-\ntion (where \u03b82 is the square of the angular difference between\nthe reconstructed shower position and the source position) of\nthe 1764 excess events observed. This yields a detection at the\n34.3\u03c3 level, at the average rate of 0.91\u03b3\/min and a significance\nof 6.0\u03c3\/\n\u221a\nh.\nThe methods used here for reconstructing the energy of\neach event and for determining a spectrum are described in\nSect. 6 of AH04. The measured time-average spectrum is fitted\nby a power law of the form dN\/dE = I0(E\/1 TeV)\u2212\u0393 with I0 the\nflux normalization at 1 TeV and \u0393 the photon index. The photon\nindex obtained from the time-averaged spectrum is then used as\na fixed parameter to estimate the integral flux above 300 GeV\nfor each run. This integrated flux takes into account the effec-\ntive area and threshold variations due to the source moving\nthrough the sky, giving more reliable variability information\nthan counting rates in units of \u03b3-rays\/min. Overall systematic\nerrors are estimated to be 20% for the integral flux and \u00050.1 for\nthe photon index.\nF.

RXTE\nThe PCA (Jahoda et al. 1996) units of RXTE observed\nPKS 2155\u2212304 between October 22 and November 23 of\n2003 with exposures of typically 10 ks in October and \u00051 ks\nin November. The STANDARD2 data were extracted using\nthe ftools in the HEASOFT 5.3.1 analysis software package\nprovided by NASA\/GSFC and filtered using the RXTE Guest\nObserver Facility (GOF) recommended criteria. The changing\nProportional Counter Units (PCU0\/2\/3) configuration through-\nout the observations was taken into account in the data reduc-\ntion, and only the signals from the top layer (X1L and X1R)\nwere used. When reducing the PCUs individually to estab-\nlish the time-averaged spectrum, the average spectral fit pa-\nrameters are similar within error bars but with a systemati-\ncally higher \u03c72 for spectral fits performed on PCU0 data alone.\nOn shorter timescales this effect becomes negligible and PCU0\ncontributes to the statistical significance of the flux measure-\nment. Therefore all PCUs were kept for the overall light curve\nwhich is binned in 400 s bins, but only PCU2 and PCU3 are\nused for the analysis of data segments that are simultaneous\nwith HESS runs and for the time-averaged spectrum.\nThe average spectrum used in the SED is derived by\ncombining PCU2 and PCU3 spectra using the addspec tool\nweighted by the counts information delivered by fstatistic\nand then the corresponding response matrices were combined\nwith addrmf. The faint-background model was used and only\nthe 3\u201340 PHA channel range was kept in XSPEC v. 11.3.1,\nor approximately 2\u201320 keV.\nTo build a light curve in units of integrated flux in the\n2\u201310 keV band, spectral data were derived from 400 s bins\nto probe short timescales with adequate statistical accuracy.\nThese segments are then fitted by a power law in XSPEC\nwith PCU configuration-dependent response matrices gener-\nated by the ftool pcarsp v. 10.1 and a fixed column den-\nsity of NH = 1.7 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 obtained from PIMMS1. This\nyields the flux and the error (corresponding to the 1\u03c3 confi-\ndence level) on the flux reported in the light curves in Fig. 2, in\nunits of 10\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 in the 2\u201310 keV band. The fits did\nnot improve by using a broken power-law for the 400 s binned\nobservations.\n2.3. ROTSE\nThe ROTSE-III array is a worldwide network of four 0.45 m\nrobotic, automated telescopes built for fast (\u22486 s) response to\nGRB triggers from satellites such as HETE-2 (High Energy\nTransient Explorer 2) and Swift. The ROTSE-III telescopes\nhave a wide (1.85\u25e6\u00d71.85\u25e6) field of view imaged onto a Marconi\n2048 \u00d7 2048 pixel back-illuminated thinned CCD and are op-\nerated without filters. The ROTSE-III systems are described\nin detail in Akerlof et al. (2003). At the time of the observa-\ntions of PKS 2155\u2212304 in October and November 2003, two\nROTSE-III telescopes were operational in the Southern hemi-\nsphere: ROTSE-IIIa located at the Siding Spring Observatory,\nAustralia and ROTSE-IIIc at the HESS site. The ROTSE-IIIc\ntelescope is located in the centre of the HESS telescope array.\nA 30% share of the total observation time is available to the\nHESS collaboration, which has been used to perform an auto-\nmated monitoring programme of blazars, including objects that\nare being observed with the HESS telescopes. Both telescopes\nparticipated in the observation campaign on PKS 2155\u2212304 in\nOctober and November 2003.\nThe telescopes observed PKS 2155\u2212304 typically 10 times\nper night taking sequences of 2 frames with 60 s exposures with\na slight dithering of the pointing to reduce the impact of indi-\nvidual noisy pixels. The typical limiting magnitude, depending\non the sky conditions, is 18.5mag. Overall, 323 bias-subtracted\nand flat-fielded frames have passed visual inspection and are\nused to produce a light curve. A total of 6 frames were rejected\ndue to the presence of stray light from Jupiter.\n1 See http:\/\/legacy.gsfc.nasa.gov\/Tools\/w3pimms.html\n898 F.

Bottom: same as above but for the November 2003 data. Note that the RXTE observations were much shorter than in the previous month.\nUsing an overlay of 50 isolated comparison stars\nwith similar brightness (12mag\u221214mag) and co-located with\nPKS 2155\u2212304 (<15 arcmin), a two-dimensional Gaussian is\nfit to the intensity distribution characterising the point-spread\nfunction by \u03c3psf .\nTo estimate the local sky-background for the reference stars\nand the target object, an annulus with inner radius 2 \u00d7 \u03c3psf and\nan outer radius 6\u00d7\u03c3psf is chosen. Based upon a reference frame\nwhich is derived from co-adding 30 individual frames, a mask\nis calculated for each object excluding regions where faint ob-\njects coincide with the annulus; pixels exceeding 3 standard\ndeviations of the local sky background are excluded. Using the\nlocal sky background, the intensity and error of each object is\ncalculated. Using the 50 reference stars, a relative intensity and\nstatistical error with respect to a reference frame is calculated.\nThe absolute flux values are obtained by calculating a rel-\native R magnitude by comparing the instrumental magnitude\nwith the USNO catalogue as described in Akerlof et al. (2000).\nThe procedure has been checked by comparing the average\nR magnitude of a sample of 70 BL Lac type objects determined\nwith ROTSE observations carried out over one year of oper-\nation with the V magnitude listed in the 10th Veron Cetty &\nVeron catalogue of BL Lac type objects. The average V \u2212 R\nof 0.5 that is found is consistent with the average value for V\u2212R\nobtained from cross-checking the colours with the 2MASS cat-\nalogued value for the BL Lac type objects.\nFinally, the host galaxy has been resolved in optical\n(Falomo 1996) and NIR (Kotilainen et al. 1998, KFS98 here-\nafter) and found to be a typical giant elliptical with M(R) =\n\u221224.4 which translates into an apparent m(R) = 15.1 (here\nthe distance moduli given by KFS98 have been used to cal-\nculate the apparent magnitude based upon the absolute mag-\nnitude quoted). The ROTSE measurements have as maximum\nand minimum m(R,min) = 13.3 and m(R,max) = 13.7 which\ncorresponds to 10 mJy for the maximum observed flux and\n6.7 mJy for the minimum flux taking the contribution of the\nhost galaxy into account. These values are considerably lower\nthan the retrieved archival data indicating that PKS 2155\u2212304\nwas in a low state at the moment of the observations.\nF. Aharonian et al.: Multi-wavelength observations of PKS 2155-304 with HESS 899\n2.4. NRT\nThe Nan\u00e7ay radiotelescope is a single-dish antenna with a col-\nlecting area of 200 \u00d7 34.56 m2 equivalent to that of a 94 m-\ndiameter parabolic dish (van Driel et al. 1996). The half-power\nbeam width at 11 cm is 1.9 arcmin (EW)\u00d7 11.5 arcmin (NS) (at\nzero declination), and the system temperature is about 45 K\nin both horizontal and vertical polarizations. The point source\nefficiency is 0.8 K Jy\u22121, and the chosen filter bandwidth was\n12.5 MHz for each polarization, split into two sub-bands of\n6.25 MHz each. Between 4 and 14 individual 1-min drift scans\nwere performed for each observation, and the flux was cali-\nbrated using a calibrated noise diode emission for each drift\nscan. Data processing has been done with the Nan\u00e7ay local\nsoftware NAPS and SIR.\nA monitoring programme with this telescope on extragalac-\ntic sources visible by both the NRT and HESS is in place\nsince 2001. For the campaign described here it consisted of\na measurement at 11 cm every two or three days. The average\nflux for the 8 measurements in October and November 2003\nwas 0.30 \u00b1 0.01 Jy with possible marginal variability.\n3. Results\n3.1. Light curves\nThe October and November 2003 light curves of all the HESS,\nRXTE and ROTSE observations are shown in Fig. 2. The HESS\nlight curve is binned in run-length times averaging 28 min\neach. The flux is in units of 10\u221211 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 above\n300 GeV, derived using the average photon index 3.37 obtained\nin Sect. 3.3. Spectra could not be derived on a run-by-run ba-\nsis due to the weak signal. As for the observations reported in\nAH04, the overall light curve is inconsistent with a constant\nflux. A \u03c72 fit of the data to a constant yields a 3.4 \u00d7 10\u221210 \u03c72\nprobablility. The intra-night VHE flux on MJD 52 936 (Fig. 3)\nexhibits an increase of a factor of 1.9 \u00b1 0.6 in 0.11 d. On\nMJD 52 932 the peak-to-peak flux shows an increase of a factor\nof 2.5\u00b1 0.9 within 0.09 d. These timescales are longer than the\n30 min doubling time reported in AH04. For these two extreme\ncases of VHE variability observed during this campaign only\nthe second had a limited RXTE coverage.\nThe 2\u201310 keV X-ray flux in this campaign ranges from\nF2\u221210 keV = 2.0\u00d710\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 to 4.4\u00d710\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121.\nThe maximum is lower than the 20 November 1997 measure-\nment of 2.3\u00d7 10\u221210 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 (Vestrand & Sreekumar 1999)\nindicating that the X-ray state seen here is not exceptionally\nhigh. The minimum seen here is consistent with historically\nlow fluxes (Zhang et al. 2002).

Indeed, the derived in-\ndex is close to those measured by the BeppoSAX satellite\n(Giommi et al. 1998), GINGA (Sembay et al. 1993) and well\nwithin the range observed by EXOSAT (Treves et al. 1989).\nThe statistics above 10 keV in our RXTE observations are too\npoor to check the existence of a possible hard tail above 20 keV\n(Giommi et al. 1998) which might be the signature of the onset\nof a high-energy component.\nIn order to look for flux dependent spectral variability, the\nRXTE data subset used in Fig. 3 is divided into two energy\nbands, the PHA channels 0\u20139 (soft band) and 10\u201327 (hard\nband), corresponding to approximately 1\u20134 keV and 4\u201311 keV,\nrespectively. A hardness ratio (HR), shown in Fig. 7, is the ratio\nof the counting rate in the hard band over the soft band. There\nis a clear correlation of the HR with the rate, peaking when the\nrate is highest. The correlation factor between the rate and the\nHR is r = 0.76 \u00b1 0.12. Even though the variability timescale\nhere is much smaller, this behavior is compatible with the hard-\nening reported in Chiappetti et al. (1999).\n3.4. EBL corrected spectrum\nFor objects at non-negligible redshifts, the large, energy-\ndependent opacities can cause the emitted spectrum to\nbe greatly modified both in shape and intensity (see\ne.g. Stecker et al. 1992; Biller 1995; Coppi & Aharonian 1999;\nVassiliev 2000). Unfortunately, at present the knowledge of the\nEBL still has large uncertainties, for both direct measurements\nand models, as summarized in Primack et al. (2001). In order\nto estimate the intrinsic VHE spectrum, and thus to locate the\nInverse Compton (IC) peak of the blazar\u2019s SED, we have used\nFig. 8. Spectral energy distribution of the Extragalactic Background\nLight (EBL). It is thought to be characterized by two dis-\ntinct bumps, around 1\u20132 and 100\u2013200 \u00b5m, produced by the red-\nshifted stellar light and re-radiated thermal dust emission, respec-\ntively. The compilation of measurements have been taken from\nHauser & Dwek (2001) and Aharonian et al. (2003). Lower limits\nare from HST and ISO source counts (Madau & Pozzetti 2000;\nElbaz et al. 2002; Gardner et al. 2000). Above 400 \u00b5m, the contribu-\ntion of the CMB starts to dominate. The three continuous lines repre-\nsent the \u201cPrimack-type\u201d EBL shapes: from higher to lower fluxes (at\n1\u00b5m), Phigh, Primack01 and Primack04 models (see text). The steep\nline starting at 300 \u00b5m is the onset of the CMBR.\nthree EBL models (Fig. 8) as representatives of three different\nflux levels for the stellar peak component. This is the EBL en-\nergy range which mostly affects the HESS spectrum: with data\nup to 3\u20133.5 TeV, the peak of the \u03b3 \u2212 \u03b3 cross section is reached\nfor soft photons with wavelengths \u00015 \u00b5m.\nThe three models used here are (in order from higher\nto lower fluxes): the phenomenological shape used in\nAharonian et al. (2003), which is based on the original\nPrimack et al. (2001) calculation but smoothed and scaled up\nto match the data points below 1 \u00b5m and at 2\u20133.5 \u00b5m (here-\nafter Phigh); the original Primack et al. (2001) calculation\nfor a Salpeter initial mass function (hereafter Primack01);\nand the new 2004 calculation (Primack et al. 2004, hereafter\nPrimack04), which takes advantage of the recent improvements\nin the knowledge of the cosmological parameters and of the lo-\ncal luminosity function of galaxies.\nThe opacities are calculated from the EBL SED shapes tak-\ning into account only the cosmology (H0 = 70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121,\n\u2126Mat = 0.3 and \u2126\u039b = 0.7). To treat all three shapes simi-\nlarly, no evolution has been introduced at this point. This cor-\nresponds to a \u201cmaximum absorption\u201d hypothesis (i.e., for in-\ncreasing z, constant instead of decreasing EBL comoving en-\nergy density). But at these redshifts (\u223c0.1) and, for example,\nassuming the evolution given in Primack et al. (2001), the dif-\nference is still small (variation in the photon index \u2206\u0393 < 0.1\nin the range 0.3\u20131 TeV), and negligible compared to the differ-\nences between models.\nThe resulting absorption-corrected spectra are shown in\nFig. 9, together with the observed spectrum. The intrinsic spec-\ntra are all well fitted by a single power-law model, with a hard\n902 F. Aharonian et al.: Multi-wavelength observations of PKS 2155-304 with HESS\nFig. 9. PKS 2155\u2212304 absorption-corrected spectra, along with the\nobserved spectrum, for each EBL model considered and in a \u03bdF\u03bd plot\n(i.e. a zoom in the blazar\u2019s SED). Open dots: HESS observed spec-\ntrum. Filled dots: reconstructed intrinsic spectrum. All spectra from\n\u201cPrimack-type\u201d models are compatible with a power-law shape, with\ndifferent slopes: hard (Phigh) and soft (Primack01, Primack04), locat-\ning the intrinsic SED peak for the high component above 1\u20132 TeV or\nbelow 200 GeV, respectively.\nspectrum for Phigh (\u0393 \u2248 1.5), and soft spectra for Primack01\nand Primack04 models (\u0393 \u2248 2.3 and \u0393 \u2248 2.8, respectively).\nThis effect is directly related to the different flux levels of\nthe stellar peak component, which imprint a different amount\nof softening onto the original spectrum. This direct link thus\nyields two simple scenarios for the location of the blazar\u2019s high\nenergy peak, with the dividing line represented by the EBL flux\nwhich gives \u0393 = 2.0 (1.3 times the Primack01 model). Models\nwith stellar peak fluxes above this (such as Phigh, and generally\nall those in agreement with the direct estimates of the fluxes be-\ntween 2 and 3.5 \u00b5m) imply a hard intrinsic spectrum (\u0393 < 2),\nand thus an IC peak above 1\u20132 TeV. EBL models with lower\nfluxes (such as the Primack01 and Primack04) imply instead\na soft spectrum (\u0393 > 2), locating the IC peak below the ob-\nserved energy range (<200 GeV). In the following, we will dis-\ncuss both scenarios for the SED modelling, using the Phigh and\nPrimack2004 curves as the two ends of the possible range of\nvalues for the \u201cPrimack-type\u201d shape (i.e., between the claimed\nEBL direct measurements at few microns and the lower limits\nfrom galaxy counts).\n4. SED modelling\nThe broadband spectral morphology of PKS 2155\u2212304 is\ntypical of the BL Lac type, with a double-humped struc-\nture in \u03bdF\u03bd representation, exhibiting a low-energy and a\nhigh-energy component. Its broadband emission is usually at-\ntributed to emission from a beamed relativistic jet, oriented\nin a direction close to the line of sight (Begelman et al. 1984;\nBlandford & K\u00f6nigl 1979). The spectral energy distribution in\nunits of power per logarithmic bandwidth E2dN\/dE versus en-\nergy E is shown in Fig. 10. The EGRET measurements, be-\ntween the HESS and RXTE points, are from the third EGRET\ncatalog (Hartman 1999) and from a very high \u03b3-ray state de-\nscribed in Vestrand et al. (1995). There is a difference in spec-\ntral states, since in the former case the power law photon index\nis 1.71\u00b1 0.24 whereas it is 2.34\u00b1 0.26 in the latter which most\nlikely consists of a mix of low and high activity state obser-\nvations. The historical EGRET spectra are therefore unlikely\nto represent the state of PKS 2155\u2212304 during the campaign\npresented here and are not used to put stringent constraints\non the modelling. Considering the archival data and the steep\nX-ray spectrum in Fig. 10, the peak of the low-energy compo-\nnent occurs in the 2\u20132000 eV range. The archival BeppoSAX\ndata from a high state analyzed by Chiappetti et al. (1999),\nand represented here above our RXTE data, show a peak at\n\u22480.1 keV. The absorbed VHE peak location is clearly below\n300 GeV, with its exact location depending on the spectrum in\nthe EGRET range.\nWhereas the current models seem to agree that the low-\nenergy component is dominated by synchrotron radiation com-\ning from nonthermal electrons emitted in collimated jets,\nthe high-energy emission is assumed to be either inverse\nCompton scattering off the synchrotron photons (Synchrotron\nSelf-Compton, SSC, see e.g. Maraschi et al. 1999; Bicknell\n& Wagner 2002) or by external photons (see e.g. Sikora\net al. 1994). This kind of leptonic model will be discussed\nin Sect. 4.2. A hadronic origin of the VHE emission using\nthe Synchrotron-Proton Blazar (SPB) model with a dominat-\ning proton synchrotron component at high energies in a proton-\nelectron plasma is also able to produce a double humped SED\nand is discussed in Sect. 4.3. The lack of correlation between\nthe RXTE and HESS fluxes (and possibly also between the op-\ntical and the VHE emission) within the small variability range\nmay indicate a different spatial origin, or a different underlying\nparticle distribution. In the proton synchrotron model a lack\nof correlated variability between \u03b3-ray emission and the low\nenergy electron synchrotron component could arise if the elec-\ntrons and protons are not co-accelerated.\nThe high-energy component above \u2248100 GeV is attenuated\nby interactions with the EBL and is a lower limit for the intrin-\nsic spectrum. The energy budget in X-rays and VHE \u03b3-rays\nis comparable, though the maximum output at the peak en-\nergy in the high-energy component is likely to be lower than\nthat in the lower-energy component. Interpolating between the\nhigh-state EGRET archival data and VHE data would lead to a\nmaximum located above 10 GeV, which is surprising since the\nobservations reported here indicate a low state. Extrapolating\nthe EGRET catalogue spectrum to VHE energies with a power\nlaw falls below the HESS data and therefore requires two in-\nflexion points in the SED. Simultaneous observations in the\nMeV\u2013GeV range with the upcoming satellite GLAST will be\ncrucial to constrain the high-energy component shape.\n4.1. Doppler boosting and synchrotron\/Compton\nderived parameters\nThe electromagnetic emission in blazars is very likely to\nbe Doppler-boosted (or beamed) toward the observer. In\nthe radio regime, the evidence for Doppler boosting in\nPKS 2155\u2212304 comes from superluminal expansions observed\nwith VLBI (Piner & Edwards 2004). Relativistic beaming is\nalso required in order to avoid absorption of GeV photons by\nF.

The two triangles are the highest and lowest ROTSE\nmeasurements for the Oct.\u2013Nov. observations. Archival SAX data represent the high state observed in 1997 from Chiappetti et al. (1999).\nArchival EGRET data are from the third EGRET catalogue (shaded bowtie), Hartman (1999) and from a very high \u03b3-ray state described in\nVestrand et al. (1995) (open bowtie). 1995 UBVRI data are from Paltani et al. (1997) where the mean flux and flux deviation is used here. IUE\ndata from Urry et al. (1993) at 2800 \u00c5 and 1400 \u00c5 are included here with an error bar corresponding to the spread of the measured fluxes. Other\ndata are NED archival data. The solid line is the hadronic model described in Sect. 4.3. The dotted and dashed lines are the same leptonic model\nwith different assumptions described in Sect. 4.2: the dotted line assumes a common origin for the optical and X-ray synchrotron emission,\nwhile the dashed line is the case where the optical emission emanates from the VLBI core; for both cases the lowest frequency hump is the\npredicted VLBI core emission. All the VHE emission in the models are absorbed according to the Primack04 model discussed in Sect. 3.4.\nX-ray photons via the e+\/e\u2212 pair-production process (see e.g.\nMaraschi et al. 1992). It is thus possible to use the \u03b3-ray vari-\nability to establish a limit for the Doppler factor \u03b4, with \u03b4 de-\nfined in the standard way as [\u0393(1 \u2212 \u03b2 cos \u03b8)]\u22121, where \u0393 is the\nbulk Lorentz factor of the plasma in the jet, \u03b2 = v\/c, and \u03b8 is\nthe angle to the line of sight.\nFollowing Dondi & Ghisellini (1995), the size of the \u03b3-ray\nemission zone R is derived from the time-scale of variability\ntvar (supposing the timescale of intrinsic variability is negligible\ncompared to the light crossing time) by R \u2264 ctvar\u03b4\/(1 + z). In\nthis case (assuming a time scale tvar \u2248 2 ks from Sect. 3) the\nsize of the emission region is\nR\u03b4\u22121 \u2264 5 \u00d7 1013 cm. (2)\nSince for \u03b3-rays in the 300 GeV\u20133 TeV range the opacity\n\u03c4\u03b3\u03b3 cannot significantly exceed 1, independently of the emis-\nsion mechanisms, another constraint on the minimum value\nof the Doppler factor can be derived by estimating how much\nDoppler boosting is necessary for photons with observed en-\nergy E\u03b3 to escape from a source with radius R and a flux den-\nsity F(Et), where Et = (mec2)2\u03b42\/E\u03b3(1 + z)2. At this point\none can follow Mattox et al. (1993) and especially Eq. (3.7) in\nDondi & Ghisellini (1995), writing that the opacity is\n\u03c4\u03b3\u03b3 \u2248 \u03c3T5\n1\nhc\nd2L\nR\n1\n\u03b43(1 + z) F(Et). (3)\nImposing that \u03c4\u03b3\u03b3 < 1 for photons with observed energy E\u03b3 =\n1 TeV yields a lower limit on \u03b4 for given R that can be derived\nnumerically from the observed SED. For PKS 2155\u2212304 this\nyields\nR\u22121\u03b4\u22126.4 \u2264 5.6 \u00d7 10\u221224 cm\u22121. (4)\nThe minimum allowable boost \u03b4 comes from combining\nEqs. (2) and (4) and yields\n\u03b4 \u2265 19 (5)\nwhich is higher than the limit obtained in a similar way in\nTavecchio et al. (1998), but at the lower end of the range usu-\nally obtained from SSC modelling as in Kataoka et al. (2000).\nIt is useful to stress that this constraint is valid under the usual\nassumption that the region emitting the SED optical flux (i.e.,\nthe target photons) is cospatial with (or at least embeds) the\nhigh energy emitting region. The models used later in this pa-\nper are therefore essentially single zone models.\nIf the observed X-rays are synchrotron radiation from non-\nthermal electrons then the mean observed energy \u3008E\u3009 of an\nelectron with Lorentz factor \u03b3e is given by\n\u3008E\u3009 \u2248 \u03b4\n1 + z\n21\u0001\u03b32eqB\n15\n\u221a\n3me\n\u00b7\nUsing \u3008E\u3009 = 10 keV here yields\nB\u03b4\u03b32e = 1.1 \u00d7 1012 G.

(1996) who derived \u03b3e > 5 \u00d7 105 (and\nB \u2248 0.2 G) but lower than \u03b3e \u2248 107 found in a similar way\nin 1ES1959+650 (Giebels et al. 2002).\nThe X-ray data presented above imply that the X-ray spec-\ntrum of PKS 2155\u2212304 hardens as the source brightens. This\nis often measured in BL Lac objects; a hardening of the spec-\ntrum when flares occur, and a blueward shift of the peak of\nthe synchrotron emission \u03bdsync (and presumably higher energy\ninverse-Compton emission) by factors that can be as large as\n100 were measured in the cases of Mkn 501 (Pian et al. 1998),\n1ES 1426+428 and PKS 0548\u2212322 (Costamante et al. 2001).\nIn the case of PKS 2005\u2212489 (Perlman et al. 1999), a more\nmoderate shift of a factor of 3 or less of the synchrotron emis-\nsion was found. The archival data suggest that \u03bdsync lies in the\nUV band for PKS 2155\u2212304, but no data were taken simulta-\nneously in this campaign at that wavelength.\nThe lack of indication for correlated X-ray\/VHE variability\ndoes not imply that PKS 2155\u2212304 behaves differently from\nVHE sources such as Mkn 421, for which VHE\/X-ray corre-\nlation has been established on a much higher variability basis\n(see e.g. Cui et al. 2004) with dynamical ranges of 30 in both\nenergy bands. Limiting those observations to the same dynam-\nical range as observed here would not allow any claim for cor-\nrelation. Future observations of PKS 2155\u2212304 with a higher\nvariability amplitude would bring more insight into this.\n4.2. Leptonic interpretation\nInterpretation with a single zone SSC model of the SED\nof PKS 2155\u2212304 has already been proposed in the litera-\nture using two different assumptions. In Kataoka et al. (2000)\nthe low energy tail of the SSC model is used to account\nfor the low-energy component up to the optical in the SED.\nThat component is decomposed into two sub-components by\nChiappetti et al. (1999) where the radio to optical emission\nhas another origin than the X-rays, which are assumed to\ncome from the jet. These two different interpretations are\nused here in the context of the leptonic model described in\nKatarzyn\u00b4ski et al. (2001) which has already been applied to\nMkn 501 and Mkn 421 (Katarzyn\u00b4ski et al. 2003). To constrain\nthis model, only the simultaneous data are used, since the\narchival data reported in the SED of Fig. 10 are likely to not\nrepresent the state of this source (note for example the differ-\nence in optical flux and the ROTSE measurement).\nWhen using the Primack04 absorption, the model used here\ncan reproduce the X-ray through VHE part of the SED, but\nthe HESS spectrum constrains it such that the radio measure-\nment can not be included in the synchrotron bump predicted by\nthe single-zone model. As for Mkn 421 and Mkn 501, adding\na more extended component than the VHE emitting zone can\nprovide an explanation for this. The origin is probably the com-\npact VLBI core which has a radio core to lobe ratio of \u22481\n(Laurent-Muehleisen et al. 1993; Piner & Edwards 2004) and\na typical size of 1018 cm, more than two orders of magnitude\nlarger than the VHE emitting zone. This VLBI feature domi-\nnates the spectrum at low energy and is included in the SED\nmodelling here. An uncertainty remains which is the high fre-\nquency cutoff of this VLBI component. The host galaxy contri-\nbution to the optical flux is estimated to be \u224810\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121,\ndeduced from the magnitudes given by KFS98 and assum-\ning a low-redshift solar metallicity elliptical galaxy of age\nequal to 13 Gyr (R \u2212 H = 2.4), corresponding to a mass of\n5 \u00d7 1011 M\u000b (Fioc & Rocca-Volmerange 1997). So even at the\nmeasured low activity state of PKS 2155\u2212304 the host galaxy\nis not contributing much in the optical range.\nThe ROTSE measurement can be ascribed here to either the\nhigh-energy tail of the VLBI component or to the synchrotron\npart of the SSC model. Assuming a common origin for the\nX-rays and the optical emission, and using a variability time\nscale of 0.1 d to constrain the emitting zone, the model tends to\npredict a high IC flux, as shown in Fig. 10. However, the lack\nof correlation between the X-rays and the optical emission in\nour measurements \u2013 also suggested by Dominici et al. (2004)\nbased on less sensitive RXTE\/ASM measurements \u2013 indicates\nthat the optical emission could originate from the VLBI com-\nponent, which is modelled by a slight increase in the maximal\nLorentz factor of the emitting electrons. This in turn lessens the\nconstraint on the simultaneous SSC fit of the X-ray and VHE\npart and allows a better fit of the VHE spectrum for smaller\nsizes of the emitting zone. Detailed parameters of the two hy-\npotheses are given in Table 1.\nIf the absorption correction is well described by the Phigh\nmodel, the slope of HESS data at high energy implies that\nthe peak of the TeV emission bump is located above 4 TeV\n(or 1027 Hz). Such a high frequency peak emission imposes a\nstrong constraint for the single-zone SSC scenario, especially\nsince the peak of the synchrotron bump has to remain below\n1 keV (or 1017.5 Hz) as required by the slope of the RXTE data.\nHigh values of both the jet Doppler factor and the maximal\nLorentz factor of radiating particles are required to reach the\nnecessary energy for the IC bump, that is \u03b3max\u03b4 > 8 \u00d7 106.\nOn the other hand, to keep the synchrotron peak below 1 keV\nimposes an upper limit to the magnetic field. Within these con-\nstrains, the best fit we obtain is shown in Fig. 11. We can note\nthat none of the high energy tails are well accounted for. The\nset of parameters for the best fit is given in Table 1. This fit\nmarginally reproduces the observed X-ray and \u03b3-ray data, but\nis not as satisfactory than that obtained with the Primack04 ab-\nsorption correction, and in any case it is impossible to take into\naccount the ROTSE optical point. The main changes in param-\neters between the two fits consist in enhancing the boosting,\nF. Aharonian et al.: Multi-wavelength observations of PKS 2155-304 with HESS 905\nTable 1. Parameters for the SED fit with the assumption that the\noptical and X-ray emission are part of the jet synchrotron emission\n(Model 1 in the table, dotted line in Fig. 10) or that the optical emis-\nsion emanates from the VLBI emission zone (Model 2 in the table,\ndashed lines in the same figure).

As pointed out by Chiaberge et al. (2000) such\nhigh values are however at odds with attempts to unify\nthe BL Lac population with the family of FR I sources\n(Urry & Padovani 1995), the latter being possibly an unbeamed\nsince off-axis viewed case of the former. The same authors\nsuggest that models where velocity structures in the jet, such\nas the \u201cspine-sheath\u201d model (see e.g. Sol et al. 1989) or the\ndecelerating flow model (Georganopoulos & Kazanas 2003;\nGeorganopoulos & Kazanas 2004) allow lower bulk Lorentz\nfactors. Another option from Pelletier et al. (2004) is to cope\nwith the pair creation catastrophe implied by smaller Doppler\nfactors in their \u201ctwo-flow\u201d solution. Comparing the SED with\nsuch models, which make the BL Lac \u2013 FR-I connection more\nplausible, is an interesting task but beyond the scope of this\npaper.\n4.3. Hadronic models\nGenerally, the leptonic models constitute the preferred concept\nfor TeV blazars, essentially because of two attractive features:\n(i) the capability of the (relatively) well understood shocks to\naccelerate electrons to TeV energies (Sikora & Madejski 2001;\nPelletier 2001) and (ii) the effective conversion of the kinetic\nenergy of these relativistic electrons into the X-ray and VHE\n\u03b3-ray emission components through the synchrotron and\ninverse Compton radiation channels. The hadronic models are\ngenerally lack these virtues. They assume that the observed\n\u03b3-ray emission is initiated by accelerated protons interacting\nE (eV)\n1110 1210 1310\n \n] \n-\n1\n \ns\n-\n2\ndN\n\/d\nE \n[ e\nrg\n cm\n2 E\n-1210\n-1110\n-1010\n-910\nObserved spectrum\nUnabsorbed Primack04\nUnabsorbed Phigh\nFig. 11. Estimations of the intrinsic PKS 2155\u2212304 VHE spectrum,\ncorrected for either the Phigh or Primack04 models, along with the\nassociated intrinsic (i.e. before absorption) SSC model (dashed lines)\nand SPB model (solid lines).\nwith ambient matter (Bednarek 1993; Dar & Laor 1997;\nPohl & Schlickeiser 2000), photon fields (PIC model,\nMannheim 2000), magnetic fields (Aharonian et al. 2002)\nor both (M\u00fccke & Protheroe 2000).\nThe models of TeV blazars involving interactions of pro-\ntons with photon and B-fields require particle acceleration to\nextreme energies exceeding 1019 eV which is possible if the\nacceleration time is close to tacc = rg\/c (rg is the gyro-radius).\nThis corresponds (independent of a specific acceleration mech-\nanism) to the maximum (theoretically possible) acceleration\nrates (Aharonian et al. 2002) which can only be achieved by\nthe conventional diffusive shock acceleration in the Bohm dif-\nfusion regime.\nOn the other hand, the condition of high efficiency of radia-\ntive cooling of accelerated particles requires extreme parame-\nters characterizing the sub-parsec jets and their environments,\nin particular very high densities of the thermal plasma, radia-\ntion and\/or B-fields. In particular, the proton-synchrotron mod-\nels of TeV blazars require highly magnetized (B \f 10 G) con-\ndensations of \u03b3-ray emitting clouds containing Extremely High\nEnergy (EHE) protons, where the magnetic pressure dominates\nover the pressure of relativistic protons (Aharonian 2000).\nBelow we use the hadronic SPB model\n(M\u00fccke & Protheroe 2000, 2001) to model the average\nspectral energy distribution (SED) of PKS 2155\u2212304 in\nOctober-November 2003. A detailed description of the model,\nand its implementation as a (time-independent) Monte-\nCarlo\/numerical code, has been given in M\u00fccke et al. (2003)\nand Reimer et al. (2004).\nConsidering the rather quiet activity state of\nPKS 2155\u2212304 in Oct.\u2013Nov. 2003, we use the 3EG cata-\nlog spectrum, since it is the best determined EGRET spectrum\n906 F. Aharonian et al.: Multi-wavelength observations of PKS 2155-304 with HESS\nfrom this source to date, as an upper limit for modelling\npurposes.\nFlux variability provides an upper limit for the size of the\nemission region. To allow for a comparative study between lep-\ntonic and hadronic models we fix here the comoving emission\nregion to R \u223c ctvar\u03b4 = 5 \u00d7 1013\u03b4 cm deduced from the X-ray\nvariability. We assume that the optical through X-ray emission\nand the \u03b3-ray output stem from the same region of size R.\nA reasonable model representation for the simultaneous\ndata assuming a Primack04 model for the VHE absorption is\nfound for the following parameters: magnetic field B = 40 G,\nDoppler factor \u03b4 = 20, injection electron spectral index \u03b1e =\n1.6, assumed to be identical to the injection proton spectral in-\ndex \u03b1p, maximum proton energy of order \u03b3p,max \u223c 4 \u00d7 109,\ne\/p-ratio of 0.15 and a near-equipartition proton energy den-\nsity of up = 27 erg cm\u22123. The required total jet power is of\nthe order Ljet \u223c 1.6 \u00d7 1045 erg s\u22121. When using the Phigh\nEBL model, a reasonable representation of the data may be\nachieved by increasing the maximum injected proton energy\nto \u03b3p,max = 1010 and simultaneously increasing the e\/p-ratio\nto 0.24, while all other parameters remain unchanged. Note\nthat here the maximum proton gyro-radius approaches the size\nof the emission region. Alternatively, a doubling of the mag-\nnetic field to 80 G together with an increase of \u03b3p,max to 8\u00d7109\nand a e\/p-ratio of unity (leading to uB \u2248 50up) represents the\nSED-data equally well. In conclusion, none of the \u201cPrimack-\ntype\u201d EBL models can explicitly be ruled out in the frame-\nwork of the SPB-model by the HESS data presented here. In all\ncases, proton synchrotron emission dominates the (sub-)TeV\nradiative output. Depending on the Doppler factor, part of the\nproton synchrotron radiation produced may be reprocessed to\nlower energies. Contributions from the muon and pion cascades\nare always lower than the proton synchrotron component. The\nlow energy component is dominated by synchrotron radiation\nfrom the primary electrons, with a negligible contribution of\nsynchrotron radiation from secondary electrons (produced by\nthe p- and \u00b5\u00b1-synchrotron cascade).\nOn the other hand, the synchrotron radiation of secondary\nelectrons resulting from interactions of VHE \u03b3-rays with ex-\nternal low-energy photons with a modest \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 e+\/e\u2212 opacity\n(\u03c4\u03b3\u03b3 \u2264 1) may lead to significant X-ray emission with a lumi-\nnosity comparable to the luminosity of the primary VHE emis-\nsion (Aharonian 2000).\nModels involving meson production inevitably predict neu-\ntrino emission due to the decay of charged mesons. The\nSPB-model for PKS 2155\u2212304 explains the high energy emis-\nsion dominantly as proton synchrotron radiation, making the\nneutrino flux completely negligible.\n5. Conclusions\nThis paper reports multi-wavelength observations of the\nBL Lac object PKS 2155\u2212304 in 2003. Although the source\nappeared variable in the VHE, X-rays and optical bands, the\nlatter two indicate that PKS 2155\u2212304 was in a state close to\nhistorically low measurements, even though it was easily de-\ntectable by HESS in all nights of observations since the begin-\nning of the detector operation (see AH04 for the observation\nhistory up to August 2003). An extreme case of VHE vari-\nability shows a peak-to-peak increase of a factor of 2.5 \u00b1 0.9\nin 0.09 d. Variability on the timescale of a few ks in the 2\u2013\n10 keV band and of the order of 0.1 d for energies > 300 GeV\nwere observed by RXTE and HESS The X-ray data show\na correlation of the flux with the spectrum, which becomes\nharder when the source is brighter. At the level of the simul-\ntaneously observed modest variability, no correlation between\nthe VHE \u03b3-rays, the X-rays and optical was seen. Observations\nwith greater variability and better coverage are needed before it\ncan be asserted that the VHE\/X-ray pattern in PKS 2155\u2212304\nis different from other known VHE-emitting AGN. Since the\nsource was in a low emission state in both the optical and X-\nrays compared to archival measurements, this lack of corre-\nlation has yet to be established for a higher emission state.\nSimultaneous observations in the X-rays\/optical band and VHE\n\u03b3-rays had never previously been performed on this scale. Its\ncontinual VHE detection makes PKS 2155\u2212304 unique in the\nTeV BL Lac category, and probably indicates that HESS has\nachieved the sensitivity level where it can detect the quiescent\nstate of PKS 2155\u2212304 at any time. A time-averaged energy\nspectrum is determined for the 2 observation periods and fits\nto a power law (\u0393 = 3.37 \u00b1 0.07) in the VHE \u03b3-rays, and to\na broken power law (\u0393L = 2.81 \u00b1 0.05, Eb = 4.9 \u00b1 0.8 keV,\n\u0393H = 2.95 \u00b1 0.04) in the X-rays.\nA comparison of the intrinsic spectrum with predictions\nfrom existing one-zone leptonic and one-zone hadronic mod-\nels is attempted to give a plausible estimation of underlying\nphysical parameters. The values of the parameters are in line\nwith those inferred for other VHE-emitting blazars. In these\nmodels the VHE emission is attenuated according to two dif-\nferent EBL levels. This changes mainly the Doppler boosting\nin the leptonic model, but the high level EBL decreases the\nagreement significantly. In the hadronic model, the maximum\ninjected proton energy can be changed to accomodate different\nEBL levels and can therefore not significantly constrain any of\nthe EBL models used here.\nAcknowledgements.
