Leisure and the Obligation of Self-Work: An Examination of the Fitness Field. \nLeisure Studies. 27(1): 59-75. \n \n \nAbstract: \nThis article examines the cultural field of fitness as a network of producers, \nconsumers, products and practices that has developed around the care of the body \nthrough physical exercise. Drawing on a thematic text analysis of US exercise \nmanuals, the paper focuses on how the commercial fitness field naturalizes \nassociations between physical exercise and leisure, and between leisure and self-\nwork. In particular, the analysis examines three themes and their relevance to our \nbroader understanding of leisure in contemporary consumer society: the management \nof leisure time; the use of leisure for self-investment strategies; and the promotion of \nconsumption as the framework for leisure and an accompanying notion of pleasure. \nThe fitness field casts light on how leisure more generally is constructed as a sphere \nof obligations to make productive use of one\u201fs time, to improve one\u201fs body and self, \nand to do so through the wares of the consumer marketplace. The cultural imaginary \nof leisure as a time of freedom from work and responsibility is thus recast, in an age \nof individualization, as a time of freedom to accomplish the work of self-production. \n \nKeywords: \nbody, consumption, individualization, pleasure, self-investment, time   \n \n \n \nIntroduction \n \nLong-term processes associated with modernity, globalization and post-\nindustrialization have posed challenges to traditional, collective structures of \nmeaning, identity, and regulation, leading some to characterize the contemporary age \nas one of individualization and reflexive self-production (see, among others, Bauman, \n2000, 2004; Beck & Beck-Gernsheim, 2002; Giddens, 1991). As the balance in \nidentity construction shifts from ascribed categories to achieved projects, the \nindividual is faced with the problem of carrying out self-work. But where does one \nstart in making oneself? Unlike the psyche, the body, \u201eour first and most \nunconditional possession\u201f (Simmel, 1950: p. 344), is immediately available for \ninspection, augmentation, and refinement. The body\u201fs prominence in consumer \nculture stems, in large part, from this connection to the problem of identity: the body \nis the consumer object (Baudrillard, 1998), the ultimate site for the production and \ndisplay of the self. As a form of capital necessary to belong and compete in a culture \nand economy of images and impressions, the body must be decorated, improved, \n 2 \nmanaged, and displayed. Working on the body is such an imperative because it is a \nform of capital (Baudrillard, 1998; Bourdieu, 1984, 1986); one can compete without a \nwell-tended body, but one\u201fs chances of success are considerably diminished. In short, \nthe body is a site of work, and work on the body is also, fundamentally, self-work.  \nOne particularly visible mode of self-work in contemporary consumer cultures is \nfitness, typically defined as purposive physical exercise within the context of leisure. \nTime use surveys (Gershuny, 2000) and market research (Mintel, 2006), for example, \nboth employ a \u201eresidual\u201f definition of leisure (Haworth & Lewis, 2005) to categorize \nfitness and sport activities, meaning that fitness activities are considered leisure \nbecause of their occurrence during an individual\u201fs \u201efree\u201f time\u2014the time left over after \npaid and unpaid labour, over which the individual has perceived control. However, \ndefining fitness as leisure is not uncomplicated, for at least two reasons: first, the \nresidual definition of leisure posits a boundary between work and leisure that appears \nto be increasingly porous (e.g. Lewis, 2003; Baxter & Kroll-Smith, 2005); and \nsecond, the hard work of exercise and its associated overtones of moral obligation \n(White, et al., 1995) do not fit easily with the cultural imaginary, or popular notion, of \nleisure as a time of freedom from obligation and productivity.  \nThe cultural imaginary of leisure has ideological implications: the imaginary \u201eis \nthat image or representation of reality which masks the historical and material \nconditions of life\u201f (Ingraham, 1994: p. 203). The concept refers to a way of thinking \nabout leisure that naturalizes the difference between work and leisure as one that is \ncomplete, unchanging, and unquestioned. Resting on this opposition are a host of \npolicies and programmes\u2014past and present\u2014concerning the role of leisure as \ncompensation and recuperation for work. While this stark separation may not apply in \nall lived definitions or experiences of leisure (e.g. Chaplin, 1999; Esteve, et al., \n1999), it is regularly invoked in consumer culture, the reproduction of which rests on \ndiscretionary income from the world of work being spent in the world of leisure\u2014\nconsumer spending making up approximately 70 percent of the United States\u201f Gross \nDomestic Product (Swann, 2006)\u2014rather than being saved or reinvested (as in earlier \nstages of capitalism; Weber, 1992). Both the residual definition and the cultural \nimaginary of leisure rest on the separation of work and leisure. Sociologists of leisure \n(amongst others) have challenged the taken-for-granted mutual opposition of work \nand leisure, calling our attention to the spectrum of activities and continuities of \ndispositions that fall between and across the two realms, and to the historical \nspecificity of the work\/leisure boundary, which must be understood in the context of \nthe dominant political-economic and social order (e.g. Bramham, 2002; Elias & \nDunning, 1986; Parker, 1976; Rojek, 1985, 1989a, 1989b, 1995).  \nFitness is a fruitful lens through which to examine the character and meaning of \nleisure and its contested relationship with work. This article focuses on how, within \nthe commercial fitness field, associations between physical exercise and leisure and, \nin turn, between leisure and self-work are presented as natural and commonsensical, \nrather than historically specific and arbitrary. The discussion proceeds with an \noverview of fitness as a cultural field (Bourdieu, 1993), and a brief examination of the \nhealth club industry as one aspect of the naturalization of fitness as leisure. Drawing \nfrom a thematic text analysis of a sample of popular US exercise manuals, the article \nthen examines three themes and their relevance to our broader understanding of \n 3 \nleisure in contemporary consumer society: the management of leisure time; the use of \nleisure for self-investment strategies; and the role of consumption in framing leisure \nand an attendant notion of pleasure. It is important to underline, here, that this is an \nexamination not of the lived experience of fitness as leisure, but of its ideal \nconstruction through field texts, which may \u201eact as grids for the perception and \nevaluation of things\u201f (Foucault, 1991: p. 81). The fitness field and its texts thus serve \nas windows onto the cultural production of leisure as a sphere of obligations to make \nproductive use of one\u201fs time, to improve one\u201fs body and self, and to do so through the \nwares of the consumer marketplace.    \n \nThe Fitness Field and Leisure \n \nThis article is drawn from the findings of a larger research project (Smith \nMaguire, 2008) on the commercial culture of fitness in the US that examined the \ninterconnections between commercial fitness clubs, fitness media (including exercise \nmanuals, fitness magazines, and specialist personal trainer publications), and fitness \nproducers (including health club managers and personal trainers). Since the 1970s, a \nprogression of exercise fads and fashions have emerged from increasingly \nsophisticated and lucrative fitness industries in consumer societies all over the world, \nbut most notably within the US. In 2000, for example, the US sporting goods industry \n(which includes sports equipment, clothing and footwear) was worth 47.3 billion US \ndollars (Euromonitor, 2001), while consumer spending on sporting goods in the \nUnited Kingdom came to just under 4 billion British pounds, or roughly 7 billion US \ndollars (Mintel, 2004). Similarly, by 2002 the US had over 22,000 commercial health \nclubs, more than the number in Germany, Italy, Spain, France and the United \nKingdom combined.\n1\n \nFitness, however, is more than simply a consumer industry, just as physical \nexercise has long been about more than just bodily vigour and endurance. In the US, \nphysical fitness has been wed to a variety of larger causes, such as moral reform in \nthe nineteenth century Muscular Christianity movement, national strength in \nTheodore Roosevelt\u201fs Strenuous Living philosophy at the turn of the twentieth \ncentury, and personal improvement and enjoyment in the burgeoning service \neconomy of the early twentieth century (Green, 1986; Mrozek, 1989). With the \nexception of times of war, the meaning of fitness over the twentieth century was \npredominantly cast in terms of individual\u2014rather than social\u2014improvement, and \nsince the 1970s the concept of fitness has increasingly narrowed to a commercialized \nlifestyle, an individualized project of self-improvement to be carried out in one\u201fs \nleisure time, through the consumption of exercise programs and fitness goods (Smith \nMaguire, 2008). While goals may vary for specific exercises, the fitness lifestyle is \nrepresented as a general enhancement of health, appearance, and, ultimately, quality \nof life (Howell & Ingham, 2001). As such, the research from which this article is \ndrawn conceptualizes fitness not as a commercial industry but as a commercial \ncultural field (Bourdieu 1984, 1993; Ferguson, 1998; Laberge & Kay, 2002): a \nnetwork of sites, texts, producers, and consumers that generates practices of exercise \nand meanings of the exercised body. The commercial fitness field\u201fs effect is to \n 4 \nnaturalize the association of exercise with leisure, thereby signalling its relative \nautonomy from other exercise-related fields.  \nCommercial health clubs are key sites in the construction of fitness as leisure in \nthe US, claiming 52 percent of all health club members.\n2\n Commercial health clubs \nmarket themselves as leisure businesses and thus define themselves in opposition to \nother, competing sites and institutions, such as the YMCA, which promotes physical \nfitness as an ethical mode of character building; school physical education, which \nutilizes fitness training as a means of instilling qualities deemed valuable by the \nlabour market; physical therapy centres, which subsume exercise within a broader \nbody of medical-therapeutic expertise; and corporate fitness programs, which endorse \nexercise as a means of ensuring productivity (Defrance & Pociello, 1993; Hargreaves, \n1986). As such, fitness is constructed in the terms set by the wider commercial leisure \nfield, which include issues of service, convenience and entertainment. \nFor example, in 1987, the director of the International Health Racquet and \nSportsclub Association (IHRSA) discussed the state of the health club industry in the \ntrade journal Athletic Business:  \n[The] industry is, and is becoming even more so, a convenience industry.  \n\u2026Managed recreation is a repeat business, and any repeat business industry is a \nconvenience industry.  \u2026In 1985, for the first time in decades, the average \nAmerican employee began working more than 40 hours per week. \u2026This time \nfamine is both an opportunity and a limitation for the industry. It\u201fs an opportunity \nbecause clubs now have the real possibility of generating more money from \namenity services than they do from their core membership services. (McCarthy, \n1987: p. 42) \nThe amenity services to which the author refers included dry-cleaning, banking and \nchild-care\u2014in short, converting the health club from a multi-use exercise facility into \na multi-purpose leisure and lifestyle facility. Such thinking reflected a general \nbusiness strategy, informed by market research, which had since the early 1970s \ntaken an interest in the \u201econvenience-oriented customer\u201f (Anderson, 1971). The issue \nof convenience is especially pressing for the commercial fitness field\u201fs core \nconsumers: the professional\/managerial class.\n3\n Despite statistics that show an overall \ndecline in working hours (e.g. nVision, 2005), the professional\/managerial class has \nexperienced an increase in their typical working week (Jacobs & Gerson, 1998; \nLewis, 2003; Zuzanek et al., 1998), thus constraining the amount of discretionary \ntime available for activities such as the use of a health club. The high economic and \ncultural capital of the professional\/managerial class, coupled with constrained \ntemporal capital, makes convenience a key selling point for leisure services. \nBesides service and convenience, the commercial construction of fitness is also \nshaped by the emphasis on entertainment in the wider consumer leisure industries. \nFor example, in a CNN interview, the owner of Crunch, a New York-based chain of \nhealth clubs, makes explicit that he understands his competition in terms of the \noptions his members have for spending their leisure time:  \n[W]e think that people are working longer hours under more stress in their life, \nboth men and women in equal numbers. And we think that, you know, you\u201fre no \nlonger getting out of work at 5 or 5:30 but are now working till 6 or 8 o\u201fclock at \nnight. And some people are working on the weekends. And Crunch feels that it\u201fs \n 5 \ncompeting with Blockbuster. It\u201fs competing with movie chains, with theme \nrestaurants and bars and restaurants. And we think that when you\u201fre out of work \nat 7:30 or 8 o\u201fclock at night, we think that we can eliminate stress in your life and \nentertain you through some of the things that we do. And it\u201fs\u2014our competition is \nother forms of entertainment. (Morris, 1997: no page) \nIn competition for consumers\u201f discretionary time and income, health clubs thus add \nentertainment value to fitness activities; for example, piped-in music, televisions, and \nnovel exercise classes are all standard club features. Unlike many other leisure \nactivities, however, health clubs also have added value thanks to endorsements from \nthe health field, as when the US Surgeon General and World Health Organization \npromote regular exercise as essential for a healthy lifestyle and the reduction of risk \nfor certain diseases. Added leisure values of fun, entertainment and immediacy \n(Harris, 2005) are not only instrumental in the competition between health clubs and \nother leisure businesses, but they also signal the commercial field\u201fs relative autonomy \nfrom the health and political fields that lend it support. Commercial health clubs may \nbenefit from the promotion of exercise in other fields, but they attempt to set the \ncriteria by which they are judged in terms of what they can deliver: not health (as that \nrelies on the individual consumer), but service, convenience and entertainment.  \nTo put this in a broader perspective, commercial health clubs are shaped by the \nfour trends shaping contemporary leisure more generally (Rojek, 1985: pp. 19-23). \nFirst, clubs are an element of the privatization of leisure: exercise is constructed as an \nactivity for one\u201fs private time and\u2014through fee-based club membership\u2014a semi-\nprivate space. Second, the mode of fitness presented in health clubs is an expression \nof the individuation of leisure: even in the context of group classes, the work out is \ntypically performed by individual participants with minimal collective interaction, \nand all eyes trained on the instructor (not unlike the organization of the television or \nfilm audience). Third, clubs exemplify the commercialization of leisure, which \nincreasingly requires entry fees, specialized equipment and ancillary guidebooks and \nservices; indeed, commercial health clubs outnumber non-profit YMCAs in the US by \n11 to 1.\n4\n Finally, health clubs are also manifestations of the long-term pacification of \nleisure, the equipment in health clubs replacing\u2014and at times mimicking\u2014the brute \nexertion and physical hardship of manual labour, within the safe confines of a leisure-\ntime work out. \n \nExercise Manuals and Fitness as Leisure \n \nLike the health club industry, fitness publishing has been central in the \nnaturalization of fitness as leisure (cf. Smith Maguire, 2002, 2006). Specialized texts \nsuch as exercise manuals are crucial \u201einstitutionally constituted points of entry\u201f \n(Jenkins, 1992: p. 85) for the fitness field. Such texts make vicarious participation \npossible (that is, reading about fitness without necessarily working out), as well as \nfacilitating more involved participation (that is, applying an educational attitude to \nfitness activities). Fitness texts\u2014like lifestyle media (Bell & Hollows, 2005), self-\nhelp literature (McGee, 2005) and service journalism (Eide & Knight, 1999)\u2014\nprovide readers\/viewers with both the problems and solutions of everyday life, and in \nso doing provide lessons in both the specific activities of the field and the overall \n 6 \nmentality required of individuals to carry out competent self-production. In the case \nof exercise manuals, the lessons intended for the reader pertain not only to fitness, but \nto leisure and self-work more broadly: first, the management of leisure time; second, \nthe use of leisure for self-investment strategies; and third, the promotion of \nconsumption, accompanied by a specific notion of pleasure, as the framework for \nfitness and, more broadly, leisure. \nThese three lessons or themes emerged from a thematic text analysis of a non-\nprobability purposive sample of thirteen US exercise manuals. The sample was \nchosen to reflect a number of dimensions shaping the fitness field: in particular, \norientation (manuals with a health-education focus, and those more explicitly linked \nto commercial fitness); but also gender (manuals targeted directly at women, at men, \nand at both); class (by and large manuals are a middle class product, but some are \nmore explicitly directed at the professional\/managerial class); links to other lifestyle \nmedia (manuals published by fitness magazines); and changes over time (between \nmanuals from different decades, and different editions of the same manual).\n5\n \nSampling for diversity aims at including a range of perspectives, rather than \nidentifying the typical perspective; the point is not to provide a definitive statement \non the average content of all exercise manuals, but to compare different perspectives \nwithin the same context\u2014a goal to which thematic text analysis is particularly well \nsuited (King, 2004: p. 257).  \nThematic analysis is a means of encoding qualitative data that uses a priori \nthemes (based on one\u201fs research questions and relevant literature) to organize the \ndata, but which also involves an ongoing refinement of the themes; given the \ncombination of deductive and inductive coding, the final template of themes is likely \nto have moved beyond the initial themes (Boyatzis, 1998; Fereday & Muir-Cochrane, \n2006; King, 2004). As such, thematic analysis is different from, but not unrelated to, \nthe Grounded Theory approach (Glaser & Strauss, 1967): the thematic analyst arrives \nat the data with an outline of what he or she is looking for, but through memos \n(thoughts that arise in the course of coding that may or may not emerge as a repeated \npattern in the data) and comparison between data sources, new themes will emerge \nfrom the data, and pre-existing themes will be revised or removed (King, 2004).  \nAnalysis of the exercise manuals began with immersion: reading and re-reading, \nmaking notes on, and making copies of the table of contents, introductory chapters, \nand selected chapter content. The initial note-making, as with the more \ncomprehensive manual coding that followed, was guided by themes derived from the \nlarger project\u201fs research questions and cultural field framework, which included \nissues of authority, status, and problematization (and, as such, the final template and \nanalysis include more than the three themes discussed in this article; see Smith \nMaguire, 2008). The a priori template was also in part derived from the manuals \nthemselves, using a preliminary analysis of the tables of contents to identify repeated \nthemes used to structure the content of the books. The educational aim of the exercise \nmanuals makes them relatively structured texts (as opposed to, for example, an \nexerciser\u201fs diary entries), and facilitates a more flexible, less structured thematic text \nanalysis (Hogenraad et al., 2003; King, 2004).  \n 7 \nFrom the analysis of the exercise manuals, three themes emerged that are of \nparticular relevance to an understanding of leisure, related to time, self-investment, \nand consumption. These are discussed in detail below.   \n \nLeisure and Time Management \nThe cultural imaginary of leisure implies a separation from work\u2014a time of \nchoice and freedom to do as one pleases; a time unencumbered by the need to be \nproductive. While the separation of leisure and work is increasingly blurry in the \npost-industrial context, time remains a significant marker. For example, Lewis\u201f \n(2003) research on accountants suggests that when white-collar workers define extra \nhours at work as a choice and source of enjoyment, it is the fact that they have chosen \nto use their time in this way that signifies an element of leisure, despite still being in \nthe physical space of work. In exercise manuals, the association between exercise and \nleisure is accomplished through a demarcation of time, but as the discussion below \nillustrates, this construction of fitness as leisure inserts discipline and a productive \nlogic into the realm of \u201efree time.\u201f  \nFitness activities are not the only form of activity vying for consumers\u201f and, \nespecially, professional\/managerial consumers\u201f, leisure time. While manuals may \nattempt to dissuade readers from taking up these other options (many of which have \nimplications for fitness, such as television watching), exercise manuals more \ngenerally construct the problem as one of better disciplining or managing the time \nthat one has. An exercise manual by the American Heart Association (AHA), for \nexample, expresses the obstacles to getting fit in terms of time:  \nYou know you should be more physically active. You even want to be. But where \nwill you find the time? And just how active do you have to be? Fitting in Fitness \nwill help you find the answers. \u2026This Fitting in Fitness handbook is designed to \nhelp you get off the sofa and get moving with minimal hassle and maximum \nresults. (American Heart Association, 1997: pp. xiii-xiv) \nAccordingly, the AHA manual goes on to suggest hundreds of ways to insert aerobic \nactivity into daily life, including taking the dog for a walk, using stairs rather than \nelevators, and using water jugs for weight-bearing exercises. Similar instructions \nappear in other manuals, constructing fitness as an individual choice of how to spend \none\u201fs discretionary time rather than, for example, promoting collective strategies such \nas exercise breaks during the workday. \nAn exercise manual by the publisher of Men\u2019s Health magazine targets time-\npressed affluent male readers. The authors attempt to educate their readers in the role \nof time management for leisure: \nThe issue [of time for fitness] really boils down to time management\u2014using those \n86,400 seconds wisely and efficiently enough each day so that you can spare at \nleast 1,800 of them for exercise. It\u201fs a matter of setting priorities. One national \nsurvey of men in their thirties and forties found that 67 percent include being \nhealthy and fit in their personal definition of success. \u2026Being in great shape is \nsomething that we\u201fd love to do\u2026if we had the time. (Kaufman & Kirchheimer, \n1997: p. 28) \nThe manual includes several time management suggestions, including laying out your \nclothes the night before, hiring help for chores to create time for exercise, and waking \n 8 \nup earlier. Here, the assumed character of the intended class of readers mediates how \ntime is constructed: such lessons apply what is taken as an unproblematic, work-\noriented notion of time to leisure\u2014not only using time management strategies to \ncarve out time for fitness leisure, but also making one\u201fs leisure time more efficient. \nIn general, exercise manuals suggest a range of techniques for managing leisure \ntime that are in keeping with the Protestant work ethic (Weber, 1992), including \nscheduling and exercising at the same time each day, using an exercise log and other \nrecord-keeping devices, and charting one\u201fs progress\u2014all means to \u201eturn mere \nbehavior into a good habit\u201f (American College of Sports Medicine, 1998: p.17). In \nanother manual geared towards men, readers are encouraged to use time-management \nskills they already have to insert exercise into their lives: \nWhen you\u201fre starting out with a fitness program, self-discipline is often one of \nyour highest hurdles. Many people find that devising a schedule is the easiest way \naround that. In the beginning, you may want to schedule your workouts at the \nsame time each day. \u2026Making specific appointments and keeping them is \nsomething you\u201fre used to in life. If you can do it for the dentist, you can do it for \nyour sense of well-being. (Levy & Shafran, 1986: pp. 19-20) \nA manual addressing women consumers from the publishers of Self magazine makes \nthe same point, telling readers to make fitness \u201edates\u201f (Billings, 1998: p. 42), \nsuggesting how the gender, as well as class, of the assumed reader mediates the \nconstruction of fitness as leisure. In these attempts to habituate exercise, the \u201enew\u201f \nhabit is thus affiliated with already-established habits, such as making and keeping \nappointments. \nAs illustrated in the previous examples, the construction of leisure time in the \nexercise manuals reproduces the primacy given to individual choice and sovereignty \nwithin consumer culture, and the ideology of self-responsibility that characterizes this \nera of individualization (Bauman, 2000; Beck & Beck-Gernsheim, 2002; Slater, \n1997). In such a context, population inactivity (a concern of the AHA, among other \ninstitutions) is addressed not through calls for collective solutions, which are likely to \nbe opposed as infringements on individual choice, but through calls to better \ndiscipline one\u201fs non-work time, which ironically reaffirm the equation in the popular \nimagination of leisure with freedom and choice. The exercise manuals\u201f lessons in \ntime management are part of a wider move to entrust individuals with the choice of \nbeing fit\u2014and thus to hold individuals accountable for a lack of fitness (Ingham, \n1985). This underlines the political nature of leisure and leisure time (Rojek, 1989b): \nthe governing of populations in a neo-liberal society relies on the governing of \nleisure, such that individuals enact their freedom and make choices in keeping with \nbroader social agendas (Barry et al., 1996). The political order requires that the \nfreedom of leisure be productive, and the body-at-leisure be disciplined and \npredictable (Frank, 1991). \nDisciplinary techniques such as scheduling and record-keeping are offered as \ntools to help readers to exercise. More generally, the \u201ediscipline \u201cmakes\u201d individuals\u201f \n(Foucault, 1977: P. 170), ideally producing a habitual order of behaviours, such as \ntime management and self-scrutiny (as well as physical exercise). For Foucault, the \nkey feature of disciplinary power is that the control of movements, times and spaces \n(through time keeping, regimentation, record keeping, etc.) not only produces \n 9 \ncompetencies (we become good at our exercises) but also a capacity for self-\nsurveillance. We internalize the disciplinary gaze and thus make it play upon \nourselves spontaneously (Foucault, 1977: p. 202), even as, and perhaps because, the \nexperience of such self-surveillance\u2014in the context of leisure\u2014is swathed in \nconnotations of freedom. In an era of individualization, if we are not only free to \nchoose our identity, but are \u201eobliged to be free,\u201f (Rose, 1996: p. 17), then what could \nbe more effective than to locate the exercise of obligation in the imagined realm of \nfreedom?     \n \nLeisure as Self-Investment \nIn addition to lessons on better disciplining leisure time, the exercise manuals \nattempt to overcome the apparent conflict between the work of exercise and its \nmarketing as leisure by promoting a cost-benefit logic: the effort of exercise pays off \nin terms of cultural, physical and social capital (Bourdieu, 1986). Exercise manuals \nthus attempt to \u201emobilize\u201f the reader (cf. Miller & Rose, 1997) by connecting the \nperceived fears and aspirations of the middle class target market (anxiety about the \nimpression made upon others, the desire to promote oneself and be successful in the \nlabour and social marketplaces) with the rewards associated with exercise (better \nhealth, confidence, appearance). As with time management, the lesson in leisure as \nself-investment reinforces a productive logic: leisure time is to be used to produce \nvalue\u2014the value of the fit body. \nIn his assessment of the body in action, Frank (1991: p. 55) suggests that the \ndisciplined body in consumer culture is closely related to the mirroring body, in that \nsuccessful discipline gives rise to a body that reflects social ideals and mirrors \ndominant images. The benefits of fitness (the rewards of self-discipline and effective \ntime management) are thus formulated in the dominant terms of consumer body \nculture\u2014attractiveness, confidence, vitality, charisma. Consider, for example, the \nfollowing excerpt from a weight training manual: \nWeight training helps give you the feeling that you are your body, not just in it. \n\u2026Your body is no longer something you drag along or something that holds you \nback. \u2026How you look is a basic part of your social identity and as you change \nand improve the look of your body you will see a change in the attitude of people \nyou come into contact with. These days there aren\u201ft many things in life that an \nindividual can control\u2026but you can become the master of your own body. \n(Dobbins & Sprague, 1981: pp. 7-8) \nThe authors\u201f representation of control as mastery of one\u201fs social presence\u2014\nconfidence in and as a body\u2014recalls Bourdieu\u201fs (1984) work on how class and \noccupation inflect bodily dispositions. This is an example of the role of such texts in \nreproducing and disseminating popular beliefs and values; in this case, the middle \nclass interest in status, style and the body-for-others (Bourdieu, 1984: p. 213).  \nBesides improved appearance and confidence, health is also portrayed in the \nmanuals as a pay-off from the self-investment of exercise. Health in Western culture \nhas long been considered an individual responsibility and a natural state (Whorton, \n1982), and in a neo-liberal era of entrepreneurial citizens, this translates into a moral \nimperative for individuals to be responsible for their health and fitness (Crawford, \n1980; White, et al., 1995). Ill health (or simply the failure to \u201elook healthy\u201f) is taken \n 10 \nas a sign of transgressions against nature, serving as a symbol of personal inadequacy. \nLike self-presentation, a healthy appearance is a form of symbolic capital. In the \nabsence of a healthy appearance, reading an exercise manual or belonging to a health \nclub can, at least, signify one\u201fs moral character, demonstrating that one is cognizant \nof the responsibility of self-care.   \nExercise manuals make clear that fitness is a strategic mode of self-investment \nand offer it as a panacea for all of one\u201fs problems:   \nFitness, as you know, touches on every aspect of your life. With exercise, you\u201fll: \nLook and feel better; Cut your risk of deadly diseases\u2026; Have better sex and even \nprevent impotence; Meet new people, develop friendships, or maybe even find \nyour future mate; Boost your self-confidence many times over. (Kaufman & \nKirchheimer, 1997: p. 2) \nThe point, here, is not to discount the physical and mental health benefits of \nexercise\u2014for which there is compelling scientific evidence (see, for example, \nHardman & Stensel, 2003)\u2014but to highlight how leisure is constructed as the sphere \nof self-care, in which to attend to all of the problems (potential, real, imagined) of the \nbody and self in contemporary society. In a consumer service economy, looking good \nand looking healthy bear on one\u201fs exchange value (Featherstone, 1982), especially for \nthose in the service class whose stock-in-trade are images and appearances. The \nconsumption of fitness manuals and magazines\u2014and lifestyle and self-improvement \nguides more broadly\u2014is thus inextricably linked to the increasing cultural emphasis \non, and economic value of, the cultivation of self-presentation skills.  \nThe economic pragmatism of self-investment may sit awkwardly with the cultural \nimaginary of leisure as a time of freedom and relaxation, but leisure scholars will \nrecognize this as indicative of the impossibility of drawing a hard and fast line \nbetween work and leisure. Along these lines, Elias and Dunning (1986: pp. 96-8) \noutlined a \u201espare time spectrum\u201f, in which discretionary time is used to accomplish a \nmultitude of tasks that fall into three main categories: spare-time routines (such as the \nroutine care of one\u201fs self and household); orientation and self-expansion activities \n(such as volunteer work, hobbies and self-improvement work); and more typical \nleisure activities (such as socializing, mimetic and play activities). These are not \nmutually exclusive categories; time-pressed individuals in particular may use \n\u201esimultaneous consumption\u201f to combine multiple functions (Chaplin, 1999: p. 45). \nThus, mimetic and socializing activities (such as attending a cardio-box class and \nchatting with friends at a health club) overlap with self-expansion activities (the \nphysical and social capital from the health club used for occupational advancement). \nWhat is striking in the exercise manuals is the degree to which the logic of self-\nexpansion pervades the representation of leisure time: leisure is not so much a \ncategory sitting alongside self-expansion activities, as a category overwritten by the \nlogic of self-improvement. One could argue that this is a feature, more generally, of \nleisure in contemporary consumer economies: the logic of self-investment potentially \ntransforms even banal, routine care activities into vehicles for self-expression and \nstatus-positioning, and thus opportunities for profit.   \nThe application of a work ethic to leisure activities has been well documented in \nleisure research. For example, past research suggests that those with jobs that involve \nhigher levels of autonomy (such as the professional\/managerial class) are more likely \n 11 \nto have an \u201eextension\u201f pattern to their work-leisure relationship, meaning that work \nand leisure share at least some common characteristics or style, and that there is no \nclear demarcation experienced between the two spheres (Parker, 1976). Writing thirty \nyears ago, Parker noted that leisure was becoming more like work,  quoting from \nStone\u201fs earlier analysis: \u201emore and more we work at our play\u2026we begin to evaluate \nour leisure in terms of the potential it has for work\u201f (Stone, 1958: p. 285, cited in \nParker 1976: p. 70). However, the application of work values to leisure activities, and \nmore generally the treatment of leisure time as a market resource (Rojek, 1989a, \n1995), does not necessarily indicate that leisure is simply becoming more like work. \nConsider, for example, how work is becoming more like leisure, in creative work \nplaces (Florida, 2002), in the rise of the workplace nap (Baxter & Kroll-Smith, 2005), \nor in the ways in which some aspects of domestic labour (such as cooking and \ngardening) have taken on a \u201emore leisurely, discretionary component\u201f (nVision, 2006: \np. 3). Normatively conceptualized as separate spheres, leisure and work (like culture \nand economy; see du Gay & Pryke, 2002) are mutually produced through material \npractices, rather than existing as a priori, static categories. The question thus becomes \nnot whether there is a new \u201eblurring\u201f of leisure and work (as if they were ever wholly \nseparate spheres), but how they are mutually defined at particular historical and social \nmoments. Understandings and experiences of leisure are\u2014and have been since the \n\u201einvention\u201f of leisure in early modern Europe (Burke, 1995)\u2014interdependent with the \nsocial organization of work and capital. Parker\u201fs (1976) findings illustrate how the \ncategories of work and leisure are contextual, shaped by individuals\u201f particular \nlocations in the mode of production.  \nThe marketing of exercise as a panacea and the use of cost-benefit rhetoric \nencourages participation in fitness as a means to some other end, rather than an end in \nitself\u2014an instrumental construction of leisure that has implications for the notion of \npleasure, as discussed with regard to the third leisure theme.  \n \nConsumption, Leisure and Pleasure \nIn addition to the naturalization of fitness as leisure, and promoting fitness \nthrough its physical and social capital rewards, exercise manuals also represent fitness \nas a consumer activity. Leisure and consumption are doubly connected: leisure is \nincreasing commodified; and notions of leisure facilitate commodification. That is, on \nthe one hand, leisure time has become increasingly colonized by consumer products \nand services since the post-war leisure boom; on the other, an affiliation with leisure \nlends connotations of \u201efun, freedom and self-expression\u201f (Harris, 2005: p. 12) to \nconsumer goods and services.   \nThe authors of exercise manuals produce the relatively uniform message that \nexercise-as-leisure requires consumer goods and services. The endorsement of fitness \nproducts is not limited to explicitly consumption-oriented guides, such as the manual \nfrom the publishers of Men\u2019s Health magazine. In the manuals from both the AHA \nand American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), for example, the goal of making \nphysical activity accessible to a general population\u2014through downplaying the \nnecessity of consumer expense\u2014is accompanied by the acknowledgement that fitness \nproducts and services are often regarded as an essential part of getting fit: \n 12 \nWe\u201fll say it again: All you need to fit in fitness is a comfortable pair of walking \nshoes. So why spend money on fitness equipment? In a word, variety. Variety is \nnot only the spice of life, it\u201fs what keeps physical activity fun. Boredom, on the \nother hand, is one of the most common reasons people give for quitting regular \nexercise. (American Heart Association, 1997: p. 96) \nSimilarly, the ACSM\u201fs manual (1992:  p. 102) acknowledges: \u201eSome people find \nhome exercising lonely or boring and want the variety and socializing that a fitness \ncenter can offer.\u201f Fitness educators, producers, and promoters are constrained not \nonly by the tastes of consumers, but also by broader social demands for fun, \nimmediacy, novelty and variety; elements, which if not available in the activities \nthemselves are furnished through the associated fitness products and services.   \nConsumption also comes into play in the manuals\u201f attempts to motivate readers to \nmaintain their exercise regimes. Indeed, material self-reward has become a standard \ntechnique for habituation and motivation in contemporary consumer culture:  \nBe nice to yourself\u2026 Attach an appropriate reward to each of your long-term, \nshort-term and immediate goals. If you lose the 15 pounds over 6 months, buy \nyourself that watch you\u201fve been wanting. \u2026Sure, it\u201fs bribery, but it works. \n(Schlosberg and Neporent, 1996: p. 28) \nThe indulgence of shopping is thus made permissible through the discipline of \nexercise, providing consumers with a formula for negotiating the larger tension in  \nconsumer culture between hedonism and discipline. Such \u201ecalculating hedonism\u201f \n(Jacoby, 1980, cited in Featherstone 1982: p. 18) resolves, at least momentarily, the \ndouble-bind of the fitness consumer\u2014to be a \u201egood body\u201f requires self-discipline; to \nbe a \u201egood consumer\u201f requires self-gratification. Here, the two obligations are \nconfigured as sequential rather than conflicting aspects of the same lifestyle: do two \nmore sit-ups now, buy the wristwatch later. \nThe fitness industry benefits from endorsements from external fields such as \nhealth promotion and physical education, and gains institutional support and scientific \nlegitimacy from non-profit organizations such as the AHA. Nevertheless, health \nclubs, fitness magazines and other fitness products operate not within the health or \nmedical fields, but within a consumer field, its relative autonomy established through \nthe differences between exercise-as-medicine and exercise-as-leisure. The former \nmay be \u201egood,\u201f but the latter is \u201efun.\u201f Or is it? Fun is spontaneous, immediate, \nirrational, inconsequential (Ferguson, 1989; Huizinga, 1970). In terms of time use, \nself-investment rewards, and legitimation of consumer indulgence, however, exercise \nmanuals construct fitness not as fun, but as a rational, instrumental activity, \nassociated with an instrumental notion of pleasure.\n6\n Non-instrumental fun has been \nidentified as a key to understanding the social function and individual engagement \nwith forms of leisure (e.g. Elias & Dunning, 1986; Ferguson, 1989; Maguire, 1992); \nyet, modernity has been marked by a diminution of this \u201eplay element\u201f in everyday \nlife (Huizinga, 1970). It is this form of fun that is noticeably absent in the exercise \nmanuals.   \nThe predominant construction of pleasure in the sample of exercise manuals is a \ndecidedly narrow one: pleasure is to be found in one\u201fs righteous self-discipline and in \none\u201fs body-for-others\u2014the confidence one gets from a fit body, the impression it \n 13 \nmakes upon others, the chance to shop for it\u2014and not in the exercise activities \nthemselves. Consider the following example from Jane Fonda\u201fs Workout Book: \nYou will always have a good reason to skip your workout. You could be cleaning \nthe house, baking, watching a movie, going straight home from work or sleeping \nlate. But when you make yourself exercise and afterwards feel that tingle through \nyour body, the sense of exhilaration and your own pleasure in your discipline, \nyou\u201fll agree it was worth it. (Fonda, 1981: p. 56) \nEven in those instances in which the physical sensation of working out is highlighted \nas pleasurable (such as Fonda\u201fs descriptions of \u201ethe burn\u201f), such corporeal immediacy \nis yoked to something at-a-distance: the approval of others, reduced health risks, and \nso forth.     \nDespite the post-modern aspects of fitness activities (such as the simulation of \nmanual labour through the use of exercise machines; see Glassner, 1989), exercise \nmanuals, at least, remain a resolutely modern form, in which pleasure is privileged \nover fun. This is not to suggest that fitness activities hold no opportunities for fun, or \nfor \u201epeak\u201f or \u201eflow\u201f experiences (Csikszentmihalyi, 1975; see also Maguire, 1992), in \nwhich one is so absorbed in the activity that there ceases to be a conscious awareness \nof a separation of the self from the activity, allowing an enjoyable loss of self. This \nsort of non-instrumental immediacy remains at the core of the cultural imaginary of \nleisure in consumer culture\u2014leisure linked not to the function of social control and \nthe instrumental reproduction of the social order, but to the ethos of spontaneity, \nexcitement, play and irrationality (e.g. Dumazedier, 1974; Ferguson, 1989; Rojek, \n1995). However, the commercial nature of the fitness field (and leisure more broadly) \nconstrains the ideal construction (and, in a different way, the subjective experience) \nof the playful aspects of leisure. In a consumer society, the obligation and pleasure of \nself-work are harnessed as the engine of the economy and social reproduction. \nPleasure is instrumentalized, both as a means of motivating individuals to exercise, \nand as part of the larger reproduction of service economies, consumer cultures and \nneo-liberal social orders that rely on self-managing, responsible individuals.   \n \nConclusion \n \nFitness need not necessarily be associated with leisure. Historically, physical \nexercise has also been linked with the military, work preparedness, religion and moral \ncharacter building, and therapeutic health regimes. Moreover, working out does not \nreadily fit with the cultural imaginary of leisure as a time of freedom, relaxation and \nnon-instrumental activity. Commercial fitness thus contains a conflict between the \nsustained work and discipline of physical exercise and consumer culture\u201fs messages \nof fun and instant results. It is this tension\u2014between notions of work and ideals of \nleisure\u2014that makes fitness such a fruitful case study of the meaning of leisure in \ncontemporary society.   \n  The commercial health club industry and exercise manual authors reproduce \ntaken-for-granted assumptions about consumers\u201f (and especially \nprofessional\/managerial consumers\u201f) patterns of activity, occupational resources, \nwork ethos, bodily dispositions and general interest in the cultivation of status and \nappearance. These assumptions mediate how fitness is constructed as an activity \n 14 \nproperly belonging to leisure time, through which work may be done on the body, \nhealth and self. The analysis of exercise manuals suggests how the two concepts of \nleisure and work are mutually constitutive rather than mutually exclusive. The \napplication of a Protestant work ethic to the management of leisure time and \ninvestment in appearance- and health-related symbolic capital represent points of \nconvergence between the mentalities and rationalities of the paid-work sphere and \ndiscretionary leisure time. Common sense attributes and uses of work and leisure \nreflect broader social forces and changes: a political-economic system that places \nemphasis on individual responsibility; a culture of consumption fuelled by promises \nof individual choice and freedom; and a class structure and mode of production in \nwhich some may experience aspects of work (paid and unpaid) as leisurely.  \nRunning parallel with the cultural imaginary of leisure as a time of freedom from \nwork and responsibility is the construction of leisure as a time of freedom to take up \nthe obligation of self-work. This is not a new conception of leisure, but it is one that, \nover the modern period, has been extended to a wider population. Writing at the turn \nof the twentieth century, Veblen commented upon the \u201ework\u201f required of the \nnouveaux riches to display and defend their new class position. Social mobility \nrequired that the gentleman \u201echange his life of leisure into a more or less arduous \napplication to the business of learning how to live a life of ostensible leisure in a \nbecoming way\u201f (1959: p. 34). In the contemporary era, the individual is faced with \nthe obligation of productive leisure\u2014the arduous task of making oneself \u201efit\u201f for a \nlife in a consumer culture and service economy.   \nLeisure as a time of doing nothing, of idleness, is a refusal of the obligation of \nproductivity and is thus reserved for the very wealthy (for whom it is sanctioned), and \ntolerated in the very poor (although even the unemployed must show themselves to be \nactively re-skilling and seeking jobs; Dean, 1995). For the remainder, leisure must be \na time for the \u201eproduction of value\u2014distinctive value, status value, prestige value\u201f \n(Baudrillard 1998: p. 157). The commercial fitness field is but one example of the \ninstitutional and discursive modes by which individuals are educated in how to yield \nmore value from their available time and corporeal resources. \n \nReferences  \nAmerican College of Sports Medicine.

Similarly, fitness magazine media kits show \nthat more than a third of readers are professional\/managerial workers (Smith Maguire, \n2008). \n4\n The proportion of commercial health clubs to YMCAs is based on a 2005 count of \n29,069 commercial clubs (from the IHRSA website, \nhttp:\/\/cms.ihrsa.org\/IHRSA\/viewPage.cfm?pageId=804; accessed January 2007) and \n2,617 YMCAs (from the YMCA website, http:\/\/www.ymca.net; accessed January \n2007). \n5\n The sample was composed of five exercise manuals from the health-education-\norientation (the American College of Sports Medicine\u201fs ACSM Fitness Book (1992 \nand 1998 editions), American Heart Association\u201fs Fitting in Fitness (1997), and \nFitness Facts (1989) and its 1999 2\nnd\n Edition, The Health Fitness Handbook), and \neight from the more commercially-oriented perspective (The Gold\u2019s Gym Weight \nTraining Book (1978), Jane Fonda\u2019s Workout Book (1981), Nautilus Fitness for \nWomen (1983), Gym Psych (1986), Fitness for Dummies (1996 and 2000 editions), \nStronger Faster (from the publishers of Men\u2019s Health magazine, 1997), and Self \nmagazine\u201fs 1998 Self\u2019s Better Body Book). \n 20 \n \n6\n \u201eFun\u201f and \u201epleasure\u201f are used interchangeably in popular discourse (and the cultural \nimaginary of leisure); even in academic literature the terms are often confused.  \nRegardless of the terms used by individual authors, the key distinguishing feature is \nthe degree of instrumentality: is the leisure form pursued as an end in itself, or is it \npursued as a means to some other end? \n \n \n"}
