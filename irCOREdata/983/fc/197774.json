INTRODUCTION \nFreeganism is an alternative consumption strategy which involves taking goods that \nappear abandoned, without paying for them.  The freeganism concept is discussed in \ndepth below in Part 2.  This article will assess whether freegans commit a property \noffence, specifically theft.  In Part 3 I will show that freeganism cannot be considered \nto be theft.  The first argument concerns the nature of the ownership interest in the \nrelevant goods.  I will show that there is a possibility, even taking into account the \nrestrictive nature of the doctrine, that the goods had been abandoned.  The second \nargument, which is more persuasive, concerns the freegan\u2019s state of mind.  I argue \nthat freegans are not doing anything so dishonest as to attract a criminal sanction.  \nPart 4 is a conclusion. \n2. FREEGANISM \nFreeganism is not a coherent philosophy, nor does it have a consistent theoretical \nbasis.1\n                                                 \n1 W Skidelsky, \u2018The freegans\u2019 creed: waste not, want not\u2019 The Observer (London 19 July 2009) \n  It can however be loosely characterised as an anti-consumerist movement, \nhttp:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/environment\/2009\/jul\/19\/freegan-environment-food: it is an \u2018ill-defined \nactivity \u2026 [without] any one clear statement of their aims and motivations.\u2019  On freeganism, see \ngenerally the information available at http:\/\/www.freegan.org.uk; \nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Freeganism; http:\/\/freegan.info\/; http:\/\/freegan.org.uk\/.  See A Weissman \n\u2018Everyday Revolutions: Practices and Institutions for Living Beyond Capitalism in Everyday Life\u2019 (at \nhttp:\/\/freegan.info\/?page_id=174), text accompanying fn 30 \u2013 fn 48 for links to various examples of \nfreeganism.  See also in general the media links page at http:\/\/freegan.info\/?page_id=50.  There are \nalso newspaper articles describing freeganist behaviour in England, available at \nhttp:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/lifeandstyle\/2007\/aug\/19\/foodanddrink.ethicalfood; \nhttp:\/\/www.dailyecho.co.uk\/news\/features\/living\/3961963.Freeganism___making_use_of_things_shop\ns_throw_away\/; \nhttp:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/finance\/newsbysector\/retailandconsumer\/2793564\/Dumpster-diving-with-\nthe-freegans-Why-pay-for-food.html.

Freegans often tend towards a left-wing political ideology which supports a \ngeneral opposition to capitalism,2 although there are exceptions.3  Others may become \nfreegans in opposition to the considerable waste that is produced by consumer culture, \nin particular the food waste produced by supermarkets.4\n \n  Although the multifaceted \nnature of freeganism prohibits an exhaustive definition, it is the aim of this article to \nanalyse freegan practice. \nFreegans employ \u2018strategies for living based on limited participation in the \nconventional economy and minimal consumption of resources.\u20195  Although \nfreeganism is rooted in veganism and vegetarianism, 6 there is no restriction of \nfreeganism to foodstuffs: all types of goods can be \u201cfreeganised\u201d.  Regardless of \nwhether the goods are organic or inorganic, all the goods that a freegan will be \ninterested in have a common element: they reach a point of obsolescence.  The point \nof obsolescence will vary for inherent technological or organic reasons,7\n                                                 \n2 See eg \n but different \npeople can and do place different \u201cend-use points\u201d to the same goods.  Freegans will \nhttp:\/\/freegan.info\/, where the front page of the website provides a variety of anti-consumerist \nand leftist descriptions of and justifications for freeganism, such as this: \u2018Freeganism is a total boycott \nof an economic system where the profit motive has eclipsed ethical considerations and where \nmassively complex systems of productions ensure that all the products we buy will have detrimental \nimpacts most of which we may never even consider.  Thus, instead of avoiding the purchase of \nproducts from one bad company only to support another, we avoid buying anything to the greatest \ndegree we are able.\u2019   \n3 L J Strahilevitz \u2018The Right to Abandon\u2019 John M Olin Law & Economics Working Paper No 455 \n(February 2009, available at http:\/\/ssrn.com\/abstract=1348211), at p 3, text to fn 3: \u2018As a testament to \nthe prevalence of abandonment, it appears that some of these freegans are able to live essentially \npleasant, middle-class lives.\u2019   \n4 See generally T Stuart Waste: Uncovering the Global Food Scandal (Penguin: London 2009).  Stuart \nwas the subject of a recent newspaper feature: W Skidelsky, \u2018The freegans\u2019 creed: waste not, want not\u2019 \nThe Observer (London 19 July 2009) http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/environment\/2009\/jul\/19\/freegan-\nenvironment-food.  \n5 http:\/\/freegan.info\/.  \n6 See eg http:\/\/freegan.info\/, noting that the term \u2018freegan\u2019 appears to be a portmanteau of \u2018free\u2019 and \n\u2018vegan\u2019.  See also http:\/\/www.freegan.org.uk\/ukfreegans\/?page_id=6, describing meat-eating freegans \nas \u2018meagans\u2019. \n7 See eg S Strasser Waste and Want: A Social History of Trash (New York: Henry Holt, 2000) pp 191-\n201, pp 274-278 (discussing planned obsolescence); J Scanlan On Garbage (London: Reaktion Books, \n2005) p 34. \n 4 \nconsider the \u201cend-use point\u201d to be at a later point in the object\u2019s \u201clife-span\u201d compared \nwith non-freegans.  This willingness to use goods others deem obsolete provides a \nbasis for freeganism.  In addition to this, the aim of freeganism is to obtain goods \nwithout having to pay for them.  This can occur through many methods, such as \nbarter.8  However, one particular freegan practice has provoked media interest in the \n\u2018sensational\u2019:9\n \n \u201cbin-diving\u201d.  It is this particular practice which is the focus of this \nanalysis. \nOne freegan website gives the following description of bin-diving:  \n \n\u2018Perhaps the most notorious freegan strategy is what is commonly called \n\u201curban foraging\u201d or \u201cdumpster diving\u201d.  This technique involves rummaging \nthrough the garbage of retailers, residences, offices, and other facilities for \nuseful goods.  Despite our society\u2019s [stereotypes] about garbage, the goods \nrecovered by freegans are safe, useable, clean, and in perfect or near-perfect \ncondition, a symptom of a throwaway culture that encourages us to constantly \nreplace our older goods with newer ones, and where retailers plan high-\nvolume product disposal as part of their economic model.  Some urban \nforagers go at it alone, others dive in groups, but we always share the \ndiscoveries openly with one another and with anyone along the way who \nwants them.\u201910\n \n \n                                                 \n8 This will cover the Freecycle movement, where individuals post notices on the internet that goods are \nfree for those who are willing to pick them up.  See eg http:\/\/www.uk.freecycle.org\/.  \n9 http:\/\/freegan.org.uk\/pages\/faq.php#10. \n10 http:\/\/freegan.info\/.  For a distinction between garbage (animal and vegetable matter) and rubbish, \ntrash and refuse (all other types of waste) see eg Strasser, above n 7, p 29 at fn *.  For reasons of clarity \nthis distinction is not maintained herein. \n 5 \nThis analysis is restricted to bin-diving, which is defined for these purposes as where \nsomeone takes goods, which have been disposed of as rubbish, out of the receptacle \ncontaining them, for further use, ie personal consumption.   \n \nThere are various arguments for and against allowing freeganism in general and bin-\ndiving in particular.  On one hand, it is arguable that if the owner of goods wishes to \ndispose of them as rubbish, then that wish should not be interfered with.  The right to \nalienate one\u2019s self from goods is an incident of the rights of ownership,11\n \n and it is \narguable that that right extends beyond the mere privilege of disposal by imposing a \nduty on others not to interfere with the result of the disposal ie waste.  Such an \nextended duty may be justified on environmental grounds, or on privacy grounds.  \nThese issues will be discussed in turn. \nEnvironmental justifications may be put forward as both prohibiting and supporting \nthe practice of bin-diving.  If the rubbish is environmentally unsound, then there is a \nrational public policy justification for restricting access to that rubbish,12 based on the \ngeneral duty not to harm others.13\n                                                 \n11 See eg A M Honor\u00e9 \u2018Ownership\u2019 in A G Guest (ed) Oxford Essays in Jurisprudence (Oxford: OUP, \n1965) pp 107-147, at p 118.  There is of course controversy concerning the application of this right to \ncultural treasures (see eg J L Sax, Playing Darts with a Rembrandt: Public and Private Rights in \nCultural Treasures (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1999)), but freegans will be concerned \nwith foodstuffs, not paintings. \n  This manifests itself effectively in a prohibition on \nabandonment of things where the act of abandonment would have a negative \n12 Hudson uses this argument to justify the decision in R v Edwards and Stacey (1877) 13 Cox CC 384: \nsee A H Hudson, \u2018Is Divesting Abandonment Possible at Common Law?\u2019 (1984) 100 LQR 110, 115 fn \n42: \u2018Policy considerations of aspects of health clearly underlay the decision\u2019.  Later, in \u2018Abandonment\u2019 \nin N Palmer and E MacKendrick (eds) Interests in Goods (London: LLP, 2nd edn, 1998) p 604 this \nrationalisation was simplified down to \u2018obvious reasons of policy\u2019.  Edwards and Stacey (discussed \nfurther below, text following n 100) involved the theft of three dead pigs that had been buried as they \nhad been bitten by a mad dog.  \n13 See eg Honor\u00e9, above n 11, p 123.  \n 6 \nenvironmental effect (ie pollution or rubbish),14 because \u2018the maintenance of the \nenvironment is a collective good.\u201915  This is particularly important for the bin-diving \nsituation.  A freegan takes goods that have been disposed of in order to re-use them \n(or in the case of foodstuffs, put to good initial use).  Otherwise, the goods would be \ndisposed in a manner that may well constitute an environmental cost,16 and thus bin-\ndiving is justifiable as a means of reducing the environmental impact of a consumer \nculture by increasing the efficient use of goods.17  However, this fails to fully deal \nwith cases where goods are disposed of because they are actually dangerous.  \nNevertheless, freegans will not be attempting to acquire goods that have been \ndisposed of because they are dangerous to health, on the contrary the underlying \nrationale of freeganism, and bin-diving specifically, is that the goods that have been \nthrown out are perfectly safe and usable.18  Freegans who bin-dive for food often \njustify their actions because food is often disposed of for what are essentially \neconomic or regulatory reasons, rather than specific health and safety reasons.  The \nfood may be aesthetically unappealing and thus unsellable whilst remaining perfectly \nedible, or it may have reached a pre-ordained \u2018sell-by date\u2019 whilst remaining safe to \neat.  The same logic would also apply to bin-diving for obsolete electronic goods, for \nexample.  Consequently, it could be said that the environmental argument against bin-\ndiving fails to justify a prohibition of the practice, and it could further be argued that \nthe environmental argument in favour of bin-diving is a valid one.19\n                                                 \n14 J E Penner The Idea of Property in Law (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1997) pp 79-80. \n  \n15 Ibid, 79. \n16 See generally Stuart, above n 4. \n17 See eg Hudson, \u2018Abandonment\u2019, above n 12, p 614. \n18 This issue, and the ones that follow in the main text, were all raised by Tristram Stuart, a freegan and \nauthor, in Skidelsky, above n 4.  \n19 It should be noted at this point that there is a specific offence of interfering with waste receptacles \nunder the Environmental Protection Act 1990, s 60.  However, as the focus of this article is the \nassessment of whether a freegan bin-diver commits the offence of theft, the s 60 offence can be \ndisregarded for the sake of economy and clarity.  It is worth noting though that the existence of a \nregulatory offence of this nature does not demonstrate that the environmental justifications for bin-\n 7 \n \nBin-diving may be objectionable on the grounds of privacy.  In Williams v Phillips,20 \nthe defendant was a refuse collector who had taken for himself an object he had found \nin a rubbish bin, and he was convicted of larceny.  This case is discussed in depth \nbelow,21 but it is worth noting at this point as Ormerod and Williams have argued that \nthat decision could be justified on the grounds of privacy.  \u2018The availability of theft \ncharges in such circumstances is important in dealing with those who rummage \nthrough the refuse of celebrities for information to sell to tabloid newspapers, and \nthose who appropriate confidential industrial or financial information from refuse.\u201922\n \n  \nYet this argument may well only cover cases of bin-diving from individuals\u2019 bins, as \nit is highly unlikely that a supermarket or restaurant will be disposing of information \nin the same bins they disposes of waste foodstuffs.  If there is a disposal of \ninformation, by accident or design, it is difficult to translate the aims of freegan bin-\ndiving \u2013 the acquisition and reuse of viable goods \u2013 into an urge to acquire \nconfidential information.    So even if a freegan acquired an obsolete computer which \nstill contained data, it is the goods\u2019 inherent \u201cuse-value\u201d which attracts the freegan, \nand the data would be an irrelevance.  The clear gulf between information and \ntangible goods means that the privacy argument cannot apply to cases of freegan bin-\ndiving. \n                                                                                                                                            \ndiving put forward by freegans are in any way incorrect.  It is, as is implied by the text accompanying \nthis footnote, a question of balance. \n20 (1957) 41 Cr App R 5. \n21 See text following n 103. \n22 D Ormerod and D H Williams Smith\u2019s Law of Theft (Oxford: OUP, 9th edn, 2007) (hereafter \n\u2018Smith\u2019s Law of Theft\u2019) [2.186] fn 312.  For an interesting discussion of this act of \u2018garbology\u2019 (a \nportmanteau of archaeology and garbage), see Scanlan, above n 7, pp 142-153. \n 8 \nThe privacy argument against taking rubbish from bins has been dealt with by the \nSupreme Court of the United States of America, in California v Greenwood.23  That \ncase involved an unwarranted search of Greenwood\u2019s rubbish, which had been \nwrapped in a plastic bag and deposited on the side of the street for collection by the \nrelevant authority.  Giving the opinion of the majority (by six to two, with one \nabstention) Justice White held that there was no need for a warrant to search rubbish \nleft in such a case.  He further stated that \u2018It is common knowledge that plastic \ngarbage bags left on or at the side of a public street are readily accessible to animals, \nchildren, scavengers, snoops, and other members of the public.\u201924\n \n  It is intuitive \u2013 a \n\u2018gut feeling\u2019 \u2013 that even though property has been placed in receptacles with the final \naim of disposal by authorities charged with such a task, such property has essentially \nbeen abandoned by the original owner.  As Hudson clearly puts it: \n\u2018The great advantage of recognising divesting abandonment, a point clearly \nappreciated by the Roman jurists, is that the law more closely coincides with \nthe ordinary person\u2019s realistic appreciation of the types of situation which \nbring it into play and, especially in criminal law, it avoids the need to contort \nthe law by providing devious explanations for non-liability in situations which \ncould more straightforwardly be called cases of divesting abandonment.\u201925\n \n \nIn a recent article in the Southern Daily Echo,26\n                                                 \n23 (1988) 486 US 35. \n two freegans based in the South of \nEngland were interviewed.

Furthermore, the effect of such \nfeelings is of particular importance for the question at the heart of this article: do \nfreegans commit theft?  As will be shown,29\n3. FREEGANISM AND THEFT \n the effect of the current law on \ndishonesty is such that the intuitive feelings of jury members, and of freegan bin-\ndivers themselves, can be determining factors in assessing whether a bin-diver is \ndishonest and thus whether he is guilty of theft.  As Hudson put it, the \u2018ordinary \nperson\u2019s realistic appreciation\u2019 is extremely significant when considering the \n(dis)honesty a freegan accused of stealing goods from a bin. \nFreeganism does not involve a transaction, such as a sale, between a freegan and the \nperson throwing out the rubbish.30\n                                                 \n27 A similar approach can be seen in a comment to an article on freeganism on the Telegraph website \n(\n  Therefore, questions over the ownership of the \ngoods concerned can quickly arise.

Two problems arise.  First, do the goods \ntaken by the freegan, ie rubbish, belong to another?  This requires analysis of the law \non abandonment.  Second, and perhaps more importantly, is a freegan dishonest?  \nThis article discusses these issues in depth. \nAt this juncture there is value in drawing the boundaries of this article.  The analysis \nof abandonment is dealt with initially in order to demonstrate the basic rule, that \nabandoned goods cannot be stolen.  It will be shown that abandonment depends on \nvarious factors, and that these factors effectively limit the freegan\u2019s ability to show \nthat the goods have been abandoned.  Furthermore, it will be shown that the issues of \nabandonment and dishonesty dovetail together in cases such as bin-diving.  This \nmoves the focus onto the issue of dishonesty, where it will be shown that a freegan \nhas a better chance of avoiding a theft conviction by claiming he was not being \ndishonest. \n                                                 \n34 Smith\u2019s Law of Theft [1.48].  This statement is clearly made in the context of whether the Fraud Act \n2006 will have an impact on the law of theft, but I believe it is an accurate description of theft. \n35 It is assumed for the sake of economy that the goods taken by freegans constitute property that can \nbe stolen under the provisions of the Theft Act 1968.   \n36 Simester and Sullivan, p 471.

From this abandonment can be defined: V has abandoned his goods when \nhe no longer has possession or control over them, or any proprietary right or interest \nin them. \n \n \nThe \u2018very purpose of criminalising theft\u2019 is to protect the owner of goods from the \nharm that results from a thief interfering with property rights and interests.39  This is a \nvital point.  If goods are abandoned, there is no possibility of a theft conviction.40  If \nthe \u2018thief\u2019 is the only person with any interest in the goods then he could not have \nstolen them.41  Instead the common-law rules of property acquisition will determine \nthe ownership of the abandoned goods: the goods will become the property of the \nperson who first repossesses them, ie the first person to reduce the goods to his \ncontrol.42\n                                                 \n38 For some reason it appears that there is an exponential growth in the literature on abandonment.

Whether the goods actually belong to another person is essential to an \nassessment of the criminal nature of freeganism.  As abandoned goods cannot be \nstolen, analysis of the abandonment concept is necessary.44\n \n   \nAllusions to the impossibility of abandonment exist,45 and abandonment can be \ndescribed as \u2018controverted\u2019.46  Nevertheless, there is a fundamental rational basis for \nthe existence of a concept of abandonment.  Penner argues that it must be part of the \nowner\u2019s right to determine the use of a thing for the owner to determine that the thing \nhas no use (it may of course be of use to a freegan), otherwise one is \u2018saddled with a \nrelationship to a thing that one does not want.\u201947  Strahilevitz takes Penner\u2019s argument \nfurther, noting that it is related to the right to destroy,48 and that the right to abandon \nis an example of State-backed guarantee along these lines: \u2018we will allow you to rid \nyourself of a resource regardless of what anyone else has to say about the matter.\u201949  \nFurthermore, it is clear that there is there is sufficient guidance from the case-law that \nabandonment is possible.50\n                                                 \n43 Smith\u2019s Law of Theft [2.11].  See also Griew [2.88].  That the actus reus of theft has disappeared is \nthe consequence of the decisions of the House of Lords in R v Morris [1984] AC 320; R v Gomez \n[1993] AC 442, 464; R v Hinks [2001] 2 AC 241.   \n  Thus it is taken as granted that abandonment is possible.  \n44 The necessity of analysing the common law rules concerning abandonment is clearly illustrated in \nHickey, above n 38. \n45 See eg Pollock and Wright, above n 42, p 124 (acquisition of goods can \u2018perhaps\u2019 occur following \nabandonment); Griffiths-Baker, above n 38. \n46 A P Bell The Modern Law of Personal Property in England and Ireland (London: Butterworths, \n1989) p 36 fn 1.

In the next section the various factors that affect whether goods are \nabandoned will be considered.51  These are the value of the goods, the owner\u2019s \nintention, the location of the goods, and the finder\u2019s intention.    The final factor \ndiscussed, the finder\u2019s intention, is important as it illustrates the dovetailing \nrelationship between the abandonment concept and the dishonesty element of the \noffence of theft, and more importantly, it will provide evidence for the argument that \na freegan\u2019s chances of avoiding a theft conviction depends more on his (dis)honesty \nthan whether the goods are abandoned.  Following that is a close analysis of the effect \nof abandonment by disposal as rubbish,52\n(i) Abandonment  \n because the disposal of goods as rubbish is \nprobably the fact-situation closest to the freeganist bin-diving scenario. \nAs Lord Goddard CJ has said, \u2018you cannot be charged with stealing abandoned \nproperty\u2019,53 but goods that are merely lost can be the subject of theft.54\n \n  Finding the \nboundary between abandonment and loss can be difficult not only in practice but also \nat a theoretical level, because various factors can determine the location of the \nboundary between abandonment and loss.  They are the value of the goods, the \nowner\u2019s intention, the location of the goods, and the finder\u2019s intention, and they shall \nbe considered in turn. \n                                                 \n51 3(a)(i)  Abandonment. \n52 3(a)(ii)  Abandonment by disposal as rubbish.  \n53 Ellerman\u2019s Wilson Line Limited v Webster [1952] 1 Lloyd\u2019s Rep 179, 180.   \n54 On loss generally see eg -- \u2018Possession of \u201cLost\u201d Goods\u2019 (1920) 20 Col L Rev 780-787; R W Aigler \n\u2018Rights of Finders\u2019 (1923) 21 Mich L Rev 664; D Reisman \u2018Possession and the Law of Finders\u2019 (1939) \n52 Harv L Rev 1105; M J Boyle and M Hecht \u2018The Return of Lost Property According to Jewish & \nCommon Law: A Comparison\u2019 (1995-1996) 12 J Law and Religion 225. \n 15 \nPollock and Wright describe abandonment as \u2018the case of a person quitting possession \nwithout any specific intention of putting another person in his place (a case naturally \nexceptional with things of value)\u2019.55  The words in parentheses are important.  The \ndifficulties regarding abandonment are in proportion to the value of the thing in \nquestion: it is much less likely that there can be an abandonment of a valuable thing \nthan of a less valuable thing.56\n \n   \nThere is considerable strength in the \u201cvalue of the goods\u201d approach to abandonment.57  \nIn R v Peters,58 a case concerning the abandonment of jewellery, Rolfe B was willing \nto hold that the likelihood of abandonment of something is relative to the value of the \nthing abandoned: \u2018If I had an apple, and dropped it, it might be presumed that I \nabandoned it; but if I drop \u00a3500, the presumption is, that I do not mean to abandon \nit.\u201959  Over a century later, in a civil case the Court of Appeal had to consider, in \nBentinck Ltd v Cromwell Engineering Co,60\n \n whether a car had been abandoned.  The \ncar had been acquired on hire-purchase, with the plaintiffs as financiers, and the \ndefendants (the employers of the person who acquired the car) had signed an \nindemnity agreement.  The car was damaged in a crash, and then taken to a garage, \nwhere it was left.  The hirer, a Mr Faulkner, then disappeared.  Lord Denning MR \nheld that the car had been abandoned.  He said the following: \n\u2018the abandonment, to entitle the finance company to retake possession, must \nbe abandonment of all rights in the car so as to evince quite clearly that the \n                                                 \n55 Pollock and Wright, above n 42, p 44. \n56 Ibid, p 44, p 183. \n57 See also Strahilevitz, above n 38, pp 5-6.  Strahilevitz takes into account the subjective value of the \ngoods as well as the market value. \n58 (1843) 1 Car & K 245, 247; 174 ER 795. \n59 Ibid, 247; 795. \n60 [1971] 1 QB 324. \n 16 \nhirer no longer has any interest in it.  The judge has so found in this case \u2026 \nThat seems to me to be a reasonable inference from the facts of this case.  \nHere was a car with all the costs running up.  Mr. Faulkner would not want to \nshoulder the liability.  He disappeared altogether.\u201961\n \n \nThis statement is a revealing one.  It could be argued that the fact that Mr Faulkner \nhad taken it upon himself to disappear was the true basis for finding that the property \nwas abandoned.  However, in much the same way that an individual can be the owner \nof goods even if he does not know of their immediate existence,62\n \n then an individual\u2019s \ndisappearance does not necessarily mean that all of that person\u2019s property is \nabandoned.  From a practical perspective, the opposite position would create a \nnightmare with regard to goods owned by people who disappear.  The italicised words \nclearly indicate the strongest grounds for the conclusion that the property had been \nabandoned: the value of the car had rapidly decreased compared to the costs of \nowning the car. \nThere is further support for this approach to understanding abandonment from the \nrecent decision of the Saskatchewan Court of Queen\u2019s Bench in Stewart v Gustafson, \nwhere Klebuc J stated that \u2018an intention to abandon can be inferred from the very \n                                                 \n61 Ibid, 328-329 (emphasis added).  The other judges, Fenton Atkinson LJ, and Cairns LJ, both agreed \nwith Lord Denning MR (at 329 of the report).  The Court of Appeal decision in Dee Conservancy \nBoard v McConnell [1928] 2 KB 159 appears at first sight to provide a very strict standard for the \nreasoning adopted by Lord Denning MR.  In the earlier case Scrutton LJ (at 163-164) said that if he \ncrashed his car onto someone\u2019s lawn thus blocking their drive, because of his negligent driving, \u2018[i]t \nwill be no answer to the claim by that person for the damage done to his lawn and the blocking of his \ndrive, and for the expense incurred by him in removing the motor car which I had not removed, for me \nto say: \u201cI abandon the car.\u201d\u2019  However, the Dee Conservancy Board case concerned the law of wreck \n(which as Hudson has twice noted (see above n 12) provides an idiosyncratic set of rules on \nabandonment), and so can be distinguished.  Furthermore, the situation in Bentinck was substantially \ndifferent as the abandoned car had not caused loss to a third party nor was it causing further loss. \n62 See below, text accompanying n 72 \u2013 n 74. \n 17 \nnature of a chattel.\u201963  In that case, there was a quantity of lumber under dispute.  The \nlumber was \u2018worthless\u2019, and Klebuc J held that the finder was \u2018entitled to infer that \n[the owner] had abandoned these chattels because of their character.\u201964\n \n   \nThis approach has substantial significance for freegans, and in particular those \nfreegans who engage in bin-diving for foodstuffs outside shops and restaurants.  Such \ngoods are disposed of into bins by their owners because they have no economic value \n\u2013 if the goods have reached their sell-by date then their economic value has essentially \nreduced down to zero because they cannot be sold.  Bin-diving for foodstuffs is not \nthe sole occupation of a freegan,65 but there is no reason why non-foodstuffs cannot \nalso be subject to this \u201cvalue of the goods\u201d approach.  If the goods concerned are no \nlonger economically viable, say through technological obsolescence, it is that basic \nfact which leads to their abandonment.  It is further suggested that the value of the \ngoods approach is in accordance with the intuitive feeling that people can have with \nregard to goods thrown away into bins \u2013 that rubbish has no value.66\n \n \nNevertheless, problems can arise for the bin-diver as the value of the goods approach \ndoes not cover all possible bin-diving scenarios.  What if the disputed goods are not \ncompletely economically worthless?  What if they are worthless, but retain some \nother (sentimental) value?  What if the goods have been disposed of by accident?   \n \n                                                 \n63 [1999] 4 WWR 696 [38]. \n64 Ibid.  See also, at [21]: \u2018As the practical or monetary value of a chattel increases, so in my view does \nthe difficulty of inferring abandonment\u2019.  See also Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Co v Lehigh Valley Coal \nCo 143 A 474 (Penn 1928). \n65 See above, text following n 6. \n66 See above, text following n 23. \n 18 \nThese questions can be dealt with by considering the intention of the owner.  If an \nowner intends to abandon the problems seem to dissipate, but if there is no such \nintention, and the owner merely regards the goods as lost, then the goods will not be \nconsidered abandoned.  The following definition of abandonment given by Simester \nand Sullivan is particularly helpful here: \u2018Abandonment of ownership requires a \ngiving up of the owner\u2019s physical control of an item, accompanied by the cessation of \nany intention to possess that item and of any intention to exclude other persons from \nits possession \u2013 ie a deliberate relinquishing of all rights over the item.\u201967  This \naccords with the negative interpretation of the concept of \u2018belonging to another\u2019, \nnoted above.68  Generally the loss of possession will be relatively easy to \ndemonstrate.  However, proving the owner had the necessary intention to give up the \nrights in the goods is a far more difficult task, particularly bearing in mind that it has \nnot been determined with any certainty whether this intention is assessed subjectively \nor objectively.69\n \n   \nIn R v Woodman,70\n                                                 \n67 Simester and Sullivan, pp 457 (emphasis added).  See also Smith\u2019s Law of Theft [2.186]: \u2018If [the \nowner] intends to exclude others from [the goods], he does not abandon it, though it may be clear that \nhe intends to make no further use of it himself.\u2019   \n a company owned a site and the contents of that site.  They left the \nsite, and gave the Bird group of companies the right to remove metal from the site.  \nThe Bird group did so, but left behind some metal it deemed uneconomic to remove.  \nThe company then secured the site with fencing, and put up a notice prohibiting \ntrespassers.  The defendant then came along some two years later, entered the site, \nand took the remaining metal.  He was convicted of theft, and appealed on the basis \nthat the company which had run the site could not be said to be in control of the \n68 See above, text following n 38. \n69 K Gray and S F Gray Elements of Land Law (Oxford: OUP, 5th edn, 2009) [1.2.78]. \n70 [1974] QB 754. \n 19 \nproperty as they had been under the impression it had all been removed by the Bird \ngroup.  The Court of Appeal disagreed, holding that the control of the site sufficed to \nshow that goods on the site belonged to the company, notwithstanding the company\u2019s \nignorance of their existence.71\n \n \nThis is not particularly controversial: it is a longstanding principle of property law \nthat a person can own property that he does not know of.72  As Pollock states: \u2018though \nan occupier may have no conscious specific intention concerning all the chattels in his \nhouse, or on his land, it is certainly his general intention that unauthorized persons \nshall not meddle with them.\u201973  What the Woodman decision demonstrates is that \nwhilst an owner can abandon the physical possession without maintaining the \nintention to retain ownership, and this retained intention will remain overriding: \u2018The \nfact that it could not be shown that [the owners of the site] were conscious of the \nexistence of this or any particular scrap iron does not destroy the general principle that \ncontrol of a site by excluding others from it is prima facie control of articles on the \nsite as well.\u201974\n \n   \nAn owner of land can have the necessary intent to control goods on said land, so as to \nprevent the finding of abandonment, but the nature of the owner\u2019s control of the land \nis an important factor in assessing whether the land owner has the necessary intent to \ncontrol goods.  Two situations can be disposed of quickly.

In such cases the landowner has two options.  They can restrict public access to \nthe land: obviously if no-one can access the land, then the goods cannot be reduced \ninto the possession of another.77  Parker v British Airways Board provides the other \noption for landowners: express a manifest intention to exclude others.78\n \n  So whether \nor not the land on which the goods lay is open to public access will determine the \nstrength of the claim of the occupier; if there is public access then the occupier has to \ndisplay a manifest intention to possess all goods on the land. \nThe clarity of this approach to determining ownership masks an underlying conflict of \nprinciples.  A balance must be drawn between the principle that the owner of land \nintends to own all the goods on that land, and the principle that property in goods is \ninitially deemed to lie with the finder.  The problem of finding an appropriate balance \nbetween these principles is illustrated by the different approaches in R v William \nRowe,79 and R v William White.80\n                                                 \n75 See eg South Staffordshire Water Co v Sharman [1896] 2 QB 44; The Title of the Finder (1899) 33 \nILT 225; Wiley v Synan (1937) 57 CLR 200; Grafstein v Holme [1958] 12 DLR (2d) 727. \n  In Rowe it was held that a canal company had \nproperty in iron that had lain on the bottom of the canal for some time, on the basis of \nthe general principle that land owners own all goods on their land.

The Court of Criminal Appeal \nquashed a conviction for stealing pig iron, which had been found on the side of a \n76 See eg Elwes v Brigg Gas Company (1886) 33 ChD 562; South Staffordshire Water Co v Sharman \n[1896] 2 QB 44; City of London Corporation v Appleyard [1963] 2 All RE 834; Moffatt v Kazana \n[1969] 2 QB 152; Waverley BC v Fletcher [1996] QB 334; Gray and Gray, above n 69, [1.2.70]-\n[1.2.71]. \n77 See eg R v Woodman [1974] QB 754; Simester and Sullivan, p 458. \n78 [1982] QB 1004.

It was said that if the iron \u2018had been at some time in the bed of the canal it may \nwell have been abandoned by the owner\u2019.81  Lord Alverstone CJ acknowledged the \nchallenge that courts face: that fact that goods are simply lying on the ground as much \ndemonstrates that such goods are abandoned as it demonstrates their mere loss.82  The \ndistinctions between the cases extend, importantly, to the grounds for appeal in either \ncase.  In Rowe the task for the Court was to determine whether the canal company had \na sufficient interest in the goods to maintain an indictment for larceny, whereas in \nWilliam White the focus was on whether the finder had sufficient intention to be \nconvicted.83  Thus in William White it was said that if \u2018the property had been \nabandoned, the person charged has a right to have the jury directed that if he took it \nreally believing that it was abandoned, he is not guilty of larceny.\u201984\n \n  This illustrates \nthat the real problem for finders charged with theft is not necessarily whether the \nproperty is abandoned.  Rather, the issue is whether or not the finder is honest, based \non his actual belief. \nThe importance of a finder\u2019s belief or honesty is evident in the decisions in Hibbert v \nMcKiernan,85 and R v Rostron.86\n                                                 \n81 Ibid, 268. \n  In Hibbert the defendant had been arrested at a golf \nclub and was found to be in possession of eight golf balls, which he had picked up on \nthe course.  One of the balls had a distinctive mark which corresponded to a ball lost \nby a member of the club three days previously.  The defendant was charged with theft \ncontrary to section 2 of the Larceny Act 1916.

See generally R Hickey \u2018Stealing abandoned goods: possessory title in \nproceedings for theft\u2019 (2006) 26 LS 584. \n 22 \nconviction was upheld.  Lord Goddard CJ stated that the Court \u2018need not be troubled \nwith nice questions\u2019 relating to ownership.87  Hickey rightly argues that such an \napproach is mistaken, and that the best interpretation of this case is the simplest one: \nthat the members of the club had sufficient possessory interest to maintain a charge of \nlarceny.88  However, the facts of this case and the tenor of the judgements of Lord \nGoddard CJ and Humphreys J also indicate the importance of the defendant\u2019s \nintention, with particular reference to the absence of claim of right on the part of the \ndefendant.  In the headnote to the King\u2019s Bench Reports, it is stated that the defendant \n\u2018stated that he knew he had no right to take them\u2019.89\n \n  Lord Goddard CJ said that the \nCourt was  \n\u2018dealing with \u2026 a thief who took the balls animo furandi; not with a honest \nman \u2026 Every householder or occupier of land means or intends to exclude \nthieves and wrongdoers from the property occupied by him, and this confers \non him a special property in goods found on his land sufficient to support an \nindictment if the goods are taken therefrom, not under a claim of right, but \nwith a felonious intent.\u201990\n \n \nHumphreys J provided a similar rationale: \n \n\u2018the appellant, after giving a false name and address and denying that he was \nin possession of any golf balls, had when found in possession of eight of them \nadmitted that he knew he had no right to take them.  He therefore, as the \n                                                 \n87 [1948] 2 KB 142, 149. \n88 Hickey, above n 86, pp 589-593.  This was evidenced by the club employing a police constable to \nmonitor the course to ward off trespassers and those who would take lost balls: [1948] 2 KB 142, 144. \n89 [1948] 2 KB 142, 143. \n90 Ibid, 149-50 (emphasis added). \n 23 \njustices found, acted fraudulently, without any claim of right and with the \nintention of permanently depriving the owners of their property.\u201991\n \n   \nIn Rostron, the defendants had been caught by the police, dressed in scuba diving \ngear, with a bag of \u2018very wet golf balls.\u201992  They had used their diving experience to \ncollect golf balls that had been lost into water hazards, apparently earning up to \n\u00a330,000 a year from selling such balls.93  As Hickey has noted, the Court of Appeal in \nRostron failed to take into account certain material differences of fact between the \ncase before them and Hibbert (which they took as governing the situation).94  That \nanalysis is not disputed.  However, it is further suggested that as with Hibbert the \ndefendants in Rostron had their convictions upheld as much by reference to their \ndishonesty as by reference to the proprietary status of the balls.  The defendants \nclaimed the golf balls they had were in fact taken from a golf course in Lancashire \n(rather than the one they were at, in Leicester),95\n \n clearly demonstrating an evasive \nattitude on the defendants\u2019 part, if not outright dishonesty.  Mantell LJ (giving the sole \njudgement of the Court) considered the issue of honesty.  He stated it was sufficient \n(indeed, \u2018more favourable than it needed to be\u2019) to tell the jury (as the trial judge had)  \n\u2018that the prosecution had to prove that the defendant whose case was being \nconsidered knew that he was not entitled to go on to the golf course and \nremove golf balls.  If that was established, then the necessary element of \ndishonesty had been proved, and, of course, if that were the case it would \nmatter not what other people might think, because he could not in such \n                                                 \n91 Ibid, 151 (emphasis added). \n92 [2003] EWCA Crim 2206 [1] (Mantell LJ). \n93 Noted in Smith\u2019s Law of Theft [2.206]. \n94 Hickey, above n 86, pp 598-600. \n95 [2003] EWCA Crim 2206 [3]. \n 24 \ncircumstances have had an honest belief that he was entitled to do what he \ndid.\u201996\n \n \nHooper and Ormeord have noted that the fact the defendant in Rostron had \n\u2018knowledge that he had no \u201cright\u201d (and no permission) to act in this way merely \nmeant he had no possible defence under\u2019 sections 2(1)(a) and 2(1)(b) [ie those relating \nto a claim of right].\u2019  Indeed, the fact the defendant \u2018also argued that he saw no harm \nin fishing for the balls, given that nobody else seemed interested in recovering them, \nand this surely entitled him to a Ghosh direction, especially since his case appears to \nhave elicited considerable public sympathy at the time.\u201997  In commenting on Hibbert \nv McKiernan, Griew noted that \u2018Such a scavenger no doubt steals under the present \nlaw.  But the club\u2019s \u201ccontrol\u201d of the balls within the meaning of section 5(1) can \nhardly depend on the fact of trespass.\u201998  Yet for Mantell LJ the fact of trespass \nappears to have been conclusive of the issue.  The fact of trespass (in addition to the \nmisleading statements by the defendants at the time of their arrest) meant that the \ndefendants\u2019 belief about the abandoned nature of the golf balls was not an honest one.  \nThus it becomes clear that in assessing whether theft has occurred, the issue of \nabandonment can go as much to the intention element of the offence as it does to any \nother.  This is of particular importance for freegan bin-divers, as it begins to illustrate \nthe effect of their belief about the proprietary status of the goods they find in bins.  \nThis issue of dishonesty is analysed further below.99\n                                                 \n96 Ibid, [19]. \n \n97 Lord Justice Hooper and D Ormerod (Gen Eds) Blackstone\u2019s Criminal Practice 2008 (Oxford: OUP, \n18th edn, 2007) [B4.37]. \n98 Griew [2.29]. \n99 3(b) Dishonesty. \n 25 \n(ii) Abandonment by disposal as rubbish \nIn R v Edwards and Stacey,100 three pigs had been bitten by a mad dog and in order to \nprevent the pork entering the food chain the owner of the pigs ordered two of his \nemployees to bury the pigs.  However, they later dug up the carcasses and disposed of \nthem for their own profit.  It was held that the pigs had not been abandoned, and so \nthey were convicted of larceny.  The rationale behind this conclusion appears to have \ntwo elements.  First, the owner demonstrated an intention to retain control over the \ngoods, and second, the public policy ground of preventing risks to public health.101  \nThese aspects of the case separate it from freegan bin-diving, as owners of rubbish \ngenerally do not demonstrate an intention to retain control over the goods, and the \nrisks to public health from bin-diving are minimal.102\n \n \nIn Williams v Phillips,103\n \n the defendants were refuse-collectors working for the local \nauthority.  They appropriated property that had been placed in bins as rubbish for \ncollection by the authority.  Their conviction for larceny was upheld.  According to \nthe Court of Appeal, the owners had put the rubbish in the bins with the specific \nintention of transferring the property in the rubbish to the authority (presumably upon \ncollection by the authority).  That was the only allowable interference with the \nrubbish, thus the goods were not abandoned.  Lord Goddard CJ stated that putting \nrubbish out for collection was not abandonment.  His speech is worth referring to in \nfull: \n                                                 \n100 (1877) 13 Cox CC 384; 466 LT 30; 41 JP 212. \n101 See eg A H Hudson, \u2018Is Divesting Abandonment Possible at Common Law?\u2019 (1984) 100 LQR 110, \n115 fn 42, noted above n 12. \n102 See above, text accompanying n 10. \n103 (1957) 41 Cr App R 5. \n 26 \n\u2018If I put refuse in my dustbin outside my house, I am not abandoning it in the \nsense that I am leaving it for anybody to take it away.  I am putting it out so \nthat it may be collected and taken away by the local authority, and until it has \nbeen taken away by the local authority it is my property.  It is my property and \nI can take it back and prevent anybody else from taking it away.  It is simply \nput there for the Corporation or the local authority, as the case may be, to \ncome and clear it away.  Once the Corporation come and clear it away, it \nseems to me that because I intended it to pass from myself to them, it becomes \ntheir property.  Therefore, there is no ground for saying that this is abandoned \nproperty.  As long as the property remains on the owner\u2019s premises, it cannot \nbe abandoned property.  It is a wholly untenable proposition to say that refuse \nwhich a householder puts out to be taken away is abandoned.  Very likely he \ndoes not want it himself and that is why he puts it in the dustbin.  He puts it in \nthe dustbin, not so that anybody can come along and take it, but so that the \nCorporation can come along and take it.\u2019104\n \n \nThus Reed and Fitzpatrick state that  \n \n\u2018where householders throw rubbish into a dustbin for collection by the \ncorporation, they have in a sense abandoned the property; but not for the \npurposes of theft.  This does not give the public the right to rummage through \nthe bin to see if there is anything worth taking.  Thus even in a situation where \nthe householder is expected to place his dustbin in the street outside his house \n                                                 \n104 Ibid, 8. \n 27 \nfor collection, if X, a passerby, or even the dustman, takes anything from the \nbin there is a prima facie case of theft from the householder.\u2019105\n \n   \nHudson provides an even broader interpretation, arguing that when someone puts \nrubbish in a bin the rubbish \u2018is intended for the local authority and the householder \ncan take it back and prevent anyone else taking it away.\u2019106  This certainly it locks in \nthe notion that abandonment is not something to be \u2018lightly inferred\u2019.107\n \n  Furthermore, \nit is arguable that the functional similarity between freegan bin-diving and the actions \nof the defendant in Williams v Phillips is so great (greater than the similarity with \nEdwards and Stacey) that by reason of analogy freegans must be guilty of theft.  It is \nsuggested though that such an argument is mistaken. \nAs was noted at the outset of this article,108\n                                                 \n105 A Reed and B Fitzpatrick Criminal Law (London: Sweet & Maxwell, 3rd edn, 2006) 444.  In \nWilliams v Phillips, although the householder had not abandoned property by throwing out the rubbish, \nthe basis of the conviction was that there was a theft against the employer (ie the local authority that \ncollected the rubbish) and not against the householder. \n the arguments on environmental or \nprivacy grounds fail to properly cover freegan bin-diving.  Thus, like with Edwards \nand Stacey, Williams v Phillips does not provide satisfactory grounds for convicting \nfreegan bin-divers of theft if the decision is predicated on privacy concerns.  Perhaps \nmore importantly, in both cases the decisions appeared to be predicated on the \nparticular status of the defendants as employees.  In Edwards and Stacey they were \nspecifically ordered by their employer not to dig up the pig carcass.  In Williams v \nPhillips the defendants were contracted (via an agreement between the union of which \nthey were members and the employing authority) to give up any items found in the \nrubbish to their employer to be divided equally between the employer and employees.  \n106 A H Hudson \u2018Is Divesting Abandonment Possible at Common Law?\u2019 (1984) 100 LQR 110, 115. \n107 Smith and Hogan, p 778. \n108 See above, text following n 12. \n 28 \nThey were also informed that failure to follow this condition would lead to criminal \nprosecution.  So in doing the particular acts the defendants in both cases were \ndeliberately and knowingly going outside their authority and breaching expressly-\nstated conditions set out by their employers.109\n \n  However, freeganism appears to rest \non a different set of circumstances.  A freegan will be obtaining property that he \nbelieves is abandoned; he has not been specifically told that he cannot take the \nproperty as his own.  It is arguable that neither case provides conclusive guidance as \nto the criminal liability of a freegan. \nIt could thus be suggested that if someone wishes to avoid their rubbish being seen as \nabandoned and then taken by a freegan, they should simply imposes clear notices \n(perhaps following Lord Denning\u2019s \u2018red hand\u2019 test110\n                                                 \n109 This links in to the principle that property found by an employee belongs to the employer.  See \nabove, n \n) that the goods in the bins is not \nin fact abandoned and that no one (apart from the collection agency) has a right to the \ngoods.  In such cases there will be a sufficiently manifested intention to exclude \nothers as to show that there is no abandonment.  Yet a freegan may still have \ndifficulty in proving the goods were abandoned in the absence of such labelling.  \nAlthough there are strong arguments in favour of allowing bin-diving, and the \narguments in favour criminalising of bin-diving are based on factors that are either not \npresent or are irrelevant to the case of a freegan bin-diver, the case law on \nabandonment is too opaque to allow for a clear assessment of the criminal status of a \nfreegan bin-diver.  If a freegan takes goods out of bin that is found at the back of a \nbuilding, regardless of whether the building contains a supermarket, restaurant, \nprivate house or offices, it is possible that the goods have not been abandoned.  The \n75 and accompanying text. \n110 Thornton v Shoe Lane Parking Ltd [1971] 2 QB 163, 170: \u2018In order to give sufficient notice, it \nwould need to be printed in red ink with a red hand pointing to it - or something equally startling.\u2019 \n 29 \ndecisions in Edwards and Stacey, Williams v Phillips, Woodman, and Parker v British \nAirways Board, Hibbert v McKiernan and Rostron all seem to suggest (for various \nreasons) that a bin-diver would be liable for theft in such a situation.  However, the \nfact the goods have been thrown out as rubbish may bring in the powerful argument \nabout value, illustrated in cases such as Peters, Bentinck Ltd v Cromwell Engineering \nCo and Stewart v Gustafson.  Most importantly though, the conflict between the \ndecisions in Rowe and William White, seen in the light of Hibbert v McKiernan and \nRostron, indicates that the fundamental issue is the freegan\u2019s intention; his honest \nbelief.  It seems that the best approach for a freegan bin-diver is to cast doubt on his \ndishonesty, rather than attempt the conceptually and practically difficult task of \nproving the goods were actually abandoned. \n(b) Dishonesty111\nAlthough the concept of dishonesty has a major role in determining whether theft has \nbeen committed,\n \n112 it is \u2018peculiarly difficult to define\u2019.113\n                                                 \n111 See eg Smith\u2019s Law of Theft [2.269] et seq; Simester and Sullivan, p 489 et seq; Smith and Hogan, p \n779 et seq; A Halpin Definition in the Criminal Law (Oxford: Hart Publishing, 2004) pp 149 et seq; \nLaw Commission \u2018Fraud\u2019 (Law Com No 276, 2002) part V: The Role of Dishonesty in the Criminal \nLaw; Griew [2.120]-[2.142]; E Griew \u2018Dishonesty: The Objections to Feely and Ghosh\u2019 [1985] Crim \nLR 341; D W Elliott \u2018Dishonesty in Theft: A dispensable concept\u2019 [1982] Crim LR 395. \n  The Theft Act 1968 only \nprovides examples of what is not dishonest.  Section 2 of that Act provides that an act \nis not dishonest if there is (1) appropriation in the belief that you have in law the right \nto deprive the owner of the goods, (2) appropriation in the belief that the owner would \nconsent if he knew of the appropriation and the surrounding circumstances, and (3) \n112 Law Commission \u2018Legislating the Criminal Code: Fraud and Deception\u2019 (Law Com No 155, 1999) \npart III, [3.24]: it is the \u2018principal determinant of criminality\u2019.

This question assumes \ngreater significance in the light of the difficulties faced by a freegan who claims \nmerely that the goods were abandoned.  So although \u2018the immunity accorded to the \npure finder appears to rest upon the ground of reasonable and probable cause of \nbelief\u2019,114 particular problems arise from the awkward fact that whilst a freegan\u2019s \nconduct may provide inferences about his level of honesty, it is the freegan\u2019s state of \nmind upon which his level of honesty must rest.115  Furthermore this assessment of \nthe freegan\u2019s state of mind is affected by the operation of dishonesty as a \u2018concept \ndescribing the wrong done (requiring a moral evaluation from the jury)\u2019.116\n \n  \nNevertheless, it is suggested that a careful analysis of freeganism and the \njurisprudence on dishonesty indicates that freegans are not dishonest. \nThe following discussion will consider the specific situation of a freegan bin-diver.  \nThere is an assessment of whether a freegan can protect himself by setting up a claim \nof right, which requires a discussion of the potential effects of a moral claim as \nopposed to a legal claim of right.117\n                                                 \n114 F Pollock and R S Wright An Essay on Possession in the Common Law (Oxford: OUP) p 183. \n  Next there is consideration of whether a freegan \n115 Smith\u2019s Law of Theft [2.271]. \n116 Ibid, [2.273]. \n117 3(b)(i) Belief in the right to deprive. \n 31 \nbin-diver can argue that he had an honest belief that he had the owner\u2019s consent.118  \nThis element of the discussion will be shown to be strongly correlated to the presence \nof a belief in whether the goods have been abandoned.  There will be a brief analysis \nof the potential of a claim that the owner of goods cannot be discovered, which will \nnecessarily be focused on freegan bin-diving of public bins.119  The final aspect of the \ndiscussion will consider the implications of the Ghosh test for dishonesty,120\n(i) Belief in the right to deprive \n where it \nwill be shown that the Ghosh test provides a valuable method by which a freegan can \navoid a theft conviction.  It will be shown that in the context of a freegan bin-diver, \nmany of the doubts about the Ghosh test famously raised by Edward Griew are \nultimately not objectionable, and that the strongest conclusion is that freegan bin-\ndivers are neither objectively nor subjectively dishonest. \nIf a defendant in a theft case has appropriated the goods \u2018in the belief that he has in \nlaw the right to deprive the other of it\u2019, it is not a dishonest appropriation.121  As \nstated, the right must be a legal right,122 not just a moral one.123  The need for a belief \nin a legal right appears to derive from the general principle that taking property \nwithout consent is unjustifiable even if done to prevent starvation.124  The belief in a \nlegal right does not have to be reasonable or even exist though;125\n                                                 \n118 \n an honest belief \n3(b)(ii) Belief that the owner consents. \n119 3(b)(iii) Belief that the owner cannot be found using reasonable means. \n120 3(b)(iv) The Ghosh test. \n121 Theft Act 1968, s 2(1)(a). \n122 Any right in law (and presumably in equity also) will do, not just property rights: Wood [1999] Crim \nL R 564. \n123 Harris v Harrison [1963] Crim LR 497. \n124 See eg M Hale History of the Pleas of the Crown (London, 1800) vol I, p 54; Southwark London \nBorough Council v Williams [1971] Ch 734, 744 (Lord Denning MR). \n125 See eg Bernhard [1938] 2 KB 264; Terry [2001] EWCA Crim 2979.  Cf Gott v Measures [1948] 1 \nKB 234.  See Griew [2.125]: if the defendant has an honest belief in the right to deprive there is no \n 32 \nwill suffice (and this is so for the other two \u201cbelief\u201d defences discussed below), \nalthough it must be accepted that the reasonableness of the belief could impact upon \nthe honesty of the belief.126\n \n   \nIt is suggested that a freegan could argue (for example) that the United Kingdom\u2019s \ninternational treaty obligations concerning environmental protection give them the \nright to reduce the impact of waste.  In September 2008 a number of Greenpeace \nprotestors were charged with causing criminal damage by painting on a chimney stack \nin protest at the Prime Minister\u2019s alleged failure to deal with environmental issues.127\n \n  \nIn that case the issue was whether the protestors had a \u2018lawful excuse\u2019 as per the \nCriminal Damage Act 1971, s 1(1), rather than whether they were dishonest.  \nNevertheless, there appears to be a functional similarity between the two defences, \nand the acquittal of the Greenpeace protestors raises the possibility that a jury may be \nswayed by a freegan claiming that his bin-diving activities were in fact based on a \nlegal right to prevent environmental harm. \nOther claims of a right to deprive the owner of the goods may arise, yet they may just \nbe moral rights.  Will such claims have any effect?  For one, a freegan may claim that \nhe has a right to take the goods on general environmental grounds (as opposed to the \nspecific legal obligations as noted above).  The environmentalist rationale for \nfreeganism would appear to bear this out as a strong possibility.128\n                                                                                                                                            \ndishonesty, even if the claim of right is unknown to the law (citing G Williams Criminal Law: The \nGeneral Part (London: Stevens & Son, 2nd edn, 1961) pp 321-325). \n  Alternatively, as \nHudson has argued, where \u2018an owner who has for all practical purposes abandoned his \nproperty [and] then [changes] his mind and [seeks] to recover it \u201cwhen he will\u201d, [there \n126 R v Wood [2002] EWCA Crim 832 [25], following R v Small [1987] Crim LR 777. \n127 See http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/england\/kent\/7608054.stm. \n128 See above, text following n 12. \n 33 \nis an infliction of] injustice on occupants who might have had very good reason to \nsuppose that the property was abandoned and good moral right to treat it as theirs.\u2019129  \nClearly the strict statutory restriction of such claims to legal rights would appear to \nmake either claim irrelevant.  Yet common sense strongly suggests that a freegan \nmaking a moral claim should not automatically be deemed dishonest.  Arguments as \nto belief in moral rights may well become important if the freegan bin-diver claims \nthat he honestly believed that what he was doing was not dishonest because of those \nbeliefs in moral rights.  Such a dispute would be solved by recourse to the Ghosh test \nfor dishonesty, discussed below.130  Thus it is arguable that a belief in a mere moral \nright is \u2018not necessarily\u2019 excluded,131 because the use of juries to determine \ndishonesty.  Jurors may well be swayed by the effect of such honest beliefs, and thus \nbelief in a moral right may achieve the same status as a belief in a legal right, but via a \ndifferent test for (dis)honesty.132\n(ii) Belief that the owner consents \n   \nIf a freegan were to take goods \u2018in the belief that he would have the other\u2019s consent if \nthe other knew of the appropriation and the circumstances of it\u2019, then he would not be \ndishonest.133  The aim of this provision is to preclude \u2018silly prosecutions\u2019, such as \nwhere someone takes their flatmate\u2019s milk for a cup of tea.134\n                                                 \n129 A H Hudson \u2018Abandonment\u2019 in N Palmer and E MacKendrick (eds) Interests in Goods (London: \nLLP, 2nd edn, 1998) pp 613-614. \n  It seems obvious that \nsomeone who throws out rubbish will not care about whether it is picked up by \n130 3(b)(iv) The Ghosh test. \n131 Smith\u2019s Law of Theft [2.277]. \n132 Ibid, [2.276]-[2.277]. \n133 Theft Act 1968, s 2(1)(b). \n134 Smith\u2019s Law of Theft [2.280]. \n 34 \nsomeone else.135\n \n  A freegan bin-diver may believe that since the original owner has \ndisposed of the goods as rubbish, then that owner would consent to anyone (thus \nincluding the freegan) taking the goods away.  Ease of access to the bin, and the ease \nof entry into the bin, will be determining factors in the assessment of whether the \nbelief is a genuine one, in the sense that a freegan who sees a bin with a big red cross \nand a sign saying \u2018keep out\u2019 will have difficulty in developing the necessary genuine \nbelief in consent.  What this illustrates is a connection between the tests for ownership \nand dishonesty in the offence of theft: those factors which determine whether or not \ngoods are considered abandoned will also help determine the presence of dishonesty. \nAn interesting problem may arise if a freegan claims the benefit of this defence on the \ngrounds that the owner of the goods in the bin (say, a supermarket) stated that whilst \nit would consent to its waste goods being taken by a freegan, it would not consent to a \nfreegan taking them from the bin itself.  This claim by the owner may well be \njustifiable as an expression of a risk-management policy with regard to liability \nshould a freegan get injured in the course of the bin-diving.  This situation may \npresent an insurmountable challenge for a freegan, as his practical experience as a \nbin-diver will no doubt have demonstrated to him at least the potential for injury, and \nthus a jury may conclude that this amount of knowledge would suffice to show that \nhis belief that the owner would consent was not an honest belief.   \n                                                 \n135 See above, text accompanying n 23.  The owner may have concerns if the rubbish contained \nconfidential information, though as noted earlier (see above, text accompanying n 20) this issue will \nnot arise in the case of a freegan bin-diver. \n 35 \n(iii) Belief that the owner cannot be found using \nreasonable means \nIf a freegan \u2018appropriates the property in the belief that the person to whom the \nproperty belongs cannot be discovered by taking reasonable steps\u2019 then he will be not \nbe dishonest.136  An honest belief will suffice: it does not need to be reasonable.137\n \n  \nThis defence will, prima facie, be of little use for a freegan who obtains goods by bin-\ndiving.  In such cases, whether the bin belongs to an individual or a commercial \norganisation, it seems implausible that unreasonable means would be required to find \nthe owner of property placed in such bins.  An individual\u2019s bin, with a house number \non it for example, or a supermarket\u2019s bin, located on the premises, will clearly signal \nthe identity of the person who put the goods in the bin.  Really in such cases a freegan \nclaiming that he is not dishonest will be best placed to found his argument on a \ndifferent aspect of the law on dishonesty.   \nHowever, when the situation involves \u2018unidentifiable\u2019 goods a freegan may well be \nable to effectively bring up this defence.  This may well be the case with regard to \nrubbish found in a public bin (or rubbish found lying on land).  To find out who the \n\u2018owner\u2019 is in such cases may well involve unreasonable means.  As Ormerod and \nWilliams have noted, the application and interpretation of this provision depends \nheavily on the particular circumstances of the case.138\n                                                 \n136 Theft Act 1968, s 2(1)(c). \n  Certainly, in the old case of R v \nThurborn, where the issue concerned the reasonableness of the finder\u2019s belief that the \nowner of a bank note could be found, \u2018evidence of [the finder\u2019s] previous \n137 Smith\u2019s Law of Theft [2.284]. \n138 Smith\u2019s Law of Theft [2.282], [2.284]. \n 36 \nacquaintance with the ownership of the particular chattel, the place where it is found, \nor the nature of the marks upon it\u2019 would be in point.139  Although the modern law \nimposes merely an honesty test on the belief, such factors would affect whether the \nfinding of the owner would require unreasonable means.  The presence of identifying \nmarks would suggest that identification of the owner could be reasonably achieved.  \nHowever, it could be argued that the idea of the finders \u2018previous acquaintance with \nthe ownership\u2019 of the goods can be interpreted as allowing a freegan to argue that \nbecause he had an honest belief that the goods were abandoned, he also honestly \nbelieved that identification of the owner would be unreasonable.  This argument could \nrest on the \u201cvalue of the goods\u201d approach to determining whether goods are \nabandoned,140\n(iv) The Ghosh test \n as the reasonableness of means used to find the owner will be inversely \nrelated to the value of the goods.  Thus a freegan could argue that the presence of the \ngoods in the bin demonstrates their low value, and the difference between the low \nvalue of the goods and the high cost of finding an owner would make such action \nunreasonable.  \nIn Feely,141 the Court of Appeal held that if the accused acted in a way which \noffended the sensibilities of the ordinary decent person,142 he would be dishonest.  \nThis test was expanded by the Court of Appeal in Ghosh:143\n                                                 \n139 (1848) 1 Den 387, 396; 169 ER 293, 297 (Parke B). \n in addition to the Feely \ntest, if the accused honestly believed that his actions were not dishonest according to \n140 See above, text following n 55. \n141 [1973] QB 530. \n142 In doing so there was a move away from the notion that dishonesty was a legal concept (see eg \nPotger (1970) 55 Cr App R 42; Halstead v Patel [1972] 1 WLR 661).  The subjective nature of the \nFeely test, whereby the defendant\u2019s own judgement was the critical one, was described as an \u2018alarming \nproposition\u2019: D W Elliott \u2018Dishonesty in Theft: A dispensable concept\u2019 [1982] Crim LR 395, 397. \n143 [1982] QB 1053. \n 37 \nthe standards of ordinary decent people, then there was no dishonesty.  The full test \ncan be set out like this:144 (1) \u2018was what was done dishonest according to the ordinary \nstandards of reasonable and honest people?\u2019  (2) \u2018Must the defendant have realised \nthat what he was doing was dishonest according to those standards?\u2019  This test should \nonly be put to the jury if the defendant himself raises the possibility that he did not \nconsider his conduct to be dishonest according to the ordinary standards of reasonable \nand honest people.145\n \n   \nAssessing whether something is dishonest according to the ordinary standards of \nreasonable and honesty people will obviously depend upon the facts of the case.  It \nmay be argued that a freegan who goes bin-diving in the dead of night is by his \nbehaviour being dishonest.  A lay person (and, indeed, a lawyer) may well ask with all \nreasonableness, \u2018If he was honest, why does he not go and bin-dive in the middle of \nthe day?\u2019  Certainly, if someone takes goods in a blatant and open manner in the \ndaytime, as in R v Wood, then there is strong evidence of an absence of dishonesty.146  \nThe advice for freegans would seem to be that they should be open about their \nbehaviour.147\n                                                 \n144 This is the formulation used by Griew: E Griew \u2018Dishonesty: The Objections to Feely and Ghosh\u2019 \n[1985] Crim LR 341, 341-342.  It derives from the following passage of Lord Lane CJ\u2019s judgement in \nR v Ghosh [1982] QB 1053, 1064: \u2018In determining whether the prosecution has proved that the \ndefendant was acting dishonestly, a jury must first of all decide whether according to the ordinary \nstandards of reasonable and honest people what was done was dishonest.  If it was not dishonest by \nthose standards, that is the end of the matter and the prosecution fails.  If it was dishonest by those \nstandards, then the jury must consider whether the defendant himself must have realised that what he \nwas doing was by those standards dishonest.\u2019  See also Simester and Sullivan p 493; Smith and Hogan \np 783; Smith\u2019s Law of Theft [2.295]; A Halpin Definition in the Criminal Law (Oxford: Hart Publishing \n2004) ch 4. \n   Yet such is the nature of British seasons, there may well be total \n145 R v Roberts (1985) 84 Cr App R 177; R v Price (1989) 90 Cr App R 409.  See also Smith\u2019s Law of \nTheft [2.279] suggesting that the statutory provisions on dishonesty should be preferred to the Ghosh \ntest if claims of right are made (see n 131). \n146 [2002] EWCA Crim 832. \n147 See also P Gerstenblith \u2018The Adverse Possession of Personal Property\u2019 (1988-1989) 37 Buff L Rev \n119, 128, noting that with regard to the law concerning the acquisition of good title to personal \nproperty by adverse possession, there is some considerable importance attached to adverse possession \n 38 \ndarkness at three o\u2019clock in the afternoon (in mid-winter), or it may not get dark until \ngone eleven at night (in mid-summer).    Thus it can be seen that bin-diving may well \noccur in the dark, but for reasons that have little to do with dishonesty.  The failure to \nretain a distinction between offences that occur at different points in the day in the \nTheft Act 1968, when there was such a distinction in the previous law,148 strongly \nsuggests that such facts should not impact upon the dishonesty test.149  Yet it does \nappear that the timing of the taking can have a significant impact on determining the \nlevel of honesty.  A clear comparison can be made between Rostron,150\n \n where the \ndefendants were collecting golf balls in the middle of the night and were found to \nhave been dishonest, and Wood, which involved a taking in the middle of the day. \nIt appears that the purpose of testing an individual\u2019s dishonesty against the ordinary \nstandards of reasonable and honest people is to provide a solution to a problem of fair \nlabelling \u2013 should there be criminalisation of people who commit acts that are \ntechnically thefts, but the nature of the act is such that ordinary people would not \nconsider them to be a \u201cthief\u201d?  In Feely Lawton LJ stated that \u2018a taking to which no \nmoral obloquy can reasonably attach is not within the concept of stealing either at \ncommon law or under the Theft Act 1968.\u2019151\n                                                                                                                                            \nin an \u2018open and notorious\u2019 manner (citing Burroughs Adding Machine Co v Bivens-Corhn Co (1941) \n189 Okla 616, 617; 119 P2d 58, 59). \n  His Lordship followed with this: \u2018We \nfind it impossible to accept that a conviction for stealing, whether it be called larceny \nor theft, can reveal no moral obloquy.  A man so convicted would have difficulty in \npersuading his friends and neighbours that his reputation had not been gravely \ndamaged.  He would be bound to be lowered in the estimation of right thinking \n148 There used to be separate offence for burglary depending on the timing of the act: see eg Smith\u2019s \nLaw of Theft [8.01]. \n149 It may well go to sentencing though: R v Saw et al [2009] EWCA Crim 1 [22]. \n150 [2003] EWCA Crim 2206. \n151 [1973] QB 530, 539. \n 39 \npeople.\u2019152  This approach thus gives rise to the following question: is there a \nsufficient moral obloquy about freeganism to justify a theft conviction?153\n \n \nIn his famous denunciation of the dishonesty test formulated following Feely and \nGhosh,154 Griew objected to the potential increase in the volume, the difficulty and \nthe length of jury trials.155  However, if the issue that is to be determined is whether a \ndefendant is dishonest, then there seems to be nothing wrong with requiring jury \nmembers to make that determination.  This is particularly so with regard to freegans.  \nIf it is accepted that there are at least strong doubts over the value of pursuing a theft \nconviction for behaviour, such as freeganism, that may attract minimal, if any, \u2018moral \nobloquy\u2019,156 then there cannot be serious problems with letting a jury determine \nwhether an individual\u2019s conduct indicates, to use Griew\u2019s own words, \u2018a \ntemperamental flaw but not a moral one\u2019.157\n \n  The real problem is whether the jury will \nsee a temperamental flaw, such as the willingness to obtain food for consumption \nfrom bins, and believe they have evidence of \u2018moral obloquy\u2019 because of their level of \ndisgust.  The possibility of this occurring can be presumed on the basis of comments \nto an article on freeganism on the BBC News website.  The following are three \ndifferent comments made which clearly indicate a negative view of freeganism which \nis founded primarily on the notions of disgust: \n                                                 \n152 Ibid, 541. \n153 See also S P Green Lying, Cheating, and Stealing: A Moral Theory of White-Collar Crime (Oxford: \nOUP 2006) p 1: \u2018penal sanctions ... should be reserved for conduct that is truly and unambiguously \nblameworthy.\u2019 \n154 Griew, above n 144.

You can afford to buy the food yet choose not \nto, so it's thrown out, then you scrub through a bin for it.  You may as well be \nstealing it from the shop.  You\u2019re causing the waste by not buying the food in \nthe first place.  Sounds like a poor excuse for being tight fisted to me, not a \nprotest against supermarkets.\u2019    \n \n\u2018Scroungers.  Why don\u2019t they go in to the store and look for the reduced items \nthat will end up in the bin and BUY IT!  Strewth everybody wants something \nfor nothing.  I bet if this lot hurt themselves whilst getting the food they'll sue \nthe supermarkets!\u2019   \n \n\u2018You can justify it all you like.  You can sugar coat it.  But it\u2019s EATING \nFROM A BIN.\u2019158\n  \n \nThe level of disgust one might feel about eating food from a bin is clearly linked into \nthe conceptualisation of rubbish and waste as a bad thing.  In her excellent analysis of \nthe American approach to rubbish Strasser noted the turn from viewing scavengers in \n19th century America in a sympathetic light to seeing them as being closely \nconnected to criminal activity.159   Likewise the development of various social, \ncharitable and governmental provisions in 19th century America was accompanied by \ncommentators reporting their disgust at children picking over rubbish for salvageable \ngoods,160 with particular emphasis on the link between poverty and squalor as \nopposed to the developing sanitation and hygiene regime.161\n                                                 \n158 \n  Thus began the \nhttp:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/magazine\/6933744.stm. \n159 S Strasser Waste and Want: A Social History of Trash (New York: Henry Holt 2000) pp 114-117. \n160 Ibid, pp 111-159, and especially pp 138-139. \n161 Ibid, pp 161-181. \n 41 \ndepersonalisation and the industrialisation of waste disposal, and arguably the \ncrystallisation of the link between disgust and rubbish.162  Yet the whole point of \nfreegan bin-diving for food is that this notion of disgust is essentially a societal \ncreation resting on the goods\u2019 status as waste, rather than their actual condition: \u2018At \nfirst the new scavenger is filled with disgust and self-loathing \u2026 That stage passes \nwith experience ... He beings to understand: People throw away perfectly good stuff, a \nlot of perfectly good stuff.\u2019163\n \n  It can only be supposed that ingrained notions of \ndisgust will inevitably feed through to the conceptually different notion of dishonesty.  \nThe possibility of inconsistent decisions,164 accompanying the obvious fiction of \ncommunity norms of honesty,165 means a freegan will not be able to determine with \nany certainty whether a jury will find his actions honest.  Certainly there is the risk \nthat the jury will consist of people for whom there is little distinction between disgust \nand dishonesty.  Nevertheless, the \u2018great assumption\u2019 that there is a singular concept \nof dishonesty,166 may not provide a fatal blow to a freegan\u2019s chances of success.  \nBecause \u2018we can no longer confidently assert that every juror will have access to a \nuniform body of standards when interpreting dishonesty\u2019,167\n                                                 \n162 See generally J Scanlan On Garbage (London: Reaktion Books 2005). \n the possibility that jury \nmembers will consider bin-diving honest must also be accepted.  Indeed, there is a \ngrowing body of empirical evidence which suggests that jury members may well \nconsider bin-diving to be an act which does not have sufficient moral obloquy to be \n163 L Eighner Travels with Lizbeth (New York: St Martin\u2019s 1993) pp 118-119 (a memoir of American \nhomelessness, describing bin-diving), cited in Strasser, above n 159, p 3. \n164 Griew, above n 144, p 344.

In a recent paper by Green and Kugler,168\n \n the views of first \nyear law students at Rutgers School of Law (in Newark, New Jersey, USA) about the \nblameworthiness of different types of theftous conduct were assessed.  The students \nseemed to draw substantial differences between different types of theftous conduct.  \nUnfortunately the students were not asked about freegan bin-diving, but the evidence \ndemonstrated that they were willing to grade crimes according to their seriousness, \nwith armed robbery the most serious, embezzlement n the middle, and failing to give \nup lost or mis-delivered goods as the least serious.  This does suggest that a jury faced \nwith a bin-diving situation case might not consider such behaviour dishonest. \nIn an ongoing online experiment, Fafinski and Finch are assessing people\u2019s responses \nto certain scenarios in order to provide evidence as to the provenance of a community \nnotion of dishonesty.169  Preliminary results from the experiment indicate that honesty \nis a diverse standard, with evidence of different conceptions of dishonesty depending \non age and gender.  Furthermore, \u2018there are a number of scenarios where the \nrespondent says, \u201cThis person is being dishonest, but I would not convict them\u201d.  \nPresumably they are refusing to convict because they don\u2019t think what the person has \ndone is \u201cthat bad\u201d.\u2019170\n \n  It is suggested that if such views do prevail, then freeganism is \njust the sort of practice which would attract opprobrium, but only to the maximum \nextent of being considered \u201cdishonest\u201d without having sufficient moral obloquy to be \nconsidered criminal. \n                                                 \n168 S P Green and M B Kugler \u2018Community Perceptions of Theft Seriousness: A Challenge to Model \nPenal Code and English Theft Act Consolidation\u2019 (January 6, 2009).

In Ghosh, Lord \nLane CJ stated that it would be dishonest for a defendant to act in a way he knows \nordinary persons would consider dishonest, even if he honestly believes he is acting \ncorrectly (the two examples his Lordship gave were Robin Hood and an anti-\nvivisectionist), \u2018because they know that ordinary people would consider these actions \nto be dishonest.\u2019171  However, as Elliott noted, this would be ignoring the fact that it \nwould still be a jury question; and that a jury may well decide in favour of Robin \nHood.172  This was also one of Griew\u2019s objections to Ghosh: \u2018Robin Hood must be a \nthief even if he thinks the whole of the right-thinking world is on his side.\u2019173\n \n  Yet is \nthis actually the case?   \nIf theft is rationalised by reference to a broad conception of the harm principle \noperating as a mechanism for protecting a property right regime,174 then the odious \nnature of allowing a Robin Hood defence becomes clear.  So as Steel has noted, \n\u2018[a]lthough defendants might raise a lack of dishonesty to avoid conviction, the \ngeneral community interest in maintaining the property regime means it is likely that \nsuch claims are viewed sceptically by juries\u2019.175\n                                                 \n171 [1982] QB 1053, 1064. \n  On the other hand, there is \nconsiderable strength in Steel\u2019s thesis that such an approach overstates the importance \nof regime protection, and understates the necessity of some sort of felonious thought \n172 D W Elliott \u2018Dishonesty in Theft: A dispensable concept\u2019 [1982] Crim LR 395, 398. \n173 Griew, above n 144, p 353. \n174 See eg A P Simester and G R Sullivan \u2018\u2018On the Nature and Rationale of Property Offences\u2019 in R A \nDuff and S P Green (eds) Defining Crimes: Essays on the Special Part of Criminal Law (Oxford: OUP \n2005) ch 8. \n175 A Steel \u2018The Harms and Wrongs of Stealing: The Harm Principle and Dishonesty in Theft\u2019 (2008) \n31 University of New South Wales Law Journal 712, 734. \n 44 \non the part of the thief, ie dishonesty.176  On this foundation a Robin Hood defence \nbecomes intelligible, if not actually legitimate.  The same logic would also hold with \nfreeganism at a basic level, and it is at least arguable that there is even greater validity \nin defining freeganism as a non-theftous action because in contradistinction to \u2018Robin \nHood\u2019 cases, freegans are taking goods that have been disposed of as rubbish (and not \ngold coins and crowns).177\n(c) The interaction between abandonment and dishonesty \n \nIn dealing with cases involving (potentially) abandoned goods, the courts have \ngenerally failed to deal with the interconnections between abandonment and \ndishonesty (either in terms of the claim of right defences or the effect of the two-stage \ntest for dishonesty developed in Feely and Ghosh).  At best this failure creates a \nconsiderable area of uncertainty in this part of the law.  At worst, it demonstrates an \nunwelcome disconnection of the actus reus of theft ie the taking of goods belonging \nto another, from the mens rea issue of honesty.  It is an important aspect of the \ndishonesty test that the alleged thief has his state of mind tested; this can be inferred \nfrom his conduct but conduct alone, without reference to the state of mind, cannot \nprove dishonesty.178\n                                                 \n176 Ibid, especially p 732: \u2018It is the element of dishonesty that separates criminal from tortious \ninterferences with property; theft from conversion.\u2019 \n  So the fact that a freegan has taken goods out of a bin should \nnot, of itself, prove dishonesty.  Further to this it is arguable that if a freegan takes \n177 Simester and Sullivan, above n 174, pp 172-174 argue that there is an offence where D takes V\u2019s old \nshirt, even though V has no use for the old shirt and will throw it away whereas D can put the shirt to \ngood use, on the basis that use-value justifications must be subservient to the protection of a property \nrights regime.  Steel correctly notes that this argument fails to take into account the possibility that D \ncan himself claim the protection of the property rights regime on the grounds of his possessory interest \nin the shirt (Steel, above n 175, p 729).  Furthermore, it could be argued that if the shirt is in fact being \nthrown out, then it is being abandoned, and that the property rights regime no longer provides \nprotection for V (and thus D\u2019s possessory interest takes precedence). \n178 See eg Smith\u2019s Law of Theft [2.271] fn 453 and accompanying text, citing inter alia Small [1987] \nCrim LR 777. \n 45 \ngoods in the belief (whether correct or not) that they have been abandoned he is \noperating under an honest belief.179\n \n \nThe unwillingness of the courts to deal with this interaction between belief as to the \nprovenance of the goods, and the level of honesty on the part of the accused, is clear \nin the golf balls cases.  To some extent the absence of discussion of the honesty issue \nin Hibbert v McKiernan is excusable as that case involved the offence of larceny, and \nthe current law provides broader honesty-based defences for those accused of theft.  \nThis makes the decision of the Court of Appeal in Rostron somewhat less defensible \nthough.  There the Court did consider the dishonesty issue, but in a rather desultory \nfashion consisting of only two paragraphs of analysis, based on the issue of a failure \nof the trial judge to provide a Ghosh direction.  The Court decided that the trial \njudge\u2019s direction was fair to the defendants, in that it asked whether they had taken \nthe golf balls knowing that they were not entitled to go onto the golf course and take \nballs.  In this narrow sense this is probably correct.  But it really is a side-step from \nthe issue of honesty, rather than taking the issue on.  The paucity of judicial guidance \non the conflation of claims of abandonment and honest taking surely required some \nconsideration of this matter. \n \nIn spite of the confusion shown by the decisions in Hibbert v McKiernan and Rostron, \nit does appear that a freegan bin-diver may be able to show he is not dishonest, \nbecause of his honest belief that the goods are abandoned.  In R v Small,180\n                                                 \n179 Cf Griew [2.101]: an honest belief that goods were abandoned can negative the \u201cintention to \npermanently deprive\u201d requirement of the theft offence. \n D had \ncome across a car.  It had been in the same place for a fortnight.  It was unlocked, \nthere was no fuel and the battery was flat.  After getting the car working again, D \n180 [1987] Crim LR 777; (1988) 86 Cr App R 170. \n 46 \ndrove off in it.  He was arrested and charged with theft.  The car had been stolen, but \nD honestly believed the car had been \u2018dumped\u2019.181  The Court of Appeal quashed his \nconviction.  It was held that the effect of William White,182 and Ellerman\u2019s Wilson \nLine Limited v Webster,183 was that \u2018an honest belief that property was abandoned is a \ndefence\u2019,184\n \n and that this honest belief need not be a reasonable one.  \nMore recently, the Court of Appeal decided the case of R v Wood.185\n \n  There the \ndefendant was convicted of theft.  He had taken the entire contents of a fabric shop.  \nThe shop had been operating until February 2000, when the two active partners had \nreturned to Pakistan.  From that point on the shop did not operate.  The stock and \nother goods remained in the shop, and the third partner in the business occasionally \nchecked the shop, but as a silent partner with a full-time occupation outside of this \nbusiness the checking process was a minimal one. \n\u2018It was in these circumstances that this appellant and his friend went to the \nshop on the evening of 15th August.  They cleared the entire shop, leaving \nnothing behind.  This was at least the fourth visit which the appellant had \nmade there, because in earlier days, during daylight and on foot by himself \nwith a shopping trolley, he had removed odd rolls of fabric from the shop and \ntaken them home.  He admitted that he was a trespasser in the shop but said \nthat he genuinely believed that everything in the shop had been abandoned \nproperty and that he was therefore not dishonest when he helped himself to it.  \nHe prayed in aid previous expeditions with the shopping trolley in broad \n                                                 \n181 (1988) 86 Cr App R 170, 171. \n182 (1912) 7 Cr App R 266. \n183 [1952] 1 Lloyd\u2019s Rep 179. \n184 (1988) 86 Cr App R 170, 172. \n185 [2002] EWCA Crim 832. \n 47 \ndaylight without any interference as confirming him in the honesty of his \nbelief.\u2019186\n \n \nThe Court held that a simple Ghosh direction was inappropriate, and that this type of \ncase needed a direction that if the defendant had or might have had an honest belief \nthat the goods were abandoned, then the jury would have to acquit.187  Application of \nthe Ghosh test is \u2018best left\u2019 to those cases where there is a conflict as to what is \nconsidered honest; the presence of an honest belief means Ghosh may be unhelpful.188\n4. CONCLUSION \n  \nSo for a freegan bin-diver, provided he has an honest belief that the goods in a bin \nhave been abandoned, based on the fact they are in the bin, the presence of such a \nbelief may well provide a defence. \nIn this article it has been established that freegans could have two defences to claims \nthat they commit theft by bin-diving.  The first, that the goods are abandoned, has \nconsiderable intuitive value.189  It is difficult to see goods that have been disposed of \nas rubbish, as waste, as anything other than abandoned.  This is particularly so if an \n\u2018economic value\u2019 approach, as expressed by Rolfe B, Pollock and Wright, and Lord \nDenning MR, is taken to assessing the possibility of abandonment.190\n                                                 \n186 Ibid, [3]. \n  It is also \nimportant to acknowledge that the fact that property appears abandoned may well be \nevidence that it actually has been abandoned: courts must not fall into the trap of \nassuming that property cannot have been abandoned.  This point is illustrated by the \n187 Ibid, [24]. \n188 Ibid, [26].  See also Smith\u2019s Law of Theft, [2.279]. \n189 See above, text following n 24. \n190 See above, text accompanying n 55 \u2013 n 66. \n 48 \ndifferent approaches taken in Rowe and William White.191  Furthermore, those cases \ndealing directly with waste, Edwards and Stacey and Williams v Phillips, should be \ntreated with care, and can probably be restricted by virtue of the defendants\u2019 \nemployment by the \u2018victims\u2019.192  However, there are awkward problems with the law \nrelating to abandonment.  Whilst it may be intuitive that rubbish is abandoned, the \nspecific circumstances of each situation will be determinative of the issue of \nabandonment.  As Professor John Smith said in commenting on the Ghosh case, \u2018[t]he \ninvolvement of the law of theft with property concepts provides a fruitful source of \nfine and subtle distinctions, with plenty of scope for legitimate differences of \nopinion.\u2019193\n \n  However, this contextualism creates problems of certainty for freegans.   \nThe analysis of the case-law on abandonment, and in particular the decisions in \nHibbert v McKiernan and Rostron,194\n \n indicates that a significant determining factor in \nfinding situations is the (dis)honesty of the finder.  It is submitted that a freegan will \nhave a greater chance of defending himself against a charge of theft on the grounds he \nis not dishonest.  This may be counter-intuitive, as at first sight it is arguable that a \nfreegan is acting dishonestly.  However, as has been shown, a more rational approach \nis to view freeganism as something that is not dishonest, either subjectively or \nobjectively.  The impact of Ghosh, and the definition of dishonesty in the Theft Act \n1968, provides various opportunities for freegans to show that they are not dishonest, \nand are thus not thieves. \n                                                 \n191 See above, text accompanying n 79 \u2013 n 84. \n192 See above, text following n 100. \n193 J C Smith \u2018R v Ghosh \u2013 Case Commentary\u2019 [1982] Crim LR 608, 610. \n194 See above, text accompanying n 85 \u2013 n 98. \n 49 \nIt is important to avoid putting words (or purposes) into the law of theft which do not \nbelong there: according to Bridge LJ the courts should \u2018shun the temptation which \nsometimes presses on the mind of the judiciary to suppose that because a particular \ncourse of conduct ... was anti-social and undesirable, it can necessarily be fitted into \nsome convenient criminal pigeon-hole\u2019.195\n \n  I think it is probably unlikely that Bridge \nLJ had the concept of freeganism at the top of his mind when he made this statement, \nbut the applicability of the general principle it enunciates cannot be doubted.  \nFreeganism covers behaviour, such as bin-diving, which portions of society may well \nfind disgusting, possibly even anti-social.  Yet for those reasons alone certain \nbehaviour cannot be criminalised.  There must surely be some harm involved.  And \nthat is the crux of the matter.  Freegans cannot be understood as harming anyone.  \nThey are disposing of property that has already been deemed unworthy of retention or \n\u201cappropriate\u201d commercial disposition.  To the extent that freegans reduce the potential \ncosts of disposal of waste as landfill, or by incineration, it could well be argued that \ntheir behaviour is in fact harm-reducing, and as such should be lauded and not \ncriminalised. \nThe final point concerns the decision of the Court of Appeal in Wood.196\n                                                 \n195 Charles [1976] 1 All ER 659, 666.  See also Griew [2.122]-[2.123] arguing that the vagueness of \ndishonesty means that the issue is determined by ex post facto reasoning based on subjective notions of \nwickedness, which is an \u2018objectionable principle\u2019. \n  There the \ndecision was clear: the defendant, who was essentially acting as a freegan, was not \nacting dishonestly.  It is submitted that when faced with instances of freeganism of \nabandoned goods (whether apparently or in actuality), the approach in Wood is far \nmore appropriate than the approach taken in Rostron. \n196 See above, text accompanying n 185 \u2013 n 188. \n"}
