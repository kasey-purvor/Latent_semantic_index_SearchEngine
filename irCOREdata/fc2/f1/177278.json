Using the framework \napproach, the data generated from 14 participants were analysed with coding of emergent \nthemes. Data were analysed separately for providers and commissioner organisations.  \nResults  \nVariations were observed in how IPs are introduced from both the provider and \ncommissioner perspectives. Patterns of approaches allowed the development of models \nreflecting practice at each type of organisation: very structured in some places to, \nunstructured or almost non-existent in others. Factors affecting the decision to introduce a \nprocedure include: immediate costs and benefits, numbers of people affected, training \nrequirements, NICE guidance, nature of procedure, support from colleagues, incentives, \npublic or policy-maker pressure, and aims of the institution. Monitoring was seen as a key \narea for improvement by many.  \nConclusions \nThese variations indicate that the process of introducing new IPs in the NHS can be \nimproved. Factors affecting decision-making and problems have been identified. The results \nof our study could inform and help shape future processes of managing and the introduction \nof new procedures into the NHS.  \n \n  \nINTRODUCTION \nInterventional procedures (IPs) are health technologies used for diagnosis or treatment involving \nan incision, puncture, entry into the body cavity or the use of electromagnetic radiation.[1] They are \nthe least regulated type of health technologies. Decisions regarding their introduction into the \nNational Health Services (NHS) lie within the individual Trusts (England and Wales) or Boards \n(Scotland). Currently, there is no prescribed way to do this. \n \nWe therefore undertook an exploratory qualitative study to describe and understand the current \nprocesses of introduction of IPs into clinical practice. This study was designed to explore \nexperiences and perceptions of NHS decision-makers regarding how they handle new IPs and to \nidentify problems areas for improvement. How NHS decision-makers respond to IPs with NICE IP \nguidance has been reported elsewhere.[2]  \n \nMETHODS \nParticipants and setting \nAs healthcare delivery is organised differently across the UK, a purposive sampling strategy was \nadopted to select NHS employees in England, Wales and Scotland representing different roles, \ntypes and sizes of practices (Table 1). Sampling in qualitative research is normally non-random as \nthe aim is not to obtain an \u2018on average\u2019 view of a wider population, but instead, to gain an in depth \nunderstanding of the experience of particular individuals,[3] and to reflect the diversity within a \ngiven population[4] (we were particularly interested in variation in approaches and perceptions). \nWe chose decision-makers who were involved in one or more of the following activities, as people \nwith these roles are likely to be those who influence the uptake of new interventional procedures:  \n\u2022 Decision-making about how resources should be used in the NHS; \n\u2022 Prioritisation of new interventional procedures in the NHS, and  \n\u2022 Delivery of interventional treatment to patients in the NHS. \n \nThe professional roles of decision-makers who were invited to participate included chief \nexecutives of Trusts or Health Boards, medical directors, clinical directors, consultant \nsurgeons, public health consultants. \n \nThe sample consisted of 18 decision-makers who were identified in three ways: from a list of \nknown committee members of the IPP\u2020\n \n; an NHS network group with an interest in public health; \nand subsequent snowball and convenience sampling. Committee members of the IPP were \ntargeted because their professional roles indicated that they were active locally in decision-making \nabout interventional procedures. Moreover, being part of the Programme meant that they would \nbe familiar with the topic under investigation. Participants were also drawn from the NHS network \ngroup because it was mainly represented by public health consultants who predominantly work at \nthe commissioner side of the NHS and hence are likely to play an important role in regulating what \nis offered to patients. This sample was chosen to describe a range of knowledge interpretation \nand general awareness. A recruitment letter with details about the study was e-mailed to every \nperson contacted.  \nData collection \nData was generated from NHS decision-makers using one to one, face to face semi-structured \ninterviews, at a time and venue convenient for the participant. Prior to the interview, participants \nreceived a \u2018participant information leaflet\u2019 explaining study\u2019s objectives and purpose of the \ninterview. All participants signed a consent form at the beginning of the interview. Using an \ninterview topic guide, participants were asked open-ended questions exploring (1) the current \nprocess of introduction of new IPs at the participant\u2019s place of work, (2) any problems with and \npotential improvements to the current process. Data were digitally recorded and transcribed \nverbatim. \n \n                                               \n\u2020 The Interventional Procedures Advisory Committee members include the following job titles: chief executives, medical \ndirectors, clinical directors; academic researchers; patient representatives.  \nData analysis \nData was entered into NVivo (v.7 computer software, QSR International, Melbourne, Australia) for \ncoding and analysis using techniques drawn from the framework approach.[4,5] A coding frame \nwas developed based on our initial research questions and emerging themes from the transcripts. \nTwo researchers systematically coded the transcripts. Thematic categories were developed by \nfurther refining the initial coding frame and thematic charts were checked by at least one other \nresearcher within the team.  \n \nModels characterising the current process of introduction of new IPs in the NHS were developed \nthrough a systematic synthesis of the framework charts whereby similarities and differences were \nidentified and compared across respondents. \n \nDifferent organisational arrangements of the NHS are in place in England, Scotland and Wales, \nhowever, regardless of country, NHS organisations can be broadly divided into commissioner and \nprovider of services. Decision-makers\u2019 views for both types of organisational arrangements were \nexplored, and a stratified data-analysis was conducted in order to identify potential subgroup \ndifferences in how new IPs are handled and perceived by commissioners and providers. \n \nRESULTS \nOut of the 18 decision-makers contacted, 15 replied and agreed to be interviewed, although an \ninterview time could not be set for one. Fourteen interviews were conducted by one researcher \nover a period of four months in 2008. The sample varied in relation to setting, type of \norganisational structure (commissioner or provider) and role in the decision-making process \n(Table 1). Respondents were widely dispersed: nine from England (six of ten Strategic Health \nAuthorities), four from Scotland and one from Wales. \n \nManagement strategies of new interventional procedures  \nProvider organisations \nThe procedure for deciding whether and in what way to introduce new IPs in local clinical practice \nvaried across settings, between clinical directorates, and within provider organisations. It was \nfound that some centres had more structured processes than others: \n \nK120: \u201cI don\u2019t think there is a formal process. For a lot of new procedures, they are introduced ad hoc by \nindividuals who are interested in doing something different.\u201d \n \nN123: \u201c\u2026if a surgeon wants to introduce an IP they have to apply through the different channels and \nactually have to put forward a business case to use that intervention even though it might be seen in other \nareas as a recognised acceptable treatment.\u201d \n \nHowever, patterns were identified enabling the development of broad conceptual models (Figure \n1). The process ubiquitously starts with a clinician wanting to deliver a new IP. Some respondents \ndescribed how this was initially followed by informal discussions with peers and the clinical \ndirector responsible for the service: \n \nD114: \u201c\u2026all new procedures or variations in procedures should be discussed with colleagues prior to \nundertaking them, except in an emergency.\u201d \nE115: \u201c\u2026 the clinician would, firstly, discuss with his own colleagues within the directorate about the \nappropriateness of how a new procedure might fit with the clinical service\u2026.\u201d \n \nOne respondent described how the clinical director had the responsibility for deciding whether the \nIP should be notified to a special group or committee for further evaluation whereas in other \ncentres, the clinician wanting to introduce the IP directly notified the group\/committee. Such \ngroups\/committees generally had an executive role, although in one centre the group\/committee \nhad an advisory role only and the clinical director had full autonomy as to whether to implement \nthe advice in order to avoid conflicts with the clinical director\u2019s role: \n \nD114: \u201c\u2026if we say [the group] has got the power to say yes or no, and the poor clinical director is the one \nwho has to fund it, then what you can get is consultants going off\u2026 \u2018I want to do this. I\u2019ve got permission \nfrom [the group]\u2026 And the poor clinical director with financial control says, \u2018ahhhh, I\u2019ve lost my \nresponsibility because it has been taken by somebody else!\u2019 Which is why [the group] was specifically set \nup so that it couldn\u2019t undermine the clinical director\u2019s role.\u201d \n \nIn general, membership of these groups\/committees included not only clinical representatives, but \nalso managers, and ethics and patient representatives. Following agreement to \u2018credential\u2019 the \nclinician to carry out the procedure, most respondents described the necessary preparation of a \nbusiness case for new IPs that had cost-consequences while appearing to provide additional \nbenefits to patients or had the potential to improve survival. Business cases were generally \nprepared by the clinician making the request. In one centre, commercial sponsors often offered to \nprepare business cases for clinicians: \n \nN123: \u201cThe onus is definitely on the clinician, we [clinicians] may not have...  any financial acumen in how \nyou present the business case\u2026 and they [clinicians] might not have time to actually prepare that business \ncase. What some reps do is that they will prepare a business case for you\u2026\u201d \nThe content of business cases was similar across centres with minor variations (Box 1). Although \npresentation of a business case to the decision-maker holding the budget is part of the formal \nprocess, resources are often secured from sources external to the NHS. In those centres where a \ncommittee\/group is in place to address these issues, who makes the decision following the \nbusiness case would be the committee\/group. In the centre in which the committee is only \nadvisory, the individual holding the budget would be the ultimate decision-maker. In the other two \ncentres, this was unclear.     \n \nDespite a process being in place for the introduction of procedures, a perception was expressed \nthat clinicians often do not adhere to it:  \n \nB112: \u201csome people won\u2019t necessarily know that they\u2019re supposed to do that [formal process], I\u2019m not sure \nhow anyone in the trust knows that that\u2019s happened [procedures], to be absolutely honest.\u201d  \n \nA111: \u201c\u2026the clinicians, if they choose not to tell you about it and they can find somebody to give them the \nkit, they just get on and do it.\u201d \n \nTwo respondents (E115, K120) described how the sole decision-makers for the introduction of a \nnew IP can be the clinicians themselves, with no clear regulatory body within the hospital \nenforcing the safe and appropriate introduction of new IPs.  \n \nCommissioner organisations  \nMinor variations were observed in the role of commissioner organisations in the introduction of \nnew IPs (Figure 2). All respondents described how their centres had a reactive process with the \nmajority being started by clinicians and\/or patients proposing procedures to a group\/committee. In \none centre there was the expectation for provider organisations to inform commissioners about \nIPs that have immediate cost-consequences prior to introduction: \nG117: \u201c... if it\u2019s an increased cost or if it\u2019s a change in service, we would expect them [providers] to come \nback and discuss that with our Commissioning Department Directorate.\u201d \n \nOne respondent described a less structured procedure than the rest: \n \nJ119: \u201cDrugs have a very structured process, but I would say there\u2019s not a parallel structured process for \nother interventions.\u201d  \n \nIn contrast, the expectation, as described in another centre, was that provider organisations \nshould always ask the commissioners whether they can introduce a new service; and another \nrespondent believed that requests for IPs would always go to the commissioner, due to the tight \nfinancial state of provider organisations. \n \nThe development of a business case was a compulsory stage in the process for all commissioning \ncentres studied regarding IPs considered as potentially being an improvement of services but \nhaving immediate cost-consequences. Business cases were generally prepared by individuals \ntasked to do this within the organisation although one respondent indicated that the clinician \nmaking the request was expected to produce the business case with help from a person tasked at \nmanagement level. The content of business cases was similar to that produced in provider \norganisations (Box 1). However, in one centre, the commissioners also sought an opinion from the \nclinician requesting the service and from the hospital.  \n \nOne respondent described the process as \u2018messy\u2019 (C113) and another as \u2018complicated\u2019 and \n\u2018tortuous\u2019, but the complexity was not seen by the decision-maker as such a hindrance that the \nprocess did not work (H118).   \n \n \n \nFactors affecting the decision to introduce interventional procedures  \nTable 2 summarises factors that were identified during the interviews, which can potentially affect \ndecision-making about the introduction of IPs and their effect on adoption as perceived by the \ndecision-makers.  \n \n \nProvider organisations \nA common factor was cost. It was perceived by all that extra costs of a new IP (such as a new \ndevice, disposable kit, or if it is a totally new technique requiring a new programme of care) is the \nmain obstacle to its introduction in the context of a constrained funding environment. Such \nresource implications have to be considered against the likelihood of higher patient benefits:  \n \nB112: \u201c\u2026I think as a committee in the trust we would not exclude something because it\u2019s a more \nexpensive treatment option\u2026\u201d \n \nOther factors influencing the introduction of IPs were manufacturer\/company incentives, the \nattitude towards the IP and support of colleagues: \n \nD114: \u201c\u2026the important thing is that there is a sufficient body of support from the professionals to be able to \naccept that this is a reasonable thing to undertake\u2026\u201d  \n \nSome argued that sometimes it is difficult to fulfil the specifications set by the decision-maker and \nthat some procedures are judged as being too innovative hence lacking in evidence. It was \nperceived by one respondent that it may be hard getting new treatments introduced if the IP is \ncarried out only in one or two other countries: \n \nF116: \u201c\u2026if the Norwegians and the Swedes are doing it, they are generally not known to be desperately \nadventurous in what they\u2019re doing. If they got research evidence that supports it then what\u2019s the problem?\u201d \n \nOne issue raised was potential conflicts of interest in members of the decision-making committee: \n \nN123: \u201c... one of the people that was sitting on the panel, his wife required the procedure and I had been \nasking for this to be introduced quite a lot, but I think there was a personal interest, so we were allowed to \ndo it, but only on a patient named basis\u2026 It helped other patients\u2026 but we haven\u2019t introduced the kit \ncommonly\u2026\u201d  \n \nMotivators for decisions to introduce a new procedure that were mentioned by respondents \nincluded: numbers affected (depending on the cost of the technology, this could be a motivator or \nnot), minor variations in practice, reduced cost, trained and competent operators, evidence of \nbenefits, and \u2018positive\u2019 NICE guidance.  \n \nCommissioner organisations \nAs with provider organisations, issues related to increased cost (i.e. affordability, financial state of \nthe organisation, training requirements) were viewed by all commissioners as significant barriers. \nOther factors mentioned were: pressure from the public and policy-making organisations, what \nother organisations are offering, and whether the new procedure supports the overall aims and \npriorities set by the organisation\u2019s board: \n \nG117: \u201cWhen something costs peanuts\u2026 then the decision is much more likely to be favourable, than \nwhen something costs hundreds of thousands.\u201d \n \nM122: \u201cIf a procedure becomes very well known, then sometimes we get additional pressure [from the \npublic].\u201d \n \nPerceived potential barriers to an effective response to new interventional procedures \nProvider organisations \nAlthough respondents were clear about the type of information needed for decision-making, it was \nrecognised that the assessments carried out by the groups\/committees are not always clear and \ntransparent: \n \nF116: \u201c\u2026I\u2019m not sure how scientific we are in the valuation [of procedures]. It\u2019s probably an emotional feel; \nthis is just a better service than something\u2026 this has the ability to be better than something else.\u201d \n \nIt was noted that it is difficult to monitor what goes on in the provider organisations. This is mainly \ndue to the lack of coding (and registers) of new IPs and as a consequence they depend on \nnursing staff and on reviews of case notes to identify IPs that are not standard practice: \n \nA111:\u201d The biggest problem with all of them is that not a single one of them\u2026 comes with an OPCS [Office \nof Population Censuses and Surveys] code, which means that when the coders come to do them, they call \nthem something else.\u201d  \n \nThe role of commissioner organisations in the introduction of IPs was considered \u2018obstructive\u2019 by \nsome respondents with a perception that they only fund procedures if they have been required to \ndo so. It was also noted that it can take a long time for clinicians to produce business cases \nbecause firstly, data on prevalence and incidence are very difficult to come by, and secondly, \nclinicians lack information on how much it costs the NHS per day for treating a particular type of \npatient.  \n \n \n \nCommissioner organisation \nThe main problem perceived by some commissioner organisations was that it is difficult to know \nwhat provider organisations are actually doing, and therefore difficult to stop procedures with \nsafety concerns: \n \nG117: \u201cthe difficulty is that actually we don\u2019t necessarily know what the trusts are doing\u2026In fact, it\u2019s \nunlikely that the trusts themselves will necessarily know the details of exactly what every single practitioner \nwithin that trust is doing\u2026 in theory we would be able to stop something that we thought was unsafe or that \nwe did not any longer want to pay for. In practice, I\u2019m not sure how often that happens.\u201d \nQ125: \u201c\u2026 I\u2019ve discovered recently that we\u2019re using it [a procedure] \u2026 nobody told us, as it has been used \nas part of the wound healing process by our district nurses\u2026 I can see where things can be going on \nwithout people knowing, and they obviously decided to introduce it without going through the committees.\u201d \n \nSuggestions for improvements of the current process of introduction of interventional \nprocedures \nProvider organisations \nThree respondents felt that the system used to introduce IPs is satisfactory, but they \nacknowledged that there is some room for improvement in their own organisations, particularly in \nrelation to the workforce available, and making the process smoother: \n \nD114: \u201cI think we handle it as good as possible\u2026 if one was more meticulous and had a bigger number of \npeople to help in clinical governance, I think we would like to complete the loop better...\u201d \n \nA111: \u201cI\u2019m happy with what we\u2019ve got, but I\u2019m conscious that is not how it is done around the country and \nwe\u2019re still learning as we go along. Even seven years in now, we\u2019re still developing the process and making \nit smoother and it\u2019s gradually changing with time, but all of the fundamentals are in place and it all works \nvery well.\u201d \nA couple of respondents highlighted the need to see a more formal process of introduction of \nprocedures in their organisation: \n \nE115: \u201cI think that\u2019s [the process] probably something that could be improved or if it exists it should be \nbetter advertised\u2026 The process probably needs to be more formalised and I think that the clinicians need \nto be familiarised and engaged in the process of generating those protocols and also know how to refer to \nthem.\u201d  \n \nK120: \u201cI\u2019d like to see a proper mechanism so that if anybody wants to introduce anything that\u2019s new\u2026 that \nwould have to go through a formal process. And that formal process would allow checks to be made as to \nwhat NICE was saying, what national associations were saying and anybody else who\u2019d form an opinion \nabout these things, so that you could get a robust mechanism for checking that opinion across the \nspectrum of whether it is a good thing that is trying to be introduced.\u201d \n \nA need for more robust mechanisms for monitoring was a common concern amongst \nrespondents. Some participants, therefore, wanted to see better systems and thought that having \na register to help monitoring procedures would be a helpful start: \n \nD114: \u201cWe need to have registers of new procedures and old procedures, for that matter the ones that are \ndoubts about their efficacy or safety, we should have many more better methods of collecting the data than \nwe have at the moment.\u201d  \n \nIn terms of information required for decision-making, one participant suggests that health \nauthorities should have information available so that clinicians could access it in order to inform \nbusiness cases. \n \nCommissioner organisations \nTwo respondents acknowledged that the process could be improved, but found it difficult to \nidentify what in particular could be improved. One respondent felt that the process should be \nfaster so that they could get quicker responses and greater influence in changing services.  \n \nH118: \u201c\u2026we should speed it up so we get quicker responses around what people are planning to do. \nParticularly if it\u2019s going to cost money, and they want to do it. Because the quicker we know about it, the \ngreater influence we\u2019ve got on the commissioners to actually do things in a different way.\u201d  \n \nAnother felt that the commissioner organisations need to acknowledge that the process is going to \nbe driven from the bottom up i.e. by clinicians. Better funding arrangements for a new IP were also \ncited as an area that needs to be improved: \nQ125: \u201c\u2026we\u2019re struggling to identify sufficient resources for routine practice \u2026 it\u2019s difficult to see a \nsituation where we\u2019d have sufficient resources to begin to introduce new technologies.\u201d \n \nDISCUSSION  \nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to describe how new IPs are introduced into clinical \npractice in the British NHS. We interviewed 14 NHS decision-makers which provided a range of \nviews and experiences.  \n \nThis exploratory study showed significant variation in how new IPs are introduced into clinical \npractice across the different provider centres. Some have a very structured and transparent \nprocess, including committees or groups and the development of business cases. Others use a \nmuch less structured approach in which the clinician wanting to introduce the procedure is the \nsole decision-maker, and business cases are prepared only if funds are required to continue to \nprovide the treatment. At commissioner organisations the variation identified across centres was \nless. Although most had a process, it was evident that new IPs were not considered a priority. \n \nThe lack of a standard approach is not unique to the UK, but rather a worldwide concern. Sharma \nand colleagues[6] demonstrated that there was no structured, explicit process for making \ndecisions about introducing new surgical technologies in Canada. Such lack of a decision-making \nprocess can be a barrier to the safe and efficient uptake of new health technologies.  \n \nOur study found that immediate cost and resource use were key factors in determining whether or \nnot a new procedure is adopted. Nevertheless, the overriding determinant was the balance \nbetween costs and benefits. This study also identified several other factors that play an important \nrole in decision-making. One is the availability of different types of evidence; another is the extent \nof current use of the technology in other centres.  \n \nThe monitoring of the use of procedures was perceived by participants as an area that needs to \nbe improved. A number of interviewees argued that better methods of collecting data on outcomes \nfor each new procedure should be implemented. The lack of unique coding and registries was \nseen to hinder the successful monitoring of procedures after their introduction.  \n \nThis study also suggests that the role of providers and commissioners in the decision-making \nprocess of introduction of new procedures is not clearly delineated. It appears that the process at \ncommissioner organisations often starts when funds are required to continue providing it. \nMoreover, it was reported that it is difficult for commissioners to know what is happening at the \nprovider side. Provider organisations on the other hand, felt that the role of commissioners could \nbe obstructive. On this basis, it seems that better communication between organisations would \nlikely improve the introduction of new procedures within the overall scheme of the NHS. Perhaps \nboth types of organisations should recognise that new procedures will be handled differently, \naccept independent process, and identify overlaps in their management structure.  \nAlthough an attempt was made to develop decision-making models reflecting the process of \nintroduction of new IPs in the NHS, it should be noted that the process was not always clear. This \nmay be because it is not as transparent as it should be, or that the centre does not often deal with \nnew IPs.     \n \nStrengths and weaknesses of the study \nThe use of a qualitative approach was an appropriate method to explore variation in how new IPs \nenter routine clinical practice. It allowed a detailed exploration of a complex area, making feasible \nthe identification of factors, key problems and potential improvements in the processes for \nintroducing new procedures. Although this is an exploratory study, it did successfully highlight the \nvariation in the process of introduction of new IPs across and within NHS organisations. Moreover, \nparticipants purposefully came from a diverse background reflecting different organisational \nstructures within the NHS, aiming to identify variation in the wider UK context. \n \nOur study has some limitations. It relied on the reported perceptions and experiences of decision-\nmakers, and then may not fully represent actual local practice. It is possible that participant\u2019s \nexposure to decision-making in relation to IPs may have been atypical and therefore their views \nmight not be representative of the NHS as a whole. Moreover, it is important to emphasise that \nthis study does not describe how frequently the various approaches are actually used in the NHS, \nbut it does indicate variability in the processes, which was our purpose.  \n \nFurthermore, although the sample was purposively identified, it is possible that further variation in \napproaches might have been identified had more people been interviewed. As described in the \nresults, there was consistency across interviewees, suggestive of saturation. The sample size of \n14 represented a balance between reliable identification of significant variation, and logistical and \npractical constraints within a broader programme of work. However, the 14 participants \ninterviewed came from a total of 12 different NHS administrative regions in the UK, which enabled \nthe identification of a range of knowledge, interpretations, and general awareness towards the \nregulation of IPs making the findings relevant to other centres in the wider UK context.  \n \nConclusion \nThe objective of this paper was not to judge the quality of care of patients in the British NHS, but \nto highlight areas that could be improved. Although faced with the challenges posed by the rapid \ntechnological advancement, undoubtedly clinicians\u2019 primary interest is to deliver the best possible \nlevel of care to their patients. The introduction of new IPs is an area of high complexity and \nparamount uncertainty and a \u2018perfect\u2019 process is yet to be developed. This study showed that the \nprocess of introduction of new IPs in the NHS can be improved. The results of our study can be \nused to inform and help shape future processes of managing and introducing new procedures into \nthe NHS.  \n \nCompeting interests \nNone. \n \nEthical approval \nNot required. \n \nREFERENCES \n[1] National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.
