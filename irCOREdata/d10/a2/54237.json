INTRODUCTION \nIn 2005, there were about 38.6 millions of adults and children suffering from the human \nimmunodeficiency virus (HIV). The total infected population is increasing year by year [8]. There are \nabout twenty medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the US \ngovernment. These medications can suppress the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). \nIt was reported in [9]-[27] that the response of the CD4 lymphocyte population, the CD8 \nlymphocyte population and the HIV-1 viral load can be characterized by a first order nonlinear \ndifferential equation. In this paper, we numerically show that the system dynamics is sensitive to both \nthe initial condition and the system parameters. This implies that the system is chaotic and exhibits a \nbifurcation behavior. Moreover, the concentrations of the CD4 lymphocyte population, the CD8 \nlymphocyte population, the HIV-1 viral load and the dose are required to be non-negative and \nbounded, this implies that the positivity constraint of the system states and that of the dose \nconcentration is required to be satisfied [5]. Because of the chaotic nature of the system and the \npositivity constraint, the system is very difficult to be controlled. Furthermore, the system has two \nequilibrium points and one of them is unstable [1]. This implies that a very small derivation of the \nsystem vectors from the equilibrium point would cause the system trajectory to diverge locally. In \norder to control the concentration of the HIV-1 viral load being exactly equal to zero within a certain \nperiod of time, zero boundary conditions of the controlled system are required to be satisfied. \nHowever, it was reported in [7] that the corresponding linearized system (linearized at the unstable \nequilibrium point) is uncontrollable, so linear control methods would usually result to the loss of \ncontrol near the equilibrium point. \nThe simplest existing strategy for controlling the HIV-1 viral load is via the P control law [1], \n[2], [4], that is the dose concentration is directly proportional to the concentration of the HIV-1 viral \nload. However, this control strategy fails to satisfy the positivity constraint and in general this control \nmethod does not guarantee the asymptotical stability of the system. Optimal control methods [3], [6] \nare also proposed. However, all these control methods are derived based on the corresponding \nInternational Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos \n 3\nlinearized model, in which the system will lose control when the trajectory is close to the equilibrium \npoint [7]. \nAs the medications have strong side effects, medical professions would prefer to initiate the \ntherapy only at certain situations [7]. However, there is no standard rule for the determination of the \ntime instant that the therapy initiates. Also, the corresponding dose concentration is unknown. In this \npaper, we propose to initiate the therapy based on both the concentration of the HIV-1 viral load and \nthe ratio of the CD4 lymphocyte population to the CD8 lymphocyte population. If the concentration \nof the HIV-1 viral load is higher than a threshold, then the first type of therapy will be applied. If the \nconcentration of the HIV-1 viral load is lower than or equal to the threshold and the ratio of the CD4 \nlymphocyte population to the CD8 lymphocyte population is greater than another threshold, then the \nsecond type of therapy will be applied. Otherwise, no therapy will be applied. The advantages of the \nproposed control strategy are that the therapy can be stopped under certain conditions, while the state \nvariables of the overall system is asymptotically stable with fast convergent rate, the concentration of \nthe controlled HIV-1 viral load is monotonic decreasing, as well as the positivity constraint of the \nsystem states and that of the dose concentration is guaranteed to be satisfied. \nThe outline of this paper is as follows: The HIV model is reviewed in Section II. In Section III, \nthe sensitivity of the initial condition and the system parameters against the system dynamics is \nsimulated. The obtained results imply that the system is chaotic and exhibits a bifurcation behavior. In \nSection IV, a control strategy is proposed. Computer numerical simulation results are also presented. \nFinally, a conclusion is drawn in Section V. \n \nII. HIV MODEL \nDenote a , b , c , d , e  and f  as the system parameters, in which all are positive. Denote ( )tx , \n( )ty  and ( )tz  as the concentrations of the CD4 lymphocyte population, the CD8 lymphocyte \npopulation and the HIV-1 viral load, respectively. Denote 0x  and 0y  as the normal unperturbed \nInternational Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos \n 4\nconcentrations of the CD4 and CD8 lymphocyte population, respectively, in which they are also \npositive. The response of the concentrations of the CD4 lymphocyte population, the CD8 lymphocyte \npopulation and the HIV-1 viral load can be characterized by the following first order nonlinear \ndifferential equation [9]-[27]: \n ( ) ( )( ) ( ) ( )tztbxtxxatx \u2212\u2212= 0& , (1a) \n ( ) ( )( ) ( ) ( )tztdytyycty +\u2212= 0&  (1b) \nand \n ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )( )tfytextztz \u2212=& . (1c) \nIt can be checked easily that the equilibrium points of the system are \n [ ]Tyx 000  (2a) \nand \n ( ) ( )\n( ) T\nbfcyaedx\nfyexac\nbcadf\nbfcyaedx\nbcade\nbfcyaedx \u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1\n+\n\u2212\n+\n+\n+\n+\n00\n000000 . (2b) \n \nIII. SENSITIVITY OF INITIAL CONDITION AND SYSTEM PARAMETERS AGAINST \nSYSTEM DYNAMICS \nFigure 1a shows the state responses of the system, while Figure 1b shows the corresponding \nstate trajectory, in which 25.0=a , 50=b , 25.0=c , 10=d , 01.0=e , 006.0=f , 10000 =x , \n5500 =y , ( ) 00 xx = , ( ) 00 yy =  and ( ) 03.00 =z . It can be seen from Figure 1b that the system exhibits \na complex behavior. Figure 2 plots the Lyapunov exponents of the system at different time instants \nwith the system parameters being the same as that applied in Figure 1 and with the initial condition \nbeing the state vectors at the corresponding time instants. It can be seen from Figure 2 that the \nLyapunov exponent of ( )tz  is positive during the transient moment and at 15.4=t  year. Figure 3 \nplots the difference of the state responses between the following two sets of initial conditions with the \nsame set of system parameters applied in Figure 1: ( ) 4420 =x , ( ) 7360 =y  and ( ) 0063.00 =z , and its \nInternational Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos \n 5\n1% increment, that is ( ) 42.4460 =x , ( ) 36.7430 =y  and ( ) 0064.00 =z . It can be seen from Figure 3 \nthat the difference of the state responses between the above two sets of initial conditions are very \nlarge even though these two sets of initial conditions are differed only by 1%. This implies that the \nsystem is very sensitive to the initial condition. To investigate the sensitivity of the system parameters \nagainst the system dynamics, since there are six system parameters in the HIV model, namely, a , b , \nc , d , e  and f , the range of the concentrations of the CD4 lymphocyte population, CD8 lymphocyte \npopulation and the HIV-1 viral load are plotted with respect to these system parameters. Figure 4a, \nFigure 4b and Figure 4c plot the ranges of ( )tx , ( )ty  and ( )tz  as a  varies when 50=b , 25.0=c , \n10=d , 01.0=e , 006.0=f , 10000 =x , 5500 =y , ( ) 00 xx = , ( ) 00 yy =  and ( ) 03.00 =z . Similarly, \nFigure 5 to Figure 9 plot the corresponding ranges as the parameter b  to the parameter f vary, \nrespectively. From these computer numerical simulation results, we can see that the parameters d  \nand e  are the most sensitive to the system dynamics. Hence, we can conclude that the system is \nchaotic and exhibits a bifurcation phenomenon. This chaotic nature of the system causes the \nformulation of the control strategy being very challenging. \n \nIV. PROPOSED CONTROL STRATEGY \nDenote ( )tU  as the dose concentration. This corresponds to the control force of the system. \nAssume that ( )tU  is applying directly to ( )tz , that is: \n( ) ( )( ) ( ) ( )tztbxtxxatx \u2212\u2212= 0& , (3a) \n( ) ( )( ) ( ) ( )tztdytyycty +\u2212= 0&  (3b) \nand \n( ) ( ) ( ) ( )( ) ( )tUtfytextztz \u2212\u2212=& . (3c) \nConsider the following control force \n( ) ( )( ) ( )( )tfy\ntztxetU\n4\n22\n=  (4) \nand define \nInternational Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos \n 6\n( ) ( )( )2tztV = . (5) \nIt can be easily seen that ( ) 0>tV  for ( ) 0\u2260tz , and \n( ) ( ) ( ) ( )( )( )tfy\ntfytextztz\n4\n2 2\u2212\u2212=& . (6) \nConsequently, we have \n( ) ( )( ) ( ) ( )( )( )tfy\ntfytextztV\n2\n2 22 \u2212\u2212=& . (7) \nAs \n( ) ( )( ) ( ) ( )tztbxtxxatx \u2212\u2212= 0& , (8) \nwe have \n( ) ( )( )( )( ) \u239f\u23a0\u239e\u239c\u239d\u239b +\n\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b +\n=\n\u222b\n\u222b \u222b\n\u221e\u2212\n\u221e\u2212 \u221e\u2212\nt\nt\ndbza\nddbzaax\ntx\n\u03c4\u03c4\n\u03be\u03c4\u03c4\u03be\nexp\nexp0\n. (9) \nSimilarly, as \n( ) ( )( ) ( ) ( )tztdytyycty +\u2212= 0& , (10) \nwe have \n( ) ( )( )( )( ) \u239f\u23a0\u239e\u239c\u239d\u239b \u2212\n\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2212\n=\n\u222b\n\u222b \u222b\n\u221e\u2212\n\u221e\u2212 \u221e\u2212\nt\nt\nddzc\ndddzccy\nty\n\u03c4\u03c4\n\u03be\u03c4\u03c4\u03be\nexp\nexp0\n. (11) \nSince a , c , 0x  and 0y  are positive, from (9) and (11), we can conclude that ( ) 0>tx  and ( ) 0>ty  \n0\u2265\u2200t . By putting ( ) 0>ty  and 0>f  to (7), we can conclude that ( ) 0<tV&  0\u2265\u2200t . Since we \nassume that ( ) 00 >z , we have ( ) 0<tz&  0\u2265\u2200t , ( ) 0>tz  0\u2265\u2200t  and ( ) 0lim =+\u221e\u2192 tzt . By putting 0>f , \n( ) 0>ty  and ( ) 0>tz  to (4), we have ( ) 0>tU  0\u2265\u2200t . When ( ) 0\u2248tz  Tt \u2265\u2200 , where T  is a positive \nreal number, from (9) and (11), we have \n( ) ( )( ) ( )( )tTaxTxxtx \u2212\u2212+\u2248 exp00  (12) \nand \n( ) ( )( ) ( )( )tTcyTyyty \u2212\u2212+\u2248 exp00  Tt \u2265\u2200 . (13) \nInternational Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos \n 7\nSince a  and c  are positive, we have \n( ) 0lim xtxt \u2248+\u221e\u2192  (14) \nand \n( ) 0lim ytyt \u2248+\u221e\u2192 . (15) \nConsequently, both ( )tx  and ( )ty  are bounded and converge to the corresponding equilibrium values. \nHence, this control strategy can guarantee the asymptotical stability of the system, the monotonic \ndecrement of the concentration of the HIV-1 viral load, as well as the satisfaction of the positivity \nconstraint of the system states and that of the dose concentration. \nAlthough this control strategy guarantees that the system states will converge to the equilibrium \npoint, the convergent rate is slow because ( )tV  is independent of both ( )tx  and ( )ty . Now, consider \nanother control force as follows: \n( ) ( )( ) ( )( ) ( ) 3\n2\n01\n2\n0\n3\n2\n22\n424 k\nbxkyty\nk\ndk\ntfy\ntztxetU +\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2212+=  (16) \nand define \n( ) ( )( ) ( )( ) ( )( )23202201 tzktyyktxxktV +\u2212+\u2212= , (17) \nwhere 1k  and 2k  are non-negative constants as well as 3k  is a positive constant. Obviously, the \nprevious control strategy is a particular case of this control strategy. Now, we have \n( ) ( ) ( ) ( )( )( ) ( ) 3\n2\n01\n2\n0\n3\n2\n2\n424\n2\nk\nbxkyty\nk\ndk\ntfy\ntfytextztz \u2212\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212=&  (18) \nand \n( ) ( )( ) ( ) ( )( )( ) ( )( ) ( )( ) ( ) ( )\n( )\n22\n222\n2\n2 202\n2\n0\n1\n2\n01\n2\n02\n22\n3 ytdzkxtxtbzktxxaktyyck\ntfy\ntfytextzktV \u2212\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212=& .(19) \nIt can be checked easily that ( ) 0>tV  for ( ) ( ) ( )( ) ( )0,,,, 00 yxtztytx \u2260 . Similarly, from (9) and (11), we \nhave ( ) 0>tx  and ( ) 0>ty  0\u2265\u2200t . If ( ) 0>tz  0\u2265\u2200t , then ( ) 0>tU , ( ) 0<tV&  and ( ) 0<tz&  0\u2265\u2200t . \nHence, the success of this control strategy highly depends whether ( ) 0>tz  0\u2265\u2200t  or not. However, \nin general it is not guaranteed that ( ) 0>tz  0\u2265\u2200t  is satisfied even though this control strategy could \nachieve a fast convergent rate because ( )tV  depends on both ( )tx  and ( )ty . \nInternational Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos \n 8\nNow, consider an uncontrolled case, that is: \n( ) 0=tU . (20) \nDefine \n( ) ( )( )2tztV = , (21) \nthen we have \n( ) ( ) ( ) ( )( )tfytextztz \u2212=&  (22) \nand \n( ) ( )( ) ( ) ( )( )tfytextztV \u2212= 22& . (23) \nIt can be checked easily that ( ) 0>tV  for ( ) 0\u2260tz . Similarly, from (9) and (11), we have ( ) 0>tx  and \n( ) 0>ty  0\u2265\u2200t . If ( ) ( ) 0<\u2212 tfytex , then ( ) 0<tV& . Since we assume that ( ) 00 >z , we have ( ) 0<tz&  \n0\u2265\u2200t , ( ) 0>tz  0\u2265\u2200t  and ( ) 0lim =+\u221e\u2192 tzt . Similarly, we have ( ) 0lim xtxt \u2248+\u221e\u2192  and ( ) 0lim ytyt \u2248+\u221e\u2192 . Hence, \nthe success of the uncontrolled strategy highly depends whether ( ) ( ) 0<\u2212 tfytex  or not. However, in \ngeneral it is not guaranteed that ( ) ( ) 0<\u2212 tfytex  is satisfied even though the uncontrolled strategy \ndoes not require patients taking medications and patients do not need to tolerate the side effects of the \nmedications. \nNow, consider the following control strategy: \nTheorem 1 \nAssume that ( ) ( ) ( ) 00,0,0,,,,,,,,,,, 32100 >zyxkkkyxfedcba . Denote \u03b1  as a positive constant. \nCase I: If ( ) \u03b1>tz , then \n( ) ( )( ) ( )( ) ( ) 3\n2\n01\n2\n0\n3\n2\n22\n424 k\nbxkyty\nk\ndk\ntfy\ntztxetU +\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2212+= . \nCase II: If ( ) 0>\u2265 tz\u03b1  and ( ) ( ) 0\u2265\u2212 tfytex , then \n( ) ( )( ) ( )( )tfy\ntztxetU\n4\n22\n= . \nCase III: If ( ) 0>\u2265 tz\u03b1  and ( ) ( ) 0<\u2212 tfytex , then \n( ) 0=tU . \nInternational Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos \n 9\nThe overall controlled system is asymptotically stable, the concentration of the HIV-1 viral load is \nmonotonic decreasing, as well as the positivity constraint of the system states and that of the dose \nconcentration is guaranteed to be satisfied. \nProof: \nSince ( ) 0<tz&  for all these three cases and ( ) 00 >z , the system can only switch from Case I to \neither Case II or Case III, but not vice versa. If ( ) \u03b1\u22640z , then the system can only operate in Case II \nand Case III. If ( ) \u03b1>0z , as ( ) 0<tz& , ( )tz  is decreasing until it reaches the value \u03b1  and then switches \nto either Case II or Case III. Hence, the objective of the control strategy defined by Case I is to \naccelerate the transient response. Once the system is operating under the control strategy defined by \neither Case II or Case III, as ( ) 0<tV& , ( ) 0<tz& , ( ) 0>tx , ( ) 0>ty , ( ) 0>tz  and ( ) 0\u2265tU  0\u2265\u2200t  as well \nas ( ) 0lim xtxt \u2248+\u221e\u2192 , ( ) 0lim ytyt \u2248+\u221e\u2192  and ( ) 0lim =+\u221e\u2192 tzt  for both Case II and Case III, the positivity constraint \nof the system states and that of the dose concentration will be satisfied, the concentration of the HIV-1 \nviral load will be monotonic decreasing, as well as the asymptotical stability of the overall system \nwill be guaranteed. This completes the proof. \u2584 \nThere are four parameters in the controlled system, namely, \u03b1 , 1k , 2k  and 3k . Actually \nTheorem 1 is valid 0,,, 321 >\u2200 kkk\u03b1 . To design the value of \u03b1 , since \u03b1  is the concentration of the \nHIV-1 viral load in which the control strategy is switched from Case I to either Case II or Case III, and \nthe rate of the change of the concentration of the HIV-1 viral load under the control strategy defined \nby Case I is faster than that defined by Case II and Case III, \u03b1  should be small so that the \nconcentration of the HIV-1 viral load will decrease at a faster rate. However, as ( ) 0\u2260tz&  when \n( ) 0=tz , too small value of \u03b1  would cause a rapid change of the state trajectory near the equilibrium \npoint. Consequently, patients cannot stop the therapy. To obtain a balance between these two factors, \nwe choose \u03b1  to be a value equal to 59.5140% of ( )0z  in our computer numerical simulation, that is \n0.0179. For the values of 1k , 2k  and 3k , from (16), we see that ( )tU  is small if 1k  and 2k  are small \nand 3k  is large. In the practical situation, ( )tU  should be small so that the side effects of the \nInternational Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos \n 10\nmedications are negligible. However, we can see from (18) that the rate of change of the \nconcentration of the HIV-1 viral load is large if 1k  and 2k  are large and 3k  is small. As a fast response \nis preferred, there is a tradeoff between the strength of the side effects and the convergent rate of the \nsystem. To obtain a balance between these two factors, we propose to solve the problem via an \noptimization approach as follows: \nFor the control strategy defined by Case I, since \n( ) ( ) ( ) ( )( ) ( )( )( )\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( )( ) ( )\n( ) \u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b ++\u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1 \u2212\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2212=\nty\ntztxtxtztx\nf\ne\ntyf\ntztxeyty\nk\ndktytU &&&&\n22\n2\n22\n0\n3\n2 2\n442\n2  (24) \nand ( ) 0<tz&  0\u2265\u2200t , if ( ) 0<tx& , ( ) 0>ty&  and \n( ) ( )( ) ( )( )( )2\n22\n0\n3\n2\n42\n2\ntyf\ntztxeyty\nk\ndk <\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2212  ( ) \u03b1>\u2200 tz , \nthen we have ( ) 0<tU&  ( ) \u03b1>\u2200 tz . This implies that the maximum value of ( )tU  will occur at 0=t  if \nthe above conditions are satisfied. Define an acceptable bound on the dose concentration as maxU . \nThen 1k , 2k  and 3k  are designed such that ( ) maxUtU <  ( ) \u03b1>\u2200 tz . That is: \n( )( ) ( )\n( ) ( ) max3\n2\n01\n2\n0\n3\n2\n22\n42\n0\n04\n00 U\nk\nbxkyy\nk\ndk\nfy\nzxe <+\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2212+ . (25) \nSimilarly, we define an acceptable bound on the rate of change of the concentration of the HIV-1 viral \nload and on the rate of change of ( )tV  at 0=t  as maxz&  and maxV& , respectively. From (18) and (19), we \nhave \n( )\n( ) ( ) ( )( ) ( ) max3\n2\n01\n2\n0\n3\n22\n42\n0020\n04\n0 z\nk\nbxkyy\nk\ndkfyex\nfy\nz &<\u2212\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212  (26) \nand \n( )( )\n( ) ( ) ( )( ) ( )( ) ( )( ) ( ) ( )\n( )\nmax\n2\n02\n2\n0\n1\n2\n01\n2\n02\n2\n2\n3\n2\n0\n2\n0020202020\n02\n0 Vydzkxxbzkxxakyyckfyex\nfy\nzk &<\u2212\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212 .(27) \n(25)-(27), as well as 1k , 2k  and 3k  being positive, forms a linear matrix inequality constraint on  1k , \n2k  and 3k . For most of patients, maxU  should be set around 0.37. Hence, we choose maxU  accordingly. \nIn order to have a fast response, maxz&  and maxV&  should be as small as possible, hence we choose maxz&  \nInternational Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos \n 11\nand maxV&  as -0.15 and -0.0095, respectively. \nDue to the tradeoff between the strength of the side effects and the convergent rate of the system, \nwe formulate the following optimization problem as follows: \nProblem (P) \n( )321 ,,minkkk\n 321 kkk ++ , (28a) \nsubject to (25)-(27)  (28b) \nand 1k , 2k  and 3k  are positive. (28c) \nProblem P is a standard linear programming problem, many existing solvers, such as Matlab \noptimization toolbox, can be employed for solving the problem. Moreover, as this optimization \nproblem is convex, the obtained solution will be globally optimal if the feasible set is nonempty. \nFigure 10 plots the controlled state responses with the system parameters and the initial \ncondition being the same as those applied in Figure 1, where \u03b1 , 1k , 2k  and 3k  are determined based \non the above discussion. It can be seen from the figure that the concentration of the HIV-1 viral load is \nmonotonic decreasing, the system states asymptotically converge to the equilibrium point, as well as \nthe concentrations of the CD4 lymphocyte population, the CD8 lymphocyte population and the HIV-1 \nviral load are non-negative and bounded. Hence, the proposed control strategy satisfies the positivity \nconstraint. Figure 11 shows the corresponding dose concentration. It can be seen from the figure that \nthe maximum dose concentration within the first 4 weeks is 0.37, which satisfies the specification. \nThe dose concentration is monotonic decreasing within the first 4 weeks, but it drops dramatically to \nlow values after the 4th week because the system switches from the control strategy defined by Case \nI to that defined by Case II. Between the 85.7th and 219.7th weeks, the dose concentration is exactly \nequal to zero. This implies that the system switches to the control strategy defined by Case III and no \ntherapy is required. After the 219.7th week, the system switches back to the control strategy defined \nby Case II, so the dose concentration is non-zero and maintains at low level. To illustrate the \neffectiveness of the control strategy defined by Case I, Figure 12 plots the controlled state responses \nInternational Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos \n 12\nof the system switched only between Case II and Case III. Figure 13 plots the corresponding dose \nconcentration with the system parameters and the initial condition being the same as those applied in \nFigure 1. It can be seen from the figure that the concentration of the HIV-1 viral load decreases slowly \nwhile that based on the control strategy defined by Case I drops to the value equal to \u03b1  quickly (at \nthe 4th week). \n \nV. CONCLUSIONS \nIn this paper, we suggest to initiate the therapy based on both the concentration of the HIV-1 \nviral load and the ratio of the CD4 lymphocyte population to the CD8 lymphocyte population. If the \nconcentration of the HIV-1 viral load is higher than a threshold, then the first type of therapy will be \napplied. If the concentration of the HIV-1 viral load is lower than or equal to the threshold and the \nratio of the CD4 lymphocyte population to the CD8 lymphocyte population is greater than another \nthreshold, then the second type of therapy will be applied. Otherwise, no therapy will be applied. The \nadvantages of the proposed control strategy are that the therapy can be stopped under certain \nconditions, while the state variables of the overall system is asymptotically stable with fast \nconvergent rate, the concentration of the controlled HIV-1 viral load is monotonic decreasing, as well \nas the positivity constraint of the system states and that of the dose concentration is guaranteed to be \nsatisfied. \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \nThe work obtained in this paper was supported by a research grant from Queen Mary, \nUniversity of London. \n \nREFERENCES \n[1] Fernando Menezes Campello de Souza, \u201cModeling the dynamics of HIV-1 and CD4 and CD8 \nlymphocytes,\u201d IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology, vol. 18, no. 1, pp. 21-24, 1999. \nInternational Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos \n 13\n[2] Michael E.
