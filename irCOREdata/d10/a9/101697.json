The five key factors that \noperate in the knowledge force-field are found to be person, rules, position, ends and ideology. \nThe tourism literature is interrogated to demonstrate how these forces contribute to a double-\nselectivity in knowledge creation. Despite many truths being established, the whole truth about \ntourism is left untold resulting in gaps, silences and mis-constructions. Keywords: knowledge, \npower, truth, congruence, double-selectivity. \n \nINTRODUCTION  \nIs it possible to tell the truth about tourism? Surely an elaborate and expensive knowledge \nproduction system (universities, research departments, journals, conferences) exists just for that \npurpose. But could it be that the thousands of research articles that have been published have \nfailed to uncover the truth? Typically researchers view themselves as \u201clions in the jungle\u201d - \nuntrammeled and individualist researcher\/pioneers equipped to uncover the truth.  But maybe \ninstead researchers are lions in the circus - caged by role (Biddle 1979) and constrained by \nstructure? Furthermore a Marxist critique might locate tourism research as part of the Ideological \nState Apparatus (Althuser 1969). Here it would not engage in critical analysis but rather be part \nof a system in which the existing societal power and knowledge nexus is consolidated and \nperpetuated leading to the uncritical reproduction of the world as is.  \nIn response to these concerns this article holds the truth about tourism up for scrutiny. It \nis guided by a social constructionist (Burr 1995) approach to knowledge creation which \nconsiders the influences that impinge upon how, and what, knowledge is assembled. This \nencourages a critical stance towards knowledge and emphasizes the fact that research is \nconducted in a world where language, concepts and well-formed disciplinary rules already exist. \nThese are not universal but vary across time and place so that different cultural ensembles \nsustain different recipes for truth and knowledge. Since it is not possible to understand tourism \nprior to acculturation or outside of any culture, reflecting on cultural situatedness helps to \nunderstand the consequences of this fact. \nThe article poses questions succinctly raised by Said: \u201c\u2026how does one speak the truth? \nWhat truth? For whom and where?\u201d (1994:88). It approaches these questions around the \nconcepts of power and product. In studying power the article conceptualizes a knowledge force-\nfield and its constituent dimensions that influence the creation of truth. In analyzing product, it \nconsiders the effects of these forces on the knowledge that is created. In this way the degree of \ncongruence between the phenomenal world of tourism and its knowledge-constructed world is \nscrutinized. A key issue that emerges is whether there are factors at work defining the do-able in \ntourism research, legitimizing certain views and obscuring others.  \nOf course there already exists much discussion of knowledge difficulties in the social \nsciences. Notable milestones include the interpretive turn (Geertz 1973), the crisis in \nrepresentation (Marcus and Fisher 1986) and moments of qualitative research (Denzin and \n 2 \nLincoln 2003). But in tourism research, Riley and Love\u2019s (2000) study and Phillimore and \nGoodson\u2019s update which found that \u201cexplicit examinations of researchers\u2019 embodied \ncharacteristics continue to be rare in tourism studies\u201d (2004:16), portray the limited engagement \nwith contemporary issues of knowledge production. Furthermore, Botterill, Gale and Haven \nnoted for UK doctoral studies that \u201cthere was little sign of any explicit engagement with \nepistemological debate as evidenced by the use of the term itself or its principle form of \nexpression in the Social Sciences, that is, the terms \u2018Constructivism\u2019 and \u2018Realism\u2019 \u201d(2003:293).  \n \nTHE TRUTH ABOUT TOURISM \nThis article is primarily conceptual and the limited empirical aspects are based upon two \ntypes of source. First data is used from the literature. Second, use is made of the CABI \nPublishing abstracts database (CABABS). CABABS was interrogated to provide data on \npublished articles using search criteria relating to the ideas discussed in the paper. Either the \nspecific year 2002 (1,127 tourism articles abstracted) or the range of years 1990 \u2013 2002 inclusive \n(12,175 articles abstracted) are used to provide evidence. Three limitations to this method should \nbe noted.  First, only titles, keywords and abstracts are interrogated and therefore there may be \nsome underepresentation of articles which declare their orientation only in the main body of their \ntext. Second, the existence of many synonyms means that searches for concepts under a \nparticular word may miss some potential positive cases. Third, CABABS only abstracts literature \nclassified as tourism. Therefore literature logged elsewhere (under anthropology, management, \netc.) is overlooked. \n \nThe knowledge force-field \nIt was Lewin (1935) who elaborated the theory of force-fields in order to understand those \nfactors which facilitated and those which restrained change in organizations. For this article \nforce-field analysis is used to understand those factors that resist and those that promote truth \ncreation in tourism. The term \u201cknowledge force-field\u201d is used to describe those factors which \nmediate in the process where the phenomenal world of tourism is translated into the known \nworld of tourism. This can be illustrated by the following simple transformation: \n \nTourism Phenomenon \u0001\u0002 Knowledge Force-Field \u0001\u0002Tourism Knowledge \nSo what is of interest here is the congruence between tourism knowledge and the tourism \nphenomenon. A scoping of the literature reveals a long list of theories relating to power and \nknowledge, particularly influenced by the sociology of knowledge (Mannheim 1960), \nphenomenology (Husserl 1913), discourse (Foucault 1971), representation (Said 1994) and \nreproduction (Bourdieu 1973). In order to bring some conceptual clarity, the theories have been \nordered around five over-arching factors. The five factors at work in the knowledge force-field \nare person, rules, position, ends and ideology. Figure 1 illustrates the relationship between the \nphenomenal world of tourism (circle 1) and the canon of tourism knowledge (circle 3), mediated \nthrough the knowledge force field (circle 2). Of course the five factors are not discrete forces and \nthere are many overlaps and inter-relationships. For this reason they are not identified in separate \nboxes and the knowledge force field is depicted as a fluid space. Additionally, circle 1 is drawn \nwithout hard borders for we can not know what its borders are. Tourism is more than can be told.  \nEach of the categories in the knowledge force-field will now be examined in turn and the general \nline of enquiry will focus on the extent to which circle 3 provides a comprehensive \nrepresentation of tourism (circle 1).  \n \n \n 3 \n \nFigure 1. The Knowledge Force-Field \n \nPerson.  Identifying person as a substantive power in the knowledge force field confronts the \nstrange but deeply established notion that research is somehow disembodied. Perhaps it is the \npursuit of objectivity in research that has been responsible for denying the place and power of \nwhat Swain calls \u201cthe corporal selves of researchers ... as primary factors in the research \nprocess\u201d (2004:102). A deeply entrenched mind \/ body dichotomy has prevailed in tourism \nresearch where an objective mind has been cultivated as if it was detached and immune from any \nbodily impressions. The following section highlights significant aspects of embodiment \nincluding class, age, (dis)ability, gender, sexual orientation, race and ethnicity. \nThe notion of self (Wearing and Wearing 2001) (or selves - Reinharz 1997) is initially, \nartificially and temporarily extracted from those aspects of nurture or culture that impress \nthemselves upon identity. For as Hall notes, \u201cin terms of why we research what we do, one also \ncannot ignore the personal\u201d (2004:148). Hall provides examples of this notably that \u201ca woman \nwho [he] lusted after\u201d influenced his choice of doctorate. Additionally he explains how good and \nbad relationships with colleagues, institutions and publishers and his loves of surfing, the \noutdoors, wine and food have influenced his research choices. Sayer also stresses the \nsignificance of self and \u201cThe realm of the 'I' - that is our capability to receive something from \noutside and make it our own, to make something of what we are constructed through - thus \ncreating something different\u201d (1999:3). In an illustration of this, Botterill (2003) deploys an \nautoethnographic approach which reveals the interplay of self with research. He recounts his \nepistemological journey from positivism (his initial received or given perspective) via social \nconstructivism and phenomenology to critical realism. This he interweaves with a personal \nnarrative that includes breakdown, divorce, relocation, disputation, politics, love and the \ndiscovery of his own \u201cWelshness\u201d.  \nHall and Botterill have foregrounded the importance of the self in influencing both the \nfocus of the researcher\u2019s gaze (Hollinshead 1999b) into circle 1 and the consequential \nknowledges constructed in circle 3. Ateljevic, Harris, Wilson and Collins (2005) similarly reveal \ntheir \u201centanglements\u201d in the process of research whilst Galani-Moutafi (2000) explains the \nimportance of self-knowledge in the construction of knowledge about others. It is notable that \nalthough reflexivity is becoming more common in interpretivist research, the self is generally \nignored (or often banished) in tourism research. For example the \u201cI\u201d word is proscribed from \nmany journals (including Annals), presumably in deference to scientific objectivity.  \n 4 \nAnalysis of the power of gender (Pritchard 2004; Wearing 1998) in the knowledge force-\nfield includes Aitchison\u2019s (2001b) review of the interface between structural and cultural power \nin the construction of gender relations and gendered others in tourism. In an earlier paper, \nAitchison (1996) found that research and consultancy, publications, professional associations, \neducational management, and teaching were key mechanisms by which patriarchal power and \ncontrol are exerted in leisure and tourism. She showed these mechanisms to be crucial to the \nconstruction of knowledge and its communication, legitimation and reproduction. Aitchison\u2019s \n(2001a) gender analysis of authors in journals in leisure and tourism studies found that male \nauthors outnumbered female authors by four to one supporting the argument that knowledge \ncreation has a significant gender dimension. Similarly, Pritchard and Morgan (2000) demonstrate \nhow tourism landscapes are shaped by the discourses of patriarchy and heterosexuality and that \nthe language of tourism promotion is scripted for a male, heterosexual audience and Johnston \n(2001) criticizes the hegemonic, disembodied and masculinist knowledge of tourism. \nIt is notable that in the Meyer-Arendt and Justice (2002) review of dissertation topics \nonly one out of a total of 377 was classified under women\u2019s studies and there are few examples \nin the literature which deploy an overtly feminist methodology. Indeed CABABS reveals the \nterm FEMINIS* (Feminist \/ Feminism) in the summaries of only 19 of 12,175 entries in its \n1990-2002 database. Additionally Aramberri\u2019s (2002) report notes that the delegates at the 2001 \nInternational Academy for the Study of Tourism Conference were (as in most tourism \nconferences) almost all male. Similarly, of the 57 contributors listed in Lew, Hall and Williams\u2019s \n(2004) A Companion to Tourism only 10 are women. However despite evidence of an \noverwhelming patriarchal power at work and perhaps in illustration of the Foulcauldian notion of \nresistance, an oeuvre of gender research is evident. This includes the 1995 special issue of \nAnnals of Tourism Research - Gender in Tourism and the 2003 special issue of Tourism \nRecreation Research - Gender Tourism. The editors of the latter - Hall, Swain and Kinnaird  - \nare able to state that \u201ca transnational network of researchers focusing on gender dimensions of \nTourism Studies has developed over the past decade\u201d (2003:7) but note \u201crelatively little \nengagement to date between feminist studies and tourism studies in the development of gender \nthinking in tourism\u201d (2003:11). \nHumberstone\u2019s introduction to standpoint research notes that the \u201cproduction of \nknowledge and development of theory was in the past largely based upon Eurocentric research \nand the ideas of mainly white middle class men\u201d (2004:119). She then adverts to the groups\u2014\n\u201cwomen, black people, people with disability\u201d (2004:119)\u2014whose perspectives and experiences \nhave been neglected. Humberstone alludes to the \u201cnaming of a feminist standpoint \nepistemology\u201d (2004:120) and it has been seen that feminist standpoints such as those of \nAitchison (2001a; 2001b) provide insights into the power dynamics of tourism research.  With \nregard to sexual orientation and research 48 articles (0.004% of total) are returned from \nCABABS (1990 \u2013 2002) using the search strings GAY or QUEER or HOMOSEXUAL* \n(Homosexual \/ Homosexuality) or LESBIAN. There is only limited evidence of a literature \nwhich considers the power dynamics of sexual orientation on research and knowledge creation \nincluding Clift, Luongo and Callister\u2019s (2002) collection on gay tourism culture and identity, \nHughes\u2019s (1997) study of homosexual identity and Chamberland\u2019s (2000) study of Canadian \nlesbian travelers. In the light of such observations Valentine (1993) offers the term \n\u2018heteropatriarchy\u2019 to describe the sociosexual power relations that feed male, heterosexual \ndominance. \n   Turning to ethnicity, race, disability and class, an inspection of the 374 (0.03% of total) \ntitles returned from a CABABS search (1990-2002) using the search strings RACE and \/ or \nETHNIC* (Ethnic \/ Ethnicity), the 69 (0.006% of total) that include the search string DISAB* \n 5 \n(Disabled \/ Disability) and the 4 (0.00038% of total) titles using the search strings \u201cSOCIAL \nCLASS\u201d or MARX* (Marx, Marxist, Marxian, Marxism) reveals that although these issues are \nresearched there appears to be no research explicitly standpointed from non-white or disabled or \nspecific class perspectives. Neither do we have a clear idea of the number of researchers \/ \nresearch outputs that are non-white, disabled or working class. \nThis section is concluded by revisiting Veijola and Jokinen who noted that \u201cjudged by the \ndiscursive postures given to the writing subject of most of the analyses, the analyst himself has ... \nlacked a body\u201d (1994:149). In the judgment of Swain (2004) their challenge has not been taken \nup in the ensuing years. Swain\u2019s conclusion is that \u201cif bodies are invisible or silenced in \nqualitative research, we are missing a very rich source of data and denying a method of \ninvestigation that acknowledges the researcher\u2019s complicity in knowledge building\u201d (2004:116). \nOf course the researcher\u2019s body is routinely repressed in positivist research.  \n \nRules. The rules in tourism knowledge creation consist of those conventions that researchers \nsubscribe to and work within. Concepts analyzed will include (multi\/inter) disciplinarity, \nparadigms, postmodernity, traditions, discourse and methodology and a concern here is that \nknowledge may be subject to MacDonaldizing tendencies (Ritzer 1993) where standardized \nprocedures are invoked to produce a uniform, predictable product.  There may be parallel \ndangers of following a \u201crecipe\u201d approach to tourism research. For recipes militate against \nheterogeneity, nuances may be lost and research products may be mass-produced without due \nregard to their sensitivity to different contexts. \nA good starting point is to examine the rules supplied by a particular disciplinary \napproach (Tribe 1997). A discipline is often seen as a cornerstone of truth creation since its rules \nhave been established and perfected over a long period with a view to underwriting the reliability \nand validity of research. However disciplines may perform a selector role determining what is \nincluded and excluded both in the framing of tourism research and its execution. Here, \nAronowitz and Giroux (1991) refer to the tyranny of the disciplines. So where a particular \ndiscipline predominates in a field it can literally discipline both perception and knowledge \ncreation. Sayer describes the parochialism of disciplines where \u201cthey tend to be incapable of \nseeing beyond the questions posed by their own discipline, which provide an all-purpose filter \nfor everything\u201d (1999:2).  For Sayer then, disciplines can offer \u201ca recipe for misunderstanding \nthe social world\u201d (1999:1). \nJafari and Aaser\u2019s (1988) analysis of doctoral dissertations completed in the USA found \nthe largest contributions from the fields of economics, anthropology, geography, and recreation, \nin that order of importance. In Meyer-Arendt and Justice\u2019s (2002) study of US dissertations, 26% \nwere classified under recreation and 13% each under anthropology and geography. Economics \naccounted for 7% and sociology 3% of the approaches. Botterill et al\u2019s analysis of UK \ndissertations \u201cconfirm[s] the influences of economics, geography, sociology, anthropology, \nbusiness studies and environmental science upon the study of tourism\u201d (2003:292). \nA crude analysis of the 2002 tourism research recorded in CABABS underlines the \npredominance of economics appearing in 38% of the title, keywords or abstract, followed by \nsociology with 7%, geography with 6%, psychology with 3%, and philosophy and anthropology \neach with 1%. Rojek and Urry identify the tyrannical role of economics which \u201cdeliberately \u2026 \nabstract[s] most of the important issues of social and cultural practice and only consider[s] \ntourism as a set of economic activities. Questions of taste, fashion and identity would thus be \nviewed as exogenous to the system\u201d (1997:2). Similarly, Franklin and Crang comment that \ntourism has tended to be reduced to a set of economic activities, so that \u201cour understanding of \ntourism has become fetishized as a thing, a product, a behaviour \u2013 but in particular an economic \n 6 \nthing\u201d (2001:6). Mindful of such observations Coles, Hall and Duval make a case for post-\ndisciplinarity arguing that if studies of tourism are to reflect contemporary conditions \u201cthey \nshould move away from traditional inter- and multi-disciplinary approaches to more flexible \nforms of knowledge production\u201d (2005:31). \nRules can build into paradigms. For Kuhn (1970) a paradigm represents \u201caccepted \nexamples of actual scientific practice \u2026 from which spring particular coherent traditions of \nscientific research\u201d (1970:10). Kuhn demonstrated that adherents to any period of \u201cnormal \nscience\u201d often fought hard to protect the coherence of an existing paradigm against emerging \nsubversive theory. Paradigms set the rules and define the boundaries of the acceptable in \nknowledge creation and represent an important power dimension acting on research. \nBut it is not possible to present tourism research as operating in the grip of a paradigm. \nMuch of Kuhn\u2019s analysis describes an age where patronage and the monopolization of \nknowledge were rife and the communication of ideas was tightly controlled. Denial and \nsuppression of new truths was therefore feasible. This is clearly not the case in the postmodern \n(Lyotard 1984) truth free-for-all. Additionally the simple example of Franklin and Crang \ndemonstrates the situation in tourism. In order to promote an angle of research which they felt \nhas been overlooked they were able to take a simple step and launch a new journal (Tourist \nStudies) \u201cwhich provides a platform for the development of critical perspectives on the nature of \ntourism as a social phenomenon\u201d (Franklin and Crang 2001:6). Importantly for understanding \nthe weakness of paradigms, this step did not lead to their excommunication from the tourism \nacademy. \nHowever if Kuhn\u2019s idea of paradigms is too strong to have explanatory power for the \nknowledge force field, MacIntyre\u2019s (1985) idea of traditions does offer some insight. A tradition \nis a looser constellation of rules than a paradigm. Traditions arise as researchers build on \nprecedent and attract adherents who subscribe to similar schools of thought. They differ from \nparadigms in that a number of different traditions may freely co-exist and they are more \npermeable and adaptable. Jafari (2003) identifies phases in tourism research that point to \nchanging traditions noting that early studies concentrated on economic aspects of. The next \nphase focused on sociocultural aspects, scrutinizing the benefits of tourism. Thereafter, Jafari \nnotes that research was devoted to alternative forms of tourism which were potentially more \nsustainable.  \nRules are more subtle yet no less powerful in the Foulcauldian notion of discourse \n(Foucault 1971; 1980). Here the rules of admissibility (what can and cannot be said) are much \nless overtly policed than in a paradigm. Rather they are dissipated and deeply embedded into \nsocial relations. Hall (1997:44) explains discourse as \"a group of statements which provide a \nlanguage for talking about ...a particular topic at a particular historical moment.\"  Hall further \nexplains that Foucault was interested in the rules and practices that gave statements meaning and \nregulated what could be said. Discursive formations perform an including and excluding \nfunction, legitimizing what counts as knowledge and what does not, so that the ideas and \ninterests of some groups are given authority whilst those of others are not supported. Discourse \nthereby has the ability to construct (circle 3, Figure 1) tourism (circle 1, figure 1). In this way the \ndiscourses within which we operate can determine what we enable ourselves to know. Cheong \nand Miller (2000) emphasize the productive effects of power demonstrated in formation of \nknowledge in the field of tourism, but it appears that as a group, researchers in the field are not \nvery Foucault aware \u2013 only 8 of the 12175 CABABS articles (1990-2002) returned the search \nstring FOUCAUL* (Foucault \/ Foucauldian) in their summaries. However it is also notable that \nthe derivative concept of the \u201cgaze\u201d generates a higher count being evident in 35 articles. \n 7 \nWhat is interesting about discourse is that it can sustain a regime of truth about tourism \nirrespective of any absolute truth. As an example of this Hughes (1995) shows that that the \ndominant approach to sustainable tourism is technical, rational and scientific. He argues that this \ndiscourse has silenced the emergence of an ethical response to sustainability. In other words the \nterm sustainable tourism has been formed and maintained through the emergence of a particular \ndiscourse. Hollinshead (1999b) in reviewing Urry\u2019s (1990; 1992) conceptualization of the tourist \ngaze explains how the Foucauldian eye-of-power acts not only through the organizations and \nagencies of travel and tourism but also in travel and tourism research \u201c\u2026 that is the way its \nmembers learn to see and project preferred versions of reality, and historically the way that such \nseeing and projecting privileges certain persons and their inheritances, and subjugates certain \nothers and their inheritances\u201d (1999b:9). \nIn this light circle 2 in Figure 1 might represent the lens of the eye of power and circle 3 \nits retina: the segment ABC in circle 3 \u201cwhat \u2026 we repeatedly and systematically privilege in \ntourism representations\u201d and the segment AZC \u201cwhat we \u2026 systematically deny and frustrate\u201d \n(Hollinshead 1999b:15). The Figure\u2019s explanatory power can be extended by positing that the \nmovement between circle 1 and circle 3 is not neutral but that the throwing of the gaze from \ncircle 2 (e.g. from K to J) includes \u201centrenched a priori understandings in or of cultural, \nenvironmental matters and preformulated understandings about \u2026 a distant interpreted \npopulation\u201d (Hollinshead 1999:17, italics added for emphasis).  \nHowever the cacophony of antagonistic voices makes it difficult to maintain the case for \na discourse of tourism research, although it does seem possible to identify certain dominant \ndiscursive formations. For example managerialism offers a powerful discourse disciplining \ntourism truth. Ball (1990:156) suggests that \"management is a professional, professionalizing \ndiscourse\u201d. In other words it provides the rules which authorize certain ways of talking about \ntourism and proscribes others resulting in knowledge which generally includes issues such as \nconsumer satisfaction, efficiency and markets and excludes issues such as mobilities, gender and \npower-politics. However Foucault observed that \u201cwhere there is power there is resistance\u201d \n(1980:95) and the multiple discourses that run through tourism provide sites for resistance. It \nappears that Franklin and Crang wish to provide a site for resistance against managerialism  \nwhen they ask contributors to Tourist Studies to (among other things) \u201c\u2026 stimulate approaches \nto the study of tourism which provide an alternative to the existing positivist, managerially \noriented material which predominates in the current literature on tourism. These approaches may \ninclude qualitative, humanistic and ethnographic methodologies and feminist and ethnic \nperspectives on tourism\u201d (2001:15).  \nFinally this section turns to the rules of different methods and their impact on truth \ntelling. Typically research is divided into positivist and interpretivist approaches. It is likely that \nthose who work in the scientific positivist traditions of tourism research will instinctively deny \nthe idea of a knowledge force-field. They will replace the term knowledge force-field with the \nterm \u201cscientific method\u201d and proffer a different transformation to the one proposed earlier: \n \nTourism Phenomenon \u0001\u0002 Scientific Method \u0001\u0002 Tourism Knowledge \n \nThe claim can then be made that it is precisely the careful, methodical rules and permitted \nmoves of scientific method that ensure that there is an exact correspondence between tourism \nknowledge (circle 3) and that part of the tourism phenomenon it seeks to describe (circle 1). \nSuch considerations include those of hypothesis formulation, hypothesis \ncorroboration\/falsification, validity, reliability and objectivity. Indeed it is by this process that a \n 8 \nnumber of truths in tourism have been established. So for example Song, Romilly and Liu\u2019s \n(2000) empirical study of outbound tourism demand in the UK found that the long-run \nincome elasticities for the destinations studied range from 1.70 to 3.90. Hard knowledge \nproduction such as this may tempt those working under the demanding rules of scientific \npositivism to claim their credentials as truth tellers. But methodological considerations suggest \nthat this accolade should be qualified. Positivists must also be viewed as constrained truth tellers \nfor two reasons. First, there are only limited parts of the phenomenon of tourism that are \namenable to investigation by positivist method (mainly that which is measurable). A huge part of \nthe potential canvas of tourism truth is left uncharted by this approach (for example emotions, \naesthetics and values) so that \u201cit becomes impossible to examine \u2018reality\u2019 in all its complexity\u201d \n(Walle 1997:535). Second, positivism is not choice-free. Researchers have to choose what \nresearch to conduct and when choosing, their gaze (K \u0002J, Figure 1) is not exempt from the \ninfluence of the knowledge force-field.  \nAn important tenet of interpretivism is that \u201cthe complex social world can be understood \nonly from the point of view of those who operate within it\u201d (Goodson and Phillimore 2004:36). \nHere a common aim is to \u201clet your data do the talking\u201d (Jordan and Gibson 2004:215). \nInterpretivist methods thereby seek to offer a naturalistic voice to the tourism phenomena \nstudied. As such they often offer conflicting, confusing and highly context-bound and messy \naccounts. These truths may be challenged from positivists as lacking reliability or validity. \nInterpretivists have responded to such criticisms by creating different truth-criteria appropriate to \ntheir approach such as confirmability, trustworthiness and transparency.  \nAs to the relative significance of these methods, some early writers were pessimistic \nabout the direction tourism research was taking. For example, Echtner and Jamal noted that \u201c\u2026 \nthe evolution of tourism studies might be seen to be plagued by the same phobia that dominates \nall of the social sciences, namely the need to become more \u201cscientific\u201d and the resulting \nattachment to more traditional positivist methods\u201d (1997:877). In the same year, Ryan asked \nwhether tourism researchers are \u201centrenched in a positivist tradition that was blinding us to \ndevelopments in other social sciences\u201d (1997:3). Additionally, Riley and Love\u2019s (2000) \ninvestigation into the number of quantitative versus qualitative articles appearing in four tourism \njournals from their inception to 1996 found the dominant method in tourism journals to be \npositivism. However Dann and Phillips (2001) have reported a recent trend where tourism \nresearch is moving away from pure quantification and towards a more qualitative approach and \nJamal and Hollinshead note that \u201cfoundationalist assumptions of truth, objectivity, and validity \nare being slowly relinquished\u201d (2001:63). The increasing presence of qualitative studies is \nendorsed by Botterill et al\u2019s (2003) analysis of UK dissertations. This \u201cconfirms the prevailing \ninfluence of positivist (questionnaire) and hermeneutic (interview) epistemologies in the study of \ntourism\u201d (2003:293) and that quantitative \u2026 and qualitative \u2026 methods were reported in \nroughly equal proportions\u201d (2003:288). \n \nPosition. The term position describes the location of the researcher encompassing physical \nlocation such as geographical situatedness, and positioning within a university department as \nwell as location within an academic community and a wider language and cultural community. \nWhen squeezed with a critical grip the seemingly innocuous concept of geographical location \nyields up its underlying power dimensions. Here, ethnocentricity, departmentalism and academic \ntribalism all emerge as important forces at work in the tourism knowledge force-field.   \nEthnocentrism involves the promotion of the interests of one\u2019s own ethnic and cultural \ngroup, and a corresponding demotion of those of other groups. This gives rise to the question as \n 9 \nto the degree to which the subaltern is allowed to speak (Aitchison 2001) and the ability of \nresearchers to present the story of others (Spivak 1987). Hooks (1990) illustrates the subtle way \nin which the voice of the subaltern is inevitably subverted by researchers: \nNo need to hear your voice when I can talk about you better than \nyou can speak about yourself. No need to hear your voice. Only \ntell me about your pain. I want to know your story. And then I will \ntell it back to you in a new way. Tell it back to you in such a way \nthat it has become mine, my own. Re-writing you, I write myself \nanew. I am still author, authority. I am still the colonizer, the \nspeaking subject, and you are now at the centre of my talk. \n(1990:151-152) \n \nMetropolitanism describes the situation where the promoted interests are those of the \nmother country as opposed to its (former) colonies and Bhabha (1996) discusses the power of \npost-colonialism. Blomgren and Sorensen (1998) identify the geographic dichotomies of core \nversus peripherality noting that peripheral areas can find it difficult to promote or protect their \ninterests. The dominance of core areas is illustrated by Hall, Williams and Lew\u2019s (2004) analysis \nof the global distribution of tourism journal editors which found 77% of editors based in the \nUSA, UK, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. \nHollinshead (1999a) argues that the interests of certain privileged groups are served by \npost-modern \u201cnationalist\u201d tourism so that significant truths created are those relevant to the \ntourist rather than the host, consumers rather than workers and the industry rather than the \nenvironment. Note that each of these dichotomies identifies the interests of a dominant against a \nsubservient group. In an earlier paper, Hollinshead (1992) attempts to counter the power of \nethnocentric Western portrayals of indigenous North Americans. He does this by a process of \nwhat he terms disidentification. This involves promoting the acceptance of the validity and logic \nof native North Americans' own alternative visions of the world thereby recognizing (and \nrelinquishing) the power that authors may bring from geographic situatedness. Similarly, Dyer, \nAberdeen and Schuler (2003) reflect on the effects of their historical identity on the research \nprocess and the interpretation of data in their study of the indigenous Australian Djabugay \ncommunity. \n Whittaker\u2019s (1999) study illustrates the issue of geographic situatedness and ethnocentrism in \nAustralia and the challenge of reclaiming knowledge for indigenous people (aboriginal \nAustralians). He finds that the depiction of aboriginals in tourist literature is exploitative and \nracist, based upon and perpetuating historicized images of aboriginal groups. In other words \nknowledge about an indigenous people is generated from an ethnocentric (Western, developed, \ncolonial) position. The knowledge which is offered about them is different to the knowledge they \nwould offer about themselves. This is similar to Said\u2019s (1978) conceptualisation of the Western \nview of the East as \u201cOrientalism\u201d where the view of the Arab and Islamic world is skewed by a \nWestern gaze.  Tuhiwai Smith (1999), a Maori researcher offers an insight about how research \nand the truth are viewed by the colonised:  \nFrom the vantage point of the colonised, a position from which I \nwrite, and choose to privilege, the term \u2018research\u2019 is inextricably \nlinked to European imperialism and colonialism. The word itself, \n\u2018research\u2019, is probably one of the dirtiest words in the Indigenous \nworld\u2019s vocabulary. When mentioned in many Indigenous \ncontexts, it stirs up silence, it conjures up bad memories, it raises a \nsmile that is knowing and distrustful (1999:1). \n 10 \nSimilarly, Berno and Butler\u2019s (1996) study of the Cook Islands adverts to ethnocentric issues in \nresearch methods and the fact that cultural differences can make it difficult to achieve a \nprojection of reality that is meaningful to indigenous people in their cultural context. (In Figure \n1, would the Cook Islanders in circle 1 subscribe to the projection of themselves offered in circle \n3?).  \nNgugi locates language as a cause of self-othering:  \n[t]he choice of language and the use to which language is put is \ncentral to a people's definition of themselves in relation to their \nnatural and social environment . . . by our continuing to write in \nforeign languages, paying homage to them, are we not on the \ncultural level continuing that neo-colonial slavish and cringing \nspirit? (1986:4, 26). \nIn an effort to counter ethnocentrism based around the dominance of the English language in \ntourism research Franklin and Crang (2001:15) set out specifically \u201cto stimulate a wider global \ndebate about the nature of tourism by encouraging submissions [to the journal Tourist Studies] \nfrom non-English-speaking authors.\u201d \nMoving from the national to the local, the term \u201cdepartmentalism\u201d is coined here to \ndescribe the organizational effects of universities on research. Typically tourism researchers are \nlocated within Business Schools (Surrey, UK, Otago, NZ) or Geography Departments (Exeter, \nUK) or more purposively conceived ones such as The Department of Recreation Parks and \nTourism (University of Florida, USA). These structures have immense power to direct time, \nsupply funds and corral research to fit a particular faculty strategy and Hall laments \u201cAcademic \nfreedom is a mirage. If I do not meet the research \u2026 performance criteria which are set  \u2026 I may \nnot get a pay rise, or perhaps in the longer term I may even lose my job\u201d (2004:147). \nBotterill offers an insightful account of the impact of different University regimes on his \nown research. \u201cAt [Texas A&M] I had encountered the epitome of  \u2026 \u2018technical useful \nknowledge\u2019 that emanates under institutionalized positivism\u201d (Botterill 2003:100). Botterill \nexplains that this approach was \u201cso visible, so normal\u201d that his comments often appeared as \n\u201cheretic\u201d and how a move to a \u201csocial science subject group at a small college \u2026 brought [him] \nup sharply against the influence of Marxian thought\u201d (2003:103) whilst later employment at a \n\u201c\u2018vocational\u2019 university \u2026 [made] it difficult to retain a high profile in a critical network\u201d \n(2003:103). These effects are illustrated in Hollinshead\u2019s stinging critique which describes how \n\u201cthe institutionalized person cum disciplinary member is gradually generalised into homo docilis, \nan obedient, conscience-ridden, pliable and appropriate representative of that agency\u201d \n(1999b:14). Here, Hollinshead seeks to make those involved in tourism (including researchers) \nmore other-regarded (and also self-aware) in terms of the governing suppositions and \npresuppositions they work within. \nResearchers are also located within academic communities and Becher's (1989) \nanthropological investigation of \"academic tribes\" provides a fascinating insight into acceptable \nbehavior patterns, rules, norms and hierarchies operating within disciplinary communities. \nFollowing Becher it is instructive to consider aspects of academic tribalism in tourism. Of \nparticular interest are the \"elders\" of the tourism tribe whose headdresses are adorned with \nfeathers of esteem \u2013 holding of chairs, editorships of key journals, keynote invitations, seats on \npanels of research grant and assessment bodies, publishers\u2019 advisory positions, and positions on \nthe executives of learned and professional associations. For \u201celders\u201d one could also read \u201cpower-\nbrokers\u201d for this group act as commissioners in the creation of, and gate-keepers in the \ndissemination of tourism knowledge (McKercher 2002). \n \n 11 \nEnds. The purpose of knowledge also exerts an important influence on what truths researchers \nseek. Ideas at work here include questions of demand (the \u201cfor whom?\u201d question), funding and \nends. A useful starting point here is the notion of the commodification. This describes how \nresearch is packaged just like any other commodity in response to the needs of the market so that \nit is produced to take advantage of its exchange value. Commodification of research may result \nfrom the increasing influence of commercialization agendas on universities where they are \nexpected to move towards greater self-financing.  \nHabermas\u2019s (1978) theory of knowledge constitutive interests offers a useful mapping \naround the idea of commodification. Habermas argued that the pursuit of knowledge is never \ninterest-free but rather that human enquiry is motivated by one of three interests. The technical \ninterest seeks control and management, the purpose being improving technique. Next, the \npractical interest seeks understanding, the purpose being deep insight. Third, the emancipatory \ninterest seeks freedom from falsehood and emancipation from oppression, the purpose being \nimprovement of the human condition. Habermas additionally explains that each of these interests \nis served by a different research paradigm. Scientific positivism serves the technical, interpretive \nmethods seek understanding and critical theory seeks emancipation. \nFollowing Habermas it may be assumed that research for the tourism industry mainly \nserves a technical interest. But the influence of business and on tourism research is far from \nclear. Whilst Ritchie (2000) notes that the academic literature has had few links with or impact \non tourism practitioners, Franklin and Crang argue that \u201c\u2026 tourist studies has been dominated \nby policy led and industry sponsored work so the analysis tends to internalize industry led \npriorities and perspectives\u201d (2001:5). Cooper explains how in Australia \u201cthe Cooperative \nResearch Centre for Sustainable Tourism \u2026 has taken the lead \u2026 [in] working out detailed \ncommercialization and diffusion strategies for research projects\u201d (2002:43). Research driven by a \ntechnical interest necessarily concentrates on a small part of the tourism phenomenon. Its main \nconcerns will be consumer satisfaction and the planning and management of resources. \nLyotard\u2019s (1984) concept of performativity further illustrates commodification. He argues \nthat as science becomes more complex its research requires increasingly technologically \nsophisticated laboratories. The importance of this is that \"\u2026 an equation between wealth, \nefficiency and truth is thus established. \u2026 The production of proof ... thus falls under control of \nanother language game, in which the goal is no longer truth, but performativity - that is the best \npossible input \/ output equation\u201d (1984: 45\/46). The implication is that performativity favors \nknowledge which has a clear exchange value in order to pay for the expensive technologies of \nscientific research. But performativity cannot be readily applied to tourism. Here, research does \nnot require expensive laboratories or the construction of costly prototypes. So whereas scientific \nresearch can readily fall under the influence of tobacco companies, the defense industry or \npowerful pharmaceutical interests, tourism research is not so dependent upon its industry for \nfinancial assistance. Its relative cheapness offers some respite from the power of performativity. \nAnother aspect of purpose relates to the funding of university research. In the UK \npublicly funded research is dependent on the regular Research Assessment Exercise (RAE). Here \nTribe (2003) has alluded to the \u201cRAE-ification\u201d of tourism research. One important aspect of this \nis that tourism research is forced into \u201cunits of assessment\u201d supplied by the RAE. For RAE 2008 \nthese include Business and Management Studies, Geography and Environmental Studies and \nAnthropology (but not tourism). The point here is that the structure supplied by the RAE exerts \npower on the type of tourism research carried out militating against a free-ranging \nmultidisciplinary tourism studies approach in favor of business and management studies, \ngeography etc. The RAE thereby performs a selector role in generating tourism research that fits \nwith its own structuring of knowledge. \n 12 \n \nIdeology. This section examines two aspects of ideology (Althuser 1969; 1984). Ideology can \nrefer to the common sense set of beliefs (often implicit) permeating society which guides thought \nand action. However the term is also used to describe specific, coherent subsets of beliefs \n(generally \u201c\u2013isms\u201d, or faith systems). Taking the first meaning, Apple (1990:5) explains how \nideology \"saturates our very consciousness\" so that it becomes the taken for granted way of \nthinking and doing. Marx viewed ideology as important first because it frames thinking in a \nparticular way and therefore distorts understanding and acts as a barrier to truth telling and \nsecond because the dominant ideology is that of the dominant class. This idea was expressed by \nGramsci (1971) as hegemony which describes the empowerment of the cultural beliefs, values, \nand practices of a dominant group and the suppression and partial exclusion of those of others. A \nkey question is whether tourism research falls under the hegemonic influences of the ideology of \nWestern capitalism and consumerism. Picard appears to support this view noting that \u201c. . . \nresearch [becomes] subject to the imperatives of policy, in the sense that one expects the \nresearcher to assume as his own an objective of social control that will allow the tourist product \nto be more finely tuned to the demands of the international market\u201d (1996:103). But ideologies \nare permeable and just as Marx managed to slip the traces of his ideological harness and write \nthe most damning and enduring critique of capitalism (Marx and Engels 1985), so a number of \ntourism researchers (including Picard) have made similar successful bids for intellectual \nfreedom. \nTurning to ideology\u2019s meaning as coherent belief systems, these range from political \nsystems such as communism, through idea systems such as pantheism, utilitarianism, liberalism \nand Confucianism to religious faiths such as Judaeo-Christianity, Mohammedism and Hinduism. \nThis raises two important issues. First, individual researchers need to consider the extent to \nwhich they operate within particular ideologies. Here it is instructive to examine liberalism. For \nmany, its commitment to truth seeking, its skepticism and its pursuit of the good and just life \nappear to elevate it beyond ideology. Accordingly liberalism is often proffered as a seal of \napproval for disinterested knowledge. However a closer inspection reveals liberal values to \ncoincide with particular interests (intellectual, metropolitan, Judaeo-Christian, Western, middle \nand upper class). Second, the tourism community as a whole needs to question whether its canon \nof knowledge (circle 3) reflects a full range of ideological positions.  For example are there many \nexamples of research generated from Islamic or Hindu standpoints? Finally, Desmond argues \nthat \u201ctourism is not just an aggregate of commercial activities; it is also an ideological framing of \nhistory, nature and tradition; a framing that has the power to reshape culture and nature to its \nown needs\u201d (1999: xiv). In other words he suggests that tourism itself is an ideology.  \nBarnett raises concerns about universities as sites of knowledge production noting that \n\u201cideologies have entered the university from several directions, within and beyond the university. \nIdeology has gained such a grip in universities that it is no longer clear that the idea of the \nuniversity \u2013 as pointing to a site of reason \u2013 can be realised\u201d (2003:1-2). Barnett argues that \nuniversities are undermined not only by external ideologies such as entrepreneurialism, \ncompetition, quality and managerialism, but also that their own activities such as teaching and \nlearning are becoming ideologies. \nGiven the power of ideology, critical theory has the important job to expose its presence \nin research. \"The job of critical theory is initially to identify which particular ideological \ninfluences are at work. Ideology critique then asks whose interests are being served by a \nparticular ideology\" (Tribe 2001:446). However, Botterill et al\u2019s survey of doctoral theses \nsuggests that little tourism research foregrounds ideology. Their survey found \u201cfew abstracts that \nindicated the influences of critical theory\u201d (2003:293). This point is supported by perusal of the \n 13 \nCABABS database where the term \u201cCRITICAL THEORY\u201d only occurs in summary details of 4 \nof the 12,175 articles abstracted between 1990 and 2002.  \n \nCONCLUSION \nTourism research carries with it a subtle power to define: to skew: to objectify: to \nforeground some issues leaving others untouched: to legitimize some methods casting others to \nthe periphery: to privilege some groups whilst excluding others and to tell stories in \nparticularistic ways. This is not to say that lies are being told about tourism, nor is it sought to \ndenigrate positivist or applied research: Both make significant contributions to the developing \ncanon of knowledge. Rather it is concluded that tourism research has the generative power to \nconstruct and to frame tourism. \nFigure 1 illustrates the double selectivity that operates in the construction of tourism \nknowledge. Selectivity operates initially when the researcher casts a gaze into the world of \ntourism (K\u0002J, Figure 1). Which parts are illuminated by the beam of that gaze are pre-\ndetermined by the actions of the knowledge force-field on the researcher. Not all parts have an \nequal chance of attracting the researcher\u2019s gaze. A second selectivity occurs when research is \ncarried out. The processing of research (J\u0002Circle 3, Figure 1) also comes under the influence of \nthe knowledge force-field. The story that is told will be inevitably skewed by person of the \nresearcher and their situatedness. Circle 3 in Figure 1 can therefore never offer what Rorty \n(1979) refers to as an accurate \u201cmirror to the natural\u201d (circle 1) and knowledge cannot provide a \nfaithful representation of reality. Rorty notes that: \n\u2026no description of how things are from a God's-eye point of view, \nno skyhook provided by some contemporary or yet-to-be-\ndeveloped science, is going to free us from the contingency of \nhaving been acculturated as we were. Our acculturation is what \nmakes certain options live, or momentous, or forced, while leaving \nothers dead, or trivial, or optional (Rorty 1991:13 ). \nRorty\u2019s analysis thus underscores how the factors highlighted in the knowledge force-field act \n(often unconsciously) to legitimate and suppress knowledge about tourism. The force-field \ndemonstrates how the canon of tourism knowledge is heavily contingent on the power of those \nwho speak for tourism, their spatial and temporal situatedness and the social practices that \nsustain their position and authority. \nSo while individual researchers attempt to tell the truth about tourism, collectively they do \nnot tell the whole truth or indeed nothing but the truth. This is inevitable despite their individual \nefforts to achieve validity and reliability or transparency and plausibility. The canon of tourism \nknowledge is therefore partial, illustrated in figure 1 by a bunching of tourism knowledge \ncreation into the segment ABC of circle 3. A large segment AZB is uncharted and is subject to \nonly sporadic research forays. Returning to a question posed at the beginning of this article, \ncircle 3 does not, on this reading, provide a comprehensive or congruent representation of \ntourism (circle 1). Not all aspects of the phenomenon have an equal chance of establishing \nthemselves in the canon of knowledge. Permission to narrate may be denied to peripheral groups \nand there are many gaps and silences in research.  \nHowever the discussion demonstrates that a simple Marxist critique of tourism research is \nclearly inaccurate. The knowledge force-field offers a more nuanced and subtle critique. Nor is \ntourism research in the grip of a restrictive paradigm. It is hardly affected by performativity. \nEven disciplinary strictures are yielding, possibly as Smith notes, towards post-disciplinarity \nwhich \u201crequires even more flexible and creative approaches to investigating and defining objects \nthan inter-disciplinary approaches by further stripping away the inhibitions associated with \n 14 \ndisciplinary parochialism\u201d (1998:311). Indeed, there is good reason to agree with Tribe that \u201cthe \ntotality of tourism studies has now developed beyond the narrow boundaries of an applied \nbusiness field and has the characteristics of a fledgling post-modern field of research\u201d (2005:1). \n Signs include the emergence of more reflexivity and evidence of research which complements \ntourism as a business practice and which encourages innovative and radical lines of enquiry. This \nmay point to the establishment of \u201cnew tourism research\u201d (Tribe 2005:1), a turn that is showing \nsigns of organization and dissemination through journals, texts and conferences. Tourism \nknowledge is pushing out from the segment ABC in figure 1.  This confirms the findings of \nGoodson and Phillimore who in their post-1996 review of journals found that \u201c The horizons of \ntourism research are widening\u201d (2004:41). \nTo encourage the pushing of the boundaries of knowledge in circle 3 perhaps (as noted \nby Urry 1990) tourism researchers should ensure that their explorations include journeys into \nproximate mental territories as well as forays deep into distant lands. It seems that the lure of \nexotic settings often beckons more strongly than that of the library and that the other is \ninspected more readily than the self. Indeed Edward Said\u2019s popular, tightly-packed epigram \nprovides the most fitting last words for this article. Tourism researchers must be prepared to \n\u201cspeak truth to power\u201d (Said 1994:xvi). But perhaps at the same time they should seek to speak \ntruth of power and facilitate the speech of the powerless. \u25a0 \n 15 \nREFERENCES \nAitchison, C.  \n1996 Patriarchal Paradigms and the Politics of Pedagogy: A Framework for a Feminist Analysis \nof Leisure and Tourism Studies.
