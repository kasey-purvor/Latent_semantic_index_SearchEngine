Introduction \n \nIce streams play an important role as regulators in the behaviour of modern ice sheets \n(e.g. Antarctica, Bamber et al., 2000) and take the form of corridors of fast flowing \nice bounded by ice flowing up to an order of magnitude slower (Stokes and Clark, \n2001; Bennett, 2003). A number of ice streams have also been recognised draining the \nmargins of the former Late Devensian British and Irish Ice Sheet (Fig. 1a): e.g. \neastern Scottish Highlands (Merritt et al., 1995; Golledge and Stoker, 2006); \nnorthwest Scotland and the Minch (Bradwell et al., 2007); western Shetland \n(Davidson and Stoker, 2007); northern England (Everest et al., 2005; Evans et al., \n2009); south and northeast Wales (Jansson and Glasser, 2005); northern and central \n 2\nIreland (Knight et al., 1999); and Irish Sea (\u00d3 Cofaigh and Evans, 2001; Scourse and \nFurze, 2001; Evans and \u00d3 Cofaigh, 2003; Roberts et al., 2007). The \ngeomorphological signature of palaeo ice streams, in particular, has received \nsignificant attention (Dyke and Morris, 1988; Hodgson, 1994; Patterson, 1997, 1998; \nClark and Stokes, 2001, 2003) allowing the establishment of a set of criteria for \nidentifying the existence\/former existence of ice streams (Stokes and Clark, 1999). \nWork on the sedimentary and structural legacy of ice streams (Clark and Stokes, \n2003), although limited, is also increasing. For example, work by Evans and \u00d3 \nCofaigh (2003) in southern Ireland, Harris et al., (1997) and Thomas and Chiverrell \n(2007) in northwest Wales, Williams et al., (2001) in Cumbria, and Thomas et al., \n(2004) and Roberts et al., (2007) on the Isle of Man, has shown that the sediments at \nthe margin of the Late Devensian Irish Sea Ice Stream were pervasively deformed as \nit retreated from its maximum extent in the Celtic Sea (Scourse and Furze, 2001). The \npolyphase deformation histories recorded by these often complex sedimentary \nsuccessions have been equated with repeated phases of readvance during retreat of a \nhighly dynamic ice sheet margin (Thomas and Chiverrell, 2007). Recently, swath \nbathymetry data has revealed that subglacial and ice-marginal landform systems \nassociated with the Irish Sea Ice Stream are locally well-preserved offshore of \nAnglesey, providing evidence for the grounding of the ice sheet during deglaciation \n(van Landeghem et al., 2008, 2009). \nThe potential role played by subglacial geology on processes occurring \nbeneath ice streams has been recognised in Antarctica. Anandakrishnan et al. (1998) \nconcluded that the positioning of ice streams in Western Antarctica is dependant upon \nsubglacial geology. The primary objective of this paper is to highlight the role played \nby bedrock geology on landform distribution beneath a much older ice stream, the \nLate Devensian Irish Sea Ice Stream. The spatial relationships displayed between \nsubglacial landforms and bedrock geology are described from two sites located close \nto the eastern margin of this ice stream, Anglesey in northwest Wales and the Rhins of \nGalloway in southwest Scotland (Fig. 1b). A link between landform morphology and \ndistribution and the disposition of the main tectonostratigraphical units within the \nbedrock has been established. The locally abrupt changes in the morphology of the \nlandforms developed beneath the Irish Sea Ice Stream have locally been found to have \nbeen controlled by large-scale faults and\/or major lithological boundaries. The control \nexerted by less durable bedrock lithologies on location and lateral extent of relatively \nfaster flowing portions of the ice stream are also demonstrated. \n \n2. Study areas and techniques  \n \nThe two study areas, Anglesey (northwest Wales) and the Rhins of Galloway \n(southwest Scotland), were selected due to: (1) their close proximity to the eastern \nmargin of the Irish Sea Ice Stream (Fig. 1b); (2) they possess a well-preserved suite of \nsubglacial landforms (Thomas and Chiverrell, 2007; Salt and Evans, 2004, \nrespectively); (3) the landforms show very little evidence of being modified during \nthe subsequent retreat of the ice sheet; (4) both areas are relatively low-lying so that \nthe influence on of topography on landform distribution would have been reduced \nallowing the control exerted by the underlying bedrock to be more clearly assessed; \n(5) the structure and stratigraphy of the bedrock geology in these areas are well-\nknown; (6) the structural grain of the bedrock in both areas includes elements that are \nparallel and orthogonal to the former ice flow direction; and (7) the bedrock geology \n 3\nis highly variable, ranging from relatively soft sandstone dominated sedimentary \nsequences, through to more resistant metamorphic rocks, including, in the case of \nAnglesey, high-grade gneisses and granitic rocks (see sections 3.2 and 4.2). Although \nrelatively small areas, when compared to the extent of the Irish Sea Ice Stream (see \nFig. 1), the variation in bedrock lithology present in both study sites is comparable to \nthat underlying the majority of the northern Irish Sea (see BGS, 1991, 1994; Jackson \net al., 1995). Recent geomorphological mapping of a number of areas offshore of \nAnglesey (Van Landeghem et al., 2008, 2009) has demonstrated that a comparable \nsuite of glacigenic landforms occur beneath the Irish Sea to those present within both \nstudy areas. Consequently, Anglesey and the Rhins of Galloway represent ideal \nterrestrial sites in which to investigate the control of bedrock geology on landform \ndevelopment beneath the Irish Sea Ice Stream. \nThe key characteristics (orientation, width, length and elongation ratio) of the \nglacigenic individual landforms present in the two study areas, which includes \nclassical egg-shaped drumlins, were captured and analysed using Arc Map GIS \nDesktop software package. Using two differently illuminated hill-shaded NEXTMap \n(\u00a9 NERC) digital elevation models (see Figs. 6a and 11a) to avoid azimuth bias, the \nlong (length) and short (width) axes of each of the landforms were digitised manually \nand stored as two separate line datasets. Once digitised, the length and width of the \nlandforms were automatically calculated. The mean, maximum and minimum \nelongation ratio, length and width of the landforms are listed in Tables 1 and 2, the \ndata displayed graphically on Figs. 2, 3 and 4. Both line data sets (which include the \nnumerical length and width data) were then combined, with the orientation of the \nindividual landforms being represented by a single line (corresponding to its long \naxis; see Figs. 6b and 11b) and attributed with the length and width data for that \nparticular feature. These data were then used to calculate the elongation ratio (long \naxis (length)\/short axis (width)) of the landforms using the Field Calculator. The \ncentral point of each landform (i.e. the central point of the long axis), attributed with \nthe elongation ratio value, was then exported to a point dataset allowing the \nsubsequent interpolation of the data into a colour graduated raster format showing the \nvariation in landform elongation ratio across the study area (see Figs. 6b and 11b).  \nA map of the landforms (see Figs. 5a and 10a) and the 1:50,000 digital \nbedrock geology map (DIGMap) for both Anglesey (see Fig. 8) and the Rhins of \nGalloway was draped over the NEXTMap hill-shaded digital terrane models for these \nareas. This allowed a detailed comparison to be made between the distribution and \nmorphology of the landforms and the underlying bedrock geology; in particular, the \neffect of major changes in bedrock lithology and the presence of large-scale tectonic \nstructures, on the geometry and elongation ratio of the glacigenic landforms. The \npotential influence of pervasive bedrock structures, such as bedding, cleavage and\/or \nfold axes, on the morphology and orientation of the landforms was also investigated \nby plotting bedrock structural and landform orientation data on lower hemisphere \nstereographic projections and rose diagrams (see Figs. 9 and 13). \n \n3. Example 1: Anglesey, NW Wales \n \n3.1. Regional glaciological setting \n \n 4\nIt has long been recognised that ice, initially sourced in central and southwest \nScotland, flowed south through the southern Irish Sea Basin during the Late \nDevensian glaciation (Fig. 1) (Tiddeman, 1872; Jehu, 1909; Mitchell, 1960, 1972; \nSynge, 1964; Bowen, 1973a, b), merging with the Irish Ice Cap to the west and the \nsmaller Welsh Ice Cap to the east, to form the Irish Sea Ice Stream (Merritt and \nAuton, 2000; Evans and \u00d3 Cofaigh, 2003; Hiemstra et al., 2006; Roberts et al., 2007). \nSince Tiddeman (1872), most workers have agreed that the advance and retreat of the \nIrish Sea ice was terrestrial. However, Eyles and McCabe (1989) argued that during \nthe Late Devensian ice expanded down the Irish Sea basin when the floor was \nisostatically depressed, followed by a marine re-flooding event during deglaciation. \nThese authors believed that this resulted in a rise in relative sea-levels up to 100 m \nOD, interpreting most of the outcropping glacigenic sequences below this height as \nglaciomarine in origin. Subsequent work around the Irish Sea basin (Harris, 1991; \nMcCarroll, 1991, 1995, 2001, 2005; Scourse, 1991a, b; Austin and McCarroll, 1992; \nMcCarroll and Harris, 1992; Harris et al., 1997; Thomas et al., 2004; Merritt and \nAuton, 2000; Hambrey et al., 2001; \u00d3 Cofaigh and Evans, 2001; Scourse and Furze, \n2001; Evans and \u00d3 Cofaigh, 2003; Glasser et al., 2004; Etienne et al., 2006; Thomas \nand Chiverrell, 2007; Roberts et al., 2007) has rejected this model and the consensus \nview is that the deposits associated with the Irish Sea Ice Stream, including those on \nAnglesey, are principally terrestrial in origin. \nAnglesey occurs at the eastern margin of the Irish Sea Ice Stream (Fig. 1b), \nwhere ice moving southwest met, coalesced with and ultimately decoupled from ice \nemanating from the Welsh Ice Sheet centred on Snowdonia (McCarroll, 2005; \nThomas and Chiverrell, 2007). The glacigenic sequence and landforms on Anglesey \nare, therefore, key to our understanding of bed conditions beneath the Irish Sea Ice \nStream during the Late Devensian. \n \n3.2. Bedrock geology \n \nAlthough a relatively small, topographically low-lying island (c. 735 km2), Anglesey \ndisplays a very complex bedrock geology. The pre-Quaternary geology of the island \ncan be divided into five main units (Fig. 5b): (i) a pre-Ordovician basement \nassemblage referred to as the Mona Complex (Greenly, 1919; Gibbons, 1983, 1989; \nHowells, 2007); (ii) an Ordovician overstep sequence consisting of coarse to fine-\ngrained sandstones, conglomerates and mass flow deposits (Bates, 1972, 1974; \nBeckly, 1987), occupying a Y-shaped tract in central Anglesey; (iii) a volumetrically \nrestricted Silurian succession of deep marine mudstones and volcanic rocks exposed \nin a small (c. 6 km x 1 km), elongate belt centred on Parys Mountain in northern \nAnglesey; (iv) an unconformable ?Silurian to Devonian fluviatile red-bed succession \ncomprising tabular to trough cross-bedded conglomerates, cross-laminated to planar \nlaminated sandstones and locally calcrete-rich siltstones (Greenly, 1919; Allen, 1965; \nDavies, 2005); and (v) Carboniferous sedimentary succession which can be divided \ninto an older (Dinantian) shallow marine\/lagoonal carbonate sequence comprising \nbioclastic limestones intercalated with subsidiary terrestrial terrigenous sandstones \n(Walkden and Davies, 1983; Davies, 1984, 1991; Davies et al., 2004), and a younger \n(Pennsylvanian), poorly exposed coal-bearing succession of fluviatile to deltaic \nsandstones and conglomerates (Greenly 1919); the crop of the latter being restricted to \nthe low-lying area beneath Malltraeth Marsh (Fig. 5b). The Siluro-Devonian sequence \nis exposed in a narrow band on the northwest-side of the Carboniferous succession, \n 5\nwhere it thins rapidly inland from its maximum width at Traeth Dulas on the northeast \ncoast (Fig. 3b). \nThe Mona Complex has been subdivided into three terranes (Gibbons, 1989) \nthat are separated by low-angle to subvertical, northeast\u2013southwest-trending brittle \nfaults and ductile shear zones. The most prominent of these is the Berw Fault (Fig. \n5b) which forms the most westerly strand of the Menai Straits Fault System and is \nmarked by a relatively steep scarp slope. These terranes are thought to represent the \ndisrupted remains of a pre-existing volcanic island arc\u2013subduction complex that were \naccreted along the northern margin of the Avalonian continent, which was located on \nthe southern side of the Iapetus Ocean, prior to the deposition of the Ordovician \noverstep sequence. The first terrane, the Monian Supergroup (Shackleton, 1975), \ncrops out extensively across Anglesey (Fig. 3b) and comprises a thick sequence of \npolydeformed low-grade (greenschist to sub-greenschist facies) metasedimentary \nrocks (Greenly, 1919; Gibbons, 1983; Phillips, 1991a, b). At the base of this \nCambrian (Tietzsch-Tyler and Phillips, 1989; Collins and Buchan, 2004) succession is \nthe Holy Island Group, a sequence (c. 1000 m thick) of distal to proximal turbiditic \nmetasandstones interbedded with metamudstone and orthoquartzite; the latter includes \nthe Holyhead Quartzite (Phillips, 1991a; Howells, 2007). This is overlain by the \nschistose metamudstones and metasandstones of the New Harbour Group (c. 2000-\n3000 m thick) (Maltman, 1977; Phillips, 1991a, b). The overlying Gwna Group \n(youngest), is represented by a thick (c. 3000 m) regional-scale olistostromic m\u00e9lange \n(Shackleton, 1969, 1975).  \nThe second terrane, the Coedana Complex of central Anglesey (Gibbons, \n1989), is a relatively narrow, northeast\u2013southwest-trending belt of poorly exposed \nNeoproterozoic (Strachan et al., 2007) metasedimentary and metamafic gneisses \nintruded by the Coedana Granite (Fig. 3b). The southeastern margin of this terrane is \nformed by a 1.5 to 2 km wide belt of gently to moderately southeast-dipping schistose \nrocks referred to as the Central Anglesey Shear Zone (Howells, 2007). The final \nterrane, the \u2018blueschist terrane\u2019 of southeast Anglesey (Gibbons, 1989; Howells, \n2007), is dominated by highly schistose Neoproterozoic metasedimentary rocks that \ncontain disrupted lenses of blueschist facies metabasalts, the famous Anglesey or \nMonian blueschists (Greenly, 1919; Kawai et al., 2006). Bedding and deformation \nstructures (folds, cleavages) present within the Monian Supergroup, as well as the \nschistosity within the \u2018blueschist terrane\u2019, are typically oriented northeast\u2013southwest, \nparallel to the major terrane-bounding faults. In northern Anglesey, however, \nstructures within the Monian Supergroup have been rotated into an east\u2013west-\norientation by the northerly dipping Carmel Head Thrust (Fig. 3b). This southeast-\ndirected brittle thrust also deforms the overlying Lower Palaeozoic cover sequence \n(Greenly, 1919; Bates, 1974; Barber and Max, 1979). \n \n3.3. Landform distribution \n \nThomas and Chiverrell (2007) divided the glacigenic sequence on Anglesey into three \nsediment-landform assemblage zones: \n \n\u2022 Zone 1 \u2013 an extensive subglacial depositional assemblage, dominated by an \nextensive drumlin field (Greenly, 1919), covering northern and western \nAnglesey. The composition of the drumlins varies from being mainly \n 6\ncomposed of Irish Sea Till, through to bedrock dominated features encased in \na relatively thin carapace of this till; \n\u2022 Zone 2 \u2013 a subglacial erosional assemblage of northeast\u2013southwest-trending \nice-moulded bedrock ridges forming an elongate tract across the central part of \nthe island; \n\u2022 Zone 3 \u2013 an undifferentiated subglacial erosional and depositional assemblage \nof elongate bedrock ridges, solitary drumlinoid landforms, bedrock channels \nand proglacial outwash and subglacial (esker) deposits, that covers the \nremainder of the island. This zone includes the proglacial outwash deposits \nwhich occur around Lleiniog (Helm and Roberts, 1984; Hart, 1985) and \nsubglacial esker sediments near Llangefni (Thomas and Chiverrell, 2003). \n \nAnalysis of the drumlins and related geomorphological features, using the techniques \noutlined in section 2, has clearly demonstrated that there are marked differences in the \nsize, elongation ratio (Fig. 2 and Table 1) and orientation (Figs. 5a and 6) of the \nlandforms present in each of the assemblage zones. Consequently, the distribution and \nextent of the landform assemblage zones on Anglesey, as defined by Thomas and \nChiverrell (2007), has been confirmed, with only minor modification to the position \nof the boundaries of the zones (Figs. 5a and 6). \n \n3.4. Relationships between landforms and underlying bedrock geology \n \nComparison of the NEXTMap digital elevation model (Fig. 6) and landform \ndistribution map (Fig. 5a) with the geological map of Anglesey (Fig. 5b) reveals that \nthe distribution of the sediment-landform assemblage zones corresponds closely with \nvariation in the underlying bedrock. The size, density and distribution of drumlins and \nother ice sculpted landforms can be seen to change dramatically across major \nlithostratigraphical boundaries and prominent terrane-bounding faults (Figs. 5a and \n6).  \n \n3.4.1. Assemblage Zone 1 \nAssemblage zone 1 of western Anglesey closely matches the area of outcrop of the \nMonian Supergroup and the unconformably overlying Ordovician overstep sequence \nwith the landforms being dominated by large equant to smaller moderately elongate \ndrumlinoid landforms (Figs. 2, 5 and 6). The mean, minimum and maximum values of \nlength, width and elongation ratio for landforms developed within assemblage zone 1 \nare listed in Table 1, with the variation in their elongation ratio shown graphically in \nFigs. 2 a, 2b and 3a. In detail this assemblage zone can be divided into a number of \nsubzones which reflect lithological changes and\/or structures within the bedrock. In \nnorthern Anglesey, a large arcuate bedrock ridge (subzone 1a on Fig. 7a), devoid of \ndrumlins, marks the line of the east\u2013west-trending Carmel Head Thrust (see Figs. 5a \nand 6a), suggesting that this pre-existing tectonic structure influence landform \ndevelopment within the bed of the ice stream. To the southwest of the thrust, in the \narea around Llyn Alaw (subzone 1b on Fig. 7a), the drumlins reappear and become \nprogressively more elongate in form (Fig. 3a) and exhibit a gentle change in long axis \norientation (Fig. 6b) which swings towards the southeast towards Holy Island. \nAdjacent to the thrust-related bedrock high, an area of more equant (elongation ratios \nof 1.3 to 1.7; also see Fig. 2a) and slightly larger (Figs. 5a and 6a) landforms \ncorresponds to the Ordovician sequence, as well as the northern part of the Skerries \n 7\nFormation of the New Harbour Group (Phillips, 1991a; Howells, 2007) and Gwna \nGroup outcrop (Fig. 8). The strike of bedding and cleavage within the Ordovician \nsandstones is approximately east\u2013west (Greenly, 1919; Bates, 1974), defining a \nroughly curving arc which parallels the Carmel Head Thrust. Ice movement direction, \ndefined by the long axis of the landforms, is highly oblique to orthogonal to the strike \nof these bedrock structures (Figs. 6 and 8). To the south, the long axes of the \nlandforms, and therefore the ice flow direction, occur at a more acute angle to the \nregional strike of the tectonic fabric (S1) and plunge of the small-scale (F2) folds \nwithin the New Harbour Group (Fig. 9). \nTo the north of the Carmel Head Thrust the drumlins are primarily developed \nupon the New Harbour Group (subzone 1c on Fig. 7a; also see Figs. 6 and 8) and \nbecome progressively more equant in form towards the bedrock high in the hanging \nwall of the thrust (Fig. 3a). In this area the ice flow direction defined by the landforms \noccurs oblique to the regional east\u2013west \u2018structural grain\u2019 within the underlying \nbedrock. The northern coastal strip of Anglesey is apparently devoid of landforms \n(see Figs. 6a and 8) and glacial sediments, with the New Harbour and Gwna Groups \nbeing exposed at the surface. To the north of LLanrhyddlad [SH 333 890] an elongate, \nroughly north\u2013south-trending area of smaller, more subdued drumlins (subzone 1d on \nFig. 7a; also see Figs. 6 and 8) clearly cuts across the bedrock ridge formed by the \nCarmel Head Thrust. This sub-assemblage of smaller, more elongate (elongation \nratios of 2.5 to 3.9) landforms has been apparently superimposed upon the larger \nearlier formed features (Fig. 7a) suggesting that the influence of thrust-related \nbedrock ridge decreased as glaciation progressed, with this high becoming \u2018breached\u2019. \nThe site of this \u2018breach\u2019 may have also been bedrock controlled as it coincides with \nthe point at which the quartzose sandstones of the Holy Island Group are cut out \nagainst the Carmel Head Thrust (Fig. 8). To the west\/northwest subzone 1d is \napparently \u2018curtailed\u2019 by a structurally more complex area of folding and faulting \nwithin the Ordovician, and thrust imbrication within the Mona Complex resulting \nfrom deformation associated with the Carmel Head Thrust. \nOn Holy Island there is only a very thin, localised, cover of glacial deposits, \nand constructional landforms are replaced by typically small-scale ice sculpted \nbedrock features. However, several features are worthy of note. First is the presence \nof a broad, sloping ice sculpted feature in the vicinity of the village of Rhoscolyn [SH \n268 757] at the southern end of the island (RA on Fig. 6). The morphology of this \nfeature mimics the shape of the underlying Rhoscolyn Anticline; a major gently-\ninclined, northeast-plunging anticlinal fold which deforms the well-bedded \nmetasandstones of the Holy Island Group. At the northern end of Holy Island the \npattern of ice sculpted bedrock features clearly reflects changes in the underlying \nbedrock, in particular picking out the more resistant Holyhead Quartzite and the \nprominent northwest\u2013southeast-trending faults which dissect and offset the boundary \nbetween the Holy Island and New Harbour groups in this area. Other high relief \nbedrock features are formed by the relatively more resistant mineralised Silurian \nvolcanic rocks exposed at Parys Mountain [SH 443 905] (PM on Fig. 6) and the large \nquartzite olistoliths (QZ on Fig. 6) present within a small area of Gwna Group \nexposed on Mynydd Bodafon [SH 469 850], to the E of Llandyfrydog. \nTo the northeast of Llyn Traffwll [SH 325 769] and Trefor [SH 375 800] there \nis an area of distinctive cross-cutting, approximately northeast\u2013southwest and north\u2013\nsouth-trending linear features clearly aligned in a rectilinear pattern on the NEXTMap \nimage (Fig. 7b). The geographical area covered by this rectilinear pattern corresponds \nremarkably well with the basal conglomerate and sandstone-rich formation of the \n 8\nOrdovician overstep sequence (the Treiorwerth Formation of Bates, 1972). Initial \nstructural data obtained for the Ordovician sequence exposed around Llyn Traffwll \n(Phillips, 1989) indicate that the pattern in the NEXTMap imagery reflects the \nintersection of moderately to steeply inclined cleavage (60\/234, 60\/063, 79\/234, \n81\/236, 75\/221, 60\/241) and more gently dipping bedding (36\/360, 42\/338, 35\/359, \n22\/018) within the bedrock (Fig. 9d). An area of relatively few landforms occurs in \nthe area to the west of Llanerchymedd [SH 418 841] (Figs. 3a and 6). Bates (1974) \nshowed that the Ordovician succession in this area is structurally complex (see fig. 1 \nof Bates, 1974) with faulting juxtaposing this folded and cleaved sandstone-\ndominated sequence against the gneissose metamorphic rocks of the Coedana \nComplex. The northwestern and eastern margins of this area coincide with major \nfaults within the Ordovician bedrock. \n \n3.4.2. Assemblage Zone 2 \nAssemblage zone 2 of central Anglesey closely matches the area of outcrop of the \nCoedana Complex, Siluro-Devonian and Carboniferous sedimentary successions \n(Figs. 5 and 6). The more variable bedrock geology is reflected in a more complex \nassemblage of, in general, larger landforms (Table 1) which range from ice-moulded \nbedrock ridges to highly streamlined or attenuated landforms (Figs. 5 and 6) that \nrecord a slightly convergent northeast\u2013southwest-pattern of ice flow (Fig. 6b) that \nfollows the regional strike of the underlying Precambrian, Lower Palaeozoic and \nCarboniferous strata (compare Fig. 6b with 5b). The greater complexity of the \nlandforms which characterise assemblage zone 2 is reflected in the more variable \npattern of elongation ratio frequency seen on Figs. 2c and d (also see Table 1). The \npattern of ice flow within the zone appears to have concentrated into the area now \noccupied by the alluvial deposits of Malltraeth Marsh (Figs. 5 and 6). The northeast\u2013\nsouthwest-trending eastern boundary to assemblage zone 2 is sharp and corresponds \nto the subvertical Berw Fault (Fig. 6). A number of smaller scale, strike-parallel faults \nwithin the bedrock are picked out by locally deeply incised subglacial meltwater \nchannels in the area between Pentre Berw [SH 523 784] and Treath Coch [SH 535 \n799] (Fig. 6b), indicating that these bedrock structures partially controlled the pattern \nof subglacial drainage. Glacial erosion along the line of the Berw Fault has \nemphasised the fault-scarp present along the southeast-side of the Carboniferous \nsuccession; this fault possibly forming the southeast flank of a half-graben into which \nthe coal-bearing Pennsylvanian strata where deposited. These relatively soft strata are \ndeeply incised to form a northeast-southwest-trending trough which extends offshore \nwhere it deepens towards the southwest. To the north and northwest of this trough, the \nattenuated landforms, including the streamlined bedrock features developed upon the \nmore durable Carboniferous limestone-bearing succession (compare Figs. 5 and 6), \nindicate an apparent funnelling\/concentration of ice flow into this trough. The \nprismatic to rhombic pattern of linear features developed in the area underlain by the \nCarboniferous limestones reflects the intersection of the subvertical principal joint set \n(north\u2013south-orientation) and gently southerly dipping bedding (approximately north-\nnortheast\u2013south-southwest-orientation) (Fig. 7c). \nIn contrast to the southeast-boundary of assemblage zone 2, its western margin \nis less well defined (see Figs. 5 and 6). In southern central Anglesey this boundary \ncorresponds to the southeastern margin of the Coedana Granite. However, to the \nnortheast, assemblage zone 2 widens and its western margin cuts across the regional \ntrend of the underlying bedrock to intersect the coast at Dulas Bay [SH 480 880] \n(Figs. 5 and 6). Interestingly, although this boundary does not correspond to a major \n 9\ngeological boundary in this area, it does mimic the arcuate shape of the outcrop \npattern of the Siluro-Devonian redbed succession and Carboniferous limestone \ndominated strata (exposed some 2 to 3 km to the east\/southeast; compare Figs. 5 and \n6), and in part corresponds to one of the major rock channels identified by Thomas \nand Chiverrell (2007). Inland of Traeth Dulas the outcrop of the redbed succession is \nmarked by an area of over deepening to form a prominent, approximately northeast\u2013\nsouthwest-trending channel (cf. Thomas and Chiverrell, 2007), with the geological \nboundary between the Siluro-Devonian and Carboniferous strata being marked by a \ndistinct ice moulded break of slope (Fig. 6). Near the coast, however, the redbeds \nform the core to a more resistant bedrock high; the elongate northeast\u2013southwest-\ntrending hill at Capel Elen [SH 485 876]. This elongate ice sculpted feature \ncorresponds to the steeply-inclined to overturned south-facing limb of a large scale \nfold (the Lligwy Bay Syncline). \n \n3.4.3. Assemblage Zone 3 \nAssemblage zone 3 in eastern Anglesey corresponds to the area of outcrop of the \nblueschist terrane, the Gwna Group and Carboniferous sedimentary strata, and occurs \nbetween the Berw Fault and Menai Straits (Figs. 5 and 6). The more subdued pattern \nof elongate bedrock ridges and solitary drumlinoid landforms which dominate the \nzone are largely underlain by the blueschist terrane. The size and elongation ratio of \nthe landforms which characterise zone 3 (see Fig 2 and Table 1) increase \nprogressively from north to south, along the strike of this assemblage zone (Fig. 3b). \nThe orientation of the landforms is parallel to the regional schistosity developed \nwithin these metamorphic rocks. In the northeastern part of the assemblage zone, the \nstrike of the underlying bedrock is at a high-angle to the main ice movement direction \n(see Figs. 5b and 6b). The roughly triangular outcrop pattern of the Ordovician strata \nin the area to the northwest of Beaumaris [SH 605 760] is marked by an over \ndeepened area bounded to the north and southwest by higher ground of exposed \nbedrock occupied by the more resistant Carboniferous and Gwna Group strata (see \nFigs. 5 and 6). In this area, there is a marked decrease in the elongation ratio of the \nlandforms founded upon Gwna Group and Ordovician strata (Fig. 3b).  \nA distinctive ice scoured bedrock high on the south-side of Treath Coch \n(Pentraeth Forest [SH 545 790]; Fig. 6) corresponds to an area of bedrock intruded by \na relatively high density of northwest\u2013southeast-trending mafic dykes. Contact \nmetamorphism associated with the emplacement of these intrusive igneous rocks \nwould have resulted in the recrystallisation of the adjacent country rocks and, hence, \ntheir becoming more resistant than the surrounding strata. In the southwestern part of \nassemblage zone 3, the marked lithological contrasts between the Carboniferous \nstrata, Gwna Group and blueschist terrane are less apparent in the size and distribution \nof the landforms; for example between the Carboniferous limestone-dominated \nsequence and rocks of the blueschist terrane exposed in the area around Brynsiencyn \n[SH 483 671], to the northeast of Newborough Warren [SH 340 640] (see Figs. 5 and \n6). \n \n4. Example 2: Rhins of Galloway, SW Scotland \n \n4.1. Regional glaciological setting \n \n 10\nThe Rhins of Galloway and adjacent area of southwest Scotland occur close to the \nonset zone of the Irish Sea Ice Stream (Fig. 1). The Rhins of Galloway form an \nelongate peninsula that extends south-southwest into the Irish Sea. During the Late \nDevensian the peninsula was overridden by the main Scottish Ice Sheet as it fed ice \nmoving southward down into the Irish Sea (Late Glacial Maximum). During \nsubsequent deglaciation the area was traversed by a succession of ice streams, until \nthe final disappearance of the ice sheet toward the end of the Late Glacial Period \n(Charlesworth, 1926; Kerr, 1982; McCabe et al., 1998; Salt and Evans, 2004; \nBradwell et al., 2008). Glacial landforms on the Rhins of Galloway and the adjacent \narea of mainland Scotland are dominated by northeast\u2013southwest-trending drumlins \nwhich, along with other streamlined features (Figs. 10 and 11), record ice flow from \nthe northeast (Charlesworth, 1926; Salt and Evans, 2004). This southwest-directed \nadvance accompanied the deposition of a widespread, upper, red to light brown non-\ncalcareous till (Geikie and Geikie, 1869; Kerr, 1982). An older, compact, north-\nderived calcareous till occurs locally and is separated from the upper till by a sand \nbed; the latter rarely preserving evidence (sand-filled ice cast wedges) for an \nintervening period of periglacial activity (Kerr, 1982). The southwest-directed \nadvance was followed by a period of ice stagnation and retreat. This was in turn \nfollowed by an ice advance towards the south-southeast, passing through Loch Ryan \nand into the upper part of Luce Bay (Salt, 2001; Salt and Evans, 2004; Peacock and \nEverest, in press). Charlesworth (1926) identified a belt of \u2018kame moraines\u2019 to the \nsouth of Stranraer which he referred to as the Stranraer Moraine, arguing that they \nresulted from a readvance from the north. Kames, eskers and buried-ice topography \noften indicate ice decay during active retreat, or may be formed following a surge \nrather than during normal advance by active ice (Sutherland, 1993; Peacock and \nEverest, in press), therefore the idea of a northerly readvance has not been entirely \nrejected (see Salt and Evans, 2004). \n \n4.2. Bedrock geology \n \nThe bedrock geology of the Southern Uplands is dominated by a series of elongate \nnortheast\u2013southwest-trending fault-bounded tracts of Lower Palaeozoic turbiditic \nsandstones with interbedded siltstones and mudstones, and rare conglomerates (Stone, \n1995; Lintern and Floyd, 2000; Floyd, 2000; Smith et al., 2000). These weakly \nmetamorphosed sedimentary rocks were originally deposited adjacent to the northern \nmargin of the Iapetus Ocean, which separated the continents of Laurentia, to the N, \nand Gondwana to the south. This major ocean basin finally closed during the late \nSilurian to early Devonian, resulting in the tilting, southeast-directed thrusting and \nlocalised folding of these oceanic sediments (McKerrow et al., 1977; Leggett et al., \n1979; Stone et al., 1987). During closure of the ocean the thrusts were progressively \nback-rotated to form the steeply inclined tract-bounding faults. These faults are \nlocally marked by thin slivers of the condensed, graptolite-bearing deep marine \nmudstones of the Moffat Shale Group (see Floyd, 2000 and references therein). The \nLower Palaeozoic sedimentary rocks are locally unconformably overlain by a younger \nCarboniferous to Permian sedimentary succession, deposited in a series of elongate, \nnorth\u2013south to north-northwest\u2013south-southeast-trending fault controlled basins. \nThe geology of the Rhins of Galloway is shown in Fig. 10b. In this area the \nLower Palaeozoic rocks are divided into two by the Cairngarroch-Orlock Bridge \nFault; a major tract-bounding structure that separates the older, Ordovician (Arenig to \n 11\nAshgill) Leadhills Supergroup, to the north, from the younger, Silurian in age, Gala \n(Llandovery) and Hawick (Late Llandovery to Wenlock) groups to the south. Bedding \nand cleavage within these rocks are, in general, steeply inclined to vertical with a \nrelatively consistent northeast\u2013southwest-strike, the so called Caledonian trend. The \nLeadhills Supergroup is subdivided into the locally conglomeratic Corsewall \nFormation at its base, overlain by a thick, relatively monotonous sequence of well-\nbedded wacke sandstones belonging to the Kirkcolm, Galdenoch, Portpatrick, \nGlenwhargen and Shinnel (youngest) formations (Stone, 1995; Floyd, 2000; Smith et \nal., 2000). The thinner bedded, relatively calcareous sandstones of the Hawick Group \ncrop out on the southern end of the Rhins of Galloway where they are intruded by the \ndioritic to granitic Portencorkrie complex (Fig. 10b). \nOn the western side of Loch Ryan the Leadhills Supergroup is unconformably \noverlain by a very thin (30 m thick) Carboniferous sequence (Fig. 10) of sandstones \nand interbedded mudstones and seatclays (Leswalt Formation, Stone, 1995). These \nare in turn unconformably overlain by Permian red sandstones and conglomerates \n(Loch Ryan Formation, Stone, 1995) that fill a narrow, elongate, northwest\u2013southeast-\ntrending basin which occupied the area between Loch Ryan and Luce Bay, and was \nbound to the northwest by the Loch Ryan Fault (Fig. 10). \n \n4.3. Landform distribution \n \nThe general pattern of palaeo ice-stream flow identified by Salt and Evans (2004) is \ngenerally confirmed by NEXTMap imagery, however, additional analysis here of the \nlandscape morphology has led to a further development of the interpretation and \nhighlighted the control on former ice flow directions exerted by the bedrock geology. \nApart from the meltwater deposits described by Charlesworth (1926), the landforms \nof the Rhins of Galloway area can be divided into three landform assemblage zones \n(Figs. 10 and 11) in which the features are constructional, composed of till and\/or \nother glacial deposits: \n \n\u2022 Zone 1 \u2013  occurs on the Rhins of Galloway and is characterised by generally \nNE\u2013SW-trending drumlins;  \n\u2022 Zone 2 \u2013 occurs between Loch Ryan and the western side of Luce Bay and \ncomprises low, grooved and moulded, south-southeast-trending streamlined \nlandforms, up to 2.5 km in length, together with low elongate drumlins (e.g. at \nKnockarod [NW 980 650]). The northwestern part of this zone locally \ntransgresses across drumlinoid\/mounded landforms more typical of \nassemblage zone 1;  \n\u2022 Zone 3 \u2013 is located to the east of Loch Ryan and Luce Bay, and is dominated \nby low streamlined forms and drumlins. \n \nAnalysis of the geomorphological features clearly demonstrates that there are marked \ndifferences in the size, elongation ratio (Fig. 4 and Table 2) and orientation (Figs. 10a \nand 11) of the landforms present in each of the assemblage zones. There is little \nevidence for continuous belts of kame moraines recorded by Charlesworth, except for \na prominent north-northeast\u2013south-southwest-trending ridge at High Boreland [NX \n087 585]. The occurrence of streamlining south of the ridge (e.g. at Knockarod) \nindicates that much of this ground is underlain either by till or glacially deformed \nsediment rather than by meltwater deposits. The so-called lateral moraines mapped by \n 12\nCharlesworth (1926) to the west of Stranraer are reinterpreted as streamlined \nlandforms. \n \n4.4. Relationships between landforms and underlying bedrock geology \n \nComparison of the NEXTMap digital elevation model with the geological map of the \nRhins of Galloway and adjacent area of southwest Scotland reveals that the \ndistribution of the sediment-landform assemblage zones clearly reflects the \nunderlying bedrock (Fig. 10). The size, density and distribution of drumlins and other \nice-sculpted landforms can be seen to change dramatically across major \nlithostratigraphical boundaries and prominent tract-bounding faults (Figs. 10 and 11). \n \n4.4.1. Assemblage Zones 1 and 3 \nAssemblage zones 1 and 3 are underlain by the Lower Palaeozoic bedrock (Fig. 10). \nThe landforms developed within these zones are relatively similar in size and shape \n(Fig. 4 and Table 2) and are dominated by generally north-northeast\u2013south-southwest-\ntrending drumlins and low streamlined bed forms (Figs. 11 and 12a). In areas of \nexposed bedrock in zones 1 and 3, the regional trend of bedding and, to a lesser \nextent, cleavage within the underlying sandstones is picked out by a closely spaced set \nof northeast\u2013southwest-trending low-amplitude ridges (e.g. in the area to the northeast \nof Little Cairnbrock [NH 978 667]; Fig. 10). The palaeo ice flow direction defined by \nthe long axes of the drumlins and other streamlined features in zone 1 is typically \noblique to the \u2018structural grain\u2019 of the bedrock, occurring at an angle of 30\u00b0 to 45\u00b0 to \nthe strike of bedding (Fig. 11 and 12b). This indicates that, on a broader scale, ice \nflow cut across the regional trend of the underlying fault-bound Lower Palaeozoic \ntracts. \nIn the northeast of assemblage zone 3, an area of relatively smooth terrain \nlacking in constructional landforms (Fig. 11) may reflect the former presence of very \nslow moving ice. This area is centred upon the Kirkcolm Formation (Floyd, 2000; \nSmith et al., 2000) of the Leadhills Supergroup (see Figs. 10 and 11) and is bound to \nthe north by the Glen App Fault and to the south by the main northerly outcrop of the \nGaldenoch Formation. To the southwest within assemblage zone 1, however, the \nalong strike lateral equivalent bedrock tract is cross-cut by a set of well-developed \nnorth-northeast\u2013south-southwest-trending drumlins. The Glen App Fault forms part of \nthe Southern Upland Fault system which represents a major terrane boundary within \nthe bedrock, separating the Southern Uplands from the Midland Valley terrane \nimmediately to the north. This major fault acted as a focus for glacial erosion and is \nmarked by a prominent northeast\u2013southwest-trending valley (Fig. 11). Similarly, an \nunnamed NNE\u2013SSW-trending fault, which partially controls the valley of the Water \nof Luce, has also been exploited by subglacial erosion. \nOverall the orientation of the constructional glacigenic landforms in zones 1 \nand 3 records ice flowing from north-northeast to south-southwest straight across \nsouthwest Scotland (Fig. 11b); typical of the earliest phase of ice advance recorded in \nthe area (Kerr, 1982). However, in detail the pattern of ice flow is more complex, \nreflecting major changes in bedrock geology. In the area on the northeastern side of \nLuce Bay, to the southeast of Dunragit [NX 152 575], the landforms of zone 3 define \na broad curve equated with southerly rotation in ice flow direction from the upland \narea to the northeast, into the bay (Fig. 11b). Landforms in this area become more \nelongate in form as they rotate into a more north-south-orientation. These changes in \n 13\nice movement direction and landform morphology broadly correspond to a major \nchange in bedrock geology from the weakly metamorphosed Lower Palaeozoic \nsandstones in the northeast, to the much softer Permian sandstones occupying the area \nbetween Loch Ryan and Luce Bay (see Figs. 10 and 11). The boundary between the \nLower Palaeozoic rocks and the younger Permian strata is formed by the Loch Ryan \nFault. \nFlow lines constructed using the orientation of drumlin and streamlined \nlandform long axes show that the pattern of ice movement in both zones 1 and 3 can \nbe divided into a number of \u2018domains\u2019. These domains are characterised by localised \narcuate to sigmoidal patterns of ice movement (see Fig 12a) recording a deflection of \nice movement from a north-northeast\u2013south-southwest-trend to a more northeast\u2013\nsouthwest-orientation parallel to the Caledonian trend of the underlying bedrock (see \nFigs. 10 and 11). This is most clearly observed within zone 3 in the area around \nGlenluce [NX 200 576] where the change in orientation of the landforms is spatially \nrelated to the tract-bounding Fardingmullach and Glen Fumart faults which form the \nboundaries between the Portpatrick and Shinnel formations, as Shinnel Formation and \nGala Group, respectively (Figs. 11 and 12a). Similar changes in landform orientation \nare also evident on the Rhins of Galloway within assemblage zone 1 where they occur \nabove the Glen App, Morroch Bay, Drumbreddan and the closely spaced Glaik and \nKillantringan faults (Fig. 11). The area to the south of the Drumbreddan Fault on the \nRhins of Galloway is relatively lacking in glacigenic landforms. This area \ncorresponds to the Hawick Group which is intruded by the Portencorkrie Complex. \n \n4.4.2. Assemblage Zone 2 \nAssemblage zone 2 largely corresponds to the area of outcrop of the Permian \nsandstones and is characterised by highly elongate streamlined landforms (see Figs. \n10 and 11); although the southern part of the zone is largely obscured by later \ndeposits. The northeast margin of the zone is sharp and corresponds to the line of the \nLoch Ryan Fault. Glacial erosion of this fault line resulted in the formation of a \nmarked topographic feature. The southwestern margin of zone 2 is apparently more \ngradational in nature. In the area to the south and west of Stranraer the southwest limit \nof zone 2 corresponds to the unconformity separating the Permian sandstones from \nthe underlying Lower Palaeozoic rocks (Fig. 10a). In the northwest, between \nKirkcolm [NX 030 686] and Milleur Point [NX 020 737] the streamlined landforms \nof zone 2 are superimposed upon a set of earlier northeast\u2013southwest-trending \ndrumlins and are underlain by the Ordovician Corsewall and Kirkcolm formations \n(see Figs. 10 and 11). \n \n5. Bedrock controls on landform distribution, subglacial processes \nand ice flow patterns beneath the Irish Sea Ice Stream \n \nIt is clear from the previous descriptions of the two study areas that the there is a close \nrelationship between the size, distribution and orientation of glacial landforms and the \nstructure and composition of the underlying bedrock. This relationship suggests that \nbedrock geology can, in some cases, influence the processes occurring near the base \nof major ice sheets. Patterns of ice-flow have been constructed for both Anglesey and \nthe Rhins of Galloway using the orientation of drumlin and streamlined landforms, \nand are shown in Figs. 6b and 11b. The results of this study can be used to \ndemonstrate that several key bedrock features including bedrock highs, \u2018structural \n 14\ngrain\u2019, the presence of large-scale faults, and changes in bedrock durability or \nhardness can influence processes occurring beneath and patterns of ice flow within ice \nsheets. The control exerted by these bedrock features on landform distribution and \npattern of ice flow beneath the Irish Sea Ice Stream are described below. \n \n5.1. Bedrock highs \n \nOn Anglesey, the relatively narrow (1.5 to 2 km wide) bedrock ridge formed above \nthe east\u2013west-trending Carmel Head Thrust had a significant effect on landform \ndistribution within assemblage zone 1 (Figs. 5a, 6 and 7a). This prominent bedrock \nfeature (subzone 1a on Fig. 7a) is devoid of drumlins, possesses a relatively gently \nnortherly dipping up-ice side and steeper down ice expression, and would have \npresented a focus for subglacial erosion, rather than deposition and associated \nconstructional landform development. Previously published studies have equated \nbedrock highs with \u2018sticky spots\u2019 within the beds of both ancient and modern glaciers \nand ice sheets (Licciardi et al., 1998; Kleman and Hattestrand, 1999; Stokes et al., \n2007), impeding their forward motion. The ridge-like high formed above the Carmel \nHead Thrust is likely to have led to a localised deceleration of the Irish Sea Ice Stream \nas it overrode this \u2018sticky spot\u2019. The observed systematic changes in the elongation \nratio and geometry of the drumlins formed on either side of this bedrock high (Fig. \n3a) are interpreted as reflecting this relative slowing down of the ice sheet as it \nencountered this feature. The change from equant landforms adjacent to the bedrock \nhigh (both to the north and south of this feature), to more elongate landforms as the \nice flowed southwest across western Anglesey (Fig. 3a), is interpreted as reflecting \nthe initial, relative, deceleration of the ice stream, followed by subsequent \nacceleration as the Irish Sea Ice Stream overrode this topographic feature. A similar \nprogressive increase in the elongation ratio of the landforms can be observed in \nsoutheast Anglesey (Fig. 3b; assemblage zone 3), where the ice was likely to have \nbeen accelerating as it crossed the blueschist terrane (Figs. 5 and 6). Small-scale \nfluctuations in the elongation ratio of the landforms in both assemblage zones 1 and 3 \n(Figs. 3a and 3b, respectively) are thought to indicate the presence of sticky spots \nwithin the bed of the accelerating ice sheet. The poorly exposed nature of the bedrock \nand glacial sediments in these areas, however, means that the exact nature of the \ncontrol (either bedrock or till) on the location of these sticky spots is uncertain. \nThe variation in the geometry of landforms developed on Anglesey indicate \nthat changes in elongation ratio of subglacial landforms can, with care, be used as a \nproxy for relative changes in velocity of the overriding ice (cf. Stokes and Clark, \n2002). The east\u2013west-trending bedrock high in northwestern Anglesey is clearly \ntransverse to the direction of ice flow within the Irish Sea Ice Stream and would have \nrepresented a major obstacle within its bed. Maps showing variation in elongation \nratio and flow direction (Fig. 6b) can be used to demonstrate that not only did the ice \nsheet initially decelerate and then subsequently accelerate as it overrode this \ntopographic feature, but was also forced to bifurcate, with part of the flow being \ndiverted around the northeastern end of this high (see Fig. 6b). As noted above, the \nbedrock high was a focus for subglacial erosion and was eventually \u2018breached\u2019 (Figs. \n7a and 8), recording the initial stages of its removal. Consequently, any control \nexerted by bedrock features on ice sheet dynamics may potentially, with time, \ndiminish due to either their removal by either subglacial erosion and\/or burial beneath \na thick pile of subglacial sediments. The combined effect of subglacial erosion and \n 15\ndeposition is to smooth out any perturbations in the bed of the ice sheet. However, in \nparts of Anglesey and the Rhins of Galloway the superficial cover is relatively thin or \npatchily developed, potentially enabling a bedrock control on subglacial processes \nduring the entire existence of the Irish Sea Stream. \n \n5.2. Bedrock \u2018structural grain\u2019 and bedrock \u2018stickiness\u2019 \n \nIn both study areas the lower ratio landforms, and by inference the slower moving ice, \noccur where the ice stream was flowing over the polydeformed and metamorphosed \nmetasedimentary rocks (Anglesey, assemblage zone 1 - Monian Supergroup and \noverlying Ordovician strata; Rhins of Galloway, assemblage zones 1 and 3 - \nOrdovician and Silurian strata, Figs. 3, 6 and 11). Along the north coast of Anglesey \nand on the bedrock high formed above the Carmel Head Thrust, bedding and\/or \nschistosity within the exposed bedrock is marked a clear pattern of small-scale, east\u2013\nwest-trending ridges (see Fig. 8). Similar features occur on the Rhins of Galloway \nwhere a set of parallel, low-amplitude, closely spaced ridges reflect the well-bedded \nnature of the underlying Lower Palaeozoic metasandstones (Fig. 12b). In the absence \nof a thick subglacial sedimentary sequence in these areas, the laterally extensive \nridge-like features would have represented a persistent irregularity within the glacier \nbed, effectively increasing its \u2018roughness\u2019 and therefore \u2018stickiness\u2019. Consequently, in \nareas of thin or patchily developed subglacial sediment cover the structural grain of \nthe bedrock can influence the relative velocity of the overriding ice. \nEvidence from both Anglesey and the Rhins of Galloway, however, suggests \nthat the degree of angular discordance between the strike of a pervasive bedrock \nstructure (e.g. bedding, schistosity, cleavage) and the principal ice flow direction may \naffect its relative \u201cstickiness\u201d and that of any bedrock highs (the greater the angle = \nthe greater the roughness of the bed = the \u2018stickier\u2019 the high). In northern Anglesey \n(assemblage zone 1) the strike of both bedding and schistosity present within the \nMonian Supergroup are orthogonal to the principal ice flow direction. To the \nsouthwest, more elongate landforms occur where ice flow was oblique (c. 30\u00b0 to 40\u00b0) \nto the strike of the foliation within the New Harbour Group (Figs. 9a to c). A similar \noblique relationship between ice flow direction and the \u2018structural grain\u2019 of the \nbedrock also occurs within assemblage zones 1 and 3 of the Rhins of Galloway (Fig. \n13). In this situation the potential for small-scale bedrock ridges to impede ice flow \nwould be reduced; essentially the smaller the angle between ice flow direction and the \n\u2018structural grain\u2019 of the bedrock, the lower its effect on bed roughness. This is \nsupported by the relationships present within assemblage zones 2 and 3 on Anglesey \nthe regional strike of the steeply inclined schistosity and main ice flow direction are \ncoincident, as a result the bedrock features are streamlined and less of a hindrance to \nthe smooth passage of the overriding ice. \nThe angle of dip of these bedrock structures may influence the \ngeomorphological characteristics of any high formed within the bed of the ice sheet. \nFor example, sub-horizontal bedding may lead to step-sided bedrock highs, whereas \nin areas of subvertical bedding where the regional strike and ice flow direction are \ncoincident would preferentially lead to the formation of steep-sided elongate ice-\nsculpted features. One important point to be made here is that where ice flow \ndirection and structural trend of the bedrock are coincident, care must be taken when \nattempting to use highly elongate ice-sculpted bedrock features as the sole proxy for \nestablishing the relative speed of the overriding ice. In areas where sub-vertically \n 16\ndipping beds or layers of resistant rock, such as basalt, occur within a softer host \nlithology and are aligned parallel to the ice movement direction, these harder units \nmay preferentially lead to the formation of highly elongate landforms irrespective of \nthe relative velocity of the overriding ice. \n \n5.3. Localised deflection of ice flow in response to large-scale faults \n \nOn the Rhins of Galloway, Salt and Evans (2004) interpreted localised changes in the \nlandform orientation within their Glenluce and Rhins districts as recording a complex \nset of separate, superimposed phases of ice advance (also see fig. 3 of Evans et al., \n2009). However, the small-scale changes in landform orientation (assemblage zones 1 \nand 3, this study) are systematic and can be directly related to the presence of the \nnortheast\u2013southwest-trending, tract-bounding faults within the bedrock, in particular \nthe Fardingmullach, Glen Fumart, Glen App, Morroch Bay, Drumbreddan and closely \nspaced Glaik and Killantringan faults (Figs. 11 and 12a). The result was the \nsegmentation of the pattern of ice movement between the faults into a series of \narcuate or sigmoidal flow trajectories (Fig. 12a) during a single southwest-directed \nphase of ice advance. The recognition that prominent bedrock structures can locally \naffect the pattern of ice movement has led to a simplification of at least part of the \nglacial history of the Rhins of Galloway. The dextral pattern of off-set present in the \nice flow trajectories (see Fig. 12a) occurred as ice advancing from the northeast was \ndeflected in the vicinity of the steeply inclined faults which strike at a moderate to \nhigh angle to the principal direction of ice flow. In general, the faults are not marked \nby any obvious topographic surface expression, suggesting that their influence was \nmore likely to have been on subglacial processes. The faults are marked by highly \ndeformed lenses of mudstone (Moffat Shales) and locally wide zones of brittle \ndeformation leading to an increase in the porosity\/permeability within the bedrock. It \nis likely that such localised changes in bedrock permeability would have also \ninfluenced the hydrodynamic system set up within the bed of the overlying ice sheet, \nwhich in turn may have affected ice movement. \n \n5.4. Bedrock durability or hardness \n \nThe durability or hardness of the bedrock on both Anglesey and the Rhins of \nGalloway played a role in controlling the relative velocity or sitting of faster flowing \nzones the overriding ice stream. On Anglesey the coal-bearing Carboniferous and \nsandstone dominated Siluro-Devonian strata, which underlie the highly elongate \nlandforms of assemblage zone 2 (see Figs. 5a and 6), were deeply incised by \nsubglacial erosion to form a northeast\u2013southwest-trending trough, informally referred \nto as the Malltraeth trough (Fig. 5), which deepens towards the southwest. To the \nnorth and northwest of this trough, the change in orientation of landforms, which \ninclude the streamlined bedrock features developed upon the more durable \nCarboniferous limestone-bearing succession (Figs. 6 and 7c), records the funnelling \nand relative acceleration of the overriding ice as it was drawn down into the \nMalltraeth trough. The relationship between this over deepened trough and the \nunderlying bedrock geology is shown in Fig. 14. The progressive erosion of the softer \nsedimentary rocks within the Malltraeth trough would have facilitated the build up of \na relatively thick, but localised, subglacial sequence beneath this part of the ice sheet. \n 17\nOver time, this would have resulted in a localised change in the dominant mechanism \nresponsible for forward motion of the ice sheet, possibly from one dominated by basal \nsliding and\/or ice deformation associated with a very thin sediment bed or ice-bedrock \ncontact, to one in which movement was dominated by deformation of a thicker soft \nbed. Fault-guided subglacial meltwater channels in the area between Pentre Berw [SH \n470 725] and Treath Coch [SH 530 800] (Figs. 6 and 14) would have helped feed \npressurised water into the Malltraeth trough, facilitating bed deformation, and leading \nto increased forward motion of the ice sheet. The combination of potentially high \npore-water contents\/pressures and the sand-rich nature of the sediment derived from \nthe sandstone-rich bedrock sequences, would\/could have aided dilation of the \ndeforming bed during the introduction of subglacial meltwater, thereby reducing basal \nfriction and leading to a relative speeding up of the overriding ice. \nThe southeast-margin of the Malltraeth trough is confined by the steeply \ninclined Berw Fault and the much harder, subvertical, schistose rocks of the \n\u2018blueschist terrane\u2019 (Fig. 14). Consequently, expansion in the area of drawdown \nfeeding this zone of accelerating ice flow, at least initially, appears to have been \nlargely accommodated by ice resting on the more gently inclined rocks of the Gwna \nGroup and Central Anglesey Shear Zone located to the northwest (Fig. 14). The \n\u2018structural grain\u2019 of these metamorphosed basement rocks is coincident with the \nprincipal ice flow direction and, therefore, would not have necessarily impeded the \npropagation of the zone of faster flowing ice across these rocks. As the area of \ndrawdown expanded towards the northeast it would have encountered the limestone-\ndominated Carboniferous succession (Figs. 6 and 14); a relatively free-draining \nsequence that is essentially devoid of a glacigenic cover. Although the ice-sculpted \nlandforms developed upon the Carboniferous limestones have a high elongation ratio, \nthese rocks may have represented a \u2018sticky spot\u2019 within the floor of the zone of \nrelatively faster flowing ice, forcing a further widening of the area of drawn down and \nobserved expansion of assemblage zone 2 in this area (see Fig. 6). \nA similar model involving the relative acceleration of the ice sheet as it \noverrode softer bedrock is supported by the close spatial relationship between \nassemblage zone 2 and the Permian sandstone on the Rhins of Galloway. The margins \nof the zone are controlled to the northeast by the Loch Ryan Fault and to the \nsouthwest, by the basal Carboniferous\/Permian unconformity (see Figs. 10 and 11). \nLandforms on the southwestern side of the zone exhibit a rapid decrease in elongation \nratio towards the higher ground formed by the Lower Palaeozoic rocks (Figs. 11 and \n12b); indicative of a potential frictional drag effect caused by either a rise in \ntopography and\/or change in bedrock lithology. A link between frictional drag on the \noverriding ice and bedrock geology is supported by the decrease in the elongation \nratio of the landforms at the northwestern end of zone 2 where the bedrock is \ncomposed of the Corsewall and Kirkcolm formations (Fig. 10). Immediately to the \nsoutheast, the elongation ratio of the landforms rapidly increases as the ice passes \nonto the softer Carboniferous and overlying Permian strata (Fig. 12b). Closely spaced, \nresistant beds of Palaeozoic metasandstone form a series of low amplitude ridges, \ntransverse to the southeast-directed ice movement direction responsible for the \nstreamlined landforms of zone 2. As noted above, such ridges would increase the \n\u2018roughness\u2019\/\u2018stickiness\u2019 of the bed, leading to the deceleration of the overriding ice \nsheet.  \nThe influence of the Loch Ryan Fault, which forms the northeast margin of the \npostulated zone of \u2018faster flowing\u2019 ice, seems to vary along its length from north to \nsouth. In the north, the steeply inclined fault denotes a sharp boundary between \n 18\nassemblage zones 2 and 3, with the area to the east of the fault apparently being \ndevoid of any obvious landforms (Fig. 11) and representing an area over either static \nor very slow moving ice. To the south\/southwest, the strike of the Loch Ryan Fault \nchanges orientation from north-northeast\u2013south-southwest to approximately \nnorthwest\u2013southeast (Figs. 10 and 11). In this area, adjacent to the  northeastern side \nof Luce Bay, the elongation ratio of the landforms developed within the southern part \nof assemblage zone 3 increases rapidly southwards, accompanied by a swing in \norientation towards a more north\u2013south-trend (Figs. 11 and 12a). This is consistent \nwith the ice sitting over the southern part of assemblage zone 3 occurring within an \narea of draw down which fed the relatively faster flowing ice occupying the broad \ntrough-like feature represented by Loch Ryan and Luce Bay. If this interpretation is \ncorrect it would mean that the landforms in the southern part of assemblage zone 3 are \n\u2018polycyclic\u2019 and formed in response to at least two major phases of ice movement. In \ncontrast to the eastern side of Luce Bay, there is very little if any evidence for the \ndraw down of ice sitting over the Rhins of Galloway. \n \n5.5. Potential bedrock control on landform distribution beneath the Irish Sea Ice \nStream \n \nRecent work by van Landeghem et al. (2008, 2009), using swath bathymetry, has \ncommenced the mapping of the glacial and post-glacial landforms present on the bed \nof the Irish Sea. This work has revealed the presence of well-preserved subglacial and \nice-marginal landforms (including drumlins, flutes, ribbed moraines and eskers) some \n20 to 25 km offshore of northern Anglesey. Van Landeghem et al. (2008, 2009) \ninterpreted the landforms as providing evidence for the grounding of the Irish Sea Ice \nStream during deglaciation. The size and variation in the distribution of the landforms \nmapped by van Landeghem et al., (2009) are comparable to those seen on the Rhins \nof Galloway and Anglesey. Importantly, in their area 1, van Landeghem et al. (2009) \nnoted that the ribbed moraines, which are very well-developed over the majority of \nthis area of the seabed, were absent immediately above the hinge of a major NE-\ntrending anticline (the Quadrant 109 Arch of Jackson et al., 1995) developed within \nthe underlying Carboniferous bedrock (see fig. 3 of van Landeghem et al., 2009). The \nsubcrop of the Carboniferous bedrock is close to the seabed with only a thin \nQuaternary cover over the hinge of the anticline, with the trend of this major fold \noccurring parallel to the main ice flow direction. \nArea 2 of van Landeghem et al. (2009), located at the notheastern end of a \nlarge northeast\u2013southwest-trending trough within the seabed (see fig. 6 of Landeghem \net al., 2009). In this area the glacially streamlined landforms (flutes) and drumlins are \ninterpreted by Landeghem et al. (2009) as recording convergent ice-flow as ice \nflowed southeast into the central Irish Sea Basin, along the edge of an exposed rock \nplatform. The trough is founded upon Carboniferous (Namurian) bedrock which, \nonshore, comprises a sequence of mudstones and siltstones with thick sandstone units. \nThe southern margin of the trough is composed of more resistant Carboniferous \n(Dinantian) limestones which form a narrow strip along the northwestern margin of \nthe Holy Island Shelf (Jackson et al., 1995); the latter comprising a sequence of \nmetamorphosed Lower Palaeozoic and basement (Mona Complex-like) rocks. The \nconvergence of ice flowing into the offshore trough founded upon less resistant \nCarboniferous strata is comparable to the situation within assemblage zone 2 on \nAnglesey where converging ice flow is being drawn down into the Malltraeth trough. \n 19\nThe less resistant Carboniferous sandstones and mudstones in both situations facilitate \npotentially penecontemporaneous over-deepening by glacial erosion. A similar effect \nof ice being drawn down into a subglacial trough, leading to a pattern of convergent \nice flow, has also been recognised in assemblage zone 2 on the Rhins of Galloway \nwere the trough (now occupied by Luce Bay) is carved into relatively softer Permian \nstrata (see Fig. 12).  \nThe geomorphological mapping of the Irish Sea basin has only just begun (van \nLandeghem et al., 2008, 2009). However, the comparison between the results of the \npresent study on Anglesey and the Rhins of Galloway with those of van Landeghem \net al. (2009) indicate that major structures and lithological changes within the bedrock \nappear to have locally controlled subglacial landform distribution and the positioning \nof relatively faster flowing zones across the bed of the Irish Sea Ice Stream. \n \n6. Conclusions \n \nSeveral conclusions can be drawn regarding the distribution and extent of the \nlandform assemblage zones identified on Anglesey and the Rhins of Galloway \nreflecting potential bedrock controls on processes occurring beneath the eastern \nmargin of the Late Devensian Irish Sea Ice Steam:  \n \n\u2022 Changes in the geometry, density and distribution of drumlins and other ice \nsculpted landforms can be directly related to major changes in bedrock \ngeology. Sharp, well-defined boundaries between the landform assemblage \nzones on both Anglesey and the Rhins of Galloway correspond to major \nlithostratigraphical boundaries (e.g. base Permian unconformity on the Rhins \nof Galloway) and\/or prominent faults (e.g. Berw Fault on Anglesey); \n \n\u2022 As recognised by previous studies on both ancient and modern glaciers and ice \nsheets, bedrock highs within their beds represent \u2018sticky spots\u2019 impeding \nforward motion. The east\u2013west-trending, bedrock ridge developed above the \nCarmel Head Thrust on Anglesey had a significant effect on landform \ndistribution within the bed of the Irish Sea Ice Stream and presented a focus \nfor subglacial erosion, rather than deposition and associated constructional \nlandform development; \n \n\u2022 The variation in the geometry of drumlins developed on either side of a major \nbedrock high in western Anglesey indicates that changes in elongation ratio of \nthese subglacial landforms can be used as a proxy for relative changes in ice \nflow velocity. It is possible that maps showing the variation in elongation ratio \nand ice flow direction may be used to show potential changes in the ice flow \nvelocity and trajectory across the bed of an ice sheet; \n \n\u2022 The presence of pervasive bedrock structures such as bedding and\/or cleavage \ncan lead to an increase in bed roughness and, therefore, a decrease in the \nvelocity of the overriding ice. The most streamlined bedforms occur in areas \nwhere ice-flow direction coincides with the regional strike of the bedrock \nstructure. Consequently, the angle between the ice movement direction and the \n\u2018structural grain\u2019 of the bedrock represents a key factor in determining the \n 20\ndegree to which bedrock structure will influence the relative velocity of the \noverriding ice; \n \n\u2022 Evidence from the Rhins of Galloway indicates that the presence of large-\nscale faults within the bedrock may result in localised changes in the pattern of \nice movement. Such faults are often marked by wide zones of brittle \ndeformation leading to an increase in bedrock permeability, which in turn may \nhave influenced the subglacial conditions beneath the overlying ice sheet; \n \n\u2022 Bedrock lithology can play an important role in controlling the relative \nvelocity and\/or location of faster flowing zones the overriding ice stream. The \nless durable (softer) sandstone-dominated successions on both Anglesey \n(Carboniferous) and Rhins of Galloway (Permian) were deeply eroded in \nresponse to subglacial erosion, leading to the formation of elongate bedrock \ntroughs. These troughs acted as a focus for ice movement, drawing down more \nslowly moving ice into the developing zones of relatively faster flowing ice. \nThe progressive erosion of softer sedimentary rocks may facilitate the \ndeposition of a thick subglacial sequence beneath at least part of the ice sheet, \nresulting in localised changes in the dominant mechanism responsible for \nforward motion of the ice sheet. \n \n\u2022 Comparison of the results from this study, with the distribution of landforms  \nwithin the Irish Sea of offshore of northern Anglesey (van Landeghem et al. \n2008, 2009) indicate that major structures and lithological changes within the \nbedrock may potentially have controlled subglacial landform distribution and \nsiting of relatively faster flowing zones across the entire bed of the Irish Sea \nIce Stream. \n \n \n7.
