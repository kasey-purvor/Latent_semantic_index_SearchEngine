Introduction \nInstitutively, second order SDMs usually achieve lower SNR than high order \nones because high order loop filters can achieve better noise shaping characteristics. \nMoreover, the signal transfer function should be designed to have large values and the \nnoise transfer function should be designed to have small values at the passband of \nloop filters in order to achieve good noise shaping characteristics, so SNR should be \nhigh if input signal bands match passbands of loop filters and low otherwise. Based \non this argument, one may expect that SNR will be low when input signals have \nlowpass characteristics while loop filters have bandpass characteristics. \n 2\nHowever, since the above argument is based on the noise shaping theory which is \nformulated using a linear model, while quantizers in SDMs are nonlinear components, \nthe linear model may not explain nonlinear system behaviors. In this letter, a \ncounterexample is given to illustrate that a second order bandpass interpolative SDM \nmay also give a very high SNR for lowpass inputs. \n \nII. Main results \nConsider the following second order interpolative SDM: \n( ) ( )21 217 731319960.99999998804569999999753.01 75145011.23441350728819330.1118520110 \u2212\u2212\n\u2212\u2212\n+\u2212\n\u2212=\nzz\nzzzF . \nFigure 1 shows the magnitude response of the loop filter. It can be seen from the \nfigure that the loop filter has a bandpass characteristics with peak frequency located \nround \n3\n\u03c0 . We assume that the oversampling ratio of the SDM is 64 because it is the \nmost common value used in the audio industry [1]. Also, we use the delays of the \noutput of the loop filter as state variables, that is, ( ) ( ) ( )[ ]Tkykyk 12 \u2212\u2212\u2261x , in \nwhich ( )kx  and ( )ky  are the state vectors and the output of the loop filter, \nrespectively. We assume that the SDM is initially at rest, so ( ) 0x =0 . The reason for \nchoosing the delays of the output of the loop filter as state variables and assume \ninitially at rest is because zero output at the loop filter is the most common situation \nin a real case. Figure 2 shows the SNR performance of the SDM. Here, we adopt the \ndefinition of SNR defined in [2], that is, the inputs are sinusoidal signals with \nfrequency \n96\n\u03c0 , which are regarded as lowpass inputs compared to the peak frequency \nof the loop filter. It can be seen from Figure 2 that this SDM can achieve SNR as high \nas 323.5228dB for input magnitude less or equal to 02.1 , while 323.5037dB for input \nmagnitude larger than 02.1 . Compared this result to a fifth order SDM [1], it can only \n 3\nachieve an average of 111.1987dB for an input magnitude less than or equal to 0.59, \nand -41.6297dB for above. To compare the result with the second order SDM with \ntwo DC poles and a zero located at 0.5, it can only achieve an average of 65.6404dB \nfor an input magnitude less than or equal to 08.1 , and 8.5519dB for above. Hence, \nthis second order SDM produces better performance than a fifth order SDM [1] and \nthe two DC poles second order interpolative SDM. \nThe SDM can achieve such high SNR because of exhibiting the limit cycle \nbehavior. If the quantizer output is periodic with the period being an integer multiple \nof the input signal, then the input of the loop filter is periodic with the period equal to \nthat of the quantizer output. Hence, the quantizer input is also periodic with the same \nperiod as its output. In this case, the SNR of the SDM can be very high even though \nthe loop filter is second order and has the bandpass characteristics. To illustrate this \nphenomenon, the magnitude spectra of the filter output, the quantizer output and the \ninput signal are shown in Figure 3, in which the period of both the quantizer output \nand the input signal is found to be 192. \n \nFigure 1: Magnitude response of the loop filter. \n 4\n \nFigure 2: SNR of the second order interpolative SDM. \n-4 -2 0 2 4\n100\n120\n140\n160\n180\n200\n220\n240\nFrequency \u03c9\nM\nag\nni\ntu\nde\n s\npe\nct\nru\nm\n o\nf f\nilt\ner\n o\nut\npu\nt (\ndB\n)\n-4 -2 0 2 4\n0\n2000\n4000\n6000\n8000\n10000\n12000\n14000\nFrequency \u03c9\nM\nag\nni\ntu\nde\n s\npe\nct\nru\nm\n o\nf q\nua\nnt\niz\ner\n o\nut\npu\nt\n-4 -2 0 2 4\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n1.2\n1.4\n1.6\n1.8\n2 x 10\n4\nFrequency \u03c9\nM\nag\nni\ntu\nde\n s\npe\nct\nru\nm\n o\nf i\nnp\nut\n s\nig\nna\nl\n \nFigure 3: Magnitude spectra of the filter output, the quantizer output and the input \nsignal of the second order interpolative SDM. \n \nIII.
