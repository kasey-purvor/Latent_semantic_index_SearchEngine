The secondary aim was to identify additional \noutcomes that ought to be collected in future primary studies or in systematic reviews \nof the literature.   \nDesign:  Questionnaire survey of a cohort of women with SUI. \nSetting: UK. \nSample: 188 women with SUI. \nMethods: Areas of importance to women who suffer from SUI were assessed using a \npatient generated index (PGI).  In addition to the PGI, the questionnaire included the \nKing\u2019s Health Questionnaire (KHQ) and the EuroQol- 5D (EQ-5D). \nMain Outcome Measures: PGI, EQ-5D, and the King\u2019s Health Questionnaire. \nResults: In total, 38 different areas were reported by respondents on the PGI.  PGI \nand EQ-5D scores were positively correlated and significant.  Correlations between \nthe seven domains of the KHQ and PGI were all negative but only two were \nstatistically significant: personal relationships and severity measures.  \n \nConclusion:  The PGI succeeded in capturing a diverse range of outcomes of \nimportance to women suffering with SUI.  Given the limited correlation between the \n 3 \nKHQ domains and the PGI and, in addition, that the areas mentioned in the PGI were \nnot found to map well to the EQ-5D, the PGI in this instance may be capturing \nconcerns of women who suffer from SUI which are not captured by quality of life \nmeasures such as the EQ-5D.  \n \nIntroduction \nStress urinary incontinence (SUI) is the most common type of incontinence, \nespecially in middle aged-women.  It is defined as involuntary leak or loss of urine \ncaused by sneezing, exercising, lifting or physical activity (Abrams et al 2002).  \nStudies investigating the prevalence of SUI in women are hampered by differing \ndefinitions of SUI, and social factors such as the limited recourse to health care due to \nembarrassment.  Indeed, only 15% of women identified as suffering from SUI consult \na health professional (Shaw et al, 2006; 2001), suggesting that those presenting for \nhelp represent the \u2018tip of the iceberg\u2019 of a common condition.  Embarrassment \nassociated with urinary incontinence may cause withdrawal from social situations and \nreduces quality of life (Hunskaar and Vinsnes 1991).  Many women with SUI show \nsymptoms of depression and introverted behaviour, together with dysfunctional \ninterpersonal relationships (Norton et al, 1988).  Furthermore, SUI may lead to \nwithdrawal from regular physical activities and thus impair women\u2019s general health \n(Nygaard et al 1990).   \n \nThe aim of this survey was to provide evidence on outcomes of importance to women \nwho have SUI.  Much of the available literature focuses on clinical outcomes which as \na result may have limited relevance to women with SUI.   The purpose of this work \nwas to prospectively survey women with SUI to provide information on outcomes of \n 4 \nimportance to them; a secondary aim was to identify additional outcomes that ought to \nbe collected in future primary studies or define relevant outcomes for systematic \nreviews of the literature.   \n \n \nMethods \nIn order to assess the areas of importance to women who suffer from SUI, a \nquestionnaire was designed. A patient generated index (PGI) (Ruta et al, 1994) was \nemployed to allow respondents to state and evaluate the areas of their life affected by \nSUI.  In addition to the PGI, the questionnaire included the Kings Health \nQuestionnaire (KHQ) (Kelleher et al, 1997), the EQ-5D and questions relating to \nsocioeconomic and demographic information.   \n \nThe Questionnaire \nThe PGI is an individualised patient-reported health instrument which allows the \nrespondent to select, weight, and rate the importance of a particular health outcome \n(Martin et al, 2006).  The PGI was designed with the aim of producing a valid \nmeasure of outcome that reflected areas of importance to patients\u2019 lives (Ruta et al \n1994).  The PGI involves the respondent deciding what factors are important to them. \nExamples of the types of factors that may be important are included to provide \nguidance.  The aim of the PGI is therefore to capture the diverse range of concerns or \npriorities of respondents.  Using the PGI, respondents can vary the weight they attach \nto these concerns or priorities, which provide researchers with an insight into the \nrespondent\u2019s viewpoint.  An overall score for the PGI for each respondent can then be \n 5 \ncalculated by multiplying the rating for each health area by the proportion of points \nallocated to that particular area.   \n \nThe PGI is completed in three stages: in the first stage respondents are asked to \nidentify up to five areas of their life that are affected by their SUI.  Respondents are \ngiven a list of outcomes to act as prompts to help them think about which areas of \ntheir life are affected by their condition.  Respondents can then choose from these \noptions or provide their own examples.  In addition to the five boxes, there is a sixth \nbox which enables respondents to rate all other areas of their life affected by their \nSUI.  Possible examples of the factors to include on the PGI were drawn from three \nsources.  The first of these was the King\u2019s Health Questionnaire, which was used to \ngenerate a list of outcomes under the broad headings of: Role limitations; Physical \nlimitations; Social limitations; Personal relationships and Emotions.  These outcomes \nwere supplemented from Cochrane reviews of non-surgical treatments (Hay-Smith \nand Dumoulin 2006; Brazzelli et al 2007; Mariappan et al 2007; Bezerra et al 2007).  \nFinally, a general literature search was also conducted although this did not provide \nfurther additions to the 17 different outcomes identified from the KHQ and the \nCochrane reviews.  These outcomes were then narrowed down to those considered \nmost relevant by members of the project team.   \n \nIn stage two of the PGI, respondents were asked to score each area listed in stage one \nof the PGI on a scale ranging from 0 to 6.  The score given in stage two was intended \nto reflect how the individual was affected by their SUI in the past month.  A score of 0 \nwould signify that the effect on their life was as bad as it could possibly be and a \nscore of 6 would correspond to an effect that was as good as it could possibly be.   \n 6 \n \nFinally, in stage 3, respondents were asked to \u2018spend\u2019 10 points to indicate the relative \nimportance of each of the areas mentioned in stage one.  Respondents were requested \nto spend more points on areas that were the most important to them.  \n \nAs noted above, in addition to the PGI, the questionnaire also contained the Kings \nHealth Questionnaire (KHQ) and the EQ-5D.  The KHQ is a condition specific \nquestionnaire which aims to assess the impact of urinary incontinence on an \nindividual\u2019s quality of life.  It contains questions set in nine domains relating to: \ngeneral health perception, incontinence impact, role limitations, physical limitations, \nsocial limitations, personal relationships, emotions, sleep and energy, and severity.  \nWith the exception of the final part of the questionnaire (severity measures) scores \ncan be calculated for each domain (0 \u2013 100).  The higher the score the worse off an \nindividual feels they are and the lower they perceive their quality of life to be.   \nThe EQ-5D is a standardised instrument for use as a measure of health outcome. \nApplicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatments, it provides a simple \ndescriptive profile and a single index value for health status \n(http:\/\/www.euroqol.org\/.)  The EQ-5D has five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual \nactivities, pain\/discomfort and anxiety\/depression) that can be converted into a utility \nscore.   \n \nSample \nThe Bladder & Bowel Foundation (formerly InContact and the Continence \nFoundation) is a national charity that provides information and support to people with \nbladder and bowel problems, representing the interests of people with continence \n 7 \nproblems with the aim of ensuring they have access to the latest information and \nservices available (http:\/\/www.bladderandbowelfoundation.org\/). In 2006 a survey \nconducted by InContact was completed by 755 people affected by bladder and bowel \nproblems (Buckley, Wagg, Winder 2007). Of these, 188 women with SUI gave \nconsent for future contact about relevant research and formed the sample for the \ncurrent study. In July 2007 these women were sent questionnaires for the current \nstudy by InContact. Given that this is a self slecctedselected sample of women \nsuffering from SUI and not a random sample of the population, it is not known how \nrepresentative this sample is of the wider population. \nEthical issues \nThe 2006 survey in which the participants were originally identified was a service \nevaluation in which InContact surveyed people who had previously been in touch \nwith the charity and as such no ethical approval was necessary. The 2006 survey \nmaterials contained an explicit assurance that confidentiality would be maintained and \nthat identifiable data would not be passed on to third parties. Respondents were asked \nif they were willing to be contacted in the future for research purposes. For this study \nquestionnaires were sent in July 2007 to 188 women with SUI who gave their consent \nfor further contact relating to research. The questionnaires were returned directly to \nthe charity and after screening only anonymous data were subsequently forwarded to \nthe authors in accordance with the Medical Research Council\u2019s guidance on the use of \npersonal information in medical research and the Data Protection Act 1998 (HMSO, \n1998; Medical Research Council, 2000). \n \nResults \n 8 \nIn total, 105 out of 188 respondents (55.9%) completed and returned the \nquestionnaire.  Table 1 shows the areas of an individual\u2019s life that they reported to be \naffected by their SUI and the frequency that the area was mentioned within the sample \nas a whole. Thirty-eight different areas were reported by respondents. \n \nOut of 105 respondents, 73 answered the PGI correctly, 9 respondents made mistakes \nin the PGI and 23 respondents did not fully complete it (Table 2).  Of the 73 \nrespondents who correctly completed the questionnaire, 61 answered the PGI with no \nmistakes (all sections were completed satisfactorily), the remaining 12 respondents \nmade a small error in completion of the PGI.  This small error always occurred in \nsection three of the PGI, where respondents had to spent 10 points, these respondents \ndid in fact spend ten points, however they missed out spending points in area 6 (all \nother areas of their life affected by SUI) and totalled to ten in box 6. An example of \nthe PGI used can be seen in aAppendix 1. \n \nTable 3 shows the demographic information of the sample as a whole and for those \nindividuals who correctly completed and incorrectly completed the PGI.  The mean \nage for the sample as a whole was 57 (range 28 to 89).  As can be seen in Table 3, \nthose respondents who correctly completed the PGI were on average younger than \nthose who incorrectly completed the PGI.  In addition, those who correctly completed \nthe PGI appear to be better educated and in higher income groups.   \n \nIn addition to listing the outcomes of importance to women who suffer from SUI, the \nPGI can also be calculated into a score of overall quality of life.  The score ranges \nfrom 0 to 6, with 0 reflecting a very low quality of life (\u201cit\u2019s as bad as it could \n 9 \npossibly be\u201d) and 6 reflecting a very high quality of life (\u201cit\u2019s as high as it could \npossibly be\u201d)  An example of the PGI and the method used to calculate the score is \ngiven in Table 4.  For the respondents who successfully completed the PGI the mean \nscore was 2.4 (SD 1.4, range 0-6).  101 of 105 returned questionnaires had a fully \ncompleted EQ-5D.  Scores on the EQ-5D ranged from -0.17 to 1.  The mean EQ-5D \nscore was 0.598 (SD 0.339).  Correlation between the mean PGI score and the mean \nEQ-5D was, as expected, positive and significant. \n \nScores (out of 100) for each domain in the KHQ can be seen in Table 5.  The higher \nthe score, the worse off an individual feels.  In addition to the domains of the KHQ, it \nalso contains a section detailing the respondent\u2019s bladder problems and how much \nthey affect the individual\u2019s life.   \n \nCorrelations of the PGI and seven domains of the KHQ were also performed.  We \nwould expect to find a negative correlation between the PGI and KHQ.  All \ncorrelations were negative, however only two were significant: personal relationships \n(P=0.004) and severity measures (P=0.003).  \n \nIn addition, correlations of the EQ-5D score and the domains of the KHQ were also \nperformed.  We found all seven of the KHQ domains to be significantly (negatively) \ncorrelated with the EQ-5D.  This result is to be expected since many of the EQ-5D \nand KHQ domains are similar.   \n \nDiscussion \n 10 \nThe PGI has been used to quantify the effect of SUI on the quality of patients\u2019 lives \nfor the first time. The  respondents are a self-selected sample of women who had \npreviously been in touch with a patient support charity and who may be considered to \nbe active help-seekers. However, there is no reason to suspect that their experience of \nSUI and the relative perceived impact of SUI on various aspects of their lives are \ndifferent from the wider population of women affected. Nearly 70% of respondents \nsuccessfully completed the questionnaire, a further 9% attempted the PGI but made \nmistakes in its completion, and 22% failed to fully complete the PGI; the majority of \nthese respondents completed stage 1 of the PGI but failed to complete stage 2 or 3.  \nThose respondents who successfully completed the questionnaire were found to be \nyounger, in higher income groups and have a higher level of education. For the PGI to \nbe used as a valid and reliable measure of outcomes of importance to women with \nSUI and to be able to accurately quantify the effect of SUI on their lives the response \nrate and successful completion of the PGI would need to be improved.  Of the \nrespondents, 31% of respondents had difficulty in completing the questionnaire and \nthere was also a low response rate to the survey in general (55.9%).   \n \nIn order to improve this response rate and successful completion alterations could be \nmade to the layout of the PGI to make it more user-friendly.  An alternative would be \nto use the questionnaire as the basis for setting a patient\u2019s goals for treatment in a \nclinical or research setting:  achieving those goals could then be used as a measure of \npatient satisfaction.     \n   \nIn stage 1 of the PGI, 38 different areas of an individual\u2019s life affected by SUI were \nreported.  The most frequently mentioned areas were going out or socialising, with \n 11 \n14% of all respondents listing this as one of the areas of their life affected by their \ncondition.  Thirteen percent of respondents mentioned personal hygiene and 11% \nmentioned the effect their condition has on their sleep.  Shopping (8%), depression \n(8%), physical activity (6%), work (6%), anxiety (6%), travel (4%), household tasks \n(2%), personal (1%) and sexual relationships (2%) were all also listed as areas of their \nlife affected by SUI.   \n \nThe PGI, or instruments like it, have been criticised in the past, with some authors \nquestioning whether they reflect the patient\u2019s view point or, conversely, whether they \nare simply reflecting the views of the researchers who designed the questionnaire \n(Tully and Cantrill, 2000).  In this survey, whilst we did find a varied response in the \nnumber of outcomes listed by respondents, the majority of these did in fact come from \nthe prompt list provided in the PGI.  Of the 10 most mentioned areas, eight of these \nwere from the prompt list.  Other studies have found similar associations between the \nprompt list and final outcomes listed by respondents.  However, it is unclear whether \nthis association is due to the most relevant examples being selected from the prompt \nlist, or due to respondents being unwilling or unable to think of their own examples \nbecause the prompt list is already comprehensive (Russell and Macduff, 1998). \n \nWe correlated the mean PGI score and the mean EQ-5D scores.  This correlation was, \nas expected, found to be positive and significant.  In addition to this, correlations of \nthe KHQ and the PGI were performed.  Although all correlations of the PGI and KHQ \nwere of the expected sign (negative), only two were found to be statistically \nsignificant.  Given that the PGI outcomes and the domains of the KHQ do not \ncorrelate well, and that many of the aspects respondents mentioned in the PGI list of \n 12 \noutcomes do not map very well on to the dimensions of the EQ-5D this might suggest \nthat generic measures, like the EQ-5D, may not be a very good reflection of the \npreferences of people with incontinence.  The PGI in this instance may therefore be \ncapturing concerns of women who suffer from SUI which are not adequately captured \nby generic instruments such as the EQ-5D.  This is of particular interest in the context \nof health technology appraisals, where EQ-5D has become the accepted standard for \ncalculation of Quality Adjusted Life Year indices for use in determination of cost \neffectiveness (NICE 2008). \n \n \nConclusion \nMuch of the available literature on SUI focuses on doctor-selected clinical outcomes. \nGiven the undoubted social and personal impact of SUI, these outcomes may as a \nresult have limited relevance to the women who suffer this condition.  The aim of this \nsurvey was therefore to provide evidence on outcomes of importance to women who \nhave SUI.  This is the first attempt to use the PGI in this area.  In total, 48 different \nareas of an individual\u2019s life affected by SUI were mentioned, the most common of \nthese being: going out or socialising; personal hygiene; sleep disruption; the effect on \ndaily activities such as shopping; depression; physical activity; work; anxiety; travel; \nhousehold tasks; and personal and sexual relationships.  The PGI succeeded in \ncapturing a diverse range of outcomes of importance to women suffering from SUI.  \nHowever, it must be noted that some respondents did have difficulty in completing the \nPGI.    \n \n 13 \nFinally, the PGI was not found to correlate well with the domains of the KHQ, in \naddition, many of the aspects respondents mentioned in the PGI list of outcomes were \nnot found to map well on to the dimensions of the EQ-5D suggesting that generic \nmeasures, like the EQ-5D, may not be a very good reflection of the preferences of \npeople with incontinence.  We conclude that the PGI in this instance may therefore be \ncapturing concerns of women who suffer from SUI which are not adequately captured \nby generic instruments such as the EQ-5D.   \nAcknowledgements: We would like to thank the women who responded to our \nquestionnaire.
