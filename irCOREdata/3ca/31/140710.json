Screen-printed carbon electrodes modified with a variety of polymers were\nused to immobilise commercially available DNA in a single-stranded form. AC\nimpedimetric measurements were firstly carried out on these systems and then upon\nexposure to single-stranded DNA solutions. When the electrode and solution DNA\nwere complementary, a large drop in impedance was measured; this did not occur for\nnon-matching DNA exposures. DNA hybridisation sensors for closely related species\nof fish were in the first instance developed as a demonstration for this approach.\nSpecies of fish such as herrings and salmon could be differentiated by this method.\nThis sensor format offers great promise for many DNA hybridisation applications and\nlends itself to mass fabrication due to the simplicity and inexpensiveness of the\nmaterials and methods used. The hybridisation results were confirmed by use of\nellipsometry to measure the characteristics of similar films deposited on silicon\nsubstrates.\n2Introduction\nBiosensor technology has developed into an ever expanding and multidisciplinary\nfield since the Clark enzyme electrode was first reported [Clark and Lyons1962]. The\ndetermination of the human genome, the need for detection of biological pathogens\nand the development of genetically modified organisms have all led to a demand for\nsimple portable DNA detection and characterisation tools. This has led to a great deal\nof interest in electrochemical DNA hybridisation biosensors [Gooding 2002].\nDetection of and discrimination between species by studying their DNA leads directly\nfrom being able to detect and follow DNA hybridisation events. For example DNA\nfrom Mycobacterium Tuberculosis [Wang et al 1997a] can be detected using a\nsuitable biosensor at levels as low as 3.4 nmol l-1 and 0.6 nmol l-1 for human\ncytomegalovirus [Azek et al 2000]. Usually techniques like these require use of\nelectroactive labels or intermediates such as enzyme-substitution or transition metal\ncomplexes which bind to the DNA strands. It follows that a technique that can\ndirectly detect hybridisation offers many advantages in terms of simplicity in\ncomparison to those that require labels.\nFor a successful electrochemical DNA biosensor, we firstly require a recognition\nlayer, usually a single stranded DNA which will selectively hybridise with its\ncounterpart. Hybridisation, if it occurs, must lead to a measurable change in the\nproperties of the electrode layer, since during the binding of two strands of DNA, no\nnew molecules, electrons or photons are produced.\nMany workers have studied the immobilisation of DNA on electrodes surfaces\n[Gooding 2002]. A variety of methods for binding single stranded DNA to an\nelectrode are available. The strong binding of thiols to gold can be used to attach\nmodified nucleic acid strands to electrode surfaces [Levicky et al 1998], however, the\nuse of thiol-substituted DNA by itself has a tendency to give poor hybridisation\nresults due to DNA\u2019s tendency to bind flat to the gold surface. Diluting the DNA with\nsimple alkane thiols was found to release all but the modified end of the DNA from\nthe surface, leading to greater freedom of movement and better hybridisation of the\nDNA strands [Levicky et al 1998].\n3Cationic surfaces have been shown to successfully immobilise DNA by electrostatic\ninteraction. Nicolini et al (1997) showed that LB films of octadecylamine deposited\nfrom subphases containing E. coli plasmid DNA incorporated the DNA in a single-\nstranded form between the layers. Soaking these systems in solutions of single-\nstranded DNA led to further incorporation of DNA and possible formation of the\ndouble helix. Others workers have used electrodeposition onto screen-printed carbon\n(Mascini et al 2001) pre-treatment of glass slides with polyethylene imine solution\n(Lang and Liu 1999) or deposition onto amino-silanised glass (Lemesklo et al 2001)\nto immobilise DNA on electrode surfaces. Hybridisation of complementary DNA was\nshown to occur selectively, although whether actual formation of a DNA double helix\noccurs is still in doubt, and it is possible that a non-helical duplex may be the\npreferred structure (Lemesklo et al 2001). Several reviews on DNA biosensors\n(Gooding 2002, Wang et al 1997b, Pividori et al 2000) have been published, detailing\nmuch of this previous work.\nElectrically conductive polymers have been shown to be suitable substrates for the\nimmobilisation of DNA. Oligonucleotides could be grafted to polypyrrole films and\nshown by quartz crystal microbalance and photocurrent spectroscopy to hybridise\nwith their counterparts (Lasalle et al 2001). Simple incorporation of oligonucleotides\nwithin polypyrrole films has been shown by Wang\u2019s group to give sensors which\nupon hybridisation give transient current increases allowing rapid detection of the\ncounterstrand (Wang et al 1999, Jiang and Wang 2001). Hybridisation of DNA\nimmobilised in polypyrrole with its counterpart has been detected by the use of AC\nimpedance (Cai et al 2003).\nPrevious work within our group has studied the immobilisation of species such as\nenzymes and\/or antibodies within conducting polymer films or microelectrodes as\nwell as their use as biosensors (Barton et al 2004). Antibodies for example have been\nsuccessfully incorporated into polypyrrole films and this has allowed affinity based\nrecognition for their antigens to be detected by AC impedance techniques (Grant et al\n2003, 2004). We have attempted within this paper to describe our utilisation of similar\napproaches for DNA immobilisation to allow hybridisation events to be followed for\nanalytical purposes.\n4Carbon screen printed electrodes were fabricated and attempts made to immobilise\nDNA on their surfaces using either electrostatic adsorption approaches on\npolyethylenimine (Nicolini et al 1997), or immobilisation via incorporation into\nelectrodeposited polyaniline or polydiaminobenzene (Barton et al 2004). These\nelectrodes were then placed into solutions of single stranded complementary DNA\nand their AC impedance monitored with time. Control experiments were performed\nusing buffer or non-complementary DNA.\n5Experimental Section.\nHerring DNA and salmon DNA were purchased from the Sigma Chemical Company\n(Poole, Dorset, UK). Aniline hydrochloride, disodium hydrogen orthophosphate\nmonohydrate, sodium dihydrogen orthophosphate 12-hydrate, sodium chloride, and\ndiaminobenzene dihydrochloride (all \u2018AnalaR\u2019 grade), were purchased from BDH\n(Poole, Dorset, UK). All chemicals were used without further purification.\nAll water used was purified with a ELGA Purelab UHQ purifier. The pH7 buffer was\nmade by dissolving NaH2PO4H2O (0.55 g), Na2HPO412H2O (2.11 g) and NaCl (7.73\ng) in water and making up to 1 litre.\nScreen printed electrodes (Fig. 1a) were designed with carbon working and\ncounterelectrodes and a Ag\/AgCl reference electrode. The electrodes were fabricated\nusing a DEK 248 screen printer. Conductive inks (carbon type 422SS and Ag\/AgCl\ntype 6088SS) were supplied by Acheson Industries Europe (Reading) and printed\nonto Melinex plastic sheets.\nFor the polyethylene imine coated films, the working electrode was dipped into a 1%\nsolution of polyethylenimine for 5 minutes, withdrawn and allowed to dry. The\nelectrode was then placed in single stranded herring or salmon DNA solution (0.2\nmg\/ml in water denatured by boiling for 5 minutes) for 5 minutes and then rinsed. For\nthe ellipsometric measurements the substrates were silicon wafers with a native oxide\nlayer, cut to size. They were then immersed in 1% polyethylenimine solution for 5\nminutes, removed and dried, then placed in ssDNA solution for 5 minutes, rinsed and\ndried.\nFor electrodeposition of DNA containing polyaniline films, a technique based on one\npreviously reported (Barton et al 2004) was used. Aniline hydrochloride (20 mg) and\nherring DNA (6 mg) were mixed in water (30 ml) and stirred overnight to allow good\ndissolution. This solution was then heated to 95oC for 5 minutes to denature the DNA\ninto a single stranded form. The solution was rapidly cooled to room temp using\ncrushed ice. 0.17 ml of conc. HCl was added to ensure polyaniline deposited in the\nconductive form (Cooper and Hall 1992). A screen-printed electrode was then placed\n6into the solution and voltammetrically scanned for 20 cycles (-800 to +800 mV vs\nAg\/AgCl, 50 mV s-1), so as to deposit polyaniline\/DNA as shown by the cyclic\nvoltammogram.\nA similar method was used for electrodeposition of DNA containing\npolydiaminobenzene films (Barton et al 2004). O-diaminobenzene dihydrochloride\n(27 mg) and herring DNA (6 mg) were mixed in pH 7 buffer (30 ml) and stirred\novernight to allow good dissolution. This solution was then heated to 95oC for 5\nminutes to denature the DNA into a single stranded form and again rapidly cooled to\nroom temp in crushed ice. A screen-printed electrode was then placed into the\nsolution and scanned voltammetrically for 20 cycles (0 to +800 mV vs Ag\/AgCl, 50\nmV s-1), causing deposition of polydiaminobenzene\/DNA as shown by the cyclic\nvoltammogram.\nBatches of these electrodes were fabricated and interrogated via AC impedimetric\napproaches. Electrodes were immersed in fresh solutions of single stranded DNA\nsolutions (0.2 mg\/ml herring, salmon or calf thymus in pH 7 buffer) and the\nimpedance measured with time over a range of frequencies (1Hz-10kHz). Initial\ninvestigations were carried out using heated solutions (i.e. straight after boiling) but\nthe change in temperature had major effects and appeared to mask the effects of any\nhybridisation. For this reason solutions were rapidly cooled to room temperature in\nice before interrogation of the films was attempted.\nThe ellipsometric measurements were performed using M-2000VTM spectroscopic\nellipsometer, J.A.Woollam Co., Inc. The spectra and ellipsometric parameters \u03a8 and\n\u0394 in the range of 370 -1000 nm were measured using the DARCETM (diode array\nrotating compensator ellipsometry) method. Since the parameter \u03a8, related to the\namplitude ratio of p - and s - components of polarised light (\u03a8=tn(Ap\/As) ) is not very\nsensitive to the changes in thin film thickness, the spectra of the other parameter \u0394 = \n\u03c6p - \u03c6s, which is a phase shift between p - and s - components, is presented here.\nEllipsometric measurements were performed at an angle of incidence of 68o in the\nspecial cell (1) , shown schematically in Fig. 1(b). The cell containing two transparent\n7windows (2) was sealed by the silicon sample (3) through the rubber O-ring (4); the\ninjection of solutions into the cell was carried out through inlet\/outlet tubes (5).\nMeasurements were carried out on herring or salmon ssDNA coated silicon wafers.\nThe initial measurement was carried out with the cell filled with pH 7 buffer. Then a\nfreshly boiled and cooled 0.2% DNA solution was injected into the cell and left for\nthree hours. Attempts were made to measure ellipsometry during the exposure but\nconsistent results could not be obtained due to refractive index changes within the\nsolution. Therefore after three hours, the cell was flushed with fresh buffer and\nellipsometry measured. In this way consistent results could be obtained.\n8Results and Discussion\nPolyethylenimine immobilised DNA\nAC impedance measurements across a range of frequencies (1-10,000 Hz) were\nperformed on polyethylenimine immobilised single stranded herring DNA films\nimmersed in the DNA solution. Due to the many decades over which the scale of the\nplots extend, the raw data fails to show any visible changes on these scalings.\nHowever when the change in impedance is plotted with respect to time, differences\nimmediately becomes apparent. The data for each frequency was therefore processed\nby dividing the initial impedance of the polyethylene\/herring ssDNA modified\nelectrode immediately following immersion into the DNA solution, by the impedance\nmeasured at given time intervals. A typical plot of this type is shown in Fig 2(a). The\nmean change in impedance over the frequency spectrum was recorded and plotted\nagainst time in Fig 2(b).\nSince the introduction of complementary DNA was found to give rise to changes in\nimpedance which could be measured, AC impedance data of single stranded herring\nDNA polyethylenimine immobilised films upon non-complementary and\ncomplementary DNA exposure were determined for comparison. Fig. 2(b) shows\nimpedimetric changes following exposure to herring (complementary), salmon\n(non-complementary) and exposure to buffer as a control.\nIt can be seen that a large drop in impedance occurs when we have herring DNA in\nsolution, i.e. following exposure to complementary DNA, strongly indicating that the\nchange in the AC impedimetric measurements is indeed due to the hybridisation of\ncomplementary DNA strands. A similar drop in impedance upon hybridisation has\nbeen noted by other authors for DNA adsorbed on carbon nanotube modified\nelectrodes (Cai et al 2003) and is thought to be due to the higher conductivity of\ndouble stranded DNA with respect to single stranded DNA (Boon and Barton 2002).\nThe change in impedance is also seen to decrease with continued complementary\nDNA exposure as further hybridisation continues. Neither the buffer solution or the\nsolution containing salmon DNA display this behaviour.\n9It can also be seen that the changes in impedance are more pronounced at lower\nfrequencies upon exposure to complementary DNA, suggesting that the DNA\nhybridisation primarily leads to a lowering of the capacitance of the interrogated film.\nSimilar results (not shown for brevity) were obtained when salmon DNA was\nimmobilised on PEI, i.e. the electrodes showed a noticeable drop in impedance when\nexposed to complementary DNA but not upon exposure to either non-complementary\nDNA or buffer.\nPolyaniline immobilised DNA.\nThe voltammograms for the deposition of polyaniline\/DNA are depicted in Fig. 3(a).\nand imply a steady in situ formation of polymer at the electrode surface. As the\nnumber of scans increases peaks appear between +350-400 mV vs Ag\/AgCl\ncorrsponding to the oxidation and reduction of surface bound polyaniline. The\nincrease in current from scan 10 to 20 is possibly due to the increase in polyaniline\nthickness and coverage of the electrode. As before, polyaniline\/herring DNA\nelectrodes were exposed to a solution of single stranded herring DNA in phosphate\nbuffer and the impedance monitored with time; similar salmon DNA or just buffer\nsolutions were both used as controls. The results of this study are shown in Fig. 3(b).\nIn a similar manner as before it can be seen that a large drop in impedance occurs\nupon exposure to herring DNA in solution, i.e. exposure to complementary DNA,\nindicating once again that hybridisation of complementary DNA strands is occurring.\nNeither the buffer solution nor the solution containing salmon DNA display this\nbehaviour. Once again the changes in impedance are more pronounced at lower\nfrequencies upon exposure to complementary DNA (not shown for brevity),\nsuggesting a lowering of the capacitance of the interrogated film upon exposure and\ncomplementary DNA hybridisation. The overall effect also appears to be greater for\npolyaniline immobilised DNA than for PEI immobilised DNA.\nIt can be seen that for both immobilisation schemes, presence of non-complementary\nDNA causes a small upward drift in impedance. It is noteworthy that studies on\npolypyrrole immobilised nucleotides by previous workers, (Wang et al 1999), clearly\nshowed that some interaction still occurs between non-complementary DNAs but\n10\nleads to current changes in the opposing direction to those between complementary\nDNAs.\nPolydiaminobenzene Films\nSingle stranded herring DNA containing polydiaminobenzene were in a similar\nmanner formed on the surface of electrodes. Voltammograms clearly show a\ncumulative formation of an insulating layer of polymer on the electrode surface, Fig.\n4(a).\nAgain a drop in impedance is observed when exposed to herring ssDNA, Fig. 4(b). A\ndrop in impedance for salmon ssDNA may also be observed and it is possible that this\nindicates some unspecific binding to the surface, making this electrode less-selective\nthan either polyaniline or polyethylenimine modified electrodes. The drop in\nimpedance was, however, larger for the samples exposed to herring ssDNA. Again the\nchanges in impedance appeared to be mainly capacitive in nature for the\ncomplementary DNA and also for the non-complementary DNA changes in\nimpedance observed. No drop in impedance occurred for samples immersed in simple\nphosphate buffer.\nEffect of DNA Concentration with time\nElectrodes coated with polyethylenimine immobilised single-stranded herring DNA as\nbefore were used for studying the effects of DNA concentration on the observed\nimpedance with time. Electrodes were placed in varying concentrations of\ncomplementary DNA as before and the impedance monitored over periods of time\nexceeding 3 hours. Two observations can be made. As can be seen from Fig. 5,\nincreasing the concentration of DNA has a marked effect on the impedance change,\nhowever it is not a simple linear relationship. Higher concentrations lead to an initial\nhigher rate of hybridisation, probably due to a simple diffusional gradient but\ncontinue to lower the impedance throughout the time frame of this study. It would\ntherefore appear that both DNA concentration and extended time periods affect the\nobserved impedance and by inference the degree of DNA hybridisation. We can\ntherefore conclude the DNA concentration imparts diffusional control of DNA mass\ntransport to the electrode surface, but that DNA hybridisation still acts as a rate\n11\nlimiting step. The electrode response to DNA hybridisation is, in conclusion, therefore\nunder mixed mass transport and kinetic control.\nDNA Hybridisation; Electrochemical Interrogation.\nFrom our results it appears that DNA hybridisation at a surface leads to an overall\ndrop in impedance. DNA is known to complex to a positively charged polymer\nsurface and hybridisation would be expected to increase the quantity of DNA at the\nsurface. A drop in impedance could be linked to a facilitation in the electron transfer\nprocess between the electrodes and the external environment. It should not in this\ncontext be forgotten that the DNA is immobilised on the carbon surface via a\npositively charged polymer. While insulating proteins typically show an electron\ntunnelling coefficient of 1.4\u00c5-1 (Arnaut and Formosinho 1996), the conductivity of\nDNA can vary from insulating to wire-like (as recently reviewed, Boon and Barton\n2002), greatly depending on the presence of mismatches and on base-pair stacking.\nThis indicates that charge transfers of this nature may be very sensitive to the DNA\nstructure and could be facilitated following hybridisation. Therefore we have the\npossibility of the DNA aiding transfer of electrons through the positive polymer layer\nand possibly affording a drop in impedance. We have within previous studies shown\nfacilitation of electron transfer between a gold surface and ferricyanide ion using an\nelectrode modifying self-assembled organic layer (Collyer et al 2003).\nAs yet we have not attempted to reverse the hybridisation, heating the electrodes or\nelectrostatic polarisation may reverse hybridisation and regenerate the sensor. Care\nwould have to be taken however that we simply did not remove all the DNA from the\nelectrode and in view of the low potential cost of the electrodes it would be simpler\njust to use each sensor once.\nDNA Hybridisation; Interrogation via Ellipsometry.\nAdsorption of herring and salmon ssDNA was studied independently with optical\nellipsometry. Typical results of these measurements are shown in Fig. 6 as spectra of\nan ellipsometric parameter \u0394(\u03bb). First, the samples with freshly deposited ssDNA\nwere measured, then a ssDNA solution was injected and after 3 hours flushed out with\nfresh buffer. The sample was then re-measured, the measurements were always\n12\ncarried out with the cell filled with a standard phosphate buffer solution. Ellipsometry\nis known to be a sensitive analytical tool for thin film study. The measured\nellipsometric parameters \u03a8 and \u0394, representing the amplitude ratio and phase shift \nbetween s- and p- components of polarised light, respectively, are related to the\nthickness and refractive index of thin films on the surface of light reflective substrate,\ne.g. silicon.\nFig. 6(a) shows a substantial vertical shift of \u0394(\u03bb) spectra, when a sample which had a\npreviously deposited layer of PEI\/ ssDNA was exposed to a solution of\ncomplementary ssDNA, while exposure of non-complementary ssDNA produces\nminimal spectral changes. A large downward shift of the spectrum in Fig. 6(a),\ncorresponds to an increase in the adsorbed layer thickness due to hybridisation, of the\nsingle stranded DNA possibly with formation of a double helix.\nHowever single strands of salmon and herring DNA do not hybridise with each other,\nand thus do not cause substantial changes of \u0394(\u03bb) spectra. Only a minimal spectral\nshift in the opposite direction (upwards) in Fig. 6(b) is observed; this could be\ninterpreted as a slight increase in the refractive index of the layer or a small loss of\nmaterial to solution.\nThe obtained results prove independently the binding of single strand DNA molecules\nfrom the solution to the complementary molecules adsorbed electrostatically onto PEI\nlayer. Binding occurs when we have a herring-herring or salmon-salmon match but\nnot when the DNAs are mismatched.\n13\nConclusions\nPolyethylenimine, polyaniline and polydiaminobenzene modified electrodes\ncontaining single-stranded DNA have been shown to undergo hybridisation upon\nexposure to complementary single-stranded DNA. These hybridisation events have\nbeen interrogated by an AC impedimetric approach with the results showing that\ncomplementary DNA hybridisation gives rise to a lowering of the capacitive\nproperties of the electrode\/polymer film in solution. The clearest differential occurs\nfor both polyethylenimine and polyaniline electrodes, polydiaminobenzene showing\nsome unselective binding. Both approaches have their advantages, however the use of\npolyaniline allows finer control and monitoring of the deposition process. Large\nmulti-electrode sheets could be screen-printed and electrodeposited which would still\nallow mass production and the resultant lowering of costs.\nEllipsometric measurements have confirmed that species selective binding occurs at\nsilicon surfaces, and in the first case we have demonstrated species differentiation\nbetween two species of fish, namely herring and salmon.\nWe have described a simple electrochemical approach for detection of DNA\nhybridisation at an electrode surface. The sensor developed is of a simple format and\nis inexpensive to manufacture and therefore holds promise for use as a disposable\nsensor strip. It shows high species selectivity and reasonable response times. Future\nwork will be focussed towards allowing faster response times and greater specificity\nby the use of shorter DNA fragments of specific sequence immobilised within a\npolymer matrix.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank the BBSRC for funding for FD as part of the Centre\nfor Bioarray innovation within the post-genomic consortium.\n14\nReferences\nArnaut L.G. and Formosinho S.J., 1996, Theoretical studies of intramolecular electron\ntransfer reactions: distance and free energy dependences.
