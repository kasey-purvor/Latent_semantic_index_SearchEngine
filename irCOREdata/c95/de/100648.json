INTRODUCTION\nDuring the last few years, carbon nitride and its counter-\npart, amorphous carbon nitride \u0001a-CNx\u0002, has emerged as a\nmaterial of high technological and scientific interest.1\u20136 The\ninterest in carbon nitride has been renewed due to its poten-\ntial as an electronic thin film for both cold cathode displays7\nand electrode materials in electrochemical studies of water\ntreatment.8 Electronic properties have been reported for both\nhydrogenated and nonhydrogenated amorphous carbon ni-\ntride. In particular, it is found that nitrogen incorporation has\na beneficial effect on electric field emission at low micro-\nscopically applied fields by reducing the threshold electric\nfield.9,10 The efficient inhibition of redox decomposition re-\nactions of water using a-CN or a-CN:H electrodes over a\n3\u20134 V potential window, as compared to only about 2 V for\nmetal electrodes, has also introduced many more potential\napplications.11,12 Additionally, the deposition of nitrogen-\ncontaining amorphous carbon has received particular atten-\ntion following the theoretical predictions of an ultrahard\nsilicon-nitride-like phase, i.e., \u0001-C3N4.13,14 According to\nthese predictions, this phase would have insulating proper-\nties, hardness, and thermal conductivity comparable to that\nof diamond.\nCarbon nitride thin films can be deposited by a variety of\ndeposition techniques, namely sputtering,15 plasma enhanced\nchemical vapor deposition,16,17 filtered cathodic vacuum arc\n\u0001FVCA\u0002,18,19 electron cyclotron wave resonance \u0001ECWR\u0002,20\nmass selected ion beam deposition,21 and integrated distrib-\nuted electron cyclotron resonance.22 Among the deposition\ntechniques, pulsed laser deposition \u0001PLD\u0002 \u0001Refs. 23 and 24\u0002\nis a well-established technique for a-CNx thin film deposition\nthat allows for the tuning of the structural, optical, and elec-\ntronic properties under varying growth conditions. Under-\nstanding the structure and the physics of amorphous carbon,\nas well as its alloys, is essential to improve electronic prop-\nerties of carbon-based amorphous semiconductors such as\ncarrier mobility, dielectric properties of low k carbon-based\nfilms,25\u201327 as well as electron emission from carbon cold\ncathodes.7\nThis study aims to investigate a series of PLD grown\ncarbon nitride films with the aim of correlating the micro-\nstructure with the optical and the electronic transport prop-\nerties for varying laser fluences and N2 pressure.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nA. Film deposition\nPLD of nonhydrogenated carbon nitride films have been\ninvestigated quite extensively over the past years. Most films\nhave been produced by deposition onto a suitable substrate\nfollowing nanosecond ultraviolet pulsed laser ablation \u0001PLA\u0002\na\u0002Electronic mail: y.miyajima@surrey.ac.uk.\nb\u0002Author to whom correspondence should be addressed.

The\nchamber was back filled with N2 during thin film deposition.\nThe incident laser beam was directed through one of the\nchamber side arms that was sealed with a quartz window and\nfocused onto the target at 45\u00b0 to the surface. The target, a 10\ncm in diameter disk of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite\n\u0001Kurt J. Lesker, 99.99% purity\u0002, was rotated to minimize\nrepeated ablation of the same spot. A KrF Lambda Physik\nexcimer laser \u0001LPX 210i\u0002, operating at 248 nm with 25 ns\nfull width at half-maximum \u0001FWHM\u0002 pulse duration, was\nused as the UV pulsed laser source. The surface of the target\nwas cleaned using laser ablation with a laser fluence of\n4 J \/cm2 before depositions. The substrates were placed 6\ncm from the graphite target. A series of a-C and a-CNx films\nwere deposited onto quartz, c-Si, and mica substrates at laser\ndensity power between 4 and 12 J \/cm2 for various nitrogen\npressures with the repetition rate of 10 Hz. Quartz and c-Si\nsubstrates were cleaned using a series of organic solvents,\nrinsed with de-ionized \u0001DI\u0002 water, and dried using N2 gas.\nDeposition on mica was carried out immediately after cleav-\ning. The typical thicknesses of the PLD deposited films were\naround 30 nm.\nB. Electron energy loss spectroscopy\nThe sp2 content of our films was estimated using elec-\ntron energy-loss spectroscopy \u0001EELS\u0002 technique.19,31\u201333 The\nsp2 fraction can be obtained from EELS using the peak cor-\nresponding to a transition from the occupied 1s to empty \u0003\u0001\nstates in the carbon K edge spectra. The area of the peak was\nnormalized within the region up to 294 eV and the area of\nthe peak was compared with graphite that is 100% sp2\nbonded carbon.34 Additionally, the nitrogen content can be\nevaluated by comparing the carbon K edge and a nitrogen K\nedge.35 The valence electron density of the film can be evalu-\nated from plasmon energy in the low loss spectrum. It must\nbe noted that the density of the film can be obtained assum-\ning that the number of valence electrons is four for carbon\nand five for nitrogen.36\nA CM200 Philips Supertwin transmission electron mi-\ncroscope \u0001TEM\u0002 operating at 200 kV with a LaB6 filament\nwas used for measurements with a Gatan Imaging Filter\nGIF2000 spectrometer for EELS. Films with a thickness of\n30\u201370 nm were floated off from the mica substrate by im-\nmersing in DI water and then placed on copper TEM grids.\nThe obtained EELS spectra and results derived for the films\u2019\ndensity, sp2 and nitrogen content for varying nitrogen pres-\nsures, and laser power densities are shown in Figs. 1 and 2,\nrespectively.\nC. Raman spectroscopy\nRaman spectroscopy is one of the most popular and\npowerful techniques for the nondestructive analysis of amor-\nphous carbon and its alloys that provides important structural\ninformation.37\u201340 Unpolarized visible Raman spectra were\nobtained using the 514.5 nm line of an Ar+ laser. A Renishaw\nmicro Raman system 1000 spectrometer was used with a\nlaser output of 15 mW, which resulted in an incident power\nat the sample of about 1 mW.\nThe recorded spectra between 800 and 1800 cm\u22121 are\nshown in Fig. 3. As a consequence of resonance effects, Ra-\nman is much more sensitive to \u0003 bonds than to \u0004 bonds. In\naddition to the second order TO peak of the Si substrate at\nabout 960 cm\u22121, the spectra show the usual amorphous car-\nbon vibrational features, namely a G peak at\n1500\u20131580 cm\u22121 and a weaker D peak around 1350 cm\u22121.\nThe G mode is the bond stretching mode between two\nsp2-hybridized C sites \u0001olefinic or aromatic\u0002 while the D\nmode is the breathing motion of sp2-aromatic rings usually\nactivated with disordered carbon where the graphene net-\nwork has been disrupted.\nThe Raman spectra was curve fitted using the\nBreit-Wigner-Fano41,42 line shape to the G peak and Lorent-\nzian line shape to the D peak.37 The fitting results for the\nintegrated D and G intensities ratio, i.e., the G line width and\nthe G line position \u0003\u0005max \u0001Ref. 37\u0002\u0004, are shown in Fig. 4.\nD.

The SE provides\nthe complex refractive index and allows the energies Eg \u0001for\nthe onset of the optical transitions\u0002 and E04 \u0001where the ab-\nsorption \u0006=104 cm\u22121\u0002 to be obtained. A four-parameter\nmodel \u0001A, C, Eg, and \u0007inf\u0002 is sufficient to describe the optical\nfunctions of the thin film to the accuracy of the ellipsometer.\nJellison and Modine44 developed this model using the\nTauc joint density of states \u0001DOS\u0002 and the Lorentz oscillator.\nThe imaginary part \u0007i of the dielectric function is given by\nthe product of the imaginary part of Tauc\u2019s dielectric func-\ntion with the Lorentz one. In the approximation of parabolic\nbands, Tauc\u2019s dielectric function describes interband transi-\ntions above the band edge. The new expression for \u0007i is set\nup as\n\u0007i\u0001E\u0002 = \u0005 AEoC\u0001E \u2212 Eg\u00022\u0001E2 \u2212 Eo2\u00022 + C2E2 \u00b7 1E\u0006 for E\b Eg , \u00011\u0002\n\u0007i\u0001E\u0002 = 0 for E\t Eg, \u00012\u0002\nwhere Eg is the optical band gap, A is the strength of the \u0007i\npeak, C is the broadening term of the peak, and E0 is the\npeak central energy; thus E0 is always larger than Eg. The\nreal part \u0007r of the dielectric function is derived from the\nexpression of \u0007i using the Kramers-Kronig integration.\nThe TL expression is consistent with known physical\nphenomena within the limitations of the model. At large E,\nthe \u0007i\u0001E\u0002 of the TL model\u21920. This is consistent with ob-\nserved behavior in the x-ray and \n-ray regime, where it is\nknown that the absorption coefficient is very small. Further-\nmore, \u0007i\u0001E\u0002=0 below Eg. The only mechanisms that give a\nnonzero value of \u0007i\u0001E\u0002 below the band gap are those that are\nexplicitly ignored in the TL model, such as Urbach tail ab-\nsorption and vibrational absorption in the infrared. Finally,\nthe TL expression is consistent with the Kramers-Kronig\nderivation in that \u0007r\u0001E\u0002 is determined by Kramers-Kronig\nFIG. 2.

The high frequency dielectric constant \u0001\u0007inf\u0002 is an\nadditional fitting parameter that prevents \u0007r from converging\nto zero for energies below the band gap.\nThe fitted parameters of the TL model, as well as the\nrefractive index \u0001n\u0002 and the extinction coefficient \u0001k\u0002 disper-\nsions, are shown in Figs. 5 and 6, respectively. Here it should\nbe pointed out that the model for inhomogeneous films,\nwhich is usually expressed by the volume fraction of void,\nwas used.\nE. Ultraviolet-visible-near infrared optical\ntransmittance\nA Cary 5000, Varian ultraviolet-visible-near infrared\n\u0001UV-VIS-NIR\u0002 spectrometer was used for the optical trans-\nmittance measurements in the range between 190 nm\n\u0001\u00076.5 eV\u0002 and 3000 nm \u00010.4 eV\u0002 in the dual beam mode.\nFilms deposited on quartz substrates were used for these\nmeasurements.\nThe optical transmittance spectra is provided with\ncomplementary optical characteristics, namely, E04 \u0001corre-\nsponds to the absorption coefficient of 104 cm\u22121\u0002 and the\nTauc optical band gap.

A circular top electrode\nwith an area of 1.5\u000b10\u22124 mm2 was fabricated using a\nshadow mask. The top electrodes were dc sputtered and com-\nprised of 50 nm of Cr coated with 50 nm of Au. The thick-\nness of a-CNx films was about 30 nm.\nElectrical measurements were carried out using a\nKeithley 236 source meter with a temperature controlled\nstage. The electrical characteristics at high electric fields\nwere measured at room temperature. In order to evaluate the\nactivation energy at low electric fields, the temperature was\nvaried between room temperature and 80 \u00b0C. The Current\nDensity-Electric Field characteristics are shown in Fig. 8.\nThe activation energy Ea is plotted out in Fig. 7, which was\nderived by assuming an Arrhenius relationship between cur-\nrent and inverse temperature.\nG. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy\nScanning tunneling spectroscopy \u0001STS\u0002 experiments\nwere performed at room temperature in a commercial ultra-\nhigh vacuum scanning tunneling microscope in the ultra high\nvacuum \u0001UHV-STM\u0002 \u0001Omicron VT multiscan STM\u0002\nequipped with a scanning electron microscopic column using\nelectrochemically etched tungsten tips. During the experi-\nment, the base pressure in the UHV chamber was 2\n\u000b10\u221211 mbar. The STS current-voltage curves were mea-\nsured in the range of \u22121.5 to \u00021.5 V for at least 16 positions\non a 100\u000b100 nm2 image, and are averaged in order to\nobtain the DOS corresponding to a large area. Two samples\nwere measured, and both a-C and a-CNx films were depos-\nited with the laser fluence of 4 J \/cm2.\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nPLA of graphite results in the deposition of quite differ-\nent carbonaceous structures depending on the pressure of the\nambient gas in the chamber. The energy of the species in-\nvolved with the growth can also be changed by applying an\nexternal bias to the chamber. A comparison of the PLA de-\nposited material to that deposited using the conventional ca-\nthodic arc process can be found in the literature.45 Henley et\nal.28 investigated the PLA mechanism of a graphite target in\na chamber that contains Ar. The energy of the ablated carbon\nions exceed 100 eV, the optimal energy for sp3 bond forma-\ntion, in the vacuum when a laser fluence of 10 J \/cm2 is\nused. When the Ar pressure is increased due to the additional\ncollisions of the gas ions with its concomitant decrease in\nmean free path, the plume speed decreases. When the Ar\nbackground pressure exceeds 20 mTorr, a shockwavelike\nplume movement is observed and the speed reduces to\naround 8 km\/s, 400 ns after the ablation. The speed reduces\nto 2.6 km\/s after 800 ns with the Ar background pressure at\n154 mTorr. Additionally, Fuge et al.46 investigated the plume\ndynamics during nanosecond and femtosecond ablations of\ngraphite in nitrogen. These studies must be carefully consid-\nered in order to understand the microstructural differences\ninitially revealed by EELS and Raman.\nFollowing Fuge et al.,46 a nitrogen background pressure\nbetween 20 and 80 mTorr was chosen. This is because the\nplume shows a shockwavelike propagation for pressures\nabove 20 mTorr, meaning that the transport of the carbon\natoms\/clusters shows diffusive rather than ballistic character\nat this pressure range. The most important factor that con-\ntrols the deposition process as well as the nitrogen incorpo-\nration \u0001and consequently the films structure\u0002 is the number of\nthe collisions that occur between the nitrogen molecules and\nthe laser ablated carbon atoms\/ions\/clusters in the chamber\nonce the nitrogen gas is introduced. The mean free path of\nthe nitrogen gas at the pressure of 0.75 mTorr \u00011 mbar\u0002 has\nbeen reported to be about 5 cm.47 Taking into account that\nthis distance is shorter than the distance between the sub-\nstrate and the target \u00016 cm in our experimental setup\u0002, and the\nnitrogen pressure is much higher \u000120\u201380 mTorr\u0002, we can\nsafely assume that at least one collision of the ablated carbon\nspecies with a nitrogen molecule is expected before the car-\nbon atom\/cluster reaches the substrate. In such a diffusive\ntransport regime, the nitrogen is expected to be introduced\ninto the film microstructure. It is clear then that the increase\nin the nitrogen pressure results in an increase in the multiple\nscattering and reduces the speed of the plume \u0001or equiva-\nlently the carbon species\u0002. The small but notable decrease of\nthe film\u2019s density for increased nitrogen pressure \u0003Fig. 2\u0001c\u0002\u0004\ncan be attributed to the reduced energy of the carbon species\nincident on the substrate. Similar results have been reported\nfor PLA of graphite in an Ar atmosphere.28 Figure 2\u0001b\u0002 dem-\nonstrates that the nitrogen pressure seems to have almost no\neffect on the nitrogen content. It has been shown that the\npeak of the emission of the CN radicals appears at about 8\nmm from the target at a nitrogen background pressure of 10\nmTorr.46 Additionally, the mean free path of nitrogen at this\npressure is estimated around this distance, assuming that the\nFIG. 8.

Higher laser\nfluences ablate more energetic carbon species.48 These spe-\ncies have a higher probability of reacting with nitrogen and\nforming CN radicals, resulting in higher nitrogen incorpora-\ntion, as shown in Fig. 2\u0001b\u0002. One of the reasons for an in-\ncrease in the sp2 content with increasing nitrogen pressure\n\u0003Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002\u0004 is due to the decrease in the plume speed as a\nresult of collisions between the carbon species and the nitro-\ngen molecules. The pressure range is sufficient to let these\ncarbon species experience diffusive transport before reaching\nthe substrate, and the incident speed is not high enough to\ncreate high sp3 fraction films. Furthermore, N, which prefers\nto bond in a planer sp2 configuration, dictates bond forma-\ntion in the plume, which then gets transported to the sub-\nstrate.\nThe above trends are confirmed by the Raman spectra\ncharacteristics that are shown in Fig. 3 and the analysis that\nfollows in Fig. 4. Indeed, the G peak remains almost constant\nwith increasing nitrogen pressure \u0001i.e., the nitrogen content\u0002.\nThis indicates that N addition has replaced the C=C olefinic\ngroups with aromatic groups. Figure 4\u0001c\u0002 shows the G-line\nwidth variation as a function of the nitrogen pressure. Just to\nnote that the G peak width indicates the bond angle distor-\ntions in the excited configurations. It has been reported49 that\nthe G-line width decreases with increasing N content, indi-\ncating loss of disorder of small clusters for higher N content.\nIn the nitrogen pressure range of 20\u201380 mTorr, where the\nresults in a nitrogen content is about 25 at % in our films, no\nG-line variation has been observed. The I\u0001D\u0002 \/ I\u0001G\u0002 ratio \u0003Fig.\n4\u0001a\u0002\u0004 shows the same trend. A major effect of N incorpora-\ntion is the increase in the clustering of the sp2 phase, which\nis indicated by the D peak. The I\u0001D\u0002 \/ I\u0001G\u0002 ratio variation\nwith increasing nitrogen content confirms that the fundamen-\ntal dependence of I\u0001D\u0002 \/ I\u0001G\u0002 is on sp2 clustering.\nThe TL SE model fitted parameters are shown in Fig. 5.\nIf the valence and the conduction bands are treated as single\npeaks, the peak position of a-CNx should shift toward the\nFermi level, compared with a-C, since the \u0004 and \u0004\u0001 bands\nbecome smaller in comparison to the \u0003 and \u0003\u0001 bands, which\nbecome larger. This explanation can be supported by the\nEELS K edge data \u0001see Fig. 1\u0002, which can be treated as a\nmodification to the shape of the conduction band. This ex-\nplains the drop observed in the mean peak position E0 and\nthe peak strength A, and the constant value of the broadening\nfactor C. What is remarkable is the small increase in the\noptical band gap considering the large increase in nitrogen\nbackground pressure.\nFigure 7 shows the optical band gap \u0001both Tauc and E04\u0002\nthat was derived using different techniques. These results are\ndifferent to those reported in Ref. 49 where nitrogen incor-\nporation decreases the optical band gap due to an increase in\nthe sp2 content of the film and its consequences. Similar\nresults were reported on ta-CNx deposited using FVCA and\nECWR.50 On the other hand, dc sputtered low sp3 fraction\na-CNx shows an increase in optical band gap with increasing\nN\/C ratio.50 However, in the latter cases, the optical band\ngaps are larger than those of the present study; thus there\nmust be another mechanism that reduces the optical band gap\nin PLD a-C and a-CNx films.\nThe increasing optical band gap may be attributed to the\ndecreased defect density in the band gap since the films get\nless dense. The obvious difference in the optical properties of\nthe nitrogen free films grown at different laser fluences is due\nto the fact that the higher laser fluence forms higher quanti-\nties of sp3 bonded material. Higher sp3 fraction films show\nhigher E0 and A values for the nitrogen free a-C, especially\nthose grown at 12 J \/cm2. The small optical band gap a-C\nfilms with high sp3 fraction and dense film properties have\nbeen reported elsewhere,51 and the reduced band gap is at-\ntributed to the high internal stress. The internal stress in the\na-C films deposited at more than 12 J \/cm2 is considered to\nbe high due to the films being able to delaminate easily,\nwhereas a-CNx films have good adhesion to the substrates.\nThus, the high sp3 fraction films have high internal stress\nthat may create localized states in the band gap and thus\ncontribute to a low optical band gap.\nThe J-E characteristics are shown in Fig. 8. It appears\nthat the films become more resistive with increasing nitrogen\npressure for both laser fluences used. This is consistent with\nthe SE analysis, which concluded a lower defect density with\nincreasing nitrogen pressure, as well as the optical analysis,\nwhich showed an increased band gap that would increase the\nresistivity of the films. The free carrier concentration in a\nsemiconductor has an inverse exponential relationship to the\noptical band gap. It was found that some samples were under\nstress and failed at high electric fields. In most cases, electric\nfields of less than 2.0\u000b105 V \/cm should be applied for re-\nproducible results for these films due to their high stress. In\nthe case of a-CNx deposited at 80 mTorr and a laser fluence\nof 4 J \/cm2, the field was limited to 1.0\u000b105 V \/cm.\nFigure 7 also show the activation energy Ea at low elec-\ntric fields, which has comparable values to those of the op-\ntical band gap evaluated using different techniques.\nA possible conduction mechanism for such low electric\nfields was reported to be band tail hopping,52 via defects\n\u0001band tail\u0002 above the Fermi level. The defect states are\nthought to lie above the Fermi level and the electrical acti-\nvation energy indicates the energy between the Fermi level\nand the defects. If the Fermi level lies in the middle of the\nband gap, band tail hopping seems to occur at the bottom of\nthe empty \u0003\u0001 band. It is consistent with the similar values\nmeasured for both of Ea and optical band gaps.\nFigure 9\u0001a\u0002 shows the dielectric constant that was ob-\ntained from SE. In general, there is a good correlation be-\ntween the dielectric constant obtained from SE and that ob-\ntained from conductivity measurements. Such a correlation is\nfound for a-C and a-CNx grown at 20 mTorr of nitrogen gas\n\u0001see Fig. 9\u0002.\nThe conductivity of a-CNx appears to be independent of\nthe laser fluence and it decreases with increasing nitrogen\npressure. This may also be related to the decrease in the\nnumber of defects in the band gap due to the decrease in the\ninternal stress. It is believed that the decrease in the defect\nstates at the midband gap is reflected by the decrease in the\nactivation energy at low electric fields. In this region, the\nconduction mechanism appears to be hopping within a defect\n063701-6 Miyajima et al. J. Appl. Phys. 104, 063701 \u00022008\u0001\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/jap\/copyright.jsp\nband, and the conductivity decreases with increasing activa-\ntion energy and a decrease in the defect density within the\nband gap.\nThe conduction mechanism at high electric fields is nor-\nmally different to that at low fields.53 Figure 10 shows the\nlog of the current density versus the square root of the elec-\ntric field at room temperature as a function of the nitrogen\npressure for laser fluences of 4 and 12 J \/cm2. At electric\nfields higher than 104 V \/cm, there is a linear dependence,\nrevealing that the main conduction mechanism appears to be\neither Poole-Frenkel \u0001PF\u0002 bulk limited or Schottky barrier\ncontact limited conduction.\nFor these samples, two types of contacts were used. One\nwas the n+-Si substrate while the other was a Cr top contact.\nHowever, the J-E characteristics seem to be symmetric, in-\ndicative that the conduction mechanism is not contact domi-\nnated. Thus, we come to the conclusion that the conduction\nmechanism for these films could be a bulk limited process\nsuch as PF conduction.\nThe current density J due to PF conduction through the\nfilm is given by\nJ = eN\f\u0001E exp\b\u2212 \u0003\r \u2212 \u0001\u0001PF\/\n\u0002\tE\u0004kT \n , \u00013\u0002\nwhere\n\u0001PF =\t e3\n\u0003\u0007r\u00070\n, \u00014\u0002\n\r is the trap depth, E the electric field across the film, N the\ndensity of the neutral trapping centers, \f the effective mo-\nbility, and \n is a coefficient that changes from one to two,\ndepending on the number of the charged defects and the\ndegree of compensation. When \n=1 is satisfied, the formula\nis similar to the classical PF conduction model.53 Here, it\nshould be noted that the neutral trapping centers are not nec-\nessarily the same as the defects detected by electron spin\nresonance \u0001ESR\u0002, which detects unpaired spins.\nThe application of the classical PF \u0001\n=1\u0002 conduction\nmodel of a-C and a-CNx can provide us with an effective\ndielectric constant. These values, as well as those for the\nsquare of the refractive index n \u0001at 2 eV\u0002 assuming a low\nimaginary component, were derived from the TL model dis-\npersion curves \u0001Fig. 6\u0002 and are shown in Fig. 11 along with\nthose calculated from single wavelength ellipsometry. It is\ndemonstrated that the approximations that were used for both\noptical and electrical measurements are very consistent. Ad-\nditionally, the decrease in the refractive index \u0001at 2 eV\u0002 for\nincreasing nitrogen gas pressure is consistent with the de-\ncrease in the films density,54 as discussed earlier.\nIf the PF conduction mechanism dominates at high\nfields, then the activation energy should be proportional to\nthe square root of the electric field. A a-CNx film that was\ngrown at a laser fluence of 4 J \/cm2 in 20 mTorr nitrogen gas\nwas measured to check for the change in activation energy\nwith electric field, as shown in Fig. 12. The estimated trap-\nping center depth was found to be about 0.16 eV. In addition,\nthe product N\f\u0001 can also be evaluated using the above equa-\ntion. For the device used in Fig. 12, N\f\u0001 was estimated to be\nabout 3\u000b1015\u0001cm V s\u0002\u22121. Investigation using ESR provides\na defect density of less than 1021 cm\u22123 for nonhydrogenated\na-C \u0001Ref. 55\u0002 and 1018 cm\u22123 for sputtered a-CNx.56 Assum-\ning that the density of the neutral trapping centers is less than\nthis value, the mobility is higher than 10\u22124 cm2 \/Vs when\nFIG. 9.

This is consistent with the\nreported field effect mobility of a-CNx being up to about\n10\u22124 cm2 \/V s.57,58 The field effect mobility is estimated\nfrom low electric fields \u0001\u000e103 V \/cm\u0002 whereas the effective\nmobility in the conduction band used the PF plot at high\nelectric fields \u0001\b104 V \/cm\u0002. At low electric fields, the con-\nductive mechanism is thought to be a hopping process\nthrough the defect band, whereas the PF effect occurs at the\nbottom of the conduction band. Thus, the mobility estimated\nfrom PF plots can be higher than that extracted using field\neffect transistor measurements. It should also be pointed out\nthat band tail hopping has been reported in a-CNx films and\nthat the PF effect might occur through defects in the band\ntail22,52 instead of the edge of the conduction band.\nFigure 13 shows the normalized conductance of a-C and\na-CNx. The normalized conductance is proportional to the\nDOS, and a negative sample bias shows the valence band of\nthe films, whereas a positive sample bias shows the conduc-\ntion band of the films. From these DOS measured using STS\nunder UHV conditions, the gap of a-C \u0001\u00070.9 eV\u0002 measured\nappears to be larger than that of a-CNx \u0001\u00070.7 eV\u0002, which is\nin agreement with previous reports and literature with re-\ngards to ta-CNx but in disagreement with those results re-\nported for dc sputtered a-CNx.49,50 However, the optical band\ngap decreases when nitrogen is introduced. A remarkable\nfeature of Fig. 13 is the shallow slope of the DOS in the\nconduction band. This is thought to be the reason why the\noptical band gap is smaller than that reported in previous\nreports.49,50 The long band tail narrows the optical band gap\ncompared with the effective band gap for both a-C and\na-CNx films. This feature may be attributed to the high stress\nin these films.\nTherefore, the band diagram of PLD a-C and a-CNx can\nbe illustrated, as shown in Fig. 14. The DOS of carbon films\nconsist of \u0003 and \u0003\u0001 bands attributed to sp2 hybridization, and\n\u0004 and \u0004\u0001 bands associated with sp3 hybridization. Moreover,\nthe band tail exists between \u0003 and \u0003\u0001 bands. The optical\nband gap attributed to the transitions from the occupied \u0003 to\nthe unoccupied \u0003\u0001 bands, which are nonsymmetrical bands,\nwas confirmed with the DOS obtained by STS analysis \u0001see\nFig. 7 and 12\u0002.\nIV.

A series of techniques were\napplied for structural, optical, and electrical characterization,\nnamely, EELS, Raman spectroscopy, SE, and UV-VIS-NIR\nspectroscopy along with I-V measurements. It has been\nshown that nitrogen incorporation changes the sp3 fraction of\nthe films. Once nitrogen was incorporated, no strong depen-\ndence between the nitrogen gas pressure, the laser fluence,\nand the microstructure was found. However, the background\npressure during the deposition did affect the density, which\ncan in turn affect the stress in the films, and hence the local-\nized states in the band gap. Therefore, an increase in the\nnitrogen pressure decreases conductivity and increases the\noptical band gap. The presence of the long band tail is sup-\nported by the DOS close to the Fermi level obtained by STS\nmeasurements and is in agreement with the broadening fac-\ntor C obtained from SE. Thus, the presence of a long band\ntail should be carefully considered when using a-C and\na-CNx films deposited by PLD in electronic devices.\nTwo types of conduction mechanism were found for low\nand high electric fields. Band tail hopping appears to be the\ndominant conduction mechanism at low electric fields while\nPF conduction was confirmed to dominate conduction at\nhigh fields. The fact that transport is dominated by hopping\nbetween localized neutral defects suggests that shallow nitro-\ngen donors are not present in large concentrations.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors are grateful to the EPSRC Swindon, U.K.\nfor funding this program via a Portfolio Partnership award.\n1M.
