Magma transport\nand the compensating matrix deformation are commonly described by two-phase\ncompaction models, but melt production is less often incorporated. Melting is driven by\nthe necessity to maintain thermodynamic equilibrium between mineral grains in the\npartial melt; the position and amount of partial melting that occur are thus\nthermodynamically determined. We present a consistent model for the ascent of a one-\ndimensional column of rock and provide solutions that reveal where and how much partial\nmelting occurs, the positions of the boundaries of the partial melt being determined by\nconserving energy across them. Thermodynamic equilibrium of the boundary between\npartial melt and the solid lithosphere requires a boundary condition on the effective\npressure (solid pressure minus melt pressure), which suggests that large effective stresses,\nand hence fracture, are likely to occur near the base of the lithosphere. Matrix compaction,\nmelt separation and temperature in the partially molten region are all dependent on the\neffective pressure, a fact that can lead to interesting oscillatory boundary-layer structures.\nKeywords: partial melting; compaction; magma migration; mid-ocean ridges;\nfree boundary*A\nRec\nAcc1. Introduction\nBeneath mid-ocean ridges and in isolated mantle plumes, upwelling mantle rock\nundergoes partial melting. The production of melt and its subsequent migration\nare responsible for the creation of new oceanic lithosphere and for the occurrence\nof submarine and subaerial volcanism. Understanding the physical processes\ninvolved in this generation and movement of magma is important in helping to\nunderstand the thermal and chemical properties of the oceanic crust, and in\ndescribing how magma can come to be emplaced in magma chambers and feed\nvolcanic eruptions. This paper aims to provide a consistent mathematical model\nfor these governing physical processes.\nPartial melting occurs as a result of decompression melting\u2014hot crystalline\nrock ascending adiabatically from lower in the mantle finds itself above\nthe pressure-dependent melting temperature and begins to melt (figure 1).

Partial melting occurs where the geotherm\nexceeds the solidus temperature.\nI. J. Hewitt and A. C. Fowler2the rock continues to rise, it forms a two-phase mixture of solid and melt, which\nundergoes continual melting until, near the surface, the temperature drops and\nthe rock solidifies. Thermodynamically, the melt forms preferentially at the\nintersections of individual mineral grains that can be expected to form an\ninterconnected network (McKenzie 1984). The melt is therefore able to move\nthrough the porous solid matrix and, being less dense, will rise buoyantly.\nThe whole situation can be described by the general theories of two-phase\nflows with mass exchange between the phases (Drew 1983; Bercovici et al. 2001),\nand many authors have proposed equations to model partially molten material\n(Turcotte & Ahern 1978; Ahern & Turcotte 1979; McKenzie 1984; Fowler 1985;\nRibe 1985; Scott & Stevenson 1986; Spiegelman 1993; Bercovici et al. 2001).\nThese differ in some specifics, but have the same general form, and have been put\nto a variety of uses. Surprisingly little attention, however, has been given to\nposing and solving a full model for the partial melting process, which must\ninclude, for example, not only the governing equations but also consistent\nboundary conditions.\nThe first attempts to model the process were by Turcotte & Ahern (1978), who\nconsidered Darcy flow through a deforming solid matrix with the melting\nprescribed by an equilibrium relationship between temperature, pressure and melt\nfraction. The principal assumption they make is that the pressure in melt and solid\nare the same, stating that viscous deformation of the grains will readily occur over\nshort length scales (less than 100 m) to quickly equalize pressures. Effectively this\nallows the matrix to freely compact as the melt migrates upwards through it.\nIt is now realized that this compaction is in fact due to the difference in\npressure between the phases, which must therefore be accounted for in any model\nof the process, as is generally the case for other two-phase flows and particularly,\nfor example, in soil mechanics. Following the widely used form of the equations\nsuggested by McKenzie (1984), this pressure difference is commonly parame-\nterized in terms of a bulk viscosity z, related in some way to the normal shearProc. R. Soc. A\n3Partial meltingviscosity hs. The bulk viscosity essentially describes how easily a two-phase\nmaterial can be squeezed to extract the melt and, in the context of melt gene-\nration, will depend strongly on the melt fraction f. A number of arguments,\nbased on microscopic models, suggest that zwhs\/f (Batchelor 1967; Fowler\n1985; Sleep 1988; Bercovici et al. 2001).\nMuch of the work following McKenzie\u2019s original equations has neglected the\nmelting process and concentrated on the melt migration and the matrix motion\nwhen melt is somehow already in situ (Spiegelman & McKenzie 1987; Spiegelman\n1993; Spiegelman et al. 2001). Fully describing the onset of partial melting and\nplacing this within the wider context of mantle circulation clearly requires the\nthermodynamics to play a major part, and the often neglected energy equation\nmust therefore be included. The partial melt occupies only part of the ascending\nmantle and its position should be found by considering the thermodynamics; the\nboundaries are \u2018free boundaries\u2019, in the sense that their location is unknown a\npriori and must be found as part of the solution.\nThe free boundary nature of this problem was actually identified in the early\nwork of Ahern & Turcotte (1979), who locate the depth at which melting begins\nby considering the surrounding temperature field and ensuring continuity of\ntemperature gradients. Fowler (1989) describes the procedure to uncouple the\nfree boundary location from the interesting dynamics, which all occur within the\npartial melt region, a method that we will employ later in this paper. Besides this\nwork, there has been no comparable attempt to solve the partial melt problem in\nits proper context until the recent work by S\u02c7ra\u00b4mek et al. (2007), whose aims were\nsimilar to our own. Based on the two-phase formalism of Bercovici et al. (2001),\nthey considered the total melting of an ascending column of rock, correctly\nnoting the free boundary at which melting starts, although attempting to\ndetermine its position without suitable jump conditions.\nIn this paper we will review the equations describing the partial melt region\nincluding the temperature as a principal variable and discuss appropriate\nboundary conditions to apply to the partial melting that occurs beneath a mid-\nocean ridge. We provide solutions for the case of a one-dimensional upwelling\ncolumn of mantle such as might be appropriate directly beneath the ridge.\nThe situation differs from that considered by S\u02c7ra\u00b4mek et al. (2007), in that\nwe apply thermal boundary conditions at the Earth\u2019s surface that acts as a \u2018lid\u2019 on\nthe partial melt below. This causes a solidified boundary layer (the lithosphere) to\nform and its position, just as the position of the onset of melting, must be\ndetermined by conserving energy across the boundary. The requisite dynamical\nboundary condition to apply to the partial melt at this upper boundary has\npreviously been addressed only by Fowler (1989, 1990a) and is not entirely\nobvious; we show below that the requirement that the boundary itself is in\nthermodynamic equilibrium necessitates that the pressures in the solid and the\nmelt be equal there. Given the complexity of the modelling, the emphasis here is\non physics rather than chemistry and we treat the rock as a single thermodynamic\ncomponent. We hope that the additional effects when the mantle is more\nrealistically treated as multi-component can be incorporated at a later stage.\nGiven a prescribed mantle ascent rate (this we consider to be externally driven\nby the large-scale mantle circulation) and the temperature of the upwelling rock,\nour results allow for the full determination of where and how much partial\nmelting occurs.Proc.

Mathematical model\nThe situation we consider is shown in figure 2; the upwelling of mantle rock\ncauses a region D to become partially molten while the region DC, which will be\nreferred to as \u2018subsolidus\u2019, is solid. The boundary vD is unknown and our model\ntherefore consists of equations to describe the dynamics within D and DC,\ntogether with the boundary conditions across vD, at the fixed Earth surface and\nin the deep mantle.\n(a ) Conservation equations for a compacting partially molten region\nThe equations we use to model the partially molten region are for Darcy flow\nthrough a deforming solid matrix (Fowler 1985). More complicated equations\ngiving a systematic description of two-phase flow are possible in which many extra\nsurface effects can be included (Drew 1983; Fowler 1985, 1990a; Bercovici et al.\n2001; S\u02c7ra\u00b4mek et al. 2007); but once the usual simplifying assumptions are made\nconcerning interactive drag coefficients and the partitioning of surface forces, these\nare often reduced to Darcy\u2019s law. Since such details are available elsewhere and we\ndo not wish to confuse the issue by introducing more physics than necessary,\nwe start from the outset by assuming that melt flow obeys Darcy\u2019s law.\n(i) Mass and momentum conservation\nConservation of mass for each phase is expressed by\nvf\nvt\nCV$\u00f0fu\u00deZm\nr l\n; \u00f02:1\u00de\nK\nvf\nvt\nCV$\u00f0\u00f01Kf\u00deV \u00deZKm\nrs\n; \u00f02:2\u00deProc.

Our assumptions\nconcerning the pressure difference p sK p ls0 mean that the stresses do not\nequilibrate so readily, so local thermodynamic equilibrium means that the tempe-\nrature will depend on the interfacial stress which, since hl\/hs, is the liquid\npressure p l (Kamb 1961).\nThermodynamic equilibrium requires the continuity of free energy across the\ninterface, thus we require\nDGZDhKTDSZ 0; \u00f02:16\u00deProc.

We can\nin fact derive this condition, and the extra condition on the pressure, by the\nrequirement that the boundary itself is in thermodynamic equilibrium; we have\npreviously assumed a local thermodynamic equilibrium within the partial melt,\nwhere the temperature is thus related to the local stress conditions. At the\nboundary vD, we also suppose that macroscopic thermodynamic equilibrium\nmust be achieved between the partially molten and subsolidus regions, by\nensuring the continuity of the average Gibbs free energy across the boundary.\nWe can write the average free energy on either side of the boundary (see\nFowler 1990a) as\nGCZ hCs KTSs; G\nKZ \u00f0hsKTSs\u00deCf\u00f0DhKTDS\u00de: \u00f02:29\u00de\nIn the reference state in which p sZp lZp\nC, hsZh\nC so continuity requires\n\u00bdG \u0001CKZKf\u00f0DhKTDS\u00deZ 0; \u00f02:30\u00deProc.

From (2.26), this provides the extra condition on vD,\nf\u00f0p sK p l\u00deZ 0: \u00f02:32\u00de\nNote that this condition requires that either themelt fractionf is zero or the pressure\ndifference psKp l is zero. In practice, we expect the former to apply to the lower part of\nvD where the melting begins and the latter to apply to the upper boundary. From\n(2.27), this implies a continuous temperature gradient at the lower boundary, but\nsolidification and a jump in temperature gradient at the upper boundary.\nWe are forced to assume here that melt will solidify at the upper boundary of\nthe partial melt region. That this is not necessarily the case is manifestly true;\nmagma erupts from the surface and is known to be emplaced in magma chambers\nwithin the lithosphere. However, the processes that allow this to happen are not\nentirely clear; certainly, it seems that magmafracturing and transport up pre-\nexisting conduits within the lithosphere play a major part, but how these are\nconnected to the partial melt zone below is very much open to debate. Some form\nof localization of the melt flow, or tendency for the partial melt itself to undergo\nfracture, seem to be required.\nIn the absence of any definite idea of what precisely does happen at the top of\nthe partial melt region, we look for the simplest thermodynamically viable\nsolution, and therefore make the naive assumption that all the melt solidifies\u2014\nsolidification of this sort is referred to as underplating of the lithosphere.(d ) Non-dimensionalization\nWe expect to prescribe the mantle velocity that results from larger scale\nmantle convection, and our solutions will focus only on the one-dimensional\ncolumn of mantle directly beneath a ridge or plume axis. We label the surface of\nthe Earth yZ0, with y being the vertical coordinate. If no partial melting\noccurred, the mantle would rise steadily, the pressure profile would be lithostatic\np sZpmCrsg\u00f0ymKy\u00de and the melting temperature would be given instead of\n(2.17), by the lithostatic solidus,\nTLSZT0CGp sZTmCGrsg\u00f0ymKy\u00de: \u00f02:33\u00de\nThe depth ym here is a reference depth at which the lithostatic pressure is pm and\nthe lithostatic solidus is Tm. The adiabatic geotherm that the ascending rock\nwould follow would in some places be above the lithostatic solidus (figure 1), and\nthis is (approximately) the region that must therefore undergo partial melting.\nWe therefore choose the reference depth ym to be the depth at which the\nlithostatic solidus and adiabatic geotherm first intersect\u2014this should be near to\n(though as we shall see, not exactly) the depth at which melting starts. We take\nthis depth to be known, which effectively means that we prescribe the\ntemperature of the upwelling rock.Proc. R. Soc. A\nI. J. Hewitt and A. C. Fowler10Somewhere close to ym partial melting begins, and somewhere close to the\nsurface yZ0, the cold surface temperature is noted and the partial melting\nregion ends. We label these positions yb and ya, respectively, as shown in\nfigure 2. As discussed above, the exact positions of these boundaries must form\npart of the solution, being found from the conservation laws in \u00a72c. However,\nthe interesting dynamics are all contained within the partial melt region that\ntherefore attracts the majority of our attention; for this reason, we define\nanother vertical coordinate zZyK yb so that the partial melt occupies\n0!z! lhyaK yb. By taking a good guess for this depth l, we can find the\nsolution for the partial melt region, and then use the jump conditions at yb and\nya to precisely locate these boundaries that then define the actual depth l. In\nthis way, we can effectively separate out the solution within the partial melt\nregion and the determination of the free boundaries. A similar procedure was\noutlined by Fowler (1989).\nThe relevant length scale is the depth l (a priori we have only a guess at\nexactly what it should be, but it can be revised later) to which all lengths are\nscaled. The temperature within the partial melt follows the solidus, which\nwill be approximately given by (2.33); we thus define qZTKTm and scale\nqwrsglG.\nWe take the mantle velocity scale V0 to be prescribed\u2014it can be inferred by\nmeasuring the rate of spreading at mid-ocean ridges\u2014and the melting scale\nfollows from balancing the Clapeyron slope with the latent heat consumption in\n(2.14). The melt velocity is determined principally by buoyancy in (2.3), and the\nmelt fraction then follows from balancing divergence with melt production in\n(2.1). Thus, we scale\nmLwrscGrsgV ; fuw\nkf\nhl\nDrgw\nml\nr l\n: \u00f02:34\u00de\nWith the reference point ym, pm and Tm defined above, we scale the solid pressure\np sKpmwrsgl.

Density and viscosity also vary with temperature (this is what\ncauses mantle convection in the first place), but such effects will be ignored for\nthe purposes of this study. We take the values in (2.47) to be representative of\ntypical mantle conditions, but bear in mind that there may be significant\nvariations from these.

Our simplification of the equations will be slightly different from theirs\nbecause we make use of the fact that the melt fraction is everywhere small by\nneglecting terms of relative order f0.\nThe equations will be further simplified in our analysis of the next section by\nmaking the Boussinesq approximation rZ1, by setting l to zero (we do not\nexpect the adiabatic effects to be important), and by neglecting the terms of\norder 3d in the momentum equations. This last approximation is appropriate\nbecause the bulk viscosity zZhs=f is considerably larger than shear viscosity\nwhen the melt fraction is small; in the momentum equations (2.40) and (2.41),\nthis means matrix stress gradients are less important than effective pressureProc.

As has already been\ndiscussed, its position and size (indeed whether partial melting occurs at all)\nmust be found by considering the temperature of the surrounding rock.\nIn the one-dimensional situation we consider, and with the same approxi-\nmations as before, the equations (2.18)\u2013(2.21) for the subsolidus region simply tell\nus that the velocity is constant VZW0k, the pressure is lithostatic pZymKy\nand the dimensionless temperature therefore satisfies the steady-state equation\nW0qyZ\n1\nPe\nqyy: \u00f03:27\u00deProc.

Provided our original estimate of the length scale was good, the\nsolutions within the partial melt still hold with the true non-dimensional solutions\nbeing given by f\u00f0y\u00deZXK1=2f\u0002\u00f0yK yb\u00de and N\u00f0y\u00deZX1=2N \u0002\u00f0yK yb\u00de.\nWith the length scale known, the depth of the onset of melting now follows\ndirectly from (3.33), with the values of Nz(0) and N(0) coming from the partial\nmelt solution. In fact, our analytic boundary-layer solution allows us to find yb\nexactly; from (3.18), we had N\u00f00\u00deZdK1=3N^ 0 and Nz\u00f00\u00deZK1=d.

In fact, these two effects may\nhave counterbalancing effects\u2014in terms of our dimensionless parameters, yb!ym\nif dsN^ 0rPeW0=d\n1=3O1, and with the values in (2.37) this is the case.\nThe full solutions for the temperature of the ascending mantle column and the\nbehaviour of the partial melt region are shown in figure 5. The predicted\nthickness of the solidified lithosphere is approximately 2 km, considerably less\nthan the estimated thickness beneath mid-ocean ridges. This results from the\none-dimensional assumption that the rock continues to ascend all the way to\nthe surface, whereas in reality the cold rigid lithosphere will move sideways,\ndriven by the convective motion of the overlying plate.\nThe model equations in \u00a72 apply equally well to this more realistic two-\ndimensional situation, but the solutions are rather more complicated. The\nvarying mantle velocity alters the stress gradients driving melt flow, and the\nboundaries ya and yb will depend on the lateral coordinate. The same technique\nto determine the location of the boundaries will therefore not work and an\nalternative method of solution needs to be found.\nAlso shown in figure 6 is the predicted region of partial melt when the\nparameters are changed; as the mantle ascent rate W0 is reduced the size ofProc.

The continuity of temperature gradient at yb causes a\nprecursive decrease in the temperature of the subsolidus rock below. The jump in matrix velocity at\nya is necessary to ensure the total mass flux is continuous there.\nI. J. Hewitt and A. C. Fowler20the partial melt region decreases until, if W0 is too small, there is no partial\nmelting at all. The temperature of the ascending rock, which determines where it\nintersects the solidus, also influences the size of the partially molten region.Proc. R. Soc. A\n21Partial melting4. Discussion\n(a ) Thermodynamic boundary layer\nThe thermodynamic condition NZ0 at the upper boundary of the partial melt\nrequired a boundary layer in which the pressure has to adjust rapidly. This was\ndescribed by the phase plane in (3.26) and figure 4, which admits a unique\nsolution to match with the outer region provided 2P!EW\n1=2\n0 . With our chosen\nparameters in table 1, this is indeed the case, but it would not require a large\nchange for it not to be so.\nIf, conversely, 2POEW\n1=2\n0 , then the fixed point in the phase plane \u00f0W 1=20 ;W 1=20 \u00de,\nto which we must match, becomes a stable node or spiral. This change is associated\nwith the lines K\u00f0f\u00deZ0 and V \u00f0f\u00deZ0 crossing each other so that, when\n2POEW\n1=2\n0 , the trajectory coming from NZ0 must cross the line VZ0. This is\nonly possible by passing through the point GZVZ0, which looks like a degenerate\nsaddle point in the phase plane; thus although there aremany trajectories that spiral\ninto the fixed point, there is still a unique one that passes through this degenerate\nsaddle. This suggests that a unique boundary-layer solution should exist in which\nboth f and N show oscillatory decay towards the outer solution.\nThis somewhat intriguing behaviour can be related to the characteristics of the\nequations; including the time dependence in the boundary-layer analysis gives\n3ftCV \u00f0f\u00defZ ZG\u00f0f;N\u00de; NZ ZK\u00f0f\u00de: \u00f04:1\u00de\nThere is one real characteristic with speed V\/3. When 2P!EW\n1=2\n0 , the solution\nhas V!0 corresponding to the characteristics entering the boundary layer from\nbelow, whereas with 2POEW\n1=2\n0 the characteristics must change direction\nwithin the boundary layer and point outwards to the outer solution.\nSuch solutions are found numerically when we increase the value of the\nparameter P; figure 7 shows the steady state for PZ2. As KZ0 and VZ0 move\nprogressively further apart on the phase plane, the spiralling becomes more\npronounced, and there is the possibility that the effective pressure becomes\nnegative; this is shown in figure 7 for PZ10.\nAn exploration of parameter values does not show any obvious criterion that\nproduces these oscillatory solutions, and there appears to be no clear physical\nmeaning attached to the condition 2P!EW\n1=2\n0 , other than a certain\ncombination of physical properties; being a scaled inverse Pe\u00b4clet number, larger\nvalues of P imply greater relative importance of heat conduction compared with\nmatrix advection. The very large oscillations in which N approaches zero seem to\nbe unlikely, but are within the bounds of possibility, particularly if the ascent\nrate is small (less than 1 cm yrK1) and the melt is not too viscous.\nThe oscillations have their origin in the unusual thermodynamics; the effective\npressure controls the temperature, the matrix compaction and the melt\nmovement. These last two dynamical roles for the effective pressure require\nthat near the boundary of the partial melt there must be a very sudden change in\npressure, but the fact that this produces large temperature gradients which heat\nconduction would attempt to smooth out seems to force the solutions for N (and\ntherefore also f) to have the unusual oscillatory profile.Proc.

The boundary value of NZ0 at the top requires these oscillatory (but steady)\nsolutions that become more pronounced as P is increased; these can be compared with the phase\nplane in figure 3b.\nI. J. Hewitt and A. C. Fowler22(b ) Fracture initiation\nWe have assumed in this study that melt remains as a distributed porous flow\nand solidifies at the base of the lithosphere. Continued transport into the\nlithosphere requires localized flow through a conduit or fracture and will need a\nsufficiently large melt flux to avoid solidification. Magmafracturing (Spence et al.\n1987; Lister & Kerr 1991; Roper & Lister 2005), aided by the supply of large\nquantities of melt from below, may be possible if substantial flow localization\noccurs in the partial melt, and several mechanical and chemical instabilities have\nbeen suggested to do this (Spiegelman & McKenzie 1987; Stevenson 1989;\nAharonov et al. 1995; Spiegelman et al. 2001; Katz et al. 2006). Alternatively, the\nfracture could occur within the partially molten region and draw in melt from the\nsurroundings to establish an interconnected network of veins or dykes (Nicolas\n1986; Sleep 1988; Ito & Martel 2002). In either case, something must cause these\nfractures to be initiated.\nThe Griffith criterion suggests that such fracture should occur when the stored\nelastic energy becomes larger than the surface energy that is created when\nindividual grains are pulled apart. The stored energy has size approximately\ns2a3=E and the surface energy is approximately ga2, where a is the typical grain\nsize, g the surface energy, E Young\u2019s modulus and s is the applied stress.\nFracture therefore occurs if\nsOSh\nEg\na\n\u0001 \u00021=2\n; \u00f04:2\u00de\nwith typical values ofS of the order of 1 MPa (Sleep 1988; Fowler 1990b). If t1 is the\nlargest principal deviatoric stress, the largest effective stress is sZp lK p sCt1,\ngiving the condition\nN!t1KS: \u00f04:3\u00deProc. R. Soc. A\n23Partial meltingThis suggests that the matrix will fracture if the effective pressure becomes\nsmall enough. At a spreading mid-ocean ridge, a rough estimate of deviatoric\nstress is t1whsV0=lw0:2 MPa using our previously given values, but this does\nnot take account of the temperature-dependent viscosity; as the rock cools\ntowards the surface, the viscosity will increase significantly from the 1019 Pa\nused above and stresses of several MPa or more are probable there. In this case\nt1OS, and since the upper boundary condition on the partial melt requires N to\nreduce towards zero there, the conditions for fracture initiation may well be met.\nThe possibility for oscillatory solutions to the boundary layer in \u00a74a also offer\nthe intriguing possibility that the fracture criterion may be met lower within the\npartial melt; this would enable the newly initiated fracture to grow by drawing\nin melt from the surroundings.\nFractures would occur normal to the largest extensional deviatoric stress t1;\nbeneath spreading mid-ocean ridges this is horizontal, so fractures will be vertical\nand allow for efficient transport of melt.5. Conclusions\nWe have proposed model equations for an upwelling mantle region, comprising\nboth partially molten and solid rock, with consistent conditions at the interfaces\nbetween these. The equations for the partial melt are essentially the same as\nthose of McKenzie (1984) and S\u02c7ra\u00b4mek et al. (2007), the differences arising from\ntheir simplification and use. Our work follows the related study of soil mechanics\nin using the effective pressure as a primary variable on account of its fundamental\ncontrol on the compaction of the matrix. The chief difference between our analysis\nand other authors\u2019 is then to make use of the fact that the melt fraction is small,\nand the bulk viscosity is larger than the intrinsic shear viscosity.\nThere has been little previous discussion in the literature of the appropriate\nboundary conditions for the partial melt region, although they must form an\nintegral part of the problem; thermodynamic equilibrium of the partial melt\nboundaries requires that either the melt fraction f or effective pressure N must\nbe zero there. The partial melt dynamics can be reduced to an unusual\ndegenerate pair of equations for f and N, (3.10) and (3.11), for which these\nconditions appear to determine a unique steady state.\nThe solutions for one-dimensional upwelling are shown in figures 5 and 6 and\nagree in many respects with other published results: the parabolic melt profile\n(Ahern & Turcotte 1979; S\u02c7ra\u00b4mek et al. 2007); the near-linear decrease in matrix\nvelocity; the viscous boundary layer near the onset of melting (Fowler 1990b;\nS\u02c7ra\u00b4mek et al. 2007); and the presence of a temperature precursor beneath the\npartial melt (Ahern & Turcotte 1979). Future work will hope to extend these\nsolutions to two dimensions, with lateral movement of both matrix and melt, but\nsolving the full problem in this case is by no means trivial.\nThe boundary-layer treatment of temperature and pressure gradients at the\nbottom of the partial melt allow an expression (3.35) to be derived for the depth of\nonset of melting. S\u02c7ra\u00b4mek et al. (2007) pointed out that including the density\ndifference rs1 will cause some extra problems near this boundary; there will be a\nsmall region in which the lower density melt requires an infinite pressure gradient\nto drive it through the matrix. The same behaviour occurs in our solutions if theProc. R. Soc. A\nI. J. Hewitt and A. C. Fowler24density difference is included, and it seems that some form of disequilibrium\nmelting may be required. With realistic parameters however the region over which\nthese issues arise is very small and would, for instance, make no discernible\ndifference to the graph of figure 4.\nThe boundary layer required at the top of the partial melt suggests an\ninteresting interplay between the thermal and dynamical roles of the effective\npressure, which can lead to an oscillatory profile (figure 7). A steady oscillatory\nstructure occurs when the relative effects of heat conduction to matrix advection\nwithin this layer are large enough. Very significant oscillations in which the\neffective pressure approaches zero may be possible if the mantle ascent rate is less\nthan approximately 1 cm yrK1. It is not clear how such effects will manifest\nthemselves in the two-dimensional case or when more thermodynamic\ncomponents are considered. We cannot therefore conclude that such structures\nwill necessarily exist, but rather that the role of heat conduction, when the\nsolidus is pressure dependent, may have some unexpected effects.\nThe boundary condition requiring N to go to 0 at the top of the partial melt\nwill necessarily produce conditions that make fracture according to (4.3) a\ndistinct possibility, and oscillations of the pressure may also cause this initiation\ncriterion to be met deeper in the partial melt. The requirement that melt\npressures must adjust to maintain thermodynamic equilibrium may therefore be\nthe cause of fracture and consequent continued transport into the lithosphere.\nA.C.F. acknowledges the support of the Mathematics Applications Consortium for Science and\nIndustry (www.macsi.ul.ie) funded by the Science Foundation Ireland mathematics initiative grant\n06\/MI\/005.
