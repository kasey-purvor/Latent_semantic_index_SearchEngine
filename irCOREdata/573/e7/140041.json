Introduction \nPorous-ceramic hydrostatic journal bearings have been successfully developed in a previous \nresearch program [1]. These bearings demonstrated superior stiffness and thermal performance \ncharacteristics compared with conventional hydrostatic journal bearings of the same size [2].  \nBecause of these advantages, porous ceramic hydrostatic bearings can be considered a viable \nsolution to the most severe demands for higher accuracy and overall performance levels \nrequired by ultra precision spindle bearing systems [3].  In satisfying these demands, the \nenabling of new machining process capabilities and product development [4] can be achieved. \nTypical applications of porous ceramic bearings are single point diamond turning and grinding \nspindles.  \nIn porous ceramic bearings, a journal bearing has the simple shape of a hollow cylinder. The \nexternally pressurized lubricant is supplied to the bearing gap through the extremely large \nnumber of integrated restrictors in the ceramic bearing\u201fs porous wall, as opposed to the more \ncomplex 4-6 restrictor\/pocket arrangement typically found in conventional metal hydrostatic \nbearings [5]. This results in an improved fluid film pressure distribution and an enhanced \nhydrodynamic component, which in turn improve the overall bearing load capacity and stiffness\n \n[6]. As a consequence of the porous bearing\u201fs operation principle, adequate processing control \nof the porous wall microstructure, in terms of uniform and predictable permeability, is of \nparamount importance.  \nTraditionally, powder metallurgy techniques have been employed to produce bronze or iron \nporous journal bearings. However, difficulties in controlling porosity consistently [7] often \nresults in variable permeability across bearing batches. Partial pore closure during final \n3 \nmachining [8], as well as localized plastic deformation caused by pressurized lubricant [9], both \nresulting in the alteration of the bearing permeability, have also been reported in the literature. \nThe most significant advantages of ceramics compared with traditional porous bearing materials \ncan be summarized as follows [1]: \n\uf0a7 can be machined without pore \u201esmearing\u201f \n\uf0a7 wear resistant \n\uf0a7 corrosion resistant \n\uf0a7 low coefficient of thermal expansion \n\uf0a7 can be used at relatively high temperatures  \nDespite all the benefits, porous ceramic hydrostatic journal bearings have yet to be embraced by \nprecision engineers and machine tool designers. So far, the main obstacle has been the intricacy \nof the bearing\u201fs processing method, hot isostatic pressing (HIP). This method proved to be \nsuccessful for the manufacture of journal bearings. However, so far, only journal bearings of \n50mm inside diameter and 50mm long have been achieved [1], which limits their application. \nThe HIP processing of porous ceramics essentially consists of vibration packing of mono sized \n7\u03bcm alumina powder, or bimodal blends of 1 and 13 um, followed by partial sintering in a high \npressure argon environment [1] [10]. However, a significant level of machining is required and \nHIP is a relatively expensive process. There are further disadvantages to HIP of porous ceramic \nbearings that limit their range of applications. For example, HIP of finer powders is difficult to \nachieve without agglomeration, resulting in non-uniform permeability. Also, it is difficult to \nachieve uniform permeability as the size of the components increase. Hence the need to \nestablish an optimized alternative porous ceramic processing method that enables the production \n4 \nof cost-effective porous ceramic bearings suitable for a wider range of high precision \nengineering applications.  \nAmongst the available ceramic processing routes, the starch consolidation technique (SC)\n \n[11] \noffers the ability to produce porous ceramic components with controllable porosity and with a \nwide range of shapes and geometries in a simple and cost effective manner. The foundations of \nthe starch consolidation technique were laid formally by Lyckfeldt and Ferreira [11]. Further \ndevelopments have been subsequently reported by other researchers [12] [13] [14]. In this \nprocessing technique, the starch granules act as binder and pore former. A ceramic slip is \nformed by mixing fine ceramic powders with starch and water. The slip is then cast into an \nimpermeable mould of the desired geometry and heated up to around 65\u00b0C for 1-2 h. This \ncauses the starch\/ceramic slip to \u201egel\u201f, and its consequent solidification into a ceramic body. \nAfter de-molding and drying of the ceramic body, the starch particles are burnt out in a \nsubsequent furnace operation that leads to the ceramic body densification, leaving \ncorresponding voids within the ceramic body. The resulting porosity is related to the amount \nand shape of the original starch granules. From a processing point of view, the bearing\u201fs level of \nporosity is effectively controlled by carefully manipulating the amount of starch in the slip and \nalso by adjusting other processing parameters such as the total solids loading and the sintering \ntemperature profile. The starch consolidation (SC) technique\u201fs systematic approach for \ncontrolling the component\u201fs porosity, in addition to its cost effectiveness as well as geometry \nand shape flexibility, make this technique very attractive for the manufacture of porous ceramic \nhydrostatic bearings. The simplicity and higher reliability of the SC over the HIP process, \nresults in estimated savings of 36% in the overall cost per single journal bearing [15].  \n5 \nThe authors have recently examined the performance of an ultra-precision alumina porous \nceramic hydrostatic journal bearing processed via the starch consolidation technique and have \ncompared this with the performance of a conventional hydrostatic bearing [16]. The SC bearing \nshowed improved performance characteristics over the conventional one in terms of stiffness \n(95%), temperature rise (50%) and flow rate (64%). The performance of this SC bearing was in \nagreement with that of a HIP processed bearing [2]. However, in depth details of the examined \nSC bearing processing have been not described before. \nIn this study, a new processing route for the manufacture of porous ceramic hydrostatic bearings \nis presented. Bearings of various geometries and shapes have been produced within a range of \nporous wall permeability values that are suitable for practical ultra-precision engineering \napplications.  \n2. Experimental \n2.1. Porous ceramic material requirements \nPermeability is widely acknowledged as the most significant physical property of a porous \nmaterial used for externally pressurized porous bearing applications. Consistent, uniform and \nrepeatable permeability are the most significant attributes demanded from a processing method \nfor externally pressurized porous ceramic bearings. The bearing\u201fs permeability coefficients, \ntogether with other design parameters such as the bearing gap and the bearing dimensions, \ndetermine the overall bearing performance [6].  \nPrevious mathematical modeling [2] based on the work of Chattopadhyay and Majumdar [6] has \nidentified an optimum value of permeability of 1 x 10\n-14\n m\n2\n,\n \nfor a typical ultra-precision \nhydrostatic journal bearing observing a limited deflection of 1\u03bcm. The model considers a \n6 \nbearing of 50 mm ID, length of 50mm and wall thickness of 6 mm, using a working gap of \n15\u03bcm. Permeability is closely related to the density and the pore size distribution of the ceramic \nmatrix.  Further modeling [2] based on the Kozeny theory [17] has been used to estimate a \ntheoretical value of fractional porosity of 20% and average pore-size of 3 \u03bcm, considering an \noptimum permeability of 1 x 10\n-14\n m\n2\n. Therefore these values for permeability, porosity and \npore size were chosen as initial material characteristics for the development of prototype \nbearings.  \n2.2. Processing of porous bearing samples  \nThe scheme proposed by Lyckfeldt and Ferreira [11] for the processing of porous ceramics by \nstarch consolidation was adapted for porous ceramic bearings. The shape of the porous bearings \nwas that of journal bearings (hollow cylinders) with an internal diameter (ID) of 50mm, length \nof 50mm and a wall thickness of 6mm. This size of bearing was favored because of readily \navailable porous ceramic performance test rigs, permitting the validation of porous journal \nbearing theory.   \nIn addition, porous ceramic discs were also processed for pore structure characterization. These \nwere primarily of 46 mm in diameter with thickness of 7 mm.   \n2.2.1 Slip preparation \nAll ceramic slips were prepared with mono-sized alumina powders. A range of alumina powders \n(Alcan Chemicals Europe, UK) with average particle sizes ranging from 0.5 to 7 \u00b5m were used \nin the present work. Native maize starch (CERESTAR UK Ltd., C*03401) was used as binder \n7 \nand pore former, while poly-acrylic acid, (Allied Colloids, Dispex A40), was used as a \ndispersant. Further details of the materials used in this work are listed in Table 1. \nAll powders, including starch were dried at 120\u00b0C for 24 h before mixing. Based on previous \nstudies [11], the slip total solids-loading was set to 59.1 volumetric %. The first variable was the \nstarch content and this was incremented in 10% volumetric steps of the solids loading. A second \nvariable was the alumina powder particle size, which ranged from 0.5 to 7\u03bcm for each alumina-\nstarch slip formulation. Slip batches of 500g solids were prepared. The alumina and starch \ndensity values used in the slip formulation were 3.98 g\/cm\n3 \nand 0.56 g\/cm\n3\n, respectively. The \neffects of the starch content and alumina particle size were subsequently examined with regard \nto the bearings physical properties such as density and permeability.  \nAfter the slip formulation and alumina particle size were defined for each batch, the required \nraw materials were weighed and poured into a 1 liter pot and ball milled for 24h at 66 rpm using \nspherical alumina grinding media ranging from 5 to 15.5 mm in diameter.  In order to avoid air \nentrainment, the ceramic slips were vacuum de-gassed before the forming operation.  \n2.2.2 Forming   \nThe ceramic slip was poured into the moulds and then heated in an air circulating oven at 65 \u00b0C. \nForming times varied from 2 to 5 hours depending on the slip volume and size of the castings. \nThe relatively complex hollow-cylinder shape of the journal bearing castings was achieved by \nusing moulds comprising of four parts: base, sleeve, lid and a core. Moulds were made of \naluminum alloy, due to its good strength, machinability, low density and corrosion resistance.  \nInitial trials showed that it was necessary to use a release agent, and the most effective was a \nnon-silicone type spray applied to the mould walls prior to casting.  \n8 \nAfter consolidation, the bearing castings were sufficiently strong to be de-molded without any \nsignificant deformation. The castings were then dried for 24 hours at 120\u00b0C prior to sintering. \n2.2.3 Binder burnout and sintering  \nThe furnace cycle processing defined by Lyckfeldt and Ferreira [11] was used. This included \nbinder burnout, pre-sintering and sintering steps carried out in one integrated operation. The \nequipment used was a box furnace fitted with a 0.1\u00b0C resolution controller. The temperature \nlimit was 1600\u00b0C. The starch granules were burned out at a slow heating rate of 1\u00b0C\/min up to \n500\u00b0 C, with 1 hour holds at 200 and 300\u00b0C. The pre-sintering and sintering operations were \nconducted within a similar heating rate observing temperature holds of 1 hour at 1000\u00b0C and 2 \nhours at 1550\u00b0C, respectively. These conditions were kept constant throughout the research.  \n2.2.4 Machining of porous ceramic bearings \nAlthough the bearings produced were near net shape, grinding was still needed to achieve the \nfinal size and the geometric tolerance necessary for assembly and subsequent bearing \nperformance testing. This required the ceramic bearings to be precision machined to enable \ntypical hydrostatic bearing radial gaps of around 20\u03bcm. Conventional grinding machines using \ndiamond wheels were used.  Typical roughness values achieved by the grinding process were in \nthe order of 1\u03bcm Ra.  \n2.2.5 Measurement of porosity and density \nPorosity and density measurements were conducted on ground bearing specimens, via BS EN \nISO 2738:2000 [18]. In this procedure, porosity is estimated using Archimedes\u201f principle. This \nessentially consists of weighing the porous specimens dried, fully impregnated while suspended \n9 \nin water, and finally free standing while impregnated to calculate open and closed porosity, bulk \ndensity and volume of pores.  \nThe bearing\u201fs bulk density, and open porosity were calculated using the following formulas: \n \nw\nw\nmm\nm\nB\n3\n2\n          (1) \n \nw\no\nmm\nmm\n3\n23\n100          (2) \n \nB is the bulk density of the test piece in g\/cm\n3, \u03beo is the open porosity percentage, m2 is the mass \nof the dried test piece in g, m3 is the mass of the fully impregnated test piece in g, mw is the mass \nof the fully impregnated test piece suspended in water in g and \u03c1w is the density of water in \ng\/cm\n3\n. \nWater impregnation of the specimens was conducted in a vacuum chamber. To ensure \nconsistency, all specimens were first dried for 24h at 120\u00b0C and the evacuation time was set to a \nminimum of 15 minutes, until all bubbling stopped. Weighing was conducted using an \nelectronic balance with a 1\u03bcg resolution.  \n2.2.6 Pore size distribution & microstructure \nIn the present study, pore size distribution was assessed by a combination of adjunct techniques: \nbubble test, water expulsion method and SEM micrograph studies. The bubble test and the water \nexpulsion test method were used to assess pores that correspond to the equivalent connecting \ncontact areas or necks between the larger spherical shaped pores left by the original starch \ngranules. The assessment of pores using the bubble test and the water expulsion method used \n10 \ndisc-shaped specimens that were 46 mm in diameter and thickness of 7 mm. These specimens \nwere processed with the same slip composition and conditions as those of the journal bearings. \nDensity and permeability measurements, together with microscopy studies confirmed that \ncomparable structures were produced. \nThe bubble test was performed in accordance with standard BS EN 24003 [19]. The test \nspecimen was first fully impregnated with de-ionized water (Figure 1). One of the specimen \nsurfaces was further covered with a known column of water (hw). Pressurized air was gradually \npassed through the specimen from the opposite surface. The pressure (p1) at which the first \nbubble begins to emerge on the top submerged surface, known as the first bubble point is used \nto calculate the maximum equivalent capillary diameter of the pore: \n \nww\nw\nhgp\nd\n1\nmax\n4\n         (3) \n \n \nWhere d max is the maximum circular-capillary-equivalent pore diameter in m, \u03b3w is the surface \ntension of water in N\/m, p1 is the absolute gas pressure upstream the specimen in Pa, \u03c1w is the \ndensity of de-ionized water in kg\/m\n3\n, g is the gravitational acceleration constant m\/s\n2\n and hw is \nthe height of the water column above the specimen in m. \nIn the water expulsion method, compressed air is passed through a porous specimen fully \nimpregnated with water. The compressed air pressure is gradually increased until it overcomes \nthe water\u201fs surface tension in the largest pore, expelling it. As the air pressure is increased, more \nwater is expelled from an increasing number of pores of decreasing size. The pressure difference \n11 \nP0 and volume flow across the specimen Q are measured throughout the procedure. This enables \nthe estimation of the equivalent pore size and the number of pores to be determined: \n \nrefp\npp\nP\n2\n2\n2\n2\n1\n0           (4) \n \nWhere p1 is the absolute air pressure upstream of the specimen in Pa, p2 is the absolute air \npressure downstream of the specimen in Pa and pref is the absolute air pressure in Pa at which \nflow rate is measured. For each pressure increment, the equivalent pore size corresponding to \nthe resulting differential pressure, and the number of pores contributing to the corresponding \nairflow increment were calculated using Gelinas and Angers method [20]. Figure 2 illustrates \nthe water expulsion method experimental set up. Successful characterization of the pore size \ndistribution using water expulsion for porous ceramic bearings has been reported before [2] \n[21].  \nScanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to study the sintered specimens\u201f microstructure. \nThese studies were primarily concerned with the overall pore structure formed by the voids left \nby starch particles. From a selection of journal bearings, one centre section was acutely sliced to \nexpose a surface layer extending through the bearing\u201fs wall. These specimens were then \nmounted in resin and progressively polished using diamond grinding discs. Finally they were \npolished using a fine diamond suspension on hard cloth. Following the specimens\u201f preparation, \na series of micrographs were taken.  \n12 \n2.2.7 Permeability measurements \nThe permeability of the porous ceramic journal bearings was measured using a specially \ndesigned test rig compliant with standard BS 5600 [22]. During measurement, each ground \njournal bearing was clamped axially between 2 flat sealing surfaces. Pressurized fluid applied \nfrom the outside of the bearing permeated inwards through the bearing wall. Figure 3 illustrates \nthe permeability measurement set-up for porous journals. Ten pressure drop and volume flow \nreadings were taken. The pressure differential across the bearing ranged from 0.1 to 1.0 MPa. \nThese pressures were measured using a differential pressure sensor connected across the \nbearing. Mass flow measurement was achieved by collecting the out-flowing test liquid with a \nweigh tank. The electronic balance had a resolution of 0.01 g. The test fluid was mineral oil \n(BP\u201fs HP0). Viscosity and density values of 1.45 mm2\/s and 787 kg\/m3 at 40\u00b0C and 20\u00baC, \nrespectively, were specified by the lubricant manufacturer. This information was complemented \nby a more thorough study conducted in accordance with BS 188 [23] and 4699 [24]. The oil \ntemperature was monitored throughout the measurement to compensate for variations in the \ndensity and viscosity values.  \nDarcy\u201fs law [22] describes the flow of fluids through porous materials at relatively low velocity, \nwhere only viscous factors are prevalent. This equation is used to derive the viscous \npermeability coefficient (\u03c8v) and can be written as follows: \n \nv\u03c8A\n\u03b7Q\ne\np\n                     (5) \n \n13 \nAt higher flow rates, inertial effects become significant and Forchheimer\u201fs equation [22] is used \nfor the determination of the viscous (\u03c8v) and inertial permeability (\u03c8i) coefficients:  \n \ni\nv \u03c8A\n\u03c1Q\n\u03c8A\n\u03b7Q\ne\np\n2\n2\n        (6) \n \nA is the area of the porous material normal to the direction of the fluid flow in m\n2\n, \u0394p is the \npressure drop in N\/m\n2\n, e is the thickness of the test piece in m, Q is the volume flow rate in \nm\n3\/sec, \u03b7 is the absolute dynamic viscosity in Ns\/m2, \u03c1 is the density of the test fluid is kg\/m3 is \nthe \u03c8v viscous permeability coefficient in m\n2\n and \u03c8i is the inertial permeability coefficient in m\n2\n. \nEquations 5 and 6 describe the relationship between pressure drop (\u0394p) and volume flow rate \n(Q).  \n3 Results & Discussion \n3.1 Processing of porous-ceramic bearings  \nTwenty six porous ceramic journal bearings and over 60 disc-shaped specimens were \nsuccessfully processed and ground using 21 different combinations of starch content (10 to 60% \nvol.) and alumina powders of 0.45, 1.1, 2.1, 2.7 and 4 \u00b5m. Journal bearings were primarily of 50 \nmm ID, length of 50 mm and wall thickness of 6 mm. However, a small number of journal \nbearings of 80 and 150 mm ID were also produced. Figure 4 illustrates some of the specimens \nproduced during this work.   \nCeramic-starch slips based on 7 \u00b5m alumina were also investigated. However, these invariably \nsegregated before the casting operation. For alumina powders ranging from 2 to 4 \u00b5m, there was \n14 \na maximum starch volumetric solids limit of 40%. Beyond this, journal castings were too weak \nand cracked or deformed at de-molding. Some disc-shaped specimens were achieved beyond \nthis limit, and this was a direct result of an easier de-molding procedure. Journal bearings with \nhigher starch contents (50-60% vol. %) were only successfully produced with the smaller \nalumina powders of 0.45 and 1.1\u00b5m. This was attributed to the better intrinsic particle packing \nassociated with smaller alumina particle sizes, strengthening the casting.  \nPreliminary trials using 0.45 \u00b5m alumina and starch contents below 40% vol. resulted in \nbearings with relatively high density and very low permeability for porous bearing applications. \nTherefore, processing at lower starch contents with this size of alumina was not further pursued. \nThe linear shrinkage observed was in the range of 15-18 % for the 0.45 \u00b5m alumina specimens. \nThe shrinkage increased for each increase of the starch content. The linear shrinkage of \nspecimens processed with alumina powders of 1.1, 2.1, 2.7, and 4\u00b5m, showed only a marginal \ninfluence of the starch content, with observed values of around 8, 6, 6.5 and 5.5 %, respectively. \n3.2 Density and porosity results  \nFigure 5 illustrates the variation of the relative density with the starch and original alumina size \nof 26 fired and ground 50mm ID, 62mm OD and 50 mm long journal bearings. Depending on \nthe alumina size and the starch content in the original ceramic slip, the specimens\u201f relative \ndensity varied from 51 to 81%. It was evident that there is a direct relationship between the \nbearings\u201f density and the amount of starch granules present in the original ceramic slip. Higher \nstarch contents resulted in lower density bearings, and vice versa. This effect was expected, as \nthe increasing amount of starch granules burned out during the furnace processing stage, leaves \n15 \nan increasing number of voids within the ceramic matrix. The same effect has been also reported \nby other authors [11-13].  \nThe density trend-lines corresponding to each alumina size showed very similar slopes, the main \ndifference being an offset in relation to each other. Smaller alumina particle sizes, showed a \nhigher y-axis intercept, and vice versa. This effect is mainly attributable to the sintering \ncharacteristics of each alumina particle size at the selected sintering conditions. This was also \nexpected, as for a given set of sintering conditions, smaller powders achieve higher densification \n[25].  \nThe density best fit lines were of linear form: \n \nbSmB vR            (7) \n \nWhere BR is the specimen\u201fs relative density (%), m and b are constants and Sv is the starch \nsolids volumetric percentage (%). The empirically derived constants for each alumina particle \nsize are summarized in Table 2. \nAlumina powders of 0.45 \u03bcm in size typically approach full density at the sintering conditions \nused, without any pore formers.  Density measurements conducted showed that the experimental \ndata trend-line intercepted the y-axis at 100%, agreeing well with this powder\u201fs expected \ndensity.  \nIn broad terms, it can be established that the sintered density of the SC porous bearings is first \ninfluenced by the sintering rate of the alumina size used, at the chosen sintering conditions. A \nsecond influence is the addition of starch, which can increase the porosity a further 20-25%, \n16 \ndepending on the size of the alumina used. The former has a stronger influence at the lower \nstarch contents, while the latter\u201fs influence becomes more evident at the higher starch contents. \nDensity measurements performed on porous ground discs used for the pore size characterization \nshowed that the density of these behaves in essentially the same manner as the density of the \njournal bearings for each alumina size and starch content formulation. Figure 6 illustrates a \ncomparison of density results between the journal and the disc-shaped specimens, showing a \nclose correlation.  \nDensity measurements conducted on disc-shaped specimens processed with alumina powders \nranging from 2 to 4 \u03bcm and starch contents above 40% vol. (not achieved for journal bearings), \nshowed that increasing the starch content did not result in a direct increase in porosity. The \nporosity of these specimens remained at approximately the same level observed at 40 % vol., \nshowing wider data scattering. This was in agreement with previous SC research. Researchers \n[11] have speculated that this phenomenon is a consequence of minor breakdown of the starch \nparticles during the consolidation stage, resulting in smaller, unstable pores excluded during the \nsintering operation.   \n3.3 Pore size distribution and microstructure results \nFigure 7 illustrates the results from the bubble-test for 25 measurements shown in relation to \ntheir original ceramic slip solids composition. The diameter of the pores ranged from 2 to 8.7 \n\u03bcm. In general, an increment in the starch content produced larger pores resulting from an \nincreasing number of contacts between starch particles. This behavior has been also observed by \nother researchers [11]. It was also noted that the specimens processed with larger alumina \npowder sizes generally resulted in larger pores for the same amount of starch. This was also \n17 \nexpected, as specimens processed with larger alumina powders had showed higher porosity. The \ndensity inconsistencies found at the higher end of the starch contents (50-60% vol.) were also \npresent during the bubble-test for the 1.1 and 4 \u03bcm alumina powders. These specimens showed \nsmaller pores than those observed for specimens processed with less starch.   \nThe testing procedure was limited to a pressure of 0.5 MPa. As a result, the pores of specimens \nprocessed with 0.45 \u00b5m alumina were too small to be characterized with this method. The same \ncondition applied to the water expulsion test.  \nTable 3 shows a summary of the results of the water expulsion test in terms of average, \nmaximum, median and modal pore size in relation to the starch content and alumina size. As \nwith the bubble test, it can be generally observed that the mean pore size increases with each \nincrement of the starch content and, consequently porosity. Also, larger pores were observed for \nthe larger alumina sizes for a given amount of starch, as a consequence of their lower \ndensification at the chosen sintering conditions. The average pores ranged from 1.2 to 3.5\u00b5m. \nThe largest pores, 7.5 and 7.4 \u03bcm, corresponded to 4\u03bcm alumina powders at starch contents of \n30 and 40% vol. Given their similar capillary nature, results for maximum pore size of the \nbubble test and the water expulsion method correlated well. The largest error observed in \nmaximum pore size between the 2 techniques was 1.1\u00b5m.  \nFigure 8 shows the typical microstructure of sintered journal bearings produced with 4\u03bcm \nalumina and 20% vol. starch content. It can be readily appreciated that the voids left by the \nstarch particles dominate, with the pores appearing well dispersed overall, both in terms of \ndistribution and separation. The pores were of a semi-spherical shape and of approximately \n20\u03bcm in size, correlating well with the size and shape of the starch granules. Similar findings \n18 \nhave been reported in the literature [11-14]. The microstructure of other specimens made using \nthe same powders composition showed very similar distribution and size of the pores.   \nFigure 9 show the microstructure of a specimen made using 0.45 \u03bcm alumina and 40% vol. \nstarch, at higher magnification. The more advanced stages of the sintering process are more \nevident for this specimen. Neck and grain growth are clearly more developed. The image shown \nin this micrograph suggests that the voids left by the starch particles have partially obstructed \nfurther densification of the ceramic matrix. It was also apparent that this specimen\u201fs \nmicrostructure possessed smaller pores than the 4\u00b5m specimen (Figure 8); essentially reflecting \nits shrinkage rate.  \n \nAs illustrated in Figures 8 and 9, the porous bearings\u201f microstructure consists of solid and voids. \nThe bearing wall becomes permeable at critical porosity \u0444c at which the voids become \ninterconnected [26], allowing fluid flow. In the case of externally pressurised ceramic bearings, \nboth flow through the porous wall and bearing performance [6] are greatly influenced by the \nsupply pressure.  \nIn this study, pore interconnectivity has been examined considering the largest capillary \nequivalent pore obtained via the bubble test (section 3.3) in relation to the specimens\u201f porosity. \nThe presence of the first air bubble indicated pore interconnectivity at a critical porosity. A \npressure of 0.5 MPa was used, which is the minimum pressure at which these bearings are \nexpected to work.  \nFigure 10 illustrates the relationship between open porosity and the maximum equivalent pore. \nIt was observed that the equivalent pore decreases with reduced porosity. The porosity fraction \n19 \nthreshold at which bubbles were observed was 0.31. Below this, no bubbles were observed. The \ndata was best fitted to a power equation, similar to that presented by Larson [26] et al: \n \n         (8) \n \ndmax is the largest capillary equivalent pore, \u0444 is the specimen\u201fs porosity, and \u0444c is the critical \nporosity. It is believed that deviation from theoretical critical exponent value of 2.0 [27] is due \nto the microstructure having a pore network comprising 20 \u03bcm voids left by the starch particles \nand possibly smaller flow interstices resulting from the partial densification achieved during \nsintering. The testing pressure boundary of 0.5 Mpa also limited the scope of the experiment.   \n \n3.4 Permeability measurements \nThe vast majority of the permeability measurements performed occurred in the laminar flow \nregion, indicating little significance of the inertial permeability coefficient. As illustrated in \nFigure 11, the bearing\u201fs viscous permeability coefficient ranged from 1.18 x 10-16 to 1.31 x 10-13 \nm\n2\n. Permeability was observed to vary with the alumina powder size and the starch content.  For \nevery 10% vol. starch increment, permeability increased. The permeability trend-lines for each \nalumina powder size showed an offset in relation to each other, with the larger alumina particle \nsizes showing a higher y-axis intercept. This correlated well with measurements of total porosity \nand pore size. These showed that by increasing the amount of starch in the ceramic slip as well \nas using larger alumina powders results in a higher porosity and larger pore sizes. This \n20 \nconsequently results in a larger number of flow interstices within the porous bearing.  The best \nfit line equations for the permeability trend-lines were of the exponential form: \n \nsa\nv ek            (9) \n \nWhere \u03c8v is the viscous permeability coefficient in m\n2\n, k and a are empirical constants and s is \nstarch volumetric constant (%). The empirically derived constants and the correlation factor R\n2\n \nfor each alumina particle size are summarized in Table 4. The maximum repeatability error \nexperienced was of 0.86 m\n2\n. \nThe obtained permeability range lies well within the optimum operational permeability value of \n1 x 10\n-14\n m\n2 \nfor a 50 mm ID porous hydrostatic journal ultra-precision bearing. This value of \npermeability can be obtained using different combinations of alumina size and starch content \nyielding similar levels of porosity, as illustrated in Table 5.  Subsequent permeability \nmeasurements performed on a larger journal bearing of 80 mm ID, 96 mm OD and 60 mm long \nclosely matched those of the 50 mm ID bearings made with the same slip components, \nconfirming the process consistency. \nIn this work, alumina porous ceramic journal bearings suitable for ultra-precision spindle \napplications were successfully processed using maize starch granules as binder and pore former. \nThe bearings produced were of a hollow cylinder shape and had an internal diameter of 50 mm.  \nThe bearings\u201f total porosity ranged from 19 to 49%. Porosity showed to be first influenced by \nthe alumina powder size. A second influence was the ceramic slip\u201fs starch content, which \nshowed to further increase porosity by as much as 25 %. The increase in porosity resulted in \n21 \nmore, larger pores and this is turn resulted in more permeable structures. For alumina powders \nof 2.1, 2.7, and 4 \u00b5m, the maximum starch vol. content at which bearings exhibited consistent \nporosity and permeability was 40%. All ceramic slips prepared with 7 \u00b5m alumina powders \nwere unsuccessful due to particle segregation. The bearings exhibited average pores ranging \nfrom 1.2 to 3.5\u03bcm. SEM studies conducted on selected specimens revealed the existence of \nlarger pores within the ceramic matrixes microstructure. These were well dispersed and of a \nsemi-spherical shape. The size of these was approximately 20\u03bcm. \nThe bearings produced exhibited well defined, reliable and reproducible permeability values \nranging from 1.18 x 10\n-16\n to 1.04 x 10\n-13\n. Viscous flow was predominantly observed.  The \noptimum permeability value of 1 x 10\n-14\n m\n2 \nfor a 50 mm ID porous hydrostatic journal ultra-\nprecision bearing lies well within this range. Furthermore, the range of permeability obtained \nusing the SC method is wider than previously available and as a result, tailoring of permeability \nand pore size to suit a wider range of ultra-precision applications is now possible.  \nPorous discs of 46 mm diameter and 7 mm thickness were also produced. The porous discs\u201f \ndensity closely matched that of the hollow cylinders. The new method also enabled the \nprocessing of porous ceramic journal bearings of up to 150 mm ID with a typical wall thickness \nof 10mm; which were previously unavailable. These new larger bearings could potentially suit a \nwider range of precision engineering applications.  \nThe new processing method demonstrated to be cost effective, flexible, reproducible and \nenvironmentally sound. Sintering temperatures proved to be sufficiently low to conduct this \noperation using atmospheric furnaces. In addition, no harmful substances have been used or \nproduced. \n22 \nTable 6 shows the performance test results of one of these porous ceramic journal bearings in \ncomparison with a standard 5 recess hydrostatic journal bearing [16]. The porous ceramic \nbearing demonstrated higher stiffness coupled with a more economical performance.  \n \n4 Conclusions \n1. Porous ceramic structures suitable for a variety of ultra-precision applications can be \nsuccessfully produced by the starch consolidation technique. The journal bearings \nproduced with this technique exhibited well defined, reliable and reproducible \npermeability. The optimum permeability of a 50mm ID journal bearing, 1.0 x 10\n-14 \nm\n2\n, \ncan be achieved using the following alumina size-starch vol. % formulations: 2.1\u03bcm-\n32.1%, 2.7\u03bcm-31% and 4\u03bcm-21.4%.   \n2. The total porosity of the bearings ranged from 19 to 49%. Porosity was first influenced \nby the alumina powder size. A second influence was the starch content, which showed to \nfurther increase porosity by as much as 25 %. The increase in porosity resulted in more, \nlarger pores and this is turn resulted in more permeable bearings. \n3. The new processing method demonstrated to be cost effective, flexible, reproducible and \nenvironmentally sound. \n \n23 \nReferences: \n1. J. Corbett, R. J. Almond, D. J. Stephenson, Y. B. P.
