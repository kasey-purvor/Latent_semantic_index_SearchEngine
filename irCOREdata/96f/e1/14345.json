At the time of writing (1995), the university has over 200,000\ndistance learners, of whom more than 100,000 are taking undergraduate courses. The OU\noffers more than 140 undergraduate courses and many other courses in Health and Social\nWelfare, Management, Community Education, etc. There are about 7,700 Tuition and\nCounselling (TAC) staff throughout Europe.\nIndividual members of the TAC staff provide student support as study counsellors and\/or tutors\nfor one or more of the OU's courses, and act as a student's local point of contact with the OU.\nThey are usually contracted to work only part-time for the OU, and many are employed full-\ntime or part-time at another university or educational institution.\nWithin the OU system, there exist only limited opportunities for contact between students and\ntheir tutors. Infrequent tutorial sessions provide the main opportunities for face-to-face\ninteraction between tutors and students, although the telephone enables the discussion of\nproblems and queries. Communication by post forms a vital part of OU studies, with\nassignments being submitted by students for comment and grading by their tutors, who\nsubsequently send back their responses to students.\n35\nAdrian Kirkwood et al Changing role of tutors in distance education with information and communication technologies\nSince 1988 a small number of courses have involved students and tutors in computer-mediated\ncommunication (CMC), and there have also been some small-scale experiments with CMC for\nstudents and tutors located in certain 'remote' areas (Mason, 1995a). However, from 1996\nthere are plans for more widespread access to CMC and other online facilities for those with a\nmodem, etc., and very soon the OU will offer online facilities for administrative purposes.\nAccess to information and communications technologies\nA survey of TAC staff was undertaken in March 1995. Questionnaires were sent to one-third\nof the TAC staff, with full-time OU staff being excluded from the sample. A total of 2,044\nresponses were received (78.5% of the sample). When the data were analysed, differences\nbetween groups (age, gender, type of course tutored, etc.) were examined (Kirkwood et al,\n1995). The survey sought to determine:\n\u2022 the extent of access TAC staff have to information and communications technologies\n(ICTs);\n\u2022 the types of equipment available to them and the location;\n\u2022 their attitudes towards using a computer for their OU work;\n\u2022 in what ways (if any) they had used a computer for their OU work;\n\u2022 their perceived needs for support and training in the use of ICTs.\nThe survey found that, overall, a very large proportion of the TAC staff has access to a\ncomputer, with only 12.3% having no access at all. If, however, we consider those who do not\ntutor courses that require students to use a computer, the proportion without access rises to\n16.0%. The gender differences in both the quantity and quality of access that we have found\nwith successive student surveys (Jones et al, 1992) is repeated in the data for TAC staff, i.e.\nmen have better access than women.\nThe type of computer most frequently used is a PC with Windows, although there are many\nusing other systems, especially Apple Macintosh and Amstrad PCW machines as well as PCs\nwithout Windows. Less than 20% of those with a computer at home have a modem; about the\nsame proportion have a CD-ROM drive. Very many tutors have already used a computer in\nconnection with their OU work, even though only a small number of courses expect tutors to\nuse one.\nMany of the survey respondents felt that the OU should provide support for their use of ICTs\nand not simply in terms of financial assistance to help cover the costs of acquiring hardware or\nperipherals (a modem, CD-ROM drive, etc.) or of online working. A large proportion felt that\nthey should be trained in the use of software appropriate for their OU work.\nIssues for discussion\nWe believe that the results of the survey raise three issues which are particularly important to\nthe OU, but which also have a wider relevance.\nExpected computer literacy and competence\nThe first of these issues is the level of computer literacy and competence that TAC staff will be\n36\nALT-J Volume 4 Number I\nexpected, in future, to have. Currently, TAC staff are selected on the basis of subject expertise\n(i.e. their knowledge and skills related to the subject of the course) and also on their relevant\nteaching expertise (i.e. their experience and skills of tutoring adult students both face-to-face\nand at a distance). Knowledge and skills about using computers are necessary only, and indeed\nrelevant only, when tutors are being considered for courses where these form part of the\ncontent (e.g. computing or information technology). The issue, therefore, is what the effects\nwill be on recruitment and retention Of TAC staff if wider use of computers for OU teaching\nand administration leads to an expectation of access to ICTs and skills in their use. This is of\nparticular concern if the expectation is applied in respect of courses that do not require\nstudents to use computers as well as those that do. Might tutors without such skills find\nthemselves disadvantaged even though they fulfil the criteria in terms of subject and teaching\nexpertise? As has been discussed elsewhere (Kirkup and Jones, 1996), there is the real danger\nthat while opening up new possibilities for some, increased use of ICTs closes down\npossibilities for others - and for TAC staff, as for students, those affected adversely are often\ngroups who are already disadvantaged.\nWho gains most from wider use of ICTs by TAC staff?\nDoes the Open University benefit from the computing knowledge and skills acquired by TAC\nstaff at home or at their main workplace? Do the TAC staff seek to gain experience and skills\nin their use of ICTs for OU activities that can be transferred to their domestic or main work\nsituation?\nCurrently, the OU benefits from the general computing competence and skills possessed by\nTAC staff. However, very many of the tutors with access to a computer feel that they need\ntraining in the use of software and applications, ranging from about 20% wanting training for\nword processing, to more than 50% seeking guidance for email and computer conferencing.\nA survey was recently conducted of tutors for the new (1995) OU course Information\nTechnology and Society (THD204), which requires students and tutors to use a computer for a\nnumber of applications, including CMC and accessing resources on a CD-ROM disc. It found\nthat many hope to increase their IT skills in the process of tutoring the course: 'It appears that\nmany tutors are getting their main training in the use of information and communications\ntechnologies (ICTs) for teaching through their OU work!' (Kirkup etal, 1995, p. 17).\nWithin the wider context of UK higher education, the adoption and use of ICTs for teaching\nand learning may be less well developed than many enthusiasts expect. Research on the\ntransformation of higher education in the UK and the role of ICTs (based upon interviews with\nstaff and students in more than 30 universities and colleges) suggests that with the exception of\nword processing and email (both internally and inter-institutionally) much, if not most, of\nhigher education remains untouched by ICTs (Albury, 1995).\nHow will the tutor's role change with the increased use of ICTs for OU work?\nOU students' overall workload has tended to increase with the introduction of home-based\ncomputing as they learn to use the equipment as well as the subject being studied (Jones et al,\n1992). It is highly likely that TAC staff will experience a similar increase in workload, at least\ninitially.\nCurrently, the workload for OU tutors tends to be intermittent, in that it is greater when\nassignments are due and at the time of group tutorials than at other times. If the use of CMC\n37\nAdrian Kiriwood et ol Changing role of tutors in distance education with information and communication technologies\nwere introduced more widely, tutors would spend time throughout the year working online,\nand the workload would tend to be more continuous. The potential for online working and\nCMC might set up unrealistic student expectations about virtually unlimited levels of contact.\nAs Mason (1995a) has pointed out, increased electronic communication can lead to a particular\nparadox: it offers the potential for providing more learners with up-to-date information (which\ncould reduce teacher resources); however, it also sets up an expectation of fast personal\ninteractive feedback (which requires more teaching resource). Although students currently\nhave open telephone access to their tutors, social conventions have developed to regulate\ncontact time, for example, no telephone conversations at 1.00 a.m. If tutors are to establish\nboundaries of the type that exist in telephone contact, and through that reduce their computer-\nconferencing overload, they need to announce to their students when they will be logging on\n(Mason, 1995b).\nTutors might have to make additional purchases to achieve the required computer\nspecification, and spend more on telephone costs; both of these will have an impact not only on\nthe domestic budget, but also on the use of shared resources. Tutors are therefore likely to\nwelcome methods of reducing the online costs, both in terms of finance and time.\nThere are at least two changes to current practice that could achieve such a cost reduction.\nFirstly, conferencing could be used as a many-to-many delivery system in addition to the more\nfrequently used one-to-many system. Secondly, students could be encouraged to take\nownership of the conferencing. Both these changes, however, would require tutor training in\nconferencing, and would also assume a change in the nature of tutoring such that it would\nbecome a blend of course delivery and course support not previously undertaken by OU tutors.\nOne approach, for example, may be for course teams to provide tutors with structured\nmaterials guiding tutor conferences which include questions to pose to students at intervals\nthroughout the course. Such training would respond to tutors' expressed needs, and would go\nsome way to solving the electronic communication paradox, and also ensuring that the opening\nup of possibilities for some is not done entirely at the risk of disadvantaging others.\nIn conclusion\nAs the OU moves towards greater use of information and communication technologies for\nteaching and student support, the role and the needs of the TAC staff (most of whom work\nonly part-time for the OU) must be re-assessed. The issue is not simply one of ensuring that\nTAC staff have access to appropriate equipment without particular groups being disadvantaged\nor undue additional expense being incurred by all. The University must enable TAC staff to\nmake effective use of technologies appropriate to their teaching and student support activities.\nIn time, ICTs will not simply replace existing means of delivery and communication: they will\nmake possible different forms of educational interaction. In the case of certain courses or\nprogrammes of study, this might involve the generation of new models of distance education,\nin which current distinctions between established patterns of course production, presentation\nand student support become untenable.\nReferences\nAlbury, D.
