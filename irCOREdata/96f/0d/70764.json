Questionnaire data were collected from 623 Hungarian students.

Questionnaire data were collected from 623 Hungarian students. The main factors \naffecting students\u2019 L2 motivation were language learning attitudes and the Ideal L2 self, which \nprovides empirical support for the main construct of the theory of the L2 Motivational Self-\nSystem (D\u00f6rnyei, 2005). Models of motivated behavior varied across the three investigated \nlearner groups. For the secondary school pupils, it was rather interest in English-language \ncultural products that affected their motivated behavior, whereas international posture as an \nimportant predictive variable was only present in the two older age groups.  \n \n \n 3 \n \nSecond and foreign language motivation has been researched in different paradigms and \nnumerous language learning contexts in the past decades (for a recent overview, see D\u00f6rnyei, \n2005). In most projects conducted until recently, researchers usually intended to find out how \none could best describe the L2 motivation of a given group of students (e.g., the attitudinal and \nmotivational dispositions of young Hungarian learners; D\u00f6rnyei, Csiz\u00e9r, & N\u00e9meth, 2006), and \nvalidate and\/or describe the workings and usefulness of a given theoretical concept (e.g., the role \nof integrativeness, see Gardner, 1985, 2001; or, the investigation of self-determination theory, \nNoels, 2001; or attribution theory, Ushioda, 1996; 1998; 2001). Recent work on motivation \ntheory includes the process model of motivation devised by D\u00f6rnyei (D\u00f6rnyei, 2000; 2001a; \nD\u00f6rnyei & Ott\u00f3, 1998), which accounts for the dynamic and temporally changing nature of L2 \nmotivation (for empirical studies see Chambers, 1999; Shoaib & D\u00f6rnyei, in press; Ushioda, \n2001; Williams, Burden & Lanvers, 2002) and D\u00f6rnyei\u2019s (2005) theory of the Motivational \nSelf-System. This theory tries to answer the challenge that the changing world of the 21st \ncentury poses for the Gardnerian concept of integrativeness (Gardner, 1985; 2001), the notion of \nthe native speaker (Widdowson, 1993) and learners\u2019 identification with native speakers (Lamb, \n2004; Yashima, 2000; Warden & Lin, 2000). D\u00f6rnyei\u2019s theory of the Motivational Self-System \nis based on the psychological theory of self-discrepancy (Higgins, 1987) and integrates \nimportant concepts such as learning experiences and intrinsic and extrinsic language learning \ngoals previously identified in the L2 field by Ushioda (2001) and Noels (2003). D\u00f6rnyei\u2019s \ntheory has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of L2 motivation in a wide range \nof learning contexts, but it has not been empirically tested yet. \nMost of the research just cited highlights how learners\u2019 personal histories might change \ntheir views of L2 motivation and their motivated learning behavior, but little attention has been \npaid to the systematic investigation of age-related variations concerning attitudinal and \nmotivational dispositions of language learners within a single language environment. Studies \n 4 \ninvolving non-language major university students are rare (see for example, Masgoret & \nGardner, 2003), and to our knowledge, the motivation of adult language learners has not been \ninvestigated in large-scale quantitative research yet. In many parts of the world, especially in \ncountries where foreign languages were not taught appropriately in school in the 1970s and \n1980s, adults constitute an important language learner population, and most language teachers \nwho work both in the public and private language teaching sectors would attest that adults and \nadolescents require different motivational strategies.  \nThe aim of the investigation presented in this paper is two-fold. Firstly, we explore \npossible differences among three distinct learner groups who study English in a single context, \nBudapest, the capital city of Hungary. Using the same measurement scales, we compare how the \nmotivational and attitudinal dispositions of secondary school pupils, university students and \nadult language learners differ. Second, we also intend to test empirically the two main constructs \nof D\u00f6rnyei\u2019s Motivational Self-System: the Ideal L2 Self and the Ought-to L2 self and explore \nthe relationship of these two key variables with the traditional motivational and attitudinal \ndimensions such as integrativeness and instrumentality.  \nIn the present paper we first provide a theoretical background to our study followed by the \ndescription of the data collection procedures. Next, we describe what latent dimensions emerge \nconcerning the motivational and attitudinal dispositions of learners of various ages and what the \nrelationships among these dimensions are. Finally, we report how and to what extent these latent \ndimensions influence students\u2019 motivated learning behavior in the various age groups.  \n \nReview of literature \n \nThe notion of integrative motivation, which was traditionally a key construct in L2 motivation \nresearch, was introduced by Robert Gardner and Wallace Lambert (1959; 1972). Integrative \nmotivation became a pivotal part of Gardner\u2019s motivation theory, but as Gardner (2001) pointed \n 5 \nout, \u201cit has slightly different meanings to many different individuals\u201d (p. 1). The concept of \nintegrative motivation implies varied psychological and emotional identification either with the \nlanguage community (Gardner, 2001), or if no salient L2 community is present in the immediate \nlearning environment, identification with values associated with the L2 community and the \nlanguage or identification with the language itself (D\u00f6rnyei, 1990). In Gardner\u2019s theory \nintegrative orientation, integrativeness and the integrative motive are differentiated. In \nGardner\u2019s terminology, orientations are the reasons behind learning an L2, more precisely they \n\u201crepresent ultimate goals for achieving the more immediate goal of learning the second \nlanguage\u201d (Gardner, 1985, p.11). Gardner (1985, 2001) defined integrativeness as a latent \nconstruct made up of the following variables: interest in foreign languages, integrative \norientation and attitudes toward the learning situation. The integrative motive is composed of \nattitudinal, goal-directed, and motivational variables. It subsumes integrativeness (as defined \nabove), attitudes toward the learning situation (evaluation of the L2 teacher and course) and \n\u2018motivation\u2019, which is also frequently referred to as motivated learning behavior. According to \nGardner, motivated learning behavior is assumed to be comprised of (a) the desire to learn the \nL2, (b) motivational intensity (or effort), and (c) attitudes towards learning the L2. In other \nstudies the definition of motivated learning behavior might vary slightly, for example, in \nD\u00f6rnyei et al.\u2019s (2006) research, motivated learning behavior was operationalised as a) effort \nand b) the intended choice of learning the given language. In a wide range of projects in a \nvariety of learning environments, integrativeness has been found to be an important variable in \npredicting motivated behavior and ultimately success in language learning (e.g., Cl\u00e9ment, \nD\u00f6rnyei & Noels, 1994; D\u00f6rnyei, 1990; Shaaban & Ghaith, 2000; Wen, 1997). This concept has \noccupied a central role in most models of L2 motivation proposed in the last 40 years (e.g., \nCl\u00e9ment, 1980; D\u00f6rnyei, 1994; MacIntyre, Cl\u00e9ment, D\u00f6rnyei & Noels, 1998; Schumann, 1986).  \n Recently, the Gardnerian construct of integrativeness has come under serious attack. The \nmain reason for problems with integrativeness is that in the 21st century a high number of \n 6 \nstudents learn a second language in a foreign language setting with the purpose of being able to \ncommunicate with other non-native speakers in an international environment. This is especially \ntrue in the case of English, which has become an international language serving as a lingua \nfranca in a globalized world (e.g., Crystal, 2003; Widdowson, 1993). Therefore the English \nlanguage has become separated from its native speakers and their cultures (Skutnabb-Kangas, \n2000). In a recent article, Sifakis (2004) even argued for using the term English as an \nIntercultural Language instead of English as an International Language, which would express \nthat in our days English is most often used in inter-cultural encounters. Integrativeness in the \nsense as defined by Gardner involves the language learners\u2019 identification with native speakers \nof the L2, but for a large number of learners of a variety of languages such as English, German, \nFrench and Spanish, integrativeness has no relevance in today\u2019s world. \nTherefore, it seems to be more appropriate to talk about some kind of cosmopolitan identity or \n\u201cinternational posture\u201d (Yashima, 2002), which includes \u201cinterest in foreign or international \naffairs, willingness to go overseas to study or work, readiness to interact with intercultural \npartners \u2026 and a non-ethnocentric attitude toward different cultures\u201d (ibid, p. 57). The lack of \nidentification with native speakers of English as a significant motivating factor was \ndemonstrated in a number of studies in a variety of settings (e.g., Lamb, 2004; Yashima, 2000; \nWarden & Lin, 2000). It was also shown that in the case of English, it is very difficult to \ndistinguish instrumentality, that is, the utilitarian benefits associated with the knowledge of the \nlanguage, from integrativeness (Kimura, Nakata & Okumura, 2001; Lamb, 2004). As Lamb \n(2004) argued, \u201cmeeting with westerners, using pop-songs, studying and traveling abroad, \npursuing a desirable career \u2013 all these aspirations are associated with each other\u2026\u201d (p. 15). \nTo summarize, motivation research in the 21st century has to face two challenges. First, \nthe traditional concept of integrativeness, as proposed in the work of Gardner (2001), involves \nidentification with the L2 speaking community. In our globalized world, however, there is no \nsalient L2 community to identify with in the case of English; moreover, for a high number of \n 7 \nlearners, especially in a foreign language setting, identification with native speakers does not \nseem to be a relevant motivating factor. Second, as a consequence of English becoming a world \nlanguage, the pragmatic benefits deriving from being able to speak this language and the \nattitudes to the \u201cWord English\u201d community have become intricately linked, which has rendered \nthe separation of integrativeness and instrumentality problematic. In an attempt to answer these \nchallenges, D\u00f6rnyei (2005) and Csiz\u00e9r and D\u00f6rnyei (2005) proposed the model of the L2 \nMotivational Self-System, which consists of three main components: Ideal L2 self, Ought-to L2 \nSelf and L2 Learning Experience. In this model integrativeness is included in the construct of \nthe Ideal L2 Self, which is one\u2019s ideal self-image expressing the wish to become a competent L2 \nspeaker. The Ought-to L2 Self contains \u201cattributes that one believes one ought to possess (i.e. \nvarious duties, obligations, or responsibilities) in order to avoid possible negative outcomes\u201d \n(D\u00f6rnyei, 2005, p. 106). L2 Learning Experience covers \u201csituation-specific motives related to \nthe immediate learning environment and experience\u201d (ibid, p. 106). The model of the L2 \nMotivational Self-System is based on Higgins\u2019 self-discrepancy theory (1987), in which it is \nargued that motivation is the result of someone\u2019s wish to reduce the discrepancy between one\u2019s \nideal self, that is, one\u2019s image of what one would like to become, and one\u2019s actual self, that is, \none\u2019s actual self-state. Motivation also comes about from the intention to lessen the gap between \none\u2019s actual self and one\u2019s ought-to-self, that is, one\u2019s perception of what significant others \nwould like one to become. We should also note that D\u00f6rnyei\u2019s theory is also based on the \nrealization that \u201cone feels like a different person when speaking a second language and often \nindeed acts very differently as well\u201d (Guiora & Acton, 1979, p. 199), which was embodied in \nthe concept of \u201clanguage ego\u201d in Guiora, Beit-Hallahmi, Brannon, Dull and Scovel\u2019s (1972) \nstudy more than 30 years ago. \nIn D\u00f6rnyei\u2019s (2005) model the Ideal L2 Self represents one\u2019s view of oneself as a \ncompetent L2 speaker. Since the closest parallels to the idealized L2 self are the L2 speakers \nthemselves, the Ideal L2 self subsumes integrativeness. D\u00f6rnyei argues that  \n 8 \nour idealized L2-speaking self can be seen as a member of an imagined L2 community \nwhose mental construction is partly based on our real-life experiences of members of the \ncommunity\/communities speaking the particular L2 in question and partly on our \nimagination. (p. 102). \nAs this quote also illustrates, D\u00f6rnyei tried to answer recent challenges to the notion of \nintegrativeness by proposing that instead of an existing native speaker community, students \nregard an imagined cosmopolitan community of international L2 speakers as a group that they \nintend to become a member of. This conceptualization overcomes the problem of the lack of \nclearly identifiable native L2 speaker community and the decreased relevance of identification \nwith L2 speakers for a large group of learners of a variety of languages. \nD\u00f6rnyei\u2019s Ideal L2 Self also includes certain instrumental motives. Gardner (1985) \nconceptualized instrumental motivation as the utilitarian gains associated with the mastery of the \nL2 (better jobs and\/or a higher salary). Noels (2003), however, proposed that perceived benefits \ncan be both intrinsic, that is, internalized by the students, and extrinsic, that is, might be \nregarded as important only by the learners\u2019 environment. Drawing on Noels\u2019 (2003) work, \nD\u00f6rnyei (2005) also argued that internalized instrumental motives are part of the students\u2019 Ideal \nL2-Self, whereas those instrumental values that are \u201cgenerated by a sense of duty or a fear of \npunishment\u201d (p. 103) belong to the Ought-to L2 Self. \nAlthough the importance of self-concept and identification in L2 motivation research \nseems to be evident, D\u00f6rnyei\u2019s (2005) model needs further elaboration and empirical testing. \nFirst of all, as pointed out by Higgins (1999), the attributes of self-discrepancies greatly \ninfluence both emotions and motivation, but in his model D\u00f6rnyei does not discuss how the \nvarious L2 self-concepts might contribute to motivated behavior. It is also debatable whether the \nIdeal L2 Self is able to replace integrativeness, since D\u00f6rnyei\u2019s construct primarily expresses \none\u2019s image of a successful and competent L2 speaker and only indirectly includes attitudes to \nother L2 speakers and an identification element. The relationship of instrumentality and Ought-\n 9 \nto L2 Self is also somewhat ambiguous in the model, as D\u00f6rnyei argued that internalized \ninstrumental motives might be part of the Ideal L2 Self, whereas extrinsic instrumental \nincentives are incorporated into one\u2019s Ought-to L2 self. The question is whether it is possible to \nseparate intrinsic and extrinsic aspects of instrumentality. \nIn our research, we submitted D\u00f6rnyei\u2019s (2005) model of the L2 motivational self-\nsystem to empirical testing on three different populations of learners of English in a foreign \nlanguage setting. First we performed principal component analyses and reliability analyses to \ninvestigate whether the Ideal L2 self, Ought-to L2 self and International Posture can be \nidentified as separate and meaningful constructs in these three groups of Hungarian learners. \nNext we were interested in the relationship of the Ideal L2 self and Ought-to L2 self with key \ntraditional constructs of motivation: integrativeness, instrumentality and motivated behavior. \nFinally, we investigated how the motivational variables predict motivated behavior in the three \nsub-samples.  \n 10 \nMethod \n \nParticipants \n \nOur research is a cross-sectional study that investigated three different cohorts of language \nlearners from Budapest, the capital of Hungary, at a particular point of time. Budapest is the \nlargest city in the country, where one fifth of the total Hungarian population resides. Budapest is \nin many respects similar to major metropolitan cities in Europe, with the exception that in \nHungary most of the population is monolingual: according to the 2000 census, 92.3% of the \nHungarian population claimed to be ethnic Hungarian and the proportion with Hungarian as \ntheir mother tongue was even higher, 98.2% (Central Statistical Office, 2004).  \nWe selected three language learner populations that have not yet been extensively \nstudied in the Hungarian context: secondary school and university students and adult language \nlearners.  In selecting students from these groups we used criterion-sampling. As for secondary \nschool students, we included three schools that fell into the range of institutions with an average \nquality of teaching and average student population based on the rank order of schools in terms \nof the number of students admitted to university (Orsz\u00e1gos K\u00f6zoktat\u00e1si Int\u00e9zet, 2004). Two of \nthe schools were state schools, and in order to represent learners from the private sector of \neducation, we also selected a church-owned school. The three schools were from different \ngeographical locations in the city in order to represent students from various social backgrounds. \nAll the students in the second and third year studying English were asked to fill in the \nquestionnaires. All together 202 learners, 80 male and 122 female, responded to our questions in \nthe secondary school sample. The average age of students was 16.5 years. Studying at least one \nforeign language is compulsory all through primary and secondary education. English is not a \ncompulsory language in Hungarian secondary schools, but it is the most frequently studied \nlanguage (Hal\u00e1sz & Lannert, 2007). When enrolling in secondary school, students can choose \n 11 \nwhich foreign language they would like to study. According to the participants\u2019 self-reports and \ninformation from the students\u2019 teachers, the level of students\u2019 proficiency in the investigated \nsample was between A2 and B1 on the scale of the Common European Framework of Reference \n(CEF) (Council of Europe, 2001). \n In selecting the university students, we paid attention to representing the various fields of \nstudy one can pursue in Budapest and to including learners both from colleges and universities \n(see Table 1). Altogether, 230 learners of English, 92 college students and 138 university \nstudents, responded to our questions. The students\u2019 average age was 21.5 years, and 157 of them \nwere female and 72 male (for two learners gender data were missing). Studying foreign \nlanguages is voluntary at universities, and students are required to pay for foreign language \ninstruction. Students in tertiary education, however, need to hold an intermediate and an \nelementary level language certificate in order to be able to graduate. Therefore, most students in \nthe sample were preparing for one of the accredited intermediate level proficiency exams (B2 \nlevel of the CEF scale). \n Adult language school learners consisted of two main groups: students taking company \ncourses and students enrolled in a language school. 64 of the adult participants attended a \nlanguage course organized by their companies, two of which were private enterprises and one \nwas a state-owned company. In choosing the language schools, eight of the largest language \nschools in Budapest were approached to allow their students to fill in our questionnaires. Five \nschools responded positively to our request, from which 127 students answered our questions. \nThese schools are well-established and high-quality language schools that have won \naccreditation from the Hungarian Chamber of Language Schools. Among the adult participants \n67 were male and 124 female, and their average age was 33.7 years. The participants worked in \nall spheres of life including business, industry, tourism, health care, education and services. \nTheir jobs were widely varied, ranging from housewife to bank manager. According to the \nstudents\u2019 self-reports and their results on the placement test administered by the language \n 12 \nschool, adult language learners\u2019 proficiency ranged from pre-intermediate to advanced levels \n(A2-C1 on the CEF scale). Most of the participants enrolled in the language course voluntarily, \nboth in the language schools and in the company courses.  \n \nMaterials  \nOur questionnaire contained 76 questions for secondary school and university students and 72 \nquestions for adult learners. The questions aimed to measure the most important factors in L2 \nlearning motivation that were identified in previous research, and the instrument included three \nnew variables that have not yet been empirically tested in survey studies: Ideal L2 Self, Ought-\nto L2 Self and International Posture.  \nFor questions 1-20, participants had to indicate on a five-point scale to what extent they \nagree or disagree with statements. These questions intended to cover the following four \nvariables:  \n1. Integrativeness (3 questions): language learners\u2019 attitude to L2 speakers and \ntheir cultures. Example: How much would you like to become similar to the \npeople who speak English? \n2. Instrumentality (4 questions): utilitarian benefits associated with being able to \nspeak the L2 such as higher salary, better jobs. Example: How much do you \nthink knowing English would help your future career? \n3. Cultural interest (4 questions): attitudes to L2 cultural products (films, TV \nprograms, magazines, pop-music). Questions relating to both British and \nAmerican cultural products were asked, as both are widely available for \nHungarian students through various forms of media. Example: How much do \nyou like the films made in the United States? \n 13 \n4. Vitality of the L2 community (4 questions): students\u2019 views concerning the role \nof the USA and UK in today\u2019s world and the wealth of these countries. Example: \nHow important a role do you think the United Kingdom plays in the world? \n \nQuestions 21-69 had to be answered on a five-point Likert-scale where students had to \nmark to what extent the statements characterized them. These questions measured the following \nconstructs: \n5. Linguistic self-confidence (3 questions): students\u2019 views on how easily and \nsuccessfully they will be able to acquire English. Example: I am sure I will be \nable to learn a foreign language well. \n6. Language use anxiety (3 questions): the level of anxiety felt when students use \nEnglish in everyday life. Example: I would feel uneasy speaking English with a \nnative speaker. \n7. Classroom anxiety (3 questions): the level of anxiety felt in language classes. \nExample: It embarrasses me to volunteer answers in our English class. \n8. Milieu (4 questions): the attitude of people in the students\u2019 immediate \nenvironment concerning the importance of learning English. Example: People \naround me tend to think that it is a good thing to know foreign languages. \n9. Parental encouragement (4 questions): the extent to which parents encourage \ntheir children to study English. Example: My parents really encourage me to \nstudy English. This scale was not included in the questionnaire for adults. \n10. Language learning attitudes (4 questions): the extent to which students like \nlearning English. Example: I really enjoy learning English.  \n11. International posture (4 questions): students\u2019 attitudes to English as an \ninternational language. Example: Studying English will help me to understand \npeople from all over the world. \n 14 \n12. Ideal L2 self (7 questions): students\u2019 views of themselves as successful L2 \nspeakers. Example: I like to think of myself as someone who will be able to \nspeak English. \n13. Ought-to L2 Self (6 questions): students\u2019 perceptions of the various language \nlearning related duties and obligations that are set by their immediate \nenvironment. Example: If I fail to learn English I\u2019ll be letting other people down. \n14. Motivated learning behavior (9 questions): students\u2019 efforts and persistence in \nlearning English. Example: I am willing to work hard at learning English. \nIn the last part of the questionnaire, we asked students background questions concerning \nwhat languages they would like to study in the future, when they started learning English, \nwhether they were studying any other foreign language, what their age and gender was, where \nand what they were studying (in the case of university students) and what their job was (in the \ncase of adults). The questions were adapted from two sources: a previous motivation \nquestionnaire used by D\u00f6rnyei and Csiz\u00e9r in a variety of Hungarian research projects (for an \noverview see D\u00f6rnyei et al., 2006) and from a newly developed questionnaire by Ryan (2005).  \n \nProcedures \nThe English version of the questionnaire was first piloted by Ryan (2005). G\u00e1lik (2006) \ntranslated the questionnaire and piloted it by asking two secondary school students to think \naloud while filling it in. Potentially problematic items were reworded, and the instrument was \nadministered to 111 secondary school students (G\u00e1lik, 2006). Following the factor and \nreliability analysis of this pilot run, we omitted or reworded unreliable items.  \nThe final version of the questionnaire was mailed or personally delivered to the secondary \nschools, universities, colleges and language schools, where a person who agreed to take charge \n 15 \nof the administration of the questionnaires distributed them among teachers and collected the \ncompleted questionnaires.  \n All the questionnaires were computer-coded and SPSS (Statistical Package for Social \nSciences) 13.0 was used for analyzing the data. Because the data were normally distributed, we \napplied parametric procedures. The level of significance was set for p < 0.05, and where \nnecessary, we used the Bonferroni correction procedure.  \n \nResults \nThe main dimensions of analysis \n \nIn order to identify broader dimensions underlying the attitudinal\/motivational variables \nmeasured by the questionnaire, we submitted the items belonging to the specific scales to \nprincipal component analysis (conducting separate analyses for each age group). The statistical \ncharacteristics of the various factors in the different sub-samples were similar and sufficient to \nconclude that except for the scale of integrativeness, Hungarian language learners within the \nthree age groups could be described with the same latent dimensions concerning their \nmotivational dispositions. Next, based on the outcome of the principle component analysis, the \nitems were divided into several mult-item scales, and the Cronbach Alpha internal consistency \nreliability coefficients were computed (Table 2).  \nAs the list of variables in Table 3 indicates, some latent dimensions used in earlier \nHungarian studies (e.g. D\u00f6rnyei, Csiz\u00e9r, & N\u00e9meth, 2006) had to be excluded from the analysis \nbecause only two items loaded onto them, and the brevity of these scales did not seem to be \njustifiable. One of these factors was the vitality of different English speaking communities, and \nthe other travel orientation, which emerged as a factor in analyzing the scale that originally \nintended to measure instrumentality. The other factor that could not be adequately described \nwith the items of our questionnaire was linguistic self-confidence. Even though this variable \n 16 \nplayed an important role in previous studies conducted with young schoolchildren in Hungary \n(Cl\u00e9ment et al, 1994; Csiz\u00e9r & D\u00f6rnyei, 2005) and in Canada (Cl\u00e9ment & Kruidenier, 1985), we \nhad to exclude it from the analysis. The reason for this might have been the low number of items \noriginally intended to measure this construct and its partial overlap with language use anxiety. \nWe were surprised to find that in our survey instrumentality could not be adequately identified \nas one single factor. Instrumentality was found to consist of two latent dimensions: knowledge \norientation, that is, learners\u2019 wish to enhance their general knowledge about the world through \nmastering a foreign language, and travel orientation, which expresses the desire to learn English \nfor the purpose of using it when traveling abroad. As just mentioned, this latter factor had to be \nexcluded, due to the fact that only two items out of the originally intended four constituted the \nscale. Another related factor the existence of which was not supported by our data is the Ought-\nto L2 self, as the items supposedly covering the Ought-to L2 self dimension in fact loaded onto \ntwo latent dimensions with some items seemingly belonging to both factors. \nOn the other hand, among the adequate measurement scales we can find the cornerstone of \nD\u00f6rnyei\u2019s (2005) new motivational construct, Ideal L2 self, which emerged as a distinct latent \ndimension, although some items had to be dropped from the scale in order to gain a higher \nreliability coefficient. Three important dimensions that formed an integral part of L2 motivation \nin D\u00f6rnyei et. al\u2019s (2006) study could be identified in our research, namely, integrativeness, \nmilieu and cultural interest. Integrativeness had unexpectedly low reliability for the adult \nsample, and therefore we did not include this scale when analyzing the motivational \ncharacteristics of adults. Additional factors that were hypothesized to play an important role in \nL2 motivation but were not included in previous Hungarian studies, namely Language learning \nattitudes, Classroom and Language use anxiety (e.g., Gardner & MacIntyre, 1993; Gardner, \nTremblay & Masgoret, 1997; Tremblay & Gardner, 1995), Parental encouragement (e.g., \nWilliams & Burden, 1997) and International posture (Yashima, 2002) could be adequately \nmeasured with our instruments and were thus used in further analyses.  \n 17 \n \nComparative analysis of the motivational scales \n \nTable 4 presents descriptive statistics of the scales within the three subsamples and the \ncomparison of three age groups\u2019 scores with the help of a one-way analysis of variance \n(ANOVA). In order to compensate for the effect of multiple testing, the level of significance \nwas set for p < 0.005. \nFor the all three samples, there were two scales, Ideal L2 self and Milieu, that consistently \nshowed the highest mean values (above 4 on a 5-point scale). Similarly, students\u2019 scores on the \nInternational posture scale were also high (around 4), which highlights Hungarian learners\u2019 \npositive attitudes toward the international role of the English language and that they regard the \nknowledge of this language highly useful in today\u2019s globalized world. We can also observe that \nnone of the scales had mean values lower than 3, which indicates that all three groups possess \nfavorable attitudinal and motivational dispositions. As evidenced by the high mean values for \nlanguage learning attitudes and knowledge orientation, the investigated groups of learners think \nthat foreign language learning is important and its process is enjoyable, which is reinforced by \ntheir milieu and, for younger learners, their parents (see the values around 4 on a 5-point scale \nfor milieu and parental encouragement). The descriptive statistics also revealed that on average \nlearners were not particularly anxious about classroom learning and using the language outside \nthe classroom, as the reversed anxiety scales showed values higher than 3. Examining the \nstandard deviation figures, however, we find that the language use anxiety scale showed the \nlargest variation in the study, which indicates that participants experience varying degrees of \nanxiety in L2 communication. The percentage of students suffering from high levels of language \nuse anxiety (values lower than 2) is 10.4% and that of students having negative emotional \nexperiences in the language classroom (values lower than 2) is 5.9%. This indicates that the \n 18 \nanxiety of our participants can be primarily characterized as communication apprehension (for a \nreview of this issue see Horwitz, 2001; MacIntyre, 2002) \nAs for the age-related variations concerning the distinct scales (see Table 4), university \nstudents studying English showed the highest mean values in the case of Ideal L2 self and \ninternational posture, whereas other adults\u2019 and secondary school students\u2019 scores on these \nscales are consistently lower. Additional age-related differences were also reflected in the fact \nthat our criterion measure of students\u2019 motivated learning behavior indicated significant \ndifferences: university and adult language learners showed significantly higher scores on the \nmotivated learning behavior scale, that is, they were willing to invest more effort in language \nlearning, they persisted longer and language learning itself was more important in their lives \nthan in that of the secondary school students.  \n \nThe relationships among the motivational scales \n \nIn order to answer the question of what relationships might describe the obtained motivational \nscales, we carried out correlational analyses. Table 5 presents the significant correlations among \nthe scales within each sub-sample (due to the application of the Bonferroni correction \nprocedure, only correlations where p<.001 are reported).  \nAs can be seen in Table 5, the correlation between the Ideal L2 self and integrativeness \nindicates that the two latent dimensions tap into similar domains but share only 20.34% variance \nfor secondary school students and 12.53% for university students. For these two populations, \nintegrativeness showed a higher correlation with language learning attitudes than with the Ideal \nL2 self, and for university students integrativeness also seemed to be more closely related to \ncultural interest than to the Ideal L2 self. Except for secondary school students, we could also \nsee remarkably high correlations between the Ideal L2 dimension and international posture. The \nrelationship of integrativeness and international posture for secondary school and university \n 19 \nstudents was also strong. International posture as well as the Ideal L2 self and integrativeness \nwere found to be all closely related to the factor called knowledge orientation, which as \ndescribed above was a sub-scale measuring the traditional construct of instrumentality. \n \nThe relationships between the motivational scales and the criterion measure \n \nIn order to find out which attitudinal and motivational scales act as predictor variables of \nstudents\u2019 motivated learning behavior, we carried out multiple regression analyses with a \nstepwise approach. In order to adjust the significance level to multiple testing, the Bonferroni \nprocedure was used, and the level of significance was set for p < 0.01. The results are \nsummarized in Tables 6a-c. For all three samples, the results concerning motivated behavior \nwere consistent and showed only minor age-related variations. Out of the ten dimensions \ninvestigated, four contributed significantly to learners\u2019 motivated behavior: Language learning \nattitudes, Ideal L2 self, Cultural interest and International posture, with Language learning \nattitudes and Ideal L2 self being the most important predictor variables. As regards age-related \ndifferences, the Ideal L2 self was a stronger predictor of motivated behavior of adult learners \ncompared to secondary school and university students. Cultural interest was present as a \nsignificant predictor variable in the secondary school sample, whereas international posture was \nfound to be a contributor only in the university years and adulthood.  \nIn order to further our understanding of the structure of L2 motivation, we also carried \nout regression analyses for the criterion variable of Ideal L2 self. Tables 7a-c indicate that the \nIdeal L2 self was related to different factors in the various age groups. What all three groups of \nstudents had in common is that the best predictor of the Ideal L2 self is international posture. \nFor the Ideal L2 self of secondary school and university students, language learning attitudes \nwas a contributor, but it was not present in the model for adults. In the case of secondary school \n 20 \nstudents as well as adults, the Ideal L2 self was related to the importance students\u2019 milieu \nattaches to language learning. For adults cultural interest also constituted part of the model. \n \nDiscussion \n \nAs the results of the reliability assessments and factor analyses of our questionnaire indicate, \nD\u00f6rnyei\u2019s (2005) theory of the Motivational Self-System only gained partial support. The scale \nmeasuring Ideal L2 self could clearly be identified as a valid and reliable one, whereas the \nexistence of a factor called L2 Ought-to Self could not be ascertained. Related to this, we found \nthat in our questionnaire instrumentality did not emerge as a single dimension either, and only \nthe scale measuring the knowledge orientation facet of instrumentality showed acceptable \nstatistical characteristics. Our results in this respect suggest that for the population we examined, \nthe construct of instrumentality needs to be reconsidered. While some Hungarian studies could \nclearly identify an instrumental dimension for primary school children (e.g., D\u00f6rnyei et al., \n2006), in some other research where participants were secondary school learners no clear \nutilitarian dimension emerged (Cl\u00e9ment et al., 1994; D\u00f6rnyei, 2002; D\u00f6rnyei & Kormos, 2000). \nIn the latter projects, items measuring utilitarian values traditionally attached to the instrumental \ndimension of L2 learning (e.g., obtaining better jobs, higher salary) loaded on a factor with \nvariables measuring other incentives (e.g., traveling, making foreign friends). In their classic \nstudy of motivational orientations, Cl\u00e9ment and Kruidenier (1983) also identified four \norientation dimensions across a number of different learning contexts in Canada; the \ntraditionally conceived instrumental orientation was one of these four, together with travel, \nfriendship and knowledge orientations. It seems that depending on the relative salience of the \nlatter three incentive aspects, these utilitarian values can form different combinations of the \nmeaning of \u2018instrumentality\u2019 for L2 learners. The results of the principal component analysis \nmight also suggest that in countries like Hungary, where the national economy is largely \n 21 \ndependent on foreign companies and international relations, the role of instrumental incentives \nmight be partly covered by international posture since most of the instrumental values of \nknowing English are related to the role of English as an international language.  \nThe key construct of D\u00f6rnyei\u2019s (2005) model, however, was not only found to be a valid \nand reliable factor but also an important dimension of L2 motivation. Among all the components \nof motivation, the Ideal L2 Self scale showed the highest mean values (along with milieu) for all \nthree populations we investigated. This finding indicates that Hungarian learners of English who \nare above the age of 14 and who live in the capital city of Budapest view themselves as \ncompetent foreign language users in the future. The Ideal L2 Self was found to have the highest \nmean value for the university student population. The somewhat lower values for the secondary \nschool students might be explained with reference to the fact that students\u2019 self-image goes \nthrough considerable changes in the period of adolescence (Carlson, 1965), and therefore their \nIdeal L2 Self is also under transformation at this age. On the other hand, adults\u2019 self-image is \nrelatively stable, and because they have to acquire the L2 in adulthood, the L2 self needs to be \nadjusted to their already crystallized self-image. University students are in a period of their lives \nwhen they have a fairly stable self-image, but it is still flexible (Carlson, 1965); therefore the L2 \nself can easily form part of their self-image. The significant differences in students\u2019 future image \nof themselves as competent speakers of English might also be due to the fact that secondary \nschool students experience a limited amount of contact with speakers of English, and thus they \ndo not yet perceive the high importance of being able to use English in the future.  \nWhen we examine the differences in the regression models for motivated behavior, we can \nsee that the models of motivated behavior show considerable variation across age groups. \nAlthough the key predictor variable is the Ideal L2 self for all three groups, for adolescent \nlanguage learners it is rather interest in English-language cultural products that affects their \nmotivated behavior, and international posture as an important predictive variable is only present \nin the two older age groups. It is likely that the above-mentioned age-related difference in the \n 22 \namount of contact with speakers of the target language explains the fact that for adult learners, \nlanguage-related attitudes and Ideal L2 self variables play almost equal roles, explaining around \n40% of the variation in motivated behavior, whereas for the two younger sub-samples, language \nlearning attitudes are slightly more important than the Ideal L2 self. This finding might also be \nexplained with reference to the fact that the language learning attitudes of younger students are \nprimarily based on classroom experience and are largely shaped by teachers (see e.g., Nikolov, \n1999), whereas older students have clear goals with language learning, which are already \nincorporated in their Ideal L2 self and are less dependent on their teacher and classroom \nexperiences. \nIn line with Lamb\u2019s (2004) qualitative study conducted in Indonesia, we also found that \nintegrativeness and the Ideal L2 self are distinct constructs in the Hungarian population \ninvestigated. The correlation of integrativeness and Ideal L2 Self can only be considered \nmoderate for secondary school students, whereas in the sub-sample of university students, it \nfalls in the range generally considered as a weak relationship. Our results, then, indicate that for \nour participants the Ideal L2 self cannot replace the construct of integrativeness, that is, learners\u2019 \nattitudes to L2 speakers as suggested by D\u00f6rnyei (2005). The regression analyses reveal that the \nIdeal L2 self is best predicted by the variable of international posture, and integrativeness is not \npresent in the regression models. From this we might conclude that it is rather one\u2019s attitude to \nEnglish as an international language that affects one\u2019s image as a successful user of L2 in the \nfuture, a finding that is very similar to the one presented in Lamb\u2019s (2004) interview study. If we \nexamine the models of Ideal L2 self, we can see that for secondary students and university \nstudents, attitudes to language learning are among the predictor variables. This suggests that \nenjoyment derived from language learning, an important motivational factor identified by \nUshioda (2001), is related to secondary and university students\u2019 views of themselves as \nsuccessful language users. In D\u00f6rnyei\u2019s (2005) model this motivational factor is assumed to \nbelong to the component of L2 learning experience. Our regression models, however, raise the \n 23 \nquestion of whether it is possible to separate language learning experiences from one\u2019s Ideal L2 \nself. In addition, both the correlational and regression analyses show that there is a strong \nrelationship between adult and secondary school learners\u2019 milieu and their Ideal L2 self, which \nindicates that students\u2019 environment plays an important role in shaping their views of \nthemselves. \nOur study also brings to light inherent problems with the construct of integrativeness. The \nreliability analyses across the three sub-samples show that as students get older, the concept of \nintegrativeness seems to be less consistent for learners: the reliability coefficient for adults is \nunacceptably low. The role of integrativeness in influencing motivated behavior seems to be \ntaken over by the Ideal L2 self. As opposed to earlier studies conducted with Hungarian primary \nschool children (for an overview see D\u00f6rnyei et al., 2006), integrativeness does not even meet \nthe entry criteria. We cannot unequivocally claim either that international posture or \nintegrativeness are interchangeable concepts in the investigated setting, as for secondary \nstudents integrativeness is only moderately strongly related to attitudes to English as an \ninternational language, and it is only for university students that these two scales share 25% of \nthe variance. Due to the fact that secondary school students have a limited amount of contact \nopportunities with users of English outside the classroom and that most coursebooks still focus \non L2 native speakers and their cultures, their attitudes to native speakers and the global English \nuser community show smaller overlaps than that of university students, who might meet foreign \nexchange students and  read international books and journals in English (see Kormos, Csiz\u00e9r, \nMenyh\u00e1rt & T\u00f6r\u00f6k, submitted).  \nIf we examine the models of motivated behavior and the mean values of the scales across \nall three age groups, we can see that the two key dimensions that emerge as important in the \nmotivational profile of the sample investigated are the Ideal L2 self and international posture. \nThis indicates that although D\u00f6rnyei\u2019s (2005) theory of the Motivational Self System needs to \nbe refined, it rightly claims that one\u2019s image as a competent L2 user is a significant driving force \n 24 \nin L2 learning. Our study also lends support to previous investigations that have so far shown, in \nan Asian setting (e.g. Lamb, 2004; Warden & Lin, 2000; Yashima, 2000, 2002), that students\u2019 \nattitudes to the role of English in our globalized world are highly important in L2 learning.  \nThe largest difference between the three age groups can be seen in the case of language \nlearning attitudes and motivated behavior. This might be explained with reference to the \ncompulsory nature of learning English. Although secondary school students might have a choice \nof what language they would like to learn at the onset of their studies, they have to continue \nstudying this language until the end of their secondary school career. For university students, \nthere is also a compulsory factor in language learning, as they cannot receive their diploma until \nthey obtain the prerequisite language certificates. On the other hand, the adult learners surveyed, \nmost of whom attend a language school, might learn English in their free time for their own \npleasure, although they might also experience pressure from the job market to have a high L2 \ncompetence. Nevertheless, we can conclude that despite the fact that the mean values for \nmotivated behavior and language learning attitudes are lower in the case of secondary school \nstudents than in the two older populations, they are still reasonably high. This indicates that all \nthree investigated samples have favorable motivational characteristics as far as learning English \nis concerned. We have to note, however, that this does not necessarily mean that in general \nHungarian learners find learning foreign languages important. Comparative data on the \nmotivational profile of primary school students of English and German indicate that students \nshow considerably more positive attitudes toward and invest more energy in studying English \nthan German, which is also a regionally important language in Hungary (Csiz\u00e9r & Kormos, \nsubmitted). \n \nImplications and directions for future research \nIn this paper we investigated two important issues in the field of L2 motivation: the age-\nrelated differences among Hungarian learners of English in the capital of Hungary and the \n 25 \nvalidity of the two main constructs of D\u00f6rnyei\u2019s Motivational Self-System: the Ideal L2-Self \nand the Ought-to L2 self in a Hungarian context. In our study we found considerable variation in \nthe models of motivated behavior, which suggests that theories of L2 motivation do not only \nhave to take into account the setting in which students acquire the language but also the age of \nthe learners. From this it also follows that it is probably an impossible task to devise a \nuniversally applicable theory of motivation, since, as our research suggests, it is not only the \ncase that a fixed set of factors play a different role in L2 motivation at different ages, but also \nthat certain factors are not even meaningful in a particular setting or for a specific age group.  \nD\u00f6rnyei\u2019s (2005) theory of the Motivational Self-System only gained partial support in our \ncontext since the dimension of Ought-to L2 self could be not be identified. The existence of the \nconstruct of the Ideal L2 self, however, was verified, and the Ideal L2 Self played a highly \nimportant role in language learning motivation for all the investigated age groups. Our results \nalso suggest that the Ideal L2 self is more closely related to international posture than to \nattitudes to native speakers, and that therefore, in a Hungarian context, Ideal L2 self and \nintegrativeness are not interchangeable concepts. \nFrom our results we can conclude that all three investigated samples are highly motivated \nto learn English and have very favorable motivational characteristics. The high willingness of \nstudents to learn the language seems to contrast the actual language competence of the \nHungarian population (TNS Hungary, Press Release, 17 November, 2005), which points to the \nfrequently discussed problems with foreign language teaching in Hungary (e.g. Luk\u00e1cs, 2002). \nOur results indicate that the effort students are willing to invest in language learning is \ndetermined by two important factors: attitudes to language learning and Ideal L2 self. From \nstudies on motivational strategies (D\u00f6rnyei, 2001b), it is evident that teachers, materials and \nactivities are instrumental in shaping attitudes to learning. Therefore, it is highly important for \nall the age groups that teachers employ a wide variety of motivational strategies. The significant \nrole of students\u2019 self-image should also be taken into consideration in the language teaching \n 26 \nprocess. Teachers can ask their students to talk about how they see themselves as language users \nin the future and should explicitly discuss the important role English plays in today\u2019s world. \nBoth of these techniques might have a positive effect on students\u2019 Ideal L2 Self. Our findings \nconcerning the discrepancy of the positive motivational characteristics and the low level of the \nproficiency of students do not only highlight that changes in the overall quality of instruction are \nneeded, but also that positive attitudes and reportedly highly motivated behavior do not \nnecessarily mean that students in fact invest a sufficient amount of energy in language learning. \nLearning an L2 differs from the acquisition of other skills in life in requiring intensive practice \nand increased effort. In a foreign language setting such as Hungary, the number of language \nclasses provided in most instructional programs is not sufficient for becoming a successful L2 \nspeaker if the student does not invest sufficient energy in studying outside the class. \nConsequently, students have to learn how to study on their own and how to exploit the available \nopportunities for using the L2.  Therefore language teaching in Hungary should also involve \ntraining students to become autonomous learners. We also have to note that it is not only the \nresponsibility of schools to help students to learn how to study on their own, but that of parents. \nLanguage teachers should not only show the importance of language learning to their students \nbut should also communicate this to the parents and ask for their support in the teaching process.  \nThe main limitation of our study is that our participants were only from one region of the \ncountry: the capital city, which is thought to be much more cosmopolitan than other settlements \nin Hungary. Therefore, it is expected that certain scales such as English as an international \nlanguage might show different values if other parts of the country were surveyed. One further \npossible extension of our study could be the investigation of language learning motivation in \nsettlements where students experience little contact with English-speakers and their cultural \nproducts. As mentioned above, models of motivation might not only differ across age-groups \nbut in different geographical settings, thus our study could be replicated in different parts of the \nworld, where potentially very different conclusions might be drawn. It is also possible that \n 27 \nreformulation of the items in the scale of Ought-to L2 self might result in the emergence of this \nconstruct as a separate motivational factor. Thus, future studies might not only consider \nchoosing different populations but also extending and modifying the questions of our survey \ninstrument. Another possible direction for future research could be the longitudinal study of the \nmotivational evolution of language learners, which could reveal within one group of students \nhow the interplay of motivational characteristics changes with age and language learning \nexperience and by entering a new language learning environment. \n \n 28 \nAuthor note \n \nJudit Kormos and Kata Csiz\u00e9r \nDepartment of English Applied Linguistics,  \nE\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University, Budapest, Hungary \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe research presented in this article was completed as part of the T047111 project of the \nHungarian Academy of Sciences Research Funds (OTKA).
