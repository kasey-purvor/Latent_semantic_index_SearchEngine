Introduction\nDuring the course of an immune response, antibodies evolve that bind with increased affinity to an anti-\ngen (Jerne, 1951; Eisen & Siskind, 1964). This phenomenon, termed affinity maturation, is based on\nmultiple rounds of somatic hypermutation targeted to the antibody genes and subsequent selection for\nincreased binding affinity (MacLennan et al., 2000). Both the latter processes are in general confined to\ngerminal centres (GCs) (Jacob et al., 1991b). Selection acts on B cells that express as B cell receptor the\nrearranged and possibly mutated antibody gene. Recent experiments suggest that B cells are selected in\na clonal competition, since low-affinity B cells can persist in the GC reaction when competition is re-\nduced (Dal Porto et al., 2002; Shih et al., 2002). Although the key cellular dynamics of the GC reaction\nare by now well-characterised (Liu et al., 1991; Hollowood & Macartney, 1992; MacLennan, 1994), the\nmechanism enabling clonal competition and thus B cell selection has not yet been defined and is the\nsubject of this paper.\nGCs are initially seeded by a small number of proliferating B cells that bind the antigen with at least\nlow affinity (Kroese et al., 1987; Jacob et al., 1991a; Liu et al., 1991). After a phase of B cell expansion,\nsomatic hypermutation is initiated in so-called centroblasts (CBs) which are characterised by a low\n\u2020Email: m.meyer-hermann@fias.uni-frankfurt.de\nc\u00a9 The author 2006.

MEYER-HERMANN ET AL.\nexpression of surface immunoglobulin M (IgM). Upon differentiation into so-called centrocytes (CCs),\nthe IgM expression increases and CCs are selected according to the quality of antigen binding. CCs\nare in a state of activated apoptosis (Liu & Arpin, 1997) and in order to survive, they need to acquire\nantigen and present it to antigen-specific T cells that most probably have entered the GCs together with\nthe antigen-specific B cells (MacLennan et al., 2000; Aydar et al., 2005).\nWhether antigen trapped on follicular dentritic cells (FDCs), as opposed to soluble antigen, is critical\nin the selection process is currently controversial (Aydar et al., 2005; Haberman & Shlomchik, 2003;\nKosco-Vilbois, 2003). Selected CCs differentiate into either memory cells or plasma cells or recycle, i.e.\ndifferentiate back into CBs, which enables them to go through multiple rounds of mutation and selection.\nEarly models of affinity maturation have focused on the selective effect of clonal competition for\nFDC-presented antigen (Siskind & Benacerraf, 1969). This view has been challenged by the recently\nobserved robustness of affinity maturation towards large variation in the amount of initially deposited\nantigen (Vora et al., 1997; Hannum et al., 2000; Manser, 2004). Given that secreted antibodies appear to\nbe dispensable for affinity maturation (Hannum et al., 2000), this robustness is unlikely to derive from a\ncompetition with emerging serum antibodies (Vora et al., 1997; Tarlinton & Smith, 2000; Iber & Maini,\n2002).\nThe alternative model of a clonal competition for binding sites instead of antigen (Kesmir &\nDe Boer 2003) requires affinity maturation to strictly depend on antigen being encountered mem-\nbrane bound, which is the subject of controversy (Haberman & Shlomchik, 2003). Also, antigen\nlocalisation would have to be restricted to a small number of places within the large dendritic network.\nDespite many electron microscopy studies, such localisation restriction has not yet been reported.\nWithout competition for access to antigen or FDCs, higher-affinity B cell clones could be favoured\non the level of antigen binding, either because of differential signalling of B cells in response to different\naffinities of binding (Kouskoff et al., 1998) or because high-affinity B cells require fewer encounters\nwith the FDC to establish an immunological synapse and to extract antigen (Batista et al., 2001; Meyer-\nHermann, 2002a). Here, immunological synapse refers to the supramolecular segregation of proteins\nin lymphoid cell\u2013cell contact zones (Kupfer & Kupfer, 2003), which enable long-term signalling and\neffector functions (Huppa et al., 2003).\nFinally, recruitment of T cell help may be competitive. In vitro assays show that higher-affinity B\ncells are more able to recruit T cell help (Batista & Neuberger, 1998), which may be crucial in the GC\nenvironment, where T cells constitute only 5\u201310% of the GC cell population (Kelsoe, 1996).\nWhile experiments have addressed the various hypotheses, they have not yet succeeded in ruling\nout any of the above mechanisms. This is largely due to the experimental difficulties that are associa-\nted with the investigation of such complex systems. We therefore employed an extended version of a\npreviously described agent-based model for GC reactions (Meyer-Hermann, 2002a; Meyer-Hermann &\nMaini, 2005b), which allowed us to investigate the impact of each factor separately. Model assumptions\nare based on experimental data mostly stemming from lymph nodes of mice or rats and the results are\nrobust against physiologically conceivable variations in the parameter values.\nWe find that both a competition for access to FDCs as well as a competition for antigen (even in\nthe presence of antibodies) does not enable affinity maturation to the experimentally observed degree.\nOn the other hand, both a CC refractory time for interaction with FDCs and competition for T cell help\ncan drive affinity maturation\u2014especially when the acquisition of antigen and survival signals from the\nFDCs is uncompetitive. Given that both selection mechanisms enable affinity maturation over a wide\nrange of antigen densities, even if antigen is encountered in soluble form, we suggest either one or both\nof these to be the physiological mechanism of B cell selection. Experiments are suggested to test this\nunexpected model prediction.\nAN ANALYSIS OF B CELL SELECTION MECHANISMS 257\n2. Model\n2.1 In silico GC simulations\nWe employ in silico simulations of the GC reaction to analyse the B cell selection mechanisms. The\nsimulations are performed using a previously described stochastic hybrid agent-based model (Meyer-\nHermann, 2002a; Meyer-Hermann & Maini, 2005b), which has been extended to test the different se-\nlection mechanisms. The basic idea is to rebuild a GC in silico and to study how its spatial organisation,\ndynamics and output depend on the assumptions that are made about the comprised cells and their\ninteractions. The GC is represented by a lattice whose nodes represent cells. With the exception of pre-\nplasma and memory cells, the GC cells are confined to the area of the GC as defined by the mantle zone.\nThe cell-lattice is supplemented by a second grid for soluble signals. These satisfy reaction\u2013diffusion\nequations which are solved numerically. Given that the analysis of 3D models leads to similar results\n(Meyer-Hermann & Beyer, 2002), we restrict our analysis to 2D in order to gain better statistics because\nof substantially shorter computation times. We include CBs, CCs, FDCs and output cells such as plasma\nand memory cells in all our simulations and study the effect of T helper cells on CC selection in an ad-\nditional set of simulations. The different cell types are encoded in the simulation by defining differently\nsized objects that are associated with distinct sets of rules which reflect their biological properties. The\nrules determine the cellular dynamics by defining motility, cell\u2013cell interactions, cell-cycle times, cel-\nlular lifetimes and similar properties. A comprehensive list of these properties is given below. Despite\nthe complexity of the GC reaction, only a limited set of parameters is required to respect commonly\naccepted GC properties and to capture available quantitative experimental data. Reasonable estimates\ncan be obtained for most of the parameters (Table 1), and the few exceptions are studied in detail. While\nmost of the experimental data stem from lymph nodes of mice or rats, the model applies to all GCs that\nexhibit similar GC morphology and cell dynamics.\n2.2 Antibody representation\nIn order to analyse B cell affinity maturation, we need to define the affinity and thus quality of antibodies.\nAntibodies are represented in a 4D shape space (Perelson & Oster, 1979). According to the principle\nof complementarity, the antigen defines the position of the antibody of maximum affinity to it in the\nshape space. The distance of an arbitrary antibody to this optimal clone is calculated as a one-norm in\nthe shape space (the minimum number of mutations to reach the optimal clone) and is assumed to be a\nmeasure for its affinity to the antigen. The latter is calculated as a Gaussian function with the distance as\nargument and a width of 2.8 mutations. The power and the width of the affinity function are calculated\non the basis of experimental data relating the number of mutations in GC reactions to the increase in\naffinity (for more details, see Meyer-Hermann, 2002a; Meyer-Hermann & Beyer, 2004).\n2.3 Cell motility\nIn agreement with recent two-photon imaging data collected in vivo from mice lymph nodes (Miller\net al., 2002), cells are assumed to perform an undirected and active movement. Unless stated otherwise,\nevery cell is attributed to a single node. All cell states include a mean speed vcell, a polarity \u0002pcell and a\npersistence time \u0001tcell, where \u2018cell\u2019 denotes the different cell types. The probability of displacement of\na cell to a next neighbour node is determined by vcell. The direction of movement is set by \u0002pcell, and the\npolarity changes with a rate according to \u0001tcell. The new polarity is chosen randomly, i.e. without any\nmemory effect. The values of these motility parameters are taken from experiment (Miller et al., 2002)\nand are given in the subsequent list of cell types and in Table 1. However, the two-photon experiment\n258 M.

Note\nthat the actual movement of the cells may be less than expected from vcell when contact inhibition by\nother cells suppresses the movement.\n2.4 Cell types\nThe following list provides a comprehensive description of all cells and their specificities. All parameters\nwithout explicitly given value are of importance for the selection process and are discussed within\nSection 3.\n2.4.1 Follicular dentritic cell. The soma of each FDC is represented as a single lattice node. Each\nFDC is assumed to have four (two per space dimension) dendrites. Every dendrite is attached to the\nsoma and extends to neighbouring nodes. Given that dendrites are flexible, the lattice nodes to which\ndendrites are attributed are not exclusive, i.e. other cells can move onto these nodes. This is not possible\nfor other cell types or the FDC soma. FDCs are assumed to produce a differentiation signal for CBs with\n260 M. E. MEYER-HERMANN ET AL.\na rate rsignal (see below). In order to reduce computational efforts, FDCs are assumed to be immobile.\nThis is a sufficient approximation because the interaction frequency with CCs is dominantly determined\nby the typical distance between FDC-binding sites and CCs. This corresponds to the density of the FDC\nnetwork which is determined by the number of FDCs, NFDC, and the length of the dendrites, dFDC.\nA suitable quantity to measure the density of the FDC network is the number of nodes, XFDC, from\nwhich access to FDC sites is possible in the GC area. We assume access points to be at the position of\nthe dendrites and on all neighbour lattice points. This yields\nXFDC = NFDC 6DdFDC\n\u0001x\n, (1)\nwith D the dimension of the lattice and \u0001x = 10 \u00b5m the resolution of the lattice (chosen as the average\nB cell diameter). The physiological range is 48 \u0001 XFDC \u0001 144; this corresponds to 100 FDCs per GC\n(Kesmir & De Boer, 1999) (NFDC = 4 in the 2D simulation) with a total length of dendrites of each\nFDC 2DdFDC = 40\u2013120 \u00b5m. The FDC number in 2D is calculated by comparing the FDC density of a\nspherical GC in 3D to the FDC density in a GC slice of thickness \u0001x = 10 \u00b5m.\n2.4.2 Centroblasts. CBs are a subpopulation of B cells in the GC. CBs divide with a cycle time of\n6 h (Liu et al., 1991) (i.e. 9 h in 2D) and, owing to somatic hypermutation, acquire in each cell division\nnon-silent mutations with probability 0.5 (Nossal, 1992). Mutations are modelled by a jump to a next\nneighbour in the shape space (in an arbitrary direction); wider jumps are excluded. The transcription\nfactors for susceptibility to apoptosis are already upregulated in CB (Klein et al., 2003). We assume CBs\nnot to be affected by these before they differentiate to CCs. Equally, CBs are assumed not to interact with\nFDCs or T cells, thus neglecting possible rescue mechanisms acting directly on CBs. CBs differentiate\nto CCs at rate rdiff once the local concentration of differentiation signal (which is produced by FDCs and\ndiffuses over the lattice) exceeds a threshold value. Given that neither the exact signal nor its threshold\nconcentration is known, the signal production rate by FDC is given in units of this threshold. Because of\ntheir larger size, we expect CBs to move at a lower mean speed (vCB = 1.5 \u00b5m\/min and \u0001tCB = 2 min)\nthan measured for naive B cells (Miller et al., 2002). Assuming that the mean speed scales according to\nStokes\u2019 friction law, i.e. with the inverse ratio of the radii of CBs and naive B cells, we obtain a realistic\napproximation of real motility properties. This assumption might be wrong in view of observed rather\nmotile large B cells (Gunzer et al., 2004). However, the motility of CBs does not significantly influence\nthe selection mechanisms which are primarily related to the CC motility.\n2.4.3 Centrocytes. CCs differentiate from CBs and neither divide nor mutate. CCs are in an activated\nstate of apoptosis and they have a lifetime of 10 h (Liu et al., 1994), within which they need to receive\na rescue signal to avoid death. Dead CCs are rapidly removed from the lattice assuming a fast clearance\nof apoptotic bodies. The exact nature of the rescue signal depends on the selection mechanism. CCs can\nbe in one of the following states: \u2018unselected\u2019, \u2018in contact with FDC\u2019, \u2018selected by FDC\u2019, \u2018in contact\nwith T cell\u2019, \u2018selected\u2019. Thus, the subpopulation of CCs is rather heterogeneous (Klein et al., 2003).\n\u2018Unselected\u2019 CCs need to find one of the XFDC sites. Once they have access to an FDC site,\nthey try to bind the antigen. The binding probability is proportional to the antibody\u2013antigen affinity.\nUnsuccessful CCs have to wait for 6 min before they can try binding again. This short refractory time\nensures independence of the binding process from the time resolution in the simulations. Note that one\ninvestigated selection mechanism consists of a prolongation of this refractory time (see Section 3). Suc-\ncessful CCs switch to the state \u2018in contact with FDC\u2019 and are rescued from apoptosis. The CC remains\nAN ANALYSIS OF B CELL SELECTION MECHANISMS 261\nbound to the FDC for 2 h (Lindhout et al., 1995). During this time, the rescue signals are thought to be\nprovided by the FDC and the CCs turn into the state \u2018selected by FDC\u2019. Note that the FDCs are assumed\nto provide rescue signals and not to negatively select unsuccessful CCs via, e.g. the FasL\u2013Fas pathway\n(Verbeke et al., 1999).\nAll investigated selection mechanisms act on CCs and define how CCs in the state \u2018selected by\nFDC\u2019 reach the state \u2018selected\u2019. This process is described when the different selection mechanisms are\nintroduced in Section 3.\n\u2018Selected\u2019 CCs further differentiate within 7 h to pre-plasma cells or memory cells (both summarised\nas output cells in the following), or, alternatively, they recycle back to CBs. No data yet exist to relate\nthe relative receptor quality of the CC to its probability of entering either differentiation path. In fact,\navailable experimental data (Han et al., 1995b) can be reproduced by assuming that this probability does\nnot depend on receptor quality (Meyer-Hermann et al., 2001) and as in Meyer-Hermann et al. (2001),\nwe therefore assume that \u2018selected\u2019 CCs recycle with probability 0.8 and differentiate to output cells\nwith probability 0.2.\nCC motility characteristics are assumed to be identical to those of naive B cells (Miller et al., 2002)\nand to be the same in all states, i.e. vCC = 5 \u00b5m\/min and \u0001tCC = 2 min.\n2.4.4 T cells. T cells are only included in one set of simulations in which they are part of the selection\nprocess of CCs. As the relative amount of specific and unspecific T cells is not known, only T cells that\nare specific for the antigen are included, such that all NTC T cells will be able to interact with CCs\nselected by FDC. Consequently, the number of included T cells may underestimate the total number of\nT cells present in the GC. The error introduced by this simplification is restricted to spatial effects of\nT cells, which can be assumed to be small in view of the comparably small total number of T cells in\nGCs. When T cells interact with CCs that have encountered antigen on FDC they develop a polarity\ntowards the CC. If more than one CC selected by FDC simultaneously interact with a T cell, the T cell\nis assumed to polarise towards the CC with highest affinity to the antigen. Without CC the polarity of\nthe T cell is random. The T cell motility characteristics are vTC = 10.8 \u00b5m\/min and \u0001tTC = 2 min\n(Miller et al., 2002).\n2.4.5 Output cells. Pre-plasma cells and memory B cells are collected in a cell pool denoted by\noutput cells. These cells are assumed to have the same motility characteristics as CCs. In contrast to\nCCs, output cells can leave the GC environment when reaching the border of the GC. These cells may\nbe thought of as crossing the mantle zone and entering the marginal zone. The total number of output\ncells produced will be taken as a measure of GC success independent of their presence in the GC at the\nend of the reaction.\n2.5 Diffusion of molecular signals and soluble antibodies\nThe model includes diffusing CB differentiation signals as well as soluble antibodies. The discretised\ndiffusion equation is solved on the lattice with Dirichlet boundary conditions and with constant diffusion\ncoefficient. Note that the diffusion coefficients Ddiff = 200 \u00b5m2\/h and Dab = 2000 \u00b5m2\/h are chosen\nto be very small in order to respect the high cell density in GC that acts as obstacles for free diffusion of\nmolecules. However, the results are robust against different choices of parameter values. Numerically,\nthe Crank\u2013Nicholson and the alternating direction implicit method are used in 2D and 3D, respectively.\nIn one selection mechanism, antigen masking by antibodies is considered. Antibodies, b, are pro-\nduced by output cells at some rate rab, diffuse on the lattice and locally bind to antigen, a, on FDCs to\n262 M. E. MEYER-HERMANN ET AL.\nAN ANALYSIS OF B CELL SELECTION MECHANISMS 263\nform immune complexes, c, according to the rate equation\ndc\ndt\n= k+a(t)b(t) \u2212 k\u2212c(t). (2)\nWhile the affinity of the secreted antibodies will increase during the course of the immune response,\nwe simplified the simulation by using binding rates characteristic of high-affinity antibodies, e.g. k+ =\n106\/(M s) and k\u2212 = 10\u22123\/s (Batista & Neuberger, 1998; Fersht, 1998). This simplification is appro-\npriate as we show that even under such conditions antibody production at a physiological rate does not\nsufficiently increase affinity maturation. The total amount of antigen and antibody is conserved in re-\naction (2), but these will nonetheless not remain constant since free antigen is consumed by CCs that\nbind to FDC, and antibodies are produced by output cells. This equation is solved using a simple Euler\nmethod at every node.\n2.6 Initial conf iguration\nThe GC reaction is seeded by a small number of activated B cells that expand rapidly and fill the GC\nwith about 104 B cells before somatic hypermutation starts (McHeyzer-Williams et al., 1993; Toellner\net al., 2002) and enables the evolution of higher-affinity antibodies. In general, a small number of clones\ndominate the reaction after this expansion. We start the GC simulation after this expansion phase with\n1100 CBs (which correspond to the 104 B cells in 3D) that stem from three different low-affinity clones\n(binding probability 0.04). The antibodies of these clones all have a distance of five mutations to the op-\ntimal clone in the shape space; i.e. they require a minimum of five mutations to gain the optimal affinity.\nHowever, most sequences of mutations will not follow such an optimal antibody affinity evolution path.\nIn fact, we observe about nine mutations in most output cells, which is in agreement with experimental\ndata (Kueppers et al., 1993). The CBs are distributed randomly within the GC. We assume a polarised\nmorphology of the GC in the sense that the FDCs are placed at arbitrary nodes on two-thirds of the\ntotal GC volume (Camacho et al., 1998, Fig. 1C, D). If T cells are included, then they are distributed\nrandomly within the GC. Note, however, that the bias of B cell-flow from dark to light zone induces an\ninhomogeneous T cell distribution which are then concentrated in the outer light zone as observed in\nexperiment (Hardie et al., 1993), without additional assumptions.\n2.7 Simulations and analysis of the results\nIn order to achieve comparability between the different selection mechanisms, two parameters that affect\nCB to CC differentiation were varied within physiological limits, while all other parameters are kept\nconstant throughout all simulations (see Table 1), such that the experimentally determined GC kinetics\nand dark zone duration were reproduced. These two GC characteristics were chosen since both are well\nestablished by experiments and variations of these strongly affect the output of the reaction (Meyer-\nHermann, 2002a).\nFIG. 1.

The hatched area in\n(A,B,C,E,F) indicate the physiological range. The shaded area denotes one standard deviation in 50 simulations.\n264 M. E. MEYER-HERMANN ET AL.\nWe assume the differentiation of CB to CC to be initiated by an FDC-derived signal. A signal for\nCB to CC differentiation has not yet been identified experimentally. However, this mechanism\u2014unlike\nother mechanisms\u2014gives rise to the experimentally observed GC zoning (Meyer-Hermann & Maini,\n2005b), and a realistic GC morphology is important for a realistic investigation of selection mechanisms.\nBeyond the effects stemming from the spatial organisation of the GC, this parameter does not affect B\ncell selection. The differentiation signal production rate per FDC, rsignal, widely determines the duration\nof the dark zone and is adjusted such that the dark zone vanishes between day 8 and 9 (\u223c200 h\u2014full line\nin Fig. 1F, and in panel C in Figs 2\u201311 in the Supplementary Information) after immunisation (Camacho\net al., 1998).\nThe second adjusted parameter, the duration of CB\u2013CC differentiation, \u0001tdiff, governs the total\npopulation dynamics and is chosen such that GC kinetic data (Liu et al., 1991; Hollowood & Macartney,\n1992) are reproduced with sufficient accuracy (Fig. 1D). The deviation \u03b7 from the data is calculated\naccording to\n\u03b7 =\nN\u2211\ni=1\n1\nN \u2212 1\n(xexp(ti ) \u2212 n(ti )\/nmax)2\nxexp(ti )2\n, (3)\nwhere N is the number of experimental values, ti denotes the time in the reaction at which the value\nis taken, n(ti ) is the corresponding volume in the simulation and nmax is the peak population averaged\nover all 50 simulations. We find acceptable GC kinetics when \u03b7 is smaller than 0.3 (Fig. 1E and panel\nB of Figs 2\u201311 in the Supplementary Information). Note that \u0001tdiff must be less than 7 h since CBs are\nfound in the light zone as CCs within 6\u20137 h (Liu et al., 1991). A minimal value is not known.\nThe GC reaction is expected to end after 21 days. Given that the simulation was tuned to reproduce\nthe GC kinetics, the cell number within the GC decreases below 100 cells after 300\u2013400 h for all\nanalysed selection mechanisms (Fig. 1F dotted line and panel C in Figs 2\u201311 in the Supplementary\nInformation). The final cell numbers at day 21 vary for different selection regimes between almost zero\nand less than 100 (see the same figures, dashed dotted lines).\nThere are further characteristics of GC reactions to which the simulation was not fitted, but which\nhad to be reproduced by the simulation in order to ensure the model\u2019s physiological relevance. Thus,\nthe ratio of CCs to CBs at day 12 after immunisation needs to be larger than 2 in order to agree with the\nexperimental observation that CCs greatly outnumber CBs during the GC reaction (MacLennan et al.,\n1990) and the ratio q126 of produced output cells (i.e. pre-plasma and memory B cells) at day 12 to day\n6 after immunisation should be the order of 6 (Han et al., 1995a) (Fig. 1C, and panel D of Figs 2\u201311 in\nthe Supplementary Information). The factor q126 can be interpreted as a measure for the steepness of the\noutput production.\nUnless stated otherwise, all simulations remain in agreement with the aforementioned experimental\nconstraints (compare figures in the Supplementary Information where the full data sets are shown). The\nselection mechanisms that rescue CCs from apoptosis have to rely on some affinity-dependent compe-\ntition between different CCs to achieve affinity maturation. Therefore, the success of a GC reaction is\nmeasured by the affinity of the output cells averaged over all cells produced during the reaction (panel\nB of Figs 1,2,4\u20136, and panel E of Figs 2\u201311 in the Supplementary Information). This quantity is an\nindicator of the entire GC reaction and is not restricted to arbitrary time points of the reaction. The\ntotal number of output cells produced is monitored since a stable population will need to be formed to\nenable robust antibody production. Note that the full data sets are shown only in the case of site com-\npetition. For all other scenarios, we show only the most important data and refer to the Supplementary\nInformation for the full data sets.\nAN ANALYSIS OF B CELL SELECTION MECHANISMS 265\nFIG. 2. A limitation of CC\u2013FDC interaction allows for robust affinity maturation.

Results\n3.1 Competition for binding sites on FDCs\nAccording to the simplest of all suggested models, B cells are selected only in a competition for ac-\ncess to antigen and\/or survival factors that are provided by the FDCs; other potentially limiting factors\nare ignored (Fig. 1A in the Supplementary Information). Accordingly, the number of FDC sites XFDC\n(see (1)) on which antigen is presented would be the limiting factor for which different clones would\ncompete. As described in Section 2, we assume that CCs bind antigen held on FDC with a probability\nproportional to the affinity of the antibody. Given that no further limiting resources are considered in\nthis very simple model, CCs that have been selected by FDCs (e.g. CC selected by FDC in the language\nof the model, see Section 2) do not need any further steps to be positively selected and can follow the\ndifferentiation paths of successfully selected CC.\nBy variation of the site number XFDC, the simulation indeed reveals that affinity maturation is en-\nforced when the number of FDC sites is low (Fig. 1B). Affinity maturation can be observed for a phys-\niological number of FDC sites (48 \u0001 XFDC \u0001 144\u2014see (1)); the extent of the process (less than 50%\nhigh-affinity output cells) is however rather low compared to other selection mechanisms investigated\nhere and not robust to changes in the number of accessible sites.\nThe GC characteristics are reproduced in silico. Thus, the CC to CB ratio at day 12, as well as the\noutput ratio at day 12 to day 6, are in agreement with experimental data for the entire physiological range\n(Fig. 1C). The duration of CB\u2013CC differentiation \u0001tdiff, which decreases from 7 to 1 h with increasing\nsite numbers (Fig. 1A), remains within its expected range for the physiological FDC site numbers. Short\nCB to CC differentiation times had to be employed in order to reproduce the experimentally observed\nGC kinetics because the selection method is not stringent enough to reduce the volume of the GC\nreaction considerably.\n266 M. E. MEYER-HERMANN ET AL.\nFIG. 3. The time course of affinity maturation. The fraction of high-affinity cells (defined as cells with antigen-binding probability\nof more than 0.3) is shown for CBs, CCs, and the accumulated sum of output cells, separately.

In (C) the time course of free and total antigen on FDC, and soluble antibody\nis shown for the same experiment as in (B) but including soluble antibody (taken from Fig. 5). Soluble antibody induces an early\nreduction of free antigen and thereby increases competition for antigen as compared to (B). The shaded area denotes one standard\ndeviation in 50 simulations.\nWe conclude that while B cell competition for access to FDCs can give rise to the observed GC\nkinetics and properties, affinity maturation is relatively poor and not robust against small variations in\nthe number of binding sites.\n3.2 Limiting the interactions with FDCs by introducing a refractory time\nIf CCs can reinitiate binding to FDCs every 6 min (as assumed in our analysis of site competition), then\nthe total number of encounters is considerable during a CC lifetime of 10 h.

We therefore speculate that an increase in the refractory time (\u0001tdelay\u2014the time during\nwhich B cells that failed to bind during a previous contact with a FDC are unable to bind again) will\nincrease the selection pressure (see also Fig. 1B in the Supplementary Information).\n268 M. E. MEYER-HERMANN ET AL.\nFIG. 6. Competition for T cell help allows for robust affinity maturation. In silico GC experiments with 120 FDC sites, abundant\nantigen, and T cells as indicated on the axis (\u0001trescue = 2 h and \u0001tapop = 2.1 h) (see Fig. 8 in the Supplementary Information for\nthe full data set). (A) Parameter adaptation: \u2018duration of CB differentiation\u2019 and differentiation \u2018signal production\u2019 rate per FDC,\n(B) extent of affinity maturation (measured as average binding probability and number of output cells. Combining competition\nfor T cell help with a CC refractory time of 0.5 h and a reduction of the binding probability to 0.5 leads to more robust affinity\nmaturation (squares and diamonds, and Fig. 11 in the Supplementary Information) than in the standard case (circles and triangles).\nIncreasing the refractory time from 6 min to 4 h, we find that a refractory time as low as 0.5 h is\nsufficient to induce affinity maturation of extent similar to that with site competition but for a wide range\nof FDC site numbers. Thus at XFDC = 120 (Fig. 2), when competition for antigen-presenting FDC sites\nis weak, affinity maturation reaches a level previously only seen at low (XFDC = 40) site numbers (com-\npare full lines in Fig. 1B and 2B). A refractory time of 4 h leads to rather efficient affinity maturation\n(60\u201370% of all output cells are of high affinity) while allowing an even better reproduction of the other\nGC characteristics (kinetics, dark zone duration, ratio of CC to CB at day 12 and output ratio at day 12\nto day 6 (Fig. 2 in the Supplementary Information)) than competition for FDC sites (Fig. 1).\nGiven that the binding probability depends on both the affinity-dependent binding probability per\nencounter as well as the number of encounters per CC lifetime, affinity maturation can also be fostered\nby reducing the binding probability per encounter by a certain factor for all affinities. However, the\neffect is smaller than in the case of an increased CC refractory time since such a general reduction in\nthe binding probability also strongly reduces the selection probability for high-affinity clones. These are\nlittle affected by a reduction in the number of encounters since they will bind with high probability on\ntheir first or second trial. A combination of both effects can however reduce the refractory time required\nto gain good affinity maturation to more reasonable physiological values (Fig. 2B dashed line, and\nFig. 3 in the Supplementary Information).\nThe agreement with general GC properties, the efficient affinity maturation, and the robustness to\nvariations in the antigen-presenting FDC site number, make this a candidate mechanism for B cell\nselection in vivo.\n3.3 Competition for antigen presented on FDCs\nIn the two previous scenarios, antigen is presented by FDCs on a limited number of sites where it is\navailable in limitless supply. Instead, it has been proposed that antigen is widely spread but that the total\nAN ANALYSIS OF B CELL SELECTION MECHANISMS 269\namount is limiting such that antigen consumption can drive affinity maturation (Sidman & Unanue,\n1975). Using a sufficiently dense FDC network (XFDC = 120) to avoid site competition, we can study\nthis selection mechanism in silico by homogeneously distributing a number of antigen portions, Nag, on\nall FDC sites and by removing one portion from each site on which CCs have successfully interacted\nwith the FDC (see also Fig. 1C in the Supplementary Information). The binding probability is expected\nto decrease with decreasing amounts of antigen remaining on the FDC sites. As a simple approxi-\nmation, we assume a linear decrease of the CC-binding probability for antigen amounts below some\nthreshold \u0398ag. For larger antigen amounts, the binding probability is constant and solely determined\nby the antibody\u2013antigen affinity. This assumption corresponds to a saturation of the binding probability\nwhen antigen is abundant.\nWhile the selection pressure indeed increases over time as a result of this (Fig. 3B), the extent of\naffinity maturation is rather worse than for site competition alone (compare Fig. 1B for XFDC = 120 and\nFig. 4B). This is due to the initial abundance of antigen and the inferred low selection pressure which in\nturn results in the production of a large number of low-affinity output cells before antigen consumption\ncan increase the selection pressure (compare Fig. 3A and B).\nIf the size of the removed antigen portions per CC\u2013FDC interaction is constant, antigen consumption\nis insufficient to increase the selection pressure in the case of large initial antigen densities (more than\n80 antigen portions per FDC site, compare Figs 1B and 4B); at lower antigen density, antigen is rapidly\nconsumed and the GC reaction declines early, before high-affinity clones are found (Fig. 4, and Fig. 4\nin the Supplementary Information). In the case of antigen consumption proportional to the level of\npresented antigen, a scenario comparable to antigen masking by antibodies arises (see Section 3.4).\nExperiments have revealed a high robustness to variations in the initial antigen density (Vora\net al., 1997; Hannum et al., 2000). If, in the simulation, the antigen threshold to the maximum binding\nprobability \u0398ag is fixed and not scaled with the amount of initially deposited antigen (\u0398ag = Nag), then\nsuch robustness can be observed on a low level (see Figs 5 and 6 in the Supplementary Information).\nIt should be noted that successful affinity maturation at lower antigen densities results from a reduced\nbinding probability for all affinities (as discussed in Section 3.3) such that the observed robustness is the\nresult of two different mechanisms acting in different antigen density ranges.\nWe conclude that in silico antigen consumption does not improve affinity maturation over site com-\npetition alone. At low antigen densities, the general properties of the GC reaction can no longer be\nreproduced. Affinity maturation is therefore unlikely to be driven by antigen consumption even when\ncombined with site competition.\n3.4 The impact of antigen masking by competing antibodies\nPlasma cells outside the GC produce antibodies at rates of up to rab = 2 \u00d7 103 antibody molecules per\nsecond (Randall et al., 1992). These antibodies may mask antigen in the GCs and thereby increase the\nselection pressure on B cells and simultaneously provide a feedback mechanism that enables robustness\ntowards alterations in the initial antigen density (Vora et al., 1997; Tarlinton & Smith, 2000; Iber &\nMaini, 2002) (see also Fig. 1D in the Supplementary Information). Assuming that plasma cells produce\nhigh-affinity antibodies in the GC at a rate of rab = 102 per output cell (thus overestimating a realistic\nproduction of soluble antibody in GCs), we find that the above considerations do indeed hold true: A\nphysiological GC kinetic can be obtained for antigen amounts between 20 and 200 antigen portions per\nFDC site (Fig. 7 in the Supplementary Information). A small improvement in affinity maturation is ob-\nserved relative to site and antigen competition alone (Fig. 5). As before, affinity maturation approaches\nthe site competition value for 120 sites when antigen is abundant (Fig. 5B and 1B).\n270 M. E. MEYER-HERMANN ET AL.\nThe effect of strong antibody production is an early reduction in free antigen, and thus an early\nincrease in the selection pressure (Fig. 3C). For example, in the case of 40 antigen portions per FDC site\n(i.e. for optimal affinity maturation), only 25% of the antigen is used during the GC reaction, but free\nantigen is kept in the limiting regime throughout the reaction (Fig. 3C). In that way the inefficient time\ncourse of affinity maturation found in the case of antigen consumption without soluble antibodies (Fig.\n3B) is restored to some extent.\nWhile antigen masking leads to the correct kinetics and a small improvement of affinity maturation,\nthe number of produced output cells is rather small (Fig. 5B), as is the ratio of CC to CB, and q126 \u0004 6\n(Fig. 5B in the Supplementary Information). We conclude that antigen masking resolves some of the\nproblems in the antigen competition scenario, but some major GC properties are still not reproduced.\nIn addition, this mechanism is not robust to a substantial (10-fold) decrease in the antibody production\nrate, which is more realistic than the rate assumed in the present in silico experiment.\n3.5 Competition for T cell help\nInteractions between antigen-specific CCs and T cells are necessary for CC survival and differentiation\n(de Vinuesa et al., 2000). Given that T cells only constitute 5\u201310% of the GC cell population (Kelsoe,\n1996), this interaction may be competitive. While T cells can bind to several B cells simultaneously, they\ncan only polarise to one (Kupfer et al., 1994), which we assume to be the CC that has previously bound\nantigen with highest affinity (see also Fig. 1E in the Supplementary Information). In our simulation,\npolarisation has to be maintained for a minimum time (\u0001trescue) to rescue a B cell. Cells that bind to\nT cells for longer than \u0001tapop > \u0001trescue and do not receive rescue signals for at least \u0001trescue are doomed\nto apoptosis. Note that all CCs need to be selected by FDCs before they can compete for T cell help.\nWe find that the extent of affinity maturation is only slightly enhanced as compared to site competi-\ntion alone (XFDC = 120 sites), if 5\u201310% of all GC cells are antigen-specific T cells (50\u2013100 T cells per\nGC in the 2D simulation) to which antigen-presenting CCs can bind (Fig. 6B full line). However, given\nthat each antigen-specific T cell only recognises a certain antigen epitope and different CCs will process\nthe antigen differently and therefore present different epitopes, only a small fraction of GC T cells will be\nreactive to a given CC. The simulation reveals that affinity maturation is strongest (60\u201370% of all output\ncells are of high affinity) when only about 0.5\u20131% of all GC cells (5\u201310 T cells per GC in the 2D simula-\ntion) can rescue a given antigen-presenting CC (Fig. 6B full line). The GC characteristics are reproduced\n(Fig. 6A, and Fig. 8 in the Supplementary Information). The mechanism is robust to large variations in\nantigen availability and may still work when antigen is encountered in soluble form since the simulations\nwere performed in a regime where antigen acquisition and interactions with FDCs are uncompetitive.\nThe time span \u0001tapop for which CCs can survive while binding to T cells without receiving rescue\nsignals has a major impact on the level of affinity maturation. Thus a small increase in \u0001tapop from 2.1 to\n4 h already reduces affinity maturation to a level comparable to site competition (see Fig. 9 in the Sup-\nplementary Information). A combination of T cell competition with a general reduction of the binding\nprobability to 50% of its value (see above) has no major effect on the result (see Fig. 10 in Supplemen-\ntary Information). However, a combination of competition for T cell help with a longer CC refractory\ntime makes affinity maturation more robust against changes in the T cell density (Fig. 6B dashed line).\n4. Discussion\nThe simulation results presented here reveal current models of B cell selection (competition for access\nto FDCs or antigen) to be incompatible with available experimental information. We propose two novel\nmechanisms, a refractory time between CC\u2013FDC engagements as well as competition for T cell help.\nAN ANALYSIS OF B CELL SELECTION MECHANISMS 271\nBoth mechanisms enable strong affinity maturation in silico while reproducing all available experimen-\ntal information on GC dynamics. In agreement with experiments (Vora et al., 1997; Hannum et al.,\n2000), the mechanisms are robust to variations in the amount of initially deposited antigen. As com-\npetition for antigen held on FDC is assumed to be non-limiting in both mechanisms, it is likely that\nthese mechanisms also work with soluble antigen which would be in agreement with results from recent\nexperiments that call into question the concept that antigen presentation by FDCs is essential (Hannum\net al., 2000; Haberman & Shlomchik, 2003). However, in the present simulations, an FDC-independent\npreselection of CCs with soluble antigen has not been tested. Note that this in silico simulation is not\nable to cover all possible cellular interactions that might serve as suitable mechanisms for affinity mat-\nuration. Thus, the two highlighted novel mechanisms have to be considered as propositions.\nCompetition for access to FDCs or antigen does not provide a sufficient selection pressure to enable\na high level of affinity maturation in the simulation. While antigen consumption does lead to an increase\nin the selection pressure, this increase comes too late so that many low-affinity output cells have al-\nready been produced and the remaining cell numbers are insufficient for successful affinity maturation.\nMoreover, for low antigen densities, the GC reaction ends prematurely since antigen consumption then\nremoves too much antigen. While antigen masking by emerging antibodies can, in principle, increase\nthe selection pressure earlier, the antibody production rate would need to be unphysiologically high.\nEven then the available data on GCs could not be reproduced and, in addition, affinity maturation is\nnot as strong as that produced by the alternative mechanism. Given that evolution tends to optimise\nperformance, this latter limitation may also be interpreted as an argument against these mechanisms.\nAt first sight, less than 200 output cells (i.e. less than 8000 cells in 3D) may seem low. Given the\nefficient expansion of output cells, the success of an immune response can, however, be expected to\nprimarily depend on the size of the high-affinity fraction; this is therefore a physiologically realistic\nresult. Note that the level of affinity maturation that is achieved in the simulations (60\u201370% of all output\ncells are of high affinity) is in qualitative agreement with the experimentally observed domination of\nhigh-affinity clones (Smith et al., 1997). We had to restrict ourselves to 2D simulations to generate the\nresults with sufficient statistics, which prevent us from a quantitative comparison of this result.\nTo our knowledge, this theoretical investigation is the first systematic comparison of different B\ncell selection mechanisms in GC reactions as well as the first theoretical work to investigate a pos-\nsible role of T cells in the selection process. Previous models have concentrated on single selection\nmechanisms (Iber & Maini, 2002; Meyer-Hermann, 2002a; Meyer-Hermann & Maini, 2005b; Oprea &\nPerelson, 1997; Oprea et al., 2000; Beyer et al., 2002; Kesmir & De Boer, 1999; Meyer-Hermann\net al., 2001) and have, in general, described them only phenomenologically, i.e. without including\ndetails of cell interactions. The impact of the spatial cell distribution has only been investigated in a few\nmodels (Kesmir & De Boer, 2003; Meyer-Hermann, 2002a; Meyer-Hermann & Maini, 2005b; Beyer et\nal., 2002). The present model is based on available GC kinetics and cell motility data (see Section 2) and\nthe parameters have been evaluated carefully using data from mice and rat lymph nodes (see Table 1).\nWe did not find any experimentally uncertain parameter which would change our results qualitatively.\nThe only critical assumption is the shape space concept combined with a smooth affinity function.\nChanges of the width of the function for the affinity-dependent selection probability in the shape space\nhas important consequences for GC development. For small variations of the width, all constraints from\nexperiment can be respected by a corresponding adaption of other parameters. However, this becomes\nimpossible when the width is strongly varied. This shows that our choice for the width is well-defined.\nWhile the suitability of the shape space concept for antigen\u2013antibody affinity may be questioned,\ninsufficient molecular information on antigen\u2013antibody interaction is currently available to allow a more\naccurate model of mutation-dependent increases in antibody\u2013antigen affinity.\n272 M. E. MEYER-HERMANN ET AL.\nAutoreactive B cells have not been considered in the present simulations because under normal\ncircumstances, they are not positively selected by T cells and are therefore eliminated by apoptosis\nsimilar to other antigen-unspecific CCs. We therefore assumed autoreactive B cells to be part of the\npool of low-affinity B cells that emerges from the seeder cells by disadvantageous mutations. This may\nshift the proportion of advantageous and disadvantageous mutations. However, we believe that this\napproximation remains within the error introduced by the shape space concept itself which most likely\nwill inaccurately reproduce this proportion.\nThe CC refractory time and the competition for T cell help are equally attractive selection mecha-\nnisms to explain antibody affinity maturation in GCs and are both likely to play a role in B cell selection.\nThe CC refractory time limits the number of selection trials per CC lifespan such that only high-affinity\nB cells which bind with high probability on the first or second trial are efficiently selected. The CC\nrefractory time will be a consequence of IgM-independent interactions between CCs and FDCs. While\nthe exact duration of such interactions still has to be determined in studies that employ CCs and FDCs,\na refractory time between two CC\u2013FDC encounters as long as 4 h appears to be unlikely. However, we\nhave also shown that an additional general (i.e. affinity independent) reduction of the CC-FDC-binding\nprobability to 0.5 may reduce the necessary refractory time to 15\u201330 min. One may speculate that inte-\ngrin interactions may result in such a refractory time. LFA-1\/ICAM-1 and VLA-4\/VCAM-1 have been\ndescribed to mediate adhesion of B cells to FDCs (Koopman et al., 1991). Even though unspecific con-\ntacts are dissolved in the range of minutes (Gunzer et al., 2004), experiments with lipid bilayers have\nalso shown that especially at low- to medium-affinity, antigen binding may fail to induce the formation\nof an immunological synapse but can still result in a firm integrin-dependent attachment of B cells\n(Carrasco et al., 2004). The speed at which these integrin-dependent contacts form and dissolve if B\ncells fail to establish an immunological synapse (which is generally believed to enable B cell activation\nand antigen extraction, Batista et al., 2001) may determine the refractory time. A different possibility is\na reduced CC motility after an unsuccessful binding event. This might reduce the subsequent interaction\nfrequency of CCs with FDCs.1\nAn additional competition for T cell help further reduces the necessary CC refractory time. It has\nbeen shown in vitro that specific T cell help is essential for affinity maturation in the case of NP\n((4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl)acetyl) (Aydar et al., 2005), and more generally the role of T cells in the\nselection process has been highlighted (de Vinuesa et al., 2000). While their is, as yet, no direct ex-\nperimental evidence for competition for T cell help nor have antigen-specific T helper cells in the GC\nso far been suggested as a limiting factor for affinity maturation, what is known about B cell\u2013T cell\ninteractions strongly supports such a model. Thus, T cells have been observed to interact with sev-\neral B cells at a time but to only activate the B cell towards which the microtubule organising centre\n(MTOC) (and the colocalised Golgi apparatus) is reorganised (Kupfer et al., 1994, 1991; Poo et al.,\n1988). Reorientation of the MTOC is dependent on and directed towards the site of T cell receptor\nsignalling (Sedwick et al., 1991), and, when interacting with several B cells, T cells polarise to the\nB cell with the highest density of specific major histocompatibility complex loaded with specific pep-\ntide (pMMC) (Depoil et al., 2005). We propose that a higher affinity of interaction results in increased\npMHC presentation such that only the highest affinity CC interacting with a T cell is rescued. Such a\ncausal relationship is in agreement with the earlier observations that T cell responsiveness to B cells\ndepends on both the antigen concentration and affinity (Batista & Neuberger, 1998) as well as on the\n(antigen availability dependent) number of MHC class II molecules loaded with antigenic peptide that\nare presented on the B cell surface (Harding & Unanue, 1990; Grakoui et al., 1999). It is not an essential\n1We thank the reviewer for this suggestion.\nAN ANALYSIS OF B CELL SELECTION MECHANISMS 273\nelement of the present model but a plausible hypothesis is that apoptosis is induced in all other B cells\nto which the T cell does not sufficiently polarise. This negative selection by T helper cells could in\nprinciple be mediated by FasL\u2013Fas as interactions which can be expected to form in all contact zones\nindependent of T cell polarisation. Whether FasL is at all upregulated on GC T cells is, however, cur-\nrently unclear since the spatial distribution of FasL in GCs from patients with lymphofollicular hy-\nperplasia correlates with the FDC network rather than with the distribution of CD4-positive T cells\n(Verbeke et al., 1999).\nWhile simultaneous interactions of T cells with several B cells in a lymph node environment have\nbeen reported as transient (Okada et al., 2005), all B cells and T cells used in that study were of the same\nspecificity and T cells rather than B cells were abundant. It will be important to repeat these studies under\nconditions that are more representative of GC reactions and to access the affinity dependence of T cell\u2013\nB cell interactions in far greater detail. Imaging of T cell interactions with B cells that have recognised\nantigen with different affinity should help to clarify whether the MTOC does indeed reorganise to the\nhighest affinity B cell and whether Fas\u2013FasL accumulate in the contact zones to induce apoptosis in the\noutcompeted CC. Moreover, it will be interesting to test whether an (artificial) expansion of antigen-\nspecific GC T cell clones can hamper antibody affinity maturation.\nB cell selection in competition for T cell help challenges the presently held view that FDCs play a\npivotal role in B cell selection. In this novel mechanistic framework, FDCs only play a role in supporting\nfragile CCs with general survival and differentiation signals but do not drive affinity maturation by\nnegatively selecting B cells.\nA competition for T cell help and a long CC refractory time both enable affinity maturation un-\nder conditions when acquisition of FDC signals is uncompetitive such as for a wide range of antigen\nconcentrations. Accordingly, these mechanisms are in agreement with experiments that show that a re-\nduction of antigen densities on FDCs by at least 400-fold does not prevent antibody affinity maturation\n(Hannum et al., 2000).\nWe conclude that within the selection mechanisms tested, thus using a restricted set of possible\ninteraction mechanisms, a combination of T cell competition together with slow CC\u2013FDC interactions\nand a suboptimal binding probability of high-affinity clones can drive B cell selection in GCs under\nthe experimentally established conditions. Further insight into GC dynamics and affinity maturation\nshould be gained by combining the powerful predictions of these agent-based simulations with the latest\nimaging techniques.\nSupplementary data\nSupplementary Figures 1\u201311 can be found at www.imammb.oxfordjournals.org.\nAcknowledgements\nMEM-H was supported by a Marie Curie Intra-European Fellowship within the Sixth EU Framework\nProgram.
