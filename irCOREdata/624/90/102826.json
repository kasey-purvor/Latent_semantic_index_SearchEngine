The carbon plasma initiated from a\ngraphite target by the vacuum arc is sustained during the\ndeposition and macroparticles associated with the arc process\nare filtered using a 90\u00b0 bend toroidal solenoid in the deposi-\ntion system. We have investigated the relationship between\nthe bonding structure in the films and the ion energy of the C\nspecies. At a particular threshold ion energy the particles\nfound in the tetrahedral amorphous carbon ~ta-C! films have\nbeen studied using transmission electron microscopy ~TEM!\nand electron energy loss spectroscopy ~EELS!. Although\nthere are reports that diamond nanocrystallites have been ob-\nserved in diamondlike carbon ~DLC! films deposited under\nlow temperature and low pressure conditions,3\u20136 direct ob-\nservation of diamond crystals in deposition techniques that\ndo not operate at high temperatures and high pressures is not\ncommon. This is because graphite is the stable crystalline\nform of carbon under these conditions.\nHighly tetrahedrally bonded ta-C films have also been\ndeposited using laser initiated vacuum arcs, and pulsed ca-\nthodic arcs,7,8 and hydrogenated ta-C films deposited using a\nplasma beam source.9 There is much interest in all of these\nfilms due to their unique mechanical properties.7,10 Recently,\nYin et al.11 have found cauliflower-like growths ~nanocrys-\ntals! which cannot be indexed to graphite in their FCVA\ndeposited films, which are considered to be precursors for\ndiamond growth.12 However, there has been no published\nliterature on the observation of diamond nanocrystallites in\nta-C films deposited using the FCVA. In this letter, we report\non the observation of nanocrystallites that index to diamond,\na!Electronic mail: s.silva@ee.surrey.ac.ukAppl. Phys.

The substrate bias is varied from 0 to 2120 V,\nwhile the arc current remained constant at ;60 A. A toroidal\nmagnetic field of 40 mT was employed to produce the axial\nand curvilinear fields. The C ions leave the self-sustaining\narc, which is struck between the anode and compressed\ngraphite target, with an average energy centered at 28 eV. A\nPhilips CM30 TEM operated at 100 keV was used together\nwith a Gatan 666 parallel EELS system to analyze the mi-\ncrostructure of the films. A collection angle of 12 mrads was\nused to collect the EELS spectra. The sp3 content was cal-\nculated using the method proposed by Berger et al.13 by ana-\nlyzing the C K edge EELS spectrum. The low loss plasmon\npeak gives the valence electron density which may be used\nto determine the mass density of the ta-C films.14 The density\nmeasured is normalized to that of graphite.\nThe variation of the sp3 fraction and the film density as\na function of ion energy is shown in Fig. 1~a!. A peak in both\nthe sp3 fraction as well as the density is observed at an ion\nenergy of 88 eV. Peaks in the density versus ion energy\ncurve seem to be system dependent for different research\ngroups and have been observed at; 40, 92, 140, and a thresh-\nold value of 50 eV in the results of McKenzie,15 Weiler,9\nFallon,2 and Lifshitz,16 respectively. The films deposited in\nthe current work17 use a similar apparatus to those used by\nMcKenzie15 and Fallon2. The applied magnetic fields influ-\nence the optimum energy window that controls the energy at\nwhich the peak in density occurs. At higher magnetic fields\nmore doubly charged C21 ions will be generated,18 and\nthereby a larger \u2018\u2018thermal spike\u2019\u2019 relaxation process will re-\nsult as these ions will have more energy to dissipate before\nthey come to rest. The doubly charged carbon ions will move\nthe peak in the density and sp3 content to lower ion energy49191\/3\/$10.00 \u00a9 1996 American Institute of Physics\nP\u00aclicense\u00acor\u00accopyright;\u00acsee\u00achttp:\/\/apl.aip.org\/about\/rights_and_permissions\nDownvalues. The ta-C films deposited in this study used a mag-\nnetic field of 40 mT ~sp3 peak at 88 eV!, whereas films\ndeposited19 in an identical FCVA system with magnetic\nfields of 12 and 24 mT gave C sp3 distributions which\npeaked at 130 and 90 eV, respectively. The predicted shift in\nthe peak in the sp3 to lower values is therefore observed.\nRecent results suggest that a higher ion energy due to the\nhigher magnetic fields which modifies the plasma potential\nmay have a more significant effect than the mean charge\nstate of ions in the plasma.20 The observed sp3 fraction of\n;87% at a density of ;3.2 g cm23 is comparable to the best\nresults reported for ta-C films.\nThe peak in the sp3 fraction and density occurring at the\nsame ion energy is expected. The variation of the sp3 frac-\ntion as a function of density for a number of research groups\nis shown in Fig. 1~b!. Assuming that no sp1 states and un-\nsaturated bonds exist, the density of a nonhydrogenated car-\nbon film must lie between those of graphite ~2.25 g cm23)\nand diamond ~3.5 g cm23). Yet, as shown in Fig. 1~b! the\ndata for all the research groups lie above the line joining that\nof diamond and graphite. Cuomo et al.21 used a \u2018\u2018rule of\nmixtures\u2019\u2019 to give a relationship between the sp2\/sp3 bonds\nand density shown by the dashed line in the figure.

The EELS analysis indicates the chemical\ncomposition of the crystallites to be composed entirely of\ncarbon, with a majority of its bonding structure being tetra-\nhedral. Based on the fact that the chemical composition of\nthe nanocrystallites is carbon, together with the diffraction\ndata shown in Fig. 2~b!, it is believed that diamond nanoc-\nrystallites are observed in the ta-C films under certain bias\nconditions.\nIn summary, nanocrystallites having a chemical compo-\nsition of carbon and giving a diffraction pattern that is within\n2% of the published values of cubic diamond are observed in\nroom-temperature deposited tetrahedral amorphous carbon\nusing the filtered cathodic vacuum arc. The nanocrystallites\nmay have formed either within the arc in the plasma phase or\ndue to the kinetic processes involved in the rapid thermal\nquenching of the C1\/C11 ions. It is possible that graphitic\nmacroparticles are necessary for the preseeding of the dia-\nmond nanocrystals as the majority of the crystallites found in\nthe films are graphitic in nature.\n1D. R.
