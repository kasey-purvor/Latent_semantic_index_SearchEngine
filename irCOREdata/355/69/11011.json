From mid\u2010Cretaceous to early Paleocene times the Jurutze and Sumda Formations were deposited within an arc\u2010bounded marine basin between the Dras and Kohistan\u2010Ladakh Island arcs. The <51 Ma aged deltaic Chogdo Formation then filled the basin until deposition of the 50.8\u201349.4 Ma aged Nummulitic Limestone during a marine incursion, before continental facies developed in an evolving intermountain basin with the deposition of the Paleogene Indus Group. Within these systems, sediment was sourced from the Eurasian margin to the north and was transported southward into the suture zone. In this section, we see no unequivocal evidence of Indian Plate input to the sedimentary succession (and thus no evidence of mixed Indian\u2010Eurasian\u2010derived detritus indicative of India\u2010Asia collision) until the upper stratigraphic horizons of the Indus Group, when facies are representative of an axial, northwesterly flowing river system.

From mid\u2010Cretaceous to early Paleocene times the Jurutze and Sumda Formations were deposited within an arc\u2010bounded marine basin between the Dras and Kohistan\u2010Ladakh Island arcs. The <51 Ma aged deltaic Chogdo Formation then filled the basin until deposition of the 50.8\u201349.4 Ma aged Nummulitic Limestone during a marine incursion, before continental facies developed in an evolving intermountain basin with the deposition of the Paleogene Indus Group. Within these systems, sediment was sourced from the Eurasian margin to the north and was transported southward into the suture zone. In this section, we see no unequivocal evidence of Indian Plate input to the sedimentary succession (and thus no evidence of mixed Indian\u2010Eurasian\u2010derived detritus indicative of India\u2010Asia collision) until the upper stratigraphic horizons of the Indus Group, when facies are representative of an axial, northwesterly flowing river system. We suggest that the paleo\u2010Indus River was initiated within the ITSZ during late Oligocene\u2010early Miocene times. Sedimentation of the Indus Group continued until the late Miocene.<\/dc:description><dc:date>\n        2010-12-24<\/dc:date><dc:type>\n        Journal Article<\/dc:type><dc:type>\n        PeerReviewed<\/dc:type><dc:format>\n        application\/pdf<\/dc:format><dc:identifier>\n        http:\/\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\/39868\/1\/2009TC002651.pdf<\/dc:identifier><dc:relation>\n        http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1029\/2009TC002651<\/dc:relation><dc:identifier>\n        Henderson, Alexandra L. and Najman, Yani and Parrish, Randall and BouDagher\u2010Fadel, Marcelle and Barford, Dan and Garzanti, Eduardo and And\u00f2, Sergio (2010) Geology of the Cenozoic Indus Basin sedimentary rocks : paleoenvironmental interpretation of sedimentation from the western Himalaya during the early phases of India-Eurasia collision.

Introduction\n[2] The Cenozoic Indus Basin sedimentary rocks (IBSR),\nalso referred to as the Indus Molasse, Indus Formation,\norKargil Formation [e.g.,Clift et al., 2001a;Frank et al., 1977;\nGansser, 1977; Searle et al., 1990; Shah et al., 1976; Thakur,\n1981; Wu et al., 2007] are a succession of clastic and car-\nbonate sedimentary rocks deposited within the Indus\u2010Tsangpo\nSuture zone (ITSZ) in what previous studies considered\nto be an evolving forearc to intermontane basin setting\nduring the initial and early phases of India\u2010Eurasia conti-\nnental collision.\n[3] The Paleogene depositional age for the well\u2010preserved\nIndus Basin sedimentation [Green et al., 2008; Sinclair and\nJaffey, 2001; van Haver, 1984], conveniently spans the\ncommonly quoted age for initial India\u2010Eurasian collision;\n50\u201355 Ma [e.g., Clift et al., 2002a; de Sigoyer et al., 2000;\nLeech et al., 2005; Powell and Conaghan, 1973; Tonarini\net al., 1993]. It is for this reason that the Indus Basin sed-\nimentary succession holds a record of early Himalayan\nerosion, useful for constraining the timing of India\u2010Eurasia\ncollision (as evidenced by earliest record of mixed Indian and\nAsian detritus, first evidence of Asian detritus deposited on\nthe Indian plate, and timing of cessation of marine facies),\nand reveals insight into the pattern of exhumation of indi-\nvidual geological terranes exposed throughout the Paleogene.\nFurthermore, through facies examination and interpretation,\nit is also possible to obtain an insight into the paleodeposi-\ntional environments which dominated the Indus Basin during\nearly Himalayan evolution. However, the combination of\nintense postdepositional deformation, limited biostratigraphy,\nrapid facies changes, and limited lateral extent of many Indus\nBasin sedimentary formations, has presented great challenges\nfor geologists and has hampered the extent to which strati-\ngraphic work can be used as a precise way of constraining the\ntiming of India\u2010Eurasia collision [e.g., Clift et al., 2002a;\nSearle et al., 1990] and early Himalayan evolution [Clift et al.,\n2001a; Clift et al., 2002a; Garzanti and van Haver, 1988;\nSearle et al., 1990; Sinclair and Jaffey, 2001].\n1Lancaster Environment Centre, University of Lancaster, Lancaster, UK.\n2NERC Isotope Geosciences Laboratory, Kingsley Dunham Centre,\nKeyworth, UK.\n3Department of Earth Sciences, University College London, London, UK.\n4SUERC, Glasgow, UK.\n5Dipartimento di Scienze Geologiche e Geotecnologie, Universita\nMilano\u2010Bicocca, Milan, Italy.\nCopyright 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0278\u20107407\/10\/2009TC002651\nTECTONICS, VOL. 29, TC6015, doi:10.1029\/2009TC002651, 2010\nTC6015 1 of 35\n[4] In order to generate a more detailed understanding\nof early Himalayan evolution from this sedimentary archive,\nthe prime objective of this paper is to create a better defined,\ndetailed stratigraphy obtained from a \u201ctype section\u201d of the\ngeology exposed along the Zanskar River Gorge in northern\nIndia. This is achieved through a combination of detailed geo-\nlogical mapping and geochemical characteristics. Each indi-\nvidual Indus Basin formation is characterized and distinguished\nbased on facies, petrography, and isotopic characteristics.\nWe then use our findings to discuss (1) the paleoenvironmental\nconditions, (2) the origin of detrital sediments, and (3) the\npattern of sediment transport which dominated the early\nphases of India\u2010Eurasian collision. From this we are able to\nproduce a paleotectonic reconstruction for precollisional and\nearly collisional stages of Himalayan evolution, focusing on the\npotential ways by which the IBSR might contribute to our\nunderstanding of the timing of India\u2010Eurasia collision and\nshow evidence for initiation of the paleo\u2010Indus River.\n2. Geology of the Himalaya\n[5] In order to generate an understanding of paleogeo-\ngraphic settings during Indus Basin sedimentation, and the\nprovenance of these rocks, it is necessary to catalog the\ncharacteristics of the main Himalayan geological units as\ndisplayed in Figure 1. These units can be divided into two\ngroups; those comprising the original Eurasian continental\nblock (Lhasa\u2010Karakoram block and Transhimalayan arc)\nand those representing the Indian Plate (Tibetan Sedimen-\ntary Series, High Himalaya, and Lesser Himalaya), sepa-\nrated by the Indus Tsangpo Suture Zone (ITSZ).\n[6] At the most northerly extent of the Himalaya lies the\nLhasa\u2010Karakoram block; consisting of an assemblage of\nigneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rock units, repre-\nsenting the southern margin of the original Eurasian con-\ntinent [e.g., Gaetani, 1997; Le Fort et al., 1994; Rolland\net al., 2002a]. The Karakoram and Lhasa Terranes are\nconsidered to have existed previously as a single tectonic\nunit, now separated by the Karakoram Fault [e.g., Searle\net al., 1988]. To the south of the Karakoram\u2010Lhasa block\nlies the Kohistan Ladakh Island Arc (KLIA), considered to\nhave collided with the southern margin of Eurasia during\nmid to late Cretaceous times [e.g., Clift et al., 2000; Maheo\net al., 2006; Robertson and Degnan, 1994; Rolland et al.,\n2000, 2002b; Sch\u00e4rer et al., 1984b; Searle et al., 1988;\nSutre, 1990; Treloar et al., 1996], creating the Shyok Suture\nZone (SSZ) [Robertson and Collins, 2002].\n[7] Continuing after arc\u2010continent collision, further granitic\nintrusion and volcanism occurred within the now combined\nKLIA\u2010Eurasian margin, along the Transhimalayan Batholith\n(TH); an Andean style granodioritic continental arc, formed\nduring the northward subduction of the Tethyan oceanic\ncrust underneath the Eurasian plate [e.g., All\u00e9gre et al., 1984;\nGarzanti et al., 1987; Honegger et al., 1982]. The lateral\nextensiveness of the Transhimalaya spans the length of the\nHimalayan chain and is characterized by much geochemical\nvariation. Mid\u2010Cretaceous arc volcanism and associated\nplutonic intrusion began at ca. 90\u2013110 Ma [Sch\u00e4rer et al.,\n1984a; Treloar et al., 1989a] with magmatic activity con-\ntinuing into postcollisional times [e.g.,Heuberger et al., 2007].\n[8] Located to the south of the Transhimalaya is the\nIndus\u2010Tsangpo Suture Zone, currently considered to contain\nboth precollisional Cretaceous\u2010Paleocene forearc basin and\npostcollisional Cenozoic intermontane basin sedimentary\nrocks [Garzanti and van Haver, 1988; Searle et al., 1990;\nvan Haver, 1984], all of which were subsequently subjected\nto postcontinental collision polyphase fold\u2010thrust deforma-\ntion with associated anchizonal metamorphism [Garzanti\nand van Haver, 1988; Searle et al., 1988; Treloar et al.,\n1989b]. To the south of the Indus\u2010Tsangpo Suture Zone\nexists the Neoproterozoic\u2010Paleocene Tethyan Sedimentary\nSeries (TSS), representing precollisional sedimentary depo-\nsition on the northern passive margin of India from Permian\ntimes onward [Gaetani and Garzanti, 1991]. A large normal\nfault system of the South Tibet Detachment Zone (STDZ)\nseparates the Tethyan Sedimentary Series from the Higher\nHimalaya (HH) to the south. The Higher Himalayan terrane\nconsists of Indian Plate Proterozoic \u2013 early Paleozoic meta-\nsedimentary rocks and associated magmatic rocks of sim-\nilar and younger (Cambro\u2010Ordovician and Neogene) age\n[DeCelles et al., 2000; Gehrels et al., 2003; Myrow et al.,\n2003; Parrish and Hodges, 1996; Richards et al., 2005].\nBarrovian\u2010style prograde metamorphism affected the Higher\nHimalaya between 37 and 25 Ma [Searle et al., 1992;\nSimpson et al., 2000; Vance and Harris, 1999; Vannay and\nHodges, 1996; Walker et al., 1999] with subsequent\ndecompressive melting and production of leucogranites\nbetween 25 and 12 Ma [Hodges et al., 1996; Le Fort, 1996;\nPrince et al., 1999; Searle et al., 1997b; Simpson et al., 2000;\nVance and Harris, 1999]. Separated from the Higher\nHimalaya by the Main Central Thrust (MCT), the Lesser\nHimalaya (LH) is composed predominantly of low grade to\nunmetamorphosed Indian crustal rocks dominantly of Pre-\ncambrian to Paleozoic age [Frank et al., 1995; Oliver et al.,\n1995; Tewari, 1993; Valdiya, 1980; Valdiya and Bhatia,\n1980]. At the southern frontier of the Himalaya are the\nforeland basin sedimentary rocks of the Subhimalaya; sepa-\nrated from the Lesser Himalaya by theMain Boundary Thrust\n(MBT), and emplaced over the modern\u2010day foreland basin by\nthe blind thrust system of the Main Frontal Thrust (MFT).\n3. Geology of the Indus Basin\nSedimentary Rocks\n[9] The IBSR are located within the Ladakh region\nof northern India and can be traced along a northwest\u2010\nsoutheast trending strike for \u223c2000 km. A summary of\ncurrent published Indus Basin stratigraphies from different\nstudy areas alongside their associated paleodepositional\nenvironments, including the work of this study, are pre-\nsented in Figure 2.\n[10] The oldest units comprise a late Albian\u2010early Eocene\nsequence of dominantly marine, plus a lesser proportion of\ncontinentally deposited, sediments considered to represent\ndeposition within the forearc basin of the Transhimalayan\narc prior to continental collision [Clift et al., 2002a;\nGarzanti and van Haver, 1988; Searle et al., 1990; Sinclair\nand Jaffey, 2001; Steck et al., 1993]. This older sequence\nhas been collectively referred to as the Tar Group [Searle\net al., 1990; Sinclair and Jaffey, 2001], Serie verte de Tar\nHENDERSON ET AL.: GEOLOGY OF THE INDUS BASIN SEDIMENTS TC6015TC6015\n2 of 35\n[van Haver, 1984], or Indus Flysch [Fuchs, 1979, 1981;\nGansser, 1977]. Conformably above the Tar Group, and\nseparated by the Nummulitic Limestone exists a post\u2010early\nEocene sequence of continental sedimentary rocks repre-\nsenting gradual transition from forearc to intermontane basin\ndeposition during the initial stages of continental collision\n[Baud et al., 1982; Garzanti and van Haver, 1988; Sinclair\nand Jaffey, 2001; van Haver, 1984]. These continental\nsediments were first recognized by Tewari [1964] and\nnamed the Indus Molasse or Indus Group [Searle et al.,\n1990; Sinclair and Jaffey, 2001].\n[11] To the north, the upper stratigraphic levels of the\nIndus Group unconformably rest upon granodiorites and\nassociated lavas of the Transhimalaya and Kohistan\u2010Ladakh\nIsland Arc [Gansser, 1977; Garzanti and van Haver, 1988;\nSearle et al., 1997a; Sharma and Gupta, 1983; van Haver,\n1984]. A number of different stratigraphic relationships\nhave been previously proposed to exist at the base of\nthe IBSR. Searle et al. [1990] considered the older IBSR,\nlocated to the south, to disconformably overlie Cretaceous\nvolcaniclastic forearc basin sediments of the Nindam For-\nmation, whereas Clift et al. [2002a, 2000, 2001a] considered\nthe IBSR to overlie Aptian\u2010Albian Cretaceous platform\nlimestone of the Khalsi Flysch, Mesozoic Indian passive\nmargin deepwater sediments of the Lamayuru Group,\nand ophiolitic m\u00e9lange. These contradictory observations\nregarding the IBSR relationship with underlying units most\nlikely result from misidentification of strata, and have been\nclarified in work by A. L. Henderson et al. (Constraints to\nthe timing of India\u2010Eurasia collision: A re\u2010evaluation of\nevidence from the Indus Basin sedimentary rocks, submitted\nto Earth\u2010Science Reviews, 2010).\n[12] The IBSR have been subjected to post depositional\nnortheast\u2010southwest directed compressional deformation\nresulting in the growth of large kilometer\u2010scale folds with\nnorthwest\u2010southeast trending fold axes. Our mapping\n(Figure 3) agrees with Searle et al. [1990] in the recognition\nof a later phase of northwest\u2010southeast directed compres-\nsional deformation. This has resulted in the refolding of the\ninitial folds; developing overturned or recumbent saddle and\nFigure 1.

Small\u2010scale extensional faulting is\nalso observed. We suggest that the intensity of deformation\naffecting the IBSR combined with a paucity of biostrati-\ngraphic data and a lack of stratigraphic younging evidence\npresent in lower stratigraphic levels, has hampered previous\nattempts at accurate stratigraphic reconstructions.\n[13] Fieldwork conducted as part of this project focused\non mapping the geology outcropping along a \u223c15 km\nsection of the Zanskar Gorge between the villages of Nimu\nand Sumda (Figure 3a). The corresponding geological cross\nsection and stratigraphy are presented in Figures 3b and 3c,\nrespectively. When constructing our stratigraphy, we mostly\nused formational names defined within previous publica-\ntions (Figure 2) in order to avoid unnecessary confusion.\n[14] For both the Tar and Indus Groups, we describe in turn\nthe key facies characteristics observed within each formation.\nA summary of the key facies characteristics for each forma-\ntion is presented in Figure 4. Associated stratigraphic logs are\npresented in Figure 5. This is followed by characterization\nof the formations in terms of their petrography, geochemical\nand isotopic characteristics. Finally, paleoflow data collected\nwithin this project are presented alongside previous published\npaleoflow data in Figure 6.\n3.1. Tar Group\n3.1.1. Jurutze Formation\n[15] Identified as the oldest Indus Basin sedimentary unit\nof Late Albian [Garzanti and van Haver, 1988] to earliest\nEocene (section 6.1.2) age, the Jurutze Formation is com-\nposed predominantly of black shales and siltstones, gray\nphyllites, and fine\u2010 to medium\u2010grained black\u2010gray\u2010green\nsandstones, with black limestones occurring toward upper\nstratigraphic levels. Finer\u2010grained lithologies dominate the\nlower stratigraphic levels, with commonly occurring silt,\nlaminated mudstones and fine sandstones often showing\nrhythmic lamination (Figure 7a). Overall the limestones\nbecome thicker and more dominant toward the top of the\nFormation at the expense of other lithologies. Limestone\nbeds are <1 m to several meters thick, absent in macrofossils\nand often contain a large amount of quartz veining. Shales\nare commonly metamorphosed into blue\u2010gray phyllites, and\nsandstones display a partially recrystallized texture. Pyrite is\nabundantly present in the black shales and gray phyllites,\nboth of which are heavily oxidized to a brown\u2010orange color.\nDeformation of the Jurutze is intense, with localized small\u2010\nscale (often tight, chevron) folding and faulting preserved\nthroughout the Formation, making the true thickness of\nthe formation hard to determine. The southerly extent of\nthe exposed Jurutze Formation is not displayed on Figure 3,\nbut can be located \u223c2 km north of Chilling village in the\nZanskar Gorge.\n3.1.2. Sumda Formation\n[16] A continuous conformable sedimentary succession\nexists between the Jurutze and Sumda Formation, with the\nbase of the Sumda Formation marked by the first occurrence\nof fossiliferous limestones (of Ypresian age; section 4,\nFigure 8) within the IBSR stratigraphy. The limestones\nrange from black nummulitic\u2010bioclastic wackestones and\npackstones, to subordinate crystalline carbonates. In addi-\ntion, the Sumda Formation comprises brown\u2010silver\u2010gray,\nthinly laminated phyllites and fine\u2010 to coarse\u2010grained sand-\nstones commonly preserving bifurcating symmetrical rip-\nples. Occasionally associated with the limestones are dm\/cm\nthick beds of brecciated mudstones with carbonate intra-\nclasts. A 30 m logged stratigraphic section representative\nof the middle part of the Sumda Formation is presented\nin Figure 5a. No major folding is visible and beds mainly\ndip subvertically.\n3.1.3. Chogdo Formation\n[17] The relationship between the Sumda and Chogdo\nFormations is conformable with the base of the Chogdo\nFormation defined by the first occurrence of distinct red\u2010\nmaroon\u2010colored well\u2010cleaved shales (Figure 7b). Overall,\nthe Chogdo Formation is composed of a series of fining up\nsedimentary sequences as displayed in Figures 5b and 5c,\ntypically characterized by green gritstones or conglomerates\n(Figure 7c), fining upward into medium\u2010 to fine\u2010grained\ngreen sandstones and maroon shales (Figure 7d) which often\ncontain green calcareous nodules. Sedimentary structures\nare generally absent from the Chogdo Formation except for\noccasional preserved trough cross laminations and scour\nmarks. The Chogdo and overlying Nummulitic Limestone\nand Nurla formations exist in a series of steep\u2010limbed box\nfolds, with main fold hinges trending northwest\u2010southeast\n(Figures 3b and 7e), and as discussed above in section 3,\nthe development of recumbent and\/or overturned saddle and\ncanoe shaped morphologies (Figure 7b).\n3.1.4. Nummulitic Limestone\n[18] Contrary to previous suggestions of a regional\nunconformity [Green et al., 2008; Searle et al., 1990] we\nidentify a conformable contact between the Chogdo and\nNummulitic Limestone formations here (Figures 5d and 7f),\nthe limestone unit dated at latest Ypresian (section 4). The\nFigure 3. (a) Geological map constructed during field seasons in 2007\u20132009 along the Zanskar River Gorge between the\nvillages of Sumda and Nimu. Topographic contours are displayed in 500 m intervals taken from Pointet [2004]. A key to the\nformations is provided which is also applicable to Figure 3b. Regional geography is displayed in the inset map, adapted\nfrom Mah\u00e9o et al. [2004], Robertson [2000], and Honegger et al. [1989] with study area indicated. Locations of strati-\ngraphic logs (Figure 5) are marked (e.g., \u201c5d\u201d). (b) Zanskar Gorge geological cross section between points A, B, and C as\ndisplayed on the geological map in Figure 3a. Approximate locations of villages are displayed, and younging direction\narrows are provided for each formation. We provide no explanation for the change in stratigraphic thicknesses observed in\nsome units and have not invoked structural interpretations to explain these observations where no evidence of such tec-\ntonism was observed in the field.

Thrust fault locations are included.\nHENDERSON ET AL.: GEOLOGY OF THE INDUS BASIN SEDIMENTS TC6015TC6015\n6 of 35\ntransition between the two formations is characterized by\ninterfingering lithologies of clastic and carbonate units over a\ndistance of 10\u201320 m. Occurring \u223c1 m below the base of the\nNummulitic Limestone (defined at the return to carbonate\ndeposition marked by the first crystalline carbonate bed\n(Figure 5d)), in the uppermost section of the Chogdo For-\nmation, exists a pebble conglomerate unit of sedimentary\nlithic clasts held in a well\u2010laminated brown sandy carbonate\nmatrix. The conglomerate fines up into a \u223c25 cm thick well\u2010\nlaminated, dark gray poorly lithified gritty siltstone with\nrandomly distributed sedimentary pebble clasts. A \u223c20 cm\nthick black, well\u2010laminated, crystalline carbonate sits con-\nformably above this shale which marks the base of the\nNummulitic Limestone Formation. Nummulitic\u2010bioclastic\npackstones and black crystalline carbonates dominate the\nlithology of the >300 m thick Nummulitic Limestone For-\nmation. The base of the formation is not particularly fossil-\niferous, being predominantly composed of well\u2010laminated\nblack crystalline carbonates cementing intraclasts of car-\nbonate, clastic grits and sandstones pebbles. Toward the top\nof the formation, limestone gradually become less dominant\nand is interbedded with sandstones, black shales and pebble\nconglomerates; of similar lithology to the Chogdo Forma-\ntion. Sandstones often contain symmetrical bifurcating rip-\nples and black shales show evidence of both planar and\nripple lamination.\n3.2. Indus Group\n3.2.1. Nurla Formation\n[19] The conformable contact between the Nummulitic\nLimestone and Nurla formations is marked by the disap-\npearance of carbonates and return of red shales and dominant\ncoarse green to fine red sandstone, green conglomerates, and\nrare black shales. Despite possessing similar facies to the\nChogdo, the Nurla can be distinguished by being composed\nof overall more proximal, coarser\u2010grained deposits. Sand-\nstones preserve planar and trough cross lamination, burrows,\nplant fossils, and red shale rip up clasts are common within\nlower bedding planes. The red shales have a well\u2010developed\ncleavage and occasional ripple laminations. Overall the Nurla\nFormation shows a fining upward character (see Figure 5e)\nmarked by the increase in thickness and dominance of red\nshales toward the top of the formation. Along the Zanskar\nGorge, the Nurla is faulted to its north against the Choksti\nConglomerate Formation.\n3.2.2. Choksti Formation\n3.2.2.1. Basal Conglomerate Member\n[20] The Basal Conglomerate is faulted against both red\nshales of the Nurla Formation to the southwest, and the Red\nShale Member to the north. This, combined with internal\nfaulting and gentle folding suggests that its measured strati-\ngraphic thickness is a minimum estimate. The formation is\ndominantly clast\u2010supported pebble conglomerates with no\nevidence for clast grading (Figure 5f). Weakly preserved\nsporadic clast imbrication occurs, however these are likely\nmodified by post depositional processes evident by the pres-\nence of pitted pebbles (Figure 7g).

Red Shale Member\n[21] Composed of red shales, and green\u2010yellow fine\u2010 to\nmedium\u2010grained sandstone beds, the Red Shale Member is\nfaulted against the north side of the Basal Conglomerate.\nSandstone beds can be laterally discontinuous and both\nshales and sandstone show abundant ripple lamination,\noccasionally affected by slumping.\n3.2.2.3. Middle Sandstone Member\n[22] The lower portion of this conformable formation\nis exposed around the Choksti Road Bridge where thin\nFigure 5. (continued)\nHENDERSON ET AL.: GEOLOGY OF THE INDUS BASIN SEDIMENTS TC6015TC6015\n11 of 35\n(<30 cm thick, <10 m length) sandstone beds are inter-\nbedded with well\u2010laminated and cleaved semiphyllitic black\nand gray shales (Figures 5g and 7h). These units are closely\nassociated with laterally discontinuous, well\u2010cross bedded\nsandstones (Figure 7) and asymmetrical ripples are com-\nmonly preserved upon sandstone bedding planes. The main\npart of the Middle Sandstone Member (Figure 5h) is very\nsimilar to the Nurla Formation. Sandstones are typically\ngray, green, or yellow, and generally composed of medium\u2010\nsized, poorly sorted, subangular sand grains. Normal grad-\ning is commonly found in the coarser\u2010grained sandstones\nwhich often possess erosive bases and contain black shale\nrip\u2010up clasts. Alongside the dominant black shales, red and\ngreen shales are also common, although they are notably\nFigure 5. (continued)\nHENDERSON ET AL.: GEOLOGY OF THE INDUS BASIN SEDIMENTS TC6015TC6015\n12 of 35\nless abundant than the Chogdo and Nurla formations. Sets of\nfining upward cycles commonly occur on a \u223c10\u201320 m scale,\nwith an overall fining upward nature characteristic of the\nMiddle Choksti Formation. Burrowing and bioturbation is\ncommon within the upper stratigraphic levels alongside the\noccurrence of symmetrical, wavy crested ripples. Sand-\nstones in this upper section become light gray to light green\nin color and show abundant cross bedding.\n3.2.2.4. Upper Sandstone Member\n[23] A gradual transition in facies exists between the\nMiddle to Upper Sandstone members with the continuation\nof fining up sequences of similar scale and lithology, with\nthe contact between the two members marked by a con-\nglomerate bed (notably absent in the Middle Sandstone\nMember). Fining up packages become more distinctive within\nthe Upper Sandstone, with the base of each cycle marked by\na pebble conglomerate and\/or gritstone (Figure 5i), display-\ning erosive bases, and fining up into yellow coarse sand-\nstones possessing infrequent lenticular morphologies. Graded\nbedding and trough cross bedding (displayed on a variety\nof scales) is abundantly apparent within the sandstones. The\ncoarse sandstones progressively evolve up into fine yellow\nsandstones and well\u2010cleaved black\u2010gray and red shales. A\nprogradational trend is observed with fining upward packages\ngradually become more dominant in coarser and thicker\nsandstone beds at the expense of fine\u2010grained facies. The Red\nShale, Middle, and Upper Sandstone members are altogether\nfolded into a series of northeast verging folds. The fold limbs\ntoward the formation\u2019s northern exposure gradually increase\nin steepness, eventually becoming overturned (Figure 7j).\nInternal faulting within the formations is also evident through\na series of small\u2010scale dextral extensional faults, and asso-\nciated folds and shear zones in the lesser resistant units.\n3.2.3. Lower Nimu Formation\n[24] Previous workers [Clift et al., 2002a; Searle et al.,\n1990; Sinclair and Jaffey, 2001] have suggested a faulted\ncontact between the Choksti Formation and the Lower\nNimu. A direct contact between these two units was not\nobserved in the Zanskar Gorge and we were unable to verify\nthis, however an angular discordance in bedding between\nthe two units suggests this contact is not conformable\nFigure 6.

A typical logged stratigraphic section of the\nLower Nimu Formation is presented in Figure 5k. Con-\nglomerates are weathered a distinctive orange\u2010brown color\nand subtly differ from the Basal Conglomerate, with the\ncommon association of red and black shales combined with\nan enriched granitoid clast presence (see section 5.2).\nConglomerate beds with erosive bases are regularly seen to\nbe laterally discontinuous (on a dm scale), terminating in\nFigure 7\nHENDERSON ET AL.: GEOLOGY OF THE INDUS BASIN SEDIMENTS TC6015TC6015\n14 of 35\nsubtly cross bedded subarkosic arenites and finer sediment.\nCoarse\u2010grained sandstone units can display \u223c>40\u201310 m\nwide channelized geometries (Figure 7l) which cut down\ninto underlying, often less resistant units, occasionally\ncomposed of poorly consolidated fine\u2010grained sandstone\nwith an abundance of black shale rip\u2010up clasts (Figure 7m).\nFiner\u2010grained facies include organic rich, ripple laminated\ngray\u2010black shales and fine\u2010grained sandstones, occasionally\npreserving root and plant fossils. Gray\u2010green coarse, angu-\nlar, subimmature sandstones with sporadic cross laminations\n(mm\u2010cm spacing) become more dominant within the middle\nand upper sections of the formation. Horizons of preserved\nplant remains are very common in dark gray sandstones\n(Figure 7n). An abundance of sedimentary structures are\npreserved within the mid to upper levels of the Lower Nimu:\nflute casts (Figure 7o) and tool marks, asymmetric ripple\nlaminations (Figure 7p), normal grading, bioturbation, len-\nticular bedding, neptunian dykes (Figure 7p), and partially\ndeveloped flame structures. The sandstone varies from\nyellow\u2010green\u2010gray\u2010black; possibly controlled by the avail-\nable amount of organic material and diagenetic processes.\nBeds fine upward on a local (\u223csubdecimeter) scale, with\nfiner\u2010grained lithologies ranging from shales to green\u2010gray\nsemiphyllitic slates. Despite this, the Lower Nimu Forma-\ntion overall coarsens upward and contains <100 m thick\ncoarsening upward packages. Similar to some older for-\nmations, the Lower Nimu also shows evidence for a two\nphase compressional deformation history (Figure 7q).\n3.2.4. Upper Nimu Formation\n[25] The Upper Nimu is separated from the Lower Nimu\nby a southwest dipping fault; likely to be a northeast\npropagating thrust (Figure 7r). A series of fault\u2010related folds\nwithin the Upper Nimu, in the footwall of the thrust fault,\nmay be caused by this faulting (Figure 7r). A series of\nFigure 7.

The Upper Nimu Formation is\njuxtaposed against the south side of the Ladakh Batholith\n(Figure 7t), however the contact between these two units is\nnot exposed within the area immediately surrounding Nimu,\nwith the first exposure of the batholith outcropping \u223c5 km\ndue north of the Indus\u2010Zanskar River confluence.\n4. Biostratigraphy\n[26] Previous stratigraphic age estimates of the Indus\nGroup have been hampered by the overall lack of preserved\nfossil assemblages. van Haver [1984] identified palm leaves\nand bivalves within the mid\u2010upper section of the Indus\nGroup to yield an upper Eocene\u2010lower Oligocene age.\nFurthermore, van Haver [1984] also identified Maastrichtian\naged ostracods in the northern Indus Group; however,\nSearle et al. [1990] suggested that these ostracods were\nreworked, thus not reflecting the true depositional age of the\nsediments. The most reliable biostratigraphic age constraints\nwhich can be obtained from the IBSR come from the well\u2010\npreserved fossils within the Tar Group. Limestones from the\nupper Sumda Formation were originally assigned a Paleo-\ncene age by van Haver [1984], based on gastropods and\nbivalves. However, a more recent biostratigraphic study by\nGreen et al. [2008] suggested that the Sumda Formation was\ndeposited during Planktonic Foraminiferal Zone (P) P4c to\nlower P5, allowing the authors to suggest that Sumda\nlimestone deposition terminated during the Upper Paleo-\ncene; 56.5\u201354.9 Ma (in accordance with the time scale of\nBerggren et al. [1995]), marking the end of continuous\nmarine sedimentation within the Indus Basin. Originally the\nNummulitic Limestone Formation was assigned to an early\nmid Eocene age by van Haver [1984] dated at \u223c49 Ma, with\nthe more recent work of Green et al. [2008] proposing a\nCuisian\u2010Ypresian depositional age of 50.5 Ma (equivalent to\nP8, and shallow benthic zone (SBZ) SBZ10; in accordance\nwith the time scale of Berggren et al. [1995]).\n[27] The results of biostratigraphic analysis of four IBSR\nsamples conducted as part of this study are presented in\nFigure 8. Sample ZG07034 from the middle stratigraphic\nlevels of the Sumda Formation (Figures 8 and 9) contains a\nlargely reworked fossil assemblage, disallowing the assign-\nment of a precise depositional age. However, the presence of\nAlveolina rotundata Hottinger (an Early Eocene form, P6\nplanktonic foraminiferal zone\/SBZ8 to SBZ9 shallow benthic\nzones) in sample ZG07034 with the combined presence of\nNummulites atacicus, Nummulites planulatus and Alveolina\nellipsoidalis (Figures 8 and 9) in sample ZG06022 from the\nupper stratigraphic levels of the Sumda Formation imply a\ndepositional age of P6b (SBZ8) at around 54.9 to 51 Ma\n[BouDagher\u2010Fadel, 2008; Gradstein et al., 2004]. Biostrati-\ngraphic analysis of samples ZG07043 and ZG07070 from\nthe Nummulitic Limestone Formation identified the pre-\nsence of Nummulites escheri and Cuvillierina vanbellini\n(Figures 8 and 9) assigning the formation to P8\u2013lower P9\n(SBZ11) with an age range of 50.8 to 49.4 Ma, based on the\ntime scale of Gradstein et al. [2004], marking the age of the\nlast observed marine occurrence in the Indus Suture Zone.\nFurther age constraints, complementary to the biostratigraphic\ndata, are determined from radiometric age dating of detrital\nminerals, as given in section 6.\n5. Composition\n5.1. Sandstone Petrography\n[28] To help characterize the formations and to assess any\nevolutionary compositional changes to the Indus Basin\ndetrital petrography, a total of 14 medium\u2010grained sandstone\nsamples were thin sectioned and analyzed in order to con-\nfirm and expand upon existing data from these forma-\ntions [Garzanti and van Haver, 1988]. For each sample\n>300 orderly spaced points were counted using the Gazzi\u2010\nDickinson method [Dickinson, 1985; Ingersoll et al., 1984],\nenabling proportions of the different minerals present to\nbe established. Full results are displayed in Data Set S1 and\nare presented in a provenance discrimination plot based\non quartz, feldspar, and lithic proportional composition\n[Dickinson and Suczek, 1979] (Figure 10).1 Within all of the\nsamples analyzed, volcanic lithic fragments make up the\ndominant component of total lithic presence. A detailed\naccount of the nature of volcanic lithics present throughout\nthe IBSR stratigraphy is provided by Garzanti and van\nHaver [1988]. Volcanic lithic fragments, predominantly\nfine\u2010grained intermediate volcanics, dominate the total\ncompositional framework in the older IBSR (Tar Group)\nformations. Toward upper stratigraphic levels in the Indus\nGroup, felsic plutonic lithic fragments, quartz and feldspar\nbecome increasingly common at the expense of volcanic\nlithics. Metamorphic lithic fragments of quartzite are present in\nrelatively low abundance in the Lower Nimu (ZG06021) and\nChoksti Formation\u2019s Upper Sandstone Member (ZG06028)\nsamples. The feldspathoquartzose arenites of the Choksti For-\nmation\u2019s Upper Sandstone Member show the first occurrence\nwithin the Indus Group where detrital white micas are pre-\nserved, with the Nimu Formation containing an even greater\nabundance of detrital white micas.\n[29] Heavy mineral analysis was conducted on two sam-\nples from the Nummulitic Limestone and Choksti Forma-\ntion\u2019s Upper Sandstone Member (Data Set S2). Detrital\nbiotite, titanite and blue\u2010green hornblende were present in the\nUpper Sandstone Member, whereas the latter two minerals\nwere absent from the Nummulitic Limestone. These results\nare also reflected in thin section, in agreement with Clift et al.\n[2001a], who found hornblende to only occur in significant\nabundance in post Choksti Basal Conglomerate deposits,\nwith biotite present throughout the section but decreasing\nin abundance upsection. We found diagenetic chlorite and\nepidote present in both our analyzed samples, and we\nacknowledge the strong possibility that true abundances\n1Auxiliary material data sets are available at ftp:\/\/ftp.agu.org\/apend\/tc\/\n2009tc002651.

[2001a, 2002a] our results show that granitoid\nclasts (of all types) occur abundantly throughout the stra-\ntigraphy, but become more dominant toward upper strati-\ngraphic levels. Furthermore, converse to sandstone\npetrography (section 5.1), ophiolite\u2010related clasts (perido-\ntite, serpentinite and m\u00e9lange) are notably more abundant\nwithin lower stratigraphic levels of the Nurla, Nummulitic\nLimestone and Chogdo formations, also in agreement with\nClift et al. [2002a].\n[31] Local variations in clast type and abundance do occur\nwhich are not always documented in the clast counts. In\nparticular the Chogdo Formation is seen to contain gabbro\n(Figure 7c) and the Nurla Formation contains an abundance\nof red volcanic clasts toward the upper stratigraphic limits,\nwhereas the quantity of chert clast abundance varies enor-\nmously throughout the stratigraphy. Carbonate clasts occur-\nring in the Tar Group formations (Chogdo and Nummulitic\nLimestone) are typically black and of a similar lithology to\ncarbonates within the Sumda and Nummulitic Limestone\nformations, and so an autoclastic nature of these clasts is\na possibility. Light gray, muddy carbonate clasts found at\nhigher stratigraphic levels in the Lower Nimu Formation\nappear unlike any carbonates observed in the IBSR units and\nare more likely to represent the first nonautogenic limestone\nclasts within the stratigraphy.\n5.3. Mudstone Geochemistry\n[32] X\u2010ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis was conducted on\nfive Indus Basin mudstone samples to determine the varying\nconcentrations of trace element contribution from ultra-\nmafic\/ophiolitic sources throughout the stratigraphy. Sample\npreparation and XRF analytical procedures closely followed\nthose outlined by Ramsey et al. [1995] and Watson [1996],\nand full XRF results are available in Data Set S3. Trace\nelement results are presented in Figure 12, normalized to the\ntrace element concentrations of Post Archean Australian\nShale (PAAS), compiled by Taylor and McLennan [1985].\n[33] Analysis of an ophioliticm\u00e9langemudstone (ZG07022;\ncollected from \u223c7 km south of our study area, close to the\nvillage of Chilling) contained significant enrichment of trace\nelements Ni, Cr, and Co, and depletion of V and Cu, relative\nFigure 10.

Thus, we consider only Cr, Ni, and Co\nconcentrations as providing a robust means of quantifying\nthe ophiolitic input into the IBSR.\n[34] At the base of the stratigraphy, the Jurutze Formation\ncontains relatively low, depleted Cr and Ni values which\ncontinue to decrease through the stratigraphic succession\nup into the Chogdo. A gradual increase to Ni and Cr con-\ncentrations is observed above the Chogdo Formation and\nthroughout the Indus Group, in agreement with the results\nof Garzanti and van Haver [1988] who interpreted this\nenrichment in the postcollisional units as indicating an uplift\nof ophiolitic\u2010ultramafic rocks immediately after the early\nEocene. The Choksti Formation\u2019s Middle SandstoneMember\n(sample ZG06035) is the only sample to display Cr and Ni\nenrichment relative to PAAS. Relative concentrations of Co\n(compared to concentrations of PAAS) are depleted for the\nlower stratigraphic Formations, except for sample ZG06053\nof the Chogdo Formation which, alongside the Middle\nSandstone Member sample (ZG06035) both show a slight\nrelative enrichment compared to PAAS.\n6.

U\u2010Pb Results\n[36] Histograms displaying the 206Pb\/238U ages of Indus\nBasin samples compared to zircon age characteristics of\nboth Indian and Eurasian plate sources are displayed in\nFigure 13. Mid Cretaceous to early Cenozoic aged detrital\nzircons comprise the dominant age range in the Tar Group\n(Jurutze and Chogdo Formations), ranging from \u223c50 to\n100 Ma. The youngest zircon analyzed within the Jurutze\nprovided an age of 53.4 (\u00b11.4) Ma defining a maximum age\nconstraint to the early phases of IBSR sedimentation;\nyounger than the 60 \u00b1 1Ma age obtained byWu et al. [2007].\nThis younger date is consistent with our re\u2010evaluation\nof biostratigraphic age constraints for the Sumda Formation\n(54.9\u201351 Ma; see section 4). The youngest grain identified\nfrom the upper Chogdo Formation generated an age of 50.8 \u00b1\n1.0 Ma, in agreement with the biostratigraphic ages obtained\nfrom both the overlying Nummulitic Limestone (50.8\u2013\n49.4 Ma; see section 4) and underlying Sumda Formation.\nA total of eight Precambrian aged zircons were found within\nthe Jurutze, Chogdo and overlying Nummulitic Limestone\nformations ranging between 1118 \u00b1 29 Ma and 2581 \u00b1 82 Ma\nbut above this horizon, Precambrian grains are absent.\n[37] A shift in zircon age population is observed in the\nNummulitic Limestone (ZG06062) compared to the TarGroup,\nwith the two dominant age groups occurring at 85\u2013110 Ma\nand 150\u2013160 Ma, and with only three early Cenozoic\u2010late\nCretaceous aged zircons outlying these age ranges, the youn-\ngest of which was 52.5 (\u00b10.7) Ma. The overlying Indus Group\nsamples are all dominated by mid\u2010Cretaceous to mid\u2010Eocene\nages, with the exception of two mid Jurassic aged grains of\n171.0 \u00b1 4.5, 173.3 \u00b1 3.8 Ma occurring in the Nurla Formation\n(ZG06042). The youngest zircon analyzed from the Upper\nNimu (ZG06016) gave an age of 41.3 Ma \u00b1 1.0 Ma, providing\na maximum age constraint to the deposition of the Upper\nIndus Group, complementary to the work of Wu et al. [2007],\nwho obtained a youngest age grain of 41 \u00b1 0.3 Ma.\n6.2. Argon\u201040\u2013Argon\u201039 Dating of White Micas\n6.2.1.

Older formations\nwere unmicaceous or, in the case of the Choksti Formation,\npresent, but with a grain size too small for analysis. In\naddition, white micas from three modern river sand samples,\ndraining the Indian and Asian plates were analyzed in order\nto improve source region characterization. The samples\nwere crushed to gravel and sand sized grains using standard\nrock crushing techniques at Lancaster University. Each\nsample was then sieved into 250\u2013500 mm aliquots from\nwhich the micas were hand picked. They were subsequently\ncleaned ultrasonically in deionized water and 5% HNO3.\nMica grains were then packed in Cu foil packages and\nstacked in quartz tubes. Interdispersed among the Cu packets\nwere Al foil packets containing the International 40Ar\u201039Ar\nAge Standard, Fish Canyon Tuff sanidine (FCs; 28.02 \u00b1\n0.16 Ma, 1s) [Renne et al., 1998] to permit characterization\nof the irradiation flux to the samples. Samples were irradiated\nfor 12 h in the McMaster reactor, Ontario, Canada. Laser\nfusion of single mica grains was used to extract the Ar. We\nused a 25W Merchantek CO2 laser. A 3% power step was\nused to degas surface contaminants (e.g., atmospheric 40Ar)\nand a 15% step was used for complete fusion. The sample\ngas was cleaned in a fully automated all\u2010metal extraction line\nby two GP50 getters (one operated at 450\u00b0C and the other at\nroom temperature) and a slush trap maintained at \u2212140\u00b0F by\na mixture of CO2(s) and acetone. Data were collected using\nan ARGUS multicollector mass spectrometer at the NERC\nArgon Isotope Laboratory, which is housed by the Scottish\nUniversities Environmental Research Centre, Scotland\n[Mark et al., 2009]. For off\u2010line data reduction, we used an\nin\u2010house Excel\u2010based method of age calculation (constructed\nby D. Barford). 40Ar\u201039Ar age results are presented as\nprobability density plots in Figure 14, and full analytical\nresults are provided in Data Set S5. Detrital micas from the\nLower Nimu Formation were particularly small and sparse\nin abundance; thus only a relatively low number of micas\nwere analyzed. Measurement quality deteriorated, and\nuncertainties rapidly rose when the sample to blank ratios of\n40Ar were lower than ca. 10, and as a result only analyses\nwith a higher sample\/blank ratio are used. This particularly\naffects the ability to measure small and young grains.\n6.2.2. Argon\u201040\u2013Argon\u201039 Results\n[39] Modern river sand samples HKT10a and HKT11a\ndraining the Eurasian Plate contain white micas with Early\nCretaceous to Early Jurassic ages as well as Mid\u2010, but\npredominantly Late Miocene aged grains, whereas sample\nZansk\u201002 collected from a modern river sand draining the\nIndian Plate contains white micas with Late Eocene to Late\nMiocene ages.\n[40] Considering the samples from the IBSR sandstones,\nprevious illite crystallinity studies on the Indus Group\ndetermined that postdepositional burial temperature did\nnot exceed lower anchizone metamorphic conditions of\nc. 200\u00b0C [Clift et al., 2002a], implying that the detrital white\nmicas have remained well below the white mica closure\ntemperature of ca. 350\u00b0C [J\u00e4ger, 1967; McDougall and\nHarrison, 1999; von Blanckenburg et al., 1989] through-\nout postdepositional times. Therefore on this basis we\nmake the assumption the analyzed ages represent the timing\nof cooling in their original source terrane.\n[41] The Lower Nimu samples yield dominantly mid\nEocene to lower Oligocene white mica 40Ar\u201039Ar ages.\nSamples NIMU\u201009 and ZG07042 from the Upper Nimu\ncontain the youngest analyzed grains, yielding Late\nMiocene ages, however we do note that the age errors on\nsome of the younger grains are exceptionally high due to\ntheir low radiogenic yields. Nevertheless, the maximum age\nof deposition for this formation can be assigned to Upper\nMiocene times, in agreement with comparable work done\nusing zircon fission track analyses [Schlup et al., 2003].\nThis is considerably younger than the youngest U\u2010Pb\ndetrital zircon age of 41.3 \u00b1 1.0 Ma.\n7. Paleoenvironmental Reconstruction\nand Interpretation\n7.1. Tar Group Sedimentation\n[42] The initial phases of Indus Basin sedimentation\nrepresented by the shales of the Jurutze Formation began\nwith marine deposition in the forearc of the Transhimalayan\narc (in agreement with Clift et al. [2002a], Garzanti and\nvan Haver [1988], and van Haver [1984]). The increasing\noccurrence of more proximal sedimentation with time,\nultimately leading to the deposition of the Sumda Forma-\ntion indicates a switch from deeper marine sedimentation\nof the Jurutze to shallower marine environments of the\nSumda Formation.\n[43] The increase in sandstone upsection with a con-\nformable transition into the subaerial oxygenated environ-\nment of the Chogdo Formation (marked by the presence of\nred shales) combined with coarse, well\u2010rounded clastic\nmaterial and erosive based sandstones suggests that depo-\nsition evolved to a near coastal transitional environment\nsuch as a continental alluvial to subaqueous delta plain\nsetting. A delta system would likely have prograded out into\nshallow marine conditions, feeding the Neo\u2010Tethyan marine\nmargin with arc\u2010derived sediment. The overall fining\nupward pattern observed within the Chogdo corresponds\nwith a return to shallow marine environments marked with\nthe occurrence of the Nummulitic Limestone.\n7.2. Indus Group Sedimentation\n[44] Facies characteristics of the Nurla Formation are very\nsimilar to those of the Chogdo Formation, suggesting that\nsediment was again deposited on a delta\u2010plain marking\nan overall shallowing up cycle from the marine Sumda\nFormation. Due to the tectonic contact, the relationship\nbetween deposition of the Nurla Formation and sedimenta-\ntion of the overlying Choksti Conglomerate is not certain,\nbut is assumed to be relatively continuous in time. The\ngeneral coarse nature of facies belonging to the Choksti\nConglomerate clearly suggests that deposition occurred in a\nvery high\u2010energy proximal environment such as an alluvial\nfan or gravel\u2010dominated braided river. However, the\ndeformed nature of the succession and the lack of paleo-\ncurrent data, both in this formation and throughout the\nsuccession, preclude an assessment of the degree of down-\nslope decrease in grain size, and radial paleodrainage\npattern, which are required to differentiate between these\nHENDERSON ET AL.: GEOLOGY OF THE INDUS BASIN SEDIMENTS TC6015TC6015\n26 of 35\ntwo paleoenvironmental settings. To some extent, such\na distinction is blurred in any case, since transport and\ndeposition of material on alluvial fans often occurs by\nbraided rivers.\n[45] The Red Shale Member of the Choksti Formation\nrepresents deposition in an oxidizing, low\u2010energy environ-\nment likely on a distal part of an alluvial fan or in the\nfloodplain adjacent to a river. A gradual transition to more\nestablished fluvial environments is then observed first with\nthe presence of cross bedded sandstone point bar deposits\nand well\u2010interbedded overbank shales and sandstones\noccurring at the base of the Middle Sandstone Member\n(Figure 5g), representative of sheet flooding. This evolves\ninto established fining upward sedimentary cycles charac-\nterized by the presence of gravel and sandstone in ill\u2010\ndefined channels, infrequent conglomerate and absence\nof extensive overbanks, within the Choksti Formation\u2019s\nMiddle and Upper Sandstone Members indicating deposi-\ntion in a higher\u2010energy alluvial environment. The occur-\nrence of symmetrical ripples in these members indicates\nperiods of oscillatory flow; an atypical feature within fluvial\nenvironments. These wave formed symmetrical ripples\ncould indicate deposition when the alluvial channel system\nperiodically entered a wave dominated shoreline, for\nexample, that of an intermontane basin lake as suggested by\nSinclair and Jaffey [2001].\n[46] Lower Nimu sedimentation is marked by a noticeable\nchange in depositional setting with the occurrence of large\nlenticular beds indicative of a major channelized, river\nsystem (Figure 7l). The relatively low occurrence of shale\nbeds combined with the presence of shale rip up clasts\nwithin angular coarse\u2010grained sandstone and conglomerates\nsuggest that deposition occurred in a high\u2010 to moderate\u2010\nenergy fluvial environment where channelized sands eroded\nand obliterated preexisting floodplain shales and overbank\ndeposits. We propose that the Upper Nimu represents a\ncontinuation to deposition within this major channelized\nriver system, however it is rather more representative\nof floodplain overbank and crevasse splay deposits with\nassociated back swamps. The general coarsening up nature\nof the both the Lower and Upper Nimu formations records\nthe history of a laterally prograding river over its associated\nchannel margin, levee\u2010floodplain deposits.\n8. Provenance\n[47] The establishment of the IBSR provenance is\nimportant for both paleogeographic reconstruction and also\nfor constraining the timing of India\u2010Eurasia collision as\ndetermined by the first mixing of Indian\u2010 and Eurasian\u2010\nderived detritus within the ITSZ and\/or first arrival of\nEurasian detritus onto the Indian plate.\n8.1. Previous Work\n[48] The Chogdo Formation is interpreted by Clift et al.\n[2001a, 2002a] as representing the oldest ITSZ unit\nthat shows evidence of a mixed India and Eurasian prove-\nnance. Clift et al. [2001a, 2002a] interpret the granitoid\nconglomerate clasts as derived from the Eurasian margin\n(Transhimalayan\/Ladakh arc), whereas clasts of red chert,\nFigure 14. Histograms displaying 40Ar\u201039Ar ages of\ndetrital white micas from four Indus Group samples and\nthree modern river sand samples (stacked histogram). Here\n\u201cn\u201d refers to the number of mica grains analyzed per sample.\nHENDERSON ET AL.: GEOLOGY OF THE INDUS BASIN SEDIMENTS TC6015TC6015\n27 of 35\nbasalt, peridotite and associated ophiolitic material are\nall interpreted as derived from the Spontang ophiolite\nproposed as obducted onto the Indian plate either by this\ntime [Corfield and Searle, 2000; Searle et al., 1997a] or in\npost\u2010early Eocene times [Garzanti et al., 1987]. However,\nthe lack of preserved south directed paleocurrents was\nhighlighted by Clift et al. [2001a] as a potential problem\nwith regards to explaining the presence of these granitoid\nclasts as there are no known granitic sources of similar af-\nfinities which lie to the south.\n[49] More recent studies using detrital zircon U\u2010Pb dating\nand Hf isotopic analysis by Wu et al. [2007] found Creta-\nceous Transhimalayan\u2010derived grains to dominate the IBSR\ndetrital zircon population, and the authors interpreted the\npresence of Precambrian aged grains within the Tar Group\nas representative of a Lhasa Block rather than Indian plate\norigin. Wu et al. [2007] found the possibility for the first\nmixed Indian and Eurasian plate contribution only in the\nuppermost stratigraphic levels of the Indus Group (equiva-\nlent to our defined Nimu formations). Their evidence was\nbased on the presence of two detrital zircons analyzed\nto yield ages interpreted by them as unique to the Indian\nPlate; one with a Hf model age of 3.4 Ga and the other with\na U\u2010Pb age of 278 \u00b1 2 Ma.\n[50] Bulk rock Nd isotopic studies are in agreement with\nthe interpretation of a dominantly Eurasian source. \"Nd\nvalues throughout the IBSR are relatively high, indicative of\na dominant Transhimalayan source, with an overall shift to\nmore negative \"Nd values toward higher stratigraphic levels\n[Clift et al., 2001a]. This change was suggested to be a result\nof an additional input from the Lhasa Block by Clift et al.\n[2001a], based on their documented west directed paleo-\ncurrents preserved within the IBSR (Figure 6), rather than a\npossible contribution from the northerly located Karakoram.\nFurthermore, the possibility of an Indian Plate input to\nexplain the shift was also considered unlikely by Clift et al.\n[2001a] as they considered there to be a lack of any detrital\nK\u2010Spar Pb isotope data, or muscovite and garnet, reflective\nof a typical Indian Plate source, within the IBSR at this\nlevel. However, subsequent additional Indian Plate K\u2010spar\nPb isotope characterization [Clift et al., 2002b] shows similar\naffinities to a small proportion of detrital K\u2010spars analyzed\nfrom the IBSR, and one would not expect metamor-\nphic mineralogies to be eroded from High Himalayan\n\u201ccover\u201d during early stages of its exhumation [Najman and\nGarzanti, 2000].\n[51] In support of the proposed lack of Indian plate input,\nSm\u2010Nd isotopic data on individual detrital apatite grains\nfrom the IBSR [Henderson et al., 2010] showed no con-\nclusive evidence of an Indian Plate input; detrital apatites are\ndominantly Transhimalayan derived, with possible detrital\napatite input from the Lhasa Block at higher stratigraphic\nlevels. Despite this evidence, the initial interpretations by\nClift et al. [2001a] remain in conflict with north directed\npaleocurrents [e.g., Sinclair and Jaffey, 2001] (see Figure 6).\n[52] In summary, previous work is contradictory and\ninconclusive in its determination of provenance and thus the\nuse of these rocks to constrain the timing of India\u2010Asia\ncollision based on earliest recorded mixing of Indian and\nAsian detritus is not clear\u2010cut.\n8.2. Provenance Interpretations\n[53] The dominance of Cretaceous\u2010Cenozoic aged zircons\nobtained from our detrital zircon data study of the IBSR\nclearly suggests sediment derivation from the Eurasian Plate\nTranshimalaya since zircons of such age are extremely\nlimited or absent in the Tethyan and Higher Himalaya of the\nIndian plate (Figure 13). Subordinate older (Precambrian)\ngrains could be either Indian or Eurasian (Lhasa Block) (e.g.,\nChu et al. [2006], Leier et al. [2007], and Figure 13) derived.\nWu et al. [2007] considered it more likely that the subordi-\nnate Precambrian zircons identified from the Tar Group were\nsourced from the Lhasa Block basement based on their\ninterpretation of zircon Hf data. Jurassic U\u2010Pb detrital zircon\nages obtained from Nummulitic Limestone (ZG07062) and\nNurla (ZG06042) samples (see Figure 13) are likely to have\neither been sourced from north Kohistan [Schaltegger et al.,\n2002], Lhasa Block (see HKT10A\/11A in Figure 14), and\/or\ngabbros and ultramafics associated with the Dras Arc\ncomplex [Reuber et al., 1989]. We conclude that zircon\nU\u2010Pb ages provide no unequivocal evidence for an Indian\nPlate contribution to the IBSR.\n[54] A predominantly Eurasian source for the IBSR is\nbacked up by petrography. Evolution of the sandstone\npetrography (Figure 10) indicates that the IBSR were dom-\ninantly derived from a magmatic arc which was undergoing\nprogressive dissection and unroofing of volcanic cover to\ngranitoid roots (as defined by Dickinson and Suczek [1979]\nand modeled by Garzanti et al. [2007]) in agreement with\nthe work of Garzanti and van Haver [1988]. This progres-\nsive dissection is additionally recorded by the upsection\nincrease (by the time of deposition of the Upper Nimu\nFormation) in proportion of granitoid clasts in the con-\nglomerates and increase in detrital quartz, plagioclase, and\nhornblende, and subsequent decrease in volcanic lithic grains\nin the sandstones.\n[55] Our conclusions differ from some previous investi-\ngations which advocate input from the Indian plate early in\nthe stratigraphy, based on petrography, presence of north\ndirected paleocurrent indicators and sedimentary and ophio-\nlite conglomerate clasts (interpreted as derived from Indian\npassive margin and the Spongtang ophiolite obducted onto\nthe Indian plate, respectively). Brookfield and Andrews\u2010\nSpeed [1984] suggested that IBSR petrography indicated\na continental block or recycled orogen source for Indus\nBasin sediments. We suggest that these provenance con-\nclusions may have arisen from previous workers\u2019 overesti-\nmation of sedimentary lithic clasts and\/or matrix content\n[Garzanti and van Haver, 1988], or underestimation of\nfeldspars, many of which have been heavily (partially) altered\nto clays.\n[56] The overall scarcity of preserved paleoflow indicators\nwithin the Tar Group, combined with the two episodes of\ncontraction deformation (see section 3) means that paleo-\ncurrent measurements from these lower stratigraphic levels\nare likely to be both inaccurate and imprecise. The variability\nin paleoflow data is clearly documented within measure-\nments from the Chogdo Formation with tectonically restored\npaleoflow recordings from this study showing a southwest\nflow component, opposing the observed north\u2010northeast\nHENDERSON ET AL.: GEOLOGY OF THE INDUS BASIN SEDIMENTS TC6015TC6015\n28 of 35\nflow direction obtained by Clift et al. [2001a] from the same\nstratigraphic level.\n[57] We consider that the observed clastic and carbonate\nsedimentary clasts identified within the Tar Group are likely\nto be autoclastic in nature (see section 5.2). We suggest that\nophiolitic and chert clasts, interpreted by previous workers\nas derived from the Indian plate, could be Eurasian derived.\nThe occurrence of ophiolite detritus was suggested by\nGarzanti and van Haver [1988] to have been supplied from\nthe northern Shyok Suture Zone (SSZ). Due to its consid-\nerably northerly location and the likely high topography\nexisting between the SSZ and ITSZ by that time, we suggest\nthat this is unlikely, though possible based on the occurrence\nof Precambrian zircons in the IBSR, most likely derived\nfrom Eurasian plate basement lying to the north of the arc\n[Wu et al., 2007]. More likely, a probable Eurasian source for\nthese clasts can be found in lithologies associated with the\nDras Arc [Searle et al., 1999]. The rather limited present\u2010day\nexposure of oceanic rocks preserved in the Dras Arc unit\non the Eurasian margin [Reuber, 1989] contains ultra-\nmafics (peridotites), gabbro and diabase in association with\na Jurassic aged chert assemblage [Honegger et al., 1982;\nReuber, 1989]. Thus, we suggest that it is viable for the\nTar Group to contain solely Eurasian plate\u2010derived clasts\nand detritus.\n[58] The lowest stratigraphic level within the IBSR to\nshow unequivocal evidence of a mixed India and Eurasian\ninput is the Upper Sandstone Member of the Choksti For-\nmation, marked by the first occurrence of detrital white\nmicas (see section 5.1). White micas increase in abundance\nupsection and become datable (due to their increased grain\nsize) in the overlying Nimu Formation. Mid Eocene to Upper\nMiocene mica Ar\u2010Ar ages are consistent with sourcing from\nthe Indian Plate\u2019s HHCS which was exhuming at that time\nand from which white micas of such age have been recorded\n[Brewer et al., 2006; Szulc et al., 2006; White et al., 2002]\n(Figure 14). White mica is rare from Transhimalayan mineral\nassemblages, and Lhasa Block sourced white mica ages,\npredominantly of Late Miocene and Early Cretaceous age\n(our samples HKT10a and HKT11a) are not comparable with\nthe majority of our analyzed Indus Group detrital ages. No\nother High Himalayan associated metamorphic assemblages,\nsuch as medium\u2010grade metamorphic rock fragments, or other\nBarrovian metamorphic minerals were identified. This is to\nbe expected during the early stages of exhumation of the\nHHCS, when the less metamorphosed shallower cover was\nbeing eroded. Therefore, we also recognize that less meta-\nmorphosed nonmicaceous Indian plate material likely was\nexhumed earlier than the detrital micas seen in the Upper\nSandstone Member of the Choksti Formation and may lie\nundetected in older IBSR.\n[59] Within the Lower Nimu Formation is also the pres-\nence of what we interpret to be nonautogenic limestone\nclasts; our argument regarding their nonautogenic nature\nbased on the lack of limestone formations preserved in the\nupper stratigraphic levels of the IBSR, and the dissimilarity\nof the clast carbonate lithology compared to limestones\nfound in the IBSR (see section 5.2). We propose that\nthe limestone clasts were sourced from the Indian Slope\nmargin, as the Eurasian plate limestones (e.g., Sumda, Num-\nmulitic, and Khalsi limestones) were likely to be buried by\nthis time.\n[60] Therefore our provenance data show that the IBSR\nare overwhelmingly dominated by Eurasian sources, with\nonly the first unequivocal suggestion of an additional Indian\nPlate sedimentary input in the Lower Miocene Choksti\nFormation\u2019s Upper Sandstone Member, with the appearance\nof (undated) white mica followed by dated white micas and\nlimestone clasts interpreted as Indian plate origin in the\noverlying Nimu Formation. These data are in agreement\nwith our previous work using a new technique, Sm\u2010Nd\nanalyses on single grain apatites, to discriminate between\nIndian and Eurasian sources in the IBSR [Henderson et al.,\n2010], and similar to observations in the Yarlung Tsangpo\nsuture zone (the easterly equivalent of the ITSZ) where in\nTibet the Lower Miocene Gangrinboche conglomerate is\nthe first formation to record evidence of mixed Indian and\nEurasian plate input [Aitchison et al., 2002].\n[61] We conclude that in this studied section (the Zanskar\nGorge), the Chogdo Formation does not contain evidence\nof mixed Indian\u2010Asian detritus, and does not constrain\nIndia\u2010Asia collision to have occurred by 50 Ma. Henderson\net al. (submitted manuscript, 2010) expand on this topic,\ndiscussing both the evidence for first arrival of Asian\nmaterial on the Indian plate, as well as first documentation\nof mixed Indian and Asian detritus in the IBSR, also\nencompassing a wider geographical study area where the\nIBSR is exposed.\n9. Paleo\u2010Indus River Initiation\n[62] The modern\u2010day Indus River (Figure 1) represents a\nmajor axial river system within the Himalaya. Initiating at\nMount Kailas in south Tibet and flowing west along the\nITSZ before diverting southward to cut through the Indian\nplate, the Indus is responsible for transporting vast quantities\nof sediment eroded from the central and western Himalaya\ntoward the river\u2019s terminus at the Indus Fan in the Arabian\nSea. Thus, the need for determining the timing of Indus\nRiver initiation during the early phases of orogenesis is vital\nif we are to understand the rate of sediment denudation, and\nassess mechanisms of coupled tectonics and exhumation\u2010\nerosion processes [e.g., Zeitler et al., 2001].\n[63] Whole rock Nd and K\u2010feldspar Pb isotopic analysis\non mid Eocene Indus Fan sediments has indicated that\nsediment was likely sourced from a mixture of the Eurasian\ncrust (Lhasa and Karakoram blocks), Kohistan\u2010Ladakh Is-\nland Arc\/Transhimalaya, and Indian plate, implying that a\nmajor river drained as far north as Eurasia and deposited\nmaterial into the Indus Fan just after India\u2010Eurasia collision\n[Clift et al., 2001b]. However, the precise source of these\nPaleogene fan sediments remains difficult to interpret, and\nthe date of paleo\u2010Indus River initiation as an axial river\nflowing along the suture zone, remains controversial [Clift\net al., 2001a; Najman, 2006, section 5.2.2.2; Searle et al.,\n1990; Sinclair and Jaffey, 2001].\n[64] In the Zanskar Gorge section, westerly directed\npaleoflow indicators in the Nurla and Choksti Formations\n[Clift et al., 2001a, Figure 6] were interpreted by those\nauthors to suggest initiation of an axial flowing paleo\u2010Indus\nHENDERSON ET AL.: GEOLOGY OF THE INDUS BASIN SEDIMENTS TC6015TC6015\n29 of 35\nRiver within the ITSZ as early as mid\u2010Eocene times. Clift\net al. [2001a] supported their view by arguing that the\nshift in \"Nd values between their Chogdo and Nurla for-\nmations (as discussed in section 8) could only be explained\nby input from the Lhasa Block which lies to the east of the\nstudy area, thus confirming axial drainage. However,\nSinclair and Jaffey [2001] concluded that the Indus Group\nexposed along the Zanskar Gorge does not record evidence\nfor axial paleo\u2010Indus River initiation, based on variable\npaleoflow directions throughout the stratigraphy which they\ninterpreted as the result of transverse drainages into an\ninternally drained basin. Furthermore, contrary to Clift et al.\n[2001a, 2002a], Najman [2006] did not consider that a\nLhasa Block input was necessary to explain the shift in\n\"Nd to more negative values between deposition of the\nChogdo and Nurla formations. Rather she suggested that the\nshift could be explained by greater contribution from the\nKarakoram, considered to be an along\u2010strike equivalent\nof the Lhasa Block which lies due north of the Zanskar\nGorge study area, with the detritus delivered by trans-\nverse drainages.\n[65] Combining our paleodepositional environmental and\nprovenance interpretations (see sections 7 and 8) with our\nown paleoflow data (Figure 6) we assess the significance\nthat our data bears for providing evidence concerning the\ninitiation of the paleo\u2010Indus River.\n[66] Symmetrical ripples preserved in the shallow marine\nSumda Formation provide a northeast\u2010southwest paleoflow\ndirection, perpendicular to the Eurasian continental paleo-\nmargin. We find very few reliable paleoflow indicators\npreserved within the Chogdo Formation, and those that there\nare suggest flow to the southwest. There is no evidence of\nmixed Indian\u2010 and Eurasian\u2010derived detritus in the forma-\ntion (see section 8) which could support an interpretation of\ntransportation in an axial river environment. Asymmetric\nshallow marine ripples in the Nummulitic Limestone show a\nsouthward directed current. We recognize that the overall\nlow abundance of available paleocurrent indicators within\nthe Tar Group, in particular from the nonmarine facies,\nhinders the possibility for making robust paleodrainage\ninterpretations for these formations.\n[67] We did not record any paleocurrent data from the\nNurla Formation. Contrary to Sinclair and Jaffey [2001], we\ndiscount any apparent clast imbrications within the Choksti\nBasal Conglomerate as being valid paleoflow indicators\n(as outlined in section 3.2.2). As discussed in section 7.2 it\nis difficult to determine the exact depositional environment\nof this conglomerate. Paleoflow measurements are based on\ntrough cross bedding (representing main channel flow) and\nasymmetrical ripples (interpreted as relating to overbank\ndeposition, e.g., by crevasse splay, perpendicular to main\nchannel flow), which overall provide a southerly directed\npaleoflow (Figure 6) indicative of transverse drainage. This,\ncombined with the dominant presence of proximally sourced\nlarge (<30 cm) gravel clasts suggests a paleodepositional\nenvironment atypical for major axial river development.\nSymmetrical ripples taken from the Middle and Upper\nSandstone Members of the Choksti Formation record north\u2010\nnortheast\u2010south\u2010southwest wave direction perpendicular to a\nproposed intermontane lake shoreline (section 7.2, Figure 6)\nwhile planar cross bedding indicates a north\u2010northeast\ndirected flow, based on only four measurements. Prove-\nnance data potentially show first evidence of mixed Indian\nand Asian detritus, with the first occurrence of (undated)\nwhite mica (section 8).\n[68] Evidence of an axial paleo\u2010Indus River occurring\nwithin this examined area (i.e., the Zanskar Gorge) is\nrecorded at the base of the Lower Nimu Formation which is\nmarked by both a change in sedimentary environment with\nthe development of a major more stable channel river sys-\ntem (section 7.2, Figure 7l), and also the introduction of\nlimestone clasts possibly sourced from the Indian margin\n(section 8.1), and white micas with Ar\u2010Ar ages typical of\nHigh Himalayan derivation (micas in the underlying Choksti\nFormation were too small for analysis but in all probability\nwere derived from the same source). Paleoflow indicators\nformed in the channel environment (e.g., trough cross bed-\nding and flute casts) provide a northwest paleoflow direc-\ntion (Figure 6), while sedimentary structures which may\nbe more readily produced in association with overbank\ndeposition (e.g., asymmetrical ripples, as observed on the\nmodern\u2010day Indus River banks), preserve northeast directed\npaleoflows, perpendicular to the main river channel, as\nmight be expected from overbank flow.\n[69] In summary, we see unequivocal evidence for devel-\nopment of a northwest directed axial river in the (<Miocene)\nNimu Formation. Since the modern\u2010day Indus River is\ncomposed of a range of fluvial morphologies from braided\nand anastomosing in its upper reaches, to meandering and\nstraight river channels further downstream [Jorgensen et al.,\n1993], braided facies of the Middle and Upper (white mica\nbearing) Choksti Formation sandstone members could\nrepresent early initiation of a throughflowing paleo\u2010Indus\n(interchangeable with lacustrine environments), however\nthere is a lack of reliable northwest directed paleocurrent data\nto confirm this.\n[70] The paleoenvironmental and provenance interpreta-\ntion outlined above therefore imply that an axial river had\nyet to be established within this examined Ladakh region of\nthe ITSZ during mid\u2010Eocene times. Contrary to the view of\nClift et al. [2001a], our observations suggest that axial\nthroughflow of the paleo\u2010Indus within this study area began\naround the Early Miocene. This is consistent with the\nmarked increase in Indus Fan sedimentation in the Middle\nMiocene and associated strong channel\u2010levee development\n[Clift et al., 2001b]. Prior to this time, data from the Indus\nFan indicate that a river draining the Indian Plate and\nTranshimalaya\/Kohistan Ladakh island arc was sourcing the\nfan, but there is no evidence from this region that it flowed\naxially along the suture zone prior to Late Oligocene \u2013 Early\nMiocene times.\n10. Summary: Paleogeographic\nReconstruction\n[71] The Shyok Suture Zone (SSZ), to the north of the\nITSZ represents the line of collision between the Kohistan\u2010\nLadakh Island Arc and Eurasia during mid\u2010late Cretaceous\ntimes and further south, the ITSZ is considered to record\ncollision between the combined Eurasian plate and the\nHENDERSON ET AL.: GEOLOGY OF THE INDUS BASIN SEDIMENTS TC6015TC6015\n30 of 35\nFigure 15\nHENDERSON ET AL.: GEOLOGY OF THE INDUS BASIN SEDIMENTS TC6015TC6015\n31 of 35\nKohistan\u2010Ladakh Island arc, with the Indian plate [Clift\net al., 2001a, 2002a; Garzanti and van Haver, 1988; Najman,\n2006; Searle et al., 1988; Treloar et al., 1989a]. However,\nmuch uncertainty still exists with regards to the order and\nnature of tectonic events which governed the early phases of\nIndia\u2010Eurasia collision. One of these issues concerns the\ncollisional history of Kohistan\u2010Ladakh Island Arc with most\nauthors suggesting that it collided with Eurasia before India in\nthe mid\u2010late Cretaceous [e.g.,Clift et al., 2000;Gaetani et al.,\n1993; Maheo et al., 2006; Robertson and Collins, 2002;\nRolland et al., 2000; Searle et al., 1988; Treloar, 1997;\nTreloar et al., 2003], and others suggesting an India\u2010arc\ncollision at 61Ma, predating India\u2010Eurasia collision at 50Ma\n[e.g., Andrews\u2010Speed and Brookfield, 1982; Khan et al.,\n2009]. Although that problem is beyond the scope of this\npaper, detrital zircon data from the Jurutze Formation (see\nsection 8) suggests Lhasa Block contributing sediment within\nthe ITSZ by 53.4 (\u00b11.4) Ma, favoring docking of the\nKohistan\u2010Ladakh Island Arc and Eurasia earlier than a 50Ma\nIndia\u2010Eurasia collision. We recognize, however, that further\nanalysis and terrane characterization (e.g., Hf analysis of\ndetrital zircons to confirm the distinction between Indian and\nLhasa Block characteristics for Precambrian zircons) is\nneeded to corroborate this interpretation. For the purpose of\nour model we follow the more widely held theory which\nhas Kohistan\u2010Ladakh Island Arc\u2010Eurasia collision prior to\nIndia\u2010arc collision and we advance the following paleoen-\nvironmental and tectonic model governing the deposition of\nthe Indus Basin sediments within the ITSZ during the dif-\nferent phases of collision.\n[72] 1. Post collision of Dras\u2010KLIA with Eurasia occurs\n(Figure 15a; Jurutze and Sumda Formations, mid\u2010Cretaceous\n<54.9\u201351 Ma). During mid\u2010Cretaceous to early Eocene\ntimes the former Kohistan\u2010Ladakh Island arcs and Dras is-\nland arcs had docked against the southern margin of Eurasia,\nto form the active continental arc system above a northward\ndipping subduction zone consisting of Neo\u2010Tehyan oceanic\ncrust [e.g., Corfield et al., 2001;Mah\u00e9o et al., 2004; Rolland\net al., 2002b; Thakur and Mishra, 1984; Treloar et al.,\n1996]. The present\u2010day occurrence of Dras Arc volcanics\nand associated volcaniclastic forearc lithologies of the\nNindam Formation at the southern margins of the ITSZ,\nsouth of the Indus Basin sediments [Clift et al., 2000, 2002a;\nRobertson and Collins, 2002; Steck, 2003] suggests that\ndirect correlation of the Dras Arc with the Kohistan\u2010Ladakh\narc, which lies to the north of the Indus Basin sediments [e.g.,\nCoward et al., 1986], is not straightforward. We suggest that,\nin accordance with the model of Garzanti and van Haver\n[1988], early Indus Basin sedimentation (Jurutze and Sumda\nFormations) took place in an arc\u2010bounded depression\nbetween the Kohistan\u2010Ladakh arc to the north and the Dras\narc to the south. Sedimentation was dominated by the depo-\nsition of marine shales (Jurutze Formation) and associated\nlimestones (Sumda Formation). Sediment was sourced from\nthe Eurasian plate, predominantly derived from the Kohistan\u2010\nLadakh Island Arc volcanics with a minor component derived\nfrom early exhumed granites. Granitoid plutons were con-\ntinually intruded into the adjoined Dras\/Kohistan\u2010Ladakh\narc\u2010Eurasian margin in an Andean\u2010type subduction\u2010related\nevent; locally referred to in India as the Ladakh Batholith\n[e.g., Frank et al., 1977; Honegger et al., 1982; Weinberg\nand Dunlap, 2000] and in Pakistan as the Kohistan Batholith\n[e.g., Krol et al., 1996; Petterson and Windley, 1985, 1991].\nThe presence of Precambrian zircons in the detritus suggests\nadditional sediment sourcing from Eurasian continental crust,\ni.e., the Karakoram\/Lhasa Block [Wu et al., 2007]. The\nsouthern margin of the Dras arc experienced shallow marine\ndeposition of the Khalsi Limestone, with the forearc basin\nsouth of the Dras arc dominated by deposition of volcani-\nclastic marine sediments of the Nindam Formation.\n[73] 2. Continental sedimentation in an internally drained\nbasin occurs (Figure 15b; Chogdo Formation, 54.9\u201351 to\n50.8\u201349.4 Ma). The cessation of marine conditions within\nthe arc\u2010bounded depression is well preserved within the\nsedimentary record with the termination of the Sumda\nFormation and subsequent conformable transitional marine\u2010\ncontinental sedimentation of the Chogdo Formation during\npost early Eocene times. Deltas were fed into the arc\u2010\nbounded basin from the north (and south), deriving sedi-\nments from the Dras\/Kohistan\u2010Ladakh arc and Lhasa Block\/\nKarakoram, thus creating the Chogdo Formation. Ultramafic\nrocks were either sourced directly from the Dras Arc and\/or\nKohistan\u2010Ladakh arc oceanic crust basement, or potentially\nfrom the SSZ.\n[74] 3. Marine incursion occurs (Figure 15c; Nummulitic\nLimestone, 50.8 < 49.4 Ma). Sedimentation in the conti-\nnental arc\u2010bounded basin retrograded and there was a return\nto shallow marine conditions on the southern margin of the\ncontinental arc; marked by the conformable transition into\nthe Nummulitic Limestone. The notable change in detrital\nzircon Jurassic U\u2010Pb ages (either sourced from the Dras Arc\ncomplex, Karakoram or Lhasa Block) in the Nummulitic\nLimestone, suggests that fluvial sediment was sourced from\nnew arc areas.\n[75] 4. Northern\u2010derived transverse alluvial drainage fol-\nlowing the final retreat of the Tethys ocean occurs (Figure 15d;\nNurla and Choksti Formations, <50.8\u201349.4 to c. 24 Ma).\nThe collision of India with the southern margin of Eurasia\ncaused an end to marine deposition and return to continental\nsedimentation, and it is favored that this represents a con-\nstraint to the timing of India\u2010Eurasia collision by 50.8 to\n49.4 Ma as defined by the youngest marine facies of the\nNummulitic Limestone. The conformable transitional switch\nto continental sedimentation is marked by the Nurla For-\nmation in a deltaic environment similar to that of the\nChogdo Formation. As collision progressed, erosion from\nthe relatively higher\u2010relief Eurasian margin resulted in the\ndevelopment of large northerly derived, southerly directed\nFigure 15.

Paleo\u2010Indus axial river initiation occurs (Figure 15e;\nNimu Formation and possibly Upper Choksti Formation,\nc. 24 Ma). We suggest that a well\u2010established axial Indus\nRiver, flowing west along the suture zone, did not initiate in\nthis region until Nimu Formation times (or potentially as\nearly as Upper Choksti Formation depositional times), as\nrecorded by northwest directed paleocurrents and the devel-\nopment of a large single channel river system fed by sediment\nfrom both the Eurasian and Indian margins. Initial paleo\u2010\nIndus River development was likely to have evolved from\nbraided alluvial and intermontane basin lake sedimentation\nas recorded in the Middle\u2010Upper Choksti Formation Sand-\nstone Members. Exhumation of the metamorphosed Higher\nHimalayan Crystalline terrane occurred through the devel-\nopment of the MCT and Zanskar Thrust systems that took\nplace by c. 24 Ma, which increased the relative relief of the\nIndian margin, feeding early exhumed High Himalayan\u2010\nderived micas into the suture zone. The presence of these\ndetrital micas, with ages as young as 23 Ma, within the Indus\nGroup implies that suture zone sedimentation continued until\nat least the Late Miocene.\n[77] Acknowledgments.
