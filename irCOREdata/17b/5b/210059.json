Introduction \nA popular explanation of current fertility trends in Western societies is the neoclassical \neconomic theory (Becker 1981), which assumes that it is economically advantageous \nfor spouses to specialize in market and in family work, respectively. As women\u2019s level \nof employment has risen during the last decades, women\u2019s increasing income has raised \nthe opportunity costs of having children, lowering the presumed advantage of \nspecialization. While these changes explain the drop in fertility in many Western \ncountries, they do not fully account for the differences in fertility levels between these \ncountries (Friedman et al. 1994). Recent research on the low levels of fertility in \nWestern societies has suggested that not just the division of market work between the \nspouses but also the division of household work are key to their explanation (McDonald \n2000a, 2000b; Ol\u00e1h 2003; Cooke 2004; Torr and Short 2004; de Laat and Sevilla Sanz \n2007). The main argument is that women find it difficult to combine work and family if \nthe household work is divided in the traditional way between the spouses. As a \nconsequence women are reluctant to have children especially if they pursue a career. A \nmore egalitarian setting should be associated with fewer stressors and higher fertility \nrates. \nThe other major explanation of current fertility trends emphasizes the importance \nof ideational and cultural factors as part of the theory of the \u2018Second Demographic \nTransition\u2019 (van de Kaa 1987; Lesthaeghe 1995). According to this approach, the drop \nin fertility in Western societies was related to a change in the role and structure of the \nfamily in the context of rising postmaterialist values of self-expression and quality of \nlife. This change might have progressed differently in different societal groups. In \ncontrast, Becker\u2019s neoclassical economic theory presumes that all people have the same \npreferences about children. If one assumes that some couples are more eager for the \nwoman to have a career than others, and that some couples have a more positive attitude \nto children than others, one can distinguish three situations: (a) The couple values \nchildren highly and wants the woman to be in paid work: these couples should profit \nfrom equality in the societal institutions and in the home when pursuing their fertility \ngoals. (b) The couple does not especially value the woman\u2019s involvement in paid work \nbut still holds positive values of children. These couples\u2019 intentions are compatible with \na more traditional male breadwinner model. (c) The couple does not hold positive \nvalues of children. For these couples one would expect no relationship between gender \nequality and fertility. To test these scenarios it is necessary to consider in fertility \nmodels attitudes to children and to women\u2019s careers and the anticipated gender division \nof household work.  \nPeople\u2019s attitudes partly reflect the current societal conditions and partly earlier \nindividual experiences through which they were formed (Fishbein and Ajzen 1975). \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 39 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 1453 \nTherefore, considering attitudes means not only taking subjective aspects into account \nbut indirectly also past experiences. A possible problem of the analytic strategy is that \nthe attitudes to children, to women\u2019s participation in paid work, and the gender division \nof household work are dependent on each other. For example, the expectations about \nlabour-market participation and childbirth could influence (the choice of spouse and) \nthe gender division of work in the home. Similarly, the attitudes to children could result \nfrom career ambitions and the gender division of household work. In the first part of my \nanalyses I will explore whether the values of children are related to the other two \nindicators in East and West Germany. Studying the two parts of Germany is a unique \nopportunity to compare two countries where the socio-legal framework for families and \nworking lives have been quickly aligned after 1989 but where past experiences and, \ntherefore, attitudes might differ strongly. I use data from the survey about \u2018Change and \nDevelopment of Family Life Forms\u2019 (Familiensurvey, FS) (Deutsches Jugendinstitut \n2004), which provides representative samples of the East and West-German populations \naged 18 to 55 in 1988 (West only), 1990-1 (East only), 1994 and 2000 (both East and \nWest). The final analyses assess the importance of gender roles in the home and \nattitudes to children for first births in West Germany, using the West-German panel \nwaves from 1988, 1994, and 2000. The main hypothesis is that both traditional couples \nand couples with positive values of children and a relatively equal gender division of \nhousehold work have a high propensity of having children. \n \n \n2. Theoretical background \n2.1 Gendered division of household work and fertility  \nAccording to McDonald (2000a, 2000b), the male breadwinner model has changed in \nWestern societies towards a gender-equity model especially in institutions of education \nand market employment, opening up considerable opportunities to women outside the \nrole of mother. As a consequence, young women have increasingly pursued a career \nand childbearing ages have risen. McDonald has argued that if family-oriented \ninstitutions have adapted to this new behaviour, fertility rates could remain relatively \nhigh, but that in countries where attitudes and family-oriented institutions have \nremained closer to the male breadwinner model it has been more difficult to combine \nwork and family, resulting in lower levels of fertility. His description is in line with the \nobserved relationship between men\u2019s involvement in household tasks and fertility levels \nin industrialized countries: from their literature review, de Laat and Sevilla Sanz \n(2004:8) concluded that \u2018relatively high fertility and high female labor force \nparticipation countries are characterized by families favoring a more balanced division \nHenz: Gender roles and values of children \n1454  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org \n                                                          \nof housework in which women take on a smaller share of housework\u2019. De Laat and \nSevilla Sanz (2004) argue that more children require more household work, and that in \negalitarian countries it is easier for men to contribute substantially more to the \nhousehold work than in less egalitarian countries because it is associated with less \nsocial stigma. As a result, men do more household work and thus the couples can afford \nto have more children even if the woman is working. Turning from the country level to \nthe household level, egalitarian families should still have fewer children than traditional \nfamilies in the same country because neither spouse values doing household work. De \nLaat and Sevilla Sanz (2004) find support for these hypotheses in their analysis.  \nA further elaboration of these ideas by Torr and Short (2004) consisted of \nintroducing \u2018gender ideology\u2019 as a mediating factor between household work and \nfertility: not housework division per se but its evaluation as fair or unfair should be \nrelated to fertility. This elaboration suggests a U-shaped pattern between man\u2019s share of \nhousehold work and fertility. In their analysis of US transitions to a second child they \nfound that both couples with an equal division of household work and couples with an \nextremely unequal division of household work had high fertility rates. However, gender \nideology did not exert an independent effect on fertility.  \n \n \n2.2 Values of children \nOne of the weaknesses of the neoclassical economic theory is the assumption that \npeople\u2019s attitudes to children are the same for men and women in all situations and \ncircumstances (Nauck 2000). The social-psychological \u2018value-of-children-approach\u2019 \noffers a suitable framework to incorporate such differences. Originally developed by \nHoffman and Hoffman (1973), it formulates a set of economic, normative and \npsychological categories that are thought to influence people\u2019s fertility behaviour.2 \nHoffman and Hoffman\u2019s values-of-children concept is part of a broader model of \nfertility that also takes alternatives into account that produce the same values for \n(potential) parents, the direct and indirect costs of having children, as well as the \n2 Hoffman and Hoffman (1973) give the potential values of children as: children give primary group ties and \naffiliation to the parent; they can be stimulating and fun; children can be an expansion of the self; they help \nform an adult status and social identity; they provide a sense of achievement and creativity; childbearing is \noften seen as a moral act; they can be an economic utility; they can give parents power in their society; \nparents might gain a sense of creativity and accomplishment from rearing children; and parents can get a \ncompetitive advantage from having children. \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 39 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 1455 \nbarriers and incentives for having them. The approach has been applied in a number of \nstudies (Arnold 1975; Hoffman and Manis 1979; Fawcett 1988). \nIn an attempt to clarify the theoretical foundations of the value-of-children \napproach, Nauck has recently integrated it into the general theory of social production \nfunctions (Nauck 2005, 2007). In this context it tries to explain \u2018how and under which \nconditions children become intermediate goods in their (potential) parents\u2019 social \nproduction function by optimizing their social esteem and physical well-being\u2019 (Nauck \n2005:186). Nauck derived a four-dimensional utility function of children: their labour \nutility in contributing to the household production or the household income; their \ninsurance utility against life\u2019s eventualities; their status-attainment utility by creating \nnew relations, changing existing ones, or directly affecting parents\u2019 status; and their \nemotional utility through creating intimate life-long bonds. The labour and insurance \nutilities might be of comparatively little importance in Western welfare states but some \naspects of the insurance utility are actually part of many instruments for measuring the \nvalues of children. \nIn his version of the value-of-children approach, Nauck is mostly concerned with \nthe value of children for their parents without focusing on differences between mothers \nand fathers. Much of his work actually only addresses women\u2019s values of children \n(Nauck 2007; Nauck and Klaus 2007). However, the model allows for an elaboration of \ndifferences between men\u2019s and women\u2019s values of children if one assumes that men and \nwomen maximize their social esteem and physical well-being in different ways. Nauck \nsuggests that especially for mothers, children can improve social integration and \nthereby heighten their social esteem (Nauck 2005:187). Nauck also spells out the \ncontribution of parenthood to self-validation and personal identity formation, giving \nmeaning and relevance to personality (Nauck 2005:187). Although this applies to both \nmen and women, one could argue that women as primary caretakers and nurturers of \nchildren profit more from parenthood than men whose identities are, in contrast, more \nfocused on paid work and the provider role. However, if suggestions by Friedman and \nher co-authors (1994) and Beck and Beck-Gernsheim (1995) about a child as a major \nsource of stability in life are correct, children could become increasingly important for \nboth men\u2019s and women\u2019s identity. In terms of costs, children can threaten the social \nesteem and physical well-being that is gained from individual leisure time or from \nwomen having a career, and because family and children are still predominantly the \ndomain of women, women might be more affected than men. \n \nHenz: Gender roles and values of children \n1456  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org \n                                                          \n3. The case of Germany \n3.1 Family and fertility policies in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) and \nthe Federal Republic of Germany (FRG)  \nEast and West Germany are interesting cases for a comparative study because of their \nspecific mixture of similarities and differences in the conduct of private life (Schneider \n1994; Schneider et al. 1995). One of the most striking differences between the two parts \nof Germany refers to women\u2019s employment. In West Germany, tax regulations strongly \nsupport the male breadwinner model. The majority of women interrupt employment at \nchildbirth. While older generations of women never returned to the labour market, \nyounger generations increasingly go back to work, and the times outside the labour \nmarket have got shorter. Since 1986 parents can stay at home with their child for up to \nthree years while keeping the right to the job and getting a flat rate benefit for up to 18 \nmonths, which is means tested for part of the time.3 Public childcare offers mainly part-\ntime places for three to six year olds. It reached nearly full coverage in the 1990s. Time \nin school is usually limited to half days. \nIn the former GDR women fully participated in the labour market. After a new \npolicy was established in the 1970s women were allowed to take an employment break \nafter childbirth. Since 1986 women could stay at home for up to one year after \nchildbirth while retaining 70-90 per cent of their salary (Trappe 1995). The normative \nmodel of combining full-time work and parenthood was supported by a bundle of social \nand family benefits, e.g. shorter working hours, access to housing, and low-cost public \nchildcare. Thereby the state took over a large part of the time and financial costs of \nbringing up children (Schneider et al. 1995).  \nSince reunification, both parts of Germany have been governed by the same laws \nand social security system although some provisions were paid at a lower level in East \nGermany. The high level of kindergarten provision in East Germany was cut \nsubstantially after re-unification but because of the drop in fertility and possibly also a \ndrop in demand of parents, day care for children was still readily available in Eastern \nGermany (Hank and Kreyenfeld 2003). West Germany continued expanding \nkindergartens at a slow pace. Both parts of Germany experienced increasing levels of \nunemployment with higher levels in East Germany. \n3 These parental-leave regulations applied to the early 1990s. In 2007 a major policy reform has introduced a \nnew parental allowance (\u2018Elterngeld\u2019), which pays fathers or mothers a share of their last income for up to 14 \nmonths. \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 39 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 1457 \n                                                          \nRegarding family development, both parts of Germany have followed a special \npath in a European context (Schneider et al. 1995). West Germany experienced a \npolarization of living arrangements into a declining family\/child oriented sector and a \npluralized childless sector that is oriented towards employment (H\u00f6hn and Dorbritz \n1995; Strohmeier 1995; Strohmeier and Schulze 1995; Federkeil 1997). The \nfamily\/child oriented sector consisted mostly of married couples with children, a \nmajority of which followed the classic male breadwinner model. Smaller groups were \nformed by single mothers and even less common living arrangements with children.  \nThe childless sector consisted of married couples without children and employed or not \nemployed women, unmarried couples, and singles. The notion of a polarization of \nliving arrangements is not only based on the increasing non-child sector but is also \nexpressed in the increasing number of children among married couples (H\u00f6hn and \nDorbritz 1995).4 This contrasts with the GDR where living with children remained the \nnormal life style although the family size decreased. Insofar living arrangements reflect \nfamily preferences one would expect more homogenous attitudes to children among \nEast Germans and more variation among West Germans. Despite the differences \nbetween the former GDR and the former FRG, having a child was more consequential \nfor women\u2019s careers than for men\u2019s in both countries because in both countries most \nwomen assumed the primary responsibility for bringing up children.  \nFigure 1 depicts the total fertility rates in the two parts of Germany. It shows the \nincrease of the fertility rate in the GDR following the policy reforms of the early 1970s \nand the collapse of GDR birth rates after re-unification. The drop in East-German \nfertility levels was partly due to a change in the East-German states towards higher ages \nat first birth (Witte and Wagner 1995; Conrad et al. 1996; Kreyenfeld 2003). The most \nprominent explanation for the fertility decline in East Germany, however, has been the \ndifficulty of combining family and employment under the new Western system \n(Schneider et al. 1995). This was not only because women\u2019s access to employment and \ntheir chances for occupational upward mobility weakened after the German re-\nunification compared to men\u2019s, but also because of cuts or insufficient adaptation of \ninfrastructure that aimed at facilitating to combine family and employment. These \nchanges meant that the responsibility for bringing up children was handed back to \nwomen (Schneider et al. 1995:9). \n4 H\u00f6hn and Dorbritz (1995) saw the continuing strength of the institution of marriage in West Germany as the \nkey factor for the polarization process, providing a secure living arrangement for women and children. The \nstrong support of the state for marriages made other living arrangements with children less desirable, and \nmade the consequences of divorce more serious. \nHenz: Gender roles and values of children \nFigure 1: Total fertility rates in East and West Germany \n0.00\n0.50\n1.00\n1.50\n2.00\n2.50\n3.00\n19\n50\n19\n55\n19\n60\n19\n65\n19\n70\n19\n75\n19\n80\n19\n85\n19\n90\n19\n95\n20\n00\n20\n05\nWest\nEast\n \n \nSource: Statistisches Bundesamt 2007 \n \n \n3.2 Gender division of household work \nThe majority of both East and West-German couples followed a traditional division of \nhousehold work (Keddi and Seidenspinner 1991; Dannenbeck et al. 1995). Analyses of \nthe 1988 FS for West Germany have shown that shopping for the household, cleaning, \ncooking, childcare, contact with teachers and eldercare were predominantly female \nactivities whereas men were responsible for small repairs in the household and \ndecorating the apartment or house (Keddi and Seidenspinner 1991). Both partners \nplayed about equally often with children, kept social contacts, looked after finances and \ndealt with authorities. Women spent on average considerably more hours doing \nhousehold work.  \nIn the GDR, women also had the primary responsibility for the family (Strohmeier \nand Schulze 1995). Men carried out about one quarter of household tasks with younger \nmen doing more (Bertram 1995). Using FS data from 1988 and 1990, Dannenbeck and \nhis co-authors (1995) found very similar patterns in East and West Germany in terms of \nthe hours of household work. There were small differences regarding who carried out \nthe different household tasks. In the Eastern states there was a somewhat higher \ntendency to carry out tasks together or to take turns, which the authors explained with \nthe shortage of convenience goods in the planned economy of the GDR at the same \n1458  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 39 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 1459 \ntime as both partners typically worked full time, leaving couples with a considerable \norganisatory burden when carrying out subsidiary family tasks.  \nThere are rather few studies of whether and how the division of household work \nchanges over different life stages. In West Germany, childless couples who lived in \nnon-marital cohabitations followed a more equal division of household work than \ncouples in marital unions before they also adapted a more traditional model of \nhousehold work when a child was born (Keddi and Seidenspinner 1991). There \nremained, however, a gradual difference in the distribution of household work between \ncouples that had directly married and couples that had cohabited before getting married. \nMost of this research has been based on cross-sectional data, which means that any \ndiscrepancies between different life stages could actually be cohort effects. However, \nthe few longitudinal studies that have traced the division of household work of couples \nover their life course tend to support the cross-sectional findings that women but not \nmen increased their hours of household work when the couple had a child (for West \nGermany: Schulz and Blossfeld 2006; Grunow et al. 2007; for Sweden: Flood and \nGr\u00e5sj\u00f6 1997; Evertsson and Nermo 2007; for the US: Sanchez and Thomson 1997). \n \n \n3.3 Values of children \nEarlier analyses of the FS have identified three dimensions of values of children, \nlabelled as \u2018children as meaning of life\u2019, \u2018children as burden\u2019 and \u2018children as utility\u2019 \n(Bertram 1991, 1992). A related study of Bavarian women found four factors, dividing \nthe \u2018burden\u2019 into the \u2018material, psychic and social costs of children\u2019 and \u2018opportunity \ncosts of children\u2019 (Nauck 1993).  \nOne can assume that in the years after re-unification, East Germans\u2019 values of \nchildren were still predominantly based on their experience in the GDR because of the \nlaggardness of attitudes. Facilitators and constraints to having children should, \nhowever, have become more similar to those in the West. One would then expect that \nEast Germans considered the affective value of children more highly because it has \nbeen argued that primary group ties were more important in East Germany (hypothesis \n1). Many researchers claim that the nuclear family played a special role in East \nGermany because of the lack of alternatives to family life (Gysi 1989; Bertram 1995; \nHuinink and Wagner 1995; Schneider et al. 1995). One would also expect that the \naffective value of children was appreciated more by women than by men in East and \nWest Germany (hypothesis 2) because having children is a more important aspect of \nfemale identity. Because women tend to have closer long-term emotional bonds with \ntheir children than men, children might also have a higher emotional utility for mothers \nthan for fathers. From the perspective of men one can also argue that they have other \nHenz: Gender roles and values of children \n1460  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org \nmeans of achieving a sense of accomplishment, for example through a career, whereas \nwomen either do not have a career or they might get less satisfaction from a career if \nthey have it. The latter should be true for women who have chosen their occupation in \nanticipation of motherhood, which often leads to marginal positions in the labour \nmarket. Women who have been rather indifferent towards children should have invested \nmore in their education and career, and embarked on careers similar to those of men. If \nwomen get less satisfaction from a career than men, one should also find a difference in \nthe value of children expressed by women who have a career compared to those who \nhave not (hypothesis 2a). Some earlier research supports the hypothesis. In an analysis \nof a question about the joy that children give, women agreed more often than men, and \nwomen in East Germany more often fully agreed than women in the West (Dannenbeck \net al. 1995).  \n \nFigure 2: Hypotheses about the values of children in East and West Germany \n1. The affective value of children was higher among East than West \nGermans. \n2. The affective value of children was higher for women than for men. \n2a. Women with a successful labour-market career had a lower \naffective value of children than other women.  \n3. Women rated the costs of children higher than men did.  \n4. The opportunity costs of children were rated higher in West than in \nEast Germany.  \n5. Women endorsed more strongly the opportunity costs of children \nthan men, especially in West Germany. \n6. The insurance value of children was higher among East Germans \nthan among West Germans.  \n7. The insurance value of children was higher among parents with \nfewer individual resources.  \n \nFurther important differences between East and West Germany could be found in \nthe context opportunities and restrictions. The third hypothesis suggests that women \nmore often than men acknowledged high costs of children as they usually took over the \nlion share of the additional work in the home. Another expectation is that East Germans \nperceived the opportunity costs of children to be lower than West Germans (hypothesis \n4). Child-care arrangements made it easier in the GDR than in the FRG to combine \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 39 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 1461 \n                                                          \nchildren with employment. There were hardly any income-related opportunity costs for \nbringing up children. Individual life plans where family and children would be a \nrestraint or an obstacle were extremely limited in the GDR (Huinink 1995). Indeed, \nEast Germans agreed less with the notion that children are a burden than West Germans \n(Bien 1996). Hypothesis 5 states that women experienced higher opportunity costs of \nchildren than men, especially West-German women who wanted to have a career. Both \nNauck (1993) and Bertram (1991) report findings in line with this presumption for West \nGermany. \nHypothesis 6 proposes that the insurance utility of children might have been more \nvalued by East Germans. On the one hand, this could be a correlate of the closer family \nties in East Germany if they were associated with expectations about reciprocity. On the \nother hand, both parts of Germany had developed systems of state care for the elderly \nthat complemented the informal care provided by the family. In West Germany, there \nwas a small private market for care, whereas private care hardly existed in East \nGermany. A direct comparison shows that slightly more frail East Germans relied on \ninformal care by a family member or a friend.5 Indeed, Bien (1996) reported that East \nGermans agreed more than West Germans with statements about the usefulness of \nchildren. Finally, I want to take up the more general hypothesis that the insurance value \nof children was higher among parents with fewer individual resources (hypothesis 7) as \nsuggested by Nauck (2001). This is partly supported by Bertram\u2019s (1991) finding that \npeople with lower educational levels or from lower social strata emphasized more often \nthe insurance utility of children.  \nAlthough the hypotheses have been motivated with general East-West differences, \nthey will be tested for the more specific population of childless people living with a \npartner. The group is more extreme in East Germany than in West Germany. Issues of \nselectivity in this sub-group will be discussed in the methods section. \n \n \n3.4 Attitudes to women\u2019s employment \nResearch about attitudes to women\u2019s employment has focused on two aspects: the \nconsequences of women\u2019s employment for the family and children and on gender-role \n5 This is based on own evaluations of the Eurobarometer 1992 survey (Reif and Melich 1992). Among the \nfrail elderly people who received some form of help, 89% of West Germans and 95% of East Germans \nreceived informal care, and 3% of West Germans received public care compared to 8% of East Germans. \nOnly 2% of East Germans received help from privately paid carers compared to 15% of West Germans.  \nHenz: Gender roles and values of children \n1462  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org \nideology (Alwin et al. 1992; Braun et al. 1994; Braun and Borg 1997; Knudsen and \nWaerness 2001). West Germany emerged as a country that preferred a primarily \nfamilial role of women, especially when pre-school children were present (Alwin et al. \n1992). The East-West German comparison by Braun, Scott and Alwin (1994) suggested \nthat East Germans were more modern than West Germans with regard to the \nconsequences of women working, which the authors explained with the East-German \nnorm of a working mother and the availability of public child care. With regard to \ngender ideology, the two parts of Germany were quite similar, which has been put down \nto the way that emancipation had been decreed to GDR citizens by the state without \nmuch struggle by the citizens. Direct questions about the importance of work pointed to \nsome ambiguity (Braun et al. 1994:38). Braun and Borg (1997) diagnosed a tendency of \nWest Germans to regard female employment as luxury that can only be afforded when \nthe economy is booming.  \n \n \n3.5 Summary \nPrevious analyses of the division of housework suggest that in both parts of Germany \nthe family has not yet adapted the same level of gender equity as institutions of \neducation and employment. Studies of the values of children in both regions are \npointing to several potential differences with the possibility of a higher significance of \nchildren in East Germany compared to West Germany. Most previous comparisons of \nthe values of children were based on single items. The following analyses will identify \nbroader dimensions of values and children and compare them between East and West \nGermans.  \n \n \n4. Data and methods \n4.1 Sample \nThe following analyses are based on the German survey of \u2018Change and Development \nof Family Life Forms\u2019 (Familiensurvey, FS), which has been carried out on behalf of \nthe German Youth Institute. Table 1 gives an overview over the structure of the survey \nand the sample sizes of its different parts. The aim of the survey was to study changes \nin family values in the wake of increasing individualization. Its special feature lies in \ncombining a rich set of attitudinal questions, which were repeated over time for part of \nthe sample, with retrospective family and employment histories. Having been planned \noriginally only for West Germany, the 1988 survey was repeated in the East-German \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 39 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 1463 \nstates in 1990 with rather few modifications. For the 1994 wave, the aim of re-\ninterviewing the East-German participants of the 1990 survey had to be given up. For \nWest Germany, the panel was supplemented with an additional sample to obtain a more \nrepresentative sample for the population in 1994.6 In 2000, a further panel wave with \noriginal respondents from 1988 was achieved in West Germany. It was supplemented \nby newly drawn samples of East and West Germans. \n \nTable 1: The German \u2018Change and Development of Family Life Forms\u2019 \nSurvey: sample sizes (N) and age ranges \nSurvey \nyear \nWest \npanel N \nAge range \nin panel \nWest \nsupplement N \nAge range \nsuppl. \nEast \nN \nAge range \nEast  \nTotal \n1988 10043 18 \u2013 55 -  -  10043 \n1990 -  -  1951 18 \u2013 55 1951 \n1994 4997 24 \u2013 61 2002 18 \u2013 30 3995 18 \u2013 55 10994 \n2000 2002 30 \u2013 67 6613 18 \u2013 55 1478 18 \u2013 55 10093 \n \nSource: Bender, Bien & Alt (1996); Infratest Burke Sozialforschung (2000); Alt (1991). \n \nAll sub-samples of the 1988, 1990 and 1994 samples were probability samples. \nThe 1988 survey consisted of two separate samples with response rates of 55% and \n51% (Bender et al. 1996:274). The 1990 survey was carried out in the confusion after \nthe fall of the iron curtain, which led to a response rate of just 39%. The 1994 survey \nconsisted of three separate samples with response rates of 56.2% (West panel), 58.6% \n(East) and 58.8% (West, 18-30 year old). In 2000, the panel part had a response rate of \n53% (Infratest Burke Sozialforschung 2000). The new participants of the 2000 survey \nwere found via a modified random-route method where the flexible use of quotas for \nthe selection of household members at the sampled addresses precluded the calculation \nof a response rate (Infratest Burke Sozialforschung 2000). Weights have been provided \nfor most survey parts to help achieving representative data for the German population in \nthe survey year. No weights have been calculated for the 1990 sample. There is some \nevidence of bias in the panel (Bender et al. 1996), most importantly an under-\nrepresentation of people living in cities, of single people, and of single-person \n                                                          \n6 The additional sample of 18-30 year old Germans was necessary not only to correct for panel attrition but \nalso to capture the considerable migration between East and West since the fall of the iron curtain. \nHenz: Gender roles and values of children \n1464  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org \n                                                          \nhouseholds. I address this issue by controlling for respondents living in a city in 1988. \nThe other main threats do not apply because my study is limited to couples.  \nThe analyses are based on weighted data where possible. However, the software \nAMOS that I used for the confirmatory factor analysis does not accept weighted data. \nThis should not seriously affect the results because, when comparing exploratory factor \nanalyses from weighted and unweighted versions of the data, the results hardly differ. \nSimilarly, the Cox model cannot be estimated from weighted data.  \nThe study focuses on childless couples\u2019 attitudes and the influence of these \nattitudes on the rate of first birth.  A couple is classified as \u2018childless\u2019 if the respondent \nhad no own children at the time of the interview, and no children of the partner were \nliving with the couple.7 The asymmetry of the question means that some \u2018childless\u2019 \ncouples included a partner who had a child from a previous relationship, a situation \nwhich should have been more common among female respondents. In the 1988 and \n1990 surveys but not in the later surveys one can tentatively identify couples who were \ninvoluntarily childless.8 These couples will be excluded from some of the analyses. \nThe analysis is restricted to childless couples living together with the respondent \nbeing at most 40 years old, leaving 40 East-German men, 45 East-German women, 484 \nWest-German men and 543 West-German women in the unweighted sample for the \nanalysis. The differences in sample sizes reflect the different sizes of the overall East \nand West samples and also genuine differences in the populations. Because the age at \nfirst birth was very low in East Germany, most East-German respondents in the sample \nwere late in forming a family compared to their peers. Difficulties of access to housing \nfor childless couples in the GDR might be another reason for the small size of this \ngroup. Genuine differences between the populations are also reflected in the different \nshares of respondents indicating that the couple might be infertile, which is double as \nhigh among childless East-German men and women compared to West-German men \nand women, respectively, although the difference is not statistically significant.9  \nI considered two strategies for boosting the East-German sample. Because \nchildless couples had difficulties to get access to housing one could argue that childless \n7 The original question in the 1988 and 1990 survey was: \u2018Do you or did you have any children? I am \ninterested in your own, step, foster and adopted children as well as the children of your partner, those who \nlive with you\u2019. In the 1994 survey, the qualification \u2018those who lived with you\u2019 was omitted.  \n8 The corresponding self-completion question asked: \u2018Do you or your partner use a contraceptive regularly?\u2019, \nand for those who answered in the negative a follow-up question about the reason offered the pre-coded \nanswer: \u2018Because of biological or medical reasons not necessary\u2019. \n9 The lack of significance is presumably due to the small number of cases. Overall, 4.6 per cent of childless \ncouples indicated fertility problems. \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 39 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 1465 \n                                                          \nEast-German couples living apart together should also be included in the analyses. \nHowever, the division of household work, a key variable in the study, differed strongly \nbetween childless couples living together and those living apart. Another way of \nboosting the East-German sample was to include the 1994 East-German sample in the \nanalysis. This strategy is justified if changes between 1990 and 1994 were small \ncompared to the East-West differences. Therefore, the analysis of attitudinal data will \nbe based on the 1988 West-German sample and the combined 1990 and 1994 East-\nGerman samples.10 The resulting East-German sample of childless respondents aged 40 \nor younger living with a partner comprises 133 men and 167 women. Because infertility \ninformation is not available for the 1994 sample, all childless couples remain in the \nanalysis irrespective of potential infertility issues. After excluding respondents with \nmissing values of children the sample comprises 469 West-German men, 528 West-\nGerman women, 132 East-German men and 166 East-German women. \nBy focusing on childless couples the analyses address a part of the population that \nheld less favourable values of children than people who were already parents. \nTherefore, the results of this study cannot be generalized to the whole German \npopulation. A slightly different question is whether the selected group might be more \nextreme in East Germany than in West Germany in terms of their values of children. \nAlthough there is no final answer to this question, examining the responses to the value-\nof-children items suggests that, compared to the whole East and West-German \npopulations, the drop in appreciation of children by childless couples is about the same \nin East and West Germany. \nThe rest of the paper concerns only childless people who lived with a partner. \nWhenever I refer to East or West Germans from here on it is short for \u2018childless East or \nWest Germans who lived with a partner and were at most 40 years old\u2019.   \n \n \n4.2 Core variables \n4.2.1 Values of children \nRespondents were asked to indicate their level of agreement or disagreement with 13 \nitems (see Figure 3) by selecting one of four answers: \u2018Strongly agree\u2019, \u2018Agree\u2019, \n10 I do not include the 1994 West-German sample because of its panel structure. \nHenz: Gender roles and values of children \n1466  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org \n\u2018Disagree\u2019, \u2018Strongly disagree\u2019.11 The answers are coded so that high values indicate \nagreement with the item. \n \nFigure 3: Items about the values of children in the FS \n0.

The \nassumption is more problematic for childless couples whose household division of \nlabour was more equitable because previous research suggests that many of these \ncouples will change towards a more traditional division of labour when they have a \nchild. This should be especially true for (West) Germany with its lack of institutional \nsupport for parents after childbirth and its policies that are directed towards a gendered \ndivision of childcare. It is unclear to which extent couples anticipate this change. There \nis some evidence that a couple\u2019s household division of labour prior to having a child \ncontinues to exert some effect on the division of labour after childbirth (Sanchez and \nThomson 1997; Schulz and Blossfeld 2006). Therefore, the anticipated gender division \nof household work after childbirth in couples that are sharing rather equitably will be \neither of two scenarios: a pronounced change towards a more traditional division of \ndomestic labour with the associated threat of the woman\u2019s economic dependency, or a \nstruggle to continue an equitable arrangement with the possible associated stress within \nthe partnership. \nThe survey provides subjective reports about the division of household work by \nthe respondents from reporting \u2018how the tasks are divided in your marriage or \npartnership\u2026Which one of you does the majority of a particular task?\u2019 The tasks \ncovered in all surveys are: \n \n\u2022 Shopping for the household \n\u2022 Cleaning \n\u2022 Cooking \n\u2022 Caring for an ill or elderly family member \n\u2022 Small repairs in the household \n\u2022 Taking care of finances \n \nand two items about childcare that are not relevant for this analysis. The pre-coded \nresponse options were \u2018I myself\u2019, \u2018Partner\u2019, \u2018Take turns\u2019, \u2018Together\u2019, \u2018Each his own\u2019, \nHenz: Gender roles and values of children \n1468  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org \n                                                          \n\u2018Does not apply\u2019. For deriving a summarizing measure for the distribution of household \nwork I followed the logic of Ahrne and Roman\u2019s classification (Ahrne and Roman \n1997:28) and took only the three most demanding tasks from the list into account: \nshopping, cleaning and cooking.12 I distinguish five types of partnerships.13 In role-\nchanged partnerships, the man does more household work than the woman. In equal \npartnerships, there is an equal division of household work; all three tasks are shared \nequally, or each partner does the majority of one task and the third task is shared. In \nsemi-equal relationships, the man does quite a lot of household work but the woman has \nthe main responsibility and carries out more work. They consist of partnerships where \nthe spouses equally share two tasks and the woman carries out the majority of the third \ntask, or where the woman carries out the majority of two tasks and the man of one. The \nfourth type of partnership is called conventional and captures couples where the woman \ndoes the majority of two tasks whereas the third task is shared between the spouses. \nFinally, in patriarchal relationships the woman carries out the majority of all three \ntasks.  \nIn the FS respondents have not reported the actual hours spent on each task. By \nrestricting the measure to the three most prominent tasks, I prevented rare or less \ndemanding tasks from having an undue impact on the classification. When comparing \nthe distribution of household work as reported by male and female respondents, one \nfinds the well-known pattern of men and women over-estimating their own contribution \n(Keddi and Seidenspinner 1991; Dannenbeck 1992). The discrepancy in spouses\u2019 \nreporting is not yet well understood (Booth and Welch 1978; Marini and Shelton 1993) \nbut it has been linked to social desirability (Kamo 2000). When interpreting the \nanalyses one needs to bear in mind that the reported contributions to household work \nare not necessarily the true behaviour but reflect the respondent\u2019s subjective view \n(H\u00f6pflinger 1986). \n \n \n12 The selection of these three tasks is based on the average time-use by day as reported in the Time-Budget \nStudy of the German Statistical Office (Statistisches Bundesamt 2004:637). \n13 It was necessary to modify Ahrne and Roman\u2019s categories because they would not lead to a coherent and \nexhaustive classification when using the FS. Most importantly, I added a category for the man doing more \nhousework than the woman. \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 39 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 1469 \n all.  \n                                                          \n4.2.3 Attitudes to women\u2019s employment \nThe 1988 and 1990 surveys did not include a general item about the importance of paid \nwork for the respondent. I used the related question: \u2018What role do you think \nemployment plays in a relationship or marriage?... Which do you personally believe is \nthe correct solution \u2013 while there are no children? \u2013 while there is a child under 3? \u2013 \nwhile the youngest child is still of kindergarten age? \u2013 while the youngest child is still \nin school?\u2019 with possible responses \u2018Both should be fully employed\u2019, \u2018Both should be \nfully employed, but at a minimum one should only be part-time (the woman, the man, \ndepends on the situation, both)\u2019, \u2018One from both should not be employed (the woman, \nthe man)\u2019. I argue that a preference for the woman working even when a preschool \nchild is present captures to some degree the importance that the respondent attaches to \npaid work for the woman. I recoded the answers into four categories: a preference for a \nmother working full time14, part time, not at all, or \u2018gender neutral\u2019 if the respondent \ndid not indicate whether the man or the women should be working part time or who of \nthem should not be working at\n \n \n4.3 Methods and models \nThe paper contains three pieces of analysis. The next section gives the results of a \nconfirmatory factor analysis for the values of children. Then I test the hypotheses about \nthe values of children by regressing the predicted factor scores on selected respondent \ncharacteristics. These models also examine how closely the values of children are \nrelated to the household division of labour and the ideal hours of work for mothers of \npreschool children. Additional variables include age, which is measured at the time of \nthe interview minus 30, and dummy variables for the four groups of West and East-\nGerman men and women. The educational level is classified as low if the respondent \neither left school without qualification, with a lower secondary degree, or finished 8th \ngrade; it is coded as medium if the respondent obtained a middle level degree, obtained \na polytechnic entrance qualification, or finished 10th grade; and it is coded as high if the \nrespondent obtained a university entrance qualification. I use a combined measure of \nlabour-market participation and education as a proxy for alternative resources for \nachieving a sense of accomplishment. The set of dummy variables indicates whether the \n14 This category includes the n=56 cases in the 1988\/1990 surveys where respondents said that the man should \nnot be working but were not asked to specify the ideal working hours for the mother. \nHenz: Gender roles and values of children \n1470  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org \n                                                          \nrespondent held a job at the interview, and if so his or her highest level of education. A \nhigh level of education should be associated with a high level of individual resources \nthat allow for other ways of achieving a sense of accomplishment. \nFinally, I will examine the importance of these attitudes for the propensity of \nhaving a first child in West Germany by estimating a Cox model. All covariates are \nmeasured at the 1988 interview and do not change over time. The information about a \ncouple\u2019s childbearing after the 1988 survey is taken from the 1994 and, if available and \nnecessary, the 2000 interview. Only respondents who participated at least in the 1994 \ninterview could be included in the analysis. Of the 997 childless respondents who lived \nwith a partner in 1988, 455 were included in the 1994 panel, 406 providing valid \ninformation about the 1988 partnership.15 I take account of the bias in the 1994 panel \nwave by including an indicator for living in a city in 1988.16 The other known biases in \nthe 1994 sample \u2013 the under-representation of single people and single-person \nhouseholds \u2013 should not affect the analysis of couples\u2019 childbearing. The observation \nperiod starts in 1988 and ends either with the birth of the first child to the couple, their \ndate of separation, or the last interview date, whichever occurred first.  \nThe baseline duration is time until first birth since the 1988 interview. The \ncovariates include the duration of the partnership in 1988 in years as well as the \npartnership duration squared and divided by 100.17 His and her age are measured at the \n1988 interview in years minus 30. I also include his and her age minus 30 squared and \ndivided by 100 to capture non-linear effects of age. The dummy-variable \u2018city\u2019 \nindicates whether the respondent lived in a town with more than 100,000 inhabitants in \n1988. The survey did not collect information about partner\u2019s attendance of a \npolytechnic college or university, nor did it record changes in respondent\u2019s educational \nlevel by the time of the second interview. The survey does not provide employment \nhistories for partners. To obtain equivalent measures for respondents\u2019 and their \npartners\u2019 education and employment, I use the same combined variable of labour-force \nparticipation and education in 1988 as in the regression models. The further covariates \nlike the values of children, gender-division of household work and respondent\u2019s ideal \n15 Reasons for the loss of 49 cases are, on the one hand, inconsistencies in the partnership histories and, on the \nother hand, differences in identifying partnerships. The 1988 instructions asked respondents to report whether \nthey \u2018currently have a strong relationship\u2019, whereas the 1994 instructions asked them to report \u2018past \nrelationships that lasted at least for one year and were more than passing acquaintances or infatuations\u2019. \n16 Ideally the indicator would change over time because the bias is related to the 1994 place of living. \nHowever, the data do not include histories of geographical mobility. \n17 This date can differ from the year of first meeting the partner and the year of moving together. Because all \nthese dates are only reported in calendar years, the beginning of the partnership is set to the middle of the \nreported calendar year. \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 39 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 1471 \n                                                          \nworking time for mothers of pre-school children have been described earlier. However, \nthe values-of-children variables have been standardized to have means zero and \nvariances one so that their effects can be compared more easily. For men the value of \n\u2018Opportunity costs\u2019 is set to zero, the mean value for women. I also include interaction \neffects of the values of children with respondent\u2019s gender as well as interaction effects \nof the values of children with simplified versions of the ideal working hours for \nmothers and the division of household work. The model does not include variables for \nwhether and when a couple married because marriage is endogenous to both childbirth \nand the attitudes of interest.  \nAmong the 406 childless partnerships at the 1988 wave with some follow-up \ninformation and a female partner of at most 40 years of age, I identified 213 with a first \nchild after the 1988 survey and 193 who remained childless, using the information from \nthe 1994 and 2000 panels. After excluding 17 couples with infertility issues and further \ncouples with missing values for the covariates, 354 partnerships remained, reporting \n192 first births.18 \n \n \n5. Results \n5.1 Confirmatory factor analysis of the values of children \nBefore deriving scales for values of children I performed a confirmatory factor analysis \nto find out about similarities and differences in the structure of the values of children \nbetween East and West-German childless men and women (Long 1983; Lewis-Beck \n1994; Byrne 2001). The confirmatory factor analysis tests how well correlations of the \nitems about the values of children can be explained by a smaller set of factors. It also \nhelps to explore the meaning of the different items. Following Byrne (2001) I first tried \nto establish baseline models for the four different subgroups.19 When examining several \ngoodness-of-fit statistics, a three-factor model similar to the one referred to by Bertram \n(1991, 1992) was the best model for West-German men. For West-German women, a \nmodel with a separate factor capturing opportunity costs led to the best model fit. The \nthree-factor model has also been adopted for the two East-German groups. Although \n18 For the 406 couples, there are missing values for partner\u2019s age (n=5), division of household work (n=17), \nideal working hours for mothers (n=4), the combined employment and education variable for females (n=4) \nand males (n=6).  \n19 More details about the confirmatory factor analysis can be obtained from the author. \nHenz: Gender roles and values of children \n1472  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org \nbeing in each case the best model compared to plausible alternative models, only the \nmodel for East-German women achieved a satisfactory fit by conventional standards. \nHowever, as there were no obvious and theoretically founded model improvements for \nthe other groups I did not further modify the models.  \nThe next analytic step was to establish whether, apart from the fourth factor for \nWest-German women, the same factor structure holds for the four sub-groups. When \ntesting whether the same three-factor model holds for West-German men, East-German \nmen, and East-German women I found that the three factors can be assumed to have the \nsame factor loadings apart from three small differences. Item 12 (cf. Figure 2) loads \nhigher on the Costs factor for East-German women than for the other two groups. \nAlthough the opportunity costs do not form a separate factor for East-German women, \nthe issue of women combining children with a career is more closely related with the \ncosts of having children than for men. The other differences in the factor structure refer \nto two factor variances. A higher variance of Affection for West-German men and a \nlower variance of Utility for East-German men suggest a more heterogeneous \nperception of the Affection value among West-German men and a more homogenous \nperception of the Utility aspect among East-German men than in the other groups, \nrespectively. \n \nTable 2: Factor score weights based on final models in the appendix  \nFigures A1 to A4 \n Costs O-Costs \n voc01 voc03 voc06 voc04 voc07 voc09 voc12 \nWest Men       \nCosts .132 .148 .169 .151 .143 .040 .021 \nUtility .003 .004 .004 .004 .004 .001 .001 \nAffection -.012 -.014 -.015 -.014 -.013 -.004 -.002 \nEast Men       \nCosts .138 .171 .130 .189 .121 .044 .020 \nUtility .009 .011 .008 .012 .008 .003 .001 \nAffection -.018 -.022 -.017 -.024 -.016 -.006 -.003 \nWest Women       \nO-costs .032 .034 .039 .030 .040 .159 .131 \nCosts .130 .137 .159 .123 .164 .044 .036 \nUtility .005 .006 .006 .005 .007 .008 .007 \nAffection -.016 -.017 -.020 -.015 -.020 .004 .003 \nEast Women       \nCosts .137 .132 .157 .156 .121 .048 .058 \nUtility .006 .005 .006 .006 .005 .002 .002 \nAffection -.016 -.015 -.018 -.018 -.014 -.006 -.007 \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 39 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 1473 \nTable 2: (continued) \n Utility   Affection \n voc02 voc10 voc11 voc00 voc05 voc08 \nWest Men      \nCosts .003 .008 -.009 -.032 -.019 -.037 \nUtility .187 .433 .102 .014 .008 .016 \nAffection .005 .012 .074 .222 .132 .255 \nEast Men      \nCosts .010 .016 -.008 -.047 -.038 -.054 \nUtility .179 .305 .084 .061 .048 .069 \nAffection .024 .041 .054 .180 .143 .206 \nWest Women      \nO-costs .007 .013 .004 .011 .002 .007 \nCosts .006 .011 -.009 -.066 -.013 -.042 \nUtility .210 .406 .086 .044 .009 .028 \nAffection .012 .023 .044 .246 .049 .157 \nEast Women      \nCosts .006 .013 -.007 -.048 -.042 -.044 \nUtility .193 .452 .076 .033 .029 .030 \nAffection .011 .026 .045 .203 .179 .188 \n \nIn the next step, I added West-German women to the analysis, postulating a fourth \nfactor \u2018Opportunity costs\u2019 for this group and excluding the respective items from the \nCost factor. After allowing for different loadings of items 0 and 5 (cf. Figure 2) on the \nAffection factor for West-German women, the four-group model achieved an overall \nacceptable fit. The estimated parameters \u2013 factor loadings, factor variances and factor \ncorrelations \u2013 of the final model are displayed in the appendix (Figures A1 to A4).   \nThe similarities and differences between the groups also appear in the factor score \nweights that are used to predict the factor values from the observed variables. They are \ngiven in Table 2. Apart from the opportunity-cost items, all indicators that load on the \nCost factor have factor scores of the same order of magnitude in all four subgroups. \nExcept for West-German women, the items that capture the opportunity costs of \nchildren (items 9 and 12) contribute rather little to the perceived values of children. The \nsense of being needed (item 5) plays quite a small role in calculating the Affective \nfactor for West-German women, especially if compared to East-German women. \n\u2018Bringing partners closer\u2019 (item 11) bears rather little relationship with the Affective \nand the Utility dimensions of having children, indicating a certain ambiguity of the \nitem. Children being useful mean in all groups that one can rely on them in an \nemergency; all other items are less important for this factor. \nHenz: Gender roles and values of children \n1474  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org \nTo sum up, the models identify three or four separate dimensions of the values of \nchildren for men and women. The factors Affection and Utility are shared by all groups \nin the analysis and load on the same indicators. However, the values of children differ \nin some aspects between the four groups. Most important is the separate factor for \nWest-German women for the opportunity costs of children, reflecting the more serious \nconsequences of children for women\u2019s employment. The most ambiguous item in the \nanalysis is \u2018Bring partners closer\u2019, which respondents interpreted in different ways, and \nwhich does not load strongly on any factor. As the item is one of two that could be \ninterpreted as indicators of children\u2019s social value, one can speculate whether including \nmore items for this dimension would bring out the additional theoretically expected \nfactor.  \nIn conclusion, the factor structure of the values of children is equivalent in all \ngroups apart from West-German women. There is partial measurement invariance of the \nAffection and the Costs factors, but the differences are actually few. In the following \nanalyses I assume that the factors Affection and Utility are equivalent for all groups, \nand that the Cost factor is the same for both groups of men. However, some cautionary \nnotes are warranted. The small East-German samples did not allow testing the model on \na new sample. Therefore, the results are only exploratory. Furthermore, the small East-\nGerman samples provide limited power for detecting significant differences in the East-\nWest comparisons.  \n \n \n5.2 Variations in the values of children between East and West-German women \nand men \nTable 3 gives the mean values of the factors and the corresponding 95 per cent \nconfidence intervals for the four groups. High values indicate an endorsement of the \nrespective factor. West-German men show a polarized pattern with on average the \nhighest Affection scores among the four groups, the lowest Utility scores and the \nhighest scores on the Cost factor. West-German women have similar Cost and Utility \nscores but they appreciate least of the four groups the affective value of children. Their \ncost assessment does not include the opportunity costs. East-German men and women \nscore quite similarly on all scales, expressing medium affective values, high utility \nvalues and low perceived costs of children.  \nBy comparing the means I can test some of the earlier hypotheses about \ndifferences in the values of children. Neither hypothesis 1 nor the general part of \nhypothesis 2 is unambiguously supported. Testing hypothesis 3 is difficult because of \nthe separate Opportunity-cost factor for West-German women, but there is some \nsupport for this hypothesis among East Germans. Hypotheses 4 and 5 cannot be tested \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 39 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 1475 \ndirectly, but the factor score weights for items 9 and 12 could suggest that the perceived \nopportunity costs were especially high among West-German women. Hypothesis 6 is \nsupported. \n \nTable 3: Average value-of-children factor scores and 95 per cent confidence \nintervals by gender and region \nFactor  West Men West Women East Men East Women \nAffection Mean 2.2 1.7 2.0 2.1 \n 95% CI 2.15 \u2013 2.21 1.63 \u2013 1.68 1.95 \u2013 2.05 2.06 \u2013 2.15 \nUtility Mean 1.9 2.0 2.3 2.3 \n 95% CI 1.89 \u2013 1.99 1.98 \u2013 2.07 2.26 \u2013 2.38 2.25 \u2013 2.41 \nCosts Mean 1.6 1.5 1.1 1.3 \n 95% CI 1.57 \u2013 1.65 1.49 \u2013 1.57 1.00 \u2013 1.13 1.22 \u2013 1.35 \nOpportunity Mean  1.4   \nCosts 95% CI  1.42 \u2013 1.46   \n \nNote: Weighted data.  \n \nHypotheses 2a, 5 and 7 refer to variations in the values of children by individual \nresources and by the woman having a career. To put them to the test I regressed the \ndifferent factor scores onto individual respondent characteristics. In addition, the \nregression models test whether hypotheses 1 to 7 hold net of age, and whether the \nvalues of children vary with the gender-division of household work and with attitudes \nto mothers\u2019 employment. The distributions of these variables are given in Table 4, \nshowing some pronounced differences among the four groups. Considerably fewer East \nGermans than West Germans in the selected sample were in the labour market, and very \nfew East Germans who were employed or self-employed had a low level of education. \nThis skewed pattern is the combined result of differences in peoples\u2019 educational \nattainment in East and West and several selection processes. Overall, fewer East \nGermans than West Germans have left school with a low level of education; more of \nthem obtained a middle-level educational degree instead.20 Selecting childless couples \nmeans for all subgroups a drop of the share of people with low education in favour of \nthe share of people with a medium level education (especially in the East) or a high \nlevel of education (especially in the West). Selecting childless couples means for West \n                                                          \n20 When looking at the total sample, 49 per cent of West-German men and women compared to 17 per cent of \nEast-German men and 19 per cent of East-German women have a low level of education. A similar though \nsomewhat less extreme pattern has been reported in German official statistics (Statistisches Bundesamt 2000). \nHenz: Gender roles and values of children \n1476  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org \nGermany also a drop of the share of people who are not employed (especially strong for \nwomen) and for East Germany an increase of this share.  \n \nTable 4: Distributions of core independent variables (per cent) \n West Men \n(N=483) \nWest Women \n(N=510) \nEast Men \n (N=162) \nEast Women \n(N=155) \nEducation & Employment    \n    Not (self-) employed 14.9 19.7 26.9 32.8 \n    (Self-)employ. & low education  35.6 27.8 2.1 0.6 \n    (Self-)employ. & medium educ. 30.3 38.2 52.5 49.8 \n    (Self-)employ. & high education 19.2 14.4 18.4 16.9 \nDivision of household work     \n    Role change 9.6 6.9 6.6 4.5 \n    Equal 30.5 22.4 20.2 18.6 \n    Semi-equal 24.2 26.2 27.1 30.1 \n    Conservative 20.7 18.9 26.4 30.4 \n    Patriarchal 14.9 25.7 19.7 16.4 \nIdeal employment for mothers of \npreschool children \n \n   \n    Full time 2.1 2.5 26.5 21.6 \n    Part time 32.2 33.0 43.0 42.1 \n    Not working 37.6 32.7 13.9 8.4 \n    Gender neutral  28.0 31.8 16.6 27.9 \n \nNote: Weighted data \n \nThe division of household work shows a similar pattern for East-German men and \nwomen whereas West-German men report a rather high share of equal partnerships and \nWest-German women report a rather high share of patriarchal partnerships.21 One also \nfinds large regional differences in the ideal working hours for mothers of pre-school \nchildren especially in the categories of full-time work and not working. Except of East-\nGerman men, large shares of the sample gave a gender-neutral answer concerning \nwhether the man or the woman should work part time or stay at home to care for the \nchild. As the variable is used to capture respondent\u2019s attitude to women\u2019s careers, I \ninterpret this specific category as comprising respondents who tend to support women\u2019s \ncareers depending on the specific circumstances. East and West-German men and \n                                                          \n21 Cooke (2006 ) observed a similar pattern in a recent analysis of 1994 ISSP data. \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 39 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 1477 \n                                                          \nwomen also differ somewhat by age at the interview (not shown) with average ages in \nthe weighed sample being 29.3 for West-German men, 27.1 for West-German women, \n27.6 for East-German men and 26.1 for East-German women.  \nThe regression results are presented in Table 5. The older the respondents are, the \nless prevalent are the Affective and Utility values of children and the more they \nemphasize the Cost aspect of children except Opportunity costs for West-German \nwomen, where there is no variation with age. The net differences in values of children \nby region and by gender show the same rank orders as the gross differences in Table 3. \nBoth on the Affective and the Utility dimensions respondents with a job and a low level \nof education score highest. The same pattern holds if one carries out the analysis \nseparately for men and women (not shown). These findings lend partial support to \nhypotheses 2a and 7.  \nOverall the Affective value of children does not vary with the division of \nhousehold work. However, when I estimate the effects of the division of household \nwork separately for men and women, I find that an equal division of household work is \nassociated with a significantly lower Affective value for women whereas it exerts no \ninfluence on men\u2019s Affection score.22 The perceived Utility of children is associated \nnegatively with an equal or semi-equal division of household work. One can explain \nthis as either being an indicator of less traditional values, emphasizing instead \nchildren\u2019s independence and their right to their own lives, or of a high confidence of \ncouples who share their household work equally that they can support each other \nwithout having to rely on their children. A semi-equal or equal division of household \nwork is also associated with lower perceived Costs of children, possibly because the \ncouple expects to share the burden. The effects of the ideal working hours for mothers \nof pre-school children show the expected patterns but they are not associated with any \nsignificant differences in the predicted values of children except for the group of \nrespondents who postulate that men\u2019s and women\u2019s working hours are interchangeable. \nThe group consists of highly educated individuals; 40 per cent of them have passed the \nuniversity entrance exam. Among these non-traditional well-educated people there is \nlittle appreciation of the contributions of children to individual well-being. As the group \ndoes not score high on the Cost factor either, these people might best be described as \nhaving \u2018no attitude\u2019 to children.  \n \n22 The coefficient for \u2018Equal division of household work\u2019 is -.085 and its interaction effect with being male is \n.104. \nHenz: Gender roles and values of children \n1478  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org \nTable 5: OLS Regression of factor scores on respondent characteristics \n Affective Utility  Costs  Opportun. costs \n Coeff.

The first \nmodel includes only some control variables. The first-birth risk increases with \npartnership duration to about five years and decreases thereafter. Also woman\u2019s age has \na non-linear effect with the risk increasing up to about age 24 and decreasing thereafter. \nThe male partner\u2019s age is not significant at the five percent level once the woman\u2019s age \nis taken into account.23 The indicator for living in a city controls for a possible selection \nbias in the panel. The first-birth risk is 23 per cent lower in cities than in smaller towns \nand villages, but the difference virtually disappears in the models that take other \ncharacteristics of the couple into account.  \nModel 2 adds the four factors of values of children to the model. Only one of them \nhas a significant effect on the first birth rate: the higher the Affective value of children, \nthe sooner the respondent has a child. Perceptions of the Costs of children or their \nUtility have no significant impact on the birth rate. Similarly the perceived Opportunity \ncosts do not influence the first-birth rate of West-German women. Model 3 shows that \nthe influence of the Affective value of children applies only to women. \nThe next models test whether other variables are confounded with the effect of the \nvalues of children. Model 4 takes into account whether the couple is in paid work and, \nif yes, their educational degrees. Women\u2019s occupational resources do not prove \nsignificant for the first birth rate but if the man does not hold a job the couple tends to \npostpone childbirth.  \nA strong predictor of first births turns out to be the division of household work. \nCouples where the man carries out more tasks than the woman and couples where both \npartners share the tasks equally or semi-equally have a much lower rate of first birth \nthan couples with a patriarchal division of household work. Finally, the respondent\u2019s \nideas about the ideal working hours for a mother of a pre-school child do not have any \nsignificant influence on the propensity of having a first child although the parameters \ndisplay the expected pattern. \n \n23 If I control for the couple\u2019s age difference instead of his age, the estimated effect is not significant either. \nHenz: Gender roles and values of children \n1480  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org \nTable 6: Results from Cox models for first birth in West-Germany; relative \nrisks \n (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) \nRespondent male 1.08 .70 .73 .71 .75 .75 \nPartnersh. duration (y.) 1.16 1.16 1.17 1.18\u2020 1.18\u2020 1.20\u2020 \nPart. dur. squared \/ 100 .23* .23* .21* .19* .18* .16** \nHer age (years) .88** .90** .90** .90** .89** .89* \nHer age squared \/ 100 .29** .31* .31* .30* .28** .27** \nHis age (years) 1.01 1.02 1.02 1.01 1.01 1.01 \nHis age squared \/ 100 .67\u2020 .69 .69 .76 .69 .71 \nLived in city .78\u2020 .88 .91 .91 .95 .95 \nValues of children       \nAffection  1.40* 2.16** 2.23** 2.21** 2.26** \nCosts  .94 .89 .92 .87 .85 \nUtility  1.01 .93 .90 .90 .90 \nOpportunity Costs  1.00 1.05 1.03 1.01 1.04 \nMen: Values of children       \nAffection   .53* .51* .50* .49* \nCosts   1.10 1.04 1.07 1.11 \nUtility   1.12 1.17 1.10 1.11 \nHer education and employment      \nNot (self-)employed    1.07 0.99 1.02 \n(Self-)employed & low \neducation (reference)    \n1 1 1 \n(Self-)empl. & med educ.    .95 .95 .94 \n(Self-)empl. & high educ.    1.25 1.21 1.21 \nHis education and employment      \nNot (self-) employed    .49* .53\u2020 .53\u2020 \n(Self-)employed & low \neducation (reference)    \n1 1 1 \n(Self-)empl. & med educ.    1.02 1.02 1.05 \n(Self-)empl. & high educ.    1.15 1.24 1.33 \nDivision of housework      \nRole change     .41** .40** \nEqual     .51** .49** \nSemi-equal     .56* .54** \nConservative     .66\u2020 .62* \nPatriarchal (reference)     1 1 \nIdeal working hours for mothers     \nFull time      .72 \nPart time      1.25 \nNo working (reference)      1 \nGender neutral      1.17 \n       \n-2 Loglikelihood0 2082.4      \n-2 Loglikelihood 2012.3 2000.2 1993.7 1985.6 1974.2 1972.1 \nDf 8 12 15 21 25 28 \n \nNote: ** p<0.01, * p<0.05, \u2020 p<0.10 \n \nThe sample size limits the possibility of testing for three-way interaction effects of \nvalues of children, the household division of labour and the ideal working hours for \nmothers, but several two-way interactions could be explored when some measures were \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 39 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 1481 \nsimplified. As patriarchal couples had considerably higher birth rates than all other \ntypes of couples, the models in Table 7 use a dichotomous variable for the division of \nhousehold work, contrasting patriarchal couples with all others. When measuring the \nideal working hours for mothers, the categories \u2018full time\u2019 and \u2018part time\u2019 have been \ncombined into \u2018working\u2019.

Model 4 shows the \ninteraction effects of the division of household work with the values of children. The \nestimated parameters suggest that the first-birth rate of couples who practise a \npatriarchal division of household work hardly depends on the values of children; they \nhave a high propensity of having a first child anyhow. The only exception is that they \npostpone the first birth if the woman considers the opportunity costs of children to be \nhigh. Turning to the other couples, their transition to having a first child varies \nespecially with the Affective value of children.

Summary and discussion \nThe theory of the Second Demographic Transition suggests that the values of children \nand gender roles independently affect first-birth rates once the economic circumstances \nof couples are taken into account. Before addressing this question, the first part of the \npaper has presented a comparative analysis of East and West Germans\u2019 values of \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 39 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 1483 \n                                                          \nchildren. The confirmatory factor analysis revealed strong similarities in the factor \nstructure of East and West-German men and women. In all groups I identified an \nAffective, a Utility and a Cost dimension of the values of children, each of which was \nlinked to about the same items in each group. The main exception was the additional \nOpportunity-costs factor for West-German women, pointing to differences in the \nperceptions of the consequences of having children for women\u2019s careers. A similar \ndifference was found by Liefbroer (2005) for Dutch women. Another special feature of \nthe factor structure for West-German women was the low association of the \u2018sense of \nbeing needed\u2019 with any factor, whereas it aligned with the affective dimension of \nhaving children in the other groups. Possibly, West-German women associate the item \nwith obligations rather than with emotional closeness. Altogether the factor structures \nwere similar enough to treat the three factors as equivalent in the later analyses. \nHowever, it is also important to note that the confirmatory factor analysis suffered from \nthe small East-German sample size even when using both 1990 and 1994 data for East \nGermany. It is possible that special structures of East-German values of children did not \nsurface clearly enough in the analysis to be distinguished from random error.  \nThe items included in the survey do not cover all aspects of the values of children \nthat have been discussed in the theoretically oriented literature, especially positive \nsocial aspects of having children. Some items have been interpreted by respondents in \ndifferent ways. Altogether the analysis calls for a clearer and more comprehensive set \nof items to measure the values of children in social surveys. Such a revision could also \ntry to further differentiate the items that capture the costs associated with children so \nthat different negative aspects of having children could be separated out more clearly in \naddition to the opportunity costs to women\u2019s careers.   \nWhen comparing the values of children between East and West-German men and \nwomen, several hypotheses about the values of children were not supported. Neither did \nI find a general regional difference in the Affective value nor any general gender \ndifference. The real surprise was the high level of Affection that West-German men \nhave expressed. The unexpected gender pattern is not entirely unusual. Liefbroer (2005) \nfound that women perceive bigger disadvantages and smaller advantages of having a \nchild than men. Using the concept of the \u2018centrality of children to one\u2019s life\u2019, Jones and \nBrayfield (1997) found in two out of six countries that women saw children as less \ncentral to their lives than men.24 To explain this, Jones and Brayfield pointed out the \n24 Jones and Brayfield (1997) measure the centrality of children by summing up the Likert scores for three \nitems: \u2018Watching children grow up is life\u2019s greatest joy\u2019, \u2018A marriage without children is not fully complete\u2019 \nand \u2018People who have never had children lead empty lives\u2019. \nHenz: Gender roles and values of children \n1484  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org \n                                                          \nimportance of national context for the expression of gender differences in attitudes to \nchildren. One could read the West-German results such that either women express \nrelatively low Affective values for children because they are aware of the negative \nconsequences of children for their life-styles; or that West-German men express \nrelatively high affective values in trying to live up to a new ideal of fatherhood. One \ncan also link the results for West-German men to a specific group of childless couples \nidentified by Onnen-Isemann (2003): couples that are childless despite having a strong \ntraditional family orientation. Onnen-Isemann speculated that these couples were \npostponing childbirth because they first tried to establish ideal conditions for bringing \nup a child in a traditional family. Childlessness results then from \u2018an exaggerated \nvaluation\u2019 of family and children (Onnen-Isemann 2003:131). \nThe hypothesis that people with fewer individual resources rank higher on the \nAffective scale turned out to be true for people with a low level of education who are in \nwork. It is in line with the theoretical argument that they have fewer alternative ways of \nachieving a sense of accomplishment. Similar findings have been reported in the studies \nby Hoffman, Thornton and Manis (1978) and Jones and Brayfield (1997). The \nhypothesis has not been supported for people without a job, which could be due to the \nheterogeneity of this group and its considerable share (45 per cent) of people with a \nhigh educational level.  \nThe next question addressed in the paper was how the values of children were \nrelated to some other attitudes that might also influence the propensity of having a \nchild. I found that couples with an equal or semi-equal division of household work \nperceived both the Utility and the Costs of children as lower than other couples. Only \nfor women there was an association with the Affective value of children: women who \nequally shared the household work with their partners had lower Affection scores than \nwomen with a patriarchal division of labour. The finding is similar to Jones and \nBrayfield\u2019s (1997) results and some of Bernhardt and Goldscheider\u2019s (2006) results for \nSweden. Both teams explained the findings as a consequence of the gender revolution, \nwhich led both to more liberal gender-role attitudes and to women and men becoming \nmore conscious of the conflicts associated with parenthood. In addition, egalitarian men \nwere less likely to anticipate the negative consequences of children in Bernhardt and \nGoldscheider\u2019s study, which the authors explained by gains in the financial stability in \ndual worker families.25  \n25 Men were classified as egalitarian in terms of both the couple\u2019s division of household work and labour-\nmarket participation. \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 39 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 1485 \nI did not find any significant effect of mothers\u2019 ideal working hours on the values \nof children although the estimated parameters followed the expected pattern. The \nvariable was used as a proxy for the importance attached to women being in paid work, \nand the proxy might not fully capture the construct. \nThe last piece of analysis has demonstrated the contribution of the values of \nchildren and gender roles to fertility studies. Even when socio-demographic \ncharacteristics of the couple were taken into account, ideational factors contributed to \nexplaining the propensity of having a child, confirming findings of Bernhardt and \nGoldscheider (2006) for Sweden, Liefbroer (2005) for the Netherlands and Moors \n(2008) for North-Rhine Westphalia. In the Cox model, women\u2019s Affective score was a \nstrong predictor of first births whereas male respondents\u2019 values of children did not \nexert any significant influence on the first-birth rate. Another important factor was the \nhousehold division of labour, although not in the hypothesized direction: compared to a \npatriarchal division of household work, an equal or semi-equal division of household \nwork was associated with a lower birth rate net of the values of children. For men the \nfinding is similar to the one by Bernhardt and Goldscheider (2006) that traditional men \nmade the transition to parenthood more rapidly than egalitarian men whereas, in \nBernhardt and Goldscheider\u2019s study, women\u2019s gender-role attitudes had little effect on \ntheir transition to parenthood.  \nMore importantly, the analyses have also illustrated how fertility behaviour results \nfrom the interplay of a variety of factors. Couples with a non-patriarchal arrangement of \nhousehold work have a rather low rate of childbirth but their behaviour is more \nheterogeneous, depending on the Affective value of children. The findings suggest that \nin West Germany there was a straightforward path to childbirth associated with the \ntraditional division of labour and supported by various societal institutions, and a more \nopen pathway that is associated with more equal gender roles and where attitudes to \nchildren come into play. The more varied pathways in the latter group might reflect that \ncouples with more equitable gender roles have more life-style options, or they might \nreflect the threat to the current division of labour in the partnership. A clearer \ninterpretation of the effects of gender roles on fertility decisions can be obtained by \nstudying their effects on the transition to second or higher-order births where alternative \nlife-style options for couples are rarer and where both partners are aware of the conflicts \nbetween having another child, paid work and leisure (Cooke 2004). For these reasons \neffects of gender roles are arguably stronger in transitions to second or higher order \nbirths.   \nThe findings of this study indicate, firstly, in the context of McDonald\u2019s approach, \nthat in a society that lacks gender-equal family-oriented institutions, traditional gender \nroles as reflected in the division of household work are still a very attractive \nenvironment for bringing up children. Secondly, in non-patriarchal couples, values of \nHenz: Gender roles and values of children \n1486  http:\/\/www.demographic-research.org \nchildren, and especially women\u2019s values of children, play an additional role. This could \nmean that a high Affective value of children encourages women in non-patriarchal \npartnerships to have children despite the threat of economic dependency or potential \nstress in their partnership. Women in non-patriarchal partnerships who hold less \nfavourable values of children might find other life-styles more attractive. Thirdly, the \nperception of the Opportunity costs of having children was quite similar among women \nin patriarchal and non-patriarchal partnerships, but only for the earlier ones they slowed \ndown the birth rate. One can speculate that women in non-patriarchal partnerships are \nmore confident that they will be able to resume their careers after a period of time \nduring which they predominantly care for their children, perhaps because they count on \ntheir spouses\u2019 support. Finally, one can tentatively generalize that affective values of \nchildren matter especially in equitable couples, i.e. couples with a more equal division \nof household and market work (although the latter effect was not statistically significant \nat standard levels). One can assume that in these couples, the terms under which the \ncouple will have a child are carefully negotiated because having a child will make it \ndifficult to sustain the couple\u2019s division of household and market work. Both the stress \nof combining parenthood and employment and the risk of economic dependency are \nlikely to be higher for women. This is why women\u2019s affective values of children might \nmatter more than men\u2019s. \nOverall, the expectations about East-West differences received mixed support. The \nstructure of the values of children of childless East and West Germans was surprisingly \nsimilar. The only difference was the stronger perception of the Opportunity costs of \nchildren among West-German women, which one could expect from the different \nfamily policies in the GDR and the FRG. The high value of Affection by West-German \nmen was not expected and might indicate a change in their gender role. The \nexpectations about the low perceived Costs of children or their higher Utility among \nEast Germans were supported by the analyses and can be put down to the different \nfamily policies before 1990. As the perceived costs of children were lower among East \nGermans than among West Germans, it is not obvious that the difficulties of combining \nchildren and paid work were the main reason for the drop in fertility in East Germany \nafter 1990 to below the West-German level, as it has been suggested in the literature. \nAs far as their attitudes to children were concerned, East Germans might have had not \nyet fully recognized the costs of having children in the unified German society, or these \ncosts were rightly perceived to be lower than in West Germany because of the better \nsupply of childcare facilities for young children in East Germany, or because people\u2019s \nlife-styles had not yet adapted to the Western ones. The main reasons for the East-\nGerman drop in fertility must be located elsewhere, for example in the extraordinary \nexperience of profound societal change and uncertainty in East Germany (Kreyenfeld \n2008).  \nDemographic Research: Volume 19, Article 39 \nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org 1487 \nIt was not possible to examine the effects of the values of children on first-birth \nrates in East Germany. As the values of children were rather similar among East-\nGerman men and women, the effects of men\u2019s and women\u2019s values of children on first-\nbirth rates might also have been similar, in contrast to West Germany. If the West-\nGerman findings suggest that affective values of children mattered especially in more \nequitable couples, one might expect that they were also important in East Germany \nwhere somewhat fewer couples practised a patriarchal division of household work and \nwhere mothers were normally expected to participate in paid work. In more equitable \npartnerships the terms of having a child are more likely to be the subject of \nnegotiations, and once the negotiation started, it might not be sufficient for having a \nchild to perceive the costs of children as low but a positive force in favour of having a \nchild might be needed. This might have been especially so in the time of societal \nupheaval in East Germany at the end of the 20th century.  \n \n \n7.
