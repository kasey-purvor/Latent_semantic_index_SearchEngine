The evaluation employed mixed methods to assess: learners\u2019 \nreactions to user-trainers and users as course members; changes in knowledge, \nattitudes and skills; and changes in individual and organisational practice.  Data \nwere collected from participant observation of training, 13 individual and 18 group \ninterviews with students and their managers (n = 13), and student ratings of \nknowledge and skills at the beginning and end of the programme (n = 49). The \nquality of care provided by students was rated by service users (n= 120) with \nwhom they worked, using a user-defined questionnaire.  The quality of care, and \nmental health and quality of life outcomes were compared to those for two \ncomparator groups (n = 44) in areas where no training had taken place.  \nIn general, the students reported positive learning outcomes associated with the \npartnership orientation of the programme and learning directly from and with \nservice users.  A higher proportion of programme users reported good user-\ncentred assessment and care planning and showed greater improvement in life \nskills compared to the comparators. \n This case study provides evidence of the value of partnership working with \nservice users in interprofessional post qualifying education in mental health.  The \n   2\nsuccess is attributed to the design of the programme and the responsiveness of \nthe programme board, which included service users.

The case study itself \nprovides a possible model for the systematic evaluation of partnerships with users \nin education and training. \n294 words \n \n   3\nIntroduction  \nIt has long been the ambition In England of policy makers, service providers and \nmental health professionals, as well as service users themselves, to establish \neffective joint working with people who use services (Department of Health, 1998).   \nAlthough much progress has been made since the days of consulting mental \nhealth service users about decisions that had already been made, this work is still \nchallenging.  Many suggestions of how it can be done have been put forward (e.g. \nCrepaz-Keay, et al. 1997; NIMHE, 2003) but these tend to concentrate on the \nprocesses of involving service users and provide only anecdotal accounts of \nbenefits to those involved; research on the outcomes of partnership education \nwith service users is uncommon.   \nTaylor and La Riche\u2019s (2006, this issue) review of partnerships with users in social \nwork education identified some evidence from the USA (Scheyett and Diehl 2004) \nthat \u2018structured dialogue\u2019 with mental health users improved students\u2019 attitudes but \nthat study did not investigate whether these improved attitudes were followed by \nchanges in practice.   \nAlso in the US, Cook et al. (1995) reported the evaluation of a two-day \nprogramme to deliver the basic concepts and techniques involved in delivering \ncommunity development services to mental health professionals in the USA. They \nused a before and after design to assess the trainees\u2019 attitudes towards people \nwith mental illness in the roles of service recipient, service deliverer and trainer.  \nTrainees received the same training on the first day, delivered by someone who \nwas not a user of mental health services. On the second day the 57 trainees were \nrandomly assigned to receive training from either a service user or a trainer who \ndid not have direct experience of using mental health services.  Trainees \n   4\ncompleted an attitude measure before the first day of training and again at the end \nof the programme. The authors reported that compared to those who had been \ntrained by a non-user, those who were trained by the user trainer expressed more \npositive attitudes towards people with mental illness overall, as service providers \nand trainers, following the training.  Of course, the positive change in attitudes \nreported could be due to the trainees having a different trainer on the second day \nof the programme.  Alternatively, it could be due to some other personal \ncharacteristic of the trainer, as opposed to their status simply as a user of mental \nhealth services. Consequently, the generalisations that can be drawn from the \nstudy are limited and once again, there is no evidence of any impact on practice. \nPartnerships in interprofessional education \nIt is particularly interesting to examine partnerships with mental health service \nusers in an interprofessional context.  Interprofessional working challenges the \npower structures between professions, aiming to break down professional \nhierarchies. In the same way, service user participation challenges the traditional \npower structure between professional and patient\/client.  The greatest differential \nis often perceived to be between doctor and patient (e.g. Crawford et al. 2003) but \nin mental health care, where a range of professionals can have the power to \nadminister compulsory care and treatment, there can be very complex issues to \novercome if partnership working with service users is to be achieved.   This is \nfurther complicated by the judgement of patients being called into question on \naccount of their illness (Rose et al, 2003).  \n  \nIn interprofessional education, especially in the context of university education, \nsimilar issues of power have to be overcome to achieve both partnership working \n   5\nbetween the separate departments which provide professional training and the \ninclusion of service users.  Equally important is the contribution service users \nbring to education, not only their perspective but also a knowledge base which is \nof immediate relevance to practice (Levin, 2004; Tew et al. 2004).  However, \nservice user input can bring a further challenge; professionals tend to be most \ncomfortable with the concept of propositional knowledge, defined as discipline-\nbased concepts, generalisation and practice principles that can be applied in \nprofessional action (Taylor, 1997, Chapter 11).  Service users trainers, on the \nother hand, are generally brought in to provide experiential knowledge by giving \n\u2018testimony\u2019, telling their personal stories and experience.  Training based on \npersonal history and insight is relatively new and can be stressful for the trainer \nand the learner (e.g. Daykin et al, 2002; Turner et al, 2000).  Therefore, both have \nto be supported and guidance on how this can be done is emerging (e.g. Levin, \n2004; Tew et al. 2004).  However, we could find no structured evaluations of the \noutcomes of this practice.  \n \nThe Birmingham University Programme in Community Mental Health  \nThis paper updates a case study of partnerships with service users in a \npostqualifying interprofessional training programme in community mental health.  \nAs previously described (Barnes et al., 2000), the perspectives of mental health \nservice users were represented in the commissioning, management, delivery, \nparticipation and evaluation of the programme.    In this paper we report a \nstructured evaluation of the outcomes.  Taking each role undertaken by service \nusers in the programme in turn we describe the contribution made by users and \nthe interim outcomes for the service users, the students and the programme.  We \nthen look longer term at the influence this partnership had on the students\u2019 \n   6\nlearning and the changes observed in their attitudes to working in partnership with \nusers, their skills and their practice. Finally, we report the outcomes for users with \nwhom the students worked.   \nThe programme of interprofessional education was a two-year part-time, post-\nqualifying course for mental health professionals that required one day a week \nattendance at the university during term-time and further study and practice in the \nworkplace.  The two-year programme led to a postgraduate diploma.  It focused \non working with people with severe mental illness living in the community.  Its \nstated aims were: 1) to train staff in the use of evidence-based psychosocial \ninterventions (cognitive behaviour therapy and family therapy); 2) to improve \nunderstanding of, and skills in, interprofessional working; and 3) to increase \nawareness of the importance of working from a service user\u2019s perspective.  \nCentral to the programme was a strong value base which emphasised partnership \nworking between service users and professionals in the development of user-\ncentred care.  The programme was interprofessional in management, staffing and \nstudent intake.  The core professions involved were mental health nursing, social \nwork and occupational therapy, with a small number of psychologists and \npsychiatrists.  A profile of the participants is given in Carpenter et al. (2006). \n \nMethods \nThe programme was evaluated over five years by the authors, an external \nresearch team from another university.  The evaluation was formative as well as \nsummative: emerging findings were fed back to the programme director and the \nprogramme management board and contributed to course development.   The \nevaluation was approved by a NHS Multi-Centre Research Ethics Committee. \nThe data reported in this paper derive from:  \n   7\n(1) Participation in meetings of the programme management board and \ninformal discussions with their members. \n(2) Participant observation of teaching; the observer (CD) made herself known \nto students and worked with them in small groups\/pairs as appropriate.  \nThe focus of the observations was on the reactions of the students to the \ncontent and delivery of the teaching, interprofessional interactions, \nstereotypes and the voicing of attitudes to service users. \n(3) three group interviews with three cohorts of students at the end of the first \nand second years of the programme.  The 18 groups were facilitated by \nmembers of the external evaluation team and discussion concentrated on \nthree primary goals of the programme as above. \n(4) A self-report questionnaire. We based this \u2018core competency\u2019 measure on \nthe capability framework for mental health practitioners (Sainsbury Centre \nfor Mental Health, 2001 p8) in order to assess changes in students\u2019 \nperceptions of their knowledge and skills.  Using a 10-point rating scale, \nthey were asked to rate the importance of each of the core competencies \nand to assess their own levels of skill and knowledge at the beginning (T1) \nand end of the taught programme (T2).  Three items concerned partnership \nworking with service users and are reported here. \n(5) individual workplace interviews with 23 students in 13 teams.   A semi-\nstructured interview was used which enquired into student\u2019s motivation for \nseeking access to the programme, their reactions to the training, the skills \nand knowledge they felt they gained and issues arising from trying to \nimplement learning.  \n   8\n(6) individual interviews with the 13 team managers or clinical supervisors of \nthe students, designed to corroborate the students\u2019 accounts of the \nimplementation of their learning. \n(7) users\u2019 opinions of user-defined quality of care outcomes.  For this we used \na 16-item, 5-point rating scale especially designed for this evaluation \n(Barnes et al., 2000a).  This assessed what users considered to be \nimportant outcomes of postqualifying education, such as: the user\u2019s \nprofessional relationship with the trainee; the extent to which the user felt \ninvolved in their own care and treatment; the quality of the information and \nadvice given; and whether they worked effectively with other agencies.   \nUsers were offered the choice of not participating, participating by returning \nthe questionnaire anonymously by post, a telephone interview, being \ninterviewed personally by a trained user-researcher or by a member of the \nevaluation team.  Equivalent data were collected from service users in two \ndistricts in another part of the country where no equivalent training had \ntaken place.   \n(8) Assessment, using standardised measures, of mental health, social \nfunctioning and quality of life outcomes over six months.  There were \ncompared to outcomes for users in the comparator districts.  Details of this \ncomponent of the evaluation, including the characteristics of students and \ncomparator staff and of both groups of service user participants are given \nin Carpenter et al., (2006). \n(9) Frequent discussions with the programme director and deputy director. In \naddition, the programme director was invited to respond in writing to issues \nraised in the evaluation report. \n \n   9\nData Analysis \nNotes of participant observations and quotes from group and individual interviews \nwere made at the time on either flip chart paper (for group interviews) or on the \nsemi-structured interview schedules.  These were entered into computer software \npackage NVIVO and analysed thematically (Searle, 2000).  The first level of \nanalysis was the roles in which service users were involved with the programme, \ni.e. in commissioning, programme management, teaching and learning.  Because \nthe study was concerned with the achievement of educational outcomes, the \nsecond level analytical framework employed the well-known Kirkpatrick (1967) \nmodel, as developed by Barr et al. (1999) for the assessment of outcomes in IPE.  \nRelevant components of this framework were: learners\u2019 reactions; knowledge and \nskills in partnership with users; modifications of attitudes to service users; transfer \nof learning to the workplace (behaviour); changes in organisational practice; and \noutcomes for service users. \n \nIn respect of these outcomes, observations and responses were categorised as \npositive\/negative and explanations were classified.  Quotations were selected to \nrepresent the various positions expressed by the respondents or evident in the \nobservations.  Where the programme responded to a particular set of findings with \na change to its content or structure, this is explained. \n \nQuantitative data were analysed using SPSS 12.  Changes in students\u2019 self-rating \nof knowledge and skills were assessed using the paired-sample t-test.  Quality of \ncare ratings were categorised as positive or negative and analysed using chi-\nsquare or, when cell counts were less than five, Fisher\u2019s exact test. Clinical, social \n   10\nand quality of life outcomes were evaluated using analysis of covariance, with \nbaseline scores as a covariate. \n \nFindings \nAnalysis of the interview data showed that there were not obvious differences \nbetween the views expressed by students from the different professions on the \nprogramme.  This is consistent with previously reported findings concerning their \nattitudes to the principles of community care (Barnes et al., 2000b).  \nConsequently, findings are presented from the students as a whole, or ascribed to \nindividuals.  There were some differences between students from the four \ndifferent cohorts studied and these are noted below. \n \nService users in commissioning \nThe commitment to partnership with service users was established in the original \nspecification for the programme and reinforced by service users participating in \nthe commissioning of both the programme and the external evaluation.  This \nprocess has been reported previously (Barnes et al. 2000a) but the impact \ncontinued to be felt throughout the five- year evaluation.  In particular, service \nusers took an active part in the Steering Group which advised the research.  A \nmajor influence exerted by them was ensuring that all discussions were in \naccessible language, the research methodology was adequately explained and \noutcome measures were carefully scrutinised for their suitability and the possible \nimpact on service users.   The service users on the Steering Group were amongst \nits longest serving members. \n \nService users in programme management and teaching \n   11\nService users participated in the Programme Management Board representing the \nviews of people with severe and enduring mental health problems.  They were \ninvolved in the selection and recruitment of new staff, contributed to curriculum \ndevelopment and helped with assessment. \n \nService users\u2019 most influential role was in teaching: at first they were brought in to \nteach on a sessional basis on two modules: the foundation module and the \u2018user \nparticipation and self help\u2019 module1.  However, once the programme had been \nrunning for two years and sufficient money was available, the university appointed \ntwo service users to the staff team as part-time lecturers.  These lecturers \nconvened the user participation module and contributed a user perspective on \nother modules, such as assessment and care planning. They also provided \nsupport to service users contributing to, and participating in the programme as \nstudents.  \n \nLearners\u2019 reactions \nReaction to service users as trainers was mixed.  Many students valued hearing \nfirsthand experiences of mental illness and of the use of services.  They respected \nservice users for being willing to tell their stories: \nThere is a shift in balance when users come in \u2013 it felt like they were really \nteaching us something. (Group interview 11) \nFor some students, service user trainers made an appreciable difference and \noffered an alternative to the teaching offered by professionals: \n                                            \n1 A description of this module and its assessment by service users is given by Bailey (2005). \n   12\nI felt it was good to have service users teaching on the course.  There was \none session on risk and I realised that I had never thought of it from a service \nuser perspective before.   (social worker 5) \nTheir teaching felt relevant to students who were able to see its wider application: \nThe people on the user module were good.  It was also new.  It had such an \nimpact because I knew I was going to use it.  (CPN 2) \nHowever, some students felt that they could not criticise service users\u2019 views in \nthe way they might challenge professionals, and they were afraid to ask questions \nfearing that they might say the \u2018wrong thing\u2019.  Students were also critical of the \nteaching skills of some service users:  \nI think it is very positive to have service users as presenters but in fairness \nsome need more support in presenting.  Just having the status of service \nuser does not qualify you to stand in front of a group of professionals.  \nHowever, the positive aspects need to be weighed up with the quality of what \nis said - there are only so many times that you can hear how poor services \nare.  (OT 7) \nParticipant observation indicated that service user trainers were not always given \nthe respect of other lecturers, and this was commented on by students. \nService users certainly did not get the same sort of respect as others \nteaching on the course, I don't know what it was but maybe it was because \nthey weren't qualified or maybe some of the presentations I saw were a bit \nwoolly and you weren't really sure where it was going.  Maybe in order to \npresent as tutors or trainers, whatever, service users need more input from \n   13\npeople with very good presentation skills, because, if you put me in front of a \nclass I wouldn't function well.  (CPN 8) \nConsequently, the programme ran workshops to train service users in \npresentation skills so that they could use their lived experience of mental health \nservices more effectively.  An annual development day was held to discuss \nstudents\u2019 feedback with service user presenters.   A group (Suresearch) was set \nup at the university run by and for service users to provide support for any users \nwho were contributing to the programme or involved in research locally.  The \nprogramme also introduced joint teaching sessions in which a service user trainer \nwas paired with an experienced staff member.  This ensured greater consistency \nin the delivery of the teaching and modelled partnership working.  It also \naddressed some of the anxieties students felt in challenging the views service \nuser trainers were putting forward.  The immediate outcome was improved ratings \nof teaching by service user trainers, while the longer-term impact of how this \nlearning was put into practice is discussed below. \nService users as students \nAlthough originally set up to train mental health professionals, the Programme \nManagement Board resolved that it would be consistent with the user-centred \nvalue base of the programme for service users themselves to be enrolled as \nstudents if they met the academic entry criteria.  These students were nominated \nand sponsored by the local health trusts and recruited on the basis of their \ninvolvement as \u2018user consultants\u2019 on trust committees or as user development \nworkers in community mental health teams.  It was argued that educating users to \na similar level as professional staff would enhance partnership in practice.  In \neach cohort one or two service users identified themselves and in one year six \n   14\nservice users were recruited.  Of course, some of the professionals on the \nprogramme are likely to have had direct experience of using services themselves.  \n \nThere were mixed reactions from other students to finding that the student group \nincluded identified service users.  Reactions ranged from welcome to shock: \nI do not have a problem with service users on the course.  I think it is helpful \nto have them there.  I see them as people.  It helps to remind us we are all \npeople in this mental health venture together.  (OT 16) \nInitially I was shocked that users were on the course.  It was not just that \nthere was the user; it was the way it was managed.  (CPN 2) \nAs with service user trainers, some students stated that they experienced difficulty \nin debating issues freely in front of identified service users.  They believed that \nthey should be able to overcome this reaction but were nevertheless felt inhibited:  \nI have some reservations about service users as students because it limits \nhow comfortable we are talking about some things.  It makes me more \nconscious about what I say.  I would also be unsure how to have a debate \nwith someone - if I upset them, then I will feel guilty. (CPN 18) \nIndividually service users can be critical and quite aggressive; therefore the \nrest of us all shut up.  You could argue that we should get past that but there \nis something about an argument with a service user that makes it unequal.  I \nwould not feel the same about an argument with other members of a \nmultidisciplinary team.  There are lots of things not said.  (OT 7)     \nStudents found it especially difficult when there was only one service user in a \ncohort. \n   15\nI found this really problematic.  I would find it easier to disagree if there was \nmore than one person.  I would have felt like I was singling him out if I had \ndisagreed with him.  (OT 7) \nThere was not only an issue of attitude; there were also practical difficulties.   For \nexample, problems arose when service users became unwell.  Students felt the \nprogramme staff had been unprepared for this situation and were slow to handle \nit: \nThere has been one service user who is a student on the course who has not \nbeen well. She was just anti everything and it can get your back up when you \nhear everything being negative. I think she slowed us down a lot.  (CPN 17) \nAnother source of tension was that students were expected to applying their \nlearning of skills in clinical practice. Service users were unable to participate fully \nin the programme in this way and different assignments had to be developed. The \nprogramme staff responded by making clear its rationale for training service \nusers: \nThe programme has never aspired to train users to become quasi \nprofessionals. Instead it has sought to give users an opportunity to question \nthe appropriateness of contemporary approaches and incorporate this \nwidened understanding in their role with other users and colleagues.  \n(Programme Director) \nThe programme also increased the size of the service user group on modules \nwhere partnership with users was a focus.  This was done by inviting professional \nstudents to bring a service user with whom they worked to the module and \nrecruiting other service users to attend the module as paid participants.  The \n   16\npresence of a larger proportion of service users in the module enabled more open \ndiscussion. \nOver the 5 years of the evaluation, considerable change was observed on the \nprogramme and in its impact in the region.  The commitment to service user \npartnership remained strong and service user-taught modules became less \ncontroversial as the teaching became more effective.  However, service users on \nthe staff team who moved on to advance their careers were not replaced, \napparently because of reduced funding.  Also, none of the service user students \nwho were tracked through the programme qualified successfully at the end of the \ntwo years, in most cases because they failed to submit the course assignments \nand\/or dropped out because of mental ill health.   \n \nChanges in knowledge and skills \nThe core competences rating scale was completed on two occasions by 49 \nstudents drawn from two intakes of the course (response rate 76% of those who \ncompleted the two years). At the beginning of the programme, almost all students \nrated knowledge of service user involvement and empowerment as \u201cextremely \nimportant\u201d (Table 1).  At the beginning of the Programme, students rated their \nknowledge and skills in \u2018facilitating therapeutic co-operation\u2019 and in using a \u2018user \nand carer oriented perspective based on partnership in the provision of \nassessment, treatment and continuing care\u2019 as modest (mean ratings around 6 on \nthe 10-point scale), although the standard deviations were quite large, indicating a \nwide range of ratings from the students.  But they reported the knowledge gained \nabout working from a user and family perspective led them to review their own \npractice.   \n \n   17\nTable 1 about here \n \nAt the end of the end of the Programme, ratings were substantially higher (means \nscore over 8), with a much smaller range of response (fig. 1). \n \nStudents explored empowerment, considering when and how service users \nshould be involved in the planning, management and review of services and how \nthey should participate in planning their own care.  It was accepted that \nempowerment was challenging: \nThe need for balance between user empowerment and boundary setting; the \ncase-study \u2026 was thought provoking! (CPN 12) \nIt was also suggested that service users in general had changed in their \ndemands: \nUsers seemed to have changed stance, in terms of fighting the system; now \nthey are collaborating to change it. (SW 5) \nMore practical knowledge reported included learning where and how to access \ninformation, developing directories of local service user groups\/resources and \nunderstanding the value of advocacy. \n \nChanges in attitudes \nIn the workplace interviews, students reported changes in attitudes towards \npartnership with service users, e.g.:     \nI\u2019d say the biggest thing the course has given me is the user perspective.  I \nturned up thinking, \u2018Yeh, yeh. It is not the real world\u2019.  Now I think it can be \npart of the real world. (Group Interview 12) \n   18\nThis was the area of teaching from which students felt that they had benefited \nmost:  \n[the programme]  has not really changed the way I work with other \nprofessionals but it definitely has with service users.  Before I was only the \nnurse and they were the service user.  Now they are no longer just the \nillness.  It was the best thing I got from the course.  Previously I was anti- the \nuser movement.  I thought it was just another movement.  But when [user \npresenter] was talking I was thinking, 'Oh, I've done that'.  (CPN 26) \n \nChanges in behaviour: individual practice \nThe interviews with students revealed a number of ways in which they had \nchanged their practice as a result of their learning.  Awareness of the imbalance \nof power between service users and professionals had made students more \nconscious of sharing decision-making and a need-led approach: \nPerson centred planning has had an impact.  Seeing things from a user\u2019s \npoint of view can be liberating rather than restricting.  For example, what one \nservice user really wanted was to see her grandchild - and she did not have \nto have a day centre place to do this.  (Group interview 15)  \nMany students considered that changes in their practice had been subtle rather \nthan fundamental but these changes could have a beneficial effect for service \nusers, for example, giving them more time and being more open to considering \nrisk: \nMy practice has not changed radically due to the Programme in the way I \nwork with users - although I probably make more time for them.  I keep my \n   19\ncaseload low and respond quicker.  I go when they need me, they don\u2019t ask \nfor help often.  (CPN 1) \n I do not think that the course has changed the way I work with service users \nbut I am more adventurous and take risks.  I am not afraid of upsetting \nclients.  I back it up with knowledge and information.  (CPN 18) \nStudents experimented with obtaining feedback about the services they received; \nthis met with varied success.  Managers reported that many team colleagues \nwere not confident about this work and welcomed the new skills that students \nbrought back to their teams from the programme. \n \nChange in behaviour: organisational practice \nChanges in partnership practice with service users introduced by the students to \nthe workplace included the setting up and running service user groups, ensuring \nuser views were fed into service planning decisions, supporting service users on \nstaff recruitment panels, writing leaflets for users and carers about the services \noffered and collating information about resources for users  \n \nThe barriers to implementing this learning were more often about resources than \nattitudes, but concerns were expressed about tokenism and representation.  \nThere was also some evidence of the changing climate of partnerships with \nservice users over the five years of the study.  At the start of the evaluation, \nstudents were reporting setting up user groups or supporting fledgling groups.  By \ncohort 4, user groups had been set up in most trusts and users were exerting a \nmuch wider influence; the students\u2019 roles became more supportive. \n \n   20\nOutcomes for users as service recipients \nOverall, responses to the user-defined questionnaire were positive (Table 2). \nAlmost all users believed that the students treated them with respect and \nunderstood them and their experience of mental ill health.  With regard to multi-\ndisciplinary working, around three-quarters of users considered that the student \nhad worked with other agencies to ensure  their needs were met. Likewise, very \nsimilar proportions reported that their named worker checked that they had been \nable to get the help the user considered that they needed from services.  \nHowever, users in the comparator groups reported similarly positive opinions.  \nTable 2 about here \nOver three quarters of users in the study groups stated that the students had had \ninvolved them in care planning as much as they wished; this compares favourably \nwith users in the comparator groups. Similarly, significantly greater proportions of \nusers reported that the students had asked whether they wanted a carer or \nmember of their family involved in planning their care. This could not be \naccounted for by a greater proportion of users in one group living at home \nbecause proportions were similar.  It may therefore be attributed to the \nprogramme's teaching emphasis on involving family carers in care planning and \non family therapy. \nThe service users with whom the students worked (n=72) improved significantly \nover six months in terms of their social functioning (F1,62 = 4.12, p = 0.047) and life \nsatisfaction (F1,59 = 6.43, p = 0.014), but not in their mental health status.  Users in \nthe comparator groups also improved in life satisfaction and social functioning, but \nthe improvement in social functioning was significantly greater for those users in \nthe programme group than for the comparators (F3,155 = 7.31 p <0.001).  These \nresults are reported in detail in Carpenter et al. (2006).    \n   21\n \nDiscussion \nIn this case study, partnership working that was both modelled by, and taught on, \nthe programme was challenging for programme staff, the students and the service \nusers involved.  Much of the experience was positive but difficulties were \nencountered.  It would not be appropriate to generalise these conclusions, but the \nlessons learned are likely to be relevant for programmes elsewhere.    \n \nThus, it was important that the commitment to partnership working, including \nworking in partnership with service users was evident from the start.  This was \nbuilt into commissioning, programme management, delivery, and evaluation.  It \nwas made explicit in programme objectives and learning outcomes. \n \nPartnership working which pushes at the orthodox structures of power is \nacknowledged to be difficult.  In modelling partnership working with \ninterprofessional partners tensions were experienced when the imbalance of \npower between stakeholders was too great or when the conventional order was \nchallenged.  In these situations, the programme did not back off but sought \nsolutions which would help to equalise partnerships.  For example, when students \nexpressed concern that their learning was being affected by variable standards of \nteaching by service users, the programme responded by obtaining funds to train \nthe user-trainers to use their experiential knowledge more effectively.  When \nprofessionals expressed discomfort learning alongside service users, the \nprogramme challenged professionals\u2019 attitudes by increasing the number of \nservice users involved.  This reduced their minority status in the student group \nand prevented service users being seen as vulnerable to challenge. \n   22\n The constant reminder of the programme\u2019s partnership aims in the make-up of the \nmanagement board, the staff team, the student body and the programme content \nmeant partnership working was integrated into the student\u2019s experience \nthroughout their learning.  There was no escaping the issues and even when \nunfortunate incidents arose, such as a service user student becoming unwell, \naccommodation was found, as it has to in practice.  The experience of this \npartnership in action, together with enhanced skills and knowledge, seems to \nhave given students the confidence to implement this learning, affecting not only \ntheir personal practice but also influencing change in their agencies. \n \nOf course the programme did not operate in a vacuum; it must be put in context.  \nAs it was a post-qualifying programme, the professionals on it were already in \npractice and often had had many years of experience.  As an experienced \npractitioner it is not easy to acknowledge that you may not have been putting \nservice users first in the interventions provided.  It often took an anecdote or \npersonal story from a service user on their experience of receiving care for \nstudents to appreciate the changes in attitudes needed and it is to the credit of \nstudents that they were willing to subject their practice to this level of reflection.  \nAs it was a voluntary programme perhaps it attracted students who were \nparticularly open to change but overall, the teaching from service users contained \nsome of the strongest messages that students apparently took from the \nprogramme overall. \n \nHowever, students were not only subject to learning from the programme but also \nreceived daily influence from their workplace which could often act as a barrier to \n   23\nimplementing learning.  The responsibility on students to share their learning with \ntheir colleagues was generally regarded as a burden and rejected by teams, but \nengagement with service users tended to be welcomed.  Colleagues were often \nrelieved to see students take responsibility for promoting partnership working with \nusers such as collecting feedback, running groups and accessing information.  At \nthe same time, students were able to change their personal practice to provide \nmore person-centred care. \nConclusions  \nThe evaluation of this programme provides some evidence of the value \npartnership working with service users in interprofessional post qualifying training.  \nThe students, the majority of whom were experienced professionals, \nacknowledged the influence of working with and hearing directly from service \nusers.  It not only helped to develop ability for working in partnership with users,  \nbut with altered attitudes, new skills and a favourable policy context, students \nfound that they could introduce this learning into their personal practice and affect \na degree of organisational change.   \n \nWe cannot say whether the same ends could have been achieved without direct \nuser partnership in the programme.  To examine this question would require \ncomparison of outcomes with a programme which taught about partnerships with \nusers rather than involved them directly (c.f. Cook et al., 1995).   \n \nThe level of success achieved by service user involvement in this training \nprogramme must in part be attributed to original design of the programme and the \nresponsiveness of the programme staff and board.  If service users are to be \nempowered in contributing to professional training, they cannot be expected to \n   24\nsimply react to the status quo.  Their role is to influence change and those \nchanges are likely to be in the programme as well as through the learning \nexperiences of students.  The programme may provide a useful model for \nprogrammes elsewhere and for other user groups.  Further, this case study \nprovides a possible model for the systematic evaluation of partnerships with users \nin education and training. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThe evaluation was carried by when the authors were all working at the Centre for \nApplied Social and Community Studies, Durham University.
