In this paper, the authors describe and compare computer technologies used for instruction in\nComputer-Aided Instruction (CAI) courses, electronic books, and knowledge-transfer systems based\non heterogeneous information. They also deal with some psychological issues involved in dialogue, with\nthe adaptability of knowledge-transfer systems, and with psychologically-based computerized\ninstruction.\nIntroduction\nThe use of computer technology in instruction is based on known approaches to\ninstruction, and also promotes new approaches. Contemporary problems in instruction\ntend to be determined by intensive information-flow and the short timescale of the\nrelevance of information.\nComputer-aided instruction courses\nHistorically, the primary method of teaching is the so-called 'Nurnberg funnel' method.\nThis is based on the assumption that knowledge in the teacher's head is linked to some\n'correct' structure, and the objective of the teaching is to place facts and relations between\nthem into the heads of a student with minimal distortion. Obviously, this is a simplified\napproach to teaching, which nevertheless, under certain conditions, provides reasonably\ngood results. However, its effectiveness depends heavily on the personality of the teacher,\nand it significantly underestimates the student's personality, thus decreasing the\npossibilities of creative learning.\nThe introduction of the personal computer caused an exponential growth in the number\nof knowledge-transfer systems based on this approach, and the possibility of widely\ndisseminating an outstanding teacher seemed to be one of its major advantages.\n42\nAa-J Volume 3 Number 2\nKnowledge-transfer systems of this kind are built as restricted models of a human\nteacher. Traditionally, the teacher determines objectives and the means of instruction,\nmakes decisions about the level of interaction, manages time, and evaluates the student's\nactivity and performance. So, in human-computer dialogue which simulates the dialogue\nbetween a teacher and a student, the student is mainly a passive partner and the computer\nis an active, leading partner. This model often assumes that the learner knows almost\nnothing about the domain in question, nor about the ways to study it. Under these\nconditions, the computer imposes the sequence in which the domain is to be studied, and\nthus determines the skeleton of the knowledge-transfer system. Knowledge-transfer\nsystems of this kind are often called Computer-Aided Instruction (CAI) courses.\nTwo major obstacles are encountered in implementing and using CAI courses. Many\npeople use computers as tools in their everyday work, where the computer is considered a\npassive partner in the human-computer interaction. For such people, a contradiction\nappears when it comes to computer-aided learning: the computer which is thought of as a\ntool and a slave becomes an instructor and a master. Under such conditions, people may\nfeel uncomfortable because their role in the dialogue, now controlled by a computer, has\nchanged (Kommisarova, 1994). Such discomfort may adversely affect students'\nmotivation, as well their emotional state, and may decrease the effectiveness of computer-\naided learning. The second obstacle is that since learning depends so heavily on the\npersonality of the teacher, it makes sense for one author (or a small group of authors) to\ndesign a CAI course. This in itself is a constraint.\nElectronic books\nAccording to current educational theory, direct transfer of knowledge from teacher to\nstudent is impossible. Learning is a process involving the juxtaposition of, on the one\nhand, new facts and theories, and on the other, facts and theories already formed in the\nstudent's mind, a process which may result in augmenting or restructuring the latter.\nInstruction within higher education relies heavily on such a process, and thus independent\nstudy, in which students can adapt the procedures associated with knowledge acquisition\nto their own cognitive processes, is encouraged. This approach is also effectively\nsupported by modern technology in the form of electronic books which can be used to\ndeliver information not only as text but also as images, sound and animation (see Barker,\n1991), with hypermedia links.\nKnowledge-transfer systems of the above-mentioned type use a different model of\nhuman-computer interaction. Here, the computer is considered to be a tool which\nimmediately appears comfortable to use although the activity may be new. But there is a\nclear difference between using the computer as a tool in an everyday activity and as a tool\nfor learning. The field to be studied and its internal structure may be terra incognita for\nthe user. Tables of contents and indexes do little to help a student who does not know the\nrelevant terminology, nor how to begin. The student needs guidelines for an efficient\nacquisition of knowledge, and additional information about the logical structure of the\nknowledge-transfer system, as well as about the logical structure of the field in general\nand the potential links between information 'frames' within the knowledge-transfer\nsystem. The feeling of being an independent explorer of a knowledge-domain can increase\n43\nOleg P. Pilipenko and Helena Komissamva Approaches to knowledge-transfer systems\nthe motivation of a student, but he or she can easily be distracted and simply go off\ncourse (Barker, 1990). This can prevent effective knowledge transfer and evoke a negative\nemotional attitude to the computer, or at least to computer-assisted learning.\nWe believe that any knowledge-transfer system should incorporate both the knowledge\nand the techniques needed to use it. The teacher's knowledge about the sequence in which\na student should ideally approach the information is of particular importance, and the\nstudent also needs to know why certain parts of it are more important than others. Thus\ncategorization of the links between information frames should be an essential feature of\nthe above-mentioned kinds of knowledge-transfer systems. For example, we may specify\nlinks which describe a recommended way to learn the proposed material, or several\ndifferent ways recommended by different teachers, or determined by different learning\nobjectives. Links to information frames relevant to the study of the current frame, and\nlinks between frames exploiting the same methodological approach, might also be\nassigned to particular categories of links.\nAdding power to a knowledge-transfer system\nby means of dialogue\nDialogue can be used as a method of access to data contained in knowledge-transfer\nsystem. The dialogue scenario should generate information about why and how one\nshould use the system. Some authors of electronic books offer a sequence of questions\nand answers. In such cases, the roles of the participants are strictly determined: one is the\nactive partner, the other is the passive partner, though this situation can be reversed - the\nanswering (passive) partner can momentarily take the initiative if he or she does not have\nenough information to answer the question. The answering partner may also take the\ninitiative when the asking (active) partner fails to put the question in a way that is clearly\nunderstandable by the answering partner, and the latter may need to ask a series of\nquestions in order to determine the precise demands of the asking partner. The changing\nof roles in partner dialogues of the kind under consideration here are discussed in more\ndetail in Pilipenko (1994).\nWe believe that a reasonable balance between activeness and passiveness in such\ndialogues is vital for effective learning to take place when using knowledge-transfer\nsystems. At each step of the human-computer dialogue, the system should provide the\nuser with all necessary information, including information about its own built-in\nfunctionality. Students feel comfortable if they feel they are in control, and if they can\npredict the overall behaviour of the knowledge-transfer system.\nKnowledge-transfer systems delivering heterogeneous information\nElectronic books lend themselves well to situations where information from different\nsources needs to be presented in a homogeneous form, though it is then important to\nexplain the connections and differences between the viewpoints, and perhaps the\nterminology, adopted by different authors. However, a particularly interesting trend,\nbased on the idea of the usage of heterogeneous information in knowledge-transfer\nsystems, is that of so-called open hypermedia systems. A significant development related\n44\nVolume 3 Number 2\nto this approach is the Microcosm system developed at Southampton University (Davis et\nal, 1992). The Microcosm environment allows information frames created with different\napplications to be incorporated into one system. Markup information, which is used to\ndesignate links between information frames, is physically separated from corresponding\nframes. Thus the documents included in the knowledge-transfer system are always\navailable for modification within the applications which were used to create them.\nComputer-based knowledge-transfer systems can thus be modified dynamically, and\neasily extended not only with new information frames, but also with new links.\nKnowledge-transfer systems based on this approach can support several methods of\nstructuring information simultaneously, and along with heterogeneous information\nframes, can contain a heterogeneous system of links, for example recommendations as to\nhow and why to access information frames composed by different teachers or intended\nfor students with different backgrounds or different objectives. Learning supported with\nknowledge-transfer systems based on open hypermedia can also be underpinned by\ndynamic modifications made by a teacher while using the system, as he or she finds new\nlinks which can then be added: learning by doing is thus especially suited to such systems.\nNew links, and possibly new information frames, can be created as a direct result of the\nsearch for information relevant to the problem in hand.\nShared computer books\nAnother way to use the unique potential of dynamically modifiable knowledge transfer-\nsystems lies in the idea of shared electronic books, that is, made available to several users\nsimultaneously. Shared electronic books can be open not only for joint access, but also\nfor modification by all users. Users can add new facts, new ways of handling facts already\ncontained in the systems, and comments. A shared electronic book can become the joint\ncreative output of many people.\nThe potential of the World Wide Web is also interesting in terms of the development of\nshared electronic books. The most interesting feature of the World Wide Web is that there\nis no centralized maintenance or support. It is the result of the creativity of many people.\nOn the other hand, the very absence of centralized support means that the Web cannot\nperform the role of active partner in a human-computer dialogue: the information\ncontained in the Web is poorly structured (and searching for information can at present\ntake an unacceptably long time). Nevertheless, we believe that information has the\nstrange ability to be self-structuring, a property which can manifest itself both in the\nintentional actions of a co-ordinated group of people, and in the chaotic activity of\ndifferent people who do not even know of the existence of each other. We therefore expect\nthat the increasing amount of information available on the Web will not lead to its\ncollapse, as many would argue, but rather to an improvement of its structure.\nAdaptability of knowledge-transfer systems\nKnowledge-transfer systems should ideally be able to adapt to student needs, including\ntaking into, account different personal styles of knowledge acquisition. Knowledge-\ntransfer systems should also keep track of the dialogue between user and computer, and\nmemorize which information frames have been accessed by the student, as well as\n45\nO\/eg P. Pilipenko and Helena Komissarova Approaches to knowledge-transfer systems\nevaluating the student's progress and level of comprehension of the material placed in the\nsystem. Monitoring dialogue traces is particularly important, since the student who is just\nstarting to tackle a new subject can then have access to the ways in which it has been\ntackled by other students. In addition, the teacher (or group of teachers) responsible for\nthe maintenance of the knowledge-transfer system can make appropriate corrections to\nthe dialogue scenario if most the students are not using it efficiently (at critical points\nstudents may have to be guided more actively).\nConclusion\nThe ultimate degree of adaptability in instruction is complete individualization. To\nachieve this, a computer-based knowledge-transfer system would have to take into\naccount not only the intellectual background and progress of a student, nor only errors\nand general and specific performance, but it would also have to adopt a style of\ninstruction precisely fitting the learning style of the student, including his or her cognitive\nand personality\/psychological features such as holism\/serialism, impulsivity\/reflexivity,\nflexibility\/rigidness, verbal\/image thinking, introversion\/extroversion, field-dependence,\nlevel of anxiety, and so forth. Such a task would require a thorough probing of a student's\npersonal characteristics with a series of psychological tests, and careful monitoring of his\nor her learning activity and performance.\nWe do not foresee such knowledge-transfer systems in the near future. At present, only\nthe first of the four accepted divisions of computer-based instructional systems (domain\nor field knowledge-base, pedagogical module, student module, and interface) have been\ndeveloped to a satisfactory degree. Theoretical and technical progress in interface\nconstruction is significantly poorer. The same applies to the pedagogical division, and the\nproblems of student-module design are not even yet solved in principle. Nevertheless,\nwhile waiting for progress in these areas, we should pay as much attention as possible\nwhen designing knowledge-transfer systems to individualization, and to the issues related\nto the dialogue between human being and computer.\nEditorial note\nThis paper was given at a NATO ASI (Advanced Studies Institute) held in Heriot-Watt\nUniversity in the summer of 1994.\nAcknowledgements\nWe should like to thank Professor Ray McAleese and the British Council for their\nassistance and support.\nReferences\nKommisarova, H.
