FULLER AND HARIPRIYA NARASIMHAN\nLondon School of Economics and Political Science\nIn south India\u2019s rapidly expanding information technology (IT) industry, the\nsmall, traditional elite of Tamil Brahmans is disproportionately well rep-\nresented. Actually, no figures to confirm this assertion exist, but all the circum-\nstantial evidence suggests that it is true, especially among the IT professionals\nand software engineers employed by the leading software and services compa-\nnies in Chennai (Madras).1 Since the nineteenth century, Tamil Brahmans have\nsuccessfully entered several new fields of modern professional employment,\nparticularly administration, law, and teaching, but also engineering, banking,\nand accountancy. Hence the movement into IT, despite some novel features,\nhas clear precedents. All these professional fields require academic qualifica-\ntions, mostly at a higher level, and the Brahmans\u2019 success is seemingly\nexplained by their standards of modern education, which reflect their caste tra-\nditions of learning.2\nAcknowledgments: Research was carried out in Chennai for about twelve months in total between\nAugust 2003 and February 2005, and among Vattima Brahmans in Tippirajapuram between\nSeptember 2005 and March 2006, in the United States in September 2006, and in Chennai and\nother Indian cities between January and April 2007.

In the \u201cChairman\u2019s Recommendation,\u201d published as a separate\nvolume, the table of educational indices (Table D, pp. 76\u201386) shows that Brahmans have higher\nindices than all other castes for higher secondary education and above, and for higher secondary\neducation only, and very low indices for educational drop-outs and illiterates.\nComparative Studies in Society and History 2008;50(1):170\u2013196.\n0010-4175\/08 $15.00 # 2008 Society for Comparative Study of Society and History\nDOI: 10.1017\/S0010417508000091\n170\nYet education alone is not a sufficient explanation. Also important is\nmigration, as well as the Tamil Brahmans\u2019 emergence as an urban and\nindeed urbanized community. Although more Brahmans may still live in vil-\nlages than is usually assumed, a massive rural-to-urban migration has occurred\nsince the nineteenth century. Moreover, numerous Brahmans moved from\nTamilnadu to other parts of India during the twentieth century, as well as to\nforeign countries in recent decades. Migration and urbanization among contem-\nporary Tamil Brahmans, including IT professionals, therefore have a historical\ndepth and geographical spread that this article seeks to explore.\nB R A HMAN L A ND L O R D S : T H E H I S T O R I C A L B A C K G R O UND\nBrahmans have always been a partially urban caste, resident in south India\u2019s old\ntowns and cities. The majority, however, lived in the countryside. Tamilnadu is\ngeographically divided into two main areas: the wet, paddy-cultivating zone of\nthe river valleys and the dry zone of the plains. Brahmans were concentrated in\nthe wet zone\u2014especially the central valley of the River Kaveri and its delta\u2014\nwhereas in dry-zone villages there were normally none, apart from some poor\npriestly families. There are Telugu, Kannada, and Maharashtrian Deshastha\nBrahman minorities in Tamilnadu, but the majority are Tamil Brahmans;\napart from Adishaivas and other small priestly subcastes, most Tamil Brahmans\nbelong to the larger Smarta or Aiyar group, or the smaller Sri Vaishnava or\nAiyangar one. In the early twentieth century, Brahmans made up approximately\n2.5 percent of the Tamil country\u2019s population (Radhakrishnan 1989: 507). This\nis equivalent to about 1.5 million out of Tamilnadu\u2019s population of 62 million\nas recorded in the 2001 census, but the true figure must be lower, mainly\nbecause of emigration from the state, although this cannot be confirmed\nbecause neither the government of India nor any other organization collects\nstatistics about \u201cForward Castes\u201d (including Brahmans), who cannot benefit\nfrom the reservations system operated for the \u201cBackward\u201d and \u201cScheduled\nCastes\u201d in education and employment.\nThe Tamil Brahmans\u2019 rural history goes back to at least the Pallava period\n(c. 575\u2013900), when they were settled on lands donated by kings and chiefs.\nAs Ludden (following Stein 1980) explains, during the medieval period in\nthe river valleys under the \u201calliance\u201d between Brahmans and Vellalas\u2014a high-\nranking, non-Brahman \u201cpeasant\u201d caste\u2014irrigated agriculture developed as\n\u201chigh-caste landowners brought under their control land, labor, and water;\nestablished their status in the agrarian system as a whole; and developed tech-\nnical skills to expand the irrigation economy, all at the same time.\u201d In the pre-\ncolonial economy, owning land \u201cmeant to be a member of a family in a group of\nshareholders; and to own not soil itself but all the varied resources involved in\none\u2019s family share\u201d (Ludden 1985: 85). These shares were normally unequal in\nsize and value (ibid.: 89). The British, following Muslim usage, called a land-\nowning shareholder a mirasidar and, by the British and eventually by\nF R O M L A N D L O R D S T O S O F T WA R E E N G I N E E R S 171\nthemselves, mirasidars came to be regarded as \u201chereditary landlords.\u201d When\nthe colonial government imposed the ryotwari system of land settlement on\nthe Madras Presidency during the nineteenth century, the mirasidars acquired,\nas individuals or families, proprietary rights to very variable amounts of land,\nas well as obligations to pay tax, unless (like many Brahmans) their lands were\nconfirmed as tax-free (inam). Notwithstanding the imperial ideology of land\nsettlement and emergent capitalist ownership, the reality was \u201can accommo-\ndation with the political elites of the countryside\u201d (Baker 1984: 71), so that\nrural society stayed much the same, even though more extensive change\nwould occur eventually. As a group, moreover, Brahman and Vellala mirasi-\ndars\u2014supported by the British, as by previous rulers\u2014were in practice \u201cthe\ngovernment in the wet zone\u201d and, with other high-caste peers, \u201ccomprised\nthe subregional ruling class\u201d (Ludden 1985: 90; cf. D. Kumar 1983: 210\u201311).\nA crucial feature, as Ludden explains, is that \u201cMirasidar wealth, education,\nand cultural refinement depended on freedom from work in the fields\u201d (1985:\n90). All mirasidars had their land cultivated by non-Brahman tenants or by\nlandless laborers, normally belonging to the Pallar and Paraiyar untouchable\ncastes. Especially among Brahmans, who were in principle the bearers of San-\nskritic culture and religion, \u201cnot putting one\u2019s hands in the mud would have\nbecome a mark of entitlement to elite stature\u201d (ibid.: 91). Disdain for manual\nagricultural work is not peculiar to Tamil Brahmans, however, even if they jus-\ntified it on religious grounds, for Vellalas and other landlords throughout south\nAsia and beyond have shared the same outlook. Yet caste variations were or\nbecame significant by the late nineteenth century. Vellalas were portrayed as\nthe Tamil country\u2019s authentic agriculturalists (Irschick 1994: 196\u2013202), so\nthat proverbially \u201cfarming is in the blood\u201d for Vellalas, whereas other castes\nmake bad farmers (Ludden 1999: 144). Brahman mirasidars, in particular,\nare identified as landlords without any organic connection to the land.\nTo impose their land settlement, the British relied heavily on extant admin-\nistrative systems. In the countryside, two key figures were the village accoun-\ntant and headman. Many of these men, especially accountants, were Brahmans\nand likely to be literate, which gave them an advantage over others in English\neducation. These \u201crevenue Brahmans\u201d (Conlon 1977: 54) and other men in the\nvillage elite progressively joined the ranks of the colonial state\u2019s personnel,\nespecially in the river valleys (Baker 1984: 89; D. Kumar 1983: 209;\nLudden 1985: 102\u20137). (The Nawab of Arcot\u2019s eighteenth-century revenue\nadministration in Madras was dominated by Telugu Niyogi Brahmans\n[Wagoner 2003: 796].) Engagement with the state often meant a move to\ntown and, during the later nineteenth century, mirasidars in general and Brah-\nmans in particular moved in increasing numbers to urban areas for education\nand employment. In the 1890s, it was reported that many a formerly \u201ccon-\ntented\u201d mirasidar, \u201cwishes to give his boys an expensive English education\nand to marry his daughters to educated husbands,\u201d which often proved\n172 C . J . F U L L E R A N D H A R I P R I YA N A R A S I M H A N\nfinancially difficult. In numerous families, too, men were leaving to find jobs\nelsewhere (Raghavaiyangar 1893: 337). A lot of these mobile Brahmans\nbelonged to major landowning families, but men with no or only a little land\nalso joined the migration, as did many priests, who were mostly poor. Educated\nBrahmans soon began to dominate administration and law in particular. In this\nprocess, crucial in the emergence of a new Brahman identity marked by \u201ctwin\nroles\u201d as both \u201cauthentic\u201d and \u201cmodern\u201d (Pandian 2007: 37, passim), Brah-\nmans were further assisted by their privileged position in the colonialists\u2019\nnotion of Brahmanical \u201ctradition\u201d as the keystone of south Indian society\n(Dirks 2001: 166\u201372, passim).\nB R A HMAN V I L L A G E S : T H E E T H N OG R A P H I C B A C K G R O UND\nThe Tamil Brahmans\u2019 history can be further explored through twentieth-\ncentury village ethnographies. In \u201cBrahman villages,\u201d where Brahman mirasi-\ndars owned the majority of the land and formed the dominant caste, Brahmans\n(both landlords and others, such as priests) lived in the agraharam. The agra-\nharam, consisting of one or more streets, was exclusively occupied by Brah-\nmans and spatially demarcated from the main village area, often called the\nur, where the non-Brahmans lived. The untouchables lived in a colony\n(cheri) separated from this area. In most Brahman villages today, the agra-\nharam also houses non-Brahmans, but rural Dalits, the ex-untouchables, still\ntend to live only in their colonies and we have never heard of any Dalits\nliving in an agraharam.\nLimitations of space mean that we can refer to the Brahman village ethnogra-\nphy only summarily.3 The first systematic surveys of Tamil villages, done in\n1916\u20131917, included two Brahman villages: Dusi, near Kanchipuram, in the\nnorthern Palar valley, and Gangaikondan, near Tirunelveli, in the southern\nTambraparni valley. Dusi and Gangaikondan have been restudied several\ntimes, especially in 1936\u20131937 and 1983\u20131984.\nIn 1911, there were 251 households in Dusi, whose agraharam contained\nsixty-six Brahman households, almost all Sri Vaishnava. Virtually all non-\nBrahmans worked the Brahmans\u2019 land as tenants. The Brahmans were nearly\n3 In this list of all significant Brahman village ethnographic studies, the village name is followed\nby fieldwork dates, ethnographer\u2019s name, and bibliographical details.

Three graduates from Dusi were employed else-\nwhere, and twenty-four boys had gone on to higher education (Slater 1918:\n84\u201386, 91\u201393). From 1932, emigration from Dusi increased in response to\nlocal water shortages and the impact of the depression. Brahmans in particular\nleft, so that by 1937 only forty-two Brahman households remained and the\nagraharam presented \u201ca very deserted appearance\u201d as vacant houses were dere-\nlict. The number of absentee landlords had greatly increased as well (Thomas\nand Ramakrishnan 1940: 182\u201383, 188; cf. Dupuis 1960: 350\u201352). In the fol-\nlowing years, Brahmans continued to leave. There were thirty-three Brahman\nhouseholds in 1959 and only sixteen in 1983, when half the now small agra-\nharam\u2019s residents were non-Brahmans, although Brahmans, many of them\nabsentee landlords, still owned a lot of land. Their power and authority,\nhowever, faded markedly in the 1960s, so that the \u201conce autocratic and high-\nhanded\u201d Brahmans had to come to terms with the newly dominant Nayakkars\n(Guhan and Bharathan 1984: 6, 16, 47, 161\u201362, 168).\nIn 1911, Gangaikondan, a large village, contained 729 households, of which\nabout 100 were Brahman. Although most land belonged to Brahmans, who had\nit cultivated by tenants, they were almost all in debt, so that \u201cthe Brahmans are\ndeteriorating in numbers and prosperity,\u201d whereas people of other castes \u201cshow\nsigns of progress.\u201d Most Brahman men were literate and a few had left the\nvillage for higher education (Slater 1918: 53\u201356, 68, 73). By 1936\u20131937,\nGangaikondan\u2019s Brahmans\u2014now down to seventy-five households\u2014were\nemigrating and losing their lands because they had supposedly \u201cdegenerated\ninto idle rent-receivers;\u201d the \u201cresort to higher, English education\u201d was\n\u201canother drain\u201d (Thomas and Ramakrishnan 1940: 59, 61). The Brahman\ndecline in population and landownership had accelerated by 1960 and still\nfurther by 1983\u20131984, when only thirty-six Brahman households remained\nin the village\u2019s total of 1,344, although, interestingly, a few Brahmans had\nmoved into Gangaikondan after retirement and from other villages whose\nagraharams had been emptied of Brahmans (Athreya 1985: 8\u20139, 11, 15, 18,\n96\u201397, 130).\nThe fertile Kaveri delta makes up most of the old Thanjavur District, where\nBrahmans, many of them wealthy mirasidars, were an unusually high 9 percent\nof the population in the late nineteenth century (Washbrook 1975: 24). Despite\nemigration and land sales, Brahmans in the delta in the 1950s were still \u201cweal-\nthier, more numerous, and more powerful than in any other south Indian dis-\ntrict\u201d (Gough 1981: 27). The most detailed ethnography of any Tamil\nBrahman village is by Gough, who did fieldwork in the delta in Kumbapettai\nin 1951\u20131952 and 1976. Kumbapettai contained 194 households in 1952,\nand 233 in 1976, but Brahman household numbers fell from 36 to 33. The\nnet Brahman decline was therefore small, but there was considerable movement\nin and out. In 1952, the agraharam was exclusively Brahman but, by 1976, it\nalso contained eight non-Brahman families (Gough 1989: 240\u201345). In 2005,\n174 C . J . F U L L E R A N D H A R I P R I YA N A R A S I M H A N\nwhen we visited Kumbapettai briefly, the agraharam housed only six Brahman\nfamilies, who were outnumbered by non-Brahmans. Gough explains that\nbetween 1850 and 1950, \u201cindividual family fortunes waxed and waned\ngreatly\u201d among Kumbapettai\u2019s Brahmans. A few families made money, but\nby 1952 the majority were becoming steadily impoverished, and were losing\nland to more prosperous non-Brahman farmers, merchants, and moneylenders\n(1981: 200\u20131, 242, 247). Declining wealth pushed many Brahmans into emi-\ngrating, and by 1952 fifty-eight men worked outside the village, mostly\nemployed in \u201clower-grade government service,\u201d although a few had higher-\nstatus jobs or ran businesses. Relatives of Kumbapettai\u2019s Brahmans also\nlived in various urban centers in south India, as well as further afield. Many\nemigrants were absentee landlords, although land was sometimes looked\nafter by one family member remaining in Kumbapettai after the others left\n(ibid.: 201, 207, 236\u201338, 299). Between 1952 and 1976, Brahmans sold yet\nmore land, and their local power and authority were collapsing, which encour-\naged further emigration (Gough 1989: 262\u201365, 272\u201374, 311). In 2005, we\nwere told that one important factor is that Brahman landowners cannot\nmanage their farms, because they can no longer exert authority over Dalit\nlaborers.\nIn Sripuram, studied by Be\u00b4teille in 1961\u20131962, the Brahman landlords were\nmostly richer than in Kumbapettai. Sripuram contained 349 households,\nincluding 92 Brahman households in the agraharam, which had no non-\nBrahman residents (Be\u00b4teille 1965: 26). Nonetheless, Brahmans were still\nleaving, so that half the landlords were absentees, and many men were\nselling land, especially to pay for their sons\u2019 education. Brahman power and\nauthority were also in decline by the 1960s (ibid.: 114\u201316, 129\u201331,\n168\u201370). Sripuram\u2019s Brahmans, however, have not fallen as far as might\nhave been predicted, although emigration has continued. In 2005, we found\nthat Brahmans still occupied more than half the agraharam houses; non-\nBrahmans first bought or rented these houses around 1980, but the Brahmans\nhave now decided not to let them have any more. Identical agreements have\nbeen made in other agraharams in the vicinity, but whether they will hold is\nuncertain. Nonetheless, they are a sign that some rural Brahmans are trying\nto reassert old prerogatives and to prevent more cases like Yanaimangalam in\nthe Tambraparni valley, where the agraharam has so many non-Brahman resi-\ndents that it is now the village\u2019s most mixed street instead of its most exclusive\n(Mines 2005: 13).\nTippirajapuram, the Kaveri delta agraharam where we have done ethno-\ngraphic fieldwork, is also still mainly occupied by Brahmans, whose\neighty-two households outnumber the thirteen non-Brahman ones. Tippiraja-\npuram is one of the leading villages of the eighteen-village Vattima subcaste\nof Smarta Brahmans. In smaller Vattima villages, however, the agraharams\nnow house many more non-Brahmans, and some of them Brahmans have\nF R O M L A N D L O R D S T O S O F T WA R E E N G I N E E R S 175\nlargely abandoned. A few of Tippirajapuram\u2019s Brahmans are still large land-\nowners, but a notable feature is the high proportion of them who are retired,\nand whose economically active children live in towns and cities in Tamilnadu,\nelsewhere in India, or overseas, especially America.\nThe ethnographic data reveal many differences between individual villages\nand some possibly systematic variation between the Palar, Tambraparni,\nand Kaveri valley regions. In particular, Brahman decline has probably been\nsteeper in the first two than in the Kaveri valley, especially in the delta. Even\nso, the general direction of change is plain, for the cumulative evidence\nshows that the size of the Tamil Brahman rural population, and the amount\nof land it owned, have hugely decreased over the last hundred years. Further-\nmore, in the wet-zone villages, Brahman social, economic, and political dom-\ninance has mostly disintegrated. Quite rapidly, therefore, a Brahmanical\nagrarian order that lasted a thousand years in the Tamil country fell apart\nduring the twentieth century.\nIn wealth and power, Tamil Brahman mirasidars never matched the great\nlandlords in some other regions, such as the Nambudiri Brahman landlords\nof neighboring Malabar (north Kerala). Even by the standards of pre-modern\nIndia, however, the social structure of Brahman villages in Tamilnadu was\nextremely unequal and exploitative, especially for landless untouchables. Yet\nresistance by any of the lower castes was a relatively minor cause of change.\nInstead, it was overwhelmingly Brahmans themselves who brought about\nthis social revolution in the countryside. Partly \u201cpushed\u201d by indebtedness,\nland sales and loss of local dominance\u2014in which the anti-Brahman movement\nadmittedly did play a significant role after Independence\u2014and partly \u201cpulled\u201d\nby new opportunities in education, salaried employment, or in some cases\nbusiness, Brahmans gave up being lords of the land and decisively migrated\nto the towns and cities.\nG E N E A L O G I C A L E V I D E N C E\nGenealogies provide some insight into this movement for particular individuals\nand families. In Tippirajapuram, genealogies have been collected from seven-\nteen individuals, and the two that we outline briefly and partially here are as\nrepresentative as any of eighteen-village Vattima cases.\nNagalingam, born in 1927, belongs to one of Tippirajapuram\u2019s leading\nlanded families. Both his grandfathers were landlords there; his father qualified\nas an accountant, but did not practice and instead looked after his land,\nwhich Nagalingam has retained. Nagalingam is also an auditor still working\nin the City Union Bank (CUB), which is largely controlled by Vattimas. He\nwent to college in Madras and qualified as a chartered accountant in 1953.\nHe first worked for a central government department in Jaipur and Calcutta,\nand later joined a leading private-sector company, but he fell ill and returned\nto Tippirajapuram in 1963, where he practiced accountancy and worked for\n176 C . J . F U L L E R A N D H A R I P R I YA N A R A S I M H A N\nthe CUB. Nagalingam and his wife have two sons in their forties, both auditors\nin Chennai, and one daughter in her fifties who is a housewife married to a\ndoctor living in Ohio and has three children, all trainee doctors.\nNagalingam\u2019s father had one brother, whose only daughter, Rajalakshmi, also\nborn in 1927, married a landlord, and they have four children, now in their\nfifties. Rajalakshmi\u2019s elder son works for the CUB in Coimbatore and the\nyounger son works in Bangalore for a financial advice and services company\nstarted in Chennai in 1974 by Vasudevan, Rajalakshmi\u2019s younger daughter\u2019s\nhusband, who is also a chartered accountant. Vasudevan\u2019s elder daughter\nis an IT professional living in the United States, his younger daughter is\nmarried to a CUB manager in Kumbakonam, and his son works for his\nfather\u2019s company in Chennai. Rajalakshmi\u2019s elder daughter is married to her\ncross-cousin (once removed), a landlord in another Vattima village, and they\nhave three sons, one working for the same financial company in Mumbai\n(Bombay) and the other two for software companies in Chennai. Nagalingam\u2019s\nfather also had one sister, whose four sons, all born in the 1930s, are respectively\ntwo retired lawyers, who practiced in nearby Kumbakonam and Mayuvaram,\nand two landlords (one just mentioned as married to his cross-cousin). Each\nlawyer had two sons: one works for the CUB in Tirucchirappalli, and three\nare in Chennai, one in a large private-sector company, one in business, and\none an accountant.\nLike Nagalingam\u2019s family tree, Sitaraman and Mahalakshmi\u2019s also displays\na mixture of rural landholders and urban professionals, which is quite typical\namong Vattimas in Tippirajapuram. Sitaraman, born in 1936, is a landlord, as\nwas his father and father\u2019s father. Sitaraman has few close relatives, but his\nwife Mahalakshmi, born in 1944, has a large extended family. Mahalakshmi\u2019s\nfather and father\u2019s father were landlords. She and Sitaraman have three chil-\ndren, all born in the 1960s. Their first daughter, who is widowed, works in\nChennai for the financial company mentioned above, their son works for a\nprivate company in Bangalore, and their younger daughter is a university\nadministrator in Philadelphia, although her husband is a professor in Singapore.\nMahalakshmi\u2019s eldest brother is a retired accountant in Hyderabad; his first son\nis a speech therapist in the United States, and his younger son works for a\nstate-owned oil company in Gujarat. Her second brother is an engineer in a\nprivate company in Chennai; his son, who studied in one of the prestigious\nIndian Institutes of Technology (IIT), and his daughter, an IT graduate, both\nlive in the United States. Her youngest brother is a retired engineer living in\nTirucchirappalli, whose son is employed by a major software company in\nBangalore.\nOn the whole, Vattima mirasidars\u2014like Nagalingam and Sitaraman\u2014have\nprobably stayed in their villages for longer than other landowning Brahmans in\nthe Kaveri delta. Today, though, such landlords are in a minority, because most\nVattima men, especially in the younger generation, live and work in urban\nF R O M L A N D L O R D S T O S O F T WA R E E N G I N E E R S 177\nareas, and nobody expects them to keep their family lands and return to the\nvillage, even after retirement. In Nagalingam\u2019s family, banking and accoun-\ntancy have been common occupations, mostly practiced in Chennai and\nother Tamilnadu towns. Mahalakshmi\u2019s family members have entered a\nwider range of professions and spread further afield. In particular, one of her\nthree children, and three of her five nephews and nieces, live in the United\nStates. Although these genealogies were collected from people still living in\na village, they illustrate a characteristic Tamil Brahman pattern in which\nmen\u2014and in recent years women as well\u2014are normally able to improve on\nor consolidate their forebears\u2019 occupational status. Genealogies thus display\na general tendency towards expansive migratory movement and upward\nsocial mobility.\nWe have collected several other genealogies, from various sources, but will\ndiscuss only one more example: a Sri Vaishnava family from the Kaveri valley\nvillage of Vangal, whose exceptional genealogy, available on a website, con-\ntains more than 1,000 individual names.4\nThiruvengata Chari (1837\u20131934) was a landlord, who had three daughters\n(all married to landlords) and four sons. The eldest son, Srinivasa (1867\u2013\n1932), became a government civil engineer, although he kept his link with\nVangal and built a house there. After Srinivasa\u2019s death, however, the house\nwas given away by his three sons, who all settled in Madras. The eldest of\nthese sons also became a government civil engineer, and the other two\njoined different government departments. (Engineering, as noted below, has\nbecome an important profession for Tamil Brahmans.) Thiruvengata Chari\u2019s\nsecond son, Satagopa (1869\u20131954), became a lawyer in Salem and had four\nsons: one worked for a government department and settled in Tirucchirappalli,\nand two went to Madras, one becoming an oil company executive and the other\nworking for the Reserve Bank of India. On the fourth son there is no infor-\nmation. Thiruvengata Chari\u2019s third son, Ragunatha, married a wealthy contrac-\ntor\u2019s daughter and lived in Srirangam (near Tirucchirappalli).\nThiruvengata Chari\u2019s youngest son was Sir V. T. Krishnamachari (1881\u2013\n1964), who studied law in Madras before entering government service.\nDuring his career, he was variously the dewan (prime minister) of Baroda prin-\ncely state for seventeen years, an Indian delegate to the League of Nations and\nlater the United Nations, and the deputy chairman of the Indian government\u2019s\nPlanning Commission. Krishnamachari had three sons: the eldest became\nAdvocate-General for Madras, the second joined the railways in southern\nIndia, and the youngest became a senior economic advisor to the Indian govern-\nment. Krishnamachari\u2019s two daughters lived in Madras and respectively\nmarried an engineer and a railway officer.\n4 At http:\/\/www.vangalheritage.com\/index.htm. We thank V. L. Vijayaraghavan, compiler of\nthe website, for his assistance.\n178 C . J . F U L L E R A N D H A R I P R I YA N A R A S I M H A N\nIn this Vangal family, three of the four sons of Thiruvengata Chari entered\ngovernment service or the law. Although Srinivasa kept a residence in\nVangal, his two brothers\u2014and all their sons\u2014settled in towns and cities.\nApart from Ragunatha in Srirangam, this family\u2019s menfolk moved into urban\nemployment within one generation and abandoned village life entirely when\nSrinivasa died in 1932. The majority of the numerous descendants of Thiruven-\ngata Chari\u2019s professional sons had, or have, similar urban, professional jobs.\nToday many of them\u2014women now, as well as men\u2014work in IT, banking, or\nother private-sector industries, either in India or overseas (mostly in\nAmerica), and some are employed by the government or public sector in\nIndia. Collectively, their migratory expansion and professional mobility have\nbeen unusually extensive. Eventually, in the 1960\u20131970s, Ragunatha\u2019s descen-\ndants also migrated to towns for employment, but they almost all remain in\nIndia and have been less socially or geographically mobile.\nKrishnamachari belonged to the group of \u201coften lordly but highly efficient\nIndian Dewan[s]\u201d (Low 1978: 378), several of them Tamil Brahmans, on\nwhich the princely states and the colonial government came to rely. Tamil Brah-\nmans had earlier served as state administrators in Hindu Travancore and\nMuslim Mysore (Bayly 1988: 152), so that Krishnamachari continued a tra-\ndition also followed by numerous other Brahmans who entered government\nservice during the colonial period, even if few of them attained high office.\nYet the tradition is really far older, because in all classical authorities on\nHindu kingship, a legitimate, righteous king invariably depends on Brahman\nministers, counselors, and jurists (Lingat 1973: 207\u201323). While such continu-\nities should not be exaggerated, when Tamil Brahmans became bureaucrats and\nlawyers, they were, often consciously, pursuing a path with ancient precedents.\nThis is so even though these professions are governed by modern conceptions\nof knowledge and rationality, and the criteria for recruitment into them were\nsecular educational qualifications, not Brahman birth. Indeed, modern knowl-\nedge and rationality are fundamental to all the professions esteemed by\nTamil Brahmans. These include law, administration, and management, as\nwell as medicine, engineering, and computing, for which the Brahmans\u2019\n\u201cnatural\u201d ability in mathematics\u2014perceived as the preeminent intellectual\ndiscipline\u2014supposedly qualifies them.\nEngineering as a profession for Tamil Brahmans deserves special mention.\nEngineering in colonial India was mainly civil engineering (the branch\nentered by Srinivasa from Vangal and his son), and its development was\nclosely tied to that of the government\u2019s public works departments (PWD)\n(A. Kumar 1995). Indian engineers were excluded from senior official grades\nuntil about 1920, and British prejudices about their professional fitness were\noften voiced (Basu 1991). Nevertheless, Indians did make progress and\nTamil Brahmans were prominent among them. In the Madras PWD, the first\nIndians were appointed as assistant engineers in 1877 (one Brahman and one\nF R O M L A N D L O R D S T O S O F T WA R E E N G I N E E R S 179\nnon-Brahman), as executive engineers in 1890 (one Brahman), and as superin-\ntending engineers in 1920 (two Brahmans and one non-Brahman). In 1925, the\nfirst Indian chief engineer, a non-Brahman, was appointed alongside a Euro-\npean, although in 1935 there were two Brahmans and one European. By\n1900, in all grades, there were sixty-seven engineers, of whom fifty-eight\n(87 percent) were Europeans, eight (12 percent) were Brahmans, and one\n(1.5 percent) was a non-Brahman. Until 1940, the total complement remained\nfairly steady, but European numbers gradually fell after 1920 and non-Brahman\nnumbers rose. Despite some fluctuations, however, Brahmans made up over\n20 percent of engineers from 1925 to 1940, so that they were considerably\nover-represented in the profession, just as they were in administration and\nlaw. Tamilnadu\u2019s historians, however, have rarely mentioned Brahman engin-\neers and the PWD (cf. Irschick 1986: 63\u201364, 69; Saraswathi 1974: 47\u201348).5\nDespite its proximity to mathematics and science in which Brahmans have\nbeen prominent (Arnold 2000: 8, 154), engineering additionally requires\n\u201chands-on\u201d technical skills, which has made it uncongenial for a few Brah-\nmans. The majority, however, have never been deterred, and Tamil Brahmans\nwere the pioneers in engineering in south India\u2014eventually in the mechanical\nand electrical as well as civil branches\u2014and they remain well-represented in\nthe profession. Software engineering is non-manual work in offices, of\ncourse, but the Brahmans\u2019 current prominence in IT is an extension of their\nprior presence in engineering, rather than an entirely new development.\nT H E B R A HMAN S \u2019 \u201c E X O D U S \u201d F R OM RU R A L S O C I E T Y\nNagalingam still has land in Tippirajapuram and is an example of a Brahman\nwho went to the city to study and work, but later returned to his village. He\ndid so for health reasons, but he had never completely turned his back on\nrural life. Certainly, many Brahmans did and do move in and out of villages;\nlandowners are particularly likely to return, as are retired people, but some\nBrahmans move to agraharams conveniently located near towns where they\nwork, as Tippirajapuram is for Kumbakonam. Other Brahmans move to agra-\nharams still dominated by Brahmans, such as Tippirajapuram or Gangaikondan\n(Athreya 1985: 11, 130), because they prefer to live within their own commu-\nnity. Yet Brahmans who return to their villages or move to other ones are in the\n5 The data on engineers in the Madras PWD derive from the annual publication, variously titled\n\u201cIndia List\u201d and\/or \u201cIndia Office List\u201d (London: W. H. Allen or Harrisons). Brahmans can be ident-\nified by their caste surnames\u2014Aiyar, Aiyangar, or (occasionally) Acharya\u2014but in later years a few\nof them may have given up these surnames, so that Brahman totals may be too low. European totals\nmay also be too high, because they may include some Anglo-Indians and Indian Christians. Irschick\n(1986: 69) cites different data on the high proportion of Brahman gazetted officers in the PWD. In\nthe Madras Electricity Department, which became independent of the PWD in 1932, Tamil Brah-\nmans were also disproportionately well represented and the first Indian chief engineer, appointed in\n1944, was a Brahman (personal communication from Srinivasa Rao, IIT-Madras, Jan. 2007).\n180 C . J . F U L L E R A N D H A R I P R I YA N A R A S I M H A N\nminority, which is why so many agraharam houses have been sold or rented to\nnon-Brahmans, or left empty and abandoned. Indeed, a very striking feature of\nTamil Brahman migration to urban areas has been its rapidity and complete-\nness, both at the aggregate level of the caste as a whole, and at the family\nand individual level. Villagers have often become urbanites within the span\nof one generation.\nAccording to Dupuis, in the Palar valley area where Dusi is located, the\nGreat Depression was the decisive factor in starting \u201cthe great exodus\u201d of Brah-\nmans that \u201ctransformed a rural class into an urban class\u201d (1960: 51). Especially\nin the Tambraparni valley, the \u201cexodus\u201d had really started earlier, but Dupuis is\nstill fundamentally right that Tamil Brahmans, through migration, became \u201can\nurban class\u201d in the twentieth century.\nThe Brahmans\u2019 urban transformation was not always easy\u2014as Dupuis\u2019s\nevocative story of a mirasidar and his son who migrated to Madras in the\n1920\u20131930s shows (ibid.: 51\u201358)\u2014but it was plainly facilitated by their\ntypical attitude to agriculture and land. As we have seen, the ownership and\ncontrol of land mattered greatly to Brahman mirasidars for social, economic,\nand political reasons, but they were patriarchal landlords, not farmers com-\nmitted to agriculture as a means of livelihood. They never got down into\ntheir fields. Non-Brahman mirasidars were no different, but modern non-\nBrahman landowners generally have more interest in and commitment to agri-\nculture than Brahmans, and are willing to work in their fields. This is an attitude\nthat they, like Brahman landowners, regard as important for managing Dalit\nlaborers. (We do not know whether Dalits actually interact with Brahman\nand non-Brahman landowners differently.) Nowadays, some Brahman land-\nowners have become modern, capitalist farmers. We have met several Vattimas\nwho are scornful about other Brahman landowners\u2019 managerial incompetence\nand cultivate their wetlands very profitably, and a few similar cases are men-\ntioned by Gough (1989: 277\u201378) and Yanagisawa (1996: 253\u201355). But\nmodern Brahman farmers\u2014new \u201cagrarian citizens\u201d rather than \u201cold gentry\u201d\n(Ludden 1999: 187)\u2014are rare. Moreover, even though most urban residents\nin Tamilnadu are of course non-Brahmans from a wide range of castes, they\nare generally more likely than Brahmans to keep family land, to which they\nmay have a strong emotional attachment, and more likely to sell only if their\nfarms are small and unprofitable. Particularly compared with non-Brahman\npeasant cultivators, therefore, the Brahmans\u2019 detached or even disdainful\noutlook enabled them to quit their lands and rural life relatively easily.\nOf course, adhering to traditional purity rules and religious observances is\nnormally more difficult in urban areas than villages. In a rural agraharam,\nBrahmans can fairly easily control the purity of their food and water, their\nhouses and (in the past) their streets and temples as well, but they find it\nharder in a socially mixed, urban environment. Some agraharams survive in\ntowns and cities, and many Brahmans try to live in streets or apartment\nF R O M L A N D L O R D S T O S O F T WA R E E N G I N E E R S 181\ncomplexes where they form a majority, but living completely separately from\nnon-Brahmans is never feasible. Finding pure well water in cities suffering\nchronic water supply problems is particularly difficult and is one more\nreason why a small minority of very conservative Brahmans still keep away\nfrom urban areas, so that they can conform to orthodox rules.\nA rural agraharam\u2019s separation from the main village also permitted a\ngeneral detachment from all non-Brahman social life, which is singularly illus-\ntrated by an elderly Brahman widow in Sripuram, who told us in 2005 that she\ncame there after marriage in 1946, but has never once entered the non-Brahman\narea of the village next to the agraharam street. Such willful isolation from\nnon-Brahmans is admittedly extreme. Nevertheless, another reason why urban-\nization has generally been easier for Brahmans than non-Brahmans is that the\nlatter\u2014except of course for Dalits\u2014are more fully integrated into local village\ncaste society. As Barnett (1976: 25) explains, the Brahmans\u2019 \u201cposition and\nstatus was independent of their residence in any given local area,\u201d whereas\nfor non-Brahmans, especially higher castes, \u201crank was directly dependent on\nvillage economic and ritual dominance,\u201d so that their urban migration involved\nmovement into a riskier, socially unstable environment. Moreover, in some\nsenses, agraharams never were fully rural spaces, for mirasidars, especially\nBrahmans, \u201ccombined attributes normally assigned either to rustic family\nfarmers or urban elite intellectuals\u201d (Ludden 1985: 94). All in all, therefore,\ndespite the hazards to their purity, the vast majority of Tamil Brahmans have\nmade the changes and compromises needed for urban life fairly easily.\nSignificantly, too, apart from some ambivalent idealization of villages as\npeaceful, pure, or \u201ctraditional,\u201d many Brahmans regard them as unrefined\nplaces inhabited by less educated, less intelligent people. Their attitude is typi-\nfied by the Tamil Brahman who tried to explain that owing to their education\nand \u201cbrain,\u201d \u201cespecially in villages, there are no Brahmins, they come to\ncities, the city is better\u201d (Chuyen 2004: 156). The more sophisticated version\nof the same idea is that the city\u2014specifically Chennai\u2014is a center of the\nBrahman literati\u2019s great tradition (Singer 1972: 62\u201364, passim), as Brahmans\nthemselves also proclaim (Hancock 1999: 64\u201367). In other words, conforming\nto a standard stereotype of the city as more civilized than the village, Brahmans\ntoday typically regard themselves as natural city-dwellers.\nThe overall outcome of the Tamil Brahmans\u2019 exodus from the countryside is\nthat migration and urbanization are fundamental to their modern history and\ncontemporary society, both in reality and in how they imagine and represent\nthemselves. There is and was a normal template for this migration. Initially,\nthere is a one-way movement from the village to an urban area\u2014Chennai or\nanother town in Tamilnadu\u2014for education, employment, or both. This\nmigration frequently inaugurates a rapid process of personal and familial urban-\nization, so that migrants\u2019 sons, who have probably spent all or most of their\nlives in an urban locality, separate themselves from rural life. Urban Brahmans\n182 C . J . F U L L E R A N D H A R I P R I YA N A R A S I M H A N\ntake little or no part in managing their lands, which are either controlled by\nfamily members still living in the village or rented out to tenants; otherwise\nand often, they are sold. Most Brahmans settled in urban areas rarely leave\nthem, so that today village life is an alien experience. Migration, furthermore,\nhas not been impeded by the marriage system, because although most Brah-\nmans have arranged marriages within their caste or subcaste, they have no pre-\nference for marrying locally, as do even some educated, middle-class\nnon-Brahmans, like the Gounders in Tirupur studied by De Neve (n.d.).\nNow, as in the past, urban Brahmans often migrate between towns and\ncities\u2014for example, from a regional town to Chennai or a city elsewhere in\nIndia\u2014and they also often circulate around them, especially when in jobs,\nlike many in government, which require regular transfers. L. Caplan, in a dis-\ncussion of migrant middle-class Christians that also applies to Brahmans, notes\nthe importance of circulation among urban centers, but he emphasizes, too, how\nChennai \u201cattracts and selects migrants in quite a different way from other, less\ndominant, urban localities.\u201d The city is the \u201chub\u201d of the regional economy,\na business, educational, medical, and legal center, the seat of the state govern-\nment, and the Tamils\u2019 cultural capital (L. Caplan 1987: 60). Hence within\nTamilnadu the top of the social mobility ladder is Chennai and, because it is\nthe hub, \u201cBrahman emigrants [are] always present on Chennai\u2019s social and\nspatial horizons\u201d as well (Hancock 1999: 48).\nBy the early twentieth century, Brahmans dominated all grades of the\nbureaucracy, law, and education in the Madras Presidency. This domination\nwas an immediate cause of the rise of the anti-Brahman, Dravidian movement\nand eventually the non-Brahman parties that have ruled Tamilnadu since the\n1960s. Especially after Independence, anti-Brahmanism stimulated the Brah-\nmans\u2019 migration from villages and their emigration out of a state where they\nfaced discrimination. The anti-Brahman movement\u2019s well-documented but\ncontroversial history will not be discussed here, however, except to mention\nBarnett\u2019s insight that the \u201cconflict between the \u2018forward\u2019 Brahmins and the\n\u2018backward\u2019 non-Brahmins . . . might more accurately be defined as a conflict\nbetween a landowning non-Brahmin elite with a history of rural dominance,\nand a nascent urban Brahmin elite that had used the opportunities presented\nby British rule\u201d (1976: 17). The Brahmans\u2019 urbanization, in other words,\nwas a crucial but often overlooked dimension of the emerging opposition\nbetween them and non-Brahmans. In 1921, the colonial government introduced\nmeasures to try to ensure more equitable recruitment, which were the initial\nprecursor of the post-Independence reservations policy. Some Tamil Brahmans\nthen left for other cities, such as Bombay (Irschick 1969: 236, 301), although\nBombay\u2019s economic opportunities were probably more important, since in\npractice the new measures in Madras had hardly any immediate effect. Banga-\nlore was also a favorite destination and, especially after Independence, so was\nDelhi, where many Tamil Brahmans worked in central government services,\nF R O M L A N D L O R D S T O S O F T WA R E E N G I N E E R S 183\nwhich had no caste quotas (except for Scheduled Castes and Tribes). By the\n1960s, 40,000 south Indians lived in Delhi and as many as 75 percent of them\nwere Brahmans (Singh 1976: 61, 158). Either to obtain jobs or because of trans-\nfers, however, Tamil Brahmans have moved all over India and, in the last two or\nthree decades, significant numbers have migrated to foreign countries. All this\ngeographical mobility throughout more than a century means that a large\nproportion of Tamil Brahmans live outside of Tamilnadu. Nevertheless (although\nno statistics exist to prove it), there are almost certainly more of them in Chennai,\nespecially its southern suburbs, than in any other urban area, and many Tamil\nBrahmans regard Chennai as the city that they can most call their own.\nBefore we turn to contemporary Chennai, two important points must be\nadded. First, upwardly mobile middle-class Tamil Brahmans have generally\nmigrated more extensively than their lower-class counterparts. Brahman\nclerks employed in government or banks, or cooks or factory workers, for\nexample, were and are more likely to be fairly stationary within Tamilnadu\nthan those in professional occupations. Secondly, in almost all cases of\nBrahman migration, men, not women, have been the active agents. Men\ndecide to move for education and employment, and their wives and families\naccompany them. Similarly, parents encourage or permit sons, rather than\ndaughters, to move away from home for education or employment. In recent\nyears, however, daughters have often enjoyed the same educational opportu-\nnities as sons and, particularly in the IT industry, young women are often as\nmobile as their male colleagues. But during most of the period discussed\nhere the great majority of Tamil Brahman women moved only at the behest\nof husbands or other male kin. This is graphically illustrated by several\nfamily histories published recently (Gulati 2005; Kamakshi 2005; Raj 2005;\nSundaram 2005; Sivaraman 2006).\nB R A HMAN S A N D M I G R AT I O N I N C O N T EM P O R A RY C H E N N A I\nIn 2003, when we told middle-class Brahmans in Chennai about our research\non globalization, they often replied that it mainly meant overseas migration,\nespecially to America, and that \u201cevery\u201d Brahman family today has members\nabroad. People said, too, that overseas migration is a middle-class \u201ccraze\u201d or\n\u201cobsession\u201d encouraged by the new IT industry. In fact, though, overseas\nmigration began earlier, and by the early 1980s, among the upper-middle-class\npeople in Chennai studied by P. Caplan, many of them Brahmans, \u201cthere [was]\nscarcely a family that does not have a close relative who has migrated [abroad]\u201d\n(1985: 58).\nIn our research, we also found that many, though not all, middle-class\nBrahmans have relatives living overseas. Foreign emigration, however,\nusually only adds to a family\u2019s history of movement within India, and circula-\ntion owing to job transfers is a significant aspect, as illustrated by several inter-\nviews done in 2003\u20132005 with Tamil Brahmans living in the middle-class,\n184 C .

Transfers every few years are the norm for bank\nofficers, for example, and in the 1970 and 1980s employment in banks\u2014which\nwere nationalized in 1969\u2014was attractive to Tamil Brahmans partly because\nTamilnadu\u2019s reservations policy was making it harder to get jobs and pro-\nmotions in state government services. Just three examples from our interviews\nare summarized here.6\nLeela and Malini are friends in their forties. Leela is a housewife, and her\nhusband Siva, from Madurai, is a retired bank officer. They have lived in\nvarious places in Tamilnadu, as well as in Calcutta. They have two daughters\nand share their apartment with Siva\u2019s unmarried brother, a computer engineer.\nAnother brother, a lawyer, still lives in Madurai. Leela was raised in\nKumbakonam and is one of seven children. One of her brothers and two\nsisters also live in Chennai, another sister is in Thanjavur, and one brother\nand one sister work in Dubai. The son and daughter of one sister live in the\nUnited States. Malini belongs to the community of Palghat (Tamil)\nBrahmans, who settled in north Kerala centuries ago, and she is a Hindi\nteacher. Her husband is Venkat, also a bank officer, and they have a son and\na daughter. They had recently moved to Chennai from Calcutta, and before\nthat had lived in Lucknow, Ahmadabad, Mumbai, and Bangalore. Venkat\ncomes from Thanjavur. Malini grew up in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, where\nher father worked in a central government ordnance depot. Malini has three\nbrothers, with whom she has little contact. She has no close relatives abroad,\nalthough one nephew spent a few years as a lecturer in the United States.\nThe third woman, Deepa, is also in her forties, and was born in Mumbai. She\nworks for a bank in Chennai, has a son who is a student in the city\u2019s IIT, and a\ndaughter. Her husband Arjun, also from Mumbai, is a bank manager. He and\nDeepa worked in Bangalore before arriving in Chennai. Deepa has lived in\nChennai for nearly twenty years, and when Arjun was transferred to Mumbai\nshe stayed in Chennai with the children so that their education would not be\ndisrupted. Arjun now works for a new, private-sector bank, and when their\ndaughter enters college Deepa will seek a transfer to Mumbai to rejoin him.\n6 In the research in Chennai in 2003\u20132005, thirty-four interviews were done in T. Nagar with\nmiddle-class individuals (or families), twenty of them Tamil Brahman. We also interviewed\nthirty-eight IT professionals (including twenty-six Tamil Brahmans), mostly in major software\ncompanies, and eleven managers and engineers in manufacturing companies (including four\nTamil Brahmans). Within each category, a few people of unidentified caste may also have been\nTamil Brahmans. Further interviews were done with teachers and a variety of other informants.\nIn the research on Vattimas in 2005\u20132007, Tippirajapuram was the main fieldwork site, but\nother Vattima villages were visited. Interviews were also done with Tippirajapuram residents\u2019 rela-\ntives in Chennai, and other cities in India and the United States. In the Chennai middle-class\nresearch, and to some extent among urban Vattimas, the \u2018snowball\u2019 technique of locating people\nfor interview had to be used, so that our sample of informants was a tiny, haphazard fraction of\nthe potential universe. In any qualitative ethnographic study of an urban middle class, this methodo-\nlogical problem is normally unavoidable.\nF R O M L A N D L O R D S T O S O F T WA R E E N G I N E E R S 185\nDeepa has several cousins living in the United States, and at the time of the\ninterview her son was deciding between offers of a job in a major Indian soft-\nware company and a postgraduate place in an American university.\nNone of these three women is truly typical, but the geographical movement\nand distribution of their family members do exemplify a collective experience\nand shared social history that any middle-class Brahman in Chennai would find\nfamiliar. Foremost in this experience and history is a combination of uni-\ndirectional migration\u2014from village to town, from Tamilnadu to elsewhere in\nIndia, from India to a foreign country\u2014and circulation between Chennai and\ndifferent urban centers in Tamilnadu and India as a job demands. Normally,\nmen move for work and their wives accompany them, even if they also have\npaid employment. Some women, however, are becoming more self-assertive\nand do not always go with their husbands, especially if they have children in\nschool. Sometimes, too, children stay with their grandparents so that their edu-\ncation is not disrupted. Yet many children do move a lot and it is common to\nmeet Tamil Brahmans in Chennai who have spent first their childhood and\nthen their working lives all over Tamilnadu and India, so that they have\nlived in the city for only a short time.\nThese peripatetic Brahmans may know Indians from many regions and they\nsometimes mention their diverse friends and colleagues. Visvanathan, for\ninstance, who is retired, was born in Kerala and studied in Chennai, and he\nreminisced about his long career with colleagues from all over India in the\npublic-sector steel plant in Rourkela, Orissa, in something akin to the Nehru-\nvian style discussed for the Bhilai plant by Parry (2003: 221\u201323). Visva-\nnathan\u2019s son, whose wife comes from Delhi, works in Chennai and his\nmarried daughter lives in Delhi, and in his family they can speak Tamil,\nMalayalam, Hindi, Bengali, Oriya, and English. Many friends in Rourkela\nwere Bengalis and Visvanathan and his wife became so used to celebrating\nthe Durga Puja festival that they still feel obliged to visit a Bengali association\u2019s\nshrine for the goddess in Chennai each year.\nYet people may tend to eulogize India\u2019s diversity more when they are back in\nChennai than they did before. For instance, Punjabi landlords in Delhi prefer\ntheir mainly Brahman south Indian tenants over fellow Punjabis because\nthey pay their rent on time, but this is partly because the southerners find Pun-\njabis intimidating and aggressive. Nor are other prejudices about language or\nskin color dissolved by regular social interactions between the two groups\n(Singh 1976: 77, 79). In Delhi, too, most friendships among Tamil Brahmans,\nor other south Indians, tend to be within their own group (ibid.: 104\u20138), and\nanecdotal evidence suggests that this is common everywhere. On the other\nhand, Visvanathan and his wife\u2019s interregional friendships are not unique to\nthem. Moreover, linguistic chauvinism is particularly rare among Tamil Brah-\nmans; many speak several languages and those raised outside Tamilnadu some-\ntimes know Hindi or another Indian language better than Tamil. Almost all\n186 C . J . F U L L E R A N D H A R I P R I YA N A R A S I M H A N\nmiddle-class men, as well as many women and children, also speak English\nmore or less fluently. Whether circulation through transfers has \u201cprovided the\ncement to assemble national imaginations\u201d (Gidwani and Sivaramakrishnan\n2003: 348) is hard to say, but it has certainly made people more aware of diver-\nsity and probably reduced regional parochialism.\nI N F O RMAT I O N T E C H N O L O G Y P R O F E S S I O N A L S\nThe numerous IT professionals with a middle-class Brahman background have\nthe same collective experience and shared social history. The IT industry is\ndominated by the young and only a handful of senior people are over forty.\nBy looking at people of different ages, however, we can discern some of the\neffects of the industry\u2019s evolution, which is actually tending to reduce, rather\nthan increase, overall geographical mobility.\nIndia\u2019s largest software and services company, Tata Consultancy Services\n(TCS), was established in Bombay in 1968. In the 1970s, TCS began to obtain\nbusiness in the United States, which quickly expanded there and elsewhere\nduring the 1980s. Many young men working for TCS in the early years were\nTamils, particularly Brahmans, and two of them were Ratnam and Krishna.\nRatnam, who is in his fifties, runs his own very small software company in\nNanganallur, near Chennai. He comes from a humble background in Sriran-\ngam, where he attended a government, Tamil-medium school. He then\nstudied mathematics at a college in Madurai before going to IIT-Madras for\nhis master\u2019s degree. In 1972, Ratnam joined TCS in Bombay and was soon\nsent to Boston and then Portland, Maine, where he worked for Burroughs\nunder the American computer company\u2019s agreement with TCS. After several\nyears, Ratnam resigned from TCS and moved to California, where he\nworked for fifteen years before returning to Nanganallur in the late 1990s to\nestablish his own company. Most of its business comes from the United\nStates with the assistance of his American partner and friend in California.\nRatnam was a first-generation migrant from Srirangam via Madurai to\nChennai and then Bombay, followed by America, and he has hardly moved\naround in India at all, unlike Krishna.\nKrishna, who is slightly younger than Ratnam, runs his own small software\ncompany with his wife Indu in Chennai. His father\u2019s father was a priest and\nlandlord in Chengalpattu, not far from the city, who lost a lot of money. Krish-\nna\u2019s father was therefore raised in a poor family, but he eventually secured a job\nworking for the army in Poona. He then worked for the railways, first in Poona\nand afterwards in Madras. Krishna\u2019s mother\u2019s father, the son of a landlord who\nhad gone bankrupt, worked as a stenographer in the Madras High Court, but\nmoved to Delhi in 1948. Because his father was being transferred between\nrailway centers, Krishna lived with his maternal grandparents in Delhi, so\nthat he could have a stable education in one of the city\u2019s Madrasi schools\n(Singh 1976: 56\u201357). His sister remained in Madras.\nF R O M L A N D L O R D S T O S O F T WA R E E N G I N E E R S 187\nKrishna returned to Madras to study electronics in Guindy Engineering\nCollege (later Anna University) and then completed a master\u2019s degree in IIT-\nKharagpur, West Bengal. After working for two years in the public-sector\nsteel plant at Bokaro, Bihar, he decided that the job was \u201cstale\u201d and moved\nto Bombay in 1978 to join TCS. His father was \u201caghast\u201d at Krishna\u2019s reckless\nresignation from a secure, well-paid, government job. Krishna worked for TCS\nin Bombay for three years and then on a client\u2019s project in the Netherlands for\ntwo years. In 1983, he married Indu, a doctor\u2019s daughter from Bangalore with a\ndegree in botany. Their only son was born in 1984 and has recently completed\nhis degree at an English university. In 1983, TCS sent Krishna to Chicago to set\nup their operation there, but in 1988 he and his family returned to India, partly\nto be closer to his retired, widowed father. He joined Wipro (another major\nIndian software company) in Bangalore, but left in 1990 to establish his own\ncompany, which was relocated to Chennai in 1999. Krishna\u2019s new venture\nhad Indu\u2019s full support, although his father now disapproved of his resignation\nfrom the safety of TCS.\nUntil 1978, Krishna and his forebears had followed a prototypically Tamil\nBrahman route from penurious ex-landlord status, to bureaucratic employment\nin Madras, Poona, and Delhi in the next generation, to Krishna\u2019s education in\nGuindy and Kharagpur, followed by a job as an engineer in Bokaro. Before he\nwas thirty and went to Bombay, Krishna had already lived in many different\nplaces, but when he joined TCS he sharply deviated from what was then a\ntried and trusted Tamil Brahman career path, and he did so again when he\nset up his own company. Like other people in the software industry, including\nRatnam, Krishna decries what he sees as Brahman risk aversion and hostility to\nbusiness, although many Tamil Brahmans actually have set up IT companies\nduring the last decade (cf. Chuyen 2004: 153). Even if his risk taking was\ndeviant, however, Krishna\u2019s career movements\u2014to Bombay, Europe, and\nAmerica\u2014merely extended his earlier mobility and paralleled the migration\nto the west then being undertaken by many Tamil Brahman professionals.\nThe most significant innovation in both Ratnam\u2019s and Krishna\u2019s movements\nwas their return migration from America to India, which was made possible by\nthe development of the Indian IT sector. Most people in Chennai agree that\nthere is more talk than action about return migration, but it does now occur,\nas it rarely did before the 1990s. In the global labor market for software engin-\neers, opportunities to obtain well-paid work are fairly abundant, so that tempor-\nary movement abroad is quite common. Importantly, though, many IT\nprofessionals in Chennai\u2014as well as Bangalore (Upadhya and Vasavi 2006:\n117\u201318)\u2014now say that they do not want to emigrate, because career prospects\nand living standards are comparable with those in the west. Ratnam, indeed,\nsaid that if he were a young man today, he would not go to America. Moreover,\nalthough overseas project assignments remain part of the job in all major IT\ncompanies, the industry\u2019s evolution means that more work is now done\n188 C . J . F U L L E R A N D H A R I P R I YA N A R A S I M H A N\n\u201coffshore\u201d in India rather than \u201con-site\u201d at foreign clients\u2019 offices. Thus young\nIT professionals today usually spend less time abroad than TCS pioneers like\nRatnam and Krishna.\nThese points can be illustrated by referring to five Tamil Brahman software\nengineers in their thirties, whom we have discussed elsewhere (Fuller and Nar-\nasimhan 2007: 128\u201331; 2008). All five are now project managers or assistant\nmanagers in one major Indian software company in Chennai, which we call\nIndian Computer Services (ICS). Ravi, Balaram, Anuradha, and Jayashree\nwere mainly or wholly brought up in Chennai. Lakshmi comes from Palayam-\nkottai in southern Tamilnadu. Ravi and Jayashree have master\u2019s degrees in\ntechnology from the IITs in Kharagpur and Chennai, respectively, and\nBalaram has one in computing from a university in Hyderabad. Anuradha\nand Lakshmi have only first degrees in engineering from colleges in Coimba-\ntore and Madurai, respectively.\nAfter Kharagpur, Ravi first worked in Calcutta before joining ICS in Chennai\nin 1995. Ravi, accompanied by his wife, has spent one year working on a project\nin England. Were it not for his elderly father, Ravi might have stayed away for\nanother year, but he does not want to settle abroad. Balaram had various jobs\nbefore joining ICS in 1994, but he resigned in 1995 to go to Australia with his\nfamily, where he worked in the IT sector until he rejoined ICS in 2003.\nBalaram has also worked in Britain and America, and ICS sent him to Ireland\nin 2004. Anuradha first worked for two different software companies in\nChennai, for one of which she did project work in Britain and America. She\nthen moved with her husband to America, working there for ICS between\n2000 and 2002, before returning to Chennai. Jayashree had a couple of jobs in\nIT in Chennai before she and her husband left to earn money in 1992. They\nwent to Hong Kong for two-and-a-half years, where she did contract work, fol-\nlowed by sixmonths in Singapore, and then returned toChennaiwhere Jayashree\njoined ICS. Since returning to Chennai, neither Anuradha nor Jayashree have\nbeen abroad again on project assignments for ICS. Lakshmi moved to\nChennai when she got a job with ICS in 1995. In 2003, without her family,\nshe went to Britain for a three-month project, her only stay abroad.\nRavi and Jayashree, like Ratnam and Krishna before them, studied at IITs,\nbut this elite educational background is now unusual among software engin-\neers. Because software engineering in companies like ICS or TCS has progress-\nively become more routinized and reliant on standard packages, IIT graduates\nare over-qualified and can secure more technically demanding, better-paid jobs.\nNowadays, most new recruits in major software companies have only a bache-\nlor\u2019s degree in engineering, usually from one of the leading engineering\ncolleges in Tamilnadu. Some young people leave the state to study engineering,\nbut out of twenty software engineers under thirty (not all Brahmans) on whom\nwe have information, only three have done so. One is a peculiarly well-\nqualified Brahman who studied in both IIT-Madras and the Indian Institute\nF R O M L A N D L O R D S T O S O F T WA R E E N G I N E E R S 189\nof Management in Calcutta, and the other two are Brahmans who went to the\nwell-regarded Birla Institute of Technology and Science in Pilani, Rajasthan.\nAll the rest stayed in Tamilnadu, and the main reason why they could do so\nis that young men and women, including Brahmans, can nowadays obtain\ngood engineering education in the state, which in turn enables the best gradu-\nates to get well-paid, high-status jobs in Chennai\u2019s top IT companies.\nThese companies (unlike banks, for example) rarely transfer staff between\ndifferent offices in India. As we have seen, though, overseas work is\ncommon, and although Lakshmi has been away for only one short project\nassignment, Ravi, Balaram, Anuradha, and Jayashree, in one way or another,\nhave all spent longer abroad. Only Balaram, however, has acquired as much\noverseas experience as Ratnam and Krishna did in the IT industry\u2019s early\nphases. Among our twenty younger software engineers, seven had been or\nwere on overseas assignments in 2005; two had spent more than one year in\nthe United States, but the rest, as is now increasingly common, were away\nfor only a few months. Those who had not been abroad all hoped to go\nsoon, because overseas assignments are important for career progress\u2014they\nprovide good \u201cexposure\u201d through new opportunities and experiences (Fuller\nand Narasimhan 2006; Upadhya and Vasavi 2006: 116)\u2014and attractive for per-\nsonal reasons. Rarely, though, do they lead to permanent settlement abroad as\nNon-Resident Indians (NRI), as has been common for many Tamil Brahman\n(and other Indian) professionals since the 1970s.\nIn sum, therefore, Chennai\u2019s development into a nodal city in the globalized\ninformational economy, together with the IT industry\u2019s evolution so that more\nwork is done offshore in India, have helped to reduce overseas migration by\nsoftware engineers, including the many Tamil Brahmans among them. This\nreduction, as well as decline in the exploitative practice of \u201cbody-shopping\u201d\n(van der Veer 2005: 279\u201383), may look surprising, but in fact it is not,\nbecause the very logic of \u201coffshoring\u201d means that flows of people may diminish\nas the work travels to the site of labor, instead of the reverse.\nAccording to Castells, the \u201ccosmopolitan\u201d \u201cmanagerial elites\u201d of global\ncapitalism share \u201can increasingly homogeneous lifestyle\u201d and \u201can international\nculture . . . not linked to any specific society\u201d (1996: 415, 417). Maybe IT pro-\nfessionals in Chennai do not really belong to Castells\u2019 managerial elites, but\nwhen seen by their computers in their offices, which look like those anywhere\nin the world, such claims about uniform, transnational lifestyles, cultures, and\nspaces separated from their local surroundings appear plausible. Nonetheless,\na critical study of Indian migrant software engineers in the United States,\nwhich shows that \u201ca homogeneous and undifferentiated diasporic class\u201d is a\ntheoretical illusion that ignores the salience of the migrants\u2019 class and caste\nbackgrounds (Mir, Mathew, and Mir 2000: 25\u201331), is salient within India as\nwell. And although Hannerz endorses the concept of occupational transnational\ncultures, he comments that they tend to be organized to make Europeans and\n190 C . J . F U L L E R A N D H A R I P R I YA N A R A S I M H A N\nAmericans \u201cfeel as much at home as possible,\u201d whereas for everyone else,\n\u201cinvolvement with one of the transnational cultures is more likely in itself to\nbe a distinctive cultural experience\u201d (1996: 107). This certainly applies to IT\nprofessionals in Chennai, for they are fully aware of their work culture\u2019s dis-\ntinctiveness, for example, its relatively egalitarian gender relationships\n(Fuller and Narasimhan 2008: 195\u2013200). They are also cognizant about how\ndifferent foreign cultures actually are, which is why they emphasize the import-\nance of \u201cexposure\u201d to them. But north and south India are different, too, so that\nthe maximal exposure abroad differs only in degree from the exposure else-\nwhere in India. Through mobility, therefore, IT professionals (or other\npeople, like transferred bank officers) acquire an experiential competence in\nother cultures (or subcultures). This could be classified as cosmopolitanism\n(Hannerz 1996: 103) or national sensibility, or both, for in any large country\nthese apparent opposites may be continuous with each other.\nAs we have already seen, however, whether anything beyond a reduction in\nparochialism occurs among mobile Tamil Brahmans is unclear. For ordinary\nlabor migrants, comments Hannerz, \u201cthe involvement with another culture is\nnot a fringe benefit but a necessary cost, to be kept as low as possible\u201d\n(ibid.: 106). Not surprisingly, hardly any Tamil Brahmans eat snails to demon-\nstrate cosmopolitanism (ibid.: 104); more often, they worry about how to find\npure vegetarian food, so that stories of software engineers in carnivorous\ncountries who survived on nuts or vegetarian stock cubes are common currency\namong them. Of course, many are more relaxed, like the Vattima IT pro-\nfessionals (and some, but not all, of their wives) who told us in America that\nthey had adjusted fairly easily to life and work there. But neither they nor\nthe vast majority of Tamil Brahmans, even in the global IT industry, have\nbecome transnational cosmopolitans; rather, they are \u201cespousing a new form\nof global nationalism, or nationalist globalism,\u201d and overseas they tend to\n\u201ccling\u201d to Indian cultural values \u201cas a means of maintaining their sense of\nself\u201d (Upadhya and Vasavi 2006: 119, 120).\nC O N C L U S I O N\nEconomic growth in Tamilnadu means that since the 1990s employment oppor-\ntunities have expanded not only in IT, but also elsewhere in the private sector\nwhere no reservations exist. Thus Brahmans generally feel under less pressure\nthan before to leave Tamilnadu to find good jobs. Steadily declining anti-\nBrahmanism in the state, as well as the continuing value of the Brahmans\u2019 \u201ccul-\ntural capital,\u201d have also eased their position (Fuller 1999: 35\u201337). Brahmans\nhave not stopped moving, of course. Nevertheless, staying in Tamilnadu,\nespecially in Chennai, is now more likely to be the most rational strategy,\neven for ambitious young Brahmans, than it has been for fifty or more years.\nBrahmans are obviously not the only Tamils who migrate, although the mer-\ncantile banking caste of Nagarattars (Nattukkottai Chettiyars) (Rudner 1994)\nF R O M L A N D L O R D S T O S O F T WA R E E N G I N E E R S 191\nare almost certainly the sole Tamil community whose mobility matches the Brah-\nmans\u2019. There is, though, a pertinent comparison with Anglo-Indians. Among\nAnglo-Indians in Chennai, who complain like Brahmans about the reservations\nsystem and mostly see their prospects as dim, there is a \u201c\u2018spirit\u2019 of emigration\u201d\n(L. Caplan 2001: 130) and \u201cthe issue of emigration looms large in [their] con-\nsciousness\u201d (ibid.: 134). Elite Anglo-Indians may prefer to stay in India, but\n\u201cthe great majority\u201d regard \u201cemigration overseas as the only way to alleviate a\nlife of hardship and despair for individuals and families\u201d (ibid.: 152).\nAnglo-Indians have suffered from worse discrimination than Tamil Brahmans,\nbut a comparable spirit of emigration, albeit less desperate, existed among\nmany Brahmans until it diminished in recent years. Thus for Brahmans, the\nwheel has in a sense come full circle, which it has not done for Anglo-Indians.\nLike the Tamil Brahmans, the small Chitrapur Saraswat Brahman caste in\nKanara, on the west coast, whose members migrated to Madras, Bombay,\nand other towns in the late nineteenth century, became \u201ca caste on the move\u201d\n(Conlon 1977: 174). By the 1930s, the Saraswats were increasingly urbanized\nand dependent upon urban employment, Bombay being the main center of\nsettlement (ibid.: 201). Telugu Brahmans also migrated to Madras in sizeable\nnumbers, and in the city, and its IT industry, they are still a significant minority.\nIndeed, in most regions during the colonial period, Brahmans\u2014together with\nNayars from Kerala in the Madras Presidency, Kayasths and Baidyas in\nBengal, Parsis in Bombay, and some other groups\u2014tended to move to urban\nareas for education and employment in government and the professions.\nApart from Conlon\u2019s study of the Saraswats, however, little beyond generalities\nis available to assess how distinctive the Brahmans of Tamilnadu were or are in\ntheir patterns of migration and urbanization.\nWe end with a very different comparison. In his study of modern Jews, Slez-\nkine broadly distinguishes between \u201cservice nomads\u201d or \u201cMercurians\u201d and the\ndominant, settled population or \u201cApollonians.\u201d \u201cModernity was about every-\none becoming a service nomad: mobile, clever, articulate, occupationally flex-\nible, and good at being a stranger\u201d (Slezkine 2004: 30), and the Jews \u201ccame to\nrepresent Mercurianism and modernity everywhere\u201d (ibid.: 39). We shall not\nevaluate this bold assertion, but the comparison between Russian Jews, Slez-\nkine\u2019s main subject matter, and Tamil Brahmans is suggestive. Brahmans,\nplainly, were never marginalized and persecuted like Jews, and Chettiyars,\nnot Brahmans, were prominent in south Indian banking and business. Yet,\nunless they emigrated overseas, Russian Jews, similarly to Tamil Brahmans,\nmigrated to towns and cities a century ago and, as a small minority, they\nalso became disproportionately well-represented in education and the pro-\nfessions, as figures for Jewish graduates and professionals in Moscow and\nLeningrad in the 1920s illustrate (ibid.: 105, 116\u201317, 223\u201325). The outcome\nin the early twentieth century was that the \u201cJews were becoming modern\nfaster and better than . . . anybody else in Russia\u201d (ibid.: 153).\n192 C . J . F U L L E R A N D H A R I P R I YA N A R A S I M H A N\nWhether Tamil Brahmans were becoming \u201cmodern\u201d like Russian Jews raises\nserious conceptual problems, but specifically in relation to urban migration,\nmodern education, and professional employment, they were ahead of other\nsouth Indian communities and were starting to turn themselves into service\nnomads for the twentieth and eventually the twenty-first centuries. Notwithstand-\ning the teleology, their history suggests that they were destined to become urba-\nnites, who would move outward from Tamilnadu to the rest of India and\noverseas, as soon as the conditions allowed or required it. The Tamil Brahmans\u2019\nunusual adaptability and successful exploitation of new opportunities are what\nmake them sociologically interesting and, as we said earlier, education is often\nemphasized as the key explanatory factor. Yet education and the employment\nfor which it provides credentials have also been both cause and effect of the\nmigration and urbanization that have been formative for the mobile Tamil\nBrahmans\u2019 success in the modern world, not least as software engineers in an\nindustry whose development may now encourage them finally to stop moving.\nR E F E R E N C E S\nArnold, David. 2000.
