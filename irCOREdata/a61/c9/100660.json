The isomer decays into a rotational band which is associated\nwith the two-quasiparticle 92 isomer at 75.3 keV. Analysis of the branching ratios within that band and the\nmagnetic moment for the 92 isomer, supports the configuration assignment to the 92 isomer. The K hindrance\nfor the E2 decay of the 152 isomer to the 92 band is substantially lower than that for an apparently similar\n152 isomer in 178Ta, a difference which can be attributed partly to a change from the p9\/22@514#n39\/21\n@624#7\/22@514#5\/22@512# configuration in 178Ta to the p39\/22@514#7\/21@404#5\/21@402#n9\/21@624# con-\nfiguration in 180Ta.

INTRODUCTION\nInterest has focused recently on the production of the iso-\ntope 180Ta in stellar processes ~e.g., @1\u20134#! and therefore on\nits structure. 180Ta is one of the least abundant stable iso-\ntopes and the only one which occurs naturally in an isomeric\nstate. Its 12 ground state has a shorter half-life ~8.1 h! than\nthe Kp 5 92 isomeric state at 75.3 keV which lives for more\nthan 1.231015 y. The uncertainty of its production in nature,\nits possible candidature as the basis for an x-ray laser and\nevidence that excitation by bremsstrahlung can occur from\nthe 92 isomer to higher ~but unidentified! states which also\nhave substantial decay widths to the ground state @5,6#, lead-\ning to propositions of as yet unexplained K mixing @7,8#\nbetween states at intermediate energies, underlines the need\nfor firm spectroscopic data. Only fragmentary information is\navailable @9#, mainly from particle transfer studies, inelastic\nphoton scattering and b decay. Information from g-ray spec-\ntroscopy is very limited because the extremely low natural\nabundance of 180Ta disqualified it from detailed study\nthrough Coulomb excitation, at least until recently @10#, and\nits proximity to stability makes it difficult to reach easily\nwith heavy ion, xn reactions with stable beams, which\nfavour production of neutron-deficient isotopes.\nAs part of systematic spectroscopic studies of a range of\ntantalum isotopes (179Ta being the heaviest accessible by re-\nactions that involve only neutron evaporation with at least\nmedium spin inputs! significant production of 180Ta was\nachieved through the 176Yb(11B,a3n)180Ta reaction in a\nbombardment whose main reaction channel proceeds via\nevaporation of four neutrons to 183Re. The purpose of the\npresent communication is to report on the identification and\nproperties of a long-lived isomer whose decay reveals part of\nthe 180Ta level scheme.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS\nEnriched targets of metallic 176Yb of thickness 4.6\nmg\/cm2 were bombarded with pulsed 11B beams from the536\/53~3!\/1205~5!\/$10.00ANU 14UD accelerator at a range of energies, the optimum\nfor four-neutron evaporation being approximately 55 MeV.\nGamma-gamma-time measurements were carried out using\nthe six Compton suppressed detectors which make up the\nCAESAR array, together with two LEPS detectors. For these\nexperiments the beams were adjusted to give ;1 ns wide\npulses separated by 1.7 ms. All correlated g-g-time events\nwithin 6856 ns were recorded and analyzed with different\ntime-difference conditions.\nA. Isomer decay and partial level scheme\n1. Out-of-beam coincidences\nThe lowest panel of Fig. 1 shows g rays in prompt coin-\ncidence with a 431.7 keV transition, with the additional con-\nstraint that all g rays occurred between beam pulses, thus\nselecting only transitions that are initially fed by an isomer.\nThe 431.7 keV transition was subsequently assigned as the\nmain branch directly from a high-spin isomer, as confirmed\nby gates on transitions assigned as band members, examples\nof which are shown in the figure. The isomer also decays via\na weaker 142.4 keV branch. ~Because of the time conditions,\nhigh sensitivity was obtained even though population of the\nisomer is only ; 12% of the 180Ta yield, which itself is only\n; 7% relative to the 182,183Re products.!\n2. Lifetime\nTo establish the lifetime of the isomer, which was found\nto be long compared to the conditions used in the g-g-time\nmeasurements, g-time measurements using chopped beams\nwith time width\/separations ranging from 0.1 ms\/1.7 ms to 1\nms\/17 ms were explored. The times of all g rays were mea-\nsured in a resettable ADC clock which could be interrogated\nwhenever a g ray was detected, avoiding effects which nor-\nmally limit such measurements when time-to-amplitude con-\nverters are employed. A representative time spectrum com-1205 \u00a9 1996 The American Physical Society\n1206 53G. D.

The main compo-\nnent is attributed to a 45~2! ms meanlife.\n3. Assignment to 180Ta\nAssignment to 180Ta was made after considering a range\nof information; prompt coincidences between the main tran-\nsitions and characteristic tantalum x rays as shown in Fig. 1;\nFIG. 1.

Note that the relative g-\ng-time condition here is 610 ns, which reduces the efficiency at\nlow energies.

Partial level scheme and spins\nThe proposed decay path of the isomer in 180Ta is shown\nin Fig. 3. The main rotational sequence of states is defined\nclearly through the observation of cascade and crossover\ntransitions and the appropriate g-g coincidence relation-\nships. The band populated is assumed to be based on the\n92 isomer at 75.3 keV, consistent with the intensity observed\n~this band should be yrast! and with previous information\nfrom particle transfer studies @12# which gave an ~imprecise!\nenergy separation of 203 keV between candidate 102 and\n92 states, to be compared with the precise 203.0 keV tran-\nsition observed here.\nFrom the delayed intensity balances, the 142.4 keV tran-\nsition which feeds the suggested 142 member of the 92\nband has a total conversion coefficient of aT 5 1.8~3!, con-\nsistent only with M1 multipolarity, and suggesting Jp\n5152 for the 1451 keV state. The main branch from the\nisomer is then by a 431.7 keV E2 transition to the 132 state.\nThis interpretation gives an internally consistent result for\nboth the spin and decay branches of the isomer and the iden-\ntification of the 92 band itself.\nIII. INTERPRETATION\nA low-lying, long-lived four-quasiparticle 152 isomer\nwith a similar decay pattern is known @13# in 178Ta although\nit has a very long meanlife of 84~3! ms @11,13#.

Configuration of the Jp 5 92 band\nThe 92 intrinsic state has previously been attributed @14#\nto the configuration p9\/22@514# n9\/21@624#, a proposition\nwhich can be tested further by examining the rotational band\nstructure identified here. The g-ray branching ratios l from\neach state can be used to deduce the (gK-gR)\/Q0 values as\ngiven in Table I, from the formulas for strongly coupled ro-\ntational bands, proceeding through a calculation of the cas-\ncade mixing ratios:\n1\nd2\n5\n1\nl FEg~I!I22 !Eg~I!I21 !G\n5 ^IK20uI22K&2\n^IK20uI21K&2 21, ~1!\ngK2gR\nQ0 5\n1\nd\n0.933Eg~I!I21 !\nAI221\n, ~2!\nwhere Eg is in units of MeV and Q0 is in units of eb.\nAs can be seen from the table, consistent independent\nvalues are obtained for each member of the band. Values of\ngK can be extracted and compared with the value calculated\nusing the Nilsson model and the additivity relation\nKgK5(gV iV i , if the quadrupole moment Q0 and the rota-\ntional g factor, gR , can be estimated.\nThe value calculated from the Nilsson model is gK~92) 5\n0.53, which agrees with the values obtained experimentally\nfor (gK-gR)\/Q0 if Q0;7.0 and gR;0.30, as can be deduced\nfrom the last column of Table I. The quadrupole moment of\n180Ta has not been measured but the moment is known pre-\ncisely for a number of bands in 181Ta and for the 21 state in\n178Hf as compiled in @15#, all of which suggest Q0\n57.0(1) eb. Assumption of the same value in 180Ta gives,\nfrom the present measurements ~Table I!, a mean value of\n(gK-gR) 5 0.331~10!.\nSince the magnetic moment of the 92 isomer has been\nmeasured independently \u0084as 4.77~5! mN @14# corresponding\nto a gyromagnetic ratio of 0.530~6!\u0085, it can be used in the\nformula\ng5gR1~gK2gR!\nK2\nI~I11 ! ~3!\nto extract a value of gR 5 0.23~1!. This rather low value\ncompared to an expected value of about 0.7Z\/A50.28 de-\npends, of course, on the assumption that the quadrupole mo-ment in 180Ta is the same as it is in the neighbors. If that is\nsubstantiated, and if other bands in 180Ta yield the same\nvalue, the low magnitude of gR will need explanation.\nSince the rotational band spacing is also indicative of the\npresence in the configuration of particles which experience\nCoriolis mixing, it is useful to examine the band in terms of\nthe rotational alignment. As shown in Fig. 4, the alignment in\nthe 92 band in 178Ta is consistent with the presence of the\n9\/21@624# neutron, judging by the comparison with the\nalignment in the 9\/21@624# band in the isotone 179W @16#.\n~For clarity only the a511\/2 signature is shown for the odd\ncases.! The alignment in 180Ta is significantly lower, but that\nis again consistent with the expectation of lower Coriolis\nmixing and therefore lower alignment as the neutron Fermi\nlevel reaches the upper part of the i13\/2 neutron shell, as\nexemplified by the low alignment observed @17# for the\n9\/21@624# band in the isotone, 181W.\nB. Decay strengths and configuration of the 152 isomer\nUnfortunately, the relatively long lifetime obtained for the\nnew isomer makes it difficult to identify directly, rotational\nband states based on it and therefore probe its configuration,\nhowever, its decay properties also give an indication of its\nconfiguration, as shown below. While the states in 178Ta and\n180Ta have clear similarities, the strength of the 431.7 keV\nE2 transition connecting the 152 isomer and the 92 band is\nconsiderably larger than the analogous 227 keV transition in\n178Ta , which has a partial g-ray lifetime Tg of 101~4! ms\n@13,11#.\nFor a transition of multipole order l , the reduced\nK-hindrance factor per degree of K forbiddenness, f n , where\nn5DK2l , is defined as\nFIG. 4. Alignment curves for the 92 bands in 178Ta and 180Ta\ncompared to the 9\/21@624# bands in the isotones 179W and 181W.\n1208 53G. D.

The lifetime in 178Ta corresponds to an E2\nhindrance, f 5 4.4310 6, and therefore a reduced hindrance\nof f n 5 46.\nWhile the shorter lifetime in 180Ta arises partly because\nthe E2 transition is higher in energy and partly because the\ndifference in excitation energies enables a transition to the\n142 band member, a decay path which is not possible in\n178Ta, it is significantly shorter than expected. The partial\ng-ray lifetime for the 432 keV transition in 180Ta is 60~5!\nms, which corresponds to f56.73104 and f n 5 16, a much\nlower hindrance than in 178Ta.\nK mixing might lower the hindrances but such mixing\nshould be less in 180Ta, as evidenced by the lower alignments\nand therefore lower Coriolis mixing as pointed out above.\nThe difference is attributed instead to a specific change in\nconfiguration. Multiquasiparticle calculations similar to\nthose reported recently @18# predict two possible 152 states\nin 178Ta, one from the p9\/22@514# n39\/21@624#7\/22\n@514#5\/22@512# configuration ~which we abbreviate to\npn3), the other from the p39\/22@514# 7\/21@404#5\/21 @402#\nn9\/21@624# configuration ~or p3n). These will be consid-\nered below as a 92, pn configuration coupled to 61 states\nin the even-even hafnium core.\nAlthough the former of the 152 configurations is initially\ncalculated to be somewhat lower, both are predicted to be\nclose in energy after residual interactions are included, and\nthus an ambiguity arises as to which corresponds to the ex-\nperimental state. In either case, some mixing would be ex-\npected. In 178Ta, recent measurements of the properties of a\nrotational band based on the 152 isomer give gK-gR values\nwhich suggest the pn3 configuration is dominant but possi-\nbly with some admixture @11#. The p3n state is calculated to\nbe lower in 180Ta mainly because of the change in single\nquasiparticle energies. The essential difference between the\ncompeting configurations is whether the @61# core is from an2 or a p2 configuration, coupled to the same pn@92# com-\nponent. The corresponding 61 core states in the hafnium\nnuclei are well recognized as cases where mixing occurs be-\ntween the alternative configurations, and importantly, mixing\nwhich varies with neutron number.\nOne result of that is a difference in E2 decay strengths to\nthe K50 ground state band in the even-even cores. In\n176Hf where the 61 isomer ~9.5 ms! is believed to be 61%\np2, 39% n2 ~e.g., @19#! the E2 decay @19# has f n 5 42, while\nin 178Hf where the configuration is nearly pure p2 @20# the\nisomer is relatively short-lived ~78 ns! @21# and the equiva-\nlent E2 decay has f n 5 16. The parallel between 176,178Hf\nand 178,180Ta can be extended to 174Hf and 176Ta. In the\nlighter nucleus, 176Ta, the pn component couples to 82\nrather than 92 because of the shift in the neutron Fermi level\ntowards the 7\/21@633# orbital, leading to a 142 isomer at\nabout 1373 keV @22# with a p3n configuration and an E2\ndecay with f n;15. This can be compared with the E2 decay\nfor the 61 isomer in 174Hf ~92% p2 @20#! which has\nf n;17 in line with the proposed analogy.\nThe difference in hindrances therefore support a probably\ndominant p3n configuration, for the new 152 isomer in\n180Ta, matching the 61, p2 configuration in the 178Hf core.\nAn open question relates to the explanation of the quantita-\ntive relationship between the configuration admixtures and\nthe hindrance factors. In this context the new results for\n180Ta serve also to underline the relatively high hindrance of\nthe decay of the 152 isomer in 178Ta, a property which can\nalso be correlated with its relatively low energy compared to\nthe yrast line @23#.\nCalculations of the spectrum of intrinsic and collective\nstates in 180Ta, constrained in part by the new results pre-\nsented here, will be required to evaluate propositions about\nthe behavior of low- and high-K states at medium excitation\nenergies.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe are grateful to Dr. M.
