The Lorentzian\nintensity profile is characterized by an appropriately generalized Petermann factor, a renormalized\npeak position, and the cold-cavity resonance lifetime \u0393. The theory also delivers a relation of \u0393\nto the laser threshold that improves earlier phenomenological expressions even for the case of a\nhomogeneous medium.\nPACS numbers: 42.55.Sa, 05.45.Mt, 42.50.Lc, 42.50.Nn\nBreit-Wigner theory is a cornerstone of the study of\nopen quantum systems and finds numerous applications\nfrom atomic and nuclear physics to mesoscopic transport\nand optical or acoustical resonators. This perturbative\ntheory starts from the isolated situation and delivers a re-\nlation between the total scattering cross section and the\nresonance linewidth \u2206\u03c9. Because of its perturbative na-\nture, Breit-Wigner theory breaks down for moderately\nopen systems. A context which is particularly suited\nto explore the ensuing new physics are lasers, which are\nknown to emit light around a sharply defined frequency\n\u03c9\u00af with a Lorentzian intensity profile,\nI(\u03c9) =\n1\n2pi\nI\u2206\u03c9\n(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9\u00af)2 +\u2206\u03c92\/4 . (1)\nHere I =\n\u222b\nd\u03c9 I(\u03c9) is the total output intensity. The\nlinewidth is ultimately limited by the spontaneous emis-\nsion of photons. For almost lossless resonators, the\nSchawlow-Townes formula relates the quantum-limited\nlinewidth \u2206\u03c9ST = \u03932\/2I to the total output intensity I\nand the cold-cavity decay rate \u0393 [1]. This prediction is\nbased on Breit-Wigner theory, and amounts to one spon-\ntaneously emitted noise photon per cavity mode. The\nexplicit factor of 1\/2 accounts for the amplitude suppres-\nsion of field fluctuations due to the active feedback of the\nmedium, and is absent below the lasing threshold.\nThat the sensitivity to quantum noise increases for\nmore open resonators was first realized by Petermann\n[2], who considered gain-guided semiconductor lasers. He\npredicted that the linewidth is enhanced by a factor of\nK \u2265 1 such that \u2206\u03c9 = K\u03932\/2I. Siegman [3] developed\na general framework to study open-sided resonators with\na paraxial mode structure and arrived at the expression\nK0 =\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u222b |\u03c80|2dr\u222b \u03c820dr\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u22232 (2)\nwhich relates the Petermann factor to the inverse con-\ndition number of the transverse resonance wavefunction\n\u03c80. This establishes a direct connection to a mathemat-\nical measure of mode nonorthogonality. Subsequently,\nseveral groups demonstrated the excess noise in experi-\nments on various open-sided resonator geometries with\ndifferent cross-section [4\u20138].\n 0\n 0.01\n 0.02\n-3 -2 -1  0  1  2  3\n\u2206\u03c9\n2  \nI(\u03c9\n)\n\u03c9\/\u2206\u03c9\nexact\ntheory\nK0\nK=1\nFIG. 1: (Color) Inset: the white circles indicate the dielectric\ninterfaces of an annular resonator with radii R2 = 0.6R1 and\neccentricity d = 0.22R1. The refractive index in the inner disk\nis n2 = 3.3, while in the annular region Ren1 is fixed to 1.8.\nThe color-coded density plot shows a TM-polarized resonator\nmode at its threshold (n1,0 = 1.8 \u2212 i0.029, \u03c90R1 = 6.45).\nMain panel: frequency-resolved intensity close to the thresh-\nold (suitably scaled to be independent of the small detuning\nof Imn1). The exact numerical result (solid black curve) is\na Lorentzian whose width and height can be accurately de-\nscribed using the theory developed in this paper (solid red\ncurve on top of the black curve) [Eq. (3) with parameters de-\ntermined from Eqs. (4)-(7) (TM polarization)]. A discrepancy\nin the height is observed when the Petermann factor is deter-\nmined from the homogeneous expression K0, Eq. (2) (dashed\nblue curved), or when it is completely neglected (dotted blue\ncurve, corresponding to the Schawlow-Townes result).\nThe past decade has seen the development of a new\nclass of microlasers, in which the confinement is due to\ninternal reflection at dielectric interfaces [9\u201316]. The typ-\nical feature size s is often not much larger than the op-\ntical wavelength \u03bb. Due to their shape, these resonators\nsupport effectively two-dimensional, highly non-uniform,\nanisotropic modes which are of a decisively non-paraxial\ncharacter. These systems are currently under intense\nexperimental and theoretical investigations. Until very\nrecently, however, the consequences of mode nonorthog-\nonality have been ignored. Models based on random-\n2matrix theory [17\u201320] only partially account for the struc-\ntured wave patterns of typical microresonators. The first\nsteps into this direction have been taken in recent nu-\nmerical investigations of stadium billiards [21] and spirals\n[22], which focus on the case of two cross-talking modes\n[23] and demonstrate that the Petermann factor can be\narbitrarily large even for high-Q modes. Experiments on\nthis subject have just picked up [24]. Therefore, there is\na demand for a systematic theory of mode nonorthogo-\nnality and its consequences for the quantum noise that\naccounts for the specific features of dielectric microres-\nonators.\nIn this paper I fill this gap and develop a theory of the\nfrequency-resolved light emission that applies to general,\nnonparaxial modes in such resonators and furthermore\nadmits spatial non-uniformity of the dielectric constant\nand the gain (I assume single mode lasing and there-\nfore also ignore degeneracies of lasing modes). The re-\nsult entails that formally, the concept of the Petermann\nfactor emerges only in the limit of a small wavelength\n(or a large resonator), \u03bb\/s \u00bf 1. In reality, however, the\nrelations given below already work for relatively small\nresonators (for illustration see Fig. 1, which presents re-\nsults for an annular microresonator where both the di-\nelectric constant as well as the gain are nonuniform.) The\nLorentzian intensity profile can then be parameterized by\na few characteristic parameters,\nI(\u03c9) =\nK\n2pi\n\u03932 + 4\u03b4\u03c92c\n(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c90 \u2212 \u03b4\u03c9)2 +\u2206\u03c92\/4 . (3)\nThis result contains an appropriately defined Petermann\nfactor in the form of a generalized condition number,\nK =\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u222b |\u03c80|2 Imn20 dr\u222b \u03c820 Imn20 dr\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u22232 (TM polarization), (4a)\nK =\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u222b |\u2207\u03c80|2 Imn\u221220 dr\u222b (\u2207\u03c80)2 Imn\u221220 dr\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u22232 (TE polarization), (4b)\nwhere n0 is the complex refractive index at threshold,\nand \u03c80 is the associated resonance wavefunction. The\nresonance frequency at threshold is denoted by \u03c90. Below\nthreshold, the linewidth is given by\n\u2206\u03c9 = \u22122 Im\u03c90\n\u222b\n\u03c820n0(n0 \u2212 n) dr\u222b\n\u03c820n\n2\n0 dr\n(TM), (5a)\n\u2206\u03c9 = 2 Im\n\u222b\n(\u2207\u03c80)2n\u221230 (n0 \u2212 n) dr\n\u03c90\n\u222b\n\u03c820 dr\n(TE), (5b)\nwhere n is the refractive index at the working point.\n(Throughout this work the vacuum speed of light c \u2261 1;\nabove threshold, the linewidth is further reduced by a\nfactor of 1\/2 [25], as in the Schawlow-Townes case.) The\ntheory also predicts a systematic line shift\n\u03b4\u03c9 = \u03c90Re\n\u222b\n\u03c820n0(n0 \u2212 n) dr\u222b\n\u03c820n\n2\n0 dr\n(TM), (6a)\n\u03b4\u03c9 = \u2212Re\n\u222b\n(\u2207\u03c80)2n\u221230 (n0 \u2212 n) dr\n\u03c90\n\u222b\n\u03c820 dr\n(TE), (6b)\nwhich is of the same order as the linewidth and generally\nonly disappears for large resonators filled with a homoge-\nneous medium. The cold-cavity characteristics \u0393 and \u03b4\u03c9c\nare obtained from the relation \u03b4\u03c9c \u2212 i\u0393\/2 = \u03b4\u2126c where\n\u03b4\u2126c = i\n\u03c90\n\u222b\n\u03c820 Imn\n2\n0 dr\n2\n\u222b\n\u03c820n\n2\n0 dr\n(TM), (7a)\n\u03b4\u2126c = \u2212i\n\u222b\n(\u2207\u03c80)2 Imn\u221220 dr\n2\u03c90\n\u222b\n\u03c820 dr\n(TE). (7b)\nAs a notable side product, the latter expressions general-\nize and improve the common phenomenological relation\nImn0 = \u2212(2\u0393\/\u03c90)Ren0 (TM) between the cold-cavity\nlifetime and the laser threshold of homogenous systems.\nAll considerations in this paper are based on the\neffective-medium approach, where the geometric and\nmaterial-specific properties of a dielectric microresonator\nare described by a position-dependent refractive index\nn(r). Let us assume n(r) = 1 outside the resonator. In-\nside the resonator the refractive index can be complex,\nwith Imn < 0 in the amplifying (active) regions of the\nmedium. For an effectively two-dimensional resonator,\nthe classical electromagnetic field is represented by a\nscalar wavefunction \u03c8(r;\u03c9) which fulfills the Helmholtz\nequation [26]\nL\u03c8(r;\u03c9) = 0, L = \u2206+ \u03c92n2(r) (TM), (8a)\nL = \u2207n\u22122(r)\u2207+ \u03c92 (TE). (8b)\nConsider the case that Ren(r) is fixed while Imn(r)\ncan be controlled via pumping. At the laser threshold\nImn(r) \u2261 Imn0(r), Eq. (8) admits a solution \u03c80 satis-\nfying purely outgoing boundary conditions with real an-\ngular frequency \u03c90. Below the laser threshold, the res-\nonance frequency \u2126 associated to this solution becomes\ncomplex, where \u22122 Im\u2126 = \u03b3 is the decay rate. The\ncold-cavity decay rate \u0393 is obtained for Imn = 0 (the\ncomplex cold-cavity resonance frequency is denoted by\n\u2126c = \u03c9c \u2212 i\u0393\/2).\nQuantum optics adds spontaneously emitted photons\nto this picture, which are generated and amplified by\nthe active medium. Even in absence of external illumi-\nnation, the resonator then emits photons of frequency\n\u03c9 \u2248 Re\u2126. A convenient quantum-optical framework to\nstudy this radiation is provided by the input-output for-\nmalism, which delivers the output intensity [19, 27]\nI(\u03c9) =\n1\n2pi\ntr (S\u2020S \u2212 1 ) (9)\nin terms of the scattering matrix S(\u03c9) of the classical field\n(assuming complete population inversion in the medium).\nFor the cold cavity the scattering matrix is unitary, and\nthe passive resonator does not emit any radiation. For\na finite gain the scattering matrix departs from unitar-\nity because the particle flux is no longer conserved due to\nthe stimulated emission of photons in the active medium.\nEven if the cold-cavity resonances are strongly overlap-\nping for the cold cavity (as is typical for low-Q modes\n3with \u0393 larger than the mode spacing), well-resolved res-\nonances appear when one steers the system close to the\nlaser threshold. Dielectric microresonator design aims\nto support high-Q modes, which can be resolved even\ndeep below threshold [21, 24]; in that case, however, the\nthreshold is reached more quickly than in the case of low-\nQ modes. Both cases can therefore be approached by\na systematic expansion around the threshold condition\n[28], which delivers the output intensity\nI(\u03c9) =\n1\n2pi\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u222b |\u03c80|2 Imn20 dr\u222b \u03c820n20(\u03c9\/\u03c90 + n\/n0 \u2212 2) dr\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u22232 (TM), (10a)\nI(\u03c9) =\n1\n2pi\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u222b |\u2207\u03c80|2 Imn\u221220 dr\n\u03c90(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c90)\n\u222b\n\u03c820 dr+\n\u222b\n(\u2207\u03c80)2 n\u2212n0n30 dr\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n2\n(TE).\n(10b)\nThis expression formally diverges at the complex fre-\nquency \u2126 = \u03c90 + \u03b4\u2126 where\n\u03b4\u2126 = \u03c90\n\u222b\n\u03c820n0(n0 \u2212 n) dr\u222b\n\u03c820n\n2\n0 dr\n(TM), (11a)\n\u03b4\u2126 = \u2212\n\u222b\n(\u2207\u03c80)2n\u221230 (n0 \u2212 n) dr\n\u03c90\n\u222b\n\u03c820 dr\n(TE), (11b)\nThe output intensity is hence a Lorentzian [Eq. (1)]\nwhose center \u03c9\u00af = Re\u2126 is displaced from \u03c90 by a sys-\ntematic line shift \u03b4\u03c9 = Re \u03b4\u2126 [see Eq. (6)], which is\ngenerally of the same order as the width \u2206\u03c9 = \u22122 Im \u03b4\u2126\nof the Lorentzian [see Eq. (5)]. The latter can be related\nto the total intensity I =\n\u222b\nI(\u03c9) d\u03c9 via the relation\n\u2206\u03c9 =\n1\nI\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u03c90 \u222b |\u03c80|2 Imn20 dr\u222b \u03c820n20 dr\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u22232 (TM), (12a)\n\u2206\u03c9 =\n1\nI\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u222b |\u2207\u03c80|2 Imn\u221220 dr\u03c90 \u222b \u03c820 dr\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u22232 (TE). (12b)\nThis expression contains integrals similar to those in the\nexpression forK0 [Eq. (2)], but weighted by the refractive\nindex. Moreover, instead of the transverse mode profile,\n\u03c80 now represents the resonance wavefunction in the res-\nonator plane, which encodes the full, non-paraxial mode\nstructure. At this point, the integral in the denominator\nis not restricted to the interior of the resonator, and the\nresult does not feature the cold-cavity decay rate. For\nthe latter reason Eq. (12) cannot be used to extract a\ngeneralized Petermann factor.\nIn order to make contact with the conventional theory\nof the linewidth we now consider the regime \u03bb \u00bf s of a\nlarge resonator. Under this condition, typical resonances\nhave a small cold-cavity decay rate, \u0393\u00bf \u03c90, and the laser\nthreshold is attained at a small gain, | Imn0| \u00bf Ren0.\nEquation (11) then applies all the way down to the cold-\ncavity limit, and can be further recast to deliver the\ncomplex cold-cavity resonance frequency \u2126c = \u03c90 + \u03b4\u2126c,\nwhere \u03b4\u2126c is given by Eq. (7). This result is perturba-\ntive in the gain but nonperturbative in the openness of\nthe system, which is encoded in \u03c90, n0, and \u03c80. Note\nthat in Eq. (7), the numerator is determined by the ac-\ntive region, while the denominator also depends on the\npassive regions \u2014 including the region outside the res-\nonator, where integrals are well defined because n is\nreal [29]. For homogeneous systems, the simple relation\n\u2126c = \u03c90 + i( Imn0\/Ren0)\u03c90 (TM) is often applied (this\nalso entails the relation for the laser threshold discussed\nabove). In comparison to Eq. (7), this simple expression\nis only valid when one can ignore to the exterior contri-\nbution to the denominator, which in practice requires a\nvery large system size.\nWith Eq. (7), linewidth (12) simplifies to\n\u2206\u03c9 =\n\u03932 + 4\u03b4\u03c92c\nI\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u222b |\u03c80|2 Imn20 dr\u222b \u03c820 Imn20 dr\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u22232 (TM), (13a)\n\u2206\u03c9 =\n\u03932 + 4\u03b4\u03c92c\nI\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u222b |\u2207\u03c80|2 Imn\u221220 dr\u222b (\u2207\u03c80)2 Imn\u221220 dr\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u22232 (TE),(13b)\nwhich features the cold-cavity decay rate \u0393 = \u22122 Im \u03b4\u2126c\nalong with the cold-cavity line shift \u03b4\u03c9c = Re \u03b4\u2126c. (Far\nabove the laser threshold, the linewidth is again halved\nbecause amplitude fluctuations are suppressed by the\nnonlinear feedback with the medium [25]). The Peter-\nmann factor, hence, takes the form of Eq. (4). For TM\npolarization, the conventional form [Eq. (2)] of the Pe-\ntermann factor is recovered when the active medium fills\nthe resonator homogeneously (so that n0 does not de-\npend on position). This conceptual relation hence applies\neven when the mode structure in the resonator plane is\nstrongly non-paraxial. This is also the case for TE po-\nlarization or an inhomogeneous medium, where Eq. (4)\nrelates the excess noise to an appropriately generalized\nmeasure of mode nonorthogonality (satisfying K \u2192 1 in\nthe limit of a closed resonator). For an inhomogeneous\nmedium, Eq. (4) shows that the excess noise is generated\nin the active regions (where Imn0 6= 0).\nModel system. In order to assess the predictive power\nof the above analysis I turn to a paradigmatic example\nof a microresonator with a nonuniform refractive index,\nwhich at the same time displays a rich variety of res-\nonator modes. This is provided by the annular microres-\nonator geometry, defined by two eccentric circular inter-\nfaces such as indicated in the inset of Fig. 1. In order\nto exploit the full generality of the formalism presented\nabove, I assume that the gain is constrained to the annu-\nlar region between these interfaces ( Imn1 \u2261 \u2212in\u02dc), but\nvanishes in the interior disk ( Imn2 = 0), and further-\nmore set Ren1 = 1.8 and Ren2 = 3.3. The radii of the\ntwo circles are related by R2 = 0.6R1, and the eccen-\ntricity is d = 0.22R1. The finite eccentricity breaks the\nrotational symmetry and hence leads to nonintegrable\nclassical ray dynamics. The classical phase space ac-\ncommodates domains of stability embedded into regions\nof chaotic instability and, hence, exhibits the full com-\nplexity of generic dynamical systems. The corresponding\nwave dynamics reflect this complexity in a rich set of res-\nonance wavefunctions, which also includes examples with\n4a highly directional far-field radiation pattern [30, 31].\nNumerical techniques make it possible to investigate\na large number of modes, especially in the interesting\nregime where \u03c90R1 is moderately large [30]. Here I focus\non a representative example of a resonator mode with TM\npolarization, which reaches its threshold at n\u02dc0 = 0.029,\n\u03c90R1 = 6.45. In the main panel of Fig. 1, the solid black\ncurve shows the intensity profile close to threshold (for a\nsmall detuning of n\u02dc), which is directly obtained from Eq.\n(9) via a numerical computation of the scattering matrix.\nThe curve is scaled so that it becomes independent of the\ndetuning when n\u02dc\u2212 n\u02dc0 is small. The red curve is obtained\nfrom the theory developed in this work: a Lorentzian of\nform (3), where the parameters are determined by Eqs.\n(4)-(7) (for TM polarization). This curve lies on top of\nthe black curve so that the latter is barely visible. The\ntheory of this paper hence applies even though the res-\nonator is only moderately larger than the wavelength.\nThe other curves illustrate the necessity to adopt the re-\nsults developed in this paper. The dashed blue curve is\nobtained when the Petermann factor is taken of the ho-\nmogeneous formK0 [Eq. (2)], while the dotted blue curve\nshows the result when mode nonorthogonality is entirely\nignored (as in Breit-Wigner theory, which delivers the\nShawlow-Townes formula) [32].\nFor completeness I remark that in the case of a homo-\ngeneous circular disk resonator (corresponding to R2 =\n0), Eq. (2) applies. In polar coordinates, the radial de-\npendence is given by Bessel functions, while the con-\nstraint on time-reversal symmetry singles out modes with\na standing-wave angular dependence sin(m(\u03c6\u2212\u03c60)) [30].\nFor TM polarization and \u03c9R\u00c0 1, Petermann factor (2)\nthen takes the asymptotic form K = sinh2 x\/x2 where\nx = 2 Im (n\u03c9R1) and therefore approaches unity for\nmodes with a large Q factor.\nIn summary, I have explored the consequences of mode\nnonorthogonality in dielectric microresonators for the\ngeneral case of a highly non-paraxial mode structure\nand nonuniform material properties. This theory leads\nto an appropriately generalized Petermann factor [Eq.\n(4)]. Compact expressions (3)-(7) can be used to inform\nthe interpretation of experiments beyond the simple ef-\nfective phenomenological models employed to date. An\nopen question (beyond the illustrative example of Fig. 1)\nthat can be pursued on basis of these expressions is how\ncomplex quantum dynamics (regular versus chaotic wave\npatterns) express themselves in the mode nonorthogonal-\nity.\nThis work was supported by the European Commission\nvia Marie-Curie Excellence Grant No. MEXT-CT-2005-\n023778 (Nanoelectrophotonics).\n[1] A.

The analysis exploits that near\nresonance, the outgoing radiation is dominated by the\nresonance wavefunctions, \u03c8 \u2248 \u03c80. To be specific, let us\nconsider a disk C of radius R\u2192\u221e that completely covers\nthe resonator, so that outside the disk n(r) = 1. Using\npolar coordinates r, \u03d5 in a coordinate system with origin\nat the center of the disk, a basis of scattering wavefunc-\ntions is then given by\n\u03c6(\u03c3)m (r, \u03d5;\u03c9) = H\n(\u03c3)\nm (\u03c9r)e\ni\u03c3m\u03d5, (A1)\nwhere H is the Hankel function and m = 0,\u00b11,\u00b12, . . ..\nThe index \u03c3 takes the value \u03c3 = + for outgoing scattering\nstates while \u03c3 = \u2212 for incoming scattering states.\nThe expansion of the scattering wavefunction in the\nbasis (A1) defines, respectively, the in- and outgoing scat-\ntering amplitudes am and bm,\n\u03c8(r) =\n\u2211\nm\n[\nbm\u03c6\n(+)\nm (r, \u03d5) + am\u03c6\n(\u2212)\nm (r, \u03d5)\n]\n. (A2)\nAdopting a vector notation the amplitudes are related\nvia the scattering matrix S, b = Sa, which is found by\nmatching the scattering states to solutions of Eq. (8a) in-\nside the disk. The expansion coefficients of the resonance\nwavefunction in the scattering region are denoted by b0.\nThe following considerations rest on a consequence of\nthe divergence theorem,\u222b\nC\ndr\u03c81\u2206\u03c82 =\n\u222b\nC\ndr\u03c82\u2206\u03c81+\n\u222e\n\u2202C\nd\u03d5R\n[\n\u03c81\n\u2202\u03c82\n\u2202r\n\u2212 \u03c82 \u2202\u03c81\n\u2202r\n]\n,\n(A3)\nwhich holds for arbitrary well-behaved functions \u03c81, \u03c82,\nand the orthogonality property\u222e\n\u2202C\nd\u03d5R\n[\n\u03c6(\u03c3)m\n\u2202\u03c6\n(\u03c3\u2032)\nm\u2032\n\u2202r\n\u2212 \u03c6(\u03c3\u2032)m\u2032\n\u2202\u03c6\n(\u03c3)\nm\n\u2202r\n]\n= 4i(\u03c3\u2032 \u2212 \u03c3)\u03b4m,m\u2032\n(A4)\nof the scattering basis functions (\u2202C denotes the circu-\nlar boundary of the disk C, which eventually moves to\ninfinity).\nDue to time-reversal symmetry, the scattering matrix\nis symmetric, S = ST . To see that this symmetry holds\nfor complex n, consider two arbitrary solutions \u03c81, \u03c82\nof the Helmholtz equation, and apply the definition of\nthe scattering matrix as well as Eqs. (A3) and (A4) to\nevaluate\n\u22128iaT2 (S \u2212 ST )a1 =\n\u222b\nC\n(\u03c82L\u03c81 \u2212 \u03c81L\u03c82) dr = 0. (A5)\nClose the resonance, the outgoing radiation will be\ndominated by the characteristics of the resonant state.\nHence, S \u2248 \u03b1b0bT0 , where \u03b1 diverges at the resonance so\nthat other outgoing wave components can be ignored.\nThe evaluation of the coefficient \u03b1 requires to compute\nthe overlap between the resonance wavefunction \u03c80 and\nan arbitrary near-resonant solution \u03c8 \u2248 \u03c80, which also\npossesses a small incoming component. Assume that \u03c8\nis normalized so that the dominant outgoing radiation is\ndescribed by the amplitudes b0. The scattering matrix\nthen takes the form S \u2248 b0bT0 \/(bT0 a), while the intensity\nbecomes\nI \u2248 1\n2pi\n|b\u20200b0|2\n|bT0 a|2\n. (A6)\nIn both expressions the denominator is independent of\nthe choice of the near-resonant wavefunction \u03c8:\n\u22128ibT0 a =\n\u222b\n[\u03c80(\u2206\u03c8)\u2212 \u03c8(\u2206\u03c80)] dr\n\u2248\n\u222b\n\u03c820(n\n2\u03c92 \u2212 n20\u03c920) dr, (A7)\nwhere in the last step we used the Helmholtz equa-\ntion. As we are close to resonance, n2\u03c92 \u2212 n20\u03c920 \u2248\n2n20\u03c9\n2\n0(\u03c9\/\u03c90 + n\/n0 \u2212 2).\nWe now once more exploit time-reversal symmetry, this\ntime in the form that \u03c8\u22170 provides a purely incoming so-\nlution of the Helmholtz equation where n0 \u2192 n\u22170. There-\nfore,\n\u22128ib\u20200b0 =\n\u222b\n[\u03c80(\u2206\u03c8\u22170)\u2212 \u03c8\u22170(\u2206\u03c80)] dr\n=\n\u222b\n|\u03c80|2(n20 \u2212 n\u221702)\u03c920 dr. (A8)\nEquation (10a) now follows from Eqs. (A6), (A7),\nand (A8). The techniques described above can also be\nadapted to modes with TE polarization which are gov-\nerned by the Helmholtz equation (8b); this then results\nin Eq. (10b).\n6APPENDIX B: COMPARISON TO OTHER RESONATOR MODES\n 0\n 0.002\n 0.004\n 0.006\n-3 -2 -1  0  1  2  3\n\u2206\u03c9\n2  \nI(\u03c9\n)\n\u03c9\/\u2206\u03c9\n\u03c90R1=5.27\n Im n1,0=-0.0279\nexact\ntheory\nKSP\nK=1\n 0\n 0.01\n 0.02\n-3 -2 -1  0  1  2  3\n\u2206\u03c9\n2  \nI(\u03c9\n)\n\u03c9\/\u2206\u03c9\n\u03c90R1=6.45\n Im n1,0=-0.0291\nexact\ntheory\nKSP\nK=1\n 0\n 0.01\n 0.02\n 0.03\n-3 -2 -1  0  1  2  3\n\u2206\u03c9\n2  \nI(\u03c9\n)\n\u03c9\/\u2206\u03c9\n\u03c90R1=7.01\n Im n1,0=-0.0319\nexact\ntheory\nKSP\nK=1\n 0\n 0.05\n 0.1\n-3 -2 -1  0  1  2  3\n\u2206\u03c9\n2  \nI(\u03c9\n)\n\u03c9\/\u2206\u03c9\n\u03c90R1=7.41\n Im n1,0=-0.0494\nexact\ntheory\nKSP\nK=1\n 0\n 0.01\n 0.02\n-3 -2 -1  0  1  2  3\n\u2206\u03c9\n2  \nI(\u03c9\n)\n\u03c9\/\u2206\u03c9\n\u03c90R1=7.56\n Im n1,0=-0.0252\nexact\ntheory\nKSP\nK=1\n 0\n 0.1\n 0.2\n-3 -2 -1  0  1  2  3\n\u2206\u03c9\n2  \nI(\u03c9\n)\n\u03c9\/\u2206\u03c9\n\u03c90R1=8.00\n Im n1,0=-0.0474\nexact\ntheory\nKSP\nK=1\n   \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \nFIG. 2: (Color) Same as Fig. 1, but for other resonator modes of the annular resonator.
