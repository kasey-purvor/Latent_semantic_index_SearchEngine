One is the \nconventional quantum Hall effect, characteristic of two-dimensional semiconductor systems \n[1,2], and the other is its relativistic counterpart recently observed in graphene, where \ncharge carriers mimic Dirac fermions characterized by Berry\u2019s phase S, which results in a \nshifted positions of Hall plateaus [3-9].  Here we report a third type of the integer quantum \nHall effect. Charge carriers in bilayer graphene have a parabolic energy spectrum but are \nchiral and exhibit Berry\u2019s phase 2S affecting their quantum dynamics. The Landau \nquantization of these fermions results in plateaus in Hall conductivity at standard integer \npositions but the last (zero-level) plateau is missing. The zero-level anomaly is accompanied \nby metallic conductivity in the limit of low concentrations and high magnetic fields, in stark \ncontrast to the conventional, insulating behavior in this regime. The revealed chiral fermions \nhave no known analogues and present an intriguing case for quantum-mechanical studies.  \nFigure 1 provides a schematic overview of the quantum Hall effect (QHE) behavior observed in \nbilayer (2L) graphene by comparing it with the conventional integer QHE. In the standard theory, \n 2\neach filled single-degenerate Landau level (LL) contributes one conductance quantum e\n2\n\/h\ntowards the observable Hall conductivity. The conventional QHE is shown in Fig. 1a, where \nplateaus in Hall conductivity Vxy make up an uninterrupted ladder of equidistant steps. In 2L \ngraphene, QHE plateaus follow the same ladder but the plateau at zero Vxy is markedly absent (Fig. \n1b). Instead, the Hall conductivity undergoes a double-sized step across this region. In addition, \nlongitudinal conductivity Vxx in 2L graphene remains of the order of e2\/h, even at zero Vxy. The \norigin of the unconventional QHE behavior lies in the coupling between two graphene layers, \nwhich transforms massless Dirac fermions, characteristic of single-layer (1L) graphene [3-9], (Fig. \n1c) into a novel type of chiral quasiparticles. Such quasiparticles have an ordinary parabolic \nspectrum H(p)=p2\/2m with effective mass m but accumulate Berry\u2019s phase of 2S along cyclotron \ntrajectories. The latter is shown to be related to a peculiar quantization where the two lowest LLs \nlie exactly at zero energy H, leading to the missing plateau and double step shown in Fig. 1b. \nBilayer films studied in this work were made by the micromechanical cleavage of crystals of \nnatural graphite which was followed by the selection of 2L flakes by using a combination of \noptical microscopy and atomic force microscopy as described in refs. [10,11]. Multi-terminal \nfield-effect devices (inset in Fig. 2) were made from the selected flakes by using standard \nmicrofabrication techniques. As a substrate we used an oxidized heavily-doped Si wafer which \nallowed us to apply gate voltage Vg between graphene and the substrate. The studied devices \nexhibited an ambipolar electric field effect such that electrons and holes could be induced in \nconcentrations n up to 1013cm-2 (n=D\u01dcVg where D\u00a77.3\u01dc1010cm-2\/V for a 300 nm SiO2 layer). For \nfurther details about microfabrication of graphitic field-effect devices and their measurements we \nrefer to the earlier work [3,4,10,11].  \nFigure 2a shows a typical QHE behavior in 2L graphene at a fixed gate voltage (fixed n) and \nvarying magnetic field B up to 30T. Pronounced plateaus are clearly seen in Hall resistivity Uxy in \n 3\nhigh B, and they are accompanied by zero longitudinal resistivity Uxx. The observed sequence of \nthe QHE plateaus is described by Uxy=h\/4Ne2, which is the same sequence as expected for a two-\ndimensional (2D) free-fermion system with double spin and double valley degeneracy [1,2,12-15]. \nHowever, a clear difference between the conventional and reported QHE emerges in the regime of \nsmall filling factors Q<1 (see Figs. 2b,c and 3). This regime is convenient to study by fixing B and \nvarying concentrations of electrons and holes passing through the neutrality point |n||0 where Uxy\nchanges its sign and, nominally, Q=0. Also, because carrier mobilities P in graphitic films are \nweakly dependent on n [3,4,10], measurements in constant B are more informative. They \ncorrespond to a nearly constant parameter PB, which defines the quality of Landau quantization, \nand this allows simultaneous observation of several QHE plateaus during a single voltage sweep in \nmoderate magnetic fields (Fig. 2b). The periodicity 'n of quantum oscillations in Uxx as a function \nof n is defined by the density of states 0\/IgB  on each LL [1-10] (see Fig. 1). In Fig. 2c, for \nexample, 'n|1.2\u00981012cm-2 at B=12T, which yields g=4 and confirms the double spin and double \nvalley degeneracy expected from band structure calculations for 2L graphene [14,15].  \nFig. 2b shows that, although the Hall plateaus in 2L graphene follow the integer sequence \nVxy=r(4e2\/h)N for N t1, there is no sign of the zero-N plateau at Vxy=0, which is expected for 2D \nfree-fermion systems [1,2] (Fig. 1a). In this respect, the behavior resembles the QHE for massless \nDirac fermions (Fig. 1c), where also there is no plateau but a step occurs when Vxy passes the \nneutrality point. However, in 2L graphene, this step has a double height and is accompanied by a \ncentral peak in Uxx, which is twice broader than all other peaks (Fig. 2c). The broader peak yields \nthat in 2L graphene the transition between the lowest hole and electron Hall plateaus requires \ntwice the amount of carriers needed for the transition between the other QHE plateaus. This \n 4\nimplies that the lowest LL has double degeneracy 0\/42 IBu , which can be viewed as two LLs \nmerged together at n|0 (see LL charts in Fig. 1).  \nContinuous measurements through Q=0 as shown in Fig. 2b,c have been impossible for \nconventional 2D systems where the zero-level plateau in Vxy=Uxy\/(Uxy2+Uxx2) is inferred [1,2] from \na rapid (often exponential) increase in Uxx>>h\/e2 with increasing B and decreasing temperature T\nfor filling factors Q<1, indicating an insulating state. To provide a direct comparison with the \nconventional QHE measurements, Fig. 3 shows Uxx in 2L graphene as a function of B and T around \nzeroQ. 2L graphene exhibits little magnetoresistance or temperature dependence at the neutrality \npoint, in striking contrast to the conventional QHE behavior. This implies that Vxy in 2L graphene \ndoes not vanish over any interval of Q and reaches zero only at one point, where Uxy changes its \nsign. Note that Uxx surprisingly maintains a peak value |h\/ge2 in fields up to 20T and temperatures \ndown to 1K. A finite value of Uxx|h\/4e2 in the limit of low carrier concentrations and at zero B was \npreviously reported for 1L graphene [3]. This observation was in qualitative agreement with \ntheory, which attributes the finite metallic conductivity and the absence of localization to the \nrelativistic-like spectrum of 1L graphene (see refs. in [3]). 2L graphene has the usual parabolic \nspectrum, and the observation of the maximum resistivity |h\/4e2 and, moreover, its weak \ndependence on B in this system is most unexpected.  \nThe unconventional QHE in 2L graphene originates from peculiar properties of its charge \ncarriers that are chiral fermions with a finite mass, as discussed below. First, we have calculated \nthe quasiparticle spectrum in 2L graphene by using the standard nearest-neighbour approximation \n[12]. For quasiparticles near the corners of the Brillouin zone known as K-points, we find \n222\n14\n1\n12\n1)( pvp F\u000err JJH , where !\/023 avF J  , a is the lattice periodicity and J0 and J1 are \nthe intra- and inter-layer coupling constants, respectively [13]. This dispersion relation (plotted in \n 5\nFig. 2c) is in agreement with the first-principle band-structure calculations [14] and, at low \nenergies, becomes parabolic H = rp2\/2m with m=J1\/2vF2 (sign r refers to electron and hole states). \nFurther analysis [15] shows that quasiparticles in 2L graphene can be described by using the \neffective Hamiltonian  \n\u000b \f\n\u00b8\n\u00b8\n\u00b9\n\u00b7\n\u00a8\n\u00a8\n\u00a9\n\u00a7\n\u0010 \n\u000e\n0\u02c6\n\u02c60\n2\n1\u02c6\n2\n2\n2 S\nS\nm\nH     where   yx pip \u02c6\u02c6\u02c6 \u000e S .                        (1)\n2H\u02c6  acts in the space of two-component Bloch functions (further referred to as pseudospins) \ndescribing the amplitude of electron waves on weakly-coupled nearest sites A1 and B2 belonging \nto two nonequivalent carbon sublattices A and B and two graphene layers marked as 1 and 2.\nFor a given direction of quasiparticle momentum p= )sin,cos( MM pp , Hamiltonian JH\u02c6 of a \ngeneral form \n\u000b \f\n\u00b8\n\u00b8\n\u00b9\n\u00b7\n\u00a8\n\u00a8\n\u00a9\n\u00a7 \u000e\n0\u02c6\n\u02c60\nJ\nJ\nS\nS\ncan be rewritten as  \n)()(\u02c6 MVH npH J\n&& \u0098      (2)\nwhere )sin,(cos MM JJn \u0010 & and vector V&  is made from Pauli matrices [15]. For 2L graphene, \nJ=2, but notation J is useful because it also allows Eq. (2) to be linked with the case of 1L \ngraphene, where J=1. The eigenstates of JH\u02c6  correspond to pseudospins polarized parallel \n(electrons) or antiparallel (holes) to the \u2018quantization\u2019 axis n\n&\n. An adiabatic evolution of such \npseudospin states, which accompanies the rotation of momentum p\n&\n by angle M , also corresponds \nto the rotation of axis n\n&\n by angle MJ . As a result, if a quasiparticle encircles a closed contour in \nthe momentum space (that is SM 2 ), a phase shift )=JS known as Berry\u2019s phase is gained by the \nquasiparticle\u2019s wavefunction [16]. Berry\u2019s phase can be viewed as arising due to rotation of \npseudospin, when a quasiparticle repetitively moves between different carbon sublattices (A and B\nfor 1L graphene, and A1 and B2 for 2L graphene).  \n 6\nFor fermions completing cyclotron orbits, Berry\u2019s phase contributes to the semiclassical \nquantization and affects the phase of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations (SdHO).  For 1L graphene, \nthis results in a S-shift in SdHO and a related \u00bd-shift in the sequence of QHE plateaus [3-9], as \ncompared to the conventional 2D systems where Berry\u2019s phase is zero. For 2L graphene, )=2S\nand there can be no changes in the quasiclassical limit (N >>1). One might also expect that phase \n2S cannot influence the QHE sequencing. However, the exact analysis (see Supplementary \nInformation) of the LL spectra for Hamiltonian JH\u02c6  exhibiting Berry\u2019s phase JS shows that there \nis an associated J-fold degeneracy of the zero-energy Landau level (that is Berry\u2019s phase of 2S\nleads to observable consequences in the quantum limit N=0). For the free-fermion QHE systems \n(no Berry\u2019s phase), )2\/1( \u000e NcN ZH !  and the lowest state lies at finite energy 2\/cZ! , where \nmeBc \/ Z . For 1L graphene (J=1; )=S), BNevFN !2r H  and there is a single state H0 at zero \nenergy [5-9]. For 2L graphene (J=2; )=2S), )1( \u0010r NNcN ZH !  and two states H0=H1 lie at zero \nenergy [15].\nThe existence of a double-degenerate LL explains the unconventional QHE found in 2L \ngraphene. This LL lies at the border between electron and hole gases and, taking into account the \nquadruple spin and valley degeneracy, it accommodates carrier density 0\/8 IB . With reference to \nFig. 1, the existence of such LL implies that there must be a QHE step across the neutrality point, \nsimilarly to the case of 1L graphene [3-9]. Due to the double degeneracy, it takes twice the amount \nof carriers to fill it (as compared to all other LLs), so that the transition between the corresponding \nQHE plateaus must be twice wider (that is \n0\/8 IB  as compared to 0\/4 IB ). Also, the step between \nthe plateaus must be twice higher, that is 8e2\/h as compared to 4e2\/h for the other steps at higher \ncarrier densities. This is exactly the behavior observed experimentally.  \n 7\nIn conclusion, 2L graphene adds a new member to the small family of QHE systems, and its \nQHE behavior reveals the existence of massive chiral fermions with Berry\u2019s phase 2S, which are \ndistinct from other known quasiparticles. The observation of a finite metallic conductivity |e2\/h  at \nfilling factors Q|0 poses a serious challenge for theory.  \n 8\nREFERENCES \n1. Prange, R.E. & Girvin, S.M.

[1,2]) \nand the QHE in 2L graphene described in the present paper (b). Plateaus in Hall conductivity Vxy\noccur at values (ge\n2\n\/h)N where N is integer, e\n2\n\/h the conductance quantum and g the system \ndegeneracy. The distance between steps along the concentration axis is defined by the density of \nstates 0\/IgB  on each LL, which is independent of a 2D spectrum [1-9]. Here, B is magnetic field \nand 0I =h\/e the flux quantum. The corresponding sequences of Landau levels as a function of \ncarrier concentrations n are shown in blue and orange for electrons and holes, respectively. For \ncompleteness, (c) also shows the QHE behavior for massless Dirac fermions in 1L graphene.  \nFigure 2. QHE in bilayer graphene. (a) \u2013 Uxy and Uxx measured as a function of B for fixed \nconcentrations of electrons n|2.5\u00981012 cm-2 induced by the electric field effect. Inset: Scanning \nelectron micrograph of one of more than ten bilayer devices studied in our work. The width of the \nHall bar (dark central area) is |1Pm. (b, c) - Vxy  and Uxx are plotted as a function of n at a fixed B\nand temperature T=4K. Positive and negative n correspond to field-induced electrons and holes, \nrespectively. The Hall conductivity Vxy=Uxy\/(Uxy2+Uxx2) was calculated directly from experimental \ncurves for Uxy and Uxx. Vxy allows one to see more clearly the underlying sequences of QHE \nplateaus. Vxy crosses zero without any sign of the zero-level plateau that would be expected for a \nconventional 2D system. The inset shows the calculated energy spectrum for 2L graphene, which \nis parabolic at low H. Carrier mobilities P in our 2L devices were typically |3,000 cm2\/Vs, which \nis lower than for devices made from 1L graphene [3,4]. This is surprising because one generally \n 11\nexpects more damage and exposure in the case of 1L graphene that is unprotected from the \nimmediate environment from both sides.  \nFigure 3. Resistivity of 2L graphene near zero concentrations as a function of magnetic field and \ntemperature. The peak in Uxx remains of the order of h\/4e2, independent of B (a,b) and T (c,d). \nThis yields no gap in the Landau spectrum at zero energy. (b) - For a fixed n|0 and varying B, we \nobserved only small magnetoresistance. The latter varied for different devices and contact \nconfigurations (probably indicating the edge state transport) and could be non-monotonic and of \nrandom sign. However, the observed magnetoresistance never exceeded a factor of 2 in any of our \nexperiments for undoped 2L graphene.  \nFigure 1\n\u03c3xy  (     )h\nge2\n2 31\n-2 -1-3\n-3\n-2\n3\n2\nb\n\u03c3xy  (     )h\nge2\n-1\n-2 -1-3\n2 31\n-3\n-2\n3\n1\n2\ngeB\nnh\na\ngeB\nnh\n\u03c3xy  (     )h\nge2\n2 31\n-2 -1-3\n-1\n-3\n-2\n3\n1\n2\nc\ngeB\nnh\nFigure 2\n-2-4 40\nn (1012 cm-2)\n2\n2\n4\n6\n0\n\u03c1 x\nx\n(\nk\n\u2126\n)\nc\nE\np\n\u03c3\nx\ny\n(\n4\ne\n2\n\/\nh\n) 1\n2\n-1\n-2\n-4\n0\n-3\n4\nb\n3\nB=12T\nT=4K\n20T\n12T\na\n300\nB (T)\n10 20\n\u03c1 x\ny\n&\n\u03c1 x\nx\n(\nk\n\u2126\n)\nh\/4e2\n6\n0\n2\n4\nh\/8e2\nx5\nh\/12e2\n20T\n0T\n10T\nVg (V)\n-50 0 50\n3\n6\n9 \u03c1xx (k\u2126)\nB (T)\nB=10T\n3000 100 200\nT (K)\n3\n6\n9\nT=4K \n150 5 10\n3\n6\n9\nVg (V)\n-50 0 50\n0\n6\n9 \u03c1xx (k\u2126)\n3\n0\nB\nT\n100K\n4K\n50K\n\u03c1xx (k\u2126)\n\u03c1xx (k\u2126)\nFigure 3\nc\na\nd\nb\n"}
