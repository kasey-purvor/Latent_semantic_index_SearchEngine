S0036139996307334\n1. Introduction. There has been much recent interest in the consideration of\na thin film of type II superconducting material in a perpendicular applied magnetic\nfield, both from an experimental and a theoretical point of view [1, 17, 18, 19]. Type II\nsuperconductors are characterized by the appearance of quantized, vortex-like struc-\ntures of superconducting current. When a transport current is applied in the plane\nof such a film, vortices that are not pinned by impurities or other inhomogeneities in\nthe material will move, with the direction of motion being perpendicular to the cur-\nrent. This motion of vortices causes energy to be dissipated, leading to an electrical\nresistance. It is therefore very important to understand the various mechanisms of\npinning in this configuration. Here we study the effect of variations in thickness of\nthe superconducting film on vortex motion and pinning.\nOur starting point is the Ginzburg\u2013Landau theory formulated in the static case\nby Ginzburg and Landau in 1950 [7], and in a time-dependent setting by Gor\u2019kov\nand E\u00b4liashberg in 1968 [8]. The theory contains two important lengthscales, namely\n\u03bb, the penetration depth, which represents the typical lengthscale for variations in\nthe magnetic field, H, and \u03be, the coherence length, which represents the typical\nlengthscale for variations in the number density of superconducting electrons, which\nis effectively the vortex core radius.\nThe ratio of these two lengthscales is given by \u03ba = \u03bb\/\u03be, known as the Ginzburg\u2013\nLandau parameter, and is often quite large.\nHere we consider the limit in which \u03ba \u2192 \u221e. The radius of the vortex cores\nthen approaches zero when working on the \u03bb lengthscale, and the Ginzburg\u2013Landau\nequations reduce to the simpler London equation\n\u2207\u2227\u2207\u2227H +H = 2pi\u03b4(x)\u03b4(y)ez,(1.1)\nin which the delta function is due to a single vortex along the z axis containing one\nquantum of flux, andH has been scaled with the flux quantum. Note that although in\nwriting down (1.1) we have assumed that the Ohmic term \u03c3\u2202\u00b2H\/\u2202t due to the normal\n\u2217Received by the editors July 26, 1996; accepted for publication (in revised form) February 11,\n1997; published electronically August 3, 1998.

This\ndissipation will come from three main sources: (i) in the vortex cores the Ohmic term\nis not small and there are normal currents flowing with their resulting dissipation, (ii)\nthere will also be dissipation in the cores of the vortices due to the changing number\ndensity of superconducting electrons as the vortices move around, and (iii) even away\nfrom vortex cores an electric field is generated due to the changing magnetic field\n\u2202\u00b2H\/\u2202t. Since this field will not in general be perpendicular to the current curl \u00b2H,\nthere will be dissipation here also.\nIn section 2 we consider a straight vortex meeting a planar interface at an angle.\nThe case of a perpendicular vortex was first considered by Pearl [14]. In this work\nand in [11] it is shown that the current near the surface of the superconductor decays\nonly algebraically with distance, in contrast to the exponential decay in the bulk,\nwith the conclusion that vortices interact much more strongly near the surface of the\nmaterial. The magnetic field for a straight vortex at an angle to an interface has been\nconsidered by Kogan et al. [10]. Here we are interested in calculating the electric\ncurrent in this situation, since it is the current that causes a vortex to move; we aim\nto show that the vortex must meet the boundary normally.\nIn section 3 we consider a system of vortices traversing a thin film of varying\nthickness. The problem of a single vortex traversing a film of uniform thickness was\nfirst considered by Pearl [13]. More recently Kogan [9] has derived equations for a\nsystem of vortices traversing a film of uniform thickness. Here we aim to generalize\nthese models to films of varying thickness.\nIn section 4 we consider the effects on vortex motion of the variations in film\nthickness. We perform a local analysis of a single vortex and show that the vortex\nwould travel to the locally thinnest point of the film. In section 5 we consider the\neffects of increasing the lateral dimensions of the film, and derive a new thin-film\nmodel. Finally we present some conclusions.\n2. A straight vortex in a half-space. To begin our discussion of the inter-\naction of vortices with boundaries, we consider a superconducting half-space (z < 0)\ncontaining a straight vortex, along the line \u0393 given by y = 0, z = mx, as shown in\nFigure 2.1.\nThe magnetic field H then satisfies\n\u2207 \u00b7H = 0,(2.1)\n\u2207\u2227H = 0 for z > 0,(2.2)\n\u2207\u2227\u2207\u2227H +H = 2pi\u03b4\u0393 for z < 0,(2.3)\nwith\n[H] = 0 on z = 0,(2.4)\n|H| \u2192 0 as r \u2192\u221e,(2.5)\nwhere\n\u03b4\u0393 =\n\u03b4(y)\u03b4(x\u2212 z\/m)\nm\n\uf8eb\uf8ed 10\nm\n\uf8f6\uf8f8 .\nEquation (2.2) states that there is no current in the region external to the supercon-\nductor, while equation (2.3) is the London equation.

We note that (2.2) and (2.4) imply J \u00b7n = 0 on\nz = 0, where J = curl H is the electric current and n is the normal to the boundary.\nEquations (2.1) and (2.2) imply that in z > 0 we have H =\u2207\u03c6, \u22072\u03c6 = 0. Taking\nthe double Fourier transform in x and y and requiring H to decay as z \u2192\u221e gives\nH\u0302 =\n\uf8eb\uf8ed ik1ik2\n\u2212k\n\uf8f6\uf8f8\u03b1(k1, k2)e\u2212zk for z > 0,\nwhere\nH\u0302(k1, k2, z) :=\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\ne\u2212ik1x\u2212ik2yH(x, y, z)dxdy\nand\nk =\n\u221a\nk21 + k\n2\n2 .\nTransforming (2.1) and (2.3) gives\nik1H\u03021 + ik2H\u03022 + \u2202zH\u03023 = 0,(2.6)\n\u2202zz(H\u0302)\u2212 (k2 + 1)H\u0302 = \u22122pie\n\u2212ik1z\/m\nm\n\uf8eb\uf8ed 10\nm\n\uf8f6\uf8f8 for z < 0.(2.7)\nEquation (2.7) gives\nH\u0302 = Cez(k\n2+1)1\/2 +\n2pime\u2212ik1z\/m\nk21 +m\n2(k2 + 1)\n\uf8eb\uf8ed 10\nm\n\uf8f6\uf8f8 ,(2.8)\nSUPERCONDUCTING VORTICES IN THIN FILM 1811\nwhere we have discarded the complementary function corresponding to exponential\ngrowth as z \u2192 \u2212\u221e. The second term in (2.8) corresponds to the solution for a bulk\nvortex, since its inverse transform is given by\nH =\nK0\n(\u221a\n(mx\u2212 z)2\nm2 + 1\n+ y2\n)\n\u221a\nm2 + 1\n\uf8eb\uf8ed 10\nm\n\uf8f6\uf8f8 ,\nwhere K0 is a modified Bessel function of the second kind. The first term in (2.8)\ncontains the effects of the boundary. Substituting this form for H\u0302 into equation (2.6)\nwe obtain\nik1C1 + ik2C2 + (k\n2 + 1)1\/2C3 = 0,(2.9)\nwhere C = (C1, C2, C3).

Because the\nvortex lies in the plane y = 0, it is sufficient to consider the current in this plane only.\nIt can be shown that the current on y = 0 is given by J = J2ey, where ey is the unit\nvector in the y direction and\nJ2(x, 0, z) = \u2212 1\n4pi2\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nP eik1x+zQ\nk\n(\nik1m(Q\u2212 k) + kQ\u2212 k21\n)\ndk1dk2\n\u2212 (m\n2 + 1)\n4pi2m\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nik1P e\nik1(x\u2212z\/m)dk1dk2,(2.14)\n= Jsurf + Jbulk.\nHere the first term represents the current due to the surface interaction, while the\nsecond represents the bulk current due to the vortex. Indeed the bulk contribution\ncan be integrated explicitly to give\nJbulk = sign(x\u2212 z\/m)K1\n( |mx\u2212 z|\u221a\nm2 + 1\n)\n(2.15)\nas expected.\nThe motion of a straight vortex is dictated by the nonsingular part of the current.\nThe velocity of such a vortex can be derived from the Ginzburg\u2013Landau theory [3],\nand is given by\nv =\n2\n\u03b2\n(\n(J \u2212 Jbulk) |at vortex\n)\n\u2227t,(2.16)\nwhere t is the tangent vector to the vortex and \u03b2 is an order-one positive constant.\nTherefore, to consider the motion of the vortex, we need to analyze the surface inter-\naction part of the current (Jsurf) at the vortex core. We proceed by using the change\nof variables k1 = \u03c1 cosu, k2 = \u03c1 sinu on the first integral in equation (2.14), which\nbecomes\nJsurf =\u2212 2m\npi\n\u222b \u221e\n\u03c1=0\n\u222b pi\/2\nu=0\n(\n\u03c1\n\u221a\n\u03c12 + 1\u2212 \u03c12 cos2 u\n)\ne\u03c1z cos (x\u03c1 cosu)\n(m2(\u03c12 + 1) + \u03c12 cos2 u)\ndud\u03c1(2.17)\n+\n2m2\npi\n\u222b \u221e\n\u03c1=0\n\u222b pi\/2\nu=0\n\u03c1 cosu\n(\u221a\n\u03c12 + 1\u2212 \u03c1\n)\ne\u03c1z sin (x\u03c1 cosu)\n(m2(\u03c12 + 1) + \u03c12 cos2 u)\ndud\u03c1.(2.18)\nWe set z = mx and rescale x = \u00b2X to look along the vortex, near the point of\nintersection. Now the integrals can be evaluated asymptotically by splitting the \u03c1\nintegration at \u00b2\u22121\/2. The second term in (2.18) is found to be order one in \u00b2, whereas\nthe first can be integrated explicitly to leading order to give\nJsurf =\n1\n2\u00b2Xm\n\u221a\nm2 + 1\n+O(\u00b2\u22121\/2).(2.19)\nThus, using (2.16) unless m is large, the vortex will move with infinite velocity at the\ntip in the \u2212ex or the ex direction as m is positive or negative. That is, the vortex\nwill straighten to intersect normally with the boundary.\n1814 S. J. CHAPMAN AND D. R. HERON\nRemark. We comment here on the analogy with fluid vortices, which are also\nfound to intersect normally with rigid boundaries.\nIn the fluid case, the solution can be written down by introducing an equal and\nopposite image vortex, thus ensuring there is no component of the fluid velocity\nnormal to the boundary. The vortex and its image form a vortex with discontinuous\ntangent at the point of intersection, and therefore infinite curvature. Since in the\nlocal induction approximation [16], the vortex velocity is proportional to its curvature,\nsuch a vortex would formally move with infinite speed (although, of course, the local\ninduction approximation breaks down near parts of large curvature). Thus, the only\nstable configuration is that of a vortex meeting the boundary normally.\nIn the superconducting case, however, there is no simple image system, since the\nequations involve the magnetic field as well as the electric current, and must be solved\nboth inside and outside the superconductor.\nLocally near the point of intersection, however, the magnetic field decouples from\nthe current, which then satisfies\n\u2207 \u00b7 J = 0,(2.20)\n\u2207\u2227J = \u03b4\u0393 for z < 0,(2.21)\nJ \u00b7 n = 0 on z = 0,(2.22)\nwith solution\nJ = Jvortex + J image.(2.23)\nNow since the vortex and its image form a vortex with infinite curvature at the\npoint of intersection, and since the velocity of a vortex is proportional to its curvature\n[3], the vortex moves with infinite speed. Note again though that this argument is\npurely formal, since the local induction approximation breaks down if the curvature\nbecomes too large.\n3. A thin film in a perpendicular field. In this section we consider applying\na perpendicular magnetic field to a superconducting thin film of thickness order d,\nwhere \u03be \u00bf d \u00bf \u03bb. Hence the film will be thin on the lengthscale of the penetration\ndepth but not as thin as a vortex core. We note that the case d \u00bf \u03be has been\nconsidered recently in [5, 2].\nWe wish to investigate how a slow variation in the thickness will affect the motion\nof the vortex. The variations we consider are, for simplicity, assumed to be symmetric\nabout the xy plane, but the results will be similar for arbitrary variations.\nWe begin by deriving a set of equations that describe several static vortices in a\nthin film of varying thickness. We then look at the dynamics of a single vortex and\nconsider its motion due to these variations in thickness.\n3.1. A thin film of symmetrically varying thickness. Suppose the typical\nlengthscale for thickness variations in the film is \u03b4\u03bb\u00c0 \u03be and the typical width of the\nfilm is l\u03bb. We also define a\u03bb as the average separation of vortices; the size of a is\ndictated by the applied field. Thus there are six lengthscales in the problem: \u03be, d, \u03b4\u03bb,\nl\u03bb, a\u03bb, and \u03bb. We will consider the (in some sense canonical) case in which a \u223c \u03b4 \u223c l,\nso that the variations in film thickness and the separation of vortices are comparable\nto the lateral dimension of the film.\nFor the rest of this section we will consider the case l = 1, so that the film width\nis of the order of the penetration depth. Hence, in this section, we will continue\nSUPERCONDUCTING VORTICES IN THIN FILM 1815\nto nondimensionalize all lengths with the penetration depth. We will consider the\nimplications of larger film widths in section 5. We therefore define the film to be\ngiven by D = {(x, y) \u2208 \u2126 \u2286 R2, |z| < \u00b2g(x, y)}, where g is order one, \u00b2 = d\/\u03bb, and x,\ny are nondimensional.\nOur methodology involves an outer solution in which the film has zero thickness\ntogether with an inner solution within the film. We use capital letters to signify\nquantities in the film, lowercase for those external to it.\nThe equations to be satisfied are\n\u2207\u2227J +H = 2pi\n\u2211\ni\n\u03b4(x\u2212 xi)ez in D,(3.1)\nJ =\u2207\u2227H in D,(3.2)\n\u2207 \u00b7H = 0 in D,(3.3)\n\u2207\u2227h = 0 outside D,(3.4)\n\u2207 \u00b7 h = 0 outside D,(3.5)\nwith\nh = H on \u2202D,(3.6)\nJ \u00b7 n = 0 on \u2202D,(3.7)\nand\nh\u2192 hAez as |r| \u2192 \u221e,(3.8)\nwhere n is the normal to \u2202D and x = (x, y), r = (x, y, z) are the two- and three-\ndimensional position vectors.\nWe expand all quantities asymptotically in powers of \u00b2:\nh ' h(0) + \u00b2h(1) + \u00b22h(2) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,(3.9)\nhA ' h(0)A + \u00b2h(1)A + \u00b22h(2)A + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,(3.10)\nH 'H(0) + \u00b2H(1) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,(3.11)\nJ ' J (0) + \u00b2J (1) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 .(3.12)\nWe start by considering the problem inside the film.

To complete this decoupled\nproblem for the leading-order current we include the leading-order behavior of (3.7),\nnamely\nJ (0) \u00b7 \u03bd = 0 on \u2202\u2126,(3.46)\n1818 S. J. CHAPMAN AND D. R. HERON\nwhere \u03bd is the unit outward normal to \u2202\u2126.\nWe note that there are two source terms in equation (3.45) for the current. The\nfirst is the sum of \u03b4-functions due to the vortices, as expected. The second is due to\nthe applied magnetic field, which acts as a negative distributed vorticity. This term is\ndue to the Meissner effect, by which a superconductor attempts to exclude a magnetic\nfield from its interior. The current generated by this term in (3.45) is an attempt to\nshield the superconductor from the applied field, and will result in a lower magnetic\nfield inside the superconductor than the applied field h\n(0)\nA .\nIn the next section we study the problem (3.44)\u2013(3.46) for the leading-order cur-\nrent in the case of a single vortex and deduce an equation for the velocity of a vortex\nin a thin film of varying thickness.\n4. A near core analysis of a single vortex in a thin film of varying\nthickness. Here we aim to investigate the effects of varying film thickness on vortex\nmotion by looking locally near a single vortex using matched asymptotic expansions.\nThe method was first introduced by Neu [12] for complex scalar fields, and has since\nbeen employed by a variety of authors for various situations in bulk superconductors\n[3, 4, 6, 15].\nDecomposing J (0) into \u2207\u2227(Fez) +\u2207p, with F = F (x, y) and p = p(x, y), and\nconsidering a single vortex at the origin, we can rewrite equations (3.44), (3.45) as\nF = \u2212 log r + h(0)A\nr2\n4\n,(4.1)\n\u2207 \u00b7 (g\u2207p) = \u2212 (\u2207\u2227(Fez)) \u00b7\u2207g,(4.2)\nwhich implies\nJ (0) =\n(\n1\nr\n\u2212 h(0)A\nr\n2\n)\ne\u03b8 +\u2207p,(4.3)\nwhere r =\n\u221a\nx2 + y2. We note that the current due to the vortex decays only alge-\nbraically with distance, in contrast to the exponential decay for a vortex in a bulk\nmaterial, so that the interaction between vortices should be stronger in thin films, as\nnoted by [13].\nTo investigate the effects of the varying thickness on the motion of the vortex\nwe examine the solution of (4.2) as the vortex is approached. We assume that the\nmodel is quasi-static, that is, that the motion of the vortex is slow enough that the\nmagnetic field relaxes instantly. This corresponds to the relaxation time for the order\nparameter being much greater than that for the magnetic field in the time-dependent\nGinzburg\u2013Landau equations.\nWe assume, and it can be justified a posteriori, that\ng\u22072p\u00c0\u2207g \u00b7\u2207p as r \u2192 0.(4.4)\nThen\n\u22072p \u223c \u2212 e\u03b8\nrg(0, 0)\n\u00b7 (gx(0, 0), gy(0, 0)) as r \u2192 0,(4.5)\nand therefore\np \u223c 1\n2g0\n(log r (ygx0 \u2212 xgy0) + C1x+ C2y) as r \u2192 0,(4.6)\nSUPERCONDUCTING VORTICES IN THIN FILM 1819\nwhere C1, C2 are constants and g0 = g(0, 0), gx0 = gx(0, 0), gy0 = gy(0, 0).

We rescale\nx = X\/\u03ba, y = Y\/\u03ba, giving\nJ \u223c \u03ba\nR\ne\u03b8 +\nlog \u03ba\n2g0\n(\ngy0\n\u2212gx0\n)\n+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 .(4.9)\nWe hope to match this expression with a solution to the Ginzburg\u2013Landau equations\nin the core region. Fortunately, the current surrounding a curvilinear vortex as the\nvortex is approached has already been derived in [3]. Following that work, we let the\nvortex lie along a curve \u0393, given by r = q(s), and define a local coordinate system by\nr = q(s) +\nX\u02dc\n\u03ba\nn(s) +\nY\u02dc\n\u03ba\nb(s),(4.10)\nwhere s is arclength, and n(s), b(s), t(s) are the unit normal, binormal, and tan-\ngent, respectively, to the curve \u0393. The expression for the current that matches the\nGinzburg\u2013Landau solution for a curvilinear vortex is then given in [3] as\nJ \u223c e\u02dc\u03b8\nR\u02dc\n{\n\u03ba+\nKX\u02dc\n2\n}\n+\nKb\n2\n{\n\u2212 log\n(\nR\u02dc\n\u03ba\n)\n+ log 2\u2212 1\n}\n+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,(4.11)\nwhere R\u02dc and \u03b8\u02dc are local polar coordinates and K is the curvature of the vortex.\nMatching with the inner solution near the vortex core gives the local vortex velocity\nas\nv =\nK\n\u03b2\n(log \u03ba)n+O(1).(4.12)\nWe need to relate the curvilinear local coordinates X\u02dc, Y\u02dc to the Cartesian coordi-\nnates X, Y .\nAssuming that the vortex is a planar curve, we define \u03b3 as the acute angle between\nthe principal normal to \u0393 at r = q(s) and the line AO in Figure 4.1, and \u03c6 as the\nacute angle between the line AO and the ex axis. We have already seen that \u0393 must\nmeet the surfaces of the film normally, and we find that it is approximately vertical\nto leading order, so that\ncos \u03b3 \u223c 1, sin \u03b3 = O(\u00b2),(4.13)\n1820 S.

The matching with the vortex core then follows as in [3], and the velocity\nof the vortex is given by (4.12) to be\nv \u223c \u2212 log \u03ba\n\u03b2\n\u2207 (log g)|(0,0) .(4.22)\nThe velocity is therefore in the direction of the x, y components of the normal to\nthe surface. This implies that, in the absence of any external forces, a vortex will move\ntoward the locally thinnest part of the film, where it will be straight and therefore\nstationary. We show g and \u2212\u2207(log g) for the case\ng = 1 +\n1\n2\nsinx cos y,(4.23)\nin Figure 4.2.\nRemark. We see that the velocity generated due to variations in film thickness is\nO(log \u03ba). If we proceeded to the next term in v we would find, as in [3], that the ve-\nlocity generated by neighboring vortices or the applied field is O(1). Thus the motion\n1822 S. J. CHAPMAN AND D. R. HERON\nwill be dominated by (4.22) for low applied magnetic fields and for well-separated\nvortices. When that applied magnetic field becomes O(log \u03ba), or the separation of\nvortices becomes O((log \u03ba)\u22121\/2), their effect on vortex motion will be in balance with\nthe effects of varying thickness. For stronger applied magnetic fields, or for vortices\ncloser together, the effects of varying thickness will become negligible. However, since\nthe vortex separation tends to zero as \u03ba \u2192 \u221e in these last two cases, the \u201couter\u201d\nmodel on the \u03bb lengthscale will involve a homogenized vortex density, or vorticity, in\nplace of the sum of \u03b4-functions.

We recall\nthat an O(|J |) current in a film of thickness order \u00b2 produces an O(\u00b2|J |) external\nmagnetic field.

To keep these two currents in balance we will assume that the applied\nfield is O(1\/l2), so that we will also rescale\nhA =\n1\nl2\nh\u02dcA.(5.12)\nIf we rescale z\u02c6 =\n\u00b2\nl\nZ to look inside the film, equations (5.1) to (5.3) become\n\u2212 1\n\u00b22\n\u2202J\u02dc2\n\u2202Z\n+\n1\n\u00b2l\n\u2202J\u02dc3\n\u2202y\u02c6\n+ H\u02dc1 = 0,(5.13)\n1\n\u00b22\n\u2202J\u02dc1\n\u2202Z\n\u2212 1\n\u00b2l\n\u2202J\u02dc3\n\u2202x\u02c6\n+ H\u02dc2 = 0,(5.14)\n1\n\u00b2l\n(\n\u2202J\u02dc2\n\u2202x\u02c6\n\u2212 \u2202J\u02dc1\n\u2202y\u02c6\n)\n+ H\u02dc3 = 2pi\n\u2211\ni\n\u03b4(x\u02c6\u2212 x\u02c6i),(5.15)\nJ\u02dc1 = \u2212\u2202H\u02dc2\n\u2202Z\n+\n\u00b2\nl\n\u2202H\u02dc3\n\u2202y\u02c6\n,(5.16)\nJ\u02dc2 =\n\u2202H\u02dc1\n\u2202Z\n\u2212 \u00b2\nl\n\u2202H\u02dc3\n\u2202x\u02c6\n,(5.17)\nJ\u02dc3 =\n\u00b2\nl\n(\n\u2202H\u02dc2\n\u2202x\u02c6\n\u2212 \u2202H\u02dc1\n\u2202y\u02c6\n)\n,(5.18)\n\u2202H\u02dc1\n\u2202x\u02c6\n+\n\u2202H\u02dc2\n\u2202y\u02c6\n+\nl\n\u00b2\n\u2202H\u02dc3\n\u2202Z\n= 0.(5.19)\nWe see that equation (5.15) has a distinguished limit when \u039b = 1\/\u00b2l \u223c 1.

J. CHAPMAN AND D. R. HERON\nIf \u039b becomes much greater than 1, it can be seen that the first term in (5.20) becomes\ndominant, the problem for the leading-order current decouples, and we recover a\nsimilar set of equations to (3.39) to (3.42) and (3.44) to (3.46) in section 3.1 (which\nare for the specific case of l \u223c 1 or \u039b \u223c 1\/\u00b2).\nWith \u039b \u223c 1 both terms on the left-hand side of equation (5.20) remain important\nand the current and external magnetic field are coupled.\nWhen \u039b\u00bf 1 the leading-order problem becomes\nh\n(1)\n3 |z=0+ = 2pi\n\u2211\ni\n\u03b4(x\u2212 xi),(5.30)\nalong with equations (5.21) to (5.26). Thus h\n(1)\n3 |z=0+ = 0 away from vortex cores, and\nan inner analysis is necessary near each vortex in which the neglected derivatives of the\ncurrent become important. However, this final case becomes much more interesting\nwhen the separation of vortices is much less than l and we can homogenize the right-\nhand side into a vorticity, which will be the subject of another paper.\nThe law of motion (4.22), being derived from a local analysis, is still valid in the\npresent model.\n6. Conclusions. We have examined the interaction of superconducting vortices\nwith boundaries in a half-space and a thin film. We found that, as for fluid vortices,\nsuperconducting vortices must meet a boundary normally.\nWe formulated a thin-film model for isolated vortices in section 3, in which the\nequations for the current in the film and the external magnetic field decouple. We used\nthis model to examine the effect of varying film thickness on the motion of a vortex.\nWe found that vortices would move with a velocity proportional to \u2212\u2207 log g, where g\nis the function describing the film thickness. Such a law of motion is consistent with\nthe vortex moving under the curvature induced by being forced to meet the boundaries\nof the film normally, and results in the vortex moving to the locally thinnest part of\nthe film.\nFinally, we considered the effect of the film having large lateral dimension by\ncomparison with the penetration depth. We formulated a new thin-film model, in\nwhich the external magnetic field and the current in the film are again coupled.\nFor each of the films we have considered, we assumed that the separation of\nvortices, a\u03bb, and the lengthscale for the variation in film thickness, \u03b4\u03bb, were both of\nthe same order as the lateral dimensions of the film, l\u03bb, as \u00b2\u2192 0, \u03ba\u2192\u221e. This means\nthat there is a finite number of vortices in the limit. In this case, since the current\ngenerated by a vortex is order one, while the pinning force generated by a nonuniform\nfilm is order log \u03ba, the pinning forces will dominate the intervortex forces as \u03ba\u2192\u221e.\nFor more general a and \u03b4, the current in the film will be of order 1\/a2, giving an\nintervortex force of order 1\/a2, while the pinning forces will be of order (1\/\u03b4)log \u03ba.\nThus the pinning forces will be effective until the current in the film becomes of order\n(1\/\u03b4)log \u03ba. Since the current generated in the film by an applied field of magnitude\nhA is of order lhA, this corresponds to an applied field of order 1\/(l\u03b4)log \u03ba.\nLet us now translate this back into dimensional variables. Let l\u02dc = l\u03bb be the\ndimensional width of the film, and \u03b4\u02dc = \u03b4\u03bb be the dimensional lengthscale for variations\nin film thickness. As a dimensional reference for the magnetic field we can either\nchoose the flux quantum \u03a60, which is one in these units, the thermodynamic critical\nmagnetic field Hc, which is \u03ba\/\n\u221a\n2 in these units, or the upper critical field Hc2 , which\nSUPERCONDUCTING VORTICES IN THIN FILM 1825\nis \u03ba2 in these units. The pinning force is then effective up to a magnetic field of order\n\u03bb2\nl\u02dc\u03b4\u02dc\nlog \u03ba\u03a60 =\n\u03bb2\nl\u02dc\u03b4\u02dc\nlog \u03ba\n\u221a\n2\nHc\n\u03ba\n=\n\u03bb2\nl\u02dc\u03b4\u02dc\nlog \u03ba\nHc2\n\u03ba2\n.\nREFERENCES\n[1] E.
