Olson is old-fashioned but informative about the equipment resources and composing philosophies of pioneer electronic music composers Milton Babbitt (Philomel; Ensembles for Synthesiser) and Lejaren A. Hiller (co-composer with John Cage of HPSCHD). The tape improvisations of Otto Luening and Vladimir Ussachevsky establish a recognizable aesthetic for Louis and Bebe Barron\u2019s bold and inventive music for the movie Forbidden Planet. The mysterious impact of vocoder-modulated sounds and noises, popularized in children\u2019s radio items and including such masterly singles as Jack Benny plays \u2018The Bee\u2019 on Capitol in the 1950s, would eventually inspire Xavier Rodet to create his Chant software at IRCAM that made Jonathan Harvey\u2019s Mortuos Plango possible in 1985, and Speakings conceivable in 2008. The practical joke implied by Berio\u2019s Diff\u00e9rences in 1958, in which the sounds of live performers are gradually invaded and electronically distorted via unseen stereo speakers, gains added piquancy in the context of contemporary public demonstrations in New York in which passers-by were invited to spot the difference between anechoic tapes reproduced by a stereo pair of Edgar Villchur\u2019s groundbreaking Acoustic Research AR-2 air suspension loudspeakers, and the actual sounds of the Fine Arts Quartet and other famous ensembles playing live.

Mobility of meaning is particularly characteristic of Shostakovich\u2019s output, which offers, according to Taruskin, \u2018a tabula rasa on which all and sundry could inscribe their various messages with a minimum of resistance\u2019 (Ibid.). For many decades, such inscriptions have of course been dominated by those that read the music in the light of its relationship with the Soviet state: Eric Levi, in his contribution to The Cambridge Companion to Shostakovich, describes the composer as a \u2018political football\u2019 (p. 287) as commentators motivated by ideological concerns sought to praise or condemn the influence that politics had on the music. Others have taken the opposite approach, which, broadly speaking, looks at the ways in which Shostakovich encodes his own political resistance within the music. In either case, the music is at risk of becoming a cipher. It is against this background that the editors of The Cambridge Companion seek to position their volume: the publisher\u2019s blurb on the back claims that the book offers a new starting point and a guide for readers who seek a fuller understanding of Shostakovich\u2019s place in the history of music. Bringing together an international team of scholars, the book brings up-to-date research to bear on the full range of Shostakovich\u2019s musical output. The strategies involved in developing \u2018a fuller understanding\u2019 and covering \u2018the full range\u2019 of the composer\u2019s compositions are similar: contributions discuss most (though by no means not all) of the composer\u2019s output, arranged by genre and including hitherto unfashionable areas such as Shostakovich\u2019s political music and his scores for film, and many authors contextualise this work with reference to external events. This approach certainly brings breadth to the study; it inevitably leads to an unevenness of depth, however. This is in part a consequence of the availability of resources to date. The second section of the book, for example, discusses Shostakovich\u2019s music for stage and screen. Here, the relative unfamiliarity of much of the repertoire has led contributors to discuss scenarios and plots, Shostakovich\u2019s methods of artistic collaboration, and the political background against which this work took place. The importance of this area of Shostakovich\u2019s output resonates throughout the volume \u2013 Gerard McBurney, for instance, discusses how the theatre provided a \u2018laboratory\u2019 in which Shostakovich could experiment; hints of this can be found in Shostakovich\u2019s early symphonies (Roseberry, 15). Crucial too, is the way in which the composer developed a \u2018cool-headed grasp of the way the same music could bear different meanings in different contexts\u2019 (McBurney, 147). This observation underlines the semantic fluidity to be found in the composer\u2019s work, and guards against the tendency noted by Francis Maes \u2018to approach the songs mainly with a desire for unequivocal answers to vexing questions of meaning in Shostakovich\u2019s music\u2019 (231). Yet it is telling, too, that the chapters on dramatic music contain no musical examples, and in some cases only passing reference to the music at all. By way of contrast, the editors single out (p. 2) those contributions that are more analytical in focus, which are all grouped together in the first section of the book, \u2018Instrumental works\u2019. Three of these five explore a single genre: Eric Roseberry tackles the symphonies, Judith Kuhn the string quartets and Malcolm MacDonald the string concertos and sonatas. David Fanning adopts a more historical approach in his exploration of the early music leading up to the First Symphony, whereas David Haas concentrates on a single work (the Second Piano Sonata). The contributions don\u2019t quite succeed in covering \u2018the full range\u2019 of Shostakovich\u2019s instrumental outputs \u2013 the piano music is only patchily covered, for example, though certain works are mentioned again in later chapters \u2013 and the shifting of focus from large groups of works (the symphonies and string quartets) to single works (the Second Sonata) leads to an unevenness in the amount of detail that can be provided. Rounding off the volume are two chapters on the songs (Francis Maes) and political works (Pauline Fairclough) \u2013 the latter venturing into previously uncharted territory in Western Shostakovich scholarship \u2013 followed by a range of essays that provide alternative viewpoints on the composer. The first of these, by Erik Levi, was discussed above. David Haas provides an interesting survey not only of Shostakovich\u2019s harmonic language, but also the ways in which Soviet and Western theorists alike have tried to explain it. David Fanning studies Shostakovich\u2019s recorded performances of his work, and the final chapter offers an interpretation of \u2018Jewish existential irony\u2019 in the music (Esti Sheinberg).","cites":null},{"id":16647235,"title":"Vivos Voco: A Realization at IRCAM\u2019.

Among them, an email from Max Mathews in which \u2013 at last \u2013 the old veteran finally disavows Fourier and his legacy, but adds the bitter rider For musical purposes, in the class ANY SOUND, almost all timbres are uninteresting, and many timbres feeble or ugly. \u2026 It is VERY HARD to create new timbres we hear as interesting, powerful and beautiful. \u2026 New music is now limited by the limits of our understanding of the perception of music by the human ear and brain.15 All that in just 60 years. And from Stockhausen, a brief note appealing to new generations to work hard in developing timbres, dynamics, and space movements in electronic music.\u2018These three parameters are still in their childhood\u2019. That says it all. And adding, this time more in hope than anger, Electronic Art Music will develop very much, after the consequences of the few [sic] compositions of the last fifty-three years are seriously studied and have become common knowledge.16 Robin Maconie Cornelius Cardew (1936\u20131981): a life unfinished by John Tilbury.

Cambridge University Press, \n\u00a348.00 (hardback), \u00a317.99 (paperback).\nAmong the more historically interesting musi-\ncal events of  2008 were the recovery of  the earli-\nest surviving recorded item of  British computer \nmusic; the resynthesis in California of  one of  the \nearliest known voice recordings from a phonauto-\ngraph wave trace originally made by the Belgian \nL\u00e9on Scott in 1860; and the Scottish premi\u00e8re of  \nJonathan Harvey\u2019s Speakings, a BBC Prom com-\nmission for 11 electronically voice-modulated \nsolo instruments and orchestra. The most poign-\nant perhaps is the Scott recording. From a high-\nresolution scan of  a copy of  the original waveform \nof  a few seconds\u2019 duration, scratched in white \nby a trembling hog bristle on black wax-coated \npaper, scientists at Lawrence Berkeley National \nLaboratory have been able to recover the voice \nof  a young female, presumed to be the inventor\u2019s \ndaughter, singing a fragment of  the second verse \nof  \u2018Au clair de la lune\u2019 in a clear, unforced voice:\nAu clair de la lune\nPierrot r\u00e9pondit \u2026\nThe sample is posted online for anyone to hear.1 \nApart from pleasure at hearing the natural \nbeauty of  so young a voice perfectly reproduced \nfrom a century and a half  ago \u2013 very different in \ncharacter from the politically conscious mes-\nsage to future generations recorded by Florence \nNightingale on an Edison cylinder in 1890 \u2013 what \nis most astonishing is the quality of  the sound, a \ntribute to the recovery technology, to the excel-\nlent acoustic design of  Scott\u2019s second generation \nlaboratory phonautograph, and not forgetting \nthe contribution of  Rudolf  Koenig, Scott\u2019s scien-\ntific equipment consultant and manufacturer. \u2018We \nhad a tuning fork side by side with the recording\u2019, \nremarked Earl Cornell, a scientist involved in the \nrecovery of  the voice signal, following its pres-\nentation at an Audio Science event at Stanford \nUniversity on 28 March 2008. Because the Scott \nrecorder was manually rotated, making the trace \nrecording potentially unstable, it was Koenig\u2019s \nbright idea to record the waveform of  a tuning \nfork along with the subject voice in an early form \nof  SMPTE timecoding. By adjusting the wave-\nform transfer so that the tuning fork trace was \nperfectly regular, it was possible to eliminate any \ndistortion from the reproduced voice recording. \nIn retrospect, the choice of  lyric comes across as \na mysterious premonition of  Debussy\u2019s atmos-\npheric Claire de Lune for piano, even hinting at the \ndark otherworld of  Schoenberg\u2019s Pierrot Lunaire, \na setting of  poems by another Belgian, symbolist \npoet Albert Giraud, and deliberately staged in the \noracular style of  a cylinder recorded s\u00e9ance.\nPerformed by a University of  Manchester \nSmall-Scale Experimental Machine (a Ferranti \nMark I) to a software program designed by \nChristopher Strachey, a friend of  Alan Turing, \nand recovered from an archive acetate disc of  a \nprogramme originally recorded in the autumn \nof  1951 for the BBC Children\u2019s Hour, the synthe-\nsized melody of  God save the King is of  interest as \na symbolic act linking the development of  com-\nputing and codebreaking devices in the Bletchley \nera during and after the second world war, with \nmusical emblems of  nationhood and a new age of  \ninformation theory.2 The association of  computer \nand electronic music with Cold War intelligence \ninitiatives, including speech recognition and \ninterception, is a major reason why institutional \nelectronic music developed in the piecemeal way \nit did, why it continued to be funded covertly by \nthe military when progress was slow and musical \nresults inconclusive, and why it has been so diffi-\ncult to extract any coherent history of  the period, \ndelivered in sensible English, from surviving veter-\nans of  those early days. I have previously discussed \nthe interconnectedness of  electronic music, \nspeech science, and cognition theory in relation \nto Stockhausen\u2019s Gesang der J\u00fcnglinge, and more \nparticularly Hymnen, in my book Other Planets \nand elsewhere online.3 The discovery of  a British \nnational anthem among the first computer-gen-\nerated melodies, 15 years in advance of  Hymnen \nand Max Mathews\u2019s FORTRAN encoded interpo-\nlation of  The British Grenadiers into When Johnny \ncomes marching home, is just another inadvertent \n 1  http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/technology\/7318180.stm (3 April \n2009).\n 2  Jonathan Fildes, \u2018\u201cOldest\u201d computer music unveiled\u2019. http:\/\/\nnews.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/technology\/7458489.stm (3 April 2009).\n 3  Robin Maconie, Other Planets.

I have no moral objection to this partner-\nship, which has a long and authentic history. I only \nwish it had led to a greater number of  musically \ninteresting results.\nPotentially the most exciting development \nin British electronic music of  2008 \u2013 and pos-\nsibly ever \u2013 was the premi\u00e8re on 18 August 2008 \nof  Jonathan Harvey\u2019s BBC Prom commission \nSpeakings for electronically modified solo instru-\nments and orchestra. Although he now affects the \nenigmatic demeanour of  a Yoda of  sci-fi mythol-\nogy, Harvey\u2019s long association with IRCAM, and \nhis willingness (or so it seems) to lend his consid-\nerable compositional gifts in the service of  the \nintelligence agenda that has guided Boulez and \nhis team of  software designers into new and inter-\nesting areas, make him worthy of  more serious \nand protracted attention from a British electronic \nculture indelibly branded with the theme of  Dr \nWho. To those in the know, the idea of  imprinting \nthe shapes and resonances of  human speech on \na live orchestra is open to be read as a Boulezian \nrejoinder, some 40 years in the making, to the fab-\nulous cacophony of  electronics and orchestra of  \nStockhausen\u2019s Mixtur. I have not heard the work. \nBut the idea itself  is exciting enough, and wheth-\ner Speakings proves to be a finished attempt or \nmerely a work in progress, the objectives of  such \na musical initiative are evidently of  mainstream \nsignificance.\nEvents from 2008 cannot be expected to figure \nin a survey of  electronic music published in 2007. \nHowever what a reader does have a right to expect \nfrom such a survey \u2013 particularly one compiled for \nuse as an undergraduate textbook and published \nover the imprint of  a major university publishing \nhouse \u2013 is an overview of  sufficient completeness \nto allow a reader to place such newsworthy events \nin context and appreciate their significance, intel-\nlectual as well as musical. Electronic music may be \nregarded superficially as a minority interest, just \none topic in a series dedicated to selected reper-\ntoires, composers, and genres. The difference is \nthat whereas a basic understanding of  western \nmusic is sufficient to come to terms with the spe-\ncifics of  most individual subject areas in such a list, \nin order for a reader to be safely inducted into the \nart and history of  electronic music, a grounding in \na range of  disciplines is normally required, includ-\ning the acoustics of  musical instruments and envi-\nronments, the physiology of  speech, the design of  \nelectrical circuits, the implications of  information \ntheory, equal temperament, hi-fi and surround \nsound, and the philosophy of  language. \nOne would also like to think that the present \npublication might acknowledge Penny Souster, \nformer partner of  Tim Souster and recently retired \nmusic books editor of  Cambridge University \nPress. As an aspiring composer of  electronic \nmusic and cofounder, along with Roger Smalley \nand Peter Britton, of  the Stockhausen-inspired \nlive electronics trio Intermodulation in the 1970s, \nTim deserves at least a mention on the British por-\ntion of  the honour roll, given that coeditor Nick \nCollins is himself  a live electronics specialist. One \nlooks in vain however for any mention of  Tim, or \nRoger, or Peter. Or the group Intermodulation. \nOr even intermodulation as a process in electronic \nmusic. Indeed, having read the book and taken \nnote of  the uneven, Facebook qualities of  con-\ntributor selection, writing, proofing, bibliogra-\nphy and indexing, it is hard to imagine the present \nvolume as in any way a tribute to the professional \nand musical standards of  Penny Souster\u2019s edito-\nrial legacy. The incoherence is in fact so striking, \nand the level of  ignorance so marked in so many \ndepartments \u2013 literary, musical, and technical \u2013 as \nto incline an informed reader to view the book \nin its present state as the dismembered object of  \nsome kind of  predatory struggle between the gen-\nerations, from which the generation X representa-\ntives of  an already out of  date laptop aesthetic \nhave emerged as temporary victors.\nI am bound to feel a certain sympathy for the \nEMAS group of  1979 (now Sonic Arts) to which \nI once briefly contributed as club secretary and \nnewsletter editor. That buoyant collective includ-\ned Barry Anderson, inventor of  the world\u2019s longest \ntape loop and provider of  tape music for Harrison \nBirtwistle\u2019s Mask of  Orpheus; Hugh Davies, inde-\nfatigable chronicler of  electronic music and \ninventor of  the shozyg, a portable sound effects \nmachine; Simon Emmerson at City and Peter \nManning at Durham, both of  whom have pub-\nlished useful books on electronic and computer \nmusic; Richard Orton at York, who found amaz-\ning (and musically significant) things to do with \nindustrial vibrators, even though nothing came of  \nit; Michael Greenhough at Cardiff, who developed \nintelligent music software some years ahead of  \nDavid Cope; Dave Malham, ambisonics systems \nexpert, also at York; and Lawrence Casserley at \nRCM. When I last looked, most of  these people \nwere still around. They are not mentioned in the \nbook. I regret that. British IRCAM composers are \nhardly to be seen.

Objections to the term electronic music voiced \nseparately but to identical purpose by Andrew \nHugill, Denis Smalley in reflective mode, and \nNatasha Barrett, lead one to suspect that the com-\npilers may originally have planned to title the book \nThe Cambridge Companion to Acousmatic Music. Of  \ncourse that would never do: the US market does \nnot recognize the word. A confection devised by \nthe GRM musique concr\u00e8te leadership in Paris (in \nan attempt, I suspect, to deodorize what Boulez \nonce famously described as \u2018a flea-market of  pur-\nloined sounds with nothing of  value to be found \nin any of  them\u2019), acousmatic grandly alludes to the \nakousmatikoi of  the School of  Pythagoras, those \nwho were screened from observing the interval \nmanipulations of  the monochord by the math-\nematikoi. \u2018The whole point of  acousmatic music\u2019, \nsays Denis innocently, \u2018is that there is nothing to \nwatch\u2019. He doesn\u2019t get it. The underlying message \nof  the akousmatikoi is that, seeing nothing, they \nunderstood nothing of  what was going on behind \nthe curtain.\nTo put it as succinctly as possible, the origins of  \nmusic in all senses, including electronic, lie in the \ndescription and codification of  ritualized speech, \nand thus incorporate a philosophy of  meaning as \nexpressed in accent, rhythm, and intonation (mel-\nody). The development, unique to the west, of  the \nconcept of  a navigable pitch space, representing a \nuniform continuum in quantifiable steps in har-\nmonious relation, articulated on a digital keyboard \nin digital notation, has enabled the invention in \nsubsequent centuries of  chiming clocks, the met-\nronome, musical boxes and other programmed \nautomata, in support of  the Cartesian notion of  \nmechanical music and speech, and thereafter robot-\nics, developments in which Mozart, Beethoven, \nand Haydn were equally involved.4 Stockhausen\u2019s \nmusical boxes in Tierkreis allude directly to the era \nof  Mozart, the dramatic sounds of  a weaving shut-\ntle in Trans yet another reference to past technol-\nogy, in this case the Jacquard weaving loom of  the \nNapoleonic era, programmed by punched cards \nadapted from those of  the fairground calliope. \nMary Shelley\u2019s fantasy of  Frankenstein is a modish \n19th-century literary response to the Cartesian \nvision of  programmable life forms embodied in \nthe barrel organ, Maelzel\u2019s orchestrion, and von \nKempelen\u2019s mechanical speech synthesizer, tech-\nnology revisited in the 20th century by Conlon \nNancarrow and revived to ghoulish effect in CD \nrecordings from the 1980s of  Gershwin\u2019s Rhapsody \nin Blue starring a Duo-Art paper roll recording of  \nthe long-dead composer as soloist. The oppressive-\nly dulcet tones of  Thaddeus Cahill\u2019s electrically \npowered Dynamophone correspond to an updat-\ned online version of  Benjamin Franklin\u2019s glass \narmonica, whose unearthly timbre adds a sense of  \nparanoia to the Mad Scene from Donizetti\u2019s Lucia \ndi Lammermoor, is imitated by the spooky celesta in \nthe second of  Schoenberg\u2019s Five Orchestral Pieces \nof  1909, and continues to inspire anxiety in the \ntheremin wails of  sci-fi film music in the 1950s.5 \nWhile Boulez\u2019s timbral experiments in Anth\u00e8mes \n(1997) and elsewhere rightly defer to Jean-Claude \nRisset\u2019s contribution to FM synthesis and Andrew \nGerzso\u2019s virtuosity in systems design and applica-\ntions, they also attach to a much older tradition \nof  organ emulation of  instrumental and voice \ntimbres, exposed in the deliberately defective mix-\ntures of  Messiaen\u2019s Messe de la Pentec\u00f4te and Livre \nd\u2019Orgue, at the same time reaching back in history \nto early medieval times and beyond. The list goes \non and on. There is no cutoff  point. \nOmitting to mention the electronic organ, \nor the acoustic organ, as though to suggest that \npresent-day hard drives and portable software \nhave nothing to do with history, would be bad \nenough from a scholarly perspective. The pity \nof  it, however, is that in neglecting the contribu-\ntion of  electrical engineering to electronic music \nthe editors of  this Eurocentric pot-pourri have \ncontrived to allow not only a seriously quantifi-\nable American contribution, but also a fascinat-\ning recent history of  British audio design, to sink \nwithout trace.

This \nwas the breakthrough from which Britain perfect-\ned essential aerial radar defence technology for \nthe war of  1939\u201345, much of  the documentation \nof  which remains classified. \nSince the success of  any digital copy of  a wave-\nform characteristic of  a sounding body relies, after \nconversion to digital at a sufficiently high bit rate, \non the fidelity of  the best analogue equipment \n(microphone, amplifier, recording medium), the \nknowledge base of  computer music is necessarily \ngrounded in electrical engineering (equipment \ndesign) and balance engineering (the best equip-\nment allied to music of  the highest quality per-\nforming in an optimum acoustic). For that reason \na history of  electronic music in Britain is incom-\nplete that ignores the contributions of  scientists \nand engineers such as Blumlein, Paul Voigt (inven-\ntor of  the slack diaphragm microphone), Arthur \nHaddy of  Decca (developer of  ffrr extended range \nrecording and the Decca \u2018tree\u2019), and more recent \ngeniuses Peter Walker of  Quad electrostatics, Ray \nDolby (who as founder of  Dolby Laboratories in \nLondon in 1965 deserves the status of  honorary \nEnglishman), Peter Fellgett and Michael Gerzon, \ndevelopers of  surround-sound ambisonics from \nprinciples established by Alan Blumlein, and not \nleast Ben and Jonathan Finn, authors of  the music \ncomposing and printing software that has enabled \nmusicians of  all ages to come face to face both \nwith the design possibilities, and the distinctive \nlimitations, of  computer synthesized instrumen-\ntal sound. For an educational title on electronic \nmusic to ignore educational music software is \nfrankly incomprehensible.\nTraditional tone synthesis, as adopted by elec-\ntrical engineers and religiously digitized by soft-\nware designers thereafter, is grounded in the \nformulae articulated by Fourier and Laplace in \nthe 18th century, which declare that the evolution \nof  a dynamic system (such as a waveform, a mel-\nody, or the weather) can be adequately predicted \nfrom sufficient information of  an initial state, \nalong with the proposition that the \u2018initial state\u2019 \nrepresented for example by an acoustic waveform \ncan be exactly expressed as the sum of  a set of  \nsine waves corresponding to partial frequencies \nof  the same fundamental at appropriate ampli-\ntudes. This is the mantra. Says Alan Douglas, \u2018The \nwork of  Helmholtz and Fourier has proved that \nany wave form, no matter how complex, may be \nresolved into its individual frequency components \nby mathematical means. Not only their frequen-\ncies but their amplitudes can be calculated\u2019.7 What \nthe statement actually means is that a curve rep-\nresented instantaneously as a line trace on a two-\ndimensional surface can be represented exactly in \nmathematical terms as the sum of  a finite number \nof  simple oscillations. What it has incorrectly \nbeen assumed to imply is that the continuous \nprocess from which such a sample is taken can be \nextrapolated at will from the evidence of  the sam-\nple, reading both forward and backward in time. \nThat is arguably true, but only for stable tones of  \ninfinite duration. A widespread perception among \nscientists that western music consists exclusively \nof  stable tones, and is notated as a succession of  \nsteady states, has been interpreted to justify imag-\ninative fictions of  computer music intelligence in \nrecent history (Lejaren Hiller, Allen Forte, et al.), \nthat the 12-tone equal tempered chromatic scale \ncorresponds to a law of  nature, and that classical \nmusic aspires to the disembodied perfection of  a \nmusical box.\nA sample waveform corresponding to a micro-\nphone signal, representing a point location in \na three-dimensional sound field, assumes that \nthe phase and amplitude information obtained \nat a single location in time and space is sufficient \nto determine the totality of  information from a \nsource instrument at every point within an asso-\nciated sound field. This is like taking an arbitrary \n\u2018V\u2019 cross-section of  a microgroove recording and \nclaiming to deduce an entire composition from it, \nor (in the Markovian world of  predictive linguis-\ntics inhabited by Max Mathews and Stockhausen\u2019s \ninformation theory mentor Werner Meyer-\nEppler) claiming to deduce an entire conversation \nfrom the tone of  voice of  a single syllable. How \nto predict and control the evolution of  natural \nsounds, and speech, and thought processes, from \nlimited samples, has been the overriding chal-\nlenge of  electronic music and associated infor-\nmation and cognitive research initiatives from \ntheir beginnings in the 1950s. The butterfly effect \nof  chaos theory is only one of  many fatal conse-\nquences of  extrapolating from incomplete data. \nThe alien metallic quality of  so much electronic \nmusic, whether voltage-controlled in origin, as \nin Stockhausen\u2019s Sirius, or software generated, as \n 6  Sir William H.

The fatal con-\nsequence of  the orthodox approach to creating an \nelectronic musical instrument is that tone signals \ngenerated as finished waveforms are invariably \nmono, and usually anechoic, existing in an acous-\ntic void. The challenge of  replicating the natural \nunpredictability (or phasiness) of  sound in space \nwas recognized by Lowrey, Compton, and other \nelectronic organ manufacturers, who dealt with \nit by incorporating rotating speakers, or rotating \npaddles in front of  speakers, Meyer-Eppler howev-\ner recommending adding a subaudio tone to the \nmix, interestingly named an \u2018aleatoric\u2019, to avoid a \nmerely mechanical tremulant effect.8 \nTo predict or compute the evolution and move-\nment of  synthesized tones in a coherent virtual \nacoustic from a standing start is virtually impos-\nsible. The alternative is to synthesize musical \nsounds in a manner more closely resembling the \nbehaviour of  a real acoustic instrument. With \nthe arrival of  faster programming and vocal tract \nmodelling in the 1980s it became possible to con-\nsider an approach to synthetic sound generation \nin a coincident multi-channel format compatible \nwith ambisonics signal processing.9 The option \nremains viable, and has stalled only because \nof  inertia within the industry. What such an \napproach implies is understanding that the har-\nmonic complexity and spatial orientation of  the \nsound of  a natural musical instrument arise from \nthe resistance of  a perforated resonator of  a par-\nticular shape to the introduction of  excess energy \nfrom a performer. That energy may be inchoate, \nin the form of  continuous air pressure, or tuned, \nas in the case of  a bowed or plucked string. In \neither case the purity and variability of  the result-\ning tone is a consequence of  cooperative feedback \nbetween random energy and physical resistance, \nthe first being expressively variable and the com-\nbination implying temporary storage and man-\naged dissipation of  a continuously varying energy \ninput. This is not rocket science. It is learning to \nhold the bow correctly.\nOf  most of  the contributors to the present \nvolume, the less said the better. Exhortations like \n\u2018Electronic music is joyfully accessible to anyone \nwith a computer of  even limited power\u2019 make me \nwant to gag. They are like saying brain surgery \nis available to anyone with a screwdriver. \u2018There \nshould never be a minority category of  \u201ccreative \nartist\u201d from which most people are excluded\u2019 \ndeclares Laurie Spiegel. Look around. References \nto Francis Bacon\u2019s fabulous Sound-Houses are an \nembarrassment, even though Daphne Oram men-\ntioned it first and is a better candidate for technical \napprobation than Percy Grainger and his vaunted \nKangaroo Pouch machine (a Freudian concep-\ntion if  ever I saw one). Margaret Schedel does not \nseem to appreciate the difference between Scott\u2019s \nphonautograph and the mechanical model of  the \nhuman ear of  the same name created by Alexander \nGraham Bell. Pierre Schaeffer\u2019s concept of  the \n\u2018sound object\u2019, based on gestalt theory, is at least \nintelligent and deserves better than airy dismissal \nas the precursor of  modern sampling technology. \nSchaeffer, incidentally, was not the first composer \nto create music with prerecorded media, as often \nalleged. That honour belongs to Russell Hunting, \ndeviser of  the immensely popular Boer War fund-\nraising 78 rpm disc The Departure of  the Troopship, \ndescribed by co-producer Fred Gaisberg in 1904 \nas \u2018a star turn \u2026 with crowds at the quayside, \nbands playing the troops up the gangplank, bugles \nsounding \u201cAll ashore,\u201d farewell cries of  \u201cDon\u2019t \nforget to write,\u201d troops singing \u201cHome, Sweet \nHome,\u201d which gradually receded in the distance, \nand the far-away mournful hoot of  the steamer \nwhistle. \u2026 It brought tears to the eyes of  thou-\nsands.\u201910 Typical of  the dumb Orwellian mentality \nthroughout is Sergi Jord\u00e0\u2019s line \u2018an ambitious goal \nfor any new instrument is the potential to create \na new kind of  music\u2019, a statement that would be \nillogical and ungrammatical if  it were not already \ncompletely and utterly meaningless.\n 8  Werner Meyer-Eppler, \u2018Statistical and Psychological Problems \nof  Sound\u2019 tr.

For the more technically minded and com-\nputer literate, the going is a little more tough, but \nthe material is out there.

The tape improvisations of  \nOtto Luening and Vladimir Ussachevsky estab-\nlish a recognizable aesthetic for Louis and Bebe \nBarron\u2019s bold and inventive music for the movie \nForbidden Planet. The mysterious impact of  voco-\nder-modulated sounds and noises, popularized in \nchildren\u2019s radio items and including such masterly \nsingles as Jack Benny plays \u2018The Bee\u2019 on Capitol in \nthe 1950s, would eventually inspire Xavier Rodet \nto create his Chant software at IRCAM that made \nJonathan Harvey\u2019s Mortuos Plango possible in \n1985, and Speakings conceivable in 2008. The prac-\ntical joke implied by Berio\u2019s Diff\u00e9rences in 1958, in \nwhich the sounds of  live performers are gradually \ninvaded and electronically distorted via unseen \nstereo speakers, gains added piquancy in the \ncontext of  contemporary public demonstrations \nin New York in which passers-by were invited to \nspot the difference between anechoic tapes repro-\nduced by a stereo pair of  Edgar Villchur\u2019s ground-\nbreaking Acoustic Research AR-2 air suspension \nloudspeakers, and the actual sounds of  the Fine \nArts Quartet and other famous ensembles play-\ning live. There is a constant interplay in the history \nof  audio between what composers of  classic elec-\ntronic music are doing, and what is going on in the \nindustry.\nAfter the successful launch of  IRCAM, insepa-\nrably linked to the 1984 premi\u00e8re of  Boulez\u2019s \nR\u00e9pons, the first real breakthrough of  the dig-\nital synthesis age, a number of  titles appeared \nfrom MIT Press under the editorship of  Curtis \nRoads, bringing together collections of  technical \nessays by contributors representing joint US and \nEuropean research initiatives that made IRCAM \npossible.11 To a majority of  readers this material \nwill remain hard to figure out, and even appear out \nof  date, but it cannot be ignored. The most strik-\ning feature of  these contributions as a whole is \ntheir retrospective nature. They read as testimoni-\nals of  faith, are carefully written, and scrupulously \nedited, conveying an unmistakeable emotion of  \nthe end of  an era, and the final reluctant abandon-\nment of  a particular line of  inquiry and associated \nphilosophy. It is a little touching to revisit James \nMoorer, co-developer of  IRCAM\u2019s 4C, on the \ntribulations of  a reverberation program, only to \nrealize that one of  the problems arising from an \noversimplified approach to artificial reverbera-\ntion is the generation of  unwanted metallic eigen-\ntones.12 Elsewhere a slight two-page contribution \non the relatively simple technical transformations \nof  Jonathan Harvey\u2019s Mortuos Plango turns out to \nhave been ghosted by Stanley Haynes.13 Among \nthe more telling vignettes are conversations in \nwhich veterans of  the early days \u2013 Risset, Marvin \nMinsky, Rodet \u2013 reflect on what they hoped to \nachieve and in some cases are still hoping may \nbe achieved.

Copula, \u00a345.00 (hardback), \u00a330.00 (paperback).\nI can\u2019t recall a book for which I\u2019ve waited with \ngreater anticipation \u2013 or for longer \u2013 than John \nTilbury\u2019s biography of  Cornelius Cardew. The \nauthor has had some advantages over the 25 years \nsince he began work, quite soon after Cardew\u2019s \ndeath in 1981. One is that, having suffered the loss \nof  its original publisher, the volume was taken on \nby Copula, Eddie Prevost\u2019s own company. Prevost \nhas allowed Tilbury over 1,000 pages, even before \nwe reach the usual referencing, etc: something \nthat no conventional commercial publisher would \nhave ever permitted.\nThat kind of  luxury is also a little problem-\natic, since it brings with it the implication that an \nauthor has somehow had room for \u2018everything \nthat is the case\u2019. This expectation is, of  course, \nultimately a false one: what would \u2018everything\u2019 \nbe? But it will nevertheless hang particularly over \nany reader who has been in any way involved with \nCardew, every time he or she spots something \nmissing (a little list is available on request). \nTilbury has had access to an impressive body of  \nsource materials, too, including Cardew\u2019s journals \nand correspondence. These turn out to be exten-\nsive; and even if  they don\u2019t cover all periods of  \nhis most active quarter-century or so, they prove \nrevealing, both on the composer\u2019s thinking and \nreading (which were unusually probing as well \nas wide-ranging), and on his music itself. Tilbury \nquotes liberally from the journals and much other \nunpublished material, sometimes to fascinating \neffect. It\u2019s clearer from this book than ever before \nthat Cardew was brilliant, endlessly fascinating to \nthose around him. He was also even more than \nthe usual mass of  contradictions that most of  us \nare. Growing up a child of  bohemian parents, he \nwent to a reputable cathedral choir and public \nschool (Canterbury); composing, in his last years, \nsongs for Communist rallies, he had until then led \na life in essence so resolutely middle-class, despite \nconstant impoverishment, that, rather remark-\nably, popular music of  almost any kind had played \nno part in it. Tilbury also catalogues a perhaps \nsurprising amount of  the composer\u2019s turbulent \ndomestic and sex life.\nWell before his political views developed in the \nearly 1970s \u2013 turning him, some would say, into \neverything but a good composer \u2013 Cardew had \nalready seen well beyond the dots he was putting \non the pages of  his scores. His critique of  musi-\ncal notation (not least in his thought-provoking \narticle \u2018Notation \u2013 Interpretation, etc.\u2019, written \nfor Tempo in 1961) emerged around 1960 out of  \nhis increasing disillusionment with the European \navant-garde project embraced by such luminar-\nies as Karlheinz Stockhausen, whose assistant \nCardew was at this time. This in itself  all makes \na rather compelling story since, in Cardew\u2019s (and \nTilbury\u2019s) hands, it goes far beyond the perhaps \narcane, if  important, disputes about the legitima-\ncy both of  the European avant-garde position and \nthat of  John Cage, another influence to be assimi-\nlated and then critiqued.\nThrough his experience of  writing the 193-\npage graphic score, Treatise, between 1963 and \n1967, Cardew came to doubt, at least for a while, \nthe value of  any kind of  notation at all. Tilbury\u2019s \naccounts both of  the composition and various \nrealizations of  Treatise itself, and of  the move \n 14  Curtis Roads,\u2018Grammars as Representations for Music\u2019, \nFoundations of  Computer Music, pp. 403\u201366.\n 15  Max Mathews, \u2018Artists\u2019 Statements I: The past and future of  \ncomputer music\u2019, pp. 85\u20136.\n 16  Karlheinz Stockhausen, in \u2018Artists\u2019 statements II\u2019, p. 198. \nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 07 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\ntempo70\ninto free improvisation with the group AMM that \nproved to be the logical solution to Cardew\u2019s musi-\ncal problems at this time, are among the best parts \nof  this book. The chapter on Treatise, for instance, \nmanages to be more illuminating than anything \nelse I have read before about both the connexions \nthe work has with Ludwig Wittgenstein (a Cardew \nobsession) and the demands that this score makes \nupon its performers. It\u2019s from here that Tilbury\u2019s \nprose style becomes intermittently more jour-\nnalistic; some will object, but for me it is mostly \ndone in a quite appropriate, sometimes revealing, \nmanner.\nWhat I find a little hard to stomach is the occa-\nsionally rather \u2018irksome tone of  certainty, of  irref-\nutability\u2019 (to quote the author\u2019s own present view \nof  Cardew\u2019s book, Stockhausen Serves Imperialism) \nwhich Tilbury adopts on some subjects here: \nwhen attacking what he sees as the backsliding \nof  the European avant-gardists, for instance, who \nare taken to task for such crimes as the \u2018brutaliza-\ntion\u2019 of  the performer. Tilbury can ride such hob-\nbyhorses into the ground. Yet not only Treatise \nand AMM but also The Great Learning (an at times \nbrilliantly perceptive reading) and the Scratch \nOrchestra (created out of  a Morley College class \nand with many more members than just the often-\nquoted Michael Parsons and Howard Skempton, \nhowever important these two were) receive \nmore compelling treatment from Tilbury than \nhis attempts at dissecting some of  Cardew\u2019s early \nscores, on which there is surely a lot more to say.\nAnother complication to the biographical \nnarrative is, inevitably, Cardew\u2019s \u2018big switch\u2019 (as \nhe once described it to me in interview) to what \neventually became a radical Marxist-Leninist \npolitical stance, and the totally different, essen-\ntially tonal, kind of  composition that he felt must \ngo with this. Tilbury carefully examines and dis-\ncusses everything involved here, from the break-\nup of  the Scratch Orchestra and the effects on \nAMM, through the Berlin, Irish and Canadian \npolitical connexions, the arrests and imprison-\nment; all a valiant attempt on the author\u2019s part to \nmake sense of  the sad complexities of  Cardew\u2019s \ngradual immersion into work for the Communist \nparties of  his choice. Tilbury has previously dealt \nwith the \u2018big switch\u2019 by arguing that the concerns \nthat Cardew established for himself  in the 1960s \ncan still be seen even through the perhaps distort-\ning lens of  the composer\u2019s particular political pre-\ndilections of  the 1970s. He doesn\u2019t seem to follow \nthat argument quite so firmly in this book, which \ncommendably avoids any simplistic conclusions. \nThe second half  of  this volume must have cost \nits author a lot of  agonies: for one thing, it used \nto be rumoured that it was Tilbury himself  who \nwas particularly responsible for Cardew\u2019s \u2018big \nswitch\u2019, though that role turns out to have been \nplayed, in Tilbury\u2019s own account, by Keith Rowe. \nTilbury was, nevertheless, a leading participant in \nthis political project in its early stages, when much \nof  Cardew\u2019s energies were devoted to repudiat-\ning all previous \u2018avantgardes\u2019. The nadir of  this \nphase came with Cardew\u2019s 1974 book, Stockhausen \nServes Imperialism (to which Tilbury himself  also \ncontributed).\nIt is always clear from the present volume \nwhere Tilbury\u2019s own political sympathies lie: well \nto the left. However, he was, and remains, unable \nto embrace Cardew\u2019s radical activism and now \ncomes fairly clean about his despair at Cardew\u2019s \neventual stance. I would myself  have been a lot \nmore critical of  Cardew\u2019s sometimes derisory \npolitical compositions, but Tilbury does draw \nattention to Cardew\u2019s unfortunate word-setting \nabilities here: still heresy in the political camp, it \nwould appear. Tilbury\u2019s is, of  course, a privileged \nposition, not least as one of  Cardew\u2019s most regular \nperformers. But he never permits any of  his own \nroles to intrude unnecessarily on his narrative. \nWhat of  Cardew\u2019s death on 12\/13 December \n1981, killed in a hit-and-run accident that has often \nbeen claimed to have been a politically-motivated \nmurder? The details of  this final part of  the story \nare told unflinchingly, the possibility that it was \nnot just an awful accident carefully examined. I \nwell remember those pre-Christmas days of  1981 \nand have always thought that the unusually snowy \nconditions that prevailed suggested a simple acci-\ndent: Cardew was presumably, like so many, walk-\ning in the road to avoid the probably untreated \npavements. Tilbury\u2019s account, while not conclu-\nsive, does after all make me wonder.\nCardew scholarship will benefit enormously \nfrom Tilbury\u2019s tome, though its availability may \nprove as constipating for a while to other endeav-\nours as the years of  waiting for it have already \nbeen; besides, musicologists, as a breed (and music \ncritics, too), get a tongue-lashing from Tilbury \nhimself. Who, for one thing, has the source mate-\nrials to tell any of  these stories differently and with \nconviction? Apart, perhaps, from the subject of  \nthe Scratch Orchestra, for which there are doubt-\nless as many histories as that turbulent group \nhad members (and possibly even more). And \nwhat will now happen to Cardew\u2019s journals and \ncorrespondence?\nFinally, how Cardew will be viewed in the \nfuture, as a musician, as a composer, as a political \nactivist, remains more difficult to anticipate. His \ndeath at the age of  45 has already thickened the \nplot of  his reputation over the last almost three \ndecades, a reputation that has often seemed to \nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 07 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nbook reviews 71\nhang by the thread of  those endless anniversary \nconcerts and other events: the 25th anniversary \nof  the founding of  the Scratch Orchestra, the \n25th anniversary of  the composer\u2019s death, also \nwhat would have been his 70th birthday (I plead \nguilty to organizing a conference for that one), \nand so on.\nBoth his pre-political and his political music con-\ntinue to appear overshadowed by their creator\u2019s \nseismic, to many ultimately negative, move into \npolitics in the early 1970s; and this overshadow-\ning is, more than anyone else\u2019s, their composer\u2019s \nown doing (or undoing).

Oxford Studies in Music Theory, OUP, \n\u00a325.99\/$45.00.\nKofi Agawu, Professor of  Music at Princeton and \nan adjunct professor at the University of  Ghana, \nLegon, writes with equal authority on ethnomu-\nsicology and analytical musicology, particularly in \nthe latter case in the field of  musical semiotics (see \nalso his book, Playing with Signs). His most recent \nbook, Music as Discourse: Semiotic Adventures in \nRomantic Music confirms his status as one of  the \nforemost semiotic analysts of  our time. Its title \nechoes and twists that of  Nattiez\u2019s book, Music and \nDiscourse. Yet the scope of  the book is far broader \nthan these statements might imply. \nThe strength of  this book, paradoxically per-\nhaps, lies in the fact that Agawu asks more ques-\ntions than he answers (a characteristic of  his \nteaching style, also). He seeks to give pointers to \npossible musico-analytic futures that go beyond \nSchenkerism and neo-Riemannian theory; more, \nhe aims to make the reader both think and (impor-\ntantly) listen, making it clear that he expects the in-\ndepth analyses to be followed with score in hand. \nWith this in mind, the book is divided neatly into \ntwo: firstly, \u2018Theory\u2019, in which Agawu sets out his \nstall, and secondly, \u2018Analyses\u2019, in which substantial \nexamples are taken from Liszt, Brahms, Mahler, \nBeethoven and Stravinsky. The actual list of  com-\nposers referred to is actually much longer when \none takes into consideration the examples of  the \nbook\u2019s first part.\nAgawu states that his aim is \u2018to provide per-\nformers, listeners, and analysts with a pretext \nfor playing in and with (the elements of ) musical \ncompositions in order to deepen their apprecia-\ntion and understanding\u2019. Indeed, the word \u2018play\u2019 \nis significant here \u2013 rarely can a treatise that pon-\nders on matters so weighty have had such a light, \nintensely readable, touch. The reader is encour-\naged, even, to recompose in an attempt to \u2018be\u2019 the \ncomposer, at least temporarily \u2013 maybe, even, to \ncapture the joy of  creation itself. A striking exam-\nple of  this is Agawu\u2019s Brahmsian reharmonization \nof  \u2018God Save the King\u2019. This even threatens to be \nfun.\nThe first part, some 192 pages, considers a \nnumber of  questions at the heart of  musico-ana-\nlytical inquiry. Agawu begins by presenting some \nten propositions about music and language. \u2018The \nfact that music is not a system of  communica-\ntion should not discourage us from exploring the \nmessages that music sometimes (intermittently) \ncommunicates\u2019. Then, Agawu explores, in his \n\u2018Preliminary Analytic Adventures\u2019, the problem \nof  examining purely musical attributes in order to \naddress questions of  musical meaning. (Schubert \nD958, Adagio Mozart K576 (i) are the examples \nhere).\nOne of  the most appealing ideas represented \nhere is an examination of  \u2018topics\u2019 and how one \ncan use them to restructure one\u2019s way of  hear-\ning in the hope of  describing musical content \neffectively. Here, Agawu draws on Ratner (Classic \nMusic: Expression, Form, and Style) to introduce \nwhat Ratner calls \u2018subjects for musical discourse\u2019. \nAgawu lists 61 topics, from Alberti bass through \nFrench Overture and \u2018Lebewohl\u2019 (horn figure) to \nSturm und Drang and waltz. He then compares lists \nby other interested parties ( Janice Dickensheets \nand M\u00e1rta Grab\u00f3cz) before suggesting 18 topics \npertinent to Mahler (a composer whose Ninth \nSymphony first movement forms the basis of  one \nof  the Part II extended analyses). Agawu\u2019s identi-\nfication of  three basic \u2018modes of  enunciation\u2019 as \nSpeech Mode, Song Mode and Dance Mode fur-\nther stocks the analyst\u2019s armoury.\nAfter an examination of  \u2018Bridges to Free \nComposition\u2019 with an examination of  previous \nideas of  Sechter, Czerny, Ratz and Tovey, Agawu \nintroduces paradigmatic analysis, a predominant-\nly semiotic tool (see Ruwet, Lidov, Monelle etc) \nused to arrange the signifying units into groups, \ncolumns or paradigms according to chosen crite-\nria. As he puts it, \u2018paradigmatic analysis does not \ntell you what a work means; rather, it makes pos-\nsible individual tellings of  how it means\u2019(p. 271).\nBy using his technologies as launching pads for \nruminative thought, Agawu is able to take the first \nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 07 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\ntempo72\nmovement of  Beethoven\u2019s String Quartet op. 18\/3 \nand examine the use of  tonal models \u2013 his example \non page 187 aligns previously identified units with \ntonal models (simply stated, I\u2013V\u2013I in four vari-\nants, I\u2013V and V\u2013I). Schenkerian notation is used \nto explain origins of  the models in the music\u2019s \nsurface. Their composing out is explicated by a \nlist of  topics ranging from bourr\u00e9e to \u2018alla zoppa\u2019 \nand \u2018Sturm und Drang\u2019. The whole is a virtuosic \nworking-out and demonstration of  techniques, \nyet it results in a satisfying and musically enriching \nanalysis in its own right. The same can be said of  \nall of  the analyses Agawu presents: although there \nto substantiate points, the analyses in the central \npart of  the book all offer substantial insight above \nand beyond the call of  duty.\nAgawu\u2019s analytical methodology here compris-\nes the sequence of  outer form, segmentation of  \npiece into units and explication of  their substance, \na summary of  this into a paradigmatic chart of  \nunits with optional additional headings of  \u2018form\u2019 \nand \u2018meaning\u2019. The actual choice of  pieces is fas-\ncinating and the works are not necessarily core \nrepertoire: Liszt\u2019s Orpheus, for example, only \nrarely makes it to the concert platform these days. \nAgawu is laudably unafraid to use value-based \nterminology when referring to passages \u2013 \u2018beau-\ntiful\u2019 is a word that was completely absent from \nany respectable analyst\u2019s vocabulary a couple of  \ndecades back.\nInevitably, in a book of  questions, an epilogue \nis going to be no neat tidying-up exercise. Indeed, \nAgawu reminds us of  the basic questions he asks, \nand suggests further ones while recapitulating the \nstructure of  the book. He ends with a plea \nto remain curious about the inner workings of  our art \n\u2026 If, as Anthony Pople suggests, \u2018meaning is a journey \nrather than a destination\u2019, then edification will come \nfrom doing, from undertaking the journey (p. 320).\nFootnotes are detailed, and the bibliography \nalone makes the price of  this book worthwhile, \nwhile simultaneously acting as a reminder of  \nAgawu\u2019s huge frame of  reference.\nColin Clarke\nThe Cambridge Companion to Shostakovich ed.

Mobility of  meaning is particularly charac-\nteristic of  Shostakovich\u2019s output, which offers, \naccording to Taruskin, \u2018a tabula rasa on which all \nand sundry could inscribe their various messages \nwith a minimum of  resistance\u2019 (Ibid.). For many \ndecades, such inscriptions have of  course been \ndominated by those that read the music in the light \nof  its relationship with the Soviet state: Eric Levi, \nin his contribution to The Cambridge Companion to \nShostakovich, describes the composer as a \u2018politi-\ncal football\u2019 (p. 287) as commentators motivated \nby ideological concerns sought to praise or con-\ndemn the influence that politics had on the music. \nOthers have taken the opposite approach, which, \nbroadly speaking, looks at the ways in which \nShostakovich encodes his own political resistance \nwithin the music. In either case, the music is at risk \nof  becoming a cipher.\nIt is against this background that the editors of  \nThe Cambridge Companion seek to position their \nvolume: the publisher\u2019s blurb on the back claims \nthat the book \noffers a new starting point and a guide for readers who \nseek a fuller understanding of  Shostakovich\u2019s place in \nthe history of  music. Bringing together an interna-\ntional team of  scholars, the book brings up-to-date \nresearch to bear on the full range of  Shostakovich\u2019s \nmusical output. \nThe strategies involved in developing \u2018a fuller \nunderstanding\u2019 and covering \u2018the full range\u2019 of  the \ncomposer\u2019s compositions are similar: contribu-\ntions discuss most (though by no means not all) \nof  the composer\u2019s output, arranged by genre and \nincluding hitherto unfashionable areas such as \nShostakovich\u2019s political music and his scores for \nfilm, and many authors contextualise this work \nwith reference to external events.\nThis approach certainly brings breadth to the \nstudy; it inevitably leads to an unevenness of  \ndepth, however. This is in part a consequence \nof  the availability of  resources to date. The sec-\nond section of  the book, for example, discusses \nShostakovich\u2019s music for stage and screen. Here, \nthe relative unfamiliarity of  much of  the reper-\ntoire has led contributors to discuss scenarios and \nplots, Shostakovich\u2019s methods of  artistic collabo-\nration, and the political background against which \nthis work took place. The importance of  this area \nof  Shostakovich\u2019s output resonates throughout \nthe volume \u2013 Gerard McBurney, for instance, dis-\ncusses how the theatre provided a \u2018laboratory\u2019 \nin which Shostakovich could experiment; hints \nof  this can be found in Shostakovich\u2019s early sym-\nphonies (Roseberry, 15). Crucial too, is the way \nin which the composer developed a \u2018cool-headed \ngrasp of  the way the same music could bear dif-\nferent meanings in different contexts\u2019 (McBurney, \n147). This observation underlines the semantic \nfluidity to be found in the composer\u2019s work, and \nguards against the tendency noted by Francis \nMaes \u2018to approach the songs mainly with a desire \nfor unequivocal answers to vexing questions of  \nmeaning in Shostakovich\u2019s music\u2019 (231). Yet it is \ntelling, too, that the chapters on dramatic music \ncontain no musical examples, and in some cases \nonly passing reference to the music at all.\nBy way of  contrast, the editors single out (p. \n2) those contributions that are more analytical in \nfocus, which are all grouped together in the first \nsection of  the book, \u2018Instrumental works\u2019. Three \nof  these five explore a single genre: Eric Roseberry \ntackles the symphonies, Judith Kuhn the string \nquartets and Malcolm MacDonald the string con-\ncertos and sonatas. David Fanning adopts a more \nhistorical approach in his exploration of  the early \nmusic leading up to the First Symphony, whereas \nDavid Haas concentrates on a single work (the \nSecond Piano Sonata). The contributions don\u2019t \nquite succeed in covering \u2018the full range\u2019 of  \nShostakovich\u2019s instrumental outputs \u2013 the piano \nmusic is only patchily covered, for example, \nthough certain works are mentioned again in later \nchapters \u2013 and the shifting of  focus from large \ngroups of  works (the symphonies and string quar-\ntets) to single works (the Second Sonata) leads to \nan unevenness in the amount of  detail that can be \nprovided. \nRounding off  the volume are two chapters \non the songs (Francis Maes) and political works \n(Pauline Fairclough) \u2013 the latter venturing into \npreviously uncharted territory in Western \nShostakovich scholarship \u2013 followed by a range \nof  essays that provide alternative viewpoints on \nthe composer. The first of  these, by Erik Levi, was \ndiscussed above. David Haas provides an interest-\ning survey not only of  Shostakovich\u2019s harmonic \nlanguage, but also the ways in which Soviet and \nWestern theorists alike have tried to explain it. \nDavid Fanning studies Shostakovich\u2019s recorded \nperformances of  his work, and the final chap-\nter offers an interpretation of  \u2018Jewish existential \nirony\u2019 in the music (Esti Sheinberg).\nTaken as a whole, The Cambridge Companion \nto Shostakovich goes a considerable way towards \nachieving the ambitious task it set itself. The com-\nprehensive but not-quite-exhaustive coverage of  \nthe output throws new light on the composer\u2019s \nwork, and particularly the way the \u2018lesser\u2019 activi-\nties inform the music on which Shostakovich\u2019s \nreputation is built. And yet for all of  the broad \nsweep of  submissions, it is the latter, and particu-\nlarly the instrumental works, that remains at the \ncore of  this volume, where the music itself  forms \nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 07 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\ntempo74\nthe main focus of  discussion (and this discussion is \noften analytical in nature). \nIt is to the instrumental music, and specifically \nthe String Quartets Nos. 6\u20139, that Sarah Reichardt \nturns. Reichardt\u2019s programme is ambitious: her \n\u2018concern is with tacitly desexualized modern sub-\njectivity (reflecting the blankness created by the \nalienation of  modernity) and how the patholo-\ngies of  this desexualized subject are reflected in \nShostakovich\u2019s music\u2019 (p. 12). More specifically, \nReichardt claims that \u2018reading the ambiguities \nwritten into the string quartets through the lens of  \nthe real reveals the arbitrary and contingent state \nof  the musical subject\u2019s constructed universe\u2019 \n(15). Such an aim, and the theoretical arsenal that \nReichardt assembles in order to achieve it, runs \nthe risk of  (once again) reducing Shostakovich \nto a cipher. To counter this, Reichardt remains in \nclose contact with the music: all interpretations \nspring from a noteworthy musical detail and the \nconsequences of  this detail are mapped out in \nclose readings.\nTo argue for an interpretation is one thing; \nfor it to be plausible is another. It is the return of  \na cadential figure in the Sixth Quartet that moti-\nvates a series of  reflections that take in, over the \ncourse of  four densely packed pages, textual grafts \n(Derrida), the possibility of  endings (Adorno), \nruptures of  reality (Lacan) and techniques for \navoiding the consequences of  recognising such \nruptures (\u017di\u017eek) and epistemic knowledge \n(Foucault) (pp. 20\u201323). The result of  this is that \nthe first three movements of  the Sixth Quartet \nare seen as embodying a different knowledge \nbase (Modern, Classical, Renaissance) as they try \n\u2018to avoid acknowledging the emptiness behind \nits reality by acting as if  ruptures in its symbolic \nconstruction do not exist\u2019 (23). The final move-\nment, on the other hand, offers a new episteme \n\u2018that acknowledge the ruptures of  the real and \nattempts to integrate them into constructed real-\nity\u2019 (37\u20138). Such claims are argued with reference \nto the score, with Hepokoski and Darcy\u2019s sonata \ndeformation theory as an important point of  ref-\nerence ( Judith Kuhn\u2019s chapter in The Cambridge \nCompanion uses a similar strategy). There is some-\nthing a little too neat about the argument \u2013 not \nleast the ways in which the quartet conveniently \nreviews each episteme in turn \u2013 although it makes \nfor an interesting conceit (and one that certainly \nforces this listener, at any rate, to listen again more \ncarefully). Something of  the same is true for the \nshort chapter on the Ninth Quartet, which of  all \nthe chapters contains the least engagement with \nthe music.\nThe argument becomes much more persuasive \nwhen Reichardt turns to the Seventh and Eighth \nQuartets. As with the Sixth, the identification of  a \nproblematic musical feature (respectively the rep-\netition of  the coda of  the first movement in the \nthird and the multiple recurrences of  the D\u2013S\u2013\nC\u2013H motif ) motivates the interpretation. For the \nSeventh, the notion of  Coda as a supplement and \nthus death (pace Derrida) is supported by reference \nto Formenlehre and, crucially, expressive topics \nwithin the music (such the funereal air of  the sec-\nond movement, coupled with intertextual links to \nLady Macbeth). In the case of  the Eighth Quartet, \ndeath once again hovers over the proceedings and, \nin conjunction with the resistance of  the omni-\npresent motto to integration, provides a \u2018dualistic \nrepresentation of  a utopian struggle for freedom \nagainst the brutality and arbitrary authority that \ndetermines everyday existence\u2019 (97). \nThe sense that something is lacking is char-\nacteristic of  modern subjectivity, and Reichardt \nargues that the power of  music, and in particular \nShostakovich\u2019s, lies in its ability to represent this \nlack, to give it voice. In this way, Shostakovich\u2019s \nmusic transcends the time in which it was written \n\u2013 it is more than just \u2018a witness for the citizenry \nof  the Soviet State\u2019 \u2013 for it \u2018presents us with a \nmeans of  preserving our sense of  humanity with-\nin the midst of  universal nonsense\u2019 (120). These \nare claims on the grandest scale, and at times the \nweight of  the intellectual edifices constructed in \norder to substantiate them threaten to overwhelm \nthe object of  study. Nevertheless, the attempt \nmade in Composing the Modern Subject to examine \nthe ways in which Shostakovich\u2019s music continues \nto resonate with modern audiences bears careful \nreading. Even if  one ultimately disagrees with its \nconclusions, the seriousness with which it takes \nthe quartets is testimony to their enduring expres-\nsive power.\nEdward Venn \nSounding Postmodernism: Sampling Australian Composers, \nSound Artists and Music Critics by David Bennett. \nAustralian Music Centre, \u00a350.00.\nSounding Postmodernism is formed from two stud-\nies conducted by the Melbourne-based scholar, \nDavid Bennett. The first \u2013 Sampling Australian \nComposers \u2013 is a theory-focussed polemical investi-\ngation into the aesthetics of  musical postmodern-\nism, whilst the second \u2013 Sound Artists and Music \nCritics \u2013 presents 36 responses to a questionnaire \nundertaken between 2004 and 2008. \nBringing together these two inquiries is a dif-\nficult task, and one that is largely placed on the \nreader\u2019s shoulders, with only \u2018A Raider\u2019s Guide\u2019 \nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 07 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nbook reviews 75\nfor orientation. This \u2018Polemical Preface\u2019 begins \ncandidly: \u2018Let\u2019s be frank. Some readers of  this \nbook \u2013 perhaps most of  you \u2013will wish to turn \nstraight to Part 2\u2019 (p. 8). For those who continue, a \ncaution awaits in the second chapter: \nPerhaps I should begin with a caution: this is not a \nbook about art music or sound art, still less one about \njazz or popular music; rather it is an investigation \ninto musical aesthetics, based on the uncontroversial \nassumption that how we listen to the arts of  sound is \ninfluenced by our preconceptions about the history \nand cultured meanings of  musical forms and styles, \nintervals, rhythms, timbres and so forth \u2013 and that \nsuch preconceptions are therefore worth investigating \nin their own right. (p. 11)\nBennett\u2019s cautiousness about a reader\u2019s level of  \ncommitment and interest is itself  the reader\u2019s best \ncompass, pointing directly to the nub of  the prob-\nlem: that practising sound artists (whatever their \nilk) and those engaged in the theorizing of  their \nart, are almost mutually exclusive categories; the \nresponses to postmodernism from both groups \nalso appeal to different readerships. It may not \nbe a reader-friendly mode of  presentation \u2013 why \nshould it be otherwise? \u2013 but it is an honest, \nstraightforward, pragmatic and effective manner \nof  addressing postmodernism in music. This is \na book that adds significantly to the existing dis-\ncourse.\nThe two parts of  this book are ultimately \ninterconnected, with the first making use of  the \nanswers given in the second, whilst the question-\nnaire is most usefully read in the light of  Bennett\u2019s \nopening chapters. His writing is lucid, and his \nadoption of  the genre of  the polemic is useful in \nassuaging immediate criticisms of  each argument \nso that a complex, interrelated exploration of  the \ntopic can be sustained.\nEach chapter of  the first part addresses a differ-\nent aspect of  the postmodern argument. This is \nmaterial that gives life to a postmodern perspec-\ntive, as Bennett moves swiftly between art forms \nof  differing eras to raise a range of  understand-\nings attached to postmodernism. As a resource for \nthose approaching the subject for the first time, \nthose teaching this theory and those who work \noutside the sonic arts, this book will be of  especial \nvalue. By devoting as much space to the mis-read-\nings of  postmodern theory as to its theorizing, \nBennett cunningly contextualizes modernist par-\nadigms of  interpretation.\nThere are passages that are too reliant on \na US-forged perspective, such as the chapter \n\u2018Post-postmodernism, post 9\/11\u2019, which places \ntoo much emphasis on localized practices to be \nincisive in a non-American context. Here, as else-\nwhere, I find Bennett\u2019s articulation of  the music \nof  modernism too narrow. Significant space \nis devoted to exploring modernist hegemony \nthrough critiquing the procedures (qua the forma-\ntion of  \u2018Musical modernism\u2019s grand narrative\u2019) of  \nSchoenberg, Boulez, Stockhausen and Messiaen, \nas a \u2018stranglehold\u2019 (p. 65) of  orthodoxy. Uncovering \ncracks in the rhetoric of  high modernism is a task \naccomplished long ago (if  it was necessary at all), \nin no small part through the late writings of  the \nearly exponents of  the style. Bennett frequently \nquotes from those quick to raise a finger to \u2018musi-\ncal modernism\u2019 without separation of  commen-\ntary and music. Such a penchant for the dramatic \nstatement in the place of  musical description aids \nlittle in the understanding of  modernism, post-\nmodernsim or associated musics, privileging the \n\u2018cruel\u2019 (p. 26), the \u2018sadomasochistic\u2019 (p. 24) and the \n\u2018creepy\u2019 (p. 64) in place of  the generous and the \nambitious.\nMy criticism here is not one of  Bennett\u2019s under-\nstanding of  modernism (though it differs mark-\nedly from my own), but with the omniscience of  \nperspective that he adopts. By arguing his points \nthrough the opinions of  others (\u2018preconceptions \n[\u2026] worth investigating in their own right\u2019) at the \nsame time as making decisions about which oth-\ners are quoted \u2013 decisions that are not explained in \nthe text \u2013  Bennett supports a stance that conflates \nthe text of  music with its paratexts. To be clear, \nthis is not a criticism of  his approach per se, but of  \na non-music-specialist working with living com-\nposers, now. I would have valued a more overtly \nidiosyncratic style that revealed more explicitly \nBennett\u2019s take on his sources.\nA similar issue faces the reader throughout the \nsecond part of  the book, wherein lie the responses \nto Bennett questionnaire. For the most part, those \ncomposers who responded do so with reluctance, \nindicating frequently their discomfort with being \nasked to engage with the specific questions asked. \nFor example, Cat Hope writes that \u2018terms are a \nbusiness for historians, not artists\u2019 and Anthony \nPateras similarly responds that \u2018The ideas are dealt \nwith through practice, and that\u2019s that\u2019 and, later: \n\u2018Yes, but it\u2019s not the kind of  thing you can describe \naccurately in writing\u2019. Andrew Ford remarks that \n\u2018To have any chance of  saying something sen-\nsible, you need to discuss an individual artwork\u2019 \n(p. 239). To a significant degree this issue could be \nmitigated by adopting a methodology of  discus-\nsion, engaging the composers in a more equitable, \nconversational manner to elicit responses that are \nmore anecdotal. \nAsking 36 practitioners the same 28 ques-\ntions is, however, revealing. Some choose only to \nanswer a handful of  questions, whilst others give \nfull and detailed answers even when the questions \nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 07 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\ntempo76\nmove them out of  their field. Some responses \nquote from postmodern theory in an academi-\ncally secure manner, whilst others respond as one \nmight to an e-mail. Eliciting responses about, for \nexample, electronic music from score-based com-\nposers gives significant insight into their music \nthat would otherwise be inaccessible.\nConversely, asking the same questions to all \npractitioners fails to engage some respondents \ndeeply enough, and denies the significant benefit \nof  a follow-up question. I cringed when Roger \nDean, an internationally leading figure in inter-\nactive creativity, was asked: \u2018Do you make use of  \ndigital technology and\/or Web in composition \n(other than notation software)?\u2019 More generally, \ntoo many of  the answers given seem overly nega-\ntive, which is as much, I suspect, indicative of  the \nformat of  the questionnaire rather than the ques-\ntions\u2019 contents.\nThese criticisms aside, the book remains a valu-\nable location for those interested in the responses \nof  (Australian) composers to postmodernism. \nBennett\u2019s contribution is deeply polemical, for \nwhich he is to be applauded.\nMichael Hooper\n"}
