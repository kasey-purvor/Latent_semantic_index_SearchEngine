Under the influence of a very high magnetic field,\nthe electron-plasma that is formed at high excitation powers is \u2018frozen-out\u2019 into a state of optically\ninactive magneto-excitons.\nPhotoexcited carriers in a semiconductor are a model\nsystem where we have ready means to both control-\nlably generate and, through the recombination lumines-\ncence, probe the energy levels and statistics of the ex-\nciton population. At low excitation power, the Wan-\nnier excitons can be treated as independent, much like a\ngas of non-interacting hydrogenic atoms. A larger den-\nsity of such entities can lead to the formation of molec-\nular, liquid, metallic, or superfluid phases[1, 2]. The\nlow and high density regimes are also separated by a\nMott transition between the \u201cinsulating\u201d excitonic state\nof bound electron-hole pairs and the plasma state, which\noccurs due to the combination of enhanced screening,\nbandgap remormalization, and non-zero bandwidths at\nhigh carrier densities. While the dynamics of photoex-\ncited carriers, the nature of the non-equilibrium distri-\nbution functions, excitonic dephasing, and the transition\nitself continue to be actively studied, mainly through\ntime-resolved studies, in bulk and low-dimensional semi-\nconductor samples[3, 4, 5, 6, 7], there has also been an in-\ncreasing interest in probing the phases of \u201cspatially indi-\nrect\u201d excitons in systems like type-II quantum wells and\ncoupled quantum wells with complimentary doping[2].\nWe have studied the photoluminescence (PL) spectra\nfrom a type-II self-assembled quantum dot (QD) ensem-\nble. Due to the staggered band alignment at the GaSb-\nGaAs interface[8, 9, 10, 11], the GaSb QDs contained\nwithin the GaAs matrix[8] confine the holes[9], but act as\nantidots for the electrons [Fig.1]. Under non-resonant op-\ntical excitation, the electron-hole pairs generated are spa-\ntially separated, with the electrons being loosely bound\nto the charge of the holes within the QDs[9, 10, 11]. As a\nresult, we have yet another kind of spatially-indirect ex-\nciton where the charge distribution of the excluded elec-\ntrons is self-consistently determined such that it corre-\nsponds to the minimum energy configuration[14], possi-\nbly with interesting topological consequences[12, 13, 14].\n\u2217Present Address: High Field Magnet Laboratory, Radboud Uni-\nversity, Nijmegen 6525 ED, The Netherlands.\nThese excitons have no centre of mass degree of freedom\nand the average charge of the QDs can be tuned by the\nstrength of the optical excitation[11, 15, 16]. They do not\nform excitonic \u201cmolecules\u201d; the biexcitons are rather like\nnew \u201celements\u201d with different \u201cnuclear\u201d charge[11, 15].\nThe upper bound on the exciton density is determined\nby the spatial density of the randomly positioned QDs.\nStudying the PL spectra from GaSb QDs at different\nexcitation powers and in high magnetic fields, we have\nencountered two Mott transitions. These are discussed\nhere.\nThe details of sample growth by metal-organic vapor\nphase epitaxy and their characterization are described\nin reference 8. The particular sample measured in this\nstudy corresponds to a growth interruption of 2 seconds\nand a QD density of about 3 \u00d7 1010 cm\u22122 [8]. The low\ntemperature PL spectra exhibit two prominent peaks,\nfrom the wetting layer (WL) at about 900 nm and the\nQD ensemble at about 1100 nm [Fig.2]. The ratio of\nthe WL to the QD PL intensities is strongly excitation\npower-dependent. This gives an indication of the rela-\ntive populations of carriers in the two regions. In the\nrange of excitation powers studied here[17], there was\na monotonic blue-shift of the PL peak position with in-\n-\nGaAsGaAs\nVB\nCBE\nz\n+\n+\n-\nWL QD\nGaSb\nFIG. 1: Simplified band diagram showing spatially indirect\nexcitons with electrons in the GaAs matrix and holes in the\nGaSb valence band of the WL and QD. z-axis denotes the\ngrowth direction and the QDs are distributed in the xy-plane.\nNote that the electrons of the WL excitons may screen the\nCoulomb interaction of the QD exciton and vice-versa. The\nband diagram from an 8-band k\u00b7p calculation can be found in\nreference 11. The strength of the excitonic binding is weak-\nened by the presence of the barrier potential.\nTypeset by REVTEX\n2creasing excitation power [Fig. 3(a)]. Unfortunately, this\ncontribution of the capacitive charging energy associated\nwith the increased hole occupancy at higher excitation\npowers[11, 15] completely masks the bandgap renormal-\nization effects.\nThis letter describes the results of non-resonant PL\nmeasurements (excitation wavelength of 514 nm) in\nhigh magnetic fields of \u226445 T. All the magnetic field-\ndependent measurements described in this study were\nperformed in pulsed magnetic fields and using a liquid\nnitrogen-cooled InGaAs linear array detector. The detec-\ntor\u2019s exposure time was chosen depending on the emis-\nsion intensity. The number of exposures per field pulse\nwere determined by the condition that the variation of\nthe magnetic field B, [\n\u221a\n\u3008B2\u3009 \u2212 \u3008B\u30092\/\u3008B\u3009] during the ex-\nposure was less than 5%. Spectra were measured in both\nthe rising and the trailing edges and it was ensured that\nthe magnetic field-dependent change in the peak-position\nof the PL spectra (henceforth called PL peak-shift) in-\nferred from spectra taken in different field pulses had\nconsiderable overlaps in the magnetic field ranges they\ncovered.\nThe PL peak-shift contains valuable information about\nthe excitonic states.

The emission around 1.1 eV is from QDs\nand the higher energy peak is due to the WL. The QD spectra\nconsiderably broaden at higher excitation powers, indicating\nthe loss of excitonic resonance. Relative to the QD emission,\nthe WL emission gets stronger as the excitation power is in-\ncreased. The asymmetry and shoulder in the WL peak is due\nto the sharp cut-off in the detector response at \u223c 1.38 eV.\n(inset)A comparison of 0.2 Wcm\u22122 spectra (scaled and offset\nboth on the energy and the intensity axes and now plotted on\nlinear scale), measured at 15 K (B=0 T) and 185 K (B=0 T,\n45 T), show that at this low power the emission linewidth and\nthe spectral shape are completely determined by the inhomo-\ngeneous broadening and are independent of magnetic field and\ntemperature. The lineshape is Gaussian. The WL emission\ndisappears above around 60 K.\nexcitonic (hydrogenic) ground state at very low fields cor-\nresponds to a diamagnetic shift that is to the lowest order\nin perturbation theory quadratic in the magnetic field,\n\u2206E \u223c [q2\u3008\u03c12\u3009\/8\u00b5]B2. The high field regime is equivalent\nto having \u201cfree\u201d electrons and holes recombining from\ntheir respective Landau level ground states. Thus the\nshift is linear at very high fields, \u2206E \u223c [~q\/2\u00b5]B. q is\nabsolute value of the electron charge, \u00b5 the reduced mass\nof the electron-hole pair, and\n\u221a\n\u3008\u03c12\u3009 is the exciton radius.\nThese functional forms are strictly valid only in the two\nasymptotic limits, but are a good approximation[18] for\n\u03b2 . 0.4 and \u03b2 & 1 respectively, if \u03b2 is the ratio of the\ncyclotron energy to twice the effective exciton Rydberg\nenergy. As the simplest approximation, a functional form\nfor the PL peak-shift for 0.4 . \u03b2 . 1.0 may be extrap-\nolated by demanding adiabatic continuity between the\ntwo regimes and assuming that diamagnetic contribu-\ntion extends up to \u03b2 = 1. This leads to the following\nphenomenologically successful relationship [e.g. Ref. 19]\nto describe the PL peak-shift for all \u03b2:\n\u2206E =\nq2\u3008\u03c12\u3009\n8\u00b5\nB2, forB < Bc (1a)\n\u2206E = \u2212\n~\n2\n2\u00b5\u3008\u03c12\u3009\n+\n~q\n2\u00b5\nB, forB > Bc (1b)\nThe crossover field Bc = 2~\/(q\u3008\u03c1\n2\u3009). The first term in\nEq.(1b) corresponds to the excitonic binding energy and\nis the extrapolation of the high-field slope [second term\nin Eq.(1b)] to B = 0.\nFig.3(a) shows the PL peak-shift at different powers\nof the excitation laser measured in magnetic fields of up\nto about 15 T with the sample at 4.2 K. Fitting these\ndata to Eq.1 gives a direct way to measure the excitonic\nbinding energies and the radii. The results are shown in\nFig.3(c). The value of the average binding energy of the\nexciton decreases from 4.5 meV to less than 0.5 meV as\nthe excitation power is increased by one and half orders\nof magnitude. The evolution is accompanied by the cor-\nresponding increase in the exciton radius from 8 nm to\nabout 25 nm. We thus have an indication of the system\nprogressing toward a Mott transition[20]. The peak-shift\nobservations correlate well with the zero-field emission\nspectra of Fig.2, where despite the large inhomogeneous\nbroadening, the loss of excitonic resonance is clearly ob-\nserved by the broadening of the high energy tail and the\nsignificant increase in linewidth at high excitation power\n[also see Fig.4(d)]. Reference 21 also reports a similar\nbroadening.\nThe weakening of the binding of electrons from a spe-\ncific site can be related to two effects. Of primary impor-\ntance is the higher electron density, especially of those\nelectrons which participate in the WL PL. Fig.2 shows\nthat the WL PL intensity increases much faster than the\nQD PL intensity, implying a greater role of screening\nat higher excitation power. Specifically, there exists a\n3critical screening length \u03bbc beyond which the positively\ncharged dots do not support bound (exciton) states.\nWhile for a 3D system with Yukawa interaction[22] \u03bbc is\n0.84aB, in the actual QD ensemble the barrier potentials\nat the QD-matrix heterointerface further aid ionization.\nQDs are also not a homogeneous three-dimensional sys-\ntem because the electrons are constrained to the upper\nhalf of the semi-infinite matrix (excluded by the WL),\nbut still attracted to the holes in the dots and the WL.\nSecondly, since the average separation of the randomly\nlocated QDs in the present sample is about 50\u201360 nm,\nfor exciton sizes of about 25 nm there may be an overlap\nbetween some excitons with their neighbors. The delo-\ncalization of a few electrons can further aid in screening,\nleading to further ionization.\nFig.4 extends the study to much higher magnetic fields\n(B<45 T). For practical reasons pertaining to helium tur-\nbulence during the pulse, the high field experiments had\nto be performed in a helium flow cryostat at a temper-\nature of about 15 K. It is likely that the slight increase\nin temperature has further aided ionization. The obser-\nvation of a very large linewidth in Fig.2, at the excita-\ntion power of 10 Wcm\u22122, was indicative of the forma-\ntion of the plasma phase.

The PL peak-shift shows an\nunexpected change in slope around 15 T and it can no\nlonger be described by Eq.1 in the entire field range.\nQualitatively, a linear peak-shift at low fields (indica-\ntive of the electron plasma state with near-zero bind-\ning energy [cf. Eq.1] ) transforms to a curve described\nby Eq.1 (dotted line in Fig.4(a)). This transition from\nlinear to quadratic dependence[23] is due to the mag-\nnetic field-induced stabilization[5] of the insulating mag-\nnetoexciton state[12, 13, 14]\u2014an arbitrarily weak 1D (ef-\nfective dimensionality is reduced on account of 2D mag-\nnetic confinement) potential must support at least one\nbound state. This is similar to the field-induced impu-\nrity freeze-out phenomenon[5] of semiconductor physics.\nBetween Fig.4(a) and (b) (and other measurements at\nintermediate powers) we observe an increase in slope of\nthe field dependence of peak-shift at low magnetic fields.\nThis suggests a coexistence of two phases, due to distri-\nbution of critical screening lengths for different sized-QD\nin the ensemble. Note that Fig.4(c), where we began\nwith a clearly bound excitonic state at B=0, Eq.1 [solid\nline in Fig.4(c)] describes the PL peak-shift in the entire\nfield range and there is no Mott transition.\nIndependent evidence of the above described phenom-\nena is provided by the difference in the field depen-\ndence of the linewidths of the spectra measured at dif-\nferent excitation powers [Fig.2(inset) and Fig.4(d)]. The\nlinewidth is nearly constant up to 45 T for the spectra\nmeasured at the excitation power of 0.2 and 1 Wcm\u22122,\ncompletely determined by the inhomogeneous broaden-\ning. Fig.2(inset) shows that increasing the measurement\ntemperature to as high as 185 K also does not affect the\nspectral shape.\nOn the other hand, there is a \u223c 30% decrease in the\nlinewidth of the spectra measured at 10 Wcm\u22122[Fig.4(d)]\nin an applied magnetic field. The linewidth is almost\nconstant in plasma phase below 15 T and the decrease\ncorrelates with the anomaly in the peak-shift data. Fur-\nthermore, in high magnetic field, the linewidth again\ntends toward the inhomogeneous broadening-limited\nvalue measured for the excitons at lower laser powers.\nNote that this behavior is hard to explain if we assume\nthat the linewidth enhancement is due to state filling\nalone[21].\nFig.4(d) thus serves the purpose of a rough \u201cphase di-\nagram\u201d, where the upper part of the graph correspond-\ning to large linewidths denotes the plasma phase and\nthe lower part the (inhomogeneously broadened) exciton\nphase. It is clarified that the Mott transition is a zero-\ntemperature phenomenon and thus the measurements de-\nscribed in Fig.4(d) and the rest of the paper only depict\nmagnetic field-, excitation power- and temperature-aided\nexcursions to various phases.\nThe highly non-equilibrium nature of the phenomena\nrequires the generation of a large number of photoex-\n40 10 20 30 40 50\n80\n100\n120\n140\n160\n180\n200\nL\nin\ne\nw\nid\nth\n (\nm\ne\nV\n)\nMagnetic Field (Tesla)\n10.0 Wcm\n-2\n1.0 Wcm\n-2\n  0.2 Wcm\n-2\n(d)\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n0\n3\n6\n9\n12\n15\n0 10 20 30 40 50\n0\n3\n6\n9\n12\n15\n(a)\n10 Wcm\n-2\n(b)\n1 Wcm\n-2\n(c)\n0.2 Wcm\n-2\nP\ne\na\nk\n s\nh\nif\nt \n(m\ne\nV\n)\nMagnetic Field (Tesla)\nFIG. 4: PL peak-shift (B\u2264 45 T) at different excitation\npowers.

However, this heating is only a perturbation to the\nexperimental conditions: Firstly, the zero-magnetic field\nPL spectra showed a strong temperature dependence at\nall laser powers and the zero-field PL spectra measured\nat different powers all merged to a single curve beyond\n100 K (not shown). These observations indicate that the\ndifference in the sample heating was of the order of about\n10K between the lowest and the highest powers. Further-\nmore, we observe in Fig.2 that the the loss of excitonic\nresonance due to many body effects which change the\nfunctional form of the spectral density is different from\nthe thermal ionization of excitons. For the spectra mea-\nsured at 185K and the excitation power of 0.2 Wcm\u22122,\nthe inhomogeneous linewidth is unaffected despite the\nlarge temperature change.\nFinally, we mention that the emission intensities were\nmagnetic field-dependent. Unlike for type-I dots, we ob-\nserved a magnetic field-induced PL quenching, which sug-\ngests that the ground state of magnetoexcitons in our\nsample is dark with a possibility of a gap that can be\novercome at high temperatures.\nConclusions.\u2014We have studied the different phases of\nspatially indirect excitons in an ensemble of GaSb QDs\ncontained within a GaAs matrix. We have observed sys-\ntematic changes in the excitonic binding energy and the\nexciton Bohr radii with changing electron-hole density\n[Fig.3]. These are interpreted as the transition from an\ninsulating excitonic phase to a single component plasma\nphase. The magnetic field induced shift of the peak en-\nergy of the PL spectra, when the system is in the plasma\nphase, shows an anomalous functional form [Fig.4] that\nis indicative of a phase transition. This is attributed to\na second Mott transition back to the insulating magne-\ntoexciton state. The loss and the recovery of the excitonic\nresonance was independently tracked [Fig.2 and Fig.4(d)]\nby observing the changes in the inhomogeneous linewidth\nas a function of excitation power and magnetic field.\nThis work is supported by the Belgian IAP, the\nSANDiE Network of Excellence (Contract no.

The present\nstudy is limited to higher powers where we observe the\nconventional blue-shift, the physics of the OICD is not\nrelevant.\n[18] R. P. Seisyan and B.P.

Comm. 104,\n287 (1997).], but later interpreted as a manifestation of\n5the \u201chidden symmetry\u201d [E. I. Rashba and M. D. Sturge,\nPhys. Rev. B 63, 045305 (2000)]. The latter explanation\nis ruled out here because our excitons are not 2D.\n"}
