The aim of this research was to ascertain the \nlevel of confidence of students completing a one-year primary teacher training \nprogramme in relation to teaching in general and teaching music in particular. 341 \nstudents from four higher education institutions in the UK completed a short \nquestionnaire. While almost all teachers had confidence in their ability to teach only \nabout half were confident about teaching music. There were statistically significant \ndifferences in response depending on whether the students played one or more \nmusical instruments. Instrumentalists were more confident, those playing more than \none instrument exhibiting the highest levels. Most students believed that more time \nshould be spent on training, although they praised its quality. The implications of the \nfindings are discussed and alternative ways of addressing the problem are considered.   \n 3 \nTrainee primary school teachers\u2019 perceptions of their effectiveness in \nteaching music \n \nIntroduction \n \nIn the United Kingdom (UK) during the early 1990s, it was acknowledged that many \nprimary teachers felt ill equipped and insecure at the prospect of having to teach \nmusic and that very few teachers in primary schools had any qualifications in music, \neven at a comparatively modest level. A range of reports identified the need for \nadditional in-service training and more input to initial teacher training, as well as an \nincrease in the provision of music specialists and music-consultancy schemes to \nsupport less confident primary teachers. Since then, there is evidence from a number \nof sources that there has been a gradual improvement in the quality of music provision \nin primary schools (QCA, 2005; Ofsted, 2005). The latest annual report of the Office \nfor Standards in Education (Ofsted, 2005) stated that the achievement of pupils in \nmusic in primary schools was good or better in around three fifths of schools and that \nthe quality of teaching was good or better in nearly three quarters of schools. \nHowever, accommodation for music was good or better in less than 50% of schools \nwhile the leadership and management of music was good or better in just over 50% of \nschools. In relation to teacher training, the need for training providers to satisfy \nrigorous criteria set out by the Teacher Development Agency in terms of the \ncurriculum and the amount of time that trainees have to spend in school has limited \nthe opportunities for trainees to engage in musical training, while in their school \nplacements opportunities will depend on the extent to which music is valued in the \nschool, available resources and the quality of support on offer from teachers.   \n 4 \n \nProgress in engendering change has been slow because schools have prioritised other \nareas of the curriculum in response to a wide range of government initiatives which \nhave had a focus on literacy and numeracy. As a result, in terms of whole-school \ncurriculum development, music has remained a low priority. Only 5% of schools \nmade music the main subject focus in 2004\/05 and just 3% of schools were making \nmusic the main subject focus for developing the curriculum in 2005\/06 (QCA, 2005). \nThose schools which made the most improvement were those which exhibited clear \nleadership with priorities set for curriculum and staff development; where there was \ngood quality information at transfer from Key Stage 1 (Years 1and 2) into Key Stage \n2 (Years 3-6); where there was careful consideration of the ways that time for music \nwas allocated and used; where attention was given to the teaching of music-specific \nskills, using experienced staff with expertise to support whole-school or key stage \ndevelopments; and where available use was made of Local Authority Music Services \n(these provide instrumental lessons and a range of extra-curricular activities) to \nsupport the music curriculum. In some cases, this led to in-school support for subject \nleaders or class teachers; in others, there were cluster or pyramid arrangements to \nshare developing practice (QCA, 2005).  \nThe new UK primary strategy, Excellence and Enjoyment (2003) which extends the \nprovision beyond the statutory entitlement for music provided by the National \nCurriculum to include instrumental, vocal taster and foundation sessions for all pupils, \nfollowed by a period of free or low-cost instrumental tuition in small and larger \nensemble groups is being piloted under the Wider Opportunities initiative. This \ninitiative has provided opportunities for school staff to develop their musical skills \nalongside specialist music teachers. This type of training, through classroom support, \n 5 \nis most favoured by teachers (Beauchamp, 1997; Holden and Button, 2006). Despite \nthese developments there continue to be many schools where the potential benefits of \nmusic education are not being realised. Many class teachers need support if pupils are \nto reach the standards expected of them at the end of Key Stage 2 (aged 11) (Ofsted, \n2005; Holden and Button, 2006). Music has been found to be one of the most difficult \nfoundation subjects to cover at Key Stages 1 and 2 (QCA, 2005). Teachers lack \nconfidence in teaching music particularly if they are non-specialists (Hargreaves et al. \n(2002) and there is an urgent need for continuing professional development or better \ninitial training to address specific musical skills and musical vocabulary.  \nAn alternative to developing the skills of existing teachers is to employ specialist \nmusic teachers to teach the music curriculum. There has been a long-standing debate \nas to whether primary school music is best taught by music specialists or non-\nspecialist class teachers (Wheway, 2006; Hennessy, 2006). Mills (1989) warned \nagainst the overuse of specialists suggesting that \u2018having a special teacher for music \ndoes not necessarily improve its image\u2019. She suggested that children valued the \nsubject less if it was not taught by their own class teacher as part of their whole \ncurriculum and suggested that \u2018generalist teaching allows greater opportunity for \nmusic to take place as the need arises\u2026 because a class teacher has knowledge of \nindividual children which a visiting specialist teacher cannot hope to match. A class \nteacher can use a child\u2019s success in music as a catalyst for progress elsewhere\u2019 \n(p.127). While this might be an ideal it is often not attained in practice. Hennessy \n(2006) argues that \u2018where a school values music and has had the foresight (or luck) to \nappoint teachers with confidence in their abilities to teach music then the musical life \nof the school is healthy, permeates the whole community and sits alongside and \nwithin other subject areas as a full member of the curriculum\u2019. She goes on to point \n 6 \nout that \u2018in many schools, if there is no champion for music on the permanent staff \nmuch of the fundamental provision and the access to enrichment are compromised.\u2019 \n(p. 23). Given that there are insufficient primary music specialists this may be a \ncommonplace situation (Miliband, 2004). Thomas (1997) suggests that the situation is \nexacerbated because the 1995 National Curriculum does not explain how to develop \nchildren\u2019s musical skills and understanding in a systematic way. While a music \nspecialist may be able to interpret the National Curriculum requirements the generalist \nclass teacher may feel that they cannot contribute usefully to the skill and knowledge \ndevelopment which is essential if children are to move systematically through their \nmusical education. \n \nWill the current situation improve as newly qualified teachers enter the profession? \nThe standards for teacher training in the UK require \u2018newly qualified teachers to be \nconfident and authoritative in the subjects that they teach and to have a clear \nunderstanding of how all pupils should progress and what teachers should expect \nthem to achieve.\u2019 Trainees must demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the \ncurriculum for each of the National Curriculum core subjects, the frameworks, \nmethods and expectations set out in the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategies \nand have sufficient understanding of a range of work across the following subjects: \nHistory or Geography; Physical Education; ICT; Art and Design or Design and \nTechnology; Performing Arts; and Religious Education to be able to teach them in the \nage range for which they are trained with advice from an experienced colleague where \nnecessary (TDA, 2002). As music is not mentioned specifically, only under the \numbrella of the performing arts, it is possible that trainee teachers may have no direct \nexperience in teaching music. Further, as Hennessy (2006) points out, music in \n 7 \nprimary training is not only disadvantaged by having little time in the curriculum but \nalso because there may be little or no access to experience of it in teaching practice \n(Hennessy, 2006). In the light of this the aim of this research was to explore: \n- the levels of confidence of students completing their one-year Post Graduate \nCertificate in Education (PGCE) course in teaching music in comparison with \nteaching in general; \n- their views as to whether music should be taught by specialists; \n- whether they felt that the amount of training was sufficient to be effective in \nteaching music; \n- what additional input, if any, they would like in their course.     \n \nMethod \n \nFour Higher Education institutions participated in the research. They were selected on \nthe basis of their locations in different parts of the country, in rural, urban and inner \ncity areas and to represent students studying full and part time. Each Institution \napproached the inclusion of music in the primary teacher training curriculum in a \nslightly different way.  In one institution all trainees had 3 hours of specific music \ntuition with music input in cross curricular themes and drama sessions. A music \nspecialism was also offered with 8 days of face to face teaching and additional work \nrequired in schools. Another institution provided trainees with 4.5 hours of specific \nmusic training with additional input through cross curricular themes. In one of the \nremaining institutions students spent 9 hours training to teach music, in the other 12 \nhours.  \n  \n 8 \nTrainee teachers on primary PGCE programmes in the four higher education \ninstitutions were asked to complete a short questionnaire which related to their \nconfidence in teaching music. They were asked to indicate the area of their first \ndegree, provide information about their musical expertise, and complete a rating scale \nindicating their confidence in relation to a variety of teaching activities. They were \nalso asked some open questions about the level of training that they had received to \nprepare them for teaching music to their class, whether they felt that this was \nadequate, and what other elements of musical training, if any, they would have liked \nto have been available. The questionnaires were completed as the trainees came to the \nend of their courses.    \n \nThe response rate from the four institutions differed in part because of the way that \nthe questionnaires were distributed. Where it was possible for the students to \ncomplete them face-to-face there was a greater response. Where students were asked \nto complete the questionnaire over e-mail the responses were fewer. (Table 1 gives \ndetails)  \n \nTable 1 about here \n \nFindings \n \nThe students had a wide range of different first degrees. The largest groups were \nsocial science (24%) and humanities graduates (20.5%) (see Table 2 for details). \n \n 9 \nTable 2 about here \n \nInstruments played \n  \nThe students were asked about the extent of their musical experience. For 23 students \n(7%) music was included in their first degree. 95 students (28% reported playing a \nkeyboard instrument. 34 students (10%) reported playing a stringed instrument. 29 \nreported that they played the guitar (9%). 10 played percussion instruments (3%), 84 \nplayed a woodwind instrument (25%), 8 played brass instruments (2%), 15 reported \nthat they were vocalists (4%). 56% did not play an instrument (see Table 3).  \n \nTable 3 about here \n \nConfidence in teaching and in teaching music \n \nThe majority of teachers agreed that they would be an effective teacher (87%) and \nthat they were confident about their teaching (91%). In contrast only 47% agreed that \nthey were confident about teaching music to their class, 50% that they could sing well \nenough to teach music to their class, 55% that they could read music, 36% that they \ncould play an instrument well enough to use in lessons. Despite this 72% believed that \nthey would enjoy teaching music to their class and 62% stated that they liked teaching \nmusic. 55% thought that specialist music teachers should teach music in primary \nschools (see Figure 1 and Table 4 for full details).  \n \n 10 \nTable 4  and Figure 1 about here \n      \n \nRelationship of confidence to playing a musical instrument  \n \n56% of the sample (192) reported not playing an instrument. There were statistically \nsignificant differences in response to all of the statements relative to whether the \nstudents played a musical instrument or not. In all cases the instrumentalists were \nmore confident, even to statements not directly related to teaching music (see Table 5 \nand Figures 2 and 3 for details).  \n \nTable 5 and Figures 2 and 3 about here \n \nRelationship of confidence to musical expertise  \n  \nFurther analysis was undertaken to establish how many instruments each student \nplayed. 192 students did not play an instrument (56%). 57 students (17%) played one \ninstrument, while 92 students (27%) played two or more instruments. The responses \nto the questionnaires were analysed in relation to level of musical expertise. There \nwere statistically significant differences in relation to all of the statements except \nbeing generally confident about teaching. The greater the level of musical expertise \nthe more confident that the teachers were in relation to all aspects of teaching music \nand being effective teachers overall. In relation to whether specialist teachers should \nteach music the trend was reversed. The higher the level of musical expertise the \ngreater the disagreement that specialist teachers should teach music (see Table 6 and \nFigures 4 and 5).  \n 11 \n \nTable 6 and Figures 4 and 5 about here \n \nAttitudes towards the teaching of music by specialist teachers \n \nFurther more detailed examination of the data revealed that while there is broad \nagreement from those who have relatively little musical expertise that music should \nbe taught by specialist teachers (75.5%) there is less agreement amongst those who \nplay one or more instruments. 56.2% of those who played one instrument agree that \nmusic should be taught by specialist teachers, while 29.8% indicated that they didn\u2019t \nknow. Of those playing more than one instrument 46.7% agreed that specialist \nteachers should teach music, while 35.8% disagreed. 16.3% indicated that they didn\u2019t \nknow.   \n \nTable 7 about here \n \nThe qualitative responses to the open questions in the questionnaire provided insights \ninto why teachers believed that specialist teachers should teach music. Some believed \nthat it would provide a better education for the children:  \n \n\u2018I think it would be a good idea for specialist music teachers to take some music \nlessons in primary schools because they have a real enthusiasm for the subject and \nwill therefore encourage children to enjoy music too. It will also enable children to \nexperience a wider variety of music that the normal primary teacher probably cannot \noffer.\u2019 \n 12 \n \nOne student expressed relief that a specialist was going to be teaching music:  \n \n\u2018Music is clearly my weakest area so am delighted that peripatetic teacher will be \nproviding PPA in new job!\u2019 \n \nSome students indicated that they did not want specialists teaching music but that the \nextent of training on offer needed to be enhanced to enable non-specialists to teach it \nwell.  \n \n\u2018Our music training was excellent compared with the training we received for some \nother foundation subjects. However, I feel that music is an area where extra support is \nneeded for those who aren\u2019t specialists, especially those who have no experience of \nreading music. Despite this, I do not think that only music specialists should teach \nmusic in primary schools. Some children respond well to the fact that others are not so \nconfident, and are more inclined to try things out as a result.\u2019 \n \n\u2018I think all primary school teachers should be trained well enough to make specialist \nmusic teachers unnecessary.\u2019 \n \nOne student commented on the need for more in-service training for teachers also \nsuggesting that if people felt unconfident and did not like teaching music it would be \nbetter if specialists took on the task: \n \n 13 \n\u2018I think teachers need to be given more in service training with regard to teaching \nmusic. I have found that it is often neglected in the curriculum as people are unsure of \nhow to teach it. I enjoy teaching music and would not want a specialist teacher to \nteach all my music lessons although it would be useful to team teach in order to \nfurther my learning and knowledge of this subject area. However, I think that for the \nchildren whose teachers do not like teaching music, it would be beneficial to have \nlessons taught by a specialist.\u2019 \n \nSeveral students indicated that they realised the importance of music and were going \nto develop their own skills:  \n \n\u2018I didn\u2019t realise the importance of music for children until my final placement \u2013 \nchildren respond so well to music that I am going to learn to play the guitar.\u2019 \n \n\u2018I think it\u2019s good to have specialist music teachers in school but teachers like me who \nwant to build on their music teaching skills should be able to do so. I intend to \npractice my piano playing so I could use it in school.\u2019 \n \n\u2018I know I am weak in the area of music and have recently purchased a piano to learn \nhow to play.\u2019 \n \nSeveral students indicated that there should be flexibility so that teachers who felt that \nthey lacked sufficient skills need not teach music.  \n \n 14 \n\u2018Specialist music teachers should be used where staff feel unable to teach music \nadequately. However, where teachers wish to teach music to their class they should be \nable to.\u2019 \n \n\u2018It\u2019s perhaps a subject that teachers could be given the option to teach \u2013 e.g. I would \nquite happily swap teaching art and teach music to other classes.\u2019 \n \nOne student observed that where teachers lacked confidence in teaching music it was \noften given less attention in the curriculum: \n \n\u2018I strongly believe in the values of teaching music in schools, but found it was an area \nwhich was sacrificed if other activities were planned (e.g. school trips, external \nvisitors). I also found many teachers are not confident teaching music. However I was \nencouraged to find that this was an area that was being rectified.\u2019 \n \nPerceptions of sufficiency of amount of training \n \nEighty one students (33% of those responding to this question) indicated that they had \nspent no time being trained to teach music. Other responses ranged from 0.3 to 81 \nhours. The wide range is because a small number of students were taking music as \ntheir specialist option, while others taking other options did not take music (see Figure \n7).  \n \nFigure 7 about here \n \n 15 \nSufficiency of training \n \nOut of 330 students who responded to a Yes\/No question regarding whether training \nwas sufficient 256 (78%) indicated that it was not. 59 (18%) felt that it was. Other \nresponses indicated that the question was not applicable or they did not know. 11 \nstudents (3%) indicated that they were taking a music specialization stream. In the \nopen questions 219 (65%) were very complimentary regarding the quality of the \ntraining that they received but indicated that more training was needed: \n \n\u2018I think it is a general problem with the PGCE that there isn\u2019t enough time to cover \nthe foundation subjects in enough detail for people to feel confident in the subject. \nOur music tutor at the university was fantastic \u2013 there just wasn\u2019t enough time to fit in \neverything we need to know.\u2019 \n \n\u2018I thought that our music teacher at University was superb. We all enjoyed our lessons \nand felt inspired, but I just felt that there wasn\u2019t enough time dedicated to music (or \nother foundation subjects).\u2019 \n \n\u2018One day to cover all aspects of music teaching is not enough. It gave me some good \nactivity ideas but not enough confidence to convince me I\u2019d be able to teach. \nConfidence has to come from direct teaching experience in schools.\u2019 \n \n\u2018Choosing drama meant that I only had a taster session for music which, although \nvery good, was not really sufficient. I have had no input concerning schemes of work \nor expectations.\u2019 \n 16 \n \nSome students who had considerable experience were happy with the amount of \ntraining but acknowledged that it would have been insufficient for others:  \n \n\u2018It was sufficient for me because I was of a very high standard and I have a lot of \nmusical experience. As a result I felt prepared at the end of it. However someone with \nlittle musical experience probably would still feel uncertain with only 12 hours \ntuition, no matter what the standard of it.\u2019 \n \n\u2018It is very specialised, if you don\u2019t understand music it is not sufficient. I did \u2018O\u2019 level \nmusic so felt fine others on the course were not so advantaged.\u2019 \n \nSome who had already had musical training felt that the amount of time dedicated to \nmusic was insufficient:  \n \n\u2018Even as someone who has had musical training, teaching music is so specialized that \nI still feel I could have learnt so much more. More importantly, those with little\/no \nconfidence have only had one day training! Will they be effective music teachers?\u2019 \n \nStudents who because of option choices had had no training were critical: \n \n\u2018I think it is unacceptable that we are going into our first year teaching without any \ntraining in music. It\u2019s the same with history and drama.\u2019 \n \n\u2018 I received none and I feel this is a sham. I think that the foundation and creative \nsubjects have been badly neglected on the course. Developing knowledge and skills in \n 17 \nthese subjects can be just as beneficial as learning to read and write for some \nchildren.\u2019 \n \nResponses to the statement about the sufficiency of training were analysed in relation \nto the level of expertise of the students. Among the non-players only 7.6% (13) felt \nthat the amount of training was adequate 92.4% (157) indicated that it was not. Of \nthose playing one instrument 23.6% felt that the training was sufficient (13), 76.4% \ndid not (55). Of those playing two or more instruments 36.7% indicated that the \ntraining was sufficient, 63,3% did not. This was despite the fact that the quality of the \ntraining was praised. \n \nReasons given for needing more training  \n \nStudents referred to the fact that without prior musical training it was difficult to \ndevelop skills and knowledge independently:  \n \n\u2018Music isn\u2019t a subject you can research in the same way you can with other subjects \nso I wanted more teaching.\u2019 \n \nSome students referred to issues of equal opportunities for the children: \n \n\u2018Having not done music since Year 9 (secondary school). I feel it was not fair on the \nfuture children we will be teaching to only allow us half the subjects on this course to \nbe done in any depth \u2013 I feel wholly unprepared.\u2019 \n \n 18 \nThe qualitative responses supported the quantitative data in indicating the lack of \nconfidence of some students:   \n \n\u2018The training has given me the basics of how to approach teaching music and at the \ntime was enthusing and encouraging. But I am not particularly musical and didn\u2019t put \nthe theory and ideas into practice very much in my placements so I still feel reticent \nabout teaching music.\u2019 \n \n\u2018I have limited musical ability and don\u2019t really feel prepared for teaching the subject. \nWhen I am teaching music I don\u2019t feel that I understand the progression in the subject. \nMusic is the subject that I feel the least qualified to teach.\u2019 \n \nWhat students would like to be offered during training \n \nStudents were asked to make suggestions for what they would like to see included in \ntheir training. Table 8 sets out the details. Of those responding 32% requested more \nlesson ideas, 20% more activities to undertake, 19% singing training, 16% \ninformation about progression, 14% teaching reading music and theory, 11% more \nconsideration of resources, 10% more experience in the implementation of ideas, 10% \nmore ideas for assessment and information about the curriculum, 10% training in \nplaying instruments, 7% basic information about rhythm and tempo, 2% knowledge \nabout music technology, and 1% composing.   \n \nTable 8 about here \n \n       \n 19 \nDiscussion \n \nThe findings suggest that many primary school teachers entering the teaching \nprofession in England feel that the amount of training that they have received in \nrelation to teaching music has been inadequate although the quality of that training is \nhigh. This is a matter for concern, particularly as in Australia, the level of initial \nteacher training has been found to be the strongest determinant of the level of music \neducation generalists provide (Temmerman, 1997) and affects teachers\u2019 ability to \nteach music adequately (Darling-Hammond, 2001).  \n \nThe trainee teachers participating in the current research reported a lack confidence in \nteaching music in comparison with teaching in general. Teacher confidence is also an \nimportant determinant of the extent to which music is taught in the classroom (Mills, \n1989; Gifford, 1993; Bresler; 1993; Russell-Bowie 1993, 2002) and the quality of that  \nteaching (Byo, 2000). There is evidence that where specialist teachers are not \navailable little music tends to be taught and there is little attention to the development \nof musical skills (Stake et al., 1991). This has implications for the delivery of the \nNational Curriculum in music in primary schools in England and for the opportunities \nwhich children have to experience music education. As Temmerman (1991) has \nargued the successful translation of curriculum statements into practice depends on \nthe skills, knowledge and confidence of the teacher. There are a number of options for \naddressing this issue.  \n \nOne option would be to increase the amount of training included in one-year Post \nGraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) courses. This would ensure that everyone \n 20 \nhad at least some expertise for teaching music on completing initial training, and that \nspecialists and non-specialists had a range of available resources, materials and \nstrategies. It would also enable teachers to develop a more thorough knowledge of the \nrequirements of the National Curriculum in music. The difficulties with this approach \nare that the teacher training curriculum is already overloaded and that an increase in \ntraining to teach music would reduce the time available for training in other subjects. \nIt would also increase pressure for more time to be allocated to training in all of the \nnon-core subjects. It may be that in the 21\nst\n century it is unrealistic to expect the \ngeneralist primary teacher to manage the complexity and volume of the entire \ncurriculum. There is certainly evidence from the USA that generalists do not always \ntreat music as a serious element of the curriculum allowing it become a vehicle for \nentertainment, and supporting school productions and school traditions (Bresler, \n1993).  \n \nAn alternative to increasing the time in initial training would be to make available \nmore Continuing Professional Development (CPD) opportunities for existing \nteachers. This would increase the musical expertise in schools nationwide and \nenhance existing provision of music in the National Curriculum. It would encourage \nteachers to collectively take responsibility for engagement in music teaching and to \nwork in a collegial fashion within the school. There is evidence that it can be \nsuccessful (Hallam et al., 2005) but it requires considerable investment of teacher \ntime and to date schools have been reluctant to prioritise music above other subjects. \nIt also places responsibility for ensuring that training takes place with individual \nteachers and head teachers. A related option is to explore how music can be taught \n 21 \nthrough technology. This would also require training for teachers but the nature of this \ntraining might be less demanding musically.     \n \nClosely related to this are initiatives which develop teacher skills through \ncollaborative work with specialist teachers. Teachers favour this system (Beauchamp, \n1997) and there is evidence that it can be effective (Gamble, 1998). One approach is \nto have a specialist teacher within each school who works with generalist teachers \nthrough apprenticeship and mentoring processes  (Plummeridge, 1991, Askew, 1993). \nThere is joint planning, sharing of ideas and resources, and the development of a \nprogramme of work. An alternative is to have advisory teachers who work across a \nrange of schools providing teachers with ongoing support (Hinson et al., 1989). A \nrecent development in England is the wider opportunities programme for providing \nfirst access for pupils at Key Stage 2 (KS2) (age 7-11) to an experience of \ninstrumental tuition in a classroom context. This has been shown to have a positive \nimpact on teaching and learning in music at KS2. It provides a model for school and \nmusic services partnership work and the use of instrumental teachers in delivering the \ncurriculum. There are some indications from head teachers that there is a positive \nimpact where the Wider Opportunities model is being used on pupils\u2019 learning across \nthe curriculum. Such collaborative working serves to develop the skills of specialist \nand generalist teachers (Ofsted, 2004). However, it is costly to have two teachers \nteaching simultaneously and expertise developed in this way is lost as staff move \nbetween schools, although this also applies to other CPD initiatives.  \n \nAnother option is to use specialist teachers to teach music in primary schools \nparticularly as children progress through KS2. As Plummeridge (1991) has argued, \n 22 \nteachers must be an authority in their subject for children to develop musical skills to \nthe highest level. Specialist teaching provides a high level of subject knowledge, \ncommitment, professionalism, enthusiasm for the subject and can have a positive \nimpact on the work of other teachers (Colley, 1991; Ofsted, 1997). Specialists are also \nable to act as advocates for the subject (Ofsted, 1997). Specialists might be employed \nas teachers in the school or be peripatetic specialist primary music teachers employed \nby the Local Authority Music Service to teach music in a number of schools. \nSpecialist teaching ensures that all children have access to high quality music \nteaching, and enables children to become accustomed to the notion that different \nteachers might teach different subjects in preparation for secondary school. It does, \nhowever, indicate that music is \u2018special\u2019 and can isolate it from the rest of the \ncurriculum (Askew, 1991). Where specialist teachers are employed by the school \nthere is the danger that they will move on and that the school will have no provision. \n \nWhere visiting specialists come in from outside the school there is the danger that \nthey will be seen as the providers of release time for generalists (Colley, 1991). In \naddition, visiting specialists cannot integrate every music lesson into the wider \ncurriculum of every class that they teach (Hoffer and  Hoffer, 1987) and this creates \nproblems for adopting an integrated view of the arts within the wider school \ncurriculum (Glover and Young, 1999; Smith, 1992; Livermore, 1998; Livermore and \nMcPherson, 1998, Glover and Ward, 1993, McPherson and Dunbar-Hall, 2001). They \nalso have less knowledge of individual children than the class teacher (Mills, 1993) \nand are unable to teach music as frequently as the class teacher (Mills, 1989,1993), \nalthough this has to be balanced against evidence that teachers with little musical \nexperience are less likely to incorporate music into their everyday teaching (Verastro \n 23 \nand Leglar, 1992). Employing visiting specialists sends a message to schools that they \ndo not need to train their teachers to teach music, and de-skills generalist teachers. \nThere is also the ongoing difficulty that there are insufficient trained music teachers. \n \nIn conclusion, we need as a matter of urgency to develop strategies for enabling music \nwithin the UK National Curriculum to be taught effectively in primary schools, to \nempower teachers so that they feel confident to successfully and effectively teach \nmusic and be receptive to new ideas. This may include developing the use of new \ntechnologies, increasing working across the creative arts, or making greater use of \nspecialists to teach and\/or train teachers. Children have a right to a high quality music \neducation. The systems that have been in place over a number of years have failed to \ndeliver this equitably. The various government and regulatory bodies and the teaching \nprofession have a responsibility to ensure that every child has the opportunity to \naccess a high quality experience to the National Curriculum in music wherever they \nattend school. Whatever approaches are adopted, action needs to be taken speedily to \nensure that this happens.    \n \nReferences \nAskew, G. (1993) Music education in the primary school.
