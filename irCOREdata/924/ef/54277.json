Predicting river water quality across North West England \n \n 2 \nAbstract 1 \nLinear relationships between regional water quality and catchment characteristics (terrain, 2 \nland cover, geology, base flow index and rainfall) are examined for rivers in North West 3 \nEngland using a GIS-based approach and an extensive Environment Agency water quality 4 \ndatabase. The study considers the role of diffuse and distal point sources on river water 5 \nquality. The results show that base cation concentrations are strongly linked to catchment 6 \nterrain and land cover, while pH is linked to bedrock geology and land cover. Mean nitrate 7 \nconcentrations are most strongly related to arable cover, although distal point sources in urban 8 \nand rural catchments appear to have a significant effect on river nitrate concentrations in the 9 \nregion. Orthophosphate and suspended sediment concentrations are most closely related to the 10 \npercentage urban development. Linear models are tested on a large independent water quality 11 \ndataset, resulting in maps showing predicted water quality across the region. The approach 12 \nworks well for the prediction of nitrate concentrations and other constituents which have 13 \npredominantly diffuse sources. In contrast, the linear approach to predicting orthophosphate 14 \nconcentrations in North West rivers using catchment characteristics is problematic. The major 15 \ninfluence of point sources may mask the effect of wider basin attributes on orthophosphate 16 \nconcentrations. Within-river processing of phosphorus may also explain why the relationship 17 \nbreaks down. Further work is needed to explain phosphorus contributions and variability in 18 \nNorth West rivers, especially in the context of effective catchment management.   19 \n 20 \nKey words: Rivers; Nitrate; Phosphate; Base cations; pH; Sediments; Modelling; GIS 21 \n 22 \n 23 \n 24 \n 25 \n  \nRothwell et al.  Predicting river water quality across North West England \n \n 3 \n1. Introduction 1 \nExcessive inputs of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) to fluvial systems can lead to adverse 2 \nbiological effects including algal growth and changes in ecosystem function and diversity 3 \n(Mason, 1996; Carpenter et al., 1998; Mainstone and Parr, 2002; Withers and Lord, 2002). 4 \nHigh loadings of fine sediment to rivers and the subsequent accumulation on the channel bed 5 \ncan impact fish and invertebrates which rely on benthic habitats (Heany et al., 2001; 6 \nMainstone et al., 2008). Runoff from agricultural land and effluents from urban and industrial 7 \nareas are major sources of nutrients and fine sediment in river systems (Vitousek et al., 1997; 8 \nHart et al., 2004; Jarvie et al., 2006; Ulen et al., 2007; Edwards and Withers, 2008; Neal et al. 9 \n2010). The relative contributions from these diverse sources can vary significantly in space 10 \n(e.g. Nedwell et al., 2002; Neal et al., 2008; Mainstone et al., 2008; White and Hammond, 11 \n2009) and in time (e.g. Stutter et al., 2008; Bowes et al., 2009).  12 \n 13 \nThe importance of water quality deterioration due to enhanced nutrient and contaminant 14 \ninputs, and the need for effective targeting of mitigation approaches and river catchment 15 \nmanagement, has led to the development of a variety of water quality models. Several broad 16 \ntypes of models exist depending upon requirements such as the spatial and temporal scale of 17 \napplication (Johnes and Heathwaite, 1997). Process-based nutrient export models, such as 18 \nINCA (Integrated Nitrogen in Catchments; Whitehead et al., 1998), PSYCHIC (Phosphorus 19 \nand Sediment Yield Characterisation In Catchments; Davidson et al., 2008; Stromqvist et al., 20 \n2008) and SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool; Arnold et al., 1998) are useful for 21 \nretrospective evaluation and scenario analysis, but often need detailed parameterisation and 22 \nextensive calibration (Merritt et al., 2003; Cherry et al., 2008). An alternative to these often 23 \ncomplex models are simple \u201eblack box\u201f empirical approaches, such as those based on nutrient 24 \nexport coefficients (Johnes, 1996; Jordan and Smith, 2005) and PIT (Phosphorus Indicators 25 \n  \nRothwell et al.  Predicting river water quality across North West England \n \n 4 \nTool; Heathwaite et al., 2003). These models can be particularly useful for large-scale 1 \nextrapolation, and for exploring how future changes in land use and\/or fertiliser application 2 \nmay impact river water quality (e.g. Johnes et al., 2007). However, since they operate by 3 \napplying an empirically-derived export value to each hypothesised source they do not lend 4 \nthemselves to new inferences about potential processes. 5 \n 6 \nA hybrid of these two approaches links river water quality to catchment characteristics or 7 \nattributes, and employs statistical techniques for up-scaling. These models can shed light on 8 \npotentially important drivers via the catchment characteristics incorporated in the model, but 9 \nsince they do not include complex and heterogeneous processes they can be applied over large 10 \nspatial areas (Wade et al., 2004; Cherry et al., 2008). Developing water quality models based 11 \non the percentage surface area of a catchment covered by a particular characteristic was 12 \ntraditionally undertaken using mapping techniques (e.g. Lynch and Dise, 1985), but with the 13 \nadvent of GIS, the approach is much faster and has seen considerable development in recent 14 \nyears. GIS-regression based approaches have been used to explore controls on the 15 \ndistributions of riverine nutrient and sediment concentrations across varied geographical 16 \nregions (e.g. Smith et al., 1997; Clark et al., 2004; Donohue et al. 2005; 2006; van de Perk et 17 \nal., 2007; Siakeu et al., 2004; Davies and Neal, 2004; 2007; Helliwell et al., 2007; Alexander 18 \net al., 2008). It has also been used to investigate controls on surface water acidification (e.g. 19 \nHornung et al., 1995; Thornton and Dise, 1998; Vuoeuema and Forsius, 2008) and linkages 20 \nbetween river metal and sediment levels and catchment attributes (e.g. Jarvie et al., 2002; 21 \nSaikau et al., 2004). Although the GIS-regression approach has been widely used for 22 \nproducing statistical models of water quality, fewer studies have used the approach to 23 \ngenerate spatial predictions of water quality at unmonitored points along the river network, 24 \nespecially in regions with mixed catchment settings. A variety of important legislative drivers 25 \n  \nRothwell et al.  Predicting river water quality across North West England \n \n 5 \nhave been introduced to help mitigate surface water pollution, primarily the European Water 1 \nFramework Directive (WFD) (European Parliament, 2000). Simple GIS-based statistical 2 \nmodels of river water quality and associated spatial predictions are potentially highly useful 3 \nfor identifying river reaches at risk of failing to meet environmental objectives set by such 4 \nlegislation. This approach may provide a useful complement or alternative to those process-5 \nbased models currently in use for informing decisions regarding the targeting of measures to 6 \nreduce river pollution. 7 \n 8 \nThis paper explores empirical relationships between river water quality and a suite of 9 \ncatchment characteristics in North West England. This region is characterised by a wide range 10 \nof land uses and catchment settings. It represents a mix from the urban heartlands of the 11 \nindustrial North West to upland rural areas of outstanding natural beauty, and consequently 12 \nthere is considerable variability in water quality. Within a GIS framework, linear relationships 13 \nare used to predict river water pH and the concentrations of calcium, magnesium, nitrate-N, 14 \northophosphate-P and suspended solids across the North West. Model outputs are validated 15 \nusing a large independent dataset. The aims of the study are to (1) identify broad-scale 16 \ncontrols on river water quality, (2) provide insights into the relative importance of diffuse and 17 \ndistal point sources for chemical constituents of water quality, and (3) investigate the utility of 18 \nGIS-regression based approaches for predicting river water quality in the North West. 19 \n 20 \n2. Study area 21 \nNorth West England (Figure 1) is typified by the industrial cities of Manchester and Liverpool; 22 \nthe heartland of the 19\nth\n century English Industrial Revolution. Although these urban and 23 \nhighly populated areas dominate large portions of the south of the region, large parts of the 24 \nNorth West are rural. These include The Lake District located in Cumbria (Britain\u201fs largest 25 \n  \nRothwell et al.  Predicting river water quality across North West England \n \n 6 \nnational park), the Forest of Bowland in Lancashire, the Pennine fringe to the east of the 1 \nregion, and intensive agricultural areas on the North West coast. Much of the bedrock geology 2 \nis characterised by a variety of Carboniferous and Permian-Triassic sedimentary rocks. An 3 \nexception to this is the Lower Palaeozoic metamorphic and volcanic rocks in the uplands of 4 \nThe Lake District. Steep slopes are typical of this upland region. Major rivers in the North 5 \nWest include the Irwell and Mersey in Greater Manchester, the Lune, Ribble and Wyre in 6 \nLancashire and the Eden and Duddon in Cumbria (Figure 1). These rivers provide major 7 \nfreshwater inputs to the Irish Sea. 8 \n 9 \n3. Methods 10 \n3.1. Water quality data 11 \nCalcium (Ca\n2+\n); magnesium (Mg\n2+\n); nitrate (NO3\n\u2013\n-N); orthophosphate (PO4\n3-\n-P); and 12 \nsuspended solid (SS) concentrations, together with pH measurements, were acquired using 13 \ndatabases of the Environment Agency (EA) of England and Wales. The EA sample rivers and 14 \nstreams at monthly intervals. Further details of the methods used by the EA are described by 15 \nNeal et al. (1999). River monitoring data from the EA\u201fs routine monitoring programme for 16 \nthe period 1995 to 2001 were used in the study. This period was selected to ensure 17 \nharmonisation with spatial datasets and to ensure that the monitoring period was the same 18 \nacross the North West region. Monitoring sites were only selected where more than 60 19 \nreadings were available for each determinand. Point sources (e.g. effluents from waste water 20 \ntreatment works) can have a major effect on river water chemistry at sites in close proximity 21 \nto these inputs (Neal et al., 2008). At these locations there is potential for these inputs to mask 22 \nrelationships between river water chemistry and basin-wide attributes (Davies and Neal, 23 \n2004). Therefore, monitoring stations located immediately downstream (within 500m) of 24 \nEnvironment Agency consent to discharge sites (i.e. known point sources on the river network) 25 \n  \nRothwell et al.  Predicting river water quality across North West England \n \n 7 \nwere not included in the selection. Catchments with a strong urban-industrial base and a high 1 \nnumber of point sources were still included in the analysis, but these distal point sources are 2 \ndiffuse in nature (\u201ediffuse-point\u201f, c.f. Neal et al., 2004; 2008). From approximately 1500 EA 3 \nmonitoring sites across the North West region, the number of sites for each determinand that 4 \nmet the criteria was: 318 (Ca\n2+\n), 264 (Mg\n2+\n), 530 (NO3\n\u2013\n-N), 566 (PO4\n3-\n-P), 562 (SS) and 620 5 \n(pH) (Figure 1). The sites used in the analysis cover a wide range of catchment sizes, land 6 \nuses, geology, rainfall, and water quality. For each of the determinands the arithmetic mean 7 \nwas calculated. 8 \n 9 \n3.2. Spatial datasets 10 \nThis study uses five spatial datasets. A description of each is provided below. 11 \n 12 \n3.2.1. Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) Wallingford Digital Terrain Model (DTM). 13 \nAvailable as a 50 m (horizontal) and 0.1 m (vertical) resolution grid (Morris and Flavin, 14 \n1990).  15 \n 16 \n3.2.2. Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) Land Cover Map 2000 (LCM2000). 17 \nAvailable as a 25 m UK-wide grid. There are 26 land cover classes available in the LCM2000. 18 \nThese were aggregated into 12 new classes: Arable, Acid grassland, Bracken, Calcareous 19 \ngrassland, Exposed rock, Heathland, Improved grassland, Neutral grassland, Urban, Water, 20 \nWetland and Woodland.   21 \n 22 \n3.2.3. British Geological Survey (BGS) Bedrock Geology. Available as 1:625,000 scale data 23 \nvia the British Geological Survey Digital Geological Map of Great Britain (DiGMapGB). The 24 \nlarge number of bedrock classes were aggregated to form 8 new bedrock classes: coal 25 \n  \nRothwell et al.  Predicting river water quality across North West England \n \n 8 \nmeasures, conglomerates, granites and lavas, limestones, shales, siltstones, sandstones and 1 \nshales, and sandstones and mudstones. 2 \n 3 \n3.2.4. Base Flow Index (BFI). Available as a 1 km UK-wide grid of BFI values. BFI values 4 \nrange between 0 and 1 and indicate the ratio of base flow to total flow volume (Gustard et al., 5 \n1992). 6 \n 7 \n3.2.5. Met Office Standard Annual Average Rainfall (SAAR). Available as a 1 km grid 8 \nbased on the average annual rainfall for the period 1961-1990.  9 \n 10 \n3.3. Spatial data analyses 11 \nCatchments upstream of each of the selected monitoring sites were delineated using the DTM 12 \nand the Deterministic Eight-Direction (D8) flow routing algorithm. This was performed in the 13 \nTerrain Analysis System (TAS), a software package for performing spatial analysis operations 14 \nfor environmental applications (Lindsay, 2005). To ensure that catchment outlets were 15 \npositioned correctly on the digital stream network, the advanced outlet repositioning approach 16 \n(AORA) was used (Lindsay et al., 2008). Using the raster calculator function in TAS, the 17 \nmean elevation, slope, aspect, BFI and rainfall were derived for entire extent of each 18 \ncatchment. The percentage of each of the land cover and bedrock classes were derived in the 19 \nsame way. 20 \n 21 \n3.4. Statistical methods 22 \nTo assess potential controls on mean river water quality, stepwise multiple linear regression 23 \n(SMLR) analyses were performed. SMLR analysis identifies a subset of predictors (Table 1) 24 \nthat statistically contribute to explained variance on the response variable. Monitoring sites 25 \n  \nRothwell et al.  Predicting river water quality across North West England \n \n 9 \nwere randomly separated into two groups, the first for model derivation, and the second for 1 \nmodel validation. Given the greater uncertainty in model predictions at the catchment scale it 2 \nis important to test model outputs on large independent validation datasets (Cherry et al., 3 \n2008). Therefore, model development and validation datasets were split into two equal sized 4 \ngroups (see section 3.1 for the number of sites for each determinand).  In both groups a wide 5 \nrange of catchment characteristics and sizes were included, as well as a good spatial 6 \ndistribution of sites (Figure 1). Error was assessed for each set of values of the independent 7 \nvariables by visual examination of residuals and by diagnostic indices. Plots of the estimates 8 \nof the dependent and standardised residuals were also constructed to test for homoscedasticity. 9 \nTo assess multivariate collinearity, tolerance and variance-inflation factor (VIF) statistics 10 \nwere also assessed. These build in the regressing of each independent variable on all others. 11 \nRegression models for the determinands were tested by comparing observed mean values with 12 \nthe predicted mean values for the second independent group of sites. All statistical analyses 13 \nwere performed in JMP v8 (SAS). 14 \n 15 \n3.5. Spatial predictions of water quality 16 \nThere are a variety of GIS-based methods for interpolating and visualising the value of an 17 \nattribute at un-sampled locations (Burrough and McDonnel, 1998). Visualisation of model 18 \noutputs for large regions requires spatial aggregation. Approaches for aggregation include: 19 \nregular grid sizes (e.g. Jordan et al., 1994; Daly et al., 2002; Brazier et al., 2004; Stromqvist et 20 \nal., 2008); regular intervals on the stream network (e.g. Davies and Neal, 2004); hydrological 21 \nresponse units (e.g. Cooper et al., 2000; 2004); and catchments\/sub-catchments (e.g. Kernan 22 \net al., 2001; Wade et al., 2001; Evans et al., 2006). Visualisation of water quality predictions 23 \nat the scale of major catchments in the North West region was initially considered, but 24 \nrejected since these large-scale catchments would mask small-scale variations in catchment 25 \n  \nRothwell et al.  Predicting river water quality across North West England \n \n 10 \ncharacteristics. Predicted water quality was calculated and mapped for isobasins (similar sized 1 \nsub-catchments; Lindsay et al., 2006) within the North West region. Isobasins were created using 2 \nthe DTM and the digital stream network. Within a GIS framework, the regression equations and 3 \nspatial datasets were used to predict river water quality for each isobasin. 4 \n 5 \n4. Results 6 \n4.1. River water quality and the geography of the North West 7 \nThere is considerable variability in land cover across the North West region (Table 2). River 8 \nbasins containing monitoring sites with >40% cover of arable land include the Mersey, Ribble, 9 \nWyre and Kent. The Mersey and Wyre basins also have sites with >60% urban cover. Within 10 \nthe Ribble and Eden basins there are monitoring sites with >80% improved grassland. There 11 \nis a wide range of BFI values across the North West region. Values range from 0.22 (Mersey) 12 \nto 0.84 (Eden): low values of BFI represent high \u201cflashiness\u201d of the catchment and low 13 \npermeability of the system; higher values of BFI result in greater dampening of the rainfall 14 \nsignal and greater within-catchment storage. 15 \n 16 \nRiver basins with the highest overall mean Ca\n2+\n and Mg\n2+\n concentrations (>40 mg l\n\u20131\n 17 \nand >7.5 mg l\n\u20131 \nrespectively) are the Mersey, Ribble, Wyre and Eden. The Esk and Irt basins 18 \nhave overall mean Ca\n2+\n and Mg\n2+\n concentrations <2.5 mg l\n\u20131\n and <1.2 mg l\n\u20131 \nrespectively. pH 19 \nvalues across the region are generally circumneutral, with the exception of low values (<4.5) 20 \nat several monitoring sites within the Mersey basin. Nitrate concentrations at individual 21 \nmonitoring sites range from 0.19 mg-N l\n\u20131\n at a site in the Eden basin to 48.9 mg-N l\n\u20131\n at a site 22 \nin the Mersey basin. The river basins with the highest overall mean NO3\n\u2013\n concentrations (>2 23 \nmg-N l\n\u20131\n) are the Mersey, Ribble, Wyre, Kent, Wampool and Eden. The Leven, Esk and Irt 24 \nhave overall mean NO3\n\u2013\n concentrations <1 mg-N l\n\u20131\n. The highest mean PO4\n3\u2013\n concentration 25 \n  \nRothwell et al.  Predicting river water quality across North West England \n \n 11 \nrecorded at an EA monitoring site is 4.62 mg-P l\n\u20131\n (within the Mersey basin). The lowest 1 \nPO4\n3\u2013 \nconcentration (0.002 mg-P l\n\u20131\n) occurs in the Eden and Leven basins. There is a wide 2 \nrange of suspended solid concentrations across the North West. Values at individual sites 3 \nrange from 2.87 mg l\n\u20131\n in the Derwent basin to 110 mg l\n\u20131\n at a site in the Mersey basin. 4 \n 5 \n4.2. Linkages between water quality and catchment characteristics 6 \nStepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) analyses show that mean Ca\n2+\n concentrations are 7 \nnegatively related to mean catchment slope and positively related to the percentage of 8 \nimproved grassland cover in the catchment, percentage urban cover, and percentage limestone 9 \nbedrock (Table 3). Slope explains ~55% of the variance in mean Ca\n2+\n concentrations, with an 10 \nadditional ~20% from improved grassland and limestone bedrock. Mean Mg\n2+\n concentrations 11 \nare also related to land cover and catchment geology. Magnesium concentrations are 12 \npositively related to arable and urban cover, and negatively related to siltstone bedrock and 13 \nrainfall. River water pH is related to catchment geology (hard weathering lithologies and 14 \nlimestone) and land cover (wetland and heathland). These geological and land cover variables 15 \nexplain 60% of the variance in mean pH values. Mean NO3\n\u2013\n concentrations are positively 16 \nrelated to the cover of arable land, improved grassland and urban. Arable land explains ~40% 17 \nof the variability in mean NO3\n\u2013 \nconcentrations across the North West. Orthophosphate 18 \nconcentrations are positively related to urban cover, arable cover, and catchment area. Only 19 \n23% of the variance in PO4\n3\u2013 \nconcentrations can be explained by these characteristics, with 20 \nurban cover contributing to ~15% of the variance. Suspended solid concentrations are related 21 \nto urban cover, catchment terrain (slope and altitude) and bedrock geology (shales). Urban 22 \ncover explains ~40% of the variance in mean suspended solid concentrations. 23 \n 24 \n 25 \n  \nRothwell et al.  Predicting river water quality across North West England \n \n 12 \n4.3. Model testing 1 \nOverall, there is good agreement between observed and predicted Mg\n2+\n and pH values (R\n2\n = 2 \n0.65 and 0.60 respectively; Figure 2). Predicted Ca\n2+\n concentrations are generally in good 3 \nagreement with observed concentrations, but the model under-predicts Ca\n2+\n concentrations for 4 \na limited number of sites with observed concentrations between 60 and 90 mg l\n\u20131\n (Figure 2a). 5 \nThe results reveal that the model for NO3\n\u2013 \n-N is reasonable, but there is under-prediction of 6 \nmean NO3\n\u2013 \n-N for those sites with observed values >5 mg-N l\n\u20131 \n(Figure 2d). The results show 7 \nthat PO4\n3\u2013\n concentrations are significantly under-predicted for many sites (Figure 2e). For 8 \nsome sites there is an order-of-magnitude difference between observed and predicted PO4\n3\u2013 \n9 \nconcentrations. There is also some over-prediction for some low P sites. Comparison of 10 \nobserved and predicted SS concentrations also shows under- and over- prediction (Figure 2f). 11 \n 12 \n4.4. Spatial predictions  13 \nThe regression equations (Table 3) were used to predict the river water quality of the isobasins 14 \ncreated for the North West. Mapping the results (Figure 3) shows that the upland areas of 15 \nCumbria, the Forest of Bowland, and the Pennine fringe to the north and east of Manchester, 16 \nand the east of the Eden, have low predicted mean concentrations of Ca\n2+\n (<10 mg l\n\u20131\n), Mg\n2+ \n17 \n(<5 mg l\n\u20131\n),\n \nNO3\n\u2013\n (<0.5 mg-N l\n\u20131\n),  PO4\n3\u2013\n (<0.05 mg-P l\n\u20131\n), SS (<0.05 mg l\n\u20131\n), and pH (<5.5). 18 \nThe predictions show that the lowlands of the North West have varied water quality. Elevated 19 \nmean Ca\n2+\n, PO4\n3\u2013\n and SS concentrations (>80 mg l\n\u20131\n, >0.8 mg-P l\n\u20131\n and >50 mg l\n\u20131\n, 20 \nrespectively) are predicted for some coastal areas of the Mersey, Ribble and Wyre basins, 21 \nespecially Liverpool and Preston (Figure 3). High mean Ca\n2+\n, PO4\n3\u2013\n and SS concentrations are 22 \nalso predicted for the Greater Manchester conurbation. Low Ca\n2+\n and SS concentrations are 23 \npredicted for parts of the Lancashire Plain, which is located in the lower reaches of the Ribble 24 \nand Wyre. Predicted mean PO4\n3\u2013\n concentrations for this region range between 0.5 and 0.9 mg-25 \n  \nRothwell et al.  Predicting river water quality across North West England \n \n 13 \nP l\n\u20131\n. The Lancashire Plain has predicted high concentrations of Mg\n2+\n and NO3\n\u2013\n (>50 mg l\n\u20131\n 1 \nand >7 mg-N l\n\u20131\n respectively; Figure 3). Much of the lower reaches of the Mersey and Eden 2 \nbasins have predicted mean NO3\n\u2013\n concentrations >3 mg-N l\n\u20131\n. 3 \n 4 \n5. Discussion 5 \n5.1. Catchment drivers and pressures on water quality 6 \nThis analysis provides an assessment of the linkages between river water quality and 7 \ncatchment characteristics across North West England. For the major cations (Ca\n2+\n and Mg\n2+\n) 8 \nand river water pH there is considerable variability across the North West (Table 2). Previous 9 \nstudies have found the distribution of Ca\n2+\n and Mg\n2+\n concentrations in rivers and streams to 10 \ndepend strongly upon weathering of soil and bedrock geology (e.g. Robson and Neal, 1997; 11 \nThornton and Dise, 1998; Smart et al., 1998; Oguchi et al. 2000; Jarvie et al., 2002). In our 12 \nstudy mean Ca\n2+\n concentrations are mainly linked to slope (Table 2). Slope probably 13 \nrepresents an aggregation of rainfall, soils, geology, vegetation and temperature (weathering). 14 \nThe lowest Ca\n2+ \nconcentrations occur at sites with steeper slopes. Higher precipitation, thinner 15 \nsoils and predominantly base-poor geologies at these locations explain the low mean Ca\n2+\n 16 \nconcentrations. The SMLR identified a link between mean Ca\n2+\n concentrations and the cover 17 \nof improved grassland. This may be due to leaching of Ca\n2+\n from fertilised pastures where 18 \nliming has been used to offset soil acidification (Cuttle and James 1995; Price, 2003). Sites 19 \nwhere mean Ca\n2+\n concentrations are under-predicted (Figure 2) generally occur in river basins 20 \ncontaining intensive agriculture (Figure 4, Table 1). High fertiliser application and leaching of 21 \nCa\n2+\n from these soils (Goulding and Blake, 1998) are a possible explanation for the elevated 22 \nCa\n2+\n concentrations at these sites. Mean Mg\n2+\n concentrations are linked to the percentage of 23 \narable and urban land cover (Table 3), both of which occur in the lowlands. Permian-Triassic 24 \nsedimentary rocks dominate much of the North West lowlands, especially in the southern part 25 \n  \nRothwell et al.  Predicting river water quality across North West England \n \n 14 \nof the region. It is likely that the elevated Mg\n2+\n concentrations in the lowlands are due to 1 \nunderlying geology, rather than urban or arable land cover (Table 3). The model for pH 2 \nperforms well and the findings are consistent with similar studies (e.g. Smart et al., 1998; 3 \nThornton and Dise, 1998). The spatial prediction of pH (Figure 3) highlights low pH levels in 4 \nthe high altitude areas of the Lake District and the Pennines, and high pH in the lowland areas 5 \nand the river valleys in the north of the region.  6 \n 7 \nThe results of the analysis reveal that NO3\n\u2013\n-N is related to arable cover and, to a lesser extent, 8 \nthe cover of improved grassland and urban (Table 3). This is in agreement with other studies 9 \n(e.g. Thornton and Dise, 1998; Ferrier et al., 2001; Jarvie et al., 2002; Davies and Neal, 2007; 10 \nNeal et al., 2008). Although the analysis reveals that mean NO3\n\u2013\n concentrations are mainly 11 \nrelated to the extent of arable land, the highest observed NO3\n\u2013\n concentrations in the North 12 \nWest region occur in the urban and highly industrialised Mersey basin (Table 1). This area is 13 \ncharacterised by a large number of waste water treatment works and other effluent discharges 14 \n(Rothwell et al., 2010). Point sources have been shown to be major contributors to river NO3\n\u2013\n-15 \nN in urban environments (e.g. Davies and Neal, 2004; Meynendonckx et al., 2006). Sites 16 \nwhere there is significant under-prediction of mean NO3\n\u2013\n concentrations (Figure 2) tend to 17 \noccur in the low lying urbanised southern part of the region (Figure 4, Table 1). Point source 18 \ninputs of sewage effluent may be significant and explain the elevated concentrations in these 19 \nurban catchments. Interestingly, under-prediction of mean NO3\n\u2013\n concentrations also occurs in 20 \nrural areas (Figure 4, Table 1). Point sources associated with rural settlement may explain the 21 \nelevated observed NO3\n\u2013\n concentrations at these sites (Neal et al. 2006).  22 \n 23 \nThe results indicate that mean SS concentrations are most strongly linked to urban cover, 24 \nsuggesting that anthropogenic sources are the major contributor to fine sediment delivery in 25 \n  \nRothwell et al.  Predicting river water quality across North West England \n \n 15 \nthe North West. Ferrier et al. (2001) also found a strong link between urban catchments and 1 \nsuspended solids in Scottish rivers. Collins et al. (2008) show that sediment loss from point 2 \nand diffuse urban sources can be significant, especially in heavily urbanised regions. Urban 3 \nsuspended sediment within the North West is likely to represent a mix of point (sewage or 4 \nindustrial effluent) and diffuse (runoff from roads, industrial areas or residential housing) 5 \nsources. The challenge therefore is to evaluate the relative contributions from these diverse 6 \nsources in the urban sector. Although the SMLR did not identify agriculture as a predictor of 7 \nSS concentrations, it did identify slope and altitude as predictors (Table 3). In low-relief 8 \ncoastal locations in the North West, particularly the Ribble and Wyre (Figure 1), intensive 9 \nagriculture is common. The spatial prediction identifies this zone as having elevated SS 10 \nconcentrations (Figure 3).  11 \n 12 \nObserved PO4\n3\u2013 \nconcentrations are highly variable across the North West (Table 1), but 13 \ncomparison of observed and predicted PO4\n3\u2013 \nvalues reveals that the model fails to predict the 14 \nvery high PO4\n3\u2013\n concentrations (Figure 2). In a similar study, Davies and Neal (2007) also 15 \nreported under-prediction of PO4\n3\u2013 \nconcentrations for locations immediately downstream of 16 \nwaste water treatment works. In our study, data from EA monitoring stations immediately 17 \ndownstream of known point source inputs were not included in the analysis in an attempt to 18 \navoid the potential for sewage effluent inputs to mask relationships between water quality and 19 \nthe catchment attributes. Sites where there is significant under-prediction of mean PO4\n\u2013\n 20 \nconcentrations (Figure 2) occur in urban and rural areas of the region (Figure 4, Table 1). The 21 \nresults of this study suggest that \u201ediffuse-point\u201f source inputs (c.f. Neal et al., 2004; 2008), i.e. 22 \npoint sources at distal locations in a catchment, can still have a significant influence on river 23 \nPO4\n3\u2013 \nconcentrations further downstream. Point sources in the North West appear to be of 24 \nmajor importance with respect to PO4\n3\u2013\n-P\n \nenrichment in rivers and streams. This is consistent 25 \n  \nRothwell et al.  Predicting river water quality across North West England \n \n 16 \nwith previous studies in other regions around the UK (e.g. Neal and Jarvie, 2005; Neal et al., 1 \n2005; Jarvie et al., 2006; Neal et al. 2008; Jarvie et al., 2008). Despite the continued control 2 \nof point source discharges associated with sewage effluent and improvements in treatment 3 \nprocesses, this study clearly highlights that point sources still have a major effect of river 4 \nnutrient levels in urban and rural catchments in the North West. The linear regression model 5 \nalso over-predicts PO4\n3\u2013\n concentrations at a large number of sites in the North West (Figure 2), 6 \nespecially in the southern part of the region (Figure 4). Variation in within-river processing of 7 \nPO4\n3\u2013\n-N (House, 2003; Withers and Jarvie, 2008), may also determine PO4\n3\u2013\n concentrations 8 \nin North West rivers. Linkages between PO4\n3\u2013\n-N and catchment characteristics start to break 9 \ndown when there are within-river losses. 10 \n 11 \n5.2. The utility of the catchment characteristic approach 12 \nWater quality models using the catchment characteristic approach have been developed for 13 \nmany different environments and have proved to be highly successful in predicting variation 14 \nin catchment water quality (e.g. Donohue et al. 2005; 2006; van de Perk et al., 2007; Davies 15 \nand Neal, 2004; 2007; Helliwell et al., 2007). In this study it is clear that the approach works 16 \nwell for those water constituents derived from diffuse sources. Predicted NO3\n\u2013 \nconcentrations 17 \nacross the North West region highlight agricultural diffuse sources in coastal areas and 18 \nnutrient poor locations in the uplands (Figure 3). Although a reasonable estimate of NO3\n\u2013\n-N\n \nis 19 \nobtained, contributions from urban and rural point sources are likely to be under-represented 20 \nin the spatial prediction. The overwhelming influence of point sources on river PO4\n3\u2013 \n21 \nconcentrations makes it difficult to identify strong relationships with the catchment 22 \ncharacteristics investigated. The empirical approach could be refined by combining the 23 \nphysical catchment characteristics with information on discharge consents and population 24 \ndensity, and by combining  PO4\n3\u2013 \nconcentration data with river discharge. Non-linear 25 \n  \nRothwell et al.  Predicting river water quality across North West England \n \n 17 \napproaches could also be used to identify sites with different controls on PO4\n3\u2013 \nconcentrations. 1 \nAlbeit, the spatial prediction of mean PO4\n3\u2013\n concentrations in North West rivers (Figure 3) 2 \nserves as a broad indication of areas at risk of elevated PO4\n3\u2013\n concentrations. A combination 3 \nof the catchment characteristic approach together with models such as PSYCHIC (Davidson 4 \net al., 2008; Stromqvist et al., 2008) or the Load Apportionment Model (Bowes et al., 2008; 5 \n2009) may provide a better understanding of phosphorus variability in North West rivers.  6 \n 7 \n6. Conclusion  8 \nThis study indicates that models based on catchment characteristics can be very useful for 9 \nregional prediction of pH and the concentrations of Ca\n2+\n and Mg\n2+\n in rivers, and appear a 10 \nreasonable first approach for predicting mean NO3\n\u2013\n-N and suspended solids concentrations. 11 \nThe results show that mean NO3\n\u2013\n concentrations in North West river basins are mainly linked 12 \nto diffuse agricultural inputs, but that point source inputs are also significant in urban and 13 \nrural catchments. The results show that distal point sources within a catchment can play a 14 \nmajor role in influencing river PO4\n3\u2013 \nconcentrations further down the river network. High 15 \nconcentrations of PO4\n3\u2013\n at some sites associated with point sources may disproportionately 16 \ninfluence underlying relationships with catchment characteristics. More work is needed to 17 \nfully evaluate nutrient sources and dynamics in North West rivers, especially in the context of 18 \ncatchment management and the growing pressure for increased housing and associated 19 \nrequirements for sewage treatment.  20 \n 21 \nAcknowledgements 22 \nThe authors gratefully acknowledge funding provided by Dalton Research Institute, 23 \nManchester Metropolitan University and Manchester Geographical Society.
