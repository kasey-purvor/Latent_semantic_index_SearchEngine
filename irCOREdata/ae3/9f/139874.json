INTRODUCTION\nThermal barrier coatings act to protect the coated components from the hot gases in a gas turbine engine.\nDegradation of the coating through oxidation of the bond coat and subsequent spallation of the TBC or via\nthe stepwise removal of material due to solid particle impact, either by ingested particles or particles\ngenerated by the engine itself, can result in localised hot spots and subsequent damage to, or reduced\nservice life of, the component.\nThe primary aim of this project was to develop a computer model, based on Monte Carlo statistics that\nwould predict the erosion rate of EB PVD TBCs in order to provide design engineers with a usable tool\nfor predicting component life. But before a computer program could be written the erosion mechanism of\nthe system to be modelled had to be analysed and fully understood. Thus, the first stage of the project\nconcentrated on examining eroded specimens, analysing crack depths and distributions and gaining an\ninsight into the erosion mechanism of EB PVD TBCs. These findings have been reported in a previous\npaper [1].\nNicholls and co-workers[2-5] have done significant work on modelling erosion, looking specifically at the\nerosion of oxide scales at various temperatures. Having completed a number of single impact and\ncontinuous impact studies, they concluded that there were three main operating regimes. These were\n\u2018substrate dominated\u2019 erosion, \u2018scale modified\u2019 erosion, and \u2018scale dominated\u2019 erosion, which were all\nfunctions of temperature, particle loading and impact dynamics. Since the TBCs are nominally 150-200\n3\u00b5m thick the substrate properties are unlikely to have a major influence on the erosion mechanism, placing\nthis program of work in the \u2018scale\u2019 dominated regime.\nWhen eroding TBCs, the first consideration is the type of coating being eroded, since APS and EB-PVD\ncoatings have different microstructures and hence erosion mechanisms. In all cases, for TBCs, material\nloss is via the initiation and propagation of cracks, and hence the erosion mechanism can be classified as\nbrittle. However, under certain conditions, namely when the temperature is above the erodent softening\ntemperature, EB-PVD coatings can exhibit a \u201cductile\u201d type erosion response to impact angle, i.e. the\nmaximum wear rate occurs at impact angles near 30\u00b0[6]. This is because when the erodent softens, as in\nthe case of SiO2, at low impact angles it is able to pull out fractured sections of the coating that would\notherwise not be removed. In other words, brittle fracture of the coating still occurs, but with enhanced\nloss of material at glancing impact angles. Other important process parameters, which will need to be\ndefined \/ taken into account for any model, include particle flux, velocity, shape, density and mechanical\nproperties.\nEB PVD TBCs have a unique columnar microstructure which not only act to improve their strain\ntolerance but also act to improve their erosion resistance. Investigations into the erosion mechanisms have\nascertained that the erosive wear of EB PVD TBCs proceeds via the accumulation of damage, in the form\nof near surface (lateral type) cracks in a number of adjacent columns, prior to the removal of the tops of\nthe fractured columns [1]. It was also observed that cracks initiated in one column do not propagate into\nthe neighbouring columns, the columnar boundaries, which give EB PVD TBCs their strain tolerance, also\nact to improve their erosion resistance. Although cracks initiated in one column do not propagate into\nneighbouring columns this does not mean that a single impacting particle can only initiate cracks in one\ncolumn. If the impacting particle interacts with more than one column it is quite feasible that the impact\ncould initiate near surface cracking in a cluster of adjacent columns. The unique columnar microstructure\nof EB PVD TBCs is illustrated in Figure 1, where examples of near surface cracking can also be seen. It\n4has also been observed that cracking can also initiate from the edge of a column and propagate into the\ncolumn. These types of cracks usually initiate from growth dendrites, as illustrated in Figure 2, which\ncan act as circumferential notch defects.\n2. THE COMPUTER MODEL\nThe computer model was developed using Delphi and is purely a computational tool with a number of\ninput parameters, mainly material and system properties, and a single output, being the calculated\ndimensionless erosion rate. A number of assumptions have been made which are discussed in detail in the\nrelevant sections. In order to model the erosion it was necessary be able to \u2018visualise\u2019 an area containing a\nset number of columns that could be impacted and since it was more likely than not that any impacting\nparticle would interact with more than one column it was necessary to define first order and second order\nneighbours.\n2.1 Size of the Model\nIn order to facilitate modelling the erosion of EB PVD TBCs it was decided to approximate the shape of\nthe columns as hexagons. This means that each column has six identical nearest neighbours. The model\ncomprises of 43 columns and \u2018wraps around\u2019 such that the columns on the left edge are the nearest\nneighbours of the right edge and the top to the bottom. This is sufficiently large to cover cases where an\nimpacting particle strikes more than one column. The model comprises of a centre column with four\nconcentric rings of columns around it. The first has 6 columns the second has 12 columns, the third has\n18 columns, a fourth concentric ring of only 6 equally spaced columns was needed to ensure that all the\ncolumns have 6 nearest neighbours and 12 second order neighbours when curving the model around.\n52.2 Flow of the Program\nIn order to keep the run time of the programme to a minimum the model generates a look up table of\nvalues for a random distribution of impacting particles. The lookup table includes a number of key values\nfor a random selection of 1000 particles. The calculations for the particles include contact area, size of the\nplastic zone, maximum impact force and the critical velocity for that particular particle size. The model\nthen uses these values to calculate the erosion rate.\nOnce the lookup table has been completed the programme picks a random particle from the table then\nrandomly picks a column to impact and a position on the column to impact. This allows the model to\ndetermine the percentage of the impact that will be absorbed by the impacted column and its first and\nsecond order neighbours. Then it determines whether the columns are already cracked. If not, it will\ncalculate the depth of the possible lateral crack having checked that the impact force was sufficient to\ninitiate cracking. This is done for the impacted column and all its first and second order neighbours which\nshare a proportion of the impact.\nAfter each impact the programme checks whether any column and at least four first order neighbours have\nbeen cracked. If they have the model, sums up the material above the crack, for the central column and\neach of the nearest neighbours that have been cracked, and adds it to the total of the mass of material\nremoved. It then resets the columns as not cracked and picks another random particle from the lookup\ntable.\nDue to the fact that previous work on the erosion of EB PVD TBCs, conducted at Cranfield [1,6-9], would\nbe used to verify the model, certain information was coded into the program. This included the particle\nsize range of both the silica and the alumina erodents used in the erosion testing, as well as the pertinent\nmechanical properties. Thus the program can be tested against measured erosion rates for either alumina\n6or silica. The program provides a third option for the choice of erodent and allows the operator to select a\nparticle size characterised by a mean and a standard deviation. The flow diagram for the model is\npresented in Figure 2.\n2.2.2 Determining the Contact Position for the Centre of Impact\nFor each impacting particle a random column from the 37 main columns is chosen where the centre of\nimpact will occur. Within the column a number of positions have been defined where the centre of\nthe impact can occur, which will determine how the impact\/contact area interacts with the neighbouring\ncolumns. This is extremely important as only those columns that have been impacted can be cracked. For\neach of these impact positions and for a number of different contact-footprint sizes the percentage of the\ncontact area falling on a column and its nearest neighbours has been determined manually. This was done\nby superimposing different circles on a layout of columns and then measuring the percentage of the area\nthat fell on the different columns. The results were entered into the model as a lookup table, which allows\nthe program to distribute the impacting force between the columns that \u2018share\u2019 the impact.\n2.2.3 Determining the Contact Area and the Size of the Plastic Zone\nWhen modelling the erosion of brittle materials the depth of the impact zone, produced by the particle, is\nvery important. Evans et al. [10] postulated that lateral fracture initiates within a zone that extends to the\nelastic-plastic interface at full penetration. Hence, in modelling the erosion of brittle materials, if the\ndepth of the plastic zone can be calculated the amount of material loss per impact can then be determined.\nSlikkerveer [11] determined the maximum depth of penetration, for spherical particles, on impact to be:\n75\n2\n2\n1\n35\n2\n2\nmax 4\n5\n\uf0f7\uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf0f7\uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\uf03d\nr\nRkV\nZ\n\uf070\uf072\n- 1\nwhich, combined with Hill\u2019s [12] equation relating the depth of impact to the size of the plastic zone,\nenables one to determine the depth of cracking on impact, should cracking occur. It can be shown [13]\nthat the indentation volume, the volume of the indenter that penetrates the substrate, determines the global\nstress field around the indenter. In other words, identical plastic zone boundaries develop for spherical\nand Vickers pyramidal indentations of equal volume. If one then approximates the indented volume to be\nhemispherical (with equal volume), it is the volume of the indent that is important not the shape, Hill\u2019s\n[12] inflated hole theory can be used to give a relationship between the indent size and the size of the\nplastic zone. This relationship can be approximated by the power law given in equation 2. This\napproximation of the indented volume to a hemispherical shape could possibly result in a slight over\nestimation of the depth of the plastic zone.\ny\nH\nE\na\nb \uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\uf03d \uf06d - 2\n\uf06d and y are fitted constants, E and H are the Young\u2019s modulus and Hardness of the substrate respectively,\nwhile \u2018b\u2019 and \u2018a\u2019 are respectively the radius of the plastic zone and radius of the indented volume.\nA slightly different approach was proposed by Slikkerveer [11] for angular particles. He assumed a\nconstant indentation hardness and then equated the kinetic energy of an impacting particle (Uk) to the\nplastic work done and obtained the following equation:\n8\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 vol\nm\nind\nm\nk HdAHdPU \uf064\uf064\uf064\uf064\uf064\n\uf064\uf064\n\uf03d\uf03d\uf03d \uf0f2\uf0f2\n00\n- 3\nWhere P(\uf064) is the indentation force at a depth of \uf064, \uf064m is the maximum indentation depth and \uf064vol is the\nvolume of the indent.\nH\nU k\nvol \uf03d\uf0de \uf064 - 4\nH\nVr\nH\nmV\nH\nU k\nvol\n232\n3\n4\n2\n1\n2\n1 \uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf03d\uf03d\uf03d\n\uf072\uf070\n\uf064 - 5\nAs discussed earlier, it is the volume of the indent that is important and this can be equated to a\nhemispherical indent of radius \u2018a\u2019 such that: 3\n3\n2\navol \uf070\uf064 \uf03d .\nThus the radius of the plastic zone, b, can be expressed as:\n\uf0f7\uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf0f7\uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\uf03d\ny\nH\nE\nH\nmV\nb \uf06d\n\uf070\n3\n1\n2\n4\n3\n- 6\n3\n1\n3\n2\n3\n1 \uf02d\n\uf0b5\uf0de HVmb - 7\nEquation 17 is similar to the predictive model proposed by Evans and Wilshaw [14]. Thus it is possible to\ndetermine the depth at which lateral cracking would occur should the impacting particle supply sufficient\n9energy to initiate lateral cracking. By using Equations 1 and 2 combined with Equation 6 the program is\nable to calculate the depth within a column at which cracking will occur for both angular and spherical\nimpacting particles.\n2.2.4 Critical Velocity to Initiate Lateral Cracking\nIn a brittle erosion model it is necessary at some stage to determine whether an impacting particle will\ninitiate cracking in the target material. Thus some form of threshold value for the impact is needed. It\nwas decided in this model to use a velocity threshold.\nWhen the tensile stresses around a plastic zone, caused by indentation, exceeds the fracture limit cracks\nwill initiate. Slikkerveer[11] proposed that this initiation could be expressed as a threshold value of the\nindentation volume \uf064vol. This can be transformed to an equation for the threshold energy for lateral\nfracture which in turn yields an equation for a critical velocity needed to initiate lateral fracture, which is\ngiven by:\n2\n3\n2\n1\n4\n13\n34\n3\n, 105\nRH\nKE\nV IClcrit\n\uf072\n\uf03d - 8\nSince the model used to derive this equation predicted no influence of particle shape the above equation\ncan be used to predict lateral cracking for both spherical and angular impacting particles. The important\nfactors in equation 8 are the density and the radius terms, which in fact equate to a mass term. Thus\nequation 8 can also be written as:\n10\n2\n1\n4\n13\n34\n3\n, 215\nmH\nKE\nV IClcrit \uf03d - 9\nIt must be noted that this is a quantitative estimate of the threshold and is based on the crack length being\nequal to the size of the plastic zone. The critical velocity is dependent on the particle size and decreases as\nthe particle size and density increase. Thus, in the model, for each impacting particle it is necessary to\ncalculate the critical velocity at which it will cause lateral cracking and then determine whether the\nimpacting particle is above or below this critical velocity.\nEquation 9 allows one to simply use the mass of the impacting particle to calculate the critical velocity;\nhowever, it is still necessary to determine the percentage of the mass, of the impacting particle, that any\nparticular column sees. In a cluster of columns impacted by a particle each column experiences a different\nload, dependent on the percentage of the contact area that is in contact with the column in question. Each\ncolumn in the cluster is dealt with separately as if it had been impacted by a single particle with a mass\ncalculated as a certain percentage of the mass of the impacting particle. The percentage used is the same\nas the percentage of the contact area that is in contact with the column. This then enables the program to\ndetermine whether cracking occurs in different columns for a particular impact, when the contact footprint\ninteracts with more than one column. It is also possible to use the percentage contact area and the\npercentage mass of the impacting particle interacting with a particular column to determine the radius of a\nparticle with an equivalent mass thus enabling the use of equation 8. There is a certain degree of error\ninherent in both of these methods which increases as the contact area decreases. But since the small\ncontact areas are unlikely to cause cracking this error is not a major issue.\nThere is expected to be a certain degree of error in the critical velocity. However, as an error in this\ncalculation only becomes important in the region where the critical velocity approaches the velocity of the\n11\nimpacting particle, errors in the critical velocity are thus expected to have a minor influence on the\npredicted erosion rate of the target.\n2.2.5 Depth of Cracking in Nearest Neighbours\nFor the column in which the impact centres the crack depth is taken as the radius of the plastic zone.\nHowever, in the neighbouring columns this is not the case as the shape of the plastic zone is assumed to be\nhemi-spherical. This means that the maximum depth of the plastic zone in the neighbouring columns will\nbe less than the maximum calculated radius of the plastic zone for that particular impact. Thus in\nneighbouring columns the depth of the lateral cracking is assumed to occur at the maximum depth of the\nplastic zone in that column, which is at the column boundary shared with the column in which the impact\nis centred.\nIf the distance from the centre of the impact to the column boundary is known and the radius of the plastic\nzone is know then it is possible to calculate the depth of the plastic zone in the neighbouring columns.\nThe plastic zone does not extend into neighbouring columns unless the impacting particle also impacts the\nneighbouring columns, in other words if no portion of the impacting footprint lands on a neighbouring\ncolumn then it is totally unaffected by that particular impact. The program incorporates a look up table of\nthe distance from the centre of an impact to the column boundary for each first and second order\nneighbour, as a function of column radius. Thus the cracks, in the columns adjacent to the column in\nwhich the impact centred, are most likely to initiate from the column boundary and propagate into the\ncolumn, while the cracking in the column in which the impact centred is likely to occur within the bulk of\nthe column.\n2.2.6 Calculating the Volume of Material Removed Per impact\n12\nWhen calculating erosion rates one needs to determine volume of material lost per impact event. In the\ncase of material loss via the formation of lateral cracks in a continuum the volume can be estimated as the\nvolume of the spherical cap with the radius of the length of the lateral crack and the depth of the plastic\nzone.\nHowever, in the case of EB PVD TBCs this method can not be used due to the columnar microstructure of\nthe coating. As discussed earlier, cracks do not propagate across column boundaries. Thus material loss\nis limited by the size of the column. In the case of EB PVD TBC erosion the volume of material that is\navailable for removal after impact for each individual column is given as:\n\uf028 \uf029 lcolradiusvol *60sin**3 2\uf03d - 10\nWhere column radius is the length of one side of the hexagon and l is the depth of the lateral crack, which\nis assumed to be the same as the depth of the plastic zone. The program uses Equation 10 to determine the\nvolume loss of a column that has been cracked.\n2.2.7 Removal of Fractured Sections\nTwo methods were used to determine the number of columns that need to be fractured before material is\nlost from the coating. The first was the analysis of the number of adjacent cracks in cross sectional views\nof an eroded sample and the other was the analysis of the top section of eroded samples before steady state\nerosion was reached [1]. On first analysis it appeared as though the central column and all its first order\nneighbours needed to be cracked in order for material to be removed from the surface of the coating.\nHowever, further analysis of the top section of a number of eroded samples revealed that only four or five\nnearest neighbours around the central column needed to be cracked for material to be lost from the\n13\ncolumns. The model operates on the assumption that the central column and four nearest neighbours need\nto be cracked for material loss to occur.\n2.2.8 Input Parameters, Variables and Possible Limitations\nIn order to make the computer program as versatile as possible, it has been designed such that all the input\nparameters that the program requires can be input by the operator. However, on compiling, the program\ndoes pre-select the parameters for silica as the erodent.\nIt must be noted that the model has no inherent limits set and thus will calculate values according to the\ninput parameters. Thus it is up to the operator to ensure that the input values are reasonable and that the\nregime under investigation is compatible with the model upon which the program is based, i.e. near\nsurface cracking and no gross deformation of the coating.\nErosion maps are an excellent way to determine the erosion regime in which the system is operating. To\nthis end an erosion map was constructed for the erosion of EB PVD TBCs with silica [9], the map has\nsubsequently been modified to include an intermediate damage mechanism, termed compaction damage,\nwhich occurs between erosion and foreign object damage, as illustrated in Figure 4. Such an erosion map\nallows one to determine, from the particle size and the impact velocity, whether or not the erosion\nmechanism will be in the correct regime for the model to generate meaningful results.\n3. RESULTS FROM THE MODEL AND DISCUSSION\nThe model was run under various conditions the results of which are represented in a number of graphs\nand tables in the following sections. Each point on a graph is an average of 5 repeat runs. This was done\nbecause of the natural scatter in results generated by the statistical methods used in the program. These\n14\nresults, except where otherwise stated, were all generated using the particle size distributions that were\ncoded into the program and were based on the particle size distribution of the erodents that were used by\nJaslier[7]. This was done so that the model could be validated from the experimental results that Jaslier\nobtained from erosion testing[6-8].\nFor reasons of speed only 0.01g of erodent was used to determine the erosion rate for each test. If more\nerodent was used the run time of the program became excessive. However, some tests were run with more\nerodent and there was essentially no difference in the dimensionless erosion rates obtained.\nUnless otherwise stated the graphs were all generated using the input parameters outlined in Table 1 and\nassuming that the central column and 4 nearest neighbours need to have fractured for material loss to\noccur. A shape factor of unity was used for silica as erosion data to which the program results have been\ncompared was generated using spherical silica as the erodent.\n3.1 Repeatability of the Model\nAs can be seen from the low standard deviations in Table 2 the repeatability of the model is very good and\nis in the order of a few percent. However, there appears to be an increase in the standard deviation with an\nincrease in erosion rate.\n3.2 Validation of the Model\nIn order to validate the model, the program was run under the same conditions as previous experimental\ntests conducted at Cranfield University[6-8], which used silica with an average radius of 30 \u00b5m as the\nerodent at a velocity of 170 m\/s at room temperature. As can be seen from Table 3, under these\nconditions, there is a good correlation between the predicted erosion rates and the measured erosion rates.\n15\nFurther the literature[6] reports a linear increase in erosion rate with velocity in the zero to 300 m\/s (0-230\nfor alumina) velocity range with Erate = cV, where c is 0.102 for silica at room temperature. The predicted\nerosion rates are near linear in this region with a value for c of 0.122. With alumina as the erodent c is\n0.131experimentally, while the predicted rates give c as 0.200, which is significantly higher than that\nreported in the literature, or 0.148 if calculated from 0-230 m\/s. The latter value agrees much better with\nthe experimental data, which was determined for velocities up to 230 m\/s for alumina as the erodent.\nIt is obvious from the graph of velocity vs erosion rate (Figure 5) for both silica and alumina as the\nerodent, that there is not a true linear relationship between erosion rate and velocity. However, it was\ndecided to assume a linear rate over the range 0-300 m\/s in order to calculate the values of \u2018c\u2019 for the\npurpose of comparing the results to those reported in the literature. It is understandable that Yaslier et\nal[7,8] assumed a linear relationship between erosion and velocity since the range of velocities over which\nthey were able to test was limited, and over the range that they tested the coatings it appeared as though\nthere was a linear relationship with velocity. However, the model was able to \u2018test\u2019 the coatings at higher\nvelocities than could be obtained in the erosion rig, and the results show that erosion is not linear but in\nfact follows an exponential type relationship.\nErosion rate is often reported in the literature as:\nErate = kVn - 11\nWhere k is a constant, V is the velocity of impact and n has a value typically between 2 and 4. For the\nerosion of an EB PVD TBC, the exponent is greater than one but less than 2 as indicated in Table 4.\n16\nIt is entirely possible that at lower impact angles inaccuracies will creep into the results due to the fact that\nit is probable that some of the horizontal component of the impacting velocity will be utilised in\nfacilitating the removal of fractured sections of the coating and hence increase the erosion rate. Thus the\nmodel would predict a lower erosion rate than actually occurs in practice. It is also probable that angular\nparticles would accentuate this phenomenon.\nThe graph in Figure 6 is a comparison between the predicted and the measured [6] erosion rates for an EB\nPVD TBC eroded with silica at 170m\/s at various impact angles. As can be seen there is a good\ncorrelation between the two sets of results with the predicted results being within 20% of the measured\nresults. If the model was 100% accurate all the points would fall on the solid line.\nDavis et al[15] also reported results for EB PVD TBC coatings eroded with 63-130\u00b5m silica at 30 m\/s,\nwhich could be used to test the model. As can be seen from Table 5, there is a significant difference\nbetween the reported erosion rates of Davis et al [15] and those predicted by the model. There are a\nnumber of factors, which account for this major discrepancy in the predicted results. The most important\nof these being the size of the impacting particles, which was reported as being between 63-100\u00b5m, but no\nsize distribution was reported. Further, if one looks at the erosion map, due to the low velocity of 30 m\/s\nit appears as though the system is operating over the transition point of the lateral crack erosion\nmechanism. Thus the particle size distribution is extremely important as only the larger particles will\ncause damage. Other factors, which will affect the predicted erosion rates, are the hardness and the\nfracture toughness of the columns, but although the hardness of the coating is reported, there was no\ninformation on the properties of the individual columns. And finally the coating was a 20wt% Y2O3 and\nnot an 8wt% Y2O3 \u2013 ZrO2 EB PVD TBC.\nThe first set of predicted results in Table 5 was calculated using the input parameters coded into the model\nbut with a mean particle size of 50\u00b5m (radius) STD 20\u00b5m. The second set of results was calculated using\n17\nthe same particle size range but with a column diameter of 10\u00b5m, the size of the columns was estimated\nfrom the micrograph in the reference [15]. The difference in the two sets of predicted erosion rates\nillustrates how important the input parameters are in obtaining accurate results from the model.\n3.3 Effect of Column diameter on the Erosion Rate\nThe erosion of EB PVD TBCs does not follow a classic Hall Petch type relationship for column diameter\nvs erosion rate. The increase in erosion rate with the column size, shown in Figure 7, was expected as the\nprogram assumes that if a column is fractured the crack will run across the whole column. Thus an\nincrease in the column size will result in an increase in the erosion rate of the material. Although in most\ncases this is true, as the column size increases a stage will be reached where the cracks will not always run\nacross the whole column. At this point the program will start to over estimate the erosion rate.\n3.4 Effect of Particle Size on Erosion Rate\nIn order to determine the effect of particle size on the erosion rate, the model was run under standard\nconditions for silica as the erodent except that the particle size was varied and the standard deviation for\nthe particle size was taken as 1\u00b5m. From Figure 8 it appears as though erosion rate initially increases with\nan increase in particle size to about 15 \u00b5m and then decreases as the particle size increases. This result is\npartly due to the fact that the erosion rate is reported as mass loss per mass erodent, and is related to both\nthe number of impacting particles and a threshold particle size.\nThe initial increase in the erosion rate with particle size is due to the fact that very small particles,\nparticles less than 10\u00b5m, do not cause cracking in the coating and hence the model predicts an erosion rate\nof zero. After this threshold is passed the dimensionless erosion rate increases with an increase in particle\nsize. As the particles increase further in size the number of particles per unit mass reduces faster than the\n18\nsize of the damage zone increases due to the increase in particle size, thus the overall result is a decrease\nin the dimensionless erosion rate as the particle size increases. Under normal erosion conditions, i.e. when\neroding a continuum, the larger particles will cause considerably more damage than the smaller ones and\nhence the dimensionless erosion rate will increase with particle size, to about 100\u00b5m, after which a further\nincrease in particle size does not result in an increase in the dimensionless erosion rate. This increase in\nerosion with particles size is attributed to the larger crack lengths generated by the larger particles, and\nhence a larger amount of material is available for material removal. However, due to the columnar\nmicrostructure of the EB PVD TBC, the length of the crack generated by an impacting particle is limited\nby the size of the column, since the cracks do not propagate across the column boundaries. Thus in the\nerosion of EB PVD TBCs it is the number of impacts which cause cracking that is the rate-limiting factor\nand not the length of the crack generated, as is the case for a continuum. It must be noted that an increase\nin the particle size results in an increase in the contact area which can result in an increase in the number\nof columns damaged per impact, depending on the particle size, the column diameter and the impact\nvelocity. But this of cause is offset by the reduction in the number of impacting particles.\nAnother way of showing the effect of particle size on the erosion rate is to plot erosion rate per impact\nagainst the particle size of the impacting erodent. This is illustrated in Figure 9 and as can be seen the\nerosion rate increases with an increase in the particle size. A trend line has been added to the graph and\nforced through the intercept. The plotted data diverges from the trend line at the lower particle sizes due\nto the threshold effects.\n3.5 Effect of EB PVD TBC Hardness on the Erosion Rate\nAt first glance the effect of the target hardness, Figure 10, seems to be anomalous. However, it must be\nnoted that the hardness of the target is used in two separate sections of the program with counteracting\nresults. In the first of these the target hardness is used in the calculation of the depth of the plastic zone.\n19\nIn this case as the hardness increases the depth of penetration decreases so the erosion rate decreases.\nHowever, the hardness of the target is also used in determining the critical velocity for crack initiation. In\nthis case as the hardness increases the critical velocity to initiate cracking decreases so the erosion rate\nincreases. This is the dominant relationship until the hardness increases to the stage where most of the\nimpacting particles have sufficient velocity to initiate cracking. After this stage is reached the reduction in\nthe size of the impact event due to an increase in the hardness becomes the dominant relationship between\ntarget hardness and erosion rate and hence the erosion rate decreases as the target hardness increases.\nHowever, if it were possible to decrease the hardness of the EB PVD TBC to below 9 GPa it is entirely\npossible that a different erosion mechanism, namely one entailing damage accumulation, would be\noperating, which would require modification of the current model.\n3.6 Temperature\nThe affect of temperature on the erosion of TBCs and other materials is highly complicated and system\ndependent. As such the program is not designed to operate at elevated temperatures. However, in certain\ncases as with TBCs eroded by alumina, where the erosion mechanism is not affected by the increase in the\ntemperature, the model can still be used to predict the erosion rate. This is assuming that the operator\nknows how the material properties of the erodent and the target change with temperature and is able to\nenter the correct values into the program.\n4. CONCLUSIONS\n1. A model has been developed that permits the prediction of the erosion rate of EB PVD TBCs\nunder a wide range of erosion conditions.\n20\n2. The program has been shown to be accurate to within \u00b130%, in some cases \u00b110% for this wide\nrange of operating conditions.\n3. The erosion rate of EB PVD TBCs is not linear as previously reported, but follows a velocity\npower law Erate = kVn, where n = 1.29 for silica and 1.51 for alumina.\n4. Reducing column diameter significantly reduces the erosion rate.\n5. The erosion rate of EB PVD TBCs could be reduced by reducing the size of the dendrites formed\nduring the deposition process, as these behave like a circumferential notch, lowering the stress\nneeded to cause fracture.\n6. The model shows a better correlation with the results from literature using silica as the erodent\nthan using alumina as the erodent.\n7. The model is capable of predicting how erosion rate will change with changes in certain material\nproperties.\n21\n5. REFERENCE LIST\n1. R.G Wellman and J.R Nicholls, Wear, 242, (2000) 89.\n2.
