INTRODUCTION \nAs gate transition times decrease and wiring density \nincreases, particular attention has to be paid to noise modeling \nand its impact on performance and functionality. Delay models \nthat account for the coupling noise induced by a number of \nswitching neighboring aggressors on a victim signal are neces- \nsary. Finding the response of such systems requires the analysis \nof general arbitrarily-coupled trees. However the computational \noverhead associated with numeric techniques such as Spice is \nusually unacceptable for large designs. This has led to a prolifer- \nation of research in the past twenty years in the area of delay and \nnoise modeling, with the aim of developing simplified metrics \nthat still give acceptable accuracy. In the rest of this document, \nthe term simple tree is used to refer to a tree that has capaci- \ntances only to ground, and coupled tree to refer to a tree that con- \nsists of simple trees coupled to each other through series \ncapacitors. \nThere is a large body of literature that deals with delay mode- \nling in simple trees. One of the most important and widely used \nmetrics, the first moment of the impulse response, was proposed \nback in 1948 as an upper bound for the delay in valve circuits[l], \nand is known as the Elmore delay. Subsequently the authors of \n[2] developed tighter bounds and metrics that gave an indication \nof when the Elmore model was poor. Its attraction is that it is \nvery simple, and yet exhibits goodfidelity, giving results as good \nas more expensive models when used as a metric in interconnect \noptimization algorithms. A model based on the first and second \nmoment of the impulse response, and the sum of the open circuit \ntime constants was proposed in [3], which gives a stable approx- \nimation to the second order transfer function for simple trees. \nSince then, generic moment based techniques have been devel- \noped which are applicable to any linear circuit, and allow the \ncalculation of an arbitrary number of poles [4]. In today\u2019s sys- \ntems, delay and noise calculations are essential at an early stage \nin the planning process. However the complexity is such that \ngeneric moment matching and model order reduction techniques \nwhich require the formulation of nodal matrices and costly \nmatrix manipulations are too expensive. Hence a lot of simpli- \nfied models have been proposed. The models of 131 represent the \nmnnimum complexity for second order approximations of simple \ntrees. In [5] the authors explicitly match the first three moments \nof the impulse response to a second order model in a methodol- \nogy that guarantees stability. In [6] a heuristic delay model based \non the first two moments was proposed. \nIn analyzing coupled trees, most research has concentrated on \ncertain simplified configurations of interest. In [7] the authors \npresent two pole delay models for a single n section, and extend \nit to accommodate multiple segmented aggressors in [8], but the \nallowed topology is still limited. In [9] the authors use circuit \ntransformations to simplify a general tree to a 2-n model when \nanalytic formulae can be used, but intermediate steps require the \ncalculation of admittances at each branch point and the estima- \ntion of equivalent capacitances which increase run time and \nimpact on the accuracy respectively. In [lo] a technique is pre- \nsented to generate the poles of a system with n storage elements, \nwhich has long been used i n  analog design to estimate the band- \nwidth of amplifiers. The complexity of the computation is pro- \nportional to nu where a is the order of the pole. There are works \nwhich use this technique to estimate the two lowest frequency \npoles and use them to model the response for all switching \nevents on the tree [ 1 I][ 121. This can result in unacceptable accu- \nracy, as the poles which determine the response for different \nswitching events can be very far apart on the frequency axis. If \nused to generate higher frequency poles, this estimation tech- \nnique will become prohibitively expensive. \nIn this paper we propose metrics based on the first and second \nmoment of the impulse response to generate second order trans- \nfer functions from each driver to the receiver in arbitrarily-cou- \npled trees, which allow both delay and noise estimations. Our \ncontributions are that the moments are matched to the character- \nistic time constants in a novel way which minimizes computa- \ntional complexity while allowing good accuracy, and that the \nmoments themselves are calculated from completely accurate \nclosed form expressions which are only slightly more complex \nthan the Elmore delay, while retaining all its elegance. In this \npaper we are only concerned with the generation of the transfer \nfunction, which is the most important aspect of the modeling. \n2. MODELING \nThe modeling requires the matching of easily calculable met- \nrics of the circuit to the system transfer function.

Example coupled RC tree \nascertaining the characteristics of the transfer function, calculat- \ning the metrics and then matching them to the terms in the trans- \nfer function. \nA coupled RC tree is characterized by a resistive path from the \nreceiver node e to the forcing (victim) driver, and series capaci- \ntive elements to other (aggressor) drivers. Hence when the victim \ndriver switches the output will always change rails, while it will \nstart and end at the same rail for an aggressor switching. There- \nfore the transfer functions characterizing the response to the vic- \ntim switching and any of the aggressors switching are different. \nThe former will have a zero on the negative part of the real axis: \nwhile the latter will have a zero at the origin. \n5 U; \n= ( 1  + S Z , ) ( l  +SZ2) \n2.1 Calculation of moments \nIn the following section, expressions are presented for the first \nand second moment of the impulse response for general coupled \ntrees, which form the core of our models. The derivation is based \non Kirchoff's laws and integration by parts, and is omitted due to \nlack of space. Shown in Fig. 1 is an example of a coupled tree \nwhich can be referred to in the following descriptions. First our \nnotation is described below. \nCSE = capacitance to ground at node k in pth tree \nCG,\" = capacitance between node k on pth tree and node j on qth \n! tree (first sub(super)script refers to reference tree) \nRlk), = resistance shared on paths between source to nodes e and k \non tree p \nT; = nth moment of the impulse response at the kth node \nIt should be noted that superscripts always refer to simple trees \nwhile subscripts always refer to nodes, except in the definition \nfor moments, where the superscript refers to the order of the \nmoment. Additionally, rail voltages are normalized to 0 and 1, \nand the expressions always derived for a positive step without \nloss of generality. \nThe first moment of the impulse response at the receiver node \ne for the victim driver switching is given by: - \n0 \nNow the impulse response is the first time derivative of the step \nresponse, for which an expression can be formulated by sum- \nming up all capacitor currents. This can then be integrated by \nparts to yield (4), where a,, a2.. are the aggressors. \nk e  v ic t im \nThe second moment of the impulse response at e is given by: - \n0 \nFollowing the procedure described above in two stages, this can \nbe shown to be equivalent to (6). \nFrom an approach identical to the former case, the first \nmoment of the impulse response at node e on the victim tree for \naggressor ai switching can be shown to be: \nk E v ic t im \nand the second moment: \nk e  v ic t im \n+ C C y ' [  R:,(CS$+ CC$'y+ CC$''+ ...)I) \nK E  a.  \n= -2@j2 \nThe expressions in (4), (6), (7) and (8) form the basis of our \nproposed models. An examination of these reveal their similarity \nto the Elmore delay, and all the accompanying characteristics \nthat make the estimation algorithms very efficient. \n2.2 Matching moments to the characteristic \ntime constants in the circuit \nThe moments can be matched to the characteristic time con- \nstants in the circuit by using the identity that the nlh moment of \nthe impulse response is (-ly times the nlh derivative of the trans- \nfer function evaluated at s=O. This identity used on ( l ) ,  (4) and \n(6) results in: \nIV-605 \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library. Downloaded on May 07,2010 at 13:36:15 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. \nNow additional information is necessary to solve for the three \nunknowns in (9) and (10). If the reciprocal pole sum is desig- \nnated as these two equations can be combined to form the \nfollowing quadratic, which yields two time constants. \nv 2  (1  1) T* - T,sumT + T;eT.sum - ( T q )  = 0 \nThe mathematical basis of our reduced order model is that \ngeometric attributes (area and first moment of the area) and the \nvalues at t=O and t - w  of the estimated and actual waveform are \nequated. Since the initial and final values are already considered \nin the formulation of the transfer function, additional information \nis necessary to solve for the two poles and zeros associated with \na switching event. At this point, it is helpful to look at the physi- \ncal interpretation of the first and second moments of the impulse \nresponse. The first moment always considers resistances of the \nswitching line, and either all capacitances connected to the \nswitching line (in the case of the victim driver switching) or \ncapacitances connecting it to a particular line (for the switching \nof an aggressor driver). The second moment propagates outwards \nanother level, and considers the resistances and capacitances of \nimmediately adjacent lines as well. This intuition is valuable in \ngenerating a solution with minimum computational complexity; \nnamely, equation (1 1) can be used to generate the pole time con- \nstants for all switching events, by using the appropriate recipro- \ncal pole sum. \nFor the victim switching, the metric that gives the best solu- \ntion is the sum of the open circuit time constants with reference \nto the victim driver, which we shall call T;. This is simply the \nsummation of the products of all capacitances connected to the \nvictim line with the driving point resistance to each of those \ncapacitors. This is a good approximation for the sum of the pole \ntime constants[lO], giving: \nCondition \nno violation \nTo solve for the poles and zeros associated with an aggressor \nswitching, the above identity is used on (2 ) ,  (7) and (8) to give: \n\u2018S\u201d,, \n[ r u i  )*\/:i \nGo De \nNow the zero time constant is available immediately, and divid- \ning (14) by (1 3) results in the reciprocal pole sum: \nThe pole time constants can be obtained by substituting (15) as \nT ~ ~ , , ,  in (1 1). Since minimum information is used for both cases, \nsome slight modification is necessary to guarantee stability, as \nexplained below. \nThe conditions for potential instability can be identified by \nanalyzing the quadratic which yields the time constants. The first \nlimiting condition is that the magnitude of the square root should \nbe greater than the reciprocal pole sum, which yields: \nv 2  v (A) \n\u2018sum \u2019 (\u2018SG,) I\u2019D, \nThe second is that the sign under the radical is negative, which, \nTable 1. Different values for T~,,, for an aggressor switching \nI I \nafter some simplification, results in the following: \nAn inspection of the relevant expressions shows that the only \npossible violation in the case of the victim driver switching is \n(B). i.e. very occasionally, using T,* can result in complex poles. \nThe physical interpretation of such an occurrence is that the sum \nof the open circuit time constants underestimates the reciprocal \npole sum, which has been unusually escalated by an aggressor or \naggressors with exceptionally high parasitics. Because both \nexponential waveforms are either additive or subtractive unlike \nwhen an aggressor switches (where one is additive and the other \nis subtractive), the higher frequency pole does not have a signifi- \ncant impact. In fact, this form of instability is usually an indica- \ntion of a very low frequency pole which makes the prediction of \nthe waveform straightforward. The simplest remedy therefore is \nto consider a single pole response, with the pole time constant \nbeing given by TLc, which results in good accuracy as shown in \nthe results section. \nFor the case of an aggressor driver switching, the only possi- \nble violation is (A). This is in fact the more common form of \ninstability encountered and occurs when the dominant poles for \nthe victim and the particular aggressor are very far apart on the \nfrequency axis. Physically, this translates to a situation where the \nreceiver node is charged extremely rapidly by a very strong \naggressor (i.e. through a relatively very small time constant), and \ndecays with a very long tail, dictated by the much larger time \nconstant of the victim. Such behavior is common for far end cou- \npling, The instability in the solution predicted by (1 1) occurs \nbecause the reciprocal pole sum given by (15) accurately reflects \nthe high frequency nature of the poles in the aggressor\u2019s charging \npath, but 7Le and (x;)* reflect the much lower frequency con- \ntent of the victim\u2019s dominant poles, and the gap is too much to \nbridge. The solution without generating extra information about \nthe circuit, is to accept the next best approximation. That is to \nsay, if T~\u201d,,, is so small that it violates inequality (A), the simplest \nand most logical remedy is to increase T,,,,, so that real roots are \ngenerated. Since the equality will generate coincident poles \nwhich is not acceptable, the exact value should be chosen so that \nit is slightly greater than the equality, which can be achieved with \na percentage factor, such as 1%. This yields accurate results, \nbecause the intention is to generate the best fwo pole single zero \nIV-606 \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Following this \napproach, the values that T~\u201d,,, should take in the different cases \nare summarized in Table 1. \n3. RESULTS \nThe proposed metrics were tested on several different test \nbeds which cover a wide range of topologies and all the corner \ncases where conditions (A) and (B) are violated, by comparing \nthe step response for different switching events with Spectre sim- \nulations. Due to space restrictions, only the results pertaining to \nthe tree shown in Fig. 1 consisting of the victim, three primary \naggressors, and three secondary aggressors are presented. Shown \nin Fig. 2 are the waveforms (step response) at the receiver node e \nfor each driver switching. It can be seen that the model prediction \nis very close to the Spectre simulation. In the case of the victim \nswitching, inequality (A) is violated, and the single pole response \nshows good accuracy. Since the actual and predicted delay at a \nsingle threshold can agree very well, and still result in significant \ndeviations along the full waveform, we tested the accuracy at \nthree points along the waveform. For the victim switching, the \nthresholds are lo%, 50% and 90%, while for the aggressors they \nare 25%, 50% and 75% of the peak amplitude. The error at dif- \nferent thresholds is given as a fraction of the pulse width from v, \nto vj for the aggressors. \n4. CONCLUSIONS \nClosed form expressions for the first two moments of the \nimpulse response for general coupled RC trees were presented, \nand used to generate second order approximations to the transfer \nfunction for any switching event with guaranteed stability. The \nsummation of all waveforms results in the complete response at \nthe node of interest. The new models we propose represent the \nminimum complexity for second order estimations of coupled \ntrees when generality is not compromised, and in fact subsume a \nlot of models that address simplified structures. For testing pur- \nposes, these expressions were used to derive the time domain \nwaveform for the step response. The accuracy with which the \ndelay at a given threshold is predicted was found to be more than \n90%, even for complex circuits such as shown in Fig. 1. The \npeak noise was predicted with similar accuracy on circuits repre- \nsentative of nano meter interconnect structures. The simplicity \nand accuracy of the models combined with their generality \nshould make them useful in delay and noise estimations in com- \nplex systems, early in the design flow. \n5.
