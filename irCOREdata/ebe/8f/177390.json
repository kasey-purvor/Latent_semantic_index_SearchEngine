The aim\nof this paper was to explore the perceptions and experiences of individuals with headache and their\nexperiences of associated healthcare and treatment.\nMethods: A qualitative study of individuals with headache, sampled from a population-based study\nof chronic pain was conducted in the North-East of Scotland, UK. Seventeen semi-structured\ninterviews were conducted with adults aged 65 or less. Interviews were analysed using the\nFramework approach utilising thematic analysis.\nResults: Almost every participant reported that they were unable to function fully as a result of\nthe nature and unpredictability of their headaches and this had caused disruption to their work,\nfamily life and social activities. Many also reported a negative impact on mood including feeling\ndepressed, aggressive or embarrassed. Most participants had formed their own ideas about\ndifferent aspects of their headache and several had searched for, or were seeking, increased\nunderstanding of their headache from a variety of sources. Many participants reported that their\nheadaches caused them constant worry and anguish, and they were concerned that there was a\nserious underlying cause. A variety of methods were being used to manage headaches including\nconventional medication, complementary therapies and self-developed management techniques.\nProblems associated with all of these management strategies emerged.\nConclusion: Headache has wide-ranging adverse effects on individuals and is often accompanied\nby considerable worry. The development of new interventions or educational strategies aimed at\nreducing the burden of the disorder and associated anxiety are needed.\nBackground\nHeadaches are common, with almost everyone experienc-\ning at least one during their lifetime [1]. The lifetime prev-\nalence of headache has been estimated to be up to 96% in\nthe adult population [1], and one-year prevalence esti-\nmates range from 38% [2] to 68% [3]. Many people expe-\nrience headaches on a frequent basis: a recent UK survey\nfound that 18% of respondents had experienced head-\naches one to three times a week during the previous three\nmonths, with 6% experiencing them more often [4].\nPublished: 02 May 2006\nBMC Family Practice 2006, 7:27 doi:10.1186\/1471-2296-7-27\nReceived: 06 December 2005\nAccepted: 02 May 2006\nThis article is available from: http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2296\/7\/27\n\u00a9 2006 Leiper et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/2.0), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Page 1 of 11\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Family Practice 2006, 7:27 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2296\/7\/27Headaches have been shown to have an adverse impact on\nwork, [4-7] social and family life [8-11] and are associated\nwith large medical costs [12]. Studies investigating the\nmanagement of headache have shown that most individ-\nuals use prescription and\/or non-prescription (over-the-\ncounter) medication [5,9]. Many individuals manage\ntheir headaches without consulting their general practi-\ntioners [5,9,13], some choosing alternative forms of\nhealthcare.\nMuch of our knowledge about the frequency and manage-\nment of headache have come from quantitative studies.\nWhile these studies provide important information about\nthe magnitude and impact of the problem, they are not\nable to examine unique aspects about the condition for\nindividual patients. By contrast few qualitative studies of\nheadache have been conducted and as a result we have lit-\ntle in-depth understanding of the experiences and percep-\ntions of people with headache. An in-depth\nunderstanding of the experiences of people with headache\nis important if we are to develop new treatments, interven-\ntions or educational strategies that might reduce the bur-\nden of the disorder and qualitative studies of headache\nhave been called for to address this gap [14]. Such studies\nare beginning to emerge, [15-17] but work has tended to\nfocus on migraine and further research is still needed. We\nreport here the findings from a qualitative study con-\nducted to explore the experiences and perceptions of peo-\nple with headache, and their experiences and expectations\nof associated healthcare and treatment.\nMethods\nDesign and sample\nParticipants were sampled from respondents to a popula-\ntion-based study [18,19] conducted in the Grampian\nregion of Scotland, UK which investigated the prevalence\nand natural history of chronic pain (pain or discomfort,\npresent either all the time, or on and off, which had per-\nsisted for three months or longer [20]). A total of 660\nrespondents in 2000 reported having chronic pain in their\nhead. Of these, 73 individuals identified the head as either\nthe only site, or the main site, of their pain and were\ndefined as having chronic head pain. A total of 59 of these\nindividuals indicated a willingness to participate in fur-\nther research. From this group, a purposive sample of 30\nindividuals was selected to include males and females\naged 65 and under, with different levels of severity of\nchronic pain (as measured by the chronic pain grade [21])\nand self reported use of different healthcare services. The\n30 individuals were sent letters detailing the purpose of\nthe study and inviting them to participate in an interview\nabout their headaches. Individuals who did not, or no\nlonger, suffered from headaches were given the opportu-\nnity to opt-out if their participation was not felt to be\nappropriate. Reminders were sent four weeks later to non-\nrespondents. Ethical approval for the study was given in\nadvance by the Grampian Research Ethics Committee.\nA semi-structured interview schedule (Table 1) was devel-\noped, covering issues identified as potentially important\nfrom a review of the literature. The interview started with\nan open question inviting participants to tell us about\ntheir headaches. This allowed the participants to raise any\nissues that they felt to be important. If issues arose that\nweren't on the topic guide the interviewer ensured that\nthese issues were discussed further during the interview.\nThe closed questions detailed in the schedule were not\ndirected towards the participants, but simply used as a\nguide by the interviewer to the topics to be covered and to\nidentify further relevant areas of interest. Open-ended\nquestions were used throughout the interviews to encour-\nage participants to answer openly and unrestrictedly. The\nschedule was piloted on four researchers with experience\nin conducting qualitative interviews so that areas for\nimprovement could be identified. This led to some\namendments to the schedule. Formal headache diagnoses\nwere not sought from GP records. Participants were asked\nto self-report what types of headache they suffer from.\nThe interviews were conducted by DAL between October\nand December 2002. All of the interviews took place in\nparticipants' homes except for one which took place on\nUniversity premises at the participant's request. Informed\nconsent was sought and granted in all patients inter-\nviewed and participants' anonymity and confidentiality\nwere ensured. All interviews were audio-taped with the\nparticipants' permission and lasted an average of 45 min-\nutes. Immediately after each interview, brief notes were\nmade by DAL, detailing interesting points made, or\nbehaviours displayed, by the participants. Within two\ndays after the completion of the interview the tapes were\ntranscribed verbatim by the interviewer. A sample of tapes\nand transcripts were reviewed by AME to check that the\ninterviews had been accurately transcribed. Tapes and\ntranscripts were marked with ID numbers to ensure ano-\nnymity and were stored securely to maintain confidential-\nity.\nAnalysis\nThe interviews were analysed using the Framework\napproach: a thematic analysis consisting of five stages\n[22]. The first stage, 'familiarisation', was achieved by\nreading each transcript and noting down recurring issues.\nAll transcripts were read twice by DAL and once by at least\none other member of the research team (AME and PCH).\nHaving done this, the second stage, 'identifying a thematic\nframework' was completed by arranging the recurrent\nissues that had emerged into themes and sub themes\n(Table 2). Interesting and relevant quotes were also iden-\ntified at this stage to illustrate the themes.

For the fourth stage, 'charting', charts were con-\nstructed for each of the main themes that emerged, with\nsub-theme categories placed along the top of the charts\nand participants placed down the sides. By conducting\neach of these four steps accurately and rigorously, the fifth\nstep, 'mapping and interpretation', was simply achieved\nby placing relevant sections of the transcript into the\nappropriate charts. The Framework approach makes\nbetween and within subject analysis possible enabling\nresearchers to compare and contrast participants' opin-\nions and perceptions in each sub-theme, therefore illus-\ntrating the similarities and differences between them.\nReliability of the data and interpretation of the findings\nwere checked at each stage of the process (AME and PCH).\nResults\nResponse\nNineteen out of the thirty individuals contacted agreed to\nparticipate in the study, 5 respondents indicated that they\ndid not wish to participate, and the remaining 6 did not\nrespond. Reasons for non-participation were not sought.\nA total of 17 interviews were conducted. Mutually conven-\nient interview times could not be arranged for the last two\nindividuals within the timescale of the study.\nSample characteristics\nTable 3 details the participant characteristics, headache\ncharacteristics and associated health care utilisation in the\nlast year of the participants. Most respondents reported\nsuffering from migraines or tension-type headaches. The\nfrequency of headaches in the sample ranged from daily\nto monthly. Many participants reported that the fre-\nquency of their headaches changed depending on the\ntime of year and their current circumstances (i.e. levels of\nstress at work, family commitments, other health prob-\nlems etc). Most of the individuals interviewed had been\nsuffering with headaches for several years. Most partici-\npants reported that their headaches were of mild to mod-\nerate severity, but some reported severe headaches.\nThe themes\nA number of interesting issues were raised throughout the\ninterviews, many of which were inter-related and overlap-\nping. However, three broad themes emerged: 'impact on\nlife', 'knowledge and understanding', and 'management'.\nA summary of the themes and sub-themes emerging from\nthe interviews is shown in Box 2.\nImpact on life (Table 4)\nAlmost every participant reported that various aspects of\ntheir lives had been adversely affected by their headaches\nincluding work, social and family life and mood.\nInability to function fully\nMost participants mentioned that it was difficult to carry\nout daily activities and that their headaches stopped them\ndoing things to the best of their abilities. At work, several\npeople found it hard to concentrate when suffering a\nheadache and felt their performance had been limited.\nMost had experienced disruption to their work or careers\nin some way and taking time off was common. Some par-\nticipants stated that their headaches had prevented them\nTable 2: Themes and sub-themes\nImpact on life\n- inability to function fully\n- unpredictability of headaches\n- effect on mood\n- getting on with things\nKnowledge and understanding\n- lay understanding and explanation\n- seeking of information\n- worry\nManagement\n- use of conventional medication\n- use of complementary therapies\n- GP management\n- own management techniques\nTable 4: Quotes relating to impact on life\nInability to function fully \u2013 \"You canna (can't)think clearly and you look at a sheet of paper and try and read it and you're not taking it in... your brain doesna \n(doesn't)work as well.

Accounts were also\ngiven of several ways in which family and social life was\ndisrupted by an inability to function fully. Some people\nhad been forced to give up hobbies for example reading\nand hill-walking and common daily activities like driving\nand sleeping were often affected. Several people spoke of\nwanting to be alone when suffering from a headache and\nnot being bothered by anything or anyone. This appeared\nto be particularly problematic for those with more fre-\nquent headaches, and some expressed concerns about\nhow this affected their relationships with family and\nfriends.\nUnpredictability of headaches\nSeveral participants found that their headaches were\nunpredictable and said that they had a lack of control over\nthe course of a headache which impacted on all aspects of\ntheir life. It was common for example for participants to\nhave to be sent home from work because a headache had\ndeveloped. Some participants reported that the unpredict-\nability of headaches had also impacted on their family\nlives. For example, many spoke of incidents where their\nheadaches had caused them to miss out on something\nthey were looking forward to or had spoiled their enjoy-\nment of an event. Those who had found effective ways of\nmanaging and coping with their pain were less troubled\nby the fact that their headaches could occur at any time.\nEffect on mood\nThe headaches also affected participants' lives by nega-\ntively impacting on mood. Descriptions of the effects\nheadaches had included feeling depressed or down, self-\npity, aggression and embarrassment. Depression seemed\nto occur quite commonly among the participants and one\nman disclosed suicidal feelings because of his constant\npain.\nGetting on with things\nIn spite of the pain and their lives being adversely dis-\nrupted, some participants expressed the need to get on\nwith things, stressing the importance of carrying on and\nnot letting headaches govern them. Some participants\nwent to work and attended social engagements when suf-\nfering a headache and spoke of persevering because they\nfelt a responsibility to others. Some had begun to feel that\ntheir headaches were just part of their lives. This feeling\nseemed to be more common among those who had suf-\nfered headaches for many years.\nKnowledge and understanding (Table 5)\nParticipants had developed their own ideas about aspects\nof their headaches, often suffered from worry about their\ncondition and were seeking additional information from\na variety of sources.\nLay understanding and explanation\nMost participants had formed their own ideas about dif-\nferent aspects of their headaches including diagnosis,\nunderlying cause and severity. These ideas were often\ninfluenced by the experiences of friends and family or\nfrom articles they had read. Some participants had not\nreceived a formal diagnosis for their headaches but had\ncome up with one themselves based on how their symp-\ntoms compared with others they knew or had read about.\nPatients who believed they had a stressful lifestyle for\nexample diagnosed themselves with tension-type head-\nache, while those with frequent severe headaches often\nbelieved they must be suffering from migraines. Several\nparticipants had also developed their own ideas on the\ncause of their headaches and many believed that the\nunderlying cause of their pain was serious. Brain tumours,\nTable 5: Quotes relating to knowledge and understanding\nLay understanding and explanation \u2013 \"And I don't know what the cause of them is and was, I mean, I speculated and thought, could it be this and could it be \nthat...

Stress is a major \nthing with me, sort of getting very anxious and tense... Hormones was one of the things that I kept tossing about, they weren't migraines...

Many patients had also identified triggers for\ntheir headaches such as stress, diet and lifestyle factors.\nPatients were also trying to understand changes in the\nseverity of their headaches. Reasons given for why head-\naches had improved included being more relaxed, chang-\ning diet, and getting older. Headaches which had\ndeteriorated often caused worry and reinforced the belief\nof a serious underlying pathology.\nSeeking of information\nMany participants had searched, or were searching, for an\nincreased understanding of their headaches to try to make\nsense of it all. In particular patients were looking for a\ndiagnosis or explanation of the cause of their headaches.\nSome participants preferred to obtain advice directly from\ntheir general practitioners. GP's were often consulted for\ninformation, particularly about new treatments or details\nof drug side effects or interactions. Many participants\nreported that they had also read books, magazine articles\nor searched the Internet for information about headaches.\nInformation was also sought from others such as friends\nand family. Most participants had obtained information\nfrom a variety of sources, and some considered them-\nselves to be quite knowledgeable about their condition as\na result.\nWorry\nSeveral participants said that their headaches had, at some\npoint, caused them constant and often substantial worry.\nMany had been worried and frightened when they first\nstarted suffering headaches, a particular concern being\nthat the underlying cause might be serious. Others spoke\nof being greatly worried even though they had suffered\nheadaches for years. Interestingly, receipt of a formal diag-\nnosis from a GP did not seem to reduce worry in some\nparticipants and had triggered many to search for\nincreased knowledge and understanding of the problem.\nIt also resulted in a number of participants consulting\ntheir GP with the expressed wish for further diagnostic\ntests. The few participants who had received brain scans to\nrule out serious underlying pathology stated that they had\nbeen relieved to receive the \"all clear\" and their worry had\nreduced afterwards. Indeed, some reported that their\nheadaches had diminished as a result.\nManagement (Table 6)\nMost participants had used or were still using a variety of\nmanagement strategies including conventional, comple-\nmentary and personally developed management tech-\nniques.\nUse of conventional medication\nNearly all participants used conventional medication.\nParticipants who reported having migraines most often\nused drugs obtained by prescription, whereas those who\nhad tension or sinus-related headaches generally reported\nusing non-prescription treatments. Some individuals used\nmedicines obtained by both routes, particularly those\nwho experienced a variety of headache types or who had\nchronic daily headaches and many found non-prescrip-\ntion medication just as effective as that obtained on pre-\nscription. There were several positive comments made\nabout medications, however, a number of individuals\nexpressed concerns. The lack of effectiveness of medica-\ntions, side effects and drug interactions were of most con-\ncern. Many of those who had been on medication for their\nheadaches for a long time no longer found their medi-\ncines as effective as they had initially. A number of the par-\nticipants who reported suffering from side effects also had\nrelatives or friends who had experienced problems while\ntaking medication. Drug interactions appeared to be a\nproblem for a number of respondents particularly for\nthose who took a number of different medicines. A\nTable 6: Quotes relating to management\nUse of conventional medication \u2013 \"... I wonder myself sometimes because I just wonder if some pills is working against the other eens (ones)and ken?

Homeopathy and reflexology were the most fre-\nquently mentioned therapies. Most users were positive\nabout their experiences, and most of the participants who\nhad never tried them found the idea appealing. Many\nindividuals had stopped using alternative therapies,\ndespite finding them useful, because they cost too much\nwhile others had stopped using them because they simply\ndidn't find them helpful.\nG P management\nMost participants had consulted, or were still consulting\ntheir GP about their headaches. Many were satisfied with\ntheir care and generally had positive opinions of their\ndoctors although some negative comments were made\nincluding that the GP was dismissive or disinterested in\nthe problem. Reasons for seeking or not seeking help from\na GP for headache were explored. Headache severity was a\nstrong influence, with a change in, or worsening of, symp-\ntoms often the prompt for consulting. Effectiveness of\nmanagement strategies also had a strong bearing on\nwhether participants consulted: those who had already\nfound an effective way of controlling their headaches\nreported visiting their GP less often than those who strug-\ngled to contain their symptoms. Some of the respondents\nwho were no longer seeing their GP were using over-the-\ncounter medicines for their headaches and appeared to\nhave them under control so did not feel they needed to\nconsult with their GP. Other reasons for not consulting\nincluded: belief that the doctor did not have enough time;\nprevious bad experience with a doctor; being concerned\nabout the expense of treatments; or worry about what the\ndoctor might think about them.\nOwn management techniques\nIn addition to using medicines and consulting health pro-\nfessionals, participants described a number of other tech-\nniques that they had found helpful for alleviating their\nsymptoms. Common strategies included lying down in\ndarkened rooms, or using cold or warm compresses. How-\never, some described less conventional techniques such as\ndigging their fingers into their necks or banging their\nheads off walls.\nDiscussion\nSummary of findings\nWe found that headaches frequently adversely affect the\nlives of sufferers, with some wide-ranging effects on work,\nfamily life, social activities and mood. Many individuals\nhad developed their own explanations for their headaches\nand many reported worry about the cause of the head-\naches. As a result most participants were searching for an\nincreased understanding of their condition. Although the\nGP was seen as an important source of advice and treat-\nment, many individuals were concerned about taking\nmedication and many were trying complementary thera-\npies or using their own management techniques.\nStrengths and limitations of the study\nThis study interviewed men and women from the general\npopulation who suffered from different types of headache\nwith various causes, frequency and severity. It is one of the\nfirst qualitative studies to explore the experiences and per-\nceptions of people with varying headache types and pro-\nvides important in-depth understanding of the range of\nproblems headache sufferers face including the impact of\nheadaches, understanding and knowledge about head-\naches and experiences and expectations associated with\nhealthcare and treatment. By studying the broad spectrum\nof headache types, rather than limit ourselves to one spe-\ncific type, we were able to identify a range of issues rele-\nvant to headache and its impact. Although this approach\nmeans that some of our findings will not be relevant to all\nheadache sufferers the approach has provided a useful\ninsight into the differences in perceptions and experiences\nof headache sufferers. It has also highlighted some issues\nthat will be worth exploring in sub-groups of individuals,\nparticularly with a view to developing new treatments.\nInformation on the cause of the head pain was not deter-\nmined in the original cohort and so we do not know if the\nindividuals interviewed in this study had a primary head-\nache disorder or whether the headache was a result of\nsome other cause such as trauma. Our results can only\napply to the age range of individuals included in the sam-\nple. Specific issues important to groups outwith this age\nrange will not have been identified. In addition, since par-\nticipants were sampled from a group of individuals with\nself-reported chronic pain (pain persisting beyond three\nmonths), our findings may not reflect the experiences of\npeople who's headaches have not persisted this long.\nLocal availability of different services may have driven use\nof certain services, and this may vary by geographical loca-\ntion across the UK. The researcher's roles and opinions\nmay have affected both the data collection and interpreta-\ntion. This was minimised where possible by having checks\non the data by a second member of the research team.\nImportant issues to emerge and comparison with other \nstudies\nSeveral important issues emerged from our study, some of\nwhich have been reported in previous studies and some of\nwhich have not been documented before. The impact of\nheadaches on life emerged as a key theme in this study\nand has been well documented in previous quantitative\nstudies [4-11] and in the qualitative studies that have beenPage 8 of 11\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Family Practice 2006, 7:27 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2296\/7\/27undertaken [15-17]. Our findings on the impact of head-\nache on daily functioning (including impact on work,\nsocial and family life and mood) are broadly in line with\nprevious qualitative studies of headache, despite differ-\nences in the type of headache investigated and the popu-\nlations studied. In a focus group study in the US with 24\npeople who had been experiencing migraines for at least\n6 months Cottrell et al [15] reported that all aspects of\nfamily, recreational and social activities had been ham-\npered by their headaches. The effect on work was substan-\ntial, with participants reporting having to go home early\nand feelings of guilt for not carrying a fair share of the\nworkload. They also found that many participants\nexpressed apprehension about losing their jobs because of\nthe time they missed. This did not emerge as a clear issue\nin our study and may be more relevant to migraine suffer-\ners who are likely to take more time off work. Ruiz de\nVelasco et al [16] in a Spanish study on quality of life in\nmigraine patients reported similar impacts on work and\nstudies, life within the family, social relationships, and\nleisure time. They found that respondents had difficulties\nin performing their duties at work and felt they couldn't\nfulfil their real potential. Many participants reported diffi-\nculties in going out with other people and some reported\nthat they had declined to participate for fear of having a\nmigraine attack. They found a greater impact on family\nrelationships than we reported, particularly in terms of\nthe effect on children. This may have been because the age\nrange of our participants meant that fewer respondents\nhad young children at home. Like us Ruiz de Velasco et al\nfound that the impact on mood was an important issue\nwith their respondents reporting mood swings, unhappi-\nness and hopelessness and a greater lack of emotional\ncontrol. Contrary to this Cottrell et al [15] reported that\ntheir participants denied emotional distress despite the\nemotional charge obvious in many of their statements.\nOur study adds some understanding to the wide-ranging\nand extreme effects headache can have on peoples lives,\nfor example forcing people to change career or leading to\nsevere depression and thoughts of suicide. Further work is\nnecessary to identify ways that impact can be minimised\nand quality of life improved.\nThe second theme to emerge from our study was knowl-\nedge and understanding about headaches which showed\nthat many participants had formed their own ideas about\ntheir headaches, which had often led to considerable\nworry, and many were searching for an increased under-\nstanding of their headaches from a variety of sources. In a\nqualitative study of patients decision making for migraine\nand chronic daily headache management Peters et al [17]\nreported similar issues to us. They found that an individ-\nual's knowledge about headaches was acquired through\nthe participant's own and other people's experiences and\nthrough information gathering. Patients sometimes had\nto recognize the limitations of his\/her own ideas for head-\nache management and resort to GP consultation. They\nfound that individuals had sought information from a\nvariety of sources including health professionals, family\nand friends, the media and specialized organisations. Cot-\ntrell et al [15] also found that people with migraines often\nneed more general information about migraines and\nmigraine management. It is clear then that people are\ninterested in understanding more about their headaches\nand securing relevant information about it. This desire for\nfurther information needs greater investigation. The issue\nof worry raised in this study has not been highlighted\nclearly before. Most participants in our study had, at some\npoint, worried, often substantially, that their headaches\nwere caused by serious pathology, even patients who had\nbeen given a formal diagnosis. The fact that participants\nwho had received brain scans stated that their worry had\nreduced and in some cases their headaches had dimin-\nished as a result merits further enquiry.\nThe third theme to emerge focussed on issues about man-\nagement of headaches. We found that most participants\nhad used or were still using a variety of management strat-\negies including conventional, complementary and per-\nsonally developed management techniques and that\nsatisfaction with different management strategies varied\nwidely. Our findings on issues related to management\nwere largely consistent with previous studies [15,17]. Cot-\ntrell et al [15] found that while some of their group mem-\nbers were happy with the medical care they received\nothers reported feeling 'dismissed' by physicians who did\nnot appear to take headaches seriously. In addition they\nfound that headache sufferers were taking responsibility\nfor researching new treatment options including medica-\ntions and alternative treatments. Peters et al [17] found\nsimilar reasons to us for GP consultation with headache\nseverity, patient preferences, previous experience of\nhealthcare services and other people's experiences of\nhealth care all playing a role in management decisions.\nSome of the issues that emerged from our study around\nheadache management have not been investigated in\nqualitative studies of headache, but are consistent with\nqualitative studies of individuals with other chronic con-\nditions, particularly with respect to general practitioner\ninvolvement and medication [23-27]. For example, previ-\nous qualitative studies have clearly highlighted limita-\ntions with the GP consultation, [23-25] while other\nstudies have found that chronic users of medication often\nworry about the side effects of their medication and pos-\nsible drug interactions [26,27]. The full range of manage-\nment techniques used by headache sufferers including\nunconventional techniques developed by the sufferers has\nnot been highlighted before and this needs further inves-\ntigation to optimise appropriate management of head-\nache in the community.Page 9 of 11\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Family Practice 2006, 7:27 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2296\/7\/27Conclusion and future implications\nAn in-depth understanding of the experiences of people\nwith headache is important if we are to develop new treat-\nment or interventions that might reduce the burden of the\ndisorder. This study has highlighted some issues that\nrequire further investigation and provided useful informa-\ntion that might guide the development of such interven-\ntions. For example, the frequent wish to increase\nunderstanding of headache suggests that many people\nwith headache could benefit from detailed information\nabout the causes and management of headaches. Research\nis needed to determine whether such educational strate-\ngies result in beneficial health outcomes. Educational\nstrategies are being developed for patients and health care\nprofessionals, particularly with reference to migraine\n[28,29] and will require future evaluation. Open accessing\nscanning may be a useful intervention to rule out serious\nunderlying pathology and reduce anxiety in headache suf-\nferers. Previous work has shown that a single visit to a\nneurological clinic for headaches not due to structural dis-\nease results in the number of attendances at general prac-\ntice for headache dramatically falling [30,31]. However,\nnumbers have been small and it may be that patients\npresent to general practice just as often, but with different\nsymptoms. There is little evidence that scanning is of any\nuse in non-anxious patients [32] and it is likely therefore\nthat the most cost effective route would be to scan only\nthose who present with anxiety.\nDeclaration of competing interests\nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing inter-\nests.\nAuthors' contributions\nDAL participated in the design of the study, carried out the\ninterviews, conducted the analysis and drafted the manu-\nscript.
