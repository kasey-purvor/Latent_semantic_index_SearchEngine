Let: D = total borrowing by students (\u00a3 million) of which F comes from private financial markets G = student borrowing financed by government Further, let: p = the price at which debt is securitised, as a fraction of the total debt (0<p<1); q = the fraction of student borrowing covered (0<q<1). In model 1: F   = pqD        =  (1)(0.8)(1000) = \u00a3800 million (1) G  = p(1-q)D  =  (1)(0.2)(1000) = \u00a3200 million (2) In equation (1) the private sector pays the full face value of the debt (p=1), but buys the debt of only 80 per cent of students (q = 0.8).  The government buys the debt of the remaining 20 per cent of students (equation (2)). In model 2: F   = pqD      =   (0.8)(1)(1000) = \u00a3800 million (3) G  = D \u2013 F   =    (1\u2013p)qD  =  (0.2)(1)(1000) = \u00a3200 million (4) In equation (3) the private sector buys the debt of all students (q=1), but pays only 80 per cent of the face value of the debt (p=0.8).  The government\u2019s share is the difference between total student borrowing and the amount, F, the market is prepared to pay for it. The central difference, according to the ONS, is that in equation (1), p=1; in equation (3), in contrast, p=0.8.  The government, according to this view, is subsidising the price at which the private sector can buy the debt, as shown by equation (4).  Though the private sector is genuinely financing student borrowing in equation (1), it is not, according to the ONS, doing so in equation (3).","cites":null},{"id":17325197,"title":"Funding Higher Education in an Age of Expansion: Submission to the National Committee","authors":[],"date":"1996","doi":"10.1080\/09645299800000004","raw":"Barr, Nicholas, and Iain Crawford (1996b), \u2018Funding Higher Education in an Age of Expansion: Submission to the National Committee of Inquiry into Higher Education\u2019, Centre for Educational Research, London School of Economics, forthcoming, Education Economics 1998(1).","cites":null},{"id":829225,"title":"Learning to Succeed, Paul Hamlyn Foundation National C o mmi s s i o n on Educat i o n , London : Heinema n n .","authors":[],"date":"1993","doi":null,"raw":null,"cites":null},{"id":17325201,"title":"Learning to Succeed, Paul Hamlyn Foundation National Commission on Education,","authors":[],"date":"1993","doi":null,"raw":"National Education Commission (1993), Learning to Succeed, Paul Hamlyn Foundation National Commission on Education, London: Heinemann.","cites":null},{"id":17325199,"title":"Paying for Learning, London School of Economics, Welfare State Programme, Discussion Paper WSP\/94.","authors":[],"date":"1993","doi":null,"raw":"Barr, Nicholas and Jane Falkingham (1993), Paying for Learning, London School of Economics, Welfare State Programme, Discussion Paper WSP\/94.","cites":null},{"id":17325200,"title":"Repayment Rates for Student Loans: Some Sensitivity Tests, London School of Economics, Welfare State Programme, Discussion Paper WSP\/127.","authors":[],"date":"1996","doi":null,"raw":"Barr, Nicholas, and Jane Falkingham (1996), Repayment Rates for Student Loans: Some Sensitivity Tests,  London School of Economics, Welfare State Programme, Discussion Paper WSP\/127.","cites":null},{"id":829624,"title":"S t u d e n t Loans Compan y","authors":[],"date":"1996","doi":null,"raw":null,"cites":null},{"id":17325195,"title":"Student Loans: Where Are We Now?
