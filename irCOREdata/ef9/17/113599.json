INTRODUCTION\nThe region of near-stable nuclei with A,180 has a num-\nber of specific areas of structural interest, including the pres-\nence of axially deformed, high spin, metastable states. This\nregion is well known to be energetically favorable for high-\nV orbitals1 which when coupled together can give rise to\nparticularly long-lived states of high K [1]. If these states\ncompete energetically with the collective rotational states,\nthey can result in isomeric states with lifetimes ranging from\nnanoseconds up to years (e.g., Refs. [2\u20137]).\nA number of theoretical works have indicated (e.g., Ref.\n[8]) that there are good prospects for finding new, high-spin\nisomers in neutron-rich isotopes which cannot be accessed\nby fusion-evaporation reactions induced by stable-isotope\nbeams. More recent calculations [1,9,10] support this view\nwith quantitative predictions, and there has recently been\nconsiderable experimental success in probing this region us-\ning deep-inelastic [2,11\u201315] and relativistic projectile frag-\nmentation reactions [16\u201322]. However, in only one of these\nexamples has a new K isomer with half-life greater than 1 s\nbeen established, specifically the Kp=8\u2212,t1\/2=48 s isomer in\n184Hf, discovered using the GSI on-line mass separator [11].\n[Note that for long-lived isomeric decays st.10 msd, the\ncorrelation between the ion of interest and the g rays decay-\ning from the isomer is lost in the projectile-fragmentation\nmethod due to the predominance of random background\nevents.]\nThis work describes the results of two experiments per-\nformed to investigate decays in the temporal regime ranging\nfrom seconds to hours for stable and neutron rich A,180\nnuclei using deep-inelastic collisions. The results presented\nin the current work focus specifically on the A=177 isobaric\nchain with particular interest on the production and decay of\n71\n177Lu. The nuclei studied were produced following collisions\nbetween a 136Xe beam provided by the GSI UNILAC accel-\nerator impinging on natural tantalum and enriched 186W tar-\ngets placed in a thermal ion source [23]. The residual ions of\ninterest were extracted from the ion source and mass ana-\nlyzed using the GSI on-line mass separator. This work can be\n*Permanent address: P.O.

Initial\nreports of this work have been published in Refs. [27,28].\nII. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nBeams of 10-50 particle-nA of 136Xe at a laboratory en-\nergy of 11.4 MeV per nucleon were supplied by the GSI\nUNILAC and incident on (i) 40 mg\/cm2 thick enriched 186W\nand (ii) 30 mg\/cm2 thick natural tantalum targets, placed in-\nside thermal ion sources [29,30]. The positively charged re-\naction products resulting from multinucleon transfer and\ndeep-inelastic processes were extracted via a negative polar-\nity extraction voltage of 50 kV and subsequently selected by\nisobars using the GSI mass separator [31,32]. The mass-\nselected beam was taken to the measuring system which in-\nvolved a tape system mounted at one of the beam lines of the\nmass separator. By utilizing a variety of different tape-cycle\nperiods, the removal of unwanted, longer-lived decays was\nachieved.\nIn the first experiment (which will henceforth be referred\nto as the \u201cCluster\u201d experiment), the radiation detection sys-\ntem incorporated a g-ray array which consisted of a seven-\nelement cluster germanium (Ge) detector [33\u201335] together\nwith two standard, coaxial hyperpure germanium detectors\nof 60\u201370 % efficiency relative to a standard NaI(Tl) detec-\ntor. In addition a planar germanium spectrometer was incor-\nporated to increase the detection sensitivity for low-energy g\nand x rays. A plastic scintillator was also used to detect the\nemitted b+, b\u2212, and\/or atomic electrons following internal\nconversion decays. The tape station allowed the removal of\nthe mass-separated source from the b\u2212g detection array at\nthe end of the \u201cgrow-in cycle.\u201d\nIn the second experiment [referred to as the Total Absorp-\ntion Spectrometer (TAS) experiment], the measuring system\nwas composed of two stations. First, a monitor station was\nused which consisted of a large-volume, germanium (Ge)\ng-ray detector, operated in coincidence with a plastic scintil-\nlator for electron detection. The second device, a TAS sta-\ntion, consisted of a large-volume NaI(Tl) TAS [36,37]. A\nsmall-volume Ge detector and a 1 mm thick silicon (Si) de-\ntector, each covering a little under 2p steradian of detection\ngeometry as viewed from the source, were both housed in-\nside the TAS detector. The Ge detector enabled high resolu-\ntion measurement of x rays and low-energy g rays, while the\nsilicon detector was used for the measurement of b particles\nand conversion electrons. Further details of the TAS can be\nfound in Ref. [36]. The mass-selected beam was implanted in\nthe plastic tape, with the resulting radioactive source being\ntransported periodically to the radiation detectors.\nIII. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nVarious targets were bombarded with the 136Xe beams.\nFor specific experiments, a summary of investigated mass\nnumbers, transport tape cycle, and the total run times are\nlisted in Table I.\nA. Cluster experiment\nFigure 1 shows the grow-in g-ray spectra for A=177 us-\ning a tantalum target at three different tape-cycle periods.\nThe shortest tape cycle s160 sd clearly identifies the short-\nlived 105 keV and 518 keV transitions following the ground-\nstate b decay 177Tm\u2192 177Yb [24]. The 1600 and 16 000 s\ntape-cycle spectra shown in Fig. 1 highlight the g-ray lines at\n122, 150, and 1080 keV which correspond to transitions fol-\nlowing the b decay from the longer-lived ground-state decay\nof 177Yb to 177Lu [38].\nThe results obtained from the two longer cycle periods of\n1600 and 16 000 s, shown in Fig. 1, demonstrate a signifi-\ncantly increased number of lines, specifically those coming\nfrom the previously identified Kp=37\/2\u2212 isomer in 177Hf [6]\nwhich has a well established half-life of 51.4\u00b10.5 min [39].\nFigure 2 shows the grow-in curves for the time dependent\ng-ray intensity of the lines associated with this 177Hf isomer\n(i.e., sum of the 214, 277, 295, 312, and 327 keV lines).

The evi-\ndence put forward to support this suggestion is outlined be-\nlow.\n(i) The clear observation of lines from the Kp= 372\n\u2212 isomer\nin 177Hf is at odds with the fact that the release of refractory\nelements such as hafnium is expected to be suppressed from\na thermal ion source.\n(ii) The measured single-component (apparent) half-life\nfor the 177Hf Kp=37\/2\u2212 isomer of 76\n\u22129\n+16 min is inconsistent\nat the .2s level with the previous measurements for this\ndecay of t1\/2=51.4\u00b10.5 min.\nIn order to investigate the suggestion that direct release of\nhafnium isotopes is highly suppressed, two other settings\nwere analyzed in detail, namely those involving the mass-\nseparated A=178 and 182 secondary beams. These were cho-\nsen in order to search for the direct population (or otherwise)\nof isomeric sKp=8\u2212d states in hafnium nuclei.\nThe specific decays of interest were the long-lived Kp\n=8\u2212 isomeric states in 178Hf [4] and 182Hf [6,23,41] which\nhave intrinsic half-lives of 4 s and 61.5 min, respectively.\nNote that while the Kp=8\u2212 isomeric state in 178Hf can be fed\nfrom the b decay of the Kp=9\u2212 low-lying state in the 178Lu\nmother nucleus [42], this scenario does not seem to be valid\nfor the 182Hf isomer (see Fig. 3.)\nFigure 4 displays the g-ray spectrum for mass 178, using\nthe tantalum target in a thermal ion source with an 800 s tape\ncycle. This spectrum clearly shows the lines deexciting the\nKp=8\u2212 isomer in 178Hf which are characterized by g-ray\nenergies of 89, 93, 213, 326, and 426 keV. The half-life de-\n2A constant 136Xe primary beam intensity and constant TIS per-\nformance over the entire measuring period are required for the ap-\nplication of this fitting procedure to be valid. The current data were\nonly taken for a single 16 000 s cycle. A variation in primary beam\nintensity might be averaged out if many cycles had been taken.\nHowever we also note that the count rate of the short-lived 177Tm\nactivity (105 keV transition) remained steady throughout for the\ncurrent data.\nFIG. 2. Single-lifetime grow-in fit for g rays assigned to the\nKp=37\/2\u2212 isomer in 177Hf (214, 277, 295, 312, and 327 keV) from\nthe Cluster experiment. The inset shows the x2 values for single\ndecay component grow-in fit of the decays from Kp=37\/2\u2212 isomer\nin 177Hf, with the asymptotic value allowed to vary to the minimum\nvalue for each half-life value. A best fit for a fixed half-life of\n51.4 min is also shown for comparison. This analysis gives a mini-\nmum value for the single-component decay for these data of t1\/2\n=76\n\u22129\n+16 min.\nFIG. 1. Cluster array g-ray spectra for A\n=177 using the tantalum target.

The total collec-\ntion times were 599, 321, and 215 min for the\n160, 1600, and 16 000 s cycles, respectively. The\nlabels indicate the nuclei which the g-ray transi-\ntions decay in.\nEVIDENCE FOR A HIGH-SPIN b-DECAYING ISOMER IN 177Lu PHYSICAL REVIEW C 69, 024320 (2004)\n024320-3\nduced for the sum of the grow-in curves of these five transi-\ntions yields a value of t1\/2=23s1d min, assuming a single-\ncomponent decay constant. This result, shown in Fig. 5, is\nconsistent with the feeding of the 178Hf isomer by the 178Lu\nb decay with T1\/2<23.1 min [42].\nFigure 6 displays the g-ray spectrum obtained for A\n=182, where the lines fed by the (low spin) b\u2212 decay of\n182Lu are observed, but no obvious direct population of the\nK=8\u2212 isomer is present. (Note the absence of the transitions\nat 344 and 456 keV corresponding to the yrast 6+\u21924+ and\n8+\u21926+ transitions in 182Hf, respectively [6,41].) The half-\nlife deduced from the grow-in curve gives a value of\n2.30\u00b10.25 min as shown in Fig. 7, consistent with the pub-\nlished value for the half-life of the ground state b\u2212 decay of\n182Lu of t1\/2=2.0\u00b10.2 min [23]. As Fig. 6 also demonstrates,\nthere is no evidence for the population of the Kp=8\u2212 isomer\nst1\/2=61.5 mind in 182Hf [6,41], via a low-lying, high spin\nb\u2212-decaying state in 182Lu. The obvious lack of direct popu-\nlation of the 182Hf Kp=8\u2212 isomer is consistent with the con-\nclusion that the release of hafnium ions from the thermal ion\nsource used in the current experiment was highly suppressed,\nstrengthening the argument that the 177Hf Kp=37\/2\u2212 isomer\nis actually fed by a b-decaying state in 177Lu.\nTwo methods of analysis were undertaken to determine\nthe lifetime of the b\u2212-decaying 177Lum2 state itself and to\nidentify any internal decay branches from the proposed Kp\n=39\/2\u2212 state in 177Lu to lower-lying states in this nucleus via\ng decay. (The spin\/parity assignment for the proposed state\nin 177Lu will be discussed in the following section.)\nThe first method made use of a two-component fit to the\ngrow-in curve for the observed g-ray intensities from the\nKp=37\/2\u2212 isomer in 177Hf, fixing the half-life of the lower\n(Kp=37\/2\u2212 isomeric) state to the published value of t1\/2\n=51.4 min.\nThe expression for the grow-in rate R for a two-\ncomponent grow-in is given by\nR = A 3 frs1 \u2212 e\u2212l1td \u2212 sr \u2212 1ds1 \u2212 e\u2212l2tdg , s3.1d\nwhere A is a constant, r=l2 \/ sl2\u2212l1d, l1 is the decay con-\nstant of the higher-lying state, and l2 is the decay constant of\nthe lower-lying state.\nUsing this expression, the grow-in of the data shown in\nFig. 2 were fitted to the two-component expression given\nabove. The result is shown in Fig. 8. By fixing the value of\nl2 to a value corresponding to a half-life of the lower state\n(177Hf Kp=37\/2\u2212) of 51.4 min, a value of t1\/2=6 min can be\nextracted for the higher-lying decay component. A x2 mini-\nmization for the lifetime of the upper level using this two-\ncomponent technique is shown in Fig. 9, yielding a best fit\nvalue of 6\n\u22122\n+3 min for the proposed state.\nThe application of the two-component-decay formula is\nbased on the premise of a constant lutetium production and\nprompt release from the ion source. In previous work, the\nrelease properties of lutetium from a thermal ion source have\nbeen measured [43] and affected the decay constants in ex-\npression (3.1). Due to the uncertainties in the original\npremise for this analysis due to the release properties of the\nion source, a second, independent method to determine the\nhalf-life of the proposed higher-lying decay was used. This\nsecond method was used to search for internal decays in\nFIG. 4. g-ray spectrum for the A=178 setting with a tape cycle\nof 800 s for the tantalum target from the Cluster experiment. Note\nthe clear identification of lines following the decay from the t1\/2\n=4 s,Kp=8\u2212 isomer in 178Hf [42], which is populated by the b\ndecay of the Kp=9\u2212 state in 178Lu.\nFIG. 5.

In particular, we have evaluated the in-\ntensity ratio for the b-delayed g rays of 70\n177Yb st1\/2\n=1.911 hd by comparing the spectra accumulated during the\n1600 and 16 000 s tape cycles.

We note the shorter half-life\nof 85 s for the transitions associated with the 69177Tm\n\u2192 70177Yb decay which have a much lower weighted mean of\n0.83 for this intensity ratio.\nIn Fig. 11, four previously unreported transitions with en-\nergies of 413, 1003, 1292, and 1327 keV (labeled with ?)\nwere identified with ratios corresponding to decay half-lives\nin the few minutes regime, consistent with the estimated\nhalf-life of 6\n\u22122\n+3 min min for the decay of the proposed Kp\n=39\/2\u2212 state in 177Lu. Since the decay of such a state to the\nKp=37\/2\u2212 state in 177Hf could proceed by a direct allowed\nGamow-Teller sDI=1,Dp=0d b decay, one would expect on\nthe basis of phase space arguments that most of the decay\ngoes directly to the Kp=37\/2\u2212 isomer.

These two ex-\namples illustrate how individual g-ray peaks appear in the\nTAS spectra. The energy of the peak as determined from the\nTAS spectrum in the lower panel of Fig. 15 (in coincidence\nwith the 89 keV g-ray line) is 999\u00b14 keV.\nNote that the 1003 keV peak was also observed in the\nCluster experiment (see Fig. 1) and was identified there as a\ntransition of potential interest with regard to the hypothetical\n177Lu high-K isomer decay. Gating on the 1003 keV transi-\ntion in the TAS, the 89 keV transition is clearly present in the\ncoincident Ge spectrum. Figure 16 illustrates that the 89 keV\ntransition is associated with hafnium Ka x rays. Furthermore,\nthe x-ray intensity, relative to the 89 keV g-ray intensity,\nimplies a small electron-conversion coefficient, and hence\nE1 character for the 89 keV transition. The experimental aK\nvalue of 0.42\u00b10.15 derived from x-ray to g-ray intensity\nratio for the 89 keV transition is consistent with the theoret-\nical value of aKsE1d=0.40 [46].\nWe conclude that the 89 and 1003 keV transitions are in\ncoincidence, and that they are associated with internal decays\nin 177Hf. A single-component exponential fit was applied to\nthe time characteristic of the intensity of the 89 keV events\nrecorded by the small Ge detector in coincidence with the\nTAS. The result is shown in Fig. 17, yielding a half-life of\n7.7\u00b13.0 min. The conclusion from these data is that either (i)\nthere is a new g-decaying isomer in 177Hf, or (ii) there is a\npreviously unreported b-decaying isomer in 177Lu.\nThe Si-detector spectra displayed in Fig. 18 support the\nscenario of b decay from a 177Lum2 level. The upper panel\nshows the electron events in the Si detector gated by the\n89 keV transition in the Ge detector. As expected, there is no\nstrong electron-conversion component associated with the\n1003 keV transition (see upper panel of Fig. 18.) Rather\nthere is a distribution of low-energy events above the energy\nthreshold of <140 keV, suggesting a population via b decay.\nBy contrast, the lower panel of Fig. 18 gives an example of\nknown low-energy discrete electron-conversion (K and L)\ntransitions that were recorded in the Si detector and are as-\nsociated with transitions in 177Yb from an excited state [38].\nIf we consider the hypothesis of a 177Lu b decay to be cor-\nrect, then the b end point (in coincidence with the 89 keV\ng-ray transition) is evidently no more than 650 keV (see Fig.\n18, upper panel) and most of the b particles would have\nenergies below the detection threshold of the electron detec-\nFIG. 12.

The displayed spectrum in the lower panel of\nFig. 15 is most easily explained by using the scheme shown\nin Fig. 19, with implied partial b\u2212 feeding through other\n(unobserved) g-ray transitions with energies less than\n1003 keV. This explanation is supported by the intensity\nmeasurements for the 89 keV transition following the b de-\ncay of the proposed 177Lu, Kp=39\/2\u2212 isomer, and for the\n214 keV transition following the internal decay of the Kp\n=37\/2\u2212 isomer in 177Hf. The relative intensity measurements\nare given in Table III.\nGating on the 1003 keV transition in the TAS does not\nyield any significant coincident events in the Si detector,\nwhich means that there is no evidence for direct b-decay\nbranch to the intermediate state. However, the absence of this\ndecay could be due to the poor statistics or could imply that\nthe b transition is forbidden by spin\/parity selection rules.\nThe spin and parity assignments are discussed in the follow-\ning section.\nIt is also worth noting that the half-life determined for the\npopulation of the 89 keV transition, as observed by the small\nGe detector in the TAS experiment st1\/2=7.7\u00b13.0 mind, is\nconsistent with that obtained from the Cluster experiment for\nthe first component, 6\n\u22122\n+3 min, of the two-component \u201cgrow-\nin\u201d curve for 177Hfm2.\nThe placement of the proposed 177Lu Kp=39\/2\u2212 isomer\ndepends on the various factors, presented above, being con-\nsistent with such an isomer populating the 51 min 177Hfm2\nKp=37\/2\u2212 state, at an energy of 2740 keV (relative to the\n177Hf ground state.) If the isomer were of lower angular mo-\nmentum, it would be difficult to understand why no coinci-\ndences with previously reported g-ray transitions in 177Hf\n[52,49] were observed in our measurement.

The candidate electron\nenergies are indicated with their energies in keV, taking into ac-\ncount the detector threshold of <140 keV and hafnium and ytter-\nbium K- and L-binding energies of 65 and 61 keV, and 11 and\n10 keV, respectively.\nEVIDENCE FOR A HIGH-SPIN b-DECAYING ISOMER IN 177Lu PHYSICAL REVIEW C 69, 024320 (2004)\n024320-9\n=21.50\/A MeV and Gspd=22.50\/A MeV [9], are shown in\nFig. 20. These calculations predict an energetically favored\nstate which is consistent with the well established Kp\n=23\/2\u2212 b-decaying isomer (t1\/2=160 days) [47,48]. The pre-\ndicted excitation energy of Ex=1.0 MeV is in excellent\nagreement with the observed value of 0.97 MeV. This iso-\nmeric state decays by both external b\u2212 s78%d and internal g\nrays and internal conversion s22%d branches [47]. It has\nbeen suggested that the Nilsson configuration of the Kp\n=23\/2\u2212 isomer in 177Lu is a three-quasiparticle arrangement\ncomprising p 72\n+f404g ^ nh 92\n+f624g ^ 72\n\u2212f514gj [48]. Notably,\nthis is the same configuration as that predicted by the\nblocked BCS calculations.\nThe configuration-constrained potential energy surface\n(PES) obtained by the method described in Ref. [10] for the\nKp=37\/2\u2212 isomeric state in 177Hf is shown in Fig. 21. In\nlight of the previous discussion of a possible b\u2212-decaying\nisomer feeding this state, it is interesting to note that the\nblocked BCS calculations also predict an energetically fa-\nvored higher lying five-quasiparticle state with Kp=39\/2\u2212 in\n177Lu. The predicted Nilsson configuration for this state\nis ph 72\n+f404g ^ 92\n\u2212f514g ^ 72\n\u2212f523gj ^ nh 72\n\u2212f514g ^ 92\n+f624gj.\nThe corresponding PES for this configuration is shown in\nFig. 21.\nThe population of such a state would be consistent with\nthe observed results for the 177Hf isomer if there was a DK\n=1, b\u2212 decay (which could proceed via an allowed Gamow-\nTeller decay), between the predicted Kp=39\/2\u2212 state in\n177Lu and the well established Kp=37\/2\u2212 st1\/2=51.4 mind\nisomer in 177Hf. The suggested Nilsson configuration of the\nKp=37\/2\u2212 state in 72\n177Hf is ph 72\n+f404g ^ 92\n\u2212f514gj\n^ nh 72\n\u2212f514g ^ 92\n+f624g ^ 52\n\u2212f512gj [39]. This would be con-\nsistent with the proposed b\u2212 decay from the Kp=39\/2\u2212 state\nin 71\n177Lu proceeding via transforming the configuration from\np\n7\n2\n\u2212f523g\u2192n 52\n\u2212f512g.\nFor this to be a valid explanation, the internal electromag-\nnetic decay within 177Lu from the proposed Kp=39\/2\u2212 state\nmust be highly hindered, otherwise one would expect that it\nshould also have been observed in the current work. The\ncalculations shown in Fig. 20 suggest that the next lowest-\nenergy intrinsic state sKp=33\/2+d lies just below the Kp\n=39\/2\u2212 state. A simple parity changing, DK=3 spin differ-\nence between these two states would be unlikely to produce\nsuch a transition (i.e., an E3 transition), long enough lived\nfor b\u2212 decay to compete with g-ray emission. However, if\nthe predicted Kp=33\/2+ state lies closer to, or even above,\nthe predicted Kp=39\/2\u2212 state, the latter may form a yrast\ntrap, which subsequently decays to states built on the Kp\n=23\/2\u2212 state sDK=8d or the predicted 25\/2+ state sDK=7d.\nNote that, to date, no rotational transitions built on the Kp\n=23\/2\u2212, t1\/2=160 day isomer have been reported in the lit-\nerature. In this way, the lack of internal 177Lu decays are\ninterpreted here to be a consequence of the conservation of\nthe K quantum number, with large-DK transitions being\nhighly retarded [50]. In contrast, the b decay to 177Hf is\ninterpreted as being \u201cK allowed,\u201d with DK=1. Since the g\ndecay is K inhibited, it could be said that the b decay is \u201cK\ndriven.\u201d\nFIG. 19.

Analysis of logft values\nOne of the approaches to investigate the permissibility of\nany b decay is to calculate the log ft value of the particular\ntransition and see how hindered or allowed it is. The log ft\nvalue [51] is determined by the partial half-life, the decay\nenergy Eb\u2212 of the transition, and the atomic number of the\ndaughter nucleus. Table IV presents the log ft values for the\n177Lu b-decay feeding into the Kp=37\/2+ isomer through\nthe 89 and 1003 keV transitions (marked as b1), in addition\nto the other (possible) direct b feeding to the 37\/2\u2212 isomer\nsb2d The log ft values for the well-known Kp=23\/2\u2212 isomer\nand the 177Lu ground state have been calculated and agree\nwith the published values [52].\n2. Spin and parity assignments\nTo assign the spins and parities for the states depopulating\nvia the 89 and 1003 keV transitions, the log ft value for the\nstate decaying by the 89 keV transition has been calculated\n(see Table IV.) The calculated value is indicative of an al-\nlowed transition which means no parity change. For the\n89 keV decay, the experimental aK value of 0.42\u00b10.15 is\nconsistent only with the theoretical value for an electric di-\npole decay (see the preceding section). This assignment then\nalso constrains the 1003 keV transition to have E1 character\nin order to terminate at the Kp=37\/2\u2212,t1\/2=51 min isomer.\nV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\nWe have presented the results obtained in two experi-\nments using collisions between a 136Xe beam with tungsten\nand tantalum targets and on-line mass separation with the\naim of identifying new, high spin isomers in neutron-rich\nnuclei with A<180. In the first experiment g rays associated\nwith the decay of the well established Kp=37\/2\u2212,t1\/2\n=51.4 min isomer in 177Hf were observed with an unexpect-\nedly high yield and an apparent difference in the measured\nhalf-life st1\/2=76\n\u22129\n+16 mind compared to the published value.\nThese phenomena are presented as potential evidence for a\nhigher-lying, b-decaying isomeric state in 177Lu which popu-\nlates the Kp=37\/2\u2212 state in 177Hf.\nIf the second, lower-lying component is fixed at the pub-\nlished value of 51.4 min, a two-component half-life analysis\nof the 177Hf g rays following the decay of the Kp=37\/2\u2212\nisomer gives an estimate of 6\n\u22122\n+3 min for the shorter-lived\ncomponent. This agrees well with the half-life of\n7.7\u00b13.0 min observed in the TAS experiment. The weighted\naverage half-life for both experiments is 7\u00b12 min. Both sce-\nnarios are consistent with the multi-quasiparticle and PES\ncalculations which predict a favored Kp=39\/2\u2212 five-\nquasiparticle state in 177Lu.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by the EPSRC(UK) and the EU\naccess to Large Scale Facilities scheme.
