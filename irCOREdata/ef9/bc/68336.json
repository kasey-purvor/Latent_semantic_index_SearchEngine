P. Borgia, Springer, Berlin, 2006, pp. xi + 291. A volume in Patrick Moore\u2019s Practical\nAstronomy Series. Scope: handbook. Level: amateur astronomer.\nAstronomy is perhaps the only science left where amateurs can still make important\ndiscoveries. As Borgia points out in his introduction, it was amateurs who discovered e.g.\nthe Hale-Bopp, Hayakutake, West and Ikeya-Seki comets. They continue to make highly\nsignificant contributions. One reason is the sheer immensity of the heavens, and another\nis that the attention of most professional astronomers is currently focussed on non-visible\nwavelengths. Consequently, most major discoveries at optical wavelengths are now being\nmade by amateurs.\nThe aim of Borgia\u2019s book is to train them in observing, so that they can optimse their\nperformance and thus exploit these opportunities to maximum advantage. His intention\nis to develop in each case what he calls an \u201cintegrated observing system\u201d consisting of\nthree distinct elements that have to work closely and harmoniously if success is to be\nachieved: the observer\u2019s eyes, equipment and brain. He discusses each of these elements\nin turn. He treats the eyes as instruments, including discussions of how they work, the\nreason why averted vision can be an advantage at very low light levels, the effect of\nhypoxia, and optical corrections to vision. The second chapter deals with equipment,\ndiscussing what is feasible at an amateur level, and the third puts everything together.\nThe rest of the book takes the reader on a grand tour of the universe, starting from the\nMoon, and moving out from there to take in e.g. the Sun, Mercury, Venus, Mars, comets\nand asteroids, Jupiter, Saturn, the outer planets, stars including binaries and variables,\nglobular clusters, nebulae, and galaxies. Each topic is first discussed in scientific terms,\nfollowed by practical details of how to conduct the observations. There are numerous\nimages recorded by the author using his own equipment. There are thus enough projects\nhere to exercise the third element of the integrated observing system for a lifetime.\nAlthough the book is supposedly intended for neither beginners nor experts, I believe\nthat beginners will find it immensely useful once they get into it, and that experts too will\nfind ideas and nuggets of information that are new to them. It is mostly very well written,\nin a friendly non-technical style that only very occasionally tips over into condescension.\nI believe that the author has succeeded admirably in his declared aim of enabling readers\n\u201c...to learn how to see\u201d the night sky.\nPeter V.
