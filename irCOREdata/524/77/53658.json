Samples were collected from Arma\u00e7\u00e3o Nova Bay, Mareta Beach, Cilheta 19 \nBeach and the Carrapateira outlier. At Arma\u00e7\u00e3o Nova Bay the Upper Pliensbachian-20 \nLower Toarcian succession proved barren, or yielded sparse, non age-diagnostic 21 \npalynomorphs. Dinoflagellate cysts are confined to the Upper Bajocian to Upper 22 \nCallovian sedimentary rocks exposed at Mareta and Cilheta beaches and the Lower 23 \nKimmeridgian strata of the Carrapateira outlier. At Mareta Beach, the Upper Bajocian, 24 \nBathonian and Callovian produced relatively low to moderate diversity dinoflagellate 25 \ncyst assemblages. Several key bioevents confirm the Bathonian and Callovian ages of 26 \nthe succession; no age-significant Late Bajocian bioevents were noted. The Upper 27 \nCallovian of Cilheta Beach yielded moderately diverse dinoflagellate cyst associations 28 \n 2 \ndominated by Ctenidodinium spp. Key Late Callovian bioevents confirm the age of this 29 \nsuccession. Many familiar marker forms known from northwest Europe were not 30 \nencountered. No typically Arctic forms were recovered throughout the Upper Bajocian 31 \nto Callovian of this part of the Algarve Basin. It is clear that there was no significant 32 \nLate Bajocian to Late Callovian dinoflagellate cyst provincialism within southern and 33 \nnorthern Europe and adjacent regions. The Carrapateira outlier yielded a moderately 34 \ndiverse Early Kimmeridgian dinoflagellate cyst flora. The Early Kimmeridgian age 35 \nassessment based on corals and foraminifera is confirmed. Amphorula and Histiophora 36 \nare present; these are typical of the Late Jurassic of the Tethyan Realm, and their 37 \npresence is consistent with Late Jurassic provincialism within Europe. The relatively 38 \nlow diversity nature of these Late Bajocian to Lower Kimmeridgian dinoflagellate cyst 39 \nfloras is probably mainly due to the relatively deep water, partially enclosed 40 \ndepositional setting. The partially enclosed nature of this part of the Algarve Basin and 41 \nthe Carrapateira outlier seems to have prevented the free migration of dinoflagellates 42 \nbetween southern Portugal and elsewhere in Europe. 43 \n 44 \nKeywords: biostratigraphy; palynology; Jurassic; Algarve Basin; Carrapateira outlier; 45 \nPortugal 46 \n 47 \n1. Introduction 48 \n 49 \n The Algarve Basin is an important Mesozoic depocentre in southern Portugal 50 \n(Fig. 1). It is located south of the Palaeozoic-dominated \u201cSerra Algarvia\u201d and mainly 51 \ncomprises Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous limestones. This maritime region is locally 52 \nknown as the \u2018Barrocal\u2019 and the carbonate-dominated lithologies have given rise to 53 \ngentle karst topography with west-east aligned fold axes and faults. The basin extends 54 \nfrom Cape Saint Vincent in the west to the Guadiana River on the Portuguese-Spanish 55 \nborder in the east (Fig. 1). In the western part of the basin, the Upper Triassic, Jurassic 56 \nand Lower Cretaceous succession is superbly exposed in sea cliffs between Cape Saint 57 \nVincent and Lagos. The Jurassic outcrops of the Carrapateira outlier, located around 20 58 \nkm north of Sagres (Fig. 1), represent a northerly extension of the Algarve Basin. 59 \n 3 \n This sedimentary basin was initiated by rifting associated with the opening of 60 \nthe North and Central Atlantic Ocean, following the breakup of Pangea. However, due 61 \nto its location, the Algarve Basin was also influenced by the formation of the Neo-62 \nTethys Ocean. The evidence for a Tethyan influence is largely from the dominance of 63 \nsub-Mediterranean Late Pliensbachian to Tithonian ammonite faunas (Rocha, 1976). 64 \nTypically boreal ammonites (Amaltheidea) did migrate southwards into the Algarve 65 \nBasin during the Late Pliensbachian, however they never became dominant (Rocha, 66 \n1976). Furthermore, Late Sinemurian benthic foraminifera with Tethyan affinities 67 \nrepresent further evidence that the Algarve Basin was part of the Tethyan Realm during 68 \nthe Early Jurassic (Azer\u00eado et al., 2003). 69 \n Short term compressional phases within the broad extensional framework 70 \noccurred during the Jurassic in the Algarve Basin (Terrinha et al., 2002). These tectonic 71 \nevents may have at least partially isolated the basin thereby preventing the mixing of 72 \nTethyan and boreal faunas, especially during the Toarcian-Aalenian and the Callovian-73 \nOxfordian intervals. The Algarve Basin thus straddled the Tethyan and boreal 74 \npalaeogeographical realms, making it an extremely important depocentre in terms of the 75 \nJurassic biogeography in Western Europe. 76 \n Lateral facies changes across the Algarve Basin, allow its division into the 77 \nWestern (Sagres), the Budens-Lagoa, and the Eastern (Faro) subbasins (Manuppella et 78 \nal., 1988; Fig. 1). These relatively small depocentres are separated by major regional 79 \nfaults which were probably active during deposition. Sedimentation in the Algarve 80 \nBasin commenced with Upper Triassic continental red beds and evaporites which 81 \nunconformably overlie Upper Palaeozoic strata (Palain, 1976). These Upper Triassic 82 \nstrata are overlain by Early Jurassic (Hettangian) volcanic rocks associated with the 83 \nCentral Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP). Following this important magmatic 84 \nevent, Sinemurian to Tithonian marine carbonate sedimentation became well-85 \nestablished across the Algarve basin. The dominant lithofacies are shallow water 86 \nlimestones and cycles of pelagic marls and limestones. The Lower Cretaceous is 87 \nrepresented by a mixed clastic and carbonate succession, deposited in nearshore and 88 \nterrestrial settings (Rey, 2006). During the Late Cretaceous, a major basin inversion 89 \nevent occurred, related to Alpine tectonism and the emplacement of the Late Cretaceous 90 \n(Campanian, ca. 72 Ma) syenite of Monchique into Upper Palaeozoic strata (Terrinha et 91 \nal., 2002; Miranda et al., 2009). Therefore, no Upper Cretaceous strata are present in the 92 \n 4 \nAlgarve Basin. Sedimentation resumed during the Miocene with bioclastic limestones 93 \nwhich unconformably overlie the Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous succession. 94 \n Palynological studies of the Mesozoic of the Algarve Basin are largely on the 95 \nLower Cretaceous (e.g. Berthou and Leereveld, 1990; Heimhofer et al., 2003; 2007). 96 \nThere are only two published reports of Jurassic palynomorphs from the Algarve Basin. 97 \nThe first was Fechner (1989), on the Lower Jurassic salt diapir at Loul\u00e9; the second is a 98 \nbrief description of the Middle Jurassic palynofloras of Mareta Beach by Oliveira et al. 99 \n(2009). The present contribution is a preliminary account of the Pliensbachian to 100 \nKimmeridgian palynology of the Algarve Basin near Sagres and in the Carrapateira 101 \noutlier. Davies (1985), Mohr and Schmidt (1988), Smelror et al. (1991), Smelror 102 \n(1993), Bucefalo Palliani and Riding (1999; 2003) and Oliveira et al. (2007) 103 \ndocumented the Sinemurian to Kimmeridgian palynology of the Lusitanian Basin, west-104 \ncentral Portugal. 105 \n 106 \n2. Geological background 107 \n 108 \n The Sagres region is the reference area for the Mesozoic fill of the Western 109 \nsubbasin. Jurassic strata outcrop spectacularly in the cliffs between Cape Saint Vincent 110 \nand Mareta Bay (Fig. 2). The Jurassic stratigraphy and palaeontology of the Sagres area 111 \nwas described by Choffat (1887) and Rocha (1976). 112 \n The Lower Jurassic is well-represented at Cape Saint Vincent and Arma\u00e7\u00e3o 113 \nNova (Fig. 2). At Cape Saint Vincent, an extensive (>30 m) ?Sinemurian to Lower 114 \nPliensbachian carbonate-dominated succession is organic-lean, probably due to the 115 \nintensely dolomitised nature of these beds. A well-exposed Lower Toarcian succession 116 \napproximately 35 m thick occurs at Arma\u00e7\u00e3o Nova Bay, 1 km northeast of Cape Saint 117 \nVincent (Fig. 2). The base consists of intensely dolomitised limestones, of probable 118 \nLate Pliensbachian age, passing upwards to interbedded marls and bioclastic limestones 119 \n(Fig. 3). The bases of the limestone beds exhibit normal grading, longitudinal scours 120 \nand flute casts, and the tops are rich in Zoophycos traces. The scour casts and the 121 \nbioclastic character of the limestone beds suggest that they represent turbidites, however 122 \nevidence of bioturbation mitigates against this interpretation. 123 \n 5 \n Middle Jurassic strata are well exposed at Mareta Bay (Figs. 2, 4). The base of 124 \nthe succession consists of coral bioherms with karstified tops. There are no marker 125 \nfossils in the bioherms; however the karst cavities are filled and covered by Upper 126 \nBajocian bioclastic limestones and Middle Bathonian marls. This indicates that the 127 \nkarstification was pre-Late Bajocian, and that the bioherms are therefore of Aalenian to 128 \nEarly Bajocian age. At beach level there is a conglomerate which overlies the bioherms. 129 \nThis is dominated by limestone clasts and these include clasts of the bioherms. The 130 \nconglomerate is coeval with the palaeokarstification event, and exhibits lateral thickness 131 \nchanges. Overlying the conglomerate is a ca. 8 m thick succession of Upper Bajocian 132 \nlimestones with Zoophycos (see Rocha, 1976). The youngest strata are a 120 m thick 133 \nsuccession of grey marls that grade into marly limestones which have been affected by 134 \nseveral slump events (Fig. 4). Ammonite faunas indicate a Callovian age (Rocha, 1976). 135 \n Following the deposition of the Callovian strata a tectonic event, observed 136 \nthroughout Iberia, folded the Middle Jurassic succession. This is observed at Cilheta 137 \nBeach, where Upper Jurassic limestones rest unconformably on gently-folded Callovian 138 \nmarly limestones and marls (Figs. 2, 5). Above the unconformity is a highly 139 \nfossiliferous matrix-supported conglomerate with ammonites indicative of the Middle 140 \nOxfordian Plicatilis Chronozone. This bed is overlain by 200 m of Upper Jurassic 141 \ninterbedded limestones, marls and dolomite (Fig. 5). 142 \n The Carrapateira outlier is located around 20 km north of Sagres, and preserves 143 \nan Upper Triassic to Upper Jurassic succession which is closely genetically related to 144 \nthe fill of the Algarve Basin. The base of this succession outcrops at the northern part of 145 \nAmado Beach and consists of Upper Triassic-Lower Jurassic red fluviatile sandstones 146 \nand claystones that grade into limestones (Figs. 2, 6). These Lower and Middle Jurassic 147 \nlimestones are strongly dolomitised and have proved devoid of palynomorphs. 148 \nHowever, the 50 m of Upper Jurassic interbedded limestones and marls at Tr\u00eas Angras 149 \nis undolomitised (Ribeiro et al., 1987). Bioclastic limestones and conglomerates pass 150 \ninto interbedded marls and limestones (Fig. 6). The uppermost limestone beds are rich 151 \nin macrofossils including well-preserved corals in life position. The macrofauna 152 \nindicates an Early Kimmeridgian age (Ribeiro et al., 1987). 153 \n 154 \n 155 \n 6 \n3. Material and methods 156 \n 157 \n All the samples in this study were collected from outcrops at Arma\u00e7\u00e3o Nova 158 \nBay, Mareta Beach, Cilheta Beach and the Carrapateira outlier (Figs. 2-6). They were 159 \nprepared using standard palynological processing techniques involving acid digestion 160 \n(Wood et al., 1996). The organic residue was sieved using a 15 \u00b5m mesh sieve and the 161 \npalynomorph concentrates were mounted on slides using Entellan\u00ae resin. All sample 162 \nmaterials, slides and figured specimens are housed in the collections of the LGM\/LNEG 163 \n(Portugese Geological Survey), S. Mamede Infesta, Portugal. 164 \n 165 \n4. Palynology 166 \n 167 \n Palynomorphs from Lower Jurassic (Upper Pliensbachian-Lower Toarcian), 168 \nMiddle Jurassic (Upper Bajocian, Bathonian and Callovian) and Upper Jurassic (Lower 169 \nKimmeridgian) strata from four localities in southwest Portugal were studied (Figs. 3-170 \n6). The assemblages recovered are described and interpreted in this section. Selected 171 \ndinoflagellate cysts are illustrated in Plate 1. The author citations and references 172 \npertaining to the dinoflagellate cysts can be found in Appendices 1 and 2 and Fensome 173 \nand Williams (2004) respectively. 174 \n 175 \n4.1. Arma\u00e7\u00e3o Nova Bay 176 \n Fourteen samples were collected from the Lower Jurassic outcrops at Arma\u00e7\u00e3o 177 \nNova Bay, 1 km north east of Cape Saint Vincent (Fig. 3). Note that five samples (A9 178 \nthrough A13) were taken from the marly limestone bed at ca. 27 m. This succession is 179 \nconsidered to be of Late Pliensbachian to Early Toarcian age (Rocha, 1976). These beds 180 \nare devoid of palynomorphs due to their highly dolomitic nature and winnowing effects 181 \nduring deposition. The uppermost beds are less dolomitised and are correlated to the 182 \nTenuicostatum Chronozone (largely the Semicelatum Subchronozone) (Fig. 3). These 183 \nsamples (A6-A16) proved extremely palynologically sparse. Acanthomorph acritarchs 184 \n 7 \n(Micrhystridium spp.) and miospores were recorded in extremely low proportions. The 185 \norganic residues are dominated by resistant mineral grains and fragments of black 186 \nwood. Dinoflagellate cysts proved absent, hence it is not possible to effect comparisons 187 \nwith the low diversity Late Pliensbachian assemblages recorded from the Lusitanian 188 \nBasin by Oliveira et al. (2007). 189 \n 190 \n4.2. Mareta Beach 191 \n 192 \n The coastal cliff exposures at Mareta Beach, south of Sagres (Figs. 1, 2) 193 \nrepresent an important reference section. A composite, sporadically fossiliferous 194 \nsuccession of interbedded limestones and marls >140 m thick is exposed (Fig. 4). This 195 \nsection was assigned to the Late Bajocian to ?Late Oxfordian\/Kimmeridgian by Choffat 196 \n(1887) and Rocha (1976). Forty-nine samples were collected from this succession (Fig. 197 \n4, Table 1). The palynofloras were briefly described by Oliveira et al. (2009). This 198 \nsample set is viewed as preliminary; more samples will be studied in future. 199 \n The palynomorph assemblages are outlined in Table 1. The residues which 200 \nproved productive are relatively abundant and include moderately well-preserved 201 \npalynomorphs and dark woody phytoclasts. Pollen and spores are consistently the 202 \ndominant palynomorph group, with marine microplankton (i.e. acritarchs, dinoflagellate 203 \ncysts, foraminiferal test linings and prasinophytes) being subordinate. The miospore 204 \nassemblages are relatively consistent throughout this succession and include bisaccate 205 \npollen, Callialasporites dampieri, Callialasporites turbatus, Callialasporites spp., 206 \nClassopollis classoides, Cyathidites spp., Ischyosporites variegatus, Leptolepidites spp., 207 \nPerinopollenites elatoides and Sestrosporites pseudoalveolatus (Table 1). 208 \n 209 \n4.2.1 Late Bajocian 210 \n Four samples were studied from the Late Bajocian. Samples M1 and M14 211 \nproved barren and virtually devoid of palynomorphs respectively. By contrast, samples 212 \nM19 and M15 yielded workable assemblages (Table 1). Sample M19 proved richest in 213 \npalynomorphs. Dinoflagellate cysts recognised include Ctenidodinium cornigerum, the 214 \n 8 \nCtenidodinium sellwoodii group, Ctenidodinium spp., Korystocysta gochtii, 215 \nKorystocysta pachyderma, the Meiourogonyaulax caytonensis group, Pareodinia 216 \nceratophora, Sentusidinium spp., Valensiella ovulum and Valensiella spp. (Table 1). 217 \nThis low-diversity assemblage is dominated by forms with epicystal archaeopyles. No 218 \nexclusively Bajocian markers such as Cribroperidinium crispum, Endoscrinium 219 \nasymmetricum of Feist-Burkhardt and Wille (1992) and Meiourogonyaulax valensii 220 \nwere observed (Woollam and Riding, 1983; Feist-Burkhardt and Wille, 1992; Riding 221 \nand Thomas, 1992; Feist-Burkhardt and Monteil, 1997). Furthermore, no taxa with 222 \nBathonian or younger range bases such as Adnatosphaeridium caulleryi, 223 \nMeiourogonyaulax reticulata and Sirmiodinium grossii were recorded (Riding, 1987; 224 \nPrauss, 1989; Feist-Burkhardt and Wille, 1992; Riding and Thomas, 1992). Hence the 225 \nLate Bajocian dinoflagellate cyst assemblage from Mareta Beach cannot provide a 226 \nrefined age assessment; however, it is consistent with the Late Bajocian-Bathonian 227 \ninterval due to the presence of forms such as Ctenidodinium cornigerum and 228 \nKorystocysta pachyderma (see Prauss, 1989, fig. 49; Riding and Thomas, 1992, fig. 229 \n2.10). 230 \n This association, despite the relatively low-diversity, is similar in taxonomic 231 \ncontent to other Late Bajocian marine palynofloras from western Europe (e.g. Prauss, 232 \n1989; Feist-Burkhardt and Monteil, 1997). Unsurprisingly, no characteristic boreal taxa 233 \nsuch as Phallocysta thomasii and Valvaeodinium aquilonium were observed. The latter 234 \ntaxa are presumably coldwater forms which are part of a characteristic assemblage 235 \nrestricted to northern Europe and the Arctic (Smelror, 1991; Smelror and Below, 1992). 236 \n 237 \n4.2.2 Bathonian 238 \n Eighteen samples were studied from the Bathonian strata of Mareta Beach. Nine 239 \nof these (M3, M4, M6, M7, M8, M9, M13, M10 and M21) produced relatively abundant 240 \npalynofloras. The remainder proved either entirely barren or extremely sparse 241 \npalynologically. The lowermost productive samples, M3 and M4 are from a prominent 242 \nmarl bed which overlies the prominent Upper Bajocian calcarenite. This marl was 243 \nassigned to the Early Bathonian by Rocha (1976). The distribution of palynomorphs is 244 \nillustrated in Table 1. Dinoflagellate cysts recorded include Adnatosphaeridium 245 \ncaulleryi, Batiacasphaera spp., Ctenidodinium continuum, Ctenidodinium cornigerum, 246 \n 9 \nthe Ctenidodinium sellwoodii group, Ctenidodinium spp., Ellipsoidictyum\/Valensiella 247 \ngroup, Epiplosphaera gochtii, Gonyaulacysta jurassica subsp. adecta, Korystocysta 248 \ngochtii, Korystocysta pachyderma, Korystocysta spp., the Meiourogonyaulax 249 \ncaytonensis group, Meiourogonyaulax spp., Mendicodinium groenlandicum, Pareodinia 250 \nceratophora, Sentusidinium spp., Systematophora areolata, Tubotuberella dangeardii 251 \nand Valensiella ovulum (Table 1). Forms with epicystal archaeopyles are prominent in 252 \nthis moderately diverse assemblage. This is typical of the Bathonian Stage of Europe 253 \n(Riding et al., 1985; 1991; 1999). More specifically, it is similar in nature to the 254 \nBathonian assemblages reported from the Lusitanian Basin, eastern central Portugal by 255 \nDavies (1985, fig. 8) and Smelror et al. (1991, fig. 7). The presence of forms such as 256 \nAdnatosphaeridium caulleryi, Ctenidodinium cornigerum, the Ctenidodinium sellwoodii 257 \ngroup, Ctenidodinium spp., the Ellipsoidictyum\/Valensiella group, Gonyaulacysta 258 \njurassica subsp. adecta, Korystocysta spp. and Valensiella ovulum is characteristic of 259 \nthe Bathonian Stage (e.g. Gocht, 1970; Sarjeant, 1976; Fenton et al., 1980; 260 \nTaugourdeau-Lantz and Lachkar, 1984; Riding et al., 1985; Prauss, 1989; Riding and 261 \nThomas, 1992). Specifically, the range bases of Adnatosphaeridium caulleryi, 262 \nGonyaulacysta jurassica subsp. adecta, Mendicodinium groenlandicum and 263 \nTubotuberella dangeardii are intra-Early Bathonian (Riding et al., 1985; Prauss, 1989; 264 \nFeist-Burkhardt and Wille, 1992). The range top of Ctenidodinium cornigerum is Late 265 \nBathonian (Riding and Thomas, 1992, fig. 2.10). Thus the Bathonian age of these 266 \nsamples from Mareta Beach is confirmed on dinoflagellate cyst evidence; however the 267 \nbiostratigraphical resolution is not at the substage level. However, no exclusively 268 \nBathonian markers such as Jansonia manifesta and Meiourogonyaulax reticulata were 269 \nrecovered (Riding et al., 1991; Riding and Thomas, 1992). 270 \n The presence of Systematophora areolata is interesting; this is the first report of 271 \nthis species from the Bathonian since that of Bujak and Williams (1977, fig. 2A) from 272 \neasetern Canada. By far the majority of reports of this species, and related forms, record 273 \nits range base as Early to Middle Oxfordian (e.g. Kunz, 1990; Riding and Thomas, 274 \n1997; Riding, 2005). However occasional reports of Systematophora are known from 275 \nthe Callovian (e.g. Huber et al., 1987; Prauss, 1989). 276 \n Ctenidodinium combazii is prominent in the Bathonian of southern England 277 \n(Riding et al., 1985). This distinctive taxon is not widespread, and was not recorded 278 \nfrom Mareta Beach. Riding et al. (1985) contended that the highly-ornamented 279 \n 10 \nCtenidodinium combazii preferred stable, open marine conditions and was not tolerant 280 \nof environmental fluctuations and stresses. In contrast, less ornamented forms such as 281 \nCtenidodinium sellwoodii and Korystocysta spp. were geographically-widespread and 282 \nconsequently were more environmentally tolerant. Ctenidodinium combazii appears to 283 \nhave been restricted to the Bathonian of part of northwest Europe (England, Germany, 284 \nFrance, The Netherlands). It has not been recorded from localities in the Tethyan region 285 \nsuch as Iberia or Israel (Conway, 1978; 1990; Davies, 1983). Hence it is possible that 286 \nthe distribution of Ctenidodinium combazii was at least partially controlled by latitude. 287 \nSmelror et al. (1991, fig. 7) reported this species from the Early Callovian (Herveyi 288 \n[previously Macrocephalus] Chronozone) in the Lusitanian Basin, central Portugal. 289 \n As mentioned above, the Bathonian dinoflagellate cyst assemblage from Mareta 290 \nBeach is similar to coeval floras from northwest Europe. The Bathonian was a time of 291 \nsignificant provincialism in the Northern Hemisphere (Riding et al., 1999). Boreal 292 \nforms such as Evansia perireticulata, Lacrymodinium warrenii, Paragonyaulacysta spp. 293 \nand Valvaeodinium thereseae were unsurprisingly not recorded from the Algarve Basin. 294 \nThe latter taxa are presumed to be cold-loving\/Arctic forms (Bailey and Partington, 295 \n1991; Smelror and Below, 1992). 296 \n 297 \n4.2.3 Callovian 298 \n Twenty-seven samples were studied from the Callovian succession exposed at 299 \nMareta Beach. Thirteen of these proved entirely palynologically barren; the remaining 300 \n14 samples yielded palynofloras of variable productivity. The productive samples are 301 \noverwhelmingly in the Lower and Middle Callovian; by contrast the Upper Callovian 302 \nsuccession proved largely devoid of palynomorphs (Table 1). Samples M25, M27 and 303 \nM28 are from a marl-dominated unit, which is considered to be Early Callovian in age, 304 \nand was assigned to the Herveyi Chronozone by Rocha (1976). The interbedded 305 \nlimestones and marls above the stratigraphical break between 37 and 57 m were 306 \nassigned to the Middle Callovian (Coronatum Chronozone) by Rocha (1976). The 307 \npalynomorph distribution is illustrated in Table 1. The dinoflagellate cysts recorded 308 \ninclude Batiacasphaera spp., Chytroeisphaeridia chytroeides, the Ctenidodinium 309 \nsellwoodii group, Ctenidodinium spp., the Ellipsoidictyum\/Valensiella group, 310 \nEpiplosphaera gochtii, Gonyaulacysta jurassica subsp. adecta, Gonyaulacysta sp., 311 \n 11 \nImpletosphaeridium spp., Korystocysta gochtii, Korystocysta spp., the 312 \nMeiourogonyaulax caytonensis group, Meiourogonyaulax spp., Mendicodinium 313 \ngroenlandicum, Pareodinia ceratophora, Sentusidinium spp., Systematophora areolata, 314 \nSystematophora penicillata, Systematophora spp., Tubotuberella dangeardii, 315 \nTubotuberella spp., Valensiella ovulum and Valensiella spp. (Table 1). Of this 316 \nassociation, the Ctenidodinium sellwoodii group is the most prominent. 317 \n This assemblage is of moderate diversity and is typical of the Callovian of 318 \nEurope. The consistent presence of forms such as Ctenidodinium continuum, the 319 \nCtenidodinium sellwoodii group, Gonyaulacysta jurassica subsp. adecta, Korystocysta 320 \ngochtii, the Meiourogonyaulax caytonensis group, Meiourogonyaulax spp., 321 \nMendicodinium groenlandicum and Tubotuberella dangeardii is characteristic of the 322 \nCallovian Stage (e.g. Prauss, 1989; Riding and Thomas, 1997; Riding, 2005). Smelror 323 \net al. (1991, fig. 7) reported a similar flora with prominent Ctenidodinium sellwoodii 324 \nfrom Cape Mondego in the Lusitanian Basin of central Portugal. 325 \n The Early Callovian (Herveyi Chronozone) samples M25, M26, M27 and M28 326 \nlack Early Callovian dinoflagellate cyst markers known from further north in Europe 327 \nsuch as Chytroeisphaeridia hyalina, Ctenidodinium combazii and Impletosphaeridium 328 \nvarispinosum. Species of Systematophora are present; further north the inception of this 329 \ngenus is normally within the Oxfordian (see above). Likewise, ?Leptodinium sp. is 330 \npresent in sample M25; this genus is normally present in Oxfordian and younger strata 331 \n(e.g. Riding and Thomas, 1992). Liesbergia liesbergensis was recovered from sample 332 \nM27 (Table 1). This species is present from the Middle Callovian-Early Oxfordian 333 \ninterval (Berger, 1986; Riding and Thomas, 1997). 334 \n The occurrence of Ctenidodinium ornatum in the Middle Callovian sample M47 335 \nis potentially significant. This species is typical of the Middle-Upper Callovian of 336 \nnorthwest Europe (Berger, 1986). Endoscrinium asymmetricum was recorded from 337 \nsample M47 and questionably in M45 (Table 1). This species is typical of the Early-338 \nMiddle Callovian interval (Riding, 1987; 2005; Riding and Thomas, 1997). The chorate 339 \ntaxon Impletosphaeridium varispinosum is confined to sample M48 (Table 1). This is 340 \nthe first report of this taxon from southern Europe. Elsewhere in northwest Europe, this 341 \nspecies is confined to the Early Callovian (Riley and Fenton, 1982; Riding and Thomas, 342 \n1997; Riding, 2005). Sample M47 yielded small proportions of Rhynchodiniopsis? 343 \n 12 \nregalis (Table 1). This distinctive form is typical of the Bajocian-Bathonian further 344 \nnorth in Europe (e.g. Riding et al., 1985; Feist-Burkhardt and Wille, 1992). The only 345 \noccurrence of the genus Wanaea in this study is the record of Wanaea acollaris in 346 \nsample M45 (Table 1). This is entirely consistent with a Callovian age (Riding and 347 \nThomas, 1992). The only productive sample in the Upper Callovian, M32, produced a 348 \nrelatively low diversity flora similar to those from the underlying Middle Callovian 349 \n(Table 1). 350 \n Callovian dinoflagellate cyst floras from further north in Europe are normally 351 \nmarkedly higher in diversity than those recorded herein. The majority of Callovian 352 \nbiomarkers known in northwest Europe are apparently absent in the Algarve Basin. No 353 \nunequivocal intra-Callovian markers were recovered from Mareta Beach. These include 354 \nthe many forms which typically have range bases in the Late Callovian such as 355 \nScriniodinium crystallinum, Trichodinium scarburghensis and Wanaea thysanota (see 356 \nRiley and Fenton, 1982; Feist-Burkhardt and Wille, 1992; Riding and Thomas, 1992). 357 \nDespite the lack of these biomarkers, the occurrences of Ctenidodinium ornatum 358 \n(sample M47), Endoscrinium asymmetricum (M47), Impletosphaeridium varispinosum 359 \n(M48) and Wanaea acollaris (M45) is broadly consistent with a Middle Callovian 360 \n(Coronatum Chronozone) age. 361 \n The relatively low diversity nature of this dinoflagellate cyst flora was probably 362 \ninfluenced by several factors. The Mareta Beach succession represented relatively deep 363 \nwater conditions, seaward of reef limestone facies within a highly enclosed basin. 364 \nRocha (1976) envisaged an offshore pelagic setting, possibly with stratified water and 365 \noccasional upwelling within a restricted marine environment. The latter interpretation is 366 \nnot consistent with the palynofacies, which is not typical of highly organic-rich facies 367 \nand the occurrence of benthic faunas (largely echinoderms, foraminifera, gastropods, 368 \nostracods and the ichnogenus Zoophycos). The relatively restricted nature of the marine 369 \nwaters at this locality probably prevented communication with many dinoflagellate 370 \ncysts typical of further north in Europe which explains the low-diversity floras. Boreal 371 \ntaxa such as Evansia dalei, Evansia perireticulata, Paragonyaulacysta calloviensis and 372 \nParagonyaulacysta retiphragmata were not recorded from Mareta Beach. The latter 373 \ntaxa are cold-loving\/Arctic forms (Smelror and Below, 1992; Riding et al., 1999). 374 \n 375 \n 13 \n4.3. Cilheta Beach 376 \n Cilheta lies 1 km west of Sagres, and the cliffs expose a sparsely fossiliferous, 377 \ncarbonate-dominated succession 41 m thick which has been assigned to the Late 378 \nCallovian to the ?Late Oxfordian-Kimmeridgian interval by Rocha (1976) (Fig. 5). At 379 \nsea level to 22 m, a unit of marly limestone with two thin (<1.0 m) marly interbeds is 380 \nexposed. These beds were deemed to be of Late Callovian (Athleta Zone) age by Rocha 381 \n(1976). Eleven samples were taken from this Upper Callovian unit (Fig. 5). The Upper 382 \nCallovian is unconformably overlain by a thin (ca. 0.5 m) fossiliferous limestone of 383 \nMiddle Oxfordian (Plicatilis Chronozone) age (Fig. 5). This unconformity is markedly 384 \nangular and extremely prominent (Choffat, 1887; Rocha, 1976, fig. 2.12). It represents a 385 \nregional hiatus which can be traced throughout Iberia (Mouterde, 1971). The youngest 386 \nunit at Cilheta Beach comprises approximately 20 m of dolomitised limestones of Late 387 \nOxfordian-Kimmeridgian age (Fig. 5). 388 \n The two marl beds in the Upper Callovian succession at Cilheta produced 389 \nrelatively abundant organic residues which are dominated by dinoflagellate cysts with 390 \nsubordinate pollen and spores. By contrast, the marly limestones largely proved 391 \npalynologically barren (Fig. 5, Table 2). This section proved significantly more 392 \nproductive than the Upper Callovian samples studied from Mareta Beach (see above). 393 \nThe dinoflagellate cyst assemblages are moderately well-preserved, and are 394 \noverwhelmingly dominated by Ctenidodinium cornigerum, the Ctenidodinium 395 \nsellwoodii group, and intermediate morphotypes between these two forms. Other taxa 396 \nwhich are consistently present include Gonyaulacysta jurassica subsp. adecta, 397 \nindeterminate chorate cysts, Korystocysta gochtii, Meiourogonyaulax spp., Pareodinia 398 \nceratophora, Sentusidinium spp., Surculosphaeridium? vestitum, Systematophora 399 \nareolata and Tubotuberella dangeardii (Table 2). The pollen-spore associations are 400 \nrelatively sparse, and are of low diversity. These include bisaccate pollen, 401 \nCallialasporites dampieri, Callialasporites spp., Classopollis classoides, Cyathidites 402 \nspp. and Ischyosporites variegatus (Table 2). 403 \n Late Callovian dinoflagellate cyst assemblages from further north in Europe are 404 \nsignificantly higher in diversity, and typically not dominated by Ctenidodinium (e.g. 405 \nWoollam, 1980; Prauss, 1989; Riding and Thomas, 1997). Representatives of the many 406 \ntaxa with Late Callovian range bases in northwest Europe such as Trichodinium 407 \n 14 \nscarburghensis are absent (see above). Furthermore, the acme of Mendicodinium 408 \ngroenlandicum so typical of the Late Callovian of northwest Europe (Woollam, 1980; 409 \nRiding and Thomas, 1997) is not present in the Algarve Basin. Nevertheless, the 410 \ndinoflagellate cyst associations from Cilheta Beach are indicative of a Callovian age. 411 \nGonyaulacysta jurassica subsp. adecta, Korystocysta spp., Meiourogonyaulax 412 \ncaytonensis and Tubotuberella dangeardii are highly characteristic of the Callovian 413 \nStage (Riding and Thomas, 1992; Riding, 2005). As at Mareta Beach, the majority of 414 \nthe well established northwest European Callovian biomarkers were not recorded at 415 \nCilheta Beach. However, the range tops of Ctenidodinium continuum and Pareodinia 416 \nprolongata are present (Table 2); these bioevents are known to be Late Callovian (Riley 417 \nand Fenton, 1982; Herngreen et al., 1984; Berger, 1986; Kunz, 1990). The inception of 418 \nSurculosphaeridium? vestitum, which is present at Cilheta (Table 2), is intra-Callovian 419 \n(Riding, 1987; Prauss, 1989; Feist-Burkhardt and Wille, 1992). Typically, the range 420 \nbase of Surculosphaeridium? vestitum is of Middle-Late Callovian age (Coronatum and 421 \nAthleta chronozones) (Woollam, 1980; Riding, 2005). Hence, this occurrence supports 422 \nthe Late Callovian age of the unit sampled at Cilheta. As mentioned previously, the 423 \nchorate genus Systematophora, which was recorded throughout at Cilheta (Table 2), is 424 \nnormally typical of the Late Jurassic. 425 \n The low diversity nature of the Late Callovian dinoflagellate cyst associations 426 \nfrom Cilheta Beach is probably largely due to palaeogeographical factors. This 427 \nsuccession was deposited in a partially enclosed, relatively deep water basin seaward of 428 \nreef limestone facies. The palaeoenvironment was interpreted as restricted offshore 429 \npelagic, possibly with stratified waters and sporadic upwelling by Rocha (1976). 430 \nHowever, the palynofacies and benthic faunas are not typical of an organic-rich 431 \ndepositional setting. The restricted nature of the Algarve Basin during the Callovian 432 \nprobably prevented full mixing of dinoflagellates with areas further to the north in 433 \nEurope. This at least partially explains the low-diversity assemblages. Typically boreal 434 \ngenera which have latitudinally-controlled northerly distributions such as Crussolia and 435 \nParagonyaulacysta are not present in the Cilheta Beach section. 436 \n 437 \n4.4. The Carrapateira outlier 438 \n 15 \n The Carrapateira outlier is located north of the main Algarve Basin, west of 439 \nCarrapateira village and consists of basic volcanics, dolomites, limestones, marls and 440 \nsandstones of Late Triassic to Late Jurassic age. The most complete exposures in the 441 \nCarrapateira outlier, are the spectacular coastal outcrops of Upper Jurassic carbonates 442 \nwhich have been partially dolomitised (Ramalho and Ribeiro, 1985). An Early 443 \nKimmeridgian age for this section has been invoked based on corals (Choffat, 1887; 444 \nGeyer, 1956; Rosendhal, 1985) and foraminifera (Ramalho and Ribeiro, 1985; Ribeiro 445 \net al., 1987). 446 \n The lowermost part of the succession at Carrapateira consists of approximately 447 \n150 m of intensely dolomitised limestones. By contrast, the uppermost strata comprise 448 \n50 m of interbedded limestones and marls (Fig. 6). Because dolomites are typically 449 \ndevoid of palynomorphs, only the undolomitised uppermost beds were sampled herein. 450 \nThirty-eight samples largely from the marls were studied; seven of these (C1-C7) are 451 \nfrom a prominent marl bed between 18 and 36 m above the base of the section (Fig. 6). 452 \n The organic residues from Carrapateira are abundant in wood fragments and 453 \nvarious plant phytoclasts. Moderately well-preserved palynomorphs are also present, 454 \npollen and spores being more abundant than marine microplankton. The palynomorphs, 455 \nespecially the dinoflagellate cysts, have been affected by pyrite. The most persistent 456 \ndinoflagellate cysts are Batiacasphaera spp., the Cribroperidinium globatum group, 457 \nCtenidodinium spp., the Ellipsoidictyum\/Valensiella group, Gonyaulacysta jurassica 458 \nsubsp. jurassica, indeterminate chorate cysts, Mendicodinium groenlandicum, 459 \nSentusidinium spp., Systematophora areolata, Systematophora spp. and Tubotuberella 460 \ndangeardii. Other taxa include Amphorula sp., Corculodinium inaffectum, Histiophora 461 \nornata, Hystrichosphaerina? orbifera, Korystocysta gochtii, Occisucysta balios, 462 \nPareodinia ceratophora, Rhynchodiniopsis spp., Scriniodinium inritibile, 463 \nSystematophora penicillata and Valensiella ovulum (Table 3). The pollen-spore 464 \nassociations are of low diversity and include bisaccate pollen, Callialasporites spp., 465 \nClassopollis classoides, Cyathidites spp., Ischyosporites variegatus, Leptolepidites spp. 466 \nand Perinopollenites elatoides (Table 3). 467 \n The dinoflagellate cyst associations from Carrapateira are indicative of an Early 468 \nKimmeridgian age by comparison to other records from northwest Europe. The 469 \noccurrences of Corculodinium inaffectum (sample C29), Gochteodinia sp. (sample C35) 470 \n 16 \nand Occisucysta balios (sample C29) are all indicative of the Kimmeridgian Stage 471 \n(N\u00f8hr-Hansen, 1986; Riding, 1987; Riding and Thomas, 1988; Barron, 1989; Riding et 472 \nal., 1999). Furthermore, species such as Cribroperidinium globatum, 473 \nHystrichosphaerina? orbifera, Scriniodinium inritibile and Systematophora penicillata 474 \nare highly characteristic of the Kimmeridgian (Riding and Thomas, 1988). More 475 \nspecifically, the occurrences of Gonyaulacysta jurassica subsp. jurassica and 476 \nTubotuberella dangeardii throughout the productive part of the succession mean that 477 \nthis section is no younger than Early Kimmeridgian. The range tops of these forms are 478 \nEarly Kimmeridgian (Lam and Porter, 1977; Riding, 1987; Riding and Thomas, 1988; 479 \nBarron, 1989; Jan du Ch\u00eane et al., 1999). Tubotuberella dangeardii is especially typical 480 \nof the earliest Kimmeridgian (Baylei and Cymodoce chronozones) (Riding and Thomas, 481 \n1988). The occurrences of Amphorula sp. (sample C35), Histiophora spp. (samples 482 \nC49, C50) and Histiophora ornata (sample C35) are also highly significant. Amphorula 483 \nand Histiophora are both typical of the Kimmeridgian and Tithonian of the Tethyan 484 \nRealm. Amphorula ranges from the latest Oxfordian to the Berriasian (Monteil, 1990, 485 \ntables 4, 5). Amphorula dodekovae has been recorded from the Late Oxfordian to 486 \nMiddle Tithonian of the North Atlantic and Europe (Zotto et al., 1987; Brenner, 1988; 487 \nDodekova, 1992; Feist-Burkhardt and Wille, 1992); this taxon is especially 488 \ncharacteristic of the Kimmeridgian Stage. D\u00fcrr (1987; 1988) reported prominent 489 \nHistiophora ornata from the Early Kimmeridgian Mutabilis Chronozone of southern 490 \nGermany. Dodekova (1992, p. 42) stated that this species ranges from the Middle 491 \nKimmeridgian to Early Tithonian of Bulgaria. Hence the presence of Histiophora 492 \nornata in sample C35 is indicative of the Early Kimmeridgian by comparison with the 493 \nGerman records. The Early Kimmeridgian age of the succession at Carrapateira based 494 \non corals and foraminifera is therefore confirmed by dinoflagellate cysts, specifically 495 \nthe co-occurrences of Histiophora ornata, Gonyaulacysta jurassica subsp. jurassica and 496 \nTubotuberella dangeardii. It is possible that some reworking from the 497 \nCallovian\/Oxfordian may be present due to the occurrences of Korystocysta spp. 498 \n(Riding, 2005) (Table 3). 499 \n Mohr and Schmidt (1988) reported a poorly-preserved, low diversity Late 500 \nOxfordian-Early Kimmeridgian dinoflagellate cyst flora from the Lusitanian Basin, 501 \ncentral Portugal. This is dominated by proximate\/proximochorate forms with apical 502 \narchaeopyles, i.e. Cassiculosphaeridia, Escharisphaeridia and Sentusidinium. 503 \n 17 \n Kimmeridgian dinoflagellate cyst assemblages from further north in Europe 504 \nnormally have markedly higher diversities (e.g. Ioannides et al., 1976; D\u00fcrr, 1988; 505 \nRiding and Thomas, 1988) than these southern Portuguese floras. Closer to Portugal, 506 \nvan Erve et al. (1988) reported more diverse palynofloras from the Lower 507 \nKimmeridgian of eastern Spain. Some typically Early Kimmeridgian species such as 508 \nEndoscrinium luridum and Glossodinium dimorphum were not observed at Carrapateira. 509 \nThe relatively low diversity nature of the Early Kimmeridgian dinoflagellate cyst floras 510 \nfrom Carrapateira was probably largely controlled by palaeogeographical factors. The 511 \nbeds in the middle part of the succession were probably deposited in a relatively deep 512 \nwater, partially enclosed depocentre, whereas the lower and upper part of this section 513 \nwere deposited in shallow water settings represented by lagoon and reef carbonate 514 \nfacies. The partially enclosed nature of this part of the Algarve Basin during the Early 515 \nKimmeridgian appears to have prevented free mixing of the dinoflagellates with areas 516 \noutwith southern Portugal. Typically boreal taxa which have latitudinally-controlled 517 \nnortherly distributions such as Gonyaulacysta dualis and Paragonyaulacysta capillosa 518 \n(see Davies, 1983) are not present in the Carrapateira section. 519 \n 520 \n5. Overview of the Jurassic palynofloras of the Algarve Basin and the Carrapateira 521 \noutlier 522 \n Palynomorph assemblages from the Lower, Middle and Upper Jurassic (Upper 523 \nPliensbachian-Lower Kimmeridgian) succession from the Algarve Basin and the 524 \nCarrapateira outlier, southern Portugal were studied. The Upper Pliensbachian to Lower 525 \nToarcian strata of Arma\u00e7\u00e3o Nova Bay proved extremely sparse palynologically, no 526 \ndinoflagellate cysts were encountered. Dinoflagellate cysts were confined to the Upper 527 \nBajocian to Upper Callovian sedimentary rocks exposed at Mareta and Cilheta beaches 528 \nand the Lower Kimmeridgian strata of the Carrapateira outlier. 529 \n At Mareta Beach, the Upper Bajocian and Bathonian produced low\/moderate 530 \ndiversity assemblages dominated by Ctenidodinium and Korystocysta. In the Upper 531 \nBajocian, no stratigraphical markers were recorded. By contrast, in the Bathonian, 532 \nseveral key bioevents confirm the age of the succession. The chorate species 533 \nSystematophora areolata was, unusually, recorded from the Bathonian. The absence of 534 \nCtenidodinium combazii may have been due to palaeoecological factors and\/or 535 \n 18 \nlatitudinal control. The productive Callovian samples from this locality are largely from 536 \nthe Lower and Middle Callovian succession. The Ctenidodinium sellwoodii group 537 \nproved prominent. Ctenidodinium ornatum, Endoscrinium asymmetricum, 538 \nImpletosphaeridium varispinosum, Liesbergia liesbergensis and Wanaea acollaris are 539 \npresent and these species confirm the Callovian age of these strata. 540 \n Two marl units in the Upper Callovian of Cilheta yielded relatively abundant 541 \ndinoflagellate cysts which are dominated by Ctenidodinium cornigerum and the 542 \nCtenidodinium sellwoodii group. The diversity is markedly lower than typical Late 543 \nCallovian associations from further north in Europe. The occurrences of taxa such as 544 \nGonyaulacysta jurassica subsp. adecta and Meiourogonyaulax caytonensis, together 545 \nwith some key Late Callovian bioevents, are characteristic of the Callovian Stage. To 546 \nsummarise, the Upper Bajocian to Callovian strata at the Mareta and Cilheta beaches 547 \nproduced low diversity dinoflagellate cyst assemblages; many familiar marker forms 548 \nfrom northwest Europe were not encountered. Furthermore, no typically Tethyan forms, 549 \nor any latitudinally-controlled northerly (Arctic) forms were recovered throughout this 550 \nsuccession. 551 \n The Carrapateira outlier includes spectacular outcrops of partially dolomitised 552 \nUpper Jurassic (Early Kimmeridgian) carbonates which have yielded dinoflagellate cyst 553 \nfloras. These are indicative of an Early Kimmeridgian age due to the occurrences of key 554 \ntaxa such as Amphorula sp., Corculodinium inaffectum, Gonyaulacysta jurassica subsp. 555 \njurassica, Histiophora ornata, Hystrichosphaerina? orbifera, Occisucysta balios and 556 \nTubotuberella dangeardii. This confirms the dating of Early Kimmeridgian based on 557 \ncorals and foraminifera. Amphorula and Histiophora are both typical of the Upper 558 \nJurassic of the Tethyan Realm; no Arctic\/boreal forms were observed. 559 \n 560 \n6. Conclusions 561 \n The dinoflagellate cyst assemblages from the Upper Bajocian, Bathonian and 562 \nCallovian of Mareta and Cilheta beaches and the Lower Kimmeridgian of the 563 \nCarrapateira outlier proved to be consistently significantly less diverse than coeval 564 \nassemblages from northwest Europe. Many important, well-established marker forms 565 \nwere not encountered from southern Portugal. The relatively low diversity nature of 566 \n 19 \nthese dinoflagellate cyst floras was probably largely due to palaeogeographical factors. 567 \nThe Upper Bajocian to Callovian successions at Mareta and Cilheta beaches, and the 568 \nmiddle part of the Lower Kimmeridgian section of the Carrapateira outlier were 569 \ndeposited in relatively deep water, partially enclosed depositional settings. 570 \n During the Bajocian to Callovian, this part of the Algarve Basin was located 571 \nseaward of reef limestone facies within this enclosed basin. The depocentre is thus 572 \ninterpreted as a restricted offshore pelagic setting. Rocha (1976) suggested that there 573 \nwere intervals within the Bajocian to Callovian when the waters became stratified with 574 \nsporadic upwelling of bottom waters. The benthic faunas and the palynofacies do not, 575 \nhowever, support the occurrence of organic-rich sediments. Hence the partially enclosed 576 \nnature of this part of the Algarve Basin and the Carrapateira outlier during the Late 577 \nBajocian to the Early Kimmeridgian appears to have prevented the free migration of 578 \ndinoflagellates (and other planktonic groups) between southern Portugal and elsewhere 579 \nin Europe and surrounding areas. This, at least partially, explains the low diversity 580 \nassemblages of marine microplankton. No typically northerly (Arctic) or Tethyan taxa 581 \nwere recovered throughout this succession. Callovian dinoflagellate cyst assemblages 582 \nwere relatively uniform throughout the Northern Hemisphere (Riding et al., 1999), 583 \nhence the principal reason for the relatively restricted floras in this part of the Algarve 584 \nBasin appears to have been the enclosed nature of the depocentre at this time. 585 \n Despite the relatively low diversity palynofloras recovered, this study has helped 586 \nto establish that Late Bajocian to Late Callovian dinoflagellate cyst associations do not 587 \nexhibit significant biotal provincialism between southern and northern Europe. Coeval 588 \nfloras from North Africa and the Middle East, to the south and east respectively of 589 \nPortugal also appear to lie within this relatively extensive Northern Hemisphere floral 590 \nprovince (e.g. Conway, 1978; 1990; Thusu and Vigran, 1985; Thusu et al., 1988; 591 \nWheeler and Sarjeant, 1990; El Beialy and Ibrahim, 1997; El Beialy et al., 2002; 592 \nIbrahim et al., 2002; 2003). By contrast, there is a clear distinction between European 593 \nand Arctic assemblages, with significant numbers of typically high latitude Middle 594 \nJurassic taxa being confined to the boreal realm (Smelror and Below, 1992; Riding et 595 \nal., 1999). 596 \n The Lower Kimmeridgian of the Carrapateira outlier also produced relatively 597 \nlow diversity dinoflagellate cyst assemblages. Unsurprisingly no boreal forms were 598 \n 20 \nobserved; however some Tethyan elements such as Amphorula sp. and Histiophora 599 \nornata are present. The occurrence of typically Tethyan forms is consistent with 600 \nsignificant provincialism between northern and southern Europe at this time (Riding and 601 \nIoannides, 1996; Abbink et al., 2001). 602 \n 603 \nAcknowlegements 604 \n The input of Marisa E.N.
