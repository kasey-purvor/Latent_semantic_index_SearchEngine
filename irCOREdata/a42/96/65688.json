In recent years, however, the movement in the U.K. \n(which forms the focus for this paper) has seen a much more dramatic rate of development as a \nresult of the \u201cmainstreaming\u201d of Fair Trade food products through conventional retail outlets, \nparticularly the supermarket \u201cmultiples\u201d. With this development has come a significant change both \nin product quality and in marketing, with several Fair Trade brands, (Caf\u00e9direct coffee and tea, \nDivine chocolate, Clipper coffee and tea, and Percol coffee, to name the most obvious), now taking \ntheir place alongside more established brands on the supermarket shelves. \n \nWith this process of mainstreaming have come related concerns that Fair Trade may have \u2018sold out\u2019 \nto the multiples, that its message may have become diluted, that it may even have \u2018lost its soul\u2019. At \nsuch a critical time in its development, some reflection on what Fair Trade has become and what its \nfuture options may be, is clearly important. To aid in such reflection the macromarketing literature \nprovides a helpful framework, while at the same time Fair Trade provides the macromarketing \nliterature with an exceptional case study of the way in which its conceptualisations may be turned \ninto \u201cprograms of action\u201d (Dolan, 2002, p.175). \n \nThis paper, then, proceeds as follows. It begins with a short review of the Fair Trade movement, \ndiscussing its development and also its underpinning definition and purpose. It then explores the \nmainstreaming of Fair Trade food products to provide a basis from which the current position can \nbe critically reviewed. A discussion of the macromarketing literature provides a backdrop against \nwhich the findings of an empirical study are described. The empirical study involved interviews \nwith and case study material from key Fair Trade organisations and those supermarkets which have \nengaged seriously with Fair Trade. The paper concludes with some reflections both on the import of \nthe macromarketing literature for the future of the Fair Trade movement and on potential \ndevelopments for macromarketing as a result of this exposure to the Fair Trade movement. \n \nThe Fair Trade movement: history, definition and recent developments \n \nThere have been various assessments of the Fair Trade movement (Adams, 1989; Barratt-Brown, \n1993), but a more recent discussion of the development, parameters and issues facing Fair Trade is \ncontained in Moore (2004). Starting from isolated examples of northern organisations beginning to \ntrade with southern producers, Fair Trade developed into a small but international \u201cmovement\u201d in \nthe 1960s and 1970s. Its origins were in craft goods imported directly from these southern \nproducers and sold through \u201calternative\u201d1 channels to a limited market of concerned northern \nconsumers. However, food products were developed in the 1980s starting with coffee, which was \nmarketed originally as \u201cCampaign\u201d coffee in the U.K. \u2013 a clear signal of the radical side of the \nmovement. As the movement gathered momentum a number of umbrella bodies were formed. IFAT  \n(originally the International Federation for Alternative Trade but known now as the International \nFair Trade Association) was established in 1989 as a worldwide membership organisation bringing \n                                            \n1 \u201cAlternative\u201d is frequently used instead of \u201cFair\u201d. The origins of this are in the use of the term \u201cAlternative Trading \nOrganisations\u201d (ATOs) a name stemming from the early days of Fair Trade where \u201cfair\u201d seemed too weak a description \nof the common and radical vision that forged these organisations into a movement. \n \n 3\nAccepted for publication in Journal of Strategic Marketing.  \nPlease do not cite without authors\u2019 permission. \n \ntogether both producers and buyers. While still growing, it currently consists of over 270 Fair Trade \norganisations in 60 countries with approximately 65% of members based in the South (IFAT, \n2005). In the U.K. the Fairtrade Foundation was formed in 1994 and then became a member of the \nFairtrade Labelling Organisations International (FLO) when it was established in 1997. These two \norganisations have been particularly significant in the growth of Fair Trade food products with FLO \nproviding the worldwide standard setting and certification process that allows the Fairtrade Mark (a \nlabelling device that guarantees that FLO standards have been met \u2013 see further below) to be \napplied to particular products2, while the Fairtrade Foundation, in common with other similar \nnational organisations, provides the \u2018local\u2019 marketing arm \u2013 see Moore (2004, pp.75-76) for further \ndetails. \n \nThe accepted definition of Fair Trade, drawn together by various members of the movement, is as \nfollows: \n \nFair Trade is a trading partnership, based on dialogue, transparency and respect, that seeks \ngreater equity in international trade. It contributes to sustainable development by offering \nbetter trading conditions to, and securing the rights of, marginalized producers and workers \n\u2013 especially in the South. Fair trade organisations (backed by consumers) are engaged \nactively in supporting producers, awareness raising and in campaigning for changes in the \nrules and practice of conventional international trade.  (FINE, 20013) \n \nThis definition has, in essence, two basic components. The first is to provide a working model of \ninternational trade that makes a difference to the producers and consumers that engage in it and to \ndo so in such a way that social objectives \u2013 better trading conditions, the securing of rights and the \ndevelopment of consumer consciousness in the North \u2013 are met. The second and more radical \ncomponent of Fair Trade is to challenge orthodoxy in business practice: to be a  \u201ctool for modifying \nthe dominant economic model\u201d (Renard, 2003, p.91) and encourage it towards more social ends. \n \nAs indicated above, of particular interest at present is the mainstreaming of Fair Trade. As food \nproducts have become an increasingly important part of the Fair Trade offering, presently \nrepresenting around two-thirds of worldwide Fair Trade retail sales (see Moore, 2004, pp.74-75), \nthere has been a concerted move into mainstream retailing, with supermarkets representing the \nprimary channel through which such goods are now sold. With this move has come the challenge to \nthe Fair Trade movement of how to maintain the purity of the Fair Trade concept, while gaining the \nbenefits of the increased volumes that access to the mainstream provides to southern producers. \nVarious commentators have described this process as the \u201csubversion\u201d, \u201cdilution\u201d, \u201credefinition\u201d or \n\u201creabsorption\u201d of the concept (see Moore, 2004, p.83 and further below). However, an alternative \nperspective is that Fair Trade can not only more fully achieve its mission of supporting \nmarginalized producers and workers by enabling their access to such channels and to the volumes \nassociated with them, but that this is also the best way of achieving the second part of the mission. \nBy working closely with these conventional players in international trade, Fair Trade organisations \n                                            \n2 FLO currently sets standards for the following products:  cocoa, coffee, flowers, fresh fruit, honey, juices, rice, sugar, \ntea, wine and sports balls, with standards for more tropical fruit and other tropical products under development. See \nwww.fairtrade.net. \n3 FINE is an informal network that involves the Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International (FLO), the International \nFederation for Alternative Trade (IFAT), the Network of European Shops (NEWS!) and the European Fair Trade \nAssociation (EFTA). \n 4\nAccepted for publication in Journal of Strategic Marketing.  \nPlease do not cite without authors\u2019 permission. \n \nhave the opportunity to challenge the \u201cdominant economic model\u201d in a way, and with a degree of \ncredibility, that would otherwise be unavailable. \n \nThe significant developments in volume caused by such mainstreaming, and hence the opportunity \nboth for dilution and for influence, are certainly borne out by an inspection of the figures for the \ngrowth of Fair Trade. Figure 1 shows the worldwide growth in Fair Trade food and drinks by \nvolume based on FLO data. The figure for 2003 is an estimate, but the trend is clear4. \n \nWorld FairTrade Food and Drinks Sales, by volume\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003\nYear\nVo\nlu\nm\ne \n('0\n00\n to\nnn\nes\n)\n \nFigure 1 \nSource: Leatherhead Food International, 2003 \n \nIn terms of the main products Figure 2 shows that bananas are the highest volume product, \naccounting for 62% of total volume in 2002, followed by coffee as the other significant volume \nproduct with 27% in 2002.

The Market Intelligence Section of Leatherhead Food International has produced the most recent international \nreport, which also makes some projections, but even this analyses only Fair Trade food products. \n5 A rough estimate gives a ratio of 27, suggesting that the value of coffee sales is around 12 times that of bananas. \n 5\nAccepted for publication in Journal of Strategic Marketing.  \nPlease do not cite without authors\u2019 permission. \n \nSource: Leatherhead Food International, 2003 \n \nThe position in the U.K. is broadly similar, with sales of Fair Trade goods which carry the Fairtrade \nMark having an estimated retail value of \u00a3140million in 2004, up from \u00a392.3million the previous \nyear. At the individual product level Fair Trade products have 18% of the U.K. roast and ground \ncoffee market, 3% of overall coffee sales and 5% of the total U.K. banana market. Sales increases, \nby retail value, in the five years from 2000-2004 were: coffee 218%, tea 153%, chocolate\/cocoa \n358% and bananas 292% (Fairtrade Foundation, 2005a). \n \nIn terms of future projections, Leatherhead Food International acknowledged that \u201cthe Fair Trade \nmarket is still at a very early stage of its life cycle, so it is difficult to assess its future prospects\u201d, \nbut based on the confidence in the suppliers of Fair Trade products, the growth rate in organics as a \ncomparator and the general interest in \u201cother ethical issues\u201d, it estimated that the market would \n\u201cshow a 20-25% [per annum] volume and value growth over the next 4-5 years to hit a level of \n150,000 tonnes, worth almost USD1billion by 2007\u201d (Leatherhead Food International, 2003, p.17). \n \nThese figures, of course, do not capture the whole of the Fair Trade market since, as indicated \nabove, there are also non-food products that make up around one-third of the market size (see \nMoore, 2004, pp.74-75 for a discussion of these and the various estimates of market share of non-\nfood products). But it is clear that the main driver of growth of Fair Trade goods has been the food \nproducts and, in terms of the mainstreaming of Fair Trade through commercial channels, it is food \nproducts that have led the way. That FLO has recently introduced a standard for flowers, which \nTesco and Sainsbury\u2019s retail, is an interesting non-food development that will be commented upon \nfurther below. \n \nAs far as the Fair Trade organisations are concerned, the proportion of their turnover derived from \nmainstream sales and hence their susceptibility to commercial and reputational risk depends, of \ncourse, on the extent of their food versus non-food sales and the range of channels through which \nthey sell. Two examples illustrate this. Caf\u00e9direct derives a significant proportion of its turnover \nfrom selling to most major retailers, and although it also sells to the \u201cout-of-home\u201d market only \napproximately 7% of its turnover comes from this source (Caf\u00e9direct, 2003). Traidcraft, by \ncomparison, with a much wider product range and a greater range of distribution channels, derived \nonly 14% of its turnover from supermarkets in 2003\/046, although this is expected to increase in \nfuture. Hence, the direct risks and opportunities inherent in the mainstreaming of Fair Trade vary \nconsiderably across different Fair Trade organisations. However, the focus of this paper is not on \nthe potential impact of mainstreaming on individual organisations, but on the impact of \nmainstreaming on the Fair Trade movement, and the Fair Trade concept, as a whole. \n \nThe macromarketing literature and links with Fair Trade \n \nThere are three immediate links between the FINE definition of Fair Trade given above and the \nmacromarketing literature. The first is the association made in the macromarketing literature \nbetween the \u201cconsumption of material superfluities by the wealthy industrial nations\u201d which is \nclaimed to be \u201cat the expense of consumption of necessities in the Third World\u201d (Kilbourne et al. \n1997, p.12). While Fair Trade does not make the same causal association, there is of course a \nsimilar concern for the economic development of developing countries. The second link is the \n                                            \n6 Traidcraft internal papers. \n 6\nAccepted for publication in Journal of Strategic Marketing.  \nPlease do not cite without authors\u2019 permission. \n \ncontention that Fair Trade contributes to sustainable development which resonates with the \nmacromarketing literature\u2019s focus on sustainable consumption \u2013 this is discussed further below. The \nthird link is in relation to notions of equity in international trade and the need to raise awareness of \ninequities and to campaign to change the rules and practice of conventional international trade. But \nwhile there are these points of contact, Fair Trade and the macromarketing literature also provide \nhelpful counterpoints to each other. \n \nMacromarketing and sustainable consumption \nWithin the macromarketing literature is a related set of concepts that raise questions about the \ndirection of current trends in consumerism. At the heart of this set of concepts is that of sustainable \nconsumption: \n \n \u201cSustainable production and consumption is the use of goods and services that respond to \nbasic needs and bring a better quality of life, while minimizing the use of natural resources, \ntoxic materials and emissions of waste and pollutants over the life cycle, so as not to \njeopardize the needs of future generations.\u201d (Oslo Symposium on Sustainable Consumption, \ncited in Dolan, 2002, p.172) \n \nBy contrast with the notion of sustainable consumption are the alternative notions of \u201cconspicuous \nconsumption\u201d (McDonagh, 1998, p.600) and \u201chyper-consumption\u201d, the latter of which occurs \nwhere \n \n \u201cthere is no logical connection between the thing consumed and the consumption act itself \u2013 \nit is consumption for its own sake \u2026 [there is a] total separation of the object of \nconsumption from nature: the image is being consumed, rather than the object.\u2026 Within \nhyper-consumption \u2026 the sign value, or image, eclipses the commodity referent and \nsimultaneously negates the ecological referent of the commodity as a product of nature.\u201d \n(Kilbourne et al., 1997, p.8) \n \nThis alternative conceptualisation of consumption links with three other parts of the \nmacromarketing literature. First, there is the notion that historic theory construction has been \nanthropocentric whereas (the macromarketing literature claims) there is a need to move towards an \necocentric view in which organisations and the market place \u201conly exist as part of the biosphere\u201d \n(McDonagh, 1998, p.598). Second, this \u201cdeep ecological\u201d strand (Shrivastava, 1997, p.170) is \nsupported by the need to challenge the \u201cdominant social paradigm\u201d \u2013 a \u201csociety\u2019s belief structure \nthat organises the way people perceive and interpret the functioning of the world around them\u201d \n(Milbraith cited in Kilbourne et al., 1997, p.4). Kilbourne et al. expand on this definition as follows: \n \n \u201cThe DSP [dominant social paradigm] in Western industrial societies informs the prevailing \nconception of QOL [quality of life] and provides its justification. This is manifested through \nthe ideology of consumption, which maintains that increasing material well-being provides \nthe basis for QOL. The quest for increasing well-being for a growing world population \nposes the fundamental issue of sustainability: consumption cannot increase indefinitely in a \nfinite world.\u201d (1997, p.5)  \n \nIn order to achieve a change in the dominant social paradigm there is, third, a need to produce a \n\u201ccounter-consumer\u201d culture (Dolan, 2002, p.176), a concept which, potentially, has resonances with \nnotions of \u201cvoluntary simplicity\u201d (Rudmin and Kilbourne, 1996). While in itself a complex concept, \n 7\nAccepted for publication in Journal of Strategic Marketing.  \nPlease do not cite without authors\u2019 permission. \n \nthe definition of voluntary simplicity as \u201csingleness of purpose, sincerity and honesty within, as \nwell as avoidance of exterior clutter, of many possessions irrelevant to the chief purpose of life\u201d \n(ibid., p.167) provides obvious links with ecological concerns and an ecocentric view, and against \nconspicuous and hyper-consumption. \n \nMacromarketing and development \nIt is clear from the above discussion that the macromarketing literature has obvious points of \nconnection with limits-to-growth economics. It appears, however, that only recently has it made \nthese connections explicit and begun to build an expanded macromarketing model that links directly \nwith both environmental and development economics (Kilbourne, 2004). Daly (1999) provides the \nconceptual basis for macromarketing\u2019s ecological concerns with his \u201cuneconomic growth theory\u201d in \nwhich he argues that continued growth in a \u201cfull world\u201d situation (where the macroeconomy \nreaches a level at which it \u2018fills\u2019 the ecosystem that surrounds and sustains it) may be uneconomic \u2013 \nthe costs of growth may be greater than the benefits at this macro level. In such a situation, and \ngiven the unequal levels of development in different countries and parts of the world, there is, he \nargues, a requirement for differentiated growth in which higher growth rates in developing \ncountries can be achieved economically only by lower or even negative growth rates in the \ndeveloped world. \u201cIt is absolutely a waste of time as well as morally backward to preach steady-\nstate doctrines to underdeveloped countries before the overdeveloped countries have taken any \nmeasure to reduce either their own population growth or the growth of their per capita resource \nconsumption\u201d (Daly, 1992, p.148).  \n \nKilbourne (2004) also draws attention to the broader development economics debate, drawing \nparticularly on Sen\u2019s work. Here development, both as process and outcome, is viewed in terms of \nsubstantive freedoms including, \u201celementary capabilities like being able to avoid such deprivations \nas starvation, under-nourishment, escapable morbidity and premature mortality, as well as the \nfreedoms that are associated with being literate and numerate, enjoying political participation and \nuncensored speech and so on\u201d (Sen, 1999, p.36). As part of the process of development a key aspect \nof Sen\u2019s thesis is the role of institutions in enabling such freedoms. Institutions include the market, \nthe political system, the media and so on (ibid., p.142) and it is not only the existence but also the \ncomplementarity of these institutions that is important (ibid., p.116). Thus, as Sen argues, \u201cit is very \nhard indeed to see how any reasonable critic could be against the market mechanism, as such\u201d given \nthat it is \u201ca basic arrangement through which people can interact with each other and undertake \nmutually advantageous activities\u201d (ibid., p.142). But this confidence in the market is tempered by \nthe need for other institutions and public policies (themselves secured through political institutions) \nto provide \u201cconditions in which the opportunities offered by [markets] could be reasonably shared\u201d \n(ibid., p.142). It is precisely concerns over both the lack of such institutions in some cases, and \ninstitutions that promote inappropriate policies in others, that has led to criticisms of the whole \nglobalisation \u2018project\u2019 \u2013 see Stiglitz (2002) for example. \n \nWhile, as indicated above, the exploration of these links between macromarketing and development \nand ecological economics are comparatively recent, Fair Trade provides practical exemplification \nof some of these issues. Fair Trade\u2019s emphasis on economic development in developing countries is \nclearly supportive of differentiated economic growth, even though in developed countries this is \nrelated, at best, to substitution of Fair Trade for equivalent products rather than the reduction in \nconsumption that the macromarketing literature and Daly (1992, 1999) suggest may be necessary \nfor sustainability. Equally, in relation to substantive freedoms, Fair Trade clearly promotes labour \npractices including freedom of association, the payment of fair wages and the promotion of \n 8\nAccepted for publication in Journal of Strategic Marketing.  \nPlease do not cite without authors\u2019 permission. \n \nwomen\u2019s role in economic development \u2013 one of Sen\u2019s concerns in relation to the freedom of \nlabour markets (Sen, 1999, pp.115-116). Fair Trade also, and perhaps particularly, encourages \ninstitution-building through the development of local Fair Trade organisations to the point at which \nthey can compete in the mainstream (see Hayes, forthcoming). Indeed, Hayes\u2019 conclusion is that, \ncontrary to popular belief, \u201cthe ethical consumer and Fair Trade premium are not the core of Fair \nTrade, but the long-term commitment of Fair Trade buyers to local Fair Trade organizations, \nunderpinned by the preference of the ethical consumer, is a valuable, and sometimes essential \ncontribution to the investment required by local organizations and their households to equip \nthemselves with an efficient technology in order to compete in global markets\u201d. In helping to \nachieve such institution-building in developing countries, Fair Trade also supports community \ndevelopment particularly through the provision of the Fair Trade premium which can be applied to \ncommunity projects such as adult education facilities or the upgrade of a clean water supply (see \nFairtrade Foundation, 2005b). \n  \nChanging the dominant social paradigm \nWithin the macromarketing literature, however, there appears to be an unresolved question over \nwhether the significant changes that it promotes as being necessary can be achieved from within the \nexisting dominant social paradigm, or whether such fundamental change can be brought about only \nthrough a challenge from without. Prothero and Fitchett (2000), for example, claim that \u201cone aim \nmust therefore be to establish more fundamental changes to contemporary capitalism and \ncommodity culture by employing the persuasive and communicative qualities of media and \nmarketing practices\u201d (p.46) and it is subsequently evident that they claim that there are \n\u201copportunities within capitalism to exploit commodity culture in such a way that contributes to a \nmore ecologically sound way of life\u201d (p.47, emphasis added). They therefore promote a \u201cgreen \ncommodity discourse\u201d that \u201ccould \u2026 be employed to communicate an alternative set of meanings \nthat promotes less consumption-oriented lifestyles on the premise that quality of life would \nincrease\u201d (p.50). An alternative formulation of the same \u2018from within\u2019 approach can be found in \nMcDonagh (1998) who suggests that sustainable communication may contribute something towards \na solution to problems of hyper-consumption (McDonagh, 1998 and see also McDonagh, 2002).  \n \nKilbourne et al. (1997), however, seem less sure: \u201cIf the solution to the crisis cannot be found \nwithin the DSP, a new paradigm is required in order for truly sustainable consumption to become a \nreality\u201d, although they then acknowledge that \u201c[i]mplementing such a paradigm will be \nproblematic, since this would require a transformation of the economic, political, and technological \ninstitutions that form the DSP and, consequently, a long-term sacrifice on the part of consumers and \nproducers\u201d (p.7). Whether from within or from without the existing paradigm, however, \nmacromarketing seems clear that its role is \u201cto inform society that the institutional emperor has no \necological clothes to wear\u201d (!) \u2013 and this is by way of contrast with micromarketing which is \n\u201ccomplicit\u201d in the \u201cvested interests\u201d and \u201cprofligate consumer society\u201d that maintains the DSP \n(ibid., p.17). \n \nThat these conceptualisations are \u201cfuzzy\u201d, with somewhat vague and ill-defined terms, is \nacknowledged within the literature (see, for example, Prothero and Fitchett, 2000, p.51). However, \nthis inter-related set of concepts is useful in so far as it prescribes a range of issues and provides a \nterminology that allows a discourse around them. The difficulty remains, however, whether such a \ndiscourse is likely to affect existing consumer patterns: \n \n 9\nAccepted for publication in Journal of Strategic Marketing.  \nPlease do not cite without authors\u2019 permission. \n \n\u201cThe implications of the historical development of consumer culture is the very real \ndifficulty, from the position of prescribing programs of action, of bringing about the cultural \nshift that would be required to achieve sustainable consumption. This historical \ndevelopment in Europe and North America entailed the emergence of a new ethic of self \u2026 \nthe essence of self-hood is to be self-transforming, to be amorphous, to seek ever new \nexperiences, and to continually reinvent oneself \u2026 modern consumption is about wanting to \nwant. Its essence is insatiability.\u201d (Dolan, 2002, p.175) \n \nGiven this \u201cvery real difficulty\u201d, the question arises whether any existing \u201cprograms of action\u201d \nmight provide at least the possibility of \u201cbringing about the cultural shift that would be required to \nachieve sustainable consumption\u201d. As noted above, Fair Trade, with its emphasis on sustainable \ndevelopment, its challenge to the dominant social paradigm as it exists in relation to international \ntrade, and with its clear links to the more recent developments in the macromarketing literature \ntowards ecological and development economics, would seem to offer such an example. There seems \nto be little doubt that in its early manifestations Fair Trade did set out with the bold intention of \nbeing a tangible \u201cprogram of action\u201d.  \n \nThe key question to which this paper is addressed, however, is whether, as it has developed from \nniche to mainstream, its capacity to challenge has diminished as the increase in consumer awareness \nhas been countered by a diminution in its radical effectiveness. Has Fair Trade, in effect, been co-\nopted? If so, then we may need to look elsewhere for better models, and Fair Trade may itself need \nto attempt to rediscover its radical edge. Alternatively, of course, as Fair Trade has entered the \nmainstream, the possibility exists that it has maintained its radical edge. If so, is Fair Trade now \nbetter able to influence both cultural norms and international trade practices and thus to go some \nway towards achieving the change in the dominant social paradigm that might help to realise the \npractice of sustainable consumption and help to achieve some, at least, of the substantive freedoms \nthat lead to genuine development? Either way, it is clear that Fair Trade provides an exceptional \ncase study of the kind of issues that the macromarketing literature is seeking to address. It is to that \ncase study that we now turn. \n \nMethod \n \nIn order to make an assessment of the impact of mainstreaming on both the Fair Trade movement \nand the supermarkets, a multi-method approach was adopted. Interviews were arranged with senior \nindividuals at three Fair Trade organisations \u2013 the Fairtrade Foundation, Traidcraft and Caf\u00e9direct. \nThe web-sites of the supermarkets were also investigated to assess the level and content of their \ndisclosure on Fair Trade issues and an analysis of their retail offerings was undertaken. \n \nInterviews were then held with those senior individuals who were most closely involved with Fair \nTrade in the four key supermarkets that emerged from the research to that point \u2013 the Co-operative, \nSainsbury\u2019s, Tesco and Waitrose. These interviews took place when other data had been collected \nand analysed and provided an opportunity to question the supermarkets about their motivation and \nlevels of activity in relation to Fair Trade and to assess the effect Fair Trade was having on their \nown practices and their view of how it was impacting upon consumers. Finally, an opportunity \npresented itself to interview a senior individual in an additional Fair Trade organisation \u2013 Day \n 10\nAccepted for publication in Journal of Strategic Marketing.  \nPlease do not cite without authors\u2019 permission. \n \nChocolate Company. This proved to be a valuable addition to the research and the findings are \nincluded here within the next section.7 \n \nInterviews with the Fair Trade organisations and some reflection \n \nThe radical edge of Fair Trade was confirmed in that, in all four interviews with Fair Trade \norganisations, the focus on marginalised producers in developing countries was emphasised. Fair \nTrade is about market access, sustainable livelihoods and empowerment for these producers and in \nits purest form is about remodelling the supply chain in such a way that these producers not only \ngain access to northern markets but are also enabled to trade successfully in them. At the same time, \nhowever, there was a strong focus on the market \/ consumer aspects of Fair Trade with an \nacknowledgement that Fair Trade is in a sense captive to the market \u2013 there is no point providing \nproducts that would not sell, or would sell only in limited quantities \u2013 and in that sense, as one \ninterviewee put it, Fair Trade \u201cis kidding itself if it thinks it is changing market fundamentals\u201d. \n \nThe mainstreaming of Fair Trade food products was seen in a positive light; it had enabled \nsignificant increases in volume for the producers and had thus enabled the extension of the concept \ninto channels and to consumers previously untouched by it. The FLO standards and certification \nprocesses and the Fairtrade Mark were seen as key to this since they provided protection from any \ndiminution in standards, coupled with a consumer guarantee that had become established and was \ntrusted. The Fairtrade Mark currently has a 50% consumer recognition level (Fairtrade Foundation, \n2005c), up from 39% in 2004 and 25% in 2003 \u2013 a remarkable rise \u2013 and it was thought unlikely \nthat any supermarket would launch an own-label Fair Trade product without it, although the Co-\noperative and Waitrose were believed to be able to do so with some credibility should they so \nchoose.8  \n \nThere had, however, been some limited signs of supermarkets challenging the Fairtrade Mark \nstandards or not applying them in quite such a rigorous way as the Fair Trade organisations \nthemselves would do. Thus the level and availability of support for producers was often less from \nthe supermarkets, and there was a lower commitment to the long-term producer relationships that \nare a fundamental part of the Fair Trade relationship. Although no significant de-listings of products \nhad taken place so far9, there was a recognition and acceptance that this would be a fact of life in \ndealing with the mainstream. This left the Fair Trade organisations with the responsibilities of \nproviding the support to the producers themselves and also trying to maintain the long-term \nrelationships. On the positive side, there was some evidence of a reinforcement of standards with \none supermarket choosing to deal only through Caf\u00e9direct because of its direct relationships with \nproducers which go beyond FLO standards. \n                                            \n7 The discussion derives from these interviews which were conducted as follows, all dates being 2004: Fairtrade \nFoundation (19 April); Traidcraft (23 April); Caf\u00e9direct (20 May); Co-op (25 August); Waitrose (22 September); Tesco \n(23 September); Sainsbury\u2019s (23 September); and Day Chocolate (14 October). In order to preserve the anonymity of \nthe interviewees and protect the organisations, general points are not attributed. \n8 The Co-operative has, however, retailed own-label \u201cFair Trade\u201d wines without the Fairtrade Mark but with \nTraidcraft\u2019s name to provide reassurance and prior to the FairTrade Mark being awarded - see further below. Similarly, \nTesco retails Traidcraft\u2019s tinned pineapple, which has yet to receive the Fairtrade Mark. This, however, is not an own-\nlabel product. \n9 De-listings occur when a supermarket decides that a product is no longer worth the shelf-space it occupies and would \nbe better employed stocking another product. These are a regular feature of supermarket activity so that the lack of \nsignificant de-listings could be regarded as a positive sign of Fair Trade\u2019s ability to hold its own with other highly \ncompetitive products. \n 11\nAccepted for publication in Journal of Strategic Marketing.  \nPlease do not cite without authors\u2019 permission. \n \n \nThe influence that Fair Trade organisations have had on the mainstream was viewed partly as direct \nand commercial in that the supermarkets now \u201cpull\u201d Fair Trade products through the system \nwhereas there was a requirement in the early days to \u201cpush\u201d products to obtain listings. Getting the \nsupermarkets to take Fair Trade seriously (and hence to understand it to some extent) was clearly \nregarded as a success. The wider influence that Fair Trade seeks to achieve, however, was harder to \nassess and there was some feeling that any impact that had been achieved was through an \ninvolvement with the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) which addresses supply chain conditions in \ngeneral and was therefore likely to have wider impact.10 The question of the size of Fair Trade \norganisations was addressed by Day Chocolate following a comment in the supermarket interviews \n(see below), and the view was expressed that they needed to remain small and focused in order to \nmaintain the credibility of Fair Trade and the Fairtrade Mark. \n \nIn relation to the \u201cbundle of characteristics\u201d (Lancaster, 1966)11 that are represented in a Fair Trade \nproduct it was accepted that these are highly complex. The focus, however, is on the inherent \nquality of the product coupled with strong elements of social and economic justice that are \nreinforced through the FLO standards which include sections on social and economic development \nand a separate section on labour conditions. Environmental considerations are present within the \n\u201cbundle\u201d in that each FLO standard has a section on environmental development which includes a \nrequirement to implement a system of \u201cIntegrated Crop Management\u201d, and to comply with national \nand international legislation regarding the use of pesticides, the protection of natural waters, virgin \nforest and other ecosystems of high ecological value, erosion and waste management. FLO \nstandards also encourage producers to work towards organic certification, but do not require it.  \n \nWith such a complex array of characteristics it is not surprising that the Fair Trade organisations \nfelt that getting this message across to consumers was not without difficulty. Partly this is to do \nwith the fact that this message does not \u2018belong\u2019 in today\u2019s society \u2013 the Fair Trade message in \nrelation to food products could be thought of in terms of \u201chelp us to rig the market in favour of \ngenuinely poor farmers\u201d and this is both difficult to convey and contentious when northern \nconsumers are already acutely aware of \u201crigged\u201d agricultural markets. There was some concern \nover the potential confusion in consumers\u2019 minds when faced with so many product labels but a \nfeeling that the Fairtrade Mark was sufficiently clear and well-established for any confusion to be \nlimited. Consumers were thought to fall into three categories: the informed and committed; those \nwith a low level of understanding and interest; and those in between. Generally, consumer \nunderstanding was thought to lag activity in terms of the purchasing of Fair Trade goods (though \nFair Trade organisations presumably prefer this to the alternative!).  \n                                            \n10 The Ethical Trading Initiative was established in January 1998 with the support of the UK Government\u2019s Department \nfor International Development (DFID) to help develop and encourage the use of widely endorsed standards, embodied \nin codes of conduct, monitoring and auditing methods, to improve labour conditions around the world. Membership \nconsists of firms (including most of the Supermarkets), Non-Governmental Organisations like Christian Aid, and \nTrades Unions. See www.ethicaltrade.org. \n11 Lancaster\u2019s seminal paper within the economics literature introduced the idea that a good is purchased not for itself \nbut for the bundle of characteristics that the good represents. Since different characteristics may be obtained, often in \ndiffering amounts, from competing goods, consumers are faced with choosing both which characteristics they prefer \nand how to make an efficient choice  - how to maximise the bundle of chosen characteristics for the minimum price. \nMarketing theory, of course, uses much the same idea with the concept of \u201cbenefit segmentation\u201d capable of being \ntraced back to a similar time as Lancaster\u2019s article (Haley, 1968). More recently, Kotler\u2019s presentation of product levels \n(core, basic, expected, augmented and potential - Kotler, 2000, pp.394-396) together with the associated concept of \nproduct attributes (see, for example, Crittenden et al., 2002), provide legitimacy to Lancaster\u2019s original conception. \n 12\nAccepted for publication in Journal of Strategic Marketing.  \nPlease do not cite without authors\u2019 permission. \n \n \nOne way of understanding the Fair Trade message that was mentioned in the interviews is in \nrelation to reducing the \u201cdistance\u201d between consumers and producers. This has been discussed \nelsewhere in the literature. In commenting on food products, Raynolds noted that, \u201c[i]f alternative \nproducts enter existing market circuits, their environmental and social qualities become \nsubordinated to their price, as occurs with other commodities. Friedmann (1993) suggests that the \nway to counter this market discipline is to reduce the huge social distance that exists between \nproducers and consumers\u201d (Raynolds, 2000, p.299). She reinforced this point by arguing that \n\u201ctheoretically it is in the process of capitalist exchange that commodities become abstracted from \ntheir human and natural roots, so that price becomes their dominant characteristic\u201d and hence \ncontended that Fair Trade initiatives \u201chave begun to create new networks of exchange that escape \nthe bonds of simple price competition\u201d (ibid. p.306). This concept of networks reducing social \ndistance is discussed further in Raynolds\u2019 subsequent article in which she investigated \u201chow the \nhuge social and spatial distances between Northern consumers and Southern producers might be \n\u2018shortened\u2019 within Fair Trade networks\u201d (Raynolds, 2002, p.404). This, of course, links directly \nwith the macromarketing concern about hyper-consumption where the consumption act becomes \nabstracted from the product being consumed.  \n \nHowever, Wright\u2019s insightful critique of Caf\u00e9direct\u2019s advertising campaign between 1999 and 2002 \nsuggests an alternative interpretation. She concludes that, \u201ca prominent reading [of this campaign] \nis that minority [developed or northern] world consumers can \u2018redeem\u2019 majority [developing or \nsouthern] world producers by perpetuating lifestyles prioritising self-gratification. Moreover, that \nthe lives and landscapes of the majority world are consumables in their own right, alongside cash \ncrops \u2026 My reading is that the campaign may encourage respect for difference, in the name of \nfairness or through invoking common human concerns, but it simultaneously invites consumption \nof difference confirming the \u2018superiority\u2019 of the minority world consumer\u201d (Wright, 2004, p.678). \nThis may be a rather extreme view, but it should at least act as a warning that in reducing distance \nthere remains the potential for conspicuous or hyper-consumption rather than a genuine \u201cnetwork of \nexchange\u201d. \n \nFrom a strategic marketing perspective it is therefore important to transmit to consumers what \nStrong (1997, p.36) described as the \u201ccommunication of the human element of sustainability\u201d. \nNicholls (2002, p.13), in operationalising Strong\u2019s framework, suggested that brand building and \ninformation dissemination are required in order to achieve this. It seems clear, from the interviews \nwith the Fair Trade organisations, that they perceive themselves as engaging in exactly this task of \ncommunication, information dissemination and brand building in order to get the Fair Trade \nmessage across. Caf\u00e9direct, for example, had declined to become an own-label supplier as it wanted \nto focus on developing its own brand. Associated with this, however, is the danger inherent within \nbrand-building that it creates just the \u201cdistancing\u201d effect that Fair Trade seeks to diminish. One \ninterviewee acknowledged the possibility that Fair Trade could become a \u201clifestyle\u201d choice which \nenables consumers to make a good \u201cpolitical\u201d statement while also believing that they are helping \npoor people. To avoid this danger, of course, requires the communication of a very clear message \nboth to the supermarkets and to consumers. The question that arises, then, is whether they are \nsucceeding \u2013 and in order to answer that we need to look at Fair Trade from the supermarkets\u2019 \nperspective. \n \nSupermarkets and their approach to Fair Trade \n \n 13\nAccepted for publication in Journal of Strategic Marketing.  \nPlease do not cite without authors\u2019 permission. \n \nHow, then, do the supermarkets approach Fair Trade? Although the growth figures and projections \npresented above are impressive, the first point to acknowledge is that Fair Trade, with a relatively \nlimited product range (over 350 products according to Fairtrade Foundation (2005a and see also \n2005d and further below) but across only 12 product categories12) represents a very small part of \nthe products on offer in supermarket chains. Tesco, for example, stocks around 20,000 food lines. \nThis raises the question as to why supermarkets should become involved at all in this niche market. \nThe answer appears to be a combination of factors. Firstly, from a commercial perspective, ethical \nproducts in general and Fair Trade products in particular, are showing growth in markets that are \ngenerally mature and static \u2013 U.K. coffee consumption has shrunk by 2% in six years, for example \n(Guardian, 2004a). Hence, mainstream players cannot afford not to be involved.13 Secondly, as far \nas certain supermarkets are concerned, Fair Trade fits with their own ethos and, as such, represents \na natural extension of their product range.  \n \nCorporate disclosure of Fair Trade \nAn initial analysis was conducted to assess the extent and content of corporate disclosure about Fair \nTrade. In order to do this, corporate web-sites were inspected.14 The web-sites of all supermarkets \nthat potentially stock Fair Trade products (see Fairtrade Foundation, 2005d) were inspected and a \nsite search was performed for \u201cFairtrade\u201d and \u201cfair trade\u201d (see Table 2) and from this a summary of \ndisclosure, in simple binary form relating to high and low disclosers, was produced (see Table 1).   \n \nNo \/ minimal Fair \nTrade information \nFair Trade information  \nand policy statements \nAsda Co-operative \nBooths Sainsbury\u2019s \nBudgens Tesco \nIceland Waitrose \nMorrisons  \nSafeway  \nSomerfield  \nSpar  \n  \nTable 1  Summary of web-site disclosure \n \nThe highest level of disclosure was given by the Co-operative, followed by Sainsbury\u2019s, Tesco and \nWaitrose, which all provided a similar level \u2013 see Table 2. The Co-operative\u2019s support of Fair Trade \nis encapsulated in its coffee policy: \u201cas a business driven by co-operative values, we are committed \n                                            \n12 The categories accord approximately with the FLO categories (see Note 2 above) and are: chocolate\/cocoa; coffee; \nfruit juice; fresh fruit; honey; nuts & snacks, preserves & spreads; sugar; tea; wine\/beer; sportsballs; and roses. In the \nmore detailed list of separate products 22 different categories \/ sub-categories are recorded (Fairtrade Foundation, \n2005d). \n13 Nestl\u00e9 \u201cis believed to be planning to test a premium \u201cfair trade\u201d coffee brand carrying the Nescaf\u00e9 name in the U.K., \nwith a global rollout to follow\u201d (Laurel, 2004) and Marks & Spencer\u2019s 198 Caf\u00e9 Revives have switched all coffee to be \nFairtrade Mark certified (Fairtrade Foundation, 2004).

Four definitions of Fair Trade were provided (see Figure 3) and might be \ncompared with the FINE definition given above. \n \nCo-operative: Fair trade seeks to guarantee a better deal for the world's most disadvantaged growers \nand small-scale producers. Aimed primarily at marginalized independent growers and producers in \nthe world's poorest countries, fair trade ensures they receive payment that exceeds the market place \nnorm and includes an additional premium to support producer development programmes. \n \nSainsbury\u2019s: Fairtrade is aimed at small, marginalised and disadvantaged producers. These are often \nsmall scale farmers, or independent plantations. It focuses on working with the producer, to allow \ncapacity building and providing export opportunities to those suppliers who would not otherwise \nhave access to them. It also involves ensuring that the terms and conditions of trading with the \nsupplier enable them to maintain and develop good social and environmental conditions. \n \nTesco: Fairtrade is about fair terms of trade, local sustainability, better prices, and decent working \nconditions, enabling producers to improve their lot and have more control over their lives. By \nrequiring companies to pay above market prices, Fairtrade addresses the injustices of world trade, \nwhich traditionally discriminates against the poorest, weakest producers. Fairtrade is not about \ncharity. It is about a better deal for third world producers, because when they are paid a fair price \nthey don't need charity. \n  \nWaitrose: When global commodity prices fall, they can have a direct impact on small-scale \nproducers in developing countries. Many are forced into debt while others may lose their land and \ntheir homes. Consumers can help by buying Fairtrade products \u2026 The Fairtrade Foundation ensures \na better deal for disadvantaged producers. [An extended description of Fairtrade standards is then \nprovided.]  \n \n \nFigure 3  Supermarket definitions of Fair Trade \n \nWhile using different words there is clearly a reasonable degree of conformity on the main \ncharacteristics of Fair Trade between the retailers and with the FINE definition. It is particularly \ninteresting that Tesco, the most commercial of the supermarkets, specifically mentions and \nelaborates on the injustices of world trade. \n \nWhile all four supermarkets recognise the social premium paid to Fair Trade producers it is \ninteresting that Sainsbury\u2019s explicitly links this to why Fair Trade products are more expensive: \n\u201cthis (social) premium is reflected in the cost paid by the customer\u201d. This raises the question as to \nwho is the real supporter of Fair Trade \u2013 the supermarket and the customer jointly or just the \ncustomer prepared to pay more. The Co-operative, Tesco and Waitrose report the social premium, \nbut in the absence of any price-related impact and so focused entirely on producer benefits.  \n \n 16\nAccepted for publication in Journal of Strategic Marketing.  \nPlease do not cite without authors\u2019 permission. \n \nSainsbury\u2019s Fair Trade policy widens the role of Fair Trade from a corporate perspective by using \nFair Trade within its overall Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) framework as follows: \u201cthe \ncommitment to Fairtrade products forms a key part of Sainsbury\u2019s strategy for Socially Responsible \nsourcing\u2026(and) overall commitment to Corporate Social Responsibility\u201d. Whilst Fair Trade can \nfacilitate a company\u2019s commitment to CSR, Sainsbury\u2019s and the Co-operative clearly distinguish \nFair Trade from other forms of CSR trading, principally the difference between Ethical Trade \n(based on the ETI) and Fair Trade. This is important as part of identifying the Fair Trade message, \nso that it is not confused in an amalgam of CSR trading, combining ethical, fair and organically \ntraded products. Waitrose, however, which has not joined the ETI on the basis that its own \nresponsible sourcing policy is an improvement on ETI\u2019s, states that, \u201cWhile Waitrose is working \ntowards the ultimate goal of ensuring all its own-label products are traded fairly, it is also \nsupporting recognised schemes, such as Fairtrade \u2026\u201d (Corporate Social Responsibility report 2004, \npp.26-27, available via their web-site). This would seem to have the potential to confuse rather than \nclarify, even if the ultimate ambition is laudable. \n \nAs part of this Fair Trade identity, all four supermarkets draw attention to their use of the Fairtrade \nMark as a labelling device guaranteeing the standard. For example, Tesco states: \u201cThe Fairtrade \nMark is an independent consumer label which guarantees a better deal for third world workers and \nproducers. The Mark is awarded by the Fairtrade Foundation\u201d. This gives Fair Trade products an \nidentity (aside from any associated branding such as Caf\u00e9direct, Clipper or Percol) with which \nconsumers can associate. However, when a market-led labelling approach is adopted it may give \nrise to problems. The example of Fair Trade roses, which has become something of a cause celebre \nwithin the Fair Trade movement, is a case in point. \n \nThe case of Fair Trade roses  \nThere has been concern within the Fair Trade movement, (although it is difficult to find any hard \nevidence), over the introduction by Tesco of Fair Trade flowers in general and roses in particular.16 \nThe concern seems to focus first on the development of a FLO standard for flowers ahead of other \nproducts that were, apparently, before them in the queue for standard development. The implication \nseems to be that Tesco used its commercial influence to jump the queue. Second, there seems to be \nsome concern at the Kenyan source for these flowers which apparently uses a company where \nworker exploitation has previously been identified and involves plantation-style farming. This may \nbe somewhat at odds with the common conception of Fair Trade involving individual producer \nhouseholds or artisans, although FLO does provide standards for hired labour to cover such \nproduction. Discussion in the magazine Ethical Consumer (2004a, p.38 and 2004b, p.4) on this \npoint was inconclusive but suggests that \u201calthough [labour] conditions have improved in response \nto international campaigning, they may well not fit many people\u2019s ideas of what a Fairtrade product \nis\u201d. In other words, there is concern that the FLO standards may not have been applied as rigorously \nas they should be in awarding the Fairtrade Mark. Third, there is concern that the pricing of these \nproducts is at the minimum Fair Trade mark-up from commercial prices. Fourth, the packaging for \nthis product has very limited information about the sourcing of the product and, by incorporating \nthe largely black and white of the Fairtrade Mark into mainly black and white packaging, suggests \nthe possibility of an appropriation of the Fairtrade Mark. Figure 4 demonstrates this effect and also \nallows a comparison with the Tesco \u201ceasy peeler\u201d citrus Fair Trade product where the packaging is \nsimilar but there is explicit reference to FLO standards. The danger here, of course, is that such an \n                                            \n16 Sainsbury\u2019s followed Tesco in retailing Fair Trade flowers, but the original concern arose over Tesco\u2019s introduction \nof these products. \n 17\nAccepted for publication in Journal of Strategic Marketing.  \nPlease do not cite without authors\u2019 permission. \n \n 18\n                                           \napproach, if true and extended more generally to other products, could have a deleterious effect on \nother supermarkets\u2019 perception of Fair Trade and the Fairtrade Mark, as well as affecting consumer \nperceptions. It is precisely these kinds of concern that have led to the charges of \u201csubversion\u201d, \n\u201cdilution\u201d, \u201credefinition\u201d or \u201creabsorption\u201d mentioned above. \n \nThe Fairtrade Foundation, in answer to these criticisms (Fairtrade Foundation, 2005b), responded \nthat, far from jumping the queue, standards for Fair Trade flowers had been in development since \n1999 and flowers had already been on sale in Switzerland since 2001 \u2013 prior to the Tesco launch. In \ncorrespondence with one of the authors17, it acknowledged that one of the certified farms in Kenya \nhad a previous history of failing to respect workers\u2019 rights, but stated that it was widely accepted \nthat there have been major improvements in the past two to three years \u2013 precisely what Fair Trade \nis for in improving the position of marginalised and disadvantaged producers including those on \nlarge plantations. The packaging complies with all the rules for the use of the Fairtrade Mark and \naligns it with Tesco\u2019s \u201cFinest\u201d range \u2013 thereby not marginalising Fair Trade within Tesco and \nsupporting the notion that Fair Trade is about quality. The Fairtrade Foundation, therefore, saw \nTesco\u2019s packaging approach as demonstrating their commitment to making the Fair Trade range \nwork. In conclusion, the Fairtrade Foundation\u2019s published commentary (2005b) states: \u201cSupporters \nof Fairtrade can be assured that flowers operate to the same level of standards and certification as \nall other products that carry the Fairtrade Mark\u201d.\n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n17 E-mail correspondence 16-18 November 2004. \nAccepted for publication in Journal of Strategic Marketing.  \nPlease do not cite without authors\u2019 permission. \n \nFigure 4  Tesco packaging for Fair Trade roses compared with easy peeler citrus \n \nTesco\u2019s response to the criticisms rests similarly on the application of the Fairtrade Mark: if the \nMark is granted, the product is genuinely Fair Trade. However, Tesco also felt that the development \nof the FLO standard for flowers, despite the 18 months it had taken, had been \u201cthe most important \nthing Tesco could have done for Fair Trade\u201d because not only did it introduce a new product \ncategory but did so on the basis of consumer demand and so introduced FLO to a market-led (as \nopposed to its traditional product-led) approach. Within this particular case lies, perhaps, the \nessence of the dilemma facing Fair Trade. \n \nInterviews with the supermarkets \n \nAs indicated above, interviews were held with those senior individuals who were most closely \ninvolved with Fair Trade in the four key supermarkets \u2013 the Co-operative, Sainsbury\u2019s, Tesco and \nWaitrose. In relation to their various motivations for engaging with Fair Trade these were much as \nexpected. The Co-operative cited the link with their own principles, the fact that many producer \norganisations are themselves co-operatives and backed this by acknowledging concerns about the \nnegative effects of globalisation and poverty reduction. These motivations were reinforced both by \nthe sub-committee of the Board that advises on the implementation of co-operative principles and \nby the Co-operative\u2019s members. Waitrose similarly cited their own partnership structure and \ncorporate ethos so that Fair Trade \u2018fits\u2019 both in terms of values and commercially. Sainsbury\u2019s also \ncited an alignment of Fair Trade with their own values, but then added that Fair Trade fitted with a \ndifferentiation strategy and that Fair Trade products must demonstrate that they are worthy of shelf \nspace. While this would also be true for the other supermarkets, the slightly more commercial \nstance is clear. Tesco, perhaps not surprisingly, responded with the most commercial approach. \nTheir motivations for engaging with Fair Trade were threefold: customer interest; a commercial \nopportunity in the commodity markets that the Fair Trade product range supplies; and \ndemonstration of social responsibility. It was claimed that Tesco\u2019s engagement was not a reflection \nsolely of responding to consumer demand, although there was obvious satisfaction in the fact that \nFair Trade now \u201cover-indexes\u201d (i.e. has a greater market share of Fair Trade goods at 33.4% than \nTesco\u2019s average market share of 28.8%18). The fact that around one-third of supermarket-related \nFair Trade goods is channelled through one supermarket may give pause for thought in relation to \nmarket power.  \n \nIn response to questions concerning the influence of Fair Trade on their own sourcing practices both \nthe Co-operative and Waitrose acknowledged such impact and the Co-operative felt that Fair Trade \nhad more generally affected the sourcing policies of supermarkets. Sainsbury\u2019s response focused \nmore on the effect of the ETI than on Fair Trade\u2019s influence, with Fair Trade being seen as having \nhad more impact on the marketing side, in getting the message across to consumers, than on the \nsourcing side. Tesco was similarly content to refer to its long-standing support for ETI and to state \nits contentment with its own sourcing practices and would not be drawn on whether Fair Trade had \ninfluenced the mainstream in relation to its trading practices. \n \nWhether Fair Trade had been affected by its association with the mainstream was not easy for the \nsupermarkets to answer. Certainly all the supermarkets confirmed their commitment to the Fairtrade \n                                            \n18 These figures were given verbally at the interview and are not necessarily current. \nAccepted for publication in Journal of Strategic Marketing.  \nPlease do not cite without authors\u2019 permission. \n \nMark, despite in some cases considerable frustrations such as product development bottlenecks \ndriven by producer need. Sainsbury\u2019s thought that the assurance it provided was one of the best at \npresent. There was some concern that the Fair Trade organisations had displayed some naivety in \ntheir approach to the mainstream and that this would need to be monitored closely in order to \nmaintain the robustness and credibility of the Mark. But generally there was an acknowledgment \nthat Fair Trade\u2019s standards had been accepted by the supermarkets and thus the Fair Trade concept \nhad not been directly affected by its involvement with the mainstream. The Fairtrade Mark would \ncontinue to be used although exceptions to this might occur. The Co-operative, for example, might \nseek to introduce further new product ranges for which there were currently no FLO standards \navailable, as it had done with fairly traded wine in association with Traidcraft until the FLO \nstandard had become available. Tesco\u2019s view was that it would continue to work with the Fairtrade \nMark.  \n \nAn interesting divergence of views emerged, however, in relation to the future direction of Fair \nTrade. Unsurprisingly all supermarkets were positive about the mainstreaming of Fair Trade. Tesco \nfelt that, with its market share and demographic profile, it has the ability to turn Fair Trade from a \n\u201cbourgeois\u201d concern into one that appealed across the full range of consumers and clearly this \nwould lead to increased volume. This would move the Fair Trade consumer profile away from one \nbased on price and exclusivity towards a broader but more price-conscious consumer profile. \nWaitrose, however, took the opposite view. Fair Trade had a clear niche and should continue to \nconcentrate on disadvantaged producers in the developing world rather than on the demands of \nconsumers in developed countries. The Fair Trade movement needed to be of sufficient size to be \nable to influence the mainstream, but it could have that influence without needing to continue to \ngrow. There could be a danger in \u201cfollowing the volume\u201d, partly in relation to ensuring supply \nchains, but also in the possible dilution of the concept. This was particularly related to Fair Trade \nbecoming a commodity, whereas Waitrose argued that it needed to retain its ability to provide \ndifferentiated products. While the Co-operative did not express the same concerns about continued \ngrowth of Fair Trade, and confirmed its own commitment to continue to extend its product range \nparticularly through composite products that use Fair Trade ingredients, it did confirm that Fair \nTrade should be \u201cabout the primary producer and the product\u201d and that there was a danger of \n\u201cselling out to the carrot of volume\u201d.  \n \nIn relation to the bundle of characteristics that customers are purchasing when they buy a Fair Trade \nproduct, there was a general consensus among the supermarkets. Given that, traditionally, Fair \nTrade customers could be classified as from the AB socio-demographic groups19, or from the \n\u201cliberal middle-class\u201d with \u201cslightly higher values\u201d, there was general agreement that they were \nseeking to purchase better than average product quality with perhaps some understanding that \nsmaller production runs and sourcing from the developed world justified the premium price. \nBeyond that, however, customers were perceived as buying a rather vague combination of \ncharacteristics: \u201csomething that makes a difference\u201d; \u201ca salve to conscience\u201d; \u201ca belief that they are \nsaving the world\u201d; \u201cease of conscience\u201d; \u201cdoing good for others\u201d; \u201cbetter for someone down the \nline\u201d were some of the phrases that were used. Asked, for example, whether they thought customers \nknew where the social premium associated with Fair Trade products was used for, Sainsbury\u2019s \nthought that they did not. In general, this set of responses seems to suggest that Fair Trade has not \n                                            \n19 Bird & Hughes (1997) and Nicholls (2002) both use published consumer data to analyse the \u201cethical consumer\u201d and \nwhile AB socio-demographic groups predominated in earlier studies there is evidence of a broadening of this to other \nsocio-demographic groups. Tesco\u2019s and the Co-operative\u2019s engagement with Fair Trade is clearly a factor here. \n 20\nAccepted for publication in Journal of Strategic Marketing.  \nPlease do not cite without authors\u2019 permission. \n \ngot its message across sufficiently and, despite the level of recognition of the Fairtrade Mark, the \nlevel of consumer understanding is thought to be limited. \n \nAsked whether Fair Trade\u2019s environmental credentials were adequate the majority view (one \nsupermarket did not comment) was that they were not. It was recognised that Fair Trade had \nprioritised social justice issues, but there was a feeling that this was now becoming insufficient and \nthat more priority had to be given to strengthening the environmental aspects of Fair Trade \u2013 \nalthough there was some recognition that this was already occurring. Links with the organic \nmovement were seen as important with Sainsbury\u2019s suggesting that an integrated Fair Trade \/ \norganic label would be both feasible and desirable so long as it did not undermine the credibility of \nthe product. \n \nIn relation to notions of sustainable consumption three of the four supermarkets (the fourth did not \ncomment) agreed that Fair Trade does not \u2018touch\u2019 this agenda: \u201cit is not about not eating chocolate, \nbut about eating fairly traded chocolate when you do\u201d \u2013 the substitution effect noted above. One \nview was that the further Fair Trade went into the mainstream the less impact it would have on \nculture. The only part of the consumption agenda that is an issue for Fair Trade is the \u201chealthy \neating\u201d aspect, and this tends to be problematic given that tea, coffee, chocolate, sugar and wine are \nsome of the key products. However, there was an acknowledgement that Fair Trade is tackling this \nwith, for example, lower sugar content in products such as Muesli. \n \nAn assessment of the supermarkets\u2019 engagement with Fair Trade \n \nIt seems clear from the above description of the supermarkets\u2019 disclosure with regard to Fair Trade \nand the information obtained from the interviews that, for four supermarkets at least, their \nengagement with Fair Trade is a serious one. It is clear that the Co-operative leads the way in terms \nof their commitment to the concept of Fair Trade, their web-site disclosure, the number of products \nstocked and, in particular, their own-brand range. In terms of ideological commitment, Waitrose is \nclearly second even though this is not represented in the breadth of their product range. Sainsbury\u2019s \napproach was awaiting confirmation within the overall review of the business that was being \nconducted, but it may be that Fair Trade takes a more prominent place if it is believed that it would \nassist in whatever features of a differentiation strategy emerge. Tesco is clearly the least committed \nideologically but, potentially at least, the most committed commercially. As Tesco adds further \nproduct lines to a range that already \u201cover-indexes\u201d it looks set to continue to be able to claim that it \nis the U.K.\u2019s number one Fair Trade retailer by volume. Viewed from the perspective of \nperformance over commitment, then, Tesco and the Co-operative would come out in the lead, given \ntheir success in making Fair Trade work against comparatively unhelpful customer socio-\ndemographics.  \n \nThe supermarkets\u2019 definitions of Fair Trade and the use, and promotion of, the Fairtrade Mark, \nsuggest that, if anything, they have accepted Fair Trade at face value, and hence any concern that \nthe concept might be in danger of serious dilution, whatever view is taken of the Fair Trade flowers \ncase, would seem, on the evidence presented here, to be largely unwarranted. \n \nDiscussion and conclusions \n \nThe importance to the Fair Trade movement of withstanding commercial pressures that might, in \nany way, dilute the concept seems clear. Holding to the FLO standards and the rigorous application \n 21\nAccepted for publication in Journal of Strategic Marketing.  \nPlease do not cite without authors\u2019 permission. \n \nof the Fairtrade Mark in such a way as to ensure the purity of the concept is clearly important not \njust for \u2018internal\u2019 purposes but also in retaining the confidence of the supermarkets and consumers \nalike. At the same time, however, it would appear that Fair Trade needs to convey its message more \ncogently so that consumers are clearer about what they are purchasing and know why they are \ndoing so, why there is an associated premium price and what happens to the Fair Trade premium. \nThis \u201cdistance-reducing\u201d communication strategy is, in itself, an onerous strategic marketing \nchallenge through which Fair Trade must seek to simplify and convey a complex concept without \nover-simplifying it to the extent that consumers are faced with bland generalisations and continue to \nbelieve that they are in some vague sense \u201csaving the world\u201d.  \n \nFair Trade does not seek to promote either conspicuous or hyper-consumption and both existing and \nfuture \u201cdistance-reducing\u201d communication strategies, therefore, need to continue to seek to ensure \nthat there is \u201ca logical connection between the thing consumed and the consumption act itself\u201d so \nthat it is never a case of \u201cthe image being consumed, rather than the object\u201d (Kilbourne, 1997, p.8, \ncited above). Similarly, there must be concern over any strategic marketing approach which simply \nperpetuates lifestyles that prioritise self-gratification (Wright, 2004). This, however, raises an \ninteresting tension. As Fair Trade brands seek to establish themselves in consumers\u2019 minds they \ncould, as noted above, have the effect of becoming \u2018lifestyle\u2019 choices \u2013 the Fair Trade image could \nbecome, in a sense, more important than the product itself. This might lead to a further stratification \nof the market with a group of relatively well-informed but fickle consumers who buy the products \nfor what the Fair Trade movement would see as the wrong reasons \u2013 for conspicuous or even hyper-\nconsumption. This, however, underlines the difficulty for Fair Trade of needing to employ \nconventional \u201cmicromarketing\u201d techniques to promote its products, while conveying its radical \nmessage at the same time. \n \nIn relation to the macromarketing literature it would appear that Fair Trade offers something by way \nof progress towards sustainable consumption despite the contrary views of most of the \nsupermarkets. Fair Trade products do, to some extent, \u201crespond to basic needs\u201d and certainly in a \nway that \u201cbrings a better quality of life\u201d (Dolan, 2002, p.172, cited above) to producers. There is an \nextent to which Fair Trade\u2019s underlying purpose is to alter the \u201cdominant social paradigm\u201d by \nchallenging the hegemony of the market, but it is clear that its ability to influence the mainstream, \ndespite working closely with it over a number of years, is limited \u2013 the two supermarkets that \nacknowledged any influence were those which already had strong ideological motivations for \nsupporting Fair Trade. It is also clear that there is some, but perhaps not enough, attention within \nFair Trade to \u201cminimising the use of natural resources, toxic materials and emissions of waste and \npollutants over the life cycle\u201d (ibid., p.172), and it would certainly be reasonable to conclude that \nFair Trade has promoted an anthropocentric over an ecocentric view of the world. The \nsupermarkets\u2019 majority view that Fair Trade needs to do more on the environmental front is surely \ncorrect although any suggestion that this might be at the expense of its anthropocentric focus would \nseem to be misplaced. Fair Trade remains committed to its primary focus on the social and \neconomic development of marginalised producers in developing countries. \n \nAny link between Fair Trade and notions of a counter-consumer culture or of voluntary simplicity, \nhowever, would seem to be somewhat tenuous. This raises the question as to whether any approach \nthat seeks to work alongside the mainstream, and to an extent therefore becomes dependent upon it, \ncan ever seriously challenge the dominant social paradigm. As one commentator has put it, \u201c\u2026 \neven ethical purchases is still seeing shopping as the solution to global problems\u201d (Davidson, 2004, \np.15). Perhaps one relevant challenge to Fair Trade, levelled by Waitrose and further discussed in \n 22\nAccepted for publication in Journal of Strategic Marketing.  \nPlease do not cite without authors\u2019 permission. \n \nthe interview with Day Chocolate, is for it to seek to remain small and pure, not to follow the \n\u201ccarrot of volume\u201d but, by rejecting the notion that growth is always good, live out a different \napproach. The reaction of marginalised producers to a strategy that would seem to limit their \nvolume might well be hostile. Nor, at first sight, is this in line with Daly\u2019s (1992) view of the need \nfor differentiated growth although it might make a limited contribution to Daly\u2019s (1999) larger \nconceptions of reduced growth in the developed world and of the requirements of \u201cfull world\u201d \neconomics. It may be, however, that Fair Trade needs to engage seriously with the idea of an \u201cexit \nstrategy\u201d for producers in a way that Traidcraft (Traidcraft, 2002, p.4), for example, has already \nbegun. This would allow a greater number of producers to benefit from Fair Trade, with the \nestablished Fair Trade organisations acting, in effect, as incubators for fledgling local Fair Trade \norganisations, thereby increasing the effectiveness of Fair Trade in bringing more developing world \nproducers into global markets, equipped with an \u201cefficient technology\u201d (Hayes, forthcoming) to \nenable them to compete. This would not limit the growth in producers\u2019 volumes, while such exit \nstrategies would also help to avoid dependency relationships (in both directions) between Fair \nTrade producer and buyer organisations. \n \nWhat, then, of the impact of this case study of Fair Trade on macromarketing? We will confine \nourselves here to two main points. The first follows from the discussion above and concerns the \nquestion of what kinds of \u201cprograms for action\u201d are envisaged that would bring about the \u201ccultural \nshift\u201d (Dolan, 2002, p.175, cited above) necessary to achieve sustainable consumption. If, as \nsuggested here, Fair Trade cannot make more than limited impact in this direction, the question \narises whether anything can that seeks both to co-operate with and at the same time challenge \norganisations that represent the dominant social paradigm. In particular, then, it raises the question \nwhether the dominant social paradigm can ever be changed from within or whether this requires an \nexternal, and potentially revolutionary rather than evolutionary, approach. While Fair Trade \nprovides a somewhat alternative agenda to and a critique of conventional international trade, it \ncould well be argued that it does so from within the existing paradigm rather than outside of it. \nCertainly it has had some influence, but it could be suggested that this amounts only to dressing the \nemperor in slightly different clothes rather than exposing his ecological nakedness. The question, \nthen, for macromarketers is whether Fair Trade offers a positive example of how they envisage their \nobjective of a change in the dominant social paradigm being achieved, or whether we should look \nelsewhere. \n \nThe second point is in relation to the anthropocentric versus ecocentric world view. It has been \nacknowledged above that Fair Trade privileges the anthropocentric, although it probably does more \ntowards ecological concerns than is generally acknowledged. In that sense, Fair Trade may not be a \nparticularly good example of \u201csustainable communication\u201d or offer an example of a \u201cgreen \ncommodity discourse\u201d that might help to promote less consumption-oriented lifestyles. That said, \nthe challenge that Fair Trade makes to macromarketing is whether it has privileged the ecocentric \nview to an unwarranted degree, and needs to take a more balanced approach. There is some \nevidence that macromarketing is now beginning to address this broader agenda \u2013 Kilbourne\u2019s \n(2004) paper and particularly the work of Sen (1999) on which it draws suggests that this is \nbeginning to occur. We have seen how Fair Trade already grapples at a practical level with many of \nthe substantive freedoms that Sen is concerned with in relation to development \u2013 labour practices \nincluding gender equity, institution-building of both economic and community institutions. This \nwould require macromarketing to acknowledge that there are also serious issues of social justice \nthat need to be grappled with. In other words, a Fair Trade critique of macromarketing suggests that \nit is only just beginning to theorise adequately the importance of social justice issues and the link \n 23\nAccepted for publication in Journal of Strategic Marketing.  \nPlease do not cite without authors\u2019 permission. \n \nbetween social and economic development and ecocentrism. If a change in the dominant social \nparadigm is to be achieved, it will surely need to address these issues more fully, just as much as \nthose of its hitherto ecocentric focus. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThe authors would like to place on record their thanks to those who were interviewed as part of this \nresearch.
