Res., 113, A06308,\ndoi:10.1029\/2007JA012999.\n1. Introduction\n[2] Black aurorae are structures within diffuse aurora with\nlower luminosity [Oguti, 1975; Royrvik, 1976]. They can\neither appear as small patches or black rings that drift,\nmainly eastward, or thin black arcs with or without distinct\nshear motion [Trondsen and Cogger, 1997; Kimball and\nHallinan, 1998a, 1998b]. Their main features can be sum-\nmarized [e.g., Trondsen and Cogger, 1997; Kosch et al.,\n1998b] as follows: Black auroras are mostly east-west\naligned arc segments or patches, with a typical size of\n0.5\u20131.5 \u0001 2.5\u20135 (up to 20) km. They normally occur\npostsubstorm, typically in a diffuse aurora background, and\ndrift eastward postmagnetic midnight with a typical velocity\nof 0.5\u20131.5 (up to 4) km\/s. They may exhibit shear or\nvortices. In many respects, the black aurorae are analogous\nto the negative of normal aurora [Trondsen and Cogger,\n1997]. Hence just like normal aurora, the different mor-\nphologies of the black aurora (e.g., sheared forms showing\nvorticity versus unsheared forms) may be due to different\nmechanisms.\n[3] The classical understanding of black aurora, built on\nFREJA satellite data by Marklund et al. [1997, 1994], is\nthat the reduction in emission is caused by a downward\nelectrical field that drives a downward current. This we will\ndenote \u2018\u2018the retarding potential model\u2019\u2019. At auroral latitudes,\nin the altitude range between 800 and 1700 km, there are\nnarrow structures (down to \u0002 1\u20132 km) with diverging\nelectric fields (up to \u0002 1\u20132 V\/m), dropouts of precipitating\nelectrons, and depletions of thermal plasma. Although no\nsimultaneous optical observations were available to confirm\nthe presence of black auroras, this is associated with black\ncurls and black arcs with sheared flow that have been\nobserved by, for example, Royrvik [1976] and Kimball\nand Hallinan [1998b].\n[4] On the other hand, joint aircraft-based optical and\nFAST satellite observations by Peticolas et al. [2002]\nindicate inhibition of pitch angle scattering of magneto-\nspheric particles into the loss cone as the cause of the black\nstructures. The FAST observations show narrow 50% bite-\nouts in downward electron energy flux above regions with\ndiffuse aurora, where only the flux above 3\u20134 keV inside\nthe downward going loss cone is decreased while the\nelectron fluxes at other pitch angles are identical inside\nand outside the bite-out region. Peticolas et al. [2002]\ndescribe the electron spectra as a \u2018\u2018partial double loss cone\u2019\u2019\nand we will refer to this mechanism as such.\n[5] Combined radar and optical observations of quiet\nblack nonsheared arcs [Blixt and Kosch, 2004] indicate that\nthey are not colocated with any detectable downward\ncurrent. Furthermore, the drift velocity of black patches\nhas no clear relationship to the ionospheric convection\n[Schoute-Vanneck et al., 1990; Blixt et al., 2005b], but\nrather correlates with the energy of the precipitating elec-\ntrons in the surrounding diffuse aurora [Blixt et al., 2005b].\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 113, A06308, doi:10.1029\/2007JA012999, 2008\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Department of Physics and Technology, University of Troms\u00f8,\nTroms\u00f8, Norway.\n2Department of Communication Systems, Lancaster University, Lan-\ncaster, UK.\n3Kiruna Division, Swedish Institute of Space Physics, Kiruna, Sweden.\nCopyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/08\/2007JA012999$09.00\nA06308 1 of 10\nThis is not consistent with a mechanism acting at low\naltitudes following the ionospheric convection. The corre-\nlation between the electron energy and the drift of black\naurora agrees better with a mechanism acting in the equa-\ntorial plane, codrifting with the curvature and gradient drift\nof trapped energetic electrons. However, there are yet no\nsimultaneous optical and satellite observations confirming\nthis.\n[6] It is also worth noting that in diffuse aurora a typical\nsequence of events is the appearance of black patches\n(possibly followed by black rings [Kimball and Hallinan,\n1998a]), that extends to, or is followed by, east-west aligned\nblack arcs [Royrvik, 1976; Trondsen and Cogger, 1997] that\nmight develop shear flow and create black curls, followed\nby the discrete aurora surrounding the black arcs intensify-\ning and becoming \u2018\u2018normal\u2019\u2019 discrete arcs. This sequence\ncan repeat several times.\n[7] In this paper we present simultaneous multimono-\nchromatic and white-light bistatic optical observations as\nwell as incoherent scatter (IS) radar observations of the\ndiffuse and black aurora. The IS observations were made\nwith the European Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) UHF radar,\nlocated near Troms\u00f8 Norway, [Rishbeth and van Eyken,\n1993; Turunen et al., 2002] and gives estimates of electron\nconcentration as well as electron and ion temperatures.\nFrom these we obtain estimates of the energy spectra of\nthe precipitating electrons. The white-light bistatic imaging,\nusing the Digital All-Sky Imager (DASI) [Kosch et al.,\n1998a] located at the EISCAT site and the Odin imager\n[Blixt et al., 2005a] located 27 km away, is used to validate\nthe estimate of the electron spectra by tomographic inver-\nsion methods of the optical data. The multiwavelength\noptical observations were obtained with the Auroral Large\nImaging System (ALIS) [Bra\u00a8ndstro\u00a8m, 2003] station in\nFigure 1. EISCAT UHF IS observations of electron density (top), electron temperature (middle), and\nion temperature (bottom). For the time periods marked with black vertical lines the radar was pointing\ninto magnetic zenith simultaneously with optical observations of black aurora.\nA06308 GUSTAVSSON ET AL.: RADAR AND OPTICAL OBS\n2 of 10\nA06308\nSkibotn which was switching between filters for 4278,\n8446, and 5577 A\u02da between exposures. These observations\nprovide us with quantitative column emission rates in both\nthe diffuse aurora and in the black aurora for two prompt\nemissions, 4278 and 8446 A\u02da, that are only excited by direct\nelectron impact. Since these emissions respond differently\nto the energy of electron precipitation, we use them to test\nthe two theories of black aurora taking the precipitating\nelectron spectrum determined from the EISCAT observa-\ntions as a reference.\n2. Observations\n[8] On 8 October 2005, the DASI TV imager was located\nat the EISCAT radar site (69.59\u0001N, 19.23\u0001E), recording in\nwhite-light with a \u000230\u0001 field of view and pointing into the\nmagnetic zenith (12.8\u0001S). The ODIN TV imager was\nlocated 21.76 km to the south and 16.22 km to the east,\nalso recording in white-light with a 15 \u0001 11\u0001 field of view\nand pointing into the common volume, giving overlapping\nfields-of-view from D-region altitudes and above. The\nEISCAT UHF radar was performing a 7-position scan for\nan unrelated purpose, pointing into the magnetic zenith once\nevery 5 min, measuring electron density and electron and\nion temperature, as shown in Figure 1. The ALIS imager\nin Skibotn (69.35\u0001N, 20.36\u0001E), with a 90\u0001 field-of-view\nobserved in the zenith, with a filter cycle of 4278, 5577,\n4278, 8446 A\u02da with 1.6 s exposure time and 4 s between\nexposures. Black auroras were observed in the interval\n20\u201322 UT.\n[9] Figure 2 (top) shows optical data from DASI of\nunsheared black auroras. The blue dot indicates the EISCAT\nUHF radar pointing direction along the magnetic field\ndirection. Figure 2 (middle row of panels) shows the\ncorresponding electron density profile from EISCAT.\nFigure 2 (bottom) shows the precipitating particle energy\nspectrum, retrieved from the EISCAT data. The inversion\nalgorithm employed was the maximum entropy inversion\ndeveloped by Semeter and Kamalabadi [2005]. Unfortu-\nnately, due to the scanning pattern of the radar, we could not\nmake the correction for temporal variations of the electron\nconcentration. However, for the comparatively slowly vary-\ning diffuse aurora this should not be a major concern.\n[10] The energy spectra of the precipitating electrons was\nestimated from the electron density profiles for the times\nwhen EISCAT observed in magnetic zenith simultaneously\nwith optical observations of the black aurora, marked in\nFigure 1. The estimates of the electron spectra are best\ncharacterized as multipeaked distributions with maxima\naround a few keV, as is shown in Figure 2. Furthermore,\nthe high energy tails are fairly wide, up to several tens of\nkeV.\nFigure 2. Data from the 8 October 2005 campaign taken at Troms, Norway. The top row shows white-\nlight optical data from DASI with a \u000230\u0001 field of view, clearly showing evidence of black auroras. The\nblue dot indicates the EISCAT UHF radar pointing direction along the magnetic field direction. The\nmiddle row shows the electron density profile from EISCAT. The bottom row of panels show\nthe precipitating particle energy spectrum, inferred from inverting the EISCAT data.\nA06308 GUSTAVSSON ET AL.: RADAR AND OPTICAL OBS\n3 of 10\nA06308\n[11] The estimate of the electron spectra from EISCAT\ndata is validated by comparing the bistatic white-light\nimages with calculated images from a modeled three-di-\nmensional distribution of volume emission rates, where the\naltitude variation is proportional to the energy deposition of\nthe electron spectra, and the horizontal variation in column\nemission rate is taken proportional to the DASI images from\nRamfjord projected to the altitude of maximum volume\nemission rate (108 km) as shown in Figure 3, which is\nconsistent with the 115 km Peticolas et al. [2002] calculated\nfrom FAST electron data. This three-dimensional volume\nemission distribution is then used to calculate the spatial\nintensity variation DASI and Odin would observe. Figure 4\nshows the comparison between observed images, shown in\nthe left column, and the modeled images, shown in the right\ncolumn, in arbitrary intensity units. In the top row the fit for\nthe DASI imager located at the EISCAT site is good, which\nis unsurprising since that observed image was used for the\nhorizontal intensity variation. In the bottom row the fit for\nthe Odin imager, located 27 km to the south-east, is also\ngood, which verifies the retrieval of the electron energy\nspectra.\n[12] Simultaneously with the observations in the Ramf-\njord area the same diffuse (and black aurora) was observed\nby the Auroral Large Imaging System (ALIS) [Bra\u00a8ndstro\u00a8m,\n2003] station in Skibotn (69.35\u0001N, 20.36\u0001E, 45 km east\nand 28 km south of the EISCAT site) in 5577, 4278, and\n8446 A\u02da. Figures 5 and 6 shows images in calibrated\nintensity units at selected times, which show regions with\nreduced column emission rates, in both in 4278 A\u02da from\nN2\n+ ,and in 8446 from O(3p3P). For the events we have\nselected here (two shown here and an additional three events\nduring the same time period) the dark structures were close\nto magnetic zenith for a period of time that covered two\nexposures at 4278 A\u02da and one at 8446 A\u02da in-between, thus we\ncan rule out perspective effects and temporal variations as\ncause to smearing of the structures. Near-meridional inten-\nsity cuts show the absolute intensity variation in the diffuse\nbackground aurora, and in the black aurora. The black aurora\ncorresponds to a reduction from 2100\u20132500 Rayleighs to\napproximately 1600\u20131800 R in 4278 A\u02da, while in 8446 A\u02da the\nreduction is from 1700\u20131900 R to 1400\u20131600 R. In both\ncases, the reduction in optical intensity is not even half of the\nintensity of the surrounding diffuse aurora. For the first time,\nwe provide quantitative optical evidence that the black\naurora are not entirely devoid of optical emissions. Their\nvisually black appearance, and hence their name, is an\nartifact of human vision and low contrast night-vision TV\nsystems.\n3. Analysis\n[13] The way the primary spectra of the precipitating\nelectrons in the diffuse aurora is modified to cause the\nblack aurora differs for the two theories. For the retarding-\npotential model, the downward directed electric field will\nreduce the energy of all electrons, and reflect electrons with\nenergies lower than the retarding potential, DE. For the\npartial-double-loss cone model, the flux for energies above\nthe cut-off energy, Ecut, will be reduced. As we have\nestimates of the primary electron spectra for the regions of\ndiffuse aurora, we can calculate the altitude-energy variation\nof electron flux for varying model parameters D E and Ecut\nfor the two theories. Since both the 4278 and 8446 A\u02da\nemissions are prompt and produced by direct electron\nimpact, these electron fluxes will directly give us the\nFigure 3. Cuts through the estimated three-dimensional distribution of diffuse auroral volume emission\nrates at 2023:48 UT, in arbitrary intensity units. In the left a horizontal cut at 108 km of altitude and in the\nright a meridional slice through Ramfjord is shown.\nA06308 GUSTAVSSON ET AL.: RADAR AND OPTICAL OBS\n4 of 10\nA06308\nvariation at 4278 and 8446 A\u02da as a function of the model\nparameters. The production rate for the two optical emis-\nsions responds differently to particle precipitation of differ-\nent energy, partly because the emission cross-sections vary\ndifferently with energy but mainly because of the different\nscale heights of N2 and O, as can be seen in Figure 7. Hence\ncomparing the modeled and observed optical intensities is a\ndirect test for the two theories of the black aurora.\n[14] For the diffuse aurora the precipitating electrons have\nan isotropic pitch angle distribution [e.g., Peticolas et al.,\n2002], thus, we calculate the production rates by solving the\nelectron transport equation for downward, Id, and upward,\nIu, electron fluxes:\n\u0001m\n@Iu\n@s\n\u00bc \u0004 AIu E; s\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe ne s\u00f0 \u00de @\n@E\nL E\u00f0 \u00deIu E; s\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd \t\n\u00fe BId E; s\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe Cu E; s\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe Q E; s\u00f0 \u00de=2 \u00f01\u00de\n\u0004\u0001m @I\nd\n@s\n\u00bc \u0004 AId E; s\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe ne s\u00f0 \u00de @\n@E\nL E\u00f0 \u00deId E; s\u00f0 \u00de\u0001 \u0002\n\u00fe BIu E; s\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe Cd E; s\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe Q E; s\u00f0 \u00de=2 \u00f02\u00de\nHere s is the distance along the magnetic field, which has a\n12.8\u0001 inclination at Troms\u00f8, and \u0001m is the pitch angle cosine\naverage, for which we use 1=\nffiffiffi\n3\np\n[e.g., Stamnes, 1981;\nSolomon et al., 1988].

To model the effect of reduced pitch\nangle scattering for high energy electrons we reduce the flux\nabove a cut-off energy Ecut by 67 percent, which is approx-\nimately the reduction observed by Peticolas et al. [2002].\nThis is illustrated in Figure 8.\n[17] The effect of the retarding potential on the optical\nemissions, shown in Figure 9, is a reduction of 4278 A\u02da by\n20\u201325 percent for a retarding potential DE of \u00021 keV,\nwhich is in good agreement with the FREJA observations\nby Marklund et al. [1997]. However, there is also a\nsignificantly larger relative reduction in the column emis-\nsion rate for 8446 A\u02da, which is reduced by 35% for the same\npotential. This is not consistent with our observations,\nwhich showed a greater reduction for 4278 than 8446 A\u02da.\n[18] For the partial double loss cone model, a cut-off\nenergy of 3\u20134 keV leads to a 20\u201325 percent reduction in\n4278 A\u02da and a 10\u201315 percent reduction in 8446 A\u02da, which is in\ngood agreement with the FAST observations of Peticolas et\nal. [2002]. This is in good agreement with our observations.\n[19] There is a contribution to 8446 A\u02da from cascading of\nO(3s03D) to O(3p3P). Since the optical depth for the 989 A\u02da\nemission from O(3s03D) is large, spatial structures in the\nelectron excitation of in the O(3s03D) will be smeared by\nscattering and absorption of 989 A\u02da photons. According to\nChristensen et al. [1983] the contribution to 8446 A\u02da is\ntypically 27% in night side observations. This will contrib-\nute to a background intensity that is not affected by small-\nscale structures in the electron precipitation. This we have\ntaken into account by adding a fixed background\ncorresponding to 27% of the intensity in the diffuse aurora,\nto the modeled 8446 A\u02da emissions.\n[20] Finally, it should be noted that the altitude variation\nof the column emission rates in the dark structures will be\ndifferent for the two models. Since the retarding potential\nmainly reduces the fluxes at lower energies, emissions at\nhigher altitudes would be reduced more compared to the\npartially double loss cone model where it is the flux of high\nenergy electrons that are reduced\u2014leading to a reduction of\nvolume emission rates at lower altitudes.\n4. Summary and Conclusion\n[21] We have presented the first combined incoherent\nscatter radar, bistatic white-light and monostatic spectral\nimage observations of black aurora. We find that the black\nauroral structures have a reduction by approximately 25% in\n4278 A\u02da and 18% at 8446 A\u02da compared to the intensities in\nthe surrounding diffuse aurora, i.e., black aurora are not\ncompletely devoid of optical emissions. EISCAT measure-\nments of electron density give us estimates of primary\nelectron spectra that we use to model the optical emissions\nat 4278 and 8446 A\u02da. The modeling shows that a retarding\npotential leads to a significantly larger relative reduction in\nthe column emission rate of 8446 A\u02da from atomic oxygen\nthan 4278 A\u02da from N2\n+, which is incompatible with our\nobservations. This shows that a retarding potential at low\naltitudes is not what causes unsheared black aurora. Since\nthe partial double loss cone model [Peticolas et al., 2002]\ngives a better fit to our data, this indicates that unsheared\nblack aurora are magnetopsheric regions of suppressed pitch\nangle scattering that drift with the gradient-B-curvature drift\nof trapped particles Blixt et al. [2005b]. The question is\nthen: what causes the transition to the sheared black aurora\n[e.g., Trondsen and Cogger, 1997; Kimball and Hallinan,\nFigure 9.

To\nanswer this question more combined radar-optical observa-\ntions of diffuse aurora are needed preferably with simulta-\nneous in situ observations of precipitating particles and\nelectric fields.\n[22] Acknowledgments.
