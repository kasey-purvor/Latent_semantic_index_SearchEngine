Smith (2000) reported\nthat male and female faces were asymmetrical in opposite directions, with males having a larger area on\nthe left side compared to the right side, and females having a larger right side compared to the left side.\nThe present study attempted to replicate and extend this finding. Two databases of facial images from\nStirling and St Andrews Universities, consisting of 180 and 122 faces respectively, and a third set of62\nfaces collected at Abertay University, were used to examine Smith's findings. Smith's unique method of\ncalculating the size of each hemiface was applied to each set. For the Stirling and St Andrew's sets a\ncomputer program did this automatically and for the Abertay set it was done manually. No significant\noverall effect of gender on facial area asymmetry was found. However, the St. Andrews sample\ndemonstrated a similar effect to Smith, with females having a significantly larger mean area of right\nhemiface and males having a larger left hemiface. In addition, for the Abertay faces handedness had a\nsignificant effect on facial asymmetry with right handers having a larger left side of the face. These\nfindings give limited support for Smith's results but do also suggest that finding such an asymmetry\nmay depend upon some as yet unidentified factors inherent in some methods of image collection.\nIntroduction\nFacial symmetry is an important aspect of facial attractiveness with more symmetrical faces being\njudged as more attractive (Grammer, & Thornhill, 1994; Perrett et aI., 1999). However, Smith (2000)\npublished a study showing somewhat surprisingly, that males and females have significantly\nasymmetrical faces. Smith (2000) also found that the direction of these asymmetries differed between\nmales and females. He measured a frontal photograph of each participant and measured each side of the\nface (hemiface) in square centimetres. It was found that females were right faced (larger right hemiface)\nwhereas males had a larger left hemiface, with 89% of males showing left-facedness and 73% of\nfemales showing right-facedness.\nSmith interpreted this finding as being caused by the brain's hemispheres having different levels of\ninvolvement, in males and females, in certain types of thinking. For example, studies have suggested\nthat on average females perform better than males on tasks predominantly controlled by the left\nhemisphere, such as verbal tasks (Graves, Goodglass, & Landis, 1982; Hausmann et aI., 1998; Loring,\nMeador, Allison, & Wright, 2000) and males perform better on tasks predominantly controlled by the\nright hemisphere, such as visuo-spatial tasks (e.g. Voyer, 1996).\nAccording to Smith, cognitive tasks that involve one hemisphere more than the other may result in\ngreater muscular activity, and muscle size, on the side of the face controlled by that hemisphere. Smith\nsuggests that because on average females and males rely on verbal and visuospatial thinking to different\nextent this affects the facial musculature of males and females. As a result males tend to have a larger\nleft face, which is under the control of the right hemisphere, and females tend to have a larger right face,\nwhich is controlled by the left hemisphere (Smith, 2000). This was supported through earlier work on\nfacial asymmetry and facial muscle activity (Smith, Smith, & Smith, 1991) suggesting hemiface size\nmay be influenced by muscular activity. Moreover, the direction and extent of facial asymmetry\nappears related to cognitive aptitudes (Smith, 1984) and academic vocations (1998). Thus, Smith (1998)\nfound academics in the humanities, who arguably have highly developed verbal skills, have larger right\nhemifaces whereas academics in math-physics have larger left hemiface areas.\nTo our knowledge Smith's research is the only demonstration that facial asymmetry systematically\ndiffers between males and females. Other studies, using a variety of different techniques to measure\nfacial asymmetry, have failed to find a relationship between gender and facial asymmetry (see Borod,\nHaywood, & Koff, 1997; Borod, Koff, Yecker, Santschi, & Schmidt, 1998 for recent reviews of the\nliterature). For example, Farkas and Cheung (1981), measured facial asymmetry by anthropometry and\nfound no effect of gender. Similarly, Shaner, Peterson, Beattie, and Bamforth (2000) also found no\nrelationship between gender and asymmetry when they measured the asymmetry by\nstereophotogrammetry. Therefore, while there is considerable evidence that faces are asymmetrical,\nfrom studies using measures such as dental occlusion (Namano, Behrend, Harcourt, & Wilson, 2000),\nmusculature (Ferrario, Sforza, Ciusa, Dellavia, & Tartaglia, 2001), and skeletal x-rays (Keles,\nDiyarbakirli, Tan, & Tan, 1997), there is little additional evidence for systematic gender differences in\nfacial asymmetry. Interestingly, however, Keles et al.'s (1997) results revealed differences regarding\nsex, handedness and their interactions. For example, right-handed males were significantly left faced\n(97%), and were more consistent than left-handers who tended to be right faced (68%). In partial\nsupport of Smith (2000) a reanalysis of these results revealed that males had a significantly larger left\nhemiface, while females showed no clear difference (X2 (I, tl=80) = 11.2,12= <0.001). However, it is\nalso clear that the definition of facedness used by Smith (2000) is sQmewhat different from that in other\nstudies and it may be the case that differences in facial asymmetry may only emerge when hemifaces are\nmeasured in the same way as Smith. Therefore, the specific purpose of the present study was to examine\nand extend Smith's (2000) original findings.\nMethod\nThree sets of face images; each gathered under different but self-consistent conditions were used.\nStimuli sets were best possible frontal views, as this was a requirement for the original purposes of each\nset. The Abertay sample was collected specifically to test the findings of Smith (2000) and to add the\nvariable of handedness (as part ofa wider programme of handedness research) and so was carried out in\naccordance with the published methodology of Smith (2000). The other two samples were taken\nspecifically for facial recognition (Stirling) and facial measurement (St. Andrews) studies and so good\nfrontal poses were needed for each set.\nAbertay Facial Images (N=62, 24 male, 38 female)\nAn Olympus Camedia digital camera on a medium resolution setting (images of ]280 x 1024 pixels)\nwas used, and participants (2.5m away) were instructed (with feedback from photographer) to hold their\nhead as straight as possible. The image was viewed immediately after it was taken, and if necessary the\nprocess was repeated. Pictures were downloaded onto a PC and were then suitable for measurement.\nStirling Facial Images (N=180, 110 male, 70 female)\nFaces were collected by the UK Home Office for the purpose of creating a set for use in researching\nissues to do with identification and consisted largely of young adult police cadets together with some\nfrom the army and support staff. The age range was not recorded and they were provided courtesy of\nBob Nicholls, now of PITO. The photos were taken in a consistent way, with a colour chart and\nmeasuring stick present in each image and models arranged to look straight at the camera. The\nphotographs were originally captured on film, at a set distance and using consistent diffuse lighting, and\ntransferred to Photo-CD. Each face was resized to 800x600 pixels and a total of236 points were\nmanually located around major features and the boundary of the face (Frowd, Hancock and Carson,\nsubmitted). Subsequent analysis of the pictures, including a principal component analysis of the face\nshapes, revealed that there were small variations in head pose, but nothing systematic between the sexes.\nAnimations of the principal components of the face shapes may be seen at\nhttp:\/\/www.psychology.stir.ac. uk\/sta ff\/phancock\/pcavary. php.\nSt. Andrews Facial Images (N=122, 69 male, 53 female)\nSitters (average age 21 for both male and female) were photographed under diffuse flash lighting from\ntwo flashguns (one left and one right of the sitter), preventing shadows falling on sitters' faces. Sitters\nremoved glasses and facial jewellery and pushed their hair back fro!!! the forehead. Sitters were asked to\nassume a neutral expression with a closed mouth for the photographs, and keep the their head as level as\npossible. To ensure that sitters were looking neither up nor down into the camera lens, an adjustable\nstool was used in combination with a very narrow mirror (14*1.5cm) mounted above the camera. The\nstool's position was controlled and central to the lens of the camera. Sitters were instructed to look\nthemselves directly in the eye in the mirror. A Fujix OS-300 digital camera was used, and several\nimages of each individual were taken, allowing the selection of the 'best' image in terms of expression\nand head orientation. The images were stored uncompressed at 1000 x 1280 pixel resolution, before\ntransfer to PC for key features to be marked, using a total of 172 points.\nMeasures\nIn order to check our interpretation of Smith's (2000) methods, 20 images (10 male, I0 female) were\nmeasured. All facial images were measured using CANVAS 7, which enabled the experimenter to\ncalculate area, perimeter and other measurements based upon markers placed on the image. For each\nimage, guiding lines and markers were placed onto the image. Initially the distance between the two\npupils was measured, and an interpupillary line was drawn. Next, a line perpendicular to this line was\ndrawn from the exact middle of the first line, carrying down the length of the face, dividing it into 2\nhemifaces. Then a series of 30 to 40 marker points (as per Smith, 2000) were added to the image,\nstarting at the midpoint between the pupils and then following this line towards one side of the face.\nWhen the side was reached, marker points were placed along the contour of the face, until the line\nbisecting the midpoint was reached. The markers were then joined together by placing a final marker at\nthe midpoint of the interpupillary line. This created a polygon within the CANVAS 7 application and\ndefined the hemiface area, which could then be calculated using a function within the application. The\nprocess was repeated for the other hemiface. Two experimenters (SH + PR) independently measured the\nimages and achieved a significant correlation between their measures (Pearson Correlation, [(20) = 0.93,\n)2<0.0]). This was taken as evidence that the procedures defined by Smith (2000) allow a reliable and\naccurate measurement of hem iface area.\nAutomated Measurement Program\nA program was written in Matlab to analyse the face shape files. It was written to draw the equivalent\nlines and measure the equivalent areas as the CANVAS 7 measurements (as per Smith, 2000 and\ndescribed above) and to give near identical measures. The rationale for doing this was due to the outline\nof the face being already marked by points in both the Stir!ing and St. Andrews samples, thus allowing\nan effective basis for making similar calculations to the CANVAS 7 version. This was confirmed by\nindependently measuring 36 images on the Matlab programme and CANVAS 7 and it was found that\nthe results from the two methods were highly significantly correlated (Pearson Correlation, [ (36) =\n0.94,12<0.001). Therefore, the two methods gave similar facedness results.\nResults\nThe entire database of faces was amalgamated for the overall analysis, however each separate set was\nalso compared with each other and sex differences were compared within each set. Finally, the Abertay\nsample had data on handedness and this was included as a factor for this set. Faces were compared on\nmeasures similar to those used by Smith (2000) and so both parametric and non-parametric analyses\nwere done. However, one additional difference was that the hemifaces were compared with each other in\nterms of their relative size differences. This was expressed as of R-L area difference; meaning that a\npositive area indicated a larger right hemiface, while a negative area indicated a larger left hemiface.\nTable I: Mean area In square plxe s or t e ngtt an e eml ace measures.\nMean Std.

A comparison of these means showed no overall difference between the areas of the two sides of the\nface (1(363) = 1.115,12=0.265\u00bb. In order to examine potential sex differences, a 2x3 between subjects\nANOVA was conducted, with sex and dataset as factors and R-L differences as the dependent variable\n(Table 2). There was no main effect of sex on facedness (F(I,358)= 0.819, 12=0.366)and no effect of\ndataset (F(2,358)= 0.774, 12=0.462),but there was a significant dataset by sex interaction (F(2.358)= 3.786,\n12=0.024). Individual analyses of the datasets showed no significant difference between the sexes for the\nAbertay sample (F(I.6o)= 2.236, 12=0.140)or the Stirling sample (F(I.178)= 0.003,12=0.960). The St.\nAndrews sample showed a significant sex difference (F(I.12o)= 4.859, 12=0.029),with females showing a\nlarger mean area of right hemiface and males having a larger mean left hemiface.\na e ean area In square plxe s or t e ngl tan e emt ace measures, separate )y ataset\nMean Std.

Initially, the number of\nright faced vs. left faced individuals was compared (regardless of sex) and given the almost identical\nnumbers it is unsurprising this was not significant (X2 (1, .!\"!.=364)= 0.0 1,12=0.917). In addition, males\nexamined separately did not have a significant asymmetry in face size (X2 (1, .!\"!.=203)= 0.044, 12=\n0.833), nor did females (X2 (1, .!\"!.=161)= 0.006, 12=0.937).\nTable 3: Categorical data for all three samples and for the combineddataset.

Individual two-way Chi-square analyses showed that\nfacedness x sex was non-significant X2 (1, .!\"!.=364)= 0.01, 12=0.923), but facedness x data set\napproached significance (X2 (2, .!\"!.=364)= 5.25,12= 0.073). However, analysis carried out on differences\nfor males only (X2 (2,.!\"!.=203) = 2.70, 12=0.258) and females only <:>e (2, .!\"!.=161)= 3.71, 12=0.156)\nfailed to reach significance. Comparing sex x dataset there was a significant effect, (X2 (2, .!\"!.=364) =\n9.38,12= 0.009), suggesting that the 3-way interaction was related to differences between datasets rather\nthan sex-specific facedness. Looking within each of the individual sets of data, none showed a\nsignificant difference in the pattern of larger hemifaces, although not all data sets showed the same\ndirection of difference (Table 3). When individual patterns within conditions were examined, there\nwere some directional differences between them (e.g. UAD both sexes left faced, Stirling both right\nfaced). Only the St. Andrews dataset showed a pattern of results similar to those found by Smith (2000)\nalthough this effect of sex on facedness was non-significant when analysed using categorical data.\nAs handedness was previously found to influence facedness (Keles, et a!., 1997), then this variable was\ninvestigated for the single set of data that had such information (Table 4). A 2x2 between subjects\nANaYA was conducted, with sex and handedness as factors and R-L differences as the dependent\nvariable. There was no main effect of sex on facedness (F(I,58)= 2.743, 12=0.103), no effect of\nhandedness (F(I,58)= 0.137, 12=0.713), and no sex by handedness interaction (F(I,s8)= 1.633,12=0.206).\nHowever, if the samples are compared as categorical data, in terms of facedness (as per Smith, 2000), a\ndifferent pattern emerges (Table 4). It is clear that there was an overall effect of handedness on the\ndegree of facedness (X2 (I, .!\"!.=62)= 8.22, 12=0.008) with right-handed individuals being significantly\nleft faced (X2 (I, .!\"!.=27)= 10.7,12=0.001), while left-handers showed no lateral effects (X2 (I, .!\"!.=35)=\n0.257,12=0.612).\nLeft Right Total\nFaced Faced\nRight Handed 22 (81.5%) 5 (18.5%) 27 X2= 10.7,df= l,p=O.OI\nLeft Handed 16 (45.7%) 19 (54.3%) 35 X\" = 0.257, df= I, P = 0.612\nTotal 38 24 62 XL = 8.22, df=l, p= 0.008\nDiscussion\nThis study investigated the extent to which it is possible to generalize the gender difference in facial\nasymmetry reported by Smith (2000). While the pooled results did not support the findings of Smith\nfindings, rather intriguingly, the St Andrews database (N= 122) offered some support for the effect. In\nline with what Smith found, female faces were significantly more right faced and male faces were\nsignificantly more left faced. However, in contrast to Smith's results, the magnitude of the difference\nwas very small. Indeed, following the procedures outlined by Coe (2000), an analysis of this data\nindicated an effect size of 004. Drawing on the conventions set by Cohen (1988) this can be interpreted\nas a weak to medium effect. The finding derived from the Abertay database (N=62), although not\nsignificant, was of a similar magnitude (effect size = 0.39), though interestingly, in the opposite\ndirection to the findings derived from the St Andrews database. With the Abertay set, the males tended\nto be slightly more right faced and the females more left faced. The largest of the three databases,\nStirling (N=I 80), provided no evidence at all for a gender difference in facial asymmetry with the male\nand female faces providing almost identical measurements (effect size = 0.01). Based on these varying\nresults and the fact that the much larger pooled database (N=352) provided little evidence for a gender-\nbased effect (effect size = 0.12) we conclude that it is surprisingly difficult to replicate the effect shown\nby Smith (2000). This failure to find a reliable effect concurs with most previous studies (e.g. Ferrario\net aI., 200 I) that indicated a lack of systematic facial asymmetry and is further supported by several\nfindings on asymmetry, which are inconsistent between studies and often contradictory in nature (e.g.\nBruyer & Craps, 1985; Burke, 1992; Keles et aI., 1997).\nThe elusive nature of this effect may be explained by the fact that the three independent research groups\nhad broadly similar but crucially non-identical procedures for capturing their images. One the other\nhand, it can be argued that consistent with Smith (2000), each had a controlled process that was known\nto provide consistent results. Equally true, it is also clear that unlike previous studies (e.g. Keles et aI.,\n1997) facedness was measured according to the particular definition\u00b7 and methods used by Smith (2000),\nand importantly, was the same for all three of the databases. So it is not at all clear why the effect was\nnot found in all three of the datasets.\nIn conclusion, it is possible that some currently unknown part of the photography process may subtly\ninfluence the orientation of heads (e.g. gender of poser \/photographer (Schirillo, 2000) or even\nhandedness, this study) but at this point in time we do not know the exact nature of such an influence\nand cannot say why the gender effect is sometimes found and sometimes not.\nBorod, J.c.,Haywood, C.S, & Koff, E.
