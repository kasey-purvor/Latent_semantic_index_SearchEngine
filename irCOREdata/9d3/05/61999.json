The instrument yielded 750 CTD profiles, 250 of them \nto the sea floor.  The data show a full depth flow of water onto the shelf via a sill at \nthe shelf break (74\u00b0S 44\u00b0W).  The warmth from the core of the flow was able to \nmaintain the surface mixed layer above the freezing point, resulting in a band of \nreduced ice-production.  An estimate of the on-shelf flux suggests that this flow \naccounts for most of the estimated 3 Sv of water draining from the southern Weddell \nSea continental shelf. \nIntroduction \nThe central region of the southern Weddell Sea continental shelf is an important area \nfor the production of High Salinity Shelf Water (HSSW), the key precursor for \nAntarctic Bottom Water originating in the Weddell Sea.  Over the last few decades \nmost research in the region has been concerned with the pathways of dense water \nleaving the continental shelf to form Weddell Sea Bottom Water (WSBW).  \nMeasurements of the drainage from the continental shelf of waters rich in glacial melt \n[Foldvik et al., 2004], combined with tracer measurements by Weppernig et al. \n[1996], suggest a production rate of HSSW required to supply the newly formed \nWSBW of around 3 Sv [Nicholls et al., in press]. \nAs part of an investigation into the processes concerned with the production of \nHSSW, the aim of the present study is to help determine the mechanisms that control \nthe flow on to the continental shelf of the original source waters for the HSSW, and to \ncharacterize their flow and properties.  Modified Warm Deep Water (MWDW) is a \nrelatively warm off-shelf water mass in contact with the continental slope of the \nsouthern Weddell Sea.  MWDW is known to flow across the shelf-break sill formed \nwhere the Filchner Depression intersects the shelf edge (Figure 1).  This core of \nMWDW is thought to penetrate intermittently as far south as Filchner Ice Front \n[Foldvik et al., 1985], but summertime current meter measurements suggest that it \nmight not be the dominant source of water for the continental shelf as a whole \n[Nicholls et al., in press]. \nSummertime hydrographic sections obtained along Ronne Ice Front find a second \nperennial core of MWDW at a longitude of 53\u00b0 West [Rohardt, 1984; Foldvik et al., \n1985; Gammelsr\u00f8d et al., 1994; Nicholls et al., 2003].  Foldvik et al. [2001] describe \nyear-round data from instruments moored at this ice-front location that show this \nsecond core to be a quasi-permanent feature, only losing its identity between \nSeptember and December.  Vaughan et al. [1995] hypothesize that this MWDW core \ntracks along the western flank of Berkner Bank from a second shelf break sill, at \nabout 74\u00b0S 44\u00b0 W (Figure 1). \nDespite its importance in the production of HSSW, the central area of the southern \nWeddell Sea continental shelf has very few summertime observations, and none from \nwinter.  The reason for the lack of data is the year-round heavy sea ice.  Any moorings \ndeployed in the central area of the shelf during summer in an attempt to get winter \nobservations would be highly vulnerable to dredging by icebergs.   In an attempt to \nacquire wintertime data from along the hypothesized path of the MWDW inflow, four \nWeddell seals were equipped with tags that consisted of miniature CTD instruments \nand Argos transmitters.  This paper describes the data from one of the seals, which \n 3\ntraveled over the central region of the continental shelf north of Ronne Ice Shelf.  We \ndiscuss the evidence the dataset provides about the wintertime structure, flux, salinity \nand temperature of the inflow of MWDW. \nMethod \nThe species of seal selected for the study had to meet several criteria:  it must forage \nover the southern continental shelf, that is, not migrate north with the pack ice edge; it \nmust dive deep enough to yield sufficient full depth profiles; and it should be present \nin large enough numbers in the area of the cruise to improve the chance of finding \nsuitable animals for tagging.  Based on the limited information available on the \nbehavior of seals in the Weddell Sea, we chose the Weddell Seal (Leptonychotes-\nWeddellii).  Weddell seals have the southernmost range of all seal species, remaining \ndeep within the ice throughout the year.  Weddell seals are also extremely \naccomplished divers [Kooyman et al., 1966], and adult Weddell Seal foraging dives \nover the eastern Weddell Sea continental shelf have been shown to extend to 450 m \n[Pl\u00f6tz et al., 2001].  In addition, helicopter seal surveys conducted by the Alfred \nWegener Institute had observed Weddell Seals in the vicinity of the cruise area.  \nThe tags used in this study were Satellite Relay Data Loggers (SRDLs) designed and \nmanufactured by the Sea Mammal Research Unit (SMRU) at the University of St. \nAndrews.  The CTD modules in the tags were manufactured by Valeport Ltd, Devon, \nU.K.  Here we briefly describe the tags; a full description is given by Biuw et al. \n[2007].  The CTD head uses a platinum resistance temperature sensor, an inductive \nconductivity sensor and a strain gauge-type pressure sensor.  A wet-dry sensor \ndetermines when the animal is in the water, and the pressure sensor determines when \na dive is in progress.  The aim is to obtain one deep profile per six-hour time window, \nwhile minimizing the number of dives for which the sensors are activated, thus \nmaximizing battery life.  Whether the tag uses the dive to obtain a profile depends on \nthe maximum depth of the dive compared with the maximum depth of previous dives \nwithin the six-hour window, and how close the time window is to expiring.  If the \ndive is to be used for a profile, the C, T and pressure sensors are read once per second \nas the seal ascends.  In this application the profiles were sub-selected at 20 points at \nuniform pressure intervals, the salinity profile calculated, and then the T and S \nprofiles communicated using an Argos transmitter.  Data compression techniques used \nin the tag are discussed by Fedak et al. [2002].  The Argos system also stamps the \nmessages with the transmitter position, estimated to have an accuracy of about 2 km. \nThe tags give the transmission of temperature profiles into the Argos system a higher \npriority than salinity profiles, as the conductivity sensors were thought to be more \nprone to failure.  In the event, both sensors worked well, and the reliability of the \ntransmissions resulted in there being around nine salinity profiles for every ten \ntemperature profiles successfully received from the tags.   \nThe CTD heads were initially calibrated at the manufacturer\u2019s facility before being \nintegrated into the tags at SMRU.  The completed tags were re-calibrated at Valeport \nbefore being shipped.  Prior to the deployment, the tags were mounted on the ship\u2019s \nCTD frame for a final check of the calibrations, and particularly to determine any \npressure effects on the sensors.  After final checks against the ship-based SeaBird \nElectronics CTD system, we estimate the absolute uncertainty in the tag-derived \nsalinity and temperature data to be 0.02 and 0.005\u00b0C respectively. \nThe Weddell seals were located in nine to ten tenths, rotten, largely un-ridged, first \nyear ice.  For each deployment, the ship maneuvered alongside the seal\u2019s floe, \n 4\ntypically four personnel approached the animal, placed a \u201chead bag\u201d over its head and \nlightly sedated it using an intravenous injection of a 1:1 mixture of Tiletamine and \nZolasepam [Zoletil\u00ae 100 (Virbac)] at an approximate dose of 0.2\u20130.4 mg kg-1, based \non the seal\u2019s estimated weight.  The tags were glued to the fur on the head or upper \nneck region using two-component industrial epoxy glue according to the methods \ndescribed in Fedak et al. [1983], and McConnell et al. [2002]. \nResults \nFour tags were deployed.  One stopped transmitting after about two weeks, possibly \nbecause of a failure in the tag, but more likely a result of predation.  Of the three other \nseals tagged, one spent the winter months foraging over the continental shelf near \nBrunt Ice Shelf (Figure 1), another ranged over the narrow continental slope to the \neast, and the final animal remained over the southwestern continental shelf.  It is the \ndataset from the last animal that is the subject of this paper.  The seal spent much of \nthe winter over the western slope of Berkner Bank and the topographic depression to \nthe west, ideal behavior for the purposes of this study.  The track is shown in Figure 1, \nwhich also highlights the region of interest.  The animal entered the shelf area 25 May \n2007, and the final oceanographically useful transmissions were made 26 September \n2007, yielding a four-month dataset throughout the winter months. \nThe distribution of relative depths (the depth as a fraction of the estimated seabed \ndepth at the dive location) of the 750 profiles obtained from within the study area is \nshown in Figure 2.  The bathymetry in the area is poorly known; if we assume that \nrelative dive depths of greater than ~0.9 are dives to the seafloor, then the total \nnumber of full-depth dives is ~250.  Even without the assumption that the seal dives \nto the sea floor, any location where the seal\u2019s maximum dive depth is greater than the \npresent estimate of the sea floor depth improves our knowledge of the bathymetry. \nAlthough the profiles were obtained over a period of several months, we will assume \nthat the hydrographic conditions in the study area were steady in order to construct a \nquasi-synoptic view.  Such an assumption is reasonable if the on-shelf flow is strong, \nand the off-shelf properties have no significant seasonal variation.  The similarity \nbetween CTD profiles obtained when the seal revisited an area of the sill in early \nSeptember that it had originally visited in mid-June lends support to the second \nrequirement.  The absence of spatial noise in the sections is additional evidence for \nrelatively stationary property fields.  However, possible temporal evolution of the \nhydrographic structure of the region needs to be borne in mind. \nFigure 1 shows the two boxes that we use to create the temperature and salinity \nsections shown in Figure 3.  The approximate bedrock depth shown in the sections is \nfrom the Bedmap bathymetry [Lythe et al., 2001] along the axis of the box. \nThe sections shown in Figure 3 indicate a substantial incursion of water from the \nshelfbreak, across the continental shelf, towards the ice front.  The intruding water is \nsignificantly fresher in the upper layers than that to the east and west, with an \nincreasing salinity towards the south. There is a core of MWDW at a depth of \nbetween 200 m and 350 m.  Figure 4 shows the surface salinity as measured by the tag \nin the study area.  The shallowest salinity value from each profile was used in this \nfigure, which was always from a pressure of 8 dbar.  Again, the entire dataset was \nregarded as synoptic.  The map shows the horizontal extent of the low salinity inflow \nof off-shelf waters on to the continental shelf north of Ronne Ice Shelf. \n 5\nDiscussion \nThe isohalines in the vicinity of the southwestern Weddell Sea continental shelf break \nhave been described as having a \u201cV\u201d shape, with high salinity to the south, over the \ncontinental shelf, and a \u201criver\u201d of low salinity water above the \u201cV\u201d flowing along the \ncontinental slope [Gill, 1973].  Figure 4 can be interpreted as showing isohalines \noutcropping at the southern side of the \u201cV\u201d, the outcropping deviating far to the south \nleaving a tongue of fresher water over the continental shelf.  Figure 3 shows this to \ntake the form of a flow of off-shelf waters into the shelf region, and indicates that the \nincursion is a full-depth southward flow along the western flank of Berkner Bank.  \nThis represents a split in the westward continental slope front current at 44\u00b0W. Gill \n[1973] describes a similar split at 27\u00b0W where a tongue of MWDW turns to the south \nto traverse the eastern flank of Filchner Depression. \nExamination of the 8-dbar temperatures shows that the temperature of the water in the \nmixed layer on the eastern side of the axis of the inflow is around 0.03\u00b0C above the \nsurface freezing point (not visible in Figure 3), unlike the mixed layer temperatures \nmeasured to the west, which are not significantly different from the freezing point.  \nThe vertical heat flux from the warm core of MWDW must therefore cause a local \nreduction in the ice production rate.  As the mean ice drift is across the line of the \ninflow, rather than along it, the reduction in the production rate is not visible in, for \nexample, the ice concentration fields. \nThe fact that the inflow is in some sense strong is shown by the limited modification \nthat the water column has undergone between the two sections in Figure 3, in an area \nwhere we expect strong wintertime atmospheric cooling, albeit through pack ice.  The \nmost notable change in the water column is the 0.05 increase in salinity of the upper \n250 m of the central core of the inflow.  If we assume a heat flux to the atmosphere of \naround 50 W m-2 [Eisen and Kottmeier, 2000], and that the central core is near the \nfreezing point, the ice formation required to effect the necessary salinity increase \nwould take around 17 days.  Given a distance between the sections of about 180 km, \nthe speed of flow must be on the order of 7 cm s-1.  The cross-sectional area of the \ncentral core (using the northern section, which is transverse to the flow) then gives a \nflux of about 1.6 Sv.  If the remainder of the core has an average speed of half that of \nthe central core, then the estimate of the total flow becomes at least 2.6 Sv, \napproaching the 3-Sv estimate of the total drainage of HSSW from the shelf.  The \nneglect of lateral diffusion of salinity into the core means that our simple calculation \nis likely to underestimate the true flux, although the heat flux to the atmosphere is also \npoorly known. \nInspection of the isohalines from ice front sections [Rohardt, 1984; Foldvik et al., \n1985; Gammelsr\u00f8d et al., 1994] reveals the remnant of the lower salinity water at the \ndepth of, and above, the MWDW core.  Indeed, the ice front sections show a large-\nscale low salinity feature centered on the location of the core.  At the ice front, \nFoldvik et al. [2001] found the direction of flow at the depth of the MWDW core to \nbe northwestward along the ice front, with a speed of around 8 cm s-1.  A short section \nperpendicular to the ice front at 51\u00b0 West was occupied in early 1980 [Foldvik et al., \n1985], which indicated the summertime extent of the ice front MWDW.  If the current \nmeter data were representative of the flow, then the flux northwestward along the ice \nfront would be around 0.8 Sv.  We have no evidence that the core does not split at the \nice front, with a component heading southwestwards towards Berkner Island. \n 6\nConclusions \nWe have presented data from a CTD carried by a Weddell Seal that spent the austral \nwinter of 2007 foraging over the southern Weddell Sea continental shelf.  The region \nsurveyed by the seal included a topographic depression that guides relatively warm \noff-shelf water onto the continental shelf.  Of the 750 profiles obtained from this area \naround 250 extend to the sea floor, contributing to our knowledge of both the \nbathymetry and hydrography of an otherwise sparsely sampled region.  The data show \nan apparently strong, full depth inflow entering the shelf regime along the eastern \nflank of the depression that, at the shelf break, is centered at around 44\u00b0W.   \nWe find that the surface mixed layer in the inflow remains above the surface freezing \npoint as a result of vertical heat flux from the warm core of MWDW, causing a local \nreduction in the sea ice production rate. \nSimple calculations based on the data suggest that a lower bound for the volume flux \nof the flow is around 2.6 Sv.  This inflow could therefore account for the majority of \nthe 3 Sv of total on-shelf transport required to balance the off-shelf flow.  Historical \nsummertime datasets collected by conventional oceanographic techniques indicate a \ncomponent of this MWDW flow northwestward along the ice front with a flux of \naround 0.8 Sv. \nThe danger to instrument moorings from iceberg damage, and the difficult sea ice \nconditions has meant that wintertime oceanographic processes over the central \nsouthern Weddell Sea continental shelf have never before been studied.  Tagged seals \noffer the physical oceanographer a view of a region that is virtually inaccessible in \nany other way. \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors are grateful for the support of the officers and crew of RRS Ernest \nShackleton, and to Adrian Jenkins, Ole Anders N\u00f8st and an anonymous reviewer for \ntheir helpful comments on the manuscript. \n 7\nReferences \nBiuw, M., L.
