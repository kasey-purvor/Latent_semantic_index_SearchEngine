INTRODUCTION\nThe coupling of an open quantum system to an ex-\nternal reservoir induces a dynamical loss of phase coher-\nence that results in an irreversible destruction of inter-\nference effects between states of the system [1, 2]. This\nenvironment-induced decoherence efficiently suppresses\nmacroscopic superpositions of states and therefore plays\na central role in our understanding of the transition from\nquantum to classical physics. An important and often\nannoying feature of decoherence for quantum-mechanical\napplications is that it typically occurs very rapidly with\nan exponential decoherence factor, D(t) = exp(\u2212t\/tc),\nwhere tc is the short coherence time [1, 2]. In some cases,\nhowever, the coherence time can be controlled by prop-\nerly engineering the reservoir and\/or the interaction be-\ntween the system and the reservoir [3]. The feasibility of\nsuch schemes has been experimentally demonstrated in a\nvariety of systems that include cavity QED [4], ion traps\n[5] and cold atom experiments [6\u20138]. Besides their ob-\nvious technological implications, these experiments pro-\nvide essential tests of the general concept of environment-\ninduced decoherence.\nThe atom-optical experiments [6\u20138] are designed to re-\nalize the quantum-kicked rotator [9\u201311], a paradigm of\ncomplex chaotic dynamics which can be simply seen as\na particle moving on a ring and periodically kicked in\ntime. For sufficiently strong kicking strength, the classi-\ncal motion of a kicked rotator is chaotic and the evo-\nlution in momentum space is diffusive. In the quan-\ntum regime, however, momentum diffusion is asymptot-\nically suppressed due to dynamical localization [12, 13].\nIn the recent atom-optical reservoir-engineering experi-\nments, the loss of coherence has been induced by am-\nplitude noise [7] and timing noise [8]. In the first case,\nthe amplitude of the periodic kicks is randomly modu-\nlated in a controlled manner, whereas in the second case\nthe period between successive kicks is randomly varied.\nIn both situations, dynamical localization is extenuated\nleading to a non-vanishing quantum momentum diffu-\nsion with a renormalized diffusion coefficient, in agree-\nment with theoretical predictions [7, 14, 15]. These ex-\nperiments enjoy a high degree of control and tunability,\nwhich makes the atom-optical setup ideally suited to in-\nvestigate the decoherence-induced quantum-to-classical\ncrossover of complex quantum systems [16].\nOne point is especially noteworthy: reservoir engineer-\ning has so far been used to tune the coherence time, but\nnot the exponential time dependence of the decoherence\nfactor D(t) itself. Our aim in this paper is to describe a\nreservoir coupling scheme for the cold atom experiments\nwhich allows to modify the time dependence of D(t) and\nslow down the loss of phase coherence in a controlled way.\nTo this end, we superpose the regular periodic pulses with\nnoise events occurring with randomly modulated time in-\ntervals \u03c4 (i. e., we combine amplitude with timing noise).\nWe generate these random time intervals by a renewal\nprocess with a waiting-time distribution w(\u03c4). Of spe-\ncial interest is the case where this distribution asymptot-\nically behaves as a power law, w(\u03c4) \u221d \u03c4\u22121\u2212\u03b1. By tuning\nthe exponent \u03b1 of this so-called Le\u00b4vy noise [17], we are\nable to change the mean waiting time between successive\nnoise events, given by \u03c4 =\n\u222b\u221e\n0\nd\u03c4 \u03c4 w(\u03c4), and therefore\ncan smoothly interpolate between a fully coupled situa-\ntion where most kicks are perturbed by the noise (large\n\u03b1) to an almost isolated situation where most kicks are\nnot perturbed by the noise (small \u03b1). Divergent moments\nare a hallmark of Le\u00b4vy statistics and the mean waiting\ntime \u03c4 becomes infinite when \u03b1 \u2264 1. In this case the noise\nis nonstationary and nonergodic [18, 19]. We show that\nthis type of noise modifies the decoherence of the atoms\nin a striking manner: The exponential time dependence\n2of the decoherence factor D(t) is replaced by a Mittag-\nLeffler function [20], which starts out as a stretched ex-\nponential and asymptotically decays as a power-law. For\nthis functional form, the coherence time is ill-defined.\nIn Ref. [21] we briefly discussed one manifestation of\nthe modified decoherence pattern, namely a subdiffusive\nmomentum spreading of the atoms. In this work, we\npresent a theory that links the subdiffusive behavior to\nthe nonstationarity of the noise. This requires us to ex-\ntend the previous theories of Refs. [14, 15] beyond the\nperturbative short-time regime and to account for the\nadditional timing noise from the renewal process. We\nalso discuss the limiting distribution function and the\ninverse participation ratio, which provide additional in-\nformation about the dynamics in momentum space. As\nalternative measures of coherence, we then consider the\npurity and the fidelity [22\u201324] of atoms subjected to dif-\nferent realizations of the noise, which can be probed in\nan echo experiment, such as carried out, e.g., for micro-\ncavities in Ref. [25] (for atom-optical proposals of such\nexperiments see Refs. [26\u201328]). For nonexponential de-\ncoherence, we find that the purity initially decays with a\nstretched exponential, which is followed by two regimes\nof power-law decay with different exponents. The decay\nof the averaged logarithm of the fidelity is related to the\nsprinkling distribution of the renewal process. Through-\nout the paper our findings are illustrated by comparison\nto the results from a numerical implementation of the\nkicked rotator.\nThe structure of this paper is as follows. Section II de-\nscribes the quantum kicked rotator and the environmen-\ntal coupling scheme of combined amplitude and timing\nnoise generated by a renewal process. In Sec. III we de-\nrive the nonperturbative expression for the decoherence\nfactor and evaluate it for Le\u00b4vy noise. In the case of non-\nstationary noise with \u03b1 \u2264 1, the decoherence function is\nnonexponential. Section IV discusses how the modified\ndecoherence affects the momentum spreading, while Sec.\nV contains the discussion of the purity and fidelity. The\nresults of this paper are summarized in Sec. VI.\nII. THE LE\u00b4VY KICKED ROTATOR\nA. Model\nThe motion of atoms exposed to pulsed standing-wave\npotentials can be mapped onto a quantum kicked rotator\n[9\u201311], i.e., a point particle moving on a ring and sub-\njected to periodical kicks. In suitable units, the Hamil-\ntonian of the kicked rotator takes the form\nH =\np2\n2\n+\n\u221e\u2211\nn=\u2212\u221e\nKn cos \u03b8 \u03b4(t\u2212 n+ 0+), (1)\nwhere the kicking potential depends on the 2pi-periodic\nrotation angle \u03b8 and the kicking amplitude Kn can in\ngeneral be kick dependent.\nFrom kick to kick, the stroboscopic classical dynamics\nof the kicked rotator is generated by the map\np(t+ 1) = p(t) +Kt sin \u03b8, (2)\n\u03b8(t+ 1) = \u03b8(t) + p(t+ 1). (3)\nStarting from a given initial state \u03c8(0), the corresponding\nquantum dynamics \u03c8(t+1) = F (Kt)\u03c8(t) is generated by\nthe Floquet operator\nF (Kt) = exp(\u2212ih\u00af\u22121p\u02c62\/2) exp(\u2212ih\u00af\u22121Kt cos \u03b8\u02c6). (4)\nIn both cases, the dynamics consists of a kick in which\nthe momentum changes by Kt sin \u03b8, followed by a free\nrotation in which the rotation angle \u03b8 increases by p.\nIn the absence of noise, the dynamics of the kicked\nrotator is entirely controlled by the constant parameter\nKn = K. For K >\u223c 5, the classical dynamics is chaotic\nand the growth of the momentum is on average diffusive\nwith a variance var p(t) ' Dclt. The classical diffusion\nconstant is given by Dcl ' K2\/2 [29]. By contrast, in\nthe quantum regime, the kicked rotator exhibits dynami-\ncal localization, an interference phenomenon akin to An-\nderson localization in disordered solids, which manifests\nitself in an exponentially decaying envelope of the qua-\nsienergy eigenstates F (k) of the Floquet operator [12].\nAs a result, momentum diffusion is suppressed and the\nvariance\nvar p0(t) ' D\u2217t\u2217[1\u2212 exp(\u2212t\/t\u2217)] (5)\nsaturates after the quantum break time t\u2217 ' D\u2217\/h\u00af2 [13].\nThe constant D\u2217 is of order of the classical diffusion con-\nstant Dcl, but is subject to quantum corrections [30].\nThe transition between the quantum and the classical\nbehavior of the rotator can be induced by subjecting the\nkicked particle to additional random kicks, simulating in\nsuch way the coupling to an external environment, where\nthe characteristics of the imposed noise is controlled ex-\nternally. In the case of amplitude noise [7], the kicking\namplitude is explicitly n-dependent, Kn = K+kn, where\nthe perturbations kn are random numbers. In the pres-\nence of conventional timing noise [8] the period between\nthe kicks (here set to unity) is slightly modulated.\nIn this paper we consider an unconventional combina-\ntion of amplitude and timing noise: kicks always appear\nat periodic instances and the amplitude of some of the\nkicks are perturbed. However, the (integer-valued) time\nintervals between the noise events are generated by a re-\nnewal process with waiting-time distribution \u03c9(\u03c4) (see\nFig. 1 for a schematic illustration). The timing of the\nN \u2019th noise event (N = 1, 2, 3, . . .) is hence given by\ntN =\nN\u2211\nn=1\n\u03c4n, (6)\nwhere each waiting time \u03c4n is drawn independently from\nthe same probability distribution \u03c9(\u03c4). The strength of\nthe individual noise events will be characterized by the\n3t\u03c41 \u03c46\u03c45\u03c44\u03c43\u03c42 \u03c47 \u03c410\u03c49\u03c48\nK\nt\n\u03baK\n(a)\n\u25ca\n 1e-009\n 1e-006\n 0.001\n 1\n 1  10  100  1000\nw\n(\u03c4\n)\n\u03c4\n 0\n 1\n 0  5\n \n \n(b)\n\u03b1=0.5\n\u03b1=1.0\n\u03b1=1.5\n\u03b1=2.0\nFIG. 1: (color online). (a) Schematic illustration of the kick-\ning sequence in the Le\u00b4vy kicked rotator. The period of the\nkicks is set to unity. The timing of the noise is generated\nin a renewal process, which selects the integer-valued waiting\ntimes \u03c4n from a distribution \u03c9(\u03c4). (b) Waiting-time distrib-\nutions of the Yule-Simon form (24) for different values of the\nparameter \u03b1. The distributions display power-law tails, spec-\nified in Eq. (25), and hence generate Le\u00b4vy noise of variable\nexponent. The lines are a guide to the eye.\nvariance k2tN = \u03ba of the perturbed kicks, whereas on\naverage ktN = 0.\nThe usual white amplitude noise is obtained for a\nwaiting-time distribution \u03c9(\u03c4) = \u03b4\u03c4,1, so that every kick\nis perturbed. A more intriguing case is a waiting-time\ndistribution which asymptotically behaves as a power law\n(Le\u00b4vy noise),\nw(\u03c4) \u223c c \u03c4\u22121\u2212\u03b1, (7)\nwhere c is a constant. For \u03b1 < 1 the mean waiting time\n\u03c4 diverges. Unlike the familiar white amplitude noise,\nLe\u00b4vy noise [31] generates a nonstationary process with\nunconventional statistical features that are reviewed in\nthe following subsection.\nB. Statistical properties of Le\u00b4vy noise\nThe properties of noise generated by a renewal process\ncan be conveniently quantified by analyzing the num-\nber of noise events N (t\u2032, t\u2032\u2032) within an interval [t\u2032\u2032, t\u2032).\nThe number N (t, 0) is obtained by inverting the ran-\ndom time tN , and hence is known as the inverse random\ntime of the process [32]. On average, the rate of change\nf(t) = \u2202tN (t, 0) of the inverse random time gives the\nprobability that there is a noise event at time t. This\nrate is called the sprinkling distribution and is directly re-\nlated to the waiting-time distribution \u03c9(\u03c4) via a Laplace\ntransformation,\nf\u02dc(u) =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ndt e\u2212utf(t) =\nw\u02dc(u)\n1\u2212 w\u02dc(u) . (8)\nWe denote throughout the article Laplace-transformed\nfunctions by a tilde.\nFor small values of u, the power-law waiting-time dis-\ntribution (7) delivers\nw\u02dc(u) \u223c 1\u2212 u\u03c4 (\u03b1 > 1), (9)\nw\u02dc(u) \u223c 1\u2212 u\u03b1 cpi\n\u0393(\u03b1+ 1) sinpi\u03b1\n(\u03b1 < 1). (10)\nFor \u03b1 > 1, it then follows from Eq. (8) that the sprinkling\ndistribution takes a constant value at large times,\nf(t) \u223c 1\n\u03c4\n(\u03b1 > 1). (11)\nAs a result, the noise asymptotically becomes station-\nary in this case. However, for power-law waiting-time\ndistributions with \u03b1 < 1, the sprinkling distribution as-\nymptotically decays over time according to\nf(t) \u223c t\u03b1\u22121\u03b1 sin(pi\u03b1)\/(pic) (\u03b1 < 1). (12)\nDue to the explicit time dependence of f(t), the noise\nhere remains nonstationary. We note that nonstation-\nary also implies nonergodicity, since time averages cannot\nbe replaced by ensemble averages [19]. A direct conse-\nquence of Eq. (12) is that the mean inverse random time\nincreases sublinearly,\nN (t, 0) \u223c t\u03b1 sin(pi\u03b1)\/(pic) (\u03b1 < 1). (13)\nMore detailed information about the statistical prop-\nerties of the renewal process can be obtained by analyz-\ning the complete distribution function P(N ; t\u2032, t\u2032\u2032) of the\nnumber of noise events. The latter is most conveniently\ncharacterized by the moment-generating function\nM(z; t\u2032, t\u2032\u2032) = exp[zN (t\u2032, t\u2032\u2032)] =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\nezNP(N ; t\u2032, t\u2032\u2032).\n(14)\nFor general time arguments t\u2032 and t\u2032\u2032, this function can\nbe expressed as\nM(z; t\u2032, t\u2032\u2032) = M(z; t\u2032, 0)\n\u2212(ez \u2212 1)\n\u222b t\u2032\u2032\n0\nds f(s)M(z; t\u2032 \u2212 s, 0),\n(15)\nso that it suffices to study the moment-generating func-\ntion of the inverse random time N (t, 0).\nWe first relate the distribution function P(N ; t, 0) of\nthe inverse random time to the probability distribution\n4P (tN ;N ) of the N th random time, which succeeds via\nthe intuitive expression\nP(N ; t, 0) =\n\u222b t\n0\ndt\u2032 [P (t\u2032;N )\u2212 P (t\u2032;N + 1)]. (16)\nSince Eq. (6) involves a sum of N independent waiting\ntimes, the Laplace transform of P (tN ;N ) factorizes,\nP\u02dc (u;N ) = [w\u02dc(u)]N , (17)\nand Eq. (16) thus yields\nP\u02dc(N ;u, 0) =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ndt e\u2212utP(z; t, 0) = 1\nu\n[1\u2212w\u02dc(u)][w\u02dc(u)]N .\n(18)\n(As indicated, the Laplace transformation is taken with\nrespect to the later time argument). By using the defin-\nition (14) of the moment-generating function M(z; t, 0),\nwe find that its Laplace-transform can be expressed as a\nfunction of the sprinkling distribution,\nM\u02dc(z;u, 0) = 1\nu\n1\n1\u2212 f\u02dc(u)(ez \u2212 1) . (19)\nOne should note the explicit periodicity, M\u02dc(z;u, 0) =\nM\u02dc(z + 2pii;u, 0), which is a consequence of the discrete-\nness of the inverse random time.\nWhen next going back to the time domain, we again\nhave to distinguish between asymptotically stationary\nand nonstationary noise. In the former case (\u03b1 > 1),\nthe moment-generating function is asymptotically expo-\nnential,\nM(z; t, 0) \u223c exp[(ez \u2212 1)t\/\u03c4 ] (\u03b1 > 1). (20)\nEquation (20) characterizes the counting statistics of a\nPoisson process with mean rate \u03c4\u22121. In the nonstation-\nary case \u03b1 < 1, inserting the asymptotic behavior (10)\nproduces a moment-generating function of the form\nM(z; t, 0) \u223c E\u03b1[t\u03b1(ez\u22121)\u0393(1+\u03b1)(sinpi\u03b1)\/(pic)] (\u03b1 < 1),\n(21)\nwhere E\u03b1 is the Mittag-Leffler function [20], defined by\nE\u03b1(z) =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\nzn\n\u0393(\u03b1n+ 1)\n. (22)\nExpression (21) becomes exact for all times when one\npasses to continuous inverse times (ez \u2212 1\u2192 z) and con-\nsiders the particular case of a scale-free Le\u00b4vy process [32].\nThe moment-generating function then starts out as a\nstretched exponential, M(z; t, 0) ' exp{t\u03b1\/[\u0393(\u2212\u03b1)ctc]},\nwhile for large times it crosses over to the power law\nM(z; t, 0) ' (ctc\/\u03b1)t\u2212\u03b1. For more general waiting-time\ndistributions, a reasonable approximation is to adapt the\ntime argument by using the mean inverse random time,\nsuch that\nM(z; t, 0) \u2248 E\u03b1\n[\n(ez \u2212 1)\u0393(1 + \u03b1)N (t, 0)\n]\n(\u03b1 < 1).\n(23)\nThis results in the same power-law asymptotics for large\ntimes, and accounts for transient behavior in the initial\ndecay.\nC. Numerical implementation\nThroughout this paper we compare analytical results\nto results obtained from a numerical implementation of\nthe Le\u00b4vy kicked rotator. In the present section, we de-\nscribe the parameters used for these computations.\nDynamical localization is expected to be the strongest\nwhen h\u00af\/(2pi) is approximating a quadratic irrational \u03c9 =\n1\n2 (\n\u221a\na2 + 4\u2212a). In order to render the Hilbert space finite\nwe choose a = 24, set h\u00af = 2piM\/N , and use the third\nconvergent of the continued-fraction representation of the\nquadratic irrational, 124+\n1\n24+\n1\n24 . This gives M = 577,\nN = 13872.\nThe integer N is the Hilbert space dimension, which\nnow is large but finite, corresponding to a quantized mo-\nmentum p = h\u00afl, l = 0, 1, 2, . . . N \u2212 1. Similarly, in po-\nsition space the momentum quantization carries over to\ndiscretized positions \u03b8 = 2pil\/N . The integer M deter-\nmines the quantum-mechanical periodicity in momentum\nspace (p and p + 2piM are equivalent). Each classical\nperiod of 2pi covers N\/M \u2248 24 discretized momentum\nvalues.\nIn all our computations, the particle is initially pre-\npared in the zero-momentum state \u03c8(0) = |p = 0\u3009. The\nsubsequent propagation is obtained by successive appli-\ncation of the Floquet operator (4), which can be broken\ndown into the application of diagonal matrix multiplica-\ntions in momentum and position representation, inter-\nvened by Fast Fourier Transformations for the passage\nbetween both representations.\nIn each propagation step, the kicking strength is deter-\nmined according to the following procedure. The regular\nkicking strength is set to K = 7.5. The noisy perturba-\ntions kn are taken from a uniform box distribution over\nan interval (\u2212W,W ), so that \u03ba = W 2\/3. This noise\nis only applied at times selected by a renewal process,\nwhich we generate by the so-called Yule-Simon distribu-\ntions [33]\n\u03c9(\u03c4) =\n\u03b1\u0393(\u03c4)\u0393(\u03b1+ 1)\n\u0393(\u03c4 + \u03b1+ 1)\n.

(25)\nThe mean waiting time is given by\n\u03c4 =\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\u2212 1 (\u03b1 > 1) (26)\nand diverges for \u03b1 < 1.

DECOHERENCE IN QUASIENERGY\nSPACE\nThe effect of noise on the quantum kicked rotator has\nbeen first investigated by Ott, Antonsen and Hanson,\nwho developed the following intuitive picture [14]. In the\nabsence of noise the quantum system is fully coherent:\nthe quasienergy eigenstates of the Floquet operator F (K)\nare exponentially localized in momentum space, chaotic\ndiffusion is strongly suppressed and the momentum diffu-\nsion constant asymptotically vanishes. The effect of the\nexternal noise is to couple the quasienergy states and to\ninduce transitions between them. As a result, dynamical\nlocalization is extenuated and quantum diffusion takes\nplace.\nA systematic approach for calculating the non-zero\nquantum diffusion constant in the presence of station-\nary noise has been developed by Cohen [15]. It is based\non an analysis of the decay of a decoherence factor which\nis related to the survival probability of the quasienergy\nstates of the Floquet operator. In Ref. [15] this deco-\nherence factor was calculated perturbatively for short\ntimes (the emphasis was on stationary noise with ar-\nbitrary correlations, including the intricate correlations\nof zero-temperature noise). In the following, we use\na simple random-phase approximation to calculate the\ndecoherence factor beyond the perturbative short-time\nregime. This approximation is valid for random uncorre-\nlated noise events and remains immediately applicable to\nnoise generated by a renewal process, including the case\nof nonergodic, nonstationary Le\u00b4vy noise.\nA. Quasienergy transitions and decoherence factor\nThe quasienergy eigenstates |r\u3009 of the noiseless system\nare defined by the eigenvalue equation\nF (K)|r\u3009 = exp(\u2212i\u03b5r)|r\u3009, (29)\nwhere \u03b5r is the quasienergy. A noise-free propagation\nstep does not alter the quasienergy state, while a noisy\nkick introduces transitions with amplitude\n\u3008s|F (Kn)|s\u2032\u3009 = exp(\u2212i\u03b5s)\u3008s| exp(\u2212ih\u00af\u22121kn cos \u03b8)|s\u2032\u3009,\n(30)\nwhere s\u2032 and s are the quasienergy index before and after\nthe propagation step, respectively.\nOver a larger time interval [t\u2032\u2032, t\u2032), the survival ampli-\ntude in a quasienergy state |r\u3009 is defined as\nAr(t\u2032, t\u2032\u2032) = \u3008r|T\nt\u2032\u22121\u220f\nn=t\u2032\u2032\nF (Kn)|r\u3009 exp[i(t\u2032 \u2212 t\u2032\u2032)\u03b5r], (31)\nwhere T is the time-ordering operator. In this expres-\nsion, we have explicitly provided for two time arguments,\nas is required when working with a renewal process\nwhich may produce nonstationary noise. The exponen-\ntial factor compensates for the dynamical accumulation\nof quasienergy phases in the noiseless system, for which\nAr(t\u2032, t\u2032\u2032) = 1.\nThe averaged survival amplitude is denoted by\nD(1)(t\u2032, t\u2032\u2032) = Ar(t\u2032, t\u2032\u2032), (32)\nwhere the average is over the index r as well as over the\ntiming and amplitude of the noise.\nThe decoherence factor D(t\u2032, t\u2032\u2032) that later appears in\nthe momentum spreading and in the decay of the purity\nis given by\nD(t\u2032, t\u2032\u2032) = Ar(t\u2032, t\u2032\u2032)A\u2217s(t\u2032, t\u2032\u2032), (33)\nwhere the average now extends over both quasienergy\nindices r 6= s.\nB. Average over amplitude noise\nIn order to analyze the decoherence factor, we first as-\nsume that the timing of noise events is fixed and average\nover the random detunings kn of the noise events, as well\nas over the quasienergy indices. These averages become\nstraightforward within a random-phase approximation,\n6which uses that the random detunings are uncorrelated\nand moreover exploits features of the complex quantum\ndynamics encoded in the quasienergy transition ampli-\ntudes (30). For this we have to distinguish amplitudes\nwhich preserve the quasienergy index (diagonal matrix\nelements, which are of modulus one if there is no noise\nand less than one in the presence of noise) from ampli-\ntudes describing transitions between quasienergy states\n(off-diagonal matrix elements, which are only finite in the\npresence of noise).\nFor noise strength \u03ba\u00bf h\u00af2 the averaged modulus of the\ndiagonal matrix elements in Eq. (30) can be obtained in\na simple expansion,\nexp(\u2212ih\u00af\u22121kl cos \u03b8) \u2248 1\u2212 (\u03ba\/2h\u00af2) cos2 \u03b8 = 1\u2212 \u03ba\/4h\u00af2,\n(34)\nwhich delivers the survival time\ntc ' 2h\u00af2\/\u03ba. (35)\nWe will shortly see that tc coincides with the decoher-\nence time for conventional amplitude noise, which acts\nstationarily in every kick. The condition set for the noise\nstrength implies tc \u00c0 1. This assumption is not very\nrestrictive, since it only prevents total decoherence by a\nsingle event, but does not impose any restriction on tc\nwith respect to the localization time t\u2217 ' K2\/2h\u00af2, which\nis also much larger than unity. We hence reserve the\nnotion of weak noise for the more restrictive condition\n\u03ba\u00bf h\u00af4\/K2, which implies tc \u00c0 t\u2217.\nEach noise event mixes the initial quasienergy state\ninto about \u03be = t\u2217\/2\u00c0 1 states whose localization centers\nare in reach of the localization length [30]. Each individ-\nual off-diagonal transition amplitude hence is small, and\nfor weak noise (tc \u00c0 t\u2217) the averaged off-diagonal matrix\nelements indeed can be trivially neglected. The averaged\nFloquet operator F (Kn) is then simply approximated by\n\u3008s|F (Kn)|s\u2032\u3009 = \u03b4s,s\u2032diag[e\u2212i\u03b5s\u22121\/(2tc)], (36)\nwhich is diagonal in quasienergy space.\nWhen tc and t\u2217 are of comparable order, individual\ncontributions which include quasienergy transitions are\nstill small, but in the composed survival amplitude (31)\none cannot disregard the proliferation of such terms when\nthe number of transitions is increased. It then becomes\nnecessary to exploit the consequences of the complex\ndynamics of the kicked rotator, which induces random\nphases into the off-diagonal transition matrix elements.\nThe random phase has several separate origins:\n(1) For fixed s and s\u2032, the transition amplitude (30)\nsensitively depends on the random detuning kn of the\nkick.\n(2) In momentum space, the quasienergy states have\nan exponentially decaying envelope, but a quasi-random\ninternal structure. Consequently, even after the average\nover the detuning, the phase of the transition amplitude\ndepends strongly on the quasienergy indices s and s\u2032.\nIn the ensuing random-phase approximation, the phase\nof the off-diagonal transition amplitudes is assumed to be\nuniformly distributed in [0, 2pi), while the squared mod-\nulus of these matrix elements is of order 2\/(tct\u2217) (corre-\nsponding to the bandwidth \u03be = t\u2217\/2). The squared mod-\nulus of the diagonal elements is given by exp(\u22121\/tc) \u2248\n1\u2212 1\/tc.\nIn this approximation, the averaged Floquet operator\nF (Kn) simply retains its diagonal form (36). This is\nall we need for the computation of the averaged survival\namplitude D(1)(t\u2032, t\u2032\u2032) and leads to the intermediate ex-\npression\nD(1)(t\u2032, t\u2032\u2032) = exp[\u2212N (t\u2032, t\u2032\u2032)\/(2tc)], (37)\nwhere N (t\u2032, t\u2032\u2032) is the inverse random time of the renewal\nprocess as introduced in Sec. II.\nThe random phase approximation also establishes a di-\nrect connection between D(1)(t\u2032, t\u2032\u2032) and the decoherence\nfactor D(t\u2032, t\u2032\u2032). Since in Eq. (33) the two quasienergy in-\ndices r and s are not identical, there are no contributions\nwhich link the quasienergy states in exactly the same se-\nquence. The decoherence factor therefore immediately\nfactorizes into the averaged survival amplitudes of the\ntwo quasienergy states, yielding\nD(t\u2032, t\u2032\u2032) = [D(1)(t\u2032, t\u2032\u2032)]2 = exp[\u2212N (t\u2032, t\u2032\u2032)\/tc]. (38)\nThe remaining average over the timing of the noise events\ndoes not factorize, but because of the simple exponential\nform of Eq. (37), merely amounts to a factor of two in\nthe exponent. We now analyze this average for different\ntypes of renewal processes.\nC. Average over timing noise\nIn the conventional case of stationary noise with\n\u03c9(\u03c4) = \u03b4\u03c4,1, where timing noise is absent, the inverse\nrandom time, N (t\u2032, t\u2032\u2032) = t\u2032\u2032 \u2212 t\u2032, does not fluctuate. Ac-\ncording to Eq. (38), the decoherence factor\nD(t\u2032, t\u2032\u2032) = exp[\u2212(t\u2032 \u2212 t\u2032\u2032)\/tc] (stationary noise) (39)\nthen decays exponentially over time, and tc is identical\nto the coherence time.\nFor noise generated by a renewal process with power-\nlaw waiting-time distributions, the subsequent analysis\ndepends on whether the process is characterized by a\nmean waiting time \u03c4 , or shows the nonstationary fea-\ntures of Le\u00b4vy noise. This bifurcation can be made explicit\nby realizing that Eq. (37) is identical to the moment-\ngenerating function M(z; t\u2032, t\u2032\u2032) of the number of noise\nevents, introduced in Eq. (14), which has to be evaluated\nat the noise-strength dependent value z = \u22121\/tc. We\ntherefore can immediately exploit the results of Sec. II B.\n(Since we assume tc \u00c0 1 we can set ez \u2212 1 \u2248 \u22121\/tc.)\nIt follows from Eq. (20) that, when the noise is as-\nymptotically stationary (\u03b1 > 1), the decoherence factor\nretains its exponential form,\nD(t\u2032, t\u2032\u2032) \u223c exp[\u2212(t\u2032 \u2212 t\u2032\u2032)\/\u03c4tc] (\u03b1 > 1).

Averaged distribution of momenta P (p; t) at selected times t for kicked rotators which are subjected\nto Le\u00b4vy noise generated by a Yule-Simon distribution. The average is over 103 realizations. The smooth curves are fits to\ndouble-sided exponential and Gaussian distributions. The unit of momentum is the localization length p\u2217 = D\u2217\/h\u00af. (a) In the\nupper panels \u03b1 = 2.0, \u03ba = 1\/30000, corresponding to a decoherence time tc = 12.3 t\n\u2217 (where t\u2217 is the localization time). At\nt = 15 t\u2217 \u2248 1.2 tc the distribution function fluctuates around a double-sided exponential function. At t = 30 t\u2217 \u2248 2.4 tc the\ndistribution function is still exponential, but the fluctuations are suppressed. At t = 120 t\u2217 \u2248 9.8 tc the distribution function\nis well described by a Gaussian. (b) In the lower panels \u03b1 = 0.5, \u03ba = 1\/3, corresponding to stronger but nonstationary,\nincreasingly rare noise events. In this case, a decoherence time cannot be defined and the distributions function remains\nexponential for all times t > t\u2217. Note that the peak at p = 0 arises from coherent backscattering.\nThe effective coherence time \u03c4tc is directly proportional\nto the mean waiting time of the noisy kicks and therefore\nincreases with decreasing exponent \u03b1. In particular, the\neffective coherence time becomes infinitely large when \u03b1\ndrops below unity. According to Eq. (23), the functional\nform of the decoherence factor then changes to\nD(t, 0) \u2248 E\u03b1\n[\n\u2212\u0393(1 + \u03b1)N (t, 0)\/tc\n]\n(\u03b1 < 1). (41)\nAfter a (typically short) transient, N (t, 0) \u223c\nt\u03b1 sin(pi\u03b1)\/(pic). Hence, we have the remarkable result\nthat Le\u00b4vy noise induces a nonexponential loss of coher-\nence which typically starts out as a stretched exponential,\nD(t, 0) ' exp[t\u03b1\/(\u0393(\u2212\u03b1)ctc)], (initial decay), (42)\nand for large times crosses over to a power law,\nD(t, 0) ' (ctc\/\u03b1)t\u2212\u03b1 (asymptotic decay). (43)\nThe functional dependence of the decoherence factor can\nthus be changed in a controlled manner by tuning the\nvalue of the exponent \u03b1. We now explore how this affects\nthe observable properties of the kicked rotator.\nIV. MOMENTUM SPREADING\nIn the atom-optical experiments, the momentum can\nbe observed by a time-of-flight measurement, where the\nkicking sequence is terminated at a specified time t and\nthe atom cloud is allowed to expand ballistically to a\nmuch larger size. A snapshot is then taken and the travel\ndistance is converted into the momentum. This technique\nprovides direct access to the complete momentum distri-\nbution P (p; t) and has been successfully applied in the\nrecent experiments of Refs. [6\u20138].\nIn the presence of dynamical localization, the mo-\nmentum distribution shows the exponential envelope of\nthe atomic wavefunctions in momentum space, while a\nGaussian envelope is expected when diffusive momentum\nspreading is induced by stationary timing or amplitude\nnoise. In order to give an early indication of the effects\nof nonexponential decoherence, we compare in Fig. 3 the\nmomentum distribution of Le\u00b4vy kicked rotators with as-\nymptotically stationary and nonstationary noise (\u03b1 = 2\nand \u03b1 = 1\/2, respectively). For \u03b1 = 2, the strength\nof the noise is set to \u03ba = 1\/30000, corresponding to a\ndecoherence time tc = 12.3 t\u2217. For t <\u223c tc the distribu-\ntion function is well described by a double-sided expo-\n8 0\n 0.1\n-8 -6 -4 -2  0  2  4  6  8\nP(\np)p\n*\np\/p*\n(a) \u03b1=2\n\u03ba=1\/300\nt=15t*\n 0\n 0.2\n 0.4\n 0.6\n 0.8\n 1\n-8 -6 -4 -2  0  2  4  6  8\nP(\np)p\n*\np\/p*\n(b) \u03b1=0.5\n\u03ba=1\/300\nFIG. 4: (color online). Same as the left panels in Fig. 3, but\nfor \u03ba = 1\/300 (tc = 0.12 t\n\u2217), so that t = 15 t\u2217 \u00c0 tc.\nnential function; when the time is increased it eventually\nevolves into a Gaussian distribution. This follows the\nexpectations for conventional stationary noise. By con-\ntrast, for \u03b1 = 1\/2, where a well defined coherence time\ndoes not exist, the probability density keeps its double-\nsided exponential shape at all times. This is the case\neven though we increased the strength of the individual\nnoise events by four orders of magnitude to \u03ba = 1\/3, so\nthat tc = 0.00123 t\u2217 is much reduced. This indicates that\ndiffusive momentum spreading is never attained, even in\nthe limit of very strong noise events.\nFigure 4 shows the momentum distribution at t = 15t\u2217\nfor the more moderate noise strength \u03ba = 1\/300 (tc =\n0.12 t\u2217) which is used in several subsequent figures in this\nwork. For \u03b1 = 2.0, the momentum distribution is always\nwell-approximated by a Gaussian, while for \u03b1 = 0.5 and\nt > t\u2217, it is well-approximated by a double-sided expo-\nnential function as soon as t > t\u2217.\nWe now proceed to characterize the evolution of the\nmomentum distribution by two quantities, the variance\nvar p and the inverse participation ratio (IPR).\nA. Variance of momentum\nThe temporal evolution of the momentum distribu-\ntion P (p; t) has two origins. The first component is the\nspreading of the momentum wavefunction of an individ-\nual atom with respect to the mean momentum of the\natom. This momentum spreading is characterized by the\nvariance,\nvar p(t) = \u3008p2\u3009 \u2212 \u3008p\u30092. (44)\nAs indicated, this variance is computed from the\nquantum-mechanical expectation values, and then aver-\naged over the noise. The second component of the evo-\nlution of the momentum distribution is the spreading of\nthe mean momenta of the different atoms. Hence, in\ngeneral, the variance (44) is smaller than the total vari-\nance computed from the momentum distribution P (p; t).\nIn the particular case of the kicked rotator, however,\nthis difference becomes negligible, due to the symmetry\n(\u03b8, p) \u2192 (\u2212\u03b8,\u2212p) which holds even in presence of the\nnoise.\nIn the following, we first establish a general relation\nbetween the variance of the momentum of the noise-free\nand noisy systems, and then evaluate this relation for\nthe Le\u00b4vy kicked rotator. We will then find that nonex-\nponential decoherence manifests itself in a subdiffusive\nspreading of the momentum.\nAs in the earlier theories of delocalization due to de-\ncoherence [15], the starting point of our considerations is\nthe force-force correlation function,\nC(t\u2032, t\u2032\u2032) = \u3008Kt\u2032Kt\u2032\u2032 sin \u03b8t\u2032 sin \u03b8t\u2032\u2032\u3009, (45)\nwhich is composed of the momentum increments in an\nindividual time step, as given by Eq. (2). In the above\nequation, \u03b8t is the angle operator in the Heisenberg pic-\nture. The average includes an average over the initial\nmomentum of the particle, so that the expectation value\nis replaced by the normalized trace N\u22121trN , where N is\nthe Hilbert space dimension.\nThe total change of the momentum is obtained by inte-\ngrating the force over time. The variance therefore reads\nvar p(t) =\nt\u22121\u2211\nt\u2032,t\u2032\u2032=0\nC(t\u2032, t\u2032\u2032). (46)\nIn order to establish the relation to the decoherence\nfactor, the force-force correlation function is expanded in\nthe basis of quasienergy eigenstates [15],\n9C(t\u2032, t\u2032\u2032) =\n\u2032\u2211\n{rn,sn}\n\u3008rt\u2032 | sin \u03b8|st\u2032\u3009\u3008st\u2032\u2032 | sin \u03b8|rt\u2032\u2032\u3009Kt\u2032Kt\u2032\u2032\nt\u2032\u22121\u220f\nl,m=t\u2032\u2032\n\u3008rl|F (Kl)|rl+1\u3009\u2217\u3008sm+1|F (Km)|sm\u3009. (47)\nThe prime in the sum over quasienergy indices excludes\nthe initial index rt\u2032\u2032 , which originates from the normal-\nized trace and hence instead is averaged over.\nWe first apply the random-phase approximation to the\nmatrix elements of the sine kicking potential, which in\nprinciple selects three types of terms: (i) terms with rt\u2032 =\nrt\u2032\u2032 , st\u2032 = st\u2032\u2032 , but rt\u2032 6= st\u2032 ; (ii) terms with rt\u2032 = st\u2032 ,\nrt\u2032\u2032 = st\u2032\u2032 , but rt\u2032 6= rt\u2032\u2032 ; (iii) terms with rt\u2032 = rt\u2032\u2032 = st\u2032 =\nst\u2032\u2032 .\nThe terms of type (ii) and (iii) involve the expec-\ntation value of the force, which vanishes in the spe-\ncific case of the kicked rotator, thanks to the symmetry\n(\u03b8, p) \u2192 (\u2212\u03b8,\u2212p) (a careful analysis of such terms will\nbe required for the purity, see Section V). For the terms\nof type (i), on the other hand, the product of transition\nmatrix elements \u3008rl|F (Kl)|rl+1\u3009 in quasienergy space ex-\nactly arranges itself into the definition of the decoher-\nence factor (33). This correspondence also holds when\nC(t\u2032, t\u2032\u2032) is evaluated for t\u2032 < t\u2032\u2032, provided we define\nD(t\u2032, t\u2032\u2032) = D(t\u2032\u2032, t\u2032).\nFor t\u2032 = t\u2032\u2032, the average over the noise also gives rise to\na contribution to the typical force acting on the particle\nof the form K2t\u2032\u3008sin \u03b82\u3009 = K2\/2 + (\u03ba\/2)f(t\u2032), where f(t)\nis the sprinkling distribution. Collecting all terms, we\narrive at\nC(t\u2032, t\u2032\u2032) = C0(t\u2032, t\u2032\u2032)D(t\u2032, t\u2032\u2032) + \u03ba2 f(t\n\u2032)\u03b4t\u2032,t\u2032\u2032 , (48)\nwhere C0(t\u2032, t\u2032\u2032) is the force-force correlation function in\nthe absence of noise. Besides the correction from the\nsprinkling distribution, which is small for weak noise, this\nrecovers the result from the perturbative short-time the-\nory in Ref. [15]. It follows that the correct extrapolation\nof the decoherence factor beyond the initial decay is given\nby Eq. (38).\nThe variance of the momentum follows when Eq. (48)\nis inserted into Eq. (46). It is then convenient to pass\nto a continuous time argument and perform integrations\nby parts, so that all force correlations are expressed in\nterms of the variance of the momentum in absence of the\nnoise, which we denote by var p0(t). We then obtain as\none of our main results the following expression,\nvar p(t) = var p0(t)D(t, 0) + \u03ba2N (t, 0)\n+\n\u222b t\n0\nds var p0(t\u2212 s) \u2202sD(t, s)\n\u2212\n\u222b t\n0\nds var p0(s) \u2202sD(s, 0)\n\u2212\n\u222b t\n0\nds\u2032\n\u222b s\u2032\n0\nds\u2032\u2032 var p0(s\u2032 \u2212 s\u2032\u2032) \u2202s\u2032\u2202s\u2032\u2032D(s\u2032, s\u2032\u2032). (49)\nThe second term on the right hand side can be neglected\nfor small noise strength \u03ba. Equation (49) expresses the\nmomentum variance in presence of noise exclusively in\nterms of the variance in absence of the noise, and deriv-\natives of the decoherence factor D(t\u2032, t\u2032\u2032), which play the\nrole of memory kernels. Because of the monotonicity\nproperties of D(t\u2032, t\u2032\u2032) all terms are positive. Since the\nresult is expressed directly in terms of var p0, Eq. (49)\nmoreover accounts for all dynamical correlations of the\nnoiseless dynamics. In particular, the random-phase ap-\nproximation used in the derivation only relies on the com-\nplex quantum-dynamics of the noiseless system, but does\nnot require that it displays dynamical localization.\nIn exploring the consequences of Eq. (49) for the kicked\nrotator, we combine Eq. (5) for the momentum variance\nin absence of the noise with the various\ndecoherence factors found in Section III. First, let us\nagain make contact with the known results for stationary\nnoise, for which the decoherence factor decays exponen-\ntially as given in Eq. (39). The corresponding momentum\nspreading is\nvar p =\nD\u2217\n1 + tc\/t\u2217\nt+\nD\u2217t\u2217\n(1 + t\u2217\/tc)2\n[1\u2212 exp(\u2212t\/t\u2217 \u2212 t\/tc)].\n(50)\nThis result was first proposed in Ref. [15] as one of two\npossible extrapolations of the perturbative short-time re-\nsults, and has been successfully applied to quantify the\ndecoherence process in the experiment of Ref. [7]. The\npresent derivation shows that the other proposed extrap-\nolation indeed was rightfully discarded. For large times,\nthe second term approaches a constant and can be ne-\nglected in comparison to the first term, which increases\nlinearly in time. Hence, for stationary noise when quan-\ntum coherence is lost exponentially, the momentum dif-\nfuses asymptotically with a renormalized diffusion con-\nstant D\u2217\/(1 + tc\/t\u2217).\nIn the presence of asymptotically stationary noise gen-\nerated by a renewal process with \u03b1 > 1, the decoherence\nfunction is given by Eq. (40), in which the coherence\ntime is modified by the mean waiting \u03c4 . This does not\ninduce any qualitative change in the momentum spread-\ning, which is still diffusive according to a renormalized\ndiffusion constant D\u2217\/(1 + \u03c4tc\/t\u2217).\nAs \u03b1 approaches unity from above, the decoherence\ntime increases, and the quantum diffusion constant van-\nishes at \u03b1 = 1. It is clear that this has to be accompanied\nby a qualitative change of the momentum spreading it-\nself. For \u03b1 < 1, the asymptotic spreading is dominated\nby the last term in Eq. (49), which can be approximated\n10\nas\nvar p(t) \u223c \u2212var p0(\u221e)\n\u222b t\n0\nds\u2032\n\u222b s\u2032\n0\nds\u2032\u2032 \u2202s\u2032\u2202s\u2032\u2032D(s\u2032, s\u2032\u2032)\n=\nD\u2217t\u2217\ntc\nN (t, 0). (51)\nUsing the power-law asymptotics (13) of the inverse ran-\ndom time for \u03b1 \u2264 1, we immediately find that the mo-\nmentum spreads subdiffusively,\nvar p(t) \u223c D\n\u2217t\u2217\ntc\nsinpi\u03b1\npic\nt\u03b1. (52)\nThe full time dependence of the momentum variance\nof Le\u00b4vy kicked rotators with asymptotically stationary\nor non-stationary noise is shown in Fig. 5. The upper\npanel shows the results for \u03b1 = 2, for which the momen-\ntum spreading is diffusive. The classical diffusion is at-\ntained for moderate noise strength \u03ba >\u223c 1\/300. The lower\npanel shows the results for \u03b1 = 1\/2, and confirms that\nin this case the spreading is subdiffusive, var p \u221d t1\/2.\nNote that this behavior persists even when the strength\nof the individual noise events is large. The theoreti-\ncal predictions in the plots follow from Eq. (49), where\nvar p0(t) is taken from Eq. (5), while D(t\u2032, t\u2032\u2032) is deter-\nmined for Eq. (38) [i.e., the moment-generating function\nof N (t\u2032, t\u2032\u2032) for the Yule-Simon distribution is evaluated\nat z = \u22121\/tc = \u2212\u03ba\/2h\u00af2]. There is good agreement be-\ntween the numerical results and the theoretical predic-\ntions.\nB. Inverse participation ratio\nIn this section we study an alternative measure of\nthe momentum spreading, the inverse participation ratio\n(IPR), and show that this quantity also reveals the exis-\ntence of two distinct (exponential and non-exponential)\ndecoherence regimes. The inverse participation ratio is\ndefined as\nIPR(t) =\n\u2211\nn\n|\u03c8n(t)|4, (53)\nwhere \u03c8n are the amplitudes of the wavefunction in a\nfixed basis. The IPR can be interpreted as a measure for\nthe inverse dimension of an effective Hilbert space ex-\nplored by the quantum dynamics. In general, the IPR\nis basis dependent. In the following, we provide a quasi-\nclassical estimate of the IPR by introducing basis states\nwhich cover Planck cells of area 2pih\u00af in phase-space and\nare centered at phase-space positions (\u03b8n, pn). This esti-\nmate turns out to be independent on the details of the\nquasiclassical basis.\nFor a given time, the complex amplitudes \u03c8n fluctuate\nas n is varied, corresponding to speckle noise in the phase-\nspace position (\u03b8n, pn). In order to quantify these fluctu-\nations, we introduce a phase-space function P (\u03b8n, pn; t)\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n 0  10  20  30  40  50  60  70  80\nv\nar\n p\n \n\/ D\n*\nt*\nt\/t*\n1\/7500\n1\/1200\n1\/300\n1\/75\n1\/12\n\u03ba=1\/3\n\u03b1=0.5\ncl\nas\nsic\nal\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n         \nv\nar\n p\n \n\/ D\n*\nt*\n \n1\/750000\n1\/120000\n1\/30000\n1\/75001\/1200\u03ba=1\/300\n\u03b1=2.0\ncl\nas\nsic\nal\nFIG. 5: (color online). Time dependence of the momentum\nspreading var p(t) for kicked rotators which are subjected to\nLe\u00b4vy noise generated by a Yule-Simon distribution with noise\nexponent \u03b1 = 2.0 (panel a) and \u03b1 = 0.5 (panel b). The results\nof numerical computations (solid curves) are compared to the\ntheoretical prediction from Eq. (49) (dashed curves). The\nstraight solid line labelled \u201dclassical\u201d is the classical diffusion.\nsuch that the statistical average of the squared amplitude\nis\n|\u03c8n(t)|2 \u2261 2pih\u00afP (\u03b8n, pn; t). (54)\nBy assuming that the real and imaginary parts of \u03c8n are\nGaussian distributed and independent, we have\n|\u03c8n(t)|4 = 2|\u03c8n(t)|22. (55)\nIn the quasiclassical approximation, the function\nP (\u03b8, p; t) is now identified with a smooth, properly nor-\nmalized phase space density with continuous variables \u03b8\nand p. By combining Eqs. (54) and (55), the IPR can\nthen be written in the form\nIPR(t) =\n\u222b\nd\u03b8 dp\n2pih\u00af\n\u00d7 2[2pih\u00afP (\u03b8, p; t)]2 . (56)\nThe above expression is invariant under canonical trans-\nformations of the phase-space variables and hence ex-\nhibits the advertised independence of details of the quasi-\nclassical basis.\nIn the Le\u00b4vy kicked rotator, the quasiclassical proba-\nbility density becomes \u03b8-independent after a short time,\nso that to a good approximation P (\u03b8, p; t) ' P (p; t)\/2pi.\n11\nThis leads to a compact expression for the IPR,\nIPR(t) = 2h\u00af\n\u222b\ndpP 2(p; t). (57)\nThe integral in Eq. (57) can be calculated in two\nsimple cases: For a Gaussian profile, P (p; t) =\n(2pivar p(t))\u22121\/2 exp[\u2212p2\/2var p(t)], typical for diffusive\nspreading, we obtain\nIPR(t) =\nh\u00af\u221a\npivar p(t)\n(Gaussian profile). (58)\nOn the other hand, for a double-sided exponential prob-\nability distribution, P (p; t) = (\u03bb\/2) exp(\u2212\u03bb|p|) with \u03bb =\u221a\n2\/var p, we find\nIPR(t) =\nh\u00af\u221a\n2var p(t)\n(exponential profile). (59)\nInterestingly, in both Eqs. (58) and (59) the IPR is pro-\nportional to h\u00af\/\n\u221a\nvar p(t). In view of Eq. (52), we hence\nexpect that the asymptotic decay of the IPR is a power-\nlaw with exponent \u22121\/2 for \u03b1 > 1, while for \u03b1 < 1\nthe exponent is reduced to \u2212\u03b1\/2. These predictions are\nconfirmed by the numerical results shown in Fig. 6. We\ncan therefore conclude that the quasiclassical expressions\n(58) and (59) offer a good quantitative estimate of the\nIPR of the Le\u00b4vy kicked rotator.\nV. PURITY AND FIDELITY\nA convenient quantity to further elucidate the loss of\ncoherence in a quantum-dynamical system is the fidelity\n[22, 23, 34, 35],\nF(t) = |\u3008\u03c8(t)|\u03c8\u2032(t)\u3009|2, (60)\nwhere the states \u03c8(t) and \u03c8\u2032(t) start out from the same\ninitial condition \u03c8(0) = \u03c8\u2032(0), but are propagated with\ndifferent realizations of the noise. An extensive review\nof the intricate features of the fidelity can be found in\nRef. [24].\nA remarkable property of the fidelity is that it can be\ndirectly probed in an echo experiment [25]. In the latter,\nthe quantum state is first let to evolve up to a certain\ntime t at which the dynamics is reversed, e.g., by ap-\nplying a pulse that inverts the momentum (p \u2192 \u2212p).\nWhen at time 2t the momentum-reverting pulse is ap-\nplied again, the system approximately returns into its\ninitial state. The fidelity characterizes the quality of this\necho, which is never perfect because of imperfections in\nthe momentum-reverting pulse and the noise in the dy-\nnamics. The destruction of phase coherence in a quan-\ntum system such as the kicked rotator can therefore be\ndirectly studied in echo-like experiments. To our knowl-\nedge such a measurement has not yet been performed\nin kicked rotator experiments.

Time dependence of the inverse par-\nticipation ratio IPR for kicked rotators which are subjected\nto Le\u00b4vy noise generated by a Yule-Simon distribution with\n\u03ba = 1\/300. The main panels are single-logarithmic while\nthe insets show the same data in a double-logarithmic pre-\nsentation. (a) Noise with exponent \u03b1 = 2.0, corresponding\nto a decoherence time tc = 0.12 t\n\u2217 (where t\u2217 is the local-\nization time) so that the momentum distribution P (p; t) is\nalways well-approximated by a Gaussian. The dashed line is\nthe quasi-classical prediction (58). (b) Noise with exponent\n\u03b1 = 0.5, where for t > t\u2217 the momentum distribution P (p; t) is\nalways well-approximated by a double-sided exponential func-\ntion. The dashed line is the quasi-classical prediction (59).\nproposals on how to measure the fidelity in atom-optical\nexperiments have been put forward [26\u201328].\nIn the present section, we study various statistical as-\npects of the fidelity for the case that its decay is induced\nby Le\u00b4vy noise.\nA. Purity\nThe statistical average of the fidelity\nF(t) = tr \u03c12(t) (61)\nis formally equivalent to the so-called purity of the statis-\ntical mixture of the perturbed states, which is described\n12\nby the density operator\n\u03c1(t) = |\u03c8(t)\u3009\u3008\u03c8(t)|. (62)\nThe average is over the amplitude and timing noise gen-\nerated by the renewal process. The initial state is fixed,\nso that the purity starts at tr \u03c12(0) = 1. For completely\nincoherent superpositions the purity tends to the value\n1\/N , where N is the Hilbert space dimension.\nIn the following, we show that the initial and inter-\nmediate decay of the purity is directly related to the de-\ncoherence function D(t). For the long-time asymptotics,\nwe moreover establish a connection to the inverse partic-\nipation ratio.\nIn the quasienergy basis, starting from Eq. (61), the\npurity can be expanded as\ntr \u03c12(t) =\n\u2032\u2211\n{rn,sn,r\u2032n,s\u2032n}\n\u03c8r0\u03c8\n\u2217\nr\u20320\n\u03c8\u2217s0\u03c8s\u20320\nt\u22121\u220f\nl,m,l\u2032,m\u2032=0\n\u3008rl+1|F (Kl)|rl\u3009\u3008r\u2032l\u2032+1|F (K \u2032l\u2032)|r\u2032l\u2032\u3009\u2217\u3008sm+1|F (Km)|sm\u3009\u2217\u3008s\u2032m\u2032+1|F (K \u2032m\u2032)|s\u2032m\u2032\u3009,\n(63)\nwhere the prime in the sum denotes the constraint rt =\nr\u2032t, st = s\n\u2032\nt. Furthermore, \u03c8r is the initial wavefunction,\nexpanded in the quasienergy eigenbasis, and the values\nKl and K \u2032l are obtained from independent realizations of\nthe renewal process, which differ both in the timing as\nwell as in the detunings of the noisy kicks.\nWe first apply the random-phase approximation to the\nexpansion coefficients \u03c8r, which selects three groups of\nterms: (i) terms with r0 = r\u20320, s0 = s\n\u2032\n0, but r0 6= s0; (ii)\nterms with r0 = s0, r\u20320 = s\n\u2032\n0, but r0 6= r\u20320; (iii) terms with\nr0 = r\u20320 = s0 = s\n\u2032\n0.\nFor each class of terms, the random-phase averages\nover the detunings and timing of the noisy kicks can be\ncarried out following the procedure which we applied to\nthe decoherence factor and the survival probability in\nquasienergy space, described in Section III. For the terms\nof group (i), this procedure selects only diagonal matrix\nelements with fixed rn = r\u2032n \u2261 r, sn = s\u2032n \u2261 s, just as en-\ncountered for the decoherence factor. Since we now deal\nwith two independent renewal processes, they deliver a\nfactor exp[\u2212N (t, 0)\/tc + N \u2032(t, 0)\/tc] which depends on\nthe sum of inverse random times in the propagation of\nthe two states. After averaging over the timing noise\nof the two independent renewal processes, these terms\ntherefore deliver a factor D2(t, 0).\nAmong the terms of group (ii), the random-phase ap-\nproximation requires to pair all amplitudes to probabil-\nities, rn = sn, r\u2032n = s\n\u2032\nn. In the calculation of the vari-\nance var p(t), these terms could be neglected because they\nwere multiplied by the vanishing expectation value of the\ndetuned force. We shall denote these contributions by\nSr\u2192s,cl(t, 0).\nAmong the terms of group (iii), both terms which are\ncompletely diagonal (type i) as well as terms which are\npaired to probabilities (type ii) survive. A neat sepa-\nration of these terms follows when we require that for\nr = s, the terms are called of type (ii) when they contain\nat least one quasienergy change. Appropriately attribut-\ning these terms to the groups (i) and (ii), the purity then\ntakes the form\ntr \u03c12(t) =\n\u2211\nr,s\n|\u03c8r|2|\u03c8s|2[D2(t, 0) + Sr\u2192s,cl(t, 0)], (64)\nwhere the restriction r 6= s is now lifted.\nFor the term proportional to D2(t, 0) we can now ex-\nploit the normalization of the initial wavefunction. Look-\ning at the second term, it easy to see that these contri-\nbutions can be neglected for short times t\u00bf tc, since per\ndefinition they contain at least one quasi-energy transi-\ntion. The significance of these terms becomes apparent\nwhen one re-evaluates the purity for long times. For this\nwe start from the general expression,\ntr \u03c12(t) =\n\u2211\nnm\n\u03c8\u2217n(t)\u03c8\u2032n(t)\u03c8\u2032\u2217m(t)\u03c8m(t), (65)\nand adopt the quasi-classical basis in which we computed\nthe IPR (see Section IVB). For large times t \u00c0 tc it\nis reasonable to assume that the relative phases of the\nwavefunction expansion coefficients \u03c8n and \u03c8\u2032n in this\nbasis are completely randomized. Assuming furthermore\n|\u03c8n|2 \u2248 |\u03c8\u2032n|2, we find that tr \u03c12(t) asymptotically ap-\nproaches the IPR as defined in Eq. (53). The terms of\ngroup (ii) are therefore associated to the eventual satu-\nration of the purity at the inverse of the effective Hilbert\nspace dimension. We hence arrive at our main result for\nthe purity,\ntr \u03c12(t) \u2248 D2(t, 0) + IPR(t). (66)\nThe initial and intermediate decay of the purity is\ngiven by the first term, which is simply the square of the\ndecoherence function D(t, 0). For stationary noise the\ninitial decay is thus exponential, tr \u03c12(t) = exp(\u22122t\/tc).\nA similar behavior is predicted for Le\u00b4vy noise with \u03b1 > 1,\nfor which tc replaced by \u03c4tc. For nonstationary noise\nwith \u03b1 < 1, Eq. (41) predicts that the initial and in-\ntermediate decay shows the functional features of the\n13\n0.001\n0.01\n0.1\n1\n 0.001  0.01  0.1  1  10  100\ntr\n \u03c1\n2\nt\/t*\n\u03b1=0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n\u03b1=2, 1.2, 1, 0.9\n\u03ba=1\/300\nFIG. 7: (color online).

(66) (dashed curves)\nsquared Mittag-Leffler function, i.e., a stretched expo-\nnential which for later times crosses over to a power law\nwith exponent \u22122\u03b1.\nThe long time behavior of the purity is given by the\nsaturation at the inverse effective Hilbert space dimen-\nsion, which we estimate in terms of the inverse participa-\ntion ratio. According to Eqs. (58) and (59), this term is\nproportional to [var p(t)]\u22121\/2. For \u03b1 > 1 the exponential\ndecay therefore asymptotically crosses over to a power-\nlaw decay with exponent \u22121\/2. As discussed before, for\n\u03b1 < 1, D2(t) itself already crosses over from a stretched\nexponential to a power law with exponent \u22122\u03b1. As a con-\nsequence of the subdiffusive momentum spreading, this\nintermediate power law is asymptotically replaced by a\nslower power law with exponent \u2212\u03b1\/2.\nAs a function of the inverse random time N (0, t), the\ncrossover to the asymptotic power-law of the saturation\nbackground sets in at N (0, t) \u2248 tc ln t\u2217. For \u03b1 > 1, this\ncondition translates into a well-defined crossover time t \u2248\n\u03c4tc ln t\u2217. For \u03b1 < 1, however, the nonergodicity of Le\u00b4vy\nnoise entails that the crossover is blurred.\nThe numerical results presented in Fig. 7 confirm the\nquantitative and qualitative predictions of Eq. (66) for\nthe purity of the Le\u00b4vy kicked rotator. For \u03b1 > 1 the\ninitial decay is exponential and the asymptotic decay is\nalgebraic with exponent \u22121\/2. The background contri-\nbution is here clearly visible and displays the predicted\npower-law decay. For \u03b1 < 1 the decay is a stretched expo-\nnential which crosses over to an algebraic decay with ex-\nponent \u22122\u03b1.

The results of numerical simula-\ntions (solid curves) are compared to the theoretical predic-\ntions from Eq. (68) (dashed curves), which does not account\nfor the saturation background.\nB. Averaged logarithm of the fidelity\nFor a system with complex quantum dynamics such\nas the kicked rotator, it is often observed that the fi-\ndelity fluctuates significantly from realization to realiza-\ntion [34], and from Fig. 7 it is clear that this tendency\nis exacerbated for nonergodic noise. These fluctuations\nare suppressed when one instead considers the averaged\nlogarithm lnF(t) of the fidelity.\nBy passing from the fidelity to its logarithm, the multi-\nplicative suppression of coherence per noise event is con-\nverted into additive contributions. For initial and inter-\nmediate times, the averaged logarithm hence probes the\nmean number of noise events in both noise realizations,\nN (0, t) +N \u2032(0, t) = 2\n\u222b t\n0\nf(t\u2032) dt\u2032, (67)\nwhere f(t) is the sprinkling distribution. This leads to\nthe prediction\nlnF(t) = \u2212 2\ntc\n\u222b t\n0\nf(t\u2032) dt\u2032 (short and intermediate times),\n(68)\nwhile asymptotically a saturation background should set\nin (we do not give an estimate of this background).\nThe validity of this prediction is confirmed by the nu-\nmerical results in Fig. 8, which shows the averaged loga-\nrithm in a representation that makes it readily compara-\nble to the results for the purity (Fig. 7). There is good\nagreement for small and intermediate time, until satura-\ntion sets in, which is not incorporated in Eq. (68). Two\nnoteworthy observations in the comparison to the purity\nare first the inequality exp(lnF) < tr \u03c12, and secondly\nthe fact that the statistical fluctuations are now distinc-\ntively suppressed. This indicates that the logarithm of\nthe fidelity probes typical noise realizations, while the\n14\npurity is influenced by rare noise realizations in which\ncoherence is exceptionally well preserved.\nVI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\nIn this concluding section, we would like to situate our\nwork in the general context of the study of anomalous\ndiffusion and nonexponential relaxation. The investiga-\ntion of diffusion in complex environments enjoys a long\nhistory starting with the seminal work of Scher and Mon-\ntroll on dispersive transport in amorphous semiconduc-\ntors [36]. Subsequently, extensive work on non-Brownian\nmotion and nonexponential decay induced by Le\u00b4vy noise\nin space and\/or in time in classical systems has been\ncarried out, most prominently using the powerful Con-\ntinuous Time Random Walk (CTRW) formalism (for a\nreview see Ref. [37]). In the last few years, this line of re-\nsearch has been extended to quantum systems. The novel\naspect of these developments is the possibility to study\nthe interplay of complex dynamics and quantum phenom-\nena. Thus the interaction with a composite environment\nwith extra degrees of freedom, and the entanglement of\nthe quantum system with the latter, has for instance be\nshown to lead to power-law decay [38]. The relaxation\nof a quantum two-level system subjected to stationary\nand nonstationary power-law noise has been respectively\nexamined in Refs. [39] and [40]. In the latter work, the\npresence of aging dephasing has been demonstrated. Ad-\nditionally, anomalous fast decoherence induced by spatial\nLe\u00b4vy noise, stemming from a chaotic random-matrix en-\nvironment, has been investigated in Ref. [41].\nOur approach in the present work has been to use\nthe quantum kicked rotator as a powerful tool to ex-\nplore decoherence and its interplay with complex quan-\ntum dynamics, in particular, nonstationarity. The latter\nproperty is well-known from the physics of disordered or\nglassy materials [42]. Taking advantage of the unique de-\ngree of tunability of the atom-optical realization of the\nkicked rotator, we have put forward a way to engineer a\ncomplex reservoir, providing full control over the station-\narity of the environment or the absence thereof. Specif-\nically, we have proposed to simulate the coupling to a\ncomplex reservoir with the help of Le\u00b4vy noise with vari-\nable exponent. In this manner, we extend usual quantum\nreservoir engineering in the spirit of the early studies of\nanomalous diffusion in complex media based on the ran-\ndom walk concept. The renewal process that we inves-\ntigate can actually be regarded as corresponding to a\nCTRW with power-law waiting time, but with a renor-\nmalized diffusion range given by the localization length\nof the kicked rotator.\nAt this point, it is appropriate to mention that anom-\nalous diffusion has been shown before to occur in quan-\ntum kicked rotators subjected to deterministic aperiodic\nkicking. More precisely, subballistic wave packet spread-\ning induced by quasiperiodic Fibonacci kick sequences\nhas been established both away and at resonance [43, 44].\nThe effect of Le\u00b4vy noise at resonance has also been the\nsubject of a recent study [45]. An important difference\nto the present study is the fact that these studies do not\nconsider the simultaneous presence of the periodic kicks\nin the intervals between the noise events. As a conse-\nquence, the classical momentum dynamics for the qua-\nsiperiodically kicked systems is subdiffusive, and hence\ndoes not differ qualitatively from the quantum dynam-\nics. The protocol proposed in the present paper stipu-\nlates the presence of such periodic kicks, which induce\ndiffusive classical momentum dynamics, while quantum\nmechanically they drive the system towards localization.\nThe ensuing qualitative difference between the noiseless\nquantum and classical dynamics indeed provides the ter-\nrain in which we explore the consequences of decoherence.\nThe theory of decoherence that we have developed in\nthis paper combines the properties of Le\u00b4vy noise, encoded\nin the generating function of the number of noisy events\n(14), and a random-phase approximation, which exploits\nthe complex quantum dynamics of the rotator appearing\nin the quasienergy transition amplitudes (30). It is worth\nemphasizing that it is nonperturbative (with respect to\ntime) and applies both to stationary and nonstationary\nnoise.\nOne of the central results of our paper, contained in Eq.\n(41), is the demonstration of a regime of nonexponential\nloss of phase coherence when the noise is nonstationary\n(Le\u00b4vy exponent \u03b1 < 1). This regime is characterized by\nan infinite coherence time, indicating that classical be-\nhavior can never be attained, even though the amplitude\nof the noise is dramatically increased by several orders\nof magnitude. This remarkable property finds its origin\nin the divergence of the mean waiting time between ran-\ndom kicks and hence in the absence of a characteristic\ntime scale in the engineered reservoir.\nThe existence of a regime of slow decoherence has di-\nrect consequence for experimentally accessible physical\nquantities of the kicked rotator. We have first shown\nthat the momentum spreading (52) is subdiffusive and\nthat the momentum profile retains a double-sided ex-\nponential shape, see Fig. 3. These asymptotic features\nare in stark contrast to those in the usual decoherence\nregime, here realized for Le\u00b4vy exponent \u03b1 > 1, which is\ncharacterized by normal diffusion and a Gaussian pro-\nfile. The momentum distribution is routinely measured\nin kicked rotator experiments. In the atom-optical exper-\niments [6, 7], the variance of the momentum is accessible\nup to times of the order of ten break times t\u2217, indicat-\ning that the subdiffusive dynamics depicted in Fig. 5 is\nmeasurable with current setups.\nTwo other important quantities that we have consid-\nered are the fidelity and the purity (or average fidelity),\nwhich are more traditional quantities for the character-\nization of decoherence. Here again we have found clear\nsignatures of the nonexponential decoherence regime. In\nEq. (66) we have established a direct connection between\nthe purity on the one hand and the decoherence factor\nand the inverse participation on the other. As a conse-\n15\nquence, we could show that for \u03b1 < 1 the decay of the pu-\nrity evolves from a stretched exponential to an algebraic\ndecay, while \u03b1 > 1 the decay changes from exponential to\nalgebraic with exponent \u22121\/2 (see Fig. 8). The fidelity\ncan be directly measured in echo experiments, see for ex-\nample Ref. [40], and various measurement schemes have\nbeen proposed for kicked rotator experiments [26\u201328].\nWe also mention that we have found a direct relation-\nship (68) between the averaged logarithm of the fidelity\nand the sprinkling distribution of the renewal process.\nOur concluding message is that reservoir engineering\ncan be extended to mimic the coupling to complex non-\nstationary environments, allowing to control in a precise\nmanner the loss of phase coherence and reveal hitherto\nunexplored decoherence scenarios.\nThis work was supported by the European Commis-\nsion, Marie Curie Excellence Grant MEXT-CT-2005-\n023778 (Nanoelectrophotonics), the Emmy Noether pro-\ngram of the DFG, contract LU1382\/1-1, and the cluster\nof excellence Nanosystems Initiative Munich (NIM).\n[1] W.
