Introduction\n[2] The Irish Sea is a semienclosed sea bounded by\nEngland, Wales and southern Scotland to the east and\nIreland to the west (Figure 1). It is heavily utilized and\nsupports commercially important fisheries and a thriving\nleisure industry. It receives freshwater from a 43,000 km2\ncatchment area [Bowden, 1980], which includes several\nlarge industrial centers. In addition to chemical waste there\nhas been concern that high concentrations of nutrients in\nriver and effluent waters could have a major impact on local\necosystems [Gowen et al., 2000]. The discharge of low-\nlevel nuclear waste from the British Nuclear Fuels Limited\nreprocessing plant at Sellafield is also of continuing concern\n[Copplestone et al., 2004]. As a result of these activities, the\nIrish Sea is a region of great interest and has been exten-\nsively studied over the years and a broad picture of the\ndominant hydrodynamic characteristics has been developed.\n[3] While previous studies (discussed below) provide a\ngood picture of the mean structure and characteristics of the\nIrish Sea, the variability on interannual timescales is poorly\ndescribed. Studies of longer-term variability have been\nlimited to climate studies of adjacent shelf waters and the\nnortheast Atlantic, using general circulation models\n(GCMs) such as HadCM3 [e.g., Sheppard, 2004]. However,\nthese models have an inadequate resolution for this region\n(for example, HadCM3 has a resolution of 1.25\u0001 by 1.25\u0001)\nso are unable to resolve many of the features of interest in\nthe shelf seas such as regions of seasonal stratification and\nassociated fronts. Moreover climate models often do not\ninclude some of the dominant physical processes such as\ntidal mixing and the benthic boundary layer. The aim of this\nwork is to assess the performance of a fine-resolution\nregional model of the Irish Sea over a 40 year period,\n1960\u20131999, and to use the model to examine the details of\nthe seasonal and interannual variability of temperature and\nsalinity.\n[4] The hydrodynamics of the Irish Sea are dominated by\nthe semidiurnal tide with tidal currents in most of the region\nof the order 1 m s\u00011. This ensures that much of the Irish Sea\nremains vertically well mixed throughout the year, with\nonly sporadic stratification, for example in Liverpool Bay\n[Sharples and Simpson, 1995]. In contrast, to the west of the\nIsle of Man is a region of relatively deep water (>100 m)\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 112, C01008, doi:10.1029\/2005JC003386, 2007\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory, Liverpool, UK.\n2Now at British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, UK.\nCopyright 2007 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/07\/2005JC003386$09.00\nC01008 1 of 18\nand tidal currents less than 0.3 m s\u00011. The combination of\nweak tides and deep bathymetry allows the western Irish\nSea to stratify in spring and summer, since there is insuf-\nficient tidally generated turbulent energy to maintain mixing\nagainst the input of surface buoyancy through solar heating\n[Simpson, 1971; Simpson and Hunter, 1974]. Beneath the\nseasonal thermocline is a dome-shaped mass of cold, relict\nwinter water that is left trapped and comparatively isolated\nafter the onset of summer stratification. Associated with the\nmargins of the dense bottom water pool are localized but\nintense baroclinic flows forming a midwater cyclonic gyre\nwith along-front flows typically \u00020.2 m s\u00011 [Horsburgh et\nal., 2000]. A similar flow has also been identified at the\nCeltic Sea front [Horsburgh et al., 1998].\n[5] Underlying these seasonal flows, observational work\nhas suggested that, on timescales exceeding several months,\nthere is a net northward flow out of the Irish Sea through the\nNorth Channel [e.g., Howarth, 1982; Brown and\nGmitrowicz, 1995; Leonard et al., 1997]. Modeling studies\nhave suggested that tidal residuals contribute about 0.02 Sv\n(1 Sv = 1 \u0003 106 m3 s\u00011) to this northward flux [Pingree and\nGriffiths, 1980; Proctor, 1981; Young et al., 2000]. In\naddition to this, the low-frequency nontidal flow is gener-\nally northward but is highly sensitive to the magnitude and\ndirection of winds over the shelf [Howarth, 1982; Brown\nand Gmitrowicz, 1995; Knight and Howarth, 1999], as is\nthe proportioning of water flowing to the east and west of\nthe Isle of Man [Young et al., 2001].\n[6] To illustrate the salinity distribution typically ob-\nserved in the Irish Sea, Figure 2 shows the initial salinity\nfield used in the model simulations (see caption for a\ndescription of its derivation). The horizontal gradients in\nsalinity drive an estuarine-like residual circulation in the\neastern Irish Sea [Heaps, 1972; Czitrom, 1986], and vertical\ngradients in tidal displacement allow stratification to develop\nnear freshwater sources inshore, such as Liverpool Bay\n[Sharples and Simpson, 1995]. Detailed cruise data indicate\na sharp transition between the fresher coastal waters (salin-\nity \u000230 practical salinity units (psu)) and more saline Irish\nSea waters (salinity \u000234.2 psu [e.g., Jones and Folkard,\n1971]), with the frontal location determined by climatic\ninfluences such as river discharge and the strength and\nsalinity of Celtic Sea inflows [Evans et al., 2003]. In the\nwestern Irish Sea, although salinity contributes to the early\ndevelopment of stratification near the Irish coast, once\ntemperature stratification is developed salinity plays a\nrelatively minor role [Horsburgh et al., 2000].\n[7] To investigate the variability of temperature and\nsalinity over a 40 year period we use a high-resolution\nregional model in conjunction with a range of observations.\nSuch a simulation is inevitably highly dependent on its\nforcing (surface and lateral boundary conditions) and to\naddress this we have gathered the best data sets available to\nus at the time; one of the objectives of this work is to assess\nthis forcing and how it might be improved in the future.\n[8] In the next section the model used for this study is\ndescribed along with details of the required forcing data. In\nsection 3 the results of the model-data comparisons are\npresented and the modeled seasonal and interannual vari-\nability is discussed. Section 4 considers the long-term\nvariability in the temperature stratification in the western\nIrish Sea. Finally, the results and conclusions are summa-\nrized in section 5.\n2. Model Description\n[9] We use the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory\nCoastal Ocean Modeling System (POLCOMS). This is a\nthree-dimensional finite difference primitive equation model\n(described by Holt and James [2001]) formulated in spher-\nical coordinates on an Arakawa [1972] B grid with a terrain\nfollowing sigma coordinate system in the vertical (for this\napplication). Key aspects of the numerical scheme include:\ncalculation of vertical diffusivities for momentum and\nscalars using a Mellor-Yamada-Galperin level 2.5 turbu-\nlence closure scheme; calculation of horizontal pressure\ngradients by interpolation onto horizontal planes, which\nsignificantly reduces the numerical errors commonly found\nover steep topography in sigma coordinate models; and use\nof the \u2018\u2018piecewise parabolic method\u2019\u2019 (PPM) [James, 1996]\nfor the advection of state variables, which is a conservative\nscheme that minimizes numerical diffusion and has excel-\nlent front preserving properties. The ability of this model to\nreproduce the observed barotropic and baroclinic variability\non the northwest European shelf has been demonstrated in a\nrange of applications, including Proctor and James [1996],\nHolt and James [2001], Holt et al. [2001] and Holt and\nProctor [2003].\n[10] In this study, the model grid has a horizontal reso-\nlution of 1\/20\u0001 longitude by 1\/30\u0001 latitude (\u00023.5 km), and\nhas 25 s layers in the vertical evenly distributed throughout\nthe water column. The model bathymetry is derived from a\nfine-resolution (approximately 1 km) bathymetry digitized\nfrom Admiralty Fair Sheets (where available) and Admiralty\nCharts supplied by the U.K. Hydrographic Office [Brown et\nal., 1999].\n[11] The initial temperature field is from a winter clima-\ntology of the northwest European shelf (using Advanced\nHigh Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite observa-\ntions; 1995\u20131997 data, following Holt and Proctor [2003];\na short period is used since this is unlikely to have much\nimpact beyond the first model year). The initial salinity field\nis derived from climatological, winter salinity distributions\nof ICES data (Figure 2; G. Tattersall, Centre for Environ-\nment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS), personal\ncommunication, 2003). At the open boundary, the model\nuses elevations and depth mean currents for 15 tidal con-\nstituents interpolated from an analysis of the POL Atlantic\nMargin model (see http:\/\/www.metoffice.gov.uk\/research\/\nncof\/shelf\/index.html). Hourly residual elevations and cur-\nrents, which represent the far field forcing, are taken from a\nsimulation of the POL storm surge model [Flather et al.,\n1991] for the 1960\u20131999 period. We use 6 hourly atmo-\nspheric pressures and surface winds interpolated from the\nNorwegian Meteorological office (DNMI) data, the same\ndata set as used by the storm surge model, so ensuring\nconsistency with the residual elevations and currents im-\nposed at the open boundary. Spatially and temporally\nvarying air temperature, relative humidity and cloud cover\nare interpolated from 6 hourly data provided by the National\nCentre for Environmental Prediction (NCEP, http:\/\/\nwww.cdc.noaa.gov\/) [Kalnay et al., 1996]. Surface heat\nfluxes are then calculated using the bulk formulae discussed\nC01008 YOUNG AND HOLT: IRISH SEA TEMPERATURE AND SALINITY\n2 of 18\nC01008\nby Gill [1982]. Short-wave solar radiation is calculated from\nequations describing the dependence of solar radiation on\nthe position of the sun, adjusted for cloud cover (as\ndescribed by Luyten et al. [1999]).\n[12] Daily data from a 1998\u20132002 simulation of the POL\nAtlantic Margin model is averaged to provide a mean\nannual cycle of temperature and salinity along the model\nopen boundaries. This model is in turn forced by ECMWF\natmospheric data, flow data from 38 major rivers and\noceanic data from the UK Met Office\u2019s 1\/3\u0001 Forecast Ocean\nAssimilation Model (FOAM) [Bell et al., 2000]. The\nboundary condition temperature and salinity data are used\nin an upwind advective boundary condition that employs\nthe imposed currents to update temperature and salinity at\nthe open boundary grid cells. Although the use of boundary\ncondition data from a short period is not ideal, there are\ninsufficient observations available from which to derive\nspatially and temporally varying boundary forcing for the\nmodel. The potential impact of the representation of the\nopen boundary salinity and temperature on model results is\ndiscussed in section 3.\n[13] To accurately simulate the salinity it is important to\nadequately represent freshwater inputs from precipitation\nand river flows. There are insufficient long-term rainfall\ndata to derive spatially varying precipitation fields for the\nforty year hindcast simulation. Instead daily precipitation\nrates are estimated by averaging the available data (held at\nthe British Atmospheric Data Centre) from 10 sites around\nthe Irish Sea coast (sites a\u2013j, Figure 1) to produce a single\ntime series. Evaporation rates are calculated using the\nevaporative loss term of the bulk heat flux formulae.\nPrevious applications of POLCOMS to the northwest\nEuropean shelf region have used daily discharge data from\na small number (36) of European rivers to provide the\nriverine inputs [e.g., Holt and James, 2001]. While this\nprovides a first estimate of river discharge it is not adequate\nfor accurately modeling the salinity in the Irish Sea and here\nwe use the dense network of gauging stations (currently\naround 1400) around Britain. However, the density of these\nstations varies considerably from region to region with\nrelatively few stations in remote (e.g., western Scotland)\nor technically more challenging areas (e.g., in the flat terrain\nof East Anglia). Thus direct measurements account for only\naround 65% of the outflow from Great Britain [Marsh and\nSanderson, 2003]. To obtain a more accurate representation\nof freshwater flows, some estimate of the contribution from\nthe ungauged areas is required, including consideration of\nmajor rivers in ungauged basins, minor streams draining\ndirectly to the sea, groundwater outflows, and in a few areas\n(e.g., the Thames estuary) sewage effluent. Researchers at\nthe Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH), Wallingford,\nhave developed an adjustment technique based on the\nobserved association between river flow and catchment size\n[Marsh and Sanderson, 2003]. In summary, the method\nrequires the identification of basic areal units (hydrometric\nareas) for which outflows need to be aggregated; 83 are\nneeded for this model domain. For each of these, represen-\ntative index catchments are identified and weighting factors\nare derived to allow for those outflows that are not mea-\nsured. These take the initial first-order estimates of runoff\nbased on catchment size and further refine them by weight-\ning according to a relation between mean runoff from the\ngauged and ungauged areas. The resulting weighting factors\nare used as multipliers for the gauged river data. Daily data\nfor the full 40 year period are not available for all the\ngauged rivers, so a mean annual cycle is calculated for each\ngauged river from the available data and this is used to fill\nany gaps. The data set as a whole is about 76% complete,\nwith about 93% coverage after 1980.\n[14] The model simulation is conducted for the period\n1960\u20131999 and the ability of the model to accurately\nreproduce the long-term variability of temperature and\nsalinity is assessed by comparison with observational data.\nFor evaluation of model performance, an extensive data set\nof conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) observations col-\nlected in the modeled region (Figure 1). Over this period has\nbeen obtained from the British Oceanographic Data Centre\n(BODC), amounting to 3397 CTD profiles. In addition,\nsince 1954 data have been collected by the Port Erin Marine\nFigure 1. Map illustrating model bathymetry (depths in\nmeters) and locations referred to in the text. CS is Cypris\nstation; S is Sellafield; and a to j are locations of rainfall\ndata.\nC01008 YOUNG AND HOLT: IRISH SEA TEMPERATURE AND SALINITY\n3 of 18\nC01008\nLaboratory (PEML; Liverpool University) at a fixed sam-\npling point (Cypris station) approximately 5 km off the\nsouthwest coast of the Isle of Man (Figure 1). These data\ncomprise samples at 5 m intervals through the water\ncolumn, taken at fortnightly intervals, and analyzed for\nphysical parameters, nutrients, and chlorophyll; these are a\nhighly valuable resource for understanding long-term\nchanges in this region.\n[15] In addition to an overall assessment of model accu-\nracy, available CTD data are used to investigate any long-\nterm drift in model errors over the 40 year simulation, and\nthe geographical distribution of these errors. Unlike many\nother simulations this model does not relax salinity to a\nseasonal climatology. As demonstrated below we find a\nconsistent tendency to overestimate the (absolute) salinity,\nso in addition to the standard model run we conduct a series\nof model experiments aimed at identifying the causes of\nthis: (1) an experiment without surface salinity forcing,\n(2) an experiment with no boundary residual currents or\nelevations, and (3) an experiment with increased (doubled)\nriver discharges.\n3. Temperature and Salinity Results\n3.1. Temperature\n[16] The comparison of observed and modeled temper-\natures for the period 1960\u20131999 is shown in Figure 3 (3397\nCTD profiles) with a summary of the statistics given in\nTable 1. Here, for each observed value a modeled temper-\nature was extracted from the daily mean fields at the vertical\nlevel whose depth range included that of the observed value.\nThe model accurately reproduces the observed temperatures\nthroughout the model\u2019s domain over the 40 year period with\noverall mean and RMS errors of \u00010.01\u0001C and 0.78\u0001C,\nrespectively. The spatial distribution of model errors\n(Figures 3a and 3b) shows no obvious pattern; in particular\nshallow regions do not show a substantial increase in error as\nmight be expected from a significant inaccuracy in the heat\nflux calculation; there is no significant correlation between\nwater depth and mean or RMS error. The temporal variabil-\nity in model errors (not shown) demonstrates no obvious\ndrift in model accuracy over the 40 year period.\n[17] As a more detailed assessment of the model\u2019s ability\nto reproduce long-term variability, Figure 4 shows a com-\nparison of modeled (daily mean) and observed near-surface\ntemperatures at Cypris station; the latter observations in-\nclude sea surface temperatures (SST) derived from AVHRR\nsatellite measurements. It can be seen that the model suc-\nceeds in simulating the observed seasonal and interannual\nvariability at Cypris station, with a slight tendency to under-\npredict the observed winter temperatures (\u00020.5\u0001C). The\nCypris station is located in a well-mixed region thus these\nresults are representative of the whole water column. A\ncomparison of modeled and observed spectra of monthly\nmean temperature at Cypris Station (Figure 5) clearly\nillustrates the ability of the model to reproduce observed\ntemperature variability over intra and interannual timescales.\nThere is close agreement between the two spectra for periods\nup to\u000220 years. However, at longer periods the model tends\nto underpredict the variability. Also shown on Figure 5 is the\ncorrelation between monthly mean modeled and observed\ntemperatures after both have been low-pass filtered for a\nrange of cutoff periods (from 0.3 to 20 years). It is evident\nfor the whole range of cutoff periods (from intra-annual to\ninterannual and decadal) that the model and observations are\nwell correlated. There is some variation though, notably a\ndrop in correlation once the annual cycle has been filtered\nout, indicating that this is the most accurately modeled\nfrequency. The correlation then gradually increases indicat-\ning that the trend is more accurately modeled than variability\non 2\u201310 year scales.\n[18] These results demonstrate that the regional-scale\nmodel is able to reproduce the long-term variability in\ntemperatures in the Irish Sea. We now investigate in further\nFigure 2. Salinity initial condition (psu) derived from\nDecember\u2013March ICES data for 1960\u20132000 (G. Tattersall,\nCEFAS, personal communication, 2003).

Figure 6 shows the variation of\nsummer and winter mean temperature anomalies in the\nmodel and the Cypris station observations. Linear warming\ntrends are given in Table 2 for Cypris station and the four\nregions (A, B, C and D) shown in Figure 2. This shows\nthere is statistically significant warming of the summer\nmonths in all regions, amounting to \u00020.4\u0001C during these\nforty years. The warming in winter is typically much\nsmaller to the extent that it is generally of similar order to\nthe uncertainty in the calculation, the only exception being\nin region A (eastern Irish Sea) where it is similar to the\nsummer warming. This pattern of summer warming being\nsubstantially greater than winter is repeated at Cypris station\nin both model and observations, and the difference between\nthe two is similar to the uncertainties quoted for the regional\nmean values. In winter, the linear warming trend scales\napproximately inversely with the mean water depth of the\nregions, indicating that it results from a change in heat flux.\nIn summer, this is less obvious as regions A, B and C all\nheat at approximately the same rate despite region A being\nsubstantially shallower than B, which also remains well\nmixed. This deserves further investigation through a de-\ntailed analysis of how the terms in the heat flux equation\nvary over this period, which is beyond the scope of the\npresent work. It is interesting to note that of all the long-\nterm time series around the European shelf examined in the\nNOWESP project [Visser et al., 1996] the Cypris station\ndata shows arguably the most obvious long-term warming\nTable 1.

This is to be expected as the flushing time of the\nIrish Sea is typically 1\u20132 yrs (Department for Environment,\nFood, and Rural Affairs, Quality status report of the marine\nand coastal areas of the Irish Sea and Bristol Channel 2000,\nchapter 2: Geography and physical oceanography, http:\/\/\nwww.defra.gov.uk\/environment\/water\/marine\/uk\/science\/\nirishbristol\/03.htm), which is considerably longer than the\nresponse to seasonally varying meteorological forcing. Holt\nand Proctor [2003] demonstrate that horizontal temperature\nadvection cannot be neglected within the Irish Sea, but also\nthat it has a comparatively minor influence in the Celtic Sea\nand on the Malin shelf. However, the fixed annual cycle\nboundary conditions may explain why region D (southern\nIrish Sea and Celtic Sea) shows the lowest warming trend of\nall the regions.\n3.2. Salinity\n[20] The comparison of observed and modeled salinity is\nshown in Figure 7 with a summary of the statistics given in\nTable 1. With overall mean and RMS errors in salinity of\n0.79 psu and 0.98 psu, respectively, it can be seen that the\nmodel does not reproduce the observed salinities as accu-\nrately (in fractional terms) as the temperatures and is\nconsistently too saline. As with temperatures, there is no\nsignificant drift in model predictions over the 40 year period\nwhich is particularly promising given that the model does\nnot relax to climatology. The spatial distribution of salinity\nerrors shows the salinity is uniformly overestimated across\nthis region and that the largest errors occur in the coastal\nTable 2.

Exam-\nining the geographical distribution of errors, it is found that\nthe maximum errors occurred around the Scottish islands, in\nparticular the Clyde Sea and associated lochs, the Bristol\nChannel and the eastern Irish Sea. The largest errors can be\ngrouped as illustrated in Figure 7c, where each group\ncorresponds to a particular year. The largest errors in the\neastern Irish Sea occurred in 1986 (22\u201326 August; group 1),\nalong with some of the largest errors around Scotland. All\nobservations in the Bristol Channel are from a single\nlocation in 1995 (group 2a) and 1996 (group 2b), and all\nshow large errors.\n[21] It is not surprising that the seas around Scotland, and\nin particular the Clyde Sea, are not so well modeled, owing\nto the complexity of the coastline and bathymetry of the\nfjordic systems found here. There is also added uncertainty\nin the flow weighting due to the limited river gauging in\nScotland. In particular, the hydrometric area that discharges\ninto the western Clyde Sea has no gauging stations and\nflows are entirely constructed from data from neighboring\nareas. However, it is not clear why the period 22\u201326 August\n1986 is particularly poorly modeled. Large uncertainties in\nthe Bristol Channel are unlikely to be due to errors in the\nriver inputs since the southwest of England has a relatively\ndense gauging network. However, inadequate representation\nof the channel coastline and horizontal dispersion by the\n3.5 km grid are likely to adversely affect the model results.\nMoreover this version of POLCOMS does not include a\nwetting and drying algorithm, thus a minimum water depth\nof 10 m is prescribed. In regions of high tidal range and\nshallow depth the salinities will be overestimated, even if\nthe river flux is accurate, because of the increased volume of\n(saline) water in the model. In the Bristol Channel and near\ncoastal regions of the eastern Irish Sea the tidal range\nexceeds 8 m and there are extensive tidal flats. In these\nregions the prescribed depth is significantly deeper than the\nactual bathymetry, and this is likely to be a significant\nsource of error in the salinity. However, this is unlikely to\ndirectly affect the salinity further offshore, so long as the\nwater is well mixed, but is likely to have a significant effect\non the tidal currents [Proctor, 1981].\n[22] A comparison of modeled and observed near-bed\nsalinities at Cypris station is shown in Figure 8 (again these\nresults are representative of the whole water column). The\nhigh-frequency variability in the daily data makes compar-\nison and interpretation difficult, so Figure 8 shows monthly\nmean salinities, with the annual mean overlaid. During the\nfirst 1\u20132 years the modeled salinity rises rapidly from the\ninitial condition and is generally too saline for the rest of\nthe model run. The observations show a general decline in\nsalinity from 1960s\u20131970s and a rise in the 1990s (as noted\nby Evans et al. [2003]); the observed spectra of monthly\nmean salinity (Figure 5) show that interannual variability is\nat least as strong as the seasonal signal in salinity. This long-\nterm (decadal) shift is not seen in the model. However, the\nintra-annual variability is only marginally underestimated\nby the model (overall standard deviations are 0.25 and 0.15\nin observations and model respectively) and many of the\nobserved trends in shorter timescale interannual variability\nare reproduced. The differences in salinity from one year to\nthe next agree in sign for 74% of this period and when they\ndisagree the change is typically smaller than when they\nagree (on average 0.09 psu compared with 0.22 psu when\nthey agree). A comparison of modeled and observed spectra\nof monthly mean salinity (Figure 5) further illustrates this. It\nis evident that on timescales of up to 2\u20133 years, the model\nvariability compares well with that observed, but at longer\ntimescales the model significantly underestimates the vari-\nability. This is born out by the correlation analysis which\nshows a statistically significant correlation (at the 95%\nlevel) between model and observed salinities when they\nare low-pass filtered with a cutoff period less than\n\u00022.7 years. The correlation rapidly decreases for longer\ncutoff periods and is no longer significant. This suggests\nthat, while the model may not reproduce the absolute values\nof observed salinity, it contains the dominant physical\nprocesses for the simulation of salinity variability at intra\nand short-term interannual timescales. It should be born in\nmind that because Cypris station is located at the edge of the\neastern Irish Sea salinity gradient, observations of salinity\nvariability here are particularly dependent on any displace-\nment of this gradient [Evans et al., 2003].\n[23] To investigate the causes of the overestimation of\nsalinity and the poor representation by the model of long-\nterm variability in the observed salinity at Cypris station we\nturn to a number of sensitivity experiments and an analysis\nof the salinity budget in the model. The evolution of the\nvolume averaged salinity of a region, S, is described by\ndS\ndt\n\u00bc 1\nV\nFA \u0001 S QR \u00fe QP\u00f0 \u00de\n\u0001 \u0002\n; FA \u00bc\nZ Z\nu S \u0001 S\u0001 \u0002dz \b ds \u00f01\u00de\nwhere the \u2018\u2018anomaly\u2019\u2019 flux, FA, is integrated through the\nwater column and around the boundary surrounding the\nregion. The three terms in equation (1) (describing\nadvective, riverine (QR) and surface (QP) changes in\nsalinity) have been evaluated (Table 3) for the eastern and\ncentral Irish Sea (regions A and C, Figure 2) for the first two\nmodel years (1960\u20131961). This analyzes the evolution from\nthe initial condition, a period of substantial salinity increase\nin the model at Cypris station. In the eastern Irish Sea\n(region A) it is immediately apparent that there is a close\nbalance between large advective (FA\/V) and freshwater\nfluxes, leaving a small tendency term (dS\/dt). This suggests\nthat any shift in this balance can have a substantial effect on\nthe salinity evolution.\n[24] There are four main influences on the long-term\nsalinity simulation, namely: (1) evaporation-precipitation\n(E-P) balance, (2) freshwater inputs, (3) volume flux\nthrough the Irish Sea, and (4) far field variability in salinity.\n[25] The experiments described in section 2 focus on the\nfirst three of these on the assumption that absolute varia-\ntions in oceanic salinity are comparatively small (this is\ngiven some justification below). Figure 9 shows the effects\nof the three model experiments on surface salinity averaged\nfrom 1980 to 1989. Surface salinity forcing is seen to have a\nsignificant influence; Figure 9b shows that excluding this\nterm increases the surface salinity by between \u00020.2 psu in\nthe southern and northern model regions and \u00020.8 psu in\nthe eastern Irish Sea. Hence the inclusion of E-P has a\nsignificant influence on reducing the general overprediction\nof salinity in the model; this is borne out by the results in\nC01008 YOUNG AND HOLT: IRISH SEA TEMPERATURE AND SALINITY\n9 of 18\nC01008\nFigure 7.

As discussed in section 2,\nprecipitation in the model is temporally varying, but spa-\ntially constant. The effect of neglecting the spatial variabil-\nity of precipitation is not clear, however, it is unlikely to\ngreatly contribute to the variability in salinity on decadal\ntimescales, since these are much longer than the flushing\ntime. The decadal variability in precipitation is reasonably\nwell prescribed in the model simulation through 10 obser-\nvational stations and given that these are coastal stations\nthey would, if anything, tend to overestimate the precipita-\ntion in open seas. Moreover there is no correlation between\nannual mean salinity at Cypris station and the precipitation\ndata. This leaves the possibility of a systematic error in the\nevaporation calculation. However, this would not influence\nthe salinity errors in the Bristol Channel where E-P effects\nare small. Hence it is unlikely that surface salinity forcing is\nthe main source of error in the model salinities.\nTable 3.

Comparison of modeled and observed mean monthly and mean annual near-bed salinities\n(psu) at Cypris station over the period 1960\u20131999.\nC01008 YOUNG AND HOLT: IRISH SEA TEMPERATURE AND SALINITY\n11 of 18\nC01008\n[26] The method used to prescribe riverine inputs to the\nmodel, described in section 2, provides good estimates of\nthe river flux for the temporal periods when gauged river\ndata exists, but errors are introduced by the substitution of\nan annual average cycle when data are unavailable, as\ninterannual variability is then neglected. Simulations using\nonly the average annual cycles (not described here) found\nthe observed salinity at Cypris station is very poorly\nreproduced. Hence the inclusion of the interannual variabil-\nity in river flows has a very significant influence on model\nresults. Results from the simulation with increased river\ninflow allow us to demonstrate the extra fresh water flux\nFigure 9. Surface salinity (psu) average for 1980\u20131989 for (a) standard model run, (b) run without\nsurface salinity fluxes, (c) run without boundary residual currents and elevations, and (d) run with \u00032\nriver inflows.\nC01008 YOUNG AND HOLT: IRISH SEA TEMPERATURE AND SALINITY\n12 of 18\nC01008\nneeded to achieve a more accurate absolute salinity. Dou-\nbling the river inflows (Figure 9d) reduces the salinity by on\naverage 0.32 psu overall and \u00021.0 psu in the eastern Irish\nSea. This is sufficient to account for over prediction of\nsalinities at Cypris station by on average 0.3 psu, but not the\nmean difference seen in the CTD comparison (Table 1).\nHence accuracy of the river forcing is unlikely to be the\nmain source of error.\n[27] Considering now model experiment 2 with no\nboundary residual elevations and currents, the results pre-\nsented in Table 3 demonstrate that the salinity (anomaly)\nflux makes a substantial contribution to the salinity vari-\nability in the central (region C) and eastern (region A) Irish\nSea. As demonstrated by these calculations the residual\ntransport through the Irish Sea region is northward, thus\nwater entering the Irish Sea generally originates from the\nCeltic Sea (although storms can occasionally push water\nfrom the North Channel as far south as Cypris Station).\nWhen boundary residual forcing is not imposed on the\nmodel the volume transport through Irish Sea for 1960\u2013\n1961 (Table 3) is approximately doubled (although still\nwithin the observed range [e.g., Brown and Gmitrowicz,\n1995]). This results in a small (\u00025%) increase in the\nanomaly flux into the eastern Irish Sea, but a fractionally\nlarge increase in the tendency term (dS\/dt; \u000230%). This\nexperiment (Figure 9c) shows a general increase in salinity\nthroughout the domain and demonstrates a significant sen-\nsitivity of the salinity to the volume flux through the Irish\nSea, especially in shallow regions (small V in equation (1)).\nThe anomaly flux in the eastern Irish Sea needs only to be\nreduced by \u000213% to eliminate the tendency term here.\n[28] The increase in volume transport in experiment 2 can\nbe explained by the south to north sea level gradient\nimposed by the boundary condition. This tends to counter-\nact the locally forced northward residual flow, so removing\nthe residual boundary conditions will enhance this flow.\nProctor [1981] noted that the local northward forcing within\nthe Irish Sea ought to produce a substantially greater\nvolume flux than that observed and that this could be\naccounted for by a counteracting large-scale pressure gra-\ndient. This can also be seen in the North Channel as a\nreduction in the intrusion of saline water on the Irish side in\nFigure 9c. The mean south-north sea level difference in the\nboundary condition data for the 1980s is 0.05 m. This is less\nthan the typically observed mean sea level difference across\nthe model domain; a \u00020.10 m drop from Islay (north of the\nnorthern boundary) to Newlyn (south of the southern model\nboundary (D. Blackman, POL, personal communication,\n2005). Hence it is distinctly possible that the overestimation\nof salinity in this model is caused by an underestimation of\nthe north-south sea level gradient and consequent enhanced\nflux through the Irish Sea. In turn this is likely to result from\nusing boundary condition data from a two-dimensional\nmodel that excludes any density effects on sea level.\n[29] A time series of observations for the period 1960\u2013\n1987 from a location in the Celtic Sea, just off the southwest\ntip of England (6.067\u0001W, 50.067\u0001N) can be used to assess\nthe extent to which variability in salinity in the Celtic Sea\naffects that at Cypris station, and hence the likely sensitivity\nof the central Irish Sea salinities to the boundary values. The\nobserved salinity variability at this site is compared with\nthat observed at Cypris station, including consideration of\nthe transport time between the two sites. For the range of\ntemporal lags considered (up to 100 days), the maximum\ncorrelation is only 0.17, suggesting the salinity variability at\nCypris station is not correlated with that in the Celtic Sea.\nMoreover the absolute variability measured in the Celtic Sea\nis substantially less than that at Cypris Station; the overall\nstandard deviation is 0.13 psu compared with 0.24 psu at\nCypris. Hence upstream variation in salinity cannot account\nfor the variability at Cypris station but, as shown, variations\nin salinity flux through the Irish Sea can.\n[30] These results show that, while the model is able to\nreproduce some of the trends in salinity variability over the\n40 year period, it does not simulate the absolute values of\nsalinity to the accuracy obtained for temperature. Larger-\nscale variability and volume flux have a greater influence on\nsalinity than temperature (which is strongly constrained by\natmospheric forcing) within the Irish Sea, and at present\nthese are not represented with sufficient accuracy in this\nmodel. The comparisons with CTD data and the sensitivity\nexperiments suggest a discrepancy of this size could be due\nto boundary conditions, surface and\/or riverine forcing, but\nof these we have least confidence in our representation of\nthe boundary conditions.\n4. Variability in Temperature Stratification\n[31] The seasonal development of stratification in the\nwestern Irish Sea is shown in Figure 10 for 1995. This\nparticular year is chosen because it coincides with a number\nof surveys of this region [Horsburgh et al., 2000]. Temper-\nature stratification is represented here by the surface to bed\ntemperature difference, Td; Figure 10 shows fortnightly\naverages of Td, starting shortly after the onset of seasonal\nstratification (defined by a maximum Td in the western Irish\nSea consistently exceeding 1\u0001C) on approximately 5 April\n1995. Stratification in 1995 breaks down on approximately\n2 October (defined by a maximum Td in the western Irish\nSea consistently below 1\u0001C). Throughout this period strat-\nification is strongest to the southwest of the Isle of Man,\nwith the location of peak Td being nearly constant, varying\nby \u00020.2\u0001 longitude and \u00020.4\u0001 latitude. Starting from a\npatch to the southwest of the Isle of Man, the stratified\nregion gradually extends northward to the North Channel\nwith a persistent weak Td predicted in the North Channel\nfrom the end of May to the end of August. Strong stratifi-\ncation is unable to develop here because of the large tidal\ncurrents. From late May a tongue of strong stratification\ndevelops extending northward to the west of the Isle of Man\nfollowing the orientation of the deep channel (Figure 1).\nWeak stratification gradually extends southward toward St\nGeorge\u2019s Channel but is sufficiently weak for the frontal\nsystems associated with the density structures in the Irish\nand Celtic Seas to remain distinct. The model shows the\nregion of strongest stratification remains constrained to the\ndeep, weak tidal region of the western Irish Sea. Stratifica-\ntion starts to break down at the end of August and has\ndisappeared from the western Irish Sea by October.\n[32] This modeled seasonal cycle of stratification agrees\nwell with the observations described by Horsburgh et al.\n[2000]. The maximum model Td of 6.6\u0001C, on 21 July, is in\ngood agreement, and at an approximately coincident loca-\ntion, with the observed maximum of 6.7\u0001C on 24 July. Both\nC01008 YOUNG AND HOLT: IRISH SEA TEMPERATURE AND SALINITY\n13 of 18\nC01008\nthe distribution and strength of stratification are reproduced\nthroughout July and August, and the timing of the break-\ndown and gradual reduction in geographical extent of\nstratification agree well with the observations.\n[33] Figure 11 shows how the timing of the stratification\ncycle varies throughout the 40 year simulation period. Over\nthis time, the onset of stratification varied by up to a month\n(but without obvious trend), from 31 March in 1991 (Jday\n90) to 30 April in 1966 (Jday 120), with an average start\ndate of 16 April. The geographical pattern of stratification is\nessentially the same from year to year with a maximum Td\nto the southwest of the Isle of Man, extending northward\nfollowing the deep bathymetry. Only minor differences in\nthe maximum extent of the stratification are produced, as\nFigure 10. Seasonal development of stratification in the Irish Sea in 1995, expressed as average surface\nto bed temperature difference.\nC01008 YOUNG AND HOLT: IRISH SEA TEMPERATURE AND SALINITY\n14 of 18\nC01008\nillustrated for the years 1981 and 1995 in Figure 12. Here\n21 July (Jday 202) was the date with maximum Td in both\nyears. It can be seen that although there is significantly\nstronger stratification predicted in 1995, the geographical\nextent of stratification has not changed significantly, with\njust minor extensions of weak Td to the east and south of the\ncentral stratified region. The timing of peak stratification\nvaries by nearly two months, from 7 June in 1980 (Jday\n158) to 6 August in 1994 (Jday 218) (Figure 11), with an\naverage date of 8 July, but with a definite trend for the peak\nstratification to be delayed over the course of these 40 years.\nThe peak surface to bed temperature difference has a mean\nvalue of 5.31\u0001C with a range of over 3\u0001C; a minimum of\n3.56\u0001C occurs in 1962 and a maximum of 6.83\u0001C in 1983.\nThe breakdown of stratification ranged from 4 September in\n1992 (Jday 247) to 7 October in 1968 (Jday 280)\n(Figure 11), with an average date of 23 September. These\nresults suggest that while the location and extent of strati-\nfication in the western Irish Sea is fixed by bathymetry and\ntidal currents, there is a high degree of interannual variabil-\nity in the timing and strength of stratification, dependent on\nthe variability in atmospheric forcing.\n5. Summary\n[34] This paper describes the application of a fine-\nresolution, regional-scale model to the simulation of decadal\nvariability of temperature and salinity in the Irish Sea.\nUnlike many other such simulations this model is run\nwithout relaxation to seasonal climatology and so gives an\naccurate account of the model\u2019s response to the forcing. One\nof the foci of this work is accurately representing the\nsalinity forcing, an area neglected in previous studies on\nthe northwest European Shelf. Comparisons with 3397 CTD\nprofiles over the 40 year simulation period (1960\u20131999)\nshow temperatures to be modeled to a high degree of\naccuracy, with mean and RMS errors of \u00010.01\u0001C and\n0.78\u0001C respectively with little drift or obvious spatial\nvariation. Modeled temperature variability also agrees well\nwith long-term observations at Cypris station, a site to the\nFigure 11.

These results show the\nsummer temperatures in the whole Irish Sea to be warming\nat a rate of \u00020.01\u0001C yr\u00011, and the fact that warming at this\nrate is also observed in the Cypris station time series lends\nweight to this conclusion.\n[35] Salinities are less well reproduced by the model,\nbeing consistently too high after a period of approximately\nthe flushing time of the Irish sea has elapsed. Comparisons\nwith CTD data yield mean and RMS values of 0.79 psu and\n0.98 psu respectively, with salinities consistently overesti-\nmated. The regions with the largest errors are the Bristol\nChannel, the eastern Irish Sea and around the Scottish\nislands, in particular the Clyde Sea. A number of sensitivity\nstudies have been conducted and these suggest that the\nlarge-scale error in absolute salinity is most likely to result\nfrom the boundary condition\u2019s mean sea level effects on the\nvolume flux through the Irish Sea. There may also be a\ncontribution from the surface forcing, but this is likely to be\noverestimating the precipitation (being derived from land-\nbased measurements). Comparisons with the time series of\nsalinity from Cypris station also showed that the model is\ngenerally too saline, but it has some skill in representing\nsalinity variability with periods up to 2 years. However, it\nfails to predict the decadal-scale variability (which is seen\nhere to be of similar magnitude to the seasonal variability),\nthe cause of which has yet to be definitively established.\n[36] Model estimates of the seasonal development and\nbreakdown of stratification in the western Irish Sea in 1995\nagree well with an extensive data set presented by\nHorsburgh et al. [2000]. Strongest stratification occurs in\na region to the southwest of the Isle of Man, with stratifi-\ncation confined to a region of weak tides and deep bathym-\netry in the western Irish Sea, as suggested by theory\n[Simpson and Hunter, 1974]. Over the 40 year simulation\nperiod, the geographical distribution of stratification in the\nwestern Irish Sea varies little. However, there is significant\nvariability in the timing of stratification, with the onset and\nbreakdown varying by up to a month. The date of peak\nstratification varies by up to two months and shows a\nsignificant trend to occur later in the year. In addition, the\nFigure 12. Comparison of surface to bed temperature difference in 1981 and 1995 on the days when\nstratification in the western Irish Sea was a maximum.\nC01008 YOUNG AND HOLT: IRISH SEA TEMPERATURE AND SALINITY\n16 of 18\nC01008\nmaximum surface to bed temperature difference ranged\nfrom 3.56\u0001C in 1962 to 6.83\u0001C in 1983. The fronts\nassociated with the stratification in the western Irish Sea\nform a cyclonic gyre. This provides a physical mechanism\nwhereby the pelagic larvae of the commercially valuable\nNorway lobster, Nephrops norvegicus, are retained close to\nthe muddy substrate they require for settlement [Hill et al.,\n1996]. Variability in the timing of the onset of stratification\nin relation to spawning, and the subsequent strength of the\nflows associated with the bottom density fronts, could affect\nthe retention and recruitment of the larvae.\n[37] In this paper we have demonstrated the value of a\nregional model with limited boundary conditions in further-\ning our understanding of long-term change in shelf seas.\nWhile a number of shortcomings of this approach have been\ndemonstrated, the application of the model to the study of\nlong-term warming and the interannual variability in strat-\nification has clearly demonstrated its value. Coupled hydro-\ndynamic-ecosystem models have become an important tool\nfor the investigation of shelf sea processes, but are usually\nemployed on seasonal timescales. However, many of these\nprocesses act on annual to decadal timescales (e.g., nutrient\ntransport, benthic cycling, ecosystem response to climate\nchange) requiring increasingly long integration times.\nKnowledge of the relative importance of boundary influen-\nces then becomes crucial to keeping the problem tractable.\nSince this study was conducted new atmospheric model data\nsets have become available (particularly ERA40, see\nwww.ecmwf.int\/research\/era\/), and since we have demon-\nstrated the region to be strongly determined by the atmo-\nspheric forcing, investigating the sensitivity to the details of\nthe meteorological forcing would be an obvious next step.\n[38] Acknowledgments.
