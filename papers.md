    <title>Indexing by Latent Semantic Analysis</title>
    <authors>Scott Deerwester, Susan T. Dumais, George W. Furnas, Thomas K. Landauer, Richard Harshman</authors>
    <overview>This seminal paper introduces Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) as a technique to overcome the limitations of keyword matching in information retrieval. The authors describe how singular value decomposition (SVD) can be used to uncover latent semantic structure in term-document matrices, addressing problems of synonymy and polysemy in text retrieval.</overview>
    <relevance>This paper provides the theoretical foundation for the entire LSI academic search engine project. The core indexing engine described in the project directly implements the SVD-based dimensionality reduction (using 150 dimensions) on the term-document matrices, as outlined in this paper. The field-weighted approach in the project extends the basic LSI model.</relevance>

    <title>An Introduction to Latent Semantic Analysis</title>
    <authors>Thomas K. Landauer, Peter W. Foltz, Darrell Laham</authors>
    <overview>This paper explains the theoretical foundations and practical applications of LSA in a more accessible manner. It covers how LSA extracts and represents the contextual-usage meaning of words through statistical computations on large text corpora.</overview>
    <relevance>The paper's explanation of how LSA represents both terms and documents in the same semantic space directly informs the query processing module of the search engine. The project's implementation of cosine similarity for matching queries to documents is based on principles described here.</relevance>

    <title>Using Latent Semantic Analysis to Improve Access to Textual Information</title>
    <authors>Susan T. Dumais, George W. Furnas, Thomas K. Landauer, Scott Deerwester</authors>
    <overview>This paper demonstrates practical applications of LSI in information retrieval systems. It shows how LSI can overcome vocabulary mismatch problems between queries and documents, producing more accurate and comprehensive search results.</overview>
    <relevance>The system architecture of the LSI academic search engine, particularly the document processor and indexing engine components, draws heavily from the practical implementation guidance in this paper. The project's TF-IDF matrices preprocessing step before applying SVD follows the approach described here.</relevance>

    <title>Using Linear Algebra for Intelligent Information Retrieval</title>
    <authors>Michael W. Berry, Susan T. Dumais, Gavin W. O'Brien</authors>
    <overview>This paper provides a comprehensive mathematical treatment of LSI, focusing on the linear algebra aspects. It details SVD implementation, updating procedures for existing LSI databases, and applications of LSI in various contexts.</overview>
    <relevance>The paper's discussion of SVD updating techniques directly informs the incremental indexing capability of the project's indexing engine. The memory-efficient storage using HDF5 addresses some of the computational challenges described in this paper.</relevance>

    <title>Self-supervised Contextual Keyword and Keyphrase Retrieval with Self-Labelling</title>
    <authors>Prafull Sharma, Yingbo Li</authors>
    <overview>This paper presents a novel approach for keyword and keyphrase extraction using BERT-based models and contextual features. It introduces a self-supervised method that doesn't require manual labeling of training data.</overview>
    <relevance>This paper directly relates to the KeyBERT keyword extraction enhancement module in the search engine. The project implements BERT-based semantic representations for extracting key phrases from documents, which follows the approach outlined in this paper.</relevance>

    <title>Document Length Normalization</title>
    <authors>Amit Singhal, Gerard Salton, Mandar Mitra, Chris Buckley</authors>
    <overview>This paper addresses the issue of document length bias in retrieval systems. It introduces pivoted cosine normalization to account for the observation that longer documents tend to have a higher probability of relevance in certain collections.</overview>
    <relevance>The field-weighted TF-IDF matrices in the project's indexing engine (with title weighted 3.0×, abstract 1.5×, full text 1.0×) implement a form of document length normalization that aligns with the principles discussed in this paper.</relevance>

    <authors>D.B. Mirajkar, D.G. Chougule, K.K. Awale, S.B. Sagare</authors>
    <overview>This paper discusses the intersection of information retrieval and semantic web technologies. It explores how traditional IR systems can be adapted to handle semantic web documents and annotations.</overview>
