  "fullText": "Associating object names with descriptions of shape\nthat distinguish possible from impossible objects\nPeter Walker, Sara Dixon, and Diane Smith\nPsychology Department, Lancaster University, UK\nFive experiments examine the proposal that object names are closely linked to\nrepresentations of global, 3D shape by comparing memory for simple line draw-\nings of structurally possible and impossible novel objects. Objects were rendered\nimpossible through local edge violations to global coherence (cf. Schacter,\nCooper, & Delaney, 1990) and supplementary observations confirmed that the\nsets of possible and impossible objects were matched for their distinctiveness.\nEmploying a test of explicit recognition memory, Experiment 1 confirmed that\nthe possible and impossible objects were equally memorable. Experiments 2\u20134\ndemonstrated that adults learn names (single-syllable non-words presented as\ncount nouns, e.g., \u201cThis is a dax\u201d) for possible objects more easily than for impos-\nsible objects, and an item-based analysis showed that this effect was unrelated to\neither the memorability or the distinctiveness of the individual objects. Experi-\nment 3 indicated that the effects of object possibility on name learning were long\nterm (spanning at least 2 months), implying that the cognitive processes being re-\nvealed can support the learning of object names in everyday life. Experiment 5\ndemonstrated that hearing someone else name an object at presentation improves\nrecognition memory for possible objects, but not for impossible objects. Taken\ntogether, the results indicate that object names are closely linked to the descrip-\ntions of global, 3D shape that can be derived for structurally possible objects but\nnot for structurally impossible objects. In addition, the results challenge the view\nthat object decision and explicit recognition necessarily draw on separate mem-\nory systems, with only the former being supported by these descriptions of global\nobject shape. It seems that recognition also can be supported by these descrip-\ntions, provided the original encoding conditions encourage their derivation.\nHearing an object named at encoding appears to be just such a condition. These\nobservations are discussed in relation to the effects of naming in other visual\ntasks, and to the role of visual attention in object identification.\nCorrespondence should be addressed to P. Walker, Department of Psychology, Lancaster\nUniversity, Lancaster LA1 4YF, UK.

For example, does one type of visual object representation have\nprivileged links with object names?\nBasic-level object representations\nThe concept of a basic-level visual representation emphasizes the significance\nof an intermediate level of structural description in object categorization\n(Rosch, Mervis, Gray, Johnson, & Boyes-Braem, 1976). Rosch et al. argue that\nthis level of representation strikes an effective balance between maximizing the\nstructural similarity of objects in the same category and minimizing the similar-\nity of objects in different categories. Object shape is emphasized, rather than\nmaterial and surface qualities, partly because the visual perceptual system is\nefficient at encoding this, but also because shape is a relatively reliable cue to\nobject kind and object function (see, for example, Landau, Smith, & Jones,\n1998). Regarding visual\u2013verbal connections, Rosch et al. provide evidence for\nthe special status of the link between basic-level representations of shape and\nobject labels. They propose that these representations are associated with the\nmost frequently used object names, which also happen to be the simplest object\nlabels, the first to be acquired during development, and the most likely labels to\nbe incorporated in languages with a limited object vocabulary (such, as Ameri-\ncan Sign Language\u2014ASL).\nObject naming and categorization\nThere is other evidence that object names, and count nouns in particular, are\nlinked with visual representations of object shape that can accommodate varia-\ntion in the appearance of an individual object and in the appearance of different\nobjects from the same category (see Landau, 1994; Landau, Smith, & Jones,\n1998, for reviews). When children and adults learn to associate a count noun\nwith a novel object (e.g., \u201cThis is a dax\u201d), they choose to generalize the name to\nother objects (e.g., \u201cWhich of these is a dax also?\u201d) on the basis of object shape\nrather than on the basis of material or surface qualities. The salience of shape in\nthe extension of these object labels does not reflect an indiscriminate bias to\ngroup objects on the basis of shape, even for children, but is specific to situa-\ntions in which count nouns are linked with objects (i.e., when objects are\nnamed). Thus, when objects are grouped in the absence of any object labels\n(e.g., \u201cWhat goes with this?\u201d), the shape bias is less apparent. Indeed, when\nobjects are distinctively textured and the conditions of illumination highlight\nthis, then labelling the objects with an adjective (e.g., \u201cThis is a daxy one\u201d) or a\nsuperordinate label (e.g., \u201cThis is a kind of dax\u201d), can create a situation where\n598 WALKER, DIXON, SMITH\ngeneralization of a verbal label is based on material similarity rather than shape\nsimilarity (see Landau, 1994, for a review of the empirical evidence).\nIn these studies of object naming, object shape is considered to be more\nabstract than a 2D or 3D description that is specific to the conditions under\nwhich an object is viewed (i.e., shape is described in a way that is viewpoint\nindependent). Furthermore, the concept of shape can accommodate the recon-\nfiguration of non-rigid objects, as when a cat changes from a standing to a sit-\nting position, or the lid of a box is opened. Thus, generalization of the name\nassigned to a novel object is not precluded by such reconfigurations of shape\n(see Landau, 1994).\nBiederman (1987) argues that visual object recognition is based on a rela-\ntively abstract and largely viewpoint-independent description of an objects 3D\nshape. (The material and surface properties of objects are considered to contrib-\nute to object recognition only secondarily.) These structural descriptions are\nthought to capture all the primitive volumetric forms (geons) making up an\nobjects overall shape, along with their spatial arrangement framed in object-\nbased coordinates. In his experimental work, Biederman makes extensive use\nof a naming task on the understanding that object naming provides a relatively\npure index of the contribution that these structural descriptions make to object\nrecognition (see, for example, Biederman & Cooper, 1992). He and his col-\nleagues find that priming effects in object naming generalize across variations\nin an objects appearance that result from changes in viewpoint (e.g., changes in\npicture size, spatial location, and angle of view) (see Biederman & Cooper,\n1992; Biederman & Gerhardstein, 1993; Cooper, Biederman, & Hummel,\n1992a).\nStructural possibility and priming in object decision\nA presemantic description of the global, 3D shape of an object has been isolated\nby contrasting peoples responses to pictures of possible and impossible novel\nobjects (see Cooper, 1994; Cooper & Schacter, 1992, for reviews). Again, these\nstructural descriptions are thought of as mental representations of an objects\ncomponent parts and their object-based spatial arrangement, which together\nspecify the objects global, 3D shape (e.g., Schacter et al., 1990). Depicted\nobjects are rendered impossible by arranging for a picture to contain local sur-\nface and edge violations to complete coherence (see Figure 1 for examples of\npossible and impossible objects). In this way, qualitatively different effects\nfrom the two types of picture are attributed to the impact of a global, 3D shape\nrepresentation, since it is the availability of this that distinguishes possible from\nimpossible objects.1\nIt has been observed that priming in an object decision task (deciding\nwhether a novel object is structurally possible or impossible) is confined to pos-\nsible objects. This implies that priming reflects the impact of a description of\nOBJECT SHAPE\u2013NAME LINKS 599\n600\nFigure 1. Examples of line drawings of possible and impossible objects used in the experiments.\nthe global, 3D shape of the priming object.2 Converging evidence for this\ncomes from the observation that such priming is contingent on the picture\nprimes being encoded in a way that emphasizes the depicted objects global\nshape (Schacter & Cooper, 1993; Schacter et al., 1990). That the structural\ndescription is viewpoint independent is indicated by the observation that prim-\ning is equally strong whether study and test pictures depict an object from the\nsame or from different viewpoints (Cooper et al., 1992b). Given its focus on\nstructural information, coupled with its viewpoint invariance, the representa-\ntion supporting object decision priming has been considered by Cooper,\nSchacter, Ballesteros, and Moore (1992b) to be the same representation sup-\nporting priming in Biederman\u2019s object naming task.\nRecognition memory\nThe involvement of structural descriptions in object decision priming is con-\ntrasted with the involvement of quite different visual representations in explicit\nrecognition memory (Cooper & Schacter, 1992). This contrast is evident in the\nstochastic independence of object decision and recognition for studied possible\nobjects (Schacter et al., 1990; Schacter, Cooper, Delaney, Peterson, & Tharan,\n1991a). In addition, a number of manipulations have been observed to influ-\nence explicit recognition, equally for possible and impossible objects, while at\nthe same time having no impact on object decision. These manipulations\ninclude repeating the presentation of picture primes (Schacter et al., 1991a),\nadding functional and associative decisions to the encoding of picture primes\n(Schacter & Cooper, 1993; Schacter et al., 1991a), and introducing study-to-\ntest differences in picture size (Cooper et al., 1992b). Interestingly, Biederman\nand Cooper (1992) also found that study-to-test changes in size affected\nexplicit recognition memory without impacting at all on object naming.\nThis evidence suggests that object naming and object decision both rely on\nthe same representation of object shape, whereas explicit recognition is\nsupported by other representations. However, the nature of these other repre-\nsentations remains largely unspecified. Given the general equivalence of\nrecognition for possible and impossible objects, in terms of absolute levels of\nperformance and sensitivity to a range of manipulations, these other representa-\ntions would appear to be less global than the shape descriptions underlying\nobject naming and object decision. Rather, they appear to preserve information\nabout the more localized visual features incorporated in depictions of possible\nand impossible objects. In addition, of course, they have been shown to pre-\nserve information about size and parity, and are assumed to incorporate visual\ndetails indicative of an objects material and surface qualities (such as colour\nand texture).\nOBJECT SHAPE\u2013NAME LINKS 601\nThe present study\nThese different lines of enquiry suggest that a view-independent visual repre-\nsentation of the global, 3D shape of an object is closely linked with representa-\ntion of its category name. Although comparing memory for pictures of possible\nand impossible objects has served to isolate this form of visual representation in\nthe object decision task, the same comparison has not been made in relation to\nobject naming. The present study is a first attempt to manipulate object possi-\nbility to examine the link between visual representation of global, 3D shape and\nrepresentation of object name. The main task devised for this purpose (Experi-\nments 2\u20134) requires adults to learn nonsense names, in the form of count nouns,\nto pictures of possible and impossible novel objects. It is predicted that object\nnames will be learned more easily to pictures of possible objects than to pic-\ntures of impossible objects. It is assumed that there will be some learning of\nnames for impossible objects, because there are other bases on which picture\u2013\nname associations can be learned, as when people learn names for visual fea-\ntures such as colour. However, the argument is that object names will be\nlearned more easily to pictures of possible objects because support can be\nderived from the normally close links between representations of global, 3D\nobject shape and object names.\nThe present study also examines the impact on recognition memory of hear-\ning an object named at encoding (Experiment 5). More specifically, it tests the\nproposal that global structural possibility can influence recognition memory\nand will do so when objects are named at encoding. Previous research has\nshown that priming, and therefore an effect of object possibility, is not always\nobserved in the object decision task (Schacter et al., 1990). Thus, priming has\nbeen observed when participants have had to indicate whether each priming\nobject faced left or right, but not when they have had to say if it contained more\nvertical or horizontal edges. It would appear that deriving a structural descrip-\ntion of an objects overall shape is not obligatory and is partly determined by the\nencoding instructions. It is possible, therefore, that in previous studies of recog-\nnition memory object possibility has generally failed to have an effect, not\nbecause structural descriptions are incapable of supporting recognition mem-\nory, but because the encoding tasks have not made 3D object shape a salient\nfeature. To test the idea that representations of global, 3D shape and name are\nclosely linked, it is determined if hearing the experimenter name an object at\nencoding with a count noun will ensure that object possibility has an impact on\nrecognition memory.\nEXPERIMENT 1\nBefore determining if verbal labels are more easily learned to pictures of possi-\nble objects than to pictures of impossible objects, it was considered important\n602 WALKER, DIXON, SMITH\nto ensure that there was no effect of object possibility on recognition memory\nfor the pictures themselves. The absence of such an effect would offer reassur-\nance that the two types of picture were matched in terms of their own memora-\nbility. Any effect of object possibility on the ease with which object names are\nlearned could then be related specifically to the shape\u2013name associations.\nIn an incidental memory condition, recognition memory for the pictures was\nexamined when participants had no expectation that their memory for the pic-\ntures would be tested. It was considered that this would minimize the likelihood\nthat verbal recoding and elaboration would be used to facilitate remembering,\non the assumption that these are intentional processes (see, Baddeley, 1990, for\nevidence, reviewed in the context of the working memory framework, that ver-\nbal recoding of to-be-remembered visual items is intentional). In this way, inci-\ndental recognition memory was used as a relatively pure measure of the visual\nmemorability of the pictures. It was expected that object possibility would have\nno effect, confirming the equivalence of the two sets of pictures. In an inten-\ntional memory condition, recognition memory for the pictures was examined\nwhen participants were forewarned that their memory would be assessed. No\nattempt was made to encourage participants to adopt any specific strategies for\nremembering, verbal or otherwise. The inclusion of this condition permitted\ncomparison with previous studies in which object possibility failed to influence\nintentional recognition memory (e.g., Cooper et al., 1992b, Exp. 1; Schacter et\nal., 1991a).\nMethod\nParticipants. Eighty undergraduate students at Lancaster University par-\nticipated in the experiment. Forty students were randomly assigned to the inci-\ndental and intentional memory conditions, with the constraint that the same\nnumber of male (and female) participants took part in each condition.\nMaterials. Twenty-four black-on-white line drawings were created using\nMacromedia Freehand (version 5.0) on a Power Macintosh 8500/120. They\nwere printed on a LaserWriter Pro printer and laminated to form 12.5 \u00d7 9.5cm\ncards. The objects were scaled in the picture so that their maximum dimension,\nhorizontal or vertical, was approximately 6cm, with individual variation per-\nmitted to give the impression the objects were the same size. The twelve possi-\nble objects and four of the impossible objects were based on those illustrated by\nLynn Cooper and Daniel Schacter in their various publications. New pictures of\nimpossible objects were created by one of the authors (PW). Eight of the pic-\ntures are illustrated in Figure 1. A duplicate set of 24 cards was produced for\ntesting recognition memory. Different sets of cards were prepared for the study\nand test phases of the task in order to prevent participants from capitalizing on\nOBJECT SHAPE\u2013NAME LINKS 603\nany distinguishing features in the picture cards themselves (such as a blemish in\nthe lamination or a bent corner).\nDesign. A mixed design was employed, with Memory Condition (inciden-\ntal versus intentional) as a between-participants factor, and Object Possibility\n(possible versus impossible objects) as a within-participants factor.\nPreliminary work revealed that setting the number of to-be-remembered\npictures at 10 yielded intermediate levels of task performance that avoided\nfloor and ceiling. For each trial, therefore, 10 possible and 10 impossible\nobjects were randomly selected from the pool of 24 pictures. From this set of 20\npictures, five possible and five impossible objects were selected at random. A\nrandom order for their presentation was determined, with the constraint that no\nmore than two successive presentations involved the same type of object. Each\nordering for a set of to-be-remembered pictures, as well as the reverse ordering,\nwas used once in each memory condition.\nProcedure. All participants were told that the researchers were interested\nin arithmetic, and specifically in the way that people speeded up across succes-\nsive practice periods. It was explained that they would be required to complete\nas many addition problems as possible in two, 2-minute spells. These were to be\nseparated by a period in which they would be engaged in unrelated activity.\nAfter the first period of arithmetic all participants completed the visual\nmemory task. Those in the incidental condition were told that the experimenter\nwanted them to look at some unrelated material in order to prevent them from\nthinking about, and visualizing, any of the arithmetic problems they had just\ncompleted. They were instructed simply to look at the sequence of pictures, and\nit was explained that after doing so they would undertake a second period of\npaced arithmetic. Participants in the intentional condition were told that the\nexperimenter was also interested in testing their visual memory, and for this\nreason they were being asked to look at a sequence of 10 pictures. They were\ngiven a brief indication of the manner in which their memory would be tested.\nThe experimenter placed the 10 to-be-remembered pictures on a table in\nfront of the participant. A computer metronome synchronized the placement of\nsuccessive cards, on top of each other, at a 2sec rate. After presentation of the\nsequence of to-be-remembered pictures, all 20 pictures selected for that trial\nwere displayed on the table. The sets of possible and impossible objects were\narranged separately, each in two columns of five pictures. Participants were\nrequired to select the five possible and five impossible objects they had just\nseen. They alternated their selections across the two object types, with half the\nparticipants in each condition choosing a possible object first, and half choos-\ning an impossible object first. A second spell at arithmetic did not take place\nand participants completed just one trial.\n604 WALKER, DIXON, SMITH\nAfter completion of the experiment, participants in the incidental memory\ncondition were asked if they had anticipated that their memory for the pictures\nwould be tested. The plan was to replace any participant who did anticipate\nbeing tested, but in the event this was not necessary.\nResults\nTable 1 presents the mean number of possible and impossible objects correctly\nrecognized in the incidental and intentional memory conditions. A 2 (Object\nPossibility) \u00d7 2 (Memory Condition) analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed a\nsignificant effect of memory condition, F(1, 78) = 5.65, p = .02, with more pic-\ntures correctly recognized in the intentional memory condition. Object possi-\nbility failed to have a significant effect on recognition, F(1, 78) = 0.28, p = .60,\nand did not interact significantly with memory condition, F(1, 78) < 1.\nAn item-based analysis was undertaken on the number of participants cor-\nrectly recognizing each of the 24 pictures. Memory condition failed to have a\nsignificant effect, F(1, 44) = 2.24, p = .14. The main effect of object possibility\nand its interaction with memory condition were also insignificant, F(1, 44) =\n.001, p = .98, and F(1, 44) < 1, respectively. That the memorability of the indi-\nvidual pictures had been measured with some reliability was indicated by a sig-\nnificant correlation in item memorability across the incidental and intentional\nmemory conditions, r = .41, p < .05.\nBecause of the importance of the null result regarding object possibility, it\nwas determined if Experiment 1 was powerful enough to provide sufficient\nprotection against a Type II error (see Keppel, Saufley, & Tokunaga, 1992, for\nan explanation of the procedures for relating indices of power, effect size, and\nsample size). If it is assumed that there is an underlying effectof object possibil-\nity of moderate size ( w 2 = .06), then 54 participants would be required to yield\nan acceptable value of .80 for power. In Experiment 5, reported later, explicit\nrecognition memory for the same set of pictures was assessed in the same way\nas in Experiment 1. In one condition, where the pictured objects were named by\nOBJECT SHAPE\u2013NAME LINKS 605\nTABLE 1\nExperiment 1: Mean number of possible\nand impossible objects correctly\nrecognized by a participant as a function of\nthe incidental versus intentional nature of\nremembering\nObject Type\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nMemory Condition Possible Impossible\nIncidental 3.58 3.70\nIntentional 3.98 3.98\nMaximum score = 5, chance = 2.5.\nthe experimenter at encoding, a significant effect of object possibility was\nobserved. Based on the value of F associated with this significant result, the\neffect of object possibility is seen to be very large, w 2 = .25, and if this value is\napplied to Experiment 1, it emerges that 12 participants would be required to\nyield a value for power of .08. In summary, from these considerations of effect\nsize and power, it seems that with 80 participants in Experiment 1 there was\npower to provide sufficient protection against a Type II error. This issue is\nrevisited in the context of Experiment 5, where additional results are combined\nwith those from Experiment 1 to provide an even more powerful test of the null\neffect of object possibility.\nSupplementary observations\nA new group of 15 participants, drawn from the general student population\nat Lancaster University, provided information on the distinctiveness of the 24\nobjects in order to determine if this feature was confounded with object possi-\nbility. They were each given a 132-page booklet containing all possible pair-\nings of objects from the same category (possible and impossible). The black-\non-white line drawings were reproduced exactly as for Experiment 1, and the\npairs of pictures appeared in a random order, except for the constraint that no\nmore than two successive pages involved pictures from the same category. Two\nalternative booklets were prepared, differing with regard to the order in which\nthe picture pairs appeared. To each picture pair participants assigned a rating\nfrom \u20134 (dissimilar) to 4 (similar), on a 9-point scale, indicating the degree to\nwhich they judged the two objects to be visually dissimilar/similar to each\nother. Participants were asked to flip through the booklet to appreciate the\nnature and variability of the picture pairs. They were then asked to make their\njudgements of dissimilarity/similarity relative to the total set of 132 picture\npairs.\nRatings of the picture pairs. Across all participants, an average rating for\neach of the 132 picture pairs was determined. The overall means for pairs of\npossible and impossible objects were \u2013 0.63 and \u2013 0.55, respectively, a differ-\nence that proved to be insignificant by ANOVA, F(1, 130) < 1.\nRatings of individual objects. For each of the 24 objects, an average rating\nwas derived from each participants ratings of all the picture pairs in which it\nwas involved. These average ratings were submitted to an ANOVA with\nobjects as a within-participants factor. The main effect of object was signifi-\ncant, F(23, 322) = 4.11, p < .001, indicating that the rating procedure had mea-\nsured the distinctiveness of the objects with some reliability. A planned\ncomparison confirmed that the difference in the average rating of possible and\nimpossible objects was not significant, F(1, 14) = 0.06, p = .81. When the\n606 WALKER, DIXON, SMITH\nratings of distinctiveness for the 24 objects were correlated with the memora-\nbility scores obtained in Experiment 1, the relationship proved to be insignifi-\ncant, r = .26, p > .10.\nDiscussion\nTelling participants in advance that their memory would be tested enhanced\nrecognition memory for the pictures, equally so for possible and impossible\nobjects. This enhancement could reflect the impact of some global aspect of\nprocessing, such as an increase in the overall level of resources allocated to the\ntask. Alternatively, it could reflect a qualitative shift towards relying on partic-\nular processes and representations. For example, knowing that their memory\nwas to be tested, participants could have related the pictures to familiar objects\nthey resembled. It has already been noted that adding functional and associative\ndecisions to the encoding of picture primes enhances recognition memory, and\ndoes so equally for possible and impossible objects (Schacter & Cooper, 1993;\nSchacter et al., 1991a). Whatever qualitative shift in processing might underpin\nthe enhanced levels of recognition, however, it is clear from the results of\nExperiment 1 that it does not involve a greater reliance on representations of\nglobal 3D shape, since such a shift would favour pictures of possible objects\nover pictures of impossible objects.\nPrevious studies have occasionally failed to find an effect of object possibil-\nity on intentional recognition memory, even when there has been an effect on\nobject decision (e.g., Cooper et al., 1992b, Exp. 1; Schacter et al., 1991a).\nExperiment 1 has shown that this insensitivity to object possibility can extend\nto incidental as well as intentional remembering. In the light of the power of this\nexperiment to detect an effect of object possibility, these null results offer reas-\nsurance that the present sets of pictures are matched with regard to their individ-\nual memorability (see also the results of Experiment 5 later, where incidental\nrecognition memory for these pictures again failed to show an effect of object\npossibility). In addition, the supplementary observations indicate that the two\nsets of pictures were also matched regarding their visual distinctiveness. If it is\nnow found that object possibility influences the ease with which names for\nnovel objects are learned, then this can be attributed with greater confidence to\nthe task of associating object shape with object name.\nEXPERIMENT 2\nThe issue of whether object names are more easily learned to pictures of possi-\nble objects than to pictures of impossible objects was addressed directly in\nExperiment 2. The presentation of each picture was accompanied by a spoken\nnonsense syllable in the context of a sentence frame that assigned it the role of a\ncount noun (e.g., \u201cThis is a dax.\u201d). Participants were requested to learn the non-\nOBJECT SHAPE\u2013NAME LINKS 607\nword associated with each picture, so that when subsequently presented with a\npicture they could recall the corresponding non-word.\nParticipants. Forty undergraduate students at Lancaster University partic-\nipated in the experiment. None had participated in Experiment 1.\nMaterials. The 24 pictures utilized in Experiment 1 (12 possible and 12\nimpossible objects) were also used in Experiment 2. In addition, 24 single-\nsyllable non-words were generated to serve as verbal labels for the pictures (cf.\nTable 2).\nDesign. A within-participants design was employed, with object type and\ntrial number as the two factors. Each participant was exposed to two types of\nobject (possible and impossible) on each of four successive learning trials.\nMemory for each picture\u2013non-word association was assessed on every trial.\nProcedure. A random order of presentation for the 24 pictures was deter-\nmined for each participant, with the constraint that no more than two successive\npresentations involved an object from the same category. This order was used\nin the learning phase on all four trials. In this phase the experimenter presented\neach picture for 5sec and at the same time gave a spoken verbal label to be asso-\nciated with it. Every verbal label incorporated a different one of the non-words,\npresented in a standard sentence frame that assigned to it the function of a count\nnoun (e.g., \u201cThis is a dax.\u201d, \u201cThis is a rif.\u201d). The 24 non-words were randomly\nassigned to the pictures, differently for each participant, and the pairings were\nfixed across all four trials. After presentation of the picture\u2013label pairs, the pic-\n608 WALKER, DIXON, SMITH\nTABLE 2\nThe single syllable non-\nwords to be associated with\nthe possible and impossible\nobjects\nDax Nid\nRif Rin\nDep Vob\nBax Lum\nSif Nop\nGeb Tol\nKiv Ruv\nFob Mit\nBal Wib\nBav Wut\nZib Zal\nGef Lef\ntures were randomly re-ordered for the test of memory. The experimenter re-\npresented each picture in turn and asked for the associated non-word. Partici-\npants were permitted to offer no response if they could not recall the non-word,\nbut when a response was offered no feedback was provided regarding its cor-\nrectness. There was no pressure on participants to respond within a certain time.\nThe next trial started with another learning phase in which the pictures were\nagain presented with their verbal labels. A further test phase followed in which\nthe pictures were presented in a fresh random order. Each participant com-\npleted a total of four trials.\nResults\nTable 3 presents the mean number of names correctly recalled by a participant\nas a function of object type and trial number.\nPerformance improved across successive trials, as one would expect. In\naddition, from trial 1 through to trial 4, the names of possible objects were\nrecalled better than the names of impossible objects. A 4 (Trial Number) \u00d7 2\n(Object Possibility) ANOVA confirmed the significance of trial number, F(3,\n117) = 157, p < 001, and object possibility, F(1, 39) = 27.0, p < 001. The interac-\ntion between these two factors was not significant, F(3, 117) = 2.34, p = .07.\nTests of simple effects showed that object possibility had a significant effect on\nevery trial, F(1, 39) = 9.96, 18.25, 14.45, and 12.52, for trials 1 to 4, respec-\ntively, p < 005 in all cases.\nAn item-based analysis was undertaken on the average number of trials\n(max. = 4) on which the name of each picture was correctly recalled by a partici-\npant. The overall means were 1.5 and 1.13 for possible and impossible objects,\nrespectively. The effectof object possibility was significant, F(1, 22) = 4.78, p<\n.04. This effect remained when the memorability and distinctiveness of the 24\nitems (see Experiment 1) were treated as covariates, F(1, 21) = 4.78 and 4.62,\nrespectively, p = .04 in both cases. A second item-based analysis was under-\ntaken on the number of participants correctly recalling the name of each picture\non each of the four trials. The average number of participants recalling the\nname of a possible object on an individual trial was 15.17. The average number\nOBJECT SHAPE\u2013NAME LINKS 609\nTABLE 3\nExperiment 2: Mean number of names recalled by a\nparticipant as a function of object type and trial\nnumber (max. score = 12)\nTrial Number\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nObject Type 1 2 3 4\nPossible 1.10 3.47 5.97 7.60\nImpossible 0.52 2.00 4.67 6.37\nof participants recalling the name of an impossible object on an individual trial\nwas 11.29. An ANOVA, with possibility as a between-items factor and trial as a\nwithin-items factor, confirmed the significance of both the effect of object pos-\nsibility, F(1, 22) = 5.18, p < .04, and the effect of trial, F(3, 66) = 296, p< .001.\nAlthough the overall interaction between object possibility and trial was not\nsignificant, F(3, 66) = 1.71, p = .17, analysis of simple effects revealed that\nobject possibility had an effect on all trials except the first, F(1, 36) = 0.89, 6.46,\n5.22, 5.02, with p = .35, .01, .03, .03, for trials 1 to 4, respectively. Once again,\nthe main effect of object possibility remained when item memorability and dis-\ntinctiveness were treated as covariates, F(1, 21) = 5.14 and 5.13, respectively, p\n< .04 in each case.\nDiscussion\nNames can be learned more easily to pictures of possible objects than to pic-\ntures of impossible objects, consistent with the idea that names are closely\nlinked with descriptions of the overall, 3D shapes of objects. Since the results of\nExperiment 1 confirmed that the two types of picture were themselves equally\nmemorable and equally distinctive, and since the non-words were randomly\nassigned to the pictures, the different levels of name learning across the two\ntypes of picture appear to reflect aspects of the association between object\nshape and object name.\nEXPERIMENT 3\nParticipants in Experiment 2 found themselves in a rather artificial situation,\nbeing asked to learn associations between visual and verbal items that had little\nrelevance to the real world and which they assumed would not be encountered\nagain. It is possible, therefore, that the learning observed across the four trials\nof Experiment 2 reflects the involvement of special purpose mechanisms, spe-\ncifically and temporarily established for the experimental task. The learning\nmight not reflect processes normally supporting the long-term learning of\nobject names, and the observed impact of object possibility might have no bear-\ning on the organization of long-term knowledge about objects and their names.\nTwo months after Experiment 2 was run, the opportunity arose to re-test 16\nof the original participants, to determine if there was still some retention of the\nshape\u2013name associations and, if so, if the effect of object possibility was still\napparent. The participants had no expectation that they might be approached to\ntake part in a further study and had not, therefore, taken any steps to rehearse the\nshape\u2013name associations encountered in Experiment 2.\n610 WALKER, DIXON, SMITH\nMethod\nParticipants . Sixteen of the original participants were recruited two\nmonths after taking part in Experiment 2. Their availability was not under the\ncontrol of the researchers, but was determined by a mix of circumstances unre-\nlated to the purpose of the study.\nMaterials. The materials prepared for Experiment 2 were used again, and\nfor each participant the original shape\u2013name associations were retained.\nDesign and procedure . Essentially the same design and procedure were\nadopted as for Experiment 2. The one modification involved dispensing with\nthe study phase on the first of the four trials completed by each participant.\nThus, the experiment started with a testing phase to assess the extent to which\nparticipants could still recall the name associated with each picture. Thereafter,\nthe remaining three trials were completed in the same way as for Experiment 2.\nIn the study phase the experimenter presented each picture along with its asso-\nciated non-word. In the testing phase each picture was presented in turn, in a\nfresh random order, and participants were requested to recall the associated\nnon-word. As before, no feedback was provided regarding the correctness of a\nresponse.\nResults\nTable 4 presents the mean number of non-words correctly recalled as a function\nof object possibility and trial number. The results from Experiment 2 for the\nsame 16 participants are also presented.\nOBJECT SHAPE\u2013NAME LINKS 611\nTABLE 4\nMean number of names recalled by a participant as\na function of experiment, object type, and trial\nnumber for participants taking part in both\nexperiments (max. score = 12)\nTrial Number\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nObject Type 1 2 3 4\nExperiment 2\nPossible 1.00 2.56 4.94 6.75\nImpossible 0.37 1.31 3.50 5.31\nExperiment 3\nPossible 1.94 5.56 7.44 8.56\nImpossible 1.12 4.44 6.19 8.19\nPerformance is consistently superior in Experiment 3, indicating that over\nthe 2-month period between the experiments some information about the origi-\nnal shape\u2013name associations had been retained. Not only does there appear to\nbe savings in relearning the shape\u2013name associations across trials 2 to 4, but\nperformance on trial 1 of Experiment 3 is better than performance on trial 1 of\nExperiment 2. Performance also improves across successive trials and the\nnames of possible objects are recalled better than the names of impossible\nobjects on every trial in each experiment.\nA 2 (Experiment) \u00d7 4 (Trial Number) \u00d7 2 (Object Possibility) ANOVA\nrevealed significant main effects of experiment, F(1, 15) = 25.91, p = .0001,\ntrial number, F(3, 45) = 71.42, p = 0, and object possibility, F(1, 15) = 22.49, p =\n.001. The interaction between experiment and trial number was significant F(3,\n45) = 9.24, p = .0001, but no other interactions approached significance.\nSeparate ANOVAs were also undertaken for each experiment. For Experi-\nment 2, the main effect of trial number was significant, F(3, 45) = 45.4, p = 0, as\nwas the main effect of object possibility, F(1, 15) = 18.36, p = .0001. The inter-\naction between these two factors was not significant, F(3, 45) = 1.23, p = .31.\nAnalysis of simple effects confirmed that object possibility had a significant\neffect on every trial, F(1, 15) = 6.82, 8.33, 6.89, and 16.57, for trials 1 to 4,\nrespectively, p < .025 in all cases. A similar pattern of significant effects was\nconfirmed for Experiment 3. The main effect of trial number, F(3, 45) = 72.64,\np = 0, and the main effect of object possibility, F(1, 15) = 10.16, p < .01, were\nboth significant. The interaction between these effects was not significant,\nF(3,45) = 1.44, p = .24. Analysis of simple effects revealed that object possibil-\nity had a significant effect on each of trials 1 to 3, but not on trial 4: F(1, 15) =\n8.59, p = .01; F(1, 15) = 19.29, p = .001; F(1, 15) = 5.6, p = .032; and, F(1, 15) =\n0.68, p = .42, respectively.\nFinally, a 2 (Experiment) \u00d7 2 (Object Possibility) ANOVA was undertaken\nfor the first trial of both experiments. The main effect of experiment was signif-\nicant, F(1, 15) = 4.46, p = .05, as was the main effect of object possibility, F(1,\n15) = 16.57, p = .001. The interaction between these two factors was not signifi-\ncant, F(1, 15) < 1. Simple effects analysis confirmed that object possibility had\na significant impact on performance in both Experiment 2 and Experiment 3,\nF(1, 15) = 6.82 and 8.59, respectively, p < .025 in each case.\nDiscussion\nTwo months after their involvement in Experiment 2, participants showed\nsome retention of the shape\u2013name associations they had learned, and the effect\nof object possibility was still in evidence. Participants had not anticipated\nhaving their memory tested again. Therefore, the results encourage the view\nthat the learning in Experiment 2 reflected processes normally associated with\n612 WALKER, DIXON, SMITH\nthe long-term learning of object names, rather than with special purpose pro-\ncesses established temporarily for the specific task at hand.\nEXPERIMENT 4\nExperiment 4 replicated Experiment 2 except for the manner in which memory\nfor the shape\u2013name associations was tested. Instead of presenting a picture and\nasking participants to recall the associated name, the picture\u2013name association\nwas tested in the reverse direction. The experimenter presented each name (by\nsaying, for example, \u201cWhich is the dax?\u201d) and asked participants to pick out the\nassociated picture from the total set of 24 displayed on the table in front of them.\nAs in Experiment 2, a different random order of testing the name\u2013picture asso-\nciations was used on each of the four trials.\nMethod\nParticipants. Twenty undergraduate students at Lancaster University par-\nticipated in the experiment. None had participated in the preceding experi-\nments.\nMaterials, design, and procedure. These were the same as for Experiment\n2, with participants again completing four trials, each comprising a study and\ntest phase. The one procedural difference related to the way in which memory\nfor the shape\u2013name associations was tested. At the beginning of each test\nphase, the experimenter displayed all 24 cards on the table in front of the partic-\nipant in a random arrangement. She then presented each non-word within the\ncontext of a sentence frame that asked participants to point out the associated\npicture (e.g., \u201cWhich is the dax?\u201d).\nResults\nTable 5 presents the mean number of objects correctly identified by a partici-\npant as a function of object type and trial number.\nOBJECT SHAPE\u2013NAME LINKS 613\nTABLE 5\nExperiment 4: Mean number of objects correctly\nidentified by a participant as a function of object\ntype and trial number (max. score = 12)\nTrial Number\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nObject Type 1 2 3 4\nPossible 2.75 4.45 6.40 8.00\nImpossible 2.20 4.10 5.60 7.30\nPerformance improved across successive trials, as one would expect. In\naddition, on all four trials pictures of possible objects were more often correctly\nidentified than were pictures of impossible objects. A 4 (Trial Number) \u00d7 2\n(Object Possibility) ANOVA confirmed the significance of trial number, F(3,\n57) = 82.03, p < .001, and object possibility, F(1, 19) = 6.87, p < .02. The inter-\naction between these two factors was not significant, F(3, 57) < 1. Tests of\nsimple effects showed that object possibility failed to have a significant effect\non trials 1 and 2, F(1, 19) = 1.24, p = .28, and F(1, 19) = 0.54, p = .47, respec-\ntively. However, on trials 3 and 4 the effect of object possibility was significant,\nF(1, 19) = 4.75, p < .05, and F(1, 19) = 6.60, p < .02, respectively. In contrast\nwith Experiment 2, a significant effect of object possibility was not observed on\nall four trials, and the less robust nature of the effect meant that it did not emerge\nas a significant factor in an item-based analysis. It is not clear why this should\nbe so, though the procedure might be seen to hold potential for more inter-\nference during memory retrieval (participants needed to scan the set of 24 pic-\ntures after being given a name, even if they could recall the corresponding\npicture without looking for it, and this may be more prone to interference than\nretrieving a name in response to the presentation of a single picture).\nDiscussion\nA possible objects coherent, 3D structure makes it easier to learn its name, even\nwhen this is tested in the reverse direction, i.e., when people select a pictured\nobject in response to hearing a name. Of course, adopting a procedure that\nprobes the association in the reverse direction does not guarantee that the\nunderlying representations were also accessed in the reverse direction. It is con-\nceivable, for example, that after hearing a name probe, participants looked at\neach picture in turn, retrieved its name, and then compared this against the\nname probe offered by the experimenter. Although further work is needed to\nreveal the way underlying processes differ according to task instructions, the\npresent results do suggest that the privileged link between global, 3D shape and\nobject name will impact on behaviour in a variety of situations.\nEXPERIMENT 5\nPrevious studies have been interpreted as demonstrating that object decision\nand recognition can draw on separate visual representations (see Cooper &\nSchacter, 1992). The dependence of object decision performance exclusively\non structural descriptions of the global, 3D shapes of objects is understandable\ngiven the nature of the information on which the decisions have to be made.\nConfirmation of this comes from the observation that priming is confined to\npossible objects and to situations in which the encoding task requires attention\nto be focused on the global shapes of the objects (Schacter et al., 1990). More\n614 WALKER, DIXON, SMITH\ngenerally, however, the stochastic independence of object decision and recog-\nnition for previously studied possible objects is indicative of the absence of\nshared processes (Schacter et al., 1990, 1991a). Finally, object decisions have\nproven insensitive to a range of manipulations that influence recognition\nmemory (Cooper et al., 1992b; Schacter & Cooper, 1993; Schacter et al.,\n1991a).\nThe idea that recognition can utilize representations other than those sup-\nporting object decision also receives some support (Cooper & Schacter, 1992).\nApart from the stochastic independence of the two types of decision, there have\nbeen occasions when object possibility has had little or no impact on recogni-\ntion memory, despite having a big impact on object decision (see, for example,\nCooper et al., 1992b, Exp. 1; Schacter et al., 1991a). In addition, particular\nchanges in the encoding instructions have been seen to eliminate priming in the\nobject decision task, while at the same time enhancing recognition memory for\nthe same objects (Schacter et al., 1990).\nGiven the nature of the information on which object decisions have to be\nmade, the claim that they rely exclusively on structural descriptions of global,\n3D shape would seem a reasonable one. However, the idea that recognition\nmemory relies exclusively on other representations, and not at all on the repre-\nsentations underpinning object decisions, is not so easy to explain. One expla-\nnation might start with the premise that structural descriptions can contribute to\nimplicit remembering (e.g., priming) but not to explicit remembering (e.g., rec-\nognition) (Cooper & Schacter, 1992; Schacter et al. 1990). Support for this\npremise has been drawn from the fact that amnesic patients show normal levels\nof priming in the object decision task (Schacter, Cooper, Tharan, & Rubens,\n1991b). However, appealing to the general distinction between implicit and\nexplicit remembering introduces its own uncertainties. For example, it is\nunclear why, in principle, a structural description system could not contribute\nto explicit remembering. Indeed, although there have been occasions when\nobject possibility has had little or no effect on recognition memory, despite\nhaving a big impact on object decision, (see, for example, Cooper, Schacter,\nBallesteros, & Moore, 1992, Exp. 1; Schacter et al., 1991a), there have been\nother occasions when it has had a consistent and significant effect on recogni-\ntion memory (see, for example, Schacter & Cooper, 1993). Furthermore, in\nExperiments 2 and 3 of the present study, an effect of object possibility was\nobserved in a test of explicit remembering, albeit a test that focused on memory\nfor object\u2013name associations rather than on memory for the objects them-\nselves. Indeed, Cooper, Schacter, Ballesteros, and Moore (1992, p. 54)\nacknowledge that object possibility can influence explicit recognition memory.\nThey propose that any source of information that can distinguish to-be-remem-\nbered items, including structural descriptions recoverable from possible\nobjects, can support episodic retrieval processes, provided these sources of\ninformation were part of the conditions under which the items were originally\nOBJECT SHAPE\u2013NAME LINKS 615\nencoded. The final experiment to be reported explores this issue in relation to\nshape\u2013name associations.\nExperiment 1 failed to reveal an effect of object possibility on recognition\nmemory, whether or not participants were forewarned that their memory would\nbe tested. However, in previous studies, object-decision priming and the\naccompanying effects of object possibility have been observed only when the\nencoding instructions have directed participants\u2019 attention to the global shape\nof each object (e.g., Schacter et al., 1990). Thus, priming of possible objects has\nbeen observed when participants have indicated whether each priming object\nfaced left or right, but not when they have said if it contained more vertical or\nhorizontal edges. It would appear, therefore, that deriving a structural descrip-\ntion of an objects overall shape is not obligatory, and is partly determined by the\nencoding instructions. In turn, therefore, object possibility might influence rec-\nognition only when the encoding instructions ensure the salience of the global\nshape of each object.\nEvidence was reviewed in the Introduction suggesting that representations\nof the global, 3D shapes of objects have privileged links with their names. So\nthat, for example, naming objects at presentation draws peoples attention to\nobject shape, with the result that the objects are categorised according to their\nshape and their names are extended to new objects on this basis (Landau, 1994).\nExperiment 5 examines incidental and intentional memory for pictures of\nobjects in the manner of Experiment 1, but incorporates a condition in which\nthe objects are named by the experimenter as they are presented in the study\nphase. In this way the experiment tests two ideas. First, hearing a pictured\nobject named at presentation will increase the likelihood that a representation\nof its global, 3D shape is derived. Second, such a representation will support\nrecognition memory for the picture. Therefore, in the condition where objects\nare named at presentation, it is predicted that recognition memory will be supe-\nrior for pictures of possible objects compared with pictures of impossible\nobjects. By contrast, in the condition where objects are not named at presenta-\ntion, it is predicted that recognition memory will be equivalent for possible and\nimpossible objects, as was observed in Experiment 1.\nMethod\nParticipants. Eighty undergraduate students at Lancaster University par-\nticipated in the experiment. None had participated in any of the previous exper-\niments. Twenty students were randomly assigned to each of the four conditions\nobtained by crossing two factors\u2014Naming (no-naming versus naming) and\nMemory Condition (incidental versus intentional remembering)\u2014with the\nconstraint that the same number of male (and female) participants took part in\neach condition.\n616 WALKER, DIXON, SMITH\nMaterials. Pictures of 10 possible and 10 impossible objects were selected\nat random from the pool of pictures used in Experiment 1. Similarly, 20 of the\nsingle-syllable non-words generated for Experiment 2 were selected at random\nfor use here.\nDesign. A mixed design was employed, with Naming and Memory Con-\ndition as between-participants factors, and Object Possibility as a within-\nparticipants factor. For each trial, five possible and five impossible objects\nwere selected at random from the set of 20 pictures. For the naming condition,\n10 of the non-words were randomly selected from the pool of 20 and randomly\nassigned for each participant to the 10 to-be-remembered pictures.\nProcedure. The procedure was essentially the same as for Experiment 1,\nwith arithmetic again providing a cover story in the incidental memory condi-\ntion to hide the fact that recognition memory for the pictures was to be tested.\nFor the no-naming condition the same procedure was used as for Experiment 1.\nThe only difference for the naming condition was that the experimenter named\neach picture as it was presented during the study phase. The non-words were\nembedded in a sentence frame that gave them the role of a count noun (e.g.,\n\u201cThis is a dax.\u201d).\nAfter presentation of the sequence of to-be-remembered pictures, all 20 pic-\ntures selected for that trial were displayed on a table in front of the participant.\nIn the naming condition no mention was made of the names that had been asso-\nciated with the objects during the study phase. Rather, participants were\nrequested simply to identify the pictures they had seen earlier.\nParticipants completed just one trial and in the incidental memory condition\nthey were asked if they had anticipated the memory test. In the event, this was\nnot anticipated by any of the participants.\nResults\nTable 6 presents the mean number of possible and impossible objects correctly\nrecognized by a participant as a function of the naming and memory conditions.\nFor the no-naming condition, the results replicate those obtained in Experiment\n1. Although recall is generally enhanced by an intention to remember, it is not\ninfluenced by object possibility. For the naming condition, the pattern of results\nis different. Although there is again a general increase in recall with an inten-\ntion to remember, there is now an effect of object possibility, with structurally\npossible objects being better recalled than impossible objects. A 2 (Naming\nCondition) \u00d7 2 (Memory Condition) \u00d7 2 (Object Possibility) ANOVA revealed\nsignificant main effects of memory condition, F(1, 76) = 14.01, p < .001, and\nobject possibility, F(1, 76) = 12.27, p < .001. Although the main effect of\nnaming was not significant, F(1, 76) < 1, its interaction with object possibility\nOBJECT SHAPE\u2013NAME LINKS 617\nwas significant, F(1, 76) = 9.39, p < .01. Analysis of simple effects confirmed\nthat object possibility influenced memory in the naming condition, F(1, 76) =\n21.56, p < .001, but not in the no-naming condition, F(1, 76) < 1.\nAn item-based analysis was undertaken on the number of participants cor-\nrectly remembering each of the 20 items. After collapsing the data across the\nincidental and intentional memory conditions, an ANOVA was completed with\nobject possibility as a between-items factor and naming as a within-items fac-\ntor. Although the main effectsof naming and object possibility were not signifi-\ncant, F(1, 18) < 1, and F(1, 18) = 1.34, p = .26, the interaction between these\nfactors was marginally significant, F(1, 18) = 4.06, p = .06. Analysis of simple\neffects confirmed that, whereas object possibility had no effect on memory in\nthe no-naming condition, F(1, 18) < 1, it had a significant effect in the naming\ncondition, F(1, 18) = 5.82, p < .03.\nFinally, except for the fact that a fixed sub-set of 20 pictures was used in\nExperiment 5, the no-naming condition provides a replication of Experiment 1.\nWhen the results from this condition were combined with those from Experi-\nment 1, the overall mean number of possible and impossible objects correctly\nrecognized on an individual trial was 3.59 and 3.61, respectively (out of 5 in\neach case). With memory condition (incidental versus intentional) as a\nbetween-participants factor and object possibility as a within-participants fac-\ntor, ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of memory condition, with\nbetter recall in the intentional condition than in the incidental condition (3.84\nversus 3.37, respectively). The main effect of object possibility and its interac-\ntion with memory condition were both very small and insignificant, F(1, 118) =\n0.18 and .07, respectively. With the results of 120 participants contributing to\nthis analysis, there is protection against a Type II error in relation to these null\n618 WALKER, DIXON, SMITH\nTABLE 6\nExperiment 5: Mean number of possible and impossible\nobjects correctly recognized by a participant as a function\nof whether or not objects were named at study, and\nwhether remembering was incidental or intentional\nObject Type\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nNaming Condition Memory Condition Possible Impossible\nNo-naming\nIncidental 2.85 2.80\nIntentional 3.60 3.55\nNaming\nIncidental 3.30 2.50\nIntentional 3.60 2.90\nMaximum score = 5, chance = 2.5.\nresults (see the discussion of effect size, power, and sample size in the context\nof Experiment 1).\nDiscussion\nObject possibility enhanced recognition memory, but only when objects were\nnamed at presentation. Hearing an object named at presentation appears to have\nincreased the likelihood that a description of its global, 3D shape was derived.\nThis description then supported recognition memory, so that naming enhanced\nmemory for possible objects only. This finding reinforces the idea that names\nhave privileged links with descriptions of global, 3D shape, and contradicts the\nview that recognition memory cannot be supported by such descriptions (see\nCooper & Schacter 1992, for a review). Therefore, as Cooper et al. (1992b, p.\n54) propose, recognition memory, like object decision, can be supported by\ndescriptions of global, 3D shape when the original encoding task encourages\nthe derivation of these descriptions (see also, Schacter et al., 1990).\nGENERAL DISCUSSION\nThe present study has compared peoples memory for pictures of possible and\nimpossible objects and provided evidence that object names are closely linked\nwith representations of global, 3D shape. When people learned single-syllable\nnon-words as names (count nouns) for pictures of objects, they did so more eas-\nily for structurally possible objects than for structurally impossible objects\n(Experiments 2\u20134). This effect was independent of the memorability and dis-\ntinctiveness of the individual items. Given that the non-words were randomly\nassigned to the pictures, the differential ease with which names were learned to\npossible and impossible objects appears to reflect the differential memorability\nof different types of object\u2013name association. More specifically, the results\nindicate that object names have close links with the descriptions of global, 3D\nshape that are recoverable from structurally possible objects but not from struc-\nturally impossible objects.\nWhereas in Experiments 2 and 3 participants memory for picture\u2013name\nassociations was tested by presenting a picture and asking for the correspond-\ning name, in Experiment 4 it was tested by presenting a name and asking for the\ncorresponding picture to be selected from the pool. In each case, name learning\nwas easier for pictures of possible objects, suggesting some generality to the\nprocesses being revealed.\nExperiment 3 showed that the associations learned in Experiment 2 were\nretained, albeit imperfectly, for 2 months, even though participants had no\nexpectation that their memory for the associations would be tested again. Had\nthe learning been confined to the period of Experiment 2, it might have been\nseen to reflect special purpose mechanisms, specifically and temporarily\nOBJECT SHAPE\u2013NAME LINKS 619\nestablished for the experimental task. Instead, however, it seems that memory\nfor the associations reflected processes supporting the long-term learning of\nobject names. The impact of object possibility implies, therefore, that descrip-\ntions of global, 3\u2013D shape normally contribute to such long-term learning in the\nreal world.\nExperiments 1 and 5 indicated that the derivation of a description of the\nglobal, 3D shape of an object is not obligatory. When the encoding task does\nnot draw peoples attention to this aspect of an object, object possibility need not\nhave an effect on recognition memory, even when remembering is intentional.\nHowever, when another person is heard to name the object at presentation, then\nobject possibility has an effect on recognition memory, indicating two things.\nFirst, hearing the name of an object increases the probability that a description\nof its global shape will be derived. Second, explicit recognition memory for the\nobject can benefit from the availability of such a description.\nThe results of Experiments 1 and 5 are consistent with previous work com-\nparing memory for possible and impossible objects. Thus, priming in the object\ndecision task, seen as reflecting the derivation of a structural description, has\nbeen observed only when the encoding task has drawn attention to the objects\nglobal shape (Schacter et al., 1990). A strong prediction from the present study\nis that hearing objects named at presentation will provide an encoding context\nthat gives rise to priming in the object decision task. In addition, object possibil-\nity has occasionally been observed to influence recognition. This has occurred\nin situations where the encoding task has drawn attention to the global shape of\nthe objects and where, as a consequence, priming of object decisions has been\nobserved (Cooper et al., 1992b; Schacter & Cooper, 1993; Schacter et al., 1990;\nSchacter et al., 1991a). The results of Experiments 1 and 5 also indicate that a\ndescription of an objects global shape will influence recognition memory when\nattention is drawn to that aspect of the object during the study phase. Hearing\nsomeone else name an object appears to serve this purpose.\nBoucart and Humphreys (1992) and Boucart, Humphreys, and Lorenceau\n(1995) have provided evidence for a close association between attending to the\nglobal form of a pictured object and object identification. They demonstrate\nthat object identification occurs automatically whenever visual attention is\ndirected at the global form of an object. This happens, for example, when par-\nticipants judge whether two successively presented pictures depict objects hav-\ning the same global shape or the same general orientation in the picture plane.\nObject identification does not occur automatically when participants attend to\nlocal features of the pictures, as when they judge whether two pictures have\nbeen drawn with the same colour of line. Boucart et al. (Boucart & Humphreys,\n1992; Boucart et al., 1995) conclude that attending to the global form of a stim-\nulus is a sufficient condition for activating the stored object representations\nmediating object identification. Extending these ideas to the present study, we\nwould suggest that hearing someone name an object will encourage attention to\n620 WALKER, DIXON, SMITH\nbe directed globally, at the overall configuration of a figure (i.e., with attention\nzoomed-out to just the right degree), because this allows the types of represen-\ntation most supportive of object categorization to be encoded. We predict,\ntherefore, that object naming will cause attention to be broadly spread in order\nto simultaneously embrace the external contours (envelope) of a pictured\nobject.\nThere is other evidence indicating that the derivation of object-based\ndescriptions of 3D shape is not obligatory, but requires the encoding task to\ndirect attention appropriately. In a study examining the role of attention in per-\nceptual constancy, Epstein and Lovitts (1985) have shown that for a post-con-\nstancy representation of an objects shape to be derived, it is not sufficient for a\nperson to look at the object, even if this involves close inspection (as is needed,\nfor example, to count the number of small marks along its principal axis). How-\never, a post-constancy description of shape is derived when people are told that\ntheir recognition memory for each object will be tested and that study-test\nchanges in the objects orientation in depth will need to be taken into account. In\nother words, a post-constancy description of shape is derived when it is\nexplained that the representation on which the recognition decision is to be\nmade is a viewpoint-independent representation of object shape. A prediction\nfrom the present study would be that naming a shape will increase the likeli-\nhood that a post-constancy description is derived. One final point worth making\nin the context of this work is that Epstein and Lovitts employed recognition\nmemory as the dependent variable, and so their results provide further evidence\nthat viewpoint-independent descriptions of object shape can contribute to\nexplicit recognition memory. These results make it difficult to defend either the\nclaim that implicit and explicit memory draw on separate representations, or\nthe claim that explicit recognition memory for objects cannot draw on the types\nof description of object shape that mediate priming in the object decision task.\nInstead, it seems that whereas object decision relies exclusively on a represen-\ntation of an objects global, 3D structure, recognition memory can utilize these\nand other representations. The other representations appear to be equivalent for\npossible and impossible objects, and so must involve more localized object fea-\ntures. Judging from previous work they also seem to preserve information\nabout parity and size, and are assumed to preserve objects surface features, such\nas colour (Biederman & Cooper, 1992; Cooper, 1994; Cooper & Schacter,\n1992; Cooper et al., 1992b).\nBarbara Landau and her colleagues (see Landau, 1994; Landau et al., 1998)\nhave shown that labelling an object with a count noun draws attention to its\nshape, with the effect that names are extended to novel objects on the basis of\ntheir shape. This has proved to be quite a specific effect, since it can be replaced\nby a bias towards extending names on the basis of material and surface proper-\nties if a standard object is labelled with a non-word in the guise of an adjective\n(e.g., \u201cThis is a daxy one\u201d, \u201cWhich of these is a daxy one?\u201d). Of course, in order\nOBJECT SHAPE\u2013NAME LINKS 621\nto create a bias to respond according to the material and surface properties of an\nobject, it is important that these properties are clearly discriminable. If they are\nnot, then there is little alternative to shape as a basis for categorization and name\nextension.\nIt would have been valuable to further explore the links between object rep-\nresentations and verbal labels by examining the interaction between object pos-\nsibility and type of verbal label assigned to a picture (count noun versus\nadjective). The effects of object possibility would have been expected to be\nmuch less evident, if evident at all, for the adjective labels. Unfortunately,\nalthough simple line drawings can depict object shape very effectively via\nedge-based features, and are an ideal medium for depicting impossible objects,\nthey are much less appropriate for depicting material and surface properties.\nTherefore, in order to examine the interaction between object possibility and\ntype of verbal label, it will be necessary to present objects in a different way, but\nin a way that is still capable of depicting impossible, as well as possible, objects.\nTwo other lines of research also encourage the view that there is a close link\nbetween representations concerned exclusively with object shape and repre-\nsentations of object name. One line of research has investigated the visual\nrepresentations utilized by people when they combine visual images of two\nrecently presented pictures in order to identify an emergent form\n(Brandimonte, Hitch, & Bishop, 1992; Hitch, Brandimonte, & Walker, 1995;\nWalker, Hitch, Dewhurst, Whiteley, & Brandimonte, 1997). Two types of\nvisual representation have been shown to support image combination. The first\nis a relatively literal representation preserving information about the surface\nproperties of an object (e.g., colour and texture) as well as its shape. The second\nis a more abstract representation concerned solely with object shape. Of partic-\nular relevance in the context of the present study is the observation that naming\nthe to-be-combined objects at presentation causes people to rely on the second\ntype of representation to discover the emergent form (Brandimonte et al., 1992;\nHitch et al., 1995; Walker et al., 1997).\nThe second line of investigation is concerned with the manner in which\nyoung children depict objects in their drawings. It has been observed that nam-\ning a familiar object increases the likelihood that children, when drawing the\nobject, will depict parts that are currently out of view (Bremner & Moore, 1984;\nLewis, Russell, & Berridge, 1993) Indeed, Bremner and Moore found that\nnaming the object had the same effect on childrens drawings as allowing them\nprior inspection of the object from a variety of angles, something that would be\nexpected to support the derivation of a global, viewpoint independent descrip-\ntion of the object. Bremner and Moore, and Lewis et al. propose that naming\nhad this effect because viewpoint-independent categorical representations of\nobjects are tagged with their category names. More recently, Walker, Cooper,\nand Bremner (submitted) have demonstrated that when 5- and 6-year-old chil-\ndren hear the experimenter name a novel object with a novel name (\u201cThis is a\n622 WALKER, DIXON, SMITH\ndax\u201d) their drawings of the object are more likely to include a hidden part.\nWalker et al. argue that this happens because names are directly linked to view-\npoint-independent representations of the particular object being drawn, and\nthese representations incorporate information about all the important parts of\nan object, including any that are currently out of view.\nOther researchers have presented strong arguments for the idea that repre-\nsentation of an objects shape is linked to representation of its name only indi-\nrectly, via representation of its semantic features (for reviews, see Bruce &\nHumphreys, 1994, and Humphreys, Lamote, & Lloyd-Jones, 1995). For exam-\nple, the Interactive Activation and Competition (IAC) approach to object pro-\ncessing (Humphreys et al., 1995) assumes a hierarchical organization across\nthese different domains of representation (pools of representational units), with\nstructural units being activated before semantic units, which in turn are acti-\nvated before name units. Hence, it is argued that semantic knowledge needs to\nbe   activated   for   object   naming   to   be   possible,   and   evidence   from\nneuropsychology is recruited to support this argument. However, despite its\nhierarchical organization, the IAC model assumes a direct mapping of sorts\nbetween structural units and name units, because semantic units are relatively\ndirectly linked to structural units to reflect the fact that for many object catego-\nries category members are structurally similar to each other. Thus, in the\ngraphic illustration of the IAC model, Humphreys et al. show individual struc-\ntural units mapping on to individual semantic units, which in turn map on to\nindividual name units.\nThe objects depicted in the pictures used in the present study were designed\nto be largely devoid of semantic features, and yet people were able to learn the\nassociations between object shape and object name. One way of reconciling\nthis with the hierarchical organization of the three representational domains\nwould be to argue that the particular circumstances of the present study caused\nparticipants to draw on aspects of the visual cognitive system that are not nor-\nmally involved in object processing. However, since it is not uncommon for\npeople to learn object names before they have an appreciation of the functional\nand associative significance of the objects, the circumstances of the present\nstudy may not be especially unusual. A second way of reconciling the semanti-\ncally impoverished nature of the objects used here with models of object pro-\ncessing would be to assume that information flows through successive\nrepresentational domains in cascade, rather than in a discrete fashion where\nprocessing in one domain does not begin until processing in preceding domains\nis complete. Having made this assumption in relation to their IAC model,\nHumphreys et al. indicate that it is not necessary for all semantic knowledge to\nbe retrieved in order for naming to take place. So that, for example, for an object\nsharing very few structural features with other members of its category, there\nmay be very little semantic activation prior to naming, giving the impression\nthat object naming is being directly driven by object structure. On this basis, the\nOBJECT SHAPE\u2013NAME LINKS 623\nnovel objects used in the present study qualify as candidates for relatively direct\nnaming since, by definition, they are structurally dissimilar from any objects in\nexisting categories. Thus, to propose that structural descriptions and name\ncodes can be reciprocally and closely linked may not be incompatible with hier-\narchical models of object processing, like IAC, in which semantic representa-\ntions are able to intervene.\nNOTES\n(1) Enns (1992) discusses the visual processes that recover the global, 3D structure of objects\nfrom line drawings. Refering to Enns and Rensink\u2019s PRISM model (1991), he argues that early\nvisual processes derive local estimates for the segmentation of object parts (from T-junctions) and\nfor the 3D orientations of surfaces that meet at convex and concave corners (from arrow- and Y-\njunctions). He proposes that these estimates can be derived quickly and in parallel across the\nvisual field provided there is a relaxation of the strict requirements for validity that models of early\nvisual processing conventionally demand. For example, the crossbar of a T-junction might always\nbe interpreted initially as a boundary edge, even though it could arise from the accidental\nalignment of a surface with the line of sight. To deal with the occasional errors of interpretation\narising from relaxing the demand for validity, later visual processes are thought to complete a\nconsistency check across all regions to determine if, for example, surfaces are being assigned the\nsame orientation on the basis of different local features. Some of the evidence reviewed by Enns to\nsupport his proposals comes from peoples responses to line drawings of objects that yield either\nconsistent or inconsistent sets of local 3D interpretations, like the pictures of structurally possible\nand impossible objects employed in the present study. Of particular significance in the present\ncontext, Enns approach assumes there are processes sensitive to the consistency (possibility) of\nthe 3D interpretations being recovered from different parts of an object. On this basis, therefore,\ninvestigating the effects of object possibility should benefit our understanding of basic visual\nprocesses supporting object perception. The benefits should extend beyond the specifics of the\nobject decision task.\n(2) Ratcliff and McKoon (1995), and Williams and Tarr (1997) have recently questioned the\nidea that priming in the object decision task reflects the influence of representations of global, 3D\nshape that are recoverable for possible objects only. Most notably, Ratcliff and McKoon (1995)\npropose that the typical pattern of results from the object decision task arises from the combined\neffects of two influences. First, from a tendency for previously seen objects (whether possible or\nimpossible) to be judged \u201cpossible\u201d . And second, from a tendency to remember explicitly how a\npreviously seen object was classified at the time (as possible or impossible) and then to re-adopt\nthis classification as the judgement in the object decision task. Whereas for possible objects both\ninfluences encourage a \u201cpossible\u201d response, for impossible objects they work in opposition.\nRatcliff and McKoon explain the apparent absence of priming for impossible objects by arguing\nthat these two opposing influences just cancel each other out. Although the present study accepts\nthe main assumption underlying the original interpretation of the priming effect in the object\ndecision task (i.e., that a representation of an objects global, 3D shape is recoverable for possible\nobjects only), it is not dependent on the correct interpretation of this effect, which might well be\ntask specific. Nevertheless, it is perhaps worth pointing out that the evidence Ratcliff and McKoon\nprovide for their argument is not without its problems. For example, concerns exist regarding the\nappropriateness of the pictures used in their experiments (see Williams & Tarr, 1997), and about\nwhat their participants explicitly remembered about the pictures from the study phase of the object\ndecision task. When Ratcliff and McKoon asked a group of people to judge whether each of their\npictures depicted a possible or an impossible object, and gave them unrestricted viewing in order\n624 WALKER, DIXON, SMITH\nto arrive at a decision, their performance was unimpressive. Only 78% agreed that the possible\nobjects were possible, and only 76% agreed that the impossible objects were impossible. One can\nonly wonder how many participants in the first phase of Ratcliff and McKoon\u2019s experiments\nspontaneously became aware of the possible/impossible status of each picture when they were\nconcentrating on judging the overall orientation of each object and had not been informed about\nstructural possibility as an aspect of the drawings. Uncertainty about the status of each picture is\nheightened by the very low levels of performance observed in the object decision task itself. For\nexample, the participants in Ratcliff and McKoon\u2019s sixth experiment seemed unable to decide that\nthe impossible pictures were impossible, their responses being fairly evenly split across the\n\u201cpossible\u201d and \u201cimpossible\u201d categories. With these reservations, it is not clear just what Ratcliff\nand McKoon\u2019s participants were explicitly remembering about the pictures from the study phase.\nNot only is it unclear how they interpreted each picture at study, it is also unclear if these\ninterpretations were then remembered. Despite the important role that explicit memory for the\nstudy pictures plays in their proposals, Ratcliff and McKoon relied on indirect and unconfirmed\nattempts to manipulate explicit remembering. And indeed, as a counter to Ratcliff and McKoon\u2019s\nproposals, Schacter and Cooper (1995) make much of the fact that in their own experiments\nexplicit memory for the study pictures varied significantly across conditions, yet the pattern of\npriming effects in the object decision task remained unchanged.\nWilliams and Tarr (1997) endeavoured to clarify and extend the concept of bias in the object\ndecision task. They offer a different explanation for the priming that occurs, but in doing so they\ntoo deny any role for a unitary representation of a possible objects global, 3D shape. Instead, they\npropose that people performing the object decision task analyse the different portions of an object\nseparately from each other. Priming in the task is then seen to reflect facilitated encoding of\nstructurally possible portions when they are re-encountered by the participant. By arguing that\npriming is confined to possible portions (because it is based on the recovery of coherent 3D\ndescriptions) their approach is similar to the original explanation of why priming in the object\ndecision is restricted to possible objects (see Cooper & Schacter, 1992). The fundamental\ndifference between the two approaches revolves around the issue of whether a whole object can\nsometimes be treated as a portion in the Williams and Tarr sense. Various factors might determine\nthe scale at which structural portions are segregated, and the complexity of an object might be one\nof these. For objects that are complex (perhaps because they comprise a larger number of\nconstituent geons) it might be difficult to sustain analysis at a global level. This also might be the\ncase when participants have to distinguish between possible and impossible objects that have the\nsame global configuration and differ only in the structural possibility of an individual portion/\ngeon (see Williams & Tarr, 1997). We would contend that the possible objects devised for the\npresent study were simple enough for processing to be initiated and sustained at a global level. If\nso, then, as Enns (1992) points out, a discrepant 3D feature in a line drawing of an object can be\ninterpreted as discrepant only in the context of the interpretations of other, neighbouring 3D\nfeatures. For a relatively simple object this would mean that the whole object is likely to qualify as\na portion in the Williams and Tarr sense. Further work is needed to clarify the factors determining\nthe different levels at which objects are attended and represented, and the scale at which\npossibility/impossibility is interpreted. At this stage, however, we believe that interpretations of\nstructural possibility can emerge in relation to representations of the 3D shape of whole objects.\nREFERENCES\nBaddeley, A.D. (1990).
