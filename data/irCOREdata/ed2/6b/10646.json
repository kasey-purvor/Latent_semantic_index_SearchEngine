Given that \nattitudes can develop early and be difficult to change, it is important for teachers of \nyounger children to know how to foster engagement in science. This study identified \nwhat a cohort of 79 pre-service teachers in England considered to be engaging \nelementary science lessons and compared their notions with teacher behaviours \nknown to be conducive to engagement. First, all brought beliefs about how to engage \nchildren in science lessons to their training. They tended to favour children\u201fs hands-\non activity as an effective means of fostering attentive participation in learning \nalthough many had additional ideas. Nevertheless, the means and ends of their \n\u201epedagogies of engagement\u201f tended to be simple and narrow. Trainers need to ensure \nthat notions of engagement are wide enough to cope with a variety of teaching \nsituations, as when hands-on experience is not feasible, effective or appropriate. At \nthe same time, teachers will need to recognise that one approach may not suit all \nlearners. Without this, there is the risk that they will lack the skills to engage children \nin science. Nevertheless, these beliefs could offer a useful starting point for trainers \nwho wish to widen pre-service teachers\u201f conceptions of engagement and increase \ntheir repertoire of teaching behaviours. \n \nKeywords: \nPedagogies of engagement, teachers\u201f conceptions, fostering engagement in science. \n \nTeachers\u201f notions of engaging science  \n 3 \nEngaging science: pre-service primary school teachers\u2019 notions of engaging \nscience lessons. \nIntroduction \nPartridge (1957, p. 350) described engagement as an \u201cintellectual\u201fs vogue \nword\u201d of the 1940s meaning involvement in a \u201cnot too strenuous course of action\u201d. \nSince then it has been used to describe, amongst other things, responses to school in \ngeneral and, more narrowly, to school subjects individually. In at least the last respect, \nengagement can be mentally strenuous. We begin by exploring some aspects of \nengagement in the context of science and describe teaching behaviours thought to \nsupport it. Pre-service teachers\u201f beliefs about such behaviours matter as they can \nimpede their training and perpetuate ineffective and inappropriate practices \n(Burkhardt, Fraser & Ridgeway, 1990; Pajares, 1992). Accordingly, we describe a \nstudy of pre-service teachers\u201f notions of engaging science lessons and some \nimplications for their training. \nEngagement \nIn science education, at least two meanings of engagement can usefully be \ndistinguished. In the first, engagement refers to an involvement in a specific event, \nsuch as a lesson. The duration and quality of the involvement can vary with person \nand event. In the second, engagement (more commonly, disengagement) refers to a \ntendency to respond in a particular way to science-related events. Disengagement can \nbe the label for an indifferent or inimical response towards learning science which \nresults in an avoidance of it when possible (Osborne et al., 2003; Goodwin, 2006; \nNiemi, 2007; Rocard et al., 2007). Engagement in the first sense is a particular act; in \nthe second, it is an attitude or tendency to act. The two are not independent: Millar \n(2001) points to the enduring effect of school science lessons on attitudes and Murphy \nTeachers\u201f notions of engaging science  \n 4 \nand Beggs (2003, 2005) suggest that when primary school teachers fail to make \nlearning engaging (as, for instance, when they prepare children at length for \nattainment tests) an enthusiasm for science wanes. In short, acts shape tendencies. Of \ncourse, experience of engagement in science is not the only shaper of attitudes; a \nmasculine image of a science, for instance, is a strong determinant of career choice \namong adolescents, even repelling girls who find science interesting (Osborne et al., \n2003; Jenkins, 2005).  \nAttempts to engage people in science have various purposes. For example, one \nis to persuade them to a point of view or to develop a favourable attitude in order to \nenlist their support. Another is to enable participation in science-related debate to \nimprove the quality of democratic decision-making (Millar, 2001; Leshner, 2003; \nWilsdon & Willis, 2004; Wellcome Trust, 2006; Boon, 2006). Yet another is to \nsupport attempts to develop someone\u201fs knowledge of science as a part of his or her \neducation. These are not mutually exclusive but the first two tend be the goals of \norganisations which communicate with the public in order to \u201cmake more meaningful \nthe fact that \u2026 science is an ever-more pervasive way of life for all people\u201d (Leshner, \n2003, p. 977; Wellcome Trust, 2006). Engagement to support learning amongst the \nyoung is usually a more systematic and extended endeavour that tends to be the \nprovince of the teacher. While the role of science in society can feature in that \neducation, it is often not the main goal although it can be a vehicle for achieving it \n(Newton, 1988; Millar, 2006; but see The Royal Society, 2004).  \nConnell (1990), Finn (1993) and Fredricks, Blumenfeld and Paris (2004) \ndistinguish between cognitive, behavioural and emotional engagement. The first \nlargely refers to the kind of engagement which fosters a certain quality of thought, the \nsecond to that which induces participation in learning, and the last refers to \nTeachers\u201f notions of engaging science  \n 5 \nengagement which engenders pleasure. At first glance, this intuitively appealing \ndivision is attractive but the categories are not entirely distinct. For instance, interest \nis presented as emotional engagement. While it may excite emotions, it also directs \nand sustains attention, a kind of behavioural engagement which could lead to \nproductive cognition. One kind of engagement may, therefore, enter into or support \nothers. A more holistic view, on the other hand, sees engagement as a more integrated \nand mutually supporting whole with the potential to enhance attainment and attitudes \n(see e.g. Guthrie & Wigfield, 2000). At the same time, the effect of an approach \nwhich engages children is unlikely to be narrow, even if the intention was. \nStimulating interest by tying what is to be learned to the child\u201fs world, for instance, \nmay attract and focus attention, help the child make mental connections and offer \nsome emotional reward. A teacher is likely to value all these outcomes. A variety of \nsuch behaviours may be used to induce engagement in young children (Lanahan, et \nal., 2005). \nTeaching behaviours which foster engagement in the classroom \nAlthough the link is not always direct, teaching behaviours are commonly seen \nas being shaped by the teacher\u201fs beliefs about children\u201fs behaviour, thinking and \nlearning (e.g. Bell et al., 2000; Daniels & Shumov, 2003; Water-Adams, 2006). \nMestre (2005) uses the expression \u201epedagogies of engagement\u201f to describe a teacher\u201fs \nclassroom beliefs about behaviours seen as fostering engagement. Pedagogies of \nengagement may be more or less coherent, more or less sophisticated, and more or \nless conscious. Knowing the pedagogies of engagement of trainee teachers of young \nchildren is important for several reasons. First, there is a substantial body of research, \nincluding work with younger children, which shows that engagement (often indicated \nby the learner\u201fs time on-task) leads to greater attainment (e.g. Capie & Tobin, 1981; \nTeachers\u201f notions of engaging science  \n 6 \nMarks, 2000). This means that a teacher who engages children in science may also \nincrease their attainment. A second reason is that attainment keeps open long-term \noptions of science\/technology-related careers for such children. A third reason is that \nleaving a concern for engagement in science to the secondary school ignores the value \nof developing attitudes early (Silver & Rushton, 2005; Tytler et al., 2008). The skill to \nuse and change teaching behaviours so that there is engagement in a variety of science \nlessons is valuable. Teachers do not always have this skill (Murphy & Beggs, 2003, \n2005; Middlecamp, 2005) so learners\u201f engagement in an event suffers and their \npredisposition to engage with such events in the future is threatened. \nSome suggest generating engagement in science by selecting only content of \nintrinsic interest or of lower mental demand (Sturman and Twist, 2004). There is an \nethical objection to this if it produces a science programme which does not honestly \nreflect the nature of science (for an example, see Abrahams (2007) or Buckley (2008)) \nand it does no favours for those who are seduced into a scientific career or who must \nparticipate in democratic decision making about complex scientific and technological \nissues. Instead, a first approach should be to identify teaching behaviours which tend \nto generate engagement in a representative science programme commonly believed to \nbenefit rather than deceive the learner. When the limits of this approach are known, \nother actions may be cautiously considered. This view underlies what follows. \nFrom a study of classroom management in the USA, Capie and Tobin (1981, \npp. 412-413) report that teacher behaviours which foster learner engagement include \nmaintaining \u201clearner involvement\u201d and \u201cusing teaching methods appropriate for \nobjectives and learners\u201f, enthusiasm, \u201ecomfortable interpersonal relationships\u201d, \nsensitivity and opportunities for learners to participate. Regarding enthusiasm, \nBettencourt at al. (1983) took a group of teachers and measured the amount of \nTeachers\u201f notions of engaging science  \n 7 \nchildren\u201fs on-task behaviour (time involved on the task in hand) during teaching and \nin the children\u201fs follow-up work. They then trained the teachers to show enthusiasm \nand repeated the measures. The training increased on-task behaviour from 76% to \n87% during teaching and even more, from 71% to 86%, in the children\u201fs follow-up \nwork. Students also tend to describe enthusiastic teachers as outstanding (Bauer, \n2002). A more recent and comprehensive study of a class of 11 and 12-year-old \nstudents in an Australian middle school by Darby (2005) found two areas of teaching \nbehaviour to be important for engagement in science: the nature of instruction and \ninter-personal relationships. The area of instruction involved generating interest and \nsupporting understanding; that of relationships comprised teacher enthusiasm, \nproviding a supportive learning environment and making the children feel emotionally \ncomfortable or at ease. Arousing interest, for instance, is known from other studies to \nlead to better learning (Boekaerts & Boscolo, 2002; Krapp, 2002; Hoffman, 2002; \nMurphy et al. 2006). Similarly, a relationship between engagement and understanding \nhas been demonstrated (Chong, 2009). Although Darby is not explicit about what \ncounted as engagement in her study, it seems that her ethnographic approach was \nintended to be sensitive to quantity and quality of learning where views about the \nlatter were shaped by constructivism. Another ethnographic study by Olitsky (2007) \nin the USA was of 8\nth\n graders\u201f engagement in science. She found that interest, valuing \nstudents\u201f prior knowledge and providing a caring environment which enabled students \nto contribute without emotional risk were important (see also Turner et al. 2003). \nAgain, what constituted engagement was not made explicit but it seems like that of \nDarby.  \nThe outcomes of these studies have much in common. In particular, lessons \nwhich are likely to engage children in science are those which generate interest, use \nTeachers\u201f notions of engaging science  \n 8 \nstrategies which support learning, are given with enthusiasm, and foster a non-\nthreatening environment in which children can make valued contributions and can \nreceive support as needed. Olitsky (2007) added that interest in the subject is not \nalways necessary if learners want to be valued members of their group. These studies \ndo not discuss the independence of these behaviours (does one add to the effect of \nanother or do they interact?), their relative contributions (has one a stronger effect \nthan another?) or if a subset can be sufficient for producing a high level of \nengagement in science (say, interest and enthusiasm). The effect of teacher \nenthusiasm on engagement (as time on task) can be calculated from data in \nBettencourt et al. (1983). Its effect size for teacher-led discussion was 0.98 which \ncould be described as large (Cohen, 1988; 0.2 or 0.3 are commonly seen a small, 0.5 \nas medium, and 0.8 or more as large effect sizes, see also Borenstein, Hedges and \nRothstein, 2009). That for subsequent pupil work was even larger at 1.36. According \nto Capie and Tobin (1981), this engagement is likely to enhance attainment but by \nhow much is not known. In an unrelated study described by Waxman and Walberg \n(1986), the effects of students\u201f \u201emotivation\u201f and \u201eindividualized instruction\u201f on \nattainment were 0.34 and 0.32, respectively. \u201eClass morale\u201f and \u201ecooperative learning\u201f \nhad larger effect sizes of 0.60 and 0.76, respectively. Insofar as these are different \naspects of Darby\u201fs instructional and relational dimensions of engagement, it points to \nenhanced attainment. Nevertheless, the link between engagement and attainment may \nnot be simple. Engagement may vary in quality as well as quantity and a brief period \nof one kind of engagement could be better than lots of another for certain kinds of \nattainment. \nInstruments for assessing associated aspects of engagement in the classroom \ntend to include items which relate to these behaviours. For instance, Newmann \nTeachers\u201f notions of engaging science  \n 9 \n(1988), in the USA, compiled one to assess \u201ethoughtful engagement in the classroom \nin social sciences\u201f in which engagement was the time spent on-task in discussion and \nin mental involvement (indicated by raised hands, postures of attentiveness and \nstudents asking questions). Items for rating included the extent to which children\u201fs \ncontributions were used, their generation of ideas, and allowance for ability. In the \nUK, Thorp et al. (1994) offered an instrument to rate the \u201eindividualized classroom \nenvironment\u201f in the science classroom. It included the amount of teacher-student talk, \nthe eliciting of student views, the differentiation of tasks to accommodate ability, the \nusing of students\u201f ideas, and consideration for students\u201f feelings. Other learning \nenvironment instruments described by Fraser (1986) include provision for relevance, \nteacher support and friendliness. A useful caution follows from a study by Treagust \n(2004) who used such an instrument to explore views about learning environments in \nIndonesian schools. He found that those favoured by the teacher were generally not \nrated so highly by the students. Nevertheless, a review of adolescent students\u201f beliefs \nabout what motivates them to learn in the classroom described in eight European, \nNorth American and Australian studies showed students\u201f preference for collaborative, \ninformal activity drawn from the real world and an avoidance of appearing foolish in \nfront of the class (Smith et al., 2005). While some of the preference could be \ninterpreted as students\u201f desire to be economical with mental effort and opportunities \nfor off-task affiliation, it does again point to the importance of evident relevance and \ninterpersonal relationships. Environments, contexts and topics favoured by boys, \nhowever, may not be the same as those favoured by girls and preferences may change \nwith age (Burnett, 2002; Uitto et al. 2006). \nIn the classroom, these general descriptions of teaching behaviours have to \nbecome specific. Attention has tended to focus on generating interest. In theory, \nTeachers\u201f notions of engaging science  \n 10 \nbehaviours which address learners\u201f psychological needs or personal goals are likely to \ninduce interest (Newton, 1988, 2004, 2008; Deci et al., 1991; Krapp, 2002). Engle and \nConant (2002) challenged 10-year-olds to solve a scientific problem (how to classify \nwhales). The approach offered some novelty, autonomy, affiliation and the \ndevelopment of competence. A \u201epassionate engagement\u201f with the problem was \nobserved. Similarly, working with 8\nth\n and 9\nth\n grade students in Germany, Gl\u00e4ser-\nZikuda et al. (2005) tested the effect of a combination of teaching behaviours relating \nto the need for competence, autonomy, interest, affiliation and practical activity. They \nfound it produced engagement and more durable attainment than \u201etraditional \ninstruction\u201f. Simply using novel, physical objects in science lessons attracts attention \nand can generate interest (Valeras, et al., 2008). Teaching behaviours which foster \nunderstanding, a non-threatening environment and individual progress are known (e.g. \nNewton, 2000; Hanrahan, 2002) but, while their effect on attainment may have been \nmeasured, that on engagement has generally not. Presumably, some part of their effect \ncould stem from greater or better directed engagement.  \nThere may, of course, be children who engage in a science lesson in the \nabsence of deliberate attempts to induce engagement. They, presumably, find \nsatisfaction in the lesson without additional inducement. Others, however, may need \nthat inducement. It is these who need a teacher with a sound pedagogy of engagement.  \nAims \nThe key to maximising the likelihood of engagement in science is the \nteacher\u201fs instructional behaviour (Yair, 2000) and, in particular, whatever part of it \ncould be described as a pedagogy of engagement. Pre-service teachers may lack \nsomething which approximates to such a pedagogy and be unable to construct \napproaches likely to engage children, other than by chance. On the other hand, past \nTeachers\u201f notions of engaging science  \n 11 \nexperience of school, teachers and children may give pre-service teachers a pedagogy \nof engagement, sketchy, partial or otherwise, which guides the selection of \nbehaviours, even unconsciously but not necessarily in desirable ways. It would be \nuseful for teacher trainers to know the pedagogies of engagement their students bring \nto their course so they can consider the need for and nature of education and training \nneeds. Accordingly, in the context of primary school teacher training in England \n(preparing teachers of 5-11 year-old children), this study aimed to identify some pre-\nservice teachers\u201f notions of engaging science lessons and consider implications for \nteacher training.  \nMethod \nInstrument \nA questionnaire was used to elicit pre-service teachers\u201f notions about teaching \nbehaviours they considered to produce engagement in a science lesson. It asked them \nto \u201cthink of a science lesson you believe to be engaging\u201d, to provide an ordered \naccount of the events in it, to identify the parts which made the lesson engaging for \nthe children, and mark that part considered to be the most engaging. Accessing such \nnotions through a specific context in this way can relate more closely to teaching \nbehaviours than asking for generalisations (e.g. Strauss, 1993; Lunn, 2002; Beswick, \n2004). Eliciting general notions can be less informative as they do not indicate how \nthey might be interpreted or if the trainee can make them specific for classroom \napplication. Nevertheless, the trainees were also asked if there were other ways of \nmaking a science lesson engaging and, if so, to describe them. The questionnaire was \ncompleted in the first week of the pre-service teachers\u201f training course and took up to \n45 minutes to complete. Its completion was supervised and there was no collaboration \nor collusion. \nTeachers\u201f notions of engaging science  \n 12 \nThe pre-service teachers \nA full cohort of seventy-nine pre-service teachers on a course to prepare them \nto teach primary school children in England completed the questionnaire. In common \nwith most who want to teach in England, this was a one-year postgraduate course. The \nstudents were aged 21 years or older (mean age 23.6 years with some 51% being 21 \nor 22 years old). They held first (bachelor) degrees but only four of these were \nscience-based, the largest single group being centred on languages (English and \nmodern foreign languages). Others had history, geography, theology, social science, \npsychology and combined degrees. Nevertheless, during and after training all would \nbe required to teach some science in accordance with the requirements of the English \nNational Curriculum. None had received instruction in teaching at this stage but all \nhad observed some teaching in a primary school prior to joining the course. \nData analysis \nFollowing the procedure for identifying notions and conceptions described by \nMarton (1981), all responses describing teaching behaviours to produce engagement \nwere collected to form a data pool. For example, the pool contained, \u201celiciting prior \nknowledge\u201d, \u201cgetting out of the classroom to look at objects\u201d, and \u201cchildren can see, \ntouch and feel what happens\u201d. Half of the responses were sorted by the authors into \ngroups according to the kind of teaching behaviour which the trainees considered to \ninduce engagement. The process was iterative and continued until self-consistent, \nmutually exclusive groups and sub-groups were constructed, labelled and described. \nWhen this was achieved, all responses were allocated to these categories and \nsubgroups independently by the authors. The inter-scorer reliability measure, Cohen\u201fs \nKappa, was 0.83 (for which see Robson (1993); anything above 0.75 is described by \nFliess (1981) as an excellent outcome). A few differences in scoring were resolved by \nTeachers\u201f notions of engaging science  \n 13 \nfurther inspection and discussion. It can never be said that the list of groups is \nexhaustive. The procedure is usually applied to relatively small numbers of people, \ntypically between fifteen and twenty, and a few more may add new groups. Here, \nhowever, with 79 respondents, no new groups were found necessary well before the \nend of the initial joint sort.  \nResults \nThe most common area of science in the lessons was biology-related (33 responses, \ne.g. \u201cFruits and Seeds\u201d, \u201cAnimals and their Habitats\u201d), with chemistry and physics-\nrelated responses being roughly equal in second place (23 and 22, respectively, e.g. \n\u201cSoluble materials\u201d, \u201cElectrical circuits\u201d, \u201cLight and Dark\u201d; one response was not \nspecific). Such students can be more interested in biology than in other sciences, not \njust in the UK (Fairbrother, 2000; Osborne, 2003; Baram-Tsabari & Yarden, 2005) \nbut this uneven distribution could be a chance occurrence (\u03c72 = 2.38, 2 df) so was not \npursued further.  \nThree groups were found to accommodate the responses: Interaction \n(involving talk between people), Task (activities for the children which do not involve \ndirect experience of the scientific phenomenon or event under study), and Direct \nExperience (activities for the children which do involve direct experience of the \nscientific phenomenon or event under study). These groups and their subgroups are as \nfollows: \n1. Interaction \nTeacher (T): The teacher elicits or provides information which bears upon the topic in \nhand (e.g. \u201celiciting prior knowledge\u201d, \u201cchildren listening carefully\u201d, \u201casking \nchildren [questions about what they are doing]\u201d.   \nTeachers\u201f notions of engaging science  \n 14 \nChildren (C): The children discuss with one another some aspect of the topic in hand \n(e.g. \u201cchildren share ideas\u201d, \u201ccollaborative talk\u201d, \u201cpupils generate new ideas \nand share these\u201d, \u201cworking in a group\u201d, \u201cteam work\u201d. \n2. Task \nFinding\/Developing knowledge (F\/D): The children are set the task of acquiring \ninformation vicariously as from books, software, the Internet, video \nrecordings, or they have the task of developing or consolidating knowledge \nsimilarly by, for instance, using games, simulations, quizzes, model making in \norder to illustrate a phenomenon (e.g. \u201cchildren play games to consolidate \nlearning\u201d, \u201cgetting children to be planets\u201d, \u201cApplying their knowledge to the \n[food] chain\u201d).  \nRecording (R): The children write, draw or otherwise make a record of their work or \nlearning (e.g. \u201cthe children like to draw to explain [what they did]\u201d). \n3. Direct Experience \nHands-off (HOF): The children observe scientific phenomena or events produced by \nothers (e.g. \u201cteacher lighting a bulb\u201d, \u201cgetting out of the classroom to look at \nobjects\u201d, \u201cteacher giving demonstrations\u201d, \u201cshowing real-world objects\u201d, \n\u201cthe class is outside\u201d, \u201cgathered around looking at real examples\u201d,  \nHands-on (HON): The children experience or use scientific phenomena or events \ndirectly (e.g. \u201cThe children are doing the testing\u201d, \u201cthey have to get the \napparatus and work it out for themselves\u201d, \u201cthey can do the experiment \nthemselves\u201d, \u201cmaking circuits from diagrams\u201d, \u201cchildren make decisions for \nthemselves [about what to do]\u201d, \u201ccarrying out an investigation\u201d, \u201cchildren \ncan see, touch and feel what happens\u201d, \u201cthey got to investigate for \nTeachers\u201f notions of engaging science  \n 15 \nthemselves\u201d, \u201cthe children were each able to use the thermometer\u201d, \u201cthey can \ndecide what to test with the magnet\u201d.   \nTable 1 \nThe frequency of all teaching behaviours stated as engaging and those marked \n\u201ethe most effective\u201f appear in Table 1. Hands-on experience (a subgroup of Group 3) \nwas the most frequently mentioned source of engagement and was considered to be \nthe most effective means by about two-thirds of the trainee teachers. For example, one \nresponse drew attention to the value of \u201cChildren able to carry out practical activity \n[making electrical circuits] themselves\u201d. One in ten added only variants of this source \nof engagement in both the lesson and in the more open opportunity subsequently. The \nmuch less frequent endorsement of Hands-off experience in which the child is a more \npassive observer of events indicates that it is not direct experience alone but a \nphysical involvement with the direct experience which counts. (If the groups were \nequally likely to be chosen as most effective then this distribution is unlikely to occur \nby chance: \u03c72 = 41.2, 2 df; p<<0.001.) Tasks which have the child actively collect, \ndevelop and record information and consolidate learning (Group 2) were also seen as \npotentially engaging. For example, in learning about light, one such task had children \ncut out pictures and sort them into sources and reflectors of light to be attached to \npaper for a display. About one in five of the trainees considered these tasks to be the \nmost effective means of engaging children. Teacher-children and children-children \ninteraction (Group 1), often in the form of talk about prior experience, questions, \nanticipated outcomes and ideas for action were commonly highlighted as sources of \nengagement although less commonly (one in eight) as \u201emost effective\u201f. For example, \none trainee highlighted, \u201cChildren sharing previous knowledge [about fruits and \nseeds] with both teacher and others\u201d.  \nTeachers\u201f notions of engaging science  \n 16 \nWhat did these pre-service teachers hope these behaviours would achieve? \nForty-two (52% of the sample) supplied answers. Nineteen believed it stemmed from \nthe generation of interest in the pupil arising largely from the relevance of the topic to \neveryday life (15) or from allowing the child some autonomy of thought or action (4). \n(For instance, interest was felt to stem from, \u201cmaking lessons meaningful to everyday \nlife\u201d or by demonstrating \u201cthe practical application of science\u201d and some autonomy \nis allowed by, letting he children \u201cchoose from a variety of materials and test what \nthey want\u201d.) Nine teachers referred to the value of \u201cfun\u201d and \u201cenjoyment\u201d and one \ndescribed the engaging effect of striving for competence in learning about electricity, \n\u201cWhen the light bulb lights up, they know they have done that themselves using \nelectricity\u201d. Five pointed explicitly to the motivating effect of activity, three to the \nteacher\u201fs enthusiasm and one to the engaging effect of understanding. Four others \nused the word, \u201emotivating\u201f, in a non-specific way. Clarification was sought from \ntwelve pre-service teachers chosen at random and interviewed individually. Their \nresponses centred mainly on direct and indirect experience as being engaging. One \nsaid, \u201cSo I showed them some photos [of] some birds covered in oil\u201d while another \nresponse was, \u201cPractical work, especially that the pupils can be involved in or do \nindependently, nearly always motivates children.\u201d When asked what is meant by a \nmotivating activity in science, they described it as one which generates interest. Two \nadded that it focused attention, increased task completion and produced more \nlearning. One added that a motivating activity was \u201cfun\u201d and two saw interest as also \ngenerating \u201cgood behaviour\u201d. These referred to the meaning of engagement as \nresponses in a given lesson. Interestingly, one student hinted at something more \ndurable, a tendency to act: \u201c\u2026 the desire to learn more about a particular topic\u201d. \nTeachers\u201f notions of engaging science  \n 17 \nEliciting beliefs in a science lesson context is intended to produce specific \nresponses rather than broad, vague generalisations. But it could have the effect of \nleaving some notions unsaid although an opportunity was provided to express \nadditional beliefs and was taken by all except one. Nevertheless, another ten pre-\nservice teachers also training to teach in the primary school were chosen at random \nfrom another cohort and were asked to \u201cThink of approaches to science teaching you \nbelieve to be engaging for children\u201d. They were encouraged to list as many as they \ncould. All offered Hands-on Direct Experience as engaging and rated it as the most \neffective (e.g. \u201cPractical work, active, hands on in all topics\u201d). Indeed, four listed \nonly variations of this kind of experience (e.g. \u201cChildren using equipment\u201d, \u201cClass \ntrips [with] field experiments\u201d, \u201cHands-on approach [in] museums\u201d). The others \noffered Interaction and Task teaching behaviours. The aim of these approaches was \nlargely to arouse interest (e.g. \u201cseeing real-life applications [of the science]\u201d or \nprovide \u201cfun\u201d. These observations broadly reflect the findings in the science lesson \ncontext and, like them, tended to focus on engagement in terms of attentive, hands-on \nparticipation.   \nDiscussion \nThe evidence points to these pre-service teachers having a belief in the \nefficacy of active participation in learning. Their responses generally related to \nbehaviours intended to induce children to contribute to a lesson through interaction, to \nbecome involved in a task, and to experience phenomena and events personally. \nHowever, it was engagement through hands-on, direct experience which was most \npopular. But hands-on experience is not always possible. Even when it is, it is not a \npanacea. For instance, Mant et al. (2007) made a particular effort to introduce \n\u201ccognitively challenging, practical, and interactive science\u201d into the lessons of 10 and \nTeachers\u201f notions of engaging science  \n 18 \n11-year-olds to enhance engagement and attainment. They claim an enhanced \nenthusiasm for and engagement with science and were pleased with the 10% increase \nin pupils achieving the highest level of attainment but their data allowed the effect \nsize to be calculated. At only 0.15 it hardly warrants the effort: it is possible to have \nengagement without attainment. Productive engagement needs more than a faith in \npractical activity: the activity should, for instance, catch and hold interest in the \nscience, support the construction of scientific meaning, and allow for individual \nsupport. Furthermore, gifted learners can be less motivated by hands-on activity than \nby something new and different (Rogers, 1991).  \nOf the 42 pre-service teachers who stated what the teaching behaviours were \nintended to achieve, 34 cited interest (mainly in terms of relevance to daily life). \nAmongst these, this interest was commonly associated with inducing attentive, \nsustained participation (a behavioural engagement which might support cognition). \nThere were also some who saw it as offering fun and enjoyment (in other words, \nemotional engagement). Of the engaging behaviours described by Darby (2005), these \nbeliefs touch usefully but narrowly on provision for interest and understanding. Both, \nfor instance, seemed to be seen in simple terms but, in reality, they comprise \ncomponents which may differ in their effect on engagement. Furthermore, their effect \nmay vary with the learner. For instance, the effect of teaching behaviours on \nengagement is known to vary with gender (Patrick et al., 1993) and a given behaviour \nis unlikely to suit all learners. Krapp (2002) has divided interest into situational \n(stimulated in an event) and personal (an enduring interest in science which \ntranscends single events) although he argues that these form the ends of a continuum \nranging from catching interest through holding interest to nurturing interest. Different \nteaching behaviours to catch, hold or nurture these kinds of interest may be needed. \nTeachers\u201f notions of engaging science  \n 19 \nAs Rivera and Ganaden (2001) point out, there is a need to match the approach and \nthe learner. Other engaging teaching behaviours described by Darby were rarely \nmentioned: support for understanding (other than that stemming from interest) was \nmentioned by only one person; a teacher\u201fs expression of enthusiasm was mentioned \nby three and none mentioned individual support or the development of an atmosphere \nconducive to learning. Similarly, there was no mention of behaviour which could be \ndescribed as inducing engagement through affiliation to a group in the way described \nby Olitsky (2007).  \nThese pre-service teachers are like many in other teacher training institutions \nin England and elsewhere (Newton & Newton, 2009) and so trainers may recognise \ntheir own students amongst them and relate these findings to them (for the concept of \nrelatability, see Bassey, 2001). While general and individual weaknesses regarding \nthese teachers\u201f notions of engagement in science are present (and to be expected, \ngiven that they are pre-service teachers at the beginning of their training), it is evident \nthat, as a group, the notions they bring provide potentially useful starting points for \ndiscussion and development aimed at widening their pedagogies of engagement. \nAlthough beliefs about effective classroom behaviours are not the only things which \nshape teaching, being able to change these when appropriate is at least useful (Hardy \n& Kirkwood, 1994). It is essential if they are to engage children in science - \nparticularly when novel, direct experience is not possible or appropriate - and so avoid \nthe effects noted by Murphy and Beggs (2003) when engagement fails.  \nHowever, trainers should be reminded that it is never certain that all relevant \nbeliefs have been collected. Those collected here are probably what come most \nreadily to pre-service teachers\u201f minds and so are likely to shape their attempts, if any, \nto engage children in learning science. Nevertheless, trainers may find other notions \nTeachers\u201f notions of engaging science  \n 20 \namongst their pre-service teachers. At the same time, those pre-service teachers who \ncited hands-on, direct experience as the \u201emost effective\u201f means of inducing \nengagement, often also mentioned a teaching behaviour in one of the other groups. \nThis extra behaviour, however, never usurped hands-on, direct experience as the main \nevent. Instead, it was used to introduce or round-off that direct experience. \nNevertheless, its existence means that at least some might try another teaching \nbehaviour when direct experience is not feasible. Perhaps through case studies, \ntrainers may find it useful to show how such behaviours could become strong \nalternatives that introduce variety and provide for individual inclinations. Finally, \nwhile we found it meaningful to capture the essence of the responses in the three \ncategories, Interaction, Task and Direct Experience, and their subgroups, others may \nhave divided the data pool differently. Those inferred here relate readily to \nmeaningful classroom behaviours of talking about the topic, setting learning tasks for \nthe children and providing experience of phenomena and events and so can usefully \ninform discussion about classroom practices and the questions we asked.  \nGiven the backgrounds of pre-service teachers, the trainers\u201f attention is often \non possible deficiencies in their scientific knowledge and understanding. But, as far as \nengagement is concerned, having a strong knowledge of science does not, in itself, \nguarantee the making of a good teacher of science. In fact, Kind (2009) has shown \nthat those who begin with a relatively weak knowledge of a topic can produce \neffective science lessons; such students tend to see the task from the learner\u201fs \nperspective. One of the trainer\u201fs goals is to widen this empathy to encompass a broad \nunderstanding of engagement.  \nConclusion \nTeachers\u201f notions of engaging science  \n 21 \nThese pre-service teachers could be said to bring pedagogies of engagement, \nalbeit narrow, with them to their training. The aim of their pedagogies was most \ncommonly that of gaining a willing, attentive participation in a science lesson. The \nmost favoured way of achieving this end was through a child\u201fs direct involvement \nwith phenomena and events. This notion is a useful one but, by itself, it has a serious \nweakness: hands-on experience is not always feasible, appropriate or effective. It is \nalso simplistic in that it may not recognise the complexity of engagement, the value of \nsupport for understanding (other than through interest), teacher enthusiasm, \nindividualised instruction and a supportive learning environment or that one kind of \napproach may not suit all learners (a one-size-fits-all model). Teacher trainers may \nneed to teach behaviours which contribute to engagement in these other ways and \npoint out that a favoured teaching behaviour may not suit all children. They may also \ndraw attention to the ethical dilemma of teaching only those aspects of science which \nseem to have an intrinsic attraction for learners.  \nThere is a need for further research into how to engage learners in science \n(see, e.g., Osborne, 2003; ASE, 2006). In broad terms, there are clear indications of \nwhat supports engagement but each item is itself complex and its effect alone or in \ncombination with others is not entirely clear. In addition, engagement varies in quality \nas well as quantity. Perhaps because quality can be more elusive than quantity, it may \nreceive less attention than it deserves. Regarding pre-service teachers\u201f notions of \nengaging science lessons, they can be narrow but teacher trainers do have something \nto build on. Furthermore, given the relatively limited scientific knowledge of some \npre-service teachers, the features of engagement could be used to give structure and \ndirection to training courses in science education (Newton & Newton, 2009).  \n \nTeachers\u201f notions of engaging science  \n 22 \nREFERENCES \nAbrahams, I.Z.
