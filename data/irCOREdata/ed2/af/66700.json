John Stubbs\u2019s controversial pamphlet against Elizabeth\u2019s proposed marriage with\nFrancis, duke of Anjou, The discoverie of a gaping gulf (\u0081\u0085\u0087\u0089), has conventionally been\nseen \u2013 with Edmund Spenser\u2019s The shepheardes calendar and Philip Sidney\u2019s letter to\nElizabeth \u2013 as part of a propaganda campaign organized by Leicester and Walsingham to force\nElizabeth to reject the marriage. Yet the evidence linking Stubbs with Leicester and Walsingham is\nthin. This article re-examines that evidence in the light of recent research on court factionalism, men-\nof-business, and concepts of counsel. It argues that A gaping gulf was an independent initiative taken\nby Stubbs which expressed very different attitudes to \u2018 counsel \u2019 from Sidney\u2019s letter. It suggests that\nparticipants in public debate need to be explored on their own terms, rather than as necessarily catspaws\nof councillors ; that there was an emergent Elizabethan public sphere independent of the court which,\nin holding different attitudes to counsel than councillors, could bring them into conflict with Elizabeth.\nThe execution of John Stubbs\u2019s sentence \u2013 to have his right hand struck off\nwith a cleaver for writing the pamphlet, The discoverie of a gaping gulf, against\nElizabeth\u2019s proposed marriage to Francis, duke of Anjou \u2013 shocked\nElizabethan spectators. According to William Camden, they were \u2018altogether\nsilent, either out of horrour of this new and unwonted punishment, or else out\nof pity towards the man being of most honest and unblameable report, or else\nout of hatred of the marriage, which most men presaged would be the\noverthrow of Religion\u2019.\" It also shocked Stubbs. Born c. 1541, the son of John\nStubbs of Buxton in Norfolk, trained and probably practising as a lawyer in\nLondon, Stubbs was confronted with the fact that his well-meant advice was\nperceived as seditious, if not treasonous, by the very person it was designed to\nhelp.# His scaffold speech suggests he was genuinely shocked that the English\n* I would like to thank John Guy and Kevin Sharpe for their comments on earlier drafts of this\npaper; Simon Adams for giving me the reference to Bibliothe\u2019 que Nationale, Fonds franc: ais 15973,\nand very kindly lending me his microfilm; Chris Given-Wilson for advice on medieval political\nliterature ; Mark Taviner for references on scribal publication; and Robin Harcourt Willams for\ntranslating the Latin in the Controlment and Coram Rege Rolls.\n\" William Camden, Annals, or the historie of the most renowned and victorious Princesse Elizabeth, late\nQueen of England (translated R.N.)

He could not help but comment on the injustice of the\npunishment : Elizabeth had refused to show him mercy (an essential of both\nkingship and queenship) though she had pardoned \u2018greater offences \u2019 :\nI ame sorie for the losse of my haund, and more sorie to lose it by judgment; but most\nof all with her Majesties indignation and evell opinion, whome I have soe highlie\ndispleased \u2026 I pray God it maie be an example to youe all that it being soe daungerous\nto offend the lawes, without an evell meaninge, as breadeth the losse of an haund \u2026 but\nmy greatest greffe is, in soe many weekes and daies of imprisonment, her Majestie hath\nnot once thoughte me worthie of her mercie, which she hath often times extended to\ndivers persons in greater offences.$\nThe scene on the scaffold in Westminster market place on 3 November 1579\nwas a significant moment in Elizabethan history, reflecting how Elizabethans\nperceived their political roles (especially in regard to counselling) and\nsuggestive of the relationship between court politics and public debate. The\nwork of Wallace MacCaffrey, Patrick Collinson, John Guy, and others has\ndeveloped our understanding of the culture of counsel and its centrality to\nTudor politics and theory, but problems remain.% Interpreting public debate as\nshaped by, or conducted on the behalf of, councillors either in parliament or in\nprint has meant the Elizabethan public sphere has been defined in narrow\nterms.& This has been reinforced by focusing on the work of committed\nProtestants articulating ideas of the \u2018mixed polity \u2019, even though Markku\nhistory of Great Yarmouth (Great Yarmouth, 1856), p. 339.

Part of the problem lies in that Elizabethan public debate appears\nthe poor cousin of its Jacobean and Caroline counterparts because the\ncirculation of newsletters, on which public debate is perceived partly to be\ndependent, was less widespread.( Exploration of public debate needs to be\nreleased from these restraints and this article attempts to help begin the process.\nStubbs\u2019s attack on the marriage in A gaping gulf was two-fold. He began by\narguing that the marriage of a Protestant with a Catholic was a breach of God\u2019s\nlaw which would be punished.) He proceeded to argue that the marriage would\nbenefit neither the state nor Elizabeth personally, in the process confuting all\nof the earl of Sussex\u2019s answers to objections against the marriage made during\ndebates among selected councillors in March and April 1579.* It would not\nresolve the succession or provide England with a strong ally. He thought\nElizabeth was too old to conceive and deliver a child safely while, because\nAnjou was at loggerheads with his brother, Henry III of France, the alliance\nwith France would not be assured. Neither could Anjou please Elizabeth\npersonally : he was too young, a Catholic, French, degenerate, and from an evil\nfamily.\"! Stubbs saw the marriage as a plot to destroy Protestantism\ncomparable to that of the marriage of Henry of Navarre to Marguerite Valois\nwhich had been followed by the St Bartholomew Day Massacre in 1572.\"\" At\nthe very least, it would be a precursor of the absorption of England into France\nbecause Anjou was Henry III\u2019s heir presumptive and it looked increasingly\nunlikely that Henry would have a male child.\"#\nElizabeth suspected that A gaping gulf was a collaborative work by opponents\nof the marriage at court ; a suspicion Stubbs himself appeared to substantiate\nby alleging that an unidentified councillor had foreknowledge of the tract but\n\u2019 Peltonen, Classical humanism, pp. 1\u201315, esp. 13\u201314.\n( F.

In conjunction with\nEdmund Spenser\u2019s The shepheardes calendar (also printed by Singleton in 1579)\nand Philip Sidney\u2019s letter to Elizabeth (allegedly commissioned by the earl of\nLeicester at a colloquy of friends and relatives at Pembroke House in August)\nit is argued that Leicester and Sir Francis Walsingham commissioned A gaping\ngulf to apply pressure on Elizabeth to reject the Anjou match.\"& They aimed to\nexploit existing court and popular opposition to deny her the conciliar support\nnecessary to gain parliamentary ratification of the marriage and to create fears\nthat its conclusion would excite rebellion. All three texts, it is argued, had clear\nfactional overtones : Stubbs openly questioned and impugned the motives of\nsupporters of the marriage; Spenser highlighted divisions between Leicester\nand the earl of Oxford (a supporter of the match) over policy and political\nservice in the fable of the Oak and Briar ; Sidney was directly involved in a\nquarrel with Oxford around the time of the Pembroke House meeting.\"\u2019 If the\nthree pamphlets demonstrated that some councillors were willing to try and\n\u2018bounce\u2019 Elizabeth into policy decisions then Elizabeth\u2019s reaction demon-\nstrated her \u2018 imperial \u2019 view of her own authority. If James Froude is to be\nbelieved, Elizabeth sought to execute Stubbs summarily by royal prerogative;\na scenario perhaps less surprising when one considers she took legal advice\nabout doing the same to William Davison nine years later.\"(\nJohn Stubbs\u2019s familiarity with the pro-contra arguments raised by councillors\nin conferences held in the spring and his ability to refute in detail points in the\nmarriage\u2019s favour made by the earl of Sussex, its leading supporter, were\n\"$ Mauvissie\u2019 re reported to Henry III that Elizabeth thought Stubbs, Page, and Singleton were\nsecretaries for those with evil designs : Mauvissie\u2019 re to Henry III, 9 Nov. 1579, Paris, Bibliothe\u2019 que\nNationale (BN), Fonds franc: ais 15973, fo. 202. In a petition to a privy councillor, present at his\nexamination, Stubbs argued \u2018before the matter was fownde out \u2019, the councillor had been able \u2018 to\nexamine and resiste, by timelie foresighte, any things that might fall out perilous to this common-\nwelthe\u2019.

But it has proved impossible to forge convincing connections\nbetween him, Leicester, and Walsingham. Susan Doran has rightly pointed out\nthat William Davison, the English agent in Antwerp, could not have been\nStubbs\u2019s mole as Mitchell Leimon argued: he knew Stubbs but was not a\nmember of the council and could not have been conversant with the details of\nthe debates. But her own claim \u2013 that Stubbs was supplied with information\ndirectly by Walsingham \u2013 cannot be substantiated.\") Similarly, there are no\ndiscernible connections between Hugh Singleton and Leicester other than\nthrough Spenser. Placing Sidney\u2019s letter in the sequence of events is also\nproblematic. Katherine Duncan-Jones and Jan van Dorsten have concluded\nthat the letter was probably written several months after the colloquy at\nPembroke House: the earliest suggested terminus a quo is November because\nSidney failed to mention it when discussing the marriage in a letter to George\nBuchanan in October.\"*\nDefining public debate as orchestrated by councillors also seems at odds with\nthe broader direction of recent research. Simon Adams has shown that the\nElizabethan polity was not characterized by persistent factionalism until the\n1590s ; a view reinforced by Paul Hammer\u2019s work on the second earl of Essex.#!\nThough this is disputed for the Anjou negotiations by Susan Doran, Adams\u2019s\nwork raises questions about how deep policy divisions between councillors ran\nand how they were articulated.#\" Second, while it is clear that men outwith the\ncourt were commissioned to write pamphlets in defence of government\npolicy \u2013 including Stubbs himself in 1587 \u2013 Thomas Freeman\u2019s recent work on\nThomas Norton\u2019s role in furthering ecclesiastical reform in the parliament of\n1571 has questioned the extent to which we can continue to understand the\nactions of \u2018men-of-business \u2019 in blanket terms: always council stooges, never\nacting on their own initiative.## Third, Anne McLaren\u2019s arguments that\nElizabeth\u2019s queenship was legitimated by utilizing a \u2018providential \u2019 model and\nthat \u2018counsel \u2019 became a more socially inclusive (though male-dominated)\nactivity raises crucial questions about the role of public debate in Elizabethan\ngovernance and the exact nature of Elizabeth\u2019s authority.#$ If England was, in\n\") Leimon, \u2018Walsingham\u2019, p. 124 ; Doran, Monarchy and matrimony, p. 167 ; Davison did not leave\nAntwerp until May 1579.

Reports from Sir Amias Paulet,\nEnglish ambassador in Paris, and the comments they provoked by councillors\nlike Sir Nicholas Bacon and Sir Francis Knollys, indicate that the central issue\non the mid-Elizabethan agenda was the unresolved succession.#& Mary\nStewart\u2019s imprisonment did little to allay fears about the threat she posed to the\ncrown: she remained Elizabeth\u2019s heir presumptive and, in Catholic eyes, the\npresent legitimate queen.#\u2019 There was also a strong belief that France and\nSpain were actively working to end the civil wars in their own territories in\norder to attack England.#( However, as Elizabeth aged, it became less likely\nthat the succession could be resolved dynastically as it was feared that\nElizabeth was too old to conceive and deliver a child safely, if she married.

Conditional on the duke also\ncontracting an alliance with Elizabeth, the Angevin-Dutch alliance also\nintensified the marriage negotiations, revived from their lacklustre progress\nsince 1572 by Henry III and Catherine de Me!dici in the spring: Anjou\nfavoured a dynastic alliance with Elizabeth.#* Fearing that Anjou sought to\nannex the Low Countries to France and believing that the alliance supplanted\nEnglish influence over the Dutch, the earl of Sussex argued that the danger\nAnjou posed eclipsed all other problems England faced. The marriage,\nhowever, offered Elizabeth the opportunity to direct Anjou\u2019s actions : the duke\nwould be her \u2018 servant & defender\u2019. This was a striking reversal from\nconventional understanding that all wives were subject to their husbands \u2013 an\nissue which, when applied to queens regnant, was hotly debated under both\nMary and Elizabeth.$!

Furthermore, Scottish (and French)\nagreement was essential to resolve Mary Stewart\u2019s anomalous position or to\nexclude her from the succession.$% The collapse of Morton\u2019s regency was\nperceived to open the Scottish access route ; a reading reinforced further,\nWalsingham made clear, by perceptions of Franco-Scottish relations under\nFrancis I.$& Consequently, men like Burghley were active in trying to repair\nAnglo-Scottish amity when the Scots provided an opportunity by sending an\nembassy under Robert Pitcairn, Commendator of Dunfermline and Secretary\nof State, in July.$\u2019 Focusing on Anjou\u2019s intervention in the Dutch revolt would\ndistract from these issues while not providing a suitable alternative resolution.\nDivisions over a dynastic settlement grew as the marriage negotiations\nintensified after the arrival of Jean de Simier, Anjou\u2019s Master of the Wardrobe\nand envoy, in January 1579. Though no longer emphasizing that it would\nresolve the succession dynastically, Sussex remained committed to the match:\nit would provide England with a strong ally ; to refuse the match would\nexacerbate political weakness as Anjou would marry the Spanish Infanta.$( On\nthe other hand, it was precisely the inability of the marriage to resolve the\nsuccession which reinforced Walsingham\u2019s and Burghley\u2019s opposition.$) Con-\nventionally identified as a supporter of the match on the basis of his pro-contra\nmemoranda, Burghley opposed it throughout the negotiations. Viewed in the\ncontemporary classical-humanist context of rhetorical devices to examine\nissues from different angles, the memoranda cannot be read simply as\nBurghley\u2019s conclusions. These have to be found instead in the advice offered to\nElizabeth of 13 April 1579 and his statement to the rest of the council on 6\nOctober : the latter clearly and categorically rejected the marriage, \u2018except hir\nMajesty wold of hir mynd inclyn to this marriadg, he wold never advise her\ntherto\u2019.$* If only because of the existence of similar memoranda, and reports\nof probouleutic (primary discussion) or conciliar meetings, these divisions\nappeared to spread.

It denied Elizabeth the\nsupport she required to push an unpopular marriage treaty through a strongly\nProtestant and hostile parliament.&( But there is no reason to dismiss the\ncouncil\u2019s message as disingenuous. Both Burghley and Sussex had explicitly\nrecognized that only Elizabeth could take the decision: in Sussex\u2019s words, \u2018her\nhart is to be gyded by godes dyrectyon and her awne \u2026 by cause no man can\nknowe the Inward dyrectyon of her harte \u2026 [neither] can eny man gyve\ncouncell therin, but leave that to god and her selfe \u2019.&) Marriage was a personal\nissue: as Elizabeth would have to live with Anjou, only she could decide\nwhether to accept his proposal. Proceedings of the privy council on 3 May\n1579 showed that councillors were concerned to have an opportunity to voice\ntheir opinions : this appears to bewhyBurghley deliberately ignored Elizabeth\u2019s\ninstructions that they discuss only the treaty articles and allowed them to\ndebate the match itself.

The same year he was returned as MP for Yarmouth.\u2019%\nHis friends were, likewise, politically active. Skinner and Hickes served as\nBurghley\u2019s secretaries and as MPs, both sitting first for Truro, in 1571 and 1584\nrespectively.\u2019& Moreover, Stubbs\u2019s circle was part of a wider one of men\ncommitted to active citizenship. As a political finishing school and stage for\nChristmas revels for the queen, Lincoln\u2019s Inn was an extension of the court ; it\nalso provided significant role models during Stubbs\u2019s stay. James Dalton and\nRobert Monson, for instance, were both senior members. Dalton was a leading\nlawyer and sat in parliament between 1563 and 1586, probably under the\npatronage of Bedford and then Burghley. Monson was raised first to the Court\nof High Commission in 1570, the post of serjeant at law (by special mandate)\nin 1572, and the Court of Common Pleas in November of the same year. Like\nDalton, he also sat for parliament under Bedford\u2019s patronage. The significance\nof Lincoln\u2019s Inn became acutely apparent in 1579 when both men openly\nquestioned the validity of Stubbs\u2019s sentence. Moreover, Dalton had already\nbeen joined on his Saltash seat in 1571 and 1572 by William Page, who\nattempted to distribute copies of A gaping gulf to the West Country via Sir\nRichard Grenville, and shared Stubbs\u2019s fate on the scaffold.\u2019\u2019\nParliament and Lincoln\u2019s Inn are crucial for understanding Stubbs. A close\nfriend of MPs Skinner and Hickes, and later an MP himself, Stubbs needs to be\nlocated within a parliamentary culture of counsel. Sovereignty lay in the\nqueen-in-parliament, and parliamentary consent (as representing the whole\nrealm) was required for all major political and religious changes, including\nmarriage and the succession. This doctrine derived primarily from Christopher\nSt German \u2013 whose Doctor and student (1528 ; a modified English translation,\n1530) and New additions (1531) were \u2018 set texts \u2019 at the Inns of Court \u2013 but was\nreinforced by both Sir Thomas Smith\u2019s De republica Anglorum (1583) and John\nAylmer\u2019s An harborowe for faithfull and trewe subjects (1559).\u2019( A petition Stubbs\ndrafted against Whitgift\u2019s subscription campaign against non-conforming\nPuritan clergy in 1589 demonstrates the extent to which he had absorbed these\nideas. He asked Elizabeth to appoint \u2018 such most honorable Lordes, and\nCounsellors \u2019 to alter or enforce more mildly the laws because the impending\ndissolution of parliament (\u2018 this corporation\u2019) meant it would be unable \u2018 to\nexplane & approue\u2019 remedial action itself. Stubbs and his fellow petitioners\nwere \u2018 fellow citizens and coheires as well of this earthly inheritaunce in your\n[Elizabeth\u2019s] kingdom as of that ever lasting inheritaunce in the kingdom of\nheaven\u2019.\u2019) In A gaping gulf, Stubbs made it clear that the importance of counsel\n\u2019% The stewardship was usually given to an eminent lawyer as it required the holder to execute\nthe judicial duties of the high steward and act as the corporation\u2019s legal adviser.

The purpose of political action was\nto benefit the common weal, defined as the preservation of Protestantism.(\" In\nA gaping gulf, Stubbs explicitly defined England as a Protestant, elect nation (\u2018a\nkingdome of light, confessing Christ and serving the living God\u2019) under attack\nfrom \u2018our popish enemies \u2019, the papacy, Spain, andFrance.(#Thoughmonarchs\nhad a prime duty to preserve Protestantism \u2013 they were \u2018 the sacred defender\u2019\nof God\u2019s church \u2013 as the petition of 1589 showed, parliament\u2019s role was\nequally, if not more, crucial. Lincoln\u2019s Inn had an additional significance.\nSince at least the fourteenth century, the Inns of Court had developed a strong\ntradition of political satire and complaint in poetry and prose romance,\nassuming a role initially held by ecclesiastics.($ This was an important literary\nmilieu for some of Stubbs\u2019s individual and collaborative works.\nIn the wake of Archbishop Parker\u2019s drive for conformity after the vestiarian\ncontroversy (1566) and the publication of the Admonition to parliament and A view\nof popish abuses (both 1572), Stubbs and his circle identified increasingly with\nthe reform movement that Parker\u2019s actions had pushed underground.(% In\n1568 Vincent Skinner had produced an English translation of Gonsalvius\u2019s\ndenunciation of the Spanish Inquisition, Sanctae Inquisitionis Hispanicae artes\naliquot detectae ; it was re-issued the following year with a dedication to Parker.\n\u2019* Stubbs, Gaping gulf, sigs.

These were polemical,\nlevelled primarily at Parker\u2019s hostility to the moderate Puritans\u2019 concerns\n(particularly preaching) and his defence of the episcopal structure in De\nantiquitate Britannicae. Parker was criticized as a poor and infrequent preacher,\nantipathetic to preaching as a whole.

Stubbs moved in a politically and\nconfessionally aware circle ; he was committed to an active public life, but\nunderstood its purpose to be the preservation of Protestantism. His com-\nmitment to Protestantism appears to have intensified in the early 1570s and he\nremained willing to express these views in print : his presumed collaboration on\nThe life post-dated his first appearance in print (A discourse \u2026 conteyning the life\nand death of John Calvin) by a decade.)! Importantly, his later works emerged\nagainst a background of religious tension: in the case of A gaping gulf, the\nhalting of Archbishop Grindal\u2019s reforms by Elizabeth both directly and\nthrough his suspension from office.)\" In conjunction with the nature of court\npolitics in 1578 and 1579, these suggest that, far from emanating from the\ncouncil, A gaping gulf emerged independently from an articulate, middle-\nranking, politically and confessionally conscious circle. Stubbs\u2019s friendship\nwith Skinner and Hickes may have been crucial and it is possible that they\nsupplied information from Burghley\u2019s archive of pro-contra memoranda to\nStubbs. Hickes was in trouble with Burghley over his service as secretary in\n1580, though there is absolutely no evidence to suggest that this was connected\nto any transfer of documents to Stubbs.)# But it would seem more appropriate\nto understand these dynamics in terms of a circle of friends or colleagues who\ndiscussed politics and, through their professional connections, could tap\nsurreptitiously into debate at court, rather than of a network exploited by\ncouncillors for propaganda purposes.)$\nThe history of the other men involved in the production and (attempted)\ndissemination of A gaping gulf seems to lend credence to this alternative model.\nMost important was Hugh Singleton, the printer, spared Stubbs\u2019s fate (the\nFrench ambassador alleged) because his age prompted Elizabeth\u2019s mercy (he\nwas about eighty).)% Singleton had started as a bookseller in Paul\u2019s Churchyard\nin 1548 but had employed other printers to print works for him until he began\nprinting himself, independently or with Joos Lambrecht, under false imprints,\npossibly in Wesel from late 1553.)& Early works were largely partisan and\ndominated by reformers like John Foxe and John Knox. Two crucial books\nwere printed in 1553. The copie of a pistell or letter sent to Gilbard Potter was heavily\ncritical of Northumberland and his attempt to settle the succession on Jane\nGrey. It defended Mary only as the rightful claimant by title under the terms\nof Henry VIII\u2019s will and made no comment on her Catholicism.)\u2019 Shortly after\n)!

It is more difficult to place Edmund\nSpenser in an identifiable political and religious circle than Stubbs and space\nprecludes an extensive evaluation, but there are important similarities which,\nif briefly outlined, are none the less suggestive. First, Spenser was also\npolitically active. He became secretary to John Young, bishop of Rochester (a\nfriend of Grindal\u2019s) in 1578 and had entered Leicester\u2019s household by October\nthe following year. In 1580 he became secretary to Lord Grey, lord deputy of\nIreland. After Grey\u2019s return to England, Spenser continued to hold a number\nof official posts in Ireland.*\" Second, Spenser was a committed Protestant ; an\naffiliation modern historians and critics have sought to play down.*# In 1569\nSpenser translated epigrams and sonnets for Jan van der Noodt\u2019s A theatre\nwherein be represented as wel the miseries and calamaties that follow the voluptuous\nworldlings, a widely circulated attack on the Catholic church.*$ Moreover, the\n)( Byrom, \u2018Hugh Singleton\u2019, p. 126 ; James Arthur Muller, Stephen Gardiner and the Tudor reaction\n(London, 1926), pp. 60\u20133, 224\u20135 ; Glyn Redworth, In defence of the church Catholic : the life of Stephen\nGardiner (Oxford, 1990), pp. 66\u20139.\n)) Freeman, \u2018 \u2018\u2018The reformation of the church\u2019\u2019 \u2019, passim. )* Commons, iii, p. 165.\n*!

Critics have de-emphasized Spenser\u2019s Protestant affiliations,\npartly because of the speculative nature of the identification of characters in The shepheardes calendar\nwith real figures, and partly the failure, by the first proponent of these ideas, Lilian Winstanley\nin 1914, to note Spenser\u2019s tenure with Rochester.\n*$ Hume, Edmund Spenser, pp. 1, 7. See also Scott Pearson, Thomas Cartwright, pp. 26\u20137.\n646 natalie mears\nMay and November eclogues in The shepheardes calendar replicated Stubbs\u2019s\nview of England as a \u2018godly realm\u2019 threatened immediately by Catholic\nconspiracy and, in the long term, by Catholicism and unreformed\nProtestantism.*% In both substance (the fable of the Fox and the Kid) and\nlanguage (his use of \u2018 fox\u2019 to denote secret Catholics and \u2018wolf \u2019 as open\nCatholics), Spenser drew on reformist works like Anthony Gilby\u2019s A pleasaunt\ndialogue, betweene a souldior of Barwicke, and an English chaplaine (written 1573,\nprinted 1581) and William Turner\u2019s The huntinge and fynding out of the Romyshe\nwolfe ([1544?]) and The hunting of the fox and the wolfe ([1565]).*& Finally, a\nconnection between political service and Protestant commitment comparable\nto Stubbs\u2019s is suggested by the date when the May eclogue was written. Though\nit is difficult to date with exactitude, there is a consensus that it was probably\nwritten while Spenser was working for Rochester, along with the July and\nSeptember eclogues which also commented on issues of ecclesiastical reform.*\u2019\nThese three elements seem to suggest that The shepheardes calendar emanated\nfrom the same milieu as A gaping gulf : the independent response of a politically\nactive and aware man with a strong Protestant conviction and a belief that the\nmarriage would not resolve the succession issue without creating far greater\nproblems. As Thomalin\u2019s emblem in the March eclogue stated: \u2018Of Hony and\nof Gaule in love there is store ; The Honye is much, but the Gaule is more. \u2019*(\nSidney\u2019s letter \u2013 and one written to Elizabeth by Sir Thomas Cecil in\nJanuary 1580 \u2013 was different.*) Sidney shared Stubbs\u2019s and Spenser\u2019s political\nand religious outlook. He defined England as a \u2018godly realm\u2019 under attack\nfrom Catholicism at home and abroad but argued that the marriage would\nonly aggravate the situation by weakening the loyalty of Elizabeth\u2019s Protestant\nsubjects and drawing Catholics further into disobedience. It would be a cure\nworse than the disease of the unsettled succession.** But he perceived the role\nof counsel strikingly differently. For Sidney, counsel was advisory \u2013 Elizabeth\nwas not obliged to accept proffered advice \u2013 and rooted in the traditions of\nnoble counsel (both humanist-classical, as articulated by Sir Thomas Elyot and\nThomas Starkey in the late 1520s and early 1530s, and feudal-baronial).\"!! For\nStubbs, counsel was socially inclusive and essential to queenship. He\nacknowledged that nobles and councillors were \u2018borne & chosen \u2026 fathers of\nadvise \u2019, but stated that bishops and courtiers in Elizabeth\u2019s favour had an\nadvisory role. More crucially, he also argued that he could offer counsel\n*% Edmund Spenser, The shepheardes calendar (London, 1579 ; STC 23089), fo. 12v (lines 57, 48),\nfo. 44 (Argument), fo. 46 (lines 133\u20137), fo. 19v (lines 215\u201320, 240), fo. 20v (lines 287\u201398) ; Hume,\nEdmund Spenser, pp. 21\u20132. *& Ibid., pp. 20\u20135.\n*\u2019 E.

Counsel was a necessary element of\nqueenship because queens, as women, were \u2018weaker vessel[s] \u2019 unable to\nexercise power independently and successfully ; they required counsel to guide\ntheir actions and ensure they acted for the \u2018common weale \u2019. In contrast to\nBurghley\u2019s and Sussex\u2019s statements, Stubbs argued that this applied par-\nticularly to the issue of marriage: \u2018how so ever sufficient it [her consideration]\nbe, so much the more hath she need of help, as the matter is more weightie in\nhir then in common matches \u2019.\"!# Stubbs\u2019s position was a major departure from\nconventional ideas of counsel and counselling. Though Aylmer and Smith had\nboth argued that counsel was a fundamental element of female monarchy, they\ndid not empower private citizens to act as counsellors identifying only the privy\ncouncil and parliament as legitimate fora for advice.\"!$\nThese different attitudes to counsel and queenship suggest Sidney\u2019s letter\ncontributed to a different debate to that addressed by A gaping gulf and The\nshepheardes calendar. Sidney\u2019s deference had more in common with the actual\npractice of counselling at court on the marriage issue \u2013 as articulated by\nBurghley and Sussex \u2013 than with Stubbs\u2019s harangues and invocations of the\n\u2018mixed polity \u2019. This seems reinforced by Sidney\u2019s social and political circle.\nWhereas Stubbs\u2019s milieux were the Inns of Court and their traditions of\npolitical satire and complaint, Sidney\u2019s were the court and the tradition of\nnoble counsel. As the political heir of both his father, Sir Henry Sidney, and his\nuncle, Leicester (until the birth of Leicester\u2019s legitimate son on 6 June 1581),\nSidney was groomed for political service.\"!% He accompanied his father to\nIreland in 1576 and undertook diplomatic missions to Emperor Rudolph II\nand Counts Palatine Ludwig and Casimir in 1577, when he also met Don John\nof Austria and William of Orange. He was subject to much advice \u2013 from his\nfather, uncles, potential fathers-in-law (Burghley, the first earl of Essex and\nOrange), his future father-in-law (Walsingham), and Hubert Languet \u2013 less to\ncreate a puppet or mouthpiece than to foster a wise head on young shoulders\nand enable him to fulfil his dynastic and political expectations.\"!& Moreover, he\nlived in a climate where young courtiers, like himself, strove to gain political\noffice as counsellors ; where privy councillors wrote letters of advice to Elizabeth\nwhen they could not offer counsel in person \u2013 such as Nicholas Bacon in\nSeptember 1577 and Francis Knollys the following January \u2013 and where\nElizabeth took or sought advice from household officials, agents, and\nambassadors who were not members of the privy council.

Where Stubbs and Spenser felt provoked to\nwrite in response to the failure of reform initiatives over preceding years and\nbecause they believed that the marriage threatened the future of Protestantism,\nSidney (and Sir Thomas Cecil) sought to contribute to probouleutic discussion\non the marriage and succession at court. Not selected by Elizabeth to discuss\nthe marriage during the spring conferences, and not members of the privy\ncouncil and so unable to contribute to conciliar debate in October, they\nresorted to letters, as Bacon and Knollys before them, to have their say.\nIV\nIt was precisely Stubbs\u2019s and Sidney\u2019s contrasting approach to \u2018counsel \u2019 that\nexplains why Elizabeth\u2019s reactions to the two works were so different : no\nproceedings were taken against either Sidney (or Cecil) and there is no\nevidence that Sidney\u2019s departure from the court in 1580 was related to his\nwriting the letter.\"!( As both the proclamation against A gaping gulf and the trial\nproceedings made clear, what incensed Elizabeth was Stubbs\u2019s presumption\nthat he and other subjects could offer counsel, specifically on issues \u2013 marriage\nand the succession \u2013 about which she had consistently attempted to restrict\ndebate in the privy council and in parliament. They also made evident\nElizabeth\u2019s anger with Stubbs for impugning her political judgement and\nability to rule. First, the proclamation denied Stubbs legitimacy as a\ncounsellor \u2013 he only \u2018pretendeth\u2019 to be one \u2013 because he was not specifically\nchosen by Elizabeth to act in an advisory capacity. Second, A gaping gulf\nwas explicitly condemned for \u2018offering to every most meanest person of\njudgement \u2026 authorite to argue and determine, in every blinde corner, at\ntheir several willes, of the affaires of publique estate \u2019.

If it is accepted that Stubbs was\nnot supplied with information from the court, then the knowledge he displayed\nof, for instance, French politics also suggests that the circulation of news and\ninformation was not dependent on the existence of newsletters and that, among\narticulate Elizabethans, its spread was more fully realized than extant evidence\nmight suggest. Further, it also seems that the public sphere was more diverse\nand varied than previously thought: the three texts were not consciously\nproduced to form a co-ordinated debate ; they were driven by different\nmotivations, drew on different traditions, and, in the case of Sidney\u2019s letter,\nwritten at some remove from A gaping gulf and The shepheardes calendar.\"\"%\nFinally, the role of the public sphere could be a matter of conflict between men\nlike Stubbs and Elizabeth \u2013 Stubbs saw it as a legitimate forum for political\ndebate and advice ; Elizabeth did not \u2013 partly because concepts of counsel\nconflicted on issues like the role of counsel and the status of counsellors.\nBut A gaping gulf raises as many questions as it answers. How typical was\nStubbs, either in his ideas on counsel, his perception of events, or the way he\narticulated them? How important was debate in print to the emergent public\nsphere compared to other means of articulation (for example, plays, ballads,\nalehouse gossip)? It is conceivable that Stubbs was (informally) supplied with\nmemoranda by his friends Hickes and Skinner, though equally he could have\nlearned of the substance of debate at court through the ordinary chatter among\nhis friends. How do these networks of communication help us understand the\ncirculation of news and the emergence of a public sphere? We are already\naware of the role of traders, travellers, and others in spreading news and\nrumours into the provinces ; to what extent might an exploration of informal\nnetworks of friends, colleagues, and acquaintances enable us to draw together\ndebates among articulate Londoners and, say, servants in Essex?\"\"& And to\nwhat extent can some of the blame for the expansion of counsel offered by\nsubjects be laid at Elizabeth\u2019s own door? Stubbs appeared genuinely surprised\nthat he had misjudged Elizabeth\u2019s openness to counsel, offered by a self-\nconfessed loving and loyal subject for her own safety and benefit. How much of\nhis mistake was due to Elizabeth\u2019s often, but perhaps rhetorical, courting of\n\u2018popularity \u2019? Did it lull her subjects into a false sense of openness?\n\"\"% Byrom\u2019s reconstruction of Singleton\u2019s printing activity in 1579 suggests The shepheardes\ncalendar may have been issued shortly after the publication of A gaping gulf.
