Although\nepidemiological and clinical research have suggested that\nHRT may exert protective effects on the prophylaxis of\nneurodegenerative diseases and beneficial effects on cog-\nnitive function, the Women's Health Initiative Memory\nStudy (WHIMS) contradicted these claims. The purpose of\nthis study was to reassess the effects of HRT on cognitive\nfunction in an attempt to account for two potential con-\nfounding factors that might have generated the negative\nclinical findings reported by the WHIMS i.e. subjects' age\nand educational level.\nMaterials and methods\nForty healthy postmenopausal women (private clinic\npatients; last natural menstrual period <3 years), matched\nfor age and education, freely consented to enter the study\nand were allocated in two groups according to their partic-\nipation in HRT (i.e. HRT group (n = 20) with an average\nduration of treatment >1 year without interruption since\nmenopause and non-HRT group (n = 20). Neuropsycho-\nlogical testing included tests of verbal declarative memory\n(California Verbal Learning Test), attention and concen-\ntration (Digit Vigilance Test) and problem solving ability\n(Matchstick problem). General functions and compara-\nbility of the groups were assessed by a family, past-medi-\ncal and gynaecological history.\nResults\nNo statistically significant differences between the groups\nwere observed for the digit vigilance test (attention and\nconcentration) and the matchstick problem (problem\nsolving ability). However, the scores obtained through the\nimmediate and delayed components of the memory tests\nrevealed a statistically significant better performance in\nthe group of women treated with HRT where fewer errors\nwere recorded.\nDiscussion\nThe existing evidence supports that HRT use is associated\nwith improved verbal declarative memory in healthy rela-\ntively recent postmenopausal women. Conversely, no\neffect of HRT has been observed on attention, concentra-\ntion and problem solving ability. Finally, the negative\nresults published by the WHIMS could be possibly attrib-\nuted to subjects' age and educational level that might have\nacted as confounding factors for maintaining cognitive\nperformance.\nReferences\n1.
