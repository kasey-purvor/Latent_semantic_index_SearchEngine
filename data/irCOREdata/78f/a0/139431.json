Whilst abundant fouling data is available, as 85 \nwell studies of the impact and\/or optimisation of physical cleaning for fouling amelioration 86 \n(Lodge and Judd, 2004; Katsoufidou et al, 2005; Smith et al., 2006, van der Ven, 2008), 87 \nstudies of chemical cleaning of membranes in the municipal water sector are much less 88 \ncommon. 89 \nEarly studies into optimisation of membrane cleaning qualitatively modelled the relationship 90 \nbetween cleaning regime and recovery for single foulants (Bartlett et al.  1995). These studies 91 \nwere developed from Hermia\u2019s blocking model, where foulants form resistance layers 92 \n(Belfort et al., 1994).  Further studies into quantifying the effects of chemical cleanants have 93 \nbeen used predominantly in food and industrial applications  (Shorrock and Bird, 1998, 94 \nBlanpain-Avet et al., 2004). Observations of cleaning effects with surrogate foulants in 95 \nlaboratory experiments show differences in cleaning effects and efficiencies for different 96 \nsolutions (Field et al.  2008). Dead end hollow fibre (HF) membrane cleaning studies on 97 \nfibres from a single field source showed the impact of cleaning reagents to be dependent on 98 \nfoulant character (Strugholtz et al., 2005). Recently models have been developed 99 \ninvestigating dynamic cleanant performance on membranes fouled with surface waters at 100 \nhigh organic loads (Zondervan and Roffel, 2007). Economic simulations based on 101 \nultrafiltration (UF) have suggested that optimising the number of cleaning cycles does not 102 \nreduce operating costs, and that cleaning should instead be optimised to control fouling 103 \n(Lodge and Judd, 2004; Zondervan and Roffel, 2008b).  104 \nFactorial analysis using analysis of variance has been shown to identify and optimise 105 \ncleaning with proprietary reagents, specifically on spiral wound ultrafiltration and reverse 106 \nosmosis membranes fouled from wastewater recovery duties (Chen et al., 2003). Recent 107 \nchemical cleaning optimisation studies based on hollow fibre UF and MF (microfiltration) 108 \nmembranes sampled from full scale potable water treatment plants have quantified optimum 109 \npermeability recovery from chemical cleaning of hollow fibre (HF) and capillary tube (CT), 110 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n5 \n \nrespectively representing shell-side to lumen-side and lumen-side to shell-side flow, 111 \nsubmerged and pumped membranes (Porcelli et al, 2009ab). The method for these latter 112 \nstudies was based on three factorial analyses using a response surface methodology, Box 113 \nBehnken Determination (BBD), and has yielded algorithms quantifying the variation in 114 \npermeability recovery from cleaning as a function of the key cleaning parameters of 115 \nconcentration (C), temperature (T) and soak period (P).  The experimental method (Porcelli et 116 \nal, 2009a) has allowed optimum values of C, P and T to be identified for membranes 117 \npertaining to a range of plants, cleaning protocols, operating conditions and feed qualities 118 \n(Porcelli et al, 2009b). 119 \nIn the following paper the results from a cost model based on the simplest representation of 120 \nfouling, as resistances in series (Belfort et al., 1994; Zondervan et al., 2008), are presented 121 \nbased on previously published data (Porcelli et al, 2009b).  The model has been applied to 122 \nfour full-scale, established MF\/UF potable plants selected to provide a range of membrane 123 \nmaterial types and configurations, water sources, pre-treatment, fouling conditions and 124 \ncorresponding operation and maintenance conditions, with the latter particularly relating to 125 \nthe chemical cleaning regimes.  126 \nMethodology 127 \nSampled membrane plants 128 \nCost models for a number of cleaning operational scenarios were built from cleaning factor 129 \nrelationships generated from permeability recovery data from laboratory cleaning 130 \noptimisation tests (Porcelli et al, 2009ab). Figure 1 shows the information flows to a transient 131 \nheadloss (\u2206P) or Trans Membrane Pressure (TMP) model built from site and laboratory data. 132 \nThe factorial algorithms from cleaning experiments allowed four cleaning scenarios to be 133 \nexplored for four membrane potable water treatment sites (A-D, Table 1) with another four 134 \nscenarios for variation in operational strategy, yielding 64 data in all. Operational costs over a 135 \nyear were calculated from energy and chemicals consumption and waste generation. 136 \nTable 1 Operational and membrane data from Sites A-D 137 \n 138 \nFigure 1 Cleaning variation cost model methodology  139 \nThe HF membranes sampled from the primary stage of each of the four sites were 140 \npolyethersulphone (PES) ultrafiltration; polypropylene (PP) pumped system microfiltration 141 \nand polyvinyldiethylene (PVDF), with one site having a submerged configuration and the 142 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n6 \n \nother pumped. Modules were extracted in a fouled state, prior to on-site backwashing and 143 \nchemical cleaning, and transported wet to the laboratory. Storage and autopsy of the modules 144 \nand permeability testing and chemical cleaning efficacy of the extracted fibres was as 145 \ndescribed in Porcelli et al (2009a). 146 \nGeneration of cleaning parameter algorithm  147 \nA bespoke rig was constructed to measure permeability at constant head of ultrapure water 148 \n(Porcelli et al, 2009a). Permeability was recorded before and after cleaning to allow 149 \ncalculation of permeability recovery (%Rv) according to: 150 \n%Rv = 100(Kf - Ki)\/(Kv \u2013 Ki)        (1) 151 \nwhere Ki and Kf are the measured initial and final permeability in L.m-2 h-1. bar-1, and Kv is 152 \nthe virgin membrane permeability.  153 \nFouled fibres extracted from modules taken from full-scale potable water membrane plants 154 \nwere rinsed before assembly into bench scale modules for cleaning and recovery 155 \nmeasurement (Porcelli et al, 2009ab). Fifteen trials were conducted in total, and %Rv 156 \nmeasured for a range of values of C, P and T (Table 2). The data were then used to generate 157 \nsite-specific algorithms from least square optima based on a two factorial model (Porcelli et 158 \nal., 2009b). The aim was to quantify the responses for each factor. 159 \nA 23-1 experiment with fifteen tests varying factor conditions was performed to a response 160 \nsurface Box Behnken design (Myers et al.  1989). Cleaning parameters were varied in the 161 \nmatrix in equal proportions, with the central points of each parameter repeated three times. 162 \nThe factorial multipliers (Table 3) from the computed responses from the CPT ranges given 163 \nin Table 2 generated two-factorial expressions specific to each plant: 164 \n%Rv = M + a*C + b*P +c*T + d* C.P + e*C.T + f*P.T     (2) 165 \nTable 2 Cleaning factor ranges for BBD experiments 166 \n 167 \nTable 3 Factorial algorithm components for sites A, B, C and D 168 \n 169 \nCost model basis and operation. 170 \nUsing the algorithms determined from the cleaning response experiments (Table 3) a simple 171 \ncost model was built to compute the impact of the cleaning factor envelope for each site.

The factor Xb was iterated such that the model permeability 184 \nrecovery replicated the experimentally determined value represented in the two factorial CPT 185 \nalgorithms summarised in Table 3. Historical TMP decline data from the full-scale plants 186 \n(Fig.2) were used to estimate the average annual rate of foulant build up between backwashes 187 \nand chemical cleans in place (CIPs) for the MF plants (B, C and D) and chemically enhanced 188 \nbackwashes (CEBs) for the UF plant (A).  189 \nFor each of the four sites the model generated the classic TMP \u201csaw-tooth\u201d transient (Fig. 3) 190 \nthrough appropriate scheduling of backwashing and cleaning and adjustment of Rf to match 191 \nreported site conditions. Following every backwash Xa was returned to zero whereas both Xa 192 \nand Xb were returned to zero following a chemical clean. Chemical cleaning was initiated in 193 \nthe model either at fixed time intervals or on reaching a threshold TMP. The pore fouling Xb 194 \ncomponent was iterated such that the permeability recovery (%Rv) equalled the 195 \nexperimentally-determined value generated from Equation 2 for each site (Table 3).

Nb and Nc also determine the volume of water wasted, the total 215 \nenergy demanded for cleaning (primarily for heating) and the chemical demand. Hence, 216 \nwhilst increasing the cleaning frequency maintains a higher TMP, this is to some extent offset 217 \nby the decreased production and pumping energy demand from membrane \u201cdowntime\u201d and  218 \nreagent heating.  219 \nFor each plant the model parameter values (Table 4) were collected from site and plant 220 \ndesign information.

These 225 \nrepresented the optimum permeability recovery (Rv,max), as determined from the bench-scale 226 \ntests (Porcelli et al, 2009b), plus three other scenarios representing ranges of CPT variation: 227 \nminimum cleanant concentration (Cmin); maximum soak period (Pmax) and minimum 228 \n(ambient) temperature (Tmin). These were used in the algorithm (Equation 2) along with the 229 \ndesign and operation data (Table 4) to generate the TMP transient.

A common notional waste disposal route was 276 \nassumed based on backwashing and cleaning waste volumes which were converted to energy 277 \ndemand using a common waste energy cost factor Cfw, adapted from (Zondervan and Roffel, 278 \n2008) and based on waste neutralisation and returning to the head of works: 279 \n 280 \n\u00a3w = Cfw (((Nc Vc) + ( QbNbtbb)) \u03c1 g \u0394h) \/ \u03b7               (10) 281 \n 282 \nThe cost variation in contribution from each cost group was compared for the different CPT 283 \nenvelope responses (Rv,max, Cmin, Pmax, Tmax). By converting total operating costs to relative 284 \ncosts per cubic metre of water produced it was possible to compare costs across the different 285 \nsites. The deviation from the optimum cleaning scenario for each of the operational scenarios 286 \ncould also be compared. 287 \nResults 288 \nCosts for each site were categorised according to headloss pumping, cleanant heating energy, 289 \nchemical consumption, backwash pumping and waste treatment. These are presented as 290 \npercentage of total operational costs, indicating the differences that each operational 291 \n\u201cStrategy\u201d provides, in Table 6. The operational cost of each operational \u201cstrategy\u201d at 292 \noptimal permeability recovery are shown in Figure 3; where error bars indicate the minimum 293 \nand maximum operational costs according to different CPT envelope \u201cscenario\u201d responses (I 294 \nRv,max, II Cmin, III Pmax, and IV Tmax). The percentage component contribution to the operating 295 \ncost, based on optimum cleaning recovery, is given in (Table 8) for a number of cleaning 296 \n\u201cscenarios\u201d. It can be seen that the cost associated with the TMP headloss represents the 297 \nprimary component in all cases and that, despite optimisation of cleaning, there is significant 298 \nvariation in calculated operational costs. 299 \n 300 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n11 \n \nFigure 4 Chart showing how optimal cleaning recovery (Rvmax) influences relative costs\/m3 of water for a 301 \nvariation in operational scenario (1-4, Table 6) The error bars show how this varies across the cleaning 302 \nfactor envelope (II-IV, Table 5).  303 \n 304 \nTable 8 Percentage contribution to operational costs based on optimum cleaning protocol (I) for the four 305 \nsites and the four operational  scenarios 306 \n 307 \nThe influence of the cleaning factor envelope variations on the unit cost (Figure 4) shows the 308 \nrelative cost variation across the ranges of recovery attained from the four cleaning scenarios 309 \napplied to the four operational \u201cstrategies\u201d chosen for the four sites. The calculated variation 310 \nin the plant life operating costs for each of the \u201cscenarios\u201d (Table 9) includes data for cash 311 \nflow using a discount rate of 10% and a 15 year plant life. For all the models the range of 312 \nvariation from treatment factors is seen to have cost implications which vary with operational 313 \nstrategy. The MF membrane sites (B, C, D) indicate increasing costs under optimal cleaning 314 \nconditions as the \u201cstrategy\u201d proceeds from a high fixed TMP (1) to a long fixed interval 315 \ncleaning cycle (4). For the UF plant (Site A) the wider range of costs for a fixed low TMP 316 \n\u201cstrategy\u201d indicates that frequency of cleaning operations together with the optimisation of 317 \nthe cleaning factors has the largest impact on operational costs.   318 \n 319 \nFigure 5 Chart showing relative operational costs (p, or \u00a3 x 0.01, per m3) for the four cleaning factor 320 \n\u201cscenarios\u201d (Rvmax, Cmin, Pmax, Tmax) for each of the four Operational Scenarios (1-4) on Sites A-D.  321 \n 322 \n 323 \nTable 9 Difference between best and worst case operational costs with cleaning factor envelope for sites 324 \nA-D for each of the operational scenarios 1-4: (i) operational cost savings  from variations in cleaning 325 \nfactors, with (ii) the equivalent capital cost for 15 year amortisation period at 10%. 326 \n 327 \nDiscussion 328 \nEvidence provided from the analysis (Figs. 3-4, Table 9) indicates a significant impact of 329 \nboth the plant operating protocol (i.e. the basis chosen for applying the chemical clean) and 330 \nthe degree of optimisation of the chemical clean (i.e. the attainable permeability recovery and 331 \nenergy\/consumables expenditure) on overall operating costs.  For example, for Plant C the 332 \nspread of the unit operating costs (\u00a3unit, in pence per m3) arising from operation across the 333 \nrange of the cleaning \u201cscenario\u201d ranges (maximim to minimum CPT values) is calculated to 334 \nbe as high as 0.2 pence.m-3 above an optimum of 0.3p.m-3 for a strategy of less frequent CIPs 335 \n(Fig. 4).  If the operating \u201cstrategy\u201d is changed to more frequent CIPs the operating costs 336 \ndecrease by around 10% and its cost variation for operation across the CPT envelope is 337 \nreduced by a third. As the cleaning \u201cscenario\u201d is changed, the impact of the cleaning 338 \nenvelope is also changed, with the largest impact - from 0.08 to 0.23 pence.m-3 as measured 339 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n12 \n \nfor Plant D (a submerged MF plant) on changing from operation at fixed high threshold TMP 340 \nto operation at less frequent CIPs (Fig. 5).  Moreover, there is a distinct difference in the 341 \npattern of behaviour between the UF plant (Plant A) and the microfiltration plants (Plants B-342 \nD), according to Figure 4. 343 \n 344 \nIt has previously been observed (Zondervan and Roffel, 2008) that optimisation of cleaning 345 \ncycles has little impact on the lifetime cost, based on models built for a UF plant scenario 346 \nwith varied cycle time for a particular set of parameter data. The current study, conducted 347 \nacross a range of plants, showed the cleaning response to vary greatly. This variation yielded 348 \nchanges in annual operational costs, relating primarily to energy and consumables, ranging 349 \nfrom below \u00a320k to over \u00a3170k for a UF plant challenged with pre-treated groundwater 350 \n(Table 4, Site A). This has implications regarding existing and proposed control strategies for 351 \nbackwash frequency and cleaning cycle control based on neural networks (Veerapaneni et al.,  352 \n2004, Oh et al.,  2004) based on cleaning efficacy attained on site. Such approaches, using 353 \nheuristic data for feedback control, are necessarily constrained by the operating envelope 354 \nused on site, whereas the approach used in the current study allows a much larger envelope to 355 \nbe explored and the optimum cleaning conditions precisely identified, though the approach is 356 \nconstrained by the necessity for ex-situ tests.  357 \nConclusions 358 \nThe effects of actual variable cleaning recoveries for different membrane fibres fouled on full 359 \nscale plants were appraised using a simple fouling model to generate a transient TMP trend 360 \nwith variable backwash and cleaning cycles. The effect of cleaning factor \u201cscenario\u201d 361 \nvariations on recovery from experimental data was incorporated into the model along with 362 \nplant operating \u201cstrategies\u201d, and the model used to quantify their impact on operating cost. 363 \nThe study revealed:  364 \n\u2022 Differences in cleaning factor performance, as determined by the values for the cleanant 365 \nconcentration C and cleaning temperature T and soak period P, were significant and have 366 \na bearing on the design of a process, and in particular the range of operating flux which 367 \ndetermines the fouling rate and so cleaning cycle times. 368 \n\u2022 Optimisation of permeability recovery has a measurable impact on operational costs, with 369 \nthe difference in annual operating cost between the most and least optimal chemical clean 370 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n13 \n \nbeing as little as \u00a35 to as high as \u00a374 p.a. per l\/s of flow depending upon the plant 371 \noperating protocol. 372 \n\u2022 The extent of the operational cost reduction for an optimal cleaning regime is dependent 373 \non both the operational strategy, with respect to the basis for scheduling the chemical 374 \ncleans, and the membrane type (ultrafiltration vs. microfiltration) and\/or configuration 375 \n(hollow fibre vs. capillary tube). 376 \nResults indicate that the innate variability in cleaning efficacy appears likely to eclipse any 377 \npossible correlation of permeability recovery with fouling characteristics. Clearly this aspect 378 \ndemands further study, given the wealth of scientific information on fouling mechanisms and 379 \nlinked with foulant physicochemistry and biochemistry. 380 \nAcknowledgements 381 \nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research 382 \nCouncil, who part-funded this work, and the industrial sponsors Anglian Water, Severn Trent 383 \nWater, Thames Water, Three Valleys Water, United Utilities and Yorkshire Water. 384 \nReferences  385 \nAlspach, B., Adham, S., Cooke, T., Delphos, P., Garcia-Aleman, J., Jacangelo, J., Karimi, A., Pressman, J., 386 \nSchaefer, J. and Sethi, S.
