A. Mirhadizadeh, E.P. Moncholi, D .Mba,  \nAbstract \nDetecting mechanical faults of rotating machines particularly in hydrodynamic bearings has been \nrecognised as important for preventing sudden shut downs. This technical note presents an \nexperimental investigation that is aimed at understanding the influence of operational variables \n(speed, load, etc) on generation of Acoustic Emission in a hydrodynamic bearing. It is concluded \nthat the power losses of the bearing are directly correlated with Acoustic Emission levels. \nKeywords: Acoustic Emission, hydrodynamic, bearing, condition monitoring \n \nIntroduction \nThe traditional definition of Acoustic Emission (AE) is an elastic wave produced as a result of \nswift discharge of energy from a source within a material that is compelled by an externally \napplied stimulus [1]. The first comprehensive investigation into the phenomenon of AE was \nundertaken by Kaiser in 1950 [2]. Kaiser was the first to digitally acquire AE signals produced in \nthe crystal structure of materials during stress tests. The AE technology is continually developing \ninto a complimentary technology for condition monitoring of machines [3] where most \ninvestigators applications have utilised the frictional phenomenon associated with AE. Acoustic \nEmission technology has advantages in comparison to other diagnostic methods [4]. Firstly, \ndefects are easier to detect because of improved signal to noise ratio and secondly, since it can \ndetect mechanical abnormalities at high frequencies, it is far more sensitive in comparison to \nvibration techniques. In addition Acoustic Emission is non-intrusive and is applicable on any \ntype of machinery regardless of speed. Through it must be stated that the application of AE \ntechnology does have its limitations [5]. In the application of AE to hydrodynamic bearings \n(journal bearings) Sato [6] was the first investigator that directly addressed monitoring the \nintegrity of such bearings. Typical problems that are associated with journal bearings include \nwear and metal wipe which is a direct consequence of the shaft making contact with the journal, \nsuch frictional contact is a prime source of AE. Other sources of AE associated with rotating \nmachines include impacting, cyclic fatigue, friction, turbulence, material loss, cavitations, \nleakage, etc [3]. Others [7-11] have applied the AE technology to shaft-seal rubbing in large \npower generation turbines. Leahy [12] undertook the most realistic controlled verification of \napplicability of AE to shaft seal rubbing where it was noted that a simulated rub on the shaft of \nan operating steam turbine could be detected with AE sensors mounted on the bearing pedestal. \nAl-Shaikh Mubarak [13] attempted to apply the technology for monitoring blade rubbing. Whilst \nin all the cases highlighted above the measurement of AE was taken at the journal bearing \nhousing no attempt was made to understand the factors that govern the generation of AE within \nthe bearing, particularly as the operational variables such as load, film thickness, and speed \nchange with operating requirements. \nThe aim of this investigation was to ascertain the relationship between rotational speed, applied \nload, theoretical film thickness, power losses, shear stress and AE for a hydrodynamic bearing, \nwhich hitherto has not been explored. \n \nEXPERIMENTAL PROGRAMME \nThe hydrodynamic bearing test rig employed for this study has an operational speed range \nbetween 10rpm to 5000rpm with a maximum load capability of 20kN.  Figure 1\t\r \u00a0depicts the test \nrig employed for this investigation. \n \nIn developing an understanding of the relationship between Acoustic Emission and the \noperational variables an experimental programme was developed which involved testing at a \nspeed range of between 750 to 4500 rpm and a load range of between 2KN to 10KN. The \nhydrodynamic bearing material was Bronze. The test bearing had a radius of 40mm, length of \n80mm and a measured radial clearance of 0.17mm. \n Figure 1 Test rig layout \n \nTo understand the influence of viscosity on generating AE, three different oil types were \nemployed. This included: \n\uf0d8 Alpha SP68, kinematic viscosity 68cSt and 8.53cSt at 40\u00b0C and 100\u00b0C of respectively  \n\uf0d8 Alpha SP220, kinematic viscosity 220cSt and 18.7cSt at 40\u00b0C and 100\u00b0C of  respectively  \n\uf0d8 Alpha SP460, kinematic viscosity 460cSt and 30.5cSt at 40\u00b0C and 100\u00b0C of respectively \n \nTwo Physical Acoustics WD type sensors with a frequency bandwidth of between 100 KHz to \n750 KHz were employed. Both sensors were placed directly onto the test bearing at each axial \nend (see figure 2) and connected to a pre-amplifier at 40dB gain. A third WD sensor was placed \non the loading arm, see figure 1. For all tests undertaken in this investigation the AE r.m.s values \nwere recorded over a time constant of 10msec and a sampling rate of 100Hz. In addition, four J-\ntype thermocouples were fixed on the axial end at the bearing in the loaded zone, and one K-type \nthermocouple was placed in the oil bath, see figure 2 .The thermocouples had an operating range \nof 0 to 200\u00b0C with an accuracy of \u00b11.5\u00b0C. Measurements of temperature were taken throughout \nall test conditions at a sampling rate of 10 kHz. \n \n \nFigure 2 Location of AE and thermocouple sensors on test bearing \n \nThis investigation involved varying the bearing rotational speed for fixed loads and also \ninvestigating the influence of different viscosities whilst recording the AE r.m.s levels. Prior to \nperforming the tests, the temperature of the test bearing was raised to approximately 40\u00b0C; this \nwas achieved by running the test-rig in excess of 1000 rpm at 1KN. As soon as the desired \ntemperature was reached, the test sequence began.  \n \nThe tests conditions investigated included five rotational speeds (750rpm, 1500rpm, 2500rpm, \n3500rpm and 4500rpm) three oil types (SP68, SP220 and SP460) and three load conditions, \n(2KN, 6KN, 10KN). Load on the test hydrodynamic bearing was achieved with two hydraulic \nmechanisms either side of the test bearing. Two hydraulic cylinders were connected to two \nloading bearings (ball bearing) which were fixed on the shaft either side of the hydrodynamic \ntest bearing. These were placed either side of the test bearing to ensure uniform loading along the \nlength of the test bearing. Given that such bearings are known to emit significant AE noise a \ncircumferential groove was cut into the shaft and a \u2018\u2019plastic\u2019\u2019 strip was placed between the inner \nrace of the bearing and the shaft, see figure 3. This ensured no AE transmission from the rolling \nelement bearings could influence measured AE\u2019s from the journal bearing. In addition, the drive \nmotor was connected to the drive shaft via a belt drive thus eliminating AE noise generated from \nthe electric motor.   \n \nFigure 3  Nylon 6\/6 applied to attenuate AE from the rolling element bearing \n \nAlso a coupling was employed between the drive shaft and the shaft from the motor within the \ntest bearing, further eliminating reducing any AE\u2019s from outside the test bearing. Attenuation \ntests were undertaken (Hsu, Nelson) on the test rig at various defined locations, see figure 4 and \ntable 1. From the results present it was clear that AE could be transmitted across the plastic strip \nhowever attenuation across the strip to test bearing shaft was in the order of 35dB, this would \nimply a 55-Fold reduction in AE amplitude levels across the strip. This is of particular \nsignificance as all unwanted AE contributors must be eliminated (such as the rolling element \nbearings onto which load are applied to the shaft). Attenuation test were undertaken with the oil \nsupply to the bearing switched on, i.e, oil was flowing into and out of the bearing. \nAcquisition of AE and temperatures values were acquired continuously over a duration of \n10mins for every speed, viscosity and load condition tested. Values presented, hence forth are \naveraged over the 10min duration, in addition, standard deviations are also detailed (see table \nA1, appendix). \n \nFigure 4  Attenuation tests on the test rig \n \n Table 1 Attenuation results in Journal Bearing Test Rig \nAttenuation Nelson Breaks A B C D E F G H I J \nAE Amplitude Ch1(dB) 35 78 - 78 78 40 73 - - - \nAE Amplitude Ch2(dB) 43 75 - - 75 37 71 - - - \nAE Amplitude Ch3(dB) 78 41 - - - - - - - - \n\u2018-\u2018 No detectable emission \n \nExperimental Results \n \nFrom these results and given attenuation rates already ascertained, measurements of AE on the \nhydrodynamic bearing will be void of any contributions from the load carrying rolling element \nbearing. For instance, AE measurements from ch-3 at 4500 rpm were noted at 0.14Vr.m.s, given \nthe attenuation across the plastic strip to the sensors on the test bearing, it would be expected that \nchannel\u2019s 1 or 2 would recorded AE levels in the order of 0.003Vr.m.s on the bearing however AE \nlevels on the test bearing were between 10 to 20 fold higher than 0.003Vr.m.s, authenticating that \nmeasured AE on the test bearing could be attributed to emissions from the test bearing only. \nObservation from a typical test sequence is present in figure 5. \n \nThe results of all tests undertaken are presented in figure 6 which highlights observations of the \ntheoretical minimum film thickness (ho) and AE r.m.s measured on the test bearing for a fixed \nload condition with varying dynamic viscosities. All calculations of minimum film thickness and \npower losses were based on well established procedures [14] with the main influencing factors \nincluding the oil kinematic viscosity, operating temperature, bearing geometry, Sommerfield \nnumber and shaft eccentricity.\t\r \u00a0The Sommerfield number is a non-dimensional number which is \ncharacteristic for a journal bearing in given working conditions.  \n \n Figure 5   Typical test sequence for a load of 6KN (oil SP460) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \t\r \u00a0\nFigure 6 AE r.m.s levels at an applied load 10KN   \n \nIt was evident that an increase in speed resulted in an increase in measured AE even though for \nsame test conditions there was a decrease in theoretical film thickness. For instance at a speed of \n3500rpm and a corresponding bearing temperature of 87\u00b0C the oil film thickness was less than at \nthe lower speed at 2500rpm (75\u00b0C) due to the reduction in viscosity of the oil. Irrespective of the \ndecrease or increase in theoretical film thickness the levels of AE increased with increasing \nrotational speed. Changes in rotational speed resulted in increased AE levels in the order of \n200% on average though the actual predicted change in minimum film thickness with increased \nspeed was of the order of approximately 10% on average for all test, see table A1(appendix). \nStandard deviations (\u03b4) of calculated minimum film thickness values and measured temperature \nvalues are detailed in the appendix and the deviations were deemed low and acceptable. As with \nhydrodynamic bearings, there is no asperity contact and in the author\u2019s view the corresponding \nincrease in AE levels is attributed to the friction associated with the shearing effect of the \nlubricant and associated frictional\/power losses.  The authors thought it prudent to \nestablish\/confirm such a phenomenon. \n \nHydrodynamic Shear Stress \nThe source of AE in a hydrodynamic bearing, given that under normal operating conditions the \nhydrodynamic oil film is sufficiently large to ensure no asperity contact, can only be attributed to \nthe friction within the fluid and the friction reaction of the fluid on the shaft. Such friction in \nfluid is attributed to the shear stress which is defined as the force per unit area exerted by a solid \nboundary on a fluid in motion in a direction on the local tangent plane [15]. The shear stress for a \nNewtonian fluid can be expressed as following equation: \n   (1) \n \n\uf0d8 \u00b5 is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid; \n\uf0d8 u is the velocity of the fluid along the boundary; \n\uf0d8 y is the height of the boundary. \n \nIn calculation of shear stress the inner cylinder (shaft) rotates at constant speed and the inner \ndiameter at the bearing bush is assumed stationary. It is also assumed that the oil flow is laminar. \nTo obtain an expression for velocity profile and shear stress distribution a few assumption have \nbeen made, including: \n1) Steady flow, which eliminates time variations in fluid properties and equations.  \n2) Temperature profile within the oil film is assumed constant. \n3) Incompressible flow,\t\r \u00a0simplifying the governing equations of fluid flow can  \n4) Periphery symmetric flow \n5) No flow or variation of properties in the direction axial \n \nThe relationship between velocity profile, shear stress and film thickness were determined by \nRook [16]: \n\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0 \t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0(2)\t\r \u00a0\n\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0(3)\t\r \u00a0\nWhere: \n-is shear stress distribution in the bearing \n -is dynamic viscosity \n -is rotational speed \n -is shaft radius \n -is bearing radius \n -is film thickness \n \nFrom the equation (3) theoretical estimates of shear stress were determined. Observation of     \nAE r.m.s values for calculated levels of shear stress is shown in figure 7. This shows a steep \nincrease in shear stress levels between 750 to 1500rpm after which levels remained relatively \nsteady(1500 to 2500rpm). From 2500 to 4500 rpm the levels of shear stress steadily decreased \nwith increase speed. \n \nFigure 7  AE r.m.s and shear stresses for varying speed and constant load conditions of \n10KN and different dynamic viscosities \n \nIn an attempt to understand the relationship between AE and shear stress plots showing \ncorrelation between shear stress, film thickness and rotational speed are presented in figure 8. \nFrom this figure three regions are detailed, region \u2019A\u2019,\u2019B\u2019 and \u2018C\u2019. It is evident that in the region \n\u2018A\u2019, an increase in speed resulted in an increase in the theoretical minimum film thicknesses and \na corresponding increase in estimated shear stress values. In region \u2018B\u2019, both parameters of \ndynamic viscosity and rotational speed had a direct influence in reaching shear stress levels and \ntheir calculations to shear stress levels are assumed equal. And finally in region \u2018C\u2019, were \nincreasing the rotational speed caused increasing the oil temperatures and a reduction in the \ndynamic viscosity; the theoretical minimum film thicknesses decreased and a corresponding \ndecrease in the estimated shear stress levels was noted. In this region, the most influencing \nparameter is low viscosity and high rotational speed.  \n These relationships are attributed to the fact that the shear stresses increase when the rotational \nspeed increases but the increase in speed causes an increase in oil temperature thereby decreasing \nthe shear stresses as the oil viscosity decreases. The shaded of area in figure 8 shows the range of \ntheoretically determined shear stress and film thickness values based on experimental \nmeasurements and the sensor accuracies. In addition, the associated friction factor values are \npresented in figure 8; the values of which mirror trends in shear stress and film thickness. The \nfriction factor is dimensionless parameter which is determined from the eccentricity ratio and \nSommerfeld number of the bearing, and, is employed to calculate the power losses of the bearing \n[14]. The result presented in figure 8 was similar for all three different viscosities investigated. \n \n \nFigure 8  Shear stresses, rotational speed, dynamic viscosity (SP220), Power Loss \n(bottom of bearing) and minimum film thickness for load condition 10kN \n \n Of significant note in figure 8 is the relationship between rotational speed and theoretical power \nlosses on the bottom of the journal bearing (in the region of minimum film thickness) where it is \nevident that power losses at the bottom of the bearing do not mirror changes in theoretical film \nthickness, shear stress and friction factor. Even though the friction factor reduces in value with \nincreasing speed, the power losses increase with increasing speed. Thus it because the estimation \nof power losses has a direct relationship with speed and the levels of reduction in friction factor \nis significantly outweighed by increase in speed. This is noted in figure 9 where AE levels are \nseen to increase with total power losses and losses attributed to the bottom of the bearing. This \nwas not surprising as it would be expected that AE will be generated from not only shear stress \nin the region of minimum film thickness but also from splashing of the oil and its motion within \nthe top of the bearing. Therefore it is the total power losses and not the film thickness or shear \nstress or friction factor that is most directly correlated to the measured AE levels; a finding \nwhich hither to has not be reported.  \n \n \nFigure 9  AE r.m.s, rotational speed, dynamic viscosity (SP220), bottom power losses \nand total loss for load condition 10KN \n \nFigure 10 showed that AE levels increased with increasing power losses for all three different \ndynamic viscosities. However at any given speed and dynamic viscosity the variation in load \ncaused an increase in AE levels though the levels were relatively small in relation to the increase \nin AE levels with increasing speed.  \n Figure 10 AE r.m.s and power loss for varying speed and load conditions (2kN, 6kN, \n10kN) at varying dynamic viscosities \n \nConclusion  \nIt is evident that the Acoustic Emission (AE) technology has a great working scope in the \napplication to hydrodynamic bearings. The observations that are presented support the author\u2019s \ntheory that in a properly maintained hydrodynamic lubrication regime the principal source of AE \nis the friction in the shearing of the lubricant in addition to the splashing and motion of the oil \nwithin the bearing. Such a relationship will go some way in further developing the applicability \nof AE technology to monitoring rotating machinery. To date this is the first attempt at correlating \nAE with fluid friction and power losses in a hydrodynamic bearing. \n \n References \n1) Vaneshette T.
