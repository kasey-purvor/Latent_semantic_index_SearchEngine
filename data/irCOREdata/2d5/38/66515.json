Using Chandra, we find\na position for the X-ray source of \u03b1 = 08h 19m 28.98s, \u03b4 = +70\u25e642\u203219.\u2032\u20323 (J2000) with\nan uncertainty of 0.6\u2032\u2032. We identify a bright, point-like optical counterpart centered in\nthe nebula with the X-ray source. The optical magnitude and color of the counterpart\nare consistent with a star with spectral type between O4V and B3 Ib at a distance\nof 3.05 Mpc or reprocessed emission from an X-ray illuminated accretion disk. The\nnebular Heii luminosity is 2.7\u00d71036 erg s\u22121. The morphology of the Heii, H\u03b2, and [Oi]\nemission are consistent with being due to X-ray photoionization and are inconsistent\nwith narrow beaming of the X-ray emission. A spectral model consisting of a multicolor\ndisk blackbody with inverse-Compton emission from a hot corona gives a good fit\nto X-ray spectra obtained with XMM-Newton. Using the fitted X-ray spectrum, we\ncalculate the relation between the Heii and X-ray luminosity and find that the Heii\nflux implies a lower bound on the X-ray luminosity in the range 4 to 6\u00d7 1039 erg s\u22121\nif the extrapolation of the X-ray spectrum between 54 eV and 300 eV is accurate.

If the X-rays are beamed, then the ULXs may be\naccreting \u201cnormal\u201d mass (< 20M\u2299) black holes or even neu-\ntron stars. King et al. (2001) have suggested that ULXs are\nhigh-mass X-ray binaries with super-Eddington mass trans-\nfer rates in which the X-ray emission is funnelled, producing\nhigh observed X-ray fluxes for observers near the beaming\naxis. Motivated by the recent suggestion that jets may con-\ntribute a significant fraction of the observed X-ray flux in\nGalactic binaries previously thought to be dominated by\ndisk and coronal emission (Markoff, Falcke, & Fender 2001),\nKo\u00a8rding et al. (2002) have suggested that the ULXs may be\nstellar-mass black holes in which relativistic beaming in jets\naligned nearly along our line of sight produce the high ap-\nparent X-ray fluxes.\nIf the ULXs are not strongly beamed, then the\nmasses required for the sources to be emitting below their\nEddington luminosities are large, well above the maxi-\nmum possible mass (\u223c 20M\u2299) for a black hole pro-\nduced at the endpoint of the evolution of a normal star.\nHence, the compact objects would be \u201cintermediate-mass\u201d\nblack holes (Colbert & Mushotzky 1999). This has poten-\ntially interesting consequences. Intermediate-mass black\nholes may be excellent sources of gravitational radia-\ntion (Ebisuzaki et al. 2001; Miller & Hamilton 2002). They\nmay be relics of the first generation of star formation\n(Madau & Rees 2001), where, due to the absence of met-\nals, extremely massive stars were likely to have formed\n(Larson 1998). Or, they may be important in the formation\nof supermassive black holes (Ptak & Griffiths 1999).\nPakull & Mironi (2002) discovered an Heii \u03bb4686\nemission line nebula in the ROSAT error box for the\nULX in the dwarf irregular galaxy Holmberg II at a\ndistance of 3.05 Mpc (Hoessel, Saha, & Danielson 1998).\nX-ray emission was first detected from Holmberg II in\nthe ROSAT all-sky survey and then localized in ROSAT\nc\u00a9 2004 RAS\n2 P. Kaaret et al.\nHRI observations to a single, highly variable source with\na maximum luminosity (if isotropic) of \u223c 1040 erg s\u22121\n(Zezas, Georgantopoulos, & Ward 1999). If a ULX is em-\nbedded in a diffuse nebula, then the X-radiation of the ULX\nshould photoionize the nebula, as seen for the nebula sur-\nrounding LMC X-1 (Pakull & Angebault 1986). Photoion-\nization produces (at most) one optical\/UV photon for each\nX-ray photon doing the excitation, so the line flux from the\nnebula is a direct measure of the total number of ionizing\nphotons emitted in all directions. For example, measurement\nof the Heii \u03bb4686 flux gives a direct count of all source pho-\ntons with energies above 54 eV which ionize the nebula.\nThe discovery of an Heiii region near a ULX offers the ex-\nciting prospect of determining observationally whether or\nnot the X-ray emission from the ULX is beamed. If the\nULX is truly ultraluminous, then the X-ray photoioniza-\ntion should produce observable UV and optical line emission\nfrom high excitation levels. Pakull & Mironi (2002) report an\ninferred photoionization luminosity of (3\u221213)\u00d71039 erg s\u22121\nfor a distance of 3.2 Mpc based on an assumed thermal\nbremsstrahlung X-ray spectrum, X-ray spectral measure-\nments from the ROSAT PSPC (Fourniol 1998) and ASCA\n(Miyaji, Lehman, and Hasinger 2001), and modelling of the\nphotoionization nebula. The lower end of their allowed lu-\nminosity range is consistent with the highest luminosities\nobserved from stellar-mass black hole candidate X-ray bina-\nries within the Milky Way.\nHere, we report on Hubble Space Telescope observations\nof the vicinity of the ULX in Holmberg II taken in the optical\nemission lines Heii \u03bb4686, H\u03b2, and [Oi] \u03bb6300, new Chandra\nHigh-Resolution Camera observations, and archival XMM-\nNewton data. The improved X-ray position from Chandra\nstrengthens the association of the nebula with the X-ray\nsource. The HST images enable detailed inspection of the\nmorphology of the nebula and allow us to isolate it from\nother nearby nebulosities. The XMM-Newton data provide\nhigh quality information on the X-ray spectrum which are\nessential to constraining the true luminosity of the system.\nWe describe the observations and analysis in \u00a7 2, and discuss\nthe implications in \u00a7 3.\n2 OBSERVATIONS AND ANALYSIS\n2.1 Chandra Observations\nObservations of Holmberg II were made using the High-\nResolution Camera (HRC) onboard the Chandra X-Ray Ob-\nservatory (ObsID 3816; PI Kaaret). The HRC was used and\nthe source was placed off-axis to prevent pile-up from affect-\ning the position determination. The Chandra observation\nbegan on 3 July 2003 05:56:20 UT and had a useful exposure\nof 4.9 ks. Chandra data were subjected to standard process-\ning and event screening. No strong background flares were\nfound, so the entire observation was used. A bright source is\ndetected at high significance which we identify with the ULX\nin Holmberg II (Zezas, Georgantopoulos, & Ward 1999;\nKerp, Walter, and Brinks 2002). The Chandra position is:\n\u03b1 = 08h 19m 28.98s, \u03b4 = +70\u25e642\u203219.\u2032\u20323 (J2000).\nThis position is determined using the Chandra aspect\nsolution, which has an estimated uncertainty of 0.6\u2032\u2032\nat 90% confidence (see the Chandra aspect pages at\nhttp:\/\/cxc.harvard.edu\/cal\/ASPECT\/celmon). The X-ray\nimage is consistent with that expected for a point source\nat the given position off-axis. We find no evidence for a sig-\nnificant extended component as reported by Miyaji et al.\n(2001).\n2.2 XMM-Newton data\nWe extracted observations of Holmberg II from the XMM-\nNewton archive. Analysis of these data have been previously\nreported by Dewangan et al. (2004). We reduced the data\nand generated response matrices using the SAS software ver-\nsion 5.4.1. We use only data from the EPIC-PN. We exam-\nined the three useful available observations. The first obser-\nvation occurred on 10 April 2002 (ID 0112520601; PI Wat-\nson). The time on-target was 5.1 ks, during which the total\nPN rate was always below 20 c\/s indicating there were no\nbackground flares. The total exposure after live time cor-\nrection was 4.7 ks. The second observation occurred on 16\nApril 2002 (ID 0112520701; PI Watson). There were several\nbackground flares, so we filtered the data to remove times\nwith PN count rates above 35 c\/s. The third observation oc-\ncurred on 19 Sept 2002 (ID 0112520901; PI Watson). There\nwere, again, background flares and we filtered the data to re-\nmoved times with PN count rates above 20 c\/s. Spectra were\nextracted from circular regions with a radius of 24\u2032\u2032. For all\nobservations, the source was located near a chip edge, and\nwe used circular background regions on the same chip. The\nspectra were regrouped to have at least 100 counts per bin\nfor the first two observations and 25 counts per bin for the\nlast. Models were fitted to the spectra using XSPEC version\n11.2 over an energy band from 0.3 to 8 keV.\nAs found by Dewangan et al. (2004), complex or mul-\nticomponent models are required to obtain adequate fits. A\nmodel consisting of the sum of powerlaw plus disk blackbody\nemission each modified by interstellar absorption has often\nbeen used to model the spectra of black hole X-ray bina-\nries and ultraluminous X-ray sources. Using such a model,\nwe find best-fitting parameters similar to those reported by\nDewangan et al. (2004).\nA key input to the photoionization modelling is the\nX-ray spectrum. To input to the photoionization code, we\nmust extrapolate the fitted X-ray spectrum to energies be-\nlow the minimum observed X-ray energy; the shape of the\nspectrum between 54 eV and 300 eV is important in deter-\nmining the relation between the Heii luminosity and the X-\nray luminosity. In the powerlaw plus disk blackbody model,\nthe powerlaw component is an adhoc model for a Comp-\nton emission component arising from disk photons inverse-\nCompton scattered by energetic electrons in a corona. This\nsuggests that the powerlaw component should be cut off at\nenergies below the disk temperature. However, the model\ncontains no prescription for the form of such a cutoff. We\nrequire a model in which the low energy extension of the\nspectrum is well defined and physically motivated. Based on\nthe application of Comptonization models for detailed phys-\nical modelling of the multiwavelength spectral of black hole\nX-ray binaries, we choose to use a Comptonization model\n(Poutanen & Svensson 1996). Specifically, we use the model\nof Poutanen & Svensson (1996), compps in XSPEC, to calcu-\nlate the spectrum produced by thermal Comptonization of\nphotons emitted with a disk blackbody spectrum and scat-\nc\u00a9 2004 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20137\nHeii Nebula in Holmberg II 3\nObservation kTin kTe \u03c4 LX LPI\n[keV] [keV] [erg cm\u22122 s\u22121] [erg s\u22121]\n10 April 0.22+0.02\n\u22120.08\n49\u00b1 14 1.1+0.3\n\u22120.4\n16 \u00d7 1039 5.9\u00d7 1039\n16 April 0.20\u00b1 0.02 76\u00b1 23 0.8\u00b1 0.3 17 \u00d7 1039 6.1\u00d7 1039\n19 Sept 0.17\u00b1 0.02 71\u00b1 30 0.4+0.4\n\u22120.2\n5\u00d7 1039 3.7\u00d7 1039\nTable 1.

The model parameters allowed to vary\nin the fits are the disk temperature kTin, the corona electron\ntemperature kTe, and the corona optical depth \u03c4 .\nBecause the metallicity of Holmberg II is significantly\nlower than solar, we use two absorption components: one\nto model absorption within the Milky Way for which we\nfix the metallicity at solar and fix the absorption column\ndensity NH = (3.42 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7 10\n20 cm\u22122, and a second to\nmodel absorption within Holmberg II for which we fix the\nmetallicity at Z = 0.07Z\u2299 (Mirioni 2002). We performed\na simultaneous fit to the data for all three observations in\nwhich the absorption within Holmberg II was the same for\nall observations and the Comptonization model parameters\nwere allowed to vary individually for each observation. We\nfound an adequate fit with \u03c72\/DoF = 273.5\/285. The best\nfit parameters are reported in Table 1. The best fit column\ndensity is (3.7 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122. We note that this col-\numn density is significantly above that found by Dewangan\net al. (2004) because the absorption, beyond the Galactic\ncomponent, is calculated for the low metallicity appropriate\nto Holmberg II.\nThe three XMM-Newton observations cover the ex-\ntremes of X-ray flux detected from Holmberg II X-1\n(Dewangan et al. 2004). Therefore, these observations also\nlikely cover the range of X-ray spectral variations in the\nsource.\nWe note a thermal bremsstrahlung model as used by\nPakull & Mirioni (2002) for input to their photoionization\nmodelling does not provide an adequate fit to any of the\nobservations, even with use of two distinct absorption com-\nponents.\n2.3 HST observations\nObservations were made of Holmberg II centered on the po-\nsition of the ULX using the Advanced Camera for Surveys\n(ACS) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) under GO pro-\ngram 9684 (PI Kaaret). Observations were made in the nar-\nrow band filters FR462N centered on Heii \u03bb4686, FR505N\ncentered on H\u03b2 \u03bb4861, and FR656N centered on [Oi] \u03bb6300.\nImages in the FR462N filter were obtained on 21 January\n2003 and 25 June 2003. For the January observation, the\naimpoint was placed closed to the ramp filter edge and there\nare non-uniformities in transmission across the image. For\nthis reason, we quote fluxes for the Heii emission based only\non the June observation. The images in all of the other filters\nwere obtained on 24 November 2002. All of the narrow band\nfilters have a 2% bandwidth. The recession velocity of Holm-\nberg II is 157 km\/s (Strauss et al. 1992), so the redshifted\nemission lines lie within the filter bandpasses. In addition,\nobservations were made in the medium filters FR459M and\nF550M for continuum imaging and continuum subtraction.\nThe standard processing for ACS data does not perform\ncosmic-ray removal for images without cosmic-ray splits. Be-\ncause all of our observations except those in the FR462N fil-\nter were performed in dither patterns without cosmic-ray\nsplits, we re-processed all observations using the PyRAF\ntask multidrizzle in STSDAS 3.1 to remove the cosmic ray\nhits. We found residual sky level offsets in the images and\nremoved these by fitting a gaussian to those pixels not con-\ntaining astronomical objects in a 30\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 30\u2032\u2032 field centered\nnear the ULX and subtracting off the gaussian centroid.\nWe aligned the F550M (narrow V band) image to 10 stars\nselected from the USNO A2.0 catalog (Monet et al. 1996)\nusing the imwcs tool from the Smithsonian Astrophysical\nObservatory Telescope Data Center. Based on the residual\noffsets for the 10 stars, we estimate that the astrometric\nuncertainty is 0.3\u2032\u2032. We then aligned each other image to\nthe aspect corrected F550M image using the IRAF tools ge-\nomap and geotran (Tody et al. 1993). We checked the align-\nment using the tool xregister and found that the residual\nmisalignments were less than 0.1 pixel.\nWe produced continuum subtracted images using the\nFR459M image to estimate the continuum for the FR462N\nHeii \u03bb4686 and FR505N H\u03b2 \u03bb4861 images, and the F550M\nimage to estimate the continuum for the FR656N [Oi] \u03bb6300\nimage. Since we are interested primarily in the diffuse, neb-\nular emission, we located the stars in each frame and sub-\ntracted off the stellar emission before performing the con-\ntinuum subtraction. We fit a Moffat profile to several bright\nstars to determine the point spread function shape, and then\nused that fixed shape in fitting and subtracting the stars. We\nnote that the FR459M image used for continuum subtrac-\ntion of the FR462N image contains the Heii line. We correct\nfor the apparent reduction in the Heii line flux caused by\npartial subtraction of the line as described below.\nFor the continuum subtraction of the nebula, we as-\nsumed that the intrinsic continuum spectrum is flat, F (\u03bb) \u221d\n\u03bbn with n = 0 and reddened with an extinction of E(B-V)\n= 0.024 (Stewart et al. 2000). For the Heii and H\u03b2 images,\nthe continuum band lies close to the line wavelength, and\nchanging the continuum slope does not significantly affect\nthe estimated line flux (we discuss this further below in the\nestimation of the total Heii line flux). For [Oi], the line wave-\nlength lies further from the best continuum band available.\nFor [Oi], we repeated this procedure using continuum slopes\nc\u00a9 2004 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20137\n4 P.

Each line image was smoothed with a gaussian filter with a\nFWHM of 0.24\u2032\u2032.\nn = +2 and n = \u22122. We found that the morphology of\nthe [Oi] emission varied little. Fig. 1 shows the continuum\nsubtracted images in the three lines and the F550M (nar-\nrow V band) continuum image. The Heiii nebula reported\nby Pakull and Mironi (2002) is clearly detected and is at a\nposition consistent with that of the X-ray source.\nThere is one bright point source within the nebula vis-\nible in the narrow V-band image. The source profile ap-\npears similar to those of other stars in each image and there\nis no evidence for spatial extent. The source appears to\nbe a star, but a compact core of the nebula, unresolved\nat the resolution of the ACS\/WFC, could also contribute\nto the emission. The position of the star is \u03b1 = 08h 19m\n28s.99 and \u03b4 = +70\u25e6 42\u2032 19\u2032\u2032.0 (J2000). This is 0.3\u2032\u2032 from\nthe Chandra position for the X-ray source. This offset is\nless than the relative astrometric uncertainty between the\nChandra and HST images. Therefore, we consider the op-\ntical star to be the counterpart of the X-ray source. We\nfind the ST magnitudes of the star to be 22.04 \u00b1 0.08 in\nthe F550M filter and 21.35 \u00b1 0.10 in the FR459M filter.\nThe dominant uncertainty is in the removal of the underly-\ning nebular component. If we consider only the extinction\nc\u00a9 2004 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20137\nHeii Nebula in Holmberg II 5\nwithin the Milky Way, then the reddening-corrected equiv-\nalent Johnson V magnitude is 21.86 \u00b1 0.09 and the color\n(B \u2212 V)0 = \u22120.20 \u00b1 0.15. Conversion to standard Johnson\nmagnitudes increases the quoted uncertainty because the\nfilters used only approximately match the Johnson bands.\nThere may also be extinction within Holmberg II. Using the\nrelation between NH and E(B\u2212V ) determined for the SMC\n(Bouchet et al. 1985), we find E(B\u2212V ) = 0.07\u00b10.01 based\non our spectral fit to XMM-Newton data. This is an upper\nbound on the reddening since it is not clear whether the\ncolumn density observed towards the X-ray source neces-\nsarily obscures the companion star. In some Galactic black\nholes, the X-ray absorption is seen to vary on a time scale of\nminutes, indicating that the absorption occurs close to the\ncompact object (Tomsick, Lapshov, Kaaret 1998). Applying\nthis additional reddening with an SMC extinction law, we\nfind a Johnson V magnitude of 21.64 \u00b1 0.11 and a color\n(B\u2212 V)0 = \u22120.25 \u00b1 0.16.\nTo estimate the Heii \u03bb4686 line flux from the nebula, we\nfound the total count rates for the nebula in the FR462N and\nFR459M images from which the stellar emission had been\nsubtracted. We defined the nebula using a contour drawn\nto enclose the Heii and H\u03b2 emission which is shown as a\ncyan curve in the H\u03b2 image in Fig. 1. The FR459M filter\nbandpass included the Heii \u03bb4686 emission line (unfortu-\nnately, the FR459M bandpass is too wide to exclude both\nHeii and the stronger H\u03b2 and H\u03b3 emission from the nebula).\nHence, we must solve for the Heii line flux and the contin-\nuum flux given the nebular count rates in the two filters. We\nassumed that the nebular continuum emission has a power-\nlaw spectrum F (\u03bb) \u221d \u03bbn. We used the IRAF tool calcphot\nin the synphot package with HST\/ACS calibration files re-\nleased on 10 Dec 2003 to find count rates in each filter for\ngiven continuum flux and Heii line flux. We then inverted\nthe matrix relating the fluxes to count rates and calculated\nthe fluxes from the measured count rates. For a flat contin-\nuum with n = 0, we find that the flux in the Heii line is\n2.4\u00d710\u221215 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121. Our continuum subtraction proce-\ndure depends on the assumed continuum shape. Repeating\nthe procedure for n = +2 and n = \u22122, we find that the\nuncertainty in the Heii line flux induced by the uncertainty\nin the continuum slope is of order 3%. Including additional\nfactors such as the uncertainties in the subtraction of the\nstars, the calibrations of the filters, and the subtraction of\nthe sky background, we estimate an overall uncertainty in\nour Heii flux measurement of 9%.\nUsing the same contour defined for the Heii, which was\ndrawn to enclose both the Heii and H\u03b2 emission, we found\nthe flux in H\u03b2 of 1.1 \u00d7 10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 and in [Oi] of\n1.3 \u00d7 10\u221215 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121. The uncertainty on the H\u03b2 flux\nis 5% and on the [Oi] is 20%. We find a ratio Heii\/H\u03b2 =\n0.22 \u00b1 0.02. This is larger than the value of 0.16 found by\nPakull and Mironi (2002), but the difference may be due to\nsampling of a larger spatial region due to the effect of seeing\nin their ground-based spectrum. To test this, we convolved\nour image with a gaussian with 2.0\u2032\u2032 FWHM and then ex-\ntracted fluxes from a circular region with the same area as\nthe contour defined in Fig. 1. We find Heii\/H\u03b2 = 0.18\u00b10.02,\nconsistent with Pakull and Mironi (2002). The ratio is at the\nextreme end of the range found in photoionized nebulae in\nnearby galaxies (Garnett et al. 1991).\n0 10 20 30 40\nRadius [pc]\n1032\n1033\n1034\nSu\nrfa\nce\n b\nrig\nht\nne\nss\n [e\nrg\n s-\n1  \npc\n-\n2 ]\nFigure 2.

Our improved X-ray astrometry de-\nrived from Chandra strengthens the association of the nebula\nwith the X-ray source.\nWe detect one point-like source within the body of the\nnebula. This source is likely the optical counterpart to the\nULX. For a distance to Holmberg II of 3.05 Mpc, the abso-\nlute magnitude MV of this source is between \u22125.5 and \u22125.9\ndepending on whether there is reddening within Holmberg\nII as discussed in section 2.3. The absolute magnitude and\nB-V color are consistent a range of spectral types from O4V\nto B3 Ib. We note that this spectral classification is valid\nonly if there is no significant contribution of optical light\nfrom the accretion disk and if the star is not significantly af-\nfected by the gravitational pull or X-ray emission from the\ncompact object. Alternatively, the optical emission may be\nreprocessed emission from an X-ray illuminated accretion\ndisk. The ratio of observed X-ray to optical flux and the B-\nV color are consistent with those found for low-mass X-ray\nbinaries in which the optical emission is dominated by an\nX-ray illuminated disk (van Paradijs & McClintock 1995).\nOther optical counterpart searches have found early-\ntype stellar counterparts to ultraluminous X-ray sources.\nThe optical counterpart to M81 X-6 (Fabbiano 1988) has\ncolors consistent with an O8V star, although there is some\nuncertainty in the spectral type due to significant reddening\n(Liu, Bregman, & Seitzer 2002). For NGC 1313 X-2, only\nthe R magnitude of the counterpart has been measured; the\nabsolute magnitude is consistent with an early O main se-\nquence star or an OB supergiant (Zampieri et al. 2004). In\nNGC 5204, the optical counterpart found on ground-based\nimages (Roberts et al. 2001) was resolved into two sources\nwith HST images (Goad et al. 2002).\nc\u00a9 2004 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20137\n6 P. Kaaret et al.\nFor Holmberg II, Pakull and Mironi (2002) report that\nthe Heii \u03bb4686 emission has a FWHM of 2.2\u2032\u2032 and that the\n[Oi] is offset to the West of the Heii emission. Our HST\nimages confirm these basic results and provide much more\ndetailed information on the morphology of the nebula.\nThe maximum extent of the Heii emission is to the West\nof the central star and is about 1.7\u2032\u2032 or 26 pc for a distance\nto Holmberg II of 3.05 Mpc. The extent of the nebula to-\nwards the East is shorter, about 1.0\u2032\u2032 or 15 pc. To the West\nof the central star (from NW to SW), the morphology of\nthe H\u03b2 emission is similar to, but more extended than, that\nof the Heii emission and [Oi] emission is low close to the\nstar and stronger farther out, particularly past the point\nwhere the Heii emission peaks. This is consistent with the\nbehaviour expected for a photo-ionized nebula. Heii emis-\nsion is produced in regions of high excitation and should be\nconcentrated near the central source. H\u03b2 is produced over\na broad range of excitation and should cover a larger spa-\ntial range than Heii. [Oi] is preferentially produced at lower\nexcitation than Heii and should be produced in the outer\nregions of the nebula. Hence, the relative morphologies of\nthe Heii, H\u03b2, and [Oi] emission support the hypothesis that\nthe nebula is photoionized (Pakull & Mirioni 2002). Fig. 2\nshows the surface brightness versus radius calculated for a\nphotoionized nebula (discussed further below) for compari-\nson.\nTo the East and South of the central star, the morphol-\nogy of the H\u03b2 emission is very similar to that of the Heii\nemission and [Oi] emission is absent. This is also consis-\ntent with a X-ray photoionized nebula if the column density\nof the nebula integrated along line of sight outward from\nthe central star, is sufficiently small that the entire nebula\nto the East and South is excited to produce Heii emission\n(Pakull & Mirioni 2002).\nWe note that there is additional H\u03b2 emission to the NW\nof the central star and beyond the extent of the Heii emission\nwhich appears to be part of a ring nebula surrounding a\nbright star visible in the narrow V band image and unrelated\nto the Heii nebula. Also, the isolated Heii bright spot to\nthe SE of the central star appears to be due to incomplete\nsubtraction of a star visible in the narrow V band image.\nIf the nebula is powered by X-ray photoionization from\nthe central source, then the morphology of the nebula ap-\npears inconsistent with narrow beaming of the X-ray emis-\nsion.\nThe Heii nebular emission is likely isotropic. Therefore,\nthe measured flux should provide a good estimate of the true\nluminosity. For a distance to Holmberg II of 3.05 Mpc, the\nHeii \u03bb4686 line flux found here for the nebula implies a line\nluminosity of 2.7 \u00d7 1036 erg s\u22121. This is consistent with the\nvalue reported by Pakull & Mironi (2002).\nHeii \u03bb4686 emission is produced via the recombination\nof doubly ionized He++ and acts as a photon counter of ra-\ndiation ionizing the nebula in the He+ Lyman continuum\nabove 54 eV. Following Pakull & Mironi (2002), we use\nthis property to estimate the true luminosity of the X-ray\nsource. The major uncertainty in their estimate was impre-\ncise knowledge of the shape of the photon spectrum illumi-\nnating the nebula. Using the XMM-Newton spectra, we are\nable to reduce this uncertainty.\nWe used the photoionization code Cloudy version 94.00\n(Ferland 2001) to estimate the true X-ray luminosity based\non the measured Heii luminosity. We used a metallicity of\nZ = 0.07Z\u2299 (Mirioni 2002). The relation between the total\nHeii flux and the total ionizing X-ray flux is not sensitive to\nthe metallicity. We ran simulations over a range of hydrogen\ndensity within the nebula from 1 to 100 cm\u22123. The relation\nbetween the total Heii flux and the total ionizing X-ray flux\nis not sensitive to the density as long as the region of fully\nionized He is contained within the simulated nebula. The\nspatial extent of the Heii emitting region is sensitive to the\ndensity. A constant density of 10 cm\u22123 gave a reasonable\nmatch to the observed spatial extent of the Heii emission,\nand we use this value in the simulations presented here. In\nthe modeling, we assumed a spherical geometry with a filling\nfactor of unity. We assumed that there is no absorption be-\ntween the X-ray source and the nebula. We also include the\nphoton flux of an O5V star modelled as a blackbody with a\ntemperature 42000 K and a luminosity of 3.2\u00d7 1039 erg s\u22121.\nFig. 2 shows the calculated surface brightness versus appar-\nent offset from the X-ray source. The surface brightness was\ncalculated by integrating the emissivity along lines of sight\nthrough a spherically symmetric nebula.\nTable 1 shows the photoionization luminosities required\nto produce the measured Heii luminosity for the various\nbest fit Comptonization spectra. The inferred photoioniza-\ntion luminosities range from 3.7 to 6.1 \u00d7 1039 erg s\u22121. The\nlow luminosity value comes from the September 2002 obser-\nvation during which the source was in an unusual low\/soft\nstate (Dewangan et al. 2004). The correct X-ray spectrum\nto use in the photoionization modelling would be a luminos-\nity weighted average of observed spectra sampling a duration\ncomparable to the recombination time of He++ in the neb-\nula, roughly 3000 years for an electron density of 10 cm\u22123\nand temperature of 20,000 K. The luminosity weighting\nwould suggest a photoionization luminosity near the high\nend of the range.\nTo test the sensitivity of these results to the flux from\nthe companion star, we also made runs with the O5V star\nreplaced by a B2 Ib star modelled as a blackbody with a\ntemperature 18,500 K and a luminosity of 2 \u00d7 1038 erg s\u22121.\nThe inferred photoionization luminosities increase by 12 to\n16% if a B2 Ib star is used in place of the O5V star.\nAs noted above, our photoionization model assumes a\ncovering factor of unity and sufficient depth radially so that\nthe entire X-ray flux of the central source is absorbed. In-\nspection of the Heii line emission image shows that the cov-\nering factor is below unity. Also, as described above, [Oi]\nemission should be present at larger radii than the Heii emis-\nsion if the nebula is not density bounded. Comparison of the\n[Oi] and Heii images shows the nebula is density bounded to\nthe East and South of the central star. Therefore, the pho-\ntoionization luminosity quoted here should be considered a\nlower bound to the total luminosity of the ionizing radia-\ntion. Partial absorption intrinsic to the X-ray source would\nharden the soft X-ray flux illuminating the nebula and would\nincrease the required luminosity. The unabsorbed X-ray lu-\nminosity in the Comptonization models, assuming isotropic\nemission, ranges from 5 to 17 \u00d7 1039 erg s\u22121 for the three\nobservations. This is consistent with the luminosity inferred\nfrom the Heii emission, given that the Heii emission likely\nunderestimates the true luminosity due to the covering fac-\ntor of the nebula being less than one and the nebula being\ndensity bounded along several lines of sight.\nc\u00a9 2004 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20137\nHeii Nebula in Holmberg II 7\nWe conclude that the X-ray and Heii data are consis-\ntent with the X-ray source being the ionization source pow-\nering the line emission from the nebula. The luminosity in\nHeii emission is more than an order of magnitude greater\nthan that observed from a similar nebula around the black\nhole candidate LMC X-1 (Pakull & Angebault 1986), sug-\ngesting that Holmberg II contains a much more powerful\nX-ray source. We estimate that the total luminosity of the\nX-ray source is at least 3.3 \u00d7 1039 erg s\u22121 and likely above\n6 \u00d7 1039 erg s\u22121 if the extrapolation of the X-ray spectrum\nbetween 54 eV and 300 eV is accurate. This suggests that\nthe compact object is truly ultraluminous. Assuming an Ed-\ndington luminosity of 1.3\u00d71038 erg s\u22121M\u22121\n\u2299\n, the compact ob-\nject mass would be at least 25M\u2299 and likely above 40M\u2299.\nThis may suggest a compact object which is more massive\nthan the stellar-mass black holes candidates in our Galaxy,\nfor which all of the dynamically measured masses lie below\n20M\u2299 (McClintock & Remillard(2003)).\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank the Aspen Center for Physics for its hospitality\nduring the workshop \u201cCompact Objects in External Galax-\nies\u201d and an anonymous referee for comments which improved\nthis manuscript.
