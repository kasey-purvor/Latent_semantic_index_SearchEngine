In a dry\nyear, about 150,000 ha are irrigated, supplying the UK\nfood market with substantial quantities of high-quality\nvegetables (notably potatoes) and horticultural produce.\nOver half (60%) of the total irrigated area and 57% of the\ntotal volume of water applied is in eastern England (Knox\net al, 2000), one of the driest and most water-stressed\nregions of the UK. Irrigation is concentrated on high-\nvalue crops, which do not receive European subsidy\nsupport, yet deliver substantial economic benefits. In East\nAnglia alone, irrigation supports 50,000 livelihoods, hence\ncontributing over \u00a33 billion annually to the region\u2019s\neconomy. This excludes the additional benefits beyond the\nfarm gate, where many businesses provide equipment and\nfarm supplies, post-harvest processing and packaging,\nmarketing, transport and distribution services related to\nirrigated production.\nDespite its importance to the rural economy, the\nsustainability of irrigated production is under threat due\nto competition from other sectors (notably public supply),\ncombined with new legislation to achieve greater\nenvironmental protection. There are also concerns\nregarding water reliability, as the majority of catchments\nin which irrigated production is concentrated are defined\nby the regulatory authority, the Environment Agency\n(EA), as being either over-abstracted or over-licensed\nduring low-flow periods. These are effectively the\nsummer months when irrigation need is at its peak. In\n2006, nearly a quarter (23%) of the total volume licensed\nfor irrigation abstraction in the Anglian region was from\n304 Outlook on AGRICULTURE Vol 38, No 4\nImproving irrigation efficiency in a temperate climate\nFigure 1. Environment Agency (EA) defined water resource availability in the Anglian region in 2008.\nNorth East\nSouthern\nMidlands\nAnglian\nSouth West\nEA Wales\nNorth\nWest\nThames\nWater available\nNo water available\nOver-licensed\nOver-abstracted\nResource availability status\ncatchments defined as being \u2018over-abstracted\u2019, where\nexisting abstractions were causing unacceptable damage\nto the environment at low flows. A further half (47%) was\nfrom catchments defined as \u2018over-licensed\u2019, where\nunacceptable environmental damage would result if all\nexisting licences were fully used. Only 9% was from\n\u2018water available\u2019 catchments, where additional summer\nlow-flow water could be made available (Figure 1).\nWhilst agriculture faces increasing uncertainty\nregarding water availability, the underlying demand for\nirrigation continues to grow, driven by supermarket\ndemands for continuous supplies of premium-quality\nproduce. Taking into account the annual variation in\nsummer weather, which influences the agronomic need\nfor irrigation, the total volume of water applied each year\nin England is growing at an underlying rate of 2.1% per\n305Outlook on AGRICULTURE Vol 38, No 4\nImproving irrigation efficiency in a temperate climate\nannum; similarly, the total area irrigated is growing at a\nrate of 0.9% per annum (Weatherhead, 2006). These\nfigures confirm that water is increasingly concentrated on\nhigh-value crops such as potatoes, horticulture (notably\nsalads) and soft fruit (strawberries), and that these crops\nare receiving greater application depths. An additional\nconcern is climate change, as irrigation internationally is\nconsidered by many to be the most sensitive of water uses\nand the sector that will be most impacted (D\u00f6ll, 2002). In\nEngland, the impact of a changing climate, with hotter,\ndrier summers and more frequent droughts, is likely to\nreduce water availability further (Henriques et al, 2008)\nand increase irrigation demand (Weatherhead and Knox,\n1999). Indeed, recent forecasts by the Environment\nAgency predict increases in agricultural water demand in\nEngland and Wales for the 2050s of between 25% and\n180%. The range reflects the high sensitivity of the socio-\neconomic scenarios used, depending on whether policies\nto promote sustainability or growth, a dematerialized\nsociety or material consumption, are adopted. These so-\ncalled \u2018axes of uncertainty\u2019 have been shown to impose a\nmuch greater degree of variability on future agricultural\nwater demand than just climate change (EA, 2008).\nIrrigation abstractors are also under public and\nregulatory pressure to demonstrate more efficient use of\nwater. Supermarkets are exerting pressure through their\ngrower protocols (for example, Tesco\u2019s Natures Choice)\nand water regulations require farmers to demonstrate\nefficiency as a condition of licence renewal. Clearly,\nwithout secure water supplies, many farms and\nagribusinesses would simply not survive; water scarcity\nwould force a shift in land use away from intensive\nirrigated cropping to low-input cereal production, with\nsignificant adverse impacts for rural employment and\neconomic productivity.\nIn 2007, following two dry years (2003 and 2006), the\nEA and East of England Development Agency (EEDA)\ncommissioned the development of a water strategy for the\nagri-food sector. This was in response to the need for an\nevidence base on the environmental impacts of\nagricultural abstraction, coupled with concerns regarding\nrural employment. The objective was to build capacity\nwithin the agricultural sector to ensure it received a fair\nshare of the available water resource and used it in a more\nsustainable and efficient way. Although the strategy was\ndeveloped for eastern England, due to its high\ndependence on water for production, the strategy and its\nunderlying principles are equally applicable to England as\na whole, and indeed other countries where irrigation is an\nimportant component of the rural economy.\nDefining a strategic framework\nAlthough some farmers were starting to manage their\nwater supplies better, initiatives to improve water\nefficiency and conservation across the industry were\nurgently needed. Some measures, such as adopting more\nscientific approaches to irrigation scheduling, could be\nundertaken by individuals, but others would need\ncollective action due to the complex nature of water\nresources management. Following extensive consultation\nwith key informants in the agri-food sector and with\nstakeholders in water and environmental management,\nTable 1. Water strategy themes.\nTheme Description\nWorking together to protect Improving dialogue between\nwater rights individual abstractors, the agri-\nfood industry and the regulator\nMaking best use of available Improving the security of on-farm\nwater water supplies and ensuring its\nwise use\nDeveloping a knowledge Improving water management\nbase knowledge and skills training\nwithin the agri-food industry\nthree themes were identified (Table 1). Development of\nthe strategy involved combining data derived from desk-\nbased research, collating farmer sentiment and opinion\nvia stakeholder workshops, and using computer\nmodelling and geographic information system (GIS)\nmapping. This paper describes the strategy, the rationale\nfor each theme, the key actions required and plans for\nimplementation.\nWorking together to protect water rights\n(Theme 1)\nAs in many countries, the \u2018voice\u2019 of water for agriculture\nin the UK is weak and fragmented and many farmers are\ndisadvantaged when negotiating water rights with the\nregulator and influencing future water policy towards\nagricultural use. So developing farmers\u2019 institutional\ncapacity by forming water abstractor groups (WAGs) to\ndefend their existing water rights and build\ncommunication channels with the water regulator was\nconsidered essential to any future agricultural water\nstrategy. WAGs exist worldwide, for example in Spain,\nMexico, Peru, the Middle East, India, Nepal, Indonesia\nand the Philippines, many with a long and successful\nhistory. In most WAGs, farmers have faced water scarcity\nand decided to work together to minimize and share that\nscarcity in an equitable and sustainable manner. Despite\nthe different cultures, their operating principles have been\nshown to be very similar (Trawick, 2003), and recent\nstudies suggest that WAGs in England should be no\ndifferent in this regard.\nThe concept of promoting WAGs was also supported\nby the EA, which viewed them as a mechanism for better\ncommunications with its licensed abstractors. For\nexample, in eastern England there are 3,000 licensed\nirrigators \u2013 here the EA would prefer to deal with local\ngroups of abstractors rather than 3,000 individuals during\ntimes of water stress (drought). Although six WAGs\nalready operate in England \u2013 four in East Anglia, one in\nLincoln and another in Northumberland, there has been a\nlack of urgency among farmers to initiate new groups,\ndue to other more immediate commercial pressures,\nincluding regulation and uncertainties associated with EU\nCommon Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform (Rickard et al,\n2005). However, forming new WAGs is not\nstraightforward, as both technical and social conditions\nmust be right (Leathes et al, 2008). Dry years have high-\nlighted the risks of water security to crop production, but\n306 Outlook on AGRICULTURE Vol 38, No 4\nImproving irrigation efficiency in a temperate climate\nFigure 2. Location of spray irrigation abstraction licences in the\nAnglian region in 2008.\nNotes: CAMS = catchment abstraction management strategies;\nWRMU = water resources management units.\nsimilarly, wet summers (2007 and 2008) have lessened the\nrequirement to collaborate with neighbouring farmers.\nAnother drought may well provide the catalyst for new\ngroups, but waiting for that to happen is not necessarily\nthe most rational way forward.\nA fundamental question arose as to whether there was\na way of assisting farmers to form new WAGs when there\nwas no immediate crisis, and where to concentrate efforts.\nNew groups are most likely to form where irrigation\ndemand is high, where water resources are most\nconstrained and where farmers are most willing to\naddress the problem in a collective manner. A\ngeographical assessment was needed taking into account\nspatial and temporal variations in climate, land-use and\nirrigation practices (Knox and Weatherhead, 1999). Using\na geographical information system (GIS), the locations of\nabstraction points for agricultural irrigation relative to EA\ncatchments were first mapped (Figure 2). This highlighted\ncatchments in east Suffolk, north Norfolk and the Fens,\nwhere there is a high density of irrigation abstraction,\ncorresponding to areas where favourable climate and\nfertile soils support intensive horticultural production.\nThen by correlating the volumes of water abstracted in a\nrecent dry year (2003) against the spatial distribution of\n\u2018over-abstracted\u2019 areas (Figure 1), irrigation abstraction\n\u2018hot spots\u2019 were identified (Figure 3), where the formation\nof new WAGs was likely to be most successful. Such an\napproach would have relevance to many other countries\nwhere appropriate datasets are available.\nFigure 3. Identified spray irrigation abstraction \u2018hot spots\u2019 within\ncritical catchments in the Anglian region in 2008.\nIn a number of \u2018hot spots\u2019 WAGs have already been\nformed, so the key actions in this theme were to support\nthe formation of new WAGs in other \u2018hot spots\u2019 and also\nto help existing groups improve their water management\nskills. Strategic inputs would include advice and training\non group management and administration as well as\nraising knowledge of local water resource matters. New\ngroups would benefit from the experiences of the leaders\nof established groups, who would be encouraged to act as\nmentors. It is proposed that one new WAG is set up as a\npilot, and once established, further groups should be set\nup using the experience gained. The more mature groups\nwould be given support to develop into organizations\nwith greater autonomy and local influence on water\nmanagement.\nMaking best use of available water (Theme 2)\nThe second theme focuses on using the existing water\nmore wisely. Most irrigators already aim to do this\nbecause saving water usually also saves money through\nreducing pumping, storage and labour costs. But more\nneeds to be done to make better use of what is available,\nto obtain \u2018more crop per drop\u2019 (Luquet et al, 2005) or, even\nbetter, \u2018more value per drop\u2019. Internationally, irrigation\nhas a reputation for low efficiency (Molden, 2007), but\nirrigators in England use relatively little water by\ninternational standards, as the irrigation is supplemental,\nevapotranspiration rates are relatively low and there are\nMedium\nHigh\nVery high\nIrrigation abstraction hot-spots\n307Outlook on AGRICULTURE Vol 38, No 4\nImproving irrigation efficiency in a temperate climate\nno open canal networks or surface irrigation. However,\nthere is always scope for using less. Making the maximum\nuse of soil moisture and rainfall, knowing precisely where\nand when irrigation does have to be applied, and then\napplying it accurately and uniformly, are fundamental\nsteps on the \u2018pathway to efficiency\u2019.\nUsing existing supplies better \u2013 benchmarking and new\ntechnologies\nInternational experience suggests that irrigation efficiency\ncan be significantly improved by comparing how\nindividual farms perform against industry best practice,\nthrough a process termed \u2018benchmarking\u2019 (Malano and\nBurton, 2001). This typically involves the development of\nWeb-based systems, which enable farmers to input their\nirrigation data and to see how they compare against\nothers irrigating under similar circumstances. Data are\nsupplied anonymously to preserve commercial\nconfidentiality. Key performance indicators include\nirrigation abstraction (m3) and application (m3\/ha), crop\nproduction (t\/ha, \u00a3\/m3), business processes and environ-\nmental impact. Benchmarking would provide UK\nirrigators with a means of comparing how they are\nperforming relative to other growers, to help answer\nquestions such as \u2018How well am I doing?\u2019 \u2018How much\nbetter could I do?\u2019 and \u2018How do I do it?\u2019 One of the\nrecommendations of the strategy was to implement a\nbenchmarking tool within a key crop sector (for example,\npotatoes), before extending into other sectors. Successful\nmodels developed in Spain (Rodr\u00edguez D\u00edaz et al, 2008)\nand Australia (Malano and Davison, 2009) would inform\nthe process.\nEfficient irrigation also requires the adoption of best\nmanagement practices using appropriate equipment with\naccurate water scheduling. As a relatively small player\ninternationally, the UK irrigation industry needs to work\nwith and build on the experiences of others. New\ntechnologies and better ways of using them are best found\nby studying developments in related sectors (for example,\nsensor technology and control systems in the glasshouse\nindustry) and best practice in other countries, particularly\nthose with similar crops, agroclimates and water resource\nproblems. Those identified as most promising include:\n\u2022 precision application systems \u2013 optimizing\nperformance using equipment such as individually\nvalved sprinklers, intelligent rain-guns and booms, and\ntrickle irrigation (Knox and Weatherhead, 2005);\n\u2022 improved scheduling using wireless sensors and\/or\ninfrared technology (Vellidis et al, 2008);\n\u2022 reduced energy consumption by improving pump-\nsystem performance (Moreno et al, 2007); and\n\u2022 understanding the impacts of poor efficiency on\nirrigation uniformity and crop production (Lacey,\n2007).\nA significant part of this theme involves the identification\nof potential advances, assessment of their appropriate-\nness, and technology transfer. The work proposed\ncombines networking with industry organizations and\ngrowers to define needs, study missions to identify useful\nadvances elsewhere, detailed research studies on specific\ntechnologies and on-farm trials. The subsequent\ntechnology adaptation and technology transfer would\ninclude preparation of reports for grower audiences,\ngrower networks and seminars, and on-farm\ndemonstrations. Outreach and communication activities\nwould then be coordinated by the UK Irrigation\nAssociation working alongside relevant crop sector levy\nboards responsible for sustaining UK agricultural and\nhorticultural production. Similar initiatives are under way\nin Australia.\nMaking more water available \u2013 trading, sharing and\nconjunctive use\nEven in a very dry year, less than a third of all water\nlicensed for irrigation in England is actually abstracted.\nOf course, in some areas the water may not actually be\navailable when needed, for example, due to low river\nflows or low aquifer levels, and additional abstraction\nwould not be welcome from already over-abstracted\ncatchments. Nevertheless, there is significant scope to\nincrease the allocative efficiency of water for irrigation\nwithout causing environmental damage. In Australia,\ntrading has helped move water from low- to high-value\nproduction, maximizing the value of water abstracted\n(Zaman et al, 2009).\nTrading water permits (abstraction licences) is already\npossible in England, but can be administratively slow and\ncumbersome; renting the land with the water is widely\npractised to allow the long crop rotations required for\ncrops such as carrots. Sharing can involve joint licences or\nless formal exchange arrangements. Most UK irrigation\nsystems are independent, but linking systems enhances\nopportunities for conjunctive use of surface water,\ngroundwater and reservoirs, greatly increasing reliability.\nThis theme therefore involves identifying the real\nopportunities and issues involved in these initiatives \u2013 for\nexample, how to match buyers to sellers in critically\nwater-stressed catchments.\nThere are also opportunities for promoting shared\nreservoirs whereby neighbouring farmers share the\ninvestment and operating costs of a single larger reservoir,\nrather than many smaller ones. Here the strategy proposes\nresearch to identify the best ways to handle the legal,\ncontractual and environmental issues of shared reservoirs\nand their environmental and resource benefits.\nDeveloping a knowledge base (Theme 3)\nFarmers need to stay informed and have access to the\nlatest information at the right time if they are to remain\ncompetitive. The third theme involves developing a\nknowledge base to improve communication and\ndissemination of research. Experience in countries such as\nSpain has demonstrated the benefits of providing\ninformation on water management in formats that can be\nreadily accessed by farmers (Rodr\u00edguez D\u00edaz et al, 2005).\nOf course, UK irrigation is not on the scale of that in Spain\nor Australia, but a similar knowledge base that both\ncaptures existing information and provides a range of new\nmedia would significantly benefit the environmental\nsustainability and competitiveness of agribusinesses in\nEngland. It would also provide direct benefits to other\nstakeholders and the wider community, including those\nemployed in the food and farming industries, as well as\nlocal schools and agricultural colleges.\n308 Outlook on AGRICULTURE Vol 38, No 4\nImproving irrigation efficiency in a temperate climate\nDemonstration farms, Web-based information gateway\nand training\nExperience with organizations such as Linking\nEnvironment and Farming Marque (LEAF) has shown that\non-farm commercially operated demonstrations can be\nvery effective for highlighting and transferring new\nknowledge and experience between farmers.\nDemonstration farms for water can help promote good\nland and water stewardship, identify alternative\ninnovative approaches to adapting to water scarcity, and\nshowcase new irrigation technologies and practices. They\nprovide focal points for problem solving, networking and\nstaff training. They can also inform and educate a wide\nrange of other stakeholders about the role and importance\nof agriculture in the world of water. For example,\neducational field visits, guided tours and open days\nwould provide local agricultural colleges, schools and the\ngeneral public with opportunities to discover how water\nis an essential component in modern agri-food\nproduction, thereby helping to re-connect the public with\nthe farming community.\nThe farming industry also needs better access to the\nlatest information on water management. This includes\nguidelines on optimizing equipment, implementing best\nmanagement practices, identifying opportunities for water\nsaving, conducting water audits, and water policy and\nregulation. Most UK farmers use Internet services within\ntheir business, and so the Web and e-mail provide the\nideal vehicle to deliver high-impact media such as\nfactsheets, videos, programs, newsletters and research\nnotes. An Internet-based \u2018one-stop shop\u2019 for information\nand advice on water management is proposed to\ncontribute to skills development within the agri-food\nsector. This would also support the delivery of\nprofessional development training.\nAs part of the development of a knowledge base, a\nseries of information booklets for farmers covering water\nissues has been published. These have been funded by the\nwater regulatory authority and environmental protection\nand rural development agencies. The booklets cover\nsubjects including water efficiency, storage reservoirs,\nwater harvesting, WAGs, climate change, droughts and\nwater scarcity, and irrigation scheduling. They have been\ndistributed to registered irrigation abstractors across\nEngland and used in farmer training programmes. They\nhave also been very popular with the international\nfarming and scientific community (as evidenced by\ndownloads from the UK Irrigation Association Website);\nthis confirms that the approaches developed to cope with\nincreasing irrigation water scarcity in a humid\nenvironment are equally relevant in more arid regions of\nthe world.\nFinally, professional development training is needed\nfor both farmers and trainers. Farmers need to improve\ntheir technical knowledge in water management\ncontinually through workshops, short courses, technical\nmeetings and conferences. Initiatives to date have been\ngood, but limited in scope. In particular, they need\npromulgation across a much wider audience and to be\ntargeted at catchments where water resources are stressed\n(Figure 3). Additional capacity is also needed to deliver\nthis training. Most agricultural colleges do not have the\nrequired in-depth knowledge in agricultural and\nenvironmental water management; indeed, the land-based\ncurricula in most agricultural colleges now provide only\nvery basic coverage of such issues (Godwin et al, 2008).\nTraining of trainers will thus be needed to build capacity\nand develop appropriate course curricula and training\nmaterials.\nImplementing the strategy\nIn order to ensure that the strategy would be successfully\nimplemented, a road map for implementation was\ndeveloped to identify priorities and timescales. But the\nindustry consultations emphasized quite strongly that it\nneeded a \u2018champion\u2019 to promote and manage it. In\nEngland, the farming industry has many champions, but\nnot one for water. Most organizations are commodity- or\nbusiness-focused. For example, one levy board, the\nAgriculture and Horticulture Development Board\n(AHDB), represents the interests of growers in the cereals,\npotato, dairying, pig and horticultural sectors. Other\norganizations such as the National Farmers Union (NFU)\nrepresent agribusiness and land ownership interests.\nHowever, many of the stakeholders involved in the\ndevelopment of this water strategy recognized that all the\nefforts to reduce water wastage made by such\norganizations, though laudable, were disconnected. They\nare at best patchy and at worst lead to unnecessary\nduplication of effort, inefficient use of limited resources,\nand most importantly a fragmented and potentially weak\nlobby for the critical resource on which they all depend.\nIn this context, a water-saving centre or trust for\nagriculture was proposed to provide that focus, in much\nthe same way that carbon and energy trusts have been\nformed in other business sectors. It would bring\nstakeholders together and champion the efficient use of\nwater in agriculture, and would improve the potential for\nintegrating the strategy actions. The centre would also act\nas a catalyst for supporting the development of WAGs,\ncoordinate studies on key issues such as shared reservoirs\nand water trading, harmonize professional development\ntraining and manage the Web-based information gateway.\nWhere additional resources or technical expertise were\nneeded, the centre would commission specific studies in\nline with the water strategy. Although the establishment\nof such a centre was not a prerequisite for\nimplementation, it was the preferred mechanism to ensure\nstrategy uptake. Discussions between relevant regulators\nand stakeholders are under way to identify whether such\na centre or trust can be established.\nAn international perspective?\nThe issues presented here facing farmers in England are\nnot unique. They are similar to those in most other\ncountries that rely on irrigated agriculture to some degree\n\u2013 in both developed and developing countries. Most\nfarmers express concerns about the weakness of their\nnegotiating position when seeking water and their need\nfor a stronger \u2018political\u2019 and more cohesive voice to\nsupport investment in water for agriculture. They also\nexpress the need for information to support irrigation\nefficiency improvements and the desire to make best use\n309Outlook on AGRICULTURE Vol 38, No 4\nImproving irrigation efficiency in a temperate climate\nof available and limited water resources. In most\ncountries, they are the poor relation when it comes to\nsharing available water resources. These are themes now\nbeing discussed by the International Commission on\nIrrigation and Drainage (ICID), which represents some 80\ndifferent countries. These were also the main issues\npresented at the World Water Forum in Turkey in March\n2009 in support of a fair share of water for agriculture. So\nlessons learned here could well have resonance in many\nother countries well beyond the UK.\nAcknowledgments\nThis paper has arisen from research funded by the East of\nEngland Development Agency (EEDA), the European\nSocial Fund and the Environment Agency (EA).
