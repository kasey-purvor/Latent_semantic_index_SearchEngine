The regional changes reported here have the potential to affect the climatically \nsignificant ventilation of the global ocean abyss. \n \n 3\n1. Introduction \n \nImmediately east of Drake Passage, the Scotia Sea is a basin with rough bottom topography, and is \nseparated from the Weddell Sea to the south by the South Scotia Ridge (Figure 1).  The horizontal \nzonation of water masses in the Scotia Sea is dominated by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current \n(ACC) (Orsi et al., 1995).  This current has a banded structure, with the main fronts being (north-to-\nsouth) the SubAntarctic Front, Polar Front, and Southern ACC Front.  The southern limit of the \nACC is marked by the Southern Boundary, south of which are found the waters of the Weddell-\nScotia Confluence. These are characterised by low vertical gradients at mid-depths due to the \ninjection of dense waters that spill off the shelf close to the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula \n(Whitworth et al., 1994). \n \nThe Scotia Sea receives waters from both Drake Passage, via the ACC, and the Weddell Sea, via \nthe northern limb of the Weddell Gyre.  Water masses of Weddell Sea origin include Warm Deep \nWater (WDW; Table 1), characterised by a potential temperature (\u04e8) maximum near 500 m and a \nsalinity (S) maximum near 800 m.  WDW is derived from the Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) of \nthe ACC that is entrained into the eastern limb of the Weddell Gyre (Orsi et al., 1993), and \nthereafter advected cyclonically within the Gyre. \n \nWaters of Weddell Sea origin also include Weddell Sea Deep Water (WSDW; Table 1), the densest \nwater mass found in the Scotia Sea.  WSDW is an essential component of the Antarctic Bottom \nWater (AABW) that forms the abyssal layer of much of the world\u2019s oceans.  WSDW is formed by \nthe mixing of dense shelf waters with variants of WDW on the shelves and slopes of the western \nand southwestern Weddell Sea (Foster and Carmack, 1976; Gill, 1973; Gordon, 1998).  Different \n 4\ntypes of WSDW are found in the Weddell Sea reflecting distinct formation processes and regions.  \nThe outer rim of the gyre features relatively fresh and oxygen-rich WSDW compared with that \nfound closer to the centre of the gyre.  The enhanced ventilation is due to injection of relatively \nfresh shelf water found near the northern end of the Antarctic Peninsula (Gordon et al., 2001).  \nWSDW is underlain in the Weddell Sea by the denser Weddell Sea Bottom Water (WSBW; Table \n1), which forms via similar processes to WSDW but contains a higher proportion of dense shelf \nwaters.  WSBW is too dense to escape the Weddell Sea directly, and must first mix upwards into \nthe WSDW density class.  Within the Weddell Sea, WSDW can also incorporate recently ventilated \ndeep waters imported from the Indian Ocean sector to the east (Meredith et al., 2000). \n \nThe Scotia Sea (Figure 1) is the most direct route for WSDW to flow northward and contribute to \nthe global overturning circulation (Locarnini et al., 1993).  WSDW can enter the Scotia Sea via \ndeep gaps in the South Scotia Ridge, of which the ~3200-m deep Orkney Passage is the deepest \n(Gordon et al., 2001; Naveira Garabato et al., 2002b), or via gaps in the South Sandwich Island arc \n(Meredith et al., 2001; Naveira Garabato et al., 2002a).  The northward flow of WSDW on the \nwestern edge of the Orkney Passage derives from the more ventilated form of WSDW (Gordon et \nal., 2001).  Upon entering the Scotia Sea, WSDW can spread westward toward Drake Passage, \nhowever there is little or no net flow of this water mass through the narrowest part of the Passage \ninto the Pacific Ocean (Gordon, 1966; Sievers and Nowlin, 1984; Nowlin and Zenk, 1988).  \nWSDW exits the Scotia Sea primarily in the vicinity of the ~3200-m deep Georgia Passage, \nsoutheast of South Georgia (Figure 1). \n \nUpon leaving the Scotia Sea, WSDW spreads northwards into the Georgia Basin, whence it can \ncontinue northward into the Argentine Basin or recirculate southeastward back toward the Weddell \n 5\nSea.  Conventionally, WSDW is divided into Upper and Lower components in this region (Table 1) \n(Arhan et al., 1999; Meredith et al., 2001).  The division between Upper and Lower WSDW \n(established by Arhan et al. (1999) and used here) is such that Upper WSDW is able to flow \nthrough the Scotia Sea to reach the Georgia Basin, whereas Lower WSDW is topographically \nconstrained to enter the Georgia Basin via the eastern side of the South Sandwich Islands (Figure \n1). The direction of abyssal Lower WSDW flow at Georgia Passage was inferred to have reversed \nbetween 1995 and 1999, with the flow being northeastward out of the Scotia Sea prior to 1995, but \nthen changing to be southwestward into the Scotia Sea (Meredith et al., 2001). \n \nVarious changes have been reported in the properties of water masses originating from the Weddell \nSea.  Analysis of a long compilation of hydrographic data revealed that the coldest WDW was \nassociated with the Weddell Polynya years of the 1970s (Robertson et al., 2002).  Subsequently, this \nwater mass warmed at a rate of around 0.012 (\u00b1 0.007) \u00baC yr-1 up to the 1990s.  This warming was \nnot compensated by a salinity increase, with the WDW becoming less dense as a result.  The Scotia \nSea exhibited a warming of WDW of around 0.1-0.2 \u00baC between 1995 and 1999, as changes \noriginating in the Weddell Sea arrived (Meredith et al., 2001), however more recent data from close \nto the Greenwich Meridian in the Weddell Sea revealed a cooling of around 0.05 \u00baC between 1998 \nand 2003 after the end of the warming signal (Fahrbach et al., 2004).  Tentative explanations for \nthese changes include a change in CDW properties in the ACC (e.g. Gille, 2002) combined with \nvariations in the rate of inflow of this water to the Weddell Gyre.   \n \nWeddell Sea temperature profiles suggest warmer WSDW between 1500 and 3500 m  in the 1990s \ncompared with the 1970s (Robertson et al., 2002).  However, high variability in the data prevented \nidentification of a well-defined trend.  Relatively little change in WSDW properties in the Weddell \n 6\nSea was evident during 1990 \u2013 2003, with variations being close to the detection level (Fahrbach et \nal., 2004).  The areas from which data were collected for that study are, however, likely to \nemphasise basin-wide bulk changes in properties rather than changes in the recently-ventilated \nforms of WSDW in the boundary currents at the periphery of the sea. The comparative stability of \nWSDW properties contrasts with the continuous warming (by ~0.025 \u00baC) experienced by WSBW \nbetween 1989 and 2003 (Fahrbach et al., 2004). \n \nTemperature changes in the bottom waters spreading northward in the Atlantic Ocean from the \nWeddell Sea are apparent all the way to the equator.  Directly downstream from the Scotia Sea, in \nthe Argentine Basin, a comparison of hydrographic data collected in 1989 to data from 1980\u201387 \nshowed that the coldest abyssal layer warmed significantly in that interval (Coles et al., 1996).  Also \nin the Argentine Basin, comparison of 2005 and 1989 hydrographic section data revealed a further \n~0.05 \u00b0C warming of the abyssal layer (Johnson and Doney, 2006).  In the Vema Channel, the \ndeepest conduit between the Argentine Basin and the Brazil Basin to the north, the coldest bottom \nwaters have warmed by as much as 2.8 \u00d7 10-3 \u00b0C yr-1 from 1991 through to 2006, after being \nrelatively stable from 1972 to 1991 (Zenk and Morozov, 2007).  In the Brazil Basin, the abyssal \nlayers warmed by ~0.04 \u00b0C between 1989 and 2005 (Johnson and Doney, 2006).  Finally, at the \nequator, bottom \u04e8 values increased by nearly 0.1 \u00b0C between 1993 and 1999 (Andri\u00e9 et al., 2003). \nThese changes relate to abyssal temperatures, and whilst it is important to note that there are \ndifferences in bottom temperatures and lateral bottom temperature gradients between each of these \nlocations, the order of magnitude and timing of the changes are suggestive of a decadal warming \ntrend propagating northward in the South Atlantic. \n \n 7\nIn this paper, we use repeat hydrographic data to examine the evolution of the water mass properties \nand circulation of Weddell Sea-derived waters in the eastern Scotia Sea over a recent decade (1995 \n\u2013 2005), and investigate the causes of the observed changes.  Given these waters\u2019 fundamental \ncontribution to the deepest layers of the global overturning circulation, it is important to monitor \nand ultimately identify the causes of their variability.  \n \n2. Methods \n \nHydrographic data were collected from three cruises in the eastern Scotia Sea that occupied \nvirtually identical tracks (Figure 2).  Each of these ran northward from the South Scotia Ridge along \n~31\u00baW, then diverted at ~58\u00baS toward the island of South Georgia (Figure 1). The first section was \nconducted in April 1995 from the British Antarctic Survey vessel RRS James Clark Ross, and was a \ncomponent of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) A23 section (Heywood and King, \n2002).  The second section was conducted from the same vessel in April 1999 (Naveira Garabato et \nal., 2002a), and the third was conducted in January 2005 from the NOAA ship Ronald H. Brown, as \npart of the U.S. CLIVAR\/CO2 Repeat Hydrography Program (Johnson and Doney, 2006). \n \nMeredith et al. (2001) described the methods and data for the first two of these sections in detail.  \nTo summarise, the 1995 data were collected with a Neil Brown MKIIIb conductivity-temperature-\ndepth (CTD) profiler, with S data being calibrated relative to IAPSO P-series standard seawater \nusing bottle salts collected with a 24-bottle rosette.  The accuracy of this data is 0.001\u00baC for \u04e8 and \n0.002 for S.  The 1999 data were collected and calibrated in the same manner but using a Neil \nBrown MKIIIc CTD, with comparable accuracies achieved.  The 2005 data were collected using a \nSeaBird Electronics (SBE) 9plus CTD fitted with SBE3 temperature sensors and SBE4 conductivity \n 8\nsensors, and with discrete samples obtained using a 36-position rosette.  The accuracy of the \u04e8 and \nS data from 2005 are 0.001\u00baC and 0.002 or better, respectively (Johnson and Doney, 2006). \n \n3. Zonation and water masses \n \nVertical sections of \u04e8, S and neutral density (\u03b3n) are presented in Figures 3-5 respectively for each \nof the years. The major feature of horizontal zonation along this line is the Southern Boundary, \nfound at ~58.5\u00baS on the 1995 section, ~59\u00baS on the 1999 section, and between 58.5 and 59\u00baS on the \n2005 section.  Narrow eddy-like features containing water from south of the Southern Boundary are \nseen in the 1995 and 1999 sections at stations 45 and 111 (around 57\u00baS and 57.5\u00baS respectively) \n(Meredith et al., 2001).  The Southern ACC Front is present at the northern end of the sections, \nclose to stations 50, 118 and 101 in 1995, 1999 and 2005, respectively. \n \nNorth of the Southern Boundary, the sections are occupied by the ACC\u2019s poleward flank, in which \nvertical \u04e8 and S maxima indicate the cores of the upper and lower components of the CDW \n(Figures 3 and 4, respectively). South of the Southern Boundary lies the Weddell-Scotia \nConfluence; this features WDW centred around 500 m, identifiable as the vertical \u04e8 maximum \n(Figure 3).  WDW of \u03b3n < 28.20 kg m-3 is constrained to lie south of the Southern Boundary, except \nfor its presence in the narrow eddy-like features noted above.  A denser form of WDW is observed \nfarther north at greater depths (> 500m), and has its origins in the modification of Southeast Pacific \nDeep Water by mixing with Weddell deep waters (Naveira Garabato et al., 2002a). Beneath the \nWDW and CDW on the section lies WSDW, here defined as waters of \u03b3n > 28.26 kg m-3 (Figure 5).  \nThis layer resides below ~1800 m at the southern end of the section, thins northwards, and \ndisappears at around 55.5-56\u00baS.   \n 9\n \n4. Variability in water mass properties and circulation \n4.1 Warm Deep Water variability \n \nThe WDW layer south of the Southern Boundary exhibits substantial variability in \u04e8 and S \nmeasured during the three cruises (Figure 6).  In 1995, the peak WDW \u04e8 value encountered was \nclose to 0.41\u00baC, with the majority of stations showing WDW core \u04e8 values of 0.35 \u2013 0.40\u00baC.  In the \n1999 occupation of the section, the WDW core \u04e8 values were all much higher than this, from 0.50 \n\u2013 0.65\u00baC.  In the 2005 section, the WDW core \u04e8 had decreased again, with values below 0.45\u00baC.  \nThese changes are reflected in WDW maximum S values also, which increased by ~0.004 between \n1995 and 1999, before decreasing by a similar amount through to 2005 (Figure 6).  Note that there \nare some changes in the lateral position of the Southern Boundary in the sections (e.g. Figure 3), \nhowever our comparison considers only the waters south of this feature for each of the years, thus \nthe changes we see cannot be due to such movements.   \n \n4.2 Weddell Sea Deep Water \n \nVertical sections of \u03b3n (Figure 5) indicate that the volume of WSDW (\u03b3n > 28.26 kg m-3) decreased \nfrom 1995 to 1999, and decreased again from 1999 to 2005.  In particular, surfaces of \u03b3n > 28.26 kg \nm-3 appear to sink progressively, and their intersections with the seabed move southward, between \n1995 and 2005.  As an example, \u03b3n = 28.30 kg m-3 intersected the seabed close to station 47 in 1995, \ni.e. around 56.4\u00baS.  In 1999, this surface intersected the seabed around 56.8\u00baS (station 113), and in \n2005 its intersection was close to 57.4\u00baS (station 61). \n \n 10\nAlthough different station positioning among the years (most notably 2005; Figure 2) makes \nstation-by-station comparisons problematic, further indications of this shift can be obtained by \nconsideration of vertical \u04e8 and S profiles from north of the Southern Boundary (Figure 7).  The \ndeeper profile depths in 2005 are a reflection of the different station positioning in this year.  This \ncomplication notwithstanding, the 2005 stations are all warmer and saltier than the 1995 stations by \naround 0.1\u00baC and 0.005, respectively.  The 1999 stations are intermediate, and overlap with both \n1995 and 2005.  The changes are largely density compensating, such that the \u04e8 \u2013 S curves from \nthese stations are not significantly different within the accuracy level of the S measurements, except \nthat the densest water present becomes progressively warmer and saltier (not shown). \n \nSouth of the Southern Boundary there is a somewhat different pattern of change in \u04e8 within the \nWSDW (Figure 8).  The warming of around 0.05\u00baC is present between 1995 and 1999, as discussed \npreviously (Meredith et al., 2001).  However, subsequent to this there are no further significant \nchanges between 1999 and 2005, with \u04e8 values remaining constant on pressure surfaces.  The \nchanges in S suggest a possible shift towards saltier WSDW during the sequence of observations \n(Figure 8, lower panel), but it is small compared with the accuracy of the measurements. \n \n4.3 Lower Weddell Sea Deep Water variability \n \nAs with WSDW as a whole, there is a reduction in Lower WSDW volume during the sequence of \nmeasurements, though it is most notable between 1999 and 2005 for this layer.  In 1995, the \nnorthern terminus of this water mass (defined as \u03b3n > 28.31 kg m-3; Figure 5) was near 57\u00baS, before \nmoving slightly southward to ~57.25\u00baS in 1999, then farther southward than 58\u00baS in 2005. Within \nthe Lower WSDW, an inflection in the \u04e8 \u2013 S relation at \u03b3n = 28.31 kg m-3 is present in the 1999 \n 11\ndata, with the curves below this level diverting saltier, but is absent from the 1995 and 2005 data \n(Figure 9).  The 1999 curves thus reflect the presence of an additional water mass in the Scotia Sea \nthat was absent in the other years, namely a thin, abyssal layer of comparatively salty Lower \nWSDW that entered the Scotia Sea via Georgia Passage and possibly other deep gaps in the South \nSandwich Island arc (Meredith et al., 2001) (Figure 1).  To reach these gaps, this water mass flows \nnorthward on the eastern side of the South Sandwich Islands, and its southward and westward entry \nto the Scotia Sea in 1999 contrasts with the 1995 and 2005 results which indicate that the deepest \nlayer of Lower WSDW had crossed the South Scotia Ridge into the Scotia Sea instead. The \u04e8 \u2013 S \ninflection is not evident north of the Southern Boundary in 1999, or south of the Southern Boundary \nin either of the other years.  The 1999 pattern (an inflection south of the Southern Boundary but \nabsent to the north) indicates that the Southern Boundary constitutes a dynamical barrier that plays \nan important role in controlling the spreading of Lower WSDW into and within the Scotia Sea.   \n \n5. Discussion \n5.1. Warm Deep Water \n \nThe pattern of \u04e8 and S variations in WDW in the Scotia Sea is qualitatively consistent with changes \nobserved further south in the Weddell Sea (Fahrbach et al., 2004; Robertson et al., 2002), with \nwarming and salinification up to the mid- and late-1990s followed by a subsequent cooling and \nfreshening.  These combined results are strongly suggestive of large-scale changes in the WDW \nproperties in the Weddell Gyre being fed through to the Scotia Sea from upstream following the \ngeneral circulation, with transit times of roughly a few years between the southern Weddell and \nScotia Seas.  We note that the ~0.03\u00baC and ~0.002 increases in WDW \u04e8 and S values observed \nduring the late 1990s by Fahrbach et al. (2004) (their Figure 5) at the Greenwich Meridian in the \n 12\nWeddell Sea are distinctly less than the increases presented here between 1995 and 1999 in the \nScotia Sea, and similarly the decrease in \u04e8 of ~0.05\u00baC in the Weddell Sea after the turn of the \ncentury is less than the cooling of WDW in the Scotia Sea between 1999 and 2005.  However, the \nWeddell Sea figures are based on basin-wide averages that integrate some complex patterns of \nwarming and cooling (Fahrbach et al., 2004), thus the derived magnitudes of the changes here are \nexpected to be smaller.  \n \nAn analysis of WDW \u04e8 changes in \u201cinflowing\u201d and \u201coutflowing\u201d regions of the Weddell Gyre \nshowed WDW \u04e8 peaking in 1995 in the inflowing region, with more recent values falling by \naround 0.2\u00baC through to 1999 (Robertson et al., 2002).  In the outflowing region, a large scatter in \nWDW \u04e8 values during the late 1990s made trends in this area hard to identify. The magnitudes of \nthe changes in the WDW values in the Scotia Sea we present here are somewhat less than the long-\nterm (~30 year) warming trends seen in the WDW in the Weddell Sea (Robertson et al., 2002).  \nThis latter time series includes several instances of cooling within the general upward trend, and it \nis unclear whether the recent cooling seen in the Weddell Sea (Fahrbach et al., 2004) is a reversal of \nthe long-term warming trend or another instance of interannual variability against a background of \ncontinuing rising temperatures.   \n \nWith regard to the timing of the peak WDW temperatures in the Weddell and Scotia Seas, the \nsparse temporal sampling in the latter precludes clear identification of the year of highest \ntemperatures, and thus we cannot be precise concerning a lag between the two basins. \nNotwithstanding, the connection between WDW properties in the Weddell Sea and Scotia Sea \nestablished here implies that continued changes within the Weddell Sea are likely to be reflected as \nchanges in the Scotia Sea in years to come. \n 13\n \n5.2. Weddell Sea Deep Water \n \nThe changes identified in WSDW in the Scotia Sea are complex, and are summarised here by three \nmain observations:- \n1) North of the Southern Boundary, WSDW warmed by around 0.05 \u00baC between 1995 and \n1999, and again by the same amount between 1999 and 2005.  A concurrent small \nsalinification (0.005) occurred during the 1995-2005 period.  The overall volume of WSDW \nin this part of the Scotia Sea decreased through the sequence of measurements. \n2) South of the Southern Boundary, a comparable level of warming was seen between 1995 \nand 1999, but there was no significant warming between 1999 and 2005, and no significant \nsalinity change was detected.   \n3) Within the Lower WSDW layer, changes in circulation were observed, with the densest \nwaters crossing the South Scotia Ridge prior to the 1995 and 2005 sections, but entering the \nScotia Sea from its eastern and northeastern flanks prior to 1999. \n \nThe observations presented here are best explained by a superposition of a large-scale decadal trend \ntoward higher \u04e8 and S in the WSDW of the northern Weddell Sea, and shorter-period (interannual) \nvariability in the export of the densest classes of WSDW to the Scotia Sea (see below).  There are \ntwo factors that dictate the degrees to which these processes combine to control the observed \nproperties of WSDW in the Scotia Sea, namely the residence times of different classes of WSDW in \nthe basin, and the Southern Boundary\u2019s role as a dynamical barrier to the northward spreading of \nthis water mass.  \n \n 14\nThe mean residence time of a particular class of WSDW in the Scotia Sea is the characteristic \nperiod over which the properties of inflowing waters are averaged.  This period determines the \ntimescales of variability that the class of WSDW exhibits, and hence indicates the degree to which \nthe variability could be aliased by temporally sparse sampling.  Mean residence times (Table 2) are \ncalculated here by dividing the volume of each WSDW density class within the basin by the volume \ntransport of that density class over the South Scotia Ridge (Heywood et al., 2002; Naveira Garabato \net al., 2003).  These suggest that the overall WSDW layer in the Scotia Sea is renewed on average \nevery ~5 years, whereas the Lower WSDW sublayer is flushed more rapidly (around every 3 years).  \nThe densest classes of WSDW present in the Scotia Sea (here taken as \u03b3n > 28.35 kg m-3) are \nrenewed on approximately annual timescales.  These are found only south of the Southern \nBoundary, and the difference in mean residence times for these classes compared with WSDW \noverall reflects the role of the Southern Boundary as a dynamical barrier to the northward flow of \nthe water mass. The time intervals between the sections used here is comparable to the mean \nWSDW residence time in the Scotia Sea, but is significantly longer than that of the densest WSDW \nclasses.  The variability in denser WSDW properties is thus likely to be aliased within the \nhydrographic data, whereas the changes in WSDW characteristics north of the Southern Boundary \nwill be well represented.  \n \n5.2.1. Observation (1): continuous warming and salinification of WSDW north of the Southern \nBoundary \n \nKnowing the potential extent of aliasing associated with our sampling interval allows us to \nelucidate which of the two aforementioned processes (a large-scale decadal trend toward higher \u04e8 \nand S in the WSDW of the northern Weddell Sea, and interannual variability in the export of the \n 15\ndensest classes of WSDW to the Scotia Sea) may explain each of our observed WSDW changes.  \nThe decadal trend alone may account for the first observation, because the residence time \ncalculation indicates that WSDW north of Southern Boundary reflects long-term changes in the \nproperties of the WSDW exported from the Weddell Sea. \n \nSeveral previous studies (Andri\u00e9 et al., 2003; Coles et al., 1996; Johnson and Doney, 2006; Zenk \nand Morozov, 2007) have documented a warming at a comparable rate in the WSDW in the South \nAtlantic as far north as the equator, consistent with the bulk warming of WSDW observed here \n\u201cupstream\u201d in the Scotia Sea.  Decadal warming of the recently ventilated WSDW in the Weddell \nSea has not been unambiguously demonstrated, due to the lack of a long time series of observations \nin the boundary currents directly upstream of the overflow regions at the South Scotia Ridge, but \nwe note here that such a warming would be compatible with the observed decadal-scale warming of \nWSBW during the 1989-2003 period (Fahrbach et al., 2004). WSBW contains a significant \nproportion of recently-ventilated shelf waters, and is not directly exported from the Weddell Sea \nafter formation, so changes within this layer are very possibly echoed by changes within the \nboundary current of WSDW (which contains a higher proportion of recently-ventilated waters than \nthe recirculated WSDW in the central Weddell Sea) that feeds the Scotia Sea.  \n \nAs with the warming trend, a potential salinification of the recently-ventilated WSDW in the \nnorthern Weddell Sea has not been shown unambiguously due to lack of appropriate observations. \nRobertson et al. (2002) were unable to deduce significant temperature trends for WSDW in the \nnorthwestern Weddell Sea due to large scatter in their data, and the same would appear true for \nsalinity (the change of salinity we observe in the Scotia Sea, around 0.005, is small compared to the \nscatter shown in Figure 9 of Robertson et al. (2002), for example). \n 16\n \n5.2.2. Observation (2): cessation of warming of WSDW south of the Southern Boundary after 1999 \n \nMean residence times for WSDW density classes that lie exclusively south of the Southern \nBoundary are of order 1 year.  Therefore, in the southern Scotia Sea, the impact of the decadal-scale \nwarming trend discussed in 5.2.1 is likely to be superposed on interannual variability in the WSDW \noverflows of the South Scotia Ridge. The mechanisms controlling the variability in these overflows \nwere outlined by Meredith et al. (2001), and are illustrated here schematically (Figure 10). It has \nbeen argued that changes in the intensity of the baroclinic component of the Weddell Gyre \ncirculation (most likely associated with changes in integrated wind stress curl over the Weddell \nSea) will affect the depth levels at which isopycnals intersect with the South Scotia Ridge, and \nhence determine the densest class of WSDW able to overflow into the Scotia Sea.  A decrease \n(increase) in the density of the deepest layer of WSDW overflowing the ridge will result in a \nwarming (cooling) on pressure surfaces within the Scotia Sea, but no discernable change on density \nsurfaces. Accompanying S changes will occur, but of a magnitude comparable to the level of \ndetectability.  In the context of this conceptual model, a spin-up of the Weddell Gyre between 1995 \nand 1999 followed by a spin-down prior to 2005 would explain our pattern of observations, with the \nabsence of significant changes south of the Southern Boundary between 1999 and 2005 being due \nto the opposing effects of interannual variability associated with Weddell Gyre intensity (cooling) \nand longer-term (decadal) warming. \n \nThe extent to which the baroclinicity of the Weddell Gyre varies is poorly known, but there is some \nevidence that changes of the magnitude required to explain our observations occur.  One piece is \nprovided by a 6-year time series of water mass properties collected with moored instrumentation \n 17\nimmediately upstream of the Orkney Passage (Figure 1) as part of the CORC \/ ARCHES \nprogramme (Visbeck et al., 2001).  Although this mooring does not cover the densities that typify \nthe WSDW in the Scotia Sea, and is of shorter duration than the time period covered by our \nsections, it does provide useful information on the characteristic variability in density on a depth \nsurface exhibited by WSDW in the boundary current of the northern Weddell Sea. The records \nshow that, at three different levels within 500 dbar of the seabed in water depths of around 3059m, \npronounced excursions of order 0.005 kg m-3 on interannual timescales (around 1-3 years) are \nprominent within the core of recently ventilated WSDW in the northern Weddell Gyre (Figure 11).  \nThe interannual changes in density show a large degree of vertical coherence, consistent with these \nsignals being due to variations in the baroclinicity of the gyre.  Hydrographic profiles from this \nregion indicate that a change in density at the mooring of order 0.005 kg m-3 corresponds to a \nchange in isopycnal depth of around 100 m, with associated changes of approximately 0.04\u00b0C in \u04e8 \nand 0.002 in S on a pressure surface.  These changes are comparable with the variability in \u04e8 and S \nobserved in the mooring data on interannual timescales (Gordon et al., in preparation, 2007).  An \ninterannual perturbation to the baroclinicity of the Weddell Gyre of the magnitude implied by the \nmooring density data would be sufficient to account for the cessation of the warming of the WSDW \nsouth of the Southern Boundary after 1999, whilst resulting in no detectable change in S, in \nagreement with our observations. \n \nFurther evidence for variability in the intensity of the baroclinic Weddell Gyre circulation is given \nby Martinson and Iannuzzi (2003), who use available hydrographic data from across the gyre to \ninvestigate periods of spin-up and spin-down during the last quarter of the 20th century.  These \nauthors note significant changes in the gyre\u2019s baroclinicity on interannual timescales, which they \nrelate to variations in the phase of the El Ni\u00f1o \/ Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon.  During \n 18\nan El Ni\u00f1o event, the Weddell Gyre was deduced to have spun-up in response to changing winds, \nand the converse was inferred in response to La Ni\u00f1a.  If this relationship applies consistently, as \nMartinson and Iannuzzi (2003) propose, it might suggest that the apparently anomalous conditions \nthat we observed in the Scotia Sea during 1999 could be connected to the very strong El Ni\u00f1o event \nthat occurred in 1997\/98, allowing for a 1-2 year lag for baroclinic spin-up and for the anomalous \nWSDW that crosses the South Scotia Ridge to spread to the location of our section. \n \n5.2.3. Observation (3): changes in Lower WSDW circulation \n \nThe change in circulation of Lower WSDW between 1995 and 1999 (Meredith et al., 2001) was \nseen to subsequently reverse up to 2005.  This pattern of change is consistent with observation 2 \n(section 5.2.2), and is similarly controlled by variations in the intensity of the Weddell Gyre (see \nFigure 10).  The increase in the density of the deepest WSDW overflowing the South Scotia Ridge \nassociated with the baroclinic spin-down of the Weddell Gyre after 1999 would have precluded the \nimport of the more saline variety of Lower WSDW through Georgia Passage and gaps in the South \nSandwich Arc. (A denser outflow through these gaps would act to block the southwestward flow of \nLWSDW through Georgia Passage into the Scotia Sea abyss). Consequently, 1999 was the only \nyear of the three that showed the influence of the more saline type of Lower WSDW, due to the \nreversals in direction of abyssal flow at the northeastern and eastern edges of the Scotia Sea before \nand after this date. \n \n6. Conclusions \n \n 19\nA hydrographic section in the eastern Scotia Sea of the Southern Ocean was occupied three times \n(in April 1995, April 1999 and February 2005), and significant changes in water mass properties \nwere observed. The WDW south of the Southern Boundary warmed and salinified between 1995 \nand 1999, then cooled and freshened through to 2005.  These changes appear to be the consequence \nof decadal-scale variability in the properties of this water mass upstream in the Weddell Sea, \npropagated into the Scotia Sea via the Weddell Gyre.  The likely influence of the Weddell Polynya \non WDW properties has been highlighted (Robertson et al., 2002), and it has been argued that this \nevent may have been triggered by anomalous atmospheric forcing associated with the Southern \nHemisphere Annular Mode, and possibly linked to a La Ni\u00f1a event (Gordon et al., 2007).  In the \ncontext of these studies, our results indicate that climate-scale forcing over the Weddell Sea has \nimpacts that are seen outside the region as the variations induced are propagated northward. \n \nWe have reported several changes to the WSDW flowing through the Scotia Sea.  North of the \nSouthern Boundary, WSDW warmed and salinified between 1995 and 2005, whereas south of the \nSouthern Boundary the warming was only observed through to 1999.  Reversals in the abyssal \ncirculation of the densest classes of WSDW were also observed.  The observed WSDW changes are \nbest explained by a superposition of a large-scale decadal trend toward higher \u04e8 and S in the \nWSDW of the northern Weddell Sea, and shorter-period (interannual) variability in the export of \nthe densest classes of WSDW to the Scotia Sea. \n \nWe have argued that the interannual variability in the export of WSDW to the Scotia Sea is likely \nrelated to changes in the baroclinicity of the Weddell Gyre.  These changes may be controlled by \ncyclonic atmospheric forcing over the Gyre, which has been shown to be modulated by ENSO on \ninterannual timescales (see Martinson and Iannuzzi (2003) and references therein).  We conjecture \n 20\nthat if the interannual modulation of WSDW export by ENSO were also active on longer (decadal) \ntimescales (as implied by the work of Martinson and Iannuzzi, 2003), it may contribute to the \nWSDW warming observed throughout the South Atlantic.  ENSO has undergone long-period \nchanges in recent decades, with a higher preponderance of El Ni\u00f1o events since the 1970s; this \nwould enhance the Weddell Gyre\u2019s baroclinicity, and hinder the export of the coldest WSDW. \n \nThe WDW and WSDW changes that we observe have potential climatic consequences that \ntranscend regional scales.  For example, if the decrease in volume of WSDW in the Scotia Sea \nbetween 1995 and 2005 is indicative of a longer-period trend, this will have implications for \ncirculation and climate in much of the world ocean.  Warming of the abyssal layer has been \nreported for recent decades as far north as the equator in the western Atlantic Ocean.  This warming \nis evidence of a major change in the properties of the lower limb of the oceanic overturning \ncirculation, originating in the Weddell Sea and transiting through the Scotia Sea. \n \nTo put some of these changes in perspective, climate models suggest that the Earth's energy \nimbalance is currently about 0.85 (\u00b10.15) W m-2, with the oceans absorbing a large fraction of that \nheat gain (Hansen et al., 2005).  The evolution of the heat content of WDW in the eastern Scotia \nSea is equivalent to a local heat gain of ~3 W m-2 between 1995 and 1999, and a similar local heat \nloss through to 2005 (c.f. the local heat gain of 4 W m-2 implied by the warming of the Weddell Sea \nbetween 1977 and 2001; Smedsrud, 2005). In turn, the temperature increase of the WSDW layer in \nthe eastern Scotia Sea between 1995 and 2005 associated with the decadal warming trend yields a \nlocal heat gain of ~1 W m-2.  If the vertical profile of warming rate below 3000 m between 60\u00b0S and \nthe equator in the western basins of the South Atlantic for recent decades (Johnson and Doney, \n2006) were typical of the entire global ocean abyss, it would account for ~0.2 W m-2 of the Earth\u2019s \n 21\nenergy imbalance.  Abyssal Pacific warming rates are smaller (Johnson et al., 2007), nonetheless \nabyssal water temperature variations such as those presented here are not only of high regional \nimportance, but may also contribute significantly to the global heat budget.\n 22\nAcknowledgements \n \nThese analyses would not have been possible without the effort of many people at sea and ashore to \ngather, calibrate, and process the hydrographic section data analyzed here.

Area, volume, inflowing volume transport and mean residence time of three overlapping \ndensity classes of WSDW with varying upper boundaries.  Areas and volumes estimated by \nobjective mapping of density profiles obtained from historical atlas data, the three sections used in \nthis study, and six occupations of a transect across Drake Passage.  Method described more \nextensively in Heywood et al. (2002).  Uncertainties in the areas and volumes estimated ad hoc by \nvarying objective mapping parameters.  Volume transports over the South Scotia Ridge estimated \nfrom the box inverse model solution of Naveira Garabato et al. (2003).  Errors correspond to one \nstandard deviation uncertainties from the inverse model.  Mean residence times calculated by \ndividing volumes by volume transports.  \n"}
