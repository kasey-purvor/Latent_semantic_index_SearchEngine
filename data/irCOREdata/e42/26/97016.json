The motion of vortices in an anisotropic superconductor is considered. For a system of\nwell-separated vortices, each vortex is found to obey a law of motion analogous to the local induction\napproximation, in which velocity of the vortex depends upon the local curvature and orientation. A\nsystem of closely packed vortices is then considered, and a mean \feld model is formulated in which\nthe individual vortex lines are replaced by a vortex density.\nKey words. superconductivity, Ginzburg{Landau equations, mean-\feld, anisotropic, high-\ntemperature\nAMS subject classi\fcation. 82D55\nPII. S0036139995282682\n1. Introduction. Type II superconductors are characterized by the appearance\nof line singularities known as normal \flaments or vortices. These singularities carry a\nmagnetic \feld, and associated with this magnetic \feld is a circulating superconduct-\ning current (hence the term vortex). These structures are immensely important in\ntechnological applications, since any superconductor which is in the presence of a high\nmagnetic \feld will contain millions of vortices. In particular, it is important to under-\nstand how vortices move under the influence of an electric current, since movement\ncauses dissipation, which leads to an electrical resistance.\nMoreover, since there will be many millions of vortices in any reasonably sized\nsample, it is important to be able to formulate a mean-\feld, or averaged model, in\nwhich the individual vortices have been replaced by a vortex density, or vorticity.\nRecently, in [6], [4] both the law of motion of vortices and a mean-\feld model\nhave been formulated, using the Ginzburg{Landau theory of superconductivity [11],\n[3], [8] as a starting point.\nMany of the high-temperature superconducting materials, however, do not \ft\nimmediately into the Ginzburg{Landau framework. A typical characteristic of these\nmaterials is that of a layered structure, with superconducting planes being separated\nby regions of normal (nonsuperconducting) material. Thus, at the very least, these\nmaterials are highly anisotropic, with di\u000berent characteristics across planes to those\nin plane.\nTwo models have been proposed to deal with such materials. The \frst is the\nLawrence{Doniach model, in which the individual planes are modelled by the\nGinzburg{Landau theory and coupled via Josephson tunnelling between the planes,\nleading to a system of di\u000berential-di\u000berence equations [15]. An alternative model is\nthe anisotropic Ginzburg{Landau model, which is a variation of the Ginzburg{Landau\ntheory which takes account of the anisotropy of the high-Tc materials. It has been\nshown recently in [5] that in the limit of strong Josephson coupling, the Lawrence{\n\u0003Received by the editors March 8, 1995; accepted for publication (in revised form) October 23,\n1996. The research of the \frst author was supported by a British Nuclear Electric Research fellowship.\nThe research of the second author was supported by a Science and Engineering Research Council\nstudentship.\nhttp:\/\/www.siam.org\/journals\/siap\/58-2\/28268.html\nyMathematical Institute, Oxford University, 24-29 St. Giles\u2019, Oxford OX1 3LB, UK (chapman@\nmaths.ox.ac.uk).\n587\n588 S. CHAPMAN AND G. RICHARDSON\nDoniach model approaches the anisotropic Ginzburg{Landau model as the separation\nbetween the planes tends to zero.\nThe aim of the present work is to extend the analysis in [6] and [4] to the case of an\nanisotropic superconductor. In section 2 we introduce the anisotropic time-dependent\nGinzburg{Landau equations written down by Genkin and Mel\u2019nikov [10]. In section\n3 we perform an asymptotic analysis of a system of well-separated vortices and derive\nthe law of motion as an anisotropic version of the local induction approximation. In\nsection 4 we consider a system of densely packed vortices and formulate a mean-\feld\nmodel in which the law of motion of vortices is derived from an asymptotic analysis\nof each vortex core. In section 5 we consider some examples of vortex motion under\nthe law derived in section 3. Finally, in section 6 we present our conclusions.\n2.

Self-induced vortex motion. Before we begin our analysis of vortex solu-\ntions of (24){(26) we make two further assumptions concerning the remaining param-\neters. First we will consider only the case where m1 = m2. This is a fairly realistic\nassumption for many layered crystal superconductors, such as YBCuO and BiSCuO,\nwhere properties within a layer are isotropic. Second we take 1=\u000b to be small. In\nthe derivation of the isotropic time-dependent Ginzburg{Landau equations, from the\nBordeen{Cooper{Schrei\u000ber (BCS) theory, for the case of alloys with paramagnetic\nimpurities, given by Gor\u2019kov and Eliashburg [12] this parameter turns out to be \u000f\n2\n12 .\nGor\u2019kov and Kopnin [13] in their analysis of the motion of a vortex in these alloys\ntake this parameter to be o(\u000f2). In [6], the scaling 1\u000b = O(\u000f\n2) was used, and this was\nfound simply to modify the mobility coe\u000ecient of the vortices. In the anisotropic case\nthe extra complication of having 1\u000b = O(\u000f\n2) is great, and we consider only the simpler\nlimit in which 1\u000b = o(\u000f\n2). Hence we write\nN = \u000f2\u000en; where \u000e = o(1):(29)\nFar \feld. We denote the outer solution away from the vortex cores by the sub-\nscript o. Equation (24) implies fo = 1 +O(\u000f2). Equations (25){(27) give the leading\norder behavior of ~Qo, ~Ho, and \u0002o as\n~r^\n\u0010\nP\n\u0010\n~r^ ~Q(0)o\n\u0011\u0011\n+ ~Q(0)o = 0;(30)\n\u0002(0)o = \u2212 ~r \u0001 ~Q(0)o = 0;(31)\n~r^ ~r^\n\u0010\nP ~H(0)o\n\u0011\n+ ~H(0)o = 0:(32)\nEquation (30) implies that\n~Q(0)o = \u2212 ~r^\n\u0010\nP ~H(0)o\n\u0011\n:(33)\nInner region. We consider an inner region in the vicinity of one of the vortex\ncores. Let the vortex lie along the curve \u0393k, given by ~x = (~x; ~y; ~z) = ~q(~s; t). We\nde\fne a local coordinate system (~s; ~\u001a; ~\u0012; T ) by\n~x = ~q(~s; t) + ~\u001a cos ~\u0012~n(~s; t) + ~\u001a sin ~\u0012~b(~s; t);\nt = T;\nwhere ~s is arclength, ~n(~s; t) is the unit normal, and ~b(~s; t) is the unit binormal to the\ncurve \u0393k. We de\fne the inner coordinates by introducing the stretched variable ~R\ngiven by ~\u001a = \u000f ~R. The coordinate system so de\fned is not orthogonal away from the\nvortex line when the torsion of the vortex is nonzero.

We complete this part of the analysis by matching ~Q(1)i with ~Q\n(0)\no using\n(68) and (57), and following the matching principle of Van Dyke [17].

Let us now return to the\nphysical variables to see the e\u000bect that the anisotropy has on the motion.\nUnscaled coordinates. We start by noting that the choice of the x-axis is arbitrary\nprovided it remains in the plane of isotropy. Hence, we can choose a set of axes such\nthat the tangent to the vortex curve lies in the x\u2212 z plane at the point on its length\nx = q(s0; t), where q(s; t) gives the position of the vortex line. We may expand q(s; t)\nabout the point given by s = s0,\nq(s; t) = q(s0; t) + (s\u2212 s0)t(s0; t) + (s\u2212 s0)\n2\n2\nCn(s0; t) + \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001(71)\nSince t(s0; t), the unit tangent vector, lies in the x\u2212 z plane, it can be expressed as\nt(s0; t) = (sin\u000b; 0; cos\u000b) :(72)\nThe unit normal at this point n(s0; t) is orthogonal to the tangent and so without\nloss of generality can be written as\nn(s0; t) = (sin\u001e cos\u000b; cos\u001e;\u2212 sin\u001e sin\u000b) :(73)\nThe unit binormal vector is determined by the relation b = t ^ n and hence\nb(s0; t) = (\u2212 cos\u000b cos\u001e; sin\u001e; sin\u000b cos\u001e) :(74)\nAfter writing q(s0; t) = (a; b; c) we can express each component of q(s; t) as a Taylor\nseries about the point given by s0.

Homogenization of a system of closely packed vortices.

To close the model it is necessary to\nderive an expression for this velocity, which will again require the consideration of an\ninner region in the vicinity of each vortex. In fact, to be systematic, we should also\nconsider the intermediate region in which lengths are scaled with \u0010 and the vortices\nagain appear as discrete lines.\nIntermediate region.

When the vortex lies in\na plane at an angle ~\u0012 to the z-axis this may be rewritten in the form\n(~x cos ~\u0012 \u2212 ~z sin ~\u0012)2 + ~y = ~r20 \u2212 2t;\n602 S. CHAPMAN AND G.

In order to calculate the velocity of one of these vortices one must calculate\nthe magnetic \feld due to the other and then substitute this into the velocity law\nat the point of the \frst vortex (see (125)). In general it su\u000eces to consider the\n\feld due to a vortex line lying along the \u0016z-axis. Note that the \feld takes the form\nH = H1(\u0016x; \u0016y)e\u0016x + H2(\u0016x; \u0016y)e\u0016y + H3(\u0016x; \u0016y)e\u0016z and thus that the \frst two components\nmay be written in terms of a stream function\nH1 = \u2212@ \n@y\n; H2 =\n@ \n@x\n;\nwhere the bars have now been dropped.

We have considered the behavior of a system of vortices in a\nhigh-Tc superconductor described by anisotropic Ginzburg{Landau equations. We\nbegan by analyzing a system of well-separated vortices and were able to derive a law of\nmotion analogous to the local induction approximation, in which the vortex moves in\n606 S. CHAPMAN AND G. RICHARDSON\nthe normal direction with a speed proportional to its curvature, where the constant of\nproportionality depends upon the angle the tangent to the vortex line makes with the\nc-axis. We then considered a system of densely packed vortices and were able to derive\na mean-\feld model, in which the individual vortices are replaced by a vortex density.\nThese results generalized the recent work in [4] and [6] to anisotropic superconductors.\nNext we looked at a system of sparsely packed vortices with su\u000eciently small curvature\nsuch that their motion is principally externally driven, a particular important example\nof this scenario being a group of parallel rectilinear vortices. Finally we looked at\nexamples of the self-induced motion of a planar vortex loop and of the velocity \feld\ninduced by a rectilinear vortex at various angles to the axes of anisotropy. We found\nan exact solution to the law of motion given by the local induction approximation\ncorresponding to an elliptical vortex shrinking to a point in \fnite time. Numerical\nsolutions of initially circular vortices showed the vortex to become elongated, with the\nportions of the vortex closest to being aligned with the z-axis (the axis of principal\nanisotropy) moving more slowly. When we examined the velocity of repulsion of a\npair of rectilinear vortices aligned at an angle to the z-axis, we found that the e\u000bects\nof the anisotropy were felt most strongly when the vortices were perpendicular to\nthis axis. In this case the vortices repel most strongly if the line of centers is also\nperpendicular to the z-axis (so that they lie in the xy-plane) and only weakly if the\nline of centers is along the z-axis (so that the vortices lie in the xz-plane).\nREFERENCES\n[1] G.K.
