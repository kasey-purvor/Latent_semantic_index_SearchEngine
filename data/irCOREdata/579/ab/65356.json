In contrast to conventional\nfixed-to-mobile (F2M) cellular radio systems, in M2M systems\nboth the transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) are in motion\nand equipped with low elevation antennas. For M2M commu-\nnications, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology\nbecomes more attractive since multiple antenna elements can\nbe easily mounted on large vehicular surfaces. It is well-known\nthat the design of a wireless system requires the detailed\nknowledge about the underlying propagation channel and a\ncorresponding realistic channel model. Up to now, only few\nmeasurement campaigns had been conducted to investigate\nsingle-input single-output (SISO) M2M channels [4]\u2013[8], even\nfewer to study MIMO M2M channels [9].\nM2M channel models available in the literature can be cat-\negorized as deterministic models [10] and stochastic models,\nwhile the latter can be further classified as non-geometrical\nstochastic models (NGSMs) (also known as parametric mod-\nels) [6] and geometry-based stochastic models (GBSMs) [11]\u2013\n[14]. A deterministic M2M model based on the ray-tracing\nmethod was proposed in [10]. This model requires a detailed\nand time-consuming description of the propagation environ-\nment and consequently cannot be easily generalized to a wider\nclass of scenarios.\nA SISO NGSM proposed in [6] is the origin of the channel\nmodel standardized by IEEE 802.11p. This model determines\nphysical parameters of a M2M channel in a completely\nstochastic manner by prescribing underlying probability distri-\nbution functions (PDFs) without presuming any underlying ge-\nometry. Therefore, this model offers no conceptual framework\nto facilitate meaningful generalization into different scenarios.\nIn addition, this pure parameter-based model needs to jointly\nconsider many parameters for modeling MIMO channels,\nwhich leads to high complexity [15].\nA GBSM is derived from the predefined stochastic distribu-\ntions of effective scatterers by applying the fundamental laws\nof wave propagation. Such a model can be easily adapted to\ndifferent scenarios by changing the shape of the scattering\nregion (e.g., one-ring, two-ring, or ellipse). More importantly,\nthe application of the concept of effective scatterers signifi-\ncantly reduces the complexity of a GBSM since only single\nand\/or double scattering effects need to be simulated [15].\nMoreover, for modeling MIMO channels, a GBSM can avoid\nthe inherent complexity problem of a NGSM as shown in [15].\nIn [11] and [12], the first GBSM was proposed for isotropic\nSISO M2M Rayleigh fading channels and corresponding sta-\ntistical properties were investigated. In [13], a two-ring GBSM\nconsidering only double-bounced rays was presented for non-\n1536-1276\/09$25.00 c\u00a9 2009 IEEE\n2 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS, VOL. 8, NO. 9, SEPTEMBER 2009\nisotropic MIMO M2M Rayleigh fading channels in macro-cell\nscenarios. In [14], the authors proposed a general two-ring\nGBSM with both single- and double-bounced rays for non-\nisotropic MIMO M2M Ricean channels in both macro- and\nmicro-cell scenarios.\nNone of the above GBSMs is sufficiently general to char-\nacterize a wide variety of M2M scenarios, especially for pico-\ncell scenarios, which have recently been considered by some\nmeasurement campaigns [4]\u2013[9]. As demonstrated in [8], the\nimpact of the vehicular traffic density (VTD) on channel\ncharacteristics in micro- and pico-cell scenarios cannot be\nneglected, unlike in macro-cell scenarios. However, none\nof the existing GBSMs has the ability to take this impact\ninto account. Although the Doppler power spectral density\n(PSD) is one of the most important statistics that significantly\ndistinguish M2M channels from F2M channels, more detailed\ninvestigations of the Doppler PSD in non-isotropic scattering\nenvironments are surprisingly lacking in the open literature.\nMoreover, Doppler PSD characteristics for an ellipse M2M\nchannel model are not yet known. Finally, frequency cor-\nrelations of sub-channels with different carrier frequencies,\nstudied in [16] for F2M channels, in M2M communications\nhave not been studied so far, although orthogonal frequency-\ndivision multiplexing (OFDM) has already been suggested for\nuse in IEEE 802.11p.\nMotivated by the above gaps, in this paper we propose a new\nGBSM that addresses all the aforementioned shortcomings\nof the existing GBSMs. Based on the proposed model, the\nspace-time-frequency (STF) correlation function (CF) and\nthe corresponding space-Doppler-frequency (SDF) PSD are\nderived. The contributions and novelties of this paper are\nsummarized as follows.\n1) We propose a generic GBSM for narrowband non-\nisotropic MIMO M2M Ricean fading channels. The\nproposed model can be adapted to a wide variety of\nscenarios, e.g., macro-, micro-, and pico-cell scenarios,\nby adjusting model parameters.\n2) By distinguishing between the moving cars and the\nstationary roadside environments in micro- and pico-cell\nscenarios, our model is the first GBSM to consider the\nimpact of the VTD on M2M channel characteristics.\n3) We propose a new general method to derive the exact\nrelationship between the angle of arrival (AoA) and\nangle of departure (AoD) for any known shapes of the\nscattering region, e.g., one-ring, two-ring, or ellipse, in a\nwide variety of scenarios.\n4) We point out that the widely used CF definition in\n[13], [14], [17], [18] is incorrect and is actually the\ncomplex conjugate of the correct CF definition as given\nin Stochastic Processes [19].\n5) From the proposed model, we derive the STF CF and the\ncorresponding SDF PSD, which are sufficiently general\nand can be reduced to many existing CFs and PSDs,\nrespectively, e.g., those in [11], [13], [14], [17], [18].\nIn addition, our analysis shows that the space-Doppler\nPSD of a single-bounce two-ring model for non-isotropic\nMIMO M2M channels derived in [14] is incorrect.\n6) Based on the derived STF CF and SDF PSD, we study\nin more detail the degenerate CFs and PSDs in terms\nof some important parameters and thus obtain some\ninteresting observations. Finally, the obtained theoretical\nDoppler PSDs and measurement data in [6] are com-\npared. Excellent agreement between them demonstrates\nthe utility of the proposed model.\nThe remainder of this paper is outlined as follows. Section\nII describes the new adaptive GBSM for narrowband MIMO\nM2M Ricean fading channels. In Section III, based on the\nproposed new model, the STF CF and the corresponding SDF\nPSD are derived. Numerical results and analysis are presented\nin Section IV. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section V.\nII. A NEW ADAPTIVE GBSM FOR NON-ISOTROPIC MIMO\nM2M RICEAN FADING CHANNELS\nLet us now consider a narrowband single-user MIMO M2M\nmulticarrier communication system with MT transmit and MR\nreceive omnidirectional antenna elements. Both the Tx and Rx\nare equipped with low elevation antennas. Fig. 1 illustrates the\ngeometry of the proposed GBSM, which is the combination\nof a single- and double-bounce two-ring model, a single-\nbounce ellipse model, and the LoS component. As an example,\nuniform linear antenna arrays with MT = MR = 2 were\nused here. The two-ring model defines two rings of effective\nscatterers, one around the Tx and the other around the Rx.\nSuppose there are N1 effective scatterers around the Tx lying\non a ring of radius RT and the n1th (n1 = 1, ..., N1) effective\nscatterer is denoted by s(n1). Similarly, assume there are N2\neffective scatterers around the Rx lying on a ring of radius RR\nand the n2th (n2 = 1, ..., N2) effective scatterer is denoted\nby s(n2). For the ellipse model, N3 effective scatterers lie\non an ellipse with the Tx and Rx located at the foci. The\nsemi-major axis of the ellipse and the n3th (n3 = 1, ..., N3)\neffective scatterer are denoted by a and s(n3), respectively.\nThe distance between the Tx and Rx is D = 2f with f\ndenoting the half length of the distance between the two focal\npoints of the ellipse. The antenna element spacings at the\nTx and Rx are designated by \u03b4T and \u03b4R, respectively. It is\nnormally assumed that the radii RT and RR, and the difference\nbetween the semi-major axis a and the parameter f , are all\nmuch greater than the antenna element spacings \u03b4T and \u03b4R,\ni.e., min{RT , RR, a\u2212 f} \u0002 max{\u03b4T , \u03b4R}. The multi-element\nantenna tilt angles are denoted by \u03b2T and \u03b2R. The Tx and Rx\nmove with speeds \u03c5T and \u03c5R in directions determined by the\nangles of motion \u03b3T and \u03b3R, respectively. The AoA of the\nwave traveling from an effective scatterer s(ni) (i \u2208 {1, 2, 3})\ntoward the Rx is denoted by \u03c6(ni)R . The AoD of the wave\nthat impinges on the effective scatterer s(ni) is designated by\n\u03c6\n(ni)\nT . Note that \u03c6LoSRq denotes the AoA of a LoS path.\nThe MIMO fading channel can be described by a matrix\nH (t) = [hpq (t)]MR\u00d7MT of size MR \u00d7 MT . The received\ncomplex fading envelope between the pth (p = 1, ...,MT ) Tx\nand the qth (q = 1, ...,MR) Rx at the carrier frequency fc\nis a superposition of the LoS, single-, and double-bounced\ncomponents, and can be expressed as\nhpq (t) = hLoSpq (t) + h\nSB\npq (t) + h\nDB\npq (t) (1)\nwhere\nCHENG et al.: AN ADAPTIVE GEOMETRY-BASED STOCHASTIC MODEL FOR NON-ISOTROPIC MIMO MOBILE-TO-MOBILE CHANNELS 3\n1pn\n)( 2ns\n)( 1ns\nRT\n)( 3ns\npT\npT\nqR\nqR\n2pn\nqn1 qn2\n1n\n2n\n3pn\nqn3\n)( 3n\nT )( 3n\nR\n21nn\nfD 2\nTR RR\n1n\nT\n2n\nT\n3n\nT\n1n\nR\n2n\nR\n3n\nR R\nT\nR\nT\na2\nT\nR\nTO RO\nLoS\nRq\npq\nFig. 1.

(18)\nNote that the above derived expressions in (5)\u2013(18) are suffi-\nciently general and suitable for various scenarios. For macro-\nand micro-cell scenarios, the assumption D\u0002max{RT , RR},\nwhich is invalid for pico-cell scenarios, is fulfilled. Then, the\ngeneral expressions of \u03ben1 and \u03ben2 can further reduce to the\nwidely used approximate expressions as \u03ben1\u2248D\u2212RT cos\u03c6(n1)T\nand \u03ben2 \u2248 D+RR cos\u03c6(n2)R , respectively. In addition, the\ngeneral expressions (13)\u2013(16) for the two-ring model can\nfurther reduce to the widely used approximate expressions\nas \u03c6\n(n1)\nR \u2248 \u03c0\u2212\u0394T sin\u03c6(n1)T and \u03c6(n2)T \u2248 \u0394R sin\u03c6(n2)R with\n\u0394T\u2248RT \/D and \u0394R\u2248RR\/D. Moreover, the relationships (17)\nand (18) for the ellipse model obtained by using our method\nsignificantly simplify the relationships derived based on pure\nellipse properties, such as (A1)\u2013(A3) in [20] and (27), (28),\nand (32) in [21].\nSince the number of effective scatterers are assumed to be\ninfinite, i.e., Ni\u2192\u221e, the proposed model in (1) is actually a\nmathematical reference model and results in the Ricean PDF.\nDue to the infinite complexity, a reference model cannot be\nimplemented in practice. However, as mentioned in [22], a\nreference model can be used for theoretical analysis and design\nof a communication system, and also is a starting point to\ndesign a realizable simulation model that has the reasonable\ncomplexity, i.e., finite values of Ni. For our reference model,\nthe discrete expressions of the AoA, \u03c6(ni)R , and AoD, \u03c6\n(ni)\nT ,\ncan be replaced by the continuous expressions \u03c6(SBi)R and\n\u03c6\n(SBi)\nT , respectively. In the literature, many different dis-\ntributions have been proposed to characterize AoD \u03c6(SBi)T\nand AoA \u03c6(SBi)R , such as the uniform, Gaussian, wrapped\nGaussian, and cardioid PDFs [18]. In this paper, the von\nMises PDF [23] is used, which can approximate all the\naforementioned PDFs. The von Mises PDF is defined as\nf(\u03c6) \u0394= exp[k cos(\u03c6\u2212\u03bc)]\/[2\u03c0I0 (k)], where \u03c6 \u2208 [\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0), I0(\u00b7)\nis the zeroth-order modified Bessel function of the first kind,\n\u03bc\u2208[\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0) accounts for the mean value of the angle \u03c6, and\nk (k\u2265 0) is a real-valued parameter that controls the angle\nspread of the angle \u03c6.\nAs mentioned in the introduction, the proposed model\nin (1) is adaptable to a wide variety of M2M propagation\nenvironments by adjusting model parameters. It turns out\nthat these important model parameters are the energy-related\nparameters \u03b7SBi and \u03b7DB , and the Ricean factor Kpq . For\na macro-cell scenario, the Ricean factor Kpq and the energy\nparameter \u03b7SB3 related to the single-bounce ellipse model are\nvery small or even close to zero. The received signal power\nmainly comes from single- and double-bounced rays of the\ntwo-ring model, in which we assume that double-bounced rays\nbear more energy than single-bounced rays due to the large\ndistance D (larger distance D results in the independence of\nthe AoD and AoA), i.e., \u03b7DB>max{\u03b7SB1 , \u03b7SB2}\u0002\u03b7SB3 . This\nmeans that a macro-cell scenario can be well characterized\nby using a two-ring model with a negligible LoS component.\nIn contrast to macro-cell scenarios, in micro- and pico-cell\nscenarios, the VTD significantly affects the channel charac-\nteristics as presented in [8]. To consider the impact of the\nVTD on channel statistics, we need to distinguish between\nthe moving cars around the Tx and Rx and the stationary\nroadside environments (e.g., buildings, trees, parked cars, etc.).\nTherefore, we use a two-ring model to mimic the moving\ncars and an ellipse model to depict the stationary roadside\nenvironments. Note that ellipse models have been widely used\nto model F2M channels in micro- and pico-cell scenarios [20],\n[21]. However, to the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, this is\nthe first time that an ellipse model is used to mimic M2M\nchannels. For a low VTD, the value of Kpq is large since the\nLoS component can bear a significant amount of power. Also,\nthe received scattered power is mainly from waves reflected\nby the stationary roadside environments described by the\nscatterers located on the ellipse. The moving cars represented\nby the scatterers located on the two rings are sparse and\nthus more likely to be single-bounced, rather than double-\nbounced. This indicates that \u03b7SB3>max{\u03b7SB1 , \u03b7SB2}>\u03b7DB\nholds. For a high VTD, the value of Kpq is smaller than that\nin the low VTD scenario. Also, due to the large amount of\nmoving cars, the double-bounced rays of the two-ring model\nbear more energy than single-bounced rays of two-ring and\nellipse models, i.e, \u03b7DB>max{\u03b7SB1 , \u03b7SB2 , \u03b7SB3}. Therefore,\na micro-cell and pico-cell scenario with consideration of the\nVTD can be well characterized by utilizing a combined two-\nring model and ellipse model with a LoS component.\nIII. NEW GENERIC STF CF AND SDF PSD\nIn this section, based on the proposed channel model in (1),\nwe will derive the STF CF and the corresponding SDF PSD\nfor a non-isotropic scattering environment.\nA. New Generic STF CF\nUnder the wide sense stationary (WSS) condition, the nor-\nmalized STF CF between any two complex fading envelopes\nhpq (t) and h\u2032p\u2032q\u2032 (t) with different carrier frequencies fc and\nf \u2032c, respectively, is defined as [24]\n\u03c1hpqh\u2032p\u2032q\u2032(\u03c4, \u03c7)=\nE\n[\nhpq (t) h\u2032\u2217p\u2032q\u2032(t\u2212 \u03c4)\n]\n\u221a\n\u03a9pq\u03a9p\u2032q\u2032\n=\n\u03c1hLoSpq h\u2032LoSp\u2032q\u2032\n(\u03c4, \u03c7)+\nI\u2211\ni=1\n\u03c1\nh\nSBi\npq h\n\u2032SBi\np\u2032q\u2032\n(\u03c4, \u03c7)+\u03c1hDBpq h\u2032DBp\u2032q\u2032(\u03c4, \u03c7) (19)\nwhere (\u00b7)\u2217 denotes the complex conjugate operation, E [\u00b7] is\nthe statistical expectation operator, p, p\u2032 \u2208 {1, 2, ...,MT}, and\nq, q\u2032 \u2208 {1, 2, ...,MR}. It should be observed that (19) is a\nfunction of time separation \u03c4 , space separation \u03b4T and \u03b4R, and\nfrequency separation \u03c7 = f \u2032c\u2212 fc. Note that the CF definition\nin (19) is different from the following definition widely used\nin other references, e.g., [13], [14], [17], [18]\n\u03c1\u02dchpqh\u2032p\u2032q\u2032 (\u03c4, \u03c7)=E\n[\nhpq (t)h\u2032\u2217p\u2032q\u2032 (t + \u03c4)\n]\n\/\n\u221a\n\u03a9pq\u03a9p\u2032q\u2032 . (20)\nThe CF definition in (19) is actually the correct one following\nthe CF definition given in Stochastic Processes (see Equation\nCHENG et al.: AN ADAPTIVE GEOMETRY-BASED STOCHASTIC MODEL FOR NON-ISOTROPIC MIMO MOBILE-TO-MOBILE CHANNELS 5\n(9-51) in [19]). It can easily be shown that the expression\n(20) equals the complex conjugate of the correct CF in (19),\ni.e., \u03c1\u02dchpqh\u2032p\u2032q\u2032 (\u03c4, \u03c7) = \u03c1\n\u2217\nhpqh\u2032p\u2032q\u2032\n(\u03c4, \u03c7), and thus is an incorrect\ndefinition. Only when \u03c1\u2217hpqh\u2032p\u2032q\u2032 (\u03c4, \u03c7) is a real function (no\nimaginary part), \u03c1\u02dchpqh\u2032p\u2032q\u2032 (\u03c4, \u03c7) = \u03c1hpqh\u2032p\u2032q\u2032 (\u03c4, \u03c7) holds.\nSubstituting (2) and (5) into (19), we can obtain the STF\nCF of the LoS component as\n\u03c1hLoSpq hLoSp\u2032q\u2032\n(\u03c4)=\n\u221a\nKpqKp\u2032q\u2032\n(Kpq+1) (Kp\u2032q\u2032+1)\nej2\u03c0(G1+\u03c4H1+\n\u03c7\nc L1) (21)\nwhere G1 =P cos\u03b2T\u2212Q cos\u03b2R, H1 = fTmax cos \u03b3T\u2212fRmax\n\u00d7 cos\u03b3R, and L1=D\u2212kp\u2032\u03b4T cos\u03b2T+kq\u2032\u03b4R cos\u03b2R with P =\n(p\u2032\u2212p) \u03b4T \/\u03bb, Q = (q\u2032 \u2212 q) \u03b4R\/\u03bb, k\u2032p = (MT\u22122p\u2032+1) \/2, and\nk\u2032q=(MR\u22122q\u2032+1) \/2.\nApplying the von Mise PDF to the two-ring model, we\nobtain f(\u03c6SB1T ) = exp[kTRT cos(\u03c6\nSB1\nT \u2212\u03bcTRT )]\/[2\u03c0I0(kTRT )]\nfor the AoD \u03c6SB1T and f(\u03c6\nSB2\nR ) = exp[k\nTR\nR cos(\u03c6\nSB2\nR \u2212\u03bcTRR )]\n\/[2\u03c0I0(kTRR )] for the AoA \u03c6\nSB2\nR .

Consequently, the\nderived STF CF in (19) also includes other CFs listed in [14]\nas special cases, when \u03c4 is replaced by \u2212\u03c4 . If we consider\nthe one-ring model only around the Rx for a F2M channel in\na macro-cell scenario (\u03b7SB1 =\u03b7SB3 =\u03b7DB =fTmax =0) with\nnon-LoS (NLoS) condition (Kpq=0), the derived STF CF in\n(19) includes the CF (6) in [18] and, subsequently, other CFs\nlisted in [18] as special cases, when \u03c4 is replaced by \u2212\u03c4 .\nFurthermore, the CF (7) in [24] can be obtained from (19)\nwith Kpq =fTmax =\u03c7=\u03b7SB3 =\u03b7DB =0.

Due to the similar derivations of (29),\n(30), and (33), Appendix C only gives the brief outline of the\nderivation of (30), while others are omitted here.\nMany existing Doppler PSDs are special cases of the\nderived SDF PSD in (28). The simplest case is Clarke\u2019s\nDoppler PSD 1\/\n(\n2\u03c0fD\n\u221a\n1\u2212(fD\/fRmax)2\n)\n(|fD| \u2264 fRmax)\n[22], which can be obtained from (28) by setting Kpq = 0\n(NLoS condition), kTRR = 0 (isotropic scattering around the\nRx), \u03c7=0 (no frequency separation), fTmax =\u03b7SB1 =\u03b7SB3 =\n\u03b7DB=0 (fixed Tx, no scattering around the Tx), and applying\nD\u0002max{RT , RR} (macro- and micro-cell scenarios). The\nDoppler PSD for isotropic M2M fading channels presented as\n(41) in [11] can be obtained from (28) by setting Kpq=kTRT =\nkTRR = \u03b4T = \u03b4R = \u03c7 = \u03b7SB1 = \u03b7SB2 = \u03b7SB3 = 0 and using\nD \u0002 max{RT , RR}. Similarly, the space-Doppler PSD for\nnon-isotropic double-bounce two-ring model shown as (42)1\nin [14] can be obtained from (28) by setting Kpq=\u03c7=\u03b7SB1=\n\u03b7SB2=\u03b7SB3=0 and utilizing D\u0002max{RT , RR}, when DTRT\nand DTRR are replaced by \u2212DTRT and \u2212DTRR , respectively,\ndue to applying the different CF definitions.\nTo further demonstrate that the CF definition in (19) is\ncorrect, in Appendix D we compare the Doppler PSDs with\ndifferent CFs (19) and (20). Appendix D demonstrates that\n(19) leads to the Doppler PSD capable of capturing the under-\nlying physical phenomena of real channels for any scenarios,\nwhile the widely used expression (20) is only applicable to\ncertain scenarios where the Doppler PSD is a real function and\nsymmetrical to the origin (i.e., the corresponding CF is a real\nfunction), e.g., Clarke\u2019s scenario. In [13], [14], [17], [18], the\ncommonly used formula (20) was misapplied to non-isotropic\nF2M or M2M scenarios.\nIV. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND ANALYSIS\nIn this section, based on the derived STF CF and SDF PSD\nin Section III, the degenerate CFs and PSDs of MIMO M2M\nchannels are numerically analyzed in detail. In addition, the\nnormalized Doppler PSDs of the proposed model for different\nenvironments are given and some of them are compared with\nthe available measured data in [6]. The following parameters\nare used for our numerical analysis: fc =5.9 GHz, fTmax =\nfRmax=570 Hz, D=300 m, a=200 m, and RT=RR=40 m.\nFigs. 2 and 3 illustrate the space and frequency CFs of the\nsingle- and double-bounce two-ring model and single-bounce\nellipse model for different scenarios. It is obvious that both\nthe space and frequency CFs vary significantly for different\nscenarios (Scenario a and Scenario b). We also notice that\ndirections of motion (related to the values of \u03b3T and \u03b3R) have\nno impact on the space and frequency CFs.\nFig. 4 shows normalized Doppler PSDs for different sce-\nnarios (Scenario a and Scenario b).

More\nimportantly, we found that the impact of single-bounced rays\nfrom different rings (ring around the Tx or Rx) on the Doppler\nPSD are the same for M2M channels when the Tx and Rx\nmove in opposite directions, leading to the U -shaped Doppler\nPSD for the single-bounce two-ring model. When the Tx and\nRx move in the same direction, the impact of single-bounced\nrays from different rings on the Doppler PSD are different in\nterms of the range of Doppler frequencies, which results in\nthe double-U -shaped Doppler PSD for the single-bounce two-\nring model. Therefore, we can conclude that a more realistic\nM2M channel model should take into account the different\ncontributions from different rings. However, this has not been\nconsidered in all the existing M2M GBSMs, e.g., in [14]. It\nis worth mentioning that by setting one terminal fixed (i.e.,\nfTmax = 0), our M2M model can reduce to a F2M model. In\nthis case, we studied the Doppler PSD for the corresponding\nsingle- and double-bounce two-ring F2M models and single-\nbounce ellipse F2M model, and found that they have the\nsame U -shaped PSD. For brevity, the results regarding F2M\nchannels are omitted here. These observations indicates that\nthe impact of single- and double-bounced rays on the Doppler\nPSD are completely different for M2M channels (U -shaped\nand \u201crounded\u201d-shaped, respectively), while they are the same\nfor F2M channels (U -shaped).

Both the Tx\nand Rx were equipped with one omnidirectional antenna, i.e.,\nSISO case. Based on the measured scenarios in [6], we chose\nthe following environment-related parameters: kTRT = 6.6,\nkTRR = 8.3, k\nEL\nR = 5.5, \u03bc\nTR\nT = 12.8\n\u25e6\n, \u03bcTRR = 178.7\n\u25e6\n, and\n\u03bcELR = 131.6\n\u25e6 for Fig. 7 (a), and kTRT = 9.6, kTRR = 3.6,\nkELR =11.5, \u03bc\nTR\nT =21.7\n\u25e6\n, \u03bcTRR =147.8\n\u25e6\n, and \u03bcELR =171.6\u25e6\nfor Fig. 7 (b). Considering the constraints of the Ricean\nfactor and energy-related parameters for different propagation\nscenarios as mentioned in Section II, we choose the following\nparameters in order to fit the measured Doppler PSDs reported\nin [6] for the two scenarios with low VTD: 1) K = 2.186,\n\u03b7DB =0.005, \u03b7SB1 =0.252, \u03b7SB2 =0.262, and \u03b7SB3 =0.481\nfor Fig. 7 (a); 2) K = 3.786, \u03b7DB = 0.051, \u03b7SB1 = 0.335,\n\u03b7SB2=0.203, and \u03b7SB3=0.411 for Fig. 7 (b). The excellent\nagreement between the theoretical results and measured data\nconfirms the utility of the proposed model. The environment-\nrelated parameters for high VTD in Figs. 7 (a) and (b) are\nthe same as those for low VTD except kTRT = kTRR = 0.6,\nwhich are related to the distribution of moving cars (normally,\nthe smaller values the more distributed moving cars, i.e., the\nhigher VTD). The Doppler PSDs for high VTD shown in\nFigs. 7 (a) and (b) were obtained with the parameters K=0.2,\n\u03b7DB = 0.715, \u03b7SB1 = \u03b7SB2 = 0.115, and \u03b7SB3 = 0.055.\nUnfortunately, to the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, no\nmeasurement results (e.g., in [4]\u2013[9]) were available regarding\nthe impact of high VTD (e.g., a traffic jam) on the Doppler\nPSD.\nComparing the theoretical Doppler PSDs in Figs. 7 (a)\nand (b), we observe that the VTD significantly affects both\nthe shape and value of the Doppler PSD for M2M channels.\nThe Doppler PSD tends to be more evenly distributed across\nall Doppler frequencies with a higher VTD. This is because\nwith a high VTD, the received power mainly comes from the\nmoving cars around the Tx and Rx from all directions, while\nthe power of the line-of-sight (LoS) component is not that\nsignificant. This means that the received power for different\nDoppler frequencies (directions) is more evenly distributed.\nWith a low VTD, the received power from the LoS component\nmay be significant, while the power from the moving cars may\nbe small. Therefore, the power tends to be concentrated on\nsome Doppler frequencies.\nV. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have proposed a generic and adaptive\nGBSM for non-isotropic MIMO M2M Ricean fading channels.\nBy adjusting some model parameters and with the help of\nthe newly derived general relationship between the AoA and\nAoD, the proposed model is adaptable to a wide variety of\nM2M propagation environments. In addition, the VTD is for\nthe first time taken into account in the GBSM for modeling\nM2M channels. From this model, we have derived the STF CF\nand the corresponding SDF PSD for non-isotropic scattering\nenvironments, where the closed-form expressions are available\nin the case of the single-bounce two-ring model for macro-\ncell and micro-cell scenarios, and the double-bounce two-ring\nmodel for any scenarios. Based on the derived STF CFs and\nSDF PSDs, we have further investigated the degenerate CFs\nand PSDs in detail and found that some parameters (e.g., the\nangle spread, direction of motion, antenna element spacing,\netc.) and the VTD have a great impact on the resulting CFs and\nPSDs. It has also been demonstrated that for M2M isotropic\nscenarios, no matter what the direction of motion and shape\nof the scattering region are, single-bounced rays will result in\nthe U -shaped Doppler PSD, while double-bounced rays will\nresult in the \u201crounded\u201d-shaped Doppler PSD. Finally, it has\nbeen shown that theoretical Doppler PSDs match the measured\ndata in [6], validating the utility of our model.\nAPPENDIX\nA. DERIVATIONS OF (13)\u2013(18)\nIn this appendix, following the same derivation procedure\n(i.e., the same newly proposed method), we will derive these\ngeneral relationships for the two-ring model in (13)\u2013(16) and\nthe ellipse model in (17) and (18).

From\nthe above expressions, we can easily obtain (13) and (14).\nSimilarly, applying the laws of cosines and sines to the triangle\nOT s\n(n2)OR, we have \u03be2n2=R\n2\nR+D\n2+2DRR cos\u03c6\n(n2)\nR , R\n2\nR=\n\u03be2n2+D\n2\u22122D\u03ben2 cos\u03c6(n2)T , and RR\/ sin\u03c6(n2)T =\u03ben2\/ sin\u03c6(n2)R .\nWe can easily obtain (15) and (16) from these expressions.\nAnalogously, applying the laws of cosines and sines to the\ntriangle OT s(n3)OR, we get\n(\n\u03be\n(n3)\nT\n)2\n=\n(\n\u03be\n(n3)\nR\n)2\n+D2+2D\u03be(n3)R\n\u00d7 cos\u03c6(n3)R ,\n(\n\u03be\n(n3)\nR\n)2\n=\n(\n\u03be\n(n3)\nT\n)2\n+D2\u22122D\u03be(n3)T cos\u03c6(n3)T , and\n\u03be\n(n3)\nR \/ sin\u03c6\n(n3)\nT =\u03be\n(n3)\nT \/ sin\u03c6\n(n3)\nR .

COMPARISON BETWEEN THE DOPPLER PSDS WITH DIF-\nFERENT CFS (19) AND (20)\nTo further clarify which CF definition, (19) or (20), results\nin the correct Doppler PSD to accurately reflect the under-\nlying physical phenomena of real channels, we first derive\nthe relationship between the Doppler PSD based on the CF\n(19), Shpqhpq (fD), and the Doppler PSD based on the CF\n(20), S\u02dchpqhpq (fD). Considering the equality \u03c1\u02dchpqhpq (\u03c4) =\n\u03c1\u2217hpqhpq (\u03c4) and the Fourier transform relation between the CF\nand Doppler PSD, we have\nS\u02dchpqhpq (fD) = S\n\u2217\nhpqhpq (\u2212fD) . (37)\nFrom (37), it is clear that only if Shpqhpq (fD) is a real function\nand symmetrical to the origin, the equality S\u02dchpqhpq (fD) =\nShpqhpq (fD) holds. Note that due to the Fourier transform re-\nlationship, the equality S\u02dchpqhpq (fD) = Shpqhpq (fD) leads to\nthe equality \u03c1\u02dchpqhpq (\u03c4) = \u03c1hpqhpq (\u03c4) and vice versa. We now\nproceed the comparison of Shpqhpq (fD) and S\u02dchpqhpq (fD) in\nthe following two typical scenarios.\nRx (MS) Tx (MS1) Rx (MS2) \nScenario1 Scenario2\n3\n,\nTR\nR\nR\nk\n(a) (b)\nTx (BS) \nFig. 8. Graphical description of (a) Scenario1 and (b) Scenario2.\nThe first typical scenario, Scenario1, is a non-isotropic F2M\nmacro-cell propagation environment (fTmax=0), as shown in\nFig. 8(a). We use a one-ring model to represent this scenario,\nwhere the ring of scatterers is around the Rx, i.e., mobile\nstation (MS), and the MS moves toward the direction of the\nTx, i.e., \u03b3R = \u03c0. Note that the major amount of scatterers\nare located in a small part of the ring facing the motion of\nthe MS, i.e., \u03bcR =\u03c0. The second scenario, Scenario2, is an\nisotropic M2M propagation environment (kTRT = kTRR = 0),\nwhere the Tx and Rx move in opposite directions (\u03b3T=0 and\n\u03b3R =\u03c0), as shown in Fig. 8(b). Here, a single-bounce two-\nring model is used to represent this scenario. For Scenario1,\nbased on (37), the opposite results for the Doppler PSD\nare expected as shown in Fig. 9, where kTRR = 3. Since\nthe MS moves toward the majority of received signals, the\nmaximum Doppler PSD should appear at fD=fRmax=570 Hz.\nFrom Fig. 9, it is clear that the Shpqhpq (fD) presents the\nunderlying physical phenomena for Scenario1. For Scenario2,\nas expected from (37), the opposite results of the Doppler\nPSD with respect to the range of Doppler frequencies are\nillustrated in Fig. 9, where fTmax = fRmax = 570 Hz were\nused. Since the Tx and Rx are moving in opposite directions,\nthe Doppler PSD should be limited to the range of Doppler\nfrequencies 0\u2264fD\u22641140 Hz, whereas the maximum Doppler\nPSD exists at fD = 0 and fD = fTmax+fRmax = 1140 Hz.\nAgain, from Fig. 9, it is obvious that Shpqhpq (fD) reflects the\nunderlying physical phenomenon for Scenario2. Therefore, we\ncan conclude that Shpqhpq (fD) is able to accurately capture\nthe underlying physical phenomena of real channels for any\nscenarios, while S\u02dchpqhpq (fD) cannot. It is worth stressing that\nfor an isotropic F2M macro-cell scenario (Clarke\u2019s scenario),\nwhere no scatterers are around the Tx, we find that the\ndifference of the Doppler PSD caused by two CF definitions\nvanishes, i.e., S\u02dchpqhpq (fD) = Shpqhpq (fD). This is because\nClarke\u2019s scenario has the U -shape Doppler PSD, which is a\nreal function and symmetrical to the origin. This seems to be\nthe reason why the CF (20) was widely misapplied.\nREFERENCES\n[1] R. Wang and D. Cox, \u201cChannel modeling for ad hoc mobile wireless\nnetworks,\u201d in Proc.
