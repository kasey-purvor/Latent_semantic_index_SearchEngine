There are several important aspects of supplier management, they\ninclude sourcing strategies, the way relationships are management and the information exchange\npolicies adopted by manufacturers. Typically, it has been argued in the literature that close\nrelationships with suppliers should be developed, in contrast to the traditional price-driven\ntransactional relationship. In conjunction with this approach manufacturers should employ a single-\nsourcing strategy rather than multi-sourcing. This paper presents the results of a study (using a\nsurvey) of supplier management practices among German manufacturing companies. The research\nfound that significant portion of the companies surveyed had experienced a change in their\nrelationship with suppliers in the last few years. In the main relationships had become closer and\nthe use of partnerships was in evidence. Although the companies had developed partnerships with\nsome of their suppliers the majority of firms continued to prefer a multi-sourcing policy. The\nresearch results have implications for German manufacturing companies as they indicate the\npotential for improvement through the greater adoption of best practices in the area of supplier\nmanagement.\n2Introduction\nIn today\u2019s industrial environment, suppliers of components or assemblies can make a major\ncontribution to a manufacturer\u2019s performance in the areas of quality, delivery, cost containment and\nnew product development. Consequently, effective supplier management has become a critical issue\nfor operations managers and what has been called the \u2018traditional\u2019 approach to manufacturer-\nsupplier relationships \u2013 where the main focus is on price \u2013 can no longer deliver a competitive\nadvantage for anything other than commodity parts. Therefore, the way in which manufacturers deal\nwith their suppliers has transformed (Lamming, 1993). Nowadays, supplier management is\nconcerned with \u201corganising the optimal flow of high-quality, value-for-money materials or\ncomponents to manufacturing companies from a suitable set of innovative suppliers\u201d (Goffin et al.,\n1997: 422). The challenge for manufacturers is to identify how to manage their suppliers\nstrategically and effectively.\nA number of empirical studies in the UK have explored the importance of supplier management\nin manufacturing (see, for example, Goffin et al., 1997; and Groves & Valsamakis, 1998). In\ncontrast, it has been recognised that very little empirical research has been conducted in Germany\n(Homburg, 1995; Lemke et al., 2000; Lemke et al., 2003; and Szwejczewski et al., 2001). This is\nsomewhat surprising, because Germany has a substantial manufacturing sector that accounts for 25%\nof Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which employs an equally high proportion of the workforce and\nis a leading exporter of manufactured goods (Anonymous, 1999). In addition, the competitiveness of\nGerman manufacturing industry has been the subject of much foreign admiration in the past (e.g.,\nSimon, 1992; Porter, 1990), although high manufacturing costs have, in recent years, somewhat\neroded this reputation (Goffin et al., 2001). Due to both its size and strength, the manufacturing\nsector in Germany is a relevant business environment in which to study supplier management.\n3The importance of supplier management has been recognised by several German authors (see, for\nexample, Becker, 1997; and Nachtweh, 1999). Recently, Supply Chain Management (SCM) has\nbeen identified as the key challenge for German manufacturers. However, it has been found that\nleading-edge SCM practices and partnership approaches are not being adopted by German\ncompanies (Friedrich et al., 1995). In a similar vein, it has been reported that manufacturers in\nGermany have been slow to adopt lean production and other new manufacturing management\nconcepts (Kinkel and Wengel, 1997; Lay et al., 1996).\nThe small number of empirical investigations into supplier management in Germany means that\nmany SCM issues need to be investigated, such as:\n\uf0b7 How do German manufacturers characterise their relationships with suppliers \u2013 are they\nestablishing close relationships with them?\n\uf0b7 How have supplier-manufacturer relationships changed in recent years?\n\uf0b7 What are the preferred sourcing strategies of manufacturers?\n\uf0b7 How is information technology used to optimise communications?\nIn order to address these questions, an empirical investigation of supplier management in German\nmanufacturing companies was conducted by surveying three industrial sectors.\nThis paper is structured in the following way. First, it reviews the literature on the nature of\nbusiness relationships; the development of supplier-manufacturer relationships; as well as sourcing\nstrategies and the management of supplier relationships. Secondly, the conclusions from the\nliterature are used to determine three research questions, which were investigated using a telephone\nsurvey. Next, the findings of the study are contrasted with the literature and implications are drawn.\nFinally, the implications for both managers and researchers are discussed.\n4The nature of business relationships\nBusiness relationships have been defined very differently in the literature, ranging from \u201cgood\nbusiness relationships [are] relationships customised to fit the appropriate position on a continuum\nof possible relationship styles\u201d (Cooper and Gardner, 1993: 14) to \u201cinterorganizational relationships\nare the relatively enduring transactions, flows, and linkages that occur among or between an\norganization and one or more organizations in its environment\u201d (Oliver, 1990: 241). Researchers\nhave developed descriptions of many types of relationships. Gummesson (1997) defined thirty forms\nof relationship alone and this illustrates the diversity of viewpoints on the concept of relationships.\nTypically, the descriptions of relationships are relatively abstract and vary with the discipline from\nwhich they are being researched (e.g., strategy, economics or psychology). Nevertheless, a consensus\nof opinion seems to have been reached which indicates that a business relationship is established, as\nsoon as two or more parties (i.e., organisations) associate themselves in order to fulfil a mutual\nbusiness purpose. Such an association leads to various joint activities, which are dependent on the\nspecific business objective. A key business relationship, in which two parties associate, is that\nbetween a manufacturer and a supplier (Ellram, 1991).\nIn the past, the objectives of manufacturer supplier relationships have been focused on quality\nenhancements, delivery on time, and especially, cost reduction (Lamming, 1993; Lemke et al.,\n2003). The historical focus on costs in supplier management is explained by the goal of profit\nmaximisation. Drucker (1995: 122) concurred that this traditional mindset \u201chas always somehow\nperceived business as buying cheap and selling dear. The new approach defines a business as the\norganisation that adds value and creates wealth.\u201d\n5In the current business environment, that manufacturers face, relationships should not be\nconcerned simply with maximising the difference between purchasing costs and the sales price \u2013\nthere needs to be the development of lasting relationship (Anderson and Katz, 1998; Kim, 1999).\nThe change of emphasis from reducing costs to improving quality and utilising the innovative\npotential of the supplier to create value has influenced relationships with suppliers. Leenders and\nFearon (1997: 282) highlighted this in saying that \u201cthe whole art of supplier relationship\nmanagement from a supply perspective is to bring both sides into an effective working relationship.\u201d\nThe exact nature of the relationship has changed over the decades, the next section examines the\ndevelopment that has taken place.\nThe development of supplier-manufacturer relationships\nMcGinnis and McCarty (1998: 13) argued that \u201cin an effort to optimise buying externally,\ncompanies are instituting sophisticated new buying processes and changing the relationships they\nhave with their suppliers\u201d Figure 1 illustrates the development in the nature of typical manufacturer-\nsupplier relationships over the last 40 years.\nTake in Figure 1\nTraditional relationships in the 1960s and \u201970s were characterised by an adversarial arm\u2019s-\nlength approach. Lamming (1993: 149) surveyed supplier-manufacturer relationships in the UK\nautomotive industry and identified that at this time there was \u201ca period of relative calm with\ndomestic demand and supply well balanced for mass producers.\u201d This suited traditional purchasing,\nwhich is primarily price-oriented. The pressure for change was low, but increased in the next decade\n6so that logistic relationships were adopted. These added an emphasis on making the materials\ntransfer from suppliers to manufacturers more efficient (da Villa and Panizzolo, 1996). At the\nbeginning of the \u201990s, relationships required an even greater degree of interaction due to the added\nneed for product innovation and cooperation in technological developments \u2013 and this high level of\ninteraction is termed partnership (Lamming, 1993). Unfortunately, it is unclear how exactly\npartnerships differ from other forms of relationship. Lemke et al.\u2019s (2003) study of the attributes of\npartnerships was a rare empirical investigation of this area. As it was based on a limited sample,\nhowever, the findings cannot be generalised. Similarly, it is unclear how the typical forms of\nsupplier-manufacturer relationship will develop in the 2000s (as indicated in Figure 1).\nFrom a theoretical point of view, the difference between, traditional arm\u2019s-length relationships\nand partnerships is clear \u2013 partnerships are closer than other types of relationship (e.g., Ellram, 1991;\nLambert et al., 1996; Lemke et al., 2003; Macbeth, 1998). In practice, however, the differentiation\nbetween types of relationships is not straightforward. This is because of the abstract nature of most\ndefinitions of relationships makes them difficult to operationalise. For instance, when exploring\nsupplier-manufacturer relationships in the US automotive industry, Dyer et al. (1998: 59) discovered\nthat \u201cU.S. automakers\u2019 relationships with \u2018partners\u2019 were not significantly different from their\nrelationships with \u2018arm\u2019s-length\u2019 suppliers.\u201d The authors attributed this to the history of how\nsuppliers have been managed. In America, suppliers had traditionally been dealt with at arm\u2019s-length\nand it is reported that this is still a common approach today, even in so-called partnerships. Another\nconclusion, however, might be that researchers have not yet identified the critical dimensions of\npartnerships. In addition, there is the strong possibility that managers\u2019 understandings of partnership\nare different from those of researchers. Support for this view comes from New and Payne\u2019s (1995)\nexploratory work, which indicated a great diversity of interpretations of partnership among\nmanagers. Therefore, it can be deduced that partnership is currently an equivocal concept and\n7exploring supplier-manufacturer relationships from the manager\u2019s perspective is both timely and\nrelevant.\nSourcing Strategies and Options\nIt is unlikely that it is desirable to establish partnerships with all suppliers. For example, partnerships\nare unnecessary with suppliers of commodities. Therefore, sourcing policies are closely allied with\nthe type of relationships a manufacturer intends to establish and partnership typically stands for \u2018one\nsupplier per part\/component\u2019 (single-sourcing strategy), according to Groves and Valsamakis (1998).\nConversely, when suppliers are managed at arm\u2019s-length, the multi-sourcing strategy (i.e., several\nsuppliers per part\/component) appears more suitable. In this case, quickly changing from one\nsupplier to another is easier, as a close relationship has not been developed.\nTake in Figure 2\nThere are a number of possible sourcing options, as illustrated by Figure 2. Between the single-\nsourcing and multi-sourcing strategies is the \u2018single-active\u2019 variation. This consists of one active\npartner and one inactive back-up supplier. Additionally, there is a \u2018dual-sourcing\u2019 strategy (with two\nactive suppliers). There are numerous options between dual- and multi-sourcing for example, any\nstrategy involving more than two suppliers per part\/component as shown by the dotted line in Figure\n2. Typically, a manufacturer will have a mix of options in its sourcing strategy. For example, critical\ncomponents may be sourced using a dual option, and commodity parts from multiple sources.\nEach sourcing option has distinct advantages and disadvantages (Godefroid, 2003; Slack et al.,\n1998). In the past, for instance, the safest approach was to focus on multiple sourcing, avoiding the\n8potential dependency on a small number of suppliers. This was most beneficial when the focus was\non price alone (Green and Nordstrom, 1974; Ramsay, 1996). Today, however, the majority of\nresearchers and practitioners advocate investing time and resources in maintaining relationships,\nrather than choosing new suppliers time and time again (Peck et al., 1999; Preiss et al., 1996). This\nshift in emphasis renders the sourcing options on the left-hand side of Figure 2 advantageous and\nconversely, multi-sourcing appears outdated in many business situations. Christopher (1998: 32-33)\nhighlights the fact that \u201cin many industries the practice of \u2018single sourcing\u2019 is widespread, .\u2026 More\nand more companies are discovering the advantages that can be gained by seeking mutually\nbeneficial, long-term relationships with suppliers.\u201d This observation accords with the development\nof partnership relations in the \u201990s as portrayed in Figure 1.\nLarson and Kulchitsky\u2019s (1998) empirical work in the US lends support to Christopher\u2019s\nobservation, as their survey and exploratory case study established significant links between single-\nsourcing, higher supplier product quality and lower total costs. In addition, Kalwani and\nNarayandas (1995) demonstrated that suppliers in long-term relationships achieved a higher\nprofitability compared to other transactional oriented firms in the USA. Long-term relationships\nhave thus the potential to benefit both business partners.\nEmpirical evidence on manufacturing companies\u2019 sourcing strategies is relatively sparse and so,\nfurther empirical investigations are required. The tendency towards single-sourcing strategies\nimplies the development of supplier-manufacturer partnerships, but the question is: how can they\nbest be managed?\n9The Management of Supplier Relationships\nSupplier management is no longer focused on just transactions and price negotiations, but\nconcentrates on a wider range of issues (Jahnukainen and Lahti, 1999). Today, the aim of supplier\nmanagement is to achieve an optimal flow of high-quality, value-for-money materials and\/or\ncomponents from innovative suppliers (Goffin et al., 1997). In this situation, the new role of the\npurchasing manager has been described as an \u2018information exchange broker\u2019 (Spekman et al., 1998)\nand Figure 3 illustrates the vastly increased information flows between a manufacturing company\nand its supplier base.\nTake in Figure 3\nPurchasing is located at the supplier-manufacturer interface and deals with the co-ordination of the\nflow of information between the supplier base (external links) and various departments (internal\nlinks). An effective supplier base can be used to enhance a manufacturer\u2019s capabilities. For example,\nthrough building on a supplier\u2019s expertise in technology and new product development. Stump and\nSriram (1997) found in their study of US manufacturing and service organisations that greater\ninvestment in IT played a role in changing the nature of relationships \u2014 investment in IT helped to\ndevelop closer relationships with suppliers. Consequently, one would expect the increase in external\nelectronic information links to enable partnerships to flourish. In this environment, the purchasing\nmanager provides other functions within the manufacturing company with relevant data for their\ndecision-making, including:\n10\n\u2022 Suppliers\u2019 capacity and production rates;\n\u2022 Logistics data;\n\u2022 Pricing and discounts;\n\u2022 New-product information.\nCo-operation on new product development (NPD) projects is a critical element of supplier\nmanagement today (Liker et al., 1996; Ragatz et al., 1997; Weken et al., 1997;). Recently, a German\nDelphi-Panel of experts forecast that suppliers will become responsible for major parts of research\nand development (R&D), as manufacturers focus on their core competencies (Cuhls et al., 1998).\nAn appropriate information system is required to manage information flow from and to suppliers,\nespecially for NPD (see, e.g., Spur, 1997). The implementation of Siemens\u2019 SMART (Strategic\nMaterial Acquisition Roadmap Technique) programme is a good example of this as it encourages\nsuppliers to submit ideas in a systematic way (Schwalbe, 1998). Overall, the content of information\nflow between suppliers and manufacturers and the communications process itself are under-\nresearched areas.\nSupplier categorisation\nThe use of a portfolio approach has been recommended in classifying suppliers and thereby assisting\nin the supplier management (Olsen & Ellram, 1997). In the portfolio approach, close relationships\nare developed with the suppliers of critical parts or components, whereas transactional relationships\nsuffice with commodity suppliers. The method is considered to be helpful in suggesting how to deal\nwith different suppliers and can be a useful input for supplier management decision-making. The\n11\nmore traditional method for categorising suppliers is the ABC approach (Backhaus, 1992). This\napproach can be used to help guide how the suppliers should be managed, for example the A-\nsuppliers should be treated differently to the C-suppliers (Hessenberger, 1991). Although, the\nmethod is recommended by some writers (for example, Hessenberger, 1991) it is not clear the degree\nto which German manufacturing companies use this method or the newer portfolio approach.\nConclusions from the literature\nThe nature of supplier-manufacturer relationships are changing from arm\u2019s-length relationships to\nclose partnerships. This change suggests that single or dual sourcing will be more common. With\ncloser contacts to suppliers, the literature also indicates that the information exchange will be\nincreased. Despite the developing nature of supplier-manufacturer relationships, it is apparent that\nthere has been relatively little empirical research on supplier management in Germany. From the\nliterature three research questions were derived:\nRQ 1. How common are partnerships in German industry?\n- How do managers characterise relationships?\n- What proportion of the supplier base is partnerships?\nRQ 2. What are the most commonly used sourcing strategies in German manufacturing industry?\nRQ 3. What information is typically exchanged between suppliers and manufacturers, particularly\nwith regard to NPD?\n12\nResearch design\nIn order to investigate the three research questions a telephone survey was selected as the most\neffective methodology. One possible approach to the research would have been to conduct a postal\nsurvey. However, the exploratory nature of the research meant that this technique was not\nappropriate (Alreck and Settle, 1985). The telephone interview allows the interviewer to probe in\nmore detail into an answer that is given, to gain clarity and greater insight.\nResearch instrument\nThe survey instrument was based on the one developed by Goffin et al. (1997) for a previous\ninvestigation of supplier management. A native speaker (one of the researchers) translated the\nquestionnaire into German. The instrument was then checked \u2014 that it was easy to understand and\nrelevant \u2014 by an independent German expert in the supplier management field. Five pilot interviews\nwere conducted in order to check the effectiveness of the questionnaire (one face-to-face interview,\nfollowed by four telephone interviews). The pilot interviews helped to affirm that the interview\nstructure, the individual questions, as well as the overall flow were relevant and applicable to\nGerman manufacturers.\nSample and interview details\nThe study used the International Best Factory Awards Deutschland (IBFA-D) database, which was\nlaunched in 1996 in Germany by Cranfield School of Management (UK) and the Export-Adademie\nBaden-W\u00fcrttemberg. The German database contains detailed information from several hundred\norganisations from various sectors of German industry, and it is used for benchmarking and research\npurposes. For detailed information about the IBFA programme, refer to New et al, 1998. Each\n13\nmanufacturing plant in the database has completed a detailed 16-page, confidential questionnaire\ncovering descriptive data (e.g., cost structure), performance data (e.g., delivery reliability), the\nproducts manufactured as well as management policies (e.g., market positioning). The IBFA-D\ndatabase also includes data on organisations\u2019 supplier management policies. This made it possible\nto triangulate respondents\u2019 comments made during the telephone interviews with some of the\ninformation in the database relating to supplier management (the answers given during the telephone\ninterviews were found to be consistent with the information provided in the questionnaire).\nThree sectors of German industry were selected from the IBFA-D database in which to examine\nthe issues of supplier management: engineering (including automotive), process, and electronics.\nThe three were chosen because they were the key German manufacturing sectors (New et al, 1998),\nand this selection yielded a population of 110 organisations from the database.\nBased on the exploratory nature of the research, the authors decided to conduct interviews with a\nrepresentative sample of the database population. For this purpose, a stratified random sample from\nthe 110 German organisations was created \u2013 50 companies were selected to be contacted. This\nnumber was deemed sufficient for an exploratory investigation. The sample breakdown by industry\nis shown in Table I.\nTake in Table I\nInitially, the organisations selected were sent a letter explaining the research project. Our \u2018first\ncontact\u2019 (as listed in the database; usually the Managing Director\/Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrer) was asked to pass\nthe letter on to the most appropriate manager dealing with the management of suppliers (normally\nthe purchasing manager). Thereby ensuring that interviews were carried out with the person with a\ngood understanding of how the company manages its suppliers. On the back of the letter was a pre-\n14\nprinted form for the manager responsible for suppliers to complete with his\/her name and contact\ndetails. In addition to the first letter, a follow-up letter was sent three weeks later. After further two\nweeks, one of the researchers (a native speaker) contacted the organisations that had not responded.\nIn this final contact phase, the MD was called directly and asked if their organisation would be\nwilling to co-operate. Utilising this intensive approach meant that 34 organisations agreed to\nparticipate in the research (a 68% response rate). As an incentive to all participating companies,\nrespondents were offered the results of the study in return for their support. All the respondents were\npromised confidentiality \u2014 individuals\u2019 and companies\u2019 names would not be revealed.\nBefore each interview, it was vital to ensure that the interviewee was the key informant for the\ncurrent research purposes. As Campbell (1955) noted, knowledgeable individuals generate the\nhighest quality data when answering questionnaires within their area of expertise. Therefore, the\ninterviews were held mostly with senior purchasing managers (see Table II).\nTake in Table II\nOne researcher conducted all 34 telephone interviews in his native language in order to avoid\npossible errors resulting from multiple interviewers. Since the interviews were exploratory in nature,\nrecording the conversation on tape is beneficial (Oppenheim, 1992) and so respondents\u2019 consent was\nsought. In 32 cases the respondent agreed to a recording. In addition, notes were taken during the\ninterview process (and where recording was not allowed, this formed the data collection method).\nThe interviews took 30 minutes on average and discussed in-depth each company\u2019s approach to\nsupplier management.\n15\nResults and discussion\nThis section presents the results of the investigation of supplier-manufacturer relationships, moves\non to sourcing strategies and concludes with the types of information that typically is exchanged\nbetween manufacturers and their suppliers, including NPD.\nSupplier-manufacturer relationships\nIn the first part of the investigation, the respondents were asked to characterise their relationships\nwith suppliers. The thirty-four managers described the relationship to their suppliers in thirteen ways\nand Table III summarises the answers given, as well as the frequency count.\nTake in Table III\nThe table highlights that fourteen managers characterised the relationship with their suppliers as\n\u201cgood\u201d and nine described it directly as \u201cpartnership-like\u201d (i.e., about a quarter of the respondents,\nhighlighted in grey). The remaining eleven interviewees, however, did not use either expression but\nmentioned one or more other characteristics. This explains why the sum of responses (n = 49; i.e., 14\ntangible + 35 intangible factors) is higher than the total number of respondents (n = 34). They\ndescribed the relationships, for instance, as \u2018goal directed or profit focus\u2019 or \u2018climate of trust.\u2019 The\nresearcher probed deeper into each relationship characteristic in order to gain a fuller understanding.\nInterestingly, only three factors could be backed up by tangible measures: for example \u2018co-operative\u2019\nwas explained as having regular supplier meetings for problem solving and improving results, while;\n\u2018goal directed \/ profit focus\u2019 meant that goals had been officially established between both parties;\nand \u2018long-term perspective\u2019 sealed by a long-term contract between the supplier and the\n16\nmanufacturer. The remaining characteristics, such as \u2018understanding \/ helpful,\u2019 were explained with\nphrases like \u201cIt is my feeling that\u2026\u201d \u201cMy experience tells me that\u2026\u201d or \u201cIn my point of view\u2026\u201d In\nshort, these characteristics are intangible and are therefore should be differentiated from the more\ntangible ones in Table III.\nIt is worth noting that every respondent had some difficulties expressing the views on supplier-\nmanufacturer relationships; many were even surprised have being asked the question directly. This\nmight indicate that practitioners do not often discuss the real nature of supplier-manufacturer\nrelationships. The answers offered illustrate that a diversity of perspectives on relationships exists.\nThe marketing literature indicates that relationships are driven by deeply held personal perceptions\nbut unfortunately, the telephone interview format did not allow the researchers to explore this issue\nfurther. Therefore, the drivers and real meaning of \u2018partnership\u2019 is an area that warrants further\nempirical attention.\nProportion of partnerships\nManagers perceived that their organisations had a given proportion of partnerships of their total\nsupplier base \u2013 see Table IV. This illustrates the proportions of partnerships ranges from 1% to the\ncomplete supply base, i.e., 100%.\nTake in Table IV\nHowever, interpreting the results is difficult, as the perception of what a partnership constitutes is\nobviously not the same among the manufacturers. This again points to the need for more research on\nthe meaning of partnerships. Only a few respondents (i.e., 6) claimed to have a partnership\n17\nproportion of more than 50% in their supply bases (highlighted in grey). The majority perceive\nthemselves as having a substantially smaller number of partnerships. The nature of the manufacturer\nsupplier relationships also has changed over time and needs to be considered (refer to Table V).\nTake in Table V\nTrends in relationships\nTable V shows that 50% of managers (n = 17) perceived to have a closer relationship with their\nsuppliers today compared to 3 or 5 years ago (highlighted in grey). In the answers, the term \u2018close\u2019\nappears to be often used synonymously with \u2018partnership\u2019. By contrast, five respondents perceived\nthe relationship to be more distant today, compared to the past. Interestingly, nine respondents did\nnot experience any changes in their supplier relationships within the same period. Their answers\nprompted the question of whether the relationships were perceived to be partnerships already and did\nnot need to be changed as a result of this. It turned out that six, out of nine managers, described their\nsupplier relationships as being \u2018(very) close\u2019 which is an indication that a partnership had already\nbeen established some 3 or 5 years prior to our investigation.\nSupplier categorisation\nThe research also looked at how suppliers are categorised. Although intangible supplier\ncharacteristics play a vital role in relationships (as highlighted in Table III), New and Burnes (1998)\nhad the notion that the majority of companies tend to categorise suppliers in terms of\nproduct\/services they offer rather than their capabilities. This means that the supplier\u2019s past and\npresent levels of quality are of greater interest to manufacturers than, for instance, their expected\n18\ncapability to innovate. The present research has shown that all but three managers use a\ncategorisation scheme based on ABC-analysis (see Table VI).\nTake in Table VI\nOf the thirty-one manufacturers who categorise their suppliers, twenty-seven take \u2018volume\u2019 as the\ncriteria. This approach is followed by \u2018quality\u2019 and \u2018delivery.\u2019 These three categories clearly\ndominate the ABC evaluation scheme and are often applied in combination. Other ways of grouping\nsuppliers were mentioned somewhat infrequently, as for instance, ABC analysis in terms of\n\u2018packaging.\u2019 Categories like these are not included in the table, as only single respondents mentioned\nthem.\nSourcing strategies\nRespondents were asked to identify what their organisation\u2019s \u2018predominant sourcing strategy\u2019 was\n(refer to Table VII).\nTake in Table VII\nSeventeen managers claimed to predominantly apply the multi-sourcing strategy. This means that in\nsome instances a \u2018multi-sourcing manufacturer\u2019 might be forced to purchase a specific component\nfrom a single supplier, because there is no alternative available. However, as his policy is\npredominantly multi-sourcing, his goal is to continuously search for other options \u2013 single-sourcing\nis not the preferred solution. Half of the respondents claimed to have a multi-sourcing policy in\n19\nplace, while less than half (41%) apply the dual-sourcing strategy. Only three manufacturers had a\ngenuine single-sourcing policy. The relative low number of companies choosing single sourcing\ncould indicate that true partnerships are rare.\nInformation exchange and NPD\nIt was of interest to determine the forms of information exchange that are now commonly used (see\nTable VIII). Over 70% of the manufacturers had email contact with their suppliers. Due to the small\nsize of some suppliers, six of the twenty-four respondents who claimed to utilise the email system,\nclarified that they only did so infrequently. This leaves eighteen (53%) of the companies surveyed\nwho have regular email contact with their suppliers.\nTake in Table VIII\nThe research also explored the content of the information flow between manufacturers and\nsuppliers (see Table IX). The table illustrates that the majority of the information types identified (81\n= 72%) passing between suppliers and manufacturers is related to order details (e.g., delivery, price,\nand quality; highlighted in grey) and to a much lesser extent (17 = 15%) with technical specifications\n(e.g., technical drawings, design sketches). A small proportion of the information exchanged (14 =\n13%) is associated with the strategic side (e.g., new business directions, changes in product and\nprocess designs).\nTake in Table IX\n20\nAs information exchange is predominantly driven by specific orders, the researchers were interested\nin finding out whether the information provided by the suppliers is suitable for improving\nmanufacturers\u2019 NPD processes. Of the thirty-four respondents, twenty-nine (85%) claimed to use the\ninformation in their NPD processes while five (15%) admitted to find the information provided by\nsuppliers to be unsuitable for this purpose.\nIn the interviews, manufacturers stated that information is commonly exchanged in meetings with\nsuppliers, and in the exchange of engineers. Table X shows their answers.\nTake in Table X\nTypically, the flow of information between suppliers and manufacturers is optimised when they\nexchange engineers on a temporary basis. This is especially important in NPD. The majority (82%)\nstated that they use this practice, but only when they are experiencing problems at the manufacturing\nsite and solutions are needed quickly to keep the production process going. In turn, this means that\nthe exchange of engineers does not take place when production processes run trouble-free.\nSomewhat surprising, no engineers were exchanged to enhance NPD possibly indicating that\nGerman industry is not yet taking advantage of the guest engineer concept. Approximately every\nfifth respondent did not exchange engineers at all, no matter of the nature of the problem at hand.\nOne of the reasons for avoiding exchanges was given by an MD in the engineering sector who said\n\u201cour industry sector is characterised by know-how. Exchanging engineers would put this know-how\nat risk, as it could unconsciously be transferred to competitors.\u201d\nSimilar findings were made with regard to meetings with suppliers. Here, the majority (65%)\nprefer meetings with the supplier in order to establish a personal contact. However, meetings only\n21\ntake place in \u2018problem cases\u2019 or when \u2018something of importance\u2019 needs to be discussed \u2013 a regular\nmeeting-cycle is not agreed on. The researchers did not expect to find that 35% of the respondents\ndo not utilise any meetings with suppliers to discuss NPD. A manager for central purchasing in the\nelectronics industry highlighted in this respect that \u201cwe do not have any meetings with suppliers, but\nI am trying to organise these. I have to admit that there is an opinion in some areas of our company,\nwhich says \u2018this component has not been invented here, so it cannot be any good.\u2019 This view needs\nto change before we can come together with our suppliers.\u201d\nSummary and conclusions\nThe literature on supplier management shows that supplier-manufacturer relationships have evolved\nand a partnership approach is now preferable, particularly for components where suppliers can help\nin the development of innovative designs. Partnerships are characterised by closer contacts and is\nsometimes embedded in manufacturers\u2019 single-sourcing strategies. A long-term perspective is a\nprerequisite for a higher degree of integration among partners and greater level of information\nexchange. Purchasing managers became information brokers as they form the interface between the\nmanufacturers\u2019 site and their supplier base.\nSurprisingly little empirical research has been conducted. Hence, this study:\n\uf0b7 Explored supplier-manufacturer relationships;\n\uf0b7 Determined sourcing-strategies; and\n\uf0b7 Investigated the nature of information exchanges between suppliers and manufacturers.\n22\nKey findings\nThe findings show that half of the German manufacturers surveyed experienced changes in their\nrelationships with suppliers in the last 3 to 5 years. In the main, relationships have become closer\nand \u2018partnership-like.\u2019 Nevertheless, managers hold different views on supplier relationships and\nthis study was able to lay open the range of perspectives. This probably reflects the wide diversity of\nrelationships that exist in supplier bases. Some respondents described 1% of their supply base as\npartners; others saw 100% of the base as partners. This huge difference makes it difficult to draw\nconclusions other than a) partnerships are different to normal relationships, and b) managers are\nclearly able to distinguish relationship types. However, the need for further empirical investigation is\nclear, as is the need to recognise that the term \u2018partnership\u2019 is both overused and somewhat\nequivocal.\nAs partnerships are evidently different from other types of supplier relationships, one would\nexpect to find additional factors used when evaluating partners. The present investigation has shown\nthat this is not the case. German manufactures commonly classify their suppliers in terms of\n\u2018volume,\u2019 \u2018quality\u2019 and \u2018delivery,\u2019 no matter what type of supplier relationship is perceived to be.\nThis approach goes against the long-term view associated with partnerships. Indeed, identifying and\nmonitoring the performance of companies in the supplier base merely using three factors is\ninsufficient. This suggests that the categorisation scheme of the companies surveyed is outdated\n(New and Burnes, 1998).\nWith regard to the sourcing strategy, 50% of manufacturers stated that they predominantly use a\nmulti-sourcing policy, while 41% adopted the dual-sourcing approach. Only 9% of respondents have\na genuine single-sourcing strategy in place. The result would suggest that only a small percentage of\nmanufacturers apply the full partnership approach. Yet, about 67% of respondents believed they\nwere in partnership with their suppliers. Taking the high percentage of multi-sourcing into account,\n23\none is led to believe that practitioners use the partnership-term lightly \u2013 a multi-sourcing partnership\nis somewhat a contradiction in terms. Yet, it appears that the German managers interviewed do not\nperceive a problem with combining multi-sourcing with partnership. This point requires further\ninvestigation.\nDue to the high percentage of manufacturers who claimed to see their suppliers as partners, one\nwould expect to find regular meetings as well as an exchange of engineers as typical ways of sharing\ninformation. Contrarily, meetings and exchanges of engineers are taking place infrequently -\nparticularly depending on whether problems occurred in the production process. About 20 per cent\nof the company did not exchange engineers with their suppliers at all; about a third did not have any\nmeetings with suppliers. Again, these results contradict the common understanding of how\npartnerships should be managed as advocated by the literature.\nAs soon as purchasing transactions are facilitated by IT, supplier-manufacturer relationships\nbecome closer (Stump and Sriram, 1997). The present study revealed that only 53% of\nmanufacturers keep in permanent email contact with their supply base. Typically, communication\nand placing orders takes place in a conventional way (i.e., telephone, fax, letter). The information\ncontent, which is normally shared, is concerned with details of the actual order (i.e., price, quantity).\nMerely 13% of the information flows carries strategic issues, such as suppliers\u2019 suggestions, product\ndesign changes and new business directions. So, only a very limited proportion of information is\nactually applicable to NPD processes. However, 85% of the respondents claimed to use the\ninformation generally exchanged with their suppliers for NPD purposes.\n24\nImplications for research\nThis study has implications for future research, as it has often been argued that supplier-\nmanufacturer relationships were influenced by recent changes in the manufacturing environment.\nThe research has shown that confusion exists about what relationships are \u2013 in particular the term\n\u2018partnerships\u2019 is used by practitioners to apply to a range of relationships. What are the main\ndimensions of relationships? \u2018Closeness\u2019 appears as one major dimension, but what are the other\ndimensions? Furthermore, what factors constitute \u2018closeness\u2019 \u2013 is it the social distance, cultural\ndistance, technological distance, time distance and geographical distance, as for instance, Ford\n(1980) suggested? What comprises the quality of supplier-manufacturer relationships in today\u2019s\nmanufacturing industry? Future research needs to probe purchasing managers perceptions deeper\nthan what can be identified by telephone interviews. These are worthwhile research streams and it\nwould be fruitful to pursue them using a multi-method case-study design. Obviously, the cultural\ncontext in Germany may be strongly influencing supplier-manufacturer relationships. If this is the\ncase, German manufacturers may be missing the opportunity to improve product quality, delivery\ntimes, innovation processes beside other issues.\nRamifications for manufacturing companies\nThe project also has ramifications for manufacturers and suppliers. On the one hand,\nmanufacturers need to understand that partnerships should consist of more than rhetoric and should\nbe managed to produce an improvement in manufacturing performance. The multi-sourcing strategy\nneeds to be revisited, as true partnership should give better returns in simple scenarios, where the\nsupplier can contribute more to innovation. How a manufacturer manages the \u2018portfolio\u2019 of\nrelationships with suppliers could be a key source of competitive advantage. Suppliers need to be\n25\nencouraged to submit their ideas and systems needs to be set in place to channel these suggestions to\nthe appropriate places (e.g., R&D department). Regular meetings as well as the exchange of\nengineers with selected partners seem to be the way forward. On the other hand, suppliers need to\ndemonstrate their innovation potential and their R&D capabilities if they would like to consolidate\ntheir future place in the supply base as the manufacturer\u2019s partner. They need to assemble a \u2018full\nservice package\u2019 which is attractive enough for manufacturers to treat them as sole long-term\nbusiness partners \u2013 fulfilling price, delivery and quality requirements is not good enough any longer.\nOur study indicates some areas where German companies can take immediate action to improve\ntheir manufacturing performance. Close relationships with innovative and high-performing suppliers\nare the key to how this can be achieved. Currently, there is a debate in Germany about the\ninternational competitiveness of its manufacturing industry, and has become generally know as the\nStandort Deutschland discussion. This debate centres on the issue of whether Germany is a viable\nlocation for manufacturing \u2013 some companies have been questioning the viability of producing in\nGermany (Fischer and Allen, 1998). Unfortunately, the debate in Germany has too often focused\nonly on the negative impact of high labour and social costs on the competitiveness of German\nmanufacturing industry (e.g., Rexrodt, 1997). Although these issues should not be ignored, it also\nneeds to be recognised that individual German manufacturers have little influence over the political\nissues that determine social costs and how quickly they will be addressed. Companies have other\nopportunities to improve their performance now. Our analysis has shown that supplier-manufacturer\nrelationships provide a very practical opportunity for German manufacturers to move forward. One\narea where manufacturers have the power to improve is product innovation. With the goal of greater\nproduct innovation the manufacturer and suppliers can work together to become more competitive.\nTo be more innovative the German manufacturers need to create partnerships with some of their\nsuppliers. To help companies do this, researchers need to capture the key ingredients of successful\n26\npartnerships now in order to contribute positive ideas and solutions to the Standort Deutschland\ndebate.\nOverall, the research shows that appropriate use of partnerships offer a means for manufacturers\nto improve performance. Unfortunately, the empirical evidence on how partnerships can best be\nformed is currently weak. Researchers urgently need to address this, as the information is highly\nrelevant to practitioners in today\u2019s competitive manufacturing environment.\nReferences\nAlreck, P. L. and Settle, R. B.

Good\n\u201cIf you asked me directly, I can tell you that the\nrelationships with our suppliers are very good\u201d\n(Purchasing Manager in Engineering)\nX (14)\n2. Partnership-like\n\u201cOur relationships are partnership-like, which\nsums it up pretty much\u201d (Purchasing Manager in\nProcess)\nX (9)\n3. Co-operative\n\u201cWe are co-operative. So, working together does\nnot only mean to speaking about things \u2013 actions\nneed to be carried out together., \u2026, It is a co-\noperative effort and meetings are scheduled on a\nregular basis.\u201d (Purchasing Manager in\nEngineering).\nX (5)\n4. Normal \/\nReasonable\n\u201cOur relationships are normal and based on\nwhat any purchasing manager would reasonably\nexpect.\u201d (Purchasing Manager in Electronics).\nX (4)\n5. Open\n\u201cIn my experience, our relationships are open\nwhich allows us to address issues in an\nuncomplicated fashion.\u201d (Managing Director in\nEngineering).\nX (3)\n6. Understanding \/\nHelpful\n\u201cThe supplier has to understand our problems\nand has also to be helpful in solving these. I\nhave the feeling that these are the suppliers\neverybody should look for.\u201d (Managing Director\nin Electronics).\nX (3)\n7. Goal Directed \/\nProfit focus\n\u201cThe bottom-line is the goal in our business and\nso, the supplier relationship has to measure up\nagainst profit.\u201d (Purchasing Manager in\nElectronics).\nX (4)\n8. Human Factor is\nimportant \/\nClimate of trust\n\u201cWe developed our relationships in a way that\nwe were able to establish a climate of trust. The\n\u2018human factor\u2019 is very important to us.\u201d\n(Purchasing Manager in Engineering).\nX (2)\n9. Close\n\u201cOur relationships are, \u2026, close, \u2026,. In my\nview, being close means that different functions\nshould work together on several levels.\u201d\n(Managing Director Engineering).\nX (1)\n10. Direct\n\u201cOur relationship is not so much at an\norganisational level, but more on a one-to-one\nbasis. Hence, the contact is very direct.\u201d\n(Managing Director in Process).\nX (1)\n37\nCharacteristic Quotes Tangible Intangible\n11. Liberal\n\u201cWe are highly liberal. Yes, we want to earn\nmoney, but I don\u2019t have any advantage if an\nexcellent supplier cannot deliver components in\ntwo years time. Based on our understanding,\nthere is always a way around problems.\u201d\n(Managing Director in Engineering).\nX (1)\n12. Long-term\nperspective\n\u201cOur relationships are built for the long-term\nand are therefore sealed with a long-term\ncontract.\u201d (Managing Director in Process).\nX (1)\n13. Fair \/ \u201cGiving\nand Taking\u201d\n\u201cIn general, the relationship has to do with\n\u2018giving and taking.\u2019 For instance, sometimes we\nforget to order parts on time and the supplier\nsends an unscheduled lorry on his expenses. At\nanother time, I will order parts from my\npreferred supplier although another source\ncould be considered. This is just fair and this\nsituation I would describe as \u2018giving and\ntaking.\u2019\u201d (Purchasing Manager in Electronics).\nX (1)\nFrequency 14 35\nTable III: Characteristics of Manufacturer-Supplier Relationships\n38\nProportion Frequency\n71%-100% 3\n51%-70% 3\n21%-50% 12\n11%-20% 7\n<10% 9\nTotal 34\nTable IV: Proportion of the Supply Base with which Manufacturers have Partnerships\n39\nChange or Relationship Quote Frequency\nRelationship became\nmore close (partnership)\n\u201cOver the last four years, our relationships became much\ncloser. This may be due to the fact that we got to know\neach other better over time so that a partnership could be\ndeveloped.\u201d (Purchasing Manager in Process).\n17\nRelationship became\nmore distant\n\u201cToday, many business contacts became anonymous. The\n\u2018human factor\u2019 is not so important any longer and the\nrelationship is therefore more distant. People are\nreplaceable, the system \u2013 I mean the organisation as a\nwhole \u2013 counts.\u201d (Managing Director in Engineering).\n5\nOther changes*\n\u201cRelationships became more performance oriented,\nwhich takes away the time needed to nurture our\ncontacts.\u201d (Purchasing Manager in Engineering).\n3\nNo changes\n\u201cThe relationships haven\u2019t really changed. After all, we\nare the same people that work together.\u201d (Purchasing\nManager in Electronics).\n9\nTotal 34\n* Other changes were \u2018more performance oriented\u2019 \/ \u2018more joint working processes\u2019 \/ \u2018more co-operation and trust.\u2019\nTable V: Recent Changes in Supplier-Manufacturer Relationships\n40\nSupplier Category Frequency\nABC in terms of \u2018Volume\u2019 27\nABC in term of \u2018Quality\u2019 15\nABC in term of \u2018Delivery\u2019 9\nABC in terms of \u2018Price\u2019 3\nABC in terms of \u2018Risk\/Dependency\u2019 2\nTable VI: Supplier Categorisation Criteria (Top 5)\n41\nSourcing Strategy Frequency\nMulti 17\nDual 14\nSingle 3\nTotal 34\nTable VII: Predominant Sourcing Strategy\n42\nAnswer Is an Email System in Place?\nYes 24 (71%)\nNo 10 (29%)\nTable VIII: Email System for Information Exchange between Manufacturers and Suppliers\n43\nInformation Content OrderDetails\nTechnical\nDetails\nStrategic\nDetails Frequency\nDelivery X 21\nPrices X 20\nQuality X 19\nQuantity X 6\n(Technical) Drawings \/ Construction Information X 5\nSupplier\u2019s (new) skills, suggestions, ideas, expertise X 5\nMarket trends X 5\nMaterials information X 4\nPurchasing orders X 4\nNegotiation records, contracts X 3\nConfirmation of orders X 2\nTechnical data X 2\nProduction Processes X 2\nProblems (including personal issues) X 2\nOffers, counterproposals X 2\nProduct specification X 2\nDesign drafts and sketches X 2\nNew business directions and new scenarios X 1\nData processing and IT connections X 1\nPackaging X 1\nChanges in product and process designs X 1\nService information X 1\nReliability information X 1\nFrequency 81 17 14 112\nTable IX: Information Content\n44\nAnswer Exchange of Engineers Meetings with Suppliers\nYes 28 (82%) 22 (65%)\nNo 6 (18%) 12 (35%)\nTable X: Exchange of Engineers and Meetings with Suppliers\n45\nAPPENDIX A.
