In some of the world\u2019s lan-\nguages it is pervasive, while in others it is absent. Despite extensive research,\nagreement remains deeply puzzling. There was a time when it was treated\nmainly as a tool for researching other syntactic phenomena. Yet there has also\nbeen a tradition of recognizing it as a challenging problem in its own right. Indeed\nagreement presents serious problems for all our theories of syntax. It is therefore\nworth looking first at the reasons for the continuing interest in agreement (\u00a71.1).\nPart of this comes from the way in which it involves so many components of\ngrammar (\u00a71.2). The terminology has become somewhat confused, so I clarify\nthe terms I shall use (\u00a71.3). The substantial part of this chapter lays out the canoni-\ncal approach to agreement (\u00a71.4), which will form the basis for my typology. I then\noutline the way in which the book is structured (\u00a71.5), and present background\ninformation which should be of value to the reader (\u00a71.6).\n1.1 The special interest of agreement\nConsider the following idea:\nHypothesis I: Grammatical information will be found only together with the lexical\nitem to which it is relevant. (False)\nThis hypothesis suggests a situation which is iconic, functional, sensible and\nunderstandable. Compare dog and dogs, where number is marked in accordance\nwith the hypothesis, or compute and computed, where tense is similarly marked.\nThis entire book presents evidence to show that Hypothesis I is also wrong.\nIt is surprising that grammatical meaning can be \u2018displaced\u2019 (Moravcsik 1988:\n90), in other words, that one word can carry the grammatical meaning relevant to\nanother. This is what happens in agreement:\n(1) Mary makes pancakes.\nHere makes is singular because Mary is an individual; even if she makes pancakes\nfrequently, the number of \u2018pancake making events\u2019 will not affect the agreement\nof the verb. The verb form tells us how many Marys there are, not how many\nmakings there are. Thus the number information on the verb is displaced. This\n1\nP1: FYX\/FGC P2: FXS\n0521807085c01.xml CUUK358B-Corbett December 17, 2005 15:4\n2 1 introduct ion\ndisplaced information, or \u2018information in the wrong place\u2019, is not a minor issue.\nAgreement affects different components of grammar, as we shall see in the next\nsection.\n1.2 The place of agreement\nTake another simple example like:\n(2) The cooks make pancakes.\nWe need to specify that the form make \u223c makes varies according to the subject\n(there is no effect if we change the object pancakes to bread, for example). Clearly,\nthen, agreement is a matter of syntax, since the syntactic role of the items involved\nis of importance. But now compare:\n(3) The committee has agreed.\n(4) The committee have agreed.\nHere there is a choice in some varieties of English, notably in British English.\nThat is, there is a choice here, but not with Mary in (1) above. Why not? Because\nMary is an individual, whereas committee may be conceptualized as an entity or\nas several individuals. Clearly, then, agreement is also a matter of semantics.\nParticularly if we start from English data, we might think that agreement is all\na matter of semantics, an idea put most consistently in Dowty & Jacobson (1989).\nWe could argue that the singular verb in (1) results from semantic compatibility\nwith a singular actor, and the plural in (2) similarly from a plural actor. However,\nthere are three types of problem with such a view.\nConsider first these examples from Morgan (1984: 235):\n(5) More than one person has failed this exam.\n(6) Fewer than two people have failed this exam.\nHere we can see that the agreement of the verb depends on the grammatical\nnumber of the subject (shown by person versus people) and not on the meaning\nof the sentence (semantic plural in (5) and singular in (6));1 another type of\nsupporting example is given in \u00a75.6.3.\nThere is a more general second argument that agreement cannot be entirely\nsemantic which involves agreement in grammatical gender, in languages like\nRussian:\nRussian\n(7) Lamp-a stoja-l-a v ugl-u\nlamp(f)-sg stand-pst-f.sg in corner-sg.loc\n\u2018The lamp was standing in the corner.\u2019\n1 For the form of pronouns with such phrases see Gil (2001).\nP1: FYX\/FGC P2: FXS\n0521807085c01.xml CUUK358B-Corbett December 17, 2005 15:4\n1.2 The place of agreement 3\nIn this example there is no semantic reason for lampa \u2018lamp\u2019 to be of feminine\ngender.2 A similar argument can be made with grammatical number in English.\nThe use of plural agreement with English scissors does not, for many linguists at\nleast, have a semantic justification.\nThe third argument is that even when there are semantic reasons for a particular\ntype of agreement, the domain in which this is possible is determined by syntax.\nThe committee have agreed is fine in British English (as in (4)), which suggests that\ncommittee takes agreement according to its meaning. And yet *these committee\nis quite unacceptable. It is syntax which determines when agreement according\nto meaning is possible. We shall see many more examples of such mismatches in\nagreement in chapter 5. And evidence from acquisition also supports the syntactic\nbasis of agreement in English (\u00a79.3). Thus an adequate theory requires reference\nboth to syntactic and to semantic information (Pullum 1984).\nNow consider for contrast:\n(8) The committee agreed.\n(9) Mary made pancakes.\n(10) The cooks made pancakes.\nHere we see no evidence of agreement. Past tense verbs in English do not show\nagreement. Clearly, then, agreement is a matter of morphology (word structure)\nsince we require the morphology to provide the opportunity for agreement to\nbe indicated. Indeed agreement is arguably the major interface problem between\nmorphology and syntax, and hence appears particularly difficult when viewed\nfrom the heartland of either component.\nThere is a single exception to the statement about the past tense in English,\nnamely the verb be which distinguishes number in the past (was \u223c were). This\nis something that has to be stated individually for this verb, in its lexical entry.\nWe conclude that agreement is a matter which may have to be specified in the\nlexicon; it is a matter of lexicology.\nIt is tempting to try to treat all such specific irregularities within the lexicon, but\nsome apply so broadly that this approach cannot be right. Consider this example:\nRussian (19th century, from Turgenev\u2019s Nakanune \u2018On the Eve\u2019, 1860)\n(11) \u0001Mamen\u00b4 ka plac\u02c7-ut, \u2014 s\u02c7epnu-l-a ona vsled uxodivs\u02c7-ej\nMother cry-3pl whisper-pst-f.sg she after leaving-f.sg.dat\nElene, a papen\u00b4 ka gnevaj-ut-sja . . .\u0002\nElena.dat and father be.angry-3pl-refl\n\u2018Your mother is crying\u2019, she whispered after Elena, who was leaving,\n\u2018and your father is angry . . .\u2019\nThe speaker is a maid, talking in turn about her mistress and her master. Here the\nplural verbs with singular subjects indicate that the speaker is showing respect\n2 Dowty & Jacobson (1989: 98\u2013101) discuss the problem of gender and attempt to meet the objection,\nby suggesting that a real-world property of objects is the word which is used by convention to\ndenote that class of objects. This is hardly convincing, in my view.\nP1: FYX\/FGC P2: FXS\n0521807085c01.xml CUUK358B-Corbett December 17, 2005 15:4\n4 1 introduct ion\nfor the people referred to. There are all sorts of items which could appear in this\nconstruction. They cannot be restricted to particular lexical items, rather a range\nof noun phrases may be involved. The generalization involves the situation: this\nagreement occurs when the speaker wishes to show respect (to the referents of\nthe noun phrases agreed with). Hence agreement can be a matter of pragmatics.\nAgreement is increasingly recognized as of interest not just for core areas\nof linguistics like syntax and morphology, but also more widely, in work on\nacquisition and in psycholinguistics, for instance, which are topics I take up in\nthe final chapter. Given this interest from \u2018outside\u2019, it is particularly important\nthat we should be talking about the same thing. Unfortunately, the terminology\nis muddled, and important choices in analysis are made sometimes as much by\ntradition as by argument. I therefore will pay attention to key terms and to the\nanalytic choices available.\n1.3 Defining terms\nI have just argued for the need for clarity in terminology. What then\nis it that unites the examples of agreement we have considered so far? Ander-\nson (1992: 103) points out that agreement is \u2018a quite intuitive notion which is\nnonetheless surprisingly difficult to delimit with precision\u2019. Indeed, while several\ndefinitions have been proposed, none is fully satisfactory; see the suggestions by\nKeenan (1978: 167), Lehmann (1982: 203) and Lapointe (1988). There is detailed\ndiscussion of definitional issues in Mel\u00b4 c\u02c7uk (1993) and a formal approach can be\nfound in Avgustinova & Uszkoreit (2003). We shall start from a suggestion by\nSteele:\nThe term agreement commonly refers to some systematic covariance between\na semantic or formal property of one element and a formal property of another.\nSteele (1978: 610)\nThis covers the instances we have seen. The essential notion is covariance. It\nis not sufficient that two items happen to share properties; the sharing must be\nsystematic, and we see this by the fact that as one element varies so will the other.\nSome terms will be useful at this stage, to allow us to generalize about different\ntypes of agreement. We call the element which determines the agreement (say the\nsubject noun phrase) the controller. The element whose form is determined by\nagreement is the target. The syntactic environment in which agreement occurs\n(the clause for instance) is the domain of agreement. And when we indicate in\nwhat respect there is agreement, we are referring to agreement features. Thus\nnumber is an agreement feature, it has the values: singular, dual, plural and so on.\nThis is diagrammed in Figure 1.1.\nFeatures are directly reflected in agreement. There can be other factors (like\nword order) which have an effect on agreement but are not directly reflected like\nP1: FYX\/FGC P2: FXS\n0521807085c01.xml CUUK358B-Corbett December 17, 2005 15:4\n1.3 Defining terms 5\nthe system      works\ncontroller       target\nfeature: number \nvalue: singular\ndomain\ncondition\nFigure 1.1 Framework of terms\nfeatures. Such factors are called agreement conditions. Thus, within a particular\ndomain, a target agrees with a controller in respect of its feature specifications\n(that is, the features and their values); this may be dependent on some other\ncondition being met.\nThese terms are now fairly standard among those working on agreement. For\ncontroller, the term \u2018trigger\u2019 or \u2018source\u2019 is sometimes found. \u2018Category\u2019 may be\nfound in place of \u2018feature\u2019, and \u2018conditioning factor\u2019 for condition. For \u2018probe\u2019\nand \u2018goal\u2019 see \u00a74.2.5. As our terms suggest, there is a clear intuition that agree-\nment is asymmetric. In Mary laughs, most accept that laughs is singular because\nMary is singular. However, it does not follow that we should model it in this\nway. Older accounts of agreement captured the intuition directly by copying fea-\nture specifications from the controller to the target. More recent accounts use\ntechniques like unification, and model the asymmetry less directly. This issue is\nconsidered in \u00a71.4.3, and discussed more fully in \u00a74.1.\nI shall further clarify what is covered by agreement. First I deal with the term\n\u2018concord\u2019 (\u00a71.3.1) and then I examine the relation of agreement to government\n(\u00a71.3.2). My main way forward, however, will be using the notion of canonical\nagreement (\u00a71.4), which will allow us to work with the full range of agreement,\nfrom the core instances of the phenomenon to those at the fringe.\n1.3.1 Agreement and concord \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\nThese innocent terms have led to considerable confusion. For many\nlinguists they are synonymous; the trend is towards the use of \u2018agreement\u2019,3\nwhich is the term I shall use. Some others have distinguished the terms, but they\nhave done so in contradictory and potentially confusing ways. Since some of this\nconfusion remains in the literature, I shall outline two positions, so that readers\ncan be alert to the issues. Readers for whom this is not an issue should go straight\nto \u00a71.3.2.\n3 In a survey of the topic, Moravcsik (1978: 333) gives \u2018agreement (or concord) phenomena\u2019.\nSimilarly Trask (1997: 10) has \u2018agreement (also concord )\u2019. Somewhat earlier, Lyons (1968:\n239) had \u2018concord (or \u2018agreement\u2019)\u2019; this suggests that \u2018agreement\u2019 is on the rise, an impression\nsupported by Anderson (1992: 103) \u2018just what is \u201cagreement\u201d (or as it is often called in the\ntraditional literature, \u201cconcord\u201d)?\u2019\nP1: FYX\/FGC P2: FXS\n0521807085c01.xml CUUK358B-Corbett December 17, 2005 15:4\n6 1 introduct ion\nSome linguists, following Bloomfield (1933: 191\u20134), treat agreement as the\nsuperordinate term. According to Bloomfield (1933: 191), \u2018In a rough way, with-\nout real boundaries, we can distinguish three general types of agreement.\u2019 These\nare \u2018concord\u2019 or \u2018congruence\u2019, which includes agreement within the noun phrase\nand the agreement of predicate verbs, government and cross-reference.4 As was\npredictable, this system of terms has not survived unchanged. One development\nhas been to restrict concord to the noun phrase, which means that the domain of\nagreement is the key part of such definitions.5\nIn contrast to the position of Bloomfield, and developments from it, Greenberg\n(1978: 50) treats concord as the wider term:\nIt would be useful, then, to distinguish the wider notion of concord from\nagreement, the latter being a subtype in which the choice of alternative con-\ncord elements depends on the class to which the stem of the governing item\nbelongs, whether marked by an affix or not.\nGreenberg would include matching in case within the noun phrase as an instance\nof concord. When, however, matching is determined by \u2018the class to which the\nstem of the governing item belongs\u2019, then we have agreement. Greenberg cites\ngender here, and is clearly talking of what we would term a lexical feature.\nNote the contrast between this definition and Bloomfield\u2019s. Most obviously\nthe subset relations are different: for Bloomfield concord is a subset of agree-\nment, while for Greenberg agreement is a subset of concord. But the criteria on\nwhich the relation is based differ too. Bloomfield and several followers draw a\ndistinction according to domain: concord exists in a \u2018smaller\u2019 domain than cross-\nreference. For Greenberg the distinction is based on the type of feature involved:\nagreement involves lexical features, while concord can involve matching of other\nfeatures.6\nThus no distinction is drawn consistently between the terms \u2018agreement\u2019 and\n\u2018concord\u2019, indeed they are used in opposing ways. I shall therefore use just\n4 Bloomfield puts certain pronominal constructions and pro-drop together as cross-reference, and\nincludes them with concord and government under \u2018agreement\u2019, but he treats antecedent-anaphor\nrelations separately.\n5 For example:\nThe term concord traditionally distinguishes this pattern of agreement within DP from the canon-\nical specifier-head type: agreement theory as developed in Chomsky 1993 and related work\naccounts only for the latter. (Carstens 2000: 323)\nNote the distinction; what for Bloomfield counted as concord is cut down to agreement within\nthe determiner phrase, and part of what he treated as concord is treated as the \u2018canonical\u2019 type\nof agreement. The difference in the definitions depends on what is considered the domain of\nagreement.\n6 The domain is not a defining criterion here, indeed Greenberg later talks of \u2018three types of concordial\nphenomena\u2019 and distinguishes in what he calls a \u2018somewhat rough and heuristic fashion\u2019 between\nagreement within the noun phrase, predicate agreement and anaphoric use (1978: 75\u20136). There\nare other ways in which the terms are used. Thus Lehmann (1982: 206, 249\u201350) also distinguishes\nagreement from concord: agreement is the core syntactic phenomenon, which he defines, and\nthe term \u2018concord\u2019 is then used for instances of semantic compatibility, certain classifier-noun\nrelations, for example. But still others use both terms without definition.\nP1: FYX\/FGC P2: FXS\n0521807085c01.xml CUUK358B-Corbett December 17, 2005 15:4\n1.3 Defining terms 7\n\u2018agreement\u2019, as the more current term. There is no particular reason to determine\nmy terms primarily according to the domains of agreement or to the features\ninvolved: both should be a part of the account (as will be the case in my \u2018canoni-\ncal\u2019 approach). Any subdivision of agreement, whether or not \u2018concord\u2019 is used\nas the term, will require a careful definition, since there is no generally accepted\nterminology here.\n1.3.2 Agreement and government \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\nIn the clearest instances of agreement (those I shall later treat as\n\u2018canonical\u2019), agreement can be distinguished from government rather readily.\nThe differences can be illustrated by this example taken from a corpus of spoken\nRussian.\nRussian conversation (Zemskaja & Kapanadze 1978: 251)\n(12) Zna-es\u02c7\u00b4 kak-oj mne vsegda dava-l-a\nknow-2sg what-m.sg.acc 1sg.dat Always give-pst-f.sg\nsovet moj-a mam-a ?\nadvice (m)[sg.acc] my-f.sg.nom mother(fem)-sg\n\u2018Do you know what advice my mother always gave me?\u2019\nThe subject is moja mama \u2018my mother\u2019, and the verb agrees with it. In agreement\nthe feature specification of the target is in the relevant respects the same as that\nof the controller (here feminine singular).7 In turn the verb governs the split noun\nphrase kakoj sovet \u2018what advice\u2019.8 For government it is simply the presence of\nthe verb davat\u00b4 \u2018give\u2019 which requires the accusative case for this noun phrase;\nchanging the form of the verb to, say, the present, does not affect its government\nrequirement (this is point 1 in (13) below). Another way of expressing this is\nto say that the agreement controller has the feature specification required of the\ntarget (i.e. the subject is indeed feminine and singular in my example), while the\ngovernor does not (the verb is not accusative), as in point 2 below. The controller\nof agreement is usually nominal, while targets are of various sorts; conversely,\nthe governor can be varied, but items which are governed are nominal (point 3).\nThe features involved in agreement, typically gender, number and person have\ndirect semantic relevance, to varying degrees (discussed further in \u00a74.2.4), while\ngovernment canonically involves case, which is not directly involved in semantic\ninterpretation (point 4). And finally, if there are multiple targets for an agreement\ncontroller, they will in the canonical instance share the same values (when they\nrealize the same features); thus moja \u2018my\u2019 and davala \u2018gave\u2019 are both feminine\nsingular.9 However, when a single governor governs two governees, they will\n7 This is a further important aspect of \u2018systematic covariance\u2019 in the definition above, namely that\nit is in respect of the same feature.

I shall\nhere restrict myself to agreement in the narrower sense, retaining the sharper\nnotion of the covariance of features, not found in government. Adopting the\nbroader definition would blur this important distinction. While I have treated the\ncanonical instances, there are difficult phenomena falling between these idealiza-\ntions, as we shall see when we consider data from Kayardild (\u00a74.5.2).

Only then do I ask how this space is populated.\nIt follows that canonical instances, which are the best and clearest examples, those\nmost closely matching the \u2018canon\u2019, may well not be the most frequent. They may\nindeed be extremely rare. However, they fix a point from which occurring phe-\nnomena can be calibrated. Then I discuss weakenings of the criteria, which allow\nfor less canonical instances. As these instances no longer fully match the defini-\ntions, they will include some which not all linguists would accept as instances of\nagreement. At several points I introduce here interesting phenomena which are\nthen taken up in more detail in later chapters.\nTo start from an instance of canonical agreement, consider agreement in gender\nin the Italian noun phrase:\nItalian (Pierluigi Cuzzolin, personal communication)12\n(14) il nuov-o quadr-o\ndef.m.sg new-m.sg picture(m)-sg\n\u2018the new picture\u2019\n(15) i nuov-i quadr-i\ndef.m.pl new-m.pl picture(m)-pl\n\u2018the new pictures\u2019\n(16) la nuov-a tel-a\ndef.f.sg new-f.sg painting(f)-sg\n\u2018the new painting\u2019\n(17) le nuov-e tel-e\ndef.f.pl new-f.pl painting(f)-pl\n\u2018the new paintings\u2019\nI shall discuss canonical aspects of such examples in turn. As a brief summary,\nthe canonical aspects of these examples are as follows:\ncontroller: is present, has overt expression of features, and is consistent in the\nagreements it takes, its part of speech is not relevant (this is a vacuous\ncriterion in (14)\u2013(17))\ntarget: has bound expression of agreement, obligatory marking, doubling the\nmarking of the noun, marking is regular, alliterative, productive; the target\nhas a single controller and its part of speech is not relevant\ndomain: agreement is asymmetric (the gender of the adjective depends on that of the\nnoun), local, and the domain is one of multiple domains\nfeatures: lexical (in one instance), matching values, not offering any choice in values\nconditions: no conditions\nFor some readers examples like (14)\u2013(17) will seem familiar; however, it is\nworth reflecting on how interesting they are.

Inherent features (\u00a74.2.3) are given in parentheses.\nThus gender is glossed with the noun stem; it is true that -a on the noun often implies feminine\ngender by the assignment rules (\u00a74.3.1) of Italian, but this is not necessarily so, as with poet-\na \u2018poet\u2019 (masculine); similarly -o often implies masculine, but this is not always the case, as\nwith mano \u2018hand\u2019 (feminine). This glossing may seem over-careful. However, when discussing\nagreement it is important to distinguish between what is inherent and what is contextual.\nP1: FYX\/FGC P2: FXS\n0521807085c01.xml CUUK358B-Corbett December 17, 2005 15:4\n10 1 introduct ion\nHypothesis I. As we shall see, the different canonical aspects of agreement con-\nverge, so that agreement in gender of the modifier with the noun in the noun phrase\nis confirmed as the canonical instance. Phenomena which extend the instances\n\u2018outwards\u2019 are now grouped under the five components (Figure 1.1) of my account\nof agreement.\n1.4.1 Controllers \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\nSeveral of the criteria relate to the controller. An important one is that\ncanonical controllers are present.\nC-1: controller present > controller absent\n(where \u2018>\u2019 means \u2018more canonical than\u2019)\nCompare these two similar examples:\nRussian\n(18) ty c\u02c7ita-es\u02c7\u00b4\n2sg.nom read-2sg\n\u2018you are reading\u2019\nSerbian\/Croatian\/Bosnian\n(19) c\u02c7it-as\u02c7\nread-2sg\n\u2018you are reading\u2019\nIn such sentences in Russian the controller is typically present, while in\nSerbian\/Croatian\/Bosnian13 typically it is not. I treat as canonical what is some-\ntimes called \u2018grammatical agreement\u2019 rather than \u2018anaphoric agreement\u2019 (Bresnan\n& Mchombo 1987, Siewierska 1999, Bresnan 2001a: 151). An effect of adopt-\ning criterion 1 is that, for the construction we are discussing, the canonical type\nis restricted to relatively few languages, since the omission of subject pronouns\n(often referred to as \u2018pro drop\u2019) is common. It is important to stress that canonical\nis not necessarily what is \u2018normal\u2019 or \u2018common\u2019. Several familiar examples of\nlanguages where pronominal subjects are normally included come from northern\nEurope (English and German being obvious examples).14\nWhile discussions of \u2018dropping\u2019 concentrate on pronouns, I am making a more\ngeneral point here: it is more canonical for any controller to be present rather\nthan absent. For agreement of the adjective with the noun within the domain\nof noun phrase, it is more canonical for the noun to be present; similarly in\n13 I use this designation for the South Slavonic varieties spoken in Bosnia-Hercegovina, Croatia,\nMontenegro and Serbia, since linguistically they show considerable similarity. An account of the\nbreakup of Serbo-Croat is given in Greenberg (2004).\n14 A particularly interesting less familiar example is Skou (New Guinea), which has elaborate\nagreement marking (to be discussed in \u00a73.2.3 and \u00a73.2.4) and which normally includes subject\npronouns: the third person pronouns are regularly included and first and second person pronouns\nare present more often than not (Mark Donohue, personal communication). Siewierska (2004b:\n268\u201370) suggests in addition: the Papuan languages Au, Ekari, Koiari and Vanimo, and the\nAustronesian languages Anejom, Fehan and Labu.\nP1: FYX\/FGC P2: FXS\n0521807085c01.xml CUUK358B-Corbett December 17, 2005 15:4\n1.4 Canonical agreement 11\npossessor-possessed agreement it is more canonical for the \u2018possessed\u2019 to be\npresent.\nC-2: controller has overt expression of agreement features > controller has\ncovert expression of agreement features\nCompare these French examples:\nFrench\n(20) elle est content-e\n3sg.f be.prs.3sg happy-f.sg\n\u2018she is happy\u2019\n(21) je suis content \/ content-e\n1sg be.prs.1sg happy[m.sg] \/ happy-f.sg\n\u2018I am happy\u2019\nIn (20) the controller is overtly feminine: the pronoun elle \u2018she\u2019 contrasts with il\n\u2018he\u2019. In (21) there is no distinction in the controller for gender (it is underspecified\nfor gender). We treat examples like (20) as canonical in this respect, rather than\nthose like (21). Another way of stating this criterion is that a canonical controller\nmarks at least as many distinctions as the target. It does so in two respects: in\nterms of the number of features and in terms of their values. These examples\nmake clear that I am comparing constructions and even particular examples in\nterms of canonicity: even within a given language one construction can show\nmore canonical agreement than another.\nOn the basis of these criteria, and others to be considered below, a more general\nprinciple may be suggested (compare Moravcsik 1988: 90):\nPrinciple I: Canonical agreement is redundant rather than informative\nThis principle fits well with the definition of agreement in \u00a71.3. In the French\nexample elle est contente \u2018she is happy\u2019 the feminine feature is available from the\ncontroller (criterion 2). In je suis content(e) \u2018I am happy\u2019 it is not. Agreement in\nthe canonical example is redundant. Similarly, English examples like the horse is \/\nthe horses are are more canonical than the sheep is \/ are. The situation where there\nis no controller present, and hence the only information about the controller is\nthat supplied by the target, is non-canonical (though, as we noted, it is commonly\nfound); this is the point of criterion 1.\nLet us continue with other criteria relating to controllers.\nC-3: consistent controller > hybrid controller\nA consistent controller is one which controls a consistent agreement pattern.\nThis is more canonical than one which controls different feature values. The\nnotion \u2018consistent agreement pattern\u2019 is intuitively straightforward, but not quite\nso easy to define (for the details see Corbett 1991: 176\u201381 and \u00a75.4.1 below). As\na first characterization, a consistent agreement pattern is the set of agreements\ncontrolled by a typical regular controller. A hybrid controller, on the other hand,\nP1: FYX\/FGC P2: FXS\n0521807085c01.xml CUUK358B-Corbett December 17, 2005 15:4\n12 1 introduct ion\ntakes agreements from more than one such pattern. It controls different feature\nvalues on different targets. An example can be found in Bulgarian:\nBulgarian (Osenova 2003: 666)\n(22) Negov-o Velic\u02c7estv-o e dos\u02c7a\u02d8l\nhis-n.sg Majesty(n)-sg aux.3sg come.pst[m.sg]\n\u2018his Majesty has come\u2019\nNeuter agreement is found in the noun phrase, but masculine in the verbal pred-\nicate, and so the same controller takes different agreements according to the\ntarget. A consistent controller would take either neuter or masculine (or femi-\nnine) agreements, irrespective of the target: that is, it would have a consistent\nagreement pattern.\nC-4: controller\u2019s part of speech is irrelevant > is relevant (given the domain)\nThe idea is that given a domain, for instance, subject-predicate agreement, in the\ncanonical case we do not need further information on the part of speech of the\ncontroller. For instance, in Russian we do not need to have different rules for a\nsubject noun phrase headed by a noun as compared to one headed by a pronoun.\nSometimes, however, the difference is substantial. A good example is Bayso,\nwhere the rules are rather different for pronouns as compared with nouns. This\ncomplex situation will be analysed in \u00a75.9.\nThese two criteria fall under a second general principle:\nPrinciple II: Canonical agreement is syntactically simple\nAgreement varies from examples which can be captured by a relatively simple\nrule, to those which are exceptionally complex. The two criteria, C-3 and C-4,\nboth point to agreement phenomena which can be captured by simple and general\nrules.\n1.4.2 Targets \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\nThe largest number of criteria relate to the target. This makes sense,\nsince it is the target which is the locus of agreement. These target criteria are often\nintertwined, though as we shall see they can be untangled in some systems.\nI begin with the nature of the expression of agreement on the target, something\nI shall discuss in more detail in chapter 3. Stated in the most general terms, a\nmajor criterion is:\nC-5: bound > free\nWe are concerned with the expression of agreement here. Some define agreement\nsuch that its expression must be bound to the target; for example, Ka\u00a8llstro\u00a8m\n(1993: 272). Matthews\u2019 definition of agreement also has this effect: \u2018Syntactic\nrelation between words and phrases which are compatible, in a given construction,\nby virtue of inflections carried by at least one of them.\u2019 (1997: 12). Others are\nP1: FYX\/FGC P2: FXS\n0521807085c01.xml CUUK358B-Corbett December 17, 2005 15:4\n1.4 Canonical agreement 13\nmore liberal. To discuss alternative possible stances on this, let us expand out the\ncriterion:\nC-5 :\u00b4 inflectional marking (affix) > clitic > free word\nThe canonical expression of agreement is through affixes bound to the target, that\nis, through concatenative inflectional morphology. Let us accept this \u2018anchoring\u2019\nof the hierarchy (we shall return to the means of inflectional marking below) and\nconsider the other possibilities. Some treat certain uses of clitics as agreement.\nAccording to Halpern (1998: 105) verbal clitics \u2018are often assumed to be types\nof inflectional affixes themselves, perhaps simply agreement markers\u2019. On the\nother hand: \u2018there are also several respects in which clitics are not like canonical\nagreement affixes\u2019.\nThere seems to be no argument about inflectional marking being more canon-\nical than the use of clitics; some consider clitics (particularly in clitic doubling\nconstructions) to be an expression of agreement, some exclude them.15 Here is\nan example from the South Slavonic language Macedonian:\nMacedonian (Victor Friedman 1993: 285 and personal communication)\n(23) kuc\u02c7e-to ja=kasa mac\u02c7ka-ta\ndog-def.n.sg 3sg.f.acc=bite[3sg] cat-def.f.sg\n\u2018the dog bites the cat\u2019\nIn (23) the clitic ja \u2018doubles\u2019 the noun phrase mac\u02c7kata \u2018the cat\u2019; I mark clitic\nboundaries with \u2018=\u2019. The clitic is singular and feminine, like its controller. In\nsuch examples, where the object is definite (which is an example of an agree-\nment condition, the topic of chapter 6), there must be a doubling clitic pronoun\n(Friedman 1993: 285). Of course, clitics vary as to \u2018how bound\u2019 they are; verbal\nclitics are \u2018more bound\u2019 than second position clitics, and so are somewhat closer\nto being canonical agreement. I take up this issue in \u00a73.2.3.\nWe should now ask whether a free word can be an expression of agreement. It is\nimportant to be clear that we are looking at the expression of agreement, not just at\na potential stem or host. A predicate verb is a common target, but it acts as a stem\n(for inflectional marking) or a host (for a clitic), but is not itself the expression of\nagreement. (The distinction merges particularly easily with pronouns, where an\nanaphoric pronoun may function as such, and be a target for agreement, or may\ndevelop into a form which loses its anaphoric function and be considered, at least\nby some, to be entirely an expression of agreement: see Lehmann 1982: 234\u201341\nfor early discussion, Siewierska 1999, and \u00a79.1 below).\nPotentially convincing examples of free words as the expression of agreement\nare found in Daly languages of north Australia. For instance, Ngan\u2019gityemerri\n15 See Harris (2002: 110\u201313) for discussion. Woolford (2003) uses \u2018cross-referencing\u2019 as a general\nterm covering referencing of arguments by clitics and by inflection, with \u2018agreement\u2019 reserved\nfor the latter; this is a good convention, when one is concerned primarily with the domain of the\nclause.\nP1: FYX\/FGC P2: FXS\n0521807085c01.xml CUUK358B-Corbett December 17, 2005 15:4\n14 1 introduct ion\n(Reid 1997), a Daly language with two dialects, Ngan\u2019gikurunggurr and\nNgan\u2019giwumirri, and with 100 speakers, 300 miles south-west of Darwin,\nAustralia, has arguably fifteen genders. Of these, six genders have optional free-\nform generics\/classifiers:\nNgan\u2019gityemerri (Reid 1997: 177)\n(24) (syiri) magulfu (syiri) marrgu\nstrike cylindrical.fighting.stick strike new\n\u2018a new cylindrical fighting stick\u2019\nSyiri is the free-form generic for weapon-like objects which have a striking type\nof contact. In its first use in (24) it is analogous to a classifier. In its second use it is\nmore like an agreement marker. The repetition of this free form in the noun phrase\nis, according to one\u2019s point of view, an example of agreement with a free word as\nthe expression of agreement, or else a phenomenon on the edge of agreement.16\nThere is strong evidence that such free-form generics can develop into agreement\nmarkers, as shown by Ngan\u2019gityemerri, where the generics are still feeding the\ngender system (Reid 1997: 211\u201322); we return to this in \u00a79.1.1.\nC-6: obligatory > optional\nCanonical agreement is marked obligatorily; optional marking is less canoni-\ncal. This criterion is linked to the previous one (since inflectional marking is\nusually obligatory), but the two can vary independently. We find optional inflec-\ntional marking of agreement, if rarely, while less canonical types of marking\nare more likely than inflectional marking to be optional. An example is again\nNgan\u2019gityemerri (Reid 1997). Of the fifteen genders, nine are distinguished by\nthe agreements found on agreement targets, such as adjectives:\n(25) a-syensyerrgimi a=tyentyenmuy\nanimate-white.rock.wallaby animate=tame\n\u2018a tame white rock wallaby\u2019\nReid argues that the marker on the head noun is a prefix, while that on the\nagreement target is a proclitic, on the basis of stress and assimilation processes\n(1997: 212\u201315). The important point for us is that the use of these agreement\nmarkers on targets is optional (1997: 168). (We might think the language has\ntwo different systems, based on generics and on proclitics, but this is not the\ncase, since in some genders there is a generic available in addition to a proclitic\nagreement marker.) As noted earlier, like the proclitic agreement markers, the\ngenerics\/classifiers are optional.\nThese instances of optionality of agreement are less canonical than, for exam-\nple, the Italian examples (14)\u2013(17), where agreement is obligatory. We shall meet\n16 If it is agreement, we must ask what the target is. A possible answer would be that it is the\nadditional classifier \u2018slot\u2019 in the noun phrase which is made available by the presence of the\nqualifying element.\nP1: FYX\/FGC P2: FXS\n0521807085c01.xml CUUK358B-Corbett December 17, 2005 15:4\n1.4 Canonical agreement 15\nfurther examples in \u00a76.7.1. Examples are frequent when we look at clitic doubling.\nThe closely related South Slavonic languages Macedonian and Bulgarian both\nhave clitic doubling for objects (as well as inflectional subject agreement). Earlier\nwe looked at Macedonian and noted that clitic doubling is obligatory under certain\ncircumstances. In Bulgarian clitic doubling is \u2018generally optional\u2019 (Scatton 1993:\n234). There are circumstances in which it is required, but overall it is found less\nthan in Macedonian. Thus, if clitic doubling is included as a type of agreement,\nwe can say that the type found in Macedonian is closer to canonical agreement\nthan that of Bulgarian.\nLet us move on to the morphology of the agreement marking. There are three\nrelevant criteria here, which we consider in turn.\nC-7: regular > suppletive\nThe canonical marking is by regular inflectional morphology (affixation). Perhaps\nsurprisingly, we also find instances of agreement being expressed by suppletion.\nNorwegian (Bokma\u02dal, Tore Nesset, personal communication)\n(26) en lit-en bil\none\/a small-m.sg car[sg]\n\u2018one small car\u2019\n(27) to sma\u02da bil-er\ntwo small.pl car-pl\n\u2018two small cars\u2019\nHere we see number agreement expressed through suppletion; for other adjectives\nit is expressed regularly.\nThis criterion is logically independent of the others, which is worth bearing\nin mind below when, in the discussion of domains, I ask whether the English\npronouns he\/she\/it\/they show agreement with their antecedent. One reason why\nsome say this cannot be agreement, almost automatically, is that the pronouns\nwould then show suppletive expression of gender and number. We can examine\nthe domain question in other languages where the suppletion issue can be fac-\ntored out, for instance in Russian where the third person pronoun on\/ona\/ono\/oni\n\u2018he\/she\/it\/they\u2019 is not suppletive (at least in the nominative); we continue with\nthis point about pronouns in the discussion of (37) below.\nC-8: alliterative > opaque\nThis criterion is related to the last but differs from it. Consider this example from\nSwahili; here \u20187\u2019 indicates the singular of the Swahili 7\/8 gender (Corbett 1991:\n43\u201349):\nSwahili (Welmers 1973: 171)\n(28) ki-kapu ki-kubwa ki-moja ki-lianguka\nsg-basket(7\/8) 7-large 7-one 7-fell\n\u2018one large basket fell\u2019\nP1: FYX\/FGC P2: FXS\n0521807085c01.xml CUUK358B-Corbett December 17, 2005 15:4\n16 1 introduct ion\nTwo characteristics of this type of agreement system deserve attention, and both\nmay be found to a greater or lesser degree.\n1. the agreement marker on the target is identical to a formant of the\ncontroller17\nIn (28) the initial ki- on the noun kikapu \u2018basket\u2019 is indeed identical to the marker\nfound on various agreement targets in the sentence. But this is not invariably the\ncase in Swahili, as we see if we look at a different gender, the 3\/4 gender:\n(29) m-shale u-lianguka\nsg-nail(3\/4) 3-fell\n\u2018a nail fell\u2019\nHere the agreement marker does not match the noun prefix, and so the system\nis not fully alliterative. English has a particularly opaque system in this respect,\nin having -s and allomorphs as the marker of the plural on controllers, but as the\nmarker of the singular on verb targets.18\nMy second characteristic of alliterative agreement is:\n2. the same agreement marker is used for different agreement targets\nIn a fully canonical system all targets take the same form. If we have, say, an\nadjective, numeral and verb agreeing in gender with a given noun, the agreement\nmarker will be identical, and there will be no variation in agreement within word\nclasses (for example, all verbs will behave identically). In example (28) we found\nki- on each target. Contrast this with Swahili gender 1\/2 (Welmers 1973: 171):\n(30) m-tu m-moja a-likuja\nsg-person(1\/2) 1-one 1-came\n\u2018one person came\u2019\nThe numeral takes an alliterative form, while the verb, with the prefixed form a-,\ndoes not. Again languages vary: some have identical or extremely similar agree-\nment forms, others show considerable variation (see, for instance, the discussion\nof Tsakhur in \u00a73.3.3).\nThus alliterative agreement is one pole of a scale along which agreement sys-\ntems can be measured. It may be that no language has totally consistent alliterative\nagreement, but many Bantu languages show the phenomenon to a high degree,\nwith systems considerably more consistent than that of Swahili. Particularly\n17 This point relates back to the second criterion, according to which overt expression of agreement\nfeatures on the controller is more canonical than covert expression. That criterion is concerned\nwith the fact of overt marking; such marking may or may not be reflected in phonologically\nsimilar forms of the target, which is what criterion 8 is about. The second point is independent of\ncriterion 2; the targets may have the same marker, even if this is not found on the controller.\n18 For the different status of this inflection in African American Vernacular English see Poplack &\nTagliamonte (1989, 1994) and Green (2002: 99\u2013102); see particularly Godfrey & Tagliamonte\n(1999) for references, for an account of the origins of the system of African American English,\nand for the \u2018Northern Subject Rule\u2019 (discussed in \u00a77.7.4). The general oddness of the various\nEnglish systems is pointed out by Hudson (1999).\nP1: FYX\/FGC P2: FXS\n0521807085c01.xml CUUK358B-Corbett December 17, 2005 15:4\n1.4 Canonical agreement 17\nconsistent alliterative systems are found elsewhere in the Niger-Congo group\n(see \u00a73.5.1 for references).\nC-9: productive marking of agreement > sporadic marking\nThe canonical situation is for each potential target of a given type to show agree-\nment. Thus in Russian every verb shows agreement in number. Compare this with\nthe Nakh-Daghestanian languages Chechen and Ingush, where only around 30%\nof the verbs show agreement (Bickel & Nichols forthcoming; Ingush is discussed\nin \u00a73.3.3). Agreement may be much more sporadic. As an extreme case, in Kuwaa,\na Kru language (a group within Niger-Congo), only one adjective retains agree-\nment in number.19 This criterion is distinct from criterion 6 (obligatory agreement\nis more canonical than optional agreement), in that here we are comparing items\nacross the lexicon, whereas for criterion 6 we assume that agreement is possible\nand ask whether it is then obligatory or not.\nThese last five target criteria we have discussed can be seen as aspects of a\nsingle principle:\nPrinciple III: The closer the expression of agreement is to canonical\n(i.e. affixal) inflectional morphology, the more canonical it is\nas agreement.\nI develop the notion of canonical inflectional morphology in \u00a73.2. We now go\non to three criteria which concern the target from a wider perspective, and which\nfall under the principle of syntactic simplicity. The first relates back to the earlier\ndiscussion of doubling:\nC-10: target always agrees > target agrees only when controller is absent\nA target shows more canonical agreement if the agreement occurs irrespective of\nthe presence or absence of the controller. That is, the target must agree, rather than\ndoing so only when the controller is absent. This criterion relates to and further\nspecifies the controller criterion C-1 \u2018controller present > controller absent\u2019. We\nneed two criteria in order to generalize both over types of controller and over\ntypes of target.\nMy example concerns the agreement of possessive forms in Chukchi, which\nare formed from nouns by suffixation (Skorik 1961: 240\u20131). When functioning\nas an attributive, such possessives can agree in number with the head noun, but\nthey do so only rarely (this is therefore another example of optional agreement,\nwhich is less canonical than obligatory agreement, according to criterion 6). The\nmain point here is that these forms are more likely to take the plural marker when\nthe noun controller is absent than when it is present (Skorik 1961: 233).\n19 The Kuwaa adjective is cited in Marchese (1988: 335), acknowledging a personal communication\nfrom R. Thompson. More generally on criterion 9, it might be thought that this criterion is of a\ndifferent order, that any phenomenon is better illustrated by non-sporadic instances. The criterion\nhas more weight than this, in that we find that those languages which have agreement which is\ncanonical according to a significant number of other criteria tend to be those in which it is also\nexpressed by productive morphology.\nP1: FYX\/FGC P2: FXS\n0521807085c01.xml CUUK358B-Corbett December 17, 2005 15:4\n18 1 introduct ion\nC-11: target agrees with a single controller > agrees with more than one\ncontroller\nCanonically, a target has a single controller, as in examples (1)\u2013(4). Sometimes\nthe target may mark agreement more than once, in fact it may mark it up to\nfour times as we shall see in \u00a73.2.4. What is less canonical is for a single target\n(of whatever type) to agree simultaneously with more than one controller. An\nexample of this is found in associative\/possessive constructions in some Bantu\nlanguages. I shall take examples from Shona:\nShona (Welmers 1973: 178)\n(31) Imbwa na-v-ana v-a-dz-o\ndogs(9\/10) and-pl-young(1\/2) 2-associative-10-associative\n\u2018the dogs and their pups\u2019\nThe last item, the associative -a-o, has two slots for agreement, and agrees with\nboth nouns. The head noun imbwa \u2018dog(s)\u2019 belongs to gender 9\/10, it does not\nchange for number, but its plural (class 10) agreement marker is -dz-, hence \u2018dogs\u2019\nis intended. The associated noun v-ana \u2018children, young\u2019 is gender 1\/2 and takes\nthe plural (class 2) agreement marker v-.\nAnd finally, in this section on targets:\nC-12: target has no choice of controller > target has choice of controller (is\n\u2018trigger-happy\u2019)\nThis criterion is due to Comrie (2003). The idea is that in canonical agreement\na target has just one potential controller. In some less canonical instances, in\na given construction there can be different controllers (as alternatives, rather\nthan simultaneously as in the last section). Comrie gives an example from the\nNakh-Daghestanian language Tsez. The target in question is the matrix verb with\na sentential complement. Example (32) shows the expected construction. The\ncomplement is treated as the controller of agreement, and so the agreement is in\nthe default gender, gender IV (the genders are given in Roman numerals). The\nexperiencer argument, as with most verbs of this type, stands in the dative, hence\neni-r \u2018mother-dat\u2019. (Following Polinsky & Comrie, for clarity the embedded\ncomplement is given in square brackets.)\nTsez (Polinsky & Comrie 1999: 116\u2013117, Comrie 2003)\n(32) eni-r [uz\u02c7-a\u00af magalu b-a\u00afc\u2019-ru-l\u0001i]\nMother(ii)-dat boy(i)-erg bread(iii)[abs] iii-eat-pst ptcp-nmlz[abs]\nr-iy-xo.\nIV-know-prs\n\u2018The mother knows that the boy ate the bread.\u2019\nRemarkably, however, in Tsez a matrix verb can instead agree with a nominal\nin the absolutive, which is inside the complement. In (33) the matrix verb has\ngender III agreement, marking agreement with magalu \u2018bread\u2019, an absolutive\nphrase which is within the sentential complement:\nP1: FYX\/FGC P2: FXS\n0521807085c01.xml CUUK358B-Corbett December 17, 2005 15:4\n1.4 Canonical agreement 19\n(33) eni-r [uz\u02c7-a\u00af magalu b-a\u00afc\u2019-ru-l\u0001i]\nMother(ii)-dat boy(i)-erg bread(iii)[abs] iii-eat-pst ptcp-nmlz[abs]\nb-iy-xo.\niii-know-prs\n\u2018The mother knows that the boy ate the bread.\u2019\nWe return to this interesting construction in \u00a72.4.7, and for the conditions on its\nuse in \u00a76.7.1. For now the important point is that, rather than having a single\npossible controller, the matrix verb has two potential controllers (or triggers) and\nso is \u2018trigger-happy\u2019. Another example is Skou (Donohue 2003a: 486\u20137) where\nsome verbs (which in any case agree with the subject) may additionally show\nfurther agreement marking for the subject or agree with the object (according to\nthe feature values of the subject and object).\nC-13: target\u2019s part of speech is irrelevant > is relevant (given the domain)\nThe intuition here is that it is more canonical to be able to specify targets at a\nhigh level, as a general part of a domain, rather than having to make additional\nstipulations for subtypes. Thus we treat it as canonical to specify, for instance, that\nattributive modifiers agree with their head noun. Thus when we discussed Swahili\n(28), we noted that attributive adjective and numeral both agreed. Being able to\ngive a rule for attributive modifiers in general is a more canonical situation than\nthat in a language like English where one would have to specify that certain types\nof attributive modifier agree while some do not (we shall meet the particularly\nnon-canonical situation in Michif in \u00a79.1.2). Criterion 13 differs from criterion 9\n(productive marking of agreement is more canonical than sporadic marking) in\nthat the latter operates within a part of speech (do all adjectives behave alike?),\nwhile the current criterion compares across parts of speech (do all targets of a\nparticular type behave alike, irrespective of part of speech?). Criterion 13 for\ntargets mirrors criterion 4 for controllers.\n1.4.3 Domains \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\nThere are few criteria concerning domains, but they are substantial.\nWe consider these criteria here, then in \u00a72.3 we return to domains in more detail,\njustifying the need for domains in addition to controllers and targets, and inves-\ntigating their variety.\nC-14: asymmetric > symmetric\nThe use of the terms \u2018controller\u2019 and \u2018target\u2019, and indeed the arrow in Figure 1.1,\nimply that agreement is an asymmetric relation. We might treat this as a defining\ncharacteristic, or we may see it as a property of canonical agreement. If two items\nmatch for the same external reason, this is not canonical agreement. If one stands\nin a particular form because of the properties of the first, then this is potentially\ncanonical agreement. An analogy may be helpful. If houses numbered 10 and 12\nP1: FYX\/FGC P2: FXS\n0521807085c01.xml CUUK358B-Corbett December 17, 2005 15:4\n20 1 introduct ion\nare both white because it has snowed on both, this is not canonical agreement. If\nMrs White paints number 10 white and Mrs Green in number 12 paints her house\nwhite too, that is, potentially, canonical agreement.\nSeeing agreement as an asymmetric relation fits well with the idea that agree-\nment is essentially a matter of \u2018displaced\u2019 information. The logical asymmetry is\nseen in two interrelated ways. First, the controller may have no choice of feature\nvalue, while the target does, as in these examples:\nRussian\n(34) nov-yj avtomobil\u00b4\nnew-m.sg car(m)[sg]\n\u2018a new car\u2019\n(35) nov-aja mas\u02c7in-a\nnew-f.sg car(f)-sg\n\u2018a new car\u2019\n(36) nov-oe taksi\nnew-n.sg taxi(n)20\n\u2018a new taxi\u2019\nHere we have an adjective agreeing with the head noun in gender. The adjective\nhas different morphological forms available to match the gender of the noun, while\nthe noun does not accommodate the adjective in any comparable way. Logically,\nthen, the relation is asymmetric, with the adjective being controlled by the noun.\nExamples of the verb agreeing in person with the pronoun would make the point\nequally well.\nThe second part of the logical asymmetry of agreement concerns the contribu-\ntion of the agreement features to semantic interpretation. In examples (34)\u2013(36)\ngender is not based on semantics but depends on assignment based on form\n(\u00a74.3.1). If, however, in place of avtomobil\u00b4\u2018car\u2019 and mas\u02c7ina \u2018car\u2019 we have byk\n\u2018bull\u2019 and korova \u2018cow\u2019, then we have semantically based gender. Yet the gender\nmarking on the adjective does not affect the interpretation of nov- \u2018new\u2019. The\ncontribution to semantic interpretation is related to the controller rather than to\nthe target. Again this points to the asymmetry of the agreement relation (see also\nNichols 1985, 1986).\nThis is a logical asymmetry, which does not determine how the relation should\nbe modelled. There have been different means for doing so. Formerly the asym-\nmetry was handled directly by copying, but there are serious problems with that\napproach: the controller may be absent (as in pro-drop languages, example (19));\nor it may be present but be underspecified, as in (21); or the feature specifications\non the controller and the target may simply not match, as we shall see in \u00a71.4.4.\nMore modern approaches are based on unification, which does not capture the\nasymmetry directly, and so leads to the question of how it is to be captured. We\ndiscuss this important issue in \u00a74.1.\n20 This noun is indeclinable and so does not mark number (see \u00a75.1.1).\nP1: FYX\/FGC P2: FXS\n0521807085c01.xml CUUK358B-Corbett December 17, 2005 15:4\n1.4 Canonical agreement 21\nIf we accept that agreement is canonically an asymmetric relation, that leads to\nthe problem of agreement in case. For linguists who have a view of syntax which\nis based on the notion of constituency, the traditional instances of \u2018agreement in\ncase\u2019 are not agreement: matching of case values within the noun phrase results\nfrom government of the whole noun phrase by an external governor (see (13)). For\nthose who accept a dependency view of syntax, the opposite conclusion follows,\nnamely that there is agreement in case. I conclude that canonical agreement\nis asymmetric. Which instances count as asymmetric, and therefore potentially\ncanonical, depends on other assumptions about syntax. We consider the agreement\nfeatures in chapter 4, and we look specifically at the question of agreement in\ncase in \u00a74.4.1.\nC-15: local domain > non-local domain\nThis criterion implies that the \u2018smaller\u2019 the domain the more canonical it is.\nThat is, the smaller the structural distance between controller and target the more\ncanonical is the instance of agreement. The most canonical is agreement within\nthe phrase, as in examples like these books, and in (14)\u2013(17); some would call\nthis \u2018concord\u2019 (\u00a71.3.1). Less canonical would be agreement beyond the phrase but\nwithin the clause, as in Mary sings, showing agreement of the verb with one of its\narguments. Then we have agreement beyond the clause but within the sentence;\nthis would be agreement of the relative pronoun with its antecedent (which we\nmeet in \u00a72.2.2). Finally we have the more controversial domain which goes poten-\ntially beyond the sentence, namely agreement of the anaphoric (personal) pronoun\nwith its antecedent, as in Mary sings because she is happy.\nThe question as to whether agreement is only a local phenomenon is rarely\nasked. Opposing views are stated, almost as facts, with little discussion. There\nis a divide here, though by no means an absolute one, between those who have\ntreated agreement as a prime focus of study as opposed to those who come to it as\none of a set of syntactic phenomena to be accounted for. The former, for instance\nMoravcsik (1978: 334) and Lehmann (1982: 211), typically assume that the fea-\nture values of anaphoric pronouns are determined by agreement mechanisms.\nThey cite examples of anaphoric pronouns within the discussion of agreement.\nOn the other side, those who come to agreement as just one syntactic phenomenon\nof many often assume that it is a local phenomenon, and so exclude examples\nlike (Mary . . . she). This is a convenient delineation for syntax, but we shall see\nevidence to question it. The only extended discussion of the issue of which I am\naware is found in Barlow (1991, 1992: 134\u201352), who concludes that there are\nno good grounds for distinguishing between agreement and antecedent-anaphor\nrelations. Agreement cannot be restricted only to local domains. This conclusion\nis confirmed in Siewierska (1999: 225).21\nThere are two main types of evidence supporting this conclusion: the type of\nfeatures involved, and the distribution of syntactic and semantic agreement. The\n21 For the agreeing pronouns of Fula, which show special patterns, see Culy (1996).\nP1: FYX\/FGC P2: FXS\n0521807085c01.xml CUUK358B-Corbett December 17, 2005 15:4\n22 1 introduct ion\nsimple argument is that canonical agreement and antecedent-anaphor relations are\noften based on the same features. This can be illustrated from a Russian example,\nfrom the transcript of a conversation:\nRussian (Zemskaja & Kapanadze 1978: 242)\n(37) Mama a c\u02c7ajnik kipjac\u02c7en-yj?\nMummy particle kettle(m)[sg] boiled.pst.ptcp.pass-m.sg\n\u2018Mummy has the kettle boiled?\u2019\nDa-a. On uz\u02c7e naverno c\u02c7as sto-it.\nYes. 3[m.sg.nom] already probably hour stand-3sg\n\u2018Yes. It\u2019s probably been standing for an hour.\u2019\nThe anaphoric pronoun on is masculine singular, because those are the feature\nvalues of its antecedent c\u02c7ajnik \u2018kettle\u2019. Here the participle kipjac\u02c7enyj \u2018boiled\u2019,\nlike an adjective, distinguishes number (two values) and gender (three values:\nmasculine, feminine and neuter, but only in the singular). The anaphoric pronoun\ndoes the same. It is not always the case, cross-linguistically, but it is extremely\ncommon that the anaphoric pronoun has the same feature possibilities as other\nagreement targets. If agreement and antecedent-anaphor relations are split, then\nthere are two distinct phenomena which for no principled reason utilize identical\nfeatures.\nThe second argument must wait until additional concepts have been introduced,\nso we will only preview it here. The four domains mentioned above constitute\nthe Agreement Hierarchy, which will be discussed extensively in chapter 7. The\nhierarchy constrains the distribution of syntactic and semantic agreement. This\ndistribution is a gradient phenomenon, across the range of domains. Evidence\nfrom the Agreement Hierarchy shows that there is no one point at which agreement\nphenomena can be neatly divided into two in a principled way. Rather there are\nseveral different domains for agreement, related in hierarchical fashion.\nAnticipating the discussion in \u00a72.2.2 and \u00a77.6.1, I conclude that agreement\ncovers feature covariance in a range of domains, from within the noun phrase to\nantecedent-anaphor relations. This is accepted in Head-Driven Phrase Structure\nGrammar, HPSG (Pollard & Sag 1994: 74), and in Lexical-Functional Grammar,\nLFG (Bresnan 2001a: 151). And as we shall see in \u00a79.4.6, there is some psy-\ncholinguistic evidence to support this conclusion. Others limit agreement, more\nor less drastically. If we are to draw a boundary, then we need to be clear whether\nthis is based on evidence from agreement itself (which would be hard to justify),\nor whether the boundary is being drawn as a result of other considerations within\nthe syntactic model adopted. If such a boundary is proposed, then we should ask\nwhether it claims to handle the distribution of syntactic versus semantic agree-\nment (again such a claim seems unlikely to be well founded). However, even if\none excludes antecedent-anaphor relations as part of agreement, this is likely to be\nbecause they are not local links, thus taking my criterion 15 as categorical rather\nthan gradient. Within the domains there are other sources of considerable vari-\nety. We discuss these in \u00a72.3; the interesting issue of \u2018long-distance\u2019 agreement\nP1: FYX\/FGC P2: FXS\n0521807085c01.xml CUUK358B-Corbett December 17, 2005 15:4\n1.4 Canonical agreement 23\n(a term suggesting that controller and target are more distant syntactically than\nwe would expect) will be taken up in \u00a72.4.7.\nIf we accept anaphoric pronouns as agreement targets, treating antecedent-\nanaphor as a domain, it is worth noting that an anaphoric pronoun is a pronoun\nwhich also agrees. Since I am using my criteria to separate out overlapping factors,\nI have concentrated in this section on the syntactic position of such pronouns.\nHowever, their morphology can also vary, and in part independently of their\nsyntax. Thus anaphoric pronouns can be morphologically free or bound, the latter\noften being termed \u2018pronominal affixes\u2019 or \u2018incorporated pronouns\u2019 (discussed\nin \u00a73.8). Pronominal affixes are less canonical in terms of their domain than, say,\nsubject-verb agreement, since they are part of a non-local domain; on the other\nhand, they are more canonical than free pronouns in being morphologically bound.\nIt is generally accepted that diachronically pronouns provide a major source of\nagreement morphology, progressing from full pronouns, to clitics, to inflections,\nas we shall see in \u00a79.1.\nFinally in this section on domains we shift from looking at individual relations\nto looking at the system, hence our last criterion is couched in terms of a given\ndomain (and its being one of several).\nC-16: domain is one of a set > single domain\nIn canonical instances, a given domain will be a member of a set of domains (agree-\nment with a given controller may be expressed by different targets), following a\ngeneral rather than a specific syntactic rule. Thus if we take Russian subject-verb\nagreement, this is one domain of several (attributive modifier agreeing with head\nnoun, relative with antecedent . . .). This is a more canonical situation than that\nin a language where, say, subject-verb is the only agreement domain.\nThis criterion links back to the notion of redundancy: information concerning\na given controller can be expressed more than once in different domains. An\ninteresting implication related to this criterion is that multiple domains may well\nbe a sufficient but not necessary condition for showing that particular markers\nare agreement markers rather than pronominal affixes (incorporated pronouns).\nWhere different targets can show what is claimed to be agreement with a single\ncontroller, it is much more likely that these are instances of agreement rather than\nbeing pronominal affixes (\u00a73.8.2).\n1.4.4 Features \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\nHere we find three criteria, one relating to features as a whole, and\ntwo relating to their values. Features are discussed in detail in chapter 4.\nC-17: feature is lexical > non-lexical\nAgreement in gender (where lexical) is considered the canonical type (see further\n\u00a74.2.3, where I show that lexical features are the core of the \u2018inherent\u2019 features).\nThe reason is that the target could not be marked with the feature independently,\nP1: FYX\/FGC P2: FXS\n0521807085c01.xml CUUK358B-Corbett December 17, 2005 15:4\n24 1 introduct ion\nif it is lexical, and so this links to the asymmetry of agreement. Thus in (34)\u2013(36)\nthere is no independent source of the gender feature apart from the controller.\nAnother way of stating this criterion is that features which are based at least in\npart on formal assignment are more canonical for agreement than features where\nassignment is more semantically based (\u00a74.3.1) This criterion therefore falls under\nthe principle of redundancy.\nAn interesting consequence concerns anaphoric pronouns; the fact that in many\nlanguages these can covary according to lexical gender strongly suggests they are\npart of the phenomenon of agreement, as discussed in relation to (37).\nC-18: features have matching values > non-matching values\nThis seems obvious: some would claim that the definition of agreement must\nrefer to the matching of values (\u00a71.3). However, once a construction is identified\nas involving agreement, because there is a covariance of features, we would\nnot want to rule out the analogous instances where the features do not match.22\nSpecifically, since English subject and predicate verb regularly have matching\nfeatures, we have to address examples like this one where they do not:\n(38) the committee have decided\nWe cannot simply say that committee is plural, since we find this committee and\nnot *these committee. We need to invoke a notion of semantic agreement for such\ncases, that is, agreement consistent with the meaning of the controller (discussed\nin detail in \u00a75.4). From this point of view, we can say that examples like (38) are\nless canonical instances of agreement than those where the feature values match\nstraightforwardly (the committee has decided); for further discussion see Corbett\n(2000: 188\u201391). Mismatches are analysed in chapters 5 and 7.\nIf we accept that semantic agreement is non-canonical, then we should include\nhere instances of resolution, which specifies the feature values of targets when\nthe controller consists of conjoined noun phrases. Consider this example from\nSlovene (Priestly 1993: 433):\nSlovene (Priestly 1993: 433)\n(39) Milk-a in njen-o tele sta bi-l-a zunaj\nMilka(f)-sg and her-n.sg calf(n)[sg] aux.3du be-pst-m.du outside\n\u2018Milka and her calf were outside.\u2019\nHere we have a feminine singular and a neuter singular conjoined; the verb is\ndual and masculine. Clearly, then, the features do not match. It is resolution which\nspecifies these particular feature values (as we shall see in chapter 8). The fact that\nsuch instances are taken to be non-canonical fits with \u00a78.6, where the peripheral\nnature of resolution rules is discussed.\nThe general effect of this criterion is to claim that syntactic (formal) agree-\nment is more canonical than semantic agreement. An interesting consequence is\n22 Mel\u00b4 c\u02c7uk (1993: 329\u201331) stresses that the definition of agreement must allow for such instances;\nin Steele\u2019s definition this is covered by the reference to a semantic property of the controller.\nP1: FYX\/FGC P2: FXS\n0521807085c01.xml CUUK358B-Corbett December 17, 2005 15:4\n1.4 Canonical agreement 25\nthat unification is an adequate mechanism for formalizing canonical instances of\nagreement (discussed further in \u00a74.1). This consequence demonstrates well that\ncriterion 18 falls under the principle of syntactic simplicity. The criterion is also\nconsonant with the \u2018redundancy\u2019 principle.\nNon-matching values can arise in various circumstances, from those which\ncan be related directly to the lexical item (as in (38)), through those involving a\nconstruction (39), to those which depend on the use of the item, the pragmatics (as\nin (11)). There are systems in which mismatching is widespread, systems which\nBickel (2000) calls \u2018associative\u2019, which are less canonical than the more familiar\n\u2018integrative\u2019 systems (of languages like Russian). We return to mismatches in\nchapter 5.\nC-19: no choice of feature value > choice of value\nIn sentences such as the following, English allows no choice of form:\n(40) The five applicants arrive tomorrow.\nSimilarly in Hungarian predicate agreement with numeral phrases does not allow\nan option. The form, however, differs from that of English:\nHungarian (Edith Moravcsik, personal communication)\n(41) hat fiu\u00b4 e\u00b4rkez-ett\nsix boy[sg] Arrive-pst[3sg]\n\u2018six boys have arrived\u2019\nThe plural of fiu\u00b4 \u2018boy\u2019 is fiu\u00b4k, and the plural of e\u00b4rkezett \u2018arrived\u2019 is e\u00b4rkeztek;\nneither would be used in (41).23\nIn Russian, the situation is more complex. Let us take just one type: these\nRussian examples are both fully acceptable:\nRussian\n(42) vos\u02c7-l-o pjat\u00b4 devus\u02c7ek\ncome.in-pst-n.sg five[nom] girl[pl.gen]\n\u2018five girls came in\u2019\n(43) vos\u02c7-l-i pjat\u00b4 devus\u02c7ek\ncome.in-pst-pl five[nom] girl[pl.gen]\n\u2018five girls came in\u2019\nThe essential point here is that, given the same controller, target, domain and\nfeature specification of the controller, there remains a choice of agreement. Taking\na set of the quantifiers, I counted all relevant examples in a corpus of texts from\nthe nineteenth and twentieth centuries (details in Corbett 1983: 150\u20133) and found\n235 relevant examples, of which 54% showed singular agreement as in (42) and\n46% showed plural agreement as in (43). (We return to conditions on the choice\n23 Amharic combines the possibilities of English and Hungarian. In construction with a quantifier, a\nnoun may be singular or plural. If the noun phrase is subject, the verb then agrees, being singular\nif the noun is singular, and plural if it is plural (Leslau 1995: 179\u201380).\nP1: FYX\/FGC P2: FXS\n0521807085c01.xml CUUK358B-Corbett December 17, 2005 15:4\n26 1 introduct ion\nin \u00a71.4.5.) Therefore the situation found in English and Hungarian (no choice of\nfeature value) is more canonical than that found in Russian (choice of value).\nThis criterion links to the last, but is distinct from it. While choices typically\ninvolve semantic agreement in one option, semantic agreement may or may not\ninvolve an agreement choice for a particular target. For instance, in the example\n(44) this man and woman have travelled all day to meet you\nThe use of have, the result of number resolution, is an instance of semantic\nagreement, but is obligatory (at least for some speakers).\nWhile many accounts ignore them, agreement choices are rampant. In \u00a75.5 I\ninvestigate the factors which can give rise to them. As we shall see in chapter 7,\nhowever, while choices are frequent, the variation we find is far from random.\n1.4.5 Conditions \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\nHere the criterion is straightforward and intuitive:\nC-20: no conditions > conditions\nThat is to say, in the canonical situation, when the controller, target, domain\nand features have been specified for a particular agreement construction, that\nconstitutes a full specification. If we need in addition to specify a condition,\nthat is less canonical. For example, we noted the agreement choice in examples\n(42) and (43) above. There is good evidence that controllers denoting animates\nin such constructions are more likely to take agreement forms with a greater\ndegree of semantic justification (plural here) than are those referring to inanimates.\nSimilarly, controllers which precede their targets are more likely to take agreement\nforms with a greater degree of semantic justification than are those which follow.\nChapter 6 is devoted to conditions on agreement and so I can be brief here.\nWe should note, however, that agreement conditions are particularly prevalent\nwhen agreement is non-canonical in some other way. In the Russian examples the\ncondition interacts with an agreement choice, itself a non-canonical characteristic.\n1.4.6 Three general principles \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\nThree general principles were introduced earlier, and deserve brief\ndiscussion here. It is important to note that they never conflict; on the contrary,\nlike all the criteria which they cover, they converge on the notion \u2018canonical agree-\nment\u2019. We have no need to rank them nor to specify what happens in situations\nof conflict, because the criteria are mutually compatible.24\nPrinciple I: Canonical agreement is redundant rather than informative\n24 Canonical is thus a more abstract notion than prototypical; canonical can be clearly defined, but\nin principle there need not be a real instance, only approximations, while prototypical implies\nreal instances.\nP1: FYX\/FGC P2: FXS\n0521807085c01.xml CUUK358B-Corbett December 17, 2005 15:4\n1.5 Scope and structure of the book 27\nSeveral separate criteria (numbers 1, 2, 10, 17, 18 and 19, and secondarily number\n16) converge on this principle. It may be that it is this principle which leads to\ncanonical agreement being relatively rare among the world\u2019s languages.\nAs a partial restating of this principle, we might add that the greater the reliance\non formal properties the more canonical the agreement. This view of it is best\nseen by imagining its opposite. If we had fully semantic agreement, then it would\nhardly exist as a distinct phenomenon, since all the forms could be predicted\ndirectly from semantics; the matching effect would arise from controller and\ntarget corresponding simply by virtue of having a common semantic source. It is\nin the converse cases, for example in agreement in gender in instances where the\ngender is not assigned by a semantic rule, that we most evidently require special\nrules of agreement.\nPrinciple II: Canonical agreement is syntactically simple\nThis principle is that canonical agreement can be described in straightforward\nrules, while non-canonical instances typically involve an additional complication.\nIt is a generalization of criteria numbers 3, 4, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19,\n20 and partially of number 6. It is reflected in criteria relating to each aspect of\nagreement (controller, target and so on).\nPrinciple III: The closer the expression of agreement is to canonical\n(i.e. affixal) inflectional morphology, the more canonical it is\nas agreement.\nDifferent criteria converge on this principle, namely numbers 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.\nNote that they all relate to the target. There are different views as to which target\ntypes are legitimately considered to be a part of agreement, but no-one, I think,\nwould exclude the type of targets with canonical inflectional morphology from an\naccount of agreement. The criteria which fall under this principle have application\nbeyond agreement, in that they are part of a typology of inflectional morphology,\nbased on canonicity.\nI wished to clarify some of the conceptual problems and misunderstandings\nthat characterize this area. We have seen how different properties cluster, which\nmakes it particularly important that we specify which properties are the basis for\nour analytical decisions. Seeing the gradient nature of many of the properties (as\nwell as the ways in which they overlap), makes the question of \u2018drawing the line\u2019\nbetween agreement and other phenomena appear secondary. It is more important\nto understand agreement and its related phenomena than to draw a precise line at\nwhich we might claim agreement \u2018stops\u2019 and some other phenomenon begins.\n1.5 Scope and structure of the book\nGiven the importance of the topic and its diversity across languages\nthe book could have run to many volumes. It could have been filled with details\nP1: FYX\/FGC P2: FXS\n0521807085c01.xml CUUK358B-Corbett December 17, 2005 15:4\n28 1 introduct ion\nof different theories of syntax and how they fail to cover the data presented by\nagreement. However, that would not be a fruitful approach. In the early days of\ngenerative grammar agreement was used as a convenient test for investigating\napparently more complex problems (e.g. verb agreement was a test for sub-\njecthood, which allowed us to work on subject raising). Then various papers\n(including Morgan 1972, Corbett 1979) showed that agreement was itself much\ntoo poorly understood for it to be treated as an easy diagnostic. Now the wheel\nhas turned, and it is rather agreement which is a major test of our theories of\nsyntax. So I aim to present the agreement data in a clear and where possible neu-\ntral way, so that the established patterns of agreement can serve as a measure for\ntheory-building.\nThe problems with terms go deeper than many realize. For this reason my\n\u2018canonical\u2019 approach is valuable. Individual readers may wish to exclude cer-\ntain phenomena, but the position of what is being presented within the overall\nconceptual space should be clear, so that readers can include it as relevant or not.\nI am tackling an area that for some would be up to three areas. There is agree-\nment within noun phrases, which we have seen is the most canonical. For some,\nagreement in person is the major type, where the domain is the clause. Some work\nexclusively on this type of agreement, and ignore the others. And then there is\nthe question of pronouns, which are assumed to be part of the area by some and\nare excluded by others. I shall discuss these issues carefully; we shall see that\nthese three parts of the problem are linked in interesting ways, and that it makes\nsense to treat them together, rather than trying to draw unmotivated boundaries\nbetween them.\nThere are various areas involving some notion of identity which have been\nassociated with agreement. Though I have taken a broad approach, I still need\nto exclude some phenomena which show only superficial resemblances to agree-\nment. I list these here.\nSwitch reference is distantly related to agreement. It involves indicating (usu-\nally by morphological marking on the verb) whether the subject stays constant\nor switches from one clause to the next. This can be illustrated from Haruai,\na Papuan language of the Piawi family, spoken in the south-west of Madang\nprovince, Papua New Guinea:\nHaruai (Comrie 1989a: 41)\n(45) Ha do\u00a8yw nwgw-o\u00a8n, bo\u00a8r dw-a.\nchild rat see-s sbj run go.prs.3sg-dec\n\u2018The child saw the rat and he ran away.\u2019\n(46) Ha do\u00a8yw nwgw-mo\u00a8n, bo\u00a8r dw-a.\nchild rat see-d sbj run go. prs.3sg-dec\n\u2018The child saw the rat and it ran away.\u2019\nIn (45) the same subject (s sbj) marker -o\u00a8n on the dependent verb tells us that\nthe clauses must have coreferential subjects. The subject of the dependent clause\nis \u2018child\u2019, so the other clause will have the same subject, therefore it is the child\nP1: FYX\/FGC P2: FXS\n0521807085c01.xml CUUK358B-Corbett December 17, 2005 15:4\n1.5 Scope and structure of the book 29\nwho ran away. In (46) on the other hand, we know that the subject of the clause\n\u2018ran away\u2019 cannot be \u2018the child\u2019. The likely interpretation is that \u2018the rat\u2019 ran\naway, since this is an available referent, but it is possible that there could be some\nother subject (provided it were third person and singular). This is not agreement\nbecause we do not find the \u2018systematic covariance\u2019 of features required by the\ndefinition. Agreement and switch reference are connected in that both contribute\ntowards reference tracking (\u00a79.2).\nNegative concord is seen in examples of this type:\nFrench\n(47) Personne n\u2019=est venu\nnobody neg=aux.3sg come.pst.ptcp\n\u2018Nobody came.\u2019\nNegative concord shares with agreement the repetition of information, in that\nthe negative markers (personne and n(e)) express a single negation. However,\nthere is no \u2018systematic covariance\u2019, no range of features available to controller\nand target. Rather the controller is there or not, and when it is there, it requires\nthe presence of the second negation marker.25 \u2018Concord\u2019 is a good term for such\ninstances (which is another reason to avoid its use for agreement). A somewhat\nanalogous phenomenon is so-called \u2018agreement in voice\u2019 in Maori, where some\nmanner particles take passive morphology when the verb does (Bauer 1993: 92,\n478\u20139). Again this is a matter of the presence of a controller of the phenomenon,\nnot an instance of systematic covariance.\nPreposition doubling can be illustrated from some varieties of Russian, as in\nthis example:\nRussian (some varieties; Turgenev, Stuk . . . stuk . . . stuk!.. \u2018Knock . . . knock . . . knock!\u2019\nXIV, 1870)\n(48) ot e`t-oj ot sam-oj ot barys\u02c7n-i\nfrom this-f.sg.gen from very-f.sg.gen from lady(f)-sg.gen\n\u2018from this very lady\u2019\nHere we see the preposition occurring before each element of the noun phrase.\nThere is no \u2018systematic covariance\u2019 here, but simple repetition of a particular\nclass of items.\nClassifiers are of several types. Typically they involve a set, sometimes quite\nlarge, of semantically general elements which serve to classify the full range of\npossible referents. Thus even in English we have expressions like: forty head of\ncattle, where head is used for various livestock but not for other items. This is not\nagreement, since we have to do with selection of a lexical item, not systematic\ncovariance. However, where the classifier is repeated (as in (24) above), this is\narguably non-canonical agreement, or at least a possible source of agreement.\nSequence of tenses, as found in English, is sometimes annexed to agreement.\nHowever, this is hardly justified. Consider this example:\n25 I am grateful to Richard Ingham for discussion of negative concord.\nP1: FYX\/FGC P2: FXS\n0521807085c01.xml CUUK358B-Corbett December 17, 2005 15:4\n30 1 introduct ion\n(49) Mary said that John had come. (Mary said: \u2018John has come\u2019.)\nThere is no matching of tenses; rather the tense in the subordinate clause is shifted\nback to the pluperfect, and this shift is determined by the past tense in the main\nclause.\nIf we view syntax abstractly enough, a great deal of it is to do with required\nidentities. Agreement is the central instance of identities, and there are numerous\nanalogies to more distant phenomena. It therefore proves a good entry point to\nmuch of what syntax is about.\n1.5.1 Outline of the book \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\nHaving set out the five components we need in order to describe\nagreement (Figure 1.1), we can explore each in turn. In chapter 2 we inves-\ntigate the diversity of controllers, targets and domains. At this point issues\nabout the realization of agreement become pressing, and so chapter 3 is devoted to\nthe morphology of agreement. We then return to agreement features in chapter 4.\nThis naturally brings us to the challenge of the instances where feature values do\nnot match, which we address in chapter 5. We then have all the necessary material\nin place to tackle the remaining component, namely conditions, in chapter 6. We\nnext look in detail at constructions in which there is a choice of agreements (chap-\nter 7). Chapter 8 is devoted to the specific, but very interesting issue of resolution.\nAnd finally in chapter 9 we look at other perspectives on agreement. Each chapter\nbuilds on what has gone before. However, to help readers who prefer to begin in\nthe middle, there is a good deal of cross-referencing.\n1.5.2 Key languages \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\nI shall draw data from a wide range of interesting languages. However,\nfor continuity, three will play a special role. Russian is a member of the Slavonic\nfamily, which is a relatively conservative branch of Indo-European. It has substan-\ntial inflectional morphology of a fusional nature. Case is marked on noun phrases,\nwhere there is agreement in gender (masculine, feminine and neuter) and number\n(singular and plural), and verbs agree with subject noun phrases; the language is\nclearly of the nominative-accusative type. Within the noun phrase word order is\nrelatively fixed, with determiners and attributive adjectives normally preceding\nthe noun, and modifying phrases following. Discontinuity of elements is possible\n(as in (12)), with varying degrees of stylistic effect. On the other hand, order\nwithin the clause is relatively free, in that it is sensitive to information structure:\ngiven information typically precedes new information. Since subjects frequently\nrepresent given information, subject-verb-object emerges as the canonical word\norder. A fine overview of Russian is provided by Timberlake (1993); this is a\ngood pointer to more detailed accounts. The development of Russian over the\ntwentieth century is traced in Comrie, Stone & Polinsky (1996), and Timberlake\nP1: FYX\/FGC P2: FXS\n0521807085c01.xml CUUK358B-Corbett December 17, 2005 15:4\n1.5 Scope and structure of the book 31\n(2004) is a useful reference grammar. Russian earns its place as a language which\nfrequently shows constructions which are close to canonical. Yet it has plenty of\nsurprises too, with many choices of agreement forms and complex conditions on\nchoices.26\nTsakhur is a Nakh-Daghestanian language of the Lezgian group. Estimates\nof the number of speakers vary, with the official figure being around 30,000, in\nsouthern Daghestan and in Azerbaijan. There is considerable dialectal variation.\nThe recent substantial grammar (Kibrik 1999) is based on the language as spoken\nin Mishlesh, the largest Tsakhur settlement, with around 1,000 inhabitants.27 All\nthe examples cited in this book come from that settlement. Mishlesh is situated on\nthe River Samur, somewhat higher up the valley than the settlement of Tsakhur\nitself, at about 1,800 metres. Tsakhur is the language normally heard in Mishlesh,\nthough many people know Russian, to varying degrees, and some know other\nlanguages too, notably Azerbaijani.\nThe phonological inventory is impressive, with over 70 consonantal\nphonemes.28 The inflectional morphology is extensive, with rich verbal\nparadigms, both finite and non-finite, based on a perfective-imperfective aspectual\ndistinction, with a third stem indicating epistemic modality. There are eighteen\ncases, two numbers and four genders. Assignment to genders I and II is relatively\nstraightforward: I is for male humans (but also gods, angels and so on) while II\nis for female humans (and female mythical beings). The other two genders are\nmore difficult. Most of the remaining animates are assigned to gender III. Just a\nfew, however, are in gender IV, along with some mythical beings. And inanimates\nare found both in genders III and in gender IV.\nTsakhur has ergative syntax: subjects of transitive clauses are marked with the\nergative case; intransitive subjects and direct objects take the absolutive. The basic\nword order is subject-object-verb, as is usual for a Daghestanian language, but\nthe Tsakhur of Mishlesh shows rather free word order. Tsakhur is remarkable for\nthe sheer amount of agreement it has. As we shall see, agreement seems to appear\neverywhere we might imagine, and then in additional places too. Even among\nthe luxuriant agreement systems of Daghestanian languages, Kibrik (1999: 354)\ngives Tsakhur the top place for the variety of the agreements it displays. We shall\nalso meet some of Tsakhur\u2019s relatives, notably Archi and Tsez.\nOur third key language is Kayardild, a member of the Tangkic family,\ndescribed in Evans\u2019 (1995) extensive grammar. Kayardild is highly endangered,\nwith a handful of speakers in Queensland, Australia, in the Wellesley Islands\nand adjoining mainland. Kayardild\u2019s relatives are Lardil and Yukulta (plus the\n26 Russian orthography is largely morphophonemic and so examples will be given in the standard\nlinguistic transliteration of the orthography.\n27 I wish to thank again the people of Mishlesh for their hospitality and their help with working on\ntheir language.\n28 For transcribing Tsakhur, as in Kibrik (1999: 14\u201317, 27) the following deserve mention:\nI indicates pharyngialization; macron indicates length of vowels and intensive pronunciation of\nconsonants; for consonants: \u2019 marks ejectives, subscript j shows palatalization; G is a voiced\nuvular stop, R a voiced uvular fricative, and X an unvoiced uvular fricative.\nP1: FYX\/FGC P2: FXS\n0521807085c01.xml CUUK358B-Corbett December 17, 2005 15:4\n32 1 introduct ion\nextinct Yangkaal and Nguburindi). The Tangkic family is only distantly related to\nother Australian languages. Kayardild has a moderate phoneme inventory, with\nsix vowels and seventeen consonants; it has parallel series of stops and nasals,\neach distinguishing six points of articulation. Kayardild is a typical Australian\nlanguage in having a rich case system and very free word order. Cases can be\n\u2018stacked\u2019 to a remarkable degree. Moreover, the displacement of information on\ntense\/aspect\/mood\/polarity means that Kayardild poses a serious challenge to\ntraditional and current accounts of agreement.\nThese three languages are in many respects as different as one can imag-\nine, both in their external circumstances and in their linguistic characteristics.\nAn introduction to these three gives some sense of the scale of diversity of the\nworld\u2019s languages. By including them at strategic points I will ensure that my\nview of agreement systems is broadly based. We should not forget too that English\ncan have a useful role (Morgan & Green 2005). Its agreement system is at the\ntypological extreme, particularly in the role of semantics; it should certainly not\ndetermine our approach, but it will prove very useful as a familiar language which\nexhibits an exotic agreement system.\n1.6 Helpful background for the reader\n1.6.1 Resources \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\nThere are considerable resources available for research into agree-\nment.

More recent\ncollections are Corbett (1999a) and Brown, Corbett & Tiberius (2003). There is\nan on-line bibliography containing over 550 items (Tiberius, Corbett & Barron\n2002). Then there is a typological database, which attempts to cover agreement\nexhaustively in fifteen genetically diverse languages (Tiberius, Brown & Corbett\n2002a). This is freely available for on-line searching. It is described in Tiberius,\nBrown & Corbett (2002b), and analytical issues concerning the database are\ndiscussed in Corbett (2003b).\n1.6.2 Assumptions \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\nWhile I have gone to great lengths to make the material available to\nreaders of different persuasions, readers should be aware of my own position,\nparticularly in three key areas, so that they can adjust as necessary. The first is\nthe nature of morphology, which clouds many discussions, when linguists have\nassumptions which are often unspoken and unanalysed. I think of morphology\nin realizational terms, that is, it realizes the feature specifications determined by\nsyntax. There is therefore no need in our typology for agreement markers to be\ntreated separately from targets and the feature specifications which are realized on\nP1: FYX\/FGC P2: FXS\n0521807085c01.xml CUUK358B-Corbett December 17, 2005 15:4\n1.6 Helpful background for the reader 33\ntargets. This view is discussed in \u00a73.1. Second, as raised briefly in \u00a71.4.3, I think\nof agreement as cumulating information from different sources, not as a matter\nof copying. We return to this issue in \u00a74.1. For now we should bear in mind that\na good deal has been written with the assumption that agreement is copying, and\nmuch of this (particularly writings on phenomena which were claimed not to be\nagreement) is rendered somewhat unconvincing once the alternative perspective\nof cumulation becomes available. And third, I take a canonical view, believing\nthat there are clearer and less clear instances of agreement, and that in some areas\nit may not be productive to draw definitional lines; rather we need to see how the\nphenomena are related. This issue has been aired in the current chapter, and will\ninform the rest of the book.\n1.6.3 Conventions \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\nFor presenting examples the Leipzig Glossing Rules are adopted (for\ndetails see http:\/\/www.eva.mpg.de\/lingua\/index.html). The essentials have prob-\nably been absorbed from the examples already given. Where the material can be\nsegmented morphologically, this is done with \u2018-\u2019 in the example and in the gloss\n(thus \u2018cat-s\u2019 is glossed as \u2018cat-pl\u2019). There is a standard set of abbreviations (for\nitems such as \u2018sg\u2019), which promise to save linguists time as they are adopted more\ngenerally. Those used in this book, including necessary additions not in the list,\nare given on pages xvi\u2013xviii. Where there is a many-to-one relationship, as in\nwere indicating both past and plural, this is normally indicated with a stop, thus\n\u2018be.pst.pl\u2019 (but person and number are not separated in this way in the rules). For\nus it will be important that non-overt elements are indicated with \u2018[ ]\u2019, thus \u2018cat\u2019\ncan be glossed \u2018cat[sg],\u2019 and inherent non-overt features are given in \u2018( )\u2019, notably\nfor the gender of nouns (\u00a74.2.3). Explanations will be deliberately repeated when\nthe key point of the example might otherwise be lost.\nGlossing is always a compromise, since more and more information may be\nadded, but this may obscure the point at issue.29 For agreement, features are of\nkey importance and all necessary detail will be given for them. Occasionally I\nshall simplify glosses in otherwise complex examples. Glossing is sometimes\nuncomfortable, because of the need to segment linguistic material and to assign\ninformation to particular segments. This segmentation is only to help the reader;\nit is not an issue in a realizational approach to morphology (\u00a71.6.2, \u00a73.1). Bold\nface may be used in examples, particularly complex ones, to draw attention to the\nrelevant part; it has no linguistic significance.\nThe glosses are morphosyntactic, in the sense that syncretisms (morphological\nambiguities) are normally resolved in the gloss in the light of the syntactic con-\ntext. Thus in the example they have decided, the verb have will be glossed as third\n29 I note from the Leipzig Glossing Rules: \u2018Glosses are part of the analysis, not part of the data.\nWhen citing an example from a published source, the gloss may be changed by the author if they\nprefer different terminology, a different style or a different analysis.\u2019\nP1: FYX\/FGC P2: FXS\n0521807085c01.xml CUUK358B-Corbett December 17, 2005 15:4\n34 1 introduct ion\nperson plural, though out of context have represents various other feature speci-\nfications. There was an instance in (12) above, where the phrase kakoj . . . sovet\n\u2018what advice\u2019 was glossed as being accusative, even though out of context the\nmorphological forms could have realized nominative case. In (12) the agreement\nof the verb unambiguously identifies subject from object, hence accusative is the\nonly appropriate gloss in context. Where such syncretisms are of relevance, they\nare discussed in the text following the example.\nWe also need a convention for presenting evidence here, since I have written\npreviously on related topics. The books on Gender (Corbett 1991) and Num-\nber (2000) had particular features as their focus, and demonstrating their nature\ndepended in part on agreement. In this book there will be occasional overlaps,\nwhere the main argument line requires it. Whenever supporting evidence from\nthose books can be referred to rather than needing to be directly cited, a reference\nacross will be given. Other papers of mine are superseded by this book, though\nthere will often be additional supporting material in the original paper.\n1.7 Conclusion\nI have mapped out the area of agreement in broad outline, and we can\nnow begin to look in more detail. As we do so, we shall examine a wider range\nof languages than is usual in discussions of agreement. For this reason it will be\nimportant to be consistent in our use of terms, and to be clear about any analytical\ndecisions. This will also make it easier to have fruitful collaboration with others\ninterested in agreement, such as psycholinguists, those in acquisition and those\nin computational linguistics.\n"}
