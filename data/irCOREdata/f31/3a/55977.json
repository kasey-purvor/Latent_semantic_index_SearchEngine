A composite of all nights\u2019 data was\nproduced using boundary layer height to normalize measured altitudes. The observations\nshowed some typical characteristics of nocturnal boundary layer development, notably a\nstrong inversion after sunset and the formation of a low-level nocturnal jet later in the night.\nOn most nights, the sampled jet did not change direction significantly during the night.\nThe boundary layer thermodynamic structure displayed some variations from one night\nto the next. This was investigated using two contrasting case studies from the period. In\none of these case studies (18 August 2005), the low level wind direction changed significantly\nduring the night. This change was captured well by two large scale models, suggesting that\nthe large scale dynamics had a significant impact on boundary layer winds on this night.\nFor both case studies, the models tended to underestimate near-surface wind speeds during\nthe night; a feature which may lead to an underestimation of moisture flux northwards by\nmodels.\n1. Introduction\nThe West African monsoon is caused by the northwards shift in the inter-tropical front\nduring northern hemisphere summer months. The shift is a result of increased heating over\nthe Sahara generating a heat low, simultaneous with cooling of the sea surface temperatures\nover the Gulf of Guinea, creating a pressure gradient between the cooler Atlantic coast of\nWest Africa and the north (Sultan and Janicot 2003). The seasonal time scale of the monsoon\n1\nis important for annual rainfall amounts, and the daily weather is influenced by the diurnal\ncycle of convection which is reliant on monsoon and African Easterly Wave (AEW) processes\nfor moisture supply.\nObservation and model studies have documented the large scale dynamics of the West\nAfrican monsoon, the formation of the African Easterly Jet and AEWs (e.g. Burpee 1972;\nThorncroft and Hoskins 1994; Berry and Thorncroft 2005). Despite these efforts there are\ncontinuing issues associated with the modeling of the monsoon and the relationship between\nthe monsoon and AEWs is still relatively unexplored. The consequence of this knowledge\ndeficit is an inaccurate representation of West African rainfall by numerical models, leading\nto poor forecast ability (Washington et al. 2006b).\nMoisture transport to northern regions of West Africa is characterised by the diurnal\ncycle of monsoon winds. This was summerized in Parker et al. (2005a): during the day\nconvection in the boundary layer imposes a drag on horizontal winds, but at night turbulence\ndecreases due to surface cooling allowing the northwards penetration of the monsoon. Hence,\nthe strongest wind speeds associated with the monsoon inflow are instigated during night\ntime (Dolman et al. 1997), and around the time of monsoon onset the nocturnal low level\nflow is primarily responsible for moisture transport to the northern Sahel (confirmed in the\nhumidity budget in Lothon et al. 2008). This emphasizes the importance of understanding\nthe nocturnal boundary layer (NBL) and gives motivation for observation studies. Improved\nunderstanding of NBL processes could also impact on the prediction of convection: for\nexample, Vila`-Guerau de Arellano (2007) found that changes in nocturnal boundary layer\nprofiles had an impact on the generation of convection during the day.\nThe monsoon moist inflow is known to slope vertically downwards with latitude and is\n2\ndriven primarily by pressure gradients (Parker et al. 2005b). In the Sahel region (13-17\u25e6N),\nthe monsoon inflow is confined to a 1-2 km layer near the surface, existing solely in the\nboundary layer (Parker et al. 2005b). The nocturnal jet at 15\u25e6N reverses direction between\nwet and dry seasons (Guichard et al. 2009) and is driven primarily by pressure gradients,\nnot sloping terrain. This latitude is therefore an ideal location for studying the NBL in\nthe context of larger scale monsoon processes. However, boundary layer observations in the\nSahel region have been limited. Poor communication facilities, socio-economic difficulties and\nenvironmental harshness have resulted in few meteorological observations available outside\nof main cities. Few night time observations exist, apart from midnight radiosoundings.\nPrevious observation campaigns have highlighted the role of the diurnal cycle on the\nWest African weather. Even early studies such as that of Hamilton and Archbold (1945)\nincluded references to the diurnal cycle of winds and convection. McGarry and Reed (1978)\nlooked at the diurnal cycle using satellite and rainfall data from the GATE field campaign\nand Culf (1992) used station and radiosonde data to look at the daytime boundary layer\nduring the SEBEX campaign (Wallace et al. 1990). More recently, the diurnal variations in\nthe low-level circulation during the Harmattan dry season were investigated in the BoDEx\nfield campaign in Chad (Washington et al. 2006a; Washington and Todd 2005). The speed\nof the low-level jet was found to peak during the night and be weakest during the day,\nin agreement with studies from other areas of the globe (for example Mahrt et al. 1979).\nSubsequent studies of the NBL (Abdou et al. 2009; Lothon et al. 2008; Pospichal et al. 2009)\nhave been conducted as part of the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis (AMMA)\nfield campaign (Redelsperger et al. 2007; Lebel et al. 2009). These papers have provided\nvaluable insights into NBL mechanisms, but the observations are sparse in number and there\n3\nhas not been a set of measurements from the northern Sahel region during the monsoon.\nThis paper presents a unique new observational dataset of the NBL in the Sahel. Tethered\nballoon soundings were conducted in August 2005 in Agoufou (15.2\u25e6N, 1.3\u25e6W), Mali, as part\nof the AMMA field campaign. The balloon recorded temperature, humidity, wind speed and\ndirection simultaneously. The Sahelian location of Agoufou is ideal for studying the diurnal\ncycle in monsoon winds.\nThe key objective of the study is to provide an overview of nocturnal boundary layer\nconditions in this rarely visited region. In addition we compare the observations to output\nfrom global forecast models.\nThe experiment results are presented in two ways: mean evolution of profiles is shown\nand the night-to-night variability is explored with more detailed analysis of two nights. The\nfield work is described in section 2 and general results are given in section 3. Section 4 looks\nat the variability in the two case study nights. Section 5 discusses the results and the impact\nthat larger scale meteorology has on the local boundary layer in the Sahel, while section 6\ncontains the final summary.\n2. Overview of experiments\na. Data collection method\nThe experiments that took place in August 2005 used a tethered balloon to profile the\nSahelian boundary layer up to 200 m. A parafoil kite was used in high winds (approximately\n10 ms\u22121) as such conditions were not suitable for balloon flight. Soundings were made\n4\napproximately every hour from sunset to dawn. The measurements were taken by a Vaisala\nTS-5A-SP Tethersonde, sampling every 1.5 seconds giving pressure, temperature and relative\nhumidity. The wind speed and direction were determined by a mounted anemometer on the\nsonde, and standard tailfins were added to give balance and align the sonde with the wind\nto monitor wind direction. The balloon was a Vaisala Tethered Balloon TTB Series, filled\nwith helium, with dimensions 3.8 m in length, 1.85 m in diameter.\nThe balloon was stopped every 10 m for 30 seconds during ascent\/descent up to 100 m\nand every 20 m above that height. This was to reduce the influence of the movement of the\nballoon from the wind readings; thus only the readings within these stops are included in\nthe results for wind. The stop duration of 30 seconds was decided upon as a compromise\nbetween allowing sufficient time for the balloon to settle, and getting as many measurements\nin the night as possible. The temperature and humidity readings were taken continually\nas the movement of the balloon has minimal effect on these. On average, each profile took\napproximately 20 minutes to complete including stops. In total 12 nights were sampled; the\nnumber of readings on each night was dependent on weather conditions.\nThe field site was located at 15.2\u25e6N, 1.3\u25e6W in a relatively flat region of grassland and\nsmall trees; the nearest farmed area was a kilometer to the north at the Agoufou village.\nFull details of the site are given in Mougin et al. (2009). The nearest significant orography\nwas the table-like structure of Mount Hombori, reaching 848 m above local ground level,\nlocated approximately 30 km to the west and surrounded by plains. The terrain of the field\nsite was slightly rolling, with maximum hill elevations of 10 m. The location was very close\nto the transition between seasonal grassland and desert.\nInformation from Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) and CESBIO automatic\n5\nweather stations were consulted. One CEH station was at Agoufou near the balloon site.\nThe second CEH station was at Edgerit (15.5\u25e6N, 1.4\u25e6W), much less vegetated than Agoufou\nwith mainly gravelly red soil and few shrubs. The Vaisala WXT510 Weather Transmit-\nter instrument was used to gain temperature and wind information. The stations were\ninstalled by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH), assisted by CESBIO\/IRD scien-\ntists from Bamako. Data from the CESBIO automatic weather station at Bamba (17.1\u25e6N,\n1.4\u25e6W, 95% sand soil, sparse vegetation) was used as the CEH station was not func-\ntioning at this time. A full list of instrumentation and specifications can be found at\nhttp:\/\/amma.mediasfrance.org\/implementation\/instruments.\nb. Numerical models\nGlobal forecast models are able to accurately simulate large scale dynamical motions\ndays in advance but are less able to capture small scale variability such as convergence and\nconvection. This is partly because of lack of resolution, lack of observations to initialize\nthe model, the model surface description, and the limits of soil, turbulent convection and\nnear-surface data assimilation and parameterizations.\nDue to their good representation of large scale flow, models can be used to some extent\nto ascertain whether the balloon measurements are representative of a larger area, creating\na context for the observations. It is also useful to compare observations to models to assess\nif current simulations of Sahelian boundary layers are accurate, and if not, what impact\nthis could have on other aspects of model representation over West Africa such as moisture\nfluxes.\n6\nThe European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) model and the\nUK Met Office Unified Model (UM, Cullen 1993) are used in section 4 for comparisons to\nobservations. The performance of these models is of interest, as both are used operationally\nand widely within the research community. Using two gives a reference to each of them, to\nascertain whether features are repeated in an alternative model.\nThe ECMWF analysis, version TL511L60 is used with a resolution of approximately 40\nkm with 60 levels in the vertical (documentation available from www.ecmwf.int\/publications).\nThe Met Office UM operational global forecast model, version 6.1, has been run in place of\nusing the analysis because of its flexibility of output time and choice of parameter output.\nThe resolution of the model is approximately 40 km meridionally, 60 km zonally at 15\u25e6N,\nwith 50 vertical levels. The UM forecasts are initialized from the UM analysis at 0000 UTC\non the day of each case study, hence comparisons at 1800 are with the 18 hour UM forecast\nand at 0600 are with the 30 hour UM forecast.\nc. Overview of the season\nThe 2005 summer monsoon season produced above-average rainfall across most of the\nSahel compared to the climatology of 1979 - 2000 (Shein 2006). This climatology does not\ntake into account the negative trend in Sahelian rainfall over the last 100 years, which,\ncontrary to the above, suggests 2005 was a below-average year for rainfall.\nThe ECMWF analysis was used to document the synoptic situation in which the ob-\nservations were taken, in order to evaluate possible larger scale influences. AEW troughs\nwere tracked using the technique outlined in Fink and Reiner (2003), where 2-6 day filtered\n7\nmeridional winds and relative vorticity above a threshold of 10\u22126 s\u22121 were used to identify\nthe position of the northern and southern troughs. The troughs were initially identified by\na hovmoeller plot, and manually tracked every 6 hours from the wind and vorticity plots.\nThe analysis suggested that seven AEWs crossed West Africa during August 2005, which\nwas also a particularly active period of hurricane activity in the Atlantic. During the bal-\nlooning period, four AEW troughs moved across, reaching the field site longitude on approx-\nimately 7, 12, 17 and 21 August.\n3. General results and generic observations of the NBL\nData were collected on twelve nights in August 2005, summarized in Table 1. Four full\nnights\u2019 worth of data were collected from 1800 UTC to approximately 0600 UTC. When a\nnight\u2019s data is referred to, it will be given the date at the beginning of the night\u2019s experiments,\nso for example the night of the 12 August will also include the morning of 13 August.\nPhysical processes in NBLs are non-linear and the information from table 1 demonstrates\nthat atmospheric conditions vary from night to night. However, there are some common\nfeatures which typify the NBL. In this section, we present a composite of many of the\nexperiments from different nights to describe the common features of the Agoufou NBL.\nThe profiles from ten nights (9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20, and 21 August) were\ngathered together to present composite plots of the changes in wind, potential temperature\nand humidity overnight in the lower boundary layer. The nights selected were used for\ntheir quality and quantity of observations. The profile altitudes were normalised against\nthe boundary layer height for each night to reduce the impact of night-to-night variability\n8\nin boundary layer vertical structure. The normalisation presented some challenge, as the\nmajority of profiles were available in the evening transition period between 1800 and 2300,\nhence boundary layer height, which is often defined by Richardson number (Garratt 1994;\nMahrt et al. 1979) was noisy due to the breakdown of the daytime boundary layer and the\nsetting up of the NBL. An alternative method of finding the boundary layer height was used\nfrom Vogelezang and Holtslag (1996).\nIn Vogelezang and Holtslag (1996) it was stated that boundary layer height, h, can be\nestimated from\nh \u2261 c\nu\u2217\nN\n(1)\nwhere u\u2217 is friction velocity, c is a constant and N is Brunt Vaisala frequency. Friction\nvelocity was obtained from the Agoufou CEH flux station, available every 30 minutes. The\nconstant c = 12, which assumes a non-neutral boundary layer (Vogelezang and Holtslag\n1996). Different values of c were tested and found to make little difference to the overall\nstructures observed in the final composite, however it should be noted that this value was\ncalculated for the Cabauw site in the Netherlands and the validity in Agoufou has not been\nverified. The Brunt Vaisala frequency, N was found by\nN2 = (g\/\u03b8s)(\u03b8h \u2212 \u03b8s)\/h. (2)\nHere \u03b8s and \u03b8h are potential temperatures at the surface and at height h, and g is\nacceleration due to gravity. Potential temperature was used rather than virtual potential\ntemperature due to missing humidity data on some nights significantly reducing the number\n9\nof points available for averaging. Using equations (1) and (2), the height of the boundary\nlayer was found when h and the sampled height, z, converge on the same value.\nBoundary layer height alters throughout the night and is very low immediately after\nsunset when the day time layer is breaking up and the NBL is not established. For this\nanalysis, boundary layer heights which decreased with time were rejected in favour of growing\nlayers. A linear fit was applied to the values of boundary layer height for each night so that\nh was varying in time. Values in the fit below 15 m were rejected and set to 15 m, and values\nin the fit above the maximum measured boundary layer height were set to this maximum\nvalue. To normalize different nights boundary layer height by a reference value, an Agoufou\n\u2018average\u2019 boundary layer height which varied in time was created. A linear fit of all data\npoints of boundary layer height was used as an approximation of average boundary layer\nheight. Figure 1 shows the position of the boundary layer height each night, along with the\nfit for \u2018average\u2019 boundary layer. Again, the average boundary layer height was set so that\nvalues less than 15 m were rejected and set to 15 m, and values in the fit above the maximum\nboundary layer height were set to the maximum recorded value. A square root fit would be\nmore ideal; however given the sparseness of data points, the linear fit is a reasonable first\napproximation.\nThe sampled altitudes were normalized by the night\u2019s boundary layer height, ht, and the\nAgoufou \u2018average\u2019 boundary layer height, Ht, at each time, t, such that new altitude for the\nprofiles was given by\nHt\nz\nht\n(3)\n10\nThe values were loaded into a grid with 30 minute, 10 m boxes and values in each box\nwere averaged. Figure 2 was produced, showing the time-normalised height plots for the\nvarious parameters using 146 profiles. The plots are smoothed using a three point running\nmean interpolation. A linear interpolation was also applied between gaps for presentation:\napproximately 25% of the plots are gap-filled. The result is a composite which shows the\nmain signal from a combination of all nights.\nFor potential temperature and wind direction, differences from the mean values of the\nprofiles before sunset (1830 UTC) were used. Using the differences removes the effect of\neach night\u2019s different initial conditions, and presents a clear evolution of the boundary layer\novernight. When the same technique was used for the wind speed and mixing ratio, the\nsignal was lost due to averaging and missing values near the beginning of the night, hence a\nsimpler averaged plot of wind speed and mixing ratio from all profiles is shown.\nIt should also be noted that the composite uses information from fewer nights in the later\npart due to data availability (see table 1 for profile times), which may lead to some biasing\nof the signal after 0200. Despite this, figure 2 can still be used to distinguish structures\nwhich are common to the Agoufou NBL, and is a useful visualisation tool if used with these\nlimitations in mind.\nPotential Temperature\nThe observations revealed some consistent structures in the NBL evolution. On most of\nthe nights the surface layers showed a defined inversion in temperature after sunset due to\nrapid cooling at the surface. This strong gradient was mixed upwards from the surface during\n11\nthe night until it escaped the vertical range of the balloon. After that time the temperature\nthroughout the sampled layer was more uniform. Throughout the night, the temperature\nat the surface continued to decrease, though in the cases where there were measurements\nfurther into the night, the nocturnal cooling rate decreased.\nMixing ratio\nMixing ratio was higher near the surface after sunset, and decreased rapidly with height\nabove H(z\/h) = 100 m. Later profiles showed a complex structure in the mixing ratio and\nfigure 2(b) shows some moistening throughout the composite NBL between midnight and\n0300 UTC.\nIt is possible that the increase in moisture in the composite is the signature of horizontal\nadvection of moister air from lower latitudes due to the monsoon inflow Lothon et al. (e.g.\n2008). It is also possible that some moistening is due to evaporation directly from the soil\npores. The drying seen after 0330 was based on fewer profiles, but coincided with faster wind\nspeeds and more mixing taking place in the early hours. A possible explanation is therefore\nthat the available moisture was mixed higher throughout the boundary layer, resulting in a\ndecrease in mixing ratio in the lower layers.\nWind speed and direction\nDuring the night a stable nocturnal layer developed from the surface. The wind speeds\nabove approximately H(z\/h) = 100 m increased rapidly once the inversion was set up, due\nto the reduction in turbulence associated with a stably stratified profile. An increase in\n12\nwind speed was recorded for all nights, with a low level jet observed on several nights above\nH(z\/h) = 150 m. The increase in speed between 150 and 200 m is consistent with similar\nobservations from semi-arid regions (Lothon et al. 2008; Mahrt et al. 1979; Washington and\nTodd 2005), which have shown jet formation taking place between 200-400 m. The higher\nwind speeds eventually led to the erosion of the inversion from above through shear-driven\nmixing.\nThere were often only very weak changes in wind direction recorded by the tethersonde\nduring the night, shown in figure 2(c), though some signal may be lost due to variability and\naveraging. The weak direction changes are in agreement with the Agoufou surface station\ndata, where the August mean directional change from evening to morning was 40 degrees, and\nnot consistently anticlockwise. Blackadar (1957), Buajitti and Blackadar (1957) and Thorpe\nand Guymer (1977) describe the inertial oscillation processes which lead to the turning\nof nocturnal jet winds with time. One full inertial oscillation at the location of Agoufou\nwould take approximately 46 hours to complete due to the low latitude. This translates an\nexpected change in wind direction of 90 degrees over the course of the night, therefore the\nobserved wind changes were less than expected. This suggests that the inertial oscilliation\nis being damped, possibly by frictional forces, advection, or more dominant ageostrophic\ncomponents (see conditions for inertial oscillation in Davis 2000) due to the low altitude of\nthe measurements.\nIn general the direction of the wind maximum for each night was from the south-west.\nThe direction of the prevailing monsoon wind at this latitude is from the south-west rather\nthan from the south due to the Coriolis effect acting on synoptic scale wind motions and the\npresence of the heat low maximum over Algeria, Northern Niger and Northern Mali.\n13\nThe wind observations showed that there were significant variations in strength from one\nnight to the next. It often appeared in the data that on the nights where there was a stronger\ninversion, faster wind speeds were recorded by the balloon.\nThe relationship between inversion and jet strength will be explored in section 4 using the\ngradient Richardson number (Ri) to analyse the tethersonde data. A large Ri due to stable\nconditions and a strong inversion, would indicate a less turbulent atmosphere, suggesting\nany jet would be more free to accelerate. Therefore on nights where Ri is higher, the wind\nspeed in the jet is expected to be faster. However, later in the night, a stronger jet would\nlead to more shear and more turbulence, reducing the value of Ri. Turbulence becomes more\nsignificant as Ri tends to 0.25 (Oke 1987), though this value may be higher, up to 1, for\nintermittent turbulence to occur (Mahrt 1999; Zilitinkevich and Baklanov 2002). Therefore\nthe turbulence generated by the jet, coupled with a mixing and erosion of the inversion\nstrength would lead to lower values of Ri later in the night. In contrast, nights when Ri\nvalues are low early on in the night, would be expected to retain relatively constant values\nthroughout.\n4. Case study nights\nThe profiles showed variability in observed features from one night to the next. Two case\nstudies have been selected to highlight the variability and to discuss possible mechanisms\nwhich account for the differences. The 11 August and 18 August were chosen because of the\nvariety in observed features between the two nights and for their quality of observations.\nTable 2 presents data from the surface stations at Agoufou, Edgerit and Bamba to provide\n14\na comparison to the balloon data and an evaluation of the main observed features. Wind\ndirection for the start of the night is an average between 2000 and 2300 to reduce the impact\nof unsteady wind changes during the nocturnal transition phase immediately after sunset.\na. Night of 11 August 2005\na. Boundary layer observations\nThe day of 11 August was one of the hotter days of the experiment period. The temper-\nature difference between day and night was large at all stations. A selection of five profiles\nfrom 11 August are shown in figure 3. Sixteen profiles were completed overall. The nocturnal\nprofiles provide a classic \u2018textbook\u2019 example of the evolution of the NBL, where the tem-\nperature, humidity and wind direction profiles are all closely interlinked, such as in Garratt\n(1994).\nFigures 3(a) and 3(d) show strong near-surface temperature and humidity inversions\npresent immediately after sunset. During the night the temperature profile below 100 m\nbecame less stable as the wind speed increased, and temperature and humidity became\nmore uniform throughout the layer.\nThe nocturnal jet formed at the top of the sampled layer, with wind speeds increasing\nsteadily above 50 m throughout the night. The measured wind speed reached a maximum\nof 12 m s\u22121 at approximately 120 m above the ground at 0300 UTC (not shown). Wind\ndirection was steadily from the south-west. The only notable large change in direction was\nclose to the surface; however this can be accounted for by the lightness of the winds causing\ninstability in the direction of the sonde.\n15\nThe plot of gradient Richardson number, figure 3(c), shows high levels of stability (high\nRi) higher up and a shallow layer near the surface where Ri was low. In general Ri decreased\nin time towards the end of the night, occurring at the same time as a decrease in the strength\nof the inversion, and an increase in wind shear with the increasing jet strength.\nTable 2 shows some of the automatic weather station data for the night of 11 August.\nThe winds exhibit similar speeds at all stations and reach their maximum at 2 m at similar\ntimes. The change in wind direction during the night is small at both Agoufou and Bamba,\nbut larger at Edgerit. A closer inspection of data showed that the large swing at Edgerit\noccurred after 0300 UTC and before this the wind direction had changed very little. The\nchange to more northerly flow at Edgerit occurred from 0400 to 0700 UTC and coincided\nwith a period of very low wind speed (close to 1 m s\u22121).\nb. Comparisons with numerical models\nThe ECMWF operational analysis and the Met Office UM operational forecast model\nat global resolution were compared to the balloon data. The ECMWF operational analysis\nwas available for only 1800, 0000 and 0600 UTC, so the observations as close as possible to\nthese times were used in the comparisons.\nFigure 4 shows that the observed wind direction agrees with models at 0008 and 0405\nUTC, lending confidence to both models and observations as representative of large scale\nboundary layer flow later in the night. The discrepancies in the 1822 UTC profiles cannot be\nexplained, but it is likely that the models are influenced by incorrect local flows or convection\nsince they disagree with each other as well as the observations. Figure 4 also shows that the\n16\nECMWF model depicts a weaker nocturnal jet at 0000 and 0600 UTC than was observed.\nComparisons with the Met Office UM operational forecast model also showed that the wind\nspeeds observed by the balloon were higher than those predicted by the UM forecast. The\nUM showed a consistent bias in temperature of approximately 2 K less than observations.\nThe ECMWF also underestimated temperature, most notably at 0600.\nc. Synoptic scale events - ahead of a trough\nWave tracking, using the technique explained in section 2c, showed an AEW trough\nlocated 500 km to the east of the fieldsite with the northern vortex centred at 20\u25e6N, 1\u25e6E at\n00 UTC on 12 August. This was the second trough to pass during the experiment period.\nThe UM and ECMWF models both showed consistent south westerly winds in the bound-\nary layer in line with the positioning of the trough and geostrophic balance. This lends con-\nfidence to the assertion that tethered balloon measurements reflected the larger scale wind\ndirection for this night.\nb. Night of 18 August 2005\na. Boundary layer observations\nThe balloon observations on 18 August are shown in figure 5. The temperatures were\napproximately 4 K lower than on the 11 August, and the wind speed was less. The wind\nwas particularly calm after sunset near the surface, and the sonde recorded < 1 ms\u22121 in the\nlowest 20 m in the 1909 UTC sounding. This lack of wind only occurred on one other night,\n17\n15 August at 1923 UTC, when a storm was observed to the north at the same time. At\nsunset on 18 August, sporadic cumulus congestus with rain shafts were observed. It could be\non both these days that outflows from storms acted to cancel the developing surface winds,\nor influenced the boundary layer decoupling from the land surface. It would be a point for\nfurther investigation to assess whether this is a common condition in Sahelian boundary\nlayers, and a motivation for more nocturnal boundary layer observations.\nThe balloon observations displayed a bimodal wind direction on 18 August which was\nnot observed on other nights. Figure 5 shows the rapid change in wind direction between the\n0002 UTC profile and the 0207 UTC profile. Before midnight the wind direction recorded by\nthe tethersonde was predominantly from the south-east. This changed abruptly at midnight\nto a more south-westerly direction. Agoufou station data for the night (table 2) showed a\nlight south-westerly flow near sunset changing to a south-easterly direction by 2200 UTC.\nA rapid change back to the south-west was also seen in the station data at midnight. The\nsame directional change from south-easterly (mean 2000 to 2300 UTC) to south-westerly\nwinds (mean 0300 to 0600 UTC) was seen in the station data at Edgerit and Bamba. The\ncorresponding wind speed was also recorded as being extremely low at all stations.\nThe wind change at midnight was not associated with a gust front, as no notable changes\nin temperature (nor humidity) were recorded in the station or balloon data. However the\nsonic anemometer at Agoufou measured a short burst of high turbulent kinetic energy at the\nsame time as the wind change to south-westerly. The ground measurements, coupled with\nthe balloon data, indicate that there was possibly some mesoscale circulation influencing the\nregion, with wind from the east which developed against a weak monsoon inflow from the\nsouth-west. The burst in turbulence could have indicated the arrival of a convergence line\n18\nand therefore a change of the dominant influence on boundary layer winds.\nThus, the balloon data depicted an uncertain balance between two flows during the first\npart of the night, which was resolved by station data at the model grid scale (50 to 200 km).\nThe second part of the night was more homogeneous in terms of wind direction.\nThe wind speed recorded by the tethersonde did not increase significantly during the\nnight, unlike most other nights, and speed was seen to decrease somewhat in the later\nprofiles. In comparison to the profiles taken on 11 August and the average profile of figure\n2, the temperature and humidity inversions on 18 August were less pronounced. The Ri\nplots show a much higher level of turbulence (lower Ri) throughout the profile than on 11\nAugust. This is in line with the observation in section 3 that low stability and low jet\nspeeds are interlinked. This is also linked to radiative cooling as more cooling would lead\nto higher stability and faster jets, as seen in the observations at the Cabauw tower of Baas\net al. (2009). The sensible heat flux at Agoufou, shown in table 2, demonstrates that the 18\nAugust had less cooling at night than the 11 August, confirming that the 18 August satisfied\nthese conditions likely to cause slower wind speeds near the surface.\nb. Comparisons with numerical models\nFigure 6 displays comparisons between the balloon observations, the ECMWF analysis\nand the UM forecast. Both models simulated changes in wind direction during the night,\nfrom south-east to south-west. In general models will be expected to show better skill at\nsimulating large scale air motions. Their qualitative agreement with the balloon observations\ncould indicate that wind direction was influenced by mesoscale or large scale wind patterns\n19\nrather than isolated local effects or convective outflow at Agoufou.\nAs for 11 August, the ECMWF model tended to underestimate wind speed in the plan-\netary boundary layer. The UM wind speed was similar to observations at 0000 UTC and\nunderestimated at 0600 UTC. Temperatures in both models were mainly cooler than obser-\nvations.\nc. Synoptic scale events - behind a trough\nWave tracking found an AEW trough axis located to the west of the field site on 18\nAugust. This was the third wave event during the experimental period. Figure 7 shows the\ncorresponding positions of vorticity maxima and UM winds at 925 hPa at 0000 UTC on 19\nAugust 2005; the northern centre of the AEW is notably to the west of the southern centre.\nIn the early evening, UM boundary layer winds at 925hPa were from the south-east,\nreflecting the influence of the synoptic trough. Later model analysis showed a switch to\nmore south-westerly winds, and a strengthening of the nocturnal jet as geostrophic wind\nassociated with the surface heat low and monsoon inflow reached the site location. By\n0600 UTC a strong south-westerly flow existed over Burkina Faso, southern Mali and Niger\nassociated with the low level monsoon. The UM simulated a gradual change in wind direction\nunlike the sharp change in direction at midnight observed by the tethersonde and surface\nstations. The switch in winds to the southwest during the night did not occur in the model\n850 hPa winds, and the mid-troposphere winds continued to be south-south-easterly.\nThis case has displayed wind directional changes which were consistent between surface\nstations, the balloon data and model and are explained by the large scale synoptic situa-\n20\ntion. This could indicate that the local boundary layer can be affected by trough passage if\nconditions are favourable.\n5. Discussion\nThe results from the tethered balloon experiments and the subsequent investigations\nwith numerical models have provided new information on the boundary layer evolution in\nthe Sahelian region of West Africa. The direction and speed of the winds observed by the\nballoon on all nights is consistent with the expected monsoon flow shown in the analysis of\ndropsondes in (Parker et al. 2005b). The rate of change at which the wind speed increases\non some nights suggests a fast switching mechanism between convective vertical circulation\ndomination and monsoonal, horizontal influences.\nFor both case studies detailed, the maximum nocturnal wind speeds were underrepre-\nsented in the two global models used for comparison. This in agreement with Cuxart et al.\n(2006), where comparisons between several global models and a Large-Eddy Model showed\nunderestimation of wind speed below 200 m by operational models. Our findings are also\nconsistent with the modeling studies of the Bode\u00b4le\u00b4 NBL in Todd et al. (2008), where there\nwas an underestimation of the observed jet by models. Agusti-Panareda et al. (2009) looked\nat mean ECMWF model biases in comparison to radiosonde data and found systematic\nerrors in temperature in the Sahel region and a general overestimation of winds in contradic-\ntion to our findings from the case studies. However, the diurnal cycle, and the NBL was not\nisolated in the study so it may be that boundary layer mixing is too high at night, but the\nday time positive bias in wind dominates the mean signal. Since the southerly, nocturnal\n21\nwinds are primarily responsible for the northwards transport of moisture, it is important to\ninvestigate how an underestimate of low level wind strength affects the moisture flux.\nFigure 8 shows profiles of night time horizontal moisture flux from observations and UM\nsimulations for the nights of the case studies using time-averaged profiles from each of the\ntimes presented in figures 4 and 6. The graphs show wind speeds multiplied by specific\nhumidity and density for each level recorded. For 11 August, there is a much greater mean\nmoisture flux from observations than model for the night. When the fluxes were integrated\nover 12 hours over a depth of 130 m, the mean flux from the observations was 0.11 kg m\u22121,\ncompared to 0.07 kg m\u22121 in the model. The model underestimates the moisture flux in this\nlayer, which is expected as the winds were significantly underestimated for the night. For\n18 August however, the model mean moisture flux over 60 m for the night was 0.06 kg m\u22121,\ncloser to the observations integrated over the same depth, 0.04 kg m\u22121. This was due to\nthe overestimation of moisture by the model in the earliest profile. This compensates for\nthe lower winds, achieving a good representation of the overall moisture flux on the nights\nwhere the model predicts high specific humidity.\nTo assess the significance of moisture transport in the lower layers, radiosonde profiles\nfrom Niamey (13.48\u25e6N, 2.17\u25e6E) for July and August 2006 were examined and the result\nfrom August is shown in figure 9. Both months\u2019 data showed that the moisture transport\nnorthwards primarily takes place in the lower layers, below 900 hPa in agreement with\nLothon et al. (2008). This level was often reached in the balloon measurements, indicating\nthat the findings of this study have wider implications for moisture transport.\nDespite the underestimation of winds by the models, it should be noted that there have\nbeen changes to the boundary layer schemes in more recent versions of both the UM (version\n22\n6.3, Brown et al. 1957) and the ECMWF (Tompkins et al. 2004), since the versions of the\nmodels used in this study. It would be beneficial in future work to revisit observations in\nthe Sahel region to establish whether the deficiencies still exist using these schemes. Our\nresults emphasise the need for accurate depiction of the speed of winds in the boundary\nlayer, and show how underestimation has consequences for moisture flux estimation which\ncould in turn impact on convection prediction.\nReturning to the balloon observations, local nocturnal boundary winds generally aligned\nwith south westerly flow into the continent-scale heat low. However, there was evidence\nthat winds could be influenced by changes in mesoscale or synoptic scale flow. The times\nwhen wind direction appeared to be influenced by larger scale movements (as on 18 August),\nwere when wind speeds were lower, at times when there was a weaker monsoon inflow and\ntherefore larger scale AEW dynamics could hold greater influence on boundary layer winds.\nThis point requires further investigation as the evidence is taken from one case study only.\n6. Summary and final comments\nThis is the first presentation of dynamical and thermodynamical observations taken of the\nnocturnal boundary layer of the climate sensitive Sahel region during the monsoon. These\nresults have given some insight into real boundary layer features in a region which is very\nsensitive to changes in moisture and is particularly vulnerable to inter-annual variability of\nrainfall. Processes were observed to change at a very fine temporal scale; these would not\nbe captured with 6 hour sampling and only marginally with 3 hour. Thus this data set is\nparticularly useful for its time-resolution, and also for its abundance of surface station data\n23\navailable to corroborate findings.\nThe observations have provided some confirmations of boundary layer structure theory\nand of numerical modeling. Strong inversions of temperature and humidity occurred directly\nafter sunset. Inversions were eroded during the night by mixing caused by increases in wind\nspeed and turbulence.\nDue to the low altitude of the measurements, little turning of the winds was found and\nwind direction was generally observed to settle to the south-west by the early hours of the\nmorning, despite any initial variation in direction. Comparisons with numerical models\nshowed that observed wind speeds were higher than model wind speed and this could lead\nto an underestimation of moisture flux.\nCorrelations between unusual model and observed wind direction changes on 18 August\n2005 suggested that the local boundary layer could be affected by non-local conditions on\nthe large scale such as AEW activity.\nFinally, the variability in these findings points to the need for more investigation into\nnocturnal boundary layers in this region. The role of nocturnal fluxes in synoptic dynamics\nis unknown and the link between boundary layer conditions and changes in convection and\nthe alteration of synoptic features such as African Easterly Waves is yet to be explored.\nAcknowledgments.\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the AMMA community and the people of Hombori\nand Agoufou for their support of this research.
