The analysis is also suitable for design and op-\ntimization of other reported current-mode active matrix addressed\nFED or organic light-emitting displays.\nIndex Terms\u2014Active matrix, carbon nanotube (CNT), current-\ncopier, current-mode, field emission display (FED), flat-panel dis-\nplay, Monte Carlo, organic light-emitting display (OLED), poly-\ncrystalline silicon (poly-Si), thin film transistor (TFT).\nI. INTRODUCTION\nF IELD emission displays (FED) and organic light-emittingdisplays (OLEDs) are currently the two most promising\ndisplay technologies that are likely to replace the dominant\nliquid crystal display in the future [1], [2]. In both technologies,\nthe luminance of the lighting element is proportional to its\ncurrent density, and therefore current-mode pixel driving ap-\nproaches appear to be a natural solution for high quality FEDs\nor OLEDs. To date, current-copier and current-mirror type pixel\ncircuitry based on amorphous silicon (a-Si) or polycrystalline\nsilicon thin film transistor (poly-Si TFT) technologies have\nbeen proposed for the active matrix addressed OLEDs [3],\n[4]. Lin et al. [5] used a current-mirror-based switch-current\nmemory pixel circuit for OLEDs to improve the accuracy and\noperation frequency, and Levy et al. [6] has already designed a\nCMOS subthreshold-voltage-scaling current-mirror driver for\nOLED-on-silicon to improve the bandwidth and settling be-\nhavior. Recently, the design of poly-Si TFT current-modulated\nFED pixels based on carbon nanotube (CNT) emitters was\nalso reported [7]. These current-mode pixel drivers greatly im-\nprove the display uniformity, compared with the voltage-mode\nManuscript received April 19, 2005.

During the sampling phase, the video signal is con-\nverted to a current signal , then sampled into the current\nsink transistor during row selection. During the hold phase,\nthe current sink transistor reproduces and holds the current\nsignal to drive the lighting element. Theoretically, the modu-\nlated emission current is equal to the input data current ,\nindependent of the process variations of the circuit components.\nHowever, there are usually some deviations of from due\nto several undesired effects which are sensitive to the process\nvariations of circuit components. Thus, the output linearity of\nthe driver circuitry and the emission current uniformity may de-\nteriorate.\nIn this paper, the mechanisms that cause the current devia-\ntions from ideal are carefully investigated for the first time. A\nmodification of the pixel circuitry in Fig. 1, with an additional\nfeedback capacitance between \u2019s source and drain is pro-\nposed and analyzed. The Monte Carlo analysis, taking account\nof the process variations, predicts the performance of the cur-\nrent-copier pixel circuits in a true poly-Si TFT process. The cir-\ncuit simulation in the work is based on the RPI Polysilicon TFT\nmodel using the Silvaco Smart-Spice circuit simulator [10]. The\nsetup for the simulation can be seen in [7]. Although the study in\nthis work is based on the current-copier FED pixel circuit, it is\nalso very suitable for other current-mode active matrix display\npixel drivers for FEDs and OLEDs.\n0018-9383\/$20.00 \u00a9 2005 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

ANALYSIS OF THE CURRENT ERRORS\nFor the current-copier FED pixel shown in Fig. 1, in a realistic\ncase, the finally modulated emission current is given by [11]\n(1)\nwhere is the transconductance\nfactor of , and are the gate stored voltage and\nthe drain voltage shift which occurs when the pixel operation\nchanges from the sampling phase to the hold phase, and is a\nconstant associated with the channel length modulation and the\nkink effects of the poly-Si TFTs.\nEquation (1) shows that and may cause devi-\nation of from . As illustrated in Fig. 2, is com-\nposed of two parts: the falling part due to the charge\ninjection and clock feed-through effects on and the rising\npart due to s drain-to-gate coupling. The following\ndiscussions will analyze the two parts of and present the\nmechanisms that produce , as well as the relations\nbetween , , and the circuit components.\nA. Impacts of s Switching Effects\nThe main factor that induces the sampled error is the\ncharge injection and clock feedthrough effects of . In\nFig. 1, as begins to fall to turn off the switch, mobile\ncharges exit through both the drain end and the source end of\n. The charges transferred to the cause a reduction to\nthe sampled voltage, which can be expressed as [12]\n(2)\nwhere is s threshold voltage, denotes the frac-\ntion of the channel charge that flows into , depending on\nthe voltage swing and falling rate of .

However, decreasing s length will\ncause larger leakage current in the hold phase; increasing\nand decreasing s width will prolong the required settling\ntime; lowering the swing will increase , s ON\nresistance and thereafter the settling time; finally, the limited\npixel select-on time makes it difficult to slow s falling rate\ntoo much. That implies some compromises are necessary to be\nconsidered in the design to achieve the best performance, and\nis difficult to be completely eliminated.\nB. Drain-to-Gate Coupling\nAnother effect that contributes to the sampled error is\nthe drain-to-gate coupling of through the drain\/gate capac-\nitance . When the circuit switches from the sampling phase\nto the hold phase, the increase of may be coupled to the\ngate with the parasitic drain\/gate capacitance , and increase\nFig. 5.

The Impacts of ON-Resistance\nWhen the data current is sampled into the current sink tran-\nsistor , the nonzero resistance of causes a voltage drop\non the switch. So there is\n(6)\nwhere\n(7)\nand\n(8)\nmust be kept small enough , oth-\nerwise will be drawn into the triode operation region and\nbring a large sampled error of for reproducing the sampled\ncurrent during hold phase.

The\nlarger will cause smaller , and for a given input\ndata current, the smaller induces larger based on (9).\nThereafter, a larger emission current will be reproduced during\nthe hold phase.\n(9)\nFig. 7 shows the linear relation between and the\nof , and the increased with increasing\nof , which agrees with the above arguments very\nwell. From (9), increasing the conductance of may\ncause a decrease of But, the increase of the conductance\nwill also increase , reduce , and finally lower\nthe . Therefore, an increase of with increased carrier\neffective mobility of and can be found in Fig. 8.\nIII. CURRENT-COPIER PIXEL CIRCUIT WITH\nA FEEDBACK CAPACITANCE\nThe main factor that induces the deviation of from is\ncharge injection and clock through effects of , and is pos-\nsibly partially cancelled by adding a dummy transistor [13] or\nusing a CMOS transmission gate instead of the n-TFT switch\n[14]. However, they both increase the pixel complexity with an\nadditional TFT and input pulse signal. From Fig. 2, it is seen that\nthe may counteract . In fact, as illustrated in\n(5), Figs. 6 and 7, since the curve of has a sim-\nilar change with that of (Fig. 9), choosing\na suitable may produce a that can effectively re-\nduce over the whole current range. Fig. 10 shows the\nimproved linearity of the pixel circuit with adding a feedback\ncapacitance between s gate and drain.\nIV.

Fortunately, because the human eye is not sensitive to\na smooth luminance variation in the long-range regime (a range\nof viewing angles from about 30 to 60 ) [15] and the TFT tech-\nnology in a short-range regime can show good uniformity of the\nelectrical characteristics, it is very promising to design the cur-\nFig. 11.

CONCLUSION\nThe factors that contribute to the current nonuniformity in\nthe poly-Si TFT current-copier FED pixel circuit are carefully\ninvestigated, including; 1) the charge injection and clock\nfeedthough effects, 2) drain-to-gate coupling of the current\nsink TFT and, 3) the ON-resistance of the switch TFT. Detailed\nanalysis of the modulated emission current varying with the\ncircuit component parameters is very important for designing\nand optimizing the pixel circuit for high performance displays.\nIt is also found that through adding a feedback capacitance, the\noutput linearity of the circuit can be improved at some comprise\nof emission current uniformity. Monte Carlo analysis shows\nthe nonuniformity of the current-copier circuit, and proves\nthe importance of greatly improving the process to develop\nhigh-resolution and high-brightness active matrix addressed\ndisplays. The work in this paper is also useful to analyze and\noptimize other current-mode active matrix pixel drive circuits\nthat have been reported.\nREFERENCES\n[1] S. Itoh and M.
