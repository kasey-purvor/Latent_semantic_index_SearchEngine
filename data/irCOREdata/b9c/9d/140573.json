INTRODUCTION \n \n \nNorth-eastern Brazil is located between the latitudes of 1\u00b0 02\u2019 S and 18\u00b0 20\u2019 S and the longitudes of \n34\u00b0 47\u2019 W and 48\u00b0 45\u2019 W. It has nine states: Maranh\u00e3o, Piau\u00ed, Cear\u00e1, Rio Grande do Norte, Para\u00edba, \nPernambuco, Alagoas, Sergipe and Bahia (see Figure 1). With a land area of 1.558 million km\u00b2, this \nregion represents 18.23% of the Brazilian territory. According to climatic conditions, land \ncharacteristics and vegetation, the region can be divided into four sub-regions: mid-north, forest \narea, wild-lands and back-lands. With the exception of the forest area, which has a very fertile soil \nand receives high annual precipitation levels, the average annual temperature in the region is 27\u00b0C \nand the annual precipitation varies from 400 to 600 mm with an intense evaporation rate of 2,500 \nmm\/year [2]. Ninety-one percent of the area of the Northeast Region experience drought periods, \nwhich has been associated with El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) [3].  \n \nThe main river in the region is the S\u00e3o Francisco River, which has been extensively exploited for \nhydroelectric power production [4]. Currently, ten main hydroelectric power plants and several \nsmall units, with a total installed capacity of 10.36 GW, are supplying electricity locally [5,6]. The \nregion has 18.23% of the national population, and the urban population accounts for 69% of the \ntotal population. The region has been experiencing an industrial boom since 1990 and is currently \nresponsible for 13% of the national GDP [7]. The sugar industry is a major income source. The \nfavourable climatic conditions for cultivating sugarcane have been recognised since the early days \nof the Portuguese colonisation. In 2000, cultivated area and production of sugarcane in the region \nrepresented 23% and 18.5% of the respective total national figures [8]. Figure 2 shows the shares of \nthe individual States to the region\u2019s sugarcane cultivated area.  \n \nSugarcane is cultivated mainly on flat terrain, while other crops are planted on hills where \nsugarcane has proven not to be competitive. Beyond its low competitiveness and the old-fashioned \nharvesting technology employed, the other key problem facing the region\u2019s sugar industry is the \nmoderate drought conditions, such as the most recent events of 1997, 1998 and 1999. To minimise \nthe effects of such phenomena and increase the competitiveness, several sugar mills are investing in \nirrigation projects. Mechanised harvesting of sugarcane reduces production costs by up to 50% \nwhen compared with the traditional manual technique [9,10].  \n \nDuring the period 1990 \u2013 1999, the region\u2019s power consumption increased by 53.5% [6]. The risk \nof power shortages in the North-east has been predicted since 1998, when studies showed that \nelectricity consumption would exceed its generation by 5% in 2001 [6,11]. Electricity consumption \nper capita has been increasing rapidly since 1995, and it has been estimated that an investment of \nUS$ 3 billion per year, for the next ten years, is necessary to meet the demand on power [12]. With \nthe restructuring of the Brazilian power-generation sector, natural gas is expected to increase its \nparticipation in the primary energy matrix. The originally-planned Brazilian-Government \nprivatisation programme did not progress satisfactorily, forcing the Government to adopt a hybrid-\nmodel strategy, with private and public power generators sharing the same market. In 2000, the \nGovernment launched the Thermo-electric Priority (PPT) Programme. The Programme of \nIncentives to Alternative Sources (PROINFA), and the Emergency Programme of Wind Power \n(PROE\u00d3LICA) were some examples of other programmes launched by the Brazilian Government \nto encourage the use of renewables in the energy matrix. In 2001, Brazil faced a power shortage. As \n 3\na result, the Government decided to accelerate the deployment of the PPT Programme and increase \nthe thermal power generation. A new and promising market opened for the sugar mills; bagasse (the \nwaste fibre obtained after the extraction of sugar syrup from the sugarcane) currently represents an \nattractive biomass fuel, and as a result its market price has increased.  \n \n \n \n \n2.  ALTERNATIVES TO HYDROELECTRIC POWER GENERATION IN NORTH-     \nEASTERN BRAZIL \n \n \nThe north-eastern Brazil\u2019s social and economic development is strongly linked with the S\u00e3o \nFrancisco river and Hydroelectric Company of S\u00e3o Francisco (CHESF) [13]. In 2001, CHESF had \nits best operational results, with total revenue exceeding US$ 1.2 billions and a profit greater than \nUS$ 268 millions [14]. This profit represented an increase of 15.7% over 2000, despite the power-\nsupply restrictions imposed by the Government. Several studies have proposed modifications in the \noperation of some of the power plants in order to meet the electric demand during peak periods \n[11,15,16]. The losses in power generation have been estimated as equal to a power capacity loss of \n2.5 MW, which if used by industry, would generate more than US$ 4 million\/year [15]. To \novercome these losses, the region should import electricity from other regions [11], such as the \nAmazon region, or install new thermal power plants. \n  \nIrrigation, especially in arid areas is necessary to promote agricultural productivity. It increases crop \nyields by 2.5 to 3 times, increases the value of the land by a factor of 5, and allows for at least 2 \nharvests and off-season harvests [15].  Studies have indicated that the potential total irrigated area \nof the S\u00e3o Francisco River valley is 691,000 km\u00b2 [15]. Considering only areas where the soil is \nsuitable for irrigated crops, within a radius of 60 km from the water source and with a maximum \nelevation of 120 m, the area to be irrigated is reduced to 81,000 km\u00b2. The use of water for irrigation \nfor an area bigger than 8 km\u00b2 would affect the operation of the power-generation plants installed in \nthe S\u00e3o Francisco valley and the power-generation goals needed for the region [15]. Therefore, \nconsidering the use of water for irrigation, development projects for the region, and the fact that \nnew power plants will not generate power competitively, it can be concluded that the cost-effective \nhydroelectric potential of S\u00e3o Francisco River is exhausted [4]. \n \nBrazil has a vast potential for power generation from renewable sources. The north-eastern region \nhas notable wind-energy potential and some of it is being utilised for water pumping [17]. Small \nhydroelectric units are also being explored in the region. The solar intensity in the region is capable \nof supporting extensive photovoltaic and solar thermal options for some urban and rural \napplications [2,17]. Biomass is widely available in the region and has been used as an industrial fuel \nin pulp and paper mills, sugar mills, petrochemical plants, pig iron and steel plants, and other \nproduction activities. Incorporation of state-of-the-art, renewable-energy technologies and \nassessment of relevant international experiences are strategies adopted by the Action Plan for \nDeveloping a Sustainable Market for Rural Renewable Energy Services in Brazil [18]. Renewables, \nparticularly wind and biomass, will have a considerable share in future power-generation matrix. \nSugarcane bagasse has the greatest potential for the short and medium term due to the strong sugar \nindustry in the region. Other residues (e.g. rice straw and husk, and wood bark) represent other \npromising sources of biomass.  \n \n \n \n \n 4\n3.  BIOMASS UTILISATION  \n \n \nBiomass fuels can be produced as by-products of the agriculture, forestry and the manufacture of \nhigh-value goods (e.g. pulp and paper, sugar and animal feed). According to available sources,  \nbiomass can generally be classified into the following categories [19,20]:  \n \n\u2022 wood residues \n\u2022 agricultural residues (from crops and farm animals) \n\u2022 process wastes \n\u2022 dedicated energy crops \n\u2022 municipal solid waste (MSW) \n \nAs a replacement for fossil fuels, biomass, as an energy source, has the potential to substantially \nreduce carbon dioxide emissions. Although biomass was considered in the past to be a low-grade \nfuel, with its use associated usually with poverty, recent utilisation trends and assessment studies \nindicate that it will play a key role in satisfying mankind future energy requirements in a sustainable \nmanner. Currently, renewables represents about 14% of primary-energy consumption in the world, \nwith biomass being the major contributor (i.e. about 10%) [21,22]. In industrialized countries it \naccounts for 3% of primary-energy consumption, whereas it represents 35% of primary-energy \nconsumption in developing countries. For 75% of developing-countries\u2019 population, biomass \nrepresents the most important source of energy. \n \nNew techniques have been devised for the utilisation of biomass for energy production, including:  \n \n\u2022 Thermo-chemical conversion, i.e. combustion, gasification, pyrolysis, liquefaction, \nhydrothermal upgrading (HTU). \n\u2022 Biochemical conversion, i.e. fermentation and anaerobic digestion. \n\u2022 Extraction of vegetable oils.  \n \nCombustion can be utilised for power and\/or heat generation. This technique is widely applied and \nhas a great potential for improvement. Direct combustion involves the employment of a wide \nvariety of systems including the most common pile burners, stocker (or grate-fired) combustors, and \nfluidised-bed combustors. Suspension burning, whole-tree energy method and co-firing (especially \nwith coal) are examples of other alternative biomass-combustion technologies that have been \ndevised [22-27]. Gasification involves the partial oxidation of biomass in order to convert it into a \ngaseous fuel. The gas produced can be employed for the generation of power (via a steam Rankine \ncycle, a gas-turbine combined-cycle system or an internal-combustion engine) and\/or heat. \nBiomass-gasification technology is still at the demonstration phase, while the second generation of \nbiomass gasifiers is at the development state [22-26]. Pyrolysis is the thermal destructive distillation \nof biomass in the near absence of oxygen at a temperature of around 500\u00baC [26]. The process yields \ncharcoal \u2212 a more convenient solid fuel, liquids (i.e. tars and oils, or bio-oils) and low-heating value \ngaseous products. Temperature and heating rate can be adjusted to favour one of these products. \nConventional slow pyrolysis is commonly applied for the production of charcoal, with a huge \nconversion-efficiency range. Pyrolysis for the production of bio-oils is still at the pilot-plant phase \nand faces some technical barriers. With fast (or flash) pyrolysis, the liquid yield could be up to 70% \nof the mass of the dry feedstock. Fast pyrolysis at elevated temperatures (i.e. between 800 and \n900\u00b0C) converts up to 80% of the biomass into a gas rich in hydrogen and carbon monoxide. \nLiquefaction is a low-temperature, high-pressure thermo-chemical process using a catalyst. \nHowever, fast pyrolysis is simpler and more cost-effective [22,27]. HTU, which is a process \ndeveloped by Shell, converts biomass, at a high pressure and moderate temperatures, in water, to \nbio-crude. This technique is still in a pre-pilot-plant phase [22].  \n 5\n \nEthanol \u2212 a liquid fuel \u2212 can be produced from biomass by alcoholic-fermentation. Fermentation, \nbased on sugarcane, sugar beet and grains is a commercially-proven technology in many countries, \nincluding, Brazil, the USA, France, Germany, Sweden [28-36]. The use of wood as a feedstock, \nhowever, is still under development [37-39]. Anhydrous ethanol or neat ethanol (i.e. 95 % ethanol \nand 5% water by volume) may be used directly as a substitute for petrol in modified engines [29]. \nDry ethanol can be mixed with gasoline (as an octane-number enhancer), with 6 to 22% by volume, \nto produce gasohol [29]. During the peak of the Brazilian Pro-alcohol (Proalcool) Programme (i.e. \nthe substitution of ethanol for petrol in passenger and light-commercial vehicles) in the mid-\neighties, the Brazilian automobile fleet had 96% of neat-ethanol-fuelled cars [29]. Ethanol price did \nnot drop as expected and competition with gasoline led to serious problems for the Proalcool \nprogramme. Today, ethanol price is 85% of the gasoline price in Brazil [22,39,40]. Anaerobic \ndigestion of biomass is a process that results in the production of biogas (i.e. a mixture of mainly \nmethane and carbon dioxide) cost effectively [41]. Biogas has been produced commercially, \nemploying animal manure, sewage sludge and the organic fraction of municipal solid waste \n(MSW), in conventional anaerobic digesters or two-phase anaerobic fermentation [41-44]. \n \nVegetable oils, extracted from seeds, crops, nuts, fruits and leaves, can be used as fuels for diesel \nengines (i.e. as bio-diesel), but they are relatively expensive [22]. Vegetal oils can be used in diesel \nengines either mixed with diesel fuel or alone without major modifications to the engine. However, \nsome difficulties, such as oil deterioration and incomplete combustion have been reported. \nTransesterification (i.e. reaction with ethanol or methanol in the presence of a catalyst) of vegetable \noils leads to superior diesel-fuel substitutes (i.e. ethyl esters or methyl esters) [45]. In Europe, rape-\nseed oil methyl ester (RME), produced from oilseed rape is the main substitute fuel, while soybean \noil is used in the USA and canola oil in Canada [46].  \n \n \n \n \n4.  BIOMASS RESOURCES IN NORTH-EASTERN BRAZIL \n \n \n4.1.  Wood Residues, Agricultural Residues and Process Wastes \n \n \nWood residues are produced by wood-product industries (i.e. saw mills, paper mills and furniture \nindustry). Agricultural residues from crops include mainly sugarcane leaves and trash and bamboo \nbranches produced during harvesting. Process wastes are produced primarily by sugar mills (in the \nform of bagasse) and the pulping industry (mainly in the form of black liquor).  \n \nIn north-eastern Brazil, agricultural residues and process wastes are the main components of the \nregional biomass resource when compared with wood residues. The region has more than 72 pulp \nand paper mills. Other wood-product industries (i.e. sawmills and furniture industry) are widely \ndispersed in the region, and their contribution to large-scale electricity generation is deemed to be \nnot cost-effective. Paper mills utilise bamboo, eucalyptus, sisal, sugarcane bagasse and other fibres. \nDue to the significant importance of the sugar industry for the local economy, sugarcane bagasse \nappears to be the logical main source of biomass in north-eastern Brazil. Sugarcane has an average \nharvesting period of 167 days per year [40]. This period, however, varies depending on climatic \nconditions. In order to guarantee the continuity of power production in a biomass-based system, \nother biomass sources with analogous characteristics should be readily available to complement or \nback up sugarcane bagasse. Bamboo, represents the ideal candidate for this purpose. \n \n 6\nSugarcane can be used for the production of sugar and ethanol. Both products generate bagasse as \nresidue after the sugarcane is crushed for juice extraction, as shown in Fig. 3. The cost of \nproduction of sugar in Brazil is low (i.e. under US$ 200\/tonne) and the industry employs directly \napproximately 1.0 million people [40]. When sugar production becomes less attractive, due to the \ndrop in sugar price on the international market, and the ethanol production turns to be more \nprofitable, the producers can switch the production to meet the market expectations. Due to the lack \nof mechanisation in the north-eastern Brazil, the local industry employs 2.2 times more people than \nthe sister industry in the middle-south region of the country [39,40]. The most remarkable \nimprovements in agricultural and industrial productivity have been achieved in S\u00e3o Paulo (outside \nthe studied area) and Alagoas States due to the adoption of the Proalcool Programme. \n  \nThe utilisation of sugarcane bagasse for electricity generation purposes in north-eastern Brazil will \ntake advantage of the well established sugar industry in the region. Brazil is today the second \nlargest sugarcane producer in the world [47]. Important improvements were achieved in juice \nextraction efficiency, vinasse recycling and reduction of fermentation time. Manual harvesting is \nstill the major practice in Brazil; mechanisation could reduce the harvesting costs by at least 30% \n[9]. However, due to topography limits, mechanised harvesting could cover only approximately \n50% of the cultivated area [9]. Burning of sugarcane fields prior to the harvest is also a common \npractice in Brazil as it improves the throughput in both manual and mechanical harvesting. Burning \nis now being prevented due to its impacts on the environment and human health. In addition, the \nlosses in cane sucrose are considerable, resulting in ethanol losses in the range of 5.9 to 13.5 m\u00b3 per \nkm\u00b2 of cultivated area [9]. Green harvest for sugarcane brings the possibility of utilising the cane \nresidues for animal feed, as an organic fertilizer or biomass fuel for energy. The combined use of \nbagasse and sugarcane residues could lower the ethanol costs considerably in Brazil [9,39,48]. \n \nThe mean yield of sugarcane cultivation in north-eastern Brazil in 2000 was 5.305 ktonnes\/km\u00b2 (i.e. \nbetween 3.96 and 6.43 ktonnes\/km\u00b2) [8]. With about 11,000 km\u00b2 of land area devoted to sugarcane \ncultivation in 2000, the total production of sugarcane was 58.68 Mtonnes [8] The production of one \ntonne of sugar requires approximately 8.5 tonnes of sugarcane, while 1.0 m\u00b3 of ethanol requires \n12.5 tonnes [40]. The weight of the bagasse produced, at 50% of moisture content, is about 30% of \nthe weight of sugarcane used [49-51]. Accordingly, in 2000, north-eastern Brazil produced about 17 \nMtonnes of bagasse.  \n \nPhysically, bagasse consists of three components (i.e. pith, fibre and rind) mixed in different \nproportions. In a typical sample, the proportions are about 5% pith, 73% fibres, and 22% rind by \nweight [52]. Bagasse fibre has up to 54.3% cellulose, 29.7% hemicellulose, and 24.4% lignin [53]. \nThe density of bagasse is around 492 kg\/m\u00b3 [52]. Depending on the region where the sugarcane is \ncultivated, bagasse shows different ultimate analysis [49-51,53-57] (see Table 1). The empirical \nformula for bagasse, based on the average values for the ultimate analysis is C3.9H6.0O2.7N0.01 [58]. \nThe moisture content of bagasse commercialised in Pernambuco State varies from 45% to 52%.  \n \nAs it is the common practice in the north-eastern Brazil to utilise bagasse for energy production \ndirectly from the supplier, without any drying, in this study, the lower heating value on a wet basis \nwill be employed for estimating the energy potential associated with this biomass resource. Dry \nbagasse has an ash-free gross heating value of around 21.5 MJ\/kg [50,53]. By employing the \nmethodology suggested by Quaak et al. [23], assuming typical moisture content of 50% and the \naverage ultimate analysis presented in Table 1, the lower heating value for bagasse was calculated \nas 8.13 MJ\/kg. \n \nSugarcane leaves are around 1.5 m long, and after being chopped, they have a bulk density of about \n30 kg\/m\u00b3 [54]. Leaves represent 4% of the sugarcane stalk weight [54]. At least 25% recovery rate \nof such agricultural residues is possible if mechanisation is implemented in harvesting sugarcane \n 7\n[9,54]. This results in an estimated potential resource of about 580 ktonnes of sugarcane residues in \nthe north-eastern region in 2000 [8]. However, with only 30% of the cultivated area being subjected \nto mechanised harvesting, a resource of about 175 ktonnes is more feasible. Agricultural residues \nfrom sugarcane cultivation have approximately the same heating value as bagasse [9]. \n \nAdopting a heating value of 8 MJ\/kg and an annual production of around 17.5 Mtonne of sugarcane \nbagasse, the total energy potential of bagasse in the north-eastern region of Brazil can be estimated \nas 140 PJ\/year. The additional energy source from utilising agricultural residues from sugarcane \nplantations is approximately 1.4 PJ\/year. \n \nThe price of bagasse, produced by the local sugar mills and exceeding their own use for energy, \nused to be symbolic. However, due to the Brazilian power crisis and recent Government incentives \nto produce power from biomass, the price of sugarcane bagasse is experiencing a sharp rise. The \nprice practiced by the local market is in the range from US$ 3.5\/tonne to US$ 11.84\/tonne [59], \nwith an average value of US$ 7.67\/tonne. Hence, the maxomum market price of sugarcane bagass is \naround US$ 1.5\/GJ, without transportation costs included. Biomass requires space for storage as \nwell as transportation to power-generation sites. Transportation is a significant cost item in running \na thermal conversion system based on biomass. In the north-east of Brazil, the transportation costs \nof bagasse are 2.4, 4.2, and 6.0 US$\/tonne on a wet basis for distances of 50, 100 and 150 km, \nrespectively [59].  \n \nBamboo is the term commonly used to describe a particular taxonomic group of large woody \ngrasses which grows in relatively warm and humid climates, with an annual precipitation of at least \n1000 mm. It reaches maturity within 5 years and some species can reach more than 20 metres in \nheight. With the exception of Europe, bamboo grows naturally in subtropical and temperate zones \nin all continents. In Brazil, there are more than 80 different species of bamboo, but the most \ncommon is bambusa vulgaris. North-eastern Brazil, in particular, offers the most favourable \nconditions for bamboo cultivation. Bamboo can be employed for around 1500 commercial \napplications, including the food, construction, and pulp and paper industry [60]. The largest bamboo \ncommercial cultivation in north-eastern Brazil belongs to Jo\u00e3o Santos Industrial Group, with more \nthan 108 km\u00b2 cultivated in Maranh\u00e3o, Para\u00edba and Pernambuco States [61]. Its two pulp and paper \nmills (CIB Portela and Itapaj\u00e9 Pap\u00e9is) produce sack paper and cardboard from this resource. \n \nAgricultural residues of bamboo are generated as a consequence of its handling techniques. After \nthe harvest, the stalks are left in the field for natural drying. Almost all leaves and small branches, \nwhich represent 38% of the original weight above the ground for 3-year-old bamboos [62], are lost \nin the field during the approximately 15-day drying period. The processing of bamboo for pulping \nalso generates waste. Aiming at reducing the NaOH consumption during the pulping process, \nbranches and some parts of the stems unsuitable for pulping, are rejected. Rejects account for \napproximately 10% of the pulp production in a mill. The two pulp and paper mills in north-eastern \nBrazil produce 102 ktonnes\/year of paper products and require around 300 ktonnes\/year of bamboo \npulp. They consume about 500 ktonnes\/year of cultivated bamboo, which generate 190 ktonnes\/year \nagricultural residues and 30 ktonnes\/year process waste.  \n \nThe characteristics of phyllostachys nigra, phyllostachys bissetii, and phyllostachys bambusoides \nbamboo species were analysed for energy purposes, whereas those of bambusa vulgaris were \nfurther analysed for the pulp and paper industry utilisation [60-64]. The life cycle for industrial \nbamboo coppices in north-eastern Brazil is two years [61,64]. For samples of this age, the moisture \ncontent has been found to be 8.79% for phyllostachys nigra, 10.66% for phyllostachys bissetii, and \n12.92% for phyllostachys bambusoides [62]. For bambusa vulgaris cultivated in North-eastern \nBrazil, the moisture content is around 35% [64]. The ash content varies between 0.87% and 0.78% \n 8\nfor phyllostachys nigra, phyllostachys bissetii, and phyllostachys bambusoides [62]. For bambusa \nvulgaris, the ash content is around 0.11% [63].  \n \nTable 2 shows the ultimate analysis of the four bamboo species studied. Bamboo has low nitrogen \nand sulphur contents, when compared with coal or other fossil fuels. Therefore, NOx and SO2 \nemissions as a result of its direct combustion are minimal. The silicon content of bamboo species \ntends to increase with the maturity of the plant. In the Brazilian north-east, the first harvest of \nbamboo is within 3 years. The following harvests are within intervals of 2 years. From the fifth \nharvest, the crops must receive more fertilizers to increase the productivity. The low ash and \nchlorine contents make the bamboo very attractive for combustion applications aiming at electricity \ngeneration. The low chlorine content of the bamboo samples means that burning them is unlikely to \nenhance high-temperature corrosion in biomass combustion systems. From the ultimate analysis \npresented in Table 2, the empirical formula for bambusa vulgaris could be written approximately as \nC4.3H3.0O2.6N0.03 [58]. By employing the methodology suggested by Quaak et al. [23] and an ash-\nfree higher heating value of around 24.5 MJ\/kg, the lower heating value on a wet basis for bambusa \nvulgaris was calculated as 12.56 MJ\/kg. \n \nBy assuming that for bamboo leaves and branches have the same lower heating value as the stems, \nthe potential energy resource associated with bamboo agricultural residues in the region is 2.39 \nPJ\/year. The regional energy potential of bamboo process wastes is estimated as 377 TJ\/year.  \n \nCooking, or pulping, liquors are aqueous solutions of chemicals used for delignification of pulping \nraw materials. Black liquor is the effluent waste from the Kraft pulping process, with 15% solids of \nwhich approximately 10% are organic chemicals [65]. Typically, seven tonnes of black liquor are \nproduced for each tonne of pulp [66]. Chemical recovery is the process in which the inorganic \nchemicals employed are regenerated and recovered for re-use [67]. The process involves \nconcentrating the liquor (typically to a solid content of between 65 and 73%) by evaporation and \ncombustion of the strong black liquor in a furnace or a boiler, and results in the recovery of \ntypically 70% of the chemicals and the generation of a large amount of heat [65-68]. Furnaces are \nmore common for small plants, whereas steam boilers are employed with large quantities of black \nliquor. The higher heating value for concentrated black liquor is around 14 MJ\/kg [65,66,68]. The \nBrazilian national production of concentrated black liquor (typically at 70% solid content) in 1999 \nwas 9.737 ktonnes, of which only 1.981 ktonnes were utilised for electricity generation employing \nsteam cycles [6]. The total energy potential of black liquor produced in Brazil in 1999 is \napproximately 136 TJ\/year [6]. North-eastern Brazil has several pulp and paper mills that employ \nthe Kraft pulping process. The most important of these are Bahia Sul Celulose, Santo Amaro and \nBacell S.A. in Bahia State, CIB Portela, Ondunorte-PE and Ponsa in Pernambuco State, Ondunorte-\nPB in Para\u00edba State, and Itapag\u00e9 S.A. in Maranh\u00e3o State. However, no representative figures about \nproduction of pulp in the north-east of Brazil are available. \n \n \n \n4.2.  Energy Crops \n \n \nEnergy crops can be divided basically into two types: herbaceous energy crops and short rotation \ncoppice (SRC). Herbaceous energy crops are mostly types of grasses that could be harvested as hay, \nwhile SRCs are species that can be grown exclusively for energy production (i.e. eucalyptus and \nbamboo). Energy crops bring some inconveniences, including [19,20,24]: \n \n\u2022 Biomass fuels have their costs raised by the necessity of additional labour and equipment for \nharvesting, transportation, handling, storage and processing. \n\u2022 Competition with food and fibre production for land use. \n 9\n\u2022 Removal of additional nutrients from the soil. \n\u2022 Transportation of large volumes of low energy density fuels to conversion plants. \n \nHowever, their utilisation brings about the following additional benefits: \n \n\u2022 In low latitude countries, some crops have high yields and biomass sources compete cost-\neffectively with any other fossil fuel. \n\u2022 Improving the fertility of unproductive saline soils. \n\u2022 Carbon dioxide sequestration. \n \n \nEnergy crops are usually less harmful to the environment than intensive agricultural practices, due \nto lower chemical inputs and less soil disturbance and compaction. Land requirements are strongly \ndependent on biomass crop yields and biomass-to-energy conversion efficiencies. Biomass-to- \nenergy systems always produce considerably more exploitable energy than that required for \nfeedstock production and transportation, and power plant operation [20-22]. The life-cycle CO2 \nbalance of such schemes, i.e. the excess the CO2 produced as a result of the operation of a biomass-\nto-energy facility relative to the CO2 absorbed by the biomass feedstock, is typically 5% [69]. \n \nSimilar climatic conditions and soil conditions are required for the cultivation of sugarcane and \nbamboo. Accordingly, a suitable species of the latter could be cultivated where the topography is \nnot competitive for sugarcane production. Bambusa vulgaris is the logical choice as a dedicated \nenergy crop for north-eastern Brazil. In the region, the average growth rate is 7 cm\/day [64]. Steep \nterrain, which is not suitable for sugarcane plantation, could be used for cultivating bambusa \nvulgaris forests. Harvesting of bamboo is a labour-intensive, un-mechanised practice [60-62]. Jo\u00e3o \nSantos Industrial Group has been developing new competitive techniques for bamboo harvesting \n[61]. \n \nJo\u00e3o Santos Industrial Group reported that the total cost for manual land preparation and planting \nfor sloped areas is around US$ 34,100\/km\u00b2 [61]. For flat areas, the cost drops to around US$ \n23,100\/km\u00b2 when the producer makes use of mechanisation. In very steep areas, the cost is about \nUS$ 66,900\/km\u00b2. Fertilisation cost is around US$ 13,100\/km\u00b2 [61]. By assuming a cultivation area \nconsisting of 60% sloped area, 15% flat area, and 25% very steep area, the average total cultivation \nand fertilisation cost is estimated to be about US$ 55,000\/km\u00b2. By assuming a productivity of 4 \nktonnes\/km\u00b2 per year in the fifth harvest [61], the cultivation and fertilisation cost per tonne is US$ \n13.75. The cost of harvesting is US$ 11.1\/tonne [61]. Accordingly, the total production cost of \nbambusa vulgaris is US$ 24.85\/tonne, or US$ 2.0\/GJ (based on 35% moisture content and a lower \nheating value on a wet basis of 12.56 MJ\/kg). If it is assumed that bamboo is transported to the \nutility site at the same prices as sugarcane bagasse, the average cost of bamboo transportation can \nbe estimated as US$ 0.5\/GJ. Therefore, the average total cost of bamboo as a dedicated energy crop \ncan be estimated as US$ 2.5\/GJ. \n \nBy assuming that 20% of the regional area devoted to sugarcane plantation (i.e. 2,211 km\u00b2) is not \ncompetitive due to topography, and that bambusa vulgaris should be planted on this area, the \npotential yield for this energy crop is 8.84 Mtonnes\/year. However, in order to reduce the \nfertilisation costs, preserve the soil against erosion, and maintain higher bamboo productivity and \nquality, rotation plans for the land are required [61,64]. The regional energy potential of bamboo as \na dedicated energy crop is around 111 PJ\/year. \n \n \n4.3.  Municipal Solid Waste \n \n \n 10\nMunicipal solid waste (MSW) represents a major source of biomass. Recycling of components of \nMSW is worthwhile if it confers economic advantage to purchasers of recycled materials or \nproducts, saves more fuel, brings about environmental benefits or has lower costs than alternative \nmethods of waste management [70]. Due to the fact that rural areas have a low MSW density, the \nutilisation of MSW for energy production is more adequate only in\/or near large urban centres [71]. \nUnprocessed MSW in developed countries consists predominantly of paper, plastic and other \norganics, with approximately 30% moisture content [20]. Despite the fact that the heating value of \nMSW can vary according to its composition (which reflects the social habits and the economy of \nthe region from which it is collected), the mean lower heating value is around 8 MW\/kg [70-72]. \n \nNorth-eastern Brazil accounts for 15% of the national daily amount of MSW produced [73]. Only \n0.54% of the MSW generated is incinerated. The most common practice is landfilling, with the \nwaste in some urban areas not receiving any treatment at all. Landfill emission and effluent \ntreatment are becoming a great concern in urban centres of north-eastern Brazil, such as Recife and \nSalvador. Biogas produced by managed landfills (i.e. landfill gas) can be utilised directly as a low-\nheating-value industrial fuel or upgraded to a pipeline quality-gas for domestic and transport (e.g. \nurban transport busses [74]) applications. \n \nMSW incineration can reduce dramatically CH4 emissions from landfills. Considering that 50% of \nthe total MSW produced annually by the region (i.e. 7.6 Mtonnes [73]) could be treated in energy-\nfrom-waste facilities, the potential energy resource is around 60 PJ\/year. Further studies should be \ncarried out to establish the costs of collecting and treating MSW for energy production in the \nregion. The total cost for converting MSW into electricity, at 23% efficiency, in S\u00e3o Paulo was \nestimated to be US$ 80\/MWh [74]. \n \n \n \n5.  Conclusions \n \n \nThe north-eastern region of Brazil, as well as the whole country, has increasing power demand. The \ncost-effective hydroelectric potential of the region has almost been exhausted. The failure to meet \nthe regional power demand will adversely affect the local economy and the region\u2019s development \nprogrammes. This can increase the gap between such a developing region and the well-developed \nsouth-eastern and southern regions of Brazil.  \n \nThe Government has taken some actions to lessen the dependency on hydroelectric generation in \norder to avoid future power crises in the country. The PPT programme will focus on thermal power \ngeneration using natural gas, while other programmes, such as PROINFA and PROE\u00d3LICA are \nfocusing on power generation from renewable sources. North-eastern Brazil has a considerable \npotential biomass resource as a result of: \n \n\u2022 The region has a great concentration of industries that generates biomass as process wastes or \nagricultural residues (i.e. sugar mills and pulp and paper industry). \n\u2022 The climatic conditions are favourable for growing energy crops (i.e. bamboo and eucalyptus). \n \nThe success of the PROINFA programme in particular depends on the availability of reliable \nassessment of biomass resources in the region.  \n \nThe annual biomass potential of agricultural residue from sugarcane cultivation and bagasses as a \nprocess waste is around 146 PJ (or 40.5 TWh). Sugarcane bagasse represents 97% of this total. The \ncost of sugarcane bagasse as a fuel, neglecting transportation costs, is around US$ 1.5\/GJ (or US$ \n0.005\/kWh), whereas that of sugarcane agricultural residues, considering only transportation costs, \n 11\nis about US$ 0.5\/GJ (or US$ 0.002\/kWh). The States with the greatest potential for generating \nelectricity from that biomass resource are Alagoas, Pernambuco, Bahia and Para\u00edba, with annual \npotentials of 68.2, 39.5, 12.4 and 9.3 PJ respectively.  \n \nBamboo, as a dedicated energy crop, represents a regional potential energy resource of about 111 PJ \n(or 30.8 TWh), at an average cost of about US$ 2.5\/GJ (or US$ 0.009\/kWh), if cultivated in areas \nwhere sugarcane is not competitive. Current bamboo process wastes and agricultural residues in the \nregion represent an annual energy potential in the order of 3 PJ (or 833 GWh).  \n \nMSW appears as the third biomass resource, with an annual energy potential of approximately 60 \nPJ (or 16.7 TWh). However, further studies are required to estimate its cost as a fuel.  \n \n \n 12\nFIGURES \n \nFigure 1 \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2 \n \n \n42,545\n90,793\n455,447\n21,048\n93,479\n339,872\n19,91235,535\n7,271\nMaranh\u00e3o Piau\u00ed Cear\u00e1\nRio Grande do Norte Para\u00edba Pernambuco\nAlagoas Sergipe Bahia\n \n 13\nFigure 3 \n \n \n \n \n \nFIGURES CAPTIONS \n \nFigure 1:   The Brazilian Regions [1] \nFigure 2:   North-east States sugarcane cultivated area in km\u00b2 in 2000 [8]. \nFigure 3:  Sugarcane-based sugar mill production processes [40]. \n \n \nWashing \nJuice Extraction \nJuice Treatment \nFermentation \nJuice Treatment \nSugar Production \nSugarcane \nDistillation Sugar \nAlcohol \n 14\nTABLES \n \n \nTable 1  \n \n \nReferences \n     Elements \n[53] [54] [56] [57] Average \nCarbon (C) 44.40 44.10 48.64 51.70 47.21 \nHydrogen (H2) 6.50 5.26 5.87 6.30 5.98 \nOxygen (O2) 42.00 44.4 42.82 42.00 42.81 \nNitrogen (N2) 0.20 -- 0.16 -- 0.18 \nAsh 7.00 4.20 2.44 3.4 4.26 \n \n \nTable 2  \n \n     Elements phyllostachys nigra \nphyllostachys \nbambusoides \nphyllostachys \nbissetii \nbambusa \nvulgaris \nCarbon (C)  51.19 51.84 51.70 51.58 \nHydrogen (H2) 5.29 5.18 5.00 5.16 \nOxygen (O2) 42.12 41.33 42.11 41.85 \nNitrogen (N2) 0.29 0.60 0.30 0.40 \nChlorine (Cl) 0.14 0.06 0.03 0.08 \nSulphur (S) 0.03 0.05 0.03 0.04 \nAsh 0.87 0.84 0.78 0.11 \n \n \nTABLE CAPTIONS \n \nTable 1: Oven-dry bagasse ultimate analysis.
