A number of issues for further\nresearch are also identified.\nIntroduction\nIn this paper, computer-supported learning (CSL) environments are defined as educational \u2022\nsettings where some or all communications, learning activities and administrative tasks\ntake place through the medium of computer technology. While much research in this area\nfocuses specifically on computer-mediated communication (CMC), we adopt a broader\n32\nALT-J Volume 10 Number \/\ndefinition that also includes the use of multimedia courseware, Web resources and course\nmanagement systems such as WebCT or Blackboard. An emerging term in the\nAustralasian tertiary sector for this type of learning environment is mixed-mode education\n(McNaught, 2001). The critical factors are that students work in a variety of ways with\ncomputer technology and exercise a degree of autonomy that is not commonly found in\nlecture-based courses.\nGender-based differences in performance and interaction style in CSL environments have\nbeen recognized as an important focus for research (Herring, 1993; Weinman and Cain,\n1999; Richardson and French, 2001). There are, however, conflicting views about the\nnature and impact of these differences and questions as to whether some student groups\nare disadvantaged by limited access and technology literacy remain inconclusively\nanswered. Two citations from published sources (American Association of University\nWomen Educational Foundation, 1998; Kleinfeld, 1998) illustrate the point of conflict:\nGirls are under-represented and lower achievers in math, science and technology\nsubjects.\nGirls get higher grades, do better in standard tests and go on to achieve higher\nqualifications.\nThe critical point here is that exactly the same data were used to support both these\narguments, so clearly the matter is open to interpretation.\nMost early research (circa 1990) in this area suggested that women and girls had less\nopportunity and ability to succeed in using technology for educational purposes\n(McMahon, 1994; Weinman and Cain, 1999). More recently it has been found that tech-\nnology access and literacy are disappearing problems and that young male students may be\nthe group with most consistently low achievement levels in CSL (Siann, 1997; Kleinfeld,\n1998). Evidence also suggests that theoretical conceptions of CSL environments as\ndemocratic and offering equal opportunities are flawed because social and educational\ninteraction that takes place through electronic channels loses none of the sociocultural\ncomplexity or gender imbalance that exists in more traditional learning environments\n(Yates, 2001). Research findings from the 1990s are fairly consistent in identifying gender-\ntypical differences in interaction styles, and in approaches to and uses of CSL technology.\nMany studies conclude that, as well as having less access and ability to use technology,\nwomen are further disadvantaged by dominant and sometimes even aggressive male\nbehaviour in CMC environments. However, deeper analysis of the situation raises\nquestions about whether the existence of such differences actually supports the common\nconclusion that women are disadvantaged or simply that they use technology in different\nways.\nThis paper presents the collective experience of a small group of academics with\nexperience of CSL in an international, though predominantly western, world context, and\nsummarizes gender-related issues identified by contemporary research and teaching\npractice. The case presented here is that research findings do not support the conception\nthat women are disadvantaged. With new educational methods and the associated forms of\ninteraction, we may also need to look for new ways of considering identity and binary\nconcepts such as gender.\n33\nCathy Gunn et al Gender issues in computer-supported learning\nA collaborative investigation\nThis exploration of gender issues in CSL began as a collaborative venture to present a\npanel discussion session at the Association of Learning Technology Conference (ALT-C) in\nthe UK in September 2001. Membership of the panel was invited on a voluntary basis and\nparticipation confirmed because of active research interests in the focus area. For the\ndiscussion session, each panel member presented a brief summary of their experience and\nsupporting research, then concluded with a question about a particular aspect of gender\ndifference and the implications for learning design. These questions provided the focus for\nsmall group discussions that allowed all participants to contribute their opinions and\nexperience. The presenters' research summaries and the issues reported back by the groups\nform the basis of the case now presented. There is a particular focus on access and literacy\nissues, issues of student behaviour and cultural issues.\nAccess and literacy issues\nEarly CSL research found that women were disadvantaged by lower levels of computer\nliteracy, access to technology and confidence in its use, and that girls were both under-\nrepresented and lower achievers in maths, science and technology subjects at school\n(Weinman and Cain, 1999). These findings were open to challenge at the time (Kleinfeld,\n1998), and more recent studies suggest that this is, to some extent, a disappearing problem,\nso that it should now be possible to examine differences that persist when imbalances due\nto access and literacy levels are removed.\nA ten-year survey of IT literacy at university entrance\nData have been gathered about general levels of computer literacy among entry-level\nundergraduate students at the University of Edinburgh over the past ten years. The\nmethod of collection is a brief, self-report questionnaire administered through the enrol-\nment process, and thus relatively high response rates (60-80 per cent of intake) have been\nobtained. The survey is believed to provide a representative example of how levels of\naccess, attitudes and expectations about computer use have shifted over the years.\nIn the early years of the survey, gender was found to be a powerful predictor of the\nresponses that students gave. In all areas of the questionnaire, gender differences were\npresent and highly significant. Women reported themselves as less likely to own computing\nequipment, believed themselves to be less experienced than their male colleagues in IT-\nrelated skills, and were generally less positive in the attitudes they expressed towards the\nimportance and relevance of IT to their academic studies and future careers. In the early\n1990s, some of these differences were clearly related to patterns of recruitment into the\nvarious faculties of the University, and the responses were in some measure based on\n'genuine' differences in the relevance of IT to academic disciplines. For example, women\nwere more likely to be joining the Faculties of Arts and Social Sciences than Science and\nEngineering. Rightly or wrongly, at that time skills in computing and IT were widely seen\nas being more relevant to the sciences than the humanities. Over the passage of the decade,\npatterns of enrolment within the faculties and attitudes to IT have changed in interesting\nways. While gender differences have not disappeared entirely, a definite shift is discernible.\nQuestions about ownership of computing equipment in the 1999 survey (N = 4360\nrespondents, 75 per cent of intake) showed that women were still less likely than men to\n34\nAur-J Volume 10 Number I\nown a computer (see Figure 1). The data show that ownership of a personal computer is\nstill likely to be driven, to a significant extent, by its use for the playing of games, and this\nis still more likely to be the preserve of men than women.\nThe most striking change in gender difference over the period can be seen in the responses\nto two questions that have been asked in identical form since the early days of the survey.\nNewly arriving undergraduates are asked to speculate about the frequency with which they\nwill be expected to make use of computing technologies, and the importance which these\ntechnologies will have for their studies. In the early 1990s these questions provoked marked\nand consistent differences in response between male and female students. Over the decade\nthese differences have gradually and completely disappeared (see Figure 2). These\nquestions call for objective judgements by the students about the importance and relevance\nof the technologies rather than asking them to rate their personal relationship with the\ntechnologies. Male and female students have reached a point of agreement about the\nimportance of computer technology in their work and study which augurs well for equity\nin applications of computers in teaching and learning.\nFigure I: Ownership of, access to, and plans to buy, computing equipment for studies\nComputer use patterns over the period show a marked upturn in the number of students\nexpressing themselves as 'very confident' in their ability to use electronic mail and Web-\nbrowsing applications. This may be explained by the changing significance of these two\nareas and the gender difference in confidence in these areas shows a closing gap between\nmale and female students. The proportional increase in those describing themselves as\n'very confident' proved to be greater among the women than among the men.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nCathy Gunn et a\\ Gender issues in computer-supported learning\nfigure 2: Percentage of the group responding either'important'or'vital'to the question 'How important\ndo you think that computers will be to your university studies?\"\nIt may be argued that women's expressed interests in computers are increasingly positive as\na result of the technology's increasing pragmatic significance. This point is summed up in a\nrecent article in the New York Times:\nGrown-ups' angst over digital gender gap looks quaintly irrelevant now that teenage\ngirls are addicted to instant messaging and the majority of Internet users in the States\nare female. Girls had no trouble adapting to computers once the machines did\nsomething that interested them. (New York Times, 5 August 2001)\nThe assumption that gender-based inequity in terms of access and computer literacy is a\ndisappearing problem is borne out by the findings of this study along with other research\nand reports from various sources across the western world. The focus of attention now\nturns to the differences that persist in this 'more equal' environment and possible\ninterpretations of their impact.\nDisadvantaged or just different?\nOnce male and female students are more or less equal in terms of access and literacy,\nexperience shows that gender-based social relationships, interaction styles and inequities\nthat exist in traditional learning situations correspond fairly closely to those found in CSL\nenvironments (Herring, 1993). These evidence-based assumptions contradict more opti-\nmistic claims that technology is gender-neutral and that it provides a democratic and equal\nenvironment.\n36\nALT-J Volume 10 Number I\nA number of researchers have identified common differences in the behaviour of male and\nfemale students in CSL environments (Richardson and French, 2001; We, 1993; Everts,\n1998; Barrett and Lally, 1999). These differences include self-reported levels of confidence\nin ability to work successfully with technology, use of support systems and patterns of\ninteraction. At a deeper level of analysis, studies of dialogue in CMC consistently reveal\ngender differences in styles of participation and contribution. Generally speaking, women\ntalk less, contribute less frequently, do not receive positive feedback to their contributions\nand do not appeal to the same sources of support as their male counterparts (Richardson\nand French, 2001; Herring, 1993). However, there is some debate over whether these issues\nconstitute disadvantage or simply differences in interaction styles. There is evidence of\nmale behaviour patterns that could be described as dominant in discussion areas (Herring,\n1994) and a notable tendency for men to espouse more confidence in their general\ncapabilities in CSL environments than do women. However, there is no evidence that this\nleads to better performance or learning outcomes and some research has found the\nopposite to be true (Richardson and French, 2001; McSporran and Young, 2001). Two\ncase studies will now be presented in order to demonstrate how similar courses offered in\ndifferent locations, the UK and New Zealand, reached this conclusion. The case studies\ninvolve tertiary-level IT modules with a significant degree of flexibility in study mode and\nmethod because of the mixed-mode teaching approach of CSL environments.\nCase Study I:Electronic Information Services\nThis case study involves a cohort of Information Technology (IT) undergraduates taking a\nfirst-year module called 'Electronic Information Services' (EIS) offered by the Information\nSystems Institute at the University of Salford in 1999 (see Richardson and French, 2001\nfor a fuller report). Whilst the course materials were presented mainly online, students\nattended some lectures and had access to paper-based materials. From a class of 140, 70\nper cent of the students were male.\nThe course designers were well aware of gender differences in attitudes to technology.\nRecent research showed a decline in women taking IT subjects at university (Siann, 1997),\nand that the IT industry in the UK was male-orientated with women representing just 22\nper cent of those in the profession (NCET, 1996). The claims that men have the monopoly\non technology (Wajcman, 1991) and that women may even be excluded from its use by\nvirtue of its design and function (Griffiths, 1985) are important issues to confront when\nusing technology in learning. Given this background there was some concern that women\nmight even shun the use of computers in learning.\nThe research process\nThe study was carried out using formative and summative questionnaires to collect quant-\nitative and qualitative data. A number of meetings with focus groups also took place.\nFurther information was gleaned from the experiences of the lecturer and notes kept in the\nform of a diary. The research focused on gender issues in the following key areas:\nFlexibility and access\nThe study showed that all students appreciated the flexibility of the module and liked to be\nable to work at their own pace. All students used computers at the university. Most also\nhad access to computers in the home, although females reported more problems with\naccess such as having to share the computer with other family members or friends. Several\n37\nCathy Gunn et al Gender issues in computer-supported learning\nfemales reported that they did not have priority access to the computer in the home,\nwhereas none of the males reported this. Kirkup and Abbot (1997) found that female\nstudents regarded a computer in the home as a family resource and did not see their studies\nas a reason for priority access. This situation is common to other studies and may warrant\nfurther investigation.\nConfidence\nAll students used a mix of online and paper-based materials. Whereas males were very\nconfident that they would enjoy using the online materials, several women stated they were\napprehensive about using the materials and about their overall ability in the technical\naspects of the course, that is, designing Web pages.\nApproaches to learning\nGender differences emerged in learning. The female students spent much more time\npreparing for the module. This could be because of their general lack of confidence. The\nfrequency with which students studied at home differed according to gender; whilst most\nmales reported mainly working between the hours of 4 and 8 p.m., the majority of women\nstudied later in the evening, fitting study around other commitments such as family.\nSupport\nGender differences emerged in the support mechanisms utilized by students. Women\nmainly emailed the lecturer and friends whilst males reported contact with their peers at\nUniversity as well. No women seemed to use this method of support and this raised the\nissue of whether this type of learning isolated female students. There is conflicting evidence\non this subject. Some research has found that women, especially those with family\ncommitments, embrace the flexibility in learning schedules and attendance requirements\nwhich online learning brings (Von Prummer, 1994). Parallel research has produced con-\nflicting evidence suggesting that women are 'social learners' and prefer traditional learning\nover the need to adapt to another imposed model such as online learning (Von Prummer,\n1994; Kirkup and Abbot, 1997). The researchers in this case felt that this could be another\nimportant issue for further study.\nLearning outcomes\nThe confidence that the males expressed and the apprehension of many of the women were\nnot substantially reflected in the grades they achieved. The males achieved slightly higher\ngrades than the women as a whole, on what might be deemed the more technical aspect of\nthe module (designing Web pages). Overall, however, the women's marks were con-\ncentrated at the top end of the grades for all of the .assessed work.\nImplications for learning with technology\nFrom this research it can be concluded that the online learning experience may well be\ndifferent for males and females. The females in this study seemed to have less confidence\nthan their male counterparts and less guaranteed access to technology. In order to ensure\nequality, the needs are to improve access, make sure learners are not isolated and find ways\nof instilling confidence in some of the female students. Social issues such as ownership of\ntechnology are at the forefront of research and need further discussion. The issues are\ncomplex and, as the other studies in this paper demonstrate, there is much conflicting\nevidence.\n38\nAn-] Volume 10 Number I\nCase study 2: Interactive Web Design\nResearch conducted in a similar context in a New Zealand tertiary institution found that\nfemale students performed consistently better than males in online courses (McSporran,\nDewstow and Young, 1999; McSporran and Young, 2001). A course in Interactive Web\nDesign enrols 70-100 students per semester and options are available to complete the\ncourse entirely online or to attend weekly classroom sessions in addition to independent\nstudy. The course structure and assessment have remained more or less the same over the\nthree-year period of the study and involve:\n\u2022 a balance of theory and practical exercises;\n\u2022 self-test quizzes;\n\u2022 access to readings, URLs and FAQs;\n\u2022 constant feedback from tutors;\n\u2022 a research project requiring team collaboration and report preparation;\n\u2022 a Website development assignment and a final exam.\nKnowledge of contemporary research findings together with the benefits of past\nexperience provided the basis for initial assumptions that female students might perform\nbetter on the research assignment because it involved communication and teamwork, while\nmales may do better on the technical task of Website development. However, these\nassumptions proved to be unfounded as the female students performed consistently better\nthan males on both tasks. Analysis of course-entry questionnaires showed that females\nrated themselves less competent with Internet skills and experience at the outset, a\nsituation that is reflected in the findings of other research (Yates, 1992). Analysis of\nparticipation in online activities recorded by the course management system server then\nraised the possibility that male students may be overconfident in their ability and think\nthey do not have to put in as much effort to meet the course requirements (see Table 1).\nThis analysis revealed the following characteristics of male student behaviour:\n\u2022 greater non-submission of a complete assignment;\n\u2022 greater non-completion of all parts of each assignment;\n\u2022 lower number of online quiz attempts;\n\u2022 lower course Website page views;\n\u2022 lower bulletin board participation.\nAlthough these figures are relatively crude measures of cause and effect regarding\nperformance levels, the tentative conclusion is that the course works well for women and\nmature students, while the younger male students appear to need more motivation and\ndiscipline than weekly classroom sessions currently provide. The reasons for better\nperformance of women, and in this case mature students, are believed to include stronger\nmotivation to succeed, greater ability to work independently and self-manage multi-tasking\nlives. These case-specific findings are further supported by a Canadian study that reports\nopportunities for communication and participation in course-related activities being\n39\nCathy Gunn et al Gender issues in computer-supported learning\nSemester Female % Male%\nQuiz attempts\nNo of quizzes attempted 11.4 7.4\nNever attempted a quiz 4.0 20.0\nBulletin Board Participation\nPosts read 38.5 16.2\nPosts made 4.3 2.6\nFemale (n) Male (n)\nTotal page views 416.9 249.2-\nTable I: System data of male and female student participation in CSL elements\nenhanced for women when they do not have to enter 'inhospitable' environments such as\ncomputer labs (Chegwidden, 2000).\nIt seems then, that although a significant body of literature suggests that suitable\neducational models are currently not widely used to promote women-friendly CSL\nenvironments, some situations are not particularly male-friendly either. The challenge is to\nfind solutions that offer equal opportunities to all students. The questions that this raises\nare what characteristics make learning environments friendly to both male and female\nstudents, and how can opportunities to participate and succeed be enhanced for all. Before\npresenting the solutions proposed by the discussion groups, the impact of culture on\ngender differences is considered worthy of mention.\nCultural impact on gender relations\nA review of international literature (notably from the US, Europe and Australasia) on\ngender, identity and performance issues in CSL environments raises questions about how\nfar the differences are culturally determined (Barrett and Lally, 1999; Eubanks, 2000).\nSome variation may be attributable to the style of report or the nature of the gender\nimbalance in particular situations. However, it may also be the case that culturally based\nmetaphors significantly influence perceptions of technology environments, their suitability\nfor different groups, the values they reflect and the behaviour that is acceptable within their\nconfines.\nThe term 'cyberspace' itself has some significance in a discussion of cultural influence on\ngender issues. The concept of cyberspace has its origins in a science fiction work,\nNeuromancer, published by Gibson in 1984. Gibson's cyberspace is a female region used\nand controlled by men; it is also highly sexualized. Women in this region are simply\nresources, not active agents or users of technology. So the very metaphor that is used to\ndefine the online 'space' in which students now interact has its roots in a very unequal\nsociety.\nIn contemporary cultures, there do appear to be differences that could be attributed to the\nsociocultural contexts in which educational experiences are studied and reported.\n40\nALT-J Volume 10 Number I\nPublished studies from the southern US identify dominant and sometimes even deviant\nbehaviour among males (Herring, 1994; Blumenstyk, 1997; Blum, 1999 Herring, 1999).\nFor example, Blum found that males talk more and interpreted this as controlling\nbehaviour, noted that they used different tones, ones of arrogance and certainty that she\ninterpreted as intimidating to women, and asked fewer questions which implied that they\nhad more knowledge. She concluded that interactions in CMC reflect those of face-to-face\nculture. Although the findings of this study could be interpreted quite differently and the\nmethodology questioned because of the small sample used for a study that claims\ngeneralizable results, the fact that the author made these interpretations may say something\nabout the culture in which she works. Herring reported construction and maintenance of\nasymmetrical gender\/power dynamics and exposed blatant double standards in freedom of\nspeech 'rhetoric' (Herring, 1999).\nMoving to a different cultural environment, Barrett and Lally (1999) present a case study\nfrom the UK in which male and female students played notably different roles:\n\u2022 males talk more;\n\u2022 meta\/cognitive content was the same;\n\u2022 social content was higher for males;\n\u2022 interaction was higher for females;\n\u2022 only females had persistent access problems.\nAlthough some findings are common with the US studies, the researchers do not draw\nconclusions about women being disadvantaged. Rather they seek to explore the meaning of\nthese differences in terms of perceived user friendliness of the environment and its impact\non student performance.\nIn the other cultural environments covered by this study, requests for participation in this\nresearch from Australian academics resulted in expression of the opinion that 'gender is\nsimply not an issue worthy of attention in this country'. In New Zealand, the only research\navailable suggests that women are performing better than their male counterparts,\nalthough this may reflect a lack of investigation (Gunn and Barnett, 2001) and published\nresearch rather than a difference in what appears to be the norm elsewhere. The conclusion\nhere is that broader aspects of local culture may indeed be reflected in the interaction styles\nof students in CSL environments. To a great extent, these issues go beyond the scope of\ninfluence of educational designers although they should be afforded due consideration in\nlearning design.\nConclusions and recommendations\nConsensus reached by the discussion groups at ALT-C was that the differences identified by\nthe presenters and supported by contemporary research exist in most western world\neducational environments and present significant challenges to educators using new\ntechnologies in teaching. However, a range of interpretations of both the underlying\ncauses and the implications of these differences is possible. The critical issue is to develop\nwidely applicable solutions rather than conducting more in-depth research into the causes.\n41\nCathy Gunn et a\\ Gender issues in computer-supported learning\nIt was agreed that inequality in levels of access and computer literacy among student\npopulations are disappearing problems, and that male and female users generally take\ndifferent approaches to the use of technology, that is, exploratory and developmental\nversus practical and instrumental. This inherent difference in approach sparked a debate\nabout whether some aspects of gender are in fact attributable to sociocultural construction\nor to biological difference. Regardless of the outcome of that particular debate, the\nimplications for CSL designers are that they have to accommodate a range of approaches\nto the use of technology and design learning environments that do not implicitly favour\nany particular approach. This is considered to require a degree of flexibility that many\nonline environments currently do not include. For example, educationally focused games\nand challenges may be more appealing to a typically competitive male orientation, while\ncommunicative and collaborative activities may appeal more to typical female styles. The\nusefulness of these types of activities will depend on suitability to discipline and subject-\nrelated learning objectives as well as to gender-typical approaches.\nA critical issue in encouraging equal participation by both genders may be the levels and\ntypes of support provided for learners. For example, good moderation in discussions can\nhelp to ensure equal and appropriate levels of participation. Inclusion of opportunities for\nself-assessment during a course can support self-monitoring of performance to ensure that\nespoused confidence is backed up by the ability to attain high performance levels with or\nwithout specifically requested support. The issue of confidence is perceived to be a\nparticular challenge for male students who are considered less likely to ask for assistance as\nwell as less likely to recognize the need to participate in all course-related activities and\npreparations for assessment. It was also noted, however, that in a context characterized by\nrapid change in so many areas - technology, educational theories, design of learning\nenvironments, student demographics and professional requirements - these issues are\ndynamic and in need of constant reappraisal. Issues of gender should not be treated in\nisolation from other factors such as learning styles, educational backgrounds and\ncapabilities.\nA more general point was also raised about computer-based course management systems\nin their current incarnation being predominantly designed to support didactic rather than\nconstructive learning experiences. This is one more issue that needs to be addressed in the\ndesign of learning environments that offer equal opportunities to all students. It was\ngenerally concluded that gender is just one of many areas of focus for research and\ndevelopment of effective CSL environments and activities.\nReferences\nAmerican Association of University Women Educational Foundation (1998), Gender Gaps:\nWhere Schools Still Fail Our Children, Washington DC: AAUWEF.\nBarrett, E. and Lally, V.
