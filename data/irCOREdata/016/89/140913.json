As most of the predictors used have been very specific, in that they probably \nare causally related to only a subset of crashes, effect sizes have generally been small. \nOne set of predictors that have received little attention is health-related ones. Among \nthose found to be associated with traffic crash record are obesity (Yamamoto, \nAkashiba, Kosaka, Ito & Horie, 2000), sleep apnoea (e.g., Findley, Unverzagt & \nSuratt, 1988; Young, Blustein, Finn & Palta, 1997; Barb\u00e9 et al, 1998), and possibly \nexercise (see the review by Taylor & Dorn, 2006; Taylor & Dorn, 2008). For medical \ncondition and treatment variables, correlations are in general very small, but reliable \neffects seem to have been found for diabetes (Cox et al., 2003), epilepsy (Lings, 2001) \nand various medications (Leveille, Buchner, Koepsell, McCloskey, Wolf & Wagner, \n1994; Hemmelgarn, Suissa, Huang, Boivin & Pinard, 1997; and possibly Lagarde, \nChastang, Lafont, Coeuret-Pellicer & Chiron, 2005, although it was uncertain whether \nthe effects were due to health problems as such or the medications to treat the \nailments). \nThe interesting aspect of the previous research in the use of  health-\nrelated variables as predictors of crash involvement is that they should all be \nassociated with absence from work. As yet, research to show a link between \nabsenteeism and traffic crash involvement for professional drivers (who have a higher \nexposure to crash risk) has not been demonstrated previously.. Furthermore, if the \nwide ranging health conditions previously studied yield an effect on crashes as well as \n 4 \nabsence, then the sum should be much larger than these variables individually. It is \ntherefore possible that absence from work may be a good predictor of traffic crash \ninvolvement.  \nBearing in mind that absence from work is in itself an unwanted \nbehaviour for companies, a link between absence and at-work crashes for professional \ndrivers could be important information for managing at-work road risk.  \nOver fifty years ago,  similar research on workplace injuries and \nabsenteeism has been reported for industrial workers (Farmer & Chambers, 1926; \n1929), but can be suspected to be somewhat inflated, due to absences being caused by \nthe injuries sustained (see Verrier & Chevalier, 2007). However, in heavy vehicle \n(>10 tons) driver populations, such an effect is unlikely, due to the protection offered \nto the driver by the weight and sturdiness of such vehicles. This is especially true for \nbus drivers in city areas, where speeds are low; injuries to drivers are extremely rare \n(af W\u00e5hlberg, 2002). Also, bus drivers have high levels of work-related health \nproblems (for reviews, see Long & Perry, 1985; Kompier & Di Martino, 1995; Tse, \nFlin & Mearns, 2006), making them a good population to study the proposed effect.. \nThe present study therefore set out to investigate whether absence from work is \nassociated with bus crashes for at work bus drivers. Of empirical interest is the notion \nof broad variables being better crash predictors than specific ones but this is beyond \nthe scope of the present study. \n \n \n \nMethod \nSamples \n 5 \nThree sets of bus driver data were used for the present study; two from a \nmajor UK bus company, and one from a small bus company in Sweden; Gamla \nUppsalabuss (GUB). Data on descriptive variables for these samples are shown in \nTables 1 and 2. \nIn the UK, the operators in sample 1 were newly hired and had taken \npart in a simulator-based study which required their crash and absence data to be \ncollected for a period of 12 months after they began operational driving (see Dorn, \nStephen & af W\u00e5hlberg, in press). Therefore, these data had differing starting points \nand were not for the same time period for individual drivers.. Traffic crash data were \navailable for every three months of operational driving for each of the drivers. \nSample 2 consisted of bus drivers from two different locations within \nthe UK; London and the North West of England, including North Wales and \nManchester. Some operational and situational differences can be noted between these \ntwo groups; the London area has heavier traffic, more modern vehicles (and fewer \ndifferent types), more CCTV surveillance on the vehicle, no fares collection by the \ndrivers, and more supervision from managers. Data for these groups were added \ntogether across both samples due to small Ns. Both UK samples consisted of full time \ndrivers only. \nFor the Swedish sample, all drivers who had worked on full time \nschedules from 1999 to 2005 (as identified by their employee numbers) were included \nin the study, apart from those who worked less than ten hours in any year (about two \nstandard deviations from the mean for each year). Gamla Uppsalabuss (GUB) run all \nintra-city bus routes of Uppsala, the fourth largest town of Sweden, and has about 180 \nbuses and 350 drivers at any time. A substantial number of the drivers work part time. \nDescriptive data for one year for the Swedish sample are shown in Table 2. \n 6 \n \nTables 1-2 about here \n \n \nData \nFor the UK samples, absence (number of days off work) and crash data \nwere available from the employer for one year for sample 1 and 6 months for sample \n2. All incidents resulting in damage and\/or injury involving the bus are reported by \nthe drivers, and culpability for these (including falls in the bus) are determined by the \ndriver's manager and an insurance team, taking in such information as the driver's \nreport, photographs, witness reports etc. In the present study, two crash variables were \nused (All crashes and Culpable crashes) to test the hypothesis that absenteeism is \nassociated with crashes. Theoretically, only crashes that the drivers have had some \npart in causing should be used as a criterion, as non-culpable incidents cannot be \npredicted (af W\u00e5hlberg, 2008a; 2008b; af W\u00e5hlberg & Dorn, 2007; 2009).  \nHowever, as it has been shown that the criterion used by this bus company to \ndetermine responsibility is somewhat too lenient (af W\u00e5hlberg & Dorn, 2007). This \nmeans that the \u2018culpable only\u2019 variable will exclude a number of incidents that should \nrightly have been included, while the \u2018All\u2019 variable includes about 30 percent of \nincidents that are not the bus driver\u2019s fault and should therefore be excluded. As it \nwas not possible to determine which crashes should have been excluded, both \nvariables were included as the optimal dependent variable would be somewhere in \nbetween these variables. \nFor the Swedish drivers, hours actually worked and crash data were \navailable for the period 1999-2005. Regarding culpability for crashes, the criterion \n 7 \nused for categorization had been shown to be approximately correct, classifying about \n70 percent of crashes as at least partly the fault of the bus driver (af W\u00e5hlberg & \nDorn, 2007). Therefore, only one incident variable (including injuries and hitting \nanimals) was used; culpable crashes. Further descriptions of the bus company and \ntheir incident data can be found in af W\u00e5hlberg (2002). \n \n \nStatistical methods \nThe main aim of the study was to estimate the strength of the association \nbetween absence and traffic crashes. This can be expressed with many statistical \nmethods, but Pearson correlation was chosen because it can be directly converted into \npercent explained variance, which is closely related to how well drivers can be \nclassified into correct groups for crash involvement. The crash data used was not \nnormally distributed, but this restricted variance only has the effect of limiting the size \nof the correlations (Glass & Hopkins, 1996). However, this effect is small; even when \ncrash data with very restricted variance is used, the results follow a pattern that does \nnot indicate that the correlations shrink faster than the mean of the samples used (af \nW\u00e5hlberg & Dorn, 2009). Another indication of the robustness of the Pearson \ncorrelation against violations of its assumptions is that log transformation against \nskewness has no impact (Avolio, Kroeck & Panek, 1985). Also, as shown by Gebers \n(1997), what statistical method is used has little impact upon the final result, in terms \nof explanatory power. \nAs a complimentary analysis, independent t-tests were used, to bring out \npossible non-linear effects, where it was possible to dichotomize data in a meaningful \n 8 \nway. ANOVA-type tests could not be used, as the crashes per hour variable was \ncontinuous. \n \nAnalyses \nThe analysis performed involved correlations being run between number \nof crashes for a specified time period and number of absence days for the same time \nperiod. All drivers were all on full-time schedules, and therefore, in principle, equally \nexposed to risk of crash involvement, although there could exist differences in crash \nrisk between different routes or schedules. However, such differences have been \nshown to be very small (H\u00e4kkinen, 1958). \nConversely, full time drivers who are absent from work and therefore \noperational driving have a lower risk exposure directly related to their amount of \nabsence. Crashes per time period are therefore not a truly equivalent outcome measure \nfor these drivers. Therefore, the number of crashes per day or hour actually worked \nwas computed to control for the difference in risk exposure due to absenteeism. For \nthe UK drivers, hours worked were estimated by subtracting their absences from their \nexpected number of working days and the remainder was used as the denominator for \nthe number of crashes per day ratio calculation. For the Swedish sample, only hours \nactually worked were available. Although it was not known exactly how many hours \nthey were expected to work, the normal Swedish working year is around 1800 hours, \nwhich was used as the expected number. The expectation was that absence would \ncorrelate somewhat more strongly with this variable, as compared with the crashes per \nyear variable, because the latter would not be held constant for exposure.  \n \n \n 9 \nResults \nUK sample 1 \nFirst, the number crashes for the whole time period and the number of \ncrashes per actual working day\n1\n were correlated with absence, as shown in Table 3. \nAs data was available for four different, cumulative time periods from the drivers\u2019 \nstart of employment and correlations were run for all of these time periods.  It can be \nnoted that only for the shortest time period was there an association of any size \nbetween the variables of interest. \nOne extreme outlier for absenteeism was deleted from one calculation, and several \nmore could have been excluded, if the normal statistical criterion of two standard \ndeviations from the mean had been used. However, analyses determined that these \ndeviating cases did not have any discernible effect on the results. \n \nTables 3-4 about here \n \n \nUK sample 2 \nThe analysis was similar to that of sample 1, although restricted to one \ntime period only. The results are shown in Table 4. As expected, the correlations for \ncrashes per day were stronger than the ones for crashes per year, as was the case for \nall but one comparison in sample 1. When the same analyses were run for the sub-\ngroups of this sample (different areas in the UK) results were very similar. \n \nSwedish sample \n                                                          \n1\n Accidents per day=\nabsenceysExpectedda\nntsNoofaccide\n \n 10 \nFirst, the correlations between hours worked in different years were \ncomputed (see Table 5). From these results, it could be gleaned that there was a strong \ntendency for (full-time) drivers to work a certain number of hours consistently over \ntime. This can be interpreted as evidence that absent prone drivers tend to be off work \nsick over extended time periods, i.e. in other words, absenteeism is a fairly stable \ndisposition within individual drivers (see further the discussion). \nThe correlations between absence and number of crashes and crashes \nper hour worked for 1999-2005 was -.050 and .089, respectively (N=150, p>.05). \nThereafter, absence was dichotomized into the groups who worked more and less than \n10 800 hours in the time period studied. The not-absent group had 0.111 crashes per \n1000 hours, while the absent group had 0.145. Whilst on the face of it, this appears to \nbe a substantial difference between the groups, the groupswere not significantly \ndifferent from each other at p<.05 (independent t-test, t=1.33). However, close \ninspection of the data revealed that there were a number of drivers who had worked \nvery few hours, and in conjunction with the very low risk of crash for this company \n(see Table 2), it could be suspected that these results were indicative of a real effect \nthat was suppressed due to the number of cases = of drivers driving very little and \nhaving had no crashes. For this reason, the drivers with no crashes were excluded, and \nthe correlations re-run. This method yielded associations of .037 and .279 (N=95, \np<.01) with absence. \n \nTable 5 about here \n \n \nDiscussion \n 11 \nThe present study would seem to lend some tentative support to the \nhypothesis of absence behaviour as a predictor of traffic crashes amongst professional \ndrivers, but more evidence is required. However, as the crash variable has low \nstatistical power, further research would require larger samples. \nThe first UK sample results were hard to interpret, as the effect at three \nmonths was apparently carried by those who thereafter left the company (no \ncorrelation was present at three months if the sample was restricted to those who \nremained with the company). Staplin and Gish (2005) reported that drivers who \nchange jobs frequently have higher crash risks, and in the light of their research, the \npresent findings would seem to be reasonable. It could be argued that the UK sample \nconfirmed the hypothesis in all instances but one; the correlation between absenteeism \nand crashes increased when these were calculated by working day instead of by year, \nas similarly (but more strongly) was the case in sample 2 from the UK. \nThe present data showed that it was not very likely that drivers had been \ninjured and\/or shocked in crashes and thereafter been on sickness leave. Buses are \nheavy and sturdy vehicles, which protect their occupants well. Also, for the Swedish \ndata, almost all driving takes place in 30 and 50 km\/h speed limit zones, and injuries \nconstitutes less than ten percent of incidents (af W\u00e5hlberg, 2002), and the injuries \nsustained are usually to passengers. Therefore, it seems unlikely that absence could be \ncaused by crashes in bus driver populations.  \nIt is, in principle, possible that some of the UK results were due to a \nthird variable; unequal risk and stress exposure between routes. However, drivers are \nnot allocated systematically to the same routes and all drivers have a similar chance of \nbeing exposed to the routes with higher risk. This is potential effect is not possible for \nthe Swedish drivers, as they all drove the majority of routes.  \n 12 \nThe association between absence and traffic crashes, if reliably \nconfirmed in future research, could be used by fleet-based companies to improve \nsafety at work. Drivers who are often absent are not only an organizational cost \nincluding driver substitution and turnover, but also as safety hazards. There are thus \nmany reasons for targeting such drivers with remedial action, especially to promote a \nhealthier lifestyle and general good health.  \nWithin traffic research, it has sometimes been reported that mileage is \ncurvilinearly related to crashes (e.g., Maycock, 1996), i.e. when exposure is very high, \ncrashes hardly increase at all. This has usually been interpreted as an experience \neffect, with increased driving causing higher skill and crash avoidance. However, this \neffect may just as well be due to the opposite mechanism, with less proficient drivers \ndriving less, as indicated in the present study. It could therefore be the case that \nexposure is actually fairly linearly associated with crashes, and the apparent \ncurvilinearity is caused to some degree by the opposing effect of high-absence drivers \nhaving more crashes and driving less. This explanation is of course more viable for \nprofessional samples, but it is possible that such a mechanism is at work amongst \nprivate driver populations too. After all, a proportion of our driving is commuting to \nand from work, and people who are sick probably abstain somewhat from driving \nprivately as well. To test this proposition, studies are needed on the driving habits of \npeople in relation to their sickness and absences from work. The reported \ncurvilinearity of crashes versus mileage might also be due to artifacts created by the \nself-report method usually used in such studies (Staplin, Gish & Joyce, 2008). \n \nThe phenomenon of absenteeism from work is a lively research area in \nits own right, and would seem to be fairly well developed (for a review, see Johns, \n 13 \n2003). In this research, it would seem that it has been implicitly assumed that it is the \ncrashes that cause long-term absences (e.g., Ose, 2005). The present hypothesis and \nresults, however, would seem to lend a new perspective to this endeavor. Future \nresearch might focus on performing a meta-analysis to sort studies into those that \nhave used specific and general variables (the latter subsuming the former), may find \nthat the associations are stronger for the general variables. \n \n \n \nAcknowledgement \nThe data used in this paper had been generously made available by a major UK bus company and \nGamla Uppsalabuss. \n \n \nReferences \nArthur, W., Jr., Barrett, G.
