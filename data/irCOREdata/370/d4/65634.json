A \nnumber of papers have heralded this emergence but the vast majority are theoretical \nand concerned with how EBP research could be practised. This paper reflects upon \nthe author\u2019s experiences of identifying and reviewing evidence on the effectiveness of \nlabour market interventions aimed at people with a disability or a chronic illness, to \ndemonstrate some of the methodological challenges and practical problems that arise \nfrom the actual conduct of EBP research. \n \nIntroduction \nThe role of evidence in policy making has increasingly been emphasised by the \ncurrent government (Davies and Smith, 1999; Walker, 2000; Boaz et al, 2002; \nSolesbury, 2002). For example, the ascendancy of an evidence rhetoric is apparent in \ngovernment reports such as the 1999 White Paper on Modernising government \n(Cabinet Office, 1999) and the 2000 Performance and Innovation Unit report Adding \nit up (Cabinet Office, 2000), and also within more specific policy reviews such as the \n1998 Acheson Independent Inquiry into Health Inequalities (Acheson et al, 1998). \nThis interest in evidence has been reflected in an upsurge in public funding for \nevidence-based policy (EBP) research (Packwood, 2002) alongside the development \nof EBP research centres such as the EPPI centre (http:\/\/eppi.ioe.ac.uk\/) and the \nESRC\u2019s Evidence Network (www.evidencenetwork.org\/). \n \nOne of the key concerns of EBP research is discovering \u2018what works\u2019 (and also \nunderstanding why and for whom \u2018it works\u2019), through the assessment of whether \npolicy interventions, both new and existing, are effective and efficient in achieving \nthe desired policy goal(s) (Davies and Smith, 1999; Macintyre and Petticrew, 2000; \nCampbell Collaboration, 2001). The concern for effectiveness is based on the \nacknowledgement that resources such as time and financing are scarce, and that it is \nimportant to focus them on policies that are the most effective at producing the \n 1\ndesired outcome(s) (Davies and Smith, 1999; Macintyre and Petticrew, 2000; Judge \nand Bauld, 2001). EBP research is intended to provide the \u2018rigorous, replicable, \nrelevant, independent\u2019 and high quality information required to form an \u2018evidence \nbase\u2019 that can be used by policy makers to inform their decisions about the \ndevelopment and implementation of public policy. \n \nBOX 1 \n \nEBP\u2019s concern with effectiveness, and its favoured methodological approach \u2013 the \nsystematic review (see Box 1) \u2013 have their major roots in evidence-based medicine \n(Klein, 2000; Macintyre and Petticrew, 2000; Campbell Collaboration, 2001; \nMacintyre et al, 2001; Boaz et al, 2002; Solesbury, 2002), a discipline that has long \nbeen practised in the field of clinical research as a way of gaining information about \nthe effectiveness of different treatments and interventions. However, unlike evidence-\nbased medicine, in which the majority of interventions under consideration tend to be \nsingular, easily identifiable, and amenable to isolation and the experimental method \n(Cochrane Collaboration, 2001), the public policy interventions that EBP research \naddresses are likely to be multiple, hard to distinguish and immersed within a \ncomplex social, political and cultural context (Whitehead et al, 2000; Pawson, 2001b; \nJudge and Mackenzie, 2002). Consequently, while the original attractions of \nsystematic review such as its rigour, comprehensiveness and replicability (Mulrow, \n1994; Chalmers and Altman, 1995; Davies and Crombie, 1998; Macintyre and \nPetticrew, 2000; Glasziou et al, 2001) remain, or indeed become enhanced, their \noperationalisation within the policy field is far more problematic. \n \nThe practical issues surrounding the implementation of the systematic review method \nin the policy sphere have not yet been fully addressed by the emerging literature on \nEBP research. The majority of publications are theoretical and concerned with how \nEBP research could be practised; they do not discuss the methodological challenges \nand practical problems that arise from its actual conduct (Klein, 2000; Pawson, \n2001a, 2001b; Petticrew, 2001; Boaz et al, 2002; Packwood, 2002; Sanderson, 2002; \nSolesbury, 2002; Young et al, 2002; Wallace et al, 2004). This has given rise to the \nimpression that such research is straightforward and uncomplicated, requiring only \nthe technical application of the methodology in order to get the desired results. The \n 2\nreality can be very different. This paper reflects on EBP research by the author on the \neffectiveness of labour market interventions aimed at people with a disability or a \nchronic illness (see Box 2), to demonstrate some of the methodological and practical \nchallenges posed by the analysis of public policy interventions: policy definition; \npolicy comparability; policy isolation and evaluation context; evidence location; and \nevidence design. \n \nBOX 2 \n \nPolicy Definition \nTraditionally, the systematic review method requires the review question to be \nnarrow, focused, and concerned with a very limited number of interventions and \noutcomes (Chalmers and Altman, 1995; Davies and Crombie, 1998; Campbell \nCollaboration, 2001; Glasziou et al, 2001; NHS CRD, 2001; Petticrew, 2001). This is \nintended to draw boundaries around the review and is used to determine the selection \nof relevant studies for inclusion (Davies and Crombie, 1998). However, public policy \nquestions intrinsically tend to be broad and more open in their remit. For example, \nthey may ask \u2018does a reduction in benefit payments increase the employment rate?\u2019 or \n\u2018what is effective in helping women with disabilities gain employment?\u2019 They are \nrarely narrow and specific in their focus, and they seldom involve one intervention or \nthe influence of only one factor. The use of a very tight or technical formulation for \nthe review will not meet the needs of policy makers because the focus will be too \nrestricted. For example, \u2018how effective are UK anti-discrimination policies on helping \ndisabled and chronically ill people gain employment?\u2019 This review question only \noffers a perspective on the effectiveness of one policy, in one country. It does not \naddress issues of why this policy is or is not effective, or whether similar policies in \nother countries have the same effects. What policy makers really want to know in this \ninstance is which of a given number of policy options for helping disabled people \nback into work are effective, and which is the most effective (Petticrew et al, 2004; \nWhitehead et al, 2004). Formulating a single \u2018tight\u2019 question may be clearly desirable \nfrom a methodological viewpoint, to keep the review manageable by avoiding \nunnecessary relevancy screening and the assessment and comparison of multiple \ninterventions. However, it fails to meet the policy maker\u2019s need. In such \ncircumstances an alternative \u2018policy\u2019 approach will need to be developed in which the \n 3\npolicy question is broken down into its constituent parts, some of which may be \namenable to inquiry and some not. \n \nPolicy Comparability \nRelated to the problem of policy definition is that of policy comparability. There has \nbeen a lack of an evaluative culture surrounding social interventions, particularly in \nthe UK, (Oakley, 1998; 2000) and evidence is not available about the impact of a \nvariety of social policies and interventions. In order to broaden the available evidence \nbase, EBP research often compares similar policies from different countries both in \norder to get a larger quantity of evidence and to see how different styles of \nintervention may have an impact on effectiveness. For example, both the UK and the \nUSA have anti-discrimination legislation in place around disability (the 1995 \nDisability Discrimination Act and the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act) but the \nUK\u2019s legislation is less rigorous and extensive. It is useful for EBP research to \ncompare these two approaches so that a judgement can be made about whether the \nintervention type (anti-discrimination legislation) is effective, which intervention style \nis effective (lenient, strict or both) and which is the more effective (lenient, strict or \nneither). Comparison clearly offers a number of benefits to EBP research (not least as \na substitution for the experimental method (Marsh and Mackie, 1995), but it is not \nwithout its drawbacks: the policy interventions may not be truly comparable because \nof differences in their approach, context (historically, culturally or geographically) \nand goals (Pawson, 2001a; 2001b; 2002). Furthermore, the effectiveness of a policy \nintervention in one setting\/environment does not guarantee that it can be transferred or \nreplicated in another. The effectiveness of a policy may be reliant as much on the \ncontext in which it operates as on its constitution, mechanism and implementation. \n \nPolicy Isolation and Evaluation Context \nThe isolation of the policy and its effects\/effectiveness is a similarly problematic issue \nfor the conduct of EBP research. Policy interventions are deeply contextualised by \ntheir historical, cultural and geographic background, and by the wider policy \nenvironment in which they are implemented. Policies do not work in a vacuum; they \nare put in place within a pre-existing policy context and work alongside, either in a \nsupporting or oppositional role, other policies. It is therefore extremely difficult to \nuntangle the impact of individual interventions. For example, in the UK, the New \n 4\nDeal for Disabled People and the Disabled Person\u2019s Tax Credit were introduced at a \nsimilar time (1998 and 1999 respectively), with the shared goal of improving the \nassistance offered to unemployed disabled people. It is hard to determine with any \ncertainty that perceived outcomes for this population were the result of the New Deal \nintervention (X) or the tax credit (Y) or an entirely different, unnamed intervention \n(Z). The introduction of similar policies targeted at the same groups, in the same \ngeographical areas, in the same time period makes the evaluation of the results of any \none intervention particularly difficult to identify (Walker, 2001). Furthermore, it is \ndifficult to assess whether the claimed effects of a policy intervention would have \nhappened anyway, even if it had not been implemented (Judge, 2001). For example, \nthose New Deal participants who found work might have done so even without the \nhelp of the scheme through, for example, a general rise in the overall employment rate \n(Bambra et al, in press). It is very hard to isolate cause and effect when examining the \neffectiveness of policies at this macro level. \n \nIn a commentary on the rise of EBP under the post-1997 New Labour government, \nWalker (2001) highlights the evaluation context as a further barrier to establishing the \neffects of specific social policy interventions. While New Labour were initially keen \nto pilot and evaluate policies and programmes ahead of implementation, the \nevaluations were often undermined, incomplete or rushed (Walker 2001). This led to a \nlack of clarity in establishing their effectiveness. For example, the New Deal for Lone \nParents (prototype pilots) evaluation was undermined because the policy went \nnationwide during the evaluation period, leading to the possible contamination of the \noriginal control groups. Of more direct relevance to the social intervention focused \nupon in this paper, the evaluations of the New Deal for Disabled People (personal \nadviser pilots) were incomplete and somewhat rushed. Initially, these evaluations \nwere planned to last for a period of two years, and were intended to guide the decision \non whether the policy should be enacted nationally. However, in the event, the \ndecision was taken on the basis of interim results, and the policy expanded after less \nthan one year. Walker comments that the evaluations were further restricted in their \nability to establish the employment and employability outcomes of the intervention \nbecause of a smaller than anticipated sample size and a lower than expected \nprogramme participation rate. \n \n 5\nEvidence Location \nEvidence-based policy seeks to provide evidence about the operation, impact, \noutcomes and effectiveness of public policy interventions. The rationale is that this \nevidence will then be used to inform public policy formulation and implementation \nfor the better in both the present and the future. It is therefore vital that the policy \ninterventions that are researched are policy-relevant and as current as possible: EBP \nresearch needs to address the policy \u2018questions of the day\u2019 such as \u2018how effective is \nthe New Deal for Disabled People?\u2019 or \u2018how effective is the government\u2019s health \ninequalities programme?\u2019 or \u2018do wage subsidies increase the employment rate of \npeople with disabilities?\u2019 Herein lies much of the attraction of EBP research, but it \nalso poses a number of problems for the practical conduct of that research. \n \nThe demand by the policy process for answers to current questions means that the \nevidence base available to the EBP researcher is likely to be partial, limited and \nmainly \u2018grey\u2019, as the primary policy evaluations may not yet have been carried out, let \nalone published in the peer reviewed literature and indexed in electronic databases. \nFor example, in the review of the effectiveness of recent labour market interventions \naimed at people with a disability or a chronic illness (see Box 2), the contemporary \nnature of the review question meant that there were almost no relevant papers within \nthe published and indexed literature, particularly for the employment programmes and \nwork incentive interventions. The majority of the data was located in greyer sources \nsuch as government or policy institute reports, and accessed via web trawling, \npersonal communication and citation follow-up. A similar pattern has also been \nexperienced in the conduct of EBP research with a wider timeframe. For example, in a \nsystematic review on the health effects of housing improvement only six of the 18 \nsources of evidence finally included in the synthesis were located by electronic means \n(Thomson et al, 2001). Similarly, in a systematic review of the health effects of new \nroads only a minority (eight) of the included studies were retrieved from databases, \nwith the vast majority (24) identified by other means (Egan et al, 2003). \n \nThe prevalence of grey sources has an impact on the amount of time needed to \nconduct a review: searching websites, contacting experts in the field, and locating and \naccessing other sources of grey literature is much more time consuming than \nconventional electronic database literature searches. It has the added difficulty of \n 6\nbeing a near endless task that the researcher must at some point decide to stop both for \nresource reasons and to ensure the policy relevancy of the end product \u2013 is the review \nof the evidence still contemporary, is it still a \u2018debate of the day\u2019 or has that debate \nnow moved on?  \n \nAnother problem facing the EBP researcher in identifying policy-relevant evidence is \nthe language barrier. Locating grey literature that relates to UK policies is problematic \nat the levels already mentioned, but searching for non-UK grey literature is a near \nimpossible task unless the researcher is fluent in relevant languages, has a firm grasp \nof likely evidence locations or has the services of an information technologist with \nboth good general searching skills (internet as well as databases) and a good \nknowledge of the subject in hand. Non-UK grey literature, unlike the majority of non-\nEnglish language published journal literature that is indexed in mainstream databases, \nis less likely to be written in the English language and EBP research budgets seldom \nstretch to affording translation services. Reviews are unable to include much of this \nsort of (relevant) material, introducing an English language bias and reducing the \ncomprehensiveness of the synthesis. This bias is often extended by a lack of \nknowledge among English language reviewers of foreign language databases (some of \nwhich include grey literature, and some of which at least can be searched in English), \nand \u2013 equally (if not more) importantly \u2013 a lack of access to what are often \nsubscription-based services.  \n \nFor example, in the review of the effectiveness of recent labour market interventions \naimed at people with a disability or a chronic illness (see Box 2), grey literature \nsearching was conducted with relative ease for the two English language countries \n(UK and USA) but with less ease for Sweden (partial English coverage), while \nsearching the German grey literature was an unfeasible task. Even when relevant non-\nEnglish language grey literature documents were retrieved, mainly through contacts \nwith country experts, the research budget could not afford the services of a translator. \nThis was particularly the case when the documents in question were lengthy, with \nperhaps only a small part that was relevant to the research question, and which may \nwell have been excluded anyway at the quality stage of the review process. \n \n 7\nEvidence Design \nIn evidence based medicine, the systematic review method traditionally relies upon a \nrigid \u2018hierarchy of evidence\u2019 which is used to determine which pieces of research are \nincluded in the final synthesis, and which are excluded. Typically, only experimental \ndesigns are included (Cochrane Collaboration, 2001; NHS CRD 2001). The hierarchy \nis seen as particularly important in solving disputes between the findings of different \nresearch papers. For example, if the findings of paper A suggest that vocational \nrehabilitation is an effective way to help people with disabilities into work, while \npaper B suggests the opposite, the two research designs will be compared and the one \nthat is higher up the hierarchy will be preferred, given more weight in the final \nsynthesis, and be more apparent in the review\u2019s recommendations. However, the \nvalidity and utility of this traditional evidence hierarchy is increasingly being \nquestioned within evidence-based medicine on the grounds that it over-simplifies the \ncomplex nature of research, underplays the value of non-experimental research, and \nignores the contribution of qualitative research (Black, 1996; Sackett and Wennberg, \n1997; Popay et al, 1998; Bigby, 2001; Dixon-Woods and Fitzpatrick, 2001; Malterud, \n2001; Rychetnik, 2002). \n \nThese criticisms are particularly relevant to EBP research. Broader policy \ninterventions are, by virtue of their operation within open systems in which \nevaluations are more problematic and expensive to conduct, less likely to be the \nsubject of experimental research designs. They are much more likely to be covered by \nobservational research designs (considered as \u2018lower\u2019 down the traditional evidence \nhierarchy) or those, most notably qualitative research, that do not figure in the \nhierarchy at all. The evidence hierarchy, with its tight methodological exclusion \ncriteria, cannot therefore be transferred to EBP research without the danger that every \nreview will conclude that there is no (experimental) evidence on this topic (Davies, \n2000; Whitehead et al, 2000; Croucher et al, 2003; Egan et al, 2003; Petticrew, 2003; \nPetticrew and Roberts, 2003). Alternative approaches are thus being developed and \nused in which any idea of an evidence hierarchy is abandoned: while the focus on \nquality is maintained, the emphasis on which research design is better able to produce \nit is reduced (Croucher et al, 2003; Pawson et al, 2003; Petticrew and Roberts, 2003; \nThomas et al, 2003). The issue of study quality is not whether one research design is \n\u2018better\u2019 than another but rather how does the study in question match up to the \u2018ideal \n 8\ntype\u2019 quality criteria for that particular design (Petticrew and Roberts, 2003), or how \ndo studies with differing research designs match up to more generic standards such as \ntransparency, accuracy or propriety (see Pawson et al, 2003). These more inclusive \nand realistic approaches to establishing study quality acknowledge the diversity of the \npolicy-relevant evidence base and facilitate cross-study synthesis of evidence from \ndifferent types of research design and evaluation (Thomas et al, 2003). They \nintelligently acknowledge that large parts of the evidence jigsaw (Whitehead et al, \n2004) are, and can only ever be, covered by non-experimental or qualitative research \nevaluation, and thus enhance the utility of EBP research to policy makers by enabling \nthe synthesis of the \u2018best available\u2019 evidence. \n \nConclusion \nThis paper has highlighted a few of the methodological challenges and practical \nproblems that the conduct of a systematic review of a broad policy intervention(s) can \nproduce. In theory, the systematic review process of \u2018locating, appraising, and \nsynthesising evidence\u2019 (Petticrew, 2001) seems a simple and promising \u2013 if arduous \u2013 \ntask, but numerous difficulties emerge while trying to conduct it (Wallace et al, 2004). \nEBP research is more problematic in practice because the interventions, such as \nlabour market policies, are themselves hard to define, compare, isolate and evaluate; \nand because policy-relevant evidence, especially from non-English speaking \ncountries, is difficult to locate and based on a wide variety of study design. \n \nHowever, in pointing out the struggles that the review process can encounter, this \npaper is not saying that conducting EBP research is pointless or impossible. It simply \npoints out that the practical side of reviewing is a lot less easy and a lot more \ncomplicated than the theory suggests, perhaps echoing Walker\u2019s comment that \u201csocial \nscience cannot deliver to the policy maker all that is expected\u201d (Walker, 2001: 325). \nEBP research was perhaps initially presented to both policy makers and researchers as \na straightforward approach to locating, synthesising and highlighting research \nevidence. However, as this paper (and others such as Wallace et al, 2004) has tried to \npoint out, it is far more than the rigid application of a methodological technique. \n \nPolicy makers (and perhaps even some researchers) need to be reminded to limit their \nexpectations, especially of the evaluation of macro-level policies, in light of the \n 9\nfragile and situated nature of social research. However, we as social researchers \nnonetheless need to continue our commitment to the evolution of EBP research \nmethods, so that they are best able to deal with the limitations outlined and deliver as \nmuch as possible of the evidence base that policy makers desire. Already, much \nmethodological development has occurred within the EBP movement. For example, \ntheoretical work (Klein, 2000; Boaz et al, 2002; Packwood, 2002; Solesbury, 2002; \nYoung et al, 2002); more practice-based developments such as rapid reviews or \n\u2018evidence nuggets\u2019 (Gibbs et al, 2003; Lucas, 2003; Lucas and Liabo, 2003; \nBrocklehurst and Liabo, 2004); alternative assessments of evidence design and quality \n(Croucher et al, 2003; Pawson et al, 2003; Petticrew and Roberts, 2003; Thomas et al, \n2003); new means to appraise and synthesise qualitative research (McDermot and \nGraham, 2003), and new generic approaches to narrative synthesis (Pawson et al, \n2003; Thomas et al, 2003); and even technical developments on issues such as \ndatabase searching methods (Grayson and Gomersall, 2003). This work should be \ncontinued and expanded, so that EBP research emerges and thrives as a flexible, \nessential and prominent feature of the policy making process, regardless of who has \npower in Westminster. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nThanks to two anonymous referees and colleagues from the ESRC Evidence Network \nfor their helpful comments on earlier drafts. \n 10\nBox 1: Systematic review methodology \nThe systematic review is \u201ca review of a clearly formulated question that uses \nsystematic and explicit methods to identify, select and critically appraise relevant \nresearch, and to collect and analyse data from the studies that are included in the \nreview\u201d (Oakley and Fullerton, 1998). Put more simply, it is a method of locating, \nappraising, and synthesising evidence. \n \nThe review attempts systematically to locate all available research, both published \nand unpublished, and critically evaluates it on grounds of relevancy and a \npredetermined methodological criteria. Only research that is judged to be both \nrelevant to the review question, and which fulfils the methodological inclusion \ncriteria, is combined into the final review analysis. The systematic review \ncombines the results of these studies and thus provides a summary of the \u2018best \navailable evidence\u2019 on a given question (Chalmers, 1995; Greenhalgh, 1997; \nCochrane Collaboration, 2001; NHS CRD, 2001). \n \nGood quality systematic reviews follow a formal procedure which starts with the \nformulation of a precise question that \u201cincludes a definition of the participants, the \nintervention to be assessed and the outcomes to be measured\u201d (Davies and \nCrombie, 1998; Hamer and Collinson, 1999). This is followed by an extensive \nliterature search that is intended to find all research that relates to the review \nquestion. The search covers all relevant published and unpublished work (grey \nliterature) which is identified through a combination of electronic database \nsearches, searching the references of identified studies, hand searching relevant \njournals, and contacting experts in the field (Davies and Crombie, 1998; Hamer \nand Collinson, 1999; Cochrane Collaboration 2001; Glasziou et al, 2001; NHS \nCRD, 2001). \n 11\nBox 2: A systematic review of the effectiveness of different labour market \ninterventions, from Germany, Sweden, UK and USA, in helping disabled \nand chronically ill people gain employment \n \nThe high numbers of people unemployed and claiming benefits due to chronic \nillness or disability has become an increasingly salient political concern. This is \nespecially so in the UK where the number and costs of the main incapacity and \ndisability benefit claimants increased rapidly from 2.6 million claimants in 1987 \nat a cost of around \u00a37 billion, to 5.3 million claimants in 1996 at a cost of about \n\u00a321 billion (Brindle and McAskill, 1997). There are currently about 2.7 million \npeople claiming incapacity and disability benefits in the UK, around 40% of \nwhom will still be in receipt of these benefits six months later. Of this 40%, \nabout 80% will still be claiming after five years (Blair, 2002). Incapacity and \ndisability benefits are often claimed for a longer duration than unemployment \nbenefits. For example, in 2002, 76% of claimants had been in receipt of their \nbenefit for over two years compared to 9% for unemployment benefit claimants \n(DWP, 2002a). These benefits also currently account for the largest chunk of \nincome maintenance programmes with 8.4% of the working age population \nclaiming, compared to 2.6% for unemployment benefit and 2.3% for lone parent \nbenefit (DWP, 2002b). \n \nTackling the number of claimants and level of expenditure on disability and \ninvalidity benefits is not an easy task for policy makers. The UK government has \ntherefore had to take a relatively incremental approach, gradually increasing the \nnumber of active labour market measures, for example the training, employment \nand work incentive measures incorporated in the New Deal for Disabled People \npackage, and the employment rights incorporated in the Disability \nDiscrimination Act. This review was initiated to assess the effectiveness of these \ntypes of labour market measures both in the UK and elsewhere. \n \n\u2022 Question: How effective are different types of labour market \ninterventions on helping disabled and chronically ill people gain \nemployment? \n\u2022 Method: Systematic review of all available types of study \n\u2022 Population: Disabled\/chronically ill \n\u2022 Geographic coverage: Germany, Sweden, UK and USA. \n\u2022 Intervention: Labour market measures legislation (for example, anti-\ndiscrimination law, or workplace quotas), employment programmes (for \nexample, work experience, or work placements), work incentives (for \nexample, wage subsidies, or tax credits), vocational rehabilitation (for \nexample, job placement assistance, or training) \n\u2022 Outcomes: Effectiveness \u2013 in terms of employment rate and duration, \nincome, hours worked. \n \n(Bambra, 2003; Bambra et al, in press) \n 12\n  \nReferences \nAcheson, D., Barker, D., Chambers, J., Graham, H. and Whitehead, M.
