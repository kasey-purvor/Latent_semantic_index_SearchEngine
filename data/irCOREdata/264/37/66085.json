Many would \ninstinctively argue that the family home is a special type of property because it plays \nsuch a central role in our everyday lives. However, when attempts are made to \ntranslate this impulse towards safeguarding our family homes into clear law and \npolicy, it becomes apparent that the issues surrounding creditors and the concept of \nfamily home are complex and complicated by the nature of the interests at the heart of \nthe argument: the \u2018family\u2019, the \u2018home\u2019, and the commercial claims of creditors. This \narticle considers the practical and theoretical implications of family home analysis on \npolicies governing disputes between occupiers and \u2018non-home\u2019 interests, such as \nthose of third party creditors, and asks whether the concept of family home, as \ncurrently reflected in English law, provides the most suitable vehicle by which to \nachieve any \u2018special protection\u2019 deemed appropriate.  \nWe know that the idea of \u2018family home\u2019 is a significant aspect of the \nphenomenon of \u2018home\u2019, both in the popular consciousness, and in legal domains. For \ninstance, empirical studies focusing on the meaning and values of home have \nindicated that \u2018family home\u2019, as a special type of property, is conceptually significant. \nThe significance of family cuts across many of the values that emerge from \nqualitative studies on the meanings of home.1 Inferences extrapolated from occupiers\u2019 \nresponses have included the propositions that: \u2018\u2026it is the presence of children and the \nactivity of family life that makes a house into a home.\u2019;2 and that the family home is: \n\u2018\u2026a projection and basis of identity, not only of an individual but also of the \n 1\nfamily.\u20193 This may exacerbate the effects of losing one\u2019s home, since the research has \nindicated that function of home as a \u2018place of security and protection\u2019 becomes even \nmore significant to occupiers when the property is a family home shared with \nchildren.4 These associations raise interesting issues concerning the legal protection \nof the owner-occupied home - a question which is brought into sharp relief is when \ncreditors seek recourse to mortgage possession actions and other remedies to enforce \ntheir security interests against domestic property.   \nIf the law is concerned to recognize \u2018home\u2019 values in this context, a number of \nmodels are available. In some jurisdictions, for example, in certain Canadian \nprovinces and some states of the USA, homestead provisions provide an explicit and \nsystematic scheme of legal protection by exempting the home \u2013 to a greater or lesser \nextent \u2013 from the pool of assets which creditors may access to recoup their losses on \ndefault. In others, including New Zealand and Ireland, legislation regulates dealings \naffecting the home by requiring the consent of certain family members in order to \nvalidate security, and other transactions. In England and Wales, a more ad hoc \napproach to the protection of home has emerged, with provisions scattered across \nmatrimonial homes legislation, bankruptcy legislation, and provisions dealing with \nco-owned property or charging orders. While the more explicit approaches attest more \nobviously to prevailing policy choices, the ad hoc nature of policies protecting the \nfamily home in English law has tended to obscure their overall effects. However, \nalthough the nature and degree of any protection conferred on home occupiers against \ncreditors varies significantly, the instinct to safeguard the home, and to acknowledge \nthat a home is not identical to other types of property, is a common feature.      \nNevertheless, within each system, a further dichotomy exists, between policies \nthat seek to protect the family home, by focusing on the family unit, often typified by \n 2\nthe conjugal relationship, and those which value home per se, thus also recognising \nthe interests of individual occupiers in their homes. Although English law does not \nsystematically treat the family home as a \u2018protected territory\u2019, evidence can be found \nof policies focusing on both family home and home per se. Between these options, the \ntendency of both legislature and judiciary appears to favour a \u2018family unit\u2019 approach, \nrather than focusing on the interests of individual occupiers in the home per se. This is \nindicative of the implicit socio-cultural values informing legal decision-making in this \narea, yet while this proclivity towards a \u2018special protection\u2019 for the family home is \nreadily comprehensible, it raises a number of significant and controversial issues. \nFirst, adopting \u2018family home\u2019 as the relevant unit of analysis, rather than \u2018occupier of \nthe home\u2019, necessitates a delineation of the relationships that qualify as \u2018family\u2019 for \nthese purposes. What\u2019s more, however broadly these relationships might be defined, a \nsole occupier clearly cannot establish a family home in this context since \u2018family\u2019 \nessentially involves relationships between individuals. This approach also excludes \nsingle parents who are sole adult owner-occupiers, living in a property with children. \nDifficult questions may arise even when a property qualifies as a \u2018family home\u2019. By \nfocusing on the collective interests of the family unit it is presumed that family \nmembers have a unitary interest in the home. Individual occupiers may have a range \nof different interests in a single property: one or more of the adult occupiers will be \nthe owner(s); amongst joint owners, at least one, but possibly more, will be the \ndebtor; others may be non-debtor occupiers, including children, who generally have \nno legal interest in the property. When these interests are aggregated into one \u2018family \nunit\u2019, the individual needs and interests of less powerful family members may be \noverlooked. This is particularly apparent when the concept of family home is viewed \nthrough the lens of feminist theoretical analysis, as the marriage between the concept \n 3\nof family and the concept of home, twin pillars of the \u2018private sphere\u2019, may be \nregarded as compounding the gendered nature of the family home.  \nHowever, critical analysis of the concept of \u2018family home\u2019 is complicated by \nthe way in which both concepts \u2013 \u2018Home\u2019 and \u2018Family\u2019 - tend to be culturally \nidealized. The idea that the home ought to attract greater protection because it is a \nmeaningful site for family life is a potent one, since: \u2018[t]he home as a social concept is \nstrongly linked with a notion of family - the parental home, the marital home, the \nancestral home.\u2019;5 and this has been linked with positive attachments to a property, so \nthat: \u2018\u2026\u2018home\u2019 conjures up such images as personal warmth, comfort, stability and \nsecurity, it carries a meaning beyond the simple notion of a shelter.\u20196 There is a \ndanger, however, that the idealism surrounding \u2018family home\u2019 makes objective \nanalysis of the values that it represents, more difficult to achieve.7 From a practical \nperspective, it is argued that the focus on family in the English provisions has been \nunhelpful in avoiding forced sale at the hands of creditors. In addition, the application \nof a family-oriented framework reinforces an undesirable ethos of female dependency \nand invisibility within the home. Criticisms of family-centric analysis in this context \nare also supported by analysis of the relationship between family and home in other \ndisciplines.  \nThe article proceeds to consider whether it would be preferable for any special \nstatus conferred on the home in law to be detached from a \u2018family unit\u2019 analysis and \nrooted in an alternative, individual-oriented framework. Aspects of this individual \napproach, which recognizes the value of home per se, and the discrete interests of \nindividual family members, as well as the value of home to the family as a collective \nunit, have emerged in recent years when the protection of the domestic property has \nbeen discussed by Parliament, by the judiciary, and by the Law Commission. This \n 4\narticle considers the benefits of adopting an individual-oriented approach when \nframing the legal protection of the home, and argues that recognising the interests of \nindividuals \u2013 including individual family members \u2013 in their homes would be both \ntheoretically sound, and practically advantageous.  \n(2) The concept of home in English law \nSince English law has not adopted a systematic scheme for the protection of the \n(family) home against third parties, it has been suggested that the concept means \nrelatively little in English law.8 However, although disputes between creditors and \noccupiers are characterized by a general pro-creditor, pro-sale tendency, there are \ninstances in which the family home appears to be regarded as a \u2018protected territory\u2019.9 \nOn other occasions, the interests of individual family members become the focus, \nalthough the context of the family unit remains necessary. The interests of individual \noccupiers in the home per se, rather than the family home, have attracted less \nattention.  This section considers the ways in which the ad hoc provisions governing \nactions against domestic property in English law have shifted between these \nparadigms, and argues where the concept of family home has prevailed, it has tended \nto hinder, rather than help, the interests of both individual family members, and the \nfamily unit as a whole, when seeking to preserve the home against forced sale.  \n(a) Family Home \nThe Matrimonial Homes legislation10 was initially launched as an initiative to provide \nsystematic protection for the matrimonial or family home, over and above non-family \nproperty, as a response to the fact that English law: \u2018\u2026[did] not, as does the law in \nmany places (particularly in the USA and Canada), recognize a \u2018homestead\u2019 right of \nthe wife, nor does it give the wife of a bankrupt any preference or priority - perhaps it \nought to do so\u2026\u201911 In the words of Lord Denning, the law should protect the \u2018poor \n 5\nignorant wife\u2019.12 When the matrimonial homes legislation was enacted, this protection \ntook the form of conferring a \u2018right of occupation\u2019 on \u2018non-owning spouses\u2019.13 \nHowever, despite subsequent amendments, these provisions remain limited both in \nscope and, since the non-owning spouse\u2019s rights do not bind third parties unless they \nhave been registered as a charge,14 applicability.  \nNonetheless, where ad hoc attempts to confer some legal protection on the \nhome have emerged within general property law principles, the tension between \nindividual and family-oriented perspectives has frequently emerged. One illustration \ncan be found in the seminal decision in Williams and Glyn\u2019s Bank Ltd v Boland \n(hereafter Boland)15 and the policy debates that followed. Boland concerned the \ninterpretation of section 70(1)(g) of the Land Registration Act 1925, a property law \nprovision designed to protect the interests of individuals who occupied property.16 \nThe implications of section 70(1)(g) in relation to family homes were highlighted by \nthe decision in Boland,17 when the House of Lords refused to grant possession of the \nfamily home to a mortgagee following default, because the debtor\u2019s wife \u2013 who had \nnot been joined in the mortgage transaction - had an equitable interest and was in \nactual occupation. However, rather than providing a special protection, this merely \nraised the standard of protection for wives in family homes to the level afforded to all \nother occupiers.  \nThe decision in Boland confirmed that section 70(1)(g) applied equally to all \npersons in actual occupation of property, regardless of their relationship to the legal \nowner. Previously, although non-spouse co-occupiers had been entitled to claim \noverriding status under section 70(1)(g),18 spouses who shared occupation of the \nproperty had been excluded on the grounds that the wife\u2019s occupation was a \u2018mere \nshadow\u2019 of her husband\u2019s occupation.19 Although this no longer represents good law, \n 6\nthe pre-Boland position is a cautionary example of one of the dangers associated with \na concept of home that is defined in relation to the family unit in occupation: one \npartner, typically a female partner, may become \u2018invisible\u2019 to the law, and so left \nwithout protection against third party claims. In Boland, Lord Wilberforce adopted a \npragmatic, gender-neutral, and individualistic approach to the question, stating clearly \nthat: \u2018[o]ccupation, existing as a fact, may protect rights if the person in occupation \nhas rights.\u201920 Spouses were no longer barred from asserting their equitable interests in \nactual occupation as \u2018overriding interests\u2019 merely because of their status as spouses,21 \nand the focus of the provision was redirected towards the protection of individual \noccupiers. \nNevertheless, it is interesting to note the re-emergence of a desire to protect \nfamily home, rather than home per se in policy discourses following Boland. When \nthe Law Commission reviewed the implications of the decision, it proposed limiting \noverriding status to spouses in occupation, rather than all occupiers on the basis that \nthe law: \u2018\u2026has long recognized the need to protect wives in their enjoyment of their \nproperty and the matrimonial property, and has developed a growing regard for their \nposition.\u201922 Discussion in the House of Lords followed a similar slant, as Lord Simon \nargued that the \u2018integrity\u2019 of the family home is \u2018of great social importance\u2019,23 while \nLord McGregor welcomed steps to: \u2018\u2026secure and safeguard the values which society \nupholds in the institution of marriage and the family.\u201924 Although these proposals \nwere withdrawn due to lack of time in the parliamentary calendar, it is interesting to \nnote that when the initiative was re-launched, albeit unsuccessfully, in 1985,25 the \nexclusion of \u2018non-spouse\u2019 individuals who occupied the \u2018family\u2019 home, such as: \n\u2018\u2026grandma, the mother-in-law, and possibly the common law wife\u201926 was asserted as \nan argument against a more narrowly defined provision. \n 7\nThe idea of providing a special protection for the family home also emerged in \nthe context of another property law provision, section 30 of the Law of Property Act \n1925 (LPA). Section 30 of the LPA allowed a third party, such as a secured creditor, \nto apply for the sale of co-owned land. The judicial power to order sale was \ndiscretionary, however, since the land was held on a \u2018trust for sale\u2019, the courts \ngenerally tended to order sale when it was requested. Section 30 did not make any \nspecial provision for family homes, however, in a series of cases the court exercised \nits discretion to refuse sale on the grounds that the property was occupied as a family \nhome. In Stevens v Hutchinson,27 Upjohn J stated that despite his opinion that the \ndebtor was a \u2018ne\u2019er-do-well and a waster\u2019,28 unlikely to make good on his debts, a \nforced sale of the property would be \u2018unjust\u2019 since it would result in turning an \ninnocent wife out of her home. Subsequent cases suggested that the court\u2019s tendency \nto favour sale could be tempered in cases involving matrimonial homes by the fact \nthat: \u2018\u2026the house should be used as a home for the two of them.\u201929 When the \ncollateral purpose doctrine was adopted by the Court of Appeal in Re Evers\u2019 Trust,30 \nthe court emphasized its: \u2018\u2026great regard [for] the fact that the house is bought as a \nhome in which the family is to be brought up.\u201931  \nThese decisions are suggestive of the court\u2019s tendency to treat the family home \nas a special type of property, with a higher degree of immunity against forced sale by \ncreditors than other properties. Nevertheless, this apparent attempt to confer special \nstatus on the family home was ultimately unsuccessful. The failure of this judicial \ninitiative can be attributed, in part at least, to the strong pro-creditor and pro-sale \nstance that characterizes decisions in this context. In addition, however, it is arguable \nthat one of the weaknesses of the doctrine was its focus on the \u2018family home\u2019, rather \nthan the individual interests of the family members who occupied the property as a \n 8\nhome. The basis of the collateral purpose doctrine was the retention of the property \nfor the purpose for which it had been purchased. When that perceived purpose was \noccupation by the family unit, the court reasoned, this purpose would only continue to \nsubsist for as long as the family unit remained intact. When one family member left \nthe home, the court held that the family unit and, consequently, the collateral purpose \nof occupation as a family home, no longer existed.32 The interests of individual family \nmembers, and their desire to continue living in the property as a home, were \ndisregarded.  \nThis reasoning was also extended to include cases where the family unit \nremained intact, but one member of the family incurred a charge against the property, \nas the court held that this, also, revoked the original purpose of occupation as a family \nhome.33 While it is clearly the case, and arguably appropriate, that \u2018family-type\u2019 \nconsiderations are less persuasive in the context of disputes involving third party \ncreditors, the use of collateral purpose analysis in the context of creditor applications \n(albeit without accepting that the purpose survived the transaction) perpetuated the \nidea that the use of the property as a home was only relevant so long as no individual \nfamily member disrupted the continuity of the shared occupation, and no third party \ntransactions took place affecting the property. Ultimately, the irony of the \u2018family \nunit\u2019 approach in the collateral purpose doctrine was that the family home was only \nprotected if there was no dispute to be resolved.  \nFurthermore, even a successful outcome at this stage could leave the occupiers \nof the (family) home facing the ultimate prospect of bankruptcy proceedings.34 When \nan order for sale was requested by a trustee in bankruptcy, the court typically \nreasoned from the premise that: \u2018[b]ankrutpcy has, in relation to the matrimonial \nhome, its own claim to protection.\u2019;35 since the trustee in bankruptcy\u2019s duty to realize \n 9\nassets for the benefit of the bankrupt\u2019s creditors outweighed any possible inclination \nto safeguard the family home. It is interesting, however, to note the elevation of the \nfamily home in the enactment of counterbalancing legislative provisions: \u2018\u2026to \nalleviate the personal hardships of those who are dependent on the debtor but not \nresponsible for his insolvency.\u201936 The legislature\u2019s concern was with other members \nof the family unit, since: \u2018\u2026eviction from the family home\u2026may be a disaster not \nonly to the debtor himself\u2026but also to those who are living there as his \ndependents.\u201937  \nThe focus on dependency rather than the needs or interests of individual \noccupiers is a significant aspect of the \u2018family unit\u2019 approach. In the bankruptcy \ncontext, this reasoning distinguishes the protection of a debtor (the wrongdoer) from \nthe protection of the debtor\u2019s dependents (who may be regarded as innocent victims \nof the bankrupt\u2019s default),38 making it attractive to those who support the idea that \nhome attracts special protection, but are concerned about the merits of elevating a \ndebtor\u2019s interests over those of the creditor. When the dependent in question is a \nchild, this framework presents little difficulty, but where partners \u2013 usually wives \u2013 \nare concerned, the dependency analysis is problematic. Furthermore, it is clear that a \npresumption of adult female dependency was at the root of the protection. The debates \nthat preceded the enactment of the Insolvency Act 1986 revealed an intrinsic \nassumption that the male partner would be the bankrupt, and that the female partner \nand any children would be dependent on the male partner.39 The continual use of the \nfeminine person was accompanied by an assumption that, in the event of repossession, \nshe would be more severely affected: \u2018\u2026she risks not only losing the income from \nher breadwinner and facing the humiliation that bankruptcy inevitably brings, but she \nwill be penalized in practice more heavily than almost anyone else by losing the \n 10\nmatrimonial home.\u201940 The personal hardships attendant to bankruptcy: anxiety, \nfinancial straits and social consequences; were regarded as acting more on the female \ndependent than the male bankrupt, thus implying the proposition, heavily criticized by \nfeminist theorists,41 that the home is the woman\u2019s domain, yet she remains dependent \non a male breadwinner to provide. \nHowever, even within this family home provision, elements of a more \nindividualistic model are discernible. Section 336 of the Insolvency Act 1986 \nprovided that when dealing with a dwelling house comprised in the bankrupt\u2019s estate \nin which a spouse has registered rights under the matrimonial homes provisions, or \nwhere the bankrupt and his spouse or former spouse held the property as trustees for \nsale,42 while section 335A made similar provision for property that was co-owned \nunder a trust of land.43 In each case, when exercising its discretion to sell the \nbankrupt\u2019s family home, the court was directed, when exercising its discretion to \norder sale, to make such order as it thinks just and reasonable having regard to a range \nof factors including the needs and financial resources of the spouse or former spouse, \nand the needs of any children. This provision does enable the court to recognize \nindividual interests, although the property must first be identified as a \u2018family home\u2019 \u2013 \nthat is: \u2018\u2026a dwelling house which is or has been the home of the bankrupt or the \nbankrupt\u2019s spouse or former spouse\u2026\u201944 The reference to the needs of children as \nindividual stake holders in the home is preferable to subsuming, at the risk of \nobscuring, their interests within the family unit, but the benefit of the bankruptcy \nprovision is limited in a number of respects.  \nFirstly, case law on the exercise of the court\u2019s discretion under sections 336 \nand 335A of the Insolvency Act 1986, indicates that overarching pro-creditor position \nof the English courts has been persistently decisive: the circumstances must be \n 11\nexceptional before a court will refuse to order sale,45 and only the most extreme \nsituations \u2013 not including the mere presence of children46 - have been regarded as \nexceptional, and so justified delaying the sale of the family home.47 Although the \ndegree of protection conferred on the \u2018family home\u2019 by sections 336 and 335A is \nlimited, it is also significant to acknowledge that the scope of any purported \nprotection is curtailed by the threshold requirement of a \u2018family home\u2019, defined by \nreference to the bankrupt and the bankrupt\u2019s spouse. Although it might be argued that \nthe need to establish a \u2018family home\u2019 before the court\u2019s discretion arises provides a \nconvenient means of determining which individuals should be included within any \nprotection, one consequence is that the court has no discretion to take account of the \nneeds of children living in non-marital families, however exceptional the \ncircumstances may be. Although the court can consider the needs of particular \nindividuals, the discretion only arises in a family home context.     \nA further illustration of the difficulties underpinning the application of the \nconcept of family home can be found in the charging orders context. The Charging \nOrders Act 1979 provided a legal route through which an unsecured creditor could \nsecure a debt on the debtor\u2019s property, ex post facto, thus acquiring the status of \nsecured creditor. Significantly, with the status of secured creditor comes locus standi \nto request an order for the sale of the property.48 The acquisition of a charging order, \nwhich is clearly a significant step towards forcing the sale of the property, lies within \nthe court\u2019s discretion. The notion that family homes should attract special protection is \nindicated in a line of authorities identifying matrimonial occupation as a relevant \nfactor in the exercise of this discretion. The tendency towards family home analysis in \nthis context highlights, once again, the implications of focusing on family status rather \nthan individual occupiers\u2019 interests. These issues were most clearly brought out in \n 12\nHarman v Glencross,49 where Ewbank J described Mrs Glencross - who was a joint \nowner of the property as well as an occupier and the debtors\u2019 spouse - as having a \nclaim on the basis of her status as a wife. As a wife, the court held she had a: \n\u2018\u2026common law\u2026right to be maintained and housed during the marriage\u2026\u2019; a right \nwhich: \u2018\u2026arises from the status of the marriage itself.\u201950 The Court of Appeal \nconcurred with this analysis, and accepted Mrs Glencross\u2019s status as a spouse, and the \nfact that the property concerned was a matrimonial home,51 as part of the \u2018personal \ncircumstances of the debtor\u2019.52 The court focused on Mrs Glencross\u2019s position as the \ndebtor\u2019s wife, and therefore his dependent, rather than the fact that she was a co-\nowner and an occupier of the property in her own right.53 Although the reasoning was \nclearly influenced by the court\u2019s desire to protect the matrimonial home, it seems odd, \nparticularly in the context of a property law provision, that her interest was \nrepresented in terms of gender and marriage, rather than her own property ownership \nor independent occupation. The philosophy of dependency underpinning this \napproach was further highlighted in Balcombe LJ\u2019s suggestion that sale of the \nproperty should generally be postponed until: \u2018\u2026her death, remarriage, voluntary \nremoval from the premises or becoming dependent on another man\u2026\u201954  \n(b) Family Home: Themes and Issues  \nAcross the gamut of these creditor\/occupier contests, a number of common \nthemes emerge. Although disputes are generally determined according to general \nproperty law provisions, the policies which have emerged in their application reveal \nthe \u2018added value\u2019 implicitly attached to family homes. However, the discussion above \nhas also revealed a number of practical weaknesses in this analysis, along with some \nbroader difficulties associated with the rationale of the family home framework. \nFirstly, a focus on family home requires a definition of \u2018family\u2019. The specific policies \n 13\ndiscussed above generally correlate \u2018family home\u2019 with \u2018matrimonial home\u2019 \u2013 a \nproperty occupied by spouses. The matrimonial homes provisions, the pre- and post-\nBoland discourses, and section 335A of the Insolvency Act 1986 all defined a \u2018family \nhome\u2019 as a property occupied by spouses. This bias towards matrimonial rather than a \nmore broadly defined family home, or, indeed, home per se, was also evident in the \ncase law pertaining to charging orders, which based the protection of the debtor\u2019s wife \non her status as a spouse, rather than her occupation of the property as a home, or, \nindeed, her ownership interest.55 A cynical commentator might suggest that the \nexclusion of non-marital families from these policies has not been highly significant, \nowing to the general ineffectiveness of these \u2018protections\u2019 against third parties. \nNevertheless, from a conceptual as well as a practical perspective, the narrow view of \nfamily adopted for these purposes raises a number of crucial issues. \nOne such issue concerns the prevalence of dependency arguments in the \nbankruptcy and the charging orders provisions. This paternalistic view of a dependent \nwoman, supported by a breadwinning man, is rooted in the legal disabilities \nhistorically imposed on married women, who could not hold property in their own \nright and were rendered dependent on the common law duty of a husband to maintain \nhis wife. Although protectionist approaches can sometimes be justified as \u2018redressing \nthe balance\u2019 of social and economic inequality,56 Bottomley has argued that: \n\u2018\u2026whilst we must recognize the structural inequalities that women suffer from, any \nlegal strategies developed as an attempt to mitigate this must not reproduce models of \ndependency.\u201957 In family property terms, this can been characterized as the choice \nbetween recognizing the economic vulnerability of women, and so regarding the \nhusband\u2019s property in \u2018more familial terms\u2019, and treating women and men within \nfamily units as separate individuals, with independent interests and claims to the \n 14\nproperty.58 The application of family unit analyses in domestic property disputes have \ntended to cast the \u2018poor innocent wife\u2019 as a dependent, and while this approach could \nbe potentially useful when considering the needs of children, in the case of adult \noccupiers it is undesirable.    \nA further criticism to be made of the focus on family unit rather than \nindividual occupiers of the home - whether within a family context or not \u2013 is the \ntendency of policies regulating protection of the owner-occupied home to render \ncertain individuals \u2013 often the debtor\u2019s wife and\/or children \u2013 \u2018invisible\u2019 in the eyes of \nthe law. The \u2018collateral purpose\u2019 doctrine in the context of orders for sale of the \nfamily home illustrated this effect. When developing and applying the collateral \npurpose doctrine, the court focused on the purpose of occupation as a family home. \nThis focus on the family unit, rather than on individual family members, meant that \nonce one partner (the husband) had left the home, the family unit was broken. \nConsequently, family members who remained in the home could not argue their \nindividual independent status as occupiers of the property.59 Even where the husband \nhad not left the home, but had incurred a debt secured against his interest in the \nproperty,60 this action was regarded as defeating the collateral purpose of occupation \nas a family home. \u2018Family unit\u2019 analysis also implicitly presumes that \u2018the family\u2019 has \na coherent, unitary interest in the family home, although this will clearly not always \nbe the case.61 A presumption that the family unit has a single collective interest in the \nhome runs the risk of rendering individuals within the family, particularly less \npowerful family members \u2013 including children - invisible, leaving their interests \noverlooked and unrepresented.  \n(c) Home per se \n 15\nAlthough the tendency to elevate family home over home per se has limited the extent \nto which English law has protected the individual occupier\u2019s home, a few \ndevelopments in recent years have suggested that this perspective is not altogether \nabsent, and may be suitable for future development. The individualistic \u2018home per se\u2019 \nperspective recognizes that the (family) home is a special type of property, which \nought to be protected over and above other types of property, because of the nature of \nthe attachment which occupiers have to their homes, revolves around the relationship \nbetween the occupier and the property, rather than the relationship between occupiers \ninter se. Research on the meanings of home emphasizes the attachments that develop \nbetween individuals and their homes. Family status analysis, on the other hand, \nfocuses on, and takes as its trigger, relationships between people, rather than a \nrelationship between the person and the property. The home per se model was \nrecently endorsed by the Law Commission for England and Wales in Sharing \nHomes.62 The Commission described its project as: \u2018\u2026centered on a belief in the \nimportance of the home as property. The home is unique. It is the place where life is \nlived, it is the focus of the family, and the centre-piece of their communal security.\u201963 \nAlthough the importance of family was recognized as a contextual aspect of home, the \ncore principle of the project was: \u2018\u2026a belief in the importance of the home as \nproperty.\u201964 \nThe idea that home is not identical to other types of property also underpinned \nthe Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996, which replaced the trust \nfor sale, previously imposed on all jointly owned property, with a trust of land. The \ntrust for sale presumed that the principal purpose of owning land was: \u2018\u2026as an \ninvestment rather than as a home, to be bought and sold as market conditions demand, \nwith the beneficiaries being interested in the proceeds of sale rather than the property \n 16\nfor its own sake.\u201965 The shift to a trust of land was intended to acknowledge that: \n\u2018\u2026most co-ownership of property is for the purpose of providing a home rather than \nfor an investment.\u201966 The 1996 Act recognised the likelihood that jointly owned \nproperty was bought for occupation as a home, and the guidelines accompanying the \ncourt\u2019s discretion to regulate the trust included \u2018the purposes for which the property \nwas acquired\u2019. Evidence to date concerning the exercise of this judicial discretion has \nnot, however, suggested that the interests of individual occupiers are likely to prevail \nover the \u2018non-home\u2019 interests of third party creditors requesting sale.67 Indeed, \ndespite references to the use of property as a home in the debates preceding the 1996 \nAct, the idea of conferring special status on property because it is occupied as a home \nhas not generally been translated into a significant protection in the context of orders \nfor sale.  \nOne possible exception, however, arises in cases involving child occupiers. \nThe discretion to order sale set out in section 14 of the Trusts of Land and \nAppointment of Trustees Act 1996 is accompanied by guidelines set out in section 15, \ndirecting the court to have regard to: \u201c\u2026the intentions of any person (or persons) who \ncreated the trust; the purposes for which the property subject to the trust is held, the \nwelfare of any minor who occupies or might reasonably be expected to occupy any \nland subject to the trust as his home, and the interests of any secured creditor of any \nbeneficiary.\u201d Nevertheless, in Bank of Ireland Home Mortgages Ltd v Bell,68 the \nCourt of Appeal reversed a decision of the lower court, which had included the fact \nthat the property was purchased as a family home, and occupied by the bankrupt\u2019s \nformer wife and child as relevant factors, along with the poor health of the bankrupt\u2019s \nformer spouse, to be taken into account when considering whether to order sale. The \nCourt of Appeal held that the intention that the property should be held on trust as a \n 17\nmatrimonial home was irrelevant since Mr Bell had left the home, so that it was no \nlonger a \u2018family home\u2019 when the bank sought possession. Although the interests of \nthe children were not argued separately, it appeared that, notwithstanding the specific \nreference to the welfare of children in section 335A, the \u2018family unit\u2019 framework had \nbeen carried across through the reference to \u2018the purposes for which the property \nsubject to the trust is held\u2019, and precluded consideration of the individual interests of \nMrs Be\nhome f\nll and the children after Mr Bell had left the property. \nThe recent decision in Edwards v Lloyd\u2019s TSB Bank plc,69 has suggested, \nhowever, that \u2018the interests of minor occupiers\u2019 may carry more weight than erstwhile \nappeared to be the case, in arguments against sale. In Edwards, the court postponed \nthe sale of the disputed property after balancing the interests of the debtor\u2019s children \nin staying in their home against the creditor\u2019s request for sale of the property. The \ndecision in Edwards also suggested that, under the trusts of land legislation, in cases \ninvolving children, the original intentions of the parties may carry some weight. \nFurthermore, although one of the original parties \u2013 Mr Edwards \u2013 had left the family \nhome, Park J held that the object of the trust was: \u201c\u2026no doubt to provide a \nmatrimonial home for the husband, Mrs Edwards and their children.\u201d;70 and that this \npurpose continued to operate, notwithstanding the existence of the charge or Mr \nEdward\u2019s departure from the home. The presence of children kept the original \npurpose alive, since the court held that: \u201c[i]n part that purpose has gone, because the \nmarriage is over, but in part the purpose still survives because the house is still the \nor Mrs Edwards and the two children of the former marriage.\u201d71  \nAlthough this case suggests that the child occupier\u2019s interest in the property as \na home is generating more support within the exercise of judicial discretion, it is a \nmatter of some concern that although not directly linked to \u2018family status\u2019 or a family \n 18\ncontext, since the trusts of land legislation govern actions by creditors against co-\nowned land but not solely owned property, neither the guidelines in section 15, nor \nthe decision in Edwards are relevant where single adult households are concerned. \nAlthough Mrs Edwards had become a single parent by the time the dispute arose, her \nco-ownership with her ex-husband triggered the trust of land. On the other hand, \nwhere property is owned by a single individual, including a single parent, third party \nactions against the property are governed by a separate set of principles.  When \ndealing with solely owned property, a mortgagee has two principal options: to \nconduct an out-of-court sale, where the procedural criteria are satisfied,72 or, where \nthis cannot be achieved, to seek a judicial order for the sale of the property.73 When \nthe requirements for an out of court sale are satisfied \u2013 briefly, that the mortgage was \nmade by deed, that the legal date of redemption has passed, and that one of three \nbreaching events has taken place to render the power of sale actionable \u2013 the \noccupiers have no opportunity to defend the sale, and, as discussed below, must \nattempt to postpone the possession proceedings instead. \nWhen a judicial sale is requested, the court has an unfettered discretion to \norder sale, notwithstanding the objections of any person, and it has been suggested \nthat: \u2018[i]n exercising its discretion the court is not limited to considering financial \nmatters, but can also take into account social considerations.\u201974 In Polonksi v Lloyd\u2019s \nBank Mortgages Ltd,75 for example, the court ordered sale notwithstanding the \nmortgagee\u2019s objections that the sale of the property would not suffice to discharge the \ndebt, because the mortgagor had social reasons for wanting to move to a different \narea.  The mortgagor in this case was a single mother with two small children in a \nsolely owned property, and her reasons for wishing to move included her concern that \nthe area she was living in was rough and undesirable, and the belief that a different \n 19\narea would provide better schooling opportunities for her children and better job \nprospects for herself. While this authority suggested that the court might, in \ncircumstances of this nature, take account of the needs of the mortgagor and her \nchildren, the decision in Polosnki is significantly different from that in Edwards, since \nMrs Polonki was arguing in favour of sale,76 while Mrs Edwards wanted to avoid the \nsale of the home. For a child in a solely owned property, the fact that the property is \ntheir ho\nod that the debtor will make repay any sums due within a \nreasonable time.  \n (3) The \u2018marriage\u2019 of family and home\nme has not yet emerged as an argument against sale.  \nNevertheless, whether the creditor has an automatic right to sell the property \nor the court orders sale, the occupier may still defend the possession proceedings \nunder section 36 of the Administration of Justice Act 1970. Section 36 conferred \ndiscretion on the court to delay repossession for a limited period of time, where the \ndisputed property is a dwelling-house and: \u2018\u2026it appears to the court that in the event \nof its exercising the power the mortgagor is likely to be able within a reasonable \nperiod to pay any sums due under the mortgage\u2026\u2019.77 This provides a rare example of \na legal context where (what are in substance) home considerations are taken into \naccount. It is important, however, to bear in mind, that the conditions for the exercise \nof this discretion are strict. The court will not refuse immediate possession unless the \ndebtor can show that they have the financial capability to make good on arrears within \na \u2018reasonable time\u2019 whilst continuing to meet installments as they fall due.78 \nConsequently, although section 36 appears to acknowledge the value of home per se, \nthe court\u2019s discretion is not a general discretion, under which \u2018home-oriented\u2019, or \nsocial factors might be taken into account, but is limited to an assessment of the \neconomic likeliho\n \n 20\nThe previous section considered the ways in which English law has responded to \narguments in support of the family home, or even home per se, albeit within an ad hoc \nframework. It is suggested that although the tension between these approaches has \nemerged at various junctures, English law has, traditionally, implicitly preferred the \nidea that family home should be protected, over an above home per se. Nevertheless, a \nnumber of practical and theoretical criticisms have been made of this approach, \nranging from the definition of the \u2018family unit\u2019, the exclusion of single adults, \ndifferential approaches towards children, to the assumptions the family approach \nmakes about relationships within the home. The following section builds on this \nanalysis by arguing that far from being an obvious or automatic association, the \nconcept of family home is the product particular outmoded cultural precepts. Finally, \nit will be argued that a more individualistic \u2018home per se\u2019 approach would provide a \nmore appropriate modern basis on which to construct any legal protections for \ndomestic property.         \nAlthough the etymology of words relating to family and to home tends to \nsuggest a long-standing and almost instinctive association between the concepts:79  \n[o]ver historical time\u2026\u2018family\u2019 and \u2018home\u2019 were overlapping concepts, but \nwere by no means identical. The close identification of home with family is a \nrelatively recent phenomenon that can be traced to the late eighteenth or early \nnineteenth century. The concept of the home as the family\u2019s haven and \ndomestic retreat emerged only about one hundred and fifty years ago, and was, \ninitially, limited to the urban middle classes.80  \nThis modern concept of family home, in the sense of home as a private space for the \nfamily was derived from bourgeois family values,81 and was strongly influenced by \ngender roles: \u2018[t]he home represented security and comfort, the woman within it was \n 21\nthe \u2018Perfect Lady\u2019, the idealized feminine wife\/mother, the homemaker, the pure and \nwomanly woman.\u201982 Home was regarded as an archetypal \u2018private space\u2019,83 within \nwhich a husband provided for his wife and family under a duty of support which was \nboth gender-specific and patriarchal.84  \nAlthough it might be thought that the nineteenth century concept of family \nhome is no longer relevant to modern discourse, Wright\u2019s analysis of the \ncontemporary \u2018home model\u201985 across a range of cultural contexts testifies to the \ncontinuing influence of ideals and expectations relating to family, gender, class on \nattitudes towards home. Webster\u2019s work86 on the significance of home in relation to \ngender, race and identity in Britain highlighted an additional head of inequality, as the \nideal of \u2018family home\u2019 was, on the one hand, imposed on white women,87 yet \nunavailable to black women.88 Such disparities in the availability of the culturally \ncherished ideal of \u2018family home\u2019 continue to raise important questions about the value \nof retaining the concept as a central organizing theme of legal discourse. \nContemporary analysis of the concept of family home must of course address the \ncurrent debate surrounding the definition of \u2018family\u2019. This debate has raised major \nlegal and social policy issues, as arguments have been advanced in support of a more \ninclusive approach towards family status, based on a more functional analysis of the \nfamily unit. The current shift towards more inclusive approaches to family law in \nEngland and Wales is reflected in the proposals for Civil Registered Partnerships for \nSame-Sex couples,89 and the Law Society for England and Wales\u2019s proposals for \ngreater legal recognition of cohabitation.90 In relation to family property, both sets of \nproposals focus on claims between partners, particularly those arising at the \ntermination of relationships. In this relational context it is natural and appropriate that \n 22\nthe legal framework adopted is a family-oriented approach, however the remit of the \nfamily unit is defined.  \nHowever, the subject of third party claims to domestic property raises different \nissues which would, it is argued, be more appropriately resolved within an individual \nrather than family-unit perspective. The individualist model focuses on the \nrelationship between individual occupiers and their homes rather than the (gendered, \nor dependent, or narrowly defined) relationship between the occupier and the \nowner\/debtor. Property theory has traditionally attached weight to the interests of \nindividual occupiers:91 it has been argued that: \u2018\u2026to achieve proper self-development \n\u2013 to be a person \u2013 an individual needs some control over resources in the external \nenvironment.\u2019;92 and that: \u2018[m]ost people possess certain objects they feel are almost \npart of themselves. These objects are closely bound up with personhood because they \nare part of the way we constitute ourselves as continuing personal entities in the \nworld.\u201993 Analysis of judicial approaches towards various disputes was also applied to \nillustrate the argument that some types of property, for example the home, are \nimplicitly regarded as more worthy of protection than others, as \u2018property for \npersonhood\u2019, so that they: \u2018\u2026give rise to a stronger moral claim than other \nproperty.\u201994 Since the link between the person and the property is \u2018personal\u2019, this \ntheory is necessarily concerned with individual interests arising by virtue of the \nindividual\u2019s relationship with the property. This again adds weight to the argument \nthat, when dealing with security of tenure and attachment to home, the relevant \nrelationship is that between the individual and the property, rather than relationships \nbetween individuals, for example within a family setting. \nA more individualist approach would not only provide a more appropriate \nframework for any \u2018home\u2019 protection, but would also avoid the difficulties inherent to \n 23\ndefining \u2018family\u2019 for the purposes of family home. The application of a \u2018family unit\u2019 \nframework necessarily excludes single people, as well as \u2018non-family\u2019 households. \nAside from the obvious practical and social implications of such exclusions, the legal \nendorsement of this approach in the context of policies protecting the home \nundermines the importance of home for individual occupiers. Although family has \nemerged as a significant aspect of home meanings for occupiers,95 and may \u2018add \nvalue\u2019 to the concept of home, it is not an essential attribute. Many of the values of \nhome \u2013 for example, shelter, security, privacy, identity \u2013 can be equally valued by \nthose who fall outside the legal definition of \u2018family\u2019, either because their relationship \ndoes not meet particular criteria, or because they live alone. Furthermore, sole \noccupiers may be even more dependent on the meanings of home, such as identity, \nsecurity and continuity, than those living together within a family. The existence of \nclose relational ties within a family could enable them to bring many of their \u2018home \nvalues\u2019 \u2013 for example, family life, a sense of belonging, security, continuity and \nidentity \u2013 to a new property.96 On this reasoning, it is perhaps arguable that since, in \nthe absence of family, a single individual\u2019s personal identity may be more closely \nbound to the property itself, the occupation of a particular property could be even \nmore meaningful for single dwellers, and therefore ought to attract even greater \nweight.  \n (4) Alternative approaches: Homestead legislation \nIn some jurisdictions, \u2018homestead\u2019 provisions have been developed to confer \nsystematic legal protection on domestic property against third parties. These policies \nexplicitly recognize the home as a site of special significance, yet although the label \nconferred on such policies suggests that it is \u2018home\u2019 per se which attracts the relevant \nprotections, in reality, these policies have traditionally safeguarded only the \u2018family \n 24\nhome\u2019 against external third party claims. In New Zealand, the Joint Family Homes \nAct 1964 was intended to protect the family home against third parties. This \nprotection must be triggered by registration, and only spouses can register, but once a \nproperty is registered, a degree of immunity is provided against the claims of \ncreditors, up to a maximum sum.97 In Canada, third party claims are controlled by \nlegislation in Ontario,98 British Columbia,99 Alberta,100 Manitoba,101 New \nBrunswick,102 Prince Edward Island,103 Quebec104 and Newfoundland,105 which \ngenerally enables non-transacting spouses to prevent unilateral dispositions of the \nfamily home without their consent. A \u2018homestead-type\u2019 protection was also enacted in \nIreland by the Family Home Protection Act 1976, which was designed to protect the \nfamily home against dispositions by one spouse without the consent of the other.  \nThe legislative policy backgrounds of these provisions highlight once again \nthe implications of the association between family and home. In Ireland, for example, \nthe Family Home Protection Act was informed by the Irish Constitutional \nprovision106 that aspires to protect the home as the seat of the family. The basis for \nthis association between home and family is the presumption that: \u2018\u2026by her life \nwithin the home, woman gives to the State a support without which the common good \ncannot be achieved.\u2019107 The overtly gendered reasoning behind this protection is \nclearly associated with the idea of the home as \u2018a woman\u2019s place\u2019. In New Zealand, \nalso, the Joint Family Homes system was intended to: \u2018\u2026to ensure a degree of \nsecurity for the family home, particularly against the claims of creditors.\u2019108 However, \nalthough these protections were \u2018home-oriented\u2019 \u2013 that is, they focused on the \nrelationship between the occupier and the home, rather than the relationship between \nthe occupiers \u2013 the \u2018home\u2019 protection was by and large restricted to spouses, thus \nexcluding both non-qualifying family members and single people. This approach was \n 25\npartially challenged in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, where the Matrimonial \nProperty Act 1989 gave homestead rights to spouses only. In Walsh v Bona109 the \nplaintiff argued that the legislation breached the equality obligation imposed by the \nCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Although the enumerated grounds of \ndiscrimination in section 15 do not include marital status or sexual orientation, the \nCanadian Supreme Court has included these as \u2018analogous\u2019 grounds.110 The Nova \nScotia Court of Appeal held that this provision was in breach of the equality \nobligation, and therefore unconstitutional, since it excluded and thus discriminated \nagainst cohabitants. The legislature responded by enacting the Law Reform Act 2000, \nwhich extended the provisions of the Matrimonial Property Act to include \ncohabitants, either heterosexual or homosexual.111  \nThe solution in Nova Scotia was to widen access to existing family home \nprotections (to a certain extent). The inclusion of conjugal cohabitants does not, \nhowever, resolve the issue for other individuals who live in \u2018non-family households\u2019 \nor who live alone. However, in the United States of America, where 46 out of 50 \nstates offer some form of Homestead exemption to protect equity in the home from \nthe general reach of creditors,112 an interesting alternative model has emerged. The \nTexas Homestead exemption113 has provided one of the most generous homestead \nprotections in the US since its inception in 1839 by limiting home-equity borrowing \nto payment of the purchase price, improvements or taxes due on the property. The \ninterpretative commentary accompanying the Texas Constitution stated that the \nprincipal object of the scheme was the \u2018protection of the family\u2019. One commentator \nhas highlighted the traditional family-centric approach of the US homestead schemes \nby suggesting that: \u2018[i]n popular as well as legal parlance, homestead means not only \n 26\nfamily home but property that is accorded particular protection because it is the \nfamily home.\u2019114  \nNevertheless, judicial dicta concerning the application of the Texas homestead \nexemption suggested that although the scope of the provisions was originally limited \nto the context of marital families, even in the early years the concept of homestead \nwas not inextricably bound up with the concept of family. This was most clearly \nestablished in Wood v Wheeler, where Chief Justice Hemphill stated that: \n[t]he object of such exemption is to confer on the beneficiary a home as an \nasylum, a refuge which cannot be invaded nor its tranquility or serenity \ndisturbed, and in which may be nurtured and cherished those feelings of \nindividual independence which lie at the foundation and are essential to the \npermanency of our institutions.115  \nThe values underpinning this dictum correlate with many of the values that emerged \nfrom empirical studies into individual attachment to the home.116 Furthermore, the \ncourt clearly framed the protection in terms of the individual\u2019s attachment to the \nproperty, rather than the presence of family or relationships between the occupiers of \nthe property. In Franklin v Coffee,117 the purposes of the scheme were described as: \n\u2018\u2026not only to protect citizens and their families, from the miseries and dangers of \ndestitution, but also to cherish and support in the bosoms of individuals, those feelings \nof sublime independence which are so essential to the maintenance of free \ninstitutions.\u2019118 Considerable emphasis was placed on the security and independence \nof individuals, and the importance of protecting their home environments.  \nThis approach has also been reflected in developments \u2013 both judicial and \nconstitutional - in the scope of the homestead protection. Although it was initially \nconfined to family home, the courts gradually broadened the definition of family, \n 27\nwhile the underlying individualist-orientation of the Texas provisions ultimately gave \nrise to an amendment to the Texas Constitution in 1973, which extended the contexts \nin which the homestead exemption can apply to include single adults.119 As a result, \nthis homestead provision now comprehensively and systematically protects the homes \nof both individuals and family units. The family unit is identified according to \nrelationships of care and dependence rather than status.120 Furthermore, even where \nthe \u2018family\u2019 home is protected, the central organizing concept is the value of home per \nse: in order to establish \u2018membership\u2019 of the family, an individual does not need to \nshow economic support as evidence of a relationship of care and dependence, but use \nand occupation of the property as a home.121     \n (5) Family home or home per se: evaluating the options \nWhen evaluating the legal protection of occupiers in domestic property, it is important \nto bear in mind the overarching policy trend of English law towards creditor\/occupier \ndisputes. Even after the arguments surrounding the protection of family units versus \nindividual occupiers are unpacked, evaluated and rendered conceptually sound, the \napparently unshakable pro-creditor stance adopted by the English courts when \nbalancing these claims presents an enduring practical obstacle to real recognition of \nthe value of home in this context. The successful development of a more systematic \napproach to the protection of the home in law must be premised upon acceptance of \nthe proposition that home has some meaning in law outside its economic value as a \nsource of capital. In Texas, for example, the generosity of the homestead legislation \nevolved from its historical background as a frontier society, where the value of home \nas a home was recognised, alongside the broader economic consequences of loss of \nhome through repossession:  \n 28\n[t]he homestead exemption\u2026had a three-fold purpose: (1) to encourage \ncolonization, for in a frontier society, each pioneer family was of definite \nvalue to the community; (2) to provide the debtor with a home for his family \nand some means to support them and to recoup his economic losses so as to \nprevent the family from becoming a burdensome charge upon the public; (3) \nto retain in pioneers the feeling of freedom and sense of independence which \nwas deemed necessary to the continued existence of democratic institutions.122 \nHomestead provisions in the USA operate by restricting the use of the home as \nsecurity for the purposes that are not directly linked to the acquisition or improvement \nof property itself, and exempting the property from actions to recoup other, unsecured \ndebts. The argument that the use of the home as security for business loans should not \nnecessarily be encouraged or facilitated has been raised in the English context.123 \nArguments against the protection of the home in English law have included the \nassumption that creditors would not lend money if more effective remedies were \nextended to home occupiers. However, creditors are in the business of lending money, \nthe risk of default is inherent to the nature of that business,124 and creditors are in a \nmuch stronger position than occupiers when it comes to taking steps to protect their \ninterests, particularly when we \u2018count\u2019 children as individual occupiers.125 \nFurthermore, the broader social and economic costs of repossession126 add weight to \nthe argument that the interests of creditors should not be presumed to outweigh the \nhome interests of occupiers, but that their respective interests should be evaluated \nwithin a more systematic framework.  \nThe development of a systematic approach would necessitate a more explicit \npolicy in support of either: the family unit in a family home; individuals in a family \nhome; or individual home occupiers. From an instrumentalist perspective, the concept \n 29\nof family home is attractive, since the idea[l] of \u2018family home\u2019 is a powerfully \nemotive idiom, with considerable cultural kudos, and, as such, may be regarded as \ncarrying significant weight in policy debates. \u2018Family\u2019 is clearly associated with \n\u2018home\u2019 in the popular consciousness, and this is reflected in the tendencies towards \nfamily home discussed in earlier sections. Furthermore, although the analysis in \nsection 2 indicated that the \u2018family\u2019 dimension has been problematic in the legal \ncontext of repossession cases, family policy advocates could regard an ostensible \n\u2018rejection\u2019 of the family interest in the home as a high-risk and undesirable strategy, \nleaving them reluctant to cede any ground here, particularly at a time when the \nrhetoric of equality is gaining ground in other family policy debates.127 From a \nprincipled perspective, it is also important to bear in mind that empirical research has \nshown that family (in the non-legal sense of the term) is a significant factor in home \nattachments.128  \nAn alternative approach would be to focus on the interests of individual \noccupiers in their homes. The advantages of individually-oriented rather than family \nunit-focused approaches to issues of family policy have attracted some debate in \nrecent years. In Britain it has been argued that: \u2018[t]he fundamental dilemma for \ngovernment at the end of the twentieth century has become how far it can or should \ntreat adult family members as independent individuals.\u2019;129 while the movement \ntowards a more \u2018individual rights\u2019 approach for adults and children in family law and \npolicy in the US has been described as: \u2018\u2026the most important event that has occurred \nin family law that has affected family relationships in the last fifty years\u2019130 From a \nbroad family policy perspective, some concerns have been raised about the \nappropriateness of individual-oriented approaches in family contexts, where family \nmembers may not, in reality, be autonomous individuals.131 It has been suggested \n 30\nthat: \u2018[a]t first blush, the focus on individual rights may seem to diminish family \nrelationships, perhaps even pitting one family member against another\u2026\u2019132 Katz \nargues, however, that the individual-oriented approach to family life can more \nproperly be regarded as a positive recognition of \u2018individual rights\u2019 rather than selfish \n\u2018individualism\u2019.133 In the context of creditor\/occupier disputes, an individual rights \napproach to retaining the home would recognise the interests of individuals who have \nerstwhile been ignored in the context of such disputes. Since the effect would be to \nstrengthen the claim of the individual family member against an external third-party, \nrather than to pit individual family members against each other, the effect would be to \nenhance individual rights, rather than promoting \u2018individualism\u2019 within the family \nunit.  \nIn one sense, the \u2018family unit\u2019 approach may be regarded as a convenient \nmeans to distinguish between \u2018wrongdoers\u2019, ie the debtor him\/herself, and \u2018victims\u2019 \nof the debtor\u2019s default, and determining which non-debtor occupiers should be \nincluded within any protection. Although the Texas \u2018individual-approach\u2019 extends to \nsingle member households \u2013 in which case the sole occupier would also be the debtor \n- the idea of conferring protection on debtors against their own default is unlikely to \ngenerate support in this jurisdiction. Nevertheless, the individual-oriented approach \ncould be molded to serve a range of policy ends. For example, if, as a matter of \npolicy, it were considered desirable to prioritise the protection of a debtor\u2019s partner \nand\/or children in the home, this could be achieved by an \u2018individuals in the context \nof the family home\u2019 approach, rather than conferring equal protections on all \nindividual occupiers. As the Law Commission acknowledged in Sharing Homes, a \nsystematic framework within which all occupiers are treated the same overlooks the \nreality that some occupiers seem more deserving of protection than others: \u2018[t]here \n 31\ncan be little doubt that a court would instinctively have greater sympathy for the \nunmarried mother\u2026than for the child of elderly parents\u2026\u2019134 Although the traditional \n\u2018family unit\u2019 analysis has been exclusionary, and children have not counted for the \npurposes of a property-owning family, the idea of family context could be drafted to \ntake account of meanings of the home to a range of individual occupiers, including \npartners, single parents, and child occupiers.   \nA heterogeneous approach towards the legal protection conferred on \nindividual occupiers in their homes could also be justified on the basis that not all \noccupiers value their homes in the same way. Different individuals may have different \nlevels of attachment to their properties. For instance, Wikstrom\u2019s research indicated \nthat while: \u2018[i]n some cases these bonds [to the home] seemed to be so strong, that \nbreaking them by moving would lead to disaster [while] [f]or some young people, the \nflat was just a place where they slept and stored their belongings.\u2019135 A more impact-\nsensitive approach would focus on the effects of repossession and loss of home on the \noccupier(s), not only from a shelter perspective, but also in relation to psychological \nand emotional attachment.  Alternatively, the relative status of individual occupiers \ncould be approached from a welfare perspective by focusing on those who are \nregarded as being most in need of protection. This would enable a more \nindividualized approach to be pursued, with any protection based on individual needs \nand attachment, yet could provide an avenue by which the concerns of family \nadvocates, particularly in relation to children could be met. Children could be counted \nas \u2018individuals\u2019 for these purposes,136 as could single people, including, for example, \nan elderly widowed person living alone or a single custodial parent.137  \n 32\n (6) Conclusions \nThe home is a site of major importance in people\u2019s lives, whether they share their \nhomes with a partner, children, extended family, friends, or whether it is even with a \ndog, cat or goldfish. When legal processes are called upon to determine whether or \nnot an occupier will lose that home, any decision making should be carried out with \nan understanding of the complex interests at stake. The home is a special type of \nproperty, to which occupiers may develop strong personal attachments. Occupiers \nvalue their homes in a range of ways, not only as a source of shelter but as a particular \ntype of territory where interaction with family and friends takes place, inculcating \nvalues such as security, privacy, and identity. English law has no explicit scheme to \nconfer special protection on the home, yet the significance of home - or at least the \nfamily home - is reflected, to some extent, in the ad hoc policies discussed above. The \ndesire to protect the family home has clearly influenced various aspects of the \nproperty law provisions regulating owner-occupied property in the context of default \nand\/or bankruptcy. The close cultural association between \u2018family\u2019 and \u2018home\u2019 seems \nto have placed the \u2018family home\u2019 at the center of debates and policies concerned with \nthe values of home. The emphasis on family home has, however, had significant \nimplications on the nature and effectiveness of policies attempting to safeguard the \nhome, particularly against third parties. The identification of the family home as the \nunit for protection, rather than the interests of individual occupiers in \u2018hanging on to \ntheir homes\u2019, has, however, resulted in policies that are not only ineffective, but also \nvulnerable to criticisms of gender discrimination and paternalism. Other issues raised \nby the centrality of the family unit in policies regulating home include the difficulties \nassociated with defining a \u2018family unit\u2019, and the inherently exclusionary nature of any \nlegal definition of family. There is also a further danger that the interests of some \n 33\nfamily members, particularly women and children, may be overlooked or even \nignored, because of the focus on the family unit rather than individual members of the \nfamily. Finally, the \u2018marriage\u2019 between the concepts of family and home has historic \nconnotations linked with gender, class and race, which could be regarded as \nundermining the concept of home as a set of meanings that can be experienced, and \nvalued, by all occupiers.  \nThese criticisms of the \u2018family home\u2019 framework must, however, be balanced \nagainst empirical research which indicates that changes in family roles and structures \nhave not diminished the association between family and home. Conversely, it is \nsuggested that: \u2018[a]lthough the form of the family is undergoing change, the idea of \nfamily remains fundamental. By its association with family, the home\u2026hold[s] \ncultural centrality.\u2019138 The idea of adding value to the meaning of home because of \nthe presence of family is supported by empirical research indicating that for those who \nlive in a \u2018family\u2019 home, the \u2018family dimension\u2019, and particularly the presence of \nchildren, are significant elements of the home experience. Saegert and Winkel capture \nthis view in their description of the home as: \u2018\u2026the place where the cultural values of \nindividualism and achievement can be laid aside for a time. The family and personal \nrelationships become the focus rather than the individual.\u2019139 Nevertheless, the \nproposition that \u2018home equals family home\u2019 is incomplete. While family may be \nregarded as \u2018adding value\u2019 to the meanings of home, many of the values represented \nby homes: material shelter; security; control; orientation in space; permanence; \ncontinuity; privacy; self-identity; are not dependent on the presence of family. These \nmeanings can also be experienced and valued on an individual level and the absence \nof family does not relegate home to a meaningless, valueless entity. Furthermore, \ncross-cultural research on people\u2019s responses to their home environments has shown \n 34\nthat while: \u2018\u2026home can symbolize security and warmth or gender roles and \ndomesticity, or even tyranny through domination or abuse[\u2026]Whatever the concept \nof home, it is an individual meaning, often concerned with family, that is expressed in \nculturally recognized ways.\u2019140 Although family values are often associated with \nhome meanings, home remains meaningful for individuals as well. When \nconceptualizing home, it is therefore important not to lose sight of the meanings of \nhome for individuals, whether within a family unit or not.  \nThere are strong arguments in support of the development of a coherent legal \nconcept of home, which would enable the meanings and values of home to play a role \nin informing legal decision-making.141 In the context of disputes between creditors \nand occupiers, the fact that an occupier is attached to their home may not be regarded \nas sufficiently significant to justify exempting the home from repossession, or even \nsuccessfully swinging the balance away from the creditor\u2019s financial claim in all (or \nmany?) cases. Nevertheless, a clearer understanding of the values represented by the \nhome could justify subjecting certain decisions to stricter scrutiny. Although \u2018family\u2019 \nis a key aspect of these home values, it is not the exclusive source of meaning in the \nhome, yet a concept of home that is closely intertwined with family may undervalue \nthe range of individual meanings that home represents to occupiers. On the other \nhand, a more individualistic approach could still allow for \u2018added value\u2019 to be \nimputed in certain cases, possibly where the individual home occupiers include \nchildren. It would be preferable, however, if home values are taken into account in the \ncontext of legal decision making, for any weight attributed to home to be based on \nindividual attachments to the home. Focusing on the individual\u2019s relationship with the \nproperty rather than family status would also enable the legal concept of home to \n 35\nreflect more accurately the values associated with occupiers\u2019 attachments to their \nhomes.  \n 36\n 37\n                                                \n \n \n1 See for example, J.

In relation to family property, the Law Society focused on the \nrights of non-property owning partners on separation.   \n91 Occupation was protected independently of ownership, according to one commentator, on the basis \nthat: \u2018Men generally fix their affections more on what they are possess\u2019d of than on what they never \nenjoyed\u2026it would be greater cruelty to dispossess a man of anything than not to give it to him.\u2019; D. \nHume, A Treatise on Human Nature, (Reprinted from the original edition, 1928), Book III, Part II, \nSection I.  \n92 M. J. Radin, \u2018Property and Personhood\u2019 (1982)34 Stanford Law Review 957. \n93 Radin, above n 92 at 959.

Radin went on to argue that: \n\u2018[o]ne may gauge the strength or significance of someone\u2019s relationship with an object by the kind of \npain that would be occasioned by its loss.\u2019; at 959. In relation to the \u2018personhood\u2019 quality of homes, \nthis is borne out by empirical studies focusing on the impact of losing one\u2019s home, which have \nidentified extreme responses including alienation and grief amongst those who had lost their homes; \nsee also R.J Lawrence, \u2018Deciphering Home: An Integrative Historical Perspective\u2019 in Benjamin (ed), n \n3 above, 61-62; M.

These findings were supported by J. Ford et al, Home ownership in a Risk Society: A \nsocial analysis of mortgage arrears and possessions (2001) where loss of home following mortgage \nrepossession was linked to feelings of sadness, loss, insecurity, and sometimes damage to health. \n95 See above, notes 1-4 and associated text.  \n96 The proposition that families may have less need of home as a source of continuity if their home \nmeanings travel with them, is supported by evidence that, for children at least, the \u2018experiential home\u2019 \nmay travel with the child. Empirical evidence from a child who had lived in 8 different properties, \nindicated that despite the family\u2019s mobility, that child: \u2018\u2026only had one experiential home in my \nchildhood; my experiential home seems to have traveled with me and constantly transformed into new \nphysical shapes as we moved.\u2019; Pallasmaa, above n 3 at 135.  \n 44\n                                                                                                                                            \n97 This sum is currently NZ$82,000, Joint Family Homes (Specified Sum) Order 1996, SR 1996\/175. \n98 Family Law Act 1986, section 21. \n99 Land (Spouse Protection) Act 1996. \n100 Dower Act 2000. \n101 Homesteads Act 1992. \n102 Marital Property Act 1980. \n103 Family Law Act 1995. \n104 Quebec Civil Code. \n105 Family Law Act 1990. \n106 Bunreacht na hEireann, (The Irish Constitution) Article 41. \n107 Bunreacht na hEireann, Article 41.2.1. \n108 Davis, Introduction to Real Property (1979) at para 8.11. \n109 (2000)ACWS (3d) 287. \n110 See for example, Miron v Trudel [1995]2 SCR 418; M v H (1996)40 CRR (2d) 240; Watch v Watch \n(1999)67 CRR (2d) 311. \n111 It is noteworthy however that a \u2018domestic partnership declaration\u2019 must be executed before \ncohabitants come within the remit of this homestead scheme. \n112 The only states offering no exemption are Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island. \nThe amount of the exemption ranges from $500 in Iowa, to $200,000 in Minnesota, with five States \n(Florida, Kansas, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas) offering total exemption. \n113 See generally, J.L.

Although the decision in Boland (above n 9) caused some alarm on behalf of both creditors \nand conveyancers with regard to its deterrent effect on the grant of mortgages, the alleged difficulties \nwere described by Lord Scarman as \u2018exaggerated\u2019: \u2018\u2026bankers, and solicitors, exist to provide a service \nwhich the public needs.
