The proposed new expenditure \non the NHS will have a profound, but as yet unknown, effect on the demand for \nnursing staff, such that serious shortages in the short run are likely to constrain \nplanned capacity expansions.  \nThe authors conclude that recruitment is less problematic than retention. Our own \nanalysis indicates that attrition from the nursing profession is not as severe as from \nteaching.2 We used data from the British household panel survey (a representative \nsample of the United Kingdom's population) to trace all qualified nurses and teachers \nunder the age of 60. We found that 42.6% of nurses, compared with 53.9% of \nteachers, had left their professions between 1991 and 1996. Roughly equal proportions \nwere not working (14.5% v 15.1%). Of those who had left the nursing profession for \nother work, 50% were employed in other caring occupations, such as social or child \ncare; only 20% of leaving teachers remained employed in education.  \nComparing nurses who stayed and left, those who left were significantly older and \nless likely to be doing two jobs. They reported less shift working, earned on average \n7% less, and expressed more satisfaction with their jobs than those remaining in \nnursing. Some amount of wastage is to be expected from any profession, and nurses \nseem to compare favourably with teachers. But 33% of working nurses, compared \nwith 13% of teachers, reported that they were not satisfied with their jobs. What keeps \nthese nurses in nursing? Is it dedication to the profession, home ties, or lack of better \nopportunities?  \nDeepening shortages in future years may generate higher rewards that mitigate pay \ninequalities in nursing: teachers in the sample from the British household panel survey \naveraged 50% higher incomes than nurses. The concern is, however, that we will \ncontinue to rely on nurses' goodwill.  \n \nHeather M Gage, senior lecturer.   \nDepartment of Economics, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey GU2 7XH h.gage@surrey.ac.uk \n \nRosemary Pope, professor of nurse education.   \nEuropean Institute of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Surrey \n \nFiona Lake, research assistant.   \nGoldman Sachs, London EC4A 2BB \n \n \n \n \n1.
