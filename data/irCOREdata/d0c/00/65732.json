We describe the observations\nand measurements of central velocity dispersion \u03c3, emission line equivalent widths and\nabsorption line indices. The distinguishing characteristic of the survey is its coverage\nof a very wide baseline in velocity dispersion (90 per cent range \u03c3 = 40\u2212 230km s\u22121),\nwhile achieving high signal-to-noise ratio throughout (median 60per A\u02da at 5000 A\u02da).\nThe data quality will enable estimates of Balmer-line ages to better than 20 per\ncent precision even for the faintest galaxies in the sample. Significant emission at H\u03b1\nwas detected in \u223c30 per cent of the supercluster galaxies, including \u223c20 per cent\nof red-sequence members. Using line-ratio diagnostics, we find that the emission is\nLINER-like at high luminosity, but driven by star-formation in low-luminosity galax-\nies. To characterise the absorption lines, we use the classical Lick indices in the spectral\nrange 4000\u20135200A\u02da. We introduce a new method for applying resolution corrections\nto the line-strength indices. We define a subset of galaxies with very low emission\ncontamination, based on the H\u03b1 line, and fit the index-\u03c3 relations for this subset.\nThe relations show the continuation of the familiar trends for giant galaxies into\nthe low luminosity regime, with little change in slope for most indices. Comparing\nthe index\u2212\u03c3 slopes against predictions from single-burst stellar population models,\nwe infer the scaling relations of age, total metallicity, [Z\/H], and \u03b1-element abun-\ndance ratio, [\u03b1\/Fe]. To reproduce the observed index\u2212\u03c3 slopes, all three parameters\nmust increase significantly with increasing velocity dispersion. Specifically, we recover:\nAge\u221d \u03c30.52\u00b10.06\u00b10.10, Z\/H\u221d \u03c30.34\u00b10.04\u00b10.07, and \u03b1\/Fe\u221d \u03c30.23\u00b10.04\u00b10.06 (where the\nsecond error reflects systematic effects), derived over a decade baseline in velocity dis-\npersion, \u03c3 = 30 \u2212 300 kms\u22121. The equivalent slopes for the subset of galaxies with\n\u03c3 > 100 kms\u22121 are similar for age and Z\/H. For \u03b1\/Fe, a steeper slope is recovered\nfor the high-\u03c3 subset, \u03b1\/Fe\u221d \u03c30.36\u00b10.07. The recovered age\u2212\u03c3 relation is shown to be\nconsistent with the observed evolution in the giant-to-dwarf galaxy ratio in clusters at\nredshifts z = 0.4\u22120.8. In a companion paper, we determine the age, [Z\/H] and [\u03b1\/Fe]\nfor individual galaxies, and investigate in detail the distribution of galaxy properties\nat fixed velocity dispersion.\nKey words: galaxies: elliptical and lenticular, cD \u2014 galaxies: evolution \u2014 galaxies:\nclusters: general\n1 INTRODUCTION\nA key challenge in the study of galaxy formation is to explain\nthe emergence and build-up over cosmic history of the tight\nred sequence of non-star-forming galaxies, especially in the\nrichest environments. At the present epoch, red sequence\n\u22c6 E-mail: russell.smith@durham.ac.uk\ngalaxies account for some 50 per cent of the total stellar\nmass (e.g. Bell et al. 2004).\nThe evolution of the red galaxy luminosity function pro-\nvides a direct probe of the mass-assembly history of the red\nsequence. Recent surveys suggest growth in the red sequence\nmass by factors of 2\u20133 since redshift 0.7 \u2212 1.0, dominated\nby galaxies with relatively low luminosity (<\n\u223c\nL\u22c6), while the\nmost luminous red galaxies show little number evolution\nc\u00a9 2007 RAS\n2 Russell J. Smith et al.\nover the same interval (e.g. Bell et al. 2004; Faber et al.\n2005; Bundy et al. 2006; Wake et al. 2006; Brown et al.\n2007; Scarlata et al. 2007). The history of star formation is in\ngeneral distinct from the mass-assembly history of the galax-\nies, since dissipationless (\u2018dry\u2019) mergers of gas-poor systems\nmerely redistribute existing stars (e.g. van Dokkum 2005).\nFaint field-galaxy surveys reaching to high redshifts reveal\nthat star formation has shifted from high-mass galaxies in\nthe past to being preferentially active in low-mass systems\ntoday, a trend referred to as \u2018downsizing\u2019 (e.g. Cowie et al.\n1996; Juneau et al. 2005).\nIn galaxy clusters, the Butcher\u2013Oemler effect (Butcher\n& Oemler 1984) constituted some of the earliest evidence for\nthe recent rapid growth in the red sequence: a population\nof blue star-forming galaxies existed in some rich clusters at\nz \u223c 0.3 which is apparently absent at the present day, having\npresumably faded into the quiescent population in the inter-\nvening \u223c3Gyr. Rapid evolution in luminosity-selected stud-\nies is driven largely by a decline in low-mass star-forming\ngalaxies, which fade onto the faint end of the red sequence\n(e.g. Holden et al. 2006). After star-formation is \u2018quenched\u2019,\nespecially if the remaining gas was consumed in a rapid star-\nburst, the transformed galaxies may pass through a K+A\nphase (e.g. Dressler & Gunn 1983; Couch & Sharples 1987).\nThe characteristic mass scale of K+A galaxies is observed\nto be larger at high redshift (e.g. Tran et al. 2003) than in\nlocal clusters (e.g. Poggianti et al. 2004), a manifestation of\ndownsizing in the formation of the red sequence itself. Many\nrecent studies suggest that distant clusters are deficient in\nfaint red galaxies, relative to local analogues (e.g. Kodama et\nal. 2004; de Lucia et al. 2004, 2007; Muzzin et al. 2007; Stott\net al. 2007), as expected if many of today\u2019s faint red sequence\ngalaxies were indeed star-forming at look-back times above\na few Gyr (but see Andreon 2006 for contrary evidence). If\nthe present day red population is compared naively to the\ngalaxies already on the red sequence at high redshift, we in-\nevitably find only modest evolution the stellar populations\n(the so-called \u2018progenitor bias\u2019), since we are not comparing\nto the full progenitor set (e.g. Kaviraj et al. 2006). None\nthe less, recent studies of the red-sequence scaling relations,\nsuch as the Fundamental Plane, indicate a faster evolution\nin the stellar populations of lower luminosity galaxies, again\nconsistent with the downsizing scenario (e.g. J\u00f8rgensen et\nal. 2006).\nAn alternative means of probing the build-up of the\nquiescent population is to measure explicitly the stellar pop-\nulation ages of galaxies on the red-sequence at the present\nday. A mass dependence in the quenching times should show\nup in the current ages of galaxies, so long as the latter are\nnot in general contaminated by ongoing or renewed star-\nformation significantly after the primary quenching event.\n(This assumption might be better justified in cluster envi-\nronments than in the low-density field where rejuvenation\nthrough mergers could be more common.) Determining the\naverage stellar ages of galaxies from their integrated light\nis fraught with difficulties, from the classic age\u2013metallicity\ndegeneracy (e.g. Worthey 1994) to the presence of non-solar\nabundance ratios (e.g. Worthey, Faber & Gonza\u00b4lez 1992)\nand the confounding effects of composite stellar popula-\ntions (e.g. Serra & Trager 2007). Despite these challenges,\nmodern spectral synthesis models, notably those of Worthey\n(1994) and Thomas and collaborators (Thomas, Maraston\n& Bender 2003; Thomas, Maraston & Korn 2004), have en-\nabled great progress in separating the effects of age, metal-\nlicity and abundance ratios on the principal spectral lines.\n(While we will focus here on line-index methods, we note\nthat Heavens et al. (2004) have developed an alternative,\n\u2018full-spectrum\u2019, method to constrain star-formation histories\nfrom the present-day galaxy population.)\nMany studies have employed these and similar models\nto analyse modest samples of low-redshift galaxies, mostly\ncorresponding to giant elliptical and S0 galaxies. We high-\nlight here only a selection of notable work. Kuntschner\n(2000) concluded that Fornax cluster ellipticals form a\nmetallicity sequence at constant (old) age, while S0s in\nFornax show a wider age spread. Trager et al. (2000b)\nrecovered a wide spread in ages, with an age\u2013metallicity\nanti-correlation maintaining the tight broad-band colour\u2013\nmagnitude relation. They show a tendency for younger ages\nat lower \u03c3, at least for galaxies outside of rich clusters. More\nrecently Thomas et al. (2005) compiled data from a num-\nber of sources for \u223c200 galaxies, arguing for a fairly shallow\nage\u2013mass relation (although this conclusion was reached af-\nter excluding some young low-mass objects from their fits).\nComplementary to these high signal-to-noise (S\/N)\nstudies of small galaxy samples, a number of works have\nused spectroscopic surveys of thousands of galaxies to ex-\ntract the age-mass relations for red galaxies, although with\nlower typical S\/N per galaxy. Among these, Nelan et al.\n(2005), working from the red-sequence-selected NOAO Fun-\ndamental Plane Survey (NFPS), strongly confirmed the ear-\nlier hints at an age\u2013mass trend, with Age\u221d \u03c30.6\u00b10.1 (see\nalso Smith et al. 2006). Subsequently, similar trends were\nobtained by selecting red and\/or early-type galaxy sam-\nples from the SDSS: Bernardi et al. (2006) recovered Age\u221d\n\u03c30.8\u22121.2 (depending on which age estimator is used), while\nClemens et al. (2006) found Age\u221d \u03c30.8 (our estimate from\ntheir figure 10). Although these surveys suggest an emerging\nconsensus on the existence of the age\u2013mass relation, there\nare still some apparently contradictory results. For instance,\nSa\u00b4nchez-Bla\u00b4zquez et al. (2006b) report uniformly old ages in\ntheir sample of \u223c20 Coma ellipticals (including five galaxies\nwith \u03c3 = 30 \u2212 100 km s\u22121), although their Virgo and \u2018field\u2019\nsamples show a trend with Age\u221d \u03c30.5\u22121.0. It is possible\nthat different selection methods, in particular colour selec-\ntion versus detailed visual morphological inspection, are at\nthe root of these differences.\nGiven the strong intermediate-redshift evidence for\ndownsizing and the mass-dependent build-up of the red se-\nquence, there is a pressing need to determine present-day\ngalaxy ages over a wide mass baseline. Among the studies\ndescribed above, however, most are limited to galaxies near\nthe break in the luminosity function, M\u22c6. For example, the\nmedian velocity dispersion, \u03c3, is \u223c200 kms\u22121 for the SDSS-\nbased studies (Bernardi et al., Clemens et al.), and for the\nThomas et al. compilation (which includes only four galax-\nies with \u03c3 < 100 kms\u22121). The NFPS is somewhat better in\nthis regard, with median \u03c3 around 150 kms\u22121, but the S\/N\nachieved on individual galaxies is sufficient only to deter-\nmine an average age at low mass. To trace the build-up of\nthe red sequence since z \u223c 1, where the activity is mostly\nin faint galaxies, it is necessary to extend the sampling to\nstill lower \u03c3, while maintaining high spectral S\/N (required\nfor reliable age measurements), and samples of meaningful\nc\u00a9 2007 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u221220\nShapley Supercluster: Stellar population trends 3\nsize and reproducible selection criteria. A first step towards\nthis goal was made by Mobasher et al. (2001) in their sur-\nvey of Coma cluster members, extending to low luminosities.\nHowever, the resolution of this survey was not sufficient to\nmeasure velocity dispersion to act as a mass proxy, and the\nS\/N (per Angstrom) was too low to determine meaningful\nages for individual galaxies in the fainter part of the sam-\nple. Using the Mobasher et al. data, Poggianti et al. (2001)\nfound only a very weak dependence of age on luminosity, and\na very wide spread in age at all luminosities. Caldwell, Rose\n& Concannon (2003) made a higher-resolution and higher-\nS\/N study of 175 galaxies (many in Virgo), with 40 galaxies\nin the regime \u03c3 = 40 \u2212 100 km s\u22121, recovering a trend of\nAge\u221d \u03c30.8. More recently, Matkovic\u00b4 & Guzma\u00b4n (2005) have\nobserved \u223c90 galaxies in Coma, including 37 galaxies with\n\u03c3 < 100 kms\u22121 and S\/N > 20 per Angstrom. This sample\nappears to follow an age\u2013mass relation with a similar slope\nto the Nelan et al. result (Matkovic\u00b4, private communica-\ntion). Finally, two studies of true dwarf galaxies illustrate\nthe wide range in properties which perhaps co-exist in the\nlow-luminosity population: Geha, Guhathakurta & van der\nMarel (2003) observed 17 Virgo dwarf ellipticals (dEs) with\n\u03c3 = 23\u2212 45 kms\u22121, and obtained an average age of \u223c5Gyr.\nAt the other end of the surface-brightness scale, a sample of\nsix ultra-compact dwarfs in Virgo, also with \u03c3 \u223c 30 kms\u22121,\nyields ages of >\n\u223c\n10Gyr (Evstigneeva et al. 2007).\nThis paper presents the first results from deep observa-\ntions of galaxies in the Shapley Supercluster with the Anglo-\nAustralian Telescope (AAT). The objective is to investigate\nthe not only the mean scaling relationships but also the in-\ntrinsic scatter in the stellar population parameters, their\ncorrelation structure, and their dependence on luminosity,\nmorphology and environment. Particular emphasis will be\nplaced on the faint red-sequence galaxies, which are expected\nto have experienced the most recent truncation events. Such\nan analysis requires age and metallicity measurements for\nhundreds of individual galaxies, spanning a wide range in\nmass, and reaching the level of precision so far achieved only\nfor small samples of high-mass objects. The Shapley Super-\ncluster (Proust et al. 2006 and references therein), is an ideal\ntarget for such a campaign, since it provides an exceptional\ndensity of galaxies and clusters within a few square degrees\non the sky. The angular scale of the supercluster and the\ndensity of feasible targets are well matched to the two de-\ngree diameter field of the AAOmega fibre-fed spectrograph\n(Sharp et al. 2006). For a sample with these characteristics,\nAAOmega delivers a larger multiplex advantage than any\ninstrumentation available on larger telescopes.\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we\ndescribe the sample selection (2.1), the spectroscopic obser-\nvations and data reduction (2.2), and measurements of red-\nshift and velocity dispersion (2.3), emission line equivalent\nwidths (2.4), and absorption line indices (2.5). In Section 3\nwe present statistics of objects showing significant emission\nlines. We next define the sample of low-emission supercluster\nmembers for further analysis, and tabulate data for this sam-\nple (Section 4). Section 5 presents an initial analysis of the\nstellar population scaling relations, based on the index\u2212\u03c3\nrelations. A comparison of these results to previous work is\nmade in Section 6, and the the main conclusions reviewed\nin Section 7.\nIn a companion paper (Smith, Lucey & Hudson 2007,\nhereafter Paper II), we use our line-strength data to infer\nthe age, total metallicity and [\u03b1\/Fe] ratio for each galaxy,\nand investigate the age\u2013metallicity\u2013mass relations and their\nintrinsic scatter.\nThroughout this paper, we adopt cosmological param-\neters (\u2126M ,\u2126\u039b, h) = (0.3, 0.7, 0.7). For reference, at the red-\nshift of Shapley (z = 0.048), one arcminute corresponds to\n57 kpc, and the distance modulus is m\u2212M = 36.65.\n2 OBSERVATIONS AND PARAMETER\nMEASUREMENTS\n2.1 Sample selection\nThe primary galaxy sample was selected using BR imaging\ndata from the NOAO Fundamental Plane Survey (NFPS),\ndescribed by Smith et al. (2004). The images were obtained\nwith Mosaic-II at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Obser-\nvatory 4m telescope in March 2000. Targets were selected\nfrom the same photometric catalogues, generated using SEx-\ntractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996), as were used to defining\nthe NFPS spectroscopic sample. The systematic zero-point\nerrors in the catalogues are estimated at \u223c0.03mag. Star-\ngalaxy separation is via the usual stellarity index of SExtrac-\ntor, limited by image quality ranging from 0.9 to 1.5 arcsec\nFWHM.\nThe input catalogue for the spectroscopic phase was\ndefined purely by total magnitude with R < 18 (one mag-\nnitude deeper than NFPS), before correction for galactic\nextinction (median E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.053, AR = 0.14, from\nSchlegel, Finkbeiner & Davis 1998). No cuts were made on\nthe colour relative to the red sequence (unlike NFPS), nor\non morphological type. No redshift information was used in\nselecting the sample, so some contamination by background\nand foreground galaxies is expected. The input catalogue\nis inevitably incomplete with respect to low surface bright-\nnesses (SB), since very low-SB galaxies will not have been\ndetected by SExtractor. Moreover, very compact galaxies\nwill be misidentified as stars in the imaging data available\nfor selection (M32, placed at the distance of Shapley, would\nhave an effective radius of \u223c0.1 arcsec). Figure 1 shows the\ntarget catalogue in a B\u2212R versusMR colour\u2013magnitude di-\nagram. Pre-empting the following sections, the figure distin-\nguishes the galaxies to which fibres were ultimately assigned,\nand also those which prove to be within the supercluster and\nhave pure absorption-line spectra.\nThe NFPS imaging data were obtained in\n\u223c40\u00d740 arcmin2 tiles centred on the three rich clusters\nAbell 3556, Abell 3558 and Abell 3562 (for comparison, the\nvirial radius of a \u03c3cl = 1000 kms\n\u22121 cluster is \u223c 45 arcmin\nat the Shapley distance). As such, they cover only a small\npart of AAOmega\u2019s two degree diameter field of view.\nDue to fibre-placement limitations, the target galaxies do\nnot exhaust the available fibres. Supplementary objects\nwere added from the 2MASS Extended Source Catalogue\n(Jarrett et al. 2000), which is limited approximately by\nJ < 15, equivalent to R<\n\u223c\n15.6 for red galaxies. These\ngalaxies are more extended over the field, and could readily\nbe assigned unused fibres. However, to maintain a very\nsimple sample description, the 2MASS targets will not be\nanalysed in this paper.\nc\u00a9 2007 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u221220\n4 Russell J.

In the lower panel, we show the fraction of R < 18\ngalaxies observed, relative to the NFPS photometric catalogue\n(dashed line), and the fraction of NFPS catalogue galaxies which\nare used in the absorption-line analysis (solid line).\n2.2 AAOmega spectroscopy\nSpectroscopic observations were made with the AAOmega\nsystem (Sharp et al. 2006) on the 3.9m Anglo-Australian\nTelescope, on the nights of 2006 April 26 and 29. AAOmega\nconsists of the 2dF fibre positioner (Lewis et al. 2002), linked\nto an efficient and stable bench-mounted dual-beam spectro-\ngraph. The positioner can place 392 fibres, with 2 arcsec pro-\njected diameter, within a \u223c2 degree diameter field of view.\nWithin each configuration there is a minimum target sep-\naration of \u223c30 arcsec imposed by the physical size of the\nfibre buttons (for further details of the fibre positioning con-\nstraints, see Miszalski et al. 2006).\nTwo fibre configurations were employed, with substan-\ntially overlapping fields of view. The allocation of fibres to\nthe targets was performed in a two-stage process. First, ap-\nproximately 70 fibres known to exhibit significant fringing\neffects were withdrawn, and the remaining \u2018good\u2019 fibres al-\nlocated to the R < 18 sample galaxies. Some 30 \u2018good\u2019 fibres\nwere assigned to random positions to sample the background\nsky spectrum. In a second step, the locations of the these\nfibres were held fixed, while remaining fibres (both \u2018good\u2019\nand \u2018fringed\u2019) were allocated where possible to extra targets\nfrom the 2MASS sample.\nIn the blue arm of the spectrograph, the 580V grating\nwas used, delivering a nominal resolution of 3.5A\u02da FWHM\nfrom 3700\u20135800 A\u02da, sampled at 1.0 A\u02da per pixel. The blue data\nthus cover most of the standard Lick absorption lines, and\nalso the OII 3727A\u02da emission line when present. Simultaneous\nobservations were obtained in the red arm of the spectro-\ngraph, using the 1000R grating, in order to measure nebular\nemission at H\u03b1. The instantaneous wavelength coverage is\n\u223c1100 A\u02da and the nominal resolution is 1.9 A\u02da, sampled at\n0.6 A\u02da per pixel. The two fields were observed alternately, in\nvisits of 1.5\u20133.0 hours, to a total integration time of 8\u20139\nhours. In this way, each configuration was observed always\nwith the same field plate and fibre bundle, so that all the\nspectra for a given galaxy were obtained with the same fi-\nbre. (Exceptions are seven objects common to both fields, of\nwhich one is a star). Between the two nights, we introduced\na small shift (\u223c30 A\u02da) in central wavelength for the blue spec-\ntra, in order to fill gaps left by blocks of bad columns in the\ndetector. In the red arm, a larger shift (\u223c350 A\u02da) was used\nto expand the total wavelength coverage (to 5800\u20137300 A\u02da).\nA total of 565 targets were observed, with 416 from the pri-\nmary NFPS sample and 149 from the supplementary 2MASS\nlist. Overall, \u223c60% of the NFPS sample targets were ob-\nserved. Note that because the magnitude information was\nnot used in prioritising fibre assignment, the observed frac-\ntion is not a strong function of luminosity.\nThe data were reduced using a combination of the\nAAO drcontrol pipeline with custom-written procedures.\nThe two-dimensional frames were first cleaned of manually-\nidentified bad columns, while remaining bad pixels and cos-\nmic ray hits were identified using LA Cosmic (van Dokkum\n2001). The well-sampled PSF of AAOmega ensures that cos-\nmic rays are clearly distinguished from narrow sky lines and\nemission lines. The spectra were flat-fielded and extracted\n(using a Gaussian profile extraction) with drcontrol. The\ncombination of spectra from the many 30minute exposures\nis automated, but handled on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis. Ex-\namination of the data revealed sizable variations in signal-\nto-noise ratio (S\/N) between exposures, for some (but not\nall) objects. To lessen the impact of these variations, we first\ndetermine the maximum S\/N attained for the galaxy, then\ndiscard any individual exposures with S\/N less than a quar-\nter of this maximum value before combining to form the final\nspectrum. This criterion rejects only \u223c2.5% of the \u223c10000\nindividual spectra obtained, but \u223c10% of galaxies have at\nleast one rejected spectrum. Around half of the affected spec-\ntra are from fibres close to the edge of the field-of-view,\nwhile the other half are concentrated in an annulus around\n0.27 degrees from the field centre. The S\/N variations near\nthe edge of the field are more frequent at high airmass, and\nprobably result from varying atmospheric refraction over the\nc\u00a9 2007 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u221220\nShapley Supercluster: Stellar population trends 5\ncourse of a field visit, which can cause relative positional\noffsets of \u223c1 arcsec in the worst cases. For comparison the\nsample galaxies have effective radii typically 2\u20134 arcsec (F.\nLa Barbera, private communication). When combining the\nspectra we propagate the error spectra from drcontrol,\nincluding missing data flags, to produce a final error spec-\ntrum for each galaxy. Finally, an approximate relative flux\ncalibration was imposed using the observed spectrum of a\ncalibration star.\nEach of the combined spectra was examined by eye to\nidentify any objects unsuitable for the subsequent analysis.\nThese are: seven stars, three objects in which the target is\nclearly contaminated by a second galaxy with very differ-\nent redshift, or by a star, and 15 galaxies whose combined\nspectra are affected by sinusoidal continuum variations, at-\ntributed to \u2018fringing\u2019. These objects are rejected entirely\nfrom further discussion. For the remaining 540 \u2018uncorrupted\u2019\ngalaxies, the visual inspection confirms there is sufficient\nsignal to measure at least a reliable redshift, and that any\nremaining blemishes (usually from very low-level detector\ndefects and visible only in the faintest galaxies) affect only\nlocalised wavelength regions. Among these galaxies, 402 are\nfrom the primary (NFPS) sample and 138 from the 2MASS\nsupplementary sample.\nTotal integrations range from five hours to nine hours\nfor most galaxies. Around thirty galaxies have integrations\nfrom two to five hours, after the S\/N cut described above.\nFinally, six galaxies, observed in both field configurations,\nhave total integration times of 14\u201317 hours.\n2.3 Redshifts and velocity dispersions\nReliable velocity dispersion measurements depend on com-\nparing the galaxy spectra to templates which match them\nas closely as possible. Traditionally, a small number of K\ngiant stars have been observed through the same instrumen-\ntal set-up for use as templates. While the red giant branch\nindeed contributes substantially to the integrated V-band\nlight of red-sequence galaxies, there is a comparable contri-\nbution from main-sequence stars near the turn-off (e.g. Fig.\n13 of Maraston 2005). The contribution from hotter stars\nvaries systematically with wavelength, and also as a func-\ntion of the age and metallicity of the target galaxy itself. As\na result, a single template star cannot match well over an ex-\ntended wavelength region. Errors associated with this \u2018tem-\nplate mismatch\u2019 can cause systematic bias in the recovered\nvelocity dispersions. Methods have been developed which\nminimize template mismatch by fitting optimal combina-\ntions of template stars (e.g. pPXF of Cappellari & Emsellem\n2004). Here however, we adopt an alternative approach, us-\ning as templates a set of synthetic SSP spectra covering a\nrange in metallicity and age. The key requirement is that\nthe spectral resolution of the models exceed the instrumen-\ntal resolution. In this paper we employ the synthesis models\nby Vazdekis et al. (2007), based on the 2.4 A\u02da MILES spectral\nlibrary (Sa\u00b4nchez\u2013Bla\u00b4zquez et al. 2006c).\nRedshifts are required in order to select a common\nrest-frame wavelength interval for the dispersion measure-\nments. We determine absorption-line redshifts using the\ncross-correlation method (Tonry & Davis 1981), as imple-\nmented in iraf as fxcor. The whole observed spectrum is\nused at this stage. A high-order spline fit to the spectrum is\nused to identify strong emission lines, which are interpolated\nover to reduce their influence in the cross-correlation. For ra-\ndial velocity templates, we employ a reduced set of MILES\nSSP spectral models. Specifically, we used solar-metallicity\nSSP models with ages 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0 and 16.0 Gyr,\nadopting the redshift corresponding to the best-matching\nSSP, as judged from the fxcor R-value. The young SSP\nmodels proved useful in obtaining good absorption-line red-\nshifts from galaxies with substantial emission plus strong\nunderlying Balmer absorption. We manually inspected all\nspectra for which the best R-value was less than 10, and\nthose with substantial variation in the redshifts derived\nfrom young and old templates. In all cases, the measured\nredshifts were confirmed. Comparing to redshifts from the\nNFPS (Smith et al. 2004), for 124 galaxies in common, we\nobtain a median offset of 11 kms\u22121 (the new measurements\nlarger), with a scatter of 23 km s\u22121.\nAs a preliminary to measuring velocity dispersions, we\ndetermine the delivered resolution of our spectra as a func-\ntion of wavelength, by comparing the spectra obtained for\na K2 giant, HR7149, with the spectrum for this star in the\nIndo-US stellar library (Valdes et al. 2004). For wavelengths\nof 4500\u20135750 A\u02da, we find a constant 3.0 A\u02da FWHM smoothing\nmust be applied to the Indo-US spectrum for optimal match\nto the AAOmega spectrum. Adding in quadrature the Indo-\nUS resolution (described as 1.2 A\u02da FWHM with \u2018small vari-\nations\u2019), the AAOmega resolution is thus estimated to be\n3.2 A\u02da FWHM (equivalent to \u03c3inst = 82 kms\n\u22121). For 4000\u2013\n4500 A\u02da, the resolution is slightly poorer, \u223c3.7 A\u02da. Consider-\ning the range where the resolution is approximately con-\nstant, and the redshift range spanned by our principal tar-\ngets in Shapley, we select the spectral range 4400\u20135400 A\u02da\nin the rest frame, for determination of the velocity dis-\npersion. This range is fully covered for 461 galaxies with\ncz \u2264 22000 kms\u22121. For velocity dispersion templates, we\nagain employ the MILES SSP models. In the wavelength\nrange of interest, the MILES resolution is 2.4 A\u02da FWHM (fig-\nure 4 of Sa\u00b4nchez\u2013Bla\u00b4zquez et al. 2006c). We must therefore\nsmooth the MILES template spectra by the quadrature dif-\nference (2.1 A\u02da), to approximate a zero-velocity SSP as ob-\nserved by AAOmega.\nDispersions were measured using fxcor again, calibrat-\ning the cross-correlation peak widths to \u03c3 using results from\nartificially broadened templates (e.g. see Wegner et al. 1999).\nThe trial SSPs form a grid with metallicities [Fe\/H]= \u2013\n0.68, \u20130.38, 0.00, +0.20, and ages 1.0, 1.4, 2.0, 2.8, 4.0,\n5.6, 8.0, 11.2, 16.0 and 17.8 Gyr. As for the redshifts, we\nselect the result corresponding to the best-matching SSP\ntemplate. Examination of the results for different templates\nshows that if we had used a single old, solar-metallicity SSP\ntemplate, the dispersions would be strongly biased relative\nto the \u2018best\u2019 SSP, especially for low-mass galaxies. Specifi-\ncally, while for \u03c3 > 100 kms\u22121 the two estimates agree with\nan offset of only \u223c2 per cent, and a scatter of \u223c11 per cent,\nfor \u03c3 = 75 kms\u22121, the median offset is 6 per cent, and for\n\u03c3 = 50 kms\u22121, the bias is 18 per cent. In these cases the\n\u2018best\u2019 \u03c3 is on average smaller than the \u03c3 obtained from a\nsingle old SSP template.\nUncertainties in the velocity dispersions were estimated\nusing Monte Carlo simulations using the error spectra cor-\nresponding to each galaxy. From 51 realisations, we numer-\nically sort the resulting measurements and adopt the 8th\nc\u00a9 2007 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u221220\n6 Russell J.

Signal-to-noise as a function of velocity dispersion for\nthe dataset presented in this paper (filled circles). We show only\nthe \u223c300 galaxies with very low H\u03b1 emission (see later). For com-\nparison, we show the sample of Matkovic\u00b4 & Guzma\u00b4n (2005) as\nsmall crosses, and the NFPS (Smith et al. 2004) as grey points.\nThe kinematically unresolved galaxies (i.e. those with velocity\ndispersions consistent with zero) are placed at an arbitrary loca-\ntion at the left of the panel, separated from the other data by a\nvertical line.\nand 42nd values as an estimate of the 1\u03c3 interval. In this\nprocess the best-matching SSP model is used throughout; er-\nrors associated with selecting the template are therefore not\npropagated into the velocity dispersion error. If the galaxy-\nversus-model cross-correlation peak width is narrower than\nthe model autocorrelation peak width, at the 1\u03c3 lower limit,\nwe classify the galaxy as kinematically unresolved. This is\ntrue for 90 of the total 461 galaxies for which measurements\nwere made. The unresolved galaxies are primarily those with\nbest match to very young (< 2Gyr) SSP models; many also\nhave strong nebular emission lines. This probably results\nlargely from the increased influence of broad A-star Balmer\nabsorption, which degrades our effective instrumental reso-\nlution for ages younger than \u223c3Gyr.\nFigure 2 shows the relationship between measured ve-\nlocity dispersion and the signal-to-noise ratio (S\/N, mea-\nsured over the 4400\u20135400 A\u02da rest-frame interval). The figure\nsuggests that the lowest measurable velocity dispersions in\nour data are 30 \u2212 50 kms\u22121 (roughly half the instrumental\nresolution of \u223c90 km s\u22121), depending on the S\/N achieved.\nFor comparison, we show the same relation for the entire\nNFPS spectroscopic dataset (from Smith et al. 2004). For\ngalaxies in common between the samples, the new data have\na factor of \u223c3.2 higher S\/N (\u223c10 times deeper). A more\ncomparable sample is that compiled for Coma cluster galax-\nies by Matkovic\u00b4 & Guzma\u00b4n (2005). Figure 2 shows that at\ncomparable \u03c3, the S\/N in our spectra is larger by a factor\nof around two.\nIn Figure 3, we compare the new velocity dispersion\nmeasurements with those from NFPS (Smith et al. 2004),\nlog \u03c3  (NFPS)\nlo\ng \n\u03c3\n \n \n(N\nEW\n)\n1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 2.2 2.4 2.6\n1.\n4\n1.\n6\n1.\n8\n2.\n0\n2.\n2\n2.\n4\n2.\n6\ntemplate age > 4Gyr\ntemplate age < 4Gyr\nfit only to old\nfit to all\nFigure 3. Comparison of velocity dispersion measurements with\nthose from NFPS (Smith et al. 2004). The weighted fit to all\npoints is shown by the dotted line. Filled points have best-\nmatching templates older than 4Gyr; the dashed line is a fit to\nthese galaxies only. The solid line indicates equality.\nfor 105 galaxies in common. No aperture corrections need to\nbe applied, since the NFPS fibres are of the same diameter\nas the AAOmega fibres. The comparison is limited by NFPS\nto fairly high luminosity. Moreover there is an explicit bias\nbecause low-\u03c3 galaxies are likely to be unresolved in NFPS,\nand only enter the comparison if errors cause them to scatter\nup to higher \u03c3. We find a median offset of 0.045 dex (\u223c11 per\ncent), with the new measurements consistently smaller. The\nscatter around this offset is 0.068 dex. For low-dispersion\ngalaxies, both the scatter and the average offset increase.\nThe slope of the (error-weighted) fit is 1.06\u00b10.03, indicating\na significant scale change. We attribute this behaviour partly\nto the improved measurement method which matches the\ntemplate to each galaxy, as compared to using a few K-\ngiant templates as in NFPS. In particular, many of the low-\n\u03c3 galaxies are best represented by young SSP models. As\nnoted above, forcing a fit with a K-giant or old SSP will bias\nthe results to higher dispersions in such cases. As a test, we\nrepeat the comparison for only those galaxies with a best-\nmatching template age greater than 4Gyr. The agreement\nis considerably improved, with a scatter of 0.048 dex and\nmedian offset 0.037 dex (\u223c 9 per cent). Moreover the scales\nare consistent (slope 1.00\u00b10.03).\nHereafter in this paper, we prefer to use the velocity\ndispersions derived from the best-matching template. A con-\nsequence is that the \u03c3 scale is slightly stretched relative to\nthe NFPS scale, so that measured correlations with \u03c3 are\nexpected to be flatter than if we had only used K-giant tem-\nplates.\n2.4 Emission line equivalent widths\nSince our sample has not been selected by morphology or\ncolour, it will contain star-forming galaxies as well as pas-\nc\u00a9 2007 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u221220\nShapley Supercluster: Stellar population trends 7\nsive systems. In addition, it has long been known that a\nsubstantial fraction even of morphologically-selected ellipti-\ncals exhibit nebular emission lines such as H\u03b2, [Oiii] 5007,\netc (e.g. Phillips et al. 1986). The line ratios may be char-\nacteristic of LINER excitation, especially in more massive\ngalaxies, or of excitation by ongoing star formation, the lat-\nter more frequently in low-mass galaxies (Nelan et al. 2005;\nYan et al. 2005).\nEmission line measurements are necessary to identify\npassive, non-star-forming galaxies, with minimal nebular\ncontamination in the age-sensitive Balmer lines. As dis-\ncussed in Nelan et al. (2005) and elsewhere, the intrinsic\nvariation among galaxies in the line ratios precludes accu-\nrate correction for emission infilling based on the [Oiii] 5007\nline alone, especially if a wide range in galaxy mass is being\nconsidered. More reliable corrections can, however, be de-\nrived if a wider range of lines are measured, especially if H\u03b1\nis available (e.g. Caldwell et al. 2003).\nTo measure equivalent widths of the principal emission\nlines, it is necessary first to remove the underlying stellar\ncontinuum, especially in the case of the Balmer lines them-\nselves. To this end, we Doppler-corrected each spectrum to\nthe rest frame and divided by the best-fitting MILES SSP\n(as determined from the cross-correlation results), broad-\nened to the measured velocity dispersion. Low-order con-\ntinuum differences were removed using a cubic spline fit.\nEquivalent widths were measured on the ratio spectrum,\nby direct flux summation over an interval equivalent to\n600 kms\u22121 width centred at the wavelength expected from\nthe absorption-line redshift. This measurement window is\nwide enough that modest velocity shifts (\u223c100 km s\u22121) be-\ntween gas and stars introduce only small variations (\u223c10\nper cent) in the equivalent widths. In Section 3 we will\nuse mainly the ratios of neighbouring lines, where the ef-\nfect of such offsets will cancel out. Errors in the equivalent\nwidths were estimated from the pixel-to-pixel variance in\nthe (template-divided) continuum regions.\nIn the blue, the emission lines considered in this paper\nare [Oii] 3727, H\u03b2, and [Oiii] 5007, while in the red spec-\ntra, we use H\u03b1 and [Nii] 6583. Note that the separation of\nthe latter two lines is equivalent to 900 kms\u22121, i.e. larger\nthan the velocity interval used for measuring the equiva-\nlent widths. At the redshift of Shapley, H\u03b1 and [Nii] are af-\nfected by atmospheric absorption bands, especially that due\nto O2 at 6870\u20136955 A\u02da. Thus we need to disentangle three\ncontributions: stellar continuum, nebular emission and at-\nmospheric absorption. To determine the latter, we use the\nobjects with the highest S\/N, and with large velocity dis-\npersion, for which any high-frequency variations must be tel-\nluric in origin. The best-fitting SSP models for these galaxies\nwere Doppler corrected to the observed frame (the opposite\nof the sense used for continuum removal), broadened to the\nappropriate velocity dispersion and divided out of the spec-\ntra. The ratio spectra for each galaxy retain the atmospheric\nfeatures (always at the same wavelengths) and any emis-\nsion lines present (at different wavelengths according to the\nredshift). Median-combining the ratio spectra effectively re-\nmoves the emission component, leaving a smooth continuum\nmodulated by the telluric absorption. The final step was to\nfit out the continuum and create a correction spectrum fixed\nto unity for all pixels below 6800 A\u02da. (We have neglected the\nmuch weaker absorption features at shorter wavelengths).\nTelluric corrections were derived independently for the two\nfields, since these cover different time intervals. A compari-\nson shows that both the overall amplitude and the detailed\nstructure of the O2 band (and the H2O band longwards of\n7130 A\u02da) are very similar between the two fields.\n2.5 Absorption indices\nThe Lick absorption-line indices from HdA1 to Fe5406 were\nmeasured using indexf (see Cenarro et al. 2001), on the\nflux-calibrated spectra, at the native spectral resolution of\n\u223c3.2 A\u02da. The indices Mg1, Mg2, Fe5270 and Fe5335 are not\nreported here, since at the redshift of Shapley, these are con-\ntaminated by the 5577 A\u02da sky emission for a large fraction of\nthe galaxies. We use the passband definitions of Trager et\nal. (1998), and the the conventional units, i.e. magnitudes\nfor CN1, CN2 and angstroms for all others. Uncertainties\nare estimated from the error spectrum for each galaxy. Be-\nfore the indices can be compared against spectral synthesis\nmodels, three distinct corrections must be considered: cor-\nrection to zero-velocity broadening, correction to the spec-\ntral resolution of the models, and correction to match the\ninstrumental response curve used in the models, if this is\nnot a fluxed system (e.g. the Lick\/IDS system).\n2.5.1 Velocity broadening corrections\nThe measured absorption line indices differ from those com-\nputed by spectral synthesis models, due to broadening by the\nline-of-sight velocity distribution function. For an isolated\nabsorption line, increasing \u03c3 causes the line to \u2018leak\u2019 from\nthe central index band, depressing the measured index. With\nfurther broadening, the absorption itself spreads into the\npseudo-continuum bands, further reducing the measured ab-\nsorption. In a complex spectrum with many overlapping fea-\ntures, the effect of velocity broadening can be assessed only\nempirically by comparison to artificially-broadened template\nspectra.\nMost studies in the field have derived velocity broad-\nening corrections (VBCs) to the indices, based on measure-\nments on artificially broadened spectra of template stars ob-\ntained with the same instrumentation as the galaxies (e.g.\nGonza\u00b4lez 1993; Davies, Sadler & Peletier 1993; Trager et al.\n1998). Alternatively, a library of SSP template models can\nbe used to cover a wider range in spectral type, and provide\na better match to the composite spectra of real galaxies\n(e.g. Kuntschner 2004). The correction described by each\ntemplate spectrum is usually normalised by the index value\nat zero velocity dispersion, and the results from different\ntemplates averaged into a single multiplicative correction\ndescribing the ratio A number of indices (most notably the\nH\u03b3 and H\u03b4 indices of Worthey & Ottoviani 1997) can take\na range of values which span or approach zero. Under such\nconditions the usual multiplicative correction fails, and in\nthese cases an additive correction, based on I(\u03c3)\u2212 I(\u03c3 = 0)\nhas generally been used.\nIn general, it is not clear whether one should apply an\n1 We use roman type, e.g. HdA for the names of the conventional\nline-strength indices, while H\u03b4 refers to the line itself, whether in\nabsorption or emission.\nc\u00a9 2007 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u221220\n8 Russell J. Smith et al.\nadditive or a multiplicative correction for any given index. In\nthe simplest case, where a single correction curve is used for\nall the target galaxies, a multiplicative correction may intro-\nduce systematic errors as a function of linestrength (and thus\nindirectly as a function of \u03c3). More recently, many works\nhave derived corrections for each galaxy based on a model\ntemplate chosen to match that galaxy (e.g. Kuntschner et al.\n2006; Sa\u00b4nchez-Bla\u00b4zquez et al. 2006a; Kelson et al. 2006). In\nthis paper, we adopt an alternative approach to the VBCs,\nwhich allows a general and consistent treatment of all the\nindices.\nOur corrections are based on a range of MILES SSP\nmodel templates (Vazdekis et al. 2007), with ages 3\u201318Gyr\nand metallicities [Fe\/H] = \u20130.38, 0.00 and +0.20. We smooth\nthe template spectra to mimic both the AAOmega instru-\nmental resolution, and also the degradation caused by ve-\nlocity broadening in steps from zero to 500 kms\u22121. (We ne-\nglect any higher order moments of the line-of-sight velocity\ndistribution, but in principle the method could be general-\nized to allow for these.) The indices are measured on the\nbroadened spectra. For each step in \u03c3, the broad coverage\nof spectral types yields a wide range in index value. At each\nvalue of \u03c3, we then simply compare the index measured on\nthe velocity broadened spectrum, INat(\u03c3), with that mea-\nsured only allowing instrumental resolution, INat(\u03c3 = 0).\n(The subscript \u2018Nat\u2019 here refers to measurements at the na-\ntive resolution of the spectra.) For most of the standard\nindices, this comparison yields a closely linear relation such\nthat INat(\u03c3 = 0) = aINat(\u03c3)+b (at fixed \u03c3), with very small\nscatter. This can be applied as a correction for the indices\nmeasured on the galaxy spectra. The coefficients a and b for\neach galaxy can be interpolated from the steps in \u03c3 used for\nsmoothing the templates. In most cases the SSP models span\nthe range of the measured values. Where this is not the case\n(e.g. the highest Mgb5177 values, for \u03b1-enhanced galaxies),\nthe high degree of linearity in the corrections suggests that\na small extrapolation is probably safe. In applying the cor-\nrections, we account for the effect of the linear correction to\nthe index error. The uncertainty in the velocity dispersion\n(and hence the coefficients a and b) could also be propa-\ngated to the index error, but in practice this contribution is\nnegligible compared to the index error.\nThe left panel of Figure 4 shows the corrections derived\nfor the Mgb5177 index, for \u03c3 = 100, 200, 300 kms\u22121. In this\ncase, the correction INat(\u03c3 = 0) \u2212 INat(\u03c3) increases with\nindex strength such that our correction is almost identical\nto the usual multiplicative form. In Figure 5 we present the\nbest linear corrections at \u03c3 = 300 kms\u22121, for a selection\nof the principal indices, with a comparison to the equiva-\nlent pure multiplicative and pure additive corrections. The\nfigures demonstrate that the new approach yields linear cor-\nrections which hold to a high degree of precision over a very\nwide range of spectral types. By contrast, for some indices,\nthe best multiplicative and best additive corrections can be\naccurate only over a limited range of the index value itself.\nAs an example, consider the fairly narrow iron index\nFe5270. The linear and multiplicative corrections (as usu-\nally employed for this index) reproduce the observed values\nover the whole range of SSPs. By contrast, in the panel for\nHdF, we find that the multiplicative correction fails badly,\nas expected for this index. The additive correction, as usu-\nally employed, is as successful as our linear fit, although\nin both cases there is some metallicity dependence in the\nresiduals. In these cases, our results support the form of\ncorrection generally adopted. Two counter-examples, where\nour scheme suggests a different form of correction than the\nstandard method, are HgF and G4300. For HgF, the tra-\nditional additive correction is a poor fit to the broadened\nspectra. Our linear correction is much closer to the mul-\ntiplicative form, but is a better fit than multiplicative for\nthe most Balmer-strong (young or metal-poor) models. For\nG4300, previous work has generally applied a multiplicative\ncorrection. Our analysis shows that an additive correction\nis much preferred for this index. However, the index has\na complicated metallicity-dependent behaviour which is not\naccurately reproduced even by our linear correction scheme.\nIn summary, the new formulation of the VBCs described\nhere, while not much more complicated or difficult to im-\nplement than the traditional approach, improves upon the\ntraditional method in at least two regards: (i) greater gen-\nerality, requiring no subjective preference for additive or\nmultiplicative corrections, and (ii) ready applicability over\na wide range of spectral types for most indices. Our ap-\nproach should be equivalent to the more modern methods\nwhich derive corrections from matched template spectra. We\ncontend, however, that describing the VBCs in terms of a\nmapping from observed index to the value at \u03c3 = 0 is a more\nnatural way to present the correction.\n2.5.2 Instrumental resolution correction\nIn order to compare to models defined at the resolution of\nthe Lick\/IDS stellar library, such as those of Worthey (1994),\nThomas et al. (2003, 2004), and Schiavon (2007), it is neces-\nsary to match the 8\u201312 A\u02da wavelength-dependent spectral res-\nolution of the IDS instrument. Traditionally this is achieved\nby artificially broadening the spectra prior to measuring the\nindices. A serious drawback is that this results in redistribu-\ntion of any non-uniform noise in the spectra. For example, in\nintermediate-redshift observations, residuals from subtract-\ning narrow sky lines would be smeared over \u223c20 A\u02da intervals.\nIn the data described here, noise non-uniformity is less se-\nvere, but arises from the blocks of bad columns in the detec-\ntor. Since our observed wavelength range was shifted mid-\nway through the observations there are (usually) no pixels\nwith unknown values, but in certain regions the variance is\ndoubled since only half the integration yields good data.\nAn alternative approach, as pointed out by Kelson et\nal. (2006), is to subsume the resolution correction into the\nsame process as the VBCs. The correction to the Lick res-\nolution can be obtained by measuring indices on the tem-\nplate SSP models after broadening to the Lick resolution,\nbut without any velocity broadening, denoted ILick(\u03c3 = 0).\nThe smoothing required for each index is as tabulated by\nSchiavon (2007), based on fig. 7 of Worthey & Ottoviani\n(1997). Corrections from observed to zero velocity disper-\nsion can then be established at the Lick instrumental reso-\nlution, in the same way as before, by fitting a linear relation\nILick(\u03c3 = 0) = aINat(\u03c3) + b, at fixed \u03c3 The right panel of\nFigure 4 shows the correction for Mgb5177 as an example.\nSince the Lick resolution is equivalent to \u03c3 \u223c 200 kms\u22121,\nour higher-resolution measurements are subject to a nega-\ntive correction at low \u03c3 and to a positive correction at high\n\u03c3.\nc\u00a9 2007 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u221220\nShapley Supercluster: Stellar population trends 9\nObserved   INat(\u03c3)\nCo\nrre\nct\nio\nn \n  I\nN\na\nt(\u03c3\n=\n0)\n\u2212\nI N\na\nt(\u03c3\n)\n1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5\n0.\n0\n0.\n5\nMgb5177 correction to sigma=0 at native resolution\n[Fe\/H] = \u22120.38[Fe\/H] =   0.00[Fe\/H] = +0.20\n100\n200\n300\nObserved   INat(\u03c3)\nCo\nrre\nct\nio\nn \n  I\nLi\nck\n(\u03c3=\n0)\n\u2212\nI N\na\nt(\u03c3\n)\n1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5\n0.\n0\n0.\n5\nMgb5177 correction to sigma=0 at lick resolution\n[Fe\/H] = \u22120.38[Fe\/H] =   0.00[Fe\/H] = +0.20\n100\n200\n300\nFigure 4. Left panel: velocity broadening correction for Mgb5177, correcting to \u03c3 = 0 at the native resolution of the spectra. For\neach index, we plot INat(\u03c3 = 0) \u2212 INat(\u03c3), where INat(\u03c3 = 0) is the index measured on the MILES model SSP spectra with no\nvelocity broadening (but smoothed to our native instrumental resolution), and INat(\u03c3) the index measured after broadening to \u03c3 =\n100, 200, 300 km s\u22121, as well as to the native AAOmega resolution. The latter is thus the index value as \u2018observed\u2019. Points show the\ncorrections for SSPs with [Fe\/H]=\u20130.38 (squares), 0.00 (triangles) and +0.20 (circles). The thick grey line shows zero correction. Solid\nlines are linear fits to the relation given by the MILES SSPs. Right panel: Equivalent corrections to \u03c3 = 0 at the Lick resolution. In this\ncase, INat(\u03c3) is, as before, the index after broadening by \u03c3 the native instrumental kernel, while ILick(\u03c3 = 0) is measured with the Lick\ninstrumental smoothing, but with no velocity broadening.\nTo recap, our corrections to zero velocity dispersion and\nto the Lick resolution are handled in a single step. The\ncorrections can be applied without smoothing the observed\ngalaxy spectra, correctly preserving the noise properties of\nthe data.\n2.5.3 No calibration to the Lick system\nFinally, the most widely used models of the past few years\nare those of Thomas et al. (2003, 2004), which are based\non the Lick\/IDS stellar library (Worthey et al. 1994). This\nlibrary is not flux calibrated, instead being defined by the\nwavelength response of an instrument of only historical sig-\nnificance. We did not expend valuable telescope time observ-\ning Lick standard stars to match this system. Instead, when\nwe compare to the Thomas et al. models we will employ\nthem in a relative sense only. This can be done either by\nconsidering only the slope of, for instance, the index\u2212\u03c3 re-\nlations (as in Nelan et al. 2005), or by imposing zero-point\nshifts to fix a set of the most massive galaxies to match\nfiducial values for age, [Z\/H] and [\u03b1\/Fe]. Ultimately, we an-\nticipate re-analysing the current data in the context of a\nnew generation of models now being developed (e.g. Schi-\navon 2007; Vazdekis et al. 2007) which are tied to carefully\nflux-calibrated stellar libraries (e.g. Jones 1999; Valdes et al.\n2004; Sa\u00b4nchez\u2013Bla\u00b4zquez et al. 2006c).\n2.5.4 Comparison with NFPS\nFigure 6 compares the new index data with that of NFPS\n(Nelan et al. 2005) for 78 galaxies common to the two sam-\nples. The comparisons are limited by the uncertainties in\nNFPS, which are typically three times larger than those in\nthe new measurements. In the case of Mgb5177, which is\nwell measured in both studies, the data show a zero-point\noffset of 0.10\u00b10.04. In the other indices shown, no significant\noffset is observed.\n3 EMISSION LINE ANALYSIS\nIn this section, we analyse the emission line equivalent\nwidths, primarily to determine a criterion for selecting an\nemission-free galaxy sample. The incidence of emission lines\nin cluster members is also of interest in itself, reflecting the\nongoing consumption of gas in the cluster environment.\nIn the following sections, we will use indices measuring\nthe Balmer lines (specifically Hbeta, HgF, HdF) as age indi-\ncators for the galaxy sample, on the assumption that these\nare dominated by absorption in stars near the main-sequence\nturn-off. If the galaxy contains regions of star formation, or\nhosts an active galactic nucleus (AGN or LINER), then the\nBalmer lines are contaminated by emission, yielding weaker\nnet absorption and spuriously old age estimates. Such galax-\nies must either be corrected for the effects of emission or\nexcluded from the sample entirely. Many older studies chose\nto correct for H\u03b2 emission by assuming a constant ratio\nbetween the [Oiii] 5007 and H\u03b2 lines (e.g. H\u03b2\/[Oiii]= 0.6,\nTrager et al. 2000a). However, the measured line ratios,\neven for red-sequence galaxies, span a wide range around\nthis value, and moreover vary systematically with galaxy\nmass (Nelan et al. 2005; Yan et al. 2006). Specifically, cor-\nrection using [Oiii] under-corrects the emission at low mass\nand over-corrects at high mass. Using [Oiii] alone to select\nc\u00a9 2007 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u221220\n10 Russell J.

Either case could result in a spuriously\nflattened age\u2212\u03c3 relation.\nA more useful diagnostic, when available, is a measure-\nment of H\u03b1 emission, since the H\u03b1\/H\u03b2 ratio should be much\nmore stable than, for instance [Oiii]\/H\u03b2, which depends\nstrongly on the source of excitation. Moreover, nebular emis-\nsion at H\u03b1 dominates over the stellar absorption even for\nvery low-levels of star formation or AGN luminosity, provid-\ning powerful leverage on the contamination of higher-order\nlines, and robustness against errors in continuum removal\n(e.g. Caldwell et al. 2003).\nThe sample used in this section comprises 342 galaxies\nselected from the NFPS imaging, with redshifts compatible\nc\u00a9 2007 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u221220\nShapley Supercluster: Stellar population trends 11\nMgb5177  (NEW)\nM\ngb\n51\n77\n  (N\nFP\nS)\n3 4 5 6\n3\n4\n5\n6\nHgF  (NEW)\nH\ngF\n  (N\nFP\nS)\n\u22123 \u22122 \u22121 0 1\n\u2212\n3\n\u2212\n2\n\u2212\n1\n0\n1\nFe5015  (NEW)\nFe\n50\n15\n  (N\nFP\nS)\n2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\nFigure 6. Comparison of the new index measurements with data from NFPS (Nelan et al. 2005), for three representative indices. There\nare 78 galaxies in common which meet our emission criterion (EW(H\u03b1)<0.5 A\u02da). The line indicates equality.\nwith membership of the supercluster (velocities in the range\n11670\u201317233 kms\u22121, justified in the following section). H\u03b1\nemission is detected with EW(H\u03b1)> 0.5 A\u02da, for 110 objects\ni.e. 32 per cent. With this threshold, the detection of H\u03b1 is\nalways significant at the > 3\u03c3 level. Of these 110, emission\nis also detected with S\/N>3 in H\u03b2 for 85 per cent, in [Oiii]\n5007 for 89 per cent, in [Nii] 6583 for 96 per cent and in [Oii]\n3727 for \u223c80 per cent. The converse proportions are more\ncritical: we are most concerned to ensure that the measured\nH\u03b2 absorption is not substantially contaminated by nebu-\nlar emission. We prefer not to use the directly-measured H\u03b2\nemission to impose a sample cut, so that errors in selecting\nthe best-fitting continuum template are not propagated di-\nrectly to the absorption line measurements. However, we can\nuse these data to assess the reliability of selecting accord-\ning to the other lines. For 232 galaxies without detected\nH\u03b1 (\u2018H\u03b1-clean\u2019), only ten (i.e. 4 per cent ) show signifi-\ncant (S\/N>3) H\u03b2 emission. The equivalent fraction for 269\n[Oiii]-clean objects is 10 per cent, while for 241 [Oii]-clean\nobjects, 12 per cent show H\u03b2 emission. (In defining clean\nsamples from [Oii] and [Oiii], we did not impose an abso-\nlute EW cut comparable to the 0.5 A\u02da applied for H\u03b1, since in\nthese cases there is not a strongly-varying underlying stellar\nabsorption line.) Given the direct astrophysical connection\nbetween H\u03b1 and H\u03b2, we would have expected this to be\nthe most accurate indicator for nebular contamination. The\ntests presented in this paragraph demonstrate in addition\nthat it is also the most sensitive indicator from a practical\nperspective, admitting a factor 2\u20133 times fewer galaxies with\nH\u03b2 emission than the available lines in the blue spectra.\nNext we consider the origin of the emission lines, i.e\nwhether they are due to star formation or to AGN\/LINERs.\nThe upper left panel of Figure 7 shows the classical emission-\nline diagnostic plane of Baldwin, Phillips & Terlevich (1981),\nhereafter the BPT diagram. (Note that while ratios of line\nfluxes are usually used in such diagrams, we use ratios of\nequivalent widths. Since we restrict this analysis to line-\npairs which are close in wavelength, the ratios differ only at\nthe \u223c 0.02 dex level from flux ratios.) Normal star-forming\ngalaxies are distinguished from AGN\/LINERs by their lower\n[Nii] 6583\/H\u03b1 and [Oiii] 5007\/H\u03b2 ratios. Among the lines\nproposed to discriminate between the excitation mecha-\nnisms, we plot those from the theoretical modelling of Kew-\nley et al. (2001) and Stasin\u00b4ska et al. (2006), and the empiri-\ncal line of Kauffmann et al. (2003), derived from SDSS galax-\nies. The Shapley galaxies populate both the star-forming and\nthe AGN loci. In classifying the emission source, we adopt\nthe Stasin\u00b4ska et al. criterion, which is the \u2018strictest\u2019, in the\nsense of assigning fewest galaxies to the normal star-forming\nclass. For 23 galaxies with H\u03b1 emission, we do not detect\nall of the other three lines with S\/N>3 as required for this\nclassification method, but eight of these can be confidently\nassigned to the AGN class based on [Nii]\/H\u03b1 alone. Using\nthese criteria we classify 34 galaxies as AGN\/LINERs (31\nper cent of all the emission-line galaxies), and 61 objects\n(55 per cent) as pure star-forming galaxies. The remaining\n15 unclassified galaxies have S\/N<3 in one or more of the\nlines used, and ambiguous [Nii]\/H\u03b1 ratio.\nThe two categories of emission-line galaxy are dif-\nferently distributed within the luminosity range spanned\nby our sample. In the upper right panel of Figure 7, we\nshow the fraction of galaxies (within the NFPS-selected,\nsupercluster-member sample) which have H\u03b1 emission, sep-\narated by BPT-classification, as a function of R-band lu-\nminosity. Each luminosity bin represents \u223c70 galaxies. The\noverall emission-line fraction is approximately constant at\n\u223c30 per cent, but the mix between star-forming galaxies\nand AGN\/LINERs changes dramatically as a function of\nluminosity. Most of the emission population in the highest-\nluminosity bin are AGN, while star-forming objects predom-\ninate among the faint emission-line galaxies. The break be-\ntween these regimes occurs at MR \u2248 \u221220.5, corresponding\nto luminosity \u223c 1010L\u2299 or a stellar mass \u223c 10\n10.4M\u2299. This\ntransition mass is in excellent agreement with the result ob-\ntained by Kauffmann et al. (2003) for a much larger sample\nof galaxies from SDSS.\nThe above analysis used a sample which includes blue\nsupercluster members. The lower panels of Figure 7 show\nthe same diagrams after imposing an additional selection for\nonly the red-sequence galaxies (B\u2212R within 0.15 of the fit in\nFigure 1, 291 galaxies). The overall emission fraction on the\nred sequence is 20 per cent. As expected, the star-forming\nc\u00a9 2007 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u221220\n12 Russell J.

By contrast the systematic change\nin H\u03b1\/H\u03b2 is less than a factor of two.

The plot limits are such that most of the emission\nline galaxies lie outside of the range shown.\nMR \u2248 \u221220.5 as before. However, given the systematic trend\nalong the sequence with luminosity, it is clear that the AGN\nthreshold luminosity depends quite sensitively on the classi-\nfication line adopted (e.g. using the Kewley et al. line would\nresult in a cut-off at higher luminosity). Moreover, the ap-\nparently continuous distribution in the BPT plane suggests\nthat imposing a classification may even not be justified at\nall, at least for red galaxies.\nTo summarize, our analysis reconfirms that the use of\na constant factor relative to [Oiii] is not a viable means\nof either correcting for or selecting against nebular emis-\nsion contamination. We have shown that most galaxies with\ncontaminated H\u03b2 can be readily identified from their H\u03b1\nemission. In the present paper we opt not to make an emis-\nsion correction to the absorption indices, but rather to use\nthe H\u03b1 measurments to exclude emitting galaxies from the\nsample entirely.\n4 THE FINAL SAMPLE\nThis section defines explicitly the sample of low-emission\nsupercluster members, and tabulates the data for these ob-\njects, as analysed in Section 5.\nRecall that after removing galaxies whose entire spec-\ntra were rejected (stars, superpositions, \u2018fringed\u2019 spectra),\nthe sample comprises 540 galaxies, with 403 selected from\nthe NFPS imaging and 138 from 2MASS. The sample to be\nanalysed in this paper will be the subset of NFPS-selected\nobjects having very low levels of nebular emission, and hav-\ning redshifts compatible with membership of the Shapley\nSupercluster. Table 1 shows how the various selection crite-\nria affect the sample size.\nThe emission selection is based on H\u03b1 as justified in\nSection 3. In defining the low-emission sample, we use the\nsame cut of 0.5 A\u02da in EW(H\u03b1), as used in the line-ratio anal-\nysis. Figure 8 demonstrates that this limit is effective in\nseparating the tail of low-emission galaxies from the bulk\nof apparently emission-free objects. Note that the H\u03b1 cut\nis equivalent to 0.1\u20130.2 A\u02da in H\u03b2, and is thus more restric-\ncz [1000 km\/s]\nN\nga\nla\nxy\n \n \npe\nr 2\n00\n k\nm\n\/s\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\nFigure 9.Redshift distribution of the observed targets.

After an iterative 3\u03c3 clipping, the redshift dis-\ntribution has median 14451 km s\u22121, with a dispersion of\n927 kms\u22121. A total of 448 observed galaxies (342 NFPS\nplus 106 2MASS) lie within the 3\u03c3 range, i.e. 11670\u2013\n17233 kms\u22121, which we adopt henceforth as the super-\ncluster redshift limits. In the foreground, there are two\ngalaxies with redshifts \u223c4000 kms\u22121, characteristic of the\nHydra\u2013Centaurus Supercluster. A few galaxies have veloci-\nties \u223c11000 kms\u22121, and are excluded by our limits. (These\nare probably associated with a foreground structure includ-\ning the rich cluster Abell 3571). A tail of background galax-\nies extends to z \u223c 0.3, with a number of groups appar-\nent, e.g. at \u223c23000 kms\u22121, \u223c27000 kms\u22121, \u223c39000 kms\u22121,\n\u223c43000 km s\u22121, and \u223c52000 kms\u22121. Several of these fea-\ntures have already been noted from wide-field redshift sur-\nveys of the region (e.g. Proust et al. 2006).\nThe final sample analysed in this paper comprises 232\nNFPS-selected galaxies meeting both the emission and the\nredshift criteria, of which 198 have measured velocity disper-\nsions (i.e. are not \u2018unresolved\u2019). The 34 unresolved galaxies\nwould have an average of \u03c3 = 50 kms\u22121, if at the median\nof the MR \u2212 \u03c3 relationship. However, it is likely that they\nare unresolved precisely because their \u03c3 is lower than the\naverage for their luminosity.\nReferring to the solid points in Figure 1, we note that\nalthough no explicit colour selection has been imposed, the\nredshift and emission cuts result in a sample which is effec-\ntively limited to the cluster red sequence. A robust fit to\nthe B \u2212 R colours yields a slope of 0.043 \u00b1 0.005 per mag-\nnitude in R, with a (galaxy-by-galaxy) scatter of 0.07mag.\nThe culled final sample corresponds to \u223c35% of the NFPS\nR < 18 input catalogue. Assuming that the observed and\nunobserved galaxies have similar redshift and emission-line\ndistributions, the final sample covers \u223c60% of all passive\nsupercluster members within the NFPS imaging region.\nThe median measured velocity dispersion is \u03c3 =\nc\u00a9 2007 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u221220\n14 Russell J. Smith et al.\n104 kms\u22121, and the 90 per cent range is 39\u2013228 kms\u22121.\nThe median error in the HgF index is 0.10 A\u02da (0.20 A\u02da) for\nvelocity dispersions above (below) 100 kms\u22121. Since the\nThomas et al. (2004) models yield an age-sensitivity of\n\u2202(HgF)\/\u2202(log Age) \u2248 \u22122.6, these values correspond to typ-\nical formal errors of \u223c9 per cent (\u223c20 per cent) in age.\nThe fully-corrected line-strength data for the final sam-\nple are presented in Tables 2\u20134.\n5 RESULTS\nIn this section, we determine the scaling of each of the Lick\nline-strength indices as a function of velocity dispersion, and\nuse these to infer average scaling relations for age, metallic-\nity and \u03b1\/Fe ratios through comparison to the models of\nThomas et al. (2003, 2004). The method is essentially that\nof Nelan et al. (2005).\n5.1 Index\u2212\u03c3 relations\nFor this analysis, we use the sample of low-emission super-\ncluster members, tabulated in the previous section. The \u2018un-\nresolved\u2019 galaxies (i.e. those which do not have measured \u03c3)\nare, of course, not used in the index\u2212\u03c3 fits, leaving a sam-\nple of 198 galaxies. Moreover, on an index-by-index basis,\nwe remove galaxies with errors greater than four times the\nmedian (typically only three or four galaxies). The fits were\nweighted according to the error in the line-strengths (ve-\nlocity dispersion errors are neglected). An iterative scheme\nwas used, in which galaxies deviating from the relation by\nmore than four times the intrinsic scatter (see below), and\nby more than twice their measurement error, were rejected\nin each step. However, our results are not very sensitive to\nwhether this outlier rejection is applied or not. The total\nand intrinsic scatter around the relation was derived using\noutlier-robust methods: \u03c3tot is the standard deviation of a\nGaussian distribution having the same interquartile range\nas the residuals from the index\u2212\u03c3 relation; \u03c3int is the ad-\nditional Gaussian scatter required, in quadrature with the\nmeasurement errors, to reproduce the observed interquar-\ntile range. For comparison to earlier work on more luminous\ngalaxy samples, the relations were also derived for the 104\ngalaxies with \u03c3 > 100 kms\u22121. We have also fit index\u2212\u03c3 re-\nlations using the traditional VBCs, i.e. a single additive or\nmultiplicative correction irrespective applied to all galaxies\nof given \u03c3. The new VBCs affect the slopes by <\n\u223c\n3%, with\nthe exceptions of: HdA 7% shallower with new correction,\nCa4227 11% shallower and G4300 8% steeper.\nThe index\u2212\u03c3 relations are presented in Figure 10, and\nsummarized in Table 5. Comparison of our \u03c3 > 100 km s\u22121\nslopes with the relations tabulated by Nelan et al. reveals\nthat the slopes are typically \u223c20 per cent flatter in the\npresent work. The only indices not consistent with this factor\nare CN1 and Ca4227. The difference in slope is in the sense\nexpected from the change in velocity dispersion scale, but\nlarger than suggested by the \u03c3 comparison in Section 2.3.\nFor Ca4227, the resolution corrections applied by Nelan et\nal. were erroneous, generating a sharp increase in the index\nat high \u03c3 and consequently a much steeper slope. Ca4227\nis the only case where this effect is non-negligible, since its\npass-bands are much narrower than any other of the other\nindices. (Note that Ca4227 was not used in the Nelan et\nal. stellar population analysis.) For CN1, where there is ap-\nparently some curvature in the relation, our slope for the\n\u03c3 > 100 kms\u22121 set is slightly steeper than in Nelan et al.,\nwhile our slope for the full sample is flatter.\n5.2 The stellar population scaling relations\nConsideration of the index\u2212\u03c3 slopes, and comparison to\nstellar population models, provides a means to determine the\naverage scaling of age and metal abundances as a function of\nmass (e.g. Nelan et al. 2005; Clemens et al. 2006). Although\nusing only the slopes forces the scaling relations to a very\nsimple (and perhaps inaccurate) form, this is an explicitly\nrelative method, and therefore is insensitive to zero-point\noffsets in either the data or the models. Further discussion\nof the merits and limitations of the method can be found in\nNelan et al. and in Smith et al. (2006).\nFrom the Thomas et al. (2003, 2004) model grids, we de-\ntermine the responses of each index to the three population\nparameters by fitting a linear relation I = RAge log Age +\nRZ\/H[Z\/H] + R\u03b1\/Fe[\u03b1\/Fe], for models with age 3\u201315Gyr,\n[\u03b1\/Fe]=0.0-0.5 and [Z\/H]=\u22120.33, 0.00,+0.35,+0.67. This is\na slight improvement on the original method where fiducial\nvalues were assumed for two parameters when deriving the\nindex response of the third parameter. For reference, we pro-\nvide the new responses in Table 6.\nTo recover the scaling relations of the three stellar pop-\nulation parameters, we consider the observed slopes for nine\nof our index\u2212\u03c3 relations (HdF, HgF, Hbeta, CN1, Fe4383,\nMgb5177, Fe4668, Fe5015 and Fe5406). These are chosen to\nbe mainly non-redundant (e.g. only one H\u03b3 index is used),\nto avoid indices which are contaminated by the 5577 A\u02da sky\nline in many cases (i.e. Fe5270 and Fe5335), and to avoid in-\ndices with strong dependence on Ca abundance2. The G4300\nindex is not used in this analysis since it disagrees strongly\nwith the other indices, and severely degrades the fit qual-\nity if included. The G4300-\u03c3 relation is much flatter than\nexpected from the other indices, perhaps due to the high-\nmetallicity saturation mentioned by Schiavon (2007).\nThe scaling relations derived through the comparison of\nmeasured slopes with the model-derived responses are:\nAge \u221d \u03c30.52\u00b10.06, Z\/H \u221d \u03c30.34\u00b10.04, \u03b1\/Fe \u221d \u03c30.23\u00b10.04.\nThese scalings can be used to predict the index\u2212\u03c3 slopes\nfor a wider range of indices, as given in Table 6, which can\nbe directly compared to the observed slopes. The quoted er-\nrors are the formal uncertainty in the fit, and do not include\nmodelling uncertainties such as the scatter when different\nindices are used for the fit. The latter can be estimated con-\nservatively by repeating the exercise for all non-degenerate\n\u201ctriplets\u201d chosen from the above indices. We impose the con-\ndition that each triplet must include one Balmer line, one\nindex from the set (Mgb5177, CN1, Fe4668) where R\u03b1\/Fe\nhas the same sign as RZ\/H and one from the set (Fe4383,\nFe5015, Fe5406) where [\u03b1\/Fe] and [Z\/H] responses differ in\nsign.

Index-\u03c3 relations. The lines indicate the fits to all of the data (solid) and to the \u03c3 > 100 km s\u22121 subset (dashed). The objects\nwith unresolved velocity dispersions (to the left of the dotted line) are not used when fitting the relations. Open symbols represent these\nand also other galaxies excluded from the fit by an iterative outlier rejection scheme.\nover all 27 of these triplets is 0.10 for age, 0.07 for [Z\/H]\nand 0.06 for [\u03b1\/Fe], which may be taken as representative\nof the systematic errors. As a further test, we can use all six\nmetal lines plus each Balmer line in turn. In this case, the\nage exponents are 0.59 using HdF, 0.44 using HgF and 0.54\nusing Hbeta, with random errors 0.08 in each case. Fitting\nthe scaling relations to the index\u2212\u03c3 slopes derived using the\n\u201ctraditional\u201d VBCs (i.e. a common additive or multiplica-\ntive correction function for all spectral types), the exponents\nchange by less than 0.01 relative to our default case. Thus we\ndo not support the claim by Kelson et al. (2006, their Figure\n10) that subtle differences in VBC method can dramatically\naffect the derived relations.\nApplying the same method to our index\u2212\u03c3 slopes de-\nrived from the high-mass (\u03c3 > 100 km s\u22121) subset, we ob-\ntain:\nAge \u221d \u03c30.64\u00b10.12, Z\/H \u221d \u03c30.38\u00b10.09, \u03b1\/Fe \u221d \u03c30.36\u00b10.07.\nThe high-\u03c3 age and [Z\/H] trends are consistent with the full\nsample within 1\u03c3, while there is a \u223c2\u03c3 change in slope for\n[\u03b1\/Fe]. The latter suggests a flattening of the [\u03b1\/Fe]\u2212\u03c3 re-\nlation towards low masses. The difference is driven by the\n\u03b1-sensitive Mgb5177 and CN1 indices. In particular a curva-\nture, or change in slope around log \u03c3 = 2, is visually appre-\nciable in the CN index panels of Figure 10. Similar behaviour\ncan be seen in the data of Sa\u00b4nchez-Bla\u00b4zquez et al. (2006a,\nfigure 6).\nThe recovered parameter scaling relations from the\nabove analysis are summarized in the upper section of Ta-\nble 7.\nc\u00a9 2007 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u221220\nShapley Supercluster: Stellar population trends 17\nTable 5.

The analyses were based\neither on the index\u2212\u03c3 slopes method, or on explicit inversion\nof model grids. Most of the studies used the Thomas et al.\n(2003, 2004) models. Exceptions are Graves et al. (2007)\n(based on models of Schiavon 2007), Sa\u00b4nchez-Bla\u00b4zquez et\nal. (2006b) (based on Vazdekis et al. 2007) and Clemens et\nal. 2006 (based on Annibali et al. 2005). Before discussing\nthe comparisons we again emphasize that our sample spans\na factor of \u223c6 in velocity dispersion, compared to a factor\n\u223c2\u20133 in the other work.\nThe most comparable studies, using similar galaxy se-\nlection criteria, and similar methods, are those from the\nNFPS (Nelan et al. 2005; Smith et al. 2006). The two NFPS\nanalyses were based on slightly different samples and data\ntreatment, and the differences between their results proba-\nbly reflect the level of systematic errors in the method. Our\nresults from this paper, for the high-\u03c3 subset, are within\nthe range spanned by the two NFPS analyses. For the full\nsample, i.e. extending into the low-\u03c3 regime, the trends are\nslightly flatter than in NFPS, especially for [\u03b1\/Fe]. A possi-\nble change in some of the index\u2212\u03c3 slopes has already been\ncommented on, but the change in scaling relations may also\nreflect the difference in \u03c3 scales discussed in Section 2.3. Fi-\nnally, the inclusion of the low mass galaxies may be compro-\nmising a key assumption of the slopes method, namely that\nthe grids are linear and parallel over the index range spanned\nby the data. In Paper II, we will bypass this requirement by\nexplicitly inverting the model grids on a galaxy-by-galaxy\nbasis.\nAmong other work, results based on samples from SDSS\nare similar to NFPS and to the present survey, in targeting\nred-sequence or early-type galaxies without detailed visual\ninspection. The work of Bernardi et al. (2006) agrees fairly\nwell with our results and with NFPS, although all three pa-\nrameter slopes are rather steeper (we have quoted their re-\nsults using HgF as the age indicator; their age slope is much\nsteeper when Hbeta is used.) The work of Clemens et al.\n(2006) agrees in age slope, but yields much steeper [Z\/H] and\n[\u03b1\/Fe] scalings, which may result from the different models\nthey use, tracking the C abundance separately from Mg and\nFe. In comparing between NFPS, SDSS and our new sam-\nple, note that the mass baseline covered by SDSS is a factor\nof \u223c3 narrower. Most recently, Graves et al. (2007) have ob-\ntained a relatively shallow age slope and steeper metallicity\nslope from a colour- and emission-selected SDSS sample.\nThe compilation of Thomas et al. (2005) yields scal-\nings close to those of NFPS, when a fit is made to their\nwhole sample, rather than excluding young low-mass galax-\nies in advance as in their paper. The work of Caldwell et al.\nc\u00a9 2007 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u221220\n18 Russell J. Smith et al.\n(2003), which was among the first to obtain age estimates in\nthe \u03c3 < 100 kms\u22121 regime, suggests a steeper age slope than\nrecovered here, and a comparable metallicity trend. (Cald-\nwell et al. correct for the \u03b1-enhancement effect in deriving\nthe metallicities, but do not report [\u03b1\/Fe] measurements for\ntheir sample.) The recent study by Sa\u00b4nchez-Bla\u00b4zquez et al.\n(2006b), on the other hand, yields a very flat age\u2212\u03c3 relation\nin the Coma cluster (from \u223c20 galaxies), although a fairly\nsteep relation appears to hold in their Virgo and field\/group\ngalaxies. The discrepancy between y Sa\u00b4nchez-Bla\u00b4zquez et al.\nand the other results is striking, and remains to be under-\nstood. In particular, results from larger samples in Coma\n(e.g. Matkovic\u00b4 & Guzman 2005) should help to resolve this\nissue.\nOn balance, most of the recent line-strength-based stud-\nies concur on a significant age trend with \u03c3, such that while\nthe stars in the most massive galaxies are almost as old as\nthe universe, the low-\u03c3 galaxies on average continued to form\nstars into the z < 1 era. For example, taking Age\u221d \u03c30.5,\nand forcing the age at 300 km s\u22121 to be 12Gyr, our trend\nrequires an average age of \u223c7Gyr at \u03c3 = 100 km s\u22121, and\n\u223c5Gyr at \u03c3 = 50 kms\u22121. The corresponding redshift of the\nlast star-formation epoch is z \u2248 0.8 for \u03c3 = 100 kms\u22121, and\nz \u2248 0.5 for \u03c3 = 50km s\u22121. The implications of these results\nfor high-redshift observations have been discussed elsewhere\n(e.g. Smith 2005; Nelan et al. 2005), but can be updated\nhere. Specifically, some 50 per cent of the faint galaxies, now\nresiding on the red sequence \u223c2 magnitudes below L\u22c6, were\nstar-forming galaxies at z \u2248 0.5. The observed age\u2013mass re-\nlation therefore suggests that a deficit of faint red-sequence\ngalaxies should be observed in high redshift clusters. Early\nclaims for such a deficit (De Lucia et al. 2004; Kodama et\nal. 2004) have been supported by more extensive observa-\ntions (De Lucia et al. 2007; Muzzin et al. 2007; Stott et al.\n2007), although contrary results have been obtained (An-\ndreon 2006). De Lucia et al. define a giant-to-dwarf ratio,\nG\/D, on the red sequence of 20 clusters, based on number\nof red galaxies in luminosity intervals corrected for passive\nevolution. They report an increase of G\/D by a factor of \u223c3\nbetween z = 0 and z = 0.75. We have conducted some simple\nMonte-Carlo experiments using the red sequence luminosity\nfunction and the luminosity-\u03c3 correlation, to translate our\nage-\u03c3 relation into estimates for the evolution in G\/D. These\ntests yield G\/D increases by a factor of 2\u20135 at z = 0.75, for\nAge\u221d \u03c30.5, where the range includes different choices of lu-\nminosity function parameters, different normalisations of the\nage\u2013\u03c3 relation etc. We conclude that the ages measured in\npresent day red-sequence galaxies not only require a deficit\nof faint red galaxies in high redshift clusters as observed, but\nalso agree quantitatively in the level of of G\/D evolution out\nto z = 0.75.\nAs a closing caveat, we note that although the age\u2013\u03c3\nrelation has become a standard diagnostic for downsizing, it\nis usually applied to magnitude-limited samples. At a given\n\u03c3, galaxies which are younger than average for their mass\nwill be brighter than average, and so preferentially included\nin such samples, with the result of steepening the recovered\ntrends. The impact of the bias depends on the limiting lu-\nminosity reached by the sample, and is particularly severe\nfor surveys such as SDSS which cover only the exponential\ncut-off in the \u03c3 distribution.

We have described\nthe processing of spectra obtained from \u223c8 hr integrations\nwith AAOmega. As well as redshifts and velocity disper-\nsions, we have measured emission line equivalent widths and\nabsorption line indices. The latter incorporate an improved\ntreatment of corrections for instrumental resolution and ve-\nlocity broadening.\nWe find a 32 per cent incidence of H\u03b1 emission in the\nsupercluster sample. For red-sequence galaxies, emission is\ndetected in 20 per cent, with line ratios varying systemati-\ncally from AGN-like at high luminosity to being more consis-\ntent with normal star formation at low luminosity. Defining\na low-emission subsample based on the H\u03b1 measurements,\nwe have presented the index\u2212\u03c3 relations for a range of Lick\nline-strength indices. We show that the index\u2212\u03c3 relations\nand the physical scaling relations continue into the low-mass\nregime with little change in slope in most cases. Considering\nthe slopes of these relations, in the context of the Thomas\net al. (2003, 2004) stellar population models, we derived\nestimates for the scaling relations of age, total metallicity\nand \u03b1-element abundance ratio.

This analysis is presented in Paper II (Smith et\nal. 2007). Future papers will combine the AAOmega spectro-\nscopic data with imaging from the Shapley Optical Survey\n(Mercurio et al. 2006; Haines et al. 2006) to address stel-\nlar population variations as a function of morphology and\nenvironment.
