This is why the State, like any \nregulatory apparatus, follows, that which it \nregulates.  Its applications are always retrospective, \nsniffing out and running after feral belongings it \nmust attempt to recoup, to rechannel into State-\nfriendly patterns (Massumi, 2002: 83, emphasis in \noriginal).   \n \n \nIntroduction \n \nIt is well established that the gap between the global rich and the global poor has been \ngrowing.  For example, while the income gap between the fifth of the world\u2019s population \nliving in the richest countries and the fifth living in the poorest countries was 30 to 1 in \n1960, by 1997 it had grown to 74 to 1 (United Nations, 1999 \u2013 Human Development \nReport).  By the late 1990s, the richest 20 per cent of the world\u2019s population possessed 86 \nper cent of world GDP, while the poorest 20 per cent possessed a mere one per cent.  The \nincome of the most prosperous tenth of the world\u2019s households had more than eighty \ntimes the purchasing power of that of the poorest tenth (Therborn, 2001).  This gap is the \nproduct of the rich getting richer but also the poor getting poorer; a trend affecting the \ndeveloped countries, but especially acute in the developing world, with large sections of \nthe population in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, East and South Asia and the post-\ncommunist states thrown back daily into abject poverty.  As John Lloyd (2001: 21) notes, \n\u2018half of the global population \u2013 roughly 3 billion people \u2013 live in abject poverty; nearly \nhalf of these \u2013 1.2. billion in 2000 \u2013 live in utter destitution, on less than $1 dollar a day, \nin danger of death by starvation or a related disease.  Access to safe drinking water is \nunknown to 1 billion people; 2.4 billion have no adequate sanitation\u2019.  The result is a \nshameful catalogue of woe marked by escalating early mortality, child labour, \nprostitution, disease and malnutrition, displacement and forced migration, the violences \nof social breakdown, state social control and factional war, acute risk and uncertainty, \nenvironmental degradation and vulnerability, and loss of existential and material security.   \n \n 1\nThere is a live debate on whether this increase in global inequality and vulnerability can \nbe linked to contemporary patterns of globalization, with opinion sharply divided along \nideological and interpretative lines.  Neo-liberal opinion \u2013 among the Washington \nConsensus institutions and business lobbies, for example - remains convinced that the \nnegative outcomes are the product of insufficient market freedom, that is, incomplete \nmarket-driven globalization.  It calls for total freedom of factor markets, free trade and \nmarket extension, supply side reforms to boost competitiveness and entrepreneurship, \ncurbs on the redistributive state, and controls on inflation, interest rates and state \nexpenditure.  Critics, in contrast, who range from social democrats for or against \nglobalization to anti-globalization protestors, lay much of the blame on neo-liberal \npolicies or unbridled global capitalism for the increase in inequality and vulnerability.  \nThe first group, led by governments in the global south (and belatedly the World Bank \nand certain G7 countries), while more or less neutral about the benefits of free trade and \ninternational investment, argues that excessive and rapid financial liberalization coupled \nto punitive structural adjustment policies enforced on governments, have fuelled \nunemployment, investment blight, poverty and indebtedness in the developing world \n(Stiglitz, 2002).  The second group, by no means unified, claims that the rising inequality \nis the product of the bias of international agreements towards the interests of Western \ncountries and corporations, the exploitative practices of transnational organizations, the \nbias of free markets towards the fittest and most powerful, the loss of autonomy resulting \nfrom international integration, and the erosion of the economy of subsistence, well-being \nand needs by the market economy (Bray and Bray, 2002; Bello, 2002).   \n \nThese contrasting claims come with partial and anecdotal evidence, but a noticeable \ndevelopment in the last four to five years has been the growth of studies seeking to \nempirically measure the link between inequality and globalization on a more \ncomprehensive basis.  Their results are much more circumspect.  For example, in a recent \nattempt to measure the relative weight of historical change, national processes and \ncontemporary internationalization trends, G\u00f6ran Therborn concludes that \u2018global history \nand current national processes are the most potent producer of the current global \noutcomes of inequality\u2019 (2001: 472, original emphasis)1.  Therborn also shows that the \noutcomes of contemporary internationalization have been highly differentiated:  while \nthere appears to be no significant correlation between the size of international trade and \ndomestic inequality, the liberalization of short term capital movements has had a major \nnegative impact on the South, but in turn, the global flow of medical knowledge has \n\u2018played an outstanding, if not a solo performance, in bringing about the most important \nprocess of equalization of the world\u2019 (p. 466).   \n \nSimilarly, Arthur Alderson and Fran\u00e7ois Nielsen (2002) have undertaken a detailed \nanalysis of the impact of globalization \u2013 measured in terms of outward FDI, imports from \nthe South and in-migration \u2013 on income inequality in a number of OECD countries since \nthe 1970s.  Their empirical findings show that all three dimensions of globalization \n                                                 \n1 This is not to necessarily diminish the role of globalization, since it could be argued that national \nprocesses are increasingly defined by the latter (e.g. the orders of international organizations), but \nconclusions of this kind do provide a salutary check on excessive demonizations of globalization, however \ndefined. \n 2\nappear to have played a part, by inter alia, accelerating deindustrialization, weakening \nthe bargaining power of labour, reducing the returns to unskilled labour, increasing skills \nheterogeneity within the labour force, and intensifying competition within the labour \nmarket.  Interestingly, however, they also show that the rise in inequality can be \nassociated with other factors tenuously linked to globalization.  These include labour \nforce shift out of agriculture at a time of constrained growth in industry, demographic \nexpansion, de-unionization, the decline of wage-setting coordination, and the growth of \nfemale labour force participation.  Indeed, in ranking the factors, the authors conclude \nthat outward FDI and imports from the South have been less significant in increasing \ninequality than agricultural shift, labour market deregulation and the strength of social \ndemocratic welfare protections within each country.   \n \nThese two examples alone show that establishing a link between globalization and \ninequality is fraught with difficulty, not only because of how globalization is defined and \nhow inequality is measured, but also because the entanglements between globalization \nforces and \u2018domestic\u2019 trends are not that easy to separate out (e.g. do the local economic \neffects of home based TNCs or the effects of the Washington Consensus within the US \ncount as outcomes of globalization or internal changes?).  However, there is sufficient \nevidence to conclude that contemporary processes of globalization have been \naccompanied by a rise in global inequality and vulnerability. \n \nThe urgency, therefore, to regulate globalization in ways that will reduce poverty and \ninequality cannot be underestimated.  But the key question is whether this can be done \nthrough existing institutional and spatial arrangements.  According to one reading of \ncontemporary economic globalization, the processes of time-space compression, global \nconnectivity and world-scape formation involved are defining a new, topologically and \nheterarchically structured economic space that is quite different from the hitherto \ndominant world system based on territorially organized and state-regulated economies \n(Urry 2003; Amin, 2002; Shepherd, 2002).  Contemporary developments such as trade \nand financial liberalization, global corporate and technological organization, and rapid \nflows of money, information, expertise and people are considered to amount to more than \na simple turn in the longue dur\u00e9e of the world system, more than the machinations of the \ntransnational capitalist class or Washington coalition, more than a (neo-liberal) blip that \ncan be reversed with the help of the state-centered tools of yesteryear, and more than a \nproblem of multi-level governance.  The reading, thus, comes with a strong sense of \nradical change and of no return in the conduct and regulation of the global economy, and \na considerable degree of agnosticism about the nature and possibility of a new regulatory \nsettlement. \n \nIn contrast, as already hinted, there is another set of readings of economic globalization \nwhich seem much more certain of the ways of the new world order, possibly because \ntheir focus falls less on change in the everyday map of economic organization than on the \nrules that hold the system together.  Spurred by the neo-liberal onslaught, they come with \nan assuredness about how globalization should be managed.  Pursue the minimal state, \nderegulation, liberalization, privatization, free enterprise, market society and market \nmorality and you will have freedom, prosperity and fulfillment, say the apologists \n 3\narguing for more market.  Pursue all of this and you have heightened global risk, \ninequality and misery, say its critics arguing for a new social democratic consensus or for \na post-capitalist order.  Common across the differences is the assumption that the global \neconomy can be harnessed, tamed, controlled \u2013 either from above or below \u2013 around a \nglobal regulatory meta-narrative.   \n \nThis paper brings together these two readings of economic globalization, in an attempt to \ninterpret both as theses on \u2018regulation\u2019.  This is an uncommon move, because by and \nlarge the processes dealt with by the first reading have not been interpreted as realms of \nregulation in their own right.  As a consequence, the discussion on global regulation, \nanimated by the second reading, has tended to proceed in terms of thinking of regulation \nas a separate institutional filed that acts upon another entity called the economy.  My aim \nis to show that if placed on the same analytical plane, the readings offer markedly \ndifferent interpretations of regulatory processes and possibilities, with the former \nstressing the heterarchical and topological nature of ordering in the contemporary \nglobalizing economy, and the latter tending to stress its hierarchical and scalar nature and \nso also possibilities of Olympian control.  Each comes with different normative \nimplications, which is why it is worth comparing them.   \n \nSome observers might be tempted to argue that the two are not comparable and claim that \nwhile the Olympian reading deals with affairs of macroeconomic management, the latter \nis concerned with processes of micro-regulation.  I disagree.  The micro\/macro distinction \nbecomes artificial, once the economy is seen as an assemblage of circuits of provision \nthat fold actants with regulatory power at different levels into one field of action (from \nnational employment law and monetary policies and international environmental \nregulations and trade agreements, to labour market rules, technology arrangements, and \nvarious firm-centered governance conventions).  If we accept that micro regulation and \nmacro regulation are co-constituted, perhaps even points along the same continuum, then \nthe juxtaposition of the Olympian and heterarchical readings has much to reveal about the \nnature and potential of order in the globalized economy.  For example, a common refrain \nof the Olympian reading, as we shall in the first half of the paper, is that global neo-\nliberalism is generating a regulatory deficit, which, if filled with pro-developmental and \npro-poor policies, can provide a stable macroeconomic framework for closing the growth \nversus equity gap within and between the nations.  In contrast, it could be deduced from \nthe heterarchical reading, as we shall see in the second half, that contemporary economic \nglobalization is resulting in an excess of regulation, in a multiplicity of orderings of a \ntrans-scalar and relational nature that contradict Olympian readings which continue to \nmake strong territorial or scalar assumptions about the nature of economic organization \nand economic returns.  The normative implications of these different opinions on \nregulatory possibilities will be taken up in the conclusion. \n \nMeta-Narratives of Global Order \n \nThe growing concern over the spatial and social inequalities associated with market \nfundamentalism, the Washington Consensus and the unchecked activities of the \ntransnational business elite, has stimulated wide ranging debate on the nature of world \n 4\nreforms necessary to tackle these inequalities.  A range of new meta-narratives of \nregulation, of possible order are emerging as alternatives to neo-liberal regulation.   \n \nGlobalization with a Human Face  \n \nOne discernible meta-narrative of global regulation is what Takis Fotpoulos (2001) has \ncalled globalization with a human face.  It accepts the logic of market capitalism, \nespecially free trade, but not the excesses of neo-liberal regulation or abuses of state \nregulation.  It is, in many ways, the global equivalent of Third Way experiments in social \nliberalism and a new ethic of social responsibility pioneered by Clinton and Blair.  A key \nargument is that the globalized economy requires effective global regulation, which \nhitherto has been piecemeal and captured by specialist interests as well as unchecked by a \npredominantly national or inter-governmental system of regulation.   \n \nA range of reforms are proposed, or implementation at global level and within the South, \nto tackle poverty and inequality.  For example, Amartya Sen (    ) and others critical of \nthe crushing weight of state planning, bureaucratic deficiency and corporatism in the \ndeveloping world or the once socialist states have argued for a dual approach centered \naround, on the one hand, building capabilities and grass-roots democracy to unlock local \npotential and competitiveness, and, on the other hand, empowerment of global NGOs and \nNGO networks in order to provide a counterweight to G7 and corporate-dominated \ninternational regulation.  David Held (2002) has gone further to argue for a new \ncosmopolitan order that legislates for \u2018people\u2019s equal moral worth, their active agency \nand what is required for their autonomy and development\u2019 (p. 67), through a legally \nbinding and enforceable international code of conduct.  Such a code should reframe \u2018the \nground rules or basic laws of the free-market and trade system\u2019 (p. 72) by tying them \nclosely to cosmopolitan principles to ensure the \u2018firm enactment of existing human rights \nand environmental agreements and the clear articulation of these with the ethical codes of \nparticular industries\u2019 (p. 72).  Similarly, Richard Falk (2003) has argued that such \nreforms, harnessed to other universal principles of democracy such as consent of the \ncitizenry, rule of law, human rights, participation and accountability will ensure that \nglobalization can work as a force for good. \n \nThis appeal to a cosmopolitan democracy extended to corporate practices can be tied to a \ngrowing momentum of interest in a \u2018responsible global capitalism\u2019 (Dunning, 2003) or \nnew market morality based on social inclusion.  Tackling global inequality is seen to be \nless a matter of interfering with unfolding processes of globalization, than that of \nchanging the terms on which wealth is generated and appropriated in the market \neconomy.  John Dunning (2003), for example, argues that an opening has arisen from the \nrise of an alliance-based capitalism that relies centrally on creativity and cooperation for \ncompetitive advantage, one which \u2018demands a reordering and reprioritization of moral \nvalues, and an attitude of mind\u2019 (p. 24) towards a universal ethos of compassion2.    A \n                                                 \n2 He includes in this ethos enlightened self interest, a global ethic based on humanity, reciprocity, respect \nfor life, non-violence, truthfulness, justice and partnership, and the codes of moral conduct enshrined in \ndifferent religious and belief systems. \n 5\nnew market morality is seen to be a vital element in securing socially responsible \neconomic behaviour. \n \nOther regulatory elements of \u2018global capitalism with a human face\u2019 are less reliant on \nmoral arguments.  For example, the disastrous record of Washington-driven policies of \nstructural adjustment over the last two decades has fuelled a reform movement \u2013 \nincreasingly supported by the World Bank and social democratic governments \u2013 calling \nfor the explicit reorientation of global institutions and inter-governmental agreements \noriented towards pro-poor and pro-developmental policies.  Joe Stiglitz (2003: 88), for \nexample, argues for a new post-Washington Consensus paradigm that: \n \n\u2026 takes as its core objective development, the transformation of society.  \nIt recognizes that an integral part of successful development is the increase \nin GDP per capita.  But this is only part of the story, and even this will not \nbe achieved unless the country adopts a broader and more socially \noriented development focus.  If successful, the new development strategy \nwill not only raise GDP per capita, but also living standards, as evidenced \nby standards of health and literacy and a reduction of such bads as crime \nand drugs.  It will reduce poverty \u2013 our goal should be its elimination \u2026..  \nIt will be sustainable, strengthening the environment.  And the real \nsocietal transformations will enhance the likelihood that the underlying \npolicies will be durable, withstanding the vicissitudes sometimes \naccompanying democratic processes.   \n \nThere is no shortage of proposals for the international policy community, gathered \naround a kind of reworked global Keynesianism.  One proposal is for the WTO to have \ngreater representation from the South and for its conversion into a development \ninstitution, so that inter alia, free trade can work for the South by eliminating restrictive \npractices and protectionism in the North and by relaxing intellectual property rights rules \nthat prevent science an technology development in the South (Stiglitz, 2003; Deardorff \nand Stern, 2002; Helleiner, 2001).  Another proposal is to reorient the international \nfinancial regime \u2013 private and public - towards developmental goals, by restricting short \nterm capital flight, facilitating the access of low income countries to medium term capital \nvia better access to bond markets or conversion of the IMF into a development fund, \nreducing the debt burden of countries, and ensuring that aid supports human well-being \n(Stiglitz, 2002; White, 2001).  A third proposal is to ensure that developing countries \nreceive better tax income from international investors, to name and shame exploitative \nand unethical investors (White, 2001, supported by stricter enforcement of international \nlabour, environmental and fair trade standards.   \n \nThe new social democratic narrative, in its various strands, assumes that a new global \nregulatory regime will be able to tackle the abuses of an unregulated capitalism without \nthe need to alter its fundamentals.  As Gordon Brown (2003), UK Chancellor of the \nExchequer argues, globalization can be made good through effective regulation at the \nworld scale and binding commitment to people-oriented growth.  While the proposals \ncome with a long overdue clarity as a coherent alternative to neo-liberalism, their \n 6\nprospect on the ground seems less secure.  They promise both too much and too little.  \nFirst, the recommendations come with a surprising lack of attentiveness to issues of \nagency and power play.  Contemporary international regulation is geared towards state \nand corporate interests (see next sub-section) that actually benefit from the world as it is \nand its Washington Consensus institutions are far from likely to cave in.  In turn, it is far \nfrom clear who is to lead the charge in making sure that cosmopolitan democracy, an \nethic of responsibility, and a developmental and pro-poor regulatory regime is put into \nplace at world level.  Indeed many states in the North and elites in the South will \nvehemently oppose the reforms for the threat they pose to vested interests.   \n \nSecond, in order to be effective, the new international regime will have to work as an \nintegrated regulatory system, but it is far from the literature how, and by whom, the \nactions of the various institutions \u2013 the WTO, IMF, World Bank and other financial \ninstitutions NGOs, aid organizations, influential fora such as the World Economic Forum, \nguardians of cosmopolitan democracy \u2013 are to be mutually reinforced and policed.  In \nfact, as I shall argue in the second half of this paper, there is far too much variety and \nregulatory agency in emerging world economic networks for such coordinated \ngovernance to work effectively.  \n \nThird, some key actants on inequality and poverty are left out of the regulatory frame in \nthis particular meta-narrative.  One of the arguments of the anti-globalization movement \nis that deregulation and market liberalism in general have contributed to risk and \nvulnerability in the South by increasing cash and market dependency, destabilizing the \nsubsistence economy, and destroying traditional and small-scale activities, thus \nundermining making any solution that fails to regulate market dynamics (Kirby, 2002; \nSeabrook, 2002).  Another argument is that TNCs and other powerful players such as \ninternational banks are deeply embedded in the production of inequality, through their \ninfluence over governments, their tax evasion schemes, their poor environmental record, \ntheir labour market practices, their locational mobility, their market power, their dumping \npractices.  It is na\u00efve to assume that moves towards corporate social responsibility in a \nframe of putative cooperation within a putative alliance capitalism, will reverse these \nbads.  Few in the South will be taken in by the argument that the \u2018multiple checks and \nbalances imposed by a globally integrated economy, in which multinational corporations \nand non-government organizations play and important policing role, combined with the \nspread of global communications, means that all societies will be more open, less cut off \nand less prey to authoritarian leaders with messianic visions of the future and the past \n(Leadbeater, 2002: 331). \n \nHuman Face without Globalization \n \nA second distinctive meta-narrative of regulation that is emerging is one arguing for a \nreversal of globalization and the re-centering of the global economy around national or \ninter-state systems of control.  It sees globalization as a politically driven project, driven \nby the Washington Consensus institutions (the US government, the IMF, World Bank, \nWTO, G7, major corporations and various free market lobbyists and apologists) and \nlegitimated by states that stand to gain as well as those told to think there is no alternative \n 7\nto neo-liberalism.  Pierre Bourdieu (2002: 31), for example, argues that so powerful has \nbeen the grip of the discourse of globalization based on combining the \u2018lexicon of liberty, \nliberalism, and deregulation\u2019 that these states have actually consented to \u2018divest \nthemselves of the power to control economic forces\u2019 and to actively encourage \nglobalization (Conley, 2002).  States, it is said, have done this partly in the hope of some \neconomic returns, but also due to the influence of the transnational capitalist elite \n(composed of TNC executives and their local affiliates, the globalizing bureaucrats and \npoliticians based in major international organizations, the mobile professions based in \nfoundations, think tanks, the mass media, and business-led networks such as the \nEuropean Roundtable of Industrialists or the WEF at Davos) that has taken the \u2018necessary \nsteps to institutionalize its transnational role\u2019 (Fotopoulos, 2001: 255) and succeeded in \nconvincing that its agenda is the only option for world capitalism.   \n \nAccording to this meta-narrative, which holds in a human face without globalization, a \nnew regulatory settlement is possible if the conceit of transnational liberalism can be \nexposed and resisted to demonstrate that much of economic life can be regulated through \nfairly orthodox means around national settlements, democratically contested inter-\ngovernmental agreements, and renewed civic participation.  Bourdieu, for example, \nargues that the \u2018repoliticization of policy\u2019 (2001) should include vigorous defense of the \nsocial state, coordinated action by governments and larger political units such as the EU \nto tax and tame capital, better coordination between disparate social movements, and a \nrenewed trade unionism at European scale, so that an effective momentum for another \nmodel of economic organization and reward is built.  Others such as Leo Panitch (2000) \nargue that pressure from below \u2013 across the full range of social forces \u2013 should force \nliberal governments to press for global change in the priorities of inter-state meetings and \ninternational organization such as the WTO and IMF.  Similarly, Leslie Sklair (2000) \nsuggests that the attempts of the transnational capitalist class to build global presence \nthrough high profile meetings such as Davos or influence over the media and business \ncurricula, should be exposed as purely interest-ridden.   \n \nIn this new model of international regulation \u2013 to be actively pushed by national and \ninternational social movements \u2013 the role of the state is considered pivotal.  For example, \nHirst and Thompson (2002), envisage the possibility of global re-regulation through the \nchannels of intergovernmental cooperation, through pressure brought on the US to work \nin a multilateral framework, and through reforms to the workings of existing international \ninstitutions (along the lines spelt out above).  For them, it is far too premature to speak of \nthe need for regulation at the global level, owing to the \u2018continued relevance of classic \ninternational relations\u2019 (Hirst and Thompson, 2002: 254) negotiated through an inter-state \nsystem of diplomacy and threat, as states continuing to \u2018seek to protect their populations \nan to monopolize and control the distribution of key resources\u2019 (ibid: 254).  The US, of \ncourse, is a prime example of this, acting according to Michael Mann (2001\/2) as a \ntemplate state behaviour in international affairs.  Those who concede that the historic \npower of the state is being restricted by the rise of governance beyond the state, still \nmaintain, as does Armand Mattelart (2002: 609), that \u2018like it or not, the territory of the \nnation-state remains the place where the social contract is defined.  It has by no means \nreached the degree of obsolescence suggested by the crusade in favour of \n 8\ndeterritorialization through networks\u2019.  State based re-regulation plus democratically \nnegotiated inter-governmentalism, it is believed, can tackle the global inequalities \nexacerbated by neo-liberalism.   \n \nThis thesis rests centrally on the argument that the world economy remains highly \nterritorialized, based around demarcated trading blocs, national and sub-national sources \nof competitiveness and innovation, increasing returns on a national basis, and national \npatterns of economic exclusion and inequality.  Indeed, the thesis generally is skeptical of \nthe idea of a world economy composed of transnational flow, ubiquity and instantaneity, \ndistanciated effects and global organization and regulation.  Much of the debate on \neconomic globalization over the last decade has been dominated by the confrontation of \nthese two positions, with neither camp giving much ground.  I do not intend to repeat the \ndebate here, but simply to summarize the account of globalization on which this thesis \nbases its position on regulation.  Paul Hirst and Grahame Thompson (1999; 2002) have \nbeen at the vanguard of denying economic globalization, arguing that the world economy \ncontinues to best described as an inter-state entity.  They have argued that foreign direct \ninvestment continues to be dominated by flows to and from a restricted number of \ncountries, that its decennial increase has started to peak, that transnational corporations \ncontinue to work from the home base and sell in circumscribed trading blocs, that world \ntrade too is divided into three major trading blocs dominated by nation-states, that \neconomic transactions fall away dramatically with distance, and that while international \ntrade may be expanding, so to is domestic trade.  Indeed, most recently (2002), they have \ngone so far as to argue that like past cycles of globalization, the present one may have \nreached its limits, notably in terms of the slow down in the growth of international trade.  \nThe upshot is that \u2018nation-states are not being overwhelmed and that the future of \nextended multilateral governance does not look promising \u2013 in a turbulent physical and \ninternational environment the nation-state may become more salient as a means of \nprotection against global forces beyond supranational governance \u2026\u2019 (p. 263).   \n \nThis controversial thesis has been roundly criticized for defining economic globalization \nrather to narrowly, for ignoring the qualitative aspects of economic transnationalism as \nwell as the grip of TNCs on international trade and market power, for disregarding the \narray of visible and invisible forces (e.g. brands, consumption habits, media and \ncommercial processes, technological and financial developments, rhetoric) that make up \nand sustain global networks, for not tracing the distant or virtual events in a highly \nconnected world that routinely affect processes and outcomes in the least expected places \n(e.g. the role of speculation in world financial markets in the East Asian crisis), and for \nfailing to grasp how new globalised networks are disrupting economies organized as \ncontainer spaces.  This failure to grasp the changing spatial ontology of economic \norganization, which is resulting in an intensifying clash between territorial systems (the \nworld as a string of national economies) and network\/flow arrangements (the world as a \ncontinuum of networks of varying length and duration) is perhaps the key weakness of \nthis nation-centered interpretation of globalization.  It plays down the significance of \nregulatory arrangements that come with the new global flows and networks (as shown in \nthe next section) and because of this it underestimates how real has been the relativization \n 9\nof power and influence across the globe, both spatially and institutionally (Jessop, 1999; \nPeck and Tickell, 2002).   \n \nThe case for reversing globalization remains unconvincing because of all that is left out \nin the making of the contemporary world.  The nation-centered Left is right to remind us \nof the enduring role of the state\/inter-governmentalism, but it is wrong in assuming that \nthis remains the only or most significant channel of regulation and political change.  The \nrise of the anti-globalization movement, the rise and effectiveness of the transnational \nelite, and the power that international organizations are acquiring in their own right is \ntestimony to this radical relativisation of state-centered regulation.  So too is the rise of \nnew forms of global organization that are set to multiply and sidestep, complicate and \nchallenge embedded statism and its underlying assumptions of meta-order. \n \nHeterarchies of Order \n \nThere is growing recognition that one of the distinctive achievements of contemporary \nglobalization is the routinization of a new spatial ontology based on network forms and \nflows of varied geographical composition, reach and duration (Dicken et al, 2001; Amin, \n2002; Massey, 2004; Larner and Le Heron, 2002; Urry, 2003; Sheppard,  ).  It is a \nradically transformative ontology covering all areas of social life.  It includes the spatial \nradiations of telecommunications and transport networks around the world, which in \nmany places, can isolate proximate neighbours (Graham, 2002).  It includes cultural \ndomains that cut across lines of longitude and latitude in complex spatial arrangements \n(Nederveen Pieterse, 2003).  It consists of a mass of supply chains and corporate \nnetworks that tie producers, intermediaries and consumers in the most unexpected places \nin highly structured and close patterns of mutuality and dependence (Dicken, 2003; \nHughes and Reimer, 2004).  It includes well-trodden but not always visible tracks of \ntransnational migration, tourism, business travel, asylum, and organized terror, which \ndissect through, and lock, established communities into new circuits of belonging and \nattachment, resentment and fear (Castles and Miller, 1998; Gray, 2003).  It includes \ntranshuman networks of sacred, viroid, digital, animal and plant life that summon \nmeaning and attachment at microcosmic, bodily, aerial, epidemiological, planetary and \ncosmological scales, and which thoroughly infuse life at any given site (Whatmore, \n2002).  It includes spaces of emotional attachment whose geographies are almost as \nvaried as life on earth, ranging from the workings of home, family and the playground, to \nthe long cultural networks that feed the screen and the musical arrangements etched on \nCDs.  It involves political registers that now far exceed the traditional sites of \ncommunity, town hall, parliament, state and nation, spilling over into the machinery of \nvirtual public spheres, international organizations, global social movements, diaspora \npolitics, and planetary or cosmopolitan projects (Hardt and Negri, 2000; Connolly, 2002).   \n \nThe sum of these developments is a new spatial ontology that thoroughly disrupts the \ndominant spatial ontology of territorial units of organization and scalar regulation that we \nhave become used to.  As I have implied above, it does not amount to a mapping of \nglobal level processes, flows and domains upon older arrangements at other spatial \nscales.  Instead, it should be read as a force field affecting and rearranging all spatial \n 10\nrelations and orderings; radically altering the meaning of core boundary distinctions \ncategories such as inside and outside, home and world, near and afar, intimate and \nstrange.  For example, new communities of belonging are now formed in cyberspace and \nacross vast physical distances with the help of various immutable mobiles, thereby \naltering the distinction between relational and territorial meanings of space\/place or \nhome\/world.  In turn, the geographically local is now distanced from the physically \nproximate as sites are pulled into dispersed networks of firms, kinship or imagined \ncommunities.  Conversely, on-going territorial relations \u2013 in local economic clusters, \nregional identities or national imaginaries \u2013 are now so shot through with trans-territorial \npresences and absences \u2013 from the flows of people and information and goods and \nimages to the effects of interest rate and political decisions elsewhere - that they cannot \nbe grasped as social formations without recognition of their multiple constitutive \ngeographies.   \n \nThere is no descriptor that properly captures this new spatial ontology.  John Urry \nsuggests the term \u2018fractal space\u2019, to highlight the spatial blurring resulting from the \nsymbiosis of bodies, computers, groups, communications networks, societies and \ncybernetic systems.   He explains, \u2018global relations thus involve new fractal social spaces, \nas each realm folds over, under, through and beyond each other in striking new social \ntopologies.  These are \u2018firelike\u2019, oscillatory, flickering, both here and there, both inside \nand outside rather like a Mobius strip\u2019 (Urry, 2003: 74).  Globalization seen as a force \nfield along these lines has considerable implications in terms of how we conceptualize \nthe spaces and conduct of the economy and what we decide counts as economic life.   \n \nFirst, these fractal spaces are at once spaces of network relations (Dicken et. al., 2001) \nand fields exercising a \u2018powerful gravity effect upon numerous, diverse localized \npatterns\u2019 (Urry, 2003: 94).  They have an architecture of their own, in the way that global \nsupply chains or networks of transnational corporations or virtual circuits of global \nfinancial traders might have, but they also act as a force pulling in situated arrangements \ninto a wider constitutive field, in the way that, say, environmental disasters in one part of \nthe world might destroy the print industry in another part of the world by raising the price \nof wood, or how trends towards unitary global business and accounting norms might \ndrive decision-making and economic appraisal in different locations.  Events in this dual \nspatial structure \u2013 network space and gravitational space \u2013 continually jostle to generate \nunpredictable emergent forms.  It is emergence of this nature \u2013 the production of novelty \nthrough relational interaction between the elements of a system \u2013 that requires a reading \nof globalization as the continual making of a new world order with novel spatial \narrangements and rules (which is why interpretations of globalization as the spread or \nsynthesis of known spatial ontologies are so hopelessly wrong).  The spatial structure of \nthese emergent forms is, by definition, hard to predict.  It may include, as Urry argues, a \nnew everyday planetary consciousness fed by the many world signifiers that are \nconstantly paraded these days, including satellite images of a small world, global brand \nnames and companies, world music, CNN, American Express.  It may include new site \npractices as centre points for global interaction, such as sitting all day in front of a \nterminal, where the combination of operator dexterity and expertise, chat with colleagues, \nsophisticated software, and ability to manipulate live information, allow meaningful and \n 11\neffective business with the rest of the world (Knorr Cetina and Bruegger, 2002; Beunza \nand Stark, 2002).  It may include mobility patterns \u2013 physical and virtual - across time \nand space zones, that gradually lay down tramlines that come to work as standards \nagainst which business success is measured.  It may include new spatial topologies that \nare still only liminal in form or yet to be made.  What is significant, however, is that these \nemergent forms have considerable force as the orderings of contemporary globalization.   \n \nSecondly, as a consequence, it is essential to grasp globalization as a performative act, as \nis increasingly recognized in sociological and geographical work.  In part, this \nperformativity is about scripting new global economic protocols for all to follow and be \nmeasured by. The meta-narratives discussed earlier can be read in this way, as can the \nwork of all manner of cultural technologies to engineer ecumenical status for virtues that \nare supposed to drive the new knowledge economy or alliance capitalism.  These include \nnew business management credos advocating connectivity, theatricality, youthfulness, \nspeed, branding, imaging, imagination and creativity (Thrift, 2002), the constant \noutpouring of new names, concepts and icons such as CyberCity, Infotainment, cool \nhunter, e-trader, dream weaver, chaos pilot and cool hunter to mark the future (L\u00f6fgren, \n2003), and the generation of a series of \u2018catwalk\u2019 technologies such as global benchmarks \nto calculate the international competitiveness of products and processes in different parts \nof the world (Larner and Le Heron, 2002), or orchestrations of events to show off \npresence and worth (L\u00f6fgren, 2003).  A whole army of actors3 are drafted into \nperforming the new global economic ecumene, in judging who and what counts in the \nnew knowledge economy.   \n \nThe performance of globalization is also about the constant renegotiation of what counts \nas the economic.  This is not to claim an elevated status, for example, for \u2018cultural \neconomy\u2019 in the present global circumstances, since the economy across the ages has \nbeen the artifact of moral assumptions, aesthetic impulses, passion play, knowledge \nwork, and cultures of discipline and regulation (Amin and Thrift, 2004).  I do not wish to \nargue that the economy has become more culturally inflected under conditions of \nglobalization.  Instead, the argument is about treating contemporary globalization as a \nnew kind of cultural economy performance with new mappings.  So, for example, Spike \nPeterson (2002) argues that an attentiveness to reproductive, productive, and virtual \ndomains of the economy allows us to see contemporary economic globalization as a \nprocess that \u2018brings the identities, ideologies, and practices of \u2018social reproduction\u2019, \nwelfare provisioning, non-wage labor and informalization into relation with the familiar \nbut currently restructured \u2018productive economy\u2019 of commodity exchange, as well as with \nthe less familiar but increasingly consequential \u2013 though dematerialized \u2013 \u2018virtual \neconomy\u2019 of financial markets, cyberspace, and the exchange less of goods than of signs\u2019 \n(p. 5).  There are long chains \u2013 spatial and compositional \u2013 of material that enter into any \ngiven economic network which need recognition.  For example, the prolific discussion on \nthe implications of transnational corporations in world development would benefit from \nattending to the effects of domestic gender relations, informal work and the remittance \n                                                 \n3 These include magazines, newspapers, quality auditors, business consultants, IT and media specialists and \nspecialist outlets, advertising agencies, event organizers, management gurus, performance indicators, \nmeasurement tools, and so on, \n 12\neconomy, the effects of employee investment of savings in world stock markets, or the \neffects of material and symbolic cultures of production and consumption.  It would both \nreveal the breadth of what we choose to define as \u2018economic\u2019 globalization and also \npuncture the generalizations of good or bad that abound in this field of study, by \nrevealing the heterogeneous and often unexpected performances of the varied objects-in-\nrelation.  It would tell both the story of low wages, poor working conditions, \ndisplacement and (s)exploitation in TNC-dominated export processing zones in the \nGlobal south, and the story of self-help projects to supplement income, acquisition of \nnew competences and confidences, pooling of wages to establish women\u2019s centres and \nother local welfare-oriented projects, and a re-balancing of gender power in the home \n(Bergerson, 2001).   \n \nFinally, thinking about globalization as a performance helps to reveal that the new \nformations need to be worked at, maintained, aligned, made to count.  They have no pre-\ngiven structural power (Dicken et al, 2001), which is why a reading of globalization as \nthe unfolding of an immanent capitalist logic or the inscribed power of old suspects is in \nitself suspect.  If a power dynamic emerges, separating out clear winners and losers and \nclear lines of command and obeisance, rather like a tramline, it is the inscription of \nrecursive relations, it is the mobilization of all kinds of material - warnings, predations, \nterritorial markings, minions, allies and rumours - to ensure that returns flow in one \ndirection, and it is the naturalization of rules, markings and commentaries that come to be \nnever questioned.  Entire network architectures \u2013 their flow lines, nodes, spaces, contours \n\u2013 and all their actants \u2013 key players, codes, rules, technologies, symbols, calculative \npractices, employees, buildings, terminals - are made to work to hold the shape of the \nfield of action and to channel rewards and exercise influence in certain directions.  This is \nwhy, to return to the example of transnational corporations, the study of the role of these \ncorporations in world development must examine the effects of business management \ncanons, metrics of measurement and evaluation, software rules, supply-chain \nconventions, business travel patterns, knowledge generation cultures, and rituals of \nalignment and belonging.  These \u2018small\u2019 things are central in influencing who and what \ngets rules in and ruled out or rewarded, and yet they rarely feature in assessments of the \nrelationship between globalization and poverty and inequality. \n \nMicro-worlds of Regulation \n \nAll of the above three examples of global performativity can be read as tales of \nordering\/regulation.  All three are fields of action that rely on an assemblage of objects-\nin-relation to define the field, set the rules of play, order the play, hold things together.  \nWe saw from the discussions on global ecumene and cultural economy, that culture, \ntechnology, passion, cognition, aesthetic evaluation and acting up are not only part of the \nfabric of economic conduct, but also centrally involved in setting the rules of conduct.  \nSimilarly, we saw from the illustration of corporate networks that the process of global \nnetwork formation is itself of ordering and regulation hidden in the inscriptions of small \nthings and embodied conventions.  In turn, all three examples are mappings of regulation \nthat transect geographies of regulation based on territorial jurisdiction and scalar reach.  \nThey all point to another logic of regulation \u2013 heterarchical, topological, and micro-\n 13\nperformative - that does not correspond with meta-orders of regulation, with their \nemphasis on territory, state and nested hierarchy.  These \u2018micro-performances\u2019 of \nregulation, importantly, are neither minor in significance nor small in reach.  On the \ncontrary, they are globally significant in terms of both power (e.g. via new global \necumenical norms) and spatial reach (e.g. via s of order in networks of a transnational \nnature).  The three examples below illustrate the regulatory dynamics at work across new \nglobal economic landscapes, including their relationship with meta-orders discussed in \nthe first half of the paper. \n \nFirst, to return to the role of transnational corporations in world development, debate \nover the last thirty years has focused on the nature of rules that states and international \norganizations should introduce to maximize local returns.  In the course of time, the \ndiscourse on regulation has changed to reflect the evolution of the firms from home-\nbased organizations with a hierarchy of operations around the world towards global \norganizations commanding long supply chains, networks and consumption norms across \nthe world.  Thus, early calls for nation-centered policies on transfer pricing, local \nsourcing, and jobs and working conditions, gave way to calls for international agreements \nto prevent capital flight and investment switching between regions, coupled to a raft of \nglobal protocols on corporate social responsibility, dumping and market manipulation, \nand branding and advertising.  There is no doubt that related regulations served to \ninfluence corporate strategy and behaviour and shape local outcomes.  My aim is not to \nargue that the corporations have escaped regulation thus defined.  Instead, it is to claim \nthat the economic and social worlds held together by the transnational corporations have \nbecome regimes of order in their own right.  For example, conduct in the vast supply \nchains that feed the corporations \u2013 from the duration of local contracts to the quality of \nlocal employment - are directly influenced by the pricing policies and credit \narrangements of the corporations, by the purchasing practices of major subcontractors, by \nthe mode of audit and risk assessment used and by the methods of a new breed of third \nparty consultants that has grown in recent years to manage supply chains on behalf of \nmajor corporations (Hughes, 2004).  Exactly the same can be said of the complex \narrangements that manage horizontal networks involving joint ventures, alliances, \nlicensing agreements, knowledge transfer schemes, and the like, with outcomes linked to \ncodings such as the formal status of the agreements, auditing procedures and the alliance-\nmanagement tools.   \n \nThese inflections \u2013 together with a series of corporation-specific habits, routines, \nmanagement cultures, knowledge practices, employee relations and sociality patterns - \nmatter crucially as the rules of conduct that drive particular networks, explaining why \nstandard rules of the sort discussed in the first half of the paper yield highly differentiated \noutcomes in different locations.  In part, the variety is the product of the sheer \u2018excess\u2019 of \nregulation at work in different networks, and in part, it is the product of the interface \nbetween the scalar, largely state-led, regimes of governance and the relational, corporate-\nled, regimes.  This is not to deny any correspondence between the regimes, as this would \nbe to deny the long history of corporate influence over state policy, and vice versa4.  \n                                                 \n4 For example, Henry Yeung (2002) has argued that varying discourses of globalization (e.g. US-led attacks \non protectionism) and globalism (e.g. constructions of scalar geographies to \u2018convince social and economic \n 14\nInstead, it is to argue that in tracing the effects of TNCs in world poverty and inequality, \nit is essential to examine corporate network management practices \u2013 and their complex \nconstituent factors \u2013 since these shape employment outcomes and development potential \nin different sites within the networks.   \n \nA second example of heterarchical regulation with crucial implications for \nterritorial\/scalar policy perspectives on the potential alliance capitalism relates to the rise \nof transnational knowledge networks.  An emerging theme in development thinking is \nthat countries can survive globalization by investing in knowledge assets and the supply-\nbase in general to compete their way out of poverty.  This theme is central to proposals \nfor an international framework that allows countries to develop capabilities and \neducational opportunities (Sen, 1992), local clusters of knowledge and learning (Scott \nand Storper, 2003), and national innovation systems that bridge science, technology and \napplication in a fairer intellectual property rights regime (Stiglitz, 2002).  The anti-\nglobalization movement too, rests much of its case on the preservation of indigenous \nknowledges to meet local subsistence and human development needs, centred around \nlocalized systems of provision (Goldsmith and Mander,  2001).  All the perspectives \nshare the assumption that knowledge systems are geographically territorial.   \n \nThis assumption is not supported by the now everyday incorporation of scientific, applied \nand tacit knowledge within powerful global networks.  Indeed, in the field of \ndevelopment policy itself, the last twenty years have seen an explosion of epistemic \ncommunities and issue networks involving development agencies, foundations, think \ntanks, universities, consultancies, training agencies, individual experts, and a host of \nscripted material and shared cultures.  These networks, now \u2018a primary mechanism for \nthe spread of knowledge\u2019 (Stone, 2002: 1), defy notions of territorial knowledge \nformation, involving as they do, globally dispersed invisible colleges and chains of \nknowledge transmission, a continuously traveling expert community, extensive virtual \ncommunications, and knowledge as a mobile good.  This has become true for both \nofficial and oppositional policy on development priorities and options, with both sides \ndrawing on transnational networks that only too often draw on the same actors (e.g. think \ntanks and independent academics and consultants).   \n \nThese knowledge networks act as regulatory mechanisms, in forming media opinion, \nattracting political patronage and donor support, spreading ideas, values and specific \nprogrammes, acting as resource banks for information, and assisting governments and \ninternational organizations \u2018in the monitoring of international agreements, to undertake \npolicy evaluations, and to help diffuse analysis on international best practice\u2019 (Stone, \n2003: 7).  To read these networks as the upper tier of a new system of multi-level \ngovernance (i.e. the international level) would be misleading, even if they are aligned \nwith international NGOs and international governmental structures.  This is because, \nfirstly, as networks they operate at various spatial scales and through highly fluid, non-\nterritorial forms of organization, and secondly, because the \u2018complex, overlapping social \n                                                                                                                                                 \nactors that participation in the global economy would necessarily enhance the economic fortunes of \nnational economies\u2019, p. 298), played a vital role in the East Asian Crisis by stimulating outward investment \nand corporate reliance on external capital markets. \n 15\nmosaic\u2019 (Stone, 2003: 8) they represent are power structures in their own right, with \nelitism, gate keeping, special interest domination, advocacy, lobbying and influence as \nintrinsic elements of the network, exercising pervasive influence.  Their role in the \npolitical economy of world poverty and inequality cannot be ignored, less as a direct \ninfluence, but as drivers of policy choices made at international and local level. \n \nIt makes little sense to speak of development policies based on territorial systems of \ninnovation and\/or indigenous knowledge.  There is a new political economy of network \nknowledge from which local knowledges are not independent.  This is not simply a \nmatter of spatial scale, but a matter of new ecologies of knowledge formation that do not \nbreak down into traditional functional, corporate and geographical boundaries.  A good \nexample is the rise of project-based ecologies of innovation and learning, now extensive \nin many creative industries.  Gernot Grabher (2004a), using the examples of advertising \nand software, argues that project-based teams of innovation are \u2018both ensembles of \norganizations, communities and networks and also ecologies of organizational logics, \nprofessional ethos\u2019 and individual identities and loyalties\u2019 (p. 117).  For Grabher, \nlearning in these teams involves constant switching between core teams, firms and \nepistemic communities, a communality based on lasting and intense ties, a sociality based \non intense but ephemeral social ties, and connectivity based on transient and weak \nnetworks, all of which, in turn, involve varying spatial configurations.  The new social \ndynamics of knowledge formation \u2013 project-orientation, relational ties, communities of \npractice, sociality and reputation \u2013 though increasingly recognized in discussions on \nscience, technology and organizational learning (Amin and Cohendet, 2004), seem \ncuriously absent in mainstream development thinking.  There seems to be little \nrecognition of how these forms of organizing for creativity could be harnessed to anti-\npoverty strategies and there certainly seems to be virtually no awareness of how these \nforms are driving new cleavages between the global economic elite and their others.    \n \nThe third and final example of heterarchical regulation associated with globalization that \nI wish to discuss relates to regulatory impulses thrown up by the extraordinary increase in \nthe global migration of the poor over the last fifty years.  There is no shortage of \nliterature on the dynamics of this \u2018hydra\u2019 (Harris, 2002) that gathers immigrants as \nseasonal or contract workers with no citizenship rights (circa 20 million worldwide in the \n1990s, according to Harris, and increasingly women who account for 80% of such labour \nin Asia working as maids, factory workers, homeworkers and entertainment\/sex \nworkers); more than 30 million illegal border crossings a year for work in the informal or \nillegal economy; circa a million vulnerable women and children traded as slaves in \nprostitution and related industries, bonded labour and couriers for narcotic gangs; and \naround 25 million asylum seekers facing varying degrees of exclusion, uncertainty and \nvilification in different countries.  In turn, there is no shortage of literature relating these \ndynamics to different aspects of globalization, such as the impact of structural adjustment \npolicies and TNC practices on income and employment opportunities in developing \ncountries (Pyle, 2001), or the seductions of new forms of consumerism and global \ntourism.  Discussion on the regulatory aspects of global migration, however, has been one \nsided, with attention largely focused on what governments and the international policy \ncommunity should do to prevent out-migration through better poverty alleviation \n 16\nprogrammes and other measures to reduce vulnerability, to police the webs of organized \nhuman trade, and to improve the experience of migrants in recipient countries by relaxing \nimmigration controls and offering better rights.  These are interventions that could make \na real difference to the lives of the global poor.  One significant flaw, however, is the \ntendency to view migration as a flow in need of (public policy) regulation, rather than a \nprocess with its own intricate regulatory machinery: one that is not that easily controlled, \none that may be uncomfortably close to existing national and international policy \npriorities, and one that throws up new public policy challenges.   \n \nLet us take two examples of ordering \u2013 in the remittance economy and in the global \nsex\/drug\/incarceration complex.  Family remittances have come to play a major role in \nmany developing countries.  For example, the Central American and Caribbean countries \nrely heavily on remittances, which, in the case of Nicaragua represent a quarter of the \nnational income, and in the case of Mexico, 10 per cent of the total value of exports \n(Orozco, 2002).  These networks, as Manuel Orozco explains in the case of donations \nfrom the US, are highly organized, involving large numbers of emigrant clubs and \n\u2018hometown associations\u2019 that make charitable donations and send funds for \ninfrastructural projects, human development projects such as scholarships and libraries \nand income generation programmes.  In turn, a series of intermediaries such as couriers, \nbanks and credit unions enable the transfers, while governments in the countries of origin \nsupport elaborate schemes offering favourable interest rates, match funding, dollar bank \naccounts and exemption from import duties to encourage the remittances.  There is a \ntransnational chain of regulation using out-migration for developmental purposes, a chain \nthat, in some countries such as the Philippines, involves government-sponsored and \nprivately run schemes to prepare and train emigrants for overseas employment and ensure \ntheir regular return (Tyner, 2002).  Such examples of national development5 based on the \ncontrolled circulation of nationals and their overseas income sit uncomfortably with the \nmigration controls mentioned above.  They reveal that there is much more regulation at \nwork in the migration industry than normally assumed, one reason why proposals by \nscholars such as Nigel Harris (2002) to remove all border controls in the world to tackle \npoverty (so that supply and demand can be matched and so that the horrors of human \ntrade industry can be avoided), may not prove to be that wild or controversial, in that no \nmajor explosion of uncontrolled migration will result. \n \nSimilarly, the long, arduous and humiliating dislocations faced by women kept constantly \non the move in the global sex industry are held up by a complicated web of shadow \nregulation, fed unwittingly or otherwise by public policies at national and international \nlevel.  Ursula Biemann (2002: 86) notes that the \u2018new geography \u2026 being mapped by the \nrecruitment of women among minorities and slum communities, their transportation \nalong trafficking routes and across borders, abroad and off-shore for labour in the global \nsex industry\u2019 is \u2018not conducted by mighty syndicates\u2019, but is based on trafficking \noperations \u2018in small units, relatives or acquaintances who recruit girls in slum \n                                                 \n5 See Mohan and Zack-Williams (2002) for an account of how African transnational diaspora networks are \ncontributing to development in the countries of origin through the flow of ideas and resources based on \nremittance networks, returnee projects, religious, ethnic and community organizations, political campaigns, \ndevelopmental projects. \n 17\nneighbourhoods, frequently there are bi-national couples who have good contacts to the \nsource country\u2019.  There are many small actors in many geographical chains involved in \nmaking this trade an organized industry, including recruitment agents, money lenders, \ndocument specialists, traffickers and couriers on the supply side, and entertainment \nagencies, housing agents, communal networks, community welfare groups, pimps, \nmatriarchs and the like, on the demand side.  Supporting these chains are government \napproved schemes such as the training, licensing and accreditation of \u2018overseas \nperforming artists\u2019 in the Philippines (Tyner, 2002), and Thai investment in an \nentertainment complex that relies centrally on global sex tourism for the national \nrevenue.  But there are also significant international regulatory forces at work, such as the \npoverty effects of Washington Consensus policies, resulting in pushing women in the \nglobal south into the criminal or illicit economy.  New globalization impulses are also \nimplicated in surprising ways.  For example, the rise of a global prison industrial complex \nthat \u2018multinational prison corporations have fueled \u2026 through an aggressive strategy of \npursuing foreign market through sophisticated marketing techniques\u2019 (Sudbury, 2002: 62) \nhas draw many governments into the logic of incarceration for drug\/sex offenders, \nresulting in a spectacular rise in the women prison population.  These layered and \ndistributed regulatory impulses \u2013 official and covert \u2013 will not disappear when new \nmacro-regimes to tackle world poverty and inequality are put into place.   \n \nConclusion \n \nI suspect there are many more similar topologies of global regulation, directing, for \nexample, the everyday workings of internet communities, internet-based financial \ntrading, money laundering and the international drugs trade.  I have tried to show that \nthese orderings are as significant as it gets in the making of the contemporary world and \nin determining economic fortunes across the globe.  To perceive them as of secondary \nimportance to the meta-orders discussed in the first half of the paper, is simply to fail to \nrecognize and economic ontology composed of topological spaces, network forms of \norganization and distanciated connectivities and flows.  The deficiency lies with the \nobduracy of scalar \u2013 Russian doll \u2013 models of regulation which assume that the economy \nfalls into neat territorial packages that can be governed, in conditions of extensive \nglobalization by better inter-scalar coordination and more effective governance by global \ninstitutions.  But what if the world no longer works in this way?   \n \nAn important question raised by these micro-worlds of regulation with macro-powers is \nwhether they add up to a coherent new world order or indeed a Hayekian universe if \nsome kind in which the multiple orderings and volatile intersections between them \nconstantly defy deliberative macro-regulation or planning6.  My belief is that neither \ninterpretation necessary follows from registering the presence of micro-orders of global \nregulation.  As regards the first interpretation, John Urry (2003: 103), for example, has \nargued that the new developments amount at best to \u2018pockets of order (or ordering) \nwithin a sea of global disorder\u2019.  I think the opposite is the case.  The growing density of \nthese fractal spaces of global regulation can be considered as steps towards a new \n                                                 \n6 I am grateful to one of the referees for asking whether my argument is a Hayekian one. \n 18\nregulatory regime accreted through aggregation, overlap and filling in of gaps created by \nthe failings of territorial\/scalar regulation.  I tend to see the present as a moment of \nregulatory excess, multiple ordering (scalar, network, fluid), and slow systematicity based \non the intersections and clashes produced by the latter.  A new global regime of \ngovernance, if we can use this term, thus, is unlikely to possess the coherence of a \nmachinic order.  But then, has this ever existed in the context of systems of governance \nbased on distributed power and order?  Any coherence that is likely to emerge, therefore, \nwill be temporary, fragile, and incomplete \u2013 the product of commonalities resulting from \nthe orderings that cut the deepest channels (e.g. particular network management \ntechnologies, particular tools of distributed governance), the overarching \ngovernmentalities that come to prevail through varied processes of inducement (e.g. neo-\nliberalism, responsible capitalism), and the settlements yielded by the politics of \ngovernment and opposition across different spatial arrangements.  It will not be the \nproduct of systemic fit, system logic, or hegemonic purpose.  Perhaps the key difference \nin today\u2019s circumstances of globalization is that the role of the state in regulation has \nbecome less pivotal and that regulation through territorial jurisdiction and control has \nweakened.  This does not necessarily amount to a condition of regulatory disorder, \nsimply a change in the institutional and spatial nature of the order.   \n \nIn turn, the institutional and spatial fecundity is no Hayekian utopia or dystopia, for at \nleast two reasons.  First, there is no inverted macro-micro dynamic, where the powers of \nthe micro have replaced the powers of the macro.  The entire thrust of my argument has \nbeen to reject this dualism and its imputed hierarchy of influence and regulatory \nsignificance, in preference of a level plane made up of all kinds of hybrid.  Indeed, the \nanalysis dispels with the traditionally-held ontological distinction between \nmicroeconomic and macroeconomic regulation.  Second, my interpretation comes with an \nunderstanding of order as the product of dissonance and reconciliation between \ninstitutionalized practices of various sorts \u2013 the serious work of those with a dominating \nbent, the replication of particular discourses of governance, the gradual sedimentation of \nrecursive practices as institutional norms, the serious work of praising some models and \nvilifying others, the magic of revelation and enrolment.  These are not the forces of a \nHayekian order that settles around a republic of small autonomies and self-regulating \npropensities.  They are the forces of an order that is ordered \u2013 but always in fragile ways \nand always in ways that hurt the many - through the power-works that Foucault and more \nlatterly Actor Network approaches have been so effective in tracing. \n \nWhat are the implications of seeing globalization as the uneven play between orderings \nof different institutional composition and spatial reach for the meta-narratives discussed \nin the first part of the paper?  First, the cuts made by the tramlines of new global micro-\nordering raise some doubt over the possibility of deglobalization.  These orderings will \nbypass or blunt reforms based on reasserting state\/intergovernmental regulation (Tanzi, \n2001).  They also cast doubt over arguments in some parts of the anti-globalization \nmovement to re-embed local economies in local societies through support for subsistence \ncultures, local markets and an economy of social needs decoupled from the market \neconomy (Bello, 2002; Nash, 2003; Goldsmith and Mander, 2001).  While there is merit \nin the argument that the market economy may be of limited use to many local \n 19\ncommunities in the global south, the tacit assumption that everyday modernity and \nexteriority can be kept at bay to achieve these goals is flawed.   \n \nSecondly, the story of micro-worlds of regulation is not an argument against global-level \nreform.  Some of the proposed international reforms, especially the pro-poor and pro-\ndevelopment reorientation of the major institutions could make a real difference in \ntackling the increase in global inequality and poverty associated with neo-\nliberal\/Washington Consensus globalization.  Stricter rules on the local practices of \nTNCs, the offer of long-term developmental finance, the conversion of the IMF and \nWorld Bank into pro-South organizations, G7 openness to the demands of the anti-\nglobalization movement for better risk assessment and more humane policies, should not \nbe under estimated.  What the micro-worlds of regulation puncture, however, are the \nexpectations of regime control common to the policy literature on a new international \norder.  As systems of alternative regulation, they have the power to disrupt by organizing \neconomic life in non-territorial systems, and in ways that incorporate scalar and territorial \nrules of governance.  They too are major influences on the dynamics of poverty and \ninequality associated with contemporary globalization, possessing a power that the meta-\nnarratives are failing to address.  Their existence should really make us rethink the \nassumption circulating at the moment that while non-territorial forms of organization \nmay be rising to a penny, they are either blunted by or subordinated to actors such as \nnation states because of their historic role in managing bounded political space, still \nconsidered to be the central sphere of political regulation7.  My analysis in this paper \nquestions this assumption by attempting to show that the new micro-worlds of regulation \nare not only as \u2018political\u2019 as state-territorial forms, but that they are, in many cases, \ninterwoven with them in complex hybrid arrangements. \n \nFinally, a word on the power of dreams, which is where I think the meta-narratives of \nglobalization really do matter in terms of their global capture.  The normative debate on \nglobalization is as much a debate about possibilities for order as it is about the \nnaturalization of \u2018orders of worth\u2019 (Stark, 2000) re-narrated to the world.  This has been \nthe power of discourses of neo-liberalism, the new economy, the Third Way and attempts \nto reinvent social democracy.  With the help of an array of small objects these discourses \nhave narrated a global mind set and normativity for all to follow and be judged by.  When \nthe attendant rules have failed or been tested by the new micro-orderings, the discourses \nhave stepped in as the measure of worth - one reason why we should never \n\u2018underestimate the power of spells and dream work in the economy\u2019 (L\u00f6fgren, 2003: \n249).  This is the where the anti-globalization movement has a vital role to play, in \nnaturalizing another globalism based on \u2018personal well-being, environmental \nenhancement, social justice, human rights, space for personal creativity and technical \ninnovation, enlightened international law and regulation, the end of the war system, the \npolitics of individual and group fulfillment, the promotion of cultural expression and \npreservation, and citizen control\u2019 (Bray and Bray, 2002: 117).  Dreams?  Yes, but then \nlook at the spell cast by neo-liberalism. \n \n                                                 \n7 This is a point highlighted by the second of the two referees who commented on this paper. \n 20\nAcknowledgements \n \nI am grateful to the two referees who commented on this paper and also to participants at \nan ESRC-SSRC workshop on \u2018Money and Migration after Globalization\u2019, organized by \nNigel Thrift, Adam Tickell and Craig Calhoun, 25-28 March 2004, St Hugh\u2019s College, \nOxford University.   \n \nReferences \n \nAmin A (2002) \u2018Spatialities of globalisation\u2019, Environment and Planning A, 34, 3: 385-\n99. \nAmin  A, and P Cohendet (2004) Architectures of Knowledge: Firms, Capabilities and \nCommunities,  Oxford University Press, Oxford. \nAmin, A and N Thrift (eds.)
