Thus, it has for long\nbeen an observation in comparative criminology that data are relatively abundant for the wealthy nations of\nthe world and relatively sparse for the rest. For example, the International Crime Victim Survey has one or\nmore national samples for countries in Western Europe and the New World, but only single city samples\nfor many other countries. The first International Self-Report Survey on Juvenile Delinquency was likewise\nconfined to countries with sufficient resources and research traditions to collect the data (see, generally,\nNewman, 1999).\nVenezuela is typical of many other Latin American countries in that it has a relatively low rate of\ndata production in criminology and makes only rare appearances in international studies. Accordingly, the\nannouncement of plans to undertake a second international self-report survey on juvenile delinquency\nprovided a good opportunity to collect valid and reliable data on juvenile delinquency in a Latin American\ncountry, thereby adding an interesting and geographically distinct case to the ISRD-2 sample of countries.\nA survey instrument as comprehensive as that used in the ISRD-2 study allows the exploration of\nmany different sets of variables relating to the possible causes of juvenile delinquency and responses to it.\nHowever, it is impossible to undertake a detailed analysis of all these variables in a preliminary report such\nas this. Accordingly, in this chapter we present and discuss the first results from the ISRD-2 survey in\nVenezuela, focusing on the prevalence of delinquent behaviors and some of its correlates. Rather than\ndeveloping our analysis within the confines of a pre-selected theoretical framework, we proceed\ninductively by paying most attention to those variables showing the strongest associations with delinquent\nbehavior. Many of those variables describe what we initially identify as disorderly environments, but on\ncloser inspection the latter can be narrowed down to deviant peers.  As we indicate in the conclusion to this\nchapter, deviant peer groups and deviant peers may have explanatory value for the study of individual\ndelinquent behavior, and warrant further exploration. Our case study is prefaced with a description of\nVenezuela and the data collection procedures that were used.\nVENEZUELA\nVenezuela is a South American country of 27.5 million inhabitants (INE, 2007a) that stretches\nfrom the Amazonian basin and Guiana Highlands in the south, across the Orinoco basin and the Andean or\ncoastal mountain ranges to the Caribbean in the north. From the Sixteenth Century onwards it was\ncolonized by the Spanish and attained its formal independence from Spain in 1830. Three racial groups met\nand mixed during and after that time: the indigenous tribes that had lived in the territory since long before\nColumbus arrived, the Caucasians who colonized it, and the Africans who were brought in as slaves up to\nthe mid-Nineteenth Century. Racial categories have grown blurred over time and their social significance\nhas been attenuated, although it has not disappeared: currently, two thirds of the population are considered\nto be mestizo (a mixture of indigenous and Caucasian blood) (PDVSA, 1997).\nThe rural, agrarian-based, economy of the Nineteenth Century was rapidly transformed during the\nTwentieth Century with the discovery of oil. Venezuela is the ninth largest oil producer in the world, and\nthe fifth largest exporter (EIA 2007); oil accounts for about 30% of the GDP, 50% of government income\n(CIA 2007) and 85% of the country\u2019s export earnings (ECLAC 2006). Following an unprecedented period\nof prosperity in the 1960s and 1970s, the economy went into sharp decline in the 1980s, with rising levels\nof poverty and inequality. However, the resurgence of oil prices during the first years of the new\nmillennium, coupled with more social spending by the government, has done something to reverse this\nsituation (Crespo 2006, WIDER 2007). Currently, Venezuela\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) is slightly\nabove the average for Latin American countries, but only about one seventh of the GDP of the wealthiest\ncountries in the world (World Bank, 2007).\nDuring the second half of the Twentieth Century population growth was quite rapid[2] and was\naccompanied by a shift to urban areas.  Currently, 87% of the population lives in settlements of more than\n2,500 inhabitants (INE, 2007b). One result of population growth is that Venezuela is a young country: 33%\nof the population is under 15 years old, 63% is between 15 and 64 years old, while only 4% is 65 or older\n(INE, 2002). Correspondingly, Venezuelan children grow up in quite large households, nearly half of\nwhich comprise four to six people (INE, 2006). Children also grow up under a diversity of family\narrangements: of the nearly six million households in the country, 37% are headed by married couples,\n32% by couples who are cohabiting,[3] 22% by women and the rest (9%) by men (INE, 2006).\nVenezuela has almost eliminated illiteracy - it was estimated at 6.4% in 2001 (INE, 2002) - and is\nclose to achieving universal education for its young people. Almost 100% of children and adolescents in\nthe ages corresponding to \u201cBasic Education\u201d (First through Ninth Grades, 6 to 14 years old) are in school,\nand official figures show a dropout rate of only 3.9% for the school year 2004\/05 (INE, 2007c). Many\nadolescents continue for a further two years (\u201cDiversified Education\u201d) to complete their secondary\neducation, but fewer go on to university. Nevertheless, overall in 2001 two thirds of the population aged 7\nto 24 was studying (INE, 2002). Once young people leave school or university, the prospects in the labor\nmarket are not bright. Not only is the official unemployment rate quite high - 16.8% in 2006 (World Bank,\n2007) \u2013 but about half of employed people are working in the informal sector (characterized by low wages,\ninstability and a lack of welfare benefits) (INE, 2006). Thus, despite the relatively abundant oil income,\npoverty is widespread: one third of the population is classified as poor (household income does not cover\nbasic expenditures) and one tenth lives in \u201cextreme poverty\u201d (income does not cover the cost of food)\n(INE, 2006).\nWhile people often cite unemployment as the country\u2019s most pressing problem, crime has recently\ntaken the lead, according to an ongoing national opinion survey (PROVEA, 2006). Over the last 20 years,\nreported crime rates have been broadly stable, but there have been notable exceptions for certain kinds of\nviolent crime (CONAREPOL, 2006; Crespo, 2006). During the 1990s, murder rates doubled from 13 to 25\nper 100,000 inhabitants and then nearly doubled again to 44\/100,000 by 2003, decreasing to 37\/100,000 by\n2005 (PROVEA, 2006). Since 2000, kidnappings have also increased rapidly, from 67 to 206 per year\n(PROVEA, 2006). While not the most violent of Latin American countries (Brazil, Colombia and El\nSalvador have the highest rates), Venezuela is above the average (Londo\u00f1o, Gaviria & Guerrero, 2000) and\nits capital city (Caracas) has markedly higher rates than the rest of the country (Brice\u00f1o-Le\u00f3n & P\u00e9rez\nPerdomo, 2002). The level of serious violence in Venezuela is also much higher than that in Western\nEurope and North America. Recent high profile abduction and murder cases have generated considerable\nlevels of concern for personal safety (Birkbeck and Gabald\u00f3n, 2009).\nDATA COLLECTION\nThe project team elected to use the city-based sampling strategy proposed by the ISRD-2 Steering\nCommittee. The large urban area chosen was Caracas, located in the coastal mountains in the centre of the\ncountry and with an estimated population (in 2001) of 2,758,917  (INE, 2007d). The medium-sized urban\narea chosen was the city of M\u00e9rida, located in the western, Andean, region of the country and with an\nestimated population (in 2000) of 300,000  (GBV, 2006a). Finally, three small urban areas were chosen for\ntheir relative accessibility for the research team from either the large or medium-sized city: Altagracia de\nOrituco (approximately 42,000 inhabitants in 2000 (GBV, 2006b)), which is located to the south east of\nCaracas in Gu\u00e1rico State; Lagunillas (approximately 20,000 inhabitants (GBV, 2006a), 20 kilometers\noutside of M\u00e9rida; and San Casimiro, a small town of less than 15,000 inhabitants (GBV, 2006c) located in\nAragua State to the south best of Caracas.[4]\nThe target sample size was 2,150 students, aiming for 700 students each in Caracas and M\u00e9rida,\nand 250 students each in Altagracia de Orituco, Lagunillas and San Casimiro. An estimated global non-\nresponse rate of 40% was factored in, to cover for the loss of respondents through a variety of causes: the\nrefusal of schools to participate in the survey, the unavailability of a class during the days on which the\nsurvey team visited the school, student absences from class on the day or time when the survey was\nadministered, and blank or unusable questionnaires.[5] Thus, the initial sample size would be\napproximately 3,600 students. No stratification variables were used.\nThe target population for the survey were students in 7th, 8th and 9th grades of Basic Education\n(ages generally ranging between 12 and 15). Students were to be sampled by the \u201csection\u201d (i.e., class) they\nwere enrolled in, and in order to generate a complete listing of classes for the purposes of sample selection,\ninformation (in Excel files) was obtained from the Ministry of Education\u2019s regional offices on all schools\nand all classes at 7th, 8th and 9th grade levels in the urban areas chosen for the study. After checking and\ncleaning this data, the ISRD Survey Manager tool was used to generate a random sample of classes. A total\nof 125 classes at 69 schools were selected, giving an estimated student population of 3,811. With a 40%\nnon-response rate, the final sample size was projected to be 2,286 students.\nThe questionnaire used in the survey was the standard version developed by the Steering\nCommittee and contained no additional country-specific questions. The questionnaire was translated into\nSpanish by a team of four students who are fluent in English. This draft was then reviewed by the\nVenezuelan team leader (who is bilingual, and whose task was to check for any errors in translation). No\nmajor language problems were detected that required the modification or elimination of questions, or\nresponse options, from the standard version of the questionnaire. Because computers are not widely\navailable in Venezuelan schools, the questionnaire was designed to be administered in a paper version.\nThe fieldwork was carried out by a team of fully trained researchers and undergraduate students\nfrom the Universidad de Los Andes in the city of M\u00e9rida, who also traveled to the other urban areas\nincluded in the sample. Data collection began on April 24 2006 and ended on May 12.  Because parental\nconsent forms were not used, the key factor determining overall response rates to the survey was\nparticipation or non-participation at school level. Of the 69 schools included in the sample, 47 (68%)\nagreed to participate. Generally, a school did not participate because of a flat refusal from the Director or\nbecause of difficulties in arranging for the survey during the time allotted for the fieldwork.\nIn the schools that agreed to participate in the survey, cooperation was usually very good at all\nlevels: the director and associate personnel, the teachers and the students themselves. Teachers helped the\ninterview teams to get the class group ready for survey administration, and in the great majority of cases\nthe class groups were orderly and filled out the survey instrument in silence. Many students appeared to\ntake the survey very seriously, and often expressed their interest in its content to project staff.[6] However,\nmany students also commented (either to the interview team or on the instrument itself) that they felt the\nsurvey to be very long.[7] When the instruments were subsequently transcribed for data processing, it\nbecame apparent that a considerable number of students experienced either difficulty or tedium as they\nanswered the questionnaire. This suggests that the survey instrument was not completely attuned to the\nexperience, capability and attention span of Venezuelan students. It would be interesting, and important, to\nexplore alternative formats for the application of this kind of survey in the Venezuelan context.\nNon-participation by schools eliminated 877 students, leaving an estimated total of 2,934 students\nin the schools that agreed to participate in the survey. In all, 2,395 usable questionnaires were collected (in\n94 classes), indicating a loss of 18% of students due to absence or non-participation in the survey. The\nresponse rate was 82% of students at schools that agreed to participate in the survey and 62% of the\nstudents at all schools. This means that the overall non-response rate for the original sample was 38% (very\nclose to the estimated figure \u2013 40% - that was used in sample calculation). Table 1 shows student response\nrates by city. These were highest for Lagunillas and M\u00e9rida and lowest for Altagracia de Orituco and\nCaracas. In Altagracia de Orituco the low response rate was largely determined by the failure to locate two\nof the five schools in the sample,[8] while in Caracas the response rate was affected mainly by the absence\nof school directors or by a greater insistence on the need to obtain authorization for the survey from the\nMinistry of Education.\nTable 1 about here\nRESULTS\nTable 2 shows the lifetime and recent prevalence of delinquent and other problem behaviors for the\nwhole sample, and broken down by Caracas\/other urban areas. What is most striking about these results is\nthat the prevalence of most delinquent behaviors is very low, especially during the recent period (the\nprevious twelve months for all behaviors except drug use, for which \u201crecent\u201d refers to the previous four\nweeks). For example, only 4.3% of respondents reported ever having shoplifted (only 1.5% during the\nprevious twelve months) and only 1.3% had ever used marijuana. Overall, these results are quite similar to\nthose found in previous surveys on drug use and delinquency in Venezuela using localized samples and\ndifferent  questionnaires (Birkbeck, 1995), and they suggest that deviant behavior, particularly serious\ndeviant behavior,  is not very frequent among Venezuelan adolescents.\nTable 2 about here\nThe most frequent behavior recorded was downloading music or films from internet, but this must\nbe interpreted in terms of a culture of contraband that prevails in Venezuela, where pirate copies of music,\nfilms and software are readily and cheaply available from street vendors. Thus, downloading music or\nfilms is generally seen as both normal and acceptable and it is difficult to consider it as a deviant\nbehavior.[9] Among the clearly delinquent behaviors measured in the survey, the highest prevalence was\nfound for group fighting (16.1% lifetime prevalence), followed by damaging something on purpose (7.7%),\nshoplifting (4.3%) and carrying a weapon (4.2%). On almost all measures, the prevalence for Caracas\nrespondents was higher than for respondents in other urban areas, but not greatly so.\nIn order to examine variables associated with involvement in delinquent behavior, a summary\nmeasure of prevalence was calculated. For reasons stated above, computer offences were not included in\nthis measure; however, in contrast to some other countries in the ISRD-2 project, marijuana use was\nincluded because it is considered a deviant behavior in Venezuela and generally thought to be a crime.[10]\nThe summary measure of prevalence was scored 1 if the respondent reported one or more of the behaviors\nlisted in Table 2 (except computer offences) during the previous twelve months (or previous four weeks for\ndrug offences), and 0 if they reported none of them. Overall, 11.2% of the sample had a prevalence score\nof 1 and represents the group of adolescents (which we will call \u201cdelinquents\u201d) that is of particular interest\nfor this project. In the following analyses, we compare this group with the rest of the sample (\u201cnon-\ndelinquents\u201d) in order to identify variables that are significantly associated with the probability of being\ndelinquent. We use contingency tables and the chi-square statistic to identify significant variables and\nCram\u00e9r\u2019s V to assess the strength of the association between the variables.\nTable 3 shows the results for socio-demographic variables. In common with other studies of crime\nand delinquency, boys in the sample were more likely than girls to have engaged in delinquent behaviors\n(15.8% versus 6.8%), but unlike many other studies age was not associated with delinquent behavior.[11]\nFamily living arrangements were not significantly associated with engagement in delinquent behavior and\nthus it made no difference whether adolescents lived with their mothers and fathers, their mothers only, or\nwith other people (for example, with mother and stepfather, with father only, or with grandparents). The\nmarked matricentric character of most Venezuelan households means that, irrespective of the specific\ncomposition of the family group, children are almost always brought up by a significant female (usually\nthe mother, but possibly the grandmother or an aunt). Finally, a simple measure of socio-economic\nlevel[12] shows some rather surprising results, in that adolescents from homes with greater material\nprovision were more likely to report recent engagement in delinquent behaviors. Perhaps a greater feeling\nof empowerment among the students from wealthier backgrounds is accompanied by a greater disposition\nto misbehave.\nTable 3 about here\nWhen variables measuring family interactions, school and neighborhood are examined, the results\nare rather mixed. For brevity, Table 4 shows a sample of such variables, with two drawn from each\ncategory. Whether or not students got along with their mothers\/stepmothers was not significantly\nassociated with recent involvement in delinquent behavior; neither was the frequency with which students\nundertook leisure activities with their parents. Other variables measuring family interactions were either\nunrelated or weakly related to delinquent behavior.\nTable 4 about here\nBy contrast, dissatisfaction with school and truancy were both quite strongly associated with\ninvolvement in delinquent behavior. The prevalence of delinquency was nearly twice as great among\nstudents who did not like school. Similarly, as truancy increased so did delinquent behavior: one quarter of\nstudents who had skipped class three or more times during the previous twelve months had been involved\nin delinquency. Most of the other variables in the survey that measure attitudes to school, or the school\nenvironment, were significantly associated with the prevalence of delinquency.\nFinally, variables measuring attitudes towards the neighborhood were generally unrelated, or only\nweakly related, to the prevalence of delinquency. For example, when students reported that people in their\nneighborhoods do not get along, the probability of involvement in delinquent behavior was significantly\nhigher (although not greatly so). However, whether or not neighbors notice and talk about the students\u2019\nown bad behavior was not related to participation in delinquency, a type of finding that was similar for\nseveral other variables measuring neighborhood interaction. The exception to this pattern was found for\nvariables measuring the presence of crime and deviance in the neighborhood, all of which were associated\nwith a greater prevalence of delinquent behavior. Similarly, variables describing delinquent behavior in\nschools were also associated with a higher prevalence of delinquency among respondents, as was one\nvariable describing family deviance (parents had problems with drugs or alcohol). These findings, some of\nwhich are summarized in Table 5, point to the considerable relationship between disorderly environments\nand the subject\u2019s own delinquent behavior, a process that we examine in more detail in the next section.\nTable 5 about here\nDisorderly Environments\nThe results exemplified in Table 5 indicate that when adolescents perceived themselves to be in family,\nschool or neighborhood settings where there is crime and deviance, they were more likely to report their\nown involvement in delinquent behavior. For example, respondents reporting a parent with alcohol or drug\nproblems were nearly twice as likely to have engaged in delinquent behavior. Similarly, respondents\nreporting more crime at school or in the neighborhood were more likely to have been delinquents\nthemselves.\nAnother setting of great importance to personal behavior is the peer group, and the results from the\nsurvey indicate that when respondents were more actively engaged with peers, and when the peer group\nshowed greater levels of deviant or delinquent behavior, respondents also showed higher frequencies of\ninvolvement in delinquent behavior, sometimes considerably more. Table 6 shows that when respondents\nspent most of their free time on their own, the prevalence for recent delinquency was 10.4%, but when they\nspent it with a relatively large group of friends, the prevalence was 19.0%. When respondents reported that\nthey did not spend time with a particular group of friends the prevalence for recent delinquency was 5.0%,\nbut when they did spend time with a specific group of friends, the prevalence was 13.6%. When\nrespondents reported that people in the group did not do illegal things together, the prevalence for recent\ndelinquency was 10.6%, but when the group did illegal things the prevalence jumped to 40.5%. Similarly,\nwhen respondents did not consider their group of friends to be a gang, the prevalence for delinquency was\n11.1%, but when the group of friends was considered to be a gang the prevalence of delinquency was\n27.3%. Not surprisingly, when respondents reported that group activities included deviant or delinquent\nbehavior, their own involvement in delinquency was greater. For example, when the peer group never used\nalcohol or drugs, respondents\u2019 prevalence for delinquency was 9.2%, but when the peer group used alcohol\nor drugs, the prevalence jumped to a startling 53.7%. When the peer group did not vandalize things just for\nfun, the prevalence was 8.5%, but when it did, the prevalence was 30.4%.[13]\nTable 6 about here\nThese last results might appear somewhat tautological in that, if the respondent has engaged in\ndelinquent behavior, then by definition the peer group will have engaged in delinquent behavior. However,\nit is clear from the last two contingency tables in Table 6 that there is no perfect overlap between the peer\ngroup\u2019s behavior and the respondent\u2019s behavior: not all respondents who engaged in delinquent behavior\nbelonged to delinquent groups, while many respondents who belonged to delinquent groups did not report\ndelinquent behavior.[14] Moreover, additional data shows that much delinquent behavior was a group\nactivity and not simply the work of the respondent. Table 7 shows the proportion of most recent incidents\nin which respondents reported that peers were also involved. For vandalism and most property crimes the\nproportion of incidents involving both the respondent and peers was between two thirds and four fifths.\nThe exception was pickpocketing, where only 23.1% of incidents also involved peers, a finding which may\nbe explained by the fact that pickpocketing is a crime of particular stealth for which large groups of\nconfederates may be a hindrance. In general, however, delinquent acts involved joint participation by\nrespondents and their peers.\nTable 7 about here\nA final aspect contributing to disorderly environments is the experience of victimization. Table 8\nshows the recent prevalence of four types of victimization (robbery\/extortion, assault, theft and bullying)\nfor the whole sample, for Caracas and for the other urban areas. Rates of victimization were quite low,\nexcept for theft (affecting about one quarter of the sample), and \u2013 as is to be expected - rates for Caracas\nwere somewhat higher than in the other urban areas. Overall, 29.8% of the total sample reported being\nvictimized by any of these behaviors; about half being victimized once and the rest more than once. Results\nfrom a contingency table (not included here for reasons of space) show that when respondents were not\nvictimized, the prevalence for delinquency was 7.8%; when they were victimized once, the prevalence rose\nto 14.1%; and when victimized more than once, the prevalence rose to 18.9% (p = .000, V = .132). The\ndata in the current study do not indicate the temporal sequence of victimization and delinquent behavior, so\nno causality can be inferred. The most that can be said is that adolescents with a greater prevalence of\ndelinquency moved in environments where personal victimization was also more frequent.\nTable 8 about here\nBecause the preceding results involve bivariate analysis, it is possible that some of the significant\nassociations between variables hide simpler underlying patterns of association. For example, the\nprevalence rates for delinquency were higher among respondents who were more likely to say that there\nwas a lot of crime and related deviant behavior in their schools and neighborhoods; but prevalence was\nalso higher for respondents who had themselves been victimized. It is therefore possible that the experience\nof victimization led respondents to perceive more crime in their schools or neighborhoods. Thus, the\nperceived level of crime in schools and neighborhoods might not be unrelated to the experience of\nvictimization, such that at bivariate level each variable shows a significant association with the prevalence\nof delinquency, although one of these variables may have a more direct influence on prevalence than the\nother. In order to test for this possibility, and to identify the variables with a direct influence on prevalence,\nmultivariate analysis is required. In this case, with a dichotomous dependent variable measuring prevalence\n(0 = No recent delinquency, 1 = Recent delinquency), logistic regression was used to test for significant\nassociations with variables previously considered in this chapter. Initially, several different models were\ntried in order to identify variables that showed the strongest associations with delinquency at multivariate\nlevel. Except for two variables (gender and socioeconomic level), models using socio-demographic\nvariables did not perform well, which is to be expected from the bivariate results presented previously.\nSimilarly, a model examining attitudes to, and experiences in, education showed that only liking\/disliking\nschool and truancy were associated with delinquency. Models using variables that capture disorderly\nenvironments did much better, although many variables that showed significant associations with\ndelinquency at the bivariate level ceased to show them in the multivariate model. Given the limitations on\nspace, we here present and briefly discuss the results from a final composite multivariate model (including\nboth socio-demographic variables and variables measuring disorderly environments), which illustrates the\npattern of findings that emerges from the data. [15]\nTable 9 shows that in multivariate analysis several variables measuring the disorderly environment\ncontinue to be significant predictors of self-reported delinquency, together with two socio-demographic\nvariables.[16] When activities with friends involved the use of alcohol and drugs, vandalism and the\nfrightening\/annoying of other people, respondents were more likely to report their own delinquent\nbehavior.[17] The odds ratios (Exp(b) in the table) show that when group activities involved a lot of\nalcohol or drugs, the odds of respondents\u2019 own delinquent behavior increased threefold, while group acts\nof vandalism increased the odds by two and half times. Similarly, when respondents had friends who used\ndrugs or committed robberies, they were more than twice as likely to report delinquency. Note, therefore,\nthat group engagement in delinquent behaviors and having friends who engaged in delinquent behaviors\nwere partially separate influences on the probability of the respondent\u2019s own delinquent behaviour.\nInterestingly, all of the variables measuring perceptions of delinquency and deviance in the school\nand neighborhood cease to show a significant relationship with self-reported delinquency, indicating that\nthe bivariate relationships detected previously are accounted for by other variables in the model. Likewise,\nattachment to school and truant behavior are not associated with delinquency, although truant behavior\ncomes close to significance.\nThe number of victimizations continues to be significantly associated with respondents\u2019 own\ndelinquency: each victimization incident increases the odds of delinquency by 45%. Of the socio-\ndemographic variables, gender continues to be a significant predictor of delinquency, with males being\nalmost twice as likely as females to report delinquency in the survey. Socioeconomic level is also\nsignificant, although its influence is quite weak: each point of increment is associated with a 7.8% increase\nin the odds of delinquency. Finally, a control variable specifying the urban area where respondents live\ndoes not show a significant relationship with the prevalence of delinquency. Thus, the somewhat higher\nprevalence of delinquent behaviors in the capital city is accounted for by variables other than the size of the\nurban area.\nOverall, the results of multivariate analysis suggest that the initial concept of the disorderly\nenvironment can be narrowed to that of disorderly peers or, to phrase it rather differently, deviant groups\nand deviant peers. Male adolescents who spend their time with groups that engage in deviant or delinquent\nacts, or who have peers that engage in those acts, are more likely to be deviant themselves. Part of the\ndeviant experience also involves being a victim. Indeed, it may well be that in this kind of context there is\nsometimes no clear distinction between offenders and victims.\nCONCLUSION\nIn general, Venezuelan secondary school students appear to have quite low levels of delinquency,\nespecially serious delinquency, or at least a low disposition to report such behaviors in a survey.[18]\nSetting aside computer activities (because downloading music or films is considered relatively normal in\nVenezuela, while the term \u201chacking\u201d was misunderstood), the most frequent delinquent behavior reported\nin the survey was group fighting (16.1% lifetime prevalence), but for all other behaviors the lifetime\nprevalence was less than 10%, for most it was less than 5% and for many it was under 1%. Given the other\nresults presented here, it is perhaps not surprising that group fighting was the most frequent type of\ndelinquent behavior reported, because the activities of the peer group were strongly associated with the\nadolescent\u2019s own level of involvement in delinquent and deviant behaviors.\nWhile bivariate analysis identifies many significant variables, which describe adolescents\u2019\ninteractions with peers, the nature of peer group activity, the perceptions of crime and deviance in the\nschool or neighborhood, and the experience of victimization, multivariate analysis reveals that it is the\ndeviant nature of peer and peer group activity, together with victimization, which (along with gender and\nsocioeconomic level) emerge as the significant predictors of delinquent behavior. There is, of course, some\noverlap here because the adolescent\u2019s own delinquent behavior when with a group would make the group\ndelinquent. However, the fact that many (often most) of the recent acts captured by the survey were\nreported as being committed with peers (rather than simply with peers present) suggests that this is not\nmerely a case of the respondent\u2019s actions defining those of the group, but that the dynamics of delinquent\nbehavior grow out of interactions within the group. Much delinquency is therefore to be considered a group\nphenomenon rather than individual behavior. Thus, the proximity of the two sets of behaviors \u2013 those of\nthe individual and those of the group \u2013 should be treated less as analytical redundancy and more as an\ninvitation to reflect on the complex interactions between adolescents and their peers in the genesis of\ndelinquency and deviance.\nThe \u201cgroup nature\u201d of delinquency is one of the most firmly established findings in research, at\nleast in the United States, although its specific characteristics remain largely unstudied and their theoretical\nsignificance strongly debated (e.g., Erickson & Jensen, 1977; Warr, 1996). The findings presented here are\nan invitation to explore the data from our ISRD-2 study in greater depth and, eventually, to conduct\nadditional research to try and illuminate these matters. Such an enterprise is of particular importance in\nVenezuela where, with a few notable exceptions (e.g., del Olmo, 1979), the analytical focus has been\noverwhelmingly on the individual juvenile delinquent.\nREFERENCES\nBirkbeck, C.

Solbey Morillo is Aggregate\nProfessor of Criminology at the Universidad de Los Andes. Freddy Crespo is Instructor in Criminology,\nUniversidad de Los Andes. Data collection in Venezuela was financed by the Consejo de Desarrollo\nCient\u00edfico, Human\u00edstico y Tecnol\u00f3gico at the Universidad de Los Andes under project D-298-05-09-A.\n[2] For example, the rate of population growth during the 1990s was 2.3% per year (INE, 2007b).\n[3] Cohabitation (called concubinato or uni\u00f3n libre in Venezuela) is more frequent among the poor and\ngenerally less enduring than marriage.\n[4] Care was taken in the selection of small cities that are not dormitory settlements for medium or large\ncities. Altagracia de Orituco is three hours\u2019 drive from Caracas and is a small administrative centre in a\npredominantly agricultural zone. Lagunillas is a small commercial centre in an agricultural zone and has\nonly a few residents who commute to work, or to the university, in the nearby city of M\u00e9rida. San\nCasimiro, approximately one hour\u2019s drive from the nearest city (Maracay) and two and a half hours\u2019 drive\nfrom Caracas, is also located in an agricultural zone.\n[5] Parental consent forms were not used. These are almost unknown in Venezuelan survey research.\nHowever, students were given the opportunity not to participate in the survey by simply leaving the\ninstrument blank and handing it in with all the others.\n[6] In countries with a strong research tradition (i.e., Western Europe and the New World), surveys of\nschool students are quite frequent and must be programmed with care to avoid collision or overload. This\ndoes not happen in Venezuela: surveys of school students are still quite rare, particularly in rural areas.\nThis worked to the research team\u2019s favor because the data collection was a quite unusual or novel\nexperience, both for school personnel and students, which helped to stimulate curiosity about the survey\nand a willingness to participate.\n[7] Students took an average of 45 minutes to complete the questionnaire, with some finishing in 30\nminutes and others taking as long as an hour.\n[8] Similarly, one of the schools selected for the sample in Lagunillas could not be located. Project\npersonnel did not query the Ministry of Education about these cases because over the years there have been\nscandals involving \u201cghost schools\u201d in which the physical plant and students are non-existent but the payroll\nis definitely functioning. In other words, ghost schools are a form of corruption. We do not here affirm that\nthe non-existent schools in Lagunillas and Altagracia de Orituco fell into this category, but we felt that to\nquestion the Ministry about these cases might have led to the perception that we were undertaking an\ninvestigation into corruption, and this would have undoubtedly raised barriers to institutional access for the\nproject.\n[9] The data on hacking should also be treated cautiously, but for a different reason. The term hacking was\ntranslated using the Hispanicised slang (hackear) that is current among the cyber-literate in Venezuela, but\nmany students (particularly in the small towns) did not know what it meant (as revealed by their questions\nin class) and appeared to think that it referred to chatting over the internet (which is usually referred to as\nchatear in Venezuela). Thus, the data on hacking are of dubious validity.\n[10] Marijuana and the other drugs mentioned in the ISRD-2 survey are included in Venezuelan drug laws.\nFor all these drugs, the law distinguishes between \u201cpersonal use\u201d and possession (with the implied intent to\nsell), trafficking, and so on. Personal use is not strictly a crime, although if detected it leads to criminal\nproceedings and a \u201csentence\u201d to treatment (Venezuela, 2005).\n[11] The finding on age is not, however, dissimilar to the findings from previous self-report surveys\nconducted in Venezuela (Birkbeck, 1995).\n[12] Socioeconomic level was calculated by assigning 1 point for each of the following: respondent has\nown room at home; respondent has access to a computer at home; respondent owns a mobile phone; and\nfamily owns a car. The minimum score would therefore be 0 and the maximum score would be 4.\n[13] Similar results were found for shoplifting and frightening\/annoying other people. When respondents\nreported that their peer groups engaged in those behaviors, the prevalence of self-reported delinquency was\nsignificantly higher.\n[14] Similar results were found when specific types of delinquent behavior were compared (e.g., groups\nuse of alcohol\/drugs with respondent\u2019s use of alcohol drugs; group\u2019s shoplifting with respondent\u2019s\nshoplifting), so these findings are not simply an artifact of the cumulative measure of delinquency reported\nhere. Respondents were also asked if they had friends that used drugs, shoplifted, or committed burglary,\nrobbery or assault. In all cases, having friends who are delinquent was significantly associated with a\ngreater probability of the respondent\u2019s own delinquency, but the overlap was not complete.\n[15] The predictive power of logistic regression models is measured by goodness-of-fit statistics such as\nthe Cox and Snell R2 and the Nagelkerke R2. The model discussed here has a Nagelkerke R2 of .303, the\nhighest for any of the models tested in the analysis.\n[16] Given the relatively large sample size, the criterion for significance used here is p <.01.\n[17] Note that shoplifting is an exception: peer group shoplifting is not associated with the respondent\u2019s\ncumulative delinquent behavior. Specific analyses of the data on shoplifting in the survey show a rather\ncomplex pattern. Table 7 shows that two thirds of recent shoplifting incidents were committed with peers,\nwhile additional bivariate analysis (not included in the tables) shows that approximately two thirds of\nshoplifters also said that their peer group did not shoplift. Although belonging to a peer group that shoplifts\nsignificantly increased the probability of the respondent\u2019s own shoplifting, it appears that much shoplifting,\nalthough committed with others, was not part of the activities in the respondent\u2019s regular peer group. The\nneed for stealth in shoplifting may well militate against its emergence as a \u201ccollective\u201d behavior.\n[18] As in many countries, of course, the most serious delinquents may have dropped out of school or be in\nstate residential facilities, so that they do not appear in samples drawn from ordinary educational\ninstitutions.\n"}
