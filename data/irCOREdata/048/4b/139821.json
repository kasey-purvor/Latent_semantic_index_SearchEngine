Introduction\nWeighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes [13, 9] for hyper-\nbolic conservation laws combine the very high order of spatial accuracy in\nsmooth regions of the solution and quasi-monotone behavior at discontinu-\nities. The main idea behind the construction of WENO methods is to com-\nbine the low-order reconstruction polynomials with the specially designed\nweights in such a way that the resulting reconstructed value is of higher or-\nder of accuracy than those from each of lower order polynomials for smooth\n\u2217Corresponding author\nEmail addresses: p.tsoutsanis@cranfield.ac.uk (P.

These properties make WENO methods a good choice for long-time\nevolution flow problems requiring both shock-capturing ability and uniformly\nhigh accuracy in smooth areas with rich structures.\nOn structured meshes the WENO schemes are relatively easy to imple-\nment and computationally not very expensive and thus have been used for a\nnumber of studies, e.g. [16, 8]. The extension to unstructured meshes have\nso far been carried out for triangular\/tetrahedral elements only [5, 14, 3, 23].\nHowever, practical applications of high-order methods require the use of\nmixed-element meshes, consisting of a variety of elements, such as hexa-\nhedral and prismatic cells. This is because in the numerical modelling of vis-\ncous flows such cells are typically used inside the boundary layers where the\nrest of the computational domain is discretised by tetrahedrals. Therefore,\nthe development of WENO methods capable of using general mixed-element\nmeshes is vital if this class of schemes is to be applied to real-world problems.\nThe motivation of the present work is to extend the schemes from [3, 4] to\narbitrary three-dimensional mixed-element unstructured meshes, consisting\nof all four possible element types: hexahedral, tetrahedral, prismatic and\npyramidal. The extension is based on a new stencil construction procedure,\nwhich is suitable for arbitrarily-shaped cells elements and results in a reduced\nnumber of stencils for tetrahedral elements. The presented numerical results\nfor to scalar and nonlinear system cases show that the new schemes achieve\nthe very high order of spatial accuracy across interfaces between cells of\ndifferent types and in the same time essentially non-oscillatory profiles are\nproduced for discontinuous solutions. Since the goal of the present paper is\nto develop the basic methodology for the construction of WENO methods on\nmixed-element meshes, the calculations are limited to Cartesian geometries\nmostly, except one test case, in which the flow over three-dimensional slender\nbody is considered.\nThe paper is organised as follows.In Section 2 a detailed explanation of\nboth linear and nonlinear reconstruction for a scalar variable is provided.\nThis reconstruction can be viewed as an extension of the WENO methodol-\nogy proposed in [3, 4]. The application of the developed techniques to the\ncompressible Euler equations is discussed in Section 3. Section 4 presents\nnumerical results, which demonstrate the very high-order accuracy of the\nresulting methods, their essentially non-oscillatory properties as well as illus-\ntrate the influence of the mesh quality on the accuracy of the calculations.\nConclusions are drawn in Section 5.\n2\n  \n2. Arbitrary order reconstruction on mixed-element meshes\nIn this section a reconstruction procedure for mixed-element unstructured\nmeshes in three-space dimensions is described to be used later for the con-\nstruction of a WENO method. Without loss of generality the idea can be\nexplained as applied to a scalar variable u(x, y, z). Suppose that the spatial\ncomputational domain is discretized by conforming elements Vi of the vol-\nume |Vi|, indexed by a unique mono-index i. The center of the element has\ncoordinates (xi, yi, zi). The elements considered are of hexahedral, tetrahe-\ndral, pyramidal and prismatic shapes, as illustrated on Fig. 1. The main goal\nof the reconstruction procedure is to build high-order polynomial pi(x, y, z)\nsuch that it has the same cell average as u on the target cell Vi\nu\u00afi =\n1\n|Vi|\n\u222b\nVi\nu(x, y, z) dV =\n1\n|Vi|\n\u222b\nVi\npj(x, y, z) dV (1)\nand in the same time approximates the point-wise values of u inside the cell\nwith the given order of accuracy r:\nu(x, y, z) = pi(x, y, z) + const \u00b7 hr, h \u2248 |Vi|1\/3 (2)\nTo build up this polynomial, the reconstruction procedure will use the cell\naverages of u(x, y, z) on the target cell Vi as well as averages u\u00afm from the\nreconstruction stencil formed by neighboring cells Vm.\nIn order to simplify the notation, in this section the global spatial index i\nis omitted and the local numbering of cells is introduced. The reconstruction\nproblem can thus be reformulated as follows: for a target cell V0 build a\nhigh-order polynomial p(x, y, z) so that its spatial average on cell V0 is equal\nto u0 and approximates point-wise values of u with rth order of accuracy.\n2.1. Linear (central) reconstruction\nIn general, the reconstruction can be carried out in the physical coordi-\nnates x = (x, y, z), taking special measures against scaling effects. A more\nelegant and computationally accurate approach, however, is to use the so-\ncalled reference coordinate system (\u03be, \u03b7, \u03b6), as was suggested in [3] for triangu-\nlar (2D) and tetrahedral (3D) elements. Here this transformation technique\nis extended to deal with general mixed-element mesh elements.\nThe basic steps of the transformation procedure proposed in the present\nwork can be summarized as follows. Firstly, if the cell V0 is not tetrahedral, it\n3\n  \nis decomposed into tetrahedrons. The number of these tetrahedral depends\non the type of element V0 and is equal to two for a pyramid, three for a prism\nand finally six for a hexahedral cell. Next, the linear transformation and\nthe corresponding Jacobian matrix from physical coordinate system (x, y, z)\ninto the reference coordinate system (\u03be, \u03b7, \u03b7) are defined using one of the\ntetrahedral elements resulting from the decomposition. Finally, the cell V0\nand other cells in the reconstruction stencil are transformed into the reference\nspace.\nLet w1 = (x1, y1, z1), w2 = (x2, y2, z2), w3 = (x3, y3, z3), w4 = (x4, y4, z4)\nbe the four vertices of one of the tetrahedral elements the target element V0\nconsists of. The transformation from the Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) into\na reference space (\u03be, \u03b7, \u03b6) is defined as\uf8eb\uf8ed xy\nz\n\uf8f6\uf8f8 =\n\uf8eb\uf8ed x1y1\nz1\n\uf8f6\uf8f8+ J \u00b7\n\uf8eb\uf8ed \u03be\u03b7\n\u03b6\n\uf8f6\uf8f8 , J =\n\uf8ee\uf8f0 x2 \u2212 x1 x3 \u2212 x1 x4 \u2212 x1y2 \u2212 y1 y3 \u2212 y1 y4 \u2212 y1\nz2 \u2212 z1 z3 \u2212 z1 z4 \u2212 z1\n\uf8f9\uf8fb (3)\nwith J is the Jacobian matrix If the target cell V0 is in fact tetrahedral, then\n(3) reduces to the mapping introduced in [3]. Eq. 3 defines both the direct\nand inverse mappings from \u03be = (\u03be, \u03b7) into x = (x, y), which are denoted as\nx = x(\u03be), \u03be = \u03be(x) (4)\nVia the inverse mapping the element V0 can be transformed to the element\nV \u20320 in the reference coordinate system. Note that for the uniform (Cartesian)\nhexahedral mesh the transformed element V \u20320 is just a unit cube in the refer-\nence space (\u03be, \u03b7, \u03b6), whereas for a general hexahedral element as well as for\nprismatic and pyramidal cells four of the vertices of the transformed element\nwill be from the unit cube.\nFor performing the reconstruction on the target element V0, the so-called\ncentral reconstruction stencil S is formed which consists of M + 1 elements,\nincluding the target element V0:\nS =\nM\u22c3\nm=0\nVm\nwhere the local index m counts the elements in the stencil S. The central\nstencil is build up recursively by adding the direct side neighbors of the\nelement V0 and all of the elements already existing in the stencil, until the\n4\n  \ndesired number of elements is reached. The neighbors are added irrespective\nof their shape. The inverse mapping (4) is then applied to all the elements Vm\nfrom the reconstruction stencil S and the transformed elements and stencil\nare denoted as E \u2032m and S \u2032, respectively:\nS \u2032 =\nM\u22c3\nm=0\nV \u2032m\nFig. 2 shows an examples of a central stencil the physical coordinate sys-\ntem for the linear third order reconstruction; the target cell V0 has direct\nneighbors of all four types.\nThe reconstruction polynomial at the transformed cell V \u20320 is sought as an\nexpansion over local polynomial basis functions \u03c6k(\u03be, \u03b7, \u03b6):\np(\u03be, \u03b7, \u03b6) =\nK\u2211\nk=0\nak\u03c6k(\u03be, \u03b7, \u03b6) = u\u00af0 +\nK\u2211\nk=1\nak\u03c6k(\u03be, \u03b7, \u03b6) (5)\nwhere ak are degrees of freedom and the upper index in the summation of\nexpansion K is related to the degree of the polynomial r by the expression\nK =\n1\n2\n(r + 1)(r + 2)(r + 3)\u2212 1.\nThe basis functions \u03c6k are constructed in such a way that condition (2) is\nsatisfied identically irrespective of values of degrees of freedom:\n\u03c6k(\u03be, \u03b7, \u03b6) \u2261 \u03c8k(\u03be, \u03b7, \u03b6)\u2212 1|V \u20320 |\n\u222b\nV \u20320\n\u03c8k d\u03bed\u03b7d\u03b6, k = 1, 2, . . .\n{\u03c8k} = \u03be, \u03b7, \u03b6, \u03be2, \u03b72, \u03b62, \u03be \u00b7 \u03b7, . . .\n(6)\nThe unknown degrees of freedom ak are found by requiring that for each\ncell V \u2032m, m = 1, . . .M , from the stencil S \u2032 the cell average of the reconstruc-\ntion polynomial p(\u03be, \u03b7, \u03b6) be equal to the cell average of the solution u\u00afm:\n1\n|V \u2032m|\n\u222b\nV \u2032m\np(\u03be, \u03b7, \u03b6) d\u03bed\u03b7d\u03b6 = u\u00af0 +\n1\n|V \u2032m|\nK\u2211\nk=1\n\u222b\nV \u2032m\nak\u03c6k d\u03bed\u03b7d\u03b6 = um. (7)\nIn general, in order to compute the degrees of freedom ak we need at least\nK cells in the stencil, different from the target cell V0. However, the use of the\n5\n  \nminimum possible number of cells in the stencil M \u2261 K results in a scheme\nwhich may become unstable on general meshes. It is therefore recommended\nto use more cells in the stencil then the minimal required number [2, 11, 3].\nAlthough it is usually sufficient to use 50% more cells, on mixed-element\nmeshes it may be safer to increase the stencil further. We typically select\nM = (1.5 . . . 2) \u00b7 K. The resulting over-determined system (7) is solved by\nmeans of the least-square procedure.\n2.2. WENO reconstruction on mixed-element meshes\nThe WENO reconstruction proposed in the present work is an extension\nof the approach from [3] to mixed-element meshes, consisting of elements of\narbitrary shapes. The WENO reconstruction stencils is a union of several\nreconstruction stencils Sm, m = 0, 1, . . . ,ms. These are one central stencil\nand several one-sided, or sectorial, stencils. The construction of the central\nstencil S0 was outlined in the previous sections. The sectorial stencils are\nobtained by adding only those neighboring cells, centres of which lie inside\nthe given sector. In [3] eight sectorial stencils are used for a tetrahedral ele-\nment, which include four primary sectors and four additional so-called reverse\nsectors. This is already quite computationally demanding for tetrahedral el-\nements, which have four faces, and becomes too expensive for other type of\nelements, which have more faces. In the present work a different procedure\nfor defining the directional sectors is adopted, which is approximately two\ntimes more efficient. The direction stencils are formed by the barycenter and\nedges of the faces as illustrated in Fig. 3. Namely, the planes C12, C13 and\nC23 define the directional stencil sector for the triangular face whereas the\nplanes C12 , C23 , C34 , C41 make the sector for the quadrilateral face.\nHere C is the barycentre of the element. In other words, the number of sec-\ntorial stencils in our schemes is usually equal to the number of faces of the\ncell ms = L. Note, that the number of stencils may be smaller near solid\nboundaries. Overall, our reconstruction procedure thus uses a significantly\nsmaller number of stencils compared to the original construction [3].\nFigs. 4 \u2013 6 illustrate the directional WENO stencils for a particular cell\nV0 of the mixed-element unstructured mesh. Alls stencils are plotted in the\nphysical coordinate system and correspond to the central stencil, shown on\nFig 2. Here, the target element V0 is hexahedral and is marked on the plots of\ndirectional stencils. Note that there are in total six mixed-element directional\nstencils, attached to each of six faces of the element V0.\n6\n  \nThe WENO reconstruction polynomial is now defined as a non-linear\ncombination of reconstruction polynomials pm(\u03be, \u03b7, \u03b6), obtained by using in-\ndividual stencils Sm:\npweno =\nms\u2211\nm=0\n\u03c9mpm(\u03be, \u03b7, \u03b6) (8)\nSubstituting the form of the individual polynomial (5) corresponding to the\nstencil Sm\npm(\u03be, \u03b7, \u03b6) =\nK\u2211\nk=0\na\n(m)\nk \u03c6k(\u03be, \u03b7, \u03b6)\nand further reordering yields the final expression for pweno:\npweno = u\u00af0 +\nK\u2211\nk=1\n(\nms\u2211\nm=0\n\u03c9ma\n(m)\nk\n)\n\u03c6k(\u03be, \u03b7, \u03b6) \u2261 u\u00af0 +\nK\u2211\nk=1\na\u02dck\u03c6k(\u03be, \u03b7, \u03b6) (9)\nHere a\u02dck are the new values of degrees of freedom, modified according to the\nWENO procedure. As is usual in WENO methods [9, 14], the nonlinear\nweights \u03c9m are defined as\n\u03c9m =\n\u03b3m\nms\u2211\nm=0\n\u03b3m\n, \u03b3m =\ndm\n(\u03b5+ ISm)p\nwhere dm are the so-called linear weights, ISm are smoothness indicators, \u03b5\nis a small number used to avoid division by zero and finally p is an integer\nparameter, controlling how fast the non-linear weights decay for non-smooth\nstencils. We typically use \u03b5 = 10\u22126 and p = 4.\nThe selection of linear weights dm is based on [3]. The central stencil is\nassigned a large linear weight d0 = 10\n2 . . . 103 whereas the sectorial stencils\nare assigned smaller weights dm = 1. This selection of the weights is mo-\ntivated by the fact that for smooth solutions the central stencil is usually\nthe most accurate one. The oscillation indicators ISm of each stencil is a\nmeasurement of how smooth the solution is on this stencil. Due to the use of\nthe reference coordinate system, scaling is already taken out of the problem\nand ISm can be computed in a mesh-independent manner as\nISm =\n\u2211\n1<|\u03b2|<r\n\u222b\nV \u20320\n(\nD\u03b2pm(\u03be, \u03b7, \u03b6)\n)2\nd\u03bed\u03b7d\u03b6 (10)\n7\n  \nwhere \u03b2 is a multi-index, r is the order of the polynomial and D is the\nderivative operator. The general form of B in three space dimensions can\nbe found in [3]. It is easily seen that the smoothness indicators (10) are\nquadratic functions of the degrees of freedom a\n(m)\nk and thus the expression\n(10) can be rewritten in terms of the so-called universal oscillation indicator\nmatrix [3]. For purely tetrahedral meshes this matrix does not depend on\nthe element. For general elements it will, however, depend on the element.\nFor efficiency, it can be precomputed and stored at the beginning of the\ncalculations for each element Vi.\n3. Application to the compressible Euler equations\n3.1. The framework\nThe developed WENO reconstruction technique is applied to solve nu-\nmerically the three-dimensional compressible Euler equations of the form\n\u2202\n\u2202t\nU+\n\u2202\n\u2202x\nF(U) +\n\u2202\n\u2202y\nG(U) +\n\u2202\n\u2202z\nH(U) = 0, (11)\nwhere U is the vector of conserved variables, F, G, H are flux vectors in x,\ny and z coordinate directions respectively, given by\nU =\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\u03c1\n\u03c1u\n\u03c1v\n\u03c1w\nE\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 , F =\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\u03c1u\n\u03c1u2 + p\n\u03c1uv\n\u03c1uw\n(E + p)u\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 , (12)\nG =\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\u03c1v\n\u03c1vu\n\u03c1v2 + p\n\u03c1vw\n(E + p)v\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 , H =\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\u03c1w\n\u03c1wu\n\u03c1wv\n\u03c1w2 + p\n(E + p)w\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 . (13)\nHere \u03c1 is density, u,v,w velocity components in the x, y and z directions,\nrespectively, p pressure, E = p\/(\u03b3 \u2212 1) + (1\/2)\u03c1(u2 + v2 + w2) total energy,\n\u03b3 is the ratio of specific heats; \u03b3 = 1.4 is used throughout.\n8\n  \nSpatial integration of (11) over a mesh element Vi yields the following\nsemi-discrete finite-volume method:\nd\ndt\nUi +\n1\n|Vi|\n\u222e\n\u2202Vi\nFndA = 0,\nFn (U) = F (U)nx +G (U)ny +H (U)nz,\n(14)\nwhere n = (nx, ny, nz) is outward unit normal vector to cell faces, Ui(t) are\nthe cell averages of the solution at time t, Fn - projection of the flux tensor on\nthe normal direction. The integral over the element boundary \u2202Vi is split into\nthe sum of integrals over each face Aj resulting in the following expression:\nd\ndt\nUi = Ri, Ri = \u2212 1|Vi|\nL\u2211\nj=1\n\u222b\nAj\nFn,jdA = \u2212 1|Vi|\nL\u2211\nj=1\nKij (15)\nHere the numerical flux Kij corresponding to the face j of the cell Vi is the\nsurface integral of the projection of the tensor of fluxes onto the outward unit\nvector nj for face Aj. In a numerical method the exact integral expression\nfor the numerical flux Kij for the face j of a cell Vi is approximated by a\nsuitable Gaussian numerical quadrature:\nKij =\n\u222b\nAj\nFn,jdA =\n\u2211\n\u03b2\nFn,j (U(x\u03b2, t))\u03c9\u03b2|Aj| (16)\nwhere the subscript \u03b2 corresponds to different Gaussian integration points\nx\u03b2 and weights \u03c9\u03b2 over the face Aj.\nThe temporal derivative in (14) is approximated by the third-order TVD\nRunge-Kutta method [9]:\nU\n(n+1\/3)\ni = U\nn\ni +\u2206tRi(U\nn),\nU\n(n+2\/3)\ni =\n3\n4\nUni +\n1\n4\nU\n(n+1\/3)\ni +\n1\n4\n\u2206tRi(U\n(n+1\/3)),\nUn+1i =\n1\n3\nUni +\n2\n3\nU\n(n+2\/3)\ni +\n2\n3\n\u2206tRi(U\n(n+2\/3)).\n(17)\nThe time step \u2206t is selected according to the formula\ndt = K min\ni\nhi\nSi\n(18)\n9\n  \nwhere Si is an estimate of the maximum (in absolute value) propagation\nspeed in cell Vi, K \u2264 1\/3 is the CFL number, hi is the characteristic length\nof the element Vi.\nThe description of the scheme is complete once a reconstruction procedure\nto calculate the point-wise values from cell averages and a numerical flux\n(building block) of the scheme are specified.\n3.2. Reconstruction for systems\nCalculation of a numerical flux (16) through the face Aj of a cell Vi re-\nquires the knowledge of point-wise values of the conserved vector U at the\nGaussian points. These values are obtained by the WENO reconstruction\nprocedure on mixed-element meshes, developed in the previous section and\nextended here in to vector variables, which are solutions of the compressible\nEuler equations. The reconstruction produces the high-order vector poly-\nnomials Pi(\u03be, \u03b7, \u03b6) defined in the local reference coordinate system of each\nelement Vi. The simplest approach to the construction of these polynomi-\nals is to apply the scalar reconstruction procedure (9) to each component of\nthe conserved vector U. However, for systems better results are obtained if\nthe reconstruction procedure is carried out in characteristic variables. Our\napproach for extending the scalar reconstruction to the characteristic-based\nreconstruction is very similar to that of [4], although different in some re-\nspects, and thus we only outline the main steps.\nConsider the cell Vi and the corresponding set of directional stencils in\nthe local reference coordinate system {S \u2032m}, m = 0, 1, . . .ms. The vector of\ndegrees of freedom A\n(m)\nik for each stencil are calculated using the scalar recon-\nstruction procedure in the component-wise fashion. Then, the corresponding\npolynomials are given by\nPim(\u03be, \u03b7, \u03b6) =\nK\u2211\nk=0\nA\n(m)\nik \u03c6ik(\u03be, \u03b7, \u03b6) = U\u00afi +\nK\u2211\nk=1\nA\n(m)\nik \u03c6ik(\u03be, \u03b7, \u03b6), (19)\nwhere \u03c6ik are basis functions for cell Vi in the local reference coordinate\nsystem.\nDefine at the arithmetic average of the conserved vector Ui and the con-\nserved vector Ui\u2032 , corresponding to the computational cell, adjacent to the\nface Aj of the current cell Vi:\nU\u2032n =\n1\n2\n(Ui +Ui\u2032).\n10\n  \nLet Rj, Lj be the matrices containing the right and left eigenvectors of the\nJacobian matrixHj, corresponding to the normal projection of the flux tensor\ncalculated at this average state\nHj =\n\u2202Fn\n\u2202U\n|U=U\u2032n ,\nwhere Fn is defined in eq. (14). The characteristic projections of vector\ndegrees of freedom of each stencil Sm, including the cell averaged value UI ,\nare computed as\nB\n(m)\nikj = LjA\n(m)\nik , m = 0, . . . ,ms, k = 0, . . . K.\nThe scalar WENO reconstruction algorithm is applied to each component\nof the projected degrees of freedom. The resulting modified degrees of free-\ndom B\u02dc\n(m)\nikj are projected back to by multiplying them by Rj. The WENO\nreconstruction polynomial for the face Aj is then given by\nPij(\u03be, \u03b7, \u03b6) = U\u00afi +\nK\u2211\nk=1\nA\u02dcikj\u03c6ik(\u03be, \u03b7, \u03b6), A\u02dcikj = RjBikj. (20)\nNote, that the degrees of freedom in eq. (20) depend on the face index\nj. Finally, the reconstructed values at Gaussian integration points are then\ngiven by\nPi(\u03be\u03b2, \u03b7\u03b2, \u03b6\u03b2) = U\u00afi +\nK\u2211\nk=1\nA\u02dcikj\u03c6ik(\u03be\u03b2, \u03b7\u03b2, \u03b6\u03b2), (21)\nwhere (\u03be\u03b2, \u03b7\u03b2, \u03b6\u03b2) are the coordinates of Gaussian points in the reference\ncoordinate system for the face Aj of the cell Vi. This completes the recon-\nstruction step.\nAn additional step in the reconstruction process was used in [4]. Namely,\nfor each cell Vi the least oscillatory of all Pij is taken as the unique recon-\nstruction polynomial Pi and then used for all faces. In the present work this\npart of the characteristic-wise reconstruction process is omitted in order to\nreduce the computational cost.\n3.3. Numerical flux\nAfter the reconstruction is carried out, for each computational cell the\npoint-wise values of the conserved vector U are represented by high-order\n11\n  \nreconstruction polynomials. Since these polynomials are different, at each\nGaussian point \u03b2 in the expression for the numerical flux (16) for the face Aj\nof cell Vi two approximate values for the conserved vector U exist. The first\nvalueU\u2212\u03b2 corresponds to the spatial limit to the cell boundary from inside the\ncell Vi and is given by the reconstruction polynomial Pi. The second value\nU+\u03b2 corresponds to the spatial limit from outside the element and is obtained\nby using the reconstruction polynomial of the neighboring element Vi\u2032 . The\nvalues U\u00b1\u03b2 are usually called left and right boundary extrapolated values.\nIn upwind Godunov-type methods the resulting discontinuity is resolved by\nreplacing the physical flux at each Gaussian integration point by a monotone\nfunction of left and right boundary extrapolated values so that (22) can be\nrewritten as\nKij \u2248\n\u2211\n\u03b2\nFn,j\n(\nU\u2212\u03b2 ,U\n+\n\u03b2\n)\n\u03c9\u03b2|Aj| (22)\nThe function F\u02dcn,j\n(\nU\u2212\u03b2 ,U\n+\n\u03b2\n)\nis called the Riemann solver [6], or a building\nblock of a high-order scheme.\nReview of existing exact and approximate Riemann solvers for various\nhyperbolic systems can be found in [12, 19]. Using the concept of the ro-\ntational invariance [19], for each face Aj the normal projection of the flux\ntensor Fn,j is replaced by\nFn,j = T\n\u22121F (TjU) (23)\nwhere Tj is the (constant) rotation matrix for face j. Then the expres-\nsion (22) for Kij is rewritten as\nKij =\n\u2211\n\u03b2\nFn,j\n(\nU\u2212\u03b2 ,U\n+\n\u03b2\n)\n\u03c9\u03b2|Aj| =\n\u2211\n\u03b2\nT\u22121F\n(\nU\u02c6L, U\u02c6R\n)\n\u03c9\u03b2|Aj| (24)\nwhere U\u02c6j is the rotated conserved variable and\nU\u02c6L = TjU\n\u2212\n\u03b2 , U\u02c6R = TjU\n+\n\u03b2\nIt follows from (24) that the flux function for the Gaussian point \u03b2 can be\ncomputed from the augmented one-dimensional Riemann problem\n\u2202\n\u2202t\nU\u02c6+\n\u2202\n\u2202s\nF\u02c6 = 0, F\u02c6 = F(U\u02c6), U\u02c6(s, 0) =\n{\nU\u02c6L, s < 0,\nU\u02c6R, s > 0\n(25)\n12\n  \nAssuming a three-wave structure with wave speed estimates SL, S\u2217 and\nSR the HLLC flux is given by\nF\u02c6HLLC =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\nF\u02c6L, if 0 \u2264 SL ,\nF\u02c6\u2217L = F\u02c6L + SL(U\u02c6\u2217L \u2212 U\u02c6L) , if SL \u2264 0 \u2264 S\u2217 ,\nF\u02c6\u2217R = F\u02c6R + SR(U\u02c6\u2217R \u2212 U\u02c6R) , if S\u2217 \u2264 0 \u2264 SR ,\nF\u02c6R, if 0 \u2265 SR ,\n(26)\nwhere\nU\u02c6\u2217K = \u03c1K\n(\nSK \u2212 uK\nSK \u2212 S\u2217\n)\n\uf8ee\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0\n1\nS\u2217\nvK\nwK\nEK\n\u03c1K\n(S\u2217 \u2212 uK)[S\u2217 + pK\n\u03c1K(SK \u2212 uK) ]\n\uf8f9\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb\nfor K = L and K = R. The wave speeds SL, S\u2217 and SR must be estimated.\nHere the procedure for pressure-velocity estimates of Sect. 10.5.2 of [19] are\nused.\nIt is worth noting that HLLC flux contains all waves in the Riemann\nproblem solution, does not use linearization of the equations and works well\nfor low-density problems and sonic points without any fixes. The HLLC flux\nhas been recently used in a number of very high-order methods, with good\nresults, see e.g. [22, 18, 21].\n4. Numerical examples\nIn this section the numerical results of the new schemes are presented as\napplied to both smooth and discontinuous solutions in three space dimensions\nof the schemes of up to fifth order accuracy. The schemes of spatial order\nr are denoted as WENO\u2212r, e.g. the spatially fifth order scheme is denoted\nas WENO-5. Since only third-order accurate time evolution method (17) is\nused, the resulting methods are of only third order of formal accuracy. For\nthe numerical schemes up to 3rd-order of spatial accuracy all convergence\ntests are run with a fixed Courant number K = 0.3. However for higher than\n13\n  \nthird order numerical schemes for convergence studies with smooth solutions\nthe time-step size is reduced according to (27)\n\u2206t = K \u00b7\u2206r\/3 (27)\nwhere \u2206 is a characteristic cell size, r stands for the order of the scheme\nfor r > 3. This allows the spatial-order of accuracy to dominate the com-\nputation. If uniformly fourth and high order of accuracy is required under\nthe conventional time-step restriction, then an ADER-type time evolution\napproach is recommended [20, 21, 3, 4, 15].\nOne of the advantages of explicit methods used here is that they can be\neasily parallelized based on domain decomposition. The mesh decomposition\nprocess is the preprocessor step which is one of the most essential elements\nfor an equal load balance between processes in terms of memory requirements\nand communications between processes. In the present work it is carried out\nusing the METIS software package [10], which has been shown to work well\nfor very high order accurate unstructured solvers on tetrahedral meshes [4].\nThe process chosen for decomposition is to convert the mesh into a nodal\ngraph rather than using a dual graph in order to derive a partitioning of the\nnodes. The load balancing achieved with the METIS software package for\nthe meshes used ranges between 1.00 and 1.07 for any type of unstructured\nmesh. of the scheme employed. The calculations were carried out on the\nHPC Facility \u2019Astral\u2019 of the Cranfield university. Astral is a Hewlett Packard\nHPC, comprising 856 Intel Woodcrest cores with 2Gb of RAM per core and\nclock frequency of 3.0GHz. With the present implementation overall parallel\nefficiency of our methods is above 90% for up to 128 processors used.\n4.1. Linear advection with a smooth initial condition\nThe methods are applied to the linear constant-coefficient advection equa-\ntion\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n+\n\u2202u\n\u2202x\n+\n\u2202u\n\u2202y\n+\n\u2202u\n\u2202z\n= 0 (28)\nwith a smooth initial condition defined in a cube [0, 1]3\nu0(x, y, z) = sin (2pix) \u00b7 sin(2piy) \u00b7 sin(2piz) (29)\nThe periodic boundary conditions are applied. The unstructured meshes\nused in calculations are constructed as follows. First the number of cells\nNedge over each edge of the cube is specified. Then, for each Nedge four\n14\n  \nsequences of meshes are constructed, corresponding to purely hexahedral\nmesh, purely tetrahedral mesh, purely prismatic mesh and a mixed-element\nmesh, consisting of cells of all element types. The purely hexahedral mesh\nis further perturbed in order to make it non-uniform. The total number of\ncomputational cells in the domain is then denoted as Ntot and is a function of\nboth Nedge and the type of elements used inside the computational domain.\nTable 1 provides a summary of the mesh composition for each mesh sequence.\nCutaway sections for the case Nedge are shown on Fig. 7.\nTables 2 \u2013 5 shows the convergence studies for cell averages for the solu-\ntion. The errors are calculated the output time t = 1 Both linear (central\nstencil) and non-linear WENO schemes are employed. It is observed that\nall schemes reach the designed order of accuracy. Note that hexahedral and\nprismatic meshes Nedge = 10 do not have enough elements to employ fifth-\norder schemes since the stencils extend more than half a period in length,\nleading to incorrect computational results.\nThe results from the third-order schemes, contained in Tables 2 \u2013 5, makes\nit possible to study the relative efficiency of different types of unstructured\nmeshes. It is obvious that for a given number of boundary cells Nedge the\nhexahedral mesh leads to less accurate results are compared to meshes made\nof elements with fewer number of nodes: tetrahedral and prismatic ones.\nHowever, in practical applications the numerical error should be taken as\na function of the computational time, which is in turn proportional to the\ntotal number of cells Ntot, the number of time steps Nt, required to reach\nthe selected output time and the computational cost required to compute the\nnumerical fluxes for one cell. Generally speaking, for the WENO schemes the\nhexahedral element is costlier for flux calculations than tetrahedral, prismatic\nor pyramidal one due to the larger number of sectorial stencils used. However,\nit also allows one to run with a significantly large time step. For the linear\nschemes with the central stencil the cost of the reconstruction for different\ncell types is very comparable, whereas the differences in time step size remain\nsignificant.\nIt is obvious that for any given value of Nedge, the prismatic and tetrahe-\ndral meshes are superior to hexahedral meshes in terms of L1 and L\u221e error\nnorms. This is due to the fact that prismatic and tetrahedral cells are smaller\nthan the corresponding hexahedral ones, resulting in finer mesh resolution,\nbut also leading to 4 to 14 times large computational times for the same\nvalue of Nedge. If instead the computational error is taken to be function of\nthe total number of elements and the number of time steps required to reach\n15\n  \nthe output time, then the hexahedral meshes are slightly more efficient than\nany other elements.\n4.2. Two-dimensional vortex evolution problem\nThe three-dimensional Euler equations (11)\u2013(13) are solved in the com-\nputational domain [0, 10]\u00d7[0, 10]\u00d7[0, 0.5] with periodic boundary conditions.\nThe initial condition corresponds to a smooth two-dimensional vortex placed\nat the centre of the x-y plane [5, 5]. The vortex is defined as the following\nisentropic perturbation of unit values of primitive variables [1]:\nu =\n\u03b5\n2pi\ne\n1\u2212r2\n2\n(5\u2212y), v =\n\u03b5\n2pi\ne\n1\u2212r2\n2\n(x\u22125), w = 0,\nT =\n(\u03b3 \u2212 1) \u03b52\n8\u03b3pi2\ne(1\u2212r\n2),\np\n\u03c1\u03b3\n= 1, r2 = (x\u2212 5)2 + (y \u2212 5)2\n, (30)\nwhere the vortex strength is \u03b5 = 5. The exact solution is a vortex movement\nin the x\u2212 y plane with a constant velocity at 45o to the Cartesian axis. The\nnumerical solution is computed at the output time t = 10 (one period) for\nwhich the vortex returns to the initial position. Periodic boundary conditions\nare applied.\nThe construction of the meshes for this test case is similar to the linear\nadvection convergence study. The edges of the computational in x, y plane\nare mesh with Nedge number of cells, whereas the z direction is discretized\nwith a fixed number of cell equal to 20. Then, the interior is meshed using\ncells of different types. The summary of the mesh statistics can be found in\nTable 6.\nTables 7 \u2013 10 show errors and convergence rates in L1 and L\u221e norm for\ncell averages of density. It is observed that both linear and WENO schemes\nachieve the expected convergence rates for all meshes, including the mixed-\nelement ones. For a fixed resolution the fifth-order schemes are more accurate\nthan the third order ones by one to two orders of magnitude.\n4.3. Blunted-cone-cylinder-flare test case\nFinally, the third-order WENO method is applied to calculate the su-\npersonic flow over a realistic three-dimensional geometry. We consider the\nso-called the blunted-cone-cylinder-flare geometry, designated HB-2. The\ngeometry has been used extensively in aerodynamic test facilities [7]. The\n16\n  \ncorresponding high-speed flow is a suitable test of the robustness of the pro-\nposed methods as applied to real-life applications.\nThe geometry of the problem is shown in Fig. 8, where d is the reference\nlength. In the computational setup the x axis is directed along the body. The\ncomputational domain (including the wake region) was meshed by two hybrid\nunstructured meshes of different resolution. Figure 9 illustrate schematically\nhow the computational mesh was constructed. Although most of the com-\nputational cells are hexahedral, near the axis the mesh contains prisms and\nis thus of mixed-element type. In actual computations the mesh consisted\nof 690040 cells and was partitioned into 32 blocks for parallel computations,\nsee Figure 10.\nThe computations were performed for the free-stream Mach number equal\nto 5 at zero angle of attack Fig. 11 shows the pressure distribution along\nthe body, normalized by the post-shock stagnation pressure p0 and plotted\nagainst longitudinal position. The spatial coordinate is normalised by the\nlength of the body L. Also shown is experimental data from [7] (symbols).\nIt is observed that the numerical solution provided by the WENO-3 method\nagrees very well with the experimental measurements, including fine details.\nFig. 12 shows the pressure distribution, computed on the same mesh using\na TVD method. It is seen that the TVD method provides lower accuracy\neven though the flow is dominated by relatively flow structures, such as shock\nwaves.\n5. Conclusions\nThis paper has focused on the development of three-dimensional WENO\nschemes for arbitrary-element unstructured meshes. The extension is based\non a new stencil construction procedure, which is suitable for arbitrarily-\nshaped cells elements. A detailed description of the reconstruction step of\nschemes is provided allowing for its practical implementation by a reader.\nThe new schemes have been applied to a number of well-established test\nproblems with both smooth and discontinuous solutions. The presented nu-\nmerical results demonstrate that the new schemes achieve the designed order\nof accuracy for hexahedral, tetrahedral, prismatic and pyramidal elements,\nwhich is maintained across interfaces between cells of various types. Also, the\ncomputation of discontinuous solutions is not affected by interfaces between\nneighbouring cells of different types.\n17\n  \nThe future developments will consist of two directions. First is the exten-\nsions to the ADER approach [20, 21, 3, 4, 15], which will allow an arbitrary\nhigh-order accurate time evolution as opposed to the third-order accurate\nTVD Runge-Kutta method used in the present work. Second direction is the\nincorporation of the second-order derivatives. The preliminary results for the\ncompressible Navier-Stokes equations can be found in [17], where the linear\nthird-order method is presented. In the non-linear method the WENO recon-\nstruction, developed in the present work, should be used for computing the\nconvective flux only whereas the viscous and heat conduction terms are still\ncomputed using the linear central stencil reconstruction. The corresponding\nresults will be reported elsewhere.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to thank Dr. Michael Dumbser, University of\nTrento, Italy, for various discussions concerning very high order methods on\nunstructured meshes.\nReferences\n[1] Balsara, D., Shu, C.-W., 2000.
