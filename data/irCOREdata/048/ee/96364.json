This\napproach, which we refer to as the \u2018global deal\u2019\nstrategy, is predicated on the idea of negotiating a\ncomprehensive, universal and legally binding treaty\nthat prescribes, in a top-down fashion, generally\napplicable policies based on previously agreed\nprinciples. From a review of the history of the \u2018global\ndeal\u2019 strategy from Rio (1992) to Kyoto (1997) and\nbeyond we conclude that this approach has been\nproducing diminishing returns for some time, and that\nit is time to consider an alternative path \u2013 if not goal \u2013\nfor climate policy. The alternative that, in our view, is\nmost likely to move the world closer towards a\nworking international climate regime is a \u2018building\nblocks\u2019 approach, which develops different elements of\nclimate governance in an incremental fashion and\nembeds them in an international political framework.\nIn fact, this alternative is already emergent in\ninternational politics. The goal of a full treaty has been\nabandoned for the next climate conference in Mexico,\nwhich is instead aiming at a number of partial\nagreements (on finance, forestry, technology transfer,\nadaptation) under the UNFCCC umbrella. For this to\nproduce results, a more strategic approach is needed to\nensure that \u2013 over time \u2013 such partial elements add up\nto an ambitious and internationally coordinated\nclimate policy which does not drive down the level of\naspiration and commitment.\nPolicy Implications\n\u2022 The current approach to negotiating a comprehen-\nsive, universal and legally binding \u2018global deal\u2019 on\nclimate change is unlikely to succeed. A strategic\nrethink is needed on how to advance global climate\nprotection in the current global political and eco-\nnomic environment.\n\u2022 An alternative approach is the \u2018building blocks\u2019\nstrategy, which develops different elements of cli-\nmate governance in an incremental fashion and\nembeds them in a broader political framework. In\nfact, such an approach is already emergent in post-\nCopenhagen international climate politics.\n\u2022 The building blocks approach offers the hope of\nbreaking the current diplomatic stalemate but\nremains a second best scenario. It promises no swift,\nshort-term solutions, risks strengthening the logic\nof free-riding and may lead to excessive regulatory\nfragmentation.\n\u2022 A more strategic, long-term vision is required for\nthe building blocks model to lead to the creation of\nan ambitious international architecture for climate\nprotection and prevent the slide into a purely de-\ncentralised, \u2018bottom-up\u2019 approach.\nHow should governments respond to the apparent failure\nof the 2009 Copenhagen conference on climate change?\nInitial reactions by diplomats and observers were domi-\nnated by profound disappointment, even despair, at the\ninadequate outcome of the two-week-long negotiations.\nFor many, the Copenhagen Accord represents what is\nwrong with international climate diplomacy: cobbled\nGlobal Policy Volume 1 .

In the face of a\ngrowing sense of the urgent need to act against global\nwarming, it eschews tough and legally binding commit-\nments on mitigation; and despite the worldwide recogni-\ntion that developing countries will suffer most from climate\nchange, the promises for funding of adaptation measures\nremain vague. Many more NGOs, business leaders and\nothers engaged in climate efforts are now looking for alter-\nnative governance arrangements outside the seemingly\ndeadlocked diplomatic route.\nOnce the dust had settled, however, the tone of the\ndebate began to change. Analysts started to note quiet\nrelief among negotiators that Copenhagen did not cause\nthe international process to collapse altogether. Indeed, the\nthree-page Copenhagen Accord, however perfunctory its\ncontents, accepted the need to hold mean temperature\nincreases below 2\u0003C and explicitly endorsed the dual-track\nclimate negotiations under the UN Framework Convention\non Climate Change (UNFCCC). It contains in its\nAnnexes the first (non-binding) pledges by all major econ-\nomies to rein in emissions, including from non-Annex I\ncountries. Furthermore, the Accord establishes the princi-\nples for a system of international monitoring, reporting and\nverification and paves the way for an increase in future\nfunding for developing countries. After a brief period of\nstocktaking and mutual recrimination, negotiators quickly\nregrouped and set about preparing for the next Conference\nof the Parties (COP-16), to be held in Cancun, Mexico,\nfrom 29 November to 10 December 2010. It seems as if\nclimate diplomacy is back on track, even if Copenhagen\nhas lowered expectations.\nWhat can be hoped for in the future international pro-\ncess? What should be the strategy of those wishing to\nstrengthen international climate policy? Many, if not all,\ncountries in Europe and the developing world remain com-\nmitted to negotiating a global climate deal. They believe\nthat only a universal and comprehensive treaty with firm\ncommitments for emission reductions stands a chance of\naverting the threat posed by global warming. Other coun-\ntries, including major emitters such as the United States,\nremain wary of this approach. They either hold that reach-\ning an agreement on a global treaty is unrealistic or would\nnot wish to be legally bound by such a treaty in any case.\nEither way, they prefer to build elements of global climate\npolicy from the bottom up, by taking action at the domes-\ntic level. Major emerging economies such as China have\nsimilar concerns about sovereignty, but join the G77 bloc\nof developing countries in demanding a legally binding\nframework for mitigation by industrialised nations. Little\nhas thus changed in the way in which the major players in\nclimate politics define their interests.\nIn the light of these conflicting positions, this article\nreviews the options for future international climate policy.\nIt argues that a major reassessment of the current approach\nto building a climate regime is required. This approach,\nwhich we refer to as the \u2018global deal\u2019 strategy, is predicated\non the idea of negotiating a comprehensive, universal and\nlegally binding treaty that prescribes, in a top-down fash-\nion, generally applicable policies based on previously agreed\nprinciples. From a review of the history of the \u2018global deal\u2019\nstrategy from Rio (1992) to Kyoto (1997) and beyond we\nconclude that this approach has been producing diminish-\ning returns for some time, and that it is time to consider\nan alternative path \u2013 if not goal \u2013 for climate policy. The\nalternative that, in our view, is most likely to move the\nworld closer towards a working international climate\nregime is a \u2018building blocks\u2019 approach, which develops\ndifferent elements of climate governance in an incremental\nfashion and embeds them in an international political\nframework.\nThis alternative, as we argue below, is already emergent\nin international politics. The goal of a full treaty has been\nabandoned for the next climate conference in Mexico,\nwhich is instead aiming at a number of partial agreements\n(on finance, forestry, technology transfer, adaptation) under\nthe UNFCCC umbrella. For this to produce results, a\nmore strategic approach is needed to ensure that \u2013 over\ntime \u2013 such partial elements add up to an ambitious and\ninternationally coordinated climate policy, which does not\ndrive down the level of aspiration and commitment.\n1. The rise (and decline) of the \u2018global deal\u2019\nstrategy\nFrom an early stage, international climate diplomacy has\nbeen focused on the creation of a comprehensive treaty\nwith binding commitments on mitigation and adaptation\nfunding. This global deal strategy contains five key ele-\nments:\n\u2022 it prescribes, in a top-down way, generally applicable\npolicies that are based on commonly understood princi-\nples;\n\u2022 it strives to develop targets and instruments of climate\ngovernance (regarding mitigation measures, carbon sinks,\nadaptation efforts) in a comprehensive manner;\n\u2022 it is intended to be universal in its application, applying\nto all countries according to agreed principles of burden\nsharing;\n\u2022 it is universal in its negotiation and decision-making\nprocess, being based on the primacy of the UN frame-\nwork; and\n\u2022 it seeks to establish legally binding international obliga-\ntions.\nThis approach builds on an established model of envi-\nronmental regime building. Since the 1970s, global\nenvironmental issues have been dealt with in a compart-\nmentalised way by negotiating issue-specific treaties and\nInternational Climate Policy\n253\nGlobal Policy (2010) 1:3 Copyright \u0002 2010 London School of Economics and Political Science and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\nbuilding institutions around them (Susskind, 1994). This\nmodel has proved highly successful in creating a growing\nweb of treaty obligations and institutional mechanisms for\naddressing transnational forms of pollution, from marine\npollution to transboundary air pollution and trade in\nendangered species. Over the last four decades, the number\nof multilateral environmental treaties has grown steadily,\nclimbing to well over 500 today.1\nThe international regime to combat the depletion of the\nozone layer is widely regarded as the most successful exam-\nple of a global deal strategy (Parson, 2003). The 1985\nVienna Convention created a framework for international\ncooperation on information exchange, research and moni-\ntoring and established the norm of ozone layer protection.\nThe 1987 Montreal Protocol then set a specific target for\nreducing emissions of ozone-depleting chemicals (50 per\ncent by 1999). The Multilateral Ozone Fund, which was\ncreated in 1990 to support implementation in developing\ncountries, received pledges totalling US$2.55 billion over\nthe period from 1991 to 2009. Subsequent revisions of the\nMontreal Protocol succeeded in bringing forward the emis-\nsion reduction schedule, with nearly all production and use\nof ozone-depleting substances ceasing in most industria-\nlised countries by the late 1990s.\nGiven its success, it should not come as a surprise that\nthe ozone regime served as the main model for climate\ndiplomacy. To be sure, climate change was widely recogni-\nsed to pose a more complex and costlier challenge than\nozone depletion, and early on there was some debate about\na universal approach versus regional or sectoral approaches\n(Nitze, 1990). But by disaggregating the problem and\napplying the convention-plus-protocol approach, negotia-\ntors hoped to repeat the success of the experience with the\nozone regime (Sebenius, 1994, p. 283).\nInitially, the strategy seemed to pay off. The UN Frame-\nwork Convention was successfully negotiated in the run-up\nto the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Devel-\nopment in Rio de Janeiro (Mintzer and Leonard, 1994).\nLargely due to US resistance, the Convention did not\ninclude binding commitments to emission reductions. It\ndid, however, establish the norm of global climate stabilisa-\ntion and the principle of \u2018common but differentiated\nresponsibilities\u2019, which have underpinned international cli-\nmate politics ever since. Moreover, it achieved near univer-\nsal support, with all major industrialised and developing\ncountries ratifying it in subsequent years. In many ways,\nthe UNFCCC resembles the Vienna Convention on ozone\nlayer depletion, in that it inscribed a normative commit-\nment into a legal agreement and paved the way for the\nnegotiation of a more specific protocol with binding com-\nmitments. The latter was achieved in 1997 with the signing\nof the Kyoto Protocol, which included differentiated com-\nmitments by industrialised countries to reduce their green-\nhouse gas emissions by, on average, 5 per cent with 1990\nas the base year.\nThe detailed construction of a climate regime was to\nprove much more difficult and the Kyoto Protocol only\nentered into force in February 2005, after a prolonged\nstruggle to muster a sufficient number of ratifications. The\nKyoto Protocol was also more limited in its scope com-\npared to the Montreal Protocol and its subsequent revi-\nsions. Commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions\nwere of only limited environmental impact and did not\nextend to developing countries; and, critically, the United\nStates failed to ratify the climate deal, thereby undermining\nthe long-term effectiveness and future of the Protocol. Of\ncourse, the 1987 Montreal Protocol on its own would not\nhave sufficed to deal with ozone layer depletion. Only sub-\nsequent treaty revisions brought the production and use of\nozone-depleting substances to a near halt in the late 1990s.\nIn this sense, the Kyoto Protocol served a similar purpose\nas a staging post on the road towards a more inclusive and\ndemanding climate regime. If its mitigation schedule could\nbe strengthened and extended to those emerging emitters\nthat were not bound by the original emission reduction tar-\ngets, then Kyoto would make a meaningful contribution to\nthe long-term goal of climate stabilisation. But what if the\ngoal of agreeing a successor agreement to Kyoto turned out\nto be elusive?\nThe benefits of the global deal strategy\nBefore we turn to the tortuous history of post-Kyoto inter-\nnational climate negotiations, it is worth reviewing briefly\nthe reasons why the \u2018global deal\u2019 strategy has been domi-\nnant in international environmental politics. There are at\nleast four reasons why it remains central to many countries\u2019\ninternational climate policy today.\nFirst, a treaty that contains firm and measurable commit-\nments that are legally binding is likely to be more effective\nin securing lasting emission reductions than a system of vol-\nuntary pledges. In economic analyses of climate stability as\na public good such international commitments are seen as\nessential if the collective action problem of \u2018free-riding\u2019 is to\nbe overcome (Stern, 2007, ch. 21). Even if international law\ncannot override the sovereign right of nations, the ongoing\nlegalisation of international relations has greatly strength-\nened domestic compliance with international obligations.\nOf course, treaties cannot guarantee that states will act on\ntheir commitments. But they can create an environment in\nwhich reporting and review mechanisms enhance transpar-\nency and trust, and where the creation of compliance and\nenforcement mechanisms can increase the incentives for\nstates to comply with their international obligations. The\ngrowth of international environmental law thus reflects a\nmore profound normative change to international society,\none that is \u2018part of a broader shift in international legal\nunderstandings of sovereignty: away from an emphasis on\nthe rights of states and towards a far greater stress on both\nduties and common interests\u2019 (Hurrell, 2007, p. 225).\nRobert Falkner, Hannes Stephan and John Vogler\n254\nCopyright \u0002 2010 London School of Economics and Political Science and John Wiley & Sons Ltd. Global Policy (2010) 1:3\nSecond, multilateral environmental policy focused on cre-\nating comprehensive regimes has contributed to the growth\nof important institutions that support global environmental\ngovernance. The institutions range from systems of gener-\nating, assessing and disseminating scientific information to\nnational reporting instruments and mechanisms for capacity\nbuilding and financial aid. Where they are based on legal\ncommitments and universal application, such institutions\nnot only support the objectives of specific environmental\ntreaties but become an important feature of overall environ-\nmental governance. They foster learning effects among\nstates, with regard to the understanding of global environ-\nmental problems and the choice of effective policy instru-\nments (Haas et al., 1993; Vogler, 2005).\nThird, the firm commitments that states enter into as\npart of a legally binding global deal send strong signals to\nprivate actors in the global economy, enabling them to\nreduce transaction costs. In contrast to voluntary pledges in\na highly fragmented global governance system, a compre-\nhensive treaty-based regime increases the credibility of pub-\nlic undertakings to reduce pollution. This in turn can\nstimulate a more determined effort by the private sector to\ndeal proactively with environmental problems early on.\nSuch signalling is particularly important for long-term\ninvestment decisions by the corporate sector in environ-\nmentally friendly technologies and processes (Engau and\nHoffmann, 2009).\nFourth, even if international agreement on a global deal\nremains elusive, the continuous push for such an outcome\nhelps to maintain political momentum in international\nnegotiations. Environmental leaders routinely put ambi-\ntious targets and time frames on the international agenda\nto set a high level of expectations and mobilise support for\ninternational solutions. The very fact of an ongoing negoti-\nation process creates its own dynamics and can contribute\nto a more collaborative spirit among participants. As\nDepledge and Yamin (2009, p. 439) point out, \u2018[t]he nego-\ntiating environment of a regime enmeshes delegations in a\ndense web of meetings, practices, processes, and rules, gen-\nerating an inherent motivation among negotiators to\nadvance the issue\u2019. This logic of institutional bargaining is\nevident in the two-decade-long history of climate negotia-\ntions. At various points, negotiators were able to renew\nmomentum for an international climate deal despite set-\nbacks such as the US withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol\nin 2001.\nIn some sense, therefore, Copenhagen can be seen to\nrepresent just another hold-up on the long road towards\nthe final goal, a comprehensive international treaty on cli-\nmate mitigation and adaptation. But as we argue in this\narticle, the Copenhagen conference revealed not only the\nlack of willingness among key actors to commit to a legally\nbinding climate treaty; it also demonstrated that the \u2018global\ndeal\u2019 strategy may have passed the point of diminishing\nreturns. How has it come to this?\nFrom Kyoto to Copenhagen: a road to nowhere?\nThe Kyoto Protocol epitomises both the success of the glo-\nbal deal strategy and its shortcomings. On the one hand, it\nwas the first climate agreement that laid down quantitative\ntargets for emission reductions. These are to be achieved\nover the first commitment period of 2008\u201312, by which\ntime a new and more comprehensive treaty is meant to\nsucceed Kyoto. The Kyoto Protocol introduced innovative\ninstruments for achieving its overall target in a cost-effec-\ntive manner, such as the flexibility of a five-year commit-\nment period based on a mixed basket of six greenhouse\ngases, emissions trading, the Clean Development Mecha-\nnism and Joint Implementation. The Kyoto Protocol thus\nscores highly in terms of some of its political achievements.\nThe very fact that it was adopted in the face of strong\nresistance from powerful states and influential business\ninterests is in itself a sign of the success of the \u2018global deal\u2019\nstrategy.\nOn the other hand, in order for the Kyoto Protocol to\nbe adopted, a number of compromises had to be built into\nthe agreement that severely curtailed its environmental\neffectiveness (Helm, 2009; Victor, 2001). First, Kyoto\nexempted all developing countries from mandatory emis-\nsion reduction targets. This, of course, reflected the\nUNFCCC\u2019s principle of \u2018common but differentiated\nresponsibilities and respective capabilities\u2019. But by creating\na sharp dividing line between Annex I countries and non-\nAnnex I countries, the question of how to include the rap-\nidly emerging emitters from the developing world in future\nmitigation efforts was left unresolved. It was to resurface as\na critical stumbling block in the run-up to the 2009\nCopenhagen conference.\nSecond, and related to the first point, the United States\nnever ratified the Protocol, not least due to the US Senate\u2019s\ninsistence that emerging economies also undertake manda-\ntory emission reductions. America\u2019s 2001 denunciation of\nits signature of the Protocol dealt it a critical, if not fatal,\nblow. It removed the then largest greenhouse gas emitter\nfrom the regime\u2019s core mitigation effort, thus reducing its\nenvironmental impact even further; it placed an even hea-\nvier political and economic burden on the other industria-\nlised countries that sought to make the agreement work\nwithout US participation; and it cast a shadow over any\nfuture effort to negotiate a post-Kyoto climate treaty.\nRe-engaging the US thus became an imperative for reviv-\ning the global deal strategy.\nThird, the Kyoto Protocol suffered from several short-\ncomings in its regime design, including the short-term nat-\nure of its emission targets, the ability of countries to\nwithdraw from the agreement and a weak compliance\nmechanism. These design faults reduced the incentives of\nAnnex I countries to invest in mitigation efforts and\nundermined the willingness of non-Annex I countries to\njoin the agreement at some future point. As Barrett (2003,\nInternational Climate Policy\n255\nGlobal Policy (2010) 1:3 Copyright \u0002 2010 London School of Economics and Political Science and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\n374) argues, Kyoto \u2018doesn\u2019t provide a structure for both\nbroadening and deepening cooperation over time\u2019.\nDespite these shortcomings, the European Union and\nother proactive players in climate politics have pressed on\nwith implementing the agreement after its entry into force.\nIn 2005, the EU created the world\u2019s first regional emissions\ntrading system to help its member states meet the Kyoto\ntargets. It also invested considerable political energy into\nthe international process in an effort to secure a post-Kyoto\nglobal deal (Vogler and Bretherton, 2006). Europe\u2019s persis-\ntence in pursuing this objective played a key role in the\nadoption in 2007 of the Bali Road Map, which laid the\nfoundations for the negotiation of a successor agreement to\nthe Kyoto Protocol (Cle\u00b4menc\u00b8on, 2008). The Copenhagen\nconference in December 2009 was meant to deliver the\npolitical compromise for a new international climate regime\nthat would include commitments by all major emitters.\nYet, despite the apparent success of the global deal strategy\nin sustaining political momentum, the conference failed to\ndeliver the desired result.\nCopenhagen not only disappointed those hoping for a\ndiplomatic breakthrough; it also laid bare the deep fissures\nin climate politics that make a global deal ever less likely.\nThe parties to the UN Framework Convention engaged in\ntough bargaining over nearly every aspect of the proposed\nrules for mitigating climate change. Rather than promote a\nglobal solution in the interest of climate protection, the\nmajor powers focused narrowly on securing their own\nnational interest and avoiding costly commitments to emis-\nsion reductions or long-term funding for adaptation.\nWhether or not Copenhagen signalled the transformation\nof climate politics into plain realpolitik will be debated for\nyears to come (see Bodansky, 2010; Hamilton, 2009).\nWhat is important for our context is that the UN confer-\nence brought into sharper focus the underlying shifts that\nhave occurred in climate politics and that, in our view,\nsignal the end of the global deal strategy.\n2. The growing obstacles to a global climate\ndeal\nIt is a truism in international relations that long-term\ninternational environmental cooperation needs willing part-\nners. Force and coercion are widely regarded as weak if not\nirrelevant instruments for promoting cooperative behaviour\nby states (Falkner, 2005; Young, 1994, p. 136), even if eco-\nnomic clout can in some cases be used to threaten sanctions\nagainst or offer inducements to reluctant players (DeSom-\nbre, 2001). The lack of political will among major emitters\nmust therefore count as one of the key obstacles to reach-\ning a global climate deal. Of course, this is not a new phe-\nnomenon and has plagued international climate politics\never since the UNFCCC was adopted in 1992. But against\nthe background of a recent surge in worldwide support for\nclimate action, the continued reluctance of major players to\nmove beyond informal pledges and voluntary measures has\nbecome the major hurdle on the way to a global deal.\nThere are several reasons why it has proved so difficult\nto overcome this obstacle. The first is that some major\nemitters lack the necessary domestic support or have yet to\ncreate domestic policies as the basis for meaningful interna-\ntional commitments. Indeed, of the five leading emitters\nthat account for two-thirds of global CO2 gas emissions \u2013\nChina, the United States, the European Union, Russia and\nIndia \u2013 only the EU has offered strong support for a bind-\ning climate treaty and has backed this up with domestic\nlegislation. Collectively, these five major players hold the\nkey to success in international climate politics. If all or\nsome of these five emitters refuse to commit to interna-\ntional emission reductions, the chances of reaching a\ncomprehensive and meaningful global deal are low.\nOut of those five, the US has been, and remains, the\npivotal player. The US has contributed most to global\nwarming in cumulative terms, if all historical emissions are\ntaken into account. As the world\u2019s pre-eminent state, lead-\ning economy and unrivalled military power, it bears a spe-\ncial responsibility for the state of international climate\npolicy. To date, the US has repeatedly held back interna-\ntional efforts, despite agreeing to the UNFCCC (which it\nratified) and the Kyoto Protocol (which it failed to ratify).\nFor much of the last 15 years, and especially under the\npresidency of George W. Bush, the US has dragged its\nfeet in negotiations and rejected any mandatory emission\nreductions.\nThe US may have re-engaged in climate diplomacy\nunder President Obama, but lack of domestic support for\nan international treaty continues to hold back a more pro-\nactive international role (Falkner, 2010). Recent attempts\nto steer a domestic climate bill through a Democrat-con-\ntrolled Congress have faltered, and the chances of a federal\ncap-and-trade system being introduced in the near future\nare rapidly diminishing as the political pendulum swings\nback towards the Republicans. More importantly for a \u2018glo-\nbal deal\u2019 strategy, the US Senate has repeatedly stipulated\nthat emerging economies must shoulder comparable com-\nmitments to mitigate their rising emissions in order for the\nUS to ratify a future climate treaty. Having rejected the\nKyoto Protocol and avoided domestic measures to limit\nemissions in the past, the US now faces even tougher\ndomestic adjustment costs should it ever wish to accede to\na binding international climate regime.\nWhile the US makes its own willingness to consider an\ninternational climate deal dependent on commitments by\nmajor emerging economies, China itself remains steadfastly\nopposed to a mandatory mitigation regime unless the US\ntakes a lead in controlling emissions. Just like other emerg-\ning economies and developing countries, China insists that\nindustrialised countries bear a greater historical responsibil-\nity for global warming and that poorer countries need to\ncatch up economically before a heavy mitigation burden is\nRobert Falkner, Hannes Stephan and John Vogler\n256\nCopyright \u0002 2010 London School of Economics and Political Science and John Wiley & Sons Ltd. Global Policy (2010) 1:3\nplaced on their shoulders. The two largest emitters are thus\nlocked into a \u2018game of chicken\u2019, in which neither side is\nwilling to make the first significant concession.2 For other\ncountries, the US\u2013Chinese relationship creates a profound\npolitical conundrum: unable to change the US or Chinese\nposition, the push for a global deal is likely to fall at the\nfirst hurdle.\nOf course, the US and China are not the only veto play-\ners. Russia, which helped the Kyoto Protocol to enter into\nforce by ratifying it in 2004, has since kept a low profile in\nclimate politics, playing only a marginal role at Copenha-\ngen. India, on the other hand, has taken on an increasingly\nassertive role in international talks. Traditionally sceptical\nof demands for developing countries to contribute to the\nmitigation effort, it has put forward a robust defence of the\nKyoto Protocol\u2019s sharp distinction between Annex I coun-\ntries and non-Annex I countries. In the run-up to Copen-\nhagen, the Indian leadership repeatedly stressed that it was\nunwilling to accept binding mitigation targets, echoing\nG77 statements against the injustice of shifting the climate\nmitigation burden to poorer nations. Both India and China\nare cognisant of the increasing attention that will be paid\nto their expanding carbon footprint as their economies con-\ntinue on their current growth path. But they fear that they\ncannot achieve their long-term development objectives\nif they take on binding mitigation targets as part of an\ninternational agreement. Even weak intensity targets and\nnational policy approaches are viewed with suspicion in\ncase they lead down a slippery slope towards firm reduction\ntargets.\nStructural shifts in the international political economy\nhave, if anything, complicated the search for a global deal\nby strengthening the veto power of certain laggard coun-\ntries. Whereas during the 1990s the gap between European\nand American climate policy defined the main fault line in\nclimate politics, more recently the divisions between devel-\noped and emerging economies have moved centre stage.\nThis shift manifests itself in climate politics in two princi-\npal ways: in the growing share of emerging economies in\nworldwide emissions; and in the demands that these\ncountries are making for enhanced representation and\ninfluence within the established framework of international\ncooperation.\nThe changing distribution of global emissions is rooted\nin the shift in economic activity and power to emerging\neconomies, particularly in Asia. In 2007, China surpassed\nthe United States as the world\u2019s largest CO2 gas emitter.\n3\nThe country\u2019s contribution to the global enhanced green-\nhouse effect is difficult to measure precisely, but all esti-\nmates point in the same direction, namely dramatically\nrising energy consumption and emission levels for the next\nfew decades. Business-as-usual forecasts suggest that the\ncountry\u2019s energy-related CO2 emissions alone will make up\nmore than a quarter of worldwide emissions by 2030. The\nUS Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates\nthat China\u2019s energy-related CO2 emissions will rise from\n2.24 gigatonnes (Gt) in 1990 to 5.32 Gt in 2005 and\n12.01 Gt in 2030. World emissions are estimated to climb\nto 42.3 Gt in 2030.4 Overall, non-Annex I countries have\nincreased their share of global emissions from 33.1 per cent\nin 1990 to 48.3 per cent in 2006. Their share is expected\nto rise to 58.5 per cent by 2025.5\nAgainst the background of a global economic transfor-\nmation, the United States and China increasingly view\nworld politics through the lens of their bilateral relation-\nship. As the two largest emitters worldwide, with a com-\nbined share of global greenhouse gas emissions of 41.8 per\ncent in 2006,6 the two countries are fully aware of their\ncentral role in determining the future of climate policy. A\nde facto G2 formation between the US and China, which\nhas already emerged in other areas of global economic\nrelations such as finance, is beginning to play a more\nimportant role in climate politics as well (Garrett, 2010, p.\n29). Moreover, with other emerging economies flexing\ntheir muscles and asserting their national interests, the\ndynamics of climate negotiations have begun to change.\nThe emergence of the BASIC group in climate negotia-\ntions \u2013 assembling Brazil, South Africa, India and China \u2013\nis the clearest sign yet of how global economic change has\nbeen translated into a new international political structure.\nOne of the first casualties of this alteration was the\nEuropean Union\u2019s ambition to play a leadership role. As is\nwidely recognised, the Kyoto Protocol would not have\ncome into force had the EU not provided leadership in\nthe 1997 negotiations and in the struggle to secure its\nentry into force in 2005. Europe\u2019s emissions trading sys-\ntem provides a model for international emissions trading\nunder the climate treaty and remains the world\u2019s pre-\neminent experiment in reducing greenhouse gas emissions\nthrough a flexible market-based instrument. The EU\nexpected to play a leading role again in Copenhagen,\nhaving committed to comparatively demanding emission\nreduction targets and having offered substantial financial\naid to developing countries. By leading the debate on\ninternational climate policy and pioneering innovative\nmechanisms, the EU hoped to encourage tangible conces-\nsions by other players.\nYet, as soon as the gavel came down at the closing\nCOP-15 plenary in the early afternoon of Saturday 19\nDecember, the realisation sank in among European negoti-\nators that the EU had not played a leading role in the final\nphase of the Copenhagen conference. While a \u2018Friends of\nthe Chair\u2019 grouping of 27 countries, including the EU and\nits most important member states, was drafting the Copen-\nhagen Accord, it was the US president who brokered the\nfinal compromise with the BASIC countries in a separate\nmeeting without European input. Having argued for a\ncomprehensive deal in the run-up to the conference, Euro-\npean leaders were left with little choice but to endorse the\nwatered-down version of the Accord.\nInternational Climate Policy\n257\nGlobal Policy (2010) 1:3 Copyright \u0002 2010 London School of Economics and Political Science and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\nThe final stage of the Copenhagen conference also\nbrought to light the shortcomings of the UN negotiation\nframework. Two years had been spent in preparing for the\nconference, a process that had started with the adoption of\nthe Bali Road Map in 2007. At COP-15, negotiators from\nover 190 countries spent a further intensive two weeks\nnegotiating (unsuccessfully) over heavily bracketed texts,\nonly to see a smaller group of heads of government take\nover and draft a compromise agreement that was not based\non the official negotiation texts prepared in the preceding\nCOP working groups. In the end, the COP plenary, the\nofficial UN forum with decision-making authority, failed\nto adopt the leaders\u2019 Copenhagen Accord. It merely took\nnote of it.\nThe negotiations at Copenhagen were painstakingly slow\nand cumbersome, complicated not least by the need to\nagree a package deal that includes all elements of the cli-\nmate regime (emission reductions, timetables, financing,\netc.) and that is acceptable to all countries. As the UN Cli-\nmate Convention approaches universal acceptance with a\ntotal of 194 ratifications as of 2010, it may produce a\nhigh degree of participation and legitimacy but ends up\ndelivering a diminishing rate of return in terms of effective\nbargaining.\nA growing number of observers now argue that UN-style\ndecision making based on the consensus principle has\nbecome an impediment to a post-Kyoto climate regime\n(Hamilton, 2009). This was evident not least in the closing\ndays and hours of the Copenhagen conference when heads\nof government wrestled the initiative from their official\nnegotiators and created a more fluid yet manageable frame-\nwork for striking bargains. The use of smaller and more\nexclusive negotiation groups is a common feature of inter-\nnational environmental negotiations. But as was to be\nexpected, the Copenhagen Accord was criticised by some\nparties for its lack of ambition and legitimacy. It remains\nto be seen whether the new bargaining structure that\nemerged in the final two days of the climate summit\nremains a one-off event or points to the arrival of a new\nform of multi-track diplomacy in climate politics.\n3. The transition towards a \u2018building blocks\u2019\napproach\nIf, as we argue in this article, a \u2018global deal\u2019 strategy yields\nrapidly diminishing returns in the post-Copenhagen era,\nthen the question arises of what alternatives are available to\nclimate negotiators. There is no shortage of proposals on\nhow to advance the goal of climate protection, and the aca-\ndemic and policy debate has produced dozens of more or\nless specific models for international climate policy (for an\noverview, see Aldy and Stavins, 2010; Biermann et al.,\n2009; Kuik et al., 2008). This is not the place to review\nthis debate or assess specific proposals. Instead, we take a\nwider perspective and propose a shift in thinking on how\nto construct the global climate governance architecture.\nOur argument is that construction by \u2018building blocks\u2019 pro-\nvides a more realistic approach to creating a workable glo-\nbal climate regime, even though it is not without its own\nrisks and shortfalls. Some characteristics are shared by both\nthe \u2018global deal\u2019 and \u2018building blocks\u2019 approaches, not least\nthe objective of creating a strong international framework\nfor climate action; but they also differ in important ways,\nprimarily on the question of how to achieve this goal.\nFundamental to a building blocks approach is the recog-\nnition that, given prevailing interests and power structures,\na functioning framework for climate governance is unlikely\nto be constructed all at once, in a top-down fashion. The\napproach reinterprets international climate politics as an\nongoing political process that seeks to create trust between\nnations and build climate governance step by step out of\nseveral regime elements. Although dispensing with the idea\nof creating a comprehensive, legally binding, treaty up\nfront, it remains committed to building an overall interna-\ntional framework for climate action. It is thus closer to the\n\u2018global deal\u2019 strategy than a thoroughly \u2018bottom-up\u2019 model\nof climate governance which relies solely on decentralised\nnational and subnational climate measures. In other words,\na building blocks approach combines the long-term objec-\ntive of a global climate architecture with a dose of political\nrealism in the process of creating this architecture.\nA number of variants of this strategy have been devel-\noped in recent years. One such version seeks to advance cli-\nmate stability by disaggregating global climate governance\ninto component parts that can be developed in a more flex-\nible manner, involving different sets of negotiations based\non varying political geometries and regime types. Heller\n(2008), for example, proposes the \u2018pillarisation\u2019 of climate\npolicy as a way of developing parallel agreements on\nspecific, functionally defined, issues. Rather than wait for a\nsingle agreement to cover all governance mechanisms, indi-\nvidual agreements are developed on matters such as tech-\nnology innovation and diffusion, adaptation funding,\ndeforestation and sectoral approaches for industrial sectors.\nTo some extent, pillarisation overlaps with what advo-\ncates of a bottom-up model of climate governance propose\n(Hulme, 2010; Prins et al., 2010). Critics of the UN pro-\ncess imagine these elements of global climate governance as\nself-standing, decentralised initiatives. Instead of investing\npolitical energies in a drawn-out and cumbersome interna-\ntional negotiation process, countries focus on what can be\ndone here and now, at the national level. Rather than forc-\ning economic change towards a low-carbon future through\ntop-down regulation, they seek to bring about such change\nthrough promoting energy efficiency, introducing alterna-\ntive energy sources and inducing technological break-\nthroughs throughout the economy (Nordhaus and\nShellenberger, 2010). The 2005 Asia-Pacific Partnership\non Clean Development and Climate is one such example\nof a coalition of countries that engages in a range of\nRobert Falkner, Hannes Stephan and John Vogler\n258\nCopyright \u0002 2010 London School of Economics and Political Science and John Wiley & Sons Ltd. Global Policy (2010) 1:3\nbottom-up initiatives loosely grouped around the themes of\nenergy security, air pollution reduction and climate change.\nYet, by abandoning all efforts to create an international\nclimate regime, the bottom-up approach removes a major\nstimulus for developing more ambitious domestic policies,\nthus solidifying the lowest common denominator. It turns\nclimate change from a political into a technological chal-\nlenge and eschews the difficult distributive conflicts that\nare central to international climate politics. A building\nblocks approach would recognise that domestic policies\nneed to be embedded in a broader international effort,\nwithin the UNFCCC or through an affiliated negotiating\nprocess.\nIn fact, this dual approach of advancing domestic and\ninternational policies is already evident in the pre- and\npost-Copenhagen process. Significant advances were made\nat Copenhagen in most of the areas listed above and some\nof them may be ready for official agreement in Cancun in\nDecember 2010. For instance, with regard to the planned\ninstrument for avoiding deforestation (UN-REDD), the\n\u2018Paris-Oslo\u2019 process has brought together around 60 indus-\ntrialised and developing countries to drive the implementa-\ntion of comparable REDD+ measures over the next three\nyears. Its financial clout ($6 billion pledged so far) and the\nexperiences gained from project design and management\nwill undoubtedly speed up the forest-related negotiations\nunder the UNFCCC.\nBesides advancing such \u2018functional\u2019 issue areas \u2013 includ-\ning deforestation, adaptation and technology transfer \u2013\nwhich already benefit from a certain degree of political\nagreement, a building blocks model can also be applied to\ncore regime areas such as climate mitigation through tar-\ngets, timetables and \u2018sustainable development policies and\nmeasures\u2019 (SD-PAMs). A promising strategy would thus\nrely on resolving easier problems (\u2018low-hanging fruit\u2019)\nthrough flexible deals and addressing more complex issues\nat a later stage. The Copenhagen Accord already reflects\nthis approach through its \u2018pledge-and-review\u2019 list of volun-\ntary commitments from a large number of countries. While\nindustrialised nations have put forward specific mitigation\ntargets, developing countries have made measurable com-\nmitments on energy intensity and other \u2018nationally appro-\npriate mitigation actions\u2019 (NAMAs) which do not involve\ncostly measures that could stifle economic growth.\nGiven that the Accord still represents a lowest common\ndenominator agreement with questionable long-term effec-\ntiveness, a building blocks approach would need leading\ncountries to \u2018raise the bar\u2019 and push for partial agreements\nwith a select group of parties. For example, Bodansky and\nDiringer (2007) have made the case for a \u2018menu\u2019 of mitiga-\ntion actions that allows for multiple regulatory tracks and\nattempts to satisfy simultaneously demands for flexibility\n(national conditions and interests) and integration (greater\nreciprocity and coordination). It is also clear that such\nagreements would need to be designed to include appropri-\nate incentive structures so that greater participation can be\nachieved over time.\nWith the present reluctance of the pivotal players, the\nUS and China, to entertain stronger commitments, the\nresponsibility for forging more ambitious coalitions may\nonce again fall to the EU. A growing number of commen-\ntators now suggest that a \u2018coalition of the willing\u2019 should\nheed the calls from the developing world to continue the\nKyoto Protocol beyond 2012 and enter a second commit-\nment period (Grubb, 2010; Tangen, 2010). Besides the\nEU, other candidates for such a coalition include \u2018progres-\nsive\u2019 medium powers such as Mexico, South Korea and\nIndonesia as well as existing parties to the Protocol such as\nJapan and Russia. Gathering enough support for a new\ncommitment period would be far from easy, but it would\ncement the EU\u2019s status as a front-runner in climate gover-\nnance. Moreover, it would provide a boost to embryonic\nregional and national carbon markets and keep alive a more\nambitious regulatory framework which could, later on,\nbecome the core of a comprehensive global settlement.\nCertainly, this selective approach to developing limited\npolicy approaches is and remains a second best alternative\nto an elusive global deal. By embedding such partial agree-\nments in a global political framework, it is hoped that they\nwill ultimately add up to a larger political architecture.\nHow to construct a global agreement that would go beyond\nthe very limited ambition of the Copenhagen Accord\nremains an open question for now. Alternative interna-\ntional forums and settings, such as the G20 and the Major\nEconomies Forum (comprising 17 members), may need to\nbe employed in the search for global compromises between\nthe major players in climate politics (Giddens, 2009).\nThese forums would need to provide the necessary political\nspace to facilitate frank discussions and, potentially, strate-\ngic bargaining between the biggest emitters.\nGiven the need to proceed on various \u2018tracks\u2019, creating a\ncoherent governance architecture out of separate and partial\nagreements remains a key challenge in the building blocks\napproach. Coherence is needed to ensure that climate poli-\ncies reinforce each other rather than trigger competitive\ndynamics (Biermann et al., 2009). It is also of importance\nfor the creation of transparency and trust in governmental\nefforts that are undertaken without a fully comprehensive\nand binding climate regime in place. Moreover, because\nbuilding climate governance will remain an ongoing inter-\nnational process, the partial agreements suggested above\nshould be designed to accommodate future deepening and\nbroadening. The latter could be ensured, for instance, by\ncreating \u2018docking stations\u2019 so that new participants can be\nadded without great difficulty at a later stage (Petsonk,\n2009).\nInternational coherence and coordination will also need\nto be sought with regard to measuring parties\u2019 mitigation\nefforts, through internationally agreed monitoring, report-\ning and verification systems. Progress on this front will also\nInternational Climate Policy\n259\nGlobal Policy (2010) 1:3 Copyright \u0002 2010 London School of Economics and Political Science and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\nplay an important role in scaling up national and regional\nemissions trading systems to the global level. The Copen-\nhagen negotiations have shown measurement and verifica-\ntion to be a highly sensitive political subject, which will\nrequire a great deal of trust building, persuasion and reci-\nprocal action among the major powers.\nAre there any real-world analogies to the building blocks\nmodel of climate governance? Some have likened the\napproach to developments in the trade policy area after\n1945 (Antholis, 2009; Bodansky and Diringer, 2007). To\nbe sure, there are profound differences both in the problem\nstructure and political dynamics of trade and climate\nchange. Most importantly, as Houser (2010, p. 16) reminds\nus, \u2018the climate doesn\u2019t have time for a Doha-like\napproach\u2019. Still, the procedural analogy between the evolu-\ntion of the GATT and a climate building blocks approach\nis instructive. The 1948 General Agreement on Tariffs and\nTrade (GATT) was a partial trade agreement focused\nmainly on reducing tariffs on trade in manufactured goods.\nIt was a second best solution and served as a fallback posi-\ntion after the more comprehensive agreement on the Inter-\nnational Trade Organization (ITO) failed to be ratified by\nthe US. Building on the GATT, the parties gradually\nexpanded the scope of the trade regime in successive trade\nrounds from the 1950s to the 1970s. This process culmi-\nnated in the Uruguay Round, which expanded the trade\nregime to cover new areas such as services and agriculture.\nIt integrated the various trade treaties under the umbrella\nof the newly created World Trade Organization (WTO).\nOver time, membership of the GATT, and later the\nWTO, grew steadily, and the commitments taken on by\nmember states were gradually expanded and deepened.\nThe WTO can thus be seen to have been fabricated out\nof a number of building blocks that allowed countries to\nadjust their expectations and identify common interests in\na process of repeated negotiations. The WTO was the\ncrowning achievement, rather than the starting point, of a\nregime-building process. The trade regime was not meant\nto be created in this manner, but the failure of the ITO\nleft no choice but to pursue a \u2018pluri-lateral\u2019 coalition of the\nwilling. This was helped by the fact that expectations of\ncommercial gains from increasingly comprehensive global\ntrade rules mobilised a variety of domestic and transna-\ntional actors in support of the GATT \u2044WTO. Such gains\nwill be harder to come by in climate politics. Still, those\nwho stand to reap \u2018first-mover advantages\u2019 from stronger\nglobal climate governance \u2013 for instance leading technology\ncorporations or innovative regions such as California \u2013 can\nbe expected to put pressure on national governments. The\nbuilding blocks of climate governance thus need to be\ndesigned to create incentives for those countries still reluc-\ntant to make firm and ambitious commitments. The pros-\npect of a lucrative global carbon market or competitive\nadvantage in a carbon-constrained global economy would\nbecome the critical ingredient for driving forward the pro-\ncess of building a more comprehensive global architecture\n(Keohane and Raustiala, 2010, p. 378).\nConclusions\nGiven the deadlock in current international negotiations,\nwhat should be the strategy of those wishing to strengthen\ninternational climate policy? Our analysis suggests that the\npush for a \u2018global deal\u2019 is producing diminishing returns\nand that parties may need to consider a second best sce-\nnario. This alternative strategy is based on the idea of cre-\nating a climate regime in an incremental fashion, based on\npartial agreements and governance mechanisms. While the\nobjective of a universal and comprehensive treaty with firm\ncommitments for emission reductions remains valid, a\nbuilding blocks approach is needed to realise this objective.\nOur review of the international climate negotiations\nfrom the early 1990s onwards shows that the global deal\nstrategy has been successful in driving the international\nprocess forward and creating political momentum behind\nglobal climate protection. But it has repeatedly come up\nagainst resistance by large emitters and is unlikely to suc-\nceed in bringing future negotiations to a rapid conclusion.\nThe next conference of the parties in Mexico at the end of\n2010 is not expected to produce agreement on a binding\ntreaty. And the Copenhagen Accord points in the direction\nof a different international process, based on multilevel pol-\nicies and initiatives. To some extent, therefore, interna-\ntional climate policy is already being redefined as an\nongoing process that combines parallel efforts to create par-\ntial agreements on building blocks of global climate gover-\nnance.\nSuch a building blocks approach offers some hope of\nbreaking the current stalemate, even though it provides no\nguarantee of success. It would allow for a disaggregation of\nthe negotiations into a proper multitrack approach. This\nwould enable parties to secure \u2018low-hanging fruits\u2019 and\nthereby avoid early and ambitious action in some areas to\nbe held hostage to failure to resolve other areas of conten-\ntion. It would also separate the controversial question of\nthe legal status of any agreement on climate from the need\nto secure a political consensus on a range of mitigation and\nadaptation strategies.\nThere are important drawbacks to such an approach. It\nwould involve a departure from the established principle in\ninternational environmental negotiations that \u2018nothing is\nagreed until everything is agreed\u2019. This principle has pro-\nmoted grand bargains to be struck based on a complex web\nof concessions across a range of issues and countries. The\nbuilding blocks approach would prevent such a grand bar-\ngain and may thus deter parties from making necessary\nconcessions in one area without securing other parties\u2019 con-\ncessions in others. In addition, because buildings blocks do\nnot require universal participation, they may reduce the\nurgency of concerted global cooperation (Biermann et al.,\nRobert Falkner, Hannes Stephan and John Vogler\n260\nCopyright \u0002 2010 London School of Economics and Political Science and John Wiley & Sons Ltd. Global Policy (2010) 1:3\n2009, p. 26). A system of partial agreements and variable\ngeometry may reinforce the logic of free-riding and\nheighten concerns over economic competitiveness.\nThus, the building blocks approach can only be a second\nbest strategy. Whether it will produce the desired results\ndepends on the creation of an international political frame-\nwork, built around the UNFCCC, which ensures that par-\ntial agreements and regime elements are connected and add\nup to a larger climate governance architecture. The Copen-\nhagen Accord may well end up being the foundation for\nsuch a political framework, even if it requires further work.\nThe danger is that moves in the direction of a building\nblocks approach, which are well on the way as parties gear\nup for COP-16 in Mexico, would lead to a disintegration\nof global climate policy. Preventing a collapse into a decen-\ntralised, purely bottom-up, approach is of critical impor-\ntance. A more strategic approach is therefore needed for\nthe building blocks strategy to be successful in the promo-\ntion of ambitious and internationally coordinated climate\npolicy.\nNotes\nThe authors are grateful to the Economic and Social Research Council\n(ESRC) for research funding, Clement Feger for research assistance,\nand Michael Jacobs, Jouni Paavola, Fariborz Zelli, Dimitri Zenghelis\nand members of the BISA Environment Working Group for helpful\ncomments on an earlier version of this article.
