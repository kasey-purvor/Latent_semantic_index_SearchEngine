The properties of such crystalline materials \nsignificantly depend upon the quantity and the type of impurities contained in their \nstructure. The principal objective of this work was to further the understanding of the \nheat transfer mechanisms in the horizontal zone refining process and, by successfully \nmodelling the process, to obtain a correlation between the length of the molten zone and \ntypical operational parameters, for example, the physical dimensions of the process \nequipment, the heating element and the required energy input. Results are presented \nfrom the associated parametric study accomplished through a three-dimensional pseudo-\nsteady state simulation of the zone refining process for Indium Antimonide (InSb). The \nconclusions will be of value when optimising the operating efficiency of horizontal \nzone refining where the length of the molten zone is a significant factor. \n \nIntroduction \nThe general term zone refining denotes a family of methods for controlling the \ndistribution of soluble impurities or solutes in crystalline materials. In such methods a \nshort molten zone travels slowly through a relatively long solid charge and, while \ntraveling, redistributes the solutes in the charge [1]. This is a very important process, \nsince the properties of such crystalline materials depend heavily on the quantity and the \ntype of impurities contained in their structure. In multipass zone refining, a long solid \ningot is set in relative motion with a number of closely placed heating elements, \nproviding the energy input necessary for the redistribution of solutes in the ingot to take \nplace. The advantage of this variation of the zone refining process is mainly the savings \nin the operating time, as succeeding crystallization begins before the preceding one is \ncompleted [1]. \nA number of researchers have investigated methods of improving the efficiency \nof zone refining by optimising parameters such as the length of the molten zone, or the \nnumber of passes [2-5]. Chang et al. [6] focused their research in the coupling of the \nbuoyancy driven heat transfer within a vertical molten zone and the positions of the \ninterfaces relative to the heaters, in poor conductors. Kobayashi [7] also studied the \nrelation between the power required to produce a molten zone and the zone shape. Hoe \nWang et al. [8] developed a two-dimensional pseudo-steady-state model for zone \nmelting recrystallization in which conduction in solid and molten silicon and SiO2, \nconvection in molten silicon and radiation are included. Louchev [9] examined the \ninfluence of natural convection on the formation of a molten zone under optical heating. \nThe objective of this work was to develop a complete model for the heat transfer \nprocesses in the multi-pass horizontal zone refining of a semiconducting material, using \na commercial computational fluid dynamics package, FLUENT ver.6.1 [10]. \nConsidering that the length of the molten zone is one of the most important factors \nwhen optimising the purification method, reaching a correlation relating the energy \ninput to the material and the length of the molten zone created, for different specified \ndimensions of the equipment, is expected to be of significant importance for the \nefficient operation and optimisation of the process equipment. Also, the influence of the \ninclination of the equipment, on the heat transfer aspect of the process, was examined. \n \nDescription of the equipment \nThe multi-pass zone refining process equipment studied is illustrated in Figures \n1 and 2. The semiconducting material, in this case Indium Antimonide (InSb), is placed \ninside a closed Quartz (SiO2) tube. Six heating elements are equally distributed along \nthe length of the tube with a spacing of approximately 150 mm. The tube is 1480 mm \nlong with a diameter of 50 mm in the base configuration. In the specified equipment the \nmoving part of the process is the tube. Each heating element is 50 mm wide constructed \nfrom a spiral coil within a ceramic block. The tube is inclined at approximately 6 \ndegrees to increase the efficiency of the purification process. For anticorrosion purposes \nthe remaining volume of the tube is filled with Hydrogen. The level of the \nsemiconducting material enclosed is approximately 15 mm.  \n \n \n \n \n \nMethodology \nSimulations were accomplished in three stages of increasing complexity. In the \npreliminary stage, a simplified three-dimensional, pseudo-steady state case, modelling \nonly the heat transfer within the semiconducting material was carried out, i.e. \nconduction only. During this stage radiative transfer from the free surface of the charge, \nnatural convection within the atmosphere of quartz tube and the inclination of the tube, \nwere ignored. Similar simplified models have been used in previous investigations \nwhen investigating the influence of the length of the molten zone on the process \nefficiency. This model provides a basis against which a more detailed model may be \ncompared. \nThe furnace was assumed to be comprised of  six identical heating zones,  see \nFigure 3, thereby implying  that the ends of the furnace did not significantly effect the \nheat transfer distribution, and that the energy input from each one of the six equally \nspaced heaters was identical. Consequently only a single heating zone, 150mm in \nlength, was modelled, with prescribed adiabatic boundary conditions at either end, see \nFigure 3. Although natural convection was not simulated at this stage, to be consistent \nwith the later simulations, FLUENT V6 [10] was also employed for the conduction \ncalculations. A hexahedral mesh with approximately 34000 elements was  employed to \nrepresent only the semiconductor charge. A non-uniform mesh was utilised to resolve \nthe region neighbouring the heater elements in more detail.  \nIn the second stage, laminar natural convection within the hydrogen atmosphere \nand radiative heat transfer from the heater elements and through the quartz tube were \ntaken into account in the three-dimensional model. As before only a single heater \nelement was modelled with symmetry boundary conditions at either end, and the \ninclination of the tube was ignored.  \nRadiative heat transfer from the heater element was simulated using a surface-\nto-surface model with pre-computed view factors. The model assumed a non-\nparticipating medium, i.e. that absorption, emission and scattering could be neglected, \nand that the surfaces could be assumed to be optically grey and diffuse [10]. \nComputational grids ranging from 100000 to 180000 hexahedral cells were \nemployed to represent both the semiconductor charge and the hydrogen atmosphere, \naccording to the diameter of the tube. Second order accurate interpolation was \nemployed for the convective terms in all simulations with the final mesh densities being \nselected after preliminary assessment of the independence of the results from the \ncomputational grid. Steady state simulations were carried out using the semi-implicit \nsegregated pressure correction solver, assuming that the density of the hydrogen varied \nonly as a function of temperature, [10]. The default convergence criteria within Fluent \nwere disabled and simulations continued until no significant change in the temperature \nfields could be determined between iterations. Typically, solutions were obtained in a \nfew hours on a 2.4GHz Pentium 4 PC running Linux. \nSince the rate of motion of the tube during the zone refining process is relatively \nslow, all the simulations were considered to be pseudo-steady state. As a consequence \nthe change of phase, and hence latent heat effects, and the progression of the molten \nregion was not taken into account. Furthermore the natural convection inside the molten \nzone was assumed to be relatively insignificant in comparison to the incident radiative \nheat flux and only internal conduction within the semiconductor charge was taken into \naccount.  \nThe thermal properties of InSb are detailed in Table 1. In the simulations the \nphase of the mixture was not explicitly tracked, rather  the phase interface was defined \nby an isotherm at the melting point, as predicted by the simulation, and physical \nproperties expressed as a function of temperature. \nThe thermal conductivity of the liquid and solid phases of InSb is significantly \ndifferent. Therefore, for  temperatures below 750 K, i.e. pure solid, the value of the \nsolid InSb was employed, for  temperatures above 875 K, i.e. pure liquid, the value of \nthe liquid InSb was used, between those limits linear interpolation was employed. A less \npronounced difference in the specific heat capacity exists between the liquid and solid \nphases, a constant value equal to that of the solid phase was assumed to apply \neverywhere. \nA parametric investigation was carried out to investigate the effect of the width \nof the heating element and the diameter of the quartz tube on the length of the molten \nzone. Three tube diameters of 50mm, 75mm and 100mm were considered with heater \nwidths from 50mm to 100mm in 10mm increments. In each case the relative proportion \nof the semiconducting material was kept constant. \nIn the final stage, the whole tube, comprising six heaters and a six degree \ninclination was modelled to quantify the previous assumption of modelling only a single \nheater zone. \n \nBoundary conditions \nA uniform heat flux was chosen to represent the radiative heat flux from the \nheating element on the surface of the quartz tube immediately adjacent to the heater \nelement itself, with a width equal to that of the heating element. Given the relatively \nclose spacing between the heater element and the tube, see Figure 2, this was seen to be \nan acceptable approximation. The heat flux was varied as part of the parametric study, \nthe results from which are presented in the following section. \nThe upper and lower surfaces of the quartz tube were assumed to receive \nidentical incident heat fluxes from the enclosing heater element.  The far ends of the \nzone were treated as adiabatic boundaries under the assumption that they were bounded \nby an identically heated region.  \nThe remaining boundaries were modelled with a mixed convective and radiative \nboundary condition. A convective heat transfer coefficient equal to 9.5 W\/m2K was \nspecified over the exterior surfaces, based upon an approximate value for natural \nconvection to a horizontal cylinder. The quartz tube was assumed to have an emissivity \nof 0.5 and the Indium Antimonide an emissivity of 0.55. \nDuring the preliminary stage of the simulations the atmosphere above the \nsemiconductor charge was assumed to be at a constant temperature of 600 K, 200K less \nthan the melting point of the material. The temperature of the exterior ambient air below \nthe bottom-curved surfaces was assumed to be 300 K. The quartz walls of the tube were \nassumed to have a uniform thickness of 2 mm. In the more detailed stages the \ntemperature of the hydrogen atmosphere was predicted and the external ambient \nboundary conditions were applied over the whole of the quartz tube. Full details of the \nsimulation procedure and the results obtained may be found in Roussopolous [11]. \n \nResults and discussion \nThe temperature distribution on the vertical mid-plane, at mid-height within the \nsemiconducting material, was selected for comparative purposes. The length of the \nmolten zone within the Indium Antimonide was estimated from the isotherm at the \nmelting point.  Validation of the predicted molten zone length was achieved by \ncomparison with qualitative measurements obtained by visual inspection of the \noperating equipment [12]. \nA parametric study was carried out, with simulations for varying geometrical \ndimensions of the quartz tube, width of the heaters and energy inputs. The results from \nthe study allowed a correlation to be obtained between the selected parameters and the \nlength of the molten zone in the semiconductor charge. \nFigure 4 presents the temperature distribution for the 50 mm tube and a heating \nelement of 50 mm width, on the mid-plane, at mid-height in the semiconductor charge. \nThese results include the effects of natural convection in the atmosphere and radiative \nheat transfer from the heater elements. The length of the zone containing the molten \nmaterial was estimated from the isotherm at the melting point. As shown in the figure, \nby successively increasing the output of the heater element, a heat input of \napproximately 0.094 kW per heater is needed for the Indium Antimonide to attain its \nmelting point. For convenience the heat input is also presented in a normalized form \nwith respect to the minimum energy input required to reach the melting point. \nThe predicted temperature distribution on the surface of the quartz tube is \nillustrated in Figure 5a and on a vertical plane mid-way through the tube in Figure 5b. \nFrom the isotherms, the shape of the molten zone in the centre of the semiconducting \nmaterial can be readily identified. The predicted shape is consistent with that expected \nwhen the heater elements are in close proximity to the quartz tube. \nFigure 6 illustrates the predicted velocity distribution within the hydrogen \natmosphere on the same vertical plane, mid-way through the tube, with two \nrecirculating cells formed under the heating element. Hydrogen is convected away from \nthe upper heated surface of the quartz tube to the colder surface of the semiconducting \nmaterial. The results are in qualitative agreement with those obtained from previous \nwork on the simulation of natural convection in a rectangular air filled enclosure [11]. \n The sensitivity of the results to the assumed boundary conditions was checked \nby varying both the external heat transfer coefficient and the surface emissivities. A \n20% variation in the assumed values resulted in approximately a 20K variation  in the \ntemperature of the semiconductor charge. As a result any errors in the assumptions were \nassumed to have only a second order effect on the results. \nThe results from the preliminary investigation, where natural convection and \nradiative heat transfer were neglected, are not shown. These were found to significantly \nunder predict the required heat input (for example only 5 kW\/m2 being required rather \nthan 12 kW\/m2 to melt the charge), due to not accounting for radiative loss from the \nsemiconductor charge. Whilst not surprising the conclusion is important whilst selecting \nthermal boundary conditions when modelling the movement of the melt zone interface. \nThe results from the parametric investigation, for three tube diameters of 50mm, \n75mm and 100mm and for varying width of the heating element, from 50 mm up to 90 \nmm, relating the energy input per heating element and the length of the molten zone \ncreated, are summarised in Figure 7. The results indicate a non-linear relationship \nbetween length of molten zone and power input, also scaling non-linearly with the \ndiameter of the quartz tube. Such a non-linear relationship is to be expected when the \nhighly non-linear radiative loss terms are accounted for. \n The results were normalised to a heat input of 12 kW\/m2, equivalent to a total \nenergy input of approximately 0.094 kW per heater element. In this way, a correlation \nbetween the necessary energy input for the onset of melting in the existing equipment, \nbut also in equipment of different geometrical dimensions, with the same proportion of \nsemiconducting material enclosed, can be achieved. For example, from Figure 7, it can \nbe seen that for a zone length of 34 mm to be achieved in a 50mm tube, with a 50mm \nheater element, an energy input of 0.110 kW per heater, 1.17 times the energy necessary \nto initiate melting to is required. If the diameter of the tube is doubled, whilst keeping \nthe same width for the heating element, and for the same zone length to be created, then \n0.432 kW per heater, or 3.93 times the energy input for achieving the same length in the \n50mm tube is required.  \n If a thin molten zone length is desirable, the results shown in Figure 7 suggest \nthat the region where the gradients are greatest, i.e. large tube diameter and small heater \nelement width, should be selected since any small fluctuation in input energy would \nresult in a small fluctuation of  molten zone length. \nIn order to investigate the influence of the end effects and the inclination of the \ntube the a further simulation was carried out for the whole tube, with all six heating \nelements. A single tube diameter of 50mm was investigated and the heater elements \nwere set at 18 kW\/m2 , resulting in an energy input of 0.14 kW per heater. The tube was \ninclined at 6 degrees. Figure 8 presents the temperature distribution along the mid-plane \nof the tube at mid-height of the charge. Whilst there is a visible end effect due to the \nconvective boundary condition now imposed at each end of the tube, the results are \notherwise comparable to those of a simulation for a single element zone. The inclination \nof the tube has no significant effect upon the temperature distribution within the \nsemiconductor charge.  \n \nConclusion \nA thermal analysis of the horizontal zone refining of Indium Antimonide has \nbeen successfully carried out in the form of a parametric study to investigate the effect \nof heater and tube dimensions on molten zone length and energy input. The results \nindicate that more precise control of the molten zone length may be obtained when \noperating at a larger process diameter, but with narrow heating elements. \nThe results from the simulation of the whole process confirmed that a modest  \ninclination of the tube does not affect the zone refining process from the heat transfer \npoint of view. Furthermore, the results confirm that modelling a single heating zone is \nalmost identical to when the whole tube, including the six heating elements, is \nsimulated. \nThese results from this work are expected to be of value in the future \noptimisation of horizontal zone refining, for both existing equipment and the design of \nnew equipment at larger scales. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors are very grateful to P.
