The paper concludes with discussion of the \nappropriate role of government in higher education. \n \n \nThis paper discusses how to pay for teaching at universities.  It does not talk about research.    \n After initial discussion setting the broader context, subsequent sections discuss \nlessons from economic theory, a general strategy for OECD countries that derives from that \ntheory, a major reform in England in 2006 which exemplifies the strategy, and remaining \ntasks in England (and the UK more broadly).  The paper concludes with discussion of the \nappropriate role of government in higher education. \n \nNicholas Barr:  Higher Education in Europe  1 November 2008 \n1 The backdrop \nThe world has changed.  It is still the case \u2013 and I hope always will be \u2013 that higher education \nmatters because knowledge for its own sake is important.  But, in sharp contrast with 50 years \nago, higher education now matters also for national economic performance and for individual \nlife chances.  Technological advance has driven up the demand for skills.  To compete \ninternationally, countries need mass high-quality higher education. \n \n That immediately raises the question of how to pay for it and how to assist quality.  \nCountries typically pursue three goals in higher education:  larger quantity, higher quality, \nand constant or falling public spending.  It is possible to achieve two but only at expense of \nthe third.  Systems can be \n\u2022 Large and tax-financed, but with worries about quality (France, Germany, Italy); \n\u2022 High-quality and tax-financed, but small (the UK till 1989); \n\u2022 Large and good-quality, but fiscally expensive (Scandinavia). \nThere is nothing illogical about the last option, but it is already unsustainable in most \ncountries, where the only realistic way of achieving all three objectives is to supplement \npublic finance with private finance.   \n \n In reflecting on these issues, two further points are noteworthy: \n\u2022 Competitive systems of higher education appear to produce higher quality, at least as \nmeasured by world rankings; \n\u2022 In South Korea the participation rate in tertiary education is 82 per cent; total \nspending on tertiary education is 2.6 per cent of GDP, double the average for the \nEU19 of 1.3 per cent; and private spending on tertiary education in South Korea is \nNicholas Barr:  Higher Education in Europe  2 November 2008 \nsignificantly higher than total (public plus private) spending in any OECD country \nexcept the USA and Canada (OECD 2006, Table B2.1b, all figures for 2003).  \n \nThere is widespread agreement about two core objectives of higher education policy. \n\u2022 Strengthening quality and diversity, both for their own sake and for reasons of \nnational economic performance \n\u2022 Improving access, again for both efficiency and equity reasons.   \n \n2 Lessons from economic theory \nGood policy needs to be compatible with economic theory.  This section therefore seeks \nbriefly to make three central propositions that should underpin reform in advanced \ncountries.2\n \n2.1 Competition is beneficial \nIn most countries, higher education has, in essence, been centrally planned.  The case against \nthis approach is not ideological, but rooted in the economics of information.  The core of the \nargument is that students (in sharp contrast with school children or people with complex \nmedical problems) are well-informed, or potentially well-informed, consumers, and hence \nbetter able than planners to make choices which conform with their interests and those of the \neconomy. Though that proposition is robust for many students, there is an important \nexception:  people from poorer backgrounds might not be fully-informed, with major \nimplications for access, discussed below. \n \nNicholas Barr:  Higher Education in Europe  3 November 2008 \nOn the supply side, central planning, whether or not it was ever desirable, is no longer \nfeasible. Technological change has led to more universities, more students, and much greater \ndiversity of subject matter.  The myth that all universities are the same and should be funded \nequally is no longer credible.  In principle, differential funding could be implemented by an \nall-knowing central planner, but the problem is too complex for complete reliance on that \nmechanism:  mass higher education needs a funding method in which institutions can charge \ndifferential prices to reflect their different costs and objectives. \n \nIn contrast with central planning, a competitive environment creates incentives for \nuniversities to be more responsive to demand from student and employers.  Such competition \nneeds to be supported by an effective system of quality control. \n \n2.2 Graduates should contribute to the cost of their degree \nA second set of lessons concerns cost sharing.  Higher education creates benefits beyond \nthose to the individual \u2013 benefits in terms of growth, the transmission of values, and the \ndevelopment of knowledge for its own sake.  All these justify continuing taxpayer subsidies.  \nHowever, graduates also receive significant private benefits \u2013 in terms of higher earnings, \nmore satisfying jobs and\/or greater enjoyment of leisure \u2013 making it efficient and equitable \nthat they bear some of the costs.  However, they should bear those costs when they can afford \nthem \u2013 as graduates \u2013 not when they are students.  This leads to the third set of lessons. \n \n2.3 Well-designed student loans have core characteristics \nLoans should have income-contingent repayments, that is, repayments calculated as x per \ncent of the borrower\u2019s subsequent earnings, collected alongside income tax.3  The efficiency \nargument for this form of repayment is that borrowing to finance investment in human capital \nNicholas Barr:  Higher Education in Europe  4 November 2008 \n(in contrast with a home loan) offers no physical collateral.  For that reason and others \nborrowers face considerable uncertainty and, in consequence, would borrow an inefficiently \nsmall amount if the only loan on offer had conventional (fixed, monthly) repayments.  \nIncome-contingent repayments, by building in insurance against inability to repay, increase \nefficiency by protecting borrowers from excessive risk.  For the same reason, income-\ncontingent repayments also protect access.  And because repayments are collected alongside \nincome tax, such loans also protect the lender from much of the risk of making an unsecured \nloan.  Note that what is being discussed is not a tax, which goes on forever, but a genuine \nloan, where repayments stop once principal plus interest have been repaid.  Income-\ncontingent repayments have a profound effect that is insufficiently understood. \n \n A second feature of well-designed loans, is that the loan should be large enough to \ncover fees, and ideally also living costs, resolving student poverty and promoting access by \nmaking higher education free at the point of use.   \n \n Thirdly, loans should attract an interest rate broadly equal to the government\u2019s cost of \nborrowing.  Many countries, including the United Kingdom, offer loans at a zero real interest \nrate, that is, there is a blanket interest subsidy.  The high cost and frequent bad targeting  of \ninterest subsidies is shown internationally by Shen and Ziderman (2008).  In a system that has \n(a) income-contingent repayments and (b) forgiveness of any loan that has not been repaid \nafter (say) 25 years, interest subsidies are particularly pernicious. \n\u2022 The subsidy is enormously expensive.  In the UK, close to one-third of all lending to \nstudents never comes back simply because of the interest subsidy.   \n\u2022 Because of the resulting fiscal pressures, loans are too small, harming access.   \n\u2022 The subsidies also crowd out university income, putting quality at risk.   \nNicholas Barr:  Higher Education in Europe  5 November 2008 \n\u2022 Finally, the subsidies are deeply regressive.  They do not help students (graduates \nmake repayments, not students).  They help low-earning graduates only slightly:  \ngraduates with low monthly earnings are protected by income-contingent repayments, \nand those with low lifetime earnings by forgiveness after 25 years.  They do not help \nhigh-earning graduates early in their careers: with income-contingent loans, monthly \nrepayments depend only on earnings;  interest rates only affect the duration of the \nloan.  Thus the major beneficiaries are successful professionals in mid career, whose \nloan repayments are switched off earlier because of the subsidy than would otherwise \nbe the case.  A move to a somewhat higher interest rate would be progressive.4 \n \n2.4 Why not tax finance? \nIt is widely argued that a system of fees and loans will harm access, and hence that higher \neducation should financed from taxation.  Despite its intuitive plausibility, this argument is \nmistaken.  Specifically, tax finance does not achieve the objectives at the start of the paper.5\n Taxpayer finance puts quality at risk.  It was possible to rely on taxation to finance a \nhigh-quality system when the system was small.  But there are limits to taxation, so that with \na mass system, higher education will lose in the political battle to more urgent and politically \nsalient public spending priorities, including nursery and school education, health care, and \nspending on pensions in the face of population ageing.  It is no accident that real funding per \nstudent declined sharply over the years in many countries as student numbers increased.  \nEven if taxpayer finance on a sufficient scale were desirable, it is infeasible. \n Nor does taxpayer finance widen participation.  To any social scientist who is serious \nabout the evidence, one message about participation stands out starkly \u2013 it\u2019s attainment, \nstupid.  In the UK in 2002 (before variable fees), 81 per cent of children from professional \nNicholas Barr:  Higher Education in Europe  6 November 2008 \nbackgrounds went to university; the comparable figure for children from manual backgrounds \nwas 15 per cent6 \u2013 a shameful record.  Yet restricting the sample to young people with good \nhigh-school leaving grades, the figure was roughly 90 per cent for both groups (UK Office \nfor National Statistics (2004, Figure 2.15).  Thus the major driver of participation is not \nwhether or not higher education is \u2018free\u2019, but a person\u2019s attainment in school. \n Finally, taxpayer finance is regressive. University students are disproportionately \nfrom middle-class backgrounds.  If higher education is paid largely or wholly from taxation, \nthe taxes of poorer people pay for the degrees of people whose parents tend to be better off, \nand who will themselves go on to be among the better off. \n \n3  A general strategy \nThese lessons from economic theory suggest a general strategy potentially applicable to all \nOECD countries:  variable fees, well-designed loans, and active measures to promote access.7  \n \n3.1 Variable fees \nStarting with efficiency arguments, universities are financed from a mix of taxation and \ntuition fees.  Each institution sets its fees, which for each student are covered by entitlement \nto a loan.  Fees give institutions more resources to improve quality and, through competition, \nhelp to improve the efficiency with which those resources are used.   \n \nThe argument for competition is rooted in the idea that students in higher education \nare broadly well-informed and that their information can be further improved.  But the \nargument is not for law-of-the jungle competition but for regulated markets, including a \nmaximum level of fees.  There is good reason for a fees cap.  It needs to be high enough to \nNicholas Barr:  Higher Education in Europe  7 November 2008 \nbring in extra resources and to strengthen competition, but low enough to maintain long-term \npolitical support for the funding strategy and to allow institutions less used to competition \ntime to develop the necessary management capacity.  In addition, though universities \ncompete in terms of teaching, some universities are also selling access to the student\u2019s \nnetwork of peers and, in this latter respect, have an element of monopoly power, creating a \nseparate argument for some form of fees cap. \n \nCounterintuitively, variable fees are also fairer than other approaches; why should \nfees at a local institution be the same as one at an internationally renowned university?  \n \n The obvious argument against fees is that they deter students from poor backgrounds. \nThat is true of upfront fees, i.e. fees that have to be paid at the start of each semester, but not \nwhere students go to university free and make a contribution only after they have graduated. \nThis brings us to the second part of the strategy. \n \n3 2  A well-designed loan scheme \nStudent support is through loans with income-contingent repayments.  The loan entitlement \nshould be large enough to cover fees and living costs, and as discussed earlier, should carry \nan interest rate broadly equal to the government\u2019s cost of borrowing. \n \n If loans are large enough to cover fees, the package resembles \u2018free\u2019 higher education \nfinanced through taxation.  Students pay nothing at the time they go to university.  Part of the \ncost is paid through taxation and part through their subsequent income-contingent \nrepayments.  The viewpoint from the Ministry of Finance is somewhat different.  Though \nloans bring in private resources in the longer-term, a loan system, by definition, has up-front \nNicholas Barr:  Higher Education in Europe  8 November 2008 \ncosts because it lends the money first and receives repayments later.  Thus, depending on a \ncountry\u2019s fiscal situation, there can be advantages if students can borrow from private \nsources.  However, private lenders will typically charge a substantial risk premium unless \nthere is a government guarantee;  and if there is a government guarantee, the loans will be \nclassified as public spending.  Potential solutions exist in this highly technical area, but \nrequire considerable care in design.8\n \n3.3 Action to promote access \nAssume that all students are well-informed and with a good school education. In that case, a \ngood income-contingent loan is all that is needed. \n \nHowever, in most countries not all students are well-informed.  In particular, the \ngroup for whom we want to promote access is not well-informed.  More is needed.  Most \npeople argue that what is needed is \u2018free\u2019 higher education, and that tuition fees will harm \naccess.  As noted, however, the evidence points in a different direction \u2013 the main \ndeterminant of participation is attainment in school. \n \n What does this imply for policy that really starts to improve participation?  Exclusion, \nit can be argued, has four roots:  lack of education, lack of information about university, lack \nof aspirations, and lack of money.  A well-designed strategy should address all four. \n \nRaising attainment:  access fails when someone leaves school at 16, usually for \nreasons that started much earlier.  More resources are needed earlier in the system, not least \nbecause of  the growing evidence (Feinstein 2003) that the roots of exclusion lie in early \nNicholas Barr:  Higher Education in Europe  9 November 2008 \nchildhood.  A central element in widening participation is to strengthen pre-university \neducation, from nursery school onwards. \n \nIncreasing information and raising aspirations: this is a woefully neglected area.  A \nseries of policies address both.  Action to inform school children and raise their aspirations is \ncritical.  Relevant activities include mentoring of schoolchildren by university students, visit \ndays, Saturday schools, summer schools, winter schools, and the like.  \n \nMore money: policies include financial support to encourage teenagers to complete \nhigh school and grants and scholarships to cover some or all costs at university.  Both \npolicies could be supported by financial incentives to universities to widen participation, and \nby extra resources to provide additional intellectual support at tertiary institutions for students \nfrom disadvantaged backgrounds.  In designing such policies, however, it is important to be \nclear that these are only palliative actions.  Scholarships, though important, are the tail;  it is \nattainment that is the dog. \n \n4 Reform in England \nEngland has seen a wave of reform over the past ten years. \n4.1 The 1998 reforms \nReform in 1998 introduced income-contingent loans \u2013 the good news.  However, that apart, \nthe system perpetuated all the faults of the previous system (for a detailed critique, see Barr \nand Crawford 1998; Barr 2002): \nNicholas Barr:  Higher Education in Europe  10 November 2008 \n\u2022 Continued central planning in terms of price (i.e. fixed tuition fees set by \ngovernment), quantity (i.e. central determination of student numbers), and quality \n(intrusive quality assurance). \n\u2022 Complexity: the system of finance was so complicated few people understood it.  \nComplexity adds to administrative cost, and is also an impediment to access. \n\u2022 Inadequate student loans:  loans were too small to cover living costs, and there was no \nloan to cover tuition fees. \n\u2022 Loans charged a zero real interest rate, i.e. incorporated a blanket interest subsidy, \nwith all the problems mentioned earlier. \n \n4.2 The 2006 reforms \nThe failings of the old system manifested themselves in a funding crisis that was both \npredictable and predicted. \n\u2018On the lack of resources, the logic is distressingly compelling.  Public spending on \nhigher education will not go up (the budget said so); parental contributions (i.e. \nprivate spending) will not go up (the Secretary of State said so); and loans to students \n(the other potential source of private spending) count in their entirety as public \nspending.  If public spending is unchanged and there is no extra private spending, \nthere is nothing extra for higher education.... [A]s things stand, [the 1998 reforms] do \nnot produce a brass farthing in the short run\u2019 (Barr and Crawford, 1998, p. 78). \n \n The 2004 Higher Education Act was designed to address the inadequacies of the 1998 \nreforms.  Part of the package was variable fees.  But variable fees were politically contentious \nto the point that in the crucial Parliamentary vote in January 2004, the government\u2019s majority \nNicholas Barr:  Higher Education in Europe  11 November 2008 \nwas reduced from 160 to five!  The Act, which took effect in 2006, had the following central \nelements, which broadly match the general strategy set out in the previous section. \n Element 1: financing universities: the previous fixed fee of \u00a31,000 per year, \nirrespective of university or subject was replaced by a variable fee, set by the university, with \na maximum of \u00a33,000 per year.  Thus universities are financed by a mix of taxpayer support \nand variable fees capped at \u00a33,000.  As argued above, variable fees improve efficiency by \nbringing in more resources and, by strengthening competition, improve the effectiveness with \nwhich those extra resources are used.   \n \nVariable fees are also fairer, not least because most students are from better off \nbackgrounds (if I argued for subsidies for champagne to make it more affordable for poorer \npeople I would rightly be shouted down as looking after my own interests under the pretence \nof widening access).  In addition, as noted, it is wrong to require a student at small local \ninstitution to pay the same fee as one at Oxford. \n \n Element 2:  supporting students: students are entitled to a loan with income-\ncontingent repayments.  The loans were enlarged both to cover tuition charges (a missing \nelement in the previous system) and to provide a more realistic amount to cover living costs.  \nAs a political necessity, however, the blanket interest subsidy was retained. \n Element 3: action to widen participation restored tax-financed scholarships for \nstudents from poor backgrounds (which had been abolished in the 1998 reforms) and \nestablished an access regulator to scrutinise each university\u2019s plans to widen participation.  In \naddition, other policies, separate from the 2004 legislation, offer support earlier in the system. \n\u2022 AimHigher encourages young people to think about the benefits of higher education, \nespecially young people from families with no tradition of higher education. \nNicholas Barr:  Higher Education in Europe  12 November 2008 \n\u2022 Education Maintenance Allowances offer income-tested financial support from 16-19 \nto encourage people to stay in school. \n \nMany politicians and many commentators fail to realise how progressive the strategy \nis.  Variable fees introduce higher charges for those who can afford them (note that with \nincome-contingent loans, \u2018can afford\u2019 refers to a person\u2019s earnings as a graduate, not to \nfamily circumstances while a student);  and redistributive policies help poor people to pay \nthose charges.  To an economist, these elements are staggeringly familiar: the first, a price \nincrease, represents a movement along the demand curve. Taken alone, this element would \nharm access.  However (a) the fees are deferred, and (b), there are targeted transfers to groups \nfor whom access is fragile.  This moves their demand curve outward.  Thus the strategy is \ndeeply progressive.  It shifts resources from today\u2019s best-off (who lose some of their fee \nsubsidies) to today\u2019s worst-off  (who receive a grant and benefit from AimHigher and \nEducation Maintenance Allowances) and tomorrow\u2019s worst-off (who, with income-\ncontingent repayments, do not repay their loan in full).  \n \n4.3  Unfinished business  \nA review of these arrangements, required by the 2004 Higher Education Act, is expected to \nbegin in 2009. The review should address three areas, relating to each of the three elements \nabove:  the fees cap, the interest subsidy, and policies to widen participation. \n \nThe fees cap:  the reasons for a fees cap were set out above, and suggest that a fees \ncap has a continuing role.  However, the current level of \u00a33,000 (a political compromise) is \ntoo low.  Almost all English universities charge the full \u00a33,000, which thus approximates a \nflat fee.  A higher cap would bring in additional resources, would strengthen competition, and \nNicholas Barr:  Higher Education in Europe  13 November 2008 \nwould reduce the subsidy to the best off.  How high is a matter of balance.  Access warriors \nshould not unduly perpetuate a mainly middle-class subsidy; market warriors should \nremember what happens when policy overshoots (the very high level of fees in the USA), or \nloses political support (New Zealand). \n \nThe interest subsidy: the aim of the current blanket interest subsidy, widening \nparticipation, is commendable; and with conventional loans repayments the policy can make \nsense \u2013 an interest subsidy for first-time house buyers would help them by reducing monthly \nrepayments.  In contrast, as discussed earlier, where a system has income-contingent \nrepayments and forgiveness after (say) 25  years, interest subsidies do not improve access or \npromote any other desirable objective. \n \n A zero real interest rate is the wrong one;  it is too low.  A commercial rate \u2013 the rate \nof interest on an unsecured individual loan, such as credit cards \u2013 is too high.  The interest \nrate that is efficient and equitable is broadly equal to the government\u2019s cost of borrowing, for \nexample, the rate of interest on government bonds. That is the appropriate interest rate for \ngraduates with a solid earnings record.  However, there should be targeted interest subsidies, \nnotably for people with low earnings. In addition, there is a strong case for phased \nforgiveness of loans for some public service workers, for instance teachers in the state school \nsystem (there have been moves in this direction in England for some subjects) and for nurses \nand perhaps also doctors in the national health service.  Similarly there could be a phased \nwrite-off for each year of caring activity. \n \nPolicies to widen participation: economists, it is said, are obsessed by prices, while \nother social sciences argue that behaviour has more complex and wide-ranging causes.  Thus \nNicholas Barr:  Higher Education in Europe  14 November 2008 \nI am sometimes bemused that it is these latter groups who become obsessed by fees (i.e. \nprice), while an economist like me argues that the real causes of non-participation are more \ncomplex than fees and generally happen much earlier.  As already discussed, policies to \nwiden participation should focus on ages 0-18 much more than on 18 onwards.  Thus \nAimHigher and Education Maintenance Allowances are very much steps in the right \ndirection.  What is needed is more of the same. \n \n5 Conclusion:  What role for government? \nIt is important to be clear that the arguments in this paper are not for free markets but for \nregulated markets.  Nor is anything I have said intended to be an attack on public funding of \nhigher education, which should remain a permanent part of the landscape. \n \nThe proposal is that universities set fees, but subject to a maximum established by \ngovernment.  There is continued taxpayer support for teaching, probably in the form of block \ngrants to universities;  the balance between fees and block grants determines the extent of \ncompetition.  Students apply to the institutions and courses of their choice. \n \nA well-designed system has a continuing important role for government: \n\u2022 To provide taxpayer support for higher education; \n\u2022 To regulate the system, both through a maximum level of fees and by ensuring that \nthere is effective quality assurance (note that the role of government is to make sure \nthat quality assurance happens, not necessarily to deliver the service itself); \n\u2022 To set incentives, e.g. larger subsidies for certain subjects; \n\u2022 To ensure that there is a good loan scheme; and \n\u2022 To adopt and encourage policies to widen participation.  \nNicholas Barr:  Higher Education in Europe  15 November 2008 \n The idea, in sum, is that public funding is supplemented by private funding, but in \nsuch a way that higher education is free to the student \u2013 it is the graduate who makes \nrepayments, but only in a way that is consistent with his or her future earnings. \nNicholas Barr:  Higher Education in Europe  16 November 2008 \n  \nEndnotes \n \n                                                 \n1 Professor of Public Economics, London School of Economics and Political Science, Houghton Street, London \nWC2A 2AE, UK: Tel: +44-20-7955-7482; Fax: +44-20-7955-7546; Email: N.Barr@lse.ac.uk;  \nhttp:\/\/econ.lse.ac.uk\/staff\/nb. \n2 For fuller discussion, see Barr (2004a; 2004b, Ch. 14) \n3 The original argument was set out by Friedman 1955. \n4 The argument in the text is one of simple logic;  for the numbers, see Dearden, Fitzsimons, Goodman and \nKaplan (2008). \n5 For further discussion of moral arguments about charging tuition fees, see Barr 2004a, pp. 266-7. \n6  UK Education and Skills Select Committee 2002, p. 19 \n7 On international experience, see Barr 2004a, pp. 275-79.
