INTRODUCTION\nOver the past decade optical microresonators have attracted\nconsiderable attention in various fields of physics [1]. Mi-\ncroresonators are basic components for single-photon emit-\nters [2], ultralow threshold lasers [3, 4], and solid-state cav-\nity quantum electrodynamics [5\u20137], to name just a few of\nthe possible applications. Deformed dielectric microdisk res-\nonators are of particular interest since they allow for direc-\ntional light emission, an effect that can be understood and op-\ntimized by exploring fundamental principles of ray-wave cor-\nrespondence [8\u201313]. This directionality can be employed to\ndesign microlasers which make best use of the total output in-\ntensity. Whether a carefully designed mode admits substantial\nlasing depends on how its lifetime compares to the lifetimes of\nother modes in the amplification window. This information is\nencoded in the imaginary parts of the resonance frequencies.\nHowever, the associated spectral statistics have been studied\nonly for a few special geometries, such as the circular disk\nwithout and with surface roughness [14, 15], while other in-\nvestigations focused on disordered media [16, 17] and res-\nonators with small openings [18\u201324].\nIn order to address the spectral properties of dielectric mi-\ncrodisk resonators from a broader perspective it is desirable\nto adopt concepts which have been successfully applied to\nother classes of open systems. In particular, the characteri-\nzation of spectral statistics is often based on two ingredients:\n(a) A Weyl law [25], which estimates the number of states\nwithin a given frequency interval, and (b) random-matrix the-\nory (RMT) [26], which addresses the statistical fluctuations\nand correlations of these states. Traditionally both concepts\nhave been applied to systems with small openings, for which\nthe Weyl law is identical to that of the closed counterpart\n(where the number of states is estimated by assigning one state\nper Planck cell in phase space), while RMT can be justified\nbecause modes of the closed system become strongly mixed\non the scale of the typical life time of the quasibound states in\nthe open system.\nA framework how to adapt these concepts to dielectric mi-\ncrodisk resonators, which are relatively more open systems\nallowing for refractive escape along the entire boundary, has\nonly emerged very recently. Due to the short typical lifetime,\nstrong mode mixing is only observed for a reduced number of\nquasibound states. For systems with ballistic escape, where\nthe mode-mixing time scale is given by the Ehrenfest time\n[27\u201330] and the support of the long-living states is the fractal\nrepeller, it has been established that the number of quasibound\nstates that exceed a certain lifetime is given by a fractal Weyl\nlaw [31\u201335]. Based on a generalization of the repeller for\nrefractive escape, the significance of the fractal Weyl law to\ndielectric microdisk systems with small refractive index has\nbeen demonstrated for the stadium geometry in Ref. [36]. In\nthe present work we consider the same geometry and explore\nthe predictive power of RMT, whose extension to dielectric\nmicroresonators was proposed in Ref. [37]. The application of\nthis extension requires to determine two effective parameters\n(a time scale for the internal dynamics and an effective num-\nber of states), which are sensitive to the formation of short liv-\ning resonances (a mechanism also at heart of the fractal Weyl\nlaw [33], as well as the resonance trapping phenomenon [38]).\nWe concentrate on moderately large values of the refractive in-\ndex, for which the short-living resonance states resemble the\nbouncing-ball modes of the closed stadium billiard [39], and\nfind that the numerical lifetime statistics of long-living quasi-\nbound states agree very well with the RMT predictions.\nThe outline of this paper is as follows. The background\nSection II provides a brief introduction into the spectral prop-\nerties of dielectric microdisk resonators and the dynamical\nmodel of Ref. [37]. In Section III we present numerical re-\nsults for complex resonance frequencies in stadium-shaped\nmicroresonators and then analyze the statistics of long-living\nresonances in two steps. First we show that the mean proper-\nties of the resonance frequencies can be characterized in terms\nof the two effective parameters mentioned above. Based on\nthese parameters, we secondly show that fluctuations of the\nlife times are well captured by RMT. The results are summa-\n2rized in the concluding Sec. IV.\nII. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND\nA. Dielectric microdisk resonators\nDielectric microdisk resonators effectively have a 2D ge-\nometry, defined by a region of constant refractive index n\nwhich is embedded into vacuum (where the refractive index is\nunity). The classical dynamics inside such a resonator is sim-\nilar to a billiard, where a point-like particle moves freely in a\ntwo-dimensional domain with elastic reflections at the bound-\nary [40]. Depending on the shape of the boundary a billiard\ncan show a variety of dynamical behaviors ranging from inte-\ngrable to fully chaotic [41]. Light rays in a microdisk behave\nsimilarly as they are totally reflected at the interfaces as long\nas the angle of incidence is larger than the critical angle for\ntotal internal reflection. If, however, the angle of incidence\nis smaller than the critical angle, light can escape refractively\naccording to Snell\u2019s and Fresnel\u2019s laws. Hence, dielectric mi-\ncrodisk resonators are leaking billiards [8, 9, 42].\nThe leakiness of the resonator limits the photon lifetime,\nwhich can be described by associating complex values to the\nresonance frequencies \u03c9. These frequencies can be obtained\nfrom the Helmholtz equation [43]\n\u2212\u22072\u03c8 = n2(x, y)\u03c9\n2\nc2\n\u03c8 , (1)\nwhere c is the speed of light in vacuum. For a piecewise con-\nstant refractive index, this equation holds for both transverse\nmagnetic (TM) and transverse electric (TE) polarization. For\nTM polarization the electric field is perpendicular to the res-\nonator plane with Ez = Re[\u03c8(x, y)e\u2212i\u03c9t], and the wave func-\ntion \u03c8 and its normal derivative \u2202\u22a5\u03c8 are continuous across the\nboundary of the resonator. For TE polarization, \u03c8 represents\nthe z-component Hz of the magnetic field, and the functions\n\u03c8 and n\u22122\u2202\u22a5\u03c8 are continuous across the boundary. For plane\ninterfaces, these boundary conditions yield the Fresnel reflec-\ntion amplitudes\nrTM(p) =\n\u221a\n1\u2212 p2 \u2212\n\u221a\nn\u22122 \u2212 p2\u221a\n1\u2212 p2 +\n\u221a\nn\u22122 \u2212 p2 , (2a)\nrTE(p) =\n\u221a\n1\u2212 p2 \u2212 n\n\u221a\n1\u2212 n2p2\u221a\n1\u2212 p2 + n\n\u221a\n1\u2212 n2p2 (2b)\nfor resonator photons with dimensionless transverse momen-\ntum p = sin\u03c7, where \u03c7 is the angle of incidence.\nAt infinity, outgoing wave conditions are imposed which\nresults in quasi-bound states with frequencies \u03c9 situated in the\nlower half of the complex plane. Whereas the real part is the\nusual frequency, the imaginary part is related to the lifetime\n\u03c4 = \u22121\/[2 Im\u03c9]. The quality factor of a quasi-bound state is\ndefined by Q = \u2212Re\u03c9\/[2 Im\u03c9].\nAn alternative method to obtain the quasibound states sets\nout with the scattering matrix S, which relates the amplitudes\nof the incoming wave components to the amplitudes of the\noutgoing wave components (see, e.g., Refs. [18, 19, 21\u201323]).\nAt real frequencies, the scattering matrix is unitary. The con-\ndition of a quasibound state corresponds to the situation where\noutgoing wave components are admitted in absence of any in-\ncoming radiation. Under these conditions the scattering ma-\ntrix diverges. The resonance frequencies therefore correspond\nto the poles of the scattering matrix in the complex frequency\nplane.\nB. Dynamical model of microresonators\nRandom-matrix theory delivers a statistical description of\ncomplex quantum systems on the basis of just a few system\nparameters. In particular, a classification according to fun-\ndamental symmetries such as time-reversal symmetry or spin-\nrotation symmetry allows to identify ten classes, among which\nthree are the traditional Wigner-Dyson classes [26], while a\nfurther seven classes apply to systems with chiral or particle-\nhole symmetries [44]. For each symmetry class one can con-\nsider two basis variants of RMT, which either concerns her-\nmitian matrices H (representing the Hamiltonian) or unitary\nmatrices U (representing the scattering matrix or the time evo-\nlution operator). In the absence of magneto-optical effects\nphotonic systems are represented by the orthogonal symmetry\nclass, in which the hermitian and unitary matrices are sym-\nmetric under transposition (H = HT , U = UT ).\nTraditional random-matrix theory does not assume any fur-\nther knowledge of the system, which leads to a uniquely de-\nfined invariant probability measure (the Haar measure). Phys-\nical systems, however, often contain additional commonali-\nties. Dielectric microresonators are a good example, since the\nescape is governed by well structured Fresnel laws of reflec-\ntion and refraction. These laws not only affect the far-field\nradiation characteristics, but also determine the confinement,\nand therefore impact on the spectral properties. It is therefore\ndesirable to incorporate the specific confinement characteris-\ntics of dielectric microresonators into RMT. In order to study\nspectral statistics, one furthermore needs to accommodate fre-\nquency correlations associated to the internal dynamics in the\nresonator. Both requirements are met by a variant of RMT\nrecently proposed in Ref. [37]. In this model the scattering\nmatrix takes the form\nS = \u2212R+ T U [exp(\u2212i\u03c9\u03c4)\u2212RU ]\u22121T , (3a)\nwhere the diagonal matrices\nRlm = \u03b4lmr(pl), Tlm = \u03b4lm\n\u221a\n1\u2212 |r(pl)|2 (3b)\nare determined from the Fresnel reflection amplitudes (2) at\ndiscrete impact parameter pl = (2l \u2212 M \u2212 1)\/M (with\nM= dim S and l = 1, . . . ,M ) [45]. The frequency depen-\ndence is characterized by a time scale \u03c4 which represents\nthe typical time of flight through the resonator. The M -\ndimensional matrixU can be interpreted as a unitary time evo-\nlution operator which propagates photons between encounters\nwith the interface.\n3R\n2L\nrefractive index = n\nrefractive index = 1\nFIG. 1: Sketch of a stadium-shaped dielectric microresonator with\nL = R.\nIn the dynamical model (3), the poles of the scattering ma-\ntrix are determined by the eigenvalue equation\nRU\u03c8 = exp(\u2212i\u03b8)\u03c8, (4)\nwhere \u03b8 = \u03c9\u03c4 is a dimensionless quantity. The operator on\nthe left is subunitary, and therefore each resonance frequency\nin general possesses a negative imaginary part related to the\nlifetime of the state. Eigenvalue problems of this type with\nvarious specifications of R have recently attracted consider-\nable attention [33\u201335, 46\u201349], with main focus on systems\nwith small or ballistic openings (as represented by quantum\ndots with quantum point contacts).\nIn the RMT version of the dynamical model (3), U is taken\nfrom the circular orthogonal ensembles. The statistical de-\nscription is then completed by the specification of the two pa-\nrametersM and \u03c4 . Once these parameters are determined, one\ncan investigate statistical fluctuations. We now implement this\nstrategy for a specific model system.\nIII. LIFE TIME STATISTICS IN THE STADIUM\nMICRORESONATOR\nA microdisk resonator with stadium-shaped cross-section\nis illustrated in Fig. 1. The region with refractive index n is\nbounded by two semicircles with radius R and two straight\nlines of length L. The corresponding closed cavity, the sta-\ndium billiard, is a paradigm for fully developed chaos [50, 51].\nWe consider the case L = R, for which the closed classical\nbilliard has the largest Lyapunov exponent [52].\nThe open stadium resonator has been studied both theoreti-\ncally and experimentally in a number of works, with focus on\nthe spatial mode structure and ray-wave correspondence [53\u2013\n57]. In a first step towards the characterization of the reso-\nnance frequency spectrum of the stadium resonator, the appli-\ncability of the Weyl law has been investigated in Ref. [36].\nWe start our statistical analysis of the spectral fluctuations\nwith the numerical determination the resonance frequencies.\nIn the next step, we relate the averages of the real and imag-\ninary parts of these frequencies to the two parameters \u03c4 and\nM of the dynamical model (3). This fixes the RMT version\nof this model and delivers a prediction for the distribution of\nlife times, which we compare in the final step to the actual life\ntime statistics of the stadium resonator.\nA. Resonance frequencies\nThe resonance states in the stadium billiard can be classi-\nfied by their parity with respect to the horizontal and vertical\nsymmetry lines of the stadium billiard. In the computations\nthis can be exploited by considering four desymmetrized ver-\nsions of the resonator, which differ by the boundary conditions\nimposed on the two symmetry lines (Dirichlet or Neumann\nboundary conditions for states of odd or even parity with re-\nspect to the given symmetry line, respectively). As explained\nin detail in Ref. [36] the boundary element method [58] and\nthe harmonic inversion technique [59] are very efficient tools\nto compute the quasibound states. The combination of these\ntwo methods allows us to gather a large number of resonant\nfrequencies \u03c9, as is required for a reliable statistical analysis.\nA dimensionless form of these frequencies can be obtained\nby considering the scaled frequencies \u2126 = \u03c9R\/c. For the\npresent study we collected resonance frequencies in the inter-\nval 66 < nRe\u2126 < 82.5 for both polarizations (TM and TE),\nall parities, and two different values of the refractive index,\nn = 3.3 (for GaAs) and n = 5. The latter value we have cho-\nsen since a broad interval of refractive indices allows a more\nconvincing validation of our theory.\nFor illustration, the position of the dimensionless resonance\nfrequencies in the complex plane for n = 5 and TM polar-\nization (all parities) is shown in Fig. 2. The figure shows\na clear separation of short-living resonances which are orga-\nnized along well-structured bands (Im\u2126 . \u22120.015), and long\nliving resonances whose position does not suggest any clear\norganization principle (Im\u2126 & \u22120.015), and therefore call\nfor a statistical analysis.\nFigure 3(a) and (b) shows examples of long-lived and short-\nlived quasibound states in the chaotic microstadium. The\ncomplex spatial pattern of the long-lived state is in strong con-\ntrast to the rather simple pattern of the short-lived state. Short-\nlived states in the microstadium resemble bouncing-ball states\nin the closed stadium billiard [39], which can be character-\nized by two quantum numbers corresponding to the number\nof nodal lines in horizontal and vertical direction. Bouncing-\nball states are usually ignored in the statistical analysis of the\nquantum spectrum of closed systems [60]. In the same spirit\nwe restrict in the following our attention to the long-living\nresonances, which are selected via a cut-off of the decay rate\n(Im\u2126 > \u22120.04 for n = 3.3, TM; Im\u2126 > \u22120.1 for n = 3.3,\nTE; Im\u2126 > \u22120.015 for n = 5, TM; Im\u2126 > \u22120.025 for\nn = 5, TE; in all cases we observe the same clear separation\nof long- and short living states as in Fig. 2).\nB. Determination of characteristic parameters\nA useful reference point for the quantification of the spec-\ntral fluctuations of the long-living resonances are the fre-\nquency and time scales set by their mean spacing along the\nreal frequency axis, and their mean decay rate. The nu-\nmerical values of the dimensionless quantities (\u2206\u2126)(tot)s and\n\u2212\u3008Im\u2126\u3009s are collected in Tab. I.

(b) Same but zoomed in onto the\nlong-living resonance frequencies.\ning indicates that we do not discriminate the resonances by\nparity. We now describe how this information can be used to\ndetermine the parameters M and \u03c4 which serve as input of\nthe RMT model. Because of parity conservation, we are inter-\nested in the effective parameters per symmetry class; the total\neffective matrix dimension irrespective of parity is denoted by\nM (tot) = 4M .\nLet us first assume that we could ignore the existence of\nwell organized sequences of short-living resonances with non-\nchaotic wave patterns, i.e., the case of a fully wave-chaotic\nresonator. The mean resonance spacing then follows the ordi-\nnary Weyl law (one state per Planck cell in phase space [25]),\n(\u2206\u2126)(tot)Weyl =\n2pi\nn2Re\u2126\nR2\nA\n, (5)\nwhere A = (4+pi)R2 is the area of the billiard. Analogously,\nthe dimensionM (tot) of the scattering matrix can be estimated\nby applying the Weyl law to the perimeter S = (2pi + 4)R of\nthe billiard (one channel per half wave length),\nM\n(tot)\nWeyl =\nnRe\u2126\npi\nS\nR\n.

As in Fig. 2, these states are computed for TM\npolarization and n = 5.\nTABLE I: The first two rows compare the dimensionless mean fre-\nquency spacing of long-living resonances in the stadium resonator in\nthe interval 66 < Re(n\u2126) < 82.5 (irrespective of parity) to the pre-\ndiction from the Weyl law (5). The third and fourth row tabulate the\nmean decay rate of the long-living resonances and the mean dimen-\nsionless decay rate in the dynamical model (3) (obtained in RMT in\nthe asymptotic limit M \u00c0 1). As described in the text, the relative\nscaling of these quantities can be used to determine the time scale \u03c4\n[Eq. (9)] and effective matrix dimension M = M (tot)\/4 (for fixed\nparity) [Eq. (10)], which are tabulated in the last two rows.\nn = 3.3, TM n = 3.3, TE n = 5, TM n = 5, TE\n(\u2206\u2126)\n(tot)\ns 0.00410 0.00418 0.00259 0.00263\n(\u2206\u2126)\n(tot)\nWeyl 0.00359 0.00359 0.00237 0.00237\n\u2212\u3008Im\u2126\u3009s 0.0143 0.0272 0.00395 0.00736\n\u2212\u3008Im \u03b8\u3009RMT 0.150 0.268 0.0645 0.1137\n\u03c4\/\u03c40 1.45 1.37 1.50 1.42\nM 37 38 37 38\nIn the dynamical model, eigenvalue equation (4) has M so-\nlutions with uniform statistical distribution of the phase Re \u03b8.\nThis translates into a mean dimensionless frequency spacing\n(\u2206\u2126)(tot) =\n2pi\nM (tot)\nR\n\u03c4c\n. (7)\nThe combination of Eqs. (5), (6), and (7) results in the relation\n\u03c4 =\nnpiA\ncS\n\u2261 \u03c40, (8)\nwhich coincides with Sabine\u2019s law for the mean propagation\ntime between encounters with the boundary. If applied to\nresonances of a fixed parity, the frequency spacing \u2206\u2126 =\n4(\u2206\u2126)(tot) quadruples, while the effective matrix dimension\n5M =M (tot)\/4 is reduced by a factor four. It follows from Eq.\n(7) that the time scale \u03c4 is not affected by these substitutions.\nThe finiteness of the time to establish wave chaos in an\nopen system results in the reduction of the number of long-\nliving quasibound states with respect to the prediction of the\nordinary Weyl law [Eq. (5)]; this is compensated by the for-\nmation of short-lived states [33]. A striking example is the\nemergence of a fractal Weyl law for systems with an Ehren-\nfest time which is comparable or larger than the typical life\ntime [31\u201335]. The formation of short-lived states also often\nresults in resonance trapping, a phenomenon which reduces\nthe average decay rate of the long-living resonances (as dic-\ntated by sum rules for the total coupling strength of the system\nto the exterior; see Ref. [38] for a detailed discussion). The\nexistence of well-organized bands of resonances deep in the\ncomplex-frequency plane (see Fig. 2(a)) indicates that both\nmechanisms are at work in the stadium resonator. As we now\nshow, the consequences can be described by renormalized pa-\nrameters M and \u03c4 .\nSince the reduced number of long-living resonances and\nresonance trapping both impact on the average characteristics\nof complex frequencies (affecting the real and imaginary part,\nrespectively), the renormalized parameters can be determined\nwithout resorting to the statistical fluctuations. As a first rela-\ntion, we compare the mean decay rate of long-living states in\nthe stadium to the prediction of RMT,\nc\u03c4\nR\n=\n\u3008Im \u03b8\u3009RMT\n\u3008Im\u2126\u3009s . (9)\nFor the second relation we evaluate Eq. (7) using the nu-\nmerically observed frequency spacing of the long-living reso-\nnances, M (tot)s = [2pi\/(\u2206\u2126)\n(tot)\ns ][R\/c\u03c4 ]. The effective ma-\ntrix dimension per symmetry class of fixed parity is therefore\ngiven by\nM =\npi\n2(\u2206\u2126)(tot)s\nR\nc\u03c4\n. (10)\nIn principle, Eqs. (9) and (10) need to be solved self-\nconsistently because the RMT average \u3008Im \u03b8\u3009RMT also de-\npends on M . For large values of M , however, the RMT av-\nerage saturates (see insets of Fig. 6). Practically, therefore,\n\u03c4 can be obtained from Eq. (9) by fixing M to a large value.\nThe actual value of M then follows from (10). This procedure\nis consistent if the resulting value M \u00c0 1. Table I tabulates\nthe values for \u03c4 and M which result when this procedure is\napplied to the resonances of the stadium resonator.\nFor all four combinations of refractive index and polariza-\ntion, we find that the collision time \u03c4 differs from the predic-\ntion \u03c40 of a totally wave-chaotic resonator by a factor of order\nunity, while the effective matrix dimension M is also almost\nidentical in all cases. Taking the mean over all four cases we\nobtain the values\n\u03c4 = 1.44 \u03c40, M = 38. (11)\nThe relation \u03c4 > \u03c40 can be attributed to the abovemen-\ntioned resonance-trapping mechanism, according to which the\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n 0  0.02  0.04  0.06  0.08\nP(\n-Im\n \u2126\n)\n-Im \u2126\nn=3.3, TM stadium\nRMT\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n 0  0.02  0.04  0.06  0.08\nP(\n-Im\n \u2126\n)\n-Im \u2126\nn=3.3, TE\nFIG. 4: (Color online).

I).\nstrong coupling of the short-living states to the exterior of the\nresonator must be compensated by a reduced coupling of the\nlong-living states [38]. The constancy of M and \u03c4 over all\nfour combinations can be attributed to the fact that we com-\npare equivalent frequency intervals 66 < nRe\u2126 < 82.5,\nwhile the internal classical ray dynamics is also fixed. Since\nthe total number of resonance frequencies in all cases agrees\nwell with the ordinary Weyl law (5), we can further conclude\nthat in all four cases the fraction of short- and long-living\nstates is comparable.\nC. Life time statistics\nWhen a resonator is employed as a microlaser, the quasi-\nbound states with the smallest decay rate within the amplifica-\ntion window tend to be the first that cross the lasing threshold.\nIn a simple model, lasing occurs as soon as the gain coun-\nters the losses through the interfaces [16, 19, 21\u201323]. The\nanalysis of the mean decay rate in the preceding section there-\nfore delivers a rough estimate of the necessary gain at the las-\ning threshold. The distribution of resonances in the complex\nplane (Fig. 2), however, suggests that the decay rates fluctuate\n60\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n 0  0.01  0.02\nP(\n-Im\n \u2126\n)\n-Im \u2126\nn=5, TM stadium\nRMT\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\n 0  0.01  0.02\nP(\n-Im\n \u2126\n)\n-Im \u2126\nn=5, TE\nFIG. 5: (Color online).

Such large fluctuations entail that some states have\na much smaller decay rate, which results in a reduced lasing\nthreshold. We now turn to the question whether these fluctua-\ntions are captured by the RMT variant of the dynamical model\n(3).\nHistograms of the decay rates of the resonances in the sta-\ndium resonators are shown in Figs. 4 and 5. For comparison,\nthe figures also show the prediction of the RMT model, with\nparameters given by Eq. (11). Since these parameters apply\nto the quasibound states of a fixed parity, the total spectral\nstatistics are obtained by the superposition of four systems\nwith identical effective parameters, but independent micro-\nscopic realizations of the M -dimensional random matrix U .\nThe RMT results in Figs. 4 and 5 are based on 50000 realiza-\ntions per combination of polarization and refractive index.\nIn all cases we find excellent agreement of all key features,\nsuch as the modal value (with maximal probability) of the de-\ncay rate, the width of the peak around the modal value, and\nthe shape of the distribution in the two tails. In particular,\nit should be noted that the average decay rates (tabulated in\nTab. I, and shown as large ticks in the figures) are noticeably\nlarger than the modal value of the decay-rate distribution. This\ndifference arises from the long tail of resonances with rela-\ntively large decay rate, which closely follows a slow power\nlaw. Such power-law tails are a robust feature of RMT mod-\nels [18], including models formed on the basis of the eigen-\nvalue problem (4) [48].

SUMMARY\nDynamical models with scattering matrices of the form\n(3) have recently attracted considerable attention, both within\nRMT [46\u201348] as well as for individual dynamical systems.\nIn particular, these models have been explored in associa-\ntion with the Ehrenfest time [28\u201330] and the related ques-\ntion of fractal Weyl laws [33\u201335, 49]. Some investigations\nof the Ehrenfest time employ an effective RMT model for\nthe scattering matrix [61\u201363]. In these investigations it was\nfound that certain transport properties (such as universal con-\nductance fluctuations and shot noise) are faithfully described\nby effective RMT, while others (such as the weak-localization\ncorrection) are not [29].\nThe present work is motivated by the suggestion in\nRef. [37] that the dynamical model (3) can also be used to\ndescribe the spectral fluctuations of long-living resonances in\nchaotic dielectric microresonators. We combined this model\n7with a variant of effective RMT, which is directly applied to\nthe internal round-trip operator U [33].\nWe confirm that the RMT variant of the dynamical model\ncaptures the key features of the life time statistics in a specific\ndielectric microresonator, the stadium-shaped resonator. This\ncomparison requires a careful determination of the effective\ncollision time \u03c4 of photons with the interfaces and the effec-\ntive number of modes M that are mixed by the reflections at\nthe boundary. Our analysis shows that these parameters can\nbe reliably obtained by using the mean resonance spacing and\ndecay rate of the long-living resonances. Compared to the\nassumption of complete wave chaos, the effective parameters\nare renormalized in a uniform way. This renormalization finds\nits natural explanation in the formation of short-lived reso-\nnances that resemble bouncing-ball modes, which changes the\nmean resonance spacing of long-living resonances [33], and\nthe resonance trapping phenomenon [38], which changes the\nmean decay rate.\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank H.
