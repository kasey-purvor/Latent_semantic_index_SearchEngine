There\u2019s a lot of \u2018I\u2019m tidying your room and \nkeep it that way.\u2019 In Saudi Arabia we grew too quickly and we are not organized \u2026 We need \nsomeone to organize us\n1\n \nSaudi merchant \n \n \nIntroduction \nSaudi Arabia is a paradigmatic capital- and resource-rich \u201crentier state\u201d (Crystal, 1995; Karl, \n1997; Luciani, 1990). As such, it is, on the one hand, strongly dependent on one resource and \nsuffers from administrative deficiencies (Chaudhry, 1997; Vandewalle, 1998). On the other \nhand, however, it enjoys a high degree of economic sovereignty due to its independence from \ninternational lenders and strong position towards trade partners.  \nIt was only in the course of Saudi Arabia\u201fs negotiations for WTO accession since the \nmid-1990s that international actors could make direct demands of economic reform towards \nthe Saudi government. And indeed, in the course of post-9\/11 skepticism towards all things \nSaudi, the US as main negotiation partner has exerted unprecedented pressure. This makes for \nan interesting case study of how reforms are initiated, negotiated and digested (or remain \nindigested) within the kingdom\u201fs rentier system. How do domestic reform interests and \ninternational conditionality interact, and how does this compare to the otherwise largely \ndomestic negotiation of reforms?  \nI intend to show how specific state structures and state-business relations can have \nvery different outcomes depending on whether international pressure is applied. The argument \nruns roughly as follows: Historically grown patterns of internal fragmentation in both public \nand private sector have held up various WTO-related reforms in Saudi Arabia as long as they \nwere negotiated within the Saudi system, as there has been no space for the domestic \nnegotiation of a WTO bargain. Due to the institutional specifics of the kingdom, more than \ndue to \u201cobjective\u201d interests of comparative advantage, no strong pro-WTO coalition emerged.  \nHowever, after membership application and a number of reform initiatives had \nlingered for several years, the Saudi leadership realized that US conditions in the membership \nnegotiations would only become harsher. US intransigence played a significant role in \nenabling a number of reforms which were rammed through in a top-down fashion by the \nleadership. Institutional fragmentation of interests again played its role, this time preventing \nan encompassing veto coalition against a comprehensive policy package which was in its \nsubstance imposed from outside. WTO conditionality has allowed the locking-in of certain \n                                                 \n1\n Cited in Montagu 2001, p. 48. \n 3 \nreforms. Fragmentation of state, business and relations between them can hence mean policy \nstalemate, but can also make for rapid policy adjustment under conditions of external \npressure.  \n \nTheory and structure of the article \nIn its discussion of institutional fragmentation and external conditionality, the article aims to \nadd to existing debates on trade policy. There are two theoretical traditions which deal with \nthe domestic aspects of international trade policy and the \u201cdistributional coalitions\u201d involved: \n\u201creductionist\u201d economic theories and more context-sensitive institutionalist approaches. The \neconomic theories attempt to explain trade policy interests referring to either comparative \nadvantages of specific factors or specific sectors of production (Mayer, 1984; Rogowski, \n1989; Frieden\/Rogowski, 1996; Rodrik, 1995).  \nFollowing the Stolper-Samuelson theorem of trade theory, the factor-based models \nanalyze the relative scarcity and abundance of factors of production (usually labor, land, and \ncapital) in a given national economy relative to the global economy. The factors which are \nrelatively abundant on the national level will have an interest in trade liberalization, as their \nprice will increase with growing integration into international markets. The reverse applies to \ndomestically scarce factors. Sector-based, or Ricardo-Viner models, by comparison, make the \nassumption that factors are not perfectly mobile at least in the short run, which means that \neveryone who is tied up in a sector of production which is not internationally competitive will \nsuffer. The predictions of the models are factor- and sector-based trade lobbying, respectively.  \nInstitutional approaches do not necessarily contradict the predictions which economic \napproaches make on individual interests, but argue that trade policy outcomes cannot be \nunderstood without an analysis of interest-aggregation and decision-making mechanisms \n(Goldstein, 1988; Gourevitch, 1986; Haggard\/Webb, 1994; Nelson, 1988; \nO\u201fHalloran\/Lohmann, 1994). Unfortunately, most institutional approaches focus on \ninstitutional mechanisms in Western democracies. \nIt is the economic approaches which therefore have more predictions to offer on the \nSaudi case, as they are deductive and general in nature. The article will hence evaluate Saudi \npolicy-making processes and outcomes against what factor- and sector-based models would \nmake us expect. In the resulting critique of economic approaches, I will liberally draw on \ninsights from the institutionalist literature to show how these might be complemented to cope \nwith non-Western cases like Saudi Arabia.  \n \n 4 \nGoing beyond standard assumptions of institutional models, I will emphasize the \ninstitutional origins of perceptions and interests.\n2\n I will moreover discuss the impact of absent \ndomestic interest-aggregation mechanisms on international trade negotiations. Although the \nSaudi story is rather specific, several of the insights generate generalizable predictions.  \nThe article is a first step towards bringing the analysis of state-business relations in \ndeveloping countries together with international political economy, and towards locating \nrentier states in the latter. If understood in their institutional context, categories from the state-\nbusiness relations literature such as associational capacity of business, or trust and reciprocity \nbetween state and business, can explain policy outcomes and the capacity to reach deals better \nthan deductive economic reasoning (Schneider\/Maxfield, 1997; Schneider, 2004; Moore, \n2004). A specific innovation this article makes in this context is the discussion of the \nambiguous effects of institutional fragmentation on policy outcomes. By fragmentation I \nmean the existence of separate actors within a larger section of the polity (government, private \nsector) and the incapacity of these to coordinate policies and collective responses. \nThe article will first survey the domestic setting of institutions and interests in Saudi \nArabia, covering both government and the private sector, explaining the fragmented nature of \nWTO debate and WTO adaptation attempts. In its second part, it looks at the broad \nchronology of international negotiations and analyzes their decisive impact on domestic \npolicies in recent years. The article is mostly based on interviews in Riyadh during field \nresearch from 2003 to 2005, as well as official documents and press reports. It does not claim \nto deliver a comprehensive account of the secretive accession negotiations, but it does make a \nbroad claim about the nature of domestic-international linkages in the Saudi political \neconomy, based on field research in the kingdom. The accession in November 2005 is taken \nas cut-off point. \n \nA note on Saudi Arabia\u2019s trade position and interests \nA capital-rich importer of goods and services for many years, Saudi Arabia has, at least \nformally, been a relatively open economy for a long time. Capital flows are free and its \ncurrency is fully convertible.  \nThere have been a number of formal restrictions on international trade, with protective \ntariffs for certain industries \u2013 up to 100 per cent in some cases, but usually not above 20 per \ncent (US Foreign Commercial Service, 2004). Certain imports require official licenses, and \nlike in other GCC states, distribution of international goods traditionally has to go through \n                                                 \n2\n For a more historical argument against reductionist explanations of economic and trade policy on other Middle \nEastern examples, see Chaudhry (1999).  \n 5 \nlocal \u201cagents\u201d. Until recently, foreign investment in commerce and a number of other \nimportant services such as banking and insurance was strongly limited. Altogether, however, \nin comparison with Middle Eastern states with longer histories of import-substitution, formal \nrestrictions on trade and services have been modest. \nAttempting to diversify its industrial base and to create employment to accommodate \nits youth bulge, the kingdom has had a number of good reasons for joining the WTO. A main \nmotivation is increased legal security for those of its industries which enjoy international \ncomparative advantages (Wilson, 2004: 76ff; Riyadh Bank, 2005), most prominently energy- \nand feedstock-intensive sectors like petrochemicals and its associated downstream (Sahlawi; \nRamady\/Mansour, 2006: 194f.). Saudi Arabia Basic Industries (SABIC), which is 70 per cent \npublicly owned and nowadays one of the world\u201fs leading petrochemical players, needs free \naccess to international markets and security from anti-dumping measures. The effect of WTO \nmembership on Saudi growth is expected to be positive (Chemingui\/Safadi, 2005). \nThough oil exports still dwarf non-oil exports by a factor of about 8, the latter have increased \ngreatly since the early 1980s, exceeding the non-oil exports of any other Arab country, and \nare set to increase further (Ramady, 2005: 257f., 276; Wilson, 2004: 81).  \n \n[Graph 1 about here] \n \nSaudi Arabia has had an increasing interest in being seen as a serious, credible and \naccountable international economic player. Since most major economic powers and all GCC \nstates had joined the WTO by 2000, membership became a necessary component of such \ncredibility,\n3\n and a prerequisite of non-oil diversification (Niblock, 2006: 138; ESCWA, 2001: \n62f.; Ramady\/Mansour, 2006: 191). \nThis has been the broad and generally agreed strategic rationale for the Saudi \nleadership. What about non-state interests in Saudi Arabia? This is the more empirically \ndifficult and arguably more interesting question. In the following, we will discuss what \nconventional theories of trade would predict about business and labor interests and \nsubsequently compare it with actual politics. \nSaudi Arabia seems a more likely candidate for sector-based economic explanations, \nas \u201cfactor specificity\u201d of Saudi private investment is relatively high. Saudi merchants tend to \nbe conservative, and they invest in rather large projects by regional comparison. Most \nagriculturalists, commercialists, and industrialists are well established in their respective \nsectors, having put in much of their own wealth and built up managerial structures which are \n                                                 \n3\n MEED, 8-11-1996, p. 53; various interviews in Riyadh 2003-2005. \n 6 \nindelibly linked to their own families. Most of the large non-state companies are not publicly \nlisted (Ramady, 2005: chapter 6). The Saudi business environment hence makes sunken \ninvestment hard to liquidate.  \nAt least in the short- to mid-term, sectoral interests should prevail. We should \ntherefore expect subsidy-dependent Saudi agriculture to be clearly poised against WTO entry, \nwhereas heavy industry \u2013 private petrochemicals in particular \u2013 should be strongly in favor of \naccession due to the large capital resources of large Saudi industrialists and the comparative \nadvantage of cheap energy.\n4\n Collective action for the few large heavy industry investors \nshould be easy (Baldwin, 1985: 12ff; Mayer, 1984). Positions of commercialists and \ncontractors can be expected to be more diffuse, as these are more labor-intensive sectors. \nAlthough expatriate labor in the kingdom is cheap relative to the West, it is expensive relative \nto some neighboring markets, in which Saudi companies are more likely to compete.  \nIn the less likely case that long-term factor-related interests should prevail, large \nplayers in the private sector \u2013 who dominate Saudi organized business \u2013 should generally be \nin favor of liberalization thanks to their large capital resources which could be put to good use \nin heavy industry.\n5\n Broad-based labor interests are more difficult to deduct. Assuming full \nfactor mobility, one might expect reluctance towards liberalization, as labor in the main \ncompeting markets in the Middle East and Asia tends to be even more abundant than in the \nkingdom.  \n \nDomestic Saudi interests: the state \nThe kingdom would have quite probably found it very easy to join the GATT in the 1980s,\n6\n \nwhen its economy was less open, but the US was much more easy-going on membership and \nSaudi Arabia was perceived as full ally in the Cold War (Hoekman\/Kostecki, 2001: 67).  \nThe GATT application was only submitted in 1993, however, and serious negotiations did not \nstart before 1996. At the time, the leadership was moderately optimistic about joining the \norganization soon. However, the negotiations and the concomitant reforms ran into a number \nof problems which, as will be argued, primarily reflected the domestic political economy of \nthe kingdom \u2013 more than the kingdom\u201fs \u201cobjective\u201d interests or, at the time, the course of \nnegotiations themselves. \n \n                                                 \n4\n Private Saudi capital held abroad has been estimated at up to 500 billion US$. They have become the leading \nbusiness stratum in the Middle East also in managerial terms; Oxford Analytica, 8-2-2006. \n5\n This logic is likely to apply more strongly to diversified groups which are active in several sectors to similar \ndegrees. \n6\n Interview with Saudi industrialist, March 2004. \n 7 \nStructure of agencies: fragmented administration  \nMost of all, the way WTO issues were digested domestically reflected the segmentation of \nSaudi institutions of government. To understand Saudi policy-making and implementation, it \nis important to know that Saudi government agencies tend to communicate little among \nthemselves: At the same time as being strongly centralized, ministries and other institutions \ntend to lead a rather insular existence; horizontal structures of coordination are under-\ndeveloped.  \nAs I have argued elsewhere, the reasons lie in historical patterns of rapid, oil-based \nstate-building since the 1950s. With the growth of national budgets, government institutions \nexpanded rapidly, often under different political patrons and with little need for regulatory co-\nordination, as distribution of oil wealth in one form or another ruled supreme (Hertog, 2005, \n2006b). Institutions were frequently used as tokens in games of power balance among royals \n(Herb, 1999), while an overarching civil service tradition which could have made for \ncoordinated bureaucratic growth was lacking (Awaji, 1971). Growing oil rents allowed for the \nsporadic creation of new institutions as reactions to new challenges, without ever leading to \nthe integration of different parts of the bureaucracy. The only common denominator was \ncentralization of ultimate decision-making power in a group of senior royals. A hub-and-\nspoke system of politics emerged by default rather than by design: organized around the royal \nfamily as arch-distributors, and defined by large-scale employment of redundant and often \nunmotivated staff in a plethora of different institutions, strictly hierarchical and \ncommunicating vertically with their royal patrons rather than horizontally with peer \ninstitutions (Binsaleh, 1982; Al-Hamoud, 1991). The large-scale bureaucratic growth and \ninjection of new technocratic talent in the 1970s and early 1980s gave individual institutions \nand senior commoner administrators more leeway in matters of policy implementation, but \nchanged little about the basically disjointed character of the system (Hertog, 2006b). \nDespite the excellence of individual bits of the bureaucracy, the state machinery has \nsuffered from incoherence and inertia in large areas (Al-Saleh, 1994; Al Saud, 1996; Ammaj, \n1990; SAGIA, 2003; Senany, 1990; World Bank, 2002). The administration is fragmented on \nthe meso-level, the level of individual agencies. This is not despite of, but rather because of \nthe rigid centralization of the system, which undermines horizontal communication and makes \nfor rivalries below the top level \u2013 an outcome of institutional history rather than of current, \n 8 \ndeliberate control tactics by the leadership.\n7\n As senior royals seldom get involved in minutiae \nof policy-making, fragmentation often rules supreme by default. \n \nIn this disjointed system, WTO issues have typically been pursued only by specific \nplayers, especially the Ministry of Commerce. Although there is a sizeable bridgehead of \nWestern-educated technocrats with liberal, pro-trade attitudes in the higher echelons of Saudi \nbureaucracy, this group is not organized as a political force. Many agencies were fully \nunaware of new WTO-induced requirements for legal and procedural change. Even in cases \nwhere communication took place on a senior level, changes in daily administrative practices \nin principle required for opening the Saudi economy often got unstuck due to lower-level \nsluggishness and incapacity. Technical expertise required for the nitty-gritty of WTO \nadaptation was frequently lacking.  \nAs any important decision, the one to go ahead on WTO issues was taken by senior \nprinces. The attitudes towards economic openness vary among the leading royals: Whereas de \nfacto head of government Crown Prince (now King) Abdallah has generally been seen as a \ndriver of reforms, Minister of Interior Prince Naif has been more careful, often trying to \ntightly control foreign influences.\n8\n Even if Naif has not been much involved in the minutiae of \ndaily regulation, Naif\u201fs senior status has meant that the Ministry of Interior (MoI) has become \nlargely impermeable for other Saudi agencies. Although it may not have worked actively \nagainst WTO accession, its strong and largely autonomous role in economic regulation has \nmade wholesale implementation of new rules more difficult.  \nOfficially, the Ministry of Commerce (MoC) under Usama Faqih was tasked with the \nWTO portfolio. It has not been a particularly powerful player among Saudi institutions. When \na number of other agencies voiced specific reservations on economic opening \u2013 usually trying \nto defend their respective sectors\n9\n \u2013 the MoC usually found it hard to force its way.  \nThe defense of agency interests has often trumped the common liberal outlook of a \nsizeable number of senior bureaucrats who usually have studied in the West and in principle \nare sympathetic to economic liberalization.\n10\n Many of the reforms discussed in a WTO \ncontext had been domestically debated for many years anyway, including capital market \nreform, intellectual property enforcement, competition regulation, bureaucratic capacity-\nbuilding, foreign investment reform and service liberalization. \n                                                 \n7\n The clientelist character of bureaucratic employment makes a politically autonomous bureaucracy a very \nremote prospect \u2013 never in Saudi history has a political challenge emerged from the ranks of the administration. \n8\n For some of Naif\u201fs statements cf. Arab News, 25-4-2000. \n9\n Interview with senior Saudi government consultant, June 2004. \n10\n Some 11.000 Saudi studied in the US towards the end of the 1970s; MEED, 14-12-1979, p. 51. \n 9 \nHowever, reform-minded technocrats have been functioning within a hierarchy which \ndoes not reward horizontal coordination. Agencies keep their documents secret, \ncommunication with other institutions is discouraged, and ministers are usually bent on \nmaximizing their regulatory turf vis-\u00e0-vis other institutions. Senior royals, if united, have the \npower to force decisions, but do not get involved in regulatory nitty-gritty too frequently.   \nThe set-up leaves a lot of space for inter-agency rivalries and incompatible policies. \nThis has created all the more stumbling blocks as US and EU applied a very broad \nunderstanding of WTO membership requirements in the negotiations, touching the \nresponsibilities of numerous agencies.\n11\n Issues included not only trade rules, but also \nadministrative procedures in general, investment regulations and the legal environment \n(Wilson, 2004: 91f.; Ramady\/Mansour, 2006: 192).  \nOther agencies were often unaware of WTO requirements,\n12\n and Faqih complained \nthat he did not have the full authority for negotiations.\n13\n When issues like foreign investment \nregulation, taxation, subsidies or product standards were deliberated in the course of general \nreform debates in the late 1990s and early 2000s, WTO criteria were often not taken on board. \nWTO issues were often perceived as a \u201eMinistry of Commerce problem\u201f within the \nadministration.\n14\n Inter-agency coordinative committees existed (SAMA, 2003: 47), but \npatently did not fulfill their function.  \n \nCapacity problems and mid-level bureaucratic resilience  \nThe MoC itself, a far less powerful player than MoI or Ministry of Finance, has suffered from \nits own capacity constraints, typical of the Saudi rentier bureaucracy in general, in which \nadjustment capacity is low and small-scale resistance to change can be strong. The MoC \napparently lacked the capacity to gauge the impact of WTO-induced changes on specific \nmarkets,\n15\n lacking reliable statistical data.  \nFormer bureaucrats as well as Saudi businessmen share the perception that the staff \nneeded to handle the highly technical WTO issues has been lacking in the Saudi \nadministration.\n16\n Despite overstaffing, and despite an accumulation of general economic \nexpertise since the 1970s, there frequently is a dearth of qualified specialists below the senior \n                                                 \n11\n The bilateral element in the WTO accession process generally leaves a lot of space for political interests, as the \ninsiders are in a strong bargaining position (Hoekman and Kostecki, 2001: 66f). \n12\n Interview with senior Saudi government consultant, June 2004. \n13\n Interview with functionary of General Investment Authority (SAGIA), May 2004. \n14\n Interview with SAGIA functionary II, April 2004.  \n15\n Interview with Western diplomat I, April 2004. \n16\n Interview with former Saudi minister, March 2004. \n 10 \nlevel, in the MoC and elsewhere.\n17\n Even if there is some technical understanding, it is often \non a theoretical level, with little grasp of business realities.\n18\n An internal government memo \nby a senior advisor in the late 1990s actually recommended that the negotiations be put on \nhold in order to build up technical capacity.\n19\n Technical missions to assist on WTO matters \n(cf. UNDP, 2004) have usually changed little about the lower levels of bureaucracy, where \npassive resistance to change has been widespread.\n20\n  \nWTO-related demands of procedural and administrative reform in particular have \nbecome bogged down in various little \u201cfiefdoms\u201d in the Saudi state, including entities such as \nthe customs administration and the judicial system. Contradictory and cumbersome rules, \nfragmented responsibilities, great de facto discretion for bureaucrats and judges as well as \nresistance to change have characterized these and other bodies (US Department of State, \n2001; ESCWA, 2001: 70ff.; World Bank, 2002; SAGIA, 2003). \n \nDomestic Saudi interests: private sector \nDespite its relatively liberal trade policy tradition, the Saudi government appeared structurally \nunprepared for WTO adaptation. Looking at the Saudi private sector, at first glance the \npicture appears much more encouraging: many of the large Saudi business groups are among \nthe most impressive in the Gulf and the Middle East region in general, not only in terms of \nsize, but also relative managerial sophistication (Luciani, 2005a, 2005b). Whereas the state \nhas in parts been atrophying, business has been slowly, but gradually expanding \u2013 though \ninitially starting as a dependent rentier class, decades of rent recycling have given \nbusinessmen deep pockets and have encouraged them to diversify substantially, serving \nprivate rather than state demand and contributing the dominant share to national capital \nformation (SAMA, 2006, table 9-6 in appendix). Saudi banks are among the most \nprofessional in the region, and private ventures in petrochemicals have set regional standards. \nSaudi businessmen have clearly emerged as leaders on the regional stage.\n21\n  \nOne might have expected Saudi business to play a proactive policy role on WTO \nissues, whether pushing for rapid accession or organizing articulate policy stances critical of \nthe undertaking. However, as we will see, in some ways the private sector mirrored the \nfragmentation of the administration: It has been divided and, more importantly, under-\n                                                 \n17\n Arab News supplement, 17-1-2004, pp. 17, 27. \n18\n Interview with member of Majlis Ash-Shura, April 2004. \n19\n Interview with former Saudi bureaucrat, November 2005. \n20\n Interview with British diplomat June 2003. \n21\n Oxford Analytica, 8-2-2006. \n 11 \norganized and under-informed on WTO matters. Although there was widespread \napprehension over WTO, it hardly congealed into meaningful programmatic statements.  \n \nAttitudes in the private sector \nAttitudes to WTO among Saudi businessmen have been distributed over a full spectrum of \nopinion from those open-heartedly embracing international exchange to those calling for \nprotection.\n22\n Experts expected less competitive businesses to suffer under the opening \n(Ramady\/Mansour, 2006: 193f., Ramady, 2005: 320ff., SAMBA, 2006). However, it has not \nbeen clear in the Saudi debate which sectors were perceived as the most endangered and \nmight have the highest interest in protection.\n23\n Different from what trade theory would make \nus expect, clear sector- or factor-based interests have not evolved. \nInvestors in heavy industry who in principle could have profited from trade \nliberalization did not act as a lobbying group at any point.\n24\n Among owners of lighter \nmanufacturing industries which have been protected with tariffs of either 12 or 20 per cent, \nthere were worries about competition,\n25\n but again, a clear sectoral position does not seem to \nhave emerged. When leading industrialist Abdalrahman Al-Zamil \u2013 himself prominently \ninvolved in heavy industry \u2013 openly asked for infant industry protection and for privileged \ndomestic market access as a reward for employing Saudi nationals, this did not appear to \nreflect a concerted policy position of Saudi industrialists or a broader lobbying campaign.\n26\n \nSaudi commerce with its trade agency privileges is one sector which could be \ninfringed upon by WTO, and agents are considered to be an interest group.\n27\n Accounts of how \nanxious commercialists are towards WTO vary widely, however,\n 28\n and with an exception to \nbe discussed below, there were no concerted demands. The same is true about agriculture and \ncontracting.  \nAlthough desultory lobbying attempts on specific tariff issues seem to have \nhappened\n29\n and there were many \u201elittle letters\u201f and smaller meetings of protest, 30 broader \npolitical campaigns have not occurred. The dislike of WTO has not led to the formulation of \n                                                 \n22\n Discussion with Saudi diplomat in Oxford, February 2005; Arab News supplement, 17-1-2004, p. 17. \n23\n Experts did make tentative sectoral assessments (cf. Ramady, 2005: 320ff.). These were hardly reflected upon \nin the broader debate, however. \n24\n Discussion with Western economic advisor, December 2005. \n25\n Interview with SAGIA functionaries III and IV; Western diplomat III June 2004. \n26\n Abdalrahman Al-Zamil on the Human Resources Development Forum, 23-25 May 2004 in Riyadh (author\u201fs \nnotes). \n27\n Interview with SAGIA functionary III, May 2004; Arab News supplement, 17-1-2004, p. 14. \n28\n Interview with member of Riyadh Chamber board, May 2004; interview with former Saudi minister, March \n2004; interview with Majlis Ash-Shura member II, May 2004. \n29\n Arab News, 18-5-2000, 13-4-2004; Saudi Gazette, 16-3-2004. \n30\n Discussion with senior Saudi bureaucrat, December 2005. \n 12 \nclear counter-proposals, whether from the private sector in general or from its sub-sectors.\n31\n \nInstead, a general, diffuse fear was spread across parts of the private sector that large \nmultinational enterprises might steamroll over local business (Malik, 1999: 259ff.; Ramady, \n2005: 316).\n32\n Some businessmen like Saleh Al-Kamel dressed their concern that economic \nglobalization is a potential danger in \u201cmoral\u201d and Islamic language.33  \nThe Chambers of Commerce and Industry, quite vocal on other policy questions, have \nbeen cautious in their statements on WTO.\n34\n Business voices clearly in favor of membership \nwere, again, individual ones, like that of Khalid Juffali, senior figure in a large family \nconglomerate with trade and industry interests.\n35\n On balance, and different from what factor-\nbased models would make us expect, it seems that skepticism was more pronounced than pro-\ntrade sentiment. More importantly, business players did not act as lobbying group either \nway.\n36\n Neither did sub-groups of business engage in systematic lobbying, indicating that the \nprivate sector\u201fs fragmentation approximated atomization, and therefore was deeper than that \nof the state, where at least agency-based interests existed. \n \nQuality of information and debate \nThe most striking feature of the on-and-off debate about WTO membership in Saudi \nArabia probably was the low level of information and tangible policy issues. \u201eIn many cases \nthere is sheer confusion\u201f37. The diffuse sense of peril among many businesses was based on \nlittle knowledge about actual questions involved in trade negotiations.\n38\n Frequently, technical \nreforms were seen as something for the government to deal with.\n39\n  \nRepeated complaints were made that the government did not provide enough concrete \ninformation on WTO.\n40\n However, the private sector itself was not proactive in researching \nWTO matters or augmenting generic knowledge about trade negotiations. Apparently the only \npublication on the matter by early 2004 had been an earlier pamphlet by Adel Faqeh\u201fs \nSAVOLA Group, entitled \u201eSaudi Arabia and WTO membership: The Promise and the Peril\u201f, \n                                                 \n31\n Interview with senior economist of Saudi bank I, December 2003. \n32\n Arab News supplement, 17-1-2004, p. 28.  \n33\n Gulf Business, May 1998. \n34\n A Riyadh Chamber study showing that Saudi will lose from WTO seems to have had no further impact (Malik \n1999: 34). For many years, few people turned up at Chamber meetings on WTO issues (ibid: 259ff.). \n35\n International Spotlight Saudi Arabia, Washington Post, 10 March 2001. \n36\n Interview with senior economist of Saudi bank II, December 2003. \n37\n Arab News supplement, 17-1-2004, p. 17. \n38\n Gulf Business, May 98. \n39\n Interview with British diplomat, June 2003. \n40\n Arab News supplement, 17-1-2004, p. 28; Saudi Gazette, 4 September 2003; Arab News, 7-9-2003. \n 13 \nwhich took an anti-WTO line.\n41\n It indicated that membership may lead to forced imports of \nalcohol and prohibitions on local ownership of broadcast media. \nAt least the latter statements were part of the \u201espectacular amount of disinformation \nabout the WTO\u201f42. Rumors spread that the WTO would force the total opening of Saudi \nborders, free access to the holy sites for non-believers and the replacement of religious Zakat \nby income tax.\n43\n The American assurance that such cultural exceptions to free trade would be \ntolerated did not stop the stories from circulating.\n44\n \nThe scare stories appear all the odder considering that the actual danger to the Saudi \nprivate sector from the WTO, although hard to gauge in detail, is moderate at most (SAMBA, \n2006). Saudi business by and large is relatively less protected and more sophisticated in \nmanagerial terms than that in most other Middle Eastern countries. In other Gulf and Middle \nEast countries, WTO membership (although admittedly acquired more easily) has not \nchanged very much about business practices. Most Gulf markets are not easy to access \nwithout local partners, which means that the latter will not disappear from the scene very \neasily.  \nThe lack of substantial debate about the WTO somewhat resembles the \nadministration\u201fs lack of readiness, and also seems to have institutional reasons, including the \nnon-provision of information by government and the absence of independent research \ncapacity in business associations (cf. Schneider\/Maxfield, 1997). Saudi business, as we will \nsee, can act as ad hoc veto player, but less so as integrated policy-maker. Despite managerial \nmaturity, it still lacks independent, coherently organized policy expertise.  \nThere seems to have been a vicious cycle of absent information and lack of clear group \nformation. Historically, most business players in Saudi Arabia have tended to pursue their \ninterests individually through personal links to princes and bureaucrats, apart from specific \njunctures where collective distributional interests were clearly at stake, such as taxes, budget \ncuts, and cuts in foreign manpower (Chaudhry, 1997; Hertog, 2005). On more complex \nissues, it has acted as policy-taker towards the traditionally paternalistic state. \nIndividual sophistication in the private sector seemed much ahead of its collective \nmaturity as interest group. Affirming an engrained pattern, this left the bureaucracy to deal \nwith policy specifics. Indeed, apparently it was the more efficient parts of the state which \ndefended sectoral interests the most clearly: SAMA defending privileges of domestic banks \n                                                 \n41\n Arab News supplement, 17-1-2004, p. 17. \n42\n Ibid., p. 13. \n43\n Interview with SAGIA functionary I, May 2004. \n44\n Arab News, 1-8-2003. \n 14 \nversus other agencies, and SABIC \u2013 as highly export-dependent company (Milner\/Busch, \n2004: 268f.) \u2013 pushing for WTO accession in order to gain secure access to petrochemicals \nmarkets.\n45\n Traditional islands of technocratic efficiency, they had the clearest policy positions \nbased on objective interests.  \n \nDeficient public-private interaction  \nFragmentation was also the dominant theme in the interaction of government and business on \nWTO issues. It was not the absence of talk about WTO issues as such which prevented the \ncommunication of policy interests \u2013 indeed, the topic was debated repeatedly in the chambers, \nand MoC figures addressed various business audiences.\n46\n \u201eLots of paper\u201f47 was produced. \nDeputy Minister Fawaz Alamy claims that he had more than 200 meetings with business \nrepresentatives.\n48\n Early on, a group was formed within the Chambers to consult the MoC \n(SAMA, 2003: 48). \nIts activities petered out, however,\n49\n and the symposia did not significantly clarify \ninterests on WTO. Ultimately, the attempts at public-private consultation were desultory: their \noutreach effects within the business community were limited, not least due to the low \ncoherence of the private sector as policy actor, which would have made it difficult to arrive at \na binding, reciprocal deal (cf. Schneider\/Maxfield, 1997).  \nJust as important, the government seemed unwilling to engage in meaningful dialogue: \nDiscussions were non-committal, ad hoc and limited to small audiences, and there was no \nfirm institutional framework which could have given them any binding character. Most of the \nsubstantive content of the membership negotiations was kept secret due to fear of backlashes \nthrough the media and business interest groups.\n50\n The actual gains of WTO membership were \nlittle advertised.\n51\n The absence of clear decision-making structures and responsibilities in and \naround the government served to underline the insignificance of public-private consultations \nwith the MoC and undermine its role as interlocutor. Trust between state and business and \nscope for credible agreements were limited. \n \n                                                 \n45\n Discussion with Western economic advisor, December 2005.

The lack of public education by the government \nhas been criticized in the press,\n52\n but the press itself did little to flesh out tangible issues of \nconcern to Saudi citizens. The Majlis Ash-Shura, an appointed quasi-parliament which is \nsupposed to represent public interests, was little more than a passive recipient of the \ngovernment agencies\u201f WTO policies.53 This is in remarkable contrast to the public interest \nwhich free trade issues have generated in other Middle Eastern and developing countries.  \nThere was no reaction from Saudi consumers, neither in favor of liberalization (as \npredicted by Grossman\/Helpman, 1994) nor according to their respective shares in the factor \nendowment (as Mayer (1984) argues). Similarly, no labor interests were articulated. \nThe main reason for absent societal demands is that potentially concerned interests \nhave simply not been organized in Saudi Arabia. Whereas business has been allowed to \norganize in a corporatist framework, the Saudi distributional system has co-opted and \nfragmented all other socio-economic interests (Chaudhry, 1997). Independent interest groups \nhave historically been suppressed. Labor in particular is kept out of politics through the large-\nscale importation of guest workers, who enjoy no political representation and whose presence \nleads to a segmentation of the labor market between Saudis and expatriates. Recent regime-\nled attempts to create formal \u201cinterest groups\u201d have been anemic and found little resonance in \nSaudi society (for details cf. Hertog, 2006a). \n \nChronology of WTO negotiations: crucial junctures and external conditionality \nThe account so far has been largely static, as appropriate for the analysis of the domestic \npolitical economy of the WTO accession process. As we will see, however, there have been \nrather rapid and significant changes on the level of legislation since 2003. To understand \nthese, a chronological overview of negotiations is necessary, with a special focus on the \ninternational dimension of the accession attempt as many changes have in the final analysis \nbeen driven by US pressure. \n \n                                                 \n52\n Muhammad Omar Al-Amoudi, Saudi agenda and WTO, Arabview, 5-1-2001; \nhttp:\/\/www.arabview.com\/articles.asp?article=75. \n53\n Interviews with Saudi banker, December 2003, former Saudi minister, March 2004. Majlis legislation itself \nhad not taken WTO requirements into account sufficiently over the years; interview with SAGIA functionary III, \nMay 2004. \n 16 \nNegotiations until 2003 under Usama Faqih \nIn early 1997, less than a year after negotiations had started, the hope was to gain admission \nbefore the end of the year.\n54\n Negotiations turned out to be more complex than the Saudi side \nhad initially thought, however, not least due to the breadth of issues broached, including \nservices and intellectual property rights.\n55\n Saudi market access offers drew criticism from the \nUS and other countries. The proposed binding tariff rates were seen as too high, often far \nabove actually applied levels, and important service areas were missing from the offer.\n56\n It \nseemed that the Saudi offer had been put together somewhat naively and the MoC had not \ntaken into regard the cross-sectoral nature of WTO negotiations. Many of the concessions \ndemanded would have gone beyond the administrative turf of the MoC, and as outlined \nabove, other agencies at the time cared little about WTO questions, leaving the MoC with \nincomplete negotiation authority. \nThe talks lingered on for several years, one sticking point being the Saudi demand to \nbe treated as developing country, which would give it generous transition phases and prevent \ninternal struggles (Smith\/Siddiqi, 2000). The MoC seemed to lack realism at the time, making \nrepeated announcements of impending accession which were denied by everyone else.\n 57\n In \nsummer 1999 it was speculated that if entry would not happen in early 2000, the issue would \nbe downgraded.\n58\n \nThe WTO issue indeed seems to have been put on hold on the Saudi side in 2000, as \nthe MoC had apparently exhausted itself and a decision was made to build technical capacity. \nAfter the disappointing November 2000 working party meeting (Montagu, 2001: 49), Saudi \nArabia \u201edid not answer the phone for two years\u201f when American negotiators wanted to debate \nWTO issues.\n59\n No dates for meetings were set,\n60\n although a large number of open issues \nwould have been up for debate, including insurance, customs regulations, tariffs, and rules for \nsettling commercial disputes.\n61\n In November 2001, Deputy Minister Alamy predicted at least \ntwo more years of negotiations.\n62\n \n \n                                                 \n54\n MEED, 17-1-1997, p. 4. \n55\n Oxford Analytica, 14-5-1997. \n56\n E.g. telecoms.

In late 2000, it was reported that new \nsponsorship and agency laws were under preparation.\n63\n  \nA change in commercial agency regulations was unlikely to revolutionize Saudi \ncommerce: foreign manufacturers usually do not get involved in local distribution and retail, \neven if they are allowed.\n64\n Moreover, in many cases the relationship of foreign exporter and \nlocal agent\/distributor is well-established and many of the large Saudi agents run quite \nprofessional businesses.\n65\n Nonetheless, agencies have high symbolic value for many Saudi \nbusinessmen, who made their first millions on this basis. There has been a strong feeling \namong businessmen that agencies should be Saudi (Niblock, 2006: 134). \nIt became clear from the WTO negotiations that something would have to be changed \nabout existing regulations.\n66\n A draft bill emerging from the MoC tied the abolition of \nmonopolistic commercial agencies in their established form to new competition regulations. \nThe law went through the Chambers \u2013 where it apparently was approved by a functionary not \nunderstanding its technical implications\n67\n \u2013 and reached the Majlis Ash-Shura.  \nWhen it transpired that agencies were about to be \u201ebusted\u201f at least on paper, several \nlarge distributors woke up to the challenge and started organizing a counter-campaign. The \nmain players included Abdalrahman Jeraisy, head of the Saudi Council of Chambers of \nCommerce and owner of several hundred agencies, and Abdallatif Jameel, a powerful Jeddah \nbusinessman who among many other things controls the extremely important Toyota \ndistributorship in the kingdom. Jeraisy \u201ewent wild\u201f 68 and concurrently with Jameel organized \nChamber delegations which complained to ministers and princes. From his offices, Jameel \nhad a \u201egrassroots campaign\u201f organized to mobilize concerned businessmen.69 The law was \nduly brought down in the Majlis Ash-Shura. Apparently Faqih had lacked the senior-level \nbacking to resist the onslaught.\n70\n \nAt the time, royal interest in specific WTO-related reforms and technicalities seemed \nto be muted. Pre-2002, there was only one (characteristically jolty) top-down initiative related \n                                                 \n63\n MEED, 1-12-2000, p. 38. \n64\n Interview with senior Saudi government consultant, June 2004. \n65\n No one will lose their agent according to a senior businessman; Montagu, 2001, p. 60; Oxford Analytica 2-11- \n2005. \n66\n Interview with senior economist of Saudi bank II, December 2003. \n67\n Interview with Western diplomat I, June 2004. \n68\n Interview with former deputy minister, May 2004. \n69\n Interview with Western diplomat I, May 2004. \n70\n The law was also said to have been badly constructed in technical terms; Interview with former deputy \nminister, April 2004; Arab News, 4-1-2004. \n 18 \nto trade liberalization: In May 2001, most Saudi tariffs were unexpectedly slashed to 5 per \ncent (Ramady, 2005: 318),\n71\n based on a decision in the Supreme Economic Council chaired \nby Crown Prince Abdallah. Although the move seems to have been more immediately related \nto the envisaged GCC customs union,\n72\n it was expected that the move would help with the \nWTO portfolio (Wilson, 2004: 32).\n73\n \n \nNegotiations under Hashim Yamani \nLittle happened otherwise. However, in a limited cabinet reshuffle in April 2003, Minister of \nCommerce Faqih was replaced by Hashim Yamani, previously Minister of Electricity and \nIndustry. Yamani, who holds a Harvard PhD in physics, has a much better reputation among \nbusinessmen as a pragmatic technocrat willing to communicate policies. By the time he was \nreplaced, Faqih was held in low esteem by many in the business community; some accused \nhim of \u201edisinformation\u201f on the WTO issue.74 \nWith Yamani\u201fs appointment, many Saudi and foreign businessmen perceived a \nsignificant acceleration of progress on WTO matters.\n75\n In parts, this seems to be due to his \nbetter management skills. At least as important, however, the leadership \u2013 again, quite \nprobably the Crown Prince, who is said to get along well with Yamani \u2013 had apparently \ndecided to force WTO issues around early 2003.\n76\n Yamani\u201fs appointment may have been part \nof this decision.\n77\n The kingdom finally seemed to be coming to terms with the external \npressure exerted mainly by the US and with the fact that whether fair or not, membership \nwould inevitably come with rather substantive strings attached.  \nRoyal frustration with lack of progress and Crown Prince Abdallah\u201fs interest in \npreserving his reformist credentials are likely to have been the driving factors.

Now, by way of royal fiat, international demands were rather directly translated \ninto change on the ground, leaving much less scope for inter-agency politics.  \nThe sudden adaptation proceeded in two main steps: first, the kingdom signed its \nbilateral WTO accession agreement with the EU in July 2003, making substantial concessions \non FDI liberalization in services, which had emerged as the biggest issue in the negotiations \ndue to the great potential of finance and telecommunications for foreign investors.\n82\n It appears \nclear that such steps were only possible thanks to high-level royal backing, in turn induced by \nthe persistence of international demands. The changes cut more deeply than previous \ndomestically negotiated reforms. In the same month, Yamani traveled to Washington to sign a \nbilateral trade and investment agreement,\n83\n which served as prelude to the second step: the \nbilateral agreement with the US. The latter would turn out to be even tougher and wider-\nranging than anticipated,\n84\n deepened the Saudi feeling that the goalposts were moving \n(Wilson, 2004: 91f.). US demands were wide-ranging, including issues of general \ntransparency, intellectual property rights and further service liberalization.\n85\n \n \nFurther regulatory change since 2003 \nThis delayed the final agreement, but less than one might have expected: By \nSeptember 2005, the US and Saudi Arabia had struck a (very comprehensive) final deal.

Adaptation measures which \nshould have happened years before \u2013 and had often been debated independent of WTO for \nmany years \u2013 were tackled under external induced royal pressure and Yamani\u201fs leadership.  \nFew broader measures of legal reform had been taken before 2003. However, \nsignificant legislation on intellectual property, trademarks and copyrights was issued in 2003 \nand 2004.\n86\n In summer 2003, a new capital markets law was published, providing for the \nsetting up of a formally independent Capital Markets Authority, which came into being in \n2004, and preparing the ground for the entrance of foreign investment banks. In summer 2003, \nan insurance law was issued, and in June 2004, a competition law provided for a new \ncompetition council, whose members were appointed in October 2005.  \nMoreover, several foreign banks have been licensed by the Saudi Arabian Monetary \nAgency since 2003 (SAMBA, 2006: 19), and in 2004, the rumor was that retail would be \nopened up to a maximum foreign ownership of 75 per cent, again encroaching on the \nestablished turf of national business.\n87\n Although Saudi officials are reluctant to admit that the \nWTO was the driver of such measures, it is generally agreed that these steps helped greatly in \nWTO negotiations.\n88\n Tellingly, most of the \u201ctouchy\u201d areas of FDI reform like finance and \ncommerce were only addressed once they had become topical in the negotiations.  \nThe final accession deal announced in November 2005 involved substantial \nconcessions in several areas, including 60 per cent foreign ownership in banking and \ninsurance, and 75 per cent foreign ownership of distribution within three years. Through an \n\u201cimporter of record\u201d clause, direct sales to Saudi buyers are now possible before customs \n(SAMBA, 2006: 9). Numerous technical concessions were made on trade procedures and \nstandards (WTO, 2005a, 2005b).  \nThe legal changes involved a plethora of agencies. Although several of them have run \ninto customary implementation problems, the reform drive was given unprecedented width by \nthe fact that persistent international demands were so comprehensive.\n89\n As they were directly \ntranslated into policy through the basic acceptance of the WTO deal by the royals, interagency \npolitics now mattered much less. Indeed, the fragmentation of the bureaucracy meant that \nthere was little scope for broader resistance during and after the late phase of negotiations. \n                                                 \n86\n Arab News, 6-7-2004. \n87\n Interview with SAGIA functionary III, May 2004. \n88\n Interview with senior Saudi government consultant, June 2004; more candid interview partners admitted a \ngreat role of the WTO. \n89\n Interview with Western diplomat I, November 2005. \n 21 \nBureaucratic veto players who may have procrastinated on individual technicalities had \nreceived a clear signal from the top that the externally imposed \u2013 and externally judged \u2013 \npackage would have to be accepted in its totality.\n90\n  \nSimilarly, there appears to have been little organized business protest against any of \nthe measures. As it was clear that a royal decision to move ahead had been made and WTO \nmembership was seen as inevitable, business remained largely silent on most of its \nimplications. There were some cautiously positive post hoc comments from business after \naccession had eventually happened \u2013 as tends to occur in the kingdom once a decision has \nbeen taken \u2013,91 but no coherent policy statements or analysis of the situation. As the Saudi \npress complained in early 2004, when the leadership\u201fs acquiescence to external demands had \nbecome obvious, with few exceptions it was \u201ean almost impossible task\u201f to get those to talk who \nwere opposed to the WTO \u2013 different from the years before, when the debate was disorganized, \nbut some anti-WTO voices were clearly audible. \u201eIt soon became obvious they [anti-WTO \nbusinessmen] did not want to raise their heads above the parapet, knowing that the authorities are \nin favor.\u201f92  \n \nDo the results all boil down to the timing of royal fiat? Yes and no. Although the \ndecision to move ahead and acquiesce was taken within the royal family, it is important to see \nthat the core ingredients of the subsequent policies had effectively been shaped abroad. It is \nunlikely that the princes by themselves, with their often limited technical understanding of \nreform issues, would have devised the comprehensive policy packages of recent years.\n93\n And \njudging from the record of other reforms (Hertog, 2005), the leadership, even if initially \nthrowing its weight behind a new policy, would have been reluctant to overcome resistances \nalong the road, however local. In this sense, the royal leadership was, despite all its \ncentralized power, an intervening variable transmitting a set of external demands. \nNo matter how upset Saudis are about the squeezing their old American allies have \ngiven them, many freely concede that the WTO process has helped to accelerate a number of \nreforms within the kingdom.\n94\n Deputy Minister Alamy himself has explained that WTO \nmembership will speed up privatization (not per se a WTO issue) and lock in reforms.\n95\n  \n                                                 \n90\n Ibid. \n91\n Arab News, 10-11-2005; 12-11-2005.  \n92\n Arab News supplement, 17-1-2004, p. 17. This is very much my own experience, too. \n93\n A seasoned Western observer involved in the negotiations stressed the crucial role of an external \u201cjudge\u201d for \nkeeping the reform package coherent and preventing it from fizzling out between different government agencies; \ninterview with Western diplomat I, December 2005. \n94\n Interview with senior Saudi government consultant June 2004. \n95\n Arab News supplement, 17-1-2004, p. 16. \n 22 \nLeading businessmen have stated that the WTO has actually helped the government to push \nthrough awkward measures.\n96\n Indeed, many of the steps taken now had been prevented before \nthrough inter-agency cleavages, endless deliberation and lack of business support, notably the \nopening up of the financial sector and commerce, which had remained on the \u201cnegative list\u201d \nfor foreign investors in the course of the 2000 FDI reform.  \nAgainst the background of an otherwise fragmented political economy, this is \nsignificant: liberal Saudi technocrats by themselves have not been able to engineer a pact for \ncross-cutting reforms, as negotiation and aggregation mechanisms were lacking and their \ninterests hence were often tied up within their local institutional and patronage structures. \nWith the WTO-induced pressure, translated domestically through a royal decision to move \nahead, the liberal technocrats were able to pursue policies which had been languishing in their \ndrawers \u2013 and debated in inter-ministerial committees \u2013 for many years. Remarkably, some \ndomestic reform measures seem to have been pushed through under the WTO tag although they \nare not strictly linked to the WTO\u201fs technical requirements, including reform of the Saudi court \nsystem.\n97\n  \n \nConclusion  \nThe Saudi bureaucracy has been suffering from a combination of low technical \ncapacity and lack of horizontal coordination. The two together have resulted in deficient \ninformation on WTO matters and incapacity of the state to internally coordinate the \nadaptation to WTO requirements. The isolated structure of administrative \u201cfiefdoms\u201d meant \nthat even reform-minded bureaucrats were subject to institutional constraints and could not \ndevelop collective political agency.  \nThe private sector was even more fragmented, with the contrast between individual \nsophistication and lack of collective capacity being even more striking. At one point at least, \nleading representatives of the commercial sector managed to veto an ill-managed reform \nproject of the MoC. But the resistance was specific and ad hoc, not representing a stable \ncounter-coalition with a programmatic vision. Our theoretical expectation had actually been that \ncommercial interests should be more diffuse than others. The veto lobbying was based not on \nbroad factor-based interests, however, but on a specific issue which was in parts symbolic. \nArguably more substantive questions of financial liberalization e.g. saw less coherent \nlobbying. \n                                                 \n96\n Ibid., p. 17. \n97\n Interview with Western diplomat I, December 2005. \n 23 \nIn toto, the Saudi system was set for policy drift, as it offered no space and no \nchannels for building broader alliances towards either policy change or coordinated \nresistance. Levels of trust and reciprocity between state and business were low. This was the \nsituation as long as adaptation measures were negotiated mostly domestically. \nHowever, once the Al Saud leadership had realized that external conditionality would \nonly become harsher with time and decided to adopt external demands wholesale, the effects \nof fragmentation reversed: It was the very lack of coherent political agency in the Saudi \nsystem which made for a swift implementation of the formal-legal aspects of the WTO \npackage. As soon as a top-down decision to go along with an integrated pack of external \ndemands had been taken by the leadership (apparently in early 2003), the fragmented \nbureaucracy fell in line and acquiesced to measures which had been discussed for many years, \nbut never came to fruition domestically. Business similarly acquiesced, the difference being \nthat there had been less effective resistance in the first place. \n \nTheoretical remarks \nIt is clear that neither factor- nor sector-based economic models had anything to contribute to \nthe explanation of actual outcomes in the Saudi case. This is despite the rather high maturity \nof the Saudi economy and a number of clear deductive predictions on domestic interests. The \npredictions were based on a very rudimentary interpretation of the economic models. But it is \nnot clear how more sophisticated deductive approaches should have added any insights on a \nprocess which, as we have seen, has been historically and institutionally determined. \nBusiness, labor and other potential interests failed to coalesce for concrete social and \ninstitutional reasons.\n98\n As far as concrete trade interests were voiced, these had very little to \ndo with abstract attitudes towards the \u201clevel of economic integration\u201d, but with specific \nsectoral regulations.  \nThe role of institutions in trade policy is still underexplored (Milner, 2002: 458). \nInstitutional models tend to be either rather unspecific \u2013 focusing on very general variables \nsuch as \u201ccentralization\u201d or \u201cauthoritarianism\u201d \u2013 or too much geared on the US system. It is \nnot my claim that my more ideographic and complex explanation of the Saudi case will yield \na general institutional model of trade policy. I doubt the latter is possible. My analysis should \nhowever yield a number of testable hypotheses for significant aspects of two-level economic \npolicy-making in a range of cases specifically in the developing world. \n \n                                                 \n98\n Oil price changes of recent years also did not lead to any of the shifts Frieden and Rogowski would predict in \ntradable\/non-tradable sectoral interests (1996: 41f). \n 24 \nRentier fragmentation \nFragmentation of state and society is a specific historical outcome of Saudi rentier history. \nAlthough not an automatic result of oil income, a number of Middle Eastern rentier countries \nwith weak pre-oil states such as Qatar, the UAE, Libya and Oman appear to have similar \ninstitutional structures (or institutional \u201clegacies\u201d; Goldstein, 1988). Sectoral interests on \ncomplex issues are under-organized, bureaucracies fragmented. In all these cases, we should \nexpect a general weakness of policy coalitions which can potentially slow down liberalization \nmeasures. At the same time, leaders at the apex of the system should be able to circumvent \ndomestic interests rather effectively and swiftly if they are determined to negotiate \ninternational economic liberalization. The lack of powerful intermediary structures of interest \naggregation has a strongly ambiguous impact.\n99\n \nThere are many non-rentier reasons for and forms of fragmented polities. The causal \nmechanisms outlined here should provide useful heuristics for their analysis. It is worthwhile \nto briefly situate them in the general institutionalist literature on trade. \n \nEffects of fragmentation \nIt has been argued that a large numbers of parties \u2013 i.e. complex ruling coalitions \u2013 make it \ndifficult to change the policy status quo (Haggard\/Kaufman, 1995; Tsebelis, 2002). Moreover, \ndivided government reportedly increases levels of protection and makes liberalization more \ndifficult (O\u201fHalloran, 1994, O\u201fHalloran\/Lohmann, 1994). Absent direct royal intervention, \nthe fragmented Saudi bureaucracy seems to be the functional equivalent of divided \ngovernment or a fragmented party system, effectively containing a considerable number of \nveto players.\n100\n As we have seen, such fragmentation can indeed make it more difficult to \nchange the status quo. If external pressure comes into play, however, changing the status quo \ncan actually become considerably easier, as counter-coalitions are less likely to be formed. \nNegotiators can use the two-level negotiation game to impose an otherwise unfeasible policy \npackage (Evans et al, 1993). \nFragmentation does not only have an impact on coalitional logic, but also on interest-\nformation itself. In the Saudi case, most players had little clear interests beyond their \ndefensive reflexes, not least due to the absence or fragmentation of information: The impact \nof institutional fragmentation on collective interest formation is exacerbated by the costs of \n                                                 \n99\n Once could say that through their state- and clientele-building strategies, regimes have manipulated the \nstructure of interest representation (Nelson, 1988), but on a larger historical scale than envisaged in institutional \ntheories. \n100\n Liberalization supposedly is the most successful where trade policy is delegated to insulated bureaucratic \nbodies (Haggard\/Webb, 1994). This is patently not the case if there are other bureaucratic veto players.  \n 25 \nacquiring and disseminating information (which are generally high on complex policy matters \nsuch as trade; Baldwin, 1985: 9). In the Saudi case a fragmented institutional environment did \nnot only determine the (non-)aggregation of preferences, but also left preferences themselves \nin a diffuse and ill-informed state, notably in the case of Saudi business with its lack of \ncollective policy-making capacities (Thelen, 1999: 374-377; Milner, 2002: 455). As \ninstitutional deficits result in weakness or absence of clearly formulated rational interests,\n101\n \nthey leave more scope for \u201csubjective\u201d interests (as in the case of the trade agencies and the \ngeneralized unease of business) and, possibly, politics of identity (as in the case of \nbusinessman Saleh Kamel\u201fs Islamic moralizing).  \nThe problem for Saudi business was not so much that it could not organize the \nrepresentation of views which in general were clear. It was rather the very lack of an \ninstitutional field in which clear views could have been created in the first place through \nsound information and encompassing debate. Business was internally fragmented or atomized \non a micro-level. This fragmentation was sustained not least by the fact that it operated in a \ngenerally disjointed system that provided few incentives for collective action, as secrecy and \nmeso-level fragmentation of the state did not make the latter a credible negotiation partner. \nThere was no scope for a policy-oriented state-business coalition, as both parties lacked \ncoherence. \nFragmentation and level of institutional and coalitional coherence are useful \nexplanatory factors for policy-making capacity and policy outcomes across different political \nsystems. In the context of state-business relations, the capacities of organized business as well \nas trust and reciprocity between state and business need to be assessed to determine the \ncapacities of interest-formation, policy coordination and coalition-building \n(Schneider\/Maxfield, 1997). The state-business literature, not yet linked to IPE, can help to \nmove trade policy analysis beyond \u201cconventional\u201d political institutions, which often do not \nexist or are not relevant for developing countries. The international linkage of such set-ups is \na field on which the present case has provided counterintuitive insights. \n \nShifting roles of leaders \nThe Saudi leadership has played an ambiguous role in this context, which shows that \u201chigh\u201d \nor \u201clow\u201d centralization are not always unambiguously detectable, as the literature might make \nus expect. On the one hand, Saudi ministries in fact had to negotiate among themselves for a \n                                                 \n101\n Better availability of information arguably empowers protectionist groups (Goldstein and Martin, 2000). In \nthis sense, Saudi Arabia was very lucky. \n \n 26 \nlong period, indicating low de facto centralization of policy-making (Nelson, 1988: 825f.). On \nthe other hand, the top-down implementation of the external policy package through the royal \nfamily indicated a very high level of centralization. Similarly, the hypothesis that trade \nliberalization is more successful under authoritarian rule (Haggard\/Webb, 1994) does not \napply in any straightforward way to the fragmented Saudi case. Institutional fragmentation \nmight be a more useful (and more universal) explanatory variable. The model adumbrated \nhere calls for further systematic research on the comparative dynamics of domestically versus \ninternationally negotiated reforms. \n 27 \nReferences \nTrade journals and newspapers \nAMEINFO \nArab News  \nArabview \nFinancial Times \nGulf Business \nJournal of Commerce \nMEED (Middle East Economic Digest) \nOxford Analytica Daily Briefs \nSaudi Gazette \nWashington Post \n \nOther \nAmmaj, Bader Al- (1993) \u201eAdministration in traditional society: the case of recruitment and  \nselection in public sector employment in Saudi Arabia\u2019, unpublished PhD thesis, \nUniversity of Southampton. \nAwaji, Ibrahim Al- (1971) \u2018Bureaucracy and society in Saudi Arabia\u2019, unpublished PhD  \nthesis, University of Virginia. \nBaldwin, Robert (1985), The Political Economy of U.S. Import Policy, Cambridge, Mass.,  \nLondon: MIT Press. \nBinsaleh, Abdullah Mohammed (1982) \u2019The civil service and its regulation in Saudi Arabia\u2019,  \nunpublished PhD thesis, Claremont Graduate School. \nChaudhry, Kiren (1997) The Price Of Wealth: Economies and Institutions in the Middle  \nEast, Ithaca: Cornell University Press. \nChaudhry, Kiren (1999) \u201ePrices, Politics, Institutions: Oil Exporters in the International  \nEconomy\u201f, Business and Politics, 1(3): 317--342. \nChemingui, Mohamed and Safadi, Raed (2005) Saudi Arabia [sic] Long Road to WTO  \nMembership: The Potential Payoffs, Cairo: Economic Research Forum December \n2005. \nCrystal, Jill (1995) Oil and Politics in the Gulf: Rulers and Merchants in Kuwait and Qatar,  \nCambridge: Cambridge University Press.  \nESCWA (2001) WTO Issues for Acceding Countries: the Cases of Lebanon and Saudi  \nArabia, New York: United Nations. \n 28 \nEvans, Peter, Jacobson, Harold and Putnam, Robert (eds) (1993) Double-Edged Diplomacy:  \nInternational Bargaining and Domestic Politics, Berkeley: University of California \nPress. \nFrieden, Jeffrey and Rogowski, Ronald (1996) \u201eThe Impact of the International Economy on  \nNational Policies: An Analytical Overview\u201f, in H.
