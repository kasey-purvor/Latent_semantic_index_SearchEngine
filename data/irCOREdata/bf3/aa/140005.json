A particularly influential family of\ntheoretical models concerned with the processes and\ndynamics of species evolution has been adopted\nfrom the fields of biology and ecology. This paper\nscrutinizes the relevance of biological evolutionary\ntheory to sustainable natural resource management\nbeyond identification of the core analogy, namely\nthat both natural resourcemanagement and ecological\nsystems are characterized by multiple interacting\nelements requiring systemic interpretation. A review\nof the workings of co-evolutionary theory within its\nintellectual homeland of biology and ecology leads\nto a critical evaluation of its use as a descriptive\nmodel outside of these domains. Findings from this\nassessment identify a number of fractures in meaning\nas the co-evolutionary model is transferred between\ndisciplinary fields, suggesting that the transposition\nhas been conducted without sufficient rigour or\nconsistency. A measured reinterpretation of the\napplicability of the co-evolutionary model to natural\nresources management is thereby undertaken. Using\nwater management as a context, the paper posits a\nseries of phenomena which might provide a focus for\nthe application of the co-evolutionary model outside\nof biology and ecology. In conclusion, the paper argues\nthat the research community needs to move beyond\na consideration of the complex implications of co-\nevolutionary processes to the establishment of a firm,\nprocess-based definition of co-evolution as a type of\nchange.\nKeywords: co-evolution, natural resource management,\nsocio-natural science, sustainability, water management\n*Correspondence: Dr P.

Elements can be\nfound in the literature on economics (industry sector\ndynamics, innovation processes and risk-taking behaviour),\npsychology (characteristics of inventors and risk takers),\nphilosophy of science (roles of innovation\/invention),\nsociology (population dynamics, sociology of groups and\nnetworks), anthropology (collapse of complex societies) and\nevolutionary theory (role of diversity and adaptation in\nsurvival). In pursuing a comprehensive theoretical framework\nwhich allows description of the system and its properties,\ncredible diagnosis of the causes of undesirable system\nbehaviour and legitimate prescription of remedial action\nor intervention, researchers have been attracted to models\nsourced from the biological sciences. The reasons for\nsuch partiality are not difficult to identify; many of the\ncurrent threats to sustainable development impact on natural\nsystems and many of the early sustainability paradigms were\npremised on the preservation and conservation of the natural\nenvironment (Thiele 1999).\nThe starting point for this review is our observation\nthat the investigation of sustainability attracts theoretical\nframeworks from the natural sciences. Many authors (for\nexample Hodgson 1993; Allen 1994; Funtowicz & Ravetz\n1994; Giampietro 1994; Clark et al. 1995; Funtowicz &\nO\u2019Connor 1998) have emphasized that understanding the\ncomplexity, variation and uncertainty inherent in living\nsystems is central to the pursuit of sustainability.\nVariousmodels of interactive dynamic system relationships\nhave been developed to study human and natural systemswith\nthe aim of countering deficiencies in static linear analysis.\nMany such models have been adopted and adapted from the\necological and biological sciences. These include conceptual\nframeworks which emphasize processes and phenomena such\nas complexity, self-organization, adaptation, evolution and co-\nevolution. Perhaps themost intuitively powerful of these is the\nidea that the development of societies is the compound result\nof different activities that to some extent fit together and need\neach other (Norgaard 1994); a process of co-evolution which\nis typical of many complex systems (Tainter 1988). Indeed,\nco-evolution is increasingly seen as a useful framework within\n2 P. Jeffrey and B.S. McIntosh\nwhich to consider complex multi-disciplinary issues (Gowdy\n1994; Stokes 1994). Authors such as Geldof (1995a, b) have\nused such concepts to inform the debate about appropriate\nnatural resource management processes.\nThe language and semantics of biological theories have\nbeen used as a clarion call to recognize the connectedness and\nmutual dependence of social and natural systems, butwe argue\nthat this has been undertaken with little consideration of the\nlimits or utility of the analogies beingdrawn.Such reservations\necho the advice of Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1831) who urged\nthat \u2018whether you are reflecting for yourself or reasoning with\nanother, make it a rule to ask yourself the precise meaning of\nthe word on which the point in question appears to turn; and\nif it may be . . . used in several senses, then ask which of these\nthe word is at present intended to convey\u2019.\nAlthough the motivations for adapting theory from the\nnatural to the socio-natural sciences are laudable, the way in\nwhich these analogies have been constructed and subsequently\ninterpreted are a concern; especially with regard to the\nuse of models of co-evolution. The roots of this concern\nare twofold. Firstly, models, analogies and theories are at\nroot metaphors, and can thus only ever be partial truths.\nWithout an explicit consideration of the limits of models in\nboth their original (ecology\/biology) and proposed (natural\nresources management) settings, there is no basis on which\nto advise practitioners on the applicability or reliability of\ninsights or prescriptive advice which emerge from themodels\u2019\nuse. Secondly, by adopting and promoting models from one\nparticular field of science, there is a risk that contributions\nfrom other intellectual traditions will be discounted or at\nleast disregarded. Not all models are equally useful; there\nis a need to debate and evaluate the utility of different models\nas devices to inform the quest for sustainability. The premise\nthat \u2018we cannot . . . guarantee the persistence of any particular\nsystem in perpetuity\u2019 leads to a view of sustainability as a\n\u2018normative ethical principle\u2019 which has \u2018no single version\u2019 and\nis \u2018a process, not a state\u2019 (Robinson et al. 1990). Debating the\nappropriateness and utility of different models is part of this\nprocess, but will not in itself inform management action.\nNatural resources management is selected here as the\nsubstantive domain within which these debates will be\npursued. In particular, we use the challenges posed by water\nmanagement as a context for evaluating the usefulness of\nthe co-evolutionary model. Water is a resource which has\nsignificant impacts on the composition of living systems\nand the physical environment across a range of scales from\nindividual organisms to whole ecosystems, from a few hours\nto many hundreds of years. It is a resource that, for the\npurposes of sustainable management, requires coordinated\n(or integrated) consideration of a broad range of knowledge\nfrom disciplines such as technology, hydrology, ecology,\npsychology, anthropology and economics to name but a few.\nThe aimsof this paper are twofold.An analytical component\ninvolves the exploration and critical assessment of the\napplication of co-evolutionary theories and models to the\ndomain of natural resources management in general and\nwater resource management in particular. This is a task\nthat cannot be robustly undertaken without (1) developing\nan understanding of the workings of evolutionary and co-\nevolutionary theory, and (2) considering water management\nas part of a wider set of issues concerned with sustainability\nand socio-natural interactions. The first task is to clarify the\nmeaning of the models and theories \u2018on which the point\nin question appears to turn\u2019. This is the guiding principle\nbehind the following discussions of both evolutionary and co-\nevolutionary theories. Subsequent sections critically review\nand evaluate how co-evolutionary theory has been transferred\nand applied to support understanding of socio-natural\ninteractions, the aim being to determine if and how co-\nevolution can be used as a conceptual model for promoting\nsustainable modes of water management. The second aim of\nthe text is to respond to the critique presented in the opening\nsections and offer a research agenda which might advance\nunderstanding of co-evolutionary processes in the context of\nwater management.Wemake no claim for the co-evolutionary\nmodel to have particular descriptive or prescriptive potency\ncompared with competing perspectives; we simply wish\nto argue its limitations, counsel against its unconditional\napplication and propose a means for improving its relevance.\nDYNAMICS AND EVOLUTION: SYSTEMS\nAND THEORIES\nA system can be defined generally as being composed of\nelements, organized in some way and interacting according\nto some set of rules (von Bertalanffy 1968). For the purposes\nof this text, systems (as a type of model) are viewed as\nepistemological devices, languages for conceptualizing the\nsocio-natural world to inform processes of dialogue and\naction concerned with human use and management of natural\nresources. As interactions unfold over time, a system will\nchange state; the rules of interaction will map one system\nstate onto another. Such systems exhibit dynamics but, as\ncurrently defined, are not evolutionary. The number of types\nof elements and the form of the rules governing interaction\nare static.\nFor a system to be termed \u2018evolutionary\u2019, it must have the\npotential to change not only state but also (a) structure (in\nthe sense of the range of different types of elements), and\n(b) the form of its rules of interaction (Klu\u00a8ver 2002). Dynamic\nprocesses are thosewhich change state.Evolutionaryprocesses\nare those which change structure and interaction rules,\ntypically precluding the possibility of previous system states\nre-occurring. Evolutionary systems are thereby irreversible\nand are often labelled \u2018historical\u2019 as their current structure,\nstate and rules can only be understood with respect to\ntheir unique developmental trajectory. Human systems are\nevolutionary; they are the product of a dynamic history that\nhas resulted in new instances and types of elements, new\nconfigurations of elements and the continued reshaping of\nrelationships between those elements.\nCo-evolutionary models and natural resource management 3\nA useful pre\u00b4cis of the central characteristics of the\nevolutionary model is available by paraphrasing Nelson\n(1995), who describes \u2018evolutionary\u2019 as a class of theories\nin which: the aim is to understand the change of a variable\nor a system over time and to explain why it is as it is at\na given moment in time in terms of how it got there; and\nthe explanation includes (a) random elements capable of\ngenerating or renewing variation in the system in question (the\ncreation of novelty in or renewal of the system state possibility\nspace), (b) mechanisms that winnow on extant variation\n(selection, the reduction of the system state possibility space),\nand (c) mechanisms that provide continuity for those elements\nof the system that survive winnowing (persistence, the\nmaintenance of the system state possibility space).\nDo all examples conforming to the definition of evolution\ngiven by Klu\u00a8ver (2002) also conform that given by Nelson\n(1995)? The answer is not obvious as the two definitions focus\non different aspects of system change, namely structure and\nrules (Klu\u00a8ver) versus change in variation (Nelson). Although\nthere is no opportunity to explore a reconciliation of these\ndefinitions, it should be noted that further research is needed.\nEvolutionary theories are best suited to explain the observed\nhistory of systems given that the operation of randomelements\nand novelty limits the ability to predict. Depending on\nhow various types of mechanism (variation generation versus\nvariationwinnowing versus variation continuity) are specified,\nevolutionary theories can be given more or less deterministic\n(predictable) interpretations.However, in the context of socio-\ncultural evolution, Klu\u00a8ver (2002) concluded that societal\nchange, particularly in modern societies, was unpredictable\nowing to the inherent dynamics in structure and rules of\ninteraction, something quite different from systems studied\nby predictive disciplines like physics, where the rules of\ninteraction between system elements are time invariant.\nIn Neo-Darwinian biological theory (presented as the\n\u2018Modern Synthesis\u2019 by Julian Huxley 1942) the evolutionary\nsystem is the genetic structure of the population (or species).\nIt is here that adaptation occurs through various mechanisms\nincluding the natural selection of individual organisms via\ninteraction of their genotype (genetic code) and phenotype\n(physical expression of the genotype) with their environment.\nEnvironmental factors are considered exogenous to, and\nunaffected by, the organisms as are other populations (except\nunder biological co-evolution, as discussed below). In addi-\ntion, in biological theory the evolutionary system comprises\na population of individual elements of a particular type (i.e.\norganisms). Although this bounds the system of interest in a\nparticular way, it is important to note that such a bounding\ndecisionmay not hold special status or validity over otherways\nof bounding when applying the model to other domains.\nBounding the system of interest shapes how the processes\nand outcomes of evolution are treated. Ecosystems are not\nthe objects of study in biological evolution and there is a\nlegitimate debate to be had therefore regarding whether it is\npossible and\/or useful to treat the \u2018evolution\u2019 ofmore than one\npopulation of things as a single system, or whether insight can\nonly be gained from treating the populations individually and\nin relation to each other as separate evolutionary systems.\nWinder et al. (2005) argue that a focus on populations is\nfundamental to any evolutionary theory.\nBut what of those mechanisms which actually drive\nevolutionary change? In describing and discussing their\ncharacteristics it should be remembered that evolutionary\nmodels of socio-natural change need not be identical to those\ndeveloped to explain biological change; as long as they contain\nthe basic elements detailed by Nelson (1995), the mechanisms\nmay differ radically. For example, the mechanism for con-\ntinuity of biological system variation is genetic reproduction\nthrough which traits and structures are inherited by offspring\norganisms. In biological evolution there is no room for direct\ninheritance of acquired traits such as the ability to read (so-\ncalled Lamarckian inheritance). The creation of novel and\nextant system variation occurs through genetic recombination\nand mutation when organisms reproduce, and also through\ngene flow between populations. The primary mechanism for\nwinnowing on system variation is natural selection operating\nat the level of the individual organism, but the movement of\nindividuals through space to form new populations can also\nchange variation (for example the founder effect; Futuyma\n1986). Further winnowing mechanisms have been proposed\nfor biological evolution including group selection (Mitman\n1988; Gould 2002) and self-organization (Kauffman 1993),\nbut these are not widely accepted as part of current Neo-\nDarwinian theory. If the co-evolutionary model is to be\napplicable to the management of natural resources, then all\nthree of these mechanisms (continuity, variation creation\nand winnowing\/selection) must have corollaries in socio-\nnatural systems. However, they need not employ the same\nmechanisms as those used in biological evolution, or indeed\neachother.For example, thehuman ability towrite andpass on\nacquiredknowledge fromonegeneration to thenext indicates a\nrole for some formofLamarckian continuity and some authors\nhave incorporated Lamarckian inheritance through learning\nwithin human systems (Nelson & Winter 1982).\nCO-EVOLUTIONARYMODELS: FOUNDATIONS\nIN THE BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES\nHaving provided a general description of the properties of\nevolutionary systems, the debate can move on to consider the\nnature of co-evolution and co-evolutionary systems. The term\nco-evolution was coined by Ehrlich and Raven (1964) in their\nstudies of insect pollinator and flower morphology, and can be\ndefined as \u2018reciprocal natural selection between two or more\ngroups of organisms with close ecological relationships but\nwithout exchange of genetic information between the groups\u2019\n(Odum 1993). It is a process of reciprocal evolutionary change\nwhere the dominant traits of one species select those of the\nother and vice versa through the interaction of phenotypes\neither directly (such as with insect pollinators and flowers) or\nindirectly through some medium like a resource (for example\nbeak and food particle size in finches).\n4 P. Jeffrey and B.S. McIntosh\nIt is the co-evolution of \u2018linked lives\u2019 that has produced\nDarwin\u2019s \u2018tangled bank\u2019 of species, the multitude of forms\nand interactions that are observed in species. Attempts to\nunderstand how the various physical and circumstantial\ndriving forces ofDarwin\u2019s tangled bank interact have provided\nsome of themost insightful writing on evolutionary theory (for\nexample Thompson 1994; Coyne & Orr 2004).\nFor biological\/ecological systems, evolution and co-\nevolution involve the same types of changes, dynamics\nand processes. Co-evolution is a special (but perhaps very\npervasive) case of evolution where the focus is on reciprocal\ninfluence between evolving systems (populations). So can the\nprocesses which underlie co-evolution be characterized and\ncan this characterization help us formulate water policy?\nThe processes of co-evolution are ultimately the same\nas those underlying ecological interactions like population\nand community dynamics combined with those underlying\nevolutionary change. The following features of the units of\nchange and their environment are central to an understanding\nof co-evolutionary processes (Thompson 1994).\n\u2022 The fact that interacting species do not usually occupy\nexactly the same geographic ranges and that ranges may\nchange over time offers scope for the spread or inhibition\nof adaptations (new interactions and morphologies) over\nspace and time.\n\u2022 Environmental conditions at different locations may\ninfluence the outcome of interactions making what could\nbe a successful interaction in one location unsuccessful in\nanother.\n\u2022 Non-perfect mixing of populations over space and time\nmeans that the aggregate outcome of many individual\nto individual interactions (either within or between\nspecies) is dependent upon the way in which populations\nare distributed spatially over time, local environmental\nconditions and the role of chance.\n\u2022 Interactions that reciprocally affect fitness need not be\ncontinuous in time, nor need they occur in an exclusive\n\u2018one-to-one\u2019 interaction. It is the mutual effect on fitness\nthat is crucial. Interactions may be many but not all matter\nequally, and the extent to which particular interactions\nmatter may vary over time.\n\u2022 In non-continuous asymmetric (i.e. not one-to-one)\ninteractions there may be conflicting pressures from other\ninteractions. Under such conditions there is a recognized\nproblem in defining what constitutes reciprocal change.\nHowever, it is time to draw breath and acknowledge that\nthe deeper we delve into the minutiae of the theory, the less\nlikely we are to be able to clarify its relevance for sustainable\nnatural resources management. Thus, what are the outcomes\nof a co-evolutionary process and how can they be identified?\nWriting in the mid-20th century, authors such as Huxley\n(1942) and Rensch (1959) thought co-evolution would\nonly produce \u2018evolutionary dead-end\u2019 species too highly\nspecialized to be able to tolerate much change (Thompson\n1994). Contributions from, amongst others, Simpson (1965)\nhave changed this view and specialism (or dependency) in\ninteraction between species is now thought:\n\u2022 to evolve either slowly over time (ancient associations have\nbeen observed) or very rapidly (for example introduced\ninsects have been observed as evolving with the spread of\nmonocultured crops to highly specialized feeding forms\nwithin a few hundred years);\n\u2022 not necessarily to lead to extinction as specialist interactions\nmay provide new ways in which species may (co)evolve;\n\u2022 to potentially be a more advantageous state than generalism\ndepending on environmental conditions and how they\nchange; and\n\u2022 to potentially provide increased chances of survival and\nreproduction but possibly also make specialist species\n\u2018brittle\u2019 or incapable of adapting to environmental changes.\nAfter the extreme specialist view of co-evolution was\nabandoned, it was thought that co-evolutionary relationships\nwere either \u2018specific\u2019 (\u2018one to one\u2019) or \u2018diffuse\u2019 (\u2018one to\nmany\u2019, or \u2018many to many\u2019) and that \u2018diffuse\u2019 types were too\ntangled and complex to be understood. Indeed, co-evolution\nis thought by some biologists to occur only rarely and only\nunder relatively strong pair-wise interaction (Futuyma 1986).\nBiologists like Thompson (1994, 2001) and Fox et al. (2001)\nnow advocate a population-centred and explicitly geographic\nview half-way between evolutionary biology and ecology that\nseeks to dismantle the \u2018many to many\u2019 or \u2018one to many\u2019\nrelationships into testable hypotheses linking population and\nspecies structure and behaviour explicitlywith time and space.\nThe outcome of interactions under co-evolution is now\nviewed in terms of possibilities rather than the progressive\ndeterminism that used to be prevalent (such as the Spencerian\nview that the direction of the progression in species is caused\nby evolution). Much (all?) depends on the way in which\npopulations mix and interact over space and time, the way\nin which environmental conditions change at a local level and\nthe way in which these conditions influence the outcome of\ninteractions both within and between species.\nIn a co-evolutionary process, systems change in response to\npartly stochastic changes in each other with the consequence\nthat their direction of change is not fixed and not predictable\n(Norgaard 1994). Indeed, in biological theory, co-evolution\nhas been noted as being capable of producing either system\nstability or instability (Futuyma 1986). However, there is no\na priori way of determining whether stability or instability\nwill occur; such determinism is precluded by the role of\nstochasticity, local differences in individual interactions and\nhow these generate aggregate outcomes.\nSo co-evolution is a set of reciprocal evolutionary processes\nthatmay operate tightly (one-to-one) ormore diffusely (many-\nto-many),may change the distribution of individual characters\nwithin coevolving populations potentially leading to the\nemergence of novelty, may favour specialism or generalism in\ninteractions depending on context, may promote instability or\nstability for the interacting populations,may operate relatively\nrapidly or relatively slowly, and may exert a temporary or\nCo-evolutionary models and natural resource management 5\npermanent, local or global (i.e. species-level) effect in terms of\nadaptation. Should the co-evolutionary model be adopted as\nan adequate description, as a diagnostic tool, or as a basis\nfor prescription? If so, then are practitioners prepared to\nexpose human communities to such a diversity of possible\nfates? The evidence reported above suggests that even if\nco-evolutionary traits can be identified and managed, the\noutcomes of intervention are highly uncertain.\nAPPLYING CO-EVOLUTIONARYMODELS\nTO SOCIO-NATURAL PROCESSES\nSo what insights can be gained from an appreciation of\nbiological co-evolution in the context ofmanaging interactions\nbetween humans and their natural environment? Many\nfields of scientific enquiry have found the contributions of\nevolutionary and co-evolutionary theory attractive (see Fiorilo\n2001 on economics, Kuznar 2001 on anthropology, Briscoe\n1998 on linguistics, Dijksterhuis et al. 1999 on organizational\nscience and McWhorter 2003 on history of language). Most\nusefully in terms of a contribution to science, co-evolutionary\ntheories provide a model for understanding the relationships\nbetween disparate system types. For example Richerson et al.\n(2002) suggest that the human genetic makeup might have\nco-evolved with cultural institutions over long time periods,\nresulting in an innate psychology well adapted to living\nin cooperative societies. However, attempts to use co-\nevolutionary typemodels to understand socio-natural systems\nhave been the subject of much recent debate (McIntosh &\nJeffrey 2004; Rammel & Staudinger 2004). This paper seeks\nto take that debate forward by challenging the assumption\nthat the co-evolutionary model, as applied to socio-natural\nsystems, is fit for purpose.\nThe milieu of application for this contribution is socio-\nnatural interactions and, in particular, natural resource man-\nagement. Consequently, the following text critically reviews\na selection of recent literature concerned specifically with\nco-evolutionary understandings of socio-natural relation-\nships, the intention being to demonstrate the extent and\ninfluence of such understandings. A more comprehensive\nreview can be found in Kallis (2007).\nAguilera-Klink et al. (2000) and Funtowicz et al. (1998)\nhave used institutional analysis to illustrate the concept of co-\nevolution using, respectively, groundwater management in\nTenerife and the economic development of a town in Sicily as\ncase studies. More directly, Van Den Bergh and Stagl (2003)\nhave formulated a framework for institutional analysis itself,\nbased upon the insights of co-evolution. Van Den Bergh and\nGowdy (2000), Rammel and Staudinger (2002) and Rammel\nand Van Den Bergh (2003) have elaborated the policy and\neconomic implications for sustainable development that arise\nfrom co-evolutionary theory, focusing on aspects such as path\ndependency, lock-in and the maintenance of diversity as a\nstrategy to combat uncertainty.\nPerhaps themost influential writing on this theme however,\nhas come from Norgaard (Costanza et al. 2004) who\nimportantly suggests an alternative co-evolutionary paradigm\nfor interpreting, understanding and managing the world, in-\ncluding humans (Norgaard 1981, 1984, 1994, 1995). Norgaard\nviews the Earth as a single co-evolutionary system composed\nof a multitude of co-evolving sub-systems including the\nenvironment, human values and human knowledge. He draws\na direct analogy between the co-evolution of species with each\nother and the co-evolution of societies with ecosystems and\nthe physical (resource providing) environment. Everything\nis endogenous to this vision of socio-natural co-evolution\nincluding the abstract human realm of thought.\nThe importance of cumulative positive-feedback processes\nis emphasized frequently by Norgaard but no clear distinction\nis drawn between the functioning of these and of evolutionary\nprocesses such as selection (Tisdell 1998). Undoubtedly inter-\ndependent dynamic systemprocesses occur between social and\nenvironmental domains and are important, but perhaps amore\nfruitful focus for research concerning the co-evolutionary\nparadigm lies in:\n\u2022 improving the clarity of a classification of different kinds of\nchange (dynamic, evolutionary, co-evolutionary);\n\u2022 characterizing examples of each kind of change to\nunderstand the implications for the management and use\nof water (and more generally other natural resources); and\n\u2022 developing a clear statement of the nature and extent\n(limits, differences) of the mapping between biological\ntheory and socio-natural change.\nIf there is a universally applicable type of change that\ncan be called co-evolution, it should have a definable\nset of characteristics. The definition provided by Nelson\n(1995) provides a minimum set of criteria and a language\nfor expressing evolutionary or co-evolutionary phenomena,\nhowever there is a gap between Nelson\u2019s definition and an\noperationally useful framework for studying socio-natural\nprocesses as a co-evolutionary system.\nIt is not always easy to understand what is meant by\nthe term \u2018evolution\u2019 outside of biology, and the meaning is\noften conflated with dynamics in these areas (Klu\u00a8ver 2002).\nWe believe that this is the current case within socio-natural\nresearch. There is no consistent framework for researching\nco-evolution, although there does appear to be an emerging\nconsensus over the implications of characterizing a system\nas co-evolutionary for policy and sustainability. Typical\nimplications discussed within the literature include risk,\nuncertainty, path dependency, lock-in, the need to promote\nadaptivity and problems with policies based on optimization\nand equilibrium assumptions. Carts and horses come tomind,\nas a consensus on outputs from the co-evolutionary model\n(i.e. what it generates as plausible research issues) is emerging\nbefore a consensus on model verification and potential benefit\nhas been demonstrated.\nSo why should a co-evolutionary perspective be privileged\nover other perspectives? In particular what differentiates co-\nevolution from complex systems? The importance of appreci-\nating complexity is already well-established. What additional\n6 P. Jeffrey and B.S. McIntosh\nbenefit does co-evolution bring to bear on understandings and\nmanagement of human-environment interactions? At present\nthe answer is unclear. There is a lack of satisfactory and\nconsistent application of the co-evolutionary framework to\nreal-life cases and problems, despitemore than 20 years having\ntranspired since Norgaard\u2019s (1981) original work.\nAPPLYING THE CO-EVOLUTIONARYMODEL\nTO SOCIO-NATURAL SYSTEMS: FRACTURES\nIN THE ANALOGY\nThere are some specific shortcomings of transferring the co-\nevolutionarymodel across disciplines and fields of application,\nalthough these do not relate to the application of evolutionary\nor co-evolutionary theory within their homelands of biology\nand ecology. The frailties described below are associated with\nattempts to formally transfer the models to other fields of\nenquiry. Failure to address such points of departure could, by\ndefault, allow undue authority and credence to be associated\nwith use of the model outside the remit of biological systems.\nThe translation of the co-evolutionary model to non-\nbiological contexts raises a number of points of debate, several\nof which have been rehearsed in the foregoing pages. Our\nprincipal concerns can be summarized under the following\nfive headings.\n(1) Specification of suitable populations between\nwhich co-evolutionary relationships might operate\nWhere are the multiple instances of a species which can be\nselected on and winnowed? Is it meaningful to talk about\na population of rivers, of land uses or of households? Which\npopulations exhibit co-evolutionary change, andwhich exhibit\nstate-based dynamic change only? Can a population of rivers\n\u2018evolve\u2019 and if so in what sense? Or is there an alternative\nway of framing co-evolution? How should co-evolution be\nbounded and characterized?\n(2) Identification of salient or influential\nco-evolutionary attributes amongst the set of all\nattributes which an entity might possess\nCo-evolution typically explains the impact of just one attribute\nof an entity. This might be an important attribute and a\nkey determinant of survival potential. However, given the\ndebate in the biological sciences about the significance and\nidentification of co-evolutionary relationships, it may be\nrelevant to also question whether co-evolutionary processes\nare only of interest where an intense relationship which might\nresult in \u2018lock in\u2019 or specialization can be identified.\n(3) The possibility that the attributes of significance\nmight be intangible\nWhilst natural systems have tangible attribute states, other\ntypes of systemmighthave intangible or elusive states, perhaps\nonly expressed as the aggregate outcome over time of the\nperceptions, intentions and actions of the actors involved.\nOther forms of interaction may also be occurring in addition\nto those which might be classified as co-evolutionary; can\nco-evolutionary interactions be identified through the noise\ncreated by the others? Importantly, can state-based dynamic\nchange be distinguished from evolutionary change?\n(4) Lack of evidence that evolutionary and\nco-evolutionary processes can be harnessed for the\nbenefit of one particular group\nEvolutionary processes have no utility function guiding them.\nThe only beneficiary appears to be life itself with individuals\nand sometimes species being lost simply because they are\npoorly suited to existing circumstances; does society really\nwant this form of dynamic to inform its approach to socio-\nnatural interactions? (This interpretation has recently been\npointed out in the context of the global high-tech economy as\nan emerging ecologywith nomorals and no objective function;\nReich 2001.)\n(5) The status of evolutionary theory as having\ndescriptive power but little predictive\nor prescriptive potential\nIn adopting the co-evolutionary model the research\ncommunity may be encumbered by its epistemological\nstanding in that it may simply help to explain what has\nhappened and allow us to characterize and classify processes,\nto understand what has happened after the fact.\nPROGRESSING THE CO-EVOLUTIONARYMODEL\nThe challenge is to take some practical steps towards\ndetermining whether a single, generalized definition of co-\nevolutionary change can be distilled and applied to the study\nand management of socio-natural interactions. If we, as a\nresearch community, cannot provide and agree upon a single\ndefinition (however abstract) of what constitutes co-evolution\n(as opposed to other types of change) regardless of application\narea, then we are not talking about the same type of change\nand arguably should not be using the same set of labels.\nTo address the issue of how different kinds of change\nare labelled requires a consideration of not only the co-\nevolutionary model itself, but also of how its substantive\nmeaning has beenmapped across application domains; to what\nextent is it acceptable to change the meaning of a conceptual\nstructure as it is transferred betweendisciplines?Atwhat point\n(if any) should different labels be used, andmore importantly,\nat what point should it be acknowledged that the model is\ninaccurate or its usefulness compromised? In creating adiverse\narray of meanings for a single set of conceptual labels the\ndanger arises of diluting and eventually losing the original\ninsight, or heuristic device. Transferring concepts between\nfields of application is a tricky business, and should be pursued\nwith caution.\nCo-evolutionary models and natural resource management 7\nTable 1 An evolutionary description of regional water use and management.

If there are no humans LU would revert to\nnatural vegetation. In addition there are human and environmental constraints on\nwhether LU can change at all, and if it can, how quickly\nHouseholds need water for a range of basic uses for human survival. Social resistance to water\npricing for basic services could leading to continued water use behaviour. In addition,\nhouseholds may change supply option if the current option ceases to be economically viable\nIn broad agreement with Winder et al. (2005), we propose\nthat co-evolution, as a type of change, is manifest through\npopulations of discrete, observable entities, individuals or\nthings; it is distinct from (simple or complex) dynamic or\n(merely) evolutionary change. Abstract theorising has allowed\nthe development of concepts anddefinition of units of analysis,\nbut it is now time to populate this view of co-evolution\nwith some practical examples as a means of determining its\napplicability and utility (about which we make no a priori\njudgements) as a basis for management. The phenomena\nto be studied must be bounded in operational terms so\nthat we can explore and understand relationships between\nelements and between separate systems in terms of attributes,\nprocesses and mechanisms. The following section documents\na process designed to progress the application of the co-\nevolutionary model outside biology and ecology through\nfacilitating structured and principled exploration.\nA CO-EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE\nONWATERMANAGEMENT\nA significant problem in applying co-evolutionary interpret-\nations to an issue as complex as water management (or\nother areas of natural resource management) is the sheer\nmagnitude of coupled processes which require consideration.\nThe classes of phenomena generally denoted as being\nof relevance to socio-natural co-evolution conform to the\nclassification typically adopted by \u2018integrative\u2019 research\nagendas; these are sets of structures and processes which\nexhibit economic, social, technological, environmental and\npolitical features. Although this classification scheme appears\ninstinctively useful (conflicts between sets conforming to\npopular representations of the tensions which characterize\ncontemporary natural resource management challenges),\nthere is no reason (in the metaphysical sense) why co-\nevolutionary models should in principle fall in line with other\nways of classifying and structuring the problem. Indeed the\ndifficulties in knowing \u2018where to look\u2019 for co-evolution are\nmanifest in the evolutionary and co-evolutionary descriptions\nof regional water use and management (Tables 1 and 2,\ndiscussed below). Bounding the phenomena of interest in\ndifferent ways yields different system perspectives which may\nvary in the degree to which they can be said to exhibit the\npotential for evolutionary or co-evolutionary change.\nIn addition, there is a balance to be struck in the search for\nsocio-natural co-evolution between looking for and analysing\n8 P. Jeffrey and B.S. McIntosh\nTable 2 A co-evolutionary description of regional water use and management. LU = Land use.\nElement type Example\nA potential co-evolutionary sequence\nof change\nSpatially diffuse urbanization creates a significant centralized water supply investment cost.\nMany domestic customers instead opt to invest in lower cost small-scale water supply\ntechnologies (rainwater, boreholes). Consequent price increases induce increasing numbers\nto invest in similar technologies. Such customers become locked in to their investments and\nunwilling to reconnect to centralized service, making additional centralized investment\nfinancially unattractive. This in turn limits increases in urban density, which, for health\nreasons requires centrally managed water and wastewater service provision. The region\nbecomes locked into a diffuse urban LU pattern with a decentralized technological regime\nNature of the pair-wise interactions\nbetween systems (mechanism\nand scope)\nSpatial and temporal water demand depends on the distribution of LU types. LU change\nprocesses may result in a change in the number and composition of housing stock, and in\nthe types of inhabitants expected to occupy each house. Changes in inhabitants may change\ndomestic water-use behaviours. These processes have the potential to affect variation in\nwater demand (how much, when, in what quality, at what location and through what\nmeans) by households.\nAs domestic water use changes it may impact on the availability of raw or piped water. As\nwater levels decrease the LU possibilities for affected parcels of land may be reduced, for\nexample particular types of agriculture may no longer be viable. Given that public supply\nof water typically has priority over other uses, changes in domestic water use might\nconstrain and influence regional LU patterns through selecting against particular LU types\noccurring in particular land parcels\nEffect of the pair-wise interactions\non variation within each system\nLU change plays a role in setting the bounds of domestic water use through setting the\nnumber, composition and location of housing (if dense housing is planned then gardens\nwill be small, restricting water demand for those houses)\nDomestic water use varying across a region may influence the set of possible LU cover types\nfor different land parcels if water availability is restricted. If however water is abundant as\na raw and piped resource, then there is likely to be little direct influence from water demand\nto LU\npair-wise interactions like the classical biological flower\u2013\npollinator example, and casting the net of analysis too wide\nin the hope of capturing some evidence of co-evolutionary\ndynamic. With the former approach, key influences may\nbe ignored which qualitatively change potentially co-\nevolutionary relationships, and with the latter approach co-\nevolutionary effects may appear ubiquitous and hopelessly\nentangled. Biological co-evolutionary research has tried both\napproaches over the past decades. An initially pair-wise\napproachwhich is subsequently expanded in scope as required\nis now recommended (Thompson 1994).\nIt is our position that difficulties in bounding the natural\nresource management \u2018system\u2019 under examination increases\nthe need for a structured process to guide the application\nof the co-evolutionary model. Such a process should ensure\nthat (1) evidence for co-evolution does not arise simply as a\nconsequence of selectively viewing a complex, interconnected,\nmulti-scale set of substantive issues, and (2) management\naction is based upon empirical evidence gathered and analysed\nin a defensible manner. We will now describe a process which\nprovides structure to applying the co-evolutionary model to\nnatural resource management.\nGiven that co-evolutionary systems are essentially\nreciprocally interacting evolutionary systems, the first task\nis to identify potentially evolving (sub-)systems that interact\nin a potentially reciprocal manner. Little general guidance\ncan be given regarding the initial identification of interacting\n(sub-)systems (these should follow from the literature,\nfrom policy or management documentation, etc.), but once\nidentified each (sub-)system should be described with\nreference to the features identified by Nelson (1995):\n\u2022 the variables or attributes for consideration in the system\nof interest,\n\u2022 a way of characterizing variation within the variables or\nattributes selected,\n\u2022 one or more mechanisms through which variation can be\ngenerated or renewed in the variables or attributes selected,\n\u2022 one or more mechanisms for winnowing variation in the\nvariables or attributes selected, and\n\u2022 one or more mechanisms for providing continuity for\nvariation in the variables\/attributes selected.\nThis list of elements constitutes an evolutionary description\nof the system concerned and for our purposes provides a\ndefinition of an evolutionary process. The mechanisms by\nwhich variation can be generated or winnowed or continue,\nconstitute a description of at least some of the ways in which\nthe system may evolve. If the list of elements cannot be\narticulated in its entirety, it is difficult to see how any claim\nregarding the operation of co-evolution can be made. There\nis considerable scope however for articulating each element in\ndifferent ways as appropriate for the phenomena under study.\nTo illustrate this part of the process, we provide a\ndescription of two aspects of water resource use and\nCo-evolutionary models and natural resource management 9\nmanagement at a regional scale using these elements (Table 1).\nThe need to consider land and water in an integrated manner\nfor policy and management purposes is now recognized both\nin literature (Geerlings & Stead 2003; Slater et al. 2004; Carter\net al. 2005) and legislation such as the EU Water Framework\nDirective.\nThe distribution of different land uses across a region\nand the way in which they change over time will influence\nwater resource availability within that region, with potentially\ndifferent demand profiles (quantities and qualities of water\nused over time) associated with each use. Given a finite\nregional water resource constraint with a particular spatial\nand temporal distribution, there are limits to the amount of\nraw water available for abstraction and use, and therefore\nlimits to the possible distribution and intensity of land uses\nwithin a region. These limits may be extended through the\nuse of water supply technologies like grey-water recycling\nthat extract more use per unit of raw water, through co-\nordinated supply and sewage treatment systemswhich abstract\nwater downstream from major sewage discharge locations,\nor through forms of demand management instrument\nlike pricing, metering or education which reduce water\nconsumption. Alternatively these limits may be reached more\nquickly if demand rises through the spread of land uses\nwith high water demand like housing with swimming pools\nor irrigation-demanding agriculture, through unregulated\nabstraction (no control over location, timing or volume) or\na lack of coordination in abstraction so that river abstraction\npoints are not necessarily sited downstream of sewage\ndischarge locations.\nMight land-use change influence variation in water use, and\nreciprocally, might changes in water use influence variation\nin land use? Are there any co-evolutionary interactions that\nshould be reflected in integrated land and water policy or\nmanagement action? For example, how should expansion in\nhousing (urban land use) into rural areas be planned in terms\nof location, timing and density to ensure a sustainable water\nsupply?\nTable 1 is in effect two evolutionary descriptions presented\ntogether, namely one for land use and one for domestic water\nuse, both at a regional scale. It is not the only possible\nperspective on, or description of, the interactions between\nland and water, but one which is of interest with respect to\nunderstanding the relationships between land-use change and\nwater use.All elements of the evolutionarydescription for each\n(sub-) system could be completed indicating that it is possible\nto frame each one in evolutionary terms. Now the question\nis, does each (sub-)system at least partially drive evolutionary\nchange in the other?\nThe co-evolutionary dynamic can be focused on by\nundertaking the following tasks:\n\u2022 characterizing a potential sequence of interactions between\nthe systems that results in reciprocal evolutionary change,\n\u2022 using the potential sequence as a starting point, identifying\nthe nature of the interaction between the two systems as to\ninteraction mechanism or process and scope of interaction\n(i.e. for each system does the interaction operate identically\nacross the range of extant variation or are there geographic,\nsocial, temporal or some other differences that may affect\nthe outcome?), and\n\u2022 for both systems (from land-use change to domestic water\nuse and reciprocally, from water use to land-use change),\nidentifying how the process of interaction either generates\nvariation or selects for or against particular variations or\nconfigurations and in doing so directs system evolution.\nThe method described above reflects Thompson\u2019s (1994)\nsuggestion to analyse pair-wise interactions as a means of\napproaching more entangled multiple system co-evolution if\nthe issues are overwhelming.\nContinuing the example (Table 1), we provide a\nco-evolutionary description of regional water use and\nmanagement (Table 2). Although both land-use change and\ndomestic water use show the potential for evolutionary change\n(as defined by Nelson), and both interact and influence each\nother, the nature of this interaction is unclear and mediated.\nWater use has the potential to act as a winnowing process for\nland-use through reducing availability (either in the natural\nenvironment or within supply infrastructures). However this\nis only likely to occur under conditions of high demand and\/or\nlow resource availability.\nLand-use change has the potential to influence variation in\nthe range of possible supply options considered domestically.\nThe processes underlying land-use change will determine the\nnumber, type and location of housing within a region and\nin doing so set bounds on the possible variation of domestic\nwater use both in terms of demand levels and supply options.\nThere is a possibility that diffuse housing expansion may\nfinancially influence domestic customers to opt for alternative\nnon-networked supply options depending on price (Table 2).\nHowever the mechanisms which generate, winnow and\nprovide continuity for variation in either land use or\ndomestic water use are more directly related to the economics\nof water supply and consumption, demographic change,\nregional economic change and governance and regulation\narrangements. This reflects the problem of bounding explored\nat the start of this section, which is inherent to socio-natural\ninvestigation; where do you (not) look to find evidence of\nco-evolution?\nDespite it being likely that there will be an associative\nrelationship between inhabitants, types of houses and types\nof water-use behaviour, water demand is a direct function of\nthe behaviour of the inhabitants of houses, not of the houses (or\nthe land-use types) themselves.As inhabitants change through\ndemographic, socio-economic and technological processes, so\nwill variation in domestic water use regionally. Given this,\nwhere is the co-evolution? One is left with the impression\nthat there might be co-evolution at work, but it is difficult to\npin-point in process or effect.\nTo summarize, our suggested procedure for the\nidentification of socio-natural co-evolutionary processes is as\n10 P. Jeffrey and B.S. McIntosh\nfollows: (1) identify the evolutionary (sub-)systems\/entities,\n(2) provide a characterization of variation in each system,\n(3) identify the mechanisms that generate, winnow and\nprovide continuity for variation in each system, (4) describe\none or more potential sequences of reciprocal change that\nresult in an evolutionary change in one or more systems,\n(5) identify possible reciprocal interaction(s) between each\nsystem in terms of interaction mechanism\/process and scope\nof interaction, and (6) identify the effect of the reciprocal\ninteraction(s) on each system in terms of generating variation,\nselecting for or against particular variations (directional\nselection).\nThis six-point procedure can in our opinion act as a device\nfor structuring thinking about the presence and nature of\nco-evolutionary change. If it is not possible to describe the\ntarget domain in this way, then either the investigator does\nnot possess a sufficiently clear picture of the domain in terms\nof the elements, relationships and processes within it, or\nthere are genuine difficulties in framing the domain in co-\nevolutionary terms. Whilst the procedure described does not\nconstitute a critical test for the existence of \u2018co-evolutionary\u2013\nlike\u2019 processes (as framed above), an inability to describe a\ntarget domain using the procedure may indicate that changes\nin the domain cannot be adequately or usefully described in\nco-evolutionary terms. In either case, further investigation\nwill be required.\nA formal comparison between a co-evolutionary interpreta-\ntion of socio-natural interactions and other watermanagement\nmodels is beyond the scope of this investigation. However,\nit should be noted that there are substantive ontological\ndifferences between many contemporary approaches to\nmanaging water resources. For example, whilst integrated\nwater resources management (Jonker 2002) advocates the\nbenefits of joined-up planning and intervention between\nsectors and amongst governance bodies, adaptivemanagement\n(Walters 1986) endorses a particular style of management\nfounded on experiment and learning. Contrastingly, the co-\nevolutionary model is an epistemological tool, a way of\nunderstanding change (that may or may not generate insights\nwhich can be exploited for management) rather than a way of\nmanaging change. Direct comparisons are thereby of limited\nvalue. The reader might usefully refer to recent work by De\nGroot and Lenders (2006) for a recent survey of approaches\nto water management.\nThe value of identifying and understanding the\ncharacteristics of co-evolutionary relationships for water\npolicy development will be a function of the status of the\ninsights gained and the availability of appropriate policy\nmechanisms. In particular, the extent towhich newknowledge\ncan be exploitedwill be determined by the confidence in taking\nlessons from one point in space and time and using them at\nother points. This case specificity of actionable knowledge\nplagues other contemporary approaches to water management\nand raises issues of policy legitimacy as well as science-society\nrelationships. A co-evolutionary perspective also embraces the\npossibility that appropriate responses to water problems may\nbe found outside of the water sector; thereby creating niches\nfor new policy tools and confirming the relevance of integrated\nwater resource management as a policy framework.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe search for suitable models with which to understand\nand manage socio-natural interactions presents a significant\nchallenge to both research and practitioner communities,\ninvolving the synthesis of appropriate knowledge from a broad\nrange of natural and social sciences. As part of this activity,\ntheories of evolution and co-evolution have been transferred\nfrom the biological and ecological sciences to address a range\nof issues from the global relationship between society and the\nenvironment to more specific issues concerning institutional\ndevelopment, economicpolicy and response to climate change.\nMuch of this transfer and application has been conducted in\namanner that tends only to reinforce the alreadywell-accepted\nview that socio-natural processes are complex, interwoven,\ndynamic and inherently uncertain in trajectory. Precious little\nin termsof practical advice onhow to formulate policyhas been\nproducedby researchers engaged in transferring such theories.\nFurther, several fractures can be detected in the analogy being\nmade between socio-natural co-evolution and biological co-\nevolution. A change in focus and direction is required to\nmaintain those insights from co-evolutionary theory which\nare of genuine assistance in making the understanding of\nsocio-natural processesmore acute, accurate andmore directly\nrelevant to sustainable natural resource management.\nPerhaps the analysis presented in this paper could be\ncharged with taking the co-evolutionary analogy too literally,\nof missing the spirit of the original insight by pedantically\nscrutinizing itsmeaning.However, in drawing attention to the\nimplications of imprecise or hasty transfer of models between\nphenomena, we seek to review the utility or relevance of the\ninsight, and to move beyond the enthusiasm of revelation and\ntake a more critical view of the claims made. It is also true\nthat, in its homeland of biology, the field of co-evolutionary\ndynamics is itself not static. For example, recent advances have\nemphasized the role of metapopulations in geographically-\nstructured co-evolution (Thompson 1999; Thompson et al.\n2002). Whilst these developments are potentially useful in the\ncontext of natural resourcesmanagement, we argue that unless\na \u2018simple\u2019 version of the model is demonstrably applicable,\nembellishments of it are unlikely to hold much water.\nWe advocate that the research community move beyond a\nconsideration of the complex implications of co-evolutionary\nprocesses to the establishment of a firm, process-based\ndefinition of co-evolution as a type of change. We further\nargue that research is required to establish whether a\ncommon conceptual definition of co-evolution can be used\nto structure research and inform management across the\nmultiple substantive domains (such as hydrology, technology,\nsociology and economics) that are the components of this\nparticular socio-natural system. It is too early to say whether\nsuch a definition can be formulated, agreed upon and used,\nCo-evolutionary models and natural resource management 11\nbut it is apparent that the current situation of conceptual\ndiversity may hinder communication and development over\nthe coming years. Having many meanings for the same labels\ncan be counter-productive. The procedure presented above\nfor describing evolutionary and co-evolutionary systems will\nestablishwhether the co-evolutionarymodel has relevance and\nutility to water resources management.\nHowever, before concluding, it is appropriate to turn to the\nquestion of whether a complexity-embracing, co-evolutionary\napproach contribute to questions of policy? The utility of\ntaking a co-evolutionary perspective on water management\nissues is yet to be clearly demonstrated. In tandem with\nthis challenge, both researchers and practitioners need to\nthink more generally about the contribution that this kind\nof explanation can make. After all, evolutionary theories are\nrecognized as being good for explaining past events but poor\nfor predicting and planning future events (Costanza 2003).\nThis question draws attention to a major criticism of a co-\nevolutionary perspective on any policy issue;. that it is of little\npractical use for prescription or intervention.\nOur response to this query is informed by Nelson (1995),\nwho, commenting on the evolutionary theory of the law, stated\nthat: \u2018One might argue that [the limited predictive power and\nthe ad hoc partiality of the theory] would seem to be a big\nstrike against it. On the other hand one can argue that the\nillumination of the complex contingent processes bywhich the\nlaw evolves is a strength of the theory. Such an analysis reveals\nthe apparent strong predictive power of a simpler theory\nto be fool\u2019s gold\u2019. We partially concur with this conclusion\nregardless of the (so far) undemonstrated practical utility of\nco-evolutionary theory (see, however, Sotarauta & Srinivas\n2006, for a recent example of how the label \u2018co-evolutionary\u2019\nhas been more sensitively and in our view more appropriately\nused). Exploring sustainable water management from a co-\nevolutionary perspective has, if nothing else, focused attention\non the tension between the need to capture a tractable\nunderstanding of the world as a basis for management versus\na complex, unpredictable and uncertain reality. We argue\nthat limited predictive power and ad hoc partiality, combined\nwith the second-hand nature of the overarching theoretical\nstructure, should provoke a cautious approach to use.\nAnd lest the significance of a commitment to the\nco-evolutionary model be underestimated, it should be\nremembered that the specifics of policy and intervention\nare premised on a particular understanding of how the\nworld works. If the system is believed to behave like a\nclock, approaches to exploiting system functionality must be\ncommensurate with a belief in the system behaving like a\nclock, which necessarily limits the type of utility which can\nbe extracted from the system. Unfortunately, the question\nof how credible a particular interpretation of how the world\nworks needs to be before we base our actions on it, is rarely\naddressed, thereby providing much opportunity for theory\ngeneration and little time for theory evaluation before the next\nbig idea comes round. Whether or not the co-evolutionary\nmodel provides a robust interpretation and\/or yields tangible\npractical benefits remains to be seen. But in prompting a\ndialogue on howwe exploit understandings to benefit progress\nit illuminates the dynamic between knowledge generation and\nknowledge use which characterizesmuch of the contemporary\nrelationship between science and society.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe development of this paper has benefited from the\ncomments of reviewers and discussions with a number of\ncolleagues, prominent amongstwhichhavebeenNickWinder,\nRoger Seaton, TimOxley and JamieMcGlade.
