For\nexample, the chemical composition, surface energy, semi-\nconductor properties and surface charge play important\nroles. Laser surface processing has proven to be a\ncontrollable and \u00afexible technique for modifying the\nsurface properties of biomaterials, e.g. laser treatments\nsuch as patterning and microfabrication [2, 3], pulsed-\nlaser deposition of biocompatible ceramics [4\u00b18],\nimproving the surface corrosion of biometals [9\u00b111] and\n59\nB03503 # IMechE 2004 Proc.

In previous\nwork concerned with biomaterials, a CO2 pulsed laser\nwas used to graft a biopolymer [13] and a biorubber\n[14] for the purpose of improved surface hydrophilicity,\nand to cause the change in the wettability of a polyethy-\nlene terephthalate (PET) surface. Moreover, Lawrence\nand Li [15] compared the e\u0080 ects of a CO2 laser, a Nd-\ndoped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) laser, an\nexcimer laser and a high-power diode laser (HPDL) on\nthe wettability characteristics of polymethyl methacry-\nlate (PMMA), a biopolymer, and found that the various\nlaser beams caused di\u0080 erent changes in the wetttability\ncharacteristics. In addition, there have been many inves-\ntigations into the application of laser radiation to alter\nthe wettability characteristics of many materials.\nLawrence and Li showed that laser surface processing\na\u0080 ected the surface energy of metals [16, 17]. Likewise,\nmuch work showed that excimer radiation a\u0080 ected the\nwettability characteristics of PET [18\u00b120], polyparaphe-\nnylene terethalamide (PPTA) [21] and polyether\u00b1ether\u00b1\nketone (PEEK) [22, 23] and enhanced the coating adhe-\nsion of metals [24, 25]. The existing work is concerned\npredominantly with polymers and metals, and no work\nhas hitherto been conducted on the laser processing of\nthe bioinert ceramics.\nHowever, it is recognized in the small amount of\npertinent literature that the use of laser radiation for\nthe modifying the wettability characteristics of engineer-\ning ceramics materials is feasible. Lawrence and Li [26]\nhave shown that the texturing of ceramics (with an\nexcimer laser at 248 nm) can enhance the adhesion\nstrength. Moreover, Lawrence and co-workers found\nthat HPDL treatment of the SiO2\u00b1Al2O3 basic ceramic\n(ceramic tile) [26], the SiO2\u00b1Al2O3\u00b1Fe2O3-based ceramic\n(clay quarry tile) and Al2O3 and SiO2\u00b1TiO2 [27] resulted\nin an improvement in the wettability characteristics. The\nalterations in the surface roughness, the surface O\ncontent and polar component of surface energy were\nfound to be the mechanisms active in modi\u00aecation of\nwettability. Further study [28] showed that the surface\nenergy is the most predominant factor governing the\nwetting characteristics of the SiO2\u00b1Al2O3-based ceramic.\nIn work, Hao and Lawrence [29] proved the ability of\nlaser surface treatment to modify the wettability charac-\nteristics of the magnesia partially stabilized zirconia\n(MgO-PSZ) and thereby achieved a favourable cell\nattachment on the modi\u00aeed MgO-PSZ [30].\nThis work investigates the basic phenomena and\nwetting mechanisms associated with CO2 laser proces-\nsing of MgO-PSZ, the widely used bioinert ceramic\nwith high mechanical strength and excellent corrosion\nresistance. Contact angles of a set of liquids are used to\nmeasure the wettability characteristics and to calculate\nthe surface energy of the MgO-PSZ before and after\nCO2 laser surface treatment. The relationship between\nthe CO2 laser-induced microstructures and wettability\ncharacteristics of the MgO-PSZ was analysed.\n2 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES\n2.1 Material speci\u00aecations\nThe material under investigation was a 4 per cent MgO-\nPSZ. The material was obtained in sheet form with\ndimensions 50mm\u00a3 50mm\u00a3 2.15mm (Goodfellow\nLimited) but, for experimental convenience, it was cut\ninto blocks of 50mm\u00a3 12mm\u00a3 2.15mm with a dia-\nmond blade cutter. The material was used as received\nprior to laser treatment.\n2.2 Laser experimental arrangement\nA 3 kW CO2 laser emitting with a wavelength of 10.6mm\nwas used in this study. The laser produced a transverse\nelectromagnetic mode (TEM01) beam and was operated\nin the continuous-wave mode. Figure 1 illustrates the\nfull arrangement complete with the \u00aeve-axis workstation\n(Trumpf, Limited). As can be seen, a series of optical\nunits are used to deliver the CO2 laser unit to the stage\nthrough the laser head, which is positioned by means\nof two linear axes ( y and z axes) and two rotary axes\n(b and c axes). The defocused CO2 laser beam was \u00aered\nand traversed across the surface of the MgO-PSZ\nsamples placed on the stage using the x axis. The\ndefocused laser beam with 11mm spot diameter was\npassed over the surface of the specimen single time.\nThe fumes produced were removed with an extraction\nsystem, while O2 process gas at a pressure of 2 bar was\nused to shield the laser optics and to assist the surface\ntreatment.\n2.3 Wettability characteristics analysis procedure\nTo investigate the e\u0080 ects of laser radiation on the wetting\nand surface energy characteristics of the MgO-PSZ, a set\nof sessile drop control experiments were carried out using\nglycerol, formamide, ethane glycol, polyglycol E-200 and\npolyglycol 15-200. The test liquids, together with their\ntotal surface energies \u00aelv, dispersive component values\n\u00aedlv and polar component values \u00ae\np\nlv [31] are detailed in\nTable 1.\nThe contact angles of the test liquids on the untreated\nand CO2-laser-treated MgO-PSZ were determined in\natmospheric conditions at 25 8C using a sessile drop\nmeasure machine (Fist Ten A\u00ca ngstroms, Inc.). In order\nto estimate the in\u00afuence of contaminant layers on the\nmeasurement results, the specimens of the untreated\nMgO-PSZ were cleaned with acetone in an ultrasonic\n60 L HAO AND J LAWRENCE\nProc. Instn Mech. Engrs Vol. 218 Part B: J. Engineering Manufacture B03503 # IMechE\nbath for 2 h, rinsed with distilled water several times and\ndried in a vacuum oven at 90 8C for 12h. The test liquids\nwere used to measure the contact angle for the cleaned\nsample. It was observed that the value of the contact\nangles on the cleaned sample are 1.5, 1.2, 1.0, 0.9 and\n0.88 for glycerol, formamide, ethane glycol, polyglycol\nE-200 and polyglycol 15-200 respectively, lower than\nthat of the received sample without the cleaning. It is\nassumed that the contaminant on the surface of the\nMgO-PSZ has only a slight in\u00afuence on the value of\ncontact angle. Since the contaminant is a minor factor\nactive in the wettability characterization, it is\nreasonable to omit cleaning pre-treatment for practical\napplication of laser treatment. In order to explore the\npotential of laser treatment as an industrial and\neconomical processing for altering the wettability of\nMgO-PSZ, the current research is conducted on atmos-\npheric environment without pre-cleaning. The results\non the contact angle were obtained using the average\nvalues of \u00aeve measurements for one sample that were\nmeasured immediately after laser treatment. Each\nmeasurement of contact angle lasted for 3min with\npro\u00aele photographs of the sessile drop being obtained\nevery minute and a subsequently determined. After a\ntest liquid drop of average volume 9 ml attached and\nrested on the MgO-PSZ surface, the drops consistently\nreached an equilibrium state in around 6 s. Thereafter\nthey remained motionless and the magnitude of the con-\ntact angle changed little with time. On average, only\n\u00a70.58 deviation in the contact angle for each test liquid\nwas observed during the 3min measurement when time\nphotographs were taken every minute, indicating that\nthe shape of the drop was stable in its equilibrium\nstate. As can be seen later from Fig. 5a, the di\u0080 erence\nbetween the contact angle values on the left-hand side\nand the right-hand side of the sessile drop is very small,\njust 0.68, which generates \u00a70.38 deviation. In turn, the\naverage total deviation for the contact angle measure-\nment will be \u00a70.88.\n3 THE ANALYSIS OF CO2 LASER-INDUCED\nSOLIDIFICATION MICROSTRUCTURE ON\nTHE MgO-PSZ\nThe major e\u0080 ects of varying the thermal conditions on\nsolidi\u00aecation microstructure are well known according\nto the theory of constitutional supercooling at low\nsolidi\u00aecation rates and morphological stability theory\nat high solidi\u00aecation rates [32]. The extent of the zone\nof constitutional supercooling depends upon the opera-\ntive solidi\u00aecation parameters, i.e. the solidi\u00aecation rate\nR and thermal gradient G. Increasing the gradient-rate\nratio G\/R causes a progressive change in the solidi\u00aeca-\ntion characteristics, ranging from fully dendritic to\ncellular dendritic to cellular and \u00aenally to planar front\nFig. 1 Schematic diagram of the experimental set-up for the CO2 laser surface treatment of the MgO-PSZ\nTable 1 Total surface energies \u00aelv and their dispersive compo-\nnents \u00aedlv and polar components \u00ae\np\nlv for the selected\ntest liquids [30]\nLiquid\n\u00aelv\n(mJ\/m2)\n\u00aedlv\n(mJ\/m2)\n\u00aeplv\n(mJ\/m2)\nGlycerol 64.0 34 30\nFormamide 58.3 32.3 26.0\nEthene glycol 48.3 29.3 19.0\nPolyglycol E-200 43.5 28.2 15.3\nPolyglycol 15-200 36.6 26.0 10.6\nON THE ROLE OF LASER-INDUCED MICROSTRUCTURES IN INFLUENCING THE SURFACE ENERGY 61\nB03503 # IMechE 2004 Proc.

When the threshold of planar interface stability\nis exceeded a cellular interface is formed but, before any\nsuch cell structure is formed, several di\u0080 erent stages have\nto be undergone [33]. When the degree of constitutional\nsupercooling is small, i.e. G\/R is slightly less than that\nrequired for stability, the interface develops small\nirregularities; however, no de\u00aenite structure is present.\nIncreasing the degree of constitutional supercooling\nleads to the formation of \u00aene elongated cells at the inter-\nface. On further increasing the degree of constitutional\nsupercooling, the capped-hexagonal formation becomes\nthe stable interface shape. Finally, when marked consti-\ntutional supercooling exists, the cellular shape is\ndeveloped. At even larger supercooling (G\/R becomes\neven smaller), a transient from the cellular into cellular\ndendritic interface will occur [34].\nFig. 2 Examination of the microstructure produced in the laser track: (a) schematic depiction of the area of\nthe laser track analysed; (b)\u00b1(d) surface optical images of the microstructures (b-1), (b-2) at the centre,\n(c) at the midway point and (d) at the edge of the laser track (with a power density of 2.5 kW\/cm2 and a\ntraverse speed of 2000mm\/min)\n62 L HAO AND J LAWRENCE\nProc. Instn Mech. Engrs Vol. 218 Part B: J. Engineering Manufacture B03503 # IMechE 2004\n3.1 Solidi\u00aecation microstructure analysis\nVariations in the CO2 operating parameters (power\ndensity and traverse speed) were seen to e\u0080 ect signi\u00ae-\ncantly the microstructure obtained within the laser-\ntreated areas on the MgO-PSZ surface. The surface\nmicrostructures were examined using optical micro-\nscopy. All microstructural features observed from the\nsurface view were evaluated without metallographic\npolishing or etching. High heat input from a laser\nbeam to melt a localized area on the surface sample\ncan achieve high cooling rates; the cooling rate will be\ndi\u0080 erent from the centre to the edge of sample and\ncause di\u0080 erent microstructures. Therefore, the micro-\nstructures obtained in di\u0080 erent regions of the laser\ntrack may explain the e\u0080 ect of laser-induced solidi\u00aeca-\ntion microstructure.\n3.2 Microstructures induced by a relatively high power\ndensity\nFigure 2a depicts schematically the regions analysed\noptically. One laser track was treated with a relatively\nhigh power density of 2.5kW\/cm2 under a traverse\nspeed of 2000mm\/min. As can be seen, di\u0080 erent solidi-\n\u00aeed microstructures were observed in the di\u0080 erent\nregions, in the centre (Figs 2b-1 and b-2), at the\nmidway point (Fig. 2c) and at the edge (Fig. 2d) of the\nCO2-laser-treated track on the MgO-PSZ.\nThe structures described as `coral\u2019 and a few dendritic\nstructures were found in the centre of the track, while a\ncellular structure was observed at the midway point of\nthe track and a hexagonal structure appeared at the\nedge. According to constitutional supercooling theory,\nsuch a progressive change in the solidi\u00aecation character-\nistics within the same track, ranging from dendritic !\ncellular ! hexagonal structure, indicates the di\u0080 erent\ndegrees of constitutional supercooling extending from\nthe centre ! the midway point ! the edge of the CO2-\nlaser-treated track on the MgO-PSZ surface.\nIn the centre of the track, a few dendritic structures\nshown in Fig. 2b-2 appeared, indicating that the ratio\nG=R is small enough to form dendritic structures. Since\nthe cooling rate is very high in the centre, secondary\narms of the dendrites can be either completely absent\nor very short. Hence, a microcrystalline structure may\nbe formed and these spherical cells may coalesce to\nform the `coral\u2019 structure shown in Fig. 2b-1, in which\nthe perimetric cells of the coalescence grow in accord\nwith the dendritic pattern due to the relative slow\nscanning speed. On the other hand, the reason for the\n\u00aene-grain structures may be that cellular dentriditic\narms may have a slightly higher solute content than the\nouter portions of the arms. Hence, the melting point\nhere would be lower, and the thermal \u00afuctuations\nwould tend to cause melting just at this location. In\nany case, the roots of the dendrite arms are often smaller\nin diameter than the exterior portions and, even if melt-\ning in response to a thermal \u00afuctuation were uniform, it\nwould result in separation of the arm from the main\nstalk. When the arm that is separated is then carried\naway into slightly supercooled liquids, a new crystal is\nformed without a new nucleation event.\nIn the laser solidi\u00aecation process, convection \u00afow in\nthe melt pool provides an applicable mechanism, not\njust for breaking o\u0080 the arms of dendrites but also for\ndissipating superheat in the liquid so that the transported\narm can grow. However, strong turbulent convection has\nthe added e\u0080 ect of bringing heat pulses to the interface.\nThese heat pulses accelerate the melting o\u0080 of dendritic\narms [35]. Therefore, some \u00aene-grain cellular structures\nas shown in the left-hand part of Fig. 2c at the midway\npoint on the MgO-PSZ, which show the undulating\ncurrent, could come from the melted-o\u0080 arms since a\nstrong convection \u00afow exists in the melt pool. The\nother cellular structures, shown in the right hand part\nof Fig. 2c at the midway point on the surface of the\nMgO-PSZ, could be the cells induced from direct solidi-\n\u00aecation under supercooling.\nAt the edge, the G=R ratio at the interface is just\nslightly less than that required for stability; i.e. the\ndegree of constitutional supercooling is small. Conse-\nquently, the hexagonal structure shown in Fig. 2d can\nbe easily formed and becomes a stable interface shape.\n3.4 Microstructures induced by a relatively low power\ndensity\nA typical example of the microstructure obtained with\na relatively lower power density of 1.6kW\/cm2 and\ntraverse speed of 2000mm\/min is shown in Fig. 3.\nAgain, it is evident that di\u0080 erent solidi\u00aeed micro-\nstructures were observed in the di\u0080 erent regions, at\nthe centre (Fig. 3b), at the midway point (Figs 3c-1 and\nc-2) and at the edge (Fig. 3d) of the CO2-laser-treated\ntrack on the MgO-PSZ.\nAs can been seen from both Fig. 3b and Fig. 3d, the\nhexagonal microstructure appeared in the centre and\nedge of the laser-treated track, while the cellular struc-\nture is formed at the midway point shown in Figs 3c-1\nand c-2. Such solidi\u00aecation characteristics within the\ntrack indicate that the smallest gradient ratio is at the\nmidway point with the maximum power density of\nthe laser beam. At the centre and at the edge, the G=R\nratio is not high enough to produce a cellular structure\nand is just slightly less than that required for stability\nso that the hexagonal structure can be easily formed.\nThe hexagonal structure seems \u00afatter at the edge than\nat the centre, showing a more favourable gradient ratio\nfor the planar structure. This indicates that the extent\nof constitutional supercooling is higher in the centre\nthan at the edge, showing that the power density of\nlaser beam at the centre is higher than at the edge.\nON THE ROLE OF LASER-INDUCED MICROSTRUCTURES IN INFLUENCING THE SURFACE ENERGY 63\nB03503 # IMechE 2004 Proc. Instn Mech. Engrs Vol. 218 Part B: J. Engineering Manufacture\n3.5 The e\u0080 ect of beam shape and the resulting\ntemperature distribution\nThe CO2 laser used in the experiment is a TEM01 multi-\nmode. As can be seen from Fig. 4, the power density dis-\ntributions of the CO2 laser appear to be multi-mode.\nFrom Fig. 4a, it can see that the CO2 laser beam does\nnot display a maximum peak in the middle of the\nbeam; the peak is around the midpoint of the beam.\nMoreover, the small acrylic part at the centre has not\nbeen burnt out after CO2 laser treatment, indicating\nthat the maximum power density is not situated at the\ncentre but at the midpoint of the beam. The di\u0080 erent\nG=R ratios along the width of laser-treated track indicate\nthat the laser beam is not a Gaussian mode beam, but a\nTEM01 mode beam. Based on the convective currents\ncaused by a Gaussian beam pro\u00aele [36, 37] and tempera-\nture distribution of the TEM01 beam pro\u00aele, a schematic\ndiagram of the convection currents is shown in Fig. 4c.\nFrom the schematic temperature distribution of the\nFig. 3 Examinationof themicrostructureproduced in the laser track: (a) schematic depictionof the areaof the\nlaser track analysed; (b)\u00b1(d) surface optical images of the microstructures (b) at the centre, (c-1), (c-2)\nat the midway point and (d) at the edge of the laser track (with a power density of 1.6kW\/cm2 and a\ntraverse speed of 2000mm\/min)\n64 L HAO AND J LAWRENCE\nProc.

This is in accord with the result that the\ncellular structure formed at the midway point with the\nrelatively low power density which has the lowest G=R\nratio with the highest temperature in the laser beam.\nMoreover, the temperature at the centre is higher than\nat the edge of the laser beam, so that G=R at the centre\nis smaller than at the edge. This G=R ratio distribution\nresults in the formation of `coral\u2019 and dendritic structure\nat the centre and hexagonal structure at the edge of the\ntrack with the relatively high power density. It also\ncauses a less planar hexagonal structure in the centre\nthan at the edge of the track with the relatively low\npower density.\nIndeed, such \u00aendings have been reported by a number\nof workers conducting research into the laser treatment\nof various ceramics and alloys. Pei et al. [38] noted that\nboth equiaxed and dendritic microstructures were\nobtained in di\u0080 erent regions of the same laser-clad\nZrO2 layer, concluding that the di\u0080 erences were related\nto di\u0080 erent cooling rates in the various regions of the\nlaser-clad ZrO2 layer. Liu [35] obtained similar results\nin laser-sealed Y2O3\u00b1ZrO2 and MgO\u00b1ZrO2 ceramic\ncoatings. Shih et al. [39] observed that, across a\nYBa2Cu3Ox and laser-clad track, di\u0080 erent microstruc-\ntures were found in di\u0080 erent regions, and Shieh [40]\nmade similar observations across a SiO2\u00b1Al2O3 laser-\nclad track. Additionally, both noted not only that cellu-\nlar and dendritic microstructures were visible but also\nthat the microstructures were much \u00aener on the edge of\nthe clad track than at the centre. Such di\u0080 erences in\nmicrostructure type and size were ascribed to the various\ndegrees of constitutional supercooling, which, according\ntoMcCallum et al. [41], are inherent in laser processes. In\nthis study, di\u0080 erent microstructures within one CO2-\nlaser-treated track were observed and indicated the\ndi\u0080 erent stages of cell formation, due to the various\nFig. 4 Beam pro\u00aele of the TEM01 multi-mode CO2 laser burnt on acrylic (a) from a parallel aspect and (b)\nfrom a vertical aspect; (c) schematic diagram of the convection currents generated within the laser\nmelt pool\nON THE ROLE OF LASER-INDUCED MICROSTRUCTURES IN INFLUENCING THE SURFACE ENERGY 65\nB03503 # IMechE 2004 Proc.

When\nsuch a drop of liquid is brought into contact with a \u00afat\nsolid surface, the \u00aenal shape taken by the drop (and\nthus whether it will wet the surface or not) depends\nupon the relative magnitudes of the molecular forces\nthat exist within the liquid (cohesive) and between the\nliquid and the solid (adhesive) [42]. The contact angle\nis related to the solid\u00b1vapour surface energy \u00aesv, the\nliquid\u00b1vapour surface energy \u00aelv, and the solid\u00b1liquid\ninterfacial energy \u00aesl, through the principal of virtual\nwork expressed by the rearranged Young equation:\ncos \u00b3 \u02c6 \u00aesv \u00a4 \u00aesl\n\u00aelv\n\u20261\u2020\nClearly, to achieve wetting, \u00aesv should be large, while \u00aesl\nand \u00aelv should be small. Hence liquids of a lower surface\ntension will always spread over a solid surface of higher\nsurface tension in order to reduce the total free energy of\nthe system [43]. This is because the molecular adhesion\nbetween solid and liquid is greater than the cohesion\nbetween the molecules of the liquid [42].\nThe adhesion intensity of a liquid to a solid surface is\nknown as the work Wad of adhesion and is given by the\nYoung\u00b1Dupre equation:\nWad \u02c6 \u00aelv\u20261 \u2021 cos \u00b3\u2020 \u20262\u2020\nOptical micrographs of a sessile drop of glycerol placed\non the surface of a MgO-PSZ sample before and after\nlaser irradiation with the contact angle results are\nshown in Fig. 5. Additionally, as Table 2 shows, with\nall the control liquids used, the MgO-PSZ experienced\na signi\u00aecant reduction in contact angle as a result of\ninteraction with the CO2 laser beam.\nFig. 5 Contact angles for glycerol on (a) the untreated surface and (b) the CO2-laser-treated surface of the\nMgO-PSZ (with a power density of 1.6 kW\/cm2 and a traverse speed of 2000mm\/min)\nTable 2 Mean values of contact angles formed between the untreated and laser-treated MgO-PSZ for various\npower densities (traverse speed of 2000mm\/min) and the selected test liquids at 25 8C\nContact angle \u00b3 (deg)\nCO2 laser treated at the following power densities\nTest liquid Untreated 0.5 kW\/cm2 0.9 kW\/cm2 1.6 kW\/cm2 1.9 kW\/cm2 2.5 kW\/cm2\nGlycerol 79 76 62 40 50 54\nFormamide 73 71 57 36 44 50\nEthene glycol 61 60 48 29 38 41\nPolyglycol E-200 53 51 40 26 33 36\nPolyglycol 15-200 35 33 28 19 22 27\n66 L HAO AND J LAWRENCE\nProc. Instn Mech. Engrs Vol. 218 Part B: J. Engineering Manufacture B03503 # IMechE 2004\n4.2 The e\u0080 ect of surface oxygen content\nThe observed increase in the wetting performance of the\nMgO-PSZ will have certainly been in\u00afuenced by the\nincrease in the O content of the MgO-PSZ surface as a\nresult of the laser treatment, since this is known to\nincrease the likelihood of wetting [44\u00b147]. Wetting is\ngoverned by the \u00aerst atomic layers of the surface of a\nmaterial; thus, in order to determine accurately the\ncontent of the element O on the surface of the MgO-\nPSZ, it was necessary to examine the surface using X-\nray photoemission spectroscopy.\nIt can be seen from Fig. 6 that an increase in the\nsurface O content of the MgO-PSZ after interaction\nwith the CO2 laser beam was observed. The values\nobtained showed that the O content increased from an\ninitial value of 41.6\u00b164.3 at%, while the contact angle\nof glycerol decreased from an initial value of 79 to\n408. As can be seen, an overall increase of some\n22.7 at% in the amount of O on the CO2-laser-treated\nsurface of this MgO-PSZ sample has occurred. This is\nbelieved to be due to the oxidation of the MgO-PSZ\nsurface during melting and vitri\u00aecation. When the O\ncontent increases to a value of 64.3 at%, the contact\nangle decreased to its minimum value. This indicates\nthat O enrichment of the CO2-laser-treated MgO-PSZ\nsurface is active in promoting wetting and adhesion,\nas well as bonding. This \u00aending is similar to that of\nSong and Netravali [46, 47], who observed that the\nsurface O content increased after laser treatment and,\nin turn, e\u0080 ected a reduction in the contact angle. How-\never, when the O content is higher than 64.3 at%, the\ncontact angle increased despite the further increase in\nO content. This suggests that other mechanisms are\nactive and more dominant and so cause the contact\nangle to increase.\n4.3 The e\u0080 ect of surface roughness\nIt is important to consider also the in\u00afuence of the\nsubstrate surface roughness on the wetting contact\nangle. Roughness grooves on a surface, which may\ncontribute to the in\u00afuence of contact angles, can be\ncategorized as either radial or circular grooves. Any\nactual rough surface can be represented by a combina-\ntion of these two cases [48]. In fact, two roughness\nparameters can be de\u00aened: the Wenzel [48] type, DR,\nand the Cassie\u00b1Baxter [49] type, FR. In the instance\nwhere wetting spreads radially, then the resulting radial\ncontact angle \u00b3rad is related to the theoretical contact\nangle [50] \u00b3th by\ncos \u00b3rad \u02c6 DR\u20261 \u00a4 FR\u2020 cos \u00b3th \u00a4 FR \u20263\u2020\nAccording to Neumann [51], only if FR is equal to zero,\ncan a model similar to that for heterogeneous solid sur-\nfaces then be developed in order to account for surface\nirregularities and is given by the Wenzel equation\nr cos \u00b3ideal \u02c6 cos \u00b3rough \u20264\u2020\nwhere r is the roughness factor de\u00aened as the ratio of the\nreal to apparent surface areas, and \u00b3ideal and \u00b3rough are\ncontact angles for an ideal smooth surface and a rough\nsurface respectively. It is important to note that Wenzel\u2019s\ntreatment is only e\u0080 ective at the position of the wetting\ntriple line [48]. Equation (4) shows that, if r is large, i.e.\nthe solid surface is rough, then cos \u00b3rough is large and\n\u00b3rough decreases for \u00b3 < 908.\nBy varying the laser operating parameters it was\npossible to obtain a narrow range of surface roughness\nvalues. For experiment purposes only, the contact\nangles for glycerol in contact with the CO2-laser-treated\nMgO-PSZ surface were obtained at various points across\nthis narrow range of surface roughness values. As can be\nseen from Fig. 7, the surface of the untreated MgO-PSZ\nsamples was very smooth, with an average Ra value of\naround 0.295mm. After CO2 laser treatment it can be\nseen that the roughness of the MgO-PSZ surface\nincreased. The results given in Fig. 7 reveal that CO2\nlaser treatment consistently brought about a rougher\nsurface; \u00b3was lower than that for the smoother untreated\nsurface. This observation is according to equation (4)\nand the \u00aendings of other workers [52\u00b155]; an increase\nin surface roughness ought to e\u0080 ect a decrease in \u00b3,\nwhen it is lower than 908. Moreover, it must be noted\nthat the experimental conditions in this study and in\nthe previous work by others are very di\u0080 erent. Whereas\nin the previous work only the surface roughness was\naltered, in this work the CO2 laser treatment e\u0080 ects\nchanges in many other surface properties besides rough-\nness. From Fig. 7, it is observed that, from an initial\nmaximum \u00b3 of 798 in the untreated state and a surface\nroughness of 0.295mm, CO2 laser treatment results in a\nminimum \u00b3 of 408 at a surface roughness of 0.717mm.\nFig. 6 Relationship between the glycerol contact angle and\nsurface O content for the untreated and laser-treated\nMgO-PSZ with various power densities\nON THE ROLE OF LASER-INDUCED MICROSTRUCTURES IN INFLUENCING THE SURFACE ENERGY 67\nB03503 # IMechE 2004 Proc. Instn Mech. Engrs Vol. 218 Part B: J. Engineering Manufacture\nHowever, it is also worth remarking that the increase in\nsurface roughness of the MgO-PSZ obtained after laser\ntreatment is very small, only about 0.4 mm, and is not\nproportional to the considerable reduction in the contact\nangle. Consequently, it is postulated that other factors\nsuch as changes in the surface energy and O content\nplay a more predominant role than surface roughness\nin the signi\u00aecant decrease in contact angle for the\nMgO-PSZ after CO2 laser treatment. This is enforced\nby the fact that, after the point with the minimum \u00b3,\nthere is a relatively small increase from 40 to 548 in \u00b3,\ndespite the marked increase from 0.717 to 3.854mm in\nsurface roughness.\n4.4 E\u0080 ects of solidi\u00aeed microstructures and surface\nmelting on contact angle\nIn order to analyse the e\u0080 ects that the solidi\u00aeed structure\nof the MgO-PSZ surface has on the wettability perfor-\nmance of the MgO-PSZ, a series of wetting experiments\nFig. 7 Relationship between the glycerol contact angle and surface roughness for the untreated and laser-\ntreated MgO-PSZ with various power densities\nFig. 8 Relationship between the contact angle on the untreated and CO2-laser-treatedMgO-PSZ and power\ndensity and solidi\u00aeed structure\n68 L HAO AND J LAWRENCE\nProc. Instn Mech. Engrs Vol. 218 Part B: J. Engineering Manufacture B03503 # IMechE 2004\nusing only glycerol were conducted to determine the\ncontact angle for a range of laser power densities. In\nthis way, it was possible to obtain di\u0080 erent solidi\u00aeed\nmicrostructure on the surface of the MgO-PSZ. In\norder to simplify the analysis, the structure was de\u00aened\naccording to the main structure on the MgO-PSZ surface\nafter CO2 laser treatment, as shown in Fig. 8. It can be\nseen from Fig. 8 that the microstructure on the surface\nof the CO2-laser-treated MgO-PSZ is shown to have a\nsigni\u00aecant e\u0080 ect on the contact angle. The mere reorder-\ning of crystals that occurs at power densities below\naround 0.5 kW\/cm2 appears to have only a slight e\u0080 ect\non the contact angle, reducing it from 79 to 768. At\naround 0.9 kW\/cm2, the contact angle decreases signi\u00ae-\ncantly from 77 to 628, with the hexagonal structure on\nthe MgO-PSZ surface. With a further increase in power\ndensity to around 1.6 kW\/cm2, the contact angle\ndecreases sharply from 62 to 408, with some crystalline\ncell structures beginning to form in the treated track.\nOne reason for this sharp reduction in the contact\nangle at this point may be that melting is initiated with\nthis power density, signifying that this is an essential pre-\nrequisite in order for signi\u00aecant reductions in the contact\nangle to be realized. After this point an increase in the\ncontact angle from 40 to 508 occurs corresponding to\nthe point of uniform cell structure formation; then\nfrom 50 to 548, dendrites and coral structure occurred.\nIndeed, work conducted by Zhang et al. [56] found that\nsigni\u00aecant improvements in the bond strength of a\nSi3N4 ceramic could be realized only when excimer\nlaser treatment of a structural alloy steel (SAE 4340)\nresulted in surface melting. Similarly, Lawrence and Li\n[57] observed a sharp reduction in the contact angle at\nthe point of melting onset of amalgamated oxide com-\npound grout (AOCG) after HPDL treatment and a\nsmall but discernible increase in the contact angle with\nthe generation of a rougher surface at higher power\nlevels.\nIn general, the laser radiation induces the micro-\nstructural change and consequently causes a reduction\nin the contact angle on the MgO-PSZ surface. The\ncontact angle begins to decrease signi\u00aecantly when the\ncellular structure forms on the surface. The onset of\nmelting and cell formation creates a sharp decrease in\nthe contact angle.\n4.5 Surface energy of the MgO-PSZ and dispersive or\npolar character\n4.5.1 Surface energy of the MgO-PSZ\nThe intermolecular attraction which is responsible for\nsurface energy \u00ae results from a variety of intermolecular\nforces whose contribution to the total surface energy is\nadditive [58]. The majority of these forces are functions\nof the particular chemical nature of a certain material,\nand as such the total surface energy consists of \u00aep\n(polar or non-dispersive interaction) and \u00aed (dispersive\ncomponent, since van der Waals forces are present in\nall systems regardless of their chemical nature). There-\nfore, the surface energy of any system can be described\nby [59]\n\u00ae \u02c6 \u00aed \u2021 \u00aep \u20265\u2020\nSimilarly,Wad can be expressed as the sum of the di\u0080 er-\nent intermolecular forces that act at the interface [60]:\nWad \u02c6Wdad \u2021Wpad \u02c6 2\u2026\u00aedsv\u00aedlv\u20201=2 \u2021 2\u2026\u00aepsv\u00aeplv\u20201=2 \u20266\u2020\nHowever, by equating equation (6) to equation (2), the\ncontact angle for solid\u00b1liquid systems where both disper-\nsion forces and polar forces are present can be related to\nthe surface energies of the respective liquid and solid by\ncos \u00b3 \u02c6 2\u2026\u00ae\nd\nsv\u00ae\nd\nlv\u20201=2 \u2021 2\u2026\u00aepsv\u00aeplv\u20201=2\n\u00aelv\n\u00a4 1 \u20267\u2020\nBy plotting the graph of cos \u00b3 against (\u00aedlv)\n1=2=\u00aelv accord-\ning to equation (7), it is possible to estimate adequately\nthe dispersive component of the MgO-PSZ surface\nenergy, \u00aedsv. Thus, according to Fowkes [59], the value\nof \u00aedsv is estimated from the gradient [equal to 2(\u00ae\nd\nsv)\n1=2]\nof the line which connects the origin (cos \u00b3 \u02c6 \u00a4 1) with\nthe intercept point of the straight line [cos \u00b3 against\n(\u00aedlv)\n1=2=\u00aelv] correlating the data point with the abscissa\nat cos \u00b3 \u02c6 1. Figure 9 shows the best-\u00aet plot of cos \u00b3\nagainst (\u00aedlv)\n1=2=\u00aelv according to equation (7) for the\nuntreated and laser-treated MgO-PSZ\u00b1experimental\ncontrol liquid system. From Fig. 9 the values of \u00aedsv for\nthe untreated and the CO2-laser-treated MgO-PSZ\nwere calculated as 42.7 and 48.2mJ\/m2 respectively.\nComparing the ordinate intercept points of the untreated\nand laser-treated MgO-PSZ\u00b1liquid systems, it can be\nseen clearly from Fig. 9 that, for the untreated MgO-\nPSZ\u00b1liquid systems, the best-\u00aet straight line intercepts\nthe ordinate closer to the origin. This indicates that, in\nprinciple, dispersion forces act mainly at the MgO-\nPSZ\u00b1liquid interfaces, resulting in poor adhesion\n[59, 61]. In contrast, Fig. 9 shows that the best-\u00aet straight\nline for the laser-treated MgO-PSZ\u00b1liquid systems inter-\ncepts the ordinate considerably higher above the origin.\nThis is indicative of the action of polar forces across\nthe interface, in addition to dispersion forces; hence\nimproved wettability and adhesion is promoted [51, 53].\nAdditionally, since neither of the best-\u00aet straight lines\nintercepts below the origin, then it can be assumed that\nno equilibrium \u00aelm pressure of adsorbed vapour on the\nMgO-PSZ surface (untreated and laser treated) occurred\n[59, 61].\nThe value of the polar component of the MgO-PSZ\nsurface energy \u00aepsv cannot be determined directly from\nFig. 9. This is because the intercept of the straight line\n[cos \u00b3 against (\u00aedlv)\n1=2=\u00aelv] is at 2\u2026\u00aepsv\u00aeplv\u20201=2=\u00aelv and thus\nonly refers to individual control liquids and not to the\nON THE ROLE OF LASER-INDUCED MICROSTRUCTURES IN INFLUENCING THE SURFACE ENERGY 69\nB03503 # IMechE 2004 Proc.

However, it has been\nestablished that the entire amount of the surface energies\ndue to dispersion forces either of the solids or of the\nliquids are active in the wettability performance [59, 62].\nAs such, it is possible to calculate the dispersive com-\nponent of the work of adhesion, Wdad, by using only the\nrelevant part of equation (6); thus\nWdad \u02c6 2\u2026\u00aedsv\u00aedlv\u20201=2 \u20268\u2020\nTable 3 shows the values of Wad calculated using equa-\ntion (2) and the values of Wdad calculated using equation\n(8) for both the untreated and the CO2-laser-treated\nMgO-PSZ.

Table 4 gives the values determined for \u00aedsv\nand \u00aepsv for both the untreated and the CO2-laser-treated\nMgO-PSZ.\nAs can be seen from Table 4, CO2 laser treatment of the\nsurface of the MgO-PSZ leads to an overall increase in the\ntotal surface energy \u00aesv, from 52.8 to 108.9mJ\/m\n2 while,\nmore importantly, also signi\u00aecantly increasing the polar\ncomponent of the surface energy \u00aepsv, from 10.1 to\n60.7mJ\/m2. These increases (in particular the increase in\n\u00aepsv) have a positive e\u0080 ect upon the action of wetting and\nadhesion [51], since primarily both dispersion and polar\nforces are active to a greater extent [59, 61]. The changes\nin the surface energy of the MgO-PSZ after laser treat-\nment are thought to be due to the fact that CO2 laser\ntreatment of the surface of the MgO-PSZ results in\npartial vitri\u00aecation of the surface, a transition that is\nknown to e\u0080 ect an increase in \u00aepsv [62], and thus an\nimprovement in the wettability characteristics and an\nincrease in the adhesion at the interface in contact with\nthe control liquids. This conclusion is in strong agreement\nwith the \u00aendings of Agathopoulos and Nikolopoulos [63],\nwho from a wettability analysis of SiO2\u00b1TiO2 in various\nstates, from fully crystalline through to completely vitri-\n\u00aeed, found that, as the crystallites in the material\ndecreased, \u00aepsv increased.\n4.5.2 Surface energy and laser parameters\nIn order to \u00aend the relationship between the micro-\nstructure and surface energy of the MgO-PSZ, samples\ntreated under di\u0080 erent power densities were analysed.\nSimilarly, it is possible to estimate reasonably accurately\n\u00aedsv of the MgO-PSZ before and after CO2 laser treatment\nat various power densities.

A comparison of the ordinate\nintercept points of the untreated and CO2-laser-treated\nMgO-PSZ material\u00b1liquid systems, shown in Fig. 9,\nreveals that, for the material\u00b1liquid systems of the\nuntreated and CO2-laser-treated MgO-PSZ with\n0.5 kW\/cm2 power density, the best-\u00aet straight line\nintercepts the ordinate relatively close to the origin. On\nthe other hand, Fig. 9 shows that the best-\u00aet straight\nline for the MgO-PSZ material\u00b1liquid systems of the\nsamples treated by a higher laser power density intercept\nthe ordinate considerably higher above the origin. The\nhighest intercept point is for the sample treated with a\npower density of 1.6 kW\/cm2 and a traverse speed of\n2000mm\/min. This is signi\u00aecant since an interception\nof the ordinate well above the origin is indicative of the\naction of polar forces across the interface, in addition\nto dispersion forces; hence improved wettability and\nadhesion is promoted [59, 61]. Therefore, it suggests\nthat the action of polar forces and wettability of the\nCO2-laser-treated MgO-PSZ can be modi\u00aeed according\nto the power densities. According to the values of \u00aedsv,\nit is possible to calculate \u00aepsv directly for the untreated\nand CO2-laser-treated MgO-PSZ material using equa-\ntion (12) with the appropriate values of the constant a\ngiven in Table 3. Table 4 gives the values determined\nfor \u00aedsv and \u00ae\np\nsv, as well as the total surface energy for\nboth the untreated and the CO2-laser-treated MgO-PSZ.\nAs can be seen from Fig. 10, after CO2 laser treatment,\n\u00aesv and \u00ae\np\nsv increased depending on the microstructures\nobtained at di\u0080 erent laser parameters. However, \u00aedsv\nexperiences only a very slight increase. For the sample\ntreated with a relatively low power density, only mere\ncrystal reordering appeared on the surface of the MgO-\nPSZ, with little change in the surface energy being seen.\nWhen a hexagonal microstructure was generated on the\nsurface of the MgO-PSZ, obvious increases in \u00aesv and\n\u00aepsv are observed (see Fig. 10). For the sample treated\nwith a relatively medium power density, the cell forma-\ntion on the MgO-PSZ surface corresponded to the\nmaximum \u00aesv and \u00ae\np\nsv. With increases in the power\ndensity and traverse speed, the uniform cell micro-\nstructure on the surface of the MgO-PSZ causes \u00aesv\nand \u00aepsv to decrease from the maximum value. When\ncoral and dendritic microstructures appear on the sur-\nface of the MgO-PSZ, \u00aesv and \u00ae\np\nsv are further reduced\nfrom their maxima. A similar trend of modi\u00aecation\naccording to the laser parameter for the MgO-PSZ is\nalso observed for the adhesion Wad of glycerol shown\nin Fig. 11.\n4.6 Identi\u00aecation of the main factors active during\nmodi\u00aecation of wettability characteristics\nIn order to elucidate and give a greater understanding of\nthe basic process phenomena and the numerous factors\ninvolved, this section discusses the predominant in\u00afuential\nTable 4 Determined surface energy values for the MgO-PSZ before and after laser treatment of various power densities (traverse\nspeed of 2000mm\/min)\nCO2 laser treated at the following laser densities\nLaser parameter Untreated 0.5 kW\/cm2 0.9kW\/cm2 1.6 kW\/cm2 1.9 kW\/cm2 2.5 kW\/cm2\nDispersive component \u00aedsv (mJ\/m\n2) 42.7 43.8 44.4 48.2 47.5 48.2\nPolar component \u00aepsv (mJ\/m\n2) 10.1 10.4 21.9 60.7 33.2 27.7\nTotal \u00aesv (mJ\/m\n2) 43.3 44.2 56.3 108.9 80.7 74.9\nON THE ROLE OF LASER-INDUCED MICROSTRUCTURES IN INFLUENCING THE SURFACE ENERGY 71\nB03503 # IMechE 2004 Proc.

Instn Mech. Engrs Vol. 218 Part B: J. Engineering Manufacture B03503 # IMechE 2004\nfound to play a minor role in inducing changes in the\nwettability characteristics.\nIn order to investigate the in\u00afuential factors on the\nwettability characteristics of the MgO-PSZ surface, the\ncontact angles for glycerol were measured against\nthe surface roughness, the surface O content, the micro-\nstructure and the polar component of surface energy.\nIn order to analyse the in\u00afuential interrelationship\nbetween cos \u00b3 and surface roughness speci\u00aec to the\nCO2-laser-treated MgO-PSZ, the experimental results\nobtained are compared graphically as shown in Fig. 12.\nIt is observed that even a slight increase in roughness\nof surface below 0.717mm causes cos \u00b3 to increase in\naccordance with equation (4). After this point, cos \u00b3\ndecreases despite a sharp increase in surface roughness,\nindicating that other factors in\u00afuence the value of\ncos \u00b3. Therefore, the rougher surface of the modi\u00aeed\nsample has a higher value of cos \u00b3 than the smooth\nuntreated sample, but the change in cos \u00b3 is not propor-\ntional to the alteration in the surface roughness. It must\nbe noted that in this work the CO2 laser treatment e\u0080 ects\nchanges in many other surface properties besides\nroughness. It is believed that other mechanisms play a\nmore predominant role in in\u00afuencing the wettability\ncharacteristics of the CO2-laser-treated MgO-PSZ than\nthe surface roughness.\nConsequently, it is necessary to investigate the other\nfactors known to in\u00afuence wettability characteristics,\nnamely the O content and the polar component of the\nsurface energy. As can be seen from Fig. 12, cos \u00b3\nincreased with corresponding increase in the surface O\ncontent when the value of the surface O content is\nlower than 63.4 at%. This indicates that surface O\ncontent is certainly one of the factors in\u00afuencing the\nwettability characteristics of the MgO-PSZ. This is in\naccord with the established theory for the relationship\nbetween the O content of materials and their wettability\ncharacteristics [44\u00b147]. However, when the value of the\nsurface O content is higher than 63.4 at%, further\nincrease in the surface O content does not cause a\nFig. 12 Relationship between cos\u00b3 for glycerol and the surface roughness, the surface O content, the polar\ncomponent of surface energy and the microstructures of the untreated and CO2-laser-treated\nMgO-PSZ surface\nON THE ROLE OF LASER-INDUCED MICROSTRUCTURES IN INFLUENCING THE SURFACE ENERGY 73\nB03503 # IMechE 2004 Proc. Instn Mech. Engrs Vol. 218 Part B: J. Engineering Manufacture\nhigher value of cos \u00b3. This suggests that the O content is\nnot a major factor active in changing the wettability\ncharacteristics of the MgO-PSZ. A clear relationship\nbetween the value of cos \u00b3 and the polar component of\nsurface energy can be observed in Fig. 12, which reveals\nthat an increase in \u00aepsv will cause a rise in cos \u00b3. Moreover,\nsince a relationship was found between the surface\nmicrostructure and the surface energy of the MgO-PSZ\npreviously, it is assumed that the surface energy and\nthe surface microstructure are the chief in\u00afuential factors\non the wettability characteristics of the MgO-PSZ.\n5 CONCLUSIONS\nThe results presented in this work are a clear indication\nthat CO2 laser surface treatment brought about the\nmicrostructure change and the improvement in surface\nenergy of the MgO-PSZ. The extent of this wettability\ncharacteristics modi\u00aecation was generated by manipula-\ntion of the laser operating parameters. The in\u00afuential\nfactors active in e\u0080 ecting the changes in the value of\nthe wettability characteristics are identi\u00aeed as follows:\n1. Surface solidi\u00aecation and melting. The CO2 laser treat-\nment induced various solidi\u00aeed microstructures on\nthe MgO-PSZ surface, causing di\u0080 erent values of\ncontact angle for the test liquids. It was found that\na sharp reduction in contact angle was accompanied\nby the onset of melting and forming of crystal on\nthe surface of the MgO-PSZ.\n2. Increase in the polar component of the surface energy,\n\u00aepsv. This results from the melting and laser rapid\nsolidi\u00aecation of the MgO-PSZ surface. The action\nforce of \u00aepsv and wettability of the MgO-PSZ increased\nafter CO2 laser treatment.\n3. Surface O content. The increase in the surface O con-\ntent of theMgO-PSZ resulting from surface oxidation\nfollowed CO2 laser treatment was identi\u00aeed as further\npromoting the action of wetting, since an increase in\nsurface O content inherently e\u0080 ects a decrease in the\ncontact angle.\n4. Surface energy. It is believed that surface energy, by\nway of microstructural changes, is by far the most\npredominant element governing the wetting charac-\nteristics of the MgO-PSZ. The surface O content is\nalso seen to in\u00afuence a change in the wettability\ncharacteristics of the MgO-PSZ, while the surface\nroughness is found to play a minor role in inducing\nchanges in the wettability characteristics.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThe authors would like to express their gratitude to the\nSingapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology for\nallowing them to use their CO2 laser.\nREFERENCES\n1 Ohl, A. and Schroder, K.
