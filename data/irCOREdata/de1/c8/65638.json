However, it is only since the publication of Esping-\nAndersen\u2019s \u2018Worlds of Welfare\u2019 thesis in 1990 that the welfare state classification \nliterature has become particularly prominent (Pierson 1998). Based primarily on \nthe examination of labour market decommodification, Esping-Andersen proposed \na threefold welfare state typology whereby Western countries fell into one of \nthree regime ideal-types: Liberal, Conservative or Social Democratic. Esping-\nAndersen\u2019s work has provoked an extensive ongoing debate in the literature, \nabout which principles should be used to classify welfare states (Alber 1995; \nKorpi and Palme 1998; Castles 1998; Abrahamson 1999; Kautto 2002; Bambra \n2005a, 2005b); in which regimes particular countries belong (Ginsburg 1992; \nLeibfried 1992; Castles and Mitchell 1993; Ferrera 1996); the number of different \nregime types (Leibfried 1992; Castles and Mitchell 1993; Ferrera 1996; Bonoli \n1997; Pitzurello[qu2] 1999; Bambra 2005b); the methodology of regime \nconstruction (Kangas 1994; Ragin 1994; Pitruzzello 1999; Bambra 2006); and \nthe nature of gender stratification within different types of welfare state (Lewis \n1992; Orloff 1993; Sainsbury 1994[qu3], 1999; Bambra 2004).  \nAs a result of these criticisms a number of rival welfare state typologies \nhave emerged, each based on different classification criteria, and each trying to \ncapture in its own way what a welfare state actually does. Some have extended \nthe remit of the welfare state modelling literature to include aspects of gender \nstratification and defamilization (Lewis 1992; Siaroff 1994; Lewis and Ostner \n1995; Esping-Andersen 1999; Sainsbury 1999; Korpi 2000; Bambra 2004; \nPascall and Lewis 2004), while others have examined the role of welfare state \nservices (Bambra 2005a, 2005b). In addition, the methodological critique of \nEsping-Andersen\u2019s work (for an overview, see Bambra 2006) has led to the \nproduction of numerous welfare state taxonomies, many of them based on the \nreworking of Esping-Andersen\u2019s data, yet still suggesting alternative regimes and \ncountry classifications (Kangas 1994; Ragin 1994; Shalev 1996; Obinger and \nWagschal 1998; Pitzurello 1999; Wildeboer Schut et al. 2001). This means that \nwithin the contemporary comparative social policy literature, even among those \ntypologies and taxonomies that only examine income protection or the labour \nmarket aspects of welfare state provision, there are a number of contrasting \nclaims for the existence of three (Esping-Andersen 1990, 1999; Ragin 1994; \nShalev 1996; Wildeboer Schut et al. 2001), four (Leibfried 1992; Castles and \nMitchell 1993, Kangas 1994; Ferrera 1996; Bonoli 1997; Korpi and Palme 1998), \nand even as many as five different types of welfare state regimes (Obinger and \nWagschal 1998; Pitzurello 1999).  \n 3 \nThe result is that the welfare state modelling literature is in a state of \nconfusion and inertia as it is unclear which of these competing systems of \nclassification is currently the most accurate or useful and which are less so. It is \nthe purpose of this article to establish some clarity in this regard by comparing \nthe classifications and determining which are currently of the most utility: it will \nthereby \u2018sift the wheat from the chaff\u2019 in terms of welfare state regime theory.  \n \n<ha>Typologies and Taxonomies<\/ha> \n \nEsping-Andersen\u2019s original (1990) analysis of decommodification levels in \neighteen countries produced an initial threefold typology of welfare states: Liberal \n(Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, UK, USA), Conservative (Finland, \nFrance, Germany, Italy, Japan, Switzerland), and Social Democratic (Austria, \nBelgium, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden).1 In using decommodification, that \nis \u2018the extent to which individuals and families can maintain a normal and socially \nacceptable standard of living regardless of their market performance\u2019 (Esping-\nAndersen 1987: 86), his approach was an attempt to examine what a welfare \nstate does, rather than how much money it is afforded (Esping-Andersen 1990: \n2). Conversely, though, many of the criticisms directed at his typology were \nmade on the basis that it had not in fact adequately measured what welfare \nstates do, nor indeed managed to correctly classify many countries. This led to \nthe construction of alternative typologies, and taxonomies, each based on slightly \ndifferent measures of welfare state labour market protection and each producing \nslightly different results (see tables 1 and 2). Typologies are theoretically \ninformed categorizations of welfare states while taxonomies are purely \nempirical.[T1][T2] \nOn the basis of the cross-classification of the same eighteen nations in \nterms of aggregate expenditure levels and degrees of benefit equality, Castles \nand Mitchell (1993) argued for the existence of a \u2018Radical\u2019 (Liberal subgroup) \nfourth regime (UK, Australia and New Zealand). Institutional analysis (Korpi and \nPalme 1998), cluster analysis (Kangas 1994), BOOLEAN comparative analysis \n(Ragin 1994), factor analysis (Shalev 1996), and principal component analysis \n(Wildeboer Schut et al. 2001) also supported the existence of a fourth regime \ntype (see table 2). Cluster analysis by Obinger and Wagschal (1998) and \nPitzurello (1999) suggested another subgroup, this time within the Conservative \nregime, and thereby laid claim to a possible fivefold welfare state regime typology \n(table 2). However, by extending the variety of countries used, Leibfried (1992), \nFerrera (1996) and Bonoli (1997) identified another distinctive \u2018Latin\u2019, or \n 4 \n\u2018rudimentary\u2019, fourth regime type (Spain, Portugal, Greece and, to a lesser \nextent, Italy and France \u2013 table 1). \nTables 1 and 2 show the different results of each of the welfare state \nclassifications, both in terms of the regimes asserted by each typology and the \nconstituent countries within them. A number of countries are positioned in the \nsame regime type in almost all of the classifications. For example, Canada and \nthe USA are positioned in the least generous (Liberal) regime type in all of the \ntypologies and taxonomies; similarly, Denmark, Norway and Sweden always \nappear together in the most generous regime type (Social Democratic) regardless \nof which indicators are used to construct the typology. Furthermore, Greece, \nPortugal and Spain are considered to be the core countries of the Latin regime, \nand Germany is the one exemplar of the Conservative ideal-type model. The \npositioning of the other countries, however, is a more disputed matter. For \nexample, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand and the UK are positioned in either the \nLiberal or the Radical regime type; Austria, Belgium, Finland and the Netherlands \nare placed in either the Conservative or the Social Democratic regime type; and \nItaly and France are placed in either the Conservative or the Latin regime type \n(see tables 1 and 2). Most contentious is the case of Switzerland, which is placed \nin three different regime types: Liberal (Castles and Mitchell 1993; Ragin 1994; \nShalev 1996; Korpi and Palme 1998; Obinger and Wagschal 1998), Conservative \n(Esping-Andersen 1990; Ferrera 1996; Pitzurello 1999), and Latin (Bonoli 1997).  \nTable 1 also shows the variety of factors used to construct each of the \ndifferent welfare state typologies. All of these typologies are designed to capture \nthe income maintenance aspects of welfare state provision, yet they all do it \nusing different indicators: decommodification (Esping-Andersen 1990); basic \nincome (Leibfried 1992); aggregate expenditure (Castles and Mitchell 1993); \npoverty rates (Ferrera 1996; Korpi and Palme 1998); or social expenditure \n(Bonoli 1997; Korpi and Palme 1998). It could be, therefore, that each welfare \nstate typology is measuring a different aspect of welfare state provision and \nthereby drawing attention to different aspects of what welfare states do.2 \nHowever, many of the factors used to devise the diverse typologies are very \nsimilar, such as decommodification (Esping-Andersen 1990) and replacement \nrates and benefit coverage (Ferrera 1996), while others such as social \nexpenditure as a percentage of GDP are shared by different typologies (Bonoli \n1997; Korpi and Palme 1998). Perhaps, therefore, these diverse typologies and \ntaxonomies are ultimately measuring merely slightly different aspects of the \nsame underlying dimensions of the welfare state.  \n \n 5 \n<ha>The Two Dimensions of Welfare<\/ha> \n \nIndeed, Bonoli (1997) argues that the welfare state typology literature can be \ndivided into two halves: one of which examines \u2018how much\u2019 (i.e. the quantity of \nwelfare provision), while the other examines \u2018how\u2019 (the Bismarck\u2013Beveridge \nfunding dichotomy). Bonoli argues that welfare state typologies (such as those \noutlined in table 1) measure one of these two underlying aspects of the welfare \nstate more than the other: they are one-dimensional categorizations. For \nexample, he asserts that Esping-Andersen\u2019s (1990) typology measures the \u2018how \nmuch\u2019 issue whereas the typology of Ferrera (1996) encapsulates the \u2018how\u2019 \naspect more thoroughly. Therefore, regardless of the particular individual factors \nused by each typologist, there is in fact only one of two underlying dimensions \nbeing measured. This leads Bonoli to use just two factors (social expenditure as a \npercentage of GDP and the proportion of contribution financing and tax financing \nof social expenditure) to draw up a two-dimensional typology. He argues that, \ntaken together, these two factors represent both the \u2018how much\u2019 \u2013 the quantity \nissue \u2013 and the \u2018how\u2019 \u2013 the Beveridge tax-funded universalism versus the \nBismarck contribution-based social insurance system. As table 1 shows, his \ntypology is very similar to those drawn up using a more varied or numerous array \nof factors.  \nBonoli\u2019s work is very important in the context of this article as it suggests \nthat, rather than emphasizing the differences between how the various welfare \nstate typologies have been constructed and thereby resigning the literature to \none of indecision and incomparability, it is possible to use his two-dimensional \napproach to compare all of the different typologies and taxonomies on the same \nterms. It is therefore possible to determine which, if any, of the competing \ntheories of welfare state regimes are the most useful in terms of accounting for \nwelfare state variation in one-dimensional (how much or how) and\/or a two-\ndimensional manner (how much and how).  \nThis article therefore utilizes a two-dimensional approach to examine the \ncompeting typologies and taxonomies that exist within the contemporary \ncomparative welfare state literature. The aims are fourfold: firstly, to determine \nwhich of the income maintenance-based classifications are the most useful in \nterms of accounting for welfare state variance; secondly, which of the typologies \nmeasure one dimension more than the other and which dimension has dominance \noverall in welfare state modelling; thirdly, to explore which of the two underlying \ndimensions distinguishes most between different welfare state regimes; and \nfinally, to compare the results of the more theoretically derived typologies with \n 6 \nthe more empiricist taxonomies. Additionally, the value of Bonoli\u2019s two-\ndimensional approach will be given further implicit empirical exploration. Overall, \nthe analysis will \u2018sift the wheat from the chaff\u2019 and enable certain typologies and \ntaxonomies to be given more prominence within discussions about welfare \nregimes in the comparative social policy literature.  \n \n<ha>Methods<\/ha> \n \nComparative social policy in general, and the construction of welfare state \ntypologies in particular, has seldom been underpinned by robust methodology \n(Kangas 1994; Ragin 1994; Shalev 1996; Pitruzello 1999; Gough 2001; Bambra \n2006). This has meant that many welfare state typologies are theoretically rather \nthan empirically informed. For example, Esping-Andersen\u2019s Three Worlds typology \nhas been extensively criticized on the basis of its reliance on averaging and \nadditive indexes (Fawcett and Papadopoulos 1997; Arts and Gelissen 2002; \nBambra 2006). Some commentators, such as Kangas (1994) or Ragin (1994), \nhave responded to these problems by using methods such as cluster analysis or \nBOOLEAN comparative analysis (see table 2) to develop alternative, more \nempirically based, welfare state groupings. However, while these taxonomies are \nclearly a methodological enhancement, they merely serve to develop new, rival, \nwelfare state classifications. These methods are unable to test the relative merits \nof existing welfare state typologies and thereby serve merely to further fuel \ndiscussions about the relative placement of certain countries and the number of \ndifferent welfare state regimes (see tables 1 and 2). The use of statistical \ntechniques that enable the more extensive comparison and testing of the \ndifferent welfare state typologies (and indeed, taxonomies), such as analysis of \nvariance (ANOVA), multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), and discriminant \nanalysis (DA), has long been advocated within the welfare state modelling \nliterature (Pitruzello 1999).  \nMANOVA is an extension of ANOVA (analysis of variance) that enables the \ncomparison of the mean values of different groups (in this case welfare state \nregimes) for a variety of dependent variables (Weinfurt 1995; Tabachnick and \nFidell 2001). ANOVA calculates an F-statistic that is the ratio of the variance \nbetween the different groups (considered to be due to the independent variable \u2013 \ngroup membership) divided by the variability within each of the groups \n(considered to be due to chance). A large and significant F-statistic indicates that \nthere is more variability between the groups than within them and that therefore, \nthe group means are not equal (Pallant 2001). In other words, it shows that the \n 7 \ngroups differ significantly in terms of the dependent variable. Post-hoc tests, such \nas the Scheffe test, compare each group with all other groups to determine where \nthe differences lie. ANOVA thereby enables a comparison of whether the regimes \n(groups) in each of the different welfare state typologies and taxonomies actually \ndiffer from one another in terms of the chosen dependent variables. In addition, \nthrough the eta2 effect size statistic, ANOVA enables comparisons to be made \nbetween the rival classifications on the basis of how much of the variance in the \ndependent variable is accounted for by the grouping or independent variable. In \nother words, eta2 helps to determine which of the diverse welfare state \ntypologies\/taxonomies is the most useful because it accounts for the most \namount of variation.  \nMANOVA extends this analysis to include more than one dependent \nvariable (Field 2000). It compares the differences in the means of the group for \nthe dependent variables both individually, through separate ANOVAs, and \ntogether, by combining the dependent variables into one new linear composite \ndependent variable (Pallant 2001). Descriptive discriminant analysis (DA) extends \nthe MANOVA analysis as it explores the underlying dimensions of the data and \ndetermines which weighted combination of scores on the two variables best \ndistinguishes between the different groups (Field 2000; Silva and Stam \n2001[qu4]). The weightings of variables form a new composite variable: the \ndiscriminant function \u2013 a linear combination of the weightings and scores on this \nvariable (Cramer 2003). In this way, DA transforms the original set of variables \ninto one or more new functions. DA can also be used to predict group \nmembership (Silva and Stam 2001). Reflecting the MANOVA approach, a non-\nstepwise method of entry was used in the DA (Field 2000). \nThe choice of dependent variables is therefore very important in terms of \nthe analysis that ANOVA, MANOVA and DA can provide. Statistically, the \ndependent variables need to be conceptually related but not highly correlated \n(multicolinearity); be normally distributed (both univariate and multivariate); \nhave a linear relationship; and exhibit homogeneity of variance and covariance \n(Pallant 2001). More importantly, though, the chosen variables need to reflect as \nfar as possible the wide variety of factors and considerations used to originally \nestablish the different typologies which, as table 1 shows, range from \nstratification (Esping-Andersen 1990) to poverty rates (Ferrera 1996; Korpi and \nPalme 1998) and benefit equality (Castles and Mitchell 1993). This is by no \nmeans an easy task especially when, in addition to these variations, the \navailability of cross-national data is limited. Two dependent variables are used in \nthis article: social expenditure as a percentage of GDP; and employer and \n 8 \nemployee contributions as a percentage of total social security receipts. These \nvariables provide what Bonoli (1997) refers to as a two-dimensional approach to \nwelfare state classification (see the discussion above) as together they reflect \nboth the quantity of welfare state provision (social expenditure as a percentage of \nGDP) and how that provision is funded (employer and employee contributions as \na percentage of total social security receipts). \nAlthough much of the welfare state modelling literature has been about \ntrying to get beyond aggregate measures of funding and provision (see for \nexample Esping-Andersen 1990: 2, or indeed table 1), the social expenditure as a \npercentage of GDP variable is in fact highly correlated (see table 3) with a \nnumber of the other indicators that have been used to construct welfare state \ntypologies. For example, the correlation between social expenditure as a \npercentage of GDP and poverty rates is \u20130.783 (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, social \nexpenditure as a percentage of GDP is used as one of the main measures in a \nnumber of welfare state typologies, such as Castles and Mitchell (1993) or Korpi \nand Palme (1998), and employer and employee contributions as a percentage of \ntotal social security receipts is used by Bonoli (1997) and reflects Leibfried \n(1992). Therefore, although by no means exhaustive, these two robust variables \ndo offer a fairly indicative universal overview of the measures that have been \nused in welfare state classifications (Bonoli 1997).[T3]  \nThe data for the social expenditure as a percentage of GDP variable were \nobtained from the OECD (2004) and cover 21 countries: Australia, Austria, \nBelgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, \nJapan, Norway, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, \nSwitzerland, the UK, and the USA. These countries (see table 4) represent all of \nthose used by the various different welfare state typologies (with the exception of \nLuxembourg, which has not been included in the analysis as it is only considered \nby Ferrera 1996 and Bonoli 1997). The social expenditure as a percentage of GDP \nvariable is the mean calculated for the period 1997\u20132001 to minimize the \ninfluence of any year-on-year fluctuation. The data for the contributions as a \npercentage of total social security receipts variable were recalculated from the \nILO \u2018Cost of Social Security Database\u2019 (1996). Subsequently, the data for this \nvariable are older (ranging from 1990 to 1994) and generally only represent one \nyear\u2019s worth of data. This reflects the fact that, although more recent data are \navailable for this variable for the sixteen European countries (EU 2005), for the \nfive non-European countries the ILO (1996) was the only source. Therefore, to \nensure data comparability between the European and non-European countries \nthis data source was used for all the countries. It should be noted that these data \n 9 \nrelate to different time periods from those used in the original typologies and \ntaxonomies. All analysis was carried out using SPSS version 11.0.[T4] \n \n<ha>Results<\/ha> \n \nThe results of the one-way between groups ANOVAs are presented in tables 5, 6, \n7 and 8.3 Overall, they show that the differences between welfare state regimes \nwere statistically significant in the majority of the typologies and taxonomies \ntested. The significant ANOVAs all show large (>0.25) eta2 effect sizes (Weinfurt \n1995).[T5][T6]  \nThe results of the one-way ANOVAs for social expenditure as a percentage \nof GDP (tables 5 and 6) show that the Ferrera (1996) typology has the highest \neta2 score of 0.67. This indicates that 67 per cent of the variance in the \ndependent variable \u2013 social expenditure \u2013 is accounted for by the independent \nvariable \u2013 Ferrera\u2019s welfare state regimes. Similarly, the results in table 6 show \nthat the typologies of Esping-Andersen (1990), Leibfried (1992), Castles and \nMitchell (1993) and Bonoli (1997) all achieve statistically significant differences (p \n< 0.05) between welfare state regimes in terms of social expenditure and they all \noffer large effect sizes accounting for between 57 per cent (Esping-Andersen) and \n65 per cent (Leibfried, Castles and Mitchell) of variance. Indeed, only Korpi and \nPalme\u2019s (1998) typology does not achieve statistical significance (p = 0.20), \nindicating that there is no significant difference between their welfare state \nregimes in terms of mean social expenditure. \nThe results for the taxonomies (table 6) are similar as all bar one (Shalev \n1996) achieve statistical significance (p < 0.05) and the eta2 values, ranging from \n0.50 to 0.84, indicate strong effect sizes. The Wildeboer Schut et al. (2001) \ntaxonomy offers the largest eta2 value of 0.84, which suggests that their welfare \nstate regime classification accounts for 84 per cent of variance in social \nexpenditure as a percentage of GDP. Post-hoc comparisons using the Scheffe test \nindicated that the Liberal (Anglo-Saxon, British, etc.) regime type differed \nsignificantly (p < 0.05) from the Social Democratic (Nordic, Scandinavian, etc.) \nregime type consistently across all the typologies and taxonomies that achieved \noverall significance. This reflects the fact that in all the welfare state models the \nLiberal-style regime had the lowest value for social expenditure as a percentage \nof GDP (ranging from 16.15 to 20.83) while the Social Democratic-style regime \nhad the highest (26.63 to 28.03). The post-hoc tests also suggested that in a \nnumber of cases (Esping-Andersen, Ferrera, Ragin, Wildeboer Schut et al.) the \nLiberal-style regime differed significantly from the Conservative-style (Bismarck, \n 10 \nCorporatist, etc.) regime. None of the welfare state models indicated a significant \ndifference between the other regime types, with the exception of Kangas (1994), \nwhere a significant difference was also found between the Social Democratic \nregime type and the Radical regime.[T7][T8] \nThe results of the one-way ANOVAs for employer and employee \ncontributions as a percentage of total social security receipts (tables 7 and 8) \nshow a similar pattern for the typologies. Ferrera (1996) again has the highest \neffect size of 0.65. On this variable all the other typologies achieve statistical \nsignificance and large effect sizes (0.38 and above), including the Korpi and \nPalme model (p = 0.02; eta2 = 0.49). However, the results for the taxonomies \nare much less positive as only three (Kangas, Obinger and Wagschal, Pitzurello) \nof the six models show evidence of a statistically significant difference between \nwelfare state regimes on this variable. Obinger and Wagschal\u2019s model has the \nlargest effect size of 0.60, suggesting that welfare state regime membership \naccounts for 60 per cent of the variation in employer and employee contributions \nas a percentage of total social security receipts. The post-hoc Scheffe tests show \na great deal of variety in the models as to which regimes differ significantly from \none another, as while the taxonomy Scheffe tests (table 7) reveal significant \ndifferences between Conservative and Radical, there is no clear pattern of \ndifference in the typologies (table 7). The typologies show four significant post-\nhoc differences: Liberal and Conservative (Esping-Andersen, Ferrera); Liberal and \nLatin (Leibfried); Conservative and Radical (Castles and Mitchell); Conservative \nand Social Democratic (Bonoli, Ferrera). Generally, these patterns suggest that \nsignificant differences in contributions as a percentage of total receipts exist \nbetween the higher- and the lower-scoring regimes in each typology. In all the \ntypologies (table 7) and taxonomies (table 8), the Conservative regimes scored \nthe highest (ranging from 60.73 to 74.33) and the Liberal (26.26 to 50.71) and \nRadical the lowest (8.61 to 23.53).    \nThe MANOVA results, in which the two dependent variables are combined \n(table 9), reflect the patterns evident in the single dependent variable ANOVAs. \nMost importantly, Ferrera\u2019s typology with an eta2 of 0.66 accounts for the most \nvariance in the combined dependent variable, just as it did for both of the \ndependent variables in their separate ANOVAs. Similarly, the Korpi and Palme \ntypology once more failed to achieve statistical significance, suggesting that in \nthe combined MANOVA analysis, the means scores of their welfare state regimes \ndo not differ. There are also some interesting differences between the single \nANOVAs and the MANOVA results. For example, Esping-Andersen\u2019s typology \naccounted for 57 per cent of the variance in social expenditure as a percentage of \n 11 \nGDP (table 5) and 38 per cent of employer and employee contributions (table 7). \nHowever, in the MANOVA analysis of the combined variable Esping-Andersen\u2019s \ntypology only accounted for 37 per cent of the variance (table 9). Conversely, \nShalev\u2019s typology, which did not achieve a statistically significant ANOVA for \neither variable, accounted for 42 per cent of the variance in the combined \ndependent variable. These results reflect the fact that the MANOVA analysis takes \ninto account the correlation between the dependent variables. Also, the overall \nMANOVA results suggest that some typologies and taxonomies perhaps reflect \none variable \u2013 and therefore one dimension of welfare provision \u2013 more than the \nother, while others reflect both variables and therefore both dimensions of the \nwelfare state.[T9]  \nDiscriminant analysis (DA) offers the opportunity to examine these \nunderlying dimensions in more detail and determine which weightings of variables \n(functions) discriminate the most between the different groups in each typology \nand taxonomy. Table 10 shows the key statistics produced by the DA for each of \nthe welfare state typologies and taxonomies. Around half of the typologies and \ntaxonomies reflect two underlying dimensions (reflected by the number of \nstatistically significant discriminant functions) but the other half reflect only one, \nsuggesting that only one dimension distinguishes between the groups. Those \ntypologies and taxonomies that have variate correlations which are positive for \nboth of the variables (social expenditure as a percentage of GDP, employer and \nemployee contributions as a percentage of total social expenditure receipts), such \nas function 1 for Esping-Andersen, suggest that it is the combination of the two \nvariables that discriminates between the groups. Those typologies that have \nsignificant discriminant functions with one negative correlation and one positive \ncorrelation with the variables, such as function 2 for Leibfried, indicate that it is \nthe difference between the variables that separates the groups. For each \nsignificant discriminant function, the variable with the higher canonical correlation \ncoefficient contributes the most to group separation. The group variate centroids \n(mean function scores for each group) show which groups the discriminant \nfunction distinguishes between. So, for example, in the case of Esping-Andersen\u2019s \ntypology (see table 10) there is only one significant discriminant function \n(function 1 p = .002), it is the combination of the variables that distinguishes \nbetween the groups as both correlations are positive (r = .789; r = .509), social \nexpenditure contributes the most to group separation, r = .789 (although the \ncontribution of the other variable is still large, r = .509), and the group variate \ncentroids suggest that the discriminant function discriminates the Social \nDemocratic group 3 from the other two groups, particularly the Liberal group 1 \n 12 \n(as the difference between these two scores, 1.076 and \u20131.879, is the \nlargest).[T10]  \nThe DA shows that the welfare state classifications of Esping-Andersen, \nRagin, Shalev, Pitzurello and Wildeboer Schut et al. all reflect only one underlying \ndimension: in all cases except Shalev, it is the combination of the variables that \ndistinguishes between the groups; social expenditure contributes the most to \ngroup separation (although in the cases of Esping-Andersen and Pitzurello the \ncontributions correlation is also large). Also, the variate centroids suggest that \nthe function discriminates the most between the Liberal group 1 and the Social \nDemocratic group 3 (Esping-Andersen, Shalev, Ragin); the Liberal group 1 and \nthe Radical group 4 compared to the other groups (Pitzurello); and between the \nLiberal group 1 and the other groups (Wildeboer Schut et al.). The typologies of \nLeibfried, Castles and Mitchell, Ferrera, Bonoli, Kangas, and Obinger and \nWagschal encapsulate a two-dimensional approach as each has two significant \ndiscriminant functions. In each case, one of the discriminant functions shows \nsocial expenditure as contributing most to the discrimination between the groups \nand the other shows contributions as a percentage of total social security receipts \nas contributing most to group discrimination. The variate centroids suggest that \nthe social expenditure weighted discriminant function discriminates most between \nthe Liberal group 1 and the other groups (Leibfried, Bonoli, Kangas), while the \ndiscriminant function weighted more by contributions as a percentage of total \nsocial security receipts distinguishes most between the Social Democratic group 3 \nand the other groups (Leibfried, Ferrera, Bonoli, Kangas, Obinger and Wagschal). \nHowever, in the fourfold regime classification of Castles and Mitchell, the \ncontributions weighted variate centroids distinguish most between the Radical \ngroup 4 (\u20131.306) and the others, particularly the Conservative group 2 (.943). \nAgain, as expected from the MANOVA, the DA of the Korpi and Palme typology \nwas not significant.  \nTo summarize, the results of the single ANOVAs showed that out of the \ntypologies, Ferrera\u2019s accounted for the highest amount of variance for each of the \ntwo variables, and that differences between particular groups varied by typology. \nThe MANOVA confirmed Ferrera\u2019s position as the highest-scoring typology and \nKorpi and Palme as the lowest; and the DA suggested that some welfare state \nclassifications were two-dimensional, while those that were one-dimensional \nreflected the social expenditure as a percentage of GDP variable more than the \ncontributions as a percentage of total social security receipts variable. \nFurthermore, the DA provided clarity, unattained via the single ANOVAs, that \n 13 \nboth variables distinguished most between the Liberal groups and the other \ngroups, or the Social Democratic groups and the others. \nFinally, as the welfare state taxonomies were in part developed to be a \nmore methodologically robust and empirical way of classifying welfare states than \nthe typologies (Kangas 1994; Ragin 1994; Shalev 1996; Pitruzello 1999), it is \nworth considering whether the taxonomies account for more of the variance in \nthe two dependent variables and in the combined MANOVA variable than the \ntypologies. One-tailed Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare the average \neta2 values of the typologies and the taxonomies for each of the variables and the \ncombined MANOVA variable: no significant differences were found (social \nexpenditure p = 0.59; employer and employee contributions p = 0.07; combined \np = 0.59). This suggests that overall the taxonomies did not account for \nsignificantly more variance than the typologies. \n \n<ha>Discussion<\/ha> \n \nOne of the central aims of this article was to discover which of the various \ncompeting welfare state classifications, both typologies and taxonomies, were the \nmost currently useful and which the least. In one respect the results have \nenabled this aim to be fulfilled, as it is clear that some typologies account for \nmore welfare state variance than others. However, the amount of variance in the \ntwo variables \u2013 social expenditure and employee and employer contributions \u2013 \naccounted for by a number of the typologies and taxonomies is in fact very \nsimilar. Ferrera\u2019s (1996) typology achieved the highest eta2 values in both of the \nsingle ANOVAs (0.67 for social expenditure and 0.65 for employer and employee \ncontributions), and it also scored the highest eta2 value in the MANOVA. It would \ntherefore be simple to conclude that the Ferrera typology accounts for the most \nvariance and is therefore the most useful of the competing welfare state \nclassifications \u2013 the \u2018wheat\u2019, to follow through on the metaphor. However, the \nresults are in fact much less clear-cut than this as a number of the classifications \nachieved eta2 values very similar to Ferrera\u2019s (and not significantly different from \none another). For example, in the social expenditure single ANOVA, the \ntypologies of Leibfried (1992), Castles and Mitchell (1993), and Bonoli (1997) \nalso achieved eta2 values in the 0.60s, as did the taxonomies of Kangas (1994), \nRagin (1994) and Pitzurello (1999). Indeed, on this variable Ferrera was not \nactually the highest-scoring classification as the Wildeboer Schut et al. (2001) \ntaxonomy achieved an eta2 value of 0.82. Similarly, in the single ANOVA for \nemployer and employee contributions, Leibfried (1992), Bonoli (1997) and \n 14 \nObinger and Wagschal (1998) all obtained similar eta2 scores to Ferrera. On the \nwhole, the MANOVA results were likewise, with a number of typologies scoring \nsimilarly. This suggests that, far from having one single typology that stands out \nfrom the others, there are in fact a number of typologies that offer comparable \nlevels of variance explanation. This poses somewhat of a dilemma as it means \nthat, as a result of this endeavour, the welfare state modelling literature is \nactually little nearer to determining which individual classification model is the \nmost useful.  \nHowever, while the analysis has been unable to determine conclusively \nwhich classification system is the \u2018wheat\u2019, it has been more successful in \u2018sifting \nout the chaff\u2019: the classifications of Korpi and Palme (1998) and Shalev (1996) \nwere non-significant for the social expenditure single ANOVA, and the taxonomies \nof Ragin (1994), Shalev (1996), and Wildeboer Schut et al. (2001) were non-\nsignificant in the employee and employer contributions single ANOVA. The \nMANOVA replicated the non-significant results for Korpi and Palme (1998) but it \nalso produced another, less expected result: despite achieving high eta2 scores in \neach of the single ANOVAs, Esping-Andersen\u2019s \u2018Three Worlds\u2019 typology, by far the \nmost prominent of all welfare state classification systems, accounted for the \nlowest amount of variance (apart from the non-significant results) in the \nMANOVA. This suggests perhaps that his typology is less useful than others when \nconsidering a two-dimensional approach. Overall, the analysis suggests that the \ntypologies and taxonomies shown to score low eta2 values or non-significant \nANOVAs can perhaps therefore be given less accord within future discussions \nabout the number and consistency of welfare state regimes.  \nHowever, the typologies and taxonomies cannot be discounted or \nreinforced on the basis of the ANOVA, MANOVA and eta2 analyses alone. The \nresults of the DA must also be considered, particularly in terms of the extent to \nwhich the different welfare state classifications measure one or two dimensions of \nwelfare state provision. Those typologies and taxonomies shown by the DA to \nmeasure only one or other of the two underlying welfare state dimensions of \u2018how \nmuch\u2019 and \u2018how\u2019 (Bonoli 1997) should be given less prominence than those that \nare shown to reflect both aspects more adequately. The DA confirmed that in \nsome cases the typologies and taxonomies reflected only one dimension. For \nexample, in the classifications of Esping-Andersen (1990), Ragin (1994), Shalev \n(1996), Pizurello (1999) and Wildeboer Schut et al. (2001), social expenditure \nwas much more prominent, whereas in other cases, most notably Leibfried \n(1992), Castles and Mitchell (1993), Ferrera (1996) and Bonoli (1997), the DA \nshowed that typologies can encapsulate both aspects of welfare state provision. \n 15 \nThose that measure both aspects should surely be given more weighting in the \nwelfare state modelling literature than those that only examine one. \nThis is especially the case for those typologies, such as that of Esping-\nAndersen, for which claims are made that they \u2018get beyond aggregate measures \nof welfare state expenditure\u2019 by creating alternative means of comparison, such \nas decommodification. The DA results show that for the majority of typologies \nand taxonomies it is the social expenditure as a percentage of GDP weighted \nvariate that discriminates most between the regime types. When these results \nare taken together with the correlations between social expenditure as a \npercentage of GDP and other measures of welfare state provision, such as \ndecommodification, it suggests that a number of welfare state typologies still only \nreflect expenditure and little more. In common with criticisms made by those \nsuch as Castles and Mitchell (1993) or Bonoli (1997), it suggests that a lot of the \nattempts to \u2018get beyond\u2019 using expenditure as a means of comparing and \ncontrasting different welfare states have failed, and that perhaps this aspect of \nwelfare state modelling still needs to be fully achieved. The analysis in this article \nsuggests that the attempt to \u2018get beyond\u2019 aggregate expenditure comparisons \nshould remain as one of the focuses of comparative research.  \nThe two-dimensional analysis has also revealed which welfare state \nregimes differ most from one another in terms of either and both dimensions. The \nresults of the post-hoc tests in the single ANOVAs suggested that in the majority \nof the different typologies and taxonomies, the social expenditure variable (the \n\u2018how much\u2019 dimension) distinguished most between the Liberal-type and the \nSocial Democratic-type regimes, in other words between the highest and the \nlowest expenditure regimes in all of the typologies. Perhaps more interestingly, \nthough, in those classifications that included a Radical fourth regime type, the \nsingle ANOVA for employer and employee contributions revealed significant \ndifferences between the Conservative and Radical regime types. It was, as \nexpected from the literature, the Conservative regimes that scored the highest in \nterms of employer- and employee-based funding; however, it was the Radical \nrather than the Liberal regimes that scored the lowest. These results reinforce \none of the common tenets of the welfare state literature - the stark differences \nbetween the Liberal and Social Democratic regime types (however constituted) - \nbut it also lends further support to the arguments of those such as Castles and \nMitchell (1993) that a distinctive Radical regime exists, one which is more clearly \nBeveridgian than Bismarckian (Bonoli 1997) in orientation, even more so than the \nLiberal-style regime. To some extent, the DA reinforces these conclusions as the \ndiscriminant functions weighted more by social expenditure were shown to \n 16 \ndiscriminate most between the Liberal regime and the other regime types. \nHowever, while the post-hoc tests in the contributions single ANOVA suggested \ndifferences between the Conservative and the other welfare state regime types, \nin the DA, the weighted variate was better at separating the Social Democratic \nregime type from the others. This perhaps suggests that it is the lack of \ncontributions-based funding that is creating the divisions. The DA does, however, \ngo a little further than the single ANOVAs in terms of lending support to \nproponents of the Radical regime type as in some of the typologies and \ntaxonomies, such as Pitzurello (1999), the social expenditure weighted variate \nalso discriminated well between the Liberal and Radical regimes, and in the case \nof Castles and Mitchell (1993), the Radical group was distinguished from the \nothers most by the contributions weighted variate. \nThe two-dimensional approach proposed by Bonoli (1997) and used within \nthis analysis has therefore produced a means of comparing and contrasting the \ndifferent regime classifications that are currently circulating in the comparative \nwelfare state literature. Although not without its own limitations, which are \nacknowledged by Bonoli himself, the approach does offer a productive way \nforward in terms of enabling the construction of a welfare state typology which \nreflects both aspects of the welfare state modelling literature, at least as it \ncurrently stands in terms of the income maintenance dimension. It is perhaps \nsurprising, then, that the results in this article have not shown Bonoli\u2019s own \ntypology, based as it is on the two dimensions alone, to be of even more utility. \nThere are at least three reasons for this (but it needs to be reiterated that \nBonoli\u2019s typology accounts for a very high amount of variance in the MANOVA \nwith an eta2 of 0.62). On the one hand, Bonoli\u2019s analysis was much earlier than \nthe one in this article and the data he used were from a different date and \nsource. However, perhaps more influential was the fact that the method used by \nBonoli to put countries into regime types relied merely on cross-classification (see \nBonoli 1997), and therefore, unlike the MANOVA, it did not take into account any \ncorrelation between the two dimensions, and this may have led to incorrect \nclassification. Alternatively, of course, there could be a third underlying dimension \nof welfare state provision that Bonoli\u2019s two-dimensional approach overlooks, such \nas the mix of cash benefits and welfare state services (Castles 1998; Kautto \n2002; Bambra 2005a, 2005b). The two-dimensional approach could therefore be \nextended both methodologically, by using a more robust system of classification \nsuch as cluster analysis, and empirically, by including this third dimension \u2013 the \n\u2018how spent\u2019 aspect of welfare state provision. Perhaps then, the welfare state \nmodelling literature will finally succeed in obtaining a holistic typology. \n 17 \n  \n<ha>Limitations<\/ha> \n \nThe research in this article is subject to a number of limitations. Firstly, as \npointed out in the discussion section, it only examines two dimensions, which are \nthemselves based on two indicators \u2013 social expenditure as a percentage of GDP \nand employer and employee contributions as a percentage of total social security \nreceipts. If other indicators, or more indicators, had been used the results may \nhave been different. Therefore, although multivariate analysis was used, this \nmeans that it is likely that other, unaccounted-for factors are exerting influence \non welfare state variation. Subsequently, caution should be applied to the results \nand their interpretation, not least as the statistical correlations and associations \ndiscussed do not necessarily equate with explanation or causation. Furthermore, \nthe data used for the contributions variable were prone to possible year-on-year \nvariation and they were limited to the years 1990\u20134. Also, it needs to be noted \nthat the various typologies and taxonomies were based on data from differing \nyears (e.g. Esping-Andersen\u2019s data were from 1980) and so this article cannot \ncomment on the original fit of the classifications, it is only able to examine their \ncurrent relevance. The typologies and taxonomies may well have been more \naccurate at the time they were originally constructed (e.g. in the 1980s for \nEsping-Andersen), and they may still be currently accurate if all their constituent \nvariables are included (e.g. if decommodification indicators were reanalysed for \nthe 1990s for Esping-Andersen, or institutional characteristics were somehow \nincluded in the reassessment of the Korpi and Palme model).4 It is also important \nto acknowledge that welfare regime patterns change over time and that this \narticle has only examined the applicability of welfare state classifications at one \npoint in time. It is quite possible that different typologies and taxonomies will be \naccurate at different time points. Finally, most typologies were perhaps intending \nto measure something other than the two dimensions, and indeed some of them \nare based on a variety of factors, not all of which are quantifiable. The analysis in \nthis article is perhaps therefore limited by overly quantifying and thereby \nmarginalizing the more qualitative and theoretical aspects of typology \nconstruction. \n \n<ha>Conclusion<\/ha> \n \nAlthough the analysis has been unable to determine with any certainty which \nindividual classification is the most useful, it has provided evidence that one \n 18 \nsubgroup of the diverse regime classifications is more useful than the others. This \nis particularly the case when examining whether the classifications encapsulate \none dimension or two dimensions of the welfare state. It is proposed in this \narticle that those typologies that, in the DA, reflect the two underlying dimensions \nshould be given more prominence than those that only reflect one. Furthermore, \nthe eta2 results for the ANOVAs and the MANOVA should also be taken into \nconsideration, with those classifications obtaining higher eta2 values accounting \nfor more variation. This means that the four typologies of Leibfried (1992), \nCastles and Mitchell (1993), Ferrera (1996) and Bonoli (1997), and the two \ntaxonomies of Kangas (1994) and Obinger and Wagschal (1998) emerge as the \n\u2018wheat\u2019 while the others, particularly those that have non-significant differences \nbetween regime types, particularly Korpi and Palme (1998) and to a lesser extent \nShalev (1996), or which only reflect one dimension of the welfare state, such as \nRagin (1994), Shalev (1996), and Wildeboer Schut et al. (2001) and to a lesser \nextent Esping-Andersen (1990) and Pitzurello (1999), are the \u2018chaff\u2019. In addition, \nthe analysis has reinforced the fact that the differences between certain welfare \nstate regime types are more pronounced, particularly those between the Liberal \nand the Social Democratic types. However, it has also highlighted and upheld \narguments for the existence of a distinctive Radical regime type. \nMethodologically, this article has pioneered the use of ANOVA, MANOVA and DA in \nterms of the comparative welfare state literature and has demonstrated the value \nof these methods in taking the modelling debate forward. Future research should \nrely more on such sophisticated analytical approaches and expand empirically \nupon the two-dimensional approach of \u2018how much\u2019 and \u2018how\u2019 by adding the third \ndimension of \u2018how spent\u2019 in terms of the cash benefits and welfare state services \nmix (Bambra 2005a, 2005b). \n \n<ha>Notes <\/ha> \n \n1. <not>Esping-Andersen also reflects upon social stratification and the public\u2013\nprivate mix in welfare state provision. However, it is his decommodification \nindex typology that is widely cited (see, for example, Arts and Gelissen 2002). \n2. It should also be noted that the Korpi and Palme typology is also based on \nmore theoretical and qualitative data about the institutional characteristic of \nsocial insurance.  \n3. It is more usual to run the MANOVA first and then follow up with the single \nANOVAs. \n 19 \n4. An updated analysis of the full decommodification indicator set by Bambra \n(2006) suggests, however, that in the case of Esping-Andersen the threefold \ntypology is no longer accurate. Furthermore, research by Scruggs and Allan \n(2005) has questioned the original 1980 validity of the threefold \nclassification.<\/not> \n \n<ha>References<\/ha> \n \n<ref>Abrahamson, P.
