All rights reserved.Introduction\nAutosomal recessive neurodegeneration associated with genetic\ndefects in the PLA2G6 gene [1] may present with a number of phe-\nnotypes [2] including presentation in infancy [3,4] (infantile neuro-\naxonal dystrophy, INAD, MIM256600), childhood (atypical\nneuroaxonal dystrophy, neurodegeneration with brain iron accu-\nmulation, NBIA MIM610217, Karak syndrome MIM608395) [4,5]\nand also in adulthood [6,7] (early-onset dystonia-parkinsonism\nMIM612953). Mutation detection rate is particularly high (80\u2013ll rights reserved.\nCourt, Birmingham Women\u2019s\nB15 2TG, UK.\nan@bham.ac.uk (M.A. Kurian).90%) in children with classical clinical and radiological features\nof infantile PLAN [2,8].1\nClassical INAD (infantile onset PLAN) accounts for the majority\nof cases, and is characterised by infantile onset truncal hypotonia\nand progressive psychomotor regression [3,4]. Over time, children\ndevelop bulbar dysfunction, pyramidal tract signs, optic atrophy,\ncerebellar features and extrapyramidal features [3,4,9\u201312]. MRI\nfeatures can aid diagnosis [13\u201315]. The majority of patients have\nfeatures of cerebellar atrophy [4]. Cerebellar gliosis is seen in the\nmajority [4] but not all patients have this feature [16]. Some also\nhave evidence of brain iron accumulation [3,4]. Generalised sei-\nzures are often reported [17\u201319]. Dysmorphia is rarely described\n[20]. Death usually occurs around the \ufb01rst decade [3,4].1 Abbreviations used: PLAN, phospholipase associated neurodegeneration; MLPA,\nmultiplex ligation-dependent probe ampli\ufb01cation; ARMD, Alu recombination-med-\niated deletion.\n208 D. Crompton et al. \/Molecular Genetics and Metabolism 100 (2010) 207\u2013212Not all patients with typical clinical features of infantile PLAN\nhave mutations in the PLA2G6 gene [4]. Possible explanations for\nthis include genetic heterogeneity [1], PLA2G6 defects within intro-\nnic sequence or regulatory regions and CNVs that are undetected\nby standard diagnostic mutational screening strategies [21]. In re-\ncent years, MLPA has emerged as a high resolution technique to\ndetermine relative DNA sequence dosage [22,23].\nWe describe four children with infantile PLAN referred for diag-\nnostic PLA2G6 screening in which both disease-causing mutations\nwere not identi\ufb01ed on direct gene sequencing. Further investiga-\ntion with MLPA analysis detected a novel heterozygous duplication\nin patient 1 and a novel homozygous deletion in patients 2\u20134.Subjects and methods\nPatients\nThe patients described were referred to the West Midlands Re-\ngional Genetic Service for PLA2G6 analysis by their local paediatric\nneurologist\/geneticist. The medical case notes were analysed to\ndelineate the clinical features on history and examination. MRI\nbrain scans for patient 1 were reviewed independently by 2 paedi-\natric neuroradiologists (with consensus agreement on disparities).\nMolecular genetic investigation\nTechniques for DNA\/RNA extraction, PLA2G6 sequencing, MLPA\nanalysis and molecular characterisation of the CNVs are outlined in\nSupplementary data 1.Results\nClinical cases\nPatient 1\nPatient 1 was the \ufb01rst child of non-consanguineous healthy\nCaucasian parents. Early neurodevelopmental milestones were\nachieved. At 15 months, he developed gait instability and an alter-\nnating strabismus. Psychomotor regression ensued and by 19\u2013\n20 months of age, there was loss of ambulation. Between 2 and\n3 years he developed 4-limb spasticity. Speech regression was also\nevident. He developed severe bulbar dysfunction with excessive\ndrooling and feeding dif\ufb01culties requiring PEG feeding. Dystonia\nof all 4-limbs was also evident by age 5 years. He did not have\nany seizures.\nOn clinical examination (age 5 years) he was not dysmorphic or\nmicrocephalic, but had evidence of a right-sided manifest squint\nand bilateral horizontal nystagmus. There was excessive drooling\nand tongue fasciculation. On neurological assessment he was\nfound to have marked axial hypotonia. There was a postural kyph-\notic curvature of the spine. Limb examination revealed symmetri-\ncal 4-limb hypertonicity and hyperre\ufb02exia but no contractures.\nPlantar re\ufb02exes were upgoing bilaterally.\nMRI brain examination was undertaken at age 2 and 2.9 years\n(Fig. 1). Initial MRI scan showed evidence of a hypoplastic cere-\nbellum and vermis (Fig. 1A and B). There was no evidence of op-\ntic nerve hypoplasia or white matter abnormalities. On repeat\nMR neuroimaging at age 2.9 years, there was progressive cere-\nbellar atrophy (Fig. 1C and D). Although minimal basal ganglia\nabnormalities were noted on initial imaging (Fig. 1E), mild iron\naccumulation within the basal ganglia was evident on repeat\nimaging (Fig. 1F). Electromyographic (EMG) signs of chronic\ndenervation were evident in the upper limbs, lower limbs and\nbulbar musculature. Nerve conduction studies were normal. On\nEEG, widespread high amplitude fast activity at 16\u201322 Hz wasseen. Visual evoked potentials (VEP) and electroretinogram\n(ERG) was normal at age 2 years. Ophthalmological review de-\ntected bilateral temporal disc pallor. Histological examination\nof nerve tissue from a rectal biopsy (age 2 years) was normal.\nPatient 2\nPatient 2, a 4 year old girl was born to healthy consanguineous\n(2nd cousin) Irish parents. All early developmental milestones\nwere appropriately achieved. Symptom onset at 9\u201310 months of\nage commenced with psychomotor regression. She stopped vocal-\nising, developed complete loss of ambulation and could only sit for\nbrief periods with extensive support. There was no evidence of\nseizures.\nOn clinical examination, at age 21 months, she was not dysmor-\nphic or microcephalic. There was evidence of marked axial hypoto-\nnia and upper and lower limb spasticity (but no contractures or\nspinal deformity). She had evidence of nystagmus on clinical\nexamination. Ophthalmological examination did not detect any\nabnormalities.\nMRI brain (age 18 months) revealed cerebellar atrophy and a\nmarginally narrow pons but no evidence of basal ganglia abnormal-\nities. Electromyogram abnormalities were similar to patient 1. She\ndid not have any other electrophysiological investigations (VER,\nERG, EEG) or a sural\/skin biopsy as repeatednon-attendance at clinic\nappointments precluded further neurological investigation.\nPatients 3 and 4\nPatients 3 and 4, dizygotic male twins were born to healthy\nconsanguineous (1st cousin) parents, of Irish origin. There was no\nfamily history of neurological disorders and the family were not\nknown to be related to patient 2\u2019s kindred. The twins were born\nat 33 weeks gestation, but despite their prematurity, the postnatal\ncourse was uneventful. Early developmental milestones were\nappropriately achieved, but concerns were raised at 11 months of\nage as both children were yet to sit independently. At this stage\nboth children were noted to have strabismus. Psychomotor regres-\nsion ensued in both children with a gradual but progressive loss of\ncognitive and motor skills. A rapid decline in motor function was\nseen in patient 3 subsequent to a febrile viral illness at age\n22 months. Following this illness, he developed infantile spasms\nassociated with a hypsarrhythmic EEG pattern. At age 26 months,\npatient 4 also developed seizures (generalised tonic clonic epi-\nsodes) with an EEG pattern of high voltage slow background with\nsharp and slow wave discharges seen independently in each tem-\nporal region. Repeat EEG (5 months later) showed mild excess of\nmoderate voltage irregular slow activity with runs of high ampli-\ntude irregular delta activity with ill de\ufb01ned sharp components\nindependently over both temporal regions. Both children had oph-\nthalmological assessments showing optic atrophy. Over time, both\nchildren developed profound axial hypotonia, pyramidal tract fea-\ntures and bulbar dysfunction.\nMRI brain (at 24 months of age in both children) revealed mod-\nerate cerebellar atrophy, but no cerebellar gliosis or brain iron\naccumulation. Electrophysiological investigation revealed absent\nsensory nerve action potentials associated with a myopathic pat-\ntern on EMG. No clear binocular pattern of vision was evident on\nVEP. A sural\/skin biopsy was not undertaken in either patient.\nMolecular genetic investigation\nDirect sequencing of PLA2G6\nPatient 1: A heterozygous mutation (c.1674delG; p.Leu560Trpf\nsX5) was detected in exon 12 (Supplementary Fig. 1). A 2nd muta-\ntion was not detected.\nPatient 2\u20134: Molecular analysis did not detect any mutations in\nexons 1\u20134 and 7\u201317 of the PLA2G6 gene. Repeated failed attempts\nFig. 1.

Primers were designed for cDNA ampli\ufb01-\ncation of a putative tandem duplication from exon 7 to exon 4.\nSubsequent sequencing of patient 1 con\ufb01rmed that the exon 4,\n5, 6 and 7 duplication occurred within the PLA2G6 gene leading\nto a pathogenic truncating mutation (r.426-?_1077-?dup\np.Lys360LeufsX22).\nPatient 2\u20134: Fig. 2E\u2013G. PCR primers were designed to amplify\nthe region between intron 4 and intron 6. The PCR ampli\ufb01cation\nproducts were observed for patients but not in control samples.The genomic breakpoints were identi\ufb01ed (g.40638_47282del6632,\np.Leu204_Glu298del95) in intron 4 (between 38 537 112 and 38\n537 123 bp) and in intron 6 (between 38 530 480 and 38 530\n491 bp). The breakpoints could not be further delineated as there\nis a 12 bp region with 100% homology common to both intron 4\nand intron 6.Discussion\nTo date, \u000275 different genetic alterations of PLA2G6 have been\nreported in PLAN [1\u20134,6,8,12,17] including missense mutations\n(\u000268%), insertions (\u00020.75%), deletions (\u000214%), nonsense mutations\n(\u000214%) and splice site mutations (\u00020.75%). We report the use of\nMLPA in the detection of previously undetected novel large intra-\ngenic PLA2G6 rearrangements in four patients with classical infan-\ntile PLAN. Although this only a recently reported diagnostic use of\nMLPA in PLA2G6 analysis [21], this diagnostic tool has already been\nsuccessfully used in a number of other conditions [22,23] Indeed,\nMLPA analysis of the SCN1A gene in mutation-negative patients\nwith Dravet\u2019s syndrome detected a signi\ufb01cant chromosomal rear-\n   I:1       I:2\nDuplication Frameshift c.1674delG\n:1\nDuplication Frameshift c.1674delG\n1      2      3       4        5      6      7\nII:1  I:1   I:2   C1    C2   C3     N\nA\nB\nC\nD\nFig. 2.

Crompton et al. \/Molecular Genetics and Metabolism 100 (2010) 207\u2013212rangement rate of 12.5% [24,25]. From this study, we estimate that\nCNVs may also account for \u000212.5% PLA2G6 mutations identi\ufb01ed in\nthe UK Diagnostic Screening Service.\nMLPA analysis has important diagnostic implications. In patient\n1, the heterozygous duplication could not be detected by standard\ndirect gene sequencing. In patient 2, failed attempts to amplify\nexons 5 and 6 could have been due to a number of reasons (failed\nPCR ampli\ufb01cation or the presence of rare SNP variants in primer\nbinding regions). However MLPA alone cannot provide an insight\nas to the precise genomic location and\/or potential functional out-\ncomes of the deletion\/duplication [26]. Subsequent molecular\ncharacterisation has provided important information regarding\nthe nature of these CNVs. In case 1, analysis of cDNA revealed\nexpression of mutant mRNA species containing a tandem duplica-\ntion of exon 4, 5, 6, and 7, resulting in a frameshift and premature\nstop codon. In case 2, genomic delineation of the centromeric and\ntelomeric breakpoints revealed that both breakpoints were within\nan AluY repeat sequence (http:\/\/www.repeatmasker.org\/) in intron\n4 and intron 6 (showing 94% overall homology) (www.blast.nc-bi.nlm.nih.gov). An Alu recombination-mediated deletion (ARMD)\nas a result of misalignment of the Alu Y repeats is thus the most\nlikely mechanism for generating this deletion. Deletion of exons\n5 and 6 is predicted to lead to an inframe deletion which results\nin partial loss of the seven ankyrin repeats of the PLA2G6 protein.\nAnkyrin repeats mediate protein\u2013protein interactions and loss or\ndisruption of this motif would be predicted to have a deleterious\neffect on normal iPLA2-VI function.Conclusion\nIn conclusion, we describe the \ufb01rst reported use of MLPA in\nPLA2G6 analysis. Our data suggests that CNVs also have a role in\nthe pathogenesis of PLAN. As part of a PLA2G6 diagnostic screening\nservice, MLPA may contribute towards providing a de\ufb01nitive diag-\nnosis in an affected individual. It may also help remove the need\nfor unnecessary neurological investigation, improve the quality of\ngenetic counselling and aid accurate prenatal diagnoses.
