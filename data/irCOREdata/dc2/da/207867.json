To analyse the role of human rights in aid \nallocation of 21 donor countries. Methods. Econometric \nanalysis is applied to a panel covering the period 1985 to \n1997. Results. Respect for civil\/political rights plays a \nstatistically significant role for most donors at the aid \neligibility stage. Personal integrity rights, on the other \nhand, have a positive impact on aid eligibility for few donors \nonly. At the level stage, most donors fail to promote respect \nfor human rights in a consistent manner and often give more \naid to countries with a poor record on either civil\/political \nor personal integrity rights. No systematic difference is \napparent between the like-minded countries commonly regarded \nas committed to human rights (Canada, Denmark, the \nNetherlands, Norway and Sweden) and the other donors. \nConclusions. Contrary to their verbal commitment, donor \ncountries do not consistently reward respect for human rights \nin their foreign aid allocation. \n \nThe bilateral allocation of aid is one of the foreign policy \ntools available to donor countries. It will therefore be \ndetermined to some extent by the self-interest of the donor \ncountry as well as the recipient country\u2019s need for aid. Many \ndonors claim that respect for human rights also plays a role \nin their allocation decisions (see for example, Toma\u0161evski, \n1997; Gillies, 1999; Neumayer, 2003). This article tries to \n3 \nassess what impact, if any, respect for human rights really \nhas on the allocation of aid to recipient countries. \nThe article differs and improves upon the existing \nliterature on two major accounts: First, there has been too \nmuch exclusive focus on US aid allocation. Instead, this \narticle examines the allocation of aid from all 21 countries \nthat are members of the Development Assistance Committee of \nthe Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development \n(OECD). Second, I avoid the implicit bias of some of the \nliterature that has implicitly equated human rights with \npolitical\/civil rights, sometimes explicitly subsumed under \nthe heading of democratic governance. To do so, I introduce a \nfurther variable, namely personal integrity rights, which has \nbeen used before by a number of studies addressing US aid \nallocation (see, for example, Carleton and Stohl, 1987; Poe \nand Sirirangsi, 1994; Poe et al., 1994). Personal integrity \nrights are closer to the very core of human rights, referring \nto such things as imprisonment, disappearances, torture, \npolitical murder and other forms of politically motivated \nviolence. \nMost of the existing literature has focused on the role of \nhuman rights in US foreign aid allocation. The results from \nthese studies are somewhat inconclusive depending on which \nperiod is studied, whether economic or military aid is looked \nat and the methodology employed \u2013 see, for example, \nCingranelli and Pasquarello (1985), Carleton and Stohl (1987), \n4 \nPoe (1992), Poe and Sirirangsi (1994), Abrams and Lewis \n(1993), Poe et al. (1994), and Apodaca and Stohl (1999). \nAs concerns aggregate bilateral aid flows, Trumbull and Wall \n(1994) include a variable for political\/civil rights in panel \nestimations for 1984-89 finding a positive relationship \nbetween rights and the receipt of aid. This author has \nanalyzed the role of human rights in the allocation of \naggregate bilateral and multilateral aid in a panel from 1984 \nto 1995 (Neumayer, 2002). He distinguishes between \ncivil\/political and personal integrity rights (see section \nbelow), finding that as concerns bilateral aid flows countries \nwith higher respect for civil\/political rights and those with \nimproving respect for personal integrity rights receive more \naid. As concerns multilateral aid flows, only improvements in \nthe respect for civil\/political rights exert a statistically \nsignificant positive impact on the allocation of aid. \nFew studies addressing bilateral aid flows from donors other \nthan the US have analyzed the role of human rights. Svensson \n(1999) and Alesina and Dollar (2000) examine various donor \ncountry\u2019s aid allocation in pooled regressions covering the \nperiod from 1970 to 1994. The results of these previous \nstudies are compared to the ones from this analysis in the \nconcluding section. \n \n5 \nMeasuring Respect for Human Rights \nAlmost all studies addressing aid allocation for a range of \ndonors exclusively use Freedom House (2000) data for measuring \nthe extent of a government\u2019s respect for political rights and \n(sometimes) civil liberties within a country. Political rights \nrefer to, for example, the existence and fairness of \nelections, the freedom to organize in different political \nparties or groupings, the existence of party competition, \nopposition and the possibility to take over power via \nelections. Civil liberties refer to, for example, the freedom \nof assembly, the right to open and free discussion, the \nindependence of media, the freedom of religious expression, \nthe protection from political terror, the prevalence of the \nrule of law, security of property rights and the freedom to \nundertake business, the freedom to choose marriage partners \nand the size of family. \nThis paper also uses a variable measuring respect for \npersonal integrity rights with data from the two Purdue \nPolitical Terror Scales (PTS) in accordance with most of the \nstudies that specifically look at US aid allocation. Even \nthough there is some overlap with the concept of civil \nliberties from Freedom House, these scales have a much clearer \nfocus on what constitutes arguably the very core of human \nrights and they are not simply redundant.1 One of the two PTS \nis based upon a codification of country information from \nAmnesty International\u2019s annual human rights reports to a scale \n6 \nfrom 1 (best) to 5 (worst). Analogously, the other scale is \nbased upon information from the US Department of State\u2019s \nCountry Reports on Human Rights Practices. Codification is \naccording to rules with regard to the prevalence of political \nimprisonment, disappearances, torture, political murder, and \nother forms of politically motivated violence within a \ncountry. \nThe major difference between personal integrity rights and \nthe political\/civil rights from Freedom House data lies in two \nthings: personal integrity rights violations are without doubt \nnon-excusable and are not subject to the relativist challenge \n(see Perry, 1997). There simply is no justification whatsoever \nfor political imprisonment, torture and murder. Governments \nthat employ or tolerate such activities are guilty of \npolitical terrorism (hence the name of the scales). \nPolitical\/civil rights violations do not carry quite the same \nstatus. One cannot dismiss the argument that these rights are \ncontingent on a particular form of Western culture and that a \ncertain amount of political\/civil rights violations are \nsomehow \u201cnecessary\u201d for the stability of certain countries and \nthe welfare of their people as easily as one can dismiss a \nsimilar argument with respect to political imprisonment, \ntorture and murder (see, for example, Moon and Dixon, 1992). \nIn this sense, McCann and Gibney (1996:16) are correct in \narguing that the PTS refer to \u2018policies within the developing \nworld which all theorists and investigators would agree \n7 \nconstitute egregious miscarriages of political authority\u2019 and \nrepresent \u2018the most serious form of human rights abuses\u2019. \nNote that the measures used in this study only capture what \nis sometimes called first-generation rights, but not economic \nand social rights, sometimes also called second-generation \nrights. There are mainly two reasons for this exclusion. \nFirst, governments can be better held responsible for \nviolations of first-generation rights than for economic and \nsocial rights. Respect for the latter rights can be partly or \nwholly outside the reach of governmental action. It is \ndifficult to discern whether low achievement of economic and \nsocial rights is a consequence of neglect or malevolent \ngovernmental activity or simply the consequence of a country\u2019s \npoverty. Second, and related to this, low achievement of these \nrights might be reason for the receipt of more rather than \nless aid. The reason is the overlap with a country\u2019s need for \nforeign aid. Countries with low gross domestic product (GDP) \nper capita are more in need for foreign aid, but are also less \nlikely to satisfy economic and social rights. \n \nResearch Design \nThe dependent variable. The dependent variable is net official \ndevelopment assistance (ODA) a country receives as a share of \ntotal net ODA allocated in that year by the donor country. ODA \ndata over the period 1985 to 1997 are taken from OECD (2000), \nwhich provides data for all political units in the world \n8 \nreceiving aid, approximately 185 countries and dependent \nterritories. Unfortunately, PTS data are unavailable for many \nof these, particularly the small countries and all the \ndependent territories. The remaining sample comprises a total \nof 105 countries. \n \nThe independent variables. In accordance with the established \nliterature, three kinds of independent variables are used \nhere: need, interest and human rights variables. Also, \npopulation size is used as an explanatory variable to account \nfor differences in the size of countries. In addition, year-\nspecific time dummies are included to account for changes over \ntime that affect all recipient countries equally. \nThe only need variable included is the natural log of GDP \nper capita in purchasing power parity in constant US$1995, \ntaken from World Bank (2000). It is the by far most commonly \nand often only need variable used in the literature \u2013 see \nNeumayer (2003) for an overview of this literature. This is \nbecause it has good data availability and it is highly \ncorrelated with other need variables such as life expectancy, \ninfant mortality or literacy. Neumayer (2003) demonstrates \nthat these other need variables are insignificant once income \nis controlled for in case of most donors. Greater need should \nhave a positive effect both on the probability of receiving \naid as well as on the amount of aid allocated. \n9 \nFour variables are used capturing different aspects of donor \ninterest in line with the existing literature (see Neumayer, \n2003): The first is the number of years the recipient country \nhas been a former colony of the donor in the 20th century \n(Alesina and Dollar, 2000). It is a well established result \nthat many donors favor their former colonies in part at least \nbecause of a political interest in maintaining their influence \non those countries. The second donor interest variable is the \nvalue of exports from the donor country (Gleditsch, 2001). The \nidea is that donors might want to promote their exports in \ngiving more aid to countries that are major recipients of \ntheir good and services. The third variable is the \ngeographical distance between the donor and the recipient \ncountry\u2019s capital (Haveman, 2000).2 This variable can be \nexpected to be significantly negative only for some donors \nthat want to promote a regional sphere of influence in giving \nmore aid to proximate countries, whereas the aid allocation of \nother donors has a more global orientation. The fourth \nvariable attempts to measure a security interest of donors. \nUnfortunately, relevant variables are difficult to find for \nmost donors. We take the military aid a recipient country \nreceives as the share of total US military aid as our proxy \nvariable (USAID 1999). Countries which receive a higher share \nof US military aid can be expected to be of greater importance \nto Western security interests. \n10 \nThe two human rights variables used have already been \nintroduced and justified above. The first is the respect for \npersonal integrity rights based upon the Purdue Political \nTerror Scales (PTS), where the simple average of the two \nindices was taken. If one index was unavailable for a \nparticular year, the other one available was taken over for \nthe aggregate index. The index was then reversed such that 1 \nmeans worst and 5 means best human rights performance. \nThe second variable is the combined political rights and \ncivil liberties index from Freedom House (2000). They are \nbased on expert surveys assessing the extent to which a \ncountry effectively provides for political rights and civil \nliberties, both measured on a 1 (best) to 7 (worst) scale. A \ncombined political\/civil rights index was created by adding \nthe two variables so that the index ranges from 2 to 14, which \nwas then reversed and transformed to a 1 (worst) to 5 (best) \nscale. \n \nMethodology. In accordance with, for example, Cingranelli and \nPasquarello (1985) and Poe and Sirirangasi (1994), I assume a \ntwo-year lag of the independent variables, since decision-\nmakers are unlikely to have more recent data available at the \ntime they allocate aid flows. This lagging of the independent \nvariables should also reduce any potential problems of \nsimultaneity. \n11 \nAssessing the impact that respect for human rights has on \nthe allocation of aid has to deal with the fact that not only \ndo countries receive different amounts of aid, but some \ncountries do not receive any aid at all from particular \ndonors. In our sample, the share of positive observations \nranges from as high as about 96 per cent in the case of France \nto as low as around 8 per cent in the case of Portugal. There \nare basically two options for dealing with this clustering of \nzero observations. One is to follow the lead of Cingranelli \nand Pasquarello (1985) and many others and to distinguish \nbetween two stages in the process of aid allocation. The first \nstage is the so-called gate-keeping stage where it is \ndetermined which countries receive aid. The appropriate \nestimation technique for this kind of analysis is probit, \nwhich is used throughout.3 The second stage is the level stage \nwhere it is determined how much aid as a share of total aid is \nallocated to a country, which has been selected as an aid \nrecipient in the first stage. All regressions at this stage \nwere estimated via ordinary least squares (OLS). One of the \nproblems with this two-stage method is that it assumes that \nthe errors in both stages are uncorrelated. In other words, it \nassumes that decisions at the gate-keeping stage are taken \nindependently from the decisions at the level stage. \nThe second method is Heckman\u2019s (1979) two-step estimator, \nwhich explicitly allows the error terms from both stages of \naid allocation to be correlated. However, the two-step \n12 \nestimator works best with an exclusionary variable that has a \nsignificant impact upon the first step (gate-keeping stage), \nbut not upon the second step (level stage). Otherwise the \nvalidity of estimations depends on restrictive distributional \nassumptions only. The problem is that such an exclusionary \nvariable is frequently impossible to find. Another \ndisadvantage of Heckman\u2019s two-step estimator is that the model \nis highly sensitive towards model specification and \nestimations can be unstable. Due to these problems the two-\nstage method was used for reporting the main results, but \nHeckman\u2019s two-step estimator was used in sensitivity analysis. \nThe dependent variable was logged in order to reduce the \ninfluence of outliers. All independent variables with the \nexception of the human rights variables were logged as well. \nDoing so allows an easy to understand elasticity \ninterpretation of the estimated coefficient in the second \nstage estimations. The human rights variables were not logged \nsince they are not cardinal variables with the consequence \nthat it would be non-sensical to speak of a percentage \nincrease in respect for human rights. The main results are not \naffected by whether or not the independent variables are \nlogged. Since Cook-Weisberg tests rejected the hypothesis of \nconstant variance, standard errors were used that are robust \ntowards arbitrary heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation. \n \n13 \nGrouping donors. To guide our analysis, we distinguish three \ngroups of donors: The big aid donors (France, Germany, Italy, \nJapan, the UK and the US), the so-called like-minded countries \n(Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden) and the \nremaining smaller donors. The big aid donors are commonly \nregarded as pursuing their own interest, which might leave \nlittle room for promoting human rights (Svensson, 1999). The \nlike-minded countries traditionally see poverty alleviation as \nthe main objective of their aid giving. They are also commonly \nviewed as paying little regard to their own interest and as \nbeing committed to the pursuit of human rights in their \nforeign policy in general, and their aid allocation in \nparticular (Toma\u0161evski, 1993; Gillies, 1999; Neumayer, 2003). \nThe small aid donors are somewhat in between the other two \ngroups as concerns respect for human rights: they are perhaps \nfreer to promote respect for human rights in their aid \nallocation than the big aid donors, but they do not have a \nstrong reputation of being committed to human rights as the \nlike-minded countries do. \n \nResults \nTable 1 provides probit estimation results of the gate keeping \nstage. The reported coefficients are not probit coefficients, \nwhich have no intuitive interpretation. Instead, they are \nalready transformed into changes in the probability following \n14 \na marginal increase at the mean of a variable, with all other \nindependent variables held at their mean values as well.4 \n< Table 1 about here > \nPoorer countries have a higher chance of being eligible for \naid receipt for all donors but Portugal. Population size has \nno consistent effect, but most donors, particularly the small \nones, select more populous countries with higher probability. \nWith the exception of Japan and the Netherlands, all donors \ngive preference to their own colonies at this stage.5 In the \ncase of Japan this is due to the traditionally problematic \nrelationship between the donor and its former colonies, which \nwere occupied during the Second World War. In the case of the \nNetherlands, it is due to a temporary withdrawal of Dutch aid \nto Indonesia in the mid-1990s due to anger about Indonesian \npolitics in particular towards East Timor. Countries that \nreceive a higher share of US military aid as well as those \nthat import more from the donor are more likely to be eligible \nfor the receipt of aid by most donors. Geographical distance \ndoes not exert a consistent influence at the aid eligibility \nstage. Only Australia, New Zealand and Portugal have a \nregional bias at this stage.6 \nAs concerns human rights, there are only few donors that \ngive preference to countries with a good record on personal \nintegrity rights. Indeed, in the case of Sweden, Luxembourg, \nNew Zealand, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland, countries with a \npoor record are actually more likely to be eligible for aid \n15 \nreceipt. The situation is entirely different with respect to \ncivil and political rights. With the exception of Germany, \nAustralia, Austria, Ireland and Portugal, all donors give \npreference to countries with a good record on such rights. \nComparing across groups of countries, no consistent pattern \nemerges. Most countries take recipient need as well as some \naspect of donor interest into account. As concerns human \nrights, the like-minded countries do not stand out as a group. \nDenmark is the only like-minded country to give preference \nboth to countries with greater respect for personal integrity \nrights and to those with greater respect for civil and \npolitical rights. The smaller donors fare no better than the \nbig donors. \nResults from the level stage are reported in table 2. With \nthe exception of Luxembourg, New Zealand and Portugal all \ndonors allocate a higher share of their aid to poorer \ncountries. As expected, the income elasticity for the like-\nminded donor countries is quite high in absolute terms \ndemonstrating their commitment to poverty alleviation.7 The \nmajority of donors also allocate a higher share to countries \nwith a greater population size as one would expect. Note that \nthe estimated elasticity for the population variable is \nclearly below one for all donors, which confirms the so-called \npopulation bias in aid allocation already suggested by Isenman \n(1976): more populous countries receive more aid, but the aid \nincrease is less than the proportional population increase. \n16 \nWith the exception of Japan and the United States, all \ndonors give a greater percentage of aid to their former \ncolonies. For Japan, the reason is analogous to its bias \nagainst its former colonies at the gate-keeping stage. For the \nUS, such a bias is highly implausible. The Philippines is the \nonly US colony in our sample with traditionally good relations \nto its former colonial power. If the variable \u2018US military \naid\u2019 were not included in the model, then the colony variable \nwould become positive. The colony variable is insignificant in \nour model because the effect is picked up by the \u2018US military \naid\u2019 variable. \nAll big donors with the exception of the UK, give more aid \nto countries which receive high shares of US military aid. \nWith the exception of Canada (a close ally of the US), none of \nthe like-minded countries does, which is in line with our \nexpectations. All the big donors promote their exports in \ngiving more aid to major importers of their goods and \nservices. On this aspect, the like-minded countries are not \nfree of pursuing their interest in aid giving as they also \ngive more aid to major importing countries, with the exception \nof the Netherlands. The small donors vary on both of these \naspects of donor interest. As concerns a regional bias, our \nresults confirm what is commonly known about certain donors: \nGermany, Austria and Switzerland give some preference to \nEastern European and Mediterranean countries, Japan to East \nAsian countries, the US to Latin American and finally \n17 \nAustralia and New Zealand to Pacific recipient countries. The \nother donors do not share this regional bias. \nAs concerns human rights, there is no consistent pattern \nacross donors. With respect to personal integrity rights, \nFrance, Japan, the UK, Canada, Denmark and Australia provide \ncountries with a good record with a higher share of aid. The \nopposite is true for Italy, the US, the Netherlands, Norway, \nLuxembourg and Spain. The variable tests insignificantly for \nthe remaining countries. There is no systematic difference \nbetween the big aid donors, the like-minded countries and the \nsmall donors. As concerns civil and political rights, the \nresults paint a similarly complex picture. Germany, Japan, the \nUK, the Netherlands, Norway and Switzerland give more aid to \ncountries with a good record. The opposite is true for France, \nAustralia, Austria and Belgium, whereas civil and political \nrights exert no statistically significant influence on aid \nallocation by the remaining countries. Again, there is no \nsystematic difference apparent across the groups of aid \ndonors. \n< Table 2 about here > \nSensitivity analysis \nIt is sometimes suggested that the US Department of State\u2019s \nCountry Reports on Human Rights Practices are subject to some \nideologically motivated bias. Poe, Carey and Vazquez (2001) \ntest this hypothesis and find some limited evidence that at \ntimes, particularly in the early years, the US Department of \n18 \nState favoured allies of the US in its reports and was biased \nagainst its enemies. Replacing the variable used in the \nregressions reported above, which combined the PTS derived \nfrom the US Department of State\u2019s and amnesty international\u2019s \nreports, with the one based on the latter only leads to \nbroadly the same results.  \nOne might wonder whether human rights exert a greater \ninfluence in the post Cold War period (1991-1997) as compared \nto the period of the Cold War (1985-1990). However, this is \nnot the case. Breaking down the sample into two sub-periods \ndid not suggest any systematically enhanced role of human \nrights in the post Cold War period. One might also be \nconcerned about multicollinearity given that the two aspects \nof human rights are correlated with each other. However, \nvariance inflation factors were computed and were all well \nbelow 5. Also, including each of the two human rights \nvariables in isolation leads to broadly the same result as \ntheir simultaneous inclusion. Using Heckman\u2019s two-step \nestimator instead of the two-stage method also hardly affects \nthe estimation results on the human rights variables. Given \nthat for many donors a Wald test fails to reject the \nhypothesis of independent equations at the two stages, this \nresult is not very surprising, since the two-stage method \nassumes independence of the two equations. \n \n19 \nConcluding Observations \nExisting studies that look at the role of personal integrity \nrights in addition to civil\/political rights have focussed on \nUS aid allocation. Studies looking at aid allocation by other \ndonors have not included personal integrity rights. This \narticle has attempted to fill this gap. Indeed, to the best of \nmy knowledge, it is the first study analyzing comprehensively \nthe role of human rights in the allocation of aid of all the \n21 member countries of the OECD\u2019s Development Assistance \nCommittee. \nThe results reported above convey a mixed picture of the \nrole human rights play in the allocation of aid. On the one \nhand, respect for civil\/political rights is a statistically \nsignificant determinant on whether a country is deemed \neligible for the receipt of aid for most donors. Respect for \nthese rights thus clearly plays a role as a gate-keeper for \nmost donors. Respect for personal integrity rights, on the \nother hand, is insignificant for most donors. At the level \nstage, respect for civil\/political rights and respect for \npersonal integrity rights exert a positive influence on the \npattern of aid giving of only few donors. \nTable 3 compares our results at the level stage to those of \nSvensson (1999) and Alesina and Dollar (2000), the only \nstudies addressing the impact of civil\/political rights on aid \nallocation by donors other than the US. Our results with \nrespect to the effect of civil\/political rights on aid \n20 \nallocation are consistent with at least one of these studies \nin the case of France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, the US, \nthe Netherlands and Norway. For Canada and Denmark, Svensson \n(1999) finds a positive effect of civil\/political rights. Our \nstudy suggests that it is personal integrity rights instead, \nwhich matter for these two donors, and that Svensson\u2019s result \nis due to model mis-specification given that he does not \ncontrol for these rights. A similar argument applies to \nAustralia, for which Alesina and Dollar (2000) report a \npositive effect of civil\/political rights, whereas our results \nsuggest again that it is personal integrity rights which \nmatter. Only in the case of Sweden does our study fail to find \nany positive effect of human rights on aid allocation contrary \nto Svensson\u2019s (1999) result. As concerns the US, our results \nconfirm Poe and Sirirangsi\u2019s (1994) finding that human rights \nmatter at the aid eligibility stage and not at the level stage \nas suggested by Cingranelli and Pasquarello (1985). \n< Insert Table 3 about here > \nOne of the major results of this paper is that the like-\nminded countries do not fare better as a group than the other \ndonors in spite of usually being portrayed (not least by \nthemselves) as committed to the pursuit of human rights. This \ndoes stand in contrast to Svensson (1999) and Alesina and \nDollar (2000). What this paper has shown is that the impact of \nhuman rights on aid allocation by these countries is much less \nconsistent than the other studies would suggest. The \n21 \nNetherlands and Norway indeed provide more aid to countries \nwith higher respect for civil\/political rights, but also less \naid to countries with higher respect for personal integrity \nrights. Canada and Denmark provide more aid to countries with \nhigher respect for personal integrity rights, but not \ncivil\/political rights. Indeed, there are only two countries \n(Japan, UK), which give more aid to countries with greater \nrespect for both aspects of human rights, and they belong to \nthe group of big aid donors, not like-minded countries. \nAll in all, the results reported in this study are rather \nsobering from a normative point of view. Respect for human \nrights does not exert a consistent influence on aid allocation \nby most donors. There is inconsistency across the two stages \nof aid giving as well as across the different aspects of human \nrights. There is not a single donor, which would consistently \nscreen out countries with low respect for civil\/political and \npersonal integrity rights and would give more aid to countries \nwith higher respect for both aspects of human rights. If \ndonors want to appear less hypocritical about their commitment \nto the pursuit of human rights, then our analysis suggests \nthat they still have a long way to go. \n22 \nNOTES\n                                                 \n1 Indeed, the partial Pearson correlation coefficient is not \nvery high (r = .21; n = 1262). \n2 Distance to Sweden functioned as a proxy for Denmark, \nFinland and Norway; Spain as a proxy for Portugal; the United \nKingdom as a proxy for Ireland and Australia as a proxy for \nNew Zealand. \n3 Alternatively, logit estimation could have been undertaken. \nThe two techniques provide very similar results in standard \nsituations. \n4 Note that the probabilities are contingent on specific \nvalues of the independent variables because the probit model \nis nonlinear, and therefore nonadditive, in the probabilities. \n5 The result \u201c100% success\u201d means that all colonies are given \naid in all years. Note that due to statistical reasons, these \nobservations need to be dropped and the estimated \nprobabilities refer to the remaining observations only. \n6 Australia and New Zealand notoriously concentrate their aid \nin the Pacific region. \n7 Note, however, that the income elasticity of Italy, Japan \nand Finland is also very high. \n23 \nREFERENCES \nAbrams, Burton A. and Kenneth A.
