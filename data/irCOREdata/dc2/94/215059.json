This aggregate statis-\ntic, however, obscures considerable variation \nin intrafirm intensity across import partners as \nwell as products. Indeed, while 74 percent of US \nimports from Japan are intrafirm, the figure for \nBangladesh is just two percent. Likewise, trade \nbetween related parties accounted for two per-\ncent of US imports of rubber and plastic foot-\nwear, but more than 70 percent of US imports \nof autos, medical equipment, and instruments. \nThere is also significant variation in intrafirm \nintensity across countries within products. Photo \nFilms, Plates and Chemicals (North American \nIndustry Classification System 325992), for \nexample, ranks fifth overall in terms of the \nshare of intrafirm trade, but half of the countries \nfrom which it is sourced (by value) exported it \nto the United States almost completely at arm\u2019s \nlength.1\n1 A longer version of this paper, Bernard, Jensen, \nRedding, and Schott (forthcoming), contains additional \nresults and is available on the AER Web site (http:\/\/www.\naeaweb.org\/articles.php?doi=10.1257\/aer.99.2.487) and \nfrom the authors.\nIntrafirm Trade and Product Contractibility\nBy Andrew B. Bernard, J. Bradford Jensen, Stephen J. Redding, \nand Peter K. Schott*\nThese figures highlight the importance of \nproduct and country characteristics\u2014and \n especially their interaction\u2014in explaining \nintrafirm trade. Such factors are emphasized in \nrecent theoretical models of multinational firms \nthat stress the role of contracting in firms\u2019 deci-\nsions both to source components in-house versus \nat arm\u2019s length and to locate production at home \nversus abroad.2 These models differ from earlier \ntheories of multinationals in their emphasis on \nthe costs associated with writing contracts for \nspecialized inputs and the attention they pay to \ntraded intermediate goods.\nGuided by these models, we examine the \nproduct and country determinants of intrafirm \ntrade.3 In particular, we introduce a new mea-\nsure of products\u2019 revealed contractibility based \non the idea that contracting likely is easier for \nproducts passing through intermediaries such as \nwholesalers. We find that both this measure and \ncountries\u2019 governance quality are associated \nwith variation in intrafirm trade in interesting \nand intuitive ways, and that factors associated \nwith engaging in related-party trade differ from \nthose associated with the intensity of intrafirm \ntrade once a link is established. Higher qual-\nity country governance, for example, is associ-\nated with a higher probability of related-party \ntrade taking place. Further increases in quality, \nhowever, coincide with lower shares of related-\nparty trade, presumably due to the greater ease \nwith which arm\u2019s length contracts can be writ-\nten. With respect to interactions of product and \ncountry attributes, improvements in country \ngovernance lead to the largest reductions in \nintrafirm trade in low contractibility products.\n2 See, for example, Pol Antr\u00e0s (2003), Antr\u00e0s and \nElhanan Helpman (2004), and Gene M. Grossman and \nHelpman (2005).\n3 Our findings complement existing empirical exami-\nnations of intrafirm trade by Gregory Corcos, Delphine \nIrac, Giordano Mion, and Thierry Verdier (2008), Fabrice \nDefever and Farid Toubal (2007), Nathan Nunn and Daniel \nTrefler (2008) and Stephen R.

Data\nWe use the US Linked\/Longitudinal Firm \nTrade Transaction Database (LFTTD), which \nlinks individual US trade transactions to US \nfirms.4 Import transactions take place between \nrelated parties if either party owns, directly or \nindirectly, six percent or more of the other party. \nTo align Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) \nproduction and HS trade data, and to expand the \nsample of countries on which data on country \ncharacteristics are available, we focus on the \nyear 1997.\nTo explore the role of various country char-\nacteristics discussed below, we combine these \ntrade data with measures of physical capital \nabundance, human capital abundance, and \npopulation from Robert E. Hall and Charles I. \nJones (1999), a composite index of countries\u2019 \ngovernance quality from the World Bank, and \nmeasures of trade and foreign direct investment \n(FDI) protection from Heritage Foundation\/\nWSJ (2006).5 We measure products\u2019 capital \nand skill intensity using data from the 1997 US \nCensus of Manufactures. We assign all ten-digit \nHS products within a particular four-digit SIC \nindustry the average capital or skill (nonproduc-\ntion workers as a share of employment) intensity \nof all plants whose output is concentrated in that \nindustry. Industry headquarters intensity is mea-\nsured by the average share of firm employment \nat headquarters and auxiliary establishments.6\nWe assume that products passing through \nintermediaries are the easiest over which to con-\ntract. As a result, we measure products\u2019 revealed \ncontractibility as the weighted average whole-\nsale employment share of firms importing the \nproduct, using firms\u2019 import value as weights,\n(1)\u2003 \u2003 IMEdp\u2003 =  \u2211\u2003\nf\n  \n \n \nWf\n _____\u2003\nEMPf\n   \nMpf\n ___\u2003\nMp\n  .\n4 See Bernard, Jensen, and Schott (2009) for more \ndetails.\n5 We use factor analysis to create a univariate measure \nof country governance for 1996 from the six World Bank \nmeasures reported by Daniel Kaufman, Aart Kraay, and \nMassimo Mastruzzi (2006). The first factor upon which we \nfocus accounts for around 90 percent of the variance of the \nsix measures.\n6 For further discussion of the data definitions and \nsources, see Bernard et al. (2010).\nThe first term in the intermediation measure \nis the share of wholesale employment (Wf ) \nin firm f  \u2019s total employment (EMPf ).7 The \nsecond term is the import share of firm f in \nten-digit HS product market p, with Mpf and \nMp representing firm f  \u2019s imports of product \np and total US imports of product p, respec-\ntively. Intermediation ranges between zero and \nunity:  if no firms importing product p have \nany wholesale establishments, IMEdp = 0. On \nthe other hand, if product p is imported exclu-\nsively by firms with 100 percent employment in \nwholesaling, IMEdp = 1.\nIntermediation and intrafirm import shares \nare inversely related across two-digit HS cat-\negories, as shown in Figure 1. There is, how-\never, substantial independent variation in the \ntwo variables, as industries with similar lev-\nels of intermediation span a wide range of \nintrafirm intensity. Footwear (HS 64) and \nOrganic Chemicals (HS 29), for example, have \ncomparable levels of intermediation, 0.135 and \n0.136 respectively. However, more than half of \nOrganic Chemicals imports are conducted by \nrelated parties, while the intrafirm trade share \nfor Footwear is less than ten percent.\nII.\u2002 Determinants of Intrafirm Trade\nOur empirical analysis uses cross-sectional \ndata on intrafirm and total US imports of prod-\nuct p from country c in 1997. Our empirical \n specification regresses measures of intrafirm \ntrade (IFpc ) on product characteristics (Xp ), \ncountry characteristics (Zc ), and interactions \nbetween product and country characteristics (Xp\u2003\u00d7\u2003Zc ):\n(2)\u2003 \u2003IFpc\u2003 = \u03b8 + \u03b1Xp +\u2003\u03b2Zc + \u03b3\u2003(Xp\u2003Zc) + \u03f5pc\u2003.\nWe consider two measures of intrafirm trade: \nthe share of intrafirm imports in US imports, \nwhich we refer to as the \u201cintensive\u201d margin, \nand a dummy variable which is equal to one if \nthere are positive intrafirm imports for a prod-\nuct and country, which we call the \u201cextensive\u201d \n7 We observe employment and major industry at the \nestablishment level. We assign all employees in an estab-\nlishment to the major industry of that establishment. Firms \nwith a single establishment necessarily have 100 percent \nemployment in a single industry. Wholesale is NAICS sec-\ntor 42.\nMAy 2010446 AEA PAPERS ANd PROcEEdINGS\nmargin. In constructing the interaction terms, \nwe  subtract the sample mean from each vari-\nable entering the interaction term. This nor-\nmalization ensures that the main effects of each \nvariable can be interpreted as the effect at the \nsample mean.\nOur choice of product and country charac-\nteristics is motivated by the recent theoretical \nliterature on contractual frictions and inter-\nnational trade. This literature emphasizes the \nrelative importance of relationship specific \ninvestments by headquarters and supplier \nfirms and the degree of contractibility of these \ninvestments. In Antr\u00e0s (2003), capital inten-\nsity captures the relative importance of head-\nquarters\u2019 investments, and hence we include \nindustry capital intensity and country capital \nabundance. To allow for the possibility that \nother factor intensities matter, we also include \nindustry skill intensity and country skill abun-\ndance. In Antr\u00e0s and Helpman (2004), head-\nquarters investments are interpreted more \nbroadly, and hence we include our direct mea-\nsure of headquarters intensity discussed above. \nIn Grossman and Helpman (2005), the degree \nof contractibility of relationship specific invest-\nments can vary with, for example, product and \ncountry characteristics, and hence we include \nrevealed product contractibility and country \ngovernance as further independent variables. \nFinally, we explore the impact of policy based \nbarriers by including measures of trade and \nFDI protection as country characteristics.\nTable 1 reports the results of estimat-\ning specification (2). Columns 1 and 3 use the \nextensive margin as the dependent variable, so \nthe sample comprises all product-country cells \nwith positive imports, including those with zero \nintrafirm trade. Columns 2 and 4 focus on the \nintensive margin, and the sample is all obser-\nvations with positive intrafirm trade. Columns \n3 and 4 control for the nonrandom selection of \nobservations with positive intrafirm imports \nusing the Heckman two-stage estimation proce-\ndure. The two stages are separately identified by \nfunctional form and the excluded variable from \nthe second-stage regression. For the excluded \nvariable, we choose the cost of phone calls to \nthe United States, which arguably affects the \nfixed costs of establishing an affiliate but not the \nrelative variable costs of intrafirm versus arm\u2019s \nlength trade.8\nConsistent with the recent theoretical literature \non contractual frictions in international trade, \nwe find in columns 1 and 2 that higher revealed \nproduct contractibility is associated with less \nintrafirm trade on both the extensive and inten-\nsive margins. We also find that the sign on the \nquality of country governance changes between \ncolumns 1 and 2. Increases in governance qual-\nity raise the probability that foreign affiliates are \npresent (column 1) but are associated with lower \nshares of intrafirm trade conditional on positive \nintrafirm trade occurring (column 2). This result \nsuggests good governance promotes the estab-\nlishment of related-party trade but not its inten-\nsity once established, which is  consistent with \nthe idea that arm\u2019s length contracting is easier \nin countries with good governance. Similar \n nonlinearities are present for population and \nFDI protection.\nResults in Table 1 also indicate the relevance \nof interactions of product and country charac-\nteristics in determining intrafirm trade.

The \npositive coefficient on the interaction between \nindustry capital intensity and country capital \nabundance implies that intrafirm trade shares are \nhigh for capital intensive products coming from \ncapital abundant countries. In contrast to previ-\nous work, we also find a role for industry skill \nintensity and country skill abundance. The main \neffects of industry skill intensity on intrafirm \ntrade are positive for both the intensive and exten-\nsive margins; the main effects of country human \ncapital abundance are negative; and the estimated \ncoefficients on the skill interaction terms are neg-\native. Therefore, greater industry skill intensity \nincreases the share of intrafirm trade and leads to \nlarger increases in more skill scarce countries. In \ncontrast, greater country skill abundance reduces \nthe share of intrafirm trade, and leads to larger \nreductions in more skill intensive products.\nIII. Conclusions\nThe literature on firms and international trade \nhas focused attention on issues of contracting \nand the boundaries of the firm. This research \nspeaks to policy issues surrounding the growth \nof outsourcing, offshoring and international \nproduction networks.\nOur results provide evidence on the role of \ncountry governance and product contractibility \nin determining intrafirm trade. We find evidence \nof selection: the decision to establish a foreign \naffiliate in a country differs from the choice of \nhow much to source from the affiliate once it is \nestablished. While affiliates are more likely to \nbe situated in countries that are larger and have \nbetter governance, once affiliates exist, the share \nof intrafirm trade is negatively related to both \ncountry size and country governance quality. Our \nresults also highlight interactions between country \nand product characteristics\u2014e.g., improvements \nin country governance matter most for products \nfor which contracting is relatively difficult.\n9 Bernard et al.
