Introduction\nEven though the existence of lymphatic vessels has been known since the seventeenth\ncentury, until very recently, not very much was known about their functioning and devel-\nopment. This was due to a failure to understand their importance in the proper functioning\nof tissues. However, in last the 10 years, lymphatics have come to the forefront of bio-\nmedical research, largely due to findings highlighting their importance to cancer growth\nand metastasis (Stacker et al., 2002). Thus, there are now a large number of experimental\nstudies on the molecular and micromechanical factors that control lymphatic function and\ndevelopment.\n\u2217Corresponding author.\nE-mail address: roose@maths.ox.ac.uk (Tiina Roose).\n1This work was supported by the Royal Society (London) by the award of a University Research Fellow-\nship.\nRoose and Fowler\nThe fundamental role of lymphatics is to collect excess interstitial fluids, tissue waste\nproducts, and plasma proteins from tissue and return them to the blood. Tissues require\nfluid and nutrients and these are supplied to them by blood vessels. After the fluid has per-\nformed its function, it is reabsorbed either by the lymphatics or by post capillary venules;\nthe dominant contribution in most cases being due to the lymphatics. Thus, when the lym-\nphatic system is unable to function, the interstitial pressure becomes heightened and the\ntissues become swollen. In addition, since reabsorption drives the flow of fluids through\ntissues, failure of the lymphatic system usually results in much slower, mainly diffusive,\nmovement of nutrients into tissues, and the accumulation of waste products. In order to\nperform its important task, the lymphatic system has evolved into an elaborate, highly\nbranched, highly valved, drainage network. In addition to its primary task, the lymphatic\nsystem also plays an important part in the immune system. In particular, lymphocytes,\nwhich reside and multiply in the lymphatic system, clean lymph fluid of bacteria and\nother contaminants. Thus, diseases of the lymphatic system often result in compromised\nimmune competence.\nMany medical conditions have now been linked to a malfunctioning of the lymphatic\nsystem, for example lymphedema, Melkersson\u2013Rosenthal\u2013Meischer syndrome, Kaposi\nsarcoma, and lymphatic filariasis. Lymphatic filariasis is a parasitic disease that is thought\nto be globally the second leading cause of permanent and long-term disability (Jussila and\nAlitalo, 2002). In recent years, the lack of lymphatic function in solid tumors has been\nidentified as one cause for hindered delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs to solid tumors\n(Jain, 2001). Tumor metastasis is also thought to involve lymphatics as one, if not the\nprimary, pathway (Cassella and Skobe, 2002; Skobe et al., 2001; Stacker et al., 2002).\nIn this paper, we will derive a model that sheds some light on the aspects that control\nlymphatic vessel development, i.e., lymphangiogenesis. In particular, we concentrate our\nefforts on trying to explain the experimental findings of Boardman and Swartz (2003).\nBoardman and Swartz found that the development of the lymphatic network within a\ncollagen implant in a mouse tail is preceded by the development of a fluid flow network\nwithin it. Thus, it appears that collagen prepatterning plays a role in guiding the lymphatic\ndevelopment. In particular, it precedes the migration of the lymphatic endothelial cells.\nAlthough there are several authors who have noted the existence of preferential fluid\nflow channels and networks in the tissue and calculated their transport properties (Landis\nand Pappenheimer, 1963; Levick, 1987; Watson et al., 1980; Watson and Grodins, 1978)\nto our knowledge there are no detailed mathematical models describing the development\nof this network in biogels or living tissues. Cogan and Keener (2005) develop a model\nfor the development of a single channel between two constraining boundaries. However,\nwe will show that more complex structures, which are reminiscent of a mature primary\nlymphatic network, could come about in a collagen gel.\nIn their landmark experiments, Boardman and Swartz (2003) cut away a small thin\ncircular layer of skin around the tail of a mouse where the lymphatics reside leaving the\nvascular structure of the mouse tail intact. They then filled this area with 3% collagen\nand saw that before the lymphatic endothelial cells migrated into this collagen implant\nspontaneous fluid flow network had formed within the implant. Although the experiments\nneed to be refined, using higher spatial and temporal resolution, we hypothesize that these\nchannels were formed due to the intricate interplay between the collagen gel and the\nsolutes (in particular protons) that infiltrated the gel after it was transplanted around the\nmouse tail. Collagen is a fibrous protein that makes up most of the connective tissue\nNetwork Development in Biological Gels: Role in Lymphatic Vessel\nFig. 1 Figure showing the visualization of lympatic network in the mouse tail.

It consists of long thin fibres that are bound together to give\nstrength to the tissue. In between the fibres, one finds an interstitial fluid. Crucially, it\nhas been found that collagen gels, and hence also biological tissues, can swell and be\nbroken down by acidic pH (Nussbaum, 1986; Nussbaum and Grodzinsky, 1981). We will\nmodel the interaction between the elastic\/rubber like properties of collagen and protons\nwith the aim of explaining how this can lead to development of a fluid flow network with\na morphology that is similar to the one found in experiments of Boardman and Swartz\n(2003) (see also Fig. 1).\nIn Section 2, we will derive a model for the collagen gel and proton interaction based\non the theory by Flory for long chain polymeric mixtures by considering the free energy\nof the mixture. This results in two coupled fourth order equations for the collagen volume\nfraction and the proton concentration. In Section 3, we will present the linear stability\nanalysis of the model and show that for proton concentration above a certain level, a\nspatially uniform steady state is unstable to small random perturbations, and thus spatial\npatterns will develop. In Section 4, we use the results of the linear stability analysis to\nguide us on reducing the order of the system by conducting a long wavelength reduction\nof the coupled equations that results in a single reduced equation for the collagen volume\nfraction. The equation that we derive is similar to the Cahn\u2013Hilliard equation, however, it\nhas more complicated nonlinearities and degeneracies. We solve this equation numerically\nusing finite element simulations that have been confirmed using a spectral method. Finally,\nin Section 5, we discuss our results and outline the future avenues of research.\n2. Model development\nWe consider the collagen implant to consist of two phases, the fibre phase \u03c6, and the fluid\nphase 1 \u2212 \u03c6. Conservation equations for these two phases can be written as\n\u03c6t + \u2207 \u00b7 (\u03c6vp) = 0, and \u2212 \u03c6t + \u2207 \u00b7\n[\n(1 \u2212 \u03c6)vf\n] = 0, (1)\nwhere vp is the fibre velocity, vf is the fluid velocity, and \u03c6t is shorthand for \u2202\u03c6\/\u2202t .\nRoose and Fowler\nSimilarly to Milner (1993), Tanaka (1997), we define the volume averaged velocity to\nbe\nv = \u03c6vp + (1 \u2212 \u03c6)vf . (2)\nTherefore, it follows from the conservation equations (1) that\n\u2207 \u00b7 v = 0. (3)\nWe assume that the solute, i.e., protons, matrix metalloproteases, etc., is present in the\nfluid phase of the implant, and that this solute can be carried by the convective movement\nof fluid and it can also diffuse in the fluid phase. Thus, we take the equation for the solute\nconcentration c to be given by\nct + \u2207 \u00b7\n[\nc(1 \u2212 \u03c6)vf\n] = \u2207 \u00b7 [D(\u03c6)\u2207c], (4)\nwhere ct = \u2202c\/\u2202t and D(\u03c6) = D0e\u2212a\u03c6b is the effective diffusion of solute in the fluid\nphase (Clague and Phillips, 1997). In this equation, we are assuming that there are no\nsource or sink terms for solute within the sample. We believe this to be a reasonable\nassumption in the case of protons, for example, which are usually abundant in the fluid\nphase and any depletion of them due to their interaction with collagen can be considered\nnegligible. Also, since the collagen implant is acellular, it is reasonable to assume that\nthere are no source terms for c present inside the implant.\nWe now need to derive expressions that describe the fibre and fluid velocities, vp and\nvf , respectively. We follow the approach first outlined by Flory (1953) for rubber elas-\nticity by assuming that collagen behaves, as a first approximation, similarly to long chain\nrubber molecules. For this approach, we need to describe the interaction between the col-\nlagen fibres and the fluid. After Boudaoud and Caieb (2003), Flory (1953) and others,\nwe consider the free energy of the gel to be a sum of three terms: the fluid-collagen in-\nteraction energy (Finteraction), the fibre network elastic energy (Felastic), and the correlation\nenergy (Fcorrelation). Thus, the total energy of the collagen gel is given by\nF = Finteraction + Felastic + Fcorrelation. (5)\nWe will now discuss each of these three terms briefly.\nFollowing Boissonade (2003), Flory (1953), Wolgemuth et al. (2004), the interaction\nterm is given by\nFinteraction =\n\u222b\n\u03a9\nfinteraction dV, (6)\nwhere fintraction is the free energy density of the interaction that determines the number\nand stability of different possible phases. It is usually derived in statistical mechanics by\nconsidering, for example, the configurations that different Gaussian chains can take in a\ngiven solvent (Doi and Edwards, 1986; Doi, 1983). Here, we take it to be given by the\nFlory\u2013Huggins expression (Flory, 1953)\nfinteraction = kBT\n\u03bd\n{\n(1 \u2212 \u03c6) ln(1 \u2212 \u03c6) + \u03c7\u03c6(1 \u2212 \u03c6)}, (7)\nNetwork Development in Biological Gels: Role in Lymphatic Vessel\nwhere kBT is the thermal energy, \u03c7 is the Flory fiber-solvent interaction parameter, and\n\u03bd is the volume of the monomer (Flory, 1953; Wolgemuth et al., 2004). The first term\nexpresses the entropic contribution to the free energy and the second term expresses the\nenthalpic contribution.\nSimilarly, Flory (1953) derived an expression for an elastic energy that would be\npresent in a network of cross-linked long chain molecules, i.e., Felastic =\n\u222b\n\u03a9\nfelastic dV ,\nwhere\nfelastic = kBT\n\u03bd\n1\n2Nx\n(\n\u03c60 \u2212 \u03c6 \u2212 13\u03c6 ln\n\u03c60\n\u03c6\n)\n, (8)\nwhere Nx is the number of monomers between the cross-links, and \u03c60 is the equilib-\nrium\/initial polymer volume fraction.\nWe take the correlation energy to be given by classical Orstein\u2013Zernike form for free\nenergy (Boudaoud and Caieb, 2003; Wolgemuth et al., 2004), i.e.,\nFcorrelation =\n\u222b\n\u03a9\nk\n2\n(\u2207\u03c6)2 dV, (9)\nwhere k is proportional to correlation length.\nCrucially, in this paper, we will hypothesize that the distance between the cross-links\nNx , and, therefore, the elastic energy of the gel is a function of chemicals in the fluid\nphase, i.e., we assume that the chemicals in the fluid phase can break down the cross-links\nand lead to swelling in the absence of other forces; an observation that is supported by\nthe experiments of Nussbaum (1986), Nussbaum and Grodzinsky (1981) on the swelling\nof collagen gel due to changes in solute (for example, proton) concentration. Motivated\nby this, we take the average distance between the cross-links to be a function of solute\nconcentration\nNx = Nx0e\u03b1\nc\u2212c0\nc\u221e\u2212c , (10)\nwhere Nx0 is the average equilibrium distance between the cross-links at the reference\nstate c0, and c\u221e is the concentration of solute in the fluid phase when the cross-links\nhave completely disappeared, i.e., when Nx \u2192 \u221e. This is, of course, a phenomenological\nfunction and the choice of it was determined by the qualitative behavior observed in the\ncited experiments. In the absence of any detailed experimental evidence, we are not going\nto worry about the exact functional form of Nx . Instead, we will be interested only in the\nearly stages of patterning and, therefore, in the linear stability analysis shown later only,\nthe value of dNx\/dc, evaluated at the reference state, influences the onset of fluid network\ndevelopment.\nSeveral authors have also included a counterion pressure term, that is, in particular, de-\npendent on the pH and other chemicals found in the solvent, in the free energy derivation\npresented above (Dobrynin and Rubinstein, 2005; Yashin and Balazs, 2006). However,\nwe will not include this term in this paper for the following reasons. First, because the\nexperiments of Boardman and Swartz (2003) are conducted in vivo in the tail tissue of\nthe mouse we do not know what is the dominant chemical that triggers the onset of the\nlymphatic prepatterning. It could be any combination of the matrix metalloproteases and\nprotons breaking down the cross-links between the fibres and the proton interaction with\nRoose and Fowler\nthe fibres themselves. Therefore, we are including the simplest \u201cillustrative\u201d term that\nshows a potential mechanism of lymphatic network development in this manuscript. Sec-\nondly, the inclusion of the counterion pressure term (and indeed any other energy term\nthat has been described in polymer gels) in the free energy does not actually change the\nmathematical detail of the analysis presented. Only the derivative of the free energy with\nrespect to \u03c6 and c at the steady state influences the linear stability and long wave analy-\nsis of the model presented below. Fundamentally, any mechanism that can contribute to\ngel swelling can also contribute to the patterning. However, we believe that the breaking\ndown of the cross-links between the collagen fibers is the dominant mechanism. Finally,\nwe feel that the inclusion of too many complicated free energy terms at this stage of the\nmodeling of the lymphatic network development will lead to a false sense of security\nabout the model. As pointed out above, there are several experimental issues that need\nto be addressed before the definitive model can be derived. In addition to this, we have\nnot been able to find an experimental study that rigorously parameterizes all these free\nenergy terms for collagen gels. Thus, for the purposes of transparency and simplicity,\nwe will only consider the Flory\u2013Huggins free energy terms as described above. We hope\nthat this paper will encourage the experimental community to perform experiments on 2D\ncollagen layers with varying either the matrix metallo protease concentrations or proton\nconcentration.\nThus, we take the overall free energy of the two phase collagen mixture to be given by\nF =\n\u222b\n\u03a9\n[\nf (\u03c6, c) + k\n2\n(\u2207\u03c6)2\n]\ndV, (11)\nwhere\nf = kBT\n\u03bd\n{\n(1 \u2212 \u03c6) ln(1 \u2212 \u03c6) + \u03c7\u03c6(1 \u2212 \u03c6) + 1\n2Nx\n(\n\u03c60 \u2212 \u03c6 \u2212 13\u03c6 ln\n\u03c60\n\u03c6\n)}\n. (12)\nIn order to derive the equations describing the movement of collagen, we will use the\nvariational principle that is used as standard in the polymer literature (Doi and Edwards,\n1986; Doi, 1983; Tomari and Doi, 1995). It relies on minimizing the rate of energy dissi-\npation, sometimes also called the Rayleighian. Development and more in depth discussion\non this method can be found in Doi and Edwards (1986), Doi (1983). A good brief histor-\nical overview of this method is given in Hillert and Agren (2006) where it is also pointed\nout that unlike minimization of the Hamiltonian, which is a physical principle, minimizing\nthe Rayleighian is more of a mathematical trick than a physical law.\nHence, after Doi and Onuki (1992), Hall et al. (2007), Milner (1993), Tanaka (1997),\nwe need to minimize the following functional with respect to vf and vp\nR = Ft +\n\u222b\n\u03a9\n{\n1\n2\n\u03be(vp \u2212 vf )2 \u2212 p\u2207 \u00b7 v \u2212 vp \u00b7 Fp \u2212 vf \u00b7 Ff\n}\ndV, (13)\nwhere \u03be is the drag coefficient between the fibres and the fluid. Thus, the term\n1\n2\u03be(vp \u2212 vf )2 represents the energy dissipation due to viscous forces in the two phase\nmixture. Fi are the forces acting on each of the components, and we have also intro-\nduced the pressure p to guarantee the incompressibility condition \u2207 \u00b7 v. The variable p\nis effectively a \u201cLagrange multiplier\u201d that ensures the incompressibility of the fibre-fluid\nmixture. Ft is the rate of change of free energy with time.\nNetwork Development in Biological Gels: Role in Lymphatic Vessel\nThe rate of change of free energy is derived by differentiating equation (11) with re-\nspect to time, i.e., we get\nFt =\n\u222b\n\u03a9\n[(\n\u2202f\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2212 k\u22072\u03c6\n)\n\u03c6t + \u2202f\n\u2202c\nct\n]\ndV + k\n\u222b\n\u2202\u03a9\n\u03c6t\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202n\ndS. (14)\nFrom now on, we will define the natural boundary condition (Courant and Hilbert, 2004)\noriginating from the correlation energy term to be\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202n\n= 0 on \u2202\u03a9, (15)\nwhere \u2202\n\u2202n\nis the derivative normal to the domain boundary \u2202\u03a9 , so that the second integral\nin (14) is zero.\nFrom Eqs. (1) and (4), we can write \u03c6t = \u2212\u2207 \u00b7 (\u03c6vp) and ct = \u2212\u2207 \u00b7 (c(1 \u2212 \u03c6)vf ) +\n\u2207 \u00b7 (D(\u03c6)\u2207c) and substituting this into Eq. (14), we get\nFt = \u2212\n\u222b\n\u03a9\n{(\n\u2202f\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2212 k\u22072\u03c6\n)\n\u2207 \u00b7 (\u03c6vp)\n+ \u2202f\n\u2202c\n[\u2207 \u00b7 (c(1 \u2212 \u03c6)vf\n) \u2212 \u2207 \u00b7 (D(\u03c6)\u2207c)]\n}\ndV\n=\n\u222b\n\u03a9\n{\n\u03c6\u2207\n(\n\u2202f\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2212 k\u22072\u03c6\n)\n\u00b7 vp + c(1 \u2212 \u03c6)\u2207 \u2202f\n\u2202c\n\u00b7 vf + \u2202f\n\u2202c\n\u2207 \u00b7 (D(\u03c6)\u2207c)\n}\ndV\n+\n\u222b\n\u2202\u03a9\n[(\n\u2202f\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2212 k\u22072\u03c6\n)\n\u03c6vp + \u2202f\n\u2202c\nc(1 \u2212 \u03c6)vf\n]\n\u00b7 dS. (16)\nAssuming that there is no flux of fluid or collagen through the boundary (we will as-\nsume this throughout this paper), i.e., vf and vp are zero on \u2202\u03a9 , we finally arrive at the\nfollowing equation for the rate of change of free energy\nFt =\n{\n\u03c6\u2207\n(\n\u2202f\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2212 k\u22072\u03c6\n)\n\u00b7 vp + c(1 \u2212 \u03c6)\u2207 \u2202f\n\u2202c\n\u00b7 vf + \u2202f\n\u2202c\n\u2207 \u00b7 (D(\u03c6)\u2207c)\n}\ndV . (17)\nThus, by minimizing Eq. (13) with Eq. (17) with respect to vp and vf , we get the\nfollowing equations for vp \u2212 vf and \u2207p\n\u2212\u03be(vp \u2212 vf ) \u2212 \u03c6\u2207\n(\n\u2202f\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2212 k\u22072\u03c6\n)\n+ \u03c6\u2207p + Fp = 0, (18)\n\u03be(vp \u2212 vf ) \u2212 c(1 \u2212 \u03c6)\u2207 \u2202f\n\u2202c\n+ (1 \u2212 \u03c6)\u2207p + Ff = 0. (19)\nFrom now on, we will assume that the forces Fi are zero, which essentially implies that\nwe are assuming that the shear movement of the gel is small and all bulk movements are\ndescribed by Flory mixing and elastic free energy terms in (11) and (12). We believe this\nto be realistic because there is no fluid or collagen flow across the implant and, therefore,\nthe shear effects are likely to be small.\nRoose and Fowler\nEquations (1), (18), and (19) need either one more equation to tie them together since\nthe Eqs. (18) and (19) are linearly dependent on the fluid and collagen velocity difference\nvp \u2212 vf . Alternatively, we would need to include higher order dissipative terms in Fp\nand Ff . There are several ways of doing this. We will use the approach taken by Bois-\nsonade (2003), Wolgemuth et al. (2002) and introduce the so-called \u201cbootstrap\u201d equation\nthat assumes that the phase averaged velocity is zero, i.e., we take everywhere\nv = \u03c6vp + (1 \u2212 \u03c6)vf = 0. (20)\nThe \u201cbootstrap expression\u201d given by Eq. (20) is clearly valid when there is no flux of\ncollagen or fluid through the boundaries. In this paper, we will limit ourselves to this case\nonly, but in future publications, we will address the case when there are sources\/sinks at\nthe boundary.\nThus, combining Eqs. (18)\u2013(20), we get\n\u03bevp = \u2212\u03c6(1 \u2212 \u03c6)2\n[\n(f\u03c6\u03c6 \u2212 cf\u03c6c)\u2207\u03c6 + (f\u03c6c \u2212 cfcc)\u2207c \u2212 k\u2207\u22072\u03c6\n]\n, (21)\n\u03bevf = \u03c62(1 \u2212 \u03c6)\n[\n(f\u03c6\u03c6 \u2212 cf\u03c6c)\u2207\u03c6 + (f\u03c6c \u2212 cfcc)\u2207c \u2212 k\u2207\u22072\u03c6\n]\n, (22)\nwhere f\u03c6\u03c6 = \u22022f\u2202\u03c62 , f\u03c6c = \u2202\n2f\n\u2202\u03c6\u2202c\n, fcc = \u22022f\u2202c2 .\nThe representative set of parameter values is shown in Table 1.\nSubstituting Eqs. (21) and (22) into conservation Eqs. (1) and (4), we get two cou-\npled equations for \u03c6 and c.

Secondly, in two dimensions in the rectangle, we will\nuse periodic boundary conditions in the y direction to reflect the fact that the sample\nis circular around the mouse tail. In the other, x direction, we use a zero flux of collagen\nboundary condition in addition to the natural boundary condition \u2202\u03c6\n\u2202n\n= 0, which originated\nfrom the correlation energy term in Eqs.

Thus, we begin by looking for\na solution to linearized equations (23) and (24) around the uniform steady state \u03c60 and c0\nin the form \u221d e\u03c3t+ik\u00b7x.

(c): Fastest growing modes in the case of infinite domain\n(solid line) and in the case of finite domain x = [0,1] (dashed line).\nThe shape of the dispersion relation is shown on Fig. 2a for different values of the\nparameter \u03b1 for fixed c0 = 0.1 and on Fig. 3a for different values of c0 with fixed \u03b1 = 250.\nFrom (29), we see that a spatial pattern forming instability can occur for wave numbers\n0 < k < kc = (1\/\u03ba)(c0f\u03c6c \u2212 f\u03c6\u03c6) provided that c0f\u03c6c \u2212 f\u03c6\u03c6 > 0 and that the second of\nthe stability conditions (29) is always satisfied. In this case, k = 0 and k = kc are neutrally\nstable. The fastest growing mode as a function of \u03b1 for a fixed c0 = 0.1 is shown on\nFig. 2c and as a function of c0 for a fixed value of \u03b1 = 250 is shown on Fig. 3c. The\nneutral stability curve is given2 by\nN(k; c0, \u03b1) =\n(\nd11 + \u03bak2\n)\nk4 = 0, (30)\nwhere\nd11 = f\u03c6\u03c6 \u2212 c0f\u03c6c = 11 \u2212 \u03c60 \u2212 2\u03c7 +\n1\n2\u03c60Nx0\n\u2212 \u03b1 c0\n2Nx0(1 \u2212 c0) .

The solutions for fixed \u03b1 and varying c0 as\na bifurcation parameter, for values that correspond to period one, two and three solutions,\nare virtually indistinguishable from these and we do not show them here.\nWe can see by comparing the numerical solutions shown on Fig. 4 with the analytic\npredictions of the fastest growing mode, shown on Fig. 2c that they agree very well.\nTherefore, we can conclude that the analytic estimate for the fastest growing mode that\nRoose and Fowler\nFig. 5 Maximum value of \u03c3 as a function of the bifurcation parameter c0. Corresponding values for\nmaximum k are shown on Fig. 3c.\nFig. 6 Results of numerical simulation for three different cases of bifurcation parameter c0 = 0.5,0.8,\nand 0.925, corresponding to period 1, 2, and 3, respectively, according to linear stability analysis. Results\nare shown at dimensionless time t = 2 which corresponds to dimensional time of about 6 days.\nwe found using linear stability theory is indeed consistent with numerics. On Fig. 5, we\nshow the dimensional values for the maximum growth rate as a function of the bifurcation\nvariable c0. In the experiments of Boardman and Swartz (2003), the patterns are seen to\nbe starting to be observed after about 10 days, which seems to agree with our estimates for\nthe maximum growth rate of order 0.1\u20130.01 day\u22121 for range c0 = 0.6\u20130.8. But, of course,\nwe need to stress here that because these experiments are conducted in vivo, there are\nother factors, such as lymphatic endothelial cells and epidermal cells migrating into the\nimplant, in play and the direct comparison with the experiments is not possible. Instead,\nwe can only say that our predicted timescales for patterning are not contradicted by the\nexperimental findings.\nOn Fig. 6, we show the two dimensional simulations for three different values of bifur-\ncation parameter c0 that according to linear stability analysis correspond to periods 1,2,\nand 3 patterns. As one can see the linear stability analysis is consistent with the numerical\nsimulations about the fastest growing point. We would also like to point out that period 3\nNetwork Development in Biological Gels: Role in Lymphatic Vessel\nsimulations are already starting to show geometric organization of pattern into a hexago-\nnal looking pattern (top left-hand side panel for case c0 = 0.925). We will present a more\ndetailed nonlinear analysis for hexagonal lattice solutions that takes into account higher\norder terms in expansion, together with more detailed two dimensional simulations in a\nseparate publication.\n4. Long wavelength reduction\nWe notice that at the bifurcation point c = ccrit , there is a double zero of a dispersion\nrelation at zero wave number. Therefore, a small amount above the bifurcation point the\nmodes that start growing are the ones with long wavelength. This suggests that we might\nbe able to find simplified equations using the long wavelength reduction (Kozyreff and\nTlidi, 2004). We do this by scaling space and time suitably and then expanding the state\nvariables as series in the small parameter. We will discuss the choice of the small parame-\nter, scalings, and expansion in detail now.\nThe natural small parameter to use in our current problem is \u03ba = 0.1, i.e., the parame-\nter that quantifies over which length scale we might expect sharp variations in collagen\nvolume fraction. Thus, we take \u03b5 = \u03ba = 0.1. The scalings suitable for time and space can\nbe deduced by considering the neutral stability curve near the bifurcation point, i.e.,\ndN\ndk\n= 6\u03b5k3\n(\n2d11\n3\u03b5\n+ k2\n)\n, (32)\nwhich suggest that if the bifurcation parameter is above the bifurcation point by the value\nthat makes d11 \u223c \u03b52, then to balance the terms in the brackets we need k \u223c \u221a\u03b5. With this\nchoice of scaling, the dispersion relation suggests that \u03c3 \u223c \u03b53 for all terms to balance.\nThese scalings derived from linear stability analysis for \u03c3 and k translate into scalings\nof time T = \u03b53t and space X = \u221a\u03b5x. This transforms our equations to\n\u03b52\u03c6T = \u2207 \u00b7\n{\n\u03c62(1 \u2212 \u03c6)2[\u03b52d\u221711\u2207\u03c6 + d12\u2207c \u2212 \u03b52\u2207\u22072\u03c6\n]}\n, (33)\n\u03b52cT = \u2207 \u00b7\n{\n\u2212c\u03c62(1 \u2212 \u03c6)2[\u03b52d\u221711\u2207\u03c6 + d12\u2207c \u2212 \u03b52\u2207\u22072\u03c6\n] + 1\nPe\nD\u2207c\n}\n, (34)\nwhere d11 = \u03b52d\u221711 (from now on we will drop \u2217).\nThe linear stability of Eq. (23) suggest the scalings to \u03c6 and c. Since the time derivative\nterm and derivatives of \u03c6 with the scalings presented above are O(\u03b53) and the derivatives\nin c are O(\u03b5), we expect that the perturbations in \u03c6 \u223c 1 and c \u223c \u03b52. Thus, we expand \u03c6\nand c in the following asymptotic series\n\u03c6(X, T ) = \u03c600(X, T ) + \u03b5\u03c61(X, T ) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (35)\nc(X, T ) = c00 + \u03b52c2(X, T ) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (36)\nWe are seeking for a solution to the Eqs. (33) and (34) in two dimensions on the\nrectangle with periodic boundary conditions in y direction and zero flux of polymer across\nthe boundaries in x direction. The boundary condition on c in the x direction reflects the\nRoose and Fowler\nfact that protons can permeate through from the edges of the sample and that this rate\nis proportional to the permeability \u03b2 . Thus, the boundary conditions in the x direction\nbecome\n\u03c6x = 0, d12cx \u2212 \u03b52\n(\u22072\u03c6)\nx\n= 0, 1\nPe\nDcx = \u03b2(c0 \u2212 c), (37)\nafter long wavelength scaling.\nUsing the expansions (35) and (36), we find that at O(1) c00 = c0 = constant every-\nwhere.\nAt order O(\u03b52), Eq.

Hence, the component normal to the boundary at x = 0\nand x = 1 of the left-hand side of (39) is zero and this means that in two dimensions x and\ny components of \u2207 \u00d7F are both zero and, therefore, we can write for our two dimensional\nproblem that\n\u2207c2 = c0\u03c6\n2\n00(1 \u2212 \u03c600)2\n1\nPeD(\u03c600) \u2212 c0\u03c6200(1 \u2212 \u03c600)2d12\n[\nd11\u2207\u03c600 \u2212 \u2207\u22072\u03c600\n]\n. (40)\nThus, the O(\u03b52) equation for \u03c600 is now given by (after dropping subindexes 00)\n\u03c6T = \u2207 \u00b7\n{\ng(\u03c6)\n[\nd11\u2207\u03c6 \u2212 \u2207\u22072\u03c6\n)}\n, (41)\nwhere\ng(\u03c6) = \u03c62(1 \u2212 \u03c6)2 D(\u03c6)\/Pe\nD(\u03c6)\/Pe \u2212 c0\u03c62(1 \u2212 \u03c6)2d12 , (42)\nd11 = f\u03c6\u03c6 \u2212 c0f\u03c6c, d12 = f\u03c6c \u2212 c0fcc, (43)\nare all evaluated at \u03c6. This equation is well behaved and regular only if g does not have\nany singularities. This highlights the fact that we need D(\u03c6)\/Pe \u2212 c0\u03c62(1 \u2212 \u03c6)2d12 > 0,\ni.e., the proton concentration is always moving from higher to lower and not vice versa. In\nNetwork Development in Biological Gels: Role in Lymphatic Vessel\nFig. 7 Profiles of f\u03c6 \u2212 c0fc in Eq. (45) for different values of c0.\nother words, we will not allow protons to accumulate due to collagen movement. Having\nsaid that, when Pe \t 1, as in our case, we can simplify the expression for g(\u03c6). We obtain\ng(\u03c6) \u2248 \u03c62(1 \u2212 \u03c6)2, (44)\nprovided Pec0\u03c62(1 \u2212 \u03c6)2d12 \t 1.\nThus, the long wavelength reduction results in a nonlinear Cahn\u2013Hilliard equation\nwith boundary conditions \u03c6x = 0 and (\u22072\u03c6)x = 0 at the boundaries in the x direction and\nperiodic in the y direction.\nWe could rewrite the Eqs. (41) in an alternative form\n\u03c6T = \u2207 \u00b7\n{\ng(\u03c6)\u2207[f\u03c6 \u2212 c0fc \u2212 \u22072\u03c6\n]}\n. (45)\nTranslating the equation back into the unscaled coordinates used in previous section,\nwe get the equation\n\u03c6t = \u2207 \u00b7\n{\ng(\u03c6)\u2207(h(\u03c6) \u2212 \r\u22072\u03c6)}, (46)\nwhere g(\u03c6) is given by Eq. (42), and h(\u03c6) is given by\nh(\u03c6) = \u22121 + (1 \u2212 2\u03c6)\u03c7 \u2212 log(1 \u2212 \u03c6) \u2212 1\n6Nx0\n(\n2 + log \u03c60\n\u03c6\n)\n+ \u03b1c0\n2Nx0(1 \u2212 c0)\n(\n\u03c60 \u2212 \u03c6 \u2212 13\u03c6 log\n\u03c60\n\u03c6\n)\n. (47)\nProfiles of h(\u03c6) are shown on Fig. 7.\nThe numerical solution computed using the reduced Eq. (41) is shown on Fig. 8\nAs we can see the pattern emerges over the dimensionless timescale of order t \u223c 15\nwhich translates into dimensional timescale of order 30 days. This finding is consis-\ntent with the experimental observations of Boardman and Swartz (2003). On the domain\nshown on Fig. 8, the linear stability analysis predicted that the fastest solution should be\nperiod 6 solution and this is indeed consistent with the numerical results.\nRoose and Fowler\nFig. 8 Solutions of Eq. (41) for parameter values c0 = 0.9, \u03b1 = 240, \u03c7 = 0.5, Nx,0 = 10, and \u03c60 = 0.03\nat different time points. Initial condition was taken to be a small random perturbation around the steady\nstate \u03c60.\n5. Discussion\nIn this paper, we have presented a model that for the first time, quantitatively describes\nthe factors that influence the first stage of lymphatic network formation within biogels.\nWe show that due to the fact that solutes, such as protons, can break down the cross-\nlinks between collagen fibres, therefore, decreasing the elastic constraining forces on the\ncollagen gel (i.e., Flory elastic energy), an initially homogeneous collagen gel is unstable\nto small spatial perturbations if the solute concentration is higher than a critical level\ndetermined by the linear stability analysis presented in Section 3.\nWe have also found that while the linear stability analysis predicts the wave number\nthat will grow fastest, it also predicts that the zero wave number is always neutrally sta-\nble and that the bifurcation from stable to unstable regime occurs there. This means that\nslightly above the bifurcation point the fastest growing mode has a long wavelength. This\ninspired us to use long wavelength reduction reminiscent of that used as standard in fluid\ndynamics and optics, and it enabled us to simplify coupled fourth order partial differential\nequations and derive a single equation for a collagen gel volume fraction that is very sim-\nilar to the Cahn\u2013Hilliard equation. We found using numerical simulations that the system\nappears to be moving toward a hexagonal looking pattern, which is very similar to the real\nlymphatic network that develops in experiments of Boardman and Swartz (2003). We will\npresent a nonlinear analysis of the stability and evolution of the hexagonal patterns in a\nsubsequent publication.\nOf course, in the end, lymphatics are not just patterns in the collagen gel, but are\nformed by lymphatic endothelial cells in cellular media. Our theory, therefore, helps to\nexplain the different cascade of events that would lead to it. We believe that collagen\narranges into a prepattern and then lymphatic endothelial cells migrate into the gel to make\nlymphatic vessels. This is realistic assuming that lymphatic endothelial cells have similar\nbehavior to vascular endothelial cells, i.e., that they migrate fastest at a finite, nonzero\ncollagen volume fraction (Zaman et al., 2005). There are no measurements similar to Wolf\net al. (2003), Zaman et al. (2005, 2006) that show that this would be true for lymphatic\nendothelial cells. However, it is intuitively clear that if it is true for endothelial cells and\ncancer cells then this could also be true for lymphatic endothelial cells. Thus, following\nthe prepatterning of the collagen gel, the lymphatic endothelial cells have to invade the\ngel in the fastest possible way to form the hexagonal looking lymphatic structures without\nneeding any extra complex cell signaling to tell them anything about the morphology.\nNetwork Development in Biological Gels: Role in Lymphatic Vessel\nAcknowledgements\nTR would like to acknowledge the support of the Royal Society by its award of the Univer-\nsity Research Fellowship and for the help received from Drs.
