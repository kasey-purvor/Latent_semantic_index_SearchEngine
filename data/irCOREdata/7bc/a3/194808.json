INTRODUCTION\nA class of very soft burst, very similar to gamma-ray bursts\n(GRBs), has been identified and is referred to as X-ray flashes\n(XRFs; Heise et al. 2001). Given the similarity of durations\namong XRFs, X-ray\u2013rich bursts, and GRBs (Heise et al. 2001;\nBarraud et al. 2003), the continuum of spectral properties ob-\nserved (Lamb, Donaghy, & Graziani 2003), from classic GRBs\nto X-ray\u2013rich bursts to XRFs and their cosmological origin\n(Bloom et al. 2003b; Soderberg et al. 2004), it seems probable\nthat XRFs and GRBs have very similar origins. XRFs have been\ndefined by a larger X-ray than gamma-ray fluence in the burst\n( ; Lamb et al. 2003); their distinguishing characteristicS \/S 1 1X g\nis a shift in the peak energy ( ) of the burst from GRBsEpeak\n(typically \u223c200 keV; Preece et al. 2000) to XRFs (\u000150 keV;\nPreece et al. 2000; Lamb et al. 2003). While GRBs and XRFs\nare located at cosmological distances, few have been located\nat redshifts less than 0.3. They are GRB 030329 at zp\n(associated with SN 2003dh; Hjorth et al. 2003; Stanek0.1685\net al. 2003), XRF 020903 with its probable host galaxy at\n(Soderberg et al. 2004), and GRB 980425, probablyzp 0.251\nassociated with SN 1998bw at (Galama et al.zp 0.0085\n1998). Of these, only the redshift for GRB 030329 was found\ndirectly from the afterglow, and it has characteristics that are\nstill a matter of some debate; XRF 020903 had a very low\npeak spectral energy and a low luminosity (Sakamoto et al.\n2004; Soderberg et al. 2004), and GRB 980425 had an ex-\n1 Niels Bohr Institute, Astronomical Observatory, University of Copenha-\ngen, Juliane-Maries Vej 30, DK-2100 Copenhagen \u00d8, Denmark; darach@\nastro.ku.dk, jens@astro.ku.dk, pallja@astro.ku.dk, kp@astro.ku.dk.\n2 X-Ray Astronomy Group, Department of Physics and Astronomy, Leices-\nter University, Leicester LE1 7RH, UK; anl@star.le.ac.uk, pto@star.le.ac.uk,\njulo@star.le.ac.uk, jat@star.le.ac.uk, sav2@star.le.ac.uk, mjw@star.le.ac.uk,\nrw@star.le.ac.uk.\n3 Laboratory for High Energy Astrophysics, Code 662, NASA Goddard\nSpace Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD 20771; jnr@milkyway.gsfc.nasa.gov.\n4 Universities Space Research Association.\ntraordinarily low luminosity (Kulkarni et al. 1998). On the basis\nof GRB 980425, it was suggested that a variety of GRBs with\nvery low luminosity, detectable at low redshift, form a distinct\nclass of objects from classical high-redshift GRBs (Kulkarni\net al. 1998). It has also been suggested that low luminosity in\na burst is related to a steeply declining afterglow (\u201cf-GRBs\u201d;\nBloom, Frail, & Kulkarni 2003c) or to low (Amati et al.Epeak\n2002; Barraud et al. 2003; Sakamoto et al. 2004).\nIn this Letter, we report on XMM-Newton observations of GRB\n031203,5 begun 6 hr after the burst, as well as a second, ser-\nendipitous observation made on 2003 December 6. During the\nfirst observation, an echo of the prompt emission, reflected off\ndust in our Galaxy, was detected as an expanding ring centered\non the afterglow. This was reported by Vaughan et al. (2004),\nand that remarkable detection (the first time that we are aware\nthat prompt X-rays have been detected at energies below 2 keV)\nhas allowed us to infer properties of the burst itself in soft X-\nrays; however, the dust echo is not directly considered here.\nA cosmology with , , andQ p 0.3 Q p 0.7 H p 75m L 0\nkm s\u00011 Mpc\u00011 is assumed throughout. Error ranges quoted are\n90% confidence intervals unless stated otherwise.\n2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION\nAn initial 56 ks exposure, centered on the error circle provided\nby the INTEGRAL burst-alert system (IBAS; Mereghetti et al.\n2003; Go\u00a8tz et al. 2003), was made with XMM-Newton\u2019s EPIC\ncameras. One X-ray source close to the center of the circle was\nobserved to fade (Rodriquez-Pascual et al. 2003). The astrometry\nof the field was corrected by matching X-ray sources to stars\nfrom the USNO-A2.0 catalog using the SAS task EPOSCORR\n(Tedds & Watson 2004). The position of the fading X-ray source,\nR.A.p 08h02m30s.190, decl.p\u000139\u000351\u000304\u0002.05 (J2000.0), with a\n5 We refer to this burst as GRB 031203 to avoid confusion, though we show\nit to be an XRF in \u00a7 5.\nL102 WATSON ET AL. Vol. 605\nFig. 1.\u2014X-ray light curve (based on the mean EPIC 0.2\u201310.0 keV absorbed\nfluxes) for the afterglow of GRB 031203 fitted with a single power-law model.\nThe 3 j limits of the fit are plotted on the main figure (dashed line), while\nthe best fit is shown on the inset. The temporal slope derived from the XMM-\nNewton observations is much too flat ( ) to fit the prompt flux\u00010.55\u0002 0.05\n(open circle) as derived from the observed dust echo. A slope \u0001\u00011.7 is\nrequired to connect the prompt emission with the afterglow flux. The late-time\nflux detected by Chandra (Fox et al. 2004) is shown for completeness and\nimplies a steepening in the light curve after about 3 days. [See the electronic\nedition of the Journal for a color version of this figure.]\n1 j error radius of 0\u0002.7 (Tedds et al. 2003), is consistent with the\nposition of a fading radio source (Frail 2003; Soderberg, Kul-\nkarni, & Frail 2003). A star-forming galaxy at redshift zp\n(Hsia et al. 2003; Bloom et al. 2003a; Prochaska et al.0.105\n2004) was also detected within 0\u0002.5 of this position at near-\ninfrared wavelengths. No other fading sources are detected with\nEPIC in the IBAS error circle. In light of this and the fact that\nthe dust echo of a very bright transient source is detected centered\non the fading source (Vaughan et al. 2004), the X-ray source at\nthis position must be the GRB afterglow.\nThe first XMM-Newton observation was carried out under\nlow background conditions (the background represents \u223c10%\nof the extracted counts), and the data were not filtered for this\nreason beyond standard processing. Spectral data from the sec-\nond observation were filtered because of high background in\nthe middle and end of the observation. The \u201cthin\u201d and \u201cme-\ndium\u201d filters were used in the first observation with the pn and\nMOS cameras, respectively. The \u201cthick\u201d filters were used with\neach camera during the second observation, in which the prin-\nciple target was z Puppis, and the afterglow was off-axis by\n\u223c8\u0003. Data from the EPIC-MOS and pn cameras are consistent\nwithin cross-calibration uncertainties. Because of the extreme\nlack of counts at low energies, most of the counts at energies\nbelow 0.8 keV are redistributed from higher energies; low-\nlevel uncertainty in this redistribution, usually negligible in\nspectra with only moderate soft absorption, has caused us to\nexclude data below 0.8 keV from the spectral analysis. The\ndata reduction followed a standard procedure similar to that out-\nlined in Watson et al. (2002b) except that the data were processed\nand reduced with the XMM-Newton SAS version 5.4.1. A spec-\ntral binning using a minimum of 20 counts bin\u00011 was used. Two\nregions on the detector were used to obtain different background\nspectra, avoiding obvious sources and the dust echo. No signif-\nicant difference was observed using either background region.\nTo calibrate the absolute fluxes for the light curves, the mean\nflux for the observation, derived from the best-fit model to the\njoint fit of the EPIC spectra, was used to scale the count-rate\nlight curves, using the response matrices and ancillary response\nvectors generated by the SAS tasks RMFGEN and ARFGEN,\nwhich take into account, among other things, the off-axis angle\nof the source and the filter used. Careful analysis of the flux\ncalibration required the use of ancillary response vectors newer\nthan those available in the current version of the SAS; though\nusually insignificant for on-axis sources, this does affect sources\nfar from the optical axis considerably (R. Saxton 2004, private\ncommunication). The first observation was divided into five\n11 ks segments to examine spectral evolution.\n3. RESULTS\nThe afterglow decays (Rodriquez-Pascual et al. 2003) during\nthe first observation (Fig. 1) and is well fitted ( for2x p 44.9\n54 degrees of freedom) by a power law with index \u00010.54\u0002\n, a decay slower than reported for any previous X-ray0.09\nafterglow except GRB 980425 (Pian et al. 2000).\nContinuing the power-law decay observed in the first ob-\nservation fits the second observation well ( for both2x p 46.6\ndata sets). The fit to both data sets, a power law with index\n, is not improved significantly by the addition of\u00010.55\u0002 0.05\na break to the single power-law model ( compared2x p 45.6\/56n\nto , F-test probabilityp 0.65).2x p 46.3\/58n\nWe (Vaughan et al. 2004) have discovered the first dust echo\nobserved from a GRB and, using it, have derived the 0.2\u201310.0\nkeV absorbed flux of the prompt emission [ \u00017(1.5\u0002 0.8)# 10\nergs cm\u00012 s\u00011]. The drop in flux to ergs cm\u00012 s\u00011\u0001135# 10\nobserved in the afterglow at the beginning of the XMM-Newton\nobservation requires a slope \u223c\u00011.7 and is not consistent with the\ndecay slope of the best-fitting power law. There must therefore\nhave been a discontinuous flux change of orders of magnitude\nbetween the prompt and afterglow phases in the soft X-ray band\n(a characteristic somewhat atypical of bursts observed by\nBeppoSAX; Frontera et al. 2000), or there was a faster decay rate\nin the afterglow phase than is usual in early X-ray afterglows\n(typical early X-ray afterglow slopes are \u223c\u00011 at day, e.g.,t \u0001 1\nButler et al. 2003; Tiengo et al. 2003; Watson et al. 2002a, 2003;\nMereghetti et al. 2003), which then slowed markedly in the af-\nterglow phase. This light curve is reminiscent of the optical light\ncurves of GRBs 990123 and 021211, where a rapid decline was\nobserved initially (\u00010.1 days), then a slower decay and finally a\nresteepening (Fruchter et al. 1999; Castro-Tirado et al. 1999; Li\net al. 2003).\nThe complete spectra of the afterglow from the first and\nsecond observations (Fig. 2) and the five 11 ks spectra from\nthe first observation can be fitted with a power law with ab-\nsorption in excess of the Galactic value ( cm\u00012;215.9# 10\nDickey & Lockman 1990).

The218.8# 10\nabsorption is consistently \u223c50% above the Galactic column den-\nsity, but this may be due to variations in the local column density\non scales \u00011\u0003 (Dickey & Lockman 1990).

Given the brightness ofA p 2.0I\nthe underlying galaxy ( mag; Bailyn et al. 2003), a sourceIp 19.1\nwith observed mag seems unlikely to be detected.I 1 21.9\nThe nondetection of the optical afterglow makes the asso-\nciation of the GRB with the star-forming galaxy at zp\nuncertain since we do not have a redshift associated with0.105\nthe afterglow. The X-ray observations strengthen this associ-\nation. The X-ray position is the best localization available and\nplaces the GRB within \u223c1 kpc of the center of the galaxy; the\nprobability (based on the I-band galaxy counts of Postman et\nal. 1998 and neglecting gravitational lensing and extragalactic\nabsorption) of the center of a galaxy at least this bright ap-\npearing coincident with the XMM-Newton position by chance\nis low, \u223c . The probability of the center of any galaxy\u000157# 10\nbeing detected (assuming a limiting I-band magnitude of 23)\nwithin 0\u0002.7 radius is only 0.004.\nAt a luminosity distance of 453 Mpc, GRB 031203 is the\nclosest GRB\/XRF with known redshift after GRB 980425. This\ndistance implies that the gamma-ray burst energy and afterglow\nluminosity were very low compared to cosmological GRBs\n(Soderberg et al. 2003).\nMereghetti & Go\u00a8tz (2003) quote a peak 20\u2013200 keV photon\nflux for GRB 031203 of 1.2 cm\u00012 s\u00011 and a duration of \u223c30 s.\nFor the following calculations we use an estimate of the mean\nflux of one-third the peak flux (Hakkila et al. 2000) to derive a\nphoton fluence of 12 cm\u00012. We also use a power-law index\nfor the burst, justified below (\u00a7 5).Gp 2.5\u0002 0.3\nThe equivalent isotropic gamma-ray energy (20\u20132000 keV\nrest frame) is only ergs, well below the total gamma-493# 10\nray energy in the general case (\u223c1051 ergs; Bloom et al. 2003c)\nbut a few times greater than XRF 020903 (Sakamoto et al. 2004)\nand \u223c30 times that of GRB 980425 (Pian et al. 2000). The peak\nradio luminosity is often used as a surrogate for the total burst\nenergy; GRB 031203\u2019s radio luminosity after 4 days (Frail 2003)\nis very low but within a factor of 3 of GRB 980425\/SN 1998bw\nat the same time (Kulkarni et al. 1998; Soderberg et al. 2004),\nindicating that it may have an unusually low peak radio lumi-\nnosity. The X-ray luminosity for GRB 031203 is also low (Sod-\nerberg et al. 2003). Even the isotropic equivalent luminosity\nbased on the observed 2\u201310 keV flux is ergs s\u00011 at429# 10\n10 hr, more than 3 orders of magnitude below the typical value\n(\u223c ergs s\u00011; Berger, Kulkarni, & Frail 2003), though a465# 10\nfactor of \u223c100 above GRB 980425 (Pian et al. 2000).\n5. GRB 031203 AS AN XRF\nThe photon power-law index from the 0.2\u201310.0 keV photon\nfluence (estimated from the dust echo) to the 20\u2013200 keV photon\nfluence is . Furthermore, a power-law fit to theGp 2.5\u0002 0.3\ndust echo, corrected for the effects of the dust scattering, yields\nan intrinsic . A single power law (with )Gp 2.2\u0002 0.3 G \u0004 2\nfrom 1 to 200 keV is consistent with these numbers: in this case\nthe of the burst must be below 1 keV, a remarkably lowEpeak\neven for an XRF. They are also consistent with a power-Epeak\nlaw index that steepens between the soft (0.2\u201310.0 keV) and hard\n(20\u2013200 keV) X-ray bands, with probably below the 20\u2013Epeak\n200 keV band. It is likely that the of GRB 031203 was \u000120Epeak\nkeV. Dar (2003) predicted for this burst close to 20 keVEpeak\nbased on the cannon ball model; we cannot exclude this possibility.\nIn any case, GRB 031203 is an XRF; the ratio used to define\nXRFs, , is in this case, anlog (S \/S ) 1 0 0.6\u0002 0.3X g2\u000130 keV 30\u0001400 keV\nextreme value (compare XRF 020903 with a ratio of 0.7; Sakamoto\net al. 2004), assuming a single power law in the 2\u2013400 keV band.\nWe assume above that the fluence observed in the X-ray halo\nis due entirely to the burst event. Some fraction will, of course,\nbe contributed by the afterglow, since the time of the observed\nX-ray fluence is only constrained to \u223c1 hr of the burst. To\nquantify this, we derive the maximum afterglow contribution\nto the fluence (where the afterglow flux starts at the mean burst\nflux and decays without a break to the flux observed at the\nstart of the XMM-Newton observations). This depends on the\nmean flux of the burst and therefore on the burst duration. The\nafterglow contributes less than 60% of the total fluence when\nthe burst duration is 30 s. Even at 60%, GRB 031203 is still\nan XRF, with within the uncertainty mentionedlog (S \/S ) \u223c 0.3X g\nabove. The contribution of the afterglow to the observed soft X-\nray fluence cannot influence the classification of GRB 031203\nas an XRF. In order for GRB 031203 not to be an XRF, a very\nlarge fraction of the fluence would have to be significantly earlier\nor later than the hard X-ray burst and (somewhat arbitrarily)\nrenamed a \u201cprecursor\u201d or a \u201crebrightening,\u201d with a total energy\ncomparable to the burst itself.\nINTEGRAL\u2019s SPI-ACS detected GRB 031203; the count rate\nis not inconsistent with that expected from the fluence and spectral\nslope mentioned above (von Kienlin et al. 2003). If the ratio of\npeak count rate to mean count rate (Prochaska et al. 2004) in the\nIBIS band (20\u2013200 keV) is the same as in the SPI-ACS band\n(1100 keV), then the total 20\u2013200 keV fluence estimated above\nwill be smaller by a factor of 3.2, making GRB 031203 the most\nextreme XRF ever observed, with . Anlog (S \/S ) \u223c 1X g2\u000130 keV 30\u0001400 keV\nanalysis of all the INTEGRAL data will be interesting since the\nquoted peak flux for the burst ( ergs cm\u00012 s\u00011 in the\u000171.3# 10\n20\u2013200 keV band) implies a much harder spectrum during the\npeak ( ), indicating strong spectral evolution. This has noG \u223c 1.3\nimpact on our calculations above since they are based on the total\nfluences in the burst, derived from the count rates only, not the\npeak flux. A tantalizing result we can compute is an approximate\nL104 WATSON ET AL. Vol. 605\nupper limit on the pseudo-z ( ; Atteia 2003) using keV,z\u02c6 E ! 20peak\n, and s, for which we find .\u02c6G 1 1.9 t p 30 z \u0001 0.1590\n6. DISCUSSION\nAmati et al. (2002) have found a relation between the equivalent\nisotropic gamma-ray total energy ( ) and in GRBs. ThoughE Eiso peak\nonly a single burst, the low-luminosity XRF 020903 has extended\nthis relation to very low luminosities and peak energies (Sakamoto\net al. 2004). Using the best-fit values for this relation quoted by\nSakamoto et al. (2004) and the equivalent isotropic luminosity in\nthe 1 keV\u201310 MeV band derived here ( ergs), the501.5# 10\nof GRB 031203 should lie close to\u223c10 keV; this is consistentEpeak\nwith the suggested above and further confirms the correlationEpeak\nbetween peak energies and .Eiso\nOne implication of this correlation is clear; XRFs have low\nas we see here. Furthermore, if the total energy in gamma-Eiso\nrays is nearly constant at \u223c1051 ergs (Frail et al. 2001; Bloom et\nal. 2003c), it implies that the opening angle in XRFs is extremely\nwide. However, this becomes problematic if there is a significant\npopulation of XRFs with peak energies below \u223c20 keV, since the\nAmati et al. (2002) relation implies that for these bursts isEiso\nless than the total energy in gamma rays inferred by Frail et al.\n(2001). Only one XRF so far had clearly indicated this paradox\u2014\nXRF 020903, mentioned above. But now GRB 031203 similarly\nshows a very low . (We note that it has been suggested thatEiso\nXRF 030723 also has a very low [Lamb et al. 2004], but theEiso\nredshift in that case is highly uncertain; Fynbo et al. 2004.) These\nresults hint that a significant population of (so far, rare) low-\nluminosity bursts may indeed exist as required in some models\nof off-axis GRBs (e.g., Yamazaki et al. 2004).\nIt has been suggested (Bloom et al. 2003c) that a class of\nunderluminous GRBs exist with fast decay rates (f-GRBs) at early\ntimes ( days). We cannot exclude GRB 031203 from sucht \u0001 0.5\na class. Both its luminosity and its decay rates are extraordinary;\nthe luminosity is very low and the decay rate unusually slow, but\nthere must be a fast decay in the afterglow before the XMM-Newton\nobservation at less than 0.25 days, if the prompt and afterglow\nfluxes decay smoothly and there is no abrupt drop in the flux\nbetween prompt and afterglow phases. GRB 980425, possibly\nsimilar in terms of its low luminosity, is also interesting as a\ncomparison object in terms of its X-ray decay structure. GRB\n980425 also showed a fast decay from the prompt X-ray flux\n(power-law index, ) and a very slow decay in X-raysa \u223c \u00011.5\nfrom 1 to 100 days ( ). In XRF 030723 a very slow decaya \u223c \u00010.2\nwas observed at optical wavelengths at early times (Fynbo et al.\n2004): perhaps very slow early decay rates are related to the\napparent luminosity and of the burst, lending some supportEpeak\nto the idea that these bursts may be viewed off-axis (Granot et al.\n2002; Yamazaki et al. 2004).\nWe thank R.
