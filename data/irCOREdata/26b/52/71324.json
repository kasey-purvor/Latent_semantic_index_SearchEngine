Early motherhood,\nnon-cohabitation, and lone motherhood increased the odds of smoking; early motherhood and non-\ncohabitation reduced the odds of former smoking. For example, relative to childless women, odds ratios\n(OR) for women who had become mothers ,20 years were 1.71 for smoking and 0.76 for former\nsmoking. The effects of education and current SEP remained strong with the inclusion of childbearing and\ncohabitation variables for both outcomes. For instance, compared with women in education to age >22,\nthe odds ratio for smoking for those leaving school (16 was 3.37 and for former smoking was 0.42.\nConclusions: Both the conventionally measured socioeconomic lifecourse and the domestic lifecourse\ncontributed separately to the odds of smoking and former smoking, suggesting that lifecourse analyses\nshould incorporate women\u2019s domestic circumstances as an important pathway of influence on their\nsmoking status in early adulthood.\nI\nncreasing evidence that the socioeconomic environment in\nboth childhood and adulthood influences adult health is\nstarting to stimulate research on how social disadvantage\ntakes its toll across the course of people\u2019s lives.1 2 This\nresearch has been characterised by, firstly, a reliance on a\ncomparatively narrow conceptualisation of the socioeconomic\nlifecourse and, secondly, its application to a comparatively\nnarrow range of health related outcomes.\nConceptually, the socioeconomic lifecourse is represented as a\nperson\u2019s journey from the socioeconomic environment of the\nnatal family (typically indexed by father\u2019s occupation), through\nthe education system (years\/level of education) to adulthood\n(own occupation). This trajectory captures important determi-\nnants of life chances and living standards in rich industrialised\nsocieties, and ones with powerful effects on disease and\nmortality risk in adulthood.3 4 But defining the socioeconomic\nlifecourse through a person\u2019s relationship to the formal\ninstitutions of the labour market and the education system\nobscures their position in the informal institutions of home and\nfamily, positions that are integral to women\u2019s socioeconomic\nlifecourse. Thus, single women are more likely to live in lower\nincome households than single men, and entry into and exit\nfrom marriage have greater effects on women\u2019s employment\npatterns, earnings, and household incomes.5 6 Parenthood has\nhigher economic opportunity costs for women, reducing\nemployment rates and lifetime earnings.7 Lone mothers face\nadditional economic penalties, with poverty rates well above the\nmean across rich industrialised countries.8 9 As such patterns\nsuggest, a woman\u2019s partnership and parenthood trajectories are\ninseparable from the conventionally defined lifecourse. Thus\npoor childhood circumstances and low educational attainment\nanticipate early entry into motherhood,10 11 a pathway to\nadulthood that in turn increases the risk of lone parenthood\nand future socioeconomic disadvantage.11 12\nThe primary application of the lifecourse perspective has\nbeen to physiological markers of health risk, morbidity, and\nmortality.3 4 13 But the concept is also important for under-\nstanding health related behaviours like cigarette smoking,\nwhich tracks across the lifecourse,14\u201316 increasingly displays\nsocioeconomic gradients,17\u201320 and makes an important con-\ntribution to socioeconomic health inequalities.21 22\nThere is evidence that current socioeconomic position\n(SEP) has a powerful effect on smoking status after\nadjustment for childhood circumstances.14 23\u201325 Childhood\neffects have also been found, both for smoking23 25 and\nquitting,14 25 and more strongly for women than men,23 25 with\neducation mediating the association between childhood SEP\nand adult smoking status.14 24 26 While smoking status is\nrelated to social mobility, with the upwardly mobile less\nlikely to smoke than those they leave behind, the overall\neffects of social mobility on smoking status are modest.15 16\nWomen\u2019s domestic trajectories and circumstances are\nrarely included in these socioeconomic lifecourse analyses.\nHowever, there is evidence that living with a partner reduces\na woman\u2019s odds of smoking, after adjustment for childhood\ncircumstances, education, and current SEP,24 that both poor\nchildhood circumstances and early motherhood contribute\nseparately to the risk of adult smoking,12 26 and that lone\nparenthood and economic hardship have separate effects on\nthe odds of smoking.27 28 In an analysis that included\nmeasures of the conventional socioeconomic lifecourse and\nwomen\u2019s domestic trajectories, age at entry into motherhood\nand being a single parent at age 33 increased the odds of\npersistent smoking across adulthood.26\nBuilding on these studies, we include childbearing\nhistories and cohabitation status in an analysis of the\nsocioeconomic predictors of women\u2019s smoking status in early\nadulthood.\n228\nwww.jech.com\n on 1 April 2008 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \nMETHODS\nSample\nThe study is based on the Southampton Women\u2019s Survey\n(SWS) of 12 484 women aged 20\u201334 years who were not\ncurrently pregnant, resident in the city of Southampton,\nsouthern England. It was approved by the Southampton and\nSouth West Hampshire local research ethics committee.\nParticipants were recruited from 1998 to 2002 via patient\nlists of general practices.29 30 Of those approached, 75% agreed\nto take part. The final sample is representative of the study\npopulation and has a deprivation and ethnic profile in line\nwith that of England and Wales. To include both educational\nand childbearing trajectories in the transition to adulthood,\nour analyses are restricted to women aged 25 to 34. Women\nwho had never had a paid job and whose occupation could\ntherefore not be coded (8% in the target age group) were\nexcluded, leaving a sample of 8437 for analysis.\nMeasures\nAll data were self reported. Current smokers were defined as\nthose who smoked >1 cigarette per day; former smokers had\nsmoked >1 cigarette per day for at least a year but were not\ncurrent smokers at the time of the interview.\nTable 1 lists socioeconomic lifecourse measures. Childhood\nSEP (based on father\u2019s occupation at birth) and current SEP\n(own full time current\/last occupation, or part time occupa-\ntion if never worked full time) were classified using the\nNational Statistics-Socioeconomic Classification (NS-SEC)\nthat, by categorising occupations according to their employ-\nment relations and conditions, provides an equivalent\nschema for male and female occupations.31 The simplified\nclassification was used (see table 1). For childhood SEP,\nwomen not reporting father\u2019s occupation (14%) were\nincluded as a separate category. Own SEP was coded by\ncurrent\/last full time occupation (or part time if never worked\nfull time). Seventy seven per cent were currently in full or\npart time employment; others, such as full time students and\nhousewives out of the labour market who had previously\nworked, were coded by their last occupation.\nEducational and childbearing trajectories were measured,\nrespectively, by age of leaving full time education and by\nwhether, and at what age, the woman had become a mother.\nMaternal status was derived from household information,\nand excludes children who had died or who were resident\nelsewhere. Cohabitation status was defined as living\/not\nliving with a partner. Age was included in the analyses as a\ncontinuous measure.\nData analysis\nIn initial analyses, logistic regression was used to predict\ncurrent smoking and former smoking separately for each\nlifecourse factor. In mutually adjusted models that included\nage and childhood SEP, we examined the effects on smoking\nbehaviour of the domestic lifecourse (childbearing histories\nand cohabitation status) before widening the model to\ninclude education and adult SEP. We show the statistical\nsignificance of removing each variable from this final model\nusing the likelihood ratio test. Potential interactions between\nchildhood SEP and subsequent lifecourse factors were also\ninvestigated.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 describes the socioeconomic and smoking profile of\nthe sample. Smoking prevalence (29%) was lower and quit\nrates (36%) were higher than national rates for women aged\n25\u201334 in 2000 (32% and 29% respectively).18 These rate\ndifferences were in line with regional variations in smoking\nTable 1 Socioeconomic and smoking profile of the sample\nNumber of cases % Of sample\nFather\u2019s collapsed NS-SEC\u0001\nProfessional and Managerial 2084 24.7\nIntermediate 2582 30.6\nSemi-routine\/routine 2579 30.6\nMissing 1192 14.1\nWoman\u2019s collapsed NS-SEC\u0001\nProfessional and Managerial 3254 38.6\nIntermediate 2850 33.8\nSemi-routine\/routine 2333 27.7\nAge of leaving full time education\n22 and over 1218 14.4\n19\u201321 1123 13.3\n17\u201318 2330 27.6\n16 and under 3766 44.6\nAge of entry into motherhood\nNo births at time of interview 3696 43.8\n25 and over 2178 25.8\n22\u201324 1085 12.9\n20 and 21 690 8.2\n,20 788 9.3\nLone motherhood\nNo 7623 90.4\nYes 814 9.6\nCohabitation status\nLives with partner 6106 72.4\nDoes not live with a partner 2331 27.6\nCurrent smoker\nNo 5959 70.6\nYes 2478 29.4\n% Of ever smoked\nFormer smoker\nNo 2478 64.0\nYes 1395 36.0\nTotal who ever smoked 3873 100.0\nNS-SEC, National Statistics-Socioeconomic Classification.\nSocioeconomic lifecourse influences on women\u2019s smoking status 229\nwww.jech.com\n on 1 April 2008 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \nstatus in England, with prevalence in the south east lower\nthan both northern regions and the country as a whole.18\nSmoking behaviour was socially patterned. Across both\nconventional and domestic lifecourse indicators, women on\ndisadvantaged social trajectories had higher rates and\nunadjusted odds of current smoking, and had lower rates\nand odds of cessation (tables 2 and 3, columns A and B).\nThe initial mutually adjusted model, including only age\nand childhood SEP, showed that women from professional\/\nmanagerial backgrounds have a lower odds of smoking and\nhigher odds of quitting than other groups (tables 2 and 3,\ncolumn C). When the model was extended to include the\ndomestic lifecourse (column D), age of motherhood, cohabi-\ntation status, and lone motherhood contributed separately to\nthe prediction of current smoking, and age of motherhood\nand cohabitation status to the odds of quitting. Compared\nwith women who were not mothers, the odds of smoking\namong women whose first child was born at age ( 21 were\nconsiderably higher; their odds of quitting were appreciably\nreduced. Women entering motherhood at >25 years had\nlower odds of smoking and higher odds of quitting than the\nreference group of non-mothers.\nIn the final model (tables 2 and 3, column E), domestic\nfactors continued to influence the odds of both outcomes.\nWhile attenuated, strong effects for age of motherhood\nremain. For current smoking, odds were higher for those who\nhad become mothers in their late teens and early 20s, relative\nboth to women who were still childless and to those who\nwere mothers at age 25 and over. Odds rose as age of\nmotherhood fell (OR 1.71, CI 1.41, 2.08, for first birth at ,20\nyears). Living without a partner (OR 1.22, CI 1.05, 1.42) and,\nover and above this, being a lone mother (OR 1.93, CI 1.54,\n2.42) added further to the odds of smoking. The odds\ndeclined with age.\nFor quitting, odds were lower for women who became a\nmother before age 20 than for the reference group of women\nwho were still childless. But odds were at their highest\namong women who entered motherhood at or after the age of\n25 (OR 1.64, CI 1.33,2.02). Partnership status also contrib-\nuted separately to the prediction of quitting, with odds\nconsiderably lower (OR 0.64, CI 0.51,0.80) for non-cohabiting\nwomen. Being a lone mother had no additional effect over\nand above age of motherhood and partnership status. The\nodds of quitting increased with age.\nIn this final model, education and adult SEP contributed\nseparately to the odds of both outcomes. The odds of smoking\nfor women who left full time education at the minimum age\nare over three times higher (OR 3.37, CI 2.75, 4.13) than for\nthose staying beyond age 21; their odds of quitting were more\nthan halved (OR 0.42, CI 0.32, 0.54).\nBecause our measure of childhood and adult SEP includes\na wide range of occupations within its three categories, we\nrepeated the modelling process using the registrar general\u2019s\nsocial class classification (social class I\/II, III non-manual, III\nmanual, IV\/V) in place of NS-SEC. The odds ratios for the\nother variables were unchanged, with pronounced effects of\neducation and the domestic lifecourse remaining (results not\ngiven). We also repeated the analysis, entering childhood\nSEP, education and current SEP together first and then\nadding the three domestic lifecourse measures. The effects of\nthe conventional lifecourse measures were little attenuated\nby the inclusion of the domestic lifecourse measures (results\nnot given).\nTesting for interactions in model E, childhood circum-\nstances were found to modify the effect of lone motherhood\non current smoking. The effect of lone motherhood was\ngreater for women from professional and managerial back-\ngrounds (OR 2.51, CI 1.63,3.89) than for women whose\nTable 2 Current smoking: prevalence rates, unadjusted and mutually adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals)\n(n = 8437).

Conventionally measured by\nchildhood SEP, education, and adult SEP, the concept can\nobscure factors known to have a stronger effect on life\nchances and living standards of women than men, including\npartnership and parenting trajectories. As a rich seam of\nsociological research has shown, women\u2019s socioeconomic\ntrajectories are fashioned by both gender and socioeconomic\ninequality, with investment in early motherhood central to\nthe identities of young women negotiating a pathway to\nadulthood against a backdrop of material and social\ndisadvantage.32 33 As such research suggests, the socioeco-\nnomic lifecourse is gendered. Conventional indicators may\ntherefore be detecting only some of its influences on health\nbehaviours that, like cigarette smoking, track from adoles-\ncence into adulthood.14 26 34 35\nThere are few prospective studies capable of identifying the\ntemporal relations between women\u2019s socioeconomic trajec-\ntories and their smoking careers. Most of the birth cohort\nstudies relate to men and to older cohorts growing up in a\ntime of greater stability in domestic trajectories.3 4 Analyses\nbased on such studies may therefore underestimate the effect\nof early motherhood and lone motherhood on the smoking\ncareers of young women today. This contemporary study was\nbased in the UK, where, as in other rich societies, transitions\nTable 3 Quitting smoking: prevalence rates, unadjusted and mutually adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals)\n(n = 3873).

Validation studies show that both measures are\nbroadly reliable,38 39 with no systematic socioeconomic biases\nin underreporting of smoking.40 41\nIn line with other studies in rich societies, we found that\nsmoking risk was strongly patterned by social background,\neducational pathways, and current occupational status.15 23\u201325\nConsistent with their findings, education and, to a lesser\ndegree, current SEP were predictive of quitting.42 43 Our\nlimited measures of childhood and adult SEP may have\nresulted in an overestimation of the effects of education, with\neducation capturing dimensions of both family background\nand current circumstances. However, other studies have\nsimilarly noted the importance of educational trajectories in\nshaping smoking careers.14 24 42 44\nOur study adds to these findings by highlighting the\nassociation between women\u2019s domestic circumstances and\nsmoking status in early adulthood, with effects that remain\nafter adjustment for conventional measures of the socio-\neconomic lifecourse. Women following disadvantaged trajec-\ntories into early and lone motherhood had higher odds of\nsmoking than those who deferred childbearing and parented\nwithin a cohabiting relationship; among the ever-smokers,\nearly motherhood and non-cohabitation reduced the odds of\nquitting. Reliance on own occupation to measure adult SEP\nmay underestimate its contribution relative to domestic\nlifecourse factors, with the latter potentially capturing the\neffects of partner\u2019s socioeconomic position on women\u2019s living\nstandards and life chances. However, substituting household\nmeasures of SEP (social housing and receipt of means tested\nbenefits) for own NS-SEC left the effects of both the\nconventional and the domestic lifecourse factors on the odds\nof current smoking and quitting largely unchanged.\nElsewhere, early motherhood has been found to increase\nthe odds of adult smoking, over and above the effects of poor\nchildhood circumstances12 26 and lone parenthood to both\nincrease the odds of smoking27 28 and to reduce the odds of\nquitting.27 43\nThe lowest odds of smoking and the highest odds of\nquitting were among women who had their first child at age\n>25: they were less likely to smoke and more likely to have\nquit than both younger mothers and women who were not\nmothers at the time of interview. While rates of post-partum\nresumption are high, pregnancy has a long term cessation\neffect,42 an effect that is more pronounced for first time\nmothers.45 46 Consistent with these patterns, women who\nwere mothers by their mid-20s were more likely to be former\nsmokers and less likely to be smokers than non-mothers.\nWhile our study points to the importance of the domestic\nlifecourse for women\u2019s smoking status in early adulthood, its\ncross sectional design means that findings are suggestive not\nconclusive. Further caveats need to be made. Firstly, father\u2019s\noccupation was not recorded for 14% of the sample, a group\nwith higher adjusted odds of smoking than women from\nsemi-routine and routine backgrounds. Compared with\nwomen from these backgrounds, women with missing\ninformation on childhood SEP were more likely to have\nstayed in education beyond 16 (50% v 42%) and to be in a\nprofessional\/managerial occupation (34% v 28%). But they\nwere more likely to have lost contact with their fathers (21% v\n1%) and to be adopted (8% v 0.3%). As this suggests, the\n\u2018\u2018missing data\u2019\u2019 category may be measuring dimensions of\npsychosocial disadvantage not captured by father\u2019s NS-SEC.\nWhen analyses were redone to exclude this group, the odds\nratios for all predictors were little changed for either smoking\noutcome, and childhood SEP remained a significant predictor\nof current smoking at the 5% level. None the less,\ninformation on father\u2019s occupation would have enabled the\ngroup to be classified within the NS-SEC schema, with a\npotentially larger effect on the predictors.\nSecondly, our measure of parenthood trajectories, derived\nfrom a sample of women at various points in their\nreproductive careers, combined being a mother with age at\nfirst birth. Other datasets suggest that, for women ,25 years,\nage at first birth is strongly associated with past and future\nsocioeconomic circumstances and with adult smoking sta-\ntus.12 47 At ages>25, women are less socially differentiated by\nage at first birth; in consequence, the measure adds little\nexplanatory power to lifecourse models for older women.12 47\nAs a further check, we repeated the analyses for the\nsubsample of women who were already mothers\n(n = 4741). With lone motherhood included, cohabitation\nstatus was redundant. The lifecourse predictors, and their\nrelative contribution to the prediction of current smoking and\nquitting, were unchanged.\nThirdly, there is some evidence that adolescent smoking\nstatus influences subsequent social mobility,48 effects that are\nhard to detect in cross sectional surveys. A limited check of\nthe effects of a change in NS-SEC between childhood and\nadulthood on the odds of smoking was undertaken. Such a\nchange was found to have no extra effect over and above\nthose of childhood and adult SEP.\nFinally, the study is located in a society where the\neconomic opportunity cost of caring for children is higher\nthan elsewhere.49 In separate analyses of the SWS, we\nexamined the contribution of women\u2019s domestic and socio-\neconomic trajectories to their current SEP. While strong\neffects of childhood circumstances and education were seen,\nboth parenthood histories and partnership status emerged as\npowerful predictors. As this suggests, it would be important\nto repeat the analysis in societies where the socioeconomic\nimpact of women\u2019s reproductive trajectories is less pro-\nnounced, to build a cross-national perspective on the effects\nof childbearing and cohabitation status on women\u2019s smoking\nstatus in early adulthood.\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur study builds on evidence that domestic trajectories and\ncircumstances capture exposures that have yet to be\nincorporated into the concept of the socioeconomic lifecourse.\nConsistent with other studies, it shows that women\u2019s\ndomestic circumstances may represent an important pathway\nof influence on their smoking status, operating over and\nabove the effects of the childhood SEP-education-adult SEP\ntrajectory.\nTwo broad conclusions can be drawn. Firstly, it suggests\nthat lifecourse analyses should be widened to include\npathways into social and health disadvantage beyond those\nindexed by conventional measures of SEP. Our focus on\ngendered socioeconomic pathways is one part of this larger\ntask of elucidating the processes that shape health risk over\nthe lifecourse in rich, but increasingly diverse, dynamic, and\npolarised, societies.\nSecondly, our study adds to evidence that public health\npolicies should be widened beyond their traditional focus on\nchanging individual behaviour, to moderating the unequal\nlifecourse pathways in which smoking careers are\nembedded.50 51 This broader vision of tobacco control policy\nwould include evaluation of policies that influence children\u2019s\nexposure to disadvantage, the life chances of young people\nheading for early school leaving and early parenthood, and\nthe social and material circumstances of women, particularly\nlone mothers, whose employment opportunities are restricted\nto the low waged sectors of the labour market.\n232 Graham, Francis, Inskip, et al\nwww.jech.com\n on 1 April 2008 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe thank the women who took part in the Southampton Women\u2019s\nSurvey and the survey staff who recruited the women and collected\nand processed the data.
