Unlocking the time-capsule of historic aerial photography \n \nKEYWORDS: Antarctic Peninsula, block adjustment, calibration, \nDigital Elevation Model, historic aerial photography, ice volume change \nINTRODUCTION \nThe Antarctic Peninsula north of 70\u00b0S covers less than 0.8% of the area of \nthe entire grounded ice sheet in Antarctica, but receives about 8% of its snowfall \n(van Lipzig, et al., 2004).  The amount of ice in the region is not accurately \nknown, but a conservative estimate is that it contains enough ice to raise global \nsea level by 5-10 cm.  Recent investigations have demonstrated clear evidence that \nthe ice sheet of the Antarctic Peninsula is being affected by contemporary climatic \nchange, with warming of mean annual temperatures of more than 2.5 \u00b0C since the \n1950s \u2013 a rate unprecedented over the last two millennia and amongst the \nstrongest in the southern hemisphere (King, 2003; Vaughan, et al., 2003). In \naddition, the number of days per year on which melting of ice can occur has \nincreased by up to 74% since 1950 (Vaughan, 2006). \nResearch using existing aerial photographs and satellite images has shown \nmany cryospheric responses to the climate changes: Ice shelves on both the east \nand west coasts have suffered progressive retreat and then abrupt collapse (Morris \nand Vaughan, 2003; Scambos, et al., 2000); the glaciers that supply those ice \nshelves with ice have accelerated (Rignot, et al., 2004; Rignot, et al., 2005; Rott, \net al., 1996; Scambos, et al., 2004); 87% of glaciers that reach the sea (rather than \nan ice-shelf) have retreated over the last 40 years (Cook, et al., 2005) and the flow \nrate of these glaciers has increased by about 12% over the last 12 years (Pritchard \nand Vaughan, Submitted). Taken together, these studies suggest that the Antarctic \nPeninsula is currently contributing to global sea-level rise at a rate of 0.16 \u00b1 0.06 \nmm a-1, which is probably similar to other fast-changing, sub-polar glacier \nsystems such as Alaska. \nThe existing studies, however, only describe the broad connection between \nclimate change and the response of the cryosphere, the underlying changes in ice \nvolume are unknown. There are two main reasons for the current lack of data on \nthe Peninsula glaciers. Firstly, the size and remoteness of the region, steep \ntopography, and difficult surface conditions mean that most Antarctic Peninsula \nglaciers are inaccessible to field-workers and only a few in situ records of change \nexist (Morris and Mulvaney, 2004; Smith, et al., 1998).  Secondly, while more \nthan a decade of continuous satellite altimetry has allowed mapping of elevation \nchange for most of continental Antarctica, the changes in the volume of the \nAntarctic Peninsula ice-sheet remain unquantified because the ice slopes are too \nsteep for existing sensors. Whilst a new generation of satellite altimeters (e.g. \nCryosat-2 due for launch 2009\/2010) and time-variable gravity measurements \nfrom space (GRACE) may begin to measure change occurring over the next \ndecade, they cannot look back in time and warming has been underway for at least \n50 years. Thus there is an urgent need for an accurate assessment of changes in \n2 Photogrammetric Record, 17(9#), 200# \nNAME. Title of paper \nsurface height, and hence volume, of glaciers on the Antarctic Peninsula over past \ndecades, to aid better estimates of their past impact on sea-level rise and \npredictions of their future contribution.  \nSimilar difficulties apply to attempts to quantify changes in ice cover for \nother sub-polar and high-mountain regions known to be experiencing significant \nice loss such as Alaska, Southern Greenland, the Himalayas and Svalbard. \nThere is an archive of over 30,000 aerial photographs going back to the \n1940s for parts of the Antarctic Peninsula, held by the British Antarctic Survey \n(BAS), US Geological Survey and Royal Air Force. Similar collections exist for \nsome other polar and high-mountain areas. The photographs are 'time-capsules' of \ninformation about the glaciers in the region at the time they were taken. \nPhotogrammetry of time-series of these historic photographs is now the only way \nto reconstruct changes in glacier surface height and hence volume over the last \nfifty years. \nThere are well-established methods for measuring glacier volume change \nusing time-series photogrammetry, starting with graphical methods developed by \nFinsterwalder (1954), through to comparison of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) \nof glacier surfaces using digital photogrammetry and GIS systems (eg. Etzelm\u00fcller \net al., 1997; Rentsch, et al., 1990). Other parts of the world have long-running \nglacier monitoring programmes and there are many published studies using \nphotogrammetric methods for measuring glacier volume change (eg. Andreassen \net al., 2002; Favey et al., 2000). \nHowever, for the Antarctic Peninsula, the historic aerial photographs have \nalways been difficult to use for detailed measurements: (1) The remote rugged \nterrain has restricted field surveys so that ground control is sparse and inadequate \nfor photogrammetry in almost all areas; (2) The photographs were mainly flown \nfor regional reconnaissance and often have inconvenient sortie characteristics for \ndetailed study or individual glaciers; (3) Some of the photographs have lost their \ncalibration metadata in several changes of ownership over the fifty year period, \nand (4) The original negatives may be lost or are now damaged or degraded, so \nthat decades-old paper prints may have to be used. This risks introducing bias to \nthe photogrammetric measurements through the effects of paper distortion. \nThus, historic aerial photographs are an underused resource for measuring \nglacier volume change on the Antarctic Peninsula. Overcoming the problems \nhindering accurate photogrammetry could unlock a vast archive of glacier change \nmeasurements spanning 60 years.  \nThis paper describes a method to provide control for historic photos by \nlinking them to a newly-acquired, highly-accurate photogrammetric model. The \napproach of using recent photography to transfer control for adjustment of older \nepochs in difficult mountain environments has had limited use before, for example \nvon Barsch and Hell, (1975) in the Swiss Alps. Here we apply the method with \ndirect kinematic GPS positioning of the camera, to eliminate the need for surveyed \nground control in the remote and inaccessible Antarctic Peninsula. This paper \npresents a worked example for a glacier that has 5 epochs of aerial photography \ncoverage between 1947 and 2005 and an assessment of the achievable \nmeasurement accuracy. \nPhotogrammetric Record, 17(9#), 200# 3 \nFOX and CZIFERSZKY. Unlocking the time-capsule of historic aerial photography \nSELECTION AND LOCATION OF THE TEST GLACIER \nMoider glacier, on Pourquoi Pas Island, Antarctic Peninsula (Fig. 1) was \nselected as the test glacier for this study. It is about 50 km from the main BAS \nlogistics hub at Rothera Research Station. The rugged terrain is typical of the \nnorthern Antarctic Peninsula (Fig. 2) and presents a valid test for wider \napplication of the method in the region. The glacier flows westwards for 10 km \nfrom an upper bowl at about 800 m altitude, to reach the sea with a triangular \ntongue of floating ice at Dalgliesh Bay. The upper bowl is mainly smooth \nfeatureless snow, but parts of the lower part of the glacier are heavily crevassed, \nhave areas of avalanche debris and sastrugi (wind-sculpted surface features). The \nglacier develops a substantial glacial lake in most years and has substantial \nmoraines at its edges. The glacier is flanked by mountains rising steeply to ice-\ncovered summits at more than 1500 m, with soaring rock walls and narrow, \ncorniced ridges interspersed with ice-falls.  \nThe area is clearly difficult to access for field surveying, and prior to this \nstudy contained no ground-surveyed points. This site would present severe \ndifficulties for photogrammetry relying on orientation of the aerial photography to \nsurveyed ground control.  \nFour historic photography sets, spanning 1947 to 1991, are available, and \nthese include the camera\/lens types comprising the majority of the archival aerial \nphotography for the Antarctic Peninsula. New aerial photography was acquired in \n2005 specially for this study, using direct GPS measurement of the camera \npositions. \nDATA \nAerial photography \nThe cameras and lenses used for the aerial photography of Moider Glacier, \nand the availability of calibration metadata and original negatives are summarised \nin Table I.  \nThe Ronne Antarctic Research Expedition aerial photography from 1947 has \nno calibration metadata and is only available as paper-prints, similarly the \nnegatives are unavailable for the BAS 1991 photography and paper prints were \nused. \nThe image quality of the FIDASE photography is fairly poor; the images are \nnot completely sharp and the negatives are rather scratched. This is attributed to \nthe processing of the negatives in less than ideal laboratory conditions on location \nin Antarctica and some deterioration over the intervening 50 years. The area \ncoverage of the different sorties is shown in Fig. 3. \nNew photography for this project was acquired by BAS in January 2005 \nusing a Zeiss RMK camera modified to support direct kinematic GPS \nmeasurement of the camera centres. The processing results for the kinematic GPS, \nover a 50 km baseline from the GPS base-station at Rothera, showed an RMS \naccuracy of 0.02 m. Before and after track crossings, on the runway apron, were \n4 Photogrammetric Record, 17(9#), 200# \nNAME. Title of paper \nwithin 0.05 m in elevation. The aircraft travelled at 60 m\/sec (~120 knots \/ 220 \nkph) during the sortie. The GPS sample interval was 1 Hz and the actual camera \npositions were interpolated within the 1-second sample intervals. Whilst a Twin \nOtter aircraft is a fairly stable platform over 1 second at 4,500 m altitude, the \ninterpolated camera positions will be less accurate than the directly measured GPS \ndata points. Examination of randomly chosen strings of successive 1-second \ninterval GPS position fixes from the sortie showed that the aircraft trajectory was \nstable and not prone to short-period variability. The RMS values of the altitude \ndifferences between successive fixes were between 0.4 and 0.6 m over a period of \none minute. Thus, interpolation of the camera centres between the 1-second \nsamples is likely to be accurate to a few cm and not a major source of error for this \nproject.  \nOnly the BAS 2005, IfAG 1989 and FIDASE 1957 aerial photography cover \nthe whole glacier. Fig. 3 shows that the glacier lies on an approximately East to \nWest axis, but the historic aerial photography was either flown on a North to \nSouth axis (FIDASE, IfAG) or diagonal to the glaciers (RARE, BAS 1991).  The \nRARE and BAS 1991 aerial photographs were flown at 3000 metres altitude, but \nthe terrain in the area is over 1000 metres in places, so there are areas of \u2018dead-\nground\u2019 that cannot be seen in stereo, and areas with extreme relief-distortion in \nthe mountainous parts of the photographs. \nAll the photographs are panchromatic, except the BAS 2005 photographs, \nwhich used colour negative film and they were all scanned at 20 microns \nresolution using a photogrammetric-standard scanner. \n \nTABLE I.

Unlocking the time-capsule of historic aerial photography \ngood practice to have some surveyed ground-control in the project to check for \ngross or systematic errors in the airborne kinematic GPS data.  \nThe rugged terrain severely limits suitable places for ground-surveyed \ncontrol points, but we acquired 5 GPS surveyed ground control points for this \nproject with helicopter support from HMS Endurance for access.  \nDue to the limited opportunity for access to the test site it was not possible to \nplace ground targets prior to the aerial photography. The ground control points \nwere chosen on conspicuous ground features that were expected to be clearly \nvisible on the BAS 2005 aerial photography. The processing statistics for the five \npoints show that the Ground Control Points are accurate to better than 10 cm in X, \nY and Z. This is much better than the measurement precision from the \nphotography, which is limited by the ground resolution of the photographs, (0.6 m \nfor the BAS 2005 photography). \nMETHOD \nThe overall method is to:  \n1. Build a high-accuracy photogrammetric block of the new (BAS 2005), \nGPS supported aerial photography through a bundle adjustment.  \n2. Transfer secondary control points from the 2005 block to the historic \nphotographs to achieve a photogrammetric orientation for all the photographs. \n3. Define the glacier surface at each epoch as a DEM derived from \nphotogrammetric height measurement samples (post points). \n4. Difference the DEMs from different epochs to detect change in glacier \nthickness and hence volume over time. \nOrientation of the BAS 2005 aerial photography  \nThe 2005 GPS-supported aerial photography block comprised 53 \nphotographs flown as three strips with cross strips at each end. It will now be \nknown as the primary block. It was block-adjusted, using Leica Photogrammetry \nsuite (LPS) software, to the directly-measured camera centres and a total of 254 \ntie-points.  The effectiveness of external orientation with GPS-measured camera \ncentres is long established in the literature, for example Lucas (1987); Gruen, et al. \n(1993); Ackermann (1994) and many others.  \nThe initial adjustement and all subsequent analyses used a Lambert Conformal \nConic coordinate system with WGS84 as the horizontal datum and a tide gauge at \nRothera research station as the vertical datum. \nThe tie-points were manually measured to one-pixel precision on clearly \ndefined features such as crevasse intersections and snow patches on rock, well \ndistributed throughout the block. Whilst the GPS ground-surveyed points were \naccurate to a few cm, they could only be identified with a precision of about 2 m \non the photographs. They were only used to initialise the block-adjustment, \nrequired by the LPS software, and to check for gross and systematic errors and \nwere excluded from later iterations of the adjustment and the final block. \nThe maximum residuals in the block-adjustment exterior orientations for the \n53 photographs were 0.19, 0.13 and 0.19 m in X, Y and Z directions. The mean \n6 Photogrammetric Record, 17(9#), 200# \nNAME. Title of paper \nresiduals of the tie-points were respectively 0.18, 0.20 and 0.31 m with standard \ndeviations of less than 0.1 m. Thus the primary block is considered accurate to \nbetter than 0.5 m in X, Y and Z and is regarded as a reliable baseline for extracting \nsecondary control for the historic photographs. \nMethod for linking the primary block and historic aerial photography \nWe used a 3-stage process to achieve a photogrammetric orientation for the \ndifferent historic aerial photo sets, by tying them to secondary control derived \nfrom the primary block. \n1. An extra class of tie-points was added to the primary block, chosen on \npermanent features such as local summits on ridges, rock outcrops and large \nboulders that could be identified on both the new aerial photographs and each of \nthe historic photography sets in turn. The points did not have to be identical \nbetween the historic photo sets. Obviously, features subject to change over the \ntime-period, such as crevasses, could not be used. \n2. Re-adjustment of only the primary block, including tie-points common \nwith the historic photos, holding the external orientation parameters fixed, to \nderive coordinates for the secondary control points with a known precision from \nthe block-adjustment statistics. \n3. Separate photogrammetric orientation of the historic photos using the \nsecondary control points, supplemented by new tie-points as necessary. \nThis procedure was carried out for each of the four historic datasets to \nachieve five photogrammetric projects spanning 1947 to 2005, which could then \nbe used for measurement of glacier surface change over time. The main difficulty \nwas finding enough points on stable features that could be identified with \nprecision on the different photographs. This was due to a combination of the \nrugged terrain with little visible rock, the wide variation in seasonal snow cover on \nthe photographs and significant differences in perspective resulting from the \ndifferent flying directions and photo-scale of the sorties. Nevertheless, it was \npossible to find enough points for each photography type to give substantial \nredundancy and a satisfactory adjustment (Table II). \nWe considered adding all the historic photos into the primary block and \nperforming a simultaneous \u2018grand adjustment\u2019 of all the photography in the study. \nWhilst this is more elegant and initially attractive, we rejected it due to increased \ndifficulties with detecting errors in the block and data handling, and to ensure that \nthe primary block remained unaffected.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPhotogrammetric Record, 17(9#), 200# 7 \nFOX and CZIFERSZKY.

Whilst the Fairchild K17 camera used did not expose a data \nstrip inclusing the focal length onto each frame, the calibrated focal length had \nbeen written onto the negative of the first frame of each film. However, the \nfiducial coordinates and the radial lens distortion characteristics are unknown and \nhad to be approximated for this study. \nThe Fairchild K17 camera used Metrogon lenses, which are known to have \nmaximum radial distortions of over 100 microns, compared with less than 5 \nmicrons for a modern aerial photography camera lens. Hothmer (1958) computed \nthe effects of uncorrected radial lens distortion for a typical metrogon lens on \nheight measurement accuracy to be maximum measurement error of up to 1\u2030 of \nthe flying height, (3 m for the RARE photography used here) and more than 0.25 \n\u2030 for about \u00be of a stereo-pair.  This level of error is unacceptable to achieve the \nprecision required for the glacier change study and requires calculation or \napproximation of the unknown radial lens distortion parameters to reduce the \nheight measurement error to acceptable levels. \nSelf-calibrating bundle adjustment (SCBA) is an established technique to \ncalculate unknown calibration parameters or other systematic influences on the \nphotogrammetric adjustment. Chandler and Cooper (1989), for example, \ndemonstrated its potential for back-calculating missing calibration parameters for \nhistoric aerial photographs, achieving an average precision of 1 m RMS for \n8 Photogrammetric Record, 17(9#), 200# \nNAME.

However this requires redundancy in \nthe computations, which can achieved through increasing the amount of ground \ncontrol and flying the aerial photography as a block with large overlaps. \nIn practice SCBA is very difficult to apply successfully to historic aerial \nphotography of mountainous, remote polar areas such as the RARE photographs \nin this study. Adequate numbers of ground control points are very difficult to \nacquire and identify on the historic photos with the precision required for \nsuccessful SCBA. Finally, the RARE photography was acquired as the vertical \ncomponent of a horizon-to-horizon tri-camera system, and has no overlap between \nadjacent vertical strips, this further increases the requirement for ground-control \nfor a reliable SCBA .  \nThus, for this project we rejected a SCBA approach and instead \napproximated the distortion curve for the RARE photography by applying a \ngeneric curve derived from the characteristics of many other lenses of the same \ntype (Sewell, 1954). Sewell studied 276 Metrogon lenses to establish whether the \nlenses were sufficiently similar to justify mechanical correction for radial \ndistortion for the analogue stereo-plotters of the day with a universal \ncompensation device. This is a very similar problem to seeking to apply a \nuniversal curve to a camera with known lens type but unknown detailed \ncalibration parameters.  He found that for 48% of the lenses the calibrated curve \nvaried less than 10 microns from the average curve of the 276 samples, and for \n74% less than 15 microns, with an overall maximum difference of about 50 \nmicrons. Applying the Sewell generic curve was expected to reduce the maximum \nresidual radial distortion to 20 microns and the maximum height error from this \nsource to about 0.2 \u2030 flying height, or 0.6 m for the RARE photography.  \nEffects on accuracy of using paper prints for RARE and BAS 1991 \nPaper warping in decades-old photographic paper prints can introduce \nsignificant bias and hence error to photogrammetric surface height measurements. \nThe affine transformation normally carried out during the photogrammetric inner \norientation stage minimises the overall effects of paper distortion at the fiducial \nmarks, but paper warping within the photograph frame remains unknown. In order \nto assess the likely size of this uncorrected warping and its possible impact on \nheight measurement accuracy for this study we analysed a sample of six \nphotographs from a set of photographs from 1969 that were acquired using a \nFairchild  F49 metric camera fitted with a calibrated reseau grid. The photographs \nhad been stored under the same conditions as the 1947 RARE photographs for at \nleast the last 17 years and we assumed that the response of the photographic paper \nwas similar and that the observed distortions were due to paper warping and not \ncamera problems such as lack of film flatness. Comparison of the calibrated \ncoordinates for each of the 144 crosses in the reseau with measurements made \nafter inner orientation showed complex patterns of warping, unaccounted for by \nPhotogrammetric Record, 17(9#), 200# 9 \nFOX and CZIFERSZKY. Unlocking the time-capsule of historic aerial photography \nthe inner orientation, reaching over 100 microns in places.  There is complex \ninter-play between the distortions in the stereo-overlap on adjacent photographs, \nbut their effects on parallax could introduce typical errors of about 1.5 metres at \n3,000 m flying height, with local anomalies of up to 5 metres. Furthermore, the \nmagnitude, direction and distribution of the residual distortions are not sufficiently \nconsistent from photograph to photograph to be modelled and applied as a \ncorrection. Most aerial photography does not have the reseau grid and there is thus \nno way to directly measure the likely effects of residual paper distortions in the \npractical case, so it is imperative that the original negatives are used for accurate \nwork from historic photographs wherever possible. \nFor the glacier change project we concluded that height measurement errors \nfrom paper distortion of 1.5 to 2.0 m were plausible for the RARE photography set \nand included these effects in the overall error budget.  \nThe BAS 1991 aerial photography was also only available as paper prints. \nHowever comparing the calibrated and measured fiducial coordinates suggested \nthat paper-warping effects were much less severe. This is attributed to the use of \nmodern, more stable, resin-coated photographic paper for these prints. \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \nBlock adjustment results for the historic photographs \nThe block adjustment results for the BAS 2005 primary block were described \nabove.  The adjustment results for the four types of historic aerial photography are \nsummarised in Table II. \nThe X and Y (longitude\/latitude) accuracy of all the datasets was better than \n2 metres. These errors are insignificant for elevation measurement accuracy on the \ngently sloping glacier surface, where even the steeper upper parts of the glacier \nhave a gradient of less than 10%, and will not be discussed further. \nWith incomplete metadata and the use of paper prints, the RARE \nphotographs are the worst-case data for this study, and it was expected that the \nbundle-adjustment results would be much poorer than for the other datasets. The \nelevation control point RMSE from 13 control points derived from the primary \nblock was 1.8 m, with the largest residual 4.0 m and the maximum tie-point Z \nresidual was 2.1 m. The total image unit-weight RMSE, which measures the \noverall precision of the control and tie-point measurements on the photographs, \nwas 36.5 microns; this is an acceptable value and is still less than 2 pixels. Overall \nthe results show that the measurements were noisier than for the other datasets, but \nwere better than expected. The lower precision reflects the approximated radial \ndistortion data and paper warping and lower image sharpness from using scanned \npaper-prints. \nThe FIDASE photography set included a total of 20 control points, which \nwere measured 67 times on the photographs. The elevation RMSE value for the \ncontrol points was 1.3 m. The total image unit weight RMSE was 31.8 microns, \n10 Photogrammetric Record, 17(9#), 200# \nNAME. Title of paper \nabout 0.9 m on the ground, showing that overall the tie-points were measured with \nhigh precision.  However, there were a few outliers in the individual \nmeasurements so that the maximum control and tie-point z residuals were 2.8 m \nand 3.4 m, indicating that the photo-coordinate measurements are noisier. This is \nattributed to the slight loss of sharpness and scratched condition of the negatives. \nThe IfAG photography had 12 control points, measured in 23 instances on \nthe photographs. The elevation RMSE of the control point measurements was 1.2 \nm. The total image unit weight RMSE was 11.3 microns and the maximum \nresiduals were all less than 2 metres. These are excellent results from this high-\naltitude, super-wide-angle-lens photography, and reflect the extremely high image \nquality of this photography set. \nThe BAS 1991 photography has camera calibration data, but only paper \nprints were available for this study. A total of 14 control points were derived from \nthe primary block and they were measured 34 times on the photographs. The \ncontrol point elevation RMSE was 0.5 m. The total unit weight RMSE was 15.6 \nmicrons, which is higher than the values achieved from the similar Zeiss RMK \ncameras used for the BAS 2005 and IfAG 1989 photography sets; this will be due \nto warping of the paper prints scanned for this study rather than dimensionally-\nstable negatives. Nevertheless, the maximum residuals were all less than 2 metres. \nThese are very good results from paper prints and indicate a high-quality \nadjustment for the photographs. \nTaken together the block-adjustment results show that the method of \ntransferring ground control from well-constrained aerial photography with direct \nGPS measurement of the camera centres can achieve photogrammetric \norientations for difficult-to-use historic photographs of better than 2 metres RMSE \nin latitude, longitude and elevation.  \nThe main constraints are: firstly, the availability of points that can be \nprecisely identified on the photographs, especially with different levels of snow \ncover and different perspective, and secondly, the image quality, where working \nwith paper prints or deteriorating negatives leads to poorer results. \n \nMeasurement precision for the historic photography \nThe orientation accuracy of the photogrammetric model is only one factor \naffecting the overall measurement accuracy of the glacier surface heights. This \nwill be a combination of the orientation accuracy and the precision of the \nphotogrammetric measurements from the images. We tested the achievable \nmeasurement precision for each of the photography types by collecting 20 \nindependent measurements for a randomly chosen object point on the glacier \nsurface (using Leica Stereo-Analyst software) and calculating the standard \ndeviation and maximum residual for each phot set.  \nThe results are given in Table III and show that the key factors are photo-\nscale\/ground resolution and image quality. The image quality of the IfAG \nphotography is very high, but the resolution is lower and so the standard deviation \nand greatest residual values are higher than the BAS 2005 photographs taken with \nPhotogrammetric Record, 17(9#), 200# 11 \nFOX and CZIFERSZKY. Unlocking the time-capsule of historic aerial photography \nthe same camera type and similarly scanned from the negatives. For the other \nphoto sets with photo-scales between 1:20,000 and 1:30,000 image quality is the \nkey factor; the lowest image quality FIDASE photographs have the poorest \nmeasurement consistency. Using scanned paper prints does not appear to affect \nmeasurement precision greatly; the results for the BAS 1991 and RARE photosets, \nwhich were both paper prints are good. As was expected, the BAS 2005 \nphotographs, which were scanned from negatives with a high image quality \nallowed the best measurement consistency. Nevertheless, a measurement precision \nwith a standard deviation of better than 0.6 m and with a greatest residual of less \nthan 1 metre was achieved for all the photo sets. \nThe overall accuracy of the surface elevations is also likely to be lower in \nareas with poor surface texture, where it is difficult to make high quality \nphotogrammetric measurements. This problem has long been recognised as a \nconstraint for photogrammetry on glaciers. Minimising the effects of low surface \ntexture on measurement accuracy depends on operator skill and discipline not to \ninclude measurements with low confidence. \n \nTABLE III.

However, in \npractice this is difficult to apply because suitable places on ridges, summits and \nnunataks are scarce and have usually been used as secondary control point \nlocations. The bundle-adjustment process minimizes error at the control points, so \ncheck points located close to the GCPs are not a valid test of accuracy. Suitable \npoints could only be found for the FIDASE photographs, but this is the dataset \nwith the highest maximum control point and tie-point block adjustment residuals \nand thus potentially the most variable error throughout the block. The mean of the \nerrors at 5 sample points was \u20131.0 m, showing a negative bias, with a standard \ndeviation of 0.8 m, these values are in line with the orientation results.  \n12 Photogrammetric Record, 17(9#), 200# \nNAME. Title of paper \nSuperimposition of contours for the rocky areas compiled from the 2005 data  in \nstereo-models with the historic photographs gives a useful subjective assessment \nof their photogrammetric orientation quality. \nAll the photo sets had substantial coverage of the coastline, and so we used \nthe high-water mark and fast-ice (sea-ice which is fastened to the shoreline and \nnot moving) as an independent check of elevation accuracy. The high-water mark \nis believed to be about 1 m at this location and about 0.25 m is a plausible \nfreeboard for old fast ice. The results from the check measurements are \nsummarized in Table IV. They exceeded our expectations from the \nphotogrammetric orientation results and are taken to confirm the effectiveness of \nthe technique. \nA further imponderable is the effect of seasonal and inter-annual variations in \nthe snow cover on the glacier. Most of the photographs used in this study were \nacquired in January, but the RARE photographs were taken in November. The \ndifferent photo sets show a great variation in snow cover on the beaches, moraines \nand nunataks, which indicate that there is likely to be a significant variation in the \nglacier snow cover also, at least in the lower parts of the glaciers. Annual snowfall \nis probably about 2 m for this part of the Antarctic Peninsula, (van Lipzig et al., \n2004). Thus, variations in the snow cover according to the time of year of the \nphotographs could be as significant as the precision of the photogrammetric \nmeasurements.  \nTABLE IV.

Hence Moider glacier was chosen as a test site primarily \nfor the range of historic aerial photograph types and ease of access from Rothera \nResearch Station, rather than for having ideal surface characteristics for \nphotogrammetry. \nNevertheless, we here present a comparison of glacier surface DEMs at the \nfive epochs. For each epoch, data points were digitized on the glacier surface \nusing Leica Stereo-Analyst software and then DEMs generated using the Inverse \nDistance Weighted strategy in ESRI\u2019s ArcScene software.  \nBecause surface texture was not a key factor in choice of study glacier poor \nground texture prevented photogrammetric height measurement for some areas at \nsome epochs. Two study areas were defined by intersecting areas with an \nPhotogrammetric Record, 17(9#), 200# 13 \nFOX and CZIFERSZKY. Unlocking the time-capsule of historic aerial photography \nacceptable data point density of the 1957, 1989 and 2005 epoch, and all five \nepochs respectively (labelled 1 and 2 in Fig. 4). Differential DEMs were \ncalculated for the study areas and as a result the total ice volume change over the \ndifferent epochs was calculated, defining the most recent dataset (2005) as a null \ndataset. Results with error bars (which have been calculated from the surface \nheight RMSE of each epoch) are shown in Fig. 5. The size of the error bars \ncompared to the absolute volume change show that the signal to noise ratio with \nthis method is acceptable for identifying trends in deglaciation.   \nCONCLUSIONS \nThis study shows that the method of transferring control from highly accurate \nGPS-supported photogrammetry to difficult-to-use historic photographs is \neffective under the constraints below.  \nThe results show that the primary GPS-supported aerial photography can be \norientated with an accuracy of better than 0.5 m. Secondary ground control points \ncan be transferred to other historic photosets to allow their photogrammetric \norientation to be better than 2 m RMSE in X, Y and Z, even for photographs using \npaper prints and approximated calibration metadata. Measurements of elevation \nfor surfaces with good texture can be made with a consistency of better than 0.6 m \nstandard deviation and a greatest residual of better than 1 m. Overall measurement \naccuracy of better than 2 m for all the photo sets was supported by comparison \nwith limited independent check data. \nThe main limitations on measurement accuracy are the image quality for the \nhistoric photographs and using paper prints. The well-known inability to measure \nareas with featureless snow surfaces remains an intrinsic limitation for \nphotogrammetry on glaciers. Variations in snow-cover due to time of year and \ninter-annual differences may be as important for the overall results as the \nphotogrammetric measurement accuracy. \nThis method is a significant step forward for measuring glacier volume \nchange on the Antarctic Peninsula, where difficulties with acquiring adequate \nground-surveyed photo-control and the characteristics of the historic photography \nhave always hampered photogrammetry.  The research also demonstrates the \nimportance of maintaining and updating the photographic archive.  \nWe are now seeking to apply the method in a larger-scale study to measure \nvolume change for benchmark glaciers on the Antarctic Peninsula. \n \nNEXT STEPS \n \nWe are now seeking to apply the method in a larger-scale study to measure \nvolume change for 14 benchmark glaciers on the Antarctic Peninsula. \nAny attempt to apply the method to a larger number of glaciers and \nphotographs would require further automation of the method to increase \nefficiency. In the method described here, the most time-consuming stages are \ncollecting tie-points for orientation of the new reference photography and \nmeasuring the surface height samples.  \n14 Photogrammetric Record, 17(9#), 200# \nNAME. Title of paper \nOne clear opportunity for improving efficiency is direct measurement of full \nexterior orientation parameters for the new reference photography with an \nINS\/GPS system, thus eliminating the need for laborious tie-point measurement. \nAlternatively automated tie-point measurement could also speed exterior \norientation of the reference photography sets. \nAutomated generation of DEMs for the glacier surfaces with the image \nmatching methods now fully implemented in photogrammetric software would be \ncritical for any large-scale programme of photogrammetric glacier surface \nmeasurement. However, sparse surface texture for some Antarctic Peninsula \nglaciers is likely to limit efficiency gains from this method. \n  \nREFERENCES \nACKERMANN, F., 1994.
