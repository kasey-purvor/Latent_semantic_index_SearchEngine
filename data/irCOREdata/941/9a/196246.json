To enable patients to be effective\nself-managers of their diabetes, they need to be provided with\nthe information and support necessary to make informed\ndecisions [2]. Internet-based interventions to aid\nself-management have the potential to assist patients by offering\naccess to these resources from their own homes, schools, or\nworkplaces and at times when they are most in need of them.\nA number of recent Internet-based interventions have been\nreported on for use with patients with diabetes [3-10], and a\npilot study has shown the feasibility of patients with type 2\ndiabetes co-managing their condition from home [11]. Most of\nthe studies have assessed the usage or usability of their\ntelemedicine systems [3-6,8-11]; some have assessed biological\nmeasures, namely HbA1c [3-5,7,9,11]; and one has reported on\npsychological measurements [5]. Results often indicate\nimprovements in HbA1c values but limited improvements in\nJ Med Internet Res 2009 | vol. 11 | iss. 1 | e10 | p.1http:\/\/www.jmir.org\/2009\/1\/e10\/\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nJennings et alJOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH\nXSL\u2022FO\nRenderX\npsychological measurements. Many of the systems have shown\nfeasibility and potential benefits for improvement of diabetes\ncare.\nThe systems developed for these interventions were often based\non the uploading of biological measurements, whilst others\nprovided patients with access to online self-management\n\u201ccoaches\u201d. As a result, these interventions have commonly used\ncomplex and bespoke systems; few have used freely available\ncommunities. In order for an Internet-based system to be\neffective, it needs to employ a simple user interface to collect\na minimum amount of data [12]. In the current study, a\npre-existing virtual clinic prototype was developed as an\nintervention to aid diabetes self-management, one aimed at\npatients who used insulin pumps to manage their diabetes.\nContinuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), or pump\ntherapy, is a method of administering insulin over twenty-four\nhours via a small needle or cannula inserted under the skin. The\npump delivers insulin continuously with an additional boost\nprogrammed and administered by the patient to match food or\nreduce raised blood glucose levels [13]. There are a number of\nreasons why patients may be recommended for CSII. These\ninclude inadequate glycemic control with other treatment\noptions, marked variability in glucose on a day-to-day basis, a\nhistory of hyperglycemia unawareness, a need for flexibility in\nlifestyle, pregnancy, insulin sensitivity and low insulin\nrequirements [14]. This particular group has not been studied\nin any of the previous interventions referenced, despite insulin\npump patients showing a great deal of interest in their condition\nand motivation towards self-management [15].\nCommunity support is believed to be a fundamental aspect of\ndisease self-management, and when peer-support elements are\nincorporated into Internet-based interventions for diabetes, they\nare often the most used components [5,10]. The benefits of peer\nsupport in relation to health include: decreased feelings of\nisolation, promotion of positive psychological states and\nincreased motivation, deterring maladaptive behaviors, and\nproviding information on the benefits of behaviors that\npositively influence health [16]. Studies have shown that\ndiscussion forums and chat rooms can have a positive effect on\nparticipants by helping them to cope better with diabetes [17].\nSelf-efficacy can also increase the successful self-management\nof diabetes. The theory of self-efficacy proposes that an\nindividual\u2019s confidence in their ability to perform a certain\nbehavior influences which behavior they will engage in, how\nmuch effort will be expended, and how long they will persist\nin it [18]. Interventions based on self-efficacy theory have been\nshown to be significantly more effective than those that are not\n[19].\nIn addition to ensuring that the content of an intervention\nincreases self-efficacy, it is important that a system meets patient\nneeds and is designed in conjunction with potential users. Hence,\nextensive stakeholder consultation [20] and preliminary testing\n[21] were undertaken to ensure public and patient involvement\nat all stages of the system\u2019s development. Following this\npatient-centered approach, we report here on pilot testing of the\nInternet-based virtual clinic for patients using insulin pumps to\nmanage their diabetes. We aimed to explore the feasibility,\nacceptability, and effectiveness of the system.\nMethods\nSystem Design\nThe virtual clinic system offered three main Internet-based\nfunctions: communication with health professionals, interaction\nwith peers, and access to information (Figure 1 and Figure 2).\nThe site was password protected and only available to the\nparticipants involved and those working directly on the study.\nCommunication with health professionals was provided via 6\nonline \u201cask an expert\u201d sessions conducted with diabetes\nspecialists not directly involved with the patients care. These\nsessions were conducted via the sites asynchronous discussion\nforums which were open to all who could access the site.\nParticipants were also able to confidentially email their own\nhealth professionals at any time and were told to expect a reply\nwithin two working days. Interaction with peers was provided\nvia discussion boards and synchronous chat. Discussion board\nmoderation was reactive in that the boards were checked\nregularly by the study coordinator, and participants were\nencouraged to report any inappropriate postings. Information\non diabetes was provided on the site and via Web links to further\nsources, including Diabetes UK [22] and sites specific to patients\nusing insulin pumps such as Pumpers UK [23] and Promoting\nInsulin Pump Therapy (INPUT) [24].\nSample\nParticipants were recruited by convenience sampling from three\nUK hospitals in the West and East Midlands. As the sample\nwas drawn on the basis of opportunity, recruitment was\nconvenient and not time consuming; however, it did increase\nthe risk of bias and the possibility of obtaining a\nnon-representative sample.\nJ Med Internet Res 2009 | vol. 11 | iss. 1 | e10 | p.2http:\/\/www.jmir.org\/2009\/1\/e10\/\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nJennings et alJOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH\nXSL\u2022FO\nRenderX\nFigure 1.

Screenshots of the virtual clinic: discussion forum\nClinicians issued recruitment packs, which consisted of a letter\ninviting patients to participate and an information sheet outlining\nthe research, to all patients in their diabetes clinics who currently\nused insulin pumps. Patients were informed that participation\nwas voluntary and refusing participation or withdrawing from\nthe study would not affect their current standard of care. Ethical\napproval for the study was obtained from the West Midlands\nMulti-Centre Ethics Committee.\nAll the participants were over 18 years of age, had used an\ninsulin pump for at least 6 months, could communicate\neffectively in written and spoken English, had Internet access,\nand self-reported basic computer literacy. While still receiving\nnormal care, participants were asked to use the virtual clinic for\nJ Med Internet Res 2009 | vol. 11 | iss. 1 | e10 | p.3http:\/\/www.jmir.org\/2009\/1\/e10\/\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nJennings et alJOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH\nXSL\u2022FO\nRenderX\na period of 6 months, logging on at least once a week and using\nthe features within it as often as they wished.\nMeasures\nThe feasibility of the virtual clinic system was determined from\nrecruitment, retention, and usage rates; acceptability was\nmonitored by participant evaluation and informal feedback; and\neffectiveness was measured by a comparison of pre- and\npost-test results. Outcome measures were selected following a\nreview of similar studies in this area. As this was a pilot study,\nit was important to choose measures that would provide\nfeedback in a range of areas, including psychological and\nphysiological. This allowed for a thorough assessment of the\nintervention and its impact on participants.\nDemographic information was recorded using a self-report\nquestionnaire at baseline. Pre-study HbA1c values were\nobtained, with permission, from patients\u2019 files. Self-efficacy\nwas assessed by the Confidence in Diabetes Self-Care Scale\n(CIDS) [25] and quality of life by the Audit of Diabetes\nDependent Quality of Life (ADDQoL) questionnaire [26].\nParticipants completed questionnaires by hand and returned\nthem by post.\nThe CIDS scale is a 21-item self-report questionnaire that covers\ndomains of self-care (eg, insulin administration and blood\nglucose monitoring). The scale was developed to assess\nself-efficacy, specifically in adults with type 1 diabetes. Its\nadvantages are that it is a short instrument that has shown high\nreliability and validity. Respondents are required to score items\non a five-point Likert scale from 1 (\u201cNo, I am sure I cannot\u201d)\nto 5 (\u201cYes, I am sure I can\u201d). A total score is then calculated by\nsumming all items and converting them to a 0-100 scale, with\nhigher scores indicating higher self-efficacy [25].\nThe ADDQoL questionnaire measures patients\u2019 perceptions of\nthe impact of diabetes on their quality of life with the underlying\nprinciple that only personally applicable domains are rated by\nrespondents. The questionnaire consists of 18 life domains (eg,\nfamily life, employment, and holidays), and users rate the impact\nof diabetes on each particular domain and the importance of\nthat domain for their quality of life. A score of +9 is the\nmaximum positive impact of diabetes and -9 the maximum\nnegative impact of diabetes [26]. The advantage of using the\nADDQoL questionnaire is that, unlike other quality of life\nmeasures that only assess patients\u2019 satisfaction with treatment,\na broader range of topics influenced by diabetes, its treatment,\nand any complications are covered. Furthermore, the\nquestionnaire allows patients to rate only those areas of life that\nare important to their quality of life.\nAfter using the virtual clinic for a 6-month period, the CIDS\nand ADDQoL questionnaires were reissued for completion, and\npatients\u2019 latest HbA1c measurements were taken if a new test\nhad been completed during the study period. Participants\u2019\nexperiences were assessed at the end of the intervention using\nquestionnaires and qualitative interviews. Five participants\ncompleted interviews and were purposively selected by usage,\nage, and gender to ensure the sample was representative of users.\nAll interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. Usage\nstatistics were available from the system and recorded as the\nnumber of page views.\nStatistical Analysis\nPaired sample t tests were used to evaluate changes from pre-\nto post-test. A Wilcoxon Signed rank test was used to examine\ndifferences in the CIDS scores as they were not normally\ndistributed. Data were considered statistically significant at P\n< .05. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the usability\nquestionnaires and the qualitative interviews were analyzed\nusing content analysis.\nResults\nThe age range of the participants who joined the virtual clinic\n(6 males, 11 females) was 22 to 70 years. On average,\nrespondents had been diagnosed with diabetes for 23.5 years\n(SD 14.0, range 3 - 58) and had used insulin pumps for 2.8 years\n(SD 1.6, range 1 - 6). All were described as being of white,\nBritish ancestry. Those educated to the undergraduate level or\nabove numbered 8 (47%). The participants all described\nthemselves as regular Internet users. The Internet was used\neveryday by 11 (65%), and most used it more than once a week.\nOn average, respondents used the Internet for 8.9 hours a week\n(SD 5.9, range 0.25 - 20) (Table 1).\nFeasibility\nThrough recruitment, 19 patients were invited to take part in\nthe intervention, and 17 joined the virtual clinic. One participant\nwithdrew during the 6-month trial, and 4 participants failed to\ncomplete post-test questionnaires, despite using the virtual clinic\nfor the full 6 months.\nFigure 3 shows the usage of the virtual clinic and how this\nchanged over time. In the first month, 648 page views were\nrecorded, and this increased to 971 in the second month. Usage\nthen gradually declined, and only 151 page views were recorded\nin the final month.\nAcceptability\nThe system was rated positively by 7 users (58%) for \u201cease of\nuse\u201d with the remaining 5 (42%) rating it neutrally in the\npost-test questionnaires. The design of the system was rated\npositively by 9 users (75%), and only one user gave it a negative\nrating.\nDespite the decline in usage, post-test interviews highlighted\nthe fact that the intervention was very well accepted. Comments\nfrom participants included: \u201c[T]he general contact and the\nfacility to be able to get advice, or ask opinions of other\npeople\u2026without it [the virtual clinic] there isn\u2019t that facility\u201d\nand \u201c[I]t was a very positive experience\u201d. Almost all users\nagreed that participation in the virtual clinic had reassured them\nabout their diabetes. Only one user expressed on the usability\nquestionnaire that the experience of using the system was \u201ca\nwaste of time\u201d.\nJ Med Internet Res 2009 | vol. 11 | iss. 1 | e10 | p.4http:\/\/www.jmir.org\/2009\/1\/e10\/\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nJennings et alJOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH\nXSL\u2022FO\nRenderX\nFigure 3. Number of page views per month\nIt was clear that users found online peer support the most\nvaluable aspect of the intervention. The comfort they took in\nmeeting others of like experience was expressed by two users\nwho said, \u201cjust to have communication\u2014to realise you are not\nthe only person in the world like this\u201d;\u201cit has been so nice to\nrealise that your problems are not unique and you\u2019re not on your\nown trying to solve them\u201d. This probably explains why the\ndiscussion board was the most used feature, with participants\ncommenting that involvement was both \u201cuseful and reassuring\u201d.\nThere were 34 topics posted on the discussion board and 219\nthreads. Issues discussed included technical\/management\nproblems, seeking and providing emotional support, and general\ninformation seeking. No incidences of inappropriate postings\nwere reported.\nIt became clear that some users posted considerably more\nthreads than others. The most active user posted 25% of the\ndiscussion board threads. However, a post-test interview with\na very low frequency user revealed that \u201cnot being so active\ndidn\u2019t mean that I didn\u2019t think it was useful\u201d, and another user\ncommented that \u201cif there is nothing else you need to know then\nthat is incredibly helpful\u201d. Participation in the discussion board\nwas decribed as useful by 9 users (75%), and all users highly\nrated the virtual clinic in terms of improving communication\nwith other people with diabetes.\nFew users felt that participation in the virtual clinic had\nimproved communication with their clinical team. Although in\nthe follow-up interviews, participants did suggest that some\nfeatures such as ordering equipment and contacting diabetes\nnurses were very helpful. Others commented that they did not\nparticipate in the \u201cask-an-expert\u201d sessions because they were\nuncomfortable with using discussion forums or they simply did\nnot have any questions to ask. In addition, the participants\nhighlighted the fact that that contacting a clinic team for\nanything other than general questions would be futile, since\nwithout providing a detailed background to a problem,\nprofessionals would not be able to help.\nParticipants reported using the links to further information less\nthan the other two components. Many stated they used the links\ninitially but did not revisit them during the intervention. Despite\nthis, only one of the participants said the links were of no use\nto them.\nEffectiveness\nRegarding HbA1c measurements, there was no significant\ndifference found between the pre- and post-test results (P =\n.53). Because measurements were taken from patients\u2019 files,\nfollow up results were only available for participants who had\nbeen re-tested by their health care team during the 6-month\nstudy period (n = 8, 47%) (Table 1).\nMean ADDQoL scores (Table 1) at baseline were -2.1 (SD 1.1,\nrange -3.4 to -0.5) compared to -2.0 (SD 1.2, range, -4.6 to -0.4)\npost-test (n = 12), (P = .62). Surprisingly, patients\u2019 confidence\nin their ability to perform self-care tasks was found to be\nsignificantly reduced from baseline to follow up (P = .045)\n(Table 1). Mean CIDS scores at baseline were 89.3 (SD 6.64,\nrange 79.8 - 98.8) compared to 83.6 (SD 14.4, range 47.6 - 98.8)\npost-test (n = 12). However, this finding was due to one outlier\nin the post-test scores of this small sample (score of 47.6, more\nthan 2.5 standard deviations from the mean). If this outlying\ncase were excluded from the analysis, the CIDS score would\nnot be significantly different post-test (P = .08).\nJ Med Internet Res 2009 | vol. 11 | iss. 1 | e10 | p.5http:\/\/www.jmir.org\/2009\/1\/e10\/\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nJennings et alJOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH\nXSL\u2022FO\nRenderX\nTable 1.

One of the goals of\nthe pilot study was to establish that this intervention could\nsuccessfully recruit and retain participants. Of the 17 participants\nin the virtual clinic, 16 used the system throughout the study\nperiod, representing a retention rate of 94%.\nThe number of people using insulin pump therapy to manage\ntheir diabetes is growing rapidly. The United Kingdom has seen\na dramatic increase with the release of new guidelines in 2003\nby the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) [13].\nIndividual success with pump therapy requires ongoing\neducation, motivation, and psychological support [14], making\ninsulin pump users important and ideal candidates for\ninterventions of this nature.\nThe broad age range of the users in our study indicates the\nsystem has wide appeal. The fact that most users had been\ndiagnosed with diabetes for over 12 years may have some\nsignificance. It is likely that this group of users were well\npractised and had developed substantial expertise in\nself-management. Participants were regular Internet users and\nmost were highly educated.\nThere was a clear decline in use of the intervention over the 6\nmonths. This appears to be a distinct characteristic of\nInternet-based health interventions and may suggest that the\nsystem became less valuable to patients over time. Our usage\ndata follows a typical three-part process of non-usage [27].\nThere was an initial phase of high usage (months 1 and 2),\nrepresenting the novelty of the system; a second phase of gradual\ndecline (months 3 and 4), which may indicate that the system\ndoes not meet patient expectations or was no longer felt to be\nso relevant; and a third phase (months 5 and 6) where a stable\nuser group remained. However, participants reported that\nnon-usage was not due to dissatisfaction with the system but a\nreflection of the group\u2019s experience in self-management. It\nappeared that a major benefit of belonging to the community\nwas simply knowing that there was a resource available if and\nwhen it was needed. The small number of participants in the\npilot study may also have had a critical effect on the viability\nand sustainability of this virtual clinic. It is likely that a large\nand consistent number of active users are required to support a\nsystem such as this, particularly to sustain discussion forums.\nThe discussion forum was the most used, and reported as the\nmost useful, component of the virtual clinic system. This is in\nagreement with other interventions of this nature [10]. Taking\npart in peer discussions has shown to help patients with diabetes\ncope better with their illness [17] and improve adherence to\nmanagement, resulting in better metabolic control [28].\nParticipants who answered more questions than they posted\nJ Med Internet Res 2009 | vol. 11 | iss. 1 | e10 | p.6http:\/\/www.jmir.org\/2009\/1\/e10\/\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nJennings et alJOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH\nXSL\u2022FO\nRenderX\nfound taking part particularly encouraging. A live chat facility\nwas also available to participants but was not used. Users\nmentioned that they preferred using the asynchronous discussion\nboard as it was easier to follow and they could return to consult\nthe posts in their own time.\nAround one-third of the discussion forum posts related directly\nto issues regarding insulin pumps. These included books on\npumping, comfortable sites for positioning the pump, and\nremoving the pump for holidays. By having a site solely for\npump users, participants were able to share information and\nconcerns and seek advice from peers in similar situations. Future\ninterventions may consider restricting sites to specific groups,\nincluding, for example, newly diagnosed diabetics or teenagers\ntransitioning from pediatric to adult care, so participants can\nfully benefit from peer support elements.\nA number of \u201clurkers\u201d, people who read but seldom contributed\nto discussions, were identified in our intervention. Although\nthese users did not actively participate in discussions, many still\nfound them beneficial. Lurking has been described as a form\nof participation that is both acceptable and beneficial to online\ngroups because information supplied in health-related discussion\nforums is often used to seek better medical care, and the same\ninformation may provide the basis for other discussions in online\nor offline settings [29]. Furthermore, users in this intervention\nfelt that not contributing offered reassurance in confirming there\nwas nothing else they needed to know.\nParticipants often felt that involvement in the virtual clinic had\nnot improved their communication with their health care team.\nReasons for this included having no need to contact\nprofessionals during the intervention and concerns regarding\nuse of the Internet as a means of communication. Those who\ndid use the links suggested they would like to receive more of\ntheir routine medical care online. These findings contrast\nsomewhat with studies that suggest enhancing communication\nwith health professionals is a major benefit of Internet-based\nhealth care [12]. Participants in the current study had been\ndiagnosed with diabetes for a substantial period of time. It may\nbe that facilities to promote communication with health teams\nare more useful to those newly diagnosed because their needs\nare different from someone who has lived with the condition\nfor many years.\nThe pressure of this intervention on a clinician\u2019s time remains\nto be assessed. All health care professionals involved in the\nstudy were sent questionnaires asking how they spent their time.\nGenerally, these were not returned and highlight the need for\neffective measures to assess a clinician\u2019s time expenditure.\nOther studies have found email communication between patients\nand physicians does not adversely affect a physician\u2019s time [30].\nThe links to further information did not seem to be used as\nfrequently as the other two components. This may indicate that\nparticipants were already well informed about their condition.\nIt has been shown that people with diabetes who are highly\neducated and have Internet access at home are more likely to\nsearch the Web for health information [31].\nUsers\u2019 responses to the virtual clinic were very positive and\nprovide initial support for the proposal that this intervention\ncan aid self-management. However, there was no evidence in\nthis pilot study of improvements occurring in physiological and\npsychological measurements. This may be a result of the\nintervention\u2019s limited timeframe or insufficient usage by\nparticipants [32]. It could also be that participants appeared to\nhave had low information needs or that the study excluded those\nwho might benefit more, such as those new to the disease and\nthose new to pumping. Self-efficacy may have declined initially\nas patients realized that there was more about their condition\nto learn and understand than previously thought. It is also\npossible that participants\u2019 increased attention to the topic\nfocused their attention to the fact that diabetes is ultimately an\nincurable problem. Social and information support was\nobviously beneficial, but it was not a cure and may have\nincreased participants awareness of all that could \u201cgo wrong\u201d.\nIn addition, the current study\u2019s results revealed high HbA1c\nmeasurements with some users disclosing difficulties in\nmanaging their diabetes, despite experience of, and adherence\nto, self-management regimens. Poor metabolic control has been\nshown to reduce a patient\u2019s quality of life [33] and self-efficacy\n[34]. In addition, the CIDS scale may not have been the most\nappropriate instrument to use with insulin pump patients, since\nsome questionnaire content would not apply, such as performing\ninsulin injections.\nThere were several limitations to this study that would need to\nbe addressed in any future work. There were missing data as\nwe lost four participants to follow up and HbA1c results were\nonly available for eight users post-test. Furthermore, there\nappeared to be discrepancies between the qualitative and\nquantitative data findings. The positive tone of the interviews\nwas in contrast to the lack of improvements in self-efficacy and\nquality of life. This may have been due in part to not having\nfollow-up data for all participants and the small sample size in\nthis pilot study. Future work designed to draw conclusions\nbeyond feasibility and acceptability should incorporate a larger\nsample. Investigating other relevant outcomes, such as social\nsupport, may also be useful in future research.\nConclusion\nOverall this pilot study indicates that a virtual clinic intervention\nappears to be a feasible and acceptable way to provide patients\nwith the peer support and information necessary to aid\nself-management. However, no improvements in biological or\npsychological measures could be confirmed through the data.\nThis may be due to the complex problems this particular group\nof users faced in achieving good metabolic control, which may\nsubsequently affect their quality of life and self-efficacy. The\nfindings suggest a need for further refinement and testing of the\nintervention. They are being used to inform further development\nof Internet-based clinics and the design of larger-scale,\ncontrolled intervention studies.\n\u00a0\nJ Med Internet Res 2009 | vol. 11 | iss. 1 | e10 | p.7http:\/\/www.jmir.org\/2009\/1\/e10\/\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nJennings et alJOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH\nXSL\u2022FO\nRenderX\nConflicts of Interest\nNone declared.\nReferences\n1.
