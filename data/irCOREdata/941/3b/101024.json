Light emitting diodes operating under forward bias have been obtained by\ncodoping of boron to reduce the thermal quenching. Seven sharp lines are observed, corresponding\nto known internal Tm3+ transitions in the manifold from the 3H5 to the\n3H6 ground states. This\ncenter, together with the basic 1.15 \u0001m silicon emitters and Si:Er devices operating at 1.54 \u0001m,\nnow enables significant coverage of the extended \u00011.1\u20131.8 \u0001m\u0002 optical communications band in\nsilicon. \u00a9 2008 American Institute of Physics. \u0003DOI: 10.1063\/1.2916824\u0004\nThe incorporation of rare-earth \u0001RE\u0002 elements into III-V\nand silicon substrates is a promising contender for the devel-\nopment of optical sources. The RE partially filled inner 4f\nshell gives rise to sharp transitions, which are highly insen-\nsitive to the crystal host and temperature variations. For ex-\nample, light emission at 1.54 \u0001m, due to the incorporation of\nEr ions into III-V and Si substrates, were extensively inves-\ntigated and light emitting devices demonstrated.1,2 Another\nRE also known to function as an optical center is the element\nthulium \u0001Tm\u0002. Transitions between the trivalent Tm \u0001Tm3+\u0002\nlowest excited states and the ground state can lead to emis-\nsions around 0.8, 1.2, and 1.9 \u0001m.3 Here, we investigate the\nemission at wavelengths between 1.2 and 1.35 \u0001m, the re-\ngion of lowest dispersion in optical fibers and a required\nwavelength for several optical communication applications.\nLight emission in III-V semiconductors \u0001GaAs, GaInP,\nGaP, InP, and AlGaAs\u0002 incorporating Tm3+ has been previ-\nously reported.3\u20139 Photoluminescence \u0001PL\u0002 spectroscopy at\nlow temperatures was the main technique utilized to opti-\ncally characterize these materials. Luminescence was ob-\nserved around 0.8, 1.2, and 1.9 \u0001m and attributed to transi-\ntions between the lowest Tm3+ crystal-field-split spin-orbit\nlevels \u00013F4,\n3H5, and\n3H4\u0002 and the ground state \u0001\n3H6\u0002, respec-\ntively. For the 3H5\u2013\n3H6 transition, the main emission,\npresent in most of the samples, was located around\n1.233 \u0001m, although small line shifts between emissions from\ndifferent host crystals were also reported. Additional lines\nwere also observed near the 1.211, 1.255, 1.278, 1.298,\n1.312, and 1.326 \u0001m regions. The only report of Tm3+\nemission in crystalline silicon was by Pomrenke et al.3\n5\u00021013 Tm cm\u22122 at 390 keV was implanted into n- and\np-type Si substrates followed by annealing at 850 \u00b0C for\n15 min. Their PL measurements, performed at 6 K, showed a\nset of four relatively sharp but very weak lines, located in the\nregion of 1.2\u20131.35 \u0001m, superimposed on a very large broad\nbackground.\nThe dislocation engineered method in silicon was em-\nployed to fabricate efficient room temperature light emitting\ndiodes operating at around 1.1 \u0001m.10 In this approach, non-\nradiative recombination is minimized by the controlled intro-\nduction of dislocation loops to form energy barriers for car-\nrier diffusion. This provides spatial confinement of the\ninjected carriers, thus, enhancing the band-to-band recombi-\nnation. Light emission at other wavelengths can also be\nachieved by combining the standard dislocation engineering\ntechnique with the introduction of optical centers, operating\nat specific wavelengths, in the device active region. For ex-\nample, room temperature light emitting diodes operating at\n\u00051.5 \u0001m have been fabricated, using this approach, by in-\ncorporation of Er \u0001Refs. 11 and 12\u0002 and \u0003-FeSi2 \u0001Ref. 11\u0002\nbetween the depletion region edge and the dislocation loops\narray. In this letter, we report on the electroluminescence\n\u0001EL\u0002 of dislocation engineered light emitting devices incor-\nporating Tm ions in the active region.\nDislocation engineered light emitting devices doped with\nTm were fabricated by implanting 400 keV Tm ions, at four\ndifferent doses ranging from 1012 to 1015 Tm cm\u22122, into a\nn-type Si \u0003100\u0004 substrate \u00012\u20137 \u0004 cm\u0002 previously implanted\nwith 1015 B cm\u22122 at 30 keV. The boron implant, as well as\nproviding the p-type doping to form the p-n junction, also\nintroduced the dislocation loops. Samples were subsequently\nannealed in nitrogen ambient to electrically activate the dop-\nants. Annealing temperatures ranged from 750 to 950 \u00b0C,\nfor times up to 15 min.\nEL and PL measurements were carried out at 80 K to\ncharacterize the devices. The devices were mounted in a\ncontinuous-flow liquid nitrogen cryostat placed in front of a\nconventional half-meter spectrometer. A liquid nitrogen\ncooled germanium p-i-n diode was used for detection of the\nluminescence. The EL measurements were performed under\nforward bias \u0001current density of 1.25 A \/cm2\u0002 extracting the\nlight through a window at the back of the samples. The de-\nvice geometry is identical to those incorporating Er that were\npreviously reported.12 Current-voltage measurements were\nperformed on all devices prior to the EL experiments and\nstandard diode characteristics were observed with typical\nturn-on voltages of around 1 V. The PL experiments were\na\u0002Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. Electronic mail:\nm.lourenco.@surrey.ac.uk.

The\nEL intensity showed a strong dependence on the Tm im-\nplanted dose and postimplant annealing conditions. Figure 1\nshows the EL spectra from devices implanted at different\ndoses and annealed at 850 \u00b0C for 15 min. The EL emission\nis more pronounced in devices implanted at the lower doses,\nwith the sample implanted with 1013 Tm cm\u22122 giving the\nmaximum intensity. Seven clear emission lines can be ob-\nserved at 1211.5, 1231.0, 1250.8, 1269.3, 1288.8, 1311.3,\nand 1326.0 nm \u00011.024, 1.007, 0.991, 0.977, 0.962, 0.946, and\n0.935 eV, respectively\u0002 separated by around 16 meV. As the\nTm implanted dose increases, the intensity of these lines de-\ncreases, being almost absent for devices implanted at\n1015 Tm cm\u22122. This is attributed to increased implant dam-\nage or precipitation of excess Tm above the solubility limits\ndue to the higher doses.\nFigure 2 shows the dependence of the Tm transitions as\na function of annealing conditions\u2014time and temperature.\nFigure 2\u0001a\u0002 shows the EL measured from devices implanted\nwith 1013 Tm cm\u22122 and annealed at 850 \u00b0C for 1, 5, and\n15 min. Figure 2\u0001b\u0002 shows the EL from devices implanted at\nthe same dose but annealed at 750, 850, and 950 \u00b0C for\n15 min. The brightest EL is obtained after annealing at\n850 \u00b0C for 15 min. No Tm3+ related emissions are observed\nfrom devices annealed at 950 \u00b0C. Intensity of Tm3+ emis-\nsions falling off with increasing anneal temperature has been\nobserved in the GaAs:Tm system.3 It was suggested that re-\nsidual impurities in the substrate may become more mobile\nas the annealing temperature increases and form complexes\nwith the Tm3+, thus, reducing the concentration of optically\nactive Tm ions and quenching the luminescence.\nFigure 3 shows the PL spectra of samples implanted with\nTm, with and without boron induced dislocation loops. PL\nemission related to the Tm is only observed in the sample\ncodoped with boron. This shows that the B doping, to form\nan engineered dislocation loop array, is essential for obtain-\ning high efficiency, high temperature luminescence from the\nTm center, as was previously observed for the incorporation\nof Er in silicon.11,12 The EL spectrum of a similar diode is\nalso shown in Fig. 3. In the PL spectrum, eight lines are\nobserved, compared to seven in the EL, due to the splitting\nof the line at 1288.8 nm into a resolved doublet with lines at\n1283.9 and 1290.6 nm.\nTable I lists the positions of the Tm3+ related emission\nfrom our silicon samples as well as the emission peaks ob-\nFIG. 2.

Comparison of our results with\ndata from Ref. 3 shows that the four lines observed in their\nwork are reproduced here\u2014the slight discrepancy in line po-\nsition is the result of the poor signal to noise in the earlier\ndata, which were also superimposed on a much larger broad\nbackground. In our work, the silicon samples codoped with\nboron show additional lines, not previously observed in\nsilicon, at 1211.5, 1283.8, 1290.6, 1311.3, and 1326.0 nm.\nThese additional lines have all been reported in the PL of Tm\ndoped GaAs and AlGaAs, as can be seen by comparison to\nthe tabulated results, although some of the lines appear as\nresolved doublets in the lower temperature, higher reso-\nlution, GaAs and AlGaAs results.\nAs in the previous reports, we therefore attribute the\nobserved emission in our samples to the 4f-4f intracenter\ntransitions between the lowest Tm3+ crystal-field-split spin-\norbit levels \u00013H5\u0002 and the ground state \u0001\n3H6\u0002, which should\ngive a maximum of five transitions at low temperatures when\nonly the lowest of the 3H5 manifold states is occupied.\n4 The\nadditional lines, also observed in the GaAs and AlGaAs sys-\ntems, were attributed either to some distortion of the Tm3+\nion from the simple Td site to a site of lower symmetry or the\ncontribution of Tm3+ complexes. Given that Tm3+ complexes\nare unlikely to identically occur in silicon and GaAs, our\nresults support the first explanation of reduced Tm3+ site\nsymmetry.\nIn summary, we have shown that Tm implantation into\nsilicon can be used to provide both EL and PL emissions in\nthe 1.2\u20131.35 \u0001m region of the extended optical communica-\ntion band. The introduction of dislocation loops using B\ncoimplantation is paramount in obtaining high efficiency\nhigh temperature operation. We anticipate that further opti-\nmization of the process could lead to the elimination of the\nremaining thermal quenching and room temperature opera-\ntion, as was previously demonstrated in equivalent erbium\nbased devices.11,12\n1J.
