These methods may be\ndivided into two main groups depending on the parameters and data used\nin the analysis. The time-domain based analysis, which depends mainly on\nthe stress or strain amplitudes in the time history, has been well established\n(e.g. [1]-[3]) and widely accepted. In a time-domain approach, a cycle count-\ning procedure and, e.g. the rainflow algorithm [4]-[5], a cumulative damage\nrule are employed. The only difference with the non-vibration applications is\nthat random loading causes stress ranges of all magnitudes from zero to a set\nmaximum, which must be specified via probability density distributions and\nthe damage summation must be evaluated as an integral. However computer\nsimulation of all possible stress-time history samples is very time consuming\nand at the design stages the full stress history may not be available.\nOn the other front, the frequency domain analyses are now an accepted prac-\ntice [6]-[10]. These methodologies are based on expressing the fatigue life as a\nfunction of the spectral characteristics of the excitation. However, in spite of\nconsiderable efforts, no general analytical solution is yet available; damage ac-\ncumulation in frequency domain is currently described by approximated laws.\nMost of the existing techniques are limited to the stationary Gaussian loading\nhistories and there is no general agreement on how the effects of multi-axial\nloading on fatigue life can be accounted for.\nApart from random loading effects, many other random factors also influence\nfatigue damage accumulation, e.g. the randomness of material properties and\nrandomness of defect distribution in components. It is recognized that the\ncalculation of fatigue damage accumulation in absolute terms, i.e. life cycles,\nis still extremely difficult due to the randomness of the above factors. On the\nother hand, even for the simple constant or variable amplitude loading con-\nditions, large scatters exist in fatigue life prediction. This is mainly due to\nthe inherent limitation of the linear cumulative damage rule, i.e. the Miner\u2019s\nlaw, which is also widely employed in vibration fatigue analysis. Numerous\nstatistical studies and fatigue tests have been conducted to find the statistical\ndistribution of the damage [11].\n3\nThis paper is not about proposing another method for predicting fatigue life.\nRather, it aims at providing further insight into the inverse power scaling\nlaw models, which allow estimating the relative damage accumulation based\non laboratory tests. It is customary to perform accelerated random vibration\ntesting in a laboratory environment, which in terms of loading is considerably\nmore severe than the operative one; the operative life duration is then esti-\nmated by relating the structural fatigue life tested in the laboratory condition\nby a proper scaling factor. The scaling law depends on the ratio of the load\nseverities, e.g. using the root mean square values, of the two environments\nand also on some empirical or semi-empirical constants, which are determined\nfrom either the previous design or usage experience. A widely employed in-\nverse power law in the aerospace industry to correlate the laboratory tests to\nthe real service life is as follows [12]-[14]:\nTs\nTr\n=\n(\ngr\ngs\n)\u03b1\n(1)\nwhere Tr is the fatigue life in terms of time duration in an actual operative\nenvironment, Ts the fatigue life corresponding to accelerated laboratory test, gr\nand gs are the root mean square (RMS) values of the actual and lab simulated\naccelerations (or loads), respectively, applied to the structures. The exponent\n\u03b1 represents the slope of the material S-N curve in log-log coordinates. The\ninverse power scaling law in eq. (1) was derived from the Coffin-Manson\u2019s\nmodel of fatigue life [15]-[16]. It is worth stressing that eq. (1) is implemented in\nthe MIL Standard 810 [17], which specifies the lab testing environment for the\ncertification of military aerospace sub-systems in the US; this standard is also\ncommonly adopted by countries belonging to the NATO. Eq. (1) simply states\nthat the testing time in the laboratory environment is inversely proportional\nto the applied force RMS via exponent \u03b1. Although it has been recognised\nthat the exponent \u03b1 is the slope of the material S-N curve, the assumptions\nmade to derive eq. (1) are extremely reductive for the following reasons\n\u2022 Coffin-Manson\u2019s model [15] is strictly valid for a uni-axial applied force, i.e.\na simple tensile\/compressive stress, while eq. (1) is applied for the safe life\nestimation of complex structures, for which the operative loading and the\nresultant stress field may be multi-axial;\n\u2022 complex structures may be made of several different materials, each having\na characteristic sensitivity to fatigue damage accumulation;\n\u2022 there is no rigorous proof that the acceleration RMS are sufficient to fully\ndescribe the random vibration environment, especially for wide-band exci-\ntation spectra;\n4\n\u2022 under random loading the material S-N curve exponent is generally depen-\ndent on the spectral properties of the excitation [18]-[19]; standard fatigue\ntests on materials are performed with sinusoidal excitation, but the slope of\nthe S-N curve for an assigned material changes under random loading. The\nmethodology developed in this paper is based on considering the S-N curve\nunder random loading condition\nTherefore, in the light of the complexity of the phenomenon under investiga-\ntion, the very simple scaling law in eq. (1) represents a very crude approxi-\nmation of the fatigue behavior for complex structures, yet it is widely applied\nfor safe life analysis, at least at the design stage. The characteristic exponent\n\u03b1 usually ranges between 5 and 8, depending on the designer\u2019s background,\nprevious experiences and validation tests. Basically each company operating\nin the aerospace industry works with values adjusted to its own design and\ntesting database; this implies that very little of the original physical meaning\nof the \u03b1 exponent is retained in engineering applications. Actually the scaling\nexponent appears to be an empirical factor which weights all the uncertainties\nand limitations related to the \u201ctout-court\u201d application of eq. (1), regardless to\nits pristine interpretation as the material S-N curve slope. Ref. [13] and [17]\nrecommend that for eq. (1) to be valid the spectral response of the structure\nin the operative environment and the testing conditions must be \u201csimilar\u201d in\nshape; unfortunately no quantitative means are provided to identify whether\nthe recommended \u201csimilarity\u201d holds or not and what sort of effects this might\nhave on the \u03b1 values to be employed in accelerated testing.\nIn this paper a physically consistent scaling law is obtained by means of a\nrigorous approach within the framework of random vibration theory [20] and\nthe semi-empirical rules of the safe-life fatigue analysis; multi-axial wide-band\nloading is taken into account in the analysis. The objective is to provide a use-\nful tool to estimate the relative accumulation of fatigue damage under complex\nrandom loading conditions and discuss in detail under which assumptions eq.\n(1) can be considered as a valid approximation for practical purposes.\n2 Problem statement and basic assumptions\nThe derivation of a physically consistent scaling law for relative fatigue damage\naccumulation is based on the following assumptions\n\u2022 the materials are linear elastic;\n\u2022 no geometrical non-linearities arise (small strain elasticity);\n\u2022 multi-axial loads are applied to the structure in the form of random sta-\n5\ntionary Gaussian wide-band excitations;\n\u2022 a safe life approach based on S-N curves is used;\n\u2022 the von Mises equivalent stress can be used in standard material S-N curve\nin order to estimate the fatigue life duration due to multi-axial loading.\nIt is worth stressing that the von Mises equivalent stress mentioned in the last\npoint above does represent a spectral based extension of the familiar scalar\nstress measure commonly exploited in static analysis; this extended definition\nis discussed in detail in Sec. 3.3.\n3 Analysis methodology\nThe procedure to obtain the desired scaling laws starts from defining the\nspectral properties of the excitation and demonstrating that rainflow counting\nis not affected by the excitation level, provided that the input PSD shape stays\nthe same. Describing the structure by a finite set of discretized Lagrange\u2019s\nequations, the spectral properties of the stresses attained are then expressed\nas functions of those featuring the excitations. Then a spectral representation\nof the von Mises equivalent stress is introduced; this is needed to obtain a\nscalar stress measure from the general stress tensor in the case of multi-axial\nloading. An exact inverse power scaling law is obtained by substituting the\nspectral representation of the equivalent von Mises stress in the S-N curve\nequation, i.e. the Basquin\u2019s equation [21].\n3.1 Spectral properties of the excitation\nSince the applied load is random, the acceleration RMS provides a measure\nof the overall energy level associated to the vibration environment. In the\nframework of the random vibration theory, if the excitation is stationary, the\nRMS represents the square root of the acceleration PSD, so that\ngr =\n\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a +\u221e\u222b\n0\nSr(\u03bd) d\u03bd (2)\nwhere \u03bd is the frequency and Sr(\u03bd) is the one-sided acceleration PSD of the\nactual excitation. An equivalent definition holds for the simulated RMS of\nacceleration gs expressed by Ss(\u03bd). Therefore the problem of designing a test-\ning environment which resembles the actual operative one can be solved by\n6\nintroducing a scaling factor between the PSD functions representing the ac-\ntual acceleration Sr(\u03bd) and the simulated one Ss(\u03bd). This can be achieved by\nrelating the PSD to some statistical parameters.\nAssuming that the excitation is zero-mean valued, the p-th spectral moment\nis defined as follows\n\u03bb(r),p =\n+\u221e\u222b\n0\nSr(\u03bd)\u03bd\np d\u03bd (3)\nThe first order spectral moment \u03bb0 is simply the acceleration RMS squared.\nThe average number of zero-crossings N(r),0 with positive slope per unit time\nfeaturing the actual load is given by\nN(r),0 =\n\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a\u03bb(r),2\n\u03bb(r),0\n(4)\nand the average number N(r),p of peaks per unit time is defined as:\nN(r),p =\n\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a\u03bb(r),4\n\u03bb(r),2\n(5)\nThe bandwidth parameter is defined as the ratio of number of crossings to\nnumber of peaks per unit time\n\u03be =\nN(r),0\nN(r),p\n(6)\nIf the actual and the experimental PSDs are related by the simple scaling\nrelation\nSs(\u03bd) = KsrSr(\u03bd) (7)\nwhere Ksr > 1 is a constant, all the spectral moments from eq. (3) are scaled\nby Ksr and the average numbers of zero-crossings and peaks per unit time, as\nwell as the bandwidth parameter, do not change.\n3.2 Rainflow counting for random loading\nThe above result has important implications in terms of cycle counting by\nthe rainflow method; it is well known that the rainflow algorithm, even in its\n7\nnon-recursive formulation, does not allow to obtain closed form solutions for\nthe cumulative distributions of cycle amplitude and mean values.\nLet g\u00af\u2217i and g\u02c6\n\u2217\nj be of the non-dimensional mean acceleration g\u00af\n\u2217 = g\u00af\/g and non-\ndimensional acceleration amplitude g\u02c6\u2217 = g\u02c6\/g as obtained by rainflow counting\nfrom a random acceleration history having PSD S(\u03bd) and RMS g. Each of\nthe partitions comprises M levels. For a detailed discussion of accurate and\nefficient rainflow counting methodologies the reader is referred to [5].\nLet \u03a3RF be the rainflow matrix obtained by the acceleration cycle counting;\neach entry (i, j) of the matrix is given by\n\u03a3RFi,j =\nni,j\nN\n(8)\nwhere ni,j represents the number of cycles whose mean value and amplitude\nsatisfy\ng\u00af\u2217 \u2208 [g\u00af\u2217i\u22121, g\u00af\u2217i ) \u2229 g\u02c6\u2217 \u2208 [g\u02c6\u2217j\u22121, g\u02c6\u2217j ) (9)\nand N is the total number of cycles counted. It is clear that for N \u2192\u221e each\nentry (i, j) of the rainflow matrix represents the probability of finding in the\nload history acceleration cycles with mean value and amplitude satisfying (9).\nIn standard practise the rainflow ranges are not normalized by the acceler-\nation RMS, but employing the non-dimensional mean value and amplitude\nguarantees that the rainflow matrix is invariant with respect to the scaling\n(7) of the original PSD function. This can be proved by observing that a time\nhistory having a PSD S(\u03bd) can be converted to a time history having the PSD\nKS(\u03bd), where K is a positive constant, by multiplying all the g values by\n\u221a\nK.\nIf g is the root mean square of the pristine time history, g\n\u221a\nK would be the\nroot mean square of the modified one. This does not affect the number of zero-\ncrossings and peaks as well as the sequence of turning points that represents\nthe input for the rainflow counting; the cycles mean values and amplitude will\nbe all multiplied by\n\u221a\nK for the modified time history, so this would not affect\nthe rainflow matrix \u03a3RF .\nTherefore the conclusion is that for stationary Gaussian stochastic processes\nwhich have PSD functions with the same shape, i.e. the PSD of the different\nprocess can be obtained by a proper scale factor K > 0, the rainflow matrix is\nthe same, provided that the mean value and amplitude levels are normalized\nby the root mean square value of the time history, i.e. the zero order spec-\ntral moment of the various PSD functions. The result just obtained is valid\nfor a uni-axial random loading; in multi-axial loading condition it has been\nrecognised that the damage accumulation in metals is essentially shear driven\n[22]. Small cracks can nucleate and growth on a \u201ccritical\u201d plane where the\nmaximum shear strain is attained; therefore the multi-axial damage assess-\nment can be reduced to an uni-axial equivalent problem. Nevertheless normal\nstresses and shear strains can occur out of phase [23] and this makes cycle\n8\ncounting more difficult; moreover the orientation of the critical plane is gener-\nally unknown so, even if a proper counting algorithm is available, the damage\nassessment procedure must be repeated for several candidate critical orien-\ntations. Improved multi-axial cycle counting algorithms have been proposed\n[23]-[24] in order to cope with the effects mentioned above. In this paper the\ncritical plane cycle counting is not considered because a scalar stress measure\nis introduced via a spectral representation of the von Mises stress; this allows\nreducing the multi-axial cycle counting to the much simpler random uni-axial\nscenario discussed above.\n3.3 Derivation of equivalent stress spectrum\nThe main problem in applying eq. (1) to assembled structures is relating the\nlocal stress\/strain state in each component to the external acceleration spec-\ntrum. This task requires a complete model of the structure. Assuming that\nthis model is somehow available, for example in a discrete form, the PSD of\nthe local stress\/strain field can then be obtained from the acceleration and the\nnatural vibration modes of the assembled structure; it is here assumed that\nthe structure is discretized by applying the FE method. Let the dynamics\nof the structure be represented by the following n-degrees of freedom second\norder system\nMx\u00a8(t) +Cx\u02d9(t) +Kx(t) = F (t) (10)\nwhere x(t) is the vector of nodal displacements, i.e. the degrees of freedom, M\nis the mass matrix, C the damping matrix, K the stiffness matrix and F (t) the\nvector of external force applied. It is here assumed that the dynamic analysis\nof the system is performed by the well-established large mass technique [25];\nthis method is based on placing a \u201cseismic\u201d mass, whose magnitude is much\nlarger than that featuring the structure, at the discretization nodes for which\nknown accelerations are prescribed. Large mass elements act effectively as\nconstraints for the structural nodes, enforcing the motion prescribed by the\nuser; this method is the simulation counterpart of experimental vibration tests\nperformed by shakers. The large mass approach is suitable for both harmonic,\ntransient and random response analyses. The FE analysis of structural random\nvibration in the framework of linear elasticity and small strain assumption\nallows expressing the stress response PSD matrix S(e)\u03c3\u03c3(\u03bd) as a function of the\ninput acceleration PSD matrix Saa(\u03bd) via the following equation\nS(e)\u03c3\u03c3(\u03bd) = D\n(e)(x, y, z)U(\u03bd)GSaa(\u03bd)G\nT (11)\nThe superscript (e) in eq. (11) denotes any arbitrary element belonging the the\nbody\/structure discretization; the matrix D(e)(x, y, z) contains the elemental\n9\nmaterial properties and shape functions employed in the discretization. The\nmatrix U(\u03bd) comprises the harmonic response of the structural degrees of\nfreedom. Finally the matrix G converts the seismic mass accelerations to the\nnodal loads on the right hand side of eq. (10). The details of eq. (11) derivation\nare presented in Appendix A for sake of completeness.\nThe problem now is how to relate eq. (11) to the fatigue damage accumulation.\nThe strain-stress field is multi-axial, so the conventional uni-axial fatigue data\ncannot be applied directly, unless the structural configuration is extremely\nsimple. Secondly for a multi-axial stress\/strain history it is also necessary to\napply a modified rainflow counting algorithm, basically taking into account\nall the possible linear combination of the stress\/strain history components for\na discrete set of geometrical points belonging to the structure. These latter\ncan be either the FE mesh nodes or a suitable set of collocation points chosen\nwithin the elements or both these things. It is clearly understood that generat-\ning random stress histories with proper auto and cross-correlation properties,\ncombining them, rainflow counting for a discrete set of collocation points and\nfinally evaluating the damage by a multi-axial fatigue accumulation criterion\nwould require a tremendous amount of computational time; this happens even\nfor relatively simple configurations. Moreover several multi-axial fatigue crite-\nria have been proposed and choosing the right one for the specific application\nis not easy. However it must be pointed out that the main aim here is to estab-\nlish proper scaling factors between laboratory tests and the actual operative\nenvironment. So the requirement for the multi-axial fatigue criterion is not to\nbe accurate in absolute terms, but only to provide a consistent representation\nin the physics of fatigue damage accumulation in order to compare the effects\nof different excitation histories.\nSeveral multi-axial fatigue accumulation models for metals are based on the\nvon Mises stress concept [26]-[27]; this approach is appealing since a multi-axial\nstress state can be converted to an equivalent uni-axial one and the standard\nsafe life calculations can be performed by entering the S-N curves with the von\nMises equivalent stress. Multi-axial versions of the Goodman equivalent stress\namplitude have been expressed in terms of the hydrostatic stress components.\nLow cycle fatigue models have been developed by considering the von Mises\nequivalent strain and hydrostatic stresses in order to model the mean value\neffect.\nThe von Mises equivalent stress is defined as follows\n\u03c32eq = \u03c3\n2\nx + \u03c3\n2\ny + \u03c3\n2\nz \u2212 \u03c3x\u03c3y \u2212 \u03c3x\u03c3z \u2212 \u03c3y\u03c3z + 3\u03c4 2xy + 3\u03c4 2xz + 3\u03c4 2yz (12)\nFrom Ref. [27], introducing the S matrix, the von Mises stress can be expressed\nin the following equivalent form\n\u03c32eq = Tr\n[\nS\u03c3\u03c3T\n]\n(13)\n10\nwhere Tr is the trace operator and S is given by\nS =\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n1 \u22121\n2\n\u22121\n2\n0 0 0\n\u22121\n2\n1 \u22121\n2\n0 0 0\n\u22121\n2\n\u22121\n2\n1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n(14)\nThe main problem in applying the von Mises equivalent stress to the random\nvibration fatigue damage is that, for a stationary Gaussian stress history, \u03c3eq\nis not normally distributed; this implies that the von Mises stress distribution\nshould be obtained by a direct time-domain Monte Carlo simulation, which\nis very demanding from a computational point of view. The definition (13)\nallows overcoming this problem; taking the expectation of both sides of (13)\nyields\nE\n[\n\u03c32eq\n]\n= Tr [SC\u03c3\u03c3] (15)\nwhere C\u03c3\u03c3 = E\n[\n\u03c3\u03c3T\n]\nis the covariance matrix of the stress vector. Now, since\nthe PSD is the Fourier transform of the correlation function, for each element\ne of the structural FE mesh the stress covariance matrix can be obtained as\nC(e)\u03c3\u03c3 =\n+\u221e\u222b\n0\nS(e)\u03c3\u03c3(\u03bd)d\u03bd (16)\nwhere the argument of the integral is given by (11). Thus from (15) one obtains\n(\nE\n[\n\u03c32eq\n])(e)\n= Tr\n\uf8ee\uf8f0S +\u221e\u222b\n0\nS(e)\u03c3\u03c3(\u03bd)d\u03bd\n\uf8f9\uf8fb (17)\nFollowing Ref. [27], one can postulate that there exists a von Mises equivalent\nstress whose mean quadratic value in expressed as the integral of the associated\npower spectral density function over the whole frequency range as follows\n(\nE\n[\n\u03c32eq\n])(e)\n=\n+\u221e\u222b\n0\nS(e)\u03c3eq\u03c3eq(\u03bd)d\u03bd (18)\n11\nComparing eqs. 17 and 18 one can define the equivalent Von Mises stress as\nthe stochastic process whose PSD function is given by\nS(e)\u03c3eq\u03c3eq(\u03bd) = Tr\n[\nSS(e)\u03c3\u03c3(\u03bd)\n]\n(19)\nThe definition in eq. (19) shows that the equivalent von Mises stress is a sta-\ntionary Gaussian process whose spectral representation is obtained directly\nfrom that worked out for the cross-PSD of the stress components [27]. This\nresult establishes a direct link between the accelerations applied to the struc-\nture and the von Mises stress levels attained in each element e. If the excitation\nhas zero mean value, then the von Mises stress also has the same property; in\nthe case of a one-dimensional problem the von Mises stress yields simply the\nonly stress component featuring the structural response.\nBy introducing the spectral definition of the von Mises stress (18) there is no\nmore necessity of simulating the stress histories for each stress tensor com-\nponent; these simulations can now be performed directly by generating a von\nMises stress history having the PSD (19), which is immediately related to the\noutput (11) of a random vibration FE analysis. Moreover there is no need\nfor multi-axial rainflow counting, since the three-dimensional problem is now\nrepresented by a one-dimensional variable, that is the von Mises stress; the\ncounting procedure can be applied directly to \u03c3eq for each element.\n3.4 General Scaling law\nThe random vibration response of a continuous complex structure has been re-\nduced to that featuring the discrete system which can be obtained by applying\nthe FE method. The von Mises stress has been chosen as the representative\nvariable ruling the damage accumulation in a three-dimensional stress state,\nthus leading to a one-dimensional of fatigue life assessment. the fatigue life of\nall the materials employed in the structure can be predicted by a S-N curve\nbased safe-life approach. The choice of the statistical parameters by which the\nrandom fatigue experimental data can be expressed is not trivial; the basic S-\nN curves for deterministic constant amplitude loading are presented as stress\namplitude versus the number of cycles. For a random load history the number\nof cycles cannot be identified \u201ca priori\u201d, but it must be counted by the rain-\nflow algorithm. Both the number of zero-crossings with positive slope and the\nnumber of peaks provide indirect measures of the total number of cycles to\nwhich the tested specimens undergo, but the bandwidth parameter also has a\nconsiderable influence on the accumulated damage.\nFrom a qualitative point of view this can be understood by observing that,\nfor a narrow-band stress history, the number of peaks is close to that of zero-\ncrossings, so the cycle measure tends to be unique; on the other hand for a\n12\nwide band process the numbers of zero crossings and peaks differ consider-\nably, being the former much less than the latter. A wide-band load history\nis expected to produce more\u201crainflow\u201d fatigue cycles than zero-crossings with\npositive slope, because the stress values tends to be clustered in sequences\nhaving a non-zero mean value; therefore for each zero-crossing there is a cer-\ntain number of peaks and troughs, some of which identify hysteretic loops for\nthe material, i.e. fatigue cycles according to the rainflow algorithm.\nKeeping these differences in mind, it is here stated to measure the fatigue life\nduration by the total number of crossings with positive slope; therefore the S-\nN curves can be expressed in terms of the root mean square value \u03c3\u02dc of the von\nMises \u03c3eq stress featuring a random load history, versus the total number of\nzero crossing with positive slope N\u02dc0. Thus the fatigue strength in multi-axial\nfatigue accumulation can be expressed by a Basquin\u2019s type equation [21]\n\u03c3\u02dc = CN\u02dc\n\u22121\/b\n0 (20)\nThe assumption that the stress measure is represented by the RMS of the load\nhistory is useful because an RMS value can be also introduced for deterministic\nload histories. For example the RMS of a sinusoidal signal is its amplitude\ndivided by\n\u221a\n2; for a sawtooth signal the scaling factor is\n\u221a\n3; finally for a\nsquare wave signal the amplitude and RMS are exactly the same.\nNote that this S-N curve in eq. 20 is not necessary that obtained by sinusoidal\nloading with constant amplitude; the effects of load interactions which occurs\nin a random stress history increase the S-N curve slope with respect to the\nsinusoidal load case [30]. Anyway the specific PSD shape parameters do not\nappear in (20). This means that (20) is assumed to be valid for both narrow-\nband and wide-band processes; this point will be discussed more in detail later\non.\nThe root mean square value of the von Mises stress for each element is obtained\nby taking the square root of both eq. (17) members, yielding\n\u03c3\u02dc(e) =\n\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221aTr\n\uf8ee\uf8f0S +\u221e\u222b\n0\nS\n(e)\n\u03c3\u03c3(\u03bd)d\u03bd\n\uf8f9\uf8fb (21)\nAgain (21) is directly linked to the stress cross-PSD (A.17). Assuming to\nconsider the actual operative vibration environment (r) and the simulated\nlaboratory one (s) the ratio of the fatigue durations in terms of crossings with\npositive slope is obtained by (20) as\nN\u02dc\n(e)\n0,(s)\nN\u02dc\n(e)\n0,(r)\n=\n\uf8eb\uf8ed \u03c3\u02dc(e)(r)\n\u03c3\u02dc\n(e)\n(s)\n\uf8f6\uf8f8b\n(e)\n(22)\n13\nwhere b(e) is the exponent of Basquin\u2019s equation [i.e. eq. (20)] for the material\nthe element is made of.\nIf T\u02dc(r) = N\u02dc0,(r)\/N0,(r) is the actual time to failure and T\u02dc(s) = N\u02dc0,(s)\/N0,(s) is the\nlaboratory time to failure, eq. (22) leads to\nT\u02dc\n(e)\n(s)\nT\u02dc\n(e)\n(r)\n=\nN\n(e)\n0,(r)\nN\n(e)\n0,(s)\n\uf8eb\uf8ed \u03c3\u02dc(e)(r)\n\u03c3\u02dc\n(e)\n(s)\n\uf8f6\uf8f8b\n(e)\n(23)\nExploiting (4) one can write\nN\n(e)\n0,(r)\nN\n(e)\n0,(s)\n=\n\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a\u03bb(e)(r),2\u03bb(e)(s),0\n\u03bb\n(e)\n(s),2\u03bb\n(e)\n(r),0\n(24)\nwhere the spectral moments \u03bb(r),p and \u03bb(s),p are given by (3) and they are\nreferred to the equivalent von Mises stress for the e-th element. Since the\nsquare root of the zero-th order spectral moment is simply the root mean\nsquare value of the stochastic process, substituting (24) into (23) yields\nT\u02dc\n(e)\n(s)\nT\u02dc\n(e)\n(r)\n=\n\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a\u03bb(e)(r),2\n\u03bb\n(e)\n(s),2\n\uf8eb\uf8ed \u03c3\u02dc(e)(r)\n\u03c3\u02dc\n(e)\n(s)\n\uf8f6\uf8f8b\n(e)\u22121\n(25)\nFinally substituting eqs. (21) and (3) in the last equation yields\nT\u02dc\n(e)\n(s)\nT\u02dc\n(e)\n(r)\n=\n\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221aTr\n[\nS\n\u222b+\u221e\n0 S\n(e)\n\u03c3\u03c3,r(\u03bd)\u03bd2d\u03bd\n]\nTr\n[\nS\n\u222b+\u221e\n0 S\n(e)\n\u03c3\u03c3,s(\u03bd)\u03bd2d\u03bd\n]\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\uf8f3Tr\n[\nS\n\u222b+\u221e\n0 S\n(e)\n\u03c3\u03c3,r(\u03bd)d\u03bd\n]\nTr\n[\nS\n\u222b+\u221e\n0 S\n(e)\n\u03c3\u03c3,s(\u03bd)d\u03bd\n]\n\uf8fc\uf8fd\uf8fe\nb(e)\u22121\n2\n(26)\nEq. (26) gives the exact time scale for an arbitrary linear elastic structure sub-\njected to a stationary Gaussian excitation; the cross-PSD of the local stress\nfield for both the operative and simulated environments is given by (11). Since\nthe equivalent von Mises stress has been employed to predict the fatigue dam-\nage according to the Basquin\u2019s type equation (20), the applicability of (26)\nis restricted only to metallic structures. Other class of materials will require\nintroducing different damage indexes; the procedure here outlined is general,\nprovided that those alternative damage indexes admit a spectral representa-\ntion similar to that employed for the von Mises stress. For example it can be\neasily demonstrated that standard failure criteria for composite materials (i.e.\nTsai-Hill, Tsai-Wu, Hoffman, etc.) admit a spectral representation analogous\nto that in eq. (18).\nThe scaling law (26) is valid for all the elements comprised in the FE model\n14\nof the complete structure; the proper scaling time can be evaluated by the\nelements which under the prescribed vibration environment are subjected to\nthe largest von Mises stress RMS and which are the most susceptible to accu-\nmulate fatigue damage.\n3.5 Simplification of the general scaling law\nA fundamental question arises at this point: how does (26) relate to the em-\npirical scaling law in eq. (1)? In order to answer to this question the following\nassumptions are introduced:\n1. the structure for laboratory testing is identical to that in operative con-\nditions;\n2. the constraints applied in the testing configuration and in the operative\nenvironment are exactly the same;\n3. the cross-PSD of the accelerations applied to the testing structure are simply\nscaled with respect to the actual operative ones, i.e.\nSaa,(s)(\u03bd) = KsrSaa,(r)(\u03bd) (27)\nwhere Ksr > 1 in order to accelerate the laboratory trials.\nUnder these assumptions, exploiting (27) and (11) one can write\nS\n(e)\n\u03c3\u03c3,(s)(\u03bd) = KsrS\n(e)\n\u03c3\u03c3,(r)(\u03bd) (28)\nTherefore the stress cross-PSD for the e-th element in the simulated lab vi-\nbration environment are simply scaled by the factor Krs with respect to the\noperative ones. Thus substituting (28) into (26) yields\nT\u02dc\n(e)\n(s)\nT\u02dc\n(e)\n(r)\n=\n(\n1\nKsr\n)b(e)\/2\n(29)\nThe scale factor Ksr must be a scalar, i.e it must be the same for all the\ncross-PSD, otherwise eq. (29) will not be applicable. If the excitation is one-\ndimensional, (27) reduces to\nSaa,(s)(\u03bd) = KsrSaa,(r)(\u03bd) (30)\n15\nwhere Sa,(r) and Sa,(s) are now scalar functions representing the auto-PSD of\nthe only external excitation applied. Taking the integral over the real positive\naxis of both members of the last equation yields\ng2(s) = Ksrg\n2\n(r) (31)\nwhere g(s) and g(r) are the RMS of the simulated and actual one-dimensional\naccelerations. Substituting (31) into (29) leads to\nT\u02dc\n(e)\n(s)\nT\u02dc\n(e)\n(r)\n=\n(\ng(r)\ng(s)\n)b(e)\n(32)\nTherefore eq. (32) demonstrates that the commonly adopted inverse power\nscaling law (1) is just a particular case of the exact expression in eq. (26). The\nsimplification here demonstrated is valid only under the assumptions listed\nabove in the case of multi-axial loading. The critical point is that (1) is strictly\nvalid for arbitrary structural configuration only if the excitation PSD shape is\nthe same passing from the testing environment to the operative one; moreover,\nstrictly speaking, the structural geometrical configurations must be identical,\nas well as the constraints applied. Any violation of the assumptions made will\nforce to employ eq. (26) in order to get the correct time scaling.\nNevertheless, if the general scaling law from eq. (26) is applied, particular\ncare must be taken to avoiding substantial changes of the geometry\/constraint\nlayout; for example by removing constraints it is possible to make spurious\nvibration modes appear, so that the estimation of the scaling factors will be\ntoo conservative. On the other hand, if additional constrains are added in the\ntesting environment, some vibration modes featuring the operative scenario\nwill be suppressed and the actual scaling factor underestimated.\n4 S-N curves in a random vibration environment\nIn the above sections it has been demonstrated how an exact scaling law, i.e.\neq. (26), for accelerated fatigue testing can be obtained in the framework of\nrandom vibration theory, assuming that the relative damage accumulation due\nto multi-axial load can be quantified by the equivalent von Mises stress. In the\nspecial case where the testing input spectra and the operative ones have the\nsame shape, the exact expression can be simplified, leading to eq. (32), which\nis identical to the widely employed inverse power law from eq. (1). It is also\nrecognised that the characteristic exponent \u03b1 is the material S-N curve slope\nin a log-log representation of the fatigue life versus the applied stress RMS.\nThe key point at this stage is to understand how to estimate b(e) for either the\n16\nexact or the simplified scaling laws; the basic issue is that the S-N curve expo-\nnent as obtained from standard constant amplitude fatigue tests on materials\nis not directly applicable to eqs. (26) and (32). This is due to the fact that ran-\ndom load histories are deeply affected by load interaction and sequence effect;\nthe impact of those effects in reducing the actual fatigue life for variable am-\nplitude loading is well documented in literature [28]. It has been demonstrated\n[29]-[30] that load interaction effect for variable amplitude stress histories can\nbe accounted for by a clockwise rotation of the S-N curves in the stress-cycle\nplane. This implies that the S-N curve slope for variable amplitude loading\nmust be increased with respect to constant amplitude conditions, yielding a\nshorter fatigue life for the same average stress amplitude.\nTo prove this point one can refer to a detailed survey of random fatigue accu-\nmulation in the aluminium alloy 2024-T4 [18]. This experimental survey was\nintended to find the effect of random load on the damage accumulation for\nthe aforementioned alloy.\nSix different PSD shapes were considered, having the general form\nS\u03c3\u03c3\nKi\n= Ai\u03bd\n\u03b2 (33)\nwhere \u03c3 is the uni-axial stress applied, \u03bd the frequency, Ai and \u03b2 are shape\nparameters; Ki is a further set of constants which were used to tailor the\noverall RMS value of the applied stress. A summary of the PSD function\nproperties used during the laboratory tests is presented in tab. 1, where N0\nis the average number of zero-crossing with positive slope per unit time, Np\nthe average number of peaks per unit time and \u03be is the bandwidth parameter.\nIn all the tests the underlying stochastic process was Gaussian distributed\nwith zero mean value. The RMS of the load history have been varied together\nwith the basic PSD shapes. These latter fell in three different types, grouped\naccording to their specific frequency dependence, as summarized in tab. 1; the\nPSD belonging to each type can be further distinguished by their bandwidth.\nA summary of the S-N data presented in [18] is shown in fig. (1). In this\nfigure the RMS of the applied stress to failure is plotted versus the total\nnumber of zero crossing with positive slope; all the data from the random load\nhistories have been grouped together and fitted by a single trend-line. The first\nobservation is that, despite the different bandwidths of the stress histories,\nall the random fatigue data are well approximated by a single S-N curve.\nThis latter appears to be shifted and rotated clockwise with respect to that\nfeaturing the sinusoidal load condition, thus resulting in a faster accumulation\nof fatigue damage under the random stress histories; however the net effect\nof different PSD shapes appears to be negligible. Considering that the band-\nwidth parameter for the six different PSD here considered ranges between\n0.5 and 0.9, the data in fig. (1) suggest that the damage accumulation in\nrandom fatigue depends only on the stress RMS and number of zero-crossings\nwith positive slope. This conclusion is quite intriguing, since it suggests that\n17\nfor a random loading environment there is a unique S-N curve featuring the\nfatigue damage accumulation, which depends essentially on the material; the\nstatistical information needed to plot the characteristic random S-N curve are\nthe stress RMS and the total number of zero-crossings with positive slope.\nCare must be taken in applying the previous conclusion to metallic alloys\nin general; the data available have been obtained for a specific aluminium\nalloy, namely Al 2024-T4. In Ref. [31] the fatigue accumulation in steel joints\nunder wide-band excitation was considered; both Gaussian and non-Gaussian\nrandom loads were employed, with unimodal and bimodal spectra. It was\ndemonstrated that non-Gaussian load histories accelerate the fatigue damage\naccumulation, so the S-N curve slope is dependent on the probability density\nfunction featuring the stochastic process which represents the applied load.\nNevertheless, considering the case of Gaussian loading, the authors point out\nthat increasing the bandwidth parameter has a limited effect on the fatigue\nlife estimated in terms of number of zero-crossings with positive slope; this\nis due to the fact that, in wide-band processes, the peaks tend to correspond\nto small amplitude cycles which have a limited impact on the accumulated\ndamage. Therefore the results in Ref. [31] support the conclusion that the S-N\ncurves obtained for various bandwidth parameters in the case of a Gaussian\nexcitation are close enough to be superposed, as already pointed out by the\ndata from [18]; a definitive proof of this conclusion should be obtained by\nplotting the S-N curves as a function of the number of zero crossings with\npositive slope, whereas in Ref. [31] the number of rainflow cycles is considered.\nSimilar remarks are also valid for the experimental tests performed in Ref. [32]\non steel structures under random loading.\nAll the experimental results discussed above clearly point out that the fatigue\nexponent b(e) changes sharply passing from constant amplitude loading to\nrandom stress histories; therefore a correct scaling factor between a laboratory\nenvironment and the actual operative conditions can be established only if\nrandom fatigue data in a standard S-N format are available for the structural\nmaterial. The fact that b(e) appears to be not affected by the spectral properties\nof the random excitation could reduce the number of experimental tests to be\ncarried out, but the physical consistency of this result for different structural\nmaterials must still be demonstrated.\n5 Conclusions\nThe certification of aerospace structures in random vibration environments\nis based on accelerated fatigue testing. Scaling laws are needed to relate the\ntest time in a laboratory environment to the actual operative life duration.\nCurrent certification methodologies are based on inverse power laws obtained\nfrom classical fatigue models, which are strictly valid only for constant ampli-\n18\ntude uni-axial loading.\nAn exact scaling law has been obtained in the framework of classical random\nvibration theory and safe-life design methodologies; this scaling rule allows\ncomparing the relative damage accumulation in vibration environments whose\ncharacteristic input spectra can be different, but the underlying probability\ndistribution must be Gaussian. The exact scaling law has been obtained by\nassuming that the relative damage caused by multi-axial loading can be quan-\ntified by a scalar stress measure, namely the equivalent von Mises stress.\nIn the special case where the input PSD shapes featuring the testing environ-\nment and the operative one have the same shape, i.e. the input spectra are\nsimply scaled by a constant factor, the general scaling rule is simplified to the\nsemi-empirical inverse power law which is prescribed by the current certifica-\ntion standards.\nThe scaling law exponent which appears in both the exact and simplified\nscaling rules is that featuring the material S-N curve; this had already been\ndemonstrated for uni-axial loading cases, but the result has here been ex-\ntended to the case of random multi-axial loading.\nNevertheless it must be considered that the material S-N curve obtained from\na random stress history differs from that worked out employing a constant\namplitude load. Generally speaking the fatigue accumulation in a random vi-\nbration environment is quicker than for constant amplitude loading, i.e. the\nS-N curve slope is larger in the case of random loading. This implies that\nthe correct value of the exponent which appears in the inverse power scaling\nlaw should be estimated by random fatigue tests on representative material\nsamples. If the S-N curve characterising the fatigue damage accumulation un-\nder random loading is expressed as stress amplitude RMS versus number of\nzero crossings, some literature data actually suggest that the change in the\nS-N curve slope is only a weak function of the bandwidth featuring the stress\nhistory. The aforementioned data were obtained for an aluminium alloy sub-\njected to Gaussian load histories with different PSD shapes. This would imply\nthat a correct scaling exponent can be obtained by only a limited amount of\nrandom fatigue tests, without the need of investigating the effects of several\nbandwidth values. More experimental data are needed to support this still\nvery limited experimental evidence.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors are grateful to the UK Ministry of Defence for supporting this\nproject under the research programme \u201cWhole Life Assessment\u201d.

Both B(e)(x, y, z) and \u03b4(e) depend on the kind of el-\nement considered and the shape functions employed. Of course m(e) as well as\nB(e)(x, y, z) may vary from element to element depending on the local mesh\ntopology. Similarly for the stress field the following equation holds\n\u03c3(e) = C\u02c6(e)B(e)(x, y, z)\u03b4(e) (A.6)\n24\nwhere C\u02c6(e) is the (6 \u00d7 6) constitutive tensor for the material the element\nis made of. Let A(e) be a matrix which extracts from the global vector of\ndisplacements only those featuring the element (e); A(e) is a (m(e)\u00d7n) matrix,\nsince the element are supposed to have m(e) nodal parameters and the whole\nmodel has n degrees of freedom. The extraction matrix has either zero or unit\nentries. The e-th element displacement\/rotations are obtained as\n\u03b4(e) = A(e)x (A.7)\nTherefore the elemental strains and stresses can be expressed as\n\u000f(e) = B(e)(x, y, z)A(e)x (A.8)\n\u03c3(e) = C\u02c6(e)B(e)(x, y, z)A(e)x (A.9)\nEmploying the last equation it is easy to show that the cross-PSD of the stress\ncomponents within an element e is given by\nS(e)\u03c3i\u03c3m(\u03bd) =\nn\u2211\nl=1\nn\u2211\nq=1\nD\n(e)\nilmqSxlxq(\u03bd) (A.10)\nwhere\nD\n(e)\nilmq =\nn\u2211\nj=1\nn\u2211\nk=1\nn\u2211\nn=1\nn\u2211\np=1\nC\u02c6\n(e)\nij C\u02c6\n(e)\nmnB\n(e)\njk B\n(e)\nnpA\n(e)\nkl A\n(e)\npq (A.11)\nis a matrix which depends on the spatial coordinates (x, y, z). Therefore the\ncross-PSD of the elemental stress (A.10) can be obtained from that of the\ndegrees of freedom (A.1) representing the discretized structure.\nThe theory of random vibration here summarized allows describing the struc-\ntural response to distributed external forces; however the specific problem un-\nder investigation requires estimating the response of the structure to uniform\ntranslational\/rotational accelerations. This can be done by assuming a rigid\nconnection of the structure to a seismic mass, i.e. a relatively large mass ele-\nment to which the accelerations are applied. Thus the motion of the structure\nfollows that of the seismic mass and the displacements, strains and stresses\nare expressed in a rigid reference frame attached to the seismic mass and\nto the structure. Therefore the force inputs to the structure are only those\nfeaturing the acceleration of the seismic mass; all the other nodal external\nforces\/moments have to be set to zero. The overall deformation of the struc-\nture depends only on its inertia properties. Therefore the external excitation\nF (t) applied to the structure can be expressed as follows\nF (t) = M\u2217Ga (A.12)\n25\nwhere M\u2217 is a scalar quantity representing the seismic mass, G is a (n \u00d7 6)\nmatrix and a is the (6\u00d71) acceleration vector applied to the seismic mass, i.e.\naT = [ gx gy gz \u03c6x \u03c6y \u03c6z ] (A.13)\nwhere the translational acceleration components are given by the \u201cg\u201d compo-\nnents and the rotational ones by the\u201c\u03c6\u201d terms. The matrix G has either zero\nor unity entries, in order to apply the specific acceleration components to the\ndegrees of freedom representing the seismic mass motion.\nAs a consequence of the previous assumptions, the cross-PSD of the external\nexcitations can be expressed as\nSFiFk(\u03bd) = M\n2\n\u2217GijGklSajal(\u03bd) (A.14)\nwhere Sajal is the cross-PSD of the external accelerations. Note that in (A.14)\nthere is no summation on j and l, since each degree of freedom associated to\nthe seismic mass is related only to one component of the external acceleration.\nTherefore substituting (A.14) via (A.2) into the displacement cross-PSD (A.1)\nand this latter into the elemental stress cross-PSD (A.10) yields the explicit\nrelation which holds between acceleration and elemental stresses\nS\n(e)\n\u03c3i\u03c3m\n(\u03bd)=\n\u2211n\nl=1\n\u2211n\nq=1\nD\n(e)\nilmq\n(x,y,z)\n\u2211n\nr=1\n\u2211n\ns=1\n\u2211n\nj=1\n\u2211n\nk=1\nUlqrsjk(\u03bd)GjtGkuSatau (\u03bd)(A.15)\nwhere\nUlqrsjk(\u03bd) = M\n2\n\u2217\n1\n\u03c92r\n1\n\u03c92s\nulruqsurjuskH\u02dcr(\u03bd)Hs(\u03bd) (A.16)\nEq. (A.15) can be written in matrix form as follows\nS(e)\u03c3\u03c3(\u03bd) = D\n(e)(x, y, z)U(\u03bd)GSaa(\u03bd)G\nT (A.17)\nThe stress cross-PSD in eq. (A.17) seems to be related to the magnitude of\nthe seismic mass M\u2217. This is not true, since the free response eigenvectors are\nnormalized versus the mass matrix M: if the seismic mass M\u2217 is some order\nof magnitudes larger than any other mass in the structure, it also represents\nthe dominant term in the overall mass matrix M 1 . Thus, due to the normal-\nization, the eigenvector components are inversely proportional to\n\u221a\nM\u2217 and so\n(A.17) is independent from the M\u2217.\n1 The rotational inertia terms are proportional to the seismic mass module M\u2217\nmultiplied by a properly scaled squared gyration radius.\n26\n"}
