The yrast sequence in 100Mo has been extended to a\ntentative spin\/parity s20+d, while the decoupled band built on the Ip= 112 \u2212 isomeric state in 99Mo has been\nextended through the first alignment up to a tentative spin\/parity of s432 \u2212d. The results are compared with\nself-consistent, cranked-mean-field calculations using a Woods-Saxon potential. The alignment systematics of\nthe intruder h11\/2 bands in the N=57 isotones from Mo sZ=42d to Cd sZ=48d and the yrast sequences in their\nN=58 even-even neighbors are discussed. An overall picture emerges, where the alignment properties evolve\nfrom being due to positive-parity neutrons in the 48\n105Cd to predominantly sg9\/2d2 proton crossings closer to the\nZ=40 subshell. Qualitatively, this can be explained by an increase in the quadrupole deformation and a\nsimultaneous lowering of the proton Fermi surface in the g9\/2 shell with decreasing proton number. These data\nprovide excellent examples of rotational-alignment phenomena in weakly deformed nuclei.\nDOI: 10.1103\/PhysRevC.68.044313 PACS number(s): 21.10.Re, 23.20.Lv, 27.60.1j\nThe cranked shell model (CSM) [1] and associated\ncranked-Woods-Saxon-Strutinsky mean-field [2\u20134] methods\nhave been successful in interpreting the high-spin behavior\nin a wide range of well-deformed sb\u00f80.25d nuclei. In par-\nticular, the predictions of rotational alignments of high-j or-\nbitals due to the Coriolis interaction in rare-earth nuclei are\ngenerally well reproduced [1]. In contrast, the applicability\nof the CSM to less deformed regions of the Segr\u00e9 chart re-\nmains less certain. Perhaps paradoxically, the Coriolis effects\nresponsible for the rotational alignment phenomena associ-\nated with well-deformed rare-earth nuclei are arguably larg-\nest in systems with small intrinsic deformations [5]. This\narises since the Coriolis matrix element has a linear depen-\ndence on \"2\/I, where I is the moment of inertia [6].\nRotational-like sequences in the N=57 and N=58 isotones\nbetween the subshell closure at Z=40sZrd and the magic\nnumber at Z=50sSnd present particularly good laboratories\nwith which to probe such Coriolis-driven alignment effects\nin weakly deformed nuclei (e.g., Refs. [7\u201316]). The odd-A,\nN=57 isotones systematically exhibit weakly deformed, de-\ncoupled bands associated with the population of the low-V\ncomponents of the unique-parity h11\/2 orbital [8,9]. By com-\nparing the observed increase in aligned angular momentum\nas the structures of these decoupled negative-parity se-\nquences evolve with spin, it is possible to gain insight into\nthe nature of the particles that are responsible for the align-\nment. Since the predicted alignment gains and crossing fre-\nquencies are also shape dependent, the study of these high-\nspin processes can provide insight into the nuclear shape\nprior to the alignment, albeit in a model-dependent way (e.g.,\nRefs. [7,14]). Related to this question, there has been recent\ndiscussion in the literature with regard to the evolution from\nvibrational to rotational-like sequences in the A,100\u2013110\nregion. This change in structure is argued to be associated\nwith a stabilization of the nuclear quadrupole shape follow-\ning the population of low V, neutron h11\/2 orbitals, which, in\nthe Nilsson scheme have equatorial trajectories for prolate\nshapes [15,17].\nThe Coriolis interaction is largest for particles with large j\nvalues and large intrinsic alignments on the rotation axis\n(i.e., small V values) [5]. Therefore as the atomic number is\nreduced and the Fermi surface falls lower in the g9\/2 subshell,\none might expect an increased influence on alignments from\nthe lower-V Nilsson components of the g9\/2 protons. This can\nbe explained by the position of the proton Fermi surface\nchanging from the mid-to-high V orbitals of the g9\/2 subshell\nfor 48\n105Cd57 to the lower-V components for 42\n99Mo57. By com-\nparison with the CSM, the alignment properties in the decou-\npled, h11\/2 structures in the N=57 isotones 46103Pd and 48105Cd\nhave also been shown to demonstrate a strong dependence on\nthe quadrupole deformation [9]. Specifically the observation*Corresponding author.

This is consistent with the small\nquadrupole deformation sb2\u01420.15d expected for this \u201cnear-\nmagic\u201d isotone. In contrast, a more complicated scenario has\nbeen suggested for 46\n103Pd, where the alignment has been at-\ntributed to the simultaneous alignment of both g7\/2 neutrons\nand g9\/2 protons [9]. This is associated with an increase in\ndeformation for 103Pd compared to 105Cd and a simultaneous\nlowering of the proton Fermi surface in to more easily\n\u2018alignable\u2019 orbitals [9], lower in the subshell. Following this\ntrend, our recent study of 44\n101Ru revealed a sequence where\nthe increase in alignment appears to come almost exclusively\nfrom the g9\/2 protons, with no evidence for any effect due to\nthe g7\/2 neutron orbital [8].\nMotivated by these aspects, we report new data pertinent\nto the alignment processes in the negative-parity intruder se-\nquence in the N=57 isotone, 4299Mo, and its even-even neigh-\nbor, 100Mo. This enables a complete picture of the alignment\nsystematics of the h11\/2 bands in the even-Z, N=57 isotones\n42\n99Mo, 44\n101Ru, 46\n103Pd, and 48\n105Cd to be made. When compared\nwith cranked-Woods-Saxon calculations, the overall results\nhighlight the increasingly important impact of the g9\/2 pro-\ntons on the alignment properties of these structures with de-\ncreasing proton number. These systematics provide excellent\nexamples of multiple facets of rotational alignment phenon-\nema in weakly deformed nuclei.\nThe rather neutron-rich nature of 99Mo and 100Mo make\nhigh-spin studies of these nuclei experimentally challenging.\nThis is due to the lack of suitable choices for stable beam-\ntarget combinations with which these systems can be popu-\nlated via fusion-evaporation reactions. The spins, parities,\nand main spherical-basis single-particle parentage of the\nlow-lying states in 99Mo (including that of the Ip= 112 \u2212, T1\/2\n=760 ns isomer at 684 keV) are however well established\nfrom charged-particle pick-up and stripping reactions (see,\ne.g., Ref. [18]). Previous work on the h11\/2 structure of 99Mo\nhas been carried out using backed-target deep-inelastic reac-\ntions [7]. It has also been studied via the weakly populated,\na2n side-channel from our previous work on 101Ru [8,17].\nThe yrast sequence in 100Mo is known only to a tentative\nspin\/parity of 12+, via both binary reaction [7] and light-ion\ninduced fusion-evaporation [19] studies.\nIn the current work, the nuclei of interest were populated\nusing heavy-ion binary reactions between a self-supporting,\ns420 mg\/cm2d 100Mo target and a 136Xe beam at an energy of\n700 MeV. The beam was provided by the 889 cyclotron at\nthe Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and had a natu-\nral pulsing of <2\u22123 ns width, separated by 64 ns. Typical\nbeam currents were the order of 1\u20132 pnA. Reaction g rays\nwere detected using the GAMMASPHERE array [20],\nwhich, in this experiment, consisted of 102 Compton-\nsuppressed hyperpure germanium detectors. The binary frag-\nments were detected using the position-sensitive gas-filled\ndetector, CHICO [21], which enabled an event-by-event\nDoppler correction to be applied to the raw g-ray data. The\ndetection of co-planar events in CHICO allowed the separa-\ntion of both beamlike and targetlike fragments by the mea-\nsurement of their position relative to the beam direction. The\nvelocity of the targetlike fragments was angle dependent and\ncalculated assuming two-body kinematics to vary between\n3% and 11% of the speed of light.\nThe acquisition master trigger required that at least three\nprompt, Compton-suppressed g rays were detected in GAM-\nMASPHERE within <50 ns of each other, together with\ntwo, co-planar binary fragments in CHICO. The heavy metal\ncollimators were removed from the GAMMASPHERE\nCompton-suppression shields, thereby allowing a measure of\nthe g-ray fold for each event to be made. The data were\nsorted into standard g-ray coincidence matrices and cubes\nwhich were subsequently analyzed using the RADWARE\npackage [22]. A total of 9003106 suppressed germanium\ntriples and higher-fold events were detected in coincidence\nwith two co-planar binary fragments during the course of a\nfour day experiment.\nUsing the temporal separation between prompt Doppler-\nshifted transitions which feed isomeric states and those tran-\nsitions which depopulate such isomers and decay from frag-\nments stopped in the CHICO detector, time-correlated\nspectroscopy could be performed. In this way delayed gates\nwere set on transitions depopulating the T1\/2=760 ns, Ip\n=\n11\n2\n\u2212 isomeric state in 99Mo [23] and the prompt transitions\nabove the isomer could be clearly identified. Examples of\nspectra generated from this analysis are shown in Fig. 1,\ntogether with a sum of prompt, double-gated g-ray coinci-\ndences on the h11\/2 band members in 99Mo and the yrast band\nin 100Mo. The transitions were ordered in terms of their ob-\nserved coincidence intensity relative to the lowest band\nFIG. 1.

The spin and parity assignments were\nmade assuming that the observed transitions all have\nstretched E2 character. The energies of the transitions and\ntheir mutually coincident \u2018in-band\u2019 nature are consistent with\nsimilar E2 cascades built on the yrast and decoupled bands in\nthe neighboring isotones [8,9].\nFigure 2 shows the azimuthal angle versus the time-of-\nflight difference observed by CHICO. The beamlike and tar-\ngetlike fragments are separated by the reaction kinematics\nand the yields for both are peaked around the expected labo-\nratory grazing angles of ,26\u00b0 and 48\u00b0, respectively. Figure 3\nshows fold distributions for 100Mo and nearby nuclei. Up to\nspin 8\" in 100Mo the spectra are dominated by a low-fold\nreaction mechanism (assumed to be Coulomb excitation),\nwhile states above the 10+ level (associated with the aligned\nsnh11\/2d2 configuration [7]) have distributions shifted to sig-\nnificantly higher folds, associated with deep-inelastic colli-\nsions. The quasielastic two-neutron transfer to 102Mo has a\nrather narrow fold distribution intermediate between that of\nCoulomb excitation and deep inelastic.\nIn our previous work using the 96Zrs9Be,a2nd99Mo reac-\ntion [8], two new transitions at 979 and 1055 keV were\nadded to the h11\/2 decoupled sequence. The spectra in Fig. 1\nconfirm the 979-keV transition but also demonstrate that the\nreported 1055 keV transition is in fact a merging of two\nseparate in-band transitions, namely, those at Eg=1049 and\n1063 keV. This deconvolution is important as the backbend-\ning associated with the new ordering of these two transitions\nhas a considerable impact on the deduced alignment.\nA comparison of the rotational-like behavior in the decou-\npled h11\/2 bands in the N=57 isotones and their N=58 even-\neven neighbors can be made in terms of the cranking model\nby extracting quantities such as the total aligned angular mo-\nmentum Ix and the quasiparticle angular momentum, ix [1].\nFigure 3 shows the comparison between the extracted ix for\nthe yrast-sequences in the even-even cores of the N=58 iso-\ntones between Mo sZ=42d and Cd sZ=48d, together with the\nsame quantity for the decoupled h11\/2 sequence in the N\n=57 isotonic neighbors. Note in each case the clear blocking\neffect associated with the population of the h11\/2 neutron or-\nbital. The general trend is a \u2018mirroring\u2019 of the second align-\nment observed in the N=58 even-even core with the first\nalignment observed in the N=57 intruder band.\nIn order to compare the experimental data with state-of-\nthe-art, quantitive, microscopic theoretical predictions in the\nbandcrossing region, cranked-Woods-Saxon-Strutinsky cal-\nculations have been performed by means of total-Routhian-\nsurface (TRS) calculations [3] in a three-dimensional defor-\nmation space sb2,b4,gd using the same procedure as outlined\nin Ref. [8]. At a given frequency, the deformation of a state is\ndetermined by minimizing the calculated TRS.

The comparatively lower rotational fre-\nquency of the (single component) first alignment in 105Cd has\nbeen discussed in terms of a sg7\/2d2 neutron crossing from\nblocking arguments and on the basis of the mirroring of the\nincrease in ix in the yrast sequence in 106Cd above the sh11\/2d2\nneutron alignment [11]. This implies that only one type of\ncrossing [i.e., either sg7\/2d2 neutrons or sg9\/2d2 protons] is ob-\nserved in the 105Cd case. This alignment pattern is not as well\nreproduced as the lighter N=57 isotones in the calculations\npresented in Fig. 3. The h11\/2 band in 103Pd appears to show\na double crossing (as deduced from the large and continual\nincrease in quasiparticle alignment over a wide frequency\nrange). As pointed out in Ref. [9], this observation favors the\nargument that the alignment observed for 105Cd is predomi-\nnantly due to the sg7\/2d2 neutrons [9]. This is consistent with\nthe expectation that the spg9\/2d2 aligned configuration be-\ncomes more favored with decreasing proton number, while\nthe crossing frequency of the sg7\/2d2 neutrons is predicted to\nremain approximately constant (assuming similar deforma-\ntions) for the N=57 isotones 105Cd and 103Pd (Fig. 5).\nThe experimentally deduced alignment gain for 101Ru is\nreproduced by the theoretical calculations rather well. The\ncombination of increased deformation compared to the\nheavier isotones, (105Cd and 103Pd), coupled to the lowering\nof the proton Fermi surface is demonstrated in the calcula-\ntions to result in a predicted alignment which is dominated\nby the nh11\/2 ^ spg9\/2d2 configuration above the crossing.\nThe new data on 99Mo show an even more dramatic in-\ncrease in alignment than that observed for 101Ru, with a\nbackbend observed (rather than an upbend as seen in the\nheavier isotones). This is consistent with the weaker interac-\ntion expected for the spg9\/2d2 crossing associated with the\nlower-V orbitals, which reside closer to the Fermi surface for\n99Mo. As with the nh11\/2 structure in 101Ru, the increased\ncore deformation with respect to 105Cd and 103Pd is respon-\nsible for pushing the predicted sng7\/2d2 crossing up to higher\nfrequencies, which probably explains why they are not ob-\nserved in the current work. It is also worthy of note that the\nFIG. 4.

H. REGAN et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 68, 044313 (2003)\n044313-4\nhighest spin transition tentatively deduced for the yrast struc-\nture of 100Mo suggests the beginnings of an alignment at a\nsimilar frequency to that observed in the intruder band in the\nneighboring 99Mo.\nThe total Routhian surface calculations for the lowest-\nlying negative-parity sequence in 99Mo are shown in Fig. 6.\nThe predicted quadrupole deformation for this minimum has\nb2,0.2, but the minimum is soft with respect to both qua-\ndruple and triaxial degrees of freedom. The predicted effect\nof the sg9\/2d2 proton alignment is to make this minimum even\nmore g and b soft, resulting in a rather, astable, low-\ndeformation configuration. It is perhaps rather surprising that\nthe rotational-based CSM reproduces the experimental data\nso well in nuclei, which appear to have quasivibrational\nstructure. We also note that at higher rotational frequencies\nsv<0.7 MeV\/\", corresponding to aligned spin values of\n<25\u219230\"), a well-defined superdeformed minimum ap-\npears in the potential energy surface for 99Mo at an axially\nsymmetric deformation of b2<0.4, at an excitation energy of\napproximately 1 MeV above the global minimum. A similar\nprediction has been made for the even-even neighbor 100Mo\n[25]. The current experiment used an energy of approxi-\nmately 25% above the nominal Coulomb barrier between the\ntarget and projectile [26], which using the semiclassical\n\u201crolling-mode\u201d approximation [27] corresponds to a maxi-\nmum expected value of the targetlike fragment intrinsic spin\nof ,25\". We note that this is close to what is observed\ndiscretely in the current experiment. For a heavier beam\n(such as 208Pb) at a similar energy above the Coulomb barrier\ns25\u201330%d, the predicted rolling mode input spin is greater\nthan 30 \", which may be enough to populate the predicted\nsuperdeformed minimum in both 99Mo and 100Mo.\nIn summary, the near-yrast states of the N=57 and 58\nnuclei 99,100Mo have been investigated using thin-target,\nheavy-ion-induced binary reactions. The partial decay\nschemes for these systems have been extended into the first\nband crossing region for the h11\/2 structure in 99Mo and to the\nstart of the second alignment in the yrast sequence in 100Mo.\nCSM calculations suggest both of these crossings are due to\nthe favored rotational alignment of low-V components on\nthe proton g9\/2 shell. When compared with the alignment\nsystematics of the analogous structures in the neighboring\nN=57 and 58 isotones, and with cranked-Woods-Saxon-\nStrutinksy calculations, a consistent picture emerges of the\nincreasing importance of the low-V g9\/2 protons in the\naligned configuration with decreasing proton number and the\nreduced effect of the g7\/2 neutrons with increasing core\ndeformation.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by EPSRC (UK) and the U.S.\nDepartment of Energy, under Grant Nos.
