Now postgraduates often recoil from it; they see it as the preserve of \nanoraks.\u201d (Amin and Thrift, 2000, 4). \n \n \u201cSome want to give Left geography marks for revolutionary content: presumably \n7\/10 in the 1960s and 1970s but only 4\/10 now. How absurd.\u201d (Amin and Thrift, \n2005, 221). \n \n\u201cRecovering a sense of political economy is one of the most urgent tasks \nconfronting economic geography.\u201d (Martin and Sunley, 2001, 55).  \n \n\u201cWhat Is To Be Done?\u201d (Lenin, 1917). \n \n \nIntroduction \n \n 2\nOver the years there has been quite a lively debate in the pages of Antipode as \nto the character of a progressive radical geography \u2013 both what it is and what it \nought to be. Given Antipode\u2019s chosen mission, it comes as no surprise that a \nconcern with the intellectual character of a progressive radical geography and its \nassociated political strategies is constantly simmering on the back-burner and \nevery now and again erupts as the heat is turned up and the pot boils over. Nor \nis it any surprise that this debate has increasingly come to focus on the place of \nMarxian political economy as the dominance that it held following its key role in \nthe emergence of radical geography in the 1970s and 1980s has been \nprogressively \u2013 or to be more accurate, in many ways regressively \u2013 challenged \nover the last two decades. This has revealed some quite sharply different views \non this, both within \u201cthe Left\u201d as well as between \u201cthe Left\u201d and others (for \nexample, see Smith, 1989; Folke and Sayer, 191; Hadjimichalis, 1991; Sayer, \n1992; and most recently, Amin and Thrift, 2005), although as the debate has \ngone on, deciding \u201cwhat\u2019s Left\u201d has become more difficult as previously clear \nlines have become blurred1. Broadly speaking, two things happened in the \n1990s. Some of us continued to adhere to a Marxian political economy while \nacknowledging the lacunae within it and exploring its complementarity to other \napproaches as a way of filling them. Others continued to question its relevance \nfrom within the many \u201cpost-isms\u201d that emerged and continued to seek further to \nerode the authority of Marxian political economy on both theoretical and political \n                                                 \n1 It is only fair to point out that the late 1980s\/early 1990s exchange in Antipode was in part \nprovoked by an earlier and more bitter debate in the pages of Society and Space, as David \nHarvey (1987) rounded on a variety of critics of Marxism within the social sciences (the \nimmediate trigger was a scurrilous and thoroughly disreputable piece by Saunders and Williams, \n1986) and in the process stepped heavily on several toes within geography, as the subsequent \nresponses to his paper revealed only too clearly. Walker\u2019s intervention in Antipode was an \nattempt \u201cin an ecumenical spirit\u201d: 135) to find some common ground for a broad Left project while \nstrongly defending the centrality of Marxian approaches within it, and the responses to it were \ngenerally much more considered, tempered by the collapse of state socialism in the USSR and its \nsatellite states in central and eastern Europe as well as by the resurgence of neo-liberalism in the \nUK and USA. At the risk of stating the obvious, I think it imperative that the contemporary debate \navoids the sharp and personalized edge of that of the 1980s and follows the spirit of Walker\u2019s \nintervention in recognition of the need both to recognize diversity within the Left and at the same \ntime to find common ground in the search for a political Left strategy while acknowledging the \ncontinuing relevance of Marxism to this endeavour. \n 3\ngrounds. As a result, a fragile and uneasy sort of truce prevailed within an \nincreasingly plural and fragmented human geography.    \n \nMore recently, this provisional truce was rudely disturbed, but from a surprising \ndirection, and with some odd consequences. This revolved around a debate \nupon the character of economic geography \u2013 both what it is and what it ought to \nbe \u2013 stimulated by a polemical intervention by my good friends and old \ncolleagues Ash Amin and Nigel Thrift\u2019s (2000)2, triggered by what they saw as \nthe dangers of economic geographers turning (again) to mainstream neo-\nclassically inspired economics in response to the rise of the \u201cNew Geographical \nEconomics\u201d (Krugman, 1991; 2000) and an associated \u201cNew Economic \nGeography\u201d. I share these worries. They bemoaned the decline of interest of \neconomic geographers in the concerns that were central to Marxian political \neconomy, such as inequality and uneven development, and on this point I whole \n-heartedly agree with them. What was more surprising is that their proposed \nsolution to revivify economic geography involved a turn to the cultural and social, \nto an emphasis on the socio-cultural constitution of the economy and a concern \nwith the specific forms of practice through which capitalist organizations \n(re)produce themselves. Again, in so far as it went, I\u2019d go along with this \u2013 but \nwhat I found much less plausible was their seeming indifference to political \neconomy in general and to Marxian political economy in particular. Indeed, in so \nfar as any consideration of Marxian approaches registered on their radar, it was \nonly to seem to reject them out of hand. This seemed odd given their crie de \ncoeur for economic geographers seriously to re-engage with issues of inequality \nand uneven development. \n \nThus far I\u2019ve kept out of these debates, partly because there\u2019s a distinct sense of \nd\u00e9j\u00e0 vu to quite a lot of them, although I\u2019m prepared to concede that this may \nsimply be a reflection of advancing age and a continuing predilection, \n                                                 \n2 Deliberately or inadvertently, the title of their intervention bore a more than a passing \nresemblance to the title of an earlier article by David Harvey (1974), which again sought to \nchallenge prevailing orthodoxies but in a very different way.  \n 4\nmetaphorically at least, for a certain sort of rainwear \u2013 the bright red anorak in \nwhich I continue to feel very comfortable3. Now, however, I feel the need to say \nsomething about all this, not least because the most recent intervention by Amin \nand Thrift (2005) has once again called in to question the value of the Marxian \ntradition and suggested that Marxian political economy, \u201cin its many forms\u201d, is \nwell past its sell buy date. As they put it (Amin and Thrift, 2005, 221): \u201cIn the \nrecent past, the tradition of Left thinking that seemed most to typify the four \nvalues [that define a Left normativity] was Marxism (already, it should be added \nin its many forms). However, it is difficult to see how this position can be \nmaintained any longer, not only because new approaches have been added to \nthe repertoire of the Left, but also because a series of re-workings of the world \nhave taken place; re-workings that require new political strategies and new \npolitical imaginations\u201d, \n \nI can agree that the world has been re-worked in various ways and that we need \na variety of theoretical perspectives to grasp its complexity \u2013 but this is hardly \nnews. Crucially, however, it remains a world driven by and to a considerable \nextent decisively re-worked by the logic of capital and capital accumulation and \nstructured in deep and fundamental ways by the class structural capital\/labour \nrelation. And so while I can agree that awarding marks for the revolutionary \ncontent of Left geography is a dubious pursuit (absurd is maybe a bit harsh \u2013 and \nit\u2019d be interesting to know who they see as doing the awarding in pursuit of this \nnew disciplinary technology), I could not disagree more about the relevance of \nMarxian political economy to contemporary critical geography, theoretically and \npolitically. Indeed, if the dismissive view espoused by Amin and Thrift were to \nprevail and critical geography and radical analysis abandoned their engagement \n                                                 \n3 And in this respect I\u2019m proud to join Trevor Barnes among the ranks of the anorak wearers, \neven though his was of a different colour: see Barnes, 2001.  \n 5\nwith Marxian political economy \u201cin its many forms\u201d, they would undoubtedly be \nseriously disabled, with severe theoretical and political consequences4.  \n \nAt this point, given that there is variety within the Marxian tradition rather than \nMarxism constituting a single unified approach, let me clarify how I understand \nMarxian political economy and the version of it that I wish to defend: this is an \n\u201copen\u201d approach to analysis and framing and answering questions that evolves \nas its complex object of analysis - capitalism and its geographies, with their \nemergent properties \u2013 contingently and tendentially evolves, rejecting the view of \nMarxism as a closed dogma that presumes a closed and reified view of the \naccumulation process and the trajectory of capitalist development (and if some \nchoose to read it in that way, then that\u2019s a problem with them rather than with \nMarxism). As Bob Jessop (2004, 161-2) expresses it, \u201call tendencies in \ncapitalism are themselves tendential\u201d, resulting in a \u201cdoubly tendential dynamic\u201d \nthat lies at the heart of the processes of capitalist development. Put another way, \nthen by \u201copen\u201d in this context I mean a Marxian approach that is consistent with \nthe approach of critical realism (see Sayer, 1984)5, acknowledging that there are \nnecessary causal structures that define particular types of society but that \nsocieties encompass multiple causal structures, not all of which in this sense are \nnecessary and not all of which are equally powerful. Moreover, the causal \npowers inherent in such structures can only be contingently realised in specific \ntime-space contexts. As a result, there may be emergent effects that cannot \nreadily be anticipated. While the causal powers inherent in the social relations of \ncapital are pre-eminent and must be present in the sense that they define \ncapitalist societies as capitalist, it does not follow that they have a determinate \n(let alone deterministic) influence on each and every occasion in shaping the \neconomic geographies of capitalism. This is an important qualification, and one \n                                                 \n4 As a result of such a sweeping and unqualified dismissal of all forms of Marxian political-\neconomy, the baby may well disappear with the bathwater (although for some, such as Yeung \n(2001, 172) what I\u2019d take to be the baby, Marxian political economy, others see as the bathwater). \n5 As with Marxism, there have been \u2013 and continue to be \u2013 debates as to the character of critical \nrealism and its relationship to other realist and non-realist approaches. For a recent example that \npartly intersects with the debates about economic geography, see M\u00e4ki et al, 2004. \n 6\nworth making at the outset. That said, there are real dangers in abandoning the \nmost powerful theoretical apparatus available to us to understand the varied \ngeographies of capitalism, the (re)production of inequality and uneven \ndevelopment. As a result, some of you may detect a mildly polemical tone in \nsome of what follows \u2013 and I make no apologies for this. \n \nSo by way of a beginning, I want to go back to the 1960s and recall the reasons \nwhy economic geographers then re-discovered Marxian political economy, as it \nseems to me that there\u2019s still something to be learned from that time \u2013 and this \nholds true for human geography for more generally - although given recent \ndebates I choose here to develop it in the specific context of economic \ngeography. Then I want to go on to consider the reasons why in its turn Marxian \npolitical economy \u2013 or at least certain strands and readings of it \u2013 became \nsubject to critique, the alternatives that were then explored as part of this critique, \nand their relationship to Marxian political economy. Finally, I want to try to pull the \nargument together in a concluding section. \n \n \nSome history of geographical thought from the 1950s and 1960s: \nthe re-discovery of Marx by geographers \n \nThe prime focus of my concern here is the rise of spatial science and neo-\nclassically inspired location theories and the reasons for the subsequent rapid \nturn from these to Marxian political economy. Geographers became interested in \nspatial science and location theory because, for the first time in a long time, they \nwished to engage seriously with the question of explaining the spatial patterning \nof human economies and societies, with the structure of the space economy as \nIsard (1956) put it \u2013 and it is easy, now, to forgot just how important a move this \nwas at the time in putting questions of explanation and theory firmly back on the \nagenda. The turn to Marxian political economy reflected a rapid recognition by \nsome more critically-minded geographers of the explanatory limitations of what \n 7\nonly very recently had themselves seemed radically new and powerful \napproaches, of the under-socialised, impoverished explanatory content of spatial \nscience and neo-classical location theories6.  \n \nIt is worth emphasising that this is a critique that remains equally valid for the \n\u2018New Economic Geography\u201d and the \u201cNew Geographical Economics\u201d of the \n1990s (for example, Krugman, 1991; Martin, 1999; many of the contributions to \nthe debate initiated by Amin and Thrift noted above; and in Clark et al, 2000, \nincluding Krugman), which remain essentially committed to methodological \nindividualism and thinly socialised explanatory accounts. As Allen Scott (204, \n483) has pointed out, \u201cstrictly speaking\u201d, Krugman\u2019s work and the work of others \nthat it has inspired is not neo-classical, since it firmly eschews any notion of \nconstant returns to scale and perfect competition. However, that said, it retains a \nstrong kinship with mainstream economics by reason of its commitment to \nmethodological individualism, full information utility-maximising individuals and \nprofit-maximizing firms, and an exclusive focus on socially disembedded relations \nof exchange (Dymski, 1996). Indeed the rise of technically more sophisticated \nversions of the neo-classical location theory orthodoxies of the 1950s and 1960s \nought in itself to act as a sharp warning to those committed to a critical and \nprogressive geography. For it is indicative and symptomatic of an attempt to \nrevive approaches that were then revealed as seriously flawed and limited in \ntheir explanatory power and sophistication. Their resurgence represents part of a \nbroader assault on critical approaches in the social sciences and of an attempt \nby the proponents of the approaches of mainstream economics and their \nadvocates in economic geography to re-occupy the space from which they were \nejected by the rise of Marxian political economy, on the basis of both their \ntheoretical inadequacy and shallowness and their pernicious and regressive \npolitical implications.  \n                                                 \n6 This re-discovery of the Marxian tradition was by no means confined to human geography. \nIndeed in political economy, development studies and sociology scholars such as Samir Amin, \nBaran and Sweezy, Lefebvre, Mandel and Poulantzas were at the forefront of this re-\nengagement. The events of 1968 and the Vietnam war helped create space for this renewed \nconcern with a more radical social science. \n 8\n \nIn seeking to appreciate the continuing relevance of Marxian political economy, \nthen, it is important to remember that the reason for turning to it was the need to \nget a better grip on social process, and the social grounding and relations of the \neconomy, on what defined capitalist economies as capitalist. A central aspect of \nthis was recognition of a need to get below and beyond the surface appearances \nof capitalist economies and their geographies to those structural relations and \nprocesses that had causal effectivity and that could help explain why capitalist \neconomies and their geographies were as they were. This above all was the \ncentral issue. The concepts of value theory provided the tools to tackle it. \nConcepts such as mode of production, commodities and their exchange value \nand use value, labour-power and the labour process, and uneven development \nallowed a much more powerful understanding of the geographies of capitalist \neconomies than had hitherto been possible. Extensions to include notions such \nas social formations and the articulation of modes of production allowed a more \nsophisticated understanding of the relations between capitalist and non-capitalist \nmodes of production, of the links between capitalist and non-capitalist and non-\nclass social relations, and the ways in which these are subject to the real \nsubsumption of capital, deepening understanding of the mosaic of uneven \ndevelopment at multiple spatial scales7. Without doubt, the most powerful and \nsophisticated version of this revived and enriched historical-geographical \nmaterialism emerged in 1982 with the publication of David Harvey\u2019s magisterial \naccount of The Limits to Capital (recently re-considered in a major symposium in \nthe pages of Antipode: see Castree et al, 2004).  \n \nAs Doreen Massey (1995, 307), reflecting on developments a decade on since \nthe publication of another of the major landmarks of the last four decades, Spatial \n                                                 \n7 It is worth adding that more recent work has emphasised the ways in which a variety of social \nrelations which are integral to capitalism (for example, of gender or ethnicity), along with their \nassociated concepts of value and processes of valuation, have become deeply entangled with the \ncapitalist production of value and the capital;labour class relation in which this is grounded. This \nencompasses both the enabling of specific forms of capitalist production and value creation \nand\/or the appropriation of values produced under different social relations by those of capital \n(see Lee, 2005). \n 9\nDivisions of Labour, was at pains to emphasise, the value categories of Marxian \npolitical economy are vital to understanding the economic geographies of \ncapitalism8. She trenchantly argues that the law of value is useful for thinking \nthrough the broad structures of the economy and for forming the \u201cabsolutely \nessential basis for some central concepts \u2013 exploitation for instance\u201d. Thus value \ntheory describes a specific set of social relationships in which exploitation is a \nprocess of extracting surplus labour that can only be understood in the context of \nthe wider social forms constitutive of capitalism as a system of commodity \nproduction. Value theory therefore helps elucidate the decisive social \nrelationshipsspecific to capitalism and to the contemporary world.9  \n \nThis is not to deny that certain aspects of value analysis continue to generate \ndebate and disagreement \u2013 for example, the \u201ctransformation problem\u201d and the \nrelationship between values and prices (for example, see Rankin, 1987; Roberts, \n1987). However, this apparent controversy is more illusory than substantive, \nbased upon a conflation of qualitatively different price and value categories. As \nMassey (1995, 307) points out, attempts to use value theory as a basis for \nempirical economic calculation are misconceived and doomed to failure. Indeed, \n\u201cthe byzantine entanglements into which the \u2018law of value\u2019 has fallen make it \n\u2026unusable in any empirical economic calculus\u201d. It is therefore important not to \nconfuse values and prices conceptually or seek to equate empirical data measured \nin prices with theoretical constructs defined in terms of values. The significance of \nvalue analysis lies in the way in which it focuses attention upon class relationships \nand the social structures that they help to define. It is very difficult, not to say \nimpossible, to see how else other than in terms of the labour theory of value that \nwe can explain where profits come from and why the capital\/labour relation \nremains the key to understanding the accumulation process that lies at the core \nof capitalist societies. \n                                                 \n8 Nor was she alone in arguing this. Many other influential geographers also did so. For example, \nDick Walker (1989, 136) stressed that \u201ccertain concepts such as class, exploitation, value and capital \naccumulation [offer] true insights into the nature of the present-day capitalist world\u201d. \n9 It is also worth pointing out that as a consequence there are things that value theory cannot deal \nwith: for example, issues such as emotion and feelings cannot be captured in value categories.  \n 10\n \n \nThe critique of Marxian political economy: exploring a variety of \nother theoretical positions in social sciences \n \nNo sooner had critical geographers begun to engage with the Marxian tradition \nthan others began to criticise them on various grounds for so doing. These \ncritiques were raised for a variety of reasons \u2013 which I will consider later \u2013 but for \nthe moment let me simply record that they often depended on reading Marxian \npolitical economy in particular ways, for particular purposes. For example, \nreflecting a broader spirit of the times (perhaps most forcefully expressed by \nThompson, 1978), geographers exploring the potential of Marxism were accused \nof structural determinism, although it was and is debatable as to the extent to \nwhich these accusations were justifiable (for example, I certainly don\u2019t read \nHarvey as a structural determinist, and he represented the forefront of the re-\ndiscovery of Marxism and the reconstruction of a materialist historical-geography \nof capitalism). For others, the source of critique lay in the \u201cunscientific\u201d character \nof Marxian political economy and its failure to translate its theories into \nmathematical languages. Clearly, Marxian approaches came in for criticism from \na variety of perspectives that were themselves at times incompatible. \nNonetheless, the effect of such varied critiques was to encourage geographers \n(among others) to explore other positions in the social sciences that were seen to \nput more weight on agency and that allowed fuller consideration of the variety of \nevolutionary paths and instituted forms of capitalism through time and over space \nand so on. \n \nAgency, structure \n \nIn response to the criticism that Marxian political economy privileged structure at \nthe expense of (individual or collective) agency, closing off space for agency and \npractice, geographers engaged with a range of positions in modern social theory \n 11\nthat sought to understand relationships between structure and agency, \nrecognising the influence of each on the other but giving greater weight to \nagency in the explanation of social action (notably in Giddens\u2019 theory of \nstructuration (1979; 1981; 1984; see also Thrift, 1983). In fact, Bourdieu (1977; \n1981) incorporates a more nuanced conception of the co-determining relations \nbetween agency and structure that recognises the social constitution of \nstructures and the structuration of agency10. This opened space for a subsequent \nrange of approaches emphasising practice11 but its more immediate effect was to \nfocus attention upon relations between agency and structure.  \n \nAs Lipietz (1993, 128) has put it, the increased emphasis on agency was at least \nin part a response to structuralist interpretations of Marxian political economy \nwhich \u201cfrom Levi Strauss to Lacan everywhere \u2018pummels the subject\u2019\u201d. However, \nit is important to stress that a structuralist reading is only one possible way of \ninterpreting Marxian political economy and indeed, could be seen as a particular \naberration of the 1970s and certain strands of French Marxism (Althusser, 1977; \nAlthusser and Balibar, 1970), which (mis)interpreted by Thompson (1978) led to \nhis \u201cintemperate rejection of everything Althusserian\u201d (Walker, 1989, 139). \nWhatever the rights and wrongs of the varying interpretations, the end result was \n                                                 \n10 Bourdieu (1977, 72) argues that the structure of a particular constitutive environment produces \n\u201chabitus, systems of durable, transposable dispositions, as structured structures, that is, as \nprinciples of the generation of practices and representations which can be objectively regulated \nand \u2018regular\u2019 without in any way being the product of obedience to rules\u201d.  They are \u201cobjectively \nadapted to their goals without pre-supposing a consensus aiming at ends or an express mastery \nof the operation necessary to attain them, and being all this collectively orchestrated without \nbeing the product of the orchestrating actor of the conductor\u201d. Bourdieu (1981, 309) later made a \ncritical point in insisting that habitus is \u201can analytic construct, a system of \u2018regulated \nimprovisation\u2019, or generative rules that represents the (cognitive, affective and evaluative) \ninternalisation by actors of past experience on the basis of shared typifications of social \ncategories, experienced phenomenally as \u2018people like us\u2019\u201d that varies by and is differentiated \nbetween social groups\u201d. Crucially, however, \u201cbecause of common histories, members of each \n\u2018class fraction\u2019 share similar habitus, creating regularities of thought, aspirations, dispositions, \npatterns of action that are linked to the position that persons occupy in the social structure they \ncontinually reproduce\u201d. While Bourdieu refers specifically to \u2018class fractions\u2019, commonality of \nexperience and identity could as well be based on \u2018people like us\u2019 defined via other social \nattributes, such as ethnicity, gender or place of residence. Furthermore, historical processes of \nclass formation will reflect the intersection of structures of class relations with those of other \nsocial structures (cf. Massey, 1995, 301-5). \n11 These could in due course be described as \u2018non-representational\u2019, although not in the 1980s.  \n 12\nto trigger a virulent backlash against structure and in favour of agency that was \nas one-sided as the position that it sought to critique.  \n \nHowever, as Anderson (1984) emphasises, there is a long history of a tension \nbetween the emphasis placed upon structural determination and the weight given \nto agency and practice that extends back to the origins of Marxian political \neconomy itself. Indeed, the inner time and developmental logic of capitalism can \nbe seen to reflect this irresolvable tension between agency and structure. As \nBourdieu\u2019s approach makes clear, there is no inconsistency between \nconsideration of issues of agency and practice and the concerns of a Marxian \napproach with the social determination of action and broader and deeper social \nstructural relations. Moreover, there is a strong thread of work within Marxian \npolitical economy concerned with the labour process and the organisation of \nwork as a process of people transforming nature via a range of mediating \u2018hard\u2019 \nand \u2018soft\u2019 technologies to produce socially useful things in the form of \ncommodities that emphasises agency and practice (for example, Beynon, 1973; \nBraverman, 1974; Burawoy, 1979). Seen in this light, the concern with \nelaborating what people do, how they do it and why they do it (since much of the \nlabour process literature emphasises the way in which people contest the \nimperatives of capital) can be seen as neither more nor less than an elaboration \nof a basic and central tenet of Marxian political economy.  \n \nEvolution, institutions, regulation \n \nAnother set of alternative approaches  explored by geographers such as Amin \n(1999),  Dunford (1990), and MacLeod (1997) relates to various strands of \nheterodox political economy and a nexus of evolutionary (for example, Nelson \nand Winter, 1982), institutional (for example, Hollingsworth, 2000) and \nregulationist (for example, Boyer, 1990) approaches to political economy, often \n 13\nlinked to theorisations of the state (for example, Jessop, 1990; 2002)12 and to \nconcerns with the non-economic foundations and the socio-spatial \n\u201cembeddedness\u201d of the economy, the close relations among and co-constitution \nof the economic and non-economic. In some cases these have clearly identifiable \nMarxian roots (notably strands of regulationist approaches) while in others the \norigins lie more in explicitly non-Marxian approaches to political economy \u2013 which \nis indicative of the variety within as well as among these approaches.  \n \nIrrespective of this variability, the central concern of these approaches is to \nelucidate the spatially and temporally variable forms that capitalist economies \nand their development trajectories can take (Hudson, 2005b). As such, they seek \nto identify the variety of mechanisms and processes through which capitalist \neconomies become possible, through which they are reproduced and through \nwhich their developmental and evolutionary paths can be steered in an attempt to \navoid a variety of systemic crises (for example, of accumulation; fiscal; \nlegitimation; or rationality: Habermas, 1976; O\u2019Connor, 1973).  \n \nOnce again, however, it is possible to argue that the development of such \n\u201cmiddle range\u201d theoretical concepts is neither more nor less than an elaboration \nand extension of existing concepts and ideas within Marxian political economy. \nIndeed, such \u201cmiddle range\u201d concepts, at a lower level of abstraction than those \nof value theory, have been developed within as well as outside a Marxian \nframework. For example, the Althusserian concept of social formation, cast at a \nlower level of abstraction than that of mode of production, is recognition that \ncapitalist economies are constituted in ways that vary over time and space and \nallows a more subtle interpretation of the historical-geographical specificity of \ncapitalist economies. Consideration of a wider range of evolutionary, institutional \nand regulationist approaches certainly allows for a fuller and more nuanced \nelaboration of these issues and of the uneven character of capitalist development \n                                                 \n12 Oddly, much of the more recent institutionalist literature has little if anything to say about the \nstate however. \n 14\nand how this is constituted but does so in ways that are consistent with key \npropositions within Marxian political economy. In short, and at the risk of some \nover-simplification, value theory explains why, but such approaches clarify how \nthe uneven geographies of capitalism are constituted as they are. As such, they \noffer complementary approaches within pluri-theoretical account.  \n \nCulture and the \u201ccultural turn\u201d \n \nA third development relates to the recent (so-called) \u201ccultural turn\u201d in economic \ngeography, with a resurgence of emphasis on \u2018cultural\u2019 approaches to \nunderstanding economies and their geographies, although these approaches are \nfar from uniform, broadly falling into ontological and epistemological concepts of \na \u201ccultural economy\u201d (Ray and Sayer, 1999)13. Of these, the epistemological \nconception is the least problematic. This envisages the \u201ccultural\u201d as a \u201cbottom up\u201d \nmethod of analysis, complementary to a more \u201ctop-down\u201d political economy, that \nfocuses upon the meanings that social practices and relations have for those \nenmeshed in them. For \u201ceconomic agents do not merely submit to the abstract \ncategory of \u2018market\u2019 or \u2018the dull compulsion of economic relations\u2019. Their \neconomic world is rich in contested meanings regarding what constitutes the \n\u2018market\/state\u2019, \u2018private\/public\u2019, \u2018competitiveness\u2019 and so on, and the rules and \nconventions according to which they should operate\u201d (Jessop and Sum, 2001, \n98). Equally, it presumes a self-reflexive recognition by political economists that \ntheir theories are constituted as situated knowledges that are (re)produced in \nspecific time\/space contexts, a view that has considerable merit. However, as I \nhave suggested above, it could reasonably be argued that Marxian political \neconomy has always contained strands of both \u201cbottom up\u201d and \u201ctop down\u201d \napproaches, with an enduring tension between the relative emphasis placed \nupon structure and agency (Anderson, 1984). Indeed, the issue is not one of \n                                                 \n13 As Costis Hadjimichalis has forcibly pointed out to me, repairing the bridge linking  the \u2018cultural\u2019 \nand the \u2018economic\u2019 is a very Anglo-American concern,  whereas in much of Leftist scholarship in \nsouthern Europe and Scandinavia, this divide was never opened up and so did not require \nbridging in the same way. \n 15\ncultural economy as a methodological complement to Marxian political economy \nbut rather an acknowledgement that a Marxian approach encompasses both \nmethodological strategies.  As such, the space currently occupied by culture-\neconomy divisions and reductions could be at least partially reconstructed by \ntreating concepts such as competition, markets, products and firms as both lived \nrealities and as formal categories (cf. Slater, 2002, 76). \n \nOn the other hand, suggestions that a growing \u201cculturalisation\u201d of the economy, \nin terms of both inputs to and outputs from production (see for example, Lash \nand Urry, 1994), has led to the economy becoming ontologically more cultural \nare misconceived and deeply problematic (Miller, 2002, 172-3). It is certainly true \nthat in some respects economic practices have become more sensitive to cultural \ndifferences and that corporations are increasingly aware of this and indeed have \nhelped promote it via advertising and in other ways as part of corporate \nstrategies to enhance profitability. Economic geographers (along with other social \nscientists) have certainly become more interested in studying these issues. \nHowever, to some perhaps considerable extent, this \u201ccultural turn\u201d in corporate \npractice is also an effect of the growing concern with these issues and the \ndiscursive construction of new forms of \u201ceconomy\u201d on the part of business \nconsultants, various \u201cThink Tanks\u201d and journalists, as well as academics in \nBusiness Schools (Thrift, 2005).  \n \nIndeed, this growing interest and proliferation of writing may be leading to a \nmistaken belief that these practices are more novel than they actually are. It is \nworth recalling Stuart Hall\u2019s (1991, 20) observation that \u201cwe suffer increasingly \nfrom a process of historical amnesia in which we think [that] just because we are \nthinking about an idea, it has only just started\u201d. This comes as a sharp reminder \nof the need for eternal vigilance to avoid the dangers of such amnesia and of \nconflating changes in academic fad and fashion with changes in the economy \nand its practices. In any case, the growth of corporate concern with \u201cculture\u201d \u2013 \nand the growing employment of anthropologists, cognitive psychologists and \n 16\nsociologists to deepen corporate understanding of these issues \u2013 is not new14 \nand is neither more nor less than part of capital\u2019s enduring concern to raise \nproductivity, increase sales and speed up the pace of accumulation more \ngenerally. In contrast, the task of critical geographers is to disclose and contest \nsuch moves rather than participate and glory in them.  \n \nMoreover, it is also important to acknowledge that, ontologically, Marxian political \neconomy was \u2013 and is \u2013 sensitive to issues of cultural difference in the \nconstitution of the economy in general and the capitalist economy in particular. \nNot least, this is the case in terms of its sensitivity to spatial difference and \nuneven development15. The concepts of mode of production and social formation \npoint precisely to this cultural and institutional constitution of capitalism as distinct \nfrom other modes of production and of varied capitalisms. What is required, \ntherefore, is to develop a culturally sensitive political economy that begins from \nthe assumption that the economy is - necessarily \u2013 always cultural but one that is \nalways alert to the power geometries and dynamics of political economy.  \nRecently, Bob Jessop (2004), building on earlier work (Jessop and Sum, 2001) \nhas further elaborated this point in arguing for a Marxist-inflected cultural political \neconomy by exploring the constitutive role of semiosis \u2013 the inter-subjective \nproduction of meaning - in economic and political activities and institutions and \nthe social order more generally. He argues that cultural political economy is a \n\u201cpost-disciplinary\u201d approach that adopts the \u201ccultural turn\u201d in economic and \npolitical inquiry without neglecting the articulation of semiosis with the inter-\nconnected materialities of economics and politics within wider social formations. \nThis suggests a fruitful way of further elaborating Marxian political economy in a \n\u201cpost-disciplinary\u201d context that speaks clearly to and is in sympathy with its \u201cpre-\ndisciplinary\u201d origins.  \n                                                 \n14 Consider, for example, the use of advances in psychology in the 1920s and 1930s in \nadvertising to construct new subjects (Williams, 1980) and Ford\u2019s establishment of its own \ncorporate Sociology Department (Beynon, 1973). \n15 It is worth noting that Marxian scholars have also been sensitive to issues of ethnicity and \ngender but have insisted that these be seen as related to \u2013 though not reducible to \u2013 class (see \nbelow). \n 17\n \n \nWeighing things up: towards a synthesis? \n \nIn summary, the strengths of the various approaches explored in the wake of \nMarxian political economy lie in the fact that they allow a fuller understanding of \nthe varied culturally and socially embedded forms that capitalist economic \ndevelopment can take, of how different forms of capitalism develop within the \nstructural parameters of the capitalist mode of production which Marxian political \neconomy allows us to establish quite precisely. That said, it is also important to \nbe aware of the dangers that engaging with such approaches may bring without \ndue care and attention to their potential weaknesses and the inflections that they \nmay give to understanding of the economy. For example, Gibson-Graham (1996, \n206) announces that \u201cthe way to begin to break free of capitalism is to turn its \nprevalent presentations on their head\u201d. As Allen Scott acerbically points (Scott, \n2004, 491): \u201dPresto. Not even a hint about a possible transitional programme \u2026 \nThe claim is presented in all its baldness, without any apparent consciousness \nthat attempts to break free of any given social system are likely to run into the \nstubborn realities of its indurated social and property relations as they actually \nexist.\u201d In arguing for a serious consideration of culture but against the \u201ccultural \nturn\u201d, Scott (2004, 491) goes on to suggest that quite apart from its \u201cdysfunctional \ndepreciation of the role of economic forces and structural logics in economic \ngeography, the cultural turn also opens a door to a disconcerting strain of \nphilosophical idealism and political voluntarism in modern geography\u201d16. It is \nprecisely such economic forces and structural logics that shape the \u201coften brutal \n                                                 \n16 Scott alludes here to what can be referred to as the rise of the \u201cpost-modern turn\u201d which denied \nthat theory and explanation were possible in any case. It is one thing to acknowledge a \u201ccrisis of \nrepresentation\u201d, quite another altogether to accept the nihilism of post-modernism and the view \nthat \u201canything goes\u201d, with all of the political implications that follow from this. In this context, I think \nit important to acknowledge that Amin and Thrift, for all their enthusiasm for theoretical and \npolitical variety \u201cdo not wish to defend an undifferentiated pluralism - - a kind of free-for-all Left \npolitics which is nothing more than an agonized liberalism\u201d (Amin and Thrift, 2005, 237).  \n 18\neconomically dominated world\u201d (Sayer, 1997, 25). And it is precisely such forces \nand logics that Marxian political economy allows us to understand better.  \n \nAt the end of the day, then, the key point is that Marxian political economy is still \nneeded to provide answers to the \u2018why\u2019 questions about capitalist economies, to \nreveal the inner mechanisms that drive the accumulation process that lies at the \nheart of the spatial and temporal dynamics of the economy and that delineate the \nlimits to capital. In addition, and importantly, Marxian political economy has an \nethical and moral register that foregrounds issues of inequality and injustice and \nthe ways in which these differentially affect people and places. Indeed, this \nethical and moral concern with inequality and injustice is central to it. We \ncontinue to need Marxian political economy in order to address these issues of \ninequality and to grasp the \u2018why\u2019 and not just the how, what and where of \ncapitalist economic geographies. Put another way, we discard Marxian political \neconomy at our peril, both theoretically and politically. \n \nOne attempt to acknowledge this while responding to some of the 1970s \ncriticisms of lack of scientific rigour was to produce mathematised versions of a \nMarxian political economy of the space economy (Barnes and Sheppard, 1989), \nechoing the approach to mathematising Marxism developed by Morishima (1973; \nMorishima and Catephores, 1978)17. While an impressive intellectual \nachievement in itself, this inevitably lead to the omission of consideration of a \nrange of qualitative influences and processes that were not amenable to \ntreatment in this way and in my judgement conceded too much to the critics \n(although see Plummer and Sheppard, 2001).  \n \nAs to other suggested alternative approaches, they describe and to a degree \naccount for the variety in forms of capitalist development. There is no inevitability \n                                                 \n17 Perhaps it was also influenced by the emergence of \u201canalytic Marxism\u201d, with its game theoretic \napproach (for example, Elster, 1985). However, such \u201canalytic Marxism\u201d approaches resort to a \nmethodological individualism that is very much at variance with the traditions of Marxian political \neconomy.  \n 19\nto the ways in which capitalism and its economic geographies evolve and it is \nvital to be able to comprehend how and why the space-time trajectories of \ncapitalist development, its historical geographies of uneven development, take \nthe forms that they do. This is fine as far it goes but it doesn\u2019t go far enough. For \nthe key point is that these remain forms of capitalist development \u2013 and Marxian \npolitical economy remains absolutely essential if we are properly to understand \nthe basic structural parameters and limits to capital within which this variety is \nnecessarily played out This was spelled out in unrivalled fashion by David Harvey \nin The Limits to Capital (1982) and this analysis remains as \u2013 if not more \u2013 \nrelevant than it did in the early 1980s18.   \n \n \nConclusions \n \nLet me begin the summing up by seeking to specify the reasons why many \ngeographers turned their face against the critical and radical tradition of Marxian \npolitical economy. In short, we can identify three sorts of reasons. \n \nFirstly, a genuine concern with the explanatory and theoretical limitations of \nvarious readings of Marxian political economy, arising from the perception of \nconceptual and ontological lacunae within it and concerns about its \nepistemological and methodological approach. For example, critics claimed that \nMarxian analyses were pre-occupied with class divisions and class-based \nidentities and neglected other dimensions of social division and identity such as \nethnicity and gender. While some sought to address these problems from within \nthe Marxian tradition (as indeed had been the case for some time: for example, \nsee Hartmann, 1979), others saw them as a reason to explore non-Marxian \nalternatives in the belief that these would provide more powerful and less \nproblematic explanations. \n                                                 \n18 As Noel Castree (2005) has recently emphasised, however, this is a necessary and not \nsufficient condition in terms of political strategy: there are limits to theory as well as to capital. \n 20\n \nSecondly, disciplinary sociologies \u2013 newly qualified geographers felt the need to \ncarve out and define their own intellectual territory, to \u201cdo something different\u201d \nfrom the existing orthodoxies and the old lags that peddle them (as some of us \nfelt about neoclassical location theories and theorists in the late 1960s and early \n1970s as we discovered Marxian political economy). This is neither surprising nor \nnecessarily unwelcome. After all, the engagement of differing and conflicting \nideas is what drives forward understanding and theory, as long as \u2013 and this is a \nkey caveat \u2013 this is not simply a fashion effect and change for the sake of change \nbecause \u201cnovelty is often valued for its own sake\u201d (M\u00e4ki, 2002, 130). However, it \nseems to me that quite a lot of the recent history of human geography can be \nconvincingly \u2013 and disturbingly - accounted via a narrative of novelty for its own \nsake; it has an authentic ring of truth. Indeed, \u201cnovelty for its own sake\u201d could \nwell be the leitmotif for the last decade or two and this is - or at least it ought to \nbe - a matter for some concern. \n \nThirdly, political correctness and \u201cinsidious careerism\u201d (Walker, 1989, 151) \u2013 for \nsome, engagement with Marxian political economy was seen as overtly political, \nand while no more so than an adherence to theories that underpinned orthodox \nconservative and right-wing positions, was always likely to be a contested \nposition in capitalist societies. This was particularly so with the rise of neo-\nliberalism from the 1970s, which in itself both registered and engendered \ndisarray among the political Left. For some, being seen to be Marxist was \nundoubtedly perceived as a career threatening move while for others having a go \nat Marxism was one way of establishing one\u2019s credentials as a safe bet, as \u201cone \nof us\u201d as Mrs. Thatcher might have put it.  \n \nNo doubt these \u2013 and other motives \u2013 became entangled in particular ways in \nparticular cases, but the net result was that Marxian political economy became \nsubject to a range of criticisms, as much from within as from outside  \u201cthe Left\u201d as \nthe pages of Antipode have revealed in some detail, and as a result no longer \n 21\nhad the air of authority that it once had. At the risk of repetition, let me be very \nclear about one point: I am certainly not claiming that Marxian political economy \nholds the answer to all the questions, theoretical and political, that we seek to \nresolve. To claim that it did would be to represent it as a totalising system and to \nover-extend its analytic reach. There are many aspects of capitalist political \neconomies and societies and their geographies that require different theoretical \nperspectives and approaches.  For example, issues of consumption (as opposed \nto exchange), as commodities become use values for those who have purchased \nthem, fall into this category, as do those aspects of human and social life that \nremain beyond the reach of processes of commodification19. Theoretical variety \nand complementarity are required precisely because of the complexity of the \npolitical economic geographies of capitalism (cf. Dow, 2002; M\u00e4ki, 2002) and in \nrecognition of the fact that \u201cthe concrete spatial world [is] a synthesis of many \ndeterminations \u2026 the outcome of a multiplicity of social dynamics operating at \ndifferent levels\u201d (Perrons, 2001, 211). I agree with this stance and have argued \nfor a pluri-theoretical approach that includes a range of other approaches as well \nas Marxian political economy precisely because of the complexity of and variety \nwithin capitalist economies (for example, see Hudson, 2001; 2004; 2005a)20. As \nsuch, I have no difficulty with Amin and Thrift\u2019s (2005, 226) suggestion that we \nneed to \u201callow many different theories of capitalism to flourish (from institutional \nand evolutionary economics to more modest experiments in cultural economy\u201d \nthough I have more difficulty than them with \u201cthe current obsession with \nSpinozian immanence\u201d. What I would insist on, however, is that if we are to let a \nthousand theoretical flowers bloom, then the hardy perennial of Marxian political \n                                                 \n19 Indeed, analysing and understanding such processes and their spaces may provide important \ninsights into ways of resisting or transforming capitalist relations in spaces on the margins of, or in \nthe interstices of, the mainstream capitalist economy (for example, see Amin et al, 2002; Leyshon \net al, 2003). But it is also important to recognise such alternatives and their spaces for what they \nare \u2013 and as things stand, they are diverse fragments that in no sense constitute a serious \nchallenge to the mainstream, and indeed in some ways their existence may unintentionally help \nlegitimate it, held up as evidence of tolerance of variety and difference by those in dominant \npositions.   \n20 Taking a different but related tack, others have suggested the need for a synthesis of different \napproaches (for example, Castree, 1999), \u201cin full cognizance of the reductionist dangers that it \nopens up\u201d (Scott, 2004, 492) but starting from a recognition of the existence of multiple theoretical \nperspectives. \n 22\neconomy must be one of them and economic geography \u2013 and indeed human \ngeography more generally - requires a continuing serious and open engagement \nwith it  \u201cin its many forms\u201d if it is to keep a radical and critical edge.  \n \nUnderstanding the spatialities and temporalities of capitalist economies requires \nthat we continue to recognise the value of Marxian political economy in helping \nunderstand why they are capitalist, the class structural relation that defines them \nas capitalist, and the limits to capital that constrain what is possible in such \nsocieties. A failure to acknowledge this seriously weakens any Left political \nstrategy. On the other hand, it is also the case that while this class relation is \ndecisive in defining of capitalist societies as capitalist, it certainly is not dominant \nin many empirical instances and a failure to acknowledge also this seriously \nweakens any Left political strategy. Of course there are many other dimensions \nof identity other than class (age, ethnicity, gender, nationality and so on) that are \ndominant in particular contexts \u2013 whether they become the basis of unity and \ncollective action or division and conflict remains a contingent matter \u2013 and, while \noften related to and inflected by class, these certainly cannot be reduced to \nclass.  \n \nAs Walker (1989) points out, however, while post-Marxist (I\u2019d prefer non-Marxist \nbut let\u2019s not split hairs) studies have thrown fresh light on issues such as \npatriarchy and racism, they lack a real radical edge precisely because, at best, \nthey establish tenuous links with economic realities and the power of dominant \nclasses. Indeed, the complex interplay of class with non-class dimensions of \nidentity results in the formation of complex political subjects that refuse to fit into \nclass structural categories as the structural classes of capital and labour are \nriven by a variety of cleavage planes. However, while there are multiple cleavage \nplanes that run through both the structural classes, these typically run more \ndeeply, widely and numerously through the structural class of labour than that of \ncapital, disabling any attempt by the former to act as a class \u201cfor itself\u201d and so \nposing a political challenge in terms of establishing bases for collective action \n 23\nthat challenges the imperatives of capital. Recognition of this complexity and the \nresultant often-subtle socio-spatial divisions is central to any attempt to forge \npractical Left political strategies; to pretend otherwise is naively idealistic, at best.  \n \nNonetheless, as I have suggested above, there is worrying evidence of an \napparent tendency to dismiss and deprecate the value of all versions of Marxian \napproaches, as the recent intervention by Ash Amin and Nigel Thrift illustrates. \nThis is unfortunate since it seems to me that there are many others (myself \nincluded) who would wish to argue for versions of Marxism that are entirely \nconsistent with the suggestion that they make (2005, 221) that our \u201cguiding \nprinciple\u201d should be \u201cthe promotion of emergence through the process of \ndisagreement\u201d. It seems to me entirely correct to argue that \u201cthe internal \ndynamics of capitalism\u201d have evolved in complex ways and that \u201cit becomes \nincreasingly difficult to read off determinate outcomes\u201d (Amin and Thrift, 2005, \n225 \u2013 but isn\u2019t this what a sophisticated and non-deterministic Marxian political \neconomy always recognised?21 By the same token, however, the object of \nanalysis remains capitalism and in that context Marxian political economy \ncontinues to offer absolutely essential theoretical tools and concepts that are \nneeded to understand capitalism and the limits to capital. It is one thing to \nrecognise the existence of dynamism and variety within the structural limits of \ncapitalist social relations, quite another to pretend that we can grasp and properly \ncomprehend these while abandoning the insights that Marxian political economy \nprovides in precisely delineating the parameters of and limits to capital. Indeed, \nwhile recognising that other social relations can have important determinate \neffects, it is vital to acknowledge that the domination of capital has both \nsignificantly deepened and extended over the last two decades (Harvey, 2003; \nArrighi, 2005). \n \n                                                 \n21 Equally, I have no problem with the observation that capitalist development has been shaped \nby \u201cnew articulations with non-capitalist social formations\u201d. I would merely observe that social \nformation is a good Althusserian concept and that there is a long Marxian history of analysing the \narticulation of capitalist and non-capitalist social formations.   \n 24\nDespite assertions to the contrary, then, neither History nor Geography have \nended and we continue to live in a capitalist world, dominated by capital. \nCertainly, this is a complex world and as a result we need a variety of theoretical \nperspectives in seeking to understand it and varied political strategies within a \nbroad Left project as we seek to change it fore the better. As it remains a \ncapitalist world, however, in the last instance the class structural power of capital \nasserts itself as decisive. Whether it ought to be decisive is of course another \nquestion. When it fails to be so, then capitalism will have been eclipsed, although \nthere is no sign that this is immanent. In the meantime, however, simply trying to \nwish away the structural power of capital is a curious theoretical and political \nstrategy for those on the Left \u2013 and one that is doomed to fail at the outset as the \nbasis for a radical and emancipatory politics. And as long as it remains the case \nthat we are grappling with the economic geographies of capitalism, we \u2013 as \ncritical geographers and radical citizens, who want to engage with the both the \n\u201csmall\u201d issues of injustice in everyday life and local places and the \u201cbig\u201d issues of \nglobal socio-spatial inequality and uneven development \u2013 have a deep and \nenduring need for Marxian political economy.  That simple fact is staring us in the \nface. How absurd to pretend otherwise. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThis paper began life as a seminar presented to the Department Of Geography, \nUniversity of Strathclyde in May 2000, and underwent subsequent \ntransformations before this version was prepared as a result of an invitation to \ndeliver the Antipode Lecture at the 2005 Annual Conference of the Royal \nGeographical Society with the Institute of British Geographers. My thanks to the \neditors of Antipode for their invitation to give the Lecture. In addition, Noel \nCastree, Costis Hadjimichalis and Roger Lee very helpfully commented previous \nversions of this paper and I am extremely grateful to them for this. Responding to \ntheir comments has greatly improved the paper. Ash Amin and Nigel Thrift also \n 25\nkindly commented on the penultimate version \u2013 we continue to differ on some \nthings but remain good friends nonetheless. As ever, I remain responsible for the \ncontinuing shortcomings of the paper.  \n \n \nReferences \n \nAlthusser L and Balibar E, 1970, Reading Capital, New Left Books, London. \n \nAlthusser L, 1977, For Marx, New Left Books, London. \n \nAmin A, 1999, \u201cAn institutionalist perspective on regional development\u201d, \nInternational Journal of Urban and Regional Development , 23, 365-378.  \n \nAmin A, Cameron A and Hudson R, 2002, Placing the Social Economy, \nRoutledge, London. \n \nAmin A and Thrift N, 2000, \u201cWhat kind of economic theory for what kind of \neconomic geography?\u201d, Antipode, 32, 4-9. \n \nAmin A and Thrift N, 2005, \u201cWhat\u2019s Left?
