The considerations are\napplicable to all concerned with online learning and indeed anyone seeking to trade, disseminate\ninformation and mediate services online. In reflecting on the Open University experience of making\nonline material accessible, pedagogic, organisational and cultural issues are highlighted and it is\nargued that it is important to address these issues in order to effect the organisational change needed\nto ensure that accessibility challenges are effectively met.\nIntroduction\nIn order to provide a context for the author\u2019s reflections on the Open University (OU)\nexperience of making online material accessible, three key areas will be introduced: \n\u25cf The accessibility context: what is accessibility and why it is important?\n\u25cf The UK legislative context.\n\u25cf The Open University context.\nThe accessibility context: what is accessibility and why is it important?\nAccessibility is a term that has particular meanings in different contexts; here it refers\nto design qualities that endeavour to make online learning available to all by ensuring\nthat the way it is implemented does not create unnecessary barriers however the\nstudent may interact with their computer. Virtually anyone, irrespective of any\ndisability, can be enabled to interact effectively with a computer. Some people with\n*Institute of Educational Technology (IET), Walton Hall, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, UK. Email:\nm.cooper@open.ac.uk\n104 M. Cooper\ndisabilities interact with the computer using methods other than the conventional\nmonitor, keyboard and mouse; some require special tools, usually referred to as \u2018assis-\ntive technology\u2019; and some need the way content is presented to them by the\ncomputer to be appropriate to their needs (e.g. in terms of font sizes and\/or colour\ncontrast). There are well-established principles in how to promote accessibility in\nsoftware design and electronic content (IMS Global Learning Consortium, 2002;\nCooper, 2003). These promote compatibility with assistive technology and ensure\nthat different ways of interacting with the computer can be accommodated.\nIt is pertinent to pause at this point and reflect on what we are seeking to promote\nin addressing the accessibility agenda in e-learning; that is, access to what? Funda-\nmentally it is the teaching and learning offered that needs to be made accessible.\nHowever, if a disabled student is to fully participate in their course and university life,\naccessibility must include all aspects of the interaction between the student and the\ninstitution. This includes registration, teaching and learning, examinations and other\nforms of assessment, study support, pastoral care and community building. Then we\nshould consider the question: access for whom? Essentially the answer is \u2018access for\nall students\u2019, including students and potential students with a disability; covering all\ntypes of disability\u2014physical, sensory, specific learning disabilities including dyslexia,\nmental health and hidden disabilities such as chronic fatigue, and so on. If you fail to\naddress issues of accessibility, you will exclude or disadvantage significant numbers\nof people: \n\u25cf Disabled people represent about 10\u201315% of the general population.\n\u25cf Among OU students, 5.5% declare a disability.\n\u25cf Recent Microsoft-commissioned market research (Microsoft, 2004) shows that\n57% of working-age computer users are likely to benefit from accessible technology\n(where accessible technology is understood as technical responses to promote\naccess for disabled people to computer hardware and software).\nGood design for disabled people is good design for all. Considering the needs of\ndisabled students facilitates reflection on the interactions that support the learning\nobjectives, and addressing the accessibility agenda promotes usability for all.\nIn its work developing international standards for metadata that enable automatic\nsystems-based approaches to accessibility in e-learning, the IMS Accessibility Work-\ning Group1 (now IMS AccSIG) re-defined disability in the e-learning context as a\nmismatch between the education offered and the needs and preferences of the learner\n(IMS Global Learning Consortium, 2004). Disability is therefore not a personal trait,\nbut an artefact of the relationship between the learner and the learning environment\nor education delivery. Accessibility, given this re-definition, is the ability of the learn-\ning environment to adjust to the needs of all learners. Accessibility is determined by\nthe flexibility of the e-learning system (with respect to presentation, control methods,\naccess modality and learner support) and the availability of adequate alternative-but-\nequivalent content and activities. The needs and preferences of a user may arise from\nthe context or environment the user is in, the tools available (e.g. assistive technolo-\ngies such as Braille devices, voice recognition systems, or alternative keyboards, etc.),\nMaking online learning accessible to disabled students 105\ntheir background or a disability in the traditional sense. Metadata-based systems\nresponses to the accessibility agenda is beyond the scope of this paper. For those who\nare interested, please see the IMS AccessForAll Overview Document (IMS Global\nConsortium, 2004).\nThe UK legislative context\nMany countries are introducing legislation, making it illegal to discriminate against\ndisabled people in education. In the United Kingdom the key legislation is the Special\nEducational Needs and Disability Act 2001 (HMSO, 2001). This amends the 1995\nDisability Discrimination Act (DDA) (HMSO, 1995) and now constitutes DDA Part\n4. This Act legislates that education providers must not treat a disabled person less\nfavourably for any reason that relates to the person\u2019s disability. Furthermore, the\neducation provider is required to make reasonable adjustments to enable a disabled\nperson to participate in its courses. Access to the online elements of its courses is an\nimportant area where, by considering the needs of disabled students, discrimination\ncan be prevented. Furthermore, it is where, if necessary, reasonable adjustments can\nreadily be made to meet the diverse needs of students with disabilities. An important\nfeature of the Act is that the needs of disabled students need to be anticipated and\nthat it is therefore not sufficient for an educational establishment just to attempt to\ndeal with the needs of a disabled student as they arise. This is important because\nwhere this has been past practice, the needs of disabled students have often been\npoorly met, because of lack of forward thinking. Mason and Casserle (2005) offer a\nuseful review of key DDA and web accessibility cases (although not specifically\nrelated to education).\nReasonable adjustments.   The term \u2018reasonable adjustment\u2019 is used widely in the DDA\nPart 4, and it begs the question \u2018what is reasonable?\u2019 This is a moot point and one\nthat almost has to be considered on a case-by-case basis. However, the act is\nsupported by a Code of Practice (Disability Rights Commission, 2004) that gives\nexamples of the types of activity that should be considered and may require adjust-\nment. Reasonable adjustments should be made to make all learning activities\naccessible to disabled students. This includes all learning materials: paper-based,\nweb-based or computer-based, videos, audio, and so on. If this is not possible for\nsome reason, alternative learning activities should be provided. Returning to the\nquestion \u2018what is reasonable?\u2019, the Code of Practice has a section offering guidance\nhere. Some of the factors that might be taken into account when considering what is\nreasonable include the following: \n\u25cf the need to maintain academic and other prescribed standards;\n\u25cf the financial resources available to the responsible body;\n\u25cf grants or loans likely to be available to disabled students (and only disabled\nstudents) for the purpose of enabling them to receive student services, such as\nDisabled Students\u2019 Allowances;\n106 M. Cooper\n\u25cf the cost of taking a particular step;\n\u25cf the extent to which it is practicable to take a particular step;\n\u25cf the extent to which aids or services will otherwise be provided to disabled people\nor students;\n\u25cf health and safety requirements; and\n\u25cf the relevant interests of other people including other students.\nIt is up to each higher educational establishment to determine how it responds to this\nlegislation across its institution. Key issues in this response are whose responsibility is\naccessibility and how are decisions about reasonable adjustments made and recorded.\nThe Open University context\nThe OU is Europe\u2019s largest educational establishment, with the vast majority of its\ncourses being delivered predominantly at a distance. The OU has invested \u00a330 million\nin e-learning over the seven-year period to the end of 2004. Investment continues with\na \u00a35 million Virtual Learning Environment project and further substantial investment\nin an Enterprise Content Management System is ongoing. It seeks to pay appropriate\nregard to accessibility issues in these developments with two specific goals: \n\u25cf Leveraging the potential of these technologies\/systems to improve the effectiveness\nand efficiency with which the university can meet the needs of its disabled students.\n\u25cf Ensuring that these developments do not introduce additional barriers to learning\nfor students with disabilities.\nThe OU has a commitment to: \n\u25cf widening access to higher education by helping students to overcome barriers to\ntheir study;\n\u25cf providing high-quality, interactive educational materials that meet students\u2019 needs;\nand\n\u25cf operating within the over-arching mission of \u2018openness to all\u2019.\nThe OU\u2019s extensive experience in production and delivery of large-scale e-learning\nis demonstrated by the following statistics: \n\u25cf About 200,000 OU students and their tutors (8000) have been given an account\non the university\u2019s email and computer conferencing system. This conferencing\nsystem is used extensively in the delivery of most courses and is the basis of much\nof the contact between students, their peers and their tutor between the typically\nmonthly face-to-face tutorial that is part of the delivery of many courses.\n\u25cf 106,000 OU assignments annually (one in eight of all assignments) are submitted\nelectronically.\n\u25cf About 17 of the university\u2019s 400 courses are wholly \u2018online\u2019. Another 190 require\nthe student to have online access (for delivery of course materials, study support,\netc.); the remaining courses provide online services for the students to access if\nthey wish.\nMaking online learning accessible to disabled students 107\nThe OU currently has about 10,000 disabled students, approximately one-half of\nwhom receive some particular support from the university to enable them to partici-\npate in their studies. The university is committed to making its online educational\ncontent and student services accessible to disabled students, but the scale of this\npresents a challenge.\nThe OU experience of making online materials accessible\nThe OU experience of making online materials accessible raises important questions\nand highlights pertinent issues: \n\u25cf Who is responsible for accessibility?\n\u25cf What are we seeking to make accessible?\n\u25cf What educators should know about accessibility.\nThese issues will now be addressed in turn.\nWhose responsibility?\nThe issue of responsibility for accessibility is often helpfully thought of in the same\nway that responsibility in health and safety legislation is considered. The ultimate\nresponsibility lies with the governing body of the institution. This responsibility is\ndevolved by them to specific named individuals or posts across the organisation;\nhowever, all employees have a responsibility for health and safety. So in the case of\naccessibility to online learning, all involved in its conception, implementation and\ndelivery have a responsibility for its accessibility. However, specific responsibilities\nshould be given to key people. Within the OU, the teams that develop each course\n(and ultimately the Deans of Faculties) are responsible for the accessibility of their\ncourses. How this responsibility is handled within each course team is left to them to\norganise. It is recommended that they appoint one of their members to take specific\nresponsibility for ensuring that accessibility issues are properly addressed. This\nperson may or may not be the course team chair. All course team decisions on\naccessibility and reasonable adjustments should be documented, and a protocol has\nbeen established for doing this within the formal course development process. It is\nimportant to record the rationale for these decisions, both as part of the internal\nmanagement of course development and because it is these decisions that could be\nsubject to legal challenge under DDA Part 4. Furthermore, it is important to inform\ndisabled students ahead of their enrolment on a course of any particular accessibility\nissues that elements of the course may present them and where they may be offered\nan alternative activity.\nIt is also important to clearly establish the division of responsibilities between the\neducators devising the course and the developers implementing its software and web-\nbased components.\nAt the OU it has been argued that accessibility is intrinsically linked to the learning\nobjectives; the author would assert this is the case in all e-learning irrespective of\n108 M. Cooper\ninstitutional context (see the following section). Hence, the approach taken at the OU\nis that it is the educators\u2019 responsibility to specify the accessibility criteria but the\ndevelopers\u2019 responsibility to determine how these are met in the technology they\nemploy. In reality these responsibilities are acted out in iterative discussions between\neducators and developers.\nThere are several specialist units within the OU that support different aspects of the\nuniversity\u2019s work in meeting the needs of disabled students. These include the Office\nfor Students with Disabilities, the Curriculum Access team within Disabled Student\nServices (DSS-CA), and the Accessibility in Educational Media (AEM) team within\nthe Institute of Educational Technology, which the author heads.\nEvery student receives support from a Regional Office and has a tutor, now known\nas an Associate Lecturer. Associate Lecturers and Regional Disability Advisors have\nan important role to play in supporting disabled students and mediating between the\nstudent and the rest of the OU when an adjustment is required that has not been\nanticipated. Students themselves also have responsibilities including making their\nneeds known.\nIt is important to note that the primary responsibility for accessibility in courses is\nnot devolved to these specialist units, but remains with the teams developing the\ncourses. However these units support the roles of the course teams in different ways.\nThe Curriculum Access team within Disabled Student Services and the AEM have\ncollaborated in delivering an extensive staff development programme designed to\nensure that all faculties and their staff realise their responsibilities in response to DDA\nPart 4. They also have a significant internal consultancy role with course teams and\nthe developers working with them. This covers the accessibility issues raised by\ndifferent elements in their courses, including their web presence and other use of\ncomputers in activities central to their course. This role includes validating that acces-\nsibility approaches adopted have in fact successfully met the needs of disabled\nstudents. Thus course teams and their developers can call upon specialist support at\nall stages of the development of online components: conceptualisation and specifica-\ntion; evaluation of early prototypes and evaluation of final developments before they\nare released.\nWhat are we seeking to make accessible?\nSo often in accessibility considerations of educational websites or software the focus\nis on how best to make a particular element technically accessible to disabled\nstudents. However, the author maintains that educators need to stand back from\nthese considerations and remember that, fundamentally, what we are seeking to make\naccessible is the learning. This may seem an obvious statement but it is often missed,\nand is key to deciding what is the most appropriate response to meet the needs of\ndisabled students. Thus, fundamental to accessibility considerations in online educa-\ntion is having clearly established learning objectives. This is important through\ndifferent degrees of granularity from the overall learning objectives for the course to\nthe learning objectives for the individual activities being mediated online. By analogy,\nMaking online learning accessible to disabled students 109\nit is the case when considering the accessibility of any online service that it is the\nobjectives of that service that must be referred to in determining the best way to make\nit accessible, and not in the first place the technology envisaged as being used to\nimplement that service.\nAn important concept in accessibility is that of alternative presentation or equiva-\nlent activity. Often a decision has to be made as to whether accessibility is best\nachieved for a particular group of disabled students by presenting the same element\nin a different way (e.g. by using a detailed text description of a set of data instead of\na graph for visually impaired students, or whether a totally different although educa-\ntionally equivalent activity is more appropriate). It is the learning objectives that need\nto be referred to as the basis of such decisions.\nAn example from experience at the OU that illustrates this is on a programming\ncourse that uses a specific programming environment, which is inaccessible to some\ndisabled students. If the learning objectives are to learn a particular programming\nlanguage, students could use an alternative (equivalent) programming environment\nthat is accessible. However, this would not be appropriate if the objectives are to learn\nto use that specific programming environment. If the latter is the case, then a clear\nrationale must be agreed as to why this particular programming environment is so\nimportant to the objectives of the course. A further example from an assessment issue\non an OU course is where a video is used showing a conversation between a social\nworker and a child. If the learning objective is to appreciate that non-verbal commu-\nnication takes place, and the assessment requires the student to describe the body\nlanguage, then an alternative activity and assessment should be devised for blind\nstudents.\nSituations where visual or auditory discernment form part of the learning objective\npresent particular challenges when deciding how best to make them accessible to\nthose with a significant impairment in the relevant sense. The standard approach of\nincluding an equivalent text description or transcription is often not appropriate here.\nThis is because it is difficult to construct these textual equivalents in such a way that\nthey still meet the sensory discernment aspects of the learning objectives. Basically,\nthe issue is how to construct a description that does not simply \u2018give the answer away\u2019.\nThis can make it difficult to create a description that is effective in promoting the\nlearning of the skill one is seeking to develop in the student. In such cases, how the\nlearning objectives of this particular activity relate to the overall learning objectives of\nthe course should be considered. Often the appropriate response is to develop an\nalternative activity that has an equivalent weight of contribution to these overall\nobjectives in the same basic area as problematic activity but does not include the\nsensory discernment objectives. However, it must be accepted that there are funda-\nmental limits to accessibility.\nWhat educators should know about accessibility\nAll educators need not become accessibility experts, although some might do this and\nsupport colleagues in this area. However, all educators need to have an appreciation\n110 M. Cooper\nof the issues and an overview of how disabled students may select to make effective\nuse of the computer. This general level of knowledge about the area is important in\navoiding the \u2018assumption of limitation\u2019. This can be illustrated by the comments that\neducators are sometime heard to make, of the type: \u2018I don\u2019t think a blind person could\npossibly do this\u2019. Sometimes they may think this because they have little knowledge\nof coping strategies adopted by blind people or technological or human support avail-\nable to them. A blind person might readily be able to do the task in question, say with\nthe aid of their assistive technology, if the appropriate response is made in the devising\nof that task.\nThis general awareness of accessibility is also important in ensuring that accessibility\nissues are addressed at the right time, at the conceptualisation and specification stage\nof a component in online learning, not just discovered once the learning object has\nbeen developed. It is a too frequent frustration to those working in accessibility that\nthey are repeatedly presented with situations where they are asked to comment on the\naccessibility of an online component once it is developed. Often widespread accessi-\nbility could have been readily achieved if it had been considered at the outset, but now\nonly limited accessibility can be achieved because of time, technical or cost constraints.\nMeeting the accessibility agenda does incur costs but these costs are significantly lower\nif accessibility is considered from the outset rather than looking for a fix after the major-\nity of the development work has been done. By giving all educators who might originate\nor specify online course components a general awareness of accessibility, they can be\ntrained to at least ask the right questions about accessibility at the early stages even if\nthey do not know the answers.\nA brief overview of the accessibility information that it has been judged as impor-\ntant for educators at the OU to know is now presented. This is considered from both\nends of the problem; firstly how disabled people use a computer and what assistive\ntechnology they may elect to use; and then what response is required by those devel-\noping online learning components to ensure it is compatible with the way that\ndisabled students may be seeking to access these.\nAssistive technology.   Virtually all disabled people can be enabled to make effective\nuse of a computer. Some disabled students use accessibility features provided by the\noperating systems of the computer and\/or specialist software or hardware to facilitate\ntheir use of the computer. These software or hardware tools are often referred to\ncollectively as \u2018assistive technology\u2019.2 If it is to be accessible to disabled students, any\nsoftware or educational content mediated by the computer has to be developed so\nthat it is compatible with these tools. It is important that all educators have an over-\nview of how disabled students may use a computer and the implications of this for any\nsoftware or web content they commission or develop.\nThe sort of level of detail most educators would need to know about assistive tech-\nnology can be contained within a two-hour to three-hour staff development session.\nExperience at the OU has shown that such sessions have far more impact if different\nexamples of assistive technology can be effectively demonstrated. There is a further\nMaking online learning accessible to disabled students 111\nissue that an educational institution needs to consider, and that is how students are\nsupported in selecting and being trained in the use of the most appropriate assistive\ntechnology to support their studies. This is usually the domain of student support\nservices or IT support staff who may call on services of Access or Assessment\nCentres.3 The OU has established its own Access Centre in Milton Keynes, has a\nmobile facility known as the Access Bus, and uses the services of other Access Centres\nwhere this is more appropriate to the student\u2019s location.\nIt is generally unhelpful to consider medical classifications of disability when seek-\ning to identify the means of enabling people with disabilities to make efficient use of\nthe computer. It is preferable to consider the abilities, and disabilities, of the individ-\nual with respect to what they need to do to make most effective use of the computer;\nin other words, to take a functional approach. The functions to be considered fall into\ntwo broad categories: \n1. How the person may best input commands and information into the computer\n(here most computer users use the keyboard and mouse).\n2. How the person receives the output from the computer (for most computer users\nthis will generally be the monitor, but also includes loudspeakers and printers).\nAccessible online content.   There are extensive guidelines and software tools to support\ndevelopers in producing accessible web content and other software that might be\npresented online. It is probably sufficient for educators to know that these resources\nexist but an understanding of the underlying accessibility principles will help them in\ntheir role and in managing the balance of responsibilities for accessibility between the\ncommissioning educator and the developer.\nThe World Wide Web Consortium creates web standards. Under its Web Accessi-\nbility Initiative (WAI) it has drawn up extensive guidelines for creating webpages that\nare accessible to many people with a disability. It should be noted that these are\nguidelines to presenting information in an accessible way on the Web, and further\nresources may be needed when seeking to address some of the accessibility issues in\ninteractive educational software. There are, for example, specific accessibility\nguidelines for particular programming languages that may be used to implement\neducational software (e.g. JAVA4).\nThe WAI guidelines, usually referred to as Web Content Accessibility Guidelines,\ncan certainly at first sight appear complex and there are issues about how to best\nsupport developers in using them, but these are beyond the scope of this paper. There\nare 14 guidelines, each of which is associated with one or more checkpoints describing\nhow to apply that guideline to particular features in webpages (WAI, 1999). Each\ncheckpoint is assigned one of three \u2018priority\u2019 levels reflecting the impact that not\nfollowing it will have on accessibility. Levels of conformance are then specified against\nthese priorities. It is recommended that an educational website seeking to meet the\nneeds of disabled students, and its obligations under DDA Part 4, should aim for\n\u2018Double-A\u2019 conformance, which means meeting all priority one and priority two\ncheckpoints. This is in line with what is generally deemed to be accessible in various\n112 M. Cooper\ncontexts across Europe. It should be noted, however, that it is perfectly possible for\nan e-learning website to be technically accessible (i.e. to meet all priority one and\npriority two checkpoints), but not to be able to facilitate the achieving of its learning\nobjectives for some disabled users. Technical accessibility needs to be considered\nalongside usability and pedagogy in determining whether the learning objectives of a\nparticular e-learning resource can be accessed by all learners.\nMost websites and webpages are produced using authoring tools rather than \u2018hand\ncrafting\u2019 hypertext mark-up (e.g. HTML). There is a high degree of variability in how\nreadily these tools support authoring in a way that conforms to the accessibility guide-\nlines. However, in response to US legislation, most of the major suppliers of such\ntools are seeking to address this in recent and planned releases.\nUnderlying principles of software accessibility\nA summary of the main accessibility principles that the author believes staff in higher\neducation need to know is presented here. It is recommended that all educators are\ncognisant of these to enable them to effectively take on their responsibilities for acces-\nsibility in the design of web and software course components. \n\u25cf Allow for user customisation. Many different disabled people, including those with a\nvisual impairment and dyslexia, find online content can be made more readable if\nthey are able to choose particular font styles and sizes and use different background\nand foreground colours. Because of the wide diversity in what different people\nwould select as their optimally readable configuration, this is best addressed by\nallowing them to configure these. This is usually most readily done by enabling the\nwebpages or software to inherit user set parameters from the browser or computer\noperating system.\n\u25cf Provide equivalent visual and auditory content and interface elements. Text is the most\nreadily accessible form of online content. It can be rendered into synthetic speech\nby screen readers and configured for different presentation. Text descriptions\nshould be provided for all images, graphics and video content, transcriptions\nprovided of auditory content, and text labelling of interface elements included.\n\u25cf Provide compatibility with assistive technologies. This simple statement hides a\nmultitude of technical issues but, by following set web or software standards, the\nopportunities for this being adequately addressed are maximised as the assistive\ntechnologies are to a large part developed with these same standards in mind.\n\u25cf Allow access to all functionality from the keyboard alone. Many disabled people are\nunable to or prefer not to use a mouse. This includes blind people and those with\nsome physical disabilities. By ensuring that software can be fully used without a\nmouse, the needs of these users are met\u2014but also generally more efficient interac-\ntion with the software is offered to all users.\n\u25cf Provide context and orientation information. It is important to consider the accessibil-\nity issues of navigating around the content as well as the content itself. This is an\noften neglected area. Support should be provided for efficient navigation by\nMaking online learning accessible to disabled students 113\ninforming the user of where they are, taking into account that some users may be\nusing screen readers or other assistive technologies. This is another case where\nthinking about the needs of disabled users often yields benefits for all users by\npromoting usability generally.\nConclusion\nLegislation now directs that online learning should be made accessible to disabled\nstudents, and most educational establishments would aspire to this from their own\nethos. However, to achieve this requires cultural change across the organisation. I\nhave reflected on the process of promoting this cultural change within the OU. The\nimportance of being clear about roles and responsibilities in promoting accessibility\nhas been stated and the centrality of the educators\u2019 role in this has been argued. They\nof course need to be provided with the necessary expert support to enable them to\ntake on this responsibility.\nThe fundamental importance of the learning objectives in establishing accessibil-\nity criteria and in identifying and making adjustments to online course components\nto meet the needs of disabled students has also been highlighted. This is a key\npoint. It is from this that the centrality of the educators\u2019 role follows. The knowl-\nedge that educators need to know about accessibility issues to enable them to\nperform this role has been outlined. This has been the basis of the staff and\nprofessional development programme in response to DDA Part 4, enacted at the\nOU across all its faculties, and such an approach would be commended to other\ninstitutions.\nAcknowledgements\nThe author would like to thank all within the OU, and elsewhere, who have informed\nhis thinking on these issues over the years. In the preparation of this paper, the author\nwould particularly like to thank Mary Taylor, a colleague in the AEM team in the\nInstitution of Educational Technology at the OU, who proof-read the text and made\nsuggestions for its improvement, and Peter Wilson of the Policy Development Group,\nwho supplied the current data about the status of e-learning in the OU.\nNotes\n1.
