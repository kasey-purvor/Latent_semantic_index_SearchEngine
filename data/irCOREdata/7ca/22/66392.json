De Fazioa and M.R. Penningtonb\na Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare, Sezione di Bari, Italy\nb Institute for Particle Physics Phenomenology, University of Durham,\nDH1 3LE, Durham, UK\nAbstract\nWe consider the radiative transition \u03c6 \u2192 f0\u03b3, which is a sensitive probe\nof the nature of the f0(980) particle. Using the QCD sum-rule technique,\nwe estimate the branching ratio of such decay mode to be: B(\u03c6 \u2192 f0\u03b3) =\n(2.7 \u00b1 1.1) 10\u22124, in fair agreement with present experimental data. As for\nthe structure of the f0, the result suggests a sizeable ss\u00af component; however,\nthis result does not exclude the possibility of further components and allows\na more complex structure than indicated by the naive quark model.\nThe quark model provides a rather good description of hadrons, which fit into suitable\nmultiplets reasonably well. In its simplest version the model then interprets mesons as\npure qq states. Scalar mesons present a remarkable exception to this successful scheme.\nIndeed, the nature of these mesons is not established yet [1]. There are more scalars\nthan can fit into one quark model multiplet. Consequently, some of these states could\nbe either glueballs or admixtures of quark and gluonic states, or belong to multiquark\nmultiplets. A particular feature of some of these particles is that they appear to be rather\nwide [2, 3, 4, 5]. They have very short lifetimes and large couplings to hadronic channels,\nsuch as KK or \u03c0\u03c0. This might suggest that they can be identified as composite systems\nof hadrons, or that they spend an appreciable part of their lifetimes as such states. This\ncould be the result of hadronic dressing, whereby the strong interaction enriches a qq state\nwith other components such as\n\u2223\u2223\u2223KK\u232a, |\u03c0\u03b7\u3009, etc. Such a viewpoint could also explain why\nthe scalar mesons seem to contradict the OZI rule. Since the two mesons composing the\nstate in which they spend much of their lifetime may readily annihilate to qq, leading to\na subsequent OZI allowed decay.\nIn this letter, we focus on the structure of the f0(980) and the possibility of gleaning\ninformation about this from radiative \u03c6 decays. According to the quark model, the f0(980)\nshould be an ss state, an interpretation supported in Refs. [6, 7, 8]. However, this does\nnot explain its mass degeneracy with the a0(980), that should be a (uu\u2212 dd)\/\n\u221a\n2 state.\nThere are also suggestions that the f0(980) could be a four quark qqqq state [9]. In this\ncase, it could either be nucleon-like [10], i.e. a bound state of quarks with symbolic\nquark structure ss(uu+ dd)\/\n\u221a\n2 1, or deuteron-like, i.e. a bound state of hadrons, which\nis usually referred to as a KK molecule [2, 11, 12, 13]. In the former of these two\npossibilities, the mesons are treated as point-like objects, while in the latter they should\nbe considered as extended objects. Some objections have been raised against the KK\nmolecular model [2, 14]. In particular, such an interpretation requires a width smaller\nthan the binding energy of the molecule itself, which has been estimated to be \u01eb \u2243 10\u221220\nMeV [2], in contrast to the measured width lying in the range 40\u2212 100 MeV [15].\nVarious ways have been suggested of clarifying the situation, such as the analysis of\nthe f0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decay [16, 17] or of the ratio \u0393(\u03c6\u2192 a0\u03b3)\n\u0393(\u03c6\u2192 f0\u03b3) [11]. In the naive quark model,\nfor example, it is expected that B(\u03c6 \u2192 f0\u03b3) and B(\u03c6 \u2192 a0\u03b3) would differ by a factor of\n10. Moreover the rate for \u03c6\u2192 f0\u03b3 may distinguish among the different possibilities [11],\n1Within the same framework the isovector partner a0(980) is written as ss(uu + dd)\/\n\u221a\n2.\n2\nsince, according to the existing theoretical estimates, the expected branching ratio would\nbe as high as 10\u22124 in the qqqq case, O(10\u22125) in the ss case. For a KK molecule, the\nbranching ratio clearly depends on its size. For a compact state this is \u223c 7 \u00b7 10\u22125, while\nfor a diffuse, deuteron-like system, it is down below 10\u22125 [11].\nFrom the experimental point of view, the PDG value [15]:\nB(\u03c6\u2192 f0\u03b3) = (3.4\u00b1 0.4) 10\u22124 (1)\nstems from averaging the results of the CMD2 [18] and SND [19] collaborations, analysing\n\u03c0+\u03c0\u2212\u03b3, \u03c00\u03c00\u03b3 and 5\u03b3 final states. What is more, a significant improvement is expected\nat the \u03c6 factory DA\u03a6NE [20], where the first results give:\nB(\u03c6\u2192 f0\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c00\u03c00\u03b3) = (0.81\u00b1 0.09(stat)\u00b1 0.06(syst))\u00d7 10\u22124 (2)\nand\nB(\u03c6\u2192 f0\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c0\u2212\u03c0+\u03b3) < 1.64\u00d7 10\u22124 (3)\nat 90% C.L. [21].\nThe present letter is devoted to analysis of the radiative decay \u03c6 \u2192 f0\u03b3 using QCD\nsum-rules [22], which we previously applied to the radiative \u03c6 transitions to \u03b7, \u03b7\u2032 [23].\nThat the f0(980) couples significantly through ss components has long been known\n2\nfrom its appearance as a peak in J\/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6f0 [25] and Ds \u2192 \u03c0f0 [26], as discussed in\nRefs. [3], and in more detail in [27]. Our calculation relies on the assumed coupling of\nthe f0 to the scalar ss density. As a preliminary, we evaluate the strength of this coupling\nusing two point QCD sum-rules. The result will then be exploited in the three point QCD\nsum-rule evaluation of the relevant quantity needed to compute B(\u03c6\u2192 f0\u03b3).\nThe coupling of the f0(980) to the scalar current J\ns = ss can be parametrized in terms\nof a constant f\u02dc :\n\u30080| Js |f0(p)\u3009 = mf0 f\u02dc . (4)\nIn order to compute this parameter by QCD sum-rules, we consider the two-point corre-\nlator:\nT (q2) = i\n\u222b\nd4xeiq\u00b7x \u30080|T [Js(x)Js\u2020(0)] |0\u3009 , (5)\n2And noticed more recently by Delbourgo et al. [24] for \u03c6\u2192 f0\u03b3.\n3\nwhich is given by the dispersive representation:\nT (q2) =\n1\n\u03c0\n\u222b \u221e\n4m2s\nds\n\u03c1(s)\ns\u2212 q2 + subtractions . (6)\nIn the region of low values of s, the physical spectral density contains a \u03b4\u2212function term\ncorresponding, in the small width approximation, to the coupling of the f0 to the scalar\ncurrent. Picking up this contribution and dropping possible subtractions which we discuss\nlater, we can write:\nT (q2) =\nm2f0 f\u02dc\n2\nm2f0 \u2212 q2\n+\n1\n\u03c0\n\u222b \u221e\ns0\nds\n\u03c1had(s)\ns\u2212 q2 , (7)\nassuming that the contribution of higher resonances and continuum of states start from\nan effective threshold s0. On the other hand, the correlator T (q\n2) can be computed in\nQCD for large Euclidean values of q2, by using the Operator Product Expansion (OPE)\nto expand the T -product in Eq. (5) as the sum of a perturbative contribution plus non-\nperturbative terms which are proportional to vacuum expectation values of quark and\ngluon gauge-invariant operators of increasing dimension, the so called vacuum conden-\nsates. In practice, only a few condensates are included, the most important contributions\ncoming from the dimension 3 < qq > and dimension 5 < qg\u03c3Gq >.\nIn the QCD expression for the two-point correlator considered, the perturbative term\ncan also be written dispersively, so that:\nTQCD(q2) =\n1\n\u03c0\n\u222b \u221e\n4m2s\nds\n\u03c1pert(s)\ns\u2212 q2 + d3 < ss > +d5 < sg\u03c3Gs > +... , (8)\nwhere the spectral function \u03c1pert and the coefficients d3, d5 can be computed in QCD. The\nnext step consists in assuming quark-hadron duality, which amounts to the claim that the\nphysical and the perturbative spectral densities give the same result when integrated\nappropriately above some s0. This leads to the sum-rule:\nm2f0 f\u02dc\n2\nm2f0 \u2212 q2\n=\n1\n\u03c0\n\u222b s0\n4m2s\nds\n\u03c1pert(s)\ns\u2212 q2 + d3 < ss > +d5 < sg\u03c3Gs > + . . . (9)\nThis expression can be improved by applying to both sides of Eq. (9) a Borel transform,\ndefined as follows:\nB[F(Q2)] = lim\nQ2\u2192\u221e, n\u2192\u221e, Q\n2\nn\n=M2\n1\n(n\u2212 1)!(\u2212Q\n2)n\n(\nd\ndQ2\n)n\nF(Q2) , (10)\n4\nwhere F is a generic function of Q2 = \u2212q2. The application of such a procedure to the\nsum-rules amounts to exploiting the following result:\nB\n[\n1\n(s+Q2)n\n]\n=\nexp(\u2212s\/M2)\n(M2)n (n\u2212 1)! , (11)\nwhere M2 is known as the Borel parameter. This operation improves the convergence of\nthe series in the OPE by factorials in n and, for suitably chosen values of M2, enhances\nthe contribution of low lying states. Moreover, since the Borel transform of a polynomial\nvanishes, it is correct to neglect subtraction terms in Eq. (6), which are polynomials in\nq2. The final sum-rule reads:\nm2f0 f\u02dc\n2 exp\n(\n\u2212 m\n2\nf0\nM2\n)\n=\n3\n8\u03c02\n\u222b s0\n4m2s\nds s\n(\n1\u2212 4m\n2\ns\ns\n)3\/2\nexp\n(\n\u2212 s\nM2\n)\n+ms exp\n(\n\u2212 m\n2\ns\nM2\n)[\n< ss >\n(\n3 +\nm2s\nM2\n+\nm4s\nM4\n)\n+ < sg\u03c3Gs >\n1\nM2\n(\n1\u2212 m\n2\ns\n2M2\n)]\n.(12)\nIn the numerical evaluation of Eq. (12) we use < ss >= 0.8 < qq >, < qq >= (\u22120.24)3\nGeV3, < sg\u03c3Gs >= 0.8 GeV2 < ss >, mf0 = 0.980 GeV. The strange quark mass\nis chosen in the range ms = 0.125 \u2212 0.160 GeV, obtained in the same QCD sum-rule\nframework [28]. The threshold is chosen below a possible f0(1370) pole and varied between\ns0 = 1.6 \u2212 1.7 GeV2. Since the Borel parameter has no physical meaning, we look for a\nrange of its values (\u201cstability window\u201d) where the sum-rule is almost independent on M2.\nSuch a window is usually sought in a restricted interval of values of the Borel parameter\nchosen by requiring that the perturbative contribution is at least 20% of the continuum\nand additionally requiring that the perturbative term is greater than the non-perturbative\ncontribution. The stability window for M2 is selected in [1.2, 2] GeV2, as seen in Fig. 1,\nwhere, taking into account the uncertainty on ms, we obtain the coupling:\nf\u02dc = (0.180\u00b1 0.015) GeV . (13)\nThis result will be used in the analysis of the decay \u03c6 \u2192 f0\u03b3 as we shall see in the\nfollowing.\nThe relevant matrix element describing the transition \u03c6 \u2192 f0 induced by a strange\nvector current J\u00b5 = s\u03b3\u00b5s, can be parameterized as follows:\n\u3008f0(q2)| J\u00b5 |\u03c6(q1, \u01eb1)\u3009 = F1(q2) (q1 \u00b7 q2) \u01eb1\u00b5 + F2(q2) (\u01eb1 \u00b7 q2) (q1 + q2)\u00b5\n+ F3(q\n2) (\u01eb1 \u00b7 q2) q\u00b5 (14)\n5\n~Figure 1: Coupling of the f0 to the scalar current as a function of the Borel parameter M ,\nfor ms = 0.140 GeV. The solid curve corresponds to the higher threshold s0 = 1.7 GeV\n2,\nthe dashed curve corresponds to s0 = 1.6 GeV\n2.\nwhere q = q1 \u2212 q2. In order to consider the radiative decay \u03c6 \u2192 f0\u03b3, one needs the\namplitude\nA(\u03c6(q1, \u01eb1)\u2192 f0(q2)\u03b3(q, \u01eb)) = \u22121\n3\ne \u01eb\u2217\u00b5 [F1(0) (q1 \u00b7q2) \u01eb1\u00b5+F2(0) (\u01eb1 \u00b7q2) (q1+q2)\u00b5] , (15)\nwhere the charge of the strange quark has been explicitly written. Eq. (15) shows that\nonly two of the three form factors appearing in Eq. (14) are actually needed. Furthermore,\ngauge invariance requires that q\u00b5 \u00b7 [F1(0) (q1 \u00b7 q2)\u01eb1\u00b5+F2(0) (\u01eb1 \u00b7 q2) (q1 + q2)\u00b5] = 0, which\nrelates the values of F1 and F2 at q\n2 = 0:\nF2(0) = F1(0)\nm2\u03c6 +m\n2\nf0\n2(m2\u03c6 \u2212m2f0)\n. (16)\nIn terms of F1(0), the rate for the process we consider becomes:\n\u0393(\u03c6\u2192 f0\u03b3) = \u03b1 [F1(0)]2\n(m2\u03c6 \u2212m2f0)(m2\u03c6 +m2f0)2\n216 m3\u03c6\n. (17)\nThree-point QCD sum-rules can be applied to evaluate the form factor F1(q\n2). We consider\nthe three-point function:\n\u03a0\u00b5\u03bd(q\n2\n1, q\n2\n2, q\n2) = i2\n\u222b\nd4x d4y e\u2212iq1\u00b7x eiq2\u00b7y \u30080|T [Js(y)J\u03bd(0)J\u00b5(x)] |0\u3009 (18)\n6\nwhere Js has been defined above and J\u03bd = s\u03b3\u03bds is the vector current. The correlator\nEq. (18) can be written in terms of invariant structures as follows:\n\u03a0\u00b5\u03bd(q\n2\n1, q\n2\n2, q\n2) = \u03a0(q21, q\n2\n2, q\n2) g\u00b5\u03bd +\u03a01(q\n2\n1 , q\n2\n2, q\n2) q1\u00b5q1\u03bd + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (19)\nand a QCD sum-rule can be built up for the structure \u03a0(q21, q\n2\n2, q\n2). The method closely\nfollows the one described for the two-point sum-rule. We assume \u03a0(q21, q\n2\n2, q\n2) obeys a\ndispersion relation in both the variables q21, q\n2\n2:\n\u03a0(q21, q\n2\n2, q\n2) =\n1\n\u03c02\n\u222b\nds1\n\u222b\nds2\n\u03c1(s1, s2, q\n2)\n(s1 \u2212 q21)(s2 \u2212 q22)\n, (20)\nwith possible subtractions. Such a representation is true at each order in perturbation\ntheory and, as is standard in QCD sum rule analyses, it is assumed to hold in general.\nIn this case the spectral function contains, for low values of s1, s2, a double \u03b4\u2212function\ncorresponding to the transition \u03c6\u2192 f0. Extracting this contribution, we can write:\n\u03a0(q21, q\n2\n2, q\n2) = \u2212mf0 f\u02dc m\u03c6 f\u03c6 F1(q\n2)(q1 \u00b7 q2)\n(m2\u03c6 \u2212 q21)(m2f0 \u2212 q22)\n+\n1\n\u03c02\n\u222b \u221e\ns\u2032\n0\nds1\n\u222b \u221e\ns0\nds2\n\u03c1had(s1, s2, q\n2)\n(s1 \u2212 q21)(s2 \u2212 q22)\n,\n(21)\nwhere subtractions are neglected as later they will vanish on taking a Borel transform.\nThe parameter f\u02dc appearing in the previous equation is just the coupling of the f0 to the\nscalar current, computed previously. Deriving an OPE-based QCD expansion for \u03a0 for\nlarge and negative q21 , q\n2\n2 and q\n2, one can write:\n\u03a0(q21, q\n2\n2, q\n2) =\n1\n\u03c02\n\u222b \u221e\n4m2s\nds1\n\u222b \u221e\n4m2s\nds2\n\u03c1pert(s1, s2, q\n2)\n(s1 \u2212 q21)(s2 \u2212 q22)\n+ c3 < ss > +c5 < sg\u03c3Gs > +... .\n(22)\nInvoking quark-hadron global duality as before, we arrive at the sum-rule:\nmf0 f\u02dc m\u03c6 f\u03c6 F1(q\n2) (q2 \u2212m2\u03c6 \u2212m2f0)\n2(m2\u03c6 \u2212 q21)(m2\u03b7 \u2212 q22)\n=\n1\n\u03c02\n\u222b\nD\nds1ds2\n\u03c1pert(s1, s2, q\n2)\n(s1 \u2212 q21)(s2 \u2212 q22)\n+ c3 < ss > +c5 < sg\u03c3Gs > +... , (23)\nwhere the domain D should now also satisfy the kinematical constraints specified below.\nAfter a double Borel transform in the variables \u2212q21 and \u2212q22 , we obtain:\n1\n2\nmf0 f\u02dcm\u03c6f\u03c6(q\n2 \u2212m2\u03c6 \u2212m2f0)F1(q2) exp\n(\n\u2212 m\n2\n\u03c6\nM21\n\u2212 m\n2\nf0\nM22\n)\n=\n1\n\u03c02\n\u222b\nD\nds1ds2 exp\n(\n\u2212 s1\nM21\n\u2212 s2\nM22\n)\n\u03c1pert(s1, s2) (24)\n7\n+ exp\n(\n\u2212 m\n2\ns\nM21\n\u2212 m\n2\ns\nM22\n) {\n< ss >\n[\nq2 + 2m2s \u2212\nm2sq\n2\nM21\n+\nm2sq\n2(2m2s \u2212 q2)\n2M21M\n2\n2\n+\nm4sq\n2\n2\n(\n1\nM41\n+\n1\nM42\n)]\n+ < sg\u03c3Gs >\n[\n\u2212 1\n3\n+\nq2 \u2212m2s\n3M21\n+\n2q2 +m2s\n3M22\n\u2212 q\n2(5m2s \u2212 2q2)\n6M21M\n2\n2\n\u2212 m\n2\nsq\n2\n4M42\n\u2212 m\n2\ns(3q\n2 +m2s)\n12M41\n]}\n,\nwhere:\n\u03c1pert(s1, s2) =\n3ms\n4\n{\n(4m2s + s1 \u2212 s2 + q2)\n[(\ns1 + s2 \u2212 q2\n)2 \u2212 4s1s2]+ 4q2s1s2}\/[\n(s1 + s2 \u2212 q2)2 \u2212 4s1s2\n]3\/2\n. (25)\nThe integration domainD over the variables s1, s2 depends on the value of q\n2. For (\u2212q2) >\ns0 \u2212 4m2s, D is specified by: (s2)\u2212 \u2264 s2 \u2264 s0 4m2s \u2264 s1 \u2264 s\u20320; while, for (\u2212q2) < s0 \u2212 4m2s\nD is bounded by: (s2)\u2212 \u2264 s2 \u2264 (s2)+ if 4m2s \u2264 s1 \u2264 (s1)\u2212 and (s2)\u2212 \u2264 s2 \u2264 s0 if (s1)\u2212 \u2264\ns1 \u2264 s\u20320, with: (s2)\u00b1 =\n[\n2m2sq\n2 + (2m2s \u2212 q2)s1 \u00b1\n\u221a\ns1q2(q2 \u2212 4m2s)(s1 \u2212 4m2s)\n]\n\/2m2s and\n(s1)\u00b1 =\n[\n2m2sq\n2 + (2m2s \u2212 q2)s0 \u00b1\n\u221a\ns0q2(q2 \u2212 4m2s)(s0 \u2212 4m2s)\n]\n\/2m2s.\nSince we consider the form-factor F1(q\n2) for arbitrary negative values of q2, we could\nperform a double Borel transform in the two variables Q21 = \u2212q21 and Q22 = \u2212q22 , which\nallows us to remove single poles in the s1 and s2 channels from the sum-rule. Our pro-\ncedure is therefore to compute the form-factor F1(q\n2) and then to extrapolate the result\nto q2 = 0. In the numerical analysis we use: m\u03c6 = 1.02 GeV, f\u03c6 = 0.234 GeV (obtained\nfrom the experimental datum on the decay to e+e\u2212 [15]). We compute the result for two\nvalues of the \u03c6 threshold: s\u20320 = 1.8, 1.9 GeV\n2. s0 coincides with the f0 threshold chosen\nas for the two point function. The extrapolation to q2 = 0 shown in Fig. 2 gives:\nF1(0) = 0.34\u00b1 0.07 , (26)\nwhich, using \u0393(\u03c6) = 4.458 MeV [15] and Eq. (17), gives:\nB(\u03c6\u2192 f0\u03b3) = (2.7\u00b1 1.1) 10\u22124 . (27)\nBoth the results Eq. (13) and Eq. (26) have been derived without the inclusion of radiative\n\u03b1s corrections, an approximation which is usually believed more accurate for the three\npoint sum rule, where the O(\u03b1s) corrections are expected to cancel in the ratio of a\nthree-point and a two-point function.\n8\nFigure 2: Form factor F1(q\n2). The dashed and dotted lines are the highest and the lowest\ncurves obtained varying the set of parameters entering in the sum rule (24). The isolated\npoint on the right is the result of an extrapolation. The result (26) corresponds to the\ncentral point on the right obtained by extrapolating the solid curve.\nOur result of Eq. (27) is in reasonable agreement with the outcome of refs. [29, 11],\nwhere the decay is supposed to proceed through the chain \u03c6 \u2192 KK\u03b3 \u2192 f0\u03b3, and so\ndepends on the coupling gf0KK\n3. Their results are: B(\u03c6 \u2192 f0\u03b3) = 1.9 \u00d7 10\u22124 [29] and\nB(\u03c6\u2192 f0\u03b3) = 1.35\u00d710\u22124 [11]. On the other hand, QCD spectral sum rules are exploited\nin ref. [31] to predict B(\u03c6\u2192 f0\u03b3) = 1.3\u00d7 10\u22124.\nA different strategy is proposed in [16], where the experimental datum is assumed\ntogether with the structure f0(980) = nn cos \u03b8 + ss sin \u03b8, where nn = (uu + dd)\/\n\u221a\n2 and\n\u03b8 is a mixing angle. A theoretical prediction is derived describing the particles (\u03c6, f0)\nthrough wave functions depending on the radii of the mesons. Such a prediction is then\ncompared to the experimental datum in order to constrain the mixing angle.\nAlthough our result of Eq. (27) is affected by a rather large uncertainty, it is in\nagreement with the available data [18, 19]. Since our sum rule analysis is based on the\nhypothesis that the f0(980) couples to the scalar ss current, this agreement leads to the\nconclusion that an ss component is present in such a state. However, our branching\nratio is an order of magnitude larger than the naive quark model gives for a pure ss\n3Such a coupling is taken from ref. [30].\n9\nstate. Our result is consequently consistent with the view that the f0(980) is a meson\nwith a basic qq composition, which spends a sizeable part of its lifetime in a two meson\nstate, such as KK. This is in keeping with the analyses of [6, 8, 17, 32] that attribute\nsuch multi-hadron components to dressing. While the effect of KK couplings have been\nstudied phenomenologically in Ref. [16] in a range of hadronic reactions, they have been\ndynamically calculated by Marco et al. [33] explicitly for the radiative decay we study\nhere and found to give B(\u03c6 \u2192 f0\u03b3) = 2.4 \u00d7 10\u22124, in reassuringly good agreement with\nour sum-rule result, Eq. (27).\nWe acknowledge the EU-TMR Programme, Contract No. CT98-0169, EuroDA\u03a6NE\nfor support.
