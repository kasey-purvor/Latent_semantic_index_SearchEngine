Ionosphere (Electric fields and currents) \u2013 Mag-\nnetosphere (Magnetosphere-ionosphere interactions; Plasma\nconvection)\n1 Introduction\nHigh-speed plasma flows in the near-Earth and mid-tail\nplasma sheet are considered to play a key role in the flux\nand energy transport in the magnetotail. Most likely, these\nfast flows are due to acceleration in the reconnection re-\ngion. The flows near the boundary of the plasma sheet con-\nsist of field-aligned beams, whereas the flows in the cen-\ntral plasma sheet tend to have a large bulk flow component.\nThe latter flows organize themselves in 10-min time scale\nflow enhancements, which are called bursty bulk flow (BBF)\nevents, embedding velocity peaks of 1-min duration, which\nare called flow bursts, and have characteristics distinctly dif-\nferent from plasma sheet boundary layer flows (Baumjohann\net al., 1990; Angelopoulos et al., 1992).\nTo understand the magnetic flux transport process or to\ndiscuss the energy budget problems in the magnetosphere, it\nis crucial to quantify the bursty bulk flow signatures. Many\nstudies using quite different methods with single spacecraft\nhave come to the conclusion that a BBF is expected to be\nlimited in dawn-dusk extent with a spatial scale of 3\u20135RE\n(Angelopoulos et al., 1997; Kauristie et al., 2000; Nakamura\net al., 2001). These results were obtained by comparison be-\ntween satellite and ground-based data, and low-altitude ob-\nservations of convection, equivalent current, and auroral pat-\ntern. In-situ multi-point observations by ISEE and Cluster\nprovided more direct evidence on the spatial scale, which in-\nferred a scale size of 1\u20133RE (Sergeev et al., 1996; Nakamura\net al., 2004).\n554 R. Nakamura et al.: Fast flow in plasma sheet and ionosphere\nClose relationships between the bursty bulk flow and the\nauroral signatures were reported by a number of studies\n(Fairfield et al., 1999; Sergeev et al., 1999; Zesta et al., 2000;\nNakamura et al., 2001; Grocott et al., 2004). The relationship\nbetween the ionosphere and magnetosphere during fast flows\nis also essential to understand the role of these fast flows in\nlarger-scale processes such as substorms. A review of the\ncurrent understanding of the various ionospheric phenomena\nrelated to fast flows is given by Amm and Kauristie (2002).\nOne major question they pose concerns the difference be-\ntween substorm and non-substorm events. They also point\nout, however, that many of the observed ionospheric effects\ncan be shielded or greatly obscured during substorm expan-\nsions, by the inherent large-scale electrodynamics. In fact,\nGrocott et al. (2004) obtained for the first time an iono-\nspheric flow pattern consistent with the BBF observed by\nCluster during a small pseudobreakup. These observations\nsuggest that during quiet conditions, in the course of a sub-\nstorm growth phase, some 10 min after a southward turning\nof the IMF, the BBF associated convection pattern could be\nobserved as a mapped pattern in the ionosphere. Therefore,\nlocalized precipitation and associated field-aligned currents\ninferred from the IMAGE auroral data and electric potentials\nwere not significant to affect the mapping of the electric field.\nSeveral mechanisms have been proposed to account for the\nauroral precipitation or field-aligned current directly associ-\nated with the fast flows. The bursty bulk flows, which are\nusually limited in cross-tail scale and are often underpopu-\nlated flux tubes, called \u201cbubbles\u201d, are considered to become\nelectrically polarized and thereby launching Alfve\u00b4n waves in\na sense where the upward field-aligned current is created at\nthe duskward edge, similar to the substorm current wedge\n(e.g. Chen and Wolf, 1993, 1999). Birn and Hesse (1996)\nand Birn et al. (1999) showed that the earthward reconnec-\ntion flows are diverted dawnward and duskward in associ-\nation with the dipolarization of the magnetic field. Conse-\nquently, flow shear is created well inside the closed field\nline region and generates magnetic shear corresponding to\nthe field-aligned currents of the current wedge in a bubble\n(Birn et al., 2004). The observed equivalent current pattern\nduring flow bursts also supports the direct connection of the\ntransient plasma sheet flows to the ionospheric current via a\nsmall field-aligned current wedge (Kauristie et al., 2000).\nCluster multi-point observations of BBFs combined with\nconjugate observations on the ground allow us to discuss the\nspatial structure of the disturbances simultaneously in the\nionosphere and the magnetosphere to further compare with\nthe theories. In this paper an isolated flow burst at 22:02 UT,\n1 September 2002, is studied when the Cluster footpoint was\nlocated within the MIRACLE area. With a tetrahedron scale\nof 4000 km during summer 2002, Cluster is in an ideal con-\nfiguration to study the spatial structure of the flow. We exam-\nine the spatial and\/or temporal scale of the flow burst and its\nrelevant counterparts in the ionosphere and discuss the elec-\ntrodynamics of the flow-associated disturbance in the iono-\nsphere and the magnetosphere.\n2 Overview of the event\nFigure 1 shows the location of the Cluster spacecraft in (a)\nthe X\u2212Y plane, (b) the X\u2212Z, and (c) the Y\u2212Z plane in the\ntop three panels. Unless noted, the geomagnetic solar mag-\nnetospheric coordinate (GSM) system is used throughout this\npaper. Cluster was located near midnight atX=\u221218RE . The\nrelative location of the four Cluster spacecraft to the refer-\nence spacecraft (SC3) in (d) the X\u2212Y plane, (e) the X\u2212Z\nplane, and (f) the Y\u2212Z are shown in the next three panels\nin Fig. 1 for 22:00 UT, 1 September 2002. SC 2 was the\nmost western satellite, SC 3 the most southward, SC 4 the\nmost tailward and SC1 the most earthward. Figure 1g shows\nthe geographic location of the MIRACLE magnetometer sta-\ntions between latitude 64\u25e6 and 71\u25e6. Also shown are the foot-\npoints of the four Cluster spacecraft calculated using the Tsy-\nganenko (1989) model (T89). For this event, the footpoints\nwere calculated also using the Hybrid Input Algorithm (HIA)\nmodel (Kubyshkina et al., 1999), which uses input from sev-\neral spacecraft measurements to modify the tail and ring cur-\nrents of the T89 model, in order to obtain a best fit to the\nsatellite observations. For this particular event data from the\nCluster, POLAR and LANL satellites were used to modify\nthe model. Yet the mapped location for this event did not\ndiffer significantly from the T89, Kp=4 mapping. The ex-\npected errors are <0.1\u25e6 in latitude and <0.5\u25e6 in longitude.\nKIL was the station closest to the Cluster footpoints.\nMagnetotail data from Cluster, solar wind data from Geo-\ntail and ground magnetograms from selected MIRACLE sta-\ntions ordered with increasing latitude are shown in Fig. 2.\nCluster observations from the fluxgate magnetometer (FGM)\nexperiment (Balogh et al., 2001) obtained by the four space-\ncraft, and proton data from the Composition and Distribution\nFunction Analyser (CODIF) of the Cluster ion spectrometry\n(CIS) experiment (Re`me et al., 2001) from Cluster 4 are also\nshown in Fig. 2. For the ion data we use proton data from the\nCODIF instrument for Cluster 1 and 4, while ion data from\nthe Hot Ion Analyser (HIA) instrument are used for Cluster 3.\nGeotail was located at X=18, Y=23, and Z=0.4RE in the\nsolar wind. Data from the Geotail magnetic field measure-\nment (Kokubun et al., 1994) showed quite stable southward\nIMF after 21:00 UT. It can be seen that the total pressure in\nthe magnetotail observed by Cluster, gradually increased un-\ntil around 23:00 UT, suggesting that a pileup of the magnetic\nflux took place. The pressure dropped significantly, associ-\nated with the enhancement of the westward electrojet in the\nMIRACLE stations, which is a typical signature of the ex-\npansion phase of a major substorm. Cluster stayed mainly in\nthe plasma sheet until 23:05 UT when the spacecraft went out\ninto the lobe associated with the major substorm expansion\nphase onset. The details of the substorm expansion phase\nonset at 23:05 UT were studied in Draper et al. (2004). The\nbursty bulk flow event which will be studied in detail in this\npaper occurred at around 22:00 UT, as shown as a grey bar\nin Fig. 2. The event took place about 1 h before the major\nonset during a prolonged interval of southward IMF with a\nvery weak signature in the auroral electrojet in the midnight\nR.

This rather steady magnetospheric\/ionospheric con-\ndition allows us to investigate the BBF related disturbance\nwithout any significant contamination from other activities.\nIn the following sections, we will first investigate the tem-\nporal and spatial characteristics of the bursty bulk flows and\nthen examine the associated ionospheric signatures.\n3 BBF signatures in the magnetosphere\nFigure 3 shows the Cluster magnetic field and ion obser-\nvations during the flow interval. Earthward flow with a\nspeed exceeding 700 km\/s was observed for the three space-\ncraft between 22:00 and 22:04 UT associated with a sharp\nenhancement in Bz, indicating dipolarization, which is vis-\nible also on SC2; but since CIS is not operational on SC2,\nwe discuss on plasma flows on SC2, later using other ob-\nservations. The flow burst was accompanied by a decrease\nin density and an increase in magnetic field pressure, which\nis a typical signature for a plasma bubble (Sergeev et al.,\n1996). Compared to the high-speed flow features, mag-\nnetic field fluctuation lasted somewhat longer. The fluctu-\nations in all three components were visible already starting\nbefore 21:58 UT. All spacecraft entered the neutral sheet re-\ngion by the end of the flows and the fluctuations ceased after\n22:08 UT. The enhanced difference among the traces of the\nfour spacecraft suggests that the local current density con-\ntained small-scale structures.\n556 R.

The grey vertical line indicates the bursty bulk flow event around 22:00 UT.\nThe bottom three panels of energy flux spectra and angular\ndistribution data from SC 1 show that the distribution at\nthe maximum flow interval (22:01\u201322:02 UT) has a signifi-\ncant perpendicular component (close to 90\u25e6) to the magnetic\nfield. Before this flow, some enhancement in the tailward\n(180\u25e6) component can be seen in the low-energy part be-\ntween 21:58\u201321:59 UT. Between 21:59 and 22:00 UT, the\nenergetic component (>10 keV) consists of a tailward field-\naligned beam and a perpendicular component, whereas for\nthe lower energies, the perpendicular component is domi-\nnant. The energy of the field-aligned component is therefore\nincreased. The ion velocity distribution significantly changes\nbetween 22:00 UT and 22:01 UT, which will be discussed\nlater. There is also a signature of a beam (180\u25e6) after the bulk\nflows. The field-aligned beam weakens between 22:04 and\n22:05 UT. Taking into account all of these features, we can\nsay that the time period of the ion flow and beam disturbance\nat Cluster was between about 21:58 and 22:05 UT, which has\nR.

Cluster 3 was about 3000 km south of\nthe other spacecraft but still over the Northern Hemisphere,\nwhich is consistent with the small values in Bx before and\nafter the event. But during the flow burst interval, the traces\nare more complicated. It can be seen that Cluster 2 stayed\nin a large Bx region longer than the other three spacecraft.\nNote that Cluster 2 was located most duskward and therefore\nthe difference implies a dawn-dusk localized structure of the\nflow. Since there is no ion data from Cluster 2, we use the\nelectric field data from the Electric Field and Wave (EFW)\ninstrument (Gustafsson et al., 2001) to further investigate the\nspacecraft difference. A detailed in-flight calibration of the\nelectric field measurements was done by comparing with the\nquiet time CIS moments for Clusters 1, 3, and 4 before and\nafter the BBF event. On Cluster 2, the calibration was based\non a typical default value, and so one needs to remember\nthat the electric field in the Sun direction on this spacecraft\nmay still contain a small error. The three components of the\nelectric field are obtained by assuming E\u00b7B=0.\nFigure 4 shows the flow perpendicular to the magnetic\nfield and the electric field and density profile between 21:55\nand 22:10 UT using measurements from CIS and EFW.

The electric field data are plotted using the EFW measurement and the assumption of E\u00b7B=0.\nThe bottom two panels show the proton density from Clusters 1 and 4 and the negative value of the spacecraft potential from Clusters 1 and\n2.\ndiscrepancies in the magnitude, the general trend between\nCIS and EFW coincides during the flow event, suggesting\nthat the perpendicular flow moment from CIS is mainly due\nto the E\u00d7B velocity. It can also be seen that it is Ez that\ndeflects the BBF toward the azimuthal direction rather than\nEx for this event. The bottom two panels show the density\nprofile from Clusters 1 and 4 and the negative value of the\nspacecraft potential, \u2212Vsc, from Clusters 1 and 2. The latter\nis a good indicator of the density, which can be seen in the\nsimilar temporal profile between the Cluster 1 traces in the\ntwo bottom panels. The profile shows that Cluster 2 also en-\ncountered the plasma bubble. Yet the electric field plot from\nEFW, as well as the flow plots, show that Cluster 2 observed\nsignificantly smaller velocities and electric fields compared\nto the other spacecraft during the BBF event.\nOne can see that the Vy and Ez values on Cluster 2 be-\nfore the BBF event also differ a little from the values on the\nother spacecraft. As given above, Ex calibration cannot be\nquite accurately performed for Cluster 2, which may explain\nthese negative Vy and Ez offsets. The differences could be,\nhowever, also real and due to spatial changes. Nevertheless,\nthese differences at non-BBF times are small enough so that\none can conclude that both the Ey and Ez, or Vx and Vy , are\nsignificantly smaller for Cluster 2 during the BBF.\nThere is also a clear spacecraft difference in the timing\nof the dipolarization in Fig. 3. The dipolarization started at\nCluster 4, followed by Clusters 1 and 2, and then Cluster 3.\nNote that Cluster 4 was located most tailward, as shown in\nFig. 1.

Such\nmotion of the dipolarization front was also obtained by Clus-\nter during a dawnside flow burst (Nakamura et al., 2002).\nThe structure of the fast flows can be determined by ex-\namining the orientation of the dipolarization front by per-\nforming the minimum variance analysis of the magnetic field\n(Sergeev et al., 1996; Nakamura et al., 2002). We used the\n1-s averaged FGM data to determine the orientation of the\nboundary. We performed also the maximum variance anal-\nysis of the electric field (Sonnerup and Scheible, 1998, and\nreferences therein), using 1-s averaged EFW data for Clus-\nters 2 and 4 from which high resolution data were avail-\nable. The resulting normal vectors to the dipolarization front\nare shown in Table 1. As a quality check of the minimum\n(maximum) variance analysis, the ratio between intermedi-\nate (maximum) and minimum (intermediate) eigenvalues is\nalso given in the table. In spite of the fact that the quality of\nthe analysis is rather poor for the electric field data, agree-\nment between the two methods of boundary determination\nfor Cluster 2 and 4 is quite good. The projection of the dipo-\nlarization front in (a) the X\u2212Y plane, in (b) the X\u2212Z plane\nand in (c) the Y\u2212Z plane are shown in Fig. 5 as dotted lines\nfor the orientation obtained from minimum variance analysis\nof the magnetic field data and as dashed lines for the orienta-\ntion obtained from maximum variance analysis of the electric\nfield data. The normal direction is presented with a thin line\ncrossing the dotted or dashed lines. The orientation of the\ndipolarization front of the three northern spacecraft, Clus-\nters 1, 2, and 4, shows a clear dependence in the Y direction,\nthat is, the dipolarization front of Cluster 2, which is located\nmost duskward, is more tilted toward the X direction com-\npared to Clusters 1 and 4, which have a dipolarization front\nmore aligned in the Y direction. The difference suggests that\nCluster 2 sees the edge effect of a localized flow channel.\nThe difference in orientation can also be seen in the X\u2212Z\nplane, which comes from the fact that the field configuration\nof Cluster 2 is more tail-like (large Bx). There is no ion data\nfor Cluster 2. But this edge effect was also obtained in the\n560 R.

Clusters 1, 3, and 4 observations of the ion flow speed and direction of the flow relative to the normal direction of the dipolarization\nfront in the X\u2212Y plane and in the X\u2212Z plane. Here the relative azimuth angle corresponds to the angle between the flow and the normal\ndirection in the X\u2212Y plane, whereas the relative latitude angle corresponds in the X\u2212Z plane. The left panels are for the total ion flow,\nwhereas the right panels for the perpendicular component of the flows. The vertical dashed lines show the period of the dipolarization for\neach spacecraft presented with the same color (Clusters 1, 3 and 4 data are indicated with black, green, and blue) as the velocity profile.\nelectric field measurement (Fig. 4) in which the E\u00d7B drift\nfor Cluster 2 was significantly smaller compared to the other\nspacecraft.\nSince the shear of the flow could be directly related to the\nfield-aligned current, it is of interest to examine how the flow\ndirection is oriented relative to the dipolarization front. Fig-\nure 6 shows the ion flow direction change relative to the nor-\nmal direction in the X\u2212Y plane and in the X\u2212Z plane for\ntotal flow (left panel) and flow perpendicular to the magnetic\nfield (right panel). Here the azimuth angle corresponds to the\nangle between the flow and the normal direction to the dipo-\nlarization front in the X\u2212Y plane, whereas the latitude angle\ncorresponds to the relative angle in the X\u2212Z plane. The\nvertical dashed lines show the period of the dipolarization\n(rapid change in Bz) for each spacecraft presented with the\nsame color as the velocity profile. It can be seen that domi-\nnant changes in the direction around the boundary took place\nin the azimuthal angle. It became positive before and dur-\ning the dipolarization, but changed rapidly to negative just\nafter the dipolarization and then changed to a positive di-\nrection for the perpendicular component of the flow. The\nfast flow direction then became more aligned with the nor-\nmal direction to the dipolarization front. These three steps of\nchanges in the direction are presented in Fig. 5 with the ar-\nrows for the total flow marked with 1\u20133. For each spacecraft,\nthe longest arrow corresponds to the maximum flow during\nthe BBF event and is marked with 3. The thin arrow, which\nis marked with 2 and drawn from a point locating earthward\nalong the normal direction, corresponds to the flow vector\nat the time of the minimum azimuth angle after the dipo-\nlarization front. The short thick arrow drawn from a point\nfurther earthward along the normal direction, corresponds to\nthe flow vector at the time of the first maximum azimuthal\ndeflection before the dipolarization front and is marked with\n1. It can be seen from Figs. 5 and 6 that the BBF is preceded\nby deflections near the dipolarization front, which is first to-\nward dusk before the front (arrow 1) and then toward dawn\n(arrow 2), or toward the radial direction to the Earth, after\nthe passage of the front. As shown in Fig. 5, the flow deflec-\ntion produced by the arrows 1 and 2 around the dipolarization\nfront is then anticlockwise looking into the X\u2212Y plane from\nnorth (Fig. 5a), or clockwise looking from the tail into the\nY\u2212Z plane (Fig. 5c). This is consistent with the flow shear\nassociated with the magnetic shear producing field-aligned\ncurrent out from the ionosphere (Birn et al., 1999; Birn et al.,\n2004). An opposite sense of the shear near a dipolarization\nfront dawnside of a flow burst was reported by Nakamura et\nal. (2002), which suggests that a current wedge like a field-\naligned current may be created and associated with the flow\nburst if we take into account both observations.\n4 Ionospheric features\nAs shown in Fig. 1, the Cluster footpoint was located at the\nmiddle of the MIRACLE observation area. We examine the\ntemporal and spatial change in the equivalent current pat-\ntern around the time interval of the bursty bulk flows. In\nR. Nakamura et al.: Fast flow in plasma sheet and ionosphere 561\norder to examine the latitudinal variation of the currents, we\nuse a technique described by Vanhama\u00a8ki et al. (2003) that\nperforms the upward field continuation for a 1-D meridional\nchain of magnetometers using spherical coordinates. In this\ntechnique the magnetic field immediately below the iono-\nsphere is derived from the magnetic field measured on the\nground, assuming that the atmosphere in between is current-\nfree. Figure 7 shows the 1-D-upward field continuation of\nthe X component of the magnetic field, corresponding to\nthe east-west equivalent current, to the ionosphere performed\nfor the north-south IMAGE magnetometer chain. The black\nrectangle shows the time of the disturbance and footpoint\narea of the Cluster. The solid rectangle shows the inter-\nval of the flow disturbance at Cluster, whereas the dashed\none presents the interval of the entire current sheet distur-\nbance at Cluster which was discussed in the previous section.\nIt can be seen that a westward equivalent current centered\naround 70.5\u25e6 latitude suddenly jumps to 68.5\u25e6 starting at\n21:59:50 UT with the most equatorward maximum between\n22:03 and 22:04 UT, after which the maximum jumps back\npolewards. It is interesting to note that the Cluster BBF activ-\nity coincides temporally as well as spatially with this sudden\nequatorward movement of the westward electrojet. The west-\nward electrojet center located poleward of the spacecraft took\nplace earlier than the Cluster BBF observations, whereas the\nequatorward one took place later, suggesting that there is an\nequatorward propagating disturbance observed both at Clus-\nter and on the ground.\nFigure 8 shows the equivalent current pattern using the full\n2-D set of IMAGE magnetometer measurements based on\nthe 2-D magnetic field continuation technique to the iono-\nsphere (Amm, 1997; Amm and Viljanen, 1999) for every\n2 min between 21:56 and 22:10 UT. Although the amplitude\nof the disturbance in the equivalent current associated with\nthe flow is not exceeding several tens nT, a clear localized\npattern can be seen: development of a south-westward di-\nrected current at the Cluster footpoints region and south-west\nside of it, and a north-westward directed current at the north-\neastside of the former, starting around 22:00 UT and last-\ning until 22:08\u201322:09. A similar equivalent current pattern\nwas also obtained for an N-S aurora during a major substorm\ntime (see Fig. 7a, Amm et al., 1999), except for the much\nlarger amplitude of the current and wider extent of the pat-\ntern. Based on Amm et al. (1999), the south-westward equiv-\nalent current region that was located at the south-west side\nof the north-westward directed equivalent current region cor-\nresponded to the upward field-aligned current region. This\nwas aligned with the edge of the N-S auroral structures cor-\nresponding to the location where the south-westward equiva-\nlent current changed to a north-westward equivalent current.\nAt the eastern side of it where the equivalent current was\nnorth-westward, a downward current was widely distributed.\nAlthough the conductivity as well as the electric field pattern\nmay differ between these active and quiet times, development\nof the region of the south-westward equivalent current and\nnorth-westward equivalent current can also be clearly iden-\ntified in Fig. 8 (in 22:02\u201322:06 UT plots).

(1999) to the 1 September event,\nthe Cluster footpoint, which was located in a region mainly\nsouth-westward equivalent current near the changing loca-\ntion to the north-westward equivalent current, corresponds to\nthe upward field-aligned current at the auroral region. The\nupward field-aligned current in the ionosphere is consistent\nwith the field-aligned current out from the ionosphere, in-\nferred from the Cluster observation discussed in the previous\nsection.\nThe height-integrated conductances obtained from the Eu-\nropean Incoherent SCATter (EISCAT) facility for two VHF\nbeams from the Tromso radar are shown in Fig. 9: Beam 1\nlooks (almost) to the geographic north, beam 2 (almost) to\ngeomagnetic north. Black points are 6H , blue quadrants 6P\n(scale to the left), and red circles \u03b1=6H \/6P (scale to the\nright). Both beams see a clear conductance maximum around\n22:03 UT, in good agreement with the expected occurrence\nof the streamer current system. (The sudden drop at around\n22:04 UT for the beam 2 plot is an artifact because the con-\n562 R. Nakamura et al.: Fast flow in plasma sheet and ionosphere\nbeam 2 beam 1\nFig. 8.

Cluster footpoint is also shown in each plot.\nductance fitting has failed at several altitudes.) Beam 2 sees\nlarger conductances than beam 1. This is obvious from the\nplots of equivalent currents between 22:00 and 22:07 UT in\nwhich the location of the two beams is superposed to the\nequivalent current vectors in 22:04 UT plot in Fig. 8. Beam 2\nis closer to the westward flank of the streamer where we ex-\npect an upward field-aligned current and the largest conduc-\ntances. The absolute maximum values of \u223c90 S and \u223c140 S\nare rather high. Note, however, that the previous result by\nAmm et al. (1999) indicated that most of the current system\nrelated to a streamer is magnetically invisible, that is, for this\nevent EISCAT measures conductances with a smaller spatial\nscale than the detectable scale by the method of characteris-\ntics determined from the magnetic field measurements.\nFigure 10 shows two-dimensional maps of the Co-\noperative UK Twin Auroral Sounding System (CUTLASS)\nFinland flow data over the interval 21 : 56\u2212 22 : 10 UT. The\nCluster footpoint location is indicated in the 22:04 UT plot.\nSince there was no area where both of the two radars were\nobserving scatter, we cannot deduce the 2-D ionospheric\nflow vectors for this event. Yet we can deduce the possible\nchange in the convection pattern from the line-of-sight ve-\nlocity shown in the figure. Here positive (for example, blue)\nvelocity is towards the radar, whereas negative (for example,\nred) is flow away from the radar. The 21:56 UT plot with\nchange of color from blue to yellow shows the feature of the\ndawn-side cell, most likely related to a south-eastward drift.\nThis pattern is modified due to a retreat of the blue area at\nthe western side and an appearance of a blue area at the cen-\nter north-eastward of the Cluster meridian region, which is\nclearest at 22:04 UT plot. This pattern suggests that strong\nequatorward convection is developed, taking over the previ-\nous dawnward drift. Afterwards, the central blue area retreats\nand the western blue area appears to reform the initial pattern\nbetween 22:08 and 22:10 UT. These plots suggest, therefore,\nthat a localized strong equatorward convection pattern ap-\npeared, around the Cluster meridian, centered north-east of\nthe Cluster region, during the similar time interval as the\nequivalent current and conductivity enhancement showed.\nGrocott et al. (2004) observed a similar localized equator-\nward ionospheric flow enhancement but in the dusk cell of\nthe global convection region obtained by SuperDARN, asso-\nciated with a bursty bulk flow and pseudobreakup.\n5 Discussion\nThe Cluster spacecraft observations of an isolated flow burst\nwith the spacecraft tetrahedron scale of 4000 km showed a\nclear difference among the spacecraft, indicating the flow\nchannel to be spatially localized. As shown in Fig. 5a, the\ndipolarization front of Clusters 1, 2, and 4, that were lo-\ncated almost in a plane parallel to the X\u2212Y plane, showed\nhardly any difference along the X direction, but a clear edge\neffect along the Y direction. There were also some differ-\nences in the dipolarization front along the Z direction, as\nR. Nakamura et al.: Fast flow in plasma sheet and ionosphere 563\ncan be seen in Fig. 5b., that is, the dipolarization front is\nmore tilted against the X\u2212Y plane at Cluster 3 near the neu-\ntral sheet, compared to the other three spacecraft. Further-\nmore, the dipolarization front in the Cluster 3 direction sug-\ngests that the Y dimension of the flow channel could have a\nsomewhat different shape close to the equatorial plane. Since\nClusters 1 and 2 observed the dipolarization front within 1 s\nin nearly the same Z, we can assume that the difference is\nmainly spatial, and the front structure is observed by these\ntwo spacecraft, as illustrated in Fig. 11a, and we can deduce\nthe spatial scale of the flow. If we simply assume a circular\nsurface, for simplicity, then the radius corresponds to the half\nsize of the flow. From the Cluster 1 and Cluster 2 difference\nin the Y component of the normal direction and spacecraft lo-\ncation, we can deduce a radius of 1.1RE , whereas from the\nX component of the normal direction and spacecraft location\nthe radius was 0.75RE . Although the actual front cannot be\na circular surface, and the fronts were observed not exactly\nsimultaneously, this simple estimation provides a typical di-\nmension of the fast flow, 1.5\u20132.2RE . This is comparable\nto the statistical studies of the flow burst (Nakamura et al.,\n2004) which showed that on average its spatial scale is 2\u2013\n3RE in the dawn-dusk direction and 1.5\u20132RE in the north-\nsouth direction.\nAll three Cluster spacecraft with plasma measurements,\nClusters 1, 3, and 4, showed a systematic change of the flow\ndirection relative to the dipolarization front, as illustrated in\nFig. 11a. There is a strong flow shear at the front: at the\nearthward part flows direct more toward dusk, whereas the\nflow right behind the front was directed rather toward mid-\nnight (or more radial direction). The flow shear at the dipo-\nlarization front is expected to cause a field-aligned current\nout from the ionosphere, consistent with the simulation of\nthe bubble (Birn et al., 1999; Birn et al., 2004). It is interest-\ning to note that this strong shear at the dipolarization front is\ndue to the deflection of the flow toward radial direction (or\nconversion of the flow direction) but not due to the diversion\nof the fast flow as was predicted in the simulation. An op-\nposite sense of the rotation is created between this radially\ndeflected flow and the major flow behind, although this ro-\ntation involves much larger spatial scale and therefore may\ncontribute to weaker and broader field-aligned current flow-\ning into the ionosphere.\nThe current sheet disturbance associated with the flow\nburst in the magnetosphere coincides with a sudden jump in\nthe westward ionospheric equivalent current and the develop-\nment of a localized ionospheric equivalent current (obtained\nfrom the MIRACLE magnetometers) and electric field pat-\ntern (inferred from the line-of-sight velocity of SuperDARN)\nand their recovery within 1\u20132 min. The onset of the bursty\nbulk flow, on the other hand, was observed after the cur-\nrent sheet and ground magnetic field disturbances broke out,\nbut still before the maximum of the ionospheric disturbance.\nThis could be related to the fact that initially the center of the\nwestward electrojet was located at a higher latitude than the\nCluster footpoint but then it moved equatorward of the foot-\npoint, possibly indicating that the magnetospheric source re-\n21:48                        21:54                       22:00                        22:06                       22:12       \n21:48                        21:54                       22:00                        22:06                       22:12       \n21:48                        21:54                       22:00                        22:06                       22:12       \n21:48                        21:54                       22:00                        22:06                       22:12       \nFig. 9. The height-integrated conductances with time obtained from\nEISCAT radar for two VHF beams from the Tromso radar: Beam 1\nlooks (almost) to the geographic north, beam 2 (almost) to geomag-\nnetic north. Black points are 6H , blue quadrants 6P (scale to the\nleft), and red circles \u03b1=6H \/6P (scale to the right).\ngion was moving equatorward. The current sheet disturbance\nseems to be therefore directly coupled with the ionospheric\nactivity, whereas the flow itself could cause the equatorward\njump of the electrojet reaching the maximum of the iono-\nspheric activity.\nFigure 11b shows the curl of the equivalent current at\n22:02 UT. This quantity would be proportional to the field-\naligned currents if there were uniform conductances. This is\nnot exactly the case since EISCAT observed some local con-\nductance enhancement. Yet the observations indicated a very\nlocalized enhancement, and it is therefore expected that such\na localized conductivity feature would not affect the overall\nstructure of the equivalent current pattern. The Cluster foot-\npoint location is at the south-western edge of this negative\ncurl, corresponding to the region of an upward field-aligned\ncurrent, as also expected in the magnetosphere. A devel-\noped positive curl region can be seen at the further north-\neast side, forming a possible downward current region. Yet\nit should be noted that this structure starts to build up al-\nready at 21:56:40 UT, with a detached patch of negative curl\nequatorward of the background system. These observations\nin the magnetosphere and ionosphere suggest that the 2-min\nlong observation of bursty bulk flow at Cluster could be due\n564 R.

Nakamura et al.: Fast flow in plasma sheet and ionosphere 565\nto the spacecraft passing the flow channel, while a current\nsystem and electric field pattern were activated, expanding\nthe area and recovering again in about 10 min. Cluster also\nobserved tailward field-aligned beams before and after the\nflow burst. Tailward flows have been predicted in the flux\ntube behind the earthward moving bubble (Birn et al., 2004).\nThe field-aligned tailward flows behind the flow burst could\nbe explained by such a mechanism. Since the energy spec-\ntra in Fig. 3 suggests that spacecraft moved from the outer\nplasma sheet to the inner plasma sheet, the preceding beam\nmay also be interpreted due to the same mechanism.\nThe BBF event in this study, with an enhanced equa-\ntorward flow in the ionosphere, suggests that the magneto-\nspheric electric field pattern directly mapped into the iono-\nsphere could possibly be observed. Due to the low (or\nvery localized) conductance enhancement, as can be seen\nfrom the small, overall magnetic disturbance, the resultant\nHall-current pattern was reproduced in the equivalent cur-\nrent pattern. Grocott et al. (2004) determined the curl of the\nionospheric convection, which could correspond to the field-\naligned current region in a uniform conductivity. A similar\npair of curls is seen in the equivalent current, suggesting that\nthe current wedgelet was also observed in this study. Based\non a model of a bubble-associated electric field in the mag-\nnetosphere mapped to the ionosphere and uniform Hall con-\nductivity, Chen et al. (2004) predicted a similar south-west\nequivalent current pattern at the south-west of the bubble, as\nwas observed in this study. Figure 11c illustrates the pos-\nsible spatial relationships between the flow channel in the\nmagnetosphere and conjugate ionospheric disturbance. Tak-\ning into account the equivalent current pattern from magne-\ntospheric and ionospheric observations, the area surrounded\nby the pink curve shows the expected area conjugate to the\nflow channel. It is interesting to note that the alignment of the\npossible region of the auroral streamer is directed northwest-\nsoutheast, whereas the main fast flow direction is mapped\nto a more northeast-southwest direction, meaning that it is\nthe dipolarization front that creates the magnetic shear and\ncauses the possible precipitation and field-aligned current\nand, therefore, aligned to the auroral streamer direction.\n6 Conclusion\nThe ionospheric and magnetospheric signatures of a plasma\nsheet fast flow have been determined using simultaneous\nCluster and ground-based observations during a steady IMF\nperiod with small background ground magnetic activity in\nthe midnight sector. From the orientation of the dipolariza-\ntion front, it was inferred that Cluster was located at the dusk-\nside part of a localized plasma sheet flow channel of scalesize\n1.5\u20132RE , with a shear in the flow, suggesting a field-aligned\ncurrent out from the ionosphere at the front. This struc-\nture was consistent with the ground-based equivalent current\npattern and possible field-aligned current location. These ob-\nservations confirm that the localized enhanced convection in\nthe magnetosphere and the associated changes in the cur-\nrent sheet structure produce consistent ionospheric signa-\ntures with the similar temporal and spatial scale size at the\nconjugate region. This example also shows the strength and\nimportance of the inversion technique to identify the iono-\nspheric 3-D currents related to the localized signatures in the\ntail, because otherwise, one would have missed the signa-\ntures in the ionosphere for this very localized and weak event.\nAcknowledgements.
