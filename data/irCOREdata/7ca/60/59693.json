At Whitburn Bay, the lower Blackhall Till is a hybrid subglacial till with a high \npercentage of locally derived erratics.  A boulder pavement at the top of the lower till, \npoints to a switch in ice bed conditions and the production of a meltout lag prior to the \ndeposition of the upper, Horden Till.  This is a deformation till, and contains erratics and \nheavy minerals derived from crystalline bedrock sources in the Cheviot Hills and in the \nSouthern Uplands, including tremolite, andalusite, kyanite, clinopyroxenes and rutile.  \nWithin the Horden Till are numerous sand, clay and gravel-filled canals incised \ndownwards into the diamicton, which are attributed to a low energy, subglacially \ndistributed, braided canal drainage system.  This evidence, coupled with hydrofractures \nand the boulder pavement, suggests that the Horden Till was deposited by a surging, \nfast-flowing ice stream which was decoupled from its bed.  The upward, on-land direction \nof ice movement indicates that the ice stream was confined in the North Sea Basin, \npossibly by the presence of Scandinavian Ice.   \n \n \n1. Introduction \n1.1  Rationale and aims \nThe behaviour of the British and Irish Ice Sheet (BIIS) along the eastern coast of \nduring the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) is poorly understood (Carr et al. 2006).  \nlobes from both northwest Britain and Scotland overran the area, but the flow \nlobes, and their dynamic interaction, have only been partially reconstructed.  It \nsuggested that ice from the northwest crossed the coast first before ice sourced \nCheviot\/Tweed area flowed north to south down the coast (Teasdale & Hughes \nsediments and landforms related to the latter phase of ice flow suggest a surge \noperated along this coast (Eyles et al. 1994; Evans et al. 1995), and this late \nice has been linked to Heinrich 1 forcing (McCabe et al. 2005).  The coast-\nof the ice has also been linked to deflection of the BIIS by Fennoscandian ice in \nSea but this remains unproved.  During deglaciation it is also apparent that \nice from the North Sea lobe resulted in the formation of regionally extensive \nlakes Wear, Tees, Pickering and Humber (Bateman et al. 2007), but the ice \nINTERLOBATE ICE SHEET DYNAMICS DURING THE LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM AT WHITBURN BAY. \nWHITBURN BAY. \n 2 \ntheir formation are poorly constrained.  Furthermore, there is little \nchronological control on the glacial sediments associated with both the advance \nphases of the BIIS in this area. \nThis paper aims to reconstruct the glacial processes operating during the LGM \nalong the Durham coastline.  Firstly, it uses macroscale and microscale \nlithofacies analysis to reconstruct the subglacial and marginal processes \noccurring during ice sheet advance and recession.  Secondly, the paper seeks to \ndetermine the patterns and phasing of ice flow in the region using lithological, \nand heavy mineral and palynological provenancing techniques.  Thirdly, the \npaper considers the glacial landsystem operating along the east coast during the \nLGM and evaluates the evidence for a surging ice lobe in the North Sea.  Finally, \nthe implications of this research for our understanding of regional Quaternary \nstratigraphic correlation are considered. \n \n1.2 Interlobate Ice Sheet History and Glacial Lake Wear \n The pattern of Late Devensian ice movement in Northumberland and Co. \nDurham involved several interacting ice lobes of fluctuating dominance.  \nWhitburn Bay is located in the area where these ice lobes interacted with each \nother and with regional proglacial lakes, making it a crucial area for \nunderstanding ice sheet flow dynamics and phasing during the LGM.   \n In eastern Northumberland and county Durham, there is extensive \nevidence of a first ice lobe passing through the Tyne Gap bearing Lake District \nerratics and moving in an easterly direction.  Drumlin fields in western \nNorthumberland support this (Douglas, 1991). This lobe was confluent with, and \nlater displaced by, ice bearing Cheviot erratics which moved parallel to the coast \n(Douglas, 1991).  This North Sea Lobe surged down the eastern coast of Britain, \nshowing a tendency to move south-westwards, as in the Esk Valley, Robin \nHood\u2019s Bay, the Vale of Pickering and at Holderness (Catt 1991a).   \nTrechmann (1915) was the first to suggest the existence of two LGM tills \nthroughout Co. Durham.  These tills are well exposed in the coastal cliffs of Co. \nDurham, where they cap the local Magnesian Limestone bedrock (Smith 1994; \nSmith & Francis 1967; Bridgland 1999).  Within the lower, Blackhall Till (Francis \n1972), striations and clast macrofabrics indicate a strong west to east movement \n(Lunn 1995), with ice moving south-eastwards across eastern Co. Durham from \nsources in the Pennines, the Lake District and the Southern Uplands (Beaumont \n1967).  Outlet glaciers entered the Durham area via the Tyne Gap.  In the early \nstages, this Lake District ice coalesced with a Weardale Glacier to form a \npiedmont lobe glacier in northern Durham (Gaunt 1981).  At maximum glaciation, \nit was probably coalescent with both Scandinavian ice offshore and Tees ice \nmoving over the Stainmore depression in the south (Beaumont 1967).   \nFrancis (1972) correlated the Blackhall Till with the Skipsea Till in the Holderness \n(Madgett & Catt 1978) the type locality of the LGM in Britain, where it overlies the \nSilts, dated to 21475-22140 cal. Yr BP (Bateman et al. 2007).  The glaciofluvial \nINTERLOBATE ICE SHEET DYNAMICS DURING THE LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM AT WHITBURN BAY. \nWHITBURN BAY. \n 3 \noverlie the Blackhall Till, and are overlain by the Horden Till (Francis 1972).  A \nfocussed on the genesis of the Horden Till.  Catt (1966) proposed a tiered, \nthe Horden and Blackhall tills representing the dirty basal parts of two \nsheets.  However, the Horden Till is more likely to be a basal till from an ice \nthe Blackhall Till after the recession of Lake District ice (Beaumont 1967).  \nThe Horden Till has a very localised distribution, and does not extend much \nfurther west than the Durham coastline, supporting the notion that it was probably \ndeposited by a Late Devensian North Sea Lobe, sourced from the Cheviots and \nthe Firth of Forth.  It passed the coast of north-east England and extended along \nthe Yorkshire coast, before terminating on the north-eastern fringe of Norfolk \n(Teasdale & Hughes 1999; Bouton & Hagdorn 2006).  This pattern may reflect \nthe presence of Scandinavian ice in the North Sea basin blocking the eastward \nflow of the North Sea lobe (Carr et al. 2006).   \nThe offshore evidence for the North Sea Lobe is extensive.  During the \ndeposition of the Bolders Bank and Wee Bankie Formations, ice streams flowed \nsouth-eastwards from southern Scotland, piercing the western edge of the \nDogger Bank and extending as a lobe across the southern North Sea (Carr \n1999).  The Bolders Bank till has been correlated with the Skipsea Till of \nYorkshire (Cameron et al. 1992), and is therefore suggested to be younger than \n18 ka BP (Rose 1985).   \n Glacial Lake Wear (Raistrick 1931) resulted from eastward flowing \nmeltwater being trapped between the North Sea Lobes and the Pennine uplands \nto the west (Smith 1994; Lunn 1995).  It was the largest of a series of ice-\ndammed lakes (Hughes & Teasdale 1999), and stood at different levels as \noutlets opened and closed during deglaciation.  The lowlands around Sunderland \nand Newcastle were at one time almost entirely covered by this lake, in which the \nwidespread Tyne-Wear Complex (Smith 1994) deposits were laid down, \nconsisting mostly of laminated clays (Catt 1991b).  These were later termed the \nDurham Member by Thomas (1999).  They range from interbedded laminated \nsilty clays and clayey silts up to 55m thick and extending up to 132m OD (Evans \net al. 2005), to proximal proglacial gravels (Smith & Francis 1967).  Finer \nfractions successively overlap the coarser fractions northwards, marking ice lobe \nrecession.  These glaciolacustrine sequences (Evans et al. 2005) overlie the \nBlackhall Till member.  Towards the coast, the Horden Till (Catt 2007) overlies \nthis earlier till.  Whitburn  (Figure 1) is an important site as it exposes both of \nthese members, and was a focal point for ice emanating from the Lake District \nand from the Southern Uplands and the Cheviots. \n \n2.

Durham, south of South Shields \n(Figure 1), glacigenic sediments are well exposed above the Magnesian \nLimestone bedrock (Figure 3).  Lithofacies Associations 1 and 2 are \nsuperimposed lower and upper diamictons.  Incised into Lithofacies Association 2 \nare units of laminated sand and clay, rippled sand, and bedded coarse sand and \ngravel, which constitute Lithofacies Association 3.   \n \n3.2 Lithofacies Association 1: A massive, matrix supported diamicton. \n Lithofacies Association 1 (LFa 1), the lower diamicton, is inconsistently \nBay, but is well exposed in Sections 1, 2, 3 and 6 (Figures 3, 4, 5).  It is a brown, \nconsolidated, gravel-rich diamicton capped with a boulder or cobble pavement \ndirectly on Magnesian Limestone bedrock.  Contacts are sharp, unconformable \nThe diamict contains faceted, striated pebbles, and erratic materal (e.g. coal and \nFormatted: Font: Italic\nFormatted: Font: Italic\nFormatted: Line spacing:  single\nINTERLOBATE ICE SHEET DYNAMICS DURING THE LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM AT WHITBURN BAY. \nWHITBURN BAY. \n 5 \npebbles).  The clast fabric has low dip angles and a moderately strong clustering \nfrom NW to SE (Figure 5).   \n \n3.2.1 Lithofacies Association 1 Thin Section Analysis \n Three samples of LFa 1 were taken from Section 1.  Sample 1-1 was \nfrom the base of LFa 1, and 1-2 is from the middle of LFa 1.  In thin section, \nSample 1-1 is a light brown, matrix-supported, massive diamicton of even density \n(Table 1).  Rotations and Type II Pebbles are common, and there is a strong \nskelsepic plasmic fabric.  Sample 1-2 has a massive, brown, diamict matrix.  The \nskeleton grains are matrix supported and poorly sorted.  Larger skeleton grains \nwithin matrix exhibit edge-rounding; smaller grains are generally angular.  \nElongated grains are commonly lineated and aligned.  The plasmic fabric (Table \n1) is very localised and patchy, with a strong skelsepic plasmic fabric around \nlarger skeleton grains.   \n Sample 1-3 was taken from the boundary between LFa1 and LFa 2 \n(Table 1) at Section 1.  On macroscopic inspection, the slide is a brown, silty, \nmatrix-supported diamicton.   It has many rounded or sub-rounded skeleton \ngrains.  A band of lighter coloured, less dense matrix divides the slide into three \ndistinct areas, and the matrix material here is folded and deformed.  The contacts \nbetween the three zones are sharp.  There are rare microfossils, possibly \nassociated with the limestone clasts present.  Convoluted, swirling structures are \napparent, and are associated with boudinage structures.  The top and bottom \nzones contain strong rotational structures with associated pressure shadows, \nlineations, and Type II and III pebbles.  Small numbers of crushed grains are also \npresent.  Necking structures between grains are apparent.  FIGURE? \n \n3.2.2 The Boulder Pavement \nA boulder pavement occurs consistently at the top of LFa 1 and is laterally \nextensive across Whitburn Bay.  At Section 1 it consists of well faceted, striated \nboulders up to 50cm across, and extends for 20m (Figure 5).  The spacing \nbetween the boulders here ranges from a few centimetres up to 60 \ncmentimetres.  The boulders are flat and polished on their upper surfaces and \nare either horizontally orientated or dip to the NNW.  The mean dip direction of \nthe boulders is 141\u00b0 and the mean dip is 8.5\u00b0.  The upper surfaces of the \nboulders are predominantly striated in a NNE to SSW direction.  Some boulders \nexhibit multiple striae directions, with a dominant upper set and a fainter lower \nset.  The lower set are striated in a NW to SE direction.  Lithologically, the \nboulder pavement consists of Pennine and local rocks, including Carboniferous \nlimestone, sandstone and Magnesian limestone.  Between, above and around \nthe boulders at Section 1 there are some channelised, massive, poorly sorted \ngravels with a sharp, undulating lower contact. \n \nINTERLOBATE ICE SHEET DYNAMICS DURING THE LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM AT WHITBURN BAY. \nWHITBURN BAY. \n 6 \n3.3  Lithofacies Association 2: A massive, matrix-supported diamicton \n LFa 2 is a dark brown, over-consolidated, matrix-supported, gravel-poor \ndiamicton.  Its rare gravel clasts range from subangular to angular, and are \nfaceted and striated.  Clast fabrics indicate a moderate orientation from the NNE \nto SSW.  At Section 10, LFa 2 overlies a localised, massive, poorly sorted coarse \nsand (Unit 1) containing common angular fine to coarse gravel and cobbles \n(Figures 6 and 7).  It has an erosive, undulating lower contact and a scoured \nupper contact.  LFa 2 contains far-travelled, striated clasts with faceted sides, \nranging from fine gravel to cobble size.  The erratic suite includes Cheviot \nporphyries and granites, Old Red Sandstone, Carboniferous Limestone; and \nGreywacke, schist, rhyolite and arkose sandstone from the Southern Uplands.   \nAt Section 2a, 20m north of Section 1, LFa 1 and LFa 2 are exposed in \nsuperposition, with LFa 2 exhibiting a number of overturned pipe structures \n(Figure 8).  LFa 2 is then unconformably overlain by a fine, well sorted, thinly \nbedded sand with a convex base. \n \n3.3.1   Lithofacies  Association 2: Thin Section Analysis. \n Sample 1-4 was taken from the upper diamicton (LFa 2) at Section 1.  It is \na dense, dark brown diamicton, with a small number of sub-rounded to rounded, \nmatrix-supported skeleton grains, predominantly in the fine sand to silt size \nfraction (Table 1).  Numerous smaller angular flakes and coal grains are evenly \ndistributed across the slide.   \nAt Section 10 LFa 2 directly overlies bedrock, and sample 10-1 along this \ninterface shows a highly variable structure (Table 1).  The limestone bedrock is \nclearly seen to be drawn up into the diamicton, and matrix material has also been \ninjected downwards into the limestone (Figure 9).  Aligned clay particles along \nthe boundary indicate shearing.  The diamicton is weakly stratified, and contains \nnumerous rotational structures, Type II Pebbles, and is strongly birefringent.  \nSkeleton grains include coal, siltstone, sandstone and limestone lithologies.  \nAligned skeleton grains are common.   \n \n3.4 Lithofacies Association 3: Stratified gravels, sands and fines.   \nA number of units of sand and gravel, and of bedded sand, silt and clay, are \npersistently exposed in Whitburn Bay.  These units occur at various heights \nthroughout the section.   \n \n3.4.1 Lithofacies Association 3: Coarse sand and Gravel \n At Section 5, LFa 2 is vertically dissected by medium to coarse rudaceous \nunderstood that \u2018rudaceous\u2019 is a rather outmoded term) clast-supported gravel \nerosive contacts (LFa 3) (Figure 10).  Smaller dykes occur as offshoots from the \nThe clastic dykes have clear-cut, sharply erosive boundaries.  In the middle of \ngravels, there is an infill of fine, thinly bedded sands (Unit 3, LFa 3), which are \nINTERLOBATE ICE SHEET DYNAMICS DURING THE LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM AT WHITBURN BAY. \nWHITBURN BAY. \n 7 \nand contorted.  Above the dykes, rudaceous gravels fan up and out into the \nunit and into coarsely bedded gravels (Unit 4, LFa 3).  The lithologies of the \nthose of the underlying diamicton, with Magnesian limestone the most abundant \nIntraclasts of diamicton occur commonly within the gravels.   \nAt Section 6, a coarse, poorly sorted, bedded sand and gravel is also well \nexposed, and displays a channelised form.  They have a sharp, erosive, \nundulating bottom contact and a flat, sharp, upper contact.   \n \n3.4.2.  Lithofacies Association 3: Rippled sands and laminated sand and \nclay.  At many locations, laminated and draped-rippled sands and clays are incised into \nLFa 2, and outcrop in cross-section as nested channel forms with concave basal \ncontacts and flat tops (Figure 11).  At Section 9a 20 cm of coarse, poorly sorted \nsand and gravel rest directly on bedrock, and are overlain by 0.75m of planar \nlaminated, well sorted fine sand with a sharp lower contact.  Above this is a \nyellowish-brown, well sorted fine sand with Type A climbing ripples and \ngradational lower contacts (Unit 2, LFa 3).  Next in the sequence are 60 cm of \nrippled sands with preserved stoss-side laminations and planar bedded sand and \nclay (Unit 5, LFa 3).  The repeated change between planar bedded sands and \nType B climbing ripples represents fluctuating flow, with the Type B ripples \nindicating slowly migrating ripples with high vertical aggradation rates (c.f. Ashley \n1995).  A dark brown diamicton with sheared and sharp, erosive lower contacts \n(LFa 2), caps the sequence. \nAt Section 9d (Figure 11), LFa 1 is overlain by one metre of heavily deformed \nsand with recumbent folds, overfolds, and convolute lamination (Unit 2; LFa 3).  \nThe sand unit has a sharp, scoured lower contact with a pebble lag near the \nbase and a thick planar bed of clay half way up Unit 2, which is overlain by Type \nA climbing ripples.  The lower contact with Unit 1 is sharp, but the upper contacts \nare gradational.  This unit is overlain by massive fine sand with occasional coal \nplanar laminations (Unit 3; LFa 3).  In Unit 4 (LFa 3), clay and sand laminations \nare strongly folded and anastomosed into overfolds and recumbent folds.  There \nare also massive, homogenised clay inclusions.

Geochemical Analysis \n4.1 Lithofacies Association 1 \n Five bulk and gravel samples were analysed from LFa 1.  The samples \nreacted vigorously to 10% hydrochloric acid.  Metals analysis reveals it is high in \nsodium, magnesium, aluminium, potassium, calcium, iron, manganese and \ntitanium.    \n Magnesian Limestone dominates LFa 1, with Carboniferous limestone \npresent in small amounts.  There are also relatively low amounts of Whin Sill \ndolerite erratics, and very low amounts of quartz and other igneous material.  \nOther rare erratic clasts within LFa 1 include Old Red Sandstone, greywackes, \nand coal (Table 5).  Old Red Sandstone outcrops in the northern and western \nLake District and in the Southern Uplands (Johnson 1995).  The Carboniferous \nCoal Measures, sourcing sandstones and coal, are located immediately to the \nwest and north east.   \n The most prominent heavy mineral is dolomite.  The far travelled suite \ncontains an abundance of medium-grade metamorphic minerals such as \nclinozoisite, andalusite, kyanite, garnet and olivine.  Biotite and tourmaline, \ncommon in many igneous rocks, are also present.   \n \n4.2 Lithofacies Association 2 \nSeven bulk and clast samples were taken from LFa 2 (Table 2).  This lithofacies \nhas a weak to moderate reaction to hydrochloric acid.  It is poorer in Magnesian \nlimestone and richer in Carboniferous limestone than LFa 1 (Table 5).  There are \nsubstantially higher percentages of igneous clasts present, including pink \nporphyries, rhyolites and granites, together with Whin Sill dolerite.  The pink \nrhyolites are typical of the Cheviots region. \nLFa 2 has significant amounts of kyanite, rutile, clinopyroxenes, and baryte \n(Table 4).  Detrital rutile is sourced from high grade, regionally metamorphosed \nterrains.  Amphiboles and hornblendes are also likely to be sourced from \ncrystalline bedrock.   \n Palynological analysis indicates thatshows abundant kerogen, wood \npreserved palynomorphs awere present, with lower proportions of non-woody \npalynomorphs, entirely of Carboniferous age, are dominated by the long-ranging \nDensosporites and Lycospora pusilla.

It is a \nyellowish brown well sorted sand (Table 2), which reacts vigorously to \nhydrochloric acid.  The sand facies is rich in high grade metamorphic minerals, \nsuch as rutile, clinopyroxenes and amphiboles (Tables 4 and 5).   \n \n5. Interpretation \n5.1 Lithofacies Association 1: massive, matrix-supported diamicton. \n Lithofacies Association 1 has the macro-scale characteristics of a \nsubglacial till (Carr 2001).  These include striated, far-travelled, faceted clasts, \nfar-travelled heavy minerals, an over-consolidated, matrix-supported diamicton, \nand well-orientated, clustered clast fabrics (Evans et al. 2006; Benn & Evans \n1998).  A comparison of LFa 1 and LFa 2 shows that locally sourced, non-\ndurable clasts dominate LFa 1.  LFa 2 has a more significant component of far \ntravelled clasts, including igneous erratics (Figure 13). \nThe micromorphological analysis supports a genesis as a subglacial till.  \nRotational structures, rounded Type II and III Pebbles, and skelsepic plasmic \nfabrics denote ductile deformation (van der Meer 1997) and grain rotation in a till \nmatrix (van der Meer 1997; Nelson et al. 2005).  The rotation of skeleton grains \nhas caused preferential alignment of clay particles (Roberts & Hart 2005), \nthrough the transmission of stress perpendicular to the particle edges.  Masepic \nplasmic fabrics, lineations of grains and crushed grains imply high strain and \npressure in a brittle environment (Menzies 2000).  The combination of both brittle \nand ductile deformation structures suggests polyphase deformation.  The \ncommon turbate structures, and the lack of flow structures, marbling and tile \nstructures, precludes a genesis as a mass movement or debris flow (Carr 2001; \nMenzies & Zaniewski 2003). \nSample 1-3, from the junction between LFa 1 and LFa 2 at Section 1, could show \nd\u00e9collement plane, where the upper till has slid over the lower till in the \nenvironment (as demonstrated by van der Meer et al. 2003).  It contains micro-\nescape structures that have been subsequently deformed.  The two varieties of \n(bimasepic) plasmic fabric indicates strong shear in two directions.

These soft sediment clasts could indicate \nexisting sediments. \nLFa 1 is interpreted as a terrestrial subglacial hybrid till, or traction till (Evans et \nal. 2006); with evidence for both lodgement and deformation, which varied \nspatially throughout Whitburn Bay (as also noted by Lunkka in Norfolk in 1994; \nNelson et al. 2005).  The striated, lodged clasts with well defined stoss and lee \nends, and the lodged boulder pavement, are indicative of lodgement.  In contrast, \nmany other sections demonstrate structures indicative of extensional \ndeformation, such as stringer initiation, low clast fabrics, massive, homogenous \nsections, and micromorphological evidence of extensive ductile deformation. \n \n5.2 The Boulder Pavement \nThe boulder pavement occurs at the top of the lower till.  Striations and clast \nfabrics are consistent with LFa 2, indicating that the boulders were overridden by \nthe second phase of ice flow.  There are several theories of boulder pavement \nformation, ranging from lodgement, deformation and a continuum between them.  \nBoulton and Paul (1976) propose a \u2018traffic jam\u2019 mechanism for boulder pavement \nformation, where boulders build up behind lodged clasts.  These stones form a \nnucleation point behind which other stones cluster.  The lodgement of clasts on a \nsoft bed involves the ploughing up of the deformable substrate so that it forms a \nprow, which arrests the forward movement of the clast.  Large clasts are \npreferentially lodged, forming an obstacle to the further movement of such clasts, \nand creating clusters or pavements (Evans et al. 2006).  After lodgement, the \nboulders are extensively abraded, which truncates and striates the upper \nsurfaces.  The presence of the boulder pavement may aid sliding and fast flow. \nClark (1991), van der Wateren (1999) and Glasser et al (2001) argue that striated \nboulder pavements form when boulders settle to the base of a weak deforming \nsediment.  The overriding deforming sediment then abrades them.   \nJ\u00f8rgensen and Piotrowski (2003) counter-argue that a boulder pavement is an \nerosional surface, which can indicate truncation and removal of lower sediments.  \nBoulder pavements typically have flat, polished upper surfaces with unidirectional \nstriations, and are strongly faceted.  Lodgement and extensive abrasion by the \nsole of the ice sheet truncates, orientates and striates the upper surfaces of the \nboulder pavements (J\u00f8rgensen & Piotrowski 2003).   \nHicock (1991) favours a combination of lodgement, deformation, melt-out and \nerosion.  He proposes a continuum of pavement-forming processes, from \ndeformation-dominated to lodgement-dominated pavements.  Boulton (1996) \nmaintains that during erosion of the till down to the A\/B interface, dense clasts, \non being exposed, resist being drawn into glacier flow and remain immediately \nabove the \u2018descending A\/B interface, thus concentrating larger clasts from the \nmobilised till at the A\/B interface\u2019.    \nINTERLOBATE ICE SHEET DYNAMICS DURING THE LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM AT WHITBURN BAY. \nWHITBURN BAY. \n 11 \nThe pavement at Whitburn may represent an erosional lag formed within a \ndeforming bed (Figure 14).  As the boulders are orientated and striated strongly \nin one direction, it is unlikely that they have sunk through the deforming layer, as \nthis would lead to multiple striae directions and to rotation of clasts (J\u00f8rgensen & \nPiotrowski 2003).  It is more likely that the boulders melted out from the base of \nthe ice sheet, possibly during a phase of ice quiescence related to a switch in ice \nflow direction, and where then lodged into the deforming substrate as ice \nmovement was reactivated, causing striation and faceting before eventual burial \nby till deposition (LFa 2).  \n \n5.3 Lithofacies Association 2: massive, matrix-supported diamicton. \nFaceted, striated, far travelled clasts, and the over-consolidated nature of the \ndiamicton, indicate that LFa 2 is also a subglacial till.  The variable presence of \nLFa 1 indicates that either extensive deformation has homogenised the two tills, \nor the later ice advance has eroded the lower lithofacies.  Clast fabrics and \nstriations indicate general ice movement from the north-west to south east.  The \nlow and variable S1 values from the clast fabrics suggest extensive deformation \n(c.f. Evans et al. 2006).  Hart (2007) argues that weak clast fabric strengths \nreflect clast interaction and a dominance of deformation and rotation, and \nfurthermore that high grain size and low sorting emphases rotation, leading to \nlow clast fabric strength in subglacial diamicts.   \nAt Section 2a, the overturned pipe structures are evidence of the squeezing of \nthe soft, saturated LFa 1 into LFa 2 under a high ice overburden pressure (Figure \n15).  They are overturned to the south east, supporting this direction of ice flow.  \nThe preservation of these features is indicative of lower strain rates at this point. \nMicromorphological analysis of LFa 2 reveals numerous micro-scale \ndeformational structures, such as circular structures with associated skelsepic \nfabrics, aligned grains and grain lineations (Figure 9).  Elongate grains near the \nshear plane have rotated until they are aligned plane-parallel.  Crushed grains \nand strong masepic plasmic fabrics indicate pervasive strain and high pressure.  \nThese features are indicative of subglacial deposition and deformation (van der \nMeer 1997; Carr 2001).  Sample 10-1 shows in detail the junction of the LFa 2 \ndiamicton with the underlying bedrock, and further supports a subglacial till \ninterpretation, based on the strong presence of circular structures, crushed \ngrains, Type II pebbles, and a strong plasmic fabric.  At a macroscale, the \nMagnesian Limestone bedrock has been entrained into the till with evidence of \nstringer formation and cannibalisation of the lower soft, dolomitic bedrock.   \nThe erosion or incorporation of LFa 1 into LFa 2, for example at Sections 5 and \n10, suggests that LFa 2 is a subglacial traction till (Evans et al. 2006), but the \nhighly variable and often low clast fabric strengths, as well as the preservation of \nthe pipe structures and canal fills suggest a low strain deformation signature.  \nThese features have a low preservation potential, and are unlikely to have \nsurvived the process of lodgement (Nelson et al. 2005).   \nINTERLOBATE ICE SHEET DYNAMICS DURING THE LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM AT WHITBURN BAY. \nWHITBURN BAY. \n 12 \nThe localised lense of chaotically sorted sand and gravel at the base of the \ndiamicton at Section 10 represents a narrow channel.  The deposition of this \nwaterlain deposit at the bedrock\/till interface may relate to the separation of the \ntill and bedrock. \nUltimately, LFa 1 and LFa 2 represent a mosaic of processes operating \nsubglacially at the time of sediment deposition, at both the macro- and the micro-\nscale (c.f. Piotrowski et al. 2004).  The location of deforming spots could be \ncontrolled by the capacity of the bed to evacuate pore water (c.f. Boulton et al. \n2001).  Areas of low permeability and high water pressure will deform first \n(Piotrowski et al. 2004).  Multiple switches in different modes of deposition and \ndeformation resulted in the variable appearance of the two tills and the boulder \npavement at Whitburn Bay (c.f. Piotrowski et al. 2004; Piotrowski et al. 2006).    \n \n5.4 Lithofacies Association 3: Sand and gravel facies. \nThe gravel dykes at Section 5 are interpreted as the result of high-pressure fluid \nescape beneath the ice sheet; i.e., as hydrofracture fills.  These sub-vertical \nclastic dykes are traditionally interpreted as the product of the escape of \npressurised groundwater (Evans et al. 2006).  Tensional cracks are infilled by \nsediment fluidised by the escaping water (Figure 16).  These hydrofractures \noccur where fluid pressure exceeds the tensile strength of the sediment and the \nsmallest component of the ice overburden pressure (Rijsdijk et al. 1999).  \nJuxtaposed thinly bedded, calcreted sands, and coarse, well sorted gravel \nindicates variable flow regimes.   \nAt Whitburn Bay, subglacial meltwater would have discharged into the \nMagnesian Limestone aquifer.  The overlying tills acted as aquiludes, \nhydraulically confining the bedrock (as also observed by Rijsdijk et al. 1999 at \nKilliney Bay, Ireland).  When the supply of meltwater exceeded the capacity of \nthe bedrock aquifer, water pressures rose beneath the overlying till.  When the \nwater pressure exceeded the tensile strength of the till, it caused tensile \nfracturing, which enabled hydrofracturing (Figure 16).  The discharge of water \nwas sufficient to fluidise the sands and gravels, transport them through the \nhydrofracture and inject them into the overlying sediments.  Subsequent \nglaciotectonism further deformed these contorted beds.  A high percentage of \ncalcium carbonate in the ground water, derived from the Magnesian limestone \nbedrock, resulted in calcretion of the gravels.   \nThe gravel channel at Section 7 is a high energy subglacial Nye channel.  The \nwell sorted cobble gravel, with an undulating lower contact and a flat, eroded \nupper contact, lacks the internal structures associated with subaerial fluvial \nsystems (c.f. Lunkka 1994).  These channels were discreet, hydraulically \nefficient, channelised systems which were effective at evacuating subglacial \nmeltwater.  They are highly erosive and incised into the deforming layer.   \n \n5.5 Lithofacies Association 3: Laminated sand and clay facies. \nINTERLOBATE ICE SHEET DYNAMICS DURING THE LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM AT WHITBURN BAY. \nWHITBURN BAY. \n 13 \nThe sand and clay bed at Section 2b contains laminated and thinly bedded well \nsorted sand and clay, indicating deposition in a low energy fluvial environment.  \nThe laminated sand and clay beds have closed edges, flat tops, and undulating, \nconvex bottom contacts, indicating that they were incised into the diamicton, \nperhaps in a period of higher energy flow (van der Meer et al. 2003).  The \nlaminations are locally strongly deformed and contain water escape structures.  \nLoad and flame structures can indicate deformation and remobilisation of water-\nsaturated beds, and can suggest rapid deposition (Glasser et al. 2001) or a high \noverburden pressure.  The recumbent folds and overfolds are indicative of \nsecondary glaciotectonism. \nSection 9a exhibits Type A climbing ripples, indicating fast flowing water and \nrapidly migrating ripples.  These are overlain by alternating sand and clay planar \nlaminations, representing periods of fast flowing water and periods of suspension \nsettling under low- or no-flow conditions, indicating periodical quiescence of the \nchannel and little sediment input (c.f. Ashley & Smith 1985; Ashley et al. 1982).   \nMicromorphological analysis of the thin section samples obtained at Section 9a \nsupports a fluvial genesis for the sands, followed by glaciotectonism.  Samples \n9a-1 and 9a-2 are crudely bedded with numerous grain lineations and contain \nclimbing ripples.  The presence of a masepic plasmic fabric could be a primary \ndepositional feature.  The extensive deformation of the primary bedding in \nSample 9a-4 indicates pervasive shear, and the erosion and incorporation of bed \nmaterial; with structures such as rip-up clasts, boudins and strong plasmic fabrics \ncommonly seen.  In times of very low or no flow the clay laminae were deposited, \nreflecting quiescence and ponding events.  The presence of sand grains in the \nclay laminae suggests that these are micro-dropstones formed in a \nglaciolacustrine environment, by melt-out from the overlying ice.   \nThese isolated channelised forms, with concave-up bases and flat tops, and the \nstrong variation in height of these channels, argues against a proglacial origin.  \nDistal proglacial sandur systems are characterised by trough cross-bedded, \ncyclic fining-upward sequences of gravels, sands and silts with slip face \nmigration of longitudinal and linguoid braid bars.  This gives rise to planar cross-\nbeds, with abundant ripple-drift and cross-lamination (Maizels 1995).  Distal \nproglacial outwash sediments typically exhibit megaripple migration on point-bar \nsurfaces, producing large scale trough cross-beds.  The lack of bars, dunes and \ntabular bedding in the Whitburn channels systems suggests that they are \nsubglacial glaciofluvial sediments (Collinson 1996).  We interpret them as a low \nenergy subglacial braided canal network, as defined by Walder & Fowler (1994), \nwhich was active beneath the ice sheet that formed the traction tills.   \nThis type of distributed subglacial drainage system is inefficient, and can result in \nflows and ponding beneath the ice sheet.  Braided canal systems are effective \nflow cannot evacuate all the excess water in the system (Benn & Evans 1996).  \nhave long been recognised in the geological record as broad lenses of sorted \ntills with concave-up lower contacts and nearly planar upper contacts (for \nINTERLOBATE ICE SHEET DYNAMICS DURING THE LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM AT WHITBURN BAY. \nWHITBURN BAY. \n 14 \nal. 1986; Lunkka 1994; Shaw 1987).  Englacial conduits are recognised to rarely \nthan 200m into the ice sheet (Piotrowski et al. 2006), indicating that Whitburn \nice marginal environment.  Ductile deformation, despite the high drainage \nwould therefore have occurred close to the ice margin under low cryostatic \nSwift et al. (2002) argued that seasonal reorganisation of subglacial drainage can \noccur beneath many temperate and polythermal glaciers, resulting in distributed \nand channelised configurations, with the development of a hydraulically efficient, \nchannelised subglacial drainage system during the ablation season.  This would \ninvolve higher pressure, channelised, faster flowing canals (such as Section 7) \nand slower moving, lower energy, distributed drainage systems (such as Section \n9) evolving throughout the year.  These lower energy channels also demonstrate \nflow variability at smaller scales, with evidence of periodic quiescence and \nponding, as well as periods of faster flow, demonstrated by Type A and B \nclimbing ripples and planar lamination. \nHigh porewater pressure, as evidenced by hydrofracturing and extensive till \ndeformation results in an excess of water at the ice sole, and may induce basal \ndecoupling and the formation of englacial canals.  These drain porewater, raising \nof the shear strength of the surrounding sediments (Piotrowski et al. 2006).  This \ncan contribute to \u2018sticky spot\u2019 development, of areas of both high and low \ndeformation, changing through space and time.   \nLithofacies Association 3 therefore demonstrates fluctuations of meltwater \ndischarge at multiple scales.  Seasonal changes in meltwater discharge are \ncapable of driving the sedimentological signal.  An alternative explanation for the \nlaminated clay and sand facies at Whitburn Bay could be backfilling of the canals \nduring times of low or no flow, related to ice marginal lake level fluctuations.  \nThere is extensive evidence of proglacial lakes in Co. Durham and Yorkshire \n(Gaunt 1981).  During periods of low lake levels, high submarginal discharge in \nthese channels would have resulted in the deposition of rippled and bedded \nsands, but during periods of high ice marginal lake levels, backfilling of the \nchannels will have caused ponding and clay drape lamination.  The canal fills \ncould thus be related to the activity of local lakes such as Glacial Lake Wear.  \nIndeed, episodic changing lake levels, related to both seasonal variations in \nmeltwater and the movement of ice lobes, have been suggested in Glacial Lake \nWear (Gaunt 1981).  Fluctuating lake levels could also explain why this signal is \nrepeated in all channels at variable heights along the Whitburn site.   \n \n6. Provenance of the Whitburn Bay tills \nOld Red Sandstone is perhaps the most useful lithology for provenance testing \nit outcrops in the northern and western Lake District and in the Southern Uplands \n1995).  Carboniferous Limestone outcrops in the north and south Lake District, in \nNorthumberland Basin between the Alston Block, and in the Southern Uplands \nINTERLOBATE ICE SHEET DYNAMICS DURING THE LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM AT WHITBURN BAY. \nWHITBURN BAY. \n 15 \nSill dolerite is a local Permian intrusive igneous rock, which outcrops to the north \narea.  The Carboniferous Coal Measures immediately to the west and north of \nare sources for the coal and sandstones of LFa 1 (Figure 2).  The assemblage of \nCarboniferous and Permian erratics indicates a locally derived till.  Clast fabric \norientations support an east-west direction of ice movement. \nLFa 1 is high in clinozoisite, andalusite, kyanite, garnet and olivine.  Clinozoisite \nis a product of low to medium grade metamorphism, and is common in some \nschists.  Some basic igneous rocks may also contain clinozoisite.  Andalusite and \nkyanite are metamorphic minerals, common in contact aureoloes around igneous \nintrusions and in gneisses and schists.  Olivines are the principle components of \nmany basic igneous rocks (Mange & Maurer 1992).  The presence of \nmetamorphic and igneous-derived minerals in LFa 1 suggests that the matrix \nwas sourced from further afield, and perhaps from igneous and lower grade \nmetamorphic complexes in the Lake District. \nRatios of apatite to tourmaline, garnet to zircon, rutile to zircon, and spinel to \nzircon are also useful in reflecting source characteristics. These data indicate \nthat the two tills at Whitburn Bay have distinctly different sources, as all the \nindices show differences (Figure 17; Morton & Hallsworth 1994).  LFa 1 contains \na number of far-travelled heavy minerals, but few far-travelled igneous clasts.  \nThe clast fabrics and presence of crystalline minerals indicates a source from \nnorthwestern England and the Lake District.  Hence, this first phase of ice \nmovement crossed the Pennines and deposited the lower till. \nA greater proportion of Carboniferous Limestone in LFa 2 compared to LFa 1 \nindicates that LFa 2 has been isolated from the local Permian bedrock by a \nmantle of earlier till (LFa 1), which is widespread in the Durham region \n(Beaumont 1967).  The pink granites, rhyolites and porphyries are distinctive and \nare from the Cheviots.  Greywackes are common in the Southern Uplands, and \nWhin Sill dolerite is located to the west and north of the study area. \nLFa 2 is rich in muscovite, andalusite and kyanite, which are common in schists \nand metamorphic rocks.  Zoisite is generated by medium-grade regional \nmetamorphism, and is a characteristic component of silicate granulites and \nmicaschists.  Regionally metamorphosed terrains are the most common source \nof detrital rutile. Amphiboles such as horneblende and tremolite are present in \nsmall quantities.  These are chemically unstable minerals, derived from \ncrystalline bedrock sources (Lee et al. 2004).  Augitic and diopsidic \nclinopyroxenes are widespread in ultramafic and intermediate igneous rocks, and \nare common in gabbros, dolerites, andesites and basalts, indicating a likely \nsource from eastern Scotland.   \nThe palynomorphlogical assemblages indicates a likely derivation from the \ncoalfield, to the north.  There was no palynological evidence forxpression of the \nLimestone, supporting the interpretations of LFa 2 overriding LFa 1, and having \nthe local Magnesian Limestone bedrock.  However, it should be borne in mind \nINTERLOBATE ICE SHEET DYNAMICS DURING THE LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM AT WHITBURN BAY. \nWHITBURN BAY. \n 16 \nMagnesian Limestone is a relatively organic-poor unit.  Collectively, this evidence \nindicate a source in the Cheviots and Southern Uplands.  A clast fabric indicative \nSSE flow direction supports this.   \n \n7. Discussion \n7.1 Evolution of the glacigenic sequence at Whitburn Bay \nRecent research has highlighted the fact that there is large spatial variability in \nbasal friction below ice sheets, and that glacier beds generally comprise mosaics \nof sliding, deformation, lodgement and ploughing (Nelson et al. 2005; Evans et \nal. 2006; Piotrowski et al. 2004).  Whitburn Bay demonstrates this well, with \nevidence for lodgement in the form of the clast pavements, juxtaposed with \nextensive evidence for deformation and hydrofracturing. \nA multiphase model of land-system development (Figure 18) can be deduced \nfrom glacigenic sediments at Whitburn Bay.  The first phase (Figure 19) involved \nthe arrival of an ice lobe from the west, which deposited LFa 1.  This ice \noriginated in the Lake District and entered eastern England via the Tyne Gap.   \nThe second ice lobe (Figure 19) flowed down the eastern coast of Britain and \ndeflected or obstructed the first.  This North Sea Lobe deposited the Horden Till \nin Co. Durham.  In the offshore area, the Bolders Bank till was deposited.  As it \ncontinued southwards over the varying lithologies in Yorkshire, the North Sea \nLobe entrained local lithologies such as chalk and shale.  This formation is \nyounger than 21475-22140 cal. Yr BP (Cameron et al. 1992; Bateman et al. \n2007).   \n The North Sea Lobe overrode the lower till.  The initiation of the boulder \nhave been triggered by a period of basal ice melting as flow from the west \nlodged and abraded by ice flowing from the north which deposited LFa 2 (Figure \ndistributed subglacial drainage system of braided canals developed beneath the \nhave changed, possibly seasonally, to a discrete, higher pressure drainage \nefficient Nye channels.  Bj\u00f6rnsson (1998) argued that glacial surges and fast ice \nassociated with subglacial distributed drainage systems, because an increase in \npressure, as evidenced by the extensive existence of subglacial canals, can lead \ndecoupling of the ice from its bed (Bj\u00f6rnsson 1998; Evans et al. 2006).

Boulton & Hagdorn (2006) \nargue that model simulations show a powerful ice stream flowing down the \neastern coast of Britain, which bifurcates at its head and pierces the Dogger \nBank as well as one lobe penetrating the Wash embayment.  This damming of \nthe Wash embayment created Glacial Lake Humber.  Recent OSL dates on the \nhigh stand of this lake (Bateman et al. 2007) of 16.6 \u00b1 1.2kyr suggest that the \nBIIS was surging at the western edge of the North Sea Basin during Heinrich 1, \ndepositing the Skipsea Till and the Bolders Bank Formation.  Eyles et al. (1994) \nargue that this east coast ice stream experienced recurrent onshore surging \nagainst the rising bedrock surface of Holderness and Lincolnshire.  Drumlin \nswarms in the valleys of northern England record accelerated ice flow from the \nreservoir regions, and may have been integral parts of the surging system (Eyles \net al. 1994).   \nOther ice streams associated with Heinrich 1 are gradually being recognised in \nBritain (McCabe et al. 2005), and it is now proposed by several researchers that \nthe BIIS was very sensitive to abrupt climate changes in the North Atlantic \nOcean.  A dynamic BIIS was thus characterised by large and rapid fluctuations.  \nClimatic change in the North Atlantic may also have contributed to ice sheet \nreorganisations, with changes in ice flow pathways and centres of ice dispersion.   \n \n7.2 Implications for Quaternary Stratigraphy of Eastern England \nThe locally derived Blackhall Till (LFa 1) at Whitburn Bay was previously \ncorrelated with the Skipsea Till of Holderness (Francis 1972) due to its \nstratigraphical position, but this is disputed on the basis of the provenance data \npresented here.  We favour an origin from ice flowing from the Lake District and \nacross the Pennines through the Tyne Gap.  The Blackhall Till shows a distinct \nwest to east movement, and comprises mainly local clasts.  Previous workers \n(Beaumont 1967) have suggested that it is limited in extent, and there seems to \nbe no equivalent further south.   \nThere has been little detailed geochemical data published on the Skipsea Till.  It \nhas been described as a very dark greyish brown till, containing 32.8-42.4% silt \n(Madgett & Catt 1978).  The Skipsea Till contains chalk, shale, Cheviot \nporphyries, granites, Whin Sill dolerite, Carboniferous and Magnesian limestone, \ncoal and greywackes.  The Skipsea Till is rich in the amphibole and epidote \nheavy minerals, but low in chlorite and biotite heavy minerals.  Thus, the clast \nlithology and the fine sand mineralogy of the Skipsea Till (Madgett & Catt 1978) \nsuggests correlation to the Horden Till (LFa 2).   \nThe macrofabric of LFa 2 at Whitburn Bay and of the Skipsea Till at Holderness \ndeposition by ice moving inland from the North Sea basin.  Ice originated from \nUplands, streamed down the eastern coast of Britain (Eyles et al. 1994), invaded \nINTERLOBATE ICE SHEET DYNAMICS DURING THE LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM AT WHITBURN BAY. \nWHITBURN BAY. \n 18 \nBasin and deposited the Skipsea Till and the Bolders Bank Till (Cameron et al. \n2006).  The movement inland could be due to coalescence of British ice with \noffshore in the North Sea, although it should be noted that Carr et al. (2006) \nand Fennoscandian ice sheets had decoupled by this stage.  Hence, this work \nNorth Sea Lobe flowing south was the second ice lobe to transgress the Durham \nfirst ice body to reach the Holderness coast during the LGM.   \n \n8. Conclusions   \n This research at Whitburn Bay clearly supports the existence of a \ncomplex, interlobate, late Devensian BIIS along the coast of Britain.  LFa 1 and 2 \nrepresent ice flow from two different directions within the same glaciation.  The \nBlackhall Till (LFa 1) originated in north-western England, mainly sourced in the \nLake District.  It is interpreted as a traction till, demonstrating both lodgement and \ndeformation.  The Horden Till (LFa 2) originated in the Southern Uplands and the \nCheviots, and represents an ice lobe flowing down the eastern coast of Britain.  \nThe boulder pavement between the two tills was deposited initially by basal \nmeltout as ice flow from the west waned, and was later lodged and abraded by \nice moving southwards. \n The braided canal system preserved in the Horden Till suggests a low-\nflow subglacial drainage system, juxtaposed with high energy gravel channels, \nreflecting periodical changes in the subglacial drainage hydraulic regime.  \nExtreme changes in subglacial drainage pressure are also supported by the \nexistence of hydrofractures, which may have triggered the development of high \nenergy channels at the ice-bed interface.  The episodic changes from water flow \nto quiescence in these submarginal channels indicates periodic ponding events.  \nThis sedimentological signal could be driven by periodically fluctuating lake levels \nin the proglacial Glacial Lake Wear.  High lake levels would result in backfilling of \nthe channels, quiescence, and the formation of draped lamination.  An increase \nin meltwater or a drop in the lake level would result in the channels \u2018switching on\u2019 \nand discharging into the lake.  Seasonal re-organisations of the subglacial \ndrainage system could result in the juxtaposition of sand and very high energy \ngravel channels. \n The Horden Till may be correlative with the Dimlington Stadial Skipsea \nTill and Bolders Bank Tills in Yorkshire and offshore respectively.  This may \nsuggest that the North Sea ice lobe flowing south was the second ice lobe to \ntransgress the Durham area, but the first ice mass to cross the Holderness coast \nduring the LGM. \n Evidence is mounting for a surging ice stream located on the eastern \ncoast of Britain (Boulton & Hagdorn 2006; Eyles et al. 1994).  Fast ice flow at \nWhitburn Bay is supported by evidence for basal decoupling, extreme \nfluctuations in subglacial porewater pressure, and the presence of wet, slippy, \ndeforming beds.  \n \nINTERLOBATE ICE SHEET DYNAMICS DURING THE LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM AT WHITBURN BAY. \nWHITBURN BAY. \n 19 \nINTERLOBATE ICE SHEET DYNAMICS DURING THE LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM AT WHITBURN BAY. \nWHITBURN BAY. \n 20 \nGlossary of Micromorphology terms \n\uf0b7 Plasmic fabric: the arrangement of clay and silt-sized particles in a \nsample. \uf0b7 Domain: a localized zone displaying a characteristic plasmic fabric. \n\uf0b7 Skelsepic: preferred orientation of plasmic fabric around the surfaces of \nlarger grains: indicates rolling of larger grains.   \n\uf0b7 Lattisepic: preferred orientation of plasmic fabric in two perpendicular \norientations: commonly associated with skelsepic plasmic fabric. \n\uf0b7 Masepic: preferred orientation of plasmic fabric in diffuse domains of \nparallel orientation: indicative of pervasive shearing. \n\uf0b7 Unistrial: preferred orientation of plasmic fabric in discrete parallel \ndomains; indicative of discrete shear. \n\uf0b7 Galaxy \/ rotation structures \/ turbate structures: circular alignments of \ngrains around cores of consolidated sediment or larger grains; indicative of \nrotation. \n\uf0b7 Pressure shadows: symmetric or asymmetric tails of material on the stoss \nand lee of large grains.
