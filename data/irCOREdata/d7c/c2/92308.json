As \narid countries such as Australia and the United States try to find solutions to currently \nexisting droughts, and \u2018wet\u2019 countries such as the United Kingdom contemplate a changing \nwater future in the context of climate change, the types of institutional change that will be \nrequired to balance \u2018supply and demand\u2019 under conditions of complexity and uncertainty is \nbecoming an increasingly salient issue.   \n \nIn \u2018Governing the Tap\u2019 Megan Mullin offers a critique of changes to US water policy that is \nexplicitly politically and institutionally focused. The book presents a US specific case study of \nthe consequences of specialisation and fragmentation of water resource management for \nlocal policy making. It tracks the development of \u2018special districts\u2019 of water management - \npublic authorities that function as administrative bodies, but with a limited, water focused \njurisdiction. This functional specialisation, Mullin argues, can create policy mechanisms that \nare more responsive to the complex problems at hand, but they can also create significant \ndifficulties in governing cooperatively across jurisdictional boundaries. The book focuses on \nthe influence of this specialisation on government decisions, the relationships between \ngovernment and its\u2019 constituents under these arrangements, and the responsiveness of \nthese various specialised systems to community interests. The broader question the book \naddresses, therefore, is how specialised governance can, and in what types of local contexts \nit fails to, effectively coordinate complex regional water-related policy challenges in the US.  \n \nBeyond the examples it provides, the book also offers a brief set of reflections about the \ninstitutional issues underpinning a shift to citizen participation in problem focused policy, \nand the issues of climate change. Special district governance appears to be beneficial in \nsituations where: the problems at hand hold true for the majority of the population; where \na better connection between policy and the public is required on issues that would usually \nstruggle for attention in the political sphere; where policy problems are least severe; and \nwhere a balance is required amongst the multiple and competing visible demands about a \nparticular (resource) conflict. An outcome of this analysis is that special district governance \nis an institutional strategy that provides opportunities for deliberation but not cooperative \npolicy solutions, and reflects policy decisions based on \u2018majority rules\u2019 but not issues of \nequity or sustainability. Given the restricted settings in which fragmented specialisation is \nconsidered beneficial, I was left wondering how useful this concept really is in its ability to \naddress the economic, social and environmental complexities of climate change.  \n \nThe critical reflections on this were limited to a few pages in the final chapter. This served \nonly to highlight a missed opportunity for the book to provide a genuinely critical political \nreflection on the ability of specialisation to address some of the most critical and complex \nchallenges for governments around the world - water management under conditions of \nincreasing scarcity and uncertainty. While I agree with Mullin that some form of localised \neffort is required to address (some) aspects of climate change, I disagree with the implied \nconclusion that special district governance is a flexible way to coordinate this. Taking a \nproblem focus, the integration and coordination required at different scales to implement \nclimate change mitigation and adaptation policies, is at odds with the circumstances in \nwhich Mullin\u2019s describes special district governance as being the most beneficial \u2013 where \nproblems are bounded and fairly simple. Taking an institutional focus, fragmented \nspecialisation may not be possible or in fact desirable in places other than the US. In \ncountries characterised by privatisation and market environmentalism such as the UK, such \na localised approach to water governance (bar widespread institutional and political \nreform), will never be possible. The political history of managing the Murray Darling Basin in \nAustralia shows how the localisation of the politics of water resources is not always \ndesirable. As this example shows, without the proper mechanisms in place to address social, \nenvironmental and economic equity issues that cross jurisdictional boundaries, such a \nlocalised approach can in fact result in severe mismanagement and irreversible \nenvironmental degradation.   \n \nAlthough there may be some examples of success of this approach in the US, such localised \nspecialisation may not accurately address the uncertainties, complexities, and spatial \ninequities of water governance, particularly in the context of climate change. Given this, and \nthe significant lack of engagement with political science and other disciplinary literature \ncritiquing different forms of democracy and governance, the relevance of the book to EPC \nreaders (other than those with a specific interest in US water policy) is fairly limited. \n \n \nAlison L Browne, Lancaster Environment Centre, Lancaster University, Lancaster LA1 4YW, \nUnited Kingdom \n \n"}
