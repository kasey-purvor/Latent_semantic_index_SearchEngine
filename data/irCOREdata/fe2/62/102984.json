Low physical and low psychosocial was\nused as an internal reference group. The exposure criteria were derived from the existing\nepidemiological literature and models for physical and psychosocial work factors. The frequency and\namplitude of lifting and the duration spent sitting while experiencing vibration were used as physical\nexposure criteria. Ordinal values of mental demands, job control, and social support with managers\nand coworkers were used as psychosocial exposure criteria.\nResults: In the multivariate analyses, the highest and significant increase in risk was found in the high\nphysical and high psychosocial exposure group for symptoms of hand or wrist and upper limb disor-\nders after adjusting for years at the job, age, and sex. A potential interaction effect was found for the\nsymptoms of the hand or wrist and upper limb disorders but not for the neck symptoms.\nConclusion: This study showed that workers highly exposed to both physical and psychosocial work-\nplace risk factors were more likely to report symptoms of musculoskeletal disorders than workers highly\nexposed to one or the other. The results suggest an interaction between physical and psychosocial risk\nfactors in the workplace that increased the risk of reporting symptoms in the upper limbs. Psychosocial\nrisk factors at work were more important when exposure to physical risk factors at work were high than\nwhen physical exposure was low. Ergonomic intervention strategies that aim to minimise the risks of\nwork related musculoskeletal disorders of the upper limb should not only focus on physical work factors\nbut also psychosocial work factors.\nCritical reviews have shown that physical and psychoso-cial factors within the workplace are determinants ofmusculoskeletal disorders of the neck and upper\nlimbs.1\u20134 Physical risk factors at work have included the appli-\ncation of force, high repetition, vibration, and awkward work-\ning postures. Psychosocial risk factors at work have included\nintensified workload, time pressure, low job control, monoto-\nnous work, and low support from coworkers and manage-\nment.\nThe contribution of psychosocial risk factors at work in the\naetiology of musculoskeletal disorders of the back, neck, and\nupper limbs may be more important when the risk from expo-\nsure to physical work factors is low according to current, but\nlimited, evidence.5 These limits include the study design of the\ncontemporary epidemiological evidence. These have aimed at\nidentifying the independent effects of each set of factors upon\nmusculoskeletal disorders. However, physical and psychoso-\ncial work factors coexist and may potentially interact to\nincrease risk.A recent epidemiological study on back disorders\nfound that psychosocial risk factors at work increased risk\nwhen workers were highly exposed to physical risk factors at\nwork\u2014that is, an interaction effect between physical and psy-\nchosocial risk factors at work was found such that the relative\nexcess risk from exposure to both sets of factors was greater\nthan the sum of the relative excess risk from high exposure to\nonly one set of factors (either physical or psychosocial).6\nPotential interaction effects (between physical and psychoso-\ncial risk factors at work) and association with musculoskeletal\ndisorders of the neck and upper limbs have not been\nsatisfactorily investigated. Therefore, the aim of this study was\nto investigate the potential interactions between physical and\npsychosocial work related risk factors and symptoms of\nmusculoskeletal disorders of the neck and upper limbs using\nan epidemiological approach. The potential existence of such\ninteractions would have important implications for workplace\nergonomics programmes aimed at reducing the risk of\nmusculoskeletal disorders of the neck and upper limbs.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nThe study design was cross sectional with a study population\ncomprising 1514 male and female workers from 26 randomly\nselected sites of a United Kingdom company.Manual workers,\ndelivery drivers, customer services queries and computer\nworkers and general office staff completed a self administered\nquestionnaire covering personal data and demographics,\nphysical and psychosocial work factors, and musculoskeletal\nsymptoms. The previously validated questionnaire items have\nbeen reported elsewhere.6\nSee end of article for\nauthors\u2019 affiliations\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nCorrespondence to:\nDr Jason Devereux, Robens\nCentre for Health\nErgonomics, European\nInstitute of Health and\nMedical Sciences,\nUniversity of Surrey,\nGuildford, Surrey\nGU2 7TE, UK;\nJ.Devereux@surrey.ac.uk\nAccepted\n17 October 2001\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n269\nwww.occenvmed.com\n group.bmj.com on October 8, 2010 - Published by oem.bmj.comDownloaded from \nData on job title, age, and sex were obtained for each worker\nin the study population from personnel records to compare\nsurvey respondents and non-respondents. The prevalence of\ndisability due to musculoskeletal disorders of the neck and\nupper limbs was obtained from company medical severance\ndata over a 5 year period to investigate any potential healthy\nworker effects. Ethical permission for the cross sectional\nepidemiological study was obtained from the University of\nSurrey committee on ethics.\nExposure classification\nEach worker was classified for physical and psychosocial\nexposure. The four exposure groups were low physical\nexposure and low psychosocial exposure, low physical\nexposure and high psychosocial exposure, high physical expo-\nsure and low psychosocial exposure, and high physical\nexposure and high psychosocial exposure.\nA worker could not be classified into more than one\nexposure group. Workers in the low physical and low psycho-\nsocial exposure group served as an internal reference popula-\ntion for the other three exposure groups.\nWorkers that did not satisfy the criteria for classification\ninto low or high physical exposure were classified into an\nundefined physical exposure group with either low or high\npsychosocial exposure. The undefined group of workers had\nrelatively high levels of physical exposure compared with the\nlow physical exposure group but did not satisfy the criteria for\nhigh physical exposure. This group of workers was subject to\nthe greatest degree of self reporting bias and could not be\nclassified into a low or high physical exposure group as the\ntrue exposure classification was unclear. Self reported\nquestionnaires used for collecting physical exposure data have\nrestricted validity but are able to differentiate between low\nand high exposure groups.7 Therefore, this procedure was\nrequired to minimise self reporting bias that may result in\nexposure misclassification and underestimation of risk.8\nWorkers with only low and high physical exposures were used\nfor comparison and workers classified into the undefined\ngroup were excluded from the analyses of risk.\nThe age, sex, years spent in their current job, and outcome\ncharacteristics of those workers in the undefined and the\nexposure classified groups were compared to determine any\npotential bias from excluding workers in the risk analyses.\nThe exposure criteria were predetermined from an estab-\nlishedmodel 9 and also from epidemiological studies providing\na measure of risk for physical and psychosocial work factors.\nThe derivation of the exposure criteria and questionnaire\nitems used for exposure classification are described in detail\nelsewhere.6\nBoolean algebraic expressions for the high and low physical\nexposure criteria were used.\nBoolean algebraic expression for high physical exposure\ncriteria\nCriterion 1: lifting >16 kg > once\/hour.\nCriterion 2: lifting 6\u201315 kg >once\/hour and experiencing\nvibration while sitting >half the working day.\nAn individual worker was classified as having high physical\nexposure if at least one of the criteria (criterion 1 or 2) were\nsatisfied. Therefore, lifting greater than 16 kg more than or\nequal to once\/hour would classify a worker as high physical\nexposure. A worker would also be classified as having high\nphysical exposure if a 6\u201315 kg load was lifted more than or\nequal to once\/hour and, additionally, vibration while sitting\u2014\nfor example, driving\u2014was experienced for more than or equal\nto half the working day.\nBoolean algebraic expression for low physical exposure\ncriteria\nLifting 6\u201315 kg < once\/hour, and experiencing vibration while\nsitting <quarter of the working day, and lifting >16 kg not at\nall.\nTo be classified as having low physical exposure a worker\nhad to satisfy all three statements. It was thought that the\nhigh and low exposure criteria were appropriate for classifying\nworkers with exposure to risk factors for musculoskeletal dis-\norders of the neck and upper limb for the following reasons.\nThe effects of manual handling upon musculoskeletal\ndisorders of the neck and upper limbs were unclear and\nrequired further study.10 The few studies that have investi-\ngated lifting and musculoskeletal pain of the neck and upper\nlimbs have shown an increased risk.11 12 Work related\nmusculoskeletal disorders of the neck and upper limbs in gen-\neral have been associated with high force and high repetition,\nas well as vibration for some disorders.4 13 A review by Ari\u00ebns\net al14 reported that there was a positive relation between self\nreported neck pain and hand-arm vibration after the criteria\nfor inclusion of an article in the review were altered to include\nmore studies. The criteria for high physical exposure comprise\nlifting that requires high force application and repetition at\nthe hand due to lifting as well as the experience of whole body\nvibration. It is acknowledged that hand-arm vibration and\nwhole body vibration may present different internal loads and\nprimarily affect different body regions; however, whole body\nvibration was still considered a valid risk factor for musculo-\nskeletal disorders of the neck and upper limbs. A study of\noccupational drivers also showed a positive relation between\nback, shoulder, and neck pain indicating that possibly any dis-\norder may ensue if exposed to lifting and whole body\nvibration.15 An investigation of occupational salespeople who\ndrive showed that the 12 month prevalence of neck pain was\nassociated with annual driving distance, and the 12 month\nprevalence of shoulder pain was associated with the weekly\ntime spent in a car.16 However, lifting heavy loads was not\nassociated with back, neck, or shoulder pain in this study but\nthis was probably due to low exposure to this risk factor in\n95% of the salespeople. A review of the health effects of long\nterm occupational exposure to whole body vibration cites sev-\neral studies that have reported an increased frequency of sub-\njective complaints among drivers of pain in the neck and\nshoulders.17\nCriteria for psychosocial exposure was defined.\nHigh psychosocial exposure criteria\nHigh psychosocial exposure criteria were high mental\ndemands, low job control, and low social support. At least two\nof these criteria for high psychosocial exposure had to be sat-\nisfied to be classified in this group.\nLow psychosocial exposure criteria\nLow psychosocial exposure criteria were lowmental demands,\nhigh job control, and high social support. At least two of the\ncriteria for low psychosocial exposure had to be satisfied to be\nclassified in this group. These criteria were developed from the\nepidemiological literature on disorders of the neck, shoulder,\nupper limbs, and back.6\nDefinition of outcomes\nMusculoskeletal symptoms in the neck, shoulders, elbows,\nand hands or wrists were defined by aches, pain, or discomfort\nduring the 7 days preceding completion of the questionnaire.\nMusculoskeletal symptoms experienced in the upper limbs\n(shoulders, elbows, hands or wrists) irrespective of neck pain\nin the past 7 days were also used as an outcome measure.\nAssessing self reported symptoms is important as these\nmay lead to absence form work in the long term. This was\nshown in a 2 year follow up study in which workers that expe-\nrienced symptoms in the neck, shoulder, and upper limbs 2\n270 Devereux, Vlachonikolis, Buckle\nwww.occenvmed.com\n group.bmj.com on October 8, 2010 - Published by oem.bmj.comDownloaded from \nyears before follow up were two to four times more likely to be\noff work at follow up (assessed from company records) than\nworkers not experiencing symptoms.18\nStatistical analyses\nThe association between exposure and self reported symptoms\nin the neck, hands or wrists, and upper limbs was assessed by\nPearson\u2019s \u03c72 test for contingency tables. For a further assess-\nment, unconditional multiple logistic regression was used to\nestimate the odds ratios (ORs) for these symptoms for each\nexposure group. Age, sex, and cumulative exposure (years spent\nin the present job) were adjusted for in the logistic regression\nmodel. For each symptom, non-significant covariates remained\nin the model because of the theoretical plausibility of the\nvariables in determining the outcomes. An alternative logistical\nregression stepwise (backward unconditional) procedure was\nalso used to examine modification effects for men only. The\nmain models comprised age, years in the job, and three binary\nvariables representing the exposure factors (physical and\npsychosocial, with low physical and low psychosocial exposure\nas the reference category). The full models also included first\norder interactions between confounders (age and years spent in\nthe present job) and the exposure factors.\nVariables for the exposure terms were coded 0 for low expo-\nsure and 1 for high exposure. Indicator terms for age were\ncoded 0 for references (subject\u2019s age<40 years) and 1 for sub-\nject\u2019s age >40 years.\nTwo binary indicator variables were used for the cumulative\nexposure variable with three strata (<6 years, 6\u201315 years, and\n>15 years). Confidence intervals for themodel covariates were\ncalculated at the 95% level.\nAssessment of interactions\nEpidemiological interaction is present when the effect of one\nfactor increases the effect of another factor. Such an interaction\nwas investigated between physical and psychosocial workplace\nrisk factors and was analysed with an additive risk model.19 20\nThe rationale for using an additive risk model is discussed\nelsewhere.6 To investigate interactions between these two sets of\nfactors with logistical regression, participants who reported\nboth high physical exposure and high psychosocial exposure\nwere contrasted with participants who reported high exposure\nto only one of them. The odds of experiencing disorders in these\nexposure groups were divided by the odds in a group who were\nnot highly exposed to either set of factors to produce ORs. For a\npotential interaction to exist (R11\u2212R01)\u2212(R10\u2212R00)must be greater\nthan zero. The term R11 represents the measure of risk\n(prevalence ratio or OR in this case) from high exposure to\nphysical and psychosocial factors (the combined sets of factors),\nR10 represents the risk from exposure to high physical and low\npsychosocial factors (exposure to only the first set of factors),R01\nrepresents the risk from low physical and high psychosocial\nfactors (exposure to only the second set of factors), and R00 rep-\nresents the risk from exposure to low physical and low psycho-\nsocial factors (exposure to neither set of factors). The proportion\nof excess risk due to interaction was calculated from the results\nof the logistical regression analyses using indicator terms,\n(R11\u2212R01\u2212R10+1)\/R11 with corresponding 95% confidence inter-\nvals (95% CIs).21 A value greater than zero indicates a potential\ninteraction effect.\nRESULTS\nStudy population characteristics\nOf the 1514 workers invited to participate in the survey, 891\nworkers returned the questionnaire (59%). Twenty two\nrespondents returned uncompleted or insufficiently com-\npleted questionnaires giving a survey response of 57%. A\nhigher response rate was obtained for office workers (82%)\nthan manual handlers (49%),manual handling drivers (72%),\nand technicians (42%).\nOf the 869 responses, 720 had provided the exposure and\noutcome data for classification. Table 1 shows the distribution\nof the 720 subjects within each exposure group. One hundred\nand fifty six workers were classified between low and high\nphysical exposure in the undefined exposure group. These\nworkers did not differ from the workers included in the risk\nanalyses for age, years spent in the present job, or\nmusculoskeletal outcomes. There was a significant difference\nacross the two groups for sex (\u03c72=21.61, p<0.0001). About\n80% of workers in the risk analyses were men compared with\n96% in the undefined exposure group.\nSixty three per cent of workers in the undefined exposure\ngroup had high exposure to psychosocial risk factors.\nThe low physical and low psychosocial exposure group con-\ntained men who were older and had a greater number of years\nin the present job than did the other exposure groups (table\n2). Men and women were not evenly distributed throughout\nthe exposure groups. No women were classified in the high\nphysical exposure groups. Women were slightly younger\n(median) in the low physical and low psychosocial exposure\ngroup and there was no difference in the years spent in the\nTable 1 The number of subjects classified or\nunclassified into each exposure group\nPhysical exposure\nPsychosocial exposure\nTotalsLow High\nHigh 172 168 340\nLow 115 109 224\nSubtotal classified 287 277 564\nUnclassified 58 98 156\nTotals 345 375 720\nTable 2 Sex, age, and years spent in the present job across exposure groups\nExposure\nLow physical low\npsychosocial\nLow physical high\npsychosocial\nHigh physical low\npsychosocial\nHigh physical high\npsychosocial\nSubject (n):\nMen 60 50 172 168\nWoman 55 59 0 0\nAge (y, median category (quartile range)):\nMen 46\u201350 (36\u201355) 36\u201340 (26\u201345) 36\u201340 (31\u201350) 36\u201340 (31\u201350)\nWoman 31\u201335 (26\u201345) 36\u201340 (31\u201350) \u2013 \u2013\nDuration in job (y, mean (SD)):\nMen 9.6 (10.1) 6.0 (8.5) 6.5 (7.6) 6.9 (7.8)\nWoman 7.0 (9.0) 6.8 (9.1) \u2013 \u2013\nPhysical and psychosocial risk factors at work for neck and upper limb disorders 271\nwww.occenvmed.com\n group.bmj.com on October 8, 2010 - Published by oem.bmj.comDownloaded from \npresent job for women in the low physical and low psychoso-\ncial or the low physical and high psychosocial exposure\ngroups.Women and men performed sedentary office work but\nonly men performed manual handling and delivery driving.\nMusculoskeletal disorders of the neck and upper limbs\nTable 3 shows that about one third of the study population\nreported symptoms of musculoskeletal disorder in the neck,\nshoulders, and hands or wrists in the previous 7 days. About\n55% reported symptoms of musculoskeletal disorders of the\nupper limbs. The lowest prevalence was reported for elbow\ndisorders (17%).\nTable 3 also shows the number of subjects (and the\nprevalence proportion ratios) who experienced musculoskeletal\ndisorders for each exposure group. For the neck and shoulders,\nthe prevalence proportions for all four exposure groups were\nsimilar (\u03c72=4.071; df=3, p=0.254 for the neck and \u03c72=3.704;\ndf=3, p=0.295 for the shoulders). For the elbow and upper\nlimbs, the prevalence proportions of the high physical and low\npsychosocial or high physical and high psychosocial groups\nwere significantly higher than those of the other two exposure\ngroups (\u03c72=19.573; df=3, p<0.001 and \u03c72=21.492; df=3,\np<0.001); in particular the high physical and high psychosocial\nexposure group had the highest prevalence.\nModelling\nAnalyses were performed for the mixed male and female\npopulation and also for the data frommen only to compare the\nORs for each variable in the models.\nMixed sex population\nTable 4 shows the ORs from the model for symptoms of neck\ndisorders experienced in the past 7 days. None of the reported\nORs had 95% CIs greater than one.\nTable 5 shows the ORs from the model for hand or wrist\ndisorders in the previous 7 days for each exposure group com-\npared with low physical and low psychosocial exposure.

The highest value was found for symp-\ntoms in the upper limbs irrespective of neck pain.\nDISCUSSION\nNeck disorders\nA tentative increase in the OR for neck disorders was found for\nthe high physical and high psychosocial exposure group. A\nprevious cross sectional study investigated the combined\neffects of physical and psychosocial exposure for neck pain\ndefined as requiring medical attention in the previous year.12\nAlthough this study did not explore interaction effects it did\nshow that combined exposure to heavy lifting and poor\npsychosocial environment (work content, social support, and\nperceived workload) increased the risk of neck pain compared\nwith exposure to neither.\nIn our study, the prevalence proportion for neck disorders in\nthe 7 days before completion of the questionnaire was about\n36\/100 workers in the low physical and low psychosocial\nexposure group. This suggests that risk factors other than\nthose used in the exposure criteria and other background risks\nmay have been present and would account for the high preva-\nlence in the internal reference group. Therefore, the criteria\nused to classify subjects into exposure groups may not have\nbeen sufficiently sensitive to detect an increased risk of symp-\ntoms of neck disorders.\nAbout 88% of subjects were office workers in the low physi-\ncal and low psychosocial exposure group. Of the 869 workers\nin the study population about 95% of office workers used a\nkeyboard and 80% of office workers sat using a keyboard for\nmore than three quarters of the day. Most were in a customer\nservice centre and answered customer queries by telephone.\nThere were few opportunities to take breaks and change from\na seated working posture.\nAccording to some reviews there is strong evidence to sup-\nport static or maintained postures as a risk factor for\nmusculoskeletal disorders of the neck and shoulders.4 22 A\nrecent review also concluded that there was evidence for a\npositive relation between the duration of a fixed sedentary\nposture in the workplace and self reported neck pain,14 and\nseveral studies have shown an increased risk of neck disorders\nin office workers.23\u201326 Neck symptoms were found to be the\nmost often reported musculoskeletal problem for office work-\ners and risk factors for neck disorders included using a\ntelephone for 4\u20136 hours compared with 0\u20132 hours a day (OR\n1.4).27 Another study reported a percentage of 61.5% for neck\nor shoulder discomfort experienced in the past 12 months in\noffice computer workers and found an increased risk of neck\nor shoulder complaints due to limited opportunities for rest\nbreaks and static work postures.28 A high percentage of neck\npain in the past 7 days (about 30%) and in the past year (63%)\nfor office workers using computers or typewriters has also\nbeen shown.29 Working with this type of equipment for 5 hours\nor more increased the risk of neck pain (OR 1.65 95%CI 1.02\nto 2.67).\nTherefore in our study, it is likely that a seated static work\nposture and working with computers for more than three\nquarters of the working day resulted in symptoms of disorders\nof the neck in the internal reference population.\nUpper limb disorders\nWorkers highly exposed to both physical and psychosocial risk\nfactors at work had the highest likelihood of reporting symp-\ntoms of disorders in the upper limbs and specifically\nsymptoms of disorders of the hands or wrists compared with\nworkers in the other exposure groups. Findings that frequent\nlifting tasks (median 16\u201345 kg lifted more than 30 times\/\nhour) typically performed by workers in this exposure group\nidentified the application of high force exertion at the hand.30\nOther researchers have shown that handling tasks of this\nnature require about 30% of handgrip maximum voluntary\ncontraction.31 Lifting often occurs in combination with\nawkward and dynamic wrist postures and this may account\nfor the high number of reports of discomfort in the hands and\nwrists in workers performing lifting tasks.30 32\nOne epidemiological study of wrist disorders reported an\nincrease in risk when exposed to a combination of high force\nand high repetition that was greater than being exposed to\nforce or repetition alone (a multiplicative interaction was\nfound).33 This relation has also been found in an experimental\nstudy that replicated the exposure categories used in the epi-\ndemiological study.34 It was also concluded from the epidemio-\nlogical study that the force exerted was more important than\nrepetitiveness. Another cross sectional study supported this\nconclusion and added that the force exerted at the hand had a\nstrong influence on the velocity of movement, the angular\nrepetition at the hands or wrists, and the degree of movement\nin flexion and extension.35 Wrist motion, angular velocity, and\nacceleration have significantly differentiated low and high risk\ngroups with musculoskeletal disorders of the hands or\nwrists.36\nExposure to risk factors for the hands or wrists in tasks\nrequiring work at a visual display unit also involves the appli-\ncation of force in several postures as well as repetitive\nmovements of the hands or wrists.35 37 However, the levels of\nexposure particularly to the force exerted at the hand may be\nrelatively lower compared with frequent lifting tasks.38 39 This\nmay explain the differences in risk between those in the high\nphysically exposed groups and those in the low physically\nexposed groups.\nWorkers who reported low physical exposure and high psy-\nchosocial exposure were more likely to experience symptoms\nof disorders of the hands or wrists than those with low expo-\nsure to both sets of factors. Therefore, exposure to a combina-\ntion of psychosocial risk factors at work may significantly\ncontribute to the reporting of symptoms. Three studies\nconducted by the National Institute of Occupational Safety\nand Health (NIOSH) of the United States in office workers\nwho used computers have also shown an association between\npsychosocial work factors and musculoskeletal disorders of\nthe upper limbs.40 The association between psychosocial risk\nfactors at work such as job demands, decision latitude, and\nTable 7 Proportions due to interactions for neck,\nhand or wrist, and upper limb disorder symptoms in\nthe male only population\nMale only population\nProportion of\nexcess risk 95% CI\nNeck disorder symptoms 0.12 \u22120.65 to 0.90\nHand or wrist disorder symptoms 0.19 \u22120.19 to 0.57\nUpper limb disorder symptoms\nirrespective of neck pain\n0.26 \u22120.14 to 0.66\n274 Devereux, Vlachonikolis, Buckle\nwww.occenvmed.com\n group.bmj.com on October 8, 2010 - Published by oem.bmj.comDownloaded from \nsocial support and musculoskeletal symptoms in the upper\nlimbs has not been widely researched in office workers and\ncontradictory evidence exists.26 41 42 One study showed that\nthese psychosocial factors were not associated with symptoms\nof musculoskeletal disorders of the upper limbs, but organisa-\ntional and psychological factors were important, for example,\npossibility of job loss, overcrowding, and work stress.41\nInteractions\nPotential interactions between physical and psychosocial risk\nfactors at work were present as indicated by a departure from\nan additive model of risk. Male workers highly exposed to\nboth sets of physical and psychosocial risk factors at work\nexperienced the biological effects of background exposure,\nhigh physical exposure, high psychosocial exposure, and the\ninteraction effects of these two factors. Deviations from an\nadditive risk model should be used to measure interaction\nbetween determinants that are public health concerns.19 43 44\nTo our knowledge no other study has investigated the\npotential interaction effects between physical and psychoso-\ncial work factors on the risks of work related musculoskeletal\ndisorders of the neck and upper limbs. An explanation for the\ninteraction effects between physical and psychosocial risk fac-\ntors at work has been described in a previous paper by the\nsame authors.6 The contemporary evidence suggests that psy-\nchosocial work factors may be important determinants for\nsymptoms in the hands or wrists when exposure to physical\nrisk factors at work is low5 and this view is supported by the\nresults in this study. However, this study also showed that\npsychosocial work factors are important in the presence of\nhigh exposure to physical risk factors at work. The difference\nin the prevalence between the high physical and high psycho-\nsocial and the high physical and low psychosocial exposure\ngroups was greater than the difference between the low\nphysical and high psychosocial and the low physical and low\npsychosocial exposure groups for each region (table 3). It is\nplausible that psychosocial risk factors at work may influence\nexposure to tasks requiring heavy and frequent lifting as well\nas tasks involving computers. For example, performing lifting\ntasks or computer work under time pressure may increase the\nlifting rate and typing speed respectively and also the force\nexerted for these tasks. Hence, the biomechanical load on the\nupper limbs would be increased. Low job control over\nschedules for work and rest may influence recovery of the\nmusculoskeletal system. Poor social support from coworkers\nand managers may negatively influence work behaviour\nthrough frustration or anxiety that results in increased risk or\nit may affect the reporting of musculoskeletal symptoms.\nThese examples would explain the influence of high\npsychosocial exposure on the low and high physical exposure\ngroups. Psychosocial factors resulting in worker strain have\nbeen clearly associated with neck and upper limb complaints\nin tasks requiring high exposure and relatively low exposure\nto physical risk factors at work for upper limb disorders in a\nprevious study.45 Questionnaire data from a study in The\nNetherlands of 36 756 male employees and 7730 female\nemployees have shown that jobs with mentally and physically\ndemanding work are associated with greater musculoskeletal\ncomplaints in the neck and upper extremities than jobs\nrequiring only high mental demands.46\nResponse rates\nAlthough it seems that the participation rate varied between\nsedentary and manual handling and driving jobs, the percent-\nage responses are, nevertheless, large enough to allow valid\ncomparisons. The response rates achieved in this study are\ncomparable with those of other studies investigating similar\noccupational groups.23 29 32 47\u201349\nExposure criteria\nPredetermined exposure criteria were used for classification of\nindividual cases into low and high physical and psychosocial\nexposure groups. Combinations of long term whole body\nvibration and frequent lifting have produced the highest risks\nfor low back pain, neck pain, and shoulder pain compared\nwith the risks associated with individual factors.15 Combina-\ntions of high psychological demands, low decision latitude,\nand low social support may also result in the greatest risks\ncompared with individual factors.50 The use of these criteria\nwas appropriate for investigating musculoskeletal disorders of\nthe upper limbs, however, more specific exposure criteria may\nbe required for the neck.\nFor physical exposure in this study, 156 subjects did not sat-\nisfy the criteria for low or high physical exposure classifi-\ncation. The contrast between low and high physical exposure\nwas required to reduce the potential effects of misclassifica-\ntion of exposure.51 The exclusion of subjects did not affect the\noverall distribution of age, years on the job, and musculo-\nskeletal outcomes.\nResearch has shown that it is difficult for workers to accu-\nrately determine wrist postures, hand forces, and repetition\nrates.52 Therefore, it was considered more appropriate to use\nlifting rates and loads as surrogate measures of exposure to\nthese factors when classifying workers into low and high\nphysical exposure groups. Studies on occupational drivers\nhave shown that whole body vibration may be associated with\nneck and shoulder complaints.15 16 Therefore, it was reasonable\nto assess the duration of exposure of this factor by\nquestionnaire. Objective workplace measurement of factors\u2014\nsuch as working with arms above shoulder height, pushing\nand pulling, or exertion of static hand forces\u2014would have\nbeen required to enable classification of these aspects of\nphysical exposure. Although the omission of these variables in\nthe study is a possible weakness, the use of self report data for\nmeasuring these variables is known to be unreliable.53 54\nApplying this methodology requires a large study popula-\ntion to provide sufficient study power, especially for studying\ninteractions.55 Sufficient numbers were classified into each\nexposure group to detect a significant difference between\nexposure groups if such an effect existed while minimising the\neffect of a type I error.\nMeasures of risk\nThe OR was reported in this study and is an appropriate\nmeasure for estimating the likelihood of an association\nbetween exposure and outcome in cross sectional studies.56 57\nHowever, one disadvantage of the OR is that it becomes an\nincreasingly poor estimate of relative risk as the outcome\nprevalence increases.58 Thus, it should not be assumed that the\nORs reported in this study are an accurate measure of the\nrelative risk.\nValidity of exposure assessment\nThe self reported items of physical exposure used to classify\nsubjects into exposure groups had good validity when\ncompared with instrumentation and observational measure-\nments. The self reported psychosocial exposure items used to\nclassify subjects into exposure groups had acceptable sensitiv-\nity and specificity when compared with a questionnaire\nassisted interview.6\nThe cross sectional study design allowed the relation\nbetween exposure and disease to be examined for people at\nthe same time. Therefore with such a study design, it was not\npossible to determine whether the exposure was an anteced-\nent of the outcome.58 59 It has been hypothesised that the\nexperience of work relatedmusculoskeletal disorders may also\naffect physical or psychosocial exposure.60 For example, work-\ners with disorders may change to jobs (within the same\norganisation) with less exposure to physical or psychosocial\nrisk factors or may alter the way they perform their work task\nto reduce physical exposure. Similarly, perceptions of the way\nthe work is organised may increase psychosocial exposure.\nPhysical and psychosocial risk factors at work for neck and upper limb disorders 275\nwww.occenvmed.com\n group.bmj.com on October 8, 2010 - Published by oem.bmj.comDownloaded from \nAssuming the hypothesis is correct, the interactions found\nmay only exist after symptoms of a disorder have developed. A\nprospective study design is required to test this hypothesis.\nRisk may be underestimated or overestimated in epidemio-\nlogical studies where subjects rate both exposure and\noutcomes at the same point in time.58 For example, subjects\nwith pain may have high arousal levels or alertness to factors\nthey think influence their pain, therefore, they may overesti-\nmate the amount of exposure to these factors. However, one\nstudy concluded that there was no support for the hypothesis\nthat relative risk estimates were biased from rating behaviour\nwhere both exposure and outcomes were measured by\nsubjects.61 This conclusion is supported by other studies.6\nHealthy worker effects\nAnalysis of medical severance data for work related musculo-\nskeletal disorders showed that only a small proportion of\nworkers had left because of musculoskeletal disorders of the\nneck and upper limbs, therefore, there was a minimal healthy\nworker selection bias for this outcome in the total study popu-\nlation. These data could not be disclosed for reasons of confi-\ndentiality. Adjustment could not bemade for workers who had\nresigned or who had left their employment because of\nmusculoskeletal disorders of the neck and upper limbs but\nhad not received medical severance. The survivor population\ntended to be younger and have less years spent in the present\njob. Age has been shown to increase the risk of neck or shoul-\nder disorders in some studies.11 27 29 32 62 63 The number of years\nin the job has also been shown to increase the risk of shoulder\ndisorders.3 Therefore, the survivor population might be a\nhealthier population. Despite this, being over 40 years old\nincreased the risk of disorders of the neck and hands or wrists\nfor most of the outcome measures. Age was not a risk factor\nfor the upper limb disorder outcomes. Evidence from other\nstudies showing age as a risk factor for upper limb disorders\nhas not been consistent.3\nThe average measures for the number of years spent in the\npresent job and age were higher in the low physical and low\npsychosocial exposure reference group. This may have\nincreased the prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms in the\ninternal reference group, which would have reduced the ORs\nfor the other exposure groups. Workers could not move from\nheavy physical jobs to lighter physical jobs or vice versa in this\nstudy population so the risk estimates could not have been\nunderestimated for this reason.\nWomen were not present in the high physical exposure\ngroups because they did not performwork that required heavy\nand frequent lifting of the magnitude used for the high physi-\ncal exposure criteria. It is commonly thought that women are\nmore at risk of musculoskeletal disorders of the neck and\nupper limbs. However, there is evidence that the difference in\nrisk is due to the differences in exposure to risk factors in the\nworkplace rather than any constitutional factors.5 Including\nwomen in the low physical exposure groups did not bias the\nresults according to the comparison of the ORs between the\nmixed sex population and the men only population for the low\nphysical and high psychosocial exposure group. The OR for\nthis exposure group was smaller for the mixed population\nthan the men only population.\nThe age and sex distribution of the total study population\nhad a similar distribution to the survey response population.\nTherefore, a response bias due to age and sex differences\nbetween the response and non-response population was\nunlikely. Response bias due to outcome or years spent at the\njob could not be assessed.\nCONCLUSIONS\nExposure to physical workplace risk factors has been found to\nincrease the risk of symptoms of musculoskeletal disorders of\nthe hands or wrists but not the neck. Exposure to psychosocial\nworkplace risk factors may increase risk of symptoms of\nmusculoskeletal disorder of the hands or wrists even when\nthere is low exposure to physical workplace risk factors. This\nstudy suggests that the risk of experiencing symptoms of dis-\norders of the upper limbs is greatest when highly exposed to\nboth psychosocial and physical workplace risk factors.\nPhysical and psychosocial risk factors at work may\npotentially interact to further increase the risk of symptoms of\nmusculoskeletal disorders of the hands or wrists and upper\nlimbs. Strategies aimed at the prevention of these work related\nmusculoskeletal disorders should reduce exposure to physical\nand psychosocial workplace risk factors.\nProspective epidemiological studies concerned with work\nrelated musculoskeletal disorders are needed to confirm the\npresence of the interactions found here between physical and\npsychosocial workplace risk factors. More sensitive criteria for\nclassifying exposure may be required to identify the presence\nor absence of interactions with neck symptoms.\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nAuthors\u2019 affiliations\nJ J Devereux, P W Buckle, Robens Centre for Health Ergonomics,\nEuropean Institute of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Surrey,\nGuildford, Surrey GU2 7TE, UK\nI G Vlachonikolis, Medical Statistics Unit, European Institute of Health\nand Medical Sciences, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey GU2 7TE,\nUK\nREFERENCES\n1 Winkel J, Westgaard RH.
