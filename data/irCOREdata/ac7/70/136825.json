While the development of satellite\ntechnology is relatively slow in comparison to wireless networks\nevolution, due to the need for high reliability, the services that\nsatellites are able to offer are evolving at much the same pace\nas their terrestrial counterparts. It is within this context that the\nSatellite communications Network of Excellence (SatNEx) has\nevolved its initiative, the aim being to serve the engineering com-\nmunity with the latest technological trends, while also providing a\nsolid grounding in the fundamentals for those new to the subject\narea.\nI. INTRODUCTION: SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS,\nAN EVOLVING FIELD\nThe 21st Century citizen has a variety of different media in\nwhich to communicate for business and pleasure. As little as\na decade ago, the sophisticated mobile user was essentially\nlimited to low data rate mobile devices, as epitomised by\nthe European second-generation standard GSM. Today, the\naverage man on the street is faced with a wide variety of\nchoices, with third-generation services gradually being rolled-\nout and W-LAN technologies appearing in hot-spot venues.\nToday\u2019s digital revolution is not only driven by the terrestrial\ncommunity, satellites are now gradually starting to make their\nmark and develop niche services that could cross-over to mass\nmarket penetration.\nThe relentless growth in the telecommunications industry\nhas made a significant impact on the quality of life of users and\non the global economy. New ventures and services are opening\nup rewarding career opportunities for engineers with the appro-\npriate skills. For the European economic area to prosper, it is\nessential that its workforce be armed with suitable expertise.\nThe rapid evolution of today\u2019s technology means that there\nis now an ever-increasing demand for knowledge transfer and\ncontinued professional development (CPD), especially in areas\nthat are not traditionally associated with mainstream higher\neducation. Satellite communications represents a specialised,\npossibly niche, area of telecommunications engineering, which\nlends itself particularly to CPD. While the development of\nsatellite technology is slow in comparison to cellular, due to\nthe need for high reliability, the services that satellites are\nable to offer are evolving at much the same pace as their\nterrestrial counterparts. As a consequence, practicing engineers\nneed to be regularly trained in the new evolving technologies\nand applications. It is within this context that the Satellite\ncommunications Network of Excellence (SatNEx) has evolved\nits training initiatives, the aim being to serve the engineering\ncommunity with the latest technological trends, while also\nproviding a solid grounding in the fundamentals for those new\nto the subject area.\nII. PAN-EUROPEAN COLLABORATION IN SATELLITE\nCOMMUNICATIONS: AN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE\nAlthough SatNEx officially began its activities at the start of\n2004 with a two-year contract from the European Commission\n(EC) under the European sixth research framework programme\n(FP6) Information Society Technologies (IST) Thematic Area,\nthe history of collaborative research and training on a large,\npan-European scale between many of the SatNEx partners can\nbe traced back to the early nineties. In 1991, two new actions\nunder the European co-operation in the field of scientific\nand technical research (COST) programme, COST 226: Inte-\ngrated Space\/Terrestrial Networks and COST 227: Integrated\nSpace\/Terrestrial Mobile Networks, began to investigate the\nrequirements for integration between satellite and terrestrial\nnetworks from fixed and mobile perspectives. Subsequently,\nCOST 227 formed the basis for the Third Framework Pro-\ngramme RACE (Research and technology development in\n0-7803-8887-9\/05\/$20.00 (c)2005 IEEE\nAdvanced Communications technologies in Europe) II project\nSAINT: Satellite Integration in the Future Mobile Network, the\nfirst EC-funded project to investigate mobile satellite commu-\nnications integration with terrestrial networks. COST, now, as\nthen, is geared towards providing early-stage researchers with\nthe opportunity to network with their peers and to present their\npreliminary research in a less-formal, workshop type environ-\nment. Over the past decade, COST 226 and COST 227 sub-\nsequently evolved into COST 253: Service-Efficient Network\nInterconnection via Satellites and 252: Evolution of Satellite\nPersonal Communications from 2nd to Future Generation\nSystems, respectively, before finally merging into a single\nproject, COST 272, which is today investigating the delivery\nof packet-oriented services via satellite. Many of the initial\ncontributors to COST 226 and 227 serve on the Management\nCommittee of COST 272, which is shortly to conclude its four-\nyear programme, and participate in the activities of SatNEx.\nPan-European research into the air interface, and in partic-\nular the mitigation of propagation impairments, began in the\nearly nineties with COST 235: Radio Propagation Effects on\nNext-generation Fixed-Service Terrestrial Telecommunication\nSystems and the EC FP4-funded CRABS: Cellular Radio\nAccess for Broadband Sevices project regarding propagation\nimpairment mitigation techniques (PIMT) that could be imple-\nmented in next generation terrestrial fixed-service systems. In\n1996, an earth-space propagation dedicated action, COST 255:\nRadiowave Propagation Modelling for SatCom Services at\nKu-Band and Above, began to investigate the use of PIMT\nas a key concept for offering acceptable availability for new\nsatellite telecommunication systems operating at Ka-band and\nabove. A follow-on action, COST 280: Channel Modelling\nand Propagation Impairment Mitigation for Millimetre Wave\nRadio Systems aims to improve the design and planning of\npresent and future mm-wave broadband telecommunications\nsystems (including broadcast) and services (especially multi-\nmedia) through the development of knowledge and tools for a\nrefined evaluation of their performance. Several partners of the\nCOST 255 and 280 actions participate in SatNEx activities.\nSatellite communications research and development activ-\nities have been well supported by the EC, not just under\nthe COST programme but also under the funded research\nand development programmes, such as Advanced Communi-\ncations Technologies and Services (ACTS) and most recently,\nIST. Many of the partner organisations within SatNEx have\nbenefited from the research and training opportunities created\nthrough participation in projects such as SINUS, GEOCAST,\nSUITED and MODIS. Such projects tend to be led by industry\nand are limited in the number of organisations that are able\nto participate in a consortium. Although collectively, many\norganisations may be participating in such projects, the inter-\naction between them tends to be limited, chiefly through the\nEC\u2019s Concertation process, resulting in pockets of excellence\nacross Europe. The opportunity to address this fragmentation\nhas been tackled by the EC under FP6 through the new\ninstrument of networks of excellence (NoEs). While it is not\nintended to directly replace COST actions with NoEs, there\nare similarities in the objectives and way of working in many\nrespects, not least in the aim of training young researchers\nwithin the European research arena and extending knowledge.\nThe establishment of the SatNEx NoE represents a logical\nstep in the support for research and training in satellite com-\nmunications. SatNEx builds on the long-term collaboration\nbetween partner organisations, developed through COST, and\nthe expertise gained through the various Framework research\nand development programmes, such as ACTS and IST.\nIII. SATNEX: A LONG-TERM RESEARCH VISION\nA major aim of SatNEx is to rectify\nthe fragmentation in satellite communica-\ntions research by bringing together lead-\ning European academic research organ-\nisations in a durable way. The creation\nof the Network aims to establish critical\nmass and allow access to a range of\nexpertise currently distributed across Europe. In this respect,\nmobility is an important aspect of SatNEx\u2019s work, with aca-\ndemic staff and research students being encouraged to move\nbetween institutions to allow access to specialised research\nequipment and to facilitate research integration. SatNEx has\nan activity specifically dedicated to achieving this objective\n(WP 1400, see Figure 1). Of course, SatNEx is not just about\nmobility. A key goal of SatNEx is the establishment of a\ncommon communications platform that will exploit satellite\ncommunications technology to link all partners\u2019 sites. This\nplatform will provide SatNEx partners with a range of different\nopportunities for day-to-day communications, research and\ntraining. The ability to deliver interactive satellite communi-\ncations lectures over a satellite link is a feature of SatNEx\nthat is likely to be developed over the coming years. Already,\nseveral of the SatNEx partners from Italy and France have col-\nlaborated on this form of distance-learning and demonstrated\nits effectiveness under the COST 272 programme and it is\nexpected that this will extend to across the SatNEx community\nas the technology becomes widely available to members of the\nNetwork.\nEuropean research in satellite communications requires a\nlong-term vision from which to develop a technology and\nservice roadmap that will drive the longer-term research pro-\ngramme. SatNEx aims to produce this vision, in collaboration\nwith industry. The Wireless World Research Forum (WWRF)\nhas already produced such a detailed vision for mobile com-\nmunications. In developing the satellite vision, it is intended to\nwork closely with the Advanced Satellite Mobile Systems Task\nForce (ASMS-TF) for fixed broadband, mobile, broadcast and\nnavigation\/positioning areas.\nIV. THE CONSORTIUM: A PAN-EUROPEAN NETWORK\nThe SatNEx consortium is made up of twenty-two partners\nfrom nine European countries, as listed in Table I. The\nconsortium comprises a well-balanced mix of higher education\n(HE) institutions and research (RES) organisations, where two\nof the latter also have the small & medium enterprise (SME)\nTABLE I\nOVERVIEW OF THE SATNEX CONSORTIUM.\n1 DLR Deutsches Zentrum fu\u00a8r Luft- und Raumfahrt e.V.

Partners from industry are integrated into SatNEx via\nthe Advisory Board (see Figure 1). SatNEx is co-ordinated and\nmanaged by the Institute of Communications and Navigation\nof the German Aerospace Center (DLR).\nV. KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER AND TRAINING: KEY\nOBJECTIVES OF SATNEX\nSatNEx has been designed as a joint venture between\nresearch-led organisations and higher education institutions\nthat have as their mandate the production of new knowledge\nand the transfer of this knowledge to industry and to society\nat large. Within the SatNEx work programme, this is termed\n\u201cSpreading of Excellence\u201d, and encompasses activities dedi-\ncated to training, dissemination and standardisation. There are\nseveral avenues in which training of students, researchers and\nprofessional engineers are currently being explored, including:\n\u2022 the hosting of a satellite communications Summer School\nfrom 2005 onwards. The intention is to establish annual\nevents at locations within the Network, aimed at a global\ntarget audience;\n\u2022 the provision of dedicated short-courses that address spe-\ncific topics that are pertinent to the satellite community\nto facilitate CPD and promote lifelong learning activities;\n\u2022 the presentation of tutorial sessions at major satellite\ncommunications conferences;\n\u2022 the development of new ways of learning that take\nthe subject out of the classroom, in particular the ap-\nplication of distance-learning techniques and e-learning\ntechnologies. Subject matter will range in content from\nintroductory to advanced concepts. The use of satellite\ncommunication platforms and the Internet in support of\ndistance-learning applications is envisaged;\n\u2022 and the publication in an international journal of a se-\nries of tutorial papers and technical notes in areas that\nresearchers would find useful. SatNEx is able to provide\nopportunities for students originating from organisations\noutside of the Network to participate in its activities\nthrough project placement. This applies typically to Final\nYear Honours and Masters students that are required to\nperform a project as part of their degree programme.\nMembers of SatNEx typically host projects of 3-6 months\nduration and any projects that are available are advertised\non the SatNEx web site (http:\/\/www.satnex.org).\nVI.

This activity:\n\u2013 provides training opportunities for students and re-\nsearchers from organisations that are not members\nof the Network and for practicing engineers through\nCPD (WP 3100);\n\u2013 disseminates information and transfers knowledge\nthrough the generation of publications and support-\ning literature and media, including the webpage\n(WP 3200);\n\u2013 influences standardisation and regulation, and en-\nhances public awareness of the benefits of satellite\ncommunications (WP 3300).\nWP 4000 is the responsibility of the Network Coordinator,\nDLR, with input from the leaders of WPs 2000 and 3000.\nA mesh of integrating relationships, as illustrated in Fig-\nure 2, interconnects the activities and workpackages of the\nJPA. On top of the support from integrating activities (WP\n1000), there is a close relationship between the JER (WP\n2000) and the Spreading of Excellence (WP 3000): WP 2000\nproduces new knowledge and intellectual property, which\nprovides input for standardisation and regulation (WP 3300).\nOne of the activities of WP 2000 is to produce technical\nnotes and research-oriented tutorial papers, which feed into\nWP 3000 through the training and dissemination activities.\nIn the other direction, WP 3000 distributes information from\nWP 2100\nResearch Strategy\n \nr  tr t\nWP 2500\nResearch Trials\n \nr  ri l\n- provide input from standardisation\nand regulation\n- provide training opportunities\n- disseminate information and \ntransfer knowledge\n- exploit intellectual property\n- influence standardisation\nand regulation\n- enhance public awareness\n- co-ordinate participants\u2018 research\n- integrate tools and testbeds\n- provide communication platform\n- organise personnel exchange\n- perform knowledge management\n- develop tools and testbeds\n- propose personnel exchange\n- provide knowledge\n- provide communication platform\n- support knowledge exploitation\n- produce knowledge and\nintellectual property\n- produce input for standardisation\nand regulation\nFeedback\nFeedback\nWP 1000\nIntegrating\nActivities\n \nI t r ti\nti iti\nWP 3000\nSpreading\nof Excellence\n \nr i\nf ll\nWP 2000\nJointly\nExecuted Research\n \ni tl\nt r\nWP 2300\nNetworking\n \nt r i\nWP 2400\nAccess\n \nWP 2200\nSystem Studies\n \nt  t i\nFig. 2. Interdependencies between JPA Elements.\nstandardisation and regulation bodies to WP 2000. Moreover,\nWP 1000 supports the Spreading of Excellence (WP 3000)\nby providing the communication and collaboration platform.\nEfficient management and implementation of JER (WP 2000)\nis ensured due to strong relationships between the workpack-\nages in the WP 2000 activity: the research strategy and visions\n(WP 2100) drive the system studies (WP 2200), which in\nturn have influence on the research in networking (WP 2300)\nand access (WP 2400), as well as on the research trials\n(WP 2500). The research trials are not envisaged to begin until\nthe anticipated second phase of SatNEx from 2006 onwards.\nThe philosophy underlying the SatNEx approach is gov-\nerned by the selection of focused actions within the broad\nframework described by the overall JPA, in order to capitalise\non the expertise that is present within the Network and to\nensure that the integration is effective and durable. These\nfocused actions are performed jointly by the partners, and\nare identified as joint activitys (JAs). They include research,\nintegration, and dissemination activities. The research activity,\nin particular, focuses on knowledge gaps that may be present\nwithin the Network and on extending the knowledge already\nmade available at the start of the project by the SatNEx\nconsortium.\nThe JAs are the fundamental unit in the implementation of\nthe SatNEx JPA. A SatNEx JA is defined by a set of coherent\nactivities, cost elements and procedures that are required to\nachieve a specified objective within an associated time frame.\nA team of SatNEx partners, termed a Joint Activity Team,\njointly performs a JA. Each JA is focused on a relevant part\nof the JPA.\nThe WP structure (see Figure 1) is the organisational\nframework of SatNEx, setting out the scope of and also the\nresponsibilities within the project. Whereas, the JAs are the\nnew methods of putting the SatNEx objectives into practice -\nthey are the elements that specify how the work is performed.\nTable II provides a list of the current JAs performed by\nSatNEx.\nTABLE II\nCURRENT JOINT ACTIVITIES.\nJoint Activity Description\nJA-1000 Removing Barriers to Integration\nJA-1100 Collective Research Portfolio\nJA-1300 Networking Means for Integration and Dissemination\nJA-2100 Research Strategy and Visions\nJA-2230 High Altitude Platform Systems Architecture for Fixed and Mobile Communications\nJA-2300 Network Performance and Protocols\nJA-2330 Routing, Traffic Engineering and On-board Switching\nJA-2350 Network Security and Network Management\nJA-2410 Channel Modelling and Propagation Impairments Simulation\nJA-2420 Flexible Waveforms\nJA-2430 IP QoS and Radio Resource Management with Cross-Layer Approach\nJA-3200 Conferences on Satellite Communications\nVII. CONCLUSION\nThe SatNEx project has brought together twenty-two partner\norganisations from across the Europe Union with the aim of\nestablishing strategic leadership in the area of satellite com-\nmunications. This will be achieved through the performance of\na joint programme of activities, which include integrating ac-\ntivities, jointly executed research and spreading of excellence.\nTraining represents an important part of SatNEx\u2019s remit and is\nsupported through a number of initiatives including the hosting\nof internship projects, the establishment of summer schools\nand the dissemination of papers of a tutorial nature.
