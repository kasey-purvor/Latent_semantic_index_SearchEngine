INTRODUCTION \n \nThe magnetoelectric effect (ME) is characterized by the appearance of an electric \npolarization on applying a magnetic filed ( \u03b1=\u03b4P\/\u03b4H, called the MEH effect) or by the \nappearance of a magnetization on applying an electric field (\u03b1=\u03b4M\/\u03b4E, called MEE \neffect). It was originally predicted by Landau and Lifshitz from thermodynamics and \nsymmetry considerations1. This effect was first measured in a Cr2O3 crystal by a \ndynamic MEE method2 and then confirmed with a MEH method3,4. The ME effect in \nsingle phase materials is usually very small and often can only be detected at very low \ntemperatures, e.g., the ME coefficient \u03b1 for Cr2O3 is no more than 4.13x10-12 (s\/m) at \nroom temperature and the largest observed ME coefficient in single phase materials \nwas seen in TbPO4  (36.7 x10-12 (s\/m) ) below 2.2K5-6.  \n \nThe ME effect can also be achieved through product property7-8, where the magnetic-\nelectric coupling in some magnetostrictive-piezoelectric composites could be a few \norders larger7-17 than that in the single phase materials. Van Suchtelen proposed the \nproduct property concept, whereby entirely new properties could be achieved by \ncoupling a pair of tensor properties in two materials that were intimately mixed7. \nSince then two main materials processing routes have been investigated to achieve \nME effect this way, namely, (a) particulate magnetostrictive (MS) and piezoelectric \n(PE)  composites and (b) laminated MS\/PE composites. Investigations on eutectic co-\nexisting phases of spinel cobalt ferrite-cobalt titanate and perovskite barium titanate \nachieved  a magnetoelectric voltage coefficient \u03b1E (= \u03b1\/\u03b50\u03b5r) of ~ 50 mV\/cm Oe, \ndespite the theoretical estimation being 40-60 times larger8, here \u03b5r is the relative \n 3\npermittivity and \u03b50  the permittivity in vacuum.  Similar ME coefficients were \nobtained with particulate composites of the giant MS rare-earth-iron alloy Tb1-\nxDyxFe2 (TFD) and lead zirconate titanate (PZT) and PVDF polymer9. A recent \ninvestigation of CoFe2O4-BiFeO3 nanocomposites obtained values for \u03b1E as high as \n280 mV\/cm Oe10. On the other hand, laminated MS\/PE structures have been found to \nshow much higher MEH coefficients. Values for \u03b1E of 1500 mV\/cm Oe for ferrite-\nPZT11 and 4680 mV\/cm Oe for TFD\/PZT laminar structures12 have been reported. \nSignificant enhancement of the MEH response can be obtained when the modulation \nfrequency of the applied fields coincides with magnetic, electrical or mechanical \neigenmodes of the system under study13-15. Partly because it is easier to realise, the \npublished works on the ME effect as a product property in composite materials has so \nfar concentrated entirely on the MEH effect, namely, a magnetic field H as the input \nand an electric voltage as the output.  \n \nNowadays, electronic data is typically stored as regions of magnetic polarisation \nwithin ferromagnets and the magnetic polarisation can be reversed by magnetic fields. \nThe manipulation of magnetisation by means other than magnetic fields for example \nelectric fields could find applications in magnetic storage, spintronics18,  and other \nmagnetic sensing and actuating micro-electric-mechanical systems (MEMS) \ndevices15. Recently electrically controlled magnetic switches in the hole-induced \nferromagnetic semiconductor (In,Mn)As19 and in the magnetic ferroelectric compound \nHoMnO320  via magnetoelectric interaction, and the efficient coupling between \nferroelectric and magnetic order parameters in the self-organised nanocomposite \nBaTiO3-CoFe2O421 have been investigated.  \n \n 4\nRecently, we have investigated the MEE effect in laminated MS\/PE composites and \nobserved a large induced magnetization by applying an electric field to the \ncomposites22. This communication presents a theoretical calculation of the induced \nmagnetisation by the electric field for the laminated MS\/PE composites. For the low \nfrequency response of the MEH effect, Harshe23 et. al developed  theoretical models \nfor MS\/PE composites with 2-2 connectivity and obtained expressions for the \nlongitudinal MEH coefficients by assuming an ideal coupling at the MS and PE \ninterfaces. This model was improved to account for the non-perfect coupling at the \ninterfaces by Bichurin, Petrov and Srinivasan24-26. There is no published work on the \nmodelling of the MEE effect as a product property. In this paper, we will use the basic \nconstituent equations for the PE and MS materials to obtain modelling results for the  \nMEE coefficients for laminated MS\/PE composites and compare these figures with \nexperimental results in the literature. \n \nII. GENERAL THEORY \n \nWe consider a bilayer consisting of magnetostrictive (MS) and piezoelectric (PE) \nmaterials. For many cases, both the MS and PE materials are polycrystalline, and \ntherefore have the symmetry \u221em. Usually, the electric polarisation or the easy \nmagnetization direction (which is often the bias DC magnetic field direction as well) \nis assigned direction 3 in the Cartesian coordinate system so that the material property \nmatrix can be defined. This will make it much easier for material scientists to assign \nvalues from the general property matrix to their material property parameters. For this \npurpose a Cartesian coordinate system is applied to the MS or PE phase and 3 is \nalways the polarization or the easy magnetization direction. Table I summaries some \n 5\nsymmetry relations for non-zero coefficients of piezoelectric and piezomagnetic \nphases. Only the linear ME effect is considered, any bilinear or higher order effects \nare ignored. We also ignore the hysteresis effect of magnetization27. Perfect coupling \nbetween the MS and PE layers is assumed. \n \nWe assume that there is no bending of the structure. In practice, this can be achieved \nby configuring a symmetric sandwich structure such as MS\/PE\/MS or PE\/MS\/PE, \nwhere the total cross sectional area of the MS (PE) layer accounts for the area of the \nMS (PE) phase. \n \nFor piezoelectric materials, \njijj\np\niji\nkkij\npE\nij\np\ni\np\nETdD\nEdTsS\n\u03b5+=\n+=\n                                               (1) \nWhere pSi and pTj are the strain and stress tensor components of the PE phase, Ek and \nDi are the vector components of electric field and electric displacement, Eij\np s are \ncomponents of compliance at constant electric field of the PE phase, and dij and \u03b5ij are \ncomponents of piezoelectric coefficient and permittivity matrix respectively.

DISCUSSION \n \nFor single phase ME materials such as Cr2O3 and BiFeO3, the Gibbs free energy of \nthe material contains a coupled electric magnetic term \u2013\u03b1ijEiHj, so from \nthermodynamics it can be obtained that the MEE coefficient equals the MEH \ncoefficients6. However, this is not the case for composite materials where ME effect is \na product property. For a MS\/PE composite, the free energy of the system is the sum \nof the free energy of the MS and PE materials, where there is no apparent coupling \nbetween the electric and magnetic field. Their indirect coupling is through the \ncoupling of the stress and strain at the interface of the two materials. For a loss free \nsystem with perfect strain coupling between the MS and PE materials, it is still \n 9\npossible that the MEE coefficient equals the MEH coefficients under certain conditions \nbut this is not as straightforward as for the single phase ME materials. \n \nDefining the magnetoelectric Oersted coefficient as \u03b1H,ij=\u03b1ij\/\u03bc0\u03bcr=Hi\/Ej where \u03bc0 is the \npermeability in vacuum and \u03bcr is the relative permeability of air, then \u03b1H,ij has the unit \nOe cm\/V and Hi is equal to the measured magnetic field immediately outside the MS \nmaterial along the i direction. However, if the cross sectional area mA3 of the sample is \nsmaller than the area of the detector, or the induced magnetization is detected by a \npickup coil around the sample, the measured response is proportional to the total \ninduced flux, e.g.,  B3 mA3. The dependence of \u03b1H,ij as a function of the ratio of the \ncross sectional areas (or of the thickness ratio if the widths are the same for the PE \nand MS layers) can be calculated using the above results.  \nEquations (5), (6) and (7) indicate that, generally speaking, the induced magnetization \nis three dimensional. However, for MS materials with strong anisotropy, i.e., q33>> \nq11, and q33>> q22 , the main magnetization occurs along the direction 3. \n \nAt the conditions \n1\n1\n2\n2\nA\nA\nA\nA\np\nm\np\nm\n=  for the case (i),  \n)(\n2\n11121112\n3131\n33\nvsvsss\nvqd\nmEpmEpHmHm\np\nE\n+++=\u03b1 ,  \nthis compares to Harshe\u2019s expression for the MEH effect \n \nvskvssvss\nvqd\nvdvssvss\nvqd\nmEpmEpEppHmHm\nm\npmmEpEppHmHm\nm\nH\n11\n2\n3112111211\n3131\n33\n2\n3112111211\n3131\n33\n)(2)()(\n2\n\/)(2)()(\n2\n\u2212+++\n\u2212=\n\u2212+++\n\u2212= \u03b5\u03b1\n \n 10\nwhere k31 is the coupling coefficient for the piezoelectric phase. It can be seen that \nboth the MEE coefficient and the MEH coefficients are proportional to 3131qd  , the \nproduct of piezoelectric and piezomagnetic coefficients, but they are not equal to each \nother at all conditions, as is the case for single phase ME materials. \n \nFor numerical calculations, we assume \n1\n1\n2\n2\nA\nA\nA\nA\np\nm\np\nm\n= for the case (i) and \n1\n1\n3\n3\nA\nA\nA\nA\np\nm\np\nm\n=  \nfor (iii), and \n2\n1\n1\n3\nA\nA\nA\nA\np\nm\np\nm\n= for case (ii).  If the PE material is PZT and the MS material \nis TFD, for the material parameters given in Table II, Fig. 2a shows the ME \ncoefficient \u03b133 as a function of volume fraction mv=mA\/( mA+ pA) assuming the widths \nare the same for the MS and PE layers. The total induced flux per unit electric field \n\u03b133 mv = B3 mv3\/E3 as a function of  mv is shown in Fig. 2b. It can be seen that the in-\nplane configuration has the highest magnetoelectric response, and the transverse \norientation has the lowest among the three cases discussed. \n \nWe reported22 preliminary measurement results of the magnetoelectric Oersted \ncoefficient \u03b1H,33=15.4 Oe\/(28KV\/m)=55 Oe cm\/KV and  ME coefficient = M\/E  = 5.7 \nx10-8 (s\/m) for the tri-layer laminated composites of TFD\/PZT\/TFD and \nPZT\/TFD\/PZT at the fundamental mechanical resonant frequency. The samples were \nconfigured as in case (ii). Using the above formula, the calculated  \u03b133= 8.3 x 10-8 \n(s\/m), and  \u03b1H,33=\u03b133\/\u03bc0\u03bcr=6.6 x 10-2 (A\/m\/V\/m) = 80 Oe cm\/KV. Both the theoretical \nand experimental values are more than 4 orders of magnitude greater than the value \nfor the single phase material Cr2O3. Although the experimental value agrees well with \nthe calculated one, strictly speaking this theory is not applicable at resonant frequency \nand therefore they are not comparable. The ME response at resonant frequency could \n 11\nbe a few times larger than the non-resonant frequency response. However this \ndiscrepancy between theory and experiment for ME response as a product property is \nnot unusual8, 11, 23, 30. The main reason is believed to be the assumption of perfect \ncoupling at the interface in the theory, which is probably not true in practice.  \n \nThe ME effect as a product property in multilayer PE\/MS thin films is a promising \nresearch subject15. However the giant MS material TFD may not be the most suitable \nmaterial for this application for reasons such as the applicable production method, \nmaterial porosity and brittleness.  Magnetostrictive oxides such as Ni and Co ferrite \nare often the chosen MS materials in these situations. We have also estimated the \nMEE coefficient for the PZT\/CoFe2O4 bilayer composite (material properties are \nsummarised in Table II). This composite can be prepared in the form of thin films by \nthe sol-gel method. Fig. 3a shows the MEE coefficient \u03b133 as a function of volume \nfraction mv=mA\/( mA+ pA) if the widths are the same for the MS and PE layers. The \ntotal induced flux per unit electric field \u03b133 mv = B3 mv3\/E3 as a function of  mv is  \nshown in Fig. 3b. It can be seen that there is little difference between the in-plane and \ntransverse configurations for the ME response, and the longitudinal orientation has the \nlowest response among the three boundary conditions. Notice also, the magnitude of \nthe ME response is about 1\/10th that of the TFD\/PZT composite. \n \n \nV. CONCLUSIONS \n \nTheoretical modelling of the MEE magnetoelectric effect for 2-2 connectivity \ncomposites has been developed for three different boundary conditions by assuming \n 12\nperfect coupling at the interface. The calculated ME coefficients using the material \nproperties of PZT and Terfenol-D are a few orders larger than those of any single \nphase ME materials. \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n \nThis work was financially supported by the UK EPSRC under Platform Grants \nGR\/R92448 (Thin film ferroelectrics for nanotechnology applications) and \nEP\/D506638\/1 (Nanoscale Multifunctional Ferroic Materials and Devices) and \nEP\/C519426\/1 (Magnetoelectric Materials and Devices).
