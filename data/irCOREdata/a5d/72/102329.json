INTRODUCTION\nFollowing the success of III-V quantum cascade lasers\n\u0001QCLs\u0002 at both mid-infrared1 and far-infrared \u0001terahertz\u0002\nfrequencies,2,3 there is considerable interest in the develop-\nment of silicon-based quantum cascade devices for low-cost\nsources and optoelectronic integration with other circuitry.\nThe indirect band gap that has hindered interband emitter\ndevelopment in Si, Si1\u2212xGex, and Ge does not affect QCLs,\nas they rely on carrier transitions within the same \u0001conduc-\ntion or valence\u0002 band rather than on exciton recombination\nacross the band gap. Indeed, SiGe-based materials have a\nmajor advantage over III-V\u2019s for this type of device, in that\nphonons are nonpolar,4 and this reduces the principal nonra-\ndiative scattering rate that limits the efficiency in III-V\ndevices.2 This is particularly true at photon energies below\nthe optical phonon energy \u0001\u0004\u0005\u0006\u0004\u0005opt\u0002 which range is the\nsubject of the present work.\nIf a QCL could be realized in Si\/SiGe, the lack of polar\noptical phonon scattering, the lower free carrier absorption,\nand the higher thermal conductivity of Si could allow signifi-\ncantly higher operating temperatures in the terahertz \u0001THz\u0002\nrange. Moreover, there could be lower manufacturing costs\ninvolved with the mature silicon process technology. We\nhave previously demonstrated the first electroluminescence\nfrom p-Si\/SiGe quantum cascade emitters at THz\nfrequencies,5 however, no significant optical gain or stimu-\nlated emission has been achieved so far in Si\/SiGe QC struc-\ntures. In order to achieve a silicon-based QCL, a structure\nthat can achieve population inversion and high gain has to be\ndesigned. Of paramount importance to this end is the ability\nto engineer carrier lifetimes.\nThe intersubband lifetimes of both inter- and intrawell\ntransitions can be tailored by carefully designing the thick-\nness and the composition of the different layers that form the\nQC structure. A tunability with barrier width has been dem-\nonstrated previously at energies above \u0004\u0005opt, where lifetimes\nvarying between 20 and 35 ps were deduced from electrolu-\nminescence measurements for diagonal transitions in QC\nstructures of p-Si\/SiGe.6 However, the transport properties\nin semiconductor quantum wells have also been shown7\u201312 to\nbe strongly influenced by the quality of the interfaces. Fluc-\ntuations in the well width due to the presence of nonideal\nsurfaces result in local fluctuations of the carriers\u2019 confine-\nment potential, which act as a scattering potential for the\ntwo-dimensional \u00012D\u0002 carrier gas. A very recent detailed ex-\nperimental and theoretical study on n-GaAs\/AlxGa1\u2212xAs\nmid-infrared QCLs found13 that interface roughness \u0001IFR\u0002\nscattering is the most efficient elastic relaxation mechanism\nat low temperature in those systems and becomes dominant\nwhenever LO-phonon emission is inhibited. Its inclusion in\nthe theoretical calculations was shown to be crucial to repro-\nduce the observed magnetic field dependence of the emitted\npower. In SiGe systems, previous theoretical9 and\nexperimental11 studies have found that IFR scattering is a\nmajor limiting factor for the low-temperature mobility of 2D\nhole gases in quantum wells \u0001QWs\u0002 narrower than about\n5 nm.\nHere we present the results of a theoretical and experi-\nmental investigation into the effects of IFR scattering on the\nPHYSICAL REVIEW B 75, 045338 \u00012007\u0002\n1098-0121\/2007\/75\u00014\u0002\/045338\u00016\u0002 \u00a92007 The American Physical Society045338-1\nlifetime of diagonal \u0001i.e., interwell\u0002 intersubband transitions\nbetween heavy-hole \u0001HH\u0002 ground states in two different p\n-SiGe coupled asymmetric quantum wells \u0001CAQWs\u0002 in this\nsize range. The experimental information is provided by\ntime-resolved measurements with a far-infrared pulsed free-\nelectron laser. Such a device is the only laser source that has\na short enough pulse duration and high enough intensity to\npump and probe the fast recovery transition in this wave-\nlength range. It also provides wide wavelength coverage for\nHH-HH and HH\u2013light hole \u0001LH\u0002 transitions, and continuous\ntunability for resonant excitation.4 In contrast, the previously\nreported data on decay times in p-Si\/SiGe QC structures6\nwere obtained indirectly from electroluminescence measure-\nments. The extraction of subband lifetimes in that case was\ntherefore based on a number of assumptions which may have\nlimited the accuracy of the deduced values. Here, by using a\npump-probe technique, we measure directly the decay time\nfrom the upper HH1 ground state to the lower HH1 ground\nstate in the adjacent quantum well. Furthermore, unlike in\nRef. 6, in the present case the structures are specifically de-\nsigned so that between these two levels there is no other state\nthat could provide alternative relaxation pathways, allowing\nan unambiguous determination of the upper-state lifetime.\nWe show that we can achieve very long lifetimes \u0001\u000370 ps\u0002,\nwhich exhibit a relative insensitivity to the temperature com-\npared to GaAs devices.2\nWe calculate IFR scattering rates, compare them with the\nrates of other mechanisms, such as scattering due to alloy\ndisorder and acoustic and optical phonons as well as carrier-\ncarrier interaction \u0001all calculated within a time-domain rate\nequation scheme4\u0002 and predict that, despite the good quality\nof our interfaces \u0001with an average roughness step height of\nonly 1.2\u20131.5 \u00c5\u0002, IFR will constitute more than 50% of the\ntotal scattering rate up to \u0003100 K, remaining stronger than\nany of the other scattering processes up to about 200 K. We\nshow that in this regime both barrier and well widths need to\nbe carefully designed in order to achieve the desired inter-\nsubband transition rates. Our theoretical results are in very\ngood agreement with our measured lifetimes in the tempera-\nture range experimentally investigated.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nWe have investigated two strain-symmetrized Si\/SiGe\nCAQW structures on \u0001001\u0002 Si, utilizing pump-probe spec-\ntroscopy of HH interwell transitions to measure the nonradi-\native recombination by diagonal \u0001bound to bound\u0002 HH1-HH1\ntransitions through the Si barrier. The structures considered\nin the present study \u0001BF1499 and BF1500\u0002 consist of 20\nperiods each containing CAQWs grown on a relaxed buffer\nof Si0.8Ge0.2. The first \u0001BF1499\u0002 has 3.4 and 4.6 nm undoped\nSiGe wells with a nominal Ge content of 40%, separated by\na Si barrier of 1.8 nm. The second wafer \u0001BF1500\u0002 has 3.2\nand 4.15 nm undoped SiGe wells with a nominal Ge content\nof 40%, separated by a 2.3 nm Si barrier. The pairs of\nCAQWs are separated by a 5 nm Si barrier, the central\n3.2 nm of which is modulation doped with B to a concentra-\ntion of NA=1.6\u00071018 cm\u22123. The layer thicknesses have been\nmeasured by transmission electron microscopy \u0001TEM\u0002 using\nhigh-angle angular dark field \u0001HAADF\u0002 imaging \u0001see Fig. 1\u0002,\nwhile the as-grown Ge contents \u0001slightly lower than the\nnominal ones\u0002 were obtained using z-contrast HAADF, cali-\nbrated with energy-dispersive x-ray analysis of the thick\nSiGe buffer layer. The parameters thus obtained were used to\ncalculate the hole subband structure using our fully aniso-\ntropic 6\u00076 k \u00b7p method,14 which in both cases yielded an\ninterwell transition energy of \u000320 meV between the two\nlowermost HH states in the two wells, in good agreement\nwith the measured wavelengths for the maximum pump-\nprobe signal \u000162.5 \bm, \u000319.8 meV for BF1499 and\n60.1 \bm, \u000320.6 meV for BF1500\u0002. The calculated subband\nstructure of the as-grown CAQWs in sample BF1499 is pre-\nsented in Fig. 2, where the diagonal nonradiative transition\nacross the i-Si barrier layer is indicated by a red arrow. The\nslightly different depths of the two wells shown in Fig. 2\nreproduce the slight difference in Ge content between them\nfound in our HAADF measurements in all periods imaged.\nThe lifetimes were measured using the Dutch Free Electron\nLaser for Infrared eXperiments \u0001FELIX\u0002, in the Netherlands.\nThe FELIX delivers macropulses with a length of 7 \bs at a\nrepetition rate of 5 Hz. Each macropulse consists of a train\nof micropulses of duration \u000310 ps and 25 MHz repetition\nrate. A pump-probe technique \u0001or transient bleaching tech-\nnique\u0002 in which the FELIX beam is split into pump, probe,\nand reference beams was used.15 The samples were mounted\nin vacuum on the cold finger of a liquid helium continuous-\nflow cryostat, with temperature variable from 4.2 to 300 K.\nIn order to access the HH-HH transitions it was necessary to\npump and probe at oblique incidence, enabling the polariza-\ntion selection rule E parallel to the growth direction. The\nexperiments have been performed with the wavelength of\nFELIX tuned to the absorption peak of the subband transition\nat 61.3 \bm. Figure 3 shows the transient bleaching signal for\nsample BF1499 as a function of time delay between probe\nand pump measured for different values of the FELIX pump\npower at 10 K \u0001a\u0002, and for different temperatures \u0001b\u0002.\nIII.

In this limit the matrix elements depend\nonly on the product \t\n. This is, however, not the case with\nour samples and, for a given value of the product \t\n= p0 \u00c52,\nwe have found large differences between the lifetimes calcu-\nlated with \r\t=1 \u00c5, \n= p0 \u00c5\u000e and \r\t=4 \u00c5, \n= p0 \/4 \u00c5\u000e,\nwhich increased with decreasing carrier temperature.\nCalculation of the scattering rates is more involved in the\nvalence than in the conduction band, due to the complicated\nnature of the band structure. The expression for the IFR scat-\ntering matrix element Eq. \u00012\u0002 used here, for example, is simi-\nlar to that used by Unuma et al. for the case of electrons;10\nhowever, in the present work the quantity Fmn had to be\nmodified to allow each of the wave function components to\nexperience a different potential at the interface, according to\nits \u0001heavy-hole, light-hole, or split-off\u0002 character. The transi-\ntion rates due to optical and acoustic phonon, alloy disorder,\nand hole-hole scattering were calculated as described\npreviously.14,16 The total scattering rates due to all the decay\nmechanisms were then employed in a multisubband rate\nequation model14,16 to track the time evolution of hole popu-\nlation over subbands, following the initial excitation.\nIV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nDue to the lack of detailed experimental information on\nthe quality of our samples interfaces, we resorted to the\nstandard8,12,17 procedure of treating \t and \n as fitting param-\neters. We deduced their values from the temperature depen-\ndence of the decay time in one structure \u0001BF1499\u0002 and then\nused them in the calculation of the lifetimes of the other\nstructure \u0001BF1500\u0002, obtaining very good agreement with our\nFIG. 2. \u0001Color online\u0002 Calculated subband structure of BF1499\nshowing the energy levels and the square of the wave functions of\nthe first eight hole states \u0001we use an electronlike picture where the\nenergy scale is reversed: the ground state is the lowermost\u0002. The\nslightly different depths of the two wells shown reproduce the slight\ndifference in Ge content between them found in our HAADF mea-\nsurements in all periods imaged. The interwell nonradiative transi-\ntion between level 2 \u0001red\u0002 and level 1 \u0001blue\u0002 is indicated by a red\narrow.\nFIG. 3. \u0001Color online\u0002 Power \u0001a\u0002 and temperature \u0001b\u0002 depen-\ndence of the interwell transition lifetimes, measured at T=4 K for\nBF1499.

Our best fits are obtained\nwith \t=1.2\u20131.5 \u00c5 and \n=40\u201360 \u00c5 suggesting good-\nquality interfaces. These IFR parameters are also within the\nrange of values reported in the literature9,11,12,18 \u0001\t=1\u20134 \u00c5,\n\n=23\u2013300 \u00c5, \t\n=60\u20131200 \u00c52\u0002 for Si\/SiGe interfaces\nwith various Ge content. Interestingly, the value \t=1.5 \u00c5\nwas also assumed by Leuliet et al. in their study of\nGaAs\/AlxGa1\u2212xAs QCLs,13 to obtain the best agreement be-\ntween theoretical and experimental total scattering rates. In\nall our calculations we also assume the carrier temperature\nTh at detection time to be related to the lattice temperature\nTlatt according to Th=Tlatt+\u000bT, where \u000bT is a constant \u0001i.e.,\nTlatt-independent\u0002 quantity representing the residual effects\nof the carrier heating produced by the laser pulse. We used\n\u000bT as an additional fitting parameter and found that the\nchoice \u000bT=0\u201320 K gives the best fit to experiment. This\nassumption is not unreasonable, as the hole intrasubband\nthermalization occurs on a subpicosecond time scale whereas\nthe experimental time resolution is in the picosecond range,\nallowing access to carriers already relaxed to \u0001or near\u0002 the\nbottom of the subband. A further confirmation of this fast\ndynamics is provided by the almost power-independent be-\nhavior shown by our measured subband lifetimes over a\nrange of attenuation of 30 dB \rsee Fig. 3\u0001a\u0002\u000e, indicating a\nvery fast intrasubband carrier thermalization time, experi-\nmentally inaccessible by our present setup. In contrast the\nsame lifetimes display a clear dependence on the lattice tem-\nperature \rsee Fig. 3\u0001b\u0002\u000e confirming that we are probing ther-\nmalized carriers. However our samples exhibit a slower\nvariation with temperature compared to equivalent GaAs-\nbased systems,2 where polar optical phonon scattering domi-\nnates.\nFigure 5 shows both absolute \u0001a\u0002 and relative \u0001b\u0002 IFR\nscattering rates as a function of \t and \n calculated for\nBF1499 at a lattice temperature of 20 K \u0001similar results are\nobtained for BF1500\u0002. For a fixed value of \t, the IFR rates\nincrease initially as \n2, reach a maximum around \n=50 \u00c5,\nand then decrease as exp\u0001\u2212q2\n2 \/4\u0002. The dependence on \t is\ninstead quadratic for all values \rsee Eq. \u00013\u0002\u000e. The total scat-\ntering rates have a similar magnitude, indicating that IFR is\nthe dominant scattering mechanism in these structures at low\ntemperature. This is confirmed by the results presented in\nFig. 6, showing the \rabsolute \u0001a\u0002, and percentile \u0001b\u0002\u000e contri-\nbutions to the total scattering rates coming from the different\nscattering mechanisms, acoustic and optical \u0001op1=Ge-Ge,\nop2=Si-Si, and op3=Si-Ge branches\u0002 phonons, alloy disor-\nder \u0001i.e., composition fluctuations\u0002, IFR, and hole-hole inter-\naction, calculated as a function of the lattice temperature Tlatt\nfor \t=1.2 \u00c5, \n=60 \u00c5, and \u000bT=20 K. In the absence of\nIFR, the main scattering mechanisms at low temperature are\n\u0001in order of decreasing importance\u0002: carrier-carrier, alloy dis-\norder, acoustic phonons, and optical phonons \u0001Ge-Ge, Si-Ge,\nand Si-Si respectively\u0002. While carrier-carrier and phonon\nscattering increase with temperature as expected \u0001the latter\nmuch faster than the former\u0002, the scattering rate due to alloy\ndisorder shows a slight temperature dependence owing to the\ntemperature dependence of the hole distribution.\nFrom Fig. 6\u0001a\u0002 we see that when Tlatt increases other\nmechanisms, namely, acoustic and optical phonon \u0001first the\nGe-Ge and then the Si-Ge branches\u0002 and hole-hole scatter-\ning, become important. For Tlatt\r100\u2013150 K they are com-\nparable in magnitude to IFR, and for Tlatt\r230 K both\nacoustic and Ge-Ge optical phonon scattering rates become\nlarger than IFR rates. However from Fig. 6\u0001b\u0002 we see that\nFIG. 4. \u0001Color online\u0002 Comparison of experimentally measured\n\u0001symbols\u0002 and theoretically predicted \u0001lines\u0002 interwell transition\nlifetimes as a function of lattice temperature Tlatt for our two\nsamples BF1499 \u0001red\u0002 and BF1500 \u0001blue\u0002.

PHYSICAL REVIEW B 75, 045338 \u00012007\u0002\n045338-4\nalready for Tlatt\r70 K the IFR contribution becomes less\nthan 50% of the total scattering rate, indicating that, although\nstill comparatively large, IFR is no longer the dominant fac-\ntor influencing the subband carrier lifetimes in this tempera-\nture range. As shown in Fig. 7, at room temperature, the\ncontribution of IFR to the total scattering rate reaches 50%\nfor \t=2.5, but it is only for \t\r3.5 that such contribution is\nabove 50% for all values of 20\u000e\n\u000e180. IFR rates are,\nhowever, already larger than those of any other mechanism\nfor \t\u00011.75. In contrast, we find that at low temperature\n\u0001=20 K\u0002 it is only when \t drops below 0.6 \u00c5 \u0001i.e., for a very\ngood quality interface\u0002 that hole-hole, alloy, and acoustic\nphonon scattering become stronger, for most values of \n.\nHaving proved the importance of IFR at low temperature,\nwe now need to go back to Fig. 4 and discuss an apparent\ninconsistency. Although the CAQWs in BF1499 and BF1500\nhave different layer thicknesses, we see that their measured\nlifetimes are the same within experimental error. This is\ncounterintuitive as, in a regime where scattering is domi-\nnated by IFR, one would expect the transition rates to in-\ncrease with decreasing barrier width, as IFR rates are propor-\ntional to the value of the wave functions at the interface\n\u0001closely related to their penetration into the barrier\u0002 which is\nlarger for thinner barriers. The observed behavior can, how-\never, be explained by noting that the structure with the thin-\nnest barrier \u0001BF1499\u0002 also has the widest wells. The confine-\nment of the wave functions is therefore reduced in BF1499\ncompared to BF1500, which would result in a reduced value\nat the interface if the barrier dimensions were the same. In\nthis case the lifetime would be longer, as shown by the\ndashed line in Fig. 4, obtained for a hypothetical structure\nwith the wells of BF1499 and the barrier of BF1500. In the\ncase of BF1499, however, the narrower barrier allows a\nlarger penetration and the value of the wave function at the\ninterface becomes similar in both samples. This effect is well\nreflected by our calculated lifetimes, showing that both bar-\nriers and wells need to be carefully engineered in order to\ntailor the intersubband lifetimes to the desired values. The\neffect on the lifetime of increasing the barrier width is ob-\ntained from a comparison of the dashed and the red lines in\nFig. 4, whereas comparing the dashed and the blue lines\nshows the effect of widening the wells. We see that an in-\ncrease of 0.5 nm in the barrier width is more effective in\nreducing the transition rate than the same increase in the\nwidth of one of the wells \u0001and a 0.2 nm increase in the\nother\u0002.\nFurther evidence that the inclusion of IFR scattering is\ncrucial to explain the intersubband decay dynamics in SiGe\nheterostructures is provided by the results presented in the\ninset of Fig. 4, where the lifetimes for BF1500 and BF1499\ncalculated for perfect interfaces \u0001i.e., in the absence of IFR\u0002\nare plotted as a function of lattice temperature and compared\nwith our measured data \u0001the same as in the main panel\u0002.

Point \u0001ii\u0002 here is the most meaningful, as it\nclearly shows that, apart from its evident quantitative dis-\nagreement with our measurements, the observed behavior of\nthe lifetimes as a function of temperature cannot even quali-\ntatively be described without taking into account the effects\nof IFR scattering. This feature excludes any possibility of\nattributing \u0001i\u0002 to inaccuracies in our scattering calculations\nand suggests that the dominant role of IFR scattering in in-\ntersubband transitions, shown here for energies below the\noptical phonon energy in multiple quantum well systems and\nalready found in mid-infrared GaAs\/AlxGa1\u2212xAs QCLs,13 is\na general property of a wide range of semiconductor hetero-\nstructures ranging from III-V to IV-IV materials.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nIn summary, we presented a theoretical and experimental\nstudy of the nonradiative lifetime of interwell transitions be-\ntween heavy-hole subbands spaced by less than the \u0001Ge-Ge\u0002\noptical phonon energy in two different p-SiGe coupled\nasymmetric quantum wells. The observed lifetimes were\nfound to depend on the lattice temperature, but showed no\ndependence on the excitation power over a wide range of\npump intensities, indicating a subpicosecond intrasubband\ncooling time, well below our experimental resolution. How-\never, the reduction of the lifetimes with increasing tempera-\nture was significantly smaller than that observed in GaAs\ndevices2 due to the lack of polar optical phonon scattering.\nOur calculated transition rates included the contributions\nfrom phonon, alloy disorder, IFR, and hole-hole scattering.\nAn average step height \t=1.2\u20131.5 \u00c5 and a correlation\nlength \n=40\u201360 \u00c5 were deduced by comparison with ex-\nperiment, implying that our interfaces were of good quality.\nIn spite of that we found IFR to be the strongest scattering\nmechanism up to about 200 K. In this range, variations as\nsmall as 1 monolayer in the average dimensions of both bar-\nrier and wells were predicted to impact significantly on the\ninterwell transition rates, in very good agreement with the\nmeasured data. At low temperature, IFR scattering rates were\nfound to be larger than those of any other process for as\nsmall a step as 0.6 \u00c5. By comparing our results with those\nobtained in a recent study13 we concluded that, for the inter-\nface quality currently achievable experimentally in III-V and\nIV-IV heterostructures, IFR will dominate all other scattering\nmechanisms for transitions below the optical phonon energy\nat low temperatures.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work has been supported by grants from EPSRC\n\u0001Grant No. GR\/S27528\u0002, DTI \u0001DTI-MNT contract No. 491\n\u201cFast THz Cameras Using Micro- and Nano-Technology\u201d\u0002,\nand the EU project SHINE \u0001IST-2001-38035\u0002.
