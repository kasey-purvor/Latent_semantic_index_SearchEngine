This incorporates the three levels of\nprinciples, programmes, and actions. We conclude by showing that the model encompasses\nthe major factors executed within the Case Study, which covers agility throughout the Product\nIntroduction Process (PIP) and Product Delivery Process (PDP). It appears to be a feature of\nthe successful implementation of agility that it is an organisation-wide shift in culture and\ncannot be restricted to just a few activities.\n1. Introduction\nA key feature of present day business is that it is supply chains which compete, and not\nindividual companies (Christopher, 1992), and the success and failure of supply chains are\nultimately determined in the marketplace by the end consumer. Getting the right product, at\nthe right price, at the right time to the consumer is not only the lynch pin to competitive\nsuccess but also the key to survival. Hence customer satisfaction and marketplace\nunderstanding are crucial elements for consideration when attempting to establish a new\nsupply chain strategy. Only when the constraints of the marketplace are understood can an\nenterprise attempt to develop a strategy that will meet the needs of both the supply chain and\nthe end customer. It is the imperative of matching availability to actual customer\nrequirements which is a distinguishing feature of present day business. Having the right\nproduct available, in the right place at the right time, enables the business to compete in this\nvolatile marketplace.\nSignificant interest has been shown in recent years in the idea of \u2018lean manufacturing\u2019\n(Womack, Jones & Roos, 1990), and the wider concepts of the \u2018lean enterprise\u2019 (Womack, &\nJones, 1996). The focus of the lean approach has essentially been on the elimination of waste\nor muda. The recent upsurge of lean manufacturing can be traced to the Toyota Production\nsystems (TPS) with its focus on the reduction and elimination of waste (Ohno, 1988).\nHowever, the origins of lean manufacture are certainly visible in Spitfire production in the\nUK in World War II, (Childerhouse et. al. 2000) and Keirutsu dates back to the US\nautomotive industry in 1915, (Drucker, 1995). Furthermore JIT delivery with little waste was\nclearly evident in the construction of the Crystal Palace in London (Wilkinson, 2000). In the\ncontext of the present paper, it has been argued elsewhere (Christopher, 2000)) that lean\nInternational Journal of Logistics Research & Application, Vol 5, No. 1, 2002, pp59-74 2\nconcepts work well where demand is relatively stable and hence predictable and where variety\nis low. Conversely in those contexts where demand is volatile and the customer requirement\nfor variety is high, a much higher level of agility is required.\nSo lean manufacturing has a long and distinguished past, and a thriving present. But for some\nyears now it has been argued that it is not a universal recipe for staying ahead of the\nopposition (Richards, 1996). Indeed the cyclical nature of \u201corder qualifiers\u201d versus \u201corder\nwinners\u201d (Hill, 1993) means that this year\u2019s competitive advantage becomes next year\u2019s price\nof entry (Stalk and Webber, 1993, Johannson et al 1993). Hence it is not surprising that\nhaving become competitive based on cost (a \u201clean\u201d attribute) the supply chain is then\nthreatened on its availability performance (an \u201cagile\u201d attribute), and responds by seeking to\nleapfrog to the next arena of competitive advantage, as has been so ably demonstrated in the\nPC marketplace (Christopher and Towill, 2000a).\nIn this paper we describe how a lighting manufacturer, where one of the authors was\nManaging Director, has made the transition from \u201ctraditional\u201d via \u201clean\u201d to \u201cagile\u201d supply,\nand how it copes with producing both commodities and customised products from the same\nsite. The actions taken to achieve this substantial change management programme are then\nmapped onto an agile enterprise enabling model which has been proposed on the basis of the\nprinciples of both lean and agile manufacture. The methodology employed was a single case\nstudy which sought to provide tentative confirmatory evidence of this model. The model\nmarries and exploits the virtues of both lean and agile paradigms, and the case study results\nindicate that the model may be used with confidence as a framework for effective supply\nchain change management generally.\n2. What is Agility?\nAgility is a business-wide capability that embraces organisational structures, information\nsystems, logistics processes and, in particular, mindsets (Christopher and Towill, 2000b). A\nkey characteristic of an agile organisation is flexibility. Indeed the origin of agility as a\nbusiness concept lies in flexible manufacturing systems (FMS). Initially it was thought that\nthe route to manufacturing flexibility was through automation to enable rapid change (i.e.\nreduced set-up times) and thus a greater responsiveness to changes in product mix or volume.\nLater this idea of manufacturing flexibility was extended into the wider business context and\nthe concept of agility as an organisational orientation was born. Table 1 summarises the core\ncharacteristics the Iaccoca Institute have thus associated with agile manufacture (Goldman,\nNagel, and Preiss 1995). It is clear from this table that enabling agility is much more than a\ntechnical problem.\nAgility should not be confused with \u2018leanness\u2019. Lean is about doing more with less. The term\nis often used in connection with lean manufacturing (Womack, Jones, and Roos, 1990) to\nimply a \u201czero inventory\u201d, just-in-time approach. In practice Minimum Reasonable Inventory\n(MRI) is a more relevant philosophy (Grunwald and Fortuin, 1992). Paradoxically, many\ncompanies that have adopted lean manufacturing as a business practice are anything but agile\nin their supply chain. The car industry in many ways illustrates this conundrum. The origins\nof lean manufacturing can be traced to the Toyota Production System (TPS) (Ohno, 1988),\nwith its focus on the reduction and elimination of waste. Leanness may be an element of\nagility in certain circumstances, but by itself it will not enable the organisation to meet the\nprecise needs of the customer more rapidly. Webster\u2019s Dictionary makes the distinction\nclearly when it defines lean as \u201ccontaining little fat\u201d whereas agile is defined as \u201cnimble\u201d.\nInternational Journal of Logistics Research & Application, Vol 5, No. 1, 2002, pp59-74 3\nACTIVITY LEVEL AGILE CHARACTERISTICS\n1.

Thus we\nencounter the paradoxical situation where vehicle manufacture is extremely efficient with\nthroughput time in the factory typically down to twelve hours or less, yet inventory of\nfinished vehicles can be as high as two months of sales. Furthermore, as Marshall Fisher\n(1997) has demonstrated in spite of advertising campaigns to the contrary, the customer still\nhas to wait for weeks or even months (and sometimes forever) to get the car of their choice!\n3. Attributes of Lean and Agile Supply\nBoth agility and leanness demand high levels of product quality. They also require minimum\ntotal lead-times defined as the time taken from a customer raising a request for a product or\nservice until it is delivered. Total lead-time has to be minimised to enable agility, as demand\nis highly volatile and thus difficult to forecast. If a supply chain has long end-to-end lead-\ntime then it will not be able to respond quickly enough to exploit marketplace demand.\nFurthermore effective engineering of cycle time reduction always leads to significant bottom\nline improvements in manufacturing costs and productivity (Towill, 1996).\nLead-time needs to be minimised in lean manufacturing as by definition excess time is waste\nand leanness calls for the elimination of all waste. The essence of the difference between\nleanness and agility in terms of the total value provided to the customer is that service is the\ncritical factor calling for agility whilst cost, and hence the sales price, is clearly linked to\nleanness. However, whereas the Total Cycle Time Compression Paradigm (Towill, 1996),\nwhen effectively implemented, is a sufficient condition for achieving lean production, it is\nonly one necessary condition for enabling agile supply.\nInternational Journal of Logistics Research & Application, Vol 5, No. 1, 2002, pp59-74 4\nDISTINGUISHING\nATTRIBUTES\nLEAN SUPPLY AGILE SUPPLY\nTypical Products Commodities Fashion Goods\nMarketplace Demand Predictable Volatile\nProduct Variety Low High\nProduct Life Cycle Long Short\nCustomer Drivers Cost Availability\nProfit Margin Low High\nDominant Costs Physical Costs Marketability Costs\nStockout Penalties Long Term Contractual Immediate and Volatile\nPurchasing Policy Buy Goods Assign Capacity\nInformation Enrichment Highly Desirable Obligatory\nForecasting Mechanism Algorithmic Consultative\nTABLE 2\nCOMPARISON OF LEAN SUPPLY WITH AGILE SUPPLY : THE\nDISTINGUISHING ATTRIBUTES\n(Source: Mason-Jones, Naylor and Towill , 2000)\nTable 2 illustrates the comparison of attributes between lean and agile supply. In the volatile\nunpredictable marketplace for \u201cfashion\u201d goods, both stockout and obsolescence costs are\npunitive. Consequently the purchasing policy moves from placing orders upstream for\nproducts moving in a regular flow to that of assigning capacity to finalise products in rapid\nresponse mode. As Fisher et al, 1994 have indicated this means forecasting via \u201cintelligent\u201d\nconsultation so as to maximise inputs from \u201crich\u201d marketplace insider sources. Our view\n(Mason-Jones and Towill 1997) is that \u201cinformation enrichment\u201d i.e. immediate sharing of\nmarketplace data throughout the chain is not merely desirable, but obligatory. This is\nnecessary both to reserve future capacity as well as for satisfying current demand.\n4. An Integrated Agile Enterprise Enabling Model\nOur contention is that lean methodologies can be a powerful contributor to the creation of\nagile enterprises. In particular where product ranges can be separated according to volume\nand variability and\/or where the de-coupling concept can be applied, a real opportunity\nexisting for employing hybrid lean\/agile strategies (Christopher and Towill, 2000c). There is\nalso one important sense in which lean precedes agile, and which has been advanced by\nVictor & Boynton (1998) in the context of moving towards mass customisation. This is\nbecause real and effective change requires the mapping and understanding of all the relevant\nbusiness processes in the value chain from customer need identified to customer need\nsatisfied. Thus in an industrial engineering scenario the lean knowledge base is there to be\nexploited in enabling further performance improvements including building in agility\n(Childerhouse et al, 2000).\nFigure 1 is based on our supply chain experiences and suggests a three level framework\nsummarising our view of the agile enterprise. The concept of such a framework was first\nadvocated by (Werr et al. 1997). We have found it extremely useful in bringing together the\nvarious strands which contribute to the agile enterprise. In this integrative model, Level 1\nrepresents the key principles that underpin the agile supply chain; i.e. rapid replenishment;\nInternational Journal of Logistics Research & Application, Vol 5, No. 1, 2002, pp59-74 5\nand postponed fulfilment. Level 2 identifies the individual programmes such as lean\nproduction, organisational agility, and quick response which must be implemented in order\nFIGURE 1\nAN INTEGRATED MODEL FOR ENABLING THE AGILE ENTERPRISE\n(Source: Christopher and Towill, 2000c)\nfor the Level 1 principles to be achieved. Finally Level 3 specifies individual actions to be\ntaken to support Level 2 programmes, for example, time compression, information\nenrichment, and waste elimination. These actions apply equally to the Product Introduction\nProcess (PIP) and to the Product Delivery Process (PDP), Towill, 1997a. Not all the\ncharacteristics shown in Figure 1 may be necessary in any one specific market\/manufacturing\ncontext, but it is likely that the agile supply chain will embody most of these elements. What\nis certain is that much of the conventional wisdom concerning manufacturing strategy,\nsupplier relations and distribution will have to be challenged if real agility is to be achieved\nfrom within the supply chain.\nRapid Replenishment, for example, requires agile suppliers, organisational agility, and a\ndemand driven supply chain (Lowson et.al. 1999). Similarly, postponed fulfilment enables the\nadoption of lean production principles up to the de-coupling point supported by agile\ncapabilities beyond that point (Harrison et. al.1999). Nor must the cultural side be forgotten,\nsince it may be the single biggest barrier to effective change. For example, in moving into an\nagile scenario in the pharmaceuticals sector, it was found that the anticipated IT problems did\nnot arise. Instead, the real stumbling blocks were the human obstacles to be overcome in the\ncreation of an understanding of the new system, and to the creation of a customer based\nregime ~ in other words people problems, (Belk & Steels, 1998). Such reasons could also\nhelp explain why successful industrial implementation of quick response programmes is more\npatchy than expected, (Kohzab,2000). This is just further supporting evidence for the view\npreviously expressed by Andraski (1994) in commenting on the in-effectiveness of many\nImpact of\nAgile\nManufacture\nImpact of\nAgile\nLogistics\nLevel 1\nPrinciples\nLevel 2\nProgrammes\nLevel 3\nActions\nPostponed\nfulfillment\nt\nl ill t\nAgile\nSupply Chain\nil\nl i\nRapid\nreplenishment\ni\nl i t\nOrganisational\nAgility\ni ti l\nilit\nFlexible\nResponse\nl i l\nLean\nProductionti\nEconomies\nof Scale\ni\nl\nStandardisation\/\nModularisation\nt i ti \/\nl i ti\nWaste\nReduction\nt\nti\nAgile\nSupply\nil\nl\nVendor\nManaged\nInventoryt\nSynchronised\noperations\ni\nti\nProcess\nManagementt\nCross\nFunctional\nTeams\nti l\nDemand\nDriveni\nVisibility of\nReal Demand\ni i ilit\nl\nContinuous\nReplenishment\nProgrammes\nti\nl i t\nSet-up\nTime Reduction\nt\ni ti\nQuick\nResponse\ni\nPipeline\nTime\nReduction\ni li\ni\nti\nInternational Journal of Logistics Research & Application, Vol 5, No. 1, 2002, pp59-74 6\nreal-world supply chains. He suggested that this is because in practice '80% of problems that\narise are due to people, not technology'.\nThe importance of people management during effective BPR change programmes is evident\nin the industrial case study which will now be described in detail (Aitken 2000). It explores\nthe actions taken by and options open to a major UK lighting company as it addresses the ever\nincreasingly volatile and competitive architectural lighting market. The continually growing\npressure to globally supply products more cheaply, quickly, and to a higher standard has\nresulted in the company experiencing shorter product life cycles and reduced lead-times.\nManaging this diverse and challenging environment has meant the development of a\nmultifaceted supply chain strategy. At the conclusion of the case study we shall return to our\nIntegrated Model of Figure 1 and see how successful the model is in providing a framework\nfor effective change.\n5. The Need for a Lean and Focussed Lighting Factory\nBefore 1996 the company\u2019s organisation and management of its internal and external supply\nchains was based on a traditional functional approach. Manufacturing managed its material\nflow on a push principle driven by MRP and there was no differentiation between low and\nhigh volume products and between regular or irregular demand items. Productivity was low as\nmanufacturing orders ranged in size from 1 to 1000. Each production order was preceded and\nfollowed by changeovers and downtime. All seven forms of Ohno\u2019s (1988) seven wastes (or\nmuda) were apparent in the internal supply chain and material conversion operations.\nManagement of the external supply chain was at an arm\u2019s-length contractual basis (Sako,\n1992). The supply base was broad as the strategy of the buying function of the company\noperated on the principles of lowest price wins. Buyers routinely moved the source of\ncomponents to a new supplier if the price was lower. New suppliers would be assessed on the\nbasis of price and component quality only. No obligation for repeat transactions was\nanticipated if the supplier did not retain the lowest price.\nDuring 1996, the company developed a new strategy to manage its internal and external\noperations. Manufacturing was restructured to improve customer service and increase\nprofitability. Following an extensive program of data collection and analysis, the production\nfacility was segmented into two distinct sections. One section became a low volume, irregular\ndemand factory employing operators with broad product knowledge. The other area became\nthe high volume, and regular demand factory with focused, repetitive build tasks. These two\nareas were also designed to operate their internal supply chains in distinctly different formats.\nThe low volume area continued with a push (MRP) strategy whilst, the high volume section\noperated a pull (Kanban) strategy. This dual approach is well established in material flow\ncontrol (Parnaby, 1988).\n6. Re-Engineering the Supplier Base\nDue to the significant impact of suppliers on the profitability and flexibility of the company, it\nwas decided to acknowledge vendors as being an intrinsic part of the organisation. Hence\nimproving the performance of the suppliers and the efficiency of the exchange between the\nfirms was recognised as being key to the success of the company. Reducing the number of\ndirect suppliers was seen as essential to maximising use of the limited time and resources\navailable both to the company and its suppliers. In order to lower the number of directly\ninterfacing suppliers, elimination and tiering activities occurred. Existing suppliers were\nassessed for their suitability against the following criteria:\n\uf0a8 Quality performance (PPM)\nInternational Journal of Logistics Research & Application, Vol 5, No. 1, 2002, pp59-74 7\n\uf0a8 Ability to operate with Kanban system (delivery performance)\n\uf0a8 CAD\/CAM facilities (new product development)\n\uf0a8 Geographical location (new product development & delivery performance)\n\uf0a8 Price\nIf a supplier could not or chose not to operate against the quality, logistical or product\ndevelopment criteria laid down by the company they were either delisted (and the components\nswitched to another current supplier) or became a second tier supplier. The result of these\nactivities was a reduction in direct supplier numbers from 267 to less than 100. Such a move\nhas many benefits (Lamming, 1993) including risk reduction. However there are total costs\nbenefits also. The acquisition costs may increase marginally, but there will be a significant\nreduction in the \u201cmanaging the supplier\u201d costs, especially when properly valuing scarce\nExecutive time (Towill, 1997b).\nFollowing the segmentation of the manufacturing plant and the reduction of the supply base it\nbecame possible to simplify the ordering and communications system between \u201cplayers\u201d in\nthe chain. The high volume factory introduced with the assistance and agreement of its\nsuppliers a two-bin, Kanban material ordering system. The support of the suppliers in\nintroducing the simple material ordering system was an early example of greater integration\nof working practises within the supply chain. Only through effective partnering was it\npossible to stop posting weekly MRP schedules. Muda previously observed in these\noperations included inappropriate processing, unnecessary inventory, unnecessary motion,\nexcess waiting time and unnecessary transportation. All were reduced following Kanban\ninstallation.\nLead-times for new product development in the lighting industry in 1996 were typically 18-24\nmonths. For an industry that had become more and more fashion conscious, the time from\nconcept to product delivery was proving costly in terms of pay-back and market leadership.\nOne of the principal driving forces for the company's new approach towards suppliers was the\ndesire to reduce time and cost to market drastically. Hence suppliers within the new\npartnership ethos became involved at the new product design stage. Product development\nactivities thereby became concurrent as opposed to sequential. Supplier\u2019s designers and\nengineers used CAD and CAM technologies to interact directly with the company\u2019s designers\nand engineers at each stage of development. By early 1999 the result of these changes reduced\nthe development lead-time for standard production products from eighteen months to fourteen\nweeks. The lighting company is therefore becoming a fast innovator with many consequential\nbenefits, not least because no pain lasts too long (Stalk and Hout, 1990).\n7. Performance Changes in the Lean and Focussed Lighting Factory\nRestructuring the company\u2019s approach to its management of suppliers would have provided\nlimited benefits if it had not occurred in conjunction with major changes to the internal\noperations of the organisation. The improvements in the efficiency of the supply chain in\nterms of introducing a concept such as Kanban would not have been as effective without the\nrestructuring of the manufacturing function. Simultaneous internal and external changes\npropelled the company\u2019s performance forward in terms of product development, cost and\nlead-time reduction as shown in Table 3.\nThese very creditable performance improvements were achieved through the efforts of both\nsupplier and buyer alike. Integration of supply chain activities and information flows\naccelerated the implementation of lean practises such as Kanban. Operational improvements\nInternational Journal of Logistics Research & Application, Vol 5, No. 1, 2002, pp59-74 8\nfollowed a consistent and deliberate strategy of developing trust and openness in the\nrelationship between supplier and buyer. Suppliers working in partnership with the company\nto develop improvements gained additional sales volumes, which in turn increased the\ninterdependence of both parties to the exchange. Improvements in the relational as well as\noperational performance developed a virtuous circle for both parties in the exchange. In other\nwords the effective design and operation of business interfaces played a vital role in enabling\neffective change as highlighted by Towill (1997a) in adopting a systems approach to supply\nchain design.\nPRODUCT ATTRIBUES LOW VOLUME\nPRODUCTS\nHIGH VOLUME\nPRODUCTS\nPRODUCT CODES\nMATERIAL FLOW\nMATERIAL CONTROL\nDEMAND PREDICTABILITY\nMINIMUM ORDER QUANTITY\nSERVICE OFFERED\nDELIVERY LEAD-TIME\nPRODUCT DEVELOPMENT TIME\nCOSTS (1998\/1995 BASELINE)\n5000\nPUSH\nMRP\nLOW\n1 UNIT\nMADE TO ORDER\n2-4 WEEKS\n6 MONTHS\n85%\n850\nPULL\nKANBAN\nHIGH\nPALLET\nEX STOCK\n0-2 WEEKS\n6 MONTHS\n73%\nTABLE 3\nPERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE FOCUSSED LIGHTING\nFACTORY AS AT 1998\n(Source: Authors based on Aitken, 2000)\n8. The Subsequent Move to Embrace Agility\nThe supply chain and manufacturing improvements that occurred between 1996 and 1998\nprovided the platform for the next stage of development for the company which was finding\nthat leanness alone was no longer a guarantee for success. The 1999 re-engineering phase\naddressed the constant growth of customised, non-standard, product demands from the\nmarket. This increasing market challenge meant a further review of the company\u2019s supply\nchain and manufacturing strategy. Agility and leanness were identified as necessary attributes\nfor a company serving a customised product market. Linked to an ever-increasing\narchitectural demand for customisation was the continual drive by customers for shorter lead-\ntimes. Both these factors forced the company to add another two strategies to managing its\nsupply chain. In addition to the focused factories of MRP and Kanban, it became necessary to\ndevelop a packing centre and a design-and-build division to improve the agility of the\norganisation. These are related in the product variety\/volume predictability matrix shown in\nFigure 2.\nWith increasing globalisation of the lighting market, several parts of the company\u2019s product\nportfolio had become commodity in nature. Customers in the UK now had the opportunity of\npurchasing their lighting products from low labour cost countries such as China. However,\nsupplying the lowest price product was not the UK answer to this challenge. Instead of\ncompeting on price, the company had to find an alternative way of retaining its customers.\nOne way forward was via the improvement of customer service. The strategy adopted by the\ncompany reducing delivery lead-times to days or hours through delaying the completion of\nproduction until the last possible moment. Delivering product on a very short lead-time\nwould allow customers to improve their cash flow thereby countering in part the lower prices\nof Far-East suppliers. Obtaining the necessary lead-time reduction was to be enabled through\nInternational Journal of Logistics Research & Application, Vol 5, No. 1, 2002, pp59-74 9\nthe establishment of a Packing Centre. Some of the products in the Kanban factory would in\nfuture be part assembled. The completion of the production process will then occur in the\nwarehouse when the customer placed an order. The practical application of postponement\nlinked together and exploited the lean approach of the Kanban factory with the agility of the\nPacking Centre. This confirms the importance of postponement in the context of the\nparticular business strategy (Pagh and Cooper 1998, Shewchuck 1998, Feitzinger and Lee\n1997 and van Hoek 1998).\n(Source: Aitken, 2000)\n9. Enabling Customisation\nThe final new supply chain strategy of customisation (Victor and Boynton, 1998) was\nachieved through the opening of a new design-and-build facility specialising in product\ndesign and tailoring items to specific customer requirements. Such customisation meant a\nchange in the existing lean approach to utilising resources in the manufacturing, product\ndevelopment and supply base. The new agile facility was planned to have a different modus\noperandi way from the more rigid lean operation of the standard product factory. One of the\ncritical areas for success in the new division was in its management of knowledge. At the\noutset of the strategy it was realised that the business would only succeed if its intellectual\ncapacity was sufficient to accommodate the dynamics of the market. Capacity was viewed in\nterms of design, engineering, assembly operator, and supply management experience. The\nskill mix of the custom design-and-build was viewed as being similar to the lean factory.\nHowever, the frequency of its application, the time scales it works against and its physical\nlocation were very different.\nWithin the lean factory designers develop products which meet general market (i.e.\ncommodity) needs. The products are designed for easy assembly, material handling and\nstoring. Tooling is \u201chard\u201d in nature and expensive. The total design and tooling time is\nmeasured in months. In contrast the design-and-build division needs to be able to design and\ndeliver product in terms of weeks or days. The ability of this division to meet these needs was\nmet through the use of a design capacity that exists within the network of sub-contractors and\ninternal employees. Several designers co-operate and concurrently work on the same project\nhence increasing the intellectual capacity of the division and compressing lead times. The\nability to link and exploit the tacit knowledge of designers and suppliers provides the custom\ndivision with a competitive advantage.\nDESIGN AND\nBUILD\nM.R.P.\nCONTROLS\nPACKING\nCENTRE\nKANBAN\nCONTROLS\nH\nig\nh\nL\now\nHighLow\nP\nro\ndu\nct\nV\nar\nie\nty\nPredictability\nFig. 2 LIGHTING FACTORY SUPPLY CHAIN STRATEGIES\nInternational Journal of Logistics Research & Application, Vol 5, No. 1, 2002, pp59-74 10\nIn order to compete in the customised market the company decided to integrate its assembly\nprocesses. Fabrication, cutting, drilling and welding tasks meant that the company would have\nto vertically integrate backwards into activities that until recently, were the domain of sub-\ncontract or first tier suppliers. Such backward integration only became possible through the\nsupport of the supplier base and also required a change in the ability of the operators and\nsupervisors in the custom division compared to the lean factory. Within the latter facility\noperators and supervisors followed a prescribed and routine assembly operation. The skill and\nknowledge required for assembly was codified in order to simply co-ordinate and control the\nbusiness. Within the custom design-and-build division lean principles are utilised as mush as\nis practically possible to minimise waste and costs. However, the uniqueness of each customer\norder requires the manufacturing personnel to use their experience and discretion to ensure\non-time delivery.\nVALUE STREAM ATTRIBUTES VALUE STREAM CATEGORY\nGROUPING DETAILS \u201cLEAN\u201d \u201cAGILE\u201d\n1.

The tacit experience based knowledge of the\npersonnel involved in manufacturing within the custom product division is essential in order\nInternational Journal of Logistics Research & Application, Vol 5, No. 1, 2002, pp59-74 11\nto provide the necessary agility in the supply process and its management. This highlights\nthe importance of knowledge management in agile supply chains and the importance of\nensuring that tacit knowledge is captured and shared in the most effectove way (Metes,\nGundry & Bradish, 1998). In this case it was felt that \u2018insourcing\u2019 was the appropriate\nstrategy. The differences and similarities between the two lighting factory supply chain\nmanagement strategies of lean and agile are summarised in Table 4. So as to achieve agility\nvia flexibility the management of the Lighting Company ensured that personnel who operate\nin the design-and-build division have a background in the lean factory. The knowledge and\nexperiences gained in the lean factory provide a firm base from which to develop an agile and\nprofitable business. This confirms our view that in practise being \u201clean\u201d will precede\nbecoming \u201cagile\u201d. (Victor and Boynton, 1998 Christopher and Towill, 2000) A major reason\nis that agility is best achieved by fully understanding and mapping the process, which is a\nnecessary condition for lean operation\n10. Mapping the Lighting Company Actions onto the Integrated Agile Enterprise\nModel\nIt is clear from the foregoing description of the lighting company change programme that it\nhas successfully passed from \u201ctraditional\u201d to \u201clean\u201d manufacture, and is now in a position,\nwhere appropriate, to respond to the customised agile marketplace. At the heart of the\nbusiness strategy is the product variability \u2013 volume predictability matrix with the four\ndelivery channels via MRP Push: Kanban Pull: Packing Centre for postponed assembly: and\nthe Design-and-Build Centre. Each of the businesses are cognate with the others, and the\nlighting company has determined that they are complementary in maintaining their UK base\nand international competitiveness.\nAre these generic lessons to be learned from this successful transition? To establish if this is\nindeed the case we have a posterion mapped the actions of the lighting company onto the\npreviously proposed Integrated Agile Enterprise Model. For each of the eleven actions listed\nin the lowest level of the model, their relative importance in the change programme has been\nFig. 3 HOW THE ACTIONS OF THE LIGHTING COMPANY MAPS\nONTO THE INTEGRATED AGILE ENTERPRISE ENABLING MODEL\nPROGRAMM ES LEVEL ACTIONS LEVEL RELATIVE IM PORTANCE\nLOW HIGH\nLean Production W aste reduction\nStandardisation\/Modularisation\nEconom ies of Scale\nFlexible Response Set-up Time Reduction\nQuick Response Pipeline Time Reduction\nAgile Supply Vendor Managed Inventory\nSynchronised Operations\nO rg anisat io nal Agil ity Process Managem ent\nCross Functional Teams\nDemand Driven Continuous Replen ishm ent\nVisibility of Real Dem and\nInternational Journal of Logistics Research & Application, Vol 5, No. 1, 2002, pp59-74 12\nassessed on a 4-point Likert Scale. Here 4 points have been awarded for high relative\nimportance, and just one point for low relative importance. The outcome is the Likert score\nprofile shown in Figure 3, which appears extremely interesting in identifying tools for\neffective change.\nFor example, at least one action is rated highly important at each of the programmes level, as\nfollows:\n\uf0b7 Lean Production \uf07e Waste reduction\n\uf0b7 Flexible Response \uf07e Set-Up Time Reduction\n\uf0b7 Quick response \uf07e Pipeline Time Reduction\n\uf0b7 Agile supply \uf07e Synchronised Operations\n\uf0b7 Organisational Agility \uf07e Process Management\n\uf07e Cross Functional Teams\n\uf0b7 Demand Driven \uf07e Visibility of Real Demand\nAs we indicated at the time the Integrated Agile Enterprise Model was proposed, we do not\nexpect that each action identified therein will be equally important in every application. What\nis pleasing is that the model clearly does provide a suitable framework for planning and\nimplementing change in support of business strategies which require range of response\nchannels which span the spectrum from commodities to combined products. In fact, the\nlighting company has proven to be a good example of total enterprise design (Kidd, 1995).\nThis requires the active consideration and integration of people, technology, and organisation,\nwith both suppliers and customers forming part of the infrastructure.\n11. Conclusions\nThe current marketplace environment in which organisations conduct their business is both\ndynamic and complex. To compete in such a turbulent scenario requires companies to adapt\nand change in order to thrive and grow. No single paradigm can provide a universal answer\nmeeting all possible market demands. The lighting industry Case Study company described\nherein addressed these problems by tailoring its manufacturing strategies according to the\nneeds of various supply channels. It is very much a market sector where in value stream\nterms \u201cone size definitely does not fit all\u201d (Shewchuk, 1998).\nMeeting customers needs requires that all of these selected strategies be integrated so that the\ntotal business may operate successfully. The mixing of approaches has been possible through\nthe support of multi-skilled employees, suppliers and sub-contractors linked through co-\noperation, trust and openness. Through the complimentary partnership of relevant lean and\nagility practices the Case Study company is gaining a significant competitive advantage. By\nmapping the actions taken by the company onto the proposed Integrated Agile Enterprise\nModel, some generic lessons may be learned and transferred to other companies and to other\nmarket sectors. It is demonstrated herein that in order to compete in volatile markets to be\nlean is not enough. Visibility of demand, flexible and quick response, synchronised\noperations, and organisational agility are each necessary, not just sufficient conditions for\ninternational competitiveness, and must be designed into the agile enterprise.\nReferences\nAitken, J.
