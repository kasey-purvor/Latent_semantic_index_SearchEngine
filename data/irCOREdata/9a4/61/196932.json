These problems arise from a number of factors\n1\n including \ninactivity, inflammation, anaemia, reduced muscle function and increased muscle protein \ncatabolism\n2\n. There is growing evidence that exercise can provide benefits to patients with \nadvanced CKD\n1 \nsuch as improved exercise capacity, a reduction in cardiac risk factors, \nimproved insulin sensitivity and glucose disposal, increased quality of life and reduced \ndepression. However, even though there is some evidence that the serious problem of muscle \nprotein catabolism can be slowed by both strength and endurance exercise training in dialysis \npatients\n2\n, a number of studies have been unable to detect a net increase in lean body mass in \nresponse to such exercise. For example in a study\n3\n involving an 18 week exercise programme \nof aerobic or resistance training, alone or in combination, no significant change in body \ncomposition was observed. This implies that metabolic abnormalities in muscle during CKD \nmay be limiting the anabolic effectiveness of exercise.  \n \nSkeletal muscle abnormalities in CKD patients \nCKD patients exhibit severe muscular atrophy that appears to affect type II fibres more than \ntype I\n4\n. Many abnormalities are present at the ultrastructural level, for example   swollen \nmitochondria, disappearance of the cristae and reduced matrix density\n4\n. Electron microscopy \nhas shown Z-band degeneration, myofilament loss and accumulation of intracellular \nglycogen. Fibre splitting, internalized nuclei and moth-eaten fibres have also been observed \nby light microscopy. Furthermore, this atrophy has also been seen in non-locomotor muscles, \ndemonstrating that these changes are unlikely to be caused purely by disuse, and are probably \na consequence of some aspect of uraemia. As well as the abnormalities in mitochondrial \nstructure described above, these patients also exhibit defective intramuscular energy \n3 \n \nmetabolism\n5\n. Following a bout of exercise, the rate of resynthesis of  phosphocreatinine (PCr) \nis reduced, the inorganic phosphate\/ PCr ratio is elevated, and an abnormally low \nintramuscular pH is observed\n5 \n, indicating that the ability of the myocytes  to restore their pH \nhomeostasis is impaired.  \n \nIn addition to this intracellular pH defect, systemic metabolic acidosis is reported in the \nmajority of CKD patients when their GFR declines to less than 20-25% of normal i.e. CKD \nStage 4 onwards. The degree of acidosis usually correlates with the severity of the renal \nfailure and is the result of a reduced ability to excrete ammonia and titratable acids in the face \nof a reduced reabsorption and synthesis of bicarbonate. Metabolic acidosis is a well-\nestablished cause of increased protein catabolism and muscle wasting\n6\n. The reason for the \nfailure of exercise in CKD to increase muscle mass is unknown, but exercise in CKD patients \ncould potentially result in a transient worsening of the pre-existing metabolic acidosis \nthrough exercise-induced lactic acid generation, especially in view of the low lactate \nthreshold expected in previously sedentary deconditioned patients with CKD. Such acidosis \ncould potentially off-set any anabolic effects gained from the exercise in at least two ways. \nFirstly acidosis blunts anabolic signals through effectors such as mTOR and PKB\/Akt\n6\n, \nsignals which are vital mediators of the hypertrophic effects of exercise on protein synthesis. \nIt is well documented that myocyte growth is regulated by mTOR, at least partly through the \nPI3-K\/PKB signalling pathway and this is probably the pathway that is stimulated in response \nto resistance exercise in vivo resulting in muscle hypertrophy\n7\n. Secondly, possibly through \ndirect inhibitory effects of low pH on active amino acid transporters in skeletal muscle cells\n6\n, \nacidosis in CKD significantly depletes intramuscular pools of free amino acids, thus reducing \ncapacity for protein synthesis, and impairing amino acid-dependent anabolic signalling \nthrough mTOR. \n4 \n \n \nOccult acidosis.  \nAt first sight, judging from conventional measures of acid-base status (such as venous \nbicarbonate concentration or arterial blood pH) there is little direct evidence that exercise in \nCKD induces significant acidification of the blood. However, direct measurements of tissue \ninterstitial fluid pH in animal models of systemic metabolic acidosis suggest that blood \nmeasurements may fail to detect an occult component of acidosis which is confined to the \ninterstitial fluid in the tissues. In rats with normal renal function which were subjected to a \nlevel of dietary acid loading which failed to alter blood pH, significant acidification of the \ntissue interstitial fluid was observed even in the renal cortex, in spite of the animals\u2019 normal \ncapacity for renal acid excretion\n8\n. It should also be noted that previous reports of beneficial \neffects of alkali therapy in peritoneal dialysis patients, for example the study by Stein and co-\nworkers\n9\n, occurred without substantial increases in arterial blood pH, presumably reflecting \nfunctional effects confined to the tissue interstitial fluid. While some\n10\n but not all studies \nusing micro-dialysis probes in healthy humans have found acidification of skeletal muscle  \ninterstitial fluid following muscle contraction in the absence of imposed systemic acidosis; it \nhas also been shown that the fall in the pH of dog muscle interstitial fluid is particularly large \nduring muscle contraction when this is superimposed on a background of pre-existing \nsystemic metabolic acidosis\n11\n, the acidification effects of the systemic acidosis and of the \nlactic acid generated being more than additive. Such interstitial acidification, resulting in a \nthermodynamically less favourable pH gradient for extrusion of intracellular protons by the \ncells, following exercise-induced lactic acid generation, may explain the abnormally \nprolonged and severe intramuscular acidification observed in patients with advanced CKD \nfollowing exercise\n5\n, an observation that has been confirmed by several other laboratories.  In \nhealthy individuals it has also been demonstrated that metabolic acidosis induced by NH4Cl \n5 \n \nadministration, or through diet manipulation, reduces exercise capacity in high intensity \nexercise\n12\n. Intramuscular acidification during exercise was also formerly considered to be a \nmajor factor in the development of fatigue, but more recently this has been questioned\n13\n.  \n \nTreatment to control muscle acidification   \nThe lactic acid response to exercise in CKD may decline spontaneously following a period of \nexercise training: Kouidi and co-workers\n4\n showed that 6 months of a mixed exercise training \nprogramme resulted in lower blood lactate concentrations by the end of the programme, and \nattributed this to a block in glycolysis, resulting in an increase in muscle glycogen levels. \nHowever, it is also likely that this reduced lactate response arises from a training effect on \naerobic metabolism. \n \nIt has also been shown in healthy subjects that alkali ingestion significantly suppresses the \nacidification of muscle interstitial fluid that accompanies one-legged knee-extensor \nexercise\n10\n. This was found to be acting selectively on exercise-induced acidification, because \nalkali had no effect on interstitial pH at rest. However, even though oral sodium bicarbonate \nis a widely used treatment for uraemic metabolic acidosis \u2013 intended to control basal levels of \nacidosis in the non-exercising state, routine administration of additional sodium bicarbonate \nto prevent exercise-induced exacerbation of acidosis carries the theoretical risk of sodium and \nwater retention, resulting in worsening of hypertension. Reducing the titratable (non-volatile) \nacid load which gives rise to the underlying uraemic metabolic acidosis when renal acid \nexcretion fails in CKD is, in principle, a feasible alternative treatment which would avoid the \nundesirable sodium loading associated with alkali therapy. \n \n6 \n \nThe dominant contributor to the daily titratable  acid load of around 40-70mEq of H\n+\n in \nhumans is catabolism of the sulphur amino acids L-cysteine and L-methionine derived from \ndietary protein (Figure 1). These are irreversibly metabolised, primarily by the liver, to \nsulphuric acid or to the alternative non-acidic end product taurine\n14\n (Figure 1). Skeletal \nmuscle also has the ability to convert cysteine to taurine and sulphuric acid (accounting for \nup to 10% of the whole body sulphuric acid production). While dietary protein restriction \n(hence reducing sulphur intake) could reduce this sulphur flux, investigation of novel \nmetabolic manoeuvres to suppress this flux or to divert it from sulphuric acid to taurine \nwould be a worthwhile future research objective. In addition to acid, it is important to note \nthat this metabolic pathway to sulphuric acid also generates significant concentrations of the \ntoxic intermediate sulphite (SO3\n2-\n) from sulphurous acid (H2SO3) owing to the relatively low \nactivity of the enzyme sulphite oxidase encountered in human tissues (Figure 1). Sulphite \naccumulates in patients with advanced CKD, attaining concentrations of approximately 5 \nmicromoles per litre\n15\n - concentrations which are known to induce oxidative stress and hence \ninflammation which is a further important contributor to cachexia. Therefore, in future, \ntherapeutic reduction of endogenous production of sulphuric acid in CKD patients might \ngenerate additional benefits beyond improvements in acid-base balance, which would be of \nvalue to the patients both in the resting and exercising state. \n \nFigure legend \nFigure 1.
