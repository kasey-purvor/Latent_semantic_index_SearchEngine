Cates, Lynn A. Fontana and Charles S. White\nDepartment of Leadership, Instruction and Technology, Lehigh University, 111\nResearch Drive, Mountaintop Campus, Bethlehem PA, USA\nAbstract\nThis article describes the rationales behind the design decisions made in creating\nThe Civil War Interactive, an interactive multimedia instructional product based on\nKen Burns''s film series The Civil War.\nIntroduction\nKen Burns's film series The Civil War was first aired on the Public Broadcasting System in\nthe United States in the fall of 1990. Its impact was immediate. From the first night, it was the\nsubject of nationwide discussion and its audience grew progressively larger until, by the final\nevening, the total viewing audience was estimated to be 50 million. Since then, the series has\nbeen rebroadcast several times, reaching still more viewers.\nIn the century and a quarter since the end of the Civil War, the United States has changed\ndramatically, moving through the Industrial Revolution, the American Civil Rights Movement,\nthe Jet Age, the Space Age, and now into the Information Age. Despite these changes and the\nintervening years, the American Civil War appears still deeply embedded in the American\npsyche. It was at once both a unifying and divisive event. In the words of Shelby Foote:\n'Before the Civil War, the United States were, after the war, the United States was.' The\ncountry therefore gained a sense of unity and indivisibility as a result of the war, 'one nation,\nunder God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all' (Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag of the\nUnited States of America). At the same time, a battle between two large regions of the country\nhad been settled by force of arms, producing a 'winner' and a 'loser'. There are few who\nwould question that the Civil War had a powerful effect on both Northern and Southern\nphilosophy, and on American politics in general. The American Civil War is an event of great\nreal and symbolic importance in American history, an event that students need to appreciate\nfully in order to understand many of the social, political, and economic issues at work in the\nUnited States today.\n5\nWardM. Cates et al Designing a multimedia instructional environment\nUnfortunately, students display seriously limited knowledge about the Civil War. In a national\nsurvey of history knowledge conducted in 1986 (Ravitch and Finn, 1987), 68% of American\n17-year-old students could not place the war in the correct half century, and only one in four\ncould place Lincoln's presidency in the correct 20-year period. As Ravitch and Finn wrote:\nNot even the strongest history students have a secure purchase on the\nchronological setting of the Civil War ... Yet we would contend that it is\nimpossible to understand American history at all if one lacks any idea of when\nthe Civil War occurred. It is not only the single most traumatic and decisive\ndomestic event since the thirteen colonies won their independence from Britain;\nit is also the anchoring event of the nineteenth century, the climatic conflict to\nwhich other major events led and from which many others resulted, (pp. 49-50)\nThe results of the 1988 assessment were no more reassuring (NAEP, 1990c). That assessment\nshowed little change from the 1986 findings. Further, it showed that almost half of the\nstudents surveyed lacked an understanding of key 'historical terms, texts, and relationships'\n(p.7). Students demonstrated a tenuous grasp of the inter-relationships among events prior to\nand subsequent to the Civil War. In short, students did not appear to understand the\nsignificance of the war, nor to comprehend the diversity of both its causes and results.\nThe report of the National Commission on Social Studies in the Schools (1989) suggested\nprinciples for teaching aimed at producing greater understanding in American students.\nAmong their recommendations were the following:\nContent knowledge from the social studies should not be treated merely as\nreceived knowledge to be accepted and memorized, but as the means through\nwhich open and vital questions may be explored and confronted, (p.3)\nStudents must be made aware that just as contemporary events have been\nshaped by actions taken by people in the past, they themselves have the capacity\nto shape the future, (p.3)\nLearning materials must incorporate a rich mix of written matter, including\noriginal sources, literature and expository writing; a variety of audiovisual\nmaterials including films, television, and interactive media; a collection of items\nof material culture including artefacts, photographs, census records and\nhistorical maps; and computer programs for writing and analyzing social,\neconomic, and geographic data. Social studies coursework should teach students\nto evaluate the reliability of all such sources of information and to be aware of\nthe ways in which various media select, shape, and constrain information, (p.4)\nWorking with funds from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, The Civil War Interactive\nProject worked with Ken Burns to design an interactive multimedia instructional product\nbased on Burns's film series. After consulting with our advisory board of noted historians and\neducators, we established four goals for the project.\nOur principal goal was to help learners recognize that the Civil War, like all events in history,\nwas the product of numerous social, political, and economic forces that inexorably influenced\nthe lives of individuals. We hoped to help students learn to recognize the human factor in the\nequation of history, to understand the importance of inter-relationship among events,\n6\nALT-J VOLUME 1 NUMBER 2\nindividuals, groups, ideas, and locations, and to see how a single pivotal event can influence\nthe flow of history from that date onward.\nThe second goal was to help students comprehend why there is so much disagreement about\nhistorical events in general, and about the Civil War in particular, even among extremely\nwell-informed people. In addressing this goal, we hoped to teach students to identify how\npoint-of-view shapes perception and interpretation, and to develop in them the ability to\nrecognize examples of bias, limited competence to judge, fallacious reasoning, and similar\ncritical issues in evaluating primary and secondary sources. We felt that students needed to\nunderstand the important role that regional and personal interest play in interpretation, and to\nlearn to spot such interests in materials to which they are exposed. We also hoped to help\nstudents come to appreciate how complex the process of historical interpretation is, and to\nlearn to use the tools of historians and other logical thinkers to assist in structuring their own\narguments.\nOur third goal was to help students and teachers learn to work in hypermedia\/multimedia\nenvironments, thereby providing them with information-handling skills that they may need in\nfuture as they are exposed to more and more sources and types of information. In this way,\nstudents and teachers could learn to cope with the demands of new technology and to make\nthe most of the power of that technology. We wanted to equip them with strategies for\nmanaging information, to help them learn to distinguish relevant from irrelevant information,\nand to use that criterion to select appropriate supporting materials from among those available.\nThe fourth goal for the project was to use the emotional power of film and video to draw\nstudents into the inquiry process. We hoped that this would, in turn, lead students to explore\nprimary source materials and develop their inquiry skills. In keeping with this goal, we\nincluded in the product additional primary source materials that do not appear in the film\nseries. We also worked carefully to incorporate both implicit and explicit instruction in the\napplication of the inquiry process to historical investigation.\nEarly in the project we decided that our initial designs and early prototype would utilize level\n3 multimedia. This meant storing the video segments from the series on a two-sided 12-inch\nvideodisc, along with selected additional graphics, and using a computer program as the\ncontrol for access to this disc. In addition, the computer program would supply extra text and\ngraphics, and would provide both instructional organization and support for learners. Materials\nstored on the videodisc would be displayed on a separate large classroom monitor connected\nto the videodisc player while the computer control program, additional text materials, graphs,\nand animations would be displayed on the computer's monitor.\nAs we examined the products currently on the market and considered exactly how we wanted\nour product to operate, we became aware that some educational multimedia products appeared\nto confuse a visual database with an instructional environment. Products whose principal use\nis as a visual database or reference work need, primarily, to have a well-organized and logical\ndatabase structure and a powerful user interface that allows users to manipulate the database\nin as many ways as might prove useful. The usual assumption is that 'more powerful' users\nwill manipulate the database in more powerful and incisive ways and that 'less powerful'\nusers will utilize the materials in the database in less powerful and more superficial ways.\nNovice users, almost by definition, will likely be less powerful users. Implicit in the design of\nmost reference works is a belief that users bring understanding to their searches and that this\n7\nWardM. Cates et al Designing a multimedia instructional environment\nunderstanding then enables them to take advantage of powerful features of the program to\nextract the desired materials.\nIn contrast, in an instructional environment, we expect users to be novices. Learners\ntraditionally are expected to develop understandings of the material under study as they study\nit, not to bring such understandings to the setting as prerequisites. An instructional\nenvironment is expected to be supportive, to help novice learners make transitions from\nnon-understanding or naivet6 to increasingly sophisticated understandings and conclusions.\nClassroom teachers often help learners accomplish these transitions through careful structuring\nof the materials to be presented, through Socratic questioning, and through carefully guided\nexploration and discovery followed by debriefing sessions in which learners are given a\nchance to draw conclusions about what they have learned.\nACTIVITY SELECTION SCREEN\nC^J Select an activity by clicking:\n, ) ferrC11\nINQUIRY BUREAU OF\nINVEST!GOTION\nLaun the steps of inquiry\nfnj ymVf x n u l H d i\nproductions.\nFour introductory toun\noflhtGvflWir.\nAccess to topics*\nindMognphiec.\nFigure 1: Main activity selection screen\nFrom our discussions with teachers and our own observations, we were aware that students\nand teachers appeared to use present multimedia products in three main ways: (1) as source\nmaterials for student reports; (2) as packaged presentations of content, not unlike regular films\nor videotapes; and (3) as source materials for individual student or teacher presentations.\nPresent uses did not appear to emphasize use of multimedia materials as a primary form of\ninstruction, however. This fact may be attributable in large part to the earlier discussed failure\nof many products to provide any actual instruction, viewing themselves, instead, as reference\nresources. The Civil War Interactive^ instructional environment was designed to address the\nthree most frequent uses through its three main strands: Inquiry Bureau of Investigation,\nGuided Tours, and Custom Expeditions. A major distinction, however, was the product's\nexplicit emphasis on providing direct instruction and instructional support in all three strands.\n8\nALT-J VOLUME 1 NUMBER 2\nInquiry Bureau of Investigation\nThe Inquiry Bureau of Investigation (or IBI) consists of two parts: the Bureau and the\nProduction Console. The Bureau is actually a bureau of drawers, each drawer representing\none of the five steps in the inquiry process. Inside each drawer, users find tools and guidance\nappropriate to that step. Users wishing to proceed systematically step by step through the\ninquiry process, or learners who are new to the inquiry process, can use the progression\nthrough the drawers to help them follow the inquiry process. Users can go directly from an\ninquiry-process-step drawer to the Production Console to explore the multimedia database or\nto locate a particular sight they wish to find and can then go back to the Bureau drawer they\nleft. In this way, it is possible for a learner to be supported in the inquiry process while still\nlocating the materials he or she needs to create a multimedia presentation or report.\nPresentations by noted historians and experienced historical investigators can supply learners\nwith role models to help them learn how to approach an investigation, and presentations\naddressing the steps in the inquiry process are also available in the Bureau's drawers.\nINQUIRY BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION\ndick on Dr. Know for advice on using the Bureau of Investigation\nor on the User's Guide to learn how to use the production console.\n| \u00ab \u2014 QU h\nUIDEO EOITDA\no o\nfiUDIO EDITOR\n. . I 1 I I - noDEn\nFigure 2: Inquiry Bureau of Investigation\nMore experienced users can go directly to the Production Console where they may explore the\nmultimedia database freely. They can locate any material in the database using a series of\npowerful search strategies. Once the desired material is located, they may examine it and\ndecide if it is what they wish to use. If they decide to use it, they can then include it in the\npresentation or report they are producing. At any point in this production process, users can\njump over to the Bureau to get some guidance on how to use the inquiry process to help in\ntheir efforts.\nThe Production Console is designed to enable users to edit video and audio segments,\nmanipulate the database, and import and export digitized versions of materials for use in their\nmultimedia presentations. These latter capabilities should enable users to bring into the system\n9\nWardM. Cates et al Designing a multimedia instructional environment\nsuch things as files of text, digitized audio, and digitized video, as well as allowing them to\nget printed copies of documents or graphics in the database or to export their own files for use\nin an external word processor or graphics program. In addition, the Production Console is\ndesigned to allow users to connect with appropriate online information services as such\nbecome available.\nUsers may also use the Production Console to manipulate the materials they collect in their\nscrapbooks (see below) as they complete guided tours. These materials may then be converted\nto more formal presentations or reports using the powerful editing capabilities of the\nProduction Console.\nGuided tours\nGuided tours focus on presenting learners with carefully structured presentations of a limited\nscope of the materials available in the multimedia database. Each tour focuses on a specific\ntheme and helps to illustrate that theme through presenting the learner with information drawn\nfrom the database. Using the tourist-through-time metaphor, we created tours made up of\nstops, with each stop containing a limited number of sights. While we intentionally used the\ns-i-g-h-t spelling, emphasizing the sightseeing aspect of exploration, we also hoped that\nlearners, as they viewed primary documents and saw images of various locales of import\nduring the Civil War, might unconsciously think also of sight's homophonic cousins, cite and\nsite.\nIn order to help students gain an understanding of the inquiry process, we organized each tour\naround a thoughtful question. Thoughtful questions help learners to identify why they are\nabout to see what they are. Each thoughtful question is further illuminated by two enabling\nquestions. Enabling questions help to focus the learner's attention on questions whose answers\nmay enable learners to find the answer to a tour's thoughtful question.\nEach tour is also designed to help students learn the inquiry process and requires the learner\nto choose between two available hypotheses. Once a learner selects a hypothesis, all later\nadvice and guidance relates to the testing of that specific hypothesis. Guided tours model the\ninquiry process, thereby teaching the process implicitly.\nWe were particularly sensitive to the need to support learners. We were aware that they\nappeared as a group to lack content knowledge and understanding (NAEP, 1990a,b,c),\nthinking skills (Beyer, 1988, 1991; Costa, 1985), and an understanding of the persuasive\nnature of film (Cates, 1990). We felt that The Civil War Interactive needed to address all three\nof these inadequacies in its instructional environment. We therefore included an advisement\nfeature, Dr. Know. Dr. Know is available from all tour screens and offers three types of\nadvice, which we labelled as Es, Ts, and Qs.\nEs consist of advice on how to explore the sights available at a stop. They focus on\naddressing varied learner intentions, and take a more global view of the content and purpose\nof sights at the stop.\nTs consist of guidance and advice related to thinking skills. They focus on helping learners\nunderstand how individual sights at a stop, or a stop as a whole, relate to a tour's questions\nand to the hypothesis that the learner selected.\n10\nALT-J VOLUME 1 NUMBER 2\nThoughtful Question:\nHow do people cope when their lives\nare interrupted by war?\nWar is a form of national crisis which transforms institutions and\nthe lives of people.\nIt changes the social, political, economic, and cultural life of a nation.\nThis tour explores the Civil War as a national crisis and investigates\nhow people coped with the changes that it produced.\nHELP \u2022wet\nFigure 3: Sample Guided Tour thoughtful question\nI ENABLING .1 How do individuals in different walks of life\nI\"\"15\u2122\"1'! cope with the effects of war?\nIn any nation, the course of an individual's life is lied to his or her station\nin life \u2014 rich or poor, vorker or employer, slave or slave-ovner,\nman or voman, leader or rollover.\nTo understand hov people coped vith the Civil War, v e must explore\nhov individuals vith different roles in society and in different valks\nof life coped vith the upheaval caused by the var.\nENABLING\/\nQUESTION What aspects of daily life are altered by war?\nHov people coped vith the Civil War depended on HOW their\nlives vere interrupted.

These questions\nattempt to do what a talented teacher guiding a learner in discovery might do: focus student\nattention on critical aspects of the material under study, point out inconsistencies or dissonant\ncontentions, or pose questions that stimulate deeper thought about key issues.\nTo help learners recognize the role viewpoint plays in historical interpretation, Dr. Know\noften plays up differences in viewpoint and opinion. To encourage students to think about and\ninteract with the sights they see, they are encouraged to make entries in an electronic journal\n11\nWard M.

Cates et al Designing a multimedia instructional environment\nCustom expeditions\nThis portion of The Civil War Interactive allows users to create their own tours to share with\nothers. As was the case in the Inquiry Bureau of Investigation, learners also have access to the\nsearch capabilities of the Production Console. In Custom Expeditions, however, users are able\nto impose formal tour structure on the materials they select by identifying and grouping sights\ninto stops and then grouping stops into tours. Users can also add thoughtful and enabling\nquestions and other properties of guided tours to the custom expeditions they create. In this\nway, students or teachers may utilize the materials in the database to create their own highly\nstructured and supported instructional presentations. We felt that the ability to build such\ncustomized tours using the structure of guided tours (including implicit modelling of the\ninquiry process) could be of great value in helping teachers make the most of the product,\nparticularly in terms of matching it to local school curricula.\nOverall design concerns\nMany interactive multimedia products appear almost too powerful and complex for their\nintended users. In this case, our intended audience of users consists primarily of 8th and 11th\ngrade US students taking American History courses. A well-documented failing of many\nmultimedia programs is cognitive overload (Oren, 1990; Phye and Andre, 1988). Cognitive\noverload occurs when the user is overwhelmed by the number or complexity of the options\navailable, and loses a sense of direction and purpose. Often designers refer to this as getting\nlost in hyperspace. The Civil War Interactive attempts to prevent cognitive overload in a\nnumber of ways. It uses no more than eight icons in consistent locations along a control strip\nat the bottom of the screen, thereby honouring Miller's (1956) guideline on working memory\nlimitations. Each icon is coupled with a descriptive one- or two-word label to help make its\nfunction clear. Screens always contain instructions to the user (such as 'Click on any of the\nitems below to ...\" ) and online help is always available from any screen.\nTo prevent users from losing a sense of where they are in the program, the left-hand portion\nof guided tour screens is dedicated to a navigation column, which displays in descending\nsequence the progression of steps that led the user to where he or she is in the program.\nPictures in the navigation column illustrate the screens that led to the present screen.\nRecognizing how easily users can become disoriented in navigating, the product never goes\nmore than four levels down. Clicking on any of the four screen-pictures that may appear in\nthe navigation column returns users to that screen immediately.\nAnother design concern was the level and nature of learner engagement. We believed that\nuser choices should be meaningful and that users should have some sense of control. To\nencourage meaningful interaction and a sense of personal control, we included choices at all\nlevels of the program and emphasized the personal nature of inquiry, particularly in terms of\nselecting tours, choosing a hypothesis, and collecting souvenirs and writing notes in the\njoumal\/scrapbook. Recognizing that learner control also means the ability to quit and restart\nwithout penalty, we created the map pin feature. The map pin enables users who exit before\ncompleting an activity to rejoin the activity at precisely that point when they next restart the\nprogram. To encourage learners to assume a sense of responsibility, we employed the\nlanguage of self-attribution: 'My choice of hypothesis is ...' and 'I would like ...' (Keller and\nSuzuki, 1988).\n14\nALT-J VOLUME 1 NUMBER 2\n- N Prewar life| 1 in the South\nClick on any\nphotograph to\nlearn more:Agriculture &\nthe Plantation I System\nFigure 9: Screen illustrating the navigation column\nThe Civil War Interactive also emphasizes a sense of control by providing users with devices\nto help them estimate the scope and length of time required to complete activities. Users can\nexamine brief descriptions of tours (tourbooks) before selecting them; stops often utilize\ndescriptive markers that summarize what the stop covers and time clocks that indicate how\nlong a stop should require to complete if all sights are viewed; and users can skip sights or\nentire stops as they choose.\nWe observed that many computer-based educational materials were used by single students in\nisolation. This often appeared to be the case when they worked with educational multimedia\nproducts, particularly those that appear to be designed to be used primarily as references. We\nhope to encourage a more collaborative and cooperative approach to learning using The Civil\nWar Interactive, an approach in which learners and teachers work together to find the answers\nto meaningful questions and to see how history, in general, and the Civil War in particular,\nrelate to the present and the future. Accompanying print materials are designed to illustrate a\nwide range of ways in which to use the product, including one student working alone, small\ngroups of students working independently, one teacher working with a small group, one\nteacher working with an entire class, and several subject-matter teachers working together\nwith their students.\nThe future\nThe Civil War Interactive project is an on-going one. In December 1990 we completed a\n200-page design document specifying how the product was to function. In the first half of\n1992 we created a small working prototype of the product to test out its operation and refine\nits design. Over the next year we demonstrated the prototype, observing reactions and\ngathering suggestions for changes. The third stage of the project will be the actual\ndevelopment of the commercial version of the product, complete with field tests in a variety\nof instructional settings and configurations.\n15\nWard M.
