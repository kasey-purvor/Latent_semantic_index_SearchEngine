However, not far behind has been the cumbrous yet essential 'big box' of \ncontainerisation, shipping all manner of goods across the planet on great vessels \nremorselessly circling the globe. Critiques of global trade have latched upon the counter \nimage of these mighty ships' ruinous carcasses beached and being broken in South Asia. Here \nthen is the antipode of globalisation - ships, once carrying cargoes now themselves sold \naround the globe for scrap and ending up broken up according to the very logics of cheap \nlocations that their routes made possible. This paper interrogates these counter-images of \nglobal capitalism. Looking at the works of various photographers it examines how waste \nships are made to work aesthetically. It examines the photodocumentary and traditions of the \nindustrial sublime to find \u2017time-images\u2018 that speak to the material and labour worlds of global \ncapital. \n \nKey words: globalization, photography, aesthetics, ship breaking, Bangladesh \n \n  \n 2 \n \n\u201cWe all know how ships are born, how majestic vessels are nudged into the ocean with a \nbottle of champagne. But few of us know how they die. And hundreds of ships meet their \ndeath every year. From five-star ocean liners, to grubby freighters, literally dumped with all \ntheir steel, their asbestos, their toxins on the beaches of some of the poorest countries in the \nworld, countries like Bangladesh.\u201d \nBob Simon, 60 Minutes, CBS 2006  \n \n \nThis paper examines the figuring of the globalized commodity world as material process \nthrough the representation of waste. To do this it looks to images critical of globalization that \nuse the global flows of waste to reveal the hidden underside of capitalism. The paper focuses \nupon the figure of the ship as embodying global flows and ship breaking as a global waste \nflow. In doing this it passes through the work of key photographers to illustrate different \naesthetics of globality, materiality and waste. It contrasts the documentary aesthetics of those \nlike Sebastiao Salgad\u00e3o or Sean Smith focusing on global labour with the materialist \naesthetic of Edward Burtynsky. It asks what aesthetic registers are available to depict the \nwasting processes of globalised capitalism. \n \nThe paper asks us to move into the temporal dimension of commodities through their wasting \nand disposal \u2013 comprising the abject material of capitalism, which we seek to expel from our \nview and consciousness yet is an intrinsic part of consumption. Rendering waste invisible to \nits producers is now made all the easier by flows that take used commodities from consumers \nand break them into various constituent parts elsewhere around the globe. Discarded clothing, \nconsumer durables, electronic goods, paper and plastic, have global circulations (for example, \n 3 \nsee Lepawsky and McNabb 2009 for the routes taken by e-waste) to differentiated \ndestinations for instance e-waste in West Africa (European Environment Agency, 2009), and \nSouthern China (Iles, 2004; Tong & Wang, 2004) or textiles in India (Norris, 2005), where \nthey are \u2017recycled\u2018 into yet further commodities.  \n \nExemplary of this labour of displacement is the breaking of ships, 80% of which now occurs \nin South Asia. The imagery of this has been picked up by campaign groups in powerfully \nillustrated reports, with documentary photography highlighting the abject labour conditions \nand environmental damage. As Cairns notes, these NGO and photographic campaigns have \ngained traction in the media but have been unstudied in academic literatures (Cairns, 2007, \npage 266). The paper counterposes this concerned documentary photography to more \naestheticised work that the paper argues recovers a polyvalent landscape, reflecting the epic \nscale of capitalism and the ambiguous meanings of the wastescapes in the shipbreaking \nbeaches.  \n \nAfter Deleuze (1986, page 51; 1989) this calls for both movement-images and time-images to \ncapture a world of flows. The movement image reflects a commitment \u2017to show or create the \nkind of space of movement that is prior to the representation of static objects\u2018 (Thrift & \nDewsbury, 2000, page 417). The paper takes the movement image of the ship as a chronotope \nfor global flows in a mass consumer world. The time-image suggests a move away from \nstatic objects as not just spatial but temporal \u2013 to see objects temporary stabilisations of \nthings and relations, as coming in to being and as coming apart.  The time-image or \nchronosign (Deleuze 1989, page 213) is an indirect representation of time, that, rather than \nmapping time through movement, sees time as transformations between different states \n(Rodowick, 1997, page 84). Time images are thus the moment of recognition of linkages, and \n 4 \nof disturbance, where disjunctural states are shown to connect (Deleuze, 1989, page 55). \nDeleuze\u2018s time-images though tend to be connected to an affirmative will to power and \nbecoming, whereas this paper asks rather whether they might also look at the opposite \nprocesses of un-becoming. \n \n \nGlobality, Materiality and Unbecoming Things \n \nImagery of globalization all too often depicts an endless process of acceleration going hand-\nin-hand with a dematerialization until electronic communications create global instantaneity \u2013 \nsummed up in the powerful figure of the shrinking world of time space compression (Kirsch, \n1995). There are well known criticisms that the pattern is clearly more intricately variegated \nthan such unidirectional accounts suggest (Crang, 2007). Allan Sekula argues we need a \nmovement-image that counters this unilinear and dematerializing narrative: \nMy argument is against the commonly held view that the computer and \ntelecommunications are the sole engines of the third industrial revolution. In effect, I \nam arguing for the continued importance of maritime space in order to correct the \nexaggerated importance attached to that largely metaphorical construct, \u2015cyberspace\u2016, \nand the corollary myth of \u2015instantaneous\u2016 contact between different spaces. I am \noften struck by the ignorance of intellectuals in this respect: the self-congratulating \naggrandizement of \u2015information\u2016 frequently is accompanied by peculiar erroneous \nbeliefs among these is the widely held quasi-anthropomorphic notions that most of the \nworld\u2018s cargo travels as people do, by air. This is an instance of the blinkered \nnarcissism of the information specialist: a \u2015materialism\u2016 that goes no further than \u2015the \n 5 \nbody\u2016. In the imagination, e-mail and airmail come to bracket the totality of global \nmovement (Sekula, 1995, page 50) \nTo speak to the vast material flows, and the environmental limits and consequences of a \nglobalised world, Sekula turns to shipping.  \n \nThe sea and the ship offer a movement-image that speaks to global flows but also begins to \nopen new lines of thinking through time. DeLoughrey (2007, page 55) argues that \u2017[u]nlike \nterrestrial space, the perpetual circulation of ocean currents means that as a space, [the sea] \nnecessarily dissolves local phenomenology and defracts the accumulation of narrative. In \nother words, the sea suspends and distorts terrestrial markings of temporality\u2018. The sea speaks \nto transoceanic subjects and cyclical times. The movement image of the ship has been used to \nsuggest the hybrid, fluid, mobile systems of globalization be that in the black Atlantic \n(Gilroy, 1993), or circulating radical culture around the eighteenth century north Atlantic \n(Linebaugh & Rediker, 2000) or suggesting \u2017an industrial republic of the ocean\u2018 (Sekula, \n1995, page 118) to mutineering syndicalists at the end of World War 1. However, current \nglobal imaginaries leave the sea as an apparently transcended arena rendering it \u2017a vast \nreservoir of anachronisms, its representation redundant and over-coded\u2018. This makes it a \nfertile site for discordant ways of depicting \u2017the imaginary and material geographies of the \nadvanced capitalist world\u2018 (Sekula, 1995, page 51).  \n \nFor Sekula, \u2017[m]odernity entails a maritime victory of the detail over the panorama: these \ndetails circulate within a generalized stream of consumption... The sea is everywhere and \nnowhere at the same time, but only in decantable quantities\u2018 (Sekula, 1995, page 107). The \nimage is of the abstract as expansive yet quantified \u2013 and commodified. His own photography \nsets panoramic works, that show the scale of material, against detailed studies of small dolls \n 6 \nor wrenches left by crews, that show the imprint of the hidden labour enabling global flows. \nExplicitly drawing upon Foucault\u2018s formulation of the ship as a heterotopia, being \nmicrocosms of globalised space, he adds an extended and fluid spatiality where movement \nopens out fixed spaces. As heterotopias ships bring together commodities in strange \nconjunctions, as in his picture where weapons for Iran and Iraq are loaded onto the same ship \nin Spain and for \u2017one moment the global supply network is comically localized\u2018 (Sekula, \n1995, page 32). Ships also still circulate populations, with many sailors from poor countries \namong ports and on ships (Borovnik, 2004), so the ship as movement-image creates a form of \n\u2017connective aesthetics\u2018 of global entanglement (Cook & et al, 2000 ).  \n \nThis paper follows this focus upon shipping but connects it to images around \u2017wastes\u2018 \u2013 \nproducts at the end of their lives, dumped, discarded and being dismantled. It does this for \nthree reasons.  First, thinking through waste creates a time-image that discloses the instability \nof things. An image that goes beyond a focus on being, and even one seeing things as always \nbecoming, with its sense of positive vitality, to one that stresses their undoing and \nunbecoming. The second reason, is that waste highlights unbecoming things in the adjectival \nsense where synonyms include discreditable, indecorous, and unflattering. Those \nconnotations make waste amenable to being used politically to highlight the negative \noutcomes of globalization. In part the paper is a response to the powerful images of global \nwaste used by NGOs in strikingly illustrated reports, particularly about ship breaking (e.g. \nGreenpeace, 2005). Third, if the materiality of commodity flows is too easily forgotten, then \nthe large global flows of wastes which have emerged in tandem with them restates their \nmateriality. It is the ultimately abject material \u2013 denied, concealed and distanced from the \nbody social yet irrevocably connected to it. Those are the scatological registers through which \n 7 \nthe Greenpeace campaign coordinator explained why they targeted south Asian ship \nbreaking: \nBecause here there is a very direct link with Western companies [who] pretend to us \nhere with glossy leaflets that they are so environmentally responsible. And it is a \nshame when they export their shit to the developing world. (quoted in Langewiesche, \n2000) \nThe return of waste, its irruption into social consciousness, can be profoundly unsettling and \nhas been powerful in energizing environmental campaigns (Hawkins, 2007). Ships as waste \nbrings the restless movement of globalization, the temporalities of objects and the politics and \naesthetics of waste into conjunction. \n \nImages of wastes fit poorly into the categories of aesthetic theory concerned with beauty \n(Arntzen & Brady, 2008) though some art has explored their possibilities (Vergine, 2007). \nThree aesthetic registers are most resonant: the picturesque (especially the ruin), the sublime \nand the realist. For the first, if classically everything that was symmetrical, whole and smooth \nwas associated with the beautiful then the picturesque addressed the irregular, the \nmultifarious and worn. Anything damaged, used or in the process of decay was potentially \npicturesque (Kemp, 1990, page 104). Thus in the 1920s and '30s, photography began to \ndevelop this repertory with popular leitmotifs of scrap heaps, wrecked automobiles, and \ndemolished buildings offering a melancholy reflection on the mutability of earthly things \n(Kemp, 1990, page 117-8). That sense of natural decay, mutability and melancholia may also \nbe found in the ruin which, Simmel (1958) argued, was the moment when the imposition of \nart and artifice upon natural materials was overcome by the forces of those materials \nreverting to their own natures \u2013 a time-image of entropic decay. More contemporarily \nindustrial ruins have been seen as sites which escape or fall out of  previous imposed \n 8 \nmeanings (Edensor, 2005b, page 60 ;  Edensor, 2005c) either offering haunting and \nmelancholy decay or heterotopic collisions of overlain social orders and original social orders \n(Edensor, 2005a) \u2013 not Sekula\u2018s heterotopic movement-image but an hetero-chronic time-\nimage. Some objects may acquire meanings through decay, especially in the twilight when a \n\u2017half-identity\u2018 links them to their original form and status (DeSilvey, 2006, pages 320, 327).  \n \nSecondly, variants of the sublime may capture some of the aesthetic registers of global capital \nand ruination. Kant\u2018s definition marked out the mathematical sublime, where sheer scale \nproduces awe, as against \u2017dynamic sublime\u2018 where \u2017it is not a vastness that is initially \nincommensurable to the imagination but the limitless scope of nature\u2018s destructive capacities\u2018 \n(Lang, 1997, page 428). DeLoughrey (2007, pages 51) shows that the vastness of the ocean \nemerged in British popular culture, from the eighteenth century, as a specific cultural figure \noffering sublime immensity and gothic terror. The oceanic sublime she sees as deeply linked \nwith the emergence of global economies functioning from then until the present as capital\u2018s \nmyth element (page 101), where oceans are placed under a logic of erasure and \ndesubstantialised. So in theory, too, \u2017the ocean perhaps more than any other space on earth \nhas either been ignored or read as tansparent, transitive, asocial place by the vast majority of \nspatial theorists\u2018 (page 53). Instead one might draw upon the aesthetic connection of the \nocean and waste, both stemming from the Latin \u2017vastus\u2018 for oceans and empty, uninhabited \nwastelands, and indeed the eighteenth century shared histories of the words sewer and shore \n(page 81). Thinking through oceanic waste moves us away from focusing upon nature\u2018s \ndestructive forces to those of capital, and the antinomies of waste and value. Those \nconnections are apparent in paintings such as Turners Slavers throwing overboard the Dead \nand the Dying (1840), but it is instructive that the rendering humans as waste hidden for \ncritics like Ruskin under the natural sublime of tempestuous ocean (page 62). The sublime \n 9 \nclassically sets up an aesthetic encounter for disinterested contemplation (Lang, 1997, page \n425) which seems the opposite of engaged realist imagery in photojournalism to which we \nturn after setting the scene for shipbreaking in the next section. \n \nPollution's Poster Child: abject labour, the beach and reportage \n \n\u2017It is one of the strangest, most striking and frightening industrial sites in the world. \nIt is large enough to be seen from space, but remains an open secret which few \nAmerican people have even heard of, let alone seen. If there is a hell on earth, this is \nit. In Bangladesh, 30,000 shipbreaking workers are dismantling some of the largest \ndecommissioned tanker ships in the world\u201420 stories high, 650 to over 1,000 feet \nlong, 95 to 164 feet wide, which have been run up on the beach in the Bay of \nBengal, not far from the city of Chittagong. (National Labor Committee 2009, page \n6) \n \nThe revelatory charge of images of ship breaking in the global south derives partly since it \nshould not occur there at all. International law prohibits the export of hazardous waste from \nthe developed world to less developed countries, and ships contain tonnes of hazardous \nwaste. And yet, 80% of ship breaking globally is conducted in South Asia on open beaches, \nprecisely due to these places of waste lacking environmental and labour regulation. The \nfinancial driver is clear when a ship sold to be broken in South Asia is worth around $300 per \nlight weight tone (i.e. its weight in metal) whereas the owner would have to pay to have it \nbroken in Europe or the USA. Partly this continued illegal trade is enabled by intermediaries \nexploiting flags of convenience, so there is a degree of legal uncertainty over the ownership \n 10 \nand origin of vessels, and partly the claim this is recycling materials, which is legally \nallowed.  \n \nThis paper focuses upon one of the main locations for ship breaking \u2013 Chittagong, in \nBangladesh which in 2008-09 processed around a third of the global total and whose beaches \nhave come to prominence through the work of a number of documentary photographers. The \nbeach has become an archetype for an industrial hell: \nAt low tide, the vast mud flat of the Bay of Bengal is almost apocalyptic. Unwanted \noil tankers, passenger liners and fishing boats dot the world\u2018s largest river delta like \nbeached leviathans, the monolithic steel forms turning coastal idyll into industrial \nwasteland. (Bell, 2008) \nThe ships are cut apart using winches and blow torches, largely through dirty manual labour \nby the more than 30,000 employed on the yards. The scrap is hauled from the beach to yards \n\u2013 themselves scarcely more than a few buildings on the shoreline, and sent to local rerolling \nmills. Using blow torches for hot cutting is extremely dangerous if there are any gases \ntrapped in old tankers \u2013 and old tankers have become the specialty of Bangladesh in a race to \nthe bottom of world labour and environmental standards (Sawyer 2001, page 548-9). It is thus \nall too common to hear the news that workers have died either through impact or explosion. \nThe investigative report by the US based NGO the National Labor Committee (2009), grimly \nentitled \u2017Where Ships and Workers Go to Die,\u2018 summarised the conflicting, yet uniformly \nbleak, estimates of between one worker dying every month and three workers dying every \nweek. And the deaths continue: this last Boxing day, the failure to effectively clean the tanks \nof the MS Agate prior to cutting led to an explosion that killed six workers, four dying at the \nscene then two more dying in hospital over the next two days (the last having suffered 80% \nburns). This story left room only for a footnote that in the same week five workers at another \n 11 \nyard were injured when an iron plate fell on them (Bangladesh Daily Star , December 27\nth\n \n2009 and January 1, 2010). These all too common, dramatic incidents overshadow the \ninsidious, yet probably equal, dangers that exposure to asbestos and many persistent organic \ntoxins pose for workers. As CBS News put it: \nYou can\u2018t really believe how bad it is here until you see it. It could be as close you \nwill get to hell on earth with the smoke, the fumes, the heat. The men who labor here \nare the wretched of the earth doing dirty dangerous work for little more than a dollar \na day. \nThe appalling environmental and labour conditions, coupled with its at best semi-legal status \nmade the ship breaking trade a target for groups such as Greenpeace who saw it: \nas an obvious violation [of prohibitions on international toxic dumping]: if the ships \nwere not themselves toxins, they were permeated with toxic materials, and were being \nsent to South Asia as a form of waste. Greenpeace was convinced that ships owned by \ncompanies based in the nations that had signed the [Basel waste] accord, no matter \nwhat flag those ships flew, were clearly banned from export. It was a good argument. \nMoreover, the shipping industry's counterargument -- that the ships went south as \nships, becoming waste only after hitting the beaches -- provided a nice piece of \ndouble talk that Greenpeace could hold up for public ridicule. And [the breaking \nbeach], with its filth and smoke, provided perfect panoramas to bring the point home. \nSo Greenpeace went to war.\u2018 (Langewiesche, 2000) \n \nShip breaking thus became the focus of high profile campaigns by NGOs. The breaking \nbeaches have become \u2017Pollution's Poster Child\u2018 (Langewiesche, 2000). The ships afford a \npowerful, affective combination of appeals to the negative aspects of globalization. They \nbring together a number of classic counter-narratives to globalization (Roe & van Eeten, \n 12 \n2004) \u2013 the overwhelming of local regulation by global flows, the environmental harm \nthrough capital accumulation, and the exploitation of labour. These counter narratives are \narticulated through a discourse that foregrounds visualization in extensively illustrated media. \nAs such NGO campaigns interrelate with the number of photographic studies of this industry \nand this particular site. In contrast with the similar breaking beaches at Alang (India), that \nwere closed to outsiders after NGO campaigns, the photojournalism group Panos \n(http:\/\/www.panos.org\/ss.asp?img=13) notes that \u2017Many of the best known names in \nphotojournalism have photographed the ship-breaking yards in Chittagong.\u2018 Perhaps first was \nSebasti\u00e3o Salgado in 1989, but the interest is ongoing through to the 2008 exhibition \u2017Steel \nbeaches\u2018 by Andrew Bell at the Australian National Maritime Museum. As Rebecca Solnit \ncomments, in making this unseen world, upon which our comfortable lives depend, visible \neven factual pictures are political (2007, page 136). \n \nDocumentary films have also picked upon Chittagong beach with Yasmine Kabir's \ndocumentary The Last Rites winning the Ram Bahadur Trophy at the South Asia Film \nFestival 2009 following Shaheen Dill-Riaz\u2018s film IronEaters on the same topic which won \nthe best documentary film award at the 2007 festival. In both cases film enables a different \npossibility for narrating the imagery with both tracing labour migration through workers\u2018 \nstories linking the beaches and origins of workers in Northern Bangladesh. The latter director \nhas commented that Salgado\u2018s work inspired them to address the topic \u2013 stressing the power \nof making this scene visible. \u2017The place where ships are dismantled is not far from my village \nhome. Access to the yards was strictly forbidden for anyone who didn\u2018t work there. But we \nheard lots of stories about the colossal ships and the serious industrial accidents. My decision \nto make a documentary on ship-breakers was triggered by Brazilian photographer Sebastiao \nSalgado\u2018s remarkable photos on the subject\u2018 (Answer at premiere of Ironeaters, Chittagong \n 13 \n26 Feb 2008). Photography has led the way in making Chittagong a site where the detritus of \nglobal consumerism becomes visible. \n \nThe ships and shore have become an effective set of icons for high profile campaigns that \nseek to use them to speak to the wider agenda of the environment, global responsibility and \ninequality. The contrast of the huge ships with the bodies of the workers is a repeated motif in \nthe campaigning literature. \nAt the yards all kinds of shipwrecks lie on the beach \u2026 Dozens of men twist their \nbodies in impossible angles to torch cut the steel into little pieces. It\u2018s hard physical, \ndangerous and unhealthy labour. They constantly breathe the toxic fumes that are \nreleased by the torch cutting. Steel plates and pieces fall off the ships and shears. \nNone of the workers wear helmets. Only one or two wear gloves or boots. \n(Greenpeace, 2003, page 7) \nThe bodies of the workers form the object of attention here \u2013 unsurprisingly given the \nnumber of deaths and evidently vulnerable bodies. Thus Greenpeace reports on ship breaking \nyards from Alang and Mumbai (India), Izmir (Turkey) and Chittagong (Bangladesh) work \nthrough a standard pattern of analysing the appalling environmental damage and working \nconditions before ending with calls for any toxic materials on board to be removed before \nships are sent for scrapping (Vardar & Harjono, 2002;  Greenpeace, 2003;  Kanthak & \nJayaraman, 2001). Given that for most ships it is unclear which, how much and where toxic \nmaterial may be located, the costs of such a clean up are often greater than the value of the \nship and then may well render it unseaworthy so it cannot sail to be broken. The calls thus \namount to a call for a total ban. The moral call here becomes an absolute one around abject \nlabour conditions, toxins and exploitation. The unanswered questions are how the ships \nwould be disposed of, what would become then of these Bangladeshi workers, the effects on \n 14 \nthe Bangladeshi economy which is deeply entwined with the products of shipbreaking \n(Gregson et al forthcoming) and whether a different politics, of engagement and upskilling, \nmight be possible. This campaigning literature parallels the scopic regime from \nphotographers who have sought out the landscape of these beaches as sites where the global \nflows of capital can be visualized through the degraded conditions of people and places, but \nin so doing risk picking out a frozen moment in global circulations. \n \nRealist visualities: landscapes of labour \n \nExamples of realist visualities framing Chittagong are to be found in the work of Sebasti\u00e3o \nSalgado, Brendan Corr and Sean Smith who in different ways share a commitment to \nevidence working conditions and lives. As Julian Stallabrass (1997, page 147) comments, \nSalgado\u2018s work \u2017organizes its visual material so as to give concrete form to circumstances \nwhich can only be known about through the study of, say, the economy\u2018 whilst also \nillustrating, in Lukacs\u2018 phrase, life as it actually appears. Others say it thus oscillates between \nsocial realism and \u2017magical realism\u2018 invoking the spiritual (Campbell 2003, page 75).  \n \nSalgado\u2018s (2005) collection Workers: an Archaeology of the Industrial Age documents the \nstate of labour around the globe. His work continues a preoccupation with enabling workers \nwho produce goods to become visible and also to return the gaze of the consumers. Salgado \naims for a photographic ethnography picturing lives from the inside (Campbell, 2003, page \n83). One of his chosen sites was the ship breaking beaches of Bangladesh. His account \nstresses the agency and action of the workers who \u2017run these ships onto the beach at high \nspeed; then they attack them from all sides, blow torches cut through its steelskin, giant \nhammers break up its iron and wood structure\u2026 Everything from that giant animal lying on \n 15 \nthe beach has its use. Iron and steel will be melted down and given new roles as utensils\u2018 \n(Salgado, 2005, page 14). In part then Salgado\u2018s is a restatement of the presence of labour, \nand the pictures are an assertion of these worlds of manual toil in an age that often claims to \nbe post-industrial; they are images out of time that depict labour conditions that many in the \nwest have consigned to history.  \n \nThe focus of his work is the doing of manual labour, though instead of looking to a bright \nfuture as with Lewis Hine\u2018s workers, where the heroic construction workers symbolically \ndominate their products, Salgado reworks the vision to suggest something more desperate on \nthe margins of global capital. Salgado takes the modernist style and inverts its narrative. So \nwhere modernism developed an industrial sublime that \u2017used to glorify leviathan industry and \noccasionally its workers, it is here turned to elegy\u2018 and we have \u2017masked workers, and fragile \nfigures pressed up against gigantic machinery; \u2026 all recast by Salgado in a period of decline\u2018 \n(Stallabrass, 1997, page 149). There is no vision of progress to either social reform or a bright \nnew technical future here. Indeed especially in the ship breaking pictures the sense of decline \nis manifest in \u2017dramatic images of strenuous labour, of mighty hammer blows struck and \ngreat weights borne, not to make some grand vessel, but to take one apart\u2018 (Stallabrass, 1997, \npage 150). These are not picturesque images of decay, but ones that emphasise the physical \ndismantling, and hacking apart of the ship. Like Hine\u2018s builders, labour on the Bangladeshi \nbeaches picks out the muscular and masculine in work. The workers are embodied as \u2017dark-\nskinned, no sign of excess fat, muscles developed by constant physical labour and, most \nfrequently, smiling. Many of the figures seem more akin to models that would adorn the \nadvertising of men\u2018s magazines than to images of poverty\u2018 (Cairns, 2007, page 267). Young \nmale flesh is here exoticised and staged for the appalled delectation of the viewer, with other \nrealist photographers alternating it with the injured, and damaged bodies resulting from the \n 16 \nappallingly risky conditions. The risk here is surely that instead of speaking of connections to \nwestern viewers\u2018 lives, the pictures may frame the workers as exotic others. The focus upon \nthe bodies may risk decentering the material, economic connections and causes. \n \nThe images convey \u2017a strong sense of human presence and activity, of physical strain and \nfatigue, of dust and sweat, which we can all understand by virtue of being human and having \nto work\u2018 (Stallabrass 1997 page 150). The vision is a Marxian humanism, calling us to \nempathise, speaking of similarity and potential solidarity. Such moments of poignancy recall \nthe punctum in Barthes, that offers moments of human identification (Olin, 2002). The \nBlakean visions of industry as hell are obvious referents but, often the fragility of human life \nappears in poignantly small touches \u2013 where lightly clad workers toil across the devastated \nbeach to bring a cable out to winch in part of a ship, their supervisor stands with a diminutive \numbrella as shade and inadequate, if welcome, shelter. The pictures emphasise the \ncamaraderie of labour but also its very precarious existence. Stallabrass argues there is an \ninvocation of religious imagery where: \nthese involuntary neophytes are sacrificed to the numerous deities -- commodities \nand corporations -- of the capitalist cosmos. In this sense, to present workers as \nbattling against forces beyond their control is to tell an uncomfortable truth. \nWhile humanity may be one, the gods, like those of the ancient world, are many \nand warring, and reckless in the use of their human charges (page 152) \nThe human figures are oppressed and outscaled by the huge materials -- in visions not of \nprogress or technological triumph, but capitalism as disaster. As time-images these are an \narchaeology of the contemporary ruins of capitalism. \n \n 17 \nA different emphasis but the same genre can be found with Brendan Corr whose photoessay \n\u2017End of the line\u2018 (2006) illustrates the powerful visual rhetoric that can be deployed in this \nway \u2013 focusing upon the labour process set against the scale of the ships. His work is \nregularly re-used in the press and by NGOs such as Environmental Law Alliance Worldwide \nwhen it celebrated a recent court victory reasserting environmental controls over the \nBangladeshi ship breaking industry (http:\/\/www.elaw.org\/news\/advocate\/2009-spring). His \nonline gallery shows 22 pictures taken on the Chittagong beaches, of which 18 are captioned \nwith references to the tasks and injuries suffered by \u2017salvage workers\u2018, and one more refers to \na mother and daughter depicted scavenging the cinders left by the cutting torches on the \nbeach. The work focuses not upon the connective flows of material from west to global south \nbut upon the vulnerable and overwhelmed bodies of the workers \u2013 such as in moving portraits \nof a worker scarred by hot material from cutting or with a cataract from lack of protection. \nEven in pictures that offer mid-range shots of the scene on the beach, revealing the jagged \nand strange outlines of half destroyed ships the captions emphasise the workers \u2013 one picture \nof a half dismantled ship is actually focused upon the diminutive figure of the worker atop it, \nand is captioned \u2017worker silhouetted\u2018. The dynamic of scale revolves around the bodies of the \nworkers so that the ships\u2018 bulk sets off the human fragility. Thus the picture captioned \n\u2017worker emerging from the hull of a supertanker\u2018 depicts a square access hole with a figure \nemerging \u2013 but the hole is set as the bottom tenth of the image, with the huge bulk of the \ncorroded metal of a ship\u2018s hull totally filling the rest of the frame, so the focusing worker \noccupies less than 5% of the image. A contrast might be the recent work of the local \nphotographer and National Geographic award winner Saiful Huq Omi (2009), schooled in \nphotojournalism after Salgado, which deliberately works to centre and humanize workers \nthrough named portraits, captioned with stories of horrific injuries, leaving the ships as \ndistant background.  \n 18 \n  \nSean Smith\u2018s pictures from Chittagong are closer to Omi\u2018s portraiture, with close ups of \nworkers at work. But the documentary is both personal and yet general. The particular \nworkers are the focus and yet they also become \u2017everyman.\u2018 The risky and dangerous work \nappears but it is the workers that are the focus. So a young cutter appears in full length \nportrait, where we do not see the actual work but are left to infer the lack of protective \nclothing and so forth through the incongruity of the soiled, cheap (Bangladeshi made) fashion \nclothes being worn (Figure 1). What comes across in the images is a materiality of labour \nprocess, where the workers are dirty, the place is dirty and the sense of the 45 degree heat is \npalpable. As a group of workers drag a cable across to a ship, we see their feet sink into the \nglutinous, contaminated beach (Figure 2). Sean Smith\u2018s sense of camaraderie and labour \noffers a vision that speaks more to the materiality of the beach as workplace than in the \nglobal waste flows of ships. The visualities here of labour and vulnerable bodies in these \nphoto-documentaries chime with the mobilization of ship breaking in NGO politics. The \nrealist vision of these photographers, as in Salgado\u2018s almost typological framing, risks though \ndepicting the workers as living in a remote and alien world, materially unconnected to our \nown.  \n \nFIGURES 1& 2 ROUND HERE \n \nResidual landscapes: Industrial Ruins and Time Images \n \nAs Cairns notes, many photographic works on the Chittagong beaches are more ambivalent \nthan disaster documents with pictures showing the danger and contamination but also \u2017the \nsculptural beauty of the ships, both as grand machines when first grounded and as skeletal \nremains during the latter stages of their dismantling\u2018 (Cairns, 2007, page 267, see figure 3). \n 19 \nThe paper turns to that focus upon abject materials here. Photography that speaks to the \nmateriality of waste and its connection with our consumer society has in some cases focused \nupon the sheer quantity, indeed enumeration of the materials, forming a numerical sublime. \nThis paper instead looks at Edward Burtynsky who instead includes both the scale of \nprocessed but also the awful scope and power those forces for a dynamic sublime. \nBurtynsky\u2018s work on industrially altered landscapes for the last 30 years offers a rich sense of \nthe material recomposition of wastes. Over that period his corpus of work extols the material \ncounterpoint of urbanisation and industrialization \u2013 looking at the degraded environment as \nthe negative image of cities and factories. His work focuses upon the sources and destinations \nof the material flows of, increasingly globalised, industrialisation. In this sense he works with \nwhat he calls the residual landscape of the consequences of capitalism.  \n \nFIGURE 3 ROUND HERE \n \nHis recent work picks out different points in the global circulation of commodities, so that he \noffers \u2017a chronicle of rarely seen points in the biography of everyday things and work \nenvironments. Presented as a kind of material culture of globalization\u2018 (Campbell, 2008, page \n40). As Solnit (2007, page 168) argues, this offers a \u2017truly ecological photography\u2026 tracing \nthe life of a commodity all the way from extraction to disposal.\u2018 He maintains a studied \nambiguity, aesthetic and ideological, about the epic scale and grandeur of industry and sites \nof extraction as an industrial sublime. But equally there is a terror in his sublime \u2013 these are \ntruly awful scenes. He plays on both the grandeur and the horror. \u2017My images borderline the \nsurreal and become disarming -- because they leave the viewer to wander between \nrecognizable and unfamiliar territories\u2018 (in Campbell 2008, page 42). Burtynsky plays around \nthe balance between questions of beauty (the awe) and the questions of ethics (the awful) as \n 20 \nCammaer (2009, page 121-22) puts it, with his painterly concern for composition jarring with \nthe \u2017more realist sense of gigantic damage done to nature by worldwide industrialization, and \nthe devastating ecological and social consequences of globalization.\u2018 The debt owed to the \nindustrial landscape sublime in painting is clear in both content (Haworth-Booth, 2003) but \nalso in the intent to slow viewing from the snapshot to contemplation (Burtynsky, 2003, page \n48).  \n \nThis is not expos\u00e9 or reportage. Rather the power of the images comes from their ambiguity \nand lack of didacticism, which leads to the experiential \u2017horror\u2018 of encountering the \u2017detritus \nof our existence\u2018 in what initially appears to be abstract painting (Bozak, 2008\/2009, page \n69). Burtynsky disavows an intent to editorialise about what is right and wrong, being more \ndetermined to leave the pictures open to multiple readings in different registers \u2013 aesthetic, \npolitical, ecological, technological and more (Torosian, 2003, page 49).  \n\u2017To me, what is interesting as an artist, or mediator, is to reconnect to the sources \nof our lifestyle, to find a way to capture the immensity of scale and activity there, \nbut not in what most think of as a purely \u2015documentary\u2016 fashion [about a specific \nexample but choosing one] that somehow has a special quality that allows me as a \nphotographer to transform it into something that goes well beyond the thing itself.\u2018 \n(Burtynsky cited in Campbell, 2008, page 42) \nThe pictures focus less upon indexical truth claims (that this happened there), but iconic \nsymbols (the process at large). The referent\u2018s hold on the pictures is weakened in order to \nenhance the aesthetic quality (Cammaer, 2009, page 122). This is not just about making the \npictures beautiful. Rather Burtynsky uses form to connect with the larger and abstract, both \nquantitatively and conceptually (Figure 4). This is partly done by reproducing the pictures at \nlarge scale, both to stage the scale of the process but also allow the details such as the cutter \n 21 \nto become apparent, yet remain minute. So his work is marked out by use of large format \ncameras and large format pictures with static and formally composed subjects. This affects \nhis photographic practice and vision, as he uses a: \n8x10 large-format \"bellows\" camera\u2026 Burtynsky has to use a tripod to stabilize the \ncamera; a black focusing cloth is also necessary (to darken the image reflected on the \ncamera's exposed ground glass plate while the practitioner adjusts focus). The \nsymbolic logic of this artistic practice -- the artist stooped beneath the black shroud, \nfinger poised on the cable release button, faithful to an old-fashioned mode of \nphotography -- suggests a defiance of the reckless forward momentum of \nindustrialization. (Bozak, 2008\/2009, page 71)  \nSo watching him work on Chittagong beach standing on the contaminated sands, with camera \nhood over head, he appears like some colonial throwback. It evokes \u2017the expeditionary \nimages of ancient monuments in exotic lands taken by nineteenth century photographers\u2018 \n(Baker, 2003, page 51). Like colonial imagery what appears are impersonal documents and \ntableau denuded of their geographical specificity. But rather than repress the connections of \nviewer and viewed, as colonial photography did, here the images serve to restage the \nrepression of global connections.  \n \nThe detachment allows an aestheticisation and denies an overt critical positioning that can be \ntroubling in the face of industrial civilization\u2018s environmental incursions (Bozak, 2008\/2009). \nIt is telling that in Jennifer Baichwal\u2018s documentary on Burtynsky, the film oscillates \nbetween trying to emulate the open spectator position encouraged by the pictures and \nproviding narration to both picturing and the pictured that is otherwise absent (Cammaer, \n2009). Baichwal suggested that the film did \u2017what [the images] could not do, \u2015which was to \nfollow the narratives that exist in all the photographs and be able to focus on the detail that \n 22 \nmakes up that picture,\u2016 the detail of human lives\u2018 (in Bozak, 2008\/2009, page 68), like Dill-\nRiaz\u2018s documentary, the individual stories are more pronounced than the more open visual \nimpact of the still pictures. The ambiguous detail of the half seen worker, or ladder leaning \nagainst a ship, is replaced by more filled out human stories. \n \nBurtynsky\u2018s pictures of industrial ruins figure materiality through their topic, composition \nand ontology. First, the topic is material transformations, landscapes and processes \u2013 all be \nthat in a negative sense for the \u2017depletion zone\u2018 (Zehle, 2008) of extractive industries. The \nstudied ambiguity addresses altered nature without immediately judging it against an \naesthetic standard of pristine nature but also without invoking the picturesque focus upon the \nirregular and unplanned (Ackerman, 2003). There is here a dynamic sublime about the power \nof industrial materiality. Second, the composition has a democratic distribution of light and \nspace (Burtynsky, 2003, page 52;  Baker, 2003) that moves it away from an anthropocentric \nperspective. The pictures often disorient senses of scale and dislocate any human focal point. \nThe point of view creates, in Deleuze\u2018s terms, a nomadic nomos which distributes materials \nacross a space without precise limits rather than centred Aristotelian space (Olkowski, 1997, \npage 478). The disorientating effect means \u2017they seem almost allegorical, ant like men \nfragmenting the colossi that are the only relief in that vast, flat expanse\u2018 (Solnit, 2007, page \n138). For instance, Shipbreaking #8 (Figure 5) shows an almost classical landscape \ncomposition with horizon setting off a water edged scene and choreographed, toting a thick \nrope that begins and ends outside the picture frame\u2018 (Diehl, 2006, page 121). This does not \nforeground the labour process nor do the tiny human figures focus these pictures. \u2017The people \nin these images are there only to \u2015remind us of their insignificance.\u2016 \u2026 by rendering people \nalmost as abstract figures, [Burtynsky] emphasizes the dehumanizing dimensions of \nindustrialization\u2018 (Bozak, 2008\/2009, page 68).  \n 23 \n \nHowever at a third level the pictures also have a specific ontology of materiality. These \nimages attend to the actual material recomposition of the ships on the beaches of Chittagong, \nand the very substance of the wastes. They speak to material changes and transformation \noffering not just movement-images of globalization but time-images of the life of things \n(Deleuze, 1989). To make an obvious but helpful contrast then they speak to waste not \nthrough organic decay but physical entropy (see Figure 3). Thus, they do not speak to the \ncyclical time found in work on organic waste invoke decay and rebirth (Pauli, 2003a, page \n24). In Chittagong #8 as Diehl (2006, page 121)  (Figure 5) suggests instead \u2017the massive \nodd-shaped sculptural elements in this play of light and shadow suggest the ruins of an \nancient metropolis unknown to Westerners.\u2018 \n \nFIGURE 5 ROUND HERE \n \nConclusions \n \nShip breaking offers both a movement-image and a time-image for global capitalism. It \nspeaks to a world in flow, as an object that is mobile, bound to our consumer society and \nwhose wasting is expelled from the body social. As such it evokes an affective appeal in \nmelancholy registers regarding the \u2017death\u2018 of ships. The temporality we might look to is \nagain then that of the ruin in that they are evocative of a lost order. At one level the aesthetic \nregister one might expect is that of the melancholy picturesque \u2013 that combination of sadness \nyet also reflection (Brady & Haapala, 2003) -- either about the environmental damage done, \nor the death of the great ships. While Burtynksy has said he is interested in the \u2017ruins of our \nsociety\u2018 as both melancholy and monumental (Zehle, 2008, page 111), his shipbreaking \n 24 \npictures do not lend themselves to that melancholy reflective moment so easily. There are \nsome intriguing parallels with the temporalities of Turner\u2018s The Fighting Temeraire (1838) \nshowing a once proud ship tugged away to be dismantled (Diehl, 2006, page 121 ; Pauli, \n2003b, page 24) but more with Rain, Steam and Speed (1844) as a depiction of industrial \nprocess in motion as a time-image of industrial society. While both Turner and Burtynsky \ndepict people lost in their environment with those in command nowhere in evidence, Turner \nwas documenting the birth of the industrial world, Burtynsky shares with Salgado a more \nelegiac sense of the limits of that process, depicting the timespaces of creative destruction. \nThe slowness and vastness of Burynsky\u2018s images offer a \u2017figure of temporalization\u2018 that \n\u2017reverse time\u2018s subordination to movement and show time for itself\u2018 (Deleuze 1989, pages \n109-110). So Burtynsky\u2018s: \n\u2015Shipbreaking\u2016 photographs, like all his works, appear to us as images of the end of \ntime. The abandoned mines and quarries, the piles of discarded tires, the endless \nfields of oil derricks, the huge monoliths of retired tankers show how our attempts at \nindustrial \u2015progress\u2016 often leave a residue of destruction. Nevertheless there is \nsomething uncannily beautiful and breath taking in the very expansiveness of these \nimages \u2013 it is as if the vastness of their perspective somehow opens onto the longer \nview of things.\u2018 (Pauli, 2003b, page 33) \nThe sense of both the monumental and loss of control then creates an industrial landscape \nsublime (Haworth-Booth, 2003) that speaks to both kinds of Kant\u2018s sublime \u2013 the \nmathematical and the dynamic. But this is an altered nature (Brady 2008, page 8). Now in \nconfronting not the natural but the human altered environment Burtynsky\u2018s work marks a \nself-conscious shift from linking the natural with the sublime.  \n  \n 25 \nMore especially the use of the imagery of ship destruction, in its dirty, destructive depravity \nacts as a shocking reminder of our inescapable connections to material flows and \ntransformations. The focus on shipbreaking by NGOs is driven by the appalling labour \ncondition and environmental damage through the process, but also the affective charge such \nimages enable. The Chittagong beaches become icons, circulating a counter discourse of anti-\nglobalisation and contesting the logics of capital. They represent the nadir of globalization: \n\u2017These places look inhuman for their scale and for their poisons and hazards, but \nthey are the landscapes on which most humans now depend. It may be industrial \ncivilization is predicated on blindness and alienation, on not knowing \u2026 [what \nmakes] your pleasant first world urban\/suburban existence impossible, for that \nknowledge might at least make that existence a little less pleasant\u2018 (Solnit 2007, \npage 135) \n \nHowever while the texts of the various NGO reports tend to point the reader towards a \nsingular interpretation grounded in assumed common values about \u2015environmentalism\u2016 and \n\u2015exploitation\u2016 the photographic representation of ship breaking can stimulate conflicting \nresponses with senses of beauty, and even hope in the work (Cairns, 2007, page 275). In the \nwork of Smith or Salgado the dismantling here offers more of a punctum into the process of \ncapitalism. Their humanistic and documentary imperatives contrast with the aesthetically \nmodified sublime or ruinous sense of the material object in Burtynsky which emphasise \nmateriality and destruction.  \n \nBurtynsky\u2018s images mobilise an industrial sublime, that brings the materiality and \ntransformative processes to the fore. It therefore both fits and does not fit the classic sublime. \nAs with Kant\u2018s original it demands a detached viewing and thus a detached observer. As such \n 26 \nit risks \u2017a convenient formalism that engenders the politics of quietism, one might, in the \nsense of a \u2017political\u2018 sublime, see also a withdrawal that in turn makes visible a space of \nwitnessing that is not coincident with a particular form of agency\u2018 (Zehle, 2008, page 113). \nThere is little in this treatment to intimate that the small sometimes incidental figures are \npoorly paid laborers engaged in a dangerous occupation (Diehl, 2006, page 121). In that \nsense it speaks to a problematically cosmopolitan subject, a citizen of the world, a privileged \nviewer, who floats free of the graft and struggles depicted. However, it also reminds us of \nmaterial transformation as a necessary and ongoing part of our world, intrinsically linked to \nglobal consumption. Unlike much documentary work it retains an attachment to the \nsensuality of the world (Solnit, 2007, page 139). Materiality here is the abject underbelly of \nglobal industry, its waste refound and refigured. By creating a pause for reflection, in a \nclassic aesthetic maneuver, it opens the possibility for our discomfort as well as engagement. \nBurtynsky has said one reason for the large scale of his pictures is to let those details draw the \nviewer in. The human detail is the punctum, an absence marking presence, demanding \nattention (Olin, 2002, page 110). The workers are not looking back at us, rather our gaze is \nheld by the ruination of the material. In decentering the ethnographic lens on remote and \nabject labour, do we risk the erasure of workers under the metaphor of material destruction? \nDoes the entropic time-image, and the allusion to sublime forces naturalise the process? This \npaper suggests that may be a risk worth taking if the allusive, diminutive figures restage \nglobally abject labour\u2018s relation to globally abject waste. \n \n \n \n \nAcknowledgements \n 27 \nThe work for this paper was supported by the ESRC grant \u2017The Waste of the World\u2018 (RES-\n060-23-0007).
