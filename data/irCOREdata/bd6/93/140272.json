This exploratory study seeks to provide a \nqualitative exposition of the specific factors influencing the adoption of consortium-owned B2B e-\nmarketplaces. The study is based upon case studies of twelve companies trading through three \ndifferent consortium B2B e-marketplaces. Twenty-six specific factors are identified and their \nimpact on adoption is discussed. The identification of a significant number of factors specific to this \ndomain provides real meaning and depth to those interested in the future of e-marketplaces. In \nparticular, the factors identified provide those that operate such e-marketplaces with a detailed and \nactionable understanding of the issues they should address in order to survive, and provide users or \npotential users of consortium marketplaces with a practical framework with which to assess \nindividual marketplaces. The factors can also form the basis of future studies of other types of \nmarketplaces and of quantitative studies of adoption. \n \nKEYWORDS: electronic marketplaces, B2B e-commerce, adoption, diffusion of innovation, case \nstudies \n \nTHE ADOPTION OF CONSORTIUM B2B E-MARKETPLACES: \nAN EXPLORATORY STUDY \n \nINTRODUCTION \nBusiness to business (B2B) electronic marketplaces, or e-marketplaces, have been in existence for \nover a decade, in which time they have been used to trade a wide range of goods. The development \nof the Internet caused heightened interest in this type of inter-organisational system (Kaplan and \nSawhney, 2000), and the number of new e-marketplaces grew rapidly in 1999 and 2000. By 2001, \nLaseter et al. (2001) identified 2,233 e-marketplaces. This contrasts starkly with the 750 active e-\nmarketplaces registered on the directory of trade organisation eMarket Services in mid 2006. Many \nearly e-marketplaces failed, high-profile casualties including Chemdex, MetalSpectrum, GoFish \nand E-Chemicals (Miller, 2001; Karpinski, 2001). More recently even the best-known marketplace, \nCovisint, has experienced difficulties (Arbin and Essler, 2005), having evolved from a collaborative \nventure established by leading automotive companies such as Ford, GM and Daimler-Chrysler, to \none that by 2006 was independent of the automotive industry (in terms of its ownership) and that \noffered services to healthcare companies.  \n \nThese failures seem to be mirrored in relatively low levels of adoption, though quantitative data is \npatchy. Research by the European Commission (2004) found that across multiple industries, on \naverage 11% of organisations used electronic marketplaces for at least part of their trading. The \nsectors with the highest level of adoption were transport and equipment, with 32% and 28% of \norganisations adopting respectively. Textiles and healthcare were the lowest with 4% and 5% \nadoption rates. A number of specific marketplaces are thriving, however: for example, SupplyOn, \nan e-marketplace in the automotive sector, became profitable in 2003 with revenues of 18 million \nEuros; and in early 2005, Exostar, an e-marketplace in the aerospace industry, was supporting over \n20,000 companies and conducting over 700,000 transactions every month, after making its first \noperating profit in 2003.  \n  \nThere has been much speculation as to why adoption of e-marketplaces has seemed relatively slow. \nWise and Morrison (2000) attributed the \u201csparse transaction volumes\u201d and \u201clow levels of revenue\u201d \nto the emphasis in e-marketplace functionality on competitive bidding and on helping buyers find \n 1\nnew suppliers. They believed that this caused marketplaces to fail to attract sellers, leading to low \nlevels of transactions, and thus of revenue. Other authors have cited insufficiently developed \nstandards (Albrecht et al., 2005); the characteristics of the particular vertical market (Yadav and \nVaradarajan, 2005); and a lack of trust between buyers and suppliers (Ratnasingam and Pavlou, \n2005). There has been little systematic study, though, of this mismatch between early expectations \nand the experience to date. This leaves researchers and practitioners alike unsure as to how \nimportant the e-marketplace will become to business-to-business relationships, and unclear on how \nthey can evaluate whether a given marketplace will flourish.  \n \nThis paper therefore reports on an exploratory qualitative study that identifies factors influencing \nthe adoption of B2B e-marketplaces. Our focus is on consortium marketplaces as these have been \nhypothesised as most likely to be sustainable (Devine et al., 2001). Our method involves twenty-\nfive interviews with twelve organisations that trade through three B2B e-marketplaces as well as \nwith managers within the marketplace organisations themselves. We start with five variable groups \nderived from the work of Rogers (2003) and others which have been found to influence adoption \nacross a wide range of innovations. We identify twenty-six sub-factors of these five variable groups \nthat give specific meaning and depth to the variable groups within this domain. We also report on \nthe extent to which these sub-factors influence adoption within the sample, and discuss some of the \nrespects in which they appear to interact. This identification of the sub-factors specific to this \ndomain may assist those that operate consortium e-marketplaces through a detailed and actionable \nunderstanding of the issues they should address in order to survive. Similarly, it provides users or \npotential users of such marketplaces with a practical framework with which to assess individual \nmarketplaces and could form the basis of similar studies of other types of B2B e-marketplaces. \n \nThe paper begins with a concise literature review on e-marketplaces and on diffusion of innovation \ntheory. After reporting the method and specific sub-factors identified by the study, a broader \ndiscussion of how the cases undertaken relate to extant literature and the additional insights that this \nprovides for the adoption of e-marketplaces is presented. Finally, implications for researchers and \npractitioners are drawn. \n \n 2\nE-MARKETPLACES: DEFINITIONS, CATEGORISATIONS AND ADOPTION \nIn this section we will present a definition of e-marketplaces that appears to be gaining acceptance \nin the literature, discuss classifications of e-marketplaces and consider the impact of the use of e-\nmarketplaces on organisations relative to other forms of trading. \n \nIt will often require a number of years for the definition of a new phenomenon to be generally \naccepted by those involved in the domain. Consistent with this, various definitions of e-\nmarketplaces have been proposed, many of which have required revision as the technology on \nwhich the marketplaces are based and the services they offer have evolved (e.g. Bakos, 1991; \nStrader and Shaw, 1997). We adopt as our working definition that of Howard et al. (2006 p.53), \nwho suggest that consensus may be building around a definition taken directly from earlier studies \nin this domain as follows: \u2018web-based systems that link multiple businesses together for the \npurposes of trading or collaboration\u2019.  \n \nLe (2005) provides a comprehensive set of e-marketplace classifications. One basis of classification \nhe includes and which is frequently referred to in the domain is the number of owners and their role \nin the marketplace (Krammer et al., 2001; Karpinski, 2001). Three classes of marketplace \nownership are commonly identified. Firstly, third party or public marketplaces are owned and \noperated by one or more independent third parties. Partsbase is an example of this type of \nmarketplace, helping its 16,000 users in the global aerospace and defence industry to source airline \nparts. Secondly, consortium marketplaces are formed by a collaboration of firms that also \nparticipate in the marketplace either as buyers or suppliers (Devine et al., 2001). An example is \nElemica in the chemical industry. Founded by twenty-two industry participants, it offers services in \nthe area of transport management, supply chain planning and procurement. Thirdly, a private \nmarketplace is an electronic network formed by a single company to trade with its customers, its \nsuppliers or both (Hoffman et al., 2002). VW Group Supply provides an example, being established \nas a private marketplace for Volkswagen to integrate with its suppliers, facilitating inter-\norganisational processes in the areas of procurement, supply chain management and quality \nmanagement. It has been suggested that the ownership model of an electronic marketplace will \nimpact its ability to attract users and hence its sustainability (Ordanini et al., 2004; Milliou and \nPetrakis, 2004). Consortium marketplaces were identified as most likely to be sustainable (Devine \net al., 2001), as the founders can introduce their own customers and suppliers to the marketplace, \nhelping the marketplace establish a viable level of transactions \u2013 a ready source of buyers and \n 3\nsuppliers not available to third party marketplaces. Additionally, and in contrast to a private \nmarketplace, a consortium marketplace by definition is open to a number of buyers and suppliers in \nthe industry, if not all, increasing the likelihood of participation and use. Whilst some consortium \nmarketplaces despite these favourable characteristics have not proved sustainable (Arbin and \nEssler, 2005), consortium marketplaces have tended to fare better than the other ownership models \n(Le, 2005). \n \nAnother means of categorising e-marketplaces is on the basis on functionality. Some authors extend \nthe view of e-marketplaces beyond the core procurement process to areas such as collaborative \nproject management (Dai and Kauffman, 2002), design collaboration (Grieger, 2004) and supply \nchain planning (Rudberg et al., 2002).  \n \nWe now turn to issues that are likely to influence the adoption and continued use of e-marketplaces. \nIn a theoretical study, Ratnasingam et al. (2005) identify antecedents to the adoption of e-\nmarketplaces in a given industry as: ease of IT connectivity, widely adopted IT standards, \nacceptable security levels and uniform product descriptions. These are all technical in nature. The \nstudy of e-marketplace adoption in the cotton industry by O\u2019Reilly and Finnegan (2005) suggests \nthat these technical aspects are complemented by economic and social factors. In particular, they \nfind that e-marketplace adoption is dependent upon organisational fit, \u2018value added\u2019 and trust. An \nownership and governance structure that engenders trust is also identified as important in attracting \na critical mass of users by Gengatharen and Standing (2005) in their study of the adoption of \nregional e-marketplaces by SMEs. \n \nIn their study of e-marketplaces in the automotive sector, Howard et al. (2006) identify a number of \nbarriers to the adoption of e-marketplaces - factors that are likely to dissuade organisations from \ntaking the initial decision to adopt a marketplace. These include at the industry level, the \ncompetitive nature of the industry and supplier resistance, and at the firm level, legacy IT systems \nand limited e-leadership skills. These barriers are consistent with Arbin and Essler\u2019s (2005) study \nof the e-marketplace Covisint, which found it had \u2018several problems: lack of incentives for \nsuppliers to join, lack of participating organisations on the suppliers\u2019 side and an overall inability \nto balance the interests of and objectives of the actors involved\u2019. \n \n 4\nHoward et al.\u2019s (2006) study also provides evidence of the benefits that have been realised by \norganisations using e-marketplaces which, if well communicated, might provide strong incentives \nfor other organisations to adopt. These include reductions in transaction costs, improved planning \nand improved audit of capability. In addition to these benefits, which were largely expected, the \nparticipating organisations also reported a number of unexpected benefits, including the ability to \ndevelop standard processes with trading partners and, in certain cases, improved supplier \ncommunication. However some disbenefits, such as poor return on capital from e-marketplace \ninvestments and the possibility of buyer-supplier mistrust, were also identified.  \n \nExtant studies, which have tended to be undertaken in the context of a single industry, therefore \nsuggest that there is a complex mixture of antecedents to adoption, barriers and benefits. An \nappropriate theoretical basis for combining these in order to understand what causes an e-\nmarketplace to be adopted is to view the e-marketplace as an innovation, and therefore to ground \nthe study in the literature on how innovations spread or diffuse, which we turn to now. \nTHE DIFFUSION OF INNOVATIONS  \nZaltman (1973) defines an innovation as being \u201cany idea, practice or material artefact perceived to \nbe new by the relevant unit of adoption\u201d, and Kanter (1985) as \u201cthe generation, acceptance and \nimplementation of new ideas, processes, products or services\u201d. Innovation has been the subject of a \nvast number of academic studies. These have focused on topics such as the factors that determine \nthe success of innovation projects (Cooper, 1980; Cooper and Kleinschmidt, 1987), types of \ninnovation (Clarke and Staunton, 1993; Damanpour, 1990), innovative environments and cultures \n(Ekvall, 1983; Cooper, 1980), and the role of leadership (Peters and Waterman, 1982). The key \ntheme in the innovation literature of interest here, though, is the study of factors affecting the \nadoption or diffusion of an innovation. Rogers (2003) defines the diffusion of innovation as: \u201cthe \nprocess by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the \nmembers of a social system\u201d.  \n \nBased on studies ranging from farming practices to the spread of religions, Rogers (2003 p221) \ndescribes a generic set of five variable groups affecting adoption. These are: the perceived \nattributes of the innovation, the type of innovation decision, the communication channels used, the \nnature of the social system and the extent of change agents\u2019 promotion systems. Whilst Rogers\u2019s \n(1995) work on the attributes of innovations that influence diffusion is well known and has formed \n 5\nthe basis of numerous studies, the other four variable groups have not been widely explored. Our \nreview of academic papers across all areas of management published since the 2003 edition of \nRogers\u2019s book (Rogers, 2003) identified 32 papers using Rogers\u2019s diffusion of innovation as the \nbasis of their studies.  Of these only one, Cheng et al. (2004)\u2019s study of online gaming in Taiwan, \nexplored the four variable groups that Rogers\u2019s identifies in addition to the attributes of the \ninnovation. Whilst the consumer focus of Cheng et al.\u2019s study makes it difficult to translate their \nfindings to the B2B domain, it is interesting to note that they confirmed the influence of \ncommunication channels, promotion systems and the nature of the social system. This study \ntherefore represents to our knowledge one of the earlier studies to make use of what we term \nRogers\u2019s wider diffusion of innovation framework.  \n \nGiven the continuing focus in current research on the attributes of the innovation, then, it is worth \nconsidering this particular aspect of diffusion further. Rogers divides the attributes of the \ninnovation into five broad factors: relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability and \nobservability (see Table 1). Rogers (2003) observes that the relative importance of these factors \nmay vary in any given domain, and furthermore that their detailed meaning will vary across \ndifferent contexts, and therefore that exploratory qualitative work is important in new domains. \nPerceived risk has also been identified as a potential factor influencing adoption of IT-related \ninnovations and more broadly (Eastin, 2002; Duguay et al., 2003), and we include consideration of \nthis factor in this study, and hence include it in Table 1. \n \n[Take in Table 1 about here.] \n \nA review of 75 studies across numerous domains by Tornatzky and Klein (1982) gave weight to \nRogers\u2019s innovation attributes, finding that these generic factors were usually, although not always \nconsistently, related to adoption (in a positive direction, except for complexity which was \nnegatively related as one would expect). Rogers himself (2003) demonstrates the applicability of \nthis theory to Internet based technologies through examples of Internet usage diffusion by \nindividual users, free email services, computer viruses and e-commerce. However, no previous \nstudies are known which comprehensively apply diffusion of innovation theory to e-marketplace \nadoption specifically. Partial applications include Hadaya\u2019s (2006) study of the future use of e-\nmarketplaces by Canadian firms, Gupta et al\u2019s (2005) study that identified the role of the network \nchampion in the diffusion process, and Banerjee and Ma (2002) who developed a theoretical model \n 6\nof electronic marketplaces based on extant literature and a pilot study. Perhaps closest to the e-\nmarketplace domain are applications of the theory to other areas of B2B e-commerce such as He et \nal.\u2019s (2006) study of online payment by Chinese organisations, Taylor and Perry\u2019s (2005) study of \nthe use of the internet for corporate communications and Tung and Rieck\u2019s (2005) study of the \nadoption of electronic government services by organisations.  \n \nIn summary, extant literature suggests that diffusion of innovation theory provides a useful \nframework within which to consider the adoption of e-marketplaces. However, mindful of Rogers\u2019s \nwarning (Rogers, 2003) not to adopt measures developed for other innovations, the objective of this \nstudy is: to provide a qualitative exposition of the specific factors influencing the adoption of \nconsortium B2B e-marketplaces. \n \nBACKGROUND TO E-MARKETPLACES STUDIED \nThe study was based upon case studies of three consortium marketplaces as summarised in Table 2. \nA brief introduction to these marketplaces is provided here, before we turn to our method in detail. \n \n[Take in Table 2 about here.] \n \nAutomotive \u2013 SupplyOn \nA consortium of automotive tier 1 suppliers (the suppliers who sell major car components directly \nto the car manufacturers) including Bosch and Siemens founded SupplyOn in the summer of 2000. \nSupplyOn positioned itself to link tier 1 with tier 2 suppliers (those selling to the tier 1 suppliers) \nand downward through the supply chain. This contrasts with Covisint, a marketplace formed by \nseveral OEMs (car manufacturers) to link with their tier 1 suppliers. Following the problems of \nCovisint in 2004, SupplyOn has begun to work with BMW and target other OEMs. SupplyOn has \noffices in Germany, France and the US, but to date 60% of the companies using the marketplace are \nfrom Germany and a further 21% from the rest of Europe \u2013 a concentration that the organisation is \nworking to redress. Its vision is to offer services that address three principal inter-organisational \nactivities: sourcing; supply chain management; and collaborative product development.  \n \nHealthcare \u2013 The Global Healthcare Exchange (GHX) \nThe Global Healthcare Exchange is a US based company that was established in March 2000 by 16 \nleading suppliers of medical products such as Johnson and Johnson and GE Medical Systems. \n 7\nThese organisations have invested approximately 240 million Euros to date to establish the e-\nmarketplace. GHX offers three services: connectivity between itself and buyers and suppliers, a \nproduct catalogue, and a platform that allows for the exchange of procurement information such as \npurchase orders, dispatch notification and invoices. Prices are not listed on the e-marketplace itself, \nas the supply-side founders understandably wish to emphasise process efficiencies rather than price \ncomparisons. \n \nUtilities \u2013 Eutilia  \nEutilia, an electronic marketplace for the utilities sector, was founded in March 2001. The founding \ncompanies, which are all European, include EdF, Endesa, National Grid, Scottish Power and United \nUtilities. All these companies are under continual pressure from capital markets, customers and the \nregulators to reduce their costs and prices. In response to these pressures, Eutilia offers services \nfocused on improving the performance of the procurement function within buying organisations, \nand the marketing and sales function within supplying ones. The services offered are in the areas of \nstrategic sourcing tools, electronic tendering and auctions, and a transaction platform. \nMETHOD \nWhilst the objective of the study to identify specific examples of the general factors identified in \nRogers\u2019s existing framework may suggest a confirmatory research approach, the fact that these \nfactors have not previously been identified for the e-marketplace domain necessitates an \nexploratory approach.  \n \nAs shown in Table 2 and outlined in the previous section, a set of three consortium e-marketplaces \nwas selected using the following criteria: \n1. The chosen e-marketplaces should offer services that went beyond basic procurement \nactivities (i.e. the purchase-to-pay process) and include one or more wider areas of \nfunctionality such as supplier management, inventory management, catalogue management, \ndemand planning and collaborative new product development. This criterion was introduced \nas e-marketplaces that offer more advanced services reflect more accurately the supply \nchain management practices of contemporary organisations and were expected to be more \nsustainable (Laseter et al., 2001; Ganesh and Madanmoham, 2004).  \n2.  In order to increase the generalisability of the study, the e-marketplaces were drawn from \ndifferent industry sectors.  \n 8\n3. Whilst all e-marketplaces studied would be of the consortium type, marketplaces with a \nvariation in the ownership of those consortia - buyer-owned versus supplier-owned - were \nselected in order to explore whether this factor influences adoption. For example, it seemed \nplausible that ownership by suppliers, as in the case of GHX, may limit the participation of \nother suppliers and hence the overall adoption of the marketplace. \n \nFrom this initial screening, the three e-marketplaces described in the previous section were \napproached for access; all agreed.  \n \nAn approach to qualitative data analysis originally proposed by Znaniecki (1934) was chosen due to \nit being a well-accepted method of eliciting and combining findings across multiple case studies \n(Gill and Johnson, 1991; Bansall and Roth 2000; Lapointe and Rivard 2005). In brief, the method \ninvolves formulating a hypothesis; comparing the hypothesis against the first case; if it does not fit, \nreformulating the hypothesis so as to be consistent with the data in the first case; comparing the \nrevised hypothesis against the second case; and so on. According to Cressey (1950, 1953), an \nimportant early developer of the approach, \u201cpractical certainty may be attained after a small \nnumber of cases, but a single negative case requires a reformulation\u2026the procedure continues \nuntil a universal relationship is established\u201d. \n \nIn the context of this study, this method was operationalised in the following way. The unit of \nanalysis was the e-marketplace as an innovative intervention in the industry\u2019s buyer-supplier \nrelationships. Hence for each e-marketplace, two buyer organisations and two supplier \norganisations were studied. The decision to study two buying and two supplying organisations for \neach marketplace allowed a balance between uncovering consistent and differing views across \norganisations, whilst being able to study each organisation\u2019s use of the marketplace in some depth, \nfor example by interviewing multiple staff within a single organisation. Interviews were held with \nexecutives responsible for supply chain management within buyer organisations, and those \nresponsible for sales and customer service within supplier organisations. In all, twenty-five semi-\nstructured interviews were conducted with twenty-seven managers from fifteen organisations, \nincluding the three marketplaces themselves. These interviews were conducted in UK (12), \nGermany (11) and The Netherlands (4). Of the interviewees, one was a CEO, one a Chairman, \nseven were directors and eighteen were managers. Each interview lasted between one and two \n 9\nhours and was tape-recorded. Each interview was transcribed and summary reports were produced \nwhich were returned to the interviewees for checking in order to ensure accuracy and completeness. \n \nCoding was undertaken by annotating the interview transcriptions with themes relating to potential \ndiffusion factors. This annotation was conducted individually by two researchers. Notes were then \ncompared to discuss and resolve differences. This initial coding was then used to consider each case \nin turn against the five variable groups discussed earlier and listed in Table 1, including the six \nfactors within the \u201cinnovation attributes\u201d variable group. Themes emerging from the data were \ncategorised under one of these headings as appropriate. Each was given a fairly long title to capture \nthe \u201cmessy degree of complexity\u201d (Glaser and Strauss, 1967) common in qualitative research. So, \nfor example, the factor of \u201cProcess efficiencies in cost, time, reliability and flexibility\u201d was \nidentified, and categorised as a sub-factor of \u201cRelative advantage\u201d, itself one of the factors within \nthe \u201cInnovation attributes\u201d variable group.  \n \nWhile themes emerged which were sub-factors of most of the entries in Table 1, there were two \naspects of Rogers\u2019s framework where no themes emerged. Firstly, there were no potential diffusion \nfactors relating to Rogers\u2019s variable group of \u201cCommunication channels used\u201d. Secondly, no \nsubfactors were identified of Rogers\u2019s \u201cObservability\u201d factor within the \u201cInnovation attributes\u201d \nvariable group, although it is clear that the factors within the variable groups \u201cNature of social \nsystem\u201d and \u201cExtent of change agents\u2019 promotion efforts\u201d also relate to communication between \npotential users of the e-marketplace as well as communication between e-marketplace staff and the \nuser base. We will return to this issue in the Discussion section. It was recognised that themes \nmight emerge which were not sub-factors of any of the entries in Table 1, but this eventuality did \nnot arise. \n \nThe strength of the evidence for the influence of the specific sub-factor on diffusion of the e-\nmarketplace was then assessed. This assessment was summarised using the rating system described \nin Table 3, which is adapted from Daniel et al. (2003), and the resulting rating was complemented \nby notes and illustrative quotations. However, such a rating scheme should \u201cbe interpreted as a \nconcise summary of qualitative data, not as an attempt at quantification\u201d (Daniel et al., 2003). This \nqualitative and judgemental process took account of the criteria listed in Table 3, which we will \nbriefly expand upon. Each factor is rated firstly on its presence and secondly on its influence on \nadoption. This can be thought of as the qualitative equivalent of the distinction in quantitative \n 10\nstudies between the value of an independent variable and the association of that variable with a \ndependent variable. For example, the security of commercial data was mentioned by respondents as \na concern that needed to be addressed during the adoption process, but there was little evidence that \nthis concern had in fact influenced the timing or extent of adoption in any of the buyers or suppliers \nstudied. The perceived risk of insecure data is therefore listed as a factor, but one where the \nevidence for the influence on adoption is relatively low.  \n \n[Take in Table 3 about here.] \n \nThe rating of factor influence takes into account two broad issues. The first issue is that of \nconsistency of the evidence between interviewees. Where more than one interviewee corroborates \nthe influence of a factor on adoption, the evidence is regarded as stronger. This is the logic of \ntriangulation (Denzin, 1978). The second issue concerns \u2018theoretical fit\u2019, and specifically: the fit of \nthe data to the proposition; the presence of a plausible explanation for the proposition; and the fit of \nknown rival hypotheses to the data. These three items are inspired by the argument of Campbell \n(1984), who argues that: \n\u201cthe core of the scientific method is not experimentation per se, but rather the strategy \nconnoted by the phrase \u201cplausible rival hypotheses\u201d. This strategy may start its puzzle-\nsolving with \u201cevidence\u201d or it may start with \u201chypothesis\u201d. \nWhichever comes first, Campbell continues, data is considered against a hypothesis, for: a) The fit \nof the hypothesis to data; b) The fit of the hypothesis to other available data; and c) The plausibility \nof rival explanations. In a methodological paper on multiple-case studies, Wilson (2004) argues that \nto these should be added: d) The presence of a plausible explanation of the mechanism by which the \n\u201ccause\u201d produces the \u201ceffects\u201d. \n \nThis process commenced with one case study and was then repeated for each of the other case \nstudies, including scoring of each factor which had been identified in the previous case(s). Any \nmismatch between the subsequent cases and the hypothesised innovation sub-factor caused a \nreview of the sub-factor. If the subsequent case contradicted the proposition, it was to be scored \nnegatively. If the proposition could be modified to cover the new data as well as any previous data, \nthis modification was carried out. For example, the factor \u201cPower of internal change agents to \ndetermine agenda\u201d arose from an influential change agent within a supplier who was using \nSupplyOn. It was reworded as \u201cPower of change agents to determine agenda within and between \n 11\norganisations\u201d, when an influential change agent was found within one of the buying organisations \nusing GHX. \n \nWhilst Table 2 shows some quantitative measures on the diffusion of marketplaces studied, it can \nbe seen that this data has some limitations. The organisations studied all measured their adoption in \ndifferent ways and were sensitive to releasing data that would allow comparison with other \nmarketplaces. The absolute numbers of companies quoted are also difficult to compare, since they \nrepresent a different share of the potential target market in each of the industries considered. For \nexample, there are a limited number of buyers in SupplyOn\u2019s target market (tier 1 automotive \nsuppliers) when compared to the buyers targeted by GHX (hospitals). Since this study is \nexploratory in nature and the diffusion factors identified are assessed qualitatively, it is also \nappropriate to assess the dependent variable - that is, the adoption of the e-marketplace - \nqualitatively. The diffusion data shown in Table 2 was therefore used in conjunction with the views \nexpressed by the interviewees regarding the adoption of the focal marketplace in their industry, to \nform a qualitative judgement of the level of adoption. This is shown in the final row of Tables 4a \nand 4b.  \n \nFINDINGS \nThe factors influencing adoption identified in this study are listed in the left-hand column of Tables \n4a and 4b. The factors are positively related to diffusion except where indicated by \u201c(-ve)\u201d after the \nfactor name. The tables also summarise the evidence for the support for each factor from each case, \nusing the scoring system of Table 3. We discuss the factors below under the headings of Table 1. \n \n[Take in Tables 4a, 4b about here.] \n \nPerceived attributes of the innovation: Relative Advantage  \nFor the automotive suppliers and utilities buyers, the expectation that the e-marketplace would \ndeliver cost-efficient access to new trading partners was a significant motivation. However, for the \nautomotive suppliers that expectation had failed to materialise, and the marketplace was perceived \nas being used by the buyers as a means to increase market transparency:  \n\u201cA lot of potential customers are using marketplaces as a tool to make price comparisons, \nafter which they then go back to their previous supplier, and say, here are the market prices, \nand the previous supplier agrees to supply at this price.\u201d \n 12\nConsistent with this perception, the automotive buyers did not regard this issue of price as a major \nmotivator for the e-marketplace, and similarly the healthcare buyers were not primarily looking for \nprice savings. This contrasted with the utilities buyers, for whom price savings were paramount. \nOne of the primary purposes of Eutilia was to increase competition at a European level for the \nsupply of products and services into the utilities industry:  \n\u201cToday, because of changes in regulation and increased levels of competition, buyers are \nasking us to help them find new suppliers from within the EU, not just their home countries.\u201d \nBy contrast, for the automotive buyers and for both parties in healthcare, the most significant and \nfrequently mentioned advantage of the e-marketplace was in process efficiencies in the areas of \nprocess cost, time, reliability and flexibility. Reported savings included a reduction in errors and \nconsequent processing costs for healthcare buyers and suppliers, reductions in operational costs for \nsupply chain management processes in the case of automotive buyers, and marketing and sales \nsavings for automotive suppliers. These process efficiencies can be summarised as delivering a \nlower transaction cost for the purchase. \n \nAnother group of factors concerns the complementary area of infrastructure costs, related to inter-\norganisational IT integration, administration of directories of products and trading partners, and \napplication development. The e-marketplace can provide a single point of connection for buyers \nand suppliers to integrate their information systems, providing savings as compared with a point-to-\npoint approach, as an automotive supplier stated: \n \u201cThe benefit for us is that we only have to interface once with SupplyOn. As SupplyOn has \nstandardised the processes amongst our target customers, hence we only have to adapt our \nsystems once.\u201d  \nThis rationale was echoed in the healthcare industry: \n\u201cThere is no point in any organisation having any more than one connection. You have to \nmanage it, pay for it, and look after it. It misses the point. It\u2019s like setting up your own \nInternet.\u201d  \nOne of the motivations for the automotive buyers to form the e-marketplace was the realisation that \nthey had large overlaps in their information systems developments. They decided to cooperate in \nthe development of new information systems, and hence reduce development activities at an \nindividual company level. This was also the case for the utilities buyers, but Eutilia\u2019s early \nemphasis on auctions software meant it was less able to prove the worth of this collaborative \n 13\napproach to potential users. This left it vulnerable to replacement by individually purchased \nsoftware, as illustrated by a buyer:  \n\u201cCollaboration with suppliers, transacting over the Internet, is something we really want to \ngo for. E-enabling the procure-to-pay process is a medium\/long-term objective, which we will \ndefinitely achieve. But it\u2019s unlikely to be achieved through the use of third-party services. It is \nfar more likely to be achieved by owning and hosting our own applications.\u201d \nThe final sub-factor of relative advantage concerns perceptions of whether the wider impact of the \ne-marketplace on buyer-supplier relationships is positive or negative. Both parties in automotive \nand healthcare broadly saw the e-marketplace as deepening relationships and complementing \npersonal contact rather than replacing it. A SupplyOn buyer anticipated closer relationships though \nnot always long-lasting ones: \n\u201c[In future] we will have two types of suppliers. The first will be long lasting, close, R&D \nrelationship based partnerships. Then we will have some small number of specific partners \nwho are dedicated to a product or a programme. When the OEM stops the programme, we \nwill have to reconfigure the network, and look for the appropriate suppliers for the next \nchallenge.\u201d \nThis argument of relationship flexibility relates back to the ease of IT integration discussed earlier. \nIt is in contrast to the views expressed by Eutilia\u2019s suppliers, though, who saw the e-marketplace \nhaving at best a neutral and at worst a detrimental effect on buyer-supplier relationships. The \nutilities themselves, the buyers in this marketplace, had a different perspective again, perceiving a \nchange to the procurement process but not to the relationship as such:  \n\u201cThe suppliers will say that it [the e-marketplace\u2019s electronic auctions] is moving us back \ntowards an adversarial relationship, away from partnerships. I don\u2019t think it needs to do that. \nI think what it does is forces us to put more effort in up front, at the specification and tender \nstage. This comes in anyway at the proposed terms stage. What actually is happening is that \nthis is being brought forward.\u201d \nCompatibility  \nFor the companies trading over SupplyOn, the e-marketplace required the adoption of a new set of \nstandardised processes for activities such as the administration of RfQs (requests for quotation). \nThe necessity to make substantial changes to current processes was not necessarily a negative \nfactor, however: indeed, for the automotive buyers who formed SupplyOn, standardisation of \nprocesses at an industry level was a positive objective for the e-marketplace. This intention is \n 14\ncaptured in the original vision for the marketplace: \u201cthe creation and use of a standardised set of \nprocesses and tools supporting the management of the supply chain\u201d. However, the extent of \nchange required can slow adoption. For example, hospitals cannot make use of GHX without a \ncentralised approach to procurement, so biasing early adoption towards those buyers who are at \nleast on the route towards a managed procurement strategy. \n \nRelated to process compatibility is the compatibility of data formats and IT. For example, GHX \nhosts a standardised product catalogue which replaces the imperfectly replicated catalogues \npreviously held by hospitals and their suppliers, a change seen as the principal reason why the \nnumber of errors in the procurement process had reduced to zero in some trials. But producing the \nstandardised catalogue entailed a considerable amount of work, involving changing the descriptions \nof thirty thousand products to an agreed standard for one participant. As with process compatibility, \nalthough this factor slowed the extent of adoption within some companies, it did not appear to \nprevent it if a clear relative advantage could be perceived. \n \nCompatibility with the views of senior management was also a factor. Intriguingly, this seemed an \nissue even in one of Eutilia\u2019s founders, which in an echo of some early B2C dot-com experience \nhad appeared to invest out of a desire to realise a high share price from the e-marketplace, rather \nthan in order to improve buyer-supplier relationships. The e-marketplace now found itself at odds \nwith the utility management\u2019s attitude that software applications should remain in-house rather than \nbe outsourced, and that \u201cit is no longer our view that collaboration between buyers in the same \nindustry would yield benefits\u201d. \n \nFor one of SupplyOn\u2019s founders, changing the perceptions of individuals at operational levels of the \npurchasing function was also seen as essential to adoption: \n\u201cIf you have been working for 20 years in a purchasing department, and your USP is knowing \nwhich supplier is able to produce which part to a particular level of quality, the marketplace \napproach, where all this information is available via a online tool in a instant, can often be \nseen as very threatening.\u201d \nTrialability \nAll three e-marketplaces were benefiting from their decision to make it easy for participants to \nadopt the e-marketplace gradually across its services and product groups and adopt a staged \napproach to business change. Trialability of service adoption was particularly important for \n 15\nSupplyOn\u2019s users, given its wide range of services across the product lifecycle from new product \ndevelopment through procurement to supply chain management. Trialability of adoption across \nproduct groups\/business units was important to hospitals, one starting for example with supplies to \na Catheter Lab, so that new procedures could be tested before being rolled out more widely. \n \nThe third trialability sub-factor concerns the extent to which the standardisation of processes and \nthe integration of internal IT systems with the e-marketplace can be divided to aid early trials. \nAgain, each e-marketplace had done what it could to maximise this, each for example providing the \nmeans for participants to interact with it via the use of a web browser as a simple alternative to full \nintegration. There were understandable limits, though, on the extent to which some core services \ncould be adopted on a limited basis. Because SupplyOn\u2019s early use, for example, focused on the \nstandardisation of RfQs, each participant needed to make appropriate internal changes in order to \nparticipate. The equivalent for GHX is the need to adopt the e-marketplace\u2019s catalogue data format. \nAlthough these issues could slow adoption, they were not viewed as sufficiently significant to \nprevent adoption, and consequently were viewed as an inevitable cost of achieving the perceived \nadvantages. \nComplexity \nThe perceived complexity of e-marketplaces relates closely to the trialability and compatibility \nissues discussed above. In particular, two major aspects of complexity we have mentioned are the \nneed to integrate internal IT systems with the e-marketplace, and the need to make corresponding \nprocess and data changes. The extent to which these acted as brakes on adoption was reduced if \nconnectivity to only one marketplace would be required. The automotive suppliers, for example, \nexpressed concerns about the cost and complexity of having to form relationships with one or more \ne-marketplaces: \n\u201cThe biggest problem for companies using marketplaces is that they are so separate. Which \nmeans that if I want to cover various industries, then I need to take part in many \nmarketplaces, and every marketplace is different in terms of its processes, and means of \nconnection.\u201d \nThis left the supplier feeling unable to invest in full integration, and hence (unlike the automotive \nbuyers) unable to gain fully from the marketplace\u2019s potential to increase process efficiencies, \nreducing its role to \u201clittle more than a glorified fax machine\u201d. Similarly, a hospital buyer stated that \nthe scope of the products that can be procured via the e-marketplace did not cover all the hospital\u2019s \n 16\nneeds, hence \u201climiting the extent to which the [Hospital] Trust can rely on GHX as the sole means \nfor it to conduct commerce electronically\u201d.  \n \nThe lower level of perceived relative advantage in utilities led to a greater reluctance to tackle the \nhurdle of complexity. The buyers interviewed had not yet integrated IT systems, taking the view \nthat: \n\u201cThe challenge is, what is the minimum level of integration that we could do, to see what \nbenefits we could derive, without incurring excess cost?\u201d  \nThe reason for this very different attitude in utilities is still somewhat unclear. As discussed, it \nseems to be partly due to Eutilia\u2019s early focus on auctions, so leaving the case for process \nimprovements through transactional integration unproven. This left it exposed to substitution by \nother means of performing the same limited job of running auctions: \n\u201cThe e-marketplace is not adding a lot of value really. Although at the moment they have the \nexpertise in using the [auction] tools, many other utilities have gone out and bought their \nown applications.\u201d \n \nPerceived Risk  \nThere were three respects in which perceptions of risk figured substantially in the interview data. \nFirstly, concerns about the security of commercial data were mentioned in both the automotive and \nutilities industries. In one instance, relating to the management of user rights, a buying organisation \nrelated the need to be proactively involved in minimising this risk. During a security audit, a test \nbuyer was able to register under the name of a different company and see data sent to this company \nfrom a trading partner. \n \nAnother risk identified was that of reliance on an e-marketplace which might prove unsustainable. \nIn deciding to adopt GHX, one of the hospital buyers had taken into account its backing by some of \nthe largest suppliers in the industry. They believed that this made it financially more secure than \nindependent electronic marketplaces, which were often funded by limited amounts of venture \ncapital. This increased confidence in consortium marketplaces, compared to other ownership \nmodels, lends support to our focus on these in this exploratory study.  \n \n 17\nThe third risk factor related to the risk of change in the external environment, and in legislation and \nregulation in particular. There has been much discussion within the UK\u2019s National Health Service \n(NHS) about possible future centralised purchasing across the NHS, and about the related proposals \nfor a standardised platform for electronic trading. Realisation of this centralised approach was \nlikely to be many years away. However some hospitals did not want to invest in e-marketplace \nadoption that may later become redundant. Others, including those in this study, took the view that \nadvantages to be gained in the meantime from the use of the e-marketplace justified the investment, \ndespite the risk of further changes in the future.  \n \nType of innovation-decision \nFor some suppliers - one in automotive and both in utilities - the main reason for joining the \nmarketplace was none of the positive factors we have discussed - an optimal innovation decision in \nRogers\u2019s (2003) language - but rather buyer pressure. As one put it: \n \u201cThe question for suppliers is not, do I want to take part in SupplyOn or not? But, do I want \nto take part in the automotive industry or not?\u201d  \nAs this suggests, SupplyOn was becoming an important part of the market in which this supplier \noperated. Pressure to use Eutilia was more sporadic, being focused on certain auction events, but \nnevertheless in these instances left suppliers feeling they had no option but to participate. This \nwould suggest the presence of what Rogers refers to as an authority innovation decision.  \n \nNature of social system \nThe presence of strong peer networks and the existence of strong buyer-supplier relationships both \nappeared to aid in the observability of the e-marketplace\u2019s benefits and hence its diffusion in one or \nmore of the cases. The pre-existence of a strong peer network for the larger automotive suppliers \nhad contributed to the formation of SupplyOn: \n\u201cIt\u2019s always the same people coming together and having ideas, this is a network where \ncooperation is stronger than competition, despite some of us being competitors.\u201d \nThe e-marketplace was also proactive in using peer networks amongst the tier 2 and 3 suppliers to \nsupport the recruitment of suppliers, both via publications and face-to-face meetings.  \n \nOften, though, recruitment of suppliers was conducted by buyers, or vice versa, resulting in few \nexamples of new relationships being established as a result of the e-marketplace. Automotive \n 18\nbuyers consciously targeted their key suppliers, one for example having a \u201cgoal of having its \nbusiness relationships with all strategic suppliers conducted solely via SupplyOn from 2003 \nonwards\u201d. The process was the other way round in the case of GHX, which being supplier owned, \nhad suppliers seeking to recruit their key customers.  \n \nAgain the story for Eutilia was rather different. The geographically dispersed utilities had a \nrelatively weak peer network compared with the other cases, as did their suppliers. Attempts by the \nEutilia e-marketplace itself to act as a change agent were also weak, contributing to the medium to \nlow rate of diffusion of this marketplace. We now turn to this issue of change agent behaviour. \n \nExtent of change agents\u2019 promotion efforts \nThe beneficial impact of change agents in the e-marketplace domain has been demonstrated by \nGupta et al. (2005). They term such agents as \u2018network champions\u2019 and find they can play an \nimportant role in bringing buyers and suppliers together and into the marketplace. Evidence of such \nchampions was present in the case of GHX, where the marketplace actively sought out hospitals \nthat had supply chain managers who were viewed as \u201cmaverick, innovators, enthusiastic and open \nto new ideas\u201d. They actively used these managers to engage the supplier\u2019s business unit heads by \norganising joint workshops.  \n \nThe utilities demonstrate the need to avoid those that are resistant and engage change agents with \nboth the power and incentive to enable change: \n \n\u201cAt the beginning we started to speak to procurement people about our auction and \ntendering services, but they were not interested. They said that they managed much better \nwith the paper and face-to-face processes. We would then go to CEOs and senior managers \n[not from procurement] of the same companies, and said that these same services would be \nable to tell them exactly what savings had been made and have data to analyse, such as the \ndetails of tenders, buying criteria and performance against these criteria. They were much \nmore interested than their more junior colleagues. This is particularly true when the buyers \nhad 20 years\u2019 experience, and hence are difficult to move.\u201d \n \n \nThe utility e-marketplace managers also described how they were seeking to act as a change agent \nin the wider industry, but the need for a certain level of adoption before an e-marketplace has the \npower to act as a change agent at this level was evident:  \n 19\n \n\u201cThrough our role as an industry consortium we can play a part in standardisation of \nprocesses and procedures\u2026.. So far we don\u2019t have sufficient numbers of buyers or suppliers \nto do that. Even through we are backed by eleven utilities suppliers, we have yet to change the \nrules of the market in this regard.\u201d \n \nGHX had a similar experience when it tried to enable the adoption of industry standards, for \nexample in catalogue management, only to have to relax its insistence on these standards when \nthere was resistance from some adopters. In recognition of the lack of power that e-marketplaces \nhave in persuading buyers and suppliers to adopt industry level standards, SupplyOn is currently \nworking with various industry bodies to develop these collaboratively.  \n \nANALYSIS BY CASE \nWe have presented twenty-six factors influencing e-marketplace diffusion. Before discussing the \nwider implications of our findings, we will first briefly summarise how the identified factors are \ninter-related in the adoption of each marketplace studied.  \n \nSupplyOn: Of the three e-marketplaces, SupplyOn has diffused most rapidly, with a proposition \nwhich offers some relative advantage to both the tier 1 buyers and their suppliers. The benefits are \nhigher, though, for the buyers, due to the possibility of price savings as well as transaction \nefficiencies and shared infrastructure economies. The pressure to participate in this case therefore \ncomes from these buyers, for whom the costs of involvement (in terms of complexity, compatibility \nand trialability), while significant, have been minimised by the use of existing IT and processes \nwhere possible. Suppliers also stand to gain much from process efficiencies, though, and may also \ngain from increased reach. Trialability is important particularly to smaller suppliers, and is achieved \npartly through a browser-based facility to enable participation prior to full integration. Adoption is \ntherefore likely to increase as buyers move beyond their current efforts to recruit their key, larger \nsuppliers, and focus on smaller suppliers. \n \nGHX: The healthcare sector is relatively immature as far as purchasing automation is concerned \nand hence the short-term competition to the e-marketplace is not point-to-point or private \nmarketplace electronic trading but paper-based processes. Suppliers are adopting GHX aggressively \ndue to the perceived risk of inaction, which includes the risk of competitor e-marketplaces being \nestablished, and the fear that these e-marketplaces may cause pressure on prices due to auctions and \n 20\ncomparative pricing, and require fees to be paid to third parties. Transaction efficiency gains are \nalso regarded as significant. These factors are offsetting the substantial set-up and integration costs. \nAdoption by buyers, though, has some barriers relating to compatibility, particularly with existing \npurchasing structures, and communication, in the form of direction from key staff such as the \npurchasing director. Hospitals with centralised purchasing where the key managers are advocates of \ne-marketplace use are adopting fast due to the considerable efficiency savings that are possible. \nThose with fragmented purchasing structures and with mixed views amongst key staff are adopting \nmore slowly. \n \nEutilia: Whereas SupplyOn, which was also founded by buyers, focused on process benefits in the \nautomation of existing tendering processes, Eutilia\u2019s early focus on auctions provides a perceived \nadvantage to buyers but not to suppliers. With suppliers reluctant to join the e-marketplace, buyers \nalso become reluctant to join, and hence the network effects (Katz and Shapiro, 1986) inherent in a \nmany-to-many marketplace are not realised, dissuading other buyers and suppliers from \nparticipating. Furthermore, buyers can buy and operate their own auction software, effectively \noperating a private marketplace, obviating the need to participate and pay fees to a consortium or \nthird party marketplace. \n \nDISCUSSION  \nIt can be seen from Table 4a and 4b that in the case of two of Rogers\u2019s hypothesised diffusion \nfactors, communication channels and observability, no diffusion sub-factors were identified in our \nresearch. The absence of sub-factors relating to communication channels may reflect the relatively \nearly stage of adoption of e-marketplaces in general and the three we studied in particular: as is \nevident from the subfactors relating to the nature of the social system, diffusion has been so far \noccurring primarily amongst pre-existing peer networks and pre-existing buyer-supplier \nrelationships, by direct personal communication. While Rogers (2003) includes interpersonal \nchannels as well as mass media channels in his discussion of communication channels, we have \npreferred to regard our factors \u201cPresence of strong peer networks\u201d and \u201cPresence of strong existing \nbuyer-supplier relationships\u201d as subfactors of Rogers\u2019s \u201cNature of social system\u201d factor rather than \nas aspects of his \u201cCommunication channel\u201d factor; however, there is clearly an overlap between \nthese two of Rogers\u2019s hypothesised diffusion factors.  \n \n 21\nThe absence of factors relating to observability \u2013 the degree to which the results of an innovation \nare visible to others - may again be a function of the relatively early stage of adoption of the e-\nmarketplaces studied, and the dominance of the pre-existing social system in their diffusion at this \nstage. As is evident from the numerous sub-factors relating to relative advantage, the potential \nbenefits and drawbacks of an e-marketplace are complex, so observing these benefits is not trivial. \nIn our study, this observation seemed to be taking place by rich direct personal communication \namong the existing social network. It may be that no specific subfactors emerged relating to \nobservability because of the lack of variation in this independent variable in our sample: an e-\nmarketplace focused on price negotiation in a commodity market, for example, might prove to have \nsimpler and more readily observable benefits, which may influence its diffusion. We would \ntherefore caution researchers against omitting either this factor or that of communications channels \nin future research, as diffusion of e-marketplaces continues.  \n \nWe now broaden our discussion to consider how the findings of this study relate to extant literature \nand what this suggests for the adoption of electronic consortium marketplaces. Three issues are \nidentified as particularly significant and are discussed in turn: the maturity of relationships, the \nownership of marketplaces and the type of products or services traded. \n \nThe variation in sources of relative advantage across the three cases sheds light on the rival \u201cmove-\nto-the-middle\u201d and \u201cmove-to-the-market\u201d hypotheses in previous literature on inter-organizational \nIT (Malone et al., 1987; Clemons et al., 1993). Much of the experience of SupplyOn and GHX fits \nthe \u201cmove-to-the-middle\u201d model which posits that increased use of IT will result in fewer, longer-\nterm relationships between buyers and suppliers. SupplyOn\u2019s suppliers, though, reported benefits in \nterms of increased reach which is more consistent with the alternative \u201cmove-to-the-market\u201d \nhypothesis. While Eutilia\u2019s adoption to date has been limited, there are many reasons for this in \nsuch issues as change agents\u2019 promotion efforts and perceived risk which do not necessarily \ninvalidate its attempt to \u201cmove-to-the-market\u201d via an e-marketplace.  \n \nA consideration of the relative maturity of the underlying relationships can help to understand this \ncomplex and mixed picture. Where buyer-supplier relationships are relatively mature, the e-\nmarketplace can deliver mutual advantage via process efficiencies and infrastructure cost sharing. \nThe e-marketplace may also aid price transparency and\/or enable some price reductions through \npassing on of lowered costs or bulk buying. Network effects such as standardised IT integration and \n 22\nshared development costs are needed if the e-marketplace is to provide advantage relative to other \nelectronic trading mechanisms such as point-to-point connection or private marketplaces. High \ntransitional costs due to complexity and compatibility factors act to reinforce a concentration on \nfewer key suppliers. The relationship may be further deepened through extensions of e-marketplace \nfunctionality into new product development and supply chain management. \n \nBy contrast, where buyer-supplier relationships are basic or exploratory (McDonald et al., 2000), \nthe e-marketplace may deliver price advantages to buyers through increased reach, price \ntransparency and dynamic pricing. But even here transaction efficiencies on both sides are likely to \nbe the larger opportunity in most cases, as they help to recruit suppliers and hence achieve the \nnetwork effect of increased reach for both parties, which is essential if the e-marketplace is to \ncompete with private marketplaces which offer lower compatibility barriers. Existing relationships \nwill not aid the observability of the e-marketplace to the same extent as when relationships are \nmore mature, so observability is likely to rely more on the change agents\u2019 promotion efforts if the \nnecessary scale is to be achieved for network effects to be present. A single e-marketplace may \ncater for both of these broad types of relationship \u2013 mature and basic - and therefore need to address \nboth the sets of diffusion factors discussed above in respect of their different target segments. \n \nThus network effects, or self-reinforcing advantages accruing from having many e-marketplace \nparticipants (Schilling, 1999), are important for both mature and basic relationships, although their \nimplications for relative advantage vary. We have seen how SupplyOn in particular is achieving \nstrong network effects. Some of the basic transaction efficiencies were already in place in the \nindustry from EDI. So by concentrating on the reach (business directory) and mechanics of \nsourcing (RfQ and auctions), SupplyOn aims for a network effect which is of value to both buyer \nand supplier. The way in which RfQs can ripple through several tiers further strengthens the \nnetwork effect.  \n \nThe \u201cmove-to-the-market\u201d arguments we reviewed earlier, then, are at least not universally \napplicable, being less likely to be valid where existing relationships are mature. Porter\u2019s (2001) \nargument that \u201cswitching costs are likely to be lower, not higher, on the Internet\u201d seems to be far \nfrom the case where mature relationships are further embedded with expensive system and process \nintegration. Only if an e-marketplace achieves a sufficiently high penetration in an industry and all \npotential buyers and suppliers are fully integrated with it will switching costs reduce. Porter\u2019s \n 23\nexpectation of a migration of competition to price is also only partially consistent with our \nevidence. The more mature relationships in the healthcare sector enabled by GHX found no \nadditional pressure on price as a result of e-marketplace use \u2013 although, of course, the e-\nmarketplace had been biased away from price comparisons by its supplier founders. But even in the \ncase of the buyer-owned SupplyOn, only 2% of transactions used its auction functionality, and the \n2.5% price savings reported by one buyer were solely due to bundling of orders within the different \ndivisions of the company. This buyer put much more emphasis on the 55% reduction claimed in \nsourcing process costs and 30% reduction in supply chain management process costs. \n \nCorrespondingly, the \u201cmove-to-the-middle\u201d view from previous literature (Holland, 1995; \nBytheway and Dhillon, 1996) tends to apply only to mature relationships, but with two subtleties. \nFirstly, the e-marketplace tends to support existing strategies to reduce and deepen the supplier base \nrather than acting as a cause in itself. Secondly, although the resulting relationships may be \u201con a \nmuch more intensive scale than before\u201d, as described by one automotive buyer, they are not \nnecessarily long lasting as Clemons et al. (1993) had suggested. The e-marketplace increases the \nflexibility of the supply chain and therefore allows it to be reconfigured rapidly as circumstances \ndemand, as was reported by the users of SupplyOn. \n \nOur observations on ownership are inevitably limited by the set of only three e-marketplaces \nrepresenting only two (buyer and supplier owned consortia) of the several possible ownership \nmodels. Nevertheless, there is little evidence within our cases of a potential evolution of ownership \nmodels towards privately owned functionality as suggested by Krammer (2001) or Stevenson \n(2001). The utilities\u2019 case does offer a limited suggestion of a possible migration from the consortia \nmodel towards privately owned e-hubs. However, as we have argued, a future transition in this case \nis well explained by other factors such as the lack of the necessary network effects in Eutilia\u2019s \napproach, and there is no suggestion of such a transition within the SupplyOn case where these \nnetwork effects are most strongly present.  \n \nGHX is interesting in having so far escaped the logic which regards buyer-owned e-marketplaces as \nmore likely to succeed due to their having by default a ready-made set of customers (Ordanini et al., \n2004; Milliou and Petrakis, 2004). Because GHX does not include auction functionality or \ntransparent comparative pricing, it offers in theory a lower relative advantage to buyers than it \nmight. However, the fragmentation of buyers into individual hospitals and trusts makes the \n 24\ninvestment entailed by private marketplaces seem unlikely in the near future, while GHX is part of \na consortium bidding for the National e-Commerce and Finance System to be set up in England, to \ncover its options. It may indeed prove that this supplier-owned model will ultimately be \ntransitional.  \n \nWe can summarise this discussion on ownership as follows: e-marketplaces are more likely to be \nformed by buyers where these are relatively concentrated, or by suppliers where buyers are \nfragmented and the supply side is relatively concentrated. Large numbers of both buyers and \nsuppliers may favour neutral e-marketplaces formed by start-ups or existing offline intermediaries. \nHowever, the successful diffusion of the e-marketplace will rely on its owners using their power \nwith discretion to ensure that both buyers and suppliers have sufficient motivation to adopt rapidly. \nFurther research is needed to establish whether these observations hold more widely. \n \nOur final observation with respect to previous literature concerns the types of products\/services \nwhich will suit the e-marketplace model. We quoted earlier Porter\u2019s view that the Internet \n\u201cgravitates procurement to standardised products that reduce differentiation\u201d. In similar vein, \nMalone et al. (1987) regarded the complexity of product description and the product specificity \u2013 \nthe extent to which a product is specific to a particular customer and use \u2013 as negative indicators of \nthe use of electronic markets. Our cases do not provide support for this view, SupplyOn flourishing \ndespite the high product specificity and products which could only be described through a complex \nrequest for quotations. We suggest instead that product specificity influences the necessary \nfunctionality of an e-marketplace if network effects are to be achieved. In the case of more \ncommoditised products, the e-marketplace can gain from a shared product catalogue and\/or \ntransparency of pricing and price negotiation support across suppliers. In the case of more tailored \nproducts, the e-marketplace can provide advantage through support for new product development \nand the tendering process, an advantage which is emphasised where multiple tiers are present. \n \nCONCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS \nIn summary, e-marketplaces were hypothesised as vehicles which would lead to increased price \ncompetition and a commoditisation of many product groups. This led to a profusion of start-ups and \nwhilst some have continued to operate, many have failed. To date studies of actual marketplace \nadoption have tended to focus on single industries and have produced an array of antecedents, \nbarriers and benefits, leaving practising managers and those that study this domain uncertain about \n 25\nfuture adoption of e-marketplaces. We have sought to improve understanding in this domain by \nexploring the detailed factors influencing adoption. We have identified twenty-six factors \ninfluencing diffusion, summarised in Table 5. These factors are consistent with previous diffusion \nof innovation literature, in that they form sub-factors of four of Rogers\u2019s (2003 p221) five variable \ngroups, including five of the six most commonly identified attributes of the innovation influencing \nadoption. However, they also provide valuable richness as to the meaning of these factors within \nthis domain that mean that they are practically useful both for acting managers and as a basis for \nfurther research. \n \n[Take in Table 5 about here] \n \nTable 5 also shows the degree of support for each of the factors across the cases for both the buyers \nand suppliers studied. It can be seen that data from the cases supports or is consistent with the \nmajority of factors for both buyers and suppliers, suggesting that these factors are not specific to \neither group and should be addressed when considering the adoption of an e-marketplace by any \norganisation.  \n \nIt should be noted that although the factor \u2018reduced price of goods bought\/sold\u2019 had support from \nboth buyers and suppliers, the impact on uptake is different between the two groups. Consistent \nwith other studies of e-marketplace adoption (Arbin and Essler, 2005; Howard et al. 2006), \nsuppliers are concerned with marketplaces being used to undertake price comparison and hence \npressure from buyers for price reductions. However, this study also finds support from suppliers for \ncompatibility with senior management views, values and strategy, which in all three cases was \naround a desire to find new customers. It would therefore seem that e-marketplaces offer senior \nmanagers in supplying organisations with a dilemma: the opportunity to find new customers, but \nwith the possibility of overall price reductions. Addressing the other factors identified that \npositively contribute to the adoption of e-marketplaces, such as the considerable process \nefficiencies reported by some, could tip the balance towards making adoption of the marketplace \nworthwhile for these suppliers. Without this, suppliers will continue to be reluctant to join e-\nmarketplaces, resulting in the benefits that they have been shown to offer being lost to all. \n \nTable 5 also shows that the perceived risk factor \u2018security of commercial data\u2019 did not yield \nsufficient data to determine the influence on adoption in any of the cases. As shown in Tables 4a \n 26\nand 4b, interviewees cited data security as a concern, but were able to describe how they found \nacceptable ways to mitigate the perceived risks. We have included this factor in Table 5 as we \nbelieve it is an aspect of marketplace adoption that would benefit from further understanding and \nhence should be included in future studies. \n \nOur study also sheds light on how three wider issues will influence the adoption and nature of e-\nmarketplaces, namely the maturity of relationships, ownership models and the nature of the \nproducts or services traded. E-marketplaces used to support mature relationships are likely to place \nrelatively little emphasis on price, with process efficiencies being more important. However, the \nterm \u2018maturity\u2019 does not necessarily refer to the duration of a relationship, rather to the depth of that \nrelationship. As we found in the case of SupplyOn, users intend to use the e-marketplace to form \ndeep relationships with certain partners, but when required to reconfigure them and form equally \ndeep relationships with other partners. Whilst a number of ownership models for e-marketplaces \nhave been suggested, successful diffusion will rely on the owners using their power and influence \nin order to ensure that both buyers and suppliers have sufficient incentives and correspondingly few \ndisincentives to adopt, rather than simply coercing adoption. Finally, high product specificity and \nproduct complexity, rather than limiting e-marketplace adoption, impacts on the specific \nfunctionality required from a marketplace. \n \nA limitation of our study was the small number of marketplaces studied and, to a lesser extent, the \nlimited number of interviews undertaken within each marketplace and its buyers and suppliers. This \nlimits the variation within our data set of products traded and relationship types studied. Our focus \non consortium marketplaces also restricts our observations on ownership models. Although this \nlimited data set is consistent with our exploratory aims, the findings presented should be treated \nwith caution. Other e-marketplaces may exhibit very different sources of advantage or indeed \ndifferent diffusion factors in other respects. Further research could usefully therefore broaden out \nthe examination of e-marketplaces commenced here, including any impacts on diffusion of their \ndifferent emphases in functionality, ownership models, product specificity, relationship maturity \nand vertical industry.  \n \nThe study is also limited by the method employed. Its substantive contribution is in the grounded \ngeneration of a set of factors that appear to influence e-marketplace adoption, not in testing the \nrelative impact of these factors across a representative sample of e-marketplaces and their users. \n 27\nThus conclusions cannot be made concerning the extent to which adoption is influenced, for \nexample, by low levels of supply chain process complexity and high levels of e-marketplace service \ntrialability in a specific industry. Further research to test the relative impact of the factors we have \ndescribed on adoption via a cross-sectional survey would be useful. The findings reported in this \nstudy provide a base on which such a quantitative study could build multi-item scales for diffusion \nfactors as independent variables.  \n \nREFERENCES \n \nAlbrecht, C.C., Dean, D.L., Hansen, J.V., (2005).
