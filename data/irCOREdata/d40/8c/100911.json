The substitu-\ntion of nitrogen on a few percent of the arsenic sites reduces\nthe band gap and lattice constant simultaneously, allowing\nGaInNAs alloys with band gaps in the optical fiber wave-\nlength range of 1.3 to 1.55 \u0003m to be lattice matched to\nGaAs.1 While dilute nitride arsenides have been heavily\nstudied, dilute nitride antimonides have received relatively\nlittle attention. For instance, a recent review by Vurgaftman\nand Meyer of nitrogen containing semiconductors high-\nlighted a complete lack of experimental results on\nGaNxSb1\u2212x,2 even though band-gap reduction has been ob-\nserved in InNxSb1\u2212x.3,4 Although the growth of GaNxSb1\u2212x as\na step towards realizing the growth of Sb-rich GaInNAsSb\nhas recently been reported,5 no optical studies of the\nGaNxSb1\u2212x alloy were presented.\nIn dilute nitrides, the substitution of highly electronega-\ntive nitrogen for a few percent of the host anions results in\nthe formation of a highly localized resonant band close to the\nconduction band minimum.6,7 The band-gap reduction due to\nthe localized interaction between the host conduction band\nand the narrow resonant level, formed by the nitrogen states,\ncan be described by the band anticrossing \u0001BAC\u0002 model.6\nConsidering that the electronegativity mismatch between ni-\ntrogen and antimony is greater than for any other combina-\ntion of commonly used group V elements, the band-gap re-\nduction in dilute nitride antimonides is expected to be more\nextreme than for dilute nitride arsenides. Furthermore, dilute\nnitride antimonides have useful potential device applications.\nFor instance, the GaNxSb1\u2212x ternary alloy is suitable for\n2\u20135 \u0003m midinfrared applications and the related quaternary,\na\u0002Permanent address: Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, DC 20375-\n5347.\nb\u0002Author to whom correspondence should be addressed; electronic mail:\nC.F.McConville@warwick.ac.uk\n0003-6951\/2005\/87\u000213\u0001\/132101\/3\/$22.50 87, 13210\nDownloaded 30 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject toGa1\u2212yInyNxSb1\u2212x, can be lattice matched to GaSb.\nHere, the structural, optical, and transport properties of\ndilute GaNxSb1\u2212x \u00010\u0001x\u00020.02\u0002 thin films are reported. The\nGaNxSb1\u2212x samples were grown using nitrogen plasma-\nassisted molecular-beam epitaxy \u0001MBE\u0002; details can be\nfound elsewhere.8 Thin films \u0001nominally 250 nm\u0002 of\nGaNxSb1\u2212x were grown on undoped GaSb\u0001001\u0002 substrates\nwith 150-nm GaSb buffer layers. Thicker GaNxSb1\u2212x layers\n\u00012 \u0003m\u0002 for characterization by Hall measurements and ab-\nsorption spectroscopy were also grown on semi-insulating\n\u0001SI\u0002 GaAs\u0001001\u0002 substrates using a 1-\u0003m AlSb buffer. The\nuse of an insulating substrate, which also has a much larger\nband gap than the GaNxSb1\u2212x alloys, allows the electrical and\noptical properties to be investigated without being affected\nby substrate conduction or optical absorption in the wave-\nlength range of interest. All samples were characterized by\nhigh-resolution x-ray diffraction \u0001XRD\u0002 of the symmetric\n004 reflection using a Philips diffractometer with Cu K\u0004 ra-\ndiation \u0001\u0005=0.15406 nm\u0002. Additionally, reciprocal-space\nmapping around the symmetric 004 and asymmetric 224 re-\nflections was performed on some samples using a PANalyti-\ncal x-ray diffractometer. Optical absorption measurements\nwere taken using a Perkin Elmer Spectrum GX Fourier trans-\nform infrared spectrometer, using a HgCdTe detector, allow-\ning an energy range of 100\u2013970 meV to be investigated.\nThe XRD results from a GaNSb film grown on\nGaSb\u0001001\u0002 at a temperature of 400 \u00b0C using a nitrogen\nplasma power of 200 W and with nominal dilute nitride film\nthicknesses of 250 nm are shown in Fig. 1. In addition to the\nsubstrate and epilayer peaks, a series of Pendellosung inter-\nference fringes is visible. The presence of these fringes, as\nwell as an epilayer peak full width at half maximum of 65\narc sec close to the theoretical value \u000160 arc sec\u0002, indicates\nthe layer is pseudomorphic with excellent crystalline quality.\nBy comparison with simulated spectra, assuming Vegard\u2019s\nlaw with no lattice relaxation, a N fraction of 0.80\u00b10.03%\nwas determined for this sample.

Lett. 87, 132101 \u00022005\u0001shown to be valid for dilute nitrides, both theoretically9 and\nexperimentally for N contents up to at least 10%.10\nThe determination of the amount of nitrogen incorpora-\ntion in the GaNxSb1\u2212x samples grown on GaAs substrates\nrequired more investigation. Since the 2-\u0003m-thick\nGaNxSb1\u2212x epilayers are expected to be at least partially re-\nlaxed, measurement of the symmetric 004 rocking curve is\ninsufficient to determine uniquely the N content of each\nlayer. Normally, asymmetric rocking curves, such as 224, are\nalso measured and simulated to enable the effects of lattice\nrelaxation and composition to be separated. However, if the\nepilayer is subject to tetragonal distortion, the asymmetric\nplane of the epilayer may become inclined with respect to\nthat of the substrate. This means a conventional one-\ndimensional \u0006-2\u0007 scan is inaccurate because such a scan\nonly measures along the \u0003224\u0004 direction of the substrate,\nbuffer layer, or GaNxSb1\u2212x layer.11 Therefore two-\ndimensional \u00012D\u0002 reciprocal space mapping of the 004 and\n224 Bragg peaks has been performed.\nThe 224 reciprocal space map of a 2-\u0003m-thick\nGaNxSb1\u2212x epilayer is shown in Fig. 2. This sample was\ngrown using the same temperature and N plasma conditions\nas the sample grown on GaSb shown in Fig. 1. Reciprocal\nspace mapping revealed that the sample was almost fully\nrelaxed and that the nitrogen content was 0.78\u00b10.03%, in\nagreement with the epilayer grown on a GaSb substrate\n\u00010.80%\u0002. Additionally, these data reveal that the \u0001224\u0002 planes\nof the epilayer and buffer are inclined by 0.05\u00b0 and \u22120.10\u00b0,\nrespectively, with respect to the \u0001224\u0002 planes of the substrate.\nThis corresponds to the residual strain in both the buffer\nlayer and epilayer of 1.6\u00b10.4%. These results confirm that\nthe nitrogen incorporation is independent of the substrate\nused, for samples grown under the same conditions. The sur-\nface morphology of samples grown on AlSb\/GaAs-SI is\nsimilar to that of films grown on GaSb under the same con-\nditions, with root mean square roughness values of typically\n1.5 nm over a 5\b5 \u0003m atomic force microscopy \u0001AFM\u0002\n8\nFIG. 1.

The simulation \u0001dotted lines\u0002\nindicates that the anionsublattice of the GaNSb layer contains 0.80% N and\nthat the film thickness is 252\u00b110 nm.

Redistribution subject toSingle-field Hall measurements showed the GaNxSb1\u2212x\nlayers grown on AlSb\/GaAs to be p-type with carrier densi-\nties in the high 1017 cm\u22123 range. This p-type conductivity is\nconsistent with Walukiewicz\u2019s amphoteric native defect\nmodel.12 The formation of acceptorlike impurities and de-\nfects are favored because of the proximity of the \t-point\nvalence band maximum \u0001VBM\u0002 in GaSb to the universal\nbranch-point energy, EB.13 The incorporation of dilute\namounts of nitrogen should not change this. While the inter-\naction in dilute nitrides between the host conduction band\nand the resonant nitrogen level is highly localized in k-space,\nEB defines the average midgap position across the entire Bril-\nlouin zone. Since the valence bands are unaffected by dilute\namounts of nitrogen,6 the dilute nitride alloy GaNxSb1\u2212x ex-\nhibits unintentional p-type conductivity like GaSb as a result\nof the Fermi level stabilizing close to EB.14 In GaSb, due to\nthe lack of a sufficient density of amphoteric defects to sta-\nbilize the Fermi level, the unintentional p-type doping is\nlower than in GaNSb. In bulk- and MBE-grown GaSb, hole\ndensities of p\u00051017 cm\u22123 and p\u0005 low-1016 cm\u22123, respec-\ntively, are typically observed. The defects responsible for the\ngreater p-type conductivity in the GaNSb may be disloca-\ntions from the lattice-mismatched growth and\/or damage-\ninduced point defects created by the N plasma during\ngrowth.\nOptical absorption spectra recorded from 2-\u0003m-thick\nGaNxSb1\u2212x layers with different nitrogen contents \u00010\u0001x\n\u00020.02\u0002 and a GaSb reference epilayer are shown in Fig. 3.\nThe oscillations in the absorption spectra are Fabry-Perot\noscillations caused by the reflection of light at the surface\nand at the interfaces between different materials in the\nsamples. The turn on of the fundamental absorption obeys a\nsquare law, consistent with direct band-gap absorption. The\nband gap of each GaNxSb1\u2212x epilayer is estimated by ex-\ntrapolating the linear part of \u00042E2 to the base line, where \u0004 is\nthe absorption coefficient and E is the photon energy. Using\nthis method, the band gap obtained for the GaSb thin film is\nFIG. 2.

Analysis of the 004 and 224 maps indicates that the anion\nsublattice of the GaNSb layer contains 0.78% N and that the epilayer is fully\nrelaxed.

Incorporating 1.52% N into GaSb results in a band\nreduction of \u0005320 meV. For comparison, the incorporation\nof 1.5% N in GaAs results in a band-gap reduction of\n\u0005220 meV.7 As mentioned previously, the larger electrone-\ngativity mismatch between nitrogen and antimony \u0001com-\npared to nitrogen and arsenic\u0002 results in greater band-gap\nreduction for the same amount of nitrogen substitution.\nIt is known that lattice-mismatch-induced strain results\nin the modification of the band structure.15 Since the samples\ninvestigated here have been shown to be almost fully re-\nlaxed, for our optical studies this effect can be neglected.\nAdditionally, effects such as the Moss-Burstein shift of the\nabsorption edge16,17 and band-gap shrinkage due to band\nrenormalization,18 to which narrow gap and heavily doped\nsemiconductors can be susceptible, are negligible here. This\nis because the GaNxSb1\u2212x layers are moderately p-type; for\nthe measured hole densities, the bulk Fermi level lies close to\nthe VBM. Therefore, the band-gap reduction observed can be\nsolely attributed to the interaction between the host conduc-\ntion band and the nitrogen resonant states. Further studies are\nFIG. 3.

Redistribution subject tothe role of the nonparabolic host conduction band.\nTo conclude, high quality GaNxSb1\u2212x samples have been\ninvestigated by a combination of XRD, Hall measurements,\nand absorption spectroscopy. Full reciprocal space mapping\nrevealed that the amount of nitrogen incorporation was inde-\npendent of the substrate used, with the samples grown on\nGaAs substrates with AlSb buffer layers being almost fully\nrelaxed. The optical measurements revealed a band-gap red-\nshift with increasing nitrogen content. XRD and Hall mea-\nsurements rule out contributions from strain, Moss-Burstein\nshift, and band renormalization. Therefore, the effect is\nsolely due to the substitution of nitrogen for antimony. Fi-\nnally, the band-gap reduction as a function of N content is\ngreater than that observed in GaNAs.\nThe authors would like to thank Dr. David Lee and Dr.\nNeil Wilson for performing the Hall measurements and\nAFM, respectively.
