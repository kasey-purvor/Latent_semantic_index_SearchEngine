Palynology suggests that plant groups, including ferns and putative pteridosperms, 25 \nwere affected by changing sea level, and that there is a theoretical possibility of 26 \nconnection between cyclicity and the first appearance of walchiacean conifer-like 27 \nmonosaccate pollen such as Potonieisporites. Long term terrestrial and marine increasing 28 \n\u03b413C (organic) may reflect the onset of major glaciation in Gondwana, since there is 29 \nevidence to suggest that the two are coeval, but no specific mechanism can be suggested 30 \nto link the trends. 31 \n 32 \nKeywords: Carboniferous palaeoecology palynology isotopes 33 \n 34 \n 35 \nA series of small linked, fault-controlled basins developed across northern and central 36 \nEngland in late Devonian and Mississippian times, in response to regional north-south 37 \nextension (Fig. 1; Chadwick et al. 1995; Fraser & Gawthorpe 2003). Initial extension 38 \n 3\nwas rapid and fault-controlled with the positions of the basins and blocks determined 39 \nlargely by basement structure. Thick sequences of clastic sediments accumulated in the 40 \nbasins at this time, compared with those on the blocks. This gave way to a more uniform, 41 \nregional subsidence from late Vis\u00e9an through Namurian times, though localised faulting 42 \nstill occurred at block margins (Collinson 1988). In the Central Pennine Basin (Central 43 \nProvince), south of the Lake District and Askrigg blocks, the Namurian basin was filled 44 \nmainly by turbidite and pelagic deposits. The repeated occurrence of goniatite-bearing 45 \nmudstone bands in this sequence allows a highly-refined Namurian biostratigraphical 46 \nscheme (Ramsbottom et al. 1978; Waters & Davies 2006). By contrast, across the 47 \nNorthumberland-Solway and Stainmore basins, and the Alston and Askrigg blocks, high-48 \nfrequency \u2018Yoredale\u2019-type cyclic sedimentation was established in Asbian times, and 49 \npersisted into the Namurian (Ramsbottom 1977; Wright & Vanstone 2001). In this area 50 \nlimestone dominates the marine phase, succeeded by clastic sediments deposited from 51 \nprograding delta systems. 52 \nThe palaeoenvironments of the terrestrial realm in the Namurian of the central and 53 \nnorthern provinces are much less well studied than their Westphalian counterparts, 54 \nprobably because fewer Namurian coals are thick enough to have been exploited. 55 \nHowever, the terrestrial macroflora was similar (Cleal & Thomas 1995). Broadly the 56 \nsame spores that dominate the palynological assemblages are also characteristic of the 57 \ncoal swamp forests of the Westphalian of NW Europe, for example, Lycospora and 58 \nCrassispora. Present also were fern spores, putative pteridosperm spores (e.g. 59 \nSchulzospora) and larger pollen that can be related to primitive conifers of the 60 \n 4\nWalchiaceae (e.g. Potonieisporites; Poort & Veld 1997) and to the cordaites (e.g. 61 \nFlorinites; Falcon-Lang & Scott 2000). The palaeoecology of these plants has been 62 \nstudied exhaustively in rocks of Westphalian age, particularly in relation to coal quality 63 \nand distribution (e.g. Scott 1979; Phillips & DiMichele 1981), and more recently with 64 \nregard to climate change and cyclicity (e.g. Phillips & Peppers 1984; Cecil 1990; 65 \nDiMichele et al. 2002; Falcon-Lang & Bashforth 2004). 66 \nStudies of palaeoecology in relation to cyclicity in the British Namurian are restricted to 67 \npalynology in the Central Pennine Basin (e.g. Neves 1958; Turner et al. 1994; Davies & 68 \nMcLean 1996), which recognised increased numbers of pollen in marine bands. These 69 \nphenomena were described by Chaloner (1958) as the \u2018Neves Effect\u2019 and interpreted as 70 \ndue to drowning of coastal lowland plants leading to over-representation by pollen 71 \nproduced by upland plants. However no detailed multidisciplinary studies have been 72 \nmade of palaeoecology and its relationship to climate change and cyclicity in the early 73 \nNamurian. This is an interesting interval since it was at this time that large scale 74 \nCarboniferous glaciation began in the Southern Hemisphere (Gonz\u00e1lez-Bonorino & Eyles 75 \n1995; Isbell et al. 2003), and this is linked with increasing frequency and amplitude of 76 \nglacioustatic sea level changes in NW Europe (Waters & Davies 2006). The onset of 77 \nglaciation was also linked by Cecil (1990) and Cecil et al. (1993) to farfield climate 78 \nchange that also had a strong influence on sedimentation. Thus the aim of this paper is to 79 \ndocument cyclicity and palaeoenvironmental change in early Namurian successions. In 80 \norder to understand the distribution of marine sediments in the successions we also apply 81 \na technique new to mixed Palaeozoic clastic-carbonate successions that involves tracking 82 \n 5\nthe \u03b413C of sedimentary organic matter. 83 \nGeological setting 84 \nStratigraphy 85 \nThe early Namurian strata of the Throckley (NZ 14557 67617) and Rowlands Gill (NZ 86 \n1664 5815) boreholes near Newcastle-upon-Tyne, were analysed for \u03b413C (bulk organic 87 \nmatter and wood fragments), palynology, palynofacies, sedimentology and 88 \nmacropalaeontology. The Throckley Borehole is within the Northumberland Trough, and 89 \nthe Rowlands Gill Borehole is south of the Ninety Fathom Fault, and thus is positioned 90 \non the Alston Block (Fig. 1). The Namurian strata in the boreholes contain approximately 91 \n10 large sedimentary cycles, assigned to the Stainmore Formation, each cycle consisting 92 \nof fossiliferous limestone overlain by (usually unfossiliferous) black mudstone, followed 93 \nby sandstone upon which there is a seatrock and then by a thin coal seam. In this paper 94 \nwe focus mainly on two large cycles of the lower, Pendleian-Arnsbergian part of the 95 \nsection, delimited by (in ascending order) the Lower Felltop Limestone, the Coalcleugh 96 \nLimestone and the Upper Felltop Limestone (Fig. 2 ). 97 \nIn the area around Newcastle-upon-Tyne, the Lower Felltop Limestone is around 6 m 98 \nthick, and includes a fauna of bryozoa, brachiopods and chaetetids (Mills & Holliday 99 \n1998; Pattison 1980). The thickness of strata between the Lower Felltop and Upper 100 \nFelltop limestones ranges from 31 to 65 m, being less on the Alston Block (e.g. Rowlands 101 \nGill Borehole) than in the Northumberland Basin (e.g. Throckley Borehole). This 102 \nsequence is laterally variable, and its lower part is mainly arenaceous, while its upper 103 \n 6\npart is argillaceous. Marine beds also occur, for example the Pike Hill Limestone (or its 104 \nlateral equivalent the Coalcleugh Limestone), which is correlated with the Coalcleugh 105 \nShell Bed on parts of the Alston block. The Pike Hill Limestone\/Coalcleugh Limestone is 106 \nusually argillaceous limestone or shaley calcareous mudstone with ironstone nodules, and 107 \nranges between 3.5 and 5 m thick. Fauna from this limestone in the Ouston (BJ 40800 108 \n05699) and Throckley boreholes includes clisiophyllid corals, bryozoa, brachiopods and a 109 \nfew bivalves. Thin coals and seatearths also occur in this sequence, for example the 110 \nChapel House Coal, which has been worked in the area. The Upper Felltop Limestone is 111 \none of the thickest and most persistent limestones in the Namurian of the Newcastle area. 112 \nIt varies between 2 and 7.3 m thick and is pale grey to grey, medium to coarse-grained 113 \nand crinoidal, with a rich Namurian fauna including rugose corals, bryozoa, brachiopods 114 \nand rare bivalves. 115 \nIn the Tyne to Stainmore area to the south of Newcastle, the Lower Felltop Limestone is 116 \nwidely exposed (e.g. in Alston Moor, Rookhopehead and Coalcleugh) as a grey, fine 117 \ngrained limestone varying between 0.3 and 2 m thick. It was used for lime-burning and 118 \ncontains the alga Girvanella, as well as brachiopods. Beds above the Lower Felltop 119 \nLimestone contain a sequence of variable sandstone units named the \u2018Transgression 120 \nBeds\u2019 by Carruthers (1938) and the Coalcleugh Beds by Dunham (1990). The beds 121 \ncontain flaggy sandstone and ganisters that have been quarried. Dunham (1990) 122 \nsuggested that in places erosion associated with the sandstones has cut out the Lower 123 \nFelltop Limestone, e.g. in the Derwent Valley. Above the sandstones in the Tyne to 124 \nStainmore area are coals including the Coalcleugh Coal which reaches 56 cm in 125 \n 7\nthickness, followed by a series of marine beds which have been measured and described 126 \nin North Grain Opencast Quarry (NY883448), near Allenheads. The beds there include 127 \n60 cm of shale with marine fossils, which correlate with the Coalcleugh Limestone of the 128 \nThrockley and Rowlands Gill sections, and above this are 6 m of apparently 129 \nunfossiliferous black micaceous shales. The thickness of the Coalcleugh marine beds to 130 \nthe base of the Upper Felltop Limestone varies between 25 m and 33.5 m (Dunham 131 \n1990). 132 \nAge 133 \nThe faunal sequence of goniatites of the Namurian of the Central Pennine Basin does not 134 \noccur in the Northumberland Basin and Alston Block, and goniatites are extremely rare, 135 \nthus dating involves reference to palynology, foraminifera and lithostratigraphy. 136 \nThe lowest studied part of the Throckley Borehole between 358.33 and 243.23 m is 137 \nassigned to the capistratus \u2013 nitidus (CN) Biozone (Owens et al. 2004) based on the 138 \npresence of Bellispores nitidus, Cingulizonates cf. capistratus as well as the occurrence 139 \nof accessory taxa, e.g. Crassispora kosankei, Grandispora spinosa, 140 \nMicroreticulatisporites concavus, Rugospora corporata, Rotaspora fracta, Remysporites 141 \nmagnificus, Tripartites trilinguis and T. vetustus. The top of the section assigned to the 142 \nCN Biozone is difficult to ascertain because the base of the succeeding zone of Owens et 143 \nal. (2004), the trigallerus \u2013 knoxi (TK) Biozone, cannot be positioned precisely in this 144 \nborehole. However Owens et al. (2004) mention that Cingulizonates cf. capistratus 145 \ndisappears at the top of the CN Biozone, and the level of its last appearance is used 146 \n 8\nprovisionally to mark this level in the Throckley Borehole. 147 \nPerhaps the most distinct palynostratigraphical level in the Throckley Borehole is marked 148 \nby the first appearance of common Crassispora kosankei at 126.5 m. This event, in part, 149 \ndefines the base of the kosankei \u2013 varioreticulatus (KV) Biozone, and has long been 150 \nassociated with the base of the Kinderscoutian (R1, Owens et al. 1977), though Owens et 151 \nal. (2004) now consider it to be late Alportian. The first occurrence of Lycospora 152 \nsubtriquetra, slightly lower, at 136 m, suggests that the subtriquetra \u2013 ornatus (SO) 153 \nBiozone may extend from 136 to 126.5 m. Owens et al. (2004) considered the SO 154 \nBiozone to span the late Arnsbergian to early Alportian. 155 \nBy contrast Riley (1992) concluded that foraminifera in the Lower Felltop Limestone in 156 \nthe Rowlands Gill Borehole indicated that the base of the Arnsbergian Substage should 157 \nbe taken at the base of the limestone (Fig. 2). Indirect stratigraphical evidence supports 158 \nthis age assignment. In North Yorkshire, the base of the Arnsbergian Substage can be 159 \nprecisely positioned because of the occurrence of the E2a goniatite Cravenoceras 160 \ncowlingense Bisat in limestone or marine mudstone above the Mirk Fell Ganister 161 \n(Dunham 1990). The Mirk Fell Ganister has been traced into sandstone underlying the 162 \nLower Felltop Limestone in the Brough-under-Stainmore area, south of the present area 163 \nof study (Dunham 1990).  164 \nThus, there is a conflict between the ages suggested by lithostratigraphical correlation and 165 \nforaminifera on the one hand, and palynology on the other. The assignment to the CN 166 \nBiozone of the interval 358.33 \u2013 243.23 m in the Throckley Borehole suggests, through 167 \npalynological correlation, that the Pendleian extends up to 243.23 m, whereas 168 \n 9\nlithostratigraphic correlation and foraminifera suggest that the Lower Felltop Limestone 169 \nis Arnsbergian, however a general early Namurian (Serpukhovian) age is clear. 170 \nSedimentology and facies analysis 171 \nThe sedimentological characteristics and distribution of marine fauna between 105 and 172 \n325 m in the Throckley Borehole and between 120 and 222 m in the Rowlands Gill 173 \nBorehole (after Brand 1987; Mills & Holliday 1998) are shown in Figs. 3 and 4 174 \nrespectively. Excellent core preservation of the Rowlands Gill Borehole between 135 and 175 \n222 m allowed detailed palaeoenvironmental interpretation (Fig. 4). Lack of continuous 176 \ncore prevented similar analysis in the Throckley Borehole. The bulk of the sequence in 177 \nthe Rowlands Gill Borehole is made up of coarsening upward cycles beginning with 178 \nfissile mudstone and siltstones, which are either unfossiliferous or contain rare marine 179 \nfossils. These generally become completely unfossiliferous upsection and coarsen up to 180 \ncontain lenses of sandstone with wave ripple marks, before becoming fine-grained 181 \nsandstone, commonly rooted, toward the top of the cycle. Rooting and a bleached colour 182 \nindicate that contemporaneous pedogenic processes affected some cycles, suggesting 183 \nfairly prolonged subaerial exposure. A number of these coarsening upward cycles 184 \nculminate in thin (1-2 cm thick) coal seams (e.g. at 177 and 200.5 m) which may alternate 185 \non a centimetre-scale with thin mudstone beds in places containing marine fossils.  186 \nThe coarsening-upward cycles are interpreted as delta progradational interdistributary bay 187 \nfills, the lower finer-grained sediment being the first stages of fill and the last sandier 188 \nsediment being mouth bar deposits into shallow water. The coals probably formed due to 189 \n 10\nterrestrial plant colonization of emergent mouthbar and other sediment platforms. 190 \nAlternation of marine sediment and coal at the top of the more complete cycles may 191 \nrelate to small-scale cyclic relative sea level rise which is not expressed in the deeper 192 \nwater facies, or delta sedimentation processes. Limestones in the sequence in the 193 \nRowlands Gill Borehole are grey, micritic, muddy and crinoidal and sometimes coarsen 194 \nup into cleaner bioclastic limestone. The limestones are interpreted to have been 195 \ndeposited at sea level highstands, and the coarsening upward trend is attributed to upward 196 \nshoaling. The bases of limestone units are often sharp, interpreted as ravinement surfaces, 197 \nand may be associated with a truncated underlying cycle (chiefly marked by the absence 198 \nof coal), implying small amounts of erosion. 199 \nIntensely bioturbated, greenish, sideritic sandstone units (wave rippled toward the top) 200 \nwith marine and trace fossils (e.g. Monocraterion, Teichichnus) occur at two levels in the 201 \nsequence (151 \u2013 157 m and 187 \u2013 189 m). The base of these units is sharp and erosive 202 \nand may impinge on the upper mouth bar deposits of the coarsening upward cycles. 203 \nThese sandstones are interpreted as deposits of shelf sandbodies driven by tides and 204 \nmarine currents in shallow water.  205 \nAt three levels (134 to 142.5 m; 142.5 to 146 m; 184.5 to 187 m) are units of fine to 206 \nmedium grained (rarely coarse grained) micaceous, silty or feldspathic sandstones, often 207 \nwith plant fragments and large (metre-scale) cross beds. The bases of these units are 208 \nerosional and the units are interpreted as having been laid down by distributary channels 209 \nof varying sizes. The bases of the coarser units may mark the positions of non-sequences. 210 \n 11\nOrganic carbon isotope ratios 211 \nChanging \u03b413C of bulk organic matter within clastic sequences has been shown to be of 212 \nvalue in delimiting marine and non-marine intervals (e.g. Foster et al. 1997; Gorter et al. 213 \n1995; Newmann et al. 1973; Maynard 1981) because marine sedimentary organic matter 214 \n(usually of algal origin) has a different \u03b413C value from that of terrestrial organic matter 215 \n(mainly wood fragments and palynomorphs). In Permian sequences, \u03b413C marine organic 216 \nmatter is generally c.\u201330\u2030 (Lewan 1986; Foster et al. 1997), and \u03b413C terrestrial is c.\u2013217 \n24\u2030 (Foster et al. 1997). Peters-Kottig et al. (2006) measured \u03b413C from terrestrial 218 \norganic matter from plant fossils, cuticles, humic coals and bulk terrestrial material 219 \nthrough the Late Palaeozoic. During the late Mississippian and early Pennsylvanian 220 \nvalues are around \u201323.5\u2030, rising slightly to around \u201323\u2030 in the late Pennsylvanian. 221 \nValues of \u03b413C for late Mississippian - early Pennsylvanian marine organic matter are 222 \nvery scarce; Lewan (1986) recorded mean values for the Mississippian of \u201328.55\u2030 (4 223 \nmeasurements) and \u201328.03\u2030 for the Pennsylvanian (3 measurements). 224 \nMigrated hydrocarbons affect \u03b413C bulk values particularly if they are markedly different 225 \nin geochemical origin from the in situ material analysed (Stephenson et al. 2005). For this 226 \nstudy all samples were treated to remove migrated hydrocarbons; samples were then 227 \nprepared as set out by Stephenson et al. (2005), including the separation and \u03b413C 228 \nanalysis of microscopic wood fragments (500-1000 \u00b5m), liberated by palynological 229 \nprocessing. The distribution of values shows that in the mixed marine\/terrestrial sequence 230 \nof the Throckley and Rowlands Gill boreholes, \u03b413C (bulk) is most likely a function of the 231 \nratio of \u03b413C marine organic matter to \u03b413C terrestrial (Figs. 3 and 4). The main 232 \n 12\nexcursions in \u03b413C (bulk) (to a minimum of c.\u201331\u2030) correspond with marine intervals as 233 \ndefined by limestone and marine macrofossil distribution, suggesting that known marine 234 \nrocks contain low \u03b413C organic matter. This organic matter is displayed in palynological 235 \nslides as amorphous organic matter (AOM), which is commonly believed to be of algal 236 \norigin (e.g. Lewan 1986). \u03b413C of microscopic wood fragments (\u03b413C wood) from 237 \nsamples split and also analysed for \u03b413C (bulk) is substantially the same as \u03b413C (bulk) at 238 \nlevels where both were measured (Fig. 3). 239 \nPalynology and palynofacies 240 \nPollen and spores are generally poorly preserved but identifiable at least to generic level. 241 \nCounts of around 150 palynomorphs per slide were taken initially and then each slide was 242 \nscanned for additional taxa. Yield of palynomorphs is high in all lithologies apart from 243 \nthe purer limestones where residues are dominated by AOM, though palynomorphs are 244 \nalso usually present. In this study of palynomorphs and palynofacies in relation to 245 \ncyclicity we concentrate on the best developed cycles between the Lower and Upper 246 \nFelltop limestones. The most common palynomorph types in this section are 247 \nCingulizonates spp., Cristatisporites spp., Crassispora kosankei, Densosporites spp., 248 \nGranulatisporites spp., Knoxisporites spp., Leiotriletes spp., Lycospora pusilla, 249 \nRemysporites magnificus, Schulzospora spp. and indeterminate monosaccate pollen. 250 \nRarer taxa include Knoxisporites stephanephorus, Potonieisporites spp., Savitrisporites 251 \nnux, Tripartites vetustus and various scolecodonts, which are the mouthparts of marine 252 \npolychaete worms. Pollen and spores are arranged into palaeocommunities by relating 253 \nthem to their parent plants (see Willard et al. 1995; Davies & McLean 1996; 254 \n 13\nDiMichele & Phillips 1996; Table 1, Figs. 5 and 6), and palynofacies elements are 255 \ngrouped as in Table 2. The scheme used was that of Davies & McLean (1996), based in 256 \nthe Namurian of northern England. This scheme was considered generally applicable 257 \ndespite the fact that the plant affinities of most of the palynomorph taxa are known from 258 \nWestphalian rather than Namurian fructifications. This is because we consider that well-259 \ndefined and distinct morphotypes e.g. Lycospora pusilla, Potonieisporites novicus, 260 \nCrassispora kosankei, Leiotriletes\/Granulatisporites and Schulozospora, which range 261 \nthrough the Namurian into the Westphalian, represent broadly the same conditions 262 \nthroughout that time period. The scheme was, however, slightly modified to include new 263 \ndata about the ecological preferences of cordaites which are known to colonise a wide 264 \nrange of habitats (see Falcon-Lang & Scott 2000) and thus cannot be considered to be 265 \nprimarily extrabasinal. Thus cordaites (represented by Florinites) were excluded from the 266 \nextrabasinal category of Davies & McLean (1996). Within the non-forest mire category 267 \nof Davies & McLean (1996), Granulatisporites\/Leiotriletes were dominant and showed 268 \nthe most significant trends; they were thus subtracted from that category and displayed 269 \nseparately in Figs. 5 and 6. A similar procedure was followed for Schulzospora. 270 \nThe most common palynomorph group is that of the forest mire. This group is made up 271 \nalmost entirely (>90%) of Lycospora pusilla which is unequivocally linked with the coal 272 \nswamp flora (Willard 1989; Willard et al. 1995). The forest mire in turn usually 273 \ncomprises more than 50% of each assemblage (Figs. 5 and 6). Forest mire palynomorphs 274 \ndecrease in number in low yielding limestones which - when palyniferous - yield small 275 \nfern spores, mainly Leiotriletes or Granulatisporites (Eble et al. 2001). Fern spores 276 \n 14\nadditionally tend to be common in the lower parts of coarsening-up cycles (e.g. 208 \u2013 205 277 \nm, 192.5 \u2013 190 m and 178-175 m in the Rowlands Gill Borehole) but dwindle in numbers 278 \nupsection. Colonisers and extrabasinal palynomorphs are rare throughout the section, and 279 \nseem not to have a pattern that can be related to cyclicity. Contrary to the concept of the 280 \n\u2018Neves Effect\u2019, extrabasinal palynomorphs do not peak during marine units. 281 \nSchulzospora tends, like fern spores, to be most common in the lower, marine parts of 282 \ncoarsening-up cycles; this is particularly evident in the Rowlands Gill Borehole (Fig. 6). 283 \nScolecodonts are most common in sections identified as marine on the basis of marine 284 \nmacrofossils, low \u03b413C, or high AOM, but limestones do not always yield them. The most 285 \ncommon palynofacies elements (Table 2) are AOM, black equant fragments and 286 \nphytoclasts, and these are strongly related to facies and cyclicity (Figs. 5 and 6). AOM 287 \noccurs most commonly in limestones or in sediments identified as marine on the basis of 288 \nmarine macrofossils, or at levels with low \u03b413C, while black equant fragments and 289 \nphytoclasts, most likely of terrestrial wood origin, are most common in sections without 290 \nmarine macrofossils. At a few horizons, low \u03b413C and AOM indicate marine conditions 291 \nthough marine macrofauna are not recorded, for example at 198 m in Rowlands Gill (Fig. 292 \n4), thus a combination of \u03b413C and AOM may be a valuable indicator of cryptic marine 293 \nhorizons. 294 \nInterpretation 295 \nFacies analysis suggests that the bulk of sediment between the Lower Felltop and Upper 296 \nFelltop limestones was deposited in a series of prograding delta lobes, probably related to 297 \na southward flowing river system sourced in Laurentia and Baltica (Waters & Davies 298 \n 15\n2006). However the three main limestones were deposited during major relative sea level 299 \nrises of several tens of metres, as suggested by the fauna (P. Brand, pers. comm. 2007), 300 \nand are correlated across the northeast of England, the Vale of Eden and the Midland 301 \nValley of Scotland (P. Brand, pers. comm. 2007; Ramsbottom et al. 1978). The age of the 302 \nlimestones and their widespread distribution over several tectonic blocks and basins 303 \nsuggests that the sea level rises are likely of glacioeustatic origin. Thinner, cryptic marine 304 \nhorizons marked by rare marine fauna, scolecodonts, low \u03b413C values or high amounts of 305 \nAOM, probably represent shallower, less persistent seas and are not uniquely identifiable 306 \npalaeontologically, thus it is not possible to verify their lateral extension beyond the 307 \nboreholes. They may have a variety of origins, including glacioeustacy, or may be related 308 \nto delta sedimentation processes. Small-scale cyclicity manifested by centimetre-scale 309 \nalternations between coals and thin marine horizons towards the top of coarsening 310 \nupward cycles, may have a similar variety of origins.  311 \nThe \u03b413C pattern in both sections (Figs 3 and 4) indicates that marine organic matter is 312 \nassociated with limestones and with beds with marine macrofossils. \u03b413C of microscopic 313 \nwood fragments from samples split and also analysed for \u03b413C (bulk) give substantially 314 \nthe same figures as \u03b413C (bulk). These samples were mainly unfossiliferous siltstone and 315 \nmudstone, rather than limestones which yielded too few 500-1000 \u00b5 wood fragments for 316 \nanalysis. The congruence of \u03b413C values between bulk organic matter and wood 317 \nfragments, and the lack of AOM in these samples suggests that the sediments were 318 \ndeposited in bodies of water that did not generate marine algal organic matter, though 319 \nthey were close enough to terrestrial environments to receive wood fragments. It seems 320 \n 16\nlikely, therefore, that they were deposited in an environment not conducive to marine 321 \norganisms, perhaps an interdistributary bay open to the sea, but with low salinity water. 322 \nThus, the distribution and thickness of low \u03b413C sections suggests that full salinity 323 \nconditions were relatively intermittent.  324 \nA possible explanation for this could lie in early Namurian palaeogeography where the 325 \nNorthumberland Trough lay within a complex lowland area amongst uplands or highs in 326 \ncentral Scotland, the Southern Uplands and Wales-Brabant (Cope et al. 1992; Waters & 327 \nDavies 2006). Only in the south, in the Central Province, was there permanent deep 328 \nwater. However, fresh river water entered from the north, discharged from large rivers 329 \n(Collinson 1988; Holdsworth & Collinson 1988), with high potential to reduce salinity, 330 \nparticularly after a certain amount of marine regression, perhaps past a step or barrier. 331 \nCollinson (1988) and Holdsworth & Collinson (1988) considered salinity to have varied 332 \nin a similar way in the Central Pennine Basin concluding that it was the chief control on 333 \nthe stratigraphical distribution of goniatites, and that the thick black mudstones between 334 \nmarine bands were deposited in low salinity conditions. A possible modern analogue for 335 \nthese palaeoenvironments is the narrow Strait of Malacca in SE Asia fringed by tropical 336 \nrainforests with very high rainfall and runoff, but very low erosion and sedimentation 337 \nrates due to extensive vegetation cover (Cecil et al. 1993). Salinity there is very low (two 338 \nthirds that of normal seawater) due to mixing of high river discharge, and marine biota is 339 \nrare over large areas of the basin (Cecil et al. 1993). 340 \nPalynology suggests that terrestrial plant palaeocommunities were similar to those of the 341 \nlater Namurian and early Westphalian. The progradational parts of the sequence, both 342 \n 17\ndistal (unfossiliferous low salinity mudstones) and proximal (mouthbar sandstone and 343 \ncoal), are dominated by Lycospora pusilla related to tree lycopsids (Willard 1989; 344 \nWillard et al. 1995), probably occupying coastal, perennially-flooded, swamps at various 345 \ndistances from the Throckley-Rowlands Gill area, depending on the extent of 346 \nprogradation. Non forest mire plants were present, probably consisting of less woody 347 \nherbaceous ferns, sphenopsids and progymnosperms, but the presence of other 348 \npalaeocommunities and their geographical position with respect to the swamp coastal 349 \nzone is more speculative, because few patterns are present in the data.  350 \nRepeated progradation and transgression appear to have produced a few consistent 351 \nchanges in the terrestrial plant palaeocommunities based on palynology. Fern spores and 352 \nSchulzospora appear to be more common in the lower parts of coarsening-upward cycles, 353 \nand there appears to be no increase in extrabasinal palynomorphs in marine sections 354 \n(\u2018Neves Effect\u2019). The trends in fern spores and Schulzospora are expressed in all the 355 \ncoarsening upward cycles that were densely sampled above the three major limestone 356 \nunits (Rowlands Gill, 208.36 - 203.64 m, 12 samples; 192.45 - 189.3 m, 7 samples: 357 \nThrockley 244.14 - 241.25 m, 5 samples). These short sections are abruptly regressive; 358 \nevidence from macrofauna, AOM and \u03b413C suggests very rapid reduction in salinity. 359 \nThough water depth for the lower parts of each cycle is difficult to estimate, it was 360 \nprobably much less than that during limestone deposition. The decrease in salinity 361 \nprobably resulted from the influence of rapidly advancing rivers.  362 \nThe allochthonous fern spores and Schulzospora may represent some aspect of the 363 \nterrestrial environment that is radically different from the normal forest mire-364 \n 18\ndominated palaeocommunity. Unlike the latter, ferns require a moist but dryland substrate 365 \nto establish the gametophyte, and therefore large numbers of ferns in such conditions may 366 \nbe indicative of low or descending water table, which is likely during marine regression. 367 \nThus, coastal areas or newly created dry land after regression may have been populated 368 \npreferentially by small ferns. Schulzospora was likely produced by a pteridosperm, an 369 \nextinct seed-producing, fern-like plant, allied or ancestral to the gymnosperms (Remy & 370 \nRemy 1955; Potoni\u00e9 1962; Ouyang 1996; Eble et al. 2001) and is similar in morphology 371 \nto simple conifer-like monosaccate pollen such as Potonieisporites and Caheniasaccites 372 \nin having an inflated sac-like extension around the central body. The pteridosperms are a 373 \ndiverse group and thus generalisations cannot be made about their palaeoecology, 374 \nhowever early and mid Mississippian pteridosperms appear to have been most common 375 \nin disturbed settings, including stream levees and drier parts of floodplains in North 376 \nAmerica, and in volcanigenic landscapes in western Europe (Rothwell & Scheckler 377 \n1988), and would have avoided standing water (DiMichele et al. 2006). Thus, like ferns, 378 \nthey represent a radically different palaeoecology to the forest mire. This, coupled with 379 \ntheir gymnospermous water-independent reproduction strategy made lowlands newly 380 \ncreated by regression with declining water table conditions ideal for pteridosperm 381 \ncolonisation.  382 \nThe fact that extrabasinal palynomorphs do not increase during marine intervals may be 383 \ndue to their extreme rarity in the lower parts of the Throckley and Rowlands Gill 384 \nboreholes, and in the early Namurian generally (Clayton et al. 1977), but even in the later 385 \nNamurian section of the Throckley Borehole, where extrabasinal palynomorphs are more 386 \n 19\ncommon, they are concentrated outside marine sections (Fig. 3). It is possible that what 387 \nare interpreted as extrabasinal plants, including upland habitats, had not yet taken up such 388 \na position and were still riverine or littoral, and therefore were affected in the same way 389 \nas lowland plants during transgression, preventing a \u2018Neves Effect\u2019. A strong fluvial 390 \ninfluence in the upper part of the Throckley Borehole is indicated by generally low bulk 391 \n\u03b413C, AOM and marine fossils, and the presence of large fluvial channel sandbodies (Fig. 392 \n3; Dunham 1990; Mills & Holliday 1998), thus it is also possible that fluvial runoff was 393 \nthe strongest source of \u2018extrabasinal palynomorphs\u2019 being brought from upland areas 394 \naround the basin, a phenomenon identified by Muller (1959) in studies of the distribution 395 \nof saccate pollen in the modern Orinoco delta. In the more distal settings in which the 396 \n\u2018Neves Effect\u2019 has been traditionally identified (Neves 1958; Davies & McLean 1996) 397 \nsuch an influence would not be so strong. 398 \nNotwithstanding fluvial effects, the main trend of extrabasinal palynomorphs is from very 399 \nlow numbers in the lower parts of both boreholes to higher numbers in the later 400 \nNamurian, probably reflecting increasing colonisation of habitats (Fig. 3). The most 401 \ncommon palynomorph of the extrabasinal group in the Throckley and Rowlands Gill 402 \nboreholes is Potonieisporites which appeared in the earliest Namurian E1 (basal 403 \nPendleian) in NW Europe (Clayton et al. 1990; Owens et al. 2004); a similar inception is 404 \nsuggested in the Rhadames Basin, Libya (Coquel et al. 1988), eastern Canada (Utting 405 \n1987), and Asia (Ouyang 1996). This apparently synchronous first appearance has 406 \nprompted the use of monosaccate pollen of Potonieisporites as a marker for the basal 407 \nNamurian worldwide (see for example Jones & Truswell 1992). Potonieisporites was 408 \n 20\nprobably pre-pollen in that it is unlikely to have germinated through a distal aperture 409 \n(Poort & Veld 1997; Rothwell & Mapes 2001; see also Zaviolova & Stephenson 2006), 410 \nbut it has been found in association with walchiacean conifer-like plants that had xeric 411 \nadaptations (Krassilov 1997; Poort & Veld 1997). The earliest macrofossil of this type is 412 \nof Wesphalian B age (Scott & Chaloner 1983), but it is likely that the early Namurian of 413 \nNE England, Scotland and parts of Northern Ireland supported walchiacean conifer-like 414 \nplants based on the presence of Potonieisporites (this study; Scott & Chaloner 1983; 415 \nWhitaker & Butterworth 1978). The origins of conifers such as the Walchiaceae are 416 \nrelated to pteridosperms and cordaites (Rothwell 1982), or gnetophytes (Hernandez-417 \nCastillo et al. 2001) and are interpreted to have evolved in xeric, seasonal environments 418 \n(Zhou 1994) or upland areas (Falcon-Lang & Scott 2000) capitalising on their water-419 \nindependent reproduction strategy. Their common appearance worldwide in greater 420 \nnumbers across several ecological zones in the latest Pennsylvanian and Early Permian in 421 \nthe Euramerican region (e.g. in the Autunian of France) is attributed to rapid aridification. 422 \nHowever since land plants were originally concentrated on river margins and close to 423 \ncoasts, it seems reasonable to suggest that the ancestors of the Walchiaceae group may 424 \nhave appeared in these areas and later spread to the uplands. Though cordaites have been 425 \nproposed as upland plants recently (Falcon-Lang 2006; Falcon-Lang & Scott 2000; 426 \nFalcon-Lang & Bashforth 2004), Krassilov (1997) suggested that a xeric aspect to 427 \nmorphology in cordaites and Walchiaceae may not always suggest an upland habitat, and 428 \nthat walchiacean coniferoids may have had xeric adaptations for intra-littoral 429 \nenvironments rather than upland environments. It is interesting to speculate about the 430 \nearly Namurian coincident appearance of walchiacean pollen and high frequency-high 431 \n 21\namplitude glacioeustatic cyclicity. Pfefferkorn et al. (2007) commented that in 432 \ngreenhouse to icehouse transitions, lowland areas are the sources of evolutionary 433 \ninnovation (the \u2018Havlena Effect\u2019). If the Walchiaceae evolved from pteridosperms, 434 \nperhaps xeric-adapted, intra-littoral lowland walchiacean coniferoids were encouraged to 435 \ndevelop by repeated appearance of low water-table ecospace following regression. These 436 \nmay have been connected with allopatric speciation related to dryland colonisation of 437 \npteridosperm Schulzospora-producing plants. 438 \nLarge scale trends 439 \nCyclic sedimentation appears to affect palaeoecology over short intervals, but overall, the 440 \nperiod of study indicates equilibrium, with palaeocommunities such as forest mire 441 \ncontinually re-establishing themselves after sea level changes. A similar pattern of 442 \nequilibrium is present in later sequences of the Westphalian (Falcon-Lang 2003, 2004; 443 \nDiMichele et al. 2002).  444 \nHowever a long term trend in Throckley and Rowlands Gill boreholes is increasing 445 \nterrestrial \u03b413C (Figs. 3 and 4). The trend was examined using bootstrap statistics (Efron 446 \n& Tibshirani 1993) whereby the slope of a linear fit to the regression line was calculated 447 \nfrom 10000 resamples of the depth\/ \u03b413C data pairs. The median and 95th percentile 448 \nconfidence limits on the slope (median value -0.00428, 95% confidence limits -0.00591 449 \nto -0.00294) indicate that the \u03b413C trend is significant. 450 \nThe extended record in the Throckley Borehole shows that the trend extends through 451 \nmuch of the Namurian up to the Kinderscoutian - Marsdenian KV palynological 452 \n 22\nbiozone. This trend is also mirrored in the lower parts of the boreholes by marine \u03b413C. 453 \n\u03b413C (terrestrial) has been documented through the Palaeozoic by Strauss & Peters-Kottig 454 \n(2003) and Peters-Kottig et al. (2006). These authors\u2019 values come from a large database 455 \nof samples and broadly show high values of terrestrial \u03b413C (\u201321\u2030 to \u201322\u2030)  between 456 \nthe early Mississippian and the Early Permian, attributed to the rise of large vascular land 457 \nplants and associated burial of carbon in decomposition resistant lignin. Within this 458 \nperiod, Strauss & Peters-Kottig (2003) and Peters-Kottig et al. (2006) also recognised a 459 \nperiod of relatively low values corresponding to the late Mississippian and Pennsylvanian 460 \n(\u201322\u2030 to \u201324\u2030), and these were attributed to the physiological response of plants to 461 \nhigh atmospheric O2 concentrations at that time (Berner 2003), in that increased 462 \nphotorespiration due to enhanced O2 lead to increased carbon isotope fractionation and 463 \ndecreased \u03b413C. Within the period of depressed values is a long, low-gradient increasing 464 \ntrend that extends from the late Mississippian through the Pennsylvanian (Strauss & 465 \nPeters-Kottig 2003, fig. 3; Peters-Kottig et al. 2006, fig. 1). 466 \nThe trend in the Throckley and Rowlands Gill boreholes is from c. \u201324\u2030 (Pendleian-467 \nArnsbergian, c.327 Ma) to c. \u201322\u2030 (late Alportian - ?early Marsdenian, c.323 Ma; 468 \nnumerical dates from Waters & Davies 2006: Figs. 3 and 4), and thus is similar to the 469 \nMississippian-Pennsylvanian transition recorded by Strauss & Peters-Kottig (2003) and 470 \nPeters-Kottig et al. (2006). We suggest that this trend probably records global variation 471 \nbecause it occurs in both boreholes and because the data come from a random collection 472 \nof mainly wood fragments at each sampled stratigraphic level and thus are unlikely to be 473 \nsubject to systematic bias or to extreme individual results from unusual habitats. In 474 \n 23\naddition, if the marine and terrestrial realm behave in a linked fashion when responding 475 \nto global carbon cycle changes as suggested by Strauss & Peters-Kottig (2003), then the 476 \ncongruent trend in marine \u03b413C (Figs. 3 and 4) supports the veracity of the \u03b413C terrestrial 477 \nincreasing trend. Maturation is known to have minor effects on \u03b413C in wood (van Bergen 478 \n& Poole 2002), but maturation differences between and through the two boreholes are 479 \nnegligible based on palynomorph exine colour. The trend is also unlikely to be related to 480 \na change in wood type (e.g. from lycopsid wood to gymnosperm wood upsection) 481 \nbecause wood types are not known to vary systemically in \u03b413C in this way. 482 \nThe increasing trend in the Throckley and Rowlands Gill boreholes is, however, difficult 483 \nto explain. If the depressed values of \u03b413C in the late Mississippian and Pennsylvanian are 484 \nrelated to high atmospheric O2, as suggested by Strauss & Peters-Kottig (2003) and 485 \nPeters-Kottig et al. (2006), then a small increase in \u03b413C upsection might relate to 486 \ndecreases in atmospheric O2. However Berner (2003) suggested increasing atmospheric 487 \nO2 until the Late Permian. 488 \nIt is tempting to explain the trend in terms of glaciation since the early Namurian 489 \nThrockley and Rowlands Gill sequences are approximately coeval with the earliest 490 \nCarboniferous unequivocal glacial facies in South America, eastern Australia and Tibet 491 \n(see Isbell et al. 2003; Gonz\u00e1lez-Bonorino & Eyles 1995; Fielding et al. 2008). For 492 \nexample the onset of the first Australian (C1) glaciation of Fielding et al. (2008) is dated 493 \nat approximately 326.5-325.5 Ma (earliest Namurian, Pendleian). However the onset of 494 \nlarge-scale glaciation would tend to decrease carbon burial and therefore produce a 495 \ndecreasing \u03b413C trend. A glacially-related mechanism that might produce an increasing 496 \n 24\ntrend could be minor atmospheric O2 decrease due to decreased plant growth leading to 497 \nincreasing \u03b413C. 498 \nConclusions 499 \nThis study has shown that high amplitude - high frequency cycles, most likely of 500 \nglacioeustatic origin, produced repeated responses in terrestrial plant groups including 501 \nferns and putative pteridosperms, probably due to changing sea level. There may also be 502 \na theoretical connection between cyclicity and the appearance of monosaccate pollen 503 \nsuch as Potonieisporites. It also illustrates the value of \u03b413C (bulk organic matter) in 504 \ndelineating marine and non marine conditions due to the large difference between \u03b413C 505 \nmarine organic matter (c.\u201330\u2030) and \u03b413C terrestrial (c.\u201323\u2030) and indicates that 506 \nintermittent full marine salinity conditions resulting from glacioeustatic marine 507 \ntransgression were superimposed on a background of constant inundation by freshwater 508 \nfrom the north by large rivers, which killed off the marine biota. Long term terrestrial and 509 \nmarine increasing \u03b413C (organic) may reflect the onset of major glaciation in Gondwana, 510 \nsince there is some evidence to suggest that the two are coeval, but no specific 511 \nmechanism can be suggested to link the trends. 512 \n 513 \nJane Flint is thanked for careful palynological processing and Joanne Green for some of 514 \nthe \u03b413C analysis.
