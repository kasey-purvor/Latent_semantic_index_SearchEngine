There it is noted that, if the debtor is aware of the constraints impose by sustainability while the creditor is not, the former may have an incentive to make a low offer leading to delay in order to act as a signal to the creditor (that sustainability is a serious cause for concern). On this reasoning, the Argentine government would not have expected creditors to accept the offer made at Dubai in 2003; but the final settlement reached in 2005 - broadly in line with Argentina\u2019s sustainability guidelines - would reflect a successful signalling strategy by the President and his finance minister. The observed delay and the write down are, it seems, broadly consistent with a bargaining approach. Moreover, according to Porzecanski (2005), the fall of the currency rendered the government insolvent because of the large debts contracted by previous administrations. He notes in his introduction that \u201c[a] sinking currency rendered the government instantly insolvent; the net government debt, which at the one peso per dollar exchange rate was equivalent to three times tax revenues and 50% of GDP, virtually tripled once the currency sank to around three pesos per dollar, becoming unaffordable to service\u201d: and he also observes that policy prior to 2002 involved the authorities then in power \u201cbetting the ranch\u201d by borrowing almost exclusively in dollars and other foreign currencies to finance a string of budgetary deficits, even though their revenues were due and collected only in pesos. (Porzecanski, 2005). If Argentina was insolvent for reasons to do with previous administrations, why should it be treated as a rogue debtor? In our view, it all depends on how creditors outside the swap are dealt with. The bargaining model assumes that all creditors get parity of treatment (as they might with under CACs). So far, however, those outside the swap have received nothing. How the sovereign might deal with the holdouts so as to avoid been treated as rogue debtor is discussed in section 4 of the paper.","cites":null},{"id":8677191,"title":"1998b \u201cThe Collective Representation Clause.\u201d International Financial Law Review17(9):9. 20 ____________ .","authors":[],"date":"1999","doi":null,"raw":"____________   . 1998b \u201cThe Collective Representation Clause.\u201d International Financial Law Review17(9):9.   20 ____________   . 1999. \u201cA Lawyer\u2019s Perspective on the New International Financial Architecture.\u201d  Journal of International Banking Law and Regulation 14(7):225-229.","cites":null},{"id":8677221,"title":"2004a \u201cAre there such things as international property rights?\u201d, The World Economy,","authors":[],"date":null,"doi":"10.1111\/j.1467-9701.2004.00604.x","raw":"Sgard Jerome. 2004a \u201cAre there such things as international property rights?\u201d, The World Economy, 27:3, March.","cites":null},{"id":8677210,"title":"A New Approach to Sovereign Debt Restructuring.

In this spirit, Dhillon et al. 2006 apply a bargaining approach to explain both the final settlement and the delay in achieving it, assuming implicitly that the court is holding the ring. The authors follow the approach of Merlo and Wilson (1998) where the size of the pie is uncertain and \u2018efficient delay\u2019 can occur as creditor and debtor wait for economic recovery - fearing that early settlement will lock in the recession. (The Rubinstein model of alternating offers, applied to sovereign debt negotiations by Bulow and Rogoff (1989), is not used because it predicts prompt settlement.) Based on the creditor response to the initial Argentine offer at Dubai in 2003 Dhillon et al. (2006) estimate that the \u201cpie\u201d to be divided between debtor and creditors was worth almost 3% of GDP. Allowing for the \u201cfirst mover\u201d advantage for the debtor as proposer, the bargaining model implies that creditors receive a little under half the pie. On this basis, the predicted recovery rate on debt without interest is 41 cents \u2013 a little better than the final settlement (estimated to be worth about 34 cents in Table 2). As for the prolonged delay, the authors note that political factors played a critical role until 2003 when President Duhalde \u2013 appointed earlier by Congress as interim officeholder \u2013 was replaced by President Kirchner after a general election. Because the expected annual rate of economic recovery in 2003 exceeded the time rate of discount 12, it is claimed that further postponement was economically \u2018efficient\u2019.

But the IMF \nproposal for a new Sovereign Debt Restructuring Mechanism (Krueger, 2003) to tackle \nthe issue found little favour with creditors or debtors and this left the US Treasury-\nbacked initiative for putting Collective Action Clauses (CACs) into sovereign bond \ncontracts as the preferred alternative.  \n \nWhen in 2005 Argentina successfully restructured the majority of its defaulted foreign \ndebt, this was neither mediated by the IMF, nor assisted by clauses to promote creditor \ncoordination. It was effected by a take-it-or-leave-it offer from the debtor, accepted by a \nsupermajority of bondholders despite the substantial \u2018haircut\u2019 involved.2 It is our \ncontention that the US courts played a major role in promoting the swap; and will \nprobably continue to do so in future debt restructurings. In this paper we give an \naccount of how the process of \u201cjudge-mediated\u201d debt restructuring has operated in this \ncase; and we speculate on future developments.  \n \nTo some observers, the size of the write-down involved in the Argentine case suggests \nthat \u201crogue debtors, rather than rogue creditors, are the ones that pose the greatest threat \nto the integrity and efficiency of the international financial architecture,\u201d Porzecanski \n(2005, p.331). Despite the waiving of sovereign immunity, it is argued, \u201cthe fact \nremains that it is exceedingly difficult to collect from a sovereign deadbeat [and] the sad \ntruth is that only other governments\u2026can hope to rein in a wayward sovereign debtor \nand persuade it not to walk away from its lawful obligations.\u201d  \n \nOthers take a more optimistic view: for Sturzenegger and Zettelmeyer (2005c, p.10) the \nArgentine swap was \u201cin most dimensions a textbook example of how to do an \nexchange\u201d. In reviewing recent litigation in international debt markets, however, they \n                                                 \n1 These include vulture funds who buy distressed debt in default and sue for payment in full, Fisch and \nGentile (2004). \n2 Creditors who enter the swap suffered a loss of about two thirds in the face value of their bonds; those \nwho did not have, so far, received nothing from Argentina in more than a year after the swap. \n 3\nfound no evidence that sanctions on trade and payments have been imposed in an \neffective way. Recent developments, they argue, provide support for the assumption \nmade in the seminal paper by Eaton and Gersovitz (1981): that while \u201ccreditors cannot \nimpose any sanction on defaulting countries, they can hinder its access to international \ncapital markets\u201d, Sturzenegger and Zettelmeyer (2005b, pp.7, 51).  \n \nCareful examination of the Argentine debt swap of 2005 leads us to challenge both \nviews. While Porzecanski concludes that the courts are irrelevant, we note that the \njudge appears to have exploited creditor heterogeneity \u2013 between holdouts seeking \ncapital gains and institutional investors wanting a settlement, in particular  \u2013 first to \nachieve a swap and then to protect creditor rights. Likewise, the simple dichotomy \nbetween sanctions and reputation proposed by  Sturzenegger and Zettelmeyer (as the \nonly mechanisms to ensure a successful swap) misses a key factor: namely judicial \nintervention. \n \nOur analysis of the opinions and orders of Judge Griesa\u2019s court suggests four distinct \nphases of judge-mediated debt restructuring. First comes the engagement of the debtor: \nthe Judge finds in favour of holdouts in order to encourage the debtor to make an offer. \nSecond is promoting the swap: he refuses enforcement long enough to promote a \nsuccessful debt swap. Third threatening attachment: once the swap has been accepted \nby a supermajority, it is time for the courts to threaten the debtor with enforcement \n(effectively denying it access to primary capital markets). Finally, direct mediation: at \nthe same time as the judge threatens attachment, he is willing to resolve disagreements \nbetween some holdouts, e.g. retail investors, and the debtor to settle outstanding claims. \nCurrently, the last two phases prevail simultaneously.  \n \nIn their discussion of sovereign debt restructuring, Fisch and Gentile (2004) emphasise \nthe role of holdout litigation in the enforcement of sovereign obligations. We too see \ncreditor litigation continuing to be important: but only in the period of transition to \nCACs do we consider that vultures play a pivotal role. In a future where CACs are \nwidespread, it may well be litigation by an ex ante Creditor Committees that triggers the \ndebtor to come up with an offer. \n \n 4\nThe paper is organised as follows: section 1 briefly reviews the literature on why  \nsovereigns pay and indicates where our analysis fits in. In the next section we outline \nthe salient features of the Argentine case (with discussion of a bargaining interpretation \nof the swap in an Appendix) and discuss a bargaining interpretation of the swap, section \n2. The next two sections, 3 and 4, analyse the opinions and decisions of the New York \ncourts: encouraging the debtor to make the first offer (in Dubai, September 2003); \npromoting the ensuing debt restructuring process (from Dubai to the final offer in \nMarch 2005); and acting to help resolve the holdout problem. Section 5 indicates how \nthe widespread adoption of CACs will reduce the role of vultures in future and sketches \nthe role that courts and creditor committees will play. The last section concludes. \n \n1. Why do sovereigns pay? \n \nHow does the analysis in this paper relate to the existing literature on the incentives for \nsovereigns to repay debt? What role have these incentives played in the Argentine case? \nThe academic literature has stressed the role of \u2018direct\u2019 sanctions, \u2018policy conditionality\u2019 \nand \u2018reputational\u2019 sanctions imposed by creditors, as indicated in Table 3, lines 1 to 3a. \nBut such mechanisms played a minor role in the Argentine case: they were \u201cthe dogs \nthat did not bark\u201d, to make an analogy with Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s The Hound of the \nBaskervilles. Before outlining the role of the courts in helping to achieve the swap (see \nline 3(b) of the table), we discuss in more detail the failure of the other mechanisms. \n 5\nTable 1.

Fisch and Gentile (2004), Miller and Thomas (this paper) \n \n 6\nSanctions \nThe use of direct military threats to enforce debt contracts may have been relevant in the \nnineteenth century when \u2018gunboat diplomacy\u2019 was common, but not now: WTO rules \nprohibit trade intervention for purposes of debt collection, and seizures not authorised \nby a court are, by definition, illegal. But as capital markets have become increasingly \nglobalised, the waiving of sovereign immunity \u2013 often required as a precondition for \nissuing debt in London or New York \u2013 has allowed for the attachment of collateral \nassets under court procedures: specialist vulture funds have developed litigation \nstrategies to exploit these possibilities. In the case of Argentina, however, efforts by \nholdout creditors to attach assets have been a failure, as indicated in the last column of \nTable 1.  \nAnother feature of modern capital markets is the ease with which creditors can exit; so \nsovereign debtors are exposed to creditor panic with associated financial and exchange \nrate crises, Ghosal and Miller (2002). Reducing or avoiding the output losses that can be \ntriggered by capital flight is now regarded as a strong incentive for sovereigns to honour \ntheir debts, as the references in note (2) to the Table make clear.3 In the Argentine case, \nsevere output losses have of course occurred but \u2013 since default was widely anticipated \n\u2013 they ensued well before default: and, while the debt was being restructured, recovery \ngot well under way. (A sanction that could have played a role in this case is the denial \nof trade credit, a device commonly used to put pressure on defaulting sovereigns, \nKohlscheen and O\u2019Connell, 2003).  \nPolicy conditionality \nSince the IMF policy of \u2018lending into arrears\u2019 initiated during the Latin American debt \ncrises of the 1980s, the Fund has had to insist on explicit policy conditionality to avoid  \nundermining debtors incentives to repay. Signing the Letter of Intent that embodies such \nconditions is a precondition for obtaining IMF programme assistance. In the cases of \nKorea in 1997 and Brazil in 2002, indeed, prospective presidents were persuaded to \nendorse targets for fiscal prudence before elections took place, an illustration of the loss \n                                                 \n3 As with bank-runs there is a risk of self-fulfilling crisis occurring: schemes to reduce this risk include \nCohen and Portes (2004) and Cordella and Levy-Yeyati (2005). \n 7\nof sovereignty mentioned in the Table. Conditions for rolling over IMF lending to \nArgentina after default did include the requirement that steps be taken to settle with \nholdout creditors: but, for the IMF, Argentina was effectively \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d; and in \nany case it freed itself from any such policy conditionality by early repayment of all its \nborrowing in 2006. Kaletsky (1985) stresses the role of international pressure from G7, \nbut this does not seem to have played an important part in the Argentine case. \nMarket access \nAn alternative incentive to repay debts would be fear of losing reputation, with \nconsequent widening of the bonds spread from normal junk bond levels4 to what might \nbe described as rogue-debt levels. Despite Porzecanski\u2019s characterisation, this does not \nappear to be the case for Argentina \u2013 where spreads are close to those of Brazil. Kletzer \nand Wright (2000) analyse a self-enforcing mechanism \u2013 \u2018cheat the cheater\u2019 \u2013 that could \nsustain equilibrium in debt markets with a limited number of creditors, see Table 1, line \n3a.5 Their analysis, however, is explicitly related to bank lending as in the original \nEaton and Gersovitz (1981) paper: how, if at all, it might be extended to a world of \nanonymous bondholders is unclear. \nThe argument of this paper is that the courts have played a key role in the Argentine \ncase: initially by threatening the debtor with attachments to prompt a credible offer, and \nreining in the holdouts to promote the swap. After the successful swap, the threat of \nattachment has effectively denied the debtor access to primary capital markets, namely \nLondon and New York. As indicated in line 3(b) of Table 1, denial of access to these \nmarkets is one way of pressuring a defaulting debtor to settle pending claims against it. \nBy undertaking to resolve disagreements between the debtor and holdouts, the court \nalso provides a mechanism to ensure successful settlements.  \nWe conclude that whatever pressure there is on Argentina to finalise the swap it is not \ncoming from self-enforcing reputation mechanisms which operate in an institutional \nvacuum as suggested by Kletzer and Wright. Court denial of access to New York for the \nissue of new bonds may not impose immediate hardship on the country or its finances: \n                                                 \n4 As it is prone to restructuring, corporate debt in the US is often referred to as junk bonds. \n5 It should be noted, however, that not only Venezuela but also New York banks are happily lending into \nserious arrears by Argentina : is this consistent with the Kletzer\/ Wright equilibrium? \n 8\nbut it is surely not credible that a middle-income country like Argentina will wish \nforever to be excluded from the leading capital markets of the world.  \n \n \n2. Key aspects of the Argentine debt restructuring  \n \nThe Argentine case is notable for being the largest-ever sovereign debt default and for \nbeing conducted without decisive intervention by international institutions. Before \nproviding our account of role of the US courts in this case, four salient features of the \nArgentine swap may be discussed with the aid of Table 2: namely, the heterogeneity of \ncreditors groups, the absence of creditor coordination, the size of the write down, and \nthe long delay before it was accepted. \n \nTable 2.

C. Porzecanski\u2019s calculations.\n 9\n(i) Pronounced creditor heterogeneity \n \nArgentine debt in default contained a significantly higher number of bond issues than all \nthe other cases listed in the table: it involved many thousands of creditors in eight \ndifferent legal jurisdictions. The sheer numbers posed a major obstacle to effecting a \nswap. Perhaps more significant, however, were the conflicting incentives affecting \ndifferent groups.  \n \nAs Fisch and Gentile (2004, p.26) note \u2018[o]nly certain large institutional investors, \nparticularly commercial banks and investment banks have ongoing relationships with \nthe sovereign debtors\u2026 [this] may drive these institutional investors to support \nrestructuring plans that are unlikely to be acceptable to smaller investors, notably retail \ninvestors, who do not expect to gain from future transactions\u2026\u2019 In addition, there are a \nspecialised class of holdout litigants popularly known as \u2018vulture funds\u2019 who purchase \ndistressed debt at substantial discounts and seek capital gains either through the \nrestructuring process or by holding out and seeking additional payments from the \ndebtors. (The 24% creditors still holding defaulted Argentine bonds include both \nvultures and retail investors.) \n \n(ii)Absence of creditor co-ordination  \n \nDue in part to the aggressive negotiating stance taken by the sovereign, Argentina\u2019s \ncreditors participated in the swap in the absence of either formal or informal creditor \norganisations. One exception was the short-lived Global Committee of Argentine \nBondholders (GCAB). The GCAB was set up in 2003 to pool negotiating leverage and \ndemand a better deal claiming to represent US, European and Japanese creditors holding \nabout $40 million. But at the time of the swap, the GCAB had lost most of its \ninstitutional constituents and a majority tendered in the exchange. This attempt at \ncreditor organisation failed as each seemed to act in their own self-interest and took the \nopportunity to cut their losses and make short-term gains, Gelpern (2005).   \n \n 10\n(iii) Significant debt write-down \n \nOn a total outstanding principal of $81.8 billion, the Argentine swap involved a 66.3% \n\u2018haircut\u2019 (column 1). This is considerably larger than the other haircuts shown, namely \n40% for Ecuador and 37.5% for Russia: whether it is consistent with bargaining theory \nwe consider in the Appendix. The 76% participation rate in the swap is by far the lowest \nshown and implies that Argentina is still in default with 24% of its creditors by value.  \n \n(iv) Long Delay \n \nIt took over three years for Argentina to restructure its debt \u2013 more than twice as long as \nit took Russia for example. In part, the reasons were political, as the interim \nadministration of President Duhalde had no mandate to negotiate a swap. Economic \nreasons for delay are also analysed in the Appendix. \n \n \n3. Judge-mediated debt restructuring: from default to swap  \n \nHistorical precedents \n \nIn 1976, the US (and, soon after, the UK) imposed statutory constraints on absolute \nsovereign immunity from suit in foreign courts, Buchheit (1995). In the two decades \nthat followed, creditors developed innovative litigation strategies to maximise the \nbenefits of restricted sovereign immunity. In the absence of statutory regulation of \nsovereign debt, however, the litigation strategies have had mixed results - with common \nlaw decisions influenced by the political and economic conditions in which the \nlitigations were pursued.  \n \nEven in the absence of enforcement, restricted sovereign immunity has significantly \nimproved the leverage of creditors in the restructuring process. In the case Elliot & \nAssociates v. Banco de La Naci\u00f3n (Per\u00fa) decided in 1999, for example, the claimants \nwere vulture funds who threatened the debtor with enforcement and consequent delay of \nthe imminent swap: the debtor settled their claims out of court to avoid this outcome. \nSimilarly, in the case Elliot & Associates v. Panam\u00e1 decided in 1997, the threat of \n 11\nenforcement would have interfered with a new bond issue and consequently impaired \nPanama\u2019s ability to access capital markets. Again, the case was settled out of court, in \nfavour of the vultures.  \n \nMoreover, in the case Pravin Banker v. Banco Popular del Per\u00fa decided in 1997, the \ncourt went as far as to lay down the guidelines that they would follow in sovereign \nlitigation. The first guideline was to encourage orderly debt restructuring initiatives that \ninvolved the use of Brady bonds. The second guideline was to ensure the enforcement \nof contracts executed between American investors and sovereign debtors. In line with \nU.S. foreign policy at the time, in most cases the second guideline dominates the first: \nthus in a situation where ongoing debt- restructuring negotiations were at the cost of the \nclaims of U.S. creditors, the courts were bound to concede to the latter.   \n \nThe court\u2019s role in the Argentine swap \n \nThe Argentine swap was successfully concluded against the backdrop of over 200 law \nsuits \u2013 (including 15 class action suits) filed in New York, Italy and Germany. How was \nthis achieved? We believe that in large part it was due to mediation by the judge; and in \nTable 3 we summarise the actions taken by Judge Griesa to promote restructuring.   \n \nTable 3. Judge Griesa\u2019s Actions to Promote Restructurings \n \nEvent In favour of holdout \ncreditors  \nIn favour of restructuring \nRush to court house Summary judgements  in favour of creditors Stays execution \nClass action to \ncoordinate creditors Accepts in principle   \n\u2022 encourages tighter \ndefinition of a \u2018class\u2019 \n\u2022 keeps pari passu pending \nGrab race: \n for old bonds \nOrders creditor attachment \n(of Argentina\u2019s right to \nreceive old bonds) \nOrder to attach overturned in \nview of its negative impact on \nthe ongoing swap \nGrab race: \n for new issues  \nMaintains the threat of \nenforcement   \n \n \nColumn one describes the events, while columns two and three distinguish court orders \non the basis of whether Judge Griesa favours the holdout creditors or promotes the \n 12\nrestructuring. In the first instance (row one), the creditors who \u201crush to court\u201d on the \nelection of President Kirchner, successfully obtain summary judgements: Judge Griesa \nhas no option but to allow such claims [e.g. E.M.LTD v. The Republic of Argentina (12 \nSept. 2003)] (column two). This is only part of the story, however, as successful \nclaimants have to enforce their judgements against the debtor by attaching its assets. \nThis is where Judge Griesa exercises his discretion, dismissing pleas to attach specific \nassets of the debtor (final column). \n \nIn addition in 2003, relatively early on in the debt restructuring process, the creditors \nseek to certify class action suits (row two). Judge Griesa accepts certain claims \nencouraging creditor coordination [H.W.Urban GMBh v. Republic of Argentina (30 \nDec. 2003)] (column two).  However, in his orders rejecting some class action suits, \n[e.g. Alan Applestein TTEE v. The Republic of Argentina (May 12, 2003)], he \nencourages tighter definition of class: he also keeps pari passu pending6 (column three). \n \nIn the context of the class action suits, Judge Griesa\u2019s observations (obiter dicta) are \ninstructive.  At one point, he observes that \nan important channel for attempting to resolve the Argentine debt problem will \nundoubtedly be the effort to negotiate a debt restructuring plan.\u2019 He continues: \u2018judging \nfrom past national debt crises, these negotiations will be carried on largely, if not entirely \nby debt holders who do not choose to engage in litigation. To the extent that the other debt \nholders whether few or many wish to pursue litigation, the litigation should be well defined \nand its participants should be reasonably identifiable. One reason for this is that those \ninvolved in the debt restructuring process should have a clear idea of who has chosen \nlitigation and thus may not be candidates for participation in a voluntary restructuring plan.  \n \n \nIn early 2005, just before completion, the vultures attempt to stymie the swap. In the \nfirst instance, they succeed in their bid to obtain an order to attach the contractual right \nof the debtor to receive old bonds [NML Capital Ltd. v. The Republic of Argentina (13 \nMar. 2005)]. In response to Argentina\u2019s submission that this would make it abort the \nswap, Judge Griesa overturns his own judgement. In contrast with precedent, the Judge \nis motivated by a concern to promote restructuring and not only to enforce the claims of \n                                                 \n6 With the US administration supporting Argentina\u2019s reading of the clause, see Miller and Thomas (2006, \nAppendix). \n 13\nholdout litigants. Judge Griesa\u2019s decision is affirmed by the Second Circuit who find \n\u2018[t]hat restructuring is obviously of critical importance to the economic health of the \nnation.\u2019 The findings (in the decisions to vacate the attachment orders) assure the \ncreditors who may wish to participate in the swap that the court will ensure its \nsuccessful conclusion. \n \nChart 1 illustrates this process of Judge-mediated debt-restructuring, with the events \ndescribed above summarised in the upper part of the Chart. Following default by the \ndebtor, the court grants summary judgements in favour of holdout creditors as a means \nto prompt the debtor to make an offer. Then, in marked contrast to precedent, Judge \nGriesa reins the holdout creditors in so as to promote a settlement. The Judge is \nconcerned with the reasonableness of the swap and the percentage of creditors who \nconsent to the amendment. Finally the offer is accepted by a Super Majority Vote \n(SMV) but this leaves a fraction of creditors outside the swap -- and there are no CACs \nto ensure their compliance. (This leads to the next phase, the post-swap outcomes \nanalysed in the next section.) \n \nTwo particular aspects of this process are worth highlighting. First, that Judge Griesa \neffectively aggregates across creditors in the swap by treating the debt as a consolidated \nwhole; second, he keeps the claims of the holdouts distinct from those of creditors \ninvolved in the ongoing swap. \n 14\nChart 1 Judge-mediated debt restructuring \n \nof\nfe\nr r\nev\nis\ned\n   \n  C\nre\ndi\nto\nr h\nol\ndo\nut\n li\ngi\nta\ntio\nn\nC\nou\nrt \ngr\nan\nts\n s\num\nm\nar\ny \nju\ndg\nem\nen\nt b\nut\n d\nen\nie\ns \nen\nfo\nrc\nem\nen\nt\nO\nffe\nr r\nej\nec\nte\nd\n'R\nog\nue\n d\neb\nto\nr' \nin\ncu\nrs\nre\npu\nta\ntio\nna\nl \n D\nef\nau\nlt \nby\n D\neb\nto\nr\nD\neb\nto\nr m\nak\nes\n o\nffe\nr\n   \n   \n N\no \nla\nte\n o\nffe\nr o\nf s\nw\nap\nD\nire\nct\n m\ned\nia\ntio\nn\nby\n th\ne \nco\nur\nts\nO\nffe\nr a\ncc\nep\nte\nd \nby\n S\nM\nV\n:v\nul\ntu\nre\ns \nan\nd \nre\nta\nil \nin\nve\nst\nor\ns \nho\nld\n o\nut\nV\nul\ntu\nre\ns \n th\nre\nat\nen\n to\n a\ntta\nch\n n\new\n is\nsu\nes\n \nde\nny\nin\ng \nD\neb\nto\nr p\nrim\nar\ny \nm\nar\nke\nt a\ncc\nes\ns\nR\net\nai\nl i\nnv\nes\nto\nrs\n a\ncc\nep\nt\nLa\nte\n o\nffe\nr o\nf s\nw\nap\n fo\nr h\nol\ndo\nut\ns\nD\neb\nto\nr a\nvo\nid\ns \nre\npu\nta\ntio\nna\nl s\nan\nct\nio\nns\n( v\nul\ntu\nre\ns \nco\nnt\nin\nue\n to\n h\nol\ndo\nut\n)\nE V E N T S S O F A R T H E F U T U R E\n 15\n 4. Judge-mediated debt restructuring: a speculative analysis of post-\nswap outcomes  \n \nSo far, the post-swap phase of Argentine bond litigation has involved unsuccessful \nattempts by professional holdouts to attach the assets of the sovereign and forthright \ndenials by the debtor of any compensation for creditors outside the swap. For \nPorzecanski (2005), the latter constitutes the actions of a \u2018rogue debtor\u2019 \u2013 defined as a \nsovereign who can pick and choose the claims it wishes to satisfy and ignore the rest. \nThis pessimistic assessment of the situation is not borne out by low post-swap, \nsovereign spreads paid by the debtor in secondary markets for its existing debt i.e. the \nmarket does not appear to share Porzecanski\u2019s dire predictions (Sturzenegger and  \nZettelmeyer, 2005c, p.10). Our view of post-swap developments is more nuanced: what \nwe observe are judge-mediated efforts to complete the swap in the absence of CACs. \n \nThe lower part of Chart 1 indicates future developments, sketching two possible \noutcomes - other than the \u2018rogue-debtor\u2019 scenario. First on the far left, the debtor makes \na late offer of a swap (consistent with the \u201cmost-favoured-creditor\u201d commitment made \nto those who accepted the swap). We reckon that this is highly likely to be accepted by \nretail investors since the bonds involved in the swap have increased substantially in \nvalue. In the interests of their reputation, however, vultures may not be inclined to \naccept a haircut of two thirds; and they have the patience and skill to holdout for years \ntrying to prevent Argentina from accessing primary capital markets. But once a late \noffer is accepted by other holdouts, it is doubtful that vultures alone can continue to \ndeny a debtor access to primary capital markets (for historical evidence see Esteves, \n2005). \n \nShould Argentina chooses not to make a late offer, it maybe forced to accept direct \nmediation by the courts (as shown in the centre of Chart 1): in an unprecedented \ndevelopment, Judge Griesa has indicated the court\u2019s willingness to mediate a settlement \ndirectly should this prove necessary to complete the swap. Specifically, in one of many \nsimilar summary judgements [Vanina Andrea EXPOSITO  v. The Republic of Argentina \n(17 Feb. 2006)] he directs that \n \n 16\n Judgement will be entered for the principal amount of the bonds plus accrued \ninterest. The parties shall consult with one another concerning the form of the judgement \nand the amounts of interest that should be awarded in the judgement. If the parties are \nunable to reach an agreement on those subjects, they shall jointly submit an agreed \nproposed judgement to the court. If the parties are unable to reach agreement on those \nsubjects, plaintiff shall submit a proposed judgement to the court, and the Republic shall \nsubmit any objections to plaintiff\u2019s proposed judgement within five business days \nthereafter. The court will then resolve any remaining disagreements.  \n \nAs indicated above, the holdouts are a heterogeneous group with vultures and retail \ninvestors motivated by different incentives. With direct mediation by the courts, \nholdouts now have the option of submitting their claims to the court and possibly \nobtaining what the other participants obtained in the swap: this may be the way for retail \ninvestors to settle their claims, Porzecanski (2005). Ironically, judicial enforcement \u2013\nwith its lack of voluntariness \u2013 might free Argentina from its \u2018most favoured creditor\u2019 \ncommitment to those in the swap7: the debtor can be seen to have had no choice but to \naccede to holdout (especially vulture) claims. But these sequences of events will be time \nconsuming and uncertain: it may be designed as a threat to persuade the debtor \nvoluntarily to make a late offer as discussed above. \n \n \n5.  CACs, courts and creditor committees  \n \nWe have emphasised the role that courts (prompted by holdout litigation) have played, \nand are still playing, in the orderly resolution of a major sovereign debt crisis. Study of \nthe opinions and orders of Judge Griesa\u2019s court suggests three distinct judicial functions \n\u2013 encouraging the debtor to make an offer, promoting a successful debt swap and \nfinally dealing with holdouts \u2013 which together protect creditor rights. But the new \nbonds include CACs, as is now common with new issues of sovereign debt. The future, \nit seems, belongs to CACs. How will this affect the role of holdouts and of the courts?  \n \n                                                 \n7 The \u2018most favoured creditor\u2019 clause (MFC) clause \u2026 sought to assure participating creditors that \nholdout would not get a better deal. (Gelpern, 2005, p 5) \n 17\nPromoting the swap and handling holdouts \n \nGiven that CACs are designed to reduce the profit opportunities available to holdouts, it \nshould make it easier for creditors to organise a swap, with a SMV requirement of 75% \nas the industry standard. As the IMF has warned, however, aggregation will remain a \nproblem: the clauses only operate within a single bond issue, Krueger (2002). The judge \nin the Argentine case viewed the debt as a consolidated whole thereby effectively \naggregating a majority of the creditors (76%) that participated in the swap. Despite the \nrequirement for unanimity in the bond contracts, the courts promoted a swap influenced \nby economic, political and financial factors at the time. Similar action may be called for \nin future. With CACs, however, the issue of recalcitrant holdouts should disappear. \nSubject to the necessary majority for a swap, the holdouts will be impelled to accept the \nsame terms. They cannot hold out for better.  \n \nWhile CACs and courts may well solve aggregation and resolve the holdout problem, \nthis will not necessarily prompt the debtor into making an offer. Vultures may not have \nthe incentive to initiate debtor engagement but existing creditors will, as we explain in \nthe next section. \n \nDebtor engagement: Class action suits and bondholder organisation \n \nThe historical record provides evidence of the effectiveness of formal and permanent \nbondholder committees like the British Corporation of Foreign Bondholders in the early \npart of the 20th century (Eichengreen and Portes, 1995; Esteves, 2005). Mauro and \nYafeh (2003, p.26) point out that, \u201c\u2026 one of the roles of the Corporation of Foreign \nBondholders (CFB) [was] to protect small bondholders from large bondholders who \nmight otherwise arrange for a separate, advantageous deal for themselves in exchange \nfor the promise to provide the country with new lending.\u201d  \n \nThis is relevant to the Argentine case where many small creditors sold out to \ninstitutional investors at prices of less than 30 cents.  Esteves (2005) suggests that \nenhanced creditor organisation will substantially increase creditor payoffs: but, because \ninstitutional investors acted to coordinate creditors and to negotiate with the debtor, the \n 18\npayoff to creditors as a whole would probably not have risen much \u2013 as the economic \nanalysis of the swap in this paper confirms.  \n \nEven without bondholder committees, there is still hope: class action suits. Buchheit \nand Gulati (2002) argue that class action suits could be used to involve courts in \nsovereign debt restructuring. According to them creditors have a basic \u201cclass\u201d interest8 \nwhich is distinguishable from the interest of an individual creditor. With CACs \nincluding SMV this class interest is better defined9. Class action procedures would \nengender the formation of ex-post, ad hoc creditor committees that would prompt the \ndebtor into making an offer. In the latest judgement in the existing (and only) certified \nclass action, Judge Griesa granted the motion of the class for summary judgement \n[H.W.URBAN GMBH, Individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated v. The \nRepublic of Argentina (9 March 2006)]. This favourable judgment increases the \neffectiveness of this option in the future. \n \nTo conclude, we see the vulture-initiated strategies for debt resolution as important \nprincipally in the period of transition to CACs. Unlike Fisch and Gentile (2004), who \nemphasise the continuing role of the vultures, we assume that SMV under CACs will \nreduce the threat of holdout litigation as we know it, but will nonetheless leave an \nimportant role for judicial intervention in debt restructuring.10   \n \nThus instead of the threat of attachment by specialist creditors, it will hopefully be the \nformation of ex ante Creditor Committees, class actions suits and the possibility of \njudge-mediated resolution of disagreements between the debtor and holdouts  that will \nprompt the debtor into making an offer to successfully restructure its debt. \n \n                                                 \n8 A class interest is one in which creditors as a class can achieve a settlement more effectively than \nindividual creditors. \n9 While Sturzenegger and Zettelmeyer (2005) may dismiss class action procedures as ineffective for \nsolving holdout problem, with CACs this is no longer an issue. \n10 The incentives for vultures to litigate will arise from issues in which they have a SMV. They will use \nthe courts to enforce hundred percent claims against the debtor. In the absence of unanimity however, \nthese claims will be isolated at the margin and will not affect the entire debt. \n \n 19\nConclusions  \n \nOur interpretation of the Argentine litigation is that Judge Griesa used creditor \nheterogeneity to promote the swap \u2013 encouraging holdouts to bring the debtor to the \nnegotiating table but restraining them when they threaten the swap itself. Following this \ninterpretation, we believe that the Judge will encourage the holdouts to threaten \nArgentina\u2019s access to primary credit markets unless and until it deals satisfactorily with \ncreditors outside the swap. The latter is made possible by his willingness to resolve \ndisagreements that may arise between the holdouts and Argentina. If this happens, \nArgentina should regain access to primary credit markets. \n \nOur conclusions differ from those of Sturzenegger and Zettelmeyer (2005) who are \ninclined to dismiss the role of holdout litigation in favour of reputational models. Our \ninterpretation can also be contrasted with the view that holdout litigation represents a \nlasting solution to sovereign debt crises, Fisch and Gentile (2004). We agree with them \nthat holdout litigation is \u2018part of the solution and not the problem\u2019 (Roubini, 2002), but \nbelieve that to be true only in the period of transition to CACs. Our description of judge-\nmediated debt restructuring emphasises the role of the common law judges in the \norderly resolution of sovereign debt crises, currently and in the future. \n \n \nReferences \n \nBarnett, Barry C., Sergio J.

In addition, the Argentine \ncase challenged the idea that the IMF must play a central role in arranging sovereign \ndebt swaps: stymied by conflict of interest and criticised by both debtor and creditors \nfor its earlier handling of Argentina\u2019s affairs, the Fund had to withdraw to the sidelines \nand let creditors and the debtor sort things out themselves.11 \n \nWith the IMF hors de combat, the New York Court had perforce to play a greater role. \nBut the court does not carry the same big stick as the Fund: its role is to promote \nnegotiations between sovereign and the creditors to achieve a fair outcome, and to \npreserve the sovereign debt market. In this spirit, Dhillon et al. 2006 apply a bargaining \napproach to explain both the final settlement and the delay in achieving it, assuming \nimplicitly that the court is holding the ring. The authors follow the approach of Merlo \nand Wilson (1998)  where the size of the pie is uncertain and \u2018efficient delay\u2019 can occur \nas creditor and debtor wait for economic recovery - fearing that early settlement will \nlock in the recession. (The Rubinstein model of alternating offers, applied to sovereign \ndebt negotiations by Bulow and Rogoff (1989), is not used because it predicts prompt \nsettlement.) \n \nBased on the creditor response to the initial Argentine offer at Dubai in 2003 Dhillon et \nal. (2006) estimate that the \u201cpie\u201d to be divided between debtor and creditors was worth \nalmost 3% of GDP. Allowing for the \u201cfirst mover\u201d advantage for the debtor as proposer, \nthe bargaining model implies that creditors receive a little under half the pie. On this \nbasis, the predicted recovery rate on debt without interest is 41 cents \u2013 a little better than \nthe final settlement (estimated to be worth about 34 cents in Table 2). \nAs for the prolonged delay, the authors note that political factors played a critical role \nuntil 2003 when President Duhalde \u2013 appointed earlier by Congress as interim office-\nholder \u2013 was replaced by President Kirchner after a general election. Because the \nexpected annual rate of economic recovery in 2003 exceeded the time rate of discount12, \nit is claimed that further postponement was economically \u2018efficient\u2019. An alternative \n                                                 \n11 \u201cArgentina has become a test case for a vastly reduced role for the IMF and the official sector more \nbroadly in the sovereign debt restructuring process\u201d, Roubini and Setser (2004a). \n12 Estimated to be 4% for both parties \n 26\naccount for delay under President Kirchner is explored by Ghosal and Miller (2006). \nThere it is noted that, if the debtor is aware of the constraints impose by sustainability \nwhile the creditor is not, the former may have an incentive to make a low offer leading \nto delay in order to act as a signal to the creditor (that sustainability is a serious cause \nfor concern). On this reasoning, the Argentine government would not have expected  \ncreditors to accept the offer made at Dubai in 2003; but the final settlement reached in \n2005 - broadly in line with Argentina\u2019s sustainability guidelines - would reflect a \nsuccessful signalling strategy by the President and his finance minister.13  \n \nThe observed delay and the write down are, it seems, broadly consistent with a \nbargaining approach. Moreover, according to Porzecanski (2005), the fall of the \ncurrency rendered the government insolvent because of the large debts contracted by \nprevious administrations. He notes in his introduction that \u201c[a] sinking currency \nrendered the government instantly insolvent; the net government debt, which at the one \npeso per dollar exchange rate was equivalent to three times tax revenues and 50% of \nGDP, virtually tripled once the currency sank to around three pesos per dollar, \nbecoming unaffordable to service\u201d: and he also observes that policy prior to 2002 \ninvolved the authorities then in power \u201cbetting the ranch\u201d by borrowing almost \nexclusively in dollars and other foreign currencies to finance a string of budgetary \ndeficits, even though their revenues were due and collected only in pesos.14 \n(Porzecanski, 2005). \n \nIf Argentina was insolvent for reasons to do with previous administrations, why should \nit be treated as a rogue debtor? In our view, it all depends on how creditors outside the \nswap are dealt with. The bargaining model assumes that all creditors get parity of \ntreatment (as they might with under CACs). So far, however, those outside the swap \nhave received nothing. How the sovereign might deal with the holdouts so as to avoid \nbeen treated as rogue debtor is discussed in section 4 of the paper. \n \n                                                 \n13 Roberto Frankel, an economist who was a close observer of the swap, reckoned that the finance \nminister deserved a bronze statue in the Plaza de Mayo for his negotiating tactics! (Liascovich, 2005, \np.257 ) \n14 For an interesting analysis of how a government which cannot pre-commit to control spending may \nexpose the country to recurrent crises, see Rochet (2005).  \n"}
