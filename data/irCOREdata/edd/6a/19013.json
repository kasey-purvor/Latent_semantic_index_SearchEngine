A process model was tested which proposed that perceptions of parental autonomy support \nand two life goals (health and image) would predict adolescents\u2019 degree of satisfaction of their \nbasic psychological needs. In turn, psychological need satisfaction was hypothesised to \nnegatively predict body image concerns (i.e., drive for thinness and body dissatisfaction) and, \nindirectly, unhealthy weight control behaviours. The predictions of the model were largely \nsupported indicating that parental autonomy support and adaptive life goals can indirectly impact \nupon the extent to which female adolescents engage in unhealthy weight control behaviours via \nfacilitating the latter\u2019s  psychological need satisfaction. \n \nKey words: Parental autonomy support, life goals, psychological need satisfaction, body image \nconcerns \n \n 3\nUnhealthy Weight Control Behaviours in Adolescent Girls: A Process Model Based on Self-\nDetermination Theory \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nThe incessant societal emphasis on appearance, image and physical attractiveness leads many \nyoung people, especially adolescent girls, to engage in unhealthy weight control behaviours \nwhich they believe will help them approximate or attain these body-related ideals (French, \nPerry, Leon, & Fulkerson, 1995). Although many adolescents consider that extreme weight \ncontrol behaviours are harmless to health (Grigg, Bowman, & Redman, 1996), compelling \nevidence suggests that engagement in such behaviours might lead to outcomes as diverse as \nnutritional inadequacy (Gibbons, Wertheim, Paxton, Petrovich, & Szmukler, 1995; Neumark-\nSztainer, Hannan, Story, & Perry, 2004), depression (Stice, Hayward, Cameron, Killen, & \nTaylor, 2000), suicide ideation and suicide attempts (Neumark-Sztainer, Story, Dixon, & \nMurray, 1998), as well as obesity (Stice, Cameron, Killen, Hayward, & Taylor, 1999). Yet, \nunhealthy weight control behaviours are relatively common among adolescents, especially \nfemales (Croll et al., 2002). For example, a large survey study showed that more than fifty \npercent of adolescent girls in the US reported the use of unhealthy weight control behaviours \n(e.g., fasting, skipping meals) during the previous year (Neumark-Sztainer, Story, Hannan, \nPerry, & Irving, 2002). While the majority of research in this area has been conducted with \nUS adolescents, evidence also suggests that disordered eating attitudes are becoming more \nevident in adolescents from Mediterranean countries. For example, 20.3 percent of Greek \nfemales and 7.3 percent of males are reported to engage in disordered eating behaviours \n(Yannakoulia et al., 2004).  \nGiven that body dissatisfaction represents a substantial risk factor of disordered eating \n(Attie & Brooks-Gunn, 1989), it is not surprising that many programmes designed to prevent \nsuch behaviours in adolescent girls have featured body dissatisfaction as a key outcome \nvariable (Neumark-Sztainer et al., 2006). Indeed, empirical research has shown that restrictive \n 4\neating patterns are predicted by body dissatisfaction and drive for thinness (which is \nindicative of an excessive concern with dieting, pursuit of thinness and weight preoccupation) \nin women and men (e.g., Keski-Rahkonen et al., 2005), as well as in adolescent girls (Keery, \nvan den Berg, & Thompsom, 2004). Although overweight and obese adolescents tend to \nengage in more unhealthy weight control behaviours than their normal weight or underweight \ncounterparts (e.g., Boutelle et al., 2002; Neumark-Sztainer et al., 1999), research by \nNeumark-Sztainer et al. (2003) showed that the relationship between Body Mass Index (BMI) \nand unhealthy weight control behaviours in adolescents was indirect via weight-related body \nconcerns (e.g., body dissatisfaction). \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \nTheory-based explanations can be particularly useful in understanding some of the \nprocesses underpinning the development of body dissatisfaction and unhealthy weight control \nbehaviours. Theoretical frameworks that have already been utilised in this research area (e.g., \nsocial comparison theory; Wood, 1989) have often focused on proximal predictors of body \nimage evaluations, such as universalistic social comparisons (e.g., When I judge how \nattractive I am, I compare myself with actors\/actresses\/singers that I see on television or in \nmovies; Morrison, Kalin, & Morrison, 2004). However, it is not clear why certain individuals \nare more likely to engage in social comparison processes or feel more concerned about their \nbody appearance than others. Thus, it is important to examine deeper psychological \nmechanisms that foster versus undermine personal growth and development and can lead to \nunhealthy weight control behaviours. To this end, the purpose of the present study is to utilise \na self-determination theory (SDT; Deci & Ryan, 2000) which can provide an account of such \ndeeper psychological mechanisms, and thus offer a complimentary angle in the examination \nof such important behaviours. Specifically, we use SDT to test a model (see Figure 1) that \nexamines whether enduring personal factors (i.e., psychological needs and life goals), as well \n 5\nas contextual influences (i.e., perceptions of parental autonomy support), are implicated in \ntheir presence of unhealthy weight control behaviours in a sample of adolescent girls. \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nSDT is a macro theory of human motivation which postulates that all individuals have \ninnate tendencies toward psychological growth and development. Such tendencies can be \nfacilitated by the social context via the satisfaction of three basic psychological needs, namely \nautonomy, competence and relatedness. Autonomy reflects a desire to engage in activities of \none\u2019s choosing and to be the origin of one\u2019s own behaviour. Competence refers to \nindividuals\u2019 need to interact effectively with their environment and to experience a sense of \neffectance in producing desired outcomes and preventing undesired events. Finally, \nrelatedness is the need to feel connected to and accepted by others in a social milieu. \nAlthough all three psychological needs are essential, the degree to which they are satisfied \nvaries from one context to another (Deci & Ryan, 2000). According to basic needs theory, a \nsub-theory within SDT, the satisfaction of the three psychological needs can lead to \npsychological health, well-being and human actualisation. However, when the social context \nundermines these three psychological needs, individuals are likely to experience ill-being and \nnon-optimal functioning. \nMore recently, SDT has been used as a theoretical framework to understand the darker \nsides of human behaviour, for example the motivation to engage in risk behaviours \n(Neighbors, Lewis, Fossos, & Grossbard, 2007; Williams et al., 2000). One such behaviour, \ndisordered eating, reflects body image concerns and the struggle for body control. According \nto SDT, this struggle results from feelings of lack of psychological need satisfaction in one\u2019s \nlife. Deci and Ryan (2000) argued that the thwarting of the three basic psychological needs \nwill lead to psychological ill-being and the development of rigid or self-defeating behaviours, \nsuch as abstaining from eating. Lack of autonomy need satisfaction reflects a generalised \nperception of lack of control over one\u2019s life. An outcome of autonomy need thwarting can be \n 6\nthe struggle to control one\u2019s appearance (manifested via unhealthy weight control behaviours \nand\/or body image concerns) in an attempt to establish control over an aspect of one\u2019s life. \nEmpirical research supports indirectly this proposition. For example, women\u2019s level of \nautonomy in their lives appears to protect against body image pressures (Pelletier & Dion, \n2007) and is negatively associated with bulimic behaviours (Pelletier, Dion, & L\u00e9vesque, \n2004). Further, in a sample of (mainly female) aerobics instructors, general autonomy need \nsatisfaction was found to negatively predict body image concerns (i.e., body dissatisfaction \nand drive for thinness; Th\u00f8gersen-Ntoumani & Ntoumanis, 2007). Although such evidence is \ncross-sectional in nature, it suggests the possibility that perceptions of control over one\u2019s life \nmay be important in protecting against the development of body image concerns.  \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nThe struggle for body control might also represent a compensatory activity that \nmanifests when individuals\u2019 needs for competence and relatedness are thwarted. Competence \nneed thwarting reflects generalised feelings of ineffectance in one\u2019s life. As Deci and Ryan \n(2000) stated, not eating (or other unhealthy behaviours) can represent one domain in which \nindividuals can have control over their own behaviours and, therefore, feel effective. Lastly, \nrelatedness need thwarting reflects lack of meaningful relationships and feelings of isolation \nin one\u2019s life. The thwarting of this psychological need can also lead to a struggle for body \ncontrol in an attempt to gain social acceptance and approval by meeting societal standards of \nideal physique standards. To our knowledge, empirical research examining the role of \npsychological need satisfaction in predicting body image concerns and unhealthy eating \nbehaviours has not been conducted with adolescent populations. This is despite evidence \nsuggesting that body image problems and associated unhealthy weight control behaviours \noften manifest themselves during adolescence (Levine & Smolak, 2002; Richards, Boxer, \nPetersen, & Albrecht, 1990). Based on theoretical propositions and previous research, we \nexpected that psychological need satisfaction (a composite measure of the three needs; for a \n 7\nsimilar approach see also Deci, Ryan, Gagn\u00e9, Leon, Usunov, & Kornazheva, 2001) would be \ndirectly and negatively linked to body image concerns (see Fig. 1; Hypothesis 1). Further, \ngiven the aforementioned evidence (e.g., Keery et al., 2004) linking body image concerns and \nunhealthy weight control behaviours, we expected a similar relationship between these \nvariables in our model (Hypothesis 2). In addition, we hypothesised that psychological need \nsatisfaction would have a negative indirect effect on unhealthy weight control behaviours \n(Hypothesis 3). \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nAccording to SDT, the degree to which individuals\u2019 basic psychological needs are \nsatisfied can be partly explained by the different life goals (also referred to as life aspirations) \nthat they hold. The theory posits that life goals can be broadly categorised as intrinsic (e.g., \ncommunity contribution, health, personal growth and affiliation) and extrinsic (e.g., fame, \nimage, and financial success) in nature. According to Kasser and Ryan (1996), the pursuit and \nattainment of intrinsic life goals provides greater satisfaction of the three psychological needs \nand is more strongly associated with psychological functioning and well-being, than the \npursuit and attainment of extrinsic goals. Intrinsic goals motivate individuals to act in \naccordance with their inner values and beliefs, thus facilitating the experience of autonomy. In \ncontrast, extrinsic goals control individuals\u2019 behaviours because they are focused on obtaining \nextrinsic rewards and social approval (Kasser, Ryan, Zax, & Sameroff, 1995). Further, \nwhereas intrinsic goals offer opportunities for meaningful interactions with others and \ncontributions to the common good, extrinsic goals often alienate individuals in their pursuit of \nmaterialistic objectives. Lastly, the attainment of intrinsic goals is more likely to result in \ndeeper and more secure feelings of competence, whereas feelings of competence resulting \nfrom the attainment of extrinsic goals are likely to be short-lived because individuals will \noften set new, more difficult, goals. According to Kasser and Ryan (1996), extrinsic goals \nreflect a sense of insecurity about oneself and lead one to engage in more stressful activities \n 8\nwith detrimental effects for their health and well-being. In support of these arguments, recent \nempirical research within an organisational setting (Vansteenkiste, Neyrinck, Niemiec, \nSoenens, De Witte, & Van den Broeck, 2007), has shown that the positive relationship \nbetween extrinsic work value orientations (e.g., aspiring towards financial success and \nexerting control and power over others) and negative job outcomes (e.g., emotional \nexhaustion and turn-over intention) was largely explained by the thwarting of the needs for \nautonomy, competence and relatedness at work. However, as yet, there is a lack of empirical \nresearch examining the interrelationships between life goals, psychological need satisfaction \nand body image concerns.  \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \nIn the present study, based on SDT propositions and the work of Vansteenkiste et al. \n(2007), we examined whether intrinsic and extrinsic goals could predict psychological need \nsatisfaction, and indirectly body image concerns. With regard to intrinsic life goals (i.e., self-\nacceptance, affiliation, community contribution, and health) measured in the SDT literature \nwe focused on health as a predictor of body image concerns, because it is a life goal which is \nvery relevant to the physical domain. For the same reason, the extrinsic goal of image (as \nopposed to other extrinsic goals such as financial success or fame) was expected to also be \nmore implicated in the development of body image concerns. Thus, and in an effort to present \na parsimonious model, we included only these two life goals in our model. We expected that \nhealth goals would be positively related to psychological need satisfaction (Hypothesis 4), \nwhile a negative or non-significant link was expected between image goals and need \nsatisfaction (Hypothesis 5). We also predicted, however, a direct positive relationship \nbetween image goals and body image concerns (Hypothesis 6). While such a hypothesised \nlink is not derived from SDT, it seems reasonable to suggest given that appearance ideals for \nadolescent girls are notoriously difficult to achieve (Levine & Smolak, 2002), and girls to \n 9\nwhom such ideals are important, are more likely to feel insecure and stressed about their \nappearance. \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \nAs previously alluded to, according to SDT, the social environment can play an \nimportant role in facilitating psychological need satisfaction (Deci & Ryan, 2000). One \ncontextual factor that has received a lot of empirical attention in the SDT literature is the \nprovision of autonomy support by significant others (e.g., parents). Parents are particularly \npertinent social agents in the lives of adolescents. According to SDT, parents can be \nautonomy supportive towards their children by taking their children\u2019s perspectives into \naccount, by allowing them to solve problems on their own, by encouraging initiation, \nminimising pressure, and offering choice and meaningful rationales for task engagement \n(Grolnick, Price, Beiswenger, & Sauck, 2007). Parental autonomy support can also influence \nthe life goals that young people adopt. For example, previous research has shown that less \nautonomy supportive mothers tend to have teenage children who value extrinsic goals (i.e., \nfinancial success) relatively highly (Kasser et al., 1995). Thus, when mothers are \nunsupportive and distant with their children the latter are likely to adopt extrinsic goals that \nserve to \u201cprove worth\u201d. One limitation of this study was that the researchers did not examine \nthe role of fathers. Similarly, in a study with high school students, Williams, Cox, Hedberg, \nand Deci (2000) showed that participants who perceived their parents to be autonomy \nsupportive valued intrinsic goals (i.e., self-acceptance, affiliation and community goals) more \nhighly and were less likely to rate as important extrinsic goals such as financial success and \nimage. Finally, a prospective study spanning twenty six years demonstrated that young adults \nwith extrinsic values had parents who were more controlling when they were children \n(Kasser, Koestner, & Lekes, 2002). In view of this evidence, in the context of our \ntheoretically derived model we expected parental autonomy support (from both mothers and \n 10\nfathers) to be positively related to psychological need satisfaction and the intrinsic goal of \nhealth (hypothesis 7), and negatively related to image goals (hypothesis 8). \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to empirically test an SDT-derived \nmodel incorporating parental autonomy support and life goals as predictors of the processes \nunderlying the development of unhealthy weight control behaviours in adolescent girls. As \nsuch, the model has the potential to contribute to and expand previous literature in this area. \nThe model might also serve as an important framework for designing effective interventions \nto reduce unhealthy weight control behaviours in this population. \n \nMethod \nParticipants \nParticipants were 350 adolescent girls aged 12-16 years (M age = 13.58; SD = 1.20) attending \nrecreational summer camps in and around Athens, Greece. All participants were secondary \nschool students from a low to middle class socioeconomic background. Based on Cole et al.\u2019s \n(2000) international cut-off criteria for body mass index for overweight and obesity in \nchildren and adolescents aged 2-18, 85.70% were classified as either underweight or normal \nweight and 14.30% as overweight or obese. \nMeasures \nBody Mass Index (BMI). Based on self-reported height and weight, BMI was calculated \nusing the formula kg\/m2. \nUnhealthy weight control behaviours. Adapted from similar scales previously used by \nNeumark-Sztainer et al. (2002, 2006), participants were asked whether they had engaged in \nany of the following behaviours in order to lose weight in the last year: \u201ctaken laxatives or \nwater pills\u201d, \u201ctaken diet pills\u201d, \u201cskipped meals\u201d, \u201cfasted (not eaten) for a day or more\u201d, and \n\u201cmade yourself throw up\u201d. The participants were asked to rate the extent to which they had \nengaged in each behaviour using a scale ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (always). For descriptive \n 11\npurposes, the participants engaging in one or more of each behaviour \u201ca little\u201d (2), \n\u201csometimes\u201d (3), \u201ca lot\u201d (4), or \u201calways\u201d (5) were classified as using unhealthy weight control \nbehaviours (see Table 2). Internal reliability coefficients from past research are not available, \nas weight control behaviours have traditionally been measured in a dichotomous fashion (e.g., \nNeumark-Sztainer et al., 2002, 2006). \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nBody Image Concerns. The Drive for Thinness (7 items) and Body Dissatisfaction (9 \nitems) subscales from the Eating Disorder Inventory-2 (EDI-2; Garner, 1991) were used to \nmeasure body image concerns. The drive for thinness subscale measures excessive concerns \nwith dieting, pursuit of thinness and weight preoccupation. The body dissatisfaction subscale \nassesses dissatisfaction with a range of body parts (e.g., buttocks and hips), as well as the \ndegree to which these body parts are perceived to be too large\/fat. Each item is measured on a \n6-point scale ranging from 1 (never) to 6 (always). Garner provided evidence for the validity \nand reliability of the EDI-2, and reported internal consistency coefficients ranging between \u03b1 \n= .80 and \u03b1 = .92. \nNeed Satisfaction. The Basic Need Satisfaction in Life scale (Gagn\u00e9, 2003) was used to \nmeasure satisfaction of the needs for autonomy (7 items), competence (8 items) and \nrelatedness (6 items). The scale comprises 21 items measured on a scale from 1 (not true at \nall) to 7 (definitely true). Example items are: \u201cI feel like I am free to decide how to live my \nlife\u201d (autonomy), \u201cMost days I feel a sense of accomplishment from what I do\u201d (competence), \nand \u201cI really like the people I interact with\u201d (relatedness). Gagn\u00e9 reported alphas of .69, .86 \nand .71 for autonomy, relatedness and competence, respectively. \nLife goals. The Aspirations Index (Kasser & Ryan, 1996) was adopted to measure the \nimportance of health and image goals (5 items for each goal). The participants were asked to \nrate how important each of the life goals were to them on a scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to \n7 (very). Example items included \u201cto be physically healthy\u201d (health) and \u201cto have people \n 12\ncomment often about how attractive I look\u201d (image). Piko and Keresztes (2006) have reported \nhigh alpha reliability coefficients for the health (\u03b1 = .84) and image factors (\u03b1 = .92) in young \npeople ranging in age from 14 to 21 years. \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n Parental autonomy support. The Perception of Parents Scale (Grolnick, Ryan, & Deci, \n1991) was used to measure perceptions of autonomy support provided by both parents. The \nautonomy support scale consists of six items for each parent. The participants were asked to \ncircle the letter of one of four descriptions of a parent (mother and father, or where applicable \nrespective non-biological parents) that is most like her own. An example item is: \"Some \nmothers are always telling their children what to do but other mothers like their children to \ndecide for themselves what to do\u201d. Grolnick et al. presented internal reliability coefficients \nfrom various samples ranging from \u03b1 = .53 to \u03b1= .70. \nProcedures \nThe study received approval from the ethics committee of a Greek University. All scales were \ntranslated from English to Greek and backwards by a team of three bilingual university \nprofessors. When consensus on the item content was achieved, the questionnaires were \ndistributed by trained research assistants to female participants in a recreational summer \ncamp. The participants and their parents signed informed consent forms and were reassured \nthat the responses to the questionnaires would be anonymous and confidential. \nData analysis \nWe first calculated Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficients and descriptive statistics for all variables. \nWe also calculated frequency counts of engagement in each of the unhealthy weight control \nbehaviours. We then used structural equation modelling analysis (SEM) to test the \nhypothesised process model. Given that we measured a variety of distinct behaviours, for \nparsimony reasons we decided to include in the model one outcome dichotomous variable that \nindicated whether the participants had engaged (i.e., had a frequency score of 2 or above; n \n 13\n=128) or not (i.e., had a frequency score of 1; n = 222) in any of the five behaviours (for a \nsimilar approach, see Neumark-Sztainer et al., 2002, 2006). We used the EQS software \n(version 6. 1; Bentler, 2003) to perform the analysis. We employed the robust maximum \nlikelihood estimation method because the normalised estimate of Mardia\u2019s coefficient was \n14.25, indicating departure from multivariate normality. For models containing categorical \nvariables (such as the dichotomous variable in our study), EQS uses the analytical approach \ndeveloped by Lee, Poon, and Bentler (1995). \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nResults \nPreliminary analyses \nTable 1 illustrates internal reliability coefficients and descriptive statistics for all variables. \nAll internal reliability coefficients were \u03b1 > .70, except the one for parental autonomy support \nwhich displayed a marginal value (\u03b1 = .67). However, because of the centrality of this \nconstruct within the model and self-determination theory, we retained the parental support \nscale. The mean scores for most variables were generally in the moderate range, with the \nexception of health goals, autonomy and relatedness need satisfaction, which were rated \nrelatively high. In contrast, the mean value for unhealthy weight control behaviour was quite \nlow. Table 2 displays frequency counts of engagement in each of the unhealthy weight control \nbehaviours. Skipping meals was a commonly adopted strategy, while fasting was adopted, at \nleast occasionally, by nearly one third of the participants. Vomiting to lose weight was a more \ncommonly adopted behaviour compared to using laxatives, water pills and diet pills. \n \nTesting the Hypothesised Model \nSEM was used to model the process by which parental autonomy support and life goals \npredict unhealthy weight control behaviours. Body mass index and unhealthy weight control \nwere observed variables in the model. The psychological constructs in the model were tested \n 14\nas latent factors. Body image concerns were modelled as a latent factor indexed by the \ncomposite scores for drive for thinness and body dissatisfaction. Psychological need \nsatisfaction was indexed by three indicators representing the composite scores for autonomy, \ncompetence and relatedness. Family autonomy support, health goals and image goals were \nindexed by three indicators each. These indicators (also called \u201cparcels\u201d) represented \nunweighted average scores created by pairing up items with the strongest loadings with items \nwith weaker loadings from the same scale (Little, Cunningham, Shahar, & Widaman, 2002). \nParcelling is used with unidimensional scales as a means of increasing the stability of \nparameter estimates and keeping an acceptable ratio of sample size to estimated parameters in \nstudies involving relatively low sample sizes (Bandalos & Finney, 2001). \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n We first tested the model shown in Figure 1 having independent (but correlated) \nmother and father autonomy support factors. However, this model did not converge and \nproduced an improper solution with many standardised parameter coefficients being greater \nthan 1 (including the correlation between the two autonomy support factors). An inspection of \nthe modification indices suggested that the residuals of their respective indicators should be \nalso correlated. Based on this finding, we collapsed the two factors into a Parental Autonomy \nSupport factor and re-tested the model. The solution converged, producing good fit indices: \nRobust \u03c72 (97) = 176.10, p< .01; robust NNFI = .94, robust CFI = .96, robust RMSEA = .05, \nSRMR = .06. As shown in Figure 1, parental autonomy support negatively predicted image \ngoals and positively predicted health goals. However, the latter path was not statistically \nsignificant, contrary to our expectations. Psychological need satisfaction was positively \npredicted by parental autonomy support and health goals and negatively predicted by image \ngoals. However, contrary to our hypothesis, the prediction made by image goals was not \nstatistically significant. After controlling for body mass index, body image concerns were \nnegatively predicted by psychological need satisfaction and positively by image goals. Lastly, \n 15\nunhealthy weight behaviours were positively predicted by body image concerns. We removed \nthe two non-significant paths and re-estimated the model, however, the fit indices and \nparameter estimates remained essentially unchanged. The average corrected R squared \ncoefficient for these regression paths was 30%. The average item-factor loading in the model \nwas .71. Significant indirect effects (p < .05) on unhealthy weight behaviours were found \nfrom body mass index (\u03b2 = .41), psychological need satisfaction (\u03b2 = -.19), parental autonomy \nsupport (\u03b2 = -.10), health (\u03b2 = -.05) and image (\u03b2 = .14) goals. The other significant indirect \neffect in the model was from health goals to body image concerns (\u03b2 = -.11)1. We did not \nconduct tests for mediation because there is no conceptual evidence to suggest that the \nintervening variables are mediators (for a discussion between mediated and indirect effects, \nsee Preacher & Hayes, 2004). \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n \nDiscussion \nDrawing from Deci and Ryan\u2019s (2000) self-determination theory, the present study aimed to \ntest a model presenting socio-contextual and personal predictors of body image concerns and \nunhealthy weight control behaviours in a sample of female adolescents. The results were \nlargely supportive of the model and our hypotheses and were aligned with previous related \nwork (e.g., Pelletier & Dion, 2007; Th\u00f8gersen-Ntoumani & Ntoumanis, 2007). Specifically, \nwe found basic need psychological satisfaction to be a direct negative predictor of body image \nconcerns (as indicated by drive for thinness and body dissatisfaction), and an indirect negative \npredictor of unhealthy weight control behaviours (e.g., skipping meals, fasting). Further, body \nimage concerns had an independent effect on unhealthy weight control behaviours. Taken \ntogether, these findings fully support our first three hypotheses. As advocated by Deci and \nRyan, the struggle to control one\u2019s body appearance as well as the engagement in behaviours \nthat compromise one\u2019s health and well-being are often reflective of compensatory processes \nthat are trigged by one\u2019s frustration of basic psychological need satisfaction. In contrast, when \n 16\nthe three basic psychological needs are satisfied, individuals tend to act in accordance with \ninner resources to pursue personally meaningful activities that enhance, as opposed to \nundermine, their psychological and physical well-being (Deci et al., 2001). \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n Given that body image pressures and associated unhealthy weight control behaviours \nare frequently manifested during adolescence (e.g., Levine & Smolak, 2002; Richards, et al., \n1990), in particular in females, it is important to understand which factors predict \npsychological need satisfaction in this population, and indirectly unhealthy weight control \nbehaviours. Again drawing from SDT, we examined two such factors in our model. These \nwere the life goals that the adolescents held and the degree to which their parents were \nautonomy supportive. According to Kasser and Ryan (1996), the life goals or aspirations that \nindividuals hold can be broadly categorised as being intrinsic or extrinsic in nature. In this \nstudy we examined two life goals that are relevant to the physical domain. The first was the \nintrinsic goal of being physically healthy and the second goal was the extrinsic goal of an \nattractive image. Based on Kasser and Ryan and Vansteenkiste et al.\u2019s (2007) work, we \nexpected (hypotheses 4 and 5) that health goals would positively predict psychological need \nsatisfaction, whereas image goals would be either negatively related or unrelated to need \nsatisfaction. Both hypotheses were supported in our model. Having the goal of leading a \nhealthy lifestyle leads individuals to choices that support self-actualisation and personal \ngrowth and minimise risk to physical and psychological health. Such lifestyle choices and \nactions do not impair one\u2019s social interactions and, because they are self-concordant, they \nattract high levels of effortful investment often resulting in goal attainment (Sheldon & Elliot, \n1998). In contrast, extrinsic goals are not conducive to the satisfaction of the three \npsychological needs. The goal of an attractive image usually results in the pursuit of \nexternally-defined standards of attractiveness and beauty that control one\u2019s behaviours and \nchoices, does not promote or encourage meaningful interactions with others and offers, at \n 17\nbest, short-lived feelings of personal effectance. In our study image goals were unrelated to \npsychological need satisfaction and, as expected (hypothesis 6), were positively related to \nbody image concerns. The latter finding suggests that current stringent (and for many young \nfemales unattainable; Levine & Smolak, 2002) standards of appearance ideals can result in \nfeelings of insecurity and dissatisfaction with body appearance. It is also worth noting that \nhealth and image goals had significant indirect effects on unhealthy weight control behaviours \nvia body image concerns and (for health goals only) psychological need satisfaction. \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n The second factor we studied as a predictor of psychological need satisfaction, and \nindirectly unhealthy weight control behaviours, in female adolescents was parental autonomy \nsupport. Based on Deci and Ryan\u2019s (2000) theorising and previous empirical work (e.g., \nWilliams et al., 2000), we expected that parents who support their children\u2019s initiatives, offer \nchoices, minimise pressure and do not impose their own beliefs and standards, are more likely \nto facilitate psychological need satisfaction in their offspring and the adoption of intrinsic \ngoals (hypothesis 7), as opposed to extrinsic goals (hypothesis 8). Whereas hypothesis 8 was \nsupported, hypothesis 7 was only partly supported. Specifically, parental autonomy support \nwas a positive predictor of adolescent\u2019s need satisfaction, but was unrelated to the pursuit of \nhealth goals. Whilst the link between autonomy support and psychological need satisfaction is \nin accordance with a large body of literature (e.g., see Gronlick et al., 1991), the latter finding \nwas unexpected. It is possible that health goals, as opposed to other intrinsic goals such as \ncommunity contribution, are less influenced by external influences and more likely to develop \nfrom personal beliefs and values. An alternative explanation is that health goals, as other life \ngoals in adolescence, are probably affected not only by parents but also by other social agents, \nin particular peers. This might explain why the paths from parental autonomy support to both \nlife goals assessed in our study were smaller than the other paths in the model. Lastly, it is \ninteresting to note that parental autonomy support had a significant indirect effect on \n 18\nunhealthy weight control behaviours via psychological need satisfaction and body image \nconcerns. \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nConclusions, Implications, Limitations and Future Research Directions \nOur findings indicate that many Greek adolescent females engage in unhealthy weight control \nbehaviours (primarily skipping meals and fasting for a day or more). Such behaviours reflect \nconcerns and feelings of dissatisfaction with their body image. Our results also indicate that \nwhen adolescents\u2019 basic psychological needs are satisfied, they are less likely to worry about \nthe adequacy of their body appearance and engage in unhealthy weight control behaviours. \nAll three psychological needs played an important role in this study. This can be inferred by \nthe relatively similar loadings of the three psychological needs on the psychological need \nsatisfaction latent variable. Further, correlation analysis (not reported here, but available upon \nrequest), showed that the correlations of each psychological need with autonomy support, the \ntwo life goals, body dissatisfaction and drive for thinness were very similar. Psychological \nneed satisfaction is facilitated when adolescents pursue life goals that aim to sustain a healthy \nlifestyle and when their parents are supportive and empowering. In contrast, pursuing life \ngoals that aim to attain societal standards of ideal physique is not conducive to psychological \nneed satisfaction and may result in worries and feelings of inadequacy about one\u2019s body \nimage. \n Our findings have implications for parenting practices and for the promotion of life \ngoals in young people. In terms of parenting practices, the benefits of parental autonomy \nsupport found in this study are aligned with a large volume of SDT literature. It should be \nstated here that Gronlick, Deci and Ryan (1997) have made an important distinction between \nautonomy and independence. Promoting adolescents\u2019 autonomy does not mean that parents \nshould become distant or encourage their offspring to break ties with them. Rather, autonomy \nsupport implies that parents should offer emotional support, advice and guidance when \n 19\nneeded without demanding conformity; their overarching aim should be to help their children \ntake responsibility for their actions and their consequences. In contrast, it is cold, distant or \nunreliable parenting that promotes children\u2019s independence because the latter have to learn to \nact on their own without parental advice or guidance.  According to Gronlick et al., children \nwith emotionally supportive parents display better mental health than those with detached \nparents. In addition of being autonomy supportive or distant, parents can also be controlling in \ntheir interactions by exerting pressure, demanding conformity, minimising choice and \napplying excessive monitoring. Such controlling behaviours undermine psychological need \nsatisfaction (Deci & Ryan, 2000). It would be interesting if future research examining the role \nof parental influence on young people\u2019s body image concerns and dysfunctional weight \ncontrol behaviours considered, besides autonomy support, controlling and detached parental \ninterpersonal styles. \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n The second implication of our findings concerns the life goals female adolescents \nadopt. Our findings offer support to previous SDT-based work (e.g., Kasser et al., 1996; \nVansteenkiste et al., 2007) demonstrating the adaptive role of intrinsic goals, as opposed to \nextrinsic goals, for psychological need satisfaction and optimal functioning. Whilst the extent \nto which different goals are adopted might be to some extent dependent upon intra-psychic \nprocesses and personal traits (Spence, Oades, & Caputi, 2004), SDT-based research has \nconsistently shown the influential role of the social context (Kasser et al., 1995). As alluded to \nearlier in this discussion, parents might not be the only significant others that influence \nadolescents\u2019 life aspirations. Thus, future research might want to examine the role of peers, \nromantic partners, teachers and the media in shaping young people\u2019s intrinsic and extrinsic \naspirations and, indirectly, impacting upon their body image perceptions and weight control \nbehaviours. \n 20\n A limitation of this study is that its design does not allow the examination of \nreciprocal effects over time. For example, the degree of psychological need satisfaction can \nalso predict future life goals or aspirations of individuals; when psychological needs are not \nfulfilled individuals are more likely to compensate by striving towards extrinsic goals (Deci & \nRyan, 2000). Also, it is possible that body image concerns can contribute to future \nperceptions of lack of need satisfaction. These reciprocal mechanisms should be investigated \nin the future with longitudinal designs. Our study relied on self-reports. Whereas one could \nargue for the inclusion of independent measures of autonomy support, such measures are not \nfree from personal biases. Further, according to Deci and Ryan (1987), it is the subjective \nperception and interpretation of the contextual influences that has a greater influence on \nindividuals\u2019 behaviour as opposed to other-source ratings of such influences. In terms of \nunhealthy weight control behaviours, the use of non-self reports is bound to be, at best, \nincomplete. Further, our findings indicate that a large percentage of the participants reported \nengaging in one or more unhealthy behaviours, despite the obvious scope for social \ndesirability bias. Another limitation of this study is that it was not possible to examine the \nindependent effects of maternal and paternal autonomy support due to the high correlation \nbetween these two variables. This is not uncommon in the SDT literature which has often \ncollapsed ratings of autonomy support for each parent (e.g., Soenens & Vansteenkiste, 2005; \nSoenens et al., 2007). This is probably because the parenting style within a family tends to be \nsomewhat similar or at least perceived as such by adolescents. Further, from a theoretical \nperspective it is not expected that parents\u2019 gender would moderate the degree to which \nperceptions of autonomy support impact on psychological need satisfaction, weight control \nconcerns and associated behaviours. Lastly, our study is limited in that no exact response rates \nwere recorded and no information was gathered to examine the representativeness of the \nsample. Nevertheless, it should be stated that the data collection was facilitated by the camp \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n 21\norganisers who advertised the study and actively encouraged parents and children to \nparticipate. Thus, the vast majority of those approached agreed to participate in the study. \nFurther, to the best of our knowledge, our sample is representative of Greek female \nadolescents. The participants came from a predominantly lower and middle class background \nand were from the metropolitan region of Athens (within which about 40% of the Greek \npopulation resides). \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n Our findings were obtained from a sample of female adolescents. We chose to study \nthis sample because in Western societies there is a high prevalence of unhealthy weight \ncontrol behaviours and disordered eating attitudes among young females (e.g., Croll et al., \n2002; Neumark-Sztainer et al., 2002; Yannakoulia et al., 2004). However, there is evidence to \nsuggest that young males also engage in disordered eating behaviours (e.g., Haines, Neumark-\nSztainer, Eisenberg, & Hannan, 2006). Thus, future research should examine whether SDT-\nbased predictors, such as those utilised in this study, could also be applied to study body \nimage concerns and unhealthy weight control behaviours in adolescent males. Further, future \nwork should attempt to integrate SDT and other theoretical frameworks in this research area \n(e.g., social comparison theory; Wood, 1996) to test a comprehensive model outlining a \nsequence of distal and more proximal predictors of body dissatisfaction and unhealthy weight \ncontrol behaviours. Lastly, future research could extend our model by investigating whether \nunhealthy weight control behaviours impact on outcomes such as school performance and \nlikelihood of illegal substance use. \n 22\nReferences 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \nAttie, I., & Brooks-Gunn, J.

An anonymous reviewer requested that we removed the overweight and obese participants \nfrom the data set and repeat the SEM analysis to ensure that our results are not attributable to \nthis group. We did so and the fit indices of the new model were very similar to the fit indices \nof the original model: Robust \u03c72 (97) = 147.62, p< .01; robust NNFI = .96, robust CFI = .97, \nrobust RMSEA = .04, SRMR = .06. Further, most path coefficients were very similar in size \nand direction with the exception, as one might expect, of the path coefficients from BMI to \nbody image concerns (\u03b2= .69; \u03b2 =. 84 in the original model), and from body image concerns \nto unhealthy weight control behaviours (\u03b2 = .31; \u03b2 =. 48 in the original model). We prefer not \nto exclude overweight and obese adolescents from our study and, therefore, we decided to \npresent the original model in Figure 1. \n 29\nTable 1 \nCronbach\u2019s Alpha Reliability Coefficients and Descriptive Statistics for all Variables \nVariables (range of scale) \u03b1 M SD \nParental autonomy support (1-4) .67 2.69 .42 \nImage goals (1-7) .86 4.47 1.51 \nHealth goals (1-7) .77 6.23 .92 \nAutonomy need satisfaction (1-7) .73 5.04 .97 \nCompetence need satisfaction (1-7) .75 4.95 .98 \nRelatedness need satisfaction (1-7) .79 5.44 .89 \nDrive for thinness (1-6) .82 3.28 1.27 \nBody dissatisfaction (1-6) .85 3.04 1.20 \nUnhealthy weight control behaviours (1-5) .75 1.25 .47 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 30\nTable 2 \nFrequency Counts of Engagement in Each Unhealthy Weight Control Behaviour During the \nPast Year  \n n % \nLaxatives and\/or water pills 12 3.40 \nDiet pills 11 3.10 \nSkipping meals 236 67.40 \nFasting (for a day or more) 109 31.10 \nVomiting 36 10.30 \n \nNote: Total N= 350 \n \n \n 31\nFigure Caption \nFigure 1.
