Introduction\nIn this paper we explore the nonlinear evolution of a two\u2013dimensional, coherent ax-\nisymmetric vortex within a steadily rotating, external strain field. Vortices commonly\noccur in atmospheric flows and idealised models such as two\u2013dimensional turbulence,\nand are subject to external forcing.\nThere have been many previous studies examining the behaviour of a two\u2013dimensional,\nforced vortex, for example in geophysical fluid dynamics where there is driving from the\nwind (Polvani and Plumb, 1992; Koh and Plumb, 2000; Thuburn and Lagneau, 1999) or\nin turbulent flows where the forcing is an irrotational flow arising from the interaction\nwith other vortices in the flow (Moffatt et al., 1994; Jime\u00b4nez et al., 1996; Bassom and\nGilbert, 1998). Understanding how such vortical structures behave and respond to ex-\nternally imposed strain fields in two\u2013dimensional turbulence is important because they\naccount for a large portion of the viscous dissipation of turbulent energy within the flow,\nwhile only occupying a tiny volume of the space (Hosokawa and Yamamoto, 1989). In at-\nmospheric flows vortices are important for the transportation of fluid particles, chemicals\nand other pollutants (Provenzale, 1999). The southern polar vortex over Antarctica is\ncontinuously forced by wind currents flowing around the southern ocean, and this vortex\n2 M. R. Turner and Andrew D. Gilbert\ntransports chemicals which break down the ozone layer, with environmental implications.\nThis vortex also shows interesting features such as a \u2018surf zone\u2019, which is a region of well\nmixed fluid encircling a vortex core. Vortices exhibiting surf zones also arise in other\natmospheric studies such as Thuburn and Lagneau (1999). These surf zones tend to form\naround a coherent core but sometimes the core undergoes a process of core splitting\nwhich has also been observed for the southern polar vortex (Charlton et al., 2004).\nMotivated by the presence of fine\u2013scale vortices in three\u2013dimensional turbulence, the\nstudy Moffatt et al. (1994) considers a three\u2013dimensional vortex tube aligned along a pos-\nitive strain axis of a steady strain field. Using the transformation of Lundgren (1982) this\nproblem is converted into a two\u2013dimensional one and an asymptotic theory is developed\nfor large Reynolds numbers. The study finds that stretched vortex tubes can survive for\nlong times even if one of the other strain axes is positive, provided the Reynolds number\nis large enough. A similar asymptotic method was later applied to a two\u2013dimensional\nvortex in a weak steady strain field by Jime\u00b4nez et al. (1996). Here the stream function\npossesses two hyperbolic points joined by dividing streamlines or separatrices: these sep-\narate an inner region of recirculating flow from the externally imposed strain field, which\ncontinues to infinity. Beyond these dividing streamlines, the asymptotic theory breaks\ndown because vorticity is stripped at the hyperbolic points from the vortex to infinity.\nThe effect of vortex stripping has been widely studied in relation to these strained vortex\nproblems and is particularly important in turbulent flows (Dritschel and Waugh (1992);\nDritschel (1995); Mariotti et al. (1994)). The results of Jime\u00b4nez et al. (1996) agree well\nwith simulations of two\u2013dimensional turbulence.\nWhile studies of steady external strain fields have been useful in understanding the\nbasic structure of vortices in turbulence and geophysical flows, vortices are generally\nexposed to time\u2013dependent strain fields. Our aim in this paper is to extend these studies\nto include the simplest form of time dependence in two dimensions, the case of a steadily\nrotating strain field, rotating with angular velocity \u03b1ext. Having such a time\u2013dependent\nstrain adds two major features to the problem that are not in the steady strain problem.\nFirst, in a frame rotating with the external strain field, the corresponding steady stream\nfunction may now show a cat\u2019s eyes topology of the flow field, at a radius where fluid\nparticles co\u2013rotate with the strain (see figure 1). If the external strain field rotates with a\nfixed angular velocity \u03b1ext then cat\u2019s eyes form at the critical radius r = rext(t) (assuming\nin our discussion here that such a radius exists) where \u03b1(rext, t) = \u03b1ext, writing \u03b1(r, t) as\nthe angular velocity of the evolving vortex. (In fact as the external angular velocity tends\nto zero these cat\u2019s eyes open out to infinity, to leave the open topology in the study of\nJime\u00b4nez et al. (1996) described above. Or, to put it another way, any vorticity stripping\nfor non\u2013zero \u03b1ext does not go to infinity, but simply recirculates in the cat\u2019s eyes.)\nAt the radius rext(t), where the fluid particles co\u2013rotate with the strain field and cat\u2019s\neyes form, the azimuthal averaged profile is flattened (Turner and Gilbert, 2007), leading\nto enhanced mixing and an increased spreading of the vortex. This is largely a kinematic\neffect: cat\u2019s eyes are present when a circulating flow field and a rotating strain field are\nsimply superposed. The second feature is more interesting, being dynamical: there now\nexists the possibility of resonance. A spreading vortex profile, such as a Gaussian case,\nhas a particular radius rcat(t) at which inviscid cat\u2019s eyes of infinitesimal width can exist\n(Le Dize`s, 2000). This radius is found by solving the inviscid linearized vorticity equation\nwith a jump condition at the radius r. The value rcat(t) corresponds to the particular\nradius r where the resulting cat\u2019s eyes are quasi\u2013steady. When the radius rcat(t) comes\nclose to the externally forced radius rext(t) there is a rapid feedback in the vorticity\nfield generating high magnitude, non\u2013axisymmetric components. This is expected to be\nparticularly important when the strain field amplitude or Reynolds number is large.\nTwo\u2013dimensional axisymmetric vortices exposed to a rotating strain field 3\nx\ny\nFigure 1. Schematic plot of the co\u2013rotating stream function (3.2) for the vorticity profile\n\u03c9 = 1\/(4pi)e\u2212r\n2\/4 superposing a rotating strain field with \u03b1ext = 0.0089 which generates cat\u2019s\neyes at rext = 4.22.\nTo understand some of the aspects of vortices spreading in a time\u2013dependent back-\nground field, this paper considers the fundamental problem of a viscously spreading\ntwo\u2013dimensional vortex in a steadily rotating strain field. Initially we take a point vor-\ntex at the origin, and after non\u2013dimensionalisation based on the vortex circulation and\nthe angular velocity of the strain field, we are left with a problem containing just two\nparameters: the Reynolds number R and the strength of the strain field A. In terms of\ndimensional parameters, A corresponds to the ratio of the strain amplitude to its angular\nvelocity \u03b1ext. For the initial point vortex, the forcing gives a critical radius rext(0) outside\nthe vortex, and a value of rcat(0) = 0. As the vortex spreads due to viscosity the vortex\ngoes though a sequence of states where these radii move towards one another, rcat(t)\nincreasing and rext(t) decreasing, until the time when rext ' rcat, where we will find a\nlarge resonant response of the vortex to the external strain.\nThis large external response also occurs in a linear framework: Lingevitch and Bernoff\n(1995) study the linear response of a fixed Gaussian vortex to an external strain, and vary\nthe angular velocity \u03b1ext. They observe a resonant response for which the linear non\u2013\naxisymmetric perturbation amplitude peaks at one particular angular frequency, i.e. at\none particular rext and corresponding \u03b1ext. We will find results that agree with this study\nin cases of weak external strain amplitude. At higher amplitudes we are unable to fix our\nvortex profile as a Gaussian because the nonlinear interactions feed back to change our\nbasic profile. However as our vortex spreads it explores the parameter space of external\nangular velocity versus vortex turnover time as is done in Lingevitch and Bernoff (1995),\nand models based on the Gaussian profile remain useful in interpreting our results.\nThe paper is laid out as follows. In \u00a72 we give the governing equations, discuss the\ndiagnostics used for monitoring the vortex evolution and the numerical scheme used in\nthe simulations. In \u00a73 we discuss the external strain field in more detail and in particular\nwhen we expect to see resonance in the vortex. In \u00a74 and \u00a75 we present the results of\nthe nonlinear simulations. Section 4 examines the evolution for varying strain amplitude\nA in the cases R = 103, for which the vortex is relatively viscous, and R = 104. Section\n5 considers R = 105 where the results become more inviscid: we see good agreement\n4 M. R. Turner and Andrew D. Gilbert\nbetween the resonance peak and the criterion rext(t) = rcat(t). Some concluding remarks\nand discussion are found in \u00a76.\n2. Formulation\nWe consider the vorticity equation in two\u2013dimensional polar coordinates (r\u2217, \u03b8),\n\u2202t\u2217\u03c9\n\u2217 + J(\u03c9\u2217, \u03c8\u2217 + \u03c8\u2217ext) = \u03bd\u2207\u22172\u03c9\u2217, \u2207\u22172\u03c8\u2217 = \u2212\u03c9\u2217, \u2207\u22172\u03c8\u2217ext = 0, (2.1)\nwhere\nr\u2217J(a, b) \u2261 (\u2202r\u2217a)(\u2202\u03b8b)\u2212 (\u2202\u03b8a)(\u2202r\u2217b). (2.2)\nThe stars denote dimensional variables and \u03bd is the kinematic viscosity. The \u03c8\u2217ext(r\n\u2217, \u03b8, t\u2217)\nterm is an external irrotational strain field that has the form\n\u03c8\u2217ext(r\n\u2217, \u03b8, t\u2217) = A\u02c6r\u2217meim(\u03b8\u2212\u03b1extt\n\u2217) + c.c. , (2.3)\nwhile the internal stream function \u03c8 is taken to have no algebraic growth at infinity. This\nstrain field has an m\u2212fold symmetry in the \u03b8\u2013direction and constant amplitude A\u02c6, while\nits axes rotate with a constant angular velocity \u03b1ext > 0.\nThis paper focuses on the time evolution of a point vortex, with circulation \u0393 > 0,\nspreading viscously in the external strain field (2.3). Both rotate in the same direction,\notherwise the problem is not very interesting as there are no cat\u2019s eyes generated. As the\ninitial vortex has no length scale, the only parameters in the problem are \u0393, \u03bd, \u03b1ext and\nA\u02c6. We non\u2013dimensionalise by setting\nt = \u03b1extt\n\u2217, r = (\u03b1ext\/\u0393)\n1\/2\nr\u2217,\nand the governing equations become\n\u2202t\u03c9 + J(\u03c9, \u03c8 + \u03c8ext) = R\n\u22121\u22072\u03c9, \u22072\u03c8 = \u2212\u03c9, \u22072\u03c8ext = 0, (2.4)\n\u03c8ext(r, \u03b8, t) = Ar\nmeim(\u03b8\u2212t) + c.c.. (2.5)\nHere R = \u0393\/\u03bd is the Reynolds number based on the original total circulation and A is\nthe dimensionless amplitude of the strain field, given by\nA =\nA\u02c6\n\u03b1ext\n(\u03b1ext\n\u0393\n)2\u2212m\n. (2.6)\nFor the case m = 2 the non\u2013dimensional amplitude is simply the ratio of the dimensional\nstrain amplitude to the dimensional strain frequency. The problem is parameterised by\njust two quantities (R,A), and can be thought of as a point vortex of unit circulation\nevolving in time t with a viscosity R\u22121 while exposed to a strain of unit angular velocity\nand amplitude A.\nWith no external strain field (A = 0) the point vortex is subject only to viscous\nspreading, and is given by\n\u03c9(r, t) =\n1\n4piL(t)2\ne\u2212r\n2\/4L(t)2 , L(t) =\n\u221a\nt\nR\n, (2.7)\nwhere L(t) is a characteristic length scale, the width of the vortex. For numerical purposes\nwe have to start with a vortex of small but finite width L0: the very early evolution of a\nspreading point vortex is unaffected by the external strain and so this is not a significant\ndrawback. This is equivalent to beginning our simulation, not at t = 0 with a point\nvortex, but at the later time t0, where L0 = (t0\/R)\n1\/2. Our simulations thus run from\nt = t0 and when we present our numerical results we will specify the value of t0 used\nTwo\u2013dimensional axisymmetric vortices exposed to a rotating strain field 5\nfor each Reynolds number; the quantity t is always the time after starting with a point\nvortex and we define \u03c4 = t\u2212 t0.\nStarting with the initial axisymmetric vorticity field (2.7) for some given L0, the ex-\nternal strain field with m 6= 0 distorts the vortex into a non\u2013axisymmetric state. In the\npresent work we shall consider the case m = 2, as m = 1 is a pure translation mode and\nthis is of no dynamical interest. Although we only consider m = 2 here, we expect quan-\ntitatively similar results for m > 2. Because we cannot begin our numerical computations\nwith a point vortex (t0 = 0), we have an initial transient where the non\u2013axisymmetric\ncomponents of the vorticity increase in magnitude rapidly and oscillate. To stop this\ninitial transient affecting our results we gradually switch on our forcing by using\nA(t) =\n{\nA sin(pit\/(2T )) for t < T,\nA for t > T,\n(2.8)\nwhere T is some given time. Extensive testing has shown that results with the forcing (2.8)\nare in excellent agreement with those where t0 has been made as low as computationally\npossible so that the initial transient is small.\nThe evolution of \u03c9(r, \u03b8, t) and \u03c8(r, \u03b8, t) is then found by time\u2013stepping (2.4), where we\nseek a solution in the form of a truncated sum of Fourier harmonics\n\u03c9(r, \u03b8, t) =\nN\u2211\nk=\u2212N\n\u03c9mk(r, t)e\nimk\u03b8, \u03c8(r, \u03b8, t) =\nN\u2211\nk=\u2212N\n\u03c8mk(r, t)e\nimk\u03b8.\nThe external strain field \u03c8ext in (2.5) drives the m = 2 mode of the vorticity field\nwhich then excites higher Fourier harmonics, as well as modifying the basic profile \u03c90\nvia the nonlinear terms J(\u03c9, \u03c8 + \u03c8ext) of (2.4). To integrate (2.4) we use the Crank\u2013\nNicholson method on the linear terms and the second order Adams\u2013Bashforth method\non the nonlinear terms. The discretisation in the radial direction uses a finite difference\nmethod with M grid points in the range 0 \u2264 r \u2264 r0. The Poisson equation for \u03c8 in (2.4)\nis solved for \u03c8(r, \u03b8, t) by inverting a tridiagonal matrix system. The code uses N Fourier\nharmonics and for this study typical resolution values are (N,M, r0) = (128, 1500, 6) for\nR = 103 and 104 while (N,M, r0) = (128, 1500, 1.5) for R = 10\n5.\nIn order to measure the response of the vortex we define the jth multipole moment of\nthe vorticity field as\nQj(t) =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nrj\u03c9j(r, t) r dr (j \u2265 1),\nwhich is related to the far\u2013field form of the (internal) stream function via 2j\u03c8j \u223c Qj(t)r\u2212j\nas r \u2192\u221e. To quantify the effect of the strain field on the vortex we consider the following\ndiagnostics: the value of the vorticity field at the origin \u03c9or(t) \u2261 \u03c9(0, \u03b8, t) and the width\nof the vortex, \u03c3(t), which we define as\n\u03c3 =\n1\u221a\npi\n\u222b 2pi\n0\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nr\u03c9(r, t) r dr d\u03b8 = 2\n\u221a\npi\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nr2\u03c90(r, t) dr.\nWhen there is no external strain field, A = 0, the quantities \u03c9or(t) and \u03c3(t) are, from\n(2.7),\n\u03c9or(t) = R\/4pit, \u03c3(t) = (t\/R)\n1\/2. (2.9)\nBefore we present the results of the simulations, we first discuss the critical layer intro-\nduced by the strain field and discuss further how a resonant response can occur in the\nvortex.\n6 M. R. Turner and Andrew D. Gilbert\n3. Resonant behaviour from inviscid theory\nConsider an axisymmetric vortex with an azimuthally averaged vorticity profile \u03c90(r, t)\nin the external strain field (2.5) rotating with angular velocity \u03b1ext. (In non\u2013dimensional\nvariables \u03b1ext = 1, but it is more intuitive to leave \u03b1ext general in this discussion section).\nThis axisymmetric vortex has the angular velocity\n\u03b1(r, t) =\n1\nr2\n\u222b r\n0\n\u03c90(s, t) s ds,\nwhich for the diffusing point vortex profile given in (2.7) is\n\u03b1(r, t) =\n1\n2pir2\n(\n1\u2212 e\u2212r2\/4L(t)2\n)\n.\nFirst for simplicity we focus on a fixed vortex, a Gaussian vortex with L(t) = 1, and\nignore viscous spreading and other time\u2013dependence. With no external forcing present\n(A = 0), there is a single radius at which infinitesimally thin, steadily rotating, inviscid\ncat\u2019s eyes can persist (Le Dize`s, 2000): we denote this radius by rcat, for which the\ncorresponding angular velocity is \u03b1cat given by \u03b1(rcat) = \u03b1cat, and we have\nrcat ' 3.44, \u03b1cat ' 0.0127 (L(t) = 1). (3.1)\nThe radius rcat is calculated by solving a linear problem with a jump condition at the\ncritical radius rcat; the jump captures information from a critical layer, in which there\nis an inner, inviscid, nonlinear solution of cat\u2019s eyes on a smaller length\u2013scale (Le Dize`s,\n2000). The particular radius rcat(t) occurs when the corresponding mode to the linearized\nequation is neutral. This study was extended by Turner et al. (2008) to include finite\nthickness cat\u2019s eyes by calculating the corresponding Landau pole of the azimuthal aver-\naged profile \u03c90(r, t) (Briggs et al., 1970; Turner and Gilbert, 2007). In short, the vortex\nhas a natural inviscid, \u2018resonant\u2019 radius rcat.\nInviscid, thin cat\u2019s eyes can exist at other radii but to be sustained these require a\nnon\u2013zero external forcing amplitude A 6= 0. A strain field of angular frequency \u03b1ext\nproduces a critical layer at r = rext which satisfies \u03b1(rext) = \u03b1ext (provided a solution\nrext exists). Here the fluid particles of the vortex co\u2013rotate with the strain field and a\ncat\u2019s eye topology forms in the co\u2013rotating stream function\n\u03c8co(r, \u03b8, t) = \u03c8(r, \u03b8, t) +\n1\n2\u03b1extr\n2; (3.2)\nby advection this subsequently generates cat\u2019s eye features in the vorticity field. One key\nquestion is what is the effective Reynolds number Reff in the cat\u2019s eyes? As these have\na scale of order A1\/2 and turnover time scale of order A\u22121\/2, the quantity Reff could be\nrather smaller than the nominal R. The sensible definition is\nReff = A\n3\/2R, (3.3)\nwhich is essentially the inverse of the Haberman parameter of Le Dize`s (2000) (also see\nHaberman (1972)). This definition also arises in the critical layer analysis of Hall et al.\n(2003). When the external frequency is tuned so that rcat = rext at large Reff , there is\na resonance effect and the non\u2013axisymmetric perturbation vorticity has a large increase\nin amplitude.\nWith viscosity, that is for moderate or small Reff but R\u001d 1, again a non\u2013zero external\namplitude A is required to sustain cat\u2019s eyes at any radius, and the radius of peak response\nmoves outwards slightly from rcat with increasing viscosity. This resonance was seen in\nthe study of Lingevitch and Bernoff (1995) who considered linear perturbations to the\nprofile (2.7) with L(t) = 1. These authors found that a peak in the perturbation vorticity\nTwo\u2013dimensional axisymmetric vortices exposed to a rotating strain field 7\n 0\n 0.1\n 0.2\n 0.3\n 0.4\n 0.5\n 0.6\n 0.7\n 0  0.05  0.1  0.15  0.2\nL\nrext\nr\nqmr\ncat\nFigure 2. Plot of rext (solid), rcat (dashed) and rqm (dotted) as functions of L for the profile (2.7)\nand \u03b1ext = 1. Both the cat\u2019s eye radius (rcat = 3.44L) and the quasi\u2013mode radius (rqm = 4.22L)\nare linear functions of L.\ndoes exist and that in the limit R\u2192\u221e this peak occurs at\nrext = 3.69, with \u03b1ext = 0.0113, (3.4)\nfor this value of L. This is different from the values of rcat and \u03b1cat given in (3.1), and\nthe reason is that even though this result is obtained in the limit R \u2192 \u221e, linearisation\ncorresponds to A\u2192 0 with Reff \u2192 0: thus the results correspond to forced, highly viscous\ncat\u2019s eyes. Taking viscosity into account Le Dize`s (2000) determined the resonant value\nin (3.4) with an error of less than 0.1%.\nHaving discussed cat\u2019s eyes on a fixed Gaussian profile with L(t) \u2261 1 we now restore\nthe viscous spreading and use the discussion above of the inviscid case as a guide. We\nwill find that the behaviour at a given time t with a given L(t) is linked to the above case\nwith L(t) appropriately rescaled, and observe increasing improvement at larger Reynolds\nnumbers. If we consider the diffusing Gaussian solution in (2.7) then we can calculate\nboth rcat and rext for varying L(t): the value where these agree should give us an estimate\nfor the value of L at which resonance will occur. To calculate rext we require the solution\nof\n1\n2pir2ext\n(\n1\u2212 e\u2212r2ext\/4L2\n)\n= \u03b1ext\nfor a given value of L, which is found using an interval halving iterative scheme for a\nparticular \u03b1ext. To calculate rcat we use the numerical method of Le Dize`s (2000), and\nwe plot both rcat and rext as a function of L in figure 2 for \u03b1ext = 1. The radius rcat\nis linear in L and has the form rcat = 3.44L, while rext = 1\/(2pi\u03b1ext)\n1\/2 at L = 0 and\nvanishes when L = 1\/(8pi\u03b1ext)\n1\/2. After this point a resonant radius connected to the\nexistence of cat\u2019s eyes ceases to exist.\nFrom figure 2 we see that rcat and rext cross when Lcat ' 0.113 and rcat = rext ' 0.389.\nThis result suggests that in our simulations we should see resonant effects when \u03c9or = \u03c9cat\nand \u03c3 = Lcat from (2.9). In summary this is\n\u03c3 = Lcat ' 0.113, rcat = rext ' 0.389, \u03c9cat = \u03c9or ' 6.23. (3.5)\nThe discussion in the paragraph immediately above, together with figure 2 is strictly\nonly valid for inviscid, infinitesimally thin cat\u2019s eyes in the limits A \u2192 0, Reff \u2192 \u221e,\nby Le Dize`s (2000). We are solving an initial problem numerically and while in theory\n8 M. R. Turner and Andrew D. Gilbert\nsuch cat\u2019s eyes may emerge cleanly in the limit t \u2192 \u221e for a run with Reff \u001d 1 and\nA \u001c 1, such runs are extremely difficult to perform (though see the development of\ncat\u2019s eyes in the asymptotic model of Balmforth et al., 2001). Nonetheless the resonance\nphenomenon is real and the above discussion gives a useful guide as to the phenomena\nwe may expect in our simulations of viscously spreading vortices subject to an applied\nexternal forcing. Although our discussion is for cat\u2019s eyes, on a Gaussian profile, that are\ninviscid Reff \u2192\u221e, and have infinitesimal width, A\u2192 0, we will find the above thresholds\nto be approximately correct for viscous, finite thickness cat\u2019s eyes on the profiles that are\nnot always very close to Gaussian, particularly near the vortex periphery. The work of\nLingevitch and Bernoff (1995), shows that for finite effective Reynolds numbers Reff the\nposition of the peak perturbation vorticity values moves to smaller angular velocities,\ni.e. to larger radii, for a Gaussian profile. On the other hand Turner et al. (2008) show\nthat if the cat\u2019s eyes have finite thickness, then the position of rcat moves to smaller\nradii. However for both of these studies the deviation of the radius from the inviscid\nresult is small, and so the inviscid analysis gives useful guidance. In fact given that our\nsimulations have a profile evolving with time and possessing more complex structure, it\nwould be impossible to pin down these effects precisely in any case.\nAlong with rext and rcat there is a third radius of interest to us as a point of comparison,\nwhich we call rqm. This radius is the \u2018quasi\u2013mode\u2019 radius of the vortex profile. A quasi\u2013\nmode is essentially a wave located in the core of a vortex and, although it appears as a\nsingle mode, it is in fact more accurate to characterize it as a wave packet of continuum\nmodes. The quasi\u2013mode itself is a solution of the linearized Euler equations which is not\nseparable in time and it decays exponentially on a time\u2013scale that is much longer than\nthe turn\u2013over time\u2013scale of the underlying vortex; together with decay it possesses a\nfrequency \u03b1qm that corresponds to the radius rqm through \u03b1qm = \u03b1(rqm) (Briggs et al.,\n1970; Schecter et al., 2000; Turner and Gilbert, 2007). For the Gaussian vortex (2.7), it\ncan been calculated that rqm ' 4.22L while the corresponding \u03b1qm = 0.0089L\u22122. The\nradii rcat and rqm for the profile (2.7) are plotted in figure 2. The corresponding values for\na resonance between the external frequency and the quasi\u2013mode, rqm = rext, are given\nby\n\u03c3 = Lqm ' 0.094, rqm = rext ' 0.397, \u03c9qm = \u03c9or ' 9.01. (3.6)\nThese are not far from those for the resonance with inviscid cat\u2019s eyes in (3.5). Note\nthat in the limit of a compact vortex, for example a Rankine vortex, with weak vorticity\noutside, the two radii rqm and rcat coincide (Balmforth et al., 2001; Le Dize`s, 2000), but\nfor general profiles they are distinct.\n4. Results for R = 103 and R = 104\nIn the next two sections we present results from our numerical simulations. In this\nsection we start by considering the moderate Reynolds numbers of R = 103 and R = 104.\nIn the R = 103 case, viscosity rapidly destroys any fine scale structures that form in the\nvorticity field, and the vortex itself quickly spreads, while in the R = 104 case we are\nbetter able to study the critical layer interactions as the vortex spreads more slowly.\nWe group together the R = 103 and 104 cases as the phenomena observed are similar.\nHowever the picture becomes more complex at larger Reynolds numbers and we examine\nthe vortex evolution in more detail for R = 105 in \u00a75 where the diffusion rate is very slow\nand our simulations are approaching the inviscid limit. For the values of R considered\nin this section, the simulations are started with the vorticity profile given by (2.7) with\nTwo\u2013dimensional axisymmetric vortices exposed to a rotating strain field 9\nx x x\n\u22120.6\n\u22120.6\n0.60.6 0.6\u22120.6 \u22120.6\u22120.6\n\u03c4=30 \u03c4=60 \u03c4=90\n\u03c4=120 \u03c4=150 \u03c4=180\n0.6\n0.6\ny\ny\nFigure 3.

Our simulations thus commence at\nt0 = 0.9 for R = 10\n3 and at t0 = 16 for R = 10\n4.\n4.1. Moderate forcing amplitude A = 0.05\nWe begin with a strain field with strength A = 0.05 which is moderate, in the middle\nof the range we study. Figure 3 plots the vorticity field, \u03c9(r, \u03b8, t), for this case and\nR = 104 at time intervals \u03c4 = t \u2212 t0 from 30 to 180 in increments of 30. This process\nis reasonably viscous with Reff ' 112. At early times, \u03c4 = 30, the vortex spreads as a\npoint vortex would do in the absence of an external strain field. However by \u03c4 = 60 the\nforcing has become significant: two spiral arms of vorticity have been pulled out and are\nwrapping up into cat\u2019s eyes around an elongated elliptical core. By \u03c4 = 90 the core is\nnow very elongated and the filaments have reconnected with the vortex giving a \u2018halo\u2019\neffect around the vortex, encasing the cat\u2019s eyes. At \u03c4 = 120 we can see the vorticity\nfrom the core spreading rapidly to fill the space between the coherent core and the halo\nregion. Beyond this time it is difficult to see any dynamical effects in the vorticity field\nand the vortex now appears as a diffusing elliptical vortex. However we can gain more\nqualitative information by considering plots of both \u03c90(r, t) and |\u03c92(r, t)| for this case\nand the R = 103 case.\nFigures 4 and 5 plot (a) profiles \u03c90(r, t) and (b) components |\u03c92(r, t)| for R = 103\nand 104 respectively, at a sequence of times with the linestyles given in the captions. For\nR = 103 in figure 4(a) \u03c90(r, t) has a clear flat region for \u03c4 = 10 (solid line) at r ' 0.5,\nand for \u03c4 = 20 (dotted line) the profile has a weak tendency to flatten at r ' 0.35. These\ndeformations correspond to the existence of spiral filaments similar to those in figure 3\n(except smaller), and a large value of |\u03c92(r, t)| in figure 4(b). Beyond this time \u03c90(r, t)\nappears as a diffusing Gaussian, and as the maximum value of |\u03c92(r, t)| decays so the\nvortex axisymmetrizes.\nHowever for R = 104, \u03c90(r, t) in figure 5(a) for the early time (solid line) appears\nalmost Gaussian while |\u03c92(r, t)| in figure 5(b) has a hump with the peak at r ' 0.12. At\n\u03c4 = 60 (dotted line), when spiral filaments are observed in the vorticity field, \u03c90(r, t) has\na region of homogenized vorticity between r ' 0.4 and r ' 0.6 which is approximately\nthe region of the cat\u2019s eyes in figure 3. This flattening is accompanied by an increase of\n10 M. R. Turner and Andrew D. Gilbert\n(a) r\n0\u03c9\n(b)\n|\u03c9  |2\nr\nFigure 4.

As time increases to \u03c4 = 90 (dashed line) \u03c90(r, t) in\nfigure 5(a) overturns and gains a second peak at r ' 0.47 as the critical layer of the strain\nfield, rext, moves towards r = 0, and |\u03c92(r, t)| reaches its maximum value at r ' 0.1. The\nvorticity then spreads rapidly and \u03c90(r, t) has a profile with a small flattened region at\nr ' 0.35 for \u03c4 = 150 and 180. At these times |\u03c92(r, t)| has a broad peak structure, lower\nin value much like the R = 103 case, and the vortex spreads and axisymmetrizes.\nAt this point, the comparison with the resonance values, in particular (3.5), is some-\nwhat unclear: however in figure 5(b) the \u03c92 harmonic does develop a clear large peak at\na radius r ' 0.1 at time \u03c4 = 90, which is linked to the formation of cat\u2019s eyes. To clarify\nthis, we reduce the amplitude A in the next subsection.\n4.2. Weak forcing amplitude A = 0.001\nBefore looking at further diagnostics and aspects of resonance, we reduce the forcing\namplitude, so as to compare profiles with the linear results of Lingevitch and Bernoff\n(1995) for a Gaussian vortex. We consider the forcing amplitude A = 0.001 for R = 104\nand plot \u03c90(r, t) and |\u03c92(r, t)| from \u03c4 = 30 to 180 in increments of 30 as shown in figures\n6(a) and 6(b) respectively. Because A is small, \u03c90(r, t) appears to be just a decaying\nTwo\u2013dimensional axisymmetric vortices exposed to a rotating strain field 11\n(a) r\n0\u03c9\n(b)\n|\u03c9  |2\nr\nFigure 6.

At \u03c4 = 30 (solid\nline) |\u03c92(r, t)| has a single peak structure, with the peak maximum at r ' 0.1. However\nas t increases a second peak emerges around r ' 0.37, and by \u03c4 = 90 this peak is now\ndominating |\u03c92|. This second peak reaches its maximum value between \u03c4 = 90 (dashed\nline) and \u03c4 = 120 (dot\u2013dashed line) while the first peak has now disappeared completely\nby \u03c4 = 120. This second peak then slowly decays away beyond this point. This second\npeak is the resonant effect of the strain field and we expect this to be important once\nthe amplitude of the forcing reaches some critical value. The fact that |\u03c92| is not close to\nzero in the range 0.1 < r < 0.25, say, shows that as well as exciting the critical layer, the\nforcing also significantly distorts the vortex core, akin to a normal mode on a Rankine\nvortex (see Balmforth et al., 2001).\nThe shape of |\u03c92(r, t)| in figure 6(a) agrees well with the linear study of Lingevitch and\nBernoff (1995). The agreement is not perfect, but this is unsurprising: as discussed earlier,\nReff \u2192 0 in the linear viscous limit, while for the results presented here Reff = 0.316\nwhich is not particularly small. We conclude that the secondary peak for A = 0.001 in\nfigure 6(b), and that for A = 0.05 in figure 5(b), are the same phenomenon, namely the\nresonance of the external forcing and the cat\u2019s eyes generated within the vortex.\n4.3. Time development of \u03c9or(t) for all amplitudes\nFor a view of the continuous time development, rather than snapshots of profiles, figures\n7(a) and 8(a) plot the value of the vorticity at the origin \u03c9or against \u03c4 = t\u2212 t0 for A = 0,\n0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.15 labelled 1\u20136, for R = 103 and R = 104 respectively. The\ncorresponding values of Reff go from 0.0316 to 58.1 for R = 10\n3 and 0.316 to 581 for\nR = 104 (excluding the A = 0 result). The right panels, figures 7(b) and 8(b) show the\nsame results on a log\u2013log scale.\nWe can see three regimes, mostly clearly in figures 7(b) and 8(b): an initial regime of\nthe point vortex spreading, followed by a window of dynamical interaction between the\nstrain and the vortex, and then a final regime of the vortex again spreading with a power\nlaw dependence. Our focus is the second, dynamical window, roughly 5 < \u03c4 < 30 for\nR = 103 and 50 < \u03c4 < 150 for R = 104. It is here that vorticity spreads into the cat\u2019s\neyes generated by the external field and the vorticity profile is changed significantly, with\ndynamical feedback effects.\n12 M. R.

For both values of the Reynolds number\nthe result for A = 0.001 (curve 2) is indistinguishable from the A = 0 (curve 1) result.\nHowever as A is increased we see that \u03c9or begins to decay faster at early times showing\na greater rate of diffusion of the core of the vortex.\nFor R = 103, the largest values of A give a vorticity value at the origin which drops\nvery rapidly and then levels out to a decay proportional to \u03c4\u22121 for longer times. This\ndecay rate is the same as for the A = 0 case, which is to be expected as Rhines and\nYoung (1983) show that an elliptical patch of scalar spreads in a similar manner to a\ncircular patch with vorticity essentially constant on streamlines and an increased effective\ndiffusivity.

This power\u2013law decay can be\nseen more clearly in the log\u2013log plot in 7(b) by comparing with the line giving the slope\n\u03c4\u22121.\nAs A is increased for the R = 104 case in figure 8(a) we see a clear trend emerging\nin the \u03c9or(t) results. In this case the vortex now spreads more slowly, because of the\ndecreased viscosity: the key effect is to open out the dynamical window, with a higher\neffective Reynolds number Reff , in the range 0.316 to 581, characterising the motions\nin the cat\u2019s eyes that form. At the start of the dynamical window the rapid decay seen\nfor R = 103 is present and enhanced, particularly at the larger values of A up to the\nA = 0.15 case where the downwards gradient of \u03c9or is very large. Comparing figure 8\nwith figure 3 we note that the homogenization of the vorticity in the cat\u2019s eyes occurs at\napproximately the same time as the rapid drop in \u03c9or(t).\nWe can now compare the time at resonance with the value when \u03c9or ' \u03c9cat predicted,\nnamely that in (3.5), and given by the upper horizontal lines in the two panels of figures\n7 and 8. In both figures there is a reasonable qualitative agreement, and in particular\nfor R = 104 in figure 8 with A = 0.05 (curve 4) this resonant value agrees well with the\nonset of the rapid drop in \u03c9or from the feedback of nonlinear terms. The discrepancy for\nlarger values of A can be accounted for by the fact that in these cases the critical layer\nis wider and also the basic profile \u03c90(r, t) has been modified by the strain field, so the\nvalues of rqm and rext have also changed: this is something we will take up in the next\nsection as we increase the Reynolds number to R = 105. At this Reynolds number it is\nnot clear if the quasi\u2013mode radius defined in (3.5) is significant in the resonant behaviour\nof the vortex because \u03c9or = \u03c9qm ' 9.01 appears within the dynamical window for the\nthree largest amplitude forcings. However in \u00a74.4 and in \u00a75 we shall see that this radius\nis not significant and we confirm that it is rcat which is the resonant radius. It is worth\nnoting here that from \u00a73 we know that the critical radius vanishes when L2 = 1\/8pi (with\n\u03b1ext = 1) which means that cat\u2019s eyes vanish from the co\u2013rotating stream function when\n\u03c9or ' 2. Thus we observe in figures 7(a) and 8(a) that there is a sudden, albeit slight,\nchange in the gradient of \u03c9or at this value signifying the vanishing of the cat\u2019s eyes.\n4.4. Time development of other diagnostics\nOf our diagnostics, we have obtained the most agreement with theory from the value\nof the vorticity at the origin \u03c9or(t), which is discussed in the previous section. In this\nsection we consider the time evolution of the maximum value of \u03c92, max(|\u03c92|), which\n14 M. R. Turner and Andrew D.

The horizontal\nline corresponds to the resonant value (3.5).\nalso agrees well with the theory, and the other diagnostics, the width \u03c3(t) and far field\namplitude Q2(t) which are less informative.\nIn figure 9 we plot the evolution of max(|\u03c92|) for A = 0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.15\nwith the same line numbering as in figures 7 and 8 for (a) R = 103 and (b) R = 104\nrespectively. For R = 103 we see that max(|\u03c92|) rises to a maximum value before decaying\nfor larger times. This maximum value occurs at a time which agrees well with the time\nwhen \u03c9or = \u03c9cat in figure 7. For the two largest forcing values, there exist oscillations in\nmax(|\u03c92|) which occur after the decay of the initial maximum. This is due to a feedback\nfrom the higher Fourier modes advecting vorticity around the cat\u2019s eyes, which becomes\nmore pronounced as R increases. The corresponding figure for R = 104 in figure 9(b)\nhas very similar features. For \u03c4 < 10 we see an increase in the value of max(|\u03c92|) as\nthe forcing is gradually switched on. Then, for the largest forcing amplitudes (lines 4,\n5 and 6), we see a kink in this diagnostic before the maximum value occurs. This kink\noccurs when the second peak in |\u03c92| (see figure 6(b)) becomes large enough so that it is\nnow the dominant peak in |\u03c92| and hence the value determined by max(|\u03c92|). Again the\nmaximum value of max(|\u03c92|) agrees well with the time when \u03c9or = \u03c9cat in figure 8, but\nin this case the feedback oscillations are also observed in the A = 0.05 result as well as\nfor larger values of A.\nFigure 10(a) plots \u03c3(t) for A = 0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.15 with the same line\nnumbering as in figure 8 for R = 104. This figure shows that as the value of \u03c9or(t)\ndrops rapidly (see figure 8(a)) the width of the vortex \u03c3(t) increases rapidly. The rapid\nincrease in \u03c3(t) ends once the cat\u2019s eyes have vanished from the vortex (approximately\nequal to the time when \u03c9or ' 2), and then \u03c3 grows like \u03c3 \u221d t1\/2 for large times. However\nwe observe that the largest forcing values give a \u03c3 which oscillates for a period of time\nbefore settling down to a smooth growth for large times. This pulsation of the vortex\nis a result of the basic vorticity profile being rearranged as a large amount of vorticity\nspreads into the cat\u2019s eyes, shown in figure 4(a).\nFigure 10(b) plots log |Q2(t)| for the same values of A (except A = 0) as in panel\n10(a) for R = 104. We see that for each value of A, |Q2| rapidly rises in value reaching\na peak around the same time as \u03c9or = \u03c9cat in figure 8(a). After this rise, |Q2(t)| then\ndecays slightly before ultimately growing slowly in time. This final regime of slow growth\ncorresponds to the slow propagation of the |\u03c92(r, t)| peak to larger values of r, as shown\nTwo\u2013dimensional axisymmetric vortices exposed to a rotating strain field 15\n(a)\n 0\n 4\n 8\n 12\n 16\n 0  500  1000  1500  2000\n\u03c4\n\u03c9 or\n1\n2\n3\n456\n(b)\n 1\n 4\n 16\n 10  100  1000\n\u03c4\n\u03c9 or\n6\n5\n4\n3\n1&2\nFigure 11.

The large values of A have a secondary increase in |Q2| which ends at the\ntime when \u03c3(t) stops its rapid increase in figure 10(a).\nThe results presented in this section for R = 103 and 104 highlight the presence of\nthe dynamical window of interaction between vortex and external strain. The picture is\nnot entirely clear though: as the vortex spreads outwards, it passes through this window\nquite quickly. It is therefore only at the stronger forcing amplitudes that we see strong\ninteractions. Having discussed these cases we are ready to open up the dynamical window\nwider by considering simulations with R = 105.\n5. Results for R = 105\nIn this section we examine how the strain field affects the point vortex in a more\ninviscid situation with R = 105. The aim of this section is to extend the time period\nwhere the vortex has dynamical interactions so we can understand the phenomena of the\nrapid drop of \u03c9or seen in \u00a74.\n5.1. Time development of diagnostics for all amplitudes\nFor R = 105 the viscous decay of the vortex occurs so slowly, on a time scale of O(R),\nthat we have to choose the initial starting time t0 with care so as to capture the behaviour\nin the dynamical window, rather than the uninteresting regimes before and after it. We\nhave therefore chosen the initial condition (2.7) with L0 = 0.07 and so our simulations\ncommence at t0 = 490. For this case the smoothing turnoff time is T = 100. The value\nof L0 is chosen because it is sufficiently close to Lcat = 0.113 where we have observed\nresonant behaviour for smaller Reynolds numbers. However it is still small enough so that\nany transient behaviour from the initial condition can die away and we have a smooth\ntransition to the dynamical window in figure 11. This figure plots \u03c9or(t) for A = 0, 0.001,\n0.0025, 0.005, 0.01 and 0.02 numbered 1 to 6 respectively.\nIn figure 11, and additionally in figure 12, where we plot (a) max(|\u03c92|), (b) \u03c3(t) and (c)\nlog |Q2(t)| against \u03c4 , we see similar results as for the smaller Reynolds number cases in\nfigures 7\u201310. The results for A = 0.001, 0.0025 and 0.005 (curves 1\u20133) are relatively low\namplitude results (Reff ' 3, 12.5 and 35 respectively) and the rapid decay occurs at the\nend of the values of \u03c4 considered and beyond.

For the cases A = 0.01 and 0.02 (curves 4 and 5) the effective Reynolds number\nis much larger (Reff ' 100 and 283) and the rapid drop in \u03c9or observed occurs within\nour dynamical window.\nFor the moment we note that for all results with A 6= 0 we see that the point at which\nthe horizontal resonance line \u03c9or = \u03c9cat from (3.5) first crosses each curve corresponds to\nthe point where the results begin to separate from the A = 0 result and the point at which\nmax(|\u03c92|) reaches its maximum value in figure 12(a). This corresponds to the resonance\noccurring with rext = rcat and not with rext = rqm which would occur at \u03c9or = \u03c9qm in\n(3.6). This confirms the relevance of the inviscid radius rcat, and corresponding frequency\n\u03b1cat, at which infinitesimal cat\u2019s eyes can form, computed by Le Dize`s (2000).\nThe difference between the diagnostics plotted in figure 12 for R = 105 compared to\nthe lower Reynolds number versions in figures 9\u201310 is the inclusion of fine scale structure.\nIn the low Reynolds number figures this structure is quickly damped out by viscosity and\nso is not observed. This structure is due to the rapid advection of vorticity around the\ncat\u2019s eyes that have been generated.\n5.2. Weak forcing amplitudes A = 0.001, 0.0025\nIn figure 13 we plot the vorticity field \u03c9(r, \u03b8, t) for a strain amplitude A = 0.0025 at\ntimes \u03c4 = 600 to 1600 in increments of 200.

Although\nthis amplitude is approximately the same as the smallest non\u2013zero value used in figures\n6, 7 and 8, the effective Reynolds number is now much larger, with Reff = 12.3, and so\nresults are typical of a large Reynolds number R for the whole vortex, but moderate or\nsmall effective Reynolds number Reff in the critical layer. The resulting basic vorticity\nprofile \u03c90(r, t) and first Fourier harmonic |\u03c92(r, t)| for these panels are plotted in figures\n14(a) and 14(b) respectively.\nIn figure 13 we see that for \u03c4 = 600 the vortex is approximately axisymmetric; the\ncorresponding \u03c90(r, t) (figure 14, solid) has an homogenized region at r ' 0.4 and |\u03c92(r, t)|\nhas a double peaked structure with peaks at r ' 0.35 and r ' 0.45.

The dotted line in figure 14 shows that this\ntime is around the time of the increased diffusion of vorticity at the origin: the flat region\nhas moved slightly towards r = 0 and and both peaks of |\u03c92(r, t)| have also increased\n18 M.

At \u03c4 = 1000 (dashed line in figure 14) the spiral arms are beginning to\nemanate from the vortex in figure 13 and the magnitude of the peaks in |\u03c92| continue\nto increase until they reach their maximum value at \u03c4 = 1200 (dot\u2013dashed line). This\ncorresponds to the spiral filaments combining with the vortex again in real space. From\nthis point the peak in |\u03c92(r, t)| decreases in value and the homogenized region of vorticity\nof \u03c90(r, t) moves towards the origin in figure 14(a). This corresponds to the homogenizing\nof vorticity in the cat\u2019s eyes to give the elliptical vortex structure in figure 13.\n5.3. Larger amplitudes\nAs the external amplitude A is increased, the rapid drop in vorticity value at the origin\n\u03c9or(t) becomes more pronounced, we consider the run with A = 0.01, which is curve 5\nin figures 11 and 12. Figures 15 and 16 show \u03c9(r, \u03b8, t) along with \u03c90(r, t) and |\u03c92(r, t)|\nrespectively, for A = 0.01 from \u03c4 = 800 to 1300 in increments of 100. As in the earlier\nA = 0.0025 case, the figures indicate that \u03c9or(t) cutting the resonant value \u03c9cat at\n\u03c4 ' 800 is the point at which the spiral filaments reconnect with the vortex and begin\nto strengthen forming clear recirculating cat\u2019s eyes in the vorticity field. From figure 18\nthis is also the time at which the basic profile \u03c90(r, t) first develops a local maximum at\nr ' 0.45.\nOnce these spiral filaments have reattached, the core of the vortex becomes more\nelliptical (\u03c4 = 900) and the strength of the filaments continue to grow (\u03c4 = 1000).\nFigure 16(a) shows that \u03c90(r, t) has a flat region at r ' 0.4 for \u03c4 = 800 where the rapid\ndecrease in \u03c9or begins to occur, but at t = 900, \u03c90(r, t) (dotted line) now has a clear\nlocal maximum at r ' 0.45. This local maximum grows and moves towards the core for\n\u03c4 = 1000 and \u03c4 = 1100 and this indicates a possible reason for the resonant feedback\nof the nonlinear terms: the maximum has moved so that now \u03c9\u20320(rcat, t) > 0. A positive\ngradient of vorticity in the critical layer is generally destabilising, from the asymptotic\nstudy of Balmforth et al. (2001), and this is presumably what leads to the rapid increase\nin |\u03c92(r, t)| seen in figure 16(b); this in turn halts the further spread of the vortex.\nAs we increase the amplitude of the strain to A = 0.02 with Reff = 282.2, the largest\nused in this study, we see a strange feature in the vorticity field, which is plotted from\nTwo\u2013dimensional axisymmetric vortices exposed to a rotating strain field 19\n(a) r\n0\u03c9\n(b)\n|\u03c9  |2\nr\nFigure 16.

Initially this simulation is much like the\nother simulations in this section with spiral filaments of vorticity beginning to strengthen\nat \u03c4 = 600 and reaching their maximum value at \u03c4 = 700. The vorticity then homogenizes\nin the vortex at \u03c4 = 800, but at \u03c4 = 900 we see the intriguing feature of two sets of\ncat\u2019s eyes being visible in the vortex, although one set is much weaker than the other.\nBy \u03c4 = 1100 both sets of cat\u2019s eyes have vanished and the vortex again axisymmetrizes\nas in the other simulations in the section.\nTo understand this behaviour further we study the sequence of plots of \u03c90(r, t) and\n|\u03c92(r, t)| against r in figure 18.

Conclusions and discussion\nIn this paper we studied how a viscously spreading Gaussian vortex evolves when\nplaced in a rotating strain field which has constant angular velocity \u03b1ext and a con-\nstant amplitude A\u02c6. By choosing suitable non\u2013dimensional variables, this study becomes\na problem with two parameters, the Reynolds number R and the non\u2013dimensional ampli-\ntude A = A\u02c6\/\u03b1ext for m = 2. Equivalently we have the two competing parameters of the\nReynolds number R which controls the global evolution of the spreading vortex, and the\neffective Reynolds number Reff in (3.3) which is the appropriate value for fluid motions\nwithin the critical layer or cat\u2019s eyes. Varying these parameters yields a complex picture,\nparticularly at large Reff . Essentially, since R controls the global spread of the vortex, it\ncontrols the time the vortex spends in any kind of resonance with the external forcing, the\nwidth of the dynamical window. During such a resonance phenomenon, though, in which\ncat\u2019s eyes advect vorticity and change the profile, the appropriate Reynolds number is\nReff .\nFor R = 103, we found that the external strain field generates cat\u2019s eye topology in the\nflow field, and as the cat\u2019s eyes move towards the centre of the vortex there is a resonant\neffect which causes a rapid rearrangement of vorticity, including a rapid drop in the value\nof vorticity at the origin. Once the vortex has spread enough so that the strain field no\nlonger generates a critical radius rext in the vortex, the elliptical vortex spreads as t\n\u22121\n(Rhines and Young, 1983). As the Reynolds number R is increased we found that for\nvery low external forcings, and so Reff \u001c 1, the response is similar to that given in the\nlinear study of Lingevitch and Bernoff (1995). It is also observed that this rapid drop in\n\u03c9or occurs when vorticity forms into cat\u2019s eye structures around the time when rext takes\nthe value in (3.4): this is when the external strain frequency corresponds to the radius at\nwhich an unforced Gaussian vortex supports infinitesimally thin viscous cat\u2019s eyes. The\nrapid decay ends when the cat\u2019s eyes vanish from the vortex.\nFor large Reynolds numbers (R = 105) and large A (and so large Reff) there is a strong\nTwo\u2013dimensional axisymmetric vortices exposed to a rotating strain field 21\nresonant effect that occurs around the time when rext ' rcat, producing nonlinear be-\nhaviour. Although the vortex is only approximately Gaussian, this criterion works well.\nThis appears to be because what controls the value of rcat (and rqm) is the main, coher-\nent part of the vortex which takes an approximately Gaussian form: the less organised\nvorticity near the periphery, which is wound into the cat\u2019s eyes, is less important. This\nmakes \u03c9or(t), the amplitude of the vortex core, the best measure of this threshold. The\nformation of broad cat\u2019s eyes generates a big region into which the vorticity can spread\nrapidly. This rapid spreading of the vortex, coupled with the large amplitude of the forc-\ning, generates vorticity fields where we observe two sets of cat\u2019s eyes. We also observe in\nthe vorticity field plots of figure 17 that the vorticity is strongly mixed at the periphery\nof the vortex, akin to the surf zones seen in Charlton et al. (2004), and one of our future\nobjectives is to quantify this mixing.\nWe noted that the quasi\u2013mode radius rqm has no obvious dynamical influence on the\nresonant behaviour of the vortex. This clears up the discussion from Turner and Gilbert\n(2007): here a vortex was forced at the external frequency \u03b1qm and thresholds were\nobtained for the formation of cat\u2019s eyes at the radius rqm. However these cat\u2019s eyes are of\nfinite width, and it is more natural to force at the frequency \u03b1cat (called \u03b1LD in Turner\nand Gilbert (2007)) for which the vortex can support cat\u2019s eyes of infinitesimal width at\nthe corresponding radius (Le Dize`s, 2000). It is at this frequency \u03b1cat that we see the\nresonant response in our forced, spreading vortex.\nThis study focused on a very simple, deterministic forcing of just one frequency. We\nnote that the picture is rather more complex than the case of a steady external strain\nfield \u03b1ext = 0: in that case when the vortex spreads enough to interact strongly with\nthe external strain, vorticity is stripped to infinity in the open, strain field topology,\nand the vortex is destroyed. In our case the topology of cat\u2019s eyes embedded in the flow\nmeans that any vorticity in the cat\u2019s eyes remains close to the vortex and recirculates.\nThis gives the possibility of complicated time\u2013dependence and spatial structure, as we\nhave observed. We note that in applications, having an external strain with just one\nfrequency is somewhat idealised, and one would typically expect several frequencies, or\na random time dependence containing a whole spectrum of frequencies; this is currently\nunder investigation (Turner et al., 2009).\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by the EPSRC on grant EP\/D032202\/1.
