Currently the best way to investigate their acceleration\nand propagation is by observing the \u03b3-rays produced when cosmic rays interact with\ninterstellar gas [3]. Here we report observations of an extended region of very high\nenergy (VHE, >100 GeV) \u03b3-ray emission correlated spatially with a complex of giant\nmolecular clouds in the central 200 pc of the Milky Way. The hardness of the \u03b3-ray\nspectrum and the conditions in those molecular clouds indicate that the cosmic rays\ngiving rise to the \u03b3-rays are likely to be protons and nuclei rather than electrons.\nThe energy associated with the cosmic rays could have come from a single supernova\nexplosion around 104 years ago.\n1\nThe observations described here were carried out with the High Energy Stereoscopic System\n(H.E.S.S.), a system of four imaging atmospheric-Cherenkov telescopes [4]. The instrument oper-\nates in the Teraelectronvolt energy range (TeV), beyond the regime accessible to satellite-based\ndetectors (MeV up to \u223c10 GeV). At satellite energies, the technique of probing the distribution\nof cosmic rays (CRs) using \u03b3-ray emission has been demonstrated in the large-scale mapping of\nthe Galactic plane by EGRET [5]. The \u03b3-ray flux was found to approximately trace the density\nof interstellar gas, illustrating that the flux of CRs is roughly constant throughout the Galaxy.\nHowever, given its modest angular resolution (\u223c 1\u25e6), EGRET could only resolve the few nearest\nmolecular clouds. The order of magnitude better angular resolution of H.E.S.S. opens up this pos-\nsibility of resolving individual clouds out to the distance of the Galactic Centre (GC). Moreover,\nin the energy range accessible to EGRET, the picture is complicated by the contribution of cosmic\nelectrons [1] to the diffuse \u03b3-ray flux via inverse Compton (IC) scattering and Bremsstrahlung.\nIn the energy range of H.E.S.S. the dominant component of the truely diffuse \u03b3-ray emission is\nvery likely the decay of neutral pions produced in the interactions of CRs with ambient material.\nTaken together, the wide field of view (\u223c5\u25e6) and the improved angular resolution (better than\n0.1\u25e6) of H.E.S.S. have made possible the mapping of extended \u03b3-ray emission.\nEarly H.E.S.S. observations of the GC region led to the detection of a point-like source of\nVHE \u03b3-rays at the gravitational centre of the Galaxy (HESS J1745\u2212290) [6], compatible with the\npositions of the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A\u22c6, the supernova remnant (SNR) Sgr A East,\nand a GC source reported by other groups [7, 8]. A more sensitive exposure of the region in 2004\nrevealed a second source: the supernova remnant\/pulsar wind nebula G0.9+0.1 [9]. These two\nsources are clearly visible in the upper panel of Fig. 1. For previous VHE instruments such sources\nwere close to the limit of detectability. With the greater sensitivity of the H.E.S.S. instrument it is\npossible to subtract these two sources and search for much fainter emission. Subtracting the best\nfit model for point-like emission at the position of these excesses yields the map shown in Fig. 1\n(bottom). Two significant features are apparent after subtraction: extended emission spatially\ncoincident with the unidentified EGRET source 3EGJ1744-3011 (discussed elsewhere [10]) and\nemission extending along the Galactic plane for roughly 2\u25e6. The latter emission is not only very\nclearly extended in longitude l, but also significantly extended in latitude b (beyond the angular\nresolution of H.E.S.S.) with a characteristic root mean square (rms) width of 0.2\u25e6, as can be seen\nin the Galactic latitude slices shown in Fig. 2. The reconstructed \u03b3-ray spectrum for the region\n\u22120.8\u25e6 < l < 0.8\u25e6, |b| < 0.3\u25e6 (with point-source emission subtracted) is well described by a power\nlaw with photon index \u0393 = 2.29\u00b1 0.07stat \u00b1 0.20sys (Fig. 3).\nGiven the plausible assumption that the \u03b3-ray emission takes place near the centre of the\nGalaxy, at a distance of about 8.5 kpc, the observed rms extension in latitude of 0.2\u25e6 corresponds\nto a scale of \u2248 30 pc. This value is similar to that of interstellar material in giant molecular clouds\nin this region, as traced by their CO emission and in particular by their CS emission [11]. CS line\nemission does not suffer from the problem of \u2018standard\u2019 CO lines [12], that clouds are optically\nthick for these lines and hence the total mass of clouds may be underestimated. The CS data\nsuggest that the central region of the Galaxy, |l| < 1.5\u25e6 and |b| < 0.25\u25e6, contains about 3\u22128\u00d7107\nsolar masses of interstellar gas, structured in a number of overlapping clouds, which provide an\nefficient target for the nucleonic CRs permeating these clouds. The region over which the \u03b3-ray\nspectrum is integrated contains 55% of the CS emission, corresponding to a mass of 1.7\u22124.4\u00d7107\nsolar masses. At least for |l| < 1\u25e6, we find a close match between the distribution of the VHE\n\u03b3-ray emission and the density of dense interstellar gas as traced by CS emission (Fig. 1 (bottom)\nand Fig. 2).\nThe close correlation between \u03b3-ray emission and available target material in the central 200\npc of our galaxy is a strong indication for an origin of this emission in the interactions of CRs.\nFollowing this interpretation, the similarity in the distributions of CS line and VHE \u03b3-ray emission\nimplies a rather uniform CR density in the region. Since in the case of a power-law energy\ndistribution the spectral index of the \u03b3-rays closely traces the spectral index of the CRs themselves\n(corrections due to scaling violations in the CR interactions are small, \u2206\u0393 < 0.1), the measured\n\u03b3-ray spectrum implies a CR spectrum near the GC with a spectral index close to 2.3, significantly\nharder than in the solar neighbourhood (where an index of 2.75 is measured). Given the probable\n2\nproximity of particle accelerators, propagation effects are likely to be less pronounced than in the\nGalaxy as a whole, providing a natural explanation for the harder spectrum which is closer to\nthe intrinsic CR-source spectra. The main uncertainty in estimating the flux of CRs in the GC\nis the uncertainty in the amount of target material. Following [3] and using the mass estimate of\nTsuboi [11] we can estimate the expected \u03b3-ray flux from the region, assuming for the moment that\nthe GC cosmic-ray flux and spectrum are identical to those measured in the solar neighbourhood.\nFig. 3 shows the expected \u03b3-ray flux as a grey band, together with the observed spectrum. Whilst\nbelow 500 GeV there is reasonable agreement with this simple prediction, there is a clear excess\nof high energy \u03b3-rays over expectations. The \u03b3-ray flux above 1 TeV is a factor 3\u2212 9 higher than\nthe expected flux. The implication is that the number density of CRs with multi-TeV energies\nexceeds the local density by the same factor. The size of the enhancement increases rapidly at\nenergies above 1 TeV.\nThe observation of correlation between target material and TeV \u03b3-ray emission is unique and\nprovides a compelling case for an origin of the emission in the interactions of CR nuclei. In addition,\nthe key experimental facts of a harder than expected spectrum, and a higher than expected TeV\nflux, imply that there is an additional component to the GC cosmic-ray population above the\nCR \u2018sea\u2019 which fills the Galaxy. This is the first time that such direct evidence for recently\naccelerated (hadronic) CRs in any part of our galaxy has been found. The energy required to\naccelerate this additional component is estimated to be 1049 erg in the energy range 4-40 TeV\nor \u223c 1050 erg in total if the measured spectrum extends from 109 \u2212 1015 eV. Given a typical\nsupernova explosion energy of 1051 erg, the observed CR excess could have been produced in a\nsingle SNR, assuming a 10% efficiency for CR acceleration. Following such a scenario, any epoch\nof CR production must have occurred in the recent enough past that the CRs accelerated have\nnot yet diffused out of the GC region. Representing the diffusion of protons with energies of\nseveral TeV in the form D = \u03b71030 cm2s\u22121, where 1030 cm2s\u22121 is the approximate value of the\ndiffusion coefficient in the Galactic Disk at TeV energies, we estimate the diffusion time-scale to\nbe t = R2\/2D \u2248 3000(\u03b8 \/ 1\u25e6)2\/\u03b7 years, where \u03b8 is the angular distance from the GC. Due to the\nlarger magnetic field and higher turbulence in the central region compared to more conventional\nregions of the Galactic disk, the normalisation parameter \u03b7 is likely \u2264 1 and a source or sources\nof age \u223c10 kyr could fill the region |l| < 1\u25e6 with CRs. Indeed, the observation of a deficit in VHE\nemission at l = 1.3\u25e6 relative to the available target material (see Fig. 2) suggests that CRs, which\nwere recently accelerated in a source or sources in the GC region, have not yet diffused out beyond\n|l| = 1\u25e6.\nThe observed morphology and spectrum of the \u03b3-ray emission provide evidence that one or\nmore cosmic-ray accelerators have been active in the GC in the last 10,000 years. The fact that the\ndiffuse emission exhibits a photon index \u0393 which is the same - within errors - as that of the central\nsource HESS J1745\u2212290 suggests that this object could be the source in question. Within the 1\narcminute error box of HESS J1745\u2212290 are two compelling candidates for such a CR accelerator.\nThe first is the SNR Sgr A East [13] with its estimated age around 10 kyr [14] (younger ages have\nbeen quoted for Sgr A East [15] reflecting the significant uncertainty in this estimate). The second\nis the supermassive black hole Sgr A\u22c6 [16, 17] which may have been more active in the past.\nA distinct alternative possibility is that a population of electron accelerators produces the\nobserved \u03b3-ray emission via IC scattering. Extended objects with photon indices close to the value\n2.3 observed in the GC are observed elsewhere in the Galactic plane [10]. The parent population\nof objects such as pulsar wind nebulae (i.e. massive stars) would likely follow approximately the\ndistribution of molecular gas. However, in the intense photon fields and high magnetic fields\nwithin and close to the GC molecular clouds [18, 19], TeV electrons would lose their energy\nrapidly: trad \u2248 120 (B\/100\u00b5G)\n\u22122 (Ee\/10TeV)\n\u22121 years. We would therefore expect to see rather\ncompact sources (point-like for H.E.S.S.) which would also be bright in the X-ray regime (as is\nfor example G0.9+0.1). The existence of \u223c 10 such unknown sources in this small region again\nseems unlikely. Any substantially extended IC source would most likely be a foreground source\nalong the line-of-sight towards the GC region, making any correlation with GC molecular clouds\nentirely coincidental.\n3\nAcknowledgements\nThe support of the Namibian authorities and of the University of Namibia in facilitating the\nconstruction and operation of H.E.S.S. is gratefully acknowledged, as is the support by the Ger-\nman Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF), the Max Planck Society, the French Ministry\nfor Research, the CNRS-IN2P3 and the Astroparticle Interdisciplinary Programme of the CNRS,\nthe U.K. Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council (PPARC), the IPNP of the Charles\nUniversity, the South African Department of Science and Technology and National Research Foun-\ndation, and by the University of Namibia.

The 95% confidence region for the positions of the two unidentified\nEGRET sources in the region are shown as dashed green ellipses [20]. These smoothed and\nacceptance corrected images are derived from 55 hours of data consisting of dedicated observations\nof SgrA\u22c6, G 0.9+0.1 and a part of the data of the H.E.S.S. Galactic plane survey [21]. The\nexcess observed along the Galactic plane consists of \u22483500 \u03b3-ray photons and has a statistical\nsignificance of 14.6 standard deviations. The absence of any residual emission at the position\nof the point-like \u03b3-ray source G0.9+0.1 demonstrates the validity of the subtraction technique.\nThe energy threshold of the maps is 380 GeV due to the tight \u03b3-ray selection cuts applied here\nto improve signal\/noise and angular resolution. We note that the ability of H.E.S.S. to map\nextended \u03b3-ray emission has been demonstrated for the shell-type SNRs RXJ1713.7 \u22123946 [22]\nand RXJ0852.0\u22124622 [23].
