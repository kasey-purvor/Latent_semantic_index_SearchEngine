Language and theory of mind in autism spectrum disorder     3\nLanguage and theory of mind in autism spectrum disorder: The relationship between \ncomplement syntax and false belief task performance\nThe term \u201ctheory of mind\u201d (ToM) refers to the ability to attribute mental states, such \nas beliefs and desires, to self and others to explain and predict behaviour (Premack & \nWoodruff, 1978).  The ToM hypothesis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) states that \nattenuated ToM underlies the social and communication impairments that characterise \nASD (e.g., Baron-Cohen, 1989; Frith, 1989; Leslie, 1987).  False belief tasks are \nthought to index a representational ToM because successful performance requires an \nindividual to impute a false belief to a mistaken protagonist in order to correctly \npredict their behaviour (Dennett, 1978).  To succeed on such tasks, children must \nappreciate that people\u2019s actions are determined not by the real state of the world, but \nby their mental representations of the world, which may or may not be accurate.  \nThe two most commonly used types of false belief task are location change\n(Wimmer & Perner, 1983) and unexpected contents (Perner, Leekam, & Wimmer, \n1987) tasks.  In the \u201cSally-Anne\u201d location change task (Baron-Cohen, Leslie, & Frith, \n1985), the child is presented with the following scenario: \u201cSally puts her marble in the \nbasket.  Then she goes out for a walk.  While she is gone, Anne takes the marble out \nof the basket and puts it in the box.  When Sally comes back, where will she look for \nher marble?\u201d  In order to correctly predict that Sally will look in the basket, the child \nmust impute a false belief (that the marble is in the basket) to Sally.  In the \u201cSmarties\u201d \nunexpected contents task (Perner et al., 1987), the child is shown that a tube of \nSmarties contains pencils rather than the expected sweets, and is then asked what \nsomeone else, who has not seen inside the tube, will think is in there before it is \nopened.  Once again, the child must invoke the notion of a false belief in order to \nLind & Bowler (2009). Language and theory of mind in autism spectrum disorder     4\nrespond correctly.  Although ToM abilities become increasingly sophisticated during \nthe preschool years, it is not until around 4 years of age that typically developing \nchildren are able to pass false belief tasks (Wellman, Cross, & Watson, 2001).  If \nindividuals with ASD have impaired ToM, they should not be able to pass such tasks\nreliably.\nAlthough dozens of studies indicate that, as a population, individuals with \nASD have difficulty with ToM tasks, there is nonetheless a proportion of affected \nindividuals who pass such tasks in the presence of severe social and communication \nimpairments (e.g., Happ\u00e9, 1995; Yirmiya, Erel, Shaked, & Solomonica-Levi, 1998).  \nIf the core features of ASD are the result of attenuated ToM, as many researchers \nhave maintained, then such findings must be accounted for.  \nOne suggestion, which may preserve the integrity of the ToM hypothesis, is \nthat individuals with ASD use compensatory, verbally-mediated, non-ToM strategies \nto \u201chack out\u201d solutions to ToM tasks (Bowler, 1992; Happ\u00e9, 1995).  If this is the case \nthen successful ToM task performance amongst individuals with ASD does not reflect \nthe same underlying process that operates in typically developing individuals.  This \nproposal is consistent with a substantial amount of data showing a particularly strong \nrelationship between language (e.g., receptive vocabulary and grammar) and ToM \ntask performance amongst individuals with ASD (e.g., Fisher, Happ\u00e9, & Dunn, 2005; \nTager-Flusberg & Joseph, 2005).  \nDrawing on de Villiers\u2019 (e.g., 1995) work on typical development, Tager-\nFlusberg (2000) has argued that a specific type of grammatical competence \u2013 the \nsyntax of complementation \u2013 may facilitate ToM task performance in ASD.  De \nVilliers suggests that once a typically developing child has acquired complement\nsyntax and understood the semantics of complementation, they have available a new \nLind & Bowler (2009). Language and theory of mind in autism spectrum disorder     5\ncapacity for representing false beliefs.  Complementation is a syntactic process, which \nallows one propositional argument to be embedded under another proposition.  Both \ncommunication (e.g., \u201csay\u201d, \u201ctell\u201d) and mental state verbs (e.g., \u201cthink\u201d, \u201cbelieve\u201d, \n\u201cknow\u201d) can take embedded sentential complements.  For example:\n1. \u201cShe said she was drawing a face, but it was really a scribble.\u201d\n2. \u201cSally thought the marble was in the box, but it was really in the basket.\u201d\nThe semantics of complement structures mean that the embedded proposition \u2013 the \ncomplement [depicted in italics in 1 and 2 above] \u2013 can express either a true or false\nproposition, without affecting the truth value of the sentence as a whole.  It is this \nproperty of sentential complements that is said to make them ideal for representing \nfalse beliefs.  Hence, sentence 2, above, may be a true statement as a whole, despite \nthe fact that the embedded proposition (\u201cthe marble was in the box\u201d) is false.  \nDe Villiers and Pyers (2002) conducted a longitudinal study to examine the \nrelation between complement syntax competence and false belief task performance in \ntypical development.  A \u201cmemory for complements\u201d task was used to assess \ncomplement syntax competence, and location change and unexpected contents tasks \nwere used to assess false belief understanding.  The memory for complements \nparadigm involves presenting children with short stories containing embedded \ncomplements, which are followed by questions requiring the child to extract the\ncomplements from the sentences.  For example, \u201cShe said she found a monster under \nher chair, but it was really the neighbour\u2019s dog.  What did she say?\u201d The researchers\nfound that memory for complements embedded under communication verbs was\nsignificantly correlated with concurrent performance on both false belief tasks.  \nLind & Bowler (2009). Language and theory of mind in autism spectrum disorder     6\nLongitudinally, memory for communication complements predicted false belief\nunderstanding three months later, even after controlling for mean length of utterance \nand grammatical complexity.  False belief understanding did not predict later memory \nfor complements.  Two training studies also support the hypothesised link between \ncomplement syntax and false belief task performance (Hale & Tager-Flusberg, 2003; \nLohmann & Tomasello, 2003).  \nAs explained above, de Villiers argues that complement syntax provides a \nrepresentational format for encoding false beliefs.  However, this capacity is not \ntantamount to a representational ToM.  Rather, it represents an important stage in \nToM development that, amongst typically developing children, ultimately leads to a \nfully-fledged ability to reason about mental states (de Villiers & Pyers, 2002).  It is \npossible that some children with ASD utilise their knowledge of complement \nstructures to facilitate their false belief test performance, without going on to develop \na mature ToM. Indeed, some 15 years ago, Leslie and Roth (1993) proposed that \n\u201cverbally able autistic children are eventually able to exploit the fact that verbal \nexpressions lay out the structure of propositional attitudes\u2026using a unique verb-\nargument structure where the object of the verb is another sentence\u201d (pp.103-104).  \nPreviously, Tager-Flusberg (2000) and Tager-Flusberg and Joseph (2005) \nhave attempted to assess the relationship between complement syntax and ToM task \nperformance in ASD.  The results of their studies generally appear to show a positive \nrelationship between these variables amongst children with ASD. For example, \nTager-Flusberg (2000, Study 1) found that communication verb complement syntax \ncompetence significantly predicted location change false belief task performance \namongst older children and adolescents with ASD, but not amongst age- and \nlanguage-matched participants with mental retardation.  However, concerns over \nLind & Bowler (2009). Language and theory of mind in autism spectrum disorder     7\naspects of the methods used, the way these studies were reported, and the types of \nstatistical analyses used may lead to the reliability of this relationship being \nquestioned.  Tager-Flusberg\u2019s (2000) chapter does not include details of participant \ncharacteristics and, in some cases, inappropriate statistical analyses were used (e.g., \nthe use of multiple regression, including four predictor variables, with a sample size \nof only 20).  More critically, the statistics reported did not assess whether the\nrelationship between complement syntax and false belief task performance was \nsignificantly stronger within the ASD group than within the comparison group.  \nWithout comparing within-group associations, it is not possible to draw valid \nconclusions regarding the possibility that children with ASD exploit their knowledge \nof complement syntax to aid ToM task performance to a greater or lesser extent than \nchildren without ASD.  Tager-Flusberg and Joseph (2005) provided a more thorough \nreport of their study.  However, they did not include a comparison group, once again \nprecluding the possibility of addressing this question.  On the basis of these results, \nTager-Flusberg\u2019s conclusion, that children with ASD are \u201cmore reliant [than children \nwithout ASD] on the structural relationship between complements and propositional \nattitudes to bootstrap their way into a representational understanding of mind\u201d\n(p.143), seems premature.  \nThus, it is still unclear whether complement syntax competence genuinely \nplays a special role in the false belief task performance of children with ASD, \nalthough there is some suggestive evidence that this may be so.  To test this \nhypothesis, the current study adopted similar measures to those used by de Villiers \nand Pyers (2002) in their study of typically developing children.  A memory for \ncomplements task was selected as the measure of complement syntax competence, \nand the Sally-Anne location change (Baron-Cohen et al., 1985) and Smarties \nLind & Bowler (2009). Language and theory of mind in autism spectrum disorder     8\nunexpected contents (Perner et al., 1987) tasks were used to assess false belief \nunderstanding.  If knowledge of complement syntax plays a special role in the false \nbelief task performance of individuals with ASD, mastery of complement syntax \nshould be associated with performance on each of the false belief measures, and these \nassociations should each be significantly stronger within the ASD group than within \nthe comparison group.  On the basis of Tager-Flusberg\u2019s (2000, Study 1) results \nobtained with children\/adolescents with mental retardation, it was predicted that \ncomplement syntax and false belief task performance would not be significantly \nrelated within the comparison group.   \nAlthough all participants in the current study completed both false belief tasks, \ngiven that each task entails different cognitive demands, the results from each were\nconsidered separately, rather than as a composite. For example, whereas the Sally-\nAnne task involves a narrative and a relatively simple test question, the Smarties task\ndoes not involve a narrative but involves a more complex test question (Milligan, \nAstington, & Dack, 2007).  In typical development, it is generally assumed that a shift \nto a representational ToM underlies successful false belief task performance, \nregardless of task-specific factors (Wellman et al., 2001).  However, in the current \nstudy, it was postulated that successful performance in ASD might not be \nunderpinned by such a conceptual change, but rather by compensatory mechanisms.  \nBecause it could not be assumed that compensatory strategies would be deployed \nequally across different false belief problems, the tasks were considered separately.  \nLind & Bowler (2009). Language and theory of mind in autism spectrum disorder     9\nMethod\nParticipants\nApproval for this study was obtained from City University Research Ethics \nCommittee.  Participants were recruited through schools in South-East England.  The \nparents of all participants gave informed, written consent for their children to take part\nin the study.  Verbal ability was assessed using the British Picture Vocabulary Scale \n(Dunn, Dunn, Whetton, & Burley, 1997).  All participants completed the Sally-Anne \nand Smarties false belief tasks as well as the complement syntax task.  However, the \nresults are presented in two sections which include overlapping, but not identical,\nsamples of participants.  The analyses concerning the Sally-Anne and Smarties tasks \nare presented in Sections 1 and 2 of the results, respectively.  \nIn order to assess the relationship between complement syntax and false belief\ntask performance, it was essential to make certain that participants passed the control \nquestions for the relevant false belief task.  This ensured that any failure on the test \nquestion was due to a specific difficulty with representing false beliefs as opposed to \nextraneous task demands.  However, a number of participants failed the control \nquestions for one of the false belief tasks but passed the control questions for the \nother.  It was decided that such individuals should not be excluded from analyses \nconcerning the false belief task for which they had passed the control questions.  So, \nfor example, a child who failed the Sally-Anne control questions, but passed the \nSmarties control questions, would be included in the analysis of the relationship \nbetween complement syntax and Smarties task performance but excluded from the \nanalysis of the relationship between complement syntax and Sally-Anne task \nperformance.  This strategy maximised the power of the planned statistical analyses \nLind & Bowler (2009). Language and theory of mind in autism spectrum disorder     \n10\nbut meant that the participant characteristics for the Sally-Anne and Smarties samples \ndiffered somewhat.  \nThe Sally-Anne and Smarties samples each consisted of a group of \nparticipants with ASD and an age and verbal ability matched comparison group.  The \nparticipants in the ASD groups attended specialist autism schools or units, for which \nentry required a formal diagnosis of autistic disorder, Asperger\u2019s disorder, pervasive \ndevelopmental disorder not otherwise specified or atypical autism (American \nPsychiatric Association, 1994; World Heath Organisation, 1993).  All participants in \nthe current study met the criteria for autistic disorder or Asperger\u2019s disorder.  \nThe comparison groups consisted of children with general learning disability \n(to act as matches for those children with ASD who also had learning disability) and \ntypically developing children (to act as matches for those children with ASD who did \nnot have learning disability).  Potential comparison participants were excluded if they \nhad received specific diagnoses, such as dyslexia, Down syndrome or attention deficit \nhyperactivity disorder.  Any mention of social communication difficulties in any \ncomparison child\u2019s Statement of Special Educational Needs resulted in exclusion \nfrom the comparison group, as this may have been indicative of ASD-related \nsymptoms or even undiagnosed ASD.\nWithin the \u201cSally-Anne sample\u201d (which was used in Section 1 of the results),\nthe ASD group consisted of 48 children\/adolescents with autistic disorder (n = 43) or \nAsperger\u2019s disorder (n = 5), and the comparison group consisted of 48\nchildren\/adolescents with general learning disability (n = 26) or typical development \n(n = 22).  In the \u201cSmarties sample\u201d (which was used in Section 2 of the results), the \nASD group consisted of 53 children\/adolescents with autistic disorder (n = 46) or \nAsperger\u2019s disorder (n = 7), and the comparison group consisted of 53 \nLind & Bowler (2009). Language and theory of mind in autism spectrum disorder     \n11\nchildren\/adolescents with general learning disability (n = 27) or typical development \n(n = 26).  The characteristics of the ASD and comparison groups in the Sally-Anne\nand Smarties samples, respectively, are presented in Table 1.  \n[Table 1 about here]\nWithin the Sally-Anne sample, the groups did not significantly differ in terms of \nchronological age (CA), t(71.55) = 1.21, p = .23, r = .14, or verbal mental age \n(VMA), t(94) = 1.21, p = .23, r = .12.  Within the Smarties sample, the groups did not \nsignificantly differ in terms of CA, t(71.48) = 0.53, p = .59, r = .06, or VMA, t(104) = \n0.36, p = .72, r = .04.  \nMaterials and Procedure\nParticipants completed the BPVS first, then the false belief tasks, and finally the \ncomplement syntax task.  However, the order in which they completed the Sally-Anne \nand Smarties tasks was counterbalanced.  \nThe complement syntax task involved the experimenter reading 8 one-line \nstories (e.g., \u201cShe told her husband she saw a ghost but it was really a blanket.\u201d) to \nthe participant in a fixed order and, after each one, asking them a question (e.g., \n\u201cWhat did she tell her husband?\u201d) which required them to extract the complement \nembedded within it.  Each story was accompanied by two illustrative photographs.  \nThe experimenter pointed to the relevant parts of the photographs as she read the \nstories aloud.  Each story contained a complement embedded under a tensed \ncommunication verb (either \u201csay\u201d or \u201ctell\u201d).  Communication verbs, rather than \nmental state verbs, were used to avoid confounding complement syntax and ToM \nLind & Bowler (2009). Language and theory of mind in autism spectrum disorder     \n12\ncompetence.  Participants\u2019 responses were recorded verbatim at the time of testing.  \nAppendix 1 provides details of each story.  \nThe Sally-Anne procedure involved the experimenter acting-out the following \nsequence using dolls and other props, whilst describing the ongoing events: \u201cSally\u2019s \ngoing to put her marble in the blue box.  Now Sally\u2019s going out to play.  While Sally\u2019s \nout, naughty Anne takes the marble out of the blue box and puts it in the pink box.  \nWhen Sally comes back\u2026\u201d  The following questions were then asked: (a) \u201cWhere \nwill she look for her marble first?\u201d (test question); (b) \u201cWhere is the marble really?\u201d\n(reality control question); and (c) \u201cWhere was the marble in the beginning?\u201d  \n(memory control question).\nFor the Smarties task, the usual Smarties tube and pencils were substituted \nwith a \u201cPringles\u201d (well-known type of potato crisp\/chip) tube and a tennis ball.  The \nprocedure involved the experimenter removing the Pringles box from a plastic bag, \nshowing it to the child, and asking them, \u201cWhat\u2019s in here?\u201d  They were then shown \nthe true contents and told, \u201cNo, it\u2019s a ball.\u201d  The ball was then replaced and the box \nwas closed again.  The child was then asked the following questions: (a) \u201cWhat\u2019s in \nhere? (first reality control question); (b) \u201cYour teacher hasn\u2019t seen this box.  When \n(s)he comes in later, I\u2019ll show her\/him this box just like this and ask her\/him what\u2019s in \nhere.  What will (s)he say?\u201d (test question); (c) \u201cIs that what\u2019s really in the box?\u201d\n(second reality control question).\nScoring\nBoth the Sally-Anne and Smarties tasks were scored dichotomously as pass\/fail,\naccording to performance on the test questions.  For a participant\u2019s data to be \nincluded, they were required to pass the relevant control questions.  Children could \nLind & Bowler (2009). Language and theory of mind in autism spectrum disorder     \n13\nscore a maximum of eight points on the complement syntax task \u2013 one point per\nquestion.  For a response to be deemed correct, the participant had to extract the \ncomplement from the story.  However, they were not required to repeat the \ncomplement precisely, as they had heard it.  If their response captured the gist of the \ncomplement (i.e., the counterfactual state of affairs), it was coded as correct.  Any \nmention of the final clause of the sentence (which indicated the true state of affairs) \nresulted in a response being coded as incorrect.  This was because such responses \nwere considered to reflect a failure to distinguish and selectively extract the \ncomplement from the complete sentence.  Irrelevant (e.g., \u201cI was OK, I hope\u201d, \n\u201cYuk!\u201d) or \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d responses were also coded as incorrect.\nResults\nSection 1: Sally-Anne and complement syntax analyses\nThe complement syntax scores and VMAs of Sally-Anne passers and failers, within \nthe ASD and comparison groups, are displayed in Table 2.  \n[Table 2 about here]\nThe ASD and comparison groups did not differ significantly in terms of complement \nsyntax score, U = 1088.00, z = 0.49, p = .63, r = .05, indicating that they had similar \nlevels of complement syntax competence. A total of 26\/48 (54.2%) participants with \nASD passed the Sally-Anne task, compared to 40\/48 (83.3%) comparison \nparticipants.  The association between group and Sally-Anne task performance was \nLind & Bowler (2009). Language and theory of mind in autism spectrum disorder     \n14\nsignificant, \uf063\u00b2(1, N = 96) = 9.50, p < .01, \uf066 = .32, demonstrating that the ASD group \nperformed significantly less well on the task than the comparison group.  \nIn order to assess the relationship between complement syntax and Sally-Anne \ntask performance, separate correlation analyses were planned for the ASD and \ncomparison groups.  A series of preliminary correlations were computed in order to \nestablish whether any covariates should be included in the main analyses.  Within \neach group, Sally-Anne performance was significantly correlated with VMA (ASD:\nrpb = .33, p < .02; comparison: rpb = .35, p < .02) but not CA (ASD: rpb = .19, p = .20; \ncomparison: rpb = .18, p = .22).  Thus, partial correlations, controlling for the effect of \nVMA, were computed in addition to the bivariate correlations between complement \nsyntax and Sally-Anne.  Both the bivariate (ASD: rpb = .50, p < .001; comparison: rpb\n= -.03, p = .85) and partial (ASD: rpb = .44, p < .01; comparison: rpb = -.22, p = .14) \ncorrelations indicated that complement syntax was significantly associated with Sally-\nAnne performance within the ASD group only.  The bivariate correlation for the ASD \ngroup was strong and the partial correlation was moderate (Cohen, 1992).  Each of the \ncorrelations for the comparison group was weak.  It was also important to establish\nwhether complement syntax and Sally-Anne task performance were significantly \nmore strongly related within the ASD group than within the comparison group.  \nFisher\u2019s Z transformations were used to compare the coefficients for each of the \ngroups.  These analyses confirmed that both the bivariate, Zr1-r2 = 2.75, p < .01, and \npartial, Zr1-r2 = 3.30, p < .01, correlations were significantly stronger within the ASD \ngroup than within the comparison group.  \nLind & Bowler (2009). Language and theory of mind in autism spectrum disorder     \n15\nSection 2: Smarties and complement syntax analyses\nThe complement syntax scores and VMAs of Smarties passers and failers, within the \nASD and comparison groups, are displayed in Table 3.  \n[Table 3 about here]\nThe groups did not differ significantly in terms of complement syntax score, U = \n1348.00, z = -0.37, p = .71, r = .04, replicating the results from the Sally-Anne \nsample.  A total of 26\/53 (49.0%) participants with ASD passed the Smarties task, \ncompared to 35\/53 (66.0%) comparison participants.  The association between group \nand Smarties performance approached significance, \uf063\u00b2(1) = 3.13, p (one-tailed) = .06, \n\uf066 = .17.  \nPreliminary analyses were conducted as background to the planned \ncorrelations.  Within the ASD group, Smarties performance was significantly \ncorrelated with VMA, rpb = .38, p < .01, but not CA, rpb = .25, p = .07.  Within the \ncomparison group, Smarties performance was significantly correlated with VMA, rpb\n= .46, p < .01, and CA, rpb = .39, p < .01.  Thus, partial correlations, controlling for \nVMA, and VMA and CA, respectively, were computed in addition to the bivariate \ncorrelations between complement syntax and Smarties task performance.  \nThe bivariate correlations indicated that complement syntax and Smarties task \nperformance were significantly related within each group (ASD: rpb = .27, p < .05; \ncomparison: rpb = .28, p < .05).  However, these relationships did not remain \nsignificant after controlling for the effect of VMA (ASD: rpb = .15, p = .29; \ncomparison: rpb = .05, p = .75), or VMA and CA (ASD: rpb = .15, p = .30; \ncomparison: rpb =.02, p = .87).  Fisher\u2019s Z transformations indicated that neither the \nLind & Bowler (2009). Language and theory of mind in autism spectrum disorder     \n16\nbivariate nor the partial correlations between complement syntax and Smarties task \nperformance differed significantly in strength between the groups (all Zr1-r2s < 0.67, \nall ps > .51).  \nThus, in contrast to the results reported in Section 1, which showed \ncomplement syntax to be significantly correlated with Sally-Anne performance within \nthe ASD group but not the comparison group, these results indicated that complement \nsyntax was not significantly related to Smarties performance within either group after \ncontrolling for VMA and CA.  \nDiscussion\nIt was hypothesised that whereas some children with ASD may use knowledge of \ncomplement syntax as a compensatory linguistic strategy to perform successfully on \nmeasures of false belief understanding in the absence of ToM competence, amongst \nchildren without ASD, successful false belief task performance reflects their accurate \nrepresentation of others\u2019 false beliefs, and not a compensatory linguistic strategy.  \nTherefore, it was predicted that the relationship between complement syntax \ncompetence and false belief task performance would be significantly stronger within \nthe ASD group than within the comparison group. The current data provided clear \nsupport for this prediction in relation to the Sally-Anne task but, importantly, not in \nrelation to the Smarties task.\nCorrelation analyses revealed that complement syntax scores were strongly \nassociated with Sally-Anne performance (r = .50) within the ASD group.  Crucially, \ncontrolling for the effect of vocabulary only slightly weakened this relationship (r = \n.44), highlighting the specific association between Sally-Anne task performance and \nLind & Bowler (2009). Language and theory of mind in autism spectrum disorder     \n17\ncomplement syntax competence.  However, within the comparison group, \ncomplement syntax scores were not significantly correlated with Sally-Anne \nperformance (r = -.03).  \nThe current results are in close alignment with those of Tager-Flusberg (2000, \nStudy 1) who found that communication verb complement syntax competence was a \nsignificant predictor of location change false belief task performance amongst \nparticipants with ASD only, and not amongst participants with mental retardation.  \nAlthough the reliability of Tager-Flusberg\u2019s results was initially questioned, the \nconcurrence of her results with those of the present study provides reassurance about \nthe validity of her findings. However, the current study went further than Tager-\nFlusberg\u2019s by analysing whether the inter-task correlations were significantly greater\namongst individuals with ASD than amongst comparison participants.  Only a \npositive result in this regard can support the notion that complement syntax \ncompetence and false belief task performance are uniquely related (in terms of \nstrength) in ASD, as Tager-Flusberg suggests (p.135).  In fact, the current results did \nsupport this notion, showing that the inter-task correlation was significantly stronger \nfor the ASD group than the comparison group.  \nThese results, particularly in connection with those of Tager-Flusberg (2000), \nmay suggest that knowledge of complement syntax plays a special role in the Sally-\nAnne task performance of children with ASD, allowing them to succeed on this \nwidely-used false belief task in the absence of false belief competence.  Alternatively, \nas suggested by Ruffman, Slade, Rowlandson, Rumsey, and Garnham (2003), the \ndirection of causality could be opposite to this, with successful performance on such \ncomplement syntax tasks presupposing a theory of false belief.  They suggest that \n\u201cwithout such a theory\u2026the child has no basis for reconstructing what was said, and \nLind & Bowler (2009). Language and theory of mind in autism spectrum disorder     \n18\nremembering a mistaken proposition\u201d (p.141).  In the memory for complements task \nused here, for example, the protagonists in the stories could be construed as either \nlying (trying to induce a false belief in another person) or holding a false belief.  On \nthis account, a memory for complements task amounts to a type of false belief task.  \nAlthough it is never possible to infer the direction of causality from a \ncorrelation between two variables, there are notable reasons to favour the hypothesis \nthat complement syntax competence facilitates false belief task performance rather \nthan the hypothesis that false belief competence facilitates complement syntax task \nperformance.  In the current study, the ASD group demonstrated impaired false belief \nunderstanding but unimpaired memory for complements.  If the memory for \ncomplements task relied on false belief understanding, the ASD group should have \nbeen impaired on this task also.  Thus, rather than relying of false belief \nunderstanding, the task appears simply to require recall and parsing of complement \nstructures. \nFindings from previous studies also support the interpretation that these results \nreflect the fact that knowledge of complement syntax is utilised by some children with \nASD to facilitate Sally-Anne task performance.  As previously discussed, longitudinal \nstudies of typical development (e.g., de Villiers & Pyers, 2002) show that complement \nsyntax predicts later false belief task performance amongst 3- to 5-year-olds \n(independent of general linguistic ability), but false belief task performance does not \npredict later complement syntax competence.  More pertinently, Tager-Flusberg and \nJoseph (2005) found that this same pattern applied in a sample of 20 children with \nASD1.  Together these findings support the interpretation that complement syntax \nmay be used as a means of passing location change false belief tasks amongst some \nchildren with ASD. \nLind & Bowler (2009). Language and theory of mind in autism spectrum disorder     \n19\nDespite the arguments presented above, it remains the case that the design of \nthe current study was limited in terms of its ability to distinguish between competing\nexplanations of the relationship between complement syntax competence and false \nbelief task performance.  Indeed, it will be important to follow-up these findings with \nlongitudinal or training studies in order to firmly establish a causal model.  However, \nthe main purpose of this study was to establish whether complement syntax \nknowledge plays a stronger role in the false belief task performance of children with \nASD than in children without ASD.  In this respect, the current results are \ninformative, showing that in the case of the Sally-Anne task, these variables were \nsignificantly more strongly related within the ASD group than within the comparison \ngroup.  \nConsistent with the findings of Tager-Flusberg (2000), within the comparison \ngroup, the relationship between complement syntax and Sally-Anne performance did \nnot reach significance at all. By contrast, previous studies of typical development \nhave reliably demonstrated a relationship between complement syntax and location \nchange false belief task performance.  This discrepancy is likely to be attributable to \nthe fact that the characteristics of the present sample and Tager-Flusberg\u2019s sample are \nconsiderably different to those in previous studies of typical development, which have \ngenerally assessed children aged 3 to 5 years.  The current sample were not only \nconsiderably older in terms of CA (M = 9.28) but also in terms of VMA (M = 6.37) \n(Tager-Flusberg\u2019s sample was described as consisting of older children and \nadolescents with mental retardation).  This notable difference between samples may \naccount for the different patterns of results.  \nAlthough complement syntax may play an important ontogenetic role in the \ntypical development of ToM, the relationship between complement syntax and false \nLind & Bowler (2009). Language and theory of mind in autism spectrum disorder     \n20\nbelief task performance may not hold throughout the course of development.  In this \nrespect, complement syntax may still be said to play a special role in ASD, when \nconsidered in relation to the specific age and ability groups concerned.  Thus, \nalthough the relationship per se may not be unique to ASD, the strong relationship \nbetween complement syntax and location change task performance amongst \nindividuals with higher developmental levels does appear to be unique to ASD.    \nIn relation to the Smarties task, there was no evidence to suggest that children \nwith ASD were using alternative strategies to negotiate the task.  These findings are \nincompatible with the notion that children with ASD use complement syntax as a \nmeans of hacking out a solution to the Smarties task.  It is important to consider why \nthe initial predictions were confirmed in relation to the Sally-Anne but not the \nSmarties false belief task.  It is possible that task-specific factors make the Sally-Anne \ntask more conducive to the implementation of compensatory strategies.  The cognitive \nand linguistic demands of the Sally-Anne and Smarties tasks are somewhat different.  \nMost conspicuously, the Sally-Anne task involves a narrative and a relatively simple \ntest question, whereas the Smarties task does not involve a narrative but involves a \nmore complex test question. Children who have a good grasp of complement syntax \nmay have the potential to linguistically represent a false belief, but their ability to \ndeploy such representations may be dependent on multiple factors.  Moreover, the fact \nthat there were no group differences in complement syntax performance, but the ASD \ngroup performed significantly less well on the Sally-Anne task, demonstrates that \ngood complement knowledge is not always sufficient to enable successful Sally-Anne \ntask performance amongst individuals with ASD.  Further research will be required to \nestablish the reasons for the inconsistent pattern of results observed within the present \nstudy, with respect to the two false belief tasks, and to fully elucidate the relationship \nLind & Bowler (2009). Language and theory of mind in autism spectrum disorder     \n21\nbetween language and ToM amongst individuals with ASD.  Clearly, there is much \nleft to be explained.  \nTo summarise, the results of this study, although not conclusive, are at least \npartially compatible with the hypothesis that children with ASD are more reliant than \nchildren without ASD on their linguistic knowledge of complement structures to \nsucceed on false belief tasks.  This is the first study to suggest that complement syntax \nmay play a special role in the false belief task performance of children with ASD on \nat least one type of false belief task.  If this interpretation is correct, it follows that \nsuccessful false belief task performance amongst children with ASD may not \ninvariably reflect a genuine representational ToM, but rather the operation of \ncompensatory linguistic strategies.  As suggested above, some children with ASD \nmay be able to use complement syntax to represent false beliefs in certain structured \ntest situations, without going on to develop a mature ToM.  Such strategies are likely \nto be poorly suited to the task of attributing mental states in complex, dynamic real-\nlife social situations.  This may explain why even those individuals with ASD who \nreliably pass false belief tasks nevertheless demonstrate markedly diminished \nawareness mental states in their everyday lives. \nLind & Bowler (2009).
