The paper surveys the development of the concept of academic \nfreedom within Europe, more especially the impact of the reforms at the University of Berlin instigated by \nWilhelm von Humboldt. Following from this, the paper examines the reasons why the various facets of \nacademic freedom are important and why the principle should continue to be supported. \nKeywords: academic freedom; European Union; von Humboldt. \nIntroduction and Rationale \nThis paper\u2019s purpose is to critically examine the justification for, and benefits of, academic freedom \nto academic staff, university students, and society in general. The paper\u2019s rationale is as follows. \nFirstly, to increase awareness of academic freedom, among the academic community and society at \nlarge. Hamilton (1996, 550) asks: \u2018Why is there so little collegial public defense of freedom of \nacademic thought?\u2019 The answer may lie in the fact that \u2018[w]hile academics pay lip service to \nacademic freedom, all too few have given the concept much thought. Many of us have a muddled \nand inchoate idea of what it means\u2019 (Hillier 1989, 117), such that \u2018academic freedom continues to \nbe a commonly used but misunderstood concept. \u2026 only a minority of academics bother to explain \nwhat the concept of academic freedom means to them or even know what the concept really is\u2019 \n(Moens 1991, 58). However, Weidner (2001, 265) rightly states that \u2018[a] part of the academic \nfreedom we owe to new faculty is clarity and honesty about the parameters within which it \noperates\u2019. Hence, Rabban exhorts that \u2018the academy should confront more closely its own \nunderstanding of this vital concept\u2019 (Rabban 1987, 1429f) because by raising awareness of \nacademic freedom, those within the academy will be better able and motivated to defend it. Thus \n\u2018[w]e need a strong, self confident, independent faculty to protect the core concept of academic \nfreedom\u2019 (Haddon 1987, 1562), because, as Dodds points out, \u2018[t]he academic fraternity has not \nbeen too successful in explaining to laymen what this unique thing, academic freedom, is and why it \nis indispensable\u2019 (Dodds 1963, 603), in fact McGuinness believes that \u2018university lecturers and \nresearchers . . . have generally done a bad job of explaining to the public why it is in the public \ninterest to protect it\u2019 (McGuinness 2002, 1). This deficiency is part of a general failing identified by \nMetzger, (1987, 1290) who observes that \u2018a discomforting perception of the weak theoretical \nunderpinnings of this concept seems to go with an inclination to write about it at all\u2019. \nAdditionally, previous studies of academic freedom have been subject to criticism. For \nexample, Barnett argues that \u2018[t]he traditional discussions of academic freedom, whatever their \nsuperficial differences, are also depressingly uniform. They frequently exhibit the following \ncharacteristics: a lack of specificity; a concern for the academic freedom of staff not students; a \n p.2 \ndefensive proclamation of the rights of academics; and a disinclination to say anything about the \nduties that should accompany academics' rights\u2019 (Barnett 1990, 137). Similarly Gerber observes \nthat \u2018[t]oo often, \u2026 references to academic freedom in public discourse are formulaic or \ndisingenuous and fail to take in to account the full meaning of the concept\u2019 (Gerber 2001, 23). For \nexample, Moody's (1996) justification of the different claims of academic freedom, undertaken a \ndecade ago, provides a useful discussion of the consequentialist and intrinsic justifications for \nscholarly freedom, but ignores Lernfreiheit (the freedom of students to study where they chose), \nwhich many commentators regard as a central pillar of the concept. More trenchantly, Standler \nstates that \u2018[t]here is a large literature on academic freedom, mostly written by professors, and \nmostly consisting of self-serving praise and unsupported assertions\u2019 (Standler, 2000). Hence a \nsecond rationale is to address the shortcomings of previous analyses, by providing specific concrete \nevidence of the value of the elements of academic freedom, to academics, to students, universities \nand the world at large. \nThe theoretical and functional foundations of the concept originated within the nations of \nEurope, which was the cradle of the modern idea of academic freedom within a research university. \nAcademic freedom, conceived of as a particular liberty given uniquely to university scholars, arose \nfrom, and contributed to, the development of the university in Europe during the 11th and 12th \nCenturies. It remains an important defining characteristic of the workings of Universities in the \nEuropean Union. For example, the Magna Charta Universitatum (EUA 1988, 1) instituted by the \nEuropean Universities Association, states that: \u2018Freedom in research and training is the fundamental \nprinciple of university life, and governments and universities, each as far as in them lies, must \nensure respect for this fundamental requirement\u2019. Similarly the European Union Revision Treaty \nstates in Article II-73 that \u2018[t]he arts and scientific research shall be free of constraint. Academic \nfreedom shall be respected\u2019 (E.U. 2007, 12). Like the EU Constitution which it replaced, the new \nTreaty protects rights, yet imposes burdens, and is unlikely to receive electoral ratification unless \nvoters across the EU states believe that the benefits of its constituent elements outweigh the costs. \nSociety at large will only sanction the granting of a particular freedom (like academic freedom), to a \nspecific group comprising academic scholars and their students, and to which all others are denied, \nif it is persuaded that these freedoms produce net benefits. Hence a third rationale is to present a \ncoherent argument to the general public as to why it should continue to support protection for \nacademic freedom in national legislation and supra-national treaties. \nAcademic freedom is part of a wider set of complementary human rights, with an evident link \nbetween academic freedom and freedom of speech \u2013 as Connolly (2000, 71) observes \u2018academic \nfreedom is a kind of cousin of freedom of speech\u2019. Indeed Preece illustrates the close links between \nthe two. First, as all academic activity in the pursuit of knowledge involves dissemination and \n p.3 \npublic debate \u2018restriction of freedom of speech automatically involves a restriction of academic \nfreedom, except where academics are given some special freedom of speech, not available to \nmembers of society in general\u2019. Conversely, as academics are involved in the process of public \ndebate \u2018any restriction of academic freedom necessarily involves a major direct impact upon \nfreedom of debate\u2019. Additionally, as academics create new knowledge by challenging orthodoxy \nand the status quo, \u2018they are particularly vulnerable to any lack of freedom of speech in a society, \nbecause existing entrenched interests will \u2026 resist the challenge posed by new ideas\u2019. Finally, \n\u2018[w]hen a society is in the process of becoming more authoritarian, both academic freedom and \nfreedom of speech will come under attack because of the linkages\u2019 (Preece 1991, 32f). \nConsequently, academic freedom is recognised by international bodies like UNESCO as a \ntouchstone and guarantor of other fundamental human rights, such as freedom of speech. In the past \nstruggles for freedom of speech, university academics were often prominent, not least because their \nspecialist knowledge enabled them to mount valid attacks on dictatorial governments, monarchies \nand the church. For example, in 1633 the Pope imprisoned Galileo for expressing the belief that the \nearth moved around the sun. Such persecution of academics continues - in 2000 a Sociology \nProfessor in Egypt was unlawfully imprisoned for helping to make a documentary film about \nelection irregularities. Hence, in addition to being important to universities and their academics, \nacademic freedom is an indicative facet of freedom within wider society, such that where academic \nfreedom is limited, other freedoms, like freedom of speech and expression, are likely to be in \njeopardy. Thus by preserving academic freedom, other fundamental freedoms are also made safe. \nAs Polanyi (1947, 3) noted: \u2018The analysis of the grounds on which freedom rests is of great \npractical interest to those who love freedom. For by clarifying these grounds we hope to make them \nmore secure\u2019. Hence the final rationale is that strong arguments for academic freedom are also \nstrong arguments for the preservation of other basic human rights. \nThe Development of Academic Freedom \nThe lineage of academic freedom is as long and complex as those of the universities which have \ninvoked it. Thorens notes that \u2018[t]he historical origin of university autonomy and academic freedom \ngoes back to the High Middle Ages in Europe\u2019 (Thorens 2006, 92), while according to Metzger \n(1973, 94), it ca be traced back to 1158, when the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa \nissued the Authentica Habita edict protecting scholars. As Lenhardt (2002, 277) notes \u2018[a]cademic \nfreedom had started in the medieval university as a feudal privilege of the professors to \nauthoritatively teach and interpret the scholastic doctrines\u2019. Subsequently, as Neave (1988) relates, \ntwo basic prototypes emerged, in Bologna and Paris. In Bologna, autonomy was vested in the \nstudent universitas: professors were hired by the students, who also elected the Rector. In the \n p.4 \nexamination of candidates for degrees, the authority of the masters was paramount, but in all other \nmatters the students reigned supreme. By contrast, in Paris autonomy was considered in terms of the \nfreedom to teach and applied to the professors rather than the students.  \nBoth these institutions were subjected to external attempts at control, and responded similarly \nby migrating to other towns - Vincenza, Arezzo, Padua and Sienna in the case of Bologna and, as \nS\u00failleabh\u00e1in relates, \u2018in 1217 they basically held the town of Bologna to ransom by withdrawing \nfrom the town for three years until such time as their various demands for greater control over the \nstudium and the life of the town itself were met\u2019 (S\u00failleabh\u00e1in 2004, 18). Similarly, as Traver \nreports, actions like the Great Dispersion of 1229, which caused a migration of staff and students \nfrom Paris to Angers, Orleans and Oxford, lead to scholarly liberty being \u2018acknowledged as a \nuniversity right \u2026 in 1231, in Pope Gregory IX\u2019s famous bull, the so-called magna carta of the \nUniversity of Paris, Parens Scientiarum\u2019 (Traver 1997, 16). In turn, following feuds between gown, \ntown, and crown, the Paris model reached Cambridge and eventually the United States, with the \ncreation of colleges such as Harvard, Yale, Princeton and others. \nStewart (1991, 1) has documented \u2018the first clear articulation of issues of academic freedom in \nthe English-speaking world\u2019 when disaffected staff of Glasgow University tried to break the \nPrincipal\u2019s hold on university affairs by getting the student body to elect a rival candidate for Rector \nin 1716-17. However, as Goldstein rightly points out, \u2018the modern development of the doctrine of \nacademic freedom is largely derived from the nineteenth century German concepts of Lehrfreiheit \nand Lernfreiheit\u2019 (Goldstein 1976, 1293) which are associated with the reforms instituted at the \nUniversity of Berlin by Wilhelm von Humboldt. The analysis by Paletschek (2001) challenges the \ncentrality of Humboldt\u2019s contribution which, she argues, is at variance with historical fact. For \nexample the 1809-10 memorandum in which Humboldt\u2019s university plan is detailed (\u00dcber die \ninnere und \u00e4ussere Organisation der h\u00f6heren wissenschaftlichen Anstalten in Berlin), was not \npublished until the turn of the century, following its discovery by the historian Bruno Gebhardt, \nwhile researching a biography of Humboldt, after which it was discussed widely in Berlin \nUniversity during the years preceding the university\u2019s centennial celebrations in 1910. Similarly, \nNybom (2003, 144) agrees that the \u2018[t]he intellectual core and institutional rationale of the \nHumboldtian university concept rested on \u2026 ideological building blocks which were \u2026integral \ndimensions of German idealistic philosophy, and, consequently, not Wilhelm von Humboldt\u2019s own \noriginal intellectual inventions\u2019. The 100th anniversary celebrations of the founding of Berlin \nUniversity in 1910 played a crucial role in the formation of the so-called \u2018Humboldtian idea of a \nuniversity\u2019, as well as \u2018the Humboldt model\u2019.  Consequently, Miyasaka (2005, 7) opines that \u2018\u201cthe \ntraditional creation of Berlin University\u201d was consciously carried out at that time\u2019.  \n p.5 \nHence, it was not until the 20th century that the \u2018Humboldtian idea of a university\u2019 became \nwidely known and adopted, in Germany and elsewhere in Europe. Moreover, as Anderson (2000, \n12) has noted, \u2018what happened at the end of the nineteenth century was not so much the triumph of \nthe Humboldtian ideal as a new synthesis in which elements of both Enlightenment and \nHumboldtian traditions were merged\u2019. However, it is difficult to demur with Howard\u2019s observation \nthat \u2018[g]ranting the complex antecedents behind all historical beginnings, few would nevertheless \ngainsay that it was most notably in post-revolutionary Prussia, beginning with the dramatic \nfounding of the University of Berlin in 1810, that the modern university first appeared on the \nhistorical stage\u2019 (Howard 2006, 4). Similarly, Jones argues that \u2018this was the idea of the university \nwhich, more than any other, transformed the functioning of learning and higher education in \nnineteenth-century Europe\u2019 (Jones 2007, 5). This new idea of the university quickly extended its \ninfluence beyond Europe to the USA. For example, the theologian Philip Schaff, a Privatdozent in \nthe University of Berlin in 1842 and later a Professor in New York, remarked that \u2018[t]he university \nof Berlin, although one of the youngest, occupies the first rank of all similar institutions in Germany \nnot only, but in the world\u2019(Schaff 1857, 63). Abraham Flexner, the American educator and co-\nfounder of Princeton\u2019s Institute for Advanced Study, was similarly convinced of the excellence of \nGerman universities following Humboldt\u2019s research and reported that \u2018Humboldt conceived the \nsalvation of the German nation as coming from the combination of teaching and research, and time \nhas proved him right\u2019, leading Flexner to opine that \u2018a university in this sense we did not possess \nuntil the Johns Hopkins University modestly opened its portals in 1876\u2019 (Flexner 1930, 312, 42). \nThe pre-eminence of Humboldt's model in the USA has lead Bruch (1997, 27) to conclude that \u2018the \nidea of the modern university according to the conceptions of Schleiermacher and Humboldt may \ntoday be better preserved in the North American than in the German system of higher education\u2019. \nWithin German universities built on Humboldtian principles \u2018academic freedom embraced \nthree interrelated principles: Lehrfreiheit, Lernfreiheit and Freiheit der Wissenschaft\u2019 (Metzger \n1987, 1269). As Hofstadter and Metzger relate: \u2018By Lehrfreiheit, the German educator meant two \nthings. He meant that the university professor was free to examine bodies of evidence and to report \nhis findings in lecture or published form -- that he enjoyed freedom of teaching and freedom of \ninquiry. . . .  This freedom was not, as the Germans conceived it, an inalienable endowment of all \nmen, ... rather, it was the distinctive prerogative of the academic profession, and the essential \ncondition of all universities. In addition, Lehrfreiheit ... also denoted the paucity of administrative \nrules within the teaching situation: the absence of a prescribed syllabus, the freedom from tutorial \nduties, the opportunity to lecture on any subject according to the teacher's interest. Thus, academic \nfreedom, ... was not simply the right of professors to speak without fear or favor, but the atmosphere \nof consent that surrounded the whole process of research and instruction\u2019 (Hofstadter and Metzger \n p.6 \n1955, 386f). Hence Lehrfreiheit referred to \u2018the statutory right of full and associate professors, who \nwere salaried civil servants, to discharge their professional duties outside the chain of command that \nencompassed other government officials. It allowed them to decide on the content of their lectures \nand to publish the findings of their research without seeking prior ministerial or ecclesiastical \napproval or fearing state or church reproof\u2019 (Metzger 1987, 1269). Hence, focusing on the rights of \nthe academic staff, this aspect of the Humboldtian model of academic freedom had precedents in \nthe University of Paris model. \nThe second aspect, of Lernfreiheit, refers to \u2018learning freedom\u2019 but as Metzger relates, within \nthe national context of Germany at that time, this right amounted to \u2018a disclaimer by the university \nof any control over the students' course of study save that which they needed to prepare them for \nstate professional examinations or to qualify them for an academic teaching license. It also absolved \nthe university of any responsibility for students' private conduct, ... (hence) \u2026 the German \nuniversity confronted its student body primarily as a purveyor of knowledge and as a credentializing \nagency, not as a parent surrogate or landlord. For their part, German students, obliged to find their \nown lodgings and diversions, liberated from course grades and classroom roll calls, free to move \nfrom place to place sampling academic wares, presented themselves to the university as mature and \nself-reliant beings, not as neophytes, tenants or wards\u2019 (Metzger 1987, 1270). Hence, this aspect of \nthe Humboldtian model of academic freedom, with its emphasis on the rights of students, had \nprecedents in the University of Bologna model. \nThe final aspect of academic freedom was the right of academic self-governance and \ninstitutional autonomy. Hence \u2018with substantial state control over appointments, universities were \nentitled to make their own decisions on internal matters under the direction of the senior faculty. \nThe concept of academic self-governance that undergirds Freiheit der Wissenschaft is recognizable \nas a forerunner of the emphasis on institutional autonomy that developed in the courts\u2019 discussions \nof academic freedom\u2019 (Horwitz 2005, 475). This right was deemed necessary to protect the \nfreedoms of teaching and research. Without such protection, \u2018the university, it was thought, would \nbe dangerously vulnerable to government or religious censorship. Without broad institutional \npowers, the academic Gelehrten (staff), it was feared, would be at the mercy of the state or church. \n\u2026 (hence) institutional autonomy was indispensable to academic freedom\u2019 (Metzger 1987, 1270f). \nThe unity of teaching and research, (Einheit von Lehre und Forschung) and the collaborative \npursuit of these by staff and students was a central aspect of the Humboldtian model. Thus \nHumboldt considered that universities have \u2018as their task the cultivation of science and scholarship \nin the deepest and broadest sense,\u2019 in which \u2018[c]ollaboration operates through a process in which the \nsuccessful intellectual achievements of one person arouse the intellectual passions and enthusiasms \n p.7 \nof others, and through the fact that what was at first expressed only by one individual becomes a \ncommon intellectual possession instead of fading away in isolation\u2019. In this process \u2018both teacher \nand student have their justification in the common pursuit of knowledge\u2019 and hence \u2018the goals of \nscience and scholarship are worked towards most effectively through the synthesis of the teacher's \nand the students' dispositions\u2019 (Humboldt 1970, 242f). Hence as Lay observes \u2018[t]eaching was to be \na means of improving both lecturer and student: true knowledge would emerge in the interplay \nbetween experience and enthusiasm\u2019 (Lay 2004, 48). \nIn sum, the Humboldtian model of academic freedom emphasised the unity between teaching \nand research, and the consequent need for academic freedom to be enjoyed by both students and \nuniversity teachers, with the latter possessing professional status as tenured civil servants, allied to \ninstitutional autonomy from the state and internal self-governance. Variants of this model are still \ndiscernable within European Universities and beyond, and will be familiar to academic staff, who \nneed no convincing of the centrality of the concept to their everyday working lives. However, if \nsuch a model is to be adopted within the E.U. Revision Treaty, and moreover to protect its \ncontinued existence in individual EU states, it is necessary to convince those outside of academia of \nthe importance of academic freedom: to academics, students, universities as institutions and society \nat large. \nWhy is Academic Freedom Important? \nFirst, academic freedom is clearly important to individual academics. As Shils points out: \u2018The \njustification of academic freedom is that it protects the moral and intellectual integrity of the \nteacher\u2019 (Shils 1995, 7). In respect to their teaching, Machlup notes that the situation of academics \nis unusual as \u2018[t]he occupational work of the vast majority of people is largely independent of their \nthought and speech\u2019, while by contrast \u2018[t]he professor's work consists of his thought and speech. If \nhe loses his position for what he writes or says, he will, as a rule, have to leave his profession, and \nmay no longer be able effectively to question and challenge accepted doctrines or effectively to \ndefend challenged doctrines\u2019 (Machlup 1955, 756). Therefore, as De George states, academic \nfreedom for teaching \u2018is the right to teach one's discipline in the way that one, because of his or her \nknowledge, deems best. If it is for one's knowledge that a university hires a teacher, it must presume \nthat the teacher is the best qualified person it can find to teach the subject\u2019 (De George 2003, 17). In \nthis respect Dworkin argues that \u2018academic freedom insulates scholars from the administrators of \ntheir universities \u2026 (who) \u2026 cannot dictate how those who have been appointed will teach what \nhas been decided will be taught\u2019 (Dworkin 1996, 183), consequently, \u2018academic freedom is \ndesigned to protect individual scholars, even against the institutions where they serve\u2019 (Daughtrey \n1990, 270). This protection extends beyond the powers of administrators \u2013 as Menand makes clear: \n p.8 \n\u2018Academic freedom not only protects sociology professors from the interference of trustees and \npublic officials in the exercise of their jobs as teachers and scholars; it protects them from physics \nprofessors as well\u2019 (Menand 1996, 17). \nThe importance of this right of academic freedom for university teaching was recognized in the \nUSA by the Supreme Court. In 1957, in the case of Sweezy v. New Hampshire, when a university \nlecturer was held in contempt for refusing to reveal the subject of his lectures, the Court overturned \nthe decision and argued that: \u2018The essentiality of freedom in the community of American \nuniversities is almost self-evident. \u2026 Scholarship cannot flourish in an atmosphere of suspicion and \ndistrust. Teachers and students must always remain free to inquire, to study and to evaluate, to gain \nnew maturity and understanding; otherwise our civilization will stagnate and die. \u2026 History has \namply proved the virtue of political activity by minority, dissident groups, who innumerable times \nhave been in the vanguard of democratic thought and whose programs were ultimately accepted. \nMere unorthodoxy or dissent from the prevailing mores is not to be condemned. The absence of \nsuch voices would be a symptom of grave illness in our society\u2019 (Sweezy v. New Hampshire 1957, \n250). \nSuch pronouncements endorse Turner\u2019s belief that: \u2018Academic freedom is ... to the academic \nprofession what judicial independence is to judges, freedom of conscience to the clergy, the \nprotection of sources of information to the journalist, parliamentary privilege to the MP, the \nexercise of clinical judgement to the doctor, the right of hot pursuit to the policeman\u2019 (Turner 1988, \n107). Similarly, White sees the concept in its broadest perspective as \u2018not simply the right of \nprofessors to speak without fear or favor, but the atmosphere of consent that surrounded the whole \nprocess of research and instruction\u2019 (White 2000, 58). However, as Shils states, limitations do exist \n- \u2018[an academic] is not free to teach propositions that are contrary to the prevailing tradition unless \nhe can support his contentions with evidence from his own research\u2019 (Shils 1991, 4). Additionally, \nFinkin cautions that academic freedom in teaching carries a reciprocal duty: \u2018Long professional \ntraining, the mastery of the subject matter, and the passage of a period of apprenticeship undergird \nthe assertion of a professional prerogative, in return for which \u2026 the academic is rightly held to a \nprofessional standard of care\u2019 (Finkin 1987, 1332). \nJust as academic freedom is important in protecting the teaching of individual academics, so it \nis with research. As Thompson relates \u2018progress toward deeper understanding and new discoveries, \nin any field, requires a willingness to adopt new perspectives and new approaches. Reaction against \nchange can and does come from any quarter: the state, the church, the business sector, society at \nlarge, one's own colleagues\u2019 (Thompson 1996, 3). Moreover the protection of academic freedom \nhas become especially important following the growth of external commercially funded research \u2013 \n p.9 \n\u2018secrecy of research results, distortion of the viewpoints and claims of academic researchers, and \ndistortion of the research agenda\u2019 are, Eisenberg (1987, 1378) suggests, \u2018by no means exhaustive of \nthe ways sponsored research might compromise the integrity of the academic enterprise\u2019. This \nproblem is exacerbated when research productivity is an institutional requirement for promotion or \nsalary enhancement, as Coelho states \u2018[i]n a publish or perish oriented college or university, \npromotions, tenure, and salary increases are awarded on the basis of an individual's contributions to \nscholarly journals and his publications of monographs and texts. The more a professor publishes, \nthe more likely he is to be promoted, granted tenure, and given salary increases . . . (and) . . . \nAcademics tend to equate research with productivity\u2019 (Coelho 1976, 423). Assessing such claims, \nYudof injects some realism into the research justification for academic freedom, by pointing out \nthat studies in the USA reveal that \u2018[o]ne- third of all professors admit to spending no time at all on \nresearch, while more than half spend less than five hours a week on it. \u2026 60 % of a sample of 5000 \nprofessors had never published or even edited a book in their subject areas\u2019 (Yudof 1987, 842). \nShils is similarly critical and argues that \u2018[i]t is frequently said that originality of discovery and \nanalysis is inhibited or suppressed where there is no right of academic freedom, \u2026 I think that this \nis not straightforward. Most cases of infringement of academic freedom have nothing to do with \noriginal thought or discovery. Most academics are not capable of original thought or discovery\u2019 \n(Shils 1995, 7). \nHowever, it is true nevertheless that without the benefit of academic freedom for research, \nmajor scientific discoveries, which have irrevocably ameliorated society, would not have been \nmade. Conrad Russell relates the struggles his famous father had in the two years it took him to \nproduce the Principia Mathematica, noting that \u2018those two years, however much they might appear \ntotally unproductive, were a very valuable investment of academic time. We are now told that the \ndevelopment of the digital computer would have been impossible without the research\u2019. Despite his \nacademic pre-eminence Bertrand Russell was twice removed from his academic post, firstly for his \nopposition to the First World War, and secondly, his views on marriage, leading his son to remark: \n\u2018If this fate can happen twice, to a scholar of this standing, it can happen to lesser men and women \nalso, and the fear of it can inhibit research\u2019 (Russell 1993, 24). During the Second World War \nacademic research was responsible for developing the Atomic Bomb, under a team lead by Robert \nOppenheimer, while in the UK the mathematician Alan Turing and his colleagues at Bletchley Park \ndevised techniques to break German military cyphers - the work of both these groups (and others) \nare considered to have been crucial to the war effort. Similarly, in the post-war period, James \nWatson (1968), in his account of the discovery of the structure of DNA, chronicles how he and \nFrancis Crick (at that time studying for a PhD in different subject area) were told by Sir Lawrence \nBragg (himself a Nobel Laureate) to discontinue their study of DNA. Luckily they continued with \n p.10 \nthe work discretely which lead to the discovery of the double helix structure and the award of the \nNobel Prize in 1962.  Hence even eminent scientists, holders of Nobel prizes and knighthoods, can \nbe mistaken about what research should be pursued, but provided academic freedom exists, \nuniversity researchers can safely undertake research into areas which their superiors may, \nerroneously, deem unproductive.  James Watson continues to champion academic freedom, in 1990 \nhe stated: \u2018The nations of the world must see that the human genome belongs to the world's people, \nas opposed to its nations\u2019 (Watson 1990, 48) and consequently resigned as Head of the Human \nGenome Project, in opposition to the move to acquire patents on gene sequences and any ownership \nof the \u2018laws of nature\u2019. Such examples clearly validate Horwitz\u2019s claim that \u2018[a]cademic freedom is \nprized primarily because its contribution to truth-seeking will yield discoveries or insights that \nultimately will benefit society at large\u2019 (Horwitz 2005, 484).  \nDespite such case studies and Hamilton\u2019s belief that \u2018[m]any academics are extremely \nindependent with a focus on intellectual creativity. They value a secure and stable environment \nwhere they can do their work alone\u2019 (Hamilton 1996, 558), little empirical work has been \nundertaken on the impact of academic freedom on research. However, Bennich-Bjorkman\u2019s \nanalysis, based on interviews of academic staff in Sweden, discovered that \u2018[t]he norm of academic \nfreedom lives on and is significant in the research community even though there are variations in \nwhere the emphasis is placed\u2019 (Bennich-Bjorkman 2004, 23). More significantly, this study pointed \nto the important distinction made by Berlin (1969) between negative freedom (the absence of \nconstraint - \u2018not being prevented from choosing as I do\u2019) and positive freedom (the freedom and \nability to act and be \u2018one\u2019s own master\u2019). Bennich-Bjorkman found that most of the researchers \ninterviewed had the latter but not the former. Hence researchers were unconstrained in the choices \nthey made for the subject of their research, but were unable to undertake their research through lack \nof resources. Given the increasing costs of high level research, more especially in the natural \nsciences like atomic physics, it seems likely that academic freedom for research is moving from \npositive to negative freedom. For example, in 1671, while Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at \nCambridge University, Isaac Newton stated: \u2018I procured me a triangular glass prism to try therewith \nthe celebrated phenomena of colours\u2019 (Newton 1671, 3075). His modern day counterpart, \nundertaking research into particle cosmology, would require a particle accelerator and collider. As \nStandler rightly points out: \u2018What universities and professors really need is not meaningless words \nabout the importance of \u201cacademic freedom\u201d from judges, but adequate financial support for \nprofessors' salaries, and adequate financial support for scientific equipment and research expenses, \nlibraries, buildings, etc. Academic freedom means nothing if professors can not afford to do the \nresearch that they are supposedly free to do\u2019 (Standler, 2000). Similarly, Thomson (1975, 257) \nargues that \u2018it is irrational for a community to support an institution of higher education \u2026 whose \n p.11 \npurposes are the increase and dissemination of knowledge, and at the same time to make it more \ndifficult or impossible for those employed by that institution to increase and disseminate \nknowledge\u2019. \nEvidence exists of the effect that academic freedom has on the performance of academic staff, \nvia differing governance patterns, but it is equivocal. For example, cross sectional empirical work \nby McCormick and Meiners found that \u2018autocratically managed universities are more productive \nthan democratically run institutions in terms of publication in journals and the teaching of students\u2019 \nand that \u2018the results here support the conclusion that faculty successful at research and teaching do \nnot participate much in the actual management of their university, and those who do administer do \nnot publish as much or teach as well\u2019 (McCormick and Meiners 1988, 429, 441). Less conclusively, \nBrown\u2019s study found that: \u2018Greater faculty control over appointment, promotion and tenure \ndecisions and faculty governance decisions is associated with increased performance\u2019, while \n\u2018[g]reater faculty participation in general administration decisions and financial decisions is \nnegatively related to performance,\u2019 leading him to conclude that \u2018[t]he observed empirical \nrelationships are not inconsistent with the hypothesis that faculty participation in governance \ninfluences performance\u2019. However, he found that the \u2018overall impact of this participation varies by \nthe types of decisions in which faculty participate\u2019, and acknowledged \u2018the need for better and more \ncomprehensive measures of both university performance and governance\u2019 (W. Brown 2001, 130). \nBy contrast Gadd\u2019s statistical analysis of the impact of higher education reforms in Sweden, \nutilising routine bureaucracy, professional expert and collegiate organisational models, found that \n\u2018if the extent of self governance in higher education increases, the productivity of higher education \nalso changes in a positive direction\u2019 (Gadd 2005, 210). Exemplar case studies provide endorsement \nfor this cross-sectional evidence. For example Max Perutz, Nobel Laureate and founding Director \nof Cambridge University\u2019s Molecular Biology Laboratory, believed that \u2018creativity in science, as in \nthe arts, cannot be organised. It arises spontaneously from individual talent. Well-run laboratories \ncan foster it, but hierarchical organisation, inflexible, bureaucratic rules, and mountains of futile \npaperwork can kill it. Discoveries cannot be planned; they pop up, like Puck, in unexpected corners\u2019 \n(Perutz 2003, ix). Perutz\u2019s inspired stewardship, through adherence to these guiding principles, \nenabled MBL\u2019s staff to produce research of the highest quality, subsequently recognised through \nthe award of twelve Nobel prizes since 1962. Similarly, writing in the Oxford Magazine in 1997, \nthe Warden of Nuffield College, Nevil Johnson, counselled his colleagues that \u2018[a] university \nmanaged like an industrial enterprise is an impossibility: it would just no longer be a university. \u2026 \nWe cannot \u201cmanage\u201d people into successful teaching, nor can we ensure by good management that \npeople do high quality research or write original books\u2019 (Johnson 1997, 4). \n p.12 \nAdopting a case study approach to involvement by academic staff in governance within four \ninstitutions, Hamilton concluded that \u2018academic tradition ties the shared governance tradition \ndirectly to peer review, academic freedom and the mission of the university to create knowledge \nand teach critical inquiry\u2019 (Hamilton 2004, 98). Similarly, Shattock\u2019s review of U.K. institutional \ncase studies (including Cambridge) led him to conclude that \u2018[t]here are some universities, probably \nmostly the most academically successful, which have developed a strong organizational culture that \neffectively marries academic and managerial structures to provide both effective decision-making \nmachinery and a strongly self motivated academic community. Such a structure is likely to be able \nto resist the worst aspects of \u2026 managerialism and to be able to preserve a robust academic ethos\u2019 \n(Shattock 1999, 281). Furthermore he found \u2018little hard evidence that the new managerialism \u2026 has \nbeen particularly successful in delivering academic success\u2019 and that \u2018where improprieties and \nbreakdowns have occurred, they have centred on governing bodies and the executive and not on the \nacademic community. Indeed, in nearly all such cases \u2026 attention was drawn to the difficulties by \nconcern in the academic community\u2019 (Shattock 2002, 240). This conclusion is endorsed by Brown\u2019s \nsurvey of governance in U.K. universities which found that \u2018[i]f there is one common feature \nrunning through these reports it is the difficulty which these institutions had in controlling the \nbehaviour of a strong chief executive who was often closely associated with a small group of key \nGovernors who may have bypassed a largely supine Governing Body, many of whom were not \nsufficiently knowledgeable either about higher education matters or about their own rights and \nresponsibilities as members of the supreme decision making body of a higher education institution\u2019 \n(R. Brown 2001, 44). In sum, these findings demonstrate that when the intellectual curiosity \ninherent in academic freedom is sacrificed for the institutional conformity required by \nadministrative functionaries, academic mediocrity, rather than merit, is the more likely outcome. \nThere is no discernable data on the impact of participation in the appointment of the Rector (or \nthe equivalent chief managerial officer within the university \u2013 Vice Chancellor, University \nPresident, etc.) on academic freedom. However, where the Rector is an external appointment for an \nindefinite term by an external agency, s\/he will be in a position to abuse academic freedom, more \nespecially where the staff lack the protection of tenure. By contrast, a Rector chosen internally by \nthe academic staff, for a limited period, is unlikely to undermine the staff\u2019s academic freedom, as \nsuch actions will lead to retaliatory actions and removal from office. Moreover, an internal nominee \nwho knows well the strengths, weaknesses and internal organisation of the institution, can act \ndecisively, knowing s\/he already possesses the support and trust of the university staff. Giving the \npowers of appointment to the staff, and thereby making them responsible for their decisions, \nenables them to make informed and inspired choices, secure in the knowledge that their \nappointment, if ill-chosen, can be easily removed from office and safely returned to work in his\/her \n p.13 \nDepartment. By contrast, an appointment board dominated by nominees from outside higher \neducation and less well-informed about the needs of university than are the academic staff, is more \nlikely to make ill-informed and inappropriate appointments, or to be more risk averse and therefore \nunlikely to make innovative appointments. Significantly, a cross sectional analysis by Goodall of \nthe top 100 universities, as identified by Shanghai Jiao Tong University\u2019s Institute of Higher \nEducation, examined the research credentials (articles and citations in top ranked journals, Nobel \nprizes, etc.) of their executive leaders (Vice-Chancellors, Rectors, etc.). The study revealed that \n\u2018[t]he most highly ranked universities have leaders who are more highly cited\u2019, and that \n\u2018[i]nternationally active researchers lead the world\u2019s top universities. On average the higher the \nuniversity is in the global ranking, the more highly cited is that institution\u2019s president\u2019 (Goodall \n2006, 397, 402). Presidents who are pre-eminent in their research fields are more likely to \nunderstand the need to protect academic freedom in the institutions that they lead, than are their \ncounterparts who are drawn from outside of academia, or who have been appointed on the basis of \nnon-research expertise. Such findings provide empirical reinforcement for the view that academic \nfreedom has a positive impact on research productivity and university excellence. \nAs well as being crucial to academic staff in the successful fulfilment of their professional \nroles, academic freedom for students has been, and remains, important. In the 12th century, as Lay \nrelates, students at Bologna demanded \u2018the right to appoint their own lecturers, and to direct the \ncurriculum they would be taught\u2019 (Lay 2004, 32), and within the later Humboldtian university \nmodel \u2018to the university student, Lernfreiheit, was a precious privilege, a recognition of his arrival \nat man\u2019s estate\u2019 (Hofstadter and Metzger 1955, 387). Hence, as Barnett observes, under the idealist \nepistemology adopted by Humboldt and the founders of the modern German university \u2018knowledge \n. . . was to be gained through entering a critical dialogue with others. Consequently, there was no \ndifference in kind in the formal position of teachers and taught. Both were engaged in the same kind \nof activity, in exploring accounts of the world through participation in a conversation. \u2026 (thus) \u2026 \nit was entirely apposite for the notion of student freedom to arise\u2019 (Barnett 1990, 138). Interestingly, \nMoens notes that under this concept \u2018[s]tudents were free to move from one place to another to \nsample academic offerings \u2026 (and) \u2026 this understanding of a student's right to academic freedom \nenjoys a revival in the European Community where students are encouraged to seek part of their \neducation in a Member State of which they are not nationals\u2019 (Moens 1991, 59). However, as Tight \npoints out \u2018[i]t is not sufficient to rely solely on the historical notion of Lernfreiheit in considering \nwhat elements of academic freedom students may have a need for or an entitlement to\u2019 (Tight 1988, \n121), supporting Magsino\u2019s view that \u2018the claim to student academic freedom has not been \npresented with either clarity, consistency or adequacy\u2019 (Magsino 1978, 48). \n p.14 \nIn partial answer to this, Derrington\u2019s judicial opinion is that in contemporary universities \n\u2018academic freedom of students consists not only of the right to dissent without penalty, but also, of \na freedom from oppression, by the lecturer's peddling of his own idiosyncratic views in a way that \nwould unduly influence their vulnerable minds; and a freedom from having a fair representation of \nopposing views withheld from them\u2019 (Derrington 1991, 92f). In the USA, the Supreme Court \nprovided legal support for this view in the Keyishian v. Board of Regents judgment in 1967 when it \ndeclared that: \u2018Our Nation is deeply committed to safeguarding academic freedom, which is of \ntranscendent value to all of us, and not merely to the teachers concerned. The classroom is \npeculiarly the \u201cmarketplace of ideas.\u201d The Nation's future depends upon leaders trained through \nwide exposure to that robust exchange of ideas which discovers truth \u201cout of a multitude of tongues, \n[rather] than through any kind of authoritative selection\u201d\u2019 (Keyishian v. Board of Regents 1967, \n603). Implicit in the notion of the classroom as a \u2018marketplace of ideas\u2019 is the Humboldtian ideal of \nscholarship as the shared common pursuit of knowledge, and thereby the necessary requirement of \nacademic freedom for staff and students alike. Hence Monypenny (1963, 633) argues that \n\u2018educational institutions . . . must be a community in which ideas can develop, be exchanged, tested, \nand discarded, in which the unorthodox is given a hearing and in which the inhibitions against the \nnew and the strange are at a minimum. Such a community cannot be a community of teachers only, \nsince the most important product of teachers is their students. Their students can have the advantage \nof the characteristic experience of the community, of free intellectual innovation and exchange, \nonly by participating in it.\u2019 \nThe claim of students to such rights was strengthened in 1995 by the Supreme Court in the case \nof Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia which made direct reference to \nthe academic freedom\u2019s genesis within the universities of Europe. Justice Kennedy, addressing the \nperceived danger to individual thought and expression, argued that \u2018[the] danger is especially real in \nthe University setting, where the State acts against a background and tradition of thought and \nexperiment that is at the center of our intellectual and philosophic tradition. . . . In ancient Athens, \nand, as Europe entered into a new period of intellectual awakening, in places like Bologna, Oxford, \nand Paris, universities began as voluntary and spontaneous assemblages or concourses for students \nto speak and to write and to learn. . . . The quality and creative power of student intellectual life to \nthis day remain a vital measure of a school\u2019s influence and attainment. For the University, by \nregulation, to cast disapproval on particular viewpoints of its students risks the suppression of free \nspeech and creative inquiry in one of the vital centers for the nation\u2019s intellectual life, its college \nand university campuses\u2019 (Rosenberger v. Rector 1995, 819). \n p.15 \nThe freedom of academic staff to protect the academic credibility and content of courses is \nimportant to students who thereby \u2018benefit from the academic freedom of the faculty and perhaps \nfrom the atmosphere of freedom which should prevail on a campus\u2019 (van den Haag 1963, 515), \nwhile \u2018[a]cademics who cherish academic freedom for themselves and deliberately, or even \nknowingly, deprive their students of it, by acting contrary to these principles, are intellectually \ndishonest\u2019 (Derrington 1991, 93). As Standler (2000) points out, if the syllabus and teaching \nmethods are less challenging at one university, than at others, then a degree from that university is \nworth less than a degree from a university with higher academic standards. If university students \nwish to remain competitive in an increasingly international job market, their best interests are \nserved by ensuring that there are uniformly high standards in university education. Confirming this, \n\u00c5kerlind and Kayrooz reported that \u2018[p]reliminary findings also suggest that constraints on \nacademic freedom may be a factor in falling teaching and student standards and an emphasis on \n\u201csafe\u201d rather than speculative or contentious research\u2019 (\u00c5kerlind and Kayrooz 2003, 327). With \nrespect to these findings that constraints on academic freedom may lead to falling teaching \nstandards, it is worth noting that the U.K. h.e. sector, in which, as Karran (2007) demonstrated, \nacademic freedom has less legal protection than other E.U. nations, found it necessary in the 1990\u2019s \nto establish a national quality assurance agency for higher education to undertake institutional and \nsubject audits to ensure that teaching quality was being maintained \nIn addition to being important to staff and students, academic freedom is a defining character of \nthe health of universities. Hence Manan declaims that \u2018[a]cademic freedom is a pre-condition for \nacademic excellence\u2019 (Manan 2000, 255), while Abdel-Motaal believes that \u2018[t]he fundamental \npurpose of Academic Freedom - and it is all too often forgotten - is to instill and to maintain those \nconditions within the university that are conducive to fostering and advancing creativity, social \ndevelopment and to sustaining the advancement of knowledge\u2019 (Abdel-Motaal 2002, 369). In a like \nvein, Altbach (2001, 205f) states that: \u2018[a]cademic Freedom is at the very core of the mission of the \nuniversity. It is essential to teaching and research. . . .for without academic freedom, universities \ncannot achieve their potential nor fully contribute to the emerging knowledge-based society\u2019. \nFurthermore, Human Rights Watch has argued that \u2018[a] university fulfils its mission when \nacademics are not forced to support an official line, an economic agenda, or a political ideology, but \nrather are free to use their talents to advance human knowledge and understanding\u2019 (Human Rights \nWatch), while Byrne states \u2018[a]cademic freedom provides both functional and aspirational norms \nfor the university. . . . Academic freedom always remains enmeshed in the changing fortunes of \nhigher education in the larger society, yet its meaning cannot be exhausted in contingency and \npragmatism. It maintains our connection with an ideal academy where disinterested scholars pursue \nliving knowledge with rigor and grace\u2019 (Byrne 1993, 317). \n p.16 \nPerhaps the strongest justifications for academic freedom as an essential pre-requisite for \ninstitutional excellence have come from past Presidents of Harvard and Yale, universities rightly \ndeemed paragons of research pre-eminence and scholarly endeavour. Kingman Brewster, President \nof Yale for over a decade (and later Master of University College, Oxford) asserted that \u2018[i]n strong \nuniversities, assuring freedom from intellectual conformity coerced within the institution is even \nmore of a concern than is the protection of freedom from external interference . . . This spirit of \nacademic freedom within the university has a value which goes beyond protecting the individual's \nbroad scope of thought and inquiry. . . . If a university is alive and productive, it is a place where \ncolleagues are in constant dispute; defending their latest intellectual enthusiasm, attacking the \ncontrary views of others. . . . It is vital that this contest be uninhibited by fear of reprisal. . . . The \nmore subtle condition of academic freedom is that faculty members, once they have proved their \npotential during a period of junior probation, should not feel beholden to anyone, especially \nDepartment Chairmen, Deans, Provosts or Presidents, for favour, let alone for survival\u2019 (Brewster \n1972, 328). Echoing this view, Derek Bok, President of Harvard for over 20 years, has written \n\u2018academic freedom is not merely a reflection of society's commitment to free speech; it is a \nsafeguard essential to the aims of the university and to the welfare of those who work within it. \nTeachers and scholars have a vital stake in continuing to enjoy the liberty to speak and write as they \nchoose, because their lives are entirely devoted to developing and expounding ideas. Universities in \nturn have a critical interest in preserving free expression, for without that freedom they will be \nhampered in appointing the most creative scientists and scholars and will suffer from forms of \ncensorship that will jeopardise the search for knowledge and new discovery that represents their \nmost distinctive contribution\u2019 (Bok 1982, 20). \nAt societal level, academic freedom is indicative of democratic values within the wider \ncommunity, as many scholars have noted. Hughes, for example, argues that \u2018[t]he rationales \nunderlying the guarantee of freedom of expression in society at large are equally applicable to the \nuniversity setting. Freedom of expression is necessary both for democratic government and the \ndetermination of what matters in the university\u2019 (Hughes 1995, 79). Consequently Rochford, finds \nthat \u2018academic freedom is not for the benefit of the academic, or even of the institution. It is for the \nbenefit of society at large, and society\u2019s failure to provide the environment in which this freedom \ncan flourish will result in the loss of a valuable asset\u2019 (Rochford 2003, 259). A similar argument is \nadvanced by Lynch, who states that \u2018where the state\u2019s goals are critical democratic education or the \npromotion of new discoveries, academic freedom is not a hindrance but rather is crucial to the \naccomplishment of the state\u2019s mission\u2019 (Lynch 2003, 1063). More strongly, Bergan considers \nacademic freedom to be \u2018the heart of democratic society . . . a democratic society is hardly \nconceivable without . . . academic freedom\u2019 (Bergan 2002, 49), a sentiment echoed by van Ginkel\u2019s \n p.17 \nbelief that \u2018[a]cademic freedom is a practical exercise in learning and advancing democracy\u2019 (van \nGinkel 2002, 351). Hence, Manan postulates, \u2018[i]n a society that has a high regard for knowledge \nand universal values, the scope of academic freedom is wide. On the other hand, in authoritarian \nand autocratic societies, the scope for academic freedom is very narrow\u2019 (Manan 2000, 257). \nSimilarly Tuner argues that \u2018academic freedom stands as one of the freedoms which a free society \nshould value, cherish and maintain. A society which erodes or abolishes it is destroying a part of its \ncivilized values, and may go on to destroy the others. It has been wisely said that the first target of \nthose who wish to set up dictatorships is freedom of speech, the freedom of academics included\u2019 \n(Turner 1988, 111). Pritchard agrees that \u2018academic freedom is but a facet of freedom in the larger \nsociety and malaise in academe is related to, and symptomatic of, that in the body politic as a \nwhole\u2019 and relates that \u2018academic freedoms are implicit rather than explicit in the United Kingdom \n\u2026 The erosion of these freedoms in academe is merely a reflection of a constitutional crisis in the \nlarger society\u2019 (Pritchard 1998, 123). \nAn allied argument is advanced by Allen (1988, 112) who suggests that \u2018one of the services \nwhich universities can render is to provide serious and direct criticism of the society of which they \nare a part\u2019. Moreover, as Burgess points out, this role is significant even in democracies, for \n\u2018[d]emocratic governments can err. Popular demand may be foolish. Both can be arbitrary, unjust \nand capricious. A democratic society is a plural society, one in which criticism is welcome and \nalternatives possible. ... Many of the greatest advances have been made against political oppression, \npopular indifference or worse\u2019 (Burgess, 1979, 145). Consequently, as Hernes contends, \u2018Professors \nhave not just served as experts and attendants for the powerful which fed them. They have \nrepresented counter-expertise. Hence politicians and the powers that be have not always seen \nprofessors as easy to handle - or believed that their knowledge produces wisdom\u2019 (Hernes 1993, \n270). Sjoberg (1998) carries this argument further by suggesting that academic freedom is also \nimportant in enabling university staff to criticise and hold private corporations to account for their \nactions. Hence academic freedom enables university staff to provide expert criticism of the \nworkings of government and the corporate sector, and ensure that they are accountable for their \nactions, thereby strengthening democracy. In this sense, as Machlup observed, \u2018academic freedom \nis a right of the people, not a privilege of a few\u2019 (Machlup 1955, 753). \nConclusion \nWriting in 1993, Edward Shils posed the question: \u2018Do We Still Need Academic Freedom?\u2019 \nDirecting his question at academia, rather than broader society, Shils concluded there was an \nacknowledgement that \u2018substantive academic freedom was now so well established that the \nacademic profession \u2026 could cease to be anxious about its protection\u2019 (Shils 1993, 209). However, \n p.18 \nfor academic freedom to flourish requires a consensus from within academia and the world at large \nthat retention of the concept is beneficial to all, and not just university staff and students. Hence, \nthis paper\u2019s purpose was to critically examine the justification for, and benefits of, academic \nfreedom, to both the academic community and society in general. Over 40 years ago the Robbins \nCommittee on Higher Education in the U.K. concluded that academic freedom \u2018is a necessary \ncondition of the highest efficiency and the proper progress of academic institutions and that \nencroachments upon their liberty, in the supposed interests of greater efficiency ,would in fact \ndiminish their efficiency and stultify their development\u2019 (Robbins 1963, 229). The arguments \nadvanced in this paper confirm this conclusion and demonstrate that academic freedom is important \nto everyone\u2019s well-being, as well as being particularly pertinent to academics and their students, in \ntheir daily activities of teaching and learning. Moreover, it is likely that the beneficial impacts of \nacademic freedom will increase rather than decrease in the future, for the following reasons. \nFirstly, society is moving towards a knowledge economy and pushing back the frontiers of \nknowledge secures economic growth and prosperity - estimates have shown that the growth in the \nvolume of knowledge is accelerating, and can now double every five years (van Ginkel 1994, 72). \nTo operate successfully within such an environment, Botkin et al. (1979) believe, requires a shift \nfrom maintenance learning (i.e. acquiring an historical body of knowledge required to deal with \nknown recurring events and problems) to dynamic learning (which encourages problem \nreformulation and novel thinking to facilitate knowledge creation). Such learning is best encouraged \nwithin an academic environment that stresses and encourages critical debate of the status quo, with \nan atmosphere of wide freedom of expression. \nSecondly, the growth of knowledge and the increasing use of information technologies is \nmaking civil society increasingly complex, making it more difficult, yet more important, to hold \ngovernment and its agencies to account for their actions. Events in the last decade, and e especially \nsince the terrorist attacks on the USA in September 2001, have led to the questioning of government \npolicy, by the public at large and academics (attempting to understand why such attacks took place), \nbeing denounced as unpatriotic, with the result that \u2018[t]he free expression of ideas means something \nentirely different at the start of the 21st century than it did only a decade ago\u2019 (Tierney and Lechuga \n2005, 13). For example, Cooper relates that \u2018[c]riticisms of the professoriate monopolized much of \nthe post-September 11 conversations regarding higher education and academic freedom\u2019 (Cooper \n2003, 77), while Strauss\u2019 case study demonstrates how \u2018the disruption and public outcry (were) \ncited to negate so-called \u201cacademic freedom\u201d and to censure a Professor\u2019s right to free expression\u2019 \n(Strauss 2004, 345f). For democracy to thrive within an open and tolerant society, academic \nfreedom needs to be protected, to ensure that students can be encouraged, by example and \n p.19 \ninstruction, into independent thinking and critical reasoning, and thereby better fulfill their \nresponsibilities as active, participative citizens within an increasingly global community. As Robert \nHutchins, the educational philosopher and President and Chancellor of Chicago University \nobserved: \u2018The object of the educational system, taken as a whole, is not to produce hands for \nindustry or to teach the young how to make a living. It is to produce responsible citizens\u2019 (Hutchins \n1953, 3). \nHistorical analyses reveal that academic freedom was hard won within the early universities of \nEurope, with some academics (like Giordano Bruno) paying for their beliefs with their lives, while \nothers moved to different cities (for example, from Paris to Oxford) and countries to escape \npersecution and continue with their research and teaching without censure or constraint. The \ndisinclination for contemporary academics to protect their academic freedom with similar vigour is \ndisheartening. For example, surveying the abolition of the right of employment tenure for \nacademics in 1988 in the U.K.\u2019s universities, Halsey noted that although \u2018the demand from the state \nthat intellectual labour be proletarianised, has been conspicuously aggressive in the past decade. \nThe counter-attack has been surprisingly mild\u2019, which he attributed to \u2018another value nurtured in \nhigher education - the tolerance of hostile ideology and the patience to pursue reasoned argument\u2019 \n(Halsey 1992, 270). Such a reasoned and reasonable stance is appropriate and effective in a society \nin which factual debate and logical enquiry inform both public opinion and government policy, but \nis neither credible nor effective in current circumstances when (as, for example, in the United \nStates) half the adult population disavow Darwin\u2019s writings and believe in creationism (Miller et al. \n2006, 756), or overwhelmingly maintain that Saddam Hussein was personally involved in the 9\/11 \nattacks (Millbank and Deane 2003).  \nDuring the inter-war Great Depression, responding to press accusations of communist \ninfiltration of the academic staff at Chicago University, the President, Robert Hutchins, retorted: \n\u2018The answer to such charges against a university is not denial, nor evasion, nor apology. It is the \nassertion that free inquiry is indispensable to the good life, that universities exist for the sake of \nsuch inquiry, that without it they cease to be universities, and that such inquiry and hence \nuniversities are more necessary now than ever. The sacred trust of the universities is to carry the \ntorch of freedom\u2019 (Boyer 2002, 6). In addition to his Presidential duties, Hutchins was the Editor of \nthe Great Books of the Western World series. The author of one of the \u2018great books\u2019, the 18th-\ncentury historian Edward Gibbon (1952, 596) attributed the decline and fall of the Roman Empire to \n(amongst others) the following factor: \u2018The freedom of the mind, the source of every generous and \nrational sentiment, was destroyed by the habits of credulity and submission\u2019. Such words should \nrightfully caution university scholars that continued pavidity and reliance on reasoned argument \n p.20 \nwill do little to curtail or reverse the attacks on, and dilution of, academic freedom. The philosopher \nand Nobel Peace Laureate Albert Schweitzer (1975, 51) observed that: \u2018Example is not the main \nthing influencing others. It is the only thing\u2019. Following on from Shils\u2019 question, it is worth asking: \nIf we, as academics, allow our freedoms to be eroded so readily, what example are we passing on to \nthose we teach? \n p.21 \nReferences \nAbdel-Motaal, Mostafa B. 2002.
