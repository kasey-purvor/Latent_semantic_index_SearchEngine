First, I introduce the main account of this issue, namely Lakatos\u2019s\nproof-generated definitions. Based on a case study of definitions of random-\nness in ergodic theory, I identify three other common ways of justifying def-\ninitions: natural-world-justification, condition-justification and redundancy-\njustification. Also, I clarify the interrelationships between the different kinds\nof justification. Finally, I point out how Lakatos\u2019s ideas are limited: they fail\nto show that various kinds of justification can be found and can be reason-\nable, and they fail to acknowledge the interplay between the different kinds\nof justification.\nContents\n1 Introduction 2\n2 Lakatos\u2019s Proof-Generated Definitions 3\n3 Case Study: Randomness in Ergodic Theory 8\n4 Kinds of Justification of Definitions 11\n4.1 Natural-World-Justification . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11\n4.1.1 Weak Mixing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11\n4.1.2 Discrete-time Bernoulli-system . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13\n4.1.3 Kolmogorov-Sinai Entropy . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 14\n4.2 Condition-Justification . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 16\n4.2.1 Weak Mixing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 17\n4.2.2 Discrete-time Bernoulli-system . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 19\n4.3 Redundancy-Justification . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 21\n4.3.1 Continuous-time Bernoulli-system . . . . . . . . . . . . 22\n4.4 Occurrence of the Kinds of Justification . . . . . . . . . . . . . 23\n5 Interrelationships Between the Kinds of Justification 25\n5.1 One Argument . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 26\n5.2 Different Arguments . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 27\n6 Assessment of Lakatos\u2019s Ideas on Proof-Generated Defini-\ntions 28\n7 Conclusion 30\n1\n1 Introduction\nMathematical practice suggests that mathematical definitions are not arbi-\ntrary: for definitions to be worth studying there have to be good reasons.\nMoreover, definitions are often regarded as important mathematical knowl-\nedge [cf. Tappenden, 2008a and 2008b]. Reasoning and knowledge are classi-\ncal philosophical issues; hence reflecting on the reasons given for definitions\nis philosophically relevant.\nThese considerations motivate the guiding question of this paper: in what\nways are definitions in mathematics justified, and are these kinds of justifica-\ntion reasonable? By a justification of a definition we mean a reason provided\nfor the definition. We will concentrate on explicit definitions, which intro-\nduce a new expression by stipulating that it be semantically equivalent to\nthe definiens consisting of already-known expressions. We won\u2019t deal with\ntheir complement, implicit definitions, which assign meaning to expressions\nby imposing constraints on how to use sentences (or other longer expressions)\ncontaining them [Brown, 1999, p. 97].\nGenerally, attempting to justify definitions is reasonable: as we will see,\nif definitions were not justified, the mathematics involving these definitions\nwould be much less meaningful to us than mathematics involving definitions\nwhich were justified. Thus given our limited resources, it is better to con-\ncentrate on definitions which we can justify.1\nWhen a mathematician formulates a definition she or he has not known\nbefore, we speak of a formulation of the definition. The way a formulation of\na definition is guided usually corresponds to the way the definition is justi-\nfied when it is formulated. Thus all that will be said about the justification\nof definitions has a natural counterpart in terms of the guidance of the for-\nmulation of definitions. Since the guidance of the formulation of definitions\nderives from the justification, the latter is the main issue, and in what follows\nwe will focus on the justification of definitions.2\n1What this means for the ontology of mathematical definitions depends on the ontology\nadopted: platonists may hold that both definitions which we can and cannot justify are\nreal, but it is better to concentrate on the former for pragmatic reasons; constructivists\nmay hold that only definitions which we can justify are real.\n2Strictly speaking, the justification and the guidance of formulation are conceptually\n2\nIn this paper, in section 2, we will first discuss the state of the art of theo-\nrising about the actual mathematical practice of how definitions are justified\nin articles and books. There is hardly any philosophical discussion on this\nissue apart from Lakatos\u2019s ideas on proof-generated definitions, and hence we\nwill concentrate on them. While Lakatos\u2019s ideas are important, this paper\naims to show how they are limited. My criticism of Lakatos starts from a case\nstudy of notions of randomness in ergodic theory, which will be introduced\nin section 3. Based on this case study, in section 4 I will introduce three\nother ways in which definitions are commonly justified: natural-world jus-\ntification, condition-justification and redundancy-justification; two of them,\nto my knowledge, have not been discussed before. In section 5 I will clarify\nthe interrelationships between the different kinds of justification, an issue\nwhich also has not been addressed before. In particular, I argue that in\ndifferent arguments the same definition can be justified in different ways.\nFinally, in section 6 I point out how Lakatos\u2019s ideas are limited: his ideas fail\nto show that often, as for notions of randomness in ergodic theory, various\nkinds of justification are found and that various kinds of justification can be\nreasonable. Furthermore, they fail to acknowledge the interplay between the\ndifferent kinds of justification.\nThis research is in the spirit of \u2018phenomenological philosophy of mathe-\nmatics\u2019 as recently characterised by Larvor [2001, pp. 214\u2013215] and Leng [2002,\npp. 3\u20135]: it looks at mathematics \u2018from the inside\u2019 and on this basis asks\nphilosophical questions.\n2 Lakatos\u2019s Proof-Generated Definitions\nIn the relatively recent literature Larvor [2001, p. 218] at least mentions\nthe importance of researching the justification of mathematical definitions.\nCorfield [2003, chapter 9] discusses the related issue of what makes fun-\ndamental concepts but does not provide conceptual reflection on our ques-\ntion. Tappenden [2008a and 2008b] treats the related issues of naturalness\ndistinct. For instance, it could be that a definition which captures an important preformal\nidea was randomly formulated by a computer; then there was no way the formulation of\nthe definition was guided, but there is a convincing initial justification.\n3\nof definitions and how to decide between different definitions. In our context\nTappenden\u2019s [2008a] conclusion is relevant: namely, that judgments about\ndefinitions mainly depend not on the rules of logic but on detailed knowledge\nabout the mathematics involved. Furthermore, several philosophers have ar-\ngued that mathematical definitions should capture a valuable preformal idea\n[cf. Brown, 1999, p. 109].\nApart from this, the main philosopher who has written on our guiding\nquestion in the light of mathematical practice is Lakatos [1976]. Lakatos\ndevelops an approach of informal mathematics, which includes an account\nof mathematical progress called proofs and refutations. Most importantly,\nLakatos is also concerned with how definitions are justified. His key idea is the\nnotion of a proof-generated definition. Here his main example are definitions\nof polyhedron which are justified because they are needed to make the proof\nof the Eulerian conjecture work: viz. that for every polyhedron the number\nof vertices minus the number of edges plus the number of faces equals two\n(V \u2212 E + F = 2).\nWhat is a proof-generated definition? Unfortunately, Lakatos does not\nstate exactly what he means by this. Clearly, mathematical definitions justi-\nfied in any way are eventually involved in proofs. Therefore, the trivial idea\nthat definitions are justified because they are involved in proofs cannot be\nwhat interested Lakatos.\nTo find out more, consider the Carathe\u00b4odory definition of measurable sets,\nanother proof-generated definition Lakatos discusses. The mathematician\nHalmos [1950, p. 44] remarks on this definition: \u201cThe greatest justification\nof this apparently complicated concept is, however, its possibly surprising\nbut absolute complete success as a tool of proving the extension theorem\u201d.\nLakatos [1976, p. 153] comments:\nas we learn from the second part [Halmos\u2019s remark above], this\nconcept is a proof-generated concept in Carathe\u00b4odory\u2019s theorem\nabout the extension of measures [...]. So whether it is intuitive or\nnot is not at all interesting: its rationale lies not in its intuitive-\nness but in its proof-ancestor.\nThis quote and the rest of the discussion of proof-generated definitions sug-\n4\ngests that a proof-generated definition is a definition which is needed in order\nto prove a specific conjecture regarded as valuable [Lakatos, 1976, pp. 88\u201392,\npp. 127\u2013133, pp. 144\u201354]. This idea is also hinted at by Polya [1954, p. 148].\nThe final theorems which involve proof-generated definitions often, but not\nalways, result from a series of trials and revisions.\nLakatos [1976, pp. 33\u201350, p. 127] rightly argues that lemma-incorporation\nproduces proof-generated definitions: assume that a conjecture, known not\nto hold for all objects of a domain, should be established. Then if conditions\nwhich are needed in order to prove the conjecture are identified, i.e. lemmas\nare incorporated, proof-generated definitions arise. For instance, consider\nthe conjecture that the limit function of a convergent sequence of continu-\nous functions is continuous. This conjecture can be proven if \u2018convergent\u2019 is\nunderstood as uniformly convergent but not if it is understood as the more\nobvious, weaker pointwise convergent; hence the definition of uniformly con-\nvergent is proof-generated [Lakatos, 1976, pp. 144\u2013146].\nLakatos [1976, pp. 90\u201392, p. 128, pp. 148\u2013149, p. 153] thinks that for his\nexamples of proof-generated definitions the justification was reasonable be-\ncause the corresponding conjectures are valuable. Generally, if the conjecture\nis mathematically valuable, proof-generation is a reasonable kind of justifica-\ntion.3 A proof-generated definition can be regarded as providing knowledge\nsince it answers the question of which notion is needed to prove a specific\nconjecture.\nLakatos [1976, pp. 14\u201333, pp. 83\u201387] also discusses four other ways of\njustifying definitions. Imagine that counterexamples are presented to a con-\njecture of interest, and that the conjecture is defended by claiming that these\nare no \u201creal\u201d counterexamples because a definition in the conjecture has been\nwrongly understood. Properly understood, it is argued, the definition ex-\ncludes a class of objects which includes the alleged counterexamples, where\nthe exclusions are made independent of any proof of the conjecture (and thus\nit is unknown whether the conjecture indeed holds true for the definition).\nThen the definition is justified via monster-barring. The second kind of jus-\n3For the proof-generated definitions discussed in Lakatos [1976] and in this it is argued\nwhy the conjectures are valuable. Yet answering the question of what constitutes valuable\nconjectures at a general level would require further research.\n5\ntification is exception-barring. Here the definition is defended by excluding,\nwith the extant definition, a class of objects which are counterexamples to\nthe conjecture; again, this is independent of any proof of the conjecture.4\nThe third kind of justification is monster-adjustment. Here the definition is\ndefended by reinterpreting, independent of any proof of the conjecture, the\nterms of the extant definition such that counterexamples to the conjecture\nare no longer counterexamples any longer. The fourth and final kind of jus-\ntification is monster-including. Here the definition is defended by extending\nthe definition to include a new class of objects; this class of objects is defined\nusing properties which are shared by examples for which the conjecture holds\ntrue; and again, this is independent of any proof of the conjecture.\nMonster-barring, exception-barring and monster-adjustment are all ways\nof dealing with counterexamples to conjectures. And I agree with Lakatos\nthat for this purpose they are inferior to proof-generation because they do\nnot take into account how the conjectures are proved; and therefore, it is\neven unclear whether the conjecture is true for the definition under consid-\neration. Monster-including is a way of generalising conjectures. Yet again,\nsince it neglects how conjectures are proved, I agree with Lakatos that for\nthis purpose it is inferior to proof-generation. Furthermore, Lakatos thought\nthat any of these kinds of justification were applied only because the better\nway of justifying definitions, namely with proof-generation, was not known\n[Lakatos 1976, pp. 14\u201342, pp. 136\u2013140]. Because of their inadequacies and\nsince they play no role in our case study, I shan\u2019t say any more about these\nkinds of justification in this paper.\nUnfortunately, Lakatos [1976] never explicitly states how widely he thinks\nthat his ideas on proof-generated definitions apply. General claims such as\nProgress indeed replaces naive classification by [...] proof-generated\n[...]classification. [...]Naive conjectures and naive concepts are su-\nperseded by improved conjectures (theorems) and concepts (proof-\ngenerated [...] concepts) growing out of the method of proofs and\nrefutations [Lakatos, 1976, pp. 91\u201392; see also p. 144].\n4Contrary to exception-barring, in the case of monster-barring it is denied that the\ncounterexamples are actual counterexamples. This is how monster-barring differs from\nexception-barring.\n6\nsuggest that mathematical definitions should be, and after the discovery of\nproof-generation are generally proof-generated, and some have interpreted\nhim as saying this [Brown, 1999, pp. 110\u2013111]. However, as Larvor [1998]\nhas pointed out, Lakatos stresses in his PhD-thesis, on which his 1976 book\nis based, that his account of informal mathematics does not apply to all of\nmathematics. What is clear is that Lakatos thought that there are many\nmathematical subjects with some proof-generated definitions and that there\nare many mathematical subjects with some definitions which should be proof-\ngenerated.5 Maybe Lakatos also believed something stronger, and this would\nexplain his strong claims such as in the above quote, namely that there are\nmany subjects where proof-generation should be the sole important way in\nwhich definitions are justified; and that there are many subjects created\nafter the discovery of proof-generation where proof-generation is the sole\nimportant way in which definitions are justified. In what follows, I will show\nin which ways Lakatos\u2019s ideas on justifying definitions are limited; and for\nthis it won\u2019t matter much whether or not he endorsed the stronger claim.\nCorfield [1997, pp. 111\u2013115] argues that Lakatos did not think that his\naccount of informal mathematics, which includes his ideas on justifying def-\ninitions, extends to established branches of mathematics of \u201cthe twentieth\ncentury and up to the present day\u201d. Yet Corfield\u2019s claim is implausible.\nLakatos [1976, p. 5, pp. 152\u2013154] states that his ideas on informal mathemat-\nics apply to modern metamathematics and to Carathe\u00b4odory\u2019s [1914] investi-\ngations on measurable sets. And substantial parts of established mathematics\nof the twentieth century up to the present day are not more formalised than\nthat mathematics: e.g. ergodic theory, which will be relevant later. Thus\nLakatos indeed thought that his ideas could apply to substantial parts of es-\ntablished branches of mathematics of the twentieth century up to the present\nday. But I agree with Corfield\u2019s [1997] main point that Lakatos failed to see\nthat his ideas are also relevant for highly formalised mathematics. For this\nreason this paper is not restricted to informal mathematics.\nThis discussion highlights that there is little work on the actual practice\nof how definitions are justified in articles and books. Furthermore, although\n5Of course, the question remains what a \u2018mathematical subject\u2019 is; I will say more\nabout this later [cf. section 4.4].\n7\nLakatos\u2019s account of proofs and refutations has been challenged [Corfield,\n1997; Leng, 2002], his ideas on proof-generated definitions have hardly been\ncriticised. My contribution on the guiding question and my criticism of\nLakatos\u2019s ideas on justifying definitions will be based on a case study of\nnotions of randomness in ergodic theory. Let me now introduce this case\nstudy.\n3 Case Study: Randomness in Ergodic The-\nory\nMy case study is on notions of randomness in ergodic theory. Ergodic the-\nory originated from work in statistical mechanics, in particular Boltzmann\u2019s\nkinetic theory of gases. Boltzmann\u2019s work relied on the assumption that the\ntime-average of a function equals its space average, but no acceptable argu-\nment was provided for this. Generally, the possible random motion of clas-\nsical systems was a constant theme in statistical mechanics. Ergodic theory\narose in the early 1930s when von Neumann and Birkhoff proved the famous\nmean and pointwise ergodic theorem, respectively. Among other things, they\nfound that ergodicity was the sought-after concept guaranteeing the equality\nof time and space averages for almost all states of the system. Motivated\nby these results, an investigation into the random behaviour of classical sys-\ntems began. Of particular importance here was the study of randomness by\na group of mathematicians around Kolmogorov in Russia. From the 1960\u2019s\nonwards, ergodic theory became prominent, and was further developed, as a\nmathematical framework for studying chaotic behaviour, i.e. unpredictable\nand random behaviour of deterministic systems. Overall, ergodic theory had\nless impact on statistical mechanics than expected, partly because of the\ndoubts, and the difficulty of proving, that the relevant systems are ergodic.\nBut it developed into a discipline with its own internal problems and had,\nand continues to have, considerable impact on probability theory and chaos\nresearch [Aubin and Dahan-Dalmedico, 2002; Mackey, 1974].\nWhy do notions of randomness in ergodic theory constitute a valuable case\nstudy? First, several of Lakatos\u2019s assertions, e.g. that mathematics is driven\n8\nby counterexamples, have been criticised in the following way: while they\nmay be correct for older mathematics, they do not hold true for twentieth\ncentury mathematics [Leng, 2002, p. 10]. As also Lakatos [1976, pp. 136\u2013140]\nsuggests, how definitions are justified may depend on when they were formu-\nlated because reasoning changes with the advancement of mathematics. To\nensure that claims on the justification of definitions escape the criticism of\nnot applying to twentieth century mathematics, I choose mathematics, like\nergodic theory, which was created in the twentieth century. Second, con-\ncerning the justification of definitions the picture for notions of randomness\nin ergodic theory appeared different to that proposed by Lakatos, and this\npicture seemed prevalent in mathematics.\nAs widely acknowledged, the main notions of randomness in ergodic the-\nory are [cf. Berkovitz et al., 2006; Sinai, 2000, p. 21, pp. 41\u201346; Walters,\n1982, pp. 39\u201341, pp. 86\u201387, pp. 105\u2013107]:\nweak mixing (three versions), strong mixing (two versions), Kolmogorov-\nmixing, Kolmogorov-system, Bernoulli-system (two versions), Kolmogorov-\nSinai entropy.\nI studied how the definitions listed above are justified and whether they are\nreasonably justified. I also examined the way the definitions were initially\njustified.6\nIn the remaining sections of this paper the insights on the justification\nof definitions which derive from this case study will be presented. The def-\ninitions of the above list which are italicised will be discussed in detail. A\ndetailed investigation of them will suffice to illustrate these insights. Hence\nfor the remaining listed definitions I will just state how they are justified.\nBasic knowledge of measure theory will suffice to understand the mathemat-\nics that follows. Yet the claims can also be grasped without understanding\n6I did not investigate the use of these definitions elsewhere in mathematics. The main\nreason for such an investigation would have been to understand how the justification of\ndefinitions varies in different contexts. Yet I could find out about this by considering only\nhow definitions were initially justified and later justified as notions of randomness. Going\nfurther would have required an enormous amount of work without considerable gain.\n9\nthe relevant mathematics if close attention is paid to the verbal commentary\non the definitions.\nFirst of all, the unit of analysis in ergodic theory, namely measure-\ntheoretic dynamical systems, needs to be introduced. Generally, dynamical\nsystems are mathematical models consisting of a phase space, the set of all\npossible states of the system, and an evolution equation which describes how\nsolutions evolve in phase space. Dynamical systems usually model natural\nsystems.\nThere are discrete and continuous dynamical systems. For discrete sys-\ntems time increases in discrete steps. Continuous systems involve a contin-\nuous time parameter; they typically arise from differential equations. Only\nfor one definition of randomness in ergodic theory there is a considerable\ndifference between the discrete and continuous version, and here I will dis-\ncuss both versions. All other notions of randomness are essentially the same\nfor discrete and continuous time, and hence, for simplicity, we confine our\nattention to the discrete notions.\nErgodic theory is concerned with measure-theoretic dynamical systems.\nA discrete measure-theoretic dynamical system is a quadruple (X,\u03a3, \u00b5, T )\nwhere X is a set (phase space), \u03a3 is a \u03c3-algebra on X, \u00b5 is a measure with\n\u00b5(X) = 1 and T : X \u2192 X (evolution equation) is bijective measurable map\nwhich is measure-preserving, i.e. \u00b5(T (A)) = \u00b5(A) for all A \u2208 \u03a3. A continuous\nmeasure-theoretic dynamical system is a quadruple (X,\u03a3, \u00b5, Tt) where X is\na set (phase space), \u03a3 is a \u03c3-algebra on X, \u00b5 is a measure with \u00b5(X) = 1,\nand Tt : X \u2192 X, t \u2208 R, (evolution equation) is a group of measurable\nand measure-preserving bijective maps such that additionally the function\n\u03a6(x, t) := Tt(x) is measurable on X \u00d7 R [cf. Cornfeld et al. 1982, pp. 3\u20136].\nWith this background we can now discuss the kinds of justification which\noccur in my case study. They illustrate that not only proof-generation is\nimportant.\n10\n4 Kinds of Justification of Definitions\n4.1 Natural-World-Justification\nI claim, first, that definitions in my case study are frequently justified be-\ncause they capture a preformal idea regarded as valuable for describing or\nunderstanding the natural world. Here I will speak of natural-world-justified\ndefinitions. Natural-world-justified definitions are a special case of the gen-\neral idea discussed in the literature that mathematical definitions should\ncapture a valuable preformal idea [cf. Brown, 1999, p. 109].\nIf the preformal idea is valuable for describing or understanding the natu-\nral world, natural-world-justification is reasonable. It is important to realise\nthat natural-world-justification does not mean that there is a \u2018best\u2019 definition\nof a vague idea. There can be several different definitions expressing a vague\nidea without a clearly \u2018best\u2019 one. Natural-world-justified definitions can be\nregarded as providing knowledge in the following sense: they are a possible\nformalisation of a preformal idea which is valuable.\nMany definitions of the list of notions of randomness [cf. section 3] are\nnatural-world-justified: we will now discuss weak mixing (one version), Bernoulli-\nsystem (one version) and the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy in detail. For illus-\ntrating natural-world-justification, it would suffice to consider the Kolmogorov-\nSinai entropy. The discussion of the remaining two definitions is crucial in\norder to provide the necessary background for the next sections. Moreover, all\nversions of strong mixing [Berkovitz et al., 2006, p. 676; Hopf, 1932a, p. 205]\nand Kolmogorov-mixing [Sinai, 1963, p. 66] are natural-world-justified.\n4.1.1 Weak Mixing\nDefinition 1 (X,\u03a3, \u00b5, T ) is weakly mixing iff for all A,B \u2208 \u03a3 there is a\nP \u2286 N of density zero such that\nlim\nn\u2192\u221e, n\/\u2208P\n\u00b5(T n(A) \u2229B) = \u00b5(A)\u00b5(B),\nwhere P \u2286 N is of density zero iff limn\u2192\u221e#(P \u2229 {i | i \u2264 n, i \u2208 N})\/n = 0.\nFor (X,\u03a3, \u00b5, T ) and A \u2208 \u03a3 define At as the event that the system\u2019s state\nis in A at time t, and let p(...) denote the probability of events. Because time\n11\nis discrete, we can denote time points by tn, n \u2208 Z. Assume, as it is often\ndone, that the measure can be interpreted as time-independent probability:\np(At) = \u00b5(A) and p(At&Bt) = \u00b5(A \u2229 B) for all t and all A,B \u2208 \u03a3 [see\nWerndl, 2009, for more on this]. Then it follows that for all tm, tn, tm \u2265 tn,\nand all A,B \u2208 \u03a3:7\np(Atn&Btm) = \u00b5(Tm\u2212n(A) \u2229B). (1)\nBy writing out the definition of limit, the definiens of Definition 1 says\nthat for any A,B \u2208 \u03a3 and any \u03b5 > 0 there is a n0 \u2208 N and a set P of density\nzero with |\u00b5(T n(A) \u2229 B)\u2212\u00b5(A)\u00b5(B)|< \u03b5 for all n \u2265 n0, n \/\u2208 P . Equation\n(1) thus tells us that Definition 1 captures the following idea of random-\nness: given an arbitrary level of precision \u03b5 > 0 any event is approximately\nindependent of almost any event that is sufficiently past. Independence is un-\nderstood here as in probability theory. This randomness might apply, e.g. to\nsystems in meteorology and make it hard to predict them.\nVon Neumann [1932, p. 591, p. 594] lists the main statistical properties of\nclassical systems discussed in ergodic theory and that time. In this context\nhe remarks that Definition 1 captures the preformal idea of approximate\nindependence of almost all events explained above. Thus he argues that it is\nnatural-world justified. This justification grew in importance with the rise of\nchaos research in the 1960s [cf. Berkovitz et al., 2006, p. 688]. It also appears\nin a few standard books on ergodic theory [e.g. Walters, 1982, p. 45], although\nin books often no justification is provided for weak mixing [e.g. Arnold and\nAvez, 1968, pp. 21-22; Cornfeld et al., 1982, pp. 22\u201323; Sinai, 2000, p. 21].\nEspecially before the rise of chaos research weak mixing appears to be\nmostly not naturally-world justified. We will see this in section 4.2, where\nwe will also discuss the key contexts in which weak mixing was introduced.\nThe next definition relates to the important topic of equivalence of measure-\ntheoretic systems.\n7Tm\u2212n(A) is the evolution of A forward in time from tn to tm, containing exactly those\npoints that are in A at time tn. Consequently, Tm\u2212n(A) \u2229 B consists of exactly those\npoints which pass A at time tn and go through B at time tm, i.e. for which Atn&Btm is\ntrue. Therefore, p(Atn&Btm) = \u00b5(Tm\u2212n(A) \u2229B).\n12\n4.1.2 Discrete-time Bernoulli-system\nThe idea of an infinite sequence of independent trials of an N -sided die is a\nvery old one. Kolmogorov [1933] gave the modern measure-theoretic formula-\ntion of probability theory and laid the foundations for the theory of stochastic\nprocesses [von Plato, 1994, pp. 230\u2013233]. In this modern framework an in-\ndependent process, i.e. a doubly-infinite sequence of independent rolls of an\nN -sided die where the probability of obtaining k is pk, k\u2208 N\u00af := {1, . . . , N},\nwith\n\u2211N\nk=1 pk = 1, is modeled as follows. Let X be the set of all bi-infinite\nsequences (. . . x\u22121, x0, x1 . . .) with xi \u2208 N\u00af , corresponding to the possible out-\ncomes of an infinite sequence of independent trials. Let \u03a3 be the set of all\nsets of infinite sequences to which probabilities can be assigned, and let \u00b5 be\nthe probability function on \u03a3.8 The shift\nT : X \u2192 X T ((. . . xi . . .)) = (. . . xi+1 . . .) (2)\nis easily seen to be measurable and measure-preserving. (X,\u03a3, \u00b5, T ) is called\na Bernoulli-shift.\nIn one of the first papers on ergodic theory von Neumann [1932] intro-\nduced the fundamental idea of equivalence of measure-theoretic systems. He\ndeveloped the definition of isomorphic systems to capture this idea [Sinai,\n1989, p. 833],9 and called for a classification of systems up to isomorphism.\nConsequently, we see that the following definition captures the idea of\nsystems which are equivalent to a system describing an independent process,\ne.g. throwing a die:\nDefinition 2 (X,\u03a3, \u00b5, T ) is a Bernoulli-system iff it is isomorphic to a\nBernoulli shift.\n8In detail: \u03a3 is the \u03c3-algebra generated by the cylinder-sets\nCk1...kni1...in ={x \u2208 X |xi1=k1, ..., xin=kn, ij \u2208Z, i1< ... <in, kj \u2208 N\u00af , 1\u2264 j\u2264 n}.\nThe sets have probability \u00b5\u00af(Ck1...kni1...in ) = pk1pk2 . . . pkn since the outcomes are independent.\n\u00b5 is defined as the unique extension of \u00b5\u00af to a measure on \u03a3.\n9(X1,\u03a31, \u00b51, T1) is isomorphic to (X2,\u03a32, \u00b52, T2) iff there are measurable sets X\u00afi \u2286 Xi\nwith \u00b5i(Xi \\ X\u00afi) = 0 and TiX\u00afi \u2286 X\u00afi (i = 1, 2), and there is a bijection \u03c6 : X\u00af1\u2192 X\u00af2 such\nthat (i) \u03c6(A)\u2208\u03a32 for all A\u2208\u03a31, A \u2286 X\u00af1, and \u03c6\u22121(B) \u2208 \u03a31 for all B \u2208 \u03a32, B \u2286 X\u00af2; (ii)\n\u00b52(\u03c6(A)) = \u00b51(A) for all A \u2208 \u03a31, A \u2286 X\u00af1; (iii) \u03c6(T1(x)) = T2(\u03c6(x)) for all x \u2208 X\u00af1.\n13\nIn many articles Definition 2 is natural-world-justified in that way [Ornstein,\n1989, p. 4; Rohlin, 1960, p. 5]. Walter\u2019s [1982, p. 107; see also Ornstein,\n1974, p. 4] comment\nSince a Bernoulli shift is really an independent identically dis-\ntributed stochastic process indexed by the integers we can think\nof a {Bernoulli-system} as an abstraction of such a stochastic\nprocess.10\nshows that this justification is found in standard books on ergodic theory too.\nYet some books do not provide any justification for Definition 2 [e.g. Shields,\n1973, p. 5].\nClearly, the Bernoulli-shifts given by choices of N and, for each N , the\nchoices of p1, . . . pN are Bernoulli-systems. We will say later more about when\nBernoulli-shifts are isomorphic.\nThe next definition illustrates that a definition can be both preformal-\njustified and proof-generated.\n4.1.3 Kolmogorov-Sinai Entropy\n\u03b1 = {a1, . . . , ak}, k \u2265 1, is a partition of a system (X,\u03a3, \u00b5, T ) iff ai \u2208 \u03a3,\nai \u2229 aj = \u2205 for i 6= j, 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 k, and X =\n\u22c3k\ni=1 ai. Clearly, T\nn\u03b1 :=\n{T na1, . . . , T nak}, n \u2208 Z, is also a partition.\nDynamical systems and information theory can be connected as follows:\neach x \u2208 X produces, relative to a partition \u03b1, an infinite string of symbols\nx0x1x2 . . . in an alphabet of k letters via the coding xj = \u03b1i iff T\nj(x) \u2208\n\u03b1i, j \u2265 0. Interpreting the system (X,\u03a3, \u00b5, T ) as the source, the output\nof the source are these strings x0x1x2 . . .. If the measure is interpreted as\ntime-independent probability, H(\u03b1, T ) :=\nlim\nn\u2192\u221e\n1\/n\n\u2211\nij\u2208{1,...,k},0\u2264j\u2264n\u22121\n\u2212\u00b5(\u03b1i0 \u2229 T\u03b1i1 . . . \u2229 T n\u22121\u03b1in\u22121) log(\u00b5(\u03b1i0 . . . \u2229 T n\u22121\u03b1in\u22121)) (3)\nmeasures the average information which the system produces per step relative\nto \u03b1 as time goes to infinity [Petersen, 1983, pp. 233\u2013240]. Now:\n10Square brackets indicate that the original notation has been replaced by the notion\nused in this paper. I will use this convention throughout.\n14\nDefinition 3 h(T ) := sup\u03b1{H(\u03b1, T )} is the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy of\nthe system (X,\u03a3, \u00b5, T ).\nIt measures the highest average amount of information that the system can\nproduce per step relative to a coding, and a positive entropy indicates that\ninformation is produced.\nHaving worked for several years on information theory, Kolmogorov [1958]\nwas the first to apply information-theoretic ideas to ergodic theory. He intro-\nduced a definition of entropy only for what is nowadays called Kolmogorov-\nsystems. Based on Kolmogorov\u2019s work, Sinai [1959] introduced a different\nnotion of entropy which applies to all systems, the now canonical Definition 3.\nSinai also proved\u2014a big surprise at that time\u2014that automorphisms on the\ntorus have positive entropy and thus are random because they produce infor-\nmation. Kolmogorov and Sinai were motivated by finding a concept which\ncharacterises the amount of randomness of a system [Sinai, 2007; Werndl,\nforthcoming]. More specifically, as Halmos [1961, p. 76; cf. Sinai, 1959] ex-\nplains: \u201cIntuitively speaking, the entropy h(T ) is the greatest quantity of\ninformation obtainable about the universe per day [i.e. step] by repeated\nperformances of experiments with a finite [...] number of outcomes\u201d. Hence\nDefinition 3 is natural-world-justified by capturing the idea of the average\namount of information produced per step explained above.\nAlso in some standard books on ergodic theory Definition 3 is natural-\nworld-justified in this way [Billingsley, 1965, p. 63; Petersen, 1983, pp. 233\u2013\n240]. It should, however, be mentioned that in books Definition 3 is often\nnot justified at all [e.g. Arnold and Avez, 1968, pp. 35\u201350; Cornfeld et al.,\n1982, pp. 246\u2013257; Sinai, 2000, pp. 40\u201343].\nInterestingly, the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy is also proof-generated. And\nit is the only notion of randomness in ergodic theory [cf. section 3] which is\nproof-generated. The central internal problem of ergodic theory is the follow-\ning: which systems are isomorphic [cf. subsection 4.1.2]? Using the so-called\nKoopman formalism, dynamical systems can be investigated from a spectral-\ntheoretic viewpoint. Systems which are equivalent from this viewpoint are\nsaid to be spectrally-isomorphic. In the 1950s it was known that systems\nwith discrete spectrum are isomorphic if and only if they are spectrally-\nisomorphic and that this is not so for systems with mixed spectrum. Most\n15\nimportantly, however, is the case of a continuous spectrum since dynamical\nsystems typically have this property [Arnold and Avez, 1968, pp. 27\u201332].11\nFor systems with continuous spectrum, e.g. Bernoulli-systems, the conjecture\nemerged that spectrally-isomorphic systems are not always isomorphic, but\nthe problem resisted solution.\nKolmogorov [1958] and Sinai [1959] were motivated by making progress\nabout this conjecture [Sinai, 1989, p. 834\u2013836], and Kolmogorov\u2019s [1958] main\nresult is that this conjecture is true. As hinted at by Rohlin [1960, pp. 1\u20132,\np. 8], the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy can be justified as being precisely the def-\ninition which is needed to prove that conjecture, i.e. it is proof-generated. The\nargument, which goes back to Kolmogorov\u2019s work, is as follows: isomorphic\nsystem have the same Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy. Now look at Bernoulli-\nshifts, whose Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy\n\u2211\ni pi log(pi) takes a continuum of\ndifferent values. Since all Bernoulli-shifts are spectrally-isomorphic, there is\na continuum of systems being spectrally-isomorphic but not isomorphic.\nBillingsley\u2019s [1965, p. 65] comment\nIt is essential to understand the difference between H(\u03b1, T ) and\nh(T ) and why the latter is introduced. If the entropy of T were\ntaken to be H(\u03b1, T ) for some \u201cnaturally\u201d selected \u03b1 [...], then it\nwould be useless for the isomorphism problem.\nshows that the justification of Definition 3 as being proof-generated made it\ninto standard books on ergodic theory too [see also Petersen, 1983, p. 227,\np. 246].\nLet us turn to the second kind of justification I have identified.\n4.2 Condition-Justification\nI claim that another kind of justification abounds in my case study: a defini-\ntion is justified by the fact that it is equivalent in an allegedly natural way to\na previously specified condition which is regarded as mathematically valuable.\nWe speak here of condition-justified definitions.\n11Systems have continuous spectrum iff their only eigenfunctions are constant functions.\n16\nIf the previously specified condition is valuable and the kind of equiva-\nlence is natural, condition-justification is a reasonable kind of justification.12\nA condition-justified definition can be regarded as providing knowledge be-\ncause it answers the question of which definition corresponds naturally to a\npreviously specified condition.\nTwo definitions of the notions of randomness in ergodic theory [cf. sec-\ntion 3] are condition-justified, namely weak mixing (all versions) and Bernoulli-\nsystem (one version) are condition-justified. Let us discuss them now.\n4.2.1 Weak Mixing\nRecall Definition 1 of weak mixing. Two alternative equivalent definitions\nare [Petersen, 1983, pp. 65\u201367]:\nDefinition 4 (X,\u03a3, \u00b5, T ) is weakly mixing iff for all A,B \u2208 \u03a3\nlim\nn\u2192\u221e\n1\nn\nn\u22121\u2211\ni=0\n|\u00b5(T i(A) \u2229B)\u2212 \u00b5(A)\u00b5(B)| = 0.\nDefinition 5 (X,\u03a3, \u00b5, T ) is weakly mixing iff for all f, g \u2208 L2(X,\u03a3, \u00b5)\nlim\nn\u2192\u221e\n1\nn\nn\u22121\u2211\ni=0\n|\n\u222b\nf(T i(x))g(x)d\u00b5\u2212\n\u222b\nf(x)d\u00b5\n\u222b\ng(x)d\u00b5 |= 0,\nwhere L2(X,\u03a3, \u00b5) is the Hilbert space of square integrable functions on\n(X,\u03a3, \u00b5).\nWe already argued that Definition 1 can be natural-world-justified. The\nfirst three papers discussing weak mixing seem to be Hopf [1932a], Hopf\n[1932b], and Koopman and von Neumann [1932]. These papers show that\nthere is more to say for three reasons.\nFirst, Hopf [1932a] starts by emphasising the importance of ergodicity\nfor statistical mechanics. He then considers another statistical property dis-\ncussed by Poincare\u00b4: when initially a certain part of a fluid is coloured, experi-\nence shows that after a long time the colour uniformly dissolves in the fluid.\n12For the condition-justified definitions of my case study we will see why the conditions\nare valuable and the equivalences are natural. Yet characterising what constitutes valuable\nconditions or natural kinds of equivalence at a general level would require further research.\n17\nMathematically, Hopf expresses this by strong mixing.13 Interested in the\ninterrelationship between strong mixing and ergodicity, he conjectures that\na continuous system (X,\u03a3, \u00b5, Tt) is strongly mixing iff for all t the discrete-\ntime transformation T t is ergodic.14 Yet he is unable to prove this (it was\nlater shown to be false). As a result, Hopf attends to the question which\nweaker statistical property is equivalent to the condition that for all t the\ntransformation T t is ergodic. The answer he arrives at is Definition 5. There-\nfore, weak mixing is condition-justified because its justification stems from\nit being equivalent in a natural way to a condition regarded as valuable.\nSecond, Hopf [1932b] is concerned with Gibbs fundamental hypothesis\nthat any initial distribution tends toward statistical equilibrium, and he de-\nrives several conditions under which this hypothesis holds true. Within this\ncontext, he becomes interested in how properties of a system (X,\u03a3, \u00b5, T )\nrelate to the composite system (X \u00d7 X,\u03a3 \u00d7 \u03a3, \u00b5 \u00d7 \u00b5, T \u00d7 T ) comprising\ntwo copies of the single system. Because of the importance of ergodicity, it\nis natural to ask: which property of the single system is equivalent to the\ncomposite system being ergodic? Hopf [1932b] provides the answer, namely\nDefinition 5 of weak mixing. Hence weak mixing is condition-justified as\nHalmos [1949, p. 1022] stresses by referring to Definition 1 and 4: an \u201cin-\ndication that weak mixing is more than an analytic artificiality is in the\nassertion that T is weakly mixing if and only if its direct product with itself\nis indecomposable [ergodic]\u201d.\nThird, when discussing Definition 3, we encountered the property of a\ncontinuous spectrum which arises in spectral theory. Koopman and von\nNeumann [1932] emphasise the naturalness of, and devote their paper to,\nthis property. From the beginning of ergodic theory the correspondence of\nconcepts from spectral theory and set-theoretic and integral-theoretic con-\ncepts from ergodic theory has been a core theme. Hence it was natural to\naddress the question, as Koopman and von Neumann did, which set-theoretic\n13(X,\u03a3, \u00b5, T ) is strongly mixing iff for all A,B \u2208 \u03a3\nlim\nn\u2192\u221e\u00b5(T\nn(A) \u2229B) = \u00b5(A)\u00b5(B).\n14A system (X,\u03a3, \u00b5, T ) is ergodic iff for all A \u2208 \u03a3 if T (A) = A, then \u00b5(A) = 0 or 1.\n18\nor integral-theoretic definition is equivalent to having a continuous spectrum.\nThe answer they arrived at is Definition 1 of weak mixing. Thus, again, weak\nmixing is condition-justified.\nI have found no book motivating weak mixing by the condition that for\nall t the transformation T t is ergodic. This might be because that character-\nisation does not hold for discrete systems.15 The other two interpretations\nof weak mixing as condition-justified appear in standard books on ergodic\ntheory, e.g. Halmos [1956, p. 39] and Petersen [1983, p. 64]. The latter com-\nments:\nThat the concept of weak mixing is natural and important can\nbe seen from the following theorem, according to which a trans-\nformation is weakly mixing if and only if its only measurable\neigenfunctions are the constants.\nTo summarise, all versions of weak mixing are condition-justified because\ntheir justification stems from their being equivalent in a natural way to a\ncondition regarded as valuable. The next definition illustrates the danger of\nnot appreciating that a definition is condition-justified.\n4.2.2 Discrete-time Bernoulli-system\nRecall Definition 2 of a Bernoulli-system. The appeal to isomorphisms makes\nthis definition indirect. Furthermore, most states of the systems encountered\nin the sciences, e.g. states of Newtonian systems, are not infinite sequences.\nThus it is often easier to work without notions referring to infinite sequences.\nIn investigating simple systems isomorphic to Bernoulli-shifts, it became clear\nthat proving an isomorphism amounts to finding a partition which can be\nused to code the dynamics. Hence it was natural to ask which condition that\ndoes not appeal to isomorphisms and infinite sequences, but to partitions, is\nequivalent to a Bernoulli-system. Ornstein [1970] gives the definition which\nanswers this question:16\n15The irrational rotation of the circle is a counterexample [Petersen, 1983, p. 8].\n16Strictly speaking, it is equivalent to Definition 2 only for Lebesgue spaces. Since all\nspaces of interest are Lebesgue, this is considered unproblematic [Petersen, 1983, pp. 16\u201317\nand p. 275].\n19\nDefinition 6 (X,\u03a3, \u00b5, T ) is a Bernoulli system iff there is a partition \u03b1\nsuch that\n(i) T i\u03b1 is an independent sequence, i.e. for any distinct i1, . . . , ir \u2208 Z, and\nnot necessarily distinct \u03b1j \u2208 \u03b1, j = 1, . . . , r (r \u2265 1):\n\u00b5(T i1\u03b11 \u2229 . . . \u2229 T ir\u03b1r) = \u00b5(\u03b11) . . . \u00b5(\u03b1r).\n(ii) \u03a3 is generated by {T i\u03b1 |i \u2208 Z}.\nHence Definition 6 can be justified by the fact that it gives an answer to\nthe above question, i.e. it is condition-justified. Standard books on ergodic\ntheory also hint at that justification [Shields, 1973, p. 8, p. 11; Sinai, 2000,\np. 47].\nThere have been attempts to justify Definition 6 as capturing a preformal\nidea of randomness. Interpreting the measure as time-independent probabil-\nity, condition (i) captures the idea that any number of finite events of a\nspecific partition at different times are independent. Berkovitz et al. [2006]\nargue that because condition (i) can be thus interpreted, Bernoulli-systems\ncapture randomness;17 they do not say anything about condition (ii). Yet\nsince (i) is only one part of this definition, this justification of Definition 6\nfails.18 Generally, if a definition does not capture the idea it is said to capture,\nthe justification fails because it is unclear why this definition is chosen.\nBatterman\u2019s [1991] and Sklar\u2019s [1993, pp. 238\u2013239] motivation for Defini-\ntion 6 is also that it captures a preformal idea of randomness. Their argument\nas expressed by Batterman [1991, pp. 249\u2013250] is:\nNow let us see just how random a Bernoulli system is [...] The\n17Actually, a slip occurred in Berkovitz et al.\u2019s [2006, p. 667] interpretation of condition\n(i); (i) holds only for any finite number of events of a specific partition at different times,\nnot for any events.\n18For instance, the following system fulfills (i) but not (ii): let (X,\u03a3, \u00b5) be the ordinary\nLebesgue measure space of the unit cube X. Let\nT (x, y, z) := (2x,\ny\n2\n, z) if 0 \u2264 x < 1\n2\n, (2x\u2212 1, y + 1\n2\n, z) if\n1\n2\n\u2264 x \u2264 1.\nObviously, for (X,\u03a3, \u00b5, T ) condition (i) of Definition 6 holds for \u03b1 = {{x \u2208 X |\n0 \u2264 x < 12}, {x \u2208 X | 12 \u2264 x \u2264 1}}. But (X,\u03a3, \u00b5, T ) is not a Bernoulli-system since it\nis not ergodic.\n20\nBernoulli systems are those in which knowing the entire past his-\ntory of box-occupations even relative to a partition that is gen-\nerating in the above sense, is insufficient (in the sense of being\nprobabilistically independent) for improving the odds that the\nsystem will next be found in a given box.\nAs an interpretation of randomness this is puzzling. Even if it exactly cor-\nresponded to Definition 6,19 it is unclear, from the viewpoint of capturing\na preformal idea of randomness, why independence is required relative to\ngenerating partitions; and I found no convincing justification for this.\nIt seems that the difficulty stems from the fact that Definition 6 is really\ncondition-justified. As we have seen for weak mixing, condition-justified\ndefinitions may in other contexts also capture a preformal idea valuable in\nsome sense. However, often\u2014and this is true for Definition 6 as discussed\u2014\nthis won\u2019t be the case. Then there is the danger of not appreciating that\na definition is condition-justified and claiming that it captures a valuable\npreformal idea, when it does not. It seems that in interpreting Definition 6\nBatterman and Sklar fell into this trap. This danger is similar to the one\nidentified by [Lakatos, 1976, p. 153], viz. claiming that a proof-generated\ndefinition captures a valuable preformal idea when it does not.\nLet us now turn to the final kind of justification I have identified.\n4.3 Redundancy-Justification\nWe call a definition which is justified because it eliminates at least one re-\ndundant condition in an already accepted definition redundancy-justified. A\nredundancy-justified definition can be regarded as providing knowledge since\nit shows that specific conditions in an accepted definition are redundant.\n19It does not. First, their interpretation does not make clear that the matter of concern\nis the existence of a partition satisfying (i) and (ii). Even if this is disregarded, their\ninterpretation applies to more systems than Bernoulli systems, for instance, also for to the\nsystem and the partition \u03b1 discussed in the previous footnote. Here the events constituting\nany entire history of box-occupations are of probability zero. Then Batterman\u2019s and Sklar\u2019s\nclaim about the independence from the entire past history of box-occupations is trivially\ntrue. Correct is: any finite number of events of a specific partition at different times are\nindependent, even though the partition is generating.\n21\nIt is obviously desirable in mathematics to find out whether there are\nany redundant conditions in an already accepted definition. Typically, both\nthe original definition, and the one in which the redundant conditions are\neliminated, each have their own advantages. It depends on the definitions,\nbut the former might be easier to understand or might allow for a more fine-\ngrained analysis; the latter is simpler (in the sense of being more concise),\nand it might be that only the latter is easier to use in proofs, allows for\nnatural generalizations, or suggests important analogies.\nSo when is it better to propound the original definition? And when is it\nbetter to introduce instead the new definition without the redundant condi-\ntions, i.e. when is redundancy-justification a reasonable kind of justification?\nI think the answer depends on the definition and the context in which the\ndefinition is considered. For the purpose of an introductory textbook it might\nbe better to propound the original definition because it is easier to under-\nstand. Conversely, for the purpose of a research article it might be better\ninstead to use the new, concise definition, since it is easier to use in some\nproofs. Furthermore, in many cases it does not seem to matter much whether\nthe original definition or the definition in which the redundant conditions are\neliminated is introduced, so long as the origin of the definition and the re-\ndundant conditions are clearly pointed out.\nAs in the case of proof-generation and condition-justification there is the\ndanger of not understanding that a definition is redundancy-justified and\nclaiming that it captures a valuable preformal idea, when it does not.\nTwo definitions of the list of notions of randomness [cf. section 3] are\nredundancy-justified: the continuous version of a Bernoulli-system, which we\nwill discuss for illustration, and a Kolmogorov-system [Sinai, 1963, pp. 64\u201365;\nUffink, 2006, pp. 94\u201396].\n4.3.1 Continuous-time Bernoulli-system\nWe have seen that Kolmogorov [1958] and Sinai [1959] established that iso-\nmorphic discrete-time Bernoulli-systems have the same Kolmogorov-Sinai\nentropy [cf. subsection 4.1.3]. A decade later Ornstein [1970] proved the\nconverse, i.e. that Bernoulli-systems with equal entropy are isomorphic.\n22\nHaving established that celebrated result, Ornstein became interested\nin finding an analogous definition of a Bernoulli-system for continuous time,\nand he asked whether the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy could be used to classify\nthem too. The most obvious definition of a continuous system (X,\u03a3, \u00b5, Tt)\ndescribing an independent process is that for all t the discrete system (X,\u03a3, \u00b5, Tt)\nis a Bernoulli-system. Ornstein [1973] first introduces this definition of a\ncontinuous Bernoulli-system, and then he shows that there are redundant\nconditions in this definition because it is equivalent to the following defini-\ntion:\nDefinition 7 (X,\u03a3, \u00b5, Tt) is a Bernoulli-system iff the discrete system (X,\u03a3, \u00b5, T1)\nis a Bernoulli-system.\nHence Definition 7 is redundancy-justified because it eliminates redundant\nconditions. In this way it seems to be justified in Ornstein\u2019s [1974, p. 56]\nbook too.20\nAny continuous Bernoulli-system can be normalised such that it has\nKolmogorov-Sinai entropy one. Ornstein [1973] indeed showed that any (and\nonly a) normalised continuous-time Bernoulli-system is isomorphic to a nor-\nmalised continuous-time Bernoulli-system. Later it was proven that some\nNewtonian systems are Bernoulli, showing how random Newtonian systems\ncan be [Ornstein, 1989, p. 183].\n4.4 Occurrence of the Kinds of Justification\nTo sum up: in addition to Lakatos\u2019s proof-generated definitions, I have iden-\ntified three kinds of justification of definitions. To my knowledge, condition-\njustification and redundancy-justification have not been identified before. I\ndo not claim that the kinds of justification we have discussed are the only\nones at work in mathematics. Further studies might unveil yet other ones.\n20Ornstein [1974, p. 56] expresses this indirectly by introducing continuous Bernoulli\nsystems as follows; \u2018We will call a flow {(X,\u03a3, \u00b5, Tt)} a {continuous Bernoulli-system}\nif {(X,\u03a3, \u00b5, T1)} is a {Bernoulli system}. (We will prove later that if {(X,\u03a3, \u00b5, T1)} is\na {continuous Bernoulli system}, then {(X,\u03a3, \u00b5, Tt0)]} for each fixed t0 is a {Bernoulli\nsystem}\u2019).\n23\nTwo more general comments about justifying definitions should be added\nhere. First, for any kind of justification there are three possibilities: (i) a\ndefinition is reasonably justified in this way; (ii) it is justified but not reason-\nably justified in this way; (iii) it is not justified in this way. As regards (ii),\nfor instance, if the idea of being equivalent in a measure-theoretic sense to an\nindependent process like throwing a die was not valuable, Definition 2 would\nbe natural-world-justified but not reasonably justified. Second, an already\njustified definition has sometimes additional good features which support this\ndefinition but which do not by themselves constitute a sufficient justification.\nThese features may also be important in deciding between different defini-\ntions. For instance, it is often said that a merit of the Kolmogorov-Sinai en-\ntropy is its neat connection to other notions of randomness like Kolmogorov-\nsystems. These are good features but not sufficient justifications; since if\nthere were no further reasons for studying the definition, there would still be\nthe question why we should regard it as worth considering [cf. Smith, 1998,\npp. 174\u2013175].\nHow widely do the kinds of justification we discussed occur? To answer\nthis, I first comment on the notion of a mathematical subject. I think that\nregardless of which plausible understanding of \u2018subject\u2019 is adopted, my claims\nare true. But a possible way to operationalise this idea is the following: with\nthe subjects identified by the Mathematical Subject Classification21 it would\nbe possible to create a list of subjects of the mathematics from the nineteenth\ncentury up to today. Then with notions of randomness in ergodic theory some\nof the main definitions of the subject \u2018strange attractors, chaotic dynamics\u2019\nhave been investigated.\nBased on my knowledge of mathematics, I endorse the following three\nclaims about mathematics produced in the twentieth century up to the\npresent day:22 first, proof-generated, condition-justified and redundancy-justified\n21This is a five digits classification scheme of subjects formulated by the American\nMathematical Society; see www.ams.org\/msc. For our purposes subjects concerned with\neducation, history or experimental studies have to be excluded.\n22Starting with the twentieth century is somewhat arbitrary. All the here-discussed\nkinds of justification appear also important in nineteenth century mathematics. Yet older\nmathematics may be significantly different. Hence a close investigation would be necessary\nto identify the role the kinds justification play in older mathematics.\n24\ndefinitions are widespread. More specifically, these kinds of justification are\nall found in the majority of mathematical subjects with explicit definitions.\nSecond, for nearly all mathematical subjects with explicit definitions which\n(among other things) aim at describing or understanding the natural world,\nnatural-world-justified definitions are found. This includes subjects not only\nfrom what is called applied mathematics but also from pure mathematics,\ne.g. measure theory. Third, as in my case study for nearly all mathematical\nsubjects with explicit definitions many different ways of justifying definitions\nare found and are reasonable. Indeed, I would be surprised if one subject\ncould be found where only one kind of justification is important. Clearly, my\ncase study shows that for the subject \u2018strange attractors, chaotic dynamics\u2019\nthese claims hold true.\nFor my case study the argumentation involved in justifying definitions is\ntypically not explicitly stated but is merely hinted at or merely implicit in\nthe mathematics. Because of the conventional style of mathematical writing,\nthis appears to be generally the case in mathematics, as also Lakatos [1976,\npp. 142\u2013144] claimed. As we have seen, awareness of the ways of justifying\ndefinitions is important for understanding mathematics and for preventing\nmistakes. Thus it would be desirable if publications addressed this issue more\nexplicitly. Also, it should be mentioned that detailed knowledge of parts of\nergodic theory is necessary to assess how definitions are justified in my case\nstudy. This confirms Tappenden\u2019s claim that judgments about definitions\nrequire detailed knowledge of the relevant mathematics [cf. section 2].\nLet us reflect on the interrelationships between the kinds of justification,\nan issue which seems not discussed in the literature.\n5 Interrelationships Between the Kinds of Jus-\ntification\nIn what follows when we speak of an argument for a definition we mean that\na reason is provided for a definition which cannot be split into two separate\nreasons for this definition. Now we first ask about the interrelationships in\none argument : assume that a specific argument establishes that a definition\n25\nis justified according to one kind of justification. Can it be that this argu-\nment implies that the definition is at the same time also justified according\nto another kind of justification? Intuitively, one might think that in an argu-\nment a definition can only be justified according to one kind of justification.\nYet, as we will see, the matter is more complicated. Second, we ask about the\ninterrelationships between the kinds of justification in different arguments : if\ndifferent arguments justify the same definition, what combination of kinds\nof justification do we find? We will discuss these two cases in the next two\nsubsections.\n5.1 One Argument\nClearly, there are arguments where a definition is only proof-justified, natural-\nworld-justified, condition-justified or redundancy-justified. For example, uni-\nform convergence as discussed by Lakatos [1976, pp. 131\u2013133] is only proof-\njustified, Definition 2 of a Bernoulli-system as capturing the idea of a measure-\ntheoretic system being equivalent to an independent process is only natural-\nworld-justified, weak mixing as corresponding to ergodicity of the compos-\nite system is only condition-justified, and Definition 7 of a continuous-time\nBernoulli system as eliminating redundant conditions is only redundancy-\njustified.\nBy going back to the characterisation of the kinds of justification, we\nsee that the intuition that in an argument a definition can only be (reason-\nably) justified according to one kind of justification is correct except for one\ncase. Namely, in rare cases condition-justified definitions are at the same\ntime proof-generated in an argument. This is so if and only if the kind of\nequivalence is regarded as natural because it occurs in the formulation of a\nconjecture that should be established. For example, assume the following\nconjecture is regarded as valuable: each function in a convergent sequence\nof functions is continuous if and only if the limit function of the convergent\nsequence is continuous. Further, assume that sequences of pointwise con-\nvergent continuous functions without continuous limit functions are known.\nThen mathematicians might ask: how has the notion of convergence to be\nchanged such that if and only if the limit function is continuous the sequence\n26\nof continuous functions is convergent? The definition answering this question\nwould be clearly condition-justified. But it would also be proof-generated\nsince it is needed in order to prove the above conjecture.\nLet us now turn to the interrelationships in different arguments.\n5.2 Different Arguments\nIn our case study different arguments establish that weak mixing is condition-\njustified: weak mixing corresponds to ergodicity of the composite system, to\nthe set-theoretic or integral-theoretic condition equivalent to having a con-\ntinuous spectrum, and for continuous systems to the condition that for all\nt the transformation T t is ergodic. Generally, one and the same definition\ncan be (reasonably) justified in the same way in different arguments by re-\nferring to different conjectures, preformal ideas etc. For proof-generation\nLakatos [1976, pp. 127\u2013128] recognises this pattern.\nWhat is more, we have seen that in different arguments Definition 1\nof weak mixing is justified in different ways: as mentioned above, it is\ncondition-justified but also natural-world-justified, expressing the idea that\nalmost all sufficiently past events are approximately independent. Likewise,\nthe Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy is natural-world-justified, expressing the idea\nof the highest average amount of information produced per step relative\nto a coding; but it is also proof-generated concerning the conjecture that\nspectrally-isomorphic systems are not always isomorphic. Generally, one\nand the same definition can in different arguments be (reasonably) justified\nin different ways.\nFinally, a definition which is justified in any way can be used to (rea-\nsonably) justify a definition in an arbitrary way. In this sense the different\nkinds of justification are closely connected. For example, the natural-world-\njustified Definition 2 of a Bernoulli-system is used to justify the condition-\njustified Definition 6 of a Bernoulli-system.\nA special case of this is when for proof-generated definitions preformal-\nideas shine through (which can be, but does not have to be the case). For\ninstance, consider definitions of polyhedron as discussed by Lakatos [1976].\nEarly definitions of polyhedron, which seem to be justified because they cap-\n27\nture the preformal idea of a solid with plane faces and straight edges, were\neventually replaced by definitions which are needed to prove the Euler con-\njecture. For these proof-generated definitions, to some extent, the preformal\nidea of the old definitions still shine through. Hence Lakatos\u2019s [1976, p. 90]\nclaim \u201cIn the different proof-generated theorems we have nothing of the naive\nconcept\u201d is an unfortunate exaggeration.\nWe now return to Lakatos\u2019s ideas on justifying definitions.\n6 Assessment of Lakatos\u2019s Ideas on Proof-\nGenerated Definitions\nFirst, in focusing on proof-generated definitions, Lakatos fails to recognise the\ninterplay between the different kinds of justification of definitions, which we\ndiscussed in section 5. In particular, Lakatos never indicates that in different\narguments the same definition can be justified in different ways.\nSecond, Lakatos fails to show, as we did for notions of randomness in\nergodic theory, that often various kinds of justification can be found and that\na variety of kinds of justification can be reasonable. We argued that Lakatos\nmay have believed the following [cf. section 2]: there are many mathemati-\ncal subjects where proof-generation should be the sole important way that\ndefinitions are justified; and there are many subjects after the discovery of\nproof-generation where proof-generation is the sole important way that defi-\nnitions are justified. From our claim that for nearly all mathematical subjects\nmany different ways of justifying definitions are found and are reasonable fol-\nlows that this must be wrong [cf. section 4.4]. That is, subjects created after\nthe discovery of proof-generation where solely proof-generated definitions are\nfound and are reasonable appear to be exceptional.\nIndeed, Lakatos could have shown with his case studies that often various\nkinds of justification are found and that various kinds of justification can be\nreasonable. To demonstrate this, I will now show that even for the subjects\ndiscussed by Lakatos [1976] not only proof-generation but also other kinds\nof justification are important. Because of lack of space, I show this here\nonly for the subjects to which the definition of uniform convergence and the\n28\nCarathe\u00b4odory definition of measurable sets belong. But this hypothesis can\neasily seen to be also true for the subjects to which the other proof-justified\ndefinitions Lakatos discusses (namely polyhedron, bounded variation and the\nRiemann integral) belong.\nLakatos [1976, pp. 144\u2013146] argues that uniform convergence is proof-\ngenerated, also by referring to textbooks. This definition falls under the\nsubject \u2018convergence and divergence of series and sequences of functions\u2019.23\nA definition discussed in this subject is the radius of convergence of a power\nseries. A power series is of the form\n\u2211\u221e\nk=0 ak(x\u2212 x0)k, where ak \u2208 R.\nDefinition 8 Its radius of convergence is the unique number R \u2208 [0,\u221e] such\nthat the series converges absolutely if |x\u2212x0| < R and diverges if |x\u2212x0| > R.\nThe radius of convergence is often defined differently as follows. The root\ntest is a powerful criterion for the convergence of infinite series. Hence the\nquestion arises whether there is a definition which is equivalent to the radius\nof convergence as defined above but which gives an explicit way to calculate\nthis radius by referring to the root test. The answer is yes, namely:\nDefinition 9 For a power series the radius of convergence is\nR := 1\/ lim sup\nk\u2192\u221e\nk\n\u221a\n|ak|.\nThus Definition 9 is condition-justified, as, for example, hinted at in Marsden\nand Hoffman\u2019s [1974, pp. 289\u2013290] standard analysis book: \u201cThe reason for\nthe terminology in {Definition 9} is brought out by the following result [that\nby applying the root test, Definition 9 is equivalent to Definition 8].\u201d\nLakatos [1976, pp. 152\u2013154], mainly by referring to Halmos\u2019s [1950] book,\nargues that the Carathe\u00b4odory definition of measurable sets is proof-generated.\nThis definition falls under the subject \u2018classes of sets in measure theory.24 The\ndefinition of a \u03c3-algebra clearly belongs to this subject. The basic idea of a\n\u03c3-algebra is to have a collection of subsets of X including X which is closed\nunder countable set-theoretic operations. Thus a usual definition is [Cohn,\n1980, pp. 1\u20132]:\n23In the terms of the Mathematical Subject Classification.\n24\u2018Classes of sets, measurable sets, Suslin sets, analytic sets\u2019 in the terms of the Math-\nematical Subject Classification.\n29\nDefinition 10 A set \u03a3 of subsets of X is a \u03c3-algebra iff\n(i) X \u2208 \u03a3,\n(ii) for all A \u2286 X if A \u2208 \u03a3, then X \\ A \u2208 \u03a3,\n(iii) for all sequences (Ak)k\u22650 if Ak \u2208 \u03a3 for all k \u2265 0, then\n\u22c3\u221e\ni=0Ak\u2208\u03a3,\n(iv) for all sequences (Ak)k\u22650 if Ak \u2208 \u03a3 for all k \u2265 0, then\n\u22c2\u221e\ni=0Ak\u2208\u03a3.\nNow one can easily see that the conditions (i), (ii) and (iii) imply (iv). Conse-\nquently, many use the following definition because it eliminates a redundant\ncondition.\nDefinition 11 A set \u03a3 of subsets of a set X is a \u03c3-algebra iff (i), (ii) and\n(iii) hold.\nClearly, it is redundancy-justified as, for instance, in Ash\u2019s [1972, p. 4] stan-\ndard book on measure theory.\nTo conclude, even for the subjects discussed by Lakatos various kinds of\njustification are found and are reasonable.\n7 Conclusion\nThis paper addressed the actual practice of how definitions in mathematics\nare justified in articles and books and whether the justification is reasonable.\nIn section 2 I discussed the main account of these issues, namely Lakatos\u2019s\nideas on proof-generated definitions. While important, this paper showed\nhow they are limited. My assessment of Lakatos and my thoughts on jus-\ntifying definitions are based on a case study of notions of randomness in\nergodic theory, which was introduced in section 3. In section 4 I identified\nthree other important and common ways of justifying definitions: natural-\nworld-justification, condition-justification and redundancy-justification. To\nmy knowledge, condition-justification and redundancy-justification have not\nbeen discussed so far. Also, we have seen that awareness of the ways def-\ninitions are justified is important for mathematical understanding and for\navoiding mistakes. Then in section 5 I discussed the interrelationships be-\ntween the different kinds of justification of definitions, an issue which has not\nbeen addressed before. In particular, I argued that in different arguments\n30\nthe same definition can be justified in different ways. Finally, in section 6 I\ncriticised Lakatos\u2019s ideas on proof-generated definitions. They fails to recog-\nnise the interplay between the kinds of justification. Furthermore, they fail\nto show that often various kinds of justification are found and that a variety\nof kinds of justification can be reasonable.\nAcknowledgments.\nI am indebted to Jeremy Butterfield and Peter Smith for valuable feedback\non previous versions of this manuscript.
