It arises as \na response to three propositions made by J. Gordon Melton in this issue. The first of these \nis that NRMs have more in common with their religious traditions of origin than with each \nother. The second is that NRM is a residual category\uf8e7it is not a church, a sect or an ethnic \nreligion. Melton\u2019s third proposal is that NRMs might best be defined as religions that are \ngreeted with antagonism by significant elements of the wider society, including traditional \nreligions. My response is, first, that however related or unrelated they are to their \nrespective traditions, NRMs are likely to share certain characteristics with each other \nmerely because they are new. Second, these characteristics are deserving of attention in \ntheir own right and cannot be reduced to their not being various types of other religions. \nThird, rather than being used as a defining characteristic, the antagonism with which \nNRMs are met can be more usefully thought of as a consequence of their newness. \n \n \nNova Religio is, its name suggests, a journal that is written by and for those who are interested \nin new religions. It is true that its subtitle (The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions) \nand the initial introduction to the journal make it clear that it has always been intended that new \nreligions should be broadly defined.1 But this does not detract from the contention of this article, \nwhich, basically, takes issue with the implication in J. Gordon Melton\u2019s article, \u201cToward a \nDefinition of \u2018New Religion\u2019\u201d (this issue), that the \u201cnew\u201d of new religious movements (NRMs) \nis irrelevant to our understanding of what it is that we are studying. My argument is that it is the \nvery fact that NRMs are new that explains many of the key characteristics they display. If we \nignore their newness we are in danger not only of not recognizing the existence of such \ncharacteristics, but also of not understanding the ways in which the movements function \n(including how and why they undergo such radical changes within a short period from their \ninception), and the ways in which the wider society reacts to their existence. \nI would, however, like to stress from the start that although I am in some ways contesting the \nposition Melton adopts in his article, it is not that I think he is ill informed or wrong in his \napproach. On the contrary, few scholars know more about old and new religions than he does, \nand I have long had the greatest respect for his scholarship. However, while I am a sociologist of \nreligion, Melton describes himself as an American religious historian, and he has both a Master \nof Divinity degree in Church History and a Ph.D. in the History and Literature of Religion; and \n                                                 \n1 Phillip C. Lucas, \u201cIntroduction, Acknowledgements and Announcements,\u201d Nova Religio 1, no. 1 (October 1997): \n6-9. \nalthough our interests certainly overlap, they draw us in somewhat different directions\uf8e7we ask \nsomewhat different questions, use somewhat different approaches and are interested in somewhat \ndifferent aspects of religion. I believe (and I suspect Melton would share this belief) that the \ndifferences between us can enrich rather than impoverish our knowledge. What follows is, thus, \nintended to complement rather than contradict his position. \n \nDEFINITIONS \n \nBefore proceeding with my argument, it might be helpful to make a few points about the role \nof definitions in order to underline the fact that those we use tend both to reflect and to promote \nour interests. Definitions allow us to identify phenomena so that we can communicate about \nthem. They isolate a characteristic or cluster of characteristics and, thereby, exclude other \ncharacteristics from the label we employ. Furthermore, those characteristics we have selected \nenable us to discover what other characteristics are likely to be associated with the phenomenon \nin question. The boundary that defines something (be it an object, an act or a religion) is a human \ncreation, not a Platonic truth. The way that boundary is drawn can alert us to some features but, \nin so doing, it can blind us to others. Although it can lead to confusion if we are not explicit \nabout what we are doing, there is no need to stick to one definition\uf8e7for some purposes a \nsubstantive definition but for other purposes a functional definition of religion can be useful.2 \nOne of the most important distinctions between definitions is that between reportive and \nstipulative definitions.3 When social scientists present a reportive definition they are claiming \nthat this is the way in which the word is used by the population they are studying\uf8e7thus: \u201cBy \n\u2018cult\u2019 the media mean \u2018a bad religion.\u2019\u201d This statement is more or less true. When, however, \nsocial scientists produce a stipulative definition they are clarifying what they themselves mean \nby the term\uf8e7thus: \u201cThe term \u2018cult\u2019 will be used to refer to a religion with a charismatic leader.\u201d \nThis statement is not making a claim that is true or false; the definition is, rather, more or less \nuseful as a descriptive and\/or analytical tool. \nClearly a stipulative definition cannot by itself tell us what the world is actually like; what the \ndefinition includes and what it excludes is the result of nothing more than the stipulator\u2019s \ndecision. It is a label that has been placed on a phenomenon to identify it according to a \nparticular characteristic or variable (such as having a charismatic leader, or, alternatively, as \nhaving a first-generation membership), thereby enabling us to see what other characteristics or \nvariables are or are not as a matter of fact related in one way or another with that phenomenon. If \n\u201ccult\u201d is defined as a religion with a charismatic leader, it would be impossible to find a cult \nwithout a charismatic leader for it would not then be a cult. If, on the other hand, \u201ccult\u201d had been \nstipulatively defined as \u201ca religion with an apocalyptic worldview,\u201d it would then be possible to \ndiscover that, say, the majority of cults (religions with apocalyptic worldviews) have (or do not \nhave) a charismatic leader.4 \n                                                 \n2 A functional definition is based on what a religion does for an individual or group (such as providing meaning), \nwhilst a substantive definition is based on what the religion is (such as a set of beliefs about superhuman beings). \nSee Meredith B. McGuire, Religion: The Social Context, 5th ed. (Belmont, Cal.: Wadsworth, 2002), 8-13. \n3 For a fuller discussion about these distinctions, see John Hospers, An Introduction to Philosophical Analysis, 3rd \ned. (London: Routledge, 1990), 116-19. \n4 This distinction between definition and discovery is similar to the philosophical distinction between analytical \nstatements, in which the relationship between the subject and the predicate is necessary, and synthetic statements in \nwhich the relationship is contingent. \nObviously enough, the larger the number of characteristics included in a definition, the less \nopportunity there is to make claims about what is actually going on \u201cout there.\u201d For this reason, \nit is often useful to concentrate on one defining characteristic, and then investigate what, if any, \nrelationship phenomena with this characteristic have with other variables. But it is important to \nbe aware that the defining characteristic(s) that are selected will influence the questions we ask \nand, perhaps more importantly, the questions we do not ask. Thus, asking questions about \ncharacteristics one might expect to find in religions that \u201chave been assigned an outsider status \nby the dominant religious culture and then by elements within the secular culture,\u201d as Melton \nrecommends, will produce a different, though possibly overlapping, set of answers from asking \nquestions about the characteristics of religions made up of first-generation converts, as I shall \nrecommend. \n \nTRADITION AND\/OR NOVELTY \n \nAn explanation that draws on the concept of tradition usually involves a claim that the \nphenomenon in question now exists because it has been handed down from the past. Just as \nreportive and stipulative definitions are not the same thing, so explanations offered by \npractitioners or believers are not necessarily the same as those offered by scholars. Indeed, \nscholars may be skeptical about the extent to which a particular belief or practice was practiced \nor believed in the past, and they frequently note the selective nature in which some \nbeliefs\/practices are taken up while others are forgotten. There are, furthermore, plenty of \ninstances when, despite claims to the contrary, so-called religious traditions owe far more to a \nculture than to any original tenets or doctrines. Not only is change a more or less constant feature \nwithin any religious tradition, there is also the tradition of inventing tradition.5 \nIt would, of course, be ridiculous to deny that the beliefs and practices of NRMs will owe at \nleast something to the religious traditions from which they emerge\uf8e7movements that have \nevolved from Eastern traditions are, for example, likely to believe in reincarnation, while those \nfrom Christian traditions are more likely to be preoccupied with salvation involving the \nresurrection of the body. Melton, however, tells us that the new religions he wanted to classify in \nhis world-renowned Encyclopedia of American Religions \u201ctended to resemble their parent group \nfar more than each other.\u201d  \nMaybe. Yet I know of no unit of measurement that would allow us to make scientific \ncomparisons for similarities and differences between parent and peer religions without risking \nthe selection of a question-begging criterion of analysis. I suspect that by looking at an NRM \nthrough the glasses of an historian of religions one might more readily focus on the beliefs and, \nperhaps, the institutional claims of both old and new religions, whereas employing the glasses of \na social scientist might encourage one to concentrate more on the actions of believers, their life \nstyle, leadership patterns and organization.  \nTo repeat, I do not wish to deny for one instant that locating an NRM in its tradition is a \nuseful, even an essential part of our understanding of the movement. But there are, nonetheless, \nways in which the movements differ radically from their co-traditionalists, while sharing aspects \nof their beliefs and (more obviously) their practices with each other and with other NRMs from \nother traditions. First, there are the differences within any one tradition and the large number of \noverlaps between traditions. The fact that many NRMs are syncretistic adds to the complexity. \n                                                 \n5 See Michael A. Williams, Collett Cox and Martin S. Jaffe, eds. Innovation in Religious Traditions: Essays in the \nInterpretation of Religious Change (Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter, 1992).  \nWe can, for example, find Theosophists embracing both reincarnation and resurrection. The very \nfact that a new religion has emerged is likely to mean that at least some beliefs differ (sometimes \nonly in emphasis, but often quite radically) from the mainstream tradition. There are, \nfurthermore, NRMs that it would be hard to fit into any recognizable tradition. Melton mentions \nthe Church of Scientology, and there are, for example, various assortments of contemporary \nUFO groups that may or may not owe something to an esoteric tradition or to Christianity\uf8e7and \nwhile the growing number of \u201cvirtual religions\u201d may owe something to diverse traditions \n(religious and secular), innovations related to the medium can render them well-nigh \nunrecognizable to mainstream traditionalists. \nBut my argument does not rest on the problems of relating NRMs to a parent group; more \npositively, I want to suggest that there is a significant amount (although obviously not \neverything) that NRMs may hold in common, and that this can be traced to their newness. In \nother words, the International Society of Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), the Brahma \nKumaris and Ananda Marga certainly share Hindu roots, just as the Twelve Tribes, the Jesus \nArmy and The Family can claim Christian roots, but the very fact that they can all be called new \nreligious movements should alert us to the fact that they might also share certain characteristics \nwith each other. \n \nBEING NEW \n \nIt can be claimed that there is a sense in which nothing is new; nothing is ever completely ex \nnihilo if only because it will be constructed by socialized human beings and it will encompass, at \nleast in part, some pre-existing components. It can equally well be claimed that there is another \nsense in which everything is new; social reality is an on-going process that is mediated through \nindividuals who bring new perspectives and understandings as they continually recreate even the \noldest of traditions.6 However, while it may be necessary to be aware of these truisms they will \nnot by themselves get us very far in understanding the newness of new religions. We need to ask: \n\u201cIn what ways are NRMs new and in what ways are they traditional?\u201d \n \nNew Combinations \n \nNewness implies change\uf8e7difference from what was \u201cthere\u201d before\uf8e7but what makes the \ndifference might have been somewhere before. Most obviously, an NRM may be new within a \nparticular tradition, involving some sort of innovation or novel interpretation of an ancient rite \nor Scripture, such as the Children of God\u2019s radical interpretation of the \u201cLaw of Love.\u201d7 But this \nis by no means the only kind of innovation one finds. \nSometimes, because it consists of a new combination of pre-existing beliefs from two or more \nancient traditions (such as one finds in Unification Church theology in the Divine Principle), a \nmovement is considered to be not \u201creally\u201d new. This, however, could be to commit the fallacy of \nassuming that two olds make an old, which is not necessarily true. Just as water (H20) has \n                                                 \n6 Peter L. Berger and Thomas Luckmann, The Social Construction of Reality: Everything that Passes for Knowledge \nin Society (London: Allen Lane, 1967). \n7 This involved the widely publicized practice of \u201cflirty fishing\u201d between the mid-1970s and mid-1980s. See J. \nGordon Melton, \u201cSexuality and the Maturation of The Family,\u201d in Sex, Slander, and Salvation: Investigating The \nFamily\/Children of God, ed. James R. Lewis and J. Gordon Melton (Stanford: Center for Academic Publications, \n1994), 71-95. \ndifferent properties from those of either hydrogen (H) or oxygen (O2) in gaseous form\uf8e7and, \nindeed, from hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which is made up from a different combination of the \nsame two elements\uf8e7so can syncretistic combinations of religious traditions have unique, \nemergent properties. On the other hand, a combination of two erstwhile separate religious groups \ndoes not necessarily lead to radically new characteristics. Take, for example, the creation of the \nUnited Reformed Church in 1972 through the union of the Congregational Church in England \nand Wales and the Presbyterian Church of England. In this instance there were no radical \nchanges in beliefs or practices, and members of the congregations went on believing and \npracticing pretty well as they had done before. To extend my analogy, it was as if the elements of \noxygen and hydrogen had been mixed together, rather than combined into a new compound. \n \nNew Locations and Structures \n \nAs Melton points out, religions may be new to a particular society although they had thrived \nfor centuries, even millennia, in another society. This is clearly the case with many of the \nreligions that have traveled with immigrants or been introduced by missionaries from one part of \nthe world to another, whether it is Shinto in Brazil, Hinduism in Pennsylvania, Zoroastrianism in \nEngland, or Christianity in parts of nineteenth-century Africa. This might or might not give rise \nto antagonistic reactions from the host society (see below). \nAlternatively (or concurrently) the institutional organization of a religion may be new. A \nmovement such as ISKCON objects strongly to being called an NRM, pointing out that when His \nDivine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada (who, interestingly, is referred to as the \nFounder-acharya [teacher] of ISKCON on the official website and elsewhere) came to the West \nhe brought with him a centuries-old tradition that traces its lineage back through the sixteenth-\ncentury saint, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, to the teachings of the Bhagavad-Gita\uf8e7in fact, it has been \nclaimed that ISKCON\u2019s tradition has no beginning as Vedic civilization existed from at least the \nstart of recorded history.8 Those who classify ISKCON as an NRM will, however, argue that it \ntook a fundamentally new form when it was established in 1966, and, as a result, displayed \nfundamentally new features.9 \nA further complication arises when one looks at the membership of ISKCON. In the early \ndays of the movement the devotees were nearly all young and white, and often drawn from the \nhippie culture. Today, the vast majority of worshippers and attendees at festivals in the West are \nof first, second or even third-generation Asian descent. In Britain, these immigrants and their \nfamilies (just like Indian disciples of Sathya Sai Baba) are not considered by themselves or by \nmost Britons to be members of a new religion, while devotees from white families are. \n \nNew Members  \n \nThus far it has been suggested that \u201cnewness\u201d can apply to various aspects of NRMs, such as \ntheir beliefs, practices, organization and\/or geographical or social location. This kind of \n                                                 \n8 Mukunda Goswami, \u201cNRM Is a Four-Letter Word: The Language of Oppression,\u201d ISKCON Communications \nJournal 3 no. 2 (1995): 75. \n9 Interestingly, the anthropologist Charles Brooks, who studied the growth of the movement not in the West, but in \nVrindaban (where, Hindus believe, Krishna played as a child some 5,000 or more years ago), uses Anthony F. C. \nWallace\u2019s term \u201crevitalization movement\u201d to describe ISKCON. Charles R. Brooks, The Hare Krishnas in India \n(Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1989), 72-3. \ncomplexity might lead some to say the label of \u201cnew\u201d is too messy to be of any use. However, \none might equally well argue that it is because we use the concept \u201cnew\u201d that we are forced to \nunpack such important differences between pertinent applications of newness.  \nBut it is newness of membership that I want to concentrate on for most of the remainder of \nthis essay. What, I want to ask, are some of the questions we could be encouraged to address \nwhen we start from a definition of NRMs as religions consisting predominantly of first-\ngeneration members? Or, to put it another way: What characteristics are more likely to be \nassociated with a religion comprised of first-generation converts, than with a religion comprised \nof people born and raised within it? \nOf course, few if any characteristics will always be present, and several will not be exclusive \nto NRMs. Anyone who has studied them would agree that to generalize about NRMs is a \ndecidedly risky exercise; they differ from each other in almost every conceivable way. There are, \nnonetheless, some variables that do have a tendency to be associated with first-generation \nreligions wherever and whenever they have emerged, be it early Christianity, Islam, Oomoto, \nSubud, Unarius or Scientology. And, of course, to start with a first-generation orientation \ntowards NRMs does not mean that we cannot ask what happens when the second and subsequent \ngenerations appear on the scene, or when there is a mixture of both converts and members who \nwere born into the movement. On the contrary, these are some of the very questions promoted by \nsuch a perspective. \n \nConverts, Boundaries and Dichotomies \n \nConverts, having decided to accept a new faith (be it an old or new religion) rather than \ncontinuing in the one into which they were born and\/or which is the norm in their society or \nsubculture, tend to be considerably more enthusiastic about their new beliefs and practices than \nthose brought up in their religion.10 Furthermore, converts frequently want to share their newly \nfound Truths and will engage in zealous proselytism, especially with relatives and friends. In \nmany respects they exhibit the characteristics that Bryan Wilson lists under the general heading \nof \u201cvoluntariness\u201d;11 they have made a commitment, they take their religion seriously\uf8e7they \ncare. \nAt the same time, converts tend to be more vulnerable than \u201cborn into\u201d members. They are \nunlikely to have internalized their new faith to the extent those raised in their religion will have \ninternalized it. Conversion involves secondary socialization. Under such conditions, information \nand arguments from non-members can challenge faith and raise doubts\uf8e7the more they learn, the \ngreater the possibility they may discover facets of the religion that do not fit the image to which \nthey had originally been attracted. This means that converts may need to be protected from \noutside influences that could undermine their new faith, and not infrequently NRMs will erect \nsocial and\/or geographical boundaries to keep their members \u201cseparate.\u201d Alternative ideas and \nquestioning may be discouraged, and the movement\u2019s position will be laid out unambiguously, \nfree from qualifications or shades of grey that could lead to confusion. Thus, while the content of \n                                                 \n10 I do not want to enter the brainwashing\/mind control debate, although thirty years of studying several of those \nNRMs that have most frequently been accused of employing brainwashing techniques have persuaded me that those \nwho use such terms tend to be concerned about the content of the beliefs and practices that the convert adopts, rather \nthan the methods by which the convert arrives at those beliefs. See Eileen Barker The Making of a Moonie: \nBrainwashing or Choice? (Oxford: Blackwell, 1984). \n11 Bryan Wilson, Religious Sects: A Sociological Study (London: Weidenfeld & Nicholson, 1970), 28. \nbeliefs may differ radically between NRMs, the ways in which they are portrayed and the \nintensity with which they are held may display some resemblance. \nA related tendency one finds in many NRMs (even in some of those that promote holism) is a \ndichotomous worldview in which beliefs are seen as true or false; people as good or bad; actions \nas right or wrong\uf8e7with all three (beliefs, people and actions) being defined as godly or satanic. \nAn individual\u2019s identity is defined primarily according to whether s\/he is or is not a member of \nthe NRM, with any other role or status being of secondary importance. The sharp division \nbetween \u201cthem\u201d and \u201cus\u201d is not easily permeated, and to cross the boundary can be seen as both \ntreason and heresy\uf8e7not only a betrayal of God, the leader and one\u2019s friends, but also a \ndangerous and possibly satanic act that can result in severe and terrible repercussions.12 Time \nalso can be seen in terms of sharp divisions between the \u201cnow\u201d and a \u201cthen\u201d (which can be past \nor future)\uf8e7there was the time before conversion when, in all likelihood, the converts now \nremember themselves as miserable sinners; and the time after conversion when the converts were \nborn again and started to lead a \u201cnew life.\u201d There may also be the expectation of a dramatic \nchange in the future, which could be welcomed or feared as the New Age or the battle of \nArmageddon. \n \nAtypical Membership \n \nNRMs do not appeal to converts equally across the demographic spectrum. Each one is likely \nto attract certain types of people but to repel, or at least hold little attraction, for others. There \nhave been times and places throughout history when new religions have appealed to the poor and \nthe oppressed.13 The wave of NRMs that hit the headlines in the West in the 1960s and 1970s \nattracted a membership that consisted disproportionately of young, white adults from the better \neducated classes, although there were exceptions, such as the Rastafarians that have attracted \nblack unemployed youth, and some of the human potential movements, which have drawn a \nslightly older, fee-paying clientele. \nThis characteristic of disproportionate appeal can result in a variety of related characteristics. \nIf, for example, an NRM has a membership consisting predominantly of young, well-educated \nconverts, it is likely to follow that the membership will be: (a) healthier than the general \npopulation; (b) unencumbered by dependents\uf8e7be these young or old; and (c) enthusiastic but \ninexperienced. These three characteristics alone can explain a not inconsiderable amount of the \npotential and limitations of such a movement. Similarly, movements consisting of a \ndisproportionate number of the dispossessed are likely to have little status, money or power. In \nother words, recognition of the fact that the membership is unlikely to reflect the general \npopulation can alert us to look for its peculiarities and thus be aware of some of the \nconsequences of these for the movement and its relations with the rest of society. \n \nCharismatic Authority \n                                                 \n12 Here social control is promoted by means of a strong \u201cgroup\u201d structure as defined by Mary Douglas, Natural \nSymbols: Explorations in Cosmology (London: Barrie & Rockliff, 1970). It should, however, be pointed out that this \ndoes not apply to all NRMs, but is most commonly a feature in those that Wallis, following Weber, termed \u201cworld-\nrejecting movements.\u201d Roy Wallis, The Elementary Forms of the New Religious Life (London: Routledge & Kegan \nPaul, 1984), 9ff. \n13 See, for example, Vittorio Lanternari, The Religions of the Oppressed: A Study of Modern Messianic Cults \n(London: MacGibbon & Kee, 1963). \n \nInsofar as an NRM is new in the sense that it consists primarily of converts, it is unlikely to \nhave been formed by a committee or democratically organized group. There is likely to be a \nleader who is considered to have some new revelation or insight. This may well (though does not \nalways) result in his or her wielding charismatic authority in the Weberian sense. The authority \nmay be accorded to the leader by the followers as much as it is a characteristic of the leader,14 \nbut, for whatever reason, the end result is that the leader is seen to embody what the followers \nconsider to be a legitimate right to tell them how to live all aspects of their lives, and to change \nthis at a moment\u2019s notice. Such leadership is not bound by tradition\uf8e7the movement has no \ntradition (although it may employ a rhetoric that appeals to the leader\u2019s depiction of a timeless \ntradition); and it has no rules\uf8e7or, rather, no established rules beyond those that the leader makes \nand breaks. To the degree that authority in the NRM is charismatic, the leadership will \ndemonstrate neither predictability nor accountability. As a point of comparison, movements that \nare new because they have moved to a new location or because they have come together (as with \nthe United Reformed Church) are unlikely to have a charismatic leadership and are more likely \nto rely on traditional or rational-legal authority. Schisms, however, frequently do have some sort \nof charismatic leadership, as was the case with the Branch Davidians or with several of the \nsplinter groups that have broken away from the Worldwide Church of God. \n \nExternal Antagonism \n \nGiven that new religions are offering an alternative to the status quo, it is not surprising that \nthey are frequently greeted with ignorance, suspicion, fear, and hostility\uf8e7even when they have \nnot offended against any law or, indeed, done anything that would be considered harmful were it \nperformed in a traditional religion.15 There is an abundance of evidence that NRMs have been \nand continue to be discriminated against disproportionately on account of their being new. \n\u201cOrdinary people\u201d are prone to suspect that the new beliefs and practices pose a danger to \nindividuals and their families, and, perhaps, will undermine the very fabric of society.16 Such an \nattitude is quite likely to reinforce and be reinforced by negative perceptions of several of the \ncharacteristics mentioned earlier\uf8e7converts adopting \u201cincredible\u201d beliefs, indulging in unusual \n\u201cabnormal\u201d\/\u201cunnatural\u201d practices and lifestyles; 17  cutting themselves off socially if not \ngeographically from the rest of the world (apart from procuring new members and money); \n                                                 \n14  Eileen Barker, \u201cCharismatization: The Social Production of \u2018an Ethos Propitious to the Mobilization of \nSentiments,\u2019\u201d in Secularization, Rationalism and Sectarianism, ed. Eileen Barker, James Beckford and Karel \nDobbelaere (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1993), 81-202. \n15 The chapters in David G. Bromley and J. Gordon Melton, eds., Cults, Religion and Violence (Cambridge: \nCambridge University Press, 2002) repeatedly point out that the vast majority of NRMs do not indulge in criminal \nbehavior. Clearly there are exceptions, Aum Shinriky\u00f4 and the Solar Temple being two of the widely publicized \nexamples. Of course, members of traditional religions have frequently fallen afoul of the law, the thousands of \nallegations of child abuse brought against clergy provide but one topical example. \n16 I discuss some of the ways in which NRMs are discriminated against because they are new in Eileen Barker, \n\u201cWhy the Cults? New Religions and Freedom of Religion and Beliefs,\u201d in Facilitating Freedom of Religion and \nBelief: Perspectives, Impulses and Recommendations from the Oslo Coalition, ed. Tore Lindholm, Bahiyyih Tahzib-\nLie and Cole Durham (Dordecht Netherlands: Kluwer, 2004), forthcoming. \n17 This may be particularly upsetting for middle-class parents who see their \u201cchildren\u201d abandoning the lifestyle that \nthey (the parents) had fought for them to enjoy. \nunquestioningly following a leader who ignores and\/or denounces the rules and traditions of \n\u201cnormal\u201d society\uf8e7and so on. \nThe extent to which hostilities are played out in the relationship between the NRM and the \nhost society varies from NRM to NRM and from society to society, and antagonism toward the \nmovements is by no means evenly spread throughout society. It is certainly true that, as Melton \npoints out, some traditional religions oppose new religions quite forcefully\uf8e7sometimes with \nviolence; but other traditional religions, while not agreeing with the new beliefs, are prepared to \ntolerate or even cautiously celebrate the diversity in their midst.18 Furthermore, it should be \nstressed that not all NRMs are visible to the public\uf8e7some Gurdjieff groups, for example, are \nincredibly difficult to track down and there are hundreds of other NRMs that few, apart from the \nmembers, their relatives and friends, are likely to have heard of. It tends to be the concept of a \nnew religion that causes antagonism rather than the thousands of NRMs that actually exist, with \nthe media constantly reinforcing an association with the dozen or so atrocities that have hit the \nheadlines (such as Jonestown, the Solar Temple, Aum Shinriky\u00f4 and the Movement for the \nRestoration of the Ten Commandments of God). INFORM has over 3,000 different groups on \nfile, yet in an average year it receives enquiries about fewer than 150 different groups, the vast \nmajority being for information about either a score or so \u201cfavorites\u201d or general categories of \nmovements (such as the New Age or Paganism).19 \n \nChange \n \nA final characteristic I would like to put forward as associated with new religions is that they \nundergo transformations and modifications far more radically and rapidly than the vast majority \nof older religions under normal circumstances.  \nRodney Stark has estimated that \n \n[a]lthough it is impossible to calculate the actual rate of success, probably no more than \none religious movement out of 1,000 will attract more than 100,000 followers and last for \nas long as a century. Even most movements that achieve these modest results will become \nno more than a footnote in the history of religions.20 \n \nWhether or not this is an accurate assessment, it is clear that Stark is correct in pointing out \nthat most NRMs have been little more than one or two-generation movements. This is not the \n                                                 \n18 Although individual members of the Anglican communion have expressed antagonism, some even leading anticult \nand countercult groups, the Church of England as an institution has not expressed antagonism but has supported the \ndissemination of an academic approach to understanding NRMs. See Eileen Barker \u201cINFORM: Bringing the \nSociology of Religion to the Public Space,\u201d in Frontier Religions in Public Space, ed. Pauline C\u00f4t\u00e9 (Ottawa: \nUniversity of Ottawa Press, 2001), 21-34. For an example of further Anglican support for other faiths, see James \nBeckford and Sophie Gilliat, Religion in Prison: Equal Rites in a Multi-Faith Society (Cambridge: Cambridge \nUniversity Press, 1988).  \nIt might, however, be noted en passant that the Church of England was responsible for the bloody persecution of \nother faiths, most notably Catholicism, when it was relatively new, having been established, disestablished and re-\nestablished by kings and queens during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. \n19 INFORM is a registered charity that I founded in 1988 with the objective of providing information which is as \nbalanced and up-to-date as possible about NRMs. It is based at the London School of Economics and receives \nsupport from the British government and mainstream Churches. See <http:\/\/www.inform.ac\/>.  \n20 Rodney Stark, \u201cWhy Religious Movements Succeed or Fail,\u201d Journal of Contemporary Religion 11, no. 2 (1996): \n133. \nplace to discuss the variables that determine why some survive and others do not;21 but survival \nis clearly a legitimate issue for scholars of NRMs to investigate, and, perhaps, one that is more \nlikely to be evoked by a curiosity about newness than about continuing traditions. \nAssuming, however, that a first-generation movement is to survive, it will, necessarily \nundergo a number of changes due to the fact that its newness becomes less new than it was. \nThese changes will originate both internally and externally; some (such as demographic changes) \nwill be inevitable; others will be the result of more or less necessary, and more or less conscious, \ndecisions (such as how to educate children born into the movement and how to deal with them if \nthey rebel). Comparing it to the first-generation movement, the arrival of the second generation \nmight result in what could be termed an \u201cinverted disproportionality,\u201d with a high percentage of \nchildren, very few young adults and a \u201cbulge\u201d of middle-aged members\uf8e7the original converts \nhaving aged, and (as a consequence of devoting resources of time and money to childrearing) \nhaving had relatively little opportunity to attract new members.22 Generally speaking, however, \nthe greater the number of generations a movement is from its beginnings, the less significant the \ndemographic discrepancy between it and the general population is likely to be. Nonetheless, \nminority religions are likely to continue to cater to a \u201cspecialist clientele,\u201d and movements such \nas the Shakers that discourage sexual relations are likely to acquire an ageing profile unless they \nare successful in attracting a steady flow of new converts. \nAs I have discussed elsewhere,23 inevitable internal sources of change also include the death \nof the founder, which, in all likelihood, will result in greater accountability and predictability. \nInternal decisions will need to be made on how to communicate with (and control) the \nmembership if it expands beyond a size where primary, face-to-face contact is possible. \nExternally, not only are attitudes towards the movement likely to change (perhaps relaxing as the \nmovement itself relaxes and the sharply drawn \u201cthem\u201d versus \u201cus\u201d boundary becomes \npermeable), but changes throughout society in general may also have an effect on NRMs\uf8e7the \nfall of the Berlin Wall in 1989,24 and the introduction of the Internet being but two examples.25 \nIn short, other things being equal (which, of course, they rarely are), first-generation \nmovements have a tendency to become increasingly similar to, and decreasingly in tension with, \nthe host society with the arrival of second and subsequent generations. Practices and lifestyles \nmay become more negotiable and beliefs may become more flexible as they accommodate to \nsuccessive generations and wider pools of potential converts, especially if they have had to deal \nwith the passing of endtime dates\uf8e7all of which taken together adds up to a process Niebuhr \nidentified as denominationalization.26  \n                                                 \n21 See, however, Phillip Lucas, \u201cSocial Factors in the Failure of New Religious Movements: A Case Study Using \nStark\u2019s Success Model,\u201d Syzygy 1, no. 1 (1992): 39-54; Rodney Stark, \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Christian Science,\u201d \nJournal of Contemporary Religion 13, no. 2 (1998): 189-214; Laurence Iannaccone and Rodney Stark, \u201cWhy the \nJehovah\u2019s Witnesses Grow so Rapidly,\u201d Journal of Contemporary Religion 12, no. 2 (1997): 133-57. \n22 This is a pattern I have observed with changes in The Family.

Richard Niebhur, The Social Sources of Denominationalism (New York: Holt, Rinehart & Winston, 1929).  \nSome religions, however, (such as the Amish, the Hutterites, the Bruderhof, and the Exclusive \nBrethren) will feel the need to maintain a sharp social and\/or geographical boundary to preserve \ntheir separateness from the rest of the world, and they may develop into \u201cestablished sects.\u201d \nInteresting variations can be found in situations such as the Former Soviet Union in the 1990s \nwhere there was a large influx of converts to what were by then second-generation NRMs from \nthe West.27  \nThe point being made here is that, although there may be important overlaps between sects \n(and cults) and NRMs, there are also important distinctions due in large part to NRMs\uf8e7though \nnot necessarily sects\uf8e7being comprised of first-generation converts. Although the NRM may \nexhibit some sectarian characteristics, if it is to evolve into an established sect it cannot stay \nunchanged: it has to change (in certain respects) in order to remain the same (in crucial \nrespects). \n \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nLet me end as I began, by stressing that I am not advocating that first-generation membership \nis the only useful way of defining NRMs. Paradoxically, I believe that it is also useful to talk \nabout second-generation, third-generation and even fourth-generation NRMs\uf8e7and, indeed, to \nalert scholars to important differences that can be found in movements that have a mixture of \nconverts and \u201cborn intos.\u201d Let me also repeat that I do not take issue with most of what Melton \nhas written in his article\uf8e7apart from his implication that newness may not be as significant as I, \npossibly because I am a sociologist, believe it to be. \n Of course there are problems with the term \u201cnew religious movement\u201d\uf8e7far more than have \nbeen touched on in this essay. One of the most obvious questions that remains (and perhaps has \nto remain) unanswered is: \u201cWhen does a new religion stop being new?\u201d Clearly this is not \nmerely a question of time\uf8e7yet it is to some extent a question of socially constructed time. Each \ngeneration (a similarly inexact but useful concept related to time) will have a different vision of \nthe new. In the first century, Christianity was new, in the seventh century Islam was new, in the \neighteenth century Methodism was new, in the nineteenth century the Seventh-day Adventists, \nChristadelphians and Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses were new; in the twenty-first century the Unification \nChurch, ISKCON and Scientology are beginning to look old. The confusion caused by the \nvarious generations of Japan\u2019s new religions is striking, 28  but this very fact has prompted \n                                                 \n27 Barker, \u201cBut Who\u2019s Going to Win?\u201d \n28 Some have dated Japan\u2019s new religions from 1729; others place the starting point a century later with the \nemergence of Kurozumi-ky\u00f4 (1814) and Tenriky\u00f4 (1838). Sometimes new religions that emerged after the Meiji \nRestoration (1868), such as Oomoto (1892), or between the World Wars, such as Reiy\u00fbkai (1925), S\u00f4ka Gakkai \n(1930) and Rissh\u00f4 K\u00f4sei Kai (1938) are referred to as the old new religions (these movements, which were \nsuppressed during World War II, have also been labeled sectarian Shinto or quasi-religious movements); but others \nprefer to refer to those that emerged after World War II, such as Shinnyoen (1951) and Mahikari (1959) as new \nreligions, and those founded after 1970, such as GLA (God Light Association, founded 1970), Agonsh\u00fb (1978) and \nAum Shinriky\u00f4 (1989) being referred to as new new religions. It was around 1960 that the actual term new religion \n(shin sh\u00fbky\u00f4) came into popular usage. See Nobutaka Inoue, Recent Trends in the Study of Japanese New Religions \n(Tokyo: Kokugakuin University, 1997). \nscholars to examine how the movements have responded to changing social circumstances in \nsystematically different ways.29 \nThis essay has been written with a modest objective: to alert scholars to the (surely \nindisputable) fact that there are some characteristics which are liable (not certain) to be found in \nmany (not all) first-generation movements because they are first-generation movements. If we \nwish to understand better the enormous diversity of religions that have appeared on this planet, \nwe should not forget that there are some exceedingly interesting questions raised by applying the \nvery concept of nova religio. \n \n \n                                                 \n29 See, for example, Susumu Shimazono, \u201cNew New Religions and This World: Religious Movements in Japan after \nthe 1970s and their Beliefs about Salvation,\u201d in 20 Years On: Changes in New Religious Movements, ed.
