For one of the models under consideration, I show that\nthe representative household\u2019s problem does not have an interior solution. This raises concerns since these\ncorners are inconsistent with aggregate data. Interiority is restored if preferences are modified so that human\ncapital augments the marginal utility of leisure. With this change, the optimal tax problem is analyzed and,\nreassuringly, the Jones, Manuelli, and Rossi results are confirmed: neither capital income nor labor income\nshould be taxed in steady state.\nJEL Classification: H21\nKeywords: dynamic optimal taxation, human capital\n2\n1 Introduction\nIn seminal papers, Chamley (1986) and Judd (1985) have shown that capital income should not be taxed\nin steady state. Jones, Manuelli, and Rossi (1993, 1997) (hereafter JMR) extend this result to show that\nlabor income should also be free from taxation in the limit. JMR add human capital to the model to derive\ntheir remarkable results. A key part of the analysis involves the manipulation of the household\u2019s first order\nconditions. However, it will be shown below that for a popular class of models nested within the JMR\nframework, the household\u2019s problem does not have an interior optimum: Given any interior solution to the\nfirst order conditions, there always exists a feasible variation that increases utility. This is of concern since\nan aggregative model with corners cannot fit the data. It also invites a closer look at the optimal tax results.\nThe class of models in which the difficulties arise is derived from Heckman (1976). However, in Heckman\u2019s\noriginal formulation utility depends on effective leisure \u2014 human capital multiplied by raw hours of leisure\n\u2014 while JMR\u2019s utility function depends only on raw leisure.1 If utility is returned to the original Heckman\nform, the corners disappear and the standard first order characterization of equilibrium may be used. In this\ncase, it is shown that the JMR extension of the Judd\u2013Chamley optimal tax result continues to hold. That\nis, neither labor income nor capital income should be taxed in the limit.\nSection 2 presents the JMR model and demonstrates that the household\u2019s optimum is not interior when\ntechnology has the Heckman specification. Section 3 restores interiority by taking the original Heckman\nutility function. With this change, the optimal tax policy is characterized in the limit. Section 4 is a brief\nconclusion.\n2 Model\nFirst the full JMR (1997) model is presented. Then the Heckman sub-class is considered. The representative\nhousehold is a price taker with access to accumulation technologies for both physical capital and human\ncapital. The optimization problem is\nmaximize\n\u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03b2tu(ct, 1\u2212 nmt \u2212 nht)\nsubject to\n\u221e\u2211\nt=0\npt[(1 + \u03c4 ct )ct + xht + (1 + \u03c4\nm\nt )xmt + xkt \u2212 (1\u2212 \u03c4nt )wtzt \u2212 (1\u2212 \u03c4kt )rtkt \u2212 (1 + \u03c4 ct )Tt] \u2264 b0\nkt+1 \u2264 (1\u2212 \u03b4k)kt + xkt\nht+1 \u2264 (1\u2212 \u03b4h)ht +G(xht, ht, nht)\nzt \u2264M(xmt, ht, nmt)\n1Ladro\u00b4n-de-Guevara et al. (1999) consider similar issues in a related model without taxation. They find that non-convexities\nmay arise when raw leisure enters the utility function.\n3\nwith initial conditions b0, h0, and k0 given. This appears as (P.1) on page 97 of JMR (1997). Utility\ndepends on consumption ct and hours of leisure. The time endowment is normalized to unity. Hours of\nwork are divided between the market, nmt, and human capital formation, nht. The purchased good is used\nfor investment as well as consumption: xht is investment used in the production of human capital, xkt is\ninvestment in physical capital, and xmt is investment used in the production of effective labor. Thus zt is\neffective labor. Physical capital is kt; human capital is ht; exogenous lump sum transfers are Tt; the \u03c4s are\ntax rates; b0 is initial holdings of government debt. Non-negativity conditions apply; however, it is convenient\nto allow the household to choose xkt < 0 (physical capital may be sold), though this will never occur in\nequilibrium. Current value prices rt and wt, and present value prices pt, are determined in equilibrium.\nThe depreciation rates \u03b4k and \u03b4h are given positive parameters. The production functions G and M are\nsmooth with positive and diminishing marginal products. Both G and M are homogeneous of degree one in\n(x, h).\nClearly the physical capital constraint will bind. This can be used to substitute for xkt in the budget\nconstraint. Then the problem becomes\nmax\n\u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03b2tu(ct, 1\u2212 nmt \u2212 nht)\ns.t.\n\u221e\u2211\nt=0\npt[(1 + \u03c4 ct )ct + xht + (1 + \u03c4\nm\nt )xmt + kt+1 \u2212 (1\u2212 \u03b4k)kt\n\u2212 (1\u2212 \u03c4nt )wtzt \u2212 (1\u2212 \u03c4kt )rtkt \u2212 (1 + \u03c4 ct )Tt] \u2264 b0\nht+1 \u2264 (1\u2212 \u03b4h)ht +G(xht, ht, nht)\nzt \u2264M(xmt, ht, nmt).\nFor t \u2265 0 the coefficient of kt+1 in the budget constraint is\npt \u2212 pt+1[1\u2212 \u03b4k + (1\u2212 \u03c4kt+1)rt+1]. (1)\nIf there is an interior optimum the household must face prices and taxes such that (1) equals zero for all\nt \u2265 0. See (1.d) in JMR (1997). If (1) were positive, kt+1 = 0 would be optimal. If (1) were negative,\nkt+1 \u2191 \u221e would be optimal. It is worth emphasizing this arbitrage condition for physical capital because its\ncompanion condition for human capital will play a key role in the analysis. Since (1) equals zero, and since\nthe effective labor constraint clearly binds, the household\u2019s problem becomes\n4\nmax\n\u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03b2tu(ct, 1\u2212 nmt \u2212 nht)\ns.t.\n\u221e\u2211\nt=0\npt[(1 + \u03c4 ct )ct + xht + (1 + \u03c4\nm\nt )xmt \u2212 (1\u2212 \u03c4nt )wtM(xmt, ht, nmt)\u2212 (1 + \u03c4 ct )Tt]\n\u2264 b0 + p0k0[1\u2212 \u03b4k + (1\u2212 \u03c4k0 )r0]\nht+1 \u2264 (1\u2212 \u03b4h)ht +G(xht, ht, nht).\n2.1 Heckman household technology \u2014 no interior optimum\nAt this point the household\u2019s production functions G and M are specialized as follows: G(xht, ht, nht) =\nG\u02c6(xht, nhtht) with G\u02c6 homogeneous of degree one in its two arguments, and M(xmt, ht, nmt) = nmtht. See\nHeckman (1976, p. S13) and also JMR (1993, \u00a7 III). Since xmt is no longer relevant, the household\u2019s problem\nnow becomes\nmax\n\u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03b2tu(ct, 1\u2212 nmt \u2212 nht)\ns.t.\n\u221e\u2211\nt=0\npt[(1 + \u03c4 ct )ct + xht \u2212 (1\u2212 \u03c4nt )wtnmtht \u2212 (1 + \u03c4 ct )Tt]\n\u2264 b0 + p0k0[1\u2212 \u03b4k + (1\u2212 \u03c4k0 )r0]\nht+1 \u2264 (1\u2212 \u03b4h)ht + G\u02c6(xht, nhtht).\nThe purpose of this section is to show that this problem does not have an interior solution. The method\nwill be to assume an interior solution and derive a contradiction. The Lagrangian for the problem is\nL =\n\u221e\u2211\nt=0\n{\n\u03b2tu(ct, 1\u2212 nmt \u2212 nht)\u2212 \u03bbpt[(1 + \u03c4 ct )ct + xht \u2212 (1\u2212 \u03c4nt )wtnmtht]\n+ \u00b5t[(1\u2212 \u03b4h)ht + G\u02c6(xht, nhtht)\u2212 ht+1]\n}\n.\nIf the solution were interior the first order conditions for ct, nmt, nht, xht, and ht+1 respectively would be\n\u03b2tu1(ct, 1\u2212 nmt \u2212 nht) = \u03bbpt(1 + \u03c4 ct ) (2)\n\u03b2tu2(ct, 1\u2212 nmt \u2212 nht) = \u03bbpt(1\u2212 \u03c4nt )wtht (3)\n\u03b2tu2(ct, 1\u2212 nmt \u2212 nht) = \u00b5thtG\u02c62(xht, nhtht) (4)\n\u03bbpt = \u00b5tG\u02c61(xht, nhtht) (5)\n\u03bbpt+1(1\u2212 \u03c4nt+1)wt+1nmt+1 = \u00b5t \u2212 \u00b5t+1[1\u2212 \u03b4h + nht+1G\u02c62(xht+1, nht+1ht+1)]. (6)\n5\nAgain, the goal is to use the first order conditions, and more generally use the assumption of interiority,\nto generate a contradiction. From (3), (4), and (5),\nG\u02c62(xht, nhtht)\/G\u02c61(xht, nhtht) = (1\u2212 \u03c4nt )wt, t \u2265 0. (7)\nThis looks very much like the first order condition for a cost minimization problem. Indeed, this is the case.\nLet `t = 1\u2212 nmt \u2212 nht denote hours of leisure. Then the household\u2019s problem can be written as\nmax\n\u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03b2tu(ct, `t)\ns.t.\n\u221e\u2211\nt=0\npt[(1 + \u03c4 ct )ct + xht \u2212 (1\u2212 \u03c4nt )wtht(1\u2212 `t \u2212 nht)\u2212 (1 + \u03c4 ct )Tt]\n\u2264 b0 + p0k0[1\u2212 \u03b4k + (1\u2212 \u03c4k0 )r0]\nht+1 \u2264 (1\u2212 \u03b4h)ht + G\u02c6(xht, nhtht)\n1\u2212 `t \u2212 nht \u2265 0.\nSince h, xh, and nh do not appear in the utility function, they will be chosen to maximize income, i.e., to\nminimize\n\u2211\u221e\nt=0 pt[xht \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03c4nt )wtht(1 \u2212 `t \u2212 nht)] subject to the human capital accumulation constraint\nand the non-negativity of market hours. In particular, for any {`t, ht}\u221et=0, the household will choose xht and\nnht to minimize xht + (1 \u2212 \u03c4nt )wthtnht subject to these constraints. This is a standard cost minimization\nproblem with an upper bound on one of the inputs. Under the maintained assumption that the solution\nis interior, it will satisfy (7). Since G\u02c6 is homogeneous of degree one, the minimized cost is proportional to\n\u201coutput:\u201d xht + (1\u2212 \u03c4nt )wthtnht = [ht+1 \u2212 (1\u2212 \u03b4h)ht]\u03be(1, (1\u2212 \u03c4nt )wt) where \u03be is the unit cost function for\nG\u02c6(xh, zh).\nSubstitute the minimized cost back into the budget constraint. The household\u2019s problem becomes\nmax\n\u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03b2tu(ct, `t)\ns.t.\n\u221e\u2211\nt=0\npt\n{\n(1 + \u03c4 ct )ct + [ht+1 \u2212 (1\u2212 \u03b4h)ht]\u03be(1, (1\u2212 \u03c4nt )wt)\u2212 (1\u2212 \u03c4nt )wtht(1\u2212 `t)\u2212 (1 + \u03c4 ct )Tt\n}\n\u2264 b0 + p0k0[1\u2212 \u03b4k + (1\u2212 \u03c4k0 )r0].\nCollect together the terms with ht and re-write the budget constraint as follows:\np0(1 + \u03c4 c0 )(c0 \u2212 T0) +\n\u221e\u2211\nt=1\n{\npt(1 + \u03c4 ct )(ct \u2212 Tt)\n+ht[pt\u22121\u03be(1, (1\u2212 \u03c4nt\u22121)wt\u22121)\u2212 pt(1\u2212 \u03b4h)\u03be(1, (1\u2212 \u03c4nt )wt)\u2212 pt(1\u2212 \u03c4nt )wt(1\u2212 `t)]\n}\n\u2264 b0 + p0k0[1\u2212 \u03b4k + (1\u2212 \u03c4k0 )r0] + p0h0[(1\u2212 \u03b4h)\u03be(1, (1\u2212 \u03c4n0 )w0) + (1\u2212 \u03c4n0 )w0(1\u2212 `0)]. (8)\n6\nAt an interior optimum, the coefficient of ht in (8) must equal zero:2\npt\u22121\u03be(1, (1\u2212 \u03c4nt\u22121)wt\u22121)\u2212 pt(1\u2212 \u03b4h)\u03be(1, (1\u2212 \u03c4nt )wt)\u2212 pt(1\u2212 \u03c4nt )wt(1\u2212 `t) = 0, t \u2265 1. (9)\nThis states that the present value cost of a marginal unit of human capital (pt\u22121\u03bet\u22121) equals its stock value\nnext period (pt(1\u2212 \u03b4h)\u03bet) plus its flow return (pt(1\u2212 \u03c4nt )wt(nmt+nht)). The flow rate of return is equalized\nacross market hours and training hours due to the static optimality conditions. But note that the marginal\nunit of human capital does not augment the value of leisure hours since human capital does not enter the\nutility function (cf. Ladro\u00b4n-de-Guevara et al., 1999).\nIf the expression in (9) were strictly negative (positive), any increase (decrease) in ht would provide more\nincome for consumption, so optimality and interiority would be incompatible. This is much like the reasoning\nassociated with (1) above. However, there is a key difference here. There is a choice variable in (9): `t. So\nthis is not a standard arbitrage condition on prices.\nLet the superscript zero denote the hypothesized interior optimum, e.g., `0t . Consider a variation c\u02dcs, \u02dc`s,\nh\u02dcs at a given s \u2265 1.3 Since the interior optimum satisfies (9), and since the variation must also satisfy the\nbudget constraint (8), it must be that\nps(1+\u03c4 cs )c\n0\ns = ps(1+\u03c4\nc\ns )c\u02dcs+ h\u02dcs\n[\nps\u22121\u03be(1, (1\u2212\u03c4ns\u22121)ws\u22121)\u2212ps(1\u2212\u03b4h)\u03be(1, (1\u2212\u03c4ns )ws)\u2212ps(1\u2212\u03c4ns )ws(1\u2212 \u02dc`s)\n]\n.\nIn particular, if \u02dc`s = `0s + \u000f`, then\nps(1 + \u03c4 cs )c\n0\ns = ps(1 + \u03c4\nc\ns )c\u02dcs + h\u02dcsps(1\u2212 \u03c4ns )ws\u000f` (10)\nsince (9) vanishes at the interior optimum. If also h\u02dcs = h0s + \u000fh then (10) yields\nc\u02dcs = c0s \u2212 (h0s + \u000fh)(1\u2212 \u03c4ns )ws\u000f`\/(1 + \u03c4 cs ).\nHence u(c\u02dcs, \u02dc`s) = u(c0s \u2212 (h0s + \u000fh)(1\u2212 \u03c4ns )ws\u000f`\/(1 + \u03c4 cs ), `0s + \u000f`) and\n\u2202u(c\u02dcs, \u02dc`s)\n\u2202\u000f`\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u000f`=0\n= \u2212(h0s+\u000fh)(1\u2212\u03c4ns )wsu1(c0s, `0s)\/(1+\u03c4 cs )+u2(c0s, `0s) = \u2212\u000fh(1\u2212\u03c4ns )wsu1(c0s, `0s)\/(1+\u03c4 cs ) (11)\nwhere the last equality follows from the static interior optimum condition u02\/u\n0\n1 = (1 \u2212 \u03c4ns )wsh0s\/(1 + \u03c4 cs ),\nimplied by (2) and (3). From (11), for any \u000fh < 0 and for sufficiently small \u000f` > 0, the variation raises\nwelfare. This is inconsistent with the optimality of the interior solution.4 Thus, the assumption of an\ninterior optimum leads to a contradiction.\n2Lemma A.1 in the appendix confirms that the first order conditions (3)\u2013(6) imply (9).\n3I.e., for all t 6= s, consumption, leisure, and human capital remain c0t , `0t , and h0t . Also, note that the variation h\u02dcs induces\nvariations x\u02dchs\u22121, n\u02dchs\u22121, x\u02dchs, n\u02dchs through the cost minimization problem associated with (7). Similarly, there are induced\nvariations in n\u02dcms\u22121 and n\u02dcms.\n4Another possibility that could prevent the variation from raising utility is ws = 0. But then the household would have no\nincentive to do any market work at s: n0ms = 0. Again, this would violate the interiority assumption.\n7\n3 Optimal taxation with Heckman utility\nThis section revisits the optimal taxation results in JMR (1997). JMR show that both capital and labor\nincome should not be taxed in the limit. This result is derived from the assumption of an interior solution to\nthe household\u2019s problem. But as shown in section 2.1 above, the household\u2019s optimum is not interior when\nhousehold technology takes the Heckman (1976) form. Interiority may be restored, however, if the household\nnot only has Heckman technology but also Heckman (1976) utility:\nu(ct, (1\u2212 nmt \u2212 nht)ht).\nThat is, utility is generated from effective leisure and not merely hours of leisure. With this change, it will\nbe shown that the JMR result continues to hold: the steady state tax rate is zero for both capital income\nand labor income.\n3.1 Household\u2019s problem\nWith the modified utility function, the first order conditions for an interior optimum become\n\u03b2tu1(ct, (1\u2212 nmt \u2212 nht)ht) = \u03bbpt(1 + \u03c4 ct ) (2\u2032)\n\u03b2tu2(ct, (1\u2212 nmt \u2212 nht)ht) = \u03bbpt(1\u2212 \u03c4nt )wt (3\u2032)\n\u03b2tu2(ct, (1\u2212 nmt \u2212 nht)ht) = \u00b5tG\u02c62(xht, nhtht) (4\u2032)\n\u03bbpt = \u00b5tG\u02c61(xht, nhtht) (5\u2032)\n\u03bbpt+1(1\u2212 \u03c4nt+1)wt+1nmt+1 = \u00b5t \u2212 \u00b5t+1[1\u2212 \u03b4h + nht+1G\u02c62(xht+1, nht+1ht+1)]\n\u2212 \u03b2t+1(1\u2212 nmt+1 \u2212 nht+1)u2(ct+1, (1\u2212 nmt+1 \u2212 nht+1)ht+1). (6\u2032)\nThe analysis of the household\u2019s problem proceeds as in section 2.1. The cost minimization problem\nassociated with (7) still applies, and hence so does the budget constraint (8). With hours of leisure given by\n`t = 1\u2212 nmt \u2212 nht, the household solves\nmax\n\u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03b2tu(ct, `tht)\ns.t. p0(1 + \u03c4 c0 )(c0 \u2212 T0) +\n\u221e\u2211\nt=1\n{\npt(1 + \u03c4 ct )(ct \u2212 Tt)\n+ht[pt\u22121\u03be(1, (1\u2212 \u03c4nt\u22121)wt\u22121)\u2212 pt(1\u2212 \u03b4h)\u03be(1, (1\u2212 \u03c4nt )wt)\u2212 pt(1\u2212 \u03c4nt )wt(1\u2212 `t)]\n}\n\u2264 b0 + p0k0[1\u2212 \u03b4k + (1\u2212 \u03c4k0 )r0] + p0h0[(1\u2212 \u03b4h)\u03be(1, (1\u2212 \u03c4n0 )w0) + (1\u2212 \u03c4n0 )w0(1\u2212 `0)].\n8\nUnlike the analysis of (8) and (9) above, here the first order conditions do not cause the coefficient of ht in\nthis budget constraint to vanish. To see this, re-write the budget constraint but separate out the term with\neffective leisure:\np0(1 + \u03c4 c0 )(c0 \u2212 T0) +\n\u221e\u2211\nt=1\n{\npt(1 + \u03c4 ct )(ct \u2212 Tt) + pt(1\u2212 \u03c4nt )wt`tht\n+ht[pt\u22121\u03be(1, (1\u2212 \u03c4nt\u22121)wt\u22121)\u2212 pt(1\u2212 \u03b4h)\u03be(1, (1\u2212 \u03c4nt )wt)\u2212 pt(1\u2212 \u03c4nt )wt]\n}\n\u2264 b0 + p0k0[1\u2212 \u03b4k + (1\u2212 \u03c4k0 )r0] + p0h0[(1\u2212 \u03b4h)\u03be(1, (1\u2212 \u03c4n0 )w0) + (1\u2212 \u03c4n0 )w0(1\u2212 `0)]. (12)\nAt an interior optimum, the coefficient of ht in the second line of (12) must equal zero:5\npt\u22121\u03be(1, (1\u2212 \u03c4nt\u22121)wt\u22121)\u2212 pt(1\u2212 \u03b4h)\u03be(1, (1\u2212 \u03c4nt )wt)\u2212 pt(1\u2212 \u03c4nt )wt = 0, t \u2265 1. (13)\nThis is based on a standard arbitrage argument. E.g., if the expression in (13) were negative, any increase in\nht would provide more income for consumption. And this increase in ht could be matched with a reduction\nin `t to leave effective leisure unchanged \u2014 both in the first line of (12) and also in the utility function. The\nkey distinction between (13) and the more problematic (9) is the presence of the choice variable `t in the\nlatter. By contrast, in (13) the flow return to a marginal unit of human capital, pt(1\u2212 \u03c4nt )wt, applies to all\nhours, even leisure, due to the Heckman specification for preferences.\nGiven (13), the household\u2019s problem is (after re-arranging)\nmax\n\u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03b2tu(ct, `tht)\ns.t.\n\u221e\u2211\nt=0\n[\npt(1 + \u03c4 ct )(ct \u2212 Tt) + pt(1\u2212 \u03c4nt )wt`tht\n]\n\u2264 b0 + p0k0[1\u2212 \u03b4k + (1\u2212 \u03c4k0 )r0] + p0h0[(1\u2212 \u03b4h)\u03be(1, (1\u2212 \u03c4n0 )w0) + (1\u2212 \u03c4n0 )w0].\nThis is a completely standard dynamic utility maximization problem with choice variables ct and z`t := `tht.\nThe first order conditions are (2\u2032) and (3\u2032).\nIn summary, for t \u2265 0 the conditions for a household optimum are as follows:\npt\/pt+1 = 1\u2212 \u03b4k + (1\u2212 \u03c4kt+1)rt+1 (1\u2032)\nG\u02c62(xht, nhtht)\/G\u02c61(xht, nhtht) = (1\u2212 \u03c4nt )wt (7)\npt\u03be(1, (1\u2212 \u03c4nt )wt)\u2212 pt+1(1\u2212 \u03b4h)\u03be(1, (1\u2212 \u03c4nt+1)wt+1)\u2212 pt+1(1\u2212 \u03c4nt+1)wt+1 = 0 (13)\n5Lemma A.2 in the appendix confirms that the first order conditions (3\u2032)\u2013(6\u2032) imply (13).\n9\n\u03b2tu1(ct, `tht) = \u03bbpt(1 + \u03c4 ct ) (2\n\u2032)\n\u03b2tu2(ct, `tht) = \u03bbpt(1\u2212 \u03c4nt )wt (3\u2032)\nkt+1 = (1\u2212 \u03b4k)kt + xkt (14)\nht+1 = (1\u2212 \u03b4h)ht + G\u02c6(xht, nhtht) (15)\n1 = `t + nmt + nht (16)\n\u221e\u2211\nt=0\n[\npt(1 + \u03c4 ct )(ct \u2212 Tt) + pt(1\u2212 \u03c4nt )wt`tht\n]\n= b0 + p0k0[1\u2212 \u03b4k + (1\u2212 \u03c4k0 )r0] + p0h0[(1\u2212 \u03b4h)\u03be(1, (1\u2212 \u03c4n0 )w0) + (1\u2212 \u03c4n0 )w0]. (17)\n3.2 Equilibrium\nThe optimal tax problem is to select the equilibrium that gives the greatest utility to the household. In\naddition to the household\u2019s optimality conditions, equilibrium is characterized by the firms\u2019 optimality\nconditions and by goods market clearing (details below).\nIt is convenient to express the equilibrium entirely in terms of primal variables \u2014 quantities rather than\nprices. Thus some of the household\u2019s optimality conditions may be regarded as definitions of after tax prices,\nfor a given allocation. Specifically, (7) defines the after tax wage, then (13) defines the price ratio pt\/pt+1:\npt\npt+1\n= (1\u2212 \u03b4h)\n\u03be(1, (1\u2212 \u03c4nt+1)wt+1)\n\u03be(1, (1\u2212 \u03c4nt )wt)\n+\nG\u02c62(xht+1, nht+1ht+1)\/G\u02c61(xht+1, nht+1ht+1)\n\u03be(1, (1\u2212 \u03c4nt )wt)\n. (18)\nSince \u03be is the unit cost function for G\u02c6, the cost minimizers satisfy\nG\u02c6(xht, nhtht)\u03be(1, (1\u2212 \u03c4nt )wt) = xht + nhtht(1\u2212 \u03c4nt )wt\n= xht + nhtht\nG\u02c62(xht, nhtht)\nG\u02c61(xht, nhtht)\n=\nG\u02c6(xht, nhtht)\nG\u02c61(xht, nhtht)\nwhere the last line follows from homogeneity. Therefore \u03be(1, (1\u2212 \u03c4nt )wt) = 1\/G\u02c61(xht, nhtht) and (18) yields\npt\npt+1\n=\nG\u02c61(xht, nhtht)\nG\u02c61(xht+1, nht+1ht+1)\n(\n1\u2212 \u03b4h + G\u02c62(xht+1, nht+1ht+1)\n)\n, t \u2265 0. (19)\nWith this result, (1\u2032) then defines the after tax interest rate for t \u2265 1. Note that p0 and (1 \u2212 \u03c4k0 )r0 are\nnot restricted. Also, (2\u2032) at t \u2265 1 divided by (2\u2032) at time 0 yields \u03c4 ct , but \u03c4 c0 is unrestricted at this point.\n10\n(Footnote 6 will identify \u03c4 c0 .) Equation (3\n\u2032) presents a real restriction since the after tax wage and the present\nvalue price pt have already been determined. From (3\u2032) and (7),\nu2(ct, `tht)\n\u03b2u2(ct+1, `t+1ht+1)\n=\nG\u02c62(xht, nhtht)\/G\u02c61(xht, nhtht)\nG\u02c62(xht+1, nht+1ht+1)\/G\u02c61(xht+1, nht+1ht+1)\n\u00b7 pt\npt+1\n=\nG\u02c62(xht, nhtht)\nG\u02c62(xht+1, nht+1ht+1)\n(\n1\u2212 \u03b4h + G\u02c62(xht+1, nht+1ht+1)\n)\n, t \u2265 0 (20)\nwhere the second line follows from (19).6 This is analogous to the restriction \u03c6(vt\u22121, vt) = 0 in problem (P.2)\non page 100 of JMR (1997).\nIn order to express the budget constraint (17) in primal form, multiply through by the Lagrange multiplier\n\u03bb and use (2\u2032) and (3\u2032) to get\n\u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03b2t\n[\n(ct \u2212 Tt)u1(ct, `tht) + `thtu2(ct, `tht)\n]\n= \u03bbb0 + \u03bbp0k0[1\u2212 \u03b4k + (1\u2212 \u03c4k0 )r0] + \u03bbp0h0[(1\u2212 \u03b4h)\u03be(1, (1\u2212 \u03c4n0 )w0) + (1\u2212 \u03c4n0 )w0]\n=\nu2(0)G\u02c61(0)\nG\u02c62(0)\n{\nb0\/p0 + k0[1\u2212 \u03b4k + (1\u2212 \u03c4k0 )r0] + h0[(1\u2212 \u03b4h) + G\u02c62(0)]\/G\u02c61(0)\n}\n(21)\nwhere the last line uses (3\u2032) and (7) at t = 0 to substitute for \u03bb, and also uses previous results to substitute\nfor terms with (1\u2212 \u03c4n0 )w0.\nThe other equilibrium conditions are that firms are price taking profit maximizers and that the goods\nmarket clears. The production function F for the purchased good is homogeneous of degree one in physical\ncapital and effective labor. Thus profits will be zero. For t \u2265 0,\nF1(kt, nmtht) = rt (22)\nF2(kt, nmtht) = wt (23)\nF (kt, nmtht) = ct + kt+1 \u2212 (1\u2212 \u03b4k)kt + xht + gt. (24)\nIn (24), government purchases, gt, are exogenously given. Also, (24) subsumes the physical capital accumu-\nlation equation (14). Equations (22) and (23) do not impose constraints on the primal form of the optimal\ntax problem. They can be used to define the before tax interest rate and wage.\nThus, in terms of primal variables, equilibrium is characterized by (15), (16), (20), (21), and (24). In\nthe last line of (21), p0 and \u03c4k0 are unrestricted while r0 is defined by (22). By Walras\u2019 law, when these\nconditions are satisfied the government\u2019s infinite horizon present value budget constraint is redundant.\n6It appears (3\u2032) also presents a restriction at time 0. From (7), (2\u2032), and (3\u2032) at t = 0, u2(c0, `0h0)\/u1(c0, `0h0) =\n(1+ \u03c4c0 )\n\u22121G\u02c62(xh0, nh0h0)\/G\u02c61(xh0, nh0h0). However, this is not a restriction. Rather, it can be used to define \u03c4c0 since (2\n\u2032) left\n\u03c4c0 available.\n11\n3.3 Optimal tax problem\nThe tax problem is not particularly interesting if the government can confiscate initial wealth. Thus it is\ncustomary to assign reasonable exogenous values to p0 and \u03c4k0 in (21). Let zmt := nmtht and zht := nhtht\ndenote effective labor for the market and for human capital accumulation. The tax problem is as follows:\nmax\n\u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03b2tu(ct, ht \u2212 zmt \u2212 zht)\ns.t.\n\u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03b2t\n[\n(ct \u2212 Tt)u1(ct, ht \u2212 zmt \u2212 zht) + (ht \u2212 zmt \u2212 zht)u2(ct, ht \u2212 zmt \u2212 zht)\n]\n= A0\nht+1 = (1\u2212 \u03b4h)ht + G\u02c6(xht, zht)\nF (kt, zmt) = ct + kt+1 \u2212 (1\u2212 \u03b4k)kt + xht + gt\nu2(ct, ht \u2212 zmt \u2212 zht)\n\u03b2u2(ct+1, ht+1 \u2212 zmt+1 \u2212 zht+1) =\nG\u02c62(xht, zht)\nG\u02c62(xht+1, zht+1)\n(\n1\u2212 \u03b4h + G\u02c62(xht+1, zht+1)\n)\nwhere A0 in the first constraint denotes the last line of (21). Let \u03b8 be the Lagrange multiplier for the first\nconstraint. As in JMR (1997), introduce the auxiliary function\nW (ct, ht \u2212 zmt \u2212 zht, Tt, \u03b8) :=\nu(ct, ht \u2212 zmt \u2212 zht) + \u03b8\n[\n(ct \u2212 Tt)u1(ct, ht \u2212 zmt \u2212 zht) + (ht \u2212 zmt \u2212 zht)u2(ct, ht \u2212 zmt \u2212 zht)\n]\n.\nThen the Lagrangian for the problem is\nL = \u2212\u03b8A0 +\n\u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03b2t\n{\nW (ct, ht \u2212 zmt \u2212 zht, Tt, \u03b8) + \u03bd1t[(1\u2212 \u03b4h)ht + G\u02c6(xht, zht)\u2212 ht+1]\n+ \u03bd2t[F (kt, zmt)\u2212 ct \u2212 kt+1 + (1\u2212 \u03b4k)kt \u2212 xht]\n+ \u03bd3t\n[\nu2(ct, ht \u2212 zmt \u2212 zht)\nu2(ct+1, ht+1 \u2212 zmt+1 \u2212 zht+1) \u2212\n\u03b2(1\u2212 \u03b4h)G\u02c62(xht, zht)\nG\u02c62(xht+1, zht+1)\n\u2212 \u03b2G\u02c62(xht, zht)\n]}\n.\nSuppose the optimal tax equilibrium converges to an interior steady state in which all variables have\nfinite limits, including Lagrange multipliers. Let asterisks denote steady state values. Then in the limit the\nfirst order conditions for ct, ht, zmt, zht, xht, and kt yield\nW \u22171 \u2212 \u03bd\u22172 + (1\u2212 \u03b2\u22121)\u03bd\u22173u\u221721\/u\u22172 = 0 (25)\nW \u22172 + (1\u2212 \u03b4h)\u03bd\u22171 \u2212 \u03b2\u22121\u03bd\u22171 + (1\u2212 \u03b2\u22121)\u03bd\u22173u\u221722\/u\u22172 = 0 (26)\n\u2212W \u22172 + \u03bd\u22172F \u22172 \u2212 (1\u2212 \u03b2\u22121)\u03bd\u22173u\u221722\/u\u22172 = 0 (27)\n\u2212W \u22172 + \u03bd\u22171 G\u02c6\u22172 \u2212 (1\u2212 \u03b2\u22121)\u03bd\u22173\n(\nu\u221722\/u\n\u2217\n2 + \u03b2(1\u2212 \u03b4h)G\u02c6\u221722\/G\u02c6\u22172\n)\u2212 \u03b2\u03bd\u22173 G\u02c6\u221722 = 0 (28)\n12\n\u03bd\u22171 G\u02c6\n\u2217\n1 \u2212 \u03bd\u22172 \u2212 (1\u2212 \u03b2\u22121)\u03bd\u22173\u03b2(1\u2212 \u03b4h)G\u02c6\u221721\/G\u02c6\u22172 \u2212 \u03b2\u03bd\u22173 G\u02c6\u221721 = 0 (29)\n\u03bd\u22172 (F\n\u2217\n1 + 1\u2212 \u03b4k)\u2212 \u03b2\u22121\u03bd\u22172 = 0. (30)\nThe main result may now be stated.\nTheorem If \u03bd\u22172 6= 0 then the steady state tax rate is zero for both capital income and labor income.\nProof The Chamley\u2013Judd result that \u03c4k\u2217 = 0 is straightforward. If \u03bd\u22172 6= 0, (30) yields F \u22171 + 1\u2212 \u03b4k = \u03b2\u22121.\nFrom (19) and (20), pt\/pt+1 converges to \u03b2\u22121. Hence (1\u2032) yields 1 \u2212 \u03b4k + (1 \u2212 \u03c4k\u2217)r\u2217 = \u03b2\u22121. Since r = F1\nfrom (22), the result follows.\nNext it will be shown that \u03bd\u22173 = 0. This will then be used to prove \u03c4\nn\u2217 = 0. Add (26) and (28) to get\n\u03bd\u22171 (1\u2212 \u03b4h + G\u02c6\u22172 \u2212 \u03b2\u22121) + \u03b2\u03bd\u22173 G\u02c6\u221722[(\u03b2\u22121 \u2212 1)(1\u2212 \u03b4h)\/G\u02c6\u22172 \u2212 1] = 0.\nIn steady state, (20) yields \u03b2\u22121 = 1\u2212 \u03b4h+ G\u02c6\u22172. Hence \u03b2\u03bd\u22173 G\u02c6\u221722[(\u03b2\u22121\u2212 1)(1\u2212 \u03b4h)\/G\u02c6\u22172\u2212 1] = 0. Since \u03b4h 6= 0,\nit follows that \u03bd\u22173 = 0.\nFinally it will be shown that \u03c4n\u2217 = 0. With \u03bd\u22173 = 0 and \u03bd\n\u2217\n2 6= 0, (29) implies \u03bd\u22171 6= 0. Thus (28) and (29)\nyield G\u02c6\u22172\/G\u02c6\n\u2217\n1 = W\n\u2217\n2 \/\u03bd\n\u2217\n2 , while (27) yields W\n\u2217\n2 \/\u03bd\n\u2217\n2 = F\n\u2217\n2 . Hence G\u02c6\n\u2217\n2\/G\u02c6\n\u2217\n1 = F\n\u2217\n2 . And from (7) and (23), this is\nprecisely the condition under which \u03c4n\u2217 = 0.\n4 Conclusion\nFor the model in section 2.1, the household\u2019s problem fails to have an interior optimum. Thus, this model is\nnot well suited for the analysis of optimal taxation. With the modification to utility in section 3, interiority\nis restored and the optimal tax problem yields the JMR (1997) result: neither labor income nor capital\nincome should be taxed in steady state.\nThe intuition for the Judd\u2013Chamley zero capital tax result is based on the idea that a tax on capital\nincome is a tax on future consumption. This creates a distortionary wedge between the intertemporal\nmarginal rate of substitution for consumption and the corresponding marginal rate of transformation. This\nwedge grows exponentially through time \u2014 just like compound interest (Judd, 2002). Hence even a small\ncapital income tax can generate large distortions if it is left in place a long time.\nWhen human capital is present, similar reasoning applies. The accumulation technology for human\ncapital creates an additional channel through which taxation can potentially cause explosive intertemporal\ndistortions. Hence, at an optimal steady state, the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution for effective\nleisure will equal the corresponding marginal rate of transformation. In terms of the model, this implies\nthat constraint (20) will automatically be satisfied at an optimal steady state. Since this constraint does\nnot bind, in the limit the economy behaves as if there were no restrictions on the tax instruments.7 Thus\n7Equation (20) is an instrument restriction. It imposes the same tax rates on both the consumer and the human capital\nproducer.\n13\nthe Diamond\u2013Mirrlees (1971) production efficiency theorem applies: Marginal rates of transformation must\nbe equal in the two production sectors, human capital and physical capital\/consumption. Inspection of (7)\nand (23) reveals that this efficiency condition yields a zero tax rate on labor income. In the limit, this tax\nmust vanish; otherwise the two production sectors would face different relative prices.\nFinally, given the problems with non-interiority that were considered here, one is led to wonder if other\nhuman capital models may lead to similar difficulties.8 It seems that caution is warranted in these situations.\n8Ortigueira and Santos (2002) use a continuous time model with human capital and find that equilibrium is characterized\nby corners for some parameter values and tax rates.\n14\nAppendix\nA.1 Lemma If (3)\u2013(6) are satisfied for all t \u2265 0 with \u03bb 6= 0 then (9) must hold for all t \u2265 1.\nProof Use (3) and (4) to substitute for \u00b5t+1G\u02c62(t+ 1) in (6):\n\u03bbpt+1(1\u2212 \u03c4nt+1)wt+1nmt+1 = \u00b5t \u2212 \u00b5t+1(1\u2212 \u03b4h)\u2212 \u03bbpt+1(1\u2212 \u03c4nt+1)wt+1nht+1, t \u2265 0.\nTherefore, since `t+1 + nmt+1 + nht+1 = 1,\n0 = \u00b5t \u2212 \u00b5t+1(1\u2212 \u03b4h)\u2212 \u03bbpt+1(1\u2212 \u03c4nt+1)wt+1(1\u2212 `t+1), t \u2265 0\nor\n0 = \u00b5t\u22121 \u2212 \u00b5t(1\u2212 \u03b4h)\u2212 \u03bbpt(1\u2212 \u03c4nt )wt(1\u2212 `t), t \u2265 1.\nA comparison with (9) shows that the lemma will be proved if \u00b5t\/\u03bb = pt\u03be(1, (1\u2212 \u03c4nt )wt) for all t \u2265 0.
