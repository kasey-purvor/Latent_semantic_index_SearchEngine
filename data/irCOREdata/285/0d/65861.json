This agential conception is flattering, but in this paper I will argue that it con-\nceals amore complex truth about what persons are. In 1. I set the issues in context. In\n2. I critically explore four features commonly presented as fundamental to person-\nhood in versions of the agential conception: action, capability, choice and indepen-\ndence. In 3. I argue that each of these agential features presupposes a non-agential\nfeature: agency presupposes patiency, capability presupposes incapability, choice\npresupposes necessity and independence presupposes dependency. In 4. I argue\nthat such non-agential features, as well as being implicit within the agential con-\nception, are as apt to be constitutive of personhood as agential features, and in 5. I\nconclude.\n1. Introduction\nWhat is a person? The question looks innocent enough, but philoso-\nphical confusions and political prejudices lie in wait all around, set to\nengulf the unwary. My work on this topic started when I began to\nnotice that abject features of human life like suffering, weakness, vul-\nnerability, constraint, dependency seem to get very little philosophi-\ncal attention. It struck me that these aspects might well be\nmetaphysically, ethically and politically important. I wondered\nwhy, when they shape the lives of persons so profoundly, they are\nso neglected. I began to suspect they are ignored not because they\nare negligible, but because we are biased towards thinking of\npersons as agents.\nThe bias is profound. It is rare to find it stated in the form of the\nclaim \u2018persons are agents\u2019, or to find philosophical arguments offered\nin support of it. Instead, it is presumed, mentioned if at all as a\ngesture in passing, a presumption, a shared starting point for any reflec-\ntion on persons. For example, Charles Taylor describes his project at\nthe beginning of Sources of the Self as \u2018tracing. . .our modern notion\nof what it is to be a human agent, a person, or a self\u2019.1 Treating\n1 C. Taylor, Sources of the Self (Cambridge Mass.: Harvard University\nPress, 1989), 3.\n579\n10.1017\/S0031819107000162 &2007 The Royal Institute of Philosophy\nPhilosophy 82 2007\n\u2018agent\u2019 as equivalent to \u2018person\u2019 or \u2018self\u2019 here is not meant to introduce\nany new or difficult idea. It is simply meant to gesture at a common\nunderstanding on which Taylor will rely.\nThe agential bias is not limited to philosophers. It is a vast invisible\nstructure which pervades our culture. It says: when I am an agent,\nI am, I count. But when I am passive, incapable, constrained, depen-\ndent, I am less a person, I count less. The bias is so strong and so\ndeep, that even compassionate thinkers strongly committed to\nacknowledging dependencies and meeting needs, still think our pol-\nitical taskmust be to \u2018enable\u2019 anyonewho is passive, suffering, subject\nto necessities, etc. to get a bit more agency, and to become, thereby,\nmore of a person.\nTo evaluate the agential conception, wemust first make it explicit. I\nattempt this by discussing philosophical workwhich I think shows the\nagential conception and its problems well. As my targets are not\n\u2018theories\u2019 which list agential features as necessary and sufficient for\npersonhood, my aim is not to refute such theories, still less to\nreplace them with a \u2018patiential\u2019 theory of my own. Rather, my aim is\nto show how the agential conception is more problematic, concep-\ntually, metaphysically, ethically and politically, than we imagined. I\nwill arguewe should broaden our conception to include patiential fea-\ntures, and modify our claims about the agential features to offer an\naccount of personhood that is more balanced and realistic, less of a\nfantasy.\nI think of the question, \u2018what is a person?\u2019, as an ordinary ques-\ntion, the kind of question a child might ask. The question is\n\u2018scientific\u2019 in the sense that it seeks worldly facts about the kind\nof creature a person is, about a form of life. It is true that the ques-\ntion can take on a different guise depending on the purpose for\nand context in which it is asked. If for example we presume\npersons are the morally significant beings par excellance, the\nquestion \u2018what is a person\u2019 may signal a search for criteria to dis-\ntinguish morally significant from negligible beings.2 And if our\nproject is to define social justice, we may think we should divide\nanswers into two kinds, \u2018metaphysical\u2019 and \u2018political\u2019, to allow\nourselves to bracket one kind of question and concentrate on the\nother.\n2 See M-A. Warren, Moral Status (Oxford: Oxford University Press,\n2000) for a discussion of different forms this approach can take. See my\nNeeds and Moral Necessity (London: Routledge, 2007) for criticism of the\nidea that personhood should define or limit moral significance.\n580\nSoran Reader\nContemporary philosophers JohnRawls, TimScanlon andMartha\nNussbaum take this approach.3 Rawls, for example, says the \u2018political\u2019\nconception of the person as citizen, while itmay \u2018presuppose . . .meta-\nphysical theses about the nature of persons\u2019, does not \u2018distinguish\nbetween the distinctive metaphysical views\u2014Cartesian, Leibnizian,\nKantian; realist, idealist or materialist\u2019.4 Unfortunately Rawls\u2019 analy-\nsis does not go deep enough to reveal themistake hemakes here. From\nthe perspective of this paper, his examples of \u2018distinctive metaphys-\nical views\u2019 are actually all of one type, the agential conception.\nBecause this is a metaphysical mistake, we need metaphysical analysis\nto unsettle it. Excluding metaphysics from the discussion of persons\nas citizens makes it impossible to see, let alone correct, any bad poli-\ntics that may be elaborated out of the agential conception.\nWe have the philosophical resources for an inquiry into person-\nhood that is both metaphysical and political (and conceptual and\nethical). The \u2018person as citizen\u2019 just is the \u2018metaphysical\u2019 person con-\nsidered under the aspect of being amember of a community. Aristotle\nis most helpful here. He is not on Rawls\u2019 list\u2014and the omission is not\nsurprising, since Aristotle\u2019s account of the person includesmetaphys-\nical and political aspects. For Aristotle man is by nature \u2018an animal . . .\ncapable of acquiring reason and knowledge\u2019, and also \u2018a political\nanimal\u2019.5 Aristotle\u2019s philosophy of the person is conceptual, meta-\nphysical, ethical and political\u2014the aspects are joined up in his\nthought. I will try to keep them joined up here.\nTo talk about non-agential personhood, we need some terminology.\nIn this paper, drawing on Aristotle\u2019s analysis, I use the word \u2018patient\u2019\nas the correlate of \u2018agent\u2019. A being is a \u2018patient\u2019 in this sense when it is\nacted on. I suspect \u2018patiency\u2019 in this sense is as inalienable and central\nto personhood as \u2018agency\u2019 is more commonly assumed to be. I want as\nit were to rewrite the quotation from Taylor above, and \u2018to trace our\nnotion of what it is to be a human patient, a person or a self\u2019. But in\nour culture the \u2018patient\u2019 is given their proper name only in medicine.\nIt causes a peculiar difficulty for efforts to unsettle the agential con-\nception like mine, that when we hear the word \u2018patient\u2019, we think\nnot of beings acted upon, but specifically of human beings who are\n3 See J. Rawls \u2018Justice as Fairness: Political not Metaphysical\u2019,\nPhilosophy and Public Affairs, 14, 227\u2013251; T. Scanlon, What We Owe to\nEach Other (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press); M. Nussbaum\n\u2018The Future of Feminist Liberalism\u2019, Proceedings and Addresses of the\nAmerican Philosophical Association, 74 (2000), 47\u201379.\n4 Rawls, op. cit. 240, fn.22.\n5 Aristotle, Topics, 112a20; Politics, 1253a3.\n581\nThe Other Side of Agency\nsubject to the attentions of doctors, lying in bed in hospitals, being\noperated on or otherwise \u2018treated\u2019. For us the term \u2018patient\u2019 has mis-\nleading associations of human occurrent need, and negative connota-\ntions of a state to be avoided.Despite these difficulties, I need a term to\nrefer to the silenced and \u2018othered\u2019 passive aspects of personhood. The\nphilosophical etymology insists \u2018patient\u2019 is the right term, so that is the\nterm I will use, and I urge others to do the same.6\n2. The Agential Conception of the Person\nThe agential conception of the person takes many guises, with many\ndifferent patterns of emphasis. Most philosophers, like Charles\nTaylor, simply assume we know what we mean, and all agree, when\nwe say persons are agents. They then explore in detail only the\nparticular aspects of agential personhood that interest them. Some\nexplore rational ormoral actions, some explore persons asmoral or pol-\nitical agents, some explore the moral status of persons, others explore\nthe possibility of free will, and the implications of conclusions about\nfree will for human moral responsibility, or the best political arrange-\nments for persons. Some explore consciousness and knowledge, and\nthe contributions that agency makes to those dimensions of human\nlife. Others explore the relationships, commitments and projects that\nmay structure human life.7 In what follows, I discuss four features\nof persons as agents which I think are particularly central to the agen-\ntial conception\u2014action, capability, freedom and independence.\n6 Although I adopt Aristotle\u2019s usage and recommend it, sadly I must\nnote that Aristotle himself was not immune from the agential bias. His treat-\nment of form and matter reflects it, as does his insistence that God must be\nall action. Even the etymology of the Greek words shows a bias which was\nobviously entrenched even then: \u2018pathos\u2019 meant not just experience or suf-\nfering, but also misfortune or calamity; \u2018pasko\u2019, while it had the unbiased\nmeaning of \u2018to suffer or be affected by anything whether good or bad, as\nopposed to acting oneself\u2019, also meant to be ailing, to suffer evil or to bemis-\ntreated. The contrasting terms are positive: \u2018poeisis\u2019 meant making, doing,\nshaping, creating, or begetting; \u2018dunamis\u2019 meant strength, might or power,\nand the human \u2018ergon\u2019 is understood as consisting of \u2018actuality\u2019, which\nAristotle notes is etymologically linked to action (Metaphysics IX, 1050a20).\n7 See H. Frankfurt,The Importance ofWhat we Care About (Cambridge:\nCambridge University Press, 1988). Thanks to Marilyn Friedman for\npointing out that \u2018agential conceptions\u2019 of philosophers are more diverse\nthan I seem to suggest, extending to features I do not discuss here, like con-\nsciousness and non-rational commitments.\n582\nSoran Reader\na. Action\nA central element of the agential conception, is the idea that persons\nare beings that act. Some philosophers who take a more detailed\ninterest in human agency argue that persons are distinguished not\nmerely by action, which animals and even machines may also be\ncapable of, but by specifically personal kinds of action, for example\n\u2018intentional action\u2019.8 Others, like Fred Dretske and Mikael\nKarlsson, do discuss the broader notion of action as \u2018things we do\u2019,\ndistinguishing this from \u2018things that happen to us\u2019 by the criterion\nof self-movement.9\nBut we need to rewind, and ask more basic questions. What can we\nmean, if we say persons are beings that act? What is action, and why\nshould we believe persons are especially, or at all, characterised by\nit? Late in his career a philosopher of action, Richard Taylor,\nbecame disillusioned with the idea that we should or can think of\npersons as beings which act.10 In his succinct paper, Taylor usefully\nsums up our shared target, the view that persons as agents are a unique\nphenomenon in nature, and present a unique challenge to philosophy:\nPersons are unique, in that they sometimes act. Other things are\nmerely passive, undergoing such changes as are imparted to them,\nbut never really performing even simple actions as people do.11\nTaylor argues that this idea of action is not at all as clear, or as plau-\nsibly a central aspect of personhood, as in the grip of the agential\nconception we have tended to assume.\nTo challenge the idea that persons \u2018act\u2019 in any metaphysically dis-\ntinctive way, Taylor considers three possible accounts that might be\n8 D.Velleman, \u2018WhatHappens when Someone Acts?\u2019, inThe Possibility\nof Practical Reason, (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 2000), 123\u201343.\n9 F. Dretske, Explaining Behavior: Reasons in a World of Causes,\n(Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1988), 1; M.Karlsson, \u2018Agency and\nPatiency: Back to Nature?\u2019, Philosophical Explorations, 5 (2002), 59\u201381.\n10 R. Taylor, \u2018Agent and Patient: is there a Distinction?\u2019, Erkenntnis, 18\n(1982), 223\u2013232. Taylor reluctantly came to believe that analytic philos-\nophy of action\u2014a new and growing area, which continues to attract good\nphilosophers\u2014is riddled with mistakes.\n11 Op. cit. 223. In this paper, for simplicity, I treat thinking, judging,\nintending and willing as kinds of action. They are things that agents do,\nindeed for Kant because willing is uncontaminated by the contingencies\nof the empirical world it is the person-defining action par excellance; simi-\nlarly, for Aristotle, because it is unchangingly and perfectly active, thinking\nis the paradigmatic action. See Metaphysics XII 1072b14\u201331.\n583\nThe Other Side of Agency\ngiven of the distinctiveness of action. First, action might be a meta-\nphysically different kind of thing from causation, as the quote\nabove suggests: what a person does, and what a clock does, are differ-\nent\u2014while persons act, clocks are merely acted on and at most\nunwind.12 Taylor rejects this account, on the grounds that animals\nact, and that talk of the \u2018actions\u2019 of inanimate entities like artefacts\nis perfectly comprehensible in some situations. The second account\nTaylor considers, is that action is a kind of causation after all\u2014but\na unique kind, not found in anything except agents. Actions are self-\ncaused, while everything else in theworld is caused by other things.13\nTaylor rejects this too, on the grounds that the \u2018metaphysical self\u2019\nwhich acts in its own special and mysterious way, is an ad hoc postu-\nlate which lacks explanatory basis and internal sense.\nThe third possible account he considers, is that actions might be\ncaused \u2018in the normal way\u2019, but by special objects. This is the view\nmade popular by Donald Davidson, that actions are things caused\nby a combination of a pro-attitude towards an action, and a belief\nthat the action is of the right kind.14 This account of the specialness\nof action must also fail, in Taylor\u2019s view. The Davidsonian proposal\nmerely reprises the dilemma, it cannot solve it: either my willing is a\nspecial cause, an operation by my \u2018self\u2019 on my belief\/pro-attitude\npair, in which case we have the ad hoc postulate again. Or the\nbelief\/pro-attitude pair simply causes my action, in which case\naction is not distinctive after all. Action, Taylor concludes, cannot\nbe something metaphysically distinctive of persons. He concludes\nthat human actions and persons as agents are distinguished not by\nintrinsic features, but by the ordinary practices we use to decide\nwhat is and isn\u2019t an action or an agent when we encounter them.\nb. Ability, Capability, Power, Potential\nActual action, as it were, is not the only feature the agential con-\nception of the person makes central. As important, is capability, the\nability, power, or potential realisable by the self, to act. Thus John\nLocke defines a person in terms of things they are able to do: a\nperson is a being that \u2018can consider itself as itself\u2019, and John Rawls\n12 Op. cit. 223\u20134.\n13 Ibid.\n14 The locus classicus for Davidson\u2019s view is D. Davidson, \u2018Actions,\nReasons and Causes\u2019, Journal of Philosophy, 60 (1973), 685\u2013700. For\nTaylor\u2019s criticism, see op. cit. 229.\n584\nSoran Reader\ndefines a person as \u2018someonewho can take part in social life\u2019, who pos-\nsesses \u2018two moral powers\u2019, namely \u2018a capacity for a sense of justice and\na capacity for a conception of the good\u2019.15\nAmartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum have developed related\nconceptions of the person as characterised by capacities or \u2018capabilities\u2019\nrather than actual activities (or \u2018functionings\u2019 as they call them). Their\naims are political: they seek a conception of the person that will facili-\ntate social justice. Nussbaum draws inspiration from Aristotle. On her\nreading, human beings have some capabilities in virtue of being the\nnatural kind of being which has the power, potential or capability to\nbecome some specific thing. She calls these \u2018B [for basic] capabilities\u2019,\nand refers to Aristotle\u2019s description of a child as having a potential\nor power in this sense to become a general.16 Such capabilities,\nNussbaum argues, ground claims to political distribution to facilitate\nthe \u2018I [internal]\u2019 and \u2018E [external condition]\u2019 capabilities to become\nthe specific thing, for example the teaching of skills and removal of\nexternal constraints.17\nSen\u2019s focus on capabilities reflects hiswish as an economist to steer a\nmiddle course avoiding the paternalism of objective-good approaches,\nand the problem of adaptive preferences of subjective-well-being or\npreference-based accounts of what people have political claim to.\nThe feature he thus emphasises about capability is less prominent\nin Nussbaum\u2019s account: freedom. A capability is a freedom. It is\nnot just a potential, then\u2014it is a potential which can be actualised,\nor can be left un-actualised by the agent\u2019s choice. This brings us to\na third feature central to the agential conception.\nc. Choice, Rationality, Freedom\nAccording to the agential conception, a person is not just a being that\ndoes and can, a person is a being that chooses to do what it does, and\nchooses which abilities to develop and which to leave undeveloped,\nand chooses which of its developed abilities to exercise and when.\nThe concept of choice is closely related to the concepts of rationality\nand freedom. A person is capable of choice, not in the sense of being\n15 J. Locke, Essay Concerning HumanUnderstanding (London: Thomas\nTegg, 1846), Bk. 2, ch. 27, s. 9, 217; J.

This means the free choosing person is implicitly\nassumed to be able to know the options, to be able to contemplate\nthem in thought, to deliberate over them, and to elect an option to\nact on for reasons. To be able to choose in this way, is to be free.\nKant\u2019s definition of the moral person highlights this aspect of the\nagential conception:\nMoral personality is nothing but the freedom of a rational being\nunder moral laws . . . Hence it follows that a person is subject to\nno other laws than those which he (either alone or jointly with\nothers) gives to himself.18\nThis identification of personhood with free rational choosing can be\nelaborated in dramatic ways. Margaret Walker discusses three such\nelaborations.19 According to the first, a person is a being with a\n\u2018rational plan of life\u2019, as JohnRawls has proposed.20Walker questions\nRawls\u2019 idea. Ordinary people in most circumstances cannot and\ndo not live according to life plans.21 According to the second,\nwhich Walker finds in Bernard Williams, a person is a being who\nis stably disposed to practical deliberation which is given direction\nby character, understood as structured by \u2018constitutive projects\u2019\nwhich answer \u2018the question of why we go on at all\u2019.22 Walker\nobjects on empirical grounds: it is \u2018a questionable claim, that\nhaving character at all requires having literally life-driving,\nmake-or-break commitments\u2019.23\nAccording to the third way, which Walker finds in Charles Taylor,\nthe central role of choice, rationality and freedom is elaborated by\nequating \u2018selfhood itself with having and sustaining a whole-life nar-\nrative\u2019, as Taylor does.24 Walker finds this view \u2018vastly demanding\u2019.\nWalker\u2019s criticisms of these versions of the agential conception are\n18 I.

She has not \u2018argued for or against. . . autonomous\nman, the career self, as a moral paradigm of a \u201cperson\u201d\u2019, but more\nmodestly, \u2018against. . . presenting this richly specific ideal as a thin\nbut necessary idea of what persons, selves, or human agents\n\u201care\u201d\u2019.25 The view I will defend below, is that stronger conclusions\nmay be warranted: autonomous man and the career self are\nexpressions of an agential bias which is not so much \u2018richly specific\u2019\nas mistaken and even pernicious.\nd. Independence\nThe features of the agential conception I have considered up to now\u2014\naction, capability and free rational choice\u2014are implicitly committed\nto another idea about persons which deserves critical attention. This\nis the idea that persons are independent. In acting, the person as agent\nis meant to be independent in the sense that nothing else causes their\naction. In being thought of as capable, again, the agent is being\nthought of as in a position and condition where their own decision\nis sufficient to actualise the capability. And in free rational choice,\nagain, the agent is thought as paradigmatically not constrained by\nothers, not in need of others to think and know, nor inhibited or dis-\ntracted by others in choosing.\nAre these claims about the independence of persons plausible? The\nidea of independence is much more demanding than most people,\neven most philosophers, tend to recognise. It is so demanding that\nSpinoza concluded there could only be one independent being, the\nworld (nature naturata) or God (nature naturans) referred to under\nits passive and its active aspect respectively. This implies that when\nsupporters of the agential conception say persons are \u2018independent\u2019,\nthey cannot mean this in any strong sense. But if persons are not\nindependent in that strong Spinozist sense towards which supporters\nof the agential conception perhaps unconsciously yearn, in what\nsense, exactly, can they be independent at all? As Richard Taylor\nfound with action, a notion we thought was clear collapses on quite\na cursory analysis.26\n25 Op. cit. 152.\n26 This brief criticism of the idea that persons are \u2018independent\u2019 might\nlead readers to wonder whether the well-known \u2018free will debate\u2019 in analytic\nphilosophy might be useful here. Although I cannot argue for this here, my\nview is that because the \u2018debate\u2019 is grounded in conceptions of nature and\ncausation, my point about the inalienability of dependency cannot be\n587\nThe Other Side of Agency\n3. Passivity on the Other Side of Activity\nEach of the features of the agential conception of persons I have high-\nlighted has an \u2018other side\u2019, a complementary aspect which necessarily\naccompanies the aspect valorised as \u2018positive\u2019 and assumed to furnish\nthe essence or form of what it is to be a person. Making only the\nmodest assumption that persons are not omnipotent Gods, I will\nargue that these \u2018negative\u2019 aspects are misunderstood when they are\ntreated as alternatives to agency, fallings away or privations. They\nare not regrettable lapses, which philosophers seeking to understand\nthe person can reasonably ignore. In human beings, these \u2018negative\u2019\nfeatures are necessarily presupposed by the \u2018positive\u2019 agential features\nI have described.\na. Action\/Passion\nAction presupposes passion, doings involve sufferings. This is so in\nat least two senses. In the first sense, it is necessarily true of the\nagent as such that when and as they act, they suffer. When I act,\nin that action itself, I the agent suffer. When I hit you, I suffer\nyour resistance to the blow. When I lift a cup to my lips, I suffer\nits weight. I do not suffer my action under its unifying descrip-\ntion\u2014when I hit you, I do not hit myself, when I lift the cup, I\ndo not lift myself. But my action is nevertheless essentially partly\nconstituted by my suffering. My hitting you includes as an essential\nelement your bodily resistance; my lifting the cup essentially\nincludes my suffering the weight of the cup in my hand. If I do\nnot suffer that resistance or that weight, I have not done that action.\nIn the second sense, it is necessarily true of any action that when it\nis done, some being, the patient, suffers it. When I hit you, you\nsuffer, and your suffering essentially partly constitutes my action.\nWhen I lift my cup, I suffer a cup at my lips. If you are not hit,\nI have not hit you. If I do not suffer the cup at my lips, I have not\nlifted the cup. Actions always and as such have patients, beings\nwhich the action affects. The patient is the being at the receiving\ncaptured or illuminated by it. For discussion of how our conception of\nnature has been distorted, see J.McDowell, \u2018Two Sorts of Naturalism\u2019,\nVirtues and Reasons, R. Hursthouse, G. Lawrence and W. Quinn (Eds.)\n(Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995), 149\u2013180.\n588\nSoran Reader\nend, acted on when the agent acts. For every action, there is both an\nagent and a patient.\nThese twin facts of patiency\u2014that as agents we suffer as we act,\nand that as patients we suffer in being acted on\u2014are inalienable,\npervasive and important in the social life of human beings. In a\ncommunity of persons, we all suffer as we act, and we all suffer\nas other persons act on us. Of course we also act on, and suffer\nthe actions of, non-personal things in the world. Whenever we\nact, we and our patients are affected. Our agency is accompanied\nby patiency\u2014an agent will always also be a patient, now in one\nrespect in acting, now in another respect being acted on by\nanother. Persons, this suggests, must be as much patients as they\nare agents. Far from being a privation of personhood, patiency is\nactually a doubly inalienable part of personhood. There is no con-\nceptual or metaphysical reason to doubt that what we suffer as\npatients, in acting and in being acted on, may define us as much\nas what we do as agents.\nIt has been suggested that an even stronger no-priority viewmay be\nmetaphysically well-grounded, which would dispense with the\nagent\/patient distinction altogether. C.B. Martin argues that in our\nexplanations we should dispense with \u2018unhelpful distinctions such\nas power to give vs. power to receive, agent vs. patient, active vs.\npassive, causal conditions vs. standing conditions\u2019. Instead, he\nargues, \u2018whatever is causally operative should have its full status as\nreciprocal dispositional partner for a mutual manifestation\u2019.27\nWhilst I welcome Martin\u2019s point that a distinction of this type\ncannot be \u2018metaphysically deep\u2019, and especially welcome the\nsupport this implies for my view that the agency cannot be metaphy-\nsically \u2018prior to\u2019 or \u2018more important than\u2019 patiency in the constitution\nof persons, I think it aids understanding to keep the distinction, for\nexample to illuminate issues of harm, benefit and responsibility.\nb. Capability\/Liability\nCapabilities and powers similarly presuppose passive features. This is\nso in the simple sense that an ability to act is always also a liability to\nsuffer, so that to be able to lift objects is to be liable to be confined by\nwalls. It is also so in the sense that to be able to do one thing, is to be\n27 C.B.Martin, \u2018On theNeed for Properties\u2019,Synthese, 112 (1997), 204.\nThanks to Jonathan Lowe for drawingmy attention toMartin\u2019s work on this\ntopic.\n589\nThe Other Side of Agency\nunable to do another. Pace superwoman, when I am truly able to\nwrite a philosophy paper, I am unable to clean my house.\nHuman capabilities and powers also refer to incapacities and vul-\nnerabilities. To be able to write a philosophy paper is to have been\nunable to do so, and to be vulnerable to losing the ability. To have\namoral power to act from a conception of the good, is to be vulnerable\nto act badly from a distorted conception of the good, and to be vulner-\nable to being held to account before such a conception, good or\nskewed. Eva Kittay reminds us of this two-edged aspect of capability\nwhen she compares the moral worth of two people, her daughter\nSesha who lacks many capabilities but is a good person, and the\nNazi doctors who were unfortunately extremely capable, but did a\nvast amount of harm.28\nc. Freedom\/Constraint; Choice\/Necessity; Rationality\/Contingency\nFreedom and choice have an other side too. To be free in one respect\nis to be constrained in another.When I freely talk with you, I am con-\nstrained by the common grammar of our language. When I choose\nwhich school to send my child to, I am constrained by the schools\non offer, my knowledge and understanding of schooling and my\ndaughter, and my ability or willingness to tolerate the costs of\ncertain choices. I am also, of course, constrained by more or less\nevident influences acting on me (my past experience, what my\nfriends, colleagues and family say to me, news stories, other stories,\nadvertising, accidental but powerful encounters with some or other\naspects of the school).\nIn human persons rationality, too, thought of as it usually is on the\nintellectualist paradigm of deliberation and choice for reasons, has an\nother side. To apprehend some reasons is to fail to apprehend others,\nto deliberate is to leave out things that might matter, and the end of\nthe process of deliberation is always necessarily incomplete and there-\nfore subject to numerous contingencies outside deliberative scope.29\nThe special importance philosophers give to rational deliberation also\n2 8 E. Kittay, \u2018At theMargins ofMoral Personhood\u2019,Ethics, 116 (2005),\n100\u2013131, 123.\n29 SeeWittgenstein\u2019s treatment of rule-following, andMcDowell\u2019s dis-\ncussion of its importance, for elaboration of this idea about the necessary and\nintrinsic limits to rationalism for ethics, in L. Wittgenstein, Philosophical\nInvestigations (Oxford: Blackwell, 1953) and J. McDowell, \u2018Virtue and\nReason\u2019, Monist, 62 (1979).\n590\nSoran Reader\nattests to the fact that this is an ideal, and as such surely not apt to be\ndefining of, normal for, ordinary people as such.30\nd. Independence\/Dependency\nWhat of independence, which seems to me to be somehow at the core\nof the agential conception? If we insist, against the powerful Spinozist\nargument that independence is a chimera, that there is a sense in\nwhich persons are independent, we will be forced to acknowledge\nthat such \u2018independence\u2019 is only ever partial, and is woven, when it\nis, from multiple dependencies. The dependencies presupposed by\nthe very idea of independence are total, or abject, in the sense that\nthe agent is truly helpless in relation to them, as helpless as those para-\ndigms of weakness and vulnerability, the kitten or the newborn baby.\nThe \u2018independence\u2019 of persons as agents depends, in the here and\nnow alone, on a healthy body, muscles, a skeleton, enough space, sur-\nfaces on which to act, light, air and water, enough food and drink,\nfreedom from illness, injury, infection or other disruption of the\norganism. Looking beyond the here, the \u2018independent\u2019 ability to\nact also requires that the earth be turning, the sun be energising the\nearth, no asteroids, comets, nuclear bombs, earthquakes, tidal\nwaves, massive solar flares or other large-scale disasters be occurring.\nLooking beyond the now, the independence of persons depends on a\nlong history of worldly support, including in addition to all the\nfactors above maternal gestation and care, family and social\nsupport, education, economic and political resources. Against this\nbackground of total dependency, it is surprising that the idea of the\n\u2018independent agent\u2019 ever got off the ground, let alone came to struc-\nture our very concept of what it is to be a person.\n30 Of course a defender of this aspect of the agential conception might\nsay that an ideal is an essence. Aristotle did say this in the final book of\nthe Nicomachean Ethics, where he recommended that everyone should\naspire to the life of contemplation\u2014that is, the constant pure exercise of\nrationality\u2014because it is the highest thing in us. But we can question this,\non Aristotelian grounds. If the aim of our philosophy is to tell the truth\nabout human beings and decide how their lives should best be ordered,\nwe should attend not just to what a small group of elite thinkers (some-\ntimes\u2014when their abilities are not exercised in corrupt ways, as for\nexample Heidegger\u2019s and Althusser\u2019s were, not to mention Kittay\u2019s Nazi\ndoctors) do, but as much to what ordinary people do in the course of\nliving ordinary lives. For an example of making the ordinary central, see\nV. Das, Life and Words:Violence and the Descent into the Ordinary\n(Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007).\n591\nThe Other Side of Agency\n4. A Balanced Conception of the Person as Patient and Agent\nI think the agential conception of persons is mistaken. It arises not\nfrom study of persons as they actually are, but rather from a bias\ntowards the active and powerful which has complex political origins\nI can\u2019t explore here. The agential conception is not just mistaken, it\nis also harmful. To correct the mistake and remedy the harms it has\ncaused, we need to integrate the non-agential aspects of our life\ninto our concept of the person. We need to recognise and dignify\nthe non-agential aspects of life, in ourselves and in others.\nOn the balanced view I suggest we should prefer, passivity,\ninability, necessity\/contingency and dependency are as constitutive\nof personhood as the \u2018positive\u2019 aspects of action, capability, choice\nand independence which according to the agential conception are\nnecessary and sufficient for personhood on their own. Along with\nagency comes patiency. Along with capabilities, come inabilities.\nAlongwith freedom, choice, and rationality come constraint, necessity\nand contingency. And along with independence come dependencies.\nIt would represent real progress, both philosophical and political,\nif these features of human subjectivity could be recognised for what\nthey are\u2014aspects of full, complex personhood\u2014rather than treated\nas privations of personhood which philosophers and politicians can\nignore, or marginalise and deplore. Passivity, inability, necessity\nand dependency are essentially connected with the agential features,\njust as receptivity is essentially connected with spontanaeity in\nexperience and knowledge. When we think of an action, in that\nsame thought we think of a passion or experience. The two aspects,\nwhich we might call generally active and passive, are inseparable,\nincapable of independent existence. The philosophical and political\nproblem is that the agential conception has encouraged us to ignore\nthe non-agential aspects of personhood.\nHow should this be put right? In the rest of this paper I make some\nsuggestions about howwemight begin to re-balance the agential con-\nception, exploring some of the ways in which non-agential aspects of\nlife can plausibly be said to be fundamental and constitutive of what it\nis for anyone to be a person.\na. Patients\nAs well as being persons and expressing our personhood when we act,\nwe are persons and we manifest our personhood when we are patients.\nAs I pointed out above, agents suffer when they act, and they also\n592\nSoran Reader\nsuffer the actions of other persons and things in the world. When\nAristotle distinguishes man from other animals, the way he does this\ncan be read as avoiding the agential bias\u2014he says man is an animal\n\u2018able to receive knowledge\u2019.31 To receive something is of course to be\npassive with respect to it, to be acted on by it. And \u2018knowledge\u2019 is a\nvery broad concept, covering all kinds of experience, from knowledge\nof maths equations, to knowledge of what it is like to be tortured or\nmade a scapegoat or pariah by your community.\nPersons are patients when they are acted on. It is worth stressing\nthat \u2018patient\u2019 does not mean \u2018object\u2019. It is as if supporters of the agen-\ntial conception conflate these two things, and assume that to be a\npatient is to cease to be a human subject altogether\u2014to cease to be\na knower, a thinker, a moral being. The agent\/patient distinction is\nnot the same as a the subject\/object distinction.32 When I am a\npatient, I am not thereby an object, but remain as much of a\nsubject, a human person, as I am when I act.\nReflection free of the agential bias reveals that we are patients what-\never else we are, all the time. The same reflection should also reveal\nthat being a patient all the time is not as such a reduced or unpleasant\ncondition\u2014which is just as well, if I am right that it is also an una-\nvoidable condition. I am a patient not just when I am being treated\nby doctors in hospital, but also when I use the world\u2019s resistances\nto speak, and when I take my turn to be quiet and listen in a conver-\nsation. I am a patient not just when I \u2018lie back and think of England\u2019\nas a fumbling lover makes use of my body, but also when I experience\nmy own lovemaking, and whenmy partner makesmore engaging love\nto me. I am a patient not just when I am shot at in a battle, but also\nwhen I suffer the kick of my own gun, and when I follow the\norders of my commander. I am a patient not just when I am given\na bed-bath, but also when I dive into a lake, and when I am caught\nin a downpour. I am a patient not just when I am carried along\nagainst my will, but also when I enthusiastically slide down a water-\nfall, or let myself be carried to the shore by a wave.\nI am fully alive, fully human while I am a patient. There is\nnothing\u2014except millennia of prejudice and fear\u2014in the idea of\npatiency as such, to suggest that it is a mode in which we are less our-\nselves, less persons, when we identify ourselves as patients in these\nordinary ways. Indeed, plausibly we may even be more ourselves,\nmore the person that we are, as patients, because we are not distracted\n31 Topics 112b20.\n32 Thanks to Bill Pollard for suggesting that contrasting these two dis-\ntinctions might be helpful.\n593\nThe Other Side of Agency\nfrom the experience of presence to self by activity, by the effort of\nacting on things and persons in the world. Parmenides\u2019 ancient\nvision of being as an unchanging, complete unity has traces of this\ninsight that being is in a sense passive, andHannahArendt\u2019s evocative\nidea of conscience as the presence of self-to-self away from the distrac-\ntions of persons and other goings on also hints that there is much\nrichness in the idea of subjectivity when it is precisely not active.33\nThe one place in philosophy where this idea is familiar is epistem-\nology.We accept as unremarkable the idea that persons as knowers are\npassive. Our very concept of \u2018world\u2019 which knowers know is of some-\nthing that is given to or inflicted on us, towhich we are passive, which\nwe must notice, recognise, acknowledge grasp, understand, accept. If\npersonhood as passive is accepted in epistemology, why not in meta-\nphysics, ethics and politics too? If as knowers we are patients, surely\nthis shows passivity as such cannot be a dubious or avoidable thing,\nand opens the way to an exploration of other patiential aspects of\npersonhood.\nMore attention to epistemology may help illuminate this puzzle.\nSince Kant, and arguably long before that, the necessity of an agential\ncontribution to experience and knowledge has been recognised.34 To\nbe knowers, we must make sense of what is given. It is not enough\nunknowingly tomanifest the fact, as boilingwater unknowinglymani-\nfests the fact that it is hot. Using our concepts\u2014our \u2018understanding\u2019,\nfor Kant, the active complement of our \u2018sensibility\u2019\u2014is theway we do\nthis. \u2018Intuitions [like the experience of hotwater] without concepts are\nblind\u2019, as Kant and more recently John McDowell have emphasised.\nBut equally, \u2018concepts [like the idea of heat] without intuitions [like\nthe experience of hot water] are empty\u2019, as Kant famously put these\nthoughts.35 Translated into the language of agent and patient, we\nmight say \u2018passion without action is blind\u2019 and \u2018action without\npassion is empty\u2019. Just as there can be no knowledge without\npassive experience, perhaps also there can be no action without suffer-\ning, and no agency and thus no personhood without patiency.\nBut while arguments for the interdependence of spontanaeity and\nreceptivity in epistemology may seem to help me establish the\ninalienable necessity of both agency and patiency to a correct\n33 H.

McDowell, Mind and World (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard\nUniversity Press, 1996.\n594\nSoran Reader\nconception of the person, such arguments may also help to explain\nwhy the point about the inalienability of passivity implied by the\nfact of knowledge has not been much more widely taken. As well as\nbeing an insight, Kant and others\u2019 insistence on the contribution of\nspontanaeity to knowledge can also be read as a symptom of the agen-\ntial conception. The idea that as knowers persons might truly be\npassive, subject to that given Other, the world, might so have horri-\nfied these thinkers, that they protested a role for spontanaeity mainly\nto avoid acknowledgement of subjectedness. If this is right, it is no\nsurprise that in other areas where a conception of the person\nappears, the connection between activity and passivity protested in\nepistemology is not mentioned, let alone insisted on.\nAs patients, persons are also victims, that is patients of a specific\ntype of action, harm. Harm is damage or injury. Human action that\naims to harm is violence. As victims, persons suffer in the negative\nsense of experiencing misfortune or calamity. This aspect of non-\nagential human being is particularly morally and politically import-\nant, and generally philosophers are sensitive to this. But philosophical\nefforts in ethics and politics, again perhaps reflecting the agential bias,\ntend to focus on the bad that is doneby the perpetrator, and onwhatwe\nthe bystanders should do, either to the perpetrator to punish or\nprevent him, or more generally to prevent such harms in future. If\nthe victim appears, they will typically be objectified, and the moral\nquestions will be limited to what harm they have suffered, and what\nwe can do to restore them to full personhood, that is, to agency.36\nThe implicit denial of personhood to victims by our analytical\nstance\u2014the suggestion that when you are a victim, you are less a\nperson\u2014compounds the harm suffered by victims. It is bad enough\nto be tortured. It is even worse, while you are suffering to find no rec-\nognition of your personhood in your community, but encounter\ninstead a refusal to identify with you and show solidarity with you as\na victim. In the grip of the agential conception, with all its prejudice\nand fear, our communities shun victims, press them to hide the\ndamage they have suffered, to say nothing about the horrors they\nknow, and to \u2018recover\u2019 their humanity by \u2018getting past\u2019 their victim-\nhood and identifying as \u2018survivors\u2019\u2014that is, again, as agents.\n36 See S. Reader \u2018After 9\/11: Making Pacifism Plausible\u2019, Pazifismus,\nB. Bleisch, J-D. Strub (Eds.) (Bern: Haupt, 2006, 205\u2013221, esp. 205\u2013210,\nfor a sketch of the differences it might make if we instead of analysing\nmoral contexts (for example harms caused by violence) from a \u2018perpetrator-\ncentred\u2019, \u2018bystander\u2019 perspective, we approached them from a \u2018patient-\ncentred\u2019 perspective.\n595\nThe Other Side of Agency\nIt is ethically and politically important to notice how the denial of\nvictimhood impacts asymmetrically on the two sexes. Because\nwomen are more often and more completely victims, the personhood\nof more women is denied when our culture as a whole operates with\nthe unbalanced agential conception. Actual and threatened violence,\nand standing vulnerability to violence, from stronger males (includ-\ning harassment, pornography, battery, rape and forced gestation\nand motherhood), the facts of coercion and the facts of economic\ndependency, structure what it is for a woman to be a person.37\nWomen are also socialised to be more passive than men, more\naccepting of male violence than men are of female violence, and\nmore disposed to respond to violence with care and compassion than\nto counter-attack, judge or punish. They are thus more likely to be,\nand so to see themselves as, victims. Some feminists argue that we\nshould refuse to think of women as victims. I think this amounts to\nan endorsement of the moral values that underpin the agential con-\nception, abandons suffering women and compounds the harm to\nthem. The agential conception conceptualises victimhood as a\nfailure, a falling-short of full humanity. When Naomi Wolf, for\nexample, attacks \u2018victim-feminism\u2019, and exhorts women to identify\ninstead as \u2018power-feminists\u2019, she is colluding in this denial.38 It is a\nshort step from discouraging (female) persons from identifying as\nvictims, to shifting the blame for the fact of victimhood onto those\nwho state the fact frankly, as for example Carole Vance seems to do:\nIf women . . . view themselves entirely as victims. . .and allow them-\nselves to be viewed that way by others, they become enfeebled and\nmiserable.39\nThis has a disastrous moral and political effect as victims themselves,\nmany more women than men, are denied. It is as if even for their\nchampions, victims as such are not subjects, do not know, do not\ncount, do not have anything to contribute to society except the frigh-\ntening spectre of pain and disarray which by its very presence suggests\nthe ominous truth that \u2018this could be you\u2019, and an unbearable whining\nsound which must be shut out at all costs.\n37 A dramatic rhetorical way to draw attention to this issue, is simply to\npose the question, \u2018are women human?\u2019 under the agential conception.\nSee C. Mackinnon, Are Women Human? (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard\nUniversity Press, 2006).\n38 N. Wolf, Fire with Fire (New York: Fawcett, 1994).\n39 C. Vance, \u2018Pleasure and Danger: Towards a Politics of Sexuality\u2019,\nPleasure and Danger (London: Pandora, 1992), 7.\n596\nSoran Reader\nBut from the point of view of a balanced conception of the person,\nit emerges quite clearly that the personal perspective of victims is\nindispensable. Recognising and living with ourselves and each\nother as patients and victims is a condition for the sane living of\nany actual human life. It is also necessary for any complete under-\nstanding of the human person, and for the task of achieving more\njust social arrangements. Susan Brison, in her remarkable book\nAftermath, tackles this issue. She looks outside the blinkers of the\nagential conception, and offers a unique first-personal and philoso-\nphical exploration of what it means for a person to be a victim of pro-\nfound harm, what sense if any can be attached to the idea of \u2018recovery\u2019\nafter such harm, and what identity and knowledge can mean once the\nreality of harm, violence and suffering is fully acknowledged.40\nFrom well-known but philosophically unanalysed and disre-\nspected female responses to violence, we can learn something of phi-\nlosophical importance about persons and their possibilities. It is a\ncliche\u00b4 in our culture, that there are two responses to violence and\ndanger, fight or flight. It is a cliche\u00b4, but it is false, and attention to\nthe lived reality of women\u2019s lives reveals this. Women facing violence\noften neither fight nor flee, but instead endure the violence. They\nprotect themselves and the everyday life of those near to them from\nit as best they can, and they try to get the perpetrator to stop in non-\nviolent ways. Violence against women and children is common to the\npoint of normality all over the world. The misogynistic ideas that in\nsuch situations women endure violence because they get pleasure\nfrom it as masochists, or because they have fallen away from full\nrational agential personhood, graphically show how the agential con-\nception here constricts our understanding of victims as persons, and\ndeprives them of recognition and help.\nWomen may endure violence in part because it is often not in their\npower to flee or fight. The idea that either fight or flight must always\nbe possible is one of the fantasies of the agential conception. A power-\nful enough perpetrator cannot be escaped, and he cannot be beaten in\na fight. As well as himself being stronger, more determined, cleverer,\nfreer of responsibilities to dependent others, the perpetrator may also\nbenefit from having the whole human world on his side and against\nhis victim, blaming her. What option, in such a situation, is left for\na person? Endurance is the only option. It is not action, it does not\nshow positive capability, it is not chosen or independent.\nNevertheless, it is a way to be a person in adversity. Far from being\nan easy or self-deluded option, endurance is difficult and courageous.\n40 S. Brison, Aftermath (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2002).\n597\nThe Other Side of Agency\nWhile it is passive, it is also fully present and alive. When as persons\nwe endure, we see and we learn. We witness, we learn deep truths\nabout violence and perpetrators. Victims\u2019 patient endurance of vio-\nlence, and their culture\u2019s subsequent careful attention to them,\ntaking them seriously as persons, listening to them and engaging\nwith them, is a necessary step to understanding harm, helping\nvictims and preventing and remedying harm.\nIn Life and Words Veena Das describes some of the ways particular\nwomen endured extreme multiple violences of loss of homeland,\nabduction, rape, forced motherhood and then reverse abduction to\n\u2018restore\u2019 the male-centred nation from which they had been \u2018stolen\u2019.\nDas records some profound metaphors women have used for their\nendurance. They called it \u2018drinking all pain\u2019 and \u2018digesting the\npoison\u2019.41 The endurance of women seems to have at least two\naspects, factual and practical. \u2018Drinking the poison\u2019 suggests taking\nin factual knowledge revealed through the victim\u2019s unique epistemic\nperspective on perpetrators and the horrors they are responsible for.\nAs factual knowledge, such \u2018poison\u2019 demands to be articulated,\nspoken, presented as a challenge of truth to (male) power and violence.\nBut \u2018digesting the poison\u2019 suggests metabolising, neutralising, con-\ntaining or living with the violence, so that human life can continue,\nor even begin again when it has been utterly laid waste. In enduring,\nwhen women as victims \u2018digest the poison\u2019, they contain and process\nthe terrible facts, to make the world safely livable for themselves,\ntheir families, their children, their communities, and even perpetrators\nthemselves.Women here have a practical knowledge of how tomanifest\nlife between violence and the things they love. Their endurance absorbs\nthe violence, as a harbour wall absorbs the forces of the sea. Das\u2019s study\nsuggests that many victims believe that far from demanding to be\nspoken, the knowledge that informs this aspect of endurance demands\nsilence, so that ordinary life can continue, or begin again, amid the\nrubble that violence has created.\nb. Incapability and Need42\nOne of the arguments Amartya Sen gave for making the idea of capa-\nbility fundamental to personhood for purposes of social justice, in\nplace of the idea of need, was as follows:\n41 Das op. cit. 54\u20138, 101.\n42 In this section I recall arguments from S. Reader, \u2018Does a Basic Needs\nApproach Need Capabilities?\u2019, Journal of Political Philosophy, 14 (2006),\n337\u2013350, 343\u20136.\n598\nSoran Reader\n\u2018Needs\u2019 is a more passive concept than \u2018capability\u2019. . . the perspec-\ntive of positive freedom links naturally with capabilities (what\ncan the person do?) rather than with the fulfillment of their needs\n(what can be done for the person?). The perspective of fulfilling\nneeds has some obvious advantages in dealing with dependents\n(e.g. children), but for responsible adults the format of capabilities\nmay be much more suitable.43\nAre Sen and to a lesser extent Martha Nussbaum right, that\nthinking of persons as capable rather than as needy is metaphysically\naccurate, or politically sensible? Is Sen right to think that we canmake\nthe distinction between capability and need in terms of activity\/pas-\nsivity? To think need is a passive state, Sen must take \u2018need\u2019 to mean\ntwo things which are independent of it. Having needs, in itself, is not\na passive state. As I argued above, persons have needs under every\nagential aspect of their being. They have needs in order to act, in\norder to be capable, in order to make rational free choices, and in\norder to have such independencies as they can.\nHaving needs, far from being the exceptional and distasteful\nstate implied by the agential conception, is actually the normal\ncondition of every contingent being in the universe\u2014including\nagents, and persons as agents. If need per se is not passive, then,\nwhat makes a particular need, or a particular needing being,\npassive? Two things are needed. First, for a need to make its\nbearer passive with respect to it, in addition to being the kind of\nthing that has this kind of need\u2014as persons have a need for air,\nfor example\u2014a need must also be occurrent\u2014that is, the object\nof need must currently be lacking. I am not made passive, helpless\nor vulnerable by my dispositional need for air if I have plenty of it.\nIf, however, my need becomes occurrent, that is, I am deprived of\nair, then, yes indeed, I am passive with respect to that privation\n(and probably increasingly incapable with respect to other things\ntoo, as the lack of oxygen begins to affect my brain).\nSecond, to make its bearer passive a need must also be one which\nthe needing being cannot meet for themselves. Even if my need is\noccurrent, if I can meet the need for myself, I am not passive.\nIndeed, it is hard to think of a more active condition, than the con-\ndition in which I have an occurrent vital need which I can meet for\nmyself. If I am deprived of air, but can find a way to break the\nwindow that is coming between me and my air supply, I am about\n43 A. Sen, Resources, Values and Development (Oxford: Blackwell, 1984),\n514.\n599\nThe Other Side of Agency\nas active as I will ever be (and probably a lot more active than I would\nlike to be). Every person, qua agent as much as qua patient, has needs.\nBut only some of them are ever occurrent and unmeetable by the\nneedy person themselves. Speaking philosophically strictly, the\ndeprived have no more needs than the wealthy, children no more\nneeds than adults, and sick people no more needs than healthy.\nThe differences come in how many of the needs are occurrent, and\nin how far the needy can meet their own needs.\nIf need per se is not a passive state, Sen\u2019s main reason for preferring\nan account of persons in terms of their capabilities rather than their\nneeds is undermined. It is an interesting question, given the fairly\nobvious ineradicable fact of need, and the associated universal\nhuman vulnerability to occurrent needs we cannot meet, why thin-\nkers like Sen and Nussbaum seem to want to conceal human vulner-\nability to helplessness and dependence behind brave talk of\ncapability. I think the agential conception of persons is what explains\nthis move away from talk of need to talk of capability. John O\u2019Neill\ndraws on Adam Smith to make a related suggestion.44 Smith\ndescribes an association that is uncritically accepted in Western\nculture, between occurrent need and humiliation, and suggests this\nmotivates denial of our intrinsic neediness, and the shunning of the\nneedy which is typical of so much of our social life and, alas, of our\nphilosophical accounts of the person.\nc. Choice, Freedom, Rationality\nHow might the centrality of choice, freedom and rationality be tem-\npered in a more balanced conception of the person, free of agential\nbias? Well, the complement of choice is necessity. We need to\nacknowledge that much of what persons do and are has little to do\nwith choice in the sense philosophers have tended to be interested\nin. When I need to eat, I do not have a choice. When my sick\nparents need me, I do not have a choice. When I am tortured, I do\nnot have a choice. When I become pregnant and have no access to\nabortion, I do not \u2018choose\u2019 the path my life then takes. But in these\nparts of human life, nothing could be further from the truth than\nthe idea that what I go through and how I respond is somehow less\npersonal, less expressive and determinative of me, than what I do\nout of free rational choice.\n44 J. O\u2019Neill, \u2018Need, Humiliation and Independence\u2019, The Philosophy of\nNeed, S.Reader (Ed.) (Cambridge: CambridgeUniversity Press, 2005), 73\u201398.\n600\nSoran Reader\nA balanced philosophical account of the person might start by\nacknowledging that in much if not most of life we do not choose,\nand that, indeed, the application of choice to some aspects of life\nmakes no sense. I do not choose to be a woman, a member of a\ncertain race and class with a certain historical position. I do not\neven choose to be an agent, to be capable, to be a rational chooser\nor to be independent. But I should not be said by anyone to be less\nof a person because my life is governed by necessity, even if the\nlives of others may seem to be less constrained, less structured by\nnecessity and the forces of contingency.\nMargaret Walker\u2019s thoughtful exploration of the moral aspects of\nlife when it is not taken to be structured by freedom, choice and\nreason is encouraging.45 Walker\u2019s study reveals there is plenty of\nmoral and political importance to say about how good persons charac-\nteristically deal with constraints, act out of necessity rather than\nchoice, and are typically guided less by rationality than by relation-\nships, thoroughly contingent but necessary patterns and practices\nof concern and response. But it is not clear to me that Walker has\nentirely escaped the frame of the agential conception. While she\nhelps us to challenge especially demanding versions of the agential\nconception, like the \u2018career self\u2019, some passages seem still to be\ncommitted to the idea that persons must be some kind of agent\u2014\nthat \u2018free agency\u2019 is fundamental, if not quite equivalent, to self- or\nperson-hood.46\nd. Dependency\nThe idea that dependency has significance for persons has begun\nto be explored, notably by Eva Kittay.47 Kittay, like Rawls, Sen\nand Nussbaum, is after a political conception of the person which\nwill foster social justice. She criticises Rawls\u2019 conception of the\nperson because it fails to recognise the facts of dependency.\nEvery capable person, Kittay points out, in addition to posses-\nsing the two moral powers Rawls makes central (a capacity for\nmoral judgement and a capacity to form a conception of the\ngood) is \u2018some mother\u2019s child\u2019.48 This is to say that every\n45 Walker, op. cit.\n46 Op. cit. 196.\n47 E. Kittay, Love\u2019s Labor (New York: Routledge, 1999).\n48 Kittay, 1999, op. cit. 25.\n601\nThe Other Side of Agency\npersons as such has depended, to become what they are, on the\ncare work of another (their mother). This in turn entails that\nevery person is obliged to respect the work of care, by ensuring\nin designing the basic structure of society, that its necessary con-\nditions are met. On Kittay\u2019s view, two things must be built into\nany defensible social contract: dependents must be cared for, and\n\u2018secondary dependents\u2019, those who must care for dependents,\nmust be enabled to do their work of care. This fundamental pol-\nitical requirement for support for carers Kittay calls \u2018the principle\nof doulia\u2019, using the Greek word for female slave to allude to a\nmore specific necessary job, that of caring for a woman who\nhas just had a baby.49\nMartha Nussbaum has objected to Kittay\u2019s view that it makes\ndependency too central:\nTo be sure, nobody is ever self-sufficient; the independence we\nenjoy is always both temporary and partial, and it is good to be\nreminded of that fact by a theory that also stresses the\nimportance of care in times of dependency. But is being \u2018some\nmother\u2019s child\u2019 a sufficient image for the citizen in a just society?\nI think we need a lot more: liberty and opportunity, the chance\nto form a plan of life, the chance to learn and imagine on one\u2019s\nown.50\nNussbaum seems to reveal allegiance to the agential conception\nhere. She sees dependency as a privation, not just of independence,\nbut of citizenship, that is of personhood under its political aspect.\nWhere Kittay manages to loosen the grip of the agential conception,\nwhen she reminds us that capability is necessarily double-edged, and\nthat a less capable person is also a person less capable of doing\ninhuman harm,51 Nussbaum seems unwilling to allow that capability\nis not synonymous with personhood and per se desirable. In relation\nto Kittay\u2019s profoundly disabled daughter, Nussbaum insists, \u2018a full\nhuman life [must] involve a kind of freedom and individuality\u2019.52\nBut although Kittay\u2019s arguments for acknowledging dependency\ngo a certain way towards correcting the agential conception, I think\nthey do not go deep enough. This is because Kittay conceives of\ndependency as a state that persons can be in or out of, and of\npersons as more or less dependent. On the view of independence\n49 Kittay, 1999, op. cit. 107.\n50 Nussbaum, op. cit. 64.\n51 Kittay, 2005, op. cit. 123.\n52 Nussbaum, op. cit. 65.\n602\nSoran Reader\nand dependency that I have urged, this cannot be right. The \u2018inde-\npendent\u2019 person is dependent even in their independence. So the\nproblem with the agential conception of the person in its political\nmode, is not ( just) that it leaves those called \u2018dependents\u2019 and\nthose who care for them out of the reckoning, it is that it does\nnot acknowledge the necessary dependencies that constantly and\ninalienably structure the lives of even the most \u2018independent\u2019\nactive, capable, free, choosing, rational human beings.53\nSometimes Nussbaum seems to notice just how inalienable and\npervasive dependency is. For example, she comments critically on\nthe damaging effects of a split between rational personhood and ani-\nmality which she associates with Kant, and urges us to prefer a con-\nception of the person she associates morewith Aristotle, which makes\nanimality fundamental, with rationality and sociability specifying the\nkind of animal we are.54 But Nussbaum does not draw the conclusion\nI suggest we should draw here: we are not just rational and social\nanimals that are sometimes dependent and sometimes depended\non\u2014as persons we are also and as much patients, incapable, needy,\ndependent and subject to constraints, necessities and the limits of\nrationality. Like supporters of the strong \u2018career self\u2019 versions of\nthe agential conception, Nussbaum sees practical reason as pervading\nand structuring human personhood. Against this background,\ndependency cannot but look like a privation, like something the\ncapable or lucky person will avoid.\n5. Conclusion\nIf these sketched arguments are roughly right, there is as much of the\nself, the person, in the passive aspects of personal being as in the\nactive ones. We do not need to see passivity as a failure attain full per-\nsonhood, or as a falling away from it. Full persons\u2014all of us\u2014are\npassive, needy, constrained and dependent as well as active,\n53 Thanks to Eva Kittay for thought-provoking discussion about this.\nAlthough Kittay and I agree dependency and care are neglected and import-\nant, we disagree about whether promotion of agency is a good remedy. In her\nunpublished response to this paper, Kittay argues it is only through attribu-\ntion and recognition of their agency, that patients can gain equality as citi-\nzens, and that dominant agents can come to recognise their own passivity\nand vulnerability. This argument is important, and I hope to respond to\nit in future work.\n54 Op. cit. 53\u20134; 62\u20133.\n603\nThe Other Side of Agency\ncapable, free and independent. This changes the philosophical task of\ngiving an account of the person, from tracing what persons do or can\ndo or become, the respects in which they are free, the choices they have,\nthe reasons they use, or the ways in which they are independent. The\nmore complex philosophical task that now faces us, is that of explor-\ning what persons suffer as well as what they do, what they cannot do\nor become as much as what they can, the respects in which they are\nconstrained, the necessities they are subject to, the contingencies\nthat structure their responses to the world, and the ways they are con-\nnected to and dependent on other things.\nTomake good progress with this, we need to pay attention to things\nthat do not demand our attention. We should begin by seeking out\nand witnessing to the truths of the passive, weak, needy, helpless,\nconfused, entangled and overwhelmed. We have to resist the tempta-\ntion to tidy personhood up, to present it like a student on graduation\nday, all neatly turned out to receive a prize for its achievement. It is\nfine to pay attention to the agential aspects of personhood. Agency,\nwith the action, capability, freedom and independence it presumes,\nis a fine thing, in its place. But it is not fine to give agency all the atten-\ntion, and to pretend that the non-agential aspects of our life are some\nhow less human, less valuable, less our own.We need to overcome our\nfear of passivity (which is probably a mixed fear of death and of\nwomen), and present the prize of philosophical recognition and pol-\nitical attention to each other as abject victims too.55\nDurham University\n55 Thanks to Catriona Mackenzie, Susan Brison, John O\u2019Neill and\nChristopher Rowe for the early conversations which led me to this topic.\nThanks to the organisers of the American Philosophical Association\nEasternDivision conference inWashingtonDC inDecember 2006 for invit-\ning me to present an earlier version of this paper in a symposium called \u2018The\nOther Side of Agency\u2019.
