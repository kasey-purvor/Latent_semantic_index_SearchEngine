As is well known, the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries witnessed\nconsiderable anxiety about the power of the printed word, as manifested by\ncompeting attempts to control it, and, arguably, by the relatively high numbers of\nbooksellers and printers murdered during the St. Bartholomew\u2019s Day massacres of\n1572; the printing press had enabled reading material to be made available on a\nscale vastly beyond any previously known, and, in the context of religious division\nand civil war, this possibility had been exploited in the service of polemic.1 Even\nwhere Protestant-authored texts make no religiously divisive arguments, concerns\nabout their influence may be detected on the part of Catholic readers. This essay\nwill explore anxieties about reading and imitating the confessional \u2018other\u2019, that is,\nanxieties that beneath an apparently unproblematic textual surface there might\nlurk dangers which cannot be fully countered by censorship or by care taken while\nreading. \nTherefore, whereas Richard Scholar\u2019s contribution to this volume examines the\ncognitive benefits perceived in imitating writers considered as \u2018friends\u2019, I will\nanalyse concerns about imitating those who could not straightforwardly be\nportrayed as \u2018friends\u2019, and who might even be described as \u2018adversaries\u2019.\nImitation, I will argue, emerges as a problem of relating to the \u2018other\u2019, not in the\nform with which we are most familiar \u2013 that of a Greco-Roman other who is\ndistant and desired, if also threatening \u2013 but rather that of a Protestant other whom\na Catholic imitator might wish to maintain at a distance and to avoid\nNottingham French Studies, Vol. 49 No. 3, Autumn 2010\n* I am grateful to the British Academy for financial support which enabled me to undertake\nthe research for this essay. I would also like to thank Richard Scholar for his very helpful\ncomments on a draft, and Terence Cave and John O\u2019Brien for observations about plagiarism\nand censorship, made in response to an oral version of this work.\n1.

There are a\nnumber of reasons why these poems are a particularly promising testing ground\nfor the investigation. Firstly, Du Bartas was, of course, exceptionally popular; his\nworks were rapidly produced in hundreds of editions published throughout\nFrance,2 as well as being translated into languages including English, Dutch,\nLatin, German, Italian, Polish, Danish and Swedish.3 Secondly, Du Bartas\u2019s work\nwas central to the promotion and renewal of Christian poetry, and was read and\nimitated by Catholics as well as Protestants; Catholics deeply concerned with the\nreligious role of poetry adopted a model of it which had been most clearly\nfurthered by a Protestant.4 Thirdly, Du Bartas\u2019s work was very predominantly\nirenic; while it does contain some politically controversial material,5 it tends to\navoid points of theological contention. The poem received the authorisation of the\nSorbonne, and no Catholic reader was able, to my knowledge, to identify more\nthan a very small number of problematic passages (and just as many or more were\n2. There were at least two hundred editions of Du Bartas\u2019s works between 1574 and 1632.

One discussion in particular seems to have seized the attention of a\nnumber of Du Bartas\u2019s imitators, most obviously the Catholics Michel Quillian\nand Jude Serclier, in, respectively, the Derniere Semaine, ou Consommation du\nmonde (1596)7 and the Grand Tombeau du monde, ou Jugement final (1606),8 and\nthe Protestants Christofle de Gamon and Abel d\u2019Argent, in the Semaine, ou\ncreation du monde, du Sieur Christofle de Gamon, contre celle du Sieur du Bartas\n6. Fran\u00e7ois Feu-ardent located lines in Du Bartas\u2019s poetry which he considered misleading\nwith reference to the Trinity, Hell, and whether Adam and Enoch could enjoy beatific vision\nimmediately after their deaths: Sepmaine premiere des dialogues, ausquels sont examinez et\nconfutez cent soixante et quatorze erreurs des Calvinistes, partie contre la tres-saincte\nTrinit\u00e9 et unit\u00e9 de Dieu en commun, partie contre chacune des trois personnes en particulier\n(Paris: Sebastien et Robert Nivelle, 1589), ff. 27v-29r; Theomachia calvinistica, sedecim\nlibris profligata, quibus mille et quadringenti huius sect\u00e6 novissim\u00e6 errores [\u2026] (Paris:\napud Sebastianum Nivellium, 1604), vol.

On the other hand,\nthe Protestant Simon Goulart felt it necessary in his commentary to direct the interpretation\nof some of Du Bartas\u2019s lines, including those about the Trinity, and Christofle de Gamon, in\nhis Semaine, ou creation du monde [\u2026] contre celle du Sieur du Bartas (1609), found a\nlarge number of errors in Du Bartas\u2019s poem (although many pertain to natural philosophy\nmore than theology).\n7.

What is striking, though, is that three of the four poets imply that Du\nBartas\u2019s own poetry might harm readers: whereas Du Bartas and d\u2019Argent criticise\nonly love poetry, which they contrast with their own poetry dedicated to God,\nGamon, Quillian and Serclier all convey concern about the influence of Du\nBartas\u2019s popular poem. The unease is not restricted to Catholic poets: the poem of\nthe Protestant Gamon is written \u2018against\u2019 that of Du Bartas and proceeds for the\nmost part by careful correction of Du Bartas\u2019s \u2018errors\u2019 (which often consist, for\nGamon, in his not following the Bible closely enough); and, in Gamon\u2019s imitation\nof Du Bartas\u2019s discussion of poetry, the poet suggests that \u2018architectes d\u2019erreurs\u2019\n\u2013 such as \u2018le Chantre Gascon\u2019, Du Bartas \u2013 \u2018poison\u2019 their readers whereas he,\nGamon, provides them with \u2018good food\u2019 (pp. 67-69). However, the case of the\nCatholic poets Serclier and Quillian is particularly interesting, since, as we shall\nsee, anxieties about reading and about the effects of Du Bartas\u2019s influential poem\nbecome bound up with confessional difference, and the potential \u2018poison\u2019 of\npoetry with Protestantism, with its depiction as disease or corruption, and even\nwith its perceived attack upon the body of Christ. Moreover, whereas Gamon\u2019s\nParques \u00c9tranges\u201d: Modalit\u00e9s et enjeux de la repr\u00e9sentation de l\u2019Apocalypse dans la\nDerni\u00e8re Semaine ou consommation du monde de Michel Quillian\u2019, Eidolon, 57 (2000),\n105-15; Fran\u00e7ois Roudaut, \u2018D\u2019un d\u00e9sordre \u00e0 l\u2019autre: Michel Quillian continuateur de\nGuillaume du Bartas\u2019, in Du Bartas: actes des premi\u00e8res journ\u00e9es du Centre Jacques de\nLaprade tenues au Mus\u00e9e national du ch\u00e2teau de Pau le 19 novembre 1993, edited by James\nDauphin\u00e9 et Paul Mironneau ([Pau]: J. & D. \u00c9ditions, 1994) pp. 89\u2013102.\n9.

Quillian, a Breton minor\nnoble, appears to have been close to the League. 1588 saw the publication of a\npoetic Discours dedicated to Henri de Guise and signed by \u2018[v]ostre perpetual et\ntres-obeissant serviteur, M. Q. Breton\u2019.11 The poem, explicitly intended as an\n\u2018heroique chant\u2019,12 celebrates the duke\u2019s victories over the Protestants, as well as\nvilifying the latter and appealing to the former to \u2018kill the Huguenot monster\u2019 \n(p. 8); it was republished in 1589, after the murder of the duke, under the titles\nPan\u00e9gyric, ou Discours sur les faictz h\u00e9royques de feu Mgr le duc de Guise,13 and\nGrandeurs et vaillantises de monsieur de Guyse, prince de Jouinville.14 Seven\nyears later, after the conversion and crowning of Henri IV, Quillian dedicated his\nDerniere Semaine to the new king (albeit in a somewhat ambivalent manner), and\nsought to obtain a position with Henri, offering legal or poetic services,15 as well\nas demonstrating through his poem the willingness to write in the style of Du\nBartas who, as was well known, had served Henri closely;16 the opening of the\n11.

Du Bartas became Navarre\u2019s \u00e9cuyer tranchant in 1576 and fought in his service, as well as\nparticipating in the Academy at the Court of Navarre and serving as a kind of court poet there.\nHe became Henri\u2019s gentilhomme-servant in 1580 and his gentleman in ordinary of the bed\nchamber in 1585, and was sent by him on a diplomatic mission to Scotland and England in\n1587. The poet\u2019s connection with Henri was well known enough that a figure named \u2018Bartus\u2019\nappears by Henri\u2019s side in Christopher Marlowe\u2019s play The Massacre at Paris (despite the fact\nthat we know of no claims that Du Bartas actually was in Paris during the massacres); see The\nWorks of Guillaume De Salluste Sieur Du Bartas, edited by Urban Tigner Holmes Jr, John\nCoriden Lyons, Robert White Linker and others, 3 vols (Chapel Hill: The University of North\nCarolina Press, 1935-40), I, 11-20, and also Yvonne Bellenger and Jean-Claude Ternaux, Du\nBartas (Paris: Memini, 1998), pp. 134\u201335, and James Dauphin\u00e9, \u2018Du Bartas et Henri de\nNavarre\u2019, in Du Bartas 1590\u20131990: actes du colloque international d\u2019Auch, pp. 131\u201341. \n07 Banks  24\/11\/2010  16:47  Page 66\n67CONFESSIONAL IDENTITY, EATING AND READING\npoem, too, includes a section making it clear that Quillian is not on the side of\nthose who resist the king or of their Spanish supporters (p. 2). However, in places\nthe Derniere Semaine demonstrates an instransigent and aggressive attitude\ntowards Protestants. For example, just as God sometimes punishes men straight\naway, so the French kill Huguenots (p. 149). Likewise, in the passage about poetry\nand reading, Quillian displays hostility, suggesting, despite his own debts to Du\nBartas, that texts by Protestants should never be read. Serclier, on the other hand,\nwas an Augustinian canon regular of the minor order of St Ruff in Avignon; he\ncombined interests in eschatology and demonology, publishing a treatise,\nl\u2019Antidemon historial (1609), as well as a number of works on religious topics. By\ncontrast with Quillian, Serclier expresses admiration for Du Bartas\u2019s work.\nHowever, as we shall see, arguably he nonetheless shares with Quillian a sense of\nProtestantism as a \u2018poison\u2019 which might be \u2018consumed\u2019 through reading, giving\nrise to \u2018disease\u2019 or \u2018corruption\u2019. \nFor Serclier and Quillian, as for Du Bartas, poetry is a powerful and potentially\n\u2018poisonous\u2019 force, which can lead the reader away from the divine as well as towards\nit, and can deceive as well as enlighten.17 All three fear poets who are pipeur[s].18\nHowever, Quillian\u2019s discussion recalls that of Du Bartas more immediately than\nSerclier\u2019s does. Quillian, like Du Bartas, situates his treatment of the question at the\noutset of the second \u2018Day\u2019 and, linguistically speaking, echoes Du Bartas very\nclosely. His opening line \u2013 \u2018que je hay ces esprits, dont la voix flateresse\u2019 \u2013 recalls\nthat of Du Bartas, \u2018Tous ces doctes esprits, dont la voix charmeresse\u2019.19 Like Du\nBartas, Quillian uses images of \u2018bait\u2019 and hidden \u2018poison\u2019 to portray the potential\npitfalls of poetry. However, whereas Serclier, like Du Bartas, compares different\npossible sources of subject-matter for poetry, and suggests it is better to celebrate\nGod than Cupid or ladies,20 Quillian\u2019s argument differs radically from Du Bartas\u2019s,\nas the following extracts from the two poets demonstrate:\nTous ces doctes esprits, dont la voix flateresse\nChange Hecube en Helene et Faustine en Lucresse,\nQui d\u2019un nain, d\u2019un bastard, d\u2019un archerot sans yeux,\nFont, non un dieutelet, ains le maistre des dieux,\nSur les ingrats seillons d\u2019une infertile arene,\nPerdent, mal-avisez, leur travail et leur graine,\n17. For Serclier, love poetry \u2018poisons\u2019, undermines the honour of the divine, and disguises as if\nwith a \u2018fard\u2019, \u2018masque\u2019 or \u2018voile\u2019 (pp. 229, 244); poets should focus instead on the\n\u2018veritable\u2019 (pp. 236, 238). Elsewhere, too, he suggests that poetry can induce real sin \n(pp. 68-70).

Whereas Du Bartas warns his readers\nagainst love poets, Quillian warns his readers against poets who warn against love\npoets while themselves offering up a far more harmful reading-matter, namely\nreligious poetry of a heterodox nature. Such reading does not simply \u2018poison\u2019, as\n07 Banks  24\/11\/2010  16:47  Page 68\n69CONFESSIONAL IDENTITY, EATING AND READING\nlove poetry does, but rather produces \u2018illness\u2019, an image which seems to bear here\nits commonplace connotation of sin, as well as, perhaps, that of \u2018swelling up\u2019\n(\u2018l\u2019esprit hydropicque\u2019) with false doctrine; the language of poison and resulting\nillness recalls that used by Ronsard to describe Protestant polemic in the early years\nof the Wars of Religion.21 While love poetry may serve as bait, Quillian suggests,\nproblematic religious poetry resembles the line which draws the reader in. Quillian\nalso highlights his view of heterodox religious poets in the opening line of the\n\u2018argument\u2019 which precedes and summarises his second \u2018Day\u2019:\n[A]vant que de commencer, il [Quillian] blasme quelques Po\u00ebtes de nostre aage, qui\nfont estat de reprendre ceux qui ont escrit de l\u2019amour estans euxmesmes\nreprehensibles, en ce que de leur part, ils opinent assez mal de la Religion Catholique\net Romaine, employans parmy leurs \u0153uvres beaucoup de Discours qui sont du tout\nreprouvez  [\u2026] \n(Quillian, La Derniere Semaine, \u2018Argument du Second Jour\u2019, p. 25)\nQuillian does not explicitly refer to Protestants in general or to Du Bartas in\nparticular. He prefers to describe those he maligns as belonging to a \u2018faithless\u2019\ngroup (\u2018infidelle escole\u2019) or as \u2018failing to grasp\u2019 Catholic beliefs (\u2018ils opinent assez\nmal de la Religion Catholique et Romaine\u2019) rather than as belonging to a different\nconfession or as having different beliefs. His choice not to criticise Du Bartas\nexplicitly might be attributed to the popularity of the deceased poet and his well-\nknown relationship with the king, to whom Quillian has addressed his poem and\nexpressed his desire for a position. In the context of late sixteenth-century France,\nthough, an \u2018infidelle escole\u2019 clearly implies Protestantism, and Du Bartas would\nsurely have been the first Protestant poet to spring to any reader\u2019s mind. Moreover,\nas we have seen, Quillian\u2019s discussion closely imitates Du Bartas\u2019s censure of love\npoets within a poem which imitates Du Bartas\u2019s poem; even as Quillian borrows\nan opening line from Du Bartas, he expresses his hatred of those who have made\narguments like that of Du Bartas. Therefore those readers familiar with Du\nBartas\u2019s poetry would have perceived a jibe pointed \u2013 through parodic borrowing\n\u2013 at Du Bartas in particular. For those who did not recognise the borrowing from\nDu Bartas\u2019s Sepmaine (including those who had not read his poetry at all but knew\nit only by repute), there is still a suggestion that Protestant-authored Christian\npoetry \u2013 and a fortiori that of Du Bartas, by far the most well known \u2013 is\ndangerous and to be avoided. Quillian\u2019s Derniere Semaine ou consommation du\nmonde appears, then, not as a sequel to the Protestant-authored Sepmaine ou\ncreation du monde but rather as a substitute for it, designed to undermine the\ninfluence of the popular text.\n21. Katherine Maynard, \u2018\u00ab Miel empoisonn\u00e9 \u00bb: Satire and Sickness in Ronsard\u2019s Discours des\nMis\u00e8res de ce temps\u2019, in La Satire dans tous ses \u00e9tats, edited by Bernd Renner (Geneva:\nDroz, 2009), pp. 245-64 (pp. 248-51).\n07 Banks  24\/11\/2010  16:47  Page 69\n70 KATHRYN BANKS\nFor Quillian, the confessional identity of a poet appears to be central in\ndetermining the worth of his poem, as if the text served as a transparent depiction\nof all the supposed beliefs of its author. One can be sure that reading one\u2019s\n\u2018adversary\u2019 will be worse than not reading religious poetry at all (\u2018il vaut beaucoup\nmieux s\u2019abstenir [\u2026]\u2019), and indeed may contribute to one\u2019s damnation\n(\u2018l\u2019Eternelle mort\u2019). While it was far from unusual to consider Protestant-authored\ntexts as \u2018poison\u2019,22 for Quillian this is necessarily the case even where the content\nof the text does not appear controversial. Confessional difference is perceived in\nantagonistic and oppositional terms: Quillian opens his second \u2018Day\u2019 with an\nemphatic expression of hatred for the religious poets he criticises, then goes on to\ndescribe them as \u2018reprehensibles\u2019 and \u2018adversaire[s]\u2019. In the \u2018argument\u2019 placed at\nthe outset of the book, too, Quillian states that the poets he reproaches write much\nthat is entirely forbidden or condemnable (\u2018beaucoup de Discours qui sont du tout\nreprouvez\u2019), as if a Protestant poet would, by definition, compose large amounts\nof pernicious material. In addition, Quillian\u2019s formulation suggests that he\nimagines this material to be scattered about in Protestant-authored works:\n\u2018employans parmy leurs \u0153uvres\u2019. Quillian has quite obviously read at least one\npassage from the Sepmaine, and so presumably could have read the poem\nattentively, checking it for material which would be \u2018du tout reprouvez\u2019. He could\nnot have found much fitting that description; the Sepmaine had been approved by\ncensors, and even Fran\u00e7ois Feu-ardent in his Sepmaine premiere and Theomachia\ncalvinistica only managed to find fault with a handful of passages.23\nWhile Quillian clearly believed that an apocalyptic depiction of the universe\nwas more useful to readers\u2019 salvation than Du Bartas\u2019s relatively youthful one,24\nthis is nonetheless a far cry from locating lines in the poem which are \u2018du tout\nreprouvez\u2019 and might bring about the reader\u2019s \u2018Eternelle mort\u2019. The Catholic poet\napparently did not believe that the power of Protestant print could be countered by\nsimply rectifying or excising particularly problematic statements, as official\ncensors did for many texts (although not the Sepmaine), or by highlighting and\ncorrecting them as Fran\u00e7ois Feu-ardent did for writers including Du Bartas. Given\nthe shortage of confessionally or dogmatically contentious material in Du Bartas\u2019s\npoem, Quillian\u2019s hostile attitude seems to indicate a general anxiety about the\neffects of reading Du Bartas or other Protestant poets, a sense that, even where no\nthreat has been located, there might be danger concealed beneath the surface of the\ntext, dispersed throughout its different sections in a way which could be difficult\nto spot. \n22. One thinks, for example, of Artus D\u00e9sir\u00e9\u2019s Contrepoison des cinquante-deux chansons de\nCl\u00e9ment Marot. Quillian\u2019s aforementioned Discours describes Protestants and their doctrine\nas poison (p. 8 and passim).\n23. See n. 6.\n24. On this point see further Banks, \u2018Les Mondes nouveau-n\u00e9 et viellissant\u2026\u2019 (article cited\nabove, note 8).\n07 Banks  24\/11\/2010  16:47  Page 70\n71CONFESSIONAL IDENTITY, EATING AND READING\nBy contrast with Quillian\u2019s Derniere Semaine, Serclier\u2019s Grand Tombeau does\nnot express open hostility towards poets with heterodox religious beliefs. Indeed\nSerclier praises Du Bartas. Affirming that Serclier\u2019s own subject, divine justice, is\nbetter than those of other poets, the Catholic poet adds a rhetorical question, asking\nhis muse whom she thinks \u2018gave wings\u2019 to the poet, and replying that it certainly was\nnot Cupid, implying, of course, that the poet is inspired by the Christian God rather\nthan a pagan one, and therefore should sing about that God. \u2018The poet\u2019 who gained\nhis wings from God subsequently seems to represent not \u2018the poet\u2019 in general but\nrather Du Bartas: \u2018the poet\u2019 is said to have sung eloquently of the universe, and to\nhave been crowned with laurels above his contemporaries, a description which most\nobviously calls to mind Du Bartas; moreover the accompanying commentary \u2013\nwritten by Serclier himself and published together with all editions of his poem \u2013\nrefers to the \u2018autheur de la sepmaine\u2019.25 So, although Serclier refrains from\nmentioning him explicitly within the poem itself, \u2018the poet\u2019 whose divine gift\njustifies Serclier\u2019s own choice of subject-matter appears to be Du Bartas; the\nreference to the winged poet follows a list of poets whom Serclier does not want to\nfollow because, while talented, they chose unworthy subjects (p. 236), so the\nimplication is that Serclier considers the winged poet, Du Bartas, more worthy of\nimitation, as indeed Serclier\u2019s poem as a whole would suggest. The commentary\nheaps praise on the Protestant poet, describing him as one of the most excellent\nFrench poets, to whom everybody will give one of the foremost ranks. The first\nSepmaine is a \u2018masterpiece of poetic art\u2019, and in it Du Bartas \u2018sings like an angel\u2019: \nSi leurs discours sont doux, les miens sont veritables\nLes leurs sont empoullez, et les miens profitables\nDonc muse ne les suy, ains d\u2019un subject plus beau\nParfay Chrestiennement ton esbauch\u00e9 Tumbeau,\nAu\u00dfi qui pense [sic] tu avoir donn\u00e9 des ayles\nAu docte truchement des lyricques pucelles,\nPour avoir si facond de ses resonnans vers,\nPar l\u2019oreille tir\u00e9 apres soy l\u2019univers\nQui l\u2019admire beant ores sur Thytor\u00e9e,\nHonneur Phocydien, ou dessus l\u2019hyampee\nSur ses contemporains d\u2019Appollo couronn\u00e9\nDes plus mignars cheveux de sa chiere daphn\u00e9\nCupido ce n\u2019est pas \u202626\n25. The note about Du Bartas in the commentary lacks a corresponding footnote marker in the\ntext but, given that it must correspond to the material before the next footnote marker, and\nthat the poets criticized at the top of the page have subjects different from that of Du Bartas,\nit is clearly supposed to gloss the idea of the winged poet and \/ or that of Christian poetry\n(\u2018un subject plus beau\u2019, p. 237).\n26. Grand Tombeau, p. 236. Although, like Du Bartas and Quillian, Serclier begins one of the\nbooks of his poem with a consideration of poetry, the extract cited is some eight pages into\nthat discussion, a long one in which Serclier, like d\u2019Aubign\u00e9 in the Tragiques, selects\nMelpomene to be his Muse, and discusses the proper role of poetry.\n07 Banks  24\/11\/2010  16:47  Page 71\n72 KATHRYN BANKS\nEntre les plus excellents po\u00ebte [sic] Fran\u00e7ois, chacun meritoirement donnera l\u2019un des\npremiers rangs, au noble, docte et bien disant autheur de la sepmaine, chef d\u2019\u0153uvre\nde l\u2019art po\u00ebtic, et premier de la posterit\u00e9 [\u2026] il est a estimer en ce que comme Ange\nil a chant\u00e9 en sa premiere sepmaine. (p. 237)\nHowever, Serclier stops short of proclaiming Du Bartas\u2019s value as a model and\nfurthermore he proceeds, after all the praise of Du Bartas, to suggest \u2013\neuphemistically, through citation and metaphor \u2013 that there are problems inherent\nin imitating him. Somewhat parenthetically, and in Latin, Serclier cites, without\ngiving the source, 1 Corinthians 5:7, \u2018Modicum fermentum corrumpit totam\nmassam\u2019 (\u2018a little leaven corrupts the whole lump\u2019). In the Biblical passage from\nwhich Serclier\u2019s quotation is taken, Paul admonishes the Corinthians for not\n\u2018purging out\u2019 the \u2018leaven\u2019 which will \u2018corrupt\u2019 the whole, that is, for accepting the\npresence within their Church of sinners and thus risking the corruption of the\nwhole body of the Church. In addition, in the same chapter of Corinthians, leaven\nis opposed to the \u2018unleavened bread\u2019 of \u2018truth\u2019, and, for example, in Matthew\n16:11-12, it represents the false doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees. The\ncitation, which bears the weight of Biblical authority, points to the dangers of\ncontamination or corruption by heretical doctrine, untruth, and sin. For Serclier,\nthen, as for Quillian, Du Bartas\u2019s poetry appears to contain a threat not unlike that\nperceived in love poetry, namely that of a falsehood opposed to divine truth.\nFurthermore, this \u2018leaven\u2019 of falsity or sin corrupts \u2018the whole\u2019, implying \u2013 not\nunlike Quillian\u2019s reference to material dispersed \u2018parmy leurs \u0153uvres\u2019 \u2013 that\ndangers \u2018seep through\u2019 the entirety of Du Bartas\u2019s poem.\nSerclier does not mention Protestantism or confessional difference as such, yet,\nas in Quillian\u2019s discussion, this seems to be what is at stake. \u2018Leaven\u2019 points to\n\u2018false\u2019 doctrine and, in addition, Protestants were the source of leaven in a more\nliteral sense: at Geneva leavened bread was used for the Eucharist, and Calvin and\nB\u00e8ze maintained that any kind of bread was suitable, whereas the 1570 papal bull,\nDe Defectibus, stated that, if the bread had begun to corrupt, or contained leaven,\nthe celebrant would be guilty of grave sin. Protestants also foregrounded and made\nuse of the corruption of bread in a conceptual sense, since, like bread being\nvomited or defecated, it could serve to mock the Catholic belief that the bread\nreally was the body of Christ. \nMore importantly, though, the \u2018corruption of the whole\u2019 recalls the perception,\npromoted by some Catholic preachers during the Wars of Religion, of\nProtestantism as a \u2018pollution\u2019 within the collective ecclesiastical and social\n\u2018body\u2019.27 After all, in its original context in Corinthians, the \u2018whole\u2019 which is\n27. Cf. Barbara Diefendorf, Beneath the Cross: Catholics and Huguenots in Sixteenth-Century\nParis (Oxford:  Oxford University Press, 1991), pp. 28-48, 145-58, and Natalie Zemon\nDavis, \u2018Rites of Violence\u2019, in Society and Culture in Early Modern France: eight essays\n(California: Stanford University Press, 1975), pp. 152-87.\n07 Banks  24\/11\/2010  16:47  Page 72\n73CONFESSIONAL IDENTITY, EATING AND READING\ncorrupted in Serclier\u2019s citation is indeed the body of the Church; thanks to the\nfundamental links in Christian thought between bread, the body of Christ, and the\nbody of the Church, leaven could logically be thought of as corrupting the\ncollective body. Moreover, during the Wars of Religion, the conceptualisation of\nthe ecclesiastical and social collectivity as \u2018one bread and one body\u2019 was a\npowerful one: Parisian preachers highlighted it in their sermons and vernacular\ntreatises, emphasizing that this body was threatened by the \u2018disease\u2019 or\n\u2018corruption\u2019 within it, namely Protestantism (and its \u2018disease-bearing\u2019 books,\n\u2018livres pestilentiels\u2019).28 In addition, the hypothesis that Serclier\u2019s citation betrays a\nconcern with the pollution of \u2018heresy\u2019 sits well with the apocalyptic interests\nwhich are the central focus of his poem: the defilement of the collective body by\nProtestantism was often attributed an apocalyptic significance.29\nFurthermore, the notion of Protestantism as a disease within the collective\nbody or \u2018bread\u2019 gained energy from the fierce debates around Eucharistic doctrine,\n\u2018the focus of more theological controversy [...] than any other item of Christian\nconfession and practice\u2019,30 and central to the definition of confessional identity.\nThe conceptualisation of society as one body (or bread) was tightly bound up with\nCatholic Eucharistic devotion, and Catholic writers had a tendency to link the\nProtestant threat to the social body with the Protestant challenge to Catholic\nEucharistic doctrine. Since the social body and the body of Christ were \u2018so closely\nintertwined as to be inseparable\u2019,31 the \u2018disease\u2019 of Protestantism seemed to affect\nthe body of Christ as well as the social body, and this perception was reinforced\nby the Protestant challenge to the body of Christ as understood by Catholics, that\nis, as present in the bread displayed by the priest.32\nThus, used with reference to a Protestant poet in the immediate aftermath of the\nWars of Religion, Serclier\u2019s brief citation from Corinthians was rich in meaning,\nrecalling a nexus of ideas around the contamination of Catholic \u2018bodies\u2019 by\nProtestants and by Protestant thinking or writing. In the context of Serclier\u2019s poem,\nthe citation arguably betrays a fear that the \u2018leaven\u2019 or pollution of Protestantism\nmight be insidiously working its evil within Du Bartas\u2019s apparently holy poem and\nmight threaten the community of Catholic readers. The development of the passage\nafter the citation demonstrates that Serclier is concerned precisely about the\npossibility of absorbing leaven through his reading. Serclier insists that he\nconsumes Du Bartas\u2019s work carefully and selectively. In two parts of a threefold\n28.

The poet \u2018sucks the flower and leaves the\nstem\u2019, and \u2018takes the rose but rejects the thorns\u2019:\n[\u2026] chacun meritoirement donnera l\u2019un des premiers rangs, au noble, docte et bien\ndisant autheur de la sepmaine, chef d\u2019\u0153uvre de l\u2019art po\u00ebtic, et premier de la posterit\u00e9,\nmais pource que Modicum fermentum corrumpit totam massam, je succe avec les\nAvettes, la fleur et laisse la tige, je prens la rose de son riche et sacr\u00e9 argument, et\nrejette les espines, qui si [sic] pouvoient mesler. (p. 237, italics in the original)\nThe semantic field of food and eating is still present, as it was in the reference to\nleaven, but the shift of image to bees and flowers enables Serclier to suggest that\n\u2018eating\u2019 (or reading and imitation) can be selective: while we cannot avoid the\nleaven in leavened bread, bees can and do take from flowers but not from their\npoisonous stems or their thorns. This depiction of a careful imitative practice\nseems designed to hold at bay the threat of \u2018poisonous\u2019 reading, and also, by the\nsame token, a sign of anxiety about that threat. Reading, according to sixteenth-\ncentury conceptions of imitation, is like taking the other into one\u2019s own body; this\nseems particularly problematic when the other belongs to the confession\ncommonly conceived to poison or to pollute the collective body. \nThus, in Serclier\u2019s Grand Tombeau, issues of reading and those of the\nProtestant \u2018threat\u2019 intersect through images of eating and food. Eating and\nconfessional identity thus become linked in a very different way from that in\nProtestant polemic about Catholic \u2018cannibalism\u2019 or \u2018theophagy\u2019.34 The analogy\nbetween reading and eating \u2013 or reading-matter and food, or imitation and\ndigestion \u2013 was commonplace,35 and one version of it, employed in the passages\n33. On the diverse uses of the apian metaphor, see G. W. Pigman III, \u2018Versions of Imitation in\nthe Renaissance\u2019, Renaissance Quarterly, 33 (1980), 1-32 (pp. 3-7); Ann Moss, Printed\nCommonplace-Books and the Structuring of Renaissance Thought (Oxford: Clarendon\nPress, 1996), passim; Thomas M.

However, Serclier combines this analogy with\nanother fairly commonplace image derived from the domain of food, that of a\nfigurative foodstuff, leaven, understood to represent false doctrine or sin. In\naddition, Serclier implicitly creates a connection between the endeavour of literary\ncreation \u2013 understood more than it is today as a collective endeavour, which draws\non the texts of others in the construction of one\u2019s own \u2013 and that of salvation,\nunderstood as \u2018at least in part a collective enterprise\u2019, achieved within and through\nthe \u2018one bread, and one body\u2019 of society.36 I would suggest, tentatively, that this\nmight bolster Michel Jeanneret\u2019s hypothesis according to which\nconceptualisations of reading had borrowed something from the notion of\nEucharistic \u2018communion\u2019:37 the context in which Serclier employs his citation\nfrom Corinthians seems to make a link between reading or imitation and that\ncollective body or bread modelled on communion in the body of Christ. Certainly\nmy analysis suggests that the conception of literary creation as involving a\n\u2018communal\u2019 element \u2013 that is, incorporating the creations of others \u2013 caused\nunease in an age of religious schism: for Serclier, at least, the \u2018poison\u2019 or \u2018leaven\u2019\nof Protestantism seems to endanger the collective enterprise of textual creation by\nthe same token that it threatens the collective health of society. \nSo, Serclier\u2019s discussion of Du Bartas implies that the latter\u2019s poem contains a\nProtestant \u2018leaven\u2019 which contaminates the whole text and could harm those who\n\u2018consume\u2019 it: Du Bartas\u2019s Protestantism seems to define the nature and threat of\nhis poetry. However, Serclier, unlike Quillian, also resists this idea, drawing a\nclear distinction between man and poet. While Du Bartas the man might have\nerred, Du Bartas the poet sang like an angel, that is, like a being closer to the\ndivine than any man, Catholic or Protestant, could hope to be: \u2018s\u2019il est a mespriser\nen ce que comme homme il a failli, il est a estimer en ce que comme Ange il a\nchant\u00e9 en sa premiere sepmaine\u2019. Thus Serclier underplays any sense that the\npoet\u2019s confessional identity necessarily determines the value of his poem.\nMoreover, while the image of leaven suggests a corruption which would seep\nthrough the whole of the poem, Serclier concludes his discussion of Du Bartas by\nstating that only \u2018deux ou trois mots\u2019 of Du Bartas\u2019s poem detract from its status\nas the \u2018work of an angel\u2019. Serclier tells the reader where these troublesome words\ncan be found, and what topics they concern: one passage concerns the Trinity and\nis situated in \u2018Day\u2019 I; the other criticizes celibacy and is found in \u2018Day\u2019 VI.38 By\n36. Diefendorf, p. 34.\n37. \u2018Entre les deux parties, une communion s\u2019\u00e9tablit, \u00e0 laquelle l\u2019id\u00e9al de l\u2019eucharistie, qui hante\nalors les consciences, n\u2019est peut-\u00eatre pas \u00e9tranger\u2019 (Perpetuum mobile: m\u00e9tamorphoses des\ncorps et des \u0153uvres de Vinci \u00e0 Montaigne (Paris: Macula, 1997), p. 276).\n38.  \u2018il est a estimer en ce que comme Ange il a chant\u00e9 en sa premiere sepmaine, deux ou trois\nmots au premier et sixiesme jour ostez, l\u2019un pour la saincte Trinit\u00e9, l\u2019autre contre le C\u0153libat\u2019\n(p. 237).\n07 Banks  24\/11\/2010  16:47  Page 75\n76 KATHRYN BANKS\nimplication, then, the problems in Du Bartas\u2019s poem can be identified and located;\nreaders can be warned of them and can take due care when encountering them.\nThis holds at bay any sense that Du Bartas\u2019s Protestantism resembles leaven which\nwould insidiously sweep through and infect the whole; instead, if leaven there is,\nit can, in the words of one patristic gloss on Corinthians, be \u2018purged [...] with\naccuracy\u201939.  In addition, as we have seen, the shift in image from leavened bread\nto flowers assists Serclier in suggesting that readers can \u2018consume\u2019 Du Bartas\u2019s\npoetry without \u2013 to use Serclier\u2019s metaphor \u2013 the \u2018stem\u2019 or \u2018thorns\u2019 of his beliefs. \nFurthermore, whereas Quillian says pretty unequivocally that poetry by\nProtestants (or at least by one\u2019s \u2018adversaires\u2019) is poisonous, Serclier does not\ndefinitively assert that Du Bartas\u2019s poem contains leaven, although he makes it\nclear that, at the very least, he reads as if it might do.40 In addition, arguably the\neuphemistic nature of the discussion at this point \u2013 based in metaphor and\nunreferenced citation \u2013 signals tension.41 Serclier cites the verse from Corinthians\nin Latin, without any gloss, and without naming its source (so that the reader is not\ninvited to read the quotation in its original context and thus to align Du Bartas or\nhis poem with the sinner or sin which must be purged from among the\nCorinthians). While admittedly Serclier often provides short citations in Latin and\nwithout a source, the euphemistic and parenthetical nature of this quotation does\nseem telling. Serclier does not state openly the connotations of leaven but instead\nrefers to it somewhat parenthetically and without further explanation as the reason\nwhy, despite Du Bartas\u2019s excellence, Serclier reads him carefully: \u2018mais pource\nque Modicum fermentum corrumpit totam massam, je succe avec les Avettes, la\nfleur et laisse la tige, je prens la rose\u2019 and so on. \nOne could argue that Serclier provides no gloss simply because he could expect\nmost of his readers to understand the quotation and its implications. On the other\nhand, in general Serclier does seem to conceive of his poem \u2013 or rather of its\ncommentary \u2013 as performing a vulgarising function, a conception which\ncorresponds well to what appears to have been a common view of Du Bartas\u2019s\n39. The homilies of S. John Chrysostom, Archbishop of Constantinople, on the first Epistle of\nSt. Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians (Oxford: J. H. Parker \/ London: F. and J. Rivington,\n1845), p. 199. \n40. Serclier was not the only reader who expressed concern about Du Bartas\u2019s Protestantism yet\nfound the Sepmaine relatively unproblematic: the Jesuit recteur de coll\u00e8ge, P. Mongailhard\nconsidered that there was \u2018very little poison\u2019 in Du Bartas\u2019s works yet nonetheless thought\nit necessary to remind readers of Du Bartas\u2019s Calvinism (Couture, \u2018Les Po\u00e8mes de Du\nBartas\u2019, pp. 490-91). The problem for Serclier is more acute insofar as his poem imitates\nand engages in dialogue with the Sepmaine, potentially increasing the threat of \u2018consuming\u2019\nany \u2018poison\u2019 it might contain.\n41. While Greene (The Light in Troy) suggests that in general the use of metaphors in\ndiscussions of imitation signals tension, by 1606, of course, images such as the bee, or\neating are commonplaces with familiar meanings; however, here they are recast and used\ntogether with the image of leaven. \n07 Banks  24\/11\/2010  16:47  Page 76\n77CONFESSIONAL IDENTITY, EATING AND READING\npoem accompanied (as it was for most readers) by Simon Goulart\u2019s commentary;42\naccordingly, Serclier, like Goulart, often includes knowledge of a non-specialist\nnature. Indeed, later in the same book of his poem, Serclier appears to consider\nthat the term \u2018leaven\u2019 might helpfully be glossed: Mary, interceding with God on\nbehalf of mankind, reminds him that he was conceived \u2018sans le levain du vice\u2019,\nand the commentary explains that \u2018le levain est ordinairement prins en l\u2019escripture\npour le pech\u00e9\u2019. Serclier then discusses this at some length, beginning, as it\nhappens, by making the link with bread and eating, explaining that the Paschal\nlamb should be eaten \u2018sans souilleure, et pech\u00e9 qui est le pain sans levain\u2019 \n(pp. 316-17). Arguably, then, when Serclier does not gloss his earlier reference to\nleaven, this suggests an unwillingness to draw out the implications of his\nsuggestion that \u2018leaven\u2019 might be present in Du Bartas\u2019s poem. A similar\nreluctance can be discerned when Serclier refers to \u2018thorns\u2019 amid poetic \u2018flowers\u2019\nsince Serclier, while protesting that he rejects them, avoids asserting that they\nexist, referring to \u2018les espines, qui si pouvoient mesler\u2019. Likewise, the supposed\nfailings of Du Bartas are presented not as fact but in terms which leave some room\nfor doubt: \u2018s\u2019il est a mespriser en ce que comme homme il a failli\u2019. Finally, of\ncourse, while Serclier suggests that reading a Protestant author is fraught with\ndanger, he nonetheless differs from Quillian in that he admits to reading Du Bartas\nand refrains from suggesting that Protestant-authored material should necessarily\nalways be avoided. \n* \nWhile to observers in the twenty-first century the negative face of imitation most\neasily recognisable is that of plagiarism, for sixteenth- and seventeenth-century\nreaders and writers the possibility of \u2018poisoning\u2019 might seem far more menacing.\nAnd, while some modern textual interpretation has tended to emphasise the \u2018death\nof the author\u2019, in some early-modern reception authorial identity is central in\ndetermining the meaning of texts, as Michel Jeanneret argues in his own\ncontribution to this volume. The two poems analysed in my essay indicate\nconcerns, on the part of both a former Leaguer and a more moderate Catholic, that\nhidden dangers in Protestant-authored texts may be inadequately countered by\nCounter-reformation mechanisms of censorship and correction; confessional\nidentity may appear central in determining the value of a work, so that Protestant-\nauthored ones contain a \u2018poison\u2019 or \u2018corruption\u2019 which is conceived in ways bound\nup with commonplace conceptions of the Protestant \u2018threat\u2019. In an age of mass\ncirculation of texts and religious schism, conceptions of reading and imitating as\n\u2018eating\u2019 and \u2018digesting\u2019 produced anxiety about \u2018consuming\u2019 the confessional\n\u2018other\u2019, even where very few signs of Protestant beliefs were present.\n42.

Certainly the particular shape taken by Catholic anxieties analysed\nhere is inflected by ideas about Protestants, for example as a poison concealed\nwithin the common body. More generally, Catholic anxieties might be fuelled by\nthe particularly effective and early use by Protestants of printing for propagandistic\npurposes. Furthermore, Protestants certainly did make use of Catholic-authored\nreligious material, excising and adding sections of text as appropriate; possibly this\nsuggests a relative lack of concern about hidden \u2018leaven\u2019, although one would need\nto pay close attention to how this practice was represented before drawing any\nconclusions. The anxieties of Serclier and Quillian, on the other hand, are fuelled\nby conceptualisations of Protestant \u2018contamination\u2019, and also by the familiar\nnotion that poetry has powerful effects which should be harnessed to bring the\nreader closer to the divine. They indicate the problematic nature of imitation in a\nworld of confessional schism, of collective literary creation in the face of the\nProtestant \u2018threat\u2019 to the collective body or \u2018bread\u2019.\n07 Banks  24\/11\/2010  16:47  Page 78\n"}
