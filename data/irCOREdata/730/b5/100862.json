Following dopant\nimplantation, good agreement is found between the magnitudes of strain measured by the two\ntechniques. However, following dopant activation by annealing, strain relaxation is detected by\nHRXRD but not by micro-Raman. This discrepancy mainly arises from an anomalous redshift in the\nSi Raman peak position originating from the high levels of doping achieved in the samples. This has\nserious implications for the use of micro-Raman spectroscopy for strain characterization of highly\ndoped strained Si complementary metal-oxide semiconductor devices and structures therein. We find\na direct correlation between the Si Raman shift and peak carrier concentration measured by the\ndifferential Hall technique, which indicates that UV micro-Raman may become a useful tool for\nnondestructive dopant characterization for ultrashallow junctions in these Si-based materials.\n\u00a9 2008 American Institute of Physics. \u0003DOI: 10.1063\/1.2942392\u0004\nThe enhancement of carrier mobilities through the intro-\nduction of strain in the channel region of metal-oxide semi-\nconductor field effect transistors is an important option in\norder to maintain historical complementary metal-oxide\nsemiconductor \u0001CMOS\u0002 performance trends.1 The produc-\ntion of ultrashallow junctions for the source\/drain extension\nregion using low energy ion implantation will be required for\nfuture CMOS devices. Biaxial tensile strain reduces the sheet\nresistance \u0001RS\u0002 of highly doped n type layers created by As\nor Sb implantation. The effect can be stronger for Sb, when\nRs lowering results not only from strain enhanced mobility,\nbut also from an improvement in Sb metastable solubility in\nthe presence of strain.2 This makes Sb an interesting alterna-\ntive to As for ultrashallow junctions in strain-engineered\nCMOS devices. Since an early study by Anastassakis et al.,3\nRaman scattering has been widely used as a strain character-\nization technique in the semiconductor industry4\u20136 and is of-\nten utilized for strain metrology in strained Si films.7,8 Our\nresults show that there are practical difficulties associated\nwith the use of micro-Raman as a strain characterization\ntechnique for highly doped ultrashallow junction Si CMOS\ndevice structures.\nExperiments were performed on two types of tensile-\nstrained Si wafers each grown on Si1\u2212xGex relaxed buffer\nlayers with x=0.2 and x=0.17, and strained Si thicknesses of\n43 and 17.5 nm, respectively. Each wafer was implanted\nwith a 2 keV Sb ion dose of between 1\u00011014 and\n1\u00011015 cm\u22122 creating a junction at a depth of around 10 nm.\nNominally unstrained control samples were prepared using\nconventional p-type Si wafers for comparison. The im-\nplanted dose was confirmed by medium-energy ion scatter-\ning \u0001MEIS\u0002. Dopant activation was achieved by rapid ther-\nmal annealing \u0001RTA\u0002 wafer pieces for 10 s in N2 in the range\nof 600\u2013800 \u00b0C. Room temperature micro-Raman measure-\nments were performed with a Jobin Yvon LabRam HR800\nsystem in backscattering geometry using a 325 nm He-Cd\nUV laser excitation with a spot size of approximately 1 \u0002m.\nHigh-resolution x-ray diffraction \u0001HRXRD\u0002 measurements\nwere performed on a Philips X\u2019Pert Pro diffractometer. Re-\nciprocal space maps were collected with a three-bounce ger-\nmanium analyzer crystal placed before the detector, which\nnarrows the acceptance angle to approximately 12 arc sec.\nPeak carrier concentrations were measured by the differential\nHall profiling technique.9\nDue to the limited UV laser penetration into the samples\n\u00019 nm\u0002, the Raman spectra of both the reference unstrained\nSi bulk and the strained Si samples are dominated by the\nsignal of the degenerate transverse optical Si\u2013Si phonon\nmode. For the bulk crystalline Si wafer, this Si peak appears\nat a Raman shift of 520 cm\u22121. A redshift \u0001lower wavenum-\nber\u0002 in the Si\u2013Si Raman peak position of the strained Si\nsamples compared to that of the reference unstrained Si\nsample indicates that a tensile stress is present in the Si cap\nlayer.4 The total peak shift of the Si\u2013Si Raman mode follow-\ning Sb ion implantation and RTA, relative to the reference\nunstrained Si peak position is shown in Fig. 1 for each set of\nstrained Si samples. In principle, strain relaxation would be\ndetected by a blueshift \u0001higher wavenumber\u0002 of the Si Ra-a\u0002Electronic mail: oreillyl@eeng.dcu.ie.\nAPPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS 92, 233506 \u00012008\u0002\n0003-6951\/2008\/92\u000223\u0001\/233506\/3\/$23.00 \u00a9 2008 American Institute of Physics92, 233506-1\nDownloaded 30 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132.

However, in Fig. 1 we clearly see a redshift of the\nSi\u2013Si phonon mode peak position relative to the implanted\ncase, at annealing temperatures of 600 and 700 \u00b0C. At\n800 \u00b0C a net redshift is still observed although it is less than\nfor the lower annealing temperatures. Conventionally, this\nredshift of the Si\u2013Si Raman phonon mode peak position ob-\nserved in all samples after RTA would be attributed to an\nincrease in tensile strain.4 Reciprocal space maps were ob-\ntained using HRXRD in order to gain strain information for\nthe samples independently from micro-Raman spectroscopy.\nThe 422 reflection in glancing-incidence geometry was mea-\nsured according to the procedure reported by Erdtmann and\nLangdo.10 Our HRXRD measurements have shown that\nslight strain relaxation occurs during RTA at all temperatures\nin our range of interest. This is consistent with work recently\npublished on misfit strain relaxation in strained Si.11 We pro-\npose that a further contribution to the Raman redshift arising\nfrom the high doping levels in the sample obscures any Ra-\nman blueshift due to strain relaxation, accounting for this\ndisagreement between HRXRD and micro-Raman tech-\nniques.\nIn Figs. 2\u0001a\u0002 and 2\u0001b\u0002, the absolute Raman redshift rela-\ntive to the Si Raman peak position of the as-implanted\nsample is plotted alongside the peak donor carrier concentra-\ntions measured as a function of dose for strained and un-\nstrained samples. A Hall scattering correction factor of 1.0,\nestimated from MEIS was applied to all the Sb doped\nsamples. For all doses, the experimental points are for the\nsamples annealed at 700 \u00b0C for which we obtained our op-\ntimum electrical results. In the strained case, we find the\nmaximum level of Sb activation at a dose of 6\u00011014 cm\u22122.\nThe largest absolute Raman redshift of 1.53\u00030.06 cm\u22121 is\nalso detected for this sample. The Sb deactivation at higher\ndoses, likely due to the formation of Sb clusters or precipi-\ntates, results in a reduction in the peak carrier concentration\nthat is mirrored by a decrease in the absolute Raman redshift.\nIn the unstrained samples \u0003Fig. 2\u0001b\u0002\u0004 the peak carrier concen-\ntrations and values of the absolute Raman redshift are again\nseen to follow similar trends. This supports our assertion that\nour measured Raman shift for these samples is correlated to\nhigh doping levels and not to strain. In the unstrained case\nwe do not have a sharp maximum in the mid-dose range,\nwhich we believe is caused in the strained case by an in-\ncrease in the solubility of Sb with strain present. A detailed\ndiscussion of our electrical data has been published\nelsewhere.1,12 By way of example, if we apply conventional\nSi Raman strain theory4 to the maximum Raman shift of\n\u22121.5 cm\u22121, such a shift would indicate an increase in\ntensile stress by \u0005375 MPa, which is clearly at odds with\nHRXRD reciprocal space map measurements. In any case\nthe introduction of large Sb atoms should lower the tension\nin the upper strained Si layer. From the minimum values\nof peak carrier concentration and their corresponding\nRaman redshifts, we propose that the use of micro-Raman\nspectroscopy to directly measure strain in n-doped samples\nis limited to samples with electron carrier concentrations\n\u00045\u00011019 cm\u22123. For higher net doping levels, a correction\nmust be applied by utilizing either electrical or strain data\nindependently obtained from Raman spectroscopy. Thus, the\ncombination of Raman spectroscopy with either the differen-\ntial Hall technique or HRXRD yields information on both\nstrain and doping levels in these samples. For nominally un-\ndoped samples, we find micro-Raman spectroscopy to be a\nfast and effective method for direct strain characterization\nwith high spatial resolution.\nAn early study13 on the dependence of the first-order\nRaman frequency of Si on carrier concentration N \u0001cm\u22123\u0002\nfound that doping alters the lattice deformation potential\nof Si, resulting in an effective softening of the lattice\ngiving lower phonon vibrational frequencies \u0001Raman red-\nshifts\u0002 at higher carrier concentrations. This effect has also\nbeen experimentally observed in nanocrystalline14 and\npolycrystalline15 Si films. The following expression was de-\nveloped in the case of n-type bulk Si:13\n103\u0001\u0005\u0006\/\u0006\u0002 = \u2212 0.025X\u00011 + 0.02X2\/3\u0002, X = 10\u221219N , \u00011\u0002\nwhere \u0006 is the wavenumber of the doped Si Raman peak and\nin our case \u0005\u0006 is the absolute Raman shift relative to the\nimplanted unstrained or strained Si peak position, respec-\ntively. This absolute Raman shift for bulk and strained Si\nsamples doped by Sb ion implantation during 10 s RTA at\n700 \u00b0C is plotted in Fig. 3 as a function of peak carrier\nconcentration as measured by the differential Hall technique.\nQualitatively, the data follow the theory in Ref. 13\u2014the ab-\nsolute value of the relative Raman Si peak becoming more\nredshifted as a function of increasing carrier concentration.\nThis theory is subject to adjustment due to an error in the\nvalue of the deformation potential of the Si conduction band\nused by the authors,16 which may account for some of the\ndifference between the theory and our experimental data. A\nlinear fit of bulk and strained Si data points indicates that the\ntheory developed for bulk Si may also be applied to strained\nFIG. 1.

However, Raman frequencies in strained Si are slightly\ndifferently affected by the carrier concentration compared to\nbulk Si as on average we observe larger Raman redshifts for\nstrained samples compared to bulk samples with similar dop-\ning levels. This may be related to the preferential occupation\nof the two out-of-plane conduction band valleys with respect\nto the four in-plane valleys in strained Si.17 However, at this\nstage of our investigations, we do not rule out additional\nsources of Raman redshift in the strained Si samples.\nIn summary, a direct correlation has been found between\nthe relative frequency of the Si Raman peak and the electron\ncarrier concentration. Caution must therefore be exercised\nwhen using micro-Raman spectroscopy to extract strain in-\nformation from samples with electron carrier concentrations\n\u00075\u00011019 cm\u22123. For such cases, we recommend the use of\nan independent strain measurement technique such as\nHRXRD. However, this Raman effect could prove to be a\nuseful nondestructive means of extracting carrier concentra-\ntion information from very thin, highly doped strained Si\nlayers desirable for future CMOS devices.\nScience Foundation Ireland is gratefully acknowledged\nfor funding this project under the Investigator Programme\nGrant Scheme Project 05\/IN\/I656.
