Lanfranc singles out for\nspecial treatment thirty-five feasts of the temporal and sanctoral cycles and\ndivides them into three ranks: five, including Easter and Christmas, to be\ncelebrated with the utmost grandeur, fifteen to be kept with almost as much\nmagnificence and another fifteen to be observed with somewhat less\nsplendour. Gregory\u2019s natal feast is placed in the second group, together\nwith that of Augustine, here designated the \u2018archbishop of the English\u2019. Thus\nfar the treatment given to Gregory\u2019s cult is in keeping with that of Lanfranc\u2019s\nCluniac models,2 but the text then goes on to state that Gregory\u2019s feast is to\nbe accorded this distinguished rank because he is \u2018our \u2013 that is, the English\npeople\u2019s \u2013 apostle \u2019.3 With these words this authoritarian and sometimes\noppressive4 Norman prelate would appear to have embraced a saint\u2019s cult\nthat was dear to his English subjects. There is the possibility, of course, that\nthey were interpolated into the text soon after the archbishop\u2019s death, for all\nof the surviving manuscripts were produced after his pontificate.5 But even\nif we allow for this relatively unlikely scenario, this gloss will still have\noriginated at Christ Church and has still to be seen as a reflection of the\narchbishopric\u2019s intentions that demands explanation.\n1992, 95\u2013108, but to no great effect.

The argument is not, however, that the archbishopric of York was,\nas one might well assume,6 the primary target.\nTo be sure, the defence of Canterbury\u2019s position in the primacy dispute\n\u2018proper\u2019 required due respect for and much reference to Gregory\u2019s role in\nthe foundation of the English Church, as, for example, in the tract which\nArchbishop Ralph d\u2019Escures (1114\u201322) prepared for presentation to Pope\nCalixtus II (1119\u201324),7 and in the papal privileges which Canterbury forged as\na last resort.8 But promoting Gregory\u2019s cult could do little to enhance\nCanterbury\u2019s position in this conflict. For, as the papal privilege which\nCalixtus issued in 1120 confirmed,9 York\u2019s insistence on equality was more in\nkeeping with Gregory\u2019s plans than were Canterbury\u2019s pretensions to lordship\nover the northern province. Gregory had envisaged two archbishoprics of\nequal status, one based at London the other at York,10 and special pleading\n6 Cf. A. T. Thacker, \u2018Memorializing Gregory the Great : the origins and transmission of\na papal cult \u2019, Early Medieval Europe vii (1998), 59\u201384, esp. pp. 76\u20137, who suggests that the cult\nwas first promoted by Archbishop Theodore in his efforts to \u2018make good his claim to be\narchbishop of Britain \u2019. See likewise idem, \u2018Peculiaris patronus noster : the saint as patron of the\nstate in the early Middle Ages \u2019, in J. R. Maddicott and D. M. Palliser (eds), The medieval state :\nessays presented to James Campbell, London 2000, 1\u201324, esp. pp. 17\u201322. But given Gregory\u2019s plans\nfor the organisation of the English Church it could be argued that the development of the cult\nowed more to northern resistance to such designs that to the pretensions of Canterbury.\nCertainly, Northumbrian centres, not least the monastery of Whitby where the earliest Vita of\nGregory was written between 704 and 714, figure prominently in the cult\u2019s emergence in the\nlate seventh and early eighth-century : Liber beati et laudabilis viri Gregorii pape urbis Rome de vita\natque eius virtutibus (BHL 3637), ed.

Lanfranc attempted\nto deny its relevance by arguing that it pertained only to the status of\nthe bishoprics of York and London, not to that of Canterbury.11 Eadmer,\ndeveloping Lanfranc\u2019s explanation, made Richard de Belmeis, bishop of\nLondon (1108\u201327), attempt to assert seniority over Thomas II, archbishop\nof York (1108\u201314), at Henry I\u2019s Christmas court in 1109 on the basis of\nthis \u2018 institutio beati Gregorii Anglorum apostoli \u2019.12 But the strength of\nCanterbury\u2019s case always lay, however much its proponents may have at-\ntempted to flesh out the argument with the pope\u2019s teachings, not in Gregory\u2019s\nintentions for the English Church but in historical realities, not least the\nlordship that the pre-Conquest archbishops, most notably Theodore (668\u201390)\nand Oda (941\u20138), could be shown, on the authority of Bede and of other\npre-Conquest historical texts, to have achieved over York.13 When it came\nto fighting York\u2019s attempts to escape Canterbury\u2019s jurisdiction there was\nlittle to be gained by promoting the cult of St Gregory.\nIt is the argument of this essay that the primary targets of Lanfranc and\nAnselm\u2019s interest in the cult were the abbot and monks of St Augustine\u2019s\nAbbey. Located just outside the walls of Canterbury, this monastery was\nattempting to win greater status and an exemption from the jurisdiction of\nits bishop on the grounds that such privileges were due to the resting place of\nthe apostle of the English. Promoting Gregory\u2019s cult provided Lanfranc and\nAnselm with powerful means of contesting the abbey\u2019s claims, for it had been\na long-established tradition of the Anglo-Saxon Church that Gregory, not\nAugustine, was the nation\u2019s apostle. It was in the context of this struggle over\nepiscopal and apostolic authority that the cult had much to offer these\nNorman prelates. It will be useful to begin by examining the role that\napostolic saints\u2019 cults played in the articulation of claims to status and\nauthority in the medieval Church.\nApostolic cults in the Middle Ages\nThe meaning of the concept \u2018apostle \u2019 has been contested throughout its\nhistory. In its broadest sense the term refers to missionaries who establish\nbranches of the Church in areas previously untouched by the faith. Abbo\nof Saint-Germain-des-Pre\u00b4s refers to apostles as \u2018 forging sheepfolds of\n11 The letters of Lanfranc, archbishop of Canterbury, ed. H. Clover and M.

For Paul, the apostle was a missionary sent by Christ himself :\nonly someone who had received a personal commission from the risen Christ\ncould be his apostle.16 For Luke, there could only be twelve apostles. He\ndescribes how Jesus \u2018called his disciples, and chose from them twelve, whom\nhe named apostles \u2019.17 Later, he presents Judas Iscariot\u2019s betrayal of Jesus as a\nrejection of his apostolic office, and has St Matthew elected to take his place\nin the twelve.18 In the Middle Ages attempts both to extend and to restrict the\napplication of the concept were many and various.19 Some founding fathers\nwere held to be apostles commissioned, after the fashion of St Paul, through a\nvision of Jesus Christ himself. Others were held to be apostolic in as much as\nthey were disciples chosen by the original twelve, as in the case of St Julian,\nsupposed founder of the see of Le Mans. It was alleged that the Apostle Peter\nhad called him \u2018 into the number of the seventy disciples \u2019 and sent him forth\nto Gaul \u2018 to preach and carry out the pontifical office\u2019.20 In his desperation to\nraise St Martial of Limoges to apostolic status, Ade\u00b4mar of Chabannes even\nattempted to define as apostles all the seventy-two disciples whom Luke says\nwere sent forth by Christ.21 From the eighth century, moreover, the term was\n14 \u2018Christianitatis ouilia cuderent \u2019 : Sermo de fundamento et incremento christianitatis, \u00b713, ed.\nUte O\u00a8nnerfors, in Abbo von Saint-Germain-des-Pre\u00b4s, 22 Predigten : Kritische Ausgabe und Kommentar,\nFrankfurt-am-Main 1985, 136.\n15 Acts xiv. 13 ; Philippians ii. 25 ; Romans xvi. 7 ; 1 Corinthians ix. 5.

In this way, the\nmissionaries Patrick and Boniface came to be recognised as the apostles of\nthe Irish and Germans respectively.\nBehind these struggles over definition lay conflicts over status and\nauthority. In the primitive period claims to apostolic authority conferred\ngreat power over the direction of the Church since, after Christ\u2019s ascent to\nheaven, there were no higher authority figures. \u2018God has appointed in the\nchurch\u2019, writes Paul, \u2018first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then\nworkers of miracles, then healers, helpers, administrators, speakers in various\nkinds of tongues \u2019.22 In Paul\u2019s conception, the apostles stood above the\nChristian community, subject only to Christ\u2019s judgement, and empowered to\ndemand obedience from all Christians.23 Moreover, debates over who had\nbeen an apostle continued to resound down through the history of the\nChurch, because questions about the position of churches within the\nelaborate structure of dioceses, provinces, vicariates and patriarchates that\nevolved from the second century were often decided by reference to the rank\nof their founding fathers in the hagiological hierarchy. Churches founded by\napostles \u2013 especially those that possessed their relics and in which they were,\ntherefore, still \u2018present \u2019 in their shrines \u2013 were entitled to the deference of\nthose founded by martyrs or confessors, or so those who stood to benefit from\nthis approach to ecclesiology argued. Since there was no higher kind of saint,\nthere was no better trump card than an apostolic cult. All the important\nbishoprics had an apostolic founder or forged historical narratives to this\neffect where they were lacking. Most notoriously, the see of Constantinople\nfabricated the legend that it had been founded by the Apostle Andrew, the\nfirst disciple, so that its claim to patriarchal status could be made stronger\nthan that of Rome.24\nClaims to apostolic status figure strongly, if with less frequency and finality,\namong the arguments used to justify primacy within the monastic order. In\nFrance and Italy possession of the relics of St Benedict of Nursia, the author\nof the rule that had become the basis of western monasticism, formed the\nbasis of the two most successful arguments. In France, Fleury claimed from\nthe ninth century to have acquired Benedict\u2019s body from Montecassino by\nfurta sacra, and in 997, because Benedict was the dux of monasticism, Pope\nGregory V issued a privilege that declared the abbot of Fleury \u2018primus inter\nabbates Gallie \u2019.25 In Italy, Montecassino maintained that it was still in\n22 1 Cor. xii. 28 ; cf.

Mostert, \u2018Die\n24 PAUL HAYWARD\npossession of Benedict\u2019s body, and in 1059 Pope Nicholas II confirmed the\nabbey\u2019s right to a primacy over all monasteries.26 During the eleventh\ncentury, however, custody of relics of alleged apostles became the basis of\nseveral new claims to primacy among the monastic order in southern France,\nsuch as that developed by the abbey of St Martial of Limoges.27\nMuch was at stake in these struggles. Primacy of rank brought concrete\nadvantages, many of which are illustrated by the contents of the papal\nprivilege that Fulda obtained from Leo IX in 1049.28 This bull represents\nthe culmination of a long campaign to secure primatial status among the\nmonasteries of Germany, pursued in large part through forgery and mani-\npulation, successive popes having been persuaded to endorse grants that their\npredecessors had not made.29 It confers on the abbot of Fulda \u2018a primacy\nof seating\u2019 before the other abbots of Germany and Gaul in all places and\nat all meetings. This was far from being an insignificant privilege. Synods\nwere chaired by the bishop with primatus sedendi. He could direct and control\nthe course of their deliberations; he had the right to announce his opinion\nfirst and could thus provide a lead for the lesser prelates who had to speak\nafter him.30 The abbot of the first monastery exercised an analogous role,\nbeing seated in close proximity to the presiding bishop at meetings of both\nabbots and bishops and taking charge when the abbots met separately to\nconsider their opinion.31 The bull also confers on the abbot of Fulda the\nright to wear the pontifical mitre and sandals while celebrating mass \u2013 to\nclaim the rank if not the powers of a bishop.32 It grants the monastery an\nexceptionally thorough exemption from the jurisdiction of its diocesan: no\npriest, certainly not the bishop, is to have ditio or authority in the abbey; the\nbishop is not to perform consecrations or to say mass in the monastery except\nUrkundenfa\u00a8lschungen Abbos von Fleury\u2019, in Fa\u00a8lschungen im Mittelalter, MGH Schriften xxxiii,\nHanover 1988, iv. 287\u2013318. 26 PL cxliii. 1306, no. 3.\n27 The challenge to the status of other churches was clear to the abbey\u2019s critics : Ade\u00b4mar,\nEpistola de apostolatu s.

In England, however, there does\nnot appear to have been any serious interest in realising the potential of such\ncults until the eleventh century.\nThe apostles of the English\nUntil the eleventh century there was a broad consensus that Pope Gregory\nthe Great, a saint whose bodily relics were not claimed by any English\nchurch, was the \u2018apostle of the English\u2019. Gregory had played a guiding role in\nthe conversion of the English.34 In 596, driven by the belief that it was his\nduty to ensure that all peoples had received the Gospel before the impending\napocalypse, he chose Augustine, then a monk at the monastery of St Andrew\nin Rome, to head a mission to convert the Anglo-Saxons. After some\nprevarication and delay, Augustine arrived in England in 597, having been\nconsecrated a bishop at Arles. Within four years, he had secured the\nconversion of \u00c6thelberht, the king of Kent, and set about creating a struc-\nture for the new English Church, establishing his cathedral at Canterbury,\nthe leading city in \u00c6thelberht\u2019s kingdom. This cathedral later became a\nmetropolitan see when the Roman mission to England was unable to realise\nGregory the Great\u2019s plan of making London the seat of the southern of\nEngland\u2019s two provinces. Augustine also began building the monastery out-\nside the walls of the city whichwould later come to be known as St Augustine\u2019s.\nIt was here that he was buried when he died in about 604.\nGiven that Gregory never visited Britain, Augustine, the actual leader of\nthe mission, might seem to be the most obvious candidate for recognition as\nthe English apostle, yet from the start and without apparent dispute this title\nwas accorded to Gregory among Anglo-Saxons north and south of the\nHumber. For the Southumbrian poet Aldhelm he was \u2018our teacher, ours I\nsay, who removed the error of filthy heathenism from our parents and\n33 On the scope and implications of claims to exemption in this period see now B.

The records of\nthe 747 Council of Clovesho suggest, indeed, that Augustine\u2019s cult first\nemerged on the coat-tails of Gregory\u2019s cult. Canon 17 calls for his depositio (26\nMay) to be celebrated everywhere along with Gregory\u2019s natalis (12 March)\nand for Augustine\u2019s name to be recited in litanies after that of Gregory.\nGregory is designated \u2018papa et pater ad populus anglorum\u2019, Augustine as\n\u2018beatus pater et doctor noster \u2019.44 This canon was not widely obeyed \u2013 litanies\nin pre-Conquest liturgical books rarely have Augustine immediately after\nGregory45 \u2013 but that only helps to show how much further behind was the\nformer\u2019s cult. That Gregory\u2019s name was already being widely invoked in\nEnglish litanies is clear \u2013 the Whitby Life states as much.46 \u2018St Augustine\u2019s \u2019\ndid not, finally, gain currency as a name for the abbey until the ninth\ncentury: its usual name was \u2018St Peter\u2019s \u2019 after the original dedication to SS\nPeter and Paul, and this designation continued to be used until the early\ntwelfth century.47 The earliest evidence, none of it particularly solid, that St\nAugustine\u2019s Abbey was attempting to present its founder and patron as the\nanglorum apostolus dates from the mid-eleventh century.48 The earliest arguably\nauthentic charter in the abbey\u2019s archives to describe him as such is a grant\nattributed to Archbishop Eadsige (1042\u201350).49 Augustine is designated,\n43 See n. 141 below.\n44 Councils and ecclesiastical documents relating to Great Britain and Ireland, ed.

It is worth asking whether this book\nbelonged to St Augustine\u2019s, for William Thorne, Chronica de rebus gestis abbatum S. Augustini\nCantuari\u00e6 iii. 17, ed. R. Twysden, in Scriptores X, London 1652, cols 1753\u20132226 at col. 1772, shows\nknowledge of this canon, though his version of the text denotes Gregory as \u2018pope\u2019 and\nAugustine as anglorum apostolus.

Repeated reference to the saint leads the editor to\ninfer that this notice was drawn up at the abbey. It is possible that it was \u2018 redrafted\u2019 to include\n28 PAUL HAYWARD\nlikewise, as \u2018pastor apostolicus anglorum\u2019 and Gregory as \u2018presul apostolice\nsedis \u2019 in a Ramsey saint\u2019s Life that was adapted with little alteration from a\nLife of St Mildrith composed at the abbey between 1030 and 1061.50 This lost\nLife may well have been part of a much larger cycle of texts later rendered\nredundant by that produced by Goscelin and subsequently jettisoned.\nThe evidence is not irrefutable, but the monks appear to have followed the\nrest of the English Church in regarding Gregory as the English apostle until\nthe mid-eleventh century. The introductory rubric to the abbey\u2019s tenth-\ncentury copy of John the Deacon defines his work as the \u2018Vita sancti Gregorii\npontificis et anglorum gentis apostoli \u2019.51 The contents of the calendar in the\nBosworth psalter suggest, likewise, that the identity of the English apostle was\nnot an issue at the moment between 988 and about 1016 when it was\nproduced at the abbey.52 Gregory figures as \u2018BEATUS GREGORIUS\nPAPA\u2019. Augustine\u2019s natal feast is entered in majuscules with the title\nusual for this period: \u2018SANCTUS AUGUSTINUS ARCHIEPISCOPUS\nANGLORUM PRIMUS\u2019.53 It is possible that the change at St Augustine\u2019s\nthese references, since the surviving copy was produced in the thirteenth century.

A statement to the effect that Mildrith\u2019s\nrelics rest before the abbey\u2019s high altar, between the cancelli (ibid. 93), indicates that the Life of\nMildrith on which this passio depends was composed between 1030, when they were brought to\nthe abbey, and the reign of Abbot Wulfric (1045\u201361), when, according to Goscelin, Historia\ntranslationis S.

Orchard, \u2018The Bosworth psalter and the St Augustine\u2019s\nmissal \u2019, in Eales and Sharpe, Canterbury and the Conquest, 87\u201394, has now overturned all but one\nof the arguments for Christ Church provenance offered by M. Korhammer in \u2018The origin of\nthe Bosworth psalter \u2019, Anglo-Saxon England ii (1973), 173\u201387. The remaining argument is easily\ndispatched: given Augustine\u2019s belated emergence as apostolus anglorum, the failure to use this\nepithet cannot be taken as \u2018clear proof \u2019 (ibid. 178) that this calendar has a Christ Church and\nnot a St Augustine\u2019s origin. The terminus ad quem for the production of the calendar is often\nplaced in 1008, given that Edward the Martyr\u2019s feast was entered under 17 March and later\nerased while the provision requiring celebration of the feast on 18 March is first attested in one\nmanuscript of the Enham code of 1008: V \u00c6thelred 15\u201316, Councils and synods, I\/2, 353\u20134. It\nappears, however, that the manuscript of this law code was subjected to revision by Bishop\nWulfstan II. If so, there can be no certainty that 18 March was the prescribed date prior to\nCnut\u2019s accession in 1016: see now P.

This calendar has additions which suggest\nGREGORY THE GREAT AS \u2018APOSTLE OF THE ENGL I SH \u2019 29\nwas inspired by the example of Limoges : Ade\u00b4mar\u2019s attempt to present\nMartial as an apostle reached its first climax in the late 1020s, shortly before\nthe English abbey appears to have begun its own project ; England enjoyed\ngood communications with Aquitaine during Cnut\u2019s reign,54 and Martial\nappears among the apostles in the litanies found in several service books\ncopied in England in the early eleventh century.55\nIt is worth noting also that the inception of the abbey\u2019s campaign to make\nAugustine the anglorum apostolus coincides with other signs of renewal. In\nabout 1030 Abbot \u00c6lfstan had the relics of St Mildrith, a seventh-century\nabbess of Minster-in-Thanet, translated to the abbey. This translation\nlegitimised his largely successful effort to reassemble and obtain the extensive\nendowments of her now extinct monastery.56 With these lands the abbey\nachieved an equality of resources with the cathedral priory,57 and its attempt\nto reclaim the minster\u2019s once valuable share of the tolls on ships using the\nWantsum Channel brought it into direct competition with the priory, which\nowned the port of Sandwich. Richard Sharpe has suggested, furthermore,\nthat \u00c6lfstan chose 18 May for the translation of Mildrith\u2019s relics in 1030 so\nthat the abbey might have a festival on that date which would compete in\nfuture years with the natal feast of St Dunstan that Christ Church celebrated\non 19 May.58 An attitude of rivalry also seems to have taken hold at the\ncathedral priory at this time: Eadui Basan ignored certain prominent saints of\nthe abbey, along with those of other communities, and gave Augustine\u2019s feast\na lower grading than that of Dunstan when he compiled the calendar of the\nArundel psalter.59 In the late 1040s, furthermore, the abbey began investing\nthat it was produced at Christ Church, namely, several entries for the translation of St\n\u00c6lfheah (8, 11, 14 June) and for the obits of two archbishops of Canterbury, \u00c6lfric and Lyfing\n(6 May, 12 June). It omits to add Mildrith\u2019s translatio (18 May).\n54 See G.

Abbot Wulfric (1045\u201361) remodelled the crossing\nof the abbey church to accommodate a massive octagonal rotunda of the\ntype then fashionable in Lotharingia.60\nIndirect evidence suggests that the campaign to make Augustine the\nanglorum apostolus was taken up by the Norman abbots, Scolland (1072\u201387) and\nGuy (1087\u20131093r1106).61 Scolland seems to have secured some recognition\nfor the abbey\u2019s primacy. His attestation is placed at the head of the list of\nabbots appended to the proceedings of the 1072 Council of London, which\nwas much concerned with questions of rank,62 even though most of the\nabbots present had been appointed before him.63 His attestation appears in\nthe same position in the record of the 1075 Council of London,64 and in a\nroyal charter of 1081 for Bury St Edmund\u2019s the authenticity of which is no\nlonger in doubt.65 Guy also exercised the privilege of having his name\nrecorded first.66 This was a new dignity \u2013 prior to 1072 the ranking of the\nabbots in witness lists had been determined by their length of service.67\nScolland also began rebuilding the abbey, a project which was continued\nby Guy, who translated the relics of the abbey\u2019s saints to the new church in\n1091.68 Unfortunately, it is only for the first two decades of the twelfth century\nhistory of the church at Canterbury, Leicester 1984, 264\u20135.

In the preface to Historia minor, Goscelin explains that these texts were\nproduced so that the religious of England\u2019s other churches could rejoice over the saint\u2019s\nachievement \u2018with native love as much as the daughter of their protoparent \u2019 \u2013 i.e. as much as\nSt Augustine\u2019s.

The central work of the cycle, the Historia\ntranslationis S. Augustini, was certainly completed between 1100 and 1109, since\nit is addressed to Anselm who died in 1109, and alludes to the foundation of\nthe kingdom of Jerusalem in 1099.79 Much of the cycle was probably\ncompleted along with it. The dating of forgeries is always an uncertain\nbusiness,80 but this decade also appears the most likely occasion for the\nproduction of the eight charters preserved in BL, MS Cotton Vespasian B.xx,\none of two surviving compendia of Goscelin\u2019s works for the abbey. The book\nwas copied in or close to the second decade of the twelfth century. Its con-\ntents comprise the chief components of the cycle together with copies, on fos\n2rv and 277r\u201384v, of the Bulla plumbea, of two of \u00c6thelberht\u2019s supposed\ncharters and of the five alleged papal privileges.81 None of these alleged\ndiplomas survives in an earlier manuscript.82 There is, furthermore, a strong\ncase for associating the production of both the forgeries and Goscelin\u2019s cycle\nwith the legal proceedings which the abbey initiated against Archbishop\nAnselm in late 1106 or 1107.83\n77 Historia maior de miraculis Augustini, \u00b714, p. 400.\n78 Hist. trans.

Levison, England and the continent in the\neighth century, Oxford 1946, 174\u2013233, argues that the ten most important documents were all\nforged around 1070; Gibson, Lanfranc, 169\u201370, implies that the campaign began well before\nLanfranc\u2019s arrival in 1070; S. E. Kelly, \u2018Some forgeries in the archive of St Augustine\u2019s Abbey,\nCanterbury\u2019, in Fa\u00a8lschungen im Mittelalter, iv. 347\u201370, and Charters of St Augustine\u2019s, pp. lxii\u2013lxxi,\nargues for an extended process of forgery and revision beginning in the 1060s and continuing\ninto the twelfth century. An exception is M. Chibnall, \u2018From Bec to Canterbury: Anselm and\nmonastic privilege\u2019, Anselm Studies : An Occasional Journal i (1983), 30\u20131, 35, who inclines towards\na date in the first decade of the twelfth century.\n81 For recent accounts of the manuscript see Charters of St Augustine\u2019s, pp. lxiv, xxxix\u2013xl ;\nRollason, Mildrith, 104 ; Sharpe, \u2018Goscelin\u2019s Augustine and Mildreth \u2019, 506\u20137.\n82 Their \u2018prior existence \u2019 might be presumed from Goscelin\u2019s references to charters of\nKing \u00c6thelberht (Hist. trans. Augustini ii. 26, p. 440) and King Eadbald (ibid. ii. 9, p. 434), since\nthe charters attributed to these rulers now extant among the abbey\u2019s muniments are forgeries :\nCharters of St Augustine\u2019s, nos 1\u20133, 5. But his references are not precise enough to rule out the\npossibility that he knew earlier versions of these documents destroyed when the present items\nwere produced. It is entirely possible, moreover, that he worked alongside the forgers.\n83 Exactly when this particular conflict broke out is unclear. Eadmer, Historia novorum,\n188\u20139, introduces the story once he has completed his account of the synod which settled the\ninvestiture dispute in August 1107, but he appears to compress events. Allowance needs to be\nmade for an extensive correspondence with Rome, and it is likely that the two conflicts ran in\nparallel to each other. Thomas of Elmham, a fifteenth-century monk of the abbey, preserves\nHenry I\u2019s notification of Hugh\u2019s election and dates it to 1106, but his chronology is often\nflawed: Historia monasterii S. Augustini, 31, 366; cf. RRAN ii, no. 871. It is possible that Hugh was\nelected years earlier. John of Worcester, Chronicon, ed. and trans. R. R. Darlington, P. McGurk\nand J. Bray (OMT, 1995\u2013 ), iii. 64, places the obit of his predecessor, Guy, in 1093, implying\nGREGORY THE GREAT AS \u2018APOSTLE OF THE ENGL I SH \u2019 33\nThe abbey protested to the royal court against Anselm\u2019s insistence that\nGuy\u2019s successor, Abbot Hugh de Flori (1108\u201326r27) be consecrated before\nthe high altar in the cathedral. Eadmer\u2019s account, if it can be trusted, shows\nthat deficiencies in the documents then deployed by the abbey were exposed\nduring the court proceedings. According to Eadmer, the abbey at first\nclaimed to have privileges validating its right to have the abbot consecrated\nin its own church, but these were found to be \u2018nullus vel non ratus \u2019, \u2018non-\nexistent or un-proven\u2019, and had to be \u2018condemned\u2019, but its advocates were\nstill able to persuade the king that it had been the custom to consecrate the\nabbot in his own church. Anselm refused to carry out this ruling. The ensuing\nimpasse appears to have lasted for several years, during which time Anselm\nobtained help from Rome. Pope Paschal II wrote to Henry no less than three\ntimes, instructing him to have Hugh blessed without delay lest the abbey\nshould succumb to rack and ruin.84 A compromise was finally reached in\nthe final months of 1107 or in January 1108. Anselm offered to perform the\nblessing in the chapel of the bishop of Rochester\u2019s house at Lambeth,\nwhere he was then staying. The king accepted his offer, and Hugh was duly\nblessed there on 27 February 1108. Given that the bishopric of Rochester\nwas the property of the archbishop and that Lambeth was already the\narchbishop\u2019s usual London residence,85 this was an outcome fraught with\nambiguity. The abbey was to achieve a much clearer victory in 1120. Pope\nCalixtus II, in the same month that he issued his devastating privilege for\nYork, authorised another validating the papal privileges that the abbey\nhad presented to him and wrote directly to Archbishop Ralph expressly\nfreeing St Augustine\u2019s from the symbols of its subjection: the monks were not\nto be required to make payments in return for chrism or to ring their bells\nfor the canonical hours only when Christ Church had done so first.86\nthat the abbacy was vacant for over fourteen years. This seems improbably long, but John\u2019s\ndating is not contradicted by other evidence: Guy appears in the witness-lists of RRAN i, nos\n286 (a forgery), 315 (issued at Dover on 27 Jan. 1091) and 318 (a forgery). See D. Knowles,\nC. N. L. Brooke and V. C. M. London, The heads of religious houses, England and Wales, 940\u20131216,\n2nd edn, Cambridge 2001, 36. It is worth asking whether Hugh was elected in 1100 or 1101, for\nin the first two years of his reign Henry I, keen to secure his shaky position, filled all the eleven\nother ecclesiastical vacancies which William Rufus had left outstanding at his death: L.

As Douglas comments (p. 6), the payment\nwas to be made \u2018with particular solemnity, the money being either placed upon the high altar\n34 PAUL HAYWARD\nThis victory was probably achieved, in part at least, by investing considerable\neffort in the \u2018 improvement\u2019 of the abbey\u2019s arsenal of documents and\nhistorical records in the interval between Hugh\u2019s election and its appeal to\nPope Calixtus.\nGoscelin\u2019s cycle and the forgeries now extant are likely to be products\nof those efforts. Three passages in book II of Goscelin\u2019s Historia translationis\nspeak to the consecration issue. In the first Goscelin records how Abbot\nWulfric (1045\u201361) was blessed: chosen to succeed when Abbot \u00c6lfstan had\nbecome too infirm to continue, Wulfric was blessed \u2018at the apostolic altar\nof St Peter, evidently by the ancient custom of the Roman privilege\nand liberty, which was first affirmed by apostolic authority \u2019.87 In the\nsecond Goscelin says that Abbot \u00c6thelsige (1062\u201370) was consecrated in\nthe royal palace, and in the third he claims that Scolland was \u2018ordained in\nhis monastery like his predecessors \u2019.88 The contents of the cycle show, how-\never, that by claiming apostolic status for its patron the abbey hoped\nto gain not just control over where the abbot was consecrated but also\nprimatial status and all the privileges that went with it. Thus, Goscelin has\nPope Leo IX affirm the abbot\u2019s right to a primatus sedendi at the synod of\nRheims, citing his former patron Bishop Herman of Salisbury as his witness.\nBy apostolic authority Abbot Wulfric was seated after the abbot of\nMontecassino and the archbishop of Canterbury next to the cardinal\nbishop of Silva Candida.89 Pope Alexander II, likewise, is made to confer\non \u00c6thelsige the right to wear the pontifical mitre and sandals on the basis\nof Augustine\u2019s status as a representative of Rome and as an apostle of a\nparticular gens : \u2018We decree\u2019, the pope is supposed to have said, \u2018 that the\nruler of St Augustine\u2019s shall hold this honour in perpetuity on account of\nSt Augustine\u2019s dignity as a Roman alumnus and as the apostle of the\nof Christ Church, or given personally into the hands of the sacristan of that church. With less\nformality, a large supplementary render was made, and the whole transaction took place on\nThursday in Holy Week, the day on which according to ecclesiastical usage the chrism was,\nand is, bestowed\u2019. It would be nice to know when these requirements were first imposed. On\nthe matter of bell-ringing, the abbey\u2019s historians make Lanfranc responsible for compelling the\nmonks to ring the canonical hours only after Christ Church had done so first : see, for example,\nThorne, Chronica, vii. 8, 10, cols 1791\u20132.\n87 \u2018Abbatem sibi ad apostolicum S.

The Bulla plumbea, for\nexample, enjoins the archbishop not to use his right to bless the new abbot as\na means of imposing his lordship upon the abbey, and limits his ability to\ncontrol the conditions under which this and other rites would be performed.\nThe abbot is to be blessed in the abbey;91 the abbey is to be free from the\npayment of dues for customary services ; and the abbot shall have the right to\nsay when the archbishop can perform ordinations and celebrate masses\nthere. Given such comprehensive control over when bishops could perform\nconsecrations and blessings, a monastery could negotiate with its diocesan\nfrom a position of strength and could thus avoid arbitary and humiliating\ndemands for money and other services.\nLanfranc and St Augustine\u2019s Abbey\nThe reasons why the monks of St Augustine\u2019s attempted to claim apostolic\nstatus for their patron are clear enough, but there is some obscurity as to\nexactly when Lanfranc set about defeating this project. He seems to have\nbeen willing to go some way towards accommodating the abbey\u2019s aspirations\nat the beginning of his pontificate \u2013 Scolland\u2019s primacy among the abbots at\nthe 1072 Council of London could not have been achieved without his tacit\napproval.92 But certain aspects of the abbey\u2019s project are likely have proved\n90 Hist. trans.

In Charters of St Augustine\u2019s, pp. xxi\u2013xxii, and \u2018Some\nforgeries \u2019, 364 n. 66, Kelly is inclined to think this grant genuine, citing its similarity to rights\nwon by Fulda at the same synod. However, Goscelin\u2019s awareness of developments on the\ncontinent (which are amply attested in Liber confortatorius, ed. C. H. Talbot, Studia Anselmiana\nxxxvii [1955], 26\u2013117), and his skill in forging claims of this kind have to be taken into account.\nIt is moreover strange that no such grant, not even a purported grant, was entered in the\nabbey\u2019s cartularies.\n91 Charters of St Augustine\u2019s, no. 4, p. 20. Chibnall, \u2018From Bec to Canterbury\u2019, 23\u201344, argues\nthat the central issue in the present dispute was that of whether the abbot had to make a\nwritten profession or an oral vow of obedience to the archbishop, a question that was much\ndebated in Normandy during this period. But this is to put too fine a point on the matter. The\nforgeries nowhere deny the archbishop the right to extract a promise, oral or written; rather\nthey attempt to reduce his control over when and where the oath was to be made so that it\ncannot be used to make unwelcome demands. The professions made by Scolland and Guy are\nprinted by C. E. Woodruff in \u2018Some early professions of canonical obedience to the see of\nCanterbury by heads of religious houses \u2019, Archaeologia Cantiana xxxvii (1925), 53\u201372 at pp. 60\u20131.\nNo profession survives for Abbot Hugh de Flori, but this need not imply that none was ever\nmade: S.

An archbishop might sometimes tolerate exemptions in the\nother dioceses of his province, no matter how hostile a posture he might have\nto adopt in public, for the purpose of maintaining good relations with his\nbishops, for these privileges tended to generate business for his own court ;93\nbut an exempt house in his own diocese would be subject to no superior save\nthe pope.94 A would-be primate may have been particularly annoyed,\nmoreover, by the existence of such a monastery, for its special relationship\nwith the papacy stood to detract from the quasi-papal aspect of his own\nauthority. The privileges of the primacy were, as Southern explains, three-\nfold: \u2018first, the possession of permanent papal legatine authority in England;\nsecond, ecclesiastical jurisdiction over the whole of the British Isles ; and\nthird, the right to hold councils and summon to meetings participants from\nthis whole area\u2019.95 Given that Lanfranc\u2019s plan was to establish a vicariate in\nwhich matters that would otherwise have been taken to Rome would be\ndiverted to Canterbury, he is most unlikely to have indulged the abbey\u2019s\ndesire for an exemption. It follows that Lanfranc may have set about\nundermining its claims for the apostolic status of its founder as soon as the\nenormity of its primatial ambitions became clear. Leaving aside the heady\nmix of fact and propaganda put out by the Acta Lanfranci 96 and the\nanachronistic data provided by Gervase of Canterbury\u2019s Imaginationes 97 and\nthe abbey\u2019s historians,98 the foundation in about 1085 of St Gregory\u2019s\nprovides the best evidence for Lanfranc\u2019s opposition.\nveneratione et obsecratione \u2019, Revue des sciences religieuses xv (1935), 554\u201361 at p. 558. The point is\nreiterated by another Christ Church monk writing in the margins of the Eadmer\u2019s manuscript\n(CCCC, MS 371) : see ibid. n. 1.\n93 Note, for example, Pope Alexander II\u2019s privilege for Bury St Edmund\u2019s : Memorials of St\nEdmund\u2019s Abbey, ed. T. Arnold (RS xcvi, 1890\u20136), i. 343\u20137. This permitted the abbot to appeal\nto his archbishop over the head of his diocesan, and Lanfranc soon became involved in Abbot\nBaldwin\u2019s dispute with Bishop Herfast. Eadmer, Historia novorum, 132\u20133, would have his\nreaders think that Lanfranc \u2018 taking this privilege with difficulty \u2019 (\u2018moleste accipiens ipsum\nprivilegium\u2019) at first attempted to suppress it, but how could he rescind a papal bull? He might\nattempt to deploy his primatial authority but to put this to the test in direct opposition to the\npope was surely to risk a serious rebuff at a time when papal recognition for this new dignity\nwas far from secure. Indeed, in Letters, no. 47, pp. 150\u20133, he invokes the primacy not in order\nto check Baldwin\u2019s activities but in order to discipline Herfast.\n94 Knowles, Monastic order, 583 ; Chibnall, \u2018From Bec to Canterbury\u2019, 35.\n95 Portrait in a landscape, 335 (my italics) ; cf.

The obituaries focus on the\ncollege\u2019s cemetery, which was certainly an attack upon the abbey, but it is\nunlikely to have been directed against the abbey\u2019s finances, as has been\nsupposed. Assigning the canons revenues from other sources,102 Lanfranc\nmade the new cemetery open to all free of charge.103 Now it is unlikely that\na cemetery of this kind will have attracted those with the means to purchase\nthe spiritual advantages of a monastic burial. This much is confirmed by the\nrecent archaeological dig which found some 1,300 skeletons but little sign of\nThomas of Elmham\u2019sHistoria monasterii S.

For what it is worth, the foundation charter\nis attested by Scolland, abbot of St Augustine\u2019s, and would have to predate his death on 9\nSeptember 1087 if it were genuine.\n102 The college appears to have been financed initially with the rents on thirty-two houses\nin the city. These were supporting a gild of clerics in 1086, but had been assigned to the\ncollege by about 1100: Domesday Book, fo. 3a; Domesday monachorum, fo. 2v (Domesday\nmonachorum, 82) ; T.

The measure will not have detracted from the\nabbey\u2019s appeal as a burial church for the rich, but it threatened its position in\nthe hearts of the local community.\nGoscelin\u2019s Libellus contra usurpatores defends St Augustine\u2019s from the\nattempts of the canons of St Gregory\u2019s to claim possession of the body of\nSt Mildrith, one of its most important saints. By publicising their claim to\npossess her relics the canons were contesting the justice of the abbey\u2019s\npossession of the lucrative estates and rights associated with Minster-in-\nThanet.106 It is likely, however, that this move was a deviation from the\noriginal scheme. Goscelin states that two bodies were discovered at Lyminge\nand translated to St Gregory\u2019s, where they were placed side-by-side upon the\naltar. The first was treated from the outset as that of Abbess Eadburg, but\nthe identity of the second was not declared until three years later, when the\ncanons revealed that they believed the body was St Mildrith\u2019s.107 Goscelin\nalso quotes a saint\u2019s Life produced by the canons in which this purported\ntranslation is dated to 1085.108 It follows from this version of events, which is\nsupported by a set of Old English annals of Christ Church provenance that\nname Eadburg alone as having been translated to St Gregory\u2019s,109 that the\ncanons first came out in public with a claim to Mildrith\u2019s relics in 1088\/9\n\u2013 that is, during the final year of Lanfranc\u2019s life. His judgement may have\nfailed him, or he may simply have been unable to restrain the canons from\nmaking these extravagant claims. In any case, the claim and the hagiography\nwith which it was promoted played into the abbey\u2019s hands by giving Goscelin\n104 See the interim reports by T.

It is\nthe contention of this essay that the dedication to Gregory was the cutting\nedge of the original scheme.\nWhat is needed is an insight into the nature of the rhetoric involved \u2013\nfurther evidence as to the slant which the archbishopric was giving to\nGregory\u2019s cult. There survives, fortunately, a sermon that answers this need.\nPreserved in a Christ Church manuscript, it appears to have been devised\nand delivered by Lanfranc\u2019s successor, Anselm, and it defends yet another\nmeasure in support of Gregory\u2019s cult, this time a reform of the feast of\nGregory\u2019s ordination. We will examine this sermon shortly, but if we are to\navoid succumbing to mistaken assumptions that might stand in the way of a\nproper appreciation of its significance we must first attempt to unravel the\ntangled strands of evidence that bear witness to this feast and its reform.\nThe feast of the ordination of St Gregory\nThough no legislative ruling has yet come to light,114 it is clear from the\nliturgical record that the feast of Gregory\u2019s ordination was reformed at some\npoint during the late eleventh century. Idiosyncratic dates are attested,115\nbut scribes producing liturgical calendars before this time usually provide\nfor the feast\u2019s observance on or close to 29 March, those working after it\nalmost always prescribe its celebration on or close to 3 September. Of, for\nexample, the twenty-three calendars known to have been copied and used in\nEngland before about 1100,116 seven provide for its observance under this\n110 Libellus contra usurpatores, \u00b73, pp. 72\u20133. 111 Ibid. \u00b74, pp. 74\u20135.\n112 Ibid. \u00b720, pp. 88\u20139: a boy tied to a wooden sphere was placed in a vat of water, but\nwhen he failed to sink, as an affirmative outcome required, the canons tried to force him under\nwith violent punches to the back and head; when this failed they attempted to disguise the\npurpose of the ritual. The satirical dimension of the Libellus contra usurpatores warrants further\ninvestigation. 113 Vita \u00c6thelredi et \u00c6thelberti et Miltrudis et Edburgis, \u00b721, p. 108.\n114 There is, for example, no sign of the reform in the canons of the 1072 Council of\nWinchester, which attended to a couple of liturgical issues, including an alteration in the day\non which the feast of St Bartholomew was observed. The Anglo-Saxon practice of celebrating\nthis on 25 August was altered in preference for the more usual date of 24 August, which was\nfollowed in Normandy: Councils and synods, I\/2, 607, no. 91 ; M. Brett, \u2018A collection of Anglo-\nNorman councils \u2019, this JOURNAL xxvi (1975), 301\u20138 at pp. 303\u20135.\n115 The feast appears, for example, at the otherwise unparalleled (?) date of 3 August in\na \u2018very ancient \u2019 calendar from Vallombrosa, which is printed in PL cxxxviii. 1287\u201392.\n116 Twenty-one of these calendars have been printed, nineteen in Kalendars before 1100, one in\nThe missal of Robert of Jumie`ges, ed. H. A. Wilson (HBS xi, 1916), 9\u201320, and now that from the\n40 PAUL HAYWARD\ndate,117 while another five specify 30 March.118 From about 1100, on the other\nhand, the feast is found under 3 September in the vast majority of monastic\ncalendars now in print,119 and in a few more cases under 2 September.120 Of\nthese texts, only one, a late twelfth-century calendar from St Werburgh\u2019s,\nChester, prescribes the earlier date.121 The same pattern is to be observed in\nmany calendars produced on the continent, though there is, as will emerge\nbelow, a geographical divergence in the distribution of the two dates, since 29\nMarch seems to have survived longer in Germany than in France.\nI say monastic, furthermore, because the feast appears to have been\ndropped altogether at England\u2019s foremost secular church, Salisbury\nCathedral. It is true that the old day was retained in a calendar which is\none of the earliest products of the scriptorium which was established at Old\nSarum in about 1089r1091, when it became the new seat of the recently\ncombined sees of Sherborne and Ramsbury: today BL, MS Cotton Vitellius\nA.xii, fos 65v\u201371r.122 But this is probably an aberration of no great\nsignificance.

The move to Salisbury had been initiated between 1075\nand 1078 by Bishop Herman (1045\u201378), who probably intended to bring his\nBenedictine priory with him. But the new cathedral was not completed and\ndedicated until 1092, and his successor, Osmund (1078\u201399), the first Norman\nto preside over the see, installed canons in the church, reconstituting the\npriory of the old cathedral as the priory of Sherborne.124 The canons may\nhave wished to avoid lending support to Gregory\u2019s cult, since he was often\ncited as having first authorised the use of monastic communities to provide\nservices in English cathedrals.125 Indeed, books in the Sarum tradition often\naccord minor status to the 12 March feast, prescribing the propers from the\nCommon of saints rather than those exclusive to the day.126 The Vitellius\nA.xii calendar does not appear, furthermore, to have remained in use for\nvery long: it was emended only the once and soon after it was produced, to\ninclude the feast of the translation of Wulfram, a saint of the Norman\nmonastery of Fontenelle.\nPrecisely when and how the reform was introduced and promoted is far\nfrom clear. In their pioneering work on Lanfranc\u2019s liturgical policies,\nGasquet and Bishop suggested that the observance was suppressed by the\narchbishop prior to its being revived by his successors at the new date.127 But\nin this as in many other points of detail they were misled by their view that\nthe calendar of the Arundel psalter was a post-Conquest document. The\nbook is actually the work of a scribe who flourished in the 1020s and 1030s,\nEadui Basan,128 but its calendar remains significant for present purposes : that\ncapital letters were used when the reformed feast was inserted by an early\ntwelfth-century scribe helps to demonstrate the importance which Christ\n1916 : John Rylands University Library, Manchester, MS L.24 (the \u2018Crawford missal \u2019),\nwhich provides the base-text for the edition, and Bologna University Library, MS 2565 (see\nSarum missal, pp. xxi\u2013xxxii, 511\u201318). The reformed feast is present, however, in the third\nwitness, Bibliothe`que de l\u2019Arsenal, Paris, MS 135 (Sarum missal, 499\u2013510 at p. 507). Cf. V.\nLeroquais, Les Sacramentaires et les missels manuscrits des bibliothe`ques publiques de France, Paris 1924,\nii. 132\u20135).\n124 See D. E.

Sayers (eds), Tradition and change : essays in honour of Marjorie Chibnall,\nCambridge 1985, 77\u2013101.\n125 For example, Eadmer, Historia novorum, 20. It is ironic, therefore, that Lanfranc should\nhave dedicated a house of canons to St Gregory.\n126 See A. Hughes, \u2018British rhymed offices: a catalogue and commentary \u2019, in\nS.

It is entirely\npossible that Lanfranc introduced the reform, replacing the older date in a\nsingle step. The attention given to the 12 March feast in the monastic statutes\nand his decision to choose Gregory as patron of his college of canons suggest,\nafter all, that Lanfranc was attempting to promote the cult. Indeed, the feast\nof 3 September is present in a calendar which Sandy Heslop has adduced \u2013\nnow that that of the Arundel psalter no longer applies \u2013 to show that the\narchbishop did indeed purge some Anglo-Saxon observances from the\nliturgy: that is, Bodleian Library, Oxford, MS Add. C.260.130 But this cal-\nendar does not, unfortunately, constitute proof that the reform was adopted\nearly in Lanfranc\u2019s reign, since it survives as copied in the 1120s and includes\na number of observances which were probably recovered in the wake of\nLanfranc\u2019s initial purge, such as the feast of St \u00c6lfheah\u2019s passio (19 April), or\ninstituted at a later date, such as the feast of \u00c6lfheah\u2019s ordinatio (16\nNovember).131 It is residual similarities with the sanctoral cycle observed at\nBec which form the basis of Heslop\u2019s argument.\nTwo charters would appear to offer a precise terminus ad quem for the\nadoption of the new date. Issued at Windsor on 3 September in 1101, both\nmention the feast in their dating clauses.132 Richard Southern seized on these\ndocuments as a sign that the reform may have been inaugurated at this very\nmeeting of the royal court. Mention in dating clauses of the saint of the day is\nso unusual, he argues, that it would require an exceptional event such as this\nto bring it about. The attraction of this theory is that Anselm was then\nattempting to secure Henry I\u2019s acceptance of the papal decrees on investi-\ntures and he might have wished to \u2018renew the ancient bond between England\nand Rome established by Gregory the Great \u2019, giving \u2018 this Old English\nobservance \u2026 a new relevance\u2019.133 But with deference to a scholar who has\ncontributed so much to our understanding of Anselm and his times, it has\nto be said that these charters may not be so significant. They are both\nfoundation charters for religious institutions, establishing Bath and Norwich\n129 \u2018ORDINATIO SANCTI GREGORII (PAPE) \u2019 : BL, MS Arundel 155, fos 2r\u20137v\n(Kalendars before 1100, 70\u201381 at p. 178). Compare the less emphatic emendations which were\nmade to the calendar of the Leofric missal (Bodl. Lib., MS Bodley 579, fos 39r\u201344v) and to that\nof Bishop Wulfstan II\u2019s personal service book, his Portiforium (CCCC, MS 391, pp. 3\u201314) :\nKalendars before 1100, 52, 220. The calendar of Bodley 579 is now recognised as a Canterbury\nproduct, but need not have been there when this alteration was introduced: Dumville, Liturgy,\n41\u201350, 64\u20135. 130 \u2018Canterbury calendars \u2019, 53\u201385.\n131 Cf. Hayward, \u2018Translation-narratives \u2019, 70\u20133. Another irregularity is that Augustine\nappears as the anglorum apostolus, a further sign that the calendar dates from after about 1120.\n132 RRAN ii, nos 544 (\u2018apud Wyndelsoram in die ordinationis Sancti Gregorii \u2019), printed in\nMonasticon anglicanum, ed.

It is in fact\nnot unusual for charters of this kind to mention the saint of the day in their\ndating clauses, almost invariably through forgery or \u2018elaboration\u2019 by scribes\nof the house in question.134 That neither of these charters uses the same\nformula and that neither survives as an original is, therefore, crucial. Indeed,\nat least one other charter was issued at this meeting of the royal court, a grant\nof land to Norwich, and the feast is not mentioned in its dating clause.135\nThese charters have no value as evidence for the timing of the reform. The\nbest that can be said is that it was introduced during the archiepiscopates of\nLanfranc and Anselm.\nNow at first glance this reform may seem relatively insignificant, but a little\nreflection shows that it represents a considerable promotion of Gregory\u2019s\ncult. Gregory\u2019s primary feast, that of 12 March, probably provided the\nAnglo-Saxons with an opportunity to take a welcome break from Lenten\nabstinence much as the 17 March feast of St Patrick, the national saint of\nIreland, still does for some people today. Indeed, the 12 March feast was\nprescribed by the Laws of Alfred as one of four saints\u2019 days which were \u2018 to be\ngiven to all men, but not to slaves or unfree labourers \u2019.136 The 29 March\nfeast, on the other hand, was far less conveniently situated, for it is likely to\nhave clashed with the celebration of Easter in most years. A glance at the\ntables in Cheney\u2019s Handbook of dates shows that 29 March falls in the week\nimmediately before Palm Sunday, in Holy Week or within the Easter Octave\ntwo years running out of every four.137 Moving the feast to 3 September had\nthe effect, however, of moving it to a time in the church year when it could\nbe celebrated without hindrance. The new date was also in keeping with\nthe established narrative of how Gregory was appointed. His predecessor,\nPelagius II, had died during an epidemic in February 590. Gregory was\nelected soon afterwards, but had insisted upon consulting Constantinople in\nthe hope, it was claimed, that the Emperor Maurice (582\u2013602) would accept\nhis desire to retreat from the world and call for the appointment of someone\nelse. It was not until after the emperor\u2019s response had been received that he\nresigned himself to his fate. He was then consecrated in late August or early\nSeptember. This much will have been regarded as fact by readers of the\nthoroughLife in four bookswhich John theDeacon compiled for Pope John VIII\n(872\u201382), the work which had become the standard guide to Gregory\u2019s\nachievement by the end of the eleventh century.138 That its chronology is\n134 Cf.

It seems likely that the observance originated in\nEngland, given that Gregory\u2019s cult took hold there much sooner than it did in\nRome.140 The feast was certainly in existence by the 740s, for it was added to\nthe Calendar of Willibrord by a near-contemporary hand, possibly that of\nWillibrord himself,141 and it is arguably the after-life of the service books\nwhich the eighth-century Anglo-Saxon missionaries brought with them to\nthe continent that explains the earlier feast\u2019s appearance in so many\nAustrasian and East Frankish calendars. The feast appears, for example,\nunder 29 March in calendars which have been traced to Echternach,142 to\nLorsch,143 to Reichenau,144 to St Gall145 and to St Vaast.146 The older ob-\nservance even appears to have reached Italy by this route, being found in the\nx.x. 1, ed.

One theory has it that 29 March was derived erroneously from the\ndate of Gregory\u2019s election,149 another that it was originally the anniversary\nof Gregory\u2019s ordination to the priesthood.150 Neither theory is impossible,151\nbut there is a stronger possibility : that the observance arose through\nconfusion with a feast of Gregory of Nazianzus attested in Irish sources.152\nThe Fe\u00b4lire Oenguso, compiled in about 800, gives 29 March as the date of an\nunspecified feast of this saint.153 The same feast also turns up in liturgical\ncalendars from two continental monasteries, both touched by Irish influence:\nRegensburg and St Gall.154 Now this feast is no less bizarre \u2013 Gregory\n147 Bibliotheca dell \u2019 Universita`, Bologna, codex 2679, fos 4\u201310.

It should be noted, however, that ordination\nfeasts seem to occur only when the saint in question was a bishop and seem to refer almost\nexclusively to their consecration to the episcopate. This was certainly the understanding of the\nauthor of the sermon discussed below.\n151 Some impossible theories have been put forward. Richard Pfaff has twice suggested that\nthe date of 29 March was derived from that of the translation of some stolen relics of Gregory\nto St Medard, Soissons, in 826: \u2018Lanfranc\u2019s supposed purge \u2019, 104; \u2018The calendar\u2019, 68. He\ncites Odilo of St Medard, Liber de translatione reliquiarum S. Sebastiani martyris et Gregorii I pap\u00e6 (BHL\n7545), in the edition by J. Mabillon, Acta sanctorum ordinis Sancti Benedicti, 1st edn, Paris\n1668\u20131701, v. 385\u2013410, as reprinted by Migne, PL cxxxii. 579\u2013622. But this work, which was\nwritten a century after the events it describes, implies that the depositio of the relics in question\ntook place on the second Sunday in Advent in 826 (\u00b723). The second Sunday in Advent fell on\n9 December in 826, and it is under 9 December that the enshrinement is entered in the\ncalendar of the Sacramentary of Echternach (Sacramentary of Echternach, 76). As printed by\nMabillon andMigne, Odilo\u2019s work mentions no other events that might have generated a feast\non 29 March. Moreover, as its appearance in the Calendar of Willibrord demonstrates, the 29\nMarch feast predates the Soisson cult of Gregory and is in no way derived from it.

Lacking information about how the latter had been appointed pope,\nthe scribe may have guessed that this was the anniversary of his ordination.\nCertainly, the author of the Whitby Life knew very little about how and when\nGregory came to be consecrated pope.157 Having arisen in this muddled\nfashion, the festivity may then have gone on to supplant that of the obscure\nCappadocian prelate in English calendars.\nBut if it seems likely that the feast spread from England, the idea of moving\nit to a better date need not have originated there. I have been careful thus far\nto avoid saying as much, for the new feast is widely attested from about 1100\nin liturgical books from northern and eastern France \u2013 especially in those\nfrom Normandy.158 It is true that no provision is made for it in the surviving,\nthirteenth-century, missal of Bec,159 or in the calendar of St Neot\u2019s (which,\nthough located in England, was a priory of Bec) ;160 but there is much\nevidence of its adoption in liturgical books from Fe\u00b4camp,161 Jumie`ges,162\n492\u2013500 at p. 494, and the references to Stiftsbibliothek, St Gallen, MS 394 in Munding,\nKalendarien von St Gallen, i. 46; ii. 8, 47.\n155 It is worth asking whether the feast may refer to Gregory\u2019s \u2018enthronement \u2019 as patriarch\nof Constantinople, which took place on an unknown day during the months leading up to 31\nMay 381: J.

But the\npossibility that the reform originated on the continent cannot be ruled out\nuntil the provenance and date of all the service books in which it is attested\nhave been determined.165 The feast of Gregory\u2019s ordination is often regarded\nas an observance peculiar to the Anglo-Saxons,166 but by the late eleventh\ncentury this was no longer the case. It had become a regular feature of the\necclesiastical year for churches throughout western Europe, and its reform\nmight conceivably have originated at any of them. It does not affect the\nargument of the present article, however, if the reform was first mooted\noutside England. What matters are the reasons for its adoption by monastic\ncathedrals and abbeys throughout England and in Normandy. Fortunately,\nthe sermon mentioned above helps to answer this question.\nThe sermon\nThe sermon De ordinatione beati Gregorii anglorum apostoli is solely preserved\nin Eadmer of Canterbury\u2019s \u2018personal manuscript \u2019, today Corpus Christi\nCollege, Cambridge, MS 371 (at pp. 176\u201390).167 This manuscript was compiled\nby Eadmer over a long period, from about 1112 until his death in about 1130,\nbut the sermon is thought to belong to the first phase, which preceded his\ndeparture for the continent with Archbishop Ralph in 1116.168 Eadmer\u2019s\n163 For example, Bibliothe`que municipale, Avranches, MS 42, s.xiii1, fos 2v\u20138r (calendar),\n178v (sanctorale), and MS 214, s.xii\/xiii (martyrology) : J.

See also Muir and Turner,\n48 PAUL HAYWARD\nmain reason for making the book appears to have been to keep a record of his\nown works, but he also copied into it works of other writers that were relevant\nto his interests, such as the letter of Nicholas, monk and later prior of\nWorcester, on the identity of Edward the Martyr\u2019s mother (pp. 6\u20137),169 and\nthat on the relationship between Canterbury and York (pp. 7\u20139). 170 Indeed,\nthe manuscript contains a version of a sermon De beatitudine perennis vitae which\nAnselm is known from its preface to have preached (pp. 261\u201378). Eadmer\ntook down a rough copy as it was being delivered which he then revised with,\nhe says, Anselm\u2019s help and approval. Southern suggested that the present text\nalso records a sermon preached by Anselm and taken down by Eadmer,\npointing out that it uses one of the archbishop\u2019s favourite images \u2013 that of the\ncomplete man as a four-squared stone.171 There is one passage in particular\nwhich strongly suggests that the sermon was delivered by someone who was\nnot himself English:\nEia fratres \u2013 forte enim aliqui de gente illa h\u00e6c me dicentem pr\u00e6sentes\nauscultant \u2013 eia inquam uos angli, fratres nobis in Christiana fide effecti, uobis a\ndeo pr\u00e6destinatum et missum beatum Gregorium pro apostolo suscepistis, et eo per\nsuos legatos pr\u00e6dicante iugo fidei Christian\u00e6 colla uestra subiecistis.172\nThis passage certainly appears to rule out Eadmer\u2019s authorship, leaving\nAnselm as the most likely candidate;173 but whether it also indicates, as\nSouthern went on to argue, that few Englishmen were present in the\naudience and that Anselm was attempting \u2013 on their behalf \u2013 to overcome\nNorman hostility to the feast is doubtful. A close reading of the rest of the\nsermon suggests that it was directed against \u2018English\u2019 rather than Norman\nresistance to the feast.

Rather, the text refers only to the feasts of\n12 March and 3 September, contrasting them as follows:\nEst quidem alia festiuitas eius, qu\u00e6 celebratur de obitu eius, sed in illa pro meritis suis\nperenniter renaturus ad deum perrexit, in ista ad curam dominici ouilis constitutus\neos ad fidei christian\u00e6 culmen erexit. Illam semper quadragesimalis meror inuoluit,\nhanc mensis September obtinere promeruit, mensis utique etiam in ueteri lege\nceleberrimus habitus, et ubique nouorum fructuum benedictione ditatus. Qui ergo\nfestum l\u00e6tici\u00e6 beato Gregorio soluere cupit, hanc amplectatur, hanc ueneretur ; in\nhac illi nulla occursante mesticia integra su\u00e6 laudis pr\u00e6conia pendat.174\nThat no reference is made to the need to reform the celebration of Gregory\u2019s\nordinatio or to the fact that it had once been celebrated on 29 March seems to\nimply that the move had been adopted some time earlier, perhaps a decade\nor more before this sermon was devised. The homily is comprised, moreover,\nof attacks on those who were refusing to observe the new feast and of reasons\nwhy they should do so. Some of these reasons are of general application:\nGregory was a saint of consummate, \u2018 four-squared\u2019, goodness, thus he will\nshow compassion to those who celebrate his sanctity ;175 he took over from St\nPeter the burden of looking after the Lord\u2019s flock, thus the whole world is\nobliged to celebrate the day of his ordination;176 he set out a moral path for\neveryone, thus those who refuse to embrace his cult witness that they will not\naccept his guidance;177 and so on. The first half of the sermon is largely\naddressed, however, to the veneration which one group in particular, the\nEnglish, owes to Gregory.\nThe homilist begins by asserting that Gregory is the English apostle. He\noffers a reprise of the received conversion narrative complete with the legend\nof how the sale of certain Deiran slaves in Rome filled Gregory with the idea\nof bringing Christianity to England.178 He makes the point explicit : the\n174 \u2018There is, indeed, his other feast, which is celebrated on the anniversary of his death, but\nin that he passed through to God about to be reborn forever on account of his virtues ;\nconstituted in this [feast] to the care of the Lord\u2019s flock he raised them to the summit of the\nChristian faith. Lenten sorrow always enfolds the first feast. He deserved to receive this month\nof September \u2013 a month indeed held in the highest honour even under the old Law and\neverywhere enriched with the blessing of new fruits. Let him, therefore, who wishes to perform\nfor the blessed Gregory a festival of joy embrace this [feast], let him revere it ; in it he may\nweigh out in full the declaration of his praise, none of the gloom in the other [feast] intruding\u2019 :\nCorpus 371, p. 181 ; Wilmart, pp. 211\u201312.\n175 Corpus 371, pp. 183\u20135; Wilmart, pp. 213\u201315.\n176 Corpus 371, p. 189; Wilmart, p. 219.\n177 Corpus 371, pp. 181\u20132; Wilmart, pp. 211\u201313.\n178 Corpus 371, pp. 177\u20138; Wilmart, pp. 208\u20139, seemingly after John the Deacon, Vita\nGregorii magni i. 21\u20132, p. 141.

Gregory had taught that at the last judgement the\npeoples of the world would be presented to God and defended by their\nrespective apostles :\nPonamus ante oculos nostros illum tantae districtionis diem quo iudex ueniet, et\nrationem cum seruis quibus talenta credidit ponet.

It is Gregory who will lead the English on that great day of\njudgement, \u2018 for if everyone will be the leader of those whom they converted\nto Christ, it is established that the blessed Gregory, who converted [the\nEnglish] to Christ, will be their leader on that day\u2019.184 It behoves the English,\nthen, that they adhere to the path their ductor has set out for them. If they\nglorify Gregory in Christ\u2019s presence by doing good works that demonstrate\nthe merit of his converts, then they will feel in their every prayer the\nintercessions of the most effective patron that they have in heaven.185\nIt is most improbable that such arguments were devised to deal with\nNorman hostility to the new feast. The homilist usually speaks of the debt\nwhich the English natio or gens owes to Gregory, but given that he occasionally\nspeaks of that owed by the \u2018English Church above all others \u2019,186 one might\nstill contrive to argue that it was merely a matter of explaining to Norman\nchurchmen why they had to tolerate Gregory\u2019s cult now that they had taken\nover the ecclesia anglicana. But one should recall how much evidence there is\nthat Norman monasteries were willing to accommodate the feast. The\nvarious Norman monasteries that adopted the reform cannot have done so\nunder duress. They were beyond Canterbury\u2019s jurisdiction, and if there had\nbeen a general policy of enforcing the feast in Normandy one would expect to\nfind that it had been adopted at Bec. There is simply no basis for the view\nthat the hostility to this particular cult was coming from the invaders\u2019 side.\nIndeed, several of the homilist\u2019s arguments are founded on the premise that\nthe feast\u2019s detractors have more enthusiasm for English saints than they have\nfor Gregory, a point which could not have applied to many Norman listeners.\nHe argues, for instance, that the English should have for Gregory the same\ndevotion that they have for the saints who have arisen among their own\npeople, for they would have had nothing of or from these persons if they had\nnot been brought out darkness by him:\nSi aliquem de sua gente creatum pro sanctitatis eius merito cum deo gloriari\nperpetuo credunt, et diligendo eum de eius \u00e6terna l\u00e6titia gaudent, utique non\ntantum su\u00e6 dilectionis et gaudii bonum quod se pro sancti illius felicitate l\u00e6tantur\n184 \u2018Si enim omnes erunt ductores illorum quos ad christum conuerterunt, constat quod\nbeatus Gregorius, qui eos ad Christum conuertit, in illa die eorum ductor erit \u2019 : Corpus 371,\np. 182; Wilmart, p. 212.\n185 \u2018Satagite potius ut quem in terra degentem, nullo uestro merito pr\u00e6cedente\nbenignissimum circa salutem uestram persensistis, nunc cum christo regnantem de bono\nstudio uestro coram eo gloriari faciatis, ac sic bonis meritis uestris adiuuantibus, in omni\noratione uestra efficacissimum patronum apud eum sentiatis \u2019 : Corpus 371, p. 182; Wilmart, p.\n213.\n186 \u2018Tacita igitur interim ueneratione quam tota \u00e6cclesia dei beato Gregorio merito debet,\npaucis cum uestra caritate considerare iuuat, quid ei pr\u00e6 ceteris omnibus Anglorum \u00e6cclesia\ndebeat \u2019 : Corpus 371, p. 178; Wilmart, p. 209.\n52 PAUL HAYWARD\nhabere, sed et gaudium ipsius sancti quod est adeptus, si recto sapiunt, beato\nGregorio ascribere debent.187\nEven the feasts of their saints proceed from that of Gregory\u2019s ordination, for\nthey would not have such celebrations if he had not been ordained, since\nbecoming pope allowed him to proceed with his plans for their conversion:\nLiquet ergo plurima eos per annum in diuersis domini et sanctorum eius\nfestiuitatibus gaudia solere habere, qu\u00e6 nimirum omnia si recte considerentur ex\nhodierna eis festiuitate processere. Ex ista [festiuitate] nanque processit ut ad fidem\nChristi uenirent, sine qua omnis boni gaudii expertes extiterant.188\nThis sermon is best interpreted as an attack upon some section of the local\npopulation that was largely English in identity and that could be accused of\ndenying Gregory his due. We should allow for the likelihood that the homilist\nis misrepresenting their faults, but it seems almost certain that this group had\nbestowed on some saint subordinate to Gregory in the kingdom\u2019s sacred\nhistory a dignity that was his as an apostle. The content and provenance of\nthis sermon suggests, moreover, that the archbishops had adopted the reform\nof the ordination feast as a way of challenging this group, and that they were\npromoting the cult in general as a means of implicating them before a wider\naudience, Norman and English, in the sin of showing disrespect for its\napostle. That the homilist wanted to publicise his position is clear : he\nexpresses the hope that his words will be repeated on suitable occasions for\nthe instruction of both \u2018English and others \u2019.189 It is not hard to identify these\nunnamed Englishmen who were denigrating Gregory by showing favour for\ntheir own saints. The homilist\u2019s preoccupation with episcopal authority\nprovides a further clue. The sermon concludes with an extended discussion of\nthe significance of ordination feasts which comes close to making the\ncelebration of these days a test of a believer\u2019s respect for the episcopal\nstructure of Christ\u2019s Church. These feasts recall, the homilist argues, the\nmiracle of a good man who is willing to accept the burden of episcopal office,\n187 \u2018For if they believe that some being of their own nation was glorified with God for\neternity because his holiness merited it and if they rejoice in his everlasting joy out of love for\nhim, they ought, not only to have the benefit of love and delight in which they rejoice on\naccount of this saint\u2019s happiness, but also, if they understand aright, to attribute to the blessed\nGregory the joy that the saint attained\u2019 : Corpus 371, p. 179; Wilmart, 210.\n188 \u2018 It is clear, therefore, that they are accustomed to have much rejoicing through the year\nin various feasts of the Lord and his saints, which clearly have all come down to them, if\nconsidered rightly, from today\u2019s festivity. For it proceeded from this [festivity] that they might\ncome to Christ\u2019s faith, without which they would stand bereft of the benefit of all celebration\u2019 :\nCorpus 371, p. 180; Wilmart, p. 211.\n189 \u2018His quoque adhuc pauca de pr\u00e6senti solennitate addere in cor uenit, quatinus simili\nmodo si causa extiterit, in Anglis et alii aduertant, quid de suis pr\u00e6dicatoribus non indebite\nfacere debeant \u2019 : Corpus 371, p. 180; Wilmart, p. 211.\nGREGORY THE GREAT AS \u2018APOSTLE OF THE ENGL I SH \u2019 53\nthey remind us of the great burdens and responsibilities bishops bear in\nleading the Church, they celebrate the redemption that comes through good\nleadership and the rewards that the good bishop receives in heaven.190\nOne possibility is easily dismissed. There is some evidence that the Old\nMinster, Winchester, may have been promoting Birinus as anglorum apostolus\nfrom about 1100, when they produced a Life of this saint.191 Two twelfth-\ncentury copies, neither from Winchester \u2013 BL, MS Cotton Caligula A.viii, fos\n121r\u20134v, and Hereford Cathedral Library, P.vii. 6, fos 134v\u20139r \u2013 use the\nepithet in their rubrics.192 But if this amounts to anything it is unlikely to\nrepresent more than a bid for a minor share of this honour, since there was\nno disguising the fact that Birinus\u2019 mission to the west Saxons had taken place\nthree decades after that organised by Gregory the Great.193 This leaves one\nstrong possibility : St Augustine\u2019s, Canterbury. The abbey fits the profile on\nmost counts : as has been seen already, St Augustine\u2019s was involved in a fierce\nstruggle with its diocesan who was none other than the archbishop of\nCanterbury ; it seems to have remained a refuge for English religious in spite\nof the appointment of a Norman abbot in 1070; and its saints\u2019 Lives and\ndiplomas deny Gregory the honour of being the English apostle on almost\nevery leaf.194 There can be little doubt that the archbishopric\u2019s promotion of\nGregory\u2019s cult was directed primarily against the efforts of the abbey to\npresent Augustine as the anglorum apostolus.\nHow, then, is the archbishopric\u2019s promotion of Gregory\u2019s cult to be\nunderstood in relation to the development of the cult of saints in England\nafter the Norman Conquest? It seems that Lanfranc\u2019s treatment of the cult is\nan important example, not of a Norman prelate warming to the English and\ntheir religious traditions, but of the search for better tactics. In the aftermath\nof the Conquest, many of the colonists had had considerable difficulty in\ncoming to terms with the saints\u2019 cults of the English Church largely, this\nauthor has argued elsewhere,195 because many of them were being used by\nEnglishmen holding office in the Church to secure their survival. It proved\ndifficult to legitimise their occupation of the English Church, to find pretexts\nfor getting rid of these abbots and bishops, while cures were continuing to\ntake place at the shrines in their care, miracles being evidence of divine\napproval for the custodians as well as a sign that their direct beneficiaries had\nhad their sins forgiven. Some of the new elite, not least Lanfranc himself,196\n190 Corpus 371, pp. 185\u20139; Wilmart, pp. 215\u201318.\n191 Vita beatissimi Byrini episcopi anglorum apostoli (BHL 1361), ed. R. C.

While the\nlocal population and custodian community continued to believe in the power\nof the saint, those who dared to question his or her claims to sanctity risked\nhaving their misfortunes interpreted as signs of divine disapproval. Given\nthese difficulties, many of the colonists resisted the doubts that these cults\nraised about the righteousness of the Conquest by retreating into racial\nprejudice, dismissing English saints with derogatory comments.197 Lanfranc\u2019s\npromotion of Gregory\u2019s cult typifies a third and far more cunning approach:\nthat of appropriating their symbolism and of turning it against potential rivals\nand centres of resistance.198\nLanfranc and Anselm certainly chose strong ground on which to challenge\nthe abbey: Gregory had been seen as the English apostle for much longer\nand far more widely than had Augustine. But, in the event, their defence of\nGregory\u2019s claim to the apostolic title proved futile. In the ensuing struggle \u2013 a\nstruggle upon which depended the primacy of the archbishop over the\nEnglish Church as a whole and that of St Augustine\u2019s over its monasteries \u2013\nthe abbey prevailed. To be sure, its surviving liturgical books show that the\nmonks adopted the new date for the feast of Gregory\u2019s ordination. Indeed,\nthe St Augustine\u2019s missal, produced around 1100, includes three collects\nfor the feast, though not in their proper place in the sanctorale cycle which\nmay indicate that the decision to adopt the feast was taken as the book was\nbeing produced. They are to be found entered in the main hand between the\nmass In natali unius confessoris et pontifice and the mass De uno confessore qui pontifex\nnon fuerit.199 The principal scribe of the abbey\u2019s martyrology enters the feast\nunder 3 September.200 By the early thirteenth century, St Augustine\u2019s was\neven observing its octave.201 But these were minor concessions. By the 1120s\n197 For the reality of that racism see R. Bartlett, The making of Europe : conquest, colonization and\ncultural change, 950\u20131350, Harmondsworth 1993, 272\u20133.\n198 Cf. P. A.

M. Rule,\nCambridge 1896, 130). The insertion of this mass set well out of sequence evidently caused\nsome confusion, for at its correct place in the sanctorale cycle (fo. 116r) the near-contemporary\nhand that makes most of the many annotations has inserted a marginal note directing the\nbook\u2019s users to employ for Gregory\u2019s ordinatio the service prescribed for St Martin\u2019s ordinatio (4\nJuly) :Missal of St Augustine\u2019s, 108. As for the dating of the manuscript, the text includes a mass in\nhonour of the translations of 1091 (p. 110), and there is among the additions a mass for a king\nand queen (pp. 158\u20139), which may have been required by the marriage of Henry I to Matilda\nin 1100. William II never married. This may indicate that the book was produced between 1091\nand 1100, but then, as we have seen, the intelligence of the annotations and additions is\nsometimes open to doubt.

If they use the epithet apostolus anglorum,\nliturgical materials from the 1120s and later decades apply it to Augustine\nalone.203 This is true, for instance, of all the calendars edited by Wormald,204\nincluding items from Christ Church Cathedral and those in the Sarum\ntradition.205 One hesitates to make a definitive statement since so much\nliturgical evidence remains to be checked, but Gregory seems to have been\ndropped as England\u2019s apostle almost everywhere, though his cult was still\naccorded great respect at most abbeys and monastic cathedrals. Deeply im-\npressed by Goscelin and his argument, William of Malmesbury nowhere de-\nscribes Gregory as the nation\u2019s apostle, denoting Augustine \u2018precellentissimus\nanglorum apostolus \u2019.206 The archbishopric succumbed from the 1120s. Its\nofficers and advocates continued to reserve the title for Gregory the Great\nuntil around this time, the major exceptions being where they were compelled\nto quote papal correspondence in which Augustine was described as the\n3 September feast is assigned to the relatively modest \u2018 seventh rank\u2019 in the grading system set\nout at i. 430\u20133.\n202 Evidence for the feast of Augustine\u2019s ordination first appears in manuscripts of about\n1120. The feast is noted in the abbey\u2019s martyrology (BL, MS Cotton Vitellius C.xii, fo. 149v) and\nreading material for the day appears in the principal manuscript of Goscelin\u2019s saints\u2019 lives\nfor the abbey (MS Cotton Vespasian B.xx, fo. 251v\u20139v) and as prefixed to the\nNovember\u2013December volume of a passional from the abbey (Bodl. Lib., MS Fell 2, pp.\n45\u201356). The latter book was produced in about 1130, but the text for Augustine\u2019s ordination is\na later addition to the whole. Fell 2 is, unfortunately, a much mutilated manuscript and the\ntext ends imperfectly. In both manuscripts, it appears under the rubric Relatio de ordinatione\nsancti augustini et de ipsius questionibus ad beatum papam Gregorium. The work\u2019s contents are largely\nderived from Bede, Historia ecclesiastica i. 26\u20137, pp. 78\u2013102, and ii. 3, pp. 142\u20134, with an\n\u2018original \u2019 section of some 100 words linking the two parts. By the middle of the twelfth century\nthe cathedral priory had responded to the creation of this ordinatio by instituting a feast of St\n\u00c6lfheah\u2019s ordination also to be celebrated on 16 November. This feast is attested in the\nCanterbury Martyrology of about 1150 (BL, MS Royal 7.E.vi, fo. 65r) and in the Calendar of\nthe Eadwine psalter of about 1150 (Pfaff, \u2018The calendar \u2019, 74). See also Kalendars after 1100, i. 78.\n203 For example,Missale ad usum ecclesie westmonasteriensis, ed. J.

Eadmer, for example, quotes a letter of Pope Alexander II\n(1061\u201373) on the issue of monastic chapters in which Augustine is described as\nsuch.207 After 1120, however, references to Augustine as anglorum apostolus\ncreep in unchecked.208 Even Archbishop Ralph\u2019s letter in defence of the\nprimacy designates him as such.209 From the 1120s until the present\nAugustine has remained England\u2019s apostle. His hold on the title continues\nto be affirmed by such standard reference works as the New Catholic\nencyclopaedia and the Oxford dictionary of the Christian Church.210 The abbey\u2019s\nsuccess has meant, moreover, that the archbishopric\u2019s campaign has left far\nless trace in the historical record. Yet it is a no less remarkable project not\nleast because it led an Italian prelate devoted to the Norman cause to\nresurrect a tradition once central to English identity.\n207 \u2018 et venit ad manus statutum pr\u00e6decessoris nostri beat\u00e6 memori\u00e6 Gregorii majoris de\necclesiis Angli\u00e6, quomodo scilicet pr\u00e6cepit Augustino gentis vestr\u00e6 apostolo ut \u2019 : Historia\nnovorum, p. 20; cf. ep. 452 in Anselm\u2019s correspondence (Anselmi opera v. 400), in which Pope\nPaschal II speaks of beholding in Anselm himself the \u2018persona of the blessed Augustine himself,\napostle of the English \u2019.

Note also that an\ninsertion by the main scribe, s.a. 614, in the F-text of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (produced at\nChrist Church, Canterbury, after 1100 and probably before 1125) describes Augustine as\n\u2018apostolus Anglorum\u2019: The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle : MS F, ed.
