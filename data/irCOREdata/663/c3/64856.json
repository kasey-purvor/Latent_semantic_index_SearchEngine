Res., 42, W01402, doi:10.1029\/2005WR004025.\n1. Introduction\n[2] Bed load transport can be highly variable [Einstein,\n1937; Gomez et al., 1989]. This circumstance presents\nimportant problems for the calibration and use of bed load\nsamplers [Emmett, 1980; Hubbell, 1987]. Bed load mea-\nsurement remains a major obstacle to understanding sedi-\nment transport in gravel bed rivers.\n[3] The most widely deployed bed load samplers are the\nbasket types, in which the moving sediment enters a nozzle\nand is trapped in a bag or basket [Hubbell, 1964]. The more\nadvanced designs maintain ambient fluid pressures in the\nentrance (e.g., the VU\u00b4V sampler of Novak [1957]). Helley\nand Smith [1971] designed one such sampler for use in\nnatural streams carrying fine gravels that has been widely\nadopted. First tests in a flume transporting sand showed that\nthe sampler might consistently overregister by about 50%.\nHelley and Smith observed that, when the sampler was\nraised from the bed, it tended to scoop additional material,\nand emphasized that the performance of the sampler would\ndepend on the bed material size. Johnson et al. [1977]\nreported clogging of the sampler\u2019s bag as another source of\nbias for the Helley-Smith (hereafter HS) design. In the East\nFork River, Wyoming, Emmett [1980] completed the first\nfield calibration of the original device. He reported for the\n76-mm intake HS sampler an efficiency of 1 (i.e., the real\nbed load rate tends to be the same as that collected with the\nsampler) for particles between 0.5 and 16 mm, approxi-\nmately the range of sizes for which the sampler was\ndesigned. Hubbell [1987] determined in a laboratory flume\nthat the device\u2019s efficiency decreases as grain size and bed\nload rates increase. Changes in the efficiency of modified\nHS samplers have also been reported. For instance, Gaudet\net al. [1994],on the basis of flume experiments with sand,\nreported that a standard sampler systematically trapped\nmore material than one with 30 mm opening, while Ryan\nand Porth [1999] found, on the basis of measurements in\ntwo cobble bed streams, that slight modifications of three\nHS samplers of 76-mm intake generated substantially dif-\nferent collections of bed load.\n[4] Various attempts have beenmade to asses the efficiency\nof this sampler in gravel bed rivers. In the Drau River of\nCopyright 2006 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0043-1397\/06\/2005WR004025$09.00\nW01402\nWATER RESOURCES RESEARCH, VOL. 42, W01402, doi:10.1029\/2005WR004025, 2006\n1 of 13\nAustria, a coarse gravel channel (D50-s = 65 mm), Habersack\net al. [2001] reported for a 152-mm intake HS sampler an\nefficiency close to unity by comparing the device\u2019s bed load\ncatch with that of a continuous recording slot sampler.\nHowever, in Harris Creek (median surface material between\n45 mm and 75 mm), British Columbia, Sterling and Church\n[2002], by comparing magnitude and grain size distributions\nof sediment samples collected by a pit trap and by a standard\nHS sampler (76-mm intake), reported a clear bias of the bed\nload samples collected with the HS device including substan-\ntial overregistration of sand sizes. They attributed the over-\ncatch to the propensity for the sampler to capture low-flying\nsuspended material (a deliberate design feature to comple-\nment standard DH series suspended sediment samplers).\nBunte et al. [2004] tested bed load transport measurements\nin two gravel and cobble bedded rivers and concluded that HS\nmeasurements were biased as bed load ratings constructed\nusing observations obtained with larger intakes and non-\nrecording bed load traps were better defined and steeper than\nthose obtained with a standard HS sampler (76-mm intake).\nEven so, and as a consequence of the lack of choices, this\nsampler has often been deployed in coarse gravel bed rivers\n[e.g., Andrews, 1994], and even on cobble beds [e.g., Ryan\nand Porth, 1999], without attempt to reassess the sampler\u2019s\nefficiency or accuracy. In particular, no assessment has been\nmade of the relation between sampler intake dimension, river\nbed material size, and the probability that the samples will be\nbiased.\n[5] These concerns motivated our efforts to understand\nhow the size of the HS sampler\u2019s nozzle might affect the\naccuracy of the sampling and the precision of bed load\nmeasurements and summary loads. We first present some\nsemitheoretical considerations based on the relative size of\nthe sampler intake and the resident bed material, and then\nproceed to field evaluation of the equivalence of the\nsediment trapped by two HS samplers respectively with\n76- and 152-mm intake. We subsequently compare the bed\nload yields predicted by the load-rating curves elaborated by\nthe two devices.\n2. Methods\n2.1. Study Site\n[6] Bed load was sampled in the lower Ebro River (NE\nIberian Peninsula) at Mo\u00b4ra d\u2019Ebre Monitoring Section\n(MEMS) (see Vericat and Batalla [2005] for details). Mean\nannual discharge is 430 m3 s\u00021 at Tortosa, 49 km down-\nstream from MEMS, where maximum peak flow was\nestimated by Novoa [1984] to be around 12,000 m3 s\u00021 in\n1907. Today, close to 190 reservoirs impound almost 60%\nof the catchment\u2019s annual runoff, most of them constructed\nbetween 1950 and 1975, reducing magnitude and frequency\nof floods in the lowermost reaches of the basin [Batalla et\nal., 2006]. The maximum discharge recorded at Tortosa in\nthe postdams period has been 3300 m3 s\u00021 in 1982. The\nmedian slope at the sampling section is 8.5 \u0003 10\u00024 [Vericat\nand Batalla, 2006]. Bed material was characterized before\nthe bed load samples were taken. Riverbed sampling was\nconduced at low-flow stages to assure access to active bed\nmaterial exposed in bars. Surface and subsurface materials\nFigure 1. Ebro River bed surface and subsurface grain size distributions at Mo\u00b4ra d\u2019Ebre B bar, bulk\ngrain size distribution in the East Fork River [Emmett, 1980], and grain size distributions for bed surface\n(obtained in riffles) and subsurface material in Harris Creek [Sterling and Church, 2002].\n2 of 13\nW01402 VERICAT ET AL.: BED LOAD BIAS USING HELLEY-SMITH SAMPLERS W01402\nwere sampled at the two exposed bars closest to MEMS.\nMo\u00b4ra d\u2019Ebre A bar is located about 1 km upstream, while\nMo\u00b4ra d\u2019Ebre B is just 100 m downstream. Surface and\nsubsurface size distributions show only small differences\nbetween the bars (less than 5%); therefore the closest bar\n(Mo\u00b4ra d\u2019Ebre B) has been chosen to characterize the river\nbed material at MEMS. The median surface material size\n(D50-s) is 39 mm (Figure 1) and maximum surface particle\n(D95-s) 86 mm. However, subsurface bed material median\nsize (D50-ss) is 21 mm while D95-ss is 62 mm (Figure 1). The\narmor ratio (Ar), measured as the ratio of median surface to\nmedian subsurface bed material size, is 1.9.\n2.2. Sampling Program\n[7] Bed load transport was sampled from a bridge at a\nsingle vertical (see Vericat and Batalla [2006] for details)\nduring 2003\u20132004 using a 29-kg cable suspended HS\nsampler with 76-mm intake (HS76), and a 76-kg cable\nsuspended HS sampler with 152-mm intake (HS152). Both\nsamplers were operated using an automatic crane with a\nconstant velocity engine. Fifty-four bed load samples were\nobtained with the HS76, while 47 were taken with the\nHS152. Twenty-three of these samples were paired; that is,\nthey were obtained with only a few minutes difference in\ntime (the recovery and deployment time for the samplers).\nThe sampling time for both devices was 5 minutes. Water\ndepth at the place where bed load was sampled ranged\nfrom 3 to 5 meters, while mean velocity varied from 1.5 to\n2 m s\u00021. The samples were taken to the laboratory where\nthey were dried, sieved and weighed. The samples were\ntruncated at 1 mm (excluding in any case no more than 5%\nof the total sample weight) before obtaining the total mass\nand grain size distribution in order to avoid including\nparticles that could be transported in suspension. Samples\nranged from a few grams to around 10 kg. Discharge during\nsampling ranged from 500 to 1,350 m3 s\u00021, that is, specific\ndischarges at the vertical ranged from 4.5 to 10.6 m2 s\u00021.\n2.3. General Comparison Between the HS Samplers\n[8] Power law load-rating relations [Barry et al., 2004] be-\ntween specific discharge at the sampling vertical (q in m2 s\u00021)\nand bed load transport rates (ib in g m\n\u00021s\u00021) differentiated\nby sampler have been constructed for the samples collected.\nFigure 2a shows that the upper envelope (defined by\nhighest rates) for each device is practically the same. The\nparticular trend line shown in Figure 2a for the upper\nenvelope is discussed later in the paper (see section 4.1).\nHowever, for a given specific discharge the bed load rate\ncollected by each device can differ by more than an order of\nmagnitude (in some cases, 2 orders). This difference could\nbe attributed to bias between samplers or to different\nconditions when the samples were taken (i.e., samples were\nnot, in general, obtained at the same time, so that river bed\nfeatures and transport could be different at each sampling).\nFurthermore, it is evident that each sampler can return an\nequally wide range of catches at essentially the same flow.\n[9] Temporal variations in bed load transport under near-\nsteady conditions have been reported by various observers\n[e.g., Hamamori, 1962; Reid and Frostick, 1986; Gomez et\nal., 1989; Kuhnle, 1992] and also could influence the\ncomparison of samples. Figure 3 shows that in different\nrivers, bed load transport presents high temporal variability\nwhich has been attributed to the stochastic behavior of the\nsediment transport. Nevertheless, the lowest bed load trans-\nport rates for the range in specific stream power (w) are\nthose collected with an HS76, and are probably influenced\nby a not strictly appropriate selection of the sampler\naccording to riverbed material. The data from Goodwin\nCreek [Kuhnle, 1992] were obtained with a modified HS76\ndeployed on an artificial surface for which, due the sam-\npling procedure, sampler efficiency was 100%. Under such\nconditions, the high variability of bed load rates under\nsimilar specific power would be attributed to the natural\nbehavior of the bed load transport rates rather than to bias\nduring the sampling. Various laboratory experiments cor-\nroborate the high bed load variability [e.g., Kuhnle and\nSouthard, 1988]. The balance of the data in Figure 3 show\nthat the MEMS data are typical of bed load transport\nobservation in gravel bed channels and exhibit similar\nvariability. There is no immediately obvious reason to\nconclude that MEMS data are biased.\n[10] A mean load-rating curve for the data of each\nsampler was defined by averaging the samples in 1 m2 s\u00021\nwide bins from 4 to 11 m2 s\u00021 (Figure 2b) in order to\nreduce the temporal variability of the bed load transport\ncited above, hence to define the mean apparent bed load\ntransport rate (ib-m in g m\n\u00021s\u00021) given specific flow (i.e., q)\nfor each device [e.g., Kuhnle, 1992]. Figure 2b reveals an\napparent bias between the two samplers. The scatter of the\nmean rates is also higher for the HS76 than for the HS152\nand, as a consequence, the correlation of the averaged data\nwith specific discharge is greater for the HS152 (r2 = 0.95)\nthan for the HS76 (r2 = 0.85).\n3. Sources of Bias\n3.1. Sampler Efficiency\n[11] The relation between bed material size and the\nsampler intake width (Figure 4a) must be an important\ndeterminant of sampler efficiency which may not be con-\nstant for all sediment sizes (Figure 4a). According to\nEmmett [1980], the efficiency of the HS76 is close to unity\nfor particle sizes between 0.5 and 16 mm, but decreases\nwhen the particles transported are larger than 16 mm. The\nintake width of his sampler (WHS76) was 76 mm. The ratio\nbetween the b axis of the largest clast size for which the\nefficiency was considered by Emmett [1980] to be close to\n100% and the sampler\u2019s intake width is 0.21. Emmett also\nreported that the efficiency decreased to 70% for particles\nbetween 16 and 32 mm (Di\/WHS76 = 0.42 when Di =\n32 mm). Trap efficiency obviously goes to zero when the\nparticle size is the same as the sampler\u2019s intake. According\nto the movement of particles during their transport, the a\naxis of the particles may actually be the critical axis to be\ncompared with the sampler\u2019s width, especially in rivers with\nhighly nonequant particles (which is not the case in the\nEbro: see Figure 4). Nevertheless, a axis values are not\noften available. This first observation from Emmett\u2019s [1980]\ncalibration gives some indication, then, of the propensity of\nthe moving grain Di to fit into the sampler opening, which\nwill become a more severely limiting factor as Di ! W.\n[12] Sterling and Church [2002], by comparing magni-\ntude and grain size distributions of sediment samples\ncollected by a pit trap and a standard HS sampler (76-mm\nintake), reported efficiencies higher than 1 for particles\nW01402 VERICAT ET AL.: BED LOAD BIAS USING HELLEY-SMITH SAMPLERS\n3 of 13\nW01402\nFigure 2.

They estimated a median\nefficiency of 0 for particles larger than 8 mm, while the pit\ntrap collected particles up to 45.3 mm. Compared with\nEmmett\u2019s [1980] calibration, in spite of using the same HS\nsampler, there is a large difference in the sampler\u2019s apparent\ngrain size-dependent efficiency. In the study by Sterling and\nChurch the trapping efficiency declined for all sizes larger\nthan coarse sand and approached zero when the b axis\nexceeded 10% of the sampler\u2019s width, while in Emmett\u2019s\n[1980] study the efficiency decreased when the particle size\nexceeded 20% of the sampler\u2019s width, or some modestly\nlarger proportion.\n[13] Comparing bed material grain size distributions from\neach study section (Figure 1) we can see that the relation\nbetween the characteristic bed material size and the sampler\nintake is greatly different. The largest particles in East Fork\nRiver [Emmett, 1980] attain 64 mm, while the median\nsurface material in Harris Creek [Sterling and Church,\n2002] is 75 mm. Thus, in Harris Creek half of the surface\nmaterial exceeds in size the sampler\u2019s width while, in East\nFork River, bed particles do not attain a size equivalent to\nthe sampler\u2019s width. Two principal sources of interference\nwith the collection of bed load using the HS sampler can be\ninvoked to explain the differences between the outcomes:\n\u2018\u2018blockage\u2019\u2019 of the sampler\u2019s intake (Figure 4b), and \u2018\u2018perch-\ning\u2019\u2019 of the sampler\u2019s intake (Figure 4c). In addition, Gaudet\net al. [1994] showed that off-line sampler alignment relative\nto the flow substantially reduced sampler catch.\n3.2. Sources of Interference\n[14] When the sampler is positioned immediately down-\nstream from a coarse clast (Figure 4b), the flow may be\ncompetent to move the clast, or it may not be competent so\nthat the clast remains to block the entrance of the sampler.\nIn the first case, as we have explained above, the propensity\nfor that clast to pass through the intake will be related to the\nratio Di\/Ws. As shear stress increases larger clasts may be\nmobilized and, consequently, the bias should increase\nbecause of the increasing ratio Di\/Ws. However, when the\nflow strength is not high enough to move the clast, it will\nblock the entrance of the sampler, reducing the sampler\u2019s\noperative width and decreasing the probability to catch the\nmoving sizes. The minimum distance between the sampler\nand an immobile Di for interference by blocking will be\nFigure 3. Relation between specific stream power (w) and bed load transport rate (ib) for different\nfluvial environments; Ebro River data emphasized. The data are not normalized.\nW01402 VERICAT ET AL.: BED LOAD BIAS USING HELLEY-SMITH SAMPLERS\n5 of 13\nW01402\nrelated to the eddy structure of the flow around the blocking\nclast, hence the trajectory of the moving grains, their\nmechanism of transport, and the riverbed configuration\nand evolution during sampling. For any grain size Di, the\nratio Di\/Ws indicates the capacity of the grain to interfere\nwith bed load sampling by decreasing the sampler\u2019s effec-\ntive intake width and by diverting oncoming grains. Block-\nage of the Helley-Smith sampler has been demonstrated (but\nnot quantified) as a source of interference with bed load\nsampling by Duizendstra [2001a, 2001b], citing evidence\nfrom underwater video recordings.\n[15] Bed load size distributions obtained during the field\ncalibration in East Fork River [Emmett, 1980] show that the\nmaximum sizes transported were between 32 and 45.3 mm.\nConsequently, only a small proportion of the bed material\nremained immobile during Emmett\u2019s calibration. An immo-\nbile clast of 45.3 mm could decrease the sampler\u2019s effective\nopening width by about 60%, decreasing the propensity of\nthe moving particles to pass through the sampler opening.\nHowever, the small proportion of these sizes in the river bed\nmaterial yields only a small probability that the sampler\nmight be positioned immediately downstream from a coarse\nimmobile clast. On the other hand, in Harris Creek [Sterling\nand Church, 2002] all the material apparently transported\nwas much smaller than the median size of the bed surface\nmaterial. Maximum sizes in the bed load samples collected\nby the pit trap attained 45.3 mm, while the HS sampler\ncollected maximum sizes of 16 mm. Large, immobile\nparticles might decrease the sampler\u2019s effective opening\nwidth. Indeed, the bed surface grain size distribution\n(Figure 1) shows that the entire sampler opening might be\nblocked. The sampler\u2019s efficiency by grain size will be\ndecreased as the effective opening decreases, so that fine\nparticles traveling in saltation or suspension can still pass\nthrough the remaining nozzle opening, while many or all\nrolling clasts may be excluded.\n[16] The sampler also may not repose squarely on the\nbed, it may perch on a large clast (Figure 4c), in which case\nmoving sediment may pass beneath the sampler\u2019s mouth.\nDuizendstra [2001a, 2001b] observed that sampler tilting\ninterfered with bed load sampling. If the sampler settles\nonto a clast of diameter Di, smaller material is almost certain\nnot to be sampled if it moves by rolling, although saltating\ngrains may still be trapped. Indeed, one might easily assume\nthat it will require a clast with D > 2Di to achieve the\nnecessary elevation to surmount the step. This assumption\nmay not be strictly true because the sampler may be tilted\n(dashed configuration in Figure 4c) so that part of the\nsmaller material can be trapped while, on the other hand,\nclasts larger than 2Di may not be able to surmount the step\nthat is encountered. The particle c axis or some fraction of\nit, according to clast exposure, may be the critical measure\nin this instance. Our overall knowledge of the situation\nremains rudimentary at best.\n3.3. Probability of Interference\n[17] The bulk grain size distribution in East Fork River\n(no separate surface size distribution was given) and the\nsurface distribution in Harris Creek (Figure 1) were con-\nverted to line-by-number distributions following a conver-\nsion factor of 1\/D [after Kellerhals and Bray, 1971]. The\nline-by-number distribution represents the collection of all\nclasts falling under a straight line across a sampling plane\n[Muir, 1969; Kellerhals and Bray, 1971]. Thus the distri-\nbution can be interpreted as the probability for the sampler\nto encounter a clast of given size Di. The probability is the\nsame for the sampler to be positioned immediately down-\nstream from such a clast (source of blockage, Figure 4b), or\nfor the sampler to settle onto it (source of perching,\nFigure 4c). Therefore the integral of the probability density\nfunction (i.e., the cumulative density function) quantifies\nthe probability for the sampler to be blocked by a clast\nFigure 4. (a) River bed surface material at MEMS (Mo\u00b4ra\nd\u2019Ebre B) bar and scaled plan of the two Helley-Smith\nsamplers (76- and 152-mm intakes). Note the difference\nbetween the sampler nozzles (Ws) in relation to the bed\nmaterial. Possible sources of errors related to the bed\nmaterial size and the Helley-Smith samplers\u2019 nozzle size are\n(b) blockage of the HS nozzle when the sampler is located\nbehind a coarse particle (front view) and (c) sampler\nperched, i.e., not resting flush with the bed surface, due to\nthe bed roughness (front view). Note that the samplers can\nbe tilted by excentric support.\n6 of 13\nW01402 VERICAT ET AL.: BED LOAD BIAS USING HELLEY-SMITH SAMPLERS W01402\ncoarser than Di and the probability for a moving stone, Di,\nnot to be sampled because the sampler\u2019s nozzle is perched.\n[18] Figure 5a shows the cumulative density function at\nEast Fork River and at Harris Creek. In East Fork River the\nsampler intake has probability 0.5 (50%) to be blocked by\nclasts coarser than 0.5 mm, while sizes larger than 60 mm\nhave probability 0.5 to block the entrance of the sampler in\nHarris Creek, reducing the sampler\u2019s effective exposure in\nmuch greater degree than in East Fork River. Again, as we\nhave explained above, when the sampler is positioned\nimmediately downstream from a particular clast the flow\nmay or may not be competent to move it, so that the\ninterference with the bed load sample by blockage of the\nsampler will actually be determined jointly by the flow\ncompetence and the size of the particle that is positioned in\nfront of the sampler. The probability for the sampler to be\nblocked by a size coarser than the largest size trapped\nduring the field calibrations is around 0.1% in East Fork\n(Di = 45.3 mm) and 73% in Harris Creek (Di = 45.3 mm), a\ndifference that clearly helps to explain the variation in\nsampler performances between the two streams.\n[19] Figure 5a also quantifies the probability for a moving\nstone, Di, not to be sampled because of perching of the\nsampler\u2019s nozzle, tilt not being considered. The probability\nto be excluded should be higher for the small particles and\nshould decrease as their sizes increase. A moving size of\n1.0 mm has a probability to be excluded at East Fork River of\n0.5 (considering a doubling of sizes to overcome the perching\nelevation), while the efficiency of the HS sampler for this size\nreported by Emmett\u2019s [1980] calibration was 1.0. This sug-\ngests that the relative weight of the HS76 compared with the\ncompactability of the relatively fine river bed might allow a\nreadjustment of the sampler attitude so that the probability\nwill be less than that assessed in Figure 5a; indeed, perching\nmust become a negligible problem in sufficiently fine gravel\n(for which the sampler was originally designed). The much\ncoarser bed surface size distribution at Harris Creek is apt to\nbe much more refractory. A moving Di of 6.5 mm (again,\ndoubling Di to overcome the step) has a probability to be\nexcluded of 1. However, Sterling andChurch [2002] reported\nefficiencies close to 100% for particles as fine as 0.5mm. This\ndiscrepancy may be related to the configuration of the\nupstream approach that may steer the fine material into the\nsampler, and to fine particles traveling in saltation or suspen-\nsion, or may merely reflect the circumstance that the sampler\n(visually placed) was not normally perched.\n[20] These assessments show that coarse bedded rivers\npotentially more strongly interfere with sampler perfor-\nmance, and this can explain part of the difference between\nsampler efficiency calculated for the Harris Creek observa-\ntions [Sterling and Church, 2002] and for East Fork River\n[Emmett, 1980]. Figure 5b shows rescalings of Figure 5a for\nthe two sampler sizes discussed in this paper, and defines\nregions of limited efficiency [Emmett, 1980] (section 3.1)\nfor each sampler. However, the examples we have discussed\nalso reveal significant further complications in sampler\nperformance so that, in practice, it is not possible to\npartition the sources of impaired sampler efficiency dis-\ncussed above, nor to assign simple probabilities. Therefore\nwe turn to empirical results.\n4. Analysis of the Ebro Paired Samples\n4.1. Sampler Efficiency\n[21] Twenty-three pairs of bed load samples were\nobtained, each in immediate succession, on the same\nFigure 5.

The dashed\nline represents a probability of 0.5. (b) As Figure 5a but\nscaled for sampler intake width 76 mm on the lower\nabscissa, 152 mm on the upper abscissa.\nW01402 VERICAT ET AL.: BED LOAD BIAS USING HELLEY-SMITH SAMPLERS\n7 of 13\nW01402\nvertical at the MEMS station (Table 1). The samples plotted\nagainst the discharge show, again, that the upper envelopes\nfor each device are similar (Figure 6a). However, clear\ndifferences can be observed for samples collected at the\nsame time. We sometimes obtained similar bed load rates\nusing both devices, but large differences also occurred. For\ninstance, at 8.8 m2 s\u00021 the bed load rate sampled by the\nHS152 was 192 g m\u00021 s\u00021, while by the HS76 it was\n202 g m\u00021 s\u00021 Yet with a specific discharge of 10.4 m2 s\u00021,\nthe bed load rate for the HS152 was 339 g m\u00021 s\u00021 and\n47 g m\u00021 s\u00021 for the HS76 (Table 1). In general, the HS152\ncollected the larger samples (Figure 6b). A paired-sample,\none-tailed t test was applied to the log10-transformed data to\ndetermine whether the mean sample size differs significantly\nbetween samplers (in effect, whether the mean percentage\ndifference is other than zero). The difference between the\nbed load rates sampled by the HS152 and by the HS76 is\nstatistically significant (p = 0.0011).\n[22] Comparing bed load grain size distributions and bed\nsurface grain size distribution, it appears that river bed\nmaterial was only partially mobilized during the sampling.\nThe coarsest sample collected with either HS sampler falls at\nabout the 90th percentile of the river bed surface size\ndistribution. Further insight into sampler performance may\nbe gained by examining the largest material retained in each\nsample (Table 1). Maximum grain size increases with\nspecific discharge (Figure 7a). However, a more definitive\nrelation is observed between maximum grain size and\nsample mass (Figure 7b), suggesting that maximum ob-\nserved grain size may be an artifact of sample adequacy\n(the relatively rare large stones being least apt to be caught in\na representative fashion in a small sample). The presence of a\nlarge stone may in some cases be the reason for a high\nobserved transport rate. The HS152 sampler nearly always\ncatches larger stones than the HS76 device (Figure 7c).

For\nsamples collected with the HS152 Dmax-bl\/Ws ranged from\n0.2 to 0.5, and the maximum particle sampled never\nexceeded half of the sampler\u2019s intake width, possibly\nbecause such material was not moving. However, for the\nsamples obtained with the HS76 Dmax-bl\/Ws varied from 0.1\nto 0.9 and the largest sizes trapped by the HS152 might, in\nmany of the cases, have been excluded from the HS76\nintake. In contrast, the maximum size collected with the\nHS152 has probability about 0.4 to be excluded from the\nsampler in a simple situation (Figure 5). Consequently, it\nappears that samples collected with the HS76 are subject to\ngreater bias against large grain sizes than those obtained\nwith the HS152.\n[24] The observed differences between the paired samples\nmay in fact be related either to sampler bias or to temporal\nbed load variability. We did not replicate measurements in\nquick succession with the same sampler, so we cannot\nassess temporal variability directly. Let us suppose that\nthe underlying bed load transport relation is ib = aq\nc, which\nis the most frequently applied empirical model for the\nprocess [e.g., Whiting et al., 1999; Emmett and Wolman,\n2001; Barry et al., 2004], and that for an individual sampler,\nthe observed relation is ibW = aq\nc\u0005bW, where bW indicates a\nfractional efficiency or bias factor for a sampler with intake\nwidth W. Then an individual observation is represented,\nunder logarithmic transformation, by\nlog ibW \u00bc log a\u00fe c log q\u00fe log biW \u00fe log e \u00f01\u00de\nin which e indicates a random temporal fluctuation in\ntransport, distributed as N(0, se\n2). Since bW takes on a\nparticular value for each observation, log biW is also a random\nvariable with distribution N(log bW , sb). The linearized\nmodel is convenient because the log-transformed variates\nare more nearly normally distributed than the raw data.\n[25] We can study the relative bias of the two samplers by\ndefining RHS = ib76\/ib152. LogRHS = logbi76 \u0002 logbi152 +\nlogei76 \u0002 logei152 and, on the assumption that the bias of the\nobservation is uncorrelated with the temporal fluctuations in\ntransport, the distribution of logRHS is N(log b76 \u0002 log b152,\n2sb\n2 + 2se\n2). The distribution of logRHS can be assessed\ndirectly from the data (Table 1), and it is found that logRHS\n= \u00020.43 (implying that the transport observed with the\n76 mm sampler is, on average, only 40% of that observed in\nthe same flow with the 152 mm sampler). However, s =\n\u00b10.42, with contributions from both the bias factor and from\ntransport fluctuations, implying a substantial range in the\nrelative performance of the two samplers.\n[26] We can examine the absolute bias of the samplers only\nif we know the underlying transport relation, that is, only if we\nknow the true amount of material moving. We do not know\nthat. However, inspection reveals a relatively homogeneous\ngroup of data near the upper envelope of the scatter\n(Figure 6a). The measurements identified in Figure 6a and\nin Table 1 were selected to essay an approximation of the\nunderlying transport relation. They yield the result\nlogibW \u00bc \u00021:24\u00fe 3:57 log q \u00f02\u00de\nwith r2 = 0.81 and standard error of estimate 0.17 log units.\nThe back-transformed result is ib = 0.057q\n3.57, with standard\nFigure 7.

The selected data in fact\nscatter within a range between 0.5 and 2 times about the\nrelation, which is usual for sediment transport observations.\nThe exponent is reasonable for a gravel bed river with\npartial transport [Whiting et al., 1999; Emmett and Wolman,\n2001]. By comparing the transport samples with transport\npredicted from this equation we find the mean efficiency for\nthe HS152 to be 0.514 and, for the HS76, 0.192. The ratio\nof these two values is 0.37, which is not dissimilar to the\nrelative efficiency calculated directly from the measure-\nments. Similar results on the relative efficiency of the\nsamplers are arrived at by regression on all of the data,\nusing a dummy variable to discriminate the two samplers\n(R.I. Ferguson, personal communication, 2005). Hence the\nanalysis appears to be relatively robust.\n4.2. Comparison of Grain Size Distributions\n[27] Figure 6b identifies the paired samples for which\nthe fluxes fall within (group A) and without (group B) a\nfactor 2 of each other (group A is not the same as the\ndata selected to estimate equation (2), since pairs\nof samples that both appear to be biased may have similar\nsample size, hence fall within the group A defined here).\nSample groups are identified in Table 1. We compare the\ngrain size distributions of these samples, and of the balance\nof the samples, to see if further light can be thrown on\nsampler performance.\n[28] Considering that the HS152 has a higher probability\nto collect unbiased bed load samples or, at least, to collect a\nwider range of sizes without bias, RHS can be interpreted as\na relative efficiency for the HS76. Here median relative\nefficiency has been calculated by one phi grain size classes\nover all samples and is found not to diverge dramatically\nfrom 100% among group A samples (11 samples; Figure 8).\nIn fact, the relative efficiency of the HS76 appears to\nincrease at the coarser extreme of the size range, perhaps\nindicating the large weight proportion of the Dmax-bl in the\ntotal mass. Median efficiency by grain size for the samples\nin group B (12 samples) shows that the HS76 comparatively\nundercatches material in all the fractions (Figure 8). The\nmaximum efficiency is 0.24 for particles between 1 mm and\n2 mm, while the minimum efficiency is 0.10 for particles\nbetween 2 and 4 mm. In only three of the HS76 samples in\nthis group were there particles between 16 and 32 mm.\n[29] We have also compared characteristic percentiles\n(i.e., D5, D50 and D95) of the bed load grain size distribu-\ntions for each device. For this purpose we have divided the\nsamples of group A in two subgroups: (1) the five pairs of\ndata that went into computing equation (2) and (2) the\nremaining 6 samples whose relative size does not vary by\nmore than 2 times (Table 1). Samples in both subgroups\nhave practically equivalent grain size distributions. On this\nevidence, these samples may be characterized as genuinely\nunbiased. Of the samples in subgroup 2, 3 contributed the\nlarger observation to the computation of equation (2), but\nthe remaining 3 appear to have low catches. This may,\nhowever, simply represent transport variation. Bed load\ngrain size distributions for the samples in group B were\nalso compared. The characteristic percentiles differ between\nsamples. Differences range between 10% and 290%, the\nlargest differences being associated with the largest sizes\n(e.g., D95). The HS152 generally caught coarser sizes, thus\nit appears that catch discrepancies can be assigned largely to\nthe more severe limitation of the smaller sampler to catch\nthe largest material.\n4.3. Sources and Probability of Bias in the Ebro\nPaired Samples\n[30] According to Figure 5, the samplers at MEMS have\nprobability 0.5 to be blocked by a particle larger than\n32 mm, some of which were moving when the samplers\nwere operated. However, the coarsest 20% of the bed\nsurface material at MEMS, that is, sizes larger than\n64 mm, were not generally sampled and probably mostly\nnot entrained. Considering an immobile size Di = 64 mm,\nthe probability that the HS samplers may be placed just\nbelow a clast coarser than 64 mm is 0.2, a probability much\nhigher than that estimated for immobile particles in East\nFork River and lower than that in Harris Creek (Figure 5).\nOn the other hand, while the probability for each sampler to\nbe perched is the same, the greater width of the HS152 may\nincrease its propensity to be tilted so that it may catch more\nmaterial and yield less biased samples.\n[31] Change of the sampler\u2019s effective intake width\ninfluences the probability of a moving grain Di to fit into\nthe effective nozzle opening. Normally entrained sizes\ncould cover up to 40% of the HS152 opening width and\n80% of HS76 width. Assuming that the samplers were\nblocked by an immobile clast of Di = 64 mm, the opening\nwidth would remain sufficient to catch particles up to 88 mm\n(b axis) in the case of the HS152, but only sizes around\n12 mm with the HS76. Three HS76 samples in group B\nindeed have Dmax-bl close to 12 mm (Table 1) while, at the\nsame time, the HS152 collected sizes almost three times\nlarger, reflecting the possibility that the HS76 was highly\nblocked during sampling. The other samples in group B\nshow that Dmax-bl obtained with the HS76 is generally finer\n(in varying degree) than that for the HS152 (Table 1).\n[32] We may examine the empirical probability for bias in\nindividual samples by considering the frequency distribu-\ntion of departures from the estimated transport relation of\nequation (2), that is, the values logib-obs \u0002 logib-pred, which\ntransform from ib-obs\/ib-pred. Figure 9a shows the distribution\nFigure 8. Estimated relative efficiency by grain size for\nthe HS76 bed load samples calculated by dividing each\ncollection rate by size obtained with the HS76 by the rate by\nsize collected with the HS152.\n10 of 13\nW01402 VERICAT ET AL.: BED LOAD BIAS USING HELLEY-SMITH SAMPLERS W01402\nof the departures, binned in units of 2 standard errors about\nthe regression. It is apparent that, on this criterion, a large\nproportion of the samples from both samplers is negatively\nbiased. Furthermore, the distributions are relatively smooth,\nindicating that bias is indeed a random factor, as assumed\nabove. Altogether, 65% of the HS76 samples fall outside the\nexpected range of fluctuations (2 standard errors about the\nregression), while 43% of the HS152 observations are\napparently biased. The distribution of values for the\nHS152 is, however, tighter, with no value exceeding \u000210\nstandard error of estimate units whereas the largest negative\ndepartures for the HS76 are >16 and >12 units below the\nexpected values. In these cases, the estimated fluxes were\n0.1 and 0.3 g m\u00021 s\u00021, whereas the paired catch with the\nHS152 was about 10 g m\u00021 s\u00021 in each case (and classified\nas biased). These must surely represent cases of complete\nblockage of the HS76 sampler. One HS152 sample indicates\npositive bias. The value falls 2.44 standard error of estimate\nunits above the expected value and might be either a\nreal positive excursion or the consequence of scooping\nbed material. Similar behavior was found analyzing the\ndistribution of the departures for the unpaired samples\n(Figure 9b), except that somewhat larger negative depar-\ntures were also observed for the HS152 sampler. Altogether,\n50% of the HS152 samples in this group are negatively\nbiased, while 61% of the HS76 samples are biased.\n5. Bias in Annual Bed Load Yield for the Ebro\nSamples\n[33] The samples collected with each HS sampler were\nused to make various sediment load computations. For that\npurpose the relations in Figure 2b and the underlying\ntransport relation in equation (2) have been used. In\nFigure 2b the data for each device were group averaged\nto define a mean transport rate for each Helley-Smith\ndevice, all samples considered, while the relation in\nequation (2) is an attempt (not necessary successful) to\narrive at the unbiased underlying relation by data selection.\nAnnual loads were estimated according to the flow duration\ncurve method [Walling, 1984].\n[34] The sediment load estimated for the 2003\u20132004\nhydrological year changes by about 24% between the two\nmean load-rating curves, the load estimated from HS76\nmeasurements (61 \u0003 103 t) being lower than that for the\nHS152 (i.e., 81 \u0003 103 t). The annual load computed with\nequation (2) (i.e., 124 \u0003 103 t) is higher than the above\nreported loads, being 2 and 1.5 times higher than those for\nthe HS76 and HS152, respectively.\n[35] It is clear, as shown in Figure 3 and in flume\nexperiments [e.g., Kuhnle and Southard, 1988], that high\nvariability in bed load rates under a similar threshold would\nbe more likely attributed to the natural behavior of the bed\nload transport than to bias during the sampling; consequently,\nassessing the efficiency of samplers remains a difficult\nexercise. Selecting for use samplers with geometries that\ninterfere less with sampling, will reduce the problem of bias\nand increase the precision of annual loads estimated in\ngravel bed rivers. Moreover, an adequate sampler opening\nis strictly necessary, as shown by the results of the paired\nsampling, in order to assess accurately the grain size\ndistributions of bed load samples.\n6. Summary and Conclusions\n[36] Field calibrations of the standard HS sampler\n(76-mm) by Emmett [1980] and by Sterling and Church\n[2002] were compared. Two sources of interference with the\ncollection of bed load using the HS sampler, both related to\nthe relation between sampler intake dimension and river bed\nmaterial size, are invoked to explain the differences between\nthe calibrations. These are (1) blockage of the sampler\u2019s\nFigure 9. Sampler bias estimated by comparing the\ndeparture of (a) paired and (b) unpaired sample catches\nfrom the result predicted by equation (2). Bins are scaled by\n2 standard errors of estimate of equation (2). See text for\ndetails on the construction of the equation. Note that the\nclass designator represents the upper bound of the class.\nW01402 VERICAT ET AL.: BED LOAD BIAS USING HELLEY-SMITH SAMPLERS\n11 of 13\nW01402\nnozzle, related to the proportion of coarser immobile clasts\nin the bed, and (2) perching of the sampler\u2019s intake. The\nrelative weight of the HS compared with the river bed\nmaterial might influence the degree of interference posed by\nthe second effect.\n[37] Because of complexities in the possible juxtaposition\nof the samplers and clasts resident on the streambed, a\nquantitative model of probabilities for these biases remains\nelusive but these factors must be recognized as important\nwhen selecting methods to make measurements of bed load\ntransport in a particular stream.\n[38] The bed load samples obtained in the gravel bedded\nEbro River using two HS samplers of different size show\nclear bias of the smaller with respect to the larger. Twenty-\nthree of the bed load samples were paired, and their analysis\nleads to the following conclusions.\n[39] 1. The bed load rates of the paired samples and the\nlargest particles captured in these samples are statistically\nsignificantly different. The HS76 tends to catch less material\nand the largest sizes are smaller than those obtained with the\nHS152.\n[40] 2. Comparing samples and samplers\u2019 intakes we\nassessed the probability of interference with each sampler.\nThe probability for a bed load sample collected at MEMS\nwith the HS152 to be biased was 43%, whereas 65% of the\nHS76 samples were biased. However, these figures proba-\nbly depend on the flows that were sampled and certainly\ndepend upon the state of the bed.\n[41] 3. The results obtained with the larger sampler were\nless severely biased: on average, a sample caught with the\nHS76 was only 40% of the HS152 catch. Exclusion of the\nlargest mobile clasts may play an important part in this\ndifference.\n[42] 4. Samples taken with each sampler exhibited a\ncontinuous range of bias, confirming that the actual con-\nditions encountered at the bed are variable and making the\nactual bias a random effect.\n[43] Annual loads assessed with each sampler differ by\naround 25% using the mean load-rating curves for each\ndevice. Comparing these loads with the annual load com-\nputing by the estimated underlying load-rating curve the\ndifference is much larger, being twice that calculated using\nthe mean load-rating curve for the HS76.\n[44] Our results show that two contextual issues are\nnecessary to take in to account when a sampling program\nis defined. It is necessary to collect a significant number of\nsamples under steady conditions in order to define accurate\nmean bed load rates for different flow strengths, and to asses\nthe error around the load estimates due to the bed load\ntemporal variability [e.g., Gomez and Troutman, 1997].\nThat error is not fully isolated in this study. Furthermore,\nthe possibility for sampler bias and the sediment size related\nlimit of sampler efficiency mean that it may be difficult to\ndetermine flow competence and the size distribution of the\nload from sample catch. In this respect, it appears that the\nsampler intake opening should remain greater than 5 times\nthe diameter (conservatively of the a axis) of the largest\nstones apt to move in the stream.\n[45] Readers are finally reminded that the results in this\npaper can be interpreted only qualitatively since the refer-\nence transport rates derived from equation (2) are based on\nan arbitrary selection of samples that we judge to have been\n\u2018\u2018unbiased\u2019\u2019. That selection, in turn, has established a\nprobably narrow range of \u2018\u2018normal\u2019\u2019 temporal variation in\nload. Consequently, the components of variance in equation\n(1) may not be correctly divided. We have no doubt at all,\nhowever, that the results are indicative of important phe-\nnomena associated with sediment transport measurement\nthat have been too little studied and require substantial\nfurther attention.\nNotation\nAr armor ratio, equal to D50-s\/D50-ss\nd Water depth at vertical where the samples were\ncollected (m).\nD50-s Median surface grain size (mm).\nD50-ss Median subsurface grain size (mm).\nD95-s Percentile 95 of the surface grain size distribution\n(mm).\nD95-ss Percentile 95 of the subsurface grain size\ndistribution (mm).\nDi Particle size i (mm).\nDmax-bl Maximum bed load grain size (mm).\nib Bed load transport rate (g m\n\u00021 s\u00021 or kg m\u00021 s\u00021).\nib-m Mean bed load transport rate (g m\n\u00021 s\u00021).\nq Specific discharge (q = d\u0005v) at the vertical where\nthe samples were collected (m2 s\u00021).\nRHS ibHS76\/ibHS152.\nv Mean velocity at vertical where the samples were\ncollected (m s\u00021).\nWs Bed load sampler\u2019s nozzle width (mm).\nWHS152 Helley-Smith sampler\u2019s nozzle width of 152 mm.\nWHS76 Helley-Smith sampler\u2019s nozzle width of 76 mm.\nw Specific stream power (kg m\u00021s\u00021) [i.e., Bagnold,\n1980].\n[46] Acknowledgments.
