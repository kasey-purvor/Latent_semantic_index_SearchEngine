Introduction \nOne of the most critical challenges ahead for the Diesel passenger-car engine is to \nmeet future emissions regulations whilst improving performance and fuel economy with \na minimal cost penalty. The current and emerging after-treatment technologies give \nencouraging results, but their cost and complexity threaten the competitiveness of the \nDiesel engine package. Conversely, over the past decade, research in Diesel \nhomogeneous charge combustion has highlighted an alternative approach for significant \nengine out reductions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and Particulate Matter (PM) emissions \n[1-9]. Importantly, it demonstrates the capability of simultaneously reducing NOx and \nPM emissions, thus potentially offering an extended use of Diesel engines without, or \nwith greatly reduced, after-treatment requirements. There are two possible approaches \nto achieve this ultra-low emissions combustion, where both aim to obtain a lean and \nhighly mixed charge prior to combustion.  \nThe first is HCCI (Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition), relying on early \ninjections to achieve a chemically and physically homogeneous mixture before auto-\nignition. Homogeneous charge combustion is closer to the ideal constant-volume Otto \ncycle, as observed in Ref. [6]. There is no diffusion flame but a global near-\ninstantaneous combustion, offering the same ultra-low NOx and soot emissions \ncharacteristics as HCCI for the gasoline application. The locally lean nature of the \nmixture results in negligible soot emissions and ultra-low NOx emissions due to the low \nflame temperatures. Typically, two distinct stages are present in the combustion with \nHCCI operation, the first stage is associated with the initial rupture of the long carbon \nchains, often referred to as cool combustion or low temperature oxidation [10]. This \ninitiates the active radicals, which trigger the main combustion, also referred to as the \nhigh temperature oxidation. For high AFRs (Air-Fuel Ratios), the cool combustion \nresults in an increase in in-cylinder temperature until the main combustion is triggered \n(the second distinct peak of the heat release). EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) is used \n 3 \nto reduce the oxygen concentration and to control the rate of combustion by acting as a \nheat sink, especially for the higher loads where closer-to-stoichiometric mixtures are \npresent. \nThe second approach to ultra-low emissions is PCCI (Premixed Charge Compression \nIgnition), which relies on late injections and high EGR rates to delay the auto-ignition. \nCompared to HCCI, PCCI offers lower NOx and soot reductions, but it does not exhibit \nthe higher HC, CO, noise emissions, and the very tight requirements for homogeneity \nand leanness. PCCI is a single-stage combustion process closer to the premixed phase of \nconventional Diesel combustion, than the low and high temperature oxidations seen \nwith HCCI [11]. PCCI is an approach generally more adapted to Diesel-fuelled \napplications as it does not rely on early injection timings when the piston is low in the \ncylinder and is therefore less prone to wall wetting with the inevitable high increases in \nHC and CO emissions. Furthermore, the combustion is not fully decoupled from the \ninjection as in HCCI operation due to the late injections, allowing for greater control \nover the start of combustion. \nThe programme of work described here presents an exploration of the fundamentals \nof PCCI Diesel combustion to achieve low engine-out emissions, in particular the \nimpact of reduced compression ratio on NOx and soot emissions. \n2. Experimental Approach \n2.1. Apparatus \nIn order to allow as wide an exploration as possible, a single-cylinder Diesel research \nengine was used with a configuration based on that of a current production 2.0 litre, four \ncylinder automotive engine. Two engine builds were available: Build #1 was a single-\ncylinder version of the four cylinder engine, and was used to define a baseline derived \nfrom existing multi-cylinder engine test data; Build #2 was the configuration to be used \nthrough the advanced combustion investigations. Details are shown in Table 1. The test \ncell was developed to offer independent control of inlet-air pressure and temperature, \nexhaust backpressure, EGR temperature, and injection pressure, opening the envelope \nbeyond any hardware limiting characteristics such as those of an engine mounted high \npressure fuel pump or turbocharger. \nA flush-mounted in-cylinder pressure transducer was selected for its ability to \nprovide accurate high speed transient pressure data, suitable for heat release \ncalculations, which were considered as the key characteristics for the analysis of the \ncombustion. Both oil and coolant engine-in temperatures were set at 90\u00b0C with flows \nmaintained constant. The exhaust and EGR systems were particularly complex since \nthey had the difficult task of replicating the 4-cylinder engine systems by providing the \nsame functionalities and gas handling dynamic characteristics while being fed by a \nsingle cylinder. Beyond its primary role, the exhaust system was designed to provide a \nstable exhaust gas supply for EGR. In an effort to reduce the effect of pulsating gas \nflows, an exhaust chamber was inserted upstream from the EGR supply point. Although \nthe overall size of the EGR circuit has been increased on the single-cylinder engine \n(over the production engine), the addition of two heat exchangers, a bypass, two \ntemperature control valves and a rate valve have the advantage of providing a level of \nfunctionality rare in engine test facilities. The emissions analysis system comprised of \nan AVL 415 Variable Sampling Smoke Meter and a HORIBA MEXA 7100DEGR \nexhaust gas analyser. In addition an AVL 733 Dynamic Fuel Meter was used. The fuel \n 4 \nused throughout the investigations was Diesel BP FORD reference fuel with ultra-low \nsulphur Diesel fuel with a cetane number of 53.5, a density of 835 kg\/m3 and a gross \ncalorific value of 46 MJ\/kg. The test cell and data acquisition were managed using a \ncustom-built controller, while an EMTRONIX controller was used for the injection-\nsystem with high-speed data acquired using an MTS CAS system. Emissions data were \ncollected and averaged over 30s while 100 cycles of high-speed data were collected. \n2.2. Approach \nThe investigations focused on matching emissions and fuel consumption and the in-\ncylinder pressure profile during the engine cycle as well as derived parameters such as \nthe rate of pressure change. Both qualitative and quantitative information were used to \nexplain the various effects observed on the combustion during the investigations. \nQualitative assessments were made of the shape of the pressure profile during the initial \npart of the combustion, the portion of the premixed combustion, defined by a peak \nshape, and diffusion combustion, defined by a lower rate of pressure change. The \nquantitative data, derived from the mean cylinder pressure traces, were the start and end \nof combustion, the maximum rate of pressure change and the phasing of the heat release \nor pressure change relative to TDC. Early in the course of the investigation, it was \nfound that single-cycle profiles of rates of pressure change offered the most \nrepresentative data due to the characteristics defined by the PCCI combustion. This was \ndue to the fact that, despite an apparent combustion stability there was a temporal cycle-\nto-cycle variation where ensemble averaging could lead to a smoothed, unrepresentative \nprofile, with longer duration and lower rates as depicted in Figure 1. As a consequence, \nbefore the analysis could progress, a single, representative engine cycle was selected for \neach test point from the 100 engine cycles. The selection was based on it offering a \ngood representation of the combustion, in terms of start of combustion and angle of 50 \n% burn. In the illustration shown in Figure 1, the selection of the pressure trace 2 would \nhave been made. \n3. Effect of compression ratio \nThe aim of the reduced compression ratio is to reduce the in-cylinder temperatures, \nhence flame temperatures during the combustion to suppress NOx emissions. Major \nreductions have not been implemented to date due to the associated negative effect on \ncold-start capability. In view of the developments in cold-start technology and with the \nappearance of variable compression ratio technology, this route now appears to be a \nfeasible option for future engines. In order to exploit these possibilities, modifications \nwere made to the piston to reduce the compression ratio from 18.4 to 16.0:1 in the Build \n#2 engine. The compression ratio reduction was achieved by reducing the bowl pip size \n(Figure 2), while maintaining a production engine squish height, which directly \ninfluences mixing and injector targeting. \nThe main objective for these investigations was to understand the impact of \ncompression ratio on the fuel-air mixing and combustion characteristics at part load. \nThree key operating points were defined KP1, 1500 rev\/min 3.0 bar GIMEP, KP2 2000 \nrev\/min 7.7 bar GIMEP and KP3 2000 rev\/min and 10.8 bar GIMEP. They were chosen \nto be representative of light to high load conditions, which predominate in the European \ndrive cycle. Injection-timing responses conducted on the Build #1 engine were repeated \non the Build #2 engine with particular attention given to match Build #2 engine \n 5 \noperating conditions, performance and emissions with those of Build #1, as can be seen \nin Table 2. \nSince it was likely that there would be slight discrepancies between the multi and single \ncylinder engines, the aim was only to adjust the main-injection quantity to achieve the \ngross load (GIMEP), as this approach constituted an accurate measurement on a single-\ncylinder engine and enabled the investigations to focus on the compression and \nexpansion strokes, avoiding complications with the differences in pumping and friction \nlosses. Although the intention had been to match the injection strategy between builds it \nwas found necessary to modify the pilot injection slightly at the lower compression ratio \nto achieve satisfactory combustion. The main characteristics analysed are indicated on \nFigure 3. \nFigure 4 shows the impact of compression ratio on NOx emissions recorded at the \nthree loads tested. NOx emissions decreased as the injection timing was retarded, and \nwere also lowered when the compression ratio was reduced from 18.4:1 to 16.0:1. The \nreductions were more pronounced at the higher loads KP2 and KP3. At the light load \nKP1, only small benefits from the lower compression ratio were observed, likely to be \nlinked with the already limited high-temperature, stoichiometric combustion. As the \ninjection timing was retarded, the emissions differences between engine builds became \nnegligibly small, which would suggest that the influence of in-cylinder pressure and \ntemperature was reduced below a threshold, as was already the case at KP1. This \nhighlights that NOx emissions under premixed combustion were mainly controlled by \nother operating conditions such as AFR and EGR rate, rather than temperature and \npressure. \nThe effects of a reduced compression ratio on the in-cylinder pressure and \ntemperature reached at auto-ignition are shown in Figure 5, as a function of the injection \ntiming. The maximum temperatures reached before the combustion were lower for a \ncompression ratio of 16:1, as calculated using the perfect gas law and polytropic \ncoefficients derived from high-speed pressure data. The temperatures dropped from \n260\u00b0C to 230\u00b0C at KP1 and from 175\u00b0C to 150\u00b0C at KP3 in Build #2 engine. This did \nnot represent a large reduction relative to the peak flame temperatures but would act in \ntwo ways. Firstly, it would delay the auto-ignition hence increase the mixing time, \nwhich further reduces the starting temperature for the combustion along the expansion \nstroke. Secondly, the rate of combustion would reduce, as the fuel-air mixing would \nreduce the portion of stoichiometric fuel-air mixture. The lower pressures during the \ninjection event would enhance fuel-air mixing by enabling the fuel spray to penetrate \nfurther and entrain more air. This increased mixing is also expected to delay auto-\nignition and assist the mixture to lean out. \nThe fact that NOx emissions converged at the most retarded injection timings in \nFigure 4, but that the in-cylinder pressures and temperatures did not, emphasises that \nNOx emissions were not solely dependent on pressure or temperature. This contradicts \nthe generally accepted strong link between temperatures at the start of combustion and \nNOx emissions. At the light load KP1, an examination of the rates of pressure change \nshowed that the combustion profile resembled a fully-premixed charge combustion for \nboth engine builds and across all injection timings. This led to very similar NOx \nemissions in both cases, which were therefore less sensitive to in-cylinder pressure or \ntemperature. However, an observation of the rates of pressure change at KP2 and KP3 \nrevealed a change in the combustion type during the injection-timing response. It \nprogressed from combined premixed and diffusion combustion at the most advanced \n 6 \ninjection timings to largely premixed-charge combustions at the more retarded injection \ntimings. The fact that NOx emissions converged as diffusion combustion reduced \nconsolidated the conclusions of Heywood [12] that NOx emissions formed during \ndiffusion combustion of a close-to-stoichiometric mixture are very sensitive to in-\ncylinder pressures and temperatures. These results imply that NOx emissions formed \nduring premixed combustion are less affected by in-cylinder pressure or temperature \nand highlight the existence of the third factor, the combination of AFR and EGR rate or \nlocal oxygen concentration, which seems to become dominant below a certain \ntemperature threshold or during fully-premixed-charge combustion events. \nAs can be seen in Figure 6, the lower in-cylinder pressures and temperatures, as well \nas the increased mixing contributed to delay in auto-ignition. For comparable injection \ntimings, the start of combustion was generally delayed by 2 to 4\u00b0CA. These increased \nauto-ignition delays were in line with optical spray-rig observations made in Ref. [13]. \nThe increased delay which resulted in longer mixing times gives rise to larger \npremixed-combustion phases and conversely less diffusion combustion. The impact of \nthe lower pressure and increased auto-ignition delay are cumulative, since the delay also \nallowed more time for the fuel to penetrate still further. At the light load KP1, where \nthere was fully-premixed-charge combustion, the slower rate of combustion of the same \namount of fuel due to the lower compression ratio or retarded injection timing also led \nto a lower maximum rate of pressure change, as can be seen in Figure 7. However, in \nthe case of combined premixed and diffusion combustion, typical at higher loads, it is \nbelieved that an increased portion of premixed-fuel burning simultaneously \ncompensated for the slower rate of combustion, which can be seen in the maximum \nrates of pressure change. This would be consistent with the high noise levels recorded \nwith HCCI. \nBoth high noise and NOx emissions are usually associated with high rates of pressure \nchange, since these are a result of a rapid rate of combustion during premixed-\ncombustion. This consequently leads to a high increase in the in-cylinder temperature, \nand hence a faster rate of combustion during the diffusion-combustion phase, thereby \nleading to a greater proportion of NOx forming conditions. However, it is thought that \nengine noise with a highly, but not fully, premixed-charge combustion should not be \nconsidered as an indication of NOx emissions but as an indication of rapid and \npredominantly premixed-combustion. A comment can be made concerning the variation \nwith injection timing at each key point. KP1 results are expected to be the most accurate \nsince they were obtained for fully-premixed-charge combustion which is characterised \nby a smooth pressure change profile. However, obtaining a maximum rate of pressure \nchange during combustion events with both premixed and diffusion combustion \npresented difficulties, in processing and hence in drawing conclusions. \nAlthough not as pronounced as for engine out NOx emissions, reducing the \ncompression did lead to lower soot emissions within the measurement accuracy of the \nsmoke meter. The main effect was seen at the light load KP1 where smoke emissions \nwere almost halved in Build #2 engine compared with Build #1 engine (Figure 8). It is \nbelieved that PM was formed during the combustion in Build #1 engine but that in-\ncylinder temperatures were too low to promote its post-combustion oxidation. In the \ncase of Build #2 engine, it is believed that the increased mixing associated with the \nlower compression ratio suppressed PM formation, eliminating the need for high in-\ncylinder temperatures for the oxidation process. \nThe compression ratio did not seem to affect fuel consumption very much, as seen in \n 7 \nFigure 9, which shows the fuel consumption during injection-timing responses at the \nthree loads tested in both engine builds. The difference between engine builds was close \nto the measurement accuracy of +\/- 1.0 % and may therefore be considered negligible \nexcept at key point 3, where a clear increase in fuel consumption is seen. Since the tests \nwere carried out at fixed gross indicated load, the fuel consumption was a measure of \nthe fuel conversion efficiency and concealed any differences in friction. \nThe impact of the change of compression ratio on HC emissions was largest at the \nlowest load condition KP1. It is believed that the conditions for HC formation are more \nprevalent at light loads with lower in-cylinder pressures and temperatures leading to \nover-leaning and quenching of the flame and thus to HC emissions. The increase of HC \nemissions follows a similar reasoning as for PM, where the lower compression ratio \nengine offers a reduced pressure at the start of injection and a longer penetration time \ndue to the increased auto-ignition delay and subsequent increased penetration of the fuel \nspray into the chamber. This leads to excessive fuel-air dilution from increased mixing \nat the boundary of the mixture. In addition, the increased penetration of the fuel spray is \nmore likely to reach the colder cylinder walls or piston bowl, as in gasoline \napplications, which provides ideal conditions for flame quenching, incomplete \ncombustion and pool fires. It was found that CO emissions varied similarly to HC \nemissions. \n4. Conclusions \nThe work described has shown how compression ratio and injection timing assist in \nachieving lower NOx and soot emissions over a broader operating region. This \napproach has aimed to achieve HCCI operation levels of engine out NOx and soot \nemissions whilst minimising HC and CO emissions. The exploration of the \nfundamentals of Diesel combustion to achieve low engine-out emissions has resulted in \nan improved understanding of the in-cylinder phenomena and the relationship with \nemissions formation.  \nIn order to allow an extensive exploration, a single-cylinder Diesel engine was \nemployed and the test cell was designed such that operating conditions could be set \nindependently precluding the limitation imposed by multi-cylinder production hardware \ncharacteristics. \nThe impact of reducing compression ratio has been assessed across three part load \nconditions. In each case, as injection timing was varied, fuelling was adjusted to \nmaintain constant GIMEP. With the low compression build at part load, soot and NOx \nemissions were reduced with the latter effect diminishing as injection timing was \nretarded. It was concluded that lower pressure and temperature during the injection and \ncombustion promoted fuel-air mixing, which reduced both the rate of combustion and \nproportion of diffusion combustion. When diffusion combustion was suppressed, the \nresults showed NOx emissions to be less sensitive to in-cylinder pressure and \ntemperature. It was found that when the starting point was a fully-premixed-charge \ncombustion, reducing the compression ratio decreased the maximum rate of pressure \nchange, whereas when diffusion combustion was present, its reduction fuelled the \npremixed combustion thereby increasing the maximum rate of pressure change. These \ninvestigations have illustrated that reducing compression ratio offers similar benefits to \nthose of retarded injection timing, but that noise emissions are increased with combined \npremixed and diffusion combustion. \n 8 \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors wish to acknowledge the support received by the \u201cRoyal Commission \nfor the Exhibition of 1851\u201d through the Industrial Fellowship scheme. \nReferences \n[1] Takeda Y, Keiichi Na, Keiichi, Ni.
