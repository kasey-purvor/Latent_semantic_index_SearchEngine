If the patent\nholder is rational as is any other R&D investor, she will know that in equilibrium her patent\u2019s\nobsolescence shall not be affected by her own R&D investment, because all the R&D firms op-\nerate under perfect competition and constant returns to scale at the private level. This reconciles\nSchumpeterian theory with the empirical evidence on innovation by incumbents. It is proved that\nthe usual macroeconomic implications maintain their validity.\nKEYWORDS: Arrow effect, basic Schumpeterian model, R&D and growth, innovation by in-\ncumbents\n\u2217I would like to thank Vincenzo Denicolo`, Elhanan Helpman, Peter Howitt, Charles Jones and Paul\nSegerstrom for very useful discussions, and seminar participants at the University of Rome \u201cLa\nSapienza\u201d and at the Catholic University of Milan for comments. I am indebted to two Referees\nand to Charles Jones for very useful suggestions.\n1. Introduction\nIn virtually all Schumpeterian growth models with vertical innovation it is\nclaimed that an outsider research and development (R&D) firm has a higher\nincentive to undertake quality improving R&D than the current patent holder.\nIn fact, when considering R&D investment, the incumbent monopolist would\ninternalize its monopoly right\u2019s obsolescence and therefore would subtract its\ncurrent value from the payoff of successful innovation1. As a result, the suc-\ncessful patent holder that temporarily monopolizes each product line will never\nbe the same firm: the incumbent monopolists rest on their laurels in order to\navoid to cannibalize themselves.\nIt is well known that such a drastic theoretical implication is at odd with\nreal world evidence, in which firms tend to possess patent rights on products\nthat rendered obsolete their previous products: this prediction is tradition-\nally viewed as the main flaw of Schumpeterian growth theory (Aghion and\nHowitt 1992, Grossman and Helpman 1991, Segerstrom 1998, etc.), otherwise\nrich in important insights on the macroeconomics of growth, general equilib-\nrium innovation, and the political economy of international competition. For\nexample, Malerba and Orsenigo (1999), study the patents granted to firms\nin 1978-1991 in important countries, showing that the percentage of patents\ngranted to firms that had already innovated within their sector was 70% in\nGermany, 60% in France, 57% in Great Britain, 39% in Italy, 68% in the USA,\nand 62% in Japan. According to the authors, the percentage of patents granted\nto firms that innovated for the first time in the sector was 15% in Germany,\n24% in France, 24% in Great Britain, 42% in Italy, 18.4% in the USA, and\n16% in Japan. The remaining fractions of patents granted in the period in\neach country accrued to the (often large) firms which had already innovated\nin other sectors (lateral diversification). Hence, the evidence points to a quite\nmixed scenario, in which the incumbents seem to dominate innovation in a\nseemingly irregular way. This and similar evidence seem strongly at odds with\nthe clearcut implication - no R&D by incumbents - traditionally ascribed to\nthe basic Schumpeterian theory.\nSeveral important models - e.g. Barro and Sala\u2014I-Martin (1995), Stein\n(1997), Segerstrom and Zolnierek (1999), Denicolo\u2019 (2001), Etro2 (2004) and\nSegerstrom (2006) - have been introducing additional assumptions into the\n1See for example Grossman and Helpman (1991), Aghion and Howitt (1998) and Barro\nand Sala-I-Martin (2004).\n2Which refers to a working paper version of this article (p. 298, footnote 22) and recog-\nnizes the validity of its result under constant returns to scale R&D technologies. Section 3\nwill show how my result continues to hold with decreasing returns to scale in the innovation\n1\nCozzi: The Arrow Effect under Competitive R&D\nPublished by The Berkeley Electronic Press, 2007\nSchumpeterian growth framework in order to predict positive equilibriumR&D\nby the incumbents. This line of research cast light on important industrial\nfeatures (incumbent\u2019s distribution channels, better R&D experience\/ability\nby the previous patent holder, incumbent\u2019s visibility and Stackelberg R&D\nleadership) that considerably extended Schumpeterian growth theory. Clearly,\nin order to reconcile the theoretical predictions with a seemingly patternless\nevidence, one would need to introduce a lot of heterogeneity in the assumed\nleaders\u2019 cost advantages and visibility.\nIn this paper I claim that even the original Aghion and Howitt\u2019s (1992)\nbasic Schumpeterian economy was not at odd with the available empirical ev-\nidence because it did not predict that in a dynamic general equilibrium with\nperfectly competitive R&D sectors no innovation should be carried out by the\nincumbent. The reason is very simple and applies to all Schumpeterian equi-\nlibrium growth models whereby product quality, respectively unit production\ncost, undertake upward, respectively downward, jumps as a consequence of\npurposeful R&D by profit seeking frms in perfectly competitive R&D markets.\nIf any outsider can run the R&D technology at the same efficiency level as the\nincumbent and if there are increasing marginal costs of R&D at the sectorial\nlevel but constant returns at the individual level, then a perfectly competitive\nincumbent is a price taker, not a quantity taker: outsiders\u2019 R&D level is not\nknown before the incumbent\u2019s. Theoretically speaking, as each R&D frm size\nis indeterminate, the Walrasian auctioneer will select prices only for consistent\nindividual participations to the unique amount of total R&D that clears the\nlabor market. Hence given everybody\u2019s optimal strategy, at the equilibrium\nprices the incumbent is indifferent on its own R&D investment.\nAccording to my analysis, the basic Schumpeterian model laid down by\nAghion and Howitt (1992) exactly replicates the most irregular evidence: if\nleaders are indifferent, we should expect for their participation to R&D all\nsorts of patterns. Paradoxically, as a consequence of the interpretation of\nthe Arrow effect suggested by this paper, it is if leaders have research and\ndistribution advantages that we should make more drastic preditions, perhaps\nconflicting with the data.\nOur result can be readily extended to a multisector framework. Instead,\nit does not apply to an alternative framework such as Aghion et al (2001)\nin which, as in Reinganum (1983), R&D inputs are firm specific. In CRS\ncases where all R&D inputs are freely tradeable and there are industry-specific\nlimitational factors, the potential entrants uniquely pin down the amount of\nR&D investment targeting any particular product line, thereby pegging the\nsectors and price (i.e. perfect) competition.\n2\nThe B.E.

The incumbent\u2019s R&D choice then amounts to the\nchoice of how many tickets to buy of a fair lottery whose odds are independent\nof its R&D decision.\n2. The Arrow Effect and Basic Schumpeterian Growth\nTo help dissipate almost two decades of incorrect interpretation of the Arrow\neffect in general equilibrium models with perfectly competitive R&D, I think it\nis useful to the reader to put my argument in the simplest possible perspective.\nFor this reason, the reader is invited to tolerate the following \"prelude\" that\ntries to cast a bridge between the elementary microeconomic theory of perfectly\ncompetitive industries and Schumpeterian R&D and growth theory.\n2.1. Prelude: a Simple Perfectly Competitive Industry\nLet us assume an industry having a perfectly competitive structure. Each\nfirm, in continuous time, at any instant \u03c4 \u2265 0 can produce an amount \u03bb > 0\nof output flow by employing one unit of flow labor under constant returns to\nscale. There is free entry and exit. The market price of each unit of output\nis constant and denoted3 p \u2261 Vt+1At+1 . Moreover, assume that, the unique input\nemployed, labor, is offered - in amounts n \u2265 0 - to this industry as an increasing\nfunction\nn = S(\u03c9) \u2261 L\u2212 ex(\u03c9)\nof wage \u03c9 > 0, with ex0(\u03c9) < 0. This would generate the upward sloping labor\nsupply curve depicted in Figure 1.\n3For reasons to be clarified later.\n3\nCozzi: The Arrow Effect under Competitive R&D\nPublished by The Berkeley Electronic Press, 2007\nS\n(-1)\n(0)\nLabor Demand \nnt=S(OVt+1\/ At+1)\nOVt+1\/ At+1\nZ\nZ=S(-1)(n)\nLabor\nSupply\nnLO\nFigure 1 \nLabor Market Equilibrium in a Perfectly Competitive Industry \n4\nThe B.E. Journal of Macroeconomics, Vol. 7 [2007], Iss. 1 (Contributions), Art. 2\nhttp:\/\/www.bepress.com\/bejm\/vol7\/iss1\/art2\nWe can invert the labor supply function by writing \u03c9 = S(\u22121)(n), with\nS(\u22121)0(n) > 0 at all levels of n. As shown in Figure 1, the equilibrium em-\nployment level will be equal the unique number, nt, such that the value of the\nmarginal product of labor is equal to wage, that is:\n\u03bb\nVt+1\nAt+1\n= S(\u22121)(nt) \u2261 \u03c9t. (2.1)\nHence the unique industry-wide equilibrium employment level is equal to\nnt = S(\u03bb\nVt+1\nAt+1\n) \u2261 L\u2212 ex(\u03bb Vt+1At+1 ).\nThis of course leaves the firm size indeterminate, as well as the number of\nfirms. Let N denote the equilibrium number of operating firms and ni, i =\n1, 2, ..., N their positive employment levels, with\nPN\ni=1 n\ni = nt. What would\nhappen if one of these firms, say firm 1, decides to hire fewer workers? Would\nthis lead to a decrease in aggregate equilibrium employment? Microeconomic\ntheory tells us that it will not, otherwise the real wage would become lower\nthan the value of the marginal product of labor. What would happen if one\nof the firm, say firm 1, decides to hire more workers? Would this lead to\nan increase in aggregate equilibrium employment? Microeconomic theory tells\nus that it will not - unless firm 1 hires more than nt labor units - because\notherwise the real wage would become higher than the value of the marginal\nproduct of labor.\nLet us now assume that, for some reason, the owner of one and only one of\nthe firms, say firm 1, dislikes this industry\u2019s total employment: for example,\nassume that B(n) is the pecuniary equivalent of its disutility and that its\nexpected profit can be written as \u03c01(n1, n) \u2261\n\u00b3\n\u03bb Vt+1At+1 \u2212 \u03c9t\n\u00b4\nn1 \u2212 B(n), with\nB0(n) < 0 for all n \u2265 0. Notice that n1 is firm 1\u2019s choice variable, whereas\nn is the aggregate employment level in this industry, capturing the negative\nexternality of industry-wide employment on firm 1. In this environment, firm\n1\u2019s optimal quantity decision on n1 is taken at the equilibrium prices of all\noutputs and inputs, that is knowing that \u03c9 = \u03c9t and therefore that n = nt,\nunless it decides to gain monopsonistic power, which happens if it decides to\ndrive the other firms out of the market by employing n > nt. Let us remind\nthe reader that nt is a real number, not a variable, for all choices of n1 \u2264 nt.\nTherefore the industry remains perfectly competitive as long as n \u2264 nt. In\nsuch a perfectly competitive industry, by its choice of n1 firm 1 knows it would\n5\nCozzi: The Arrow Effect under Competitive R&D\nPublished by The Berkeley Electronic Press, 2007\nnot affect nt and thereby B(nt). Therefore we can write:\nd\ndn1\n\u03c01(n1, n) =\n(\n\u03bb Vt+1At+1 \u2212 \u03c9t \u2212B\n0(nt) dntdn1 = \u03bb\nVt+1\nAt+1\n\u2212 S(\u22121)(nt) = 0, if n1 \u2264 nt\n\u03bb Vt+1At+1 \u2212 S\n(\u22121)(n1)\u2212 S(\u22121)0(n1)n1 \u2212B0(n1) < 0, if n1 > nt.\n.\nAs a consequence:\nLemma 2.1. a. The unique perfectly competitive equilibrium will prevail\nwith wage \u03c9t and employment level nt safisfying eq. (2.1).\nb. Firm 1 gains zero profits in equilibrium, by optimally employing any\namount of flow labor n1 \u2208 [0, nt].\nRemark. Notice that this result is valid no matter how \"large\" firm 1 is in\nother markets - provided it holds no monopsonistic power on the same input\n- and regardless of how \"large\" firm 1 might wish to be in this industry. Also\nnotice that \u03c9t is viewed by firm 1 as a constant as long as n1 \u2264 nt, just because\n\u03c9t = S(\u22121)(nt), and n = nt for n1 \u2264 nt. This suggests that perceived dntdn1 does\nnot allow firm 1 to internalize the negative externality B(n) as well as, for any\nperfectly competing firm in this industry, the negative pecuniary externality\nS(\u22121)(n).\nDo we really need the constant returns to scale assumption for our ex-\nternality irrelevance result to hold? What if instead we had deviations from\nconstant returns, but they were entirely external to the firms? That would\namount to assuming that the private productivity \u03bb depended on aggregate\nn. If \u03bb(n) were decreasing or relatively slightly increasing, the equilibrium\nindustry employment level would still be given, implicitly, by\nnt = L\u2212 ex \u2219\u03bb(nt) Vt+1At+1\n\u00b8\n.\nTherefore, decreasing returns to scale at the industry level or sufficiently mild\nincreasing returns, provided their are external to the firm - a necessary re-\nquirement of perfect competition - would not alter our result.\n2.2. Introducing Incumbent\u2019s R&D\nIn the simplest version of the pioneering Aghion and Howitt\u2019s (1992 and 1998)\nbasic Schumpeterian model with drastic innovations, an infinite number of\n6\nThe B.E. Journal of Macroeconomics, Vol. 7 [2007], Iss. 1 (Contributions), Art. 2\nhttp:\/\/www.bepress.com\/bejm\/vol7\/iss1\/art2\nperfectly competitive firms produce, at each instant of a continuous and un-\nbounded time horizon, a unique non-storable final consumer output flow, yt,\naccording to the following production function:\nyt = Atx\u03b1tM\n1\u2212\u03b1\nwhere xt is the flow of generation t = 0, 1, 2, ...intermediate product, which\nis sold monopolistically by the holder of its patent, who produces it on a one-\nto-one basis from skilled labor, whose inelastically supplied aggregate amount\nis equal to L. Moreover, M denotes manufacturing specific unskilled labor,\nwhose aggregate amount is normalized to 1. Index At is the productivity level\nassociated to the t-th intermediate good, and 0 < \u03b1 < 1.\nPerfectly competitive R&D firms hire skilled labor flow and produce a\nprobability intensity of inventing the t + 1st generation of the intermediate\ngood, with associated productivity parameter At+1 = \u03b3At, with \u03b3 > 1. The\nassumed constant returns to scale (CRS) R&D technology transforms one flow\nunit of research labor into \u03bb > 0 flow probability of innovation. As soon as\na new good is invented it gets immediately patented and produced by the\nunique patent holder, who then enjoys unconstrained monopoly profits; in\nfact the quality jump \u03b3 is here assumed high enough to render unconvenient\nfor the previous patent holder to produce when the top quality patent holder\nsets profit maximizing prices4.\nStandard arguments prove that the intermediate good monopolist\u2019s profit\nflows are \u03c0t = At\u03c0 (wt\/At), where wt is the wage rate of the skilled labor\nand \u03c0 (\u00b7) gives productivity-adjusted profit, \u03c0t\/At, as a decreasing function\nof productivity-adjusted wage wt\/At \u2261 \u03c9t. Optimal intermediate output is\nxt = ex(\u03c9t), with ex0 < 0. This implies that the skilled labor market clearing\ncondition is:\nL = ex(\u03c9t) + nt, (L)\nwhere nt is the mass of labor employed in the R&D and L is the total supply\nof skilled labor.\nThe financial arbitrage between consumer loans and firm bonds and equi-\nties, viewed as perfect substitutes implies that the annuity value of the firm\nstock, Vt, in case of liquidation be equal to the dividend per unit time plus\n4This is a case of \"drastic innovation\". For low enough quality jumps innovation is\n\"non-drastic\". It is easy to prove that our results are valid also in such a case.\n7\nCozzi: The Arrow Effect under Competitive R&D\nPublished by The Berkeley Electronic Press, 2007\nexpected capital gains or losses5 per unit time, that is\nrVt = At\u03c0 (\u03c9t)\u2212 \u03bbntVt,\nthat is:\nVt =\nAt\u03c0 (\u03c9t)\nr + \u03bbnt\n.\nWhen an R&D firm hires a flow labor unit its output will be a flow prob-\nability \u03bb > 0 of discovering the t+ 1st patent, which is worth\nVt+1 =\nAt+1\u03c0 (\u03c9t+1)\nr + \u03bbnt+1\nThis framework fits the previous subsection\u2019s perfectly competitive indus-\ntry, after interpreting labor average and marginal product of labor, \u03bb, as the\nusual output flow in patent race models: the probability per unit time of in-\nventing the relevant patentable idea (an immaterial good). The market value\nof each unit of that probability flow is exactly Vt+1, that is the present expected\nvalue of the monopolistic rents generated by the intellectual property of the\nt+1st intermediate good. Moreover, firm 1 is the incumbent monopolist - i.e.\nthe owner of the patent on intermediate good t - and B(n) is the expected loss\nof value of its current patent in productivity adjusted terms, that is \u03bbn VtAt+1 .\nThe previous subsection\u2019s analysis applies and therefore we can say that\nperfect competition in the research sector yields Aghion and Howitt\u2019s (1992)\nand (1998, ch. 2) well known R&D arbitrage condition:\n\u03c9t = \u03bb\nVt+1\nAt+1\n=\n\u03bb\u03b3\u03c0 (\u03c9t+1)\nr + \u03bbnt\n, (A)\nwhere r > 0 is the real rate of time preference in the linear instantaneous\nutility functional of the consumer.\nThe labor market clearing condition and the R&D arbitrage condition allow\nto completely describe the dynamics of this economy.\nThe R&D arbitrage condition shall hold because each skilled labor unit\n- owned by each zero measure individual - has the option of working in the\nmanufacturing sector or of self-employing herself in the R&D sector. In fact,\nthe constant returns to scale R&D technology mapping flow labor into the flow\n5In this model with infinite intertemporal elasticity of substitution it can be proved that\nthere cannot exist equilibria with non-zero deterministic capital appreciation or depreciation.\nThis is why only obsolescence is considered.\n8\nThe B.E.

Hence there is no way\nfor any firm to prevent the R&D workers from appropriating the full value of\ntheir marginal products.\nGiven productivity-adjusted real wage \u03c9t > ex(\u22121)(L)6, the amount of\nskilled labor will be inelastically supplied to the R&D sector.\nThe R&D labor demand side is guided by an indeterminate number of\npotential employers: since R&D technology can be operated at zero entrepre-\nneurial cost every agent - consumer, worker, non-human organization unit -\ncan run a \"firm\", raise funds, and hire the available skilled workers. Hence\neach such firm must earn zero profits.\nThe perfect competition assumption rules out the possibility of any agree-\nment between market participants - be they R&D firms, skilled workers, or\nfinancial intermediaries - to affect aggregate employment and wage. More-\nover, there exist no firm-specific factors: all relevant factors are freely tradable\nwithin the industry. If non-tradable firm-specific factors were assumed, our\nresults would change, as in Aghion et al.\u2019s (2001) investigation of the effects\nof large firms on growth.\nWhat would happen in this framework if the current monopolist hired\nsome R&D workers? In particular what would happen if a positive mass nMt\nno larger than nt of skilled workers were hired by the intermediate good firm\nthat monopolizes the production of the leading-edge intermediate good? This\npaper claims that equations (L) and (A) would simply have to be rewritten as\nL = ex(\u03c9t) + nOt + nMt ,\nand\n\u03c9t =\n\u03bb\u03b3\u03c0 (\u03c9t+1)\nr + \u03bb\n\u00a1\nnOt+1 + n\nM\nt+1\n\u00a2 ,\nwhere nOt denotes the mass of skilled workers hired by the outsider R&D firms.\nIt is important to remark the aspects of the basic Schumpeterian model that\nare crucial to my argument. The research sector and the capital markets are\nperfectly competitive: therefore the current intermediate good monopolist has\nno market power in the R&D labor and financial markets. This implies that\nneither the intermediate monopolist firm nor any of its shareholders perceive\nany ability to affect aggregate R&D. Consequently the current leading-edge\nproduct obsolescence is taken as given and as independent of any individual\n6To get non-trivial results we will always assume this to hold.\n9\nCozzi: The Arrow Effect under Competitive R&D\nPublished by The Berkeley Electronic Press, 2007\nagent\u2019s action. The fact that the intermediate good producer - or the final\ngoods producers depending on the particular model of this class - has market\npower in its own market may have led the growth literature to adopt the logic\nof patent race models with oligopolistic R&D markets (e.g. Reinganum 1983).\nHowever, when one distinguishes between markets in which firms have the\npower to influence aggregates - and hence prices - and markets in which they\ncannot, the situation becomes more similar to the deterministic framework of\nGilbert and Newbury (1982)7.\nHowever, it is interesting to observe that all the macroeconomic and com-\nparative statics implications of Aghion and Howitt (1992) remain valid: inter-\nestingly, the Arrow effect indirectly continue to affect the aggregate dynamics\nin the case of drastic innovations though not showing up at the industry level.\nIn a steady state with constant R&D employment, nt+1 = nt = bn, and\nproductivity-adjusted wages, \u03c9t+1 = \u03c9t = b\u03c9. The equilibrium conditions\nbecome:\nL = ex(b\u03c9) + bn, (L\u2019)\nand\nb\u03c9 = \u03bb\u03b3\u03c0 (b\u03c9)\nr + \u03bbbn (A\u2019)\nEquations (L\u2019) and (A\u2019) uniquely determine the steady state value of all the\nendogenous variables.

Journal of Macroeconomics, Vol. 7 [2007], Iss. 1 (Contributions), Art. 2\nhttp:\/\/www.bepress.com\/bejm\/vol7\/iss1\/art2\nby the competitive fringe of R&D firms would be nO = bn \u2212 nM \u2265 0, with\nno change in the aggregate amount of R&D employment and therefore in the\nexpected growth rate.\n2.3. Perfect Competitive R&D and Arrow Effect\nIn this section - with no loss of generality - we will restrict the analysis to the\nsteady state. In what follows we prove that under the competitive assump-\ntions of Aghion and Howitt (1992) the unique steady state has to satify the\nprevious equations (L\") and (A\"), leaving the incumbent\u2019s participation to\nR&D indetermined.\nThe most important question is the following: is the monopolist\u2019s R&D\nemployment nM \u2208 [0, bn] convenient at the equilibrium wage and prices? In a\nsimultaneous game such as our competitive market with externality this de-\npends on what all other market participants are doing. Let us remind that\nthe incumbent\u2019s stock market value, Vt+1, is determined by the current expec-\ntations about the future R&D employment levels8. Since each of an infinite\nnumber of potential entrants has constant returns to scale their R&D labor\ndemand correspondence is equal to zero for wt > \u03c9At, to infinity if the reverse\ninequality holds, and to any amount for wt = \u03c9At. Under perfect competi-\ntion it is as if every firm\u2019s R&D labor demand correspondence and worker\u2019s\nlabor supply correspondence were simultaneously communicated to the mar-\nket maker - that is to the frictionless theoretical Walrasian auctioneer - who\nwould then find a wage level for which there exist a distribution of quantity de-\nmanded and supplied belonging to the corresponding set values of the demand\nand supply correspondences, and that clear the market. Given its knowledge\nof the market clearing mechanism and of the strategies of all the other mar-\nket participants, the monopolist\u2019s best response would be to prescribe a labor\ndemand equal to zero for wt > \u03c9At and to any amount in [0, bn] for wt = \u03c9At.\nThe reason is that it recognizes that given the outsiders\u2019 optimal strategies\nand the Walrasian market mechanism it will never be able to reduce the flow\nprobability of its product t obsolescence for wage levels wt lower than or equal\nto \u03c9At.\nNotice that for the competitive labor market to drive wages to full em-\nployment (L\u2019) and the perfectly competitive capital markets to exhaust all\nprofitable R&D investment opportunities until arbitrage condition (A\u2019) is sat-\nisfied it is not necessary that the outsiders can observe in advance the action of\n8Which will directly affect future obsolescence and indirectly affect future monopoly\nprofits.\n11\nCozzi: The Arrow Effect under Competitive R&D\nPublished by The Berkeley Electronic Press, 2007\nthe monopolist: the Walrasian auctioneer shall know it and re-assign outsiders\u2019\nquantities.\nIn such a perfectly competitive market for R&D labor with an externality\non the intermediate good monopolist the total amount of R&D labor employed\nis dictated by the unique equilibrium and at the corresponding wage level the\nmonopolist\u2019s net expected revenue from investing nM\u03c9At is nM\u03bbVt+1 for all\nnM \u2208 [0, bn]. Hence the monopolist is as indifferent as any R&D firm in its\noptimal R&D investment: the identity of the R&D firms to which the real or\nfictional market maker will eventually assign the R&D labor - thereby resolv-\ning the indeterminacy inherent in the constant returns framework - does not\nalter aggregate obsolesce but only individual participation to the gains from\nthe innovative lottery. As in all competitive markets with constant returns to\nscale, the size of operation by each firm is indeterminate: the market mak-\ners\u2019 activity - stilyzed by the theoretical Walrasian auctioneer device - plays\nexactly the role of assigning this scale arbitrarily without violating agents\u2019 de-\nmand\/supply correspondences. Hence the incumbent cannot take other firms\u2019\nR&D quantities as given before an equilibrium is reached: it can only take\nprices as given. Therefore:\nProposition 2.2. In the unique positive steady state of the basic Schum-\npeterian model with drastic innovations equations (L\") and (A\") hold, and\nthe mass nM of R&D labor the incumbent intermediate good monopolist hires\nin the unique steady state can be any number in [0, bn].\nCorollary 2.3. Aghion and Howitt\u2019 s (1992) macroeconomic analysis holds\nwith no modification in its implications about the aggregate growth rate, the\naggregate R&D employment, wages, prices, and profits, and all other aggregate\nvariables. Moreover, it is robust to any evidence of incumbents\u2019 undertaking\nR&D up to bn.\nNotice that it is not even necessary that nM stays constant over time,\nprovided that it never exceed bn.\nKey to understanding our result is a correct interpretation of the tricky\naspects of the perfectly competitive R&D sector assumed in the basic Schum-\npeterian economy. In fact, given a real wage level the total supply of R&D\nlabor is given at the sectoral level; when an R&D firm demands one more flow\nunit of R&D labor at the equilibrium wage its demand will be satisfied if and\nonly if that unit of labor does not get an alternative research job within the\nsame sector. Otherwise the wage rate would rise and the firm would not de-\nmand it any more. Hence at the equilibrium wage an individual firm\u2019s hiring\n12\nThe B.E. Journal of Macroeconomics, Vol. 7 [2007], Iss. 1 (Contributions), Art. 2\nhttp:\/\/www.bepress.com\/bejm\/vol7\/iss1\/art2\none more R&D labor unit does not create an additional supply of R&D labor\nfor the whole R&D sector: it simply forces a particular allocation of a given\namount of aggregate R&D employment. But by not increasing aggregate R&D\nemployment in that sector it cannot increase the obsolescence of the current\nincumbent. Therefore its ability to hire more of a given pool of R&D labor\nonly increases its own chances of making the innovation and of appropriat-\ning its fruits: this is equivalent to buying one more ticket in a lottery with a\npredermined success probability.\nRedistributing R&D employment across firms is like redistributing the own-\nership of the success probabilities, but the sum of these probabilities is deter-\nmined only by the aggregate supply of R&D labor at the equilibrium wage.\nThe common argument proving the Arrow effect typically says that the\nincumbent by buying a marginal unit of R&D labor increases its chances of\nwinning the next patent race and of losing its current patent value. However,\nwhenever there is only one level of aggregate R&D labor employment for each\nwage rate, though the incumbent\u2019s marginal chances of being the winner really\ndepend on its own marginal R&D employment decision, the probability of its\ncurrent patent\u2019s becoming obsolete only depends on the total amount of R&D\nlabor supplied to the sector - and pinned down by the real wage.\n2.4. Is Arrow Effect Anywhere?\nIt is useful to comment on the previous result and in particular on its rela-\ntionship with the so called Arrow effect. Actually, we can say that the Arrow\neffect is still at work, but not in the sense usually intended by the literature.\nOf course, the common belief that the incumbent should do no research turns\nout to be incorrect: in light of the previous analysis of the basic Schumpeterian\nmodel, we should not be surprised to observe that in the real world the in-\ncumbent monopolists do a lot of R&D and hold sequential patents. However\nit is absolutely true that the aggregate variables behave as if R&D were un-\ndertaken only by outsider R&D firms aiming to challenge the current product\nso as to displace the current incumbent. This paper suggests that it is in this\nsense that the Arrow effect should be interpreted.\nMoreover our result is similar in the spirit to the industrial organization\nclassic result on contestable markets. In fact it is the potential competition\nof free entrants that suffices to discipline the monopolist\u2019s R&D policy. Were\nthe R&D market not open to outsider firms, the monopolist would be the only\none to invest and its investment decision would internalize its business stealing.\nHence restricting entry into R&D may severely reduce R&D investment and\n13\nCozzi: The Arrow Effect under Competitive R&D\nPublished by The Berkeley Electronic Press, 2007\ninnovation. However, it is important to remark that it is the potential entry\nthat matters for innovation. Similarly, more efficient capital markets and\nventure capitalists may have important beneficial effects on growth even if\ntheir activity in financing start up R&D firms is only potential.\n3. Multisector Extensions\nIn the multisector extensions of the basic Schumpeterian model (e.g. Gross-\nman and Helpman 1991a and 1991b, Segerstrom 1998, Howit 1999, Li 2003),\nfirm-specific R&D intensities Ii add up to the industry-wide R&D intensity I\ndue to the assumption that the returns to R&D intensities are independent\nacross firms within the same industry, across industries and over time. It is\nmost common to solve quality ladders models by imposing symmetric R&D ef-\nforts across product lines. However this is only a simplified methodology used\nwhen there are no decreasing returns to R&D at the sectorial level, that allow\nto uniquely determine the R&D levels and therefore to solve the one period\nindeterminacy inherent in these models with a linear cross-sector R&D trans-\nformation function9. In such a setting the supply of R&D labor per-sector is\nnot uniquely pinned down by the wage rate. Therefore it is not per se incorrect\nto assume that any R&D firm\u2019s marginal hiring can affect that sector\u2019s R&D\nlabor. However, with a more general and realistic microfoundation leading to\na strictly concave cross-sector R&D transformation function10 our argument\napplies, whenever R&D is perfectly competitive.\nFor example, by assuming a sectorial fixed factor that renders the single\nfirm\u2019s success probability of R&D in a particular sector strictly decreasing\nin the aggregate R&D in the sector - as e.g. in Dinopoulos and Segerstrom\n(1999) - we can easily rule out the industrial organization implications of the\nArrow effect along the lines of the previous section. More specifically, we\ncould express the instantaneous success probability of R&D I(\u03c9, t) in sector\n\u03c9 \u2208 [0; 1] at time t > 0 as in Dinopoulos and Segerstrom\u2019s (1999) eq. (4)\n9An analysis of the growth consequences of such an indeterminacy in the quality ladders\nmodel is provided by Cozzi (2006).\n10Of course, models with a linear transformation function are as useful as more compli-\ncated models in analyzing Schumpeterian growth. Hence there is no lack of generality and\nrealism in so long as their macroeconomic focus is concerned. What I am trying to empha-\nsize here is that some of their macroeconomic implications do not hold when more generality\nand realism is included. Instead of weakening it, this paper shows that incumbent\u2019s R&D\ninvolvement shall not be taken as evidence against Schumpeterian growth theory.\n14\nThe B.E. Journal of Macroeconomics, Vol. 7 [2007], Iss. 1 (Contributions), Art. 2\nhttp:\/\/www.bepress.com\/bejm\/vol7\/iss1\/art2\nI(\u03c9, t) \u2261 ALI(\u03c9, t)\n\u03b1hI(\u03c9, t)1\u2212\u03b1\nXI(\u03c9, t)\nwhere hI(\u03c9, t) is the amount of \"workers with specialized R&D skills\" in\nsector \u03c9 (Dinopoulos and Segerstrom, 1999), and where LI(\u03c9, t) are \"workers\nwith general R&D skills\". Alternatively, following Segerstrom et al. (1990),\nwe could assume a negative sectorial externality of R&D and derive the unique\nsteady state R&D employment level from the zero profit condition.\nAs the reader can easily see, these routes allow us to uniquely pin down each\nsector\u2019s R&D intensity in a formally similar way as in Aghion and Howitt\u2019s\n(1992) steady state. Of course, in their model the upward sloping aggregate\nsupply of R&D workers was due to general equilibrium effects through man-\nufacturing decreasing marginal returns to skilled labor, whereas here it is the\ngeneral-skill R&D labor aggregate demand that slopes down due to partial\nequilibrium effects (decreasing returns in own sector\u2019s R&D). However, given\nthe individual firms\u2019 infinitely elastic labor demands at the wage rate solving\nthe arbitrage condition any R&D firm\u2019s - including the incumbent manufactur-\ning firm\u2019s - marginal decision to hire general-skill R&D labor cannot increase\nits total employment in the sector. More employment by any firm can only be\ncoupled with less employment by other firms, but never with more employment\nby the whole.\nWith non-drastic innovations in a Grossman and Helpman\u2019 s (1991a and\nb) economy, the quality advantage (which determines prices) of a leader who\ninnovated twice may not become \u03bb2 because \"potential entrants can, via in-\nspection of the goods on the market, learn enough about the state of knowledge\nto mount their own research efforts, even if the patent laws [...] prevent them\nfrom manufacturing the current generation products\" (Grossman and Help-\nman 1991a, p. 47). Alternatively, as often assumed, the previous leading-edge\ntechnology becomes prior knowledge and the patent on this technology ex-\npires. In both cases the quality difference between the leader and the followers\nis given by \u03bb, i.e. by the size of one innovation. Thus, product prices and\nmonopoly profits do not change.\n4. Conclusions\nIn this paper I have shown that there is no reason to expect that the Schum-\npeterian growth model with vertical innovations imply that the monopolist\nfirm or its shareholders should not undertake R&D. This contrasts the tradi-\ntional interpretation of the Arrow effect, though the Arrow effect is vindicated\n15\nCozzi: The Arrow Effect under Competitive R&D\nPublished by The Berkeley Electronic Press, 2007\nat the macroeconomic level. In this sense the existing empirical evidence of\nsequential patenting by the same firms or individuals should not be taken as\nevidence against the basic Schumpeterian growth theory.\nThe usual empirical critique to the Schumpeterian models of quality lad-\nders crucially hinges on an interpretation of their R&D sector that employs\na peculiar game-theoretic model of investment (e.g., each firm chooses its in-\nvestment, taking that of its rivals as given). Thus each firm has a small but\npositive impact on aggregate investment; in this case, the incumbent invests\nnothing. This impact becomes increasingly small as the number of firms grows,\nbut the limit is taken along this equilibrium path, where the incumbent in-\nvests zero for each value of n. Instead by literally following the Schumpeterian\nmodel\u2019s explicit assumption of perfectly competitive R&D, it is correct to say\nthat a perfectly-competitive model yields an indeterminate investment for the\nincumbent, thereby predicting that incumbents should invest randomly.\nThe quantity game interpretation of the perfectly competitive R&D as-\nsumption may have been inspired by an analogy with the classic industrial\norganization\u2019s statement11 that as the number of firms in a Cournot oligopoly\ntends to infinity, with each firm\u2019s market share tending to zero, the equilib-\nrium price tends to the perfectly competitive equilibrium price. However, this\nquantitative coincidence does not mean that Cournot behavior (i.e. quantity\ntaking behavior) is the same as the perfectly competitive (i.e. price taking)\nbehavior: when the Schumpeterian models explicitly assume that R&D is per-\nfectly competitive they are not conceiving of R&D being carried out by a lot\nof Cournot competitors, which renders quantity game equilibrium limit argu-\nments not only mis-leading but inappropriate.\nAre incumbent monopolists \u2018small\u2019 firms? This is left to empirical stud-\nies, which can confirm or reject this hypothesis depending on time, sector or\ncountry. Since this paper\u2019s arguments are not restricted to the assumption\nthat industry leaders are small - namely, size does not matter in our propo-\nsitions just because equilibrium R&D firm size is indeterminate - I hope to\nhave clarified that the original Schumpeterian theory cannot be contradicted\nempirically also on these grounds, but that instead it was consistent from\nits very beginning with incumbents either doing little R&D or a lot of R&D\naimed at cannibalizing their own patent portfolios. The reason why the in-\ncumbents can be doing any amount of R&D from zero to the potentially very\nlarge amount we would expect the outsider actual and potential entrants to\nthe research sector to carry out is that the perfectly competitive market clear-\ning mechanism and the private CRS R&D technology renders the incumbent\u2019s\n11Tirole (1988, p. 220-221) and Motta (2004, p. 559).\n16\nThe B.E.

Free en-\ntry and constant returns to scale, as is well known in IO, are consistent both\nwith quantity and price competition. The empirical implication of quantity\ncompetition are known (Barro and Sala-I-Martin 2004), whereas those of price\ncompetition are shown in this paper. The controversial interpretation of the\nbasic Schumpeterian theory stems from its initially stated assumption (price\ncompetition in the R&D) and its derivation in terms of quantity competition.\nThe available empirical evidence does not falsify the interpretation in terms of\nprice competition.\nI wish to emphasize that such an acquittal12 of the original Schumpeterian\ntheory13 does not preclude new explanations, and in a sense this long period\nof misunderstanding of its original properties had the virtue of stimulating\nthe researchers to explore potentially useful alternatives to the assumption\nof free entry into a simultaneous R&D activities by outsiders having equal\nopportunities. For example, once one observes empirically14 that incumbents\nare not small, and brings enough evidence that it be more realistic to assume\nthat the quality leader has some market power also in the R&D market and\nthus can act as a Stackelberg leader in its own industry, then, we will find\nthe models of Barro and Sala-i-Martin, 2004, Denicol\u00f2, 2001, Etro (2004), and\nSegerstrom (2006) more appropriate.\nReferences\nP.
