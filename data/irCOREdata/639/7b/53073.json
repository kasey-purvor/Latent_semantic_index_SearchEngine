Many current groundwater vulnerability maps, and the 12 \ngeological maps on which they are based, do not adequately account for regional and vertical 13 \nvariations in the characteristics of superficial deposits. A new methodology for characterising 14 \nrecharge potential and contaminant retardation potential of superficial deposits is presented here 15 \nwhich captures primary geological and hydrogeological expert knowledge in a systematic 16 \nmanner.  The method modifies existing superficial geology maps using Quaternary domains and 17 \ntheir descriptions, bedrock lithology, thickness of superficial deposits and applies additional 18 \ninformation on superficial geology and bedrock lithology. Central to the methodology is a matrix 19 \nwhich enables local geological and hydrogeological knowledge to be incorporated in a 20 \nsystematic and traceable manner. The scale-independent methodology has been piloted at 21 \n1:625 000 scale to produce maps of recharge and attenuation potential for Great Britain. 22 \nPreliminary verification against several indicators (HOST data, the Scottish vulnerability 23 \nscreening tool, and nitrate data) has been encouraging. The method is being used by the 24 \nKJG 2of 24 04\/03\/2011 \nEnvironment Agency as part of its vulnerability assessments for the characterization of 25 \ngroundwater bodies as required by the Water Framework Directive (Council of European 26 \nCommunities 2000).  27 \n28 \nKJG 3of 24 04\/03\/2011 \nQuaternary superficial deposits cover approximately 90% of the British landmass. Superficial 29 \ndeposits, of which glacial till is a major component, moderate potential recharge to underlying 30 \nbedrock aquifers and are an important influence on vulnerability to pollution through their ability 31 \nto attenuate pollutants. Superficial deposits also influence groundwater quality (Shand et al. 32 \n2007).  Characterisation of these deposits and the processes occurring within them is critical to 33 \nthe assessment of groundwater vulnerability and the characterisation of groundwater bodies 34 \nrequired by the Water Framework Directive (Council of European Communities 2000).  35 \nGroundwater vulnerability maps for England and Wales were first developed for the National 36 \nRivers Authority in the early 1990s and are still in use today, mainly as a planning tool.  The 37 \nmaps are at 1: 100 000 scale and cover all of England and Wales (Palmer et al. 1995).  These 38 \nmaps classify the dominant soil strata above the saturated aquifer as the vulnerability indicator, 39 \nrecognising a matrix of three aquifer classes (weakly, moderately and highly permeable, 40 \nalthough on the England and Wales maps this was transposed to non, minor and major aquifer) 41 \nand three soil leaching potential classes (high, medium and low). The groundwater vulnerability 42 \nmaps for England and Wales do not consider travel time to the water table because depth to 43 \nwater was not then generally available on a regional basis (Robins et al. 1994). Furthermore, 44 \nthey were designed for a conservative pollutant that would not degrade in the unsaturated zone 45 \n(Palmer et al. 1995). 46 \nSimilar maps were produced for Scotland and Northern Ireland, but have recently been replaced 47 \nas part of the Water Framework Directive characterisation work.  New groundwater vulnerability 48 \nscreening layers were produced for Scotland at an effective scale of 1: 100 000 (\u00d3 Dochartaigh 49 \net al. 2005), and for Northern Ireland at 1:250 000 scale (Ball et al. 2005), in which the 50 \nunderlying bedrock aquifer class does not directly influence the \u2018vulnerability\u2019 rating.   51 \nIn Ireland, a slightly different approach to vulnerability mapping has been adopted (Daly and 52 \nWarren 1998; Misstear and Daly 2000). The topsoil was not taken into account but superficial 53 \ncover (known as subsoil in Ireland) is the main feature of the maps, whereas in the original 54 \nKJG 4of 24 04\/03\/2011 \nEngland and Wales vulnerability maps it was generally only considered as a secondary feature. 55 \nThe Irish approach also considers the nature of the recharge, i.e. whether it is point or diffuse.  56 \nSuperficial cover material posed a significant problem in developing the original vulnerability 57 \nmaps for England and Wales.  Where a superficial cover occurs as a granular deposit and where 58 \nit is saturated it was depicted as an intergranular aquifer.  Wherever till is greater than 5 m thick, 59 \nit was assumed to be of sufficiently low permeability to protect the underlying aquifer and was 60 \ndepicted as a stippled area denoting likely protection subject to field checking of the cover 61 \nmaterial. Glacial till may vary in composition from silty clay to sandy silt over limited horizontal 62 \nand vertical distances, with corresponding variations in permeability. It may also be fractured or 63 \nincised.   64 \nImproved information on the lithology, variability and thickness of superficial material is the 65 \ndesired next step for improved aquifer vulnerability assessments (e.g. McMillan et al. 2000; \u00d3 66 \nDochartaigh et al. 2005; Fitzsimons and Misstear 2006). Current geological maps of superficial 67 \ndeposits alone are not suitable for determining groundwater vulnerability, since superficial 68 \ndeposits within a particular mapped unit may vary significantly in composition, not only on a 69 \nlocal or regional scale but also on a national scale (Anon. 2004). 70 \nThis paper describes a new methodology for supporting assessment of groundwater vulnerability 71 \non a nationwide basis using improved characterisation of the superficial deposits. Figure 1 72 \nillustrates how this method seeks to improve groundwater vulnerability assessments through the 73 \nincorporation of Quaternary domain conceptual models, local geological and hydrogeological 74 \nknowledge, national datasets including estimates of drift thickness (part of BGS\u2019s GeoSure 75 \nnational dataset on natural ground instability across Great Britain) and site specific information 76 \n(e.g. boreholes and site investigation reports). Amalgamation of all existing information and 77 \nknowledge regarding the properties of the superficial deposits enables national maps of recharge 78 \npotential and attenuation potential to be produced. In this initial phase these maps provide 79 \nnational coverage at 1:625 000 scale but more detailed maps i.e. 1:50 000 scale are being 80 \nKJG 5of 24 04\/03\/2011 \nproduced by the Environment Agency which has recently adopted the method described in this 81 \npaper. Additionally, the maps should evolve to incorporate new information, allowing the 82 \nvulnerability classifications to be refined and improved.    83 \nFigure 1.  The available resources for improving the hydrogeological characterisation of the 84 \nsuperficial deposits. 85 \n 86 \nThe influence of superficial deposits on bedrock hydrogeology 87 \nSuperficial deposits influence the vulnerability of bedrock groundwater in two main ways (see 88 \nFigure 2). Firstly, they affect the recharge potential (Rushton 2005): the volume of water or 89 \npollutant that can travel through the superficial deposits to the bedrock aquifer below. The 90 \nrelative recharge potential relates to the superficial deposits and does not reflect whether the 91 \nunderlying aquifer (in particular bedrock) could physically accept a high, moderate or even low 92 \namount of recharge (poorly productive fractured bedrock aquifers underlie a significant 93 \nproportion of Great Britain and their ability to accept recharge due to low storage and 94 \ntransmissivity can be significantly restricted). Secondly, superficial deposits have a large impact 95 \non the potential attenuation of pollutants. Superficial deposits may often reduce the vulnerability 96 \nof an underlying aquifer to pollution by increasing both the travel time for pollutants to reach the 97 \nwater table, allowing time for degradation of some contaminants, and also retarding 98 \ncontaminants through sorption on clay surfaces or organic material.   99 \nFigure 2 Factors influencing recharge and attenuation in the sub-surface.  The methodology 100 \ndescribed in this paper is concerned only with the processes in the superficial deposits. 101 \nRecharge 102 \nRecharge through superficial deposits is largely determined by the thickness of the deposits, 103 \nlithology, vertical fracturing and the architecture of the sediments.  Investigations of the 104 \ncharacteristics of low permeability superficial deposits in North America concluded that recharge 105 \nKJG 6of 24 04\/03\/2011 \ncan occur through all Quaternary deposits, even where matrix permeability is very low (Keller et 106 \nal. 1988; van der Kamp 2001). In Great Britain it is consistently reported that recharge occurs 107 \nthrough glacial till (Klink et al. 1997; Foster 1998; Marks et al. 2004; Cuthbert 2005). Both 108 \nRushton (2005) and Fitzsimons and Misstear (2006) identify an important factor for recharge as 109 \nthe prevailing hydraulic gradient between till and underlying aquifer.  Soley and Heathcote 110 \n(1998) observed recharge of 36 mm a-1 through till on interfluves in East Anglia, decreasing to 111 \n10 mm a-1 in areas of thicker cover where the underlying Cretaceous Chalk bedrock aquifer is 112 \nlocally confined.   113 \nThe role of superficial deposit thickness and permeability in controlling recharge was 114 \nhighlighted by Daly and Warren (1998) in the context of vulnerability mapping guidelines for 115 \nIreland and further developed by Misstear et al. (2009). As unsaturated permeability can only be 116 \nmeasured experimentally, grain size is often used as an indicator. Primary permeability may also 117 \nbe enhanced by weathering and fracture development (Gerber et al. 2001).  118 \nWhere fractures occur in superficial deposits, e.g. in a fractured till, gravity by-pass flow may 119 \noccur and may be the dominant flow mechanism (Cuthbert 2005), although mainly restricted to 120 \nthe uppermost 3 m in Ireland (Misstear et al. 2008). Studies of glacial till in situ for waste 121 \ndisposal often indicate the importance of fracturing which can increase permeability by 1 \u2013 3 122 \norders of magnitude. These fractures are most common at shallow depths (<10 m) in oxidised 123 \nand weathered deposits, but can also be found at greater depths (10 \u2013 30 m) (Keller et al. 1988; 124 \nFrederica 1990; van der Kamp 2001; Cuthbert 2005). Presence of fractures will, therefore, have 125 \nan important bearing on recharge potential and the methodology considers this on a subjective 126 \nbasis.  127 \nOn rare occasions, superficial deposits may increase the vulnerability of groundwater to 128 \npollution through focussed recharge draining from the periphery of the deposits and leading to 129 \nthe development of localised karst-like features in carbonate aquifers where runoff from 130 \nsuperficial deposits may be acidic (MacDonald et al. 1998). 131 \nKJG 7of 24 04\/03\/2011 \n 132 \nAttenuation 133 \nThe processes promoting contaminant attenuation depend on the type of soil and rock, the types 134 \nof contaminant and the associated activity.   Attenuation is generally most active in the soil, 135 \nwhere bacterial activity is greatest.  The unsaturated zone, is nevertheless, of importance as it 136 \nrepresents the most widespread line of defence against pollution of groundwater (e.g. Rodvang 137 \nand Simpkins 2001).  The key indicators in the unsaturated zone relate to the process of sorption, 138 \nion exchange, filtration and precipitation.  Of these, ion exchange is the main overall process, the 139 \nothers being dependent on the nature of the pollutant as much as the nature of the unsaturated 140 \nzone medium.  In this way a single value describing the potential for the medium to attract 141 \ncations, the cation exchange capacity (CEC), is the most useful parameter in assigning its 142 \nattenuation potential.  CEC describes the process of attracting cations to a negatively charged 143 \nsurface \u2013 usually clay minerals (Appelo and Postma 1993).  However, CEC values are 144 \ncommonly not available for the vadose zone and not universally available for the soil zone.  It is 145 \nuseful, therefore, to use clay mineral content of the vadose zone as a surrogate for CEC.   146 \nA second part of the attenuation process is controlled by the availability of carbon as a catalyst 147 \nfor adsorption and precipitation in the medium (Smith and Lerner 2007).  Thus the two key 148 \nindicators used to derive the attenuation potential of the superficial material making up the 149 \nvadose zone are clay mineral and organic contents. 150 \nIncreased travel time can help the progression of attenuation processes in the Quaternary 151 \ndeposits and allow time for the contaminants to degrade.  Therefore, vertical permeability and 152 \nthickness are also factors to be considered (Foster 1998).  153 \n 154 \nQuaternary domains mapping  155 \nKJG 8of 24 04\/03\/2011 \nSubdivision of the Quaternary has always been problematic. Although an approach to 156 \nstandardisation of mapping is currently being promoted by the BGS (Anon. 2004; McMillan 157 \n2005), to date there has not been a standard approach for Great Britain. The traditional 158 \nstratigraphic subdivision of the Quaternary paid little regard to either the processes under which 159 \ndeposition took place or the lithologies that were deposited (see Figure 3 for 1:625 000 160 \nQuaternary map).  161 \nFigure 3 Superficial deposits of Great Britain at 1:625 000 scale (copyright BGS). 162 \nAn alternative approach to classification is to define characteristic regional provinces which can 163 \nbe subdivided into smaller domains (Anon. 2004). The landmass may be divided into two 164 \nprovinces, Glaciated and Non-glaciated based on landscape evolution, geomorphology and the 165 \nnature and distribution of superficial deposits. The Glaciated province includes upland and 166 \nlowland Britain and the whole of Northern Ireland. In this province much of the Quaternary 167 \nrecord has been removed or modified by subaerial erosion and successive Quaternary 168 \nglaciations. In the Non-glaciated Province, which lies to the south of the southern limit of the 169 \nAnglian glaciation, there remains a more complete record of the processes of weathering, erosion 170 \nand deposition which were driven by climate changes throughout the Quaternary (Anon. 2004).  171 \nWithin the two main Provinces, eleven domains have been differentiated (Figure 4), based partly 172 \non their geomorphology and assemblages of superficial deposits and partly on genetic linkages to 173 \nthe surface processes which formed them. A number of domains have been subdivided into sub-174 \ndomains (40 in total) to allow for local variations which largely relate to the characteristics of the 175 \nunderlying bedrock, especially in southern England.  176 \nDetailed domain assessment has yet to be made for Northern Ireland but a preliminary review 177 \nidentified six domains, the most extensive of which is the Till dominant domain which covers 80 178 \n% of the land surface of Northern Ireland. The Till dominant domain (TD) is subdivided into two 179 \nsub-domains, TD1 and TD2 on the basis of the proportion of till to rock near surface.   180 \nKJG 9of 24 04\/03\/2011 \nFigure 4 Map of the eleven main Quaternary Domains as identified by Anon. (2004).  The 181 \nboundaries of the sub domains are also outlined. 182 \nMethodology 183 \nSystematic use of additional information and expert knowledge has been applied to reinterpret 184 \nthe existing superficial deposits geological map (Figure 5). Central to the method is a data 185 \nmatrix. Within the matrix, the expert geological knowledge is captured and then re-interpreted by 186 \nhydrogeologists in terms of recharge potential and attenuation. 187 \nFigure 5 An outline of the methodology described in this paper to develop recharge and 188 \nattenuation potential maps by using expert knowledge to interpret existing superficial geology 189 \nmaps. 190 \nThe first step is to overlay the eleven Quaternary Domains (see Figure 4) on top of the digital 191 \nSuperficial Deposits Geological Map (the method is scale-independent but for the purposes of a 192 \ntrial it was applied at 1: 625 000 scale).  This allows the origin and thus possible nature of, for 193 \nexample, sandy till in the Scottish Highlands and clayey till mapped in East Anglia to be 194 \nidentified as separate entities.  For each domain there follows a description of the associated 195 \nlandforms, lithological deposits and depositional processes.  This information is developed into a 196 \ndescription of the likely hydrogeological processes pertaining to each domain, and uses case 197 \nstudy information where available to support this analysis. These descriptions serve two 198 \npurposes: they are there to inform users of the methodology about the characteristics of the 199 \ndomains, and they provide background information to assist in classifying lithological units 200 \nwithin each domain. 201 \nThe matrix describes the recharge and attenuation potential for each geological unit in each 202 \ndomain.  This has been done by asking geological experts a series of questions for the deposits in 203 \neach domain (Table 1).  The matrix provides a framework for meaningful and systematic 204 \ndiscussion between hydrogeologists and Quaternary geologists. The lithology of glacial till is 205 \ngoverned across much of Great Britain by the nature of the bedrock.  Glaciers scoured material 206 \nKJG 10of 24 04\/03\/2011 \nfrom bedrock and in general did not move it far before depositing it to form till.  In consequence, 207 \nglacial tills developed on sandstones or coarse crystalline rocks tend to be sandy and permeable, 208 \nwhile those developed on mudstones or strata such as the Coal Measures are clay rich and have 209 \nlow permeability.  The matrix describes whether the lithology of the till within a particular 210 \ndomain largely reflects the bedrock lithology.  If it does, the soil parent map (a simplified 211 \ngeological map based on bedrock lithology) was used to determine recharge potential and 212 \nattenuation. 213 \nTable 1. Framework for discussion between Quaternary geological experts and hydrogeologists 214 \nAssessment of recharge potential has been made largely on the basis of the composition and 215 \ngrain size of the deposits, and the likelihood of encountering continuous low permeability layers. 216 \nFor most of the lithotypes the composition is likely to vary and the assessments have been based 217 \non the relative proportions of the different grades of material.  The recharge potential is based on 218 \nthe perceived permeability of the deposits. Recharge potential assessments were made as High 219 \n(H), Medium (M) or Low (L) and a rationale for the assessments provided. This assessment is 220 \ncarried out twice, both for the majority (primary) situation and for a subordinate (secondary) 221 \nsituation; for example, the primary recharge potential through clayey till is Low but the 222 \nsecondary potential where the till is locally more granular may be Medium.  At this stage the 223 \nfracturing has not been considered \u2013 but a general likelihood of fracturing can be indicated by 224 \nthe thickness of the deposits (see below).  There is no quantification of the amount of recharge 225 \nthat the deposits could transmit, merely an assessment of their relative ability to transmit 226 \ninfiltrating water (recharge) in general.   The method does not take into account other known 227 \nelements of recharge processes such as the effects of runoff from less permeable deposits with 228 \nfocussed recharge around the periphery and does not consider the thickness of the deposit.   229 \nAssessment of the attenuation capacity has been made by estimating the presence of clay 230 \nminerals (as a surrogate for cation exchange capacity) and organic material such as peat. The soil 231 \ncover is not assessed \u2013 just the likely clay and organic material within the superficial deposit.   232 \nKJG 11of 24 04\/03\/2011 \nThe same primary and secondary classification is also made for attenuation potential although 233 \nmany primary and secondary classifications may be the same. Peat, for example, has High 234 \nprimary and High secondary attenuation potential.  In this way the primary classification relates 235 \nto the predominant lithology within each lithotype.  For example, an alluvial deposit may be 236 \npredominantly sand and gravel, but there may also be minor clay layers within that deposit. The 237 \npredominant (primary) attenuation potential is low, however, where clays are present the 238 \n(secondary) attenuation potential is high.  It is, therefore, the interpreted understanding of the 239 \nnature and variability of the superficial geological deposit which generates the assessment of 240 \nrecharge and attenuation potential. 241 \nThickness can be important to recharge and attenuation potential in several ways: very thin 242 \ndeposits may be discontinuous, thinner deposits may be fractured throughout whereas increased 243 \ntravel times through a thicker deposit allow more time for degradation of contaminants.  Rather 244 \nthan including thickness implicitly within the assessment (as part of the rating) it was left to be 245 \nincluded explicitly as a separate layer as required. Five categories were chosen:  246 \n\u2022 Absent, or not sufficiently thick to be mapped. 247 \n\u2022 1 \u2013 3 m \u2013 superficial deposits can be variable or discontinuous, recharge may occur in 248 \nholes within the cover. 249 \n\u2022 3 - 10 m \u2013 tills can be fractured within the upper 10 m, therefore, where the till is less 250 \nthan 10 m thick there is a higher potential for bypass flow with higher recharge potential 251 \nand lower attenuation potential.  252 \n\u2022 10 - 30 m \u2013 fracture and bypass flow can occur but are less likely. 253 \n\u2022 more than 30 m thick.  There is a greater chance of heterogeneity and saturated deposits, 254 \nincluding tills, are likely to behave as aquifers in their own right unless the entire 255 \nsequence is impermeable.  256 \nKJG 12of 24 04\/03\/2011 \nCentral to the methodology is the assignment of glacial till lithologies derived from bedrock 257 \nlithology for various Quaternary Domains. Table 2 shows the attenuation and recharge potential 258 \npredicted for superficial material derived from each of 15 generic bedrock types. A variety of 259 \nbedrock lithologies fall under the Sedimentary Mixed classification and the attenuation and 260 \nrecharge potential properties are variable within this category. The values are amended wherever 261 \nthe properties of the Sedimentary Mixed bedrock are known.  The general rule of underlying 262 \nbedrock directly influencing overlying till properties is not universal, and exceptions are 263 \ncaptured in the matrix, for example, the till cover along parts of the north-east coast of England 264 \nis smeared with low permeability marine clays which reduce the recharge potential from 265 \nMedium to Low.  Other exceptions occur where two ice sheets converge, e.g. the Irish Sea Ice 266 \nand the Welsh Ice meet and interdigitate over central Wales, and a similar situation is present 267 \nover much of East Anglia where one till may overlie another. In these instances, especially 268 \nwhere the till is thick, the younger deposits in the sequence may bear little relationship to the 269 \nunderlying bedrock. 270 \nTable 2 Generic classification of superficial cover based on underlying bedrock lithology (L \u2013 271 \nLow, M \u2013 Medium, H \u2013 High) 272 \nThe rationale for each classification is given in the matrix so that the assessment is transparent.  273 \nRevisions can be made as local users add their knowledge to the matrix. The classifications and 274 \nmaps can mature and evolve as more data are incorporated.  275 \n 276 \nGIS application of the methodology 277 \nThe different geological datasets (superficial deposits, Quaternary Domains and bedrock 278 \ngeology) and the data matrix were integrated to create  1: 625 000 recharge and attenuation 279 \npotential maps using Access\u2122 and ArcGIS\u2122 (version 9.1) (Figure 6). Analyses for Northern 280 \nIreland have not been presented because of the preliminary nature of the domains mapping. The 281 \nshapefile of superficial deposits at 1: 625 000 scale was used as the main layer. Each polygon 282 \nKJG 13of 24 04\/03\/2011 \nwithin this shapefile was attributed with the domain\/sub domain into which it falls (Figure 4). 283 \nWhere the superficial polygon intersected more than one domain it was divided accordingly. The 284 \nresulting polygons were then attributed according to the bedrock classifications, again splitting 285 \nthem if more than one bedrock type was intercepted (Table 2).    286 \nFigure 6 Process diagram of GIS application of the methodology. 287 \nOnce the polygons had been created, recharge and attenuation potential were assigned to each 288 \npolygon based on the classifications given in the matrix table for all the lithotypes within each 289 \ndomain. Modifications were made where local variations had been noted by the geologist in their 290 \nassessment, e.g. to distinguish between low permeability clayey silt and clay \u2018carse\u2019 type beach 291 \ndeposits and more permeable raised beach deposits, both identified only as coastal deposits on 292 \nthe superficial deposits map. The classification for the underlying bedrock type was used (with 293 \nexceptions, where known) where the lithotype was till.  294 \nThe output contains nine categories for both recharge and attenuation potential which show the 295 \nnatural variability displayed by combining the primary and secondary classifications. The nine 296 \nclasses (as primary classification\/secondary classification) for both recharge and attenuation 297 \npotential are: HH, HM, HL, MH, MM, ML, LH, LM and LL.  298 \nEach shape file was converted into a grid or raster file of 1 km2 grid size to provide recharge 299 \npotential (Figure 7) and attenuation (Figure 8). Where two or more classifications occurred 300 \nwithin the 1 km2, a majority rule was applied (i.e. the dominant classification was assigned to the 301 \nwhole grid square). Two grids are available, one for recharge potential and the other for 302 \nattenuation potential.  303 \nFigure 7 Map of recharge potential using 1:625 000 data.  For high recharge potential, more 304 \nwater would be expected to pass through the superficial deposits.  Information on the thickness 305 \nof the deposits is not incorporated. 306 \nKJG 14of 24 04\/03\/2011 \nFigure 8 Map of attenuation potential using 1:625 000 scale data.  For high attenuation, 307 \nnegligible contamination is expected through the superficial deposits.  Information on drift 308 \nthickness is not incorporated. 309 \nOutputs and Validation 310 \nThe national 1: 625 000 scale dataset of superficial deposits was used to provide national 311 \ncoverage, albeit at a coarse scale, enough for proof of method.  The output is at 1 km grid size. 312 \nNow that the methodology has been adopted by the Environment Agency larger scale data are 313 \nbeing used and a more meaningful output derived, however, the results so far are a guide for 314 \ncomparison with existing perceptions of regional recharge and vulnerability of groundwater.  315 \nThe current output should not, therefore, be applied to support specific environmental 316 \njudgements.  The map outputs have been compared with a number of other datasets including 317 \nHOST data (Hydrology of Soil Types), the new groundwater vulnerability screening maps for 318 \nScotland and the results from a number of regional studies on recharge through superficial 319 \ndeposits. One of the best methods for testing the maps is also to compare the assessment of a 320 \nparticular area with the experience and knowledge of local hydrogeologists. 321 \nHOST is a dataset which is based on the 1 x 1 km National Soil Map data together with data 322 \nfrom the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology on the behaviour of river catchments (Boorman et al. 323 \n1995). There are 29 HOST classes, which describe the dominant pathways of water movement 324 \nthrough the soil and substrate. Standard Percentage Runoff (SPR) is given for each HOST soil 325 \nclass. These were used to calculate an estimate of the Standard Percentage Infiltration (SPI) for 326 \neach HOST class (100% - SPR = SPI).   327 \nThe calculation of SPR is based on the analysis of flood event data, i.e. collated river flow and 328 \nrainfall data for storm events. SPR is the percentage of rainfall that causes a short term increase 329 \nin river flow at the catchment outlet and, therefore, the SPI is not directly comparable with 330 \ninfiltration. Nonetheless the SPI map provides an indication of the general response of different 331 \ncatchments to rainfall. In general there is a broad agreement between the datasets, but areas of 332 \nKJG 15of 24 04\/03\/2011 \ntill which have Sedimentary Mixed bedrock parent material offer a poor match suggesting that 333 \nadditional local knowledge input is desirable. 334 \nFigure 9 shows the results of the statistical comparison with the HOST data for SPI. There is 335 \nbroad agreement i.e. areas with lower percentage SPI have a greater proportion of superficial 336 \ncover assigned as low recharge potential while those with higher percentage SPI have a greater 337 \nproportion of high recharge potential superficial cover.  338 \nFigure 9 Plot of recharge potential against the HOST Standard Infiltration potential. 339 \nThe recharge and attenuation potential maps were also compared with the vulnerability screening 340 \nmaps of superficial deposits determined for Scotland (\u00d3 Dochartaigh et al. 2005). The map of 341 \nattenuation potential shows a similar pattern to the Scottish vulnerability screening map for the 342 \nsuperficial deposits \u2013 low and medium values are prevalent over much of Scotland except where 343 \npeat or other clay\/organic rich materials occur. There is particularly good agreement with the 344 \nlower vulnerability rating.  There is also good agreement between the recharge potential map and 345 \nthe superficial aquifer productivity maps generated for Scotland using pumping test data, HOST 346 \ndata and expert knowledge (MacDonald et al. 2005). 347 \nThe maps have also been examined against more detailed recharge studies reported in the 348 \nliterature. For example, the East Anglian Till is known to permit little recharge to the underlying 349 \nChalk, particularly in interfluve locations (Marks et al. 2004). Till has a significant impact on 350 \nrecharge quantity and distribution to the underlying Chalk aquifer. Beneath the interfluves 351 \nrecharge appears to be lower than previous estimates of 20 \u2013 40 mm a-1 (Soley and Heathcote, 352 \n1998), maybe as low as 5 mm a-1 (Marks et al. 2004). The recharge potential map (Figure 7) 353 \nshows that the Low Medium recharge potential classification is consistent with these studies.  354 \nSimilarly in the Cheshire Basin, recharge to the unconfined Sherwood Sandstone aquifer has 355 \nbeen estimated at approximately 350 mm a-1, but where till cover is present, recharge to the 356 \nunderlying aquifer is only about 52 mm a-1 (Vines 1984). These variations are reflected by 357 \nKJG 16of 24 04\/03\/2011 \nrecharge potential classifications for the till covered areas of LM and LL and for the areas where 358 \ntill is absent recharge potential is classed as HM.    359 \nInitial testing of the output data layers against national nitrate concentrations in groundwater for 360 \nEngland and Wales (Johnson 2006) shows that the GIS output reflects the expected influence of 361 \npoorly permeable superficial deposits on nitrate fate and transport. However, the correlation is 362 \nweak in some places largely due to insufficient local detail.  363 \nThe nitrate comparison indicated that key properties of the poorly permeable superficial deposits 364 \nthat are required to predict nitrate concentration in groundwater are the overall coverage of the 365 \ncover material (expressed as percentage cover per km2) and its thickness, e.g. >10 m superficial 366 \ncover, both of which are available as digital datasets held by BGS. The importance of these 367 \nparameters varies according to the domain under consideration, e.g. depth of superficial deposits 368 \nis more important for the Till Dominant than for the Dissected Till domain. It is likely that both 369 \nthese parameters need to be incorporated into the matrix if the characterisation of superficial 370 \ndeposits is to be improved significantly. 371 \n 372 \nDiscussion 373 \nThe methodology enables rapid assessment of the hydrogeological properties of superficial 374 \ndeposits on a national\/regional scale. Use of the 1: 625 000 scale datasets provides a broad 375 \noverview that is sufficient for proof of method. Now that the methodology is established it is 376 \nintended that it should be applied to more detailed data. It is also intended that input of local 377 \nknowledge will be invaluable for assessing the success of the methodology and improving the 378 \nresultant maps where anomalies or shortfalls exist.   379 \nInevitably there are a number of constraints imposed by the methodology.  These include scale 380 \nissues and use of classifications at 1: 625 000 scale which inevitably simplifies otherwise 381 \nheterogeneous systems. However, the heterogeneity is captured by the primary and secondary 382 \nestimates of recharge and attenuation potential, i.e. a highly variable 3D deposit is classed as HL, 383 \nKJG 17of 24 04\/03\/2011 \nwhile homogenous deposits may be HH.  In addition it has only been possible to capture some of 384 \nthe available three dimensional data in the matrix, for example, for the areas of thick superficial 385 \ndeposits in the Cheshire Basin.  Application at a larger scale will enable the characterisation of 386 \nthe 3D data in more detail.   387 \nThere are also mapping issues, for example, some areas of raised beach\/estuarine deposits, 388 \nparticularly around the Wash, have been mapped as alluvium on the 1: 625 000 superficial 389 \ngeology map.  For many areas moraine and till have not been subdivided and variations in the 390 \nmorphology and composition of these deposits have implications for permeability and 391 \nattenuation potential. The matrix methodology is helpful here, since explanations can be made in 392 \nthe matrix by local experts so that these mapping issues can be overcome by adjusting 393 \nclassifications manually. 394 \nThere is also the question of whether there are enough assessment categories. For some deposits 395 \na highly variable category may be more appropriate than a fixed descriptor. There is also an 396 \nargument that thickness should be integrated into the classifications rather than examined as a 397 \nseparate dataset.  These issues can be addressed readily in subsequent usage, given that the 398 \ndatabase can be modified easily.  399 \nThe coarse scale used in the trial does not allow recharge and attenuation properties to be 400 \nassessed confidently at local, or even small catchment scale. However, the methodology is 401 \nessentially scale independent, and can be readily adapted to apply the most commonly used 402 \ngeological dataset at 1: 50 000 scale, although it should be considered that the quality and precise 403 \ntype of mapping varies from one area to another at that scale.   404 \nThe methodology represents a means of capturing existing and developing geological knowledge 405 \nand extracting relevant elements to improve conceptual hydrogeological understanding.  The 406 \nimportance of this interaction between hydrogeologists and mapping geologists who have an 407 \nextensive understanding of the nature and variability of superficial deposits in a particular area 408 \ncannot be over-estimated. Further development of the associated GIS and incorporation of more 409 \nKJG 18of 24 04\/03\/2011 \ndetailed data will allow application at local catchment\/groundwater body scale. In addition, the 410 \nGIS could be used as an ongoing archive of local understanding and knowledge, the layers and 411 \ndatasets developed complementing and enhancing existing vulnerability maps and water 412 \nresource models. 413 \nAlthough there are a number of additional datasets available, outputs need to be evaluated before 414 \nthey are formally incorporated into the assessment procedure. The initial testing provides a 415 \nbaseline from which to judge the relative improvement in outputs due to the inclusion of any 416 \nnew dataset into the method. New data sets could include: soils data, land drainage data, rock 417 \nhead elevation, nitrate monitoring and loading data, and seasonal variability of loading.   418 \n 419 \nConclusions  420 \nSuperficial deposits have been evaluated using Quaternary domain classifications to provide 421 \nimproved geological and hydrogeological characterisation. Geological and hydrogeological data 422 \nhave been integrated with expert local geological and hydrogeological knowledge using a data 423 \nmatrix to provide improved assessment of the impact of superficial deposits on groundwater 424 \nvulnerability. New groundwater vulnerability maps of recharge potential and attenuation 425 \npotential within superficial cover material over bedrock aquifers have been developed at 426 \n1:625 000 scale.  427 \nA qualitative assessment of the results compares favourably with existing recharge studies and 428 \nregional hydrogeological knowledge.  Favourable comparison with data from HOST provides a 429 \nquantitative assessment of the method.   The methodology excludes direct consideration of the 430 \nsoil zone and other intrinsic processes which are encapsulated in recharge estimation and in the 431 \nassessment of attenuation potential of the vadose zone.  These exclusions do not impact on the 432 \nassessment for the superficial strata and the output is consistently robust. 433 \nAs the methodology is scale independent it is recommended that it is applied at 1: 50 000 scale 434 \nsubject to data licensing issues. This will enable more detailed characterisation and assessment 435 \nKJG 19of 24 04\/03\/2011 \nof groundwater vulnerability at a local level. Rescaling will also provide an opportunity to add 436 \nadditional components to the methodology as required. 437 \nAlthough the method is constrained by the availability of data and local knowledge, one of its 438 \nstrengths is that it allows new information to be incorporated at a later date so that assessments 439 \nare improved and validated. This will enable a flexible, holistic and dynamic approach to 440 \ngroundwater vulnerability assessments and ensure that they are based on the best available 441 \ninformation.  The methodology is currently being trialled by the Environment Agency. 442 \n 443 \nAcknowledgements 444 \nThe work described in this paper was funded by SNIFFER, Edinburgh on behalf of the 445 \nEnvironment Agency, Scottish Environment Protection Agency and Environment & Heritage 446 \nService, Northern Ireland (now Northern Ireland Environment Agency).

Secondary \nfeatures, such as the presence of \nfractures can also increase recharge \npotential.\nActual bedrock recharge depends partly \non the properties of the bedrock. If the \nbedrock has low permeability and\/or \nlow storage, and cannot physically \naccept all the recharge, excess recharge \nmay flow horizontally through the \nsuperficial deposits.\nEffective Rainfall Attenuation\nMuch of the attenuation of contami-\nnants occurs within the soil. In this \nbiologically active zone contaminants \ncan be subject to a range of chemical \nreactions, sorbed onto clays, or taken \nup by organic material.\nContaminants can be attenuated in the \nsuperficial deposits, by the presence of \nclay or organic material. The travel time \nis also important as this will give more \ntime for attenuation to occur.\nSome attenuation of contaminants can \noccur, but within the bedrock, dilution is \ngenerally the most significant factor. \nRunoffSoil\nRecharge\nSuperficial \ndeposits\nRecharge\nSuperficial \ngroundwater\nBedrock\nBedrock\nrecharge\nSuperficial Geology\n1:625 000\nAlluvium\nBlown sand\nBrickearth\nClay-with-flints\nCrag group\nDrift geology not \nmapped\nLacustrine deposits\nLandslip\nPeat\nRaised marine \ndeposits\nRiver terrace \ndeposits\nSand and gravel\nTill\n000 100 200 300 400 500 600 700\n1200\n1100\n1000\n900\n800\n700\n600\n500\n400\n300\n200\n100\n000\nN\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\n800\n900\n1000\n1100\n1200\n000 100 200 300 400 500 600 700\nCoastal and estuarine \nDomain\nDissected till domain\nFluvial domain\nIce-scoured montane \nDomain\nLowland basin \nDomain\nLowland periglaciated \nDomain\nMinimal till domain\nMontane and valley \nDomain\nPlateau and valley \ndomain\nTill dominant domain\nUpland periglaciated \ndomain\nQuaternary DomainsN\nSuperficial Deposits\nGeological Map\nUK Quaternary\nDomains Map\nThe Matrix\nUK Soil Parent Map\n(as appropriate)\nRecharge Potential Map\nMap showing how easily \ngroundwater can flow \nvertically through the \nsuperficial deposits, based \non permeability and \nheterogeneity.
