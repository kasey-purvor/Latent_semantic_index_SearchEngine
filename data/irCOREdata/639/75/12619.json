INTRODUCTION\nApplication of two-dimensional (2D) hydraulic models to rural\n\ufb02oodplains is now relatively well understood as a result of\nnumerous model applications over the last two decades (see for\nexample, Refs 1\u20136). Benchmarking of 2D models applied to rural\n\ufb02oodplains (e.g. Bates and De Roo7 and Horritt and Bates8) has\nalso yielded insights into the level of physical and topographic\nrepresentation required to simulate \ufb02ow characteristics at\ndifferent scales, the impact of different numerical solution\nschemes on the results obtained and the physical realism of\nmodel parameters in different model types. A similar process\nhas yet to be undertaken for urban \ufb02oodplains as applications\nhave, until very recently, been prevented by a lack of high-\nresolution data to characterise complex urban topography and\ntopology, and insuf\ufb01cient model ef\ufb01ciency to attempt urban\n\ufb02ooding simulations on meaningful scales. Resolving surface\nwater movement through urban areas requires resolution of\ncomplex \ufb02ow paths around buildings, representation of micro-\nscale topographic and blockage effects (e.g. kerbs and walls9)\nand numerical schemes capable of dealing with high-velocity\n\ufb02ow at shallow depth. This requires model grids of the order of\n1\u20135m resolution to capture the relevant topographic features.10\nIt is thus no surprise that hydraulic modellers have concentrated\non the simpler rural case. However, in order to undertake\ncomprehensive \ufb02ood risk management, there is a need to\ndevelop a capability to model urban areas as this is where the\nmajority of at-risk assets are located.\nOver the past decade a number of studies have documented the\napplication of 2D hydraulic models to complex urban problems,\nincluding numerical solutions of the full 2D shallow-water\nequations,11\u201314 2D diffusion wave models,15\u201317 analytical\napproximations to the 2D diffusion wave equations using uniform\n\ufb02ow formulae18 and grid-based geomorphological routing\nmodels.19 Moreover, the work presented in this paper builds on a\nrich heritage of 1D and GIS-based hydraulic modelling of urban\nareas (for a review see Smith20), often involving linked surface\nwater\u2013sewer \ufb02ow models.\nDespite this proliferation of 2D hydraulic models applied to urban\nareas, understanding of the relative merits of different approaches\nis still limited (the study of Leopardi et al.21 is an exception).\nSingle model applications to sparse validation data con\ufb01rm that\nsuch applications are indeed possible and identify the\nmethodological constraints that need to be resolved to make such\nsimulations happen, but do not tell us anything about the trade-\noffs between physical realism and code ef\ufb01ciency or the relative\nmerits of various numerical solution techniques. Moreover, to\nmake such comparisons meaningful requires that codes are\nconsidered within a framework that accounts for realistic\nuncertainties over topographic error and the fact that almost all\nhydraulic models require calibration, which may compensate for\nWater Management 161 Issue WM1 Benchmarking 2D hydraulic models for urban \ufb02ooding Hunter et al. 13\ndata and model errors. This is the primary focus of this paper.\nThe performance of six 2D hydraulic models (TUFLOW, DIVAST,\nDIVAST-TVD, TRENT, JFLOW and LISFLOOD-FP) has been\ncompared, at high resolution, to simulate surface \ufb02ooding of a\nsmall urban catchment in Glasgow, Scotland, UK. The codes\nrepresent a wide spectrum of fundamental equations, numerical\ntechniques and time step control methods. The codes are \ufb01rst\ncompared in terms of their relative performance and response to\ntypical topographic error for a single set of roughness parameters\nfor this test site. A sensitivity analysis was then undertaken to\ndetermine whether differences between the models can be\ncompensated for by calibration using physically realistic\nparameter values. In this way the aim is to determine whether\nuncertainty is reduced most effectively by re\ufb01ning the\ntopographic representation, improving the model physical basis or\nby collecting detailed hydrometric data to better constrain the\nmodel calibration process. A further goal of this work is to\ndetermine whether the performance differences caused by the use\nof different numerical solution techniques are more or less\nimportant than uncertainties introduced by the model calibration\nprocess.\n2. MODELLING APPROACHES\nThe models selected for use in this paper were chosen to represent\nmost of the main classes of 2D codes that could be applied to\nurban hydraulic modelling problems. The models are\n(a) implicit \ufb01nite-difference solutions of the full 2D shallow-\nwater equations (TUFLOW22 and the original DIVAST code,23\nboth of which use an alternating direction implicit (ADI)\nsolver)\n(b) explicit \ufb01nite-difference solutions of the full 2D shallow-\nwater equations (DIVAST-TVD,24,25 which uses a total\nvariation diminishing (TVD) solver)\n(c) explicit \ufb01nite-volume solutions of the full 2D shallow-water\nequations (TRENT,26 which uses a Roe Riemann solver)\n(d) explicit \ufb01nite-difference solutions of the 2D diffusion wave\nequations (JFLOW27)\n(e) explicit analytical approximations to the 2D diffusion wave\nequations (LISFLOOD-FP28).\nThe codes are fully described in the references cited; Table 1 brie\ufb02y\nsummarises the characteristics pertinent to the present discussion.\nThe benchmarking process begins with structured grid models\nonly, as this allows easily control of grid resolution effects in the\nnumerical experiments that follow. A consequence of this is that\nunstructured \ufb01nite-element and \ufb01nite-volume methods have been\nomitted from the comparison at this stage.\nEssentially, each code represents a different trade-off between\nphysical representation and potential computational cost based\non the developers\u2019 assumptions about those \ufb02ow features that\nbecome critical in particular situations.

Main characteristics of the six codes used in the benchmark test\n14 Water Management 161 Issue WM1 Benchmarking 2D hydraulic models for urban \ufb02ooding Hunter et al.\n(TRENT and DIVAST-TVD) use more complex numerical\nsolution schemes to allow shock capturing, while others\n(LISFLOOD-FP, JFLOW) sidestep this problem by solving\nequations that cannot represent such hydraulic transients (and\nindeed actively smooth them out). Some are implicit (TUFLOW,\nDIVAST), while others are explicit (JFLOW, LISFLOOD-FP,\nTRENT and DIVAST-TVD) and therefore require careful time\nstep control to maintain stability. Given that very little is\nknown about the likely importance of speci\ufb01c \ufb02ow mechanisms\nin urban settings or model ef\ufb01ciency in simulating these, all the\nabove codes are potentially adequate for the problem in hand.\nIn addition, by building replication into the research design of\nthe numerical experiments, it should be possible to trace\nconsistent behaviours exhibited by particular groups of codes to\ntheir speci\ufb01c common features.\n3. STUDY SITE AND DATA AVAILABILITY\nThe models were applied to a small urban catchment within the\ncity of Glasgow, Scotland, UK, which has \ufb02ooded in the recent\npast. The domain to be modelled comprises a rectangle\n1.0 km\u0002 0.4 km, with dense urban development either side of\ntwo main streets and a topologically complex network of minor\nroads. The area is a mix of some steep sections of road and local\ndepressions where water may pond. To characterise the\ntopography and topology for this study site, a 1m resolution\nairborne laser altimetry (LiDAR) survey was undertaken by\nInfoterra Ltd. This was then fused with Ordnance Survey (OS)\nMastermap1 digital map data that de\ufb01ned building locations,\nthe road network and land-use type as vector layers. The LiDAR\ndata acquired for this study had already been \ufb01ltered by\nInfoterra to remove vegetation and building features, using their\nstandard processing algorithms, to leave a \u2018bare earth\u2019 digital\nelevation model (DEM) with horizontal and vertical accuracies\nless than 50 cm and 15 cm root mean square error (RMSE)\nrespectively. For hydraulic modelling the \u2018bare earth\u2019 LiDAR\ndata were aggregated to 2m and buildings, kerbs and roads\nwere all reinserted, based on their locations in the digital map\nlayer. To reinsert the buildings, all cells in the 2m DEM that fell\ninside a building vector de\ufb01ned by the OS Mastermap1 data\nwere raised in elevation by either 12m (for apartment blocks) or\n6m (for small houses) to represent building height. The precise\nheight value is unimportant here as \ufb02ow depths during all\nsimulations were always <1m and the purpose of this\nprocessing step is to allow buildings to be represented as\n\u2018islands\u2019 that water must \ufb02ow around. Roads and kerbs were\ninserted in a similar way, assuming a uniform kerb height of\n10 cm and with the road camber based on analysis of the 1m\nLiDAR and observations at the study site. The result is a high-\nresolution DEM (hereafter termed the benchmark DEM) with\nrealistic representation of urban morphologic features. While the\nbenchmark DEM does not represent actual \u2018ground truth\u2019, it\ndoes, unlike raw LiDAR data, represent urban features as\nsmoothly varying surfaces and can be degraded in a controlled\nway to study the impact of terrain data errors on model\npredictions. Fig.1 shows the road and building layout at this\nstudy site with the surface height (z) from the benchmark DEM\nshown as a grey scale overlain by water depths (h) from the end\nof a typical model simulation to give an indication of the \ufb02ow\ncomplexity and areas of ponding.\nFlooding at this site is caused, at least in part, by a small (\u00041m\nwide) stream that enters near the north-east corner of the domain\nand almost immediately enters a culvert (located at point X0 in\nFig. 1) that runs under the entire site. Flooding has been observed\nto occur here as a result of \ufb02ow exceeding the capacity of the\nculvert and spilling into the street network at point X0. The\ncatchment area upstream of X0 is small (<5 km2) and the stream\nresponds very rapidly to heavy rainfall, with typical \ufb02ooding\nevents being less than 1 h duration. Once the capacity of the\nculvert is exceeded, the model simulation shown in Fig. 1 clearly\nsuggests that \ufb02ow diverges, with water moving along the two\nmain east\u2013west oriented streets before converging and ponding in\nlow-lying areas in the southern part of the domain at location X3.\nThis result is fully consistent with eyewitness accounts and\ncontemporaneous photographs of \ufb02ooding at this site.

The domain complexity and\nrequirement to simulate both high-velocity low-depth \ufb02ow on\nsteep slopes, of low roughness and depression ponding is therefore\na rigorous test of hydraulic model ability and is typical of many\nurban \ufb02ooding situations.\nThe \ufb02ow event simulated in this analysis is based on a real\n\ufb02ood that occurred at this site on 30 July 2002. The in\ufb02ow\nboundary condition for each model consists of the hydrograph\nshown in Fig. 2, which is imposed as a point source internal to\nthe model domain at location X0. This hydrograph represents\nthe water volume over\ufb02owing the culvert and re\ufb02ects the\nauthors\u2019 best interpretation of available eyewitness accounts\nand historical photography. Key features typical of many urban\n\ufb02oods are the very rapid hydrograph rise and fall, and the\nability for small catchments to generate relatively high peak\n\ufb02ow rates as a result of the high percentage of impervious\nsurfaces. The \ufb02ood event lasts <60min, but each simulation\nwas continued for 120min to allow water to come to rest and\npond in depressions. This then allows a sensible value for mass\nconservation to be calculated for each code. After 120min the\nhydraulic part of the event is effectively over and water levels\nhave ceased to change signi\ufb01cantly, although a considerable\nvolume of water remains in the model domain. Observations at\nthis site show that this ponded water takes some considerable\ntime to drain from the catchment through the stormwater\ndrainage system. All external boundaries for each model were\nclosed with zero mass \ufb02ux. This is a reasonable assumption as,\nin this application, any \ufb02ow that does manage to reach the\nboundary is only 1\u20132 cm deep and \ufb02owing as a shallow sheet.\nMass \ufb02ux across the external boundary is therefore negligible\nand can be safely ignored for the sake of better consistency\nbetween models.\n4. METHODOLOGY\nEach model was initially set up to use the 2m resolution\nbenchmark DEM and the point source hydrograph shown in Fig.\n2. Given the variety of spatial discretisations used, a \ufb01rst\nproblem was to ensure that assimilation of the benchmark DEM\ninto each model led to an identical representation of the site\nterrain. This is not straightforward as, even though the analysis\nis limited to structured grids, the selected models de\ufb01ne the\nterrain at different locations (centre, side mid-points, etc.) on\neach grid cell. The task is also complicated by the fact that a\nnumber of models use intermediate data formats prior to\nassimilating the DEM data or have different spatial interpolation\nschemes. A correct solution to this problem was eventually\nfound, which was tested by checking that each model had an\nidentical surface level at a number of points in the domain.\nIdentical spatially distributed friction coef\ufb01cients were speci\ufb01ed\nfor each model that discriminated between two land-use\nclasses\u2014nveg for all vegetated areas and nroads for tarmac areas\u2014\ndetermined from the OS Mastermap1 data. Lastly, the time step\nwas speci\ufb01ed individually for each model. Table 1 shows the\nwide variety of approaches to time step control taken by the\nmodels used in this benchmark testing to ensure stability,\ncomputational ef\ufb01ciency or an oscillation-free solution (or\ntrade-off between these) for particular numerical solution\nschemes. Given that the purpose of this research was to produce\na rigorous benchmark test, it would have unfairly advantaged\nparticular codes to have been more proscriptive about the time\nstep to be used.\nAs noted in section 1, the benchmark analysis consisted of two\nparts. In part 1, the codes were compared in terms of their relative\nperformance and response to typical topographic error for a single\nset of roughness parameters for this test site. In part 2, a sensitivity\nanalysis study was undertaken to determine whether these\ndifferences between models can be compensated for by\ncalibration, using physically realistic parameter values.\nFor the part 1 analysis, a second DEM (hereafter termed the\nLiDAR DEM) was generated by degrading the benchmark DEM\nthrough the addition of horizontal and vertical errors typical of\nairborne LiDAR data. Total LiDAR positioning errors (horizontal\nerror of \u000450 cm RMSE, vertical error of \u000415 cm RMSE) divide\ninto systematic and random components, with the former\ntypically being dominant. Of these we here assume that the\nsystematic error would be the same between different DEMs and\ncan also be compensated for absolutely in any modelling study\nwith a uniform offset derived from a contemporaneous ground\ntruth campaign. We therefore degraded the benchmark DEM\nusing typical values for the LiDAR random error component\nonly. Based on values reported in the literature,29,30 these were\nestimated as 5 cm RMSE for the vertical error and 15 cm for the\nhorizontal error.\nFor the purpose of this analysis it is assumed that the benchmark\nDEM is an error-free representation of the site terrain and this is\nused as a control to determine the response of each model to\ntypical errors in topographic data. To achieve this, the event\nshown in Fig. 2 was simulated for models constructed with the\nbenchmark and LiDAR DEMs using a single set of friction\ncoef\ufb01cients (nveg\u00bc 0.05 and nroads\u00bc 0.015). The total mass\nbalance error over the whole simulation is reported for each model\nin Table 1 and was found to be a maximum of 1.13% of the in\ufb02ow\nhydrograph volume. Even if this mass error were to occur\ninstantaneously in a single time step, when spread over the whole\n\ufb02ooded area at peak inundation this is equivalent to a height error\nof only 3.5mm. This is insuf\ufb01cient to generate signi\ufb01cant\ndifferences between models for the purposes of this comparison.\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\nD\nis\nch\nar\nge\n: m\n3 \/s\nt: min\n0 15 30 45 60 75 90 105 120\nFig. 2. Event hydrograph simulated in the benchmark tests. The\nvertical dashed lines at 30 and 60 min represent instances for\nwhich model results are presented in later \ufb01gures\n16 Water Management 161 Issue WM1 Benchmarking 2D hydraulic models for urban \ufb02ooding Hunter et al.\nThe part 1 analysis also showed that models based on the 2D\ndiffusion wave incurred a higher computational overhead than\nthose based on the full shallow-water equations for the 2m\nresolution grid used. All the shallow-water model simulations\ntook approximately 1 h to complete (given differences between\ncompilers and computer architectures used for the tests), while the\ndiffusion wave codes took several times longer. This is perhaps\nsurprising as the diffusion wave models solve simpler \ufb02ow\nequations or even, in the case of LISFLOOD-FP, do not use a\nnumerical approach at all. This reverses the typical trend found for\nlarger grid sizes where the computational advantages of using\nexplicit diffusion wave codes are signi\ufb01cant. This is explained by\nthe analysis of Hunter et al.28 who show that the optimal time step\nto maintain stability in an explicit diffusion wave hydraulic model\nis a quadratic function of grid size. Hence for the 2m grid used\nhere, very small time steps are required to ensure stability with\nJFLOW and LISFLOOD-FP and this increases the computational\nburden. This increase in runtime does not occur for the explicit\nTRENT and DIVAST-TVD codes, suggesting that computational\ncost can be signi\ufb01cantly reduced for grids of this scale by\nincluding inertial terms in the controlling equations. Without\nthese terms, inter-cell \ufb02uxes on the \ufb02oodplain can become\nunrealistically large and lead to \u2018checkerboard\u2019-like oscillations\nunless careful time step control is employed. This is a particular\nproblem in areas of deep slow-moving \ufb02ow with a low free surface\ngradient.28 Here we might expect the inclusion of inertial effects\nto signi\ufb01cantly reduce \ufb02ow velocities and inter-cell \ufb02uxes, thus\nallowing higher time steps to be employed. This explains the\nincrease in computational cost for the explicit diffusion wave\nmodels. Research is now ongoing to address this issue with\ndiffusion wave models applied to very \ufb01ne grids; this will be\nreported in a future paper. Despite this increased cost, an\nadvantage of the formulations used in JFLOW and LISFLOOD-FP\nis that they are inherently mass conservative. This is re\ufb02ected in\nthe fact that mass balance errors for these codes are orders of\nmagnitude lower than for the more complex numerical schemes\nused in the full shallow-water models. While we argue above that\nthese larger mass balance errors are unimportant for this\napplication, this may not always be the case.\nFor the part 2 analysis, an ensemble of 13 simulations was run for\neach model on the LiDAR DEM using different pairs of roughness\ncoef\ufb01cients chosen from a wide but physically plausible range to\nmimic the effect of typical calibration procedures. Parameters nveg\nand nroads were simultaneously varied: nveg in the range 0.015\n(bare earth) to 0.075 (dense tall grass and shrubs) in steps of 0.005\nand nroads in the range 0.008\u20130.02 in steps of 0.001. The pairs of\nroughness coef\ufb01cients used and their associated simulation\nnumbers are shown in Table 2. While this is not a large number of\nsimulations compared to previous Monte Carlo analysis of\nhydraulic model sensitivity to friction speci\ufb01cation (see, for\nexample, Aronica et al.31) and does not account for any parameter\nindependence or non-linearity, it should be suf\ufb01cient to determine\nthe range and distribution of model response. In turn this will\nallow determination of whether calibration can compensate for\nany differences between models with different physics or\nnumerical solutions.\n5. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nFor the part 1 analysis, the time series of water heights predicted\nby each model for each DEM at the four points denoted X1, X2, X3\nand X4 in Fig. 1 were compared. These data are shown in Fig. 3.\nPoints X1\u2013X4 were chosen from a much larger set to represent the\nspread of typical hydraulic conditions occurring in the domain\nand to simplify presentation of the results. Hence, point X1\nrepresents an area where water rapidly accumulates at the start of\nthe simulation and then slowly releases as the simulation\nproceeds. Point X2 represents a zone of shallow, high-velocity\n\ufb02ow in the middle of a road section that receives water from a\nsingle direction (east) and over which the complete \ufb02ood wave\npasses during the simulation. Point X3 represents an area of\npermanent ponding by the end of the simulation, while point X4\nrepresents an area of convergent \ufb02ow on the road network as it\nreceives water from both north and south directions. Each of these\nsituations thus provides a stringent test for the hydraulic models\nand allows a rigorous comparison of performance.\nSeveral points emerge from consideration of these data. First,\nalthough the results show remarkable similarity, there are some\nconsistent differences between the models tested. For example, the\nLISFLOOD-FP code always predicts the earliest arrival of the \ufb02ood\nwave at each point, while the TRENT code always predicts it\narriving last. These timing differences are only of the order of 3\u2013\n4min but, given the short duration of this event (dynamic effects\nhave largely ceased after \u000460min into the simulation), this may\nbe signi\ufb01cant. Other codes fall between these extremes and show a\nmore varied pattern with, for example, the JFLOW code behaving\nmore like LISFLOOD-FP at point X1 and more like TRENT at point\nX4. In addition, a further general pattern is that the slower the\npredicted wave propagation speed the lower the predicted water\ndepth at any given time during the simulation. An exception to\nthis is the DIVAST code, which typically predicts the \ufb02ood wave\narriving relatively late, but then rises to a high peak depth before\ndeclining to a low \ufb01nal value. While these results imply\nsigni\ufb01cant mass balance differences between the codes, Table 1\nshows that this is not the case. Moreover, these behaviours do not\nseem to follow any obvious pattern related to particular features\nshared by groups of codes, and may be due to the way in which\neither the friction term, the transition to and treatment of\nsupercritical \ufb02ow or viscosity is handled by each code.\nDifferences in maximum simulated water depth (h) for the\nbenchmark DEM are minimal for point X1, up to\u0004 8 cm at X3 and\nup to\u000410 cm at X2 and X4. This is of the same order as the typical\nrandom component of LiDAR data vertical error (\u00045 cm RMSE),\nSimulation No. nveg nroads\n1 0.015 0.008\n2 0.020 0.009\n3 0.025 0.010\n4 0.030 0.011\n5 0.035 0.012\n6 0.040 0.013\n7 0.045 0.014\n8 0.050 0.015\n9 0.055 0.016\n10 0.060 0.017\n11 0.065 0.018\n12 0.070 0.019\n13 0.075 0.020\nTable 2.

For the\nLiDAR DEM the absolute ground surface (z) errors compared to the\nbenchmark DEM at points X1\u2013X4 are \u00030.02, \u00030.02, 0.03 and\n0.0 cm respectively, and these differences are re\ufb02ected in the\ndifferent water depths predicted at X1\u2013X4 in these simulations.\nIf anything, the range of results obtained is slightly narrower\nwhen using the LiDAR DEM ((b), (d), (f ) and (h) in Fig. 3) and this\nimplies, perhaps unsurprisingly, that degrading terrain data with\nrandom noise of the same order as that contained in LiDAR data\ndoes not affect the simulated \ufb02ood wave propagation. LiDAR data\ntherefore seem to be a good choice for urban \ufb02ood modelling,\neven at 2 m horizontal resolution.\nIt is also clear that certain numerical solution schemes are prone to\nsmall (<1 cm) oscillations at shallow \ufb02ow depths, especially on\nthe hydrograph falling limb. These can be observed for the\nDIVAST code at points X2 and X4 and TUFLOW at point X4 on the\nLiDAR DEM after 50min of simulation time. In addition, for\nTUFLOW, noticeable spikes in predicted water depth occur at point\nX2: one at 20min into the simulation for the benchmark DEM and\ntwo at 20 and 55min into the simulation for the LiDAR DEM.\nHowever, it is not clear whether these are physical effects or the\nresult of a numerical instability. The presence of oscillations on\nthe falling limb can be explained by the occurrence of grid scale\noscillations, which arise due to the numerical treatment of\nadvective acceleration terms. This effect can be overcome either\nby using upwind difference schemes (potentially leading to high\nlevels of arti\ufb01cial diffusion) or by using higher-order accurate\nschemes (which can be computationally expensive and more\ncomplex in terms of treating boundaries). Either solution may be\nproblematic for modelling \ufb02ows in urban environments. Despite\nthis, both TUFLOW and DIVAST capture the general pattern of\n\ufb02ow variation at these locations without the computational\nexpense of a more complex numerical technique. The JFLOW and\nLISFLOOD-FP codes, which are based on the diffusion wave\nequation and do not include the advective accelerations that lead\nto grid scale oscillations, produce solutions rather similar to the\nfull shock capturing code. This implies that, while the numerical\nshocks may be dif\ufb01cult to simulate, they may not be important to\noverall \ufb02ow development at these points.\nAn alternative way of visualising these results is to look at the\nmaximum inundation extent vector predicted by each model.\nThese are shown in Fig. 4 and suggest that the differences between\nmodels implied by Fig. 3 translate into numerous localised\ndifferences in extent predictions, especially in areas of low slope\nwith very shallow \ufb02ow (h < 5 cm). Where this occurs, such as in\nthe central portion of the domain around coordinates [500, 200]\nand in the north-west corner, all codes predict rather fragmented\narrangements of wet and dry areas. This is likely to result from a\ncombination of local micro-topography and the particular\ncharacteristics of the numerical solver used. In particular, small\nnumerical oscillations may have a large relative effect at very\nshallow \ufb02ow depths resulting in a more fragmented pattern of\ninundation. However, these differences are rather minor in\nabsolute terms and occur in areas with water depths less than the\ntypical LiDAR data random vertical error. It could therefore be\nargued that any predictions of very shallow \ufb02ow are unreliable\nand can be ignored unless they can be shown to affect the \ufb02ow\npropagation.\nIn general, TRENT predicts a wider extent of inundation than the\nother codes, although maximum differences in shoreline location\nare only of the order of 30\u201340m (e.g. at coordinates [820, 250]).\nWhile small, these differences explain the implied mass balance\ndiscrepancy between the codes suggested by the at-a-point time\nseries shown in Fig. 3, whereby for the TRENT code a similar\nvolume of water is spread over a wider area. Similar, but less\nreadily discernible, effects happen with the other codes and this in\nturn means that the water surface slopes simulated by the codes\nare subtly different, and are both non-zero and different from the\nunderlying topographic slope. This also supports the conclusion\nthat minor differences in the dynamic behaviour of the codes may\nbe due to the way that friction, supercritical \ufb02ow transitions or\nviscosity effects are handled.\nLastly, both codes based on the diffusion wave equation\n(JFLOW and LISFLOOD-FP) show the westward propagation of\nthe \ufb02ood wave terminating in an almost identical pattern around\ncoordinates [150, 250]. The full shallow-water codes predict that\ninundation continues into the region x < 150 where it crosses a\n\ufb02at and non-built-up area before, in certain cases, reconnecting\nwith the road network in the top north-west corner of the domain.\nThe most likely explanation for this is that connectivity between\nthe main \ufb02ow domain and the area x < 150 is a result of inertial\n\ufb02ow effects that are only represented in the full shallow-water\nmodels. Essentially it appears that \ufb02ow \u2018shoots\u2019 along the steep\nand straight east\u2013west oriented road in the upper portion of the\ncatchment. By the time \ufb02ow reaches x \u00bc 150m it has suf\ufb01cient\nmomentum to overtop bounding topography and continue on into\nthe \ufb02at area beyond. Examination of water depths at\nx \u00bc \u00bd150; 250\u0005 shows the diffusion wave codes predict values up\nto 5 cm lower than the full shallow-water models and it is clear\nfrom Fig. 1 that there are no obvious major topographic features\npresent. It therefore appears that inertial effects only increase\nwater depths by a few centimetres but that this is suf\ufb01cient to\nallow extension of the \ufb02ood wave over a micro-topographic\nobstruction in this case.\nFor the part 2 analysis, a mini-ensemble of simulations was\ncomputed for each code using the pairs of friction coef\ufb01cients\ngiven in Table 2. For each model ensemble, the cumulative\ndistribution of water depths predicted at points X1\u2013X4 was\ncalculated at each time step (Fig. 5). In Fig. 5 the upper and lower\nblack lines represent the minimum and maximum water depths\npredicted by any ensemble member at a particular time step, while\nthe inner shaded area represents the 25\u201375% range of the\ncumulative distribution. These results are plotted spatially in Figs\n6, 7 and 8. Figs 6 and 7 show the magnitude of the range of water\ndepth (h) values predicted by each model in each grid cell at 30\nand 60min into the simulation respectively; Fig. 8 shows the\nmagnitude of the range of maximum predicted value of h in each\ngrid cell over the whole simulation.\nFigure 5 shows that the difference in water depths predicted by\neach model at points X1\u2013X4 for a wide (but physically realistic)\nrange of friction values is at least as great as the differences\nbetween models shown in Fig. 3. If we consider the range of\nfriction values to be typical of that used in model calibration, this\nsuggests that the minor differences between models can easily be\nsubsumed within parameter optimisation, particularly given\nuncertainties in terrain and boundary condition data. Fig. 5 also\nmore clearly shows the oscillatory behaviour of certain codes as\nWater Management 161 Issue WM1 Benchmarking 2D hydraulic models for urban \ufb02ooding Hunter et al. 19\nnoted earlier. This is probably because the lower friction value\nsimulations result in shallower water depths and higher velocities,\nwhich enhance such effects. Oscillations are most pronounced in\nthe full shallow-water codes that do not include shock capturing\n(TUFLOW and DIVAST), but minor oscillations can also be noted\nin the DIVAST-TVD and JFLOW results. TRENT and LISFLOOD-FP\nproduce the smoothest results, but this can only be achieved by\nLISFLOOD-FP at increased computational cost compared with\nTRENT. Fig. 5 also demonstrates the impact of the different\napproaches to time step control in JFLOW and LISFLOOD-FP. Both\nthese codes discretise the \ufb02oodplain as a series of raster storage\ncells and then use an explicit solution to calculate the inter-cell\n\ufb02uxes. Both require an adaptive time step to avoid the\ndevelopment of numerical oscillations and mass balance errors,\nbut JFLOW implements a conditionally stable scheme based on the\nCourant\u2013Friedrichs\u2013Levy (CFL) condition coupled with a \ufb02ow\nreversal constraint where the potential for oscillations is\nminimised but cannot be eliminated. LISFLOOD-FP uses an\nunconditionally stable scheme based on the classic von Neumann\nstability analysis for a diffusion system, which guarantees an\noscillation-free solution but at the expense of a \u00044% increase in\ncomputational overhead compared with JFLOW. While both\nmodels produce very similar results, small oscillations can be\nnoted at point X2 for the low-friction value simulations with\nJFLOW. However, as noted above, the oscillations do not seem to\naffect the overall wave propagation predicted by any of the codes\nand for similar test cases this should not be a factor in model\nselection.\nFigures 6 and 7 show both the magnitude of the range in possible\nwater depth values in each grid cell predicted by each model at a\ngiven time step and also how differences in the simulated wave\npropagation speed lead to different dynamic behaviour in each\nmodel. These differences are quite marked and, as previously\nnoted, it seems likely that subtle differences in how the friction or\nother energy loss laws are coded in each model accounts for many\nof these phase differences. For example, Fig. 7 shows that in the\nTUFLOW model much of the \ufb02ooded area has completely drained\n45\u00b700\n21\u00b720\nz: m\n400\n300\n200\n100\n0\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900\n(a)\nDIVAST\nD-TVD\nJFLOW\nLISFLOOD\nTRENT\nTUFLOW\n45\u00b707\n21\u00b718\nz: m\n400\n300\n200\n100\n0\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900\n(b)\nFig. 4.

Differences in predicted water depth in each\npixel between the highest and lowest friction simulations are most\nmarked at 30min into the simulation and can be up to 60 cm\ndepending on the particular time of arrival of the \ufb02ood wave in a\ncell. By 60min into the simulation, the magnitude of water depth\nrange predicted in each grid cell for the different friction values is\nmuch lower and is generally <10 cm apart from in the north-west\ncorner of the domain. Figs 6 and 7 also demonstrate the extension\nof the wave front into the area x < 150 by the full shallow-water\ncodes in contrast to the diffusion wave codes.\nFigure 8, while super\ufb01cially similar to Figs 6 and 7, is actually\nquite different in that it shows the magnitude of the range in\nmaximum water depths predicted in each model grid cell at any\ntime during the simulation. Effectively, this is the uncertainty in\npredicted maximum water depth generated by forcing each model\nwith a range of friction coef\ufb01cients. This con\ufb01rms the results of\nprevious studies (e.g. Lane et al.32 and Bates et al.33)\u2014that is, the\nresponse of a non-linear distributed model to uniform parameter\nchanges is spatially complex, but also shows, for the \ufb01rst time,\nthat this response is highly variable for similar but subtly different\nmodels. Thus, although each model is forced with the same\nspatially uniform changes in friction parameters, the patterns of\nchanges in maximum predicted depth that result are markedly\ndifferent. For example, Fig. 8 shows that the greatest uncertainty\nin maximum depth for the TRENT model (Fig. 8(e)) occurs around\npoints X1 and X3, while for the TUFLOW model (Fig. 8(f )) this\noccurs around point X2. Similar differences occur between all\nother codes. This implies that calibrating 2D hydraulic models\nagainst point data using spatially lumped parameters is unlikely to\nresult in spatially uniform changes in predicted \ufb02ow quantities\nover the whole model domain. In part this is likely to be due to\nnon-linear effects resulting from complex micro-topography, but\nmay also be due to the numerical solver used and its potentially\nnon-linear response to uniform forcing. In practice this will mean\nthat, even though a model may replicate observed data at\nparticular points, one cannot guarantee similar levels of\nperformance throughout the whole model domain. This also\nimplies that calibrating 2D hydraulic models is spatially complex\nand code-speci\ufb01c, and should be approached differently to the\nprocess of calibrating a 1D \ufb02ood routing model. Typical point-\nbased model calibration and validation data are therefore only a\nlimited test of model performance and new measuring techniques\nare urgently required to better understand the behaviour of, and\ndiscriminate between, competing model formulations.\n6. CONCLUSIONS\nThis paper has presented the most rigorous comparison to date\nof 2D hydraulic models applied to \ufb02ows in urban areas. While\nall the models tested produce plausible results, subtle differences\nbetween particular groups of codes give considerable insight\ninto both the practice and science of urban hydraulic modelling.\nIn practical terms, it was found that terrain data available from\nmodern LiDAR systems are suf\ufb01ciently accurate and resolved\nfor simulating urban \ufb02ows, but such data need to be fused with\ndigital map data of building topology and land use to gain\nmaximum bene\ufb01t from the information contained therein. This\nstudy also compared the relative impact of uncertainty over\nterrain data and model parameters on hydraulic model output.\nWhile the conclusions partly depend on the parameter and\nterrain error ranges fed into the analysis, it is clear that once\n\ufb01ne spatial resolution, high-accuracy terrain data are available,\nuncertainty over model parameters becomes the more dominant\nof these factors. In this case the best way to reduce uncertainty\nin model predictions is to \ufb01nd better ways to estimate model\nparameters, particularly friction, or to constrain these via a\nrobust calibration process. Remotely sensed and digital map\ndata may provide ways of estimating physical components of\nthe friction term directly (see Mason et al.34 for an example for\nrural \ufb02oodplains), however considerable uncertainty might still\nremain. In this case calibration becomes the only way of\nreducing uncertainty over model parameters, but to date few\nsuch data have been available for urban areas. Despite the\nfrequent occurrence of urban \ufb02oods, almost no \ufb01eld\nobservations of urban \ufb02ooding and no mechanisms for their\nroutine monitoring or post-event reconstruction are available.\nWith so little data available it becomes critically important for\nany urban \ufb02ood modelling study to examine the impact of a\nphysically plausible range of friction parameters on the results\nobtained, rather than just relying on single deterministic\nsimulations.\nIn terms of the science of urban hydraulic modelling, it was\nfound that \ufb02ows in such environments are characterised by\nnumerous transitions to supercritical \ufb02ow and numerical shocks.\nHowever, the effect of these are localised and they do not appear\nto affect overall wave propagation. For \ufb02ood risk studies it\ntherefore does not appear necessary to utilise a shock capturing\ncode unless an oscillation-free solution is important for some\nother reason. For this test case, inertial effects appear to be\nimportant in terms of inundation extent, although it is worth\nnoting that topographic slopes in the domain are high compared\nto typical \ufb02oodplain values; furthermore, the topology of the site\n(with long uninterrupted streets oriented in the main \ufb02ow\ndirection) may act to increase the importance of the inertial terms.\nThis conclusion therefore may not readily hold for other urban\nareas. What is clear, however, is that small differences in predicted\nwater elevation and micro-topographic barriers can combine in\nurban settings to give signi\ufb01cant differences in predicted\ninundated area. The water elevation differences that generate\nthese effects can be of the same order of magnitude as the height\nerrors in available terrain data (i.e. \u00045 cm RMSE) indicating the\nnonlinear sensitivity of urban \ufb02ooding to micro-topographic\neffects. However, for practical applications, uncertainty over\nin\ufb02ow boundary conditions (at least \u000610% for even the best\navailable data) is likely to induce water elevation differences over\nthe domain that are much greater than 5 cm. Uncertainty over\nboundary forcing may therefore be more important than whether\ninertial effects are included or not. Lastly, this study shows that\nassumptions about which classes of code will be more\ncomputationally expensive in particular situations do not always\nhold. In particular, it was perhaps surprising to \ufb01nd that storage\ncell codes were more expensive than full shallow-water codes for\nthe 2m grid used here. A solution may be to modify explicit\nstorage cell codes to include inertial terms (or simple\napproximations to these) that may allow the use of a larger stable\ntime step, and hence quicker run times, as well as including\nelements of the \ufb02ow physics that may be important in particular\nurban settings.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe research reported in this paper was conducted as part of\nthe Flood Risk Management Research Consortium (FRMRC).\n28 Water Management 161 Issue WM1 Benchmarking 2D hydraulic models for urban \ufb02ooding Hunter et al.\nThe FRMRC is supported by grant GR\/S76304 from the\nEngineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, in\npartnership with the Natural Environment Research Council, the\nDefra\/EA Joint Research Programme on Flood and Coastal\nDefence, the Scottish Executive and the Rivers Agency (Northern\nIreland).
