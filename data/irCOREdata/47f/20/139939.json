INTRODUCTION \n \nCurrent endoscopic optical coherence tomography (OCT) probes comprise a single fibre mounted in an external \nhousing1, 2. Lenses focus the output beam from the delivery fibre onto the sample of interest, providing an OCT \nmeasurement at a single point, and the beam is scanned in one or two dimensions to address a line or area of sampling \npoints within the region of interest. The use of rotating components within the endoscope tip provides imaging over an \narc centred on the probe, which is particularly suitable for looking at the internal surfaces of cylindrical samples3. \nImplementations involving miniature scanners or MEMS devices have also been demonstrated, which commonly address \na rectangular region of the sample surface4. \nA coherent imaging fibre bundle is an ordered arrangement of small-diameter fibre cores, each of which occupies the \nsame relative position in the surrounding matrix at either end of the bundle. Imaging fibre bundles typically contain \n10,000-100,000 fibres with core diameters ranging from a few micrometres to a few tens of micrometres. An image \nprojected onto one end of the bundle is transmitted to the opposite end without distortion. \nWe have previously investigated the use of bundles in a time-domain (TD) OCT system using a broadband SLD source.  \nMeasurements from all fibres were acquired simultaneously using a CCD camera5. Although partially successful, phase \ndrift of OCT fringes between frames was a problem in this relatively slow system. Also, using a camera meant that pre-\ndigitisation filtering was unavailable, limiting image contrast. Work by a group from California discusses an alternative \nimplementation for a TD-OCT system6, in which a bundle forms the sample arm of a fibre Michelson interferometer, and \na beam scans across the input end of the bundle. OCT imaging of rabbit trachea was demonstrated with this system. \nThe swept-source used in our current system, with Fourier-domain processing, removes the requirement for depth-\nscanning, enabling a common-path probe design in which the bundle does not form part of the OCT interferometer. This \nis advantageous for several reasons. Firstly, it is not possible to control the state of polarisation (SOP) within all (or \nindeed any) of the individual fibres of a coherent bundle. Thus fringe visibility will vary between fibres, leading to poor \ncontrast in some parts of the image if the bundle resides within the interferometer. Secondly, an imaging bundle has a \nhigh NA; fibres can be few-moded under some coupling conditions, leading to ghost images, as reported by Xie et al.6. A \ncommon path arrangement alleviates both ghosting and problems due to dispersion, including modal dispersion. \n \n2.   TRANSMISSION PROPERTIES OF COHERENT FIBRE BUNDLES \n \nStandard coherent bundles are intended for use in the visible. These can be few-moded in the near IR under some \ncoupling conditions. Internal losses in bundles are higher than in single fibres; there is the loss of light that impinges on \nregions outside the fibre cores, and is therefore unguided. There is also some absorption in the fibres.

Schematic of common-path FD-OCT system using a Michelson \ninterferometer at the probe tip and incorporating an imaging bundle.  \nSchott bundles is quoted at around 40% for a 1 metre bundle in the visible region of the spectrum. The quoted loss \ntypically includes reflections of about 4% at the proximal and distal polished surfaces, though these can be suppressed by \nangle-polishing the ends of the guide and, potentially, by application of coatings to the end surfaces.  \nWe are currently using leached imaging bundles supplied by Schott North America7. Leached bundles are manufactured \nfrom hexagonally-packed rods, comprising core, cladding and secondary cladding \nfused into a rigid bar, drawn to achieve the required core diameter, then etching the \nsecondary cladding from the central section to leave a flexible image conduit. The \npacking arrangement in the ~1 cm rigid sections at either end is as shown in figure 1. \nFor OCT, optimum imaging wavelengths are in the near infra-red. The transmission \nof bundle fibres, however, drops off at higher wavelengths and the glass exhibits an \ninconvenient OH absorption at around 1400 nm8 which affects the upper end of our \nlaser sweep range, centred at 1330 nm. The overall transmission of a 1350 mm long \nbundle, measured with the swept source, was only around 6-8%, including fill-factor \nand end-reflection losses. Since the beam must traverse the bundle twice in the OCT \nsystem, less than 1% of the initial coupled power is returned to the detector, ignoring \nother losses in the system. The simplest means to minimise losses is to use a shorter \nbundle; lengths of about 0.5 m are readily available. Another possibility is a bundle \nspecifically designed for use in the infra-red. These are now offered for sale, though \nthe spectral transmission characteristics for the entire wavelength range of interest are \nnot readily available.   \nIt is also important in OCT that internal cross-coupling between the fibres should be \nnegligible. In the leached bundle used here, 1300 nm light was well-confined to a single core but, at wavelengths \napproaching 1550 nm, light focused into one core emerged at the distal end from multiple cores, with the internal cross-\ncoupling worsening as wavelength increased.  \n \n3.   BUNDLE-BASED SWEPT-SOURCE OCT PROBE DESIGN \n \n3.1 Outline of system  \nThe OCT probe design, shown in figure 2, incorporates an imaging bundle and a 20 kHz swept laser at 1330 nm centre \nwavelength. The system operates in the spectral domain, with a fixed path-length imbalance. Mechanical scanning of the \nbeam takes place at the bundle input end, while mechanical motion within the endoscopic section is avoided. A common-\npath configuration has been chosen to avoid loss of visibility due to polarisation mismatches9. A miniature Michelson \ninterferometer was constructed at the probe tip, using a broadband 20\/80 beamsplitter cube. This achieves a ratio of \nsignal\/reference beam powers appropriate for good visibility OCT fringes, without the necessity for attenuation of the \nreference beam. The side-illumination of the sample allows all the optical elements at the probe tip to be centred on the \noptical axis, allowing a small probe \ndiameter to be achieved by the use of \nappropriate components. Light is coupled \nfrom the laser, via a broadband circulator, to \nthe optical bench. At the output fibre, an \naspheric lens collimates the beam onto a \nsingle-axis galvanometer mirror. This will \nshortly be upgraded for full 3D acquisition. \nA second aspheric lens focuses the beam \nonto the bundle input face, with a beam \nwaist smaller than the fibre core diameter. \nThe beam is currently scanned raster-\nfashion at 80 Hz across the input end of the \nbundle. A scan rate is selected to ensure a \nquasi-static beam during the 50 \u03bcs duration \nof the wavelength sweep. Step-and-settle \nscanning, where the beam is stepped to each \nfibre in turn, is also being investigated. The mirror scan is synchronised with acquisition; a digitiser collects several \nhundred data points in the z dimension (depth) for each laser sweep. \n \n8 \u03bcm pixel \nFigure 1.

Although the high NA can lead to multi-moding, this is limited \nby using an input lens with a lower NA. At the probe tip, large NA imaging results in a small beam waist, but a poor \nRayleigh range. Reducing the NA improves the depth of focus, but in turn leads to reduced lateral resolution, so a \ncompromise must be reached between the interdependent imaging parameters. Our system operates at present with a \nmagnification of about 2.5. This provides a Rayleigh range of about 100 \u03bcm with a lateral resolution of about 20-25 \u03bcm. \nFor a probe with unit magnification, the lateral resolution of the instrument is equal to the core spacing. The depth \nresolution is determined by the sweep range of the laser source. For the 1330 nm source, with ~100 nm sweep range, \nused in this study, a depth resolution of about 8 \u03bcm in air is expected. \nIn contrast to a single-fibre OCT probe, the focusing optics must ensure low-loss, low-aberration imaging for off-axis \nobject points. The field of view for the probe lens is typically rather small, since the coherent bundle diameter is unlikely \nto exceed 2 mm. However, significant care is still required to ensure adequate operation towards the periphery of the \nimages. At present, with a 1 mm diameter bundle, aspheric lenses result in well-focused images of peripheral fibres but, \nfor larger diameter bundles, coated, multi-element lenses are likely to be the best solution. \nLight returning from the OCT probe re-enters the delivery fibre, and is directed by the circulator to one arm of a 15 MHz \nbandwidth balanced detector. A small amount of source light, routed to the second arm of the balanced detector via a \nvariable optical attenuator, allows much of this stray light to be balanced out, thereby improving OCT contrast. \nThe output from the detector is passed to a high-speed digitiser card, synchronised both to the laser scan and to the \nscanning mirror frequency. 800-1500 samples are acquired for each sweep of the laser. The total number of A-scans per \nraster is currently set to about 200. This ensures that each fibre is sampled at least once, assuming good coupling into all \nfibres. A Fourier transform is performed on the data set (re-sampling from wavelength into frequency space is required \nfirst, to optimise resolution), and the logarithm of the result is calculated to produce a pseudo real-time display (~5 Hz) \nof the images. Lateral resolution is ultimately determined by the fibre core separation, and depth resolution by the laser \nsweep range. \n \n4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \nThe system was tested, initially on glass samples and subsequently on samples of vegetable tissue. Results are shown in \nfigure 3. Images obtained from a single-fibre OCT system, of identical configuration to the bundle-based system except \nthat the scanning was moved to the probe tip, are also shown for comparison. It is clear that the SNR, as would be \nexpected, is currently much higher in the single-fibre system. The optical power at the detector is sufficient to obtain \nnear-saturation, even with additional attenuation of the reference beam. Unfortunately this is not the case at present for \nthe bundle-based system, and detector noise dominates. \nImages from the bundle-based system were acquired prior to the introduction of re-sampling from wavelength to \nfrequency, hence the lower depth resolution. However, in the image of a microscope cover slip (figure 3(c)) the front and \nrear surfaces, represented by the top and bottom lines in the image, are clearly visible, separated by about 200 \u03bcm. The \nintermediate line is due to a self-interference between reflections from the front and rear surfaces of the cover slip, and \nappears because the reflected intensities for this object are comparable to that of the reference reflection. Unlike the other \ntwo lines in the image, this one does not move as the object is translated along the optical axis, because the path-length \ndifference is fixed by the object thickness. Figure 3(d) shows preliminary results from a sample of spring onion. The \nSNR is low in this image, probably as a result of the very high bundle transmission loss, but two layers can be clearly \ndistinguished, separated by about 100-200 \u03bcm. Features arising from the bundle characteristics are visible in the lower \nimages. There is a distinctive pixilation, which corresponds to illumination by individual fibres, and a lack of signal in \nthe interstitial \u2018dead spaces\u2019. Images could be improved by smoothing or, at the expense of a reduction in lateral \nresolution and power at the detector, by enlarging the beam waist at the bundle input to a diameter exceeding that of the \nfibre cores. The pixilation is prominent here because the image is formed by a bundle containing a relatively small \nnumber of fibres; the number within this scan is about 65. It would be desirable to select a bundle of somewhat greater \ndiameter, containing a larger number of fibres of smaller core diameter. This would improve the data density within the \nimage. Another feature of figure 3(d) is the periodic variation in intensity across the image, attributed to a misalignment \nbetween the raster scan and the fibre packing directions. Unless the rows of bundle fibres are perfectly aligned with the \nraster scan, the coupling will vary periodically as the beam traverses the rows, giving rise to \u2018patchiness\u2019 of the detected \nsignal. This is a problem only for a single transverse scan, and can be removed by acquiring several scans with a lateral \noffset of a few microns between each, and averaging. When 2D mirror scanning is introduced, smoothing will have the \nsame effect. \nProc. of SPIE Vol. 7503  75030X-3\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 14 Feb 2011 to 138.250.27.79.

The in-air \nsystem resolution is currently about 25 \u03bcm \n(lateral) and about 8 \u03bcm (depth) when re-\nsampling is applied. The Rayleigh range is \nabout 100 \u03bcm. The maximum number of \nfibres per image, corresponding to a diameter \nof the bundle, is about 100. \nImmediate plans for development of the \nsystem are to implement 2D scanning and to \ninvestigate the effect of substituting either a \nshorter, or an IR-specific bundle for the \ncurrent 1350 mm long bundle. We expect \nthereby to improve image contrast and \nexpand the range of sample types accessible \nto our system. We plan also to improve the \ndata density of our images by the acquisition \nof alternative bundles, containing more fibres \nof smaller core size and spacing.  \nA loss of contrast occurs at present, towards \nthe periphery of the images, because of beam \n\u2018walk-off\u2019 from the reference mirror for large-angle rays. Modification of the optics in the probe-end imaging system \nwill reduce this problem. \n \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n \nWe are grateful for a grant (EP\/F034679\/1) from the Engineering and Physical Science Research Council, UK. \n \nREFERENCES \n \n[1]   Feldchtein, F.
