They contribute to the\nmaintenance of tissue homeostasis, wound repair [1,2]\nand revascularisation [3], as well as exerting protective\nroles in both acquired and innate immune responses to\nbacterial infection [4]. However, mast cells are synony-\nmous with allergy due to the destructive effects of their\nmediators when released in excess through IgE-dependent\nmechanisms. In asthma, mast cells infiltrate the airway\nsmooth muscle (ASM) bundles, airway epithelium and\nsubmucosal glands, placing them in direct contact with\nthese dysfunctional airway elements [5].\nMast cells can be activated by many diverse stimuli lead-\ning to mediator release but allergen-dependent activation\noccurs predominantly through the high affinity IgE recep-\ntor complex (Fc\u03b5RI) following aggregation of allergen-spe-\nPublished: 23 January 2008\nBMC Immunology 2008, 9:2 doi:10.1186\/1471-2172-9-2\nReceived: 3 September 2007\nAccepted: 23 January 2008\nThis article is available from: http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2172\/9\/2\n\u00a9 2008 Cruse et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. \nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/2.0), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Page 1 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Immunology 2008, 9:2 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2172\/9\/2cific IgE bound to Fc\u03b5RI (Reviewed in [6,7]). IgE binding\nto Fc\u03b5RI in the absence of antigen has long been consid-\nered to represent a passive sensitisation of mast cells.\nHowever, this view has been challenged due to increasing\nevidence that monomeric IgE binding to Fc\u03b5RI initiates\nintracellular signalling events leading to distinct cellular\nresponses [8-19]. IgE alone directly activates human lung\nmast cells (HLMC) leading to Ca2+ influx and the release\nof histamine, leukotriene C4 (LTC4) and CXCL8 [8]. Thus\nincreased IgE production in atopic asthma could directly\ncontribute to the mast cell hypersecretion and prolonged\nactivation evident within asthmatic bronchi [5].\nUnderstanding the mechanisms of mast cell hyperplasia\nin diseased tissue structures is of interest because inhibit-\ning this might offer new approaches to treatment.\nIncreased mast cell recruitment by the asthmatic ASM for\nexample appears to be one factor [20]. However enhanced\nmast cell survival might be a further factor. In rodents, IgE\nnot only activates mast cells leading to mediator release,\nbut also prolongs their survival through the autocrine pro-\nduction of survival-enhancing cytokines, particularly IL-3\n[21]. IgE-dependent mast cell survival may therefore also\nbe a factor contributing to the increased numbers of mast\ncells evident in key airway structures of the asthmatic air-\nway.\nIn this study, we have tested the hypothesis that IgE alone\nenhances HLMC survival through the production of the\nsurvival enhancing cytokines IL-6 and stem cell factor. We\ndemonstrate for the first time that monomeric IgE in the\nabsence of antigen enhances HLMC survival, and that this\neffect is mediated, at least in part, through the autocrine\nproduction of IL-6.\nResults\nIgE alone promotes HLMC survival following cytokine \nwithdrawal\nHuman lung mast cells undergo apoptosis with SCF and\nIL-6 withdrawal [22]. We therefore tested the effects of IgE\nalone on mast cell survival following SCF, IL-6 and IL-10\nwithdrawal. Following cytokine withdrawal, there was\nevidence of a decrease in cell viability in the control cells,\nwhich contained no IgE, even as early as 24 hours which\nwas significant by day 3 (Figure 1A) (p = 0.020, n = 6).\nThere was a significant dose-dependent increase in HLMC\nviability with the addition of IgE by day 7 when compared\nto the sodium azide control (Figure 1A). Thus at day 7,\nHLMC % viability was 11.0 \u00b1 6.0% in the control com-\npared to 13.3 \u00b1 7.5% with 0.00015% sodium azide (p =\n0.3419, n = 6). With the addition of 0.1, 0.3, 1 and 3 \u03bcg\/\nml IgE, HLMC % viability was 21.3 \u00b1 8.8, 25.4 \u00b1 8.2, 26.9\n\u00b1 7.6 and 30.5 \u00b1 7.0% respectively (Figure 1A) (p =\n0.0397, p = 0.0056, p = 0.0214 and p = 0.0014 respec-\ntively, n = 6). Interestingly, we found there to be no signif-\nicant difference between the sodium azide control and the\ncells alone at either days 1, 3, 7 or 10 (p = 0.3781, p =\n0.9595, p = 0.3419 and p = 0.7462 respectively, n = 6).\nIn order to determine the mechanism of the enhancement\nof mast cell survival with IgE we next investigated the\nautocrine production of the pro-survival cytokines SCF\nand IL-6. There was absolutely no effect on survival with\nthe addition of neutralising anti-SCF (1 \u03bcg\/ml) or isotype\ncontrol antibodies (Figure 1B). However, with the addi-\ntion of neutralising anti-IL-6 (1 \u03bcg\/ml) there was a\nmarked decrease in the number of viable cells compared\nto the isotype control (Figure 1B). Thus in the isotype con-\ntrol, there were 2467 \u00b1 309 viable cells at day 7 compared\nto 517 \u00b1 204 viable cells with the addition of anti-IL-6\n(Figure 1B) (p = 0.041, n = 3). As an additional control,\nwe also investigated the effects of IgG on HLMC survival.\nThus with the addition of 3 \u03bcg\/ml IgE, there were 2008 \u00b1\n143 viable cells at day 7 compared to 712 \u00b1 189 viable\ncells with the addition of 3 \u03bcg\/ml IgG (Figure 1C) (p =\n0.005, n = 4). Therefore, the addition of IgG did not affect\nHLMC survival when compared to the sodium azide con-\ntrol (712 \u00b1 189 viable cells with 3 \u03bcg\/ml IgG, compared to\n906 \u00b1 208 viable cells in the sodium azide control, Figure\n1C, p = 0.515, n = 4).\nQuantitative real time RT-PCR\nIn order to confirm that IL-6 expression in HLMC was\nupregulated with the addition of IgE alone, comparative\nquantitative real time RT-PCR was carried out and the rel-\native expression of IL-6 mRNA in IgE (3 \u03bcg\/ml)-stimu-\nlated cells compared to unstimulated cells. The relative\nexpression of IL-6 mRNA in the IgE-stimulated cells was\nincreased 46997 \u00b1 41171 fold compared to control (Fig-\nure 2) (p = 0.043, n = 14) when calculated with the\nMx3000P's built in algorithm with an adaptive baseline.\nThe degree of upregulation was highly variable, but was\nconsistently greater than the control which in 2 donors\ndid not achieve Ct even after 50 cycles (Figure 3). The 2\ndonors where the control reaction did not reach Ct had a\nrelative expression of 577000 and 80591, which accounts\nfor the huge relative expression and variability when the\nmean is plotted. We therefore analysed the data using the\nmedian and range. The median (range) relative expression\nof IL-6 mRNA was 3.79 (1.01\u2013577000) when compared\nto control.\nDue to this inherent variability, and since the determina-\ntion of relative expression can vary greatly depending on\nthe algorithm used, we next confirmed the gene upregula-\ntion using the 2-\u0394\u0394Ct method which has been validated as\na good measure of relative gene expression [23]. The mean\nCt Target \u2013 Ct Calibrator for IL-6 in the control was 17.93. With\nthe addition of 3 \u03bcg\/ml IgE, the mean Ct Target \u2013 Ct Calibrator\nwas 13.62 (p = 0.018, n = 14). Thus using the 2-\u0394\u0394Ct calcu-Page 2 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Immunology 2008, 9:2 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2172\/9\/2lation, the relative expression of IL-6 following IgE stimu-\nlation was upregulated by 29445 \u00b1 21013 (Figure 2),\nwhich is comparable to the data from the Mx3000P algo-\nrithm. The median (range) relative expression of IL-6\nmRNA was 3.38 (1.0\u2013267652) when compared to control\nusing the 2-\u0394\u0394Ct algorithm. For statistical analysis, Ct data\nwas imported into the Relative Expression Software Tool\n(REST 2005, version 1.9.12, Corbett Life Science) which\nuses a different algorithm. The relative expression using\nthe REST algorithm was almost identical to the 2-\u0394\u0394Ct algo-\nrithm with an upregulation of 29445 \u00b1 21013 (Figure 2),\nwhich after bootstrapping with 50 000 iterations was sig-\nnificant (p = 0.043, n = 14).\nA dissociation curve was performed on all experiments\nand a distinct peak was observed consistently around\n79.5\u00b0C for IL-6 and around 85.8\u00b0C for \u03b2-actin (Figure 4).\nQRT-PCR products were run on a 1.5% agarose gel to\ndetermine the product size and the IL-6 product was\nindeed 250 bp and \u03b2-actin was 310 bp (Figure 5). Bands\nwere gel excised, purified and sequenced which confirmed\nspecificity.\nMeasurement of IL-6 release using ELISA\nTo confirm that the upregulation of IL-6 transcription\nwith the addition of IgE was associated with an increased\nrelease of IL-6, we next measured the IL-6 released into the\nIgE promotes the survival of cultured human lung mast cells through IL-6Figu e 1\nIgE promotes the survival of cultured human lung mast cells through IL-6.

This suggests that IgE-dependent\nHLMC survival is mediated, in part, through the autocrine\nproduction of IL-6.\nWe have found that in the presence of clinically relevant\nconcentrations of IgE (1 \u03bcg\/ml = ~400 kU\/L), HLMC sur-\nvival is enhanced following growth factor withdrawal.\nAlthough SCF is the major growth and survival factor for\nHLMC, and is released by them in an autocrine manner\n[24], IgE-dependent survival was not accounted for via an\nSCF-dependent mechanism because neutralising SCF was\nwithout effect. In contrast, neutralisation of IL-6 com-\npletely inhibited the survival effect indicating that survival\nwas mediated at least in part through IL-6. IL-6 is known\nto prevent apoptosis in HLMC and cord blood-derived\nmast cells (HCBMC) [25,26], and so this mechanism is\nentirely plausible. It is further supported by the fact that\nIL-6 mRNA expression was increased markedly in the\npresence of IgE and this was paralleled by a small but sig-\nnificant increase in the secretion of IL-6 protein into the\nHLMC culture supernatant. The concentration of IL-6 in\nthe culture supernatant in the presence of 3 \u03bcg\/ml IgE was\napproximately 426 pg\/ml. This is not far below the opti-\nmal concentration of 1 ng\/ml required to prevent apopto-\nsis of HCBMC following growth factor withdrawal [25].\nHowever, HLMC tend to aggregate in cell culture, and so\nare likely to be exposed to much higher local concentra-\ntions of HLMC-derived IL-6 than that present in the whole\nculture supernatant. However, there was also approxi-\nmately 355 pg\/ml of IL-6 in the control supernatant in\nwhich the HLMC had died, suggesting that although IL-6\npromotes survival with IgE, a co-operative interaction\nwith IgE-dependent signalling is also likely. Indeed, a\nstudy published while this paper was out for review dem-\nonstrated that monomeric IgE alone induced the upregu-\nlation of both mRNA and protein expression of the anti-\napoptotic Bcl-xL protein, whilst down-regulating the\nexpression of the pro-apoptotic proteins Puma and Bim\n[27].\nA study of the effects of anti-IgE therapy (omalizumab) on\nairway inflammation in asthma identified a downward\nTotal IgE-induced IL-6 release into the supernatants at day 7 following cytokine withdrawalFigure 6\nTotal IgE-induced IL-6 release into the supernatants \nat day 7 following cytokine withdrawal.

There is therefore insufficient clinical data\nat present to confirm or refute the in vivo relevance of our\nin vitro findings regarding the ability of IgE to enhance\nmast cell survival. An important feature of mast cell acti-\nvation in the presence of IgE alone is that while free IgE is\npresent, intracellular signalling is sustained, whereas this\nceases as soon as free IgE is removed [14]. The mecha-\nnisms behind this are still not known but indicate that\nthis signalling mechanism is likely to be important in vivo\nwhere IgE exposure is continuous. Bearing in mind the\nstrong correlation between serum IgE and the presence of\nasthma [29-32], it is conceivable that IgE contributes to\nthe increased numbers of mast cells evident in the airway\nepithelium, mucosal glands and airway smooth muscle of\nasthmatic subjects [5].\nWe have demonstrated recently that IgE in the absence of\nantigen directly activates cultured HLMC leading to the\nrelease of histamine, and the production of LTC4 and\nCXCL8 [8]. The release of histamine and LTC4 was much\ngreater in the presence of SCF, a vital growth and differen-\ntiation factor for human mast cells which also potentiates\nIgE-dependent mediator release [22,33]. However in the\npresent study, when HLMC were incubated with IgE in the\nabsence of any exogenous cytokines substantial IL-6 pro-\nduction was evident. This indicates that while SCF is\nrequired for substantial histamine release [8], monomeric\nIgE-induced cytokine production can proceed in it's\nabsence. This is in keeping with 2 studies of human cord\nblood-derived mast cells (HCBMC) which failed to detect\nhistamine release in the absence of SCF but did demon-\nstrate the release of the chemokines CCL1, CCL2 and\nCXCL8 [15,34]. The study of HCBMC by Matsuda and col-\nleagues also failed to find any survival effect with IgE [15].\nOne factor which might explain the difference in response\nbetween HLMC and HCBMC in terms of both histamine\nrelease and survival is the degree of surface Fc\u03b5RI expres-\nsion. Fc\u03b5RI expression is relatively low on HCBMC [35],\nand demonstrates one example of the heterogeneity evi-\ndent between mast cells from different tissues. Thus, mast\ncells with higher Fc\u03b5RI expression appear to be more reac-\ntive to IgE, which may also contribute to the pro-survival\neffect evident in this study. A second factor of relevance\nmay be the preparations of IgE used in the different stud-\nies. In mice, it has been demonstrated that some prepara-\ntions of IgE are much more effective at promoting both\ndegranulation and cytokine-dependent survival\n[10,16,36]. Although IL-6 is among those cytokines\nreleased by mBMMC, recent studies suggest that IL-3, a\nknown growth factor for mouse BMMC, is the major\ncytokine involved in their protection from cell death [21].\nMatsuda and colleagues found that the sodium azide\npresent in their myeloma IgE preparation enhanced sur-\nvival in the absence of IgE. For this reason, we ensured\nthat all of our experimental conditions contained an\nequal amount of sodium azide, and included an appropri-\nate sodium azide control. We also found there to be a\nsmall survival enhancing effect with the addition of\nsodium azide to the cells, but this was far less marked than\nthat reported by Matsuda et al [15]. However the concen-\ntration of azide in their experiments was 2 fold higher\nthan ours, although they showed there to be only around\n6% difference in apoptotic cells between 0.0003%\nsodium azide and concentrations 100 fold less [15].\nTherefore, small differences in sodium azide concentra-\ntion are very unlikely to have any great effect on the sur-\nvival data.\nMast cell signalling and responses to IgE alone raise the\nquestion as to whether the IgE preparations used are truly\nmonomeric or just complexes of IgE which mimic recep-\ntor cross-linking with antigen, and whether the physiolog-\nical concentrations of IgE used in vitro induce IgE to self\naggregate at the receptor [37,38]. In fact, there is evidence\nthat like receptor crosslinking with allergen, the signalling\nfrom IgE alone in the absence of allergen is also a result of\nreceptor aggregation [10]. However, there are several lines\nof evidence which indicate that although receptor aggre-\ngation is initiated, distinct signalling pathways are\nrecruited and that the effects of IgE alone are not an arte-\nfact. For example, although influx of extracellular Ca2+ is a\ncritical requirement for mediator release in mast cells acti-\nvated by either IgE alone or by antigen, the channels car-\nrying Ca2+ into the cell following monomeric IgE\nstimulation appear to be different [13]. In addition,\ncytokine release induced by IgE alone is often much\ngreater than that initiated in antigen-stimulated cells\n[11,17]. Furthermore, IgE induced Ca2+ influx requires\nPKC\u03b2II whilst antigen-induced Ca2+ influx does not [11].\nInterestingly, HPLC purification of human myeloma\nmonomeric IgE, which ensures that there are no multi\/\ndimeric complexes, does not abrogate the biological\nresponse and, if anything, enhances it [15]. Furthermore,\nwhile IgE induces marked IL-6 production from mouse\nBMMC, IgE aggregates have no effect [17], confirming that\nmast cell responses to IgE are not due to IgE aggregates.\nThere is therefore robust evidence that the greater the per-\ncentage of IgE monomers, the greater the biological\nresponse. All of these observations point towards distinct\nsignalling pathways in mast cells activated by IgE alone\nversus antigen-dependent Fc\u03b5RI cross-linking.Page 6 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Immunology 2008, 9:2 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2172\/9\/2Conclusion\nIn summary, we demonstrate that IgE in the absence of\nantigen promotes HLMC survival in a dose-dependent\nmanner, and that this survival is markedly attenuated with\nthe addition of neutralising anti-IL-6 antibody. Since IL-6\nmRNA transcription is dramatically upregulated with the\naddition of IgE, and there is an increased release of IL-6\ninto the supernatant of IgE stimulated cells, we can con-\nclude that the prosurvival effect of IgE in HLMC is due, at\nleast in part, to the autocrine production of IL-6. This\nstudy provides a further mechanism through which IL-6\nand IgE contribute to the pathogenesis of asthma, and\nthrough which anti-IgE therapy might achieve its thera-\npeutic effect.\nMethods\nPurification and culture of human lung mast cells\nAll human subjects gave written informed consent and the\nstudy was approved by the Leicestershire Research Ethics\nCommittee, UK. Lung tissue was obtained by surgical\nresection for bronchial carcinoma and mast cells isolated\nas described previously [39]. The final HLMC purity was\n>98% with cell viability >97% (monitored by exclusion of\ntrypan blue).\nFollowing isolation, HLMC were cultured in DMEM\/\nGlutamax\/HEPES containing 10% FBS, 1% MEM nones-\nsential amino acids (all from Life Technologies), 1% anti-\nbiotic\/antimycotic solution (Sigma-Aldrich), 100 ng\/mL\nrecombinant human (rh)SCF, 50 ng\/mL rhIL-6 and 10\nng\/mL rhIL-10 (R&D, Abingdon, UK) at 37\u00b0C in a humid-\nified incubator flushed with 5% CO2 for a minimum of 4\nweeks prior to experiments. Half of the medium was\nchanged every 7 days. HLMC purity remained unchanged\nduring the culture period.\nHLMC survival assay\nLong term cultured HLMC were counted using an haemo-\ncytometer and cell viability assessed using exclusion of\ntrypan blue stain. HLMC were washed to remove the\ncytokines present in the culture medium. 1 \u00d7 104 HLMC\nwere plated into each well of a 96 well cell culture plate in\n50 \u03bcl of DMEM\/10% FBS. 50 \u03bcl of 2\u00d7 the final concentra-\ntion of human myeloma IgE (Calbiochem-Novabiochem,\nNottingham, UK) or medium alone was added. IgE was\ncentrifuged at 14000 g for 20 min to remove any large\naggregates [8,15]. IgE preparations (100 \u03bcg\/ml) contain\n0.005% sodium azide. Therefore, dilutions of IgE were\nprepared to give a final concentration of sodium azide of\n0.00015% in all conditions (including a control) except\nfor the cytokine control (containing 100 ng\/ml SCF, 50\nng\/ml IL-6 and 10 ng\/ml IL-10) and the no-azide control.\nAt the indicated time points from 1\u201310 days, wells were\naspirated and any adherent HLMC were removed using\ntrypsin solution (Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK).\nAspirated cells were transferred to a 96 well V bottom\nplate and centrifuged at 300 \u00d7 g for 5 minutes. Superna-\ntants were removed and stored at -20\u00b0C and cells were\nresuspended in 10 \u03bcl of DMEM. 10 \u03bcl of trypan blue solu-\ntion was added to the cells and cell number and viability\nwere assessed using a haemocytometer.\nFor the determination of pro-survival cytokine activity in\nthe cultures, neutralising anti-human IL-6 (1 \u03bcg\/ml)\n(mouse IgG1), anti-human SCF (1 \u03bcg\/ml) (goat polyclo-\nnal IgG) or an isotype control (1 \u03bcg\/ml) (mouse IgG1)\nantibodies (all from R&D, Abingdon, UK) were added to\ncultures containing 3 \u03bcg\/ml IgE.\nIsolation of HLMC total RNA\n2 \u00d7 106 HLMC were incubated for 24 hours in growth\nmedium with or without 3 \u03bcg\/ml IgE in 6 well plates.\nCells were aspirated and centrifuged at 250 \u00d7 g for 8 min-\nutes. Supernatants were removed and the cells resus-\npended in 25 ml of sterile PBS before centrifuging again.\nTotal RNA was then isolated using an SV Total RNA Isola-\ntion System (Promega, Southampton, UK) according to\nthe manufacturer's instructions.\nQuantitative real-time RT-PCR\nQuantitative real time RT-PCR was performed using a sin-\ngle tube Full Velocity SYBR Green Kit (Stratagene, Amster-\ndam, Netherlands). Primers were designed for IL-6 to\nspan exon-exon junctions to eliminate DNA contamina-\ntion issues. PCR products were designed to be between\n200 and 300 base pairs in length in line with the optimum\nlength for SYBR green use. The Full Velocity SYBR Green\nQRT-PCR kit uses a combined annealing\/extension step of\n60\u00b0C. Therefore, all primers were designed to have a Tm\nwithin 1\u00b0C of 60\u00b0C. Primer3 software was used for the\ndesign of the primers [40]. Primer sequences for IL-6 were:\nforward primer 5'-GCACTGGCAGAAAACAACCT-3';\nreverse primer 5'-CAGGGGTGGTTATTGCATCT-3'. The\nproduct length for IL-6 was 253 bp.\nThe QRT-PCR reaction was optimised for each gene and\n200 nM final concentration of primers was assessed as the\noptimum for use over all conditions. Using this concen-\ntration of primers ensured no non-specific amplification\noccurred in the sample wells. Reverse transcription was\ncarried out for 30 minutes at 50\u00b0C before 5 minutes at\n95\u00b0C was used to inactivate the reverse transcriptase\nwhich otherwise interferes with the DNA polymerase. 50\ncycles of 95\u00b0C for 20 seconds followed by 60\u00b0C for 30\nseconds were carried out and fluorescence was collected at\nthe end of each extension cycle using the Mx3000P QPCR\nmachine (Stratagene). A SYBR green dissociation curve\nwas carried out at the end of the reactions to ensure spe-\ncificity and products were run on 1.5% agarose gels to\ndetermine product length. Products were gel purifiedPage 7 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Immunology 2008, 9:2 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2172\/9\/2(QIAGEN, Crawley, UK) and sequenced using the Protein\nand Nucleic Acid Chemistry Laboratory, University of\nLeicester.\nFor the comparative QRT-PCR, the internal normaliser\ngene used was \u03b2-actin and all mRNA expression data were\nnormalised to \u03b2-actin and corrected using the reference\ndye (ROX). The \u03b2-actin primer sequences used were: for-\nward primer \u2013 5'-TTCAACTCCATCATGAAGTGTGACGTG\n\u2013 3', reverse primer \u2013 5'-CTAAGTCATAGTCCGCCTA-\nGAAGCATT \u2013 3'. The product length for \u03b2-actin was 310\nbp. Only experiments where a distinct single peak was\nobserved with a melting temperature different to that of\nthe no template control were used. Expression data was\nexpressed as the relative gene expression compared to the\ncalibrator (unstimulated cells) as determined by the\nMx3000P software's built in algorithm using an adaptive\nbaseline to determine the Ct.\nMeasurement of IL-6 in HLMC supernatants\nSupernatants removed from the survival assays were\nstored at -20\u00b0C prior to measurement of IL-6. Samples\nwere measured for IL-6 from conditions following 7 days\nof cytokine withdrawal. IL-6 was measured using the\nQuantikine human IL-6 ELISA kit (R&D, Abingdon, UK)\naccording to the manufacturer's instructions.\nStatistical analysis\nData is presented as the mean \u00b1 SEM unless otherwise\nstated. IL-6 release is presented as ng\/106 cells. Differences\nbetween paired data were evaluated using Student's paired\ntwo-tailed t tests. Comparative quantitative RT-PCR data\nis presented as the relative expression compared to control\n(untreated cells) after correction against the internal cali-\nbrator \u03b2-actin as determined by the Mx3000P software's\nbuilt in algorithm using an adaptive baseline to determine\nthe Ct. Due to the inherent variability of relative expres-\nsion data according to the algorithm used, relative expres-\nsion was also calculated using the 2-\u0394\u0394Ct method [23] and\nthe Relative Expression Software Tool (REST 2005, version\n1.9.12, Corbett Life Science). In the untreated cells, a Ct\nvalue was not always achieved so the final cycle (cycle 50)\nwas assigned as the Ct which tends to underestimate the\ndegree of upregulation. Traditional statistical analyses for\nquantitative PCR are not appropriate due to high variabil-\nity of gene expression in ex vivo human cells. Thus com-\nparative QRT-PCR statistics were obtained by a hypothesis\ntest with randomised bootstrapping of values with 50,000\niterations using the Relative Expression Software Tool\n(REST 2005, version 1.9.12, Corbett Life Science).\nAuthors' contributions\nGC designed and carried out the quantitative PCR, carried\nout survival assays, carried out IL-6 ELISA, performed sta-\ntistical analyses and wrote the manuscript.
