Here we use a rodent malaria model, Plasmodium berghei, to determine whether, and what proportion of cultured ookinetes show signs of apoptosis-like death and extend the study to examine ookinetes of Plasmodium falciparum in vivo. Results: Ookinetes displayed the following markers of PCD: loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, nuclear chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, translocation of phosphatidylserine to the outer surface of the cell membrane and caspase-like activity. The proportion of parasites expressing apoptosis markers rose with time, particularly when cultured in phosphate buffered saline. Some ookinetes positive for apoptosis markers also had compromised membranes, which could represent a late stage in the process. When these are included a similar proportion of ookinetes display each marker. Over 50% of P. falciparum ookinetes, removed from the mosquito midgut lumen 24 h post-infection, had nuclei containing fragmented DNA. Conclusion: We have confirmed previous reports that Plasmodium ookinetes display multiple signs that suggest they die by a mechanism resembling apoptosis.

However, reports that sexual and asexual stages\nof malaria parasites exhibit these markers have been challenged. Here we use a rodent malaria\nmodel, Plasmodium berghei, to determine whether, and what proportion of cultured ookinetes\nshow signs of apoptosis-like death and extend the study to examine ookinetes of Plasmodium\nfalciparum in vivo.\nResults: Ookinetes displayed the following markers of PCD: loss of mitochondrial membrane\npotential, nuclear chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, translocation of\nphosphatidylserine to the outer surface of the cell membrane and caspase-like activity. The\nproportion of parasites expressing apoptosis markers rose with time, particularly when cultured in\nphosphate buffered saline. Some ookinetes positive for apoptosis markers also had compromised\nmembranes, which could represent a late stage in the process. When these are included a similar\nproportion of ookinetes display each marker. Over 50% of P. falciparum ookinetes, removed from\nthe mosquito midgut lumen 24 h post-infection, had nuclei containing fragmented DNA.\nConclusion: We have confirmed previous reports that Plasmodium ookinetes display multiple\nsigns that suggest they die by a mechanism resembling apoptosis. This occurs in vivo and in vitro\nwithout experimental application of triggers. Our findings support the hypothesis that non-necrotic\nmechanisms of cell death evolved before the advent of multicellular organisms.\nBackground\nThe hypothesis that a protozoan parasite can undergo a\nform of programmed cell death (PCD) akin to apoptosis\nwas first proposed by Ameisen and colleagues in 1995 [1].\nSince then reports of unicellular eukaryotes displaying\nmarkers of PCD have been accumulating steadily and\nDeponte has recently pointed out that unicellular organ-\nism from all of the major eukaryote taxa bar one have\nPublished: 15 July 2009\nParasites & Vectors 2009, 2:32 doi:10.1186\/1756-3305-2-32\nReceived: 18 June 2009\nAccepted: 15 July 2009\nThis article is available from: http:\/\/www.parasitesandvectors.com\/content\/2\/1\/32\n\u00a9 2009 Arambage et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. \nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/2.0), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Page 1 of 16\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nParasites & Vectors 2009, 2:32 http:\/\/www.parasitesandvectors.com\/content\/2\/1\/32been shown to display one or more classical apoptotic\nmarker during cell death [2]. These organisms include two\nmuch studied models, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae\n[3] and the slime mould, Dictyostelium discoideum [4].\nAmongst the parasitic protists, the trypanosomatids have\nbeen the focus of most research on PCD [5-11], but PCD\nfeatures have also been recorded in;Toxoplasma gondii\n[12]; Blastocystis hominis [13]; in protozoans that do not\npossess mitochondria such as Giardia intestinalis, Tri-\nchomonas foetus and T. vaginalis [14,15]; and in P. berghei\nand P. falciparum [16,17].\nIncreasing knowledge of the morphological appearance\nand biochemical pathways of cell death in metazoans has\nled to an acceptance that the classification into necrosis,\napoptosis and autophagy is too simplistic and that, in\nsome circumstances, different aspects of these death path-\nways may be combined and stereotypic patterns do not\nalways apply [18]. The majority of the parasites listed\nabove display several independent morphological mark-\ners that are associated with typical mammalian apoptotic\nphenotypes, including the collapse of chromatin into con-\ndensed electron-dense masses; nuclear fragmentation; a\nchange in plasma membrane permeability and the pro-\nduction of apoptotic bodies. The accompanying biochem-\nical markers include a loss of mitochondrial membrane\npotential \u0394\u03c8m; cytochrome c release into the cytoplasm;\nactivation of caspase-like molecules; translocation of\nphosphatidylserine (PS) to the outer leaflet of the plasma\nmembrane; and DNA fragmentation [2,19,20]. Both bio-\nchemical and morphological markers can be detected in\nprotozoans that have been exposed to a variety of stressful\nstimuli including starvation; heat shock; incubation with\nnitric oxide donors or reactive oxygen species; and treat-\nment with staurosporine or anti-parasitic drugs. They also\noccur in stationary phase parasite cultures and in differen-\ntiating forms in vector insects [2,20]. However, there is\nconsiderable variation both in the kind and number of\nmarkers detected in different species and in which stimuli\ninduce which markers. In addition, features associated\nwith autophagy have also been described [21] and it is by\nno means clear whether PCD in parasitic protists should\nbe classified as apoptosis or whether new terminology is\nneeded.\nFew studies have so far been made of PCD in Plasmodium\nspp. and the majority of these have focussed on the eryth-\nrocytic stages of the human malaria, P. falciparum, where\nconflicting observations and conclusions have been made\n[2,17,22]. The occurrence of apoptosis-like cell death has\nalso been disputed in the rodent malaria P. berghei. Al-\nOlayan et al. [23,24] reported multiple features of apopto-\nsis-like cell death in ookinetes in vivo, in the mosquito\nmidgut lumen, and in vitro. In contrast, Le Chat and col-\nleagues [25] found no evidence for the occurrence of\nnuclear chromatin condensation or DNA fragmentation\nin P. berghei ookinetes grown in culture. In addition, they\nonly observed a very low number of ookinetes displaying\nphosphatidylserine translocation or activated caspase-like\nmolecules.\nIn view of this discrepancy in observations we have exam-\nined P. berghei ookinetes grown in culture to assess the\nproportion of a parasite population that displays multiple\nmorphological and biochemical markers that have been\nassociated with mammalian apoptosis. Changes in the\npercentage of parasites dying by an apoptosis-like process\nover time, and in different culture conditions, have been\nassessed. In contrast to most studies of PCD in protozoan\nparasites, no specific triggers have been used to induce cell\ndeath as it occurs naturally in our standard culture condi-\ntions. Our results confirm that several markers associated\nwith apoptotic cell death are displayed by ookinetes and\nthat the proportion of parasites exhibiting these markers\nincreases with time. In addition, we demonstrated that P.\nfalciparum ookinetes also undergo apoptosis in the mos-\nquito.\nResults\nMarkers for apoptosis\nCondensed chromatin\nAcridine orange staining of ookinetes, collected after incu-\nbating gametocytaemic blood for 18 h, demonstrated that\na proportion of the population contained nuclei with con-\ndensed chromatin. These proportions were highly varia-\nble from experiment to experiment and with time post-\nincubation (see Fig. 1 and 2). In a few cases fragmentation\nof the nucleus could be observed (Fig. 1C, D).\nFragmented DNA\nOokinetes collected at the same time as those used for\nacridine orange staining also displayed signs of DNA frag-\nmentation, as detected using a TUNEL assay (Fig 2: 48.55\n\u00b1 6.01%, 64.19 \u00b1 6.09% and 69.89 \u00b1 2.81% at 18, 22 and\n26 h post-incubation respectively). A negative control for\nthe TUNEL assay (without TdT enzyme) was conducted to\ndetect the amount of non-specific staining associated with\nthe assay, which would result in false positives. A propor-\ntion of ookinetes was positive for TUNEL staining in the\npresence of TdT and a much smaller proportion was\nstained in the absence of TdT, indicating that approxi-\nmately 10% of TUNEL positive ookinetes were non-spe-\ncifically stained and did not contain fragmented DNA.\nThis was not significantly different from controls at 18, 22\nand 26 h post-incubation (p = 0.8015, p = 0.7921, p =\n3.001 at 18, 22 and 26 h respectively).\nCaspase-like activity\nActivity of caspase-like molecules was detected using both\nFAM.VAD.fmk (green) and SR.DEVD.fmk (red) (Fig. 3). APage 2 of 16\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nParasites & Vectors 2009, 2:32 http:\/\/www.parasitesandvectors.com\/content\/2\/1\/32pilot study was conducted to determine the effect of incu-\nbation with FAM.VAD.fmk at the manufacturer's recom-\nmended temperature of 37\u00b0C compared to 19\u00b0C, a\ntemperature at which P. berghei ookinetes will develop\nsuccessfully. Ookinetes were collected at 22 h post-incu-\nbation, assayed for caspase-like activity and counter-\nstained with propidium iodide (PI) immediately prior to\nexamination to identify those with permeable mem-\nbranes. The experiment was repeated 6 times and 150\nookinetes examined each time. A significant increase\n(from 12.36 \u00b1 1.94% to 20.5 \u00b1 3.07%; p = 0.016) in the\nproportion of cells that had permeable membranes\noccurred when the assay was performed at 37\u00b0C, whereas\nthe proportion of ookinetes displaying caspase-like activ-\nity did not change (~42%). All subsequent CaspaTag\nassays were conducted at 19\u00b0C in case the death of some\nof the ookinetes scored positive at 37\u00b0C occurred due to\nthe inappropriate temperature used for the assay incuba-\ntion.\nIn cases where FAM.VAD.fmk was used together with PI,\nthe following grouping method was used consistently\nthroughout experiments. Ookinetes that did not show\ncaspase-like activity were considered live. Ookinetes that\nexpressed both caspase-like activity and intact cell mem-\nbranes (green) were categorised as early apoptotic ooki-\nnetes. The small proportion of ookinetes that showed\nboth caspase-like activity and loss of membrane integrity\nat the same time (green and orange) were grouped as late\napoptotic\/dying ookinetes.

Ookinetes with no labelling were considered live\nwhereas ookinetes that appeared orange throughout (PI\npermeable), with no annexin labeling, were considered\ndead. Some ookinetes were labelled yellow-red through-\nout the cytoplasm, had red nuclear staining and green\nlabeling of the outer surface of the cell (Fig 4E, F). The fate\nof these cells was uncertain. They could be ookinetes that\nhad developed compromised plasma membranes at a late\nstage of apoptosis; or they could represent cell with a com-\npromised cell membrane that had died by necrosis, in\nwhich annexin had penetrated the cell and labeled PS that\nwas still located on the inner surface of the plasma mem-\nbrane. In view of this uncertainty, ookinetes with this type\nof staining were not counted as being apoptotic (for\nexample; 16.23 \u00b1 4.19% annexin positive, 13.32 \u00b1\n0.727% annexin and PI positive and 14.87 \u00b1 2.55% PI\npositive ookinetes at 18 h post-incubation).\nMitochondrial membrane potential\nOokinetes were collected from ookinete medium after\nincubating gametocytaemic blood for 18 h and the pro-\nDetection of fragmented DNA in P. berghei ookinetesFigure 2\nDetection of fragmented DNA in P. berghei ookinetes.

The number of\nookinetes that did not contain orange fluorescent JC-1\naggregates in their mitochondrion, and thus exhibited\nmitochondria outer membrane permeability (MOMP)\nwas determined. This experiment was performed on dif-\nferent samples of ookinetes from those examined for\nother markers of apoptosis. A mean proportion of 34.38 \u00b1\n2.95% of ookinetes exhibited MOMP (mean of 3 experi-\nments, 100 ookinetes examined per experiment) (Fig. 5).\nSigns of apoptosis in P. falciparum ookinetes\nA total of 12 An. gambiae midguts were examined 24 h\npost-infection with P. falciparum. All midguts contained P.\nfalciparum ookinetes with numbers ranging from 18\u2013110\nper midgut (mean = 60.24 \u00b1 29.01), of which a mean of\n67.8% \u00b1 2.82 were TUNEL positive (see Fig. 6).\nA temporal profile of the expression of apoptosis markers\nOne problem that was encountered was how to classify\nookinetes that displayed markers for apoptosis but also\nhad compromised membranes. This was particularly\nproblematical for detection of PS translocation by\nannexin labelling, as discussed above. Thus, for the\nannexin label, PI positive cells were not regarded as apop-\ntotic. In contrast, staining for apoptotic markers was\nregarded as a positive indication of apoptosis for the other\ntests, regardless of whether the cell membrane was com-\npromised or not because conclusions regarding labeling\nwere not affected by PI influx.\nA temporal profile of the display of condensed chromatin\nand caspase-activity was constructed by removing aliquots\nfrom the ookinete\/PBS suspension at various time points\npost-blood collection. Overall both markers of apoptosis\nincreased significantly with time (F(4,10) = 37.42; p <\n0.001). Nuclear chromatin condensation and activation\nof caspase-like molecules were seen in 15.5 \u00b1 1.06 and\n17.0 \u00b1 2.12% of ookinetes respectively at 18 h (1 h post-\ncollection), and by 22 h and 26 h post-blood collection a\nsignificant increase in the proportion of ookinetes exhib-\niting both markers was observed (Tukey's pairwise com-\nparisons, acridine orange: p = 0.0113 and p = 0.0003 at 22\nand 26 hrs respectively; CaspaTag: p = 0.0075 and p =\n0.0002 at 22 and 26 hrs respectively; Fig. 7). There was no\nsignificant difference between the proportion of ookinetes\nexhibiting markers for nuclear condensation and those\nthat demonstrated activation of caspase-like molecules at\nany time point (2 way ANOVA, F(1,10) = 1.81, p = 0.208).\nThe proportion of ookinetes with compromised mem-\nbranes and no observable caspase staining (dead) was\nalso observed to rise over time but the rate of increase was\nnot as great as that observed with the markers of apopto-\nsis.\nIn addition, gametocytaemic blood samples were incu-\nbated at 19\u00b0C for 18, 22 or 26 h and immediately checked\nfor 4 markers of apoptosis, namely; nuclear chromatin\ncondensation (acridine orange), activation of caspase-like\nmolecules (CaspaTag), translocation of phosphatidylser-\nine (annexin V) and nuclear chromatin fragmentation\n(TUNEL). Ookinetes were incubated in supplemented\nRPMI (ookinete medium) throughout. A significant\nincrease in the proportions of ookinetes exhibiting mark-\ners of apoptosis was observed from 18 h (2 way ANOVA)\n(Fig. 8 and Table 1). Double the number of ookinetes\nwith condensed chromatin (34.5 \u00b1 1.76%) and activated\ncaspase-like molecules (30.15 \u00b1 2.14%) was observed at\n18 h compared to the previous experiments and a large\nvariation between experimental replicates occurred at\nalmost all time points. Overall significant differences were\nobserved between different markers of apoptosis (separat-\ning those with compromised membranes) (2 way\nANOVA, F(4,129) = 132.04; p = 0.001), and a significant\ninteraction was observed between both time and markers\n(F(8,129) = 2.96; p = 0.005). Tukey's paired comparisons\nshowed that the proportion of ookinetes with nuclear\nchromatin condensation increased significantly from 18\u2013\n22 h (p = 0.003). Likewise, the proportion of ookinetes\nwith fragmented DNA rose significantly between 18 and\n22 h (p = 0.0034). Although the proportion of TUNEL\npositive cells was expected to be similar to those positive\nfor acridine orange and CaspaTag, a higher proportion\nwas observed (acridine orange: 34.5 \u00b1 1.76%, CaspaTag:\n30.15 \u00b1 2.14% and TUNEL: 48.55 \u00b1 6.01% respectively at\n18 h), however in this analysis no account was taken of\npotential false positive results that we showed to be asso-\nciated with this assay. Compared to the other markers,\nannexin positive ookinetes remained at a lower level\n(19.57 \u00b1 1.88%, 28.33 \u00b1 5.61% and 30.12 \u00b1 2.75% at 18,\n22 and 26 h respectively) throughout the study, but these\nIdentification of mitochondria demonstrating loss of mem-bra e po entialFigure 5\nIdentification of mitochondria demonstrating loss of \nmembrane potential.

A further analysis was per-\nformed (a 2 way AVOVA) in which data from the TUNEL\nassay were adjusted to take account of the expected false\npositive results by subtracting 10% from each value and in\naddition, the proportion of ookinetes that were annexin\nand propidium iodide positive were added to the propor-\ntion displaying annexin alone (ie. The total proportion of\nookinetes displaying annexin labeling). When data were\nanalysed in this way there was no significant difference\nbetween the expression of any of the markers of apoptosis\nat any time point(F(3,24) = 2.16: p = 0.119) thus a similar\nproportion of ookinetes displayed each of the markers of\napoptosis at each time point.\nDiscussion\nThe hypothesis that apoptosis-like cell death occurs in\nPlasmodium species has been challenged as a result of con-\nflicting results observed by different research groups. With\nrespect to P. falciparum, differences in sensitivity to chlo-\nroquine treatment between different parasite strains has\nbeen suggested to be at the heart of these differences [26].\nTreatment of chloroquine sensitive (clone 3D7) P. falci-\nparum with the anti-malarial drug, chloroquine, was\nshown to induce DNA fragmentation in vitro, loss of mito-\nchondrial membrane potential and DNA fragmentation\n[26-28]. More evidence of markers such as nuclear chro-\nmatin condensation, caspase-like activity and loss of\nmitochondrial membrane potential were also reported in\nerythrocytic stages in P. falciparum isolate NF54 treated\nwith bilirubin [29]. However, Deponte and Becker [22]\nand Nyakeriga et al [30] reported that the chloroquine\nsensitive F32 strain of P. falciparum die by a non-apoptotic\ncell death because they found no evidence for nuclear\nDNA fragmentation or externalisation of PS to the outer\nsurface of the plasma membrane. Further, a chloroquine-\nresistant P. falciparum isolate, PSS1, showed no nuclear\nchromatin condensation or caspase-like activity, although\na very low percentage of TUNEL positive (5\u20139%) parasites\nand cytoplasmic vacuolation was observed [21].\nWith respect to P. berghei, the observation of multiple fea-\ntures of apoptosis-like cell death in ookinetes reported by\nAl'Olayan et al. [23] was not confirmed by Le Chat and\nOokinetes of Plasmodium falciparum assayed for fragmented DNAFigur  6\nOokinetes of Plasmodium falciparum assayed for fragmented DNA.

They\nwere unable to find evidence of ookinetes with condensed\nchromatin or fragmented DNA although they did detect a\nvery small proportion (~3%) of parasites displaying PS\ntranslocation and a similar proportion with activated cas-\npase-like activity after 21 h of culture which, in the case of\nthe latter, rose to ~14% at 24 h post-culture.\nHere we report that features of metazoan apoptosis, such\nas nuclear chromatin condensation, activation of caspase-\nlike molecules, nuclear DNA fragmentation and translo-\ncation of phosphatidylserine to the outer surface of the\nplasma membrane were again observed in P. berghei ook-\ninetes that had been grown in well-established culture\nconditions [31], and when incubated further in PBS\nalone. In addition, we demonstrated that MOMP occurred\nin approximately one third of P. berghei ookinetes after\nincubating gametocytaemic blood for 18 h.\nAlthough apoptosis-like cell death has been observed in\nthe blood cell stages of P. falciparum this is the first report\nof DNA fragmentation in P. falciparum ookinetes that had\ndeveloped in the mosquito midgut, suggesting that this\ntype of PCD is not confined to ookinetes of a rodent\nmalaria parasite.\nMitochondria play a key role in the induction of apoptosis\nin mammalian cells with the release of cytochrome c and\nsubsequent caspase activation following MOMP (e.g.\n[32,33]. However MOMP is not associated with apoptotic\npathways in all metazoans and the degree to which it is\nconserved remains to be determined [34]. Reports that\nMOMP and cytochrome c release occur during apoptosis\ninduction in the trypanosomatids [2,19] and that chloro-\nquine was shown to induce a significant \u0394\u03c8m collapse in a\ndose-dependent manner in P. falciparum [26] suggest it\nmay be part of an ancient cell suicide\/survival mechanism\n[35,36]. A link between MOMP and downstream apop-\ntotic pathways in Plasmodium still needs to be established.\nIn common with other protozoan parasites, a proportion\nof P. berghei ookinetes react positively with a general cas-\npase inhibitor (eg. 17.0 \u00b1 2.12% at 18 h).

The absence of cas-\npases from protozoan genomes calls into question the\ntarget of so called caspase-specific inhibitors [16] whose\nspecificity has been challenged [37]. Caspases belong to\nthe clan CD cysteine proteases, as do the metacaspases\n[38] which are under scrutiny as homologous proteases\nthat may be involved in apoptosis in unicellular eukaryo-\ntes (e.g. [26,39,40]). Meslin and colleagues [26] propose\na putative role for metacaspases in apoptosis in P. falci-\nparum but no evidence supports this hypothesis with\nrespect to P. berghei [25], and, in our hands, ookinetes in\nwhich the gene for the metacaspases PbMC1 [25] or\nPbMC2 had been disrupted exhibited apoptosis markers\nto the same degree as the wild-type (Arambage and Hurd,\nin preparation). Attempts to identify the cysteine pro-\ntease(s) that is binding to proprietary caspase inhibitors\nor being inhibited by a range of cysteine protease inhibi-\ntors [23] are ongoing.

Gametocytaemic blood was incubated at 19\u00b0C for varying times.

Although the nature of the assays for condensed\nchromatin and fragmented DNA make it impossible to\nsimultaneously determine the membrane integrity in ook-\ninetes displaying these markers of apoptosis, we were able\nto do so in the assays to detect PS translocation and the\nactivation of caspase-like molecules. In these cases, we\nfound a proportion of parasites displaying the marker for\napoptosis also had a compromised cell membrane. Loss\nof membrane integrity has been associated with late stages\nof apoptosis in mammalian cells, known as the necrotic\nphase of apoptosis [41], and has been recorded following\ninduction of apoptosis in the protozoan parasites Leish-\nmania spp. and T. cruzi (reviewed in [19]). As it was not\npossible to follow the progress of the appearance of apop-\ntotic features in an individual ookinete, we are not able to\nverify the timing of the loss of membrane integrity relative\nto other markers but propose that, here too, this may\noccur late in the process of dying (See Fig. 9). Interest-\ningly, Le Chat and colleagues [25] also reported that many\nookinetes staining positive for PS translocation and cas-\npase-like activity also had compromised membranes. This\nobservation left us with a dilemma: how to classify ooki-\nnetes that displayed markers for apoptosis but also had\ncompromised membranes? This was particularly prob-\nlematical for detection of PS translocation by annexin\nlabelling. Ookinetes that were annexin and PI positive\ncould have reached a late stage of apoptosis. Alternatively,\na compromised membrane may admit annexin into the\ncell thus staining PS that had not been translocated.\nTherefore, ookinetes with both annexin and propidium\niodide staining could be regarded either as late apoptotic\nor as having died by some other process. Annexin label-\nling was not seen in all cells stained with PI suggesting the\nformer is more likely than the latter. In the analysis of our\ntime-course studies we initially erred on the side of cau-\ntion and only included ookinetes with intact membranes\nin the data sets where PI staining was also conducted. This\nmay explain why a higher proportion of ookinetes appear\npositive for condensed chromatin and fragmented DNA\nthan the other apoptosis markers, as these counts could\ninclude ookinetes with compromised membranes.\nTUNEL assays are routinely used to detect fragmented\nDNA associated with apoptotic cells. The histochemical\nTUNEL assay used in this study relies upon a detection\nsystem based on streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase. Our\ncontrol for non-specific staining suggested that approxi-\nmately 10% of ookinetes scored positive may be false pos-\nitives. This would be an additional explanation for the\napparent detection of a higher proportion of ookinetes\npositive for DNA fragmentation than other markers of\napoptosis.

This demonstrated that\neach marker was displayed by a similar proportion of the\npopulation, thus suggesting that the morphological and\nbiochemical markers may all be linked in a process with\nan end result similar to apoptosis in metazoans,\nDeponte and Becker [22] suggested that methodological\npitfalls associated with different assays could cause differ-\nences in the detection of markers of apoptosis. We found\nit necessary to adapt apoptosis assays primarily designed\nfor use with mammalian cell lines. Incubation tempera-\nture was particularly important as sexual stages of P.\nberghei are highly temperature sensitive and produce no\nmidgut and salivary gland infections at 28\u00b0C or above\n[42], necessitating the routine culture of P. berghei ooki-\nnetes at 19\u201320\u00b0C. Differences in incubation tempera-\ntures, reagent concentrations or the use of kits from\ndifferent manufacturers may explain the inconsistency of\nresults obtained by different laboratories. We recommend\nthe use of several markers in future experiments on apop-\ntotic-like cell death in ookinetes.\nThe majority of work reported here was performed using\nP. berghei ookinetes that had developed in vitro. We\nwished to determine whether ookinetes of the human\nmalaria, P. falciparum were also capable of undergoing\napoptosis. Although P. falciparum ookinetes have been\nproduced in culture [43], this is not a technique that is\nroutinely successful. We therefore investigated P. falci-\nparum ookinete death ex vivo. In common with P. berghei\nookinetes taken from the mosquito midgut lumen [23],\nwe observed that a large proportion (~68%) of P. falci-\nparum ookinetes were dying by an apoptosis-like process\n24 h after the ingestion of gametocytes by mosquitoes,\nThis strengthens our hypothesis that conditions in the\nmidgut lumen are ultimately unfavorable for ookinete\nsurvival and a large proportion of the losses that occur\nbetween ookinete production and oocyst formation are\nthe result of cell suicide, and take place before the ooki-\nnete traverses the midgut epithelial cells [16].\nHaving examined ookinetes that develop from blood\nfrom a number of different mice we have become aware of\nlarge variations in the proportion of ookinetes displaying\nsigns of apoptosis at the same age (eg. nuclear chromatin\ncondensation and caspase-like activity at 18 h varied from\n15\u201335% and 15\u201330% respectively), and also a difference\nin the increase in this proportion as the ookinetes age. In\nparticular, we observed that at 18 h post-blood collection\nonwards those ookinetes from mice with parasitaemias\nabove 10% develop compromised membranes more\nquickly. At 18 h a higher proportion of ookinetes from\nmice with asexual parasitaemias below 10% display mark-\ners of apoptosis thus it is likely that many parasites from\nhighly infected mice have already progressed to late stages\nof apoptosis or are dead by 18 h (data not shown). It is\npossible that factors present in the blood of mice with\nhigh asexual parasitaemia act as triggers to induce ooki-\nnetes to die by an apoptosis-like pathway.\nThe proportion of apoptotic ookinetes rose more rapidly\nwith time when incubated in PBS, than when ookinetes\nremained in the nutrient rich ookinete medium. This may\nbe because there was a higher proportion of apoptotic\nookinetes at the start of monitoring this experiment (18\nh) compared with the previous one. Alternatively, the lack\nof nutrients in PBS, may have caused starvation-induced\napoptosis, as occurs in D. discoideum [44] and T. cruzi [1].\nIn contrast to the latter studies, Jimenez et al. [45] report\nthat serum deprivation induces autophagic characteristics\nsuch as monodansylcadaverine-labeled vesicle accumula-\ntion in T. cruzi. Menna-Barreto et al. [46] also reported\nautophagosome formation in T. cruzi, this time under\ndrug pressure, and suggest that evidence indicative of\napoptosis, autophagy and necrosis in T. cruzi are sugges-\ntive of cross talk between these three death pathways. The\nobservation of cytoplasmic vacuolation without evidence\nof DNA fragmentation when a chloroquine-resistant iso-\nlate of P. falciparum red blood cell stages was subjected to\ndrug and nitric oxide pressure led Totino and co-authors\n[21] to conclude that these parasites were dying by\nautophagy rather than apoptosis. In our study, we occa-\nsionally saw vacuolation in ookinetes at late stages of\napoptosis.\nOokinetes display the majority of Clarke's markers for\ntype 1 programmed cell death or apoptosis [47]. However\nit is becoming clear that pathways involved in cell death\nare not clear cut and that these processes are interlinked\n[18]. With respect to unicellular eukaryotes, trying to\nshoehorn observations into classifications designed for\nmulticellular organisms is clearly not the way forward.\nSome form of non-necrotic death is taking place in these\norganisms but, although outward signs are similar, molec-\nular pathways clearly differ as homologues of apoptosis-\ninducing factors and effector caspases regulating apopto-\nsis in metazoans have not been found [17]. The evolution\nof cell suicide mechanisms evidently predates the metazo-\nans [37]. We now need to search for novel induction and\nregulation pathways as well as explanations for a phe-Page 12 of 16\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nParasites & Vectors 2009, 2:32 http:\/\/www.parasitesandvectors.com\/content\/2\/1\/32nomenon that likely has a different function to that in the\nhigher eukaryotes.\nConclusion\nA proportion of P. berghei and P. falciparum ookinetes do\nshow markers similar to mammalian cells that are under-\ngoing apoptosis. These markers are expressed without\nexperimental exposure to drugs or other stressors and\nmust be a result of conditions present both in culture and\nin vivo. Several markers are displayed by a similar propor-\ntion of P. berghei ookinetes and this proportion increases\nwith time. Work is underway to identify the triggers that\ninduce this cell suicide.\nMaterials and methods\nOokinete growth and enrichment\nAll experiments were carried out in accordance with the\nUK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 using\napproved protocols. CD mice were infected with P. berghei\nANKA 2.34 and gametocytaemic blood collected by car-\ndiac puncture and incubated as described in Carter et al.\n[48] in ookinete medium composed of supplemented\nRPMI. Fertilized gametocytes developed into retort forms\nand then ookinetes in this medium. At various times from\n16 h post-incubation onwards, ookinetes were purified by\nseparation from erythrocytes using a MidiMacs (Miltenyi\nBiotec, Germany) separation column as described in\nCarter et al. [48,49] and used to assess the proportion that\nexhibited markers of apoptosis-like cell death.\nMarkers of apoptosis\nSamples of ookinetes from the same culture were divided\naccording to the experimental protocol and each sub-sam-\nple subjected to a different assay to identify different signs\nof programmed cell death as follows:\nDetection of nuclear chromatin condensation\nNuclear chromatin condensation was detected by staining\nookinetes suspended in 5 \u03bcl PBS with an equal volume of\nacridine orange (Sigma) at a working concentration of 2.5\n\u03bcg\/ml in PBS. After addition of ~0.5 \u03bcl of Vectashield\nmounting medium (Vector Laboratories Inc., Buringame,\nCanada), samples were immediately viewed under oil\nimmersion (\u00d71000) using a Leica inverted microscope\n(Leica Microsystems, Germany) with a filter suitable for\nfluorescein (450\/490 excitation; 515 emission). The\nnumber of ookinetes with condensed chromatin out of\none hundred from each sample was counted (unless oth-\nerwise specified). Results are expressed as % of ookinetes\nexhibiting positive staining.\nDetection of activated caspase-like molecules\nActive caspase-like molecules were detected using the\nCaspaTag fluorescence caspase activity kit (Chemicon\ninternational, USA) which contains the caspase inhibitor,\ncarboxyfluorescein-Val-Ala-Asp fluoromethylketone\n(FAM.VAD.fmk) which binds irreversibly to activated cas-\npases in 1:1 stoichiometry, thus detecting apoptotic cells.\nCaspase-like activity was also detected with sulphorhodo-\nminyl-Asp-Gly-Val-Asp-fluoromethylketone\n(SR.DEVD.fmk) but this was not used for time course\nstudies. Propidium iodide (PI) (250 \u03bcM\/mL) was used in\nsome of these assays to detect cells with permeabilised\nmembranes. Assays were performed according to the\nmanufacturer's instructions; except that incubations were\ncarried out at 19\u00b0C as a pilot study had shown that the\nplasma membrane of ookinetes incubated at 37\u00b0C rapidly\nbecame permeable to propidium iodide (PI). After addi-\ntion of 0.5 \u03bcl of Vectashield samples were observed under\noil immersion (\u00d71000) with a filter suitable for fluores-\ncein or rhodamine (515\u2013560 excitation; 580 emission)\nand the proportion of ookinetes with active caspase-like\nmolecules or signs of PI infiltration were recorded.\nDNA fragmentation assay\nDNA fragmentation was detected by TdT-FragEL\u2122 DNA\nfragmentation detection kit (TUNEL) (Calbiochem, UK).\nThe assay is based on binding of terminal deoxynucleoti-\ndyl transferase (TdT) to exposed 3'-OH ends of DNA frag-\nments, generated due to apoptotic signals. Ookinetes were\nfirst fixed in 4% methanol-free paraformaldehyde (Poly-\nscience Inc. Warrington, PA) for 10 mins and resuspended\nin 80% ethanol at a cell density of 1 \u00d7 105\/ml. Approxi-\nmately 10 \u03bcl of the suspension was dried onto each well\nof a multi-well slide and the assay was performed on the\nfixed ookinetes according to the manufacturer's instruc-\ntions. Samples were observed under bright light at \u00d71000\nmagnification. The position and shape of apoptotic nuclei\nwere confirmed by staining Vectashield containing 4',6-\ndiamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Vector Laboratories,\nCanada).\nSince the TUNEL reaction is based on a biotin-streptavi-\ndin-DAB detection system, a negative control was per-\nformed by removing TdT enzyme from the labelling\nreaction mixture to detect any non specific binding to\nendogenous peroxidases, resistant to the inactivation step\nin the protocol and acting on DAB to create the coloured\nproduct. Three replicates from the same sample at each\ntime point were subjected to TUNEL assay using this neg-\native control and compared with a sample assayed using\nthe complete reaction.\nTranslocation of phosphatidylserine to the outer leaflet of \nthe plasma membrane\nThis was detected using an Annexin V-FITC apoptosis\ndetection kit (Sigma, UK), which detects translocation of\nphosphatidylserine (PS), in the presence of Ca2+. The\nassay was conducted according to the manufacturer's\ninstructions except that incubations were performed forPage 13 of 16\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nParasites & Vectors 2009, 2:32 http:\/\/www.parasitesandvectors.com\/content\/2\/1\/3212 mins at 19\u00b0C. One microlitre of PI (as provided by the\nkit manufacturers) was added and the sample incubated\nagain for 3 mins. After addition of 0.5 \u03bcl of Vectashield,\nsamples were immediately observed using a FITC filter at\n\u00d71000. In cells regarded as apoptotic, the outer margin of\nthe ookinete was labelled bright, apple green and PI was\nexcluded.\nMitochondrial trans-membrane potential assay\nMitochondrial depolarisation was measured by a JC-1\nassay kit (Molecular Probes, UK). This includes a cationic\ndye which is known as 5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3' tetra-\nethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1). JC-1\nshows a potential-dependent accumulation in mitochon-\ndria. Loss of \u0394\u03c8m can be detected by the shifting of emis-\nsion of fluorescence from orange (polarised\nmitochondrial membrane) to green (depolarised mito-\nchondrial membrane). The assay was performed accord-\ning to the manufacturer's instructions using ~1 \u00d7 106\nookinetes\/1 ml. P. berghei ookinetes were enriched from\nookinete culture medium at 18 h and suspended in PBS.\nEach sample of 100 \u03bcl of ookinete suspension was then\nincubated with 1 \u03bcl of 200 \u03bcM JC-1 for 15\u201330 mins at\n19\u00b0C. Cells were washed once in PBS. After addition of\n0.5 \u03bcl of Vectashield, they were immediately observed\nusing a FITC filter.\nA temporal profile of the expression of apoptosis markers \nin vitro\nThe effect of age on the proportion of ookinetes undergo-\ning apoptosis was examined under two different culture\nconditions.\nIncubation in phosphate buffered saline\nBlood samples obtained from different mice were incu-\nbated in ookinete medium at 19\u00b0C for 17 h. Ookinete cul-\ntures were pooled and ookinetes purified, then pelleted,\nand resuspended in 2 ml PBS at an unknown density\nwhich varied from experiment to experiment, and incu-\nbated at 19\u00b0C. A temporal profile of ookinetes exhibiting\nmarkers of apoptosis was constructed by removing aliq-\nuots from the ookinete suspension at 18, 20, 22, 24, 26 h\npost-initial culture, and stained using acridine orange or\nCaspaTag as before. The total number of apoptotic ooki-\nnetes and dead cells\/100 ookinetes was detected under oil\nimmersion, \u00d71000 magnification, and the experiment was\nrepeated twice.\nIncubation in ookinete medium\nGametocytaemic P. berghei blood samples were incubated\nat 19\u00b0C in ookinete medium for 18, 22 and 26 h. Ooki-\nnetes were then assessed for 4 markers of apoptosis using\n4 different assays namely; acridine orange, CaspaTag,\nAnnexin V and the TUNEL assay. A proportion of ooki-\nnetes in the samples showed markers of apoptosis and\nhad permeabilised membranes at the same time. With the\nexception of Annexin V labeling, we regarded these as late\napoptotic ookinetes. The total number of apoptotic, late\napoptotic and dead cells\/150 ookinetes per sample were\ndetected. The experiment was repeated three times.\nDetection of apoptosis in ookinetes of Plasmodium \nfalciparum\nAs no reliable method for the development of P. falci-\nparum ookinetes in culture was available to us, ookinetes\nwere examined ex vivo to determine whether a proportion\nof this Plasmodium species also showed signs of apoptosis-\nlike death. P. falciparum clone 3D7 was cultured in vitro\nusing conditions permissive for the development of\nmature gametocytes infective to mosquitoes [50-52].\nAn. gambiae Keele strain mosquitoes were maintained in\nan insectary at 26 \u00b1 1\u00b0C at 70\u201380% relative humidity in a\n12:12 hour light\/dark cycle. Adult mosquitoes were given\nad libitum a 5% solution of 5% glucose\/0.05% para-\namino-benzoic acid, except for 24 h prior to a blood feed-\ning; only distilled water was provided at this time.\nFive to seven days after emergence from pupae, adult\nfemale An. gambiae were membrane-fed on uninfected\nhuman blood mixed with cultured asexual and gameto-\ncyte stages of P. falciparum according to standard proce-\ndures. Twenty four hours post-infection mosquitoes were\nkilled and guts removed immediately into 40 \u03bcl PBS. 10\n\u03bcl was diluted further with 30 \u03bcl or 70 \u03bcl PBS and then 10\n\u03bcl spotted on to a multi well slide. This gave 10 \u03bcl spots\nwith 1\/16th or 1\/32nd of a midgut, depending on the dilu-\ntion used. The slides were then air dried and fixed using\nalcohol free 4% formaldehyde, and then frozen at -80\u00b0C\nuntil subjected to a TUNEL assay.\nStatistical analysis\nAll data were analysed using Mintab\u00ae software (version\n13.1). Initially data was checked for normality (Anderson-\nDarling normality test) and equal variance (Bartlett's test)\nbefore analysis. Data that were normally distributed were\nthen analysed using 2-way ANOVA, non-normally distrib-\nuted data were first arcsin converted. Statistically signifi-\ncant data were further analysed using Tukey's test for\npaired comparisons. The effect of temperature on caspase\nactivity and viability of ookinetes was analysed using a 2\nsample t-test.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nSCA contributed to the design of the study, carried out all\nthe assays for apoptotic markers and statistical analysis in\nthe P. berghei study and assisted in drafting the manuscript.Page 14 of 16\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nParasites & Vectors 2009, 2:32 http:\/\/www.parasitesandvectors.com\/content\/2\/1\/32IP carried out the analysis of apoptosis in P. falciparum\nookinetes.
