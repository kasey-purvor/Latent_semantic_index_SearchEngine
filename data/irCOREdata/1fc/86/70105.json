This\nunderstanding will then be used to investigate intrusion detection tech-\nniques for operation specifically in a community environment.\n1 Introduction\nWireless mesh networks (WMNs) are becoming increasingly common, particu-\nlarly to provide network connectivity to communities where wired deployment\nstrategies are either not possible or are prohibitively expensive. The proliferation\nof \u2018off the shelf\u2019 mesh hardware and software [1, 2] has resulted in communi-\nties creating wireless mesh networking installations themselves where previously\nthey might not have possessed the understanding or technical skill. These fac-\ntors combined with the many potential issues which might occur throughout the\noperation of a wireless mesh have led to a requirement for increased resiliency,\nenabling the network to resolve and remediate against problems as and when\nthey arise without the need for external technical understanding or input.\nResilience in this context can be thought of as the aim to provide an accept-\nable level of service when challenges to network operation occur, whatever the\nadverse event or condition might be [3]. A resilience strategy to address potential\nproblems has been developed as part of the EU FP6 ANA Project \u2013 D2R2+DR.\nThis consists of two ongoing phases, firstly (D2R2) Defence against potential\nchallenges and Detection of their presence as and when they occur, Remediation\nof the effects and eventual Recovery of the system back to normal operation.\n2 Sara Bury and Nicholas J. P. Race\nSecondly, (DR) consists of Diagnosis and Refinement of the system based on the\nresults of previous first phase iterations.\nWMNs are intended to be resilient by design. Their infrastructure is cre-\nated using a combination of wireless networking technology and ad-hoc routing\nprotocols to create a self-managing network in which all nodes act as routers\n[5], able to route traffic either directly or via a multi-hop path. Unfortunately,\nwhilst WMNs are considered to be functional the technology and protocols be-\nhind these mechanisms are still relatively new and research is ongoing to improve\ntheir dependability and efficiency [4]. Security is a necessary facet of resiliency\nin wireless mesh networking; resilient routing protocols and autonomous config-\nuration can only go so far if these processes can be abused by attackers. Due to\nthis security has been chosen as the main focus of this research.\n2 The Research Problem\nThe specific scenario being investigated is that of community wireless mesh net-\nworking \u2013 situations where mesh networking technology has been introduced\ninto a community environment, rather than through any commercial applica-\ntion, and where it is operated by the users themselves. An example of this is\nthe situation at Wray, a small rural village in the North West of England. In\n2003, members of the community approached academics at Lancaster University\nsearching for a solution to their lack of broadband Internet access. The result\nwas the deployment of a WMN throughout the village with nodes owned and\nhosted by individual members of the community, making available an Internet\nconnection fed into the local school via a 5.8Ghz radio link [6]. In this situation,\nthough the University has access to use the network for research purposes, the\nvillagers themselves oversee and operate the network on a daily basis and users\nwith a range of expertise and computer literacy have responsibility and control\nover how the network runs. The resilience of the network is incredibly important.\nIn many cases the users rely on the network as their sole method of access to\nthe Internet, but they lack the technical experience and knowledge of computer\nnetworking to manually fix problems if they arise.\nFor generic network security there are goals which applications aim to achieve:\nconfidentiality, integrity, availability, authentication, authorisation and account-\nability - in a WMN there are specific challenges to these goals over and above\nthose found in more conventional wired networks. The shared wireless medium\nexists such that any one with suitable wireless hardware has the ability to listen\nto traffic on the network, launch jamming attacks to deny network functionality,\nor even to send out malicious control traffic to other routing nodes [7]. Also, a lack\nof physical protection for the mesh nodes themselves could result in legitimate\nmesh infrastructure becoming compromised; this is emphasised by the nature of\nubiquitous access within a community mesh, all members of the community are\noffered network access, but with no specific assurance that attackers won\u2019t come\nfrom within the community group, potentially hosting the infrastructure they\nhave compromised. In a community WMN scenario, attack vectors can occur\nTowards Resilient Community Wireless Mesh Networks 3\nexternally and internally to the network infrastructure and this results in an\nextremely wide scope of potential attacks to combat. Another factor alongside\nthis is the diversity of needs, requirements and backgrounds within the com-\nmunity. A single community group may contain home users, small businesses,\npeople making use of the network for educational purposes and so on, all with\ndifferent understandings of what the network provides and what functionality is\nmost important to them. Also each of these users may have particular security\nrequirements, for stored data or important communications.\nWithout a clear idea of these requirements, the security needs for the network\nare both vague and wide in scope. This makes the development of a security\nstrategy for use in this scenario incredibly difficult. An understanding of the uses,\npriorities, and necessary services would substantially aid the creation of security\nsystems, procedures, and policies by narrowing the problem space involved.\n3 Chosen Approach\nIn order to gain an insight into the utilisation of the network and the require-\nments of individual users, we need to understand from the perspective of the\nusers themselves what they consider to be their most important assets and what\nthey feel are most vulnerable to attack. The concept of risk analysis within com-\nputer networking is not new; there are many tried and tested frameworks for the\nassessment of such factors, particularly within enterprise scale networks used\nfor businesses or academia. Examples include the OCTAVE risk based strategic\nassessment process [8], or STRIDE, a practice for computer security threat mod-\nelling [9]. Unfortunately due to the distinct operational nature and requirements\nof community mesh networks, such proven formalised methods are not directly\napplicable. Other work in the area of mesh network resilience has often focussed\non specific perceived threats, from low level protocol improvements to hardware\nsolutions for increased link availability; little work has been carried out which\ntakes the opinions and concerns of the mesh users into account when identifying\nthreats to resilience. This research intends to apply risk analysis techniques in a\ncommunity wireless mesh network setting, with the aim identifying the most im-\nportant risks for the users from their own perspective, what assets exist and are\nmost appealing to an attacker, and the weighted probability of the occurrence\nof types of attack aimed at specific assets.\nThis approach has been chosen firstly because of the benefits of being able\nto narrow down the attack vectors present in a WMN, but secondly to investi-\ngate whether risk analysis techniques can be formalised for use in similar situa-\ntions. Such a formalised process would enable community users of mesh networks\nto perform risk analysis themselves, looking for ways to improve their security\nwithout involving external consultants. The process of consulting members of\nthe community about their own security concerns also fits well with the way\nthat community WMNs operate \u2013 everyone having a hand in their continued\nfunctionality and contributing to the project as a whole.\n4 Sara Bury and Nicholas J. P. Race\nBefore involving network users in the project, certain decisions must be made\nregarding the suitability of particular risk analysis techniques and assumptions\nwithin this community scenario. For example, the concept of an \u2018asset\u2019 is likely\nto be different when compared with an enterprise setting \u2013 users may consider\nthe safety of their children on the Internet of the utmost importance, whereas\nwithin a company employees would be expected to in many respects look after\nthemselves. The community risk analysis will be carried out through small focus\ngroups and discussion sessions with real world users, using carefully selected\nscenarios and lines of questioning to help explain the project. The research is in\nits preliminary stages and over the course of the next year sessions are planned\nwith members of the community at Wray.\n4 Conclusion\nResiliency in WMNs is a complex area and security is a critical factor. This\nresearch aims to improve the resilience of WMNs by examining improvements in\nthe area of security. Firstly by reducing the problem space involved, then leading\nto the development of a security strategy with relevant and appropriate security\nsystems for use in community WMNs. In order to reduce the problem space, a\nbreakdown of assets and risks from the perspective of community WMN users\nwill be produced; the process of creating which should indicate the feasibility\nof formalising this risk analysis procedure for users themselves to carry out\nas a community project. This information will be used to narrow down the\nnumber of attack vectors necessary to anticipate, prevent and detect in the\ntarget development of an IDS to demonstrate the functionality in a community\nWMN environment.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors are grateful to the resilient networking group for their work in\ndeveloping the D2R2+DR resilience strategy, which will guide this work.
