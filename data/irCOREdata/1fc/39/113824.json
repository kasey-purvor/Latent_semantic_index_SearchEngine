These non-\nvisual effects include the synchronization of the circadian system,\nsuppression of melatonin, regulation of sleep, as well as\nimprovements of alertness and cognition [1\u20136]. We have shown\nthat nonvisual responses related to alertness and cognition are\nassociated with changes in regional brain activity detected by\npositron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic\nresonance imaging (fMRI) [7\u20139]. A number of recent studies,\nusing a wide variety of methodologies, revealed that acute or\nlonger term human nonvisual responses are most sensitive to\nmonochromatic light of wavelengths between ,460 and 480 nm\n[2\u20136,9\u201314]. This sensitivity is much shorter than the overall\nmaximum sensitivity of the photopic system (,555 nm), and does\nnot coincide with the maximum sensitivity of any of the individual\nclassical photoreceptors (rods: ,505 nm; S-cones: ,430 nm; M-\ncones: ,530 nm; L-cones: 560 nm) [15,16].\nA fifth retinal photopigment, melanopsin, was recently discov-\nered [17] and shown to be expressed in retinal ganglion cells\n(RGC) that are intrinsically light sensitive [18], with a maximum\nsensitivity between 420 to 480 nm [19\u201321]. Melanopsin-expres-\nsing RGC are implicated in nonvisual responses to light [18,22].\nThey project to numerous brain structures in rodents [23,24],\nincluding hypothalamic nuclei such as the suprachiasmatic nucleus\n(SCN) and the ventrolateral preoptic area (VLPO), as well as many\nnon-hypothalamic structures including the olivary pretectal\nnucleus (OPN), and amygdala. Melanopsin-expressing RGC also\nproject to areas typically involved in vision such as the lateral\ngeniculate nucleus (LGN) and the superior colliculus. In addition,\nmelanopsin-expressing RGC project to the LGN and OPN\nin Macaques [25]. These neuroanatomical pathways provide\na mechanism by which irradiance changes could affect many brain\nfunctions, i.e. circadian entrainment, pupillary constriction,\narousal, attention, and emotion regulation, as well as vision [2\u2013\n4,8,10,13,25,26]. However, classical visual photoreceptors are\nnecessary to induce complete nonvisual responses to light [27]. In\naddition, RGC which do not express melanopsin, and presumably\nare not intrinsically photosensitive, project to the SCN, inter-\ngeniculate nuclei (IGL) of the thalamus, and VLPO, suggesting\nthat signal arising from the classical retinal photoreceptors reaches\nthese structures [24,28]. The relative contribution of the different\nretinal photoreceptors has not been fully assessed.\nRod and cone responses to light are typically time-locked to the\nexposure, i.e. responses start and cease within a few ms after light is\nturned on and off, respectively. In addition, quick attenuation of\nrod and cone signals occurs in the presence of a constant light\nstimulus [25]. Intrinsic light responses of the melanopsin-\nexpressing RGC are much more sluggish and do not show\nAcademic Editor: Sheng He, University of Minnesota, United States of America\nReceived June 23, 2007; Accepted November 3, 2007; Published November 28,\n2007\nCopyright: \u0001 2007 Vandewalle et al.

However,\nmelanopsin-expressing RGC receive extrinsic inputs from rods\nand the three classes of cones, which enable melanopsin-expressing\nRGC to instantaneously respond to light exposure, and suggest an\nimportant role for rods and cones in the nonvisual response to light\nearly in the exposure [25]. Accordingly, assessment of the relative\nefficacy of different wavelengths indicates that M-cones contribute\nimportantly to the initiation of the response in rodents, but later\nthe melanopsin-expressing RGC are the dominant contributor\n[13]. Similarly, at lower irradiance classical photoreceptors are\nsufficient to drive pupillary constriction in rodents while, at higher\nirradiance, melanopsin-expressing RGC are required to induce\na full response [29]. In addition, the wavelength sensitivity of rat\nSCN neuronal responses to light flashes suggests a contribution of\nrods and all cones to brief light exposures [30].\nA role for S-cones in nonvisual responses in humans was\ninferred from data showing a greater increase in subjective\nalertness under violet light exposure (420\u2013440 nm) [31]. However,\nmost human studies investigating the mechanisms of nonvisual\nresponses to light employed monochromatic exposures stimulating\nmost melanopsin-expressing RGC or M- and L-cones, but not S-\ncones [2,4,5,9]. S-cone contribution to nonvisual responses to light\nusing violet light preferentially triggering these photoreceptors\nremains to be firmly established. In addition, nonvisual responses\nto different wavelengths in humans have only been characterized\nafter relatively long duration exposures (at least tens of minutes),\ni.e. presumably after substantial attenuation of rod and cone\nsignals. Thus, the relative contributions of blue, violet and green\nlights, and by inference of melanopsin-expressing RGC, S- and M-\ncones, in the establishment of nonvisual responses to light have not\nbeen assessed in humans.\nBesides the known projections of melanopsin-expressing and\nnon-melanopsin-expressing RGC to brain structures involved in\nnonvisual functions, most of the brain mechanisms and pathways\nmediating nonvisual responses to light exposure are unknown. In\nrodents, the SCN and thalamic IGL receive light irradiance\ninformation almost directly and appear therefore to be strongly\nimplicated in eliciting nonvisual responses to light [32,33]. The\nSCN and IGL project to many brain structures involved in arousal\nregulation [33,34] and a functional indirect connection between\nthe SCN to the brainstem locus coeruleus (LC) has been\nestablished [35]. This SCN -brainstem projection may be the\npathway by which light modulates alertness. However, beyond\nthese candidate subcortical and brainstem structures, the brain\nmechanisms involved in generating physiological or behavior\nnonvisual responses to light have not been characterized in\nanimals.\nIn humans, using PET and fMRI, we have identified neural\ncorrelates of the alerting effects of a bright white light exposure\n(.7000lux), delivered at night or during the day in brain areas\nsuch as the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), hippocampus, thalamic\npulvinar, insula, and hypothalamus [7,8]. More recently we\ndemonstrated that brain activity related to a working memory task\nis maintained (or even increased) by blue (470 nm) mono-\nchromatic light exposure, whereas it decreases under green\n(550 nm) monochromatic light exposure [9]. These effects were\ndetected in areas implicated in working memory such as the\nthalamus, insula, IPS, supramarginal gyrus, and middle frontal\ngyrus (MFG). However, these studies were carried out using\nrelatively prolonged light exposures (17 to 21 min). The brain\nareas first affected by light exposure, and by inference involved in\nestablishing nonvisual responses to light, are therefore largely\nunknown in humans.\nIn the present study we used fMRI to specifically assess early\neffects of light over the entire brain while participants were\nperforming an auditory working memory task. We used alternat-\ning violet (430 nm), blue (473 nm), or green (527 nm) mono-\nchromatic light exposures of equal photon density to investigate\nthe processing of stimuli preferentially triggering S-cones,\nmelanopsin-expressing RGC, or M-cones, respectively. Light\nexposures lasted 50 s, a very short duration from a human\ncircadian biology perspective. We hypothesized that such short\nduration exposures would induce sustained modulation of the\nbrain responses related to the blocks of the task performed, and\nthat these modulations were wavelength-dependent. This would\nallow insight in the relative contributions of the different retinal\nphotoreceptors early on in the establishment of nonvisual\nresponses to light. On such a short time scale it is difficult to\nestablish whether the detected brain activity modulations consti-\ntute nonvisual or visual responses. This, however, is not essential\nfor our aim, which was to identify brain mechanisms involved in\nestablishing responses to light exposures which eventually will lead\nto nonvisual responses such as changes in cognition and alertness.\nWe also hypothesized that such short exposures would not induce\nwavelength-specific responses in a large number of brain areas but\nwould mainly affect a few areas involved in the establishment of\nthe responses, presumably subcortical and brainstem areas. The\nresults support our hypotheses and suggest a prominent role of\nmelanopsin-expressing RGC in the establishment of brain\nresponses to light.\nMETHODS\nSubjects\nParticipants were healthy, young subjects (N= 15; 8 females; age:\n19\u201327 [median: 22]; BMI: 18.7\u201327.3 [median: 22.2]). A semi-\nstructured interview established the absence of medical, traumatic,\npsychiatric, or sleep disorders. Absence of color blindness was\nassessed by the 38 plate edition of Ishihara\u2019s Test for Color-\nBlindness (Kanehara Shupman Co., Tokyo, Japan). All partici-\npants were non-smokers, moderate caffeine and alcohol con-\nsumers, and were not on medication. None had worked on night\nshifts during the last year or traveled through more than one time\nzone during the last 2 months. Extreme morning and evening\ntypes, as assessed by the Horne-Ostberg Questionnaire [36], were\nnot included. None complained of excessive daytime sleepiness as\nassessed by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale [37], or of sleep\ndisturbances as determined by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index\nQuestionnaire [38]. All participants had normal scores on the 21\nitem Beck Anxiety Inventory [39] and the 21 item Beck\nDepression Inventory II [40]. They were right-handed as\nindicated by the Edinburgh Inventory [41]. Participants gave\ntheir written informed consent and received a financial compen-\nsation for their participation. The study was approved by the\nEthics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of\nLie`ge.\nVolunteers followed a regular sleep schedule during the 7-day\nperiod preceding the laboratory segment of the experiment.\nCompliance to the schedule was assessed using wrist actigraphy\n(Actiwatch, Cambridge Neuroscience, UK) and sleep diaries. In\norder to record 2 volunteers on the same day at approximately the\nsame circadian time, volunteers were requested to follow one of 2\nsleep schedules differing by 1.5h (2300 h\u20130700 h +\/2 30 min, or\n0030 h \u2013 0830 h +\/2 30 min). Volunteers were requested to\nrefrain from all caffeine and alcohol-containing beverages and\nBrain Responses to Light\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 November 2007 | Issue 11 | e1247\nintense physical activity for 3 days before participating in the\nstudy.\nProtocol\nSubjects were first maintained in dim light (,5 lux) for 2h and\nthen scanned during three consecutive 20 min sessions (Figure 1a).\nThree drops of tropicamidum 0.5% (TropicolH) were administered\nin the eyes 20 min before entering the scanner to inhibit pupillary\nconstriction. In each session, subjects were alternatively exposed to\nmonochromatic 50s light exposures separated by 5-to-14s periods\nof darkness (,0.01 lux) (Figure 1b). Monochromatic light was\nviolet (430 nm), blue (473 nm), or green (527 nm) and aimed\nprimarily at S-cones, melanopsin-expressing RGC, and M-cones\nrespectively. In each session two wavelengths were presented and\nalternated. Each color was presented ten times per session.\nSubjects were exposed to the three possible combinations of\nwavelengths over the three sessions. The order of the combinations\nand the wavelength of the first light exposure in each combination,\nwere counter-balanced over subjects (Supplemental Table S1). In\naccordance with other protocols in this research area, the photon\ndensities of all light exposures were identical to allow the\nassessment of the relative contribution of the photoreceptors most\nsensitive to each wavelength. Photon density was set at 1013\nphotons\/cm2\/s because, at this level, nonvisual responses at night\nand during the day, depend on the wavelength of the light\nexposure [2\u20136,9,11,12,42]. This photon density was equivalent to\nan illumination level of 4, 7.5, and 24.5 photopic lux for violet,\nblue and green light exposure, respectively. The first light exposure\noccurred approximately 4h after habitual wake up time, i.e. during\nthe biological day when melatonin secretion is low [1]. During\neach session, participants performed an auditory 2-back working\nmemory task [43], which is reliably executed by a majority of\nsubjects and does not explicitly depend on visual input. Subjective\nalertness scores, as assessed by the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale\n(KSS) [44], were collected every 30 min during the 2h preparatory\nperiod and between each session while in the scanner.\nDuring the data acquisition period, all subjects interacted with\nthe same investigator who used a standardized set of sentences\nbetween each session. This protocol was implemented in order to\nminimize variation in motivational state due to social interactions\n[e.g. encouragement by an investigator which may modify brain\nresponses [45]]. No feedback was given on performance.\nVolunteers were trained on a shortened version of the protocol\nand habituated to the experimental conditions at least a week\nbefore the experiment. Subjects had to reach 75% of correct\nresponses on the 2-back task at the end of training to participate to\nthe experiment.\n2-back-task\nStimuli consisted of nine French monosyllabic consonants that\nwere phonologically different so that they could easily be\nidentified. Stimuli were 500 ms long and the inter-stimulus-\ninterval was 2500 ms. For each consonant, volunteers were\nrequested to state whether or not it was identical to the consonant\npresented 2 stimuli earlier, by pressing a button on a MR\ncompatible keypad for \u2018\u2018yes\u2019\u2019, and another one for \u2018\u2018no\u2019\u2019. Series of\nstimuli were constructed with ,30% positive answers. Fourteen\nconsonants were presented in each illumination period for a total\nof 35s, and 2 to 5 consonants were presented in half of the\ndarkness periods, for a total of 5 to 12.5s. Series could therefore be\n33 consonant long if a darkness period with the task was placed\nbetween 2 consecutive illumination periods where the task was\nperformed. Series were presented only once and were randomly\nassigned to one of the scanning sessions. Rest periods could last up\nto 44 s if a rest period in darkness was placed between two\nconsecutive illumination rest periods. Stimuli were produced using\nCOGENT 2000 (http:\/\/www.vislab.ucl.ac.uk\/Cogent\/) imple-\nmented in MATLAB (Mathworks Inc., MA) on a 2.8 GHz XEON\nDELL personal computer (Round Rock, TX) and were trans-\nmitted to the subjects using MR CONTROL amplifier and\nheadphones (MR Confon, Germany). The first session was\npreceded by a short session during which volunteers had to set\nthe volume level to ensure an optimal auditory perception during\nscanning.\nLight exposure\nNarrow interference band-pass filters (Full Width at Half\nMaximum [FWHM]: 10nm; Edmund Optic, UK) were used to\nproduce the three monochromatic illuminations. A filter wheel\n(AB301-T, Spectral Products, NM) was computer controlled to\nswitch band-pass filters and thereby change light wavelength. The\nlight was transmitted by a metal-free optic fiber from a source\n(PL900, Dolan-Jenner Industries, MA) to two small diffusers\nplaced in front of the subjects\u2019 eyes. The diffusers were designed\nFigure 1. Experimental design. a. General timeline. Time relative to scheduled wake time (hrs).

Light was administered through\na 465.5 cm frame placed 3 cm away from the eye. Spectra of each\nmonochromatic light were checked at the level of the diffusers\n(AvaSpec-2048, Avantes, The Netherlands), and the 430 nm,\n480 nm and 532 nm band-pass filters used produced light with\na maximum radiance at respectively 430.3 nm, 472.8 nm and\n527.3 nm. Irradiance could not be measured directly in the\nmagnet, but the light source was calibrated and irradiance\nestimated to be 1013 photons\/cm2\/s (840-C power meter,\nNewport, Irvine, CA) after prereceptoral lens absorption for the\ndifferent wavelengths was taken into account [46]. The total\namount of blue light received during the experiment was well\nbelow the blue-light hazard threshold [47].\nIn order to un-correlate task and light onsets, the auditory task\nwas performed during 35 s of the 50 s illumination periods. Half of\nthe illuminations started with 15 s of rest, the other half terminated\nwith 15 s rest periods. In addition, a 0-to-1 s jitter was\nimplemented between light onset\/offset and task onset\/offset\nwhen they occurred simultaneously in order to further un-\ncorrelate them. Darkness periods (,0.01 lux) separated all 50 s\nilluminations. The auditory task was performed during half of the\ndarkness periods, the duration of which were then 5 to 12.5 s. Rest\nwas requested during the other half; in which case darkness was\nlasting 9 to 14 s. Illuminations with one color were always followed\nby darkness periods and then by illuminations in the other color of\nthe session.\nBehavioral data analysis\nAccuracy scores were always very high, so we computed d-prime\nand criterion values following the signal detection theory [48] in\norder to identify possible changes in behavior not reflected in\noverall accuracy. Repeated measure ANOVA with light condition\nand session as within subject factors were carried out separately on\nd-prime, criterion and reaction times. Repeated measures\nANOVA with repetition as within subject factor were computed\non subjective sleepiness scores. All behavioral analyses were\ncomputed with Statistica 6.1 (StatSoft France, France).\nFunctional MRI data acquisition\nFunctional MRI time series were acquired using a 3T MR scanner\n(Allegra, Siemens, Germany). Multislice T2*-weighted fMRI\nimages were obtained with a gradient echo-planar sequence using\naxial slice orientation (32 slices; voxel size: 3.463.463 mm3;\nmatrix size 64664632; repetition time= 2130 ms; echo\ntime= 40 ms; flip angle = 90u). The four initial scans were\ndiscarded to allow for magnetic saturation effects. There was little\nvariation in the number of scans per session (blue-green sessions:\n563.365.9 (mean6SD); violet-blue sessions: 563.466.2; green-\nviolet sessions: 563.367.5). Head movements were minimized\nusing a vacuum cushion. A structural T1-weigthed 3D MP-RAGE\nsequence (TR 1960 ms, TE 4.43 ms, TI 1100 ms, FOV\n2306173 cm2, matrix size 25662566176, voxel size:\n0.960.960.9 mm) was also acquired in all subjects.\nFunctional MRI data analysis\nFunctional volumes were analyzed using Statistical Parametric\nMapping 5 (SPM5-http:\/\/www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk\/spm) implemen-\nted in MATLAB. They were corrected for head motion, spatially\nnormalized (standard SPM5 parameters) to an echo planar\nimaging template conforming to the Montre\u00b4al Neurological\nInstitute (MNI) space, and spatially smoothed with a Gaussian\nKernel of 8 mm FWHM. The analysis of fMRI data, based on\na mixed effects model, was conducted in two serial steps,\naccounting respectively for fixed and random effects. For each\nsubject, changes in brain regional responses were estimated using\na general linear model in which the different parts of the\nexperimental design were modeled using either boxcar or stick\nfunctions, convolved with a canonical haemodynamic response\nfunction. Boxcar functions modeled the 15 s rest illumination\nperiods, the 35 s illumination periods including the 2-back task,\nand the darkness periods during which the task was performed.\nStick functions modeled light onsets and light offsets. Melanopsin-\nexpressing RGC do not cease firing at light offset [25], so brain\nresponses to light offsets are unlikely to represent a nonvisual\nresponse to light. Further, rest periods during the illuminations\nwere short as compared to the task periods and were contaminated\nby the performance of the task. The regressors modeling offsets\nand rest periods were therefore considered as covariates of no\ninterest together with movement parameters derived from re-\nalignment of the functional volumes. High-pass filtering was\nimplemented in the matrix design using a cut-off period of\n256 seconds to remove low frequency drifts from the time series.\nSerial correlations in the fMRI signal were estimated using an\nautoregressive (order 1) plus white noise model and a restricted\nmaximum likelihood algorithm. The effects of interest were then\ntested by linear contrasts, generating statistical parametric maps.\nThe summary statistic images resulting from these different\ncontrasts were then further smoothed (6mm FWHM Gaussian\nKernel) and entered in a second-level analysis. This second step\naccounts for inter-subject variance in the main effects of light\ncondition (random effects model) and corresponds to a one-sample\nt-test for brain responses to the 2-back series and light onsets. The\nresulting set of voxel values for each contrast constituted maps of\nthe t statistics thresholded at puncorrected=0.001. Statistical inferences\nwere performed after correction for multiple comparisons on small\nspherical volumes (svc; 10 mm radius) at a threshold of psvc = 0.05,\naround a priori locations of activation. Activations were expected in\nstructures involved the n-back tasks, arousal regulation, and\nshowing nonvisual responses to light in our own fMRI and PET\nwork. Brain areas to which the melanopsin-expressing RGC\nproject or functionally linked to the SCN, were also considered as\na priori locations of activation. Standard stereotactic coordinates of\npreviously published a priori locations, used for svc, are as follow:\namygdala: 22 26 215 [49]; hippocampus: 230 230 22 [8];\nLGN: 223 221 23 [50]; LC: 2 232 220 [51]; thalamus: 214\n214 216 [9].\nRESULTS\nBehavior\nAll sessions and light conditions were identical from a behavioral\npoint of view. Statistical analyses showed that performance\n(reaction times and accuracy) was always high and was not\naffected by the light condition or sessions (Supplemental Data S1;\nFigure S1a\u2013c). Computation of subjective sleepiness scores\nrevealed that entering the scanner and the associated change in\nposture, significantly increased sleepiness. However, bias associat-\ned with variations in sleepiness was prevented by the pseudo-\nrandomization of session types (Supplemental Data S1; Figure\nS1d\u2013f).\nFMRI data\nSustained effects The analysis of fMRI data first focused on\nthe brain responses recorded during the blocks of the 2-back task.\nThe effects described below are therefore sustained because they\ndescribe differences between light conditions that were maintained\nBrain Responses to Light\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 November 2007 | Issue 11 | e1247\nfor the duration of the blocks. Significant differences between\nviolet and blue light exposures were detected in the left MFG and\nin the left thalamus, a few mm away from the location for which\nwe previously found a wavelength dependent effect of light [9], as\nwell as in two areas of the brainstem. Spatial resolution of the\nfMRI technique does not allow a precise identification of the\nbrainstem nuclei included in the activated areas, but the location\nof the activations is compatible with several pontine nuclei\ninvolved in arousal regulation, and in particular with the LC\nbilaterally (Figure 2; Table 1) [52]. Activity estimates show\n(Figure 2; right panels) that, compared to the violet light condition,\nresponses were greater under the blue exposure in these four brain\nareas. No significant differences between blue and green light\nexposures, and between violet and green light exposures were\ndetected during task periods (Supplemental Tables S2). Additional\nanalyses suggested that the differences between light conditions\nwere stable during the 50s illuminations (Supplemental Method\nS1; Supplemental Tables S3).\nTransient effects Two monochromatic light exposures were\ninitiated 10 times in each session. This number of events was\nsufficient to conduct an analysis on the transient brain responses\ntriggered by the onsets of the different light exposures. Significant\ndifferences between responses to blue and green light onsets were\nobserved in two limbic areas, the left hippocampus and right\namygdala, and in a location in the left thalamus, which was\nidentical to that identified in the analysis of the sustained brain\nresponses (Figure 3; Table 2). Activity estimates (Figure 3, right\npanels) show that these three brain areas strongly responded to\nblue light onsets while their activity was barely affected by green\nlight onsets. No significant differences were found between violet\nand blue light onsets, while violet light onsets were found to\nincrease left LGN activity significantly more than green light\nonsets (Table 2; Supplemental figure S2; Supplemental Tables S4).\nDISCUSSION\nThis study compared the brain responses elicited by violet, blue\nand green monochromatic light exposures of short duration (50 s)\nand equal irradiance (1013 ph\/cm2\/s) and presented in pairs of\ncolors in 3 separate sessions. We hypothesized that these short light\nexposures would induce wavelength-dependent modulations of\nbrain responses mainly in subcortical and brainstem areas.\nAccordingly, we report sustained wavelength-sensitive modula-\ntions of the regional brain responses evoked by a working memory\ntask. In particular, blue light is superior to violet light in eliciting\nthis response modulation. These results cannot be accounted for\nby any measurable difference in alertness or performance, nor by\nany order or expectation effect (Supplemental Data S1). These\nmodulations are considered \u2018\u2018sustained\u2019\u2019 because the brain activity\nis continuously enhanced during the 50 s blue light blocks and\nconsistently so during the whole blue\/violet fMRI session.\nAlthough sustained, these light-induced responses may be\nconsidered \u2018\u2018early responses\u2019\u2019 when compared to the brain\nresponses we reported after 18min of blue monochromatic light\nexposures [9]. As predicted, these early responses primarily involve\nsubcortical areas related to arousal (brainstem and thalami). At the\ncortical level, the responses are enhanced in a single area, the\nMFG. This result contrasts with the enhanced responses in\nwidespread cortical regions elicited by longer exposures [9] and\nsuggest that the functional recruitment of the cortex requires\nlonger exposures, and possibly the activating influence of\nsubcortical structures.\nAn unexpected finding concerned the transient responses\ntriggered at the onset of light exposures in two limbic areas, i.e.\nthe amygdala and the hippocampus, and the left thalamus,\nirrespective of whether the subjects were engaged in the working\nmemory task. These results are remarkable because blue light was\nsuperior to green light in eliciting these brain responses, even\nthough illuminance was about 5 times higher for the green light.\nCollectively, these sustained and transient responses show the\nefficacy of short wavelength (473nm) light in modulating brain\nactivity, and indirectly suggest the involvement of melanopsin-\nexpressing RGC, which are the photoreceptors most sensitive to\nthis wavelength.\nNonvisual versus visual responses\nThis study aimed at identifying brain and retinal mechanisms\ninvolved in early responses to light exposure that would likely be\nimplicated in establishing the nonvisual responses that have been\nreported using longer duration exposures [2\u201311,13,14]. The\nexperiment was not designed to ascertain whether or not these\nmechanisms constituted nonvisual responses to light. In fact we\nbelieve that the distinction between nonvisual and visual responses\ncannot be made in this experiment. Furthermore, there is growing\nevidence for a considerable overlap between visual and nonvisual\nphotoreception systems. In rodents, rods and cones are involved in\nnonvisual responses to light [13,27,29], and non-expressing-\nmelanopsin-expressing RGC project to nonvisual brain structures\n[24,28]. On the other hand, melanopsin-expressing RGC project\nto structures typically involved in vision in rodents and primates\n[23\u201325], and appear to regulate visual processing both in rodents\nand in humans [53,54]. Therefore, identifying a photoreceptor\nimplicated in a response, does not directly inform on the\nnonvisual\/visual nature of that response. In addition, in our\nprotocol, participants\u2019 visual system was stimulated during light\nexposures, as participants obviously perceived the light. We\nminimized differences in photoreceptor stimulation by equating\nirradiance level across wavelengths. However, because stimulation\nof retinal photoreceptors changed with the wavelength of the\nexposure, signals transmitted to the visual system varied between\nwavelengths. Finally, we report effects of light at onset and after\na few tens of seconds of exposure. From a human circadian biology\nperspective, this constitutes a very short time scale. During this\nperiod a mixed attenuation of cone signal and increase in intrinsic\nresponse of melanopsin-expressing RGC has been observed [25].\nThe sustained modulations of brain responses related to the task\nblocks arguably represent nonvisual responses. Indeed we report\nlight-induced modulations of brain responses that are related to an\nauditory task and are most sensitive to blue light, which suggest the\ninvolvement of melanopsin-expressing RGC. In addition, whereas\nvisual responses show quick attenuation [25], we detected\nmodulations of brain responses that were maintained for 50 s.\nOne could also argue that transient responses are nonvisual since\nthey are likely to be predominantly mediated by melanopsin-\nexpressing RGC. However, nonvisual responses are characterized\nby sustained activity modulation, and the transient effects we\ndetected could therefore be considered to be mediated by the\nvisual system. We believe that a more accurate description of our\ndata is that we detected transient and sustained brain responses to\nlight that appear to be predominantly mediated by melanopsin-\nexpressing RGC, without qualification with respect to the visual or\nnonvisual nature of these responses.\nSustained responses during task performance\nA sustained enhancement of responses to the working memory\ntask was observed during the exposures to blue, rather than violet\nlight, in the brainstem, the thalamus, and the left MFG. No\ndifference in response was observed when contrasting blue with\nBrain Responses to Light\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 November 2007 | Issue 11 | e1247\nFigure 2.

These results suggest that the\nsustained response modulation by monochromatic light is most\nsensitive to blue light and least sensitive to violet light. The status\nof green light can not be precisely estimated but is consistent with\nan intermediate sensitivity. By inference, these results suggest that\nmelanopsin-expressing RGC contribute most to these sustained\nresponses to light. The observed, albeit smaller responses to violet\nand green light could be explained in two ways. According to the\nfirst interpretation they represent a combination of a weak\ncontribution of S-cones and an intermediate involvement of M-\ncones. In line with this interpretation, melanopsin-expressing\nRGC and M-cones [13] seem to contribute greatly to nonvisual\nresponses to light during the first minutes of the exposure in\nrodents. According to the second interpretation, melanopsin-\nexpressing RGC are the only photoreceptors involved in the light\ninduced modulations of brain activity and the observed smaller\nresponses to violet and green light simply reflect the reduced\nsensitivity of melanopsin to these wavelengths. Melanopsin would\nTable 2.

This result is important because\nit is the first time a brainstem structure is shown to respond to light\nin human. The LC may be a key structure in establishing effects of\nlight. It could receive light information from the SCN, with which\nit is functionally connected in rodents [35]. As the major source of\nbrain norepinephrine, it is in a position to modify the level of\narousal [55,56]. Finally, it is well established that the LC is\ninvolved in cognition and in executive functioning in particular\n[55].\nThalamic nuclei appear as the structures most consistently\nrecruited in humans by \u2018\u2018nonvisual\u2019\u2019 responses to light (poly-\nchromatic white light exposure [8]; monochromatic 470nm blue\nlight exposure [9]). Like the brainstem, the thalamus is a key\nstructure involved in the interaction between alertness and\ncognition in humans [57] and it is recruited by working memory\ntasks [58]. In addition, the thalamus might receive irradiance\ninformation through a two step pathway linking melanopsin-\nexpressing RGC to the superior colliculus which in turn projects to\nthe pulvinar [59].\nCortical responses were enhanced after recurring 50s periods of\nblue (relative to violet) monochromatic light exposure only in the\nleft MFG, an area implicated in working memory [58]. This\nlimited recruitment of cortical areas contrasts with our previous\nexperiments, which used longer light exposures. Exposures to\nwhite light for about 21 minutes enhanced cortical responses to an\nauditory attention task in widespread cortical areas (dorso-lateral\nprefrontal cortex, IPS, superior parietal lobe, insula, precuneus,\nanterior and posterior cingulate cortices, and superior temporal\ngyrus [8]). Likewise, 18 min exposure to monochromatic blue\n(470 nm) light (as compared to green (550 nm) light) increased the\nresponses induced by a working memory task in the left IPS,\nsupramarginal gyrus, MFG, and right insula [9]. Collectively,\nthese findings suggest that nonvisual responses require some time\nto build-up in the cortex. The assessment of this time course will\nrequire further studies characterizing the relations between photon\ndensity, duration of light exposure, and regional brain responses.\nSuch studies will benefit from the methodological advances\npresented in this paper, namely within-session assessment of\nlight-induced brain responses, which provide a fast, reliable\ntechnique to characterize light-induced brain responses.\nBecause there are no direct connections between nonvisual\nsystem and the cortex, we surmise that the light-induced\nenhancement of cortical responses follows indirect pathways\ninvolving activating subcortical structures.\nTransient responses to light onsets\nAn unanticipated result was the responses in left hippocampus, left\nthalamus, and right amygdala at light onsets of blue, relative to\ngreen light. Such differential response was not observed in the\ncomparison between blue and violet lights or between violet and\ngreen lights. These results are surprising for several reasons.\nBecause the visual system is most sensitive to green (555 nm) light\n[15], and since light onset is a typical visual stimulus, we expected\ngreen light to induce the greatest responses at onsets. In addition,\nM- and L-cones signals were reported to elicit ON responses in\nmelanopsin-expressing RGC whereas S-cones were reported to\nmediate OFF responses [25]. Green light should therefore increase\nactivity in these melanopsin-expressing RGC at light onset, and\nbrain responses mediated by melanopsin-expressing RGC at light\nonset should be least sensitive to violet light.\nTaken together, these elements suggest that melanopsin-\nexpressing RGC contribute most to these transient limbic and\nthalamic responses to light onset. The reduced response sensitivity\nto violet and green lights could be explained in two ways. The\ncontribution of M-cones could be considered as the weakest and\nthe involvement of S-cones as intermediate, or melanopsin-\nexpressing RGC could be deemed as the only photoreceptors\ninvolved, with a greater sensitivity to wavelengths shorter than\n473nm as compared to longer than 473 nm wavelengths. Both\nassumptions could therefore suggest a shift in sensitivity between\nthe transient brain responses related to light onsets and the\nsustained responses associated to task blocks. Accordingly, shift in\nwavelength sensitivity with exposure duration and intensity has\nbeen reported for circadian phase shift and pupillary constriction\nin rodents [13,29]. However, in the brain areas showing responses\nmost sensitive to blue light, changes in wavelength sensitivity are\ninferred based on comparisons with blue light, not on significant\ndifferences between violet and green lights. Characterizing\nduration\/irradiance relationship will provide important data on\nchanges in the involvement of the different retinal photoreceptors\nin eliciting brain responses to light.\nDue to its anatomical connectivity, the amygdala is in good\nposition to quickly receive irradiance information. The medial\namygdala receives direct connections from melanopsin-expressing\nRGC in rodents [23]. In addition, a functional pathway linking the\nretina to the amygdala and bypassing the visual cortex through the\nsuperior colliculus and thalamus has been proposed in humans\n[59]. The hippocampus is connected to the amygdala [60], and\nboth structures receive numerous afferents from the LC [61],\na (potential) key component of nonvisual response system receiving\nindirect retinal projections [35].\nAt present, the functional significance of the limbic responses is\nunclear. However, it is tempting to suggest that blue light can\nmodulate emotional processing by the amygdala. These effects may\nbe related to the observed positive effects of long term light exposure\nregimes in seasonal affective disorder as well as in other psychiatric\ndisorders [26]. Direct assessment of the influence of light on\nemotional processing should be used o further address this question.\nOur protocol is very different from those used in vision\nneuroscience, because color vision investigations use isoluminant\nstimuli to account for luminance and brightness brain processing\n(e.g. Landisman and Ts\u2019o, 2002; Tootell et al., 2004). The\nsignificant difference in left LGN activity between violet and\ngreen light onset is therefore difficult to interpret. It is unlikely that\nit is related to the melanopsin-expressing RGC projections to the\nLGN found in Macaques [25], since it was not found in the session\ninvolving blue light.\nConclusion\nThis study is part of a series of investigations of light processing in\nthe entire human brain [7\u20139]. We demonstrate that a few tens of\nseconds of light induce immediate and significant wavelength-\ndependent changes in brain activity and that melanopsin-\nexpressing RGC seem to provide the most important contribution\nto these changes. Our results also suggest specific pathways which\nrelay light information from the retina to different brain areas and\nsuggest that light can indirectly enhance cortical responses by\nrecruiting structures in the brainstem and thalamus.\nSUPPORTING INFORMATION\nData S1\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0001247.s001 (0.03 MB\nDOC)\nBrain Responses to Light\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 8 November 2007 | Issue 11 | e1247\nMethod S1\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0001247.s002 (0.02 MB\nDOC)\nTable S1\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0001247.s003 (0.03 MB\nDOC)\nTable S2\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0001247.s004 (0.04 MB\nDOC)\nTable S3\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0001247.s005 (0.04 MB\nDOC)\nTable S4\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0001247.s006 (0.04 MB\nDOC)\nFigure S1 Behavioral results Mean values6SEM are plotted.\nThe color of the light corresponds to the bar color. a.
