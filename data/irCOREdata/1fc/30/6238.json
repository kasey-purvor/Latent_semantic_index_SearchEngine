Of the three, most educators readily\nunderstand the need for motivation (though how\nto help learners with this remains problematic)\nand many resources, approaches and techniques\nexist to help learners develop self-management.\nThe third requirement, capacity to reflect, is\nmuch less understood. So a book with the title\n'reflective learning in practice' seems welcome.\nThe book is organized in three parts: 'Purpose\nand themes', 'On the journey - learning through\nand around development programmes', and 'On\nthe journey - enabling effective learning'.\nReaders might not see immediately the shape of\nthe book from this, indicating a difficulty - there\nis not an altogether clear distinction between its\nparts. Part 1 is the most theoretical (and - be\nwarned - it is not an easy read); Parts 2 and 3 are\ncollections of case studies of learning within\norganizations. Part 2 differs from Part 3 in that\n'the learning processes' have 'some programmed\nelement at their centre' (p. 3). The authors\nrightly make the point that learning is not\nlimited to attending training courses;\norganizations need to be open to the full range\nof potential learning experiences.\nThe book is about reflective learning within\norganizations. These are diverse, for example the\nfollowing are featured: Sterling Bank, Sains-\nbury's, the NHS, Novartis, Pearl Assurance,\nThus pic, Kodak, Allied Distillers and Norwich\nUnion. Yet the authors take a discouraging view\nof the potential for such learning in a corporate\ncontext, in which 'legal rights of proprietors take\nprecedence over those of the employee' (p. 7).\nDominated by the 'rationalist tradition' in\nBritish management, the 'emotional content of\nlearning' is resisted, yet this is 'essential for\nenergising the learner, as well as being a critical\ncomponent of deeply reflective learning' (p. 20).\nThus a gloomy backdrop is set for the case\nstudies. These are a mixed bag - some much\nmore optimistic in tone than one might imagine\nfrom the first part of the book. In fact, some\ncase studies come uncomfortably close to self-\npublicity and corporate public relations.\nThe tone of some of these strikes an uncom-\nfortable contrast to the somewhat oppressively\nacademic discourse of the earlier chapters. As\ndoes the cosy in-talk of the consultant in\nChapter 9.\nBooks comprising chapters from different hands\n(and many of the chapters are themselves co-\nauthored) are invariably diverse in style and\ncontent. Even admitting the difficulty of\nachieving consistency across so many authors,\none nevertheless yearned for a stronger editorial\nhand. Direct contributions from the\norganizations themselves would also have been\ninteresting; the overwhelming voice is that of the\nmanagement consultant\/educator. What would\n125\nReviews\nSainsbury's have said, for example, about their\nrelationship with Manchester Metropolitan\nUniversity (Chapter 7)?\nThe intention of the book is 'to seek integration\nbetween useful theory and theoretically\ninsightful practice' (p. 3). This balance proves,\nfor the most part, elusive. There is a big gap\nbetween the theory of the framework set out in\nPart 1 and the detail of the case studies.\nThe authors define reflective learning as 'an\nintentional process, where social context and\nexperience are acknowledged, in which learners\nare active individuals, wholly present, engaging\nwith others, and open to challenge, and the\noutcome involves transformation as well as\nimprovement for both individuals and their\norganisation' (p. 6). This is an ambitious de-\nfinition. The book advances limits to what the\nlearner can achieve on their own: 'being able to\nundertake reflection alone is necessary but not\nsufficient' (p. 7). Other people have to be present\nto achieve 'transformation'. I have to question\nthis, not only through my experiences as a tutor\nand learner working independently in open and\ndistance learning but also when considering\nsaints and other outstanding individuals, who\nwithdraw from society either actually or in spirit,\nprecisely to achieve transformation - their own\nand that of others around them.\nAll in all, this book represents a challenge to the\nreader. It is unnecessarily complex, both in its\ntreatment of the topic and in the wearisome\nacademic style to which it often resorts. The case\nstudies, whilst infuriating at times, do contain\ninsights though even these can be overpowered\nby complex frameworks or uneven style.\nRoger Lewis\nHEFCE, UK\nRoger Lewis and Quentin Whitlock, How to Plan\nand Manage an E-learning Programme,\nAldershot: Gower. ISBN 0566 08424 4. \u00a349.50.\nLewis and Whitlock's How to Plan and Manage\nan E-learning Programme is targeted at\n'organisations wanting to make productive use\nof e-leaming'; and recognizes that 'the\nimplications of adopting new learning strategies\nor delivery methods are far-reaching and usually\nrequire major development input.' Written from\nthe perspective of planning for and managing\nthe 'far-reaching' implications of adopting e-\nlearning, the book provides a valuable guide to\n126\nthis whole range of issues. It should also be\nnoted that while the book is largely written from\na commercial training perspective, the lessons\nare equally valid for staff managing these\nprocesses in further or higher education.\nHowever, it is a little surprising how relatively\ninfrequently e-learning is actually mentioned,\nalthough, as the authors point out in the\nintroduction, this is exactly as it should be. There\nis little about e-learning from this perspective\nthat is actually new. Most of the issues that arise\nwith e-learning are the same as for other forms\nof open learning or for that matter from\nconventional classroom-based learning. What is\nperhaps new is that the potential of e-learning is\nleading many more organizations to engage with\nthese issues and for organizations new to these\nissues this a clear and succinct guide.\nThe book is divided into twelve chapters. The\nfirst two set out the authors' general approach\nwhich may be characterized as follows: begin\nwith the learners' needs and then follow sound\ncurriculum development procedures. This leads\nthem to divide the planning and management\nprocess into six stages: analysis of the learners,\nprogramme content, design, develop, pilot and\nrun.\nChapters 1 and 2 provide a general overview of\nthis iterative process and the following chapters\ntreat the issues arising from each of these stages\nin more detail.\nPerhaps surprisingly the analysis of the learners\nbegins in Chapter 3 with the consideration of the\nbusiness case and marketing strategy. To readers\nbased in the education sector this may seem an\nunusual place to begin, but understanding a\nlearner's needs begins with consideration of\nwhether the learner needs the learning that you\npropose to offer. This in turn leads to the\nquestion of whether you can develop, deliver\nand support this learning in a cost-effective\nmanner. Chapter 3 explores these issues and\nprovides useful guidance on how to cost and\nplan from this perspective.\nChapter 4 develops the analysis of learning\nneeds from a more obviously pedagogical\nperspective while Chapters 5, 6 and 7 look in\ndetail at how the response to these needs can be\narticulated into a set of measurable and\nassessable learning outcomes that can underpin\nthe planning and development of e-learning\nresources.\nAlt-] Volume 11 Number 3\nChapter 8 then addresses the issues involved in\nsupporting e-learners at all stages of their\nprogress from initial contact to completion. The\nchapter includes a brief but particularly useful\nconsideration of the role of the tutor in the\nsupport process.\nChapters 9 and 10 then address the issues in-\nvolved in selecting and\/or developing resources.\nChapter 9 provides useful guidance about how to\nevaluate existing materials for use or adaptation\nwithin your programmes, while Chapter 10\nexamines issues surrounding determining what\nsorts of materials may need to be developed.\nBoth chapters contain useful checklists of\nconsiderations and Chapter 10 also has a\nnumber of useful case studies. Indeed, overall\nthe book makes good use of both checklists and\ncase studies.\nChapter 11 considers the implications of\ndeveloping in-house or outsourcing. Among\nother things this includes a useful summary of\nthe skill sets and personnel that are likely to be\nrequired to maintain an in-house development\nstrategy. Readers of ALT-J may wish to call the\nresource implications of this perfectly reasonable\nanalysis to the attention of their managers.\nThe final chapter looks forward to the issues\ninvolved in embedding e-learning within wider\nvirtual or managed learning environments.\nArguably, this is the weakest chapter in the book,\nbut that is because this area is changing and\ndeveloping so rapidly.\nOverall the book has much to recommend it. It\nis clear and concise, but nonetheless covers the\nwhole range of issues that need to be considered\nwhen adopting e-learaing as an organizational\nstrategy. It will be most useful to those managers\nin both education and training organizations,\nwho, as yet, have little experience of e-learning.\nThis book can provide a quick and effective way\nof getting to grips with the scope of the issues\nthat are involved. Nonetheless, all but the most\nexperienced managers of e-learning will benefit\nfrom Lewis and Whitlock's expertise.\nIndeed, there is really only one drawback to this\nbook and that is the price. According to Amazon\nthe list price is \u00a349.50. At that price no self-\nrespecting reviewer could really recommend its\npurchase, even by libraries. One cannot help but\nfeel that the publishers are actively discouraging\nreaders from accessing the book; and that is a\nshame, because it is a good book.\nBruce Ingraham\nUniversity of Teesside, UK\nD. Murphy, R. Walker and G. Webb, Online\nLearning and Teaching with Technology: Case\nStudies, Experience and Practice, London: Kogan\nPage. ISBN: 0 7494 3520 8 2001. \u00a319.99.\nThe use of online learning is becoming pervasive\nin education whether through student- or\nteacher-led demand, or via management\ninsistence or peer pressure. This book does not\nattempt to provide instructions on how to put a\ncourse online, instead it chronicles the\nexperiences of early adopters of online\ntechnologies in order to help others to avoid - or\nat least understand - how to deal with the\nproblems and pitfalls these early adopters have\nfaced and grappled with.\nThe contributors from higher and further\neducation institutions in Australia, Canada,\nHong Kong, North America, the Pacific, and the\nUnited Kingdom relate their experiences in a\nnumber of situations. They identify the key\nissues, the problems they encountered, their\nattempts at resolution and reflect on their\nexperience. The emphasis is not so much on the\ntechnology (the editors take a broad view of\nwhat educational technology is anyway) but\nrather on a critical incident that happened to the\nauthors and how they learned and developed as\nan online teacher as a result of it.\nThe book is divided into four sections dealing\nwith issues of student interaction; teaching and\nassessment; planning and development; and\npolicy. Each case study comprises a summary of\nthe issues raised and some background to the\ncase, followed by the details of the case\npresented in two or more parts. Each part is\nseparated by a reflective break with questions\nposed for the reader to consider.\nThe studies focusing on interaction examine\ncases where environments designed to be highly\ninteractive have failed or where the interaction\nhas lead to tension,, argument or discord. In\n'Flame War', Robertson reports his experience\nof conflict when messages to a mailing list were\ninterpreted as a personal attack and the\ndiscussion degenerated into a 'flame war'. The\nreporter discusses the differences in managing\ndebate in a classroom situation and in an online\nenvironment, and provides an insight into the\nadditional factors that need to be considered in\nonline discussion.\nThose cases dealing with teaching and\nassessment consider the issues that arise in\nonline learning both by early adopters and by\n127\nReviews\nthose who felt compelled to move toward online\nlearning and found it more rewarding than they\nexpected it to be. In 'It seemed like a good idea\nat the time', Oliver discusses the unexpected\noutcomes arising from making what appeared to\nbe a small and positive change to a course. The\nchange was designed to benefit both students\nand teacher, and motivation was encouraged by\nthe allocation of marks to that activity. Oliver\nhighlights the need to monitor closely the online\ncourse and the difference in interaction,\nfeedback and communication between the face-\nto-face and online modes.\nThe challenges to those involved in planning and\ndevelopment are presented in cases which\ndescribe the problems posed to those involved in\nplanning and development issues in an atmo-\nsphere of rapid change in the type and avail-\nability of technologies; the consequent dangers\nof committing to particular hardware or soft-\nware and the need for staff development not just\nfor faculty but for all staff. Somekh in \"The great\nsoftware gamble' reports on the experience of a\nlarge project designed to develop discipline-\nspecific computer-based courseware spread\nacross a number of institutions. She describes\nthe impact of inadequate technology and rapidly\nchanging needs in higher education. Somekh\nconcludes that effective use of new technologies\nrequires a cross-discipline, integrated approach\nwith an institution-wide development plan; and\nthat courses need to be redesigned to incorporate\nvaried learning and teaching approaches.\nThe case studies relating to policy discuss the\nproblems and failures when staff have been\nobliged to develop online learning materials as a\nresult of policy decisions, the way these short-\ncomings, have been handled and the impact on\nthose teaching online. In 'Who is leading\nwhom?' Selinger tells a positive story of how\nteacher trainers at Warwick University addres-\nsed the disparity between the requirements of\nthe Department for Education and Employment\n(DoEE) for beginning teachers to know how,\nwhen and when not to use ICT, and the gap in\npractice, provision, infrastructure and skills both\nin schools and among students. By adopting a\nstudent-led approach with just-in-time support\nand continuing access to support and facilities\nthrough the use of First Class, a programme has\nbeen developed that meets the needs of students\nwith differing levels of skills and experience\nworking in schools with differing degrees of\ninfrastructure and integration of ICT. At the\nsame time they are meeting the statutory\n128\nrequirements of the DoEE. By making students\nthe agents of change they have been able to\nstrengthen the partnership between the Institute\nof Education at Warwick and the schools, and\nmove towards a role of support and develop-\nment.\nThe reader is encouraged to 'play the game' as\nthey read each case study by reading only Part\nOne before pausing to reflect, note their\nimpressions, predict what will happen next and\nconsider what course of action they would take.\nAt the end of the case study the reader is asked\nto reflect on how the situation was handled, the\ngeneral issues raised and what the case and the\nissues mean to the reader. Through being\nactively involved in the development of the case,\nthe decisions made and the outcomes one is able\nto draw on and benefit from the experiences of\nthese early adopters. This method of reading can\nbe adopted informally as an individual, in\ndiscussion with colleagues, or formally as an\nactivity for a group of students studying the\npractice of online learning and teaching.\nFurthermore, the way in which these case studies\nare presented promotes and provides a means to\npractice that essential element in teaching -\nreflection.\nThe contributors to this book are to be\ncongratulated in their willingness to share their\nexperiences, difficulties, solutions and the\nconsequences of the way they addressed the\nproblems so that the rest of us can benefit from\ntheir experience and at least try to avoid the\nsame pitfalls ourselves.\nElaine Pearson\nUniversity of Teesside, UK\nPhil Race (ed.), 2000 Tips for Trainers and Staff\nDevelopers, London: Kogan Page, 2001. ISBN\n0749436883, 287 pages, \u00a322.50.\n2000 Tips for Training and Staff Developers is\nbursting with informative bullet points of useful\ntips. They appear shouting at you on every page\nand it is not always easy to see which tip is really\nimportant and which is a 'by the way', although\nthe intention is not that you should read from\ncover to cover but dip into the book as and when\nthe need arises.\nThis is where the book excels in its-wide scope. It\nhas been largely compiled from 500 tips on\nteaching, lectures, group learning, using\ncomputers and open and flexible learning.\nAlt-J Volume 11 Number 3\nContents and index pages are clearly set out over\nthree pages each and can probably take you to\nwhatever aspect of teaching and training you are\ninterested in.\nRace is famous for his use of Post-Its in training\nsessions and sure enough they appear in their\nown short chapter with the use of flip charts. If\nyou have not done too many training sessions\nyou could do well to look at sections on working\nwith difficult participants and also the section on\ncoping with the unexpected.\nThe group-based training section has more sub-\nheaded bullets in light grey which are easy on the\neye and seem to clarify the important points\nwell. Getting a group of people to relax and\nwork with one another can sometimes be helped\nwith ice-breakers.\nRather than take the approach of giving as many\nroles as possible for those in the group working\nwith the facilitator, he polarizes the issue by\nusing the terms 'leader' and 'fellowship'. With a\nvery clear focus on the learning objectives of the\ntraining sessions and alignment with assessment,\nI ask, 'Is the power play of the management\nboardroom - of leader and follower a necessary\ncomponent?' Also instead of concentrating on\nsmall-group teaching methodologies such as\nthose found in the Jaques (2000) book which\nencourage positive interdependence - getting\nlearners to rely on each other to learn - there are\ntwo long chapters on how adverse behaviours of\nsmall groups can be rectified. The tips then come\ninto their own with useful suggestions.\nResults-based training is concerned with getting\ntrainees to learn by themselves and Race comes\nup with an impressive list of the types of trainees\nwho may be particularly helped including both\nhigh and low fliers, those using a second\nlanguage and even those people who do not like\nbeing taught! He provides a very useful and\nextensive checklist for flexible learning materials,\nwhich include details of content, the learning\noutcomes, structure and layout, and self-assess-\nment questions and activities. Choosing and\nusing computer-based resources is full of\nsensible common-sense ideas, which agonize\nover the frequently encountered problems of\nchoice - whether to use proprietary products,\nadapt, or create programmes from scratch.\nThe later chapters on helping trainees to work\ntogether with computers and make use of email\nand email groups is still based on sensible\ncommon-sense ideas. Advice is there on how to\ndeal with the technophobe and well as the\ntechnophile. The practicalities of setting up\ncomputers at an unknown location are outlined\nfollowed by a computer glossary.\nThe book ends with a separate chapter on\nevaluating your training. This is probably the\nmost useful chapter in the book. It provides\nsound questions to ask on what it is you hope to\nachieve using a questionnaire, how to structure\nquestions and advice on what to include and\nwhat to leave out!\nOverall, a brilliant book written in a lively and\ncommon-sense style which is bound to inspire a\ntrainer or staff developer to greater things. The\nbook is well laid out but clearly cannot do\neverything. You still need something that\noutlines small group activities more clearly and a\nlot more on the technical side of computers but\nthere are five pages on how you could retrieve\nthis information from the Internet and even what\nto do it if there is a power cut.\nJohn Sweet\nUWCM\nOtto Peter, Learning and Teaching in Distance\nEducation: Pedagogical Analyses and Inter-\npretations from an International Perspective.\nLondon: Kogan Page, 2001. ISBN: 0 7494 3594\n10. Paperback, viii + 279 pages, \u00a319.99.\nGovernment policies promoting widening access\nas well as an increasing focus on continued\nprofessional development and life-long learning\nhave prompted universities to re-evaluate their\neducational provision. Increasingly, providers\n(both traditional and commercial) turn to online\nlearning as a means of providing greater\nflexibility in course delivery. In light of the\nrecent growth of distance education pro-\ngrammes, Learning and Teaching in Distance\nEducation offers a timely and much-needed\nexploration of distance education's special peda-\ngogy, approaches and their implications for\nteaching and learning.\nThe book, an updated version of a previous\nhardcover edition titled Learning and Teaching in\nDistance Education: Analyses and Perspectives\nfrom an International Perspective, represents\nexcellent value. Case studies have been updated\nand conveniently consolidated in one chapter.\nThe revised edition also contains new material\non virtual universities and under 'Further\nreading' a substantial compilation of the latest\n129\nReviews\nliterature in distance education research (see\nreview by Pearson, ALT-J1, (3), 106-8). Like the\nfirst edition, the volume is structured into eight\nchapters, which are best approached sequen-\ntially, as later parts build on the theoretical\nconcepts introduced in the beginning.\nA review of the state-of-play in distance educa-\ntion sets the scene in the initial chapter. First-\ngeneration distance education methods, such as\ncorrespondence courses using print and supple-\nmentary media (television, tapes and video), exist\nin parallel to second- and third- generation\nmethodology. The latter two methods employ\nteleconferencing and Internet communication\ntechnologies, respectively, to overcome the geo-\ngraphical separation of teachers and learners and\nincrease dialogical learning. The advantages and\ndrawbacks of each of these approaches, however,\nonly highlight the dilemma of distance education,\nwhich has to balance a high degree of accessibility\nfor many with the quality of interaction in\nteaching and learning. Further, Peters introduces\na framework of five principal factors as the means\nto differentiate conceptually between distance\nlearning and conventional university education.\nThese factors, namely, technical media, structural\nhandicap, student type, forms of structural-\nization, and the special combination of forms of\nteaching and learning serve as criteria for the\norganization of the text and the analysis and\ninterpretation of distance education pedagogy.\nIn fact, the substantial contribution and strength\nof Peters's book lies in its rigorous academic\nexploration of distance education. There are\naspirations to develop a distance-learning\nscience and theory. To this effect, Chapter 2\nexamines different distance-teaching models\nemployed by different countries and schools of\nthought. Each of these models seeks to address\nthe structural handicap of distance education,\nthat is, the spatial and communicative or mental\ndistance between teachers and students.\nInterestingly, experts do not identify a clear\npreference for one model over others. Rather,\nweighting three aspects, (1) the level of dialogue,\n(2) the level of predetermination and structure\nof the study course and programme, and (3) the\nlevel of learner autonomy (self-determination of\nlearning goals), the optimal learning experience\ndepends on the student type and his\/her goals\nand expectations.\nThe concepts of dialogue, structure and auto-\nnomy are further explored, first theoretically and\nthen in their day-to-day application of distance\n130\neducation (Chapters 3 and 4). Here, Peters\nproduces an exhaustive and meticulous list of\nthe different dialogue-enhancing measures and\nstructural approaches applied in the field. The\nplurality in approaches used is great and if\nanything, the trend is to intensify the dialogue\nbetween teachers and students and amongst\nstudents, as communication is seen as an\nimportant element of learning and knowledge\nverification.\nChapters 5 and 6 offer especially stimulating\ndiscussion. Approaches in distance education\nare not only influenced by didactic and tech-\nnological considerations, but also by economic,\nsocial, cultural and political thought. This is\nreflected in the fact that distance and open\nlearning are increasingly used interchangeably.\nEducation and learning are not completed by the\naward of a degree but are supposed\" to continue\nthroughout life; they are supposed to be\naccessible and open to broad segments of\nsociety. Drawing on the relationships between\ncurrent societal trends, philosophical thought\nand distance education, Peters evaluates the\nimpact of digital information and commu-\nnication and speculates on future developments.\nHe outlines how digital communication and\nvirtual learning environments could help provide\nthe conditions to deliver the flexibility and\ncustomization that is stipulated by post-\nFordist\/post-industrial production if imbedded\nthoughtfully in suitable infrastructure.\nCommendably, Peters does not shy away from\ncontroversial issues. He suggests, or rather urges,\nthat educationalists must consider the implica-\ntions of the fundamental postmodern critique\non the values and aims of education. The rising\ndesire of students for self-development, fun and\nshort-term satisfaction are perhaps not\ndeliverable by time-tested models of distance\neducation with centrally planned curricula and\nstudents working mostly in isolation; this prob-\nably requires new models and further develop-\nment of the concept of the virtual university.\nIn Chapter 7, eight detailed institutional case\nstudies illustrate different distance education\nmodels and structures. The compilation of a\ncomprehensive and balanced set of examples,\nranging from correspondence studies in South\nAfrica to telecommunication-centred set-ups in\nNorth America demonstrates the authors'\nexpertise and broad knowledge of the subject.\nChapter 8 recaptures the main themes and\nprovides a final analysis.\nAlt-] Volume 11 Number 3\nOverall, the book is well written, except perhaps,\nfor the oversight to provide translations for a\nrange of German references, such as 'Einsamkeit\nund Freiheit' and the 'Wissenschaftsrat'.\nFrankly, this is an unfortunate omission, as the\nmeaning of these terms contributes significantly\nto the understanding of the passages and\narguments in which they are embedded.\nNonetheless, this second edition of Learning and\nTeaching in Distance Education is a worthwhile\nif not essential addition to the library of any\nacademic involved in distance education. Even\nfor those not interested in distance education,\nthe book is a valuable read. The pedagogic\nconcepts and discussions shed new light on\ntraditional university teaching and provide\nprovocative thought for the engagement of\nuniversities in online teaching and virtual\nteaching environments.\nAndrea I.
