Social rights continue to be a\nrelatively marginalised or qualified element of the human rights agenda and may be more\neffectively harnessed by way of a welfare rights approach based on a politics of needs\ninterpretation.\nThis article is concerned with the relationship between academic Social Policy and the\nhuman rights agenda. It will examine notions of rights from the perspective of Social\nPolicy as an academic subject1 before presenting a three pronged critique: it will critically\nexamine recent attempts to frame a \u2018human rights approach\u2019 to global poverty reduction;\nit will contend that welfare rights have been and continue within contemporary debates\nto be marginalised; it will argue for the incorporation of an alternative conception of\nwelfare rights as a component of the human rights agenda.\nWel fa re r igh ts and human r igh ts\nAs an inter- and multidisciplinary academic subject Social Policy has championed the\nclassic sociological formulation espoused by TH Marshall, who identified three kinds of\ncitizenship rights: civil or legal rights, political or democratic rights and social or welfare\nrights (Marshall, 1950). The capitalist welfare state gave expression to the latter. Marshall\u2019s\ncontention was that in liberal democracies the struggles of past centuries had delivered\nfirst the rule of law and then the universal franchise. However, the crowning achievement\nof the twentieth century \u2013 brought to fruition following the end of the Second World War \u2013\nhad been the consolidation of more or less systematic forms of social policy across the\ncapitalist world, providing certain rights to social security, healthcare, education, housing,\nsocial protection and, for example, legal aid for the poor. Democratic welfare capitalism,\nMarshall supposed, would secure equality of status for the individual citizens of nation\nstates.\nIt is citizenship rights that have in practice provided the foundations upon which\nmodern global conceptions of human rights have been constructed (e.g. Clarke, 1996).\nThe human rights instruments of the modern era \u2013 including and particularly the\n1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and its subsequent international\n1\nHartley Dean\ncovenants \u2013 generally assert the indivisibility of all human rights, yet they incorporate\nthe same distinction that Marshall drew between a \u2018first generation\u2019 of civil and political\nrights that had been defined though past struggles and a \u2018second generation\u2019 of rights\nidentified in the twentieth century. The UDHR characterises this second generation of\nrights as economic, social and cultural. Such rights relate to the means by which human\nbeings obtain their livelihood and the ways in which they are able to participate in human\nsociety. This is by implication the very stuff of Social Policy. More explicitly, the United\nNations 1993 Vienna Declaration has asserted that \u2018extreme poverty and social exclusion\nconstitute a violation of human dignity\u2019 (UN General Assembly, 1993: para. 25). Insofar as\nthe amelioration of poverty and social exclusion is a fundamental social policy objective,\nthe human rights agenda ostensibly embraces the concerns of Social Policy.\nIt is argued, nonetheless, that moral demands for economic, social and cultural justice\nare incapable of universal achievement and should not be regarded as human rights at all\n(Cranston, 1973); that the language of human rights is not necessarily appropriate to the\npursuit of social justice through public policy making (McLachlan, 2005). Social Policy\nhas engaged not so much with the idea of human rights as with Marshall\u2019s more specific\nconcept of social citizenship, and with an encompassing notion of welfare rights: a notion\nthat loosely captures the economic, social and economic components of human rights in\nterms of entitlements created through social legislation and the practices associated with\npromoting such entitlements (Dean, 2002). The welfare rights concept has therefore been\nessentially pragmatic. It takes into account that social rights of citizenship are shaped\nthrough the exercise of political rights or processes; and that civil or legal rights are\nrequired for the purposes of their enforcement.\nThe form and substance of welfare rights have always been contestable. Different\n\u2018welfare regimes\u2019 (Esping-Andersen, 1990) function with different notions of rights.\nWithin the liberal English-speaking tradition there has been a certain tendency to\nlook upon welfare rights in terms of safety nets for the relief of poverty or national\nminima for the prevention of poverty. In contrast, corporatist continental-European\nwelfare states have tended to see welfare rights as compensatory rights for their nations\u2019\nworkers, whereas Nordic social-democratic welfare states have been inclined to regard\nwelfare rather more in terms of universal rights for all citizens. Fundamentally, however,\nwelfare rights are rights that have in various ways been bestowed or demanded under\ncapitalism.\nIn contrast, second generation human rights have been conceptually more abstract\nand practically more elusive. The form in which they were encapsulated in the UDHR\nowed much to the Cold War tensions of that era (e.g. Hunt, 1996). They represented an\nuncomfortable compromise between, on the one hand, a liberal legacy summed up in\nFranklin Roosevelt\u2019s celebrated aphorism that \u2018a necessitous man is not a free man\u2019 (see\nEide, 2001) and, on the other, attempts by the Soviet communist bloc to inflect the agenda\naway from civil and political freedoms in favour of its own interpretation of human rights,\nbased on state organised economic and social guarantees (e.g. Wronka, 1992). Despite\nrhetorical assertions as to the indivisibility and interdependence of all human rights,\nthese tensions as to their substance \u2013 and as to the manner of their implementation and\nenforcement \u2013 led to the development of separate international covenants: one for civil\nand political rights, the other for economic, social and cultural rights. Later, with the\ncollapse of Soviet communism, human rights discourse became \u2013 for a time at least \u2013 less\nof a rhetorical propaganda medium (UNDP, 2000: 3).\n2\nSocial Policy and Human Rights: Re-thinking the Engagement\nIn the meantime, in response to the demands of the global south, the UN through the\n1986 Declaration of the Right to Development purported to institute a \u2018third generation\u2019 of\nhuman rights. The Declaration was intended, in the words of the Senegalese delegate, to\nexpress for the poorest people of the world \u2018the right to live better\u2019. It sought to establish\nthe principle that all human beings should be enabled to participate in a process of\nsocial, economic and political development (Rosas, 2001: 122). This new generation of\nrights incorporated demands for peace, a healthy environment and self-determination.\nIt implied not only individual rights, but collective, group and solidarity rights. In the\nprocess, however, it did not so much add to the canon of rights already set out in the\n1966 International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) as bring\nan element of ambiguity to the question of whether \u2018the right to live better\u2019 was a right\nto be demanded by citizens against individual nation states or a right of poor nations to\ninternational co-operation and assistance. Paradoxically, perhaps, this has served further\nto marginalise the idea that social or welfare rights may be regarded as a global species\nof human rights that could or should in themselves be inalienable and unconditional.\nAspirations based, for example, on group-rights to self-determination and\/or cultural\nfreedom (Kymlicka, 1995; Perez-Bustillo, 2001) seek to enlarge our understanding of civil\nand political rights, not economic and social rights.\nWithin Social Policy there have been concerns expressed as to whether a rights-based\napproach to welfare can be sustained in the face of economic globalisation (Mishra, 1999)\nand a realisation that the assumptions underpinning the idea of welfare rights do not\nreadily translate to the poorest nations of the world (Gough et al., 2004). Nonetheless, it\nhas been argued that it is now feasible at the international level to entertain the possibility\nof global approaches to social policy issues (Deacon, 1997). The specific object of this\narticle is to retrieve a conception of welfare rights and situate it more firmly in relation to\nthe theories and discourses of human rights.\nA human r igh ts approach to pover ty reduct ion?\nThe intuitively attractive idea of a human rights approach to poverty reduction took hold\nwith the publication of the Human Development Report 2000 (UNDP, 2000). Chapter 1\nof that report was contributed by the Nobel Prize winning economist, Amartya Sen,\nwho took the opportunity to explore the connection between human rights and human\ndevelopment. Sen\u2019s argument was that rights nourish our freedom, while development\nnourishes our capabilities (see also Sen, 1999). By capabilities, Sen was referring not to the\nthings that people may be able to do (their \u2018functionings\u2019), but to their capacity to choose\nand to live a life they value. Human rights may be expressed in terms of goals for human\nfunctioning, but human development depends axiomatically on freedom to achieve those\nchosen goals. For Sen, poverty is to be understood as capability deprivation. He draws\nupon Kant\u2019s distinction between perfect and imperfect duties to make the point that just\nbecause the rights demanded by or on behalf of the poor are neglected or repudiated\nby those with the power to honour them, this does not mean that such rights cannot\nbe inalienable. Sen\u2019s influence on the United Nations Development Programme and on\ninternational financial institutions such as the World Bank has been notable, and yet it\nmay be argued (Dean, 2002, 2004) that the international establishment has not properly\nembraced his central premise.\n3\nHartley Dean\nThe prevailing establishment discourse \u2013 which shines through in later chapters of\nthe Human Development Report 2000 \u2013 assumes that human development requires\neconomic growth; rights require liberal democracy; and both require a pluralistic and\nlargely de-politicised public realm in which non-governmental organisations and civil\nsociety groups can play a role as much as the state. It is claimed that economic,\nsocial and cultural rights are as important as civil and political rights (UNDP, 2000:\n9). And yet, it would seem, the rights that matter most are rights to free trade. Fostering\nhuman development, therefore, is a matter of creating incentive structures, furnishing\nappropriate regulation and facilitating participation. Poor countries, it is supposed, should\navail themselves of the opportunities that capitalist globalisation can provide. The later\nchapters of the Human Development Report 2000 slip into the discourse of new public\nmanagerialism (Clarke and Newman, 1997; Clarke, 2004; Braathen, 2005): rights to\nsocial development are to be achieved through technocratic processes, requiring such\nmanagerial techniques as self-assessment, benchmarking and culture change.\nIn the course of the Human Development Report 2000 the term \u2018human capital\u2019\nis insinuated as if it were a synonym for Sen\u2019s notion of \u2018human capabilities\u2019. Sen,\nhimself has remarked upon the limitations of the term human capital on the grounds\nthat \u2018human beings are not merely means of production, but also the end of the exercise\u2019\n(1999: 296). Concepts such as human capital and social capital (e.g. Putnam, 2000)\nhave become common currency within the dominant discourse. Though they may have\nan application within critical sociological analysis (e.g. Bordieu, 1997), as metaphors\nin policy discourse they take on distinctly reductive economistic meanings: individuals\nare constituted as actual or potential economic actors; societies are constituted as more\nor less functional or dysfunctional networks of actors. It is an approach that continues\nto reflect essential elements of the economic and political orthodoxy once dubbed the\n\u2018Washington Consensus\u2019 (Williamson, 1990). The recipe for tackling poverty still favours\nthe liberalisation of trade and financial markets, the privatisation and deregulation of\neconomic production, flexible labour markets, low public spending and taxation, and\nselective social \u2018safety nets\u2019 (generally, that is, means-tested and\/or conditional forms of\nsocial assistance for the poorest). The neo-liberal legacy of that consensus is an enduring\nhostility to \u2018big\u2019 government and scepticism towards welfare rights.\nThe Human Development Report 2003 (UNDP, 2003), announced the UN\u2019s\nMillennium Development Goals, by which it aims to eradicate poverty and promote\nhuman development in the course of the twenty-fist century. \u2018Daunting\u2019 though these\ngoals are held to be (ibid: 13), the specific aim of halving the incidence of extreme poverty\nand hunger by 2015 very clearly does not announce that freedom from extreme poverty\nor hunger is an inalienable human right. Implicit here is the principle of \u2018progressive\nrealisation\u2019, provided in Article 2 of the ICESCR, elaborated by the Limburg Principles\npromulgated on behalf the International Commission of Jurists in 1986 (see Hunt, 1996:\nAppendix 5) and consolidated in 1990 by a General Comment of the UN Committee\non Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (see Eide, 2001: 22). The later formulations\nowe something to the \u2018typology of duties\u2019 defined by Shue (1980), who had argued\nthat state parties to human rights instruments were obliged in the first instance only to\nrespect rights by not actively violating them (e.g. by not arbitrarily evicting slum dwellers);\nsecond, to protect such rights by preventing their infringement by third parties (e.g. by\nregulating the conduct of exploitative landlords); and third, to fulfil such rights to the\nextent that resources permit (e.g. through the provision of public or subsidised housing).\n4\nSocial Policy and Human Rights: Re-thinking the Engagement\nThe obligation imposed upon state parties by the ICESCR is that they should take steps\ntowards the full realisation of social, economic and cultural rights, but enforceable duties\ndo not necessarily arise directly or immediately. The result, critics complain, is a yawning\ngap between promise and reality (e.g. Pogge, 2002). The realisation of all human rights\nrequires time and resources. But the scale and urgency of the task of addressing world\npoverty starkly attest to the failure of the international community universally to implement\nan inalienable right to a standard of living adequate for health and well-being (as provided\nby Article 25 of the UDHR).\nNonetheless, in 2004 the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights issued\nDraft Guidelines for a Human Rights Approach to Poverty Reduction Strategies (OHCHR,\n2002). It is encouraging that such a document should be published at all, and yet the\nDraft Guidelines amount in tone and substance to a sister document to the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals and the recent Human Development Reports. The underlying premise\nappears to be that poverty is the antonym of development; poverty is construed as much\nas a consequence of economic failure as a violation of social rights. The Draft Guidelines\nexplicitly restate the principle of progressive realisation and seek to establish a set of\nindicators and benchmarks to ensure that economic development is matched in time by\nsocial development. The emphasis is on safety nets, good governance and performance\nmonitoring; upon the interdependence of rights and responsibilities, such that for example\nthe right to food should be linked to the right to work; upon the accountability of state\nparties as well as global actors. The document defines a process for the setting of targets in\nrelation to rights to food, health, education, work, housing, etc., but, significantly, mention\nof a right to social security (provided by Article 22 of the UDHR) is omitted. If poverty\nis a violation of rights, the potential of a human rights approach is that it can politicise\nthat gap between the promise offered by international human rights instruments and the\nreality of world poverty (e.g. Lister, 2004). However, the effect of the Draft Guidelines\nas presently written is to depoliticise poverty and to collude with a technocratic and\nessentially managerial approach to development. In practice, it would seem, the Draft\nGuidelines establish social standards, not welfare rights.\nThe marg ina l i sa t ion o f we l fa re r igh ts\nWithin the welfare states of the developed world, rights to welfare provision have tended\nto be conditional in nature and systemically subordinate to the specific legal and political\ncontext within which they are framed (Dean, 2002). And in the global context, welfare\nrights have always been marginal. This was reflected in the way the implementation and\nreporting mechanisms provided by the ICESCR were much weaker than those provided\nby the equivalent International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Economic and\nSocial Council created by the ICESCR eventually \u2013 in1985 \u2013 appointed the Committee\non Economic Social and Cultural Rights. The Committee receives quinquennial reports\nfrom state parties, but its jurisdiction is restricted to the making of \u2018general comments\u2019.\nSince 1992 the Committee has invited submissions from non-governmental organisations\nNGOs, but while international NGOs have been active in monitoring civil and political\nrights, they have shown less interest in rights to welfare provision (e.g. Hunt, 1996). What\nis more, new social movements of the global south and their academic allies \u2013 the post-\ndevelopment theorists \u2013 tend to be hostile to the role of the state as a guarantor of welfare,\nor else they seek to transcend what they dismiss as the mere \u2018politics of demand\u2019 in favour\n5\nHartley Dean\nof more authentic forms of political participation (Escobar, 1995; Waterman, 2001). That\nwelfare rights should remain at the margins of the human rights agenda at the beginning\nof the twenty-first century \u2013 despite burgeoning concerns about global poverty \u2013 would\nseem to be attributable to two countervailing, but mutually contradictory, hegemonic\npreoccupations: one with responsibility; the other with identity.\nTo observe that rights are related to responsibilities is trite, but true. The relationship\nbetween rights and responsibilities is deeply contested. To an extent, however, a\nprecipitating factor had been the \u2018crisis\u2019 that befell the capitalist welfare states from\nthe 1970s onwards (e.g. Mishra, 1984; Pierson, 1998). Associated with the shift in the\ncapitalist world from industrialism to post-industrialism and from Keynesian to monetarist\neconomic orthodoxy had been the ascendancy of a new ideological consensus. During\nwhat has been characterised as the \u2018golden age\u2019 of the welfare state (Esping-Andersen,\n1996) there had been a broad, if fragile, consensus between those who accepted collective\nresponsibility for human welfare (social democrats and social liberals) and those who\naccepted mutual obligation and social protectionism (social conservatives and republican\ntraditionalists). The alternative consensus, promoted initially by the so called New Right,\nwas one that combined, on the one hand, neo-conservative support from a strong state\nand obedience to traditional moral values with, on the other, neo-liberal support for free-\nmarkets and individual responsibility (Gamble, 1988; Roche, 1992). The rights of social\ncitizenship were brought into question by neo-conservatives because they undermined\nthe responsibilities of citizens to sustain themselves through paid employment and to\nsustain each other within families (Murray, 1984). They were brought into question by\nneo-liberals because they undermined the ethical freedoms and correlative civic duties\nof the individual property-owning subject (Nozik, 1974).\nThe inherent tensions within the New Right are more fluidly accommodated in the\n\u2018Third Way\u2019 compromise espoused first by Bill Clinton and then by Tony Blair (Jordan,\n1998), but whose influence may been seen not only across Europe (Bonoli and Powell,\n2002), but also in a wider global context (Deacon, 2003). Central, nonetheless, to the\nThird Way project is the mantra \u2018no rights without responsibilities\u2019 (Giddens, 1998: 65).\nThis entails both \u2018new paternalist\u2019 (Mead, 1997; Standing, 2002) and \u2018advanced liberal\u2019\n(Rose, 1999) elements. New paternalism is characterised by the creeping conditionality\nthat attaches to the administration of welfare rights not only in the developed world\n(Dwyer, 2004), but also in some parts of the developing world (e.g. Cimadamore et al.\n2005). Provision of social benefits for the poor is made conditional upon their willingness\nto seek employment, undertake training, attend health clinics, and\/or send their children\nto school. Advanced liberalism is a response to the imagined consequences of capitalist\nglobalisation, the crisis of trust in institutions and a transition to a \u2018risk society\u2019 (Beck, 1992;\nGiddens, 1994). The provision of human services must necessarily embrace a consumerist\nrather than a public service ethic (Le Grand, 2003). The primary role of welfare states\nand of social policy in a global context will no longer be to distribute resources or\nprovide directly for people\u2019s needs, but to enable people individually to manage risks.\nThe administration of welfare rights, it is supposed, must give way to self-provisioning,\nprudentialism and an individualistic ethic of self-responsibility.\nA very different challenge to welfare rights dates from what has loosely been called\nthe \u2018cultural turn\u2019 in progressive political thinking (e.g. Clarke, 1999), a turn that more\nor less coincided with the crisis of the welfare state. The concept of welfare rights and\nsocial citizenship that originally informed Social Policy was premised on the idea that\n6\nSocial Policy and Human Rights: Re-thinking the Engagement\nsuch rights represented the just outcome of a class-based politics that had been concerned\nto secure some measure of redistribution within systemically unequal capitalist societies.\nSuch assumptions have been called into question by intellectual movements that favour\nnew forms of politics, including a politics of discourse, a politics of identity and a politics\nof recognition. The cultural turn in the social sciences entailed the burgeoning of a\nvariety of critical theoretical traditions, drawing on theories of ideology and language,\nsymbolic interactionism, social constructionism and post-structuralism, all of which were\nfundamentally concerned with the practices by which social meanings are generated.\nWhile this unleashed extraordinary new insights into social relations of power, one effect\nwas to marginalise the analysis not just of class-based inequalities (Meiskins Wood,\n1995), but of social justice and welfare rights as well. Closely allied to this process was\nthe emergence of new social movements \u2013 including second wave feminism, the anti-\nracist and disability awareness movements \u2013 which drew attention to social divisions\nother than class and opened up questions about the way in which individual identities are\nconstructed through social differences (Taylor, 1998). By celebrating the sources of their\nidentity, people may demand a different kind of rights: rights not to redistribution, but\nto participation, empowerment and to recognition (Honneth, 1995; Fraser and Honneth,\n2003).\nSuch insights have had a major impact upon Social Policy, but our understanding of\nwelfare rights has tended to trail behind.\nRed iscover ing we l fa re r igh ts\nT.H. Marshall\u2019s liberal conception of social citizenship has been criticised because he\nwas inclined to envisage it, abstractly, in terms of an accommodation between competing\nprinciples (the principles of the free market versus those of the administrative state) rather\nthan, more concretely, as a political compromise between competing classes (Bottomore,\n1992). Welfare rights were seen as having been discovered and handed down from above\nas a solution to capitalism\u2019s tendency to disequilibrium rather than having been struggled\nfor and seized from below by organised labour or through the demands of the poor. Bryan\nTurner (1990) similarly draws a distinction between \u2018descending\u2019 and \u2018ascending\u2019 views\nof citizenship and he extends this to a discussion of human rights, arguing that such\nrights do not merely serve to bolster the autonomy of the human individual, but that \u2018it is\nfrom a collectively held recognition of individual frailty that rights as a system of mutual\nprotection gain their emotive force\u2019 (1993: 507; and see Turner, 2006).\nWhat is entailed in these different notions of both citizenship and human rights\nare two different perceptions or understandings of human dependency (Dean, 2004:\nchs. 1 and 10). The contractarian perception is averse to dependency and celebrates\nindependence: it seeks to enable people to engage with one another as freely contracting\nparties. The solidaristic perception acknowledges dependency and celebrates human\ninterdependence: it seeks to enable people to engage with one another in mutually\nprotective solidarity. Contractarian and solidaristic perceptions exist in tension with each\nother. And each in turn may be inflected towards quite different normative interpretations\n(ranging from the authoritarian to the egalitarian). By and large, however, it is a spectrum\nof essentially contractarian perceptions that has achieved ascendancy.2\nMid-twentieth century social liberalism had been willing to concede rights to welfare\nas a means to equality of status and opportunity. The \u2018advanced liberalism\u2019 of the new\n7\nHartley Dean\nmillennium is rather more insistent that rights should not precede the responsibilities of\nthe citizen. Whereas the language of welfare rights was once capable of accommodating\neither a contractarian or a solidaristic interpretation, the scope for such ambiguity may\nhave been narrowed. Recent research on popular discourse in the UK (see Dean, 2004)\nwould suggest that although a somewhat reluctant awareness of human interdependency\nand qualified support for welfare rights continue to survive, the ascendancy of an\nideological discourse premised upon an individualist ethic of responsibility is having\na corrosive affect on people\u2019s ability to interpret and support rights to welfare provision\nas a corollary to, or expression of, their own interdependency.\nWhile several of the new social movements that emerged during the second half of\nthe twentieth century were intent upon celebrating difference and identity, their emphasis\non individual identity was on occasions at the expense of solidaristic interpretations of\nrights. For example, elements of the women\u2019s movement have been criticised for middle-\nclass ethnocentricity (Davis, 1981) and\/or for pursuing essentially masculine notions of\nindependence (e.g. Pateman, 1989); the disabled people\u2019s movement for marginalising the\nneed that all human beings have for care (e.g. Shakespeare, 2000). It would be a mistake,\nhowever, to suppose that a concern with the issue of human identity must necessarily\nlead to an individualistic conception of rights. Taylor (1998) has drawn a distinction\nbetween two aspects of identity: \u2018categorical\u2019 and \u2018ontological\u2019. Our individual identities\nare constructed through a multiplicity of overlapping categorical identities relating to\ngender, age, sexuality, ethnicity, religion, abilities, etc. for which we may demand a right\nto recognition and respect. Our ontological identity, on the other hand, is what defines\nus as unique human beings in terms of the coherence and unity of the \u2018self\u2019. Sustaining\ncategorical identities may entail contractarian claims to equal treatment by the individual\nmembers of a variety of social groups. Sustaining ontological identity, however, entails\nsolidaristic claims to social protection by or on behalf of unique individuals. Human rights\ninstruments characteristically assert the inherent \u2018dignity\u2019 of all members of the human\nfamily. But, as ever, this may be interpreted in contractarian terms as a claim to the\nequal integrity and autonomy amidst a family of atomistic and self-seeking individuals,\nor in solidaristic terms as a claim to inclusion and security or \u2018asylum\u2019 (in the original\nmeaning of that word) amidst social diversity. It is this latter interpretation that is under\npressure. The welfare rights tradition could be called upon to interpret a right to social\nsecurity under capitalism as a right to asylum from the risks of an exploitative labour\nmarket and\/or the risks of poverty in old age; the right to housing as a right to asylum\nfrom the risks of homelessness; the right to social care as a right to asylum from the\nrisks of impairment and isolation associated with disability. Insofar as human dignity does\nrequire personal autonomy (cf. Doyal and Gough, 1991), this amounts to more than\nself-sufficiency (Williams, 1999). Dignity comes through social inclusion. Welfare rights\nentail the right be included with dignity in social relations of interdependency.\nThough it is not framed as such, one way of reinvigorating the welfare rights tradition\nwould be through what Nancy Fraser (1989) in her earlier work described as a \u2018politics of\nneeds interpretation\u2019. It is perhaps through a politics of needs interpretation that specific\nhuman needs may be translated into claims and asserted as rights, albeit in a manner that\nmight combine struggles over the redistribution of resources with identity-based struggles\nfor recognition (see Fraser and Honneth, 2003). It may be implied (see Fraser, 1997) that\na politics of needs interpretation would require several pre-conditions. It would require,\namongst other things, parity of participation and an end to systemic social inequalities;\n8\nSocial Policy and Human Rights: Re-thinking the Engagement\neffective dialogue between diverse social groups; that \u2018publicity\u2019 \u2013 in its literal sense \u2013\nbe accorded to the \u2018private\u2019 needs of women and oppressed minorities. This is a vision\nthat ushers in the possibility of welfare rights that are demanded and negotiated from the\nbottom up; that challenges not only the compromising conditionality of social rights in\nthe developed capitalist world, but also the inhibited and incremental nature of rights-\nbased approaches to poverty reduction for the global south; and that suggests ways of\nconnecting quotidian understandings of human rights with global social policy. It is not a\nsimple idea, but an attractive one, since it re-establishes welfare rights as unconditional\ndemands in the face of social injustice, both global and local. It is through the language\nof welfare rights and the processes by which they are negotiated that people may lay\nclaim to the satisfaction of their own needs, while also recognising the claims of distant\nstrangers. What is more, there are signs that the case for such a paradigm shift is more than\na scholarly preoccupation. For example, though rarely invoking the language of rights, a\ndraft Social Policy Guidance Note published by the UN\u2019s Department of Economic and\nSocial Affairs ventures at one point to assert that \u2018all the population groups of a country\nhave a right to a decent life (food, clothing, education, health services, employment\nstandards, social security, accessible housing, etc.)\u2019 (Ortiz, 2006: 12 [emphasis added]).\nConc lus ion\nThe broad concept of welfare rights that had been developed within Social Policy is under\nthreat as the basis of the capitalist welfare state has come into question. At the same time,\nit is not a concept that has entered to any significant extent into the prevailing human\nrights debate. That debate has struggled to give substance to ideas of economic, social\nand cultural rights, but has never ventured to forge a notion of welfare rights that might\nhave purchase and meaning as much in the global south as in the developed capitalist\nworld. Recent attempts to define a human rights approach to global poverty reduction\nwould seem to embody a managerial rather than an emancipatory ethos.\nFraser\u2019s notion of a \u2018politics of needs interpretation\u2019 offers one way of expanding and\nrelocating Social Policy\u2019s concept of welfare rights. It suggests a basis on which to engage\nwith the global human rights agenda. Conor Gearty (2006: 43) has recently argued that\nit is compassion \u2013 the \u2018active concern for others\u2019 \u2013 that can or should be signified by\nthe term \u2018human rights\u2019: it is the term we use \u2018when we are trying to describe decency\nin our post-philosophical world\u2019 (ibid: 57). This is not necessarily to concur that human\nrights provide us with \u2018values for a godless age\u2019 (Klug, 2000), because ultimately, I would\ncontend, human rights are social constructions, not eternal verities. As Ignatieff has put it\nrights are not the universal credo of a global society, not a secular religion, but something much\nmore limited and yet just as valuable: the shared vocabulary from which our arguments can\nbegin, and the bare human minimum from which different areas of flourishing can take root.\n(2001: 95)\nThe language of human rights undoubtedly represents a discursive resource upon which\nSocial Policy can strategically draw. The challenge is how concretely to re-establish claims\nto welfare rights within public debate?\n9\nHartley Dean\nAcknowledgements\nEarlier versions of this paper were presented under the title \u2018From poverty reduction to\nwelfare rights\u2019 at a conference, Crossing the Boundaries: The place of human rights in\ncontemporary scholarship, organised by the Centre for the Study of Human Rights at the\nLondon School of Economics and Political Science, UK on 24 March 2006; under the\ntitle \u2018Reconceptualising welfare rights\u2019 at a conference, Globalisation and the Political\nTheory of the Welfare State and Citizenship, organised by the Network of Political Theory\nin Denmark, at Aalborg University, Denmark on 4\u20135 May 2006; and under the title \u2018The\nsignificance of the human rights agenda for the future of social policy: imminent threat or\nstrategic opportunity\u2019 at a Social Policy Research Centre Seminar, University of New South\nWales, Sydney, Australia, 20 July 2006.
