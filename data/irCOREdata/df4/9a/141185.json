Introduction\nConcerns relating to homeland security have given rise to increased research into explosive\ndetection as well as further developments for existing analytical techniques to enable faster,\nmore sensitive, less expensive and simpler determinations to facilitate the trace identification\nof explosives.\nTraditional security measures at airports have included the use of metal detectors to identify\nweapons that may be concealed in conjunction with X-ray machines for viewing the contents\nof baggage. One major problem is that explosive substances are often not easily detectable\nusing conventional approaches and in this context many terrorist groups have adapted to\navoid the use of metallic objects. Approaches to detect volatile substances, such as ion\nmobility spectrometry in conjunction with swabbing, while in routine use - are largely only\nsuitable for the screening of items of hand baggage.\nFor the detection of traces of explosive substances in the air, issues related to the low\nvapour pressures of many explosives are only exacerbated further when these explosives\nare wrapped or packaged to avoid detection. The increasing use of peroxide based\nexplosives has led to much research into detection of this group of explosive substances, the\nissue being that many current chemical identification techniques are based on the nitrogen\nand carbon content of a substance for identification and this practice is not suitable for\nperoxide explosives.\nThis review primarily focuses on the detection of concealed explosives and their precursors \/\ndegradation products. Areas that are covered include trace, bulk and vapour detection\ntechniques and those described for the stand-off detection of explosive substances. Peer\nreviewed papers from the last 5 years are presented as well as referring to other review\npapers of particular interest.\n2. Spectroscopic approaches for the detection of explosives\nThe principle of mass spectroscopic methods is that samples are drawn from the air into a\nmass spectrometer where they are ionised, the resultant ions separated by electrical and\nmagnetic fields according to mass charge ratio and detected and quantified. These methods\ndisplay very high sensitivities and selectivities but are often expensive and require laboratory\nbased equipment. Much current work is addressed to reducing size and cost of such\nequipment.\n2.1. Ion mobility spectroscopy\n2.1.1. Principle\nIon mobility spectrometry (IMS) is one of the most widely used detection techniques in\nroutine use due to its ability to characterise the sample both qualitatively and quantitatively -\nas well as the very low detection limits that are often attainable. The reader is referred to a\n2001 critical review of ion mobility spectrometry for the detection of explosives and explosive\nrelated compounds [1].\nIMS characterises a sample through the mobility of ions within the gas-phase of the\ninstrument whilst an electric field is applied (see figure 1). The sample vapours are ionised at\natmospheric pressure before introduction into the drift tube. The drift times are related to the\nmass of the ions and by determining the mass\/charge ratio, it is possible to identify\ncomponents within the sample through comparison with known standards.\nMost commercially available apparatus use 63Ni or 241Am [2] as the ionisation source. The\nradioactive nature of these ionisation sources, however, can cause concerns relating to\nsafety and environmental impact. As such, there has been investigation into alternative\nsources for ionisation with a focus towards negative corona discharge approaches [2, 3].\nCorona discharge as an ionisation source does have some associated complications,\nnamely the variation of reactant ions produced, as compared to those gained with a 63Ni\nsource \u2013 as well as susceptibility to degradation of reactant ions and failure at the discharge\npoint. Waltman et al., 2008, described a distributed plasma atmospheric pressure ionisation\nsource that involved the application of a high-voltage alternating current across a dielectric to\nproduce plasma within which the sample was ionised [4]. This technique was reported to be\nunaffected by tip erosion (of which corona discharge approaches can be prone) \u2013 and\nmoreover requires less power than corona discharge sources.\nInvestigation into enabling the miniaturisation and portability of IMS apparatus for field\ndeployment has increased over recent years. Tabrizchi and Ilbeigi, 2010, investigated a\npositive corona discharge technique using a curtain plate preventing the diffusion of NOx into\nthe ionisation region so allowing analysis in air as opposed to nitrogen [5]. A shortening of\nthe length of the drift tube and minimising the ionisation source would usually be associated\nwith a corresponding decline in sensitivity, however, the use of a capacitive-trans impedance\namplifier has been shown to offer resolution comparable with, and sensitivity exceeding,\ncommercial bench top instruments [6]. An ion focussing aspiration condenser has been\ndescribed where two parallel gas flows travel through a transverse electric field; the upper\nflow contains the ion stream which is then geometrically focussed until the ions are forced\ninto the lower gas stream and onto the base electrode. The different ion species are\nseparated by their mobility into separate beams and then detected. This apparatus typically\nuses less power, is less costly to manufacture, as well as being smaller than many\ncommercial instruments \u2013 and for these reasons may be incorporated into a hand-held\nsystem [7].\nMartin et al., 2007, described a micro-fabricated hotplate coated with a sorbent polymer as a\ntechnique to trap analytes of interest prior to analysis with IMS; this technique reportedly\nenhanced sensitivity by at least one order of magnitude [8]. A technique to decrease false\npositive results without any significant increase in analysis time has been described, using a\nshort column packed with adsorbent packing material; this method enables pre-separation\nafter ionisation of the sample furthermore offering the capacity to retain interference for\nlonger, thus minimising their influence on the resulting spectra [9].\n2.2. Mass spectroscopy\n2.2.1. Principle\nMass spectrometry (MS) in various forms has been used successfully to detect explosives\ndue to its specificity in identifying substances and the speed at which analyses are\ncompleted. Due to the size and expense of previous MS devices, this technique has not\nbeen widely used within some security oriented settings. Mass spectrometry separates and\nanalyses the chemical composition of a substance according to its\u2019 mass-to-charge (m\/e)\nratio. Two methods by which this may be achieved include time separation and geometric\nseparation based approaches. There are many forms of mass spectrometry including, for\nexample: quadrupole, ion trap, time-of-flight (TOF) and tandem based techniques (MS\/MS)\n[10].\nThe use of a mass spectrometer for security or forensic analyses would often involve the\nsubstance of interest either being within a complex sample matrix or absorbed upon a\nsurface. Work has been undertaken towards improving the techniques for the introduction of\nsamples into the mass spectrometer. The aim is not only the improvement of selectivity\ntowards the material of interest, but also to remove the necessity for pre-concentration of\nsamples before analysis. In addition to these factors, miniaturisation and lowering of unit\ncost have also been key research areas.\n2.2.2. Recent advances\nAmbient ionisation techniques have been investigated to address some of the issues\nmentioned above. Atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation (APCI) involves the ionisation\nof a sample and carrier gas within the gas phase using corona discharge. Song and Cooks,\n2006, further developed this technique by using the carrier gases acetonitrile and air to\nenable selective detection of nitroaromatic explosives through the formation of adducts that\nsubsequently fragment in a predictable manner [11]. APCI has also been investigated using\na reversed gas flow introduction into the source which improves the ionisation of\nnitro-compounds before introduction into the tandem mass spectrometer [12]. Samples were\ncollected both using a swab and directly from the skin of a hand that had handled explosive\nmaterial. Using this approach 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) was detected at a concentration of\n3 pg L-1. A single proton laser ionisation technique has been described as a rapid\nlaser-based technique and enables explosive detection with little fragmentation, thus\nallowing easier identification of the parent ion [13]. Limits of detection for nitrobenzene and\n2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) were reported to be 90-130 ng L-1 and 320 ng L-1 respectively. This\ntechnique was, however, only suitable for molecules with an ionisation energy above 10.49\neV.\nDesorption electrospray ionisation (DESI) enables analysis of the substance of interest in its\nambient environment by bombarding it with a mist of electrically charged droplets so creating\nions which are drawn into the mass spectrometer with a vacuum [14]. This technique has\nbeen employed in the swift and specific detection of explosives on skin [15] and within\ncomplex matrices such as diesel fuel and lubricants [16]. Direct analysis in real time (DART)\nis a technique similar to DESI in that a sample may be analysed in its ambient location\nwithout preparation; however, in DART an electrical potential is applied to a carrier gas and\nthe resulting excited-state species desorb molecules from the sample which are introduced\ninto the mass spectrometer [14, 17]. This technique has been comprehensively tested on\nvarious surfaces including clothing, currency and concrete \u2013 as well as a wide variety of\nchemicals of interest [18, 19]. A desorption corona beam ionisation source (DCBI) is also\nable to work under ambient conditions without preparation of the sample. This technique is\nsimilar to DART, however in this case a visible thin corona beam is generated which may be\nused to analyse a specific area of the sample surface or even to visualise the surface of the\nsample on a molecular level [20]. The reader is referred to several recent reviews that\nconsider the advancements in ambient mass spectrometry in greater depth [21, 22].\nThe size of mass spectrometers have previously presented a drawback to their use,\nhowever, much work has been undertaken into the miniaturisation of components and\naddressing safety considerations to enable the development of field deployable instruments.\nA simulation was undertaken in 2004 to establish the worth of a miniaturised system\ninvolving an array of micrometer sized cylindrical ion traps that decreased the voltage\nnecessary for operation and the resulting size of the device in its entirety [23]. The use of\nDESI with a portable mass spectrometer has demonstrated rapid detection of explosive\ncompounds in situ from a variety of surfaces and, for example, with RDX (1,3,5-\nTrinitro-1,3,5-triazacyclohexane) on paper, a LOD of less than 1 ng was observed [24].\nSanders et al, 2010, demonstrated the detection of explosives on surfaces with a\nminiaturised system capable of detecting negatively charges ions. Samples of explosives\nwere randomly applied to a large surface in 1\u00b5g cm-2 quantities and a DESI mass spectrum\ncorresponding to each of the explosive signals was observed [25]. Further investigation into\nthe use of atmospheric pressure ionisation techniques with a cylindrical ion trap\nfield-deployable mass spectrometer setup has demonstrated LODs of 1 ng and 250 pg for\nRDX and PETN (pentaerythritol tetranitrate) respectively [26]. A system integrating three\nmethods has recently been described, employing thermal desorption, single photon\nionisation and ion trap mass approaches. This system was tested using pure samples and\nthose within a matrix. While significant fragmentation with those complex samples was\nfound, the system was found to be free from false readings [27].\nCoupled techniques such as gas chromatography- mass spectrometry (GCMS) have also\nbeen utilised. These systems combine the separation ability of gas chromatography with the\nsensitivity and specificity of a mass spectrometer. Since September 11th attacks, explosive\ndetection devices have become incorporated into all US airports and many of these utilise\nGCMS A typical example is Thermo Scientific\u2019s EGIS Defender, licensed by the FAA for use\nat US airports (www.thermoscientific.com). This system couples high speed gas\nchromatography with ion-mobility mass spectrometry to give a system capable of detection\nof a range of explosives (C4, Semtex, peroxides, TNT and nitrates) at nanogram levels in\nseconds. Other systems include the IONSCAN 500DT from Smiths Detection Technologies\n(www.smithsdetection.com) or General Electrics \u201cpuffer\u201d system.\n2.3. Terahertz spectroscopy\n2.3.1. Principle\nThe field of terahertz (THz) spectroscopy has been investigated many times over previous\nyears as a technique for the detection of explosive vapour signatures [28-30]. There have\nbeen, however, drawbacks associated with this technology that have prevented\ndevelopment into a feasible system, and these include: the frame rate speed, a loss of\nattenuation as distance from sample increases, and, power requirements for the system [31].\nRecently some of these issues have been addressed and the technology is further being\nconsidered as not only an explosive detection method, but also a way to detect weapons\nand other concealed objects within luggage and beneath clothing. Terahertz radiation lies in\nthe far infra-red region \u2013 from 0.1 to 10 THz. In this range waves can penetrate through\nmany non-polar dielectric materials, such as wood or leather, and the low photon energies\nare at a level one million times less than that of X-ray photons. Most explosives and\nexplosive related compounds have spectral fingerprints within this range and, as many\napparatus operate within the range 0.1-2.0 THz, this highlights THz radiation as a\nprospective sensor and imaging agent for the detection of concealed explosive substances.\n2.3.2. Recent advances\nLiu et al., 2006, described the detection and identification of both exposed and covered\nsamples of RDX using diffusely reflected THz waves [32]. When the THz waves strike a\nsmooth sample surface, the reflected beam has the same angle as the incident angle, this\nphenomena being known as specular Fresnal reflection. In reality, the sample surface is not\nusually smooth or aligned precisely within the THz beam and consequently the angle\nnecessary for detection can be difficult to determine. As such, studying the diffuse Fresnel\nreflection (the reflection angle gained when a THz wave hits an uneven section of the\nsurface) is more applicable to field-based analyses. Using this technique, Liu et al\ndemonstrated the detection of RDX, exposed and covered by various materials, with a\nconsistent fingerprint present at 0.82 THz.\nChen et al., 2007, investigated the absorption spectra of seventeen explosives and explosive\nrelated compounds (ERC) using THz spectroscopy [33]. Most of the substances examined\nexhibited characteristic absorption features in the 0.1-2.8 THz range. These results may be\nused to form a fingerprint database of explosives and ERCs. Through improvements in\nemitters and sensors, new spectral features have also been established for explosives within\nthe frequency region of 3 \u2013 6 THz [29, 30, 34].\nWork has been undertaken into the influence of so called \u2018confusion\u2019 materials such as, for\nexample, food or toiletries, on the resulting spectra of any explosive compound also present\n[35]. It was established that while most of the confusion materials do not exhibit sharp\nspectral features in the terahertz region, substances containing sugar did have a spectral\nsignature \u2013 although this does differ from the explosive substances within the test and so did\nnot cause interference.\n2.4. Infra-red spectroscopy\n2.4.1. Principle\nThe principle of infra-red spectroscopic methods is that samples passed through an infra-red\nbeam, certain groups adsorb at specific wavelengths allowing detection of many materials.\nSensitivity and specificity can be issues and current work is attempting to address these\nchallenges.\nFourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy is a technique largely used in to replace the\nmore traditional dispersive instruments; this enables a considerable decrease in the time\ntaken for sample analysis since it is capable of scanning all IR frequencies simultaneously\nrather than individually. An FTIR spectrum obtained was shown to allow identification of\nsubstances through its absorption at different wavelengths of light.\n2.4.2. Recent advances\nPrimera-Pedrozo et al, 2009, reported a technique for the detection and quantification of\nhigh explosive residues on metallic surfaces using fibre optic coupled reflection\/absorption\ninfrared spectroscopy (RAIRS). When an infrared beam is directed at a smooth surface it\npasses through the sample and is reflected back through this coating again; this is known as\nspecular reflectance and is the basis for the RAIRS technique. Coupling this technique with\na Fourier transform probe, containing fibre optic cables that transmit in the mid-infrared\nrange, enables analysis of samples in-situ rather than within the spectrometer sample\nchamber. Micro-RAIRS may also be used for topographical analysis of the substrate surface\nbefore sample examination. Low detection limits were reported of 160 ng cm-2 for TNT and\nTetryl; 220 ng cm-2 for PETN and DNT; and 400 ng cm-2 for HMX (Octahydro-1,3,5,7-\ntetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine) adsorbed on the metal surface [36].\nThe detection and identification of explosive particles in fingerprints has been described by\nMou and Rabalais, 2009, using attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared\n(ATR-FTIR) spectromicroscopy. Particles are first located within the ridges of the fingerprint\nusing the ATR probe and then analysed with infrared radiation. The ATR-FTIR technique is\nclassed as non destructive as the ridge patterns of the fingerprints remain the same and are\ntherefore suitable for subsequent identification. The explosives particles present are able to\nbe identified using a spectral library; however, in this work the library was not specific and\ndid not contain the spectra of TNT and DNT - the analogue dinitrobenzene (DNB) was\nidentified as closely matching those explosive compounds [37].\n2.5. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy\n2.5.1. Priinciple\nLaser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) uses a high intensity laser to vaporise the\nsample under investigation creating a plasma plume and the light subsequently emitted from\nthis plasma enables characterisation of the sample. LIBS, as a detection technique, holds\nmany advantages, especially in the field of explosives detection, some of which include: no\nneed for sample preparation, the ability for real time results, apparatus that may be\nruggedized and miniaturised for field work, a sensitive technique requiring only a small\nsample and the capacity for stand-off detection approach. For a more in-depth look at LIBS\nfor explosive detection the reader is referred to Gottfried et al, 2009 [38].\n2.5.2. Challenges and advances\nDespite the obvious advantages of LIBS as a detection method, there are drawbacks\nassociated with this technique. To enable use as a stand-off detection method, detection will\nusually need to be performed in the open air. The main constituents of many explosives are\ncarbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen and it is the ratios of oxygen and nitrogen relative to\ncarbon and hydrogen that form a distinguishing characteristic of many high explosive\ncompounds. Inferences from oxygen and nitrogen in the atmosphere affect these ratios and,\ntherefore, the characterisation of explosive compounds. This was illustrated by Lucena et al,\n2010, in a comparison detection study of explosives in air and in helium [39]. De Lucia et al,\n2007, proposed the use of a double pulse LIBS technique to diminish the effects of\natmospheric interference. The double pulse increased the amount of excited atoms in the\nsample due to an increased plasma plume and it is believed that this also decreased the\natmospheric gas density around the sample. This technique removed most of the\natmospheric interference and aided discrimination between the explosive RDX and an\norganic material, diesel fuel [40].\nTo enable the detection of explosive materials at stand-off distances and in difficult to access\nareas Bohling et al, 2007, reported a LIBS system coupled to a probe like device which\nconsisted of optical fibres, a focussing lens and a mechanical shutter system to protect the\noptics from any debris during use. The active fibre acts as an amplifier for the microchip\nlaser and the passive optical fibre directs the laser pulses to the tip of the sensor. This\nsystem offers the possibility for combination with an automated device. Principle component\nanalysis (PCA) and neural networking approaches were also reported in this paper to allow\nthe identification of hidden objects with an accuracy above 80% and false identifications\nbelow 5% [41].\nDikmelik et al, 2008, proposed the use of femtosecond laser pulses to decrease the amount\nof fragmentation during the LIBS process. Nanosecond laser pulses are generally utilised\nalthough this tends to fragment a sample into its elemental constituents. When ultrafast\nexcitation is employed, the fragmentation is less severe and emission is observed from CN\nand C2 molecules which may be used as a marker for, in this case, TNT [42].\n2.6. Raman spectroscopy\n2.6.1. Principle\nRaman spectroscopy measures the vibrational transitions in a sample through the collection\nand analysis of scattered photons once the sample has undergone laser excitation.\nResulting spectra can offer a fingerprint of the item under analysis that can identify individual\ncomponents of the sample. Due to the near instantaneous results and possible stand-off\ncapacity, allowing samples to be analysed at some distance from the instrumentation [43],\nthe potential of this technique for use as an explosives detection method has led to\nconsiderable work within this area. A review that described advances in the capacity of\nportable Raman instrumentation has also highlighted some of the issues relating to\nproducing instrumentation for field deployable apparatus [44]. Sensitivity is an issue, much of\nthis has been addressed by using techniques such as surface enhanced Raman\nspectroscopy which displays much higher sensitivity. Since much of the equipment used is\nstill laboratory based, future trends indicate that much more portable instruments are\nrequired and are being developed. Use of fibre optic technology to allow remote sampling is\nalso being investigated.\n2.6.2. Recent advances\nPacheco-Londo\u00f1o et al, 2009, reported the use of a continuous wave laser technique to\nincrease the resulting signal to noise ratio and thus improve stand-off distances for explosive\ndetection. Detection at distances of up to 7m was described for the explosives TNT, DNT,\nRDX, TATP (triacetone triperoxide) and C4. The general-purpose plastic explosive Semtex\ncontaining RDX and PETN could not, however, be distinguished from the background\ninterference due to the fluorescent nature of the explosive mixture. Limits of detection were\nachieved at 2 mg for DNT and TNT; 3 mg for RDX and C4 and 10 mg for TATP at a distance\nof 7 m [45]. This study was not, however, conducted in a manner that transfers readily into a\nfield-operable device since determinations were undertaken indoors and in the dark to\nminimise interferences.\nA study into stand-off explosive detection in realistic field environments was undertaken by\nthe Swedish Defence Research Agency. Measurements of various improvised explosive\ndevices (IEDs) at stand-off distances of 20, 30 and 55 m were performed in varying weather\nconditions \u2013 from snow to sun and temperatures ranging from +22 \u00baC to -8 \u00baC. The\ninstrumentation, including a 532 nm pulsed laser source, was kept inside a laboratory\nthroughout the study and the beam directed outside onto an explosives approved test field.\nadjacent to the laboratory, thereby allowing the samples to be placed outdoors in an open\nenvironment. Bulk quantities of samples were satisfactorily identified through both regular\nglass bottles (green and brown) and PET (polyethylene terephthalate) containers and\nweather variations were found to have a minimal effect on measurements [46]. Issues that\nmay arise include possible interfering fluorescence in the visible spectral region due to the\ncontainer as well as how this system may cope with detection of trace amounts of the\nexplosive substance.\nThe issue of interfering fluorescence may be addressed using a narrow gate width to\nexclude the majority of the interfering agents whilst still collecting the Raman signal relating\nto the sample. Fleger et al, 2009, propose such a technique \u2013 the interaction time for Raman\nscattering is less than 1 ps, however, luminescence scattering takes much longer between\nexcitation and decay. As such, when a sample is interrogated with a short laser pulse, all\nRaman photons are generated almost instantaneously but the luminescence photons are\ngenerated over a longer time period. When the detection system has a narrow gate, all\nRaman photons will be collected with the minimum amount of luminescence. This allows a\ngreater signal to noise ratio and enables detection of explosive substances with strong\nluminescent properties, such as Semtex [47].\nThe detection of explosive particles with backward coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering\n(B-CARS) was studied by Portnov et al, 2010. Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering\n(CARS) involves three laser beams which interact with the sample and generate a new\ncoherent optical signal at the anti-Stokes frequency. A spectrum with the same information\nas a spontaneous Raman spectrum is obtained though, with much higher sensitivity.\nB-CARS utilises the signal obtained from the diffuse reflections gained when a sample is\ninterrogated using CARS. Using this technique the spectral fingerprint remains\nfundamentally the same as when processed with Raman, but the intensity is much greater\nwith a more favourable signal to noise ratio. Stand-off distances were extrapolated to be as\ngreat as 180, 21 and 13 m for potassium nitrate, PETN and RDX respectively [48].\nConfocal Raman microscopy enables the detection and identification of explosive\nsubstances and this approach can also provide information on physical properties such as\nthe crystal structure, molecular orientation and possible interactions. Raman microscopy\nuses a focused laser beam within a microscope and operates in a confocal mode through\nthe use of an aperture within the microscope - this enables depth recognition alongside the\nspectral profile usually gained with Raman spectroscopy.\nConfocal Raman microscopy has been utilised for the detection and identification of\nexplosive substances on the surface of human nail and from beneath a coating of nail\nvarnish. It was discovered that although the nail itself produced spectral bands these did not\ninhibit identification of the explosives under examination, in this case PETN, TNT, AN\n(ammonium nitrate) and hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA), since interference could be\nexcluded with careful focussing of the confocal beam. Coating the explosive and nail with\nnail varnish presented no additional problems for detection, with a two-dimensional Raman\nmap gained for PETN and with no significant interference in the Raman spectra [49]. The\nsame technique has been investigated for the detection of single particles of the explosives:\nPETN, AN and TNT [50]; as well as HMTA and pentaerythritol [51], on clothing. These\nstudies looked at both natural and synthetic fibres, dyed and undyed, to imitate the in-situ\ndetection of a person who may have handled explosive substances. Confocal Raman\nmicroscopy produced identifiable Raman fingerprints for each of the explosive compounds\nwhere each explosive particle was within the maximum dimensions of 5-10 \u00b5m. Interference\nfrom the fibres, although present, did not fall within the Raman spectral profile of explosives\ntested. The main issue with this technique would appear to be visual identification of the\nexplosive particles prior to testing.\n2.7. Cavity ring down spectroscopy\n2.7.1. Principle\nIn cavity ringdown spectroscopy (CRDS) a short pulse of light is injected into a resonant\ncavity which is surrounded by highly reflective mirrors. When sufficient radiation has built up\nwithin the cavity, the laser is turned off and the exponential decay of the intensity of the light\nis measured over time. The decay time for an empty cavity is then compared with one\ncontaining a substance of interest and a spectrum is obtained. The molecular absorbance,\nand therefore the concentration, may also be derived from the rate of decay. For a more\nin-depth overview of CRDS as a technique see Paldus and Kachanov, 2005, and Berden et\nal, 2000 [52, 53].\n2.7.2. Recent advances\nRamos and Dagdigian, 2007, described a study into the use of ultra-violet CRDS as a\nmeans to improve on the low sensitivities related to infra-red CDRS. It was the case that\nUV-CRDS was able to detect the explosive related compounds 2,4-DNT and 2,6-DNT at\nconcentrations 100 times less than their room temperature vapour pressures. The issue,\nhowever, was that this technique was unable to decisively identify specific samples due to its\npoor selectivity in the 240-260 nm spectral range [54]. This seems to be in opposition to\nIR-CRDS which has distinct spectral features but much lower sensitivity. There was also an\nissue with atmospheric interferences, especially ozone. It was suggested, however, that\ncoupling this device with a less sensitive but more selective technique could overcome these\nproblems. An increase in laser pulse energies may also lower the noise related to the photon\ndecay; however, applying this technique to improve sensitivity also has the capacity to distort\nthe decay profile through pre-dissociation of the compound leading to issues of identification\n[55].\nSnels et al, 2010, reported a feasibility study involving the use of flash heater in a CRD cell\nto evaporate solid explosive samples prior to detection in the near infrared (see figure 2).\nThis technique aimed to address issues previously described in the literature such as poor\nselectivity in the UV region and the inability to record a full CRD spectrum in short time\nperiods when recorded in the mid-infrared range. The discrimination between three similar\ncompounds, 2,4-DNT, 2,6-DNT and TNT, was possible with the use of PCA and detection\nlimits were reported at around 75 ng. Suggestions to improve this technique include the use\nof higher reflectivity mirrors and alternative heating geometry [56]. This technique was\nperformed in ambient atmosphere with little interference, however, measurements at room\ntemperatures were not possible and neither were investigations into explosive vapours in air.\n3. Olfactory type sensors\nTwo types of olfactory sensor can be thought to exist, natural and artificial. Dogs have long\nbeen used to detect explosives and other species are being investigated, however the\nissues facing these methods are time and cost of training animals and lack of quantitative\ninformation. Electronic noses are being developed but as yet do not have the specificity and\nreliability for field use. Improving the performance of these artificial noses is necessary\nbefore they will be suitable for field work.\n3.1. Animals\nDogs have long been known to have a highly developed sense of smell and this has been\nexploited for the detection of explosives since World War II [57]. The use of sniffer dogs for\nthe detection of volatile explosive vapours is still widespread due to their fast, directional and\nreal-time capabilities. Some studies have been undertaken into the reliability of canines for\ndetection of explosives as there can be inconsistency between different dogs and the same\ndogs at different times [58]. Other animals have also been studied to establish any suitability\nfor vapour detection. Rats have a sensitive and discriminating olfactory system and have\nbeen shown to correctly discriminate between odours and alert when explosives are present\nusing a remote monitoring technique [59]. Insects, such as Drosophila melanogaster, have\nalso been investigated due to the capability they have to detect a large range of odours and\nthe simple olfactory system they possess. Incorporation of insect olfactory receptor neurons\ninto a biosensor array has been reported by Marshall et al, 2010, with some success\ntowards detecting illicit substances [60]. A comprehensive discussion into neural processing\nand olfactory research has been produced by Glatz and Bailey-Hill, 2010 [61].\nThere has been work attempting to establish the method by which an animal is able to detect\nan explosive target, whether it is through establishing an olfactory search image [62] or if the\nolfactory ability is predetermined by the polymorphisms in olfactory receptor genes - in this\ncase, of the canine [63]. Detection of TNT and RDX has been demonstrated with olfactory\nsensory neurons obtained from rats and pigs [64], suggesting that explosive compounds do\nindeed interact with and activate olfactory receptors.\n3.2. Electronic noses\nA comprehensive review describing fluid dynamic sampling and its potential relationship to\nartificial olfactory devices has been published [44] which includes a broad discussion of\ncontemporary artificial sampling techniques as well as suggestions for future research areas.\nArtificial olfactory type sensors \u201celectronic noses\u201d have also been applied towards the\ndetection of explosives [65]. Electronic noses usually consist of an array of chemical sensors\nwhich interact with a vapour in different ways and to different extents, combined with a\npattern recognition system such as an artificial neural network. The basic principle is that\neach sensor will give a different response depending on the nature and concentration of\nvapour present and the pattern recognition process will allow determination of the analyte. A\ndetailed description of electronic noses and their application to explosive detection is beyond\nthe scope of this chapter but has been reviewed elsewhere [45].\nThe chemical sensing elements can be electronic, piezoelectric or optical in nature and be\norganic or inorganic. Typical examples could include arrays of fluorescent polymers which\ncan be quenched by interaction with a vapour. Only those polymers that interact are\nquenched. Fluorimetric arrays can also be used which consists of layers of multiple silica or\npolymer beads incorporating fluorescent dyes which are quenched by explosive vapours\n[66]. These can be photographed by a CCD camera and used determine a variety of organic\nvapours including nitroaromatic comounds. Polymer\/carbon black composite films which\nchange their conductivity upon exposure to vapours can also be used, although each film is\nnot specific in itself, the overall changes in the array can be used to determine the presence\nof analytes [67]. Other workers have utilised gold nanoparticle arrays and measured the\nchange in their conductivity upon exposure to vapours [68]. Piezoelectric type devices have\nbeen used such as surface acoustic wave devices or microcantilever sensors [65].\n4. Sensor techniques\nOne technique that can potentially address many of the issues required for reproducible\ndetection of explosives is that of sensors which could be low cost, portable and specific. The\nprinciple of sensors is that they contain an immobilised active species, such as an enzyme,\nwhich can selectively recognise the explosive required. A transduction step which can be\noptical, electrochemicalo or some other technique is then required to convert the recognition\nevent into a measurable change, such as the production of electrons which can be\nmeasured at an electrode. However sensitivity is an issue, many sensors cannot simply\ndetect the low levels of explosive vapours required. The future trends for this field are\nattempts to improve sensitivity, reliability and reproducibility\n4.1. Chemical sensors\nThe principle of chemical sensors is a simple one, to have a chemical which undergoes a\nselective chemical reaction with an explosive vapour, leading to an observable product such\nas a change in colour or conductivity. TNT is a system containing an aromatic ring\nsubstituted with electron withdrawing nitro groups. This means it will form charge transfer\ncomplexes with systems that can donate electrons. For example reacting TNT with bases\nleads to strong visible colour changes [69]. These types of systems have been commercially\nexploited, for instance in the EXPRAY and DROPEX systems, where suspected surfaces\n(clothing, packages etc) are wiped with a special test paper and then the paper sprayed with\nproprietary aerosols. Colour changes are indicative of the presence of trace amounts of\nexplosive. There are several aerosols and from the colour developed in response to each\naerosol it is possible to determine the presence and identity of explosive. Targets include\nTNT, DNT, plastic explosive and nitrates.\nA suitable base for reaction with TNT is the organic amino group and this has been used to\nmodify silicon nanowires to give electrochemical sensors which can detect TNT in water\ndown to sub-femto molar concentrations [70]. Other workers modified silica nanoparticles\nwith amine groups and fluorescent dyes, the amine groups bound TNT which then quenched\nthe fluorescence of the dyes, allowing detection of the explosive at levels of 1 nmol l-1 TNT in\nsolution and several ppb of TNT vapour in air [71].\nOther chemical sensors include ones based on conductive polymers. Recent examples\ninclude an electrochemical sensor based on polyaniline deposited on an electrode as a\nnanofibrous composite with a polypeptide. Amino groups within the polypeptide form\ncomplexes with electron-deficient species such as TNT, this immobilises the TNT in close\nproximity to the conducting polymer, allowing its determination in solution by adsorptive\nstripping voltammetry [72]. Other workers used a composite of polyaniline and carbon\nnanotubes for the detection of nitroaromatic vapours including TNT. The amine group of\npolyaniline forms a charge transfer complex with TNT, leading to an increase in the electrical\nresistance of the polymer [73]. Another conducting polymer used within a vapour sensor is\npoly(3,4-dioxyethylene thiophene) (PEDOT) which could be deposited to form a conductive\nnanowire between two gold electrodes. Coating this electrical junction with an ionic liquid\nallowed the system to adsorb TNT vapour from the air and then the electrochemical\nreductions of TNT as well as the conductance change of the polymer nanojunction caused\nfrom the reduction product could be simultaneously measured. This sensor is capable of\ndetecting within a few minutes parts-per-trillion level TNT in the presence of various\ninterferents [74].\n4.2. Electrochemical sensors\n4.2.1. Principle\nElectrochemical sensors can be categorised into potentiometric (measurement of potential\ndifference\/voltage); amperometric (measurement of current) and conductimetric\n(measurement of conductivity) based devices according to the transduction approach\nadopted [75]. These types of sensor are fast, inexpensive with high sensitivity and a viable\noption for miniaturisation [76]. Electrochemical detection techniques can respond to redox\nsubstances; the electrical output results from a flow in electrons or ions caused by the\nchemical reaction that takes place at the surface of the electrode. Due to this, the redox\nproperties of nitroaromatic explosive substances ideally lend themselves to electrochemical\ndetection. The detection of peroxide based explosives is more complex due to the fact they\ndo not fluoresce, have minimal UV absorption and a lack of nitro groups \u2013 all necessary\nparameters upon which traditional detection techniques are based [77]. Electrochemical\nsensors in this context offer an opportunity to detect peroxide based explosives that would\notherwise prove problematic.\n4.2.2. Recent advances\nSquare-wave voltammetry (SWV) is an often described technique for field-based operations\ndue to the speed of scan rates, the sensitivity and the compact, low power instrumentation\navailable [78]. Ag\u00fc\u00ed et al, 2005, described a technique that coupled carbon-fibre\nmicroelectrodes with SWV to increase the surface area of the working electrode also\nprovides fissures within its surface into which nitroaromatic compounds adsorb. Resulting\ndetection limits obtained in phosphate buffer (PBS) were reported to be as low as 30 \u00b5g L-1\n[79]. Cizek et al, 2010, reported a preliminary study into the integration of a preconcentration\ndevice to thermally desorb the TNT from the gaseous phase before electrochemical\nreduction with a screen-printed hydrogel-coated electrode using SWV. This preconcentration\nstep allowed detection of TNT vapours from a solid sample upstream of the apparatus [80].\nA technique involving a layer by layer assembly of alternate layers of mesoporous SiO2\n(MSU) and polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDDA) upon the surface of a glassy\ncarbon electrode was found to increase pore volume, diameter and, therefore, surface area\nof the working electrode; this increased sensitivity to nitroaromatic compounds especially\nwhen at lower detection limits. This approach suffers, however, from an intrinsic issue with\nsilica of poor conductivity which can have an effect on the performance of the sensor\nplatform. The limit of detection for TNT was found to be 340 ng L-1 in aqueous solution [81].\nFu et al, 2010, reported the synthesis of a SiO2 microsphere comprised of a mesoporous\nsilica shell modified with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTS) to attach amino functional\ngroups. This system was applied to glassy carbon electrodes as a sensing layer for\nnitroaromatics, especially TNT. Using square wave voltammetry, a detection limit of 114 ng\nL-1 in 0.5 mol L-1 NaCl was achieved and 81% of original response was obtained after 30\ndays [82]. Ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) has, more recently, been investigated to\nimprove sensitivity towards nitro-explosives and the performance of the electrochemical\nsensor. The OMC provided a much improved surface area, as with the silica based system,\nand an enhanced conductivity which produced a sensor with lower limits of detection [83].\nThe detection of peroxide-based explosives has become increasingly important due to the\nease at which some may be synthesised from commercially available substances and hence\ntheir link to terrorist activities. Lu et al, 2006, described a technique for rapidly monitoring\nliquid peroxide-based explosives using an electrode modified with Prussian-blue as an\nartificial peroxidase and amperometric detection of the resulting hydrogen peroxide\ngenerated [84]. Detection limits were reported as 7.4 \u03bcg L-1 for TATP in PBS after a 15 s\nirradiation time. Parajuli and Miao, 2009, reported an electrogenerated chemiluminescence\n(ECL) technique that was enhanced (by up to 20 times) by the inclusion of silver nitrate at\nthe platinum electrode. This system involved the oxidation of HMTD by the electrogenerated\nspecies allowing a detection limit of 1 mg L-1 in acetonitrile to be achieved [85].\nWang and Pumera, 2006, produced a microchip flow-injection analysis for trace amounts of\nTNT. The authors described the need for \u2018lab-on-a-chip\u2019 technology to achieve a fast, simple\nand cheap alternative to laboratory-based techniques [86]. This approach used\nelectro-osmotic flow to move samples through the microchip manifolds and measures\nresponse to TNT amperometrically. Amalgam mercury\/gold disc electrodes were used due\nto their favourable signal-to-noise ratio and detection limits of 7 \u00b5g L-1 in sodium borate\nbuffer were described, with the added advantages of a high-throughput system and minimal\nsample consumption.\nA textile based electrochemical sensing system was described as a means to provide a\nwearable chemical sensor. Here, various textiles were analysed to assess performance as a\nscreen-printed electrode with a breathable and waterproof fabric Gore-Tex (TM) being found\nto exhibit promising properties for use in this field. Properties such as, for example:\nhydrophobicity and printing quality on the fabric were found to afford the subsequent\nelectrochemical activity of the sensors. Detection of nitroaromatic compounds was\ndemonstrated and an initial assessment into the resilience of the fabric as a sensor platform\nwas conducted successfully [87].\nThe development of single use processes to enable disposable electrochemical sensing has\nbecome more desirable to facilitate a portable explosive sensor. Chen et al, 2006, described\nthe use of a Nafion (TM) coated, pre-anodised screen-printed carbon electrode that\nincreased the sharpness of peaks and, therefore, the ease of identification of substituent\ngroups upon the nitroaromatic compound. Recovery of TNT from spiked lake water was\n95.7%, with this complex matrix only affecting the sample slightly [88].\nBhalla et al, 2011, described a biosensor that detects picric acid effectively based on the\ninhibition of the Photosystem II (PSII) in the presence of explosives. Photosystem II is a\nprotein complex involved in the electron chain reaction in photosynthesis. Gold screen-\nprinted electrodes were functionalised with the PSII and the sensing system was based on\nthe inhibition of the natural photosynthetic reaction by the presence of explosive compounds.\nPicric acid was found to compete with QB plastoquinone for its binding site on the protein\ncomplex of PSII. This disrupts the electron transfer process and decreases the resulting\nphotocurrent, which was observed through steady-state electrochemical interrogation. The\ndetection limit in MES buffer for picric acid in this system was found to be 5.7 \u03bcg L-1 [89].\nYu et al, 2009, reported the combination of electrochemical and piezoelectric transduction\nmechanisms as a detection technique, using the ionic liquid BMIBF4\n(1-methyl-3-butylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate) as both the electrolyte and the sorption\nsolvent to enable this multi-faceted system. The accuracy of a system such as this was\nincreased due to the validation that one system may have over the other [90].\n4.3. Immunochemical\nImmunochemical sensors exploit characteristics of the antibody-antigen reaction in such a\nmanner that produces a device that can be highly specific to its target molecule. This feature\nand the fact that it is possible to produce antibodies for a specific purpose make this an\nexpanding field of research into explosives detection.\nA recent review by Smith et al, 2008, provides a more comprehensive report on not only\nimmunochemical sensors, but also biosensors and biologically-inspired systems for\nexplosive detection in general [91].\nAnderson et al, 2006, reported a multiplexed immunoassay approach using a flow\ncytometer, the Luminex100, which contains 100 different sets of fluorescent latex\nmicrospheres, each of which is encoded by two fluorescent dyes. The ratio of the emission\nrecorded at two different wavelengths enables identification of each set. The limit of\ndetection for TNT in PBS was found to be 1.0 \u00b5g L-1 [92]. Detection of peroxide based\nexplosives using immunoassays have been less reported. Anderson et al, 2010, described\nthe comparison of two monoclonal and one polyclonal commercial antibodies as well as the\ndevelopment of llama polyclonal antibodies for use in the detection of PETN. As before,\nevaluation was performed with the Luminex100 flow cytometer. Binding was found to occur\nbetween bioconjugates of PETN and the antibodies but binding with the free PETN was\nlimited [93]. This can often be the case when the target molecule is small and so further\ndevelopment within this area is necessary before detection of PETN in this manner becomes\na possibility.\nSurface Plasmon resonance (SPR) immunosensors act by detecting a change in the\nrefractive index at the surface of the sensor due to an alteration in the binding of molecules\nimmobilised on this surface. Where a large molecule binds with the immobilised antibody, a\nlarge signal is gained. Explosive molecules tend to only give rise to a small signal due to\ntheir relatively small size and this causes an issue with sensitivity, this is especially apparent\nin miniaturised systems. As such, amplification techniques have been investigated to\nimprove detection of small analytes and competitive inhibition is often employed. Nagatomo\net al, 2009, reported a novel oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG)-based self-assembled monolayer\nupon a bare gold chip using an anti-DNT antibody for an indirect competitive binding effect.\nIn the presence of DNT, there was an inhibition of surface binding, decreasing the SPR\nangle. This system exhibited high sensitivity for DNT, with a limit of detection of 20 ng L-1 in\nPBS [94]. A nano-scale biosensor chip surface modified with a polyamidoamine dendrimer\nwas reported to enhance the antibody surface loading capacity while increasing the\nselectivity towards TNT molecules in a stable, easily regenerated system [95]. A schematic\nof these types of system is shown in figure 3 where an antigen of interest has been\ncovalently immobilised on the SPR chip surface. If a solution of antibody mixed with a\nsample containing no antigen flows over the sensor surface, it binds to the immobilised\nantigen causing a large shift in resonance angle. However should the sample contain the\nantigen, there will be competition for the antibody between free and bound antigen, less\nantibody will therefore bind to the surface and a lower shift in resonance angle will be seen.\n4.4. Luminescence sensors\n4.4.1. Principle\nLuminescence based sensors for detecting explosive compounds may be described as\nutilising either direct or indirect detection methods. Direct detection techniques utilises any\nfluorescence which the sample may emit itself or through inducement with a chemical\nreaction. Indirect detection involves the implication of explosives being present through their\neffect on a fluorescent material such as, for example, via quenching. While recent\ndevelopments within this area are examined here, the reader is referred to a more\ncomprehensive review of luminescence-based explosive detection methods [96].\n4.4.2. Recent advances\nToal et al, 2006, reported a technique to visually detect the quenching of photoluminescence\nin the presence of nitroaromatic explosives using a metallole-containing polymer adsorbed\non filter paper onto which a sample of the explosive compound was spray coated from\nacetone or fingerprinted from a solid sample. Under illumination with UV light, quenching\nwas observed and detection limits were as low as 5 ng for TNT. One issue with a technique\nsuch as this is that observation of a colour change can be a subjective activity and so\ncombining this with another, more qualitative system or an automated approach may be\nnecessary [97]. This group\u2019s work was continued to make the sensor more selective by\nincorporating a tandem process that first quenches the metallole in the presence of\nnitroaromatics as described above. A thin film of 2,3-diaminonaphthalene (DAN) is then\napplied which cancels the polymetallole luminescence and, in the presence of nitroamine\nand\/or nitrate-ester explosives, a reaction with the DAN forms a blue luminescent complex\n[98]. An investigation into synthesising polymers and copolymers and their relevance to\nexplosive detection was also undertaken by this group which reported some polymers were\nable to detect nitroaromatic, nitro-amine and nitro-ester explosive compounds [99]. Further\nwork was reported that coupled the tandem process mentioned previously with an efficient\nblue-emitting silafluorene-fluorene copolymer system that was able to detect trace\nparticulates of samples of all of the nitro-based explosives, allowing detection limits as low\nas 1 pg cm-1 [100].\nA fluorescent film produced as a self-assembled monolayer has been described by Du et al,\n2010. This group introduced a benzene ring as the spacer component to ensure favourable\npacking of the pyrene moieties as they self assembled. The effect of the addition of the\naromatic structure was an increased quenching of the fluorescence emitted when in the\npresence of nitroaromatic compounds, most especially with picric acid where the detection\nlimit was established at 2.3 \u00b5g L-1 in water. This is believed to be due to the extension\noutside the film of the pyrene moieties and the restriction of motion caused by the inclusion\nof benzene [101].\nShi et al, 2008, described the quenching effect that nitroaromatic compounds have on oleic\nacid covered CdSe quantum dots. This work reported detection limits around 10-6 to 10-7 mol\nL-1 for a range of compounds, for example 340 \u03bcg L-1 for TNT in chloroform, making this a\nviable screening technique. Further technique optimisation is necessary before it may be\nseen as a workable alternative to fluorescent polymers [102]. The combination of quantum\ndots with a dendrimer, such as PAMAM (poly(amido amine)) generation 4 [103], has been\nreported to increase biocompatibility and biostability as well as increasing reactivity. Such\nimprovements increased water solubility and as a consequence signal output.\nPhoto-fragmentation of nitro-based explosives at 193 nm has been demonstrated by\nMonterola et al, 2008. At this wavelength the NO2 moieties are released from the compound\nand may be detected through their chemiluminescent interaction with a solution of luminol.\nTrace amounts of PETN vapour were detected at 3 ppb (40 ng L-1) and analysis of PETN in\na soil matrix yielded a LOD range of 0.5-4.3 \u03bcg g-1. This technique is fast and simple but\ndoes not identify the specific molecule, giving only a general identification of a nitro-based\nsample being present [104].\nPonnu and Anslyn, 2010, produced a cyclodextrin (CD) sensor by combining the CD with a\nfluorophore, bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene (BPEA), to produce a cyclodextrin inclusion\ncomplex. The cavities of this complex are less polar than water and so are able to extract\nhydrophobic molecules from aqueous environments. When applied to aqueous solutions\ncontaining explosives, quenching occurred in the presence of nitroaromatic compounds \u2013\nbut not other nitro-based explosives. Quenching effects were found to be greater with the\ncomplex as opposed to the fluorophore alone [105].\nCaron et al, 2010, reported a portable fluorescent detector capable of ultra-trace detection of\nthe nitroaromatic compounds TNT and DNT, which was unaffected by environmental\nhumidity or interfering substances [106, 107]. This detector utilised a specific fluorescent\nconjugated polymer which adsorbed nitroaromatic vapours present in airborne samples with\na concurrent decrease in fluorescence. Although at present this device only detects\nnitroaromatics, a multi-faceted design may be possible using several fluorescent material\nplatforms. A sensor array of commercially available fluorescent polymers was evaluated by\nWoodka et al, 2010, to attempt to limit the possibility of false positives due to a high\nconcentration of non-explosive electron withdrawing compounds (EWC). The responses\ngained from a variety of explosives, explosive related compounds and non-explosive EWCs\nin water were analysed using principal component and linear discriminant analyses. The\narray was found to discriminate between the explosive, non-explosive and explosive related\nelectron withdrawing compounds and in this way was demonstrated as a platform approach\nfor minimising the likelihood of false positives [108].\n5. Nanotechnology\nNanotechnology has become a rapidly expanding area of research over recent years as\ntechniques and knowledge have developed. Materials often possess unique characteristics\nwhen in a nanoscale form as compared to bulk materials and as such, the incorporation into\nexisting techniques is an active area of research to enhance sensitivity and selectivity. For\nexample, the benefits of using such materials as carbon nanotubes are that they display\nenhanced detection sensitivity compared to sensors incorporating other carbon platforms\n(possibly due to increased surface area,) they have electrocatalytic effects, are mechanically\nstrong and flexible and have excellent electrical and thermal conductivity. Nanoparticle\nsystems have also been used such as metal nanoparticles, again they can lead to enhanced\nsensitivities especially in electrochemical systems due to increased surface areas, catalytic\neffects and improving electrical conductivity. Metal nanoparticles can also have beneficial\neffects in optical sensors due to increased surface areas and a number of optical effects\nsuch as surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy, described later in this section.\n5.1. Molecularly imprinted polymers\n5.1.1. Principle\nMolecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are generated through both covalent and\nnon-covalent interactions of functional monomers with the molecule of interest or its\nanalogues, acting as a template. Figure 4 shows schematically the formation of a MIP by\ncrosslinking around a template. MIPs allow the formation of molecules with recognition sites\nspecific for a target analyte producing a substance specific coating which may then be\nincorporated onto a sensing platform. MIPs are stable and robust which accounts for the\ninterest in researching possible uses for them as sensing materials. A more extensive review\ninto the use and synthesis of these polymers can be found in the literature [109].\nThe proposal of MIPs for the detection of explosive compounds was first described by\nChianella et al, 2004 [110], where MIPs were designed for PETN, RDX, Tetryl and TNT. A\npatent filed by Schwartz et al, 2005, described an array of MIP coated fibre-optic cables\nwhich, when coupled to a suitable algorithm program, is capable of identifying either single\nor multiple explosive target molecules [111].\n5.1.2. Recent advances\nMore recently, research has been undertaken into the optimisation of polymerisation\ntechniques and assessing the merit of various monomers for the synthesis and subsequent\nspecificity towards explosives compounds. Bunte et al, 2007, described the comparison of\nvarious monomer\/solvent complexes and the use of a spray gun, alongside conventional\ntechniques, to apply the thin film to a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). Response times\nfor TNT vapour were found to be in the pg per \u00b5g MIP per minute range [112]. The same\ngroup, based at the Fraunhofer Institute for Chemical Technology, described further work\ninto MIP application using both a nanoplotter and a spin coating device to assess the\nresulting quality of the layers [113] as well as the use of a continuous segmented flow\nmicroreaction process to allow uniform sized pre-polymer droplets to be generated. This\nenabled the size required to be defined, so minimising the need to sieve before use in\ncolumns [114].\nStringer et al, 2010, described the use of quantum dots as the fluorescent species in a\nfluorescent-labelled MIP system. The quantum dots, rather than being incorporated into the\npolymer matrix, were inserted post-processing to extend the shelf-life of the system. Lower\nlimits of detection were found to be 30.1 and 40.7 \u00b5mol L-1 for aqueous DNT and TNT,\nrespectively [115]. Whilst this system was unable to match detection limits of other MIP\nbased detection techniques [116], response times were found to be as low as 1 minute.\nNie et al, 2011, described a two dimensional approach to molecular imprinting for the\ndetection of TNT. This two-dimensional approach was expected to improve limitations such\nas incomplete template removal and slow mass transfer associated with traditional MIP. The\nmolecularly imprinted monolayer, MIM, was prepared upon a Au nanoparticle modified\nglassy carbon electrode (AuNP-GCE) to enable electrochemical detection of TNT. TNT\ntemplates were preadsorbed on the surface of the AuNP-GCE the alkanethiols then\nself-assemble before removal of templates. These MIMs were found to have good selectivity\ntowards TNT above other nitroaromatic compounds with a detection limit of 3 \u00b5g L-1 and this\nenabled the system to be successfully applied to environmental water samples [117].\n5.2. Nanotubes\nThe unique properties of nanotubes have generated great interest towards the study and\ndevelopment of this field of research. These include, for example, their electrical properties\nas either conductors, insulators or semiconductors, depending on the structure and their\nhigh thermal conductivity in the axial direction while their thermal conductivity is low in the\nlateral direction. There are many more examples of their unique kinetic, optical and\nmechanical properties that ensure this area of study is continually expanding [118].\nWang et al, 2004, reported the surface modification of glassy carbon electrodes with\nmulti-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) for the detection of TNT with adsorptive stripping\nvoltammetry (ASV). Modification of the electrode in this manner aided the accumulation of\nTNT at the electrode surface due to the increased surface area. This resulted in\nquantification of TNT down to the sub-\u00b5g L-1 level and a LOD of 0.6 \u00b5g L-1 [119]. It was also\ndiscovered that this system performed better in a seawater matrix, with increased sensitivity\nwhen compared to a synthetic NaCl solution. A number of issues with selectivity were\nreported, however, since other nitroaromatic compounds were found capable of interference.\nChen et al, 2010, reported the use of semiconducting single walled carbon nanotubes\n(SWCNT) as wearable chemical sensors, firstly positioning the SWCNT in an aligned array\non quartz using chemical vapour deposition and then transferring the array onto textile. This\ncoated textile section was then incorporated onto a chip carrier with an electrical and gas\nfeed, essentially becoming a wearable transistor. In air, the LOD for TNT was found to be 8\nppb (80 ng L-1). The same group also reported the production of metal oxide nanowires with\na LOD for TNT vapour of 600 ng L-1 [120].\nA SWCNT based chemiresistive immunosensor was described by Park et al, 2010, which\nprovided a label-free, sensitive and selective technique for detection of nitroaromatic\nexplosives. The SWCNT was first modified with trinitrophenyl (TNP), an analogue of TNT,\nwhich was then functionalised with an anti-TNP single chain antibody. This antibody has a\ngreater affinity for TNT and thus the introduction of TNT caused a large change in the\nresistance of the system with the detection range of 5 ng L-1 to 50 \u03bcg L-1 TNT in PBS and\nenvironmental water samples being reported [121].\nAs previously mentioned, detection of peroxide based explosives can be complex due to\nthese compounds containing neither the nitro groups nor aromatic behaviours traditionally\nused for analysis [122]. Banerjee et al, 2009, suggested the use of a one-dimensional titania\n(TiO2) nanotube array where metal ions, in this case zinc (Zn2+), are coated upon the\nsurface. When present in argon the TATP vapour bonded to the metal ions and the signal\ncurrent output, as detected by a potentiostat, increased by between 3 to 5 orders of\nmagnitude although this was found to be prone to saturation for TATP in air under ambient\nconditions [123].\nThe use of both carbon nanotubes and metallic nanoparticles were described by Hrapovic et\nal, 2006, for the electrochemical detection of nitroaromatic compounds. The nanocomposite\nwas composed of a SWCNT with copper nanoparticles within a Nafion matrix, selected for\ntheir stability, reproducibility, low background current and prominent peak display with cyclic\nvoltammetry and anodic stripping voltammetry, ASV. A detection limit of 1 \u03bcg L-1 was\nreported in tap water, river water and washed contaminated soil samples [124].\nGuo et al, 2011, reported the development of an ionic liquid graphene nanosheet used with\na glassy carbon electrode for the detection of TNT. The nanosheets were synthesised as\ndescribed by [125] and used to detect the presence of TNT as it was electrochemically\nreduced. Comparison data illustrated a distinct improvement in signal when compared to\nplain glassy carbon electrodes or those functionalised with ionic liquid carbon nanotubes;\nand a detection limit of 4 \u03bcg L-1 in PBS was reported [126].\n5.3. Nanoparticles\nJiang et al, 2008, described a simple colorimetric visualisation of TNT at picomolar levels\nbased on the donar-acceptor (D-A) interaction between TNT and primary amines \u2013 in this\ncase cysteamine. The cysteamine acts as both primary amine and stabilizer to the gold\nnanoparticles (Au NP); introduction of TNT into the aqueous solution caused aggregation of\nthese amine covered Au NPs which resulted in a colour change from red to violet which can\nbe observed without further analysis. An addition of 114 pg L-1 of TNT changed the solution\ncolour such that it could be visualised by the naked eye [127].\nSurface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is a technique that enhances the intensity of\nRaman scattering spectra through the proximity of a molecule to a roughened metal surface\nor, in the case of nanomolecules, between gaps in nanostructures. Dasary et al, 2009,\ndescribed a SERS probe coated with gold nanoparticle-cysteine conjugates; this system was\nable to form aggregating Meisenheimer complexes in water in the presence of TNT. A result\nof this was hot spot formation and an enhancement of the Raman signal intensity, allowing\nTNT to be detected at a concentration of 0.45 ng L-1 [128]\u2026A similar technique was\ndescribed by Yang et al, 2010, using functionalised silver nanoparticles coated on silver\nmolybdate nanowires with crosslinking provided by p,p\u2019-dimercaptoazobenzene (DMAB).\nTNT was detected in this case at concentrations of 0.23 ng L-1 [129]. The detection of\nperoxide based explosives has also been described using a similar approach. Chang et al,\n2009, reported a SERS-active nanoporous substrate based on porous alumina membranes\ncombined with mixed nanoclusters comprising gold nanorods and gold nanoparticles. The\nplasmon resonance from hot spots produced by the above system photo-decompose\nmolecules of HMTD enabling analysis of the fragments. The LOD has been interpolated as 2\npg HMTD in 10 \u03bcL of acetonitrile [130]. A self-assembled gold octahedral array has been \ndescribed that used a droplet evaporation process. This process produced a nanoparticle\narray with nanoscale interparticle gaps which provide an enhancement to the SERS\ndetection of TNT deposited from ethanol solution through improved sensitivity and\nreproducibility [131]. There has been significant work within this area to establish optimal\nworking conditions of the system including, for example, the effect of exposure time and\ntemperature on the resulting signal [132, 133] as well as addressing false positives due to\nmusk based perfumes of similar structure to TNT [134], in this case it was found that the\ncompounds musk ketone and musk xylene can be distinguished from TNT using the SERS\ntechnique.\nAn imprinted composite coating of bisaniline-gold nanoparticles was developed using\nKemp\u2019s acid as an imprinting molecule upon a gold surface for the detection of RDX. This\ntechnique used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) which reveals changes in the refractive\nindex occurring due to adsorption or desorption at the surface. Detection of RDX was\npossible at 2.6 pg L-1 in HEPES buffer due to the formation of \u03c0-donor-acceptor complexes \nbetween RDX and the bisaniline bridging units [135]. Kawaguchi et al, 2008, describe the\nuse of gold nanoparticles on the immunosurface within a miniaturised SPR system that\namplified the signal for TNT by four times that which is seen when the gold nanoparticle was\nabsent [136].\nWang et al, 2008, reported electrochemical competitive displacement immunoassays for the\ndetection of TNT. Poly(guanine)-functionalised silica nanoparticles were complexed with\nanti-TNT coated magnetic beads using an analogue of TNT, trinitrobenzene. When exposed\nto TNT the analogue was displaced and there was an increase of guanine in the solution.\nThe magnetic beads were removed and the solution electrochemically interrogated upon a\nscreen printed electrode in a solution of PBS with mediator. The limit of detection for this\nsystem was found to be ~100 ng L-1 [137].\nChen et al, 2010, described a chemosensor based on pyrene-functionalised Ru (ruthenium)\nnanoparticles, using 1-vinylpyrene (Ru=VPy) and 1-allylpyrene (Ru=APy). Both of these\nparticles exhibited enhanced detection of nitroaromatic compounds in dimethylformamide as\ncompared to monomeric pyrene; and of the two particles under examination Ru=VPy\nnanoparticles displayed higher sensitivity. Increased nitration on the aromatic ring increased\nthe response, and for this reason TNT exhibited the greatest fluorescence quenching of the\nnitroaromatics under consideration [138].\n6. Quartz crystal Microbalance\n6.1.1. Principle\nThe quartz crystal microbalance utilises the resonance frequency change due to changes in\nmass upon the crystal surface as a means to detect the presence of a substance of interest.\nThis technique is further enhanced through coating the surface with various compounds\nwhich help provide specificity to this system. Although this paper will relate the use of a QCM\nin relation to the field of nanotechnology, the reader is referred to a comprehensive review of\nthe many uses of QCM [139].\n6.1.2. Recent advances\nLarsson et al, 2006, reported a potential selective detector chip for TNT using thiol\nself-assembly with a TNT analogue upon a gold biochip and a subsequent competitive label-\nfree immunoassay. Several combinations of TNT analogue\/organosulphur compounds were\nevaluated as a possible self-assembled monolayer (SAM) for this system and the analogue\ndissociation was monitored with both a QCM and via surface plasmon resonance (SPR).\nThe detection limit for TNT was within the 1-10 \u00b5g L-1 range in PBS depending on the\nTNT-analogue used [140], with one analogue, ANA1, presenting shorter recovery times after\nexposure and a higher relative response to TNT.\nCerruti et al, 2009, further investigated the selective detection of TNT and DNT using QCM\nwith a polymer-oligopeptide coating upon a gold chip capable of providing a stable and high\ndensity set of receptors with selective binding capabilities. This system was capable of\nproviding real-time detection, in water, of TNT whilst the presence of DNT exhibited no\nresonance frequency change [141]. A different approach by Lubczyk et al, 2010, was to\ncombine several differently coated microbalances in an array to distinguish the peroxide\nbased explosive TATP from chemically related compounds. Analytical detection methods for\nTATP often rely on the detection of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as an indicator of its presence;\nhowever, as H2O2 can be found in other substances there is a risk of false positives from\nmerely detecting this substance. This work attempted to address this issue using a\ncombination of a modified phenylene dendrimer, a cyclodextrin and a cholic acid derivative\nas the separate coatings on an array of QCMs. Response times were found to be in the\nrange of a few seconds and rapid system recovery was also possible. Combining this\napproach with high frequency QCM a lower limit of detection for TATP vapour in nitrogen\nwas reported at 1 ppm (6.6 \u03bcg L-1) [142].\nYu et al, 2009, described a combination of electrochemical and piezoelectrical transduction\ntechniques for the sensitive and selective detection of nitroaromatic compounds. This\nsystem used an ionic liquid, BMIBF4, as both the electrolyte for the amperometric sensing\nand the sorption solvent to coat the QCM. The amperometric and QCM sensing systems\nwere integrated onto a single quartz chip permitting miniaturisation. Sensing was performed\nin the 0-70 \u03bcg L-1 region for ethylnitrobenzene, validating the combination of these two\nsystems and the use of ionic liquids as both solvent and electrolyte in a miniaturised system\nsuch as this [90].\n7. Thin Films Sensors\nThe design of selective polymers for the detection of explosive compounds has been\ndescribed earlier. Tenhaeff et al, 2010, employed initiated chemical vapour deposition\n(iCVD) to deposit a nitro-aromatic selective polymer, poly(4-vinylpyridine), inside\nmicrofabricated trenches. This coating was subsequently coated with a gold\/palladium\nelectrically conductive layer. When the polymer coating absorbed the analyte vapour of\ninterest it swelled producing an interaction between the conductive layers on either side of\nthe trough and this contact can subsequently be measured electrically. Although this system\ndemonstrated the transduction of a chemical interaction into an observable measurement,\nthere were several issues that would need to be addressed before translation into a viable\ndetection device, such as the switch presently being irreversible and the length of response\ntimes \u2013 the shortest for nitrobenzene being 10.2 minutes. The authors do, however, claim\nconcentration and mass limits of detection for TNT as low as 9.5 ng L-1 and 3 fg respectively\nthrough modelling based on optimal conditions [143].\nLong et al, 2009, reported an electrospun nanofibrous film doped with a fluorescent\nconjugated polymer (CP) for the detection of DNT in chloroform. CPs have greater\nfluorescent quantum yields and amplified sensory responses as compared to small\nfluorescent molecules, although they experience self-aggregation and thus self fluorescent\nquenching. The authors employed electrospinning to construct a nanofibrous film that\ndecreased opportunities for self-aggregation. The polymer was further doped with a\nsupporting matrix and a porogen to increase the surface area and porosity of the surface;\nthis enabled target analytes to diffuse close to the sensing elements so increasing the\nquenching capabilities [144].\nLock et al, 2009, described the use of a self-assembled monolayer upon the surface of a\nmicrocantilever, which undergoes chain polymerisation in the presence of peroxide radicals\nwhich are produced when the sample vapours are passed through a heating filament. This\nsensor was capable of detecting hydrogen peroxide and tertbutyl peroxide, leading to the\nhope that it may be suitable for use within a peroxide explosive sensor. This system also\ndisplayed reversibility, returning to baseline without need for thermal regeneration [145] and\nwas reported as being selective to peroxide vapours, although this may not be sufficiently\ndiscriminating to prevent some false positives.\n8. Conclusions and future outlook\nIt can be observed that almost all analytical techniques addressed in this review have\nundergone significant changes to improve one or more aspects of their working practises\nover the last five years; including, for example: sensitivity, specificity, cost, ease of use and\nminiaturisation. Further advancement will be necessary to provide a system that\nincorporates all aspects of an ideal explosive identification technique due to the inherent\nissues that are associated with this \u2013 low volatility of explosive vapours, concealment,\ninterferences and the actual damage caused by a false response. Significant improvements\nhave been made in the portability of apparatus; spectroscopic techniques, such as IMS and\nmass spectrometry, which were largely stationary are now become field deployable.\nTerahertz spectroscopy, once beleaguered with issues, has been realised as a technique\nthat can identify explosives and other concealed objects beneath clothing and within\nluggage. Nanotechnology over the last decade has become increasingly important, with\nresearch to incorporate new nano-based aspects into existing technologies to improve\nsensitivity, selectivity and portability.\nWe have within this review discussed many of the applications that require explosive\ndetection and the capabilities of some of the current commercial systems are shown in table\n1. There appear to be many promising methods that are being developed as alternatives to\nthese systems and the utilisation of these various technologies will depend on the particular\napplication. For applications that require not only high sensitivity but also an immediate\nresponse, such as airport security, the most promising systems appear to those based on\neither mass spectroscopy which is the basis of many of the detection systems currently in\nuse. These offer a rapid response and can detect low levels of most explosive materials, as\nwell as many other hazardous chemicals. Other technologies that could compete with these\nare optical systems, such as those using conjugated fluorescent polymers which could\nmatch the sensitivity and speed of response, although it is unlikely that they would be able to\ndetect as wide a range of analytes. Some of the nanotechnology based methods, utilising for\nexample carbon nanotubes which may display rapid changes in conductivity on adsorption of\nvapours of interest may also be suitable, although one challenge is the selectivity of such\nsystems.\nFor detection of explosive devices in other environments (landmines, roadside bombs etc)\nthe most important factor is probably the ability to detect at a safe distance, rather than\nhaving to approach the device. Of great interest therefore are optical laser-based techniques\nsuch as the Raman systems described earlier which allow detection of explosives at stand-\noff distances as high as 180 metres. They are also of interest because of their ability to\ndetect explosives in sealed containers such as glass or plastic bottles.\nFor forensic investigations and environmental monitoring, rapid detection is usually not a\nmatter of such urgency so other techniques can compete. In the case of forensic\nexamination, most of this is still lab based but the techniques used such as mass\nspectrometry are becoming much smaller and in some cases are portable. One challenge for\nenvironmental monitoring is that usually large areas can be involved, such as river basins\nand this means a large number of samples may be required. Laboratory based techniques\nare often expensive and require trained personnel, leading to cost and time issues. It is in\nthis context that the use of such methods as biosensors or molecular imprinted polymers\nbecome suitable. They display high selectivity and specificity and can often be made\ncheaply, for example the use of cheap screen-printed electrodes has allowed the\nconstruction of disposable one-shot biosensors, as typified by commercial home glucose\nsensors. Utilisation of this technology will allow the measurement of large number of\nsamples at a much reduced cost, with the possibility that they could be used as a screening\nprocess. Large areas could be investigated to determine location of areas of high\ncontamination which can then be sampled for in depth off-site analysis.\nThe field of explosives detection is certain to remain and active and wide-ranging area of\nresearch due to increased demand for homeland security in the face of perceived terrorist\nthreats as well the remediation of environments that already pose a high risk \u2013 such as\nclearing of minefields. One of the most important aspects of these technologies is that of\nportability and much research is being undertaken into the miniaturisation of existing\ntechnologies. Nanotechnology has an important role to play in this as well as also enabling\nthe development of new technologies. Improving the sensitivity and specificity of explosive\ndetection technology are principles that continue to be important; lower detection limits for\nmany materials have improved considerably and work in this area remains a competitive\nfield of research.\n9.
