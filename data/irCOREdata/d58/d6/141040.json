INTRODUCTION28\nMagnetic ion-exchange (MIEX\u00ae) resin has emerged as an effective technology for29\ntreating waters containing natural organic matter (NOM). The principle driver for30\nusing the resin has been to increase removal of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to31\nreduce the disinfection by-product (DBP) formation of a water when compared to32\nusing conventional coagulation alone. Use of the resin as a pre-treatment before33\ncoagulation has consistently shown a reduction in DBP formation when compared to34\nconventional coagulation (Singer and Bilyk, 2002; Fearing et al., 2004; Hamann et35\nal., 2004; Son et al., 2005). These studies have shown significant reduction in key36\nDBPs of between 50-70 % for trihalomethanes (THMs) and >60 % for haloacetic37\nacids (HAAs) when compared to single coagulation alternatives.38\n39\nMagnetic ion-exchange resin is a strong base anion resin with ammonia functional40\ngroups, consisting of 150-180 \u00b5m beads of a macroporous, polyacrylic structure41\n(Slunjski et al. 2000; Singer & Bilyk 2002). During the operation of the continuous42\nresin process, NOM rich raw water is contacted with the resin allowing ion-exchange43\nof organics onto the resin. The high density and magnetic properties of the resin44\nprovides rapid clarification following the contact stage. Between 90-95 % of the resin45\nis recycled back in to the contactor, with the remainder regenerated with a46\nconcentrated brine solution (Budd et al., 2003). Depending on specific water47\ncharacteristics, magnetic resin pre-treatment can remove from 30 % to over 70 % of48\nthe DOC from the water (Wert et al., 2005; Tan et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2005). The49\ntreated water therefore has a much lower coagulant demand allowing much lower50\ndoses to be applied when compared to conventional coagulation of the same raw51\nwater (Fearing et al., 2004; Allpike et al., 2005; Boyer and Singer, 2005). For52\nexample, Fearing et al. (2004) showed better DOC and UV254 removals (75 % and 9553\n% respectively) by reducing the coagulant dose from 14 mg L-1 to 5 mg L-1 as Fe54\n(ferric sulphate) when using magnetic resin pre-treatment (20 mL L-1 for 20 minutes).55\n56\nWhilst the position with regard to reduced DBP formation using magnetic resin is57\nclear, the current position with regard to the types of organic material preferentially58\nremoved by the resin is unclear. This is because NOM is a highly variable matrix that59\ncan differ temporally and spatially and is highly dependent on the catchment feeding60\nthe water body (Vogt et al., 2004). Some work has shown that the resin is more61\neffective at removing NOM from waters that have a high specific UV254 absorbance62\n(SUVA) of > 3.0 L m-1 mg-1 DOC, but is also able to remove hydrophilic fractions of63\nNOM (Johnson and Singer, 2004; Boyer and Singer, 2005). Other work has shown64\nthat magnetic resin does not remove very large organic molecules >5000 Daltons65\n(Fearing et al., 2004) or small neutral organics (Kim et al., 2005). Removal analysis66\nof different molecular weight (MW) NOM fractions after resin treatment has shown67\nthat high MW compounds (5000-7000 Daltons (Da)) composed of hydrophobic humic68\nand fulvic compounds were poorly removed following resin treatment (Allpike et al.,69\n2005). However, good removal was seen for smaller anionic species, thought to70\ncontain carboxylic groups. This is in agreement with Humbert et al. (2005), who have71\nshown that intermediate MW organics between 500-1500 Daltons were well removed72\nby the resin.73\n74\nWith new magnetic ion-exchange plants being continuously installed, there is a strong75\nneed for further research into the types of organic material that can be removed by the76\nresin. The objectives of this work were to provide a view on the treatment efficiency77\nof using resin pre-treatment on three different raw waters: (1) an algal laden surface78\nreservoir water; (2) a hydrophilic lowland river water and (3) a hydrophobic highly79\ncoloured moorland water. These results were compared with other literature removal80\nperformance data to determine which types of water are suitable for resin pre-81\ntreatment. The NOM removal efficiencies using a) conventional coagulation and b)82\nmagnetic resin treatment followed by coagulation were compared for each of the83\ndifferent waters.84\n85\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS86\n2.1 Raw water characterisation87\nThree raw waters from across the UK of fundamentally different character were88\nanalysed, these were:89\n1) Barcombe \u2013 an algae laden reservoir water90\n2) Draycote \u2013 a hydrophilic lowland river water91\n3) Albert \u2013 a hydrophobic moorland surface water92\nRaw water was collected and characterised by measuring raw water dissolved organic93\nconcentration (DOC) (Shimadzu 500A TOC analyser), ultraviolet absorbance at 25494\nnm (UV254) (Jenway 6505 UV\/vis spectrophotometer), turbidity (Hach 210095\nturbidimeter) and zeta potential (Malvern Zetasizer). All analytical instruments were96\ncalibrated using the associated calibration procedure for the insutrument prior to use97\nand have an associated analytical error of approximately \u00b15 %. High performance size98\nexclusion chromatography (HPSEC) analysis was carried out using a Shimadzu VP99\nseries high performance liquid chromatogram (HPLC) using UV254 detection. The100\nmobile phase was 0.1 M sodium acetate flowing at 1 mL min-1. A TSK-gel G3000SW101\n7.5 mm (internal diameter (ID)) by 30 cm column was used with a TSK gel 7.5 (ID)102\nmm by 30 mm guard column (Tosoh Biosep GmbH, Stuttgart, Germany). The system103\nwas calibrated with 110 mL of source water filtered through ultra filtration104\nmembranes at different molecular weight cut-offs (MWCO). Membranes with105\nMWCO values of 0.5, 1, 3, 5, 10 and 30 kDa were used (YM1-YM30, Millipore Pty106\nLtd., Massachusetts, USA, YC05, Millipore Pty Ltd., Sydney, Australia). Samples107\nwere analysed un-filtered for turbidity and zeta potential and were filtered using a108\nglass fibre paper (<1 \uf06dm pore size, Munktell, Sweden) for DOC, UV254 and HPSEC109\nanalysis.110\n111\nFurther characterisation work was carried out by fractionating raw waters using112\npublished methods (Malcolm and MacCarthy, 1992; Goslan et al., 2002). During this113\nprocess, 2 L of raw water was filtered through 0.45 \uf06dm glass fibre papers and114\nacidified to pH 2. The water was then passed through two fractionation columns, the115\nfirst containing 60 mL of XAD-8 resin and the second containing 60 mL of XAD-4116\nresin. Effluent passing through both of the columns was the hydrophilic non-acid117\nfraction (HPINA). Both the ion-exchange columns were back eluted with 250 mL of118\n0.1 M NaOH. The eluate from the XAD-8 column was the hydrophobic fraction. The119\npH of this sample was adjusted to 1 using concentrated HCl and allowed to settle for120\n24 hours before being centrifuged. The supernatant was decanted; this was the fulvic121\nacid fraction (FAF). The residual was dissolved in 100 mL of 0.1 M NaOH; this was122\nthe humic acid fraction (HAF). The eluate from the XAD-4 resin was the hydrophilic123\nacid fraction (HPIA). The fractions were filtered and analysed for DOC.124\n125\nThe charge density of raw and treated water was measured using a methodology as126\ndescribed in Sharp et al. (2006). Briefly, the charge of water was determined using the127\nMalvern Zetasizer and 0.1 % polyDADMAC (Sigma-Aldrich, UK). 1 L of water was128\nstirred with a magnetic stirrer and varying amounts of polyDADMAC were added to129\nthe water until the point of zero charge had been reached (as measured by the130\nZetasizer). This was then repeated twice. The volume of polyDADMAC added was131\nused to determine raw water charge and normalised to the charge density per g of132\nDOC in the water.133\n134\n2.2 Magnetic resin dosing135\nA new bench scale approach was used to assess the performance of magnetic resin as136\ndescribed in Mergen et al. (2006) in order to more appropriately mirror how the resin137\nis used operationally. In most bench scale magnetic resin testing protocols, fresh or138\nregenerated resin has been used singularly in batch tests before analysis on the treated139\nwater is carried out. Whilst useful information can be found from these tests, this does140\nnot reflect how the resin will be used at full scale. Given that between 5-10 % of used141\nresin is replaced with regenerated resin during the continuous operation of a magnetic142\nresin unit, used resin is continuously in contact with untreated water with only a small143\nfraction of fresh\/regenerated resin added (Slunjski et al., 2000). In this way, the resin144\nachieves service runs equivalent to 1250-2500 bed volumes (BV). In these145\nexperiments, resin was contacted with raw water in individual jar tests for 15146\nconsecutive times without regeneration to give an equivalent resin BV of 1500. Resin147\ndoses were prepared by adding the required resin doses in to measuring cylinders and148\nallowed to settle for 2 hours. Any adjustments to the required resin dose were made149\nby adding or removing resin using a plastic pipette. Resin was added to 1 L of raw150\nwater and mixed on a jar tester at 150 rpm. After each jar test, the treated water was151\nsettled from the resin for 5 minutes and the supernatant poured-off and combined in to152\none large sample containing water from each consecutive jar test. Subsequent jar tests153\nwere carried out with the same used resin with further 1 L samples of raw water added154\nto the settled resin and mixed on the jar tester as before. Analysis and further155\nexperimentation was carried out on both the combined water and the separated water.156\nThe combined water was then considered as being equivalent to that produced from157\nan operational magnetic resin works.158\n159\nSamples were analysed after each separate jar test and for the combined water for160\nDOC removal and HPSEC. Quality assurance of these results was confirmed by161\nnoting good agreement between the prediction of the DOC in the combined sample162\nfrom the individual jar tests and that given by the measured DOC in the combined163\nsample: 88 % of predictions were within \u00b1 5 % of the observed DOC removal. The164\nremaining 12 % of samples were 5.2, 5.5 and 8.0 % different.165\n166\nThe combined water sample was then coagulated using ferric sulphate (Ferripol XL,167\nEA West) on a jar tester. During coagulation, raw or resin pre-treated water was168\nstirred at 200 rpm for 1.5 minutes following the addition of ferric sulphate and the pH169\nadjusted using 1 M NaOH. After the rapid mix, the jars were stirred at 30 rpm for 15170\nminutes followed by a 15 minute settling period before water samples were taken for171\nanalysis. The efficacy of coagulation after resin pre-treatment was compared to direct172\ncoagulation of the raw water under optimised coagulation conditions.173\n174\nThe magnetic resin and coagulant doses reported were found as the optimums during175\npreliminary experiments using standard jar testing procedure. Resin was dosed at 10176\nmL L-1 for 10 minutes for all of the raw waters with a subsequent coagulant dose of 2177\nmg L-1 Fe for Barcombe and Draycote waters and 4 mg L-1 Fe for Albert water.178\nConventional coagulation tests used optimum doses of 10 mg L-1 Fe for all three179\nwaters.180\n181\n2.3 Comparison of magnetic resin removal data182\nThe removal of NOM using magnetic resin observed in this work was compared to183\nother data to determine if general water quality parameters could be used to identify184\nthe potential of removing DOC from a water using the resin. The studies used in this185\ncomparison have been summarised in Table 1. Studies using resin in batch scale186\nstudies were differentiated from studies using the resin in continuous operation187\n(including full-scale, pilot scale and the methodology used here). The NOM removal188\nusing magnetic resin was normalised to a percentage removal of DOC and plotted189\nagainst raw water parameters of DOC, SUVA, hydrophobicity from XAD190\nfractionation and alkalinity. It was assumed that optimum resin operating conditions191\nwere used in the data extracted from other sources.192\n193\n3. RESULTS194\n3.1 Raw water characterisation195\nThe three raw waters investigated showed very different physico-chemical properties196\n(Table 2). Whilst all waters were of similar DOC content (9.4 \u2013 10.7 mg L-1), the197\ngreater UV254 absorbance of 60.1 m-1 for Albert water reflected the more highly198\ncoloured nature of this water in comparison to Barcombe and Draycote (16.5 and 13.9199\nm-1 respectively). Both Draycote and Albert were low turbidity waters (<1.8 NTU),200\nwhilst Barcombe had a high turbidity of 13.1 NTU as a result of this water containing201\nhigh concentrations of algae. Microscopic examination identified that the dominant202\nspecies in this water were green algae (Chlorella and Scenedesmus).203\n204\nWater hydrophobicity was measured in two ways. Firstly, the SUVA provides a quick205\nindication of the nature of the organics present in the raw water. The high SUVA of206\nAlbert water (6.4 L m-1 mg-1 DOC) was indicative of a hydrophobic water whilst the207\nlow SUVA values of <1.8 L m-1 mg-1 DOC for Barcombe and Draycote were208\nindicative of containing mostly hydrophilic organics.209\n210\nMore detailed hydrophobicity characterisation was made using XAD resin211\nfractionation (Figure 1). This showed that the high SUVA Albert water contained a212\nhigh proportion of hydrophobic substances (humic and fulvic fractions) with over 75213\n% of the total DOC determined to be hydrophobic. The water having the lowest214\nSUVA (Draycote) was confirmed to contain mostly hydrophilic compounds215\n(hydrophilic acid and non-acid fractions) with over 75 % of the total DOC216\nhydrophilic. However, whilst the SUVA of Barcombe water suggested that there was217\na low hydrophobic content, 50 % of the water was determined to be hydrophobic after218\nfractionation, indicating that this water contained a large proportion of non-UV254219\nabsorbing hydrophobic compounds that the SUVA measurement was not able to220\nidentify.221\n222\nThe charge density of the raw waters tracked the fractionation hydrophobicity data,223\nwith the more hydrophobic waters containing more highly charged material per mass224\nof organic in the water. The very hydrophobic Albert water had the highest225\nconcentration of negatively charged organics (6.4 meq g-1 DOC) whilst the part226\nhydrophilic\/hydrophobic Barcombe water had an intermediate charge density of 1.9227\nmeq g-1 DOC. The hydrophilic Draycote water had a low charge density of only 0.3228\nmeq g-1 DOC. As a result of the high proportion of hydrophilic acids determined from229\nfractionation in Draycote water, it may have been expected that this water would have230\nhad a higher charge density. However, this result was observed on repetition of the231\nmeasurement.232\n233\nThe MW distribution of the UV254 absorbing compounds also showed a relationship234\nwith the hydrophobicity and charge density data (Figure 2). The highly charged and235\ncoloured hydrophobic Albert water contained organics with much greater UV254236\nabsorbance with an area under the curve over four times that of Draycote and237\nBarcombe. Albert water had a higher MW distribution of UV254 absorbing organics238\ncompared to Barcombe and Draycote with two major peaks at 6 and 8 minutes elution239\ntime. Calibration of the column with source water filtered through ultra filtration240\nmembranes at different molecular weight cut-offs, approximated these peaks as being241\n>5000 Daltons (Da). The part hydrophobic\/hydrophilic Barcombe water had more242\nhigh MW UV254 organic compounds than Draycote with a dominant peak between243\n8.5-9 minutes, representing organics between 2000-5000 Da. The hydrophilic244\nDraycote water had the lowest MW with a more even distribution of organics around245\na main peak at 9.5 minutes, approximating to organics of 2000 Da.246\n247\nGiven that the DOC content of the three waters was similar, the low level of UV254248\nabsorbance for Draycote and Barcombe indicated that a large portion of the organics249\nin these waters could not be characterised using UV254 detection. For this reason,250\nsubsequent discussion of data generated from UV254 detection has been limited to the251\nstrongly absorbing Albert water.252\n253\n3.2 Removals254\nDOC removals of 56, 33 and 25 % were observed during consecutive magnetic resin255\ntreatment for Draycote, Barcombe and Albert waters respectively in the final256\ncombined water (Figure 3).257\n258\nWhen resin treated water was subsequently combined with coagulation using low259\ncoagulant doses, the combined resin + coagulation systems gave between 2-8 %260\nimproved DOC removal when compared to conventional coagulation. The small261\nincrease in removal was close to the limit of error on the instrument used for DOC262\nanalysis, therefore some uncertainty was assigned to the conclusion that the combined263\nsystem led to improved NOM removal. The benefit of coagulation after resin pre-264\ntreatment was greatest for increasing water hydrophobicity, with increased DOC265\nremoval of 8, 45 and 63 % seen for Draycote, Barcombe and Albert respectively.266\n267\nAnalysis of the HPSEC traces of UV254 absorbing organics for Albert water showed a268\nsmall reduction in the peak at 6 minutes elution time after resin treatment, identified269\nby a 14 % decrease in curve area for organics eluted between 5-6.5 minutes (Figure270\n4). This material was the high MW organics that were >5000 Da. Most organic271\nmaterial was removed by the resin for NOM eluted between 7-9 minutes, with a272\nreduction of 43 % over this range, indicating organics of around 5000 Da. This273\nrepresented removal of a broad range of different MW organics for this water.274\n275\nSubsequent coagulation removed significantly more UV254 absorbing organics for the276\nvery hydrophobic Albert water compared to resin treatment alone. For the residual277\nNOM after magnetic resin treatment, over 95 % of the curve area was removed ,278\nleaving a residual of small MW compounds representing NOM of <2000 Da. In279\ncomparison to coagulation alone, the combined resin and coagulation treatments280\nshowed 46 % less relative curve area for residual UV254 absorbing organics for Albert281\nwater.282\n283\n3.4 Consecutive magnetic resin uses284\nFurther investigation in to the removal of different organics using magnetic resin was285\nassessed by analysing the removal performance of DOC after consecutive resin uses286\nfor single and combined waters (Figure 5). For the combined sample (solid line), this287\nrepresents the DOC of the combined water from the preceding individual jar tests.288\nThe organic removal from the algal laden Barcombe water remained consistently289\naround 30 % after consecutive resin uses resulting in a final DOC removal in the290\ncombined water of 33 %. A similar pattern was seen for the hydrophilic Draycote291\nwater with only a slight drop in the removal of DOC from 64 % after the first use of292\nthe resin to 55 % after 15 resin uses, giving an overall DOC removal of 56 % in the293\nfinal combined water. The behaviour of Albert water was very different. The removal294\ncapacity was initially very high (65 %), but rapidly dropped until only 4 % of the295\nDOC was removed after the fifteenth use (1500 BV) of the resin resulting in a296\nremoval of 25 % in the final combined water. This represents a total load of 90.2,297\n47.5, and 35.3 mg of DOC on to the magnetic resin for Draycote Barcombe, and298\nAlbert respectively.299\n300\nAnalysis of HPSEC profiles for consecutive resin uses was again restricted to Albert301\nwater because this was the only water that was dominated by UV254 absorbing302\ncompounds (Figure 6). There was a rapid decrease in the removal of MW material303\nover the elution range between 7-10 minutes, indicating mostly organics between304\n2000-5000 Da. After a single use of the resin when 65 % of the total DOC had been305\nremoved, over 86 % of the curve area had been removed over this elution range. This306\nwas reduced to 20 % removal after 15 uses of the resin (1500 BV).307\n308\n4. DISCUSSION309\nThe results of this work have been compared with other work to determine which310\nvariables control NOM removal using magnetic resin. The removal efficiency of311\nNOM for the final combined water seen here has been compared to other single batch312\nresin studies for extremes of SUVA investigated in each study (Table 3). The data313\ncontained in this table is for one-off uses of resin in stirred reactors between 1 and 15314\nL. Whilst there have been an appreciable range of different water qualities315\ninvestigated, it can be seen that the removal of NOM after resin treatment was316\ngenerally lower than that seen previously, this was particularly the case for high317\nSUVA waters. This was unlikely to be related to the resin dose or contact time given318\nthat the resin dose used (10 mL L-1) was as high as that used in the comparable work,319\nwhilst contact times above 10 minutes have been shown to offer little increased NOM320\nremoval (Humbert et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2005). One-off uses of resin for treatment321\nof hydrophobic type waters resulted in high DOC removal of between 64-93 % (Table322\n3). For example Fearing et al. (2004) looked at the same hydrophobic Albert water323\nsource as used in this work. Using virgin resin, they achieved 66-82 % DOC removal;324\na result similar to that achieved in this work after 1 use of the resin (65 % DOC325\nremoval), but well above the final removal of 25 % in the combined water. For Albert326\nwater, the methodology adopted in this work gave a better indication of how much327\nNOM could be removed for more realistic resin loadings likely during continuous328\noperation. For the hydrophilic waters, one-off use of the resin has resulted in more329\nvariable DOC removal ranging from 43-79 % depending on the water investigated330\n(Table 3). It was shown in this work that consecutive uses of the resin resulted in331\nmore consistent NOM removal for hydrophilic water types. Therefore, for these332\nwaters, one-off jar tests will give an indication of the likely removal using magnetic333\nresin in continuous operation.334\n335\nFurther comparison of removal data was made with magnetic resin studies where336\nmore detailed water characteristics were given (Figure 7). These figures were337\ngenerated from the studies listed in Table 1. There was no significant relationship338\nbetween raw water DOC and removal: for raw water DOCs of >6 mg L-1 the mean339\nDOC removal was 67.6 \u00b1 15.1 % whilst for waters of DOC <6 mg L-1 the mean DOC340\nremoval was 60.0 \u00b1 22.1 % for single resin use investigations. In continuous systems341\nraw water DOCs of >6 mg L-1 the mean DOC removal was 47.5 \u00b1 19.1 % whilst for342\nwaters of DOC <6 mg L-1 the mean DOC removal was 60.5 \u00b1 15.9 %. This indicated343\nthat due to the spatial and temporal variation in NOM from different sources, a bulk344\nwater variable such as raw water DOC is an unsuitable measure to determine water345\ntreatability using magnetic resin.346\n347\nThere were no clearly defined relationships between removal of NOM with magnetic348\nresin and water hydrophobicity (from SUVA or fractionation), but there was some349\nindication that increasing removal was seen with increasing hydrophobicity for single350\nuse resin studies, whilst in continuous testing, this order was reversed. Waters351\ncontaining SUVA values of <4 L m-1 mg-1 DOC have previously been defined as352\nbeing dominated by hydrophilic compounds (Edzwald, 1993). For one-off use of the353\nresin, when the SUVA of the raw water was >4 L mg m-1 removal was 75.6 \u00b1 10.2 %354\ncompared to 56.8 \u00b1 19.7 % when the SUVA was <4 L m-1 mg-1 DOC. The large355\nstandard deviation of the lower SUVA waters indicated that there was a wider356\nvariation in removals seen in these water types when compared to the higher SUVA357\nwaters. For the continuous systems, there were only two instances when the SUVA358\nwas >4 L m-1 mg-1 DOC, so comparison of the removals was not made.359\n360\nThere was a similar distinction between the average removals for single use resin361\ninvestigations and waters that contained greater or less than 50 % hydrophobic NOM362\nfrom fractionation as was seen for high and low SUVA waters. When more than 50 %363\nof the raw water DOC was hydrophobic, DOC removal with magnetic resin was 71.0364\n\u00b1 7.8 % compared to 49.6 \u00b1 20.5 % for <50 % hydrophobic DOC. For continuous use365\nof the resin, the relationship between the DOC removal and the hydrophobicity366\ndecreased with increasing hydrophobicity from 55 to 25 % (however, these three367\npoints were generated from the continuous bench scale methodology used in this368\nstudy). There was no relationship between the alkalinity of the raw water and the369\nremoval seen with the resin for all of the studies investigated.370\n371\nIn summary, bulk water properties did not provide a clear indication of the potential372\nremoval of NOM by magnetic resin. This relates to the inherent variability in NOM373\ncomposition in different source waters which bulk water measurements, such as those374\ninvestigated, are unable to quantify in detail.375\n376\nIn this work, the NOM that was dominated by hydrophobic NOM showed good initial377\nremoval during the first few uses of resin but subsequently removal efficiency quickly378\ndeclined. Hydrophobic NOM is regarded as being of high MW consisting of humic379\nand fulvic acids (Edzwald, 1993). The reduced removal with resin use was explained380\nby blockage of exchange sites by high MW NOM. This was supported by the HPSEC381\nprofiles from Albert that showed initially good removal of a range of organics, but382\nthis rapidly decreased, particularly the removal of high MW organics. This fraction of383\nNOM therefore had high affinity for the resin because hydrophobic organics contain384\nhigh concentrations of dissociable functional groups that impart negative charge on385\nthe organic material (Ussiri and Johnson, 2004). However, the resin was quickly386\nsaturated or pores of the resin were blocked by the large humic and fulvic acid type387\norganics that dominated Albert water. This is a phenomenon also seen in carbon388\nadsorption, where large MW NOM blocks outer pores, reducing adsorption capacity389\nby preventing smaller organics from adsorbing via smaller internal pores (Ebie et al.,390\n2001; Ding et al., 2006). The operational consequences of this suggest that the resin391\nneeds to be regenerated on a more frequent basis for waters dominated by high MW392\nNOM to ensure enough sites are available for exchange of organics on to the resin.393\n394\nThe dominant hydrophilic compounds in the NOM from Draycote showed more395\nconsistent NOM removal on to the resin. The lower MW distribution of the UV254396\nabsorbing organics indicated that this type of NOM was able to access more of the397\navailable resin surface area (including internal pores) of the resin providing more398\navailable area for more consistent NOM removal when compared to the organics in399\nthe hydrophobic water. This was consistent with other work that has shown that400\nhydrophilic acids are typically characterised by lower MW compounds that can be401\neffectively removed by anionic ion-exchange resins (Bolto et al., 2002). Hydrophilic402\nacids of this type therefore seem very amenable to treatment using magnetic resin and403\nwould provide extended use of the resin during operation when compared to404\nhydrophobic waters. Given that Draycote water had a very low charge density, it was405\nunclear whether the principal mechanism for removal of the hydrophilic compounds406\nwas ion-exchange or a non-charge related mechanism. Fettig (1999) concludes that407\nmost NOM is removed by ion-exchange when using anionic ion-exchange resins.408\nHowever, for smaller MW compounds, surface adsorption becomes more important. It409\nis likely that for the lower MW hydrophilic acids, molecular polarity would encourage410\nexchange and\/or adsorption of these compounds. Given the high removals seen, the411\nuse of charge density as determined from the method used in this work was not412\nconsidered a good indicator of the potential for NOM removal by magnetic resin.413\n414\nThe consistently low NOM removals seen for Barcombe water showed that the resin415\nhad a low affinity for NOM in this water. A combination of size exclusion and low416\ncharge may explain the low levels of NOM removal seen using magnetic resin. Given417\nthat this water was dominated by algae it was probable that this water contained high418\nconcentrations of soluble algogenic matter. This is known to include glycolic acids,419\ncarbohydrates, polysaccharides, amino acids, peptides, organic phosphorous,420\nenzymes, vitamins, hormonal substances, inhibitors and toxins (Her et al., 2004;421\nHenderson et al., 2006). Many of these compounds tend to be uncharged and are422\ntherefore unlikely to have a strong affinity for exchange on to the resin (Allpike et al.,423\n2005). However, it has been shown that algal derived extra-cellular organic matter424\n(EOM) is dependent on species. Algae such as Microcystis aeruginosa produce EOM425\nof negligible charge density, whilst Chlorella vulgaris has EOM with a charge density426\n3.2 meq g-1 DOC (Henderson et al., 2006). As Chlorella was one of the dominant427\nalgae in the water sampled here, this explains why some charge density was measured428\nin this water. Charged compounds such as uronic acid have been shown to constitute a429\nportion of the EOM excreted by algae and are therefore likely to be present in such430\nalgae dominated waters (Hoyer et al., 1985). These acids are typical of the charged,431\nsmall MW that have strong affinity with magnetic resin and explains why some NOM432\nwas removed from this water (Allpike et al., 2005). In addition, large polysaccharides433\nand proteins have been shown to be exuded by microbes and algae (Humbert et al.,434\n2007; Henderson et al., IN PRESS). These compounds have a higher MW than humic435\nand fulvic acids indicating that size exclusion may also play a significant part in the436\npoor removals seen from this water using magnetic resin.437\n438\nMore detailed knowledge of the raw water is required other than variables such as439\nDOC, SUVA or alkalinity to indicate likely removal by magnetic resin. This work has440\nshown that a key variable for removal in a hydrophobic water source was the MW of441\nthe organics in the water. Removal of NOM of between 2000-5000 Da decreased with442\nincreasing resin use. Size exclusion\/blockage was thought to explain the decreased443\nremoval with resin use rather than exhaustion of ion-exchange sites. This was because444\n10 mL of magnetic resin has a total charge capacity of 5 meq (Bourke, 2006).445\nHowever, based on the charge density calculation of the Albert NOM, only 0.39 meq446\nof DOC was removed indicating that exchange sites were far from exhausted. High447\nMW organic matter of algal origin may also explain the limited removal seen for448\nBarcombe water. The consistent removal seen for Draycote water indicated that this449\nwater contained lower MW compounds that could be continuously well removed with450\nincreasing resin use. It is also believed that NOM should be charged for high levels of451\nremoval by magnetic resin, however given the high removals observed for Draycote452\nwater an alternative method is required to determine charge in hydrophilic samples453\ndominated by hydrophilic acids.454\n455\nThe benefit of adding coagulant after resin pre-treatment was also shown in this work.456\nAn additional 8-63 % DOC was removed following coagulation of the combined457\nwaters. This follows the same trend as pilot\/full-scale trials where 15-19 % extra DOC458\nremoval has been seen for coagulation after resin pre-treatment (Allpike et al., 2005;459\nShorrock and Drage, 2006). Increasing additional NOM removal was observed with460\nincreasing hydrophobicity. Sharp et al. (2006) gave a hierarchy that showed that the461\nHPIA and HPINA were the fractions least well removed by coagulation when462\ncompared to hydrophobic compounds. It was therefore unsurprising that the water463\nwith the highest hydrophilic content showed the poorest DOC removal during464\ncoagulation. The refractory NOM that could not be removed by coagulation or465\nmagnetic resin treatment has previously been shown to be small neutral or positively466\ncharged NOM that have fluorescent characteristics similar to proteins (Humbert et al.,467\n2005).468\n469\n5. CONCLUSIONS470\nRemoval of NOM using magnetic resin was water specific. A bench scale protocol471\nwas used that showed hydrophilic dominated waters could be assessed in one-off jar472\ntests, whilst hydrophobic NOM required consecutive resin uses. General water473\nparameters such as DOC did not indicate whether a water would be amenable to474\ntreatment using the resin. Both hydrophilic and hydrophobic NOM can be removed by475\nthe resin, however it appeared that high MW NOM (typical of the NOM found in476\nhydrophobic water sources) quickly saturated or blocked the resin. Therefore MW of477\nthe organics in the NOM plays an important role in determining removal efficiency.478\nWater dominated by hydrophilic acids showed consistently high levels of removal on479\nto the resin. Algogenic NOM was poorly removed because of the increased presence480\nof uncharged organics likely to be composed of mainly carbohydrates and proteins.481\n482\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS483\nThe authors would also like to thank ORICA Watercare who financially supported484\nthis research.485\n486\n6.
