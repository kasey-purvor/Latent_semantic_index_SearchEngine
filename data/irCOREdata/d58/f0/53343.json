Introduction  29 \n The dynamics of Earth\u2019s Van Allen radiation belts are governed by a number of competing 30 \nacceleration and loss mechanisms. Particle fluctuation often coincides with a period of 31 \ndisturbance caused by a geomagnetic storm, with the outer belt flux frequently decreasing during 32 \nstorm onset, followed by a gradual repopulation during the recovery period [Baker et. al., 1986; 33 \nLi et. al., 1997]. However, this is not always the case; Reeves et. al. [2003] found that the post-34 \nstorm outer belt relativistic electron flux levels can increase (seen to occur for 53% of events 35 \nstudied), decrease (19%) or have no significant change (28%), relative to pre-storm levels. The 36 \nflux of the outer belt relativistic electron population at geostationary orbits, defined as having 37 \nenergies >1 MeV, is seen to drop over a period of hours during geomagnetic storms [Onsager et. 38 \nal., 2002]. Multiple mechanisms may contribute to these decreases and it has been shown that 39 \nlosses to the atmosphere are likely to be a contributing factor [Green et. al., 2004; Clilverd et al., 40 \n2006].  41 \n Numerical modeling predicts Relativistic Electron Precipitation (REP) to penetrate into the 42 \natmosphere to altitudes of 40-60 km, lower altitudes than most other magnetospheric particles 43 \nare able to reach [Baker et al., 1987; Callis et al., 1991], depositing large enough amounts of 44 \nenergy so as to dominate all other ionisation sources at this altitude range. REP events can occur 45 \nacross a wide range of timescales, lasting from minutes to hours, or taking the form of a brief 46 \nmicroburst (<1 s) of precipitating electrons. The occurrence of relativistic microbursts has been 47 \nstudied since they were first reported by Brown and Stone [1972], but there are still significant 48 \nunknowns. The first reports of relativistic microbursts (as distinct from those in the tens of keV 49 \nrange) appear to have been made by the S81-1 satellite [Imhoff et al., 1992]. Observations from 50 \nthe Solar Anomalous Magnetospheric Particle Explorer (SAMPEX) have helped to determine 51 \nsome characteristics of REP microbursts, showing that they are spatially small [Blake et. al., 52 \nThursday, 23 September 2010 \n4 \n1996]. Nakamura et. al. [2000] found that microbursts tend to occur during storm time in the 53 \nlocal dawn sector and are likely to be produced through interactions with electron whistler-mode 54 \nwaves. Microburst production has also been linked to interaction with chorus waves [Lorentzen 55 \net. al., 2001a; O\u2019Brien et. al., 2004; Bortnik and Thorne, 2007], which occur predominantly in 56 \nthe dawn sector. The majority of geomagnetic storms show a sharp increase in microburst 57 \nactivity, tending to occur at lower L during the storm onset, then slowly moving outward during 58 \nthe recovery period [Johnston and Anderson, 2010; Nakamura et. al., 2000]. At this stage it is 59 \nunclear from spacecraft data how large a spatial region is affected when relativistic microbursts 60 \ntake place. However, estimates have shown that relativistic microbursts could totally deplete the 61 \nrelativistic electron population of the outer belt during a geomagnetic storm [Lorentzen et al., 62 \n2001b; O\u2019Brien et. al., 2004]. Further information is required to understand the nature of 63 \nmagnetospheric relativistic electron losses [Thorne et al., 2005], requiring additional (and 64 \npreferably) simultaneous measurements of microburst characteristics.  65 \n As there are many suggestions but little certainty about the behavior of microbursts, methods 66 \nof sensing REP at its lowest penetration altitude would be advantageous. Ionisation levels at the 67 \n40-60 km altitude range can be difficult to probe, with one of the few effective monitoring 68 \ntechniques being the use of long-range Very Low Frequency (VLF) signals. VLF waves 69 \npropagate by reflecting between the Earth\u2019s surface and the lower edge of the ionosphere, 70 \ntravelling in what is effectively an Earth-ionosphere waveguide. The altitude of the lower 71 \nboundary of the ionosphere varies with solar zenith angle and local geomagnetic conditions, 72 \nhaving an approximate value of 70-85 km. Hence, REP tends to penetrate to below the lower 73 \nionospheric boundary, causing a pronounced increase in ionospheric ionization in the region of 74 \nthe precipitation event. Any VLF signal whose propagation path passes through the ionization 75 \nchange region will be perturbed in amplitude and phase, and as a result imprinted with an 76 \nThursday, 23 September 2010 \n5 \nindication of REP activity. Recent studies of subionospheric VLF signals have found 77 \nperturbation signatures of ~1 s to occur during periods of geomagnetic disturbance [Clilverd et. 78 \nal., 2006; Rodger et. al., 2007]. These perturbations have been termed FAST events and are 79 \nthought to be the first documented ground-based detection of REP microbursts. It is 80 \nhypothesized that each FAST event is the signature of one microburst, with a \"rainstorm\" of 81 \nmultiple microburst \u201craindrops\u201d occurring in the area local to the receiver.  82 \n In this paper we make a comparison between the characteristics of FAST events detected by 83 \nsubionospheric VLF and microbursts detected on a satellite, to determine the validity of the 84 \nhypothesis that FAST events are the subionospheric signature of relativistic electron microburst 85 \nprecipitation events. Correlations in space and time will be examined to determine as much as 86 \npossible about the nature of FAST events and to expand upon what is currently known about 87 \nmicrobursts. In particular, the potential size of a single REP microburst, or \u201craindrop\u201d size, is 88 \ninvestigated, as is the size of the region across which microbursts can occur simultaneously, the 89 \n\"rainstorm\" size.  90 \n2.  Instrumentation 91 \n This study combines subionospheric VLF signals and satellite data recorded from December 92 \n2004 \u2013 June 2005. We examine subionospheric VLF data detected at a VLF receiver located at 93 \nthe Sodankyl\u00e4 Geophysical Observatory (SGO), in Finland (67.4\u00baN, 26.4\u00baE, L=5.3). We use 94 \nsignals from transmitters located in Europe and North America, i.e., NDK (46.4\u00ba N, 98.3\u00ba E, 95 \nL=3.3; North Dakota, USA; 25.2 kHz), NAA (44.6\u00ba N, 67.3\u00baE, L=2.9; Maine, USA; 24.0 kHz), 96 \nNRK (64.2\u00ba N, 21.9\u00ba W, L=5.6; Keflavik, Iceland; 37.5 kHz), DHO (53.1\u00ba N, 7.6\u00ba W, L=2.4; 97 \nRamsloh, Germany; 23.4 kHz) and ICV (40.9\u00ba N, 9.8\u00ba W, L=1.5; Tavolara Island, Italy; 98 \n20.27 kHz). The transmitter locations and their signal transmission paths to SGO are shown in 99 \nFigure 1. The SGO VLF receiver is part of the Antarctic-Arctic Radiation-belt Dynamic 100 \nThursday, 23 September 2010 \n6 \nDeposition VLF Atmospheric Research Konsortia (AARDDVARK) network. Further 101 \ninformation about the AARDDVARK network can be found in Clilverd et. al. [2009a], and the 102 \nAARDDVARK website at 103 \nhttp:\/\/www.physics.otago.ac.nz\/space\/AARDDVARK_homepage.htm.  104 \n The Solar Anomalous and Magnetospheric Particle Explorer (SAMPEX) satellite carries the 105 \nHeavy Ion Large Telescope (HILT), which gives high sensitivity and 30 ms time resolution 106 \nmeasurements of the flux of >1.05 MeV electrons [Klecker et. al., 1993]. While the Si-Li 107 \ndetectors are dominated by relativistic electrons during passes through the outer radiation belt, 108 \nthey may also be contaminated by protons during solar proton events. Monte Carlo calculations 109 \npredict that 1 MeV electrons see the HILT as having an effective geometric factor of ~100 cm2sr 110 \n[Blake et al., 1996; Nakamura et al., 1998], a substantial viewing window that is ideal for 111 \nstudying energetic electron precipitation. HILT data with a high-rate sampling period of 20 ms 112 \nwas used in our investigation. The detectors on HILT saturate at a particle flux of 104 electrons 113 \ncm-2s-1sr-1.  114 \n The SAMPEX orbital period is ~96 minutes and the magnetic local time of the satellite repeats 115 \napproximately every 80 days [Blake et al., 1996]. The SAMPEX satellite's low altitude, polar 116 \norbit means that it passes through Earth's radiation belts four times with each orbit, totaling 117 \napproximately 60 passes a day, at ~24 minutes a pass. SAMPEX has an orbital inclination of 118 \n81.7\u00b0 [Nakamura et al., 1998].  119 \n HILT mainly views the Bounce and Drift Loss Cones (BLC and DLC respectively), thus 120 \ndetecting electrons that will precipitate within at least one drift period (i.e., ~15 min at L=4 for a 121 \n1.5 MeV electron).  122 \n3. FAST Events 123 \nThursday, 23 September 2010 \n7 \n Clilverd et al. [2006] presented what is thought to be the first ever ground based detection of 124 \nrelativistic electron microbursts. This study undertook an analysis of subionospheric VLF 125 \nAARDDVARK data during a magnetospheric electron flux decrease that took place at 17:10 UT 126 \non the 21st of January, 2005. Short lived VLF amplitude and phase perturbations observed 127 \nduring the flux decrease were termed FAST events. It has been reported that FAST events are 128 \nconsistent with the expected effects of microbursts of relativistic electrons impacting on the 129 \natmosphere and scattering VLF transmissions, as shown by the modelling in Rodger et al. 130 \n[2007]. Approximately 99% of individual FAST events occurring during the 21 January 2005 131 \nstorm were not coincident across different received signals [Clilverd et al., 2006]. The lack of 132 \nevent coincidence suggests that FAST events are the result of a precipitation \u201crainstorm\u201d 133 \nproducing spatially small (tens of km or less) \u201craindrop\u201d-like ionisation density changes, caused 134 \nby a physical process spanning a much larger region, i.e., many hundreds of kilometres in 135 \ndiameter [Clilverd et al., 2006], centred on or near Sodankyl\u00e4.  136 \n A search for FAST events across the time period December 2004-June 2005 identified four 137 \nadditional periods in SGO AARDDVARK data. As with 21 January 2005, all four additional 138 \nperiods occurred during geomagnetic storms, with two occurring during the local day time. This 139 \nis expected as the relativistic electron precipitation that is thought to cause FAST event 140 \nsignatures should penetrate so deeply into the ionosphere that they would be observable both 141 \nduring the local day and night. The characteristics of all five documented FAST periods are 142 \nlisted in Table 1 and an example of a single FAST event is shown in Figure 2. Included in Table 143 \n1 is the peak >10 MeV proton flux reported by the GOES for each period. No FAST event 144 \nsignatures were observed for KP<6, suggesting that only strong geomagnetic disturbances can 145 \nproduce FAST events. This is consistent with the strong Dst link previously reported between 146 \nstorms and microbursts [O\u2019Brien et. al., 2003].  147 \nThursday, 23 September 2010 \n8 \n The 21 January 2005 FAST events decayed over an average time period of 0.8 s each, while 148 \nthose for 4-5 April 2005 were observed to decay in an average of 1.2 s each. Rodger et al. [2007] 149 \nshowed the latter result is consistent with the modelled ionosphere recovery of ionization 150 \nincreases produced at altitudes as low as 40-60 km due to REP with energies >2 MeV. The 151 \nshorter 21 January 2005 decay time was explained by the upper parts of the REP-produced 152 \nionisation changes being \u201cmasked\u201d by excess ionization because of proton precipitation during a 153 \nsolar proton event. The time decays of the new FAST perturbations were examined, and 154 \ncontrasted with the geophysical conditions at the time. 155 \n In Table 1 the shortest decay times are found for daytime ionospheric conditions when a solar 156 \nproton event was occurring (15 May 2005), while the longest were for nighttime ionospheric 157 \nconditions with essentially no precipitating proton flux (4-5 April 2005). A simple \u201ccartoon 158 \nmodel\u201d would suggest that daytime REP produced ionization would have shorter decay times 159 \nthan that for nighttime REP. Similarly, REP produced ionization occurring during solar proton 160 \nevents would also have shorter decay times than non-SPE periods, due to increased high-altitude 161 \nionization levels perturbing the ionosphere. The FAST event decay times in Table 1 are 162 \nconsistent with the cartoon model of a rainstorm of REP microbursts. 163 \n4. SAMPEX microbursts 164 \n To investigate whether FAST events are caused by relativistic electron microbursts, a survey 165 \nwas undertaken of microbursts detected by the SAMPEX\u2019s HILT instrument during the FAST 166 \nperiods identified. The survey was confined to REP detected while HILT was viewing the 167 \nbounce-loss cone exclusively, as these microbursts represent local precipitation. This was 168 \ndefined by periods for which the mirror altitude of the SAMPEX-reported electron fluxes were 169 \nless than 120 km, indicating that the SAMPEX was only viewing the bounce loss cone.  170 \nThursday, 23 September 2010 \n9 \n In the current study we use the 100 km altitude projection of SAMPEX's geomagnetic field 171 \nline, as this provides the coordinates where any SAMPEX observed REP would precipitate into 172 \nthe atmosphere. As relativistic electron microbursts occur during large geomagnetic storms, 173 \nsome uncertainties might be expected in the field line mapping. We used the 174 \nDefinite\/International Geomagnetic Reference Field (DGRF\/IGRF), employing the GEOPACK 175 \nsoftware routines calculated for April 2005, to trace from the geomagnetic latitude and longitude 176 \nof SAMPEX's location, down the magnetic field line to the top of the atmosphere. The effective 177 \ntop of the atmosphere was taken to be ~100 km, as in the SAMPEX data. To test the effect of a 178 \ngeomagnetic storm upon the 100 km altitude field line position, the KP-dependent Tsyganenko 179 \nmagnetospheric field model was used [Tsyganenko, 1989]. The model was supplied with the 180 \nmaximum KP during the 4-5 April 2005 FAST period (KP=7). This showed that the maximum 181 \ndisplacement was <1 km, thus the field line mapping to the atmosphere is sufficiently accurate 182 \nfor the purpose of this investigation.  183 \n To determine whether a SAMPEX reported flux increase can be identified as a microburst, two 184 \ncriteria were employed as suggested by O\u2019Brien et. al. [2004]. It was required that HILT 185 \nrecorded a flux increase lasting <1 s before decaying back to the level of the background flux, as 186 \nwell as measuring above a specified threshold flux during the increase. We follow O\u2019Brien et. al. 187 \n[2004] and set the threshold flux increase, J, is 10  times the background population, J0, that 188 \nSAMPEX records, i.e.,  189 \n  J \u2265 sqrt(10)\u00d7 J0 = 3.16 J0 190 \nWe also use O'Brien's method of establishing the baseline flux as the 10th percentile of the 191 \nfluxes, while also placing a floor at a flux level of 101 cm-2 str-1 s-1 [O\u2019Brien et. al., 2004]. Any 192 \ndeviations from the J(DLC) level may represent bounce loss cone precipitation.   193 \nThursday, 23 September 2010 \n10 \n  We follow the approach outlined in Rodger et al. [2010] to examine the radiation belt electron 194 \npopulations observed by SAMPEX's HILT instrument. SAMPEX orbital datafiles include the 195 \nIGRF-determined pitch angle at the spacecraft of a particle heading down the instrument 196 \nboresight, which have been processed to produce a world map of median pitch angles with a 1\u00b0 197 \nlatitude\/longitude resolution. Using the IGRF model for an average SAMPEX altitude of 198 \n494 km, we have created a similar world map for the angular width of the bounce and drift loss 199 \ncones at the satellite. When these are combined with the HILT boresight pitch angle width of 200 \n68\u00b0 we can describe the geographical variation of the particle populations detected, taking into 201 \naccount the HILT viewing width.  202 \n  Figure 3 presents a world map of the changing radiation belt population observed by HILT. In 203 \nthis figure \"T\" indicates trapped flux, \"DLC\" is drift-loss cone, and \"FL BLC\" is field line 204 \nbounce loss cone. Note that the FL BLC angle is defined as the largest of the two loss cone 205 \nangles defined for the two hemispheres. Near the geomagnetic equator the instrument only 206 \nmeasures fluxes inside the bounce-loss cone (FL BLC), i.e., precipitating beneath the 207 \nspacecraft, but for most of the globe it observes a mix of DLC and BLC populations [Klecker 208 \net. al., 1993; Nakamura et. al., 2000]. Note that above the SAMA the instrument detects part of 209 \nthe BLC, all of the DLC and a fraction of the trapped population. In contrast, in the Northern 210 \nHemisphere from about 85\u00b0W to 55\u00b0E the HILT detects only BLC fluxes, consistent with 211 \nstatements by Li et al. [1997]. While Figure 3 was made for the satellite mean altitude of 212 \n494 km, very similar plots are produced for the full range of altitudes over which SAMPEX 213 \norbits (~450-530 km).  214 \n A survey of SAMPEX's HILT data found relativistic electron microbursts to occur during each 215 \nof the FAST periods identified in the subionospheric data. These microbursts were sorted by 216 \ntheir northern hemisphere mirror altitude to determine whether they were in the local drift or 217 \nThursday, 23 September 2010 \n11 \nbounce loss cones, with the total number of microbursts detected and the number of those that 218 \nwere detected while viewing the BLC shown in Table 2. There is no simple relationship between 219 \nthe number of SGO FAST events and SAMPEX microbursts occurring on any given day. This is 220 \nalso true when considering KP and the number of microbursts, as is also seen with KP and the 221 \nnumber of FAST events.  222 \n The L-variation in the occurrence number and average flux of SAMPEX detected BLC 223 \nmicrobursts in our data catalogue is shown in Figure 4. The left-hand panel shows the recorded 224 \nnumber of microbursts in each L-value range, which is in agreement with previously published 225 \nresults [Millan and Thorne, Fig. 5(b), 2007]. The right-hand panel shows the L-variation in the 226 \nHILT reported BLC microburst intensities, in terms of the median increase in flux relative to the 227 \nbackground. The dotted line shows the absolute flux increase with units of log10(electrons cm-2s-228 \n1str-1), while the solid line shows the relative flux increase. A typical BLC microburst event 229 \nobserved in this study had a median >1.05 MeV flux of ~400 el. cm-2s-1str-1, and was ten times 230 \nlarger than the background flux. Note that the mean flux increases are considerably larger, due to 231 \nthe very wide distribution of intensities. For example, the relative mean flux increase is 45 times 232 \nabove background for our BLC microburst events. 233 \n5. Microburst Characteristics  234 \n To investigate the link between FAST events and REP microbursts, the BLC microbursts 235 \ncatalogued in this study were compared with the occurrence times of all SGO FAST events in 236 \nour study period. For two events to be considered as coincident in time, the peak perturbations of 237 \nthe events must be separated by less than the average microburst duration, which we found to be 238 \n<0.29 s. The percentage of temporal overlap of the two perturbations is not used as a criterion for 239 \ndetermining coincident occurrence because the rise and fall of a FAST event appears to be 240 \ndetermined by ionospheric conditions and can be partially masked by multiple FAST events 241 \nThursday, 23 September 2010 \n12 \noccurring in a short time period. From a total of 219 BLC microbursts and 829 SGO FAST 242 \nevents, only two microbursts were found to be coincident with a FAST event, leading to a 243 \ncoincidence rate of ~1%.  244 \n Periods of SAMPEX microbursts and SGO FAST events were also compared to look for event 245 \n\u201cpatterns\u201d; to test if there was a time offset in the SAMPEX data set and to see if any groups of 246 \nevents appeared to be coincident in time if the time-axis was moved linearly. This effect was not 247 \nseen. The drift loss cone microbursts catalogued were also tested to search for any one-to-one 248 \ntime correlations with FAST events, but none were found. 249 \n5.1 Microburst size 250 \n To determine the spatial extent of an individual microburst, two point measurements of the 251 \nsame microburst are needed. These two point measurements must be coincident in time and 252 \nwould ideally be separated by \u226410 km, the previous SAMPEX-derived estimate for the 253 \nhorizontal extent of a single REP microburst [Blake et. al., 1996]. If the SAMPEX size estimate 254 \nis correct, two measurements that are coincident in time but separated by a greater distance will 255 \nnot detect the same microburst, but could give some insight into the maximum possible 256 \nmicroburst size. Hence, points coincident in time but separated by a distance of up to 20 km will 257 \nbe considered in this study.  258 \n In order to obtain two spatially close, temporally coincident point measurements for our study, 259 \nSAMPEX must be reporting microbursts while passing over a monitored VLF transmission path, 260 \nduring a period in which FAST events are observed. Of the five FAST periods identified in our 261 \nstudy, only one SAMPEX pass was found to meet these conditions. At ~3 UT on 5 April 2005, 262 \nmicrobursts were detected while SAMPEX was viewing only the BLC on fieldlines which map 263 \nto the atmosphere over the VLF transmitter-receiver path from ICV to SGO, as shown in Figure 264 \n5. The green crosses in Figure 5 are the field line traced positions of the 24 BLC microbursts that 265 \nThursday, 23 September 2010 \n13 \nSAMPEX detected while it travelled north-east, crossing over the VLF transmission path 266 \n(marked in black) and passing near the SGO receiver (marked by a red diamond). Thirteen of 267 \nthese 24 BLC microbursts were detected when SAMPEX was \u226420 km from the ICV path, hence 268 \nthese 13 fall within our criteria for \"closeness\". The two closest BLC microbursts occur at 269 \ndistances of 4.2 km and 4.3 km away from the path from ICV to SGO. However, no FAST 270 \nevents are observed at SGO coincident with these two microbursts, or for any of the other 11 of 271 \nthis set. The SGO observations of transmissions from ICV for this time period are shown in the 272 \nupper panel of Figure 6. Vertical thin lines mark the times of the first ten SAMPEX observed 273 \nBLC microbursts for this time period. Clearly, no coincident FAST events are seen at these 274 \ntimes. To provide context, the lower panel of this Figure presents examples of FAST events on 275 \nthis transmitter signal, which occurred approximately one hour earlier. The ten microbursts 276 \nshown in the upper panel of Figure 6 have a median flux of ~3900 el. cm-2 s-1 str-1, a value ~10 277 \ntimes greater than that found in Section 4. Even though the fluxes of these microbursts greatly 278 \nexceed the typical flux we have identified, no coincident FAST events were seen. One 279 \ninterpretation of the lack of coincidence between BLC microbursts and FAST events in this case 280 \nis that individual microbursts have radii <4 km; this estimate assumes that microbursts are 281 \nroughly circular and each one is approximately the same spatial size. Our estimate is consistent 282 \nwith the Blake et al. [1996] suggestion of a diameter of <10 km, but at this point we have not 283 \nbeen able to \u201ccatch a raindrop\u201d.  284 \n During our analysis we also identified SAMPEX BLC microbursts that occurred on 19 January 285 \n2005, as SAMPEX was passing above western Iceland. The eastern part of Iceland hosts the US 286 \nNavy VLF transmitter NRK, which is monitored at SGO and at the AARDDVARK receiver in 287 \nNy \u00c5lesund, Svalbard (79\u00ba N, 11\u00ba E, L=18.3). While the NRK observations at SGO showed 288 \nFAST events, those from Ny \u00c5lesund did not, with no coincident BLC microbursts and SGO 289 \nThursday, 23 September 2010 \n14 \nFAST events. This strongly suggests that the precipitation needs to occur close to the receiver to 290 \nproduce a detectable FAST event, as otherwise FAST events should have been seen in the data 291 \nfrom both AARDDVARK stations. In this case SAMPEX reported BLC microbursts over 292 \nIceland and FAST events were reported by SGO. Given that these two points are roughly 50\u00b0 in 293 \nlongitude apart, it appears that the size of the rainstorm which produces microbursts may be very 294 \nlarge. We consider this in more detail in the next section.  295 \n5.2 Storm size 296 \n If the storm size, the spatial extent of the magnetospheric process that is causing microbursts, 297 \nis to be determined, a minimum of two point measurements are again needed. Detection of 298 \nmicrobursts occurring at similar times while being spatially separated by >10 km, would help to 299 \ndetermine the minimum size of a \u201cmicroburst storm\u201d. Here we assume that FAST events are 300 \nindeed relativistic electron microbursts, while we acknowledge that so far, we have been unable 301 \nto \u201ccatch a raindrop\u201d. In this way we can attempt to measure the size of the storm driving 302 \nmicroburst production.  303 \n At about 14:20 UT on 8 May 2005 SAMPEX moved into the North Atlantic region in which it 304 \nviews only the BLC. During this period, SGO had been reporting FAST events and, as expected, 305 \nSAMPEX detected a series of relativistic BLC microbursts as it passed from about L=4 to L=6. 306 \nThe SAMPEX events occurred while the satellite was passing over the mouth of the Gulf of 307 \nSaint Lawrence in eastern Canada. The simultaneous observation of REP precipitation at 308 \nSAMPEX's location and SGO suggests either two widely separated storms or one single large 309 \nstorm spanning 94\u00b0 in longitude from the easternmost microburst position to SGO, stretching 310 \nacross 5,061 km and spanning ~6-12 MLT. Further support for the existence of a single storm 311 \nregion comes from precipitation observed on 19 January 2005. During ~1-6 UT SAMPEX 312 \ndetected BLC microbursts over the North East coast of North America and also in the North 313 \nThursday, 23 September 2010 \n15 \nAtlantic. Across this time period SGO also observed FAST event activity. The fieldline traced 314 \nlocations of these microbursts are shown in Figure 7 as green circles, superimposed upon the 315 \norbital track for which SAMPEX is observing only the BLC (smaller blue circles). The position 316 \nof SGO is shown by a red diamond. Here a single storm system of a minimum of ~90\u00b0 in 317 \nlongitude again spanning a minimum of ~6 MLT seems most likely. Note that this is consistent 318 \nwith earlier SAMPEX studies which established that relativistic microbursts are most common 319 \nfrom ~6-12 MLT [Millan and Thorne, Fig. 5(b), 2007], and suggests that such large storm sizes 320 \nmay well be typical. The MLT range and extent in which SAMPEX detects microbrsts is quite 321 \nsimilar to that reported for chorus whistler-mode waves [Meredith et al., 2003], particularly for 322 \noff-equatorial locations where wave-particle interactions with relativistic electrons are possible 323 \n[Bortnik et al., 2007]. 324 \n We are currently unable to test if a storm can be any wider, due to the fixed receiver placement 325 \nat SGO and due to the restricted longitude range in which SAMPEX detects only BLC 326 \nmicrobursts (as shown in Figure 3). In addition, we do not currently have another receiver in the 327 \nAARDDVARK network in the correct longitude and L-range, although a new deployment is 328 \nexpected in western Canada in October 2010 which should allow expanded microburst storm 329 \nviewing.  330 \n6. Discussion 331 \n Earlier work reported that FAST events detected by AARDDVARK subionospheric VLF have 332 \na one-to-one correlation of ~1-2% when observed across multiple VLF signals [Rodger et al., 333 \n2007]. This very low one-to-one correlation appears to support a small scale size of \u22644 km for an 334 \nindividual relativistic electron microburst and also suggests that the precipitation is occurring in 335 \na \u201crainstorm\u201d. There are some uncertainties concerning this interpretation, however. Previous 336 \nstudies have demonstrated how spatially small, highly conductive regions (produced by many 337 \nThursday, 23 September 2010 \n16 \norder of magnitude increases in D-region ionization levels) can produce high-levels of scattering 338 \nof subionospheric VLF transmissions [e.g., Rodger et al., 1999, 2003]. One example of this 339 \nsituation is the VLF perturbations produced by red sprites. In these cases, the ionization change 340 \ncan be located well off the transmitter-receiver great circle path and still lead to a significant 341 \nVLF perturbation [Hardman et al., 1998]. Extreme cases of VLF perturbations caused by 342 \nionization changes occurring \u201cbehind\u201d the receiver have been reported [Dowden et al., 1996]. As 343 \nsuch, one might expect that the spatially small ionization changes produced by relativistic 344 \nelectron microbursts would lead to FAST events irrespective of whether they are very close to 345 \nthe transmitter-receiver great circle path or somewhere close to the receiver. In these cases, wide-346 \nangle scattering would cause a single ionization change located within a few 100 km of the 347 \nreceiver to produce coincident VLF perturbations on multiple transmitter paths. Clearly, 348 \nhowever, this is not observed in our current study. One possible reason for this is that the 349 \nexpected maximum D-region electron density change calculated for a reasonable representation 350 \nof a typical relativistic electron microburst of 100  el. cm-2 s-1 str-1 [Rodger et al., Fig. 5, 2007] is 351 \nan increase of ~20-40 times, while red sprites produce 4-6 order of magnitude electron density 352 \nincreases [e.g., Rodger and Nunn, 1999; Nunn and Rodger, 1999; Armstrong et al., 2000], in 353 \ncomparison with the ambient night-time ionosphere. This suggests that a typical relativistic 354 \nelectron microburst is likely to be too small to lead to significant wide-angle VLF scattering.  355 \n During each 24 minute pass through the outer radiation belt, SAMPEX travels from L=4 to 356 \nL=6, the region where the majority of microbursts occur, in just 1 minute 45 s. In contrast, the 357 \nSGO receiver has a fixed position it can potentially detect FAST events at any time. This shows 358 \nup the challenge in directly comparing ground-based and satellite observations of short lived 359 \nevents occurring only during major geomagnetic storms. However, we can use the results shown 360 \nin Table 2 to estimate an occurrence rate for FAST events and BLC microbursts, and thus 361 \nThursday, 23 September 2010 \n17 \ncompare the two data sets more closely. During the 5 event periods FAST events are typically 362 \nobserved at a rate of ~0.6 min-1, while the BLC microbursts are observed at a typical rate of 363 \n~8 min-1. These estimates suggest that only ~8% of BLC microbursts are observable as FAST 364 \nevents in the subionospheric data. This might suggest that FAST event signatures are generated 365 \nby the ~10% of microbursts which have the largest precipitation flux, although the lack of any 366 \nclear one-to-one linkage makes this suggestion quite speculative. In addition, based on the 367 \noccurrence rates and event duration, one would expect FAST and BLC microbursts to agree in 368 \ntime by chance ~4% of the time. Given that the observed rate of co-incidence between FAST 369 \nevents and BLC microbursts determined earlier in this study was ~1%, it is likely that this 370 \ncoincidence rate is due to chance, rather than direct agreement. Thus it is not clear that we have 371 \nthe simultaneous observation of the same relativistic precipitation bursts from SAMPEX and 372 \nSGO, even though both datasets indicate relativistic precipitation bursts are occurring during a 373 \ngiven time window.  374 \n Although the rate of occurrence of FAST events is low in comparison with BLC microbursts, 375 \nthe SGO data does provide some additional information regarding the time variation of 376 \nrelativistic precipitation, which is difficult to determine from low-Earth orbit satellite data alone. 377 \nFigure 8 is an example of the type of information that ground-based observations of relativistic 378 \nprecipitation detected through FAST events can provide. The plot shows FAST events on the 379 \ntransmitter NDK received at SGO from 17-22 UT on 21 January 2005. Vertical dashed lines 380 \nindicate the times of large solar wind pressure pulses [e.g., Clilverd et al., 2007]. Two periods 381 \nlabeled \"S\" represent the times of SAMPEX observations in the BLC over the L=3-8 range. As 382 \ncan be seen from the plot, FAST events occur following the times of the pressure pulses, with 383 \nonly low levels of occurrence between the two shock events. During this storm period 384 \nSAMPEX\u2019s orbit was such that it was unable to observe most of the time variation in the 385 \nThursday, 23 September 2010 \n18 \nrelativistic microburst activity that was occurring. Clearly, continuous ground-based 386 \nobservations can provide additional insight into the conditions required for microburst 387 \ngeneration. 388 \n There is currently a satellite mission in its planning stages, which aims to determine the spatial 389 \nextent and energy dependence of relativistic and non-relativistic electron microbursts. This 390 \nproject is the Focused Investigations of Relativistic Electron Burst Intensity, Range, and 391 \nDynamics (FIREBIRD) [Moretto, 2009] mission, to be launched in early 2012. A pair of 392 \nsatellites will be launched together, each carrying a solid-state detector with a large geometric 393 \nfactor measuring 30 keV-3 MeV electrons. The two FIREBIRD satellites will gradually drift 394 \napart over the course of the mission, reaching a separation of ~300 km [Moretto, 2009]. The 395 \nFIREBIRD mission will provide a two-point microburst detection system, and as such will be a 396 \nfurther opportunity for two-point measurements of relativistic microbursts, following on from the 397 \nrecent ground based work. Combining the FIREBIRD observations with additional ground-based 398 \nmeasurements may provide additional clarity to the storm size measurements.  399 \n7.  Conclusions and Summary 400 \n We have attempted to show that FAST events detected in subionospheric VLF observations 401 \nare caused by relativistic electron microbursts, through a comparison with SAMPEX detected 402 \nrelativistic electron precipitation occurring during FAST event periods. We have also attempted 403 \nto demonstrate the spatial extent of a single microburst raindrop and the size of an entire 404 \nmicroburst storm.  405 \n By building upon previous research into the nature of FAST events, it appears that FAST 406 \nevents are indeed caused by relativistic electron microburst precipitation. In this study we have 407 \nshown that only strong geomagnetic disturbances can produce FAST events, consistent with the 408 \nThursday, 23 September 2010 \n19 \nstrong Dst link between storms and relativistic microbursts and we have shown that SAMPEX 409 \ndetects relativistic microbursts during the identified FAST event periods. In addition, the 410 \ndependence of observed FAST event perturbation decay times on ionospheric conditions is also 411 \nconsistent with the subionospheric perturbations being caused by short lived bursts of relativistic 412 \nelectron precipitation.  413 \n However, this study suggests that only the strongest (i.e., highest flux) microbursts might 414 \nproduce an observable FAST event, such that there is little direct agreement between individual 415 \nmicrobursts and FAST events. The one-to-one correlation in time between microbursts and 416 \nAARDDVARK FAST events is very low (~1%), and occurs most likely by chance rather than a 417 \ndirect detection. In the one case where SAMPEX flew along a transmitter-receiver path, none of 418 \nthe BLC microbursts reported by SAMPEX corresponded in time to FAST events. One 419 \ninterpretation of this is that the individual microbursts have radii <4 km, which is consistent with 420 \nearlier satellite-based findings. Our study strongly suggests that the magnetospheric process 421 \nwhich generates relativistic microbursts is vastly larger than the individual bursts. Two examples 422 \nare provided where the storm stretches ~90\u00b0 in longitude and ~6 hours in MLT. This is 423 \nparticularly important given that Lorentzen et al. [2001b] used a ~6 MLT estimate of microburst 424 \nstorm size when showing that relativistic electron microbursts could flush out the entire radiation 425 \nbelt relativistic electron population in less than a day. Our findings support this previous work, 426 \nwhich concluded that REP microbursts could be a highly significant loss mechanism for 427 \nrelativistic electrons during geomagnetic storms. 428 \n 429 \nAcknowledgments CJR and MAC would like to thank the International Space Science Institute 430 \n(ISSI) of Bern, Switzerland, for providing the environment in which this paper could be 431 \nThursday, 23 September 2010 \n20 \ncompleted.
