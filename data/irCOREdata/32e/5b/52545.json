Introduction 21\u00a0\n 22\u00a0\nMethane (CH4) is an important atmospheric constituent on account of its potency as a greenhouse 23\u00a0\ngas and its strong influence on the tropospheric oxidizing capacity.  We know from the polar-ice 24\u00a0\nrecord that between the last glacial maximum (LGM; 21 kyr before present (BP)) and the pre-25\u00a0\nindustrial Holocene (PIH; 1 kyr BP) its concentration, [CH4], rose from around 360 ppbv to about 26\u00a0\n700 ppbv [e.g. Loulergue et al., 2008], but how much of this change was source-driven, and how 27\u00a0\nmuch was sink-driven, remains uncertain [see, e.g., Valdes et al., 2005; Kaplan et al., 2006; Fischer 28\u00a0\net al., 2008].  This study focuses on the 12\/13C-isotopic composition of CH4 trapped in polar ice, 29\u00a0\n\uf06413CH4, which provides a complementary constraint on the CH4 budget and past changes therein 30\u00a0\n[see, e.g., Ferretti et al., 2005; Fischer et al., 2008].  In the nomenclature of Schaefer and Whiticar 31\u00a0\n[2008], \uf06413CH4 can be expressed as the sum of the average isotopic composition of CH4 sources, 32\u00a0\n\uf06413CE, and the average influence, by way of isotopic fractionation, of CH4 sinks, \uf065WT (equation 1).  33\u00a0\n\uf06413CE can be broken down into the strength of each source, Ei, and its isotopic composition, 34\u00a0\niE\nC13\uf064 (equation 2).  Similarly, \uf065WT can be broken down into the fraction of CH4 removed by each 35\u00a0\nsink, Fj, and the fractionation coefficient associated with it, \uf061j (equation 3).  Here, we explore the 36\u00a0\ninfluence that CH4-oxidation by atomic chlorine in the marine boundary layer (ClMBL) has on 37\u00a0\n\uf06413CH4 (encapsulated by the term, (\uf061Cl-1).FCl, in equation 3), specifically the contribution that 38\u00a0\nchanges in the strength of this sink could make to glacial-interglacial changes in \uf06413CH4. 39\u00a0\n 40\u00a0\n13 13\n4 E WTCH C\uf064 \uf064 \uf065\uf03d \uf02b   (1) 41\u00a0\n13\n13 1\n1\n.\ni\nn\nE i\ni\nE n\ni\ni\nC E\nC\nE\n\uf064\n\uf064 \uf03d\n\uf03d\n\uf03d\n\uf0e5\n\uf0e5\n  (2) 42\u00a0\n1\n( 1).\nn\nWT j j\nj\nF\uf065 \uf061\n\uf03d\n\uf03d \uf02d\uf0e5   (3) 43\u00a0\n 44\u00a0\nAt present, about 80% of CH4 is removed by the hydroxyl radical (OH) in the troposphere alone 45\u00a0\n[e.g. Levy, 1971; Fung et al., 1991; Lelieveld et al., 1998].  Less than or similar to 10% is removed 46\u00a0\nby soil uptake, and a similar fraction is removed by oxidants in the stratosphere [see, e.g., Fung et 47\u00a0\nal., 1991; Lelieveld et al., 1998; Ridgwell et al., 1999].  It is estimated that ClMBL removes just 3-48\u00a0\n4% of CH4 [e.g. Platt et al., 2004; Allan et al., 2007, 2010], yet owing to the strength of isotopic 49\u00a0\nfractionation associated with this sink (\uf061Cl>1.06 [e.g. Saueressig et al., 1995] c.f. \uf061OH=1.0039 50\u00a0\n[Saueressig et al., 2001] and \uf061soil=1.017-1.025 [e.g., Reeburgh et al., 1997; Snover and Quay, 51\u00a0\n2000]), ClMBL could be responsible for an enrichment in \uf06413CH4 of 2.6\u2030 relative to \uf06413CE [Allan et 52\u00a0\nal., 2007].  Whilst changes in the strength of the ClMBL sink have been invoked to explain spatial 53\u00a0\nand inter-annual variations in \uf06413CH4 [Allan et al., 2005, 2007], their potential to contribute to 54\u00a0\nglacial-interglacial changes has not been explored.  Fischer et al. [2008], for example, did not 55\u00a0\nconsider ClMBL when attempting to explain the 3.5\u2030 enrichment in \uf06413CH4 they measured at the 56\u00a0\nLGM, relative to the pre-boreal Holocene (10 kyr BP).  Schaefer and Whiticar [2008] did include 57\u00a0\nClMBL in their study of the glacial-interglacial \uf06413CH4 record, but did not allow for changes in the 58\u00a0\nstrength of this sink.  Here, we explore how sensitive the strength of the ClMBL sink is to a factor 59\u00a0\nthat could well have changed on glacial-interglacial timescales: the horizontal wind speed at the sea 60\u00a0\nsurface. 61\u00a0\n 62\u00a0\nThe main source of ClMBL is sea salt aerosol (SSA), which is produced by the action of the wind on 63\u00a0\nwave crests, and from which BrCl and Cl2 (that photolyse to give ClMBL) are liberated [see, e.g., 64\u00a0\nVogt et al., 1996; Platt et al., 2004].  The abundance of SSA in pseudo steady-state is determined by 65\u00a0\nthe rate of SSA production and the rate of SSA removal (e.g. by wet and dry deposition).  The 66\u00a0\nabundance of ClMBL derived from SSA then depends on the abundance of SSA, the acidity of the 67\u00a0\natmosphere, as BrCl and Cl2 are believed to be liberated from SSA that has been acidified by the 68\u00a0\nproducts of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) oxidation [Vogt et al., 1996; Platt et al., 2004], and the 69\u00a0\nintensity of radiation of the wavelengths required to photolyse BrCl and Cl2.  However, as a first 70\u00a0\nstep in exploring the potential for ClMBL to contribute to glacial-interglacial changes in \uf06413CH4, we 71\u00a0\nexplore the influence of the circulation alone, on the grounds that the production of SSA is highly 72\u00a0\nsensitive to the wind speed [see, e.g., Monahan et al., 1986; Andreas et al., 1998; Witek et al., 73\u00a0\n2007], and several lines of paleodata, including the ice-core records of dust and sea salt [e.g. 74\u00a0\nThompson and Mosley-Thompson, 1981; Petit et al., 1981; Hansson, 1994; Rothlisberger et al., 75\u00a0\n2002; and the recent review by Fischer et al., 2007], could indicate changes in this at the LGM. 76\u00a0\n 77\u00a0\nWe do so via a number of simple calculations employing a variety of model simulations of the PIH 78\u00a0\nand LGM circulations.  It is important we explore a variety of simulations, as there has been little 79\u00a0\nconsensus regarding the changes at the LGM, particularly in the region of the southern hemisphere 80\u00a0\nwesterlies (SHW), with estimates ranging from a 40% reduction in surface wind speeds [Kim et al., 81\u00a0\n2003] to a 25% increase in surface wind stress (implying a 12% increase in wind speeds) [Shin et 82\u00a0\nal, 2003] in this region.  Much of the literature has focused on changes in the strength (and position) 83\u00a0\nof the SHW, owing to the bearing these could have on glacial-interglacial changes in CO2 [see, e.g., 84\u00a0\nToggweiler, 1999; Toggweiler and Russell, 2008].  As the SHW exhibit some of the highest surface 85\u00a0\nwind speeds globally and cover a broad swath of the Southern Ocean (see Figure 1), changes in 86\u00a0\ntheir strength could also have bearing on the global strength of the ClMBL sink, and hence \uf06413CH4.  87\u00a0\nBy employing a variety of simulations, we probe the range of influences circulation-driven changes 88\u00a0\nin the strength of this sink could have had on \uf06413CH4.  89\u00a0\n 90\u00a0\n 91\u00a0\n2. Calculations 92\u00a0\n 93\u00a0\nWe start by assuming that ClMBL removed the same fraction of CH4 in the PIH as it is estimated to 94\u00a0\nremove in the present, and hence was responsible for an equal enrichment in \uf06413CH4 (relative to 95\u00a0\n\uf06413CE), namely 2.6(\u00b11.2)\u2030 [Allan et al., 2007].  We thus equate (\uf061Cl-1).FCl, integrated seasonally 96\u00a0\nand globally in the PIH, to 2.6\u2030; see equation 3 and accompanying text.  FCl is estimated to be 97\u00a0\nbetween 0.03 and 0.04 [Platt et al., 2004; Allan et al., 2007, 2010], hence FCl is small compared to 98\u00a0\n1-FCl (the fraction of CH4 removed by all other sinks) and a modest change in FCl, of up to say 99\u00a0\n\u00b150%, will have little effect on FOH, Fsoil etc.  It follows that, to a good degree of approximation, an 100\u00a0\nX% increase (decrease) in (\uf061Cl-1).FCl will be accompanied by a 0.026X\u2030 enrichment (depletion) in 101\u00a0\n\uf06413CH4.  Assuming the rate of CH4 removal by each CH4 sink is first order with respect to [CH4], 102\u00a0\nand again as FCl is small compared to 1-FCl, we assume FCl is proportional to the product of [ClMBL] 103\u00a0\nand the rate coefficient for the reaction between ClMBL and CH4, kCl.  Accordingly, an X% increase 104\u00a0\n(decrease) in (\uf061Cl-1).kCl[ClMBL] will be accompanied by a 0.026X\u2030 enrichment (depletion) in 105\u00a0\n\uf06413CH4.  We can calculate \uf061Cl according to equation 4 [Saueressig et al., 1995], and kCl (molecules-1 106\u00a0\ncm3 s-1) according to equation 5 [Sander et al., 2003], where T is the temperature (K). 107\u00a0\n 108\u00a0\n6.455\n1.043 TCl e\uf061 \uf03d \uf0b4   (4) 109\u00a0\n1360\n129.6 10 . TClk e\n\uf02d\n\uf02d\uf03d \uf0b4   (5) 110\u00a0\n 111\u00a0\nTo calculate [ClMBL] (molecules cm-3), we use a modified version (our equation 7) of the simple 112\u00a0\nformulation with which Allan et al. [2007] explored the role of ClMBL in spatial and inter-annual 113\u00a0\nvariations in \uf06413CH4 (our equation 6).  Equation 6 expresses [ClMBL] in terms of an average 114\u00a0\nconcentration of 18x103 molecules cm-3 and a seasonal variation governed by the time of year, t 115\u00a0\n(day number).  The tanh(3\uf06c) term, where \uf06c is the latitude (radians), simply ensures the seasonal 116\u00a0\ncycles in the northern and southern hemispheres are six months out of phase.  To explore the 117\u00a0\ninfluence that the wind has on [ClMBL], we add a factor of N.VP, where V is the horizontal wind 118\u00a0\nspeed (ms-1), P is the power to which this is raised and N is a normalization factor, of which our 119\u00a0\nresults are independent as we are only interested in percentage changes in [ClMBL].  We do so on the 120\u00a0\nbasis that Gong et al. [2002] suggest the column loading of SSA is proportional to VP (with P=1.39 121\u00a0\nin the North Atlantic, 1.46 in the tropical Pacific, and 1.66 in the South Pacific).  Assuming (1) the 122\u00a0\ncolumn loading of ClMBL is proportional to that of SSA, (2) the ClMBL is concentrated in the marine 123\u00a0\nboundary layer (MBL), and (3) the height of the MBL does not change, [ClMBL] should also be 124\u00a0\nproportional to VP.  Though Gong et al. [2002] did not comment on it, their plots of loading versus 125\u00a0\nwind speed [their Figure 2] indicate a proportionality to V3.41, or similar, at wind speeds above 126\u00a0\nabout 5ms-1.  We therefore employ (globally) P=1.39 at V\u22645ms-1 and 3.41 at V>5ms-1, but also 127\u00a0\nexplore the sensitivity of our results to variations in this formulation (see later). 128\u00a0\n 129\u00a0\n\uf05b \uf05d \uf05b \uf05d\uf07b \uf07d365\/)90(2sin)3tanh(1.1018 3 \uf02d\uf02b\uf0b4\uf03d tClMBL \uf070\uf06c   (6) 130\u00a0\n 131\u00a0\n\uf05b \uf05d \uf05b \uf05d\uf07b \uf07d PMBL VNtCl ..365\/)90(2sin)3tanh(1.1018 3 \uf02d\uf02b\uf0b4\uf03d \uf070\uf06c  (7) 132\u00a0\n  133\u00a0\nWith equations 4, 5 and 7, we can calculate (\uf061Cl-1).kCl[ClMBL] as a function of season and location 134\u00a0\nduring the PIH and LGM, provided we have the necessary wind and temperature data.  Summarized 135\u00a0\nin Table 1, these are taken from simulations with five general circulation models, more information 136\u00a0\non which can be found in our Auxiliary Material.  Figure 1 illustrates the annual-mean surface wind 137\u00a0\nspeeds and temperatures in the PIH, and the changes in these at the LGM, according to each model.  138\u00a0\nIt also illustrates the percentage changes we calculate in [ClMBL] at the LGM based on the wind 139\u00a0\ndata.  Subject to the data from each model, we calculate the seasonally and globally integrated value 140\u00a0\nof (\uf061Cl-1).kCl[ClMBL] throughout the MBL (treating areas of sea ice and open ocean alike; discussed 141\u00a0\nlater) in both the PIH and LGM, and hence the percentage change in this quantity on switching from 142\u00a0\nPIH to LGM winds and temperatures, which we relate to a per-mil change in \uf06413CH4. 143\u00a0\n 144\u00a0\nWe use mainly climatological monthly-mean data (based on 100-year integrations, or 20-year 145\u00a0\nintegrations in the case of HadAM3), these being arguably the most robust.  However, we also 146\u00a0\nrepeat our calculations with CCSM3 and HadAM3 data, employing a full 100 years of monthly-147\u00a0\nmean data and a full 20 years of daily-mean data, respectively, to explore the sensitivity of our 148\u00a0\nresults to the degree of temporal averaging; see Table 1.  To assess the sensitivity of our results to 149\u00a0\nour formulation for P, we repeat all of these \u2018base\u2019 calculations (B) subject to an alternative value of 150\u00a0\nP at V\u22645ms-1 (1.66; S1) and alternative values of V at which we switch from P=1.39 to P=3.41 151\u00a0\n(4ms-1 in S2 and 6ms-1 in S3).  We also assess the sensitivity of our results to: the seasonality of 152\u00a0\n[ClMBL], by repeating the base calculations with the tanh(3\uf06c)sin[2\uf070(t-90)\/365] term in equation 7 set 153\u00a0\nto zero (S4); and the changes in temperature between the PIH and LGM, by changing the winds 154\u00a0\nwhilst keeping the temperatures (PIH) constant (S5). 155\u00a0\n 156\u00a0\n 157\u00a0\n3. Results 158\u00a0\n 159\u00a0\nThe results of the base (B) and sensitivity (S1-5) calculations are given in Table 2; the numbers in 160\u00a0\nparentheses correspond to the results obtained when less \u2018temporally averaged\u2019 data are employed 161\u00a0\n(see Table 1 and accompanying text).  We find that the effect on \uf06413CH4 of switching from PIH to 162\u00a0\nLGM winds and temperatures depends on which model data we use and the degree to which these 163\u00a0\nare temporally averaged, with the base calculations yielding everything from a depletion of 0.46\u2030 164\u00a0\nto an enrichment of 0.14\u2030. 165\u00a0\n 166\u00a0\nThe S1 calculations show that our base results are insensitive to the value of P employed at V\u22645ms-167\u00a0\n1; we get the same results regardless of whether we employ the lowest value (1.39) or the highest 168\u00a0\nvalue (1.66) Gong et al. [2002] reported based on calculations in the North Pacific and South 169\u00a0\nPacific respectively.  Furthermore, the S2 and S3 calculations show that our results are reasonably 170\u00a0\nrobust to changes in the value of V at which we switch from P=1.39 to P=3.41, changing by less 171\u00a0\nthan or similar to 10% upon increasing or decreasing this by 1ms-1. 172\u00a0\n 173\u00a0\nThe effect of  removing the [ClMBL] seasonality in the S4 calculations is variable, depending on the 174\u00a0\nmodel data used and the degree to which these are temporally averaged.  Mostly, it has a modest 175\u00a0\neffect (of the order of 10%), however it has a more pronounced effect in the calculations with IPSL-176\u00a0\nCM4 and HadAM3 climatological monthly-mean data.  The change in \uf06413CH4 we calculate could 177\u00a0\ntherefore be sensitive to the assumed [ClMBL] seasonality; we have employed the same [ClMBL] 178\u00a0\nseasonality as Allan et al. [2007], reflecting that of the radiation required to photolyse BrCl and Cl2; 179\u00a0\nsee equation 7 and accompanying text. 180\u00a0\n 181\u00a0\nFinally, based on the S5 calculations, it would appear that the changes in temperature between the 182\u00a0\nPIH and LGM are responsible for a depletion in \uf06413CH4 of approximately 0.05-0.1\u2030, depending on 183\u00a0\nthe model data employed.  The depletion reflects a reduction in the rate of reaction between ClMBL 184\u00a0\nand CH4 due to the reduction in temperatures at the LGM (see Figure 1 and equation 5), only 185\u00a0\nmarginally offset by an increase in the fractionation coefficient associated with this reaction (see 186\u00a0\nequation 4). 187\u00a0\n 188\u00a0\n 189\u00a0\n4. Discussion 190\u00a0\n 191\u00a0\nOur calculations suggest circulation-driven changes in the strength of the ClMBL sink could have a 192\u00a0\nsmall but significant effect on \uf06413CH4 on glacial-interglacial timescales.  Depending on the model 193\u00a0\ndata employed, and the degree to which these are temporally averaged, we calculate changes in 194\u00a0\n\uf06413CH4 ranging from a depletion of 0.46\u2030 to an enrichment of 0.14\u2030, the magnitudes of which are 195\u00a0\nof the order of 10% of the 3.5\u2030 glacial-interglacial difference observed [Fischer et al., 2008].  196\u00a0\nFactors not explored here, which could have also affected [ClMBL] and hence \uf06413CH4 on these 197\u00a0\ntimescales, include: changes in the lifetime of SSA (e.g. due to changes in precipitation); changes in 198\u00a0\nthe acidity of the atmosphere (e.g. due to changes in DMS production linked to changes in biology, 199\u00a0\nsuch as plankton type and\/or abundance); and changes in the intensity of radiation required to 200\u00a0\nphotolyse BrCl and Cl2 (e.g. due to changes in stratospheric ozone).  \uf06413CH4 could have also been 201\u00a0\naffected by changes in FCl (and Fsoil) accompanying changes in FOH, also not explored here.  If 202\u00a0\nFOH=0.9, Fsoil=0.06 and FCl=0.04, and \uf061OH=1.0039\u2030, \uf061soil=1.02\u2030 and \uf061Cl=1.06\u2030, a 5% increase 203\u00a0\n(decrease) in FOH would lead to a 1.4\u2030 depletion (enrichment) in \uf06413CH4 (assuming the change in 204\u00a0\nFOH is compensated for by changes in Fsoil and FCl, and FCl=\u2154 Fsoil). 205\u00a0\n 206\u00a0\nIt is interesting that all of our calculations based on climatological monthly-mean data\u2015arguably 207\u00a0\nthe most robust\u2015suggest that the circulation-driven changes in the ClMBL sink would have led to a 208\u00a0\ndepletion in \uf06413CH4 at the LGM relative to the PIH, primarily due to a reduction in the global 209\u00a0\nabundance of ClMBL.  Ice-core records show an increase in sea salt at the LGM, by a factor of 15 in 210\u00a0\nthe Arctic and 3 in the Antarctic [see Fischer et al., 2007, and references contained therein], which 211\u00a0\nwe would expect to have been accompanied by proportional increases in [ClMBL].  Of course, there 212\u00a0\ncould have been more ClMBL in polar regions but less at lower latitudes, yielding an overall 213\u00a0\nreduction.  However, our calculations yield percentage increases in [ClMBL] in some regions of the 214\u00a0\nArctic Ocean approaching, but still short of, the 15-fold increase we would expect, and generally 215\u00a0\ncapture less of the 3-fold increase expected in the Southern Ocean; see Figure 1.  The calculations 216\u00a0\nbased on CCSM3 and HadAM3 data yield increases limited to the regions south of about 50\u00b0S and 217\u00a0\n60\u00b0S, respectively, accompanied by decreases to the north of these, whilst the remainder of the 218\u00a0\ncalculations predominantly show decreases in the Southern Ocean.  This raises the question, what 219\u00a0\nSSA source are we missing or underestimating in our calculations, and what influence does it have 220\u00a0\non \uf06413CH4?  221\u00a0\n 222\u00a0\nOne possibility is that the simulations of the LGM circulation simply underestimate the wind speeds 223\u00a0\nat high latitudes.  If this were the case, it could call into question the validity of these simulations in 224\u00a0\nother regions too.  It certainly seems likely that at least part of the glacial-interglacial difference in 225\u00a0\nsea salt (and dust) was the result of changes in wind speeds governing the strength of sea-salt 226\u00a0\nsources, changes in wind patterns determining the efficiency of transport to Arctic and Antarctic 227\u00a0\nice-core sites and\/or changes in precipitation affecting its atmospheric lifetime [see, e.g., Fischer et 228\u00a0\nal., 2007; Petit et al., 2009].  However, there is some evidence that sea ice, as opposed to open 229\u00a0\nocean, is the dominant source of SSA reaching both coastal and continental Antarctic sites [e.g. 230\u00a0\nWagenbach et al., 1998; Rankin et al., 2002; Wolff et al., 2003, 2006].  In our calculations, we have 231\u00a0\nassumed that sea ice is an equally strong source, showing the same dependence on wind speed.  If 232\u00a0\nhowever, sea ice were a stronger source on a per-unit-area basis, the increase in sea-ice at the LGM 233\u00a0\ncould have contributed to the 3-fold increase in sea salt seen in the Antarctic, and perhaps the 15-234\u00a0\nfold increase seen in the Arctic.  A sea-ice driven increase in SSA, and hence ClMBL, at high 235\u00a0\nlatitudes would tend to strengthen the ClMBL sink, and hence enrich \uf06413CH4 at the LGM.  However, 236\u00a0\nwithout knowing quantitatively how the strengths of the sea-ice and open-ocean sources compare, 237\u00a0\nwe cannot say what the net effect on \uf06413CH4 would be if the increase in sea-ice were factored into 238\u00a0\nour calculations. 239\u00a0\n 240\u00a0\nWhat we can say is, irrespective of whether the net effect amounts to an enrichment or a depletion 241\u00a0\nin \uf06413CH4, a change in \uf06413CH4 due to a change in the strength of the ClMBL sink would have 242\u00a0\nimplications for our interpretation of the glacial-interglacial \uf06413CH4 record, and we have shown that 243\u00a0\n\uf06413CH4 is affected non-negligibly by circulation-driven changes alone.  Fischer et al. [2008] 244\u00a0\nattributed the enrichment in \uf06413CH4 at the LGM to a near-complete shutdown of boreal wetland 245\u00a0\nsources of relatively 13C-poor CH4, whilst biomass-burning sources of relatively 13C-rich CH4 were 246\u00a0\nlittle or unchanged relative to the pre-boreal Holocene (10 kyr BP).  A global synthesis of charcoal 247\u00a0\nrecords by Power et al. [2008], however, has since shown that the last glacial period (16-21 kyr BP) 248\u00a0\nwas the period of least biomass burning in the last 21 kyr, suggesting we still have some enrichment 249\u00a0\nin \uf06413CH4 at the LGM to explain.  An enrichment due to a strengthening of the ClMBL sink could 250\u00a0\npotentially contribute to this, whilst a depletion due to a weakening of the ClMBL sink would further 251\u00a0\nsuggest the explanation offered by Fischer et al. [2007] is incomplete.  Based on the results to our 252\u00a0\ncalculations, the influence that ClMBL has on \uf06413CH4 cannot be ignored in future interpretations of 253\u00a0\nthe glacial-interglacial \uf06413CH4 record, and hence further research is needed to quantify past changes 254\u00a0\nin the strength of this sink, including those relating to changes in the sea-ice source of SSA. 255\u00a0\n 256\u00a0\n 257\u00a0\nAcknowledgements 258\u00a0\n 259\u00a0\nThis work has been carried out as part of the British Antarctic Survey Polar Science for Planet Earth 260\u00a0\nprogramme.
