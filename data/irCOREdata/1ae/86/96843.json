During segmenta-\ntion, the body axis is divided along the anterior-poste-\nrior (AP) axis into similar repetitive structures formed\nfrom the embryonic layers. In insects, such as Drosoph-\nila melanogaster, segments are generated by the simul-\ntaneous division of the syncitial blastoderm. In other\ninvertebrates, such as annelids and crustaceans, and\nin vertebrates the mechanism of metamerisation is\ndifferent; the segments are formed at the cranial end of\na multicellular embryo and segmentation propagates\ncaudally (for a review, see Weisblat et al., 1994).\nIn vertebrates and cephalochordates, the segments\nare known as somites. They form as paired epithelial\nspheres arranged bilaterally along the AP axis and\nemerge in strict craniocaudal order (for a review, see\nGossler and Hrabe\u02c7 de Angelis, 1998). The generation of\nsomites occurs by the successive segmentation, caudal\nto the most recently formed somite, of the presomitic or\nparaxial mesoderm. Simultaneously, new cells are in-\ncorporated into the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) from\nthe regression of Hensen\u2019s node at the same rate as\nnew somites are formed rostral to the PSM (for a sur-\nvey in the subject, see Catala et al., 1995; Psychoyos\nand Stern, 1996). Somites are divided by a fissure into\nanterior and posterior halves that differ in their gene\nexpression and differentiation (for a review, see Tam\nand Trainor, 1994; Gossler and Hrabe\u02c7 de Angelis,\n1998).\nThe formation and differentiation of somites is the\nresult of three distinct morphological events progress-\ning in a strict temporal-spatial order: (1) the prepat-\nterning of the PSM, (2) somite and somitic boundary\nformation, and (3) the differentiation of a somite into\nanterior and posterior halves (Gossler and Hrabe\u02c7 de\nAngelis, 1998). Several experimental observations con-\nfirm these events. Scanning electron microscopy obser-\nvations (for a review, see Jacobson and Meier, 1986)\nand transplantation experiments (for a review, see\nKeynes and Stern, 1988) show that PSM displays a\nprepattern before segmentation. Recent molecular\nstudies have shown that the basic helix-loop-helix\n(bHLH) transcription factors, her-1 and c-hairy-1, are\nexpressed rhythmically and dynamically in the PSM of\nzebrafish and chick (Mu\u00a8ller et al., 1996; Palmeirim et\nal., 1997). In addition, Notch-Delta pathway genes are\ninvolved in the second and third processes of somite\nformation and differentiation (for a survey, see del\nBarco Barrantes et al., 1999). These molecular results\nsuggest the existence of a conserved mechanism for\nsegmentation in protostomes and deuterostomes\n(McGrew and Pourquie\u00b4, 1998).\nDespite these experimental results, the mechanism\nfor somitogenesis is still one of the major unsolved\nproblems in developmental biology. A number of theo-\nretical models have been proposed to explain somito-\ngenesis. These include the clock and wavefront model\n(Cooke and Zeeman, 1976), the wave gradient model\n(Flint et al., 1978), the reaction-diffusion type model\n(Meinhardt, 1982, 1986), the cell-cycle model (Prim-\nmett et al., 1988, 1989; Stern et al., 1988), and the\nwave-cell polarisation model (Polezhaev, 1992, 1995a,\n1995b). These models are satisfactory in a number of\naspects, but objections have been made to all of them.\nFurthermore, such models cannot explain the dynamic\nexpression of the bHLH transcription factors her-1 and\nc-hairy-1 and some elements of the Notch-Delta\npathway.\nIn the present article we have developed a new the-\noretical model for somitogenesis. After an exposition of\nthe up-to-date experimental facts about somitogenesis,\nwe present previous theoretical models, our new model,\nand a discussion that follows.\n*Correspondence to: Santiago Schnell, Centre for Mathematical\nBiology, Mathematical Institute, 24\u201329 St Giles\u2019, Oxford OX1 3LB,\nUnited Kingdom.

Scan-\nning electron microscopy observations indicate that the\nPSM is not a homogeneous tissue. Before segmenta-\ntion, the PSM displays metameric arrangements of\ngroups of cells, named somitomeres by Meier (1979),\nthat are evidently the predecessors of somites (Jacob-\nson and Meier, 1986; Gossler and Hrabe\u02c7 de Angelis,\n1998). The observation of this prepattern is confirmed\nin microsurgical experiments (Packard and Jacobson,\n1976; Chernoff and Hilfer, 1982) in which isolated\nparts of the PSM form somites some time after their\nisolation in strict craniocaudal order, differentiating\ninto anterior and posterior halves in each somite. Fur-\nthermore, the prepattern of anterior and posterior\nhalves is also established before the formation of the\nsomites (Keynes and Stern, 1988). Transplantation ex-\nperiments reversing the AP axis of the PSM demon-\nstrate that the AP polarity of the resulting pattern of\nsomites is also reversed, so somite halves developed\naccording to their original orientation (Aoyama and\nAsamoto, 1988).\nThe total number of somites is regulated in an em-\nbryo. The Amputated mouse mutant, which is shorter\nthan the wild-type mouse, has the same number of\nsomites, but their somites are considerably smaller\nthan those of the wild-type embryos (Flint et al., 1978).\nHowever, the number of somites can be altered with an\nexperimental perturbation (Keynes and Stern, 1988).\nFor example, heat shock applied to chick embryos can\ninduce the formation of an extra somite (Veini and\nBellairs, 1986; Primmett et al., 1988).\nOther interesting results have been obtained\nthrough heat shock experiments. When a single heat\nshock was applied to chick embryos (Primmett et al.,\n1988), up to four repeated somite anomalies, confined\nto one or two segments, appear separated by relatively\nconstant distances of six to seven normal somites. The\nrepeated anomalies suggest that heat shock affects an\noscillatory process within the somite precursors (Stern\net al., 1988).\nRecently, the study of the expression of the tran-\nscriptional factor c-hairy-1 in the PSM of chick em-\nbryos has provided molecular evidence for the exis-\ntence of a segmentation clock (Palmeirim et al., 1997;\nCooke, 1998). During segmentation, the cells of the\nPSM go through 12 cycles of c-hairy-1 expression before\nbecoming part of a somite, while more cells are contin-\nuously incorporated into the posterior end of the PSM.\nThis observation suggests that the segmentation clock\ncontrols the time duration of cells in the PSM before\nthey will form part of a somite. The expression of c-\nhairy-1 displays a very particular AP pattern, which\nprogressively sweeps along the PSM in an AP sequence\nwhile narrowing, once during each somite formation.\nThis wavefront-like expression finally stops, and it is\nmaintained in a half somite-sized domain that gives\nrise to the caudal half of the forming somite. The c-\nhairy-1 expression is independent of cell movements\nand does not result from the propagation of a signal in\nthe plane of the PSM; it is an intrinsic cell autonomous\nproperty of this tissue (McGrew and Pourquie\u00b4, 1998;\nPourquie\u00b4, 1998).\nPrevious Models\nDuring the last three decades, several models have\nbeen proposed to explain the formation of somites\n(Cooke and Zeeman, 1976; Flint et al., 1978; Bellairs,\n1980, 1986; Meinhardt, 1982, 1986; Jacobson and\nMeier, 1986; Keynes and Stern, 1988; Primmett et al.,\n1989; Polezhaev, 1992, 1995a, 1995b). Some of these\nincorporate the different aspects of somitogenesis pre-\nviously mentioned and are satisfactory in many re-\nspects.\nAmong these models, Cooke and Zeeman (1976) were\nthe first to propose a cellular oscillator, which interacts\nwith a progressing wave of cell determination travel-\nling along the AP axis of the PSM. This model, known\nas the clock and wavefront, is able to explain the con-\ntrol of somite number (Slack, 1991) but is in conflict\nwith the results of microsurgical experiments (Packard\nand Jacobson, 1976), transplantation experiments re-\nversing the AP polarity (Aoyama and Asamoto, 1988),\nand repetitive anomalies of the single heat shock ex-\nperiments (Primmett et al., 1988, 1989; Stern et al.,\n1988). In addition, it cannot explain the formation of\nthe anterior and posterior halves of a somite.\nMeinhardt (1982, 1986) proposed a reaction diffusion\ntype model involving two autocatalytic substances that\nbehave in a short-range activation, long-range inhibi-\ntion manner. It is assumed that cells are distributed in\na uniform density and that the chemicals in the reac-\ntion diffusion model generate a spatial pattern result-\ning in a spatially homogeneous region of cells oscillat-\ning between two states corresponding to the anterior\nand posterior halves of a somite. Meinhardt\u2019s model is\nin agreement with two observations of Palmeirim et al.\n(1997): one full cycle of c-hairy-1 oscillation corre-\nsponds to the formation of one somite, and c-hairy-1\nexpression seems to be reminiscent of the spatiotempo-\nral dynamics of one of the autocatalytic substances,\nbecause its wavefront expression stops and is main-\ntained in the posterior half of the somites. However,\nthe model cannot explain the isolation and transplan-\ntation experiments, the heat shock effects, and seems\nto be contradicted by the cell autonomous nature of the\nc-hairy-1 oscillations and its peculiar dynamics\n(Palmeirim et al., 1997; McGrew and Pourquie\u00b4, 1998;\nPourquie\u00b4, 1998).\nThe cell cycle model (Keynes and Stern, 1988; Stern\net al., 1988; Primmett et al., 1989) relies on an intra-\ncellular oscillator that controls cell division and inter-\n416 SCHNELL AND MAINI\nacts with a kinematic wave that produces a signal that\nrecruits other cells in the vicinity shortly before seg-\nmentation. This model explains the periodic anomalies\nof the heat shock experiments and the isolation and\ntransplantation experiments. However, it cannot ex-\nplain oscillations of c-hairy-1 and its pattern in the\nPSM.\nPolezhaev (1992,1995a,1995b) proposed a wave of\ncell determination moving along the PSM. This wave\ncauses cell differentiation in a particular phase of the\ncell cycle, which then results in these cells secreting an\ninhibitor that impedes the differentiation of other cells.\nThe model explains the heat shock, the isolation, and\ntransplantation experiments but cannot explain the\npattern of the c-hairy-1 waves, its cell autonomous\ncharacter, and the formation of the anterior and pos-\nterior halves.\nClock and Induction Model\nAfter decades of experimental and theoretical work,\nsomitogenesis is still one of the major unsolved prob-\nlems in developmental biology. In the previous section,\nwe reviewed several models proposed to explain the\nformation and regulation of somites. Because somito-\ngenesis is a complex process, the models proposed have\nbeen aimed at addressing specific experimental obser-\nvations. However, objections have been made to all of\nthem, and at present, no model is consistent with all\nexperimental data.\nThe Cooke and Zeeman (1976) model prompted the\nspeculation that somitogenesis might be controlled by a\nclock in the cells of PSM. We know now, from the\nresults of Palmeirim et al. (1997), that PSM cells, in\nfact, produce synchronised oscillations of a bHLH tran-\nscription factor c-hairy-1, a homologue of one of the\nDrosophila pair-rule segmentation genes (McGrew and\nPourquie\u00b4, 1998). The time taken for one oscillation\nequals the time of formation of one somite, and each\ncell experiences the same number of oscillations before\nbecoming a somite. At that point, the expression of\nc-hairy-1 stabilises, cells in the posterior half of the\nnewly formed somite continue expressing this factor,\nwhereas those in the anterior half no longer do so. The\ncrucial role of the oscillations is evident, but how are\nthe oscillations stabilised? Does the expression cycle\ngradually slow down as the cell progresses along the\nsegmental plate? Is there a connection between\nc-hairy-1 expression and differentiation into a poste-\nrior half?\nOver the past few years, genetic studies support the\nview that a periodic biochemical pattern controls the\nphysical pattern in somitogenesis. In particular, the\nrole of the Notch-Delta signalling pathway in somito-\ngenesis has been demonstrated in experiments involv-\ning mice mutants: the somites, if they form at all, are\nirregular in size and shape, no longer symmetrical, and\ntheir AP polarity is also affected (Conlon et al., 1995;\nOka et al., 1995; Habre\u02c7 de Angelis et al., 1997; Wong et\nal., 1997; Evrard et al., 1998; Kusumi et al., 1998;\nZhang and Gridley, 1998). Furthermore, the expression\nof some components of the Notch-Delta pathway in the\nPSM suggests that the segmentation clock could con-\ntrol somitogenesis by modulating their signalling dur-\ning segmentation.\nRecent studies by McGrew et al. (1998) and Forsberg\net al. (1998) have shown that lunatic fringe (l-fng) gene\nexpression resembles the expression of c-hairy-1 in\nPSM. In fact, they show that both expressions are\ncoincident and are responding to the same segmenta-\ntion clock. Experiments blocking protein synthesis in\nthe PSM block the progression of the l-fng wavefront\nbut not that of c-hairy-1. These experiments suggest\nthat both genes are downstream of the segmentation\nclock but that l-fng only requires protein synthesis for\nits expression.\nIn Drosophila, Fringe is a secreted protein that acts\nto potentiate Notch activation by Delta and to inhibit\nNotch activation by the alternative ligand Serrate (Pa-\nnin et al., 1997; Yuan et al., 1997) controlling the\nformation of the wing margin. In l-fng mutant mice, the\nformation of somites is disrupted, and if a somite\nforms, its AP patterning is disturbed (Evrard et al.,\n1998; Zhang and Gridley, 1998). Therefore, l-fng seems\nto be the Notch-Delta component coupled to the seg-\nmentation clock. However, other components could also\nbe involved. The key questions here are how are the\nsegmentation clock and Notch-Delta pathway linked?\nHow are the oscillations stabilised in the PSM?\nWe propose that as a group of cells destined to form\na somite traverse the PSM, they will undergo a series\nof l-fng expression pulses, followed by a longer final\npulse that will remain at the posterior half of the newly\nforming somite. If we assume that l-fng expression in\nPSM synthesises a l-fng protein associate with the cell\nmembrane, and this protein is stable, then l-fng mRNA\npulses would sequentially increase, in ratchet fashion,\nthe membrane levels of l-fng protein, which become\nproportional to the number of cycles experienced. The\nformation of a new intersomite boundary could then be\ntriggered at a threshold level of l-fng protein. Then,\nonce the somite is formed, a switch of Notch activation\nby Delta and inhibition of Notch activation by Serrate\nto Delta signalling, would allow the formation of a\nboundary and AP pattern, through an induction mech-\nanism (similar to that proposed by Lewis, 1998). That\nis, groups of neighbouring cells, having a locally uni-\nform level of Delta expression, behave cooperatively.\nIn addition, the increasing AP production of l-fng\nprotein would indirectly arrest the segmentation clock\nvia Notch-Delta signalling. In Drosophila and other\ninvertebrates, members of the bHLH gene family, such\nas hairy-1, are the target of notch signalling (Green-\nwald, 1998). The rhythmical expression of c-hairy-1\nand l-fng would be arrested by a regulatory factor\ndownstream to the effect of l-fng protein, explaining\nthe narrowing of the wave front expression of c-hairy-1\nand l-fng in PSM.\n417CLOCK AND INDUCTION MODEL\nFrom the descriptive model that we have given\nabove, it is difficult to fully understand how certain\ntypes of experimental perturbation to various parts of\nthe system would affect the outcome. To this end, a\nmathematical formalisation of the full model would be\nuseful, enabling one to make experimentally testable\npredictions. Below, we show how one of the elements of\nthe model can be expressed in mathematical form. We\nare presently in the process of incorporating this sub-\nmodel into a larger model for the whole process of\nsomitogenesis.\nWe consider the PSM as a one-dimensional growing\ndomain of presomitic clusters that are added caudal to\nHensen\u2019s node at a rate of one cluster per segmentation\nclock cycle. We denote by mi the maturity of the cluster\nadded in the ith cycle and assume that it depends on\nthe total number of cycles experienced by that cluster.\nAt cycle n, we define mi by\nmi 5 n 2 i ~0 # mi # M! (1)\nwhere M is the number of cycles that a cluster must\nexperience before becoming mature. Hence, the initial\nmaturity of a cluster is 0, and after another M cycles,\nits maturity is M, which we take to be the somitic state.\nWe further assume that as a cluster matures, its ability\nto synthesise the signal (l-fng or c-hairy-1, for example)\ndecreases monotonically. Therefore the level, li, of the\nsignal synthesised by the cluster ci has the form\nli 5 fiwi (2)\nwhere wi is a monotonic decreasing function of mi, and\nfi is a function of mi that represents the rhythmical\nexpression of the signal. We assume that fi is zero until\nmi reaches a critical value, at which point it becomes 1\n(after suitable scaling). Figure 1 illustrates how such a\nmodel results in the narrowing of the signalling wave\nas it propagates along the clusters.\nNote that this model incorporates the domain growth\nthat occurs during somitogenesis and assumes that it is\nthe signal that is arrested rather than the clock itself.\nThus, it is different, and in fact simpler, than the\nscenario envisaged in the model proposed by Lewis\n(1997).\nDISCUSSION\nIn this article, we have proposed a global model for\nsomitogenesis, which can explain the formation of\nsomites, their boundaries, and AP patterning. The key\nelements of our model are conserved across protos-\ntomes and deuterostomes, suggesting that segmenta-\ntion in the animal kingdom has some common features.\nPrevious theoretical models have been proposed to\naddress specific experimental observations. These\nmodels were proposed before the first molecular evi-\ndence for a segmentation clock and for the participa-\ntion of the Notch-Delta signalling in somitogenesis.\nAlthough this molecular evidence contradicts many of\nthese models, the models present certain key ideas that\ncan be modified and\/or expanded to take into account\nthe new experimental evidence.\nThe clock and induction model we have proposed is\nconsistent with the experimental facts. The observed\nrhythmical expression of l-fng in PSM results in the\nsynthesis of a stable protein associated with the mem-\nbrane. As new cells are incorporated, older cells at the\nposterior part of the PSM have more l-fng protein than\nthose in the anterior part of the PSM. This creates a\ncell autonomous prepattern along the AP axis, which is\nconsistent with the observation of Meier (1979) and the\nisolation and transplantation experiments (Packard\nand Jacobson, 1976; Chernoff and Hilfer, 1982;\nAoyama and Asamoto, 1988). The AP polarity of the\nsomites is formed by an induction mechanism in the\nNotch-Delta signalling pathway (Lewis, 1998), which\nalso would modulate the signal generated by the clock.\nThe total number of somites is regulated by the rate at\nwhich cells are incorporated in the PSM and\/or by the\nrate of the segmentation clock. Heat shock (Primmett\net al., 1988) would perturb the segmentation clock,\naffecting the formation of somites.\nOur model has focussed on how the cell autonomous\nsignals generated by the clock propagate forward into\nthe PSM to create somites and assumes that the rate of\nregression of Hensen\u2019s node is correlated with the\nspeed at which somites are formed. There are two pos-\nFig. 1. A contour plot showing how the signal l changes in space and\ntime, with maturity decreasing from top to bottom. The shading shows the\nnarrowing of the signal expression as it propagates cranially. For illus-\ntrative proposes, we have taken w 5 1\/(1 1 amh), f 5 1\/(1 1 b expQ),\nwhere Q 5 cos(2pwt) and t is time. Parameter values used are a 5 0.05,\nb 5 10, and h 5 4.\n418 SCHNELL AND MAINI\nsible mechanisms to account for this correlation: the\nregression of Henson\u2019s node may be controlled by the\nsame clock that controls segmentation. Alternatively,\ncells in newly forming somites may signal back to\nHensen\u2019s node, perhaps via the midline structures,\nthus making the model consistent with the results of\nPackard et al. (1993).\nThe great challenge of this model is to understand\nthe function of l-fng or any other possible key compo-\nnent of the molecular mechanisms that link the seg-\nmentation clock with the formation of the somites in\nthe PSM. Further experimental research must be con-\nducted to study how c-hairy-1 and l-fng expressions are\nmodulated by the segmentation clock. At the same\ntime, it is essential to understand the structure of the\nsegmentation clock and how it is modulated. The ex-\nperimental observations presented in this manuscript\nare the consequence of the segmentation clock, but we\ndo not yet know the molecular origin of the clock.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis research (S.S.) has been funded by the Jose\u00b4\nGregorio Herna\u00b4ndez Award (Academia Nacional de\nMedicina, Venezuela; Pembroke College, Oxford), ORS\nAward (Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals\nof the Universities the United Kingdom), Programa de\nCofinanciamiento Institucional IVIC-CONICIT (CONICIT,\nVenezuela), and Lord Miles Senior Scholarship in Sci-\nence (Pembroke College).
