Introduction\nEfforts to observe, model and assess climate change and other environmental stresses have\nprincipally, to date, taken a global or national (e.g. Parson et al. 2003; Harrison et al., 2001)\nperspective. However, there is a widespread view that the next generation of studies should focus at\nthe sub-national (regional) scale, on specific, coherently defined regions, as these represent an\nimportant and underexplored geographical and political foci for analysing the impacts of, and\nresponses to, global change (e.g. McKenzie-Hedger et al 2000; IPCC 2001; Parson et al. 2003).\nTwo beliefs or rationales underpin this regional emphasis. Firstly, that stakeholders will engage more\neffectively with climate change if the impacts can be demonstrated at the local-regional scale with\nwhich they interact, rather than if impacts are only presented at national or international scales. And\nsecondly, that much of the policy response can, and should, be developed and implemented at local\nand regional scales rather than at the national scale. Such a regional scale should allow studies to seek\nadvanced integrated understanding of linked environmental systems and stresses in the region, with\nboth the process detail and spatial resolution necessary to inform regional decision makers. Holman\net al. (Submitted) describes the methodological development of such a sub-national study in the UK-\nthe \u2018Regional Climate Change Impact and Response Studies in East Anglia and North West England\u2019\n(RegIS) study. This paper describes: the results of RegIS for the two study regions, how and to what\nextent adaptation (autonomous and planned) was considered, and discusses the usefulness of the\nmodel results.\n2 The case study regions\nTwo contrasting regions within England were chosen (Figure 1) to allow the diversity of the problems\n3and approaches to be examined within the RegIS sub-national scale study.\nEast Anglia, in the east of England, is approximately 155 km (east-west) by 115 km (north-south). It\nis the least hilly part of Britain, with most land below 60 m above sea level (masl), and appreciable\nareas, such as the Fens, below sea level. The climate of East Anglia is influenced by low relief and its\nproximity to the continent. Compared with other regions of Britain, it is least affected by the\nmoderating influence of the sea, so rainfall is lower and there is a greater daily or monthly\ntemperature range than elsewhere. Rainfall (average annual = 550 - 750 mm) is more or less equally\ndistributed throughout the year. As a consequence of its relatively dry climate and low-lying\ntopography it is one of the most intensively cultivated areas, with an emphasis on arable agriculture.\nThe region is well known for its scenic coastal areas, such as in north Norfolk and important nature\nconservation areas such as The Broads National Park. The area has a relatively low level of\nurbanization, with the exception of key urban centres such as Cambridge and Norwich, which are also\na foci for the high tech industry.\nThe North West of England is the larger of the two regions at approximately 95 km (east-west) by 255\nkm (north-south). It is dominated by the higher (up to about 900 masl) land in the north and along its\neastern boundary, although lower land is found in the west and south of the region. The proximity of\nthe North Atlantic provides a moderating influence on the climate, producing generally milder and\nwetter climate (average annual rainfall = 650 - 3200 mm), allowing for the effects of altitude. The\ndiversity of the physical environment produces a range of farming systems, from rough grazing for\nsheep in the uplands, permanent grassland for sheep and cattle in the lower hills to mixed arable and\ndairy farming in the lowlands. Urban development is focussed in the south of the region, around the\nconurbations of Liverpool and Manchester, and coastal resorts such as Blackpool along the west\ncoast. The Lake District, in the north of the region, is an important National Park whilst other areas\nhave important landscape value.\n2.3 Input Scenarios\n2.3.1 Climate change scenarios\nThe climate change scenarios developed on behalf of the United Kingdom Climate Impacts\nProgramme (UKCIP), known as the UKCIP98 scenarios are reported elsewhere (Hulme and Jenkins,\n1998), but are briefly described for the two regions. Two of the UKCIP98 climate change scenarios\nbased on the HadCM2 global climate model were applied in the RegIS integrated assessment: the\nLow and High scenarios for the 2050s. These represent the lower and upper boundaries of change\n4from the UKCIP98 core scenarios, which account for uncertainties in future global warming rates\nattributable to different climate sensitivities and greenhouse gas emissions scenarios.\nChanges in mean annual temperature of +0.9 and +2.3 \u00b0C are projected for the Low and High\nscenarios for the 2050s, respectively, based on the HadCM2 2.5 \u00b0 latitude x 3.75 \u00b0 longitude grid cell\nencompassing East Anglia. The corresponding figures for the North West region are +0.8 and +2.1\n\u00b0C (based on the mean of the two HadCM2 grid cells encompassing this region). Seasonal changes in\ntemperature are similar to the annual projections. Annual rainfall changes of +1 and +2 % are\nprojected for East Anglia and changes of +3 and +4 % are projected for the North West for the Low\nand High scenarios, respectively. Seasonal differences in rainfall changes are much greater than for\ntemperature, with increases generally projected in winter, autumn and spring and decreases in\nsummer. Decreases in summer rainfall are greater in the East Anglia region (up to 18%) than in North\nWest England (up to 11%). Annual potential evapotranspiration increases by 14 and 29 % in East\nAnglia and by 9 and 22 % in the North West for the Low and High scenarios for the 2050s,\nrespectively. Increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations from the 1961-90\naverage of 334 ppmv to 467 and 528 ppmv by the 2050s (increases of 40 and 58 %) are\nassociated with the projections of climate change from the UKCIP98 Low and High scenarios,\nrespectively. The climate change scenarios were downscaled to a 5km x 5km spatial resolution for\nthe two regions as described in Holman et al (In Prep.).\n2.3.2 Regional socio-economic scenarios\nIt was only feasible to run two of the regional socio-economic scenarios through the integrated impact\nmodels, due to resource and time constraints (Holman et al., in prep). The Regional Enterprise\nscenario was selected because it represents a socio-economic future which is desired by many\nregional stakeholders and potentially imposes a high level of stress upon the environment and natural\nresources (relative to other scenarios). Hence, combining this socio-economic scenario with the High\nclimate change scenario described above generates a future which is likely to be a 'higher\nenvironmental change \/ stress' scenario. The diagonal matching scenario for Regional Enterprise is\nGlobal Sustainability, reflecting a world where socio-economic pressures on environmental systems\nand natural resources are less pronounced. This was combined with the Low climate change scenario\nto generate a 'lower environmental change \/ stress' future.\nThe Regional Enterprise scenario is the most economically 'bullish' of the scenarios, suggesting\nvibrant, semi-autonomous regions, keen to promote and maintain their distinctive qualities in a highly\ncompetitive world. The Regional Enterprise scenario suggests a greater degree of economic and\n5political autonomy than presently. Certain sectors, such as agriculture, will be much more exposed to\nthe market and could decline as a result, although there would be economic support where this\npromotes regional cohesiveness. A high degree of devolution to regional government will encourage\nconsiderably more political control and involvement in planning, development, investment and\nresource management than is currently the case. The environment is seen as a commodity which can\nbe traded, although this does not necessarily imply degradation or loss of resources; where direct\neconomic gain can be demonstrated, then assets will be highly valued.\nEast Anglia under the Regional Enterprise scenario has a higher growth rate than the North West\nand a higher incoming population. Development pressures are, therefore, greater in East Anglia than\nin the North West and occur especially in the Cambridgeshire sub-region, along key transport\ncorridors, and around Norwich. In the North West, the main focus of development will be in the\n'crescent' between Manchester, Liverpool and north Cheshire, and further northwards along key\ntransport corridors. The coastline will be quite extensively developed in East Anglia. Certain sites of\nhigh biodiversity value will be protected in East Anglia and the North West, but the less important\nsites will generally become less protected and more open to development than at present. Agricultural\nsubsidies will be reduced, which will expose agricultural production to more global markets.\nIn the Global Sustainability scenario, the global approaches to achieving sustainable development\ntake precedence over regional responses. The World is seen as an interconnected whole, functionally\nand morally, with a concentration on the wider impacts of individual actions. Through the reformed\nEuropean Common Agricultural Policy, agriculture is directed towards that which is most suitable to\nbe grown locally in the context of a continental scale landmass. Subsidy payments and environmental\ntaxation are used to move agriculture away from intensification. Development patterns reflect a\ndesire to conserve greenfield resources and cities, therefore, become more compact than at present,\ntheir character transformed through city greening and the establishment of pedestrian-oriented\nenclaves. Nevertheless, new greenfield settlements are developed, where these can demonstrate a\nhigh degree of self-containment and the enhancement of the landscape into which they are placed.\nEquity considerations are likely to be increasingly important in general. Biodiversity resources - and\npriorities for conservation and improvement - are seen in a broad spatial context, at the European and\nglobal scales. Water resources are managed as a national-level resource. Coastal protection policy is\ndirected to the most vulnerable regions considered in a national context.\nUnder the Global Sustainability scenario, there is widespread dispersal of development across the\nEast Anglian region (though at a low level compared to the Regional Enterprise scenario), which\nstimulates the growth of locally based solutions to aiding global sustainability, such as co-operative\nventures, farmers\u2019 markets and increased self-governance. In the North West, nearly all new\n6development is concentrated within existing urbanised areas and on brown land and only very limited\nnew coastal development is permitted. As a key vulnerable coastline in Europe, East Anglia's\ncoastline receives particular attention, including planning restrictions and efforts towards managed\nrealignment. Significant parts of the coastal plains of north west and north east Norfolk might be\nallowed to revert to Fenland habitat, also enhancing sustainable flood control.\n3 Results\nThe integrated impact models were applied on a common 5km x 5km spatial grid within the two study\nregions. Five runs were undertaken for each region:\n(i) Baseline (1961-90) conditions;\n(ii) Low climate change scenario for the 2050s coupled with current (1990) socio-economic\nconditions- hereafter referred to as the 2050s Low climate scenario;\n(iii) High climate change scenario for the 2050s coupled with current (1990) socio-economic\nconditions- hereafter referred to as the 2050s High climate scenario;\n(iv) Low climate change scenario coupled with the Global Sustainability socio-economic\nscenario for the 2050s- hereafter referred to as the 2050s Low (Global Sustainability)\nfuture;\n(v) High climate change scenario coupled with the Regional Enterprise socio-economic\nscenario for the 2050s- hereafter referred to as the 2050s High (Regional Enterprise)\nfuture.\nWe discuss the key findings for each region looking at each sector in turn, before analysing adaptation\noptions in response to impacts. Results are summarised in Tables 1 to 4 for the East Anglian and\nNorth West England regions in terms of qualitative plausible futures for the 2050s under the Low\nclimate change scenario linked with the Global Sustainability socio-economic scenario and under the\nHigh climate change scenario linked with the Regional Enterprise socio-economic scenario. Example\nspatially-explicit quantitative model output from the integrated impact models is illustrated in Figure\n2. More detailed analyses for both regions are presented below by sector.\n3.1 Sectoral results\n3.1.1 Coasts and floodplains\nThe global sea-level rise scenarios provided by GCM\u2019s need to be converted to relative sea-level rise\nscenarios (Table 5) for regional impact analyses to reflect the effects of regional land movement.\nHulme and Jenkins (1998) suggest that sea levels will rise 10 % more than the global-mean rise on the\n7UK coast due to climate change-induced regional oceanic changes within the Atlantic. However, the\nchanges in these regional components of sea-level rise are less certain than the global components and\nhave not been included in the analysis. The relative sea level rise obtained from the UKCIP98 Low\nscenario is similar to the continuation of observed trends, while that obtained from the UKCIP98 High\nscenario represents a four-fold and seven-fold acceleration in East Anglia and the North West,\nrespectively. Changes in river flooding are considered via assumed uniform increases in the 1 in 100-\nyear flood flows of 5 % and 20 % for the 2050s Low and 2050s High climate scenarios, respectively.\nThese assumed values are derived from model studies of the impact of climate change on peak flows\nin the Rivers Severn and Thames (Reynard et al., 1999) in the absence of better data. However, the\ncatchment modelling conducted within RegIS is consistent with an increase in flood risk along rivers,\nparticularly in the North West (see Section 3.1.3).\nThe 2050s High (Regional Enterprise) future includes increased development in coastal and flood\nplain developments as well as a focus on \u201chold the line\u201d in shoreline management. Therefore, there is\nlittle interest in policies, such as managed realignment, which would allow declining saltmarshes to\nmigrate landward. The 2050s Low (Global Sustainability) future also sees increased development in\nboth regions, but with careful land use planning steering these developments away from flood-prone\nareas. There is also significant habitat re-creation to maintain and enhance natural and semi-natural\nhabitats within areas such as the Fens, and widespread managed realignment along the coast.\nClimate change has profound implications for coastal areas and river valleys, especially in East\nAnglia. The effect of the relative sea-level rise scenarios on coastal flooding, as given by raising the\nsurge heights as determined by Dixon and Tawn (1997) by the magnitude of sea-level rise, is shown\nin Table 6 for the case of the 100-year event. It shows that the increases in sea level given in Table 5\nwill significantly increase the frequency of flooding, unless flood defences are raised. Flooding in the\n2050s is enhanced by all the climate change scenarios, but the impacts are much greater under the\n2050s High climate scenario. Sea defences, which presently provide protection to a 1 in 100 year\nstandard, would be reduced to the range of a 2- to 8-year standard by the 2050s under this scenario.\n(By the 2080s, many of these defences would be at or below a 1-year standard under this scenario).\nWithout adaptation, the interaction of sea-level rise, increased river floods and ongoing\nsubsidence\/peat oxidation could lead to severe and extensive flood impacts in the Fens of East Anglia,\nleading to the large-scale abandonment of this prime agricultural area. Significant flood impacts\nwould also occur in the Norfolk Broads in East Anglia and the Lancashire coastal plainin the North\nWest. Under the 2050s High climate scenario, analysis suggests that arable agriculture would be\nprecluded by the high frequency of flooding over 86 % of the Fens, 10 % of the remainder of East\nAnglia, and 7 % of the North West. Most of this land is expected to revert to grazing marsh, while in\nthe Fens it is expected to revert to a mixture of grazing marsh and fenland, although this will also\n8depend on the land management regime (e.g. amount of grazing). Existing allowances for future sea-\nlevel rise in flood defence project guidance (MAFF 1999) would more than compensate for the\nlimited impacts of the 2050s Low climate scenario, but would only reduce the flood impacts of the\n2050s High climate scenario.\nOrder-of-magnitude calculations of average annual flood damage to properties at the region-scale are\ngiven in Table 7 for two protection scenarios defined by Halcrow Maritime et al. (2000):\n1. Maintaining present levels of protection (consistent with the RegIS assumptions); and\n2. Meeting indicative standards (upgrading some substandard defences to the indicative\nstandard, and then maintaining these defence elevations).\nThey show that all climate change scenarios increase damages. However, raising all flood defences to\nthe present indicative standard would more than counter the impacts of the 2050s Low climate\nscenario. In contrast, the 2050s High climate scenario significantly increases average annual flood\ndamages, with coastal damages increasing 20-fold in East Anglia. Collectively, the total losses in the\nAnglian (i.e. a bigger region than assessed in RegIS) and North West regions of the Environment\nAgency could exceed \u00a3700 million and \u00a3400 million\/year, respectively. The 2050s High (Regional\nEnterprise) future will enhance these impacts due to increased exposure to flooding. The annual\ndamages would increase by an additional 35 to 42 %, so that the main factor increasing flood damage\nis the more frequent flooding of areas which have already been developed. Therefore, flood impacts\ncould be significantly enhanced by climate change, while socio-economic changes could produce\nimportant additional impacts.\nThe area of saltmarsh and coastal grazing marsh will change in response to climate and non-climate\nchange, with both losses and gains being possible. However, much coastal grazing marsh is a man-\nmade habitat which depends on artificial flood defence as it occupies former intertidal areas. There\nare limited coastal areas for grazing marsh creation, so losses are likely to predominate. Sea-level rise\nmay produce losses of saltmarsh, while planned and unplanned coastal realignment will produce gains\nof saltmarsh and associated intertidal habitats. Thus, gains of saltmarsh will often produce losses of\ncoastal grazing marsh, which is expected to decline in area under all scenarios. At the local scale,\nadaptation options are limited, as there is little suitable space to create replacement habitat within the\ncoastal zone. A balance may need to be struck to sustain coastal grazing marsh as a habitat, or\nalternatively grazing marsh will need to be created in more sustainable, non-coastal locations. At the\nregional scale, replacement freshwater habitats might be recreated at more inland locations. This\nhabitat creation could be part of innovative approaches to fluvial flood management, and hence tackle\nmultiple problems.\n9Under the 2050s Low climate scenario, saltmarsh losses are confined to the Suffolk coast, while under\nthe 2050s High climate scenario, saltmarsh losses occur around the entire East Anglian coast. These\nlosses are further exacerbated under the 2050s High (Regional Enterprise) future due to reduced\nsediment availability. Although sea-level rise threatens existing saltmarshes, managed realignment,\nand\/or possible coastal abandonment of low value areas that are flooded frequently, could lead to no\nnet change or even a substantial net gain in the area of saltmarsh habitats. The saltmarshes in the\nNorth West are predicted to remain stable under all the climate change scenarios, which is a function\nof the high tidal range in this region. Unplanned retreat and coastal abandonment in response to sea-\nlevel rise could even lead to net saltmarsh gains. However, additional saltmarsh losses could occur in\nboth regions due to processes other than sea-level rise: increased wave action due to increased\nstorminess is one possible driver. Under the 2050s Low (Global Sustainability) future there is\nsignificant saltmarsh and intertidal habitat gain in both regions and a consequent coastal grazing\nmarsh decline. Compensating habitat creation in non-coastal locations could occur in river valleys\nand coastal lowlands such as the Fens. In conclusion, for coastal ecosystems, climate change has\nimportant impacts for biodiversity (See Section 3.1.4), but human management of the coast also has\nan important control on the evolution of habitat.\n3.1.2 Agriculture\nThe crop model shows yield changes are sensitive to the climate scenarios. In the 2050s Low climate\nscenario, yields of crops generally increase, mainly due to the increased CO2, but yield increases are\nless with the higher temperatures under the 2050s High climate scenario as crops begin to suffer\nmoisture stress in the summer, particularly in the drier East Anglian region, and earlier maturity\nreduces the amount of solar radiation received. For example, the decrease in intercepted radiation and\nincreased droughtiness means that in most years there is a 10 % reduction in wheat yield in the 2050s\nHigh climate scenario compared to 1995. However, this is more than compensated for by the CO2\nfertilisation effect, which increases yields by approximately 17 %. The yield of grass shows a\ndifferent pattern and does not increase as much as arable crops in the 2050s Low climate scenario but\ncontinues to increase in the 2050s High climate scenario as most growth occurs early in the season\nbefore soil moisture restrictions develop. Yields increase by 30% in nearly all areas under the 2050s\nHigh climate scenario. The yields of irrigated potato and sugar beet also increase, but show the same\ntrend as wheat, with greater increases under the 2050s Low climate scenario compared to the 2050s\nHigh climate scenario.\nThe farm model indicates that the distribution of cropping in the East Anglian region shows little\nchange in type of cropping except due to socio-economic change. In the East Anglian region under\n10\nthe 2050s High climate scenario, there is a large area deemed no longer suitable for arable agriculture\ndue to increased flooding as shown in Figures 2 and 3. The area of grass has also increased to almost\ndouble its current area under the 2050s High climate scenario, although it is still a low proportion of\nthe total. The majority of this increase is due to land changing from arable to pastoral agriculture due\nto the risk of flooding. However, despite the crop yield changes, the distribution of cropping shows\nthat when the socio-economic scenario is unchanged, the major cropping is also little changed.\nIrrigated potatoes, however, which are not currently widespread, double in area. The area of sugar\nbeet using 200mm irrigation also increases, particularly in the 2050s Low climate scenario.\nElsewhere the distribution of cropping is very sensitive to the socio-economic scenarios, consistent\nwith the results of Abler et al (2002), with both socio-economic scenarios producing substantial\nchanges. In the East Anglian region, the proportion of the area in winter crops reduces under all\nscenarios, due to corresponding increases in spring crops, sugar beet and potatoes. For the given\nprices in the socio-economic scenarios, the results suggest that the area of irrigated potato fields\nwould double. The yields of sugar beet and potatoes increase most in the crop simulation. The\nlargest increase in potatoes is in the south of the region. The overall level of irrigation required in the\nEast Anglian region increases from 23 to 30 mm\/ha\/yr (Figure 4). The increased cost of water in the\nsocio-economic scenarios has little effect on reducing the amount of water used for irrigation, but the\nimproved technology of the Global Sustainability scenario has a substantial effect on water use..\nThe distribution of cropping in the North West region also shows little change in cropping type with\nclimate change and the current socio-economic scenario, but both socio-economic scenarios generate\na large increase in arable cropping, due to the reduced competitiveness of dairy farming. Switching\nfrom grass to arable, as suggested in the North West, is a major capital change which is not easy to\nreverse. In the short term, very few farms will change, but as the viable area expands and the relative\nprofitability of arable agriculture in the scenarios continues, more farms will do so. The distribution of\narable cropping shows changes which largely mirror those in the East Anglian region. The increase in\ntemperature means that most of the lowland (lower than 200 m above sea level) and upland (between\n200 m and 300 m above sea level) areas are now suitable in terms of maturity for winter wheat, sugar\nbeet and potatoes, in agreement with Davies et al. (1997). As occurs in the East Anglian region,\ncropping in the 2050s High (Regional Enterprise) future is dominated by cereals, sugar beet and\npotatoes, because all other break crops loose their subsidies. This is almost certainly not an\neconomically sustainable position and prices would adjust. The 2050s Low (Global Sustainability)\nfuture is almost the reverse of this situation with peas, beans, linseed and oilseed rape providing one\nthird of the arable cropping.\nIn the North West region, the proportion of the area in sugar beet shows a large increase throughout\nthe lowland areas and penetration northwards, though in this region most of it is unirrigated. The\n11\noverall level of irrigation required in the North West region is, in the highest scenario, only about 6\nmm\/ha\/yr. There is the potential for sugar beet, and the increase suggests that by the 2050s there will\nbe a case for a sugar beet factory in this region, although the crop is probably still too sparse to justify\na factory in the extreme north. However, the need for a processing factory would depend on the\nnational demand for sugar. In the upland areas, the area of farmed grass only reduces from 95 % to 93\n% of the area in the 2050s High climate scenario, but under the 2050s High (Regional Enterprise)\nfuture this reduces to 83 % of the upland area. There is also a very large reduction in farmed grass in\nthe lowland areas in this scenario. It has been assumed that the Hill areas (higher than 300 m above\nsea level) which are unsuitable for arable cropping remain as rough grazing.\nThe crop nitrogen requirement in East Anglia is almost unchanged for all the scenarios except for the\n2050s High (Regional Enterprise) future, in which the large increase in the yields of the crops means\nthat there are correspondingly large increases in the economic optimum level of nitrogen to be\napplied. Combined with the change in cropping this amounts to an increase of over 60 %. However,\nthe estimate of nitrate-nitrogen leaching is almost unchanged in all the climate-only scenarios,\nalthough it increases by over 20 % in the two combined climate and socio-economic scenarios.\n3.1.3 Water resources\nThe UKCIP98 climate change scenarios show an increase in annual average rainfall in all 2050s\nscenarios (in comparison to the baseline) with the winters becoming wetter, partly at the expense of\nthe summer. The more clement climate in East Anglia and the North West leads to an increase in the\nlength of the growing season. It takes longer for the soils to wet up in the autumn and they start\ndrying out sooner in the spring, so that there is a median decrease in the recharge period in East\nAnglia of 0.5 and 2.5 weeks in the 2050s Low and 2050 High climate scenarios, respectively.\nWhether the increase in rainfall in a given area leads to an increase in hydrologically effective rainfall\n(HER), depends upon a balance between the increase in winter rainfall, the decrease in the length of\nthe recharge period and the increase in winter evapo-transpiration (consistent with Hulme & Jenkins,\n1998). HER is likely to decrease in most of East Anglia (with the exception of coastal areas) and the\nlowland areas of the North West in all scenarios. For most of the hydrological indicators, the regional\npatterns of change are similar under all scenarios but with a greater magnitude of change under the\n2050s High climate change scenario combined with the Regional Enterprise socio-economic scenario.\nThe socio-economic scenarios affect the average annual HER predictions in two ways. Firstly,\nincreased urbanisation and area of hard surfaces (concrete, asphalt etc.) decreases evapo-transpiration\nand consequently leads to locally increased HER. Secondly, the socio-economic scenarios can cause\n12\nregional changes in land use and resulting evapo-transpiration. For example, in the 2050s High\n(Regional Enterprise) future compared to the2050s High climate scenario in East Anglia there is a\nsmall (median of 1%) regional increase in average annual HER, which appears to result from an\nincrease in the cultivation of spring cereals and spring-sown crops (especially sugar beet), at the\nexpense of autumn-sown crops.\nThe gross groundwater resource (which supports the baseflow in rivers and most wetlands and, where\naquifers are present, supports abstraction) decreases slightly over much of East Anglia with the 2050s\nLow scenario, with the exception of the coastal water resource units where droughty (sandy and very\nthin chalk) soils dominate. In the 2050s Low climate scenario and 2050s Low (Global Sustainability)\nfuture, low flows in East Anglia are predicted to remain virtually unchanged. Under the 2050s High\nclimate scenario low flows generally decrease in most catchments, by up to 25%, but under the 2050s\nHigh (Regional Enterprise) future, the low flows increase in a number catchments. Most catchments\nin the North West show a small increase of up to 5% in low flows under the 2050s Low climate\nscenario (with the exception of those in the Lancashire coastal plain and the south-east of the RegIS\narea where flows decrease by up to 5%), but a regional decrease under the 2050s High climate\nscenario, this decrease tending to increase from about -5% in the north to -20% in the south.\nAlthough domestic and industrial water consumption patterns have not been modelled within RegIS,\nthe combination of the simulated decrease in gross groundwater resource over most of East Anglia\nand the decrease in low flows in many catchments with the changes in urbanisation and water demand\nenvisaged under the 2050s High (Regional Enterprise) future scenario, suggests that changes to the\nwater supply\/transfer infrastructure or the implementation of demand-side adaptation, may be\nrequired in some areas. The reduction in low flows may lead to an increased risk of saline incursion\nin the lower reaches of coastal rivers beyond the current upper tidal limit, especially under the 2050s\nHigh climate scenario. The risk will be greatest in East Anglia, due to the general lower flows, flatter\ntopography and greater sea level rise, although it may still be important in some North Western\ncatchments around the Mersey and Ribble estuaries.\nAlthough high flows are not expected to increase greatly in East Anglia, the maximum simulated\nweekly flow increases in many catchments. This suggests that fluvial flooding, without the influence\nof the tides, is likely to increase in East Anglia, supporting the use of increased peak flows in the\nflooding analysis. Many of the catchments where high flows are predicted to increase are located in\ncoastal areas. If the timing of high flows coincides with the higher tide levels associated with sea\nlevel rise and \/ or increased storminess (tidal surges), there may be a significantly increased likelihood\nof fluvial flooding in downstream areas. This particular increase in flood risk in coastal catchments is\nconsistent with the UK Foresight flood results (Watkinson et al., 2003) Fluvial flooding is\n13\nincreasingly likely in the North West, due to the increased winter precipitation and hydrologically\neffective rainfall. There is a general increase in the 5th percentile weekly flow of up to 5% in the\n2050s Low climate scenario and 2050s Low (Global Sustainability) future and up to 10% in the 2050s\nHigh climate scenario and 2050s High (Regional Enterprise) future. However, as the models do not\ninclude snow melt, the future flood risk in catchments that currently experience flooding primarily\ndue to snow melt in the spring may be less in 2050s, due to the raised winter temperatures and\nconsequently lower snow accumulation.\nUnder all scenarios and futures, there is little change (of up to \u00b1 1 mg\/l) in the median groundwater\nnitrate-N concentration, except for in The Broads, coastal Suffolk and the Fens under the 2050s High\nclimate scenario and 2050s High (Regional Enterprise) future, where the median concentrations\ndecrease greatly, as the increased flood risk has caused a land use change from arable to permanent\ngrassland and an associated reduction in leaching. A similar pattern of little change (of up to \u00b1 1\nmg\/l), except for areas of increased flood risk, is observed in median surface water nitrate-N\nconcentrations in East Anglia. Under all scenarios and futures, the predicted surface water median\nnitrate-N concentration decreases by up to 0.5 mg\/l) in almost all of the catchments in the North West\nNot all water quality indicators will behave in a similar manner to the changes brought about by\nclimate change. The increased average air temperatures throughout the year expected with climate\nchange will lead to similar (though lower) increases in water temperature. The dissolved oxygen\ncontent of water is inversely related to water temperature so that there may be increased risks of low\ndissolved oxygen content in some rivers, especially when low flows are particularly predicted to\ndecrease.\nFuture water quality with regard to pesticide pollution is less clear for two main reasons. Firstly,\npesticides are continually being developed with higher adsorption potential and shorter half lives, so\nthat their environmental losses are much lower than older compounds. In addition, the shortening of\nthe \u2018recharge\u2019 period will provide agricultural users with a longer time-window, after the autumn\napplications of pesticide, before run-off occurs. Pesticide degradation may therefore be greater.\nHowever, the potential for rapid by-pass flow may increase in some areas due to the likely increased\ncracking of soils because of the warmer summers. If intense rain events occur soon after pesticide\napplications in the autumn, then there will remain the scope for high, short duration, losses.\n3.1.4 Biodiversity\nTwenty eight species associated with four habitats in each region, which were important due to\ndominance, sensitivity, or conservation designation, were chosen by the regional stakeholders.\n14\nChanges in the potential distribution of suitable climate space are summarized in Table 6 and\npresented in full in Berry et al. (2001). The results provide further evidence that species, despite\nhaving apparently similar initial distributions, respond individually to climate change leading to\ntotally new distributions and habitat composition (Huntley et al., 1995; Cannon, 1998; Bale et al.,\n2002). In general, southern species, such as Plebejus argus (Silver-studded blue butterfly) and\nScandix pecten-veneris (Shepherd\u2019s needle), exhibit a potential to expand their range northwards, as\nconditions for their growth and reproduction become more favourable. The range of northern species,\nsuch as Blysmus rufus (Flat sedge) and Alchemilla alpina (Alpine lady\u2019s mantle), contracts, as\nclimatic conditions for survival become less favourable. Only one species (Erebia epiphron,\nMountain ringlet) of the 28 modelled could lose all suitable climate space.\nThe consequences of climate change for the different habitats depends on the sensitivity of the\ncomponent species (Berry et al, 2002). Where the trend for component species is consistent, as is the\ncase for the Arctic-Alpine and coastal grazing marsh habitats, then it could be assumed that they\nwould retract or expand their range respectively. This assumption is based on other component\nspecies showing a similar response. Elsewhere, the future of the habitat appears to depend much more\non the species under consideration. If the dominants continue to find suitable climate space, as is the\ncase in upland hay meadows, blanket and raised bog and cereal field margins, then it could be\nassumed that the habitat would continue in existence, but with a slightly different species\ncomposition. Saltmarsh and fens, however, show a mixed species\u2019 response. In these cases, additional\nmodelling of a wider range of species would help to test the above assumptions.\nThe North West is a critical area for climate change impact studies, because within it lies the climatic\ndivide between the warmer, drier, south east of Britain and the cooler, wetter, north west of the\ncountry (Rodwell, 1998). Species here, therefore, are particularly sensitive to climate change,\nespecially if they are near their range margins. The Arctic-Alpine habitat is the most sensitive as all\nspecies lose suitable climate space. In East Anglia all the selected species should continue to find\nsuitable climate space, except Puccinellia maritima (Common saltmarsh grass), chosen as part of the\nsaltmarsh habitat in the North West, which could lose suitability in East Anglia under the 2050s High\nclimate scenario. This scenario also shows that two fen species, Epipactis palustris (Marsh\nhelleborine) and Valeriana dioica (Marsh valerian) could start to experience a contraction in their\nclimate space in the region. This is most likely due to increasing soil moisture deficits. Balanced\nagainst this there is the potential for two lowland heathland species, Plejebus argus (Silver-studded\nblue butterfly) and Silene otites (Spanish catchfly), to expand their ranges, such that the former could\nfind suitable climate space in the North West region.\n15\nThe future of both species and habitats are not only affected by their direct response to climate\nchange, but also depend on the impacts of climate change and socio-economics on the other sectors.\nThe integration of the SPECIES outputs with those from the other sectors showed that although\ncoastal grazing marsh species could expand their ranges, nevertheless, the localized existence of the\nhabitat could be threatened by losses due to sea level rise, particularly under the 2050s High (Regional\nEnterprise) future in East Anglia. Some areas of saltmarshes in East Anglia could also be lost to sea\nlevel rise and this, combined with the loss of potential climate space for some species, could mean\nthat the habitat undergoes significant changes in the future. Lowland heathland in East Anglia should\nbe able to maintain its species composition, but its existence is under pressure from agriculture. The\ncereal field margin species, however, are more dependent on cropping practices. The upland hay\nmeadows would be affected by moves away from low intensity agriculture in the North West,\nparticularly under the 2050s High (Regional Enterprise) future which shows a reduction in farmed\ngrass and a large increase in arable cropping. Changing water levels are an issue for both blanket and\nraised bogs and fens, with changes for the latter habitat exacerbating simulated stresses from the\ndirect effects of climate change for certain species. Impacts are summarised for each habitat:\n\uf0b7 Upland hay meadows: the dominant species, Anthoxanthum odoratum and Cynosurus cristatus,\nwill not lose climate space, but Geranium sylvaticum, another characteristic, but sensitive, plant\nmight. They are all susceptible to changes in agricultural practices, particularly intensification\nand changing grazing regimes.\n\uf0b7 Blanket and raised bogs: the dominant species, Eriophorum vaginatum and Myrica gale, will\ncontinue to find suitable climate space over most of Great Britain. There is a potential for this to\nincrease for Rhynchospora alba, but Coenonympha tullia, the more sensitive of the species, is\nlikely to have an increasingly restricted distribution. Changes in water levels, frequency of\nflooding and water quality could have adverse effects on all the species.\n\uf0b7 Saltmarshes: individual species show differing sensitivities to climate change, such that in the\nNorth West their composition may be altered by the potential loss of Blysmus rufus under the\n2050s High climate scenario, but overall their existence appears unlikely to be threatened by\nclimate change. In parts of East Anglia, however, there is a loss of suitable climate space for all\nof the other modelled species (Atriplex portulacoides, Puccinellia maritima and Suaeda\nmaritima). This is compounded under some scenarios by a loss of habitat.\n\uf0b7 Arctic-Alpine: this habitat is the most sensitive to climate change, but the species modelled may\nnot necessarily lose all suitable climate space under the 2050s Low climate scenario, except in the\ncase of Erebia epiphron. Further, even under the 2050s High climate scenario the other species\n(Rubus chamaemorus, Salix herbacea and Alchemilla alpina) should be able to survive, but with\nvery restricted distributions.\n16\n\uf0b7 Lowland heath: all species (Erica tetralix, Silene otites and Plebejus argus) continue to find\nsuitable climate space in the region and Silene otites, a rare species, could even expand.\nHowever, habitat availability is very dependent on any changes in the area of agriculture, which is\nunlikely to increase under most scenarios.\n\uf0b7 Cereal field margins: all species (Galium aparine, Papaver rhoeas and Scandix pecten-veneris)\ncontinue to find suitable climate space in the region, and could benefit slightly from the possible\nincreases both in arable cropping in East Anglia (excluding the Fens) and in the greater proportion\nof spring crops. The benefits of the latter, however, may be compromised by the nature of the\ncrops.\n\uf0b7 Fens: parts of East Anglia could become unsuitable under the 2050s High climate scenario for all\nthe species (Epipactis palustris, Ranunculus scleratus and Valeriana dioica), except Glyceria\nmaxima, a dominant, and water levels in summer could become critical for their survival. In the\nFens and The Broads, these species may be able to benefit from the increased flooding, but near\nthe coast they may have to show a certain salt tolerance.\n\uf0b7 Coastal grazing marsh: all species (Ranunuculus baudotii, Ranunculus sardous and Trifolium\nfragiferum) could expand their potential climate range, but will be dependent on habitat\navailability. Most scenarios show habitat losses due to saltmarsh movement inland, but gains\ncould come from flooding of arable land and re-creation.\nThe SPECIES model only shows where there would be potentially suitable climate space in the\nfuture; it does not show actual future distributions. Where the occupation of this space would involve\nlarge-scale movement outside a species\u2019 current range, as is the case for Atriplex portucaloides, Silene\notites, Plejebus argus and Scandix pecten-veneris, then questions must be asked about the ability of\nthe species to realise such climate space. Atriplex portucaloides may be able to fill its potential future\nclimate space because it is a saltmarsh species that can be distributed by ocean currents, but the\nothers, which are dependent on terrestrial migration, are unlikely to be able to emulate this in the\ntime-scales involved. Habitat availability will also be important in affecting the migrational ability of\nsuch terrestrial species. The next step, therefore, is to combine the distributions of future climate\nspace with models of species dispersal and habitat availability (Pearson et al. 2004).\n4 Discussion of the results\n4.1 Adaptation issues\nThe final stage of the DPSIR framework that has guided the RegIS analysis is the \u2018response\u2019 to\nenvironmental impacts, which refers to the possibility of adaptation to specific changes in the state of\n17\na system. In terms of the IPCC guidelines for climate impact assessment (Carter et al., 1994; Parry\nand Carter, 1998) these adaptation responses are of two general types: autonomous adaptation (e.g.\nthe spontaneous or habitual responses and decisions of natural systems, individuals and organisations\nto change their day-to-day actions or management in response to changing circumstances) and policy\nimplementation (e.g. the political decision to regulate against an adverse outcome or to support certain\ndevelopment pathways).\nLike other recent assessments (e.g. Parson et al. 2003), RegIS identified many potential adaptation\noptions to reduce climate impacts, but was unable to conduct systematic assessment of these options\ndue to resource and time constraints and gaps in existing data and analysis. Autonomous adaptation is\nimplicit in the agricultural model and partially in the biodiversity model. Although no policy\nimplementation was explicitly modelled, RegIS also more implicitly addressed the potential for\nadaptation based on policy by examining the consequences of the different socio-economic scenarios\nthat were based on alternative visions of future societal attitudes.\n4.1.1 Sector-specific adaptation strategies\nCoasts\nThe results assumed no adaptation to climate change and so, identified the worst-case impacts.\nAdaptation to the increased flood risk include raising flood defences, avoiding development on flood\nplains and managed realignment, implemented within a strategic approach to coastal management.\nProactive adaptation is already in evidence in the UK, including shoreline management planning,\nimplemented since 1995 (DEFRA, 2001; Cooper et al., 2002). Since 1989, MAFF has provided\nguidance on an allowance for accelerated sea-level rise in the design of new tidal flood defences of 6\nmm\/yr in East Anglia and 4 mm\/yr in the North West. This is more than sufficient to counter the Low\nclimate change scenario, but under the High climate change scenario there might still be a seven-fold\nincrease in average annual flood damages by the 2050s. Therefore, it is important to monitor actual\nchanges in sea level around the British Isles, so that the timing and magnitudes of any acceleration\ncan be observed and factored into flood defence policy. Similarly, the possibility of increased\nstorminess under climate change needs further investigation and continuous monitoring, as the\nimpacts described above might be generated by the combination of sea-level rise and increased\nstorminess, rather than sea-level rise alone.\nThe Fens in East Anglia present particular problems in terms of responding to the identified flood\nproblems. Raising flood defences will be very expensive due to soil conditions. Therefore, wider\n18\nriver channels might be more appropriate, although this will be very costly, possibly combined with\nstorm surge barriers to keep surges at bay. At the same time, there is great interest in habitat re-\ncreation in the Fens, and it might be possible to combine flood management and habitat creation if\nthere is more strategic planning. Other issues that should be urgently considered are land use\nplanning so that the necessary corridors for flood management are kept open. The Fens are the largest\ncoastal lowland in Britain and a strategic Fens plan on flood management, analogous to the open-\ncoast shoreline management plans would seem a prudent measure. Such a plan should include the\nentire Fens, and would necessarily extend beyond the RegIS area.\nWhile saltmarsh is threatened by sea-level rise around much of the coast, there seems to be sufficient\nscope for habitat re-creation, via managed realignment, to sustain saltmarsh if that objective is agreed.\nThe management issue is more concerned with coastal grazing marsh and related freshwater habitats\nsuch as at key locations along the North Norfolk and Suffolk coastline. Climate change and coastal\nmanagement are moving in the same direction and a decline in coastal grazing marsh seems almost\ninevitable. This raises the question of the strategic replacement of these coastal habitats with non-\ncoastal grazing marsh. Regional or national scale plans to accomplish this goal would seem to be\nprudent.\nAgricultural land use\nThe results suggest that even in the extreme climate change scenario considered, substantial increases\nin yields of staple crops, such as wheat, are likely. This could be regarded as a problem of even more\nover production or an advantage of more produce to export to areas potentially in need. In the former\ncase, more land will need to be taken out of production or alternative uses found. It should be noted\nthat this study has not considered horticultural crops and whether there are possibilities for a longer\ngrowing season so that locally grown UK produce might replace produce currently imported from the\nMediterranean areas. In the latter case, there will be increased fertiliser inputs required as these are\nlargely correlated with output and there will be the usual need to cope with any remaining differences\nbetween European and world prices and the storage implications of fluctuations in production.\nHowever, there seems little difference between this and current problems of increased yield due to\ntechnology.\nThe comparison of the economic effect and the climate effect, suggests that most problems due to\nclimate change will occur to a much greater magnitude due to economic and technical changes.\nSwitching from grass to arable, as suggested in the North West, is a major change which is not easy to\nreverse. The models do not address the issue of major capital changes required when switching\nbetween types of farming, instead determining the type that is profitable within the economic scenario\n19\npresented. This represents the probability that a farm will change type and the greater the difference\nin profit, the greater the chance. In the short term, very few farms will change, but as the relative\nprofitability continues more farms will. Expansion of the areas where arable crops are viable must put\npressure on grassland as it represents an alternative that did not previously exist. Periods of low\nprices for grass-based products over the next 50 years, which will always occur from time to time,\ncombined with quality of life considerations, will thus inevitably cause a gradual change from grass to\narable in the North West.\nThe modelling results suggest that many new areas will be capable of growing viable crops of sugar\nbeet, if only there were a factory. This is likely to lead to a fall in price paid to UK farmers under the\nnational sugar beet quota system. However, this could be balanced by greater export demand for UK\nsugar beet due to southern areas in continental Europe losing production. The need for greater\nirrigation in East Anglia to maintain yields under climate change, and its limited availability, may\npush the viability to the North West. It may therefore be more efficient to encourage a factory sited in\nthe North West e.g. Cheshire, than to encourage reservoirs for irrigation in East Anglia or pipelines to\nimport water from outside of the region. However, significant capital investment would be required\nby farmers and contractors in the North West. Similar questions relate to potatoes, although there is\nless concentration of potato factories for crisps and chips.\nAlthough sunflower was the only crop to be considered in the modelling that is not currently widely\ngrown in the UK, it seems likely that grain maize and soybean will also gradually become viable.\nCertainly as other crops become over produced because of the increased yield and the expansion of\nviable production areas, these might become best choices, as appeared to occur in the cases where\nthey were selected. The gradual introduction of these crops seems likely to need some knowledge\nsupport by government research and development and agronomy providers. Many of these crops are\nalready imported and processed but some storage, markets and processing facilities in appropriate\nplaces may need to be encouraged. Negotiations with the European Community or World Trade\nOrganization should not exclude the future possibility of these crops being grown in the UK as\nmainstream crops.\nWater\nIt is likely that the potential demand for water will increase in the future. Herrington (1996) predicted\nthat the aggregate demand for water in the south and east of England for 2021 will increase in all\nsectors, with the overall increase dominated by the domestic sector and irrigation. The results of the\nRegIS modelling for the 2050s time-period, suggest that significant parts of East Anglia and the\n20\nsouthern part of the North West will experience reduced groundwater recharge, whilst many of the\nrivers in both regions will have decreased summer flows. The resulting reduced availability of water\nin both regions and the increased aggregate demand have the potential, therefore, to place strains on\nwater users and the water environment. However, the magnitude of the impacts of climate change\nwill depend on the nature of the physical infrastructure and the ability of the institutions managing\nwater to adapt (Arnell, 1996; 2000). Adaptation can occur in the:\n\uf0b7 Supply side e.g. the use of water transfer schemes, the construction of new reservoirs, more\nefficient exploitation of existing resources such as through artificial recharge of aquifers or\nconjunctive use schemes, reallocation of licences and resources amongst different users according\nto altered priorities and increased use of grey water;\n\uf0b7 Demand side e.g. water conservation measures, abstraction licence restrictions, hosepipe bans,\nwater supply metering, differential water pricing.\nOther options within a catchment context include changes in the methods by which the land is\nmanaged, in order to increase the infiltration of rainfall and reduce run-off (for example by direct\ndrilling rather than conventional autumn cultivation on some soil types).\nWithin the context of the future worlds investigated within RegIS, the RegIS socio-economic\nscenarios and the results of the modelling suggest the following may occur:\n2050s High (Regional Enterprise) future\n\u2022 There will be increase overall demand for water due to increased population and domestic water\ndemand (especially for East Anglia and Cumbria) and increased irrigation demand, for sugar beet and\npotatoes in East Anglia, despite increased price of water. Water management will be increasingly\nfocussed at regional as opposed to national or EU level and while water transfers out of the regions\n(especially East Anglia) will cease, water transfers into these relatively affluent regions will be\ninvestigated. However, demand management will be favoured over major infrastructure\ndevelopments, e.g. new reservoir, due to lower costs.\n2050s Low (Global sustainability) future\n\u2022 There will be less pressure on water resources as there is little change in population in the two RegIS\nregions and irrigation demand will decrease due to land use change and increased usage efficiency.\nWater resources will be managed at the national and EU level. There will be a strong focus on\ndemand management, such as leakage reduction, in the two regions to control increased potential\ndemand and water transfers out of region will be dependent on demand management in receiving\nregions.\n21\nWithin both the 2050s High (Regional Enterprise) and 2050s Low (Global sustainability) futures, it is\nlikely that restrictions on nitrate application to land (such as the Nitrate Vulnerable Zone designation\nunder the current EC Nitrates Directive) will continue to be required in East Anglia to control nitrate\nconcentrations in surface and groundwaters.\nChanges in water management tend to come about through both a series of small, incremental\nadjustments based upon accumulated experience and more drastic, crisis-oriented responses\n(Riebsame, 1988; Arnell, 1996). It is likely, therefore, that the adaptive responses for water\nmanagement will be based on flexible, integrated strategies incorporating both supply and demand\nmanagement, rather than relying on the financially, environmentally and politically contentious large\ninfrastructure schemes.\nSpecies distributions\nThe possibility of autonomous adaptation due to a species expanding its range into new potential\nclimate space depends on its dispersal ability and the role of long-distance dispersal (Higgins and\nRichardson, 1999). Coastal species should be able to spread on ocean currents, but other species have\nvariable migrational ability. Most plant species are unlikely, in the time-scale under consideration, to\nbe able to fulfil their total new potential climate space where this represents an increase in their range\nnorthwards, even if long-distance dispersal occurs. Other taxa may have greater dispersal ability.\nMost butterflies disperse short distances, although it is possible that individuals may be blown longer\ndistances, but their survival then depends on them finding a suitable habitat.\nSpecies which are losing suitable climate space nationally e.g. Arctic-Alpines and regionally e.g.\nEriophorum vaginatum and Puccinellia maritima in East Anglia, are more likely to be in equilibrium\nwith their contracting climate space, but populations may be able to persist in microhabitats, for\nexample Arctic-Alpines on north-facing slopes. There is probably little that can be done for the\nformer set of species, other than reducing any known additional stresses. Local losses are less\nsignificant providing the species has adequate climate space elsewhere, but may be of concern where\nit is an important component of a habitat. Salt marshes in East Anglia, for example, may experience\nconsiderable changes in species composition, but there are species that could substitute, although it\nmight lead to decreased diversity, at least in the short-term.\nIncreasing the size of habitat by expanding designated\/protected areas will help in the continuance of\na species in a particular location, with a focus perhaps on reserves towards or immediately beyond the\n22\nnorthern edge of the species\u2019 current range. The effectiveness of corridors is unproven for most\nspecies, but at least trying to minimise large east-west barriers is helpful. For example, the Cheshire\nWildlife Forum suggested that north-south green corridors remained in the Liverpool-Manchester area\nin order to facilitate species movement.\nMuch of the movement will be across managed land and here more environmentally friendly\nmanagement techniques, at least in selected areas, could be helpful e.g. minimising spraying adjacent\nto verges, banks and hedges and leaving small areas of unmanaged land. Policies like Nitrate\nVulnerable Zones (NVZs), and set aside do make a contribution.\nPolicy adaptation issues include:\n\uf0b7 The continuance or expansion of agri-environment schemes, such as Environmentally Sensitive\nAreas (ESAs) and Countryside Stewardship could be helpful in all the habitats, except Arctic-\nAlpine and saltmarshes where it is not directly relevant;\n\uf0b7 The integration of conservation into wider countryside management. This could include buffer\nzones around protected sites and viewing biodiversity as a positive resource;\n\uf0b7 Translocation is an option for consideration where a population is reaching a low level. It is,\nhowever, an uncertain and expensive method of trying to ensure the continuance of a species;\n\uf0b7 Coastal habitats could benefit from managed retreat or a laissez-faire approach;\n\uf0b7 UK nature conservation policy needs to change such that the conservation objectives of\nBiodiversity Action Plans (BAPs) and wider countryside schemes take account of the impacts of\nclimate change (Hossell et al., 2001);\n\uf0b7 The interpretation and implementation of EC nature conservation legislation needs to be\nconsidered in the light of climate change, as this will affect the UK\u2019s ability to meet or sustain\ncurrent obligations. International co-operation will be required to achieve any modification of\nEuropean and international wildlife conservation treaties to account for climate change impacts.\nMuch of the future of biodiversity in these regions will depend on planned adaptation in the other\nsectors investigated.\n4.2 The usefulness and interpretation of model results\nIt is axiomatic of the definition of Integrated assessment (IA) as \u201can interdisciplinary process that\ncombines, interprets, and communicates knowledge from diverse scientific disciplines from the\nnatural and social sciences to investigate and understand causal relationships within and between\n23\ncomplicated systems\u201d (IPCC, 2001) that IA should provide information suitable for decision making\n(Harremoes and Turner, 2001). It is therefore worth reviewing the results from the RegIS study in\nthis light.\nAt a sectoral level, there was a difference in the extent to which the results from the RegIS project\nwere considered by technical \u2018experts\u2019 to be useful within the narrow confines of their sectors \/\nregions. The use of regional analyses in the UK are rare in the case of agriculture and relatively\nuncommon in coastal and biodiversity applications. A regional framework for water resource\nassessment is far better developed and resourced for regulatory purposes. The perceived utility of the\nRegIS results tended to be higher where regional tools and analyses are less common. Furthermore,\nnot all the regional tools and analyses currently used in regional decision-making are available to the\nwider audience of interested stakeholders. Hence, RegIS provides an independent and publicly\navailable source of information to the latter.\nAt the local operational decision-making level, there is a tendency to compare model results either\nagainst local scale knowledge of a location \/ catchment etc or against the data requirements and\nconfidence\/uncertainty needed to make a technical decision. In both cases, it is inevitable that the\nresults of regional studies such as RegIS will not provide the location-specific information to match\nthese technical needs. For example, decisions on future coastal flood defence or water supply\nmanagement require more detailed, site specific investigations. However, this is less true of the\nbiodiversity sector, where the results were seen as being indicative of species at risk and were\nconsistent with those from the national MONARCH study (Harrison et al., 2001).\nWhere the results of the RegIS project were useful to a non scientific audience was in the field of\npublic engagement with science. The results from RegIS were presented at a wide range of non-\ntechnical events in the UK and widely circulated following the production and publication of a\ncolourful \u2018plain English\u2019 summary report (Holman et al., 2001). It is considered by the RegIS Team\nthat the presentation of the results tended to engender lively discussion for a number of reasons:\n\uf0b7 It was the first time that the implications of the inter-connectedness of the environment on\nclimate change impacts was demonstrated and explored. Many non-technical stakeholders\nhave an innate understanding that the environment is not divided into a series of isolated\ncompartments, but that they are linked with the potential for knock-on effects to occur;\n\uf0b7 The scale of the assessment gave the confidence to stakeholders to debate, or even challenge,\nthe results. The ability to locate their own area in the project\u2019s output allowed some people to\nstand up and disagree with the results or the interpretation. This was seen by the project team\nas a positive outcome, as the results merely represented possible futures rather than probable\noutcomes. It can be easy for people to passively accept the outcome of any study, but to\n24\nactively engage (even if it is to express disagreement) represents a step forward. The next\nstep should be to translate that initial engagement into an improvement in the manner in\nwhich the IA represents their system;\n\uf0b7 Previous climate change studies have tended to focus on the effects of climate change in\nisolation. The explicit recognition given to the socio-economic scenarios in RegIS\ndemonstrated that we are not on a defined \u2018conveyor belt\u2019 to the future but that society has the\npotential to shape the future, through adaptation and mitigation. That society is not\ninexorably progressing towards a preordained future, but still maintains an element of self\ndirection and management was a powerful message.\nThe significant uncertainties and limitations to knowledge present in this first regional IA meant that\nresults of the detail, specificity and confidence that decision-makers require could not be provided.\nWith further investment and refinement, regional IA\u2019s should increasingly provide such output,\nthough even the present IA modelling does provide useful understanding of potential interactions\nbetween sectors which should be used in informing regional policymaking. The above elements of\npublic engagement are considered one of the major real benefits of RegIS, but it is clear that RegIS\nalso has value for the increased understanding that future regional studies should seek to advance.\nSubsequently to the completion of the RegIS project, results have found application in several high\nlevel processes, such as the Foresight Assessment of Flood and Coastal Defence over the next 30 to\n100 years (Watkinson et al., 2003).\n5 Conclusions\nThe \u2018Regional Climate Change Impact and Response Studies in East Anglia and North West\nEngland\u2019 (RegIS) is the first regional integrated assessment study in the UK. It demonstrated that the\nmajor sectors driving landscape change (agriculture, biodiversity, coasts and floodplains and water\nresources) will be differentially impacted by climate and socio-economic change. The study showed\nthat climate change, without adaptation, could lead to severe flood impacts in East Anglia, and\nsignificant agricultural abandonment. Despite yield changes, cropping is generally insensitive to\nclimate, but very sensitive to socio-economic change. There is increased seasonality to river flows,\ncompounded by increased urbanisation and irrigation demand. The species modelling showed the\nindividual nature of species\u2019 response to climate change. Those on their northern range margins could\nexpand and those on their southern margin retreat and possibly be lost from the chosen regions. The\nability of species to respond is also dependent on changes in the other sectors and this may be an\noverriding influence, particularly in the short-term..\n25\nThe significant uncertainties and limitations to knowledge associated with this first regional IA have\nlimitted the direct use of its output in specific regional decision and policy making, though the results\nhave provided an independent \u2018sounding board\u2019 against which decision-makers could compare their\nown results in those sectors where regional analyses are less common. The scientific community\nshould seek to exploit the outputs of such studies to engender public engagement with the global\nchange sphere, whilst at the same time utilising the increased system understanding which has been\ndeveloped to further the field of regional IA.\n6 Acknowledgements\nRegIS was funded by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Project No. CC0337)\nand the UK Water Industries Research within the UK Climate Impacts Programme.

Existing saltmarshes will\ndecline, with the largest declines in Suffolk, although these losses may be replaced\nif low-value coastal areas are abandoned due to frequent flooding (i.e. unplanned\nabandonment). Significant areas of coastal grazing marsh and related freshwater\nhabitats will decline or be lost, depending on the response to flooding.\nAgriculture A reduction in the area of land available for agriculture because of flood risks and\nexpanding urban areas, an increase in the productivity of crops, especially sugar\nbeet and potatoes (but associated with a greater need for irrigation) and\nspecialisation in cereals and root crops arising from economic change. Farmers\nwill be successful in adapting to this future provided adequate water resources are\nallocated.\nWater resources Significantly decreased water resources (both surface and groundwater),\nespecially in Suffolk and Cambridgeshire which is compounded by potentially\nincreased domestic and agricultural demand for water, increased risks of winter\nflooding and summer saline incursion in downstream and coastal catchments, and\nsignificant changes in the spatial nitrate-N concentrations.\nBiodiversity The loss of species that are sensitive to moisture, although increased river flood\nrisk in the Fens could represent opportunities for wet heath re-creation, and lead to\nthe expansion of grazing marsh. Management issues, however, are critical here\nand a net overall loss for the region is thought to be likely.\nTable 2: A picture of a plausible East Anglian future for the 2050s under the Low climate change\nscenario and the Global Sustainability socio-economic scenario\nCoasts Increased flood risk that will be minimised by appropriate planning, including\navoiding development in flood plains. Widespread managed realignment leading\nto a large expansion in saltmarsh and related intertidal habitats, which has\nadditional flood-control benefits. However, this will produce a decline in coastal\ngrazing marsh and related freshwater habitats. Replacement habitats will be\n34\nencouraged in more sustainable inland locations, but the full implications of this\nchange are not currently understood.\nAgriculture An agricultural sector with increasing productivity of sugar beet and potatoes, and\na greater need for irrigation, with more break crops arising from the economic\nchange. Farmers will be successful in adapting to this future provided adequate\nwater resources are available.\nWater resources Slightly decreased water resources (both surface and groundwater), slightly\nincreased seasonality in river flows (lower in the summer, higher in the winter\nespecially in coastal catchments) and slightly improved water quality with respect\nto nitrate-N concentration\nBiodiversity Fairly stable biodiversity with only small habitat changes, with the exception of\nsalt marsh and coastal grazing marsh, where managed realignment could lead to\nsignificant habitat gains and losses, respectively.\nTable 3: A picture of a plausible North West for the 2050s under the High climate change scenario\nand the Regional Enterprise socio-economic scenario\nCoasts A significant increase in the extent and impacts of flooding: significant areas of\n21st Century developments are in the flood plain and hence exposed to these\nproblems. Existing saltmarshes are stable at the regional scale, although there are\nlikely to be localised gains and losses. Significant areas of low-lying, low-value\ncoast will be flooded more than once per year. This suggests that these areas will\nbe abandoned leading to unplanned saltmarsh gains. These areas contain coastal\ngrazing marsh and related freshwater habitats which will decline or be lost,\ndepending on the human response to the flooding.\nAgriculture An agricultural sector with increasing areas under sugar beet and potatoes that\nhave little need of irrigation, but which will require suitable market outlets, and a\nchange from grassland to arable arising from the reduced competitiveness of dairy\nfarming due to the economic scenario, but also due to the increased availability of\narable options arising from climate change. Even in the uplands, the arable area\n35\nmay increase from 8% to 18%.\nWater resources Slightly increased surface water resources, but increased seasonality in river flows\n(lower in the summer, higher in the winter) which is compounded by an increased\npopulation and potentially higher domestic water demand, especially in the south\nof the region and in parts of Cumbria.\nBiodiversity A loss of biodiversity because of the sensitivity to climate change of Arctic-Alpine\nhabitat and other species with a northern distribution, although this loss will be\nbalanced by species migrating northwards or to higher altitudes. Upland hay\nmeadows, however, will be under increasing pressure from agriculture, and bogs\nin the southern part of the region may experience lower water availability,\nalthough salt marshes will not be adversely affected.\nTable 4: A picture of a plausible North West future for the 2050s under the Low climate change\nscenario and the Global Sustainability socio-economic scenario\nCoasts An increasing flood risk, which is minimised by appropriate planning, including\navoidance of development in flood plains. There will be managed realignment\nalong the coasts, leading to a large expansion in saltmarsh and related intertidal\nhabitats at the expense of coastal grazing marsh and related freshwater habitats.\nThe full implications of this change are not currently understood, including what\nmight be required in terms of replacement habitat.\nAgriculture An agricultural sector with a large reduction in the area of permanent grass, which\nbecomes arable cropping (5% arable land use becomes 17%). The profitability of\nbreak crops relative to cereals, however, means that the increased arable area is\ntaken-up by peas, beans, rape, sugar beet and linseed. The sugar beet has little\nneed of irrigation, but will require suitable market outlets. As a proportion of the\ntotal arable area, there is a considerable reduction in cereals but the proportion of\nwheat, which is now the most profitable cereal crop, is largely unchanged. In the\nupland areas 8% arable becomes 24% arable.\nWater resources Little change in water resources, with the exception of the southern part of the\nregion and the northern fringe of the Lake District where there will be slight\ndecreases and slightly improved surface water quality with respect to nitrate-N\n36\nconcentration.\nBiodiversity A loss of biodiversity because of the sensitivity to climate change of Arctic-Alpine\nhabitat and other species with a northern distribution, although this loss will be\nbalanced by species migrating northwards or to higher altitudes. On the whole,\nbiodiversity will prosper with favourable conditions for upland hay meadows,\nbogs and, particularly, salt marshes.\nTable 5: Relative sea-level rise scenarios (cm) referenced to the base year of 1990 (adapted from\nHulme and Jenkins, 1998).\nScenario North\nWest\nEast\nAnglia\nLow 09 16\nHigh 64 71\nTable 6: Regional averages of return periods calculated for the present 100-year event.\nEast Anglia North WestGlobal sea-level\nrise scenario Average (years) Range (years) Average (years) Range (years)\n2050s Low 72 64 - 78 68 63 - 71\n2050s High 5 2 - 8 6 3 - 8\nTable 7: Order of magnitude effects of the scenarios on average annual damages to properties in the\nNorth West and Anglian Regions of the Environment Agency (based on Halcrow Maritine et al.,\n2000) under the Low and High climate change scenarios for the 2050s both with and without changes\nin future socio-economic conditions.
