Existing research has been focused on either outsourcing both\npreventive maintenance (PM) and corrective maintenance (CM) or outsourcing CM only.\nLittle attention, however, has been paid to the problem of outsourcing PM, which is discussed\nin this paper.\n1 email: shaomin.wu@cranfield.ac.uk. Telephone: 0044 1234 754963.\n18 January 2012\n1.1 Prior work\nIn the literature, the types of maintenance outsourcing that have been studied so far in-\nclude: Type-1 outsourcing: outsourcing both CM and PM[1\u20139], and Type-2 outsourcing:\noutsourcing CM[10\u201313] only.\nType-1 outsourcing: both CM and PM are outsourced. PM policies in the context\nof outsourcing both PM and CM have been discussed by a number of authors (see [1\u20136], for\nexample). [7,8] use incentive contracts to induce the contractor to select the maintenance\npolicy that optimises the total profit of the manufacturer and the contractor. In addition\nto the consideration of CM and PM, [9] considers inspection policies and optimises the\ncontract parameter under different scenarios.\nType-2 outsourcing: Only CM is outsourced. Assuming that a sequence of CM con-\ntracts will be made to maintain a piece of equipment and that the service market can\nprovide different kinds of CM contracts to the equipment owner 2 , [10,11] propose meth-\nods for determining the optimal series of CM contracts for the equipment\u2019s lifetime. [12,13]\npresent decision models for selecting CM contracts based on multi-criteria decision making\ntheory, taking into account different variables such as cost and downtime.\nExisting work can be categorised with Table 1.\nHere: Table 1\n1.2 Problems\nIn practice, however, there is a possibility that only PM is outsourced but CM is conducted\nin house. This has been reported from time to time, for example, in [14] where a case about\noutsourcing PM on power cables is presented.\nWhen outsourcing PM, one might consider the following two options:\nOption 1: PM on a piece of equipment will be outsourced to one agent within the lifecyle\nof the equipment;\n2 In this paper, we call the provider of maintenance service as an agent, and the recipient of the\nmaintenance service as an equipment owner.\n2\nOption 2: PM on a piece of equipment will be outsourced to a number of agents within\nthe lifecyle of the equipment and the quality of PM actions conducted within a contract\nperiod can be different.\nRemarks on Option 2. Most companies periodically review (common periodicity is 3-5\nyears) their maintenance procedures, and make contracts with agents within these periods.\nThe maintenance levels can be different from period to period [15]. If we assume that a\nPM contract starts from a PM action and ends with a PM, there can exist a time interval\nbetween two adjacent contracts. Hence, this option will have a time line containing a series\nevents such as (also see Figure 1): a new piece of equipment to start\u2192 \u03c40 \u2192 T1 \u2192 \u03c41 \u2192\nT2 \u2192 \u03c42 \u2192 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2192 \u03c4N\u22121 \u2192 TN \u2192 \u03c4N \u2192 replacement , where \u03c4k (k = 0, 1, 2, ...) is the\ntime interval between the end of the k-th contract and the start of the (k + 1)-th contract,\nand Tk represents the length of the kth contract. Within different Tk, different agents are\ncontracted to undertake PM. Any failures between PM actions are rectified by the equipment\nowner himself, but a penalty might be incurred on the failures to the agents. The quality\nof the last PM conducted by an agent in his contract period can be vitally important, as it\ncan affect the remaining life of the equipment being maintained and therefore the optimum\nchoice of maintenance schedules within its subsequent periods. That is, a piece of equipment\nmaintained with good quality of the last PM conducted in a contract period might need\nfewer PM actions within its remaining lifetime and also fewer failures might occur, whereas\na piece of equipment maintained with poor PM quality within a contract period might need\nmore PM actions within its remaining lifetime and more failures might occur. Hence, good\nquality of the last PM in each contract period can be regarded as a profit to the owner as\nhe will pay less on maintenance within the remaining lifetime of the equipment. In such a\ncase, the owner of the equipment might be willing to pay a bonus to agents for encouraging\ngood PM quality.\nAs one can see in the following sections, mathematically, Option 1 is a special case of Option\n2. Hence, this paper will only discuss Option 2.\nHere: Fig 1\nCompared to the first three variables listed in Table 1, Option 2 differs from existing research\nin the following respects:\nType of outsourcing: Only PM is outsourced;\n3\nType of penalty: Different penalty schemes can be used.\n\u2022 The quality of the last PM will be assessed and a bonus might be paid for good quality.\n\u2022 Penalty for repair not being carried out within specified time limits is not applicable\nhere, as the agent does not undertake any CM upon equipment failures.\nDecision variables: The objective is to seek the optimum series of PM contracts with\nrespect to the length Ti of a contract, the time interval \u03c4i between two adjacent contracts,\nPenalty-2 and bonus schemes.\nHence, if a series of agents are contracted with the equipment owner, it is possible to introduce\na new penalty scheme in following:\n\u2022 failures between PMs can incur Penalty-2 to the agents due to the reliability performance\nspecified in the maintenance contract being violated; and\n\u2022 a bonus can be offered to the agent if the quality of the last PM in a contract is good.\nIt should be noted that [7,8] have already used the concept of bonus functions to encourage\ngood maintenance quality in the context of maintenance outsourcing. In [7,8], however, both\nPM and CM are outsourced, which makes it different from the cases discussed in this paper.\nThis paper discusses PM policies used in Option 2. The equipment owner outsources PM\nwithin fixed periods, in which periodic or sequential PM\u2019s might be conducted. He might\npay a bonus to agents for their good PM quality. The paper investigates the roles of the\nparameters in a typical PM model, proposes approaches to defining the bonus functions,\nderives algorithms to optimise the expected lifecycle cost rate, and discusses special cases of\nboth the PM policy and the bonus function.\nThe paper considers optimising policies from a perspective of the equipment owner and\nassumes that costs on CM, PM, and replacement, and the levels of PM are known. This\nassumption might be rigorous for some cases as some values such as the levels of PM might\nonly be determined by the agents, and unknown to the equipment owner. However, from\na perspective of the equipment owner, he needs to assess the optimum values, including\ncontract length, time intervals between adjacent contracts, penalty and bonus, respectively.\nHence, such assumptions are necessary.\nThe rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents notation and assumptions.\nSection 3 derives the lifecycle cost rate, investigates the roles of the parameters in a typical\n4\nPM model, proposes approaches to defining the bonus on PM actions, derives an algorithm\nto search the optimal solution, and compares two special PM policies. Section 4 presents data\nexamples to look into the validity of the proposed models. Section 5 concludes the findings.\n2 Notation and Assumptions\n2.1 Notation\nHere: Table 2\n2.2 Assumptions\nA typical lifecycle of the equipment under study is shown in Fig 1. Suppose the following\nassumptions hold.\nA.1 The planning horizon is infinite.\nA.2 The failure intensity function, h0,0(t), of the equipment before any maintenance inter-\nvention is conducted is continuous and strictly increasing.\nA.3 The lifecycle of the equipment is defined as the time interval between two adjacent re-\nplacements. That is, the time in a lifecycle progresses as: a new piece of equipment to start \u2192\n\u03c40 \u2192 T1 \u2192 \u03c41 \u2192 T2 \u2192 \u03c42 \u2192 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2192 \u03c4N\u22121 \u2192 TN \u2192 \u03c4N \u2192 replacement . Tk is called a the\nk-th contract period. For simplicity, we assume that Tk = T in this paper.\nA.4 Within the k-th contract period, mk PM actions are conducted at time points (k\u22121)T+\u2211k\u22121\ni=0 \u03c4i + tk,1, (k\u2212 1)T +\n\u2211k\u22121\ni=0 \u03c4i + tk,1 + tk,2, ..., (k\u2212 1)T +\n\u2211k\u22121\ni=0 \u03c4i +\n\u2211mk\ni=1 tk,i, respectively,\nwhere k = 1, ..., N .\nA.5 The quality of the last PM in the k-th contract period might be different from the first\n(mk \u2212 1)th PM\u2019s in the same period 3 .\nA.6 Repair between PM actions is assumed to be minimal repair. A replacement is carried\nout at the end of a lifecycle. The equipment used in the replacement is a new, identical\n3 This assumption holds as only the maintenance quality of the last PM in each contract period\nwill affect the reliability of the equipment in its subsequent time periods, and moreover, the case\nthat PM\u2019s have the same quality within a contract period is a special case of this assumption.\n5\nitem.\nA.7 The time on any PM, minimal repair, and replacement are negligible.\n3 Model formulation and analysis\n3.1 Option 1\nIn Option 1, PM is outsourced to one agent.\n3.2 Option 2\nIn Option 2, a series of PM contracts are outsourced to different agents. In this case, the\nequipment owner might be interested in optimising the following parameters:\n\u2022 time lengths including T and \u03c4i, where i = 0, 1, 2, ...;\n\u2022 value of Penalty-2 and bonus value.\nFollowing the above assumptions, we can derive the expected lifecycle cost rate as follows\nC(N, T, \u03c40, ..., \u03c4N , t1,1, ..., tN,mN ) =\nG(N, T, \u03c40, ..., \u03c4N , t1,1, ..., tN,mN )\nN\u2211\nk=0\n\u03c4k +NT\n, (1)\nsubject to\nmk\u22121\u2211\ni=1\ntk,i = T, (2)\nwhere\nG(N, T, \u03c40, ..., \u03c4N , t1,1, ..., tN,mN )\n= co,1\n\u222b \u03c40\n0\nh0,0(t)dt+\nN\u2211\nk=1\n[\ncc,k\nmk\u22121\u2211\ni=1\n\u222b tk,i\n0\nhk,i(t)dt+ co,k\n\u222b \u03c4k\n0\nhk,mk(t)dt+ ck\n]\n+\nN\u2211\nk=1\nQk(hk,mk(\u03c4k)) + cr, (3)\nk = 1, 2, ..., N , and mk > 2.\nIn Eq. (1),\n\u2211N\nk=0 \u03c4k +NT is the expected time length of a lifecycle. In Eq. (3),\n6\n\u2022 co,1 \u222b \u03c400 h0,0(t)dt is the expected cost on failures within time interval (0, \u03c40),\n\u2022 cc,k\nmk\u22121\u2211\ni=1\n\u222b tk,i\n0\nhk,i(t)dt is the expected cost on failures within time interval ((k \u2212 1)T +\u2211k\u22121\ni=0 \u03c4i +\n\u2211i\u22121\nj=1 tk,j, (k \u2212 1)T +\n\u2211k\u22121\ni=0 \u03c4i +\n\u2211i\nj=1 tk,j), where k \u2265 1;\n\u2022 co,k \u222b \u03c4k0 hk,mk(t)dt is the expected cost on failures within time interval (kT +\u2211k\u22121i=0 \u03c4i, kT +\u2211k\u22121\ni=0 \u03c4i + \u03c4k);\n\u2022 Qk(hk,mk(\u03c4k)) is the bonus on the last PM in the k-th contract period, and\n\u2022 ck is the cost paid for the k-th contract,\n\u2022 cr is the replacement cost in a lifecycle.\nQk(hk,mk(\u03c4k)) is the bonus paid to the k-th agent who is responsible for the last PM in the\nk-th contract period, which considers PM quality that can affect PM frequency needed in its\nsubsequent contract period(s). This makes Eq. (1) different from the problem of traditional\nPM policy optimisation (see [16\u201319], for example), in which the quality of the last PM has\nnot been distinguished. Further discussion on Qk(hk,mk(\u03c4k)) will be carried out in Sections\n3.3.\nIn Eq. (1), the equipment owner needs to optimise N, tk,i and \u03c4k. He might also need to choose\nthe bonus function Qk(hk,mk(\u03c4k)). But before doing so, the bonus function Qk(hk,mk(\u03c4k))\nneeds to be discussed.\n3.3 The bonus function\nIn the section, we discuss the choice of the bonus function Qk(hk,mk(\u03c4k)).\n3.3.1 PM models\nIn Eq. (1), defining the function Qk(hk,mk(\u03c4k)) is important. hk,mk(\u03c4k) usually defines a PM\nmodel. In the reliability literature, PM models are introduced to assess PM quality (see\n[20,21], or Eq. (4) in the following, for example). The parameters in a PM model play\nimportant roles in measuring PM quality. In this section, we analyse the roles of those\nparameters, then in the following section we define the bonus function Qk(hk,mk(\u03c4k)).\nPM models are developed based on adjusting either the failure intensity function of a piece\nof equipment or its age. After a maintenance action is carried out on a, the failure intensity\n7\nof the equipment is assumed to change from hk,i\u22121(t) to hk,i(t). If we assume that the quality\nof the first (mk \u2212 1)th PM actions in the k-th contract period are identical and the quality\nof the last PM is different, a typical case of hk,i(t) associated with hk,i\u22121(t) given by [20] is\nhk,i(t) = ak,ihk,i\u22121(\u03c6k,it+ \u03c8k,i) + bk,i, (4)\nwhere ak,i(>)0, \u03c6k,i(> 0), bk,i and \u03c8k,i are parameters.\nIf we consider Assumption (A.5), we have\n\u2022 if 1 \u2264 i \u2264 mk \u2212 1, then let ak,i = a\u2032k,0, bk,i = b\u2032k,0, \u03c6k,i = \u03c6\u2032k,0, and \u03c8k,i = \u03c8\u2032k,0;\n\u2022 if i = mk, then let ak,mk = a\u2032k,1, bk,mk = b\u2032k,1, \u03c6k,mk = \u03c6\u2032k,1, and \u03c8k,mk = \u03c8\u2032k,1.\nThen, Eq. (4) can also be re-written as\nhk,i(t) = Akih0,0(\u03a6kit+ \u03a8ki) +Bki, (5)\nwhere A00 = 1,\u03a600 = 1,\u03a800 = 0, B00 = 0, m0 = 0, for k \u2265 1,\nAk,i =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\na0kAk\u22121,mk\u22121 if i = 1\na0kAk,i\u22121 if 2 \u2264 i \u2264 mk \u2212 1,\na1kAk,i\u22121 if i = mk\n\u03a6k,i =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\n\u03c60k\u03a6k\u22121,mk\u22121 if i = 1\n\u03c60k\u03a6k,i\u22121 if 2 \u2264 mk \u2212 1,\n\u03c61k\u03a6k,i\u22121 if i = mk\n\u03a8k,i =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\n\u03c60k\u03a8k\u22121,mk\u22121 + \u03c80k if i = 1\n\u03c60k\u03a8k,i\u22121 + \u03c80k if 2 \u2264 mk \u2212 1,\n\u03c61k\u03a8k,i\u22121 + \u03c81k if i = mk\nand Bk,i =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\na0kBk\u22121,mk\u22121 + b0k if i = 1\na0kBk,i\u22121 + b0k if 2 \u2264 mk \u2212 1.\na1kBk,i\u22121 + b1k if i = mk\nThe PM model shown in Eq. (4) can be seen as an extension of a wide spectrum of PM\nmodels such as those introduced in [21\u201323], etc.\nEstimating the parameters in the bonus function as shown in Eq. (4) is vital. In practise,\nfor example, we might estimate the parameters in Eq. (4) based on data collected from\nthe equipment owner who might have a large number of pieces equipment of the same\ntype maintained and have enough field data, or based on expert elicitation to estimate the\nparameters.\n8\nA simpler situation might be to count the number of failures within the time period \u03c4k to\nassess the quality of the last PM conducted by an agent.\n3.3.2 Some bonus functions\nFrom Eq. (4), we have\n\u2022 Assume hk,i\u22121(\u03c6k,it+ \u03c8k,i) is smaller than 1. Then we have \u2202hk,i(t)\u2202ak,i = hk,i\u22121(\u03c6k,it+ \u03c8k,i) \u2264\n\u2202hk,i(t)\n\u2202bk,i\n= 1, which implies that an improvement in bk,i can affect hk,i\u22121(\u03c6k,it + \u03c8k,i) more\neffectively than ak,i can; and\n\u2022 As hk,i\u22121(\u03c6k,it+\u03c8k,i) is an increasing function, h\u2032k,i\u22121(\u03c6k,it+\u03c8k,i) > 0. If t > 1, then \u2202hk,i(t)\u2202\u03c6k,i =\nh\n\u2032\nk,i\u22121(\u03c6k,it + \u03c8k,i)t >\n\u2202hk,i(t)\n\u2202\u03c8k,i\n= h\n\u2032\nk,i\u22121(\u03c6k,it + \u03c8k,i), which implies that an improvement in\n\u03c6k,i can affect hk,i\u22121(\u03c6k,it+ \u03c8k,i) more effectively than \u03c8k,i can.\nRemark. The above two bulleted points show that \u03c6k,i and bk,i in Eq. (4) can play more\nimportant roles than parameters ak,i and \u03c8k,i.\nFrom the above discussion, we can define Qk(hk,mk(\u03c4k)), if we assume that it only depends\non the parameters, ak,i, bk,i, \u03c6k,i, and \u03c8k,i, in Eq. (4). It might be reasonable to assume that\nQk(hk,mk(\u03c4k)) is in inverse proportion to the values ak,i and \u03c6k,i, and in direct proportion to\nthe values \u03c8k,i and bk,i. For example, if PM only changes the parameter ak,i in Eq. (4), then\none might estimate the bonus using the following equation.\nQk(hk,mk(\u03c4k)) =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\nexp(\u2212\u03b81ak,i) if ak,i < 1\n0 otherwise,\n(6)\nwhere \u03b81 is a positive parameter.\nak,i, bk,i, \u03c6k,i, and \u03c8k,i play different roles, according to the above remark, which should be\nnoted when we define\/estimate the parameter \u03b81.\nWe might also consider the following scenarios on the relationship between Qk(hk,mk(\u03c4k))\nand the mkth PM in the k-th contract period.\n\u2022 NoF (number of failures) based approach. Qk(.) is a function of \u222b x0 hk\u22121,mk\u22121(t|\u03c4k\u22121 +T )dt\u2212\u222b x\n0 hk,mk(t)dt:\n\u222b x\n0 hk,mk\u22121(t|\u03c4k\u22121 + T )dt is the number of failures of the equipment within\nthe next x time units, given that the equipment has survived \u03c4k\u22121 +T time units after the\n9\nlast PM in the (k \u2212 1)-th contract period; \u222b x0 hk,mk(t)dt is the number of failures of the\nequipment within a given time, (0, x) say, after the last PM in the k-th contract period.\nQk(hk,mk(\u03c4k))\n=\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\ne\u03b82(\n\u222b x\n0\nhk\u22121,mk\u22121 (t|\u03c4k\u22121+T )dt\u2212\n\u222b x\n0\nhk,mk (t)dt) if\n\u222b x\n0 hk\u22121,mk\u22121(t|\u03c4k\u22121 + T )dt >\n\u222b x\n0 hk,mk(t)dt\n0 otherwise.\n(7)\nwhere \u03b82 is a positive parameter.\nUsing this bonus function, we aim to measure the reduction of the number of failures\nafter the last PM is conducted in the k-th contract period.\n\u2022 Remaining life based approach.Qk(.) might also be defined as a function of \u222b\u221e0 udFk,mk(u)\u2212\u222b\u221e\n0 udFk\u22121,mk\u22121(u|\u03c4k\u22121 +T ):\n\u222b\u221e\n0 udFk,mk(u) is the expected life of the equipment just after\nthe last PM in the k-th contract period, and\n\u222b\u221e\n0 udFk\u22121,mk\u22121(u|\u03c4k\u22121 + T ) is the remaining\nlife of the equipment, given that it has survived for \u03c4k\u22121 + T time units since the last PM\nin the (k \u2212 1)-th contract period. For example, one might define that\nQk(hk,mk(\u03c4k))\n=\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\ne\u03b83(\n\u222b\u221e\n0\nudFk,mk (u)\u2212\n\u222b\u221e\n0\nudFk\u22121,mk\u22121 (u|\u03c4k\u22121+T )) if\n\u222b\u221e\n0 udFk,mk(u) >\n\u222b\u221e\n0 udFk\u22121,mk\u22121(u|\u03c4k\u22121 + T )\n0 otherwise,\n(8)\nwhere \u03b83 is a positive parameter.\nUsing this approach will encourage the (k \u2212 1)-th maintenance company to conduct\nbetter maintenance to prolong the time length before the k-th company is contracted.\n3.4 Maintenance policies\nWe assume that hk,i(\u2022) is defined by Eq. (4), and Qk(hk,mk(\u03c4k) is defined by Eq. (6). To find\nthe optimal solution that minimises C(N, \u03c40, \u03c41, ..., \u03c4N , t1,1, ..., tN,mN ), we can set the partial\nderivatives of C(N, \u03c40, \u03c41, ..., \u03c4N , t1,1, ..., tN,mN ) with respect to \u03c40, \u03c41, ..., \u03c4N , t1,1, ..., tN,mN to 0,\nrespectively, which gives\nco,1h0,0(\u03c40)\n( N\u2211\nk=0\n\u03c4k +NT\n)\n= G(N, T, \u03c40, \u03c41, ..., \u03c4N , t1,1, ..., tN,mN ), (9)\n10\n(\nco,kAk,mkh0,0(\u03a6k,mk\u03c4k + \u03a8k,mk) +\n\u2202Qk(hk,mk(\u03c4k))\n\u2202\u03c4k\n)( N\u2211\nk=0\n\u03c4k +NT\n)\n(10)\n= G(N, T, \u03c40, \u03c41, ..., \u03c4N , t1,1, ..., tN,mN ),\nand\ncc,kAk,ih0,0(\u03a6k,itk,i + \u03a8k,i)\u2212 cc,kAk,mkh0,0(\u03a6k,mk(T \u2212\nmk\u22121\u2211\ni=1\ntk,i) (11)\n+\u03a8k,mk) +\n\u2202Qk(hk,mk(\u03c4k))\n\u2202tk,i\n= 0.\nFor generality, we have not replaced\n\u2202Qk(hk,mk (\u03c4k))\n\u2202tk,i\nwith the one in Eq. (6).\nFrom equations (9) and (11), we have\nco,kAk,mkh0,0(\u03a6k,mk\u03c4k + \u03a8k,mk) +\n\u2202Qk(hk,mk(\u03c4k))\n\u2202\u03c4k\n= co,1h0,0(\u03c40). (12)\nThe computing procedure to obtain an optimal schedule can be specified as follows: let\nN be fixed, then obtain the solutions based on the following steps, after that compare\nC(N, T, \u03c40, \u03c41, ..., \u03c4N , t1,1, ..., tN,mN ) on the solutions, and then choose those solutions with\nthe minimal\nWe can specify the computing procedure to obtain an optimal schedule as follows: we can\nfix N , then obtain the solutions based on the following steps, then compare\nC(N, T, \u03c40, \u03c41, ..., \u03c4N , t1,1, ..., tN,mN ) on the solutions, and then choose those solutions with the\nminimalG3(N, T, \u03c40, \u03c41, ..., \u03c4N , t1,1, ..., tN,mN ). In the following algorithm, we assumeQk(hk,mk(\u03c4k))\nis simply related to \u03c4k (k = 1, 2, ..., N).\n\u2022 Let N = 1, 2, 3, ..., n, where n is a given upper limit;\n\u2022 Solve Eq. (12), and express \u03c4k (k = 0, ..., N) by a function of \u03c40;\n\u2022 Solve Eq. (12) with respect to tk,i;\n\u2022 Substitute \u03c4k and tk,i into Eq. (9) to obtain \u03c40;\n\u2022 Substitute \u03c40 into Eq. (12) to obtain \u03c4k; and\n\u2022 determine N which minimises Eq. (1).\nThe above algorithm has simplified the optimisation problem of a complex mixed integer\nprogramming to the optimisation problem of an integer programming.\nThe above algorithm only considers to optimise the frequency of the PM. Similarly, we can\n11\nalso optimise the bonus function and penalty costs in each contract periods: he can find the\noptimum parameters through minimising the expected cost in Eq. (1).\n3.4.1 Special cases of the PM policy\nPM can be conducted either periodically or sequentially. The periodic PM policy is more\nfrequently used due to its simplicity in scheduling, and the sequential PM policy is less\nfrequently used. An interesting PM policy in Option 2 might be a hybrid of the periodic PM\npolicy and the sequential PM policy. In this section, the following two special maintenance\npolicies are investigated (see Figure 1).\n\u2022 Periodic\u2013sequential (PS) PM policy. Within a given time period T , periodic PM is per-\nformed, but the values \u03c4k are unequal for k = 1, 2, ..., ie., tk,1 = tk,2 = ... = tk,mk and\n\u03c41 6= \u03c42 6= ..., 6= \u03c4N . The quality of PM\u2019s within a time period T are the same but are dif-\nferent among different time periods T \u2019s. Denote CPS = C(N, T, \u03c40, \u03c41, ..., \u03c4N , t1,1, ..., tN,mN )\nas the expected lifecycle cost rate of this case.\n\u2022 Sequential\u2013periodic (SP) PM policy. Within a given time period T , sequential PM is\nperformed. The values \u03c4k are equal for k = 1, 2, ..., ie, tk,1 6= tk,2 6= ... 6= tk,mk and\n\u03c41 = \u03c42 = ...,= \u03c4N . The quality of PM\u2019s within a time period T are the same but are dif-\nferent among different time periods T \u2019s. Denote CSP = C(N, T, \u03c40, \u03c41, ..., \u03c4N , t1,1, ..., tN,mN )\nas the expected lifecycle cost rate of this case.\nAn interesting question is which PM policy, periodic\u2013sequential PM policy or sequential-\nperiodic PM policy, is better regarding the expected cost rate. The following two Lemmas\nlist sufficient conditions for comparing the two policies.\nLemma 1 Denote \u03c4 =\n1\nN + 1\nN\u2211\nk=0\n\u03c4k, and assume that \u03c40 \u2265 \u03c41 \u2265 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2265 \u03c4k0 \u2265 \u03c4 \u2265 \u03c4k0+1 \u2265\n. . . \u03c4N , then\n\u2022\n\u222b \u03c4\n0\nh0,0(t)dt+\nN\u2211\nk=1\n\u222b \u03c4\n0\nhk,mk(t)dt \u2265\n\u222b \u03c40\n0\nh0,0(t)dt+\nN\u2211\nk=1\n\u222b \u03c4k\n0\nhk,mk(t)dt if\nmax{h0,0(\u03c40), h1,m1(\u03c41)..., hk0,mk0 (\u03c4k0)} \u2264 min{hk0+1,mk0+1(\u03c4k0+1), ..., hN,mN (\u03c4N)}.\n\u2022\n\u222b \u03c4\n0\nh0,0(t)dt+\nN\u2211\nk=1\n\u222b \u03c4\n0\nhk,mk(t)dt \u2264\n\u222b \u03c40\n0\nh0,0(t)dt+\nN\u2211\nk=1\n\u222b \u03c4k\n0\nhk,mk(t)dt if\nmin{h0,0(\u03c40), h1,m1(\u03c41)..., hk0,mk0 (\u03c4k0)} \u2265 max{hk0+1,mk0+1(\u03c4k0+1), ..., hN,mN (\u03c4N)}.\n12\nThe proofs for the Lemmas in this paper can be found in Appendix.\nLemma 2 Denote tk,0 =\n1\nmk \u2212 1\nmk\u22121\u2211\ni=1\ntk,i, Qk(hk,mk(\u03c4k)) is measured with Eq.

Then,\n\u2022 CSP > CSP if max{h0,0(\u03c40), h1,m1(\u03c41)..., hk0,mk0 (\u03c4k0)} \u2264 min{hk0+1,mk0+1(\u03c4k0+1), ..., hN,mN (\u03c4N)},\nand\nmin{hk,1(tk,1), ..., hk,ik(tk,ik)} \u2265 max{hk,ik+1(tk,ik+1), ..., hk,mk(tk,mk\u22121)}.\n\u2022 CSP < CSP if max{h0,0(\u03c40), h1,m1(\u03c41)..., hk0,mk0 (\u03c4k0)} \u2265 min{hk0+1,mk0+1(\u03c4k0+1), ..., hN,mN (\u03c4N)},\nand\nmin{hk,1(tk,1), ..., hk,ik(tk,ik)} \u2264 max{hk,ik+1(tk,ik+1), ..., hk,mk(tk,mk\u22121)}.\nLemma 2 gives sufficient conditions for comparing the two PM policies with respect to their\nexpected lifecycle cost rate.\n4 Illustrative examples\nConsider a case where the life distribution of a piece of equipment under consideration is\na 2-parameter Weibull distribution at operating state. The failure intensity is assumed to\nbe h0(t) =\n1\n8\n( t\n24\n)2. That is, its corresponding lifetime distributions is given F (t) = 1 \u2212\nexp{\u2212( t\n24\n)3}. We set N = 3, T = 36, cr = 5000, co,k = cc,k = 100e0.5k, Qk(hk,mk(\u03c4k)) =\n0.1e\n0.8\nak\u22121 . In Eq. (4), without loss of generality, we set ak,i =\nk+5.2\nk+4\n, \u03c6k,i = 1, \u03c8k,i = 0, and\nbk,i = 0.\n4.1 Comparison between the PS and the SP policies\nUsing the above parameters, we obtain the optimal PS and SP policies as shown in Tables 3\nand 4, from which one can find that the two policies reach their optimal values when N = 3.\nHowever, the expected lifecycle cost rate of the SP policy is greater than that of the PS\npolicy.\nFor the optimal policies N = 3, if we further prolong the length of \u03c4 in the SP policy to let\n\u03c4 =\n1\nN + 1\nN\u2211\nk=0\n\u03c4k, we can obtain Table 5, from which one can find that the expected lifecycle\n13\ncost rate of the SP policy (67.12) is more than 1.4 times as big as that of the PS policy\n(47.73).\nHere: Figure 2.\nHere: Table 3\nHere: Table 4\nHere: Table 5\n4.2 Impact of PM quality\nChanging parameter \u2206 in ak,i =\nk+\u2206\nk+4\n, we can investigate the impact of the parameters ak,i\non the expected lifecycle cost rate for the two policies, ie., the PS policy and the SP policy\n( as shown in Table 6). For example, the changes of CPS against \u2206 are shown in Figure 2,\nwhich is a concave curve and the expected long-run cost rate reaches the optimal value when\n\u2206 = 5.2.\nHere: Table 6\n4.3 Impact of CM cost\nNow, we re-set co,k = cc,k = 100e\ncmk. That is, we set N = 3, T = 36, cr = 5000,\nQk(hk,mk(\u03c4k)) = 0.1e\n0.8\nak\u22121 , and ak =\nk+5.2\nk+4\n. We change cm from 0.1 to 1, the expected lifecycle\ncost rate shows a linear relationship with cm, as shown in Table 7.\nHere: Table 7\n5 Conclusions\nThis paper considers providing equipment owners with approaches to benchmarking various\nparameters for the case where PM is outsourced. It investigated the roles of the parameters\nin a PM (PM) model in respect to PM quality, derived an approach to measuring the profit\n14\nof good PM actions, and derived an approach to searching the optimal solutions.\nFuture research includes:\n\u2022 The planning horizon is assumed infinite in this paper. Another consideration that can be\ntaken is the scenario of finite planning horizon.\n\u2022 The contract periods (i.e., T ) in a lifecycle are assumed to be identical in the paper. A\nreasonable extension can be to assume that they are varying.\nAcknowledgements\nI would like to thank Dr Ralf Gitzel for the useful discussion.\nReferences\n[1] J. Jaturonnatee, D. N. P.
