Typically the DFKE is measured by \npump-probe transmission experiments, with a THz pump field and an ultra-short intehand probe. In tlus paper we use \nthe extended semiconductor Bloch equations [2,3] to study the dependence of the DFKE on the phase and intensity of \nthe THz driving field. \nNear the band edge there are two principle THz generated features [4]. The first is a replica of the 2p exciton \nstate, which appears below the bandgap, due to the simultaneous absorption of one THz and one probe photon. The \nsecond is a sideband wluch appears two THz photon energies above the main 1s peak. In this work we investigate the \ndependence of these features on the phase and intensity of the THz field, and discuss the implications for experiment. \nIntuitively, one expects the phase of the THz field to be significant, as its oscillation period ( ~ 5 0 0  fs) is much \nlonger than the 50 fs probe pulse. We show the phase dependence of the absorption spectra in Fig. 1. The sideband \nfeature in the continuum changes shape significantly as the phase vanes. The phase dependence of the below-gap \npeaks is much weaker. \nIn eqeriments, it can be difficult to lock the arrival of the probe pulse to a particular phase of the THz field, and \nif, as is usual, an average over many experimental spectra is taken, then the results should be compared with phase- \naveraged theoretical predctions. We find that the sideband feature is absent in the phase averaged spectra, and thus \nexpect that it will be drfficult to detect in transmission (as opposed to in luminescence [5 ] . )  The position and shape of \nthe below-gap features are hardly affected by phase averaging. \nThe DFKE itself blueshfts all the main features. However, as the 1 s  - 2p transition is dipole-allowed, the 1s \nexciton peak and the 2p replica are also Stark slufted by the THz field. We show an example of the resulting spectra in \nFig. 2 .  In th~s case the THz frequency is tuned below the 1s - 2p transition, so the 1s peak undergoes a Stark redshift \nand the 2p replica a Stark blueshift. Thus at all intensities the 2p replica undergoes a net bluesluft greater than that of \nthe 2s peak, as there is no significant Stark effect on the latter. The 1s peak undergoes a net redshift at low intensities \nwhere the AC Stark effect dominates, which becomes a blueshift at higher intensities as the DFKE shift becomes the \nlarger. \nWe have further computed DFKE spectra in the presence of a finite population of camers. Initial results show a \nstrong bleaching of the 1s sideband and a red sluft of the 2s exciton. \nQThJ2 1 \nI \" \" 1 \" \" I ' \" ' I \" \"  \nIs exciton 2s exciton \nd 20 rmlica I Is sideband \n-10 -5 0 5 10 \nProbe energy (relative to gap, m e w  \nFig. 1.
