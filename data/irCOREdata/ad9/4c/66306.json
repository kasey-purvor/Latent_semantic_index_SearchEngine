INTRODUCTION\nIncreasing the efficiency, reliability, and lifetime of\nCdTe-based solar cells has been a research focus for the last\ntwo decades, and yet the best efficiencies achieved so far are\nstill far below the theoretical limit. In order to reach this\ngoal, surprisingly few of the many approaches have explored\nthe doping of the layers forming the CdTe\/CdS junction,1,2\nand led unfortunately to conflicting reports regarding the ef-\nfect that such doping could have on the performance of the\ndevice.1\u20133\nCdCl2 is widely used for the heat treatment of the\nCdTe\/CdS device structures, and is also often used as source\nmaterial providing Cd for the chemical bath deposition of\nCdS. By using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrom-\netry, we have been able to show that CdCl2 powders supplied\nby different manufacturers with different nominal purities,\nalready contain substantial amounts of various impurities\nthat have a potential doping effect on both CdTe and CdS.4\nWith regard to the impact that the CdCl2 activation process\nhas on CdTe-based solar cells, apparently contradicting re-\nports were published. One found that the Fermi level shifted\nupwards towards the conduction band following CdCl2\ntreatment.5 Another demonstrated that due to an in situ CdCl2\ntreatment, the Fermi level shifts downwards towards the va-\nlence band.6 The latter study also showed that when used in\nsitu, this processing step leads to relatively oxide free surface\ncompared to the widely used ex situ CdCl2 processing.6\nIn the few reports published so far, secondary ion mass\nspectrometry \u0001SIMS\u0002 was mostly dedicated to the investiga-\ntion of back contacts and stability of CdTe\/CdS solar\ncells.7\u201310 We recently reported a detailed SIMS study of\nCdTe\/CdS\/TCO solar cell structures depth profiled through-\nout using quantitative SIMS from the back and the front\nside.11,12 This study exhibited the distribution and concentra-\ntion of trace elements in the solar cell structures and led to an\ninsight into their main sources.\nThis investigation is a study of the behavior of\nCdTe\/CdS solar cell devices following an in situ oxygen\nincorporation in the CdTe absorber layer during its growth.\nWe show that oxygen introduction into CdTe increases the\nperformance of these devices by improving all the solar cell\nparameters. The behavior of impurity species in CdTe and\nCdS layers, with relevance to these devices, was also care-\nfully looked at using quantitative SIMS depth profiling.\nII. EXPERIMENT\nThree samples were considered in this study and are\nsummarized in Table I. Our approach was to use sapphire as\nsubstrate for its stability at the temperature range used in this\na\u0002Present address: Clarendon Laboratory, Department of Physics, University\nof Oxford, Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3PU, United Kingdom; electronic\nmail: m.emziane1@physics.oxford.ac.uk\nTABLE I. Fabrication conditions of the three CdTe\/CdS\/TCO\/sapphire de-\nvices investigated. The effect of oxygen introduction in CdTe is seen for\nprocessed device structures by comparing samples 85 and 89, while com-\nparison of samples 87 and 89 shows the effect of CdCl2 treatment and the\nsubsequent chemical etching when the CdTe layer is grown with oxygen\nincorporated in it.\nSample\nnumber\nIntroduction of O in the CdTe\nlayer during growth\nCdCl2 treatment and subsequent\nBr2-methanol etching\n85 No Yes\n87 Yes No\n89 Yes Yes\nJOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS 100, 013513 \u00012006\u0002\n0021-8979\/2006\/100\u00021\u0001\/013513\/5\/$23.00 \u00a9 2006 American Institute of Physics100, 013513-1\nDownloaded 26 Apr 2011 to 129.234.252.66.

The transparent conducting oxide \u0001TCO\u0002 bilayer\nconsisted of a fluorine doped indium tin oxide \u0001ITO:F\u0002 film\n\u0001\u00051.2 \u0002m thick\u0002 followed by a tin oxide \u0001SnO2\u0002 film of\nabout 300 nm thickness. It was deposited by reactive sput-\ntering at a substrate temperature around 450 \u00b0C, an Ar+O2\natmosphere was used for both layers while CHF3 was added\nin the case of ITO:F. The \u000580-nm-thick CdS:F layer was\nthen deposited by reactive sputtering in a different chamber\nusing Ar and CHF3 flows at a substrate temperature of\n200 \u00b0C and a total pressure of 5\u000110\u22123 mbar. Finally, the\ndeposition of the \u00058-\u0002m-thick CdTe layer was performed\nby close space sublimation \u0001CSS\u0002 where the source tempera-\nture was kept at 750 \u00b0C while the substrate temperature was\nin the range of 480\u2013540 \u00b0C. The distance source substrate\nwas 2\u20133 mm. Oxygen was intentionally introduced in situ\nby letting O2 into the CSS chamber during the deposition of\nthe CdTe layers for two of the devices. The total pressure \u0001Ar\nand O2\u0002 was 100 mbars with 5 mbars O2 partial pressure.\nThe CdTe layer of the remaining device was grown under the\nsame conditions but without oxygen. Two of the samples \u000185\nand 89\u0002 then underwent a CdCl2 processing via thermal\nevaporation of CdCl2 powder on top of the structures and air\nannealing \u0001400 \u00b0C for 30 min\u0002, followed by a chemical etch-\ning in bromine-methanol solution. The purity of the starting\nmaterials used in this study was 6, 4, and 3N for CdTe, CdS,\nand CdCl2, respectively. The sapphire substrates used had 5N\npurity. The back contact consisted of sputtered Sb2Te3 and\nMo layers deposited at 300 \u00b0C and room temperature, re-\nspectively.\nThe devices were investigated using quantitative SIMS\ndepth profiling \u0001Cameca IMS 4f, QinetiQ UK\u0002. O and Cs\nprimary ion beams were rastered over an area of 175 \u0002m\ndiameter to profile Si, In, Cl, Na, O, Sn, F, Br, and S. The\nsecondary ions were collected from the center of the craters\nthrough a circular area of 60 and 33 \u0002m diameter, for O and\nCs, respectively. 5N purity CdTe and CdS single crystals\nwere used to implant the species studied in order to obtain\ntheir relative sensitivity factors \u0001RSFs\u0002 necessary for the\nSIMS quantification, except for F and Br where the RSFs\nwere extrapolated from HgCdTe implants. The RSF values\nused and other conditions of SIMS measurements are sum-\nmarized in Table II. Device characteristics were measured\nunder standard conditions \u0001AM 1.5 and a light power of\n100 mW\/cm2\u0002 in order to determine the device parameters.\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nWe will focus on the effect of oxygen incorporation in\nCdTe combined with the residual contaminants present in\nCdCl2 that are relevant to CdTe-based solar cell devices\nthrough their effect on the optoelectrical properties of CdTe\nand CdS layers of the structures. The quantitative SIMS data\nfor the CdTe and CdS layers will be presented and discussed\nseparately in Secs. III A and III B.\nA. Impurity species in the CdTe absorber layer\nIn this section, the presence and distribution of impuri-\nties in the CdTe layer of the devices will be looked at. For\nthis purpose, all the SIMS data shown in this section were\ncalibrated using exclusively CdTe RSFs, meaning that they\nare quantitative for CdTe but only qualitative for the CdS\nwindow layer.\nFigure 1 shows O and Cl depth profiles throughout the\nstructures of the three samples. The highest oxygen concen-\ntration was found in the CdTe layer when its growth was\nperformed with O2 incorporation. This can be seen in Fig. 1\nby comparing samples 85 and 89, both of which were\nCdCl2-treated. A comparison between samples 87 and 89\nleads also to an interesting conclusion which is that the con-\ncentration of oxygen in CdTe is further increased when the\nsample receives a postgrowth heat treatment in CdCl2\n\u0001sample 89\u0002 as compared to the sample without CdCl2 treat-\nment \u0001sample 87\u0002, although the CdTe layer of both samples\nwas grown in presence of oxygen.\nWith regard to chlorine content in CdTe, it appears that\nthis is about two orders of magnitude higher for\nCdCl2-treated samples \u000185 and 89\u0002 versus the untreated one\n\u000187\u0002. Moreover, for the two treated samples, the Cl concen-\ntration is even higher when the sample already contains oxy-\ngen in CdTe following its introduction during the growth\n\u0001sample 89 versus sample 85\u0002. It turns out therefore that the\nTABLE II.

Bromine shows similar diffusionlike pro-\nfiles for both processed samples \u000185 and 89\u0002 with a steadily\nincreasing concentration from the CdTe\/CdS interface to the\nCdTe surface. This is in contrast with the Br profile from the\nunprocessed sample \u000187\u0002 that is flat throughout CdTe with a\nconcentration of 5\u00011019 cm\u22123, and confirms that Br pres-\nence in CdTe is due to the bromine-methanol chemical etch-\ning performed on the processed samples following the CdCl2\nheat treatment and prior to the back contact deposition. Fluo-\nrine has a constant concentration within the CdTe layer for\nthe processed samples, but in the unprocessed sample the\nprofile is not flat in CdTe, meaning that F profile flattens\nupon heat treatment. The depth profiles shown by indium and\ntin are flat with concentrations in CdTe in the range of 5\n\u00011014\u20131015 cm\u22123 for In and 1014 cm\u22123 for Sn regardless of\nthe sample preparation conditions except for In in sample 89\nwhere some increase is seen at a depth between 3 and 7 \u0002m\nwithin CdTe. Sodium profiles are flat in CdTe for samples 85\nand 89 and more spread out in sample 87 but with concen-\ntrations of 5\u00011016 cm\u22123 for the CdCl2-treated samples \u000185\nand 89\u0002 and only 1015 cm\u22123 for the sample that did not re-\nceive any treatment with CdCl2 \u000187\u0002. This indicates therefore\nthat the increase in Na concentration in CdTe following\nCdCl2 treatment is a direct consequence of the Na already\npresent in the CdCl2 powder used for the treatment, as care-\nfully checked in our separate study.4 This is also corrobo-\nrated by comparing the Na concentration measured in CdTe\nlayer of samples grown on soda-lime glass substrates and\nshows clearly that Na is exclusively due to CdCl2 in this\nparticular case where sapphire substrates were used.11 Within\nthe accuracy of this SIMS analysis, the incorporation of oxy-\ngen in CdTe was not found to have any particular effect on\nthe distribution or concentration of Na, Br, F, In, and Sn.\nSilicon concentration in CdTe decreases from\n\u00051017 cm\u22123 in sample 85 to \u00051016 cm\u22123 in sample 89 to\nbelow \u00051015 cm\u22123 in sample 87, i.e., below the detection\nlimit of the SIMS system used. This suggests that the pres-\nence of oxygen in CdTe \u0001samples 87 and 89\u0002 tends to lower\nthe content of Si and it is lowered further when the sample\ndoes not receive any CdCl2 treatment or chemical etching\n\u0001sample 87\u0002. It should be recalled here that, as detailed in our\nreported study,4 no trace of Si was detected in the CdCl2\npowder used for the treatment of these samples. This also\nexcludes the possibility of Si migration from the substrate as\nsuggested in our previous study of device structures grown\non soda-lime glass since sapphire was used here as\nsubstrate.11 One can therefore only suspect a Si contamina-\ntion during the chemical etching process that is performed in\na borosilicate glass beaker with the same etching solution\nused to etch several samples most of them were grown on\nsoda-lime glass substrates. This plausible origin of Si is em-\nphasized by the gradient shown by Si in the first \u00053 \u0002m\nfrom the CdTe surface downwards in the etched samples \u000185\nand 89\u0002 compared to the unetched one \u000187\u0002. It is also sup-\nported by the fact that for the samples grown on soda-lime\nglass substrates, the increase in the Si concentration is also\nFIG. 1.

This allowed\ndetermination of the thickness for the CdTe layers: sample\n85 has the thickest CdTe layer \u0001\u00058.5 \u0002m\u0002 while samples 87\nand 89 have CdTe thicknesses of about 7.5 \u0002m.\nB. Impurity species in the CdS window layer\nSince the CdS layer is comparatively very thin, it has not\nbeen possible to resolve all the impurity species investigated\nin this study in the CdS. We will therefore show only the\ndepth profiles for which the CdS layer was resolved, as no\nquantitative information could be extracted from the remain-\ning profiles where it was very hard to distinguish signals in\nthe CdS from tails in the CdTe and TCO layers.\nFigure 3 shows the depth profiles of F, Br, Cl, Na, and Si\nquantified using CdS RSFs. S profiles, with concentrations in\narbitrary units, were added in this figure to provide an ap-\nproximate determination of the location and extent of the\nCdS layer within the structures. However, an accurate quan-\ntification of the depth profiled is complicated by changes in\nsputter rate at different interfaces. As mentioned in the pre-\nvious section, the layer depth scales were calibrated accord-\ning to the sputter rate in CdTe that is larger than in CdS,\nleading to a CdS layer that appears much broader than its\nnominal thickness. The CdS layer appears thicker also be-\ncause of the initial roughening of the CdTe surface as exhib-\nited by the shape of most of the profiles near this surface, i.e.,\nin the SIMS transient region.\nFor fluorine, CdS layer can only be slightly resolved for\nsample 87 \u0001untreated\u0002 with a maximum concentration shoul-\nder around 5\u00011019 cm\u22123 but for both treated samples 85 and\n89, F is found to interdiffuse at the CdS\/TCO interface to the\nextent that its profiles do not resolve the CdS layer. Bromine\nhas a peak concentration in CdS of about 1018 cm\u22123 for all\nthree samples. However, like F, Br peak in CdS is better\nresolved for the untreated sample than for the treated ones.\nAlso, both F and Br in CdS do not seem to have any corre-\nlation with the oxygen concentration in CdTe. Chlorine has a\nsimilar behavior in CdS as seen above for CdTe. Indeed, the\ntreated samples have a Cl concentration in CdS \u0003\u00011\u20132\u0002\n\u00011021 cm\u22123\u0004 up to 200 times higher compared to the un-\ntreated one \u00014\u00011019 cm\u22123\u0002. Furthermore, when oxygen is\nincorporated in CdTe, it leads also to a two times increase in\nthe Cl concentration in CdS as if there is an interdependence\nbetween O \u0001in CdTe\u0002 and Cl in terms of presence and con-\ncentration. Na profiles show a peak in the CdS layer with a\nconcentration that does not seem to depend either on the\nCdCl2 treatment or the oxygen incorporation during CdTe\ndeposition\u2014the peak concentration is \u00055\u00011019 cm\u22123 for\nboth samples 85 and 87. Unlike its behavior in CdTe, the Si\npeak concentration in CdS decreases from 1020 cm\u22123 before\nCdCl2 treatment to 6\u00011019 cm\u22123 and 1018 cm\u22123 upon treat-\nment, respectively, for samples grown with and without oxy-\ngen. Si behavior in CdS is, however, in agreement with our\nfindings for CdS layers of device structures depth profiled\nfrom the front side and was interpreted by the possible for-\nmation of SiCl4 compound that is gaseous at the heat treat-\nment temperature used.12\nThe oxygen profile could not be resolved in the CdS\nlayer and therefore the oxygen concentration in CdS could\nnot be measured and compared for the devices considered.\nAs a result, no conclusion could be made as to whether the\nintentional introduction of oxygen in CdTe during its growth\nenhances the oxygen concentration in CdS although the oxy-\ngen presence in CdTe was found to increase the chlorine\nconcentration in CdS as shown above. Overall, from S pro-\nfiles shown in Fig. 3, CdS layer seems to have sharper inter-\nfaces for sample 87 \u0001untreated\u0002 and interdiffused and thus\nbroader ones for the treated samples \u000185 and 89\u0002, especially\nthe interface with the CdTe layer.\nC. On the resulting solar cell devices\nIt should be noticed that the back contact deposition to-\ngether with the device assessment were carried out after\nSIMS measurements were completed. About five months\nelapsed between the initial growth of these structures and the\nfinal measurements of their device characteristics.\nThe device made from sample 87 did not give any result\nsince there were many pinholes in the layers.

Only samples 87 and 89 were grown\nwith oxygen incorporated in their CdTe layer during its growth, and only\nsamples 85 and 89 underwent a postgrowth processing as shown in Table I.\n013513-4 Emziane et al.

The device parameters of 1 cm2 solar\ncell from samples 85 and 89 were reported recently and it\nwas found that the device parameters of sample 89 \u0001with O\nin CdTe\u0002 were all increased compared to those of sample 85\n\u0001without O in CdTe\u0002.13 This relative increase was \u00054% for\nthe open-circuit voltage \u0001from 780 to 812 mV\u0002, \u00059% for the\nshort-circuit current density \u0001from 23 to 25 mA\/cm2\u0002 and\n\u00058% for the fill factor \u0001from 0.64 to 0.69\u0002. The device effi-\nciency increased from 11.5% for sample 85 to 14% for\nsample 89, i.e., an improvement of \u000522% as a result of O\nintroduction in CdTe.13\nIt is believed that in situ oxygen incorporation into CdTe\ntogether with the increased concentration of chlorine in CdTe\nand in CdS due to this presence of oxygen may both contrib-\nute to the improvement of the solar device parameters. O and\nconsequently Cl seem therefore to be electrically active\nand\/or form electrically active complexes within the CdTe\nabsorber layer and, to a less extent, within the CdS window\nlayer as well, leading ultimately to an improved overall per-\nformance of the CdTe\/CdS solar cell device.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nCdTe\/CdS photovoltaic devices were fabricated on sap-\nphire substrates using SnO2\/ ITO:F as TCO bilayer and\nMo\/Sb2Te3 as back contact. The CdTe layer was deposited\nwith oxygen introduction during its growth and the device\nstructures were postdeposition heat treated with CdCl2 and\nchemically etched.\nWe found that an intentional in situ introduction of oxy-\ngen into the CdTe absorber layer affected the resulting device\nby improving all its parameters, and led to an enhanced ef-\nficiency of 14% compared to 11.5% for devices fabricated in\nthe same conditions without oxygen incorporation in CdTe\nduring its growth.\nQuantitative SIMS investigation was carried out on the\ndevices and revealed that oxygen and chlorine were interde-\npendent in terms of presence and concentration separately in\nCdTe as well as in CdS to a lesser extent. In other words,\noxygen incorporation in CdTe layer was found to favor the\nuptake of Cl in both CdTe and CdS layers. The increased Na\nconcentration in CdTe was found to be caused solely by the\nCdCl2 treatment and Na concentration in CdS was un-\nchanged. Br was found to originate from the chemical etch-\ning and F profile was shown to flatten following processing.\nSi was found to behave differently in CdS and CdTe while Cl\nhad a similar behavior in both layers. The presence of oxy-\ngen had no observable effect on Br, F, In, and Sn in either\nCdTe or CdS.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors are thankful to the EPSRC for financial sup-\nport under Grant No. GR\/R39283\/01, and to A.
