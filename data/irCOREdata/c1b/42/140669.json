Their work developed the widely used radioimmunoassay to\nexamine the properties of insulin-binding antibodies in human serum, using samples\nobtained from subjects that had been treated with insulin.\nFollowing the newly developed immunoassay technique, the concept of a\nbiosensor was pioneered by Clark and Lyons in 1962 (Clark & Lyons, 1962). The\noriginal methodology was to immobilise enzymes on the surface of electrochemical\nsensors-assuming that this would enhance the ability of a sensor to detect specific\nanalytes. This idea has remained virtually unchanged since this original design,\nhowever, technological advances have allowed for the expansion of this field of science.\nThe incorporation of antibodies into conducting polymer films was first reported\nin 1991 (John et al 1991). Anti-human serum albumin (anti-HSA) was incorporated into\na polypyrrole film, which was galvanostatically polymerised onto a platinum wire\nsubstrate. When grown in the absence of a counterion, a poor polymeric film, both in\nappearance and electrochemical properties was formed, suggesting that the presence of\na counterion was necessary for the polymerisation process to be successful. Amino acid\nanalysis of the polymer using a leucine marker showed that approximately 0.1% w\/v\n(0.2 Pg) of the antibody was incorporated into\nthe matrix. When the pyrrole anti-HSA electrode was exposed to 50 Pg ml-1 HSA for ten\nminutes, a new reduction peak was observed at a potential of approximately +600mV\nvs. Ag\/AgCl. This peak increased in magnitude after a further thirty minutes in the same\nsolution and it was suggested this could be due to an antibody\/antigen interaction with\nthe polymer. Further work by the same group gave rise to reports of a\nreversible real-time immunosensor (John et al 1991). Other early work utilised a pulsed\namperometric detection technique for other analytes, including p-cresol (Barnett et al\n1994), Thaumatin (Sadik et al 1994) and polychlorinated biphenyls (Bender and Sadik\n1994). Since this work there has been a huge increase in the development of\nelectrochemical immunosensors as detailed in several recent reviews (Rodriguez-Mozaz\net al 2006, Diaz-Gonzalez et al 2005, Cosnier 2005).\nAntibody-antigen interactions are by their very nature complex and the\nreproducible response characteristics of immunosensors requires that the affinity\nreaction occurring is minimally perturbed by the fabrication procedure. We have\npreviously shown that up to 2-3 Pg antibodies for BSA and digoxin may be successfully\nincorporated into conducting polymer films by entrapment in a growing polypyrrole\nfilm with no detrimental effect to antibody activity (Grant et al 2003). Electrochemical\ninterrogation of these films demonstrated selective interactions with the target antigens.\nFurther work utilised an AC impedance protocol (Grant et al 2005) as the method of\ninterrogation for these films and led to the development of immunosensors for digoxin\nand bovine serum albumin.\nThe quinolones are a family of broad-spectrum antibiotics with the majority of\nquinolones in clinical use being fluoroquinolones, which have a fluoro group attached to\nthe central ring system. They are widely used within adult patients because of excellent\ntissue penetration which makes them extremely effective against bacteria that grow\nintracellularly such as salmonella (Gendrei et al 2003). One of this group is\nciprofloxacin (Figure 1) which is a broad-spectrum antibiotic active against many\nbacteria including anthrax (Torriero et al 2006). Many of these fluoroquinolones are\nadded to farm animal feed since they can lead to greater and more rapid weight gain.\nUnfortunately the effect of this is thought to have enabled the rise of resistant species of\nbacteria (Gendrei et al 2003).\nThe monitoring of fluoroquinolones within both food and the environment is\nimportant since these antibiotics have potential health and environmental damaging\neffects. Ciprofloxacin concentrations in hospital wastewaters were monitored and\ncorrelations with DNA damaging effects made (Hartmann et al 1999). Levels of\nciprofloxacin in hospital outflow water between 0.7-124.5 ng ml-1 were measured using\nHPLC (Hartmann et al 1999) and shown to display genotoxicity at levels as low as 5.2\nng ml-1. Similar work (Batt et al 2006) measured wastewater ciprofloxacin using\nLC\/MS\/MS and found levels between 0.031-5.6 ng ml-1 (even after treatment) with a\nlimit of detection of 0.030 ng ml-1. Levels in vivo have also been widely studied with\nthe therapeutic ranges typically being between 0.57-2.30 Pg ml-1 in serum and 1.26-4.03\nPg g-1 in tissue (Licitra et al 1987).\nA recent publication (Torriero et al 2006) details the use of a horseradish\nperoxidase based biosensor for the detection of ciprofloxacin due to its inhibition of the\noxidation of catechol, however other piperazine based compounds could potentially\ninterfere with this determination. Linear responses were obtained between 0.02-65 PM\nwith the limit of detection being 0.4 nM. We have within this work developed a labeless\nimmunosensor for ciprofloxacin as a typical fluoroquinolone. The sensor utilises screen-\nprinted carbon electrodes, modified by deposition of first, a conducting polymer\n(polyaniline) which is then modified with biotinylating reagent. Complexion of the\nimmobilised biotin with avidin allows the further binding of biotinylated antibodies via\nstandard avidin-biotin interactions (Figure 2). The resultant electrodes are capable of\ndetecting low levels of the antigen - ciprofloxacin. Control\nelectrodes containing non-specific IgG have also been fabricated and allow the\nsubtraction out of unspecific interactions.\nEXPERIMENTAL\nSodium dihydrogen orthophosphate, disodium hydrogen orthophosphate,\nsodium chloride, hydrochloric acid, were obtained from BDH (Poole, Dorset, UK).\nPotassium chloride was obtained from Fisher Scientific UK Ltd, Loughborough, UK.\nAniline, polyclonal IgG from human serum, the biotinylation kit (part no. BK101),\nbiotin 3 -sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide, avidin, bovine serum albumin (BSA), potassium\nferrocyanide and potassium ferricyanide were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich,\nGillingham, Dorset, UK. All water used was obtained from a Purelab UHQ Deioniser\n(Elga, High Wycombe, UK). Commercial screen-printed carbon electrodes (Figure 3)\ncontaining carbon working and counter electrodes and an Ag\/AgCl reference electrode\nwere obtained from Parlex Corp Ltd, Isle of Wight, UK. The surface area of the\nworking electrode was 0.2 178 cm2.\nPhosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) at pH 7.4 stock solution was prepared\ncontaining 0.14 mol l-1 NaH2PO4, 0.52 mol l-1 Na2HPO4 and 0.005 1 mol l-1 NaCl. Aniline\nbuffer (pH 1-2) was prepared containing 0.5 mol l-1 KCl, 0.3 mol l-1 HCl and 0.2 mol l-1\naniline.\nPolyclonal antiserum (As 171) was raised against 1-(3mercaptopropyl)-6-fluoro-\n7-(piperanicyl)- 1 ,4-dihydro-4-oxo-quinoline-3 -carboxylic acid coupled to HCH. The\npreparation of the immunogen and of the antibodies will be described elsewhere\n(Pinacho et al., 2007).\nFor antibody biotinylation the procedure outlined in the BK101 kit was followed\n(see manufacturers instructions for details). Biotinylated antibodies were kept frozen in\naliquots of 200 Pl at a concentration of 1 mg ml-1 until required.\nCyclic voltammetry (Sycopel Potentiometer, Sycopel Scientific, Tyne & Wear,\nUK) was utilised to deposit polyaniline films on the carbon electrodes. Screen-printed\ncarbon electrodes were placed in aniline buffer and cycled from -200 mV to +800 mV\nvs. Ag\/AgCl for approximately 20 cycles (occasionally this was varied slightly to\nensure the same amount of polyaniline was deposited on each electrode. Deposition was\nterminated at +800 mV to ensure the polyaniline remained in its conducting form. After\ndeposition electrodes were rinsed in water.\n30 \u03bcl of biotin-sulfo-NHS (10 mg ml-1 in water) was placed on the polymer\ncoated working electrode surface for 24 hours. The sensors were rinsed with copious\nwater and 30 \u03bcl of avidin (10 \u03bcg ml-1 in water) placed on the working electrode for 1\nhour followed by rinsing in water. Then 30 \u03bcl biotinylated antibody (1 mg ml-1 in water)\nwas added followed by rinsing. Finally, non-specific interactions were blocked by BSA\n(10-6 M in PBS); the sensors are ready to use at this point, however, if opted, can be\nstored in PBS at 4oC for no longer than 24 hours.\nAC impedance measurements were performed using an ACM Auto AC DSP\nfrequency response analyser. Antigen solutions for AC impedance were prepared by\ndiluting the required concentration of antigen in 30ml of PBS pH 7.4. A range of\nconcentrations were utilised, since genotoxicity is noted at levels above 5.2 ng ml-1; we\nset our minimum level at 1 ng ml-1 with an upper limit of 10 Pg ml-1, which covers the\ntherapeutic\/clinical range. However other work within our group suggests detection\nlimits of about 10 pg ml-1. The sensors were first interrogated without antigen addition.\nFollowing this, each sensor was exposed to the required antigen\nconcentration for 30 minutes, rinsed well with deionised water and then subjected to\nimpedance interrogation. Potassium ferrocyanide (10 mM) and potassium ferricyanide\n(10 mM) in PBS buffer were utilised as a redox couple for impedimetric measurements.\nThree electrodes were used for each measurement. A frequency range from 10 kHz to 1\nHz was measured, with a peak amplitude of 5 mV and a DC offset of +400 mV against\nAg\/AgCl.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nDeposition of polyaniline\nThe voltammograms for the deposition of polyaniline\/DNA are depicted in Fig.\n4 and imply a steady in situ formation of polymer at the electrode surface. As the\nnumber of scans increases peaks appear between +350-400 mV vs Ag\/AgCl\ncorresponding to the oxidation and reduction of surface bound polyaniline. The increase\nin current from scan 10 to 20 is due to the increase in polyaniline thickness and\ncoverage of the electrode.\nImpedance profiles of the electrodes\nA series of Nyquist curves were obtained for the sensors after exposure to\nvarious levels of ciprofloxacin in PBS (Figure 5a). As can be seen, there is a steady\ndecrease in the impedance of the electrodes with increasing antigen concentration. The\nrelative conductivities of the system, which are obtained by dividing the impedance for\neach frequency with no antigen present - by the impedance (at the same frequency) for\neach antigen concentration are shown in Figure 5b. As can be seen, we see much larger\nincreases in conductivity at the lower frequencies. Therefore\nit was decided that changes in impedance at 1 Hz would be used as a measurement of\nantigen binding.\nThe impedance spectra consists of two components, the real (Z') component\nwhere the impedance in phase with the AC potential waveform is measured and the\nimaginary (Z\") where the impedance is 180o out of phase. It is important to differentiate\nbetween the individual components of the total impedance of the cell so that the\ncapacitive and Faradaic components of the composite impedimetric response may be\nidentified and quantified. Previous work by our group showed that while both the\nimaginary and real components increase, the increase in the real component dominated\nthe total increase in the impedance (Grant et al 2005). Although in this case changes in\nboth real and imaginary components are visible and again the real component is the\nmajor component of total impedance, perhaps more importantly it was also found that\nthe real component offers far greater reproducibility in comparison to the imaginary\ncontribution.\nFigure 6a shows the percentage decrease in Z' across a range of antigen\nconcentrations. As can be seen, there is a steady decrease in impedance as antigen\nconcentration increases up to a concentration of about 100 ng ml-1, above which\nconcentration there is a tend towards a plateau, possibly indicating saturation of the\nspecific binding sites. It is possible that any further changes in impedance beyond this\nlevel could simply be due to non-specific interactions. Between a concentration range of\n1-100 ng ml-1, there is a near linear correlation of the impedance change with the log10\nof concentration (R2=0.96).\nNon-specific interactions could potentially interfere with immunosensor performance.\nThis could be addressed by utilisation of a second sensor containing either no\nantibodies - or alternatively a non-specific antibody. Therefore an identical set of\nimmunosensors were fabricated utilising a non-specific IgG antibody in place of the\nspecific ciprofloxacin antibody. Results for these electrodes were obtained in exactly\nthe same way and the calibration plot is shown (Figure 6b). As can be seen, there is a\nmuch lower response for the non-specific antibody, showing that although there are\nnon-specific interactions, between the ranges of 1-100 ng ml-1, they comprise a minor\ncomponent of the detected response. Figure 6c shows the subtracted responses (6a-6b)\nand again this demonstrates linearity between the response and the log10 of ciprofloxacin\nconcentration between 1-100 ng ml-1 (R2=0.96).\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe have demonstrated the construction of an immunosensor for the antibiotic\nciprofloxacin using a combination of screen-printed electrodes coated with conducting\npolyaniline and an immobilised polyclonal antibody. Interrogation of the electrodes by\nAC impedance demonstrated the detection of the antigen. Linear correlation of the\nimpedance change with the log10 of concentration (R2=0.96) was observed between\nconcentrations of 1-100 ng ml-1.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis work has been supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology (Spain)\n(Contract numbers AGL2005-07700-C06-01 and NAN2004-09195-C04-04) and by the\nEuropean Community Framework VI NMP2-CT-2003-505485, \u201cELISHA\u201d contract.\nThe AMR group is a consolidated Grup de Recerca de la Generalitat de Catalunya and\nhas support from the Departament d\u2019Universitats, Recerca i Societat de\nla Informaci\u00f3 la Generalitat de Catalunya (expedient 2005 SGR 00207).
