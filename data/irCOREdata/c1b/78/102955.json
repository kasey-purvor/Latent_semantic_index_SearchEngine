Its unique\nredox chemistry has been exploited by biological systems\nsince the advent of dioxygen in the earth\u2019s environment\ncreated a requirement for a two-electron detoxification\nsystem for dealing with peroxides (Frausto da Silva &\nWilliams, 2001). Its crucial role is underlined by the fact\nthat it is the only trace element to be specified in the\ngenetic code (RJP Williams, personal communication),\nas selenocysteine (SeCys; the 21st amino acid), which\nwhen incorporated into selenoproteins, protects tissues\nand membranes from oxidative stress and controls cell\nredox status (Rayman, 2000). As will be seen later, SeCys\nis \u2018dramatically different from the other twenty amino\nacids in the mode of its incorporation and basic biosyn-\nthetic steps\u2019 (Hatfield & Gladyshev, 2002) and this\ncomplex insertion machinery for selenoprotein production\nhas implications for the Se requirements for cancer\nprevention.\nAbbreviations: GPx, glutathione peroxidase; HR, hazard ratio; MnSOD, Mn superoxide dismutase; NPC, Nutritional Prevention of Cancer; OR, odds\nratio; RR, relative risk; SeCys, selenocysteine; SeMe, selenomethyl; Sep15, 15 kDa selenoprotein; SECIS, SeCys-insertion sequence; SNP, single-\nnucleotide polymorphism.\n*Corresponding author: Dr Margaret Rayman, fax + 44 1483 686481, email M.Rayman@surrey.ac.uk\nProceedings of the Nutrition Society (2005), 64, 527\u2013542 DOI:10.1079\/PNS2005467\ng The Author 2005\nEvidence is accruing, some of which will be presented,\nthat the level of intake of Se affects the risk of cancer and\nmay even inhibit its spread from a primary tumour. Since\nUK deaths from cancer in adults now outnumber deaths\nfrom IHD and stroke, and approximately one in three of\nthe European population will be diagnosed with cancer\nduring their lifetime (CancerStats, 2004a,b), it is timely to\nconsider the potential of Se for cancer reduction.\nThe nature of the Se species involved in anti-cancer\nprocesses is still a matter of speculation and much ongoing\nexperimental work. Whether the selenoproteins are crucial\nto the anti-cancer effects requires some understanding of\nthe biosynthetic machinery involved and of the function\nof some of the selenoproteins most likely to be relevant to\ncancer. These issues will be addressed.\nSelenoproteins\nBiosynthesis\nUnlike the other twenty amino acids, SeCys is biosynthe-\nsised on its own tRNA, Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec, from selenophos-\nphate as the Se source. Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec has many unusual\nfeatures, including its long length (Hatfield & Gladyshev,\n2002). The insertion of SeCys is specified by the UGA\ncodon in mRNA. However, as UGA is also a stop codon\nthe presence of a stem\u2013loop structure in mRNA, a SeCys\ninsertion sequence (SECIS) element, downstream from\nUGA in the 3\n0\n-mRNA-untranslated region is also required\nfor UGA to be read as SeCys. SECIS elements function by\nrecruiting additional factors, including the SECIS-binding\nprotein, the SeCys-specific elongation factor and Sec\ntRNA[Ser]Sec, to form the large SeCys insertion complex\nrequired for the synthesis of selenoproteins and known as\nthe selenosome (Berry et al. 1991, 1993; Hatfield &\nGladyshev, 2002). The human selenoproteome consists of\ntwenty-five selenoproteins (Kryukov et al. 2003).\nSome selenoproteins of particular relevance to cancer\nThe functions of many of the twenty-five human seleno-\nproteins are as yet unknown, although they generally par-\nticipate in antioxidant and anabolic processes (Hatfield &\nGladyshev, 2002). Selenoproteins that may be relevant to\ncancer risk are described in Table 1 and include a number\nfrom the glutathione peroxidase (GPx) family, the 15 kDa\nselenoprotein (Sep15), selenoprotein P and the thioredoxin\nreductases, although a beneficial role of the thioredoxin\nreductases in cancer prevention is doubtful.\nSelenium intakes and status of adults in\ndifferent countries\nIf Se may protect against cancer, an adequate intake of\nSe is desirable. Whether the intake of Se is adequate is,\nhowever, questionable in much of Europe and some other\nparts of the world. Mean intake levels in a number of\ncountries (Combs, 2001; Rayman, 2004) are shown in\nFig. 1, which also indicates the range of Se intake believed\nto be required for optimal activity of plasma GPx\n(Thomson et al. 1993; Duffield et al. 1999). It is clear that\nthe level of intake in Europe and some parts of China is not\nadequate for full expression of GPx. (According to Combs\n(2001), the same may be true of other parts of the world, as\nthere is little or no information on Se intake or status for\nmost of Africa, South America and central and south Asia.)\nFurthermore, an updated study of Se requirements by\nBurk\u2019s group in collaboration with Chinese colleagues\n(Xia et al. 2005) has shown that full expression of sele-\nnoprotein P requires a greater Se intake than that required\nTable 1.

Thus, it is even more\nlikely that current intakes are inadequate for optimising the\nprotective effects of the selenoproteins. Indeed, there is\nevidence that will be outlined that suggests that levels of\nSe intake that are supra-nutritional may be required to\nreduce cancer risk (Combs, 2001; Rayman, 2002).\nEvidence for an effect of selenium on cancer risk\nThe evidence for Se as a cancer preventive agent has been\nreviewed ably by a number of researchers (for example,\nsee Combs & Grey, 1998; Ip, 1998; Combs & Lu\u00a8, 2001;\nKnekt, 2002; Whanger, 2004; Combs, 2005), and includes\nfindings from in vitro, animal, geographic (ecological) and\nprospective studies, and from interventions with Se. Such\nevidence will be summarised and updated, although\nin vitro studies and studies on Se compounds that cannot\narise from food sources will only be referred to briefly (for\nmore detail, see Combs & Grey, 1998; Ip, 1998; Combs &\nLu\u00a8, 2001; Knekt, 2002; Whanger, 2004; Combs, 2005).\nCase\u2013control studies will be excluded as it is not possible\nto distinguish between Se concentration as an indicator of\ncancer risk and Se concentration that is a consequence of\nthe disease process (Overvad, 1998).\nAnimal studies\nExtensive experimental evidence indicates that Se supple-\nmentation reduces the incidence of cancer in animals\n(Medina & Morrison, 1988; Combs & Gray, 1998; Combs\n& Lu\u00a8, 2001). However, it is difficult to generalise from\nsuch studies and extrapolate to the human situation, as\nanimal studies have generally used doses at least ten times\ngreater than those required to prevent clinical signs of\ndeficiency, which, on a per unit body-weight basis, are\nconsiderably higher than most human Se intakes. However,\nit is worth describing a supplementation study on male\nbeagle dogs, a species that develops spontaneous prostate\ncancer, as the lower dose given is reasonable for man.\nSupplementation of the diet of sexually-intact elderly male\ndogs with Se, as selenomethionine or high-Se yeast, at 3 or\n6mg\/kg body weight per d for 7 months was found to\nreduce DNA damage and up-regulate epithelial cell apop-\ntosis in their prostates, while no such effects were seen in\nthe dogs that were not supplemented (Waters et al. 2003).\nIt appears that Se sensitises prostate epithelial cells so that\ncells with extensive DNA damage undergo apoptosis\nin vivo.\nGeographical (ecological) studies\nSince as early as the 1960s geographical studies have\nshown a consistent trend for populations with low Se\nintakes to have higher cancer mortality rates (Shamberger\n& Frost, 1969; Schrauzer et al. 1977; Clark et al. 1991). In\none such study (Schrauzer et al. 1977), inverse correlations\nwere observed between apparent dietary Se intakes esti-\nmated from food-consumption data in twenty-seven\nCzech Republic\nCroatia\nSerbia\nUK\nSweden\nPoland\nGermany\nFrance\nSlovakia\nDenmark\nBelgium\nAustria\nThe Netherlands\nNew Zealand\nSwitzerland\nAustralia\nUSA\nJapan\nCanada\nVenezuela\nSelenosis\nModerate\nK Disease\n0 50 100 150 200\nMean Se intake (\u00b5g\/d)\n250 300 350 400 5000\nChina\nFig. 1.

However, the value\nof evidence from this type of study is not rated very highly\nby epidemiologists.\nProspective and nested case\u2013control studies\nKnekt (2002) has tabulated the results of prospective\nstudies of Se and cancer published up to the end of 1998.\nThe following categories are included: all cancers; lung\ncancer; colo-rectal, gastrointestinal and stomach cancers;\nprostate cancer; female cancers; miscellaneous cancers that\ninclude cancers of the liver, bladder, mouth, pharynx,\noesophagus and malignant melanoma. Of approximately\nseventy-two table entries, fifty entries show a lower risk\nassociated with higher Se intake or status, although only\nin eighteen studies (25%) that included all cancers and\ncancers of the bladder, lung, ovary, prostate, stomach and\nthyroid is the risk significantly reduced.\nMore recent evidence that Se status can influence\nmortality from all cancers combined has been found in a\ncohort of 1389 male and female volunteers recruited in the\nEtude du Vieillissement Arte\u00b4riel (Akbaraly et al. 2005).\nMean baseline plasma Se levels in the cohort were reported\nto be 86mg\/l, which is similar to levels in much of Europe.\nDuring the 9-year follow-up, 101 subjects died, fifty-five of\nthem from cancer. The risk of mortality from cancer was\nshown to be increased fourfold in subjects in the bottom\nquartile of baseline plasma Se compared with those in the\ntop quartile (relative risk (RR) 4.06 (95% CI 1.51, 10.92);\nP = 0.006).\nThe strongest evidence for a beneficial effect of Se from\nprospective studies appears to relate to lung cancer,\noesophageal and gastric-cardia cancers and, most notably,\nprostate cancer. The risk of colo-rectal adenoma, a pre-\ncancerous condition, also seems to be affected.\nLung cancer. A recent meta-analysis of existing\nepidemiological evidence from sixteen studies has shown\na significantly decreased risk of lung cancer (summary\nRR 0.74) associated with higher Se exposure (Zhuo et al.\n2004; Table 3). The effects were found to occur primarily\nin populations of low Se exposure (defined as serum Se\n<100 mg\/l or intake <55 mg\/d). In studies carried out in\nhigh-Se areas (defined as serum Se >100 mg\/l or intake\n>55 mg\/d) protective effects appeared on moving from the\nlowest Se category to the second-lowest Se category, but\nincreasing Se exposure thereafter appeared to have little\nfurther effect, suggesting the existence of a threshold\neffect.\nOesophageal cancer and gastric-cardia cancer. In a\nnested study from the Nutrition Intervention Trial in\nLinxian, China, significant inverse associations were found\nbetween baseline serum Se concentration as a continuous\nvariable and death from oesophageal squamous cell carci-\nnoma (RR 0.83 (95% CI 0.71, 0.98)) and gastric-cardia\ncancer [RR 0.75 (95% CI 0.59, 0.95)] in 1103 subjects\nrandomly-selected from the larger trial cohort and followed\nfor 15 years (Wei et al. 2004). When the subjects were\nclassified by quartile of baseline Se, those in the highest\nquartile had a 65% significant reduction in the risk of death\nfrom oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (RR 0.35\n(95% CI 0.16, 0.81)) and a 69% significant reduction in\nthe risk of death from gastric-cardia cancer (RR 0.31 (95%\nCI 0.11, 0.87)) when compared with the subjects in the\nlowest quartile. The mean population serum Se concentra-\ntion in the cohort (73 mg\/l) was relatively low. It has been\nsuggested by Wei et al. (2004) that population-wide Se\nsupplementation in regions of China with low serum\nSe levels and high rates of these cancers merits serious\nconsideration.\nProstate cancer. Results from large prospective\nstudies of prostate cancer (Knekt et al. 1990; Yoshizawa\net al. 1998; Helzlsouer et al. 2000; Nomura et al. 2000;\nBrooks et al. 2001; Goodman et al. 2001; van den Brandt\net al. 2003; Li et al. 2004) are shown in Table 2. Those\npublished in 2003 and 2004 were large studies with 540\n(van den Brandt et al. 2003) and 586 (Li et al. 2004) cases.\nOf the eight prospective studies listed seven show a\nreduced risk of prostate cancer overall for the highest\nv. lowest category of Se status, the risk being significantly\nreduced in five studies. When the analysis is confined to\nsubjects who had advanced prostate cancer or a baseline\nprostate-specific antigen of >4 ng\/ml, six of the eight\nprospective studies show a significant reduction in\nprostate cancer in the subjects in the highest category of\nSe status.\nAlthough the study of Knekt et al. (1990) in Finland\nshowed no relationship between serum Se concentration\nand prostate cancer risk, Platz & Helzlsouer (2001) have\nnoted that the participants had circulating levels almost\nthree times lower than those reported in the other studies\n(approximately 50mg\/l v. 150mg\/l). Thus, it may be pos-\nsible that the concentration of Se in this cohort was below\nthe threshold at which Se can exert a protective effect on\nprostate cancer risk. This possibility is given credence by\nthe study of Nomura et al. (2000), which has shown that\nthere is a protective effect (odds ratio (OR) 0.5) mainly in\nsubjects with serum Se concentrations >147mg\/l, with an\nOR of approximately 1 in lower quartiles of plasma Se.\nIn a number of these studies (Yoshizawa et al. 1998;\nNomura et al. 2000; van den Brandt et al. 2003; Li et al.\n2004) the protective effect of Se has been shown to be\nstronger for advanced prostate cancer, i.e. disease that has\nspread beyond the prostate, than for localised disease.\nFurthermore, when data from the Physicians\u2019 Health Study\nwere analysed according to baseline prostate-specific anti-\ngen level, the protective effect was found to be significant\nfor all prostate cancers (both localised and advanced\ndisease) but only in those with baseline prostate specific\nantigen >4 ng\/ml (Li et al. 2004), again suggesting a major\neffect of Se on prostate cancer progression rather than\ninitiation.\nTwo studies have suggested that smoking modifies the\neffect of Se. The Netherlands Cohort Study has shown by\nfar the strongest effect of Se in ex-smokers (van den\nBrandt et al. 2003), while the inverse association between\nSe and prostate cancer was found to be mainly present in\ncurrent or past cigarette smokers in the study of Nomura\net al. (2000).\nColo-rectal adenoma. Colo-rectal adenoma is closely\nassociated with subsequent development of colo-rectal\ncancer (Weingarten et al. 2005). Jacobs et al. (2004) have\n530 M. P. Rayman\ncarried out a pooled analysis of data from three studies that\ncould be considered as prospective studies of Se and risk\nof colo-rectal adenoma. The Wheat Bran Fiber Trial\n(Alberts et al. 2000), the Polyp Prevention Trial (Schatzkin\net al. 2000) and the Polyp Prevention Study (Greenberg\net al. 1994) were 3\u20134-year interventions in subjects that\nhad recently undergone adenoma removal, 1763 of whom\nhad baseline serum or plasma Se levels measured. The risk\nof adenoma recurrence was not affected by any of the\ninterventions. Analysis of pooled data showed that the\nsubjects with baseline serum or plasma Se in the highest\nquartile (median 150mg\/l), when compared with those in\nthe lowest quartile (median 113mg\/l), had a significantly\nlower risk of adenoma recurrence (OR 0.66 (95% CI 0.50,\n0.87). These results support previous findings that are\nsuggestive of a beneficial effect of higher Se status on\ncolo-rectal cancer risk (Jacobs et al. 2004).\nIntervention studies including randomised controlled trials\nChinese trials. National Cancer Institute-sponsored\ntrials in China for the prevention of oesophageal and\ngastric cancer have observed a reduction in total cancer\nmortality and a reduced incidence of oesophageal and\ngastric-cardia cancers in the intervention arm comprising\nSe, b-carotene and vitamin E (Blot et al. 1993; Mark et al.\n2000). Although Se was not a single agent in these trials, it\nis likely to have been the most effective component,\nparticularly in the light of subsequent studies (Wei et al.\n2004). (As one of a number of agents in an Indian trial Se\nhas also been shown to aid the remission of precancerous\nlesions of the oral cavity (Krishnaswamy et al. 1995;\nPrasad et al. 1995).)\nHepatocellular carcinoma is highly prevalent in\nChina.

In this region approximately 15% of\nadults carry the hepatitis B surface antigen and these\nindividuals are 200 times more likely to develop hepato-\ncellular carcinoma. In a study in which 226 hepatitis B\nantigen carriers were randomised to a Se (200mg)-enriched\nyeast tablet or a placebo, no case of hepatocellular carci-\nnoma was reported to occur in the Se-supplemented group\nafter 4 years, while seven subjects in the unsupplemented\nplacebo group had developed hepatocellular carcinoma\n(Yu et al. 1997). However, as full details of the metho-\ndology of this study are not available, it is difficult to\nassess whether its protocol was sufficiently well-controlled\nor robust to be confident in its conclusions.\nA recent systematic review and meta-analysis of anti-\noxidant supplements for the prevention of gastrointestinal\ncancers has assessed the evidence for an effect of Se\n(Bjelakovic et al. 2004). Data from three Chinese trials\nwere included, two of which used selenised yeast (Yu et al.\n1997), while the third trial used Na2SeO3 (Li et al. 2000).\nBjelakovic et al. (2004) concluded that, in contrast to other\nantioxidant nutrients, Se showed a significant beneficial\neffect, reducing the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma by\n50% (RR 0.50 (95% CI 0.35, 0.71)).\nThe Nutritional Prevention of Cancer Trial and\nfollow-up analyses. The strongest evidence of the\nefficacy of Se as an anti-cancer agent, particularly for\nprostate cancer, is provided by the Nutritional Prevention\nof Cancer (NPC) trial, carried out by Clark and co-workers\n(Clark et al. 1996, 1998; Duffield-Lillico et al. 2002,\n2003a,b). Subjects (n 1312) with a history of non-\nmelanoma skin cancer were randomised to placebo or\n200mg Se (as Se-enriched yeast)\/d. After 4.5 years of\ntreatment and 6.5 years of follow-up no effect was found\non the primary end point of non-melanoma skin cancer.\nHowever, in those subjects receiving Se, significant\nsecondary end-point effects of 50% lower total cancer\nmortality and 37% lower total cancer incidence were\nfound, with fewer prostate, colo\u2013rectal and lung cancers\n(Table 4). Follow-up analyses to the end of the blinded\ntreatment period, a further 25 months, showed a reduced\neffect on total cancer, but while the protective effect on\nprostate cancer was maintained there was no longer a\nprotective effect on lung and colo-rectal cancers (Duffield-\nLillico et al. 2002; Table 4).\nAlthough the initial finding that Se supplementation\nwas not significantly associated with the incidence of\nbasal-cell carcinoma (Cox proportional hazards model;\nhazard ratio (HR) 1.09 (95% CI 0.94, 1.26)) was confirmed\nin the follow-up analyses, the elevated risk of squamous-\ncell carcinoma and total non-melanoma skin cancer was\nraised by the extended period of treatment to significant\nlevels (HR 1.25 (95% CI 1.03, 1.51) and 1.17 (95% CI\n1.02, 1.34) respectively; Duffield-Lillico et al. 2003b).\nHowever, there are a number of reassuring factors that are\nrelevant here: first, when a treatment lag of 2 years\nfollowing randomisation was introduced, thus excluding\nlesions already in the course of development, the sig-\nnificant effect disappeared; second, when subjects were\ndivided into tertiles according to baseline Se status, those\nin the bottom tertile (see earlier discussion), whose status\nresembled that found in Europe, did not have an increased\nrisk of squamous-cell carcinoma (HR 0.87 (95% CI 0.62,\n1.22)). Finally, it must be remembered that the subjects in\nthe NPC trial were all patients with skin cancer whose skin\nhad sustained heavy sun damage (Duffield-Lillico et al.\n2003b).\nThe Nutritional Prevention of Cancer Trial subgroup\nanalyses. The protective effect of Se was found to be\nconfined to men, both in the initial and follow-up analyses,\nalthough the fact that there were many fewer women than\nmen (319 v. 931) must be taken into consideration (Clark\net al. 1996; Duffield-Lillico et al. 2002). As seen in some\nof the prospective studies discussed earlier, the protective\neffect of Se was found to be stronger in former smokers\n(Duffield-Lillico et al. 2002).\nAnalysis of treatment effect by initial plasma Se status\nin the NPC trial has shown that the strongest treatment\neffect was in subjects in the lowest tertile of plasma Se at\nbaseline, i.e. those subjects whose plasma Se concentration\nwas <106mg\/l at entry to the trial (Duffield-Lillico et al.\n2002). Se supplementation was found to reduce total\ncancer incidence in this tertile by 49% (HR 0.51 (95% CI\n0.32, 0.81)) (Duffield-Lillico et al. 2002) and prostate\ncancer incidence by 86% (HR 0.14 (95% CI 0.03, 0.61);\nDuffield-Lillico et al. 2003a) in the follow-up analyses.\nMost UK and European populations would fall into this\ntertile.\nA significant interaction between baseline plasma Se and\ntreatment was detected such that those subjects in the top\ntertile (>121.6mg\/l) that were supplemented with Se had a\nsignificantly increased risk of total cancer (HR 1.88 (95%\nCI 1.15, 3.05); P = 0.01; Duffield-Lillico et al. 2002).\nTable 4.

P. Rayman\nAlthough this is a subgroup analysis of a secondary end-\npoint analysis and must therefore be regarded with caution,\nit does raise queries about the advisability of supplement-\ning individuals of already-adequate status (e.g. \u2021120mg\/l)\nwith Se.\nInsights from the evidence presented\nWhat lessons can be learned from the NPC trial? It would\nappear that plasma Se should reach approximately 120mg\/l\nto optimise the anti-cancer effect of Se. This level is higher\nthan that previously understood to be required to maximise\nthe activity or concentration of selenoenzymes such as GPx\n(Thomson et al. 1993; Duffield et al. 1999), although ideas\nfor optimum levels have recently had to be revised\nupwards as a result of new findings on requirements for\nselenoprotein P (Xia et al. 2005). Does this outcome mean\nthat the selenoenzymes are not relevant to the anti-cancer\neffects of Se, or do some individuals have a higher Se\nrequirement, perhaps as a result of single-nucleotide poly-\nmorphisms (SNPs) in their selenoprotein genes? This\nissue will be addressed as part of a general consideration\nof possible mechanisms by which Se may reduce cancer\nrisk.\nSelenium anti-cancer mechanisms\nA number of mechanisms have been suggested to explain\nthe anti-cancer effects of Se. These are summarised in\nTable 5. Although there is fairly general acceptance that\nmethyl selenol (CH3SeH) is involved in the anti-cancer\neffects of Se at supra-nutritional doses, as will be\nexplained below, evidence is accruing, some from effects\nof functional selenoprotein polymorphisms, that the seleno-\nenzymes do play a role, particularly at nutritional levels of\nintake. Se in selenoproteins can reduce oxidative stress and\nlimit DNA damage, both of which have been linked to\ncancer risk. Some of these anti-cancer processes or path-\nways are discussed more fully later (p. 536).\nMethyl selenol and its precursors\nThe in vivo production of small-molecular-weight Se\nmetabolites such as CH3SeH that have potent anti-cancer\nproperties has been inferred from work carried out by a\nnumber of research groups (Ip, 1998; Jiang et al. 1999; Ip\net al. 2000, 2002; Davis & Finley, 2003; Spallholz et al.\n2004; Whanger, 2004). The metabolism of dietary forms\nof Se is shown in Fig. 2 (adapted from Combs, 2001;\nRayman, 2004), from which it can be seen that CH3SeH\ncan be formed by the methylation of H2Se as part of the Se\nexcretory pathway. There is also some evidence that\nCH3SeH can be formed directly from selenomethionine\neither by the action of a g-lyase, also known as methioni-\nnase (Nakamuro et al. 1997; Wang et al. 2002; Spallholz\net al. 2004) or by an a, g-elimination reaction (Okuno\net al. 2005). Alternatively, it can be formed from a storage\nform of Se, i.e. g-glutamyl-selenomethyl (SeMe)-SeCys,\nthat is present in plants of the Brassica and Allium families\n(Ip et al. 2000; Kotrebai et al. 2000; Whanger, 2004)\nand probably accounts for the anti-tumour effects of\nSe-enriched broccoli and garlic (Ip et al. 2000; Davis &\nFinlay, 2003). Metabolism removes the g-glutamyl group\nto give SeMe-SeCys, which is acted upon by a b-lyase to\ngive CH3SeH directly (Ip et al. 2000; Combs, 2001). There\nis a suggestion that the b-lyase is present at a higher level\nin cancer cells than in normal cells, ensuring greater\nexposure of the tumour cells to the anti-cancer agent\n(Spallholz et al. 2004).\nSpeciation studies have been carried out on Se-enriched\nyeast, the form of Se shown to be effective in most human\ninterventions. These studies have shown the presence of\nsmall amounts of both g-glutamyl-SeMe-SeCys and SeMe-\nSeCys, dependent on the method of extraction, inferring\nthat CH3SeH may be produced directly from the Se-\nenriched yeast without the necessity of conversion from\nselenomethionine, its major Se constituent (Goenaga\nInfante et al. 2004, 2005). As SeMe-SeCys has been found\nto be more than twice as effective as selenomethionine in\nreducing mammary tumours in rats (Whanger, 2004), even\nthese small amounts may be important.\nPrecursors of CH3SeH, typically methyl seleninic acid\n(CH3SeO2H) in experimental in vitro systems, have been\nshown to block progression of the cell cycle, induce\napoptosis of cancer cells and inhibit the formation of new\nblood vessels, without which tumours cannot grow or\nmetastasise (Ip, 1998; Jiang et al. 1999; Ip et al. 2000;\nDavis & Finley, 2003; Whanger, 2004). Processes by\nwhich these effects are achieved may involve redox\ncycling linked to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, as\ndescribed by Spallholz et al. (2004), and include changes\nin the expression of genes that control the cell-cycle\ncheckpoint and regulate signalling pathways and caspase-\nmediated apoptosis (Dong et al. 2003). For instance,\nSeMe-SeCys activates caspase-3 in mouse mammary\nepithelial tumour cells in vitro (Unni et al. 2001) while\nCH3SeO2H is known to activate initiator caspases-1, 8, 10,\nand 12 (Zu & Ip, 2003). Apoptosis induced by CH3SeO2H\nin DU-145 and PC-3 human prostate cancer cells is\nprincipally initiated by caspase-8 and involves cell\ndetachment as a prerequisite (Jiang et al. 2001; Zu & Ip,\n2003). Caspase-12, an endoplasmic reticulum-resident\ncaspase essential for endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced\napoptosis, is also activated during apoptosis induced by\nCH3SeO2H in PC-3 cells, suggesting a possible role for\nendoplasmic reticulum stress in apoptosis induced by\nCH3SeH (Zu & Ip, 2003).\nReduction of DNA damage\nEvidence that Se can reduce DNA damage comes from\nstudies in dogs and man. In a canine model of prostate\ncancer forty-nine elderly male beagle dogs, physiologically\nequivalent to 62\u201369-year-old men and similarly subject to\nprostate cancer, received nutritionally-adequate or supra-\nnutritional levels of dietary Se as selenomethionine or\nSe-enriched yeast for 7 months (Waters et al. 2005). DNA\ndamage in the prostate was measured by the alkaline comet\nassay while Se was measured in toenails. The percentage\nof prostate cells with extensive DNA damage was found\nto fall with increased Se exposure up to a level of\nMicronutrients through the life cycle 533\nTable 5.

Damage began\nto rise at >1.0mg\/g toenails, demonstrating the typical\n\u2018U\u2019-shaped response to a nutrient that is toxic at high\nlevels. Although the authors claim to have supplemented\nthe dogs over the range of intake seen in US men, the\nbaseline maintenance diet, at 0.3mg Se\/g, gave an intake\nin the control group of 6mg\/kg body weight, already\nequivalent to a high human intake, i.e. 450mg\/d for a 75 kg\nman. The highest supplement level was an additional 6 mg\nSe\/kg body weight, equivalent to a total daily intake of\n900mg\/d for a 75 kg man. It is not surprising, therefore,\nthat the upward arm of the \u2018U\u2019-shaped response was\nbreached.\nIn a New Zealand study of men aged 50\u201375 years at risk\nof prostate cancer (prostate-specific antigen >4 ng\/ml),\nthe comet assay was reported to show a significant\n(P = 0.02) inverse relationship with overall accumulated\nDNA damage in blood leucocytes from subjects with\nserum Se levels below the mean (Karunasinghe et al.\n2004). As the mean serum Se was measured as 98 (SD 17)\nmg\/l, this finding suggests that serum levels >98mg\/l\nare required for the prevention of DNA damage in New\nZealand men.\nWomen born with a BRCA1 mutation carry a lifetime\nrisk of breast cancer of 80% and a lifetime risk of ovarian\ncancer of 40% (Kowalska et al. 2005). The BRCA1 gene\nproduct is involved in maintaining the integrity of the\nhuman genome and helps repair double-strand breaks.\nWhen blood lymphocytes from BRCA1 carriers are\nexposed to bleomycin, a known mutagen that induces\ndouble-strand breaks, an increased frequency of chromo-\nsome breaks per cell occurs, i.e. 0.58 in BRCA1 carriers v.\n0.39 in non-carriers (Kowalska et al. 2005). In thirty-two\nfemale BRCA1 carriers supplemented with Se (276mg as\nNa2SeO3\/d) for 1\u20133 months, the frequency of chromosome\nbreaks was found to be reduced from 0.63 per cell\nbefore supplementation with Se to 0.40 per cell after sup-\nplementation, bringing it to the level in non-carrier con-\ntrols. Thus, Se may have the potential to reduce breast\ncancer risk in these women.\nReduction of oxidative stress\nThe modification of the anti-cancer effects of Se by other\nantioxidant nutrients suggests that the ability of Se in\nselenoproteins to reduce oxidative stress is relevant to its\nanti-cancer effects. Thus, Se intake or status becomes more\nimportant when the concentration of other antioxidants or\nthe activity of other antioxidant enzymes is low. The\nstrongest effect of Se on cancer risk has been shown\namong those subjects with the lowest levels of dietary\nantioxidant vitamins and carotenoids (Willett et al. 1983;\nSalonen et al. 1985; Kok et al. 1987; Knekt et al. 1990;\nvan den Brandt et al. 1993, 2003; Yu et al. 1999), and\nparticularly at low a-tocopherol concentrations (Combs &\nGray, 1998). In the study of Yoshizawa et al. (1998),\nsummarised in Table 2, the inverse association between Se\nstatus and advanced prostate cancer was found to be\nslightly stronger after excluding men with an intake of\nvitamin E >30 mg\/d, mostly from supplementary sources\n(OR 0.29 v. 0.35). Data, as yet unpublished, from the NPC\ntrial (M Reid, personal communication) show that the\neffect of Se supplementation on prostate cancer risk only\nreaches significance in subjects in the bottom half of\na-tocopherol status, i.e. plasma concentrations <21.66 mM\n(P = 0.03 v. P = 0.31 in the top half of a-tocopherol\nstatus).\nA further indication of a link between the antioxidant\ncapacity of Se and cancer risk is seen in the modification\nof the Se-dependent risk by a polymorphism in Mn\nsuperoxide dismutase (MnSOD), the primary antioxidant\nenzyme in mitochondria. MnSOD has an Ala\/Val poly-\nmorphism at codon 16 in the mitochondrial targetting\nsequence that affects the structure of the protein. The\nrelationship between prostate cancer, the MnSOD poly-\nmorphism and baseline plasma Se concentration has been\ninvestigated in 567 cases and 764 controls nested within\nthe prospective Physicians\u2019 Health Study (Li et al. 2005).\nAlthough little overall association was found between\nMnSOD polymorphism and prostate cancer risk, in men\nwith the Ala\/Ala genotype high Se status (4th quartile v.\nSeO2\nO2\nH2O2\n+ O2\u2013\nMethylation\nExcretion\nCH3SeH\nSelenate\nSelenite\nGSSeSG\nInorganic \nSe\nmetabolism\nSelenoproteins\ne.g. GPx, TR, SelP, ID\nSer-tRNAUGA\nSelenoprotein\nsynthesis\nHSePO3 2\u2013\n(CH3)2Se (breath)\n Selenosugars + (CH3)3Se+ (urine) \nSeMeSeCys \u03b2-Lyase\nSeMet\nSeCysDiet\n\u03b3-Glutamyl-SeMeSeCys\nH2Se\nNon-specific \nincorporation \ninto proteins\n\u2022\nFig. 2.

The interdependence of MnSOD, Se status\nand prostate cancer risk implies a role for the antioxidant\nselenoenzymes.\nEvidence from selenoprotein genotype data for a role\nof selenoproteins in cancer prevention\nIt had been thought that selenoenzymes were not involved\nin anti-cancer mechanisms because the level of Se\nsupplementation that reduced cancer risk (200mg\/d) was\ngreater than the amount then believed to be needed to\noptimise selenoenzyme activity (Combs & Gray, 1998).\nHowever, it has recently become clear that optimal\nexpression of some selenoproteins, notably selenoprotein\nP, requires a higher amount, as yet undetermined, of\ndietary Se (Xia et al. 2005) and, furthermore, that a sub-\nstantial number of individuals may have a higher require-\nment for Se for efficient synthesis of selenoproteins, as will\nbe explained later (p. 537).\nIndividuals differ substantially in their ability to increase\nselenoprotein activity in response to additional dietary Se\n(Brown et al. 2000). This inter-individual variation in\nselenoprotein expression levels may be accounted for by\nSNPs in selenoprotein genes that determine the efficiency\nwith which individuals can incorporate Se into selenopro-\nteins (Kumaraswamy et al. 2000; Ratnasinghe et al. 2000;\nHu et al. 2001; Hu & Diamond, 2003). Thus, requirements\nfor dietary Se for optimal protection against cancer may be\nmuch higher in individuals carrying particular functional\nselenoprotein SNPs such as those that will be described.\nCytosolic glutathione peroxidase. Recent studies have\nreported a link between cancer risk and polymorphisms in\nthe cytosolic GPx selenoprotein (GPx1) gene at Pro198-\nLeu. Possession of the Leu198 allele has been found to be\nassociated with an increased risk of lung cancer in\nCaucasians but not among ethnic Chinese, who do not\nappear to show this polymorphism (Ratnasinghe et al.\n2000). Possession of the Leu198 allele also confers an\nincreased risk of bladder cancer (see Table 6) and that risk\nis further raised in men who have one or two Ala alleles at\ncodon 9 (apparently identical to codon 16, as described\nearlier) in exon 2 of MnSOD (Ichimura et al. 2004). In the\n213 patients with bladder cancer, when compared with the\nPro\/Pro genotype, the Pro\/Leu genotype was found to be\nsignificantly associated with advanced tumour stage\n(OR 2.58 (95% CI 1.07, 6.18); P = 0.034 for tumour stage\nT2\u20134 v. tumour stage Ta+1; Ichimura et al. 2004). By\ncontrast, in a case\u2013control study of 399 cases of incident\ninvasive breast cancer and 372 controls, no association\nbetween breast cancer and GPx1 Pro198Leu was found\n(Knight et al. 2004). However, the allele of GPx1 con-\ntaining four GCG repeats was found to be significantly\nassociated with breast cancer risk in premenopausal\nwomen (OR 1.55 (95% CI 1.04, 2.30) for carriers v. non-\ncarriers). Importantly, GPx1 with the Leu allele has been\nshown to be less responsive to stimulation of its enzyme\nactivity by Se supplementation than GPx1 with the Pro\nallele (Hu & Diamond, 2003).\nStudies showing selective loss of the Pro198 allele of the\nGPx1 gene during tumour development, as detected by loss\nof heterozygosity at this locus, implicate GPx1 in the risk\nand development of tumours. The Leu\/Leu genotype has\nbeen found to be almost twice as common in DNA from\nbreast cancer tissue as it is in DNA from cancer-free\nindividuals, while the Pro\/Leu genotype was found to be\nunderrepresented, indicating loss of heterozygosity at this\nlocus in breast tumour development (Hu & Diamond,\n2003). Similarly, DNA samples from head and neck\ntumours exhibit fewer heterozygotes and an increased\nfrequency of the Leu\/Leu genotype compared with DNA\nfrom the cancer-free population (Hu et al. 2004).\n15 kDa selenoprotein. Sep15 is expressed at high\nlevels in normal liver and prostate but at reduced levels in\nthe corresponding malignant organs (Behne et al. 1997).\nIt is located in the endoplasmic reticulum, tightly com-\nplexed to UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase,\nan enzyme involved in the quality control of protein fold-\ning (Korotkov et al. 2001). (The location of Sep15 may be\nof interest as some forms of Se appear to activate endo-\nplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis, as mentioned\nearlier.) The Sep15 gene lies on chromosome 1p22.3 at a\nlocus commonly deleted or mutated in human cancers\n(Kumaraswamy et al. 2000; Kryukov et al. 2003). Two\nSNPs at positions 811 (C\/T) and 1125 (G\/A) that are in\nstrong allelic association have been studied in the 3\n0\n-UTR\nof the Sep15 gene; G1125A lies within a functional SECIS\nelement (Kumaraswamy et al. 2000). The T811\/A1125\nvariant has been shown to be more effective in supporting\nUGA read-through than the C811\/G1125 variant, but less\nresponsive to the addition of Se to the culture medium\n(Hu et al. 2001; Kumaraswamy et al. 2000). Thus, the\nidentity of the nucleotides at 811 and 1125 influences the\nfunction of the Sep15 SECIS element in a Se-dependent\nTable 6.

P. Rayman\nmanner (Kumaraswamy et al. 2000). Individuals posses-\nsing one or other of these haplotypes may therefore differ\nin the efficiency with which they can make Sep15 and in\nhow well they can use dietary Se.\nThe frequency of the T811\/A1125 haplotype is 0.25 in\nCaucasians and 0.57 in African Americans, who have a\nhigher incidence of prostate cancer (Hu et al. 2001). If\nlower levels of the Sep15 gene product predispose cells to\nmalignant transformation in the human population, then\nthose individuals carrying a particular Sep15 gene poly-\nmorphism may be at a greater risk of cancer and might\nrequire a higher Se intake for protection. Furthermore, a\ndifference was found among African Americans (but not\nCaucasians) in allele frequencies in DNA from breast or\nhead and neck tumours compared with DNA from cancer-\nfree controls. The authors (Hu et al. 2001; Diwadkar-\nNavsariwala & Diamond, 2004) suggest that this difference\nis likely to be largely related to loss of heterozygosity at\nthe Sep15 locus.\nAdditional evidence for an effect of this polymorphism\non cancer risk comes from a study of Apostolou et al.\n(2004), which has shown that the A1125 variant of Sep15\nis less responsive to the apoptotic and growth-inhibitory\neffects of Se than the G1125 variant. The Sep15 gene\nwas shown to be down-regulated in 60% of malignant-\nmesothelioma cell lines and tumour specimens in this\nstudy.\nPhospholipid glutathione peroxidase. Phospholipid\nGPx (Gpx4) decreases lipid hydroperoxide levels, and thus\ninhibits the lipoxygenases that metabolise arachidonic\nacid to generate intermediates that mediate signals for\nincreasing cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis (Kim\n& Milner, 2001). In particular, it inhibits 5-lipoxygenase\nand reduces the production of 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic\nacid, which is known to stimulate the proliferation of\nprostate cancer cells (Ghosh & Myers, 1998). Inhibition of\n5-lipoxygenase has been shown to trigger massive apop-\ntosis in human prostate cancer cells (Ghosh & Myers,\n1998). The C718 allele of the GPx4 T718C SNP, which is\nclose to the SECIS element in the 3\n0\n-UTR, has a frequency\nof 0.45 in Caucasians and is associated with increased\nlevels of lymphocyte 5-lipoxygenase total products\n(Villette et al. 2002). Thus, this polymorphism has\nfunctional consequences and may influence the production\nof 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and consequently the\nproliferation or apoptosis of prostate cancer cells (Villette\net al. 2002). Two genetic studies (Hsieh et al. 2001;\nWiklund et al. 2003) have shown linkage of the chromo-\nsome 19p13.3 region that contains the GPx4 gene to\nprostate cancer.\nSelenoprotein P. SNPs have also been identified in\nselenoprotein P, a selenoprotein believed to be involved\nboth in protection from reactive oxygen and nitrogen\nspecies and in the transport of Se to tissues. Normally, the\nselenoprotein P gene is highly expressed in prostatic\nepithelium but it is down regulated in a subset of human\nprostate tumours, mouse tumours and prostate carcinoma\ncell lines (Calvo et al. 2002). Calvo et al. (2002) have\nsuggested that reduced selenoprotein P synthesis occurs in\na subset of patients resulting in loss of protection from\noxidative stress.\nLikelihood of simultaneous and consecutive effects at\ndifferent cancer stages\nGiven the breadth of evidence for the involvement of\nforms of Se in various anti-cancer processes, it is likely\nthat Se acts at a number of stages in cancer development\nand by a number of different mechanisms that may operate\nsimultaneously, or consecutively, involving both small-\nmolecular-weight Se metabolites and selenoproteins.\nDiwadkar-Navsariwala & Diamond (2004) have proposed\na model in which the likelihood of cancer development\nis linked to reduced levels of one or more protective\nselenoproteins resulting from (1) inadequate dietary Se\nintake and\/or (2) genetic polymorphisms that result in an\nincreased Se requirement for selenoprotein synthesis\nand\/or (3) allelic loss of one or two gene copies during\ntumour development. It may even be that exposure to some\nforms of Se provokes cellular stress, up-regulating protec-\ntive response systems (such as glutathione-S-transferase)\nthat reduce cancer risk (V Gladyshev, personal communi-\ncation). Clearly, this very complex area is far from being\nfully understood.\nEffect of selenium on progression and metastasis\nThere are a few indications that Se can have an effect on\ncancer progression or metastasis. Three examples are: (1)\nthe effect of Se status on prostate cancer is greater for\nadvanced disease (disease that has spread beyond the\nprostate) than for primary disease (Nomura et al. 2000;\nvan den Brandt et al. 2003; Li et al. 2004), suggesting\nan inhibitory effect on tumour spread; (2) angiogenesis\nis required for progression and metastasis. It requires\ngrowth factors such as vascular endothelial growth\nfactor and proteolytic degradation of the extracellular\nmatrix by the family of matrix metalloproteinases.\nVascular endothelial growth factor expression and\nprotein levels are significantly lowered, as is the activity\nof matrix metalloproteinases by CH3SeH precursors\n(Jiang et al. 1999, 2000, 2004), while selenite inhibits\ninvasion of human fibrosarcoma cells by reducing the\nexpression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 (Yoon\net al. 2001); (3) the tumour stage of bladder cancer is\naffected by GPx1 genotype, giving indirect evidence that\nGPx1 is relevant to bladder cancer progression (Ichimura\net al. 2004).\nCurrent and future selenium-cancer projects\nThe Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial\n(SELECT), sponsored by the National Cancer Institute at\na cost of US$180 \u00b7 million, is a phase III randomised\ndouble-blind placebo-controlled trial designed to test the\nefficacy of Se (200mg L-selenomethionine) and vitamin E\n(400 mg DL-a-tocopherol), both alone and in combination,\nin the prevention of prostate cancer (Klein, 2004). The\ntarget accrual of 32 400 male volunteers has been achieved\nand final results are expected in 2013.\nThe possibility of raising even one-tenth of the sum\nmade available in the USA for the Selenium and Vitamin E\nMicronutrients through the life cycle 537\nCancer Prevention Trial for a similar-scale trial in Europe\nis remote. However, European investigators are still\nhopeful that a sufficient sum can be raised to carry out a\nless-expensive web-based trial (Prevention of Cancer by\nIntervention with Selenium) with Se-enriched yeast in\nEurope where Se intakes and status are so much lower.\nAs the strongest treatment effect in the NPC Trial has been\nobserved in subjects in the lowest tertile of plasma Se at\nbaseline (Duffield-Lillico et al. 2002), Se intervention in\nEuropean subjects would greatly increase the chance of\nseeing an effect. Equally importantly, it would eliminate\nthe possibility of adverse effects in individuals of already-\nadequate Se status (\u2021 120mg\/l) such as were seen in the\ntop tertile in the NPC Trial (Duffield-Lillico et al. 2002).\nFurthermore, women as well as men would be included in\nthe European trial.\nSe-enriched yeast is currently being used in further\nprostate cancer studies at the Arizona Cancer Center\nat doses of 200\u2013800mg\/d, i.e. the Negative Biopsy\nTrial (Stratton et al. 2003a), the Preprostatectomy Trial\n(Marshall, 2001) and the Watchful Waiting Trial (Stratton\net al. 2003b).\nThere has not yet been a human trial with SeMe-SeCys,\nalthough preparation for such a study in human subjects\nby Ip and colleagues is apparently underway (M Reid,\npersonal communication). As SeMe-SeCys is not a very\ngood precursor for selenoproteins, the results of such a\nstudy would be very informative.\nThe present author and colleagues are investigating the\neffect of functional selenoprotein SNPs on prostate cancer\nrisk using DNA samples from 1400 prostate cancer\ncases and 800 age- and location-matched controls from\nthe Swedish prostate cancer study (Wiklund et al. 2003).\nCareful speciation work (Goenaga-Infante et al. 2004,\n2005) is also being extended to identify low-molecular-\nweight Se species in body tissues and fluids and in\nSe-enriched yeast and plants.\nWill industry allow us to find the definitive answer?\nMuch time has elapsed during which scientists have spent\nincreasing amounts of time and effort in fund-raising for\ndemanding and meticulous studies to clarify whether Se\ntruly has an effect in reducing cancer risk. Industry has\nalready made up its mind and is not prepared to wait. Apart\nfrom Se supplements that have been available for many\nyears, there is now a greater push towards Se-containing\nfunctional foods and fertilisers and the selection or\nbreeding of high-Se crop varieties (Broadley et al. 2006).\nThe worry is that population-based studies will become\nincreasingly difficult to carry out under these circum-\nstances, so that the answer on Se and cancer in populations\nmay never be definitive unless a European-based trial can\nbe prioritised.\nAcknowledgements\nI should like to acknowledge the help and support I have\nhad from my collaborators in pursuing my work on Se,\nparticularly from Dr Fiona Green at the University of\nSurrey and Dr Heidi Goenaga Infante at the Laboratory of\nthe Government Chemist.
