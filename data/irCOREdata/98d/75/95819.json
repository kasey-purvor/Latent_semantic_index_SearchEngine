By looking at the other extreme of (post-)fascist movements, \nit will be shown that the internet also gives rise to anti-public spaces, voicing hatred \nand essentialist discourses. In this article, discourses of hate produced by North-\nBelgian (post-)fascist movements and activists will be analysed. Theoretically the \nanalysis is informed by radical pluralism and the limits of freedom of speech in a \nstrong democracy. The cases presented challenge the limits of freedom of speech \nand of radical pluralism and bring us to question whether being a racist is a \ndemocratic right, whether freedom of speech includes opinions and views that \nchallenge basic democratic values. \n  \nKeywords: \n \nPublic Sphere, Freedom of Speech, Radical Democracy, Hate Speech  \n \n 2 \nRadical Pluralism and Free Speech in Online \nPublic Spaces: the Case of North-Belgian \nExtreme Right Discourses \n \n \nYou think that a wall as solid as the earth separates civilisation from barbarism. I tell \nyou the division is a thread, a sheet of glass. A touch here, a push there, and you \nbring back the reign of Saturn. (Buchan, 1916) \n \n \nIn this article a case study illustrating the way in which the internet serves as a \nplatform for the incitement of racial hatred and discrimination against \nminorities is presented. More specifically, hate speech in North-Belgian blogs \nand an online forum will be analysed. This will be related to recent debates \nregarding the internet and public spaces, rationality versus passions, the \ndistinction between antagonism and agonism (Mouffe, 1999) and freedom of \nspeech. In this article the focus will be on \u2018communities of closure\u2019 (Couldry, \n2002) or anti-publics, \u2018placing themselves at the political extremes [\u2026] \nchalleng[ing] or question[ing] basic democratic values\u2019 (Cammaerts, 2007: \n73).  \n \nAs critical scholars we often tend to focus on progressive emancipatory \nresistance movements first and foremost, and in doing so we underscore the \nextensive use of the internet (as well as other media) by non-progressive \nreactionary movements, be it the radical and dogmatic Catholic movement, \nthe fundamentalist Muslim movement or the extreme right \u2013 post-fascist \u2013 \nmovement. As Kahn and Kellner (2004: 94) quite rightly point out \u2018the internet \nis a contested terrain, used by Left, Right, and Center of both dominant \ncultures and subcultures in order to promote their own agendas and interests\u2019. \nA notable exception to this pre-dominant focus on progressive politics is Atton \n(2004\/2006) who addresses the use of alternative (new) media by the \nextreme-right movement in the UK and the US. Downing et al. (2001: 89) also \ndistinguish between democratic and repressive radical media, the latter \nhaving \u2018neither critical reflection nor any genuine increase in personal or \ncollective freedom \u2026 on the radar screen\u2019.  \n \nInevitably the hate-speech debate also brings into question ideological \ndifferences in relation to the how absolute freedom of speech is, the nature of \ndemocracy and how or to what extent a balance needs to be struck between \ndifferent rights, including respect for and recognition of difference and the right \nnot to be discriminated against. \n \n \n 3 \n2 An online public sphere or public spaces online \n \nThe rise of the internet as an interactive space, potentially global in reach, has \nled to an increasing number of scholars asserting the relevance or indeed \nirrelevance of the internet for the promotion of a democratic public sphere and \nfor the facilitation of deliberation (Wilhelm, 2000; Gimmler, 2001; Dahlberg, \n2001; Young, 2001; Poster, 2001; Downey and Fenton, 2003; Dean, 2003; \nDahlgren, 2005; Cammaerts, 2005). This has clearly re-invigorated debates \nregarding the public sphere and linked to that the potentials of the internet to \nfoster a public sphere or public spaces beyond state and market that facilitate \ndeliberation.  \n \nFrom a post-modern perspective, Villa (1992: 712) describes the public \nsphere as \u2018a discursive arena that is home to citizen debate, deliberation, \nagreement and action\u2019. Deliberation is, however, very much entrenched in the \nEnlightment tradition rather then post-modernism. It points to a process of \ncommunication and dialogue, involving different \u2018equal\u2019 actors aimed at \nreaching a rational consensus. It is thus seen as a democratic process \ninformed by rational argumentative debate, respect for difference and the \nability to change views based on sound rational counter-arguments \n(Benhabib, 1996: 96). \n \nThe internet is by some perceived as an ideal (new) platform to realise \ngenuine deliberation. Coleman and G\u00f8tze (2001: 17) for instance assert that \nthe internet \u2018makes manageable largescale, many-to-many discussion and \ndeliberation\u2019. Contrary to this, much of empirical research on the relationship \nbetween the internet and deliberation (or public debate for that matter) tends \nto counter the rather optimistic claims that the internet stimulates and \nfacilitates the emergence of an online public sphere. First and foremost, \nalmost becoming a disclaimer, the digital divide remains problematic in \nrelation to free access for all (Cammaerts, et al., 2003). True, penetration \nrates in the West \u2013 particularly of broadband \u2013 have soared in recent years, \nbut this does not mean that all and everyone has easy and equal access to \nthe internet or a computer, nor to capabilities in the way Sen conceives them \n(see Garnham, 2000).  \n \nRegarding the potentials of the internet in view of fostering democracy and \nfacilitating public debate or dialogue, Norris (2001: 12) speaks of a democratic \ndivide between \u2018those who do and do not use the multiple political resources \navailable on the internet for civic engagement\u2019. This creates imbalances, \nwhereby those that participate offline, also do so online. This leads Dahlberg \n(2001: 10) to conclude that participation in online public debates \u2018is, in fact, \nboth quantitatively and qualitatively dominated by those already powerful \noffline (politically active, educated, white, males).\u2019 More recently, King (2006: \n26) confirmed that \u2018those people participating in political issues on the Internet \nwere highly educated and already highly politically engaged persons\u2019.  \n \nIn addition to pointing to issues of access and addressing the crucial question \nas to who participates in online public debates, many scholars challenge or at \nleast question the potential of the internet to facilitate and enable (rational) \n 4 \ndeliberation within an ideal speech situation. A recurrent observation is that \nmuch debate on the internet tends to take place between like-minded (male) \nparticipants situated in homogenic ideological frameworks and engaging in, \nwhat Davies (1999: 162) calls \u2018opinion reinforcement\u2019 and Wilhelm (2000: 89) \n\u2018homophily\u2019. On the contrary, ideologically heterogeneous unmoderated \nspaces for debate, while being more open, are often confronted with flame-\nwars between (often anonymous) participants (Eum, 2005; Cammaerts, 2005: \n70). \n \nFinally, some authors also address the dangers of individualisation, alienation, \nisolation and fragmentation, which \u2013 according to them - are increased by \nICTs (Postman, 1992; Gitlin, 1998). New media facilitate the catering to \nspecific niche-markets, characterised by a pull-strategy, which promotes the \nsegmentation of publics, \u2018disadvantag[ing] deliberation and the pursuit of \ncommon ground and undermin[ing] the politics of democratic participation\u2019 \n(Barber, 2003: 45). \n \nWhile many proponents of digital culture and technological advancement \nseem to argue that the internet has all the requirements to be a \nHabermassian public sphere, others \u2013 such as many authors cited above, \nargue the contrary or are more cautious in their assessment. This leads us to \nargue that the real question here is maybe not whether the internet constitutes \na public sphere, but should relate to the inaptness of the normative \nHabermassian public sphere notion at a theoretical level to account for current \npolitical and social processes in highly mediatised and popular culture driven \nsocieties.  \n \nCountering the Habermassian public sphere and rational deliberation, \nConnolly (1991) and Mouffe (1999) advocate a radically pluralist and agonistic \ndemocracy. They argue for an agonistic conception of the political which \nrecognises ideological differences, societal tensions and conflicts of interest \n\u2014 always present in every society, and in which \u2018others\u2019 are constructed as \nlegitimate adversaries rather then enemies. Agonism refers to a struggle of \nconflicting idea\u2019s - \u2018a vibrant clash of democratic political positions\u2019 (Mouffe, \n2000: 16), but at the same time also to a common frame of democratic \nprinciples, respecting \u2018the other\u2019 in their otherness with \u2018a shared adhesion to \nthe ethico-political principles of democracy\u2019 (Mouffe, 1999: 755). The aim of \ndemocracy, according to Mouffe (1999: 755), should then be \u2018to transform an \n\u201cantagonism\u201d into an \u201cagonism\u201d\u2019.  \n \nAccording to the conflictual approach in political theory, deliberative \ndemocracy eliminates or eradicates power and conflict from the political in a \nbid to achieve a rational consensus shared by all participants to the \ndeliberative process.  \n \nI am particularly interested in the role of what I call \u2018\u2018passions\u2019\u2019 in \npolitics. For Habermas, this is exactly what the public sphere should \nnot be; it is not the place where passions should be expressed. (\u2026) \nPublic spaces should be places for the expression of dissensus, for \n 5 \nbringing to the floor what forces attempt to keep concealed. (Mouffe \nquoted in: Carpentier & Cammaerts, 2006: 973-4) \n \nClearly the internet can be seen as providing opportunities for constructing \npublic spaces online, but just as the \u2018offline\u2019 public sphere is deemed \nproblematic on many accounts, so is an online public sphere. By speaking of \nan \u2018online public sphere\u2019 a normative distinction is introduced between what is \nbeing considered good and real democratic discourses \u2013 rational, focussed on \nthe common good, consensual, etc. and what is deemed non-political, titter-\ntatter in the margins or passionate individual expressions without much value, \nthereby \u2018homogeniz[ing] political engagement, neutraliz[ing] social space, and \nsanitiz[ing] popular cultures\u2019 (Dean, 2001: 346-7). In doing so, much of what is \nhapping online which might not seem rational or having an impact on politics, \nis being disregarded. It could be argued that this 'multiplicity of voices that a \npluralist society encompasses' (Mouffe, 1999: 757) is beneficial for a vibrant \n(online) civic culture (Dahlgren, 2005) and a strong democracy (Barber, \n1984).  \n \nThe diversity of content out there needs to be recognised for its political \npotentials and valued accordingly, without restricting or limiting the political in \nadvance. One of the questions raised here, however, is to which extent this \nform of \u2018radical pluralism\u2019 is tenable when taken to its extremes. Ethics and \nnormativity inevitably resurge when confronted with anti-publics; those using \ntheir right of freedom of speech to incite hatred and acting in essence with an \nantagonistic agenda towards democracy and its core values.  \n \n \n3. Freedom of speech: an essentially contested right \n \nIt could be argued that while freedom of speech is considered one of the \ncornerstones of a democracy, it is at the same time also one of the most \ncontested rights. The recent Danish cartoons controversy depicting the \nprophet Muhammad, deemed to be blasphemous by Sunni Muslims, is a case \nin point (Sturges, 2006; Post, 2007). From a liberal and rather procedural \nperspective on democracy, freedom of speech and the press needs to be \nalmost absolute, preventing state interference in determining which speech is \nacceptable and which not (Dworkin, 1994). However, in democratic societies \nembedded in the social responsibility tradition, freedom of speech is more \ncarefully weighed against other rights and protections and considered relative \nrather then absolute (Lichtenberg, 1990).  \n \nThe US First Amendment of the Constitution epitomises the absolutist \nperspective. It states that \u2018Congress shall make no law \u2026 abridging the \nfreedom of speech, or of the press\u2019. Embedded in a tradition of individualism \nand libertarianism, and a firm belief in the need for citizens to be protected \nfrom the state, the freedom to be able to say what on wants, when and how, is \nsacred. However, by protecting the content of all speech in such an absolute \nway, \u2018the action that the speech performs\u2019 (Butler, 1997: 72) is not taken into \nconsideration. As such, fairly rigid dichotomy is being constructed between \nthe marketplace of ideas and social action. Furthermore, the First Amendment \n 6 \ndiscourse has become truly hegemonic \u2013 a dogmatic ideology in itself, which \nleads Schauer (1995: 13) to argue that there is \u2018little free thought about free \nthought, little free inquiry about free inquiry and little free speech about free \nspeech\u2019.  \n \nAlthough freedom of speech is undeniably a highly valued right of any \ndemocracy, it does not take priority over all other rights and liberties at all \ntimes, not even in the US. Anti-defamation legislation, laws against obscenity, \nconsumer and even copyright protection illustrate this clearly. Furthermore, in \nthe 1950s and beyond the freedom of speech for US socialists and \ncommunists was seriously curtailed (Rosenfeld, 2001: 12). Concerning the \nrelationship between freedom of speech and hate speech the issues are, \nhowever, much more complicated. While incitement to violence is outlawed, \nhate speech is protected by the First Amendment doctrine. In this regard, \nMatsuda (1993: 31-32) points out that \u2018people are free to think and say what \nthey want, even the unthinkable. They can advocate the end of democracy\u2019, \nand furthermore \u2018expressions of the ideas of racial inferiority or racial hatred \nare protected\u2019.  \n \nThe claim by Schauer that there is very little free speech about the freedom of \nspeech and Matsuda\u2019s argument that even the end of democracy can be \ncalled for, are not entirely convincing, even within the liberal paradigm and the \nprocedural view of democracy. Popper\u2019s \u2018paradox of tolerance\u2019 is a good \nexample of this. According to Popper (1965: 265) an open and tolerant society \ncannot survive if tolerance is unlimited: \n \n\u2018Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we \nextend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are \nnot prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the \nintolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.\u2019 \n \nThe harm-principle, initially introduced by Mill, himself a strong advocate of \nfree speech and liberalism also attests to the existence of debate within the \nliberal free speech tradition. The harm-principle stipulates the conditions \nunder which among others free speech could be curtailed: \u2018the only purpose \nfor which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized \ncommunity, against his will, is to prevent harm to others\u2019. (Mill, 1978: 9). \nHowever, given his liberal background, \u2018doing harm to others\u2019 has to be seen \nhere in an individualistic sense and does not extend to collective harm. Much \nof hate speech would be allowed, as it is argued that it does not provoke \ndirect harm to another individual.  \n \nOpposed to an individualised and formalised conception of democracy and \nfree speech - detached from action and conceiving \u2018the commons\u2019 as a \nmarketplace of ideas, is the notion of democracy as a process, as \u2018a promise \n\u2026 the endless process of improvement and perfectability \u2026\u2019 (Derrida, 1997: \n5). Democracy is thus not merely a method for decision-making and electing \nruling elites (Schumpeter, 1973), but embedded in everyday life and practices \nand concerned with values such as equality, protection against the market, \nfreedom of speech and social responsibility, leading to a social contract \n 7 \nbetween the citizen and the state (Rousseau, 1977). This more positive \nemancipatory perception of the state has led to a more balanced and \nrelativistic approach to freedom of speech. As such, in many countries a \ncollective \u2013 rather then an individualistic \u2013 harm-principle prevails over the \nfreedom of speech principle allowing for direct (legal) intervention when it \nconcerns racism and discrimination. In addition to this, Feinberg\u2019s (1985) \noffence-principle is also often invoked by advocates of limits to free speech. \nEven within the tradition of radical democracy where a radical pluralism of \nidea\u2019s and voices is deemed beneficial for democracy, a hegemony of basic \ndemocratic values is considered crucial. Echoing Popper, but clearly from \nanother political paradigm, Mouffe (2005: 120) argues that \u2018[a] democracy \ncannot treat those who put its basic institutions into question as legitimate \nadversaries.\u2019. \n \nAs a result of this and contrary to the US, many European countries as well as \ncountries such as Canada, Brazil, Australia and New Zealand have adopted \nquite stringent legislation to counter hate-speech and the incitement of racial \nand ethnic hatred. Some countries also voted legislation outlawing holocaust \ndenial or revisionist discourses. In Germany parties with a fascist ideology can \nbe forbidden.  \n \nFinally, the internet plays an increasingly intricate role in current debates \nregarding freedom of speech. The internet exposes the differences in \nconceptions of freedom of speech across the world as netizens in one \nlocation can access as well as upload content in another location. It has to be \nstressed though that the impact of the global internet and blogs on these \nnational or regional cultural differences regarding what constitutes freedom of \nspeech is both problematic and empowering at the same time. The internet \npotentially enables dissident and radical voices and discourses to bypass \nstate control in countries with an autoritharian model of governance, \ndictatorships or one-party systems such as China and Birma. The increase in \ninternet-filtering by these regimes attests to the potency of the internet in this \nregard1. Similarly, the internet also enables anti-publics to disseminate hate-\nspeech. The focus here is on this other \u2013 darker \u2013 side of the coin.  \n \n \n4. Case-study: the use of blogs and forums by the North-Belgian post-\nfascist movement \n \n4.1 Brief Context \n \nThe North-Belgian post-fascist movement is characterised by a carefully \nconstructed balance between a strong focus on law and order, a populist anti-\nimmigrant \u2013 mainly Islamophobic \u2013 agenda and a call for the break-up of \nBelgium (Jagers and Walgrave, 2007). Its main proponent is the party Vlaams \nBelang, formerly known as Vlaams Blok. In 2004 Vlaams Blok revamped itself \nto Vlaams Belang after a conviction by the Belgian Supreme Court on the \nbasis of racism and discrimination (Hof van Beroep, 2004). \n \n 8 \nWith about 20% of the popular vote on a regional level and more then 30% in \nthe biggest North-Belgian city Antwerp, Vlaams Belang is currently the second \nbiggest party in the North of Belgium. The historical roots of Vlaams Belang \ngo back to the collaboration of large parts of the Flemish nationalist \nmovement with the German Nazi-regime during WW-II (Witte, et al, 1997). \nWhile less apparent now, this is nevertheless still relevant as this dark past \nand its current articulations regularly causes embarrassment to the party, \nwhich incidentally has never unequivocally broken with that dubious past and \nthose that glorify it in the present.  \n \nThree events in 2006 are of particular interest here. In April of 2006, a local \nyoungster was murdered in broad daylight in the hall of Brussels Central \nStation after he had refused to hand over his mp3-player. A month later \nAntwerp was left in shock after a brutal racist murder in the streets of \nAntwerp. A young man with an extreme right background killed a Caucasian \nbaby and her black minder and wounded a Turkish woman. Again about a \nmonth later, a man died of a cerebral haemorrhage after a skirmish with some \nyoungsters of Moroccan descent on a local bus in Antwerp.  \n \n12 April 2006 Murder Joe Van Holsbeek (Brussels) \n12 May 2006 Murder Oulematou Niangadou and \nLuna Drowart (Antwerp) \n24 June 2006 Death Guido Demoor (Antwerp) \n \nThese three events, while very distinct in one way, came to be seen in relation \nto one another, not merely because they happened in a short period of time, \nbut also because of the public debate and outcry, as well as racist discourses \nthey produced.  \n \nSince 1981 discrimination on the grounds of race, skin colour or national or \nethnical descent is illegal in Belgium, as is the incitement of racial hatred and \npropagation of hate speech. In addition to this, in 1995 the Belgian Parliament \noutlawed holocaust denial or negationism. All this is policed by a vigilant \nwatchdog \u2013 the Belgian Centre for Equal Opportunities and Opposition to \nRacism (CGKR). In its capacity of watchdog, the CGKR also started-up a \ncomplaints website for racism on the internet called \u2018Cyberhate.be\u2019. It receives \non average some 30 complaints per month most of which fall into three main \ncategories: 1) racism on discussion forums and chat sites (on sites that do not \nhave a racist background), 2) racist websites (such as Stormfront, but also \nBlood & Honour for example) and 3) racist chain letters or PowerPoint \npresentations (Sofie D\u2019Huster, e-mail interview, 21\/05\/2007). Racism on the \ninternet is on the increase in Belgium, prompting some politicians both in the \nSouth and the North of the country to call for intervention by media \norganisations, the government and\/or by Europe (De Standaard, 2008; \nSchelfhout en Van Den Driessche, 2008).  \n \nIn what follows, examples of online extreme right discourses will be presented \nrelating to the three events outlined above. These discourses were produced \nby individual bloggers or by contributors to an online forum of a US \n 9 \norganisation called Stormfront \u2013 the Dutch speaking part of this \u2018white \nnationalist community\u2019 forum is very active and militant.  \n \n4.2 Racist discourses in online public spaces \n \nThe discourses of hate relating to these three events are quite shocking. The \nexamples below are of course self-selected and thus serve as an illustration \nof discursive transgressions and nothing more. The argument is easily made \nthat these are marginalised voices and ideas that are present in each society \nand now find an outlet on the internet. Given the fragmentary nature of the \n\u2018World Wide\u2019 Web, you will not encounter such harsh and wounding language, \nunless you specifically look for it or are directed to it. Nevertheless, given the \nspecific North-Belgian context where such ideas are at least implicitly \nsupported and promoted by the second biggest political party, this poses a \ndirect threat to democracy itself. As will be shown, free speech and the spirit \nof democracy is also being used against democracy itself and its basic values. \nThe question thus becomes of an even more complex nature; can\/should a \ndemocracy defend itself against such anti-democratic forces and discourses \nand if so, how, in what circumstances, to what extent? \n \n4.2.1 Murder of Joe Van Holsbeek (12\/04\/2006) \n \nJoe Van Holsbeek (17), was murdered by Polish kids in broad daylight in the \nhall of the very busy Brussels Central Station. He was stabbed several times \nafter he refused to hand over his MP3-player. Witness reports, the police, as \nwell as the mainstream media, implied that the perpetrators were youngsters \nof North-African descent and public opinion quickly followed suit, condemning \nthe murder, but by extension also the large Moroccan community in Belgium. \nIn the extreme-right forums and weblogs there was also no doubt what so \never that those responsible for the death of Joe were of North-African \ndescent.  \n \n\u2018I hope finally someone will take the problem serious, and realise that \nthose North African thugs are not worth our care and concern.\u2019 \n(BelgianWanderer, post on Stormfront, 20\/04\/20062) \n \n\u2018That the perpetrators are of (North) African descent isn\u2019t surprising, \nonly the contrary would be.\u2019 (Wehrwolf_VL, post on Stormfront, \n17\/04\/2006, own translation3) \n \nOne quite influential right-wing commentator and ideologue, Paul Belien, \ncalled upon whites to arm themselves. On a collective blog \n(www.brusselsjournal.com) Belien (2006 - own translation and emphasis \nadded), an ex-journalist with strong links to Vlaams Belang, asked to \u2018give us \nweapons\u2019, because he claims: \n \n\u2018The predators have knives \u2026 From a very young age they have \nlearned to kill warm-blooded animals during the yearly Sacrifice Feast. \nWe become sick when seeing blood, but not them. They are trained, \nthey are armed \u2026 The bastards who got everything in our society \u2013 \n 10 \nfree education, childcare benefits, social security \u2013 are today killing our \nchildren for an mp3 player.\u2019  \n \nThis posting shows how at a discursive level a clear distinction is being drawn \nbetween the identity of the self and \u2018the other\u2019, whereby \u2018we\/our\u2019 is being \nconstrued as good and morally just while \u2018they\/them\u2019 are being projected as \nevil, dangerous and even sub-human. The latter is illustrated by the use of \npredator, animals that kill and eat other animals. It concurs with the common \nperception that \u2018positive self-representation and negative other-presentation \nare fundamental argumentative strategies for legitimisation and persuasion by \nthe political right\u2019 (Charteris-Black, 2006: 566). \n \nFigure 1: Screen-Shot of the blog \u2018The Brussels Journal\u2019 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSource: http:\/\/www.brusselsjournal.com (Retrieved 10\/11\/2007) \n \nAfter a complaint was filed against him through the CGKR for inciting racial \nhatred and an interview by the police, Belien removed the above quoted blog \npost. It now reads: \u2018This text was removed on demand of the CGKR \u2026 \nAlthough I deny the charges, I will comply to this request\u2019 (Belien, 2006 - own \ntranslation) \n \nAnother concern being raised by many, including the Belgian Arch-Bishop and \nthe prime minister was the indifference of people witnessing the murder, the \nfact that nobody intervened during the fight that preceded the fatal stabs and \nthat those responsible were able to flee without anyone stopping them. On the \nStormfront forum this sentiment was shared, leading to accusations of \ncowardice behaviour by \u2018the own race\u2019.  \n \n 11 \n\u2018Besides the cowardly politicians, we should also point to all those \nwhite cowards who are present in their ten thousands in Brussels-\nCentral station every day, of whom nobody \u2018saw anything\u2019 or had the \nguts to intervene.\u2019 (Wehrwolf_VL, post on Stormfront, 17\/04\/2006 \u2013 \nown translation4). \n \nIn the forum, vile language towards the parents of Joe, who refused to get \ncarried away by the essentialist mood in the media or online blogs and \nforums, could also be observed. One poster to the Stormfront forum accused \nthem of treason to their own race and of abusing their son\u2019s death for political \nends; \u2018These traitors consciously offer their son to the \u2018multicultus\u2019\u2019 (Duchess, \npost on Stormfront 22\/04\/2006 \u2013 own translation5). Under impulse of a \npolitician of Moroccan descent and the parents of Joe a so-called white (non-\npolitical) march was held. 80.000 people took to the streets in commemoration \nof Joe and against violence in society (De Morgen, 2006a). \n \nTwo weeks after the murder the police revealed that the perpetrators were not \nNorth African, but rather of Polish descent. The Federal police even issued a \nformal apology towards the North-African community in Belgium. \n \nWe regret it that the North-African community was immediately \naccused shortly after the murder, certainly as it now appears that the \nperpetrators are not from that community. (Audenaert, 2006 \u2013 own \ntranslation) \n \nFor some days after this announcement, a discussion was waged on the \nStormfront forum doubting the authenticity of these claims. When it appeared \nthat the Polish youngsters were gypsies, the rant on the forum continued.   \n \n4.2.2 Murder of Oulematou Niangadou and Luna Drowart (12\/05\/2006) \n \nOne month after the murder of Joe Van Holsbeke, a 19-year old Belgian with \nan extreme right family background shot down three people in the streets of \nAntwerp. Hans Van Temsche wounded a Turkish woman and subsequently \nkilled a woman of African descent and the white baby she was minding, after \nwhich he was shot and arrested by the police. This very act sent shock waves \nthrough the Belgian society, not used to street shootings at all.  \n \nGuy Verhofstadt, the then Prime Minister, was quick to link these murders to \nthe extreme right ideology that drives and is being promoted by Vlaams \nBelang. In a press release he stated: \u2018These dreadful, cowardly murders are a \nform of extreme racism. It has to be clear for everybody now to what the \nextreme right leads\u2019 (Verhofstadt quoted in De Morgen, 2006b - own \ntranslation). Not unsurprisingly these murders also caused, maybe for the \nvery first time, real panic in the extreme-right movement. \n \n 12 \nFigure 2: Screen-Shot of the online forum \u2018Stormfront\u2019 \u2013 Dutch version \n \nSource: http:\/\/www.stormfront.org (Retrieved 10\/11\/2007) \n \nThe first postings after this event on the Stormfront forum shared this pre-\noccupation of being associated with these racist murders. Specifically the \nmainstream media was being targeted for strategically linking these cruel \nmurders to the extreme right ideology and having a left wing bias.  \n \n\u2018If this is true, it is very bad. Undoubtedly the leftish press is ready to \ncall Vlaams Belang co-responsible because of \u2018stigmatisation\u2019. \n(Stoerman, Posting on Stormfront, 11\/05\/2006 \u2013 own translation6)  \n \nThe discourses being produced on the Stormfront forum, as in other extreme \nright forums, were very controversial, wounding, insulting and disturbing even. \nSome of the postings I am reluctant to reproduce in this article, as they are \ndeeply hurting and offensive. However, in order to make the case of \ntransgressing discourses, I deem it necessary to include some of them here:  \n \n\u2018Pfff, it doesn\u2019t keep me from sleeping, the only thing I don\u2019t understand \nis why he also shot a white child.\u2019 (Watch Out, Posting on Stormfront, \n11\/05\/2006) \n \n 13 \n\u2018He could have at least taken out a few Jews as well. Antwerp is full \nof\/stinks of Jews.\u2019 (Hidrich, Posting on Stormfront, 13\/05\/2006) \n \n\u2018On moments such as these I hope that that prime minister of ours is \nshot by someone with an extreme right ideology.\u2019 (NSDA-Pe, Posting \non Stormfront, 12\/05\/2006) \n \nThese discourses of hate and even of violence are not only provocative, but \ntransgress several boundaries way beyond what is acceptable in a \ndemocracy, at least within a European and Belgian context. Because of this, \nsome of these were reproduced in the mainstream media, both in newspapers \nand on TV. However, despite the public outcry this provoked, there is\/was \nlittle or nothing the authorities could do about it. In the newspaper Gazet Van \nAntwerpen (GvA), Boonen, from Cyberhate, was quoted as saying:  \n \n\u2018The internet reality is very complex. Stormfront is a good example of \nthat. \u2026 that site, also the Dutch version, is fully operated from the US. \nStormfront Flanders is in other words protected by the freedom of \nspeech as described in the first amendment.\u2019 (GvA, 2006) \n \nThis exposure in the mainstream media, the subsequent public outcry and the \nformal complaints to Cyberhate impacted on the debate in the forum. Some \nbecame scared and sought re-assurances from others in the forum that their \nidentity wouldn\u2019t be revealed. Others bashed the media for its left-wing bias \nand lack of \u2018objectivity\u2019. One forum participant directly addressed the lurkers \nthat came to visit the forum after the media reports. And finally, some also \nresisted and disassociated themselves from such comments. \n \nSeeking reassurances \n \n\u2018Do you think [blocking Stromfront] is possible? I hope not. SF is as a \nsecond home to me. Would they arrest members of this forum?\u2019 \n(Farkasfarsang, Posting on Stormfront, 16\/05\/2006) \n \nMedia Bashing \n \nThis despicable newspaper [GvA], publishing anything except \nOBJECTIVE news, has to be forbidden immediately, they publish \nincomplete postings and thus halve truths. The author of this piece \n[containing quotes from Stormfront], the leftish sewage rat, must be \nhung with his head in the toilet and flushed away. (14Berserkr88, \nPosting on Stormfront, 16\/05\/2006) \n \nAddressing Lurkers \n \nWelcome dear occasional visitor, as you all can see the cowardly act of \nthat one psychopath is being denounced unanimously. Sites as these \nhave thus nothing to do with this whole affair. Of course the press \nwould like you to believe otherwise and the left wants to exploit this \nevent to realise their own agenda. By their bad policies and moral \n 14 \ndecay they have created mentally deranged individuals such as this \nidiot. (Vlaamsche Leeuw, Posting on Stormfront, 16\/05\/2006) \n \nResistance \n \n\u2018I\u2019m sorry, but if the negative comments of some put us in a bad \nperspective, they are responsible for this themselves. If someone on \nthis forum writes \u2018I had to admit that I slept well thinking about that \ndead niggerwoman and that crying Turkish woman\u2019 then he doesn\u2019t \nhave to complain that it appears in the newspaper. How do you want us \nto be taken seriously if you write something like that?\u2019 (NoSugar, \nPosting on Stormfront, 16\/05\/2006) \n \nIt is very apparent that many of the forum participants, as well as bloggers, \nclaim it to be their given right in a democracy to say what they say. At several \ninstances the essentialist and wounding discourses they produce are \nconsidered to be \u2018real\u2019 freedom of speech. This is juxtaposed to a fake semi-\nfreedom of speech, one participant even referred to the Orwellian thought-\npolice (thinkpol).  \n \nThe fascist identity and ideology of the forum is, among others, exposed by \nthis double standard: On the one hand freedom of speech in invoked to \npromote hate speech, but on the other hand those voices in the public space \nthat disagree or counter their discourses, such as journalists in the \nmainstream media and politicians, need to be censored and\/or eliminated.  \n \n4.2.3 Death Guido Demoor (24\/06\/2006) \n \nAgain a month later, an employee of the national railway company died after \nhaving aggressed a young guy of North-African descent in a local bus in \nAntwerp. The youngsters were noisy and arguing amongst themselves when \nGuido Demoor intervened, not only verbally, but also physically, grabbing one \nof the youngsters, upon which some in the group turned on him. Post-mortem \nexaminations showed that Guido Demoor died of a cerebral haemorrhage \ninduced by the skirmish. Humo, a weekly (progressive) magazine revealed, \nhowever, that Guido Demoor was an extreme right activist and that his house \nwas decorated with Nazi paraphernalia (De Coninck, 2006). Witnesses also \nclaimed the youngsters were provoked by Demoor\u2019s aggressive behaviour.  \n \nThis incident again fired up conflictual debates regarding the multi-cultural \nsociety in North-Belgium. One blog in particular was particularly blunt in its \nimmediate and passionate response to what had happened. Vrij van Zegel \n[Free of Stamp Duty] is a blog by Luc van Balberghe. He claims to provide \u2018a \npersonal perspective on the news and asking questions the media don\u2019t \n(can\u2019t) ask anymore.\u2019 (see: http:\/\/www.vrijvanzegel.net\/), thereby positioning \nhimself within the anti-media frame of the extreme right.  \n \n 15 \nFigure 3: Screen-Shot of the blog \u2018Vrij Van Zegel\u2019 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSource: http:\/\/www.vrijvanzegel.net (Retrieved 10\/11\/2007) \n \nWhen the news broke of Guido Demoor\u2019s unfortunate death, Van Balberghe \nposted a very emotional and long message on his blog. Below a short \nexcerpt: \n \nIn Antwerp, every decent educated white person is about to burst of \n(for now) repressed anger. Anger, about vermin that thinks the city is \ntheirs. Anger, about so much powerlessness because every well \nthinking human in this country has to keep shut and bow passively for \nthe foreign leeches. (Van Balberghe, 2006a \u2013 own translation and \nemphasis added) \n \nIn the same post he also uses an allegory \u2013 equating foreigners with ants that \nneed to be annihilated, not by using DDT (a chemical poison), but by burning \nthem, effectively exterminating them. This disturbing reference to Nazi-\nGermany, as well as the words used in the quote above, again depict and \nessentialise a particular group in society as subhuman, legitimating its \nannihilation. It re-enforces the construction of a \u2018we\u2019 - the white population, \ndefenseless, victimised, but righteous, civilised and of \u2018the other\u2019 as parasites, \nanimals, legitimate to be eradicated. In a study of US anti-immigrant \ndiscourses, Santa Ana (1999: 192) identified \u2018IMMIGRANTS ARE ANIMALS\u2019 \nas one of the most powerful and dominant metaphors being adopted. It is thus \nnot uncommon to find such \u2018moral ordering\u2019 in racist discourses (Lakoff, 1996: \n81). \n \nA reader of the blog and prominent member of the youth section of Vlaams \nBelang, reacted to Van Balberghe\u2019s posting by stating: \u2018Marvelous these \nuncensored weblogs that slowly but surely destroy the authority and \npowerbase of the regime-press!\u2018 (Evert Hardeman, reaction to post Van \nBalberghe, 2006a \u2013 own translation), re-enforcing the anti-media frame. \n 16 \nHowever, after newspaper articles (De Morgen, 2006c) and a complaint being \nfiled through the CGKR7, Van Balberghe edited his blog. He replaced the \nwords \u2018vermin\u2019 and \u2018leeches\u2019 by \u2018youngsters\u2019 and removed the ants allegory all \ntogether. Some months later, he posted another contribution called \u2018Next \nyear, a dictatorship?\u2019 in which he denied being a racist, attacked the \ngovernment and depicted the CGKR as resembling the Gestapo.  \n \nIn fact, Van Balberghe, as many others in the extreme right movement do, \nturns the tables on their ideological enemies by constructing them discursively \nas fascists, as a genuine threat to \u2018real\u2019 democracy, claiming their democratic \nright to be a racist. \u2018[They] are a danger for democracy, for a healthy society. \nThey belong to a group that, in the US, would not have the freedom to curtail \nfree speech.\u2019 (Van Balberghe, 2006b \u2013 own translation) \n \nThis raises the question again as to what constitutes freedom of speech and \nhow this should be balanced with other democratic rights. This is not merely \nan ethical discussion, but also a practical one. Where do we as a democracy \ndraw the line between what is deemed acceptable and not, define how \ndifferent rights are positioned vis-\u00e0-vis each other. And then, decide what can \nbe done if these conventions are transgressed. Should something be done \nabout it?  \n \nConclusion \n \nAs has been shown by recent research into progressive movements, the \ninternet allows dispersed activists to link-up and interact, superseding \nboundaries such as space and time, creating subaltern spaces of \ncommunication (della Porta and Tarrow, 2004; Kahn and Kellner, 2004; \nCammaerts, 2005). Likewise, for (post-)fascist, fundamentalist, and other \n\u2018repressive\u2019 movements the same applies. Radical, marginalised and \natomised groups of people, often politically isolated, are able to link up \nthrough the internet in small communities of like-minded, such as could be \nwitnessed in the Stormfront forum. Especially the comments of \nFarkasfarsang, calling the forum \u2018his second home\u2019, were pertinent in this \nregard.  \n \nHowever, in a context where a powerful extreme right actively propagates \nsuch racist ideologies, both implicitly and explicitly, this becomes another \nissue altogether. And it is here that the limits of a radical plurality of voices \nwithin a democracy expose themselves. It is therefore to some extent \nunderstandable that some Belgian politicians from left to right, from federalists \nto nationalists are calling for more pro-active government intervention \nregarding online hate speech, preferably at a European level of governance. \nOf course, given the deeply offensive and repulsive nature of many of the \ncomments being made online and the context in which they were produced, it \nis difficult to remain neutral here; rational detachment is not an option. Such \nvitriolic discourses should make any democratic person angry, demanding \nthat something be done about this. The question remains what that something \nthen is. Whilst laws and regulation or even technical solutions might be able to \n 17 \nremove some of these discourses from the public space, therefore the ideas \nand ideology behind these discourses have not disappeared from the political.  \n \nIt might be useful in this regard to briefly recount Butler\u2019s (1997) work on \n\u2018excitable speech\u2019 in which she uses Foucault\u2019s History of Sexuality to argue \nthat forbidding hate-speech all together through (state) censorship above all \naids in proliferating these discourses further throughout society. This can also \nbe related to what Mouffe calls the inherently conflictual nature of the political. \nButler is not per se against limitations to the freedom of speech, but points to \nthe need to be aware of the difficulties of combating hate speech through \nlegal measures and the practical consequences of this. She refers to difficult \nquestions such as: who defines what is hurtful, offensive, wounding or \ninjurious speech and what is the context in which such language is being \nused? But whilst there might be an overall consensus that the discourses \nbeing discussed in this paper are totally unacceptable and do not belong in a \ndemocracy, not even from the perspective of a radical democracy or \npluralism, the question of where and how we draw the line as a democracy \nbetween what is acceptable within a pluralist perspective and what is not? \nAnd how is this then implemented and enforced? \n \nInternet filtering and monitoring remain technical and policy options when it \ncomes to combating hate speech on the internet. However, active censorship \nin a democracy tends to backfires in several ways. In relation to this case \nstudy, it could be argued that democracy might lose out in two ways. First, \nanti-democratic forces are able to construct democratic parties and institutions \nas \u2018undemocratic\u2019 on a continuous basic, claiming that they suppress \u2018the true \nthoughts of the people\u2019, using in effect the formal rules of democracy to \ndestroy democratic culture - arguing for a democratic right to be a racist. \nSecond, how to guarantee that once a regime of content control online is in \nplace, it will not be used to silence other voices that at some future moment in \ntime are considered to be undesirable by a majority? And do we really want \ncontent on the internet controlled, monitored and filtered on a permanent \nbasis?  \n \nThis is, however, by no means a plea for complacency and\/or ignorance, but \nto carefully think through the implications of intervention to exclude voices \nfrom public spaces of communication and interaction all together. Efforts to \ncombat the incitement of hatred through democratic and legal ways should be \nencouraged, \u2018in order to to secure a minimum of civility\u2019 (Rosenfeld, 2001: 63). \nExposure in the mainstream media of those that produce such discourses and \nformal legal complaints by racism watchdogs are important and fairly effective \ntools for achieving that (except when anonymity is invoked). The \nembracement of censorship of online content by democratic societies in \naddition to this, would not only represent crossing the rubicon, but also \nfocuses merely on removing some of the symptoms of racism, not the root \ncauses of it.  \n \n 18 \nReferences: \nAtton, C.
