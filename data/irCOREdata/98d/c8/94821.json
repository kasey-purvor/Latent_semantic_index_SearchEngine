Harrisb\naDepartment of Anthropology, London School of Economics and Political Science\nbGraduate School of Education, Harvard University\nReceived 28 March 2006; received in revised form 28 November 2006; accepted 23 March 2007\nAbstract\nAcross two studies, a wide age range of participants was interviewed about the nature of death. All\nparticipants were living in rural Madagascar in a community where ancestral beliefs and practices are\nwidespread. In Study 1, children (8\u201317 years) and adults (19\u201371 years) were asked whether bodily\nand mental processes continue after death. The death in question was presented in the context of a\nnarrative that focused either on the corpse or on the ancestral practices associated with the afterlife.\nParticipants aged 8 years and older claimed that death brings an end to most bodily and mental\nprocesses. Nevertheless, particularly in the context of the religious narrative, they claimed that certain\nmental processes continue even after death. This assertion of an afterlife was more evident among\nadults than children, especially with respect to cognitive processes, such as knowing and remembering.\nIn Study 2, 5- and 7-year-olds were asked similar questions in connection with the death of a bird and a\nperson. Seven-year-olds consistently claimed that bodily and mental processes cease at death, whereas\n5-year-olds were unsystematic in their replies. Together, the two studies replicate and extend findings\nobtained with Western children showing that, in the course of development, different conceptions of\ndeath are elaborated\u2014a biological conception in which death terminates living processes and a religious\nconception in which death marks the beginning of a new form of spiritual existence.\nKeywords: Supernatural concepts; Cognitive development; Madagascar; Cross-cultural research\n1. Introduction\nThere is currently considerable debate about whether cognitive science can offer a sat-\nisfactory explanation of the origins, spread and resilience of religious beliefs and practices\n(e.g., see Atran, 2002; J. L. Barrett, 2004; Boyer, 2001; Whitehouse & McCauley, 2005).\nCorrespondence should be sent to Rita Astuti, Department of Anthropology, London School of Economics and\nPolitical Science, Houghton Street, London, WC2A 2AE, United Kingdom. E-mail: r.astuti@lse.ac.uk\n714 R. Astuti, P. L. Harris\/Cognitive Science 32 (2008)\nSome contributions to this debate are distinctively polemical in that they pit religion against\na scientific or materialist view of the world (Dawkins, 2006; Dennett, 2006). However, the\ndebate within cognitive science is best served when competing psychological proposals can\nbe carefully examined in the light of empirical data.\nIn this article, we examine the understanding of death among the Vezo, a group of people\nwho live on the western coast of Madagascar. We aim to show that Vezo hold and act\nupon two different conceptions of death\u2014one that can be regarded as grounded in everyday,\nbiological thinking; and the other that is intimately linked to Vezo conceptions of an afterlife.\nIn arguing that Vezo subscribe to both conceptions, we seek to draw together two hitherto\nseparate and apparently antithetical lines of enquiry. Research by social anthropologists has\ndocumented the widespread existence of beliefs in the afterlife. One particularly elaborate\nand well-studied example is that of the beliefs in the existence and power of the ancestors\nthat are widespread in Madagascar, and well-documented among the Vezo. By contrast,\ndevelopmental psychologists have offered convincing evidence that children increasingly\nacknowledge biological constraints on the life cycle. On this view, a mature concept of death\nimplies the recognition that death is a terminal point that brings all living processes to an\nend. We seek to show that an adequate understanding of how Vezo approach death calls for\nan analysis that simultaneously honors both of these research traditions. More specifically,\nwe seek to show that Vezo subscribe to the continued existence of the ancestors but also\nacknowledge the biological constraints on the life cycle. Below, we discuss in more detail\nthe research in each tradition, and we spell out the research implications of bringing them\ntogether.\n1.1. Anthropology and beliefs in the ancestors\nAnthropologists have long been interested in representations of the afterlife and, in particu-\nlar, in the beliefs and ritual practices surrounding the ancestors. In the evolutionary schema of\nVictorian anthropologists\u2014Spencer, Tylor, and Frazer\u2014\u201cancestor worship\u201d was considered\nas the most primitive form of religion, which afforded the simplest conception of a supernatural\nbeing (for an overview, see Morris 1987). When such evolutionary models were abandoned,\nancestor worship remained a central preoccupation of structural\u2013functionalist anthropologists,\nwho saw it as a central force in the reproduction of the moral, jural, and economic order (e.g.,\nFortes, 1945; Kopytoff, 1971). More recently, anthropologists have focused on the perva-\nsiveness of the ancestors in their descendants\u2019 everyday lives and on how their existence is\nexperienced in different ways and at different times through features of the landscape, objects,\nillnesses, and particular emotions (e.g., see Hardman, 2000; McCall, 1995).\nThe anthropological literature on Madagascar has been dominated by scholarly concerns\nwith the ancestors (for a review, see Middleton, 1999). In addition to analytical concerns\nabout their role in shaping people\u2019s historical memory (e.g., Cole, 2001; Feeley-Harnik, 1991;\nGraeber, 1999; Lambek, 2002), in legitimating political authority (e.g., Bloch, 1986), or in\nmediating conversion to Christianity (e.g., Keller, 2005), ethnographers of this region have\ngiven a rich account of the pervasive presence of the ancestors in people\u2019s everyday comings\nand goings. To illustrate, like other people in Madagascar, Vezo have to follow a great variety\nR. Astuti, P. L. Harris\/Cognitive Science 32 (2008) 715\nof taboos (on certain foods, words, localities, body postures, etc.) that have been laid down by\ntheir dead relatives in the distant past; if they breach a taboo, they expect to fall ill as a result\nof ancestral wrath; if they go on a journey or undertake a substantial new project (e.g., build a\nnew house), they inform the ancestors in order to pre-empt their inquisitive questions; when\nthey sleep, they may encounter a dead relative in their dreams who offers to hold their hand, or\nasks for food, or complains that her \u201chouse\u201d (i.e., her tomb) is dirty and asks why nobody has\ncleaned it. Most interactions with the ancestors are aimed at keeping them at a safe distance\nfrom the living. Tombs are built, announcements are made, taboos are observed in order to\nkeep the ancestors happy so that they will not enter one\u2019s dreams and bring misfortune. But\nif there are signs that the ancestors are angry or unhappy, offerings of food and rum are made\nto try to appease them (see Astuti, 1994, 1995a).\nOn this and similar anthropological accounts, many people around the world, including the\nVezo of Madagascar, subscribe to the idea that dead people maintain a significant presence\namong the living; that they continue to influence the health and success of their descendants;\nand that they preserve a significant capacity for feelings, emotions, desires, likes, and dislikes.\nHowever, in view of Evans-Pritchard\u2019s (1937) famous findings regarding the co-existence of\n\u201cnatural\u201d and \u201cmystical\u201d causal reasoning among his Azande informants, we might want to\nconsider the possibility that many people around the world, including the Vezo, also fully\ncomprehend the biological consequences of death.\n1.2. Developmental psychology and the biology of death\nA great deal of psychological research has been devoted to different aspects of children\u2019s\nbiological knowledge, ranging from the understanding of illness and contagion (Kalish, 1999)\nto the understanding of birth and biological inheritance (Solomon, Johnson, Zaitchik, &\nCarey, 1996; Springer, 1996), from the understanding of life (Inagaki & Hatano, 2002) to\nthe understanding of death. This latter body of literature has focused on the extent to which\nchildren construe death in terms of a larger, biological theory of the life cycle. Thus, it is\nargued that children come to grasp not just the universality and irreversibility of death (Speece\n& Brent, 1992); they also realize that the body consists of an integrated set of organs whose\nfunctioning is essential for life (Jaakola & Slaughter, 2002; Slaughter, Jaakola, & Carey, 1999;\nSlaughter & Lyons, 2003). On this biological conception, death implies a breakdown of the\nbodily \u201cmachine\u201d and the comprehensive cessation of all processes.\nDespite this impressive and relatively early emerging knowledge of the biological con-\nstraints on the life cycle, it has also been found that adults tend to be less likely than children\nto insist on the irreversibility of death, with some referring explicitly to the possibility of\nspecial transformations such as reincarnation or resurrection (Brent & Speece, 1993). More-\nover, studies that have included both children and young adolescents document a progressive\nincrease in references to the afterlife (Brent, Speece, Lin, Dong, & Yang, 1996; Wenestram &\nWass, 1987).\nThese findings raise the possibility that, although children come to understand the biological\nconstraints of the life cycle and to represent death as the cessation of all life processes, they\nmight also come to expect that some of the properties of life continue after death.\n716 R. Astuti, P. L. Harris\/Cognitive Science 32 (2008)\n1.3. Two conceptions of death\nIf we bring together these anthropological and psychological lines of research, one con-\nclusion suggests itself: That children and adults around the world might hold two relatively\ndistinct conceptions of death. On the one hand, they come to understand death in biologi-\ncal terms, and conceive of it as the endpoint of life. On the other hand, they also come to\nunderstand death in supernatural terms as the beginning of an afterlife.\nA recent study by Harris and Gime\u00b4nez (2005) sought to demonstrate that children raised\nin a Catholic environment do indeed hold both of these conceptions. Following a standard\ntest procedure used to assess children\u2019s understanding of death, they asked Spanish 7- and\n11-year-olds who were attending secular, public schools in Madrid to judge whether certain\nproperties of a deceased person remain viable after death. In order to reveal the existence\nof two different conceptions of death, Harris and Gime\u00b4nez introduced two different types of\nprobes. First, children were told about the death of a grandparent in either a secular, medical\ncontext (involving a conversation between a doctor and a child about what had happened to the\ngrandparent); or alternatively, in a nonsecular, religious context (involving a conversation be-\ntween a priest and a child about what had happened to the grandparent). Second, children were\nasked to make judgments about the continued functioning of both bodily and mental processes.\nBoth the narrative context and the type of process influenced children\u2019s judgments. In the\nsecular medical context, children claimed that most processes cease after death; whereas in\nthe religious context, they claimed that some processes continue. In addition, children were\nmore likely to claim that mental processes continue after death than bodily processes. Thus,\ngiven the secular narrative and asked about bodily processes, children generally insisted on\ntheir cessation at death. Given the religious narrative and asked about mental processes, they\noften insisted on their continuation beyond death. This dual conception of death as a biological\nendpoint and a spiritual continuation was more evident among 11-year-olds than 7-year-olds.\nAlthough significant, Harris and Gime\u00b4nez\u2019s (2005) study has two obvious limitations. First,\nit only looks at children; second, all participants came from a Catholic community. The goal\nof the present study is to extend the scope of Harris and Gime\u00b4nez\u2019s findings by exploring\nconceptions of death from early childhood into adulthood and to do so in a non-Western\nsetting. More generally, we aim to remedy a general limitation of existing research on the\nontogeny of religious belief, which has typically examined only a relatively narrow age span\nand included only Western participants.\n2. The ethnographic context of the study\nGiven the unusual setting for the studies reported in this article, we give a short description\nof the cultural context in which they were carried out. The studies were conducted in the\nVezo coastal rural community of Betania in western Madagascar where Rita Astuti conducted\nextensive periods of anthropological fieldwork between 1987 and 2004. The village has, at\npresent, a population of about 1,000 people. The livelihood of the village depends on a variety\nof small-scale fishing activities and on the daily trading of fish at the market of the nearby\ntown (for more details, see Astuti, 1995a, 1995b).\nR. Astuti, P. L. Harris\/Cognitive Science 32 (2008) 717\nFor the purpose of this article, we describe two aspects of the experience of the Vezo children\nand adults who participated in our studies. First, the very direct first-hand encounters that Vezo\nhave with animal and human death; second, the pervasiveness of Vezo ancestral practices aimed\nat appeasing and ingratiating dead relatives. In addition, in order to provide more information\nabout the indigenous conceptualization of body and mind among the Vezo, we also compare\nand contrast three terms that may be tentatively translated into English as \u201cbody,\u201d \u201cmind,\u201d and\n\u201cspirit.\u201d These three terms were used in the final section of the death interview used in Study\n1 as a probe of participants\u2019 understanding of the consequences of death.\n2.1. Exposure to animal and human death\nIn the village of Betania, adults kill a variety of animals\u2014fish of all sizes, turtles, cattle,\npigs, chickens, and occasionally tenrecs\u2014in the course of their daily subsistence activities.\nAnimal death is also part of children\u2019s daily experience from the earliest age. For example, it\nis common for both girls and boys to wait expectantly for the canoes\u2019 return from the daily\nfishing expeditions. When a canoe arrives, children squat around the catch, hoping to receive\n(or steal) the intestines and other internal organs, which they cook on miniature fires. These\ngatherings often turn into something of an anatomy lesson, as children prod the fish, open its\nmouth, inspect its gills, poke its eyes, and so on. Older children sometimes scare the younger\nones by suddenly moving the fish forward as if it were still alive; if the youngsters cry, they\nare immediately reassured that the fish is actually dead; and they are shown that, in fact, it\ncannot move by itself. Children may be given small live fish to play with in the pools along\nthe shore. Vezo toddlers play with these fish in the same way that their Western counterparts\nplay with wind-up toys; but after much squeezing, throwing, and guided swimming, their fish\neventually stop moving. Frustrated toddlers are told by their older siblings that the fish does\nnot move because it is dead and can now be eaten. A similar pattern\u2014play followed by death,\nfollowed by eating\u2014characterizes children\u2019s interaction with small wildlife, such as birds\n(Astuti, 2000).\nChildren are present in large numbers when an ox is slaughtered. Children\u2019s fascination\nwith these larger kills is partly motivated by the hope that they might receive a few shreds\nof meat; but children also appear to be intensely interested in the process of dying itself\u2014\nthey comment on the raucous noise that erupts from the cut throat, on the last expulsion of\nexcrements, on the glassy eyes of the dead animal, and so on. In sum, like adults\u2019, Vezo\nchildren\u2019s experience of animal death is at very close range.\nSadly, the same can be said for human death. In Betania, funerals are frequent (during her\nmost recent 6-month period of fieldwork, Rita Astuti participated in 8 funerals). Adults are\nexpected to participate by attending the wake and two communal meals daily. Indeed, in the\ncase of senior and elderly people, the corpse may be kept as long as 3 or 4 days in the village,\nrequiring people to give up their sleep and normal food for as many nights and days (Astuti,\n1995a). Children are taken along to funerals and wakes where they spend most of their time\nplaying in large voluble groups as they wait to be fed, and eventually fall asleep huddled\ntogether in small groups. Mindful of the decomposing body, children choose to gather far\naway from the stench. At times, they might accompany their parents when they first enter the\nhouse where the corpse is laid out, and they often cry in fear\u2014in unison with the sudden loud\n718 R. Astuti, P. L. Harris\/Cognitive Science 32 (2008)\nwailing that is triggered by the arrival of each new visitor. When a child\u2019s parent dies, just\nbefore the coffin is finally nailed down before being carried to the cemetery, the children, no\nmatter how young they might be, are made to stand in front of the coffin and ordered to look\nat their father or mother and to register that she or he is dead: \u201cDo you see, that\u2019s your mother,\nshe is dead. You shall never call her name again.\u201d As the nails are hammered in, the children\nare ushered outside. They are not allowed to accompany the coffin to the cemetery, as it is\nthought that the dead parent would never let them come back.\n2.2. Interaction with the ancestors\nAs noted above, the presence of the ancestors is part of people\u2019s everyday life. Decisions\nabout what food to avoid, when to hold a ritual, where to build a new house, whom to marry,\nwhen to leave and when to come back, and so on, must take the ancestors into account\u2014the\nancestors\u2019 desires have to be met, their orders have to be obeyed, their curiosity about what\ngoes on among the living has to be satisfied.\nAdults are responsible for keeping the ancestors happy so that they do not interfere with\ntheir descendants\u2019 lives. They are also responsible for staging rituals that appease the ancestors\nand seek their forgiveness when they show anger and dissatisfaction. By contrast, children\nhave no duties or responsibilities toward the ancestors. Nonetheless, they are present whenever\na ritual interaction with the ancestors takes place. Indeed, children are obliged to be present\nbecause the ancestors delight in seeing the expanding crowd of their descendants. However, no\nattempt is made to explain to children what the purpose of the offerings is, who the recipients\nare, how the offerings are consumed by the ancestors, and so on. Adults think that children\nare unable to understand such \u201cdifficult\u201d things as the dangerous requests of the ancestors.\nThey also believe that children are particularly vulnerable to the anger of the ancestors, and\nhope that keeping children\u2019s minds free from ancestral knowledge is the best way to protect\nthem. Parents are consequently pleased to point out that when a ritual offering takes place,\ntheir children are only interested in the food that is being cooked.\nIn sum, although Vezo children have direct encounters with animal and human death, it\nwould be difficult for them to ignore the existence of the ancestors. Yet, children receive little\nexplicit commentary on what kind of entity the ancestors are. By the time they are teenagers,\nthey might occasionally be asked to take a more direct role in ancestral rituals (e.g., by cooking\nthe rice offered to an angry ancestor). When they move into full adulthood, when they \u201ctake\nup house\u201d\u2014the literal meaning of marriage\u2014and have children of their own, the ancestors\nwill begin to impinge on their daily lives as never before, as they are now in a position to take\nimportant decisions that might upset the ancestors and bring illness to their children. As Vezo\nadults would have it, it is only when people have become full persons\u2014by having children of\ntheir own\u2014that they are wise enough to understand about ancestral matters.\n2.3. Body, mind, and spirit\nVezo use three words to refer to different components of a living person: vata, say, and\nfanahy. The term vata is the most straightforward, as it refers to the material and visible\ncomponent of the person. A person\u2019s vata can be healthy or sick, beautiful or ugly, strong or\nR. Astuti, P. L. Harris\/Cognitive Science 32 (2008) 719\nweak, big or small. It corresponds quite closely to the English term body. The terms say and\nfanahy are more problematic. Vezo adults are far from clear about the exact referents of these\nterms and about the exact location of the entities they refer to. They agree that neither say nor\nfanahy are visible, but that the nature of a person\u2019s say and fanahy is revealed in that person\u2019s\nbehavior. In the case of the say, people who behave oddly are said to have a sick say or to have\nlost their say; people who are wise are said to have say; people who are mentally handicapped\nare said not to have enough of it; and children are credited with very little say because this\ngrows as they get older. Children, for their part, use the term to tell their mates that their say is\ninsufficient (i.e., that they are stupid). Because say involves a graded capacity for intelligent\nand socially appropriate behavior, it can be tentatively translated as mind. As for the fanahy,\npeople who are generous are said to have a beautiful or a good fanahy, and those who are\neasily angered or are stingy are said to have a bad fanahy. Once again, children routinely\nuse the term to assert that their best friends have a good fanahy and that their enemies have\na bad one. The same person\u2019s say and fanahy can have different connotations; for example,\nsomeone who has little say, can have a beautiful fanahy. Most adults assert that when people\nare asleep, the fanahy wanders around, detached from the body; and that when people die,\nthe fanahy departs permanently from the body. Insofar as the term fanahy denotes the moral\ncharacteristics of the person and her personal identity, it can be tentatively translated as spirit.\nAccordingly, below, for the sake of convenience, we use the terms body, mind, and sprit.\n3. Study 1\nStudy 1 was designed to answer two questions. First, we asked if the dual conception of\ndeath identified among Spanish children by Harris and Gime\u00b4nez (2005) would re-emerge in a\nvery different cultural context. In the light of the ethnographic observations presented earlier,\nwe anticipated that Vezo children would exhibit a robust understanding of the biological\nconsequences of death for the human body (due to their close encounters with animal and\nhuman death). Nevertheless, we predicted that they would also endorse the view that some\nof the person\u2019s mental properties survive after death. This latter prediction was based on the\nexpectation that children\u2019s repeated, albeit untutored, participation in ancestral rituals would\nafford them the idea that ancestors have desires; that they often feel angry, lonely, and hungry;\nthat they can see and judge the behavior of their living descendants and remember promises\nthat have been broken; and so on\u2014in short, that dead people\u2019s minds survive the death of their\nbodies.\nWe further predicted that this dual conception of death would also be found among Vezo\nadults. Thus, we anticipated that Vezo adults would continue to acknowledge the biological\nconsequences of death while simultaneously endorsing the view that some processes, notably\nmental or spiritual processes, continue into the ancestral afterlife. On the one hand, the ethno-\ngraphic observations show that Vezo adults are prepared to devote huge efforts to appeasing\ntheir ancestors, clearly suggesting that they believe in the survival of some mental properties\nafter death. On the other hand, given their continued first-hand experience and understanding\nof both animal and human death, we doubted that Vezo adults would abandon a biological\nconception of death, notwithstanding their pervasive commitment to and engagement with\nthe ancestors. To probe the existence of these two conceptions, we employed, with important\n720 R. Astuti, P. L. Harris\/Cognitive Science 32 (2008)\nmodifications, the question format adopted by Harris and Gime\u00b4nez (2005) with Spanish chil-\ndren. Participants were questioned about the functioning of bodily and mental processes in\ntwo narrative contexts that focused on either the corpse or the ancestral tomb. As described in\nmore detail below, whereas these two narratives were tailored to the cultural practices of the\nVezo, they were also designed to capture an analogous distinction to that between secular and\nreligious contexts, which was used in the study with Spanish children.\nOur second question was whether there would be any changes to this dual conception in\nthe course of development. On the strength of recent findings by Bering and his colleagues\n(Bering, 2007; Bering & Bjorklund, 2004; Bering, Herna\u00b4ndez-Blasi & Bjorklund, 2005), one\ncould argue that the idea that dead agents preserve their mental faculties is not acquired\nthrough enculturation at all, but is the natural output of a default cognitive stance. On this\naccount, younger children should be more likely than adults to endorse the survival of dead\nagents\u2019 minds because their natural intuition is still unconstrained by the understanding of\ndeath as a biological phenomenon. Hence, the dual conception of death should become less\napparent in the course of development as the biological conception of death increases its\ngrip. By contrast, the findings of Harris and Gime\u00b4nez (2005) showed that older children are\nmore likely than younger children to expect certain processes to continue after death. Harris\nand Gime\u00b4nez concluded that alongside their biological understanding of death, older children\nincreasingly endorse the religious testimony to an afterlife that often surrounds an encounter\nwith human death. On this account, therefore, one would expect a similar age change among\nthe Vezo. More specifically, even if both children and adults adopt a dual conception of death,\nthis should be more evident among adults. Given their active and informed participation in\nrituals devoted to the ancestors, adults should be especially likely to expect mental processes\nto continue into the afterlife.\nTo address these two questions about how Vezo participants reason about the consequences\nof death, a wide age range of children and adolescents (8 years\u201317 years) and adults (19\nyears\u201371 years) were interviewed about the death of a fictional character. The age groups\nwere defined, a priori, to capture the qualitative change in Vezo relations with the ancestors\nthat occurs when people marry and have children of their own (see above). Thus, the 8 to 17\nage group includes the local category of children (zaza) and of unmarried but sexually active\nadolescents (kidabo, somonjara). For ease of exposition, participants in this younger group\nare referred to as children. One half of the participants in each age group were interviewed\nfollowing a narrative that presented the character\u2019s death in a secular context that included a\ncorpse, and one half following a narrative that presented the character\u2019s death in a ritual context\nthat included an ancestral tomb. After listening to the narrative, all participants answered a\nseries of question concerning whether various processes cease or continue at death.\n3.1. Method\n3.1.1. Participants\nA total of 56 children (31 boys and 25 girls: mean age = 12 years, 8 months; range =\n8 years, 11 months\u201317 years, 3 months) and 46 adults (21 men and 25 women: mean age =\n35 years; range = 19 years\u201371 years) were interviewed.\nFor the purpose of preliminary analysis, each of these two groups was further divided into\nthree subgroups. Thus, children were divided into a young child subgroup (mean age = 10\nR. Astuti, P. L. Harris\/Cognitive Science 32 (2008) 721\nyears, 0 months; range = 8 years, 11 months\u201311 years, 3 months), an intermediate child\nsubgroup (mean age = 12 years 8, months; range = 11 years, 6 months\u201313 years, 10 months),\nand an adolescent group (mean age = 16 years, 7 months; range\u201416 years, 3 months\u201317\nyears, 3 months). Adults were divided into a young adult subgroup (mean age = 22 years;\nrange = 19 years\u201325 years), an intermediate adult subgroup (mean age = 30 years; range =\n26 years\u201334 years), and a senior subgroup (mean age = 52 years; range = 40 years\u201371 years).\nChildren in the young and intermediate age groups were typically in either Grade 1 or Grade\n2, having repeated the same curriculum for one or more years. Almost all were functionally\nilliterate. A small number of adolescents had progressed beyond Grade 7, but the majority\nhad either dropped out or was in intermediate grades. All the adults were engaged in fishing\nand trading in the nearby market town. Some were literate, but virtually no one needed to\nmake regular use of their literacy skills in the course of everyday life. All participants were\nfrom the Vezo village of Betania. The interviews were all conducted in Malagasy by Rita\nAstuti and were tape recorded. At the end of each interview, all participants were offered a\nsmall sum of money to thank them for their participation. Monetary compensation of this\nkind is customary when someone seeks information from more knowledgeable people; we\nare, therefore, confident that the monetary reward did not influence the way adults answered\nthe test questions (e.g., by biasing them to give the kind of answers they might have thought\nthe interviewer wanted to hear). In the case of children, the prospect of the reward encouraged\nthem to participate and pay close attention to the story and questions.\nThe recruitment of adult participants posed no difficulties because villagers were familiar\nwith Rita Astuti and with her habit of asking somewhat peculiar questions. The recruitment\nof children was facilitated by the presence of her 10-year-old son. For about 1 month prior to\ntesting, children of all ages were encouraged to come to the researcher\u2019s house to play with\nher son and to draw. By the time the children were asked to participate in the study, they were\nfamiliar with the researcher and her tape recorder.\n3.1.2. Procedure\nBefore testing began, participants were told that they were going to hear a story and be\nasked some questions about it. They were also told that the experimenter\u2019s questions could\nbe answered in more than one way and that the experimenter was interested in the different\nopinions that people might have.\nAll participants received a story about the death of an adult. One of the stories\u2014the\n\u201ccorpse\u201d story\u2014described the death of Rampy; it focused on his illness and subsequent death.\nThe other story\u2014the \u201ctomb\u201d story\u2014described the death of Rapeto; it described him as an\nelder with many descendants and focused on the construction of the ancestral tomb by his\nfamily following his death. One half of the participants in each subgroup were given the corpse\nstory, and one half were given the tomb story.\nThe narratives were designed to evoke two different conceptions of death. The corpse\nnarrative\u2014akin to the secular narrative of Harris and Gime\u00b4nez (2005)\u2014was designed to\ndraw attention to the biological dimensions of the dying process; the tomb narrative\u2014akin\nto the religious narrative of Harris and Gime\u00b4nez\u2014was designed to evoke the deceased\u2019s\ncontinuing existence after death. To appreciate the latter point, note that, although Vezo tombs\nare undoubtedly places for the disposal of decomposing human bodies, they are also the most\nprominent places where living people attend to their ancestors by building them a comfortable\n722 R.

Tombs, in other words, are more than places of burial; they\nare crucial in mediating the relations between life and the afterlife. The English translation of\nthe text of each story is provided in the Appendix.\nAfter hearing the story, participants were asked a total of 14 questions about the viabil-\nity of various processes after death; 7 questions concerned body processes, and 7 questions\nconcerned mind processes. The left-hand panel of Table 1 lists these questions. In the case\nof the corpse story, the questions were introduced by this statement: \u201cNow that Rampy is\ndead.\u201d In the case of the tomb story, the questions were introduced by this statement: \u201cNow\nthat Rapeto is over there at the tombs.\u201d Note that because Rapeto\u2019s body is indeed buried\nin his tomb, this introductory statement does not in any way imply, or endorse, Rapeto\u2019s\nsurvival as a spiritual entity. In other words, the prompts in both stories ultimately leave par-\nticipants free to represent the deceased as either a rotting corpse or as an immaterial, ancestral\nspirit.\nWithin the set of seven body and seven mind questions, there were three \u201cmatched\u201d ques-\ntions. These three questions focused on the same underlying process but the exact form of the\nquestion varied depending on whether it concerned body parts or their associated sensations\nand psycho-biological processes. Thus, with respect to seeing, participants were asked, \u201cDo\nhis eyes work or not?,\u201d and \u201cCan he see or not?\u201d With respect to hearing, participants were\nasked, \u201cDo his ears work or not?,\u201d and \u201cCan he hear when people talk or not?\u201d Finally, with\nrespect to eating, participants were asked, \u201cDoes his stomach need food or not?,\u201d and \u201cDoes he\nfeel hungry or not?\u201d These matched questions offered a more finely tuned probe of the extent\nto which participants conceive of the fate of the body and mind at death as being different.\nR. Astuti, P. L. Harris\/Cognitive Science 32 (2008) 723\nIn addition, within the set of seven mind questions, there were three questions that fo-\ncused specifically on cognitive as distinct from psycho-biological processes. These were the\nfollowing: \u201cDoes he know the name of his wife or not?,\u201d \u201cDoes he remember where his house\nis or not?,\u201d and \u201cDoes he miss his children or not?\u201d Answers to these three questions could\nbe compared with answers to the question about the three psycho-biological processes just\nmentioned; namely, seeing, hearing, and feeling hungry.\nIt should be noted that children were asked one further body question (\u201cDoes he need to\nshit or not?\u201d). However, during the piloting stage with adult participants, this question was\nregarded as too absurd to be worth an answer, and made people doubt the seriousness of\nthe interviewer\u2019s intentions. Hence, it was not included in the adults\u2019 interviews. In addition,\nboth children and adults were asked a question about dreaming (\u201cDoes he dream or not?\u201d).\nChildren found this question confusing because of the close association between dreaming\nand ancestral visitations. Instead of interpreting the question as being about the dreaming\nfaculties of the deceased, children often understood it as being about the possibility of seeing\nthe deceased in one\u2019s dreams. Accordingly, replies to these two questions were not included\nin the analyses reported below.\nAfter participants had answered the seven questions about body processes, they were asked\nabout the functioning of the body considered as a unified entity\u2014\u201cDoes his body work or\nnot?\u201d\u2014and were invited to justify their reply. After participants had answered the seven\nquestions about mind processes, they were asked about the functioning of the mind and also\nthe spirit\u2014\u201cDoes his mind work or not?,\u201d followed by \u201cDoes his spirit work or not?\u201d\u2014and in\neach case were invited to justify their reply. A full analysis of these justifications is presented\nelsewhere (Astuti, 2008).\nEach set of 7 questions was asked in one of two random orders. One half of the participants\nin each age group received the body questions followed by the mind questions, and one half\nreceived the reverse order. Several additional precautions were taken with the young and\nintermediate child groups. First, to forestall the likelihood that they might focus on the final\nnegative option, they were asked 7 of the 14 questions in a positive\u2013negative order (e.g., \u201cDo\nhis eyes work or not\u201d) and 7 in a negative\u2013positive order (e.g., \u201cHis eyes don\u2019t work . . . or do\nthey?\u201d; the negative\u2013positive order does not sound awkward or unnatural in Malagasy). This\nprecaution was not taken with older participants because it was assumed that they would not\nbe prone to echoic responding.\nSecond, the stories were accompanied by visual aids. Children were first shown a colored\ndrawing of the protagonist\u2014Rampy or Rapeto\u2014in a standing position. Toward the end of\neach story, they were shown either a colored drawing of Rampy stretched out on a bed, with\nhis eyes closed, and a white cloth tied around his jaw; or a colored drawing of Rapeto\u2019s tomb,\nwith the traditional cement cross bearing his name clearly visible.\n3.2. Results\nParticipants were scored for the frequency with which they gave a \u201cdoes not work\u201d reply\nto the process questions. We first examine replies to the set of 14 process questions. Second,\nwe analyze replies to the three matched bodily and psycho-biological questions. Third, we\nconsider replies to these three psycho-biological questions versus the three cognitive questions.\nFinally, we analyze responses to questions about the body, mind, and spirit.\n724 R.

Responses to entire set of process questions\nInspection of the data indicated that there were no systematic effects of gender or of\nreceiving the body or mind questions first. Accordingly, an initial analysis was carried out\nin which the mean number of \u201cdoes not work\u201d judgments (maximum = 7) was analyzed as\na function of the six age-based subgroups described in the section on participants. However,\ngiven the small number of participants in each combination of subgroup and narrative context,\nthis analysis obscured the clear differentiation that emerged when the children and the adults\nwere combined to form two separate groups.\nFigure 1 shows the mean number of \u201cdoes not work\u201d judgments as a function of age\n(children vs. adults), narrative (corpse vs. tomb), and process type (body vs. mind). Although\nparticipants said that most processes cease at death, more \u201cdoes not work\u201d judgments were\nproduced in the context of the corpse narrative than the tomb narrative, and for bodily processes\nrather than for mental processes. In addition, children gave more \u201cdoes not work\u201d judgments\nthan adults did, but only for mental processes.\nA three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) of Age \u00d7 Narrative \u00d7 Process Type confirmed\nthat \u201cdoes not work\u201d judgments were produced more often by participants receiving the\ncorpse (M = 12.12, SD = 2.38) as compared to the tomb narrative (M = 9.92, SD = 2.92),\nnarrative\u2014F (1, 98) = 16.25, p < .001\u2014more often for bodily (M = 6.22 , SD = 1.22) than\nfor mental processes (M = 4.80, SD = 2.12), and process type\u2014F (1, 98) = 66.62, p < .001.\nThe only other significant finding was the interaction of Age \u00d7 Process Type: F (1, 98)\n= 11.69, p < .001). Further analysis of this interaction using tests of simple effects showed\nthat for bodily processes, \u201cdoes not work\u201d judgments were given as often by children (M =\n6.10, SD = 1.29) as by adults (M = 6.36, SD = 1.10): age, F (1, 196) = 0.66, ns). For mental\nR. Astuti, P. L. Harris\/Cognitive Science 32 (2008) 725\nFig. 2. Percentage of participants allocated to four different categories as a function of age and narrative.\nprocesses, however, they were given more often by children (M = 5.22, SD = 1.94) than\nadults (M = 4.25, SD = 2.24): age, F (1, 196) = 9.24, p < .01.\nTo better understand individual patterns of judgment, participants were allocated to four\ncategories: those who produced a \u201ctotal cessation\u201d pattern by giving \u201cdoes not work\u201d judg-\nments for all seven body questions and all seven mind questions, those who gave more \u201cdoes\nnot work\u201d judgments for the body than the mind, those who gave an equal number of \u201cdoes\nnot work\u201d judgments for the body and the mind (but less than 7 in each case), and those who\ngave more \u201cdoes not work\u201d judgments for the mind than the body. Fig. 2 shows the percentage\nof children and adults in each of these four categories as a function of age and narrative.\nAs expected, many participants gave more \u201cdoes not work\u201d judgments for the body than\nthe mind (bodily > mental), whereas the reverse pattern of judgment (mental > bodily) was\nrare. Sign tests confirmed that this asymmetry was marginally significant for children who\nheard the corpse narrative (p < .058) and significant for those who heard the tomb narrative\n(p < .034). The asymmetry was significant both for adults who heard the corpse narrative\n(p < .008) and for adults who heard the tomb narrative (p < .002).\nFig. 2 also throws light on the effect of narrative. In the context of the corpse narrative,\nalmost one half of the children (46%) and more than one third of the adults (35%) gave a\ntotal cessation pattern of judgment. In the context of the tomb narrative, this total cessation\npattern was less frequent among both children (4%) and adults (17%). In this latter context,\nthe majority of participants (61% of children; 78% of adults) made fewer \u201cdoes not work\u201d\njudgments for the mind as compared to the body.\nSummarizing, children and adults often claimed that processes cease at death, but such\nclaims were more frequent for bodily than mental processes and for the corpse narrative\nthan the tomb narrative. A substantial minority of participants who heard the corpse narrative\nclaimed that all processes cease at death, but few who heard the tomb narrative did so.\n726 R. Astuti, P. L.

Responses to three matched body and mind questions\nTo compare participants\u2019 pattern of judgment with respect to the body and the mind in\nmore detail, we focused on three questions that targeted the functioning of a body part and its\nassociated psycho-biological sensation (the eyes and seeing, the ears and hearing, the stomach\nand feeling hungry).\nFigure 3 shows the mean number of \u201cdoes not work\u201d judgments (maximum = 3) as a\nfunction of age, narrative, and process type. A three-way ANOVA of Age \u00d7 Narrative \u00d7\nProcess Type confirmed that \u201cdoes not work\u201d judgments were given more often for the\ncorpse narrative (M = 5.47, SD = 1.07) than for the tomb narrative (M = 4.67, SD = 1.49),\nnarrative\u2014F (1, 98) = 9.35, p < .003\u2014more often for bodily parts (M = 2.78, SD = 0.59)\nthan for psycho-biological processes (M = 2.28, SD = 0.96), and process type\u2014F (1, 98) =\n38.40, p < .001. There were no significant interactions.\n3.2.3. Responses to psycho-biological and cognitive questions\nTo assess participants\u2019 differentiation within the realm of mental processes, we compared\ntheir judgments concerning three psycho-biological processes (seeing, hearing, and feeling\nhungry) with three cognitive processes (knowing, remembering, and missing one\u2019s children).\nFig. 4 shows the mean number of \u201cdoes not work\u201d judgments (maximum = 3) that participants\nmade as a function of age, narrative, and process type.

Further analysis of this interaction confirmed that \u201cdoes not work\u201d judgments were\ngiven for psycho-biological processes as often by children (M = 2.40, SD = 0.92) as by\nadults (M = 2.14, SD = 1.00); age,F (1, 196) = 1.52, ns. For cognitive processes, however,\nsuch judgments were given more often by children (M = 1.95, SD = 1.15) than by adults\n(M = 1.25, SD = 1.31); age, F (1, 196) = 10.99, p < .01.\n3.2.4. Responses to body, mind, and spirit considered as unitary entities\nRecall that after the set of process questions, participants made judgments about the contin-\nued working of the body, the mind, and the spirit. We analyzed these data in two steps. First,\nwe examined the effect of narrative. As expected, when judgments were summed across the\nthree entities, participants gave more \u201cdoes not work\u201d judgments in the context of the corpse\nnarrative (M = 2.33, SD = 0.82) than the tomb narrative (M = 1.98, SD = 0.97), t(100) =\n1.99, p < .05.\nNext, we examined the percentage of participants (collapsing across narrative type) who\ngave \u201cdoes not work\u201d judgments as a function of age and entity type as shown in Fig. 5.\nParticipants were more likely to make a \u201cdoes not work\u201d judgment for the body as compared\nto the mind, and for the mind as compared to the spirit, with this differentiation being more\nmarked among adults. McNemar tests were calculated to check these conclusions. Ten children\ngave a \u201cdoes not work\u201d judgment for the body but not the mind; none did the reverse: \u03c72 =\n8.1, p < .01. Seventeen adults gave a \u201cdoes not work\u201d judgment for the body but not for the\nmind; none did the reverse: \u03c72 = 15.06, p < .001. In addition, 10 children gave \u201cdoes not\nwork\u201d judgments for the mind but not for the spirit, whereas 2 did the reverse: \u03c72 = 4.08,\n728 R. Astuti, P. L.

Discussion\nVezo participants often gave \u201cdoes not work\u201d judgments when asked about the consequences\nof death, but articulated different conceptions of death depending on the narrative context.\nWhether all questions or various subsets were included, they offered more \u201cdoes not work\u201d\njudgments when the narrative focused on the corpse as opposed to the ancestral tomb. This\nmanipulation revealed that both adults and children can articulate a conception of death that\nappears to be antithetical to Vezo ancestral beliefs, claiming that when a person dies and his\nor her body stops functioning, all his or her mental processes also cease.\nBoth age groups made more \u201cdoes not work\u201d judgments for bodily as compared to mental\nprocesses. Such judgments were made more often for particular body parts (e.g., the eyes) than\nfor associated mental process (e.g., seeing), and for psycho-biological processes as compared\nto cognitive processes. Finally, participants offered more \u201cdoes not work\u201d judgments for the\nbody than the mind, and more for the mind than the spirit. Overall, these data suggest that\nVezo differentiate between the death of the material body and the continuation of the spirit.\nThis differentiation sharpens with age: Children and adults made similar claims about bodily\nprocesses, but adults gave fewer \u201cdoes not work\u201d judgments for mental processes than children\ndid, especially with respect to cognitive processes such as knowing and remembering.\nIn the introduction, we asked if Vezo participants would conceive of death as both a\nbiological terminus and a metaphysical transformation. The impact of narrative, as well as\nthe differentiation between bodily and mental processes, provide strong evidence for these\ntwo conceptions. We also asked if there are changes in this dual conception during the\nR. Astuti, P. L. Harris\/Cognitive Science 32 (2008) 729\ncourse of development. Contrary to the proposal of Bering and his colleagues (Bering &\nBjorklund, 2004; Bering et al., 2005), we found no evidence of any developmental increase in\nthe frequency of \u201cdoes not work\u201d judgments. Instead, for mental processes, a developmental\ndecline in the frequency of such judgments was observed. Thus, as compared to children, Vezo\nadults were more, not less, likely to endorse the afterlife. In the general discussion section of\nthis article, we consider this inconsistent pattern of results in more detail. Next, however, we\ndescribe the rationale for Study 2.\nThe first goal of Study 2 was to explore whether an understanding of the biological\nconsequences of death is present even among younger children. In part, this question was\nmotivated by the finding of Astuti, Solomon, and Carey (2004), who found that Vezo children\npassed a standard \u201cadoption task\u201d that probed their understanding of biological inheritance\nmany years later than middle class North American children. Thus, it was only at around age\n14 as opposed to age 7 that Vezo children judged that an adopted child would share bodily\ntraits with the birth parents and beliefs, customs, and skills with the adoptive parents. Unlike\ntheir North-American counterparts, Vezo children are routinely exposed to comments and\nnarratives that claim that babies do not resemble their birth parents in their physiognomy.\nTo the extent that their delayed understanding of biological inheritance is attributable to this\ndistinctive and relatively focused piece of testimony, we should not expect all aspects of their\nbiological reasoning to be delayed. In line with that expectation, Astuti et al. found that by\nage 6 (like children in North America, Brazil, and Mexico), Vezo children understand the\nbiological fixation of species kind. They predict that a baby bird hatched from a duck\u2019s egg\nwould be a duck even if raised by a hen.\nThus, because of their early first-hand experience with death, we expected that Vezo children\nas young as 6 years old would understand its biological consequences. Accordingly, we asked\nVezo children aged between 5 and 7 years to judge whether bodily and mental processes stop\nworking at death. To maximize the likelihood that children would display their understanding,\nwe asked them about the death of a bird as well as a person. The particular bird is one that chil-\ndren often hunt and kill. Previous research suggests that the context of predation is particularly\nlikely to prime children\u2019s biological understanding of death (H. C. Barrett & Behne, 2005).\nThe second goal of Study 2 was to further examine Bering\u2019s proposal (Bering & Bjorklund,\n2004; Bering et al., 2005) that young children frequently anticipate the continued functioning\nof mental processes after death, even in a context that does not explicitly prime children to\nthink about the afterlife (as in the puppet show involving a mouse and an alligator that he\nand his collaborators have used). From Bering\u2019s perspective, children\u2019s emerging biological\nunderstanding is slow to trump their intuitive afterlife beliefs. Hence, children between 5\nand 7 years should often expect mental processes to continue functioning after death even\nif they acknowledge that bodily processes cease to operate. By contrast, if children come\nto differentiate between the fate of bodily and mental processes at death as a result of their\nemerging understanding of relevant ritual practices, younger children with fewer insights into\nthose rituals would be unlikely to differentiate between bodily and mental processes.\nIn sum, Study 2 was designed to examine young children\u2019s understanding of the biology\nof death and their differentiation between bodily and mental processes. Children aged 5 to 7\nyears were given two tasks\u2014one about the death of a man and one about the death of a bird.\nIn each case, they were given a set of 14 questions, similar to those employed in Study 1.\n730 R. Astuti, P. L. Harris\/Cognitive Science 32 (2008)\n4. Study 2\n4.1. Method\n4.1.1. Participants\nA total of 34 children (15 boys and 19 girls) divided into two age groups was included\nin the final study: eighteen 5-year-olds (mean age = 5 years 9, months; range = 5 years, 6\nmonths\u20136 years, 6 months) and sixteen 7-year-olds (mean age = 7 years, 1 month; range = 6\nyears, 9 months\u20137 years, 7 months). A further 5 children (all younger children) were excluded\nbecause they failed the control questions (described below). Two older children were excluded\nbecause, despite completing the first task, they could not be interviewed for the second task.\nChildren were again recruited from the Vezo village of Betania.\n4.1.2. Procedure\nAll participants were administered two tasks. In the \u201cperson\u201d task, children were shown a\ncolored drawing of a man named Rapeto in a standing position. In the \u201cbird\u201d task, children\nwere shown a colored drawing of a bird diving into the sea. In each case, children were asked\nseveral warm-up questions such as, \u201cIs Rapeto sitting or not?,\u201d or \u201cIs this bird flying or not?\u201d;\ncalling for a mix of negative and positive answers. When the researcher was satisfied that the\nchild was at ease, she introduced a new drawing, announcing that either Rapeto or the bird\nhad died the previous day. The drawing of the dead Rapeto was the same as the one used in\nStudy 1; the drawing of the dead bird depicted a bird flat on the sand with limp neck and\nwings. Children were asked whether they could tell that the man or the bird was indeed dead;\nand when they agreed, they were given the test questions.\nThe processes probed in the two tasks were the same, as shown in the left- and right-hand\npanels of Table 1. For one of the seven mental questions used in the person task (\u201cDoes it\nmiss his children?\u201d) a close match was difficult to find for use in the bird task. Accordingly,\na more plausible question (\u201cDoes it feel afraid?\u201d) was devised.\nIn all other respects, the design of the person and bird tasks was identical to that used in\nStudy 1, except that one additional precaution was included. In addition to the 14 process\nquestions and three questions about the body, mind, and spirit, children were asked a total of\nfive control questions. Each control question was phrased such that a correct answer called\nfor a positive reply\u2014in contrast to the test questions where a biologically informed answer\ncalled for a negative reply. The control questions were introduced to check for perseverative\nresponding. A total of 5 children (all in the younger group) failed more than one control\nquestion and were excluded.\nOne half of the children were first presented with the person task followed by the bird task,\nand the other half were first presented with the bird task followed by the person task. The two\ntasks were administered at a week\u2019s interval from one another.\n4.2.

A four-way ANOVA of Age \u00d7 Target Order \u00d7 Target \u00d7 Process Type\nproduced a single main effect and no interactions. The main effect of age, F (1, 30) = 17.32,\np < .001, confirmed that when the entire set of 28 questions was examined, \u201cdoes not work\u201d\njudgments were made more often by older children (M = 22.38, SD = 2.58) than by younger\nchildren (M = 14.23, SD = 7.04).\nTo assess whether children\u2019s replies deviated from chance, t tests were calculated comparing\ntheir total score across all 28 questions (combining replies for bird and person) to the chance\nexpectation of 14.

A four-way ANOVA of Age \u00d7 Target Order \u00d7 Target \u00d7 Process\nType also produced only a single main effect and no interactions. The main effect of age, F (1,\n30) = 20.22, p < .001, confirmed that \u201cdoes not work\u201d judgments were made more often by\nolder children (M = 10.88, SD = 1.15) than by younger children (M = 6.78 , SD = 3.30).\nTwo t tests again confirmed that older children gave more \u201cdoes not work\u201d judgments than\nwould be expected by chance (i.e., 6), t(15) = 16.99, p < .001; whereas younger children\nwere at chance, t(17) = 1.00, ns.\nWe also compared children\u2019s replies concerning three psycho-biological processes (seeing,\nhearing, and feeling hungry) and two cognitive processes (knowing and remembering). (The\n732 R. Astuti, P. L.

A four-way\nANOVA of Age \u00d7 Target Order \u00d7 Target \u00d7 Process Type produced a main effect of age, F (1,\n30) = 13.93, p < .001, confirming that, irrespective of process type, \u201cdoes not work\u201d judg-\nments were produced more often by older children (M = 10.53, SD = 1.78) than by younger\nchildren (M = 6.25 , SD = 4.13). The only other significant result was an uninterpretable\nthree-way interaction of Age \u00d7 Target Order \u00d7 Process Type: F (1, 30) = 5.34, p < .028.\nTwo t tests confirmed that, overall, older children gave more \u201cdoes not work\u201d judgments than\nwould be expected by chance (i.e., 6), t(15) = 10.16, p < .001; whereas younger children\nwere at chance, t(17) = 0.26, ns.\nFinally, we examined the frequency with which participants gave \u201cdoes not work\u201d judg-\nments for each of the three entities\u2014body, mind, and spirit. Preliminary inspection confirmed\nthat (in contrast to the older children and adults interviewed in Study 1) children gave a\nsimilar number of \u201cdoes not work\u201d replies for each of the three entities. Accordingly, their\nreplies were summed across these three entities.

Discussion\nThe results of Study 2 show that there is a marked age change between 5 and 7 years among\nVezo children. Across four different analyses, 7-year-olds consistently gave more \u201cdoes not\nwork\u201d answers than did 5-year-olds. In addition, 7-year-olds consistently gave more such\nanswers than would be expected by chance. By contrast, 5-year-olds children were at chance.\nThis age change held for bodily and mental processes alike. Moreover, despite their systematic\nperformance, 7-year-olds made no differentiation between the two types of processes.\nThese findings show that 7-year-old Vezo children have a relatively coherent conception of\nboth human and animal death. Children\u2019s performance is in line with the findings reported in\nAstuti et al. (2004), showing that by approximately 6 years of age, Vezo children understand\nthe biological process of species fixation, even if they take several more years to understand\nthe biological inheritance of individual traits. Thus, by age 7, Vezo children have mastered\nseveral key components of the biology of the life cycle. They claim that death brings virtually\nall processes\u2014whether connected to the body or the mind\u2014to a halt. We turn next to a more\nwide-ranging discussion of the two studies combined.\n5. General discussion\nWe first consider the findings in relation to our two main goals: to study conceptions of death\nin a non-Western setting and to describe the development of those conceptions from early\nchildhood through adulthood. We then examine our findings in relation to other recent reports\nof the development of afterlife beliefs. Finally, we indicate future directions for research.\nStudy 1 was designed to probe whether Vezo participants would modulate their inferences\nabout the fate of the deceased depending on the narrative context. Both children and adults\nwere less likely to judge that some processes continue after death when asked to listen to a\ncorpse narrative that focused on the illness and subsequent death of a fictional character than\nwhen asked to listen to a tomb narrative that focused on the tomb and the rituals associated\nwith the ancestors. Most strikingly, when presented with the corpse narrative, a substantial\nminority of children and adults claimed that all functions cease at death. Such a nihilist stance\nwas much rarer in the context of the tomb narrative.\nThe most plausible interpretation of this highly regular effect of narrative is that Vezo have\nrecourse to two different conceptions of death. Guided by their everyday observation of death\nacross various species, they construe it in biological terms as the breakdown of vital functions.\nGuided by their involvement in ancestral rituals and practices, they construe death as the\nbeginning of a different form of existence, one that is not obviously tied to bodily processes\nbut includes at least some mental processes such as remembering; wanting; feeling displeased,\nangry, or placated.\nAlthough such different conceptions might be regarded as objectively incompatible with\none another, it is unlikely that Vezo experience tension or inconsistency. Each conception is\nlikely to be activated in different, non-overlapping circumstances. For example, when people\nare confronted with a dead person, they will consider it at one moment as a corpse and at\nanother moment as an ancestor, behaving accordingly toward it. When they wash and prepare\n734 R. Astuti, P. L. Harris\/Cognitive Science 32 (2008)\nthe corpse, Vezo treat it as a non-sentient entity. The body is washed with cold water because\n\u201cit can\u2019t feel anything,\u201d and the entangled hair is pulled and yanked because \u201cshe no longer\nfeels any pain.\u201d But when the children are shown the face of their dead parent for the last time\nand told never to call his or her name again, the dead person is treated as a sentient being\ncapable of returning to, and interfering with, the everyday life of the community (for further\nethnographic details, see Astuti, 2007).\nThe finding that such different conceptions of death coexist in people\u2019s minds raises impor-\ntant questions about the study of belief. Anthropologists routinely attribute a range of beliefs\n(in ancestors, witches, gods, etc.) on the basis of their informants\u2019 statements and actions. For\nexample, considering the large amount of time and resources that Vezo spend to honor and\nappease the ancestors, or the anxiety that is generated by ancestral dreams, an anthropologist\nmight reasonably infer that Vezo believe in the existence and power of ancestral spirits. But\nhow do they exactly?\nThe findings of the present study\u2014as did the findings of Harris and Gime\u00b4nez (2005)\u2014\nprovide us with a more complicated answer than is normally available to anthropologists. Vezo\ndo not believe in the existence and power of the ancestors in the abstract, but they believe\nin them when their attention is on tombs that have to be built, on dreams that have to be\ninterpreted, and on illnesses that have to be explained and resolved. In other contexts, death\nis represented as a total annihilation, and in these contexts it would be misleading to insist\nthat Vezo believe in the existence of ancestral spirits. This does not make their belief in the\npower of the ancestors any less compelling. Instead, it shows that the belief in the power of\nthe ancestors needs to be studied in terms of when a given conception of death is activated,\nrather than in terms of whether a belief in the ancestors is or is not held.\nOur second goal was to set out a relatively comprehensive description of the development\nof Vezo ideas about death from childhood through adulthood. Combining the findings from\nStudies 1 and 2, it is possible to discern three periods or stages. First, very young children\ndisplay no systematic pattern of judgment about what processes continue to function after\ndeath. Subsequently, at around 7 years of age, children claim that most processes cease to\nfunction. They make no distinction, in this regard, between bodily and mental processes. This\nconception of death as a general cessation of functioning replicates a pattern of development\nthat is well established among Western children (Slaughter et al., 1999), as noted in the\nintroduction. Finally, older Vezo children and adults differentiate between bodily and mental\nprocesses. Irrespective of narrative context, they are more likely to claim that mental processes\ncontinue after death. At the same time, they are less likely to claim that processing comes to a\nhalt if they are presented with an ancestral as opposed to a biological narrative. Taken together,\nthe impact of both process type and narrative suggest that older children and adults adopt a\ndual conception of death. They either emphasize the cessation of processing\u2014consistent with\na biological conception\u2014or the continuation of processing\u2014consistent with a belief in the\nafterlife. This dual conception is found among older children but is more sharply evident\namong adults. These findings replicate and extend earlier research with Spanish children\ngrowing up in a predominantly Catholic environment (Harris & Gime\u00b4nez, 2005).\nWe first consider two caveats to this developmental narrative before discussing its broader\nimplications. First, despite their unsystematic replies during the interview of Study 2, Vezo\n5-year-olds might possess more biological understanding of death than they revealed. At this\nR. Astuti, P. L. Harris\/Cognitive Science 32 (2008) 735\nage, Vezo children have little experience of entering into a sustained dialogue with adults, and\nthey are generally very shy in answering any kind of questions even when they are quizzed\nby their own parents. Yet, as described in the introduction, they have typically had frequent,\ndirect encounters with death. Thus, particularly in light of the recent report by H. C. Barrett\nand Behne (2005) showing that Shuar and German 4- and 5-year-olds distinguish the effects\nof being killed versus sleeping when provided with very explicit predation cues, our findings\nfor Vezo 5-year-olds should be treated with caution. Admittedly, when Rita Astuti attempted\na replication of H. C. Barrett and Behne\u2019s protocol with Vezo 4-year-olds (using wooden\nfigures to enact a cat preying on a mouse), she failed to elicit replies, irrespective of who did\nthe questioning (herself, a young Vezo man, the children\u2019s own parent). Nonetheless, these\nnegative results may conceal an early understanding of the consequences of death.\nSecond, the 7-year-olds in Study 2 made no distinction between mental and bodily pro-\ncesses, consistent with a biological conception of death as the cessation of all processes.\nHowever, it is possible that they might claim that some processes, particularly mental pro-\ncesses, continue after death, if they were prompted to conceptualize a human death in terms\nof the ancestral rituals that normally surround it. Pending further investigation, the exact point\nat which children adopt two different conceptions of death remains to be established.\nTurning to the wider implications of our developmental findings, we consider the finding\nthat the differentiation between the two conceptions of death is more evident among adults than\nchildren. One possibility is that the two different conceptions follow separate and autonomous\ntrajectories. In particular, it could be maintained that children do not need to understand that\ndeath brings to an end the organism\u2019s vital functions in order to learn that dead people continue\nto miss their children, that they are angry if they are forgotten, and happy if a new tomb is\nbuilt for them. Indeed, one could argue that ignorance of the biological consequences of death\nactually facilitates children\u2019s assimilation of their elders\u2019 representations of the afterlife. As\nsuggested by J. L. Barrett (Barrett, Richert, & Driesenga, 2001) in the context of a study of\nWestern children\u2019s understanding of the omniscience of God, children who do not understand\nthe limitations of mortal human beings find it easy to accept the extraordinary qualities\nof supernatural entities. However, we may also consider an alternative line of argument,\ncompatible with Boyer\u2019s (2001) characterization of religious concepts as \u201ccounterintuitive.\u201d\nChildren may be in a better position to learn about the afterlife after they have consolidated\ntheir biological understanding of death. More specifically, ideas about the afterlife may be\nmore cognitively salient when they constitute an apparent violation of children\u2019s consolidated,\nbiological intuitions.\nThe data from our studies fit this latter line of argument. Consistent with a biological\nconception of death, the 7-year-olds in Study 2 reasoned that both in the case of a bird\nand a person, most processes, whether bodily or mental, cease at death. By contrast, the\nolder children who participated in Study 1, with an average age of 12 years, claimed that\nsome processes, especially mental processes, continue after death. This claim regarding the\ncontinued functioning of mental processes was even more evident among adults. Thus, we\nconclude that a belief in the afterlife is especially likely to emerge against the backdrop of a\nconsolidated understanding of death as a biological terminus.\nHow far are our conclusions and interpretations consistent with other recent research on\nafterlife beliefs and their development? A robust finding, both in Study 1 and in the earlier\n736 R. Astuti, P. L. Harris\/Cognitive Science 32 (2008)\nreport of Harris and Gime\u00b4nez (2005), was that participants are more likely to acknowledge the\ncontinued functioning of mental as compared to bodily processes after death. Bering and his\ncolleagues (Bering, 2002; Bering & Bjorklund, 2004; Bering et al., 2005) reported a similar\ndifferentiation between mind and body. Across several experiments, participants were more\nlikely to assert the continued functioning of mental (e.g., feeling desires or emotions) as\ncompared to biological (e.g., brain functioning) or psychobiological processes (e.g., feeling\nsick).\nNevertheless, Bering and his colleagues (Bering, 2007; Bering & Bjorklund, 2004) inter-\npreted these results differently. They proposed that children\u2019s expectation that mental processes\ncontinue to function after death is the natural output of a default cognitive stance; it is not ini-\ntially acquired through enculturation. Moreover, they predicted a developmental inhibition of\nthis default stance: \u201cAs children develop, they tend to acquire biological knowledge, and they\nlikely apply this knowledge when reasoning about the psychological status of dead agents\u201d\n(Bering & Bjorklund, 2004, p. 218). Thus, children should increasingly acknowledge that\nmental as well bodily processes cease at death. This account effectively predicts, therefore,\nthat the gap between judgments about mental as compared to biological processes will wane\nor completely disappear, as the biological concept of death is increasingly applied not just\nto biological processes but also to mental processes. Our findings indicate, by contrast, that\nthe gap between body and mind becomes more evident in the course of development, as the\nbiological fate of the body is increasingly differentiated from that of the mind or spirit. Recall\nthat no differentiation between body and mind was made by 5- or 7-year-olds in Study 2. Note\nalso that, although 5-year-olds made fewer \u201cdoes not work\u201d judgments than 7-year-olds, this\nmay be plausibly attributed to their unsystematic pattern of replies and not to any early belief\nin the afterlife.\nIndeed, close scrutiny of the findings of Bering and his colleagues also suggests that the\ndifferentiation between mind and body either persists (Bering et al., 2005) or increases from\n5 to 12 years (Bering & Bjorklund, 2004; Experiment 2) and is strongly evident among adults\n(Bering, 2002). Moreover, consistent with our emphasis on the role of religious testimony,\nSpanish children attending Catholic schools were more likely than those attending secular\nschools to eschew a consistently biological stance, with this effect of schooling being especially\nmarked among the oldest children (Bering et al., 2005). Finally, adult judgments about the\ncessation or continuation of mental processes at death are significantly correlated with their\nself-reported beliefs in an afterlife (Bering, 2002). Thus, whatever the exact explanation for\nthe origin of children\u2019s belief in the continued functioning of mental processes at death,\nwe conclude that there is little support for the prediction that such beliefs disappear as the\nbiological conception of death extends its grip. To the contrary, there is considerable support\nfor the proposal that exposure to religious practices and teaching, whether Christian or non-\nChristian, enhances the expectation that mental processes continue after death.\nThe finding of Bering and his colleagues (Bering & Bjorklund, 2004) that young children\ndifferentiate between the fate of bodily as compared to mental processes has been used by\nBloom (2004) to support his claim that humans are natural dualists. On Bloom\u2019s account, the\nearly emerging \u201cbelief in the afterlife is a natural consequence of our [Homo Sapiens] intuitive\nCartesian perspective\u201d (p. 207). Thus, Bloom suggested that as soon as children learn about\nthe inevitable destruction of their body, the notion of an afterlife will come to them naturally.\nR. Astuti, P. L. Harris\/Cognitive Science 32 (2008) 737\nOur data do not bear on the hypothesis that humans are natural dualists, but they do suggest\nthat any conversion of early dualism into a belief in the afterlife is not automatic. Given\nparticipants\u2019 sensitivity to the ancestral narrative, it appears to be sustained by an awareness\nof ritual practices.\nOur proposals indicate two important directions for future research. We have argued for the\nexistence of two conceptions of death, but is one of them more basic or automatic? The design\nof Study 1 was based on a simple narrative manipulation that was likely to equate the cognitive\ndemand of retrieving and using either conception. However, following J. L. Barrett\u2019s (1999)\ndistinction between basic as compared to \u201ctheologically correct\u201d concepts, and Sperber\u2019s\n(1997) distinction between intuitive and reflective beliefs, one could test whether, in a cog-\nnitively demanding task that forces participants to reason quickly and on-the-fly, Vezo might\npreferentially access one of the two conceptions, perhaps irrespective of any narrative priming\nthey receive. If so, this would indicate that the other conception requires more effort, a certain\namount of conscious reflection, and the mobilization of theologically correct and explicitly\nheld reflective beliefs. We are inclined to predict that, if there is a difference at all, the less\ncognitively demanding, more basic, or intuitive conception will be that of death as annihilation.\nWe have speculated that Vezo children learn that a person\u2019s spirit survives the death of his\nor her body against the backdrop of their understanding of death as the biological breakdown\nof the living organism. It should be feasible to test this developmental claim more directly.\nRecent research shows that children\u2019s biological knowledge can be consolidated following a\nbrief intervention in which they are offered explicit information about the critical role played\nby internal body parts (Slaughter & Lyons, 2003). If our speculation is correct, children who\nbenefit from such an intervention should subsequently be more receptive to claims about the\ncontinuity of mental processes in the afterlife as compared to control children who receive\nno such intervention. Thus, an appreciation of the biological finality of death may prime\nchildren\u2019s sensitivity to claims of a spiritual afterlife.\nIn conclusion, we note that our findings are relevant to a broader debate about the na-\nture of cognitive development. Particularly in the context of research on the acceptance and\nunderstanding of evolutionary theory, it has been argued that early emerging assumptions\nabout teleological design may impede a full understanding of the evidence in favor of natural\nselection (Mayr, 2001; Shtulman, 2006). More generally, it is often assumed that children\u2019s\nearly theorizing stands in the way of a comprehensive acceptance of scientific theories and\ntheir implications (Gardner, 1991; Harris & Koenig, 2006). However, the relationship be-\ntween earlier and later concepts may be more varied and complicated. If our analysis is\ncorrect, children\u2019s biological conception of death, even if it is not a fully scientific theory,\nis grounded in a coherent, empirically based concept of the life cycle that informs their\nunderstanding of species fixation and developmental growth, as well as the biological con-\nstraints that make death inevitable. Despite its early emergence and gradual consolidation,\nthat conception does not prevent, and may offer a backdrop to, an alternative conception\nof death in which, ultimately, those biological constraints are denied in certain contexts. In\nshort, although it is often proposed that early emerging conceptions may stand in the way of\na more comprehensive and empirically based understanding, our findings indicate that well-\ngrounded empirical conceptions may sometimes be followed, and even overridden, by religious\nassumptions.\n738 R.
