Within this context, there is\noften the implicit belief (cf. Weingartner and Schurz, 1996, p. 203) that\ndeterministic and indeterministic descriptions are not observationally equiv-\nalent. However, the question whether these descriptions are observationally\nequivalent has hardly been discussed.\nThis paper aims to contribute to fill this gap. Namely, the central ques-\ntions of this paper are the following: are deterministic mathematical descrip-\ntions and indeterministic mathematical descriptions observationally equiva-\nlent? And what is the philosophical significance of the various results on\nobservational equivalence?\nThe deterministic and indeterministic descriptions of concern in this pa-\nper are measure-theoretic deterministic systems and stochastic processes,\nrespectively. Both are ubiquitous in science. Because of lack of space, I con-\ncentrate on descriptions where the time varies in discrete steps; but I point\nout that analogous results also hold for a continuous time parameter.\nMore specifically, when saying that a deterministic system and a stochas-\ntic process are observationally equivalent, I mean the following: the deter-\nministic system, when observed, gives the same predictions as the stochastic\nprocess. In what follows, when I say that a stochastic process can be replaced\nby a deterministic system, or conversely, I mean that it can be replaced by\nsuch a system in the sense that they are observationally equivalent.\nThis paper proceeds as follows. In section 2 I will introduce stochastic\nprocesses and measure-theoretic deterministic systems. In section 3 I will\nshow that measure-theoretic deterministic systems and stochastic processes\ncan often be replaced by each other. Given this, one might still guess that it\nis impossible to replace stochastic processes of the kinds in fact used in sci-\nence by measure-theoretic deterministic systems that are used in science. One\nmight also guess that it is impossible to replace measure-theoretic determinis-\ntic systems of the kinds used in science at every observation level by stochastic\nprocesses that are used in science. By proving results in ergodic theory, I will\nshow in section 4 that these two guesses are wrong. Therefore, even kinds of\nstochastic processes and deterministic systems which seem to give very dif-\nferent predictions are observationally equivalent. Furthermore, I will criticise\nthe claims of the previous philosophical papers Suppes (1993,1999), Suppes\nand de Barros (1996) and Winnie (1998) on observational equivalence.\n3\nFor a less technical treatment of the issues discussed in this paper, see\nWerndl (2009c).\n2 Stochastic processes and deterministic sys-\ntems\nThe indeterministic and deterministic descriptions I deal with are stochastic\nprocesses and measure-theoretic deterministic systems, respectively. There\nare two types of them: either the time parameter is discrete (discrete pro-\ncesses and systems) or there is a continuous time parameter (continuous\nprocesses and systems). I consider only discrete descriptions, but analogous\nresults hold for continuous descriptions, and these results are discussed in\nWerndl (2009d).\n2.1 Stochastic processes\nA stochastic process is a process governed by probabilistic laws. Hence\nthere is usually indeterminism in the time-evolution: if the process yields\na specific outcome, there are different outcomes that might follow; and a\nprobability distribution measures the likelihood of them. I call a sequence\nwhich describes a possible time-evolution of the stochastic process a realisa-\ntion. Nearly all, but not all, the indeterministic descriptions in science are\nstochastic processes.1\nLet me formally define stochastic processes.2 A random variable is a\nmeasurable function Z : \u2126 \u2192 M\u00af from a probability space, i.e. a measure\nspace (\u2126,\u03a3\u2126, \u03bd) with \u03bd(\u2126) = 1, to a measurable space (M\u00af,\u03a3M\u00af) where \u03a3M\u00af\ndenotes a \u03c3-algebra on M\u00af .3 The probability measure PZ(A) = P{Z \u2208 A} :=\n\u03bd(Z\u22121(A)) for all A \u2208 \u03a3M\u00af on (M\u00af,\u03a3M\u00af) is called the distribution of Z. If\n1For instance, Norton\u2019s dome (which satisfies Newton\u2019s laws) is indeterministic because\nthe time evolution fails to be bijective. Nothing in Newtonian mechanics requires us to\nassign a probability measure on the possible states of this system. It is possible to assign a\nprobability measure, but the question is whether it is natural (cf. Norton, 2003, pp. 8\u20139).\n2I assume basic knowledge about measure theory and modern probability theory. For\nmore details, see Doob (1953), Cornfeld et al. (1982) and Petersen (1983).\n3For simplicity, I assume that any measure space is complete, i.e. every subset of a\nmeasurable set of measure zero is measurable.\n4\nA consists of one element, i.e. A = {a}, I often write P{Z = a} instead of\nP{Z \u2208 A}.\nDefinition 1 A stochastic process {Zt; t \u2208 Z} is a one-parameter family of\nrandom variables Zt, t \u2208 Z, defined on the same probability space (\u2126,\u03a3\u2126, \u03bd)\nand taking values in the same measurable space (M\u00af,\u03a3M\u00af).\nThe set M\u00af is called the outcome space of the stochastic process. The bi-\ninfinite sequence r(\u03c9) := (. . . Z\u22121(\u03c9), Z0(\u03c9), Z1(\u03c9) . . .) for \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126 is called a\nrealisation (cf. Doob, 1953, pp. 4\u201346). Intuitively, t represents time; so that\neach \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126 represents a possible history in all its details, and r(\u03c9) represents\nthe description of that history by giving the score at each t.\nI will often be concerned with stationary stochastic processes. These are\nprocesses whose probabilistic laws do not change with time:\nDefinition 2 A stochastic process {Zt; t \u2208 Z} is stationary if and only if\nthe distributions of the multi-dimensional random variable (Zt1+h, . . . , Ztn+h)\nis the same as the one of (Zt1 , . . . , Ztn) for all t1, . . . , tn \u2208 Z, n \u2208 N, and all\nh \u2208 Z (Doob, 1953, p. 94).\nIt is perhaps needless to stress the importance of discrete stochastic pro-\ncesses, and stationary processes in particular: both are ubiquitous in science.\nThe following stochastic processes will accompany us throughout the pa-\nper. They are probably the most widely known.\nExample 1: Bernoulli processes.\nA Bernoulli process is a process where, intuitively, at each time point a\n(possibly biased) N -sided die is tossed where the probability for obtaining\nside sk is pk, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 N, N \u2208 N, with\n\u2211N\nk=1 pk = 1, and each toss is\nindependent of all the other ones. The mathematical definition proceeds as\nfollows. The random variables X1, . . . , Xn, n \u2208 N, are independent if and\nonly if P{X1 \u2208 A1, . . . , Xn \u2208 An} = P{X1 \u2208 A1} . . . P{Xn \u2208 An} for all\nA1, . . . , An \u2208 \u03a3M\u00af . The random variables {Zt; t \u2208 Z} are independent if and\nonly if any finite number of them is independent.\nDefinition 3 {Zt; t \u2208 Z} is a Bernoulli process if and only if (i) its outcome\nspace is a finite number of symbols M\u00af = {s1, . . . , sN}, N \u2208 N, and \u03a3M\u00af =\nP(M\u00af), where P(M\u00af) is the power set of M\u00af ; (ii) P{Zt = sk} = pk for all t \u2208 Z\nand all k, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 N ; and (iii) {Zt; t \u2208 Z} are independent.\n5\nClearly, a Bernoulli process is stationary.\nIn this definition the probability space \u2126 is not explicitly given. I now give\na representation of Bernoulli processes where \u2126 is explicitly given. The idea\nis that \u2126 is the set of realisations of the process. For a Bernoulli process with\noutcomes M\u00af = {s1, . . . , sN} which have probabilities p1, . . . , pN , N \u2208 N, let\n\u2126 be the set of all sequences \u03c9 = (. . . \u03c9\u22121\u03c90\u03c91 . . .) with \u03c9i \u2208 M\u00af corresponding\nto one of the possible outcomes of the i-th trial in a doubly infinite sequence\nof trials. Let \u03a3\u2126 be the \u03c3-algebra generated by the cylinder-sets\nCA1...Ani1...in ={\u03c9 \u2208 \u2126 |\u03c9i1\u2208A1,. . ., \u03c9in\u2208An, Aj\u2208\u03a3M\u00af , ij\u2208Z, i1<. . .<in, 1\u2264 j\u2264n}.\n(1)\nSince the outcomes are independent, these sets have probability \u03bd\u00af(CA1...Ani1...in ) :=\nP{Zi1 \u2208 A1} . . . P{Zin \u2208 An}. Let \u03bd be defined as the unique extension of \u03bd\u00af\nto a measure on \u03a3\u2126. Finally, define Zt(\u03c9) := \u03c9t (the t-th coordinate of \u03c9).\nThen {Zt; t \u2208 Z} is the Bernoulli process we started with.\n2.2 Deterministic systems\nAccording to the canonical definition, a description is deterministic exactly\nif any two solutions that agree at one time agree at all times (Butterfield,\n2005). I call a sequence which describes the evolution of a deterministic\ndescription over time a solution.\nThis paper is concerned with measure-theoretic deterministic descrip-\ntions, in short deterministic systems:\nDefinition 4 A deterministic system is a quadruple (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ) consist-\ning of a probability space (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5) and a bijective measurable function\nT :M\u2192M such that also T\u22121 is measurable.\nThe solution through m, m \u2208 M , is the sequence (T t(m))t\u2208Z. M is the\nset of all possible states called the phase space; and T , which describes how\nsolutions evolve, is called the evolution function. Clearly, Definition 4 defines\nsystems which are deterministic according to the above canonical definition.\nWhen observing a deterministic system, one observes a value functionally\ndependent on, but maybe different from, the actual state. Hence observations\ncan be modeled by an observation function, i.e. a measurable function \u03a6 :\nM \u2192 MO from (M,\u03a3M) to the measurable space (MO,\u03a3MO) (cf. Ornstein\nand Weiss, 1991, p. 16).\nI will often be concerned with measure-preserving deterministic systems\n(cf. Cornfeld et al., 1982, pp. 3\u20135).\n6\nDefinition 5 A measure-preserving deterministic system is a deterministic\nsystem (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ) where the measure \u00b5 is invariant, i.e. for all A \u2208 \u03a3M\n\u00b5(T (A)) = \u00b5(A). (2)\nMeasure-preserving deterministic systems are important models in physics\nbut are also important in other sciences such as biology, geology etc. This\nis so because condition (2) is not very restrictive. For first, all deterministic\nHamiltonian systems and statistical-mechanical systems, and their discrete\nversions, are measure-preserving; and the relevant invariant measure is the\nLebesgue-measure or a close cousin of it (Petersen, 1983, pp. 5\u20136). Second, an\ninvariant measure need not be the Lebesgue measure, i.e. measure-preserving\ndeterministic systems need not be volume-preserving. Indeed, systems which\nare not volume-preserving (called \u2018dissipative systems\u2019) can often be modeled\nas measure-preserving systems. For instance, the long-term behaviour of a\nlarge class of deterministic systems can be modeled by measure-preserving\nsystems (Eckmann and Ruelle, 1985). More generally, the potential scope\nof measure-preserving deterministic systems is quite wide: although some\nevolution functions do not have invariant measures, for very wide classes of\nevolution functions invariant measures are proven to exist. For instance, if\nT is a continuous function on a compact metric space, there exists at least\none invariant measure (Man\u02dce\u00b4, 1987, p. 52).\nI adopt the common assumption that invariant measures can be inter-\npreted as probability measures. This deep issue has been discussed in sta-\ntistical mechanics but is not the focus of this paper. I only mention two\ninterpretations that naturally suggest interpreting measures as probability.\nAccording to the time-average interpretation, the measure of a set A is the\nlong-run average of the time that a solution spends in A. According to the\nensemble interpretation, the measure of a set A at t corresponds to the frac-\ntion of solutions starting from some set of initial conditions that are in A at\ntime t [cf. Eckmann and Ruelle, 1985, pp. 625-627; Lavis, forthcoming].\nThe following deterministic system will accompany us.\nExample 2: The baker\u2019s system.\nOn the unit square M = [0, 1] \u00d7 [0, 1] \\ \u0393, where \u0393 = {(x, y) |x = j\/2n or\ny = j\/2n, n \u2208 N, 0 \u2264 j \u2264 2n} consider\nT (x, y) = (2x,\ny\n2\n) if 0 \u2264 x < 1\n2\n; (2x\u2212 1, y + 1\n2\n) if\n1\n2\n\u2264 x \u2264 1. (3)\n7\nFigure 1: The baker\u2019s system on 0 \u2264 y \u2264 1\/2\n(\u0393 is excluded to be able to define a bijective function T ). Figure 1 illus-\ntrates that the baker\u2019s system first stretches the unit square to twice its\nlength and half its width; then it cuts the rectangle obtained in half and\nplaces the right half on top of the left. For the Lebesgue measure \u00b5 and\nthe Lebesgue \u03c3-algebra \u03a3M one obtains the measure-preserving determin-\nistic system (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ). This system also has physical meaning: e.g. it\ndescribes the movement of a particle with initial position (x, y) in the unit\nsquare. The particle moves with constant speed perpendicular to the unit\nsquare. It bounces on several mirrors, causing it to return to the unit square\nat T (x, y) (Pitowsky, 1995, p. 166).\n3 Basic observational equivalence\nLet me turn to some results about observational equivalence which are basic\nin the sense that they are about the question whether, given a deterministic\nsystem, it is possible to find any stochastic process which is observationally\nequivalent to the deterministic system, and conversely.\nHow can a stochastic process and a deterministic system yield the same\npredictions? When a deterministic system is observed, one only sees how\none observed value follows the next observed value. Because the observation\nfunction can map two or more actual states to the same observed value, the\nsame present observed value can lead to different future observed values. And\nso a stochastic process can be observationally equivalent to a deterministic\nsystem only if it is assumed that the deterministic system is observed with\nan observation function which is many to one. Yet this assumption is usually\nunproblematic: the main reason being that perhaps deterministic systems\nused in science typically have an infinitely large phase space, and scientists\n8\ncan only observe finitely many different values.\nA probability measure is defined on a deterministic system. Hence the\npredictions derived from a deterministic system are the probability distribu-\ntions over sequences of possible observations. And similarly, the predictions\nobtained from a stochastic process are the probability distributions over se-\nquences of possible outcomes. Consequently, the most natural meaning of\nthe phrase \u2018a stochastic process and a deterministic system are observation-\nally equivalent\u2019 is: (i) the set of possible outcomes of the stochastic process\nis identical to the the set of possible observed values of the deterministic sys-\ntem, and (ii) the realisations of the stochastic process and the solutions of\nthe deterministic system coarse-grained by the observation function have the\nsame probability distribution.\nLet me now investigate when deterministic systems can be replaced by\nstochastic processes. Then I will investigate when stochastic processes can\nbe replaced by deterministic systems.\n3.1 Deterministic systems replaced by stochastic pro-\ncesses\nLet (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ) be a deterministic system. According to the canonical\nDefinition 1, Zt(x) := T\nt(x) is a stochastic process with exactly the same\npredictions as the deterministic system. However, this process is evidently\nequivalent to the original deterministic system, and the probabilities that\none value leads to another one are trivial (0 or 1). Hence it is still \u201creally\u201d a\ndeterministic system.\nBut one can do better by appealing to observation functions as explained\nabove; and, to my knowledge, these results are unknown in philosophy. As-\nsume the deterministic system (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ) is observed with \u03a6 :M \u2192MO.\nAccording to Definition 1, {Zt := \u03a6(T t); t \u2208 Z} is a stochastic process. It\nis constructed by applying \u03a6 to the deterministic system. Hence the out-\ncomes of the stochastic process are the observed values of the deterministic\nsystem; and the realisations of the process and the solutions of the determin-\nistic system coarse-grained by the observation function have the same prob-\nability distribution. Consequently, according to the characterisation above,\n(M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ) observed with \u03a6 is observationally equivalent to stochastic pro-\ncess {\u03a6(T t); t \u2208 Z}. But the important question is whether {\u03a6(T t); t \u2208 Z}\nis nontrivial. Indeed, the stochastic process {\u03a6(T t); t \u2208 Z} is often nontriv-\n9\nial. I show now one result in this direction; besides, several other results\nalso indicate this (cf. Cornfeld et al., 1982, pp. 178-179).4 \u2014 Before I can\nproceed, the following definitions are needed:\nDefinition 6 A measure-preserving deterministic system (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ) is\nergodic if and only if for all A,B \u2208 \u03a3M\nlim\nn\u2192\u221e\n1\nn\nn\u22121\u2211\ni=0\n(\u00b5(T n(A) \u2229B)\u2212 \u00b5(A)\u00b5(B)) = 0. (4)\nA partition of a measure space (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5) is a set \u03b1 = {\u03b11, . . . , \u03b1n} with\n\u03b1i \u2208 \u03a3M , n \u2208 N, such that\n\u22c3n\ni=1 \u03b1i = M, \u00b5(\u03b1i) > 0, and \u03b1i \u2229 \u03b1j = \u2205 for\ni 6= j, 0 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n. A partition is nontrivial if and only if it has more than\none element. Let me make the realistic assumption that the observations have\nfinite accuracy, i.e. that only finitely many values are observed. Then one has\na finite-valued observation function \u03a6; i.e. \u03a6(m) =\n\u2211n\ni=1 oi\u03c7\u03b1i(m), MO :=\n{oi | 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n} for some partition \u03b1 of (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5) and some n \u2208 N, where \u03c7A\ndenotes the characteristic function of A. A finite-valued observation function\nis called nontrivial if and only if its corresponding partition is nontrivial (cf.\nCornfeld et al., 1982, p. 179).\nThe following proposition shows that for ergodic deterministic systems for\nwhich there is no nontrivial set which is eventually mapped onto itself, and\nevery finite-valued observation function, the stochastic process {\u03a6(T t); t \u2208\nZ} is nontrivial. That is, there is an observed value oi \u2208MO such that for all\nobserved values oj \u2208 MO the probability of moving from oi to oj is smaller\nthan 1. Hence there are two or more observed values that can follow oi; and\nthe probability that oi moves to any of these observed values is between 0 and\n1. This is a strong result because irrespective of how detailed one looks at\nthe deterministic system, one always obtains a nontrivial stochastic process.\nProposition 1 Assume that the deterministic system (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ) is er-\ngodic and that there does not exist an n \u2208 N and a C \u2208 \u03a3M , 0 < \u00b5(C) < 1,\nsuch that, except for a set of measure zero, T n(C) = C. Then for every\nnontrivial finite-valued observation function \u03a6 :M \u2192MO and the stochastic\n4For instance, if K-systems are observed with a finite-valued observation function, one\nobtains nontrivial stochastic processes because for K-systems the entropy of any finite\npartition is positive (cf. Petersen, 1983, p. 63).\n10\nprocess {Zt := \u03a6(T t); t \u2208 Z} the following holds: there is an oi \u2208 MO such\nthat for all oj \u2208MO, P{Zt+1=oj |Zt=oi} < 1.5\nFor a proof, see subsection 6.1. For instance, the baker\u2019s system (Example 2)\nis weakly mixing, and thus any finite-valued observation function gives rise\nto a nontrivial stochastic process.\nMeasure-preserving systems are typically what is called \u2018weakly mixing\u20196\n(Halmos, 1944). It is easy to see that any weakly mixing system satisfies\nthe assumption of Proposition 1 (weakly mixing is stronger than this as-\nsumption).7 Hence Proposition 1 shows that for typical measure-preserving\ndeterministic systems any finite-valued observation function yields a nontriv-\nial stochastic process.\nYet Proposition 1 does not say much about whether the measure-preserving\ndeterministic systems encountered in science fulfill the assumption of Propo-\nsition 1 because those systems constitute a small class of all measure-preserving\nsystems. Indeed, the KAM theorem says that the phase space of integrable\nHamiltonian systems which are perturbed by a small nonintegrable pertur-\nbation breaks up into stable and unstable regions. With increasing pertur-\nbation the unstable regions become larger and often eventually cover nearly\nthe entire hypersurface of constant energy. Because a solution is confined\nto a region, the KAM theorem implies that the discrete versions of infinitely\ndifferentiable Hamiltonian systems are typically not ergodic (Berkovitz et al.,\n2006, section 4). (I call the discrete-time systems obtained by looking at a\ncontinuous-time system S at points of time nt0, n \u2208 N, t0 \u2208 R arbitrary,\nt0 6= 0, the discrete versions of S).8\n5For a random variable Z to a measurable space (M\u00af,\u03a3M\u00af ) where M\u00af is finite the condi-\ntional probability is defined as usual as:\nP{Z \u2208 A |Z \u2208 B} := P{Z \u2208 A \u2229B}\/P{Z \u2208 B} for all A,B \u2286 \u03a3M\u00af with P{Z \u2208 B} > 0.\n6(M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ) is weakly mixing if and only if for all A,B \u2208 \u03a3M\nlim\nn\u2192\u221e\n1\nn\nn\u22121\u2211\ni=0\n|\u00b5(Tn(A) \u2229B)\u2212 \u00b5(A)\u00b5(B)| = 0. (5)\n7First, it is clear that weakly mixing systems are ergodic. Second, assume that for a\nweakly mixing system there exists an n \u2208 N and a C \u2208 \u03a3M , 0 < \u00b5(C) < 1, such that,\nexcept for a set of measure zero, Tn(C) = C. But then equation (5) cannot hold for\nA := C and B := C. In subsection 4.2.2 I will show that the irrational rotation on the\ncircle satisfies the assumption of Proposition 1 but is not weakly mixing.\n8Alternatively, continuous-time deterministic systems can be discretised by considering\n11\nDespite this, Proposition 1 applies to several systems encountered in\nscience. First, a motion is chaotic just in case it is deterministic yet also\nunstable because nearby initial conditions eventually lead to very different\noutcomes. I will not need a more exact definition; but I will call a system\nchaotic if the motion is chaotic on the entire phase space and locally chaotic\nif the motion is chaotic on a region of phase space. Chaotic systems are\nusually regarded as weakly mixing (Berkovitz et al., 2006, p. 688; Werndl,\n2009a, section 3). And as will be argued in subsection 4.1, there are several\nphysically relevant chaotic and weakly mixing systems. Moreover, in sub-\nsection 4.2.2 it will be shown that there are even systems which are neither\nchaotic nor locally chaotic but which satisfy Proposition 1. Second, even\nif the whole system does not satisfy the assumption of Proposition 1, the\nmotion of the system restricted to some regions of phase space might well\nsatisfy this assumption. In fact, Proposition 1 immediately implies the fol-\nlowing result. Assume that for a measure-preserving system (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T )\nthere is a A \u2208 \u03a3M , \u00b5(A) > 0, such that the system restricted to A9 fulfills\nthe assumption of Proposition 1. Then all observations which discriminate\nbetween values in A lead to nontrivial stochastic processes. That is, for any\nobservation function \u03a6(m) =\n\u2211n\ni=1 oi\u03c7\u03b1i(m) where there are k, l, k 6= l, such\nthat \u00b5(A \u2229 \u03b1k) 6= 0 and \u00b5(A \u2229 \u03b1l) 6= 0, there is an outcome oi \u2208 MO such\nthat for all outcomes oj \u2208 MO it holds that P{Zt+1 = oj |Zt = oi} < 1. In\nparticular, although mathematically little is known, it is conjectured that the\nmotion restricted to unstable regions of KAM-type systems is weakly mixing\n(Berkovitz et al., 2006, section 4; Werndl, 2009a, section 3). If this is true,\nthen my argument shows that for many observation functions of KAM-type\nsystems one obtains nontrivial stochastic processes.\n3.2 Stochastic processes replaced by deterministic sys-\ntems\nI have shown that deterministic systems, when observed, can yield nontriv-\nial stochastic processes. But can one find, for every stochastic process, a\nthe successive hits of a trajectory on a suitable Poincare\u00b4 section. All I say about discrete\nversions of continuous systems also holds true for discrete-time systems arising in this way,\nexcept that the latter are more often ergodic (Berkovitz et al., 2006, pp. 680\u2013685).\n9That is, the system (A,\u03a3M\u2229A, \u00b5A, TA), where \u03a3M\u2229A := {B \u2229A|B \u2208 \u03a3M}, \u00b5A(X) :=\n\u00b5(X)\n\u00b5(A) , and TA denotes T restricted to A.\n12\ndeterministic system which produces this process?\nThe following idea of how to replace stochastic processes by deterministic\nsystems is well known in the technical literature (Petersen, 1983, pp. 6\u20137)10\nand known to philosophers (Butterfield, 2005); I also need to discuss it for\nwhat follows later. The underlying thought is that for each realisation r(\u03c9),\none sets up a deterministic system with phase space {r(\u03c9)}.\nSo consider a stochastic process {Zt; t \u2208 Z} from (\u2126,\u03a3\u2126, \u03bd) to (M\u00af,\u03a3M\u00af).\nLet M be the set of all bi-infinite sequences m = (. . .m\u22121m0m1 . . .) with\nmi \u2208 M\u00af, i \u2208 Z, and let mt be the t-th coordinate of m, t \u2208 Z. Let \u03a3M\nbe the \u03c3-algebra generated by the cylinder-sets as defined in (1) at the end\nof subsection 2.1. {Zt; t \u2208 Z} assigns to each cylinder set CA1...Ani1...in a pre-\nmeasure, namely the probability P{Zi1 \u2208 A1, . . . , Zin \u2208 An}. Let \u00b5 be the\nunique extension of this pre-measure to a measure on \u03a3M . Let T : M \u2192 M\nbe the left shift, i.e. T ((. . .m\u22121m0m1 . . .)) := (. . .m0m1m2 . . .). T is bijective\nand measurable, and so one obtains the deterministic system (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ).\nFinally, assume one sees only the 0-th coordinate of the sequence m, i.e. one\napplies the observation function \u03a60 :M \u2192 M\u00af,\u03a60(m) = m0. I now define:\nDefinition 7 (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T,\u03a60) as constructed above is the deterministic\nrepresentation of the process {Zt; t \u2208 Z}.\nFor the deterministic representation (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T,\u03a60) of {Zt; t \u2208 Z} it\nis assumed that the 0-th coordinate is observed. Consequently, the possible\noutcomes of {Zt; t \u2208 Z} are the possible observed values of (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T,\u03a60).\nClearly, any realisation r(\u03c9) of the process is contained in M , and observ-\ning the solution (T t(r(\u03c9)))t\u2208Z with \u03a60 exactly gives r(\u03c9). Furthermore, the\nmeasure \u00b5 is defined by the probabilities which are assigned by {Zt; t \u2208 Z}\nto each cylinder set. Hence the probability distribution over the realisations\nof {Zt; t \u2208 Z} is the same as the one over the sequences of observed values of\n(M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T,\u03a60). Thus, according to the characterisation at the start of this\nsection, a stochastic process is observationally equivalent to its deterministic\nrepresentation. Hence every stochastic process can be replaced by at least one\ndeterministic system. (When there is no risk of confusion, I also refer to the\nsystem (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ) of the deterministic representation (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T,\u03a60)\nas the deterministic representation.)\nFor Bernoulli processes (Example 1) the deterministic representation is\nthe following. (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5) is the measure space (\u2126,\u03a3\u2126, \u03bd) as defined at the\n10Petersen discusses it only for stationary stochastic processes; I consider generally\nstochastic processes.\n13\nend of subsection 2.1. T ((. . . \u03c9\u22121\u03c90\u03c91 . . .)) := (. . . \u03c90\u03c91\u03c92 . . .) for \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126 and\n\u03a60(\u03c9) = \u03c90.\nDefinition 8 The deterministic representation (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ) of the Bernoulli\nprocess with probabilities p1, . . . , pN , N \u2208 N, is called the Bernoulli shift with\nprobabilities (p1, . . . , pN).\nFrom a philosophical perspective the deterministic representation is a\ncheat because its states are constructed to encode the future and past out-\ncomes of the stochastic process. Despite this, it is important to know that the\ndeterministic representation exists. Of course, there is the question whether\ndeterministic systems which do not involve a cheat can replace a stochastic\nprocess. I will turn to this question in section 4, where I show that for some\nstochastic processes this is indeed the case. To my knowledge, it is unknown\nwhether every stochastic process can be thus replaced.\n3.3 A mathematical definition of observational equiv-\nalence\nLet me now mathematically define what it means for a stochastic process and\na deterministic system to be observationally equivalent. The notion of iso-\nmorphism captures the idea that deterministic systems are probabilistically\nequivalent, i.e. that their states can be put into one-to-one correspondence\nsuch that the corresponding solutions have the same probability distribu-\ntions.\nDefinition 9 (M1,\u03a3M1 , \u00b51, T1) is isomorphic to (M2,\u03a3M2 , \u00b52, T2) (where both\nsystems are assumed to be measure-preserving) if and only if there are mea-\nsurable sets M\u02c6i \u2286 Mi with \u00b5i(Mi \\ M\u02c6i) = 0 and TiM\u02c6i \u2286 M\u02c6i (i = 1, 2),\nand there is a bijection \u03c6 : M\u02c61 \u2192 M\u02c62 such that (i) \u03c6(A) \u2208 \u03a3M2 for all\nA \u2208 \u03a3M1 , A \u2286 M\u02c61, and \u03c6\u22121(B) \u2208 \u03a3M1 for all B \u2208 \u03a3M2 , B \u2286 M\u02c62; (ii)\n\u00b52(\u03c6(A)) = \u00b51(A) for all A \u2208 \u03a3M1 , A \u2286 M\u02c61; (iii) \u03c6(T1(m)) = T2(\u03c6(m)) for\nall m \u2208 M\u02c61 (cf. Petersen, 1983, p. 4).\nOne easily sees that \u2018being isomorphic\u2019 is an equivalence relation. Isomor-\nphic systems may have different phase spaces. If identical sets M\u02c61 and M\u02c62\ncan be found, then the deterministic systems are obviously probabilistically\nequivalent and have, from a probabilistic viewpoint, the same phase space;\n14\nfor this case it will later be convenient to say that the measure-preserving\ndeterministic systems are manifestly isomorphic.\nAccording to the characterisation at the beginning of this section, a deter-\nministic system (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ), observed with \u03a6, gives the same predictions as\n{Zt| t \u2208 Z} exactly if (i) the outcomes of {Zt| t \u2208 Z} are the observed values of\n(M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ), and (ii) the deterministic representation of {\u03a6(T t); t \u2208 Z} is\nprobabilistically equivalent to the deterministic representation of {Zt| t \u2208 Z}.\nHence one arrives at the following definition of \u2018observational equivalence\u2019;\n(for what follows, a definition for measure-preserving systems and, corre-\nspondingly, stationary stochastic processes will suffice):11\nDefinition 10 The stationary stochastic process {Zt; t \u2208 Z} and the measure-\npreserving deterministic system (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ), observed with \u03a6, are observationally\nequivalent if and only if the deterministic representation of {\u03a6(T t); t \u2208 Z}\nis manifestly isomorphic to the deterministic representation of {Zt; t \u2208 Z}.\nAll the cases of observational equivalence already discussed are cases of\nobservational equivalence in the sense of Definition 10. First, I claimed in\nsubsection 3.1 that (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ) observed with \u03a6 is observationally equiv-\nalent to the stochastic process {\u03a6(T t); t \u2208 Z}. This is true because every\nsystem is manifestly isomorphic to itself. Second, I claimed in subsection 3.2\nthat the deterministic representation (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T,\u03a60) of {Zt; t \u2208 Z} is ob-\nservationally equivalent to {Zt; t \u2208 Z}. This is true because the deterministic\nrepresentation of {\u03a60(T t); t \u2208 Z} is (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T,\u03a60).\nOne final point: assume that (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ) is isomorphic via \u03c6 : M\u02c6 \u2192 M\u02c62\nto the deterministic representation (M2,\u03a3M2 , \u00b52, T2,\u03a60) of {Zt; t \u2208 Z}. This\nmeans that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the solutions of\nthe deterministic system and the realisations of the stochastic process. Thus\n(M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ) restricted to M\u02c6 and observed with \u03a60(\u03c6(m)) is observationally\nequivalent to {Zt; t \u2208 Z}. This is so because the deterministic representa-\ntion of {\u03a60(\u03c6(T t)); t \u2208 Z} where T is restricted to M\u02c6 is identical to the\n11For a measure-preserving system (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ) the process {\u03a6(T t); t \u2208 Z} is station-\nary: {x \u2208 M |\u03a6(T t1(x)) \u2208 A1, . . . ,\u03a6(T tn(x)) \u2208 An, Ai \u2208 \u03a3MO , ti \u2208 Z, n \u2208 N} is iden-\ntical to A := T\u2212t1(\u03a6\u22121(A1) \u2229 . . . \u2229 T t1\u2212tn\u03a6\u22121(An)). Likewise, {x \u2208 M |\u03a6(T t1+h(x)) \u2208\nA1, . . . ,\u03a6(T tn+h(x)) \u2208 An} is B := T\u2212(t1+h)(\u03a6\u22121(A1) \u2229 . . . \u2229 T t1\u2212tn\u03a6\u22121(An)). Because\nthe system is measure-preserving, \u00b5(A) = \u00b5(B), implying that {\u03a6(T t); t \u2208 Z} is station-\nary. And if {Zt| t \u2208 Z} is stationary, its deterministic representation (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ) is\nmeasure-preserving. For stationarity implies that \u00b5(T (A)) = \u00b5(A) for any cylinder set A,\nand hence that \u00b5(T (A)) = \u00b5(A) for all A \u2208 \u03a3M (cf. Cornfeld et al., 1982, p. 178).\n15\ndeterministic representation of {\u03a60(T t2); t \u2208 Z} where T2 is restricted to M\u02c62.\nHence the deterministic representation of {\u03a60(\u03c6(T t)); t \u2208 Z} is manifestly\nisomorphic to (M2,\u03a3M2 , \u00b52, T2).\nThe following definition will be important later:\nDefinition 11 (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ) is a Bernoulli system if and only if it is iso-\nmorphic to a Bernoulli shift.\nThe meaning of Bernoulli systems is clear, viz. the solutions of a Bernoulli\nsystem can put into one-to-one correspondence with the realisations of a\nBernoulli process. Thus a Bernoulli system, observed with \u03a60(\u03c6), produces\na Bernoulli process. Finally, I note the important result that two Bernoulli\nshifts (and hence two Bernoulli systems) are isomorphic if and only if they\nhave the same Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy, where the Kolmogorov-Sinai en-\ntropy of a Bernoulli shift with probabilities (p1, . . . , pn) is\n\u2211n\ni=1\u2212pi log2 pi\n(Frigg and Werndl, 2010; Ornstein, 1974, pp. 5\u20133; Werndl, 2009b).\n4 Advanced observational equivalence\nIn this section I discuss results which are \u2018advanced\u2019 in the sense that they are\nabout the question whether it is possible to replace deterministic systems in\nscience with stochastic processes in science. The phrase \u2018systems in science\u2019\n(or \u2018processes in science\u2019) is a short-hand for systems (or processes) which\nare used in science to model phenomena.\n4.1 Deterministic system in science which replace stochas-\ntic processes in science\nThe deterministic representation does not naturally arise in science (no doubt\nreflecting that fact that is a philosophical cheat). And the results so far only\nshow that stochastic processes in science, e.g. a Bernoulli process, can be\nreplaced by its deterministic representation. Hence it seems hard to imagine\nhow deterministic systems in science could replace stochastic processes in\nscience. In particular, it seems hard to imagine how deterministic systems\nin science could be random enough to replace random stochastic processes\nsuch as Bernoulli processes. Thus one might conjecture that it is impossible\nto replace stochastic processes in science by deterministic systems in science.\n16\nBernoulli processes (Example 1) are often regarded as the most random\ndiscrete-time stochastic processes because their outcomes are independent\n(cf. Ornstein, 1989). Are there deterministic systems in science which, when\nobserved, are observationally equivalent to Bernoulli processes? And are\nthere even deterministic systems in science which are Bernoulli systems?\nHistorically, it was long thought that the answer to these questions is nega-\ntive (cf. Sinai, 1989, p. 834). So it was a big surprise when it was discovered\nfrom the 1960s onwards that there are several deterministic systems in sci-\nence which are Bernoulli systems (among them systems producing Bernoulli\nprocesses with equiprobable outcomes). Let me mention some of the most\nimportant examples, which are also some of the most important examples of\nchaotic systems.12\nTo start with, there are systems in Newtonian mechanics, some of which\nare simple models of statistical mechanical systems, whose discrete versions\nare proven to be Bernoulli systems. The most prominent examples are: first,\nsome hard sphere systems, which describe the motion of a number of hard\nspheres undergoing elastic reflections at the boundary and collisions amongst\neach other; e.g., the motion of N hard balls on the m torus for N \u2265 2 and\nm \u2265 N ; second, billiard systems with convex obstacles; and third, geodesic\nflows of negative curvature, i.e. frictionless motion of a particle moving with\nunit speed on a compact manifold with everywhere negative curvature. It is\nusually very hard to prove that systems are Bernoulli. Therefore, for many\nsystems it is only conjectured that their discrete versions are Bernoulli, e.g.,\nfor all hard sphere systems and the motion of KAM-type systems restricted\nto some regions of phase space (Ornstein and Weiss, 1991, section 4; Young,\n1997; Berkovitz et al., 2006, p. 679\u2013680).\nFurthermore, there are dissipative systems which are Bernoulli systems:\nsuch as the logistic map and generalised versions thereof, the He\u00b4non map and\ngeneralised versions thereof, and the discrete versions of the Lorenz system\nand generalised versions thereof. Some of these systems give relatively ac-\ncurate predictions, e.g. the Lorenz system as a model for water-wheels. Yet\noften these systems are motivated as simple models which help us to un-\nderstand, and not so much to predict, phenomena: e.g. the logistic map for\npopulation and climate dynamics, and the He\u00b4non map and the Lorenz system\nfor weather dynamics (Lorenz, 1964; May, 1976; Jacobson, 1981; Benedicks\nand Young, 1993; Smith, 1998, chapter 8; Lyubich, 2002; Luzzatto, 2005).\n12Bernoulli systems are regarded as strongly chaotic.\n17\nAlso the baker\u2019s system (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ) (Example 2), a somewhat artificial\nexample of deterministic motion, is Bernoulli. Assign to each (x, y) inM the\nsequence \u03c6(x, y) = . . . \u03c9\u22122\u03c9\u22121\u03c90\u03c91\u03c92 . . . defined by the binary expansion of\nthe coordinates:\nx = 0.\u03c90\u03c91 . . . =\n\u221e\u2211\ni=1\n\u03c9i\u22121\n2i\n; y = 0.\u03c9\u22121\u03c9\u22122 . . . =\n\u221e\u2211\ni=1\n\u03c9\u2212i\n2i\n. (6)\nConsider the Bernoulli shift (M2,\u03a3M2 , \u00b52, T2) with states s1, s2 and proba-\nbilities (1\n2\n, 1\n2\n). Let M\u02c62 be the subset of M2 excluding all states beginning or\nending with an infinite sequence of ones or zeros; note that \u00b52(M\u02c62) = 1. One\neasily verifies that \u03c6 : M \u2192 M\u02c62 gives an isomorphism from (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T )\nto (M2,\u03a3M2 , \u00b52, T2). Hence the baker\u2019s system with the observation function\n\u03a6((x, y)) := s1\u03c7\u03b11((x, y)) + s2\u03c7\u03b12((x, y)), where \u03b1 = {\u03b11, \u03b12} := {[0, 12) \u00d7\n[0, 1] \\ \u0393, [1\n2\n, 1]\u00d7 [0, 1] \\ \u0393} yields the Bernoulli process with states s1, s2 and\nprobabilities (1\n2\n, 1\n2\n).\nA Bernoulli system is weakly mixing (Petersen, 1983, p. 58). Hence,\nprovided it is observed with a finite-valued observation function, one always\nobtains a nontrivial stochastic process (Proposition 1).\nWhat is the significance of the these results? They show that the conjec-\nture advanced at the beginning of this subsection is wrong: it is possible to\nreplace stochastic processes in science by deterministic systems in science.13\nOf course, the question arises whether for deterministic systems in sci-\nence which are observationally equivalent to stochastic processes in science\nthe corresponding observation function is natural in the sense that one might\nencounter it when modeling phenomena. The answer depends on the deter-\nministic system and the phenomenon under consideration. For some systems\nthe observation function is very involved and thus no natural interpretation\ncan be found. But in other cases the observation function corresponds to a\nrealistic way of observing the system.\nFor instance, recall that the baker\u2019s system models a particle bouncing on\nseveral mirrors where (x, y) denotes the position of the particle on a square.\nHere an observer might well only be interested in whether the position of\nthe particle is to the left or to the right of the square. Then the observa-\ntion function \u03a6((x, y)) := s1\u03c7\u03b11((x, y)) + s2\u03c7\u03b12((x, y)), above, which indeed\n13The arguments in this section allow any meaning of \u2018deterministic systems in science\u2019\nthat is wide enough to include some Bernoulli systems but narrow enough to exclude\nsystems such as the deterministic representation.\n18\nproduces a Bernoulli process, would be natural.\n4.2 Stochastic processes which replace deterministic\nsystems in science at every observation level\n4.2.1 \u03b5-congruence and replacement by Markov processes\nThe previous discussion showed that for several deterministic systems in sci-\nence, regardless which finite-valued observation function one applies, one\nalways obtains a stochastic process. But to obtain systems in science such\nas Bernoulli processes, it seems crucial that coarse observation functions are\napplied. Hence it is hard to imagine that by taking finer and finer observa-\ntions of deterministic systems in science one still obtains stochastic processes\nin science. In particular, it is hard to imagine that one still obtains random\nstochastic processes. Therefore, one might conjecture that it is impossible to\nreplace deterministic systems in science at every observation level by stochas-\ntic processes in science.\nLet me introduce one of the most natural ways of understanding the\nphrase \u2018at any observation level\u2019, i.e. the notion that stochastic processes of\na certain type replace a deterministic system at any observation level. I first\nexplain what it means for a deterministic system and a stochastic process\nto give the same predictions at an observation level \u03b5 > 0, \u03b5 \u2208 R. There\nare two aspects. First, one imagines that in practice, for sufficiently small\n\u03b51, one cannot distinguish states of the deterministic system which are less\nthan the distance \u03b51 apart. The second aspect concerns probabilities: in\npractice, for sufficiently small \u03b52, one will not be able to observe differences\nin probabilities of less than \u03b52. Assume that \u03b5 is smaller than \u03b51 and \u03b52. Then\na deterministic system and a stochastic process give the same predictions at\nobservation level \u03b5 if the following holds: the solutions of the deterministic\nsystem can be put into one-to-one correspondence with the realisations of the\nstochastic process in such a way that the actual state of the deterministic\nsystem and the corresponding outcome of the stochastic process are at each\ntime point less then \u03b5 apart except for a set whose probability is smaller than\n\u03b5.\nMathematically, this idea is captured by the notion of \u03b5-congruence. To\ndefine it, one needs to speak of distances between states in the phase space\nM of the deterministic system; hence one assumes a metric dM defined on\nM . So we need to find a stochastic process whose outcome is within distance\n19\n\u03b5 of the actual state of the deterministic system. Hence one assumes that the\npossible outcomes of the stochastic process are a subset of the phase space of\nthe deterministic system. For what follows, it suffices to consider measure-\npreserving deterministic systems and, correspondingly, stationary processes.\nNow recall Definition 7 of the deterministic representation and Definition 9\nof being isomorphic. So finally, I can define:\nDefinition 12 Let (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ) be a measure-preserving deterministic sys-\ntem, where (M,dM) is a metric space. Let (M2,\u03a3M2 , \u00b52, T2,\u03a60) be the de-\nterministic representation of the stationary stochastic process {Zt; t \u2208 Z},\nwhich takes values in (M,dM), i.e. \u03a60 : M2 \u2192 M . (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ) is \u03b5-\ncongruent to (M2,\u03a3M2 , \u00b52, T2,\u03a60) if and only if (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ) is isomorphic\nvia a function \u03c6 : M \u2192 M2 to (M2,\u03a3M2 , \u00b52, T2) and dM(m,\u03a60(\u03c6(m))) < \u03b5\nfor all m \u2208M except for a set of measure < \u03b5 in M (cf. Ornstein and Weiss,\n1991, pp. 22\u201323).\nNote that \u03b5-congruence does not assume that the deterministic system is ob-\nserved with an observation function. Of course, observation functions can be\nintroduced. Assume one observes a deterministic system with an observation\nfunction. Then there is a stochastic process which is \u03b5-congruent to the de-\nterministic system such that the probabilistic predictions resulting from the\nobservation function differ at most by \u03b5 from the probabilistic predictions\nobtained by applying the observation function to the \u03b5-congruent stochastic\nprocess.\nBy generalising over \u03b5, one obtains a natural meaning of the notion that\nstochastic processes of a certain type replace a measure-preserving determin-\nistic system at any observation level, namely: for every \u03b5 > 0 there is a\nstochastic process of this type which gives the same predictions at observa-\ntion level \u03b5. Or technically: for every \u03b5 > 0 there exists a stochastic process\nof this type which is \u03b5-congruent to the deterministic system.\nFor Bernoulli processes the next outcome of the process is independent\nof its previous outcomes. So, intuitively, it seems clear that deterministic\nsystems in science, for which the next state of the system is constrained by\nits previous states (because of the underlying determinism at the level of\nstates), cannot be replaced by Bernoulli processes at every observation level.\nSmith (1998, pp. 160\u2013162) also hints at this idea but does not substantiate\nit with a proof. The following theorem shows that, for our notion of replace-\nment at every observation level, this idea is indeed correct under very mild\n20\nassumptions, which hold for deterministic systems in science.14 Hence this\ntheorem shows a limitation on the observational equivalence of deterministic\nsystems and stochastic processes.\nTheorem 1 Let (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ) be a measure-preserving deterministic system\nwhere \u03a3M contains all open balls of the metric space (M,dM), T is continuous\nat some point x \u2208 M , every open ball around x has positive measure, and\nthere is a set D \u2208 \u03a3M , \u00b5(D) > 0, with d(T (x), D) := inf{d(T (x),m) |m \u2208\nD} > 0. Then there is some \u03b5 > 0 for which there is no Bernoulli process to\nwhich (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ) is \u03b5-congruent.\nFor a proof, see subsection 6.2.15\nGiven this result, it is natural to ask (which, incidentally, Smith (1998)\ndoes not do) whether deterministic systems in science can be replaced at ev-\nery observation level by other stochastic processes in science. The answer is\n\u2018yes\u2019. Besides, all one needs are irreducible and aperiodic Markov processes,\nwhich are widely used in science. These Markov processes are often regarded\nas random; in particular, Bernoulli processes are regarded as the most ran-\ndom processes and Markov processes as the next most random (Ornstein and\nWeiss, 1991, p. 38 and p. 66).\nFor Markov processes the next outcome depends only on the previous\noutcome.\nDefinition 13 {Zt; t \u2208 Z} is a Markov process if and only if (i) its outcome\nspace consists of a finite number of symbols M\u00af := {s1, . . . , sN}, N \u2208 N, and\n\u03a3M\u00af = P(M\u00af); (ii) P{Zt+1 = sj |Zt, Zt\u22121 . . . , Zk} = P{Zt+1 = sj |Zt} for any\nt, any k \u2208 Z, k \u2264 t, and any sj \u2208 M\u00af ; and (iii) {Zt; t \u2208 Z} is stationary\nDefine P k(si, sj) := P{Zn+k = si |Zn = sj} for k \u2208 Z. A Markov process\nis irreducible exactly if it cannot be split into two processes because each\noutcome can be reached from all other outcomes; formally: for every si, sj \u2208\n14This theorem also holds for generalised Bernoulli processes\u2014stochastic processes con-\nsisting of independent and identically distributed random variables whose outcome space\nneed not be finite. That is, under the assumption of Theorem 1, there is an \u03b5 > 0 for\nwhich there is no generalised Bernoulli process to which (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ) is \u03b5-congruent\n(cf. Remark 1 at the end of subsection 6.2).\n15A deterministic system which is replaced at every observation level by a Bernoulli\nprocess will be measure-preserving. Hence it suffices to concentrate on measure-preserving\nsystems.\n21\nM\u00af there is a k \u2208 N such that P k(si, sj) > 0. A Markov process is aperiodic\nexactly if for every possible outcome there is no periodic pattern in which the\nprocess can visit that outcome. Mathematically, the period dsi of an outcome\nsi \u2208 M\u00af, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N , is defined by di = gcd{n \u2265 1 |P n(si, si) > 0} where\n\u2018gcd\u2019 denotes the greatest common divisor. An outcome si \u2208 M\u00af is aperiodic\nif and only if di = 1, and the Markov process is aperiodic if and only if all\nits possible outcomes are aperiodic.\nThe following theorem shows that Bernoulli systems (cf. Definition 11)\ncan be replaced at every observation level by irreducible and aperiodic Markov\nprocesses.\nTheorem 2 Let (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ) be a Bernoulli system where the metric space\n(M,dM) is separable\n16 and \u03a3M contains all open balls of (M,dM). Then for\nany \u03b5 > 0 there is an irreducible and aperiodic Markov process such that\n(M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ) is \u03b5-congruent to this Markov process.\nFor a proof, see subsection 6.3. The assumptions in this theorem are fulfilled\nby all Bernoulli systems in science.\nThe following theorem shows that, for our notion of replacement at every\nobservation level, also only Bernoulli systems can be replaced by irreducible\nand aperiodic Markov processes.\nTheorem 3 The deterministic representation of any irreducible and aperi-\nodic Markov process is a Bernoulli system.\nFor a proof of this deep theorem, see Ornstein (1974, pp. 45\u201347).\nFor example, consider the baker\u2019s system (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ) (Example 2),\nwhere dM is the Euclidean metric. It is a Bernoulli system. Thus for every\n\u03b5 > 0 there is a Markov process such that the baker\u2019s system is \u03b5-congruent\nto this Markov process. Let me explain this. For an arbitrary \u03b5 > 0 choose\nn \u2208 N such that\n\u221a\n2\n2n\n< \u03b5. Consider the partition \u03b1n = {\u03b11, \u03b12, . . . , \u03b122n} :=\n{[0, 1\n2n\n)\u00d7[0, 1\n2n\n)\\\u0393, [0, 1\n2n\n)\u00d7[ 1\n2n\n,\n2\n2n\n)\\\u0393, . . . , [2\nn \u2212 1\n2n\n, 1]\u00d7[2\nn \u2212 1\n2n\n, 1]\\\u0393}. (7)\n16(M,dM ) is separable if and only if there exists a countable set M\u00a8 = {mn |n \u2208 N} with\nmn \u2208M such that every nonempty open subset of M contains at least one element of M\u00a8 .\n22\nNow let \u03a6\u03b1n(m) :=\n\u221122n\ni=1 o\u03b1i\u03c7\u03b1i(m), where\no\u03b11 = (\n\u221a\n2\n2n+1\n,\n\u221a\n2\n2n+1\n), o\u03b12 = (\n\u221a\n2\n2n+1\n,\n2 +\n\u221a\n2\n2n+1\n), . . . ,\no\u03b122n = (\n2n+1 \u2212 2 +\u221a2\n2n+1\n,\n2n+1 \u2212 2 +\u221a2\n2n+1\n). (8)\nIt is not hard to see that {\u03a6\u03b1n(T t); t \u2208 Z} is an irreducible and aperi-\nodic Markov process whose deterministic representation is isomorphic to\n(M,\u03a3, \u00b5, T ). (M,\u03a3, \u00b5, T ) is \u03b5-congruent to this Markov process since\ndM(m,\u03a6\u03b1n(m)) \u2264\n\u221a\n2\n2n\n< \u03b5 for all m \u2208M. (9)\nRecall that irreducible and aperiodic Markov processes are widely used in\nscience, and they are even regarded as being second most random. Also recall\nthat several deterministic systems in science are Bernoulli systems (subsec-\ntion 4.1). Hence Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 show that irreducible and ape-\nriodic Markov processes are the most random stochastic processes which are\nneeded in order to replace deterministic systems at every observation level.\nThis implies that the conjecture advanced at the beginning of this subsection\nis wrong: it is possible to replace measure-theoretic deterministic systems in\nscience at every observation level by stochastic processes in science.\n4.2.2 Previous philosophical discussion\nLet me discuss the previous philosophical papers about the topic of this sec-\ntion. Suppes and de Barros (1996) and Suppes (1999) discuss an instance of\nTheorem 2, namely that for discrete versions of billiards with convex obsta-\ncles and for any \u03b5 > 0 there is a Markov process such that the billiard system\nis \u03b5-congruent to this Markov process. Suppes (1993) (albeit with only half\na page on the topic of this section) and Winnie (1998) discuss the theorem\nthat some continuous-time deterministic systems can be replaced at every\nobservation level by semi-Markov processes.\nSuppes and de Barros (1996, p. 196), Winnie (1998, p. 317) and Suppes\n(1999, p. 181\u2013182) claim that the philosophical significance of these results is\nthat for chaotic motion and every observation level one can choose between\na deterministic description in science and a stochastic description. For in-\nstance, Suppes and de Barros (1996, p. 196) comment on the significance of\nthese results:\n23\nWhat is fundamental is that independent of this variation of\nchoice of examples or experiments is that [sic] when we do have\nchaotic phenomena [...] then we are in a position to choose either\na deterministic or stochastic model.\nHowever, I submit that these claims are weak, and the \u03b5-congruence re-\nsults show more. As argued in section 3.1, the basic results on observa-\ntional equivalence already show that for many deterministic systems, includ-\ning many deterministic systems in science, the following holds: for any finite-\nvalued observation function one can choose between a nontrivial stochastic or\na deterministic description. This implies that, in a way, many deterministic\nsystems can be replaced at every observation level by nontrivial stochastic\nprocesses. And as one would expect, given a deterministic system in sci-\nence which satisfies the assumption of Proposition 1, for every \u03b5 > 0 there\nis a nontrivial stochastic process which is \u03b5-congruent to the system. For\nbasically all ergodic deterministic systems in science have a generating par-\ntition (Definition 14).17 Besides, one easily sees the following: assume that\n(M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ) is an ergodic measure-preserving deterministic system with\na generating partition, and that (M,dM) is separable and \u03a3M contains all\nopen balls of (M,dM). Then for every \u03b5 > 0 there is a stochastic process\n{\u03a6(T t); t \u2208 Z}, where \u03a6 : M \u2192 M is finite-valued, which is \u03b5-congruent\nto the system.18 And similar results for chaotic systems were known long\nbefore the \u03b5-congruence results were proved (cf. subsection 3.1). Hence the\nfact that at every observation level one has a choice between a determin-\nistic description in science and a stochastic process was known long before\nthe \u03b5-congruence results were proved, and so cannot be the philosophical sig-\n17Basically all deterministic systems in science have finite Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy;\nand ergodic systems with finite Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy have a generating partition (cf.\nPetersen, 1983, p. 244; Ornstein and Weiss, 1991, p. 19).\n18Let \u03b5 > 0. Since (M,dM ) is separable, there exists a r \u2208 N and mi \u2208 M , 1 \u2264\ni \u2264 r, such that \u00b5(M \\ \u222ari=1B(mi, \u03b52 )) < \u03b52 (B(m, \u03b5) is the ball of radius \u03b5 around m).\nLet \u03b1 be a generating partition. Then for each B(mi, \u03b52 ) there is an ni \u2208 N and a Ci\nof union of elements in \u2228nij=\u2212niT j(\u03b1) such that \u00b5((B(mi, \u03b52 ) \\ Ci) \u222a (Ci \\ B(mi, \u03b52 )) <\n\u03b5\n2r . Define n := max{ni}, \u03b2 := {\u03b21, . . . , \u03b2l} := \u2228nj=\u2212nT j(\u03b1) and \u03a6 :=\n\u2211l\ni=1 oi\u03c7\u03b2i with\noi \u2208 \u03b2i. \u03a6 is finite-valued and, since \u03b2 is generating, (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ) is isomorphic via \u03c6\nto the deterministic representation (M2,\u03a3M2 , \u00b52, T2,\u03a60) of the stochastic process Zt :=\n{\u03a6(T t); t \u2208 Z} (Petersen, 1983, p. 274). And, by construction, dM (x,\u03a60(\u03c6(x))) < \u03b5 except\nfor a set in M smaller than \u03b5.\n24\nnificance of these results as claimed by these authors.19 As I have argued\nin subsection 4.2.1, the significance of the \u03b5-congruence results is something\nstronger: namely that it is possible to replace deterministic systems in science\nat every observation level by stochastic processes in science.\nFurthermore, Suppes and de Barros (1996), Winnie (1998) and Suppes\n(1999) do not seem to be aware that also for non-chaotic systems there is a\nchoice between a deterministic and a stochastic description. To show this, I\ndo not have to discuss the hard question of how to define chaos. It will suffice\nto show that Proposition 1 also applies to systems which are uncontroversially\nneither chaotic nor locally chaotic. Consider the measure-preserving deter-\nministic system (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ) where M := [0, 1) represents the unit circle,\ni.e. each m \u2208 M represents the point e2pimi, \u03a3M is the Lebesgue \u03c3-algebra, \u00b5\nis the Lebesgue measure, and T is the rotation T (m) := m+\u03b1 (mod 1), where\n\u03b1 \u2208 R is irrational. It is uncontroversial that this system is neither chaotic\nnor locally chaotic because all solutions are stable, i.e. nearby solutions stay\nclose for all times. However, one easily sees that it satisfies the assumption of\nProposition 1.20 Consequently, this deterministic system is replaced at every\nobservation level by a nontrivial stochastic process.21\nThere remains the question: if one can choose between a deterministic\nsystem and a stochastic process, which description is preferable? Winnie\n(1998, pp. 317\u2013318) dismisses Suppes\u2019s (1993, p. 254) claim that in the case\nof the \u03b5-congruence results both descriptions are equally good. Winnie argues\nthat the deterministic description is preferable: assume a stochastic process\nreplaces a deterministic system for the current observation level. At some\npoint in the future the observational accuracy may be so fine that another\n19The reader should also be warned that there are some technical lacunae in Suppes and\nde Barros (1996) and Suppes (1999). For instance, according to their definition, any two\nsystems whatsoever are \u03b5-congruent (let the metric space simply consist of one element).\nAlso, these authors do not seem to be aware that the continuous-time \u03b5-congruence re-\nsults require the motion to be a Bernoulli flow and so do not generally hold for ergodic\nsystems. And in these papers it is wrongly assumed that the notions of isomorphism\nand \u03b5-congruence require that the deterministic system is looked at through an observa-\ntion function (Suppes and de Barros, 1996, p. 195\u2013196, p. 200; p. 198-200; Suppes, 1999,\np. 192, p. 195; pp. 189\u2013192).\n20This is so because any such deterministic system with irrational \u03b1 is ergodic (Petersen\n1983, p. 49).\n21This example can be generalised: any rationally independent rotation on a torus is\nuncontroversially non-chaotic but fulfills the assumption of Proposition 1 (cf. Petersen,\n1983, p. 51).\n25\nstochastic process will be needed to replace the deterministic system, and so\non. Because there is in principle no limitation on the observational accuracy,\nthere is no stochastic process that one can be sure, for practical purposes,\nwill always give the same predictions as the deterministic system. Hence the\ndeterministic description is preferable.\nHowever, I think neither Winnie\u2019s (1998) nor Suppes\u2019 (1993) view is ten-\nable. In a way, if the phenomenon under consideration is really stochastic,\nthe stochastic description is preferable, even if the stochasticity is at a small\nscale and thus not observable. Likewise, if the phenomenon is really deter-\nministic, the deterministic description is preferable. Now assume one cannot\nknow for sure whether the phenomenon is deterministic or stochastic. Which\ndescription is then preferable in the sense of being preferable relative to our\ncurrent knowledge and evidence? The answer depends on many factors, such\nas the kind of phenomenon under consideration, theories about fundamental\nphysics, etc. And it may well be that the stochastic description is preferable\nif, for instance, a fundamental theory suggests this and one aims for a de-\nscription at the most fundamental level. To sum up, neither Winnie\u2019s nor\nSuppes\u2019 view is tenable, and the question of which description is preferable\nneeds more careful examination.\n5 Conclusion\nThe central question of this paper has been: are deterministic and indeter-\nministic descriptions observationally equivalent in the sense that determin-\nistic descriptions, when observed, and indeterministic descriptions give the\nsame predictions? I have tackled it for discrete-time stochastic processes\nand measure-theoretic deterministic systems, both of which are ubiquitous\nin science.\nI have demonstrated that every stochastic process is observationally equiv-\nalent to a deterministic system, and that many deterministic systems are\nobservationally equivalent to stochastic processes. Still, one might guess\nthat the measure-theoretic deterministic systems which are observationally\nequivalent to stochastic processes in science do not include any deterministic\nsystems in science. I have shown this to be false because some determinis-\ntic systems in science even produce Bernoulli processes. Despite this, one\nmight guess that measure-preserving deterministic systems in science cannot\ngive the same predictions at every observation level as stochastic processes\n26\nin science. I have shown that there is indeed a limitation on observational\nequivalence, namely deterministic systems in science cannot give the same\npredictions at every observation level as Bernoulli processes. However, the\nguess is still wrong because I have shown (one of the \u03b5-congruence results)\nthat several deterministic systems in science give the same predictions at ev-\nery observation level as Markov processes. Therefore, even kinds of stochastic\nprocesses and kinds of deterministic systems which intuitively seem to give\nvery different predictions are observationally equivalent.\nFurthermore, I have criticised the previous philosophical literature, namely\nSuppes and de Barros (1996), Winnie (1998) and Suppes (1999). They ar-\ngue that the philosophical significance of the \u03b5-congruence results is that for\nchaotic motion one can choose at every observation level between a stochastic\nor a deterministic description. However, this is already shown by the basic\nresults in subsection 3.1. The philosophical significance of the \u03b5-congruence\nresult is really something stronger, namely, that there are deterministic sys-\ntems in science that give the same predictions at every observation level as\nstochastic processes in science. Furthermore, these authors seem not to be\naware that there are also uncontroversially non-chaotic deterministic systems\nwhich can be replaced at every observation level by stochastic processes.\n6 Appendix: Proofs\n6.1 Proof of Proposition 1\nProposition 1 Assume that the deterministic system (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ) is er-\ngodic and that there does not exist an n \u2208 N and a C \u2208 \u03a3M , 0 < \u00b5(C) < 1,\nsuch that, except for a set of measure zero, T n(C) = C. Then for every\nnontrivial finite-valued observation function \u03a6 :M \u2192MO and the stochastic\nprocess {Zt := \u03a6(T t); t \u2208 Z} the following holds: there is an oi \u2208 MO such\nthat for all oj \u2208MO, P{Zt+1=oj |Zt=oi} < 1.\nProof : I have not found a proof of this result in the literature and thus\nprovide one here. Notice that it suffices to prove the following:\n(\u2217) Assume that (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ) is ergodic and that it is not the\ncase that there exists an n \u2208 N and a C \u2208 \u03a3M , 0 < \u00b5(C) < 1, such\nthat, except for a set of measure zero, T n(C) = C. Then for any\n27\nnontrivial partition \u03b1 = {\u03b11, . . . , \u03b1n} there is an i \u2208 {1, . . . , n}\nsuch that for all j, 1\u2264j\u2264n, \u00b5(T (\u03b1i)\\\u03b1j)>0.\nFor recall that any finite observation function has a corresponding parti-\ntion (cf. subsection 3.1). Hence the conclusion of (\u2217) implies that for any\nnontrivial finite observation function \u03a6 : M \u2192 MO there is an outcome\noi \u2208 MO := \u222ank=1ok, n \u2208 N, such that for all possible outcomes oj \u2208 MO it\nfollows that P{Zt+1 = oj |Zt = oi} < 1, t \u2208 Z.\nSo assume that the conclusion of (\u2217) does not hold, i.e. there exists a\nnontrivial partition \u03b1 such that for each \u03b1i there exists an \u03b1j with, except\nfor a set of measure zero, T (\u03b1i) \u2286 \u03b1j.\nCase 1 : for all i there is a j such that, except for a set of measure zero,\nT (\u03b1i) = \u03b1j. Then ergodicity implies that \u03b11 is mapped, except for a set of\nmeasure zero, onto all \u03b1k, 2 \u2264 k \u2264 n, before being mapped onto itself. But\nthis contradicts the assumption that it is not the case that there exists an\nn \u2208 N and a C \u2208 \u03a3M , 0 < \u00b5(C) < 1, such that, except for a set of measure\nzero, T n(C) = C.\nCase 2 : for some i there is a j with, except for a set of measure zero,\nT (\u03b1i) \u2282 \u03b1j and \u00b5(\u03b1i) < \u00b5(\u03b1j). Ergodicity implies that there exists a k \u2208 N\nsuch that, except for a set of measure zero, T k(\u03b1j) \u2286 \u03b1i. Hence it holds that\n\u00b5(\u03b1j) \u2264 \u00b5(\u03b1i), yielding a contradiction, viz. \u00b5(\u03b1i) < \u00b5(\u03b1j) \u2264 \u00b5(\u03b1i).\n6.2 Proof of Theorem 1\nTheorem 1 Let (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ) be a deterministic system where \u03a3M contains\nall open balls of the metric space (M,dM), T is continuous at a point x \u2208M ,\nevery open ball around x has positive measure, and there is a set D \u2208 \u03a3M ,\n\u00b5(D) > 0, with d(T (x), D) := inf{d(T (x),m) |m \u2208 D} > 0. Then there is\nsome \u03b5 > 0 for which there is no Bernoulli process to which (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ) is\n\u03b5-congruent.\nProof : I have not found a proof of this result in the literature and thus\nprovide one here.\nFor m \u2208 M , E \u2286 M and \u03b5 > 0 let the ball of radius \u03b5 around m be\nB(m, \u03b5) := {y \u2208 M | d(y,m) < \u03b5} and let B(E, \u03b5) := \u222am\u2208EB(m, \u03b5). Since\nd(T (x), D) > 0, one can choose \u03b3 > 0 and \u03b2 > 0 such that B(T (x), 2\u03b3) \u2229\nB(D, 2\u03b2) = \u2205. Because T is continuous at x, one can choose \u03b4 > 0 such\nthat T (B(x, 4\u03b4)) \u2286 B(T (x), \u03b3). Recall that \u00b5(B(x, 2\u03b4)) = \u03c11 > 0 and that\n28\n\u00b5(D) = \u03c12 > 0. Let \u03b5 > 0 be such that \u03b5 <\n\u03c11\u03c12\n8\n, \u03b5 < \u03b4, \u03b5 < \u03b2 and \u03b5 < \u03b3. I\nam going to show that there is no Bernoulli process such that (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T )\nis \u03b5-congruent to this Bernoulli process.\nAssume that (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ) is \u03b5-congruent to a Bernoulli process, and\nlet (\u2126,\u03a3\u2126, \u03bd, S,\u03a60) be the deterministic representation of this Bernoulli pro-\ncess. This implies that (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ) is isomorphic (via \u03c6 : M\u02c6 \u2192 \u2126\u02c6) to\nthe Bernoulli shift (\u2126,\u03a3\u2126, \u03bd, S) and hence that (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ) is a Bernoulli\nsystem. Let \u03b1\u03a60 := {\u03b11\u03a60 . . . \u03b1s\u03a60}, s \u2208 N, be the partition of (\u2126,\u03a3\u2126, \u03bd) corre-\nsponding to the observation function \u03a60 (cf. subsection 3.1). Let M\u02c7 :=M \\M\u02c6\nand \u2126\u02c7 := \u2126 \\ \u2126\u02c6.

Because\n(M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ) is \u03b5-congruent to (\u2126,\u03a3\u2126, \u03bd, S,\u03a60), I have \u00b5(C \u2229 D) \u2265 \u03c12\/2\nand \u00b5(C \u2229B(T (x), \u03b3)) < \u03b5.\nBecause (\u2126,\u03a3\u2126, \u03bd, S,\u03a60) is a Bernoulli process isomorphic to (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ),\nit must hold that \u00b5(T (Ai) \u2229 Cj) = \u00b5(Ai)\u00b5(Cj) for all i, j, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n,\n1 \u2264 j \u2264 k. Hence also \u00b5(T (A) \u2229 C) = \u00b5(A)\u00b5(C).

I say that a stochastic process {Zt; t \u2208 Z} is a generalised\nBernoulli process if and only if (i) it takes values in an arbitrary measur-\nable space (M\u00af,\u03a3M\u00af); (ii) the random variables Zt have the same distribution\nfor all t; and (iii) {Zt; t \u2208 Z} are independent. A generalised Bernoulli shift\nis the deterministic representation of a generalised Bernoulli process. A gen-\neralised Bernoulli system is a deterministic system which is isomorphic to a\ngeneralised Bernoulli shift. Now it is important to note that Theorem 1 also\nholds for generalised Bernoulli processes, i.e.:\nTheorem 1* Let (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ) be a deterministic system where \u03a3M con-\n29\ntains all open balls of the metric space (M,dM), T is continuous at a point\nx \u2208 M , every open ball around x has positive measure, and there is a set\nD \u2208 \u03a3M , \u00b5(D) > 0, with d(T (x), D) := inf{d(T (x),m) |m \u2208 D} > 0. Then\nit is not the case that for all \u03b5 > 0 there is a generalised Bernoulli process\nsuch that (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ) is \u03b5-congruent to this generalised Bernoulli process.\nProof : the proof goes through as above when one considers generalised\nBernoulli processes instead of Bernoulli processes, generalised Bernoulli shifts\ninstead of Bernoulli shifts and generalised Bernoulli systems instead of Bernoulli\nsystems, and one definesA := \u03c6\u22121(\u03a6\u221210 (B(x, 3\u03b4))\\\u2126\u02c7) and C := \u03c6\u22121(\u03a6\u221210 (B(D, \u03b2))\\\n\u2126\u02c7). Clearly, because for a generalised Bernoulli process the random variables\nare independent, it still holds that \u00b5(T (A) \u2229 C) = \u00b5(A)\u00b5(C) and the proof\ngoes through as above.\n6.3 Proof of Theorem 2\nTheorem 2 Let (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ) be a Bernoulli system where the metric space\n(M,dM) is separable and \u03a3M contains all open balls of (M,dM). Then for\nany \u03b5 > 0 there is an irreducible and aperiodic Markov process such that\n(M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ) is \u03b5-congruent to this Markov process.\nProof : I have not found a proof of this result in the literature and thus\nprovide one here. I need the following definition.\nDefinition 14 A partition \u03b1 of (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ) is generating if and only if\nfor every A \u2208 \u03a3M there is an n \u2208 N and a set C of unions of elements in\n\u2228nj=\u2212nT j(\u03b1) such that \u00b5((A \\C)\u222a (C \\A)) < \u03b5 (cf. Petersen, 1983, p. 244).\nPer assumption, the deterministic system (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ) is isomorphic\nvia \u03c6 : M\u02c6 \u2192 \u2126\u02c6 to the deterministic representation (\u2126,\u03a3\u2126, \u03bd, S,\u03a60) of a\nBernoulli shift with outcome space M\u00af . Let \u03b1\u03a60 := {\u03b11\u03a60 . . . \u03b1k\u03a60}, k \u2208 N,\nbe the partition of (\u2126,\u03a3\u2126, \u03bd) corresponding to the observation function \u03a60\n(cf. subsection 3.1). Let M\u02c7 := M \\ M\u02c6 and \u2126\u02c7 := \u2126 \\ \u2126\u02c6. \u03c6\u22121(\u03b1\u03a60) :=\n{\u03c6\u22121(\u03b11\u03a60\\\u2126\u02c7)\u222aM\u02c7, \u03c6\u22121(\u03b12\u03a60\\\u2126\u02c7), . . . , \u03c6\u22121(\u03b1k\u03a60\\\u2126\u02c7)} is a partition of (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5).\nFor the partitions \u03b1 = {\u03b11, . . . , \u03b1n} and \u03b2 = {\u03b21, . . . , \u03b2n}, n \u2208 N, \u03b1 \u2228 \u03b2 is\nthe partition\n\u22c3\n1\u2264i,j\u2264n \u03b1i \u2229 \u03b2j. Clearly, if \u03b1 is a partition of M , T\u2212t\u03b1 :=\n{T\u2212t\u03b11, . . . , T\u2212t\u03b1n}, t \u2208 Z, are partitions.\nSince (M,dM) is separable, there exists an r \u2208 N and mi \u2208 M ,\n1 \u2264 i \u2264 r, such that \u00b5(M \\ \u222ari=1B(mi, \u03b52)) < \u03b52 . Because for a Bernoulli\n30\nsystem \u03a6\u22121(\u03b1\u03a60) is generating (Petersen, 1983, p. 275), for each B(mi,\n\u03b5\n2\n)\nthere is an ni \u2208 N and a Ci of union of elements in \u2228nij=\u2212niT j(\u03c6\u22121(\u03b1\u03a60))\nsuch that \u00b5(Di) <\n\u03b5\n2r\n, where Di := (B(mi,\n\u03b5\n2\n) \\ Ci) \u222a (Ci \\ B(mi, \u03b52)). De-\nfine n := max{ni}. For Q = {q1, . . . , ql} := \u2228nj=\u2212nSj(\u03b1\u03a60) let \u03a6Q0 : \u2126 \u2192\nM ; \u03a6Q0 (\u03c9) =\n\u2211l\ni=1 oi\u03c7qi(\u03c9), where oi \u2208 \u03c6\u22121(qi \\ \u2126\u02c7). Note that oi 6= oj for\ni 6= j, 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 l. Then\ndM(m,\u03a6\nQ\n0 (\u03c6(m))) < \u03b5 except for a set in M of measure < \u03b5. (10)\nNow let (X,\u03a3X , \u03bb, R,\u03980) be the deterministic representation of the stochas-\ntic process {\u03a6Q0 (St); t \u2208 Z} from (\u2126,\u03a3\u2126, \u03bd) to (M,\u03a3M). This process is a\nMarkov process since for any k \u2208 N and any A,B1, . . . , Bk \u2208 M\u00af2n+1,\n\u03bd({\u03c9 \u2208 \u2126 | (\u03c9\u2212n . . . \u03c9n) = A and (\u03c9\u2212n+1 . . . \u03c9n+1) = B1})\n\u03bd({\u03c9 \u2208 \u2126 | (\u03c9\u2212n+1 . . . \u03c9n+1) = B1}) = (11)\n\u03bd({\u03c9\u2208\u2126|(\u03c9\u2212n. . .\u03c9n)=A and(\u03c9\u2212n+1. . .\u03c9n+1)=B1,. . ., (\u03c9\u2212n+k. . .\u03c9n+k)=Bk})\n\u03bd({\u03c9\u2208\u2126|(\u03c9\u2212n+1. . .\u03c9n+1)=B1,. . ., (\u03c9\u2212n+k. . .\u03c9n+k)=Bk}) ,\nif \u03bd({\u03c9\u2208\u2126|(\u03c9\u2212n. . .\u03c9n)=A and(\u03c9\u2212n+1. . .\u03c9n+1)=B1,. . ., (\u03c9\u2212n+k. . .\u03c9n+k)=Bk})>0.\nBecause S is a shift, one sees that for all i, j, 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 l, there is\na k \u2265 1 such that P k(oi, oj) > 0, and hence that the Markov process is\nirreducible. One also sees that there exists an outcome oi, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 l, such\nthat P 1(oi, oi) > 0. Hence doi = 1; and since all outcomes of an irreducible\nMarkov process have the same periodicity (Cinlar, 1975, p. 131), it follows\nthat the Markov process is also aperiodic.\nConsider \u03c8 : \u2126 \u2192 X, \u03c8(\u03c9) = . . .\u03a6Q0 (S\u22121(\u03c9)),\u03a6Q0 (\u03c9),\u03a6Q0 (S(\u03c9)) . . .,\nfor \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126. Clearly, there is a set X\u02c6 \u2286 X with \u03bb(X\u02c6) = 1 such that\n\u03c8 : \u2126 \u2192 X\u02c6 is bijective and measure-preserving and R(\u03c8(\u03c9)) = \u03c8(S(\u03c9))\nfor all \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126. Hence (\u2126,\u03a3\u2126, \u03bd, S) is isomorphic to (X,\u03a3X , \u03bb, R) via \u03c8, and\nthus (M,\u03a3M , \u00b5, T ) is isomorphic to (X,\u03a3X , \u03bb, R) via \u03b8 = \u03c8(\u03c6). Now because\nof (10) it holds that\ndM(m,\u03980(\u03b8(m))) < \u03b5 except for a set in M of measure < \u03b5.
