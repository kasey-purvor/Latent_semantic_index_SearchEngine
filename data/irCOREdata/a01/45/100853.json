INTRODUCTION\nThe deformed axially symmetric rotor [1] is described by\na nonzero value of the quadrupole deformation, \u03b2o and \u03b3\nfixed at 0\u25e6. When quadratic small amplitude oscillations in\n\u03b2 and \u03b3 are allowed, then additional collective excitations\ncan occur. The most common of these are oscillations along\nthe symmetry axis (so called \u03b2 vibrations) or oscillations\nperpendicular to the symmetry axis (\u03b3 vibrations). The term\n\u201c\u03b2\u201d vibration is used here only as a label for the first excited\n0+ excitation, because, microscopically, such excitations are\nforbidden within a major shell [1]. The wave functions for\nthese states can be separated into the product of the intrinsic\nexcitations and the rotational motion. For B(E2) branching\nratios between bands, the intrinsic matrix elements cancel;\nthe ratio then depends only on the ratio of the squares of\nClebsch-Gordan coefficients, as given by the well-known\nAlaga rules [2].\nVery early on, simple predictions of the Alaga rules were\nobserved to be unfulfilled in most well-deformed nuclei, due to\na (small) breakdown of the adiabatic assumption. A traditional\nway of treating this nonadiabatic coupling is to consider\nbandmixing [3] among the ground, \u03b2, and \u03b3 bands. Usually,\nbandmixing is limited to a simple analysis in terms of \u0004K = 2\nmixing between the \u03b3 band and ground band. Attempts at\ninvolving the mixing of the \u03b2 and \u03b3 bands have been met with\nlimited success (see, for example, Ref. [4\u20136]).\nOne area in which the mixing between the \u03b3 and \u03b2\nvibrational states has been studied in great detail is the\ntungsten isotopes. Initial studies [7,8] involving a variety of\ndifferent models indicated a small mixing between the \u03b3 and\n\u03b2 bands. In addition, later calculations, based on improved\nmeasurements of B(E2) transition strengths, yielded absolute\nmatrix elements between the 2+\u03b3 and 2\n+\n\u03b2 states in 182W on the\norder of \u223c2 keV [9,10].\nThe Hf isotopic chain provides an additional interesting\nregion to study the evolution of two-level mixing among\nexcited 2+ states belonging to the \u03b3 and \u03b2 bands. The\nwell-deformed Hf nuclei (in particular 172Hf) are known\nto possess a set of high K isomers [11\u201313]. This gives\ngood support for axial symmetry in these nuclei and K , the\nprojection of angular momentum onto the symmetry axis,\ncan be considered an approximately good quantum number.\nFurthermore, the energies of the 2+\u03b3 and 2\n+\n\u03b2 levels in 166Hf\nthrough 174Hf [14\u201318] follow interesting trajectories, as shown\nin Fig. 1. These systematics show a crossing of the \u03b2 and \u03b3\nmodes and represent a unique situation in which the strength of\nthe interaction between the 2+\u03b3 and 2\n+\n\u03b2 states can be investigated\nas a function of the energy separation between the two levels,\nwith a near degeneracy precisely at 170Hf. Interactions between\nquadrupole intrinsic excitations are expected to be large near\nan (avoided) crossing, as studied in Ref. [19].\nThe purpose of this study is to measure the energies and\ndecay properties of low-lying levels in 170,172,174Hf populated\nin \u03b2+\/\u0002 decay. The present work makes use of high-statistics\ncoincidence data, leading to a substantial revision of the\nprevious 170,172Hf level schemes and improved measurements\nof intensities of low-lying transitions. The level scheme\nof 174Hf was confirmed, with a few additional transitions\nidentified. With sensitive \u03b3 -ray spectroscopy and improved\nmeasurements of \u03b3 -ray transition intensities, the above-\nmentioned interactions can be studied around the crossing\nregion using the high sensitivity of relative B(E2) values to\nvariations in the mixing.\n0556-2813\/2008\/77(5)\/054304(14) 054304-1 \u00a92008 The American Physical Society\nE.

The reaction products are emitted in\na forward solid angle cone, deposited on a 16-mm-wide\naluminized Kapton tape and transported periodically to the\ncenter of a superconducting coil. To prevent the primary beam\nfrom reaching the tape, a 3-mm-diameter gold plug was placed\nbetween the target and the tape. The tape was moved cyclically\nevery 15 min to optimize the observed decay from the parent\n170Ta (T1\/2 = 6.8 min) nuclei. 170Ta decays to 170Hf with a Q\nvalue of 6.1 MeV [16].\nThe \u03b3 rays were detected by a set of eight coaxial\nHPGe detectors positioned around the center of the coil. \u03b3 -\u03b3\ncoincidence data were acquired in event mode with a doubles\ntrigger. In the \u223c200-h experiment, 1.3 \u00d7 109 \u03b3 -\u03b3 coincidence\nevents were acquired. The original aim of this experiment on\n170Hf was a measurement of the g factor of the 2+1 state. This\nresult has been published [20] and here we report on the new\n\u03b3 -\u03b3 coincidence data obtained from that experiment.\nLow-spin states in 172,174Hf were populated in the \u03b2+\/\u0002\ndecay of 172,174Ta and studied through off-beam \u03b3 -ray spec-\ntroscopy. The parent 172Ta nuclei were produced through\nthe 165Ho(12C, 5n) reaction by bombarding a \u223c4.0-mg\/cm2\ntarget with a \u223c2 pnA, 80-MeV 12C beam. The parent 174Ta\nnuclei were produced through the 168Er(11B, 5n) reaction by\nbombarding a 3.5-mg\/cm2 target with a \u223c3 pnA, 65-MeV 11B\nbeam. Both beams were provided by the Yale ESTU tandem\naccelerator. The 172Hf (174Hf) experiment was performed with\na beam-on\/beam-off cycle of 120 (200) sec intervals. The T1\/2\nfor 172Ta decay is 36.8 min, with a Q value of 4.9 MeV [17]\nto 172Hf. The T1\/2 for 174Ta decay is 1.14 h, with a Q value of\n3.8 MeV [18] to 174Hf.\nDuring the beam-off cycle, \u03b3 rays were detected using eight\nCompton-suppressed segmented YRAST ball clover HPGe\ndetectors [21]. Both \u03b3 -ray singles and \u03b3 -\u03b3 coincidence data\nwere acquired in event mode. The 172Hf experiment yielded\n2.6 \u00d7 107 clover-clover coincidence events and 2.7 \u00d7 107\nclover singles events. The 174Hf experiment yielded 8.4 \u00d7 107\nclover-clover coincidence events and 6.3 \u00d7 107 clover singles\nevents.\nA. Levels in 170Hf\nThe level scheme obtained in the present work provided\nsubstantial modification to the current literature \u03b2+\/\u0002 decay\ndata [16] on 170Hf. The evaluated \u03b2-decay data are based on\na single previous \u03b2-decay measurement [22]. Here, nine new\nlevels are identified, no evidence is found for one previous\nproposed level, and the decay properties of some of the\nremaining levels are substantially modified. Table I lists the\nlevels populated in 170Hf and their \u03b3 decay. Because data\nwere collected with only a doubles trigger, the intensity of\nthe 101-keV, 2+1 \u2192 0+1 transition could not be determined.\nIn the following discussion, intensities are normalized to the\nintensity of the 221-keV, 4+1 \u2192 2+1 transition (I221 \u2261 100).\nThe complete level scheme deduced in the present work is\ngiven in Fig. 2. Spin and parity assignments are taken from the\nliterature [16] except where noted.\n1. (2+) level at 988 keV\nThis level was previously reported [16] to decay to the\n4+1 , 2\n+\n1 , and 0\n+\n1 levels through transitions of 666, 887, and\n988 keV, respectively. In the present work, a 988.04(6)-keV\ntransition to the 0+1 level and a 666.35(8)-keV transition to\nthe 4+1 level are observed with intensities similar to those\ngiven in the literature. No evidence is found for a 887-keV\ntransition to the 2+1 level. As illustrated in Fig. 3(a), a gate\non the 101-keV, 2+1 \u2192 0+1 transition finds no evidence for a\n887-keV transition with reported [16] intensity of 2.4(5). For\ncomparison, the 780-keV transition [with a reported intensity\nof 5.8(4)], which directly feeds the 2+1 level, is highlighted\nin Fig. 3(a). Figure 3(b) shows a summed spectrum gated on\nthe 437-keV and 710-keV transitions that populate the level\nat 988 keV. Strong coincidences are observed with the 666-\nand 988-keV depopulating transitions; however, no evidence\nis found for a 887-keV depopulating transition. In the present\nwork, we obtain a limit of <1.0 for the intensity of a 887-keV\ntransition to the 2+1 level. The observed transitions to the 0+\nand 4+ states are still consistent with a 2+ spin assignment for\nthis level.\n2. (4+) level at 1155 keV\nThis level was proposed in \u03b2 decay [22] on the basis of three\ndepopulating transitions, a 1054-keV transition to the 2+1 level,\na 835-keV transition to the 4+1 level, and a tentatively placed\ntransition of 512.5-keV to the 6+1 level. In the present work, we\nidentify a level at 1158.95(8) keV that we associate with the\nreported 1155-keV level. This identification is based on two\ndepopulating transitions.

As shown in Fig. 3(a), a gate on\nthe 101-keV, 2+1 \u2192 0+1 transition gives no evidence for a\n1058-keV transition with reported [16] intensity of 1.9(4). For\ncomparison, the 1127-keV transition [with a reported intensity\nof 3.2(3)], which directly feeds the 2+1 level, is highlighted in\nFig. 3(a). In the present work, we obtain a limit of <0.70 for\nthe intensity of a 1058-keV transition to the 2+1 level.\n3. (4+) level at 1219 keV\nThis level was proposed [22] in \u03b2 decay on the basis of\nthree depopulating transitions of 1120, 898, and 576.5 keV\nto the 2+1 , 4\n+\n1 , and 6\n+\n1 levels, respectively. The present\nexperiment finds a 1119.91(8)-keV transition in coincidence\nwith the 221-keV, 4+1 \u2192 2+1 transition, as shown in Fig. 6(a).\nFurthermore, the 1120-keV transition is coincident with only\nthe 101- and 221-keV transitions, as shown in Fig. 6(b). This\nprovides an alternate placement for the 1120-keV transition\nas depopulating a newly proposed level at 1442 keV and\ndirectly feeding the 4+1 level. As shown in Fig. 4, a gate on\nthe 221-keV, 4+1 \u2192 2+1 transition finds no coincidences with a\ntransition of 898 keV, reported [16] with an intensity of 0.9(3).\nFor comparison, the 906-keV transition highlighted in Fig. 4\ndoes feed the 4+1 level with a reported intensity of 2.4(4). As\nshown in Fig. 5, a gate on the 321-keV, 6+1 \u2192 4+1 transition\nfinds no coincidences with a 577-keV transition, reported with\nan intensity of 1.9(3). As a reference, the 585-keV transition\nhighlighted in Fig. 5 does feed the 6+1 level with a reported\nintensity of 2.1(3). With no evidence for any of the proposed\ndepopulating transitions, we eliminate the level at 1219 keV.\nNine new levels are identified in 170Hf above 1400 keV\nbased on the observation of several depopulating transitions.\nThese levels and their decay are summarized in Table I.\nB. Levels in 172Hf\nThe level scheme obtained in the present work for\n172Hf is also a substantial revision of the current litera-\nture \u03b2+\/\u0002 decay [17] data on 172Hf. The \u03b2-decay data of\n172Hf are based on a single previous \u03b2-decay study [23].\nHere, 10 new levels are identified, no evidence is found\nfor one previously proposed level, and many of the previ-\nously unplaced transitions are now given definite placements\nin the level scheme based on the new coincidence data.\nTable II lists the levels populated in 172Hf and their \u03b3 decay.\nIn the following discussion, intensities are normalized to the\nintensity of the 214-keV, 4+1 \u2192 2+1 transition (I214 \u2261 100).\nThe 172Hf level scheme for levels below 1500 keV deduced in\n054304-4\nENHANCED MIXING OF INTRINSIC STATES IN . . .

These two transitions are confirmed and found to\nhave intensities consistent with those given in the literature.\nAn additional transition from this level to the 4+1 state is\nalso observed. A summed gate on the 427- and 564-keV\ntransitions that feed the level at 1076 keV is given in Fig. 10.\nStrong coincidences are observed with the 980- and 1076-keV\ntransitions, as well as a weak coincidence with a 766-keV\ntransition. A 766.2(1)-keV line with intensity 0.40(1) is now\nplaced as a transition from the level at 1076 keV to the 4+1 level.\nThe observation of the transition to the 4+1 state confirms the\nprevious spin assignment of 2+ for this level. We note that\nthe 766-keV line was established as a doublet in the present\nwork, as also depopulating a level at 1394 keV. This level is\ndiscussed separately below.\n3. 4+ level at 1130 keV\nThis level was previously observed [23] to decay to the\n2+1 , 4\n+\n1 , and 6\n+\n1 levels by transitions of 1035, 821, and\n501 keV, respectively, and assigned as the 4+ member of the 0+2\nband.

(4+) level at 1305 keV\nThe level at 1305 keV was previously proposed [23] to\ndecay by transitions of 995 and 1209 keV to the 4+1 and\n2+1 levels, respectively, and assigned as the 4+ member of\nthe \u03b3 band. These depopulating transitions are confirmed in\nthe present experiment. An additional 676-keV depopulating\ntransition is observed to the 6+1 level. A 676-keV transition\nis found to be in coincidence with the 319-keV, 6+1 \u2192 4+1\ntransition, as shown in Fig. 8. The observation of a new\ntransition decaying to the 6+1 level confirms the previous spin\nassignment of 4+ to this level.\n5. 0+ level at 1335 keV\nThis level was identified in \u03b2 decay [23] on the basis of two\ndepopulating transitions of 1241 and 383 keV to the 2+1 and\n2+2 levels, respectively. These transitions were confirmed in\nthe present work.

The present coincidence data find no\nevidence for a 260-keV transition from this level to the level\nat 1076 keV.\n6. Level at 1373 keV\nA level at 1373 keV was previously tentatively proposed\n[17] on the basis of a single depopulating transition of\n1277 keV to the 2+1 state. The placement and intensity of\nthis transition were confirmed in the present experiment. The\nexistence of this level is further supported by the observation\nof an additional depopulating transition of 421 keV to the\n953-keV level.\n7. Level at 1394 keV\nA level at 1394 keV was previously observed only in the\n(\u03b1, xn) reaction [17] with a single depopulating transition of\n766 keV to the 6+1 state. In the present work, we also observed a\n766-keV transition in coincidence with the 319-keV, 6+1 \u2192 4+1\ntransition, as shown in Fig. 8. Thus, we place a 765.8(2)-keV\ntransition with intensity 0.42(4) depopulating a level at\n1394 keV, which is mostly likely associated with the previously\nobserved level at 1394 keV in the (\u03b1, xn) reaction.\nC. Levels in 174Hf\n174Hf has been studied previously in significant detail\nin four different \u03b2-decay experiments [24\u201327]. The present\nexperiment finds mostly agreement with the literature data\non 174Hf. The level scheme of 174Hf populated in \u03b2 decay\nextends up to 3.2 MeV with many of the levels above 2 MeV\ndecaying by high-energy \u03b3 rays (E\u03b3 > 2 MeV). In the present\nexperiment, the \u03b3 -ray detection energy range was limited\nto a maximum of 2 MeV and thus we have no ability to\nconfirm a large portion of the level scheme. For that reason, we\nlimit the discussion to levels below 1500 keV, which includes\nall the relevant levels for investigating the low-spin members\nof the \u03b3 and \u03b2 bands. Table III lists the levels below 1500 keV\npopulated in 174Hf and their \u03b3 decay. Following the convention\nof Ref. [18], intensities are normalized to the intensity of the\n206-keV, 4+1 \u2192 2+1 transition (I206 \u2261 1000). The level scheme\nfor 174Hf for levels below 1500 keV deduced in the present\nwork is given in Fig. 12. Spin and parity assignments are taken\nfrom Ref. [18].\n1. 4+ level at 1062 keV\nThe level at 1062 keV was previously reported [18] to\ndecay by three transitions of 971, 765, and 454 keV to the\n2+1 , 4\n+\n1 , and 6\n+\n1 levels, respectively. These transitions were\nobserved and confirmed to have intensities consistent with\nthose from the literature. An additional depopulating transition\nof 162-keV to the 2+2 state at 900 keV was also observed in\nthe present experiment. Support for this transition is given in\nFig. 13. A 162-keV transition is found in coincidence with\nthe 809-keV, 2+2 \u2192 2+1 transition, which depopulates the level\n054304-9\nE. A. MCCUTCHAN et al.

DISCUSSION\nIn following, we examine the extent to which the Hf\nisotopic chain can be explained in terms of two-level mixing\nbetween \u03b2 and \u03b3 vibrational 2+ excitations. This first requires\nassignments of the observed levels to members of the \u03b2\nand \u03b3 excitations. These assignments are taken from the\nliterature [14,15] and compiled data [16\u201318]. We start by\nconsidering the branching ratios from the excited 2+ states,\nbecause electromagnetic transition strengths provide the most\nstringent test of structure. Plotted in Fig. 15 are the branching\nratios B(E2; 2+i \u2192 0+1 )\/B(E2; 2+i \u2192 4+1 ) for 166Hf through\n174Hf. This branching ratio was chosen because it involves\npure E2 transitions, so knowledge of the multipole mixing\nratio is not necessary and also because the Alaga predictions\nare quite different: 14.3 for decay from the 2+\u03b3 level and 0.39\nfor decay from the 2+\u03b2 level.\nThe values shown in Fig. 15 confirm the assumption of\ntwo-level mixing between the 2+\u03b2 and 2+\u03b3 levels. In 166Hf\nand 168Hf, the 2+3 levels have values for the branching ratio\nsimilar to the 2+\u03b2 Alaga limit, whereas the 2\n+\n2 branching ratios\n(although only lower limits) are significantly larger, suggesting\nthey correspond to the 2+\u03b3 state. At 170Hf, where the energies\nof the 2+\u03b2 and 2+\u03b3 levels are nearly equal, enhanced mixing of\nthese states is expected and both branching ratios are rather\nsmall. Above 170Hf, the character of the excited 2+ states\nreverses, with 2+3 becoming the 2+\u03b3 excitation (large values for\nthe branching ratio) and the 2+2 resembling the decay of the \u03b2\nexcitation (small values for the branching ratio).\nBeyond the qualitative analysis given in Fig. 15, we\nalso consider a more rigorous treatment through the explicit\nbandmixing formalism [3]. Incorporating both \u03b3 -ground and\n\u03b3 -\u03b2 mixing, the B(E2) branching ratios from the \u03b3 band to\nthe ground band are given by [3]\nB(E2; 2+\u03b3 \u2192 0+1 )\nB(E2; 2+\u03b3 \u2192 4+1 )\n= 14.3 [1 \u2212 Z\u03b3 + 2Z\u03b2\u03b3 ]\n2\n[1 + 9Z\u03b3 + 12Z\u03b2\u03b3 ]2 (1)\nB(E2; 2+\u03b3 \u2192 2+1 )\nB(E2; 2+\u03b3 \u2192 0+1 )\n= 1.43[1 + Z\u03b3 \u2212 2Z\u03b2\u03b3 ]\n2\n[1 \u2212 Z\u03b3 + 2Z\u03b2\u03b3 ]2 , (2)\nwhere Z\u03b3 is a measure of the mixing between the ground and\n\u03b3 bands and Z\u03b2\u03b3 is a measure of the mixing between the\n\u03b3 and \u03b2 bands. The correction factors for the B(E2; 2+\u03b3 \u2192\n2+1 )\/B(E2; 2+\u03b3 \u2192 4+1 ) branching ratio can be obtained from\nthe ratio of Eqs. (1) and (2).\nBecause the odd spin members of the \u03b3 band do not mix\nwith the \u03b2 band, the branching ratio from the 3+ of the \u03b3 band\ndepends only on the mixing parameter Z\u03b3 given by [3]\nB(E2; 3+\u03b3 \u2192 2+1 )\nB(E2; 3+\u03b3 \u2192 4+1 )\n= 2.5 [1 \u2212 Z\u03b3 ]\n2\n[1 + 6Z\u03b3 ]2 . (3)\nEquation (3) is first used to extract a value for Z\u03b3 . Then\nwith the extracted Z\u03b3 value, Eqs. (1) and (2) are used to\ndetermine a value of Z\u03b2\u03b3 . The values of Z\u03b3 and Z\u03b2\u03b3 are\nsummarized in Table IV for 168Hf through 174Hf. For determin-\ning Z\u03b2\u03b3 , all possible branching ratios from the 2+\u03b3 level were\nconsidered.\nIn the case of 168Hf, the 2+\u03b3 \u2192 4+1 transition is not observed\nand reported with only an upper limit. The upper limit is used\nin the second column of Table IV, giving inconsistent values\nof Z\u03b2\u03b3 . If, however, the upper limit is reduced by a factor of\n4 (effectively multiplying the first and last branching ratios\nby a factor of 4) all the Z\u03b2\u03b3 values converge to a similar\nvalue. For both 172,174Hf, the E2\/M1 mixing ratio has not\nbeen measured for the 2+\u03b3 \u2192 2+1 transition.

Where the \u03b3 band\nis below the \u03b2 band, as in 168Hf, Z\u03b2\u03b3 is negative and rather\nlarge. In 170Hf, where 2+\u03b2 and 2+\u03b3 are nearly degenerate, the Z\u03b2\u03b3\nvalues clearly indicate considerable mixing. The fact that they\nare so large also suggests that simple first-order perturbation\nanalysis does not apply in this case. In 172Hf and 174Hf, where\nthe \u03b3 band rises above the \u03b2 band, the Z\u03b2\u03b3 values are positive\nand show the trend of decreasing in magnitude as the energy\nseparation between the 2+\u03b3 and 2\n+\n\u03b2 states increases.\nFrom these Z\u03b2\u03b3 values, a value for the absolute mixing\nmatrix element between the 2+\u03b2 and 2+\u03b3 excitations can be\ndetermined.

The points for 2+2 in 166Hf\nand 168Hf are lower limits due to the nonobservation of the 2+2 \u2192 4+1\ntransition (reported with an upper limit on intensity).\nwhere Q\u03b2(\u03b3 ) =\n\u221a\nB(E2; 2+\u03b2(\u03b3 ) \u2192 0+1 ). These values have been\nmeasured in 174Hf [18], with B(E2; 2+\u03b3 \u2192 0+1 ) = 4.8(22) W.u.\nand B(E2; 2+\u03b2 \u2192 0+1 ) = 2.1(6). Taking these as representative\nvalues also for the neighboring Hf nuclei gives \u0002\u2032\u03b2\u03b3 \u223c 3Z\u03b2\u03b3 .\nIn the limit of small mixing, the mixing amplitude (ampli-\ntude of unperturbed \u03b2 state in \u03b3 state) can be written as\n\u0002\u2032\u03b2\u03b3 (J ) \u223c\n\u3008\u03c6\u03b2(J )|V\u0004K=2|\u03c6\u03b3 (J )\u3009\n[E\u03b3 (J ) \u2212 E\u03b2(J )]unp \u2261\nV\u03b3\u03b2\n\u0004E\u03b3\u03b2\n, (5)\nwhere for the sake of simplicity, we have neglected the\ndifference between perturbed and unperturbed spacings. Using\nEqs. (4) and (5) along with an average of the Z\u03b2\u03b3 values given\nin Table IV, we obtain the following values for the absolute\nmixing matrix element between the 2+\u03b2 and 2+\u03b3 excitations:\n168Hf : V\u03b3\u03b2 \u223c 40 keV\n172Hf : V\u03b3\u03b2 \u223c 30 keV\n174Hf : V\u03b3\u03b2 \u223c 35 keV,\nwhich are approximately constant across the isotopes but\nan order of magnitude larger than those extracted in the\nneighboring W isotopes.\nWe note that in the above analysis, we have assumed that\nthe perturbation to the experimental B(E2) branching ratios\narises from mixing only with the ground and \u03b2 bands. In\nfact, a better determination of Z\u03b2\u03b3 should include additional\nmixing from higher-lying states, not solely the 2+\u03b2 excitation.\nHowever, because these additional states are well separated\nfrom the 2+\u03b3 excitation, they most likely contribute minimally\nto the measured V\u03b3\u03b2 .\nTo investigate the perturbation, if any, to the energies\nof excited states, we consider a few energy ratios that\nprovide characteristic indicators of structure, given in Table V.\nIncluded are R4\/2 \u2261 E(4+1 )\/E(2+1 ) for the ground-state band\nand the first excited 0+ band as well as the R2 \u2261\n[E(2+\u03b2 )-E(0+2 )]\/E(2+1 ) ratio. With increasing neutron number,\nthe ground-state R4\/2 values for the Hf isotopes given in\nTable V increase and approach the rigid rotor limit of 3.33.\n054304-13\nE. A. MCCUTCHAN et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 77, 054304 (2008)\nTABLE V. Energy ratios in the Hf isotopes.\nIncluded are the R4\/2 in the ground-state band (g.s.)\nand the excited 0+ band (0+2 ) as well as the R2 \u2261\n[E(2+\u03b2 ) \u2212 E(0+2 )]\/E(2+1 ) ratio.\nR4\/2 (g.s.)

The ratio of\nthe relative 2+ to 0+ spacing in the excited 0+2 band and\nthe ground-state band, R2, decreases with increasing neutron\nnumber, with the exception of 170Hf.\nThe gradual evolution of most energies in Table V sug-\ngests that although there is a large matrix element between\nthe 2+\u03b2 and 2+\u03b3 excitations, it does not significantly per-\nturb the energies. Knowing the final perturbed spacing and\nnow the mixing matrix element, we can quantitatively calculate\nthe original unperturbed spacing. Applying a simple two-level\nmixing analysis, we find that a 35-keV matrix element for\n174Hf, for example, gives a \u223c3 keV energy difference between\nthe perturbed and unperturbed 2+\u03b3 and 2\n+\n\u03b2 levels. From the\nenergy ratios given in Table V, it appears that the energies of\n2+\u03b3 and 2\n+\n\u03b2 in 170Hf are significantly more perturbed compared\nto the neighboring isotopes. From the analysis in terms of Z\u03b2\u03b3 ,\nthe mixing between 2+ states in 170Hf is significantly larger.\nAs an approximation, we can assume that the 2+\u03b3 and 2\n+\n\u03b2 levels\nwere degenerate in their unperturbed location. Taking both the\n2+\u03b3 and 2\n+\n\u03b2 levels at 975 keV and recalculating the R4\/2 and\nR2 ratios gives R4\/2(0+2 ) = 2.94 and R2 = 0.94. These values\nnow fit within the systematics observed in Table V. Thus,\nfrom both the observed branching ratios, and the perturbation\nto energies, 170Hf appears to be a nucleus where the 2+\u03b3 and 2\n+\n\u03b2\nlevels are completely mixed.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\nOff-beam \u03b3 -ray spectroscopy was performed on\n170,172,174Hf populated in \u03b2+\/\u0002 decay. New coincidence data\nyielded significantly revised level schemes for 170,172Hf and\nconfirmed the previous level scheme for 174Hf. A simple,\ntwo-band mixing formalism was applied to 168Hf through\n174Hf. The results consistently indicate an absolute mixing\nmatrix element between the 2+\u03b3 and 2\n+\n\u03b2 levels on the order of\u223c30 keV. These values are an order of magnitude larger than\nhas been thought in the past. In the case of 170Hf, the 2+\u03b3 and\n2+\u03b2 level are found to be completely mixed.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nValuable discussions with C. J.
