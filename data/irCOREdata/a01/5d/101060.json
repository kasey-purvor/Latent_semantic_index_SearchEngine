The pho-\ntonic wires are suitable for integration with active one-dimensional\nsilicon photonic bandgap waveguides.

To the best of our knowledge,\nwe provide for the first time, a systematic study of the various\nphysical parameters that can affect the -factor and transmission\nproperties in such waveguides.

INTRODUCTION\nRECENT development of silicon optical waveguidesis moving towards a relatively small scale, typically\nhundreds of nanometres. Single-mode condition for such\nwaveguides is possible without the need to configure the\nwaveguiding structure into a ridge formation; however, the\nquestion arises here, therefore, is the possibility of maintaining\nthe polarization independence property [1]. The use of photonic\nwire, for example, with height of 400 nm and width of 400 nm\nis suitable for integration with photonic crystal structures [2].\nThis inherently reduced the propagation loss of the device due\nManuscript received January 27, 2006; revised May 9, 2006.

The local defect inside the photonic crystal leads to the\nhighly confined optical state. The defect can be in three- (3-D),\ntwo- (2-D), or one-dimensional (1-D) photonic crystals. In order\nto relax fabrication restrictions, the defect in the 1-D photonic\ncrystal is a more attractive way to obtain strong optical con-\nfinement. The mechanism for this 1-D photonic crystal is that\nboth the periodical photonic crystal and the high\u2013low index con-\ntrast contribute to the photonic confinement. One-dimensional\nphotonic crystals based on waveguide have been fabricated in\nSi\u2013SiO [2] and GaAs\u2013Al O compound semiconductor mate-\nrials [3]. An air-bridge structure was proposed to improve both\nthe -factor and transmission performance. Compared with the\n-factor of 200 and transmission of 0.72, the air-bridge struc-\nture can provide a -factor of 320 and transmission of 0.94 [3].\nIn this paper, we investigate a theoretical study of the pho-\ntonic wires, to form a concrete foundation on such a structure\nwhich allows the occurrence of both single-mode and zero bire-\nfringence condition (ZBC) simultaneously using the imaginary\ndistance beam propagation method (IDBPM). We also provide\nan alternative way to the air-bridge within the photonic crystal\nstructure, to prevent the through substrate wave-leakage; fur-\nthermore, the diameter of the inner most air hole is reduced and\nthe cavity length is tuned to obtain an optimized result. An active\nelement is incorporated into the cavity center of the waveguide\nby way of an optical phase modulator.\nII. SILICON-ON-INSULATOR (SOI) PHOTONIC WIRES\nThe effect of polarization on photonic wires is based on modal\nanalysis using (IDBPM) [6], [7], a technique based on full-vec-\ntorial scheme, and has been successfully employed to investi-\ngate the effective index of the fundamental mode in the SOI pho-\ntonic wire structure. It is worth mentioning that the IDBPM is\nnot the same as the common technique of performing a standard\npropagation and waiting for the solution to reach steady state.\nThis technique is to provide the option for successively com-\nputing the eigenmodes from the fundamental to the higher order\nmodes or even the leaky modes, thus ideal for the solution of\nmode solving which is much more robust and efficient than the\nstandard BPM. Under the usual IDBPM assumption, the choice\nof the initial field can help facilitate excitation of the interested\nguided modes and minimize computation time. An initial sym-\nmetric Gaussian field is the most efficient for the computation\n1536-125X\/$20.00 \u00a9 2006 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Thus, such fields can be expanded in\nthe modes of the structure by [7]\n(1)\nThe propagation of the field in the -direction can then be ex-\npressed as\n(2)\nwhere is a constant. By substituting the physical axis by\nin (2), we obtained\n(3)\nHence, the calculated effective index of the fundamental\nmode is essentially a function of expressed by\n(4)\nwhere is the propagation step size, is the effective index\nof the waveguide, is utilized reference index, and is the\neffective index of the th mode the effective index. Hence, (4)\nwill lead to a converged effective index when the modal field\nreaches the steady states.\nThe ZBC simulation was set up using the waveguide struc-\nture as shown in Fig. 1, which is an SOI channel waveguide or\nreferred to as photonic wire. The refractive indexes for silicon\n(Si) and silicon dioxide SiO are set at 1.444 and 3.477, re-\nspectively. Photonic wires with an overall height of 300, 400,\n500, and 600 nm are analyzed at a wavelength of 1.55 m. A\nsimilar assumption is made with regard to this simulation as\ndiscussed by Chan et al. [8]. In the simulation, a transverse\ncomputation window of 2.02 and 2.12 in the and direc-\ntion is utilized. The mesh grid for the , , and direction are\nFig. 2. TE\/TM fundamental mode effective indexes for photonic wire of height\n400 nm.\n0.005, 0.005, and 0.0005, respectively. The inherently high re-\nfractive index contrast in SOI material enables the realization\nof photonic wires without sacrificing the mode confinement and\nsingle-mode operation.\nThe increased polarization dependence in small waveguides\nis derived from the increasingly differing mode shapes of the\ntransverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes.\nAs we follow the approach for our submicron dimension rib\nstructure as discussed in [8] and extend the analysis to the pho-\ntonic wire structure with appropriate simulation technique, we\ncan produce a graphical variation of the TE\/TM fundamental\nmode effective indexes as shown in Fig. 2 using photonic wire\nheight of 400 nm as an example.\nFig. 2 presents the convergence behavior of the calculated\neffective indexes for both TE and TM modes versus various\nwaveguide widths. It can be noted that the effective indexes\nincreasing with width for a fixed waveguide height. The inter-\nsection of both TE and TM mode effective indexes indicated\na possible solution for ZBC for a width of 400 nm and height\nof 400 nm. The ZBC condition is defined as the difference\nbetween the fundamental TE and TM modes. We also produce\na graphical presentation of ZBC conditions for different wave-\nguide height and width of interests. Fig. 3 shows various curves\nof waveguide width against the effective-index difference, each\nfor a different height. By properly selecting the appropriate\nstructure where the curves cross the zero-birefringence axis\nwhen the effective indexes of both polarization modes is the\nsame, indicates a possibility to produce ZBC waveguides which\ncan complement our photonic bandgap structure discussed in\nSection III.\nIII. THEORETICAL MODEL OF 1-D PHOTONIC\nBANDGAP STRUCTURE\nThe material system considered here is based upon SOI plat-\nform due to its low optical loss and well understood material\nproperties (e.g., [9]). The waveguide is based on a 1-D period-\nical air hole similar to [2] and is shown in Fig. 4(a). The cavity\nconsists of a Bragg mirror on both sides of the cavity, where\nis the length of the cavity, is the period of the air holes, is\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

The air holes\nare etched into the SiO substrate, which is different from [2]\nand [3]. This etch-down design has been adopted to improve the\ntransmission property in photonic crystal slab [10]. The center\nof this waveguide contains a defect cavity and the active p-i-n\ndiode, shown in Fig. 4(b). The active diode offers switching ca-\npability via the free carrier injection effect (described in the op-\ntical model below). The device structure of the phase modulator\nis shown in Fig. 4(b). It is a lateral optical phase modulator in-\ntegrated into a low loss SOI strip waveguide. The device is a\ntwo-terminal p-i-n structure where both n and p regions were\nmodeled as highly doped regions with constant doping concen-\ntrations of cm , and are based around an overall silicon\nthickness of 400 nm, strip waveguide with a width of 475 nm.\nA. Optical and Electrical Modes\n1) Optical Model: Fig. 4(a) depicts the device with air holes\netched into the SiO substrate. This \u201cetch-down\u201d effect to the\nsubstrate was found to be similar in function to the air-bridge\ndesign wherein both of them can prevent the wave leaking into\nthe substrate. Furthermore, the etch-down design is simpler\nfrom the fabrication point of view. A 3-D finite-difference\ntime-domain (FDTD) package from CST Microwave Studio1\nwas used to simulate the transmission behavior of the photonic\ncrystal structure. Initial simulation validation was performed\nagainst the results of [2], where we obtained close agreement\nwith respect to the reported experimental data. With the elec-\ntrical model described below, the injected electron and hole\nconcentrations at any point of the p-i-n structure can be pre-\ndicted. Soref and Bennett produced the following expressions\nrelating the refractive index coefficient and absorption\ncoefficient changes in silicon [11] due to the plasma effect,\ni.e., injection or depletion of free carriers in silicon [12] at a\nwavelength of m, which are now widely used\n(5)\n(6)\nwhere is the refractive index change due to change in free\nelectron concentrations; is the refractive index change due\nto change in free hole concentrations; cm is the elec-\ntron concentration change; cm is the hole concentra-\ntion change; cm is the absorption coefficient variation\ndue to ; and cm is the absorption coefficient vari-\nation due to .\n2) Electrical Model: The 2-D ATLAS device simulation\npackage from SILVACO2 has been used to predict the dc\nand transient characteristics of the modulator. The simulator\nnumerically predicts internal physics and device characteristics\nof semiconductor devices by solving Poisson\u2019s equation and\nthe charge continuity equations for holes and electrons. The\nsoftware allows a complete statistical approach (Fermi-Dirac\nstatistics) when instances such as heavily doped regions are\nconsidered. Shockley\u2013Reed\u2013Hall (SRH), Auger, and surface\nrecombination models were included to account for car-\nrier recombination. A carrier concentration dependent SRH\nrecombination model was employed, with an estimated car-\nrier lifetime in the intrinsic Si device layer (concentration\nof cm ) of electrons and holes of ns and\nns, respectively. Contact pads were assumed to be\nohmic in nature and hence carry no additional contact resis-\ntance or capacitance. From the dc and transient simulations,\nATLAS calculates the injected free carrier concentrations in the\nintrinsic region of the devices for both dc and transient biasing\n1[Online].

The change in concentration of free carriers is then\nconverted to refractive index change in the device by using (5).\nThis approach has been validated in the past by various authors\n(e.g., [13]\u2013[15]). In order to maximize this change, we must\noptimize the interaction between the injected free carriers and\nthe propagating optical mode. The main parameters used in the\nsimulation are shown in Table I.\nFollowing the work of Png et al. [15], it was determined that\na high degree of uniformity existed in the predicted injected car-\nrier concentration at the injection levels of interest, throughout\nthe central guiding region of the device. This results in a uniform\nrefractive index change across the waveguiding region. After\nobtaining the mean value of the injected carrier concentration\nin the guiding region, we applied the results to (5) and (6) to ob-\ntain the resulting changes in refractive index and absorption for\nthe device under investigation at a wavelength of m.\nAlternatively, the data from the electrical simulation could be\ntransferred to a similar grid-based optical simulator to predict\nabsorption and refractive index changes, but due to the uniform\nnature of the injected charge, there should be negligible differ-\nence between these approaches. The change in refractive index\nresults in a phase shift in the optical mode given approxi-\nmately by\n(7)\nAlternatively, we can rearrange (7) for and determine the\nrequired refractive index change and hence the required carrier\ndensity to achieve the desired amount of phase shift for a certain\ndevice length or vice-versa. Unless otherwise stated, the active\nmodulator length is assumed to be 275 nm.\nB. Results and Discussions\n1) Optical Characteristics: A series of etch-down simula-\ntions were performed. We began by studying the transmission\nproperty for the structure shown in Fig. 4(a), where the air hole\netching depth takes 400 and 550 nm. We found that up to\n400 nm can improve the -factor to around 320, and further\nincreasing will not provide any obvious improvement. The\npower transmission at resonance is almost unchanged when the\netching depth takes 400 and 550 nm. Therefore, in the fol-\nlowing simulations, all the air holes are etched 400 nm deep,\ndirectly down to the substrate. The radius of the inner-most air\nholes takes 60, 70, 80, 90 nm, respectively, while the cavity\nlength takes 275, 285, 295, 305, 315 nm, respectively. Fig. 5\nshows the effect of on both the transmission characteristics\nand the -factor. From Fig. 5, we can see that the -factor de-\ncreases when the cavity length increases. This is because\nthe optical mode is not as well confined in the cavity when\nis bigger. The -factor also reduces when the diameter of the\nFig. 5. Transmission andQ-factor versus diameter of the innermost air hole d\nfor various cavity lengths (a ).\ntwo innermost air holes is reduced. The transmission and\n-factor characteristics share an inverse relationship. Transmis-\nsion characteristics improve when is increased. When is\nreduced, the optical throughput also increases. What is more\nimportant is the fact that a range of device parameters can be\nchosen to obtain high and high transmission properties. For\nexample, when nm and nm, we obtain\nand transmission . Another example\nwould be when nm and nm, we obtain\nand transmission . Table II summarizes\nthese results.\nThe next issue to be addressed is whether the photonic wave-\nguide optical characteristics such as transmission, -factor, and\nresonant wavelength can be varied without an active element.\nFig. 6 shows the relationship between the resonant wavelength\nand for various values of and clearly demonstrates that\nthe optical characteristics can be changed without varying the\nwidth and height of the waveguide. Without requiring stringent\nfabrication restrictions and the absence of an active element to\nachieve tuning, the deployment of such devices is very attrac-\ntive. Furthermore, we note a shift of resonant wavelength when\nchanging the cavity length from Fig. 6. This implies that we can\nobtain an optimized and transmission at a desired resonant\nwavelength with a range of parameters.\nThese flexibilities can aid the study of DNA, RNA, proteins,\nand other biomolecules, where there exists a continual need for\nthe development of environmental, health safety, and clinical\nmicrofabricated biosensors. Such a biosensor requires low cost,\nsmaller sample volumes, massive parallelism, and ultrahigh sen-\nsitivity [16]\u2013[18]. Many biosensing systems depend on binding\nof the analyte to individual label particles such as quantum dots,\ngold particles, and fluorescent dye molecules. These systems are\noften too complex and large or insufficiently sensitive [19]\u2013[21].\nPrevious work on 1-D silicon photonic bandgap waveguides\nhave resulted in -factors at 190 [22] and 265 [2]. These did not\nevaluate the manufacturability of such devices, a fact which we\nrectified above. By having a range of device variations, these de-\nvices may be suitable for bio-photonic applications where high\nresolution spectroscopic interrogation is required.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Resonant wavelength versus the diameter of the innermost air hole d\nfor various cavity lengths (a ).\nThe cavity length as proposed in this work is sufficiently\nlarge to provide adequate surface for biomolecular interaction.\nSuch interaction depends on the bio-complexes which includes\nantibody-antigen interaction [23], [24], enzyme-substrate inter-\naction [25], [26] and lectin-glycoprotein interaction [27], etc. In\nprinciple, these biomolecular interactions will cause a change\nin refractive-index of the cavity region, hence altering the orig-\ninal optical spectrum of the 1-D bandgap microcavity in terms\nof resonating wavelength and\/or power reduction. Therefore, if\nspectral comparison is made between a device with and without\na biomolecular sample, an obvious difference will occur. Such\nmechanisms could be featured into \u201cgo\/no-go\u201d biosensing in-\nstrumentation for initial investigation.\nThe waveguide device proposed here has a submicrometer\nheight (400 nm). At such levels, high scattering loss is dom-\ninated by the waveguide sidewall roughness and must be ad-\ndressed. Sakai et al. [28] and Lee et al. [29] have studied the\nrelationship between waveguide losses and waveguide dimen-\nsions extensively to enable the design and fabrication of wave-\nguide in SOI with minimal loss, where 0.1-dB\/cm transmission\nloss was demonstrated for a device that is 200 nm in Si height\n[29]. This reaffirms that our proposed device is feasible. The re-\nsults reported here pertain to TE polarization. The drawback of\nusing strip waveguides is that it is almost impossible to achieve\na polarization-independent device where the effective refractive\nFig. 7. Predicted relationship between the change in refractive index and\ndrive current along with the voltage characteristics of the optical diode.\nPon \u0019 80:9 nW.\nindexes of TE and TM polarizations match. For a more detailed\nreview of polarizations in waveguides, see, for example, [30].\n2) Electrical Characteristics:\na) Static performance: From Fig. 7, the change in refrac-\ntive index, and hence phase change, varies nonlinearly with ap-\nplied current (gray line). One factor which contributes to the\nnonlinearity of the change in phase versus current density rela-\ntion is the sublinear dependence of the change in free holes\nwith the change in refractive index, as shown in (5). Also, as the\nmodulator is driven harder, more free carriers are injected into\nthe intrinsic region of the device. This increase in the concen-\ntration of the previously intrinsic region results in an increase\nin the Auger recombination rate (at injected carrier concentra-\ntions much greater than cm the Auger recombination\nbecomes the dominant recombination process, e.g., [13]). This\nresults in a reduced lifetime in this region and hence we have\nto drive the modulator harder to achieve an equivalent refractive\nindex change than at lower drive powers. Of course an increase\nin the recombination rate will result in a faster switching de-\nvice, i.e., reduction in the rise and fall times of the modulator.\nThe associated current\u2013voltage ( \u2013 ) characteristics of the op-\ntical diode (black line) are included. Of special interest is the ON\nstate of cm , which in turn translates\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on May 26, 2009 at 11:21 from IEEE Xplore.

This corresponds\nto a power of 80.9 nW.\nb) Dynamic performance: For the switching speed, a tran-\nsient modeling solution was employed.

The rise time is de-\nfined as the time required for the induced phase shift to change\nfrom 10% to 90% of the maximum value. Likewise, the fall time\nis defined as the time required for the induced phase shift to\nchange from 90% to 10% of the maximum value. For the modu-\nlator shown in Fig. 4(b), the rise and fall times were determined\nto be ns and ns, respectively. Fig. 8\nshows the rise and fall times and it is clear that the rise time is\nthe slower of the two, and hence, the limiting transition. In order\nto illustrate clearly both the rise and fall times, a \u201cbreak\u201d in the\nhorizontal time axis was made so that the rising and falling edge\nof the transient waveform could be highlighted.\nThe dynamic optical absorption introduced by switching the\ndevice (ON state) corresponds to cm .\nUsing (6), this injection of both electrons and holes translates to\nan additional absorption loss of cm (i.e., 18.9 dB\/cm).\nThis would result in a dynamic optical absorption of approxi-\nmately 0.0005 dB if the active device length is 275 nm. It should\nbe noted that the optical attenuation could be improved by op-\ntimizing the position of the anode and cathode dopant contact\nwindows.\nThe modulator device speed reported here is rather modest\nand nowhere near one of the fastest reported recently [31].\nNonetheless, the device switching performance can be im-\nproved without changing its physical dimensions by overdriving\nduring the device rise and fall times [15]. This method was re-\ncently employed by Xu et al. [32] to overdrive a strip-based ring\nresonator waveguide to operate at a data rate of 1.5 Gb\/s. How-\never, this is at the expense of increasing the device complexity.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nStrip-based photonic crystal microcavity devices are studied\nusing the 3-D FDTD method. The air holes are etched down to\nthe substrate to prevent wave leakage. The -factor, resonant\nwavelength, and transmission characteristics are of particular\ninterest.\nWe demonstrated via simulation that high -factor, high\ntransmission characteristics ( 90%), and the ability to tune the\nresonant wavelength can be achieved without modifying the\nwidth and height of the photonic crystal waveguide. This was\nattained by tuning the cavity length and radius of the innermost\nair holes. A range of parameters capable of meeting these\nrequirements was identified, which in turn, relaxes the demands\non fabrication and make these devices more attractive for com-\nmercial deployment in bio-photonic and optical interconnect\napplications.\nImprovement of over 30% in -factor was achieved when\ncompared to results in [2] (354 versus 265). This device can be\nswitched by implementing an optical modulator in the cavity re-\ngion. The characteristics of the optical modulator was analyzed\nusing a 2-D semiconductor simulation package SILVACO to in-\nvestigate the dc and transient behavior of the active region of the\nmodulator. The optical device as predicted utilized only 81 nW\nbetween the ON and OFF state, with a duration of 0.2 ns.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank Dr. S.
