Raymond et al., USGS Open-File Report 2007-xxx,yyy,1-\n4, doi: 10.3133zzzzzz \n \nIntroduction \nThe island of South Georgia represents the emergent \npart of an isolated microcontinental block (fig. 1) that \nexposes the tectonically juxtaposed components of a \nMiddle Jurassic to mid-Cretaceous island-arc and back-\narc-basin system (Macdonald et al., 1987). Palinspastic \nreconstructions correlate the Early Cretaceous back-arc \nbasin deposits of South Georgia with those of the Rocas \nVerdes Marginal Basin (RVMB) in southernmost \nPatagonia along the former southwestern margin of \nGondwana (Dalziel et al., 1975). Following closure and \ndeformation of the RVMB during the main Andean \norogeny, the South Georgia microcontinental block \nbecame tectonically displaced along the North Scotia \nRidge during Cenozoic evolution of the Scotia Sea \n(Diraison et al., 2000; Livermore et al. 2007). \nIn this contribution I present a new kinematic \ninterpretation of the Cooper Bay Dislocation Zone, an \nimportant regional shear zone cutting through southern \nSouth Georgia, that had previously been identified as \npossessing a complex tectonic history (Stone, 1982; \nStorey, 1983). Potential tectonic correlations with \nregional events are discussed.  \nGeology and stratigraphy of South Georgia \nThe south-western tip of South Georgia is \ncharacterised by a complex assemblage of highly \ndeformed, pre-Middle Jurassic paragneisses and \nmetasedimentary rocks that are intruded by extensive \ntholeiitic plutons (Drygalski Fjord Complex), together \nwith the local development of mafic crust (Larsen \nHarbour Complex).  This basement assemblage is \ninterpreted as a Gondwana margin accretionary complex \nthat underwent crustal thinning during Middle to Late \nJurassic times (Storey, 1983; Macdonald et al., 1987, \nMukasa & Dalziel, 1996), and is inferred to underlie \nmuch of the island. \n \nFigure 1. Location of South Georgia Island relative to \nthe Scotia Arc, Antarctic Peninsula and southern \nPatagonia. Inset map of South Georgia showing the \ntrace of the Cooper Bay Dislocation Zone (CBDZ). \nThe majority of the rock exposure on South Georgia \nis formed by two laterally equivalent turbidite \nsequences deposited in an Early Cretaceous back-arc \nbasin: the volcaniclastic Cumberland Bay Fm. derived \nfrom a volcanic island arc, and the more siliciclastic \nSandebugten Fm. that was derived from the Gondwana \nmargin (Dalziel, 1975; Stone, 1980; Thomson et al., \n1982; Tanner, 1987; Macdonald et al., 1987). A third \nmetasedimentary succession, the Cooper Bay \nFormation, is exposed in the southeastern promontory of \nSouth Georgia and is considered to be a facies variant of \nthe Cumberland Bay and Sandebugten formations \n(Stone, 1982). \nCorrelations with the RVMB of southern Patagonia \nsuggest that the Early Cretaceous back-arc basin was \ndeformed and uplifted during the mid-Late Cretaceous \nmain Andean orogeny (e.g. Dalziel et al., 1975; Bruhn \nand Dalziel, 1977; Cunningham, 1995) with the basin \nfill deposits becoming juxtaposed against the basement \ncomplexes along a major tectonic boundary, referred to \nas the Cooper Bay Dislocation Zone (CBDZ) (fig. 1). \nThe CBDZ encompasses an elongate belt of generally \nhighly strained igneous and metasedimentary rocks. \nAlong the southwest flank of the CBDZ, basic plutons \nand metasedimentary rocks of the Drygalski Fjord \nComplex are intruded by foliated sheets of porphyritic \ngranites (Storey, 1983), while the northeast flank is \ncharacterised by highly deformed metasedimentary and \nmetabasic rocks of the Cooper Bay Formation. Previous \ngeological studies conducted in the 1970s revealed that \nthe dislocation zone has a complex tectonic history \ndisplaying both dip-slip and strike-slip mineral \nlineations (Stone, 1982; Storey, 1983), although a major \ncomponent of vertical, north-easterly directed reverse \ndisplacement was proposed to account for the \nstratigraphical juxtaposition (Storey, 1983; Macdonald \net al., 1987). Tanner (1982) noted that the CBDZ \ntruncates major structural boundaries within the \nbasement. \nStructure and kinematics of the Cooper Bay \nDislocation Zone \nThe tectonic contact between the basement and \nmetasedimentary units is not exposed, although its \nlocation was constrained at two localities to within 80-\n90m. Due to the lithological and structural differences \nencountered either side of this steep tectonic contact, the \nnortheastern and southwestern margins of the CBDZ \nwill be described separately. \nNortheast margin \nFrom its tectonic contact with the Drygalski Fjord \nComplex, the Cooper Bay Fm. exhibits between 250-\n700 m wide zone of shear, with pale-green, white and \nblack, banded mylonite, giving way to highly deformed \nschists displaying a pronounced mineral lineation along \nthe foliation plane. The margin of the shear zone was \ndetermined from where typical compositional banding \nwithin the metasedimentary rocks was identifiable. The \nmylonitic foliation and colour variation is defined by \nalternating epidote group- and quartz-rich bands. In \nlower strain rocks, epidote, zoisite and clinozoisite often \nform bands within a schistosity formed by \nactinolite\/tremolite and chlorite. Quartz is generally \npresent as thin, discontinuous mylonitic seams. \nMetabasic units display relict ophitic intergrowths of \naugite and plagioclase, together with epidote group \nminerals and chlorite. \nThe mylonite foliation has a mean orientation of \n125\/72\u00ba SW, and displays a pronounced, strike-parallel \nmineral lineation (fig. 2) that has a mean orientation of \n127\/06\u00ba. Numerous shear bands (C\u2019 planes) and \nasymmetric \u2018S\u2019 folds indicate a sinistral sense of shear. \nThe mylonite foliation is commonly folded by small-\nscale (< 1 metre) folds, that define two fold generations: \nan early fold generation whose axial planes are parallel \nto the mylonite foliation with hinge lines parallel to the \nmain mineral lineation along the foliation, and a second \nset of folds that clearly fold the mylonite foliation.  \n \nFigure 2. Structural data from the NE margin of the \nCooper Bay Dislocation Zone. A) poles to mylonitic \nfoliation, B) mineral lineations on mylonite surface, C) \npoles to sinistral shear bands. \nThe early generation folds are predominantly \nisoclinal or tight, upright to steeply inclined, with sub-\nhorizontal fold axes. In general these early folds are \ndifficult to see due to their small interlimb angle and the \ncommon homogeneity of the mylonite. However, where \nidentified, they are defined by bands of differing colour, \nwhich may represent an early formed mylonite foliation \nsubsequently deformed and folded during progressive \nshear. \nThe younger \u2018F2\u2019 folds are less tightly folded than \nthe early generation folds, ranging from tight to open, \nand are predominantly upright or steeply inclined.  \nHowever, fold axes vary greatly from gently plunging to \nsub vertical. There is a noticeable correlation between \nfold geometry and increasing fold plunge, with \u2018S\u2019-\ngeometry folds completely dominating the steeply \nplunging to vertical fold population, whereas \u2018M\u2019 and \n\u2018Z\u2019 folds are present in the moderate to gently plunging \nfold population. This divergence in fold geometry \ndistribution suggests that folding about moderate to \ngentle fold axes may be a product of buckling and the \ndevelopment of parasitic folds, whereas, the steeply \nplunging to vertical folds are possibly a product of \ndistributed non-coaxial shear, in this case, sinistral \nshear. \nSouthwest margin \nThe southwestern margin of the CBDZ exposes the \nlithologically heterogeneous Drygalski Fjord Complex. \nAt the southeastern end of the CBDZ, extensive coastal \nexposures of gabbro and diorite are heterogeneously \nsheared into CBDZ parallel zones displaying augen-, \nproto- and meso-mylonite textures, typically up to 130m \nwide. In general, the mylonites developed within the \nbasic plutons do not possess a pronounced mineral \nlineation. However, where present the lineation is \npredominantly down dip. \n \nFigure 3. Structural data from southwest margin of the \nCooper Bay Dislocation Zone. A) poles to mylonitic \nfoliation, B) mineral lineation, red \u2013 sinistral, yellow \u2013 \nreverse, green - unknown \n The mountain ridges forming the south-western \nflank of the Quensel to Leward glaciers expose multiple \nsheets of porphyritic granite that intrude the Drygalski \nFjord Complex. The granite sheets vary from a metre to \nseveral metres in thickness and are generally medium \ngrained with porphyritic feldspar phenocrysts up to \n15mm in length. Protomylonite textures dominate the \ngranite sheets, with even the lowest strain granites \ndisplaying lozenge shaped quartz and kinked biotite \ncrystals. Rarely, narrow (<1m) zones of meso- to \nultramylonite are encountered. In general, mineral \nlineations are not well developed within the deformed \ngranite sheets, although both dip-slip and strike-slip \nlineations were recorded (fig. 3). Dip-slip lineations \npredominate in the deformed granite sheets, but only \ntwo localities displayed unambiguous kinematic \nevidence, with both shear bands and -porphyroclasts \nindicating a reverse sense of shear. \nEvidence for sinistral strike-slip shear was found at \nseveral localities along the southwest margin of the \nCBDZ.  Typically, thin bands of metabasic schists, \nformerly dykes, display well-developed sinistral S\/C \nfabrics. In addition to the exploitation of zones of \nrheological contrast or weakness, several thin (<20cm \nwide) mylonite zones displaying a sinistral sigmoidal \nfabric were encountered cutting a porphyritic granite \nexposed in an unnamed peak at the northeast end of the \nLeward Glacier.  The preservation of strike-slip shear \nstrains along zones of rheological weakness within a \ndomain otherwise dominated by widespread dip-slip \nshear suggests that sinistral shear post-dated reverse \nshear along the CBDZ. \nBrittle structures \nThirty-one brittle faults where encountered, all \npossessing narrow damage zones characterised by fault \nbreccia and protocataclasite, and where discernible \nfault, offsets varied between 3cm and 12m. 83% of the \nfault planes strike about a NW-SE trend sub-parallel to \nthe Cooper Bay Dislocation Zone (Fig. 4), and where \nshear sense was determined on 16 faults all were \nsinistral.  A subordinate set of ENE-WSW trending, \nstrike-slip faults are also present, which based on two of \nthe faults appear to have a sinistral sense of \ndisplacement. \n \nFigure 4. Rose diagram of \nmesoscale fault plane \ntrends located within the \nCooper Bay Dislocation \nZone. \nDashed red line \u2013 mean \ntrend of CBDZ.  \nThe brittle fault population is widely distributed \nacross the extent of the CBDZ in areas displaying \nevidence for sinistral ductile shear (northeast margin) as \nwell as superimposed on the predominantly down-dip \nkinematics of the southwestern margin.  The dominance \nof sinistral brittle structures throughout the CBDZ \nsuggests that sinistral displacement along the dislocation \nzone was contemporaneous with the uplift of the South \nGeorgia microcontinental block from biotite grade of \nthe greenschist facies (Storey, 1983) into the brittle \ndeformation regime. \nCorrelation of sinistral shear with regional \ntectonic evolution  \nAlthough a detailed structural analysis of the Cooper \nBay Dislocation Zone has identified both the kinematics \nand relative chronology of shear events, the current \nabsence of radiometric age control on these kinematic \nevents means the regional tectonic implications for \nSouth Georgia remains speculative and relies on \ncomparison with tectonic history of the Fuegian Andes, \nthe E-W trending sector of the Patagonian orocline.  \nSinistral strike-slip deformation has played an \nimportant role in the tectonic evolution of the E-W \ntrending Fuegian Andes from the Late Cretaceous to \nRecent. At a regional scale, comparison of structural \ntrends within the external arc of the Fuegian Andes and \nSouth Georgia reveals that sinistral strike-slip faults and \nshear zones truncate the main structural trend lines \n(Chiglione and Cristallini, 2007; Tanner, 1982).  Some \nof these structural trends were established during the \nmid-Late Cretaceous main Andean Orogeny, which \nresulted in the closure and inversion of the RVMB.  In \nthe Cordillera Darwin (Fuegian Andes), main Andean \ndeformation was characterised by sinistral \ntranspressional deformation with the strike-slip \ncomponent being partitioned along the Beagle Channel \n(Cunningham, 1995). \nSinistral transpressional deformation is inferred to \nhave continued into the early Paleogene (Cunningham, \n1993), with sinistral wrenching recognised from Early-\nLate Eocene (Chiglione and Ramos, 2005; Chiglione \nand Cristallini, 2007; Olivero and Martinioni, 2001), \nbecoming transtensional from the Early to mid-\nOligocene (Klepeis and Austin, 1997; Cunningham, \n1993). Present day earthquake focal mechanisms are \nstrike-slip (Forsyth, 1975). \nThe sinistral shear event along the CBDZ appears to \nhave coincided with peak metamorphism in South \nGeoria (lower greenschist facies) and continued during \nuplift into the brittle deformation regime.  These basic \nobservations appear to correlate with the main Andean \norogenic deformation recorded within Cordillera \nDarwin (Cunningham, 1995), although it remains to be \nestablished how the sinistral event along the CBDZ \nrelates to the wider structural history of South Georgia, \nin particular, if it is related to a transpressional, wrench \nor transtensional event. Although a main Andean \norogenic event is favoured, the prolonged history of \nsinistral deformation within the evolving Fuegian Andes \nregion cannot preclude a younger Cenozoic age.  \nSummary \nNew structural and kinematic data from the CBDZ \nof South Georgia reveal that sinistral shear post-dated \nreverse shear along this regionally significant tectonic \nboundary.  Similarities between large-scale structural \nrelationships and the style of deformation between \nSouth Georgia and the Fuegian Andes, in particular the \nCordillera Darwin, suggest sinistral displacement along \nthe CBDZ may correlate with main Andean sinistral \ntranspressional deformation (Cunningham, 1995), \nalthough further structural and geochronological studies \nare required to confirm this  \n \nReferences \nChiglione, A.C., and Cristallini, E.O., (2007), Have the southernmost \nAndes been curved since Late Cretaceous time?
