Introduction \nThe English Fenland covers areas of Lincolnshire, Cambridgeshire, north Norfolk and parts \nof Suffolk and is the largest area of Holocene deposits (some 4 000 km2) in Britain.  Fenland \nsedimentary deposits are up to 30 m (typically to 20 m) thick and they show evidence of a \ncomplex palaeoenvironmental history. Part of this story includes the development of drainage \nsystems, the remarkable preserved remains of which are known as roddons. These are visible \nin the landscape as subtle ridges, up to 1 m high (e.g. Whittlesey [National Grid Reference: \nTL 270973] to Ramsey St. Mary [TL 256880]), Cambridgeshire, (Hayes and Lane, 1992; \nHall, 1992, 1997; Zalasiewicz, 1996; Silvester, 1998). Their origin and infill remain \nenigmatic. However, developments in remote sensing techniques, coupled with new \nsedimentological and micropalaeontological analyses, reported here, allow improved insights \ninto their nature and their relationship with the fine-grained deposits into which the channel \nsystems are incised.  \nThree generations (separate networks) of roddons have been identified (Horton, \n1989), two of which are recognised in the present study area and the third generation roddons \nare found in an area around the Wash (Fig. 1). Roddons are effectively part of and testament \nto a vanished, natural landscape, now obliterated by human activities harnessing the land for \n3 \n \nagriculture, domestic and commercial needs. Despite this, they represent an important \nrepository of information regarding late Holocene environmental change and may be used to \nhelp predict future environmental change in the Fenland as global sea-level rises. Here we \nplace the roddons in a stratigraphical, geological and palaeoenvironmental context and \ndiscuss their architecture, infill and evolution in terms of palaeoenvironmental change during \nthe evolution of the Fenland Basin in the Holocene.   \n \n2. Methodology  \n2.1 Sediment sampling \nThe roddon silts and host clays were hand-augered at six sites within Cambridgeshire to \ndepths between ~2 m and ~6 m depending on the position of the water table and resistant \nmaterial (Fig.1). Cores ~ ca 10 cm long were recovered in each auger head.  Each sample was \ndivided into three for: (1) archiving; (2) particle analysis [Buoyocos Method] for grain size \nanalysis and distribution; and (3) microfossil sampling. \nRoddons were sampled to find patterns of grain size distribution between different \nroddon systems, between different channel orders within a roddon system and between \nrelatively proximal (nearer to coastline) and distal (further inland) part of the system (Fig.2).  \n \n2.2 Remote sensing of Fenland roddons \nRoddon systems were traced using aerial photographs from the University of Cambridge Air \nPhotograph Library, which date from May 1975 at scale 1:13,650 and March 1982 at scale \n1:10,000 and on average have a coverage of ~16 km2 . The 2008 Oxford Terrain mapping \nimages (courtesy of Oxford Archaeology East) have a complete coverage of Cambridgeshire \nand selected areas for Thorney and the Counter Drain area east of \u201cDog in a Doublet\u201d road \nbridge, near Whittlesey, with a coverage of ~50 km2. They complement the aerial \n4 \n \nphotographs in showing surface elevation rather than soil colour, and therefore, pick out \n\u201cburied\u201d roddons \u2013 i.e. those of an early generation that were subsequently overlain by clay. \nHence, they help resolve the different roddon generations when used in tandem with aerial \nphotographs which show the type of surface sediment through tonal contrast. \nThe images from Oxford Archaeology East are derived from 3-dimensional surface \nmodels created using IFSAR digital surface model data at a horizontal posting or resolution \nof 5 m (DSM5) from the NEXTMap Britain dataset produced by InterMap. IFSAR \n(Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) is a radar technique used in geodesy and remote \nsensing which uses two or more synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images to generate maps of \nsurface deformation or digital elevation, using differences in the phase of the waves returning \nto the satellite or aircraft. A nearest neighbour algorithm was applied to the raw DSM data to \ngenerate the 3-dimensional grid which was then enhanced using colour scaling across \nelevation zones. \nData from remote sensing were used in conjunction with British Geological Survey \nfield slips (mapped at 1:10 000 scale) and archived borehole data, East Anglian Archaeology \nReports, local farmers knowledge and field walking to help constrain the field relationships \nand chronology of the roddon drainage patterns.  \n \n3. Geographical Framework \n \nSkertchly (1877) discussed Holocene successions, identified various environments of \ndeposition and attempted to determine palaeoenvironmental processes in terms of salinity \nchange and marine transgression and regression (see also Waller, 1994). Skertchly recognised \na tripartite Lower Peat\/Basal Peat-Buttery Clay- Upper Peat stratigraphy (Fig.3) and the \n5 \n \ndendritic pattern of the sinuous \u201csilthills\u201d of the now-extinct water courses, and his work laid \nthe foundation for all future Fenland stratigraphical studies (Godwin, 1978). \nGodwin (1940) examined anthropogenic influences on the Holocene landscape and, \nusing evidence from pollen analysis, developed a four-part stratigraphic division for the \nSouthern Fenland: Basal or Lower Peat overlain by Fen Clay (Buttery Clay of previous \nauthors), followed by Upper Peat (often the surface sediment) and, in some areas, Upper Silt \n(sometimes called Marine Silt and Romano-British Silt; see Waller, 1994, Fig. 2.3) at the top \nof the succession. The Upper Silt of Godwin (1940) seemingly relates in part to deposits in \nthe fossilised drainage channel systems cut into the peat Fens, and forming the roddons. In \npart, it also relates to regionally distributed silt-rich deposits that form the slightly higher \nground of the \u2018Siltlands\u2019, the Terrington Beds of Gallois (Horton, 1989; Waller, 1994) to \nseaward. \nGodwin interpreted the roddons as lev\u00e9es besides channels that had drained alluvial \nmarshes. This challenged Fowler\u2019s theory (1932, 1933) that the roddon was \u201cdeposited in the \nform of a concave mass within the peat which would subside into a convex form with peat \nshrinkage\u201d (Hall and Coles, 1994; Silvester, 1988). Coles and Hall (1998) continued mapping \nthe Fenland roddon systems although French (1993) noted problems associated with the \nestablished stratigraphical nomenclature and the consistently younger than expected \nradiocarbon ages for the Basal Peat.  \nHorton (1989) identified three stratigraphically discrete generations of roddon in the \nPeterborough district (Fig. 4) related to a stratigraphy represented by clays, which were \nconsidered to represent a marginal saltmarsh environment, interbedded with peats, interpreted \nas formed in freshwater reed swamps (4). The Fen Clay was assigned to the Barroway Drove \nBeds, and divided into two units: the Lower Barroway Drove Beds (the bulk of the deposit), \nand the Upper Barroway Drove Beds, that thins and disappears southwards. These two units \n6 \n \nare separated by a thin peat, and overlain by the Upper Peat (that has now largely \ndisappeared). We employ this stratigraphy, for the sampling executed in the Peterborough \nThorney and Plash Drove areas as assembled in regional mapping, as it forms an effective \nframework for analysing and explaining roddon distribution (see below).  \nThe interplay of sedimentary lithofacies in the Holocene sediments of Fenland partly \nreflects overall global sea-level rise consequent on deglaciation modified by local isostatic \neffects (Shennan, 1986; French and Pryor, 1993; Shennan and Horton, 2002).  \n \n4. The Holocene Fenland landscape \nThe pre-Holocene surface of the Fenland is mostly comprised of Jurassic clays (French, \n1992). Overlying these are Pleistocene tills, sands and gravels (Wyatt, 1954) and the \nheterogeneous sandy clays of the Crowland Beds, of Late Pleistocene or early Holocene age, \non which the Lower (= Basal Peat) lies (Horton, 1989; Brew et al., 2000). More resistant \nchalk underlies the eastern and south-eastern part of the Fenland Basin and limestone occurs \nto the north and west. The palaeo-surface, on which the Holocene deposits rest, is uneven and \nareas of higher altitude formed \u201cislands\u201d such as Ely, March and Thorney. These \u201cislands\u201d \nare in effect inliers of older strata surrounded by Holocene deposits, and are overlain by \nPleistocene gravels and till (Hall, 1996). \nAt the commencement of the Postglacial interval, the Fenland Basin was dry land \nwith a few islands and crossed by river systems. During the Postglacial temperature increase, \nlow-lying wooded areas began to establish themselves with lime as the main tree species, as \ndeduced from pollen spectra (French and Pryor, 1993; French, 2003). Accumulation of \nHolocene deposits began when sea-level approached its present-day position after the release \nof water from the Devensian ice sheets (French and Pryor, 1993). During the period between \n4000-3000 yr BP the marine transgression reached its maximum extent (Brew et al, 2000). \n7 \n \nWith sea-level rise, water tables rose and consequently the Fenland Basin became flooded as \nthe drainage systems ceased to be effective. This allowed for localised eutrophic wood \/reed \npeats to form in the freshwater marsh (French and Pryor, 1993). Horton (1989) dated the \nBasal Peat at 7690 14 C yr BP \u00b1400 (BP calculated at 1950 AD);(8531 cal yr BP \u00b1 447) \n(Fairbanks et al, 2005) at Elmtree Farm (TF 40101487).  \nThe Fenlands were locally drained during Roman and medieval times, but the roddons \nbecame positive features after the phase of 17th century drainage due to the differential \ncompaction of the silts, clays and peats, together with oxidisation and ablation of the peat. \nThus, the modern landscape is dominated by anthropogenic activities associated with \ndrainage and agriculture. \nThe relationship between roddon development and sea-level changes remains unclear.   \nA Holocene sea-level curve for the Southern North Sea (Behre, 2007) shows similarities with \nthe sequences of transgressions and regressions as described by Shennan (1986, Fig. 14; \nWaller, 1994, p.14) and the Horton and Edwards (2005) foraminifera studies in the Norfolk \narea are also consistent with regression at ca 3300 \u2013 3000 yr BP. However, estimates of \nsubsidence, and of the relative sea-level changes derived from the current height of \nstratigraphic contacts are complicated because the silts and sands compact at a slower rate \nthan clays and peats. Currently, constraints on the timing of the roddon infill (mostly derived \nfrom 14C dates of the overlying peats) are insufficiently precise to say whether or not the infill \nevents correlate with the inferred changes in sea level. French and Pryor (1993), Waller, \n(1994) and Hall, (1987) considered that the transgressions were not synchronous across the \nwhole of the Fenland.  \n \n5. Roddon Architecture  \n5.1 Distribution \n8 \n \nRoddons are most clearly seen within an extensive inland belt of Fenland terrain which is \ndominated by fine-grained \u201cFen Clay\u201d (Barroway Drove Beds) facies. The earliest recognised \nroddon generation is incised into the upper surface of the Lower Barroway Drove Beds, and \nthe second roddon generation is incised into the top of the Upper Barroway Drove Beds \n(Fig.3). Both of these (sediment-filled) roddon networks are overlain by peat. A third, later \nroddon generation has been recognised (Horton, 1989) (British Geological Survey, 1984) \n(Fig. 3) associated with a silt-rich layer (the Terrington Beds or \u201cSiltlands\u201d) in the extreme \neast and north-east of the Peterborough district, that stretches seawards to the Wash area. \nThese form the uppermost unit.  Formerly the entire area was covered by an Upper Peat layer, \nnow almost entirely oxidised and depleted following drainage and ploughing, and it is the \nloss of this peat that has revealed the roddons.  \nThe \u201cSilt lands\u201d is topographically slightly higher with silts and fine sands at the \nsurface. That this is not a surface layer overlying Fen Clay, but a laterally equivalent facies, \nhas been indicated by boreholes, which show more or less consistent sands and silts to the \nbase of the Holocene succession (Fig. 5; cf. Wheeler and Waller, 1995, Fig. 5). The roddons \ntraversing this area are harder to see, as the differences in soil-type and elevation are slight, \nbut recent LiDAR images locally reveal them. \n \n5.2 Channel morphology \nRoddons vary in channel width from ca 2 m to >1 km and in depth from ca 1m to >10 m. \nChannels may be placed in a hierarchy comparable to those established for fluvial networks   \n(Morisawa, 1968; Bridge, 2003). The largest roddons \u2013 trunk roddons herein \u2013 are 250 to \n1000m in width, and traverse the entire area. Some may have had a considerable freshwater \ninput and be, therefore, related to the Fenland palaeo-river channels. One such example is the \nroddon of the now extinct course of the Little Ouse River near Lakenheath to the old course \n9 \n \nof the River Ouse between Ely and Littleport, Cambridgeshire. This roddon was visible in the \n1980s at Plantation Farm (TL 642848) and its course can be traced from Old Decoy Farm  \n(TL 665857) to Old Bank Farm, Littleport (TL579874) where it now forms a topographical \nhigh up to 2.5 m above the surrounding peats for approximately 8 km (Astbury, 1987).  \nTributary roddons of at least two orders branch off from the trunk roddons, and these \nare referred to as \u201cmajor\u201d or \u201cminor\u201d tributary roddons herein (Fig. 6). These typically have \nblind endings inland and hence conform exactly to salt marsh channels, with both water and \nsediment sourced from the sea. Several of the roddons are straight and almost certainly \nartificial. These represent Roman and Medieval canals that appear to join together natural \nroddons, indicating that some roddons were open channels at these times and used for \ntransport and\/or drainage. One example can be seen as a straight raised ridge in fields along \nPlash Drove, near Guyhirn, Cambridgeshire (TF 3883905407). \n  Sections through the roddons are periodically exposed when the Fenland Internal \nDrainage Boards improve and clear drains and dykes. The smaller channels have a neat semi-\ncircular outline exemplified by a roddon cut by the new bypass on the A47 road at Thorney, \nPeterborough, Cambridgeshire (TF 313790442) (7A and B). In nearby fields low ridges are \nvisible after harvest time and sometimes the lighter silts\/sands may be seen (Fig. 7C and D). \nLarger roddons locally show lev\u00e9e features while the sediments within the roddon can reveal \ncontorted and slumped bedding and lamination (Fig. 7E and F).  \n \n5.3 Roddon generations and network architecture \nIn the Peterborough district, the average trends of the two main Barroway Drove Bed roddon \nnetworks (Generations 1 and 2, Fig. 4) are almost orthogonal to each other. The Lower \nBarroway Drove Beds roddons drain dominantly north-eastwards while those in the Upper \nBarroway Drove Beds trend towards the north and northwest, the outfalls entering the Wash \n10 \n \n(Horton, 1989). The Oxford Archaeology East IFSAR image (2008) places the two \ngenerations of roddon at different stratigraphical levels in the Thorney area (See also Hall, \n1987). The direction, generations and size of the roddon channels in the Thorney and \nWrydelands area (Fig. 8) are shown clearly by comparison of IFSAR imagery with aerial \nphotographs. The \u201cburied\u201d roddons of the earlier generation, though covered by up to 1 m of \nclay, nevertheless form subtle ridges visible in the IFSAR images but not in the aerial \nphotographs. The aerial photographs, by contrast, clearly show the pale surface silt of the \nlater roddons that cross-cut those of the earlier \u201cburied\u201d generation (Fig. 8). \n \n5.4 Sedimentary structures  \nNear-horizontal, planar bedding on a cm-scale is locally visible in exposures (largely cleaned \nbanks of drains) through roddon infills, while fine (mm-scale) laminations may locally be \ndiscerned. Trunk roddons locally show contorted lamination, particularly near their margins \nand central sections caused by slumping of water-saturated silts and sands. The trunk roddon \n(Fig. 7E and F) shows a sharp contact with a layer of impersistent peat above the roddon \nsediments and indicates a change from a marine (roddon) to freshwater (peat) environment. \nThis peat layer has been preserved by the newly deposited overlying Nene Wash sediments \nand the artificial leve\u00e9s which have not been subjected to farming and erosion as in other \nFenland areas. \nMany roddons show, in aerial view, a more or less central dark linear structure. This \nappears to be a late-stage infill that is relatively organic-rich and at least locally (Smith, \nunpublished) shows freshwater influence. \n \n5.5 Grain size distribution \n11 \n \nThe sedimentary infill of all the roddons augered to date shows distinct patterns in grain size \ntrend (Fig. 9). The trends may be summarised as follows: 1) the infills of the two generations \nof roddon systems of the Barroway Drove Beds are, overall, very similar in grain size \ndistribution; 2) trunk roddons were relatively sand-rich and carried substantial amounts of \nsands and silts far inland, and no significant landward diminution of grain size has been \nobserved; 3) the grain size of any roddon is generally stratigraphically uniform except for the \ntop metre or so, where a generally fining upwards trend is present. There is greater clay \ncontent in minor tributary roddons; 4) the most common component of the infill overall is \nsilt. \nThe roddons of Generation 1 and 2 are incised into clays of the Barroway Drove Beds \n(Fig. 3). These clays are dark\/grey brown in colour and much finer-grained than the roddon \ninfill deposits, although containing small amounts of silts and sands. They show a general \nfining-up pattern in their surface (sampled) part (Fig. 10), while, seawards, the clays show a \nhigher proportion of silts, perhaps having been affected by the marine transgression that \ndeposited the Terrington Bed silts, although this might equally reflect proximity to the \nlaterally equivalent facies of the \u201cSilt lands\u201d area (Fig 1) that remained silt- and sand-rich \nthroughout the Holocene. Comparing the Fenland Holocene tidal creek (roddon) systems with \na modern tidal system of The Wash (at Stiffkey, north Norfolk (TF 9727144158) shows \nconsiderable differences. The modern creeks display similar dendritic channel patterns, but \nthey also show migrating channels, slumping bank sides, salt pan areas, ox-bow lakes and \npoint bars - characteristics reminiscent of a typical fluvial system (Fig. 11). The sediments \nbeing deposited in a modern creek on the north Norfolk coast near to The Wash (Fig. 12) are \nconsiderably more sand-rich than are the roddon infills, and are considerably more poorly \nsorted, with a clay component derived from bank sides as they slump and erode, and \ndeposited as drapes over the channel sedimentary structures. \n12 \n \n6. Microfauna \nThe clays, silts and fine sands which accumulated in the Fenland of the Holocene yield rich \nand diverse calcareous microfauna, especially foraminifera and ostracods, which occur \ntogether with fragmentary fossils of echinoderms and bivalves. Preliminary examination \nshows the microfauna include both estuarine and saltmarsh taxa, but assemblages are \ndominated by distinctly marine and brackish-marine forms (Fig. 13). No freshwater taxa have \nbeen recognised. The finer grained, upper metre or so of roddon material is typically devoid \nof fossils, probably because of surface dissolution, while there appear to be fewer \nmicrofossils in the smallest, \u201cminor tributary\u201d roddons. \nThe foraminifera and ostracoda recovered in the roddon sediments typically are in \npristine states of condition, indicating that they have not been reworked. Microfauna are \ndominated by benthonic foraminifera such as species of Lagena, Oolina, Elphidium, \nCibicides and Ammonia, with saltmarsh assemblages being characterised by Jadammina and \nTrochammina. Ostracods are less common, but include shallow marine and brackish species \nof Leptocythere and Hemicytherura.   \n \n7. Controls on roddon evolution \n7.1 Sediment infill \nShennan (in Waller, 1994) discussed three models of deposition that may control the style of \nroddon infill: (i) a static barrier across the Wash (Swinnerton, 1931); (ii) migrating barriers or \nbarrier islands; or (iii) an open coast. He concluded that an open coast was the most likely \nscenario due to: (a) the range of sediments being analogous to an open coast model; (b) that \nno large barriers exist in the Wash today; and that (c) the Holocene Wash embayment, being \nlikely macro-tidal as at present, would be unlikely to generate and preserve substantial \nsedimentary barriers.  \n13 \n \nThe above open marine hypothesis of Shennan is, in general, supported by our \nobservations of the roddon sediment infill. Most importantly, the infill was marine-influenced \nas the sediments have substantial amounts of marine microfauna present. Furthermore, the \nroddons were almost certainly rapidly filled as no evidence has been seen of channel \nmigration during infill. Thus, although the morphology of roddon channels resembles \nmeandering rivers from the air, they show little or no evidence of lateral channel migration \nacross the saltmarsh environment, in the form of laterally stacked point bars. This is one of \nthe striking features of roddon systems and demonstrates their fundamental difference from \nthe typical preserved records of rivers or of salt marsh creeks (Allen, 1964; Zalasiewicz, \n1986). Other channel deposits have been described from Holocene coastal settings, but differ \nin detail, having for instance a generally finer-grained infill (Allen, 2000), or comprising \nstraighter (anastomosing) fluvial networks (e.g. T\u00f6rnqvist, 1993). \nThe roddons show a history of incision and then infill which reflects a changing \nbalance between erosion and scouring of the roddon floor (its channel) and, shortly \nafterwards, landward transport and deposition of silt and fine sand to block the channel. \nIncision must have been in an overall ebb-dominant regime to allow scouring of the channel-\nforms. Subsequent infill must have marked a change to flood-dominance allowing sediment \nto rapidly accumulate. The grain size patterns obtained from the roddons demonstrate \nconsistent and extremely efficient sediment transport mechanisms into these channel systems.  \nLittle or no clay settled in the main channels until the very latest stages of roddon infill.  \nThere was some limited sediment partitioning, though, between major and minor roddons, \nwith finer sediment overall (and a minor clay component) in the latter. \nThere were repetitions of this distinctive pattern of roddon incision and subsequent \ninfill represented in particular by roddon generations 1 and 2 (of the Barroway Drove Bed \nclays). This assemblage of sedimentary features is consistent with Shennan\u2019s conclusion that \n14 \n \nthere was open access to the Holocene sea. We infer, though, that the palaeo-Wash, as today, \npossessed abundant shifting sandbanks that likely provided the sediment source.  \n \n7.2 Marine transgressions  \nBaeteman (2008) outlined two conflicting relative sea-level models for the relative sea-level \nchanges for the southern North Sea during the latter part of the Holocene (the last 2500 years) \n\u2013 (1) fluctuating sea-level models such as Behre (2007) described below and (2) the smooth \nsea-level rise models as inferred by Kiden (1995) for the southwestern Netherlands and \nDenys and Baeteman (1995) for Belgian coastal plains. The latter authors suggest that the \nfacies variations of coastal evolution were not the result of sea- level rise but were caused by \ntidal channels responding to changes in accommodation space, sediment supply and more \nlatterly, human impact. \nHolocene sea-level rise, modelled by Behre (2007), indicates a steep sea-level rise until ca \n6950 yr BP, after which it levelled out, although several oscillations reflect short-lived \ntransgressions and regressions. Several of the oscillations defined by Shennan (1986) are very \nsimilar, particularly that between ca 4500 and 4200 yr BP while Horton and Edwards (2005) \nalso recognised a marked fall in sea-level about 3150 BP after investigating Norfolk \nforaminifera. Three main marine transgressions, all millennial scale, have been inferred for \nthe Fenland (Coles and Hall, 1998; Waller, 1994) and their reconstructed palaeogeographies \nat the time of maximum local sea level are indicated in Figure 14. The distribution of the \nmarine deposits gives the likely limit of the marine influence, Figure 14 (A,B,C). \n \nThe first major marine transgression resulted in the deposition of the Lower Barroway \nDrove Beds clays. This may in part have been diachronous across the Fenland (Hall, 1987; \nFrench, 2003). Dates for this earliest marine incursion range from ca 4200-3300 yr BP \n15 \n \n(Shennan, 1986b; French and Pryor, 1993). The first generation of roddons formed at or near \nthe end of deposition of these Lower Barroway Drove Beds clays. The Thorney area of \nCambridgeshire was subject to a second marine incursion which deposited the Upper \nBarroway Drove Beds, forming the \u2018host\u2019 for the second generation of roddons. These beds \nare dated ca 3000 yr BP with possible continuation of sedimentation at 3300 to 2900 yr BP \nover the Western-central Fens, although the underlying peat markers are missing (Waller, \n1994). \nGiven that the second main generation of roddons in the Barroway Drove Bed clays \ncrosses the first generation roddons almost orthogonally, the prevailing drainage pattern in \nthe Fenland must have altered course and direction, possibly due to a change in morphology \nof the evolving Wash coastline. Breaching would have taken place at different sites as the old \nroddon channels were silted up and would have given no access to the incoming tides. Also, \nthe shifting of vegetation and sediment zones with the changes of marine\/freshwater \nsedimentation likely influenced tidal creek development (Shennan, 1986). The effect of \ncontinued (and presumably differential) subsidence of the Fenland Basin since 6500 yr BP at \na rate of 0.9\/1000 years was likely also an influence on sedimentation patterns. \nThe third generation of roddons (the youngest) developed within the marine silts of \nthe Terrington Beds which occur just north of Thorney \u201cisland\u201d and south of Crowland \n\u201cisland\u201d (Cambridgeshire), but mainly occur in the South Lincolnshire Fens. Shennan dated \nthese deposits at 3000 \u2013 1900 yr BP (Waller, 1994), thus in part overlapping the age of the \nsecond generation roddons. The silts of this third generation differ from the first two \ngenerations in being coarser-grained (Shennan, 1986) and deposited in a higher energy \nenvironment. These roddons however are not easily distinguished separately on aerial \nphotographs.  \n16 \n \nThe coincidence of the silted-up roddons of the first two generations and the \nrespective transition from the Barroway Drove Beds clay to peat is striking. Silting up of the \nroddons, therefore, likely marked the end of an effective saltmarsh drainage system. This \nwould have meant that the supply of water and sediment from seaward, which up until then \nwould have been transported along the tidal creeks, would have been drastically reduced or \neven stopped. Such a \u201cclastic sediment shut-off\u201d from seaward could in itself have initiated \npeat accumulation, especially if a rising water table was occurring landward associated with \nponding of river waters, whose access to the sea would have been equally hindered. If this \nsuggestion has merit, then sea-level fluctuations might have had little direct fine\u2013scale \ncontrol on determining peat\/clay transitions in this region.  This mechanism resembles that \ninferred in part for the Dutch Holocene succession, which relates areas of peat and clay \ndeposition to the changing position of tidal inlets in a barrier-bar system (De Mulder and \nBosch, 1982; see also Kiden, 1995, Denys and Baeteman, 1995). This suggested mechanism \nreflects the delicate balance which likely existed in the natural Fenland environment, and its \nsusceptibility to rapid environmental change across large areas, following what may have \nbeen a modest triggering process such as new tidal channels opening or being blocked which \nmay have triggered geomorphological change inland. \n \n7.3 Future evolution \nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (2007) report predicts that sea level \nrise will be of the order of 0.18 \u2013 0.58m by 2100. An additional 0.10 to 0.20 m is possible if \nthe recent melting of polar ice sheets continues (Turner et al, 2009). Since the 17th century \ndrainage and the attendant shrinkage and ablation of the Peat Fen area means that it is now -2 \nm below sea-level (Ordnance Datum) with the silt-dominated areas lying at or just above 0.3 \nm OD (Waller, 1994).   \n17 \n \nOver the coming decades and centuries, therefore, the Fenland is likely to be subjected to \nfuture marine transgressions beyond the norm for the Holocene. Future transgressions will \ntake place over an extensive area which has already been anthropogenically modified. The \nsubsidence caused by the drainage (compaction) and peat wastage (removal of surface \nsediment) is effectively irreversible. It is clear that roddons cannot be re-used as channels in \nfuture transgression events, but will concentrate water flow between them. The future \ngeological record of the Fenland will thus, once more, be governed by these remarkable, \ngeomorphological features. \n \n8. Conclusions \nRoddons in the English Fenlands are fossilized tidal creek systems of mid to late Holocene \nage (6000 to 2000 yr BP), incised into contemporaneous clay deposits. Sedimentation in \nmajor \u201ctrunk\u201d roddons was predominantly of fine sands, while tributaries are silt-rich with a \nsubordinate clay component. Sedimentation within the tidal creeks was dominated by the \ninfluence of marine conditions as indicated by the common shallow marine and brackish \nmarine foraminifera and ostracods, although in some areas a salt-marsh community was \nestablished. The architecture of roddon generations and the pattern of their infill appear to \nhave been affected by changes in the palaeogeography of the Wash and perhaps oscillations \nin local sea level. The roddons differ from modern tidal creeks in the Wash area: although \nthey show well-developed dendritic meandering patterns, there is little or no evidence of \nsand\/silt infill during active meandering; thus, unlike modern tidal creeks\/rivers they typically \nlack laterally stacked point bar deposits and this suggests rapid infill. Choking of active \ndrainage networks by sediment may have resulted in mudflat\/saltmarsh environments being \nconverted into widespread peat-forming, freshwater reed swamps as the fen deposits \naccumulated. The silt and sand infill formed a network of ridges (roddons) after the \n18 \n \nsurrounding landscape underwent preferential subsidence and erosion largely due to \nanthropogenic drainage. This change is irreversible and will determine the pattern of future \nmarine transgressions. \nAcknowledgements.
