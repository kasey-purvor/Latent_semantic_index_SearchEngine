Introduction\nA growing body of political science research looks at how the design of the electoral\nsystem shapes the voting behavior of politicians in parliaments. A common view is\nthat in \u2018closed\u2019 list proportional representation (PR) systems, where citizens can only\nvote for slates of candidates presented by parties, politicians are dependent upon the\n1 This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research\nFoundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (KRF-\n2008-322-B00006). Hae-Won Jun appreciates the NRF for the support.\n153\n154 hae-won jun and simon hix\nperformance of their party as a whole, and so are beholden to their party leaders\nto place them in high enough positions on the list to gain election. In contrast, in\n\u2018open-list\u2019 PR or SMDs, where voters can reward or punish politicians independently\nfrom their parties, politicians have an incentive to cater to the particular interests\nof their constituents and so may sometimes dissent from their parties\u2019 positions in\nparliamentary votes.\nSouth Korea is a good case for investigating these propositions. The Korean\nNational Assembly (KNA) has a mixed-member electoral system, with some members\nelected in SMDs and others elected on closed national party lists. Existing research\non legislative behavior in mixed-member systems tends to confirm the general\nexpectations: that the politicians elected in the SMDs are more likely to vote against\ntheir parliamentary parties than the politicians elected on the party lists. Nevertheless,\nlooking at voting behavior in the KNA, we find the opposite pattern: KNA members\nin SMDs are more loyal than members from party lists. This behavior stems from the\nparticular structure of candidate selection and politicians\u2019 career paths in South Korea.\nSpecifically, after the introduction of a two-ballot system in 2004, Korean parties had\nan incentive to use the national party lists to show-case high profile figures who only\nexpect to be in the KNA for a single term. In contrast, the members elected in the SMDs\nin the parties\u2019 regional heartlands tended to be senior party barons who set the policy\npositions of the parties.\nThese findings consequently suggest that any theory of how electoral systems shape\nindividual parliamentary behavior needs to look beyond the opportunities provided\nby the electoral rules for voters to reward or punish individual politicians (as opposed\nto parties), to the structure of candidate selection inside parties and the related career\npaths of politicians.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review the literature on\nelectoral systems and legislative behavior, focusing on the research on multi-member\nsystems. In Section 3, we discuss the specific characteristics of elections, candidate\nselection, and career paths in South Korea and propose several hypotheses about how\nwe expect these processes to affect legislative behavior in the KNA. In Section 4, we\nintroduce the data and variables, and Section 5 presents the results. Finally, Section 6\ncontains the conclusion.\n2. Electoral systems, career paths, and legislative behavior\nWith the availability of new parliamentary voting data and armed with new\ntheoretical propositions there has been an explosion of new research in political science\nin the last decade on the impact of electoral institutions on legislative behavior. A variety\nof theoretical ideas have been put forward. In particular, John Carey, Matthew Shugart,\nand others argue that politicians elected under \u2018candidate-centric\u2019 electoral rules, such\nas an open-list PR system, are more likely to be independent from their parties than\npoliticians who are elected under \u2018party-centric\u2019 rules, such as closed-list PR system\n(Carey and Shugart, 1995; Samuels, 1999; Shugart, 2005; Mitchell, 2000; Shugart et al.,\nelectoral systems, political career paths and legislative behavior 155\n2005; Carey, 2007, 2008). When testing these propositions in cross-country research,\na common problem is that it is difficult to identify the causal effect of electoral rules\non legislative behavior independently from several other cross-country factors, such as\nhow parties are organized. For example, are electoral rules the cause or the consequence\nof cohesive parties, in that highly institutionalized parties might choose closed-list PR\nsystems, while divided or weak parties choose open-list PR systems?\nSo, one potential way of identifying the effects of electoral rules on legislative\nbehavior is to look at countries with mixed-member systems; where legislators in the\nsame country and in the same party are elected under two different sets of rules \u2013\nusually SMDs and multi-member list PR. For example, Haspel et al. (1998) find that\nparties in the Russian Duma are less cohesive if a high proportion of a their politicians\nare elected in SMDs compared to party lists. Stratmann and Baur (2002) find that\nGerman Bundestag members elected in SMDs tend to join committees that mainly serve\ngeographic interests, whereas members elected on party lists tend to join committees\nthat mainly serve general public interests. Herron (2002) finds that members of the\nUkrainian Rada elected either on PR lists or in safe SMDs are more likely to vote against\ntheir party than members elected in marginal SMDs, while Ferrara (2004) finds similar\nresults for the Italian Chamber of Deputies (cf. Ferrara et al., 2005). And, Pekkanen\net al. (2006) find that Japanese Diet members in vulnerable positions either on the\nparty lists or in marginal SMDs are given high profile legislative posts to increase their\nchances of re-election.\nHowever, even in mixed-member systems the effect of electoral rules on legislative\nbehavior is not uniform. This is because several other factors shape the relationship\nbetween parliamentarians and their parties. For example, political career paths\ninfluence the availability and power of the \u2018carrots\u2019 party leaders have at their disposal\nto enforce party discipline. A standard assumption in theories of parliamentary\ngovernment is that politicians not only seek re-election but also seek promotion to\nministerial office (e.g. Kam,2008). If party leaders are free to decide who gets promotion,\nthey can use the carrot of promotion to encourage potential rebels to toe the party line.\nAs a result, once a politician has finished his or her ministerial career, the promise of\npromotion is less forceful (e.g. Benedetto and Hix, 2007).\nA similar effect exists if a politician is not standing for re-election, in which case\nthey cannot be considered to be re-election seekers. However, final-term politicians\nmight be interested in a political career outside parliament. Hence, even if a politician\nis not seeking re-election or promotion to ministerial office she might be dependent\non her party leadership for a post-parliamentary career, such as election to local or\nregional office or to an upper chamber \u2013 as tends to be the case in the fixed single-term\ncongresses in Costa Rica and Mexico (Carey, 1996), for some parties in the Brazilian\ncongress (Samuels, 2003), and for Members of the European Parliament who seek to\nreturn to national parliaments (Hix, 2004).\nA second factor is how candidates are selected in elections. If a party has a\ncentralized system of selecting candidates \u2013 for example, if the party leadership is\n156 hae-won jun and simon hix\nresponsible for determining the order of candidates on the PR lists or which members\ncan stand in which SMDs \u2013 then the party leaders have a powerful mechanism for\nenforcing legislative discipline. In contrast, if a party has a decentralized system of\nselecting candidates \u2013 for example, if a primary is used to determine the order of\ncandidates on a party list or if local party members are responsible for selecting\ncandidates in districts \u2013 then politicians will be less dependent upon their parliamentary\nparty leaders for their re-selection prospects. For example, Samuels (1999) finds that\nthe way candidates are selected and how campaign finances are controlled by parties in\nBrazil have a significant effect on politicians\u2019 behavior. Noury and Mielcova (2005) find\nthat the centralization of candidate selection on the party lists between two electoral\nperiods led to more cohesive parties in the Czech Chamber of Deputies. Also, Thomas\n(2005) finds that across comparable mixed-member systems the centralization of parties\nin Hungary and Ukraine enables these parties to be more cohesive in legislative votes\nthan more weakly institutionalized parties in Russia.\nA third issue is the heterogeneity of politicians\u2019 preferences within parties. The\ndistance between a politician\u2019s policy preferences and the preferences of the party is\nlikely to be correlated with the number of times a politician will want to vote against\nthe party\u2019s position in a legislative vote (esp. Krehbiel, 1993). If a politician agrees his or\nher party leader on every issue on the plenary floor, s\/he will never have a desire to vote\nagainst the party. Hence, if a party is ideologically homogeneous, a party leader will not\nneed to use the threat of de-selection or the promise of promotion to ministerial office\nto enforce party discipline, as the members of the party will naturally vote together.\nFollowing from the former point, parties with more centralized candidate selection\nrules are likely to be more ideologically homogeneous \u2013 and hence more cohesive in\nlegislative votes \u2013 than parliamentary parties with a decentralized system of selecting\ncandidates. But, even in parties with decentralized candidate selection, there could be\nsignificant variance in the preference heterogeneity of their members, as a result of the\npreferences of local selectorates or the socio-economic profile of the members.\nOne way these factors play out in mixed-member systems is through what the\nliterature refers to as \u2018contamination\u2019 between the two electoral tiers (esp. Ferrara\net al., 2005). This notion of contamination initially referred to the complex strategic\nincentives faced by citizens when voting for two different sets of candidates (e.g. Herron\nand Nishikawa, 2001; Ferrara, 2004). However, the existence of two electoral tiers also\ncontaminates the strategic behavior of parties and politicians (Crisp, 2007). First, many\nmixed-member systems allow candidates to stand in both the lower and the upper levels\n\u2013 for example in SMDs and on PR lists. So, if a \u2018dual candidate\u2019 politician is in a safe posi-\ntion on the PR list, the marginality of his\/her position in the SMD is unlikely to influence\nany relationship with the party leader. Conversely, if a \u2018dual candidate\u2019 politician is low\ndown on the PR list, s\/he will be heavily dependent on the party to maintain him\/her\nas a candidate in the SMD and to try to help him\/her win the election in the SMD.\nMoreover, even where dual-candidacy does not exist, politicians in mixed-member\nsystems can seek to be promoted from marginal positions on one level to safe positions\nelectoral systems, political career paths and legislative behavior 157\non the other level \u2013 for example from a marginal SMD to a safe position on a PR list, or\nfrom a low position on a PR list to a safe SMD. Also, a party may decide to nominate\na high-profile candidate in a SMD where the party has no chance of winning the seat\nto encourage its supporters to participate in the election and vote for the party\u2019s slate\nof PR candidates (Cox and Schoppa, 2002; Herron and Nishikawa, 2001). As a result,\nthe strategies parties use when selecting candidates for the two tiers, and the resulting\ncareer trajectory of candidates between the two tiers, will shape how politicians relate\nto their party leaders in both the electoral and the legislative arena.\nIn sum, the effect of electoral rules on legislative behavior is clearer to identify in\na study of a single country with a mixed-member system, where politicians from the\nsame party are elected under different electoral rules, than in cross-country research,\nwhere lots of country-specific factors are likely to be correlated with the electoral\nrules and\/or legislative behavior in a particular country. Most research on legislative\nbehavior in mixed-member systems finds that members elected in SMD seats are less\nlikely to vote against their parties than members elected on PR lists. However, the\neffect of electoral rules in a particular mixed-member system is also shaped by how\nparties select candidates and the career paths and ideological positions of individual\npoliticians.\n3. Elections, parties and political careers in South Korea\nOur research on South Korea is hence similar to existing research on parliamentary\nvoting in Italy, Ukraine, Russia, Germany, Hungary, and other countries with mixed-\nmember systems. In several ways, though, South Korea is a better case than some of\nthese other cases for isolating the effect of electoral rules and candidate incentives\nindependently of parliamentarians\u2019 ideological preferences. First, there is no dual\ncandidacy in Korea \u2013 in other words, candidates must choose whether they stand\nin SMDs or on party lists, which removes one element of cross-tier contamination.\nSecond, and more significantly, from a survey of KNA members, in South Korea\nthere are good quality exogenous measures of legislators\u2019 preferences. These measures\nallow us to identify the ideological heterogeneity within parties and the likely policy\nincentives for legislators to vote against their parties. Without exogenous measures of\nlegislators\u2019 preferences, most research on legislative voting needs to assume that policy\nconflicts between members and parties are either constant or are correlated with other\ninstitutional characteristics, such as the safety of a SMD or the seniority of a member\nin the party.\nWe focus on the seventeenth session of the KNA, which was elected in April 2004,\nbecause this is the first session in which a significant number of votes were taken by\nroll-call. It also happens to be the first KNA session elected under a mixed-member\nsystem with two ballots: one for an SMD and the other for a party list. In the 2004\nelection, 243 seats (81%) were elected in SMDs and 56 seats (19%) were elected in a\nnationwide multi-member constituency by a system of \u2018closed-list\u2019 PR, where voters\ncan only choose between pre-ordered lists of candidates and cannot influence the order\n158 hae-won jun and simon hix\nTable 1.

The make-up of the seventeenth\nKNA is shown in Table 1.\nRegarding the party system, South Korean politics is dominated by a regional\ncleavage (cf. Moon, 2005; Hix and Jun, 2009). For example, in the 2004 KNA elections,\nthe two progressive parties, President Roh\u2019s Uri Party and the Millennium Democratic\nParty (MDP), together won 86% of the votes and 30 of the 31 SMD seats in the south-\nwestern region (Honam), while the main conservative party, the Grand National Party\n(GNP), won 65 of the 73 SMD seats in the south-eastern region (Youngnam).\nAs in other mixed-member systems with two separate votes, politicians elected\nfrom the PR lists have different incentives from those elected in the SMDs. However,\nsome features of candidate selection and career trajectory of politicians are specific to\nKorea. In general, because of the geographic concentration of the votes of the two main\nparties, a position in an SMD is generally more desirable than a position on a party list.\nMorevoer, candidates on the PR lists in Korea can be classified into two groups. One\ngroup is the newcomers to politics, who secure a place on a PR list with the hope of using\nthis to secure nomination to an SMD in a future election. These members are recruited\nby the parties either because of their policy expertise, or because their candidacy will\nlead to support from their professional groups. It is unusual for a party to give these\nnewcomers a second chance to be in the list again, because a position on the list is a\nform of currency for a party to use to broaden its appeal to new voters. So, if these new\nmembers want to be re-elected, they need to build a national profile to make themselves\nattractive for a competitive SMD seat. However, because of a strong incumbency bias\nin the SMDs, as a result of the regional concentration of votes and the related safety of\nmany SMD seats, it is difficult for new candidates to find winnable SMDs.\nelectoral systems, political career paths and legislative behavior 159\nA second group of candidates on the PR lists are high-profile figures who do not\nintend to have a career in the KNA beyond a single term. These can be former ministers\nor close advisors to the party leaders who are recruited from academia, business, or the\nbureaucracy. Parties primarily place these politicians on the PR lists because it raises the\nprofile of the party in a national campaign. Also, many of these policy-makers do not\nhave the time, the desire, or the local party connections to cultivate the necessary local\nsupport to be able to be nominated as a candidate in a SMD. Many of these high-profile\npoliticians are also too old to expect more than one term in the KNA.\nIn the seventeenth KNA, for example, in the two main parties (GNP and Uri), all\nof those elected from the PR list (44 in total) were elected to the KNA for the first time.\nOf all the parties, only five members from the list (out of 190) in the sixteenth KNA\nran for election for the seventeenth KNA, and none of these incumbents was from the\ntwo major parties. Three of these incumbents were party leaders of the minor parties\nand one was the son of former president Kim Dae Jung. This was a big change from the\nsixteenth KNA, when 29 members elected from the PR list were elected to the Assembly\nfor more than a second time.\nThis change in the incumbency profile of the sixteenth and seventeenth KNAs was\npartly due to the emergence of a new party: Uri. However, this change was also due to\nthe replacement of a single-ballot with a new two-ballot system. In the previous single-\nballot system, the focus of parties and politicians was to place high-profile politicians\nin the single-member seats, which meant that the PR list members were largely elected\n\u2018on the coat tails\u2019 of the SMD members. However, the introduction of the two-ballot\nsystem in 2004 introduced a new incentive for parties: to place high-profile figures on\nthe PR lists to attract voters to support their national lists even if they were not voting\nfor the party in the SMD.\nTurning to the career trajectory of members elected in the SMDs, there are two\ntypes of constituencies in terms of electoral success. First, there are the safe seats, in\nwhich a particular party has stable popularity. These seats are mostly in the regional\nheartlands of the parties: in Honam for Uri and Yongnam for GNP. In these districts,\nnomination by the \u2018hometown party\u2019 virtually guarantees electoral victory. As a result,\ncompetition to be selected as a candidate in these seats is severe, and more intensive\nthan the actual election. In such districts, the main opponent for the popular party\u2019s\ncandidate is usually an independent candidate, who often fails to get nominated by that\nparty. The other type of district is one in which no party has a safe seat and regional\nvoting is not expected. Here, party nomination does not guarantee electoral success.\nNormally, the parties re-nominate the incumbents. In the case of the seventeenth KNA,\nthough, there was an unusually high turnover even in the safe seats because the parties\nrecruited new faces in an attempt to refresh their public image.\nBoth the GNP and Uri Party used a combination of centralized and localized\ncandidate selection systems. In 2004, each party set up a special central committee to\nassess potential candidates. In both parties, these committees were composed of equal\nnumbers of internal and external \u2018examiners\u2019. The committee could recommend more\n160 hae-won jun and simon hix\nthan one candidate for an SMD. When the committee recommended one candidate for\na SMD, the party leadership could veto him or her. When the committee recommended\nmore than one candidate, the parties usually conducted a local primary. The primaries\nwere open to non-party members. Still the party leadership could choose not to have\na primary, and the party leaderships could even veto the candidates who won the\nprimaries and impose their preferred ones. In fact, the Uri Party held primaries in\n83 out of the 243 districts it contested (34.2%) and the GNP in 15 out of the 228\ndistricts it contested (6.6%). Hence, although both parties introduced some localized\nelements into their candidate selection system, the centralized systems of selection\nprevailed.2\nTurning to the PR list candidates, only ten KNA members who had been elected on\nthe PR list in the seventeenth KNA were re-elected in the eighteenth KNA election in\n2008. Nine of these members gained re-election in an SMD seat. Interestingly, among\nthese, all four of the female members (three from the GNP and one from the IDP) were\nre-elected in districts in Seoul, and won with margins of between 1.3% and 18.5%. The\nthree male GNP members were re-elected in the party\u2019s \u2018home\u2019 region (Youngnam),\nwinning with margins of between 18.1% and 72.6%.\nSo, given what we know about electoral institutions, candidate selection, and\npolitical careers in South Korea, what should we expect to observe in terms of voting\nin the KNA?\nFirst, as far as the difference between PR and SMD members is concerned, the\ngeneral literature on electoral systems and legislative behavior predicts that politicians\nelected in SMDs are more likely to vote against their parties than politicians elected on\nPR lists, although the research on contamination effects in mixed-member systems\nsuggests that there should be no significant difference between these two sets of\npoliticians.\nHowever, the candidate selection process and the resulting career trajectory of\npoliticians in the two main parties in South Korea go against these expectations.\nBecause PR list members are mainly high-profile figures who only expect a single term,\nand hence do not seek party leadership approval for re-selection and re-election, we can\nexpect these members to be relatively independently minded. In contrast, the members\nelected in SMDs are likely to be party \u2018insiders\u2019, who are chosen by party leaderships for\ntheir loyalty and need to stay loyal to secure re-selection and re-election. As a result, we\nexpect an effect that is counter to the existing literature: that politicians elected on the\nPR lists are more likely to vote against their party leaders than politicians elected in SMDs.\nSecond, the general literature suggests that politicians elected in \u2018safe\u2019 SMDs or\nwho are placed in \u2018safe\u2019 positions on PR lists are more likely to vote against their parties\n2 It is also worth noting that for the election to the eighteenth Assembly in 2008, none of the parties\nconducted primaries. The Uri Party collapsed in 2007 and its members rejoined the MDP which was\nrenamed the Integrated Democratic Party (IDP). Both the IDP and GNP used a centralized candidate\nselection system.\nelectoral systems, political career paths and legislative behavior 161\nin the legislature than politicians in less safe positions. Politicians in low positions on\nPR lists will seek the approval of party leaders in an effort to be placed in a higher\nposition at the next election. Similarly, politicians in marginal SMDs either seek to be\nnominated in safer seats or fear being punished by their voters for rebelling against\nparty positions \u2013 although this effect could work the other way in that a politician in a\nmarginal seat may have an incentive to rebel to appeal to a median voter who disagrees\nwith the position of the incumbent\u2019s party on a particular issue (cf. Benedetto and Hix,\n2007).\nOnce again, given the particularities of career paths and regionalized electoral\npolitics in Korea, we expect the relative \u2018safety\u2019 of politicians to affect PR list members\nand SMD members in different ways. Specifically, the higher the place a member is on\nthe PR list, the more likely the candidate will have a high national profile independent\nfrom his\/her party, and the more likely s\/he will then be relatively independent in his\/her\nvoting in the chamber. This is consistent with the standard notion in the literature about\nthe relationship between seat safety and legislative voting. However, in South Korea,\nthe leaderships of the parties tend to be those members who are elected in the safe\nSMDs in the parties\u2019 regional heartlands, while the new entrants tend to be elected in\nthe competitive districts, which the parties sometimes win and sometimes lose. Since\nthe party leaders determine the legislative positions of the parties, these politicians\nare unlikely to dissent from the majority position of their party in legislative votes.\nAs a result, we expect that seat safety works in different ways for the two sets of KNA\nmembers: where politicians on PR lists will dissent more if they are in safe positions, while\npoliticians in SMDs will dissent less if they are in safe positions.\n4. Data, models, and variables\nWe test these ideas by looking at the voting behavior of the members of the\nseventeenth KNA. There were 574 roll-call votes in the first year of that Assembly.\nAlthough many of these votes were highly lopsided, there were defections from the\nvoting positions of the main parties. We focus on the two main parties: the Uri Party and\nGNP. We exclude the smaller parties as these parties rarely influence policy outcomes\nin the KNA, and treating the votes of the members of these smaller parties against the\nparty majority as \u2018party defection\u2019 is rather dubious since the majority position of these\nparties is difficult to observe in legislative votes.\nTo look at the voting behavior of KNA members vis-a`-vis their parties in the\nseventeenth KNA we estimate the following fixed-effects logistic regression model\nZ = \u03b21PR LISTmv + \u03b22SAFE TYmv + \u03b23IDEOLOGYmv + \u03b24CONSTITUENCYmv\n+\u03b25CONTROL Smv + \u03b26URImv + \u03b27VOTE + \u03b5mv\nm = 1, . . . , 273; v = 1, . . . , 574\n162 hae-won jun and simon hix\nwhere, Ymv is a vote by KNA member m against the majority of his\/her party in vote v,\neach KNA member is indexed by m and each roll-call vote is indexed by v, and\nPr(Ymv = 1) = 1\n1 + e\u2212z\n.\nThe dependent variable is whether a KNA member voted against the majority\nposition of his\/her party, which is coded 1 for a vote against the party majority and 0\notherwise. On average, a member of the two largest parties in the KNA voted against\nhis\/her party 4.4% of the time, in other words 25 times out of 574 roll-call votes. Uri\nmembers voted on average 1.9% of the times against their party, whereas GNP members\nvoted on average 7.4% of the time against their party.\nPR_LIST is a dummy variable, which is coded 1 if a member was elected on a PR\nlist, and 0 if a member was elected in a SMD.\nSAFETY measures the safety of the electoral position of a KNA member. In the\nmodels of the behavior of the SMD members, the SAFETY term is the winning margin\nof a member, measured as the vote share of the winning candidate minus the vote share\nof the second placed candidate. In the models of the behavior of the PR list members,\nthe SAFETY term is the position of the member on the party list, where the top person\non the list is coded as 23 for the Uri members and 21 for the GNP members (since Uri\nhad 23 PR list members, whereas GNP had 21 PR list members elected), the second\nperson on the list is coded as 22 and 20 respectively, the third person is 21 and 19, and\nso on down to the last person to be elected on the list, who is coded 1 for each party.\nIDEOLOGY is a vector of two variables that capture the policy positions of the\nKNA members and the likely policy divergence between the KNA members and their\nparties. First, an ideological self-placement variable is the self-placement of a KNA\nmember on a ten-point \u2018progressive-conservative\u2019 scale, where 0 is the most progressive\nposition and 10 is the most conservative position. These data are taken from a survey\nof the seventeenth KNA members, conducted by the Joong Ang Daily and the Korean\nParty Studies Association (2005). Second, an ideological distance from party variable\nis calculated as the absolute difference between the location of the member on the\nten-point scale and the location of the median member of the party on the same scale.\nThese measures are based on the progressive\u2013conservative dimension in South\nKorea. This is not exactly the same as the classic \u2018left\u2013right\u2019 dimension in western party\nsystems, since the progressive\u2013conservative division in Korea combines economic policy\npositions, security preferences (relating to policies towards North Korea and the United\nStates), and social policy questions (such as rights of women and minorities in Korean\nsociety). Progressives are usually associated with protecting workers\u2019 rights, a dovish\n(\u2018sunshine\u2019) policy towards North Korea, and liberal social policies, while conservatives\nare usually associated with protection of the Chaebol (the industrial conglomerates),\nhawkish policies towards North Korea, and traditional social values. We use several\nsurvey questions to construct a single progressive\u2013conservative scale, which previous\nresearch suggests is a reasonable proxy of the policy preferences of KNA members (Hix\nand Jun, 2009). The 233 out of 299 members responded to the survey (a 78% response\nelectoral systems, political career paths and legislative behavior 163\nrate), and after pairwise deletion of missing responses we can derive a basic ideological\nlocation of 209 KNA members.\nCONSTITUENCY is a vector of three variables, which control for the constituency\ncharacteristics of KNA members elected in SMDs: (1) district population density, which\nis the average number of people per km2 in a district; (2) district agricultural ratio,\nwhich is the ratio of people working in agriculture among the working population in a\ndistrict; and (3) district budgetary independence, which is the proportion of a district\u2019s\ntotal expenditure not covered by central public finances. If the local government cannot\nafford to cover its own expenditure, the central government supports the rest. So, rich\ndistricts tend to have higher district budgetary independence.\nCONTROLS is a vector of four variables which control for potential individual-\nlevel characteristics that might influence how KNA members behave vis-a`-vis their\nparty leaders: (1) times elected, which is the number of times a member has been elected\nto the KNA; (2) age, which is the age in years of each KNA member at the start of the\nseventeenth session; and (3) leadership position, which is a dummy variable indicating\nwhether a KNA member has a key position either in the party or the assembly, such\nas a committee chair, a party whip in the Assembly, and the assembly president or\nvice-president; and (4) female, which is a dummy variable for the gender of a member.\nURI is a dummy variable for the Uri Party, which allows us to see whether the\neffects are different within the two main parties.\nFinally, VOTE is vector of 574 dummy variables indicating each vote. These\nvote-level fixed-effects are included to control for any vote-specific effects that might\ninfluence the defection rate in a vote, such as the policy issue in a vote or the political\nsalience of a particular vote.\nWe first estimate a model of the behavior of all KNA members with and without\nthe ideological variables. We then estimate separate models for members elected on the\nPR lists and members elected in the SMDs as well as separate models for Uri and GNP\nmembers. Descriptive statistics for the variables are contained in the Appendix.\n5. Results and analysis\nThe results from the basic models are reported in Table 2. Here, models 1a and\n3a replicate models 1 and 3, respectively, but only for those KNA members for whom\nwe have ideological self-placement data, so that the results from the models with and\nwithout the ideological variables can be directly compared.\nThe first key result is that members elected on PR lists are more likely to vote against\ntheir legislative party majority than members elected in SMDs. Averaged across the two\nmain parties, and without controlling for ideological heterogeneity, KNA members\nelected on the PR lists are approximately 7% more likely to vote against their party than\nSMD members (6.6% in model 1 and 8.4% in model 1a).3 This result is robust to the\n3 These probabilities are the marginal effects of a one unit change in the independent variable on the\ndependent variable, holding all other independent variables at their mean values. These are calculated\nusing the \u2018mfx\u2019 post-estimation command in Stata 10.\n164 hae-won jun and simon hix\nTable 2.

However, we find\nthat younger KNA members are more likely to defect from their parties than older\nmembers, controlling for leadership position in the party. With longer careers ahead of\nthem, we may expect the younger KNA members to defect less than the older ones, who\nare more established politicians. Also, the younger KNA members are more vulnerable\nto the withdrawal of support by the party leadership. However, the results show the\nopposite. This may be because younger KNA members have less say in shaping the party\npositions, and so are more likely to disagree with positions the party takes in roll-call\nvotes. Interestingly, women KNA members tend to vote against their party more often\nthan men.\nTable 3 shows the results from separate models of the behavior of PR list and SMD\nmembers, controlling for the difference between the two parties (with the inclusion of\nthe Uri variable). As before, models 5a and 7a replicate models 5 and 7, respectively, but\nonly for those KNA members for whom we have ideological placement data.\nThe key result here is that the safer the SMD, the more likely the member will\nvote against his\/her party, while the safer the position on the PR list, the less likely the\nmember will vote against his\/her party. Also, this result is robust to the addition of the\nideological variables. Interestingly, though, the ideological distance between a member\nand his\/her party affects PR list and SMD members differently. For SMD members,\nbut not for the PR list members, ideological divergence between a member and his\/her\nparty increases the propensity to dissent.\nInterestingly, the constituency characteristics of the members elected in the SMDs\nalso make a difference. Members from agricultural districts are more likely to vote\nagainst their parties than other members, while members in richer districts (as measured\nby the district budgetary independence variable) are less likely to vote against their\nparties than other members. As agricultural districts tend to have electorates with\nconcentrated and specific policy interests (e.g. subsidies to farmers and protectionism\nin agricultural trade), the KNA members elected from these districts tend to have a\nbigger electoral incentive to be responsive to the demands from their electorates. Also the\nelectorates in poor districts are more interested in their representatives\u2019 ability to bring\npork-barrel from the central government to financially support local projects as their\nlocal governments are less capable of pursuing these projects alone. With distinctive\nconstituency interests, the members elected from poor and rural districts have more to\ngain to pursue their voters\u2019 interests distinctive from their party\u2019s policy positions.\nFigure 1 illustrates the effect of ideological divergence on the propensity of PR list\nand SMD members based on the results in models 6 and 8 in Table 2.

Conclusion: the interaction of electoral institutions\nand career paths\nElectoral systems clearly shape how elected politicians behave inside parliaments\nvis-a`-vis their voters and their party leaders. However, the relationship between electoral\nsystem design and legislative behavior is probably not as straightforward as some of\nthe existing theoretical ideas suggest. Contrary to the behavior that has been observed\nin some other countries with mixed-member systems, we find in South Korea that the\nmembers of the KNA who were elected on PR lists are more likely to vote against their\nparty leadership than the members elected in SMDs.\nTo understand why this is the case we need to know about how candidate selection\nand career paths work in South Korea. Specifically, the selection of candidates in\nKorea for both party lists and SMDs is highly centralized. However, the main parties\nuse the party lists to attract high profile personalities into politics who are willing\nto stand under the brand label of a party and sit in the KNA for a single term, but\ndo not want to get involved in competing to stand as a candidate in a SMD and\nthen running a district-level electoral campaign, often in a competitive district, or\nexpect a long career in the KNA. In contrast, the members of the two main parties\nwho are elected in SMDs tend to be the senior party barons who run the party\nand so have a role in selecting candidates in the marginal districts and on the party\nlists.\nThe career incentives also mean that the safeness of a member\u2019s position affects PR\nlist and SMDs members differently. Members who are elected in safe SMDs are more\nlikely to vote against the party than members elected in marginal seats, controlling\nfor seniority, which is consistent with standard work on electoral safety and legislative\nbehavior. However, members elected in safe positions on the PR lists are more likely to\nvote against their party than members in less safe positions. This is against a standard\nview, but nevertheless is consistent with the fact that top positions on party lists tend to\nbe reserved for high-profile independent candidates whom the parties try to attract into\npolitics to raise the parties\u2019 profiles in the elections but then are relatively independently\nminded once elected.\nIn short, political science is starting to build up a body of knowledge about how\nelectoral systems shape individual political behavior. In this endeavor, theory and\nempirical research has progressed rapidly in the past decade. However, to understand\nhow electoral institutions affect legislative behavior we need to look beyond district\nmagnitude (such as the PR list or SMD) or the type of ballot structure (such\nas open or closed) to how parties select candidates in different seats and how\npolitical career trajectories shape the relationship between voters, politicians, and party\nleaders.\n170 hae-won jun and simon hix\nAbout the author\nHae-Won Jun is an Assistant Professor at the Institute of Foreign Affairs and\nNational Security in Seoul.
