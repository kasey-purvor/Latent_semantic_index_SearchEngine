This poses challenges to school leaders, raising issues not only \nlinked to student achievement and performance, but also with regard to students\u2019 identity constructions and \ntheir educational engagement. The paper draws on data collected from a small number of teachers and \nMuslim students from two secondary schools in England, looking at how Muslim students experience their \nidentity in the school context and with what implications for their educational engagement. It also discusses \nthe challenges for educational leaders\/teachers in managing Muslimness\u2019 on educational sites. The data \nindicates that the increasing engagement with faith identity can be a response to experiences of \ndiscrimination, marginalisation and negative media. The paper highlights the need for communication and \nunderstanding across differences, underpinned by an equally pressing need for the recognition of religious \nand cultural diversity. \n \nInstitutional demographics have great significance for school leaders and teachers \nbecause these impact on daily practices in schools, as well as on the relevant policy. The \nmanagement contexts of schools in England, particularly in the urban areas have been \nundergoing deep and sensitive changes in the wake of emigration, international mobility \nand globalisation. These emerging multi-ethnic (multi-cultural\/multi-faith!) schools have \npopulation structures which pose challenges to school leaders, demanding wider \nknowledge, understanding and sensitivity. \nThis paper focuses on Muslim learners in English schools, and debates the challenges of \nmanaging Muslimness, particularly in the post 9\/11, 7\/7 scenario. There are 1.6 million \nMuslims in Britain and 33.8% are aged 0-15 years (National Statistics, 2001), who fall \nwithin the compulsory education age. Muslim students in British schools are more than \nhalf a million (Anwar and Bakhsh, 2002, p. 2, 3), and unlike some other faith groups, \nMuslims tend to highlight their religious identity (Brah, 1996; Jacobson, 1998; Modood, \n2005; Shah 2006a), which can be problematic in a proclaimed secular context. In addition \nto that, in the British context, multiple social, economic, strategic, historical and political \nfactors further add to the complexities of interface.  \nThe paper draws on a wide range of international literature to engage with relevant \ndebates. It avails direct data collected from a small study to discuss the perceptions of \nBritish minority ethnic Muslim students and their teachers\/leaders with regard to \nMuslimness, and its implications for schooling. Muslims in Britain have emerged as a \npolitically visible community specifically in the post-Satanic Verses context. The \nMuslim\/non-Muslim divide is traditionally underpinned by numerous factors including \nhistorical and political legacies such as the Muslims in Spain\/Jerusalem, the crusades, the \nWestern Imperialism (Ahmed, 1992). More recently the plight of Muslims in Palestine, \nKashmir and other parts of the world, the role of West (particularly of America) in the \nGulf war, Iran\/Iraq war and Afghan Jihad against Russia, as well as a wider religious \nresurgence, the perceived clash of civilisations, the economic war, the Middle-East oil \nand the struggle for control over international resources have added to the tensions \n(Ahmed, 1992; Esposito, 1999; 2002). In this backdrop, the stand taken by the West over \nthe Satanic Verses issue flared emotions to a higher pitch. The Muslims perceived this as \nan attack against their core belief that no one should be free to insult and malign Muslims \nby disparaging the honour of the Prophet. The protests against Rushdie and burning of \nSatanic Verses fuelled the drive to be recognised and respected as Muslims (Ahmed AS, \n2003; Kepel, 2003). Later international events such as the Al-Qaeda factor, the 9\/11, \ninvasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, and more recently the stand taken by the West on \npublishing of the Prophet\u2019s cartoons and Knighting of Rushdie have further left their \nmarks both on in-group and out-group identity formations of young Muslims, posing \nchallenges to school leaders and teachers. \nThe political, social, economic and educational are not discrete zones. The wider global \ndevelopments influence educational sites, posing new challenges to educational leaders \nand teachers, as well as to the policy makers. The Muslim learners have become the focus \nof policy attention due to political opinions suggesting that pockets of Muslim youth are \nharbouring extreme Islamic views which are partly manifested in their resentment \ntowards the British way of life. Muslims\u2019 insistence on dress code, halal food, and prayer \nspace were some of the early demands (Parker-Jenkins, 1995) sending signals to be \nacknowledged and respected as Muslim. Certain policy responses conceded to these \ndemands in a very limited way, subject to context and resources. However, these \nmeasures are now perceived as insufficient, and complaints of the British education \nsystem\u2019s failure to attend to the needs of Muslims have continued (MCB, 2007). \nThese concerns are exacerbated by the issue of educational achievement of Muslim \nlearners. Studies and surveys have highlighted that Muslim learners, educated through the \nBritish state system are suffering academically, culturally and linguistically as a high \nproportion of Muslim learners are leaving British schools with low grades or no \nqualification (Abbas, 2006; Ahmad, 2002; Archer, 2003; Coles, 2004; DFES, 2004; \nHaque, 2000). Furthermore, they are exposed to the expressions of racism, Islamophobia \nand bullying (Bagguley and Hussain, 2007; Richardson and Wood, 2004; Tyrer and \nAhmad, 2006). Many schools are either not fully aware or not doing enough to combat \nracist attitudes amongst pupils to tackle racism and promote race relations, for either lack \nof resources or other pressures. In this context of discrimination (Parekh, 2000), policy \ndirectives such as equal opportunities agenda, Race Relations (Amendment) Act, \nWidening Participation, Every Child Matters Agenda, or Building Schools for Future \ncannot fully respond to the specific needs of Muslims. An important question here is how \ndo Muslim learners experience their identity in schools and with what implications for \ntheir schooling? Secondly, are there any challenges for school leaders\/teachers in \nmanaging Muslimness particularly with regard to achievement and inclusion? \nThe data on achievement\/underachievement is collected by ethnicity and not by faith \nwhich makes it hard to explore link between achievement and faith identity. However, as \ncertain ethnic groups in Britain such as Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Somalis, and others are \npredominantly of Muslim faith, relevant ethnic data is often availed as reflective of faith \ngroup which has limitations\ni\n. This paper draws on data collected from two state \ncomprehensive schools with explicit reference to faith, to debate the issues raised above. \nThe study was carried out in 2006 as a pilot to generate views and discussions \nunderpinning a proposed research project. \nThe two schools selected for this study represented two large Muslim communities in \nBritain, Pakistanis\/Kashmiris and Bangladeshis (National Statistics, 2001). Many \nresearch studies emphasise underachievement of students from these two communities, \nvoicing concern and apprehension (Abbas, 2004, 2006; Anwar and Bakhsh, 2002; \nModood, 2003), which justified choosing these schools purposively to explore the issues. \nThe participating students were from different year groups, both males and females, and \nwere all Muslims, while teachers were Muslims and non-Muslims, males and females. \nThe sample included twelve students and 5 teachers (3 Muslim and two non-Muslim) in \nschool A, and ten students and six teachers (2 Muslim and 4 non-Muslim) in school B. \nThe focus was to investigate how Muslimness was conceptualised and practised, and with \nwhat implications for the school leaders and for the learners and their schooling. \nThe data was collected through interviewing which was more like focused interaction \nstructured around issues of Muslim identity, how it is experienced (by students) or \nmanaged (by leaders\/teachers), and associated challenges for leaders\/teachers. The \nintention was to provide the participants a flexibility to \u2018pursue a more conversational \nstyle of interview that may see questions answered in an order natural to the flow of \nconversation. \u2026 start with a few defined questions but be ready to pursue any interesting \ntangents that may develop\u2019 (O\u2019Leary, 2005, p.164). The participating students and \nteachers talked about their experiences of Muslimness, and its implications for \ninclusion\/achievement, making suggestions for policy and practice. \nMuslim Students and Identity \nThe drive towards an overarching Muslim identity is international in dimensions \nincluding countries like China (Alles, 2003; Chiang, 2001; Djao, 2004), America (Afridi, \n2001), Britain (Basit, 1997; Jacobson, 1998; Hopkins and Kahani-Hopkins, 2004), France \n(Le Breton 1999; Limage, 2000; Tlem\u00e7ani, 1997), and many others (Haddad, 2002; \nKepel, 1997; 2003; Modood, 2004). The concept of Islamic Ummah\nii\n (community) \nprovides the basis for this super-ordinate identity to an otherwise hugely diversely \ncommunity (Shah, 2006a; see also Lewis, 1994; Mandaville, 2001; Modood, 2004). The \nconcept of Ummah has gained further prominence in the recent times due to diverse \nglobal developments mentioned above, leading to stronger affiliations with faith identity \n(Ahmed AS, 2003; Esposito, 1999; 2002; Hopkins and Kahani-Hopkins, 2004; Kepel, \n1997, 2003). This heightened awareness of religious identity among Muslims is emerging \nas a new \u2018force of resistance\u2019 (Hall, 1992). Modood (2005) explains it as: \na politics of projecting identities in order to challenge racism and existing power \nrelations; of seeking not just toleration for ethnic difference, but also public \nacknowledgement, resources and representation (p.286).  \nProjection of faith identity among Muslim youth signals a challenge to racism and a \nstruggle to establish personal identities. Explorations into Muslim students\u2019 perceptions \nof their identity in educational contexts affirm that their primary descriptor of identity is \n\u2018Muslimness\u2019 (Jacobson, 1998). Admittedly, there is considerable fragmentation within \nMuslim community, however: \nA strong sense of identity that has established roots and finds support in a much \nbroader community \u2026 can be a wonderful resource for combating prejudice, \nstereotyping and maltreatment. (Merry, 2007, p.97) \nGiddens (1993) posits that a self-identity has to be created and more or less continually \nreordered against the backdrop of shifting experiences of day-to-day life. The perceived \ntargeting of Islam and Muslims in recent history has encouraged in-group cohesion at a \npolitical level, driving them towards a concept of Muslimness which appeared to offer a \nsense of security and belonging, in opposition to the feelings of insecurity and otherness. \nThe dynamics involved in the construction of \u2018Muslimness\u2019 are generated by internal \nimages and discourses, and perceived external threats (Brasted, 2005; Shah, 2006a). \nThere is huge literature on identity in sociology, social psychology and feminist theory \n(Bhabha, 1994; Brah, 1996; Giddens, 1993; Hall, 1996), but recognition of religion as a \ncategory of influence for identity construction is not a fully explored phenomenon. The \nrecent religious resurgence invites to engage with identity constructions and projections \nwith higher understanding and sensitivity to work towards societal cohesion and \u2018cultural \ncoherence\u2019 at all levels.  \nMuslimness is one of the hybridic identities, reinforcing the argument that identities are \nmultiple and fluid (Vincent 2003) and keep changing as the nature of political and \neconomic relationships changes between groups, communities and countries. The \ncontending perceptions of Muslimness \u2013 a valued self-definition for the Muslims and a \nperceived threat by the wider society - not only pose a challenge to practices in schools, \nbut also according to Werbner (2000), \u2018British Muslim transnational loyalties have \nchallenged the national polity\u2019 (p. 309). It is highly important in a multiethnic society to \ninvestigate the forces driving towards such identity formations, and their impact on the \nindividuals and the society as a whole (Griffiths and Troyna, 1995). The ways in which \nMuslim students understand and interpret their identity and their experiences of school, \nand how these are interpreted and managed by educational leaders\/teachers are \nsignificant for the debates on achievement, integration and cohesion. Responding to how \ndo they define their identity or see themselves, the participating students and Muslim \nmembers of staff invariably defined themselves as \u2018Muslim first\u2019. Nonetheless, they \ngenerally explicated the response by mentioning their ethnic and\/or British identity, often \nin that order: \nI\u2019m Muslim before anything else. I would say I am a British, I would also say I \nam a Pakistani but it\u2019s less important than Muslim. \nAlthough in each of the case schools the majority of Muslim participants belonged to one \nethnic group (either Bangladeshi or Pakistani), there were some variations. In one school \nthere was one participant originally from Iran and another from Algeria. In the second \nschool three Muslim participants originated respectively from Bosnia, Iraq, and Tunisia. \nThey had different parent languages, belonged to diverse sub-cultures, and dressed \ndifferent. Dress variation was more obvious among Muslim girls whose dresses ranged \nfrom short sleeveless skirt to loose full body dress along with a scarf tied round the head. \nHowever, they all associated themselves primarily with Muslim identity: \nI\u2019m not that religious but I\u2019m Muslim  \nAnother participant argued:  \n\u2018Muslims are one body \u2026 religious element binds us all\u2019.  \nThis seems to be a level where heterogeneity of the faith group is transcended by the \nconcept of Muslim Ummah (Al-Ahsan, 1992). The perceived Muslim\/non-Muslim \nconflict appears to drive them or lure them to identify with Muslimness, as reflected in \nmany responses. One Muslim teacher commented while mentioning Iraq war: \nWe are all Muslims and we are like one body --- one part hurts, we all suffer. \nThen it comes down to a human level.  \nIs this identification with Muslimness in opposition to what is perceived as global anti-\nIslam or anti-Muslim phenomenon? The indications are that identity formation is an \nimmensely sensitive and complex arena, which may lend to political exploitation. Masses \nget caught in the tug of war and are forced to take sides. Kabbani comments in post-\nSatanic-Verses situation: \nWe were caught between two tyrannies: Khomeini\u2019s impossible death sentence \nagainst a writer (fallible or foolish though he may have been) and the harsh \n\"liberal\" fatwa against our religious identity, with its blanket dismissal of us as \nalien, barbaric. Such was the polarisation, that even those who had hardly \nperceived of themselves as \"Muslim\" before, except in family ritual or personal \nreference, were suddenly forced to stand up and be counted as \"warriors\" for \nsubtlety in either side\u2019s position. (2002, p. 1) \nIn the present scenario, the perception among the Muslims, particularly among the youth, \nof being \u2018targeted\u2019 (Ahmed AS, 2003; Ahmed ST, 2003a; Esposito, 2002; Hagopian, \n2004), special registration, police raids\/interrogations, profiling of Muslims, Shooting by \npolice of a Brazilian who looked Asian (BBC, 2005) and \u2018stop and search\u2019 practices \ntargeting particular Muslim groups (MPA, 2004) have left them feeling insecure and even \nparanoid. The Muslim participants in the London school also referred to police raid of \nJune 2, 2006 in Forest Gate (East London), pointing out that although the charges were \ndropped later (BBC, 2006), the effects on race relations and social cohesion might not be \nshort-living: \nAfter the police raid lots of people in East London do hate them. Police wouldn\u2019t \ngo after white people like this if allegations of bomb-making were made. \nWerbner argues that \u2018exclusion, silencing, any act of discrimination is an act of violence\u2019, \nemphasising that \u2018violence begets violence, and violence need not be physical\u2019 (1997, p. \n228). Being imagined and created by media and masses as \u2018potential terror suspects\u2019 \n(Ahmed ST, 2003b, Hagopian, 2004, Hardy, 2005) and being at the receiving end of \n\u2018institutional racism (Macpherson, 1999; Ahmad, 2006) has generated significant \ninsecurity among Muslim students, with uncharted consequences for their learning, \ninclusion and commitment to the wider society. These processes and practices are \ndividing the society and undermining Muslims\u2019 sense of belongingness, driving them in \nsearch of personal identities. Sen (2006) argues that most of the conflicts in the \ncontemporary world arise from individuals' notions of who they are, and which group\/s \nthey belong to in opposition to others. Equally significant are the factors and forces that \ndrive individuals towards these group identities. A study commissioned by CRE (2005) \nfound that:  \nReligion was a dominant source of identification for Muslim participants. It \nwould seem that the emotional significance attached to Islam has grown in \nstrength over the recent past, as issues in the public domain (such as the conflict \nin Afghanistan, the war in Iraq, and the terrorist attacks in New York, Washington \nand London) have been construed as antagonistic relations specifically between \nMuslims and Christians. (p. 38) \nThe enhanced desire among Muslim youth to emphasise their faith identity signifies their \ndissatisfaction with the discrimination and marginalisation experienced as minority ethnic \nMuslims in a politicised anti-Muslim climate. There is no doubt that the religious identity \nis subject to harsh political opposition, but it also provides a power discourse to operate \nin. To a young teen-ager\u2019s self-esteem, an association with a \u2018powerful\u2019 cosmic identity \ncould be more appealing as compared to a targeted BME identity. The need is to analyse \nthe issues and to search for answers. \nExperiencing Muslimness in Schools \nIt is important to explore how students experience \u2018Muslimness\u2019 at a time of potential \npolarisation, and how these experiences contribute to their identity formations and \nschooling. Many studies (Bagguley and Hussain, 2007; Richardson and Wood, 2004, \nTyrer and Ahmad, 2006) highlight religious discrimination and racism experienced by \nMuslim students in educational institutions, with specific references to experiences of \nIslamophobia (Richardson, 2004; Driel, 2004). Literature and archives abounds with \nrecords of racist media constructions of Muslims \u2018in very derogatory and vilifying ways\u2019 \n(Vertovec, 2002). These images and constructions influence Muslims\u2019 participation in all \nfields of mainstream activities including education: \nThere was a newspaper article about racism. It asked a hundred white people \nabout it \u2013 and most hated was Asians, Muslims. That makes me realise I\u2019m \nwalking around now and people are looking at me in a different way. (Parekh, \n2000 quoted in Richardson and Miles, 2003, p. 13) \nHall argues that racism \u2018operates by constructing impassable symbolic boundaries \nbetween racially constructed categories\u2019 (1992, p. 255). The media, in its own interests \nand traditions, plays a strong role in spreading and perpetuating these divides, creating an \natmosphere of mistrust and resentment among the masses (Ahmed, 1992; Ahmed, 2007; \nHall, 1997; Said, 1981). Generalizations from individual examples in the media, or \nelsewhere, to wider populations lead to misunderstandings and misleading assumptions \n(Bhatti, 1999; Shah, 2006a), and impact negatively on the young learners\u2019 engagement \nwho are already burdened by the demands of an intricate balancing act in a \u2018between \ncultures\u2019 context (Anwar, 1998). Across ambiguities and misconceptions, images are \nconstructed by media and masses, which highlight the differences and increase the \ndistances. These images convey messages of rejection and exclusion. As a reaction to \n\u2018media portrayals of Islam as barbaric, irrational, primitive and sexist\u2019 (Osler, 2003), an \nequally strong tendency develops to gravitate towards a concept of identity and Ummah, \nthat are \u2018asserted with pride and are capable of political mobilization\u2019 (Modood, 2005). \nExperiences of exclusion and discrimination play a strong role in smoothing over internal \ndifferentiation leading to struggle for empowerment through a reverse discourse \n(Foucault, 1980), as reflected in the quote from a very young research participant: \nWhen others make fun of you or pass comments \u2013 you know \u2013 it makes you feel \nan outsider. I have been born and brought up here. I have been to Pakistan only \nonce in my life and I don\u2019t fit there. I am walaiti [from West) there. So who do \nyou hang around with? I used to have White friends but now all my friends are \nboys from our community ---Muslims. We share so many things --- and a lot to \ntalk about. \nGlobalisation has fragmented many communities but new communities and association \nare emerging in the new world order. In spite of being target of hatred and ridicule \n(Parekh, 2000a; Richardson and Miles, 2003), Muslimness is becoming more visible in \neducational institutions. For many Muslims hijab\/scarf, beards, or a dress code that can \nvaguely be associated with Islam has led to overt hostility (Coles, 2004, p. 41), but the \nnumber of students wearing these symbols of Muslimness is increasing. The quote from a \nstudent indicates the complexity of reasons for these choices: \nSometimes people make jokes about my scarf. I\u2019ve worn it since joining \nsecondary school --- my own choice encouraged by parents. I decided to wear it --\n- Quran says that scarf should be worn. \u2026 Most of all, it is to please my parents. \nI\u2019m proud to be Muslim. \nWhether these symbolic gestures are Islam or not is not the point. The signals are loud \nand clear \u2013 \u2018we are Muslims\u2019! In spite of difficult experiences, these young people persist \nin projecting their Muslim identity: \nComments are made about \u2018terrorist\u2019, \u2018Bin Laden\u2019 --- made by Whites about \nMuslim children; particularly after July. I\u2019ve not experienced abuse, though I \nknow people who have; almost every Muslim had something taken out on them; a \nfriend with scarf at a bus stop got comments from people driving past; you feel \nyou are being picked on. Didn\u2019t affect my connection with the school but some \npeople did seem to look at me differently. People comment on fundamentalists, \nyou feel they mean you because you are a Muslim.  \nAnother small boy complained that White boys often laughingly call him Bin Laden. \u2018I \ndon\u2019t like it. \u2026 I don\u2019t look like him, and I have no beard!\u2019 he protested. This reminds of \nanother event quoted in Richardson and Wood: \nI\u2019m the only Asian teacher at my school. During the war in Iraq a pupil who\u2019s \nalso Asian told me that she was being teased by other pupils. \u2018We killed hundreds \nof your lot yesterday ... Saddam\u2019s your dad, innit ... we\u2019re getting our revenge for \nwhat you Pakis did to us on 11 September...\u2019 I asked her if she had told her class \nteacher. Yes, she had told her teacher, and her teacher had said: \u2018Never mind, it\u2019s \nnot serious. It\u2019ll soon pass. You\u2019ll have to expect a bit of teasing at a time like \nthis.\u2019 (2004, p. 64) \nWhat can be the educational implications of this bit of \u2018teasing\u2019 or \u2018fun\u2019? Can this \nphenomenon be expected to contribute to a cohesive multi-faith, multi-cultural society? \nPolicies are implemented in a real life context and the real life context does not appear to \nbe very encouraging for accommodating Muslimness. This issue of Muslim identity, and \nits projections and perceptions impact on inclusion and educational engagement of young \nMuslim students in schools. \nMuslimness: implications for inclusion, and engagement \nThe education of diverse groups of students from different cultural, religious and ethnic \nbackgrounds has become an increasingly complex, controversial and problematic \nchallenge across the world (Banks & McGee Banks, 2003; Griffin, 2007, Griffiths et al, \n2003, Meer, 2007, Parker-Jenkins, 2007, Shah, 2006b). An increasing number of schools \nin the United Kingdom (UK) are emerging as multi-ethnic, multi-cultural and multi-faith \n(Shah, 2006a), posing challenges of developing and sustaining inclusive policies that are \nsensitive and responsive to issues of ethnicity and identity (Abbas, 2005; Anwar, 1998, \nBrah, 1996, Feagin et al, 1996, Shah, 2006, Vincent, 2003). Although schools, especially \nin urban areas, are often experienced and successful in providing for diverse needs, there \nare long-standing concerns about the extent to which equal opportunities policy has been \ntranslated into effective practice (Macpherson, 1999). These concerns apply in particular \nto Muslim students. \nHaque and Bell (2001, 366) proclaim that Muslim students in British schools, mostly \ncomprising of poorer communities such as Bangladeshi and Pakistani groups, perform \nbelow average on public tests, and for these reasons constitute a cause for concern. \nSecondly, the apparent alienation of a significant number of second generation Muslims \n(Hardy, 2005) suggests that their sense of inclusion in British society, or lack of it, has \nbecome problematic. Under-achievement and absence of a \u2018sense of belonging\u2019 among \nthe Muslims are both damaging for inclusion and engagement. \nBefore the setting up of the Commission on Integration and Cohesion (Woodward, 2006), \npolicies for managing diversity and inclusion encouraged schools \u2018to offer a range of \nextended services that help pupils engage and achieve,\u2019 (DFES, 2004, pp. 1-2). The \nassumption was that a diverse society should agree on a set of \u2018shared values\u2019 that \ntranscends \u2018deep-seated conflicts between cultures embodying different values\u2019 (Malik, \n2002). The failure of multiculturalism and the search for \u2018practical solutions, based on \nlocal ideas that have potential\u2019 (Singh, 2006) has shifted the focus. Now it is doubly \nimportant to understand the experiences and perspectives of Muslim students and how \nthese may in future contribute to new forms of inclusive education. \nThe initiatives and strategies adopted over the last few decades to achieve inclusion in \neducational institutions (Doyle, 2006) have lacked full cognizance of the ethnic cultures \nand their value systems. This has often resulted in confusion and tensions at the \nimplementation stage, adversely affecting the outcomes of the plans conceived with the \nbest of intentions. The research participants in both schools acknowledged and \nappreciated the efforts by the schools, and school-heads in particular, to ensure inclusion \nand achievement. This included relevant policies, monitoring of processes and practices, \nappropriate use of curriculum, engaging staff from minority ethnic backgrounds, \ninvolving parents and listening to them, developing channels for communication in spite \nof barriers like language\/culture etc, and having \u2018systems in place to fight racism\u2019. These \nschools made positive efforts to celebrate ethnicity. One school was going to celebrate \n\u2018Black Day\u2019 in October and the students were quite excited about it. They seemed \ncomfortable working together but a participating teacher\u2019s comment, \u2018we can\u2019t enforce \nsocial mixing out in the playground\u2019, signals the limitations of the efforts. \nOne major complaint was that the efforts by schools at inclusion and cohesion were \nnegatively affected by media images. The desire to \u2018belong to UK\u2019 is frustrated by \nexperiences of rejection. A participating Muslim teacher who has had his schooling in the \nsame school commented:  \nIt seems harder to be a Muslim. I\u2019m a Muslim, just a Muslim, not anything else. \nDon\u2019t know why media, TV lead me to think I\u2019m Bangladeshi, not English. I feel \nrejected \u2013 generally, everything the way it\u2019s done, media, government, and \npolicies. \nInclusionary approaches need to be positioned within a framework of equality and shared \nvalues. Media hypes and uninformed comments from responsible people can trigger off \nunanticipated reactions. For example, David Blunkett\u2019s (2003) criticism of young British \nMuslims as \u2018feeling part of their faith\u2019, and suggesting to speak English in their homes \n(2004), or Peter Hain\u2019s (2004) implied suggestion that second and third generation \nBritish Muslims are still foreigners if they maintain their religious identity raised \nconcerns about parent culture, language and faith instead of promoting social cohesion. \nThe message seemed to be that integration is \u2018at the price of \u2026 becoming less Muslim\u2019 \n(Smith, 2002, p. 14) which was exclusionary, and negated the policy that \u2018No one should \nbe forced to choose between being British and being Muslim\u2019 (House of Commons, \n2005). A Year 8 participating girl, born and brought up in UK stated: \nI don\u2019t have a sense of belonging to England \u2013 being a Muslim is the most \nimportant identity for me. I feel I belong in Bangladesh \u2013 because I\u2019m a Bengali. I \ndo want to belong to UK and to mix in with others, but -- \nAnd this \u2018but\u2019 is the challenge in working towards inclusion. It points to a gap in mutual \nunderstanding, asking for a change in approach and attitudes. The suggestion is that for \ninclusion policies to be effective there also needs to be a conducive environment. \nManaging Muslimness \nManagement of \u2018Muslim identity\u2019 in educational institutions has become a sensitive issue \nbecause of its implications for educational engagement and inclusion. According to \nMerry (2007), identity formation is a \u2018coherent sense of self within a particular cultural \nmatrix\u2019 (p. 75), in spite of the fact that formulations of identity are fraught with many \ntensions. He argues that \u2018a learning environment culturally (or religiously) consonant \nwith the parents is more likely to produce healthy learning outcomes for young children \nand is more likely to foster a firmer sense of self\u2019 (2007, p.78). Muslim community has \nbeen voicing concerns on diverse forums that the learning environment provided to the \nMuslim children is not \u2018culturally (or religiously) consonant with the parents\u2019.  Instead of \nbrushing their grave concerns under the carpet, it is time to reflect and to engage with \nthem to devise policies and practices for a better future. Educational leaders have a \nresponsibility to create an environment where learners feel valued and respected. \nPlacing value and respect in individuals and groups can be more effective to encourage \ninclusion and engagement, than all the glossy terms and projects. Creating a coherent and \ncohesive environment requires positive approaches and liberal attitudes, promoting \ncriticality and understanding. Educational leaders have a responsibility to put systems and \nprocesses in place that practically discourage marginalisation. Even a term like \nmulticulturalism is increasingly being perceived as a buzzword, reinforcing division and \nmarginalisation. Parekh hints at the dissatisfaction with the associated discourse when he \nhighlights the need to separate dialogical multiculturalism \u2018from segregationist \nmulticulturalism, which leads to ghettoisation, and also from hegemonic \nmulticulturalism, which assigns minorities a fixed space\u2019 (2004).  \nToday\u2019s school context has moved much further from the early 1990s, when measures \nlike language, dress, food, prayer-rooms, etc. were on top priority to facilitate schooling \nfor the Muslim children (Parker-Jenkins, 1995). Needs now extend to demands for \nrecognising faith as a category of difference and for making appropriate provisions \u2013 with \nsignals that if the schools fail to recognise their needs these learners would \u2018go to private \nschools or mosques\u2019 (Smith, 2002, p. 10). The role of mosques and imams in Britain \n(Lewis, 1994) and Muslim faith schools with reference to the education of Muslim youth \nis gaining significance (Cush, 2005; Gardner; Meer, 2007; Merry, 2007). This has led to \nthe emergence of Independent Islamic schools that are managed by religious and \neducational leaders in the local community to address the serious issues of inclusion, \nachievement and learners\u2019 identity. The perceived vacuum left by mainstream education \nhas provided them a space for functioning. And their performance with reference to \nstudents\u2019 achievement at GCSEs level is justifying their existence. The state schools \nappear to be not doing enough to tackle racism, to promote race relations (Parker-Jenkins, \n2005) and to improve achievement as compared to Independent Islamic schools \n(Gardener et al, 2005; Lawson, 2005; Meer, 2007). \nAccording to 2006 National league tables for England and Wales Independent Islamic \nschools, in spite of meagre resources, have excelled as compared to multicultural state \nschools located in the same social and economic areas. Two Independent Islamic schools \nin Birmingham and Hackney achieved 100% A-C grades in five or more GCSEs (Ahmad, \n2002). Many Independent Islamic schools, commonly known as faith schools, seem to \nhave addressed the Muslim learner\u2019s needs for academic achievement in recent times, \nwith seven independent schools becoming state maintained (Special Report, 2006). \nSeveral studies acknowledge that Muslim learners achieve much higher scores in \nIndependent Islamic schools (Lawson, 2005; Meer, 2007). Furthermore, these schools \nseem to prepare students better for integration through developing a confidence in \npersonal identity (Hewer, 2001; Lawson, 2005; Merry, 2007; Parker-Jenkins, 2005).  \nIslamic schools do face the challenges of integrating Muslim learners into the mainstream \nsocial and economic system of British culture by managing the balance between \nrequirements for Muslim learners\u2019 socio-cultural values and state pressures for social \ninclusion and achievement. However, they seem to be doing well in meeting these \nchallenges (Lawson, 2005; Merry, 2007). In this backdrop, underachievement of Muslim \nstudents in the mainstream state schools raises questions regarding the factors that cause \nMuslim underachievement in the state schools. This emphasises the need to investigate \nthe barriers to Muslim students\u2019 achievement, and to explore the areas in which \nmainstream schools are un-successful to provide appropriate support to Muslim learners. \nAn understanding of these issues has profound implications for educational leaders \nworking towards a common agenda for inclusion and achievement in a multicultural state \nsystem with regard to Muslim learners\u2019 identity who may feel marginalised or \nmisunderstood. This requires informed awareness of improved leadership role when \nworking with Muslim learners to understand their cultural values to further support social \ninclusion, achievement and learners\u2019 identity (Merry, 2007). Perhaps working closely \nwith Independent or\/and State Maintained Islamic schools can be another way forward to \nenhance understanding of issues, and knowledge of how to manage these issues.  \nAnother important role of leaders is to prepare teachers to be sensitive to religious and \nreligion-related cultural differences. Many teachers working in the British state system \nare unaware of racist attitudes amongst pupils (Richardson and Wood, 2004). They have \na responsibility not only to deal with racist incidents but also to prepare pupils for life in \na multicultural and multiracial society and to improve their own knowledge and \nunderstanding of the communities of students they are responsible for (Parker-Jenkins, \n2005; Coles, 2004). As majority of Muslims continue to be educated in non-Muslim state \nschools, it is important that the government and the schools make practical decisions to \nensure accommodation of religious needs. An improved understanding of Islam and \nMuslim values among staff, governors, and school community in general can enhance \nmutual accommodation of needs and tolerance. Ameli et al (2005) recommend better \nteacher training on diversity, and a greater balance of perspectives within the curriculum \naiming at generating dialogue through the national curriculum. \nThe educational leaders, including both the policy makers and practitioners, might \ndeprive the future society of its huge potential if they fail to fulfil their responsibilities to \nensure inclusion and engagement of Muslim students or any other group. Lee Jasper, \nsenior advisor to the London Mayor on Race Relations, pointed to this phenomenon \nmany years back, and it invites serious thought even today: \nIslands of exclusion imprison within them boundless talent and creativity, \nconfined by sheer walls of discrimination and lack of opportunity. People will \ninevitably cleave tightly to the central tenets of their culture and faith. \nOccasionally when provoked they will react like a cornered tiger. (2001, Online) \nThe new generation of British-born Muslims, in particular, sees itself as equal partners in \nnational membership \u2013 not marginalised immigrants. Self-identity, as Giddens argues, is \n\u2018the self as reflexively understood by the person in terms of her or his biography (original \nitalics)\u2019 (1993, p. 53). \u2018We are, not what we are, but what we make of ourselves\u2019 \n(Giddens, 1993, p. 75). The issue is no longer to which group these students have been \nborn but the right to equality as British citizens with multiple identities. The resistance to \nthe dominant educational discourse is not a rejection of education \u2013 this would not align \nwith the Islamic philosophy (Shah, 2006b) \u2013 but a challenge to the existing power \nrelations, seeking not just toleration for ethnic difference but \u2018expecting others to respect \nthem and adapt public attitudes and arrangements so that the heritage they represent is \nencouraged rather than contemptuously expected to whither away\u2019 (Modood et al, 1997, \np. 358). It is time to consider the thought provoking question put forward by Esposito: \nCan the majority of Muslims retain both their faith and their identities and do so \nin a manner that enables them to also accept and function within the secular, \npluralistic traditions of Europe and America? (2002, p. viii) \nManaging diversity is a great challenge posed by changing societal demographics. \nBauman (2002) suggests to find new ways to reforge the human diversity into human \nsolidarity. In the case of Muslims, this requires a change in attitudes towards the new \nsociological \u2018other\u2019 \u2013 Muslimness. Literature emphasises that Muslims are not \nwithdrawing but are being driven into Muslimness as an alternate identity because of \nexperiences of alienation and marginalisation in the wider society (Hopkins and Kahani-\nHopkins, 2004; Kepel, 2003; Modood, 2004). Some major complaints from Muslims as \nhighlighted by literature (Richardson, 2004; Parekh, 2000) and confirmed by this study \ninclude lack of respect for their faith, prophet, rituals and way of life, religious \ndiscrimination in all fields of life, experiences of Islamophobia, and hostility from media \nand masses. These experiences affect young students in and outside the schools, as well \nas their families and communities. Within the collective Muslim community, issues from \n\u2018out-group\u2019 are experienced and responded collectively, contributing to \u2018in-group\u2019 \nidentity formations. In spite of huge inner diversity of Muslim Ummah (Shah, 2006b) and \nvast variations in personal levels of adherement to Islamic practices, faith retains a unique \nstatus for Muslims:  \nFor many Muslims, Islam is the key determinant in their lives. Yet schools are not \nalways sensitive to this. Pupils, as they enter through the school portals, are \nrequired to leave their religion at home, not through design but because so often \nthe school as a secular institution, is simply unaware of the centrality of Islam in \nthe life of its Muslim pupils. (Coles, 2004, p. 43) \nIt is only when individuals from all religious, ethnic and other orientations are \nacknowledged as equally valued, \u2018fellow citizens\u2019, that the issue of students\u2019 achievement \ncan be considered in proper perspective. It would be too simplistic to expect \u2018others\u2019 not \nto realise the difference between being manipulated for reasons, or being the focus of \ngenuine care as equal citizens - being a window dressing or valued partners (Rubin, \n2002). An inclusive school should make schooling a positive experience for all the \nstudents. Admittedly, every school context is a unique context, but a wider knowledge \nbase of those responsible for schooling can nevertheless enhance understanding. \nSchool leaders in multiethnic societies certainly need to cultivate commonalities for all \npractical purposes and for social cohesion, but the need is also to be sensitive to ethnic \nand faith difference, developing \u2018a respect for persons as individuals and for the \ncollectivities, to which people have a sense of belonging\u2019 (Modood et al, 1997, p. 359). A \npride and confidence in their heritage contributes to the learners\u2019 enhanced performance, \nand it is the teachers\u2019 and leaders\u2019 task to facilitate that goal by respecting diversity, by \nenhancing the students\u2019 confidence in identity and by strengthening the notion of equality \nin relationships.  \nIn addition to that, getting to know students and communities, and soliciting \ncomprehensive involvement and collaboration is another important factor contributing \ntowards the learners\u2019 educational engagement and achievement. The schools need to aim \nfor \u2018culturally coherent education\u2019 (Michael, 2005) which should encourage and value \nhybrid identities, which may not necessarily be conflictual. An appreciation of students\u2019 \nself-perceptions \u2018may assist minority children in countering the negative stereotypes and \ndiscrimination they face in the larger society\u2019 (Michael, 2005, p. 1). In the case of \nMuslim students, faith emerges as a significant factor in their identity formations, and \ntherefore recognising its role and significance should underpin future policies regarding \neducation and inclusion. \n \n \nReferences \nAbbas, T.

Commonly, \nthis term is used among Muslims to convey the fact that Muslims the world over constitute one Ummah or \ncommunity. \n"}
