For a potential system, it is known as\nthe Kramers problem, in allusion to the famous paper by\nKramers. Until very recently, there remained a gap in the\ntheory of the Kramers problem: How does the escape flux\nevolve from zero, at the initial instant, to the quasistation-\nary stage after quasiequilibrium has been formed within\nthe metastable state? Intuition suggests that the evolution\nshould be monotonic and without any irregularities,\nwhich appears to be confirmed by the rigorous analysis of\nsome partial regimes. However, as we show in the follow-\ning, either the flux itself \u0084multiwell case\u0085 or its derivative\n\u0084single-well case\u0085 may evolve in a markedly nonmono-\ntonic fashion. This nonmonotonicity, like other irregulari-\nties, relates to characteristic changes in the topology of\nthe most probable escape path. In the multiwell case, the\nformation of quasiequilibrium takes an exponentially\nlong time, so that our results are relevant to a major\nportion of the time attainable at small noise intensities. In\nthe single-well case, our results are relevant to much\nshorter time scales \u0084of the order of a period of eigenoscil-\nlation\u0085; interest in such short time scales is of course\ngrowing fast, as modern technologies develop.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nIn his seminal work,1 Kramers considered a weak noise-\ninduced flux from a single metastable classical potential\nwell, i.e., he considered a stochastic system\na!Electronic mail: p.v.e.-mcclintock@lancaster.ac.uk5951054-1500\/2001\/11(3)\/595\/10\/$18.00q\u00a8 1Gq\u02d9 1dU\/dq5 f ~ t !,\n~1!\n^ f ~ t !&50, ^ f ~ t ! f ~ t8!&52GTd~ t2t8!, T!DU ,\nwhich was put initially at the bottom of a metastable poten-\ntial well U(q) with a barrier DU and he then calculated the\nquasistationary probability flux across the barrier. Models of\ntype ~1! are relevant to chemical reactions,1 superconducting\nquantum interference devices ~SQUIDs!,2 and many other\nreal systems3,4 including the recently designed mechanical\nelectrometers.5\nThere have been many developments and generalizations\nof the Kramers problem ~see Refs. 3 and 4 for reviews! but\nboth Kramers and most of those who followed him consid-\nered only the quasistationary flux, i.e., the flux established\nafter the formation of a quasiequilibrium distribution within\nthe well ~up to the barrier!. The quasistationary flux is char-\nacterized by a slow exponential decay in time t, an Arrhenius\ndependence on temperature T, and a relatively weak depen-\ndence on friction G:\nJqs~ t !5aqse2aqst, aqs5Pe2 DU\/T, ~2!\nwhere P depends on G and T in a nonactivated way.\nBut how does the flux evolve from its zero value at\ninitial time to its quasistationary regime ~2! at time scales\nexceeding the time t f for the formation of quasiequilibrium?\nThe answer may obviously depend on initial conditions and a\nrelevant boundary ~i.e., the boundary through which the es-\ncape occurs!. As for the boundary, it can be shown that the\nmost general qualitative features of the flux are valid for any\ntype of boundary ~for the sake of simplicity, we shall con-\nsider in the following only the absorbing wall!. As for the\ninitial conditions, their relevance may vary. The simplest and\u00a9 2001 American Institute of Physics\n596 Chaos, Vol. 11, No. 3, 2001 Soskin et al.often relevant initial state is the bottom of the well, since it is\nthe stable stationary state in the absence of noise: If the noise\n~not necessarily of the thermal origin! is switched on at some\ninstant, then the time evolution of the escape from the bottom\nbecomes relevant. It should be emphasized however that, if\nthe relevant metastable part of the potential is multiwell, then\nthe flux during the major part of the relevant time is not\nsensitive to the initial state provided it is concentrated just in\none well ~e.g., it may be thermalized in the well!. As for the\nsingle-well case, the flux evolution is more sensitive to the\ninitial state and we shall consider various cases. But, first, let\nus discuss the most simple case where the initial state is at\nthe bottom of the potential. We shall refer to it as the bottom\ninitial state.\nIt may seem natural to assume that the flux evolution\nfrom zero to the quasistationary regime is a monotonic func-\ntion without any \u2018\u2018irregularities.\u2019\u2019 Apart from the naive argu-\nment that \u2018\u2018noise smooths everything,\u2019\u2019 this assumption ap-\npears sound because the probability distribution W is\ndistinctly centered at the bottom of the well both initially and\nin the quasistationary stage: W(q ,q\u02d9 ,t50uq05qb ,q\u02d9 050)\n5d(q2qb)d(q\u02d9 ) while W(q ,q\u02d9 ,t@t f uq05qb ,q\u02d9 050) is a\nnarrow peak of width }AT around that same state $q\n5qb ,q\u02d9 50%. Moreover, it was shown recently6 that, both in\nthe underdamped and overdamped limits, the escape flux\nJ(t) does grow at t;t f in a simple manner.\nDespite the above-mentioned arguments, it can be shown\nthat, generically, J evolves from J(0)50 to Jqs(t@t f) in a\nquite complicated way.\n~1! As shown in Sec. II, the flux grows stepwise on time\nscales of the order of a period of eigenoscillation in the bot-\ntom of the well. Apart from filling the \u2018\u2018gap\u2019\u2019 in time scales\nin the Kramers problem ~cf. the big activity in the 1980s\naimed at filling the gap in the friction ranges3,4!, this part of\nour work is motivated by the growing interest in the very\nshort time scales that are now relevant to certain experi-\nments, such as those studying chemical reactions down to\nfemtosecond time scales:7 The period of eigenoscillations\nrelevant to chemical reactions in Ref. 7 is ;1 \u2013 100 fs.\n~2! As shown below in Sec. III, the evolution of the flux\non longer time scales in a multiwell metastable potential is\nalso distinctly different from the relatively simple monotonic\nfunction described in Ref. 6: J grows sharply on a logarith-\nmic time scale to a value which is typically very different\nfrom Jqs(0) ~typically, exponentially larger! and then evolves\nto Jqs(t) during the exponentially long time.\nIt should be emphasized that the qualitative features of\nJ(t) described previously are valid for any reasonable defi-\nnition of the flux, e.g., the full flux through a boundary or\njust the first-passage flux, while the boundary may be a given\ncoordinate, or a boundary of a basin of attraction, or a\nboundary of the vicinity of another attractor, etc.\nTo illustrate our results, we will use the potential\nU~q !5q2q3\/3 ~3!\nfor the single-well case ~Fig. 1!, and\nU~q !50.06~q11.5!22cos~q ! ~4!for the multiwell case @Fig. 6~a!#, with an absorbing wall8 at\nq5qaw in both cases.\nExperimentally, the flux is measured in the following\nway. The system is placed at an initial state, after which it\nfollows the stochastic equation ~1! until either the coordinate\nof the wall, qaw , or the time limit,9 t l , is reached. It is then\nreset to the initial state and everything is repeated. Once the\nstatistics are deemed adequate, we calculate the flux\nJ~ t ![\n1\nN reset\nDN~ t !\nDt\n, ~5!\nwhere N reset is the overall number of resets, and DN(t) is the\nnumber of resets during the interval @ t ,t1Dt#; Dt is chosen\nto be much smaller than a characteristic time over which the\nflux ~5! may change significantly, but large enough to pro-\nvide DN(t)@1 ~roughly, the latter is satisfied provided Dt\n@t l \/N reset).\nThe above-given experimental definition corresponds to\nthe following theoretical definition of the flux:\nJ~ t !5E E dq0 dq\u02d9 0 W in~q0 ,q\u02d9 0!Jq0 ,q\u02d9 0~ t !,\n~6!\nJq0 ,q\u02d9 0~ t !5E0\n\u2018\ndq\u02d9 q\u02d9 W~q5qaw ,q\u02d9 ,tuq0 ,q\u02d9 0!,\nwhere W in(q0 ,q\u02d9 0) is a statistical distribution of the initial\ncoordinate and velocity and W is the conditional probability\ndensity.\nThe theoretical approach which we use is the method of\noptimal fluctuation ~e.g., Refs. 10 and 11! whose details in\napplication to the present problems are given in the follow-\ning. The theoretical results are verified by computer and ana-\nlog electronic simulations. A preliminary report and discus-\nsion of some of the central ideas was given in Refs. 12 and\n13.\nII. SINGLE-WELL METASTABLE POTENTIAL\nIt can be shown directly from the Fokker\u2013Planck equa-\ntion that the formation of quasiequilibrium up to the barrier\nin the single metastable well typically takes14,15 a time of the\norder of\nFIG. 1. The potential U(q)5q2q3\/3. The bottom and the saddle are\nmarked as b and s, respectively.

Ref. 6!. We apply the method of\noptimal fluctuation to this problem for the first time,16\u201320\nobtaining nontrivial new results for short time scales. It is\nconvenient to consider first the case of an initial state with a\ngiven coordinate and velocity:\nW in~q0 ,q\u02d9 0!5d~q02qi!d~q\u02d9 02q\u02d9 i!. ~9!\nThen the flux is sought as\nJ~ t ![Jqi ,q\u02d9 i~ t !5P~ t !expS 2 Smin~ t !T D ~10!\nwhere the activation energy Smin(t) does not depend on T\nwhile the prefactor P(t) depends on T in a nonactivated way.\nAt small T and short t, the factor exp(2Smin \/T) depends on\nt much more strongly than P. So, we concentrate on studying\nSmin(t), which can be shown21 to be a minimum of the func-\ntional:\nSmin~ t ![Smin~qi ,q\u02d9 i ,t !5min@q~t!# ,q\u02d9 ~ t !~S !,\n~11!\nS[Sq\u02d9 ~ t !@q~t!#5E\n0\nt\ndt L ,\nL5~q\u00a8 1Gq\u02d9 1dU\/dq !2\/~4G!, ~12!\nq~0 !5qi , q\u02d9 ~0 !5q\u02d9 i , q~ t !5qaw . ~13!\nThe minimization is done over an escape path @q(t)# at a\ngiven exit velocity q\u02d9 (t), with a further minimization over\nthis velocity ~a minimization similar to the latter was used in\na different context in Ref. 20!. Note that the minimization\nover the exit velocity ~or, more generally, over states on a\nrelevant boundary! was not used in applications of the\nmethod of optimal fluctuation to quasistationary escape\nrates21,22 or related quantities23 since the exit occurred nec-\nessarily through the saddle. The path minimizing S may be\ncalled the most probable escape path ~MPEP!, in analogy\nwith the quasistationary case. The necessary conditions for\nthe minimum of the functional ~11! are as follows.\n~1! A zero variation, dS50: It implies that the MPEP\n@q(t)# satisfies the Euler\u2013Poisson equation24,21\n]L\n]q 2\nd\ndt S ]L]q\u02d9 D 1 d2dt2 S ]L]q\u00a8 D 50, ~14!\nwhich, for the L of the form ~12!, reads\n\u00a8q\u00a8 1q\u00a8 S 2d2Udq2 2G2D 1q\u02d9 2 d3Udq3 1 d2Udq2 dUdq 50. ~15!~2! A zero derivative with respect to the exit velocity,\n]S\/]q\u02d9 (t)50: This condition can be reduced to ]L\/]q\u00a8 (t)\n50, which, for the L of the form ~12!, reads\n@q\u00a8 1Gq\u02d9 1dU\/dq#ut5t50. ~16!\nSolutions of Eq. ~15! satisfying conditions ~13! and ~16!\ncan be found numerically: In addition to q(0) and q\u02d9 (0)\ngiven in ~13!, one can match q\u00a8 (0) and \u02d9q\u00a8 (0) so that the\nresult of the integration ~15! on the interval @0,t# satisfies the\nlast of conditions ~13! and condition ~16!.\nA. Bottom initial state\nLet us first consider the case of the bottom initial state,\ni.e.,\nqi5qb , q\u02d9 i50. ~17!\nBefore presenting the numerical results, we derive some im-\nportant general features of the MPEPs and Smin(t). We show\nin the following that, as the boundary moves from the close\nvicinity of the bottom toward the saddle, J(t) undergoes\nqualitative changes while still being stepwise.\nFirst, consider the case when the absorbing wall is close\nto the bottom: U(q) may then be approximated by a parabola\n@Fig. 2~a!#\nU~q !2U~qb!\u2019\nv0\n2\n2\n~q2qb!2, ~18!\nwhere v05A2 and qb521, in the case of U(q) ~3!. Thus\n~15! reduces to a linear equation with constant coefficients\nthat can be integrated explicitly. Smin(t) can be found explic-\nitly too. Rather than presenting some cumbersome formulas\nwe discuss their most important consequence: If G,2v0 ,\nthen Smin(t) has a stepwise shape @Fig. 2~b!#, i.e., possesses\ninflection points with dSmin \/dt50 at\nt5tn[\nnp\nv0A12~G\/2v0!2\n,\n~19!\nS~ tn!5\nDUp\n12exp~2Gtn!\n,\nDUp[v0\n2~qaw2qb!2\/2, G,2v0 , n51,2,3, . . . .\nThe flux barely changes near tn whereas it rises sharply be-\nyond this range provided the corresponding n is not too\nlarge25 @Fig. 2~b!#. In the underdamped case, the \u2018\u2018length\u2019\u2019 of\neach step, tn112tn , is half a period of eigenoscillation and\nthe \u2018\u2018height\u2019\u2019 of the first steps is large: S(tn)2S(tn11)\n\u2019DUpv0 \/(pGn(n11)) \u2014\u2014\u2192\nG\u21920\n\u2018 . As G grows, the length\nof a step increases while the height decreases and, at G\n52v0 , the steps vanish.\nThe instants tn mark intervals corresponding to different\ntopologies of the MPEP: For t<t1 , @q(t)# is monotonic\nwhile, for tn,t<tn11 (n51,2,3, . . . ), @q(t)# possesses n\nturning points. As t changes, the MPEP varies continuously\nfor any t, including t5tn . The exit velocity is nonzero unless\nt5tn @Fig. 2~a!#.\n598 Chaos, Vol. 11, No. 3, 2001 Soskin et al.Apart from a quantitative description of the case when\nthe wall is close to the bottom of the well, the parabolic\napproximation provides qualitative estimates of the time and\nenergy scales of the steps in the general case. However, some\nfeatures of the steps Smin(t) and of the associated evolution\nof the MPEP change qualitatively as the absorbing wall\nmoves toward the saddle.\nLet us move the absorbing wall qaw to a distinctly non-\nparabolic region of U(q), but still not too close to the saddle\n(,qaw(c)) .

In or-\nder to find the activation energy at a given t one should\nchoose from the solutions of ~13!, ~15!\u2013~17! the minimal\none. There are switches between different branches at certain\ncritical times. These can be compared to switching processes,\nas other parameters vary, in certain escape problems;22,21,18\nsee also Sec. III. The switches result in jumpwise changes of\nthe MPEP while the activation energy still remains continu-\nous @Fig. 3~c!#. At the same time, the switch results in a\ndiscontinuity dSmin \/dt: Its values on different sides of the\nfold differ drastically, so that Smin(t) and J(t) are still dis-\ntinctly stepwise ~stair-like!.\nWe have tested some of the above-mentioned predictions\nusing computer simulations. Smin(t) is derived via optimal\nfitting of J(t) obtained at different T. Figures 2~b! and 3\nshow reasonable agreement between Smin(t) from the theory\nand from the simulations. The growth of the flux is clearly\nstepwise ~see insets! in both cases.\nB. Nonbottom initial state with a given coordinate\nand velocity\nIf the initial state with a given coordinate and velocity,\n$qi ,q\u02d9 i%, is shifted from the bottom of the well $qb,0% then\nSmin(t) changes: cf. Fig. 4. In particular, Smin(t) becomes\nnonmonotonic. Moreover, as is evident in Fig. 4, even a tiny\nshift of the energy from the bottom results in quite a signifi-\ncant distortion of Smin(t): The shift of energy in Fig. 4~a! and\n4~b! is equal to DUp\/100 and DUp\/200, respectively. Such\nstrong sensitivity to the initial state can be explained by the\nsingularity in the effective time-dependent damping param-\neter in Eq. ~23!, which describes the MPEP; so, the shift in\nthe activation energy depends nonanalytically on the shift of\nthe energy of the initial state.\nC. Thermalized initial state\nA nonbottom initial state with a given coordinate and\nvelocity might seem a rather artificial situation but, at the\nsame time, there is always some nonzero initial temperature\nT0 so that various nonbottom states are necessarily involved.\nThe strong sensitivity of the flux Jqi ,q\u02d9 i(t) to the shift of\n$qi ,q\u02d9 i% from the bottom, appears to cast doubt on the gen-\nerality of the stepwise growth J in real situations. However, a\nrigorous analysis ~see the following! shows that the flux at\nshort time scales still grows in a stepwise manner for any\ntemperature T0,T . Moreover, if T0 \/T!G\/v0 , then the\nstepwise structure for flux growth is similar to that obtained\nusing the bottom as the initial state.\nSo, let the distribution of initial coordinates and veloci-\nties be quasistationary for some low temperature T0 :\n600 Chaos, Vol. 11, No. 3, 2001 Soskin et al.W in~q0 ,q\u02d9 0!5Wqs~q0 ,q\u02d9 0!\n\u2019H Z21 exp~2E0 \/T0! for E0,U~qaw!0 for E0.U~qaw! ,\n~26!\nE0[q\u02d9 0\n2\/21U~q0!,\nZ5E E\nE0,U~qaw!\ndq0 dq\u02d9 0 exp~2E0 \/T0!.\nWe assume that the probability for the system to leave the\nwell before the relevant \u2018\u2018initial\u2019\u2019 instant t50 is negligible.\nIf at the \u2018\u2018initial\u2019\u2019 instant t50 the additional noise source\nis switched on, so that the effective temperature becomes T\n.T0 ,30 the evolution of the flux ~6! with the initial distribu-\ntion ~26! becomes relevant.

MULTIWELL METASTABLE POTENTIAL\nAs an example of the multiwell case, we consider the\npotential ~4!, which describes the simplest SQUID.2 We\nplace an absorbing wall8 at qaw54.5 @Fig. 6~a!# while the\ninitial state of the system ~1!, ~4! may be any state within\nwell 1; in simulations, we put it at the bottom of well 1, for\nthe sake of simplicity. We emphasize also that the type of the\nboundary is not important either, e.g., our results are equally\nvalid for the transition rates between nonadjacent wells in the\nstable potential with more than two wells.21\nUnlike the single-well case, where the formation time of\nquasiequilibrium is of the order of t f\n(s) ~7!, its formation in\nthe multiwell case proceeds via two distinct stages: first, qua-\nsiequilibrium is formed within the initial well, which takes\nt f\n(1);t f\n(s) : J evolves at this stage quite similarly31 to the\nsingle-well case; second, quasiequilibrium between wells be-\ncomes established, which takes exponentially longer: t f\n(2)\n;t f\n(s)exp(DU\/T)@tf(1) where DU means a minimal internal\nbarrier. During the latter stage, and during the subsequent\nquasistationary one, the flux J(t) can be described via a so-\nlution of kinetic equations for the well populations, W1 and\nW2 , using the concept of constant interattractor32 transition\nrates a i j ~cf. Ref. 33!:\nJ~ t ![W1a131W2a23\n5a13e\n2 t\/t f\n~2 !\n1aqs~e\n2t\/tqs2e2 t\/t f\n~2 !\n!,\nt f\n~2 !\u2019a12\n21\n, tqs\u2019aqs\n21\u2019a12 \/~a12a231a21a13!, ~31!\nT!Us12U1 , t@t f\n~1 !\n.\nThe physical meaning of the two terms in ~31! is easily un-\nderstood ~cf. Fig. 6!. The first one corresponds to direct es-\ncapes, i.e., those that do not go via the bottom of well 2, and\nit dominates until quasiequilibrium becomes established. The\nsecond term, corresponding to indirect escapes, i.e., those\nthat involve one or more intermediate transitions between\nwells 1 and 2 while the ultimate transition to 3 may occur\nfrom either well. It dominates during the ensuing quasista-\ntionary stage: It is the asymptotic part of this latter flux,\naqsexp(2t\/tqs), that is called the quasistationary flux.\nThus, in order to know the flux dynamics one needs to\nfind the interwell transition rates a i j . The rates a12 ,a21 and\nthe quasistationary rate aqs can be calculated from the\nKramers\u2013Melnikov formula.4 Thus, only one of the two co-\nefficients a13 and a23 needs to be found independently. We\nchoose a13 as the independent coefficient.\n602 Chaos, Vol. 11, No. 3, 2001 Soskin et al.The theoretical problem of finding a13 is inherently dif-\nficult. Melnikov pointed out4 that, in the multiwell case, his\nmethod is valid only if the barriers levels are equal or at least\nclose to each other ~cf., e.g., Refs. 4 and 34!, a requirement\nthat is often not satisfied. So, the method of optimal fluctua-\ntion ~cf. Sec. II! was suggested,21 seeking the escape rate in\nthe form\na135Pe2 Smin \/T, ~32!\nwhere the action Smin does not depend on T and the depen-\ndence of the prefactor P on T is relatively weak.\nOne can show that Smin is the minimum of a certain\nfunctional21\nSmin[Smin~1\u2192s2!5min@q~ t !# ,t tr~S !,\nS[St tr@q~ t !#5\n1\n4GE0\nt tr\ndt~q\u00a8 1Gq\u02d9 1dU\/dq !2, ~33!\nq~0 !5q1 , q\u02d9 ~0 !50, q~ t tr!5qs2, q\u02d9 ~ t tr!50,\nwhere the trajectory @q(t)# does not pass through attractor 2.\nIt can easily be shown that the t tr yielding Smin is equal to \u2018 .\nThe @q(t)# yielding Smin is called21 the most probable direct\ntransition path ~MPDTP!.

Note\nthat, in general, there may be an infinite set of A providing\n@qd(t)# connecting the saddles: The corresponding trajecto-\nries differ by their number of turning points. But S for the\nother values of A @whose absolute values are smaller than\nuA2u] is larger than that for A2.\nThe underdamped region, G<G1 , is divided by a num-\nber of characteristic values of the friction Gn>1 . Each of\nthese Gn provides for a noise-free saddle connection\ns2\u2192\nnf\ns1 , which possesses n21 turning points. In this region,\nDS(G) undergoes oscillations corresponding to an alterna-\ntion between two situations. In the first, @G2m ,G2m21# (m\n>1), a noise-free trajectory s2\u2192\nnf\n1 exists and the MPDTP is\njust its time reversal, with DS50. In the second situation,\n@G2m11 ,G2m# (m>1), the action varies nonmonotonically\nwith G , and has cusps. This is due to a competition between\nthe two paths which are the time reversals respectively, of\ns2\u2192\nA2\ns1\u2192\nnf\n1 and s2\u2192\nA1\ns1\u2192\nnf\n1, where s2\u2192\nA6\ns1 are given by the\nsolutions of ~35! with A1[A1(G).0 and A2[A2(G)\n,0, respectively: see Fig. 8~b! and 8~c!, respectively. As G\nvaries, S along one path becomes equal to S along another, at\na certain G , leading to switching between the paths and to\nthe cusp in DS(G): There are corresponding discontinuities\nin the nonequilibrium potential23 and fluctuational\nseparatrix.36\nThus, Ref. 21 predicts an exponentially strong depen-\ndence of the escape rate a13 on friction, including interesting\nfeatures such as oscillations and cusps,37 for t@t f\n(1)\n. To es-\ntablish whether these, and the properties of MPDTPs de-\nscribed previously, occur in reality, we have undertaken ana-\nlog electronic and computer simulations. A necessary\ncondition is smallness of the temperature: T!DS ,(Us1\n2U1). However to obtain reasonable statistics at such a\nsmall temperature would require an unrealistically long time\n@}exp((Us22U11DS)\/T)#.\n38 We have overcome this diffi-\nculty by exploiting the property of detailed balance,39 which\nimplies21 that the MPDTP s2\u21921 is just the time reversal of\nthe MPDTP 1\u2192s2 , with the corresponding actions differing\nby Us22U1 , i.e.,\nDS~1\u2192s2!5Smin~s2\u21921 !\n5H 0 at s2\u2192nf 1\nSmin~s2\u2192s1! at s2\u2192\nnf\n2\n~36!so that information about the transition s2\u21921 is equivalent\nto that for 1\u2192s2 , but the experimental time required is of\ncourse much smaller in the former case @}exp(DS\/T)# than in\nthe latter.\nFigure 8~a! demonstrates that, for GP@G1 ,G0# , most of\nthe direct paths s2\u21921 do indeed concentrate near\ns2\u2192\nA2\ns1\u2192\nnf\n1. Figures 8~b! and 8~c! demonstrate switching of\nthe MPDTP from s2\u2192\nA1\ns1\u2192\nnf\n1 to s2\u2192\nA2\ns1\u2192\nnf\n1 as G decreases\nin the range @G3 ,G2# .\nIn order to study Smin we use the following technique.\nThe system is put at s2 , and one then follows its stochastic\ndynamics ~1!, ~4! until either the bottom of one of the wells\nis approached or the coordinate qaw is reached. After that, the\nsystem is reset to s2 and the operation is repeated.

That is why the use of ~38!\nmay, in practice, introduce significant inaccuracy. To reduce\nthe influence of the preexponential factor we measure R both\nat Tl and at a slightly higher temperature, Tl1DT (Tl@DT\n*Tl\n2\/Smin(s2\u2192s1)), so that\n6Smin~s2\u2192s1!\u2019\nTl\n2\nDT\nlnS R~Tl1DT !R~Tl!

This occurs if the\ninitial well 1 is adjacent to an external saddle s2 while its\ndepth is much less than that of the other well.\nFinally, we comment on the experimental consequence\nof the cutoff of the MPDTP, namely the drastic change of the\ntime evolution of J for t f\n(1)&t!t f\n(2) : At G,G0 , one may in\nprinciple make T small enough that the sharp growth of J(t)\nat t&t f\n(1) turns into a nearly constant value at t f\n(1)!t\n!t f\n(1)a13 \/(a12a23) while, at G.G0 , J(t)\u2019a12a23t over the\nwhole relevant time-scale: cf. the thin full and dashed lines\nin Fig. 6~b!. Another drastic change occurs with the time\nevolution of the transition flux s2\u21921: At G,G0 , it has a\n604 Chaos, Vol. 11, No. 3, 2001 Soskin et al.high narrow peak at t\u2019t f\n(1) whereas, at G.G0 , it is a mono-\ntonically and very slowly growing function of t, at t&t f\n(2)\n.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS AND OPEN PROBLEMS\nWe conclude that: ~i! escape from the metastable part of\na potential differs markedly after and before the formation of\nquasiequilibrium within the metastable region; ~ii! at time\nscales much less than the time of the formation of quasiequi-\nlibrium within a single well t f\n(s)\n, the escape flux J grows\nexponentially strongly with time and, moreover, if the fric-\ntion G is small, it does so in a stepwise manner and depends\nexponentially strongly on G; and ~iii! if the metastable part\nof the potential consists of more than one well, then the\nformation of quasiequilibrium takes an exponentially long\nperiod of time. In the latter case, the escape flux during the\nmost of the period is formed from direct escapes and depends\nexponentially strongly on friction; moreover, J(G) under-\ngoes oscillations in the underdamped range and may drop\ndrastically if G exceeds a critical value G0>2V2 .\nOpen problems yet to be addressed include the follow-\ning.\n~1!

Erratum ~to be published!.\n14 If the wall is close to the bottom, the estimate ~7! can be obtained by\nconsideration of the parabolic potential: The Fokker\u2013Planck equation is\nthen solved explicitly ~Ref. 15!. It follows directly that, if the initial state\ncorresponds to the bottom of the well, i.e., W(q ,q\u02d9 ,t50)5d(q\n2qb)d(q\u02d9 ), then W near the energy level DU and the coordinate\nA2DU\/v0 evolves close to the equilibrium value for the time described\nby Eq. ~7!. In another characteristic case, when the wall is close to the\nsaddle ~cf. qaw(3) in Fig. 2!, the estimate ~7! is also typically valid: It agrees\nwith the explicit results ~Ref. 6! for the underdamped and overdamped\nlimits provided that the curvatures at the saddle and at the bottom are of\nthe same order, which in fact is typically the case: cf. U(q) ~1!.\n15 M. C. Wang and G. E. Uhlenbeck, Rev. Mod.

The reduction of the asymptotic ~at\nt\u2192\u2018) activation energy and MPEP to their conventional forms is valid\nfor an arbitrary U(q).\n26 L. D. Landau and E. M. Lifshitz, Mechanics ~Pergamon, London, 1976!.\n27 To avoid the singularities encountered by G8 at the turning points, one\nmay use the variable G[G8q\u02d9 instead.\n28 A similar equation was obtained in Ref. 23 but in a different context and\nby a different method.\n29 The numerical search is more difficult than in the case of a single solution.\nDetails will be presented elsewhere.\n30 Note that the additional noise source does not need necessarily a thermal\norigin. In SQUIDs, for example, it could be an external magnetic flux\nnoise.\n31 Our qualitative analysis indicates that, in addition, some new features may\nappear in the multiwell case, but this has not yet been studied in detail.\n32 For the sake of brevity, we refer to region 3 as an \u2018\u2018attractor\u2018\u2018 too.\n33 M.

However, the obvi-\nous reason that oscillations and cusps were not found in those studies is\nthat they can only arise in the case of distinctly different barriers levels.\n38 Note, however that preexponential time scales in other systems ~e.g., in\nSQUIDs! may be much smaller, so that the relevant flux may be readily\nsimulated and\/or measured.\n39 H.
