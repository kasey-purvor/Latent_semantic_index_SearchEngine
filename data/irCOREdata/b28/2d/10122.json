The various uses of the word \u2018trauma\u2019 are\nexplored and its application to the refugee context is examined. It is proposed that\nrefugees\u2019 response to adversity is not limited to being traumatized but includes\nresilience and Adversity-Activated Development (AAD). Particular emphasis is given\nto the distinction between resilience and AAD. The usefulness of the \u2018Trauma Grid\u2019\nin the therapeutic process with refugees is also discussed. The Trauma Grid avoids\nglobal impressions and enables a more comprehensive and systematic way of\nidentifying the individual refugee\u2019s functioning in the context of different levels,\ni.e. individual, family, community and society\/culture. Finally, I discuss implications\nfor therapeutic work with refugees.\nKeywords: Refugees, asylum seekers, trauma, \u2018Trauma Grid\u2019, Adversity-Activated\nDevelopment, resilience\nPreliminary considerations\nTo begin with, it is important to remember the obvious fact that becoming\na refugee1 is not a psychological phenomenon per se; rather, it is exclusively a\nsocio-political and legal one, with psychological implications. Ordinary people\nbecome refugees because they are forced, directly or indirectly, to abandon\ntheir homes as a result of certain political and\/or military actions by some\nCorrespondence: Renos K.

This means that people become refugees as a consequence of\na certain set of socio-political circumstances, attempting to begin a new life\nusing legal means in order to be allowed to settle in another location. In trying\nto complete the move from their home of origin to a new and safer home,\nthe process that leads from dislocation to relocation, refugees have a\nmultitude of needs. These needs are multi-faceted and multi-dimensional\n(Papadopoulos, 2001) and may cover the entire spectrum of human needs \u2013\nfrom the basics of human survival (safety, food and shelter) to the higher ones\nin Maslow\u2019s (1943) hierarchy of needs, such as the need for love, belonging,\nstatus, self-esteem and self-actualization.\nIf they are fortunate enough during their ordeal of dislocation and\nrelocation, refugees are offered humanitarian assistance to ensure, initially,\ntheir safety and basic survival and then their overall transition to their new\nlives. During this process they may require different types of help depending\non their specific needs as they unfold. Having survived adversity and many\nstruggles, refugees tend to be resilient and resourceful and, if they encounter\nreasonably facilitative conditions, the majority of them can and do manage on\ntheir own with minimal or no assistance. However, some refugees may require\nhelp with some or with most of their needs.\nOne way of conceptualizing the kind and amount of help refugees require is\nto relate it to the degree they are able to retain their capacity for resilience and\nresourcefulness. Once this capacity is negatively affected, then it is likely\nthat they will need more help and in more areas of their functioning.\nIt is reasonable to assume that this ability is related to what could be referred\nto as a \u2018psychological immune system\u2019. Therefore, the more this \u2018system\u2019 is\ndamaged, the more help the affected refugees are likely to require in ever more\nareas of their lives.\nI mentioned at the outset the obvious fact that the phenomena of becoming\nand being a refugee are not, in themselves, of a psychological nature.\nThis needs to be emphasized because there is a tendency by mental health\nprofessionals to approach the state of being a refugee as if it were a\npsychological, or indeed a psychopathological, state. Once this is established,\nit is then possible to examine more meaningfully the ways that mental health\nperspectives can be of relevance and, indeed, of benefit to the refugee\nsituation. I would suggest that there are at least two possible ways that this\ncan be done. The first relates to the way we consider the psychological\nimplications of experiences during the entire process of dislocation\nand relocation; undeniably, each situation of need (e.g. for safety,\nmedical attention, housing, financial support or anything else) can have\na psychological impact on the person concerned. The second relates to the\nway that the \u2018psychological immune system\u2019 is damaged in a person; this is\na highly individual matter because each human being has their own specific\nand idiosyncratic way of reacting to external devastating events. Yet this basic\nand undeniable psychological principle can be undermined by the usual\ntheories of psychological trauma, which are based on the assumption that\ncertain external events, on their own, are traumatic to all people; hence, they\n302 R. K. Papadopoulos\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n11\n:0\n2 \n17\n J\nun\ne \n20\n10\nare referred to as \u2018traumatic events\u2019 instead of being considered as\n\u2018traumatizing experiences\u2019 for some persons. The lack of distinction between\nthe event itself and the impact or experience of the event is of crucial\nimportance (Papadopoulos, 2005). Mental health professionals may be called\nupon to work with refugees in connection either with facets of the first\ncategory and\/or with the second category. However, in both situations there\nis a danger of considering refugees as a homogeneous group of people,\nas if they belonged to a clearly defined psychological or psychiatric\ndiagnostic category.\nIn everyday language, the word \u2018refugee\u2019 is used to refer to a \u2018a displaced\nperson\u2019, a person who \u2018seeks refuge in a foreign country . . . owing to religious\npersecution or political troubles\u2019 or \u2018[s]omeone driven from his home by war\nor the fear of attack or persecution\u2019 (Oxford English Dictionary). The term\n\u2018refugee\u2019 has a highly specific legal connotation and is restricted to persons\nwho have fled to another country and asked for asylum on the grounds of\na \u2018well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion,\nnationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion\u2019\n(International Refugee Convention, 1951, article 1A.2). The confusion\nbetween the everyday and the legal definitions of the word refugee may\ncomplicate the already complex process from dislocation to relocation.\nMore specifically, asylum seekers (and their professional helpers) may have\nexpectations in terms of their rights as refugees which may clash with the legal\nformulation of their status as refugees; although the issue may be exclusively\nlegal, nevertheless, it can also have significant practical and psychological\neffects on the persons concerned.\n\u2018Refugee trauma\u2019, psychological trauma, post-traumatic stress\ndisorder and \u2018societal trauma\u2019\nThe refugees\u2019 capacity for resilience and for accessing their own\nresourcefulness can be adversely affected if their \u2018psychological immune\nsystem\u2019 is damaged. This may occur as a result of a wide variety of possible\nfactors before and during the dislocation\u2013relocation process. Regardless\nof the specific nature of circumstances that initially trigger this damage,\npsychologists tend to use trauma theory to approach these phenomena\nas it seems that this theory (which is by no means a single and\nunified theory) approximates in the closest possible way to the nature of\nwhat actually occurs.\nIt is important to differentiate between what is referred to as \u2018refugee\ntrauma\u2019 (e.g. Alcock, 2003; Boehnlein & Kinzie, 1995) and psychological\ntrauma. The former is a general term that covers the whole spectrum of\nphenomena connected with the specific refugee reality and range\nof experiences; the latter refers to the psychological effect of being traumatized\nregardless of the external causes. It is logical to assume that involuntarily\nlosing one\u2019s home is a difficult experience that may have adverse psychological\nimplications. However, the term \u2018refugee trauma\u2019 implies something more\nthan that \u2013 it presupposes that all those who experience this kind of adversity\nRefugees, trauma and Adversity-Activated Development 303\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n11\n:0\n2 \n17\n J\nun\ne \n20\n10\nwill become psychologically traumatized. This presupposition is not\nvalid because we know that each person perceives, digests and responds\nto external situations in a highly unique and individual way, and not\nall refugees are traumatized in a psychological or, even less so, in a\npsychopathological sense.\nPsychological reactions to adversity and the devastating consequences\nof having to go into exile can vary enormously from individual to individual;\neach person experiences external devastating events in a very individual way\nthat depends on a number of different factors. This means that the mere\nexistence of certain devastating events should not lead to a conclusion that\nevery person exposed to them is likely to be psychologically traumatized.\nAt the same time, it would be equally correct to assume that the events that\nrefugees experience must cause them some degree of psychological\ndiscomfort, upset, upheaval, turmoil, pain, disruption or even disturbance.\nAnother related notion widely used in these situations is that of \u2018societal\ntrauma\u2019. This kind of \u2018trauma\u2019 implies that a whole group of people,\na community or even an entire society has been \u2018traumatized\u2019. Societal trauma\nrefers to a broader category of disturbance that society may experience as\na result of different upheavals that affect (directly or indirectly, materially\nor psychologically) larger segments of society. These upheavals may be caused\neither by human intervention (e.g. war, unrest, oppression, persecution,\npopulation dislocation, economic collapse) or natural disaster (e.g. flood,\nearthquake, epidemic).\nTrauma\nOften, persons who have experienced adversity find it difficult to connect\nwith their previous ways of being, to return to their previous way of life.\nThe adversity experiences are so overwhelming that they tend to erase most\nprevious experiences. This erasing is likely to create a sense of disorientation\nwhich may either spur them on to new ways of being or throw them off\nbalance with detrimental effects.\nHaving differentiated the various types of trauma connected with the\nrefugee situation, I now want to focus on the very term \u2018trauma\u2019. In Greek,\ntrauma means \u2018injury\u2019 or \u2018wound\u2019 and, metaphorically, in psychology and\npsychiatry refers to a psychological injury, a deficit, a pathological state.\nRecent etymological research (Papadopoulos 2000, 2001, 2002a, 2002b)\nreveals that the root verb teiro (which means \u2018to rub\u2019) has two connotations:\nto rub in and to rub off, or rub away. Thus, trauma would be the mark left on\npersons as a result of something being rubbed onto them. Then, in so far as\nthe rubbing is of two kinds, we could have two different outcomes:\nfrom \u2018rubbing in\u2019 \u2013 an injury, a wound \u2013 and from \u2018rubbing off\u2019 or \u2018rubbing\naway\u2019 \u2013 a clean surface where previous marks were erased.\nWith reference to the trauma approach to refugees, these two meanings\nof trauma have important consequences. The first meaning of trauma\n(rubbing in and resulting in injury) is by far the dominant one in use.\nWe consider persons who become refugees as being traumatized and in need\n304 R. K. Papadopoulos\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n11\n:0\n2 \n17\n J\nun\ne \n20\n10\nof help, which, of course, may be true. However, if we are not careful, this\nvery reasonable approach can have some fairly negative consequences, such\nas learned helplessness or other iatrogenic effects. The second meaning of\ntrauma (rubbing off, rubbing away, resulting in the acquisition of new\nperspectives on life) is less noticeable, although not less possible. It is well\nknown that following a difficult and intense experience, people may respond\nin ways that emphasize the renewing rather than the injurious effects of the\nexperience. Despite (or even because of) the pain, disorientation, disruption,\ndevastation and loss, people may still feel that the very same \u2018traumatic\u2019\nexperience also made them re-evaluate their priorities in life, change their\nlife-styles and acquire new values \u2013 all in all, experiencing a substantial change\nand renewal in their lives. Having come so close to death or having\nexperienced the unbearable anguish of substantial losses, people often emerge\ntransformed, re-viewing life, themselves and their relationships. This means\nthat, paradoxically, despite their negative nature, devastating experiences\n(regardless of the degree of their harshness and destructive impact) may also\nhelp people reshuffle their lives and imbue them with new meaning.\nTherefore, logically, the range of possible effects from trauma must fall into\nthree categories: negative, positive and neutral. At the outset it must be\nemphasized that each possibility may not be exclusive. This means that,\ndespite the fact that a person is traumatized, he or she may also gain from\nthe experience.\nNegative effects of trauma\nThe first negative effect is the actual psychological injury that can lead to a\ngenuine pathological condition of shorter or longer duration. There is no\ndoubt that certain people are indeed traumatized by the devastating effects of\nexternal events such as destruction of their homes, killing of their loved ones,\nloss of property, community or personal status. However, within this category\nwe can identify at least three degrees of severity:\n1. Ordinary human suffering (OHS): this is the most common and human\nresponse to tragedies in life. Suffering occurs when our expectations of\na smooth life are not fulfilled. This does not always amount to a\npathological condition; suffering is part of life and it is not always\nnecessary to locate it in a medical or pathological context. Persons with\nsufficiently intact psychological immune systems are able to \u2018digest\u2019\nadversity within the context of a healthy philosophy of life in addition\nto making use of the resources of various support systems within their\nfamily and community.\n2. Distressful psychological reaction (DPR): this is a more severe form of\nOHS and it involves a stronger experience of discomfort. However,\nDPR does not always require specialist attention. Distressful experi-\nences are not uncommon in life and ordinary human resilience can deal\nwith them effectively without the need of any professional intervention.\nRefugees, trauma and Adversity-Activated Development 305\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n11\n:0\n2 \n17\n J\nun\ne \n20\n10\n3. Psychiatric disorder (PD): this is the severest form of the negative\nconsequences of exposure to adversity and it certainly requires specialist\nprofessional treatment. The most common type of this effect is post-\ntraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and most of the literature on refugees\nexperiencing trauma tends to be focused on this disorder.\nThe differentiation between these three different types of negative effects\nof being exposed to adverse situations in the context of the refugee situation\nmeans that not all traumatic experiences are of the PTSD type, which\nthe majority of the literature seems to suggest.\nPositive effects of trauma\nThe second category of possible responses to adversity by refugees refers\nto phenomena that tend to be neglected by mainstream professional theories\nand practices. Undoubtedly, there are refugees who not only survive the\ninhuman and cruel conditions they have endured with a significant degree of\nintactness but, moreover, they become strengthened by their particular\nexposure to adversity. It is for this reason that this response has been termed\n\u2018Adversity-Activated Development\u2019 (AAD) (Papadopoulos, 2004, 2006).\nAAD refers to the positive developments that are a direct result of being\nexposed to adversity. There are endless accounts of individuals and groups\nwho found meaning in their suffering and were able to transmute their\nnegative experiences in a positive way, finding new strength and experiencing\ntransformative renewal. Such accounts are not just moving testimonies of the\nstrength of the human spirit but they also challenge the predominant societal\ndiscourse of trauma (that implies that trauma is pathological and requires\nspecialist attention) and the tendency to medicalize and pathologize human\nsuffering. Once they realize that they have survived the initial and\nlife-threatening adversity, refugees have the opportunity to begin to appreciate\nlife in its own right; it is not uncommon that in the light of this\nnew transformation, refugees percieve their previous lives as relatively\nmeaningless. Nevertheless, this seemingly paradoxical outcome may create\nawkward moral dilemmas and complexities when mental health professionals\nwork with such refugees, as one does not wish to focus on the positive\noutcomes of despicable acts of political violence. This means that other\nconsiderations (e.g. legal or ethical) may prevent therapists from acknowl-\nedging fully any AAD responses in refugees who are in psychological\ntreatment.\nTransforming adversity into positive development is a phenomenon that has\nalways been known to humans. It is interesting to note that these ideas entered\nthe specialist trauma literature relatively late. However, psychologists such as\nCarl Jung, Victor Frankl and others identified these phenomena using different\nterminologies much earlier than this specialist literature appeared. Using his\npersonal experiences of being a concentration camp inmate during the Second\nWorld War, Frankl (1959) demonstrated how giving meaning to suffering can\nbe transformative. Jung emphasized the positive meaning of symptoms and\n306 R. K. Papadopoulos\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n11\n:0\n2 \n17\n J\nun\ne \n20\n10\nargued that pathology is the individual\u2019s attempt to redress certain imbalances\nin their psychological world (e.g. Jung 1931, 1943, 1945, 1951).\nIn the last two decades, the trauma literature has experienced an influx\nof these ideas using different terminologies to address the same positive\nresponse to adversity. These include terms such as stress-related growth,\ncrisis-related growth or development, thriving in adversity, post-trauma\ngrowth, positive transformation following trauma, positive transformation\nof suffering, to name but a few (see Affleck & Tennen, 1996; Folkman, 1997;\nHarvey, 1996). It seems that the predominant term in this field\nis post-traumatic growth (PTG) (see Tedeschi & Calhoun, 1996; Tedeschi,\nPark, & Calhoun, 1998) and it may be instructive to examine the differences\nbetween AAD and PTG.\n1. The central point of departure for PTG is trauma. PTG assumes that\neverybody who is experiencing PTG must have been traumatized.\nAAD is not based on this assumption. By making use of adversity as its\nbase rather than trauma, AAD makes the subtle but important\ndifferentiation between being exposed to adversity and being\ntraumatized.\n2. PTG assumes that \u2018growth\u2019 occurs after the trauma; the post in PTG\nechoes the post in PTSD. AAD is not based on this assumption because\n(a) the adversity may still continue; refugees may still experience\nadverse conditions (or even traumatizing ones) after their initial\npsychological disruption of dislocation (i.e. initial \u2018trauma\u2019). As is\nknown, refugees may experience further adversity (of a different\nkind) during the process of relocation in their new and safe\nlocation (Silove, McIntosh, & Becker, 1993).\n(b) the positive effects may have been experienced even during\n(not after) the period of adversity. There are many accounts of\npersons who had developed AAD responses during the initial\nphase of maximum adversity.\n3. PTG uses the term \u2018growth\u2019 to refer to the positive effects, whereas\nADD uses \u2018development\u2019. Apart from the fact that \u2018growth\u2019 may also\nhave a negative connotation as in \u2018morbid formation\u2019 such as cancer,\nwith its organic image growth suggests a degree of inevitability,\nwhereas \u2018development\u2019 is a more neutral term that allows for a wider\nvariation of positive responses.\nMore specifically, AAD is characterized by the emergence of:\n. Positive, \u2018growthful\u2019 developments which are a direct result of\nthe experiences gained from being exposed to adversity\/\u2018trauma\u2019.\n. New elements \u2013 characteristics which did not exist prior to\nthe adversity.\nIt is important to emphasize that these new and positive characteristics are not\nalways known to the individual him\/herself. Often, they may be visible\nto others and they should be noticeable to mental health professionals.\nRefugees, trauma and Adversity-Activated Development 307\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n11\n:0\n2 \n17\n J\nun\ne \n20\n10\nIndividuals are not always aware of them as their attention tends to be turned\nto the direction of deficit, what they had lost, their pain, their \u2018trauma\u2019.\nThis predominant direction is particularly accentuated when they seek help\nand they wish, as part of the overall culture of service provision, to emphasize\ntheir deficits and losses rather than their gains.\nAdversity-Activated Development (AAD) is generated because adversity\nexposes the limits of individuals. When adversity strikes, it pushes people\nto the edge of (and even over) their previous understanding and expectations.\nUsually people feel that their lives have come to an end and they do not know\nhow to proceed. This reaching of limits can be experienced as transforma-\ntional in so far as it may then open up new horizons beyond what was\npreviously planned or even imagined. When AAD is triggered off then new\nperceptions emerge of oneself (of one\u2019s identity), of one\u2019s relationships and,\nultimately, of one\u2019s meaning and purpose of life. Consequently, a new\nepistemology (a new way of understanding how one knows) emerges which\nis the sum total of all new perceptions that lead to the acquisition of a new way\nof understanding, speaking, relating about oneself, others and life itself.\nThe third possible response refugees may have to adversity is that\nof resilience.\nNeutral responses to trauma\nIt is important to emphasize that existing literature does not distinguish\nbetween AAD and resilience. Anything that does not fall within the negative\nspectrum of effects tends to be termed \u2018resilience\u2019, yet it is also important to\ndifferentiate between AAD and resilience.\nResilience is a term that in physics refers to the ability of a body not to alter\nafter being subjected to different severe conditions \u2013 that is why resilience is\nhere classed as a \u2018neutral\u2019 response. By extension, we refer to objects (such as\na car, for example) as resilient if they can endure adverse conditions.\nThen, metaphorically, we refer to a person, a family or a community as\nresilient if they withstand pressures and do not alter their basic values, skills or\nabilities. The key characteristic of resilience is that it retains qualities that\nexisted before, whereas AAD introduces new characteristics that did not exist\nbefore the adversity.\nDespite being exposed to the most devastating nature of the events, not\neverybody is crushed by them. In fact, the majority of individuals do\nnot require professional attention because a great deal of their healthy\nfunctioning remains intact and unaffected by the devastation; that is, it does\nnot change \u2013 either negatively or positively. It is indeed remarkable to see the\ndignity and resilience of the human spirit triumphing over the most appalling\nconditions of degradation, helplessness, humiliation, actual injury and loss.\nIn the last couple of decades, professional attention to issues of resilience in\nthis field (but also in the wider sphere of mental health care) has\nincreased dramatically (Cicchetti & Luthar, 2003; Clarke & Clarke, 2003;\nWerner & Smith, 1992; Wolin & Wolin, 1993).\n308 R.

More specifically,\nthe grid assists therapists to appreciate that, whereas a person may be\ntraumatized with reference to certain functions and responses, under\ncertain circumstances and conditions and at certain times, the very\nsame person may also be resilient in relation to other functions\n(e.g. he\/she may still be able to look after her\/his own hygiene\nor he\/she may be able to hold down a job).\n. no individuals are alone and every person can be affected by their\nfamily, community and culture in positive and\/or negative ways.\nEven the most isolated individuals and even those who have lost their\nentire family are still susceptible to the impact their families have on\nthem now.

In difficult situations and\nadverse circumstances, the collective meaning tends to influence the\nindividuals\u2019 value system much more than individuals are aware of.\nOften, it is thought that there is a chronological progression from the negative\nto the neutral and then to the positive effects of adversity. This means that\nrefugees may respond negatively to adversity at first, then they may regain\ncertain functions that are resilient to change and finally they may develop\nAAD functions the further they are removed chronologically from the time\nof the original exposure to adversity. However, this sequential progress\n(regardless of how logical it may sound) may not be valid for everybody.\nThe grid reminds therapists to explore the entire range of the refugees\u2019\nfunctioning in order to discern the entire spectrum of possible nuances at any\ngiven time. This means that refugees may exhibit different positive and\ndifferent negative responses simultaneously. Needless to say, as with all\nconceptual tools to comprehend complex phenomena, the grid does not\nsuggest the existence of absolute and exclusive categories and divisions but\nit provides a useful framework to be utilized creatively in the therapeutic\ninteraction with refugees.\nConclusion\nMental health professionals have a great deal to offer refugees as long as there\nis a clear understanding of the complexities involved. These complexities\ninclude the way the refugee predicament is construed by the wider society and\nby the systemic interconnections between mental health systems and refugees.\nIf these connections are not properly understood, there is a danger that\nmental health professionals may unwittingly fall into a position that fails to\ndistinguish the various overlapping epistemologies involved and they may end\nup pathologizing human suffering.\nAAD is suggested in order to increase the level of differentiation of non-\npathological responses to adversity. However, it requires further investigation.\nTherapeutic work is enormously helped if therapists identify not only the\ndifficulties, the problems, the pathology, the trauma but also the strengths and\nthe specific ways that each individual exhibits AAD functions. In addition, it is\nimportant that resilient functions are also discerned. However, both AAD and\nresilience require extremely delicate ways of being introduced into the\ntherapeutic process with refugees. A mere identification of them, performed\nas a bureaucratic exercise, is likely to have more detrimental than beneficial\neffect. Therapists need to respect deeply the pain, disorientation, losses,\ntrauma and all the other negative effects that refugees have from their\nexposure to adversity and it is in the context of this respect that they can\nthen introduce their observations about resilient and AAD functions;\n310 R.
