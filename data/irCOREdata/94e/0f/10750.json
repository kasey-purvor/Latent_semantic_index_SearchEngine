Ward's piece suggests that local\nauthorities' representations to central government, and the alignment of major inter-\nnational casino operators with them, were important routes to influence. Whilst\nlobbying per se is not a new phenomenon, there are wider issues here concerning\nthe involvement of large commercial organisations in the political and democratic\nprocess. The following commentary explores these ideas through focus on the UK's\nlargest retailer,Tesco. This is not a critique of Tesco itself; rather, the company presents\na highly illustrative case of corporate interactions and relationships with government\nin a UK context. Much of the ensuing discussion echoes some of the deliberations in\nReich's (2007) Supercapitalism. Although he looks primarily to the US, Reich argues\nconvincingly that democracy is being increasingly enfeebled as the spheres of big\nbusiness and politics become ever more entwined.\nWith Tesco's increasing market share has come, what some such as the Friends of\nthe Earth (2006) and Simms (2007) would argue is, an almost unfettered dominance\nin the supply chain. This hegemony owes much to a store building and acquisition\nprogramme that has, at turns, seen the retailer: circumvent local planning guidance,\nsuch as adding floorspace to its existing Stockport store which eventually required a\nretrospective planning application; purchase the 850 T&S store chain in 2002 without\nrecourse to the competition authorities; and exercise influence in an array of national\npolicy arenas. It is this last point that is of particular salience, as it sheds light on the\nsubtle and `long game' necessary for organisations to both gain friends and influence\nthem.\nIt is hard to imagine that the `pile it high, sell it cheap' origins of Tesco would\nmetamorphose into an organisation that participates in the policy-making processes of\nthe UK. This is especially so when one considers how retailers like Tesco often seem to\nignore or belittle policy, as witnessed in the company's belligerence in the face of\nplanning legislation described above, or its stance against new food labelling rules\n(Lawrence, 2006). However, there is good reason for such large organisations to\nbecome involved in the policy-making process. Aside from any contentious debates\nabout influencing things in their favour, if policy development simply leads to a\nstricter regulatory framework in a given area, then this can work to the benefit of\noperators like Tesco by sheer dint of their dominance within the sector. As Ambler\nand Chittenden (2005) explain:\n``One reason why large companies quite like regulation, though they would hardly\nadmit it, is that regulation creates a barrier to competition and especially from\nsmaller firms. As a previous CEO of Asda (Archie Norman) told a meeting in the\nHouse of Commons on 31 March 2004, large supermarkets like Asda or Tesco can\nafford compliance departments which smaller grocers can not. This is an important\narea for consideration as the nature of regulation is to make business more rigid\nand change more difficult.''\nDetermining the degree of influence organisations have in government is never\neasy. But in the case of Tesco, the public record of a Department of Environment,\nCommentary\nEnvironment and Planning A 2008, volume 40, pages 761^765\ndoi:10.1068\/a40249Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee session held on 29 June 2004 offers some\ninitial insight. Here, the following question was posed by Austin Mitchell MP to David\nNorth, Tesco's Corporate Social Responsibility and Government Affairs Director:\n``How frequently do you have contact with Government on these issues?'' North\nresponded:\n``I think contact of one sort or another would be almost daily, whether it is on an\nindividual issue or on wider ranging issues like obesity. Contact with Government\nis frequent'' (House of Commons, 2005).\nResponding to such calls for information from the government machine and\nproviding evidence for a myriad of policy areas might be viewed as onerous, but it is,\nseemingly, considered a worthwhile investment by Tesco. The company has provided\nwritten evidence on subjects like fair trade and development (House of Commons,\n2007), and appeared in front of a committee on issues such as obesity (House of\nCommons, 2003). Indeed, large companies in general, and Tesco in particular, are\noften invited to provide oral testimony for government. Recently (2 May 2007), for\nexample, Dan Jago, Category Director of Beers, Wines and Spirits for Tesco, was\nquizzed on European wine by a House of Lords European Union Committee.\nTesco's influence also stretches further than its core business of food retailing. At\none stage it became an organisation of choice for civil servants to garner information\nand enact policy in relation to urban regeneration. As Wrigley et al (2002, page 2109)\nput it: ``Martin Venning, Tesco's Regeneration Manager and, significantly, also its\nCorporate Affairs Manager with responsibility for handling media reaction to plan-\nning applications for new stores'' was seen as ``a high profile source of information\non the company's programme of urban regeneration development and partnerships\nin areas of social exclusion.'' One such area of social exclusion was Seacroft in Leeds,\nwhich received prominent news coverage when Tony Blair visited to see for himself\nthe physical improvements there resulting from regeneration effort. On his visit he\nspoke with those long-term unemployed recently returned into the workplace as a\nresult of a new grocery store opening. He also heard how this store had helped\nimprove the local population's access to fresh fruit and vegetables; a major plank\nof the government's healthy eating campaign. The grocery store in question was a\nTesco (http:\/\/www.prnewswire.co.uk).\nThus, the wide range of issues on which Tesco is consulted directly is impressive.\nThe purpose of this is arguably to safeguard and improve market share through a\nprocess of enlightened self-interest; a process the company is readily invited to engage\nin by Whitehall, no doubt due to a perceived legitimacy garnered from its market\nposition. There is nothing unusual in this. Indeed, the practice of civil servants seeking\nto consult experts in a field and having dialogue with a few large organisations is,\nhistorically, a well-trodden path (Hawes, 1993; May et al, 1998).\nOther routes to influence are arguably through the commissioning of research\nand its subsequent publication and level of dissemination. This could be viewed as\nbeing dependent on the research outcomes and their `fit' with the organisation's\nobjectives. For example, the work undertaken by Wrigley (2007) highlighted the\npositive role carried out by the new Tesco Express format in providing access\nto local shopping provision, findings that are also displayed on Tesco's website\n(http:\/\/www.tescocorporate.com). This can be contrasted with the work carried out\nfor Tesco by Bennison et al in 2000 (as reported in Guy, 2007, pages 183^184).\nA key finding of this unpublished commissioned research on linked shopping trips,\nan espoused aim of extant retail planning policy guidance, was that:\n``linked trips were more likely to occur in the case of town centre stores, smaller\nstores and for non car users'',\n762 Commentarybut perhaps more critically,\n``...that in absolute terms, the volume of linked activities ... was relatively small\ngiven the overall number of trips recorded in the database.''\nSuch findings provided minimal benefit in helping make the case for Tesco's store\ndevelopment programme at the time. It is noteworthy that this research was seemingly\nnever reported other than partially through Guy's recent book.\nBut large organisations such as Tesco seek to influence policy not only individually\nand independently of other organisations, most ostensibly competing retailers, but in\nconcert with them through a network of trade and professional bodies. Whilst large\ncompanies have credibility, trade associations are also seen to be an important form of\nbusiness representation (May et al, 1998) in the policy-making process. So, in the case\nof Tesco, its membership of the British Retail Consortium and the National Retail\nPlanning Forum are but two additional conduits for it to ensure its message is heard by\ncivil servants, but this time through a third party. In some instances, Tesco executives\nmay also take a leading role in subcommittees of these collective bodies. A problem in\nall of this is that civil servants may keep hearing the same `story' from different\nsources. Moreover, in a nod to Weick et al's (2005) thoughts on plausibility and sense-\nmaking, there is a danger that what they do hear might not even be the story; certainly\nnot in its entirety.\nSo how has Tesco come to its preeminent position? Whilst it has been the subject of\nopprobrium by Corporate Watch (http:\/\/www.corporatewatch.org.uk), Friends of the\nEarth (2006), and the New Economics Foundation (Simms, 2007), it has not engaged\nin any underhand dealings. And, although the company has sponsored political events\nfor no fewer than eight parties, the total amount donated has been less than \u00bb100000\nover a two-year period (Tesco, 2007, page 21). The company is also `clean' when it\ncomes to the notions of `cash for questions' and `honours for cash' that have embroiled\nsome prominent businesses and businessmen over recent years. Rather, the routes to\ninfluence have been carefully managed by a willingness to invest time and personnel in\nhaving a dialogue with government. But perhaps most telling has been Tesco's astute\nrecruitment of former senior civil servants with their tacit knowledge of the processes\ninvolved in policy making. Most prominent amongst these recruits has been Lucy\nNeville-Rolfe, who was introduced in Tesco's annual report of 2005 thus:\n``Lucy Neville-Rolfe was appointed Company Secretary to the Board on 15 March\n2004 in addition to her role as Group Corporate and Legal Affairs Director. She\njoined Tesco in 1997 from the Cabinet Office and is Non-executive Director of the\nForeign Office and Deputy Chair of the British Retail Consortium.''\nIn 2001 the company also recruited Tony Blair's private secretary, David North.\nWhere does this lead our understanding of the policy-making process? Certainly,\norganisations with significant sectoral dominance or market share are afforded an\nalmost automatic legitimacy to converse independently with government officials.\nHowever, these large organisations often have a multiple channel approach to the\npolicy debate, inasmuch as the umbrella associations and trade bodies they belong to\nmay also represent their views in the policy-making process. As a result, despite\ngovernment consulting and interacting with a seeming wide variety of stakeholder\nand interest groups, there is danger that this variety may sometimes be contrived, at\nleast to a certain extent. If this is so, then it will be no surprise if the advice and\nmessages received from `multiple' consultation in a given organisational area or sector\nare often recognisably similar.\nAt best this suggests an inherent laziness on the part of the government machine in\ngathering research and garnering opinion from what should be the widest variety of\nstakeholders. The more cynical may suggest that, just as there are clear benefits for\nCommentary 763leading companies like Tesco in getting the ear of policy makers, there might be gains\nfor government in cosying up to such organisations by not seeking to gather opinion\nmuch beyond their corporate view. Reece (2006) hints at this reciprocity with his\ncontention that ``over the last decade Tesco has reduced the cost of weekly shopping\n(helping create the low inflation this Government boasts about).''\nWhat is clear from the above is that, if developments akin to the `Tescoisation' of\nthe UK occur in retailing, or any other sector, it may be unfair to lay the blame for this\nentirely at the door of the organisation in question. Rather, it may also be a failing of\ngovernment for allowing itself to be influenced by these organisations so closely in\nthe first place. Thus, in the case of Tesco, whilst it may be fashionable to portray the\ncompany as chthonic [the devil-horned `o' and fork-tailed `y' on the cover of Simms\n(2007) Tescopoly epitomise this], its preeminence is also a function of the system in\nwhich it legitimately operates. One is reminded of Alan Bennett's assertion (2006,\npage vxi) that:\n``... the damage done out of conviction by self-confessed traitors like Burgess and\nBlunt does not compare with the far greater injuries done to this country by\npoliticians and higher civil servants out of cowardice, self-advancement and a\nneed to save their own skins.''\nNotwithstanding these comments, whilst Tesco retains such an edge in developing\nand implementing new policy initiatives that coalesce with the government agenda,\nsuch as healthy eating and urban regeneration, then we will see the company becoming\neven more centrally placed in the moves towards a capelocracy. Such situations suggest\nthat the relationship between big business and government is worthy of reassessment\nand reform. As Reich (2007, page 14) explains:\n``Companies are not citizens. They are bundles of contracts. The purpose of com-\npanies is to play the economic game as aggressively as possible. The challenge\nfor us as citizens is to stop them from setting the rules. Keeping supercapitalism\nfrom spilling over into democracy is the only constructive agenda for change.\nAll else ... is frolic and detour.''\nJohn Pal, Manchester Metropolitan University Business School\nDominic Medway, Manchester Business School\nReferences\nAmber T, Chittenden F, 2005,``Memorandum submitted to Select Committee'', European\nUnion, 19 July, http:\/\/www.publications.parliament.uk\/pa\/Id200506\/Idselect\/Ideucom\/33\/\n33we01.htm\nBennett A, 2006 Writing Home (Faber and Faber, London)\nFriends of the Earth, 2006 Calling the Shots: How Supermarkets Get TheirWay in Planning\nDecisions (Friends of the Earth, London)\nGuy C, 2007 Planning for Retail Development: ACritical View of the British Experience\n(Routledge, London)\nHawes D, 1993 Power on the Backbenches?
