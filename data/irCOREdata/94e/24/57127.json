The sequence 25 \nand structure of the Early Devonian Meall Fuar-mhonaidh Outlier, 32 km farther SW 26 \nalong the GGF, are also linked to this tectonic event, which was apparently localised 27 \nalong the main terrane-bounding faults in Scotland.  28 \n 29 \nEnd of Abstract 30 \n 31 \n The Great Glen Fault (GGF) is a major geological and topographical feature that 32 \ntransects the Highlands of Scotland, separating the Grampian Highlands to the southeast 33 \nfrom the Northern Highlands to the northwest. The fault passes offshore into the Moray 34 \nFirth (Fig. 1), where it forms a major sub-vertical structure (Andrews et al. 1990). The 35 \nfault can be traced for a further 23 kilometres northeast into the West Moray Firth Basin 36 \ninto deformed Mesozoic strata (Bird et al. 1987; Underhill 1991). The full role of the 37 \nGGF in the geological history and tectonic development of the Scottish Highlands 38 \nremains unclear, but it appears to have acted as a Neoproterozoic basin-bounding fault 39 \n(Banks & Winchester 2004) and has undoubtedly been the focus of significant sinistral 40 \nmovements during the Palaeozoic (Johnstone & Mykura, 1989; Stewart et al. 1999). 41 \nMinor sinistral, dextral and vertical movements followed in Mesozoic and Cenozoic 42 \ntimes (Rogers et al. 1989; Andrews et al. 1990; Underhill & Brodie, 1993; Roberts & 43 \nHoldsworth, 1999).  Exposure along the Great Glen is generally poor, but farther SW, 44 \nmylonites and blastomylonites attest to ductile shearing at mid-crustal levels (9-16 km) 45 \nwith later cataclasite, phyllonite and breccia development reflecting shallower level 46 \nbrittle movements (Stewart et al. 1999).  47 \n 48 \n The Rosemarkie and Cromarty inliers crop out adjacent to the GGF surrounded by 49 \nDevonian rocks (Fig. 1). The Rosemarkie Inlier, some 2 km wide and 9 km long, lies on 50 \nthe Black Isle adjacent to the GGF whose trace runs up to 500 m offshore (Fig. 2). It 51 \nexposes deformed amphibolite-facies psammites, subsidiary semipelites, amphibolitic 52 \nmafic bodies and laminated felsic and mafic gneisses, all cut by abundant, typically 53 \nsalmon pink, leucogranite veins and sheets (Rathbone & Harris 1980; Fletcher et al. 54 \n1996). Exposure is effectively limited to coastal outcrops (Fig. 3a), with a few weathered 55 \ninland outcrops. To the SW and NE the inlier is fault-bounded, but on its NW side mid-56 \nDevonian sandstones and conglomerates unconformably onlap the inlier. Palynological 57 \ndata from this Orcadian sequence show that its basal beds were deposited in the late 58 \nEifelian at c. 393 Ma (Marshall et al. 2007). The main psammitic and gneissose 59 \nlithologies are similar to those of the Neoproterozoic Moine succession and Archaean 60 \nLewisianoid inliers of the Northern Highlands respectively, but they differ considerably 61 \nfrom the nearest Moine rocks, Loch Eil Group psammites that crop out some 20 km to 62 \nthe NW. 63 \n The rocks of the inlier are widely altered, fractured and crushed with breccia and 64 \ngouge developed. The exception to this is a section below Learnie Farm between [NH 65 \n760 712] and [NH 767 620] where brittle deformation was limited and earlier ductile 66 \ndeformation structures are seen clearly. Here, Rathbone & Harris (1980) recognised four 67 \ndiscrete phases of ductile deformation with the leucogranites deformed by the latter three 68 \nphases. The majority of the leucogranite veins show clear evidence of intrusion at an 69 \nearly stage of the main deformation (D2) (Rathbone & Harris 1980). The deformation 70 \nphases in the inlier have been correlated with those of the Moine rocks and hence the 71 \nleucogranites were thought to be of Ordovician age or older (Rathbone 1980).  72 \n The inlier was exhumed after emplacement of the leucogranite veins but prior to 73 \ndeposition of the adjacent late Eifelian to Givetian sequence. To provide a lower age 74 \nconstraint on deformation and exhumation, samples of leucogranites were collected for 75 \nU-Pb isotopic dating. Samples of the adjacent gneisses were also taken to ascertain their 76 \nrelationship with the Lewisianoid gneisses that underlie the Moine Supergroup of the 77 \nNorthern Highlands. Stratigraphical units and related ages quoted in this paper are based 78 \non the current International Commission on Stratigraphy chart that largely follows 79 \nGradstein et al. (2004). 80 \n 81 \nTectonic Setting 82 \n Studies of the later stages of the Caledonian Orogeny in the Northern Highlands have 83 \nfocused on the formation of the Moine Thrust Zone at its western margin, and on the 84 \nuplift and intrusion history of its interior and its southeast side. The Moine Thrust Zone 85 \nwas active mainly during the Scandian event between c. 437 Ma and c. 430 Ma (Johnson 86 \net al. 1985; Dallmeyer et al. 2001; Goodenough et al. 2006) with later extensional 87 \nmovements continuing spasmodically to 408 Ma (Freeman et al. 1998). Dewey & 88 \nStrachan (2003) argued that Scandian deformation is absent from the Grampian 89 \nHighlands to the SE of the GGF, and hence postulated that at least 700 km of sinistral 90 \nmovement took place along the GGF between 425 Ma and 395 Ma. The waning phases 91 \nof the Caledonian Orogeny in the Northern Highlands were marked by intrusion of 92 \ngranitoid plutons coeval with regional uplift and significant lateral movements on the 93 \nmain NE-trending faults (Watson 1984). Documented examples include the Clunes 94 \nTonalite (428 \u00b1 2 Ma; Stewart et al. 2001) and the Strontian Pluton (425 \u00b1 3 Ma; Rogers 95 \n& Dunning, 1991), both linked to movements on the GGF (Hutton 1988), and the 96 \nRatagain Pluton (425 \u00b1 3 Ma; Rogers & Dunning 1991), linked to movements on the 97 \nStrathconon Fault (Hutton & McErlean 1991). 98 \n 99 \n The main development of the Acadian Orogeny lies in eastern North America where 100 \nAvalonia collided with Laurentia; the resultant deformation, metamorphism and related 101 \nigneous intrusion events lasted from 420 \u2013 395 Ma (Van Staal et al. 1998; Van Staal & 102 \nWhalen 2006; Zagorevski et al. 2007). In the British Isles the Acadian event resulted 103 \nfrom early collision of an Armorican microcontinent with the Avalonian part of 104 \nLaurussia at the northwest margin of the Rheic Ocean. The collision caused the Midland 105 \nplatform (microcraton) to indent the Welsh Basin and Late Palaeozoic basins of central 106 \nand northern England (Woodcock et al. 2007). Acadian deformation and related 107 \nmetamorphism occurred in the Lake District, Wales, and southern Britain between 400 108 \nand 390 Ma (Soper & Woodcock 2003; Sherlock et al. 2003). Acadian volcanic rocks 109 \nseem to be absent from the British Isles and \u2018Acadian\u2019 granites are restricted to the 110 \nSouthern Uplands and the Lake District. The nature of the Acadian event in Scotland is 111 \nequivocal, although structures in the Midland Valley, e.g. the Strathmore Syncline, have 112 \nbeen attributed to mid-Devonian (c. 400 Ma) sinistral transpression (Soper et al. 1992; 113 \nJones et al. 1997). 114 \n 115 \n In Baltica the Acadian event is absent and there is only evidence of an extended 116 \nhistory of Devonian uplift and exhumation of the Western Gneiss region of Norway 117 \n(Krabbendam & Dewey, 1998; Johnston et al. 2007; Walsh et al. 2007) and formation of 118 \nlarge sinistral transtensional basins (Osmundsen & Andersen, 2001; Eide et al. 2005). 119 \nUplift and extension here lasted from at least 410 Ma through to 370 Ma.  120 \n 121 \nThe lithology and structure of the Rosemarkie Inlier 122 \n Hugh Miller (in 1885) and John Horne (in 1890) mapped the Rosemarkie Inlier 123 \nduring the primary geological survey and brief descriptions of the lithologies and 124 \npetrography are given in the Geological Survey of Scotland Memoir for the area (Horne, 125 \n1923). Horne noted the distinctive character of the rocks and the abundance of alkali-126 \nfelspar-rich granitic material. He commented on their similarities to the Moine 127 \npsammites, but also speculated that the hornblendic felsic gneisses may equate to the 128 \n\u2018Lewisian floor\u2019 to the Moine succession (i.e. the Lewisianoid gneisses). He even 129 \nsuggested (p. 58) that the rocks may be a \u2018distinct group of Moine rocks brought up by 130 \nthe Great Glen Fault\u2019. Subsequently, P. A. Rathbone carried out detailed work on the 131 \ninlier as part of his Ph.D. (Rathbone 1980; Rathbone & Harris 1980) and A. J. Highton 132 \nremapped the southern part of the Rosemarkie Inlier and questioned the nature of the 133 \nprotolith of the felsic and mafic gneisses (Fletcher et al. 1996). Much of the structural 134 \ndata used here has been abstracted from Rathbone (1980). 135 \n 136 \nLithology 137 \n The Rosemarkie Inlier consists of grey, flaggy, typically thinly banded siliceous to 138 \nmicaceous psammites with subsidiary semipelites and pelites. Thin quartzofeldspathic 139 \nlenticles impart a weakly gneissose appearance to the rocks. The psammites are 140 \ninterleaved with laminated to thinly banded felsic and mafic gneisses on scales varying 141 \nfrom a few centimetres to ten of metres. The felsic gneisses consist essentially of quartz-142 \nplagioclase-biotite with variable hornblende content and are interlaminated with abundant 143 \namphibolitic mafic gneisses. Thicker amphibolitic mafic units and hornblendic ultramafic 144 \nlenses, locally with agmatitic net-veins, also occur within these gneisses, features 145 \ncharacteristic of the basement Lewisianoid inliers within the Moine succession. No 146 \nobvious shear zones or dislocations can be identified at psammite-gneiss contacts and in 147 \nplaces the distinction is quite cryptic. Discrete mafic amphibolite sheets and lenses are 148 \nalso common in the psammites, semipelites and the gneisses. These lithologies all contain 149 \na strong layer parallel fabric that is folded by F2, F3 and F4 folds. The rocks show 150 \nevidence of pervasive recrystallisation with quartz, feldspar, hornblende, biotite and 151 \nmuscovite defining a composite S1-S2 fabric. The metamorphic assemblages are 152 \ncharacteristic of lower amphibolite facies metamorphism although index minerals are 153 \nlargely absent and retrogression effects are widespread. Elongate garnet porphyroblasts 154 \nare developed in the pelitic units and deformed by the D2 crenulation fabric, whereas the 155 \nabundant small muscovite and shimmer aggregate porphyroblasts overprint the main S2 156 \nfoliation (Fletcher et al.1996). 157 \n 158 \n Pink to red, foliated and lineated leucogranite sheets, lenses and veins are diagnostic 159 \nof the Rosemarkie Inlier. The intrusions are typically 0.3 to 1 m wide but range from a 160 \nmillimetre up to 5 m in thickness. They are generally parallel sided and show sharp 161 \nplanar contacts with the country rocks (Fig. 3a), but some very thin veins do show 162 \ndiffuse margins. Although strongly deformed, the leucogranite veins are clearly 163 \ndiscordant to the host banding in numerous instances (Rathbone & Harris, 1980). 164 \nTypically, the angle of discordance is <5\u00b0 but locally high angles are seen. The granite is 165 \nvariable from fine-grained to coarse-grained and partly pegmatitic; in parts it contains 166 \npink potash feldspars, typically augened. Its mineralogy is essentially quartz, potash 167 \nfeldspar and plagioclase, with minor muscovite and biotite and accessory zircon, 168 \nmagnetite or ilmenite, and rare apatite, monazite and titanite.  Secondary chlorite (after 169 \nbiotite), zoisite, carbonate and rarely sodic amphibole are developed (Fletcher et al. 170 \n1996). In some areas white muscovite-bearing leucogranite sheets and veins intrude the 171 \nMoine psammites and semipelites; they show similar features to the pink veins. Although 172 \nmany of the leucogranite veins show evidence of strong deformation, others show 173 \ndeformation features, lower strains and mineralogies indicative of lower temperature and 174 \nbrittle shearing, suggesting they were emplaced at higher crustal levels.  175 \n 176 \nStructure 177 \n Rathbone & Harris (1980) recognised four deformation phases in the Rosemarkie 178 \nInlier. The planar fabrics parallel to the compositional banding and fine-scale 179 \ninterleaving of Moine psammites and Lewisianoid gneisses were attributed to the D1 180 \nevent. Tight to isoclinal minor folds are moderately abundant and are attributed to D2. A 181 \nrelated planar schistosity (S2) and associated lineation (L2) are pervasively developed. F3 182 \nopen to tight folds demonstrably refold the F2 folds and S2 fabrics and are abundant on a 183 \nsmall- and medium-scale. Their axes normally plunge moderately to the NE and verge 184 \ntowards the SE. However, Rathbone & Harris (1980) noted that F3 fold hinges are 185 \ncommonly curvilinear through up to 120\u00b0. Their axial planes are typically upright with an 186 \nS3 schistosity widely developed. D4 folds control much of the variation in strike and dip. 187 \nThey also plunge towards the northeast but their vergence is towards the northwest. Their 188 \naxial planes are generally upright, and only rarely is an associated cleavage developed. 189 \nF4-F3 and F3-F2 fold interference patterns are seen in the psammite-semipelite lithologies 190 \nand in the felsic and mafic gneisses. At [NH 765 615] interleaved Moine and 191 \nLewisianoid rocks are folded by a very tight metre-scale fold (F2) that is in turn refolded 192 \nby a D3 synform. The leucogranite veins contain a strong L-S fabric defined by strongly 193 \nattenuated quartz and feldspar with minor thin stringers of biotite and sparse muscovite 194 \ndevelopment. The lineation and foliation is contiguous with L2 and S2 in the adjacent 195 \nMoine and Lewisianoid rocks where it is defined by quartz, feldspar and in the mafic 196 \nrocks, hornblende alignment. L2 in the leucogranite is a millimetre-scale rodding of 197 \nquartz and pink feldspar; it locally dominates to give an L-tectonite. In places there are 198 \nspectacular F2-F3 interference folds involving the leucogranite veins (Fig. 3b).  Rathbone 199 \n& Harris (1980, Figure 4) documented examples of fold interference patterns involving 200 \nthe leucogranite veins and also showed that the prominent quartz lineation (L2) was 201 \nlocally modified by later D3 structures. 202 \n Fenitization, carbonate veining, brecciation and minor faulting dominate the southern 203 \nexposures in the Rosemarkie Inlier, but on the coastal section below Learnie Farm later 204 \nbrittle deformation effects are minimal. Here, the banding\/foliation strikes mainly 205 \nbetween northeast and north, dips range from vertical to moderately eastwards, and L2 206 \nplunges northeast at moderate angles (37\u00b0 to 050\u00b0) (Fig. 4). L2 is co-linear with the 207 \nmajority of the F2 and F3 axes, as indicated by the distribution of poles to 208 \nfoliation\/bedding.  209 \n 210 \nLeucogranite Textures 211 \n In thin section the foliated and lineated leucogranites from Learnie Shore are 212 \ndominated by quartz and feldspar \u2018ribbons\u2019, the latter being lenticular, typically 213 \nmeasuring 8 to 12 mm long and 0.3 mm to 1 mm wide in the S-L plane.  The potash and 214 \nplagioclase feldspars are disaggregated and fragmented with some sericitisation and new 215 \nquartz growth. In the quartz ribbons grain-size reduction has occurred giving rise to 216 \nrecrystallized aggregates 0.03 mm to 0.6 mm across, that exhibit tessellate grain 217 \nboundaries, strain shadows, fine inclusion trails and extensive sub-grain development. 218 \nSmall ragged\u2019 biotites, in part altered to chlorite, in parts form discontinuous trails 219 \nmarginal to the feldspar laminae. Ilmenite or magnetite form irregular altered aggregates 220 \nand may have released iron to give the prominent pink to red feldspar colouring. The 221 \n\u2018ribbons\u2019 have formed in response to the strong deformation with the elongate feldspars 222 \nnow effectively being porphyroclasts. Thin sections normal to the lineation show potash 223 \nfeldspar and plagioclase porphyroclasts commonly 3 to 4 mm across. They show strain 224 \ntwinning, embayed margins and locally marginal myrmekite development. The typical 225 \nporphyroclast size and dimensions of the ribbons suggest that the leucogranite was 226 \noriginally a medium- or even coarse-grained granite. The petrographic features in the 227 \nleucogranites are compatible with strong deformation under lower amphibolite-facies 228 \nconditions. As the lineation clearly defines the stretching direction (Ls), Rathbone (1980) 229 \nmeasured the shapes of the quartz aggregates in the deformed leucogranite using them to 230 \ndefine the principal planes of the strain ellipsoid. Taking the quartz as initially equant, a 231 \ncommon circumstance in granites, he obtained X:Y:Z values of 18:2.5:1. This strain is 232 \nprolate with a k value of 2.88 (Flinn 1962). 233 \n 234 \n In parts the leucogranite shows an augen texture with potash feldspars up to 1 cm 235 \nacross. Some appear to reflect relic feldspar crystals but other have grown during 236 \ndeformation and recrystallization. Although some augen show \u03b4 and \u03c3 tails that imply a 237 \nshear sense, many have a neutral geometry. M Stewart (pers. com. 2004) noted that the 238 \nshear sense was generally consistent within individual intrusions and in the pink 239 \nleucogranite sheets was generally sinistral. In contrast the white muscovite-bearing sheets 240 \ngenerally had internal and marginal fabrics implying a dextral shear sense. Stewart also 241 \nrecorded that there was evidence of later more brittle dextral shearing, generally focused 242 \nat the margins of the leucogranite veins and in the more pelitic units. This deformation 243 \nwas accompanied by extensive chlorite growth. 244 \n 245 \nCromarty Inlier 246 \n The Cromarty Inlier, measuring c. 9 km x 2.7 km, lies immediately northeast of the 247 \nRosemarkie Inlier, nestling against the GGF (Fig. 1), and is similarly onlapped by the 248 \nlate Eifelian sandstones and conglomerates. The inlier exposes variably siliceous to 249 \nmicaceous psammites with subsidiary semipelites, cut by garnet amphibolite bodies: the 250 \nmetasedimentary lithologies have been assigned to the Moine Supergroup (Rathbone & 251 \nHarris 1980). The pelitic units are garnetiferous and contain quartzofeldspathic 252 \nsegregations and white-mica aggregates with sparse relict fibrolite and more rarely 253 \nragged, strained kyanite blades (Rathbone & Harris 1980). Thin quartzofeldspathic veins 254 \nand porphyroblasts and segregations of pink feldspar are common and there is evidence 255 \nof in situ mobilisation of the psammites and semipelites. Several dyke-like masses of red 256 \npegmatitic granite of unknown age, some over 6 metre thick, cross cut the mafic and 257 \nmetasedimentary rocks.  258 \n The structures in the Cromarty Inlier correlate in part with those in the Rosemarkie 259 \nInlier. Rathbone & Harris (1980) reported that a single early planar fabric (S1-S2?) is 260 \nfolded by the dominant F3 folds. In the southern part of the inlier F3 axial planes are sub-261 \nvertical and first trend NE-SW but swing to E-W and then SE-NW at South Sutor stacks 262 \n(Fig.2). F3 axes similarly plunge gently NE and also swing to plunge moderately NW. In 263 \nthe northern part of the inlier F3 axial traces trend SE-NW and axial planes dip NE at c. 264 \n60\u00b0. F3 axes plunge gently to moderately both NW and SE. The folds have no consistent 265 \nvergence and as in the Rosemarkie Inlier, the F3 axes are curvilinear. F4 folds are 266 \ndeveloped on several scales; their axes plunge consistently NE and they have steeply 267 \ndipping axial planes. 268 \n 269 \nDevonian Rocks 270 \n At the southwest end of the Rosemarkie Inlier is a thin, wedge-shaped and fault-271 \nbounded sliver of early Devonian Lower Old Red Sandstone (ORS) rocks that is 272 \noverlapped to the west by mid-Devonian conglomerate (Fig. 2). The succession, termed 273 \nthe Den Siltstone Formation by Fletcher et al. (1996), consists of indurated breccio-274 \nconglomerates and chocolate brown to green-grey siltstones and silty sandstones. 275 \nLithologically, they are similar to Struie Group that crops out farther northwest (Trewin 276 \n& Thirlwall 2002). The rocks dip moderately to very steeply westwards, but are affected 277 \nby small-scale faulting with gouge commonly developed and sub-horizontal slickensides 278 \nlocally present. The bounding faults to this Lower ORS sequence extend into the 279 \noverlying mid-Devonian succession. 280 \n 281 \nThe Meall Fuar-mhonaidh Outlier 282 \n The Meall Fuar-mhonaidh Outlier exposes a c. 2 kilometre-thick sequence of Lower 283 \nORS sandstones and conglomerates and minor siltstones and mudstones (Fig. 5) (Mykura 284 \n& Owens 1983). The fault-bounded outlier measures 15 km long and c. 3 km wide and 285 \nlies adjacent to the GGF and Loch Ness, some 32 kilometres SW of the Rosemarkie 286 \nInlier (Fig.1). Mykura & Owens (1983) collected a siltstone sample from the Drumbuie 287 \nBurn by Drumnadrochit for palynological studies. This yielded fragmentary plant 288 \nmaterial and miospores indicating a late Emsian or early Eifelian age. The dominant 289 \nlithology is a red-brown to purple, micaceous sandstone with thin mudstone partings and 290 \nminor siltstone and conglomerate interbeds. Thick units of pink to red-brown, arkosic, 291 \ngritty, coarse-gained sandstone occur in the southern part of the outlier and around 292 \nUrquhart Castle (Fig. 5). Prominent lenticular units of poorly sorted and unbedded 293 \nconglomerate and breccio-conglomerate, 50m to 400m thick, interdigitate with the 294 \nsandstones. Moine psammites form most of the conglomerate clasts with subordinate 295 \nsemipelite, vein quartz, granite-gneiss, microgranite and some locally derived sandstone. 296 \nConglomerate-sandstone contacts are generally sharp and planar, but at [NN 4620 2215] 297 \na large \u2018flame\u2019 structure is developed; a 3-4m wide septum of steeply dipping silty 298 \nsandstone penetrates the overlying conglomerate for some 50 metres.  299 \n 300 \n At the northeast end of the outlier near the top of the succession lies the Creag Nay 301 \nConglomerate, a highly lensoid, clast-supported, breccio-conglomerate unit, bounded on 302 \nits eastern side by a steep fault. It consists of large angular clasts of psammite and pink to 303 \norange leucogranite in a coarse-grained sandstone matrix. Mykura & Owens (1983) 304 \ninterpreted the unit as the product of a proximal debris flow derived from the east. 305 \n 306 \n The Meall Fuar-mhonaidh sequence is folded into a broad syncline with minor folds 307 \nand steeper dips developed in the southeast part of the outlier closer to the GGF (Fig. 4). 308 \nMinor fold axes typically plunge gently to the E and NE or to the W and SW. Cross-309 \nsection restorations show that overall shortening across the outlier totals some 25%. At 310 \nthe southern end of the outlier Mykura & Owens (1983) recorded that the Devonian 311 \nrocks have been thrust and faulted against brecciated and cataclastic Moine psammites. 312 \nAt NH 449 188 shattered pebbly sandstones are separated from the underlying Moine 313 \npsammites by a mylonite zone that dips c. 25\u00b0 SE. Mykura & Owens (1983) also 314 \npostulate a thrust at the Devonian-Moine boundary immediately north of Loch 315 \na\u2019Bhealaich to explain its sinuous nature and the steep dips in the overlying 316 \nconglomerates and sandstones. The northwestern boundary of the outlier is unexposed 317 \nbut its overall orientation suggests that it is a steeply dipping NE-trending fault. Faults in 318 \nthe outlier generally trend north and NE and postdate the folding and thrusting. 319 \n 320 \n The succession preserved in the Meall Fuar-mhonaidh Outlier represents a fluviatile 321 \nand lacustrine sequence, rapidly deposited in late Emsian times in a restricted rift basin 322 \nwith marginal alluvial fans (Mykura & Owens 1983). Contractional deformation linked 323 \nto movements along the GGF may have overlapped the later stages of sedimentation, and 324 \nsubsequently generated folding, localised thrusting, and faulting in the outlier. The 325 \nstructural pattern is compatible with a positive flower structure linked to sinistral 326 \ntranspression along the GGF.  327 \n 328 \nGeochronology 329 \nPrevious studies 330 \n Rathbone (1980) reported strongly discordant zircon U-Pb data defining a chord with 331 \na lower intercept at 384 Ma from a leucogranite vein below Learnie [NH 766 618]. The 332 \nbulk zircon fractions were analysed by R.A. Cliff at Leeds University and consisted of 333 \nold grains, neocrystalline grains, and composite grain cores and rims.  The data were 334 \nobtained when zircons were not processed to reduce the effects of lead loss, and hence 335 \nthis age likely underestimated the true age of new zircon growth.  The leucogranites were 336 \ninterpreted as deformed by a D2 event that was correlated directly with the deformation 337 \nsequence seen in the Moine succession. Hence, as the rocks were altered and lay adjacent 338 \nto the GGF the lower intercept age was discounted as due to subsequent leaching and 339 \nconsequent lead loss. 340 \n 341 \nSampling and analytical techniques 342 \n For this study four samples of leucogranite and two of adjacent thinly banded 343 \nhornblendic felsic gneisses were collected from the shore section below Learnie Farm 344 \n(Figure 3a). Zircon and monazite were recovered from the c. 3 kg samples using standard 345 \ncrushing, heavy liquid and isodynamic magnetic separation techniques.  Zircons from 346 \ntwo leucogranite samples were not analysed as the grains proved insufficiently robust to 347 \nsurvive either air or chemical abrasion due to abundant cracks and probable high U 348 \ncontents. Sample location grid references are given in Tables 1 and 2.  349 \n 350 \n Mineral grains selected for TIMS analysis and zircons for LA-MC-ICP-MS analysis 351 \nwere hand-picked under ethanol and only the highest quality crack-free grains were 352 \nchosen.  Cathodoluminescence images of the main types of zircon grains in the 353 \nleucogranite and gneisses are shown in Fig. 6. Zircons selected for TIMS analysis were 354 \nabraded following Krogh (1982) to reduce Pb loss.  All minerals selected for TIMS 355 \nanalysis were washed in distilled 2N HNO3 at c. 60\u00ba C and ultra-pure water, spiked with 356 \na 205Pb\/235U tracer and dissolved in ultra-pure acids, and processed through chemistry 357 \nfollowing Krogh (1973) with modifications as described by Corfu & Noble (1992).  Data 358 \nwere mainly obtained on a VG 354 mass spectrometer fitted with an ion-counting Daly 359 \ndetector, with some data obtained on a Triton mass spectrometer using an ion-counting 360 \nsecondary electron multiplier.  Procedural blanks were <10 pg and <0.1 pg for Pb and U, 361 \nrespectively.  Raw data were reduced using PbDat (Ludwig 1993).  The common Pb 362 \nisotope composition used in data reduction was estimated using the two-stage model of 363 \nStacey & Kramers (1975). 364 \n 365 \n Zircons from the samples GX 1732 and 1737 were selected for analysis by LA-MC-366 \nICP-MS and subjected to chemical abrasion (CA) following Mattinson (2005), as this has 367 \nbeen shown to improve concordance of the ablated minerals (M. Horstwood. pers. comm. 368 \n2006).  The grains were annealed at 900 \u00baC for 60 hrs and then leached at 180 \u00ba C in 29M 369 \nHF for 10 hrs to remove domains that could contribute to Pb loss.  Zircons from sample 370 \nGX1732 were not significantly affected; whereas some GX1737 grains were reduced in 371 \nvolume by up to c. 30% (see Fig. 6 e).  The zircons were then mounted in 25 mm 372 \ndiameter epoxy resin discs and polished to remove c. 40% of the grain thicknesses to 373 \nyield cross sections.  Grains were imaged in backscatter electron (BSE) and 374 \ncathodoluminescence (CL) modes using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) to 375 \nexamine the zircon internal zonation, thus allowing selection of appropriate areas for 376 \nlaser ablation analysis.  Data were obtained on a Nu HR MC-ICP-MS using analytical 377 \nprotocols based on Horstwood et al. (2003).  Raw data were reduced using an in-house 378 \nExcel spreadsheet.  TIMS and MC-ICP-MS reduced data were plotted using Isoplot 379 \n(Ludwig 2003).  Sample information and U-Pb data are summarized in Tables 1 and 2, 380 \nand plotted on Figure 7.  TIMS errors in the data tables and plotted on concordia 381 \ndiagrams are quoted at the 2\u03c3 level. 382 \n 383 \nResults 384 \n Two distinctive zircon morphologies were recognised in the leucogranites. Stubby, 385 \ninternally complex-zoned, faceted to rounded, partly resorbed zircons were the most 386 \nabundant type, but well-faceted, acicular zircons were also present (see Fig. 6). Titanite 387 \nwas the principal secondary U-bearing accessory phase in the leucogranites, except in 388 \nGX 1734 where monazite was present. 389 \n 390 \n The acicular zircons typically have large aspect ratios, up to 10:1, and show strong 391 \noscillatory compositional zoning, visible both under the binocular microscope and by CL 392 \n(Fig. 6a). Cores occur in all but the smallest acicular grains. U contents in the acicular 393 \nzircons are relatively high (c. 700 ppm, Table 1) with the highest U-zones (grey low CL 394 \nareas - Fig. 6a) occurring at the grain tips. Multi-grain fractions of acicular zircons from 395 \nsample GX 1731 were selected for analysis by TIMS to constrain the emplacement age 396 \nof the leucogranites. Each fraction comprised abraded small grains, <50 \u03bcm long, 397 \nexhibiting only simple oscillatory zoning.  Given their small size and delicate elongate 398 \nform, the grains were only lightly abraded, making total elimination of Pb-loss difficult. 399 \nAdditional analyses using CA-TIMS were not pursued as the high-U domains that best 400 \nrepresent new zircon growth during leucogranite emplacement and crystallization would 401 \nhave been removed during the preliminary leaching steps. 402 \n 403 \n Monazite was found only in leucogranite sample, GX 1734, where it forms sharply 404 \nfaceted greenish-yellow euhedral crystals and crystal fragments up to 100 \u03bcm long.  Fe-405 \noxide inclusions are common in most of the monazite grains but only inclusion-free 406 \ncrystals were selected for analysis.  This high quality monazite is considered to be the 407 \nmost reliable and preferred mineral for dating the leucogranite crystallization at 408 \nRosemarkie. Although zircon is abundant in the leucogranites, its near ubiquitous 409 \ninheritance is a serious impediment to achieving concordant TIMS ages. A similar 410 \nproblem has previously been noted in Himalayan leucogranites (e.g. Noble & Searle 411 \n1995).  412 \n 413 \n One acicular zircon fraction from sample GX 1731 is reversely discordant but 414 \noverlaps the concordia curve, yielding a concordia age (Ludwig 2003) of 400.8 \u00b1 2.6 Ma 415 \n(Fig. 7a).  The second zircon fraction is normally discordant and slightly younger than 416 \n400 Ma.  Its position on the concordia plot is consistent with Pb-loss coupled with a 417 \nsmall amount of inherited older zircon present. 418 \n 419 \n The monazite data are slightly reversely discordant, which results from excess 206Pb, 420 \nas is normally found in pristine monazite that does not show Pb-loss (Sch\u00e4rer 1984).  The 421 \ndata spread along concordia but all four analyses overlap within error.  The 422 \ncrystallization age is best constrained by the average monazite 207Pb\/235U age of 397.6 \u00b1 423 \n2.2 Ma based on all of the data (MSWD = 1.4). This age is consistent with the concordia 424 \nage obtained from the GX 1731 acicular zircons. 425 \n 426 \n The more equant, multi-faceted zircons from sample GX 1731 and zircons with 427 \nsimilar morphology from the gneisses GX 1732 and 1737 share the same general internal 428 \ncompositional zoning characteristics, as revealed by CL imaging.  Normal igneous 429 \noscillatory zoning is absent and most grains show broad bands of contrasting 430 \nluminescence (e.g. Fig. 6b, c).  Some internal zones have boundaries that suggest original 431 \ncrystal faces and resorption features (Fig. 6b, c) or vague primary compositional zoning 432 \n(Fig. 6c).  However, for the most part the textures indicate complete internal 433 \nrecrystallization with weak sector (e.g. Fig. 6d) or chaotic zoning (e.g. Fig. 6e) being the 434 \nmost pronounced features.  Sample GX 1737 also has a number of intergrown and 435 \ncompletely recrystallized zircons (Fig. 6f). These textures are characteristic of rocks 436 \nknown to have been metamorphosed under granulite-facies conditions (Corfu et al. 437 \n2003), attesting to a high-grade metamorphic history for the Rosemarkie gneisses.  438 \nSimilar textures have been noted in zircons from the high-metamorphic grade gneisses 439 \nfrom the mainland and offshore Lewisian Gneiss Complex (Corfu et al. 1998; 440 \nWhitehouse & Bridgwater 2001; Love et al. 2004). 441 \n 442 \n LA-MC-ICP-MS data from these complex zoned zircons are listed in Table 2 and 443 \nsummarized in Figure 7b.  Data were obtained from the cores of the zircons, and in 444 \ngeneral only a single compositional zone was sampled. In a few instances the pit (c. 25 445 \n\u03bcm diameter) did sample across several compositional zones but there was no significant 446 \ndifference in isotope ratio or calculated age.  Three main observations can be drawn from 447 \nthe data: sample GX 1732 is an Archaean gneiss; sample GX 1737 contains Archaean 448 \nzircons that are distinctly younger than those in GX 1732; sample GX 1737 experienced 449 \nnew zircon growth or complete metamorphic resetting during the Palaeoproterozoic. 450 \n 451 \n Zircon analyses from sample GX 1732 plot mainly as concordant to reversely 452 \ndiscordant, giving ages between 2932 \u00b1 8 Ma and 2808 \u00b1 9 Ma.  The older concordant 453 \nanalyses are from grains with central regions preserving vestiges of oscillatory zoning 454 \nwithin euhedral grain outlines, surrounded by the broad banding.  The younger 455 \nconcordant analyses are from zircons with broad sector and fir-tree zonation or from 456 \ngrains with roughly homogeneous and low CL.  This age pattern suggests that the gneiss 457 \nformed either from an igneous protolith emplaced at c. 2900 Ma with subsequent 458 \nmetamorphism, or at c. 2800 Ma under high-grade metamorphic conditions with c. 2900 459 \nMa inheritance. The age of granulite-facies metamorphism certainly extended to c. 2800 460 \nMa, by which time many of the zircons had undergone significant recrystallization.  461 \n The reversely discordant GX 1732 grains have similar 207Pb\/206Pb ages to the 462 \nconcordant grains, and correlate with ablations from low CL regions dominated by broad 463 \nsector or chaotic zoning.  In contrast, the normally discordant data do not correlate with a 464 \nparticular CL texture. These zircon data form an array consistent with the main period of 465 \nPb-loss occurring between 0 Ma and 400 Ma, and do not show evidence of Proterozoic 466 \nPb-loss (see Fig. 7b). 467 \n 468 \n Sample GX 1737 has Archaean zircons that show the affects of significant Pb-loss or 469 \nnew zircon growth in the Palaeoproterozoic.  Unlike GX 1732, none of the Archaean 470 \nzircons in this rock show reverse discordance.  Concordia ages range from 2781 \u00b1 13 Ma 471 \nto 2719 \u00b1 10 Ma, indicating a younger protolith age than GX 1732.  The discordant, 472 \nlargely Archaean grains fall in an array towards ~1750 Ma (Fig. 7b).  A second Pb-loss 473 \narray is outlined by concordant to moderately discordant analyses.  A regression through 474 \nthese data (see Table 2) yields an upper intercept age of 1746 \u00b1 31 Ma with a lower 475 \nintercept anchored at the GX 1734 monazite age of 398 Ma (MSWD = 2.6).  An 476 \nunconstrained regression yields intercepts of 1740 \u00b1 16 Ma and 233 +140\/-150 Ma 477 \n(MSWD = 2.0).  The data and CL textures are consistent with the gneiss being generated 478 \nfrom an Archaean protolith and metamorphosed under granulite- or upper amphibolite-479 \nfacies conditions between c. 2780 and 2720 Ma, followed by further upper amphibolite-480 \nfacies metamorphism during pervasive Laxfordian reworking at c. 1745 Ma.   481 \n 482 \n Finally, the cores of a few rounded zircons from sample GX 1731 were analysed by 483 \nLA-MC-ICP-MS merely to determine the nature of inheritance in the leucogranite. Both 484 \nArchaean age and ca. 1700 Ma grains were observed, consistent with their derivation 485 \nfrom the adjacent Proterozoic-Archaean gneisses of the inlier. 486 \n 487 \nImplications of Dating 488 \n The zircon U-Pb data from the two felsic and mafic gneisses sampled in the 489 \nRosemarkie Inlier clearly show their Lewisianoid affinity. Protolith ages for GX 1732 490 \nrange from c. 2930 Ma to 2810 Ma, with evidence of a granulite- or upper amphibolite-491 \nfacies metamorphic overprint at c. 2810 Ma. GX 1737 shows younger protolith ages 492 \nbetween 2780 Ma and 2720 Ma with evidence of Laxfordian recrystallisation at c. 1745 493 \nMa. Friend et al. (2008) presented similar Archaean ages for the Borgie, Farr and Ribigill 494 \nLewisianoid inliers of north Sutherland. The variability of ages shown by the Rosemarkie 495 \nsamples is surprising given their proximity. It suggests the inlier contains structurally 496 \ninterleaved slivers that represent different parts of the Lewisianoid basement to the 497 \nMoine succession. Interleaving of Moine and Lewisianoid rocks occurred prior to 498 \nemplacement of the leucogranites and the subsequent \u2018D2\u2019 event. The planar nature of the 499 \nfabric and basement-cover contacts and lack of small- or medium-scale F1 folding 500 \nsuggests that this interleaving represents part of a \u2018D1\u2019 ductile shear zone (see Harris, 501 \n1978). 502 \n 503 \n The U-Pb TIMS zircon and monazite ages of 401 Ma and 398 Ma respectively 504 \nobtained from the two leucogranite samples date their emplacement as late Emsian. 505 \nTaking an average value of 399 Ma for leucogranite vein intrusion, and given that the 506 \ninlier was unconformably overlain by conglomerate and sandstones by late Eifelian times 507 \nat c. 393 Ma (Marshall et al. 2007), exhumation of the inlier and related deformation are 508 \nrestricted to some 6 million years. Leucogranite deformation textures, metamorphic 509 \nassemblages in the Moine pelitic rocks, and the fabrics and fold geometries now exposed 510 \nare all indicative of mid-crustal levels. Hence, c. 12-15 km uplift apparently occurred in a 511 \nmaximum time frame of 6 Ma. However, given that this period included planation of the 512 \ntopography and generation of the overlying erosional surface, 4 to 5 million years would 513 \nbe a more realistic estimate. Implied exhumation rates for the Rosemarkie Inlier thus 514 \nrange from 2 mm\/year to about 4 mm \/year. The early Devonian Lower ORS succession 515 \nis present on the NW side of the GGF but absent from its immediate SE side except 516 \noffshore. However, outliers of Lower ORS rocks are present farther east in the Grampian 517 \nHighlands and there is little apparent difference in topographical level of the basal 518 \nunconformity across the GGF. Hence the Rosemarkie Inlier has apparently behaved as an 519 \nextruded, constricted, elongate \u2018pip\u2019 linked to sinistral transcurrent movements on the 520 \nGGF. 521 \n 522 \n We now review the available structural and strain data and the regional structure to 523 \ntry and explain the evolution of the Rosemarkie Inlier, particularly with respect to the 524 \nhistory of the adjacent GGF. 525 \n 526 \nStructural Model 527 \n The local structure of the Learnie shore section is described above and the foliation 528 \nand lineation orientations shown in Fig. 4. The foliations strike NE, orientated some 8\u00b0 529 \nclockwise of the trend of the GGF, and dip moderately to steeply NW. The only 530 \nmeasured strain values from the inlier indicate a strongly constrictional strain (Rathbone 531 \n1980) with a k value of 2.88. This obliquity of foliation, NE-plunging stretching 532 \nlineation, and related D2-D4 prolate strain, suggest a strong component of transpression 533 \nor transtension (e.g. Sanderson & Marchini, 1984; Dewey et al. 1998; Fossen & Tikoff, 534 \n1998). Given the proximity of the GGF and localised nature of the uplift this seems a 535 \nlikely circumstance. Oblate to plane strains are more generally characteristic of 536 \ntranspression, whereas prolate to plane strains are more typically developed in 537 \ntranstension (Tikoff & Teyssier 1994; Jones et al. 2004). Although both types of 538 \ndeformation can give rise to steeply dipping fabrics, they are more commonly developed 539 \nin transpression. Steeply dipping lineations generally form during transpression, whereas 540 \nshallow dipping, commonly horizontal lineations are typical of most transtensional 541 \nsituations (see Fossen & Tikoff, 1998; Krabbendam & Dewey, 1998). In the Rosemarkie 542 \nInlier the steeply dipping foliation, moderately dipping lineation (37\u00b0 to 050\u00b0), and 543 \ndocumented rapid uplift are compatible with transpression but not with transtension. The 544 \nboundary conditions in effect require that the inlier is extruded, an unreasonable 545 \ncircumstance for a regional strain field, but plausible in small domains. It is proposed that 546 \nthe inlier formed at a restraining bend of the GGF due to a fault step-over to the NW that 547 \ndeveloped in mid-Devonian times. The fault geometry and the internal structure of the 548 \ninlier indicate that transpressional uplift accompanied significant sinistral lateral 549 \nmovements on the GGF.  550 \n 551 \n Theoretical transpressional deformation models and field examples on several scales 552 \nhave been amply documented (e.g. Robin & Cruden 1994; Lin et al. 1998; Jones et al. 553 \n2004). Although specific cases can be modelled, most authors have found it difficult to 554 \ndescribe the transpressional deformation fully, even in specific well-documented 555 \ngeological examples. The variations in boundary conditions, convergence angles, 556 \nvorticity, strain and fabric development, strain rates, and the common occurrence of 557 \nstrain partitioning, all impose limits on the accuracy of the model (Robin & Cruden 558 \n1994; Jones & Tanner 1995; Lin et al. 1998). In the Rosemarkie Inlier the bounding 559 \nfaults are either unexposed or have been reactivated subsequent to mid-Devonian 560 \ndeformation and uplift; brittle deformation effects and alteration affect much of the 561 \nexposed section. However, the structural geometry, strong prolate strain, and poorly 562 \ndeveloped and apparently contradictory kinematic indicators seen in the Learnie shore 563 \nsection do constrain the possible transpressional models. Tikoff & Fossen (1999) 564 \nprovided 12 reference 3-D deformation models applicable to thrust and 565 \ntranspressional\/transtensional deformation. The Rosemarkie deformation features and 566 \nprolate strain fit well in the widening shear or widening\/shortening shear categories, 567 \ndominated by vertical or possibly oblique extrusion. Robin & Cruden (1994) described 568 \ntranspressional shear zones from Canada and Sweden and derived dynamic theoretical 569 \nmodels of the stress and strain distribution in a vertical transpression zones. Again, the 570 \nRosemarkie Inlier would fit well as a sinistral transpressive zone with a strong \u2018Press\u2019 571 \n(i.e. vertical or steep extrusion) component. One is left to speculate as to whether the 572 \ninlier was extruded with fixed bounding faults or became thinner as extrusion occurred. 573 \nOblique transpression models introduce further complications, particularly with regard to 574 \nstrain and vorticity variations, both across the zone and at different vertical levels (see 575 \nRobin & Cruden 1994, Figure 12).   576 \n 577 \n Searle et al. (1998) documented transpressional tectonics along the dextral 578 \nKarakoram Fault Zone in Ladakh where a fault splay gives rise to a restraining bend. The 579 \nresulting inlier (the Pangong Range), which consists of Cretaceous-age migmatitic and 580 \nhigh-grade metamorphic ortho- and paragneisses (Searle et al. 2010), was exhumed 581 \nbetween 18 and 11 Ma. Leucogranite bodies (Tangtse Granite) were intruded at the start 582 \nof transpression and show S-C fabrics and a prominent lineation that plunges 20\u00b0 to the 583 \nNW. Searle et al. (1998) used the offset of geological features and the lineation 584 \norientation to conclude that lateral slip totalled 56 km and vertical exhumation some 20 585 \nkm during this c. 7 Ma Miocene event, giving average lateral slip rates of 8.3 mm\/year 586 \nand vertical uplift rates of 3.0 mm\/year.  587 \n If we take the strain values obtained by Rathbone (1980) as representative of the 588 \ndeformation during transpressional uplift of the Rosemarkie Inlier, then we can obtain a 589 \ncrude estimate of the amounts of uplift and lateral movement. We must assume that:  590 \ni) the strongly deformed leucogranites were emplaced at the start of 591 \ndeformation, as suggested by the field relationships 592 \nii) the strain is representative of the inlier as a whole,  593 \niii) the inlier is 2 km wide.  594 \n Approximating the inlier as a simple prolate ellipsoid and restoring it to an unstrained 595 \nstate (Fig 8) implies uplift of c. 15 km and sinistral displacement of c. 29 km. Despite the 596 \nadmitted simplicity of the assumptions (see above), these values are of a sensible order 597 \nand compatible with the structural and metamorphic state at the current level of outcrop. 598 \nThey fit with the structural and geochronological evidence that the Rosemarkie Inlier was 599 \nextruded obliquely as a rising but deforming body (elongate \u2018pip\u2019) coeval with a short-600 \nlived (4 to 6 Ma) mid-Devonian transpressional event. Lateral slip rates of 4.8 \u2013 7.25 601 \nmm\/year and vertical uplift rates of 2.3 \u2013 3.65 mm\/year are implied. These rates are of 602 \nthe same order as those reported from the Yammouneh and related faults in the Lebanon 603 \n(Gomez et al. 2007; Butler et al. 1998), but less that those reported from major plate-604 \nbounding strike-slip fault zones such as the Alpine Fault in New Zealand (Walcott, 1998) 605 \nor the Karakoram Fault (see above).  606 \n The Cromarty Inlier possibly represents a further \u2018pip\u2019 that was exhumed from 607 \nsomewhat shallower crustal levels, implying that the restraining bend developed on the 608 \nGGF but was partitioned into blocks by linking faults, perhaps indicating that step-overs 609 \ndeveloped sequentially to the northeast as sinistral movements occurred. Similarly the 610 \nfault-bounded sliver of Lower ORS rocks that lies adjacent to the Precambrian rocks of 611 \nthe Rosemarkie Inlier on its southwestern side (Fig. 2.) appears to represent only limited 612 \nuplift during transpression.  613 \n 614 \nDiscussion 615 \nTectonic Implications 616 \n Transpressional uplifts are a well-documented phenomenon linked to restraining 617 \nbends in strike-slip fault zones. The Rosemarkie Inlier is a good small-scale example of a 618 \nsharp restraining bend within a cratonic strike-slip fault system based on older crustal 619 \nfaults and removed from active plate boundaries. Mann (2007) provided an extensive 620 \noverview and classification of restraining- and releasing bends related to active and 621 \nancient strike-slip fault systems. He noted that the bends act as \u2018concentrators\u2019 of 622 \nintraplate stresses and the related uplifts affect relatively small rhomboidal step-over 623 \nareas. Such bends are typically short-lived as they are bypassed by subsequent faulting or 624 \nbecome extinct with continuing lateral movement. Examples of small-scale focused uplift 625 \nhave been reported from the San Gabriel Mountains adjacent to the San Andreas Fault 626 \n(Buscher & Spotila 2007), and from the Ocotillo Badlands (8 km x 2 km step-over) along 627 \nthe active Coyote Fault in Southern California (Segall & Pollard, 1980). In contrast, Paul 628 \net al. (1999) described a c. 500 Ma example from the northern Flinders Ranges (South 629 \nAustralia) where localised sinistral transpressional uplift occurred during the Delamerian 630 \nOrogeny.  Uplift was accompanied by very high heat flows with the exhumed 631 \nmetamorphosed basement rock assemblages implying that temperatures of 500-550\u00b0C 632 \nwere attained at depths of c. 10 km. 633 \n 634 \nLate Silurian \u2013 Mid-Devonian evolution of the Great Glen Fault (GGF) 635 \n As noted above the GGF has had a lengthy history of movement dominated in 636 \nSilurian and Devonian times by sinistral lateral displacements. Most authors favour at 637 \nleast 200 kilometres of late Silurian sinistral movement based on the offset of Caledonian 638 \nregional tectonic features (e.g. Dewey & Strachan, 2003) and prominent geophysical 639 \nreflectors in the upper mantle lithosphere (Hall et al. 1984; Snyder & Flack 1990). The 640 \nGGF appears to have acted as a near planar sub-vertical structure from Neoproterozoic to 641 \nearly Devonian times (see Stewart et al. 1999, 2001), but its subsequent geometry in the 642 \nMoray Firth area is more complex. The Rosemarkie Inlier lacks evidence of linear or 643 \nplanar fabrics formed during the late Silurian sinistral movements along the GGF at c. 644 \n425 Ma. The planar fabrics that predate the leucogranite sheets and veins lie near parallel 645 \nto bedding and relate to the earlier interleaving of Moine and Lewisianoid rocks. Hence, 646 \nthe formation of the restraining bend, related step-overs and main structures in the inlier 647 \nare mid-Devonian in age. So why did the geometry of the GGF change at this time?  648 \n 649 \n Watson (1984) estimated that regional uplift of the Inverness area totalled some 10-650 \n15 km during the late Silurian-early Devonian period. The bulk of uplift was completed 651 \nprior to deposition of the Lower ORS lacustrine and fluvial sandstone, siltstone and 652 \nconglomerate succession that commenced in the Emsian at c.407 Ma. Thick bituminous 653 \nmudstone, siltstone and impure limestone units are developed both in the Beauly- 654 \nStrathpeffer area (Mykura & Owens 1983), NW of the GGF, and also beneath the 655 \nMesozoic units of the Inner Moray Firth, SE of the GGF (Marshall & Hewett 2003). 656 \nThese lacustrine rocks form part of the Struie Formation and attain over 1000m in 657 \nthickness. The Lower ORS facies distribution and sedimentology define a pattern of 658 \nrestricted fault-controlled basins with proximal infill marking a period of extension 659 \n(Trewin & Thirlwall 2002; Marshall & Hewett 2003). Possibly the GGF was reactivated 660 \nin transtension at this time (Dewey & Strachan, 2003). During end Caledonian uplift and 661 \nextension new faults were formed and the structural template was changed. Hence, when 662 \nsinistral transpression occurred in the mid-Devonian as a result of a northward directed 663 \ncompressive \u2018pulse\u2019, lateral movement stepped northwest. This short-lived deformation 664 \nevent (399-393 Ma) signalled a marked change in the applied stress direction, apparently 665 \nfocused on the GGF and in the adjacent early Devonian basins where localised thrusting, 666 \nfolding and faulting occurred.  667 \n 668 \nLate Palaeozoic \u2013 Mesozoic evolution of the Great Glen Fault (GGF)  669 \n Underhill & Brodie (1993) evaluated the structural geology of Easter Ross and the 670 \nMoray Firth basin and described a sequence of NNE-trending folds and faults lying NW 671 \nof the GGF trace in Middle and Upper ORS rocks around Tain. They concluded that the 672 \nstructures, developed during Permo-Carboniferous inversion, reflected major faults in the 673 \nunderlying early Devonian and older rocks. Limited dextral movements occurred on the 674 \nadjacent GGF. However, the main offshore extension of the GGF was inactive during 675 \nwidespread extension in the Permo-Triassic and Jurassic and the fault zone was only 676 \nreactivated as part of a transtensional flower structure in the late Cretaceous or early 677 \nCainozoic. Fault movements from Jurassic times onward were focused at the margins of 678 \nthe Moray Firth Basin (Andrews et al. 1990). Bird et al. (1987) showed that during the 679 \nMesozoic lateral movements transferred to the northwest onto the Helmsdale Fault giving 680 \nrise on the Sutherland Terrace to localised extensional deformation during sinistral 681 \nmovements, and inversion and localised compression during dextral movements. This 682 \nmigration of movement resulted in formation of a series of step-overs linked in the 683 \nMesozoic sequences by moderate to gently dipping thrusts or extensional faults.  Hence, 684 \nthe onshore and offshore record shows that strike-slip movements migrated 685 \nnorthwestwards onto parallel faults with their timing dependent on the regional plate 686 \ntectonic geometry and the prevailing stress orientations (Underhill & Brodie, 1993). The 687 \nnortheast extension of the GGF into the Moray Firth Basin was locked for much of the 688 \nLate Palaeozoic and Mesozoic. Underhill and Brodie (1993) concluded that because the 689 \nGGF was a vertical structure and lay orthogonal to the northwest-southeast extensional 690 \nstrain field, strike-slip reactivation only occurred when extensional slip vectors changed 691 \nto become near-parallel to the fault., i.e. in the Permo-Carboniferous and Cainozoic. 692 \nThus, the mid-Devonian transpressional event marked a major change in the pattern of 693 \nmovement on the GGF, with the locus of fault movement migrating progressively 694 \nnorthwest; this pattern continued into Mesozoic times with lateral and vertical 695 \nmovements becoming focused on the Helmsdale Fault (Roberts & Holdsworth 1999).  696 \n 697 \nThe generation of the Rosemarkie Inlier  698 \n It is proposed that the Rosemarkie Inlier was generated by oblique extrusion at a 699 \nsharp restraining bend developed on the GGF between about 399 Ma and 393 Ma. The 700 \nformation of the step-over reflected the regional stress conditions that prevailed during 701 \nthis sinistral transpressional event, the increased frictional resistance to renewed 702 \nmovement along the pre-existing GGF trace, and the newly formed structural template. 703 \nThis short-lived mid-Devonian transpressional event marked the end of late Caledonian 704 \nuplift, extension and sinistral transtension in the late Silurian and early Devonian (see 705 \nDewey and Strachan 2003). The event was coeval with the Acadian compressional event 706 \nthat is widely developed in England and Wales (Woodcock & Soper 2006; Woodcock et 707 \nal. 2007) and even recorded in western Ireland (Meere & Mulchrone 2006). In contrast, 708 \nin West Norway and possibly also in Shetland there is evidence of widespread extension, 709 \ntranstension, and strike-slip fault movements during this period, which was dominated by 710 \nthe uplift and erosion of the emerging Caledonide chain (Krabbendam & Dewey 1998; 711 \nWalsh et al. 2007; Fossen, 2010). Although the Acadian event resulted from the onset of 712 \ncollisional activity in the developing Rheic Ocean south of Avalonia we argue below that 713 \nit also affected Scotland giving rise to localised sinistral transpression focused along the 714 \nmain terrane-bounding faults and extending as far north as the Moray Firth. 715 \n 716 \n 717 \nThe nature of the Acadian Event in Scotland 718 \n The Devonian succession in Scotland contains evidence of periods of uplift and 719 \npossible tectonic activity that separate it into three distinct sequences. These were termed 720 \nthe Lower, Middle and Upper Old Red Sandstone (ORS) by Murchison (1859) and the 721 \nterms are still in use today, albeit with considerably modifications (see Trewin & 722 \nThirlwall 2002). 723 \n 724 \nMidland Valley 725 \n The Midland Valley terrane is separated from the Highlands on its northwest side by 726 \nthe Highland Boundary Fault Zone (HBFZ) and from the Southern Uplands on its 727 \nsoutheast side by the Southern Uplands Fault (SUF) (Fig. 8). Within this terrane, fluvial 728 \nand lacustrine Lower ORS rocks of late Silurian to early Devonian age are widely 729 \ndeveloped (Bluck 2000). In Strathmore the sequence consists mainly of fluvial 730 \nsandstones and conglomerates with volcanic rocks in its lower parts. These include the 731 \ndistinctive dacitic Lintrathen Tuff (Porphyry), dated at 415 \u00b1 6 Ma (Thirlwall 1988). In 732 \nits uppermost parts thick conglomerate units are developed locally adjacent to the HBFZ. 733 \nA prominent example is the c.1500 m thick Strathfinella Hill Conglomerate near 734 \nFettercairn that represents a proximal alluvial fan deposit (Haughton & Bluck 1988). 735 \nUnlike most conglomerate units in the Lower ORS sequence that consist largely of 736 \nreworked quartzite cobbles derived from the northeast, this unit contains first cycle 737 \nmetamorphic and volcanic clasts, derived from the northwest. It is dominated by 738 \nDalradian psammite and semipelite clasts that can be matched readily in the nearby 739 \nGrampian Highlands and clearly records syn-depositional uplift of the adjacent 740 \nHighlands. The conglomerate passes rapidly to the southeast into siltstones and 741 \nmudstones which have been dated as Emsian from miospores (Richardson et al. 1984). 742 \nThe Lower ORS sequence is folded into the Strathmore Syncline and Sidlaw Anticline 743 \n(Fig. 8) and overlapped unconformably by the late Devonian Upper ORS succession. 744 \nHence fault movement, deformation, uplift, and erosion are bracketed as mid-Devonian 745 \nin age. The Lintrathen Tuff crops out on both sides of the HBFZ, but shows an apparent 746 \nsinistral offset of some 34 kilometres. The structural features and timing of deformation 747 \nare consistent with an Acadian sinistral transpressional event focused along the HBFZ 748 \nduring the mid-Devonian (see Jones et al. 1997 for kinematic analysis; Tanner 2008). 749 \nDeposition of the youngest Emsian parts of the sequence appears to have overlapped with 750 \nfault movements along the HBFZ.  751 \n 752 \n Lower ORS sandstones, conglomerates, and andesitic and basaltic volcanic rocks also 753 \ncrop out near the southeast margin of the Midland Valley (Smith 1995) (Fig. 8). Again 754 \nthe volcanic rocks yield a Lochkovian age, here c. 412 Ma (Thirlwall, 1988).  The rocks 755 \nwere deformed during a mid-Devonian tectonic event whose effects become more intense 756 \ntowards the SUF. Deformation resulted in the formation of kilometre-scale, asymmetrical 757 \nanticlines and synclines whose axes trend NE to ENE, oblique to the SUF. They form en 758 \n\u00e9chelon arrays and Smith (1995) interpreted the fold pattern as indicative of sinistral 759 \ntranspression focused along the SUF. Floyd (1994) presented evidence for some 12 km 760 \nof sinistral offset of structures just north of the Loch Doon granite pluton. 761 \n 762 \nMeall Fuar-mhonaidh Outlier 763 \n Lower ORS sandstones and conglomerates are preserved in the Meall Fuar-mhonaidh 764 \noutlier adjacent to the GGF some 32 km southwest of Rosemarkie (see above for details 765 \nof lithology and structure) (Fig. 5).  The c. 2km thick sequence was deposited rapidly in a 766 \nfault-bounded basin (Mykura & Owens 1983). At its northeast end the Craig Nay 767 \nConglomerate contains large angular clasts of psammite and pink-orange leucogranite 768 \nveins that match those exposed in the Rosemarkie Inlier. Given its highly proximal 769 \nnature and high stratigraphical position, it is proposed that this conglomerate unit formed 770 \nby erosion of the inlier, which at the time was situated immediately to the northeast. This 771 \nwould date the start of exhumation of the inlier and sinistral movement on the GGF as 772 \nlate Emsian in accord with the age of leucogranite emplacement. Note that the eroded 773 \nmaterial would be derived from a much higher crustal level than that presently exposed. 774 \nThe fold pattern, limited WNW-directed thrusting and decreasing strain away from the 775 \nGGF in the outlier are all compatible with the development of a positive flower structure 776 \nlinked to sinistral transpression. Although this deformation cannot be dated with certainty 777 \nhere its low grade and structural pattern are best explained as due to the Acadian event. 778 \n 779 \nRosemarkie and Easter Ross 780 \n Deformation also affects the Lower ORS sequence northwest of the GGF on the 781 \nBlack Isle and in Easter Ross. Rogers et al (1989) placed the sequence in the late Emsian 782 \nand noted that its northwestern bounding faults, the Torr Achilty and Glaick-Polinturk 783 \nfaults, show evidence of limited compressional and strike-slip reactivation. Localised 784 \nthrusting occurs at the base of the succession, e.g. at Contin, and farther north on Struie 785 \nHill, where the gently ESE-dipping Struie Thrust forms a prominent feature marked by 786 \nlow grade mylonites (Armstrong, 1964). The thrust lies some 25 kilometres northwest of 787 \nthe GGF trace, and 20 km from the Cromarty Inlier (Fig.8). Underhill and Brodie (1993) 788 \ndeduced that the thrust formed as a consequence of footwall collapse linked to inversion 789 \nalong the Polinturk Fault. They interpreted the resultant flower structure as Permo-790 \nCarboniferous, linked to Variscan deformation in the Moray Firth, but its geometry is 791 \nalso compatible with Acadian transpression. In Easter Ross the Middle ORS sandstone 792 \nand conglomerate sequence (with fish beds) overlies the Lower ORS with slight to 793 \nmoderate angular unconformity and is in turn overlain by Upper ORS sandstones. The 794 \nwhole sequence is folded by the large open Black Isle Syncline, a probable Permo-795 \nCarboniferous age structure. 796 \n The angular unconformable Middle ORS \u2013 Lower ORS boundary can be traced 797 \nnortheastwards into the Golspie and Badbea basins, but at Sarclet (by Wick) in Caithness 798 \nthe two successions are conformable (Trewin & Thirlwall, 2002), possibly documenting 799 \nthe northward waning of Acadian tectonic effects.  800 \n 801 \nConclusions 802 \n The Rosemarkie Inlier consists of Moine psammites and semipelites and Lewisianoid 803 \nfelsic and mafic gneisses, all intruded by abundant pink leucogranite veins. Zircon U-Pb 804 \nLA-MC-ICP-MS data from two gneiss samples give Archaean protolith ages between 805 \n2930 and 2720 Ma; zircon morphologies are consistent with their formation in high grade 806 \ngneisses at deep crustal levels. One sample contains evidence of significant zircon 807 \ngrowth at c. 1745 Ma, indicative of Laxfordian reworking. Hence, the inlier exposes 808 \nstructurally interleaved Moine and Lewisianoid rocks, effectively providing a \u2018snapshot\u2019 809 \nof the deeper levels of the Caledonian orogen in this area. The interleaving and related 810 \nplanar fabrics predate leucogranite emplacement and may be late Silurian (Scandian), 811 \nearly Ordovician (Grampian) or Neoproterozoic (Knoydartian) in age. Similar 812 \nrelationships are found at the Sgurr Beag Thrust some 28 km to the WNW (Grant & 813 \nHarris 2000). 814 \n 815 \n Monazite and zircon U-Pb TIMS data from the leucogranite veins show that they 816 \nwere emplaced into the Moine and Lewisianoid rocks at 399 Ma. The veins are 817 \ndiscordant to the early fabrics (S1) but are strongly deformed and folded in three 818 \nstructural phases (D2-D4). Metamorphic assemblages and the structural style of the main 819 \nD2 deformation are compatible with their formation at depths of 12-15 km.  The inlier is 820 \noverlain unconformably by mid-Devonian (Eifelian \u2013 Givetian) sandstones and 821 \nconglomerates whose deposition commenced at c. 393 Ma; thus deformation and 822 \nexhumation are restricted to a maximum time frame of 6 Ma, implying local uplift rates 823 \nof 2-4 mm\/year.  824 \n  825 \n The structure of the Rosemarkie Inlier is dominated by a generally steep NE-trending 826 \nfoliation (S2), moderately NE-plunging lineation (L2\/L3) and strongly constrictional 827 \nstrains (Rathbone 1980). These features are compatible with its extrusion as an elongate 828 \n\u2018pip\u2019 at a sharp restraining bend of the Great Glen Fault (GGF) during sinistral 829 \ntranspression. The Rosemarkie and adjacent Cromarty inliers represent fault-bounded 830 \nstep-overs, formed as the locus of sinistral lateral movement on the GGF migrated onto 831 \nsub-parallel faults farther to the northwest.  832 \n 833 \n It is suggested that in early Devonian (Emsian) the Rosemarkie Inlier lay adjacent to 834 \nthe Meall Fuar-mhonaidh Outlier, now situated some 32 km to its SW. The Lower ORS 835 \nsequence in the outlier contains a highly proximal conglomerate unit at its northeast end 836 \nwhose clasts match the lithologies of the Rosemarkie Inlier. It is proposed that the final 837 \nstages of Lower ORS sedimentation in the outlier overlapped with the initial exhumation 838 \nof the inlier and thus the onset of significant lateral fault movement at c. 399 Ma. The 32 839 \nkm offset is broadly compatible with the strain values obtained from the deformed 840 \nleucogranites and the structural geometry in the inlier. 841 \n 842 \n The mid-Devonian sinistral transpressional event identified at Rosemarkie is 843 \ninterpreted as a manifestation of the Acadian Event, a short-lived northward-directed 844 \ncompressional pulse generated between 400 and 390 Ma by the collision of an Armorican 845 \nmicrocontinent with Avalonia (Woodcock et al. 2007). In Scotland this pulse was 846 \nfocused on the main terrane-bounding fault zones, namely the Southern Upland, 847 \nHighland Boundary and Great Glen fault zones. It was generally partitioned into sinistral 848 \nstrike-slip movements on the faults and related orthogonal compressional deformation. 849 \nIntensity of deformation is greatest adjacent to the fault zones and decreases with 850 \ndistance away from them. Deformation was preferentially taken up by the Lower ORS 851 \nsequences that had accumulated in nearby fault-bounded extensional basins. Adjacent to 852 \nthe HBFZ there seems to have again been an overlap of fault movement and the later 853 \nphases of ORS sedimentation. Positive flower structures were formed on the northwest 854 \nside of the GGF in the Meall Fuar-mhonaidh Outlier and in the Lower ORS succession in 855 \nEaster Ross, e.g. the Struie Thrust. The Lower ORS \u2013 Middle ORS unconformity can be 856 \ntraced northwards as far as Caithness, possibly reflecting the waning effects of the 857 \nAcadian Event. 858 \n  859 \n The mid-Devonian (Acadian) sinistral transpression marked a significant change in 860 \nthe kinematics of the Great Glen Fault. Prior to this event in the late Silurian and early 861 \nDevonian the fault appears to have been a planar structure and a focus for sinistral lateral 862 \nmovements, firstly in transpression (Stewart et al. 1999), but mainly in transtension 863 \n(Dewey & Strachan 2003). The end Caledonian uplift and formation of small scale basins 864 \nin the early Devonian altered the structural geometry, particularly in the Moray Firth 865 \narea. Hence, when the far-field Acadian effects reached northern Scotland, the GGF 866 \nformed a restraining bend to facilitate the migration of lateral movement northwestwards. 867 \nThis pattern of fault migration was repeated in late Palaeozoic and Mesozoic times 868 \nduring transtensional and transpressional events, both sinistral and dextral.  869 \n 870 \nAcknowledgements 871 \nThe detailed mapping and observations of P.A. Rathbone in the Rosemarkie Inlier 872 \nformed the basis for this study and his considerable contribution is readily acknowledged. 873 \nThanks are also due to the careful and helpful reviews by M. Stewart and N. Woodcock 874 \nand some serious editing by M. Krabbendam that have resulted in a considerably more 875 \ncoherent and focused paper.
