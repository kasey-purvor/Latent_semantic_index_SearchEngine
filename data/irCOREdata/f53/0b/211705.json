It asks to what extent the prohibition actually\nprevents post-bid, director-controlled defences that would not have been, in\nany event, either formally prohibited by UK company law without share-\nholder approval or practically ineffective as a result of the basic UK company\nlaw rule set. It finds that there would be minimal scope for director-deployed\ndefences in the absence of the non-frustration prohibition, and that, in the\ncontext of UK company law, such defences have limited scope to be\ndeployed for entrenchment purposes. Furthermore, this minimal scope for\nboard defensive action would, in order to be compliant with a director\u0092s\nduties, require a pre-bid, shareholder-approved alteration to the UK\u0092s default\nconstitutional balance of power between the board and the shareholder body\nto allow corporate powers to be used for defensive effect. In light of this\nconclusion the article looks for a rationale to justify denying shareholders the\nright to make this limited and potentially beneficial defensive election. It\nconcludes that no persuasive rationale is available and that the prohibition is\nunnecessary and without justification.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nGeneral Principle 31 together with Rule 212 of the United Kingdom\u0092s\nTakeover Code3 circumscribe the types of unilateral action that a listed\ncompany\u0092s board of directors may take when subject to, or about to be subject\nto,4 an unsolicited takeover bid. The principle set forth in General Principle 3\n* London School of Economics and Political Science. I would like to thanks Marlies Braun,\nBrett Carron and Alison Kershaw for comments on earlier versions of this paper.\n1 General Principle 3 provides that \u0091the board of an offeree company must act in the interests\nof the company as a whole and must not deny the holders of securities the opportunity to decide\non the merits of the bid\u0092 Takeover Code (2006), B1.\n2 Rule 21.1(a) now sets forth the general non-frustration prohibition previously contained in\nthe General Principle 7 of the previous edition of the Takeover Code. Rule 21.1(b) sets forth\nspecific prohibitions, for example, on the issue of authorized but unissued shares without share-\nholder approval (Takeover Code (2006) I 14).\n3 The eighth edition of the Takeover Code was published on 20 May 2006\n<http:\/\/www.thetakeoverpanel.org.uk\/new\/codesars\/DATA\/code.pdf>.\n4 The non-frustration prohibition applies where an offer has been made but also \u0091where the\ncompany has reason to believe that a bona fide offer might be imminent\u0092. For simplicity\u0092s sake\nthis article uses the term \u0091bid\u0092 to cover both actual and such imminent offers. This prohibition does\nnot extend to defences put in place prior to any bid having been made.\n[ICLQ vol 56, April 2007 pp 267\u0096308] doi: 10.1093\/iclq\/lei165\nand Rule 21 is known as the non-frustration principle and effectively limits\npost-bid defensive board action to persuading shareholders to reject the bid,\nlobbying regulatory competition authorities and searching for a more\nfavourable suitor, known colloquially as a \u0091white knight\u0092.5\nThis regulatory approach to takeover defences is the distinctive centrepiece\nof the Takeover Code and is viewed by many as the model for takeover\ndefence regulation.6 There is considerable support in UK academic, practi-\ntioner, and business circles for the non-frustration principle.7 The failure of the\nEuropean Union\u0092s Takeover Directive to require that all Member States imple-\nment a non-frustration approach was greeted with disquiet in these circles.8\nSupport for the principle is premised on several familiar rationales. First,\nshareholder sovereignty: shareholders should be able to decide whether or not\nto sell their shares. Paternalistic concerns about uninformed apathetic share-\nholders are misplaced in a bid context: collective action problems are less\nacute as individual shareholders have strong incentives to determine whether\nthe offer price is appropriate. Second, the non-frustration principle ensures an\nactive market for corporate control which reduces the scope for management\nto act in their own interests even prior to a bid and facilitates the replacement\nof inefficient or incompetent management. Third, a prohibition on defences\ncontrols the acute agency cost problem generated by the bid itself: the\nmanagers of a company subject to a bid are exposed to loss of office and\naccompanying benefits of control and may, therefore, deploy defences to\nprotect their own interests and not for any value-enhancing purpose.

Consider, for example, the comments of the\nHigh Level Group of Company Law Experts established by the European\nCommission to look at takeover regulation in 2001 who concluded that:\nAny regime which confers discretion on a board to impede or facilitate a bid\ninevitably involves unacceptable cost and risk\u0085defensive mechanisms are often\ncostly in themselves, apart from the fact that they deny the bidder the opportu-\nnity to create wealth by exploiting synergies after a successful bid. Most impor-\ntantly management are faced with a significant conflict of interests if a takeover\nbid is made ... their interest is in saving their jobs and reputation instead of\nmaximising the value of the company for shareholders. Their claims to represent\nthe interests of shareholders or other stakeholders are likely to be tainted by self-\ninterest. Shareholders should be able to decide for themselves (emphasis added).9\nThis consensus about the value of the non-frustration principle and the\ndestructive potential of takeover defences contrasts sharply with the parame-\nters of the takeover defence debate amongst scholars, practitioners and busi-\nness persons in the United States. Under the corporate law of most US states,\ntakeover defences which provide management with considerable discretion to\nresist if not unequivocally prohibit a bid are lawful and commonplace.10 The\nprimary initial response by corporate law scholars to the deployment and court\napproval of takeover defences in the 1980s was to view these defences through\nthe lens of managerial self-interest.11 This academic consensus contrasted\nwith a practitioner consensus that viewed takeover defences as a mechanism\nfor protecting shareholder value and other stakeholders by protecting the\ncompany\u0092s longer term strategic interests.12 The US academic consensus has,\nhowever, changed radically since these earlier encounters. The contemporary\nUS debate takes place within the narrow parameters of a general acceptance\nthat takeover defences should be available and that their availability poten-\ntially benefits shareholder value. Within these parameters a strident debate\ntakes place about the extent to which the board should be shielded from effec-\ntive court review of the deployment of these defences and about the amount of\ntime a board should be able to resist a bidder\u0092s advances. Today in the United\nStates a regime based upon Rule 21 would attract few proponents, even\namongst those who are seen as academic champions of shareholder rights.13\nThe UK\u0092s Takeover Defence Prohibition 269\n9 Winter Report (n 6) 21.\n10 See, eg, Unitrin v American General Corp 651 A.2d 1361 (Delaware, 1995).\n11 See, eg, FH Easterbrook and DR Fischel, The Economic Structure of Corporate Law (Harvard\nUniversity Press, Cambridge, 1991) noting at 162 that \u0091resistance is the phenomenon of interest\u0092.\n12 See, eg, M Lipton, \u0091Corporate Governance in the Age of Finance Corporatism\u0092 (1987) 136\nUniversity of Pennsylvania Law Review 1 (Martin Lipton is a Senior Partner at Wachtell, Lipton,\nRosen, and Katz and creator of the poison pill which is discussed at n 23 below).\n13 See, eg, L Bebchuk, \u0091The Case Against Board Veto in Corporate Takeovers\u0092 (2002) 69 The\nUniversity of Chicago Law Review 973, 1027, arguing against board veto but accepting that a\npoison pill should remain in place for \u0091a period reasonably sufficient for . . . exploring and\npreparing alternatives for shareholder consideration\u0092.\nThere are two central insights that have transformed the US debate. The\nfirst is that although takeover defences may be used to entrench management\nthey also have several potentially positive functions, depending on defence\ntype. First, they facilitate an undistorted shareholder vote on the proposed\ntransaction.14 Secondly, once the company is placed in play they allow the\nboard to determine a sale strategy and control the sale process: a controlled\nsale process is likely to result in a higher premium than an uncontrolled\nauction.15 Thirdly, related to this, they give the board more time to identify\nother potential value-enhancing restructuring or third party purchaser options.\nFourthly, they can prevent uninformed and uninformable shareholders from\nselling their shares for less than they are worth.16 Fifthly, they give the board\ngreater bargaining power which may, depending on the particular circum-\nstances, enable them to obtain a price that exceeds the board\u0092s reservation\nprice and to extract a greater share of any deal synergies.\nThe second insight is that the effectiveness of any tailored takeover\ndefence, with regard to both its ability to entrench management as well as the\npositive functions outlined above, is dependent upon the background set of\nvery basic corporate law rules and the extent to which those basic corporate\nlaw rules are default or mandatory rules. These basic rules include: rules\ngoverning the appointment and removal of the board of directors; the amend-\nment of constitutional documents; the calling of shareholder meetings; and\nagenda-setting for any such meetings. The functional effectiveness of a\ntakeover defence depends on its interaction with these basic rules. The appar-\nently potent potential of a takeover defence in one rule setting could be emas-\nculated by a different set of background rules. A different rule setting could\ndisable any entrenchment functionality but maintain a defence\u0092s effectiveness\nas a delay or sale-control mechanism.\nThis article is an inquiry into how these insights affect our understanding\nof the significance of and the justification for the UK\u0092s non-frustration prohi-\nbition. This inquiry requires that we posit a UK legal world without Rule 21.17\nThe article asks: what would be the scope for directors to deploy, and for what\npurposes could they deploy, takeover defences once the bid has been made if\nthere were no Rule 21 prohibition? Using the board controlled18 takeover\ndefences found in the United States as a hypothetically complete control set of\n270 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n14 ibid 981. See also n 133.\n15 M Kahan and EB Rock, \u0091Corporate Constitutionalism: Antitakeover Charter Provisions as\nPrecommitment\u0092 (2003) 152 University of Pennsylvania Law Review 473, 477 arguing that this\neffect of takeover defences has not been \u0091properly emphasized in the takeover literature\u0092.\n16 Unitrin v American General Corp (n 10).\n17 This contrasts with much of the existing scholarship on Rule 21 that has looked at the avail-\nability of pre-bid defences that do not require any post-bid board action such as multiple voting\nrights structures and placing shares with a friendly third party prior to any bid. See, eg, P Davies\n(n 5).\n18 \u0091Board controlled\u0092 is used here to refer to both defences which give the board a discretion\nto apply them or to lift them once the bid has been made (whether put in place pre-or post bid) as\nwell as to defences that involve post-bid corporate action that has a defensive effect.\ndefence types, the article considers the formal availability of such takeover\ndefences in the UK, their compliance with UK directors\u0092 duties and, to the\nextent that they are formally available and duty-compliant, their functional\neffectiveness when considered together with UK company law\u0092s background\nrule set.\nThe article argues that without Rule 21 the scope for post-bid defensive\naction by the board would be minimal. All mechanisms designed by US\ncompanies purely for defensive purposes19 which enable the board to control\nthe defence during the bid would either be unavailable or practically ineffec-\ntive. Even without Rule 21 any post-bid corporate action intended to have a\ndefensive effect requires either specific contemporaneous approval or pre-bid\nadjustment to the constitutional balance of power between the board and\nshareholders, to authorize corporate powers to be used for defensive purposes.\nFurthermore, the article argues that when made available to the board the\nscope to exploit this minimal defensive discretion for entrenchment rather than\nvalue-enhancing purposes is constrained by UK company law\u0092s basic manda-\ntory rules and is much more limited than in the United States. Accordingly,\nRule 21 denies UK shareholders the opportunity to elect to exploit aspects of\nthe positive functionality of takeover defences (from a shareholder value\nperspective) but it does not protect them from the negative entrenchment\neffects of available takeover defences as these effects are neutralized in any\nevent. In light of these conclusions the final part of the article considers\nwhether a persuasive rationale for Rule 21\u0092s continued existence can be artic-\nulated. The article submits that UK regulators and proponents of Rule 21 have\nfailed to articulate a plausible rationale.\nII. TAKEOVER DEFENCES IN THE ABSENCE OF THE NON-FRUSTRATION\nPROHIBITION\nIn contrast to the UK\u0092s prohibition on post-bid defensive action by the board,\nUS state corporations laws provide both generally applicable board-controlled\ntakeover defences, which companies may opt-out of, and permit the use of\ncompany-specific, board-controlled takeover defences. In Delaware, for exam-\nple, the Delaware General Corporation Law provides a statutory takeover\ndefence in the form of its Business Combination Statute (discussed in detail\nbelow) and the Delaware courts have permitted companies to develop and\ndeploy takeover defences post-bid provided that they are proportionate to the\nthreat which the bid poses to corporate policy and effectiveness.20 This defen-\nsive freedom has resulted in a range of creative defences devised by companies\u0092\nlegal and business advisors. Within the confines of the proportionality\nThe UK\u0092s Takeover Defence Prohibition 271\n19 eg poison pills or business combination statutes. See text to nn 23\u009636.\n20 Unocol Corp v Mesa Petroleum Co 493 A2.d 946 (Delaware, 1985).\nconstraint,21 the US experience of defensive measures provides us with a\nuseful and arguably complete control set of board-controlled defence types.\nThis section outlines the primary US board-controlled defence types and\nasks to what extent they would be available and\/or practically effective in a\nUK legal environment that did not contain the Takeover Code\u0092s non-frustra-\ntion prohibition. The section addresses this question in three parts. First, it\ndescribes the takeover defence types and considers their formal availability;\nthat is, does UK company law offer the tools necessary to put such defences\nin place? Secondly, it asks whether the use of the formally available defences\nis compatible with directors\u0092 duties owed to the company? Thirdly, it asks\nwhether, even if defences are formally available and compliant with directors\u0092\nduties, the context of UK company law\u0092s basic rule set enables or strips them\nof their effectiveness in practice. Effective takeover defences (ETDs) are those\ndefences that combine all three of these factors: they are formally available,\nduty-compliant and effective in practice.\nA. US Defence Types and their Theoretical UK Availability\nThere are five takeover defence types22 in the United States which locate the\npower to exercise the defence following a bid at board level: first, defences put\nin place through the creative use of options to purchase the company\u0092s equity\nwhich are issued to existing shareholders; second, business combination\ndefences provided either by the state corporation code or set forth in the\ncompany\u0092s constitutional documents; third, the restructuring of the company\u0092s\nequity and debt; fourth, the defensive effect of business decisions taken\noutside of the ordinary course of business; and fifth, tactical litigation\ndesigned to forestall or stop a takeover bid.\n1. Shareholder rights plans: poison pills\nThe most important type of board-controlled US takeover defence is a share-\nholder rights plan. This defence involves warrants issued by the target\ncompany to existing shareholders to purchase equity in the target company\n(flip-in plan) or in the bidder should a successful bidder merge with the target\n(flip-over plan).23 These are the infamous poison pill24 defences. They are put\n272 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n21 The proportionality constraint was significantly relaxed post-Unocal following the Delaware\nSupreme Court\u0092s decisions in Paramount Communications, Inc v Time Incorporated 571 A.2d\n1140 (Delaware, 1990) and Unitrin v American General Corp (n 10).\n22 This section does not set forth an exclusive list of possible defences, only those that involve\npost-bid board action without shareholder approval; that is, those defences caught by Rule 21.\n23 For a more detailed explanation of flip-in and flip over pills as well as a review of the initial\napproval of these devices by the Delaware Courts see JP Lowry, \u0091\u0093Poison Pills\u0094 in US\nCorporations\u0097A Re-Examination\u0092 [May 1992] Journal of Business Law 337.\n24 The term poison pill is sometimes used in UK debates as a general term for takeover\ndefences, see, B Clarke, \u0091Regulating Poison Pill Devices\u0092 (2004) 4 Journal of Corporate Law\nin place without shareholder approval by the issuance of the warrants as an\ninterim dividend. The rights attached to these warrants are set forth in a share-\nholder rights plan adopted by the board. The warrants are attached to the\nshares and transferred with the shares prior to a triggering event. The warrants\nhave no economic value until triggered by a hostile bidder. If such a bidder\ncrosses a specified ownership threshold, which is typically between 10 and 20\nper cent of the target\u0092s outstanding voting shares, without obtaining target\nboard approval then the warrants give the existing shareholders (excluding the\nbidder) the right to purchase voting equity at, usually, a 50 per cent discount.\nThe effect of the pill if triggered is to significantly dilute the bidder\u0092s existing\nshareholding in the target (flip-in plan) or the shareholders of the bidder itself\nfollowing a subsequent merger (flip-over plan), resulting in a substantial trans-\nfer in value to existing target shareholders. Accordingly, no bidder would ever,\nand has ever, swallowed a pill. The shareholder rights plan provides that the\nboard has the right to redeem the warrants. Until the board does so the tender\noffer will not be able to proceed. Importantly, in most US states a pill can be\nadopted at any time without the requirement to obtain shareholder approval\neven after a bidder has announced its intention to commence a tender offer.25\nVariations on the redemption provisions, that are not valid in all states, include\nprovisions that prevent redemption for a time period following the announce-\nment of the bid (a no-hand pill) and continuing director provisions that allow\nonly the board members that held office at the time the pill was adopted to\nredeem the pill (dead-hand pill).26\nIn the UK Rule 21 would not prevent putting a poison pill into place prior\nto any bid.27 However, following the announcement of the bid and the bidders\u0092\nrequest to redeem the pill, the board\u0092s refusal to redeem a pill would violate\nRule 21 as it would amount to action that would frustrate the bid and prevent\nthe shareholders from deciding on the merits of the offer. In theory, a pill\ncould be put in place that has no board redemption provision, which would,\ntherefore, require no action on the part of the board. However, it is highly\nunlikely that any company would attempt to put in place such a pill as it would\ndeter any friendly bid if all shareholders could not be persuaded to relinquish\nthe warrants.28\nThe UK\u0092s Takeover Defence Prohibition 273\nStudies 51. This article adopts the US approach to this terminology where poison pill is used\nexclusively to refer to shareholder rights plans.\n25 Unitrin v American General Corp (n 10).\n26 No-hand and dead-hand pills are not permitted in Delaware (see Carmody v Toll Brothers,\nInc 723 A.2d 1180 (Delaware, 1998) and Quickturn Design Sys, Inc v Shapiro 721 A.2d 1281\n(Delaware, 1998)), however, dead-hand pills have been approved in Georgia (Invacare Corp v\nHealthdyne Tech 968 F Supp 1678 (ND Georgia, 1997)) and no-hand pills have been approved in\nPennsylvania (AMP v Allied Signal No 98-4405 LEXIS 15617 (Pennsylvania, 1998)).\n27 See G Barboutis, \u0091Takeover Defence Tactics II: Specific Defensive Devices\u0092 (1999) 20\nCompany Lawyer 40, discussing the availability of pills in the UK prior to a bid.\n28 cf Criterion Properties plc v Stratford UK Properties LLC [2002] EWCA Civ 1783.\nIn the absence of the Rule 21 prohibition, poison pills would be theoreti-\ncally possible under UK company law. Boards of directors of public compa-\nnies are usually authorized to make interim dividends.29 A warrant could be\nissued to all shareholders of the company as an interim dividend. As with a US\npoison pill, the rights attached to those warrants would be set forth in a share-\nholder rights plan. However, in order to issue such warrants the shareholders\nin a general meeting would have to provide the board with authority to allot\nthe warrants.30 In contrast to the US, therefore, the pill would only be avail-\nable with pre- or post-bid shareholder approval.\nAn additional problem with regard to its availability arises from the terms\nof the United Kingdom Listing Authority\u0092s (UKLA) Listing Principle 5 which\nprovides that for listed companies holders of the same class of shares be\ntreated \u0091equally in respect of the rights attaching to such\u0092 shares. Following a\ntriggering event the bidder would not be able to exercise the right to purchase\nshares at a discount. If the bidder was allowed to do so it would vitiate the\ndefensive impact of the pill as there would be no bidder value-dilution.\nArguably, this discriminates against the bidder. The strong case that a pill does\nnot amount to a violation of the equal treatment principle would be as follows:\nthe warrant provides a contingent right which is applicable to all shareholders\nequally; should a bidder-shareholder not comply with the conditions of that\nwarrant it would not be exercisable; the inability of the bidder to exercise any\nwarrant rights stems not from shareholder rights discrimination but from the\nbidder\u0092s own failure to comply with the warrant\u0092s conditionality. However, if\nthe UKLA rejected this argument and viewed these devices as discriminatory\nthey would be unavailable to UK listed companies.\n2. Business combination defences\nA business combination defence places limitations on the ability of a success-\nful bidder to combine with the target company, through a merger or any type\nof asset disposition or lease, for a specified period following the completion of\nthe tender offer if the bidder crosses a share ownership threshold without the\napproval of the incumbent board. Such a restriction inhibits a successful\nbidder from integrating and restructuring the target company and delays the\nrealization of any expected synergies. For example, section 203 of the\nDelaware General Corporation Code provides for a threshold of 15 per cent of\nthe outstanding voting stock of the corporation and for a three-year bar on any\nbusiness combination.31 Post-completion, these restrictions may be waived\n274 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n29 Table A provides for interim dividends in Art 103.\n30 Section 80 of the Companies Act 1985 requires that the board is authorized by the share-\nholder to body to allot \u0091relevant securities\u0092, which are defined in s 80(2) to include \u0091any right to\nsubscribe for, or to convert into any security into, shares of the company\u0092 (ss 549\u009651 CA 2006).\n31 This restriction is inapplicable if following the completion of the transaction in which the\nbidder crosses the 15 per cent threshold the bidder owns 85 per cent of the disinterested outstand-\ning voting stock of the company s 203(a)(2) DGCL.\nonly with board approval and the approval of two-thirds of the disinterested\nshareholders.32 As prior management may form a substantial block of the\nremaining shareholders this post-purchase approval may be unavailable.\nFurthermore, the inability to merge the target with the bidder or one of its\nsubsidiaries prevents the bidder from squeezing out management ownership\neither through a short form or a long form merger.33 No other compulsory\npurchase mechanism is provided by Delaware law.\nVariations on the business combination defence are common in many\npublic company constitutional documents, whether or not the applicable\ncorporation law provides for such defences. The important difference between\nstatutory business combination defences as compared to similar defences that\ncan be set forth in a company\u0092s constitutional documents is that shareholder\napproval is not required to put them in place. The default position is their\napplication. To disapply them the company must amend its constitutional\ndocuments to opt out. Opting out, however, is no longer an option once the\nbusiness combination provision has been triggered.34\nIn the UK there is no reason why such restrictions could not be placed in\nthe constitutional documents at the IPO stage or, with shareholder approval, at\nany time prior to any takeover bid. Such provisions would prevent any post-\ncompletion asset sale or any merger or consolidation pursuant to a scheme of\narrangement.35 Rule 21 does not prevent the shareholders from amending the\nconstitution to include such a provision. It would, however, prevent the board\nfrom refusing to disapply the business combination provision to a specific\nbidder, as such a refusal would deny the shareholders the opportunity to\n\u0091decide on the merits of the bid\u009236 as a bidder would be unlikely to proceed\nuntil the defence is raised.\n3. Restructuring defences\nThe third type of board-controlled defence is the restructuring defence, which\ngenerally involves both a distribution to shareholders through an extraordinary\ndividend or share buy-back coupled with, and often funded by, either a place-\nment of a block of shares with a friendly third party or a substantial increase\nin the company\u0092s leverage. The restructuring response is likely to depend on\nthe nature of the bidder. A highly leveraged bidder, such as a private equity\nThe UK\u0092s Takeover Defence Prohibition 275\n32 Section 203(a)(3) DGCL.\n33 A short-form merger takes place where a parent that owns at least 90 per cent of the voting\nshares of a subsidiary merges with that subsidiary (s 253 DGCL). All other mergers are long-form\nmergers (s 251 DGCL).\n34 Section 203(b)(3) DGCL.\n35 Section 425 CA 1985 (ss 895\u00969 CA 2006). In re Oceanic Steam Navigation Company Limited\n[1939] Ch 41, the court held that it could not sanction any arrangement or compromise (under ss 153\nand 154 of the Companies Act 1929) which involved a transfer of assets where the memorandum\ndid not include a power to \u0091sell or dispose of the whole or any part of the undertaking\u0092.\n36 General Principle 3 and Rule 21.1(a) Takeover Code (2006).\nbidder, will require the target\u0092s free cash flow to finance its own debt.37 If\nprior to the completion of the bid the target\u0092s leverage substantially increases\nthen free cash flow will be inadequate and a bid impossible. However, if the\nbidder is an industrial cash or equity bidder which would not be deterred by\nthe additional leverage, the restructuring is likely to focus on preventing the\nbidder from obtaining effective control. The recent proposed defensive\nresponse by the Luxembourg-based steel company Arcelor following the\nhostile approach made by Mittal Steel is a simple example of the latter type of\nrestructuring. The defensive proposal involved issuing shares to a friendly\nthird party, Severstal, amounting to 32 per cent of the company\u0092s outstanding\nshares. The company also proposed to effect a share buy-back which would\nhave increased Severstal\u0092s stake in the company to 38 per cent.38 An equity\nrestructuring defence is dependent on the company\u0092s ability to find and to be\npermitted to make an issue of shares to a friendly third party. A debt restruc-\nturing defence is dependent on the company being sufficiently cash rich to\nservice a substantial increase in debt and being permitted to make a very large\ndistribution.\nThere is much less scope for carrying out restructuring defences in the UK\nthan in the United States. Taking Delaware as the US comparator, if the\ncompany has sufficient authorized share capital the board has the power to\nissue a substantial block of shares to a friendly third party. No shareholder\napproval is required.39 However, if the company is listed on the New York\nStock Exchange and the share issue amounts to more than 20 per cent of the\noutstanding voting shares of the company then shareholder approval is\nrequired.40 Corporation statutes do not impose mandatory pre-emption rights\nand, although companies may of their own accord provide pre-emption rights,\nsuch provision would be unusual in US publicly traded companies.41\nDelaware companies have considerable flexibility to make large interim divi-\ndends provided that the company was not insolvent prior to, or as a result of,\nthe dividend.42 Companies may make dividends out of surplus,43 which could\ninclude capital received for prior issues of shares in excess of the par value of\nthose shares.44 Nimble dividends out of the most recent year\u0092s profits may be\nmade even though the company\u0092s cumulative losses exceed its profits.45\n276 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n37 Assuming any financial assistance problems can be resolved (Part V, Chapter VI CA 1985;\nPart 18 Chapter 2 CA 2006).\n38 See \u0091Doubts on Arcelor\u0092s bear-hug strategy now the Luxembourg company faces gover-\nnance issues\u0092 Financial Times (London, 31 May 2006).\n39 Section 161 DGCL.\n40 New York Stock Exchange Listing Manual, para 312.03(c).\n41 B Black and JC Coffee, \u0091Britannia: Institutional Investor Behavior Under Limited\nRegulation\u0092 (1994) 92 Michigan Law Review 1997.\n42 Delaware Fraudulent Conveyance Act (Delaware Code, Title 6, subtitle II, Chapter 13, s\n1305).\n43 DGCL, s 170(a).\n44 DGCL, s 154.\n45 DGCL, s 170(a).\nDirectors are authorized to repurchase shares provided that it does not impair\nthe capital of the company.46 No shareholder approval is required. All repur-\nchased shares may be retained as treasury shares unless retired and may be\nresold to a third party.\nCompare this level of flexibility to the situation facing a UK company\nconsidering a restructuring defence (in the absence of Rule 21).47 UK compa-\nnies face considerable restrictions in issuing shares to friendly third parties\nwithout post-bid shareholder approval. Pursuant to current UK law, a board of\ndirectors can only issue shares to a third party if the company has sufficient\nauthorized share capital, the shareholders have granted authority to allot the\nshares48 and, if the shares are issued for cash consideration, the shareholders\nhave disapplied their statutorily imposed mandatory pre-emption rights.49\nPublic companies generally seek annual resolutions that grant authority to\nallot shares. Such a grant of authority usually specifies the type of share, for\nexample, ordinary shares, and may be conditional or unconditional.50 Even\nassuming a substantial and rolling grant of authority to allot shares,51 it is clear\nthat institutional shareholders value their pre-emption rights and although they\nare willing to grant a waiver of pre-emption rights for issuances of up to 5 per\ncent of outstanding shares each year, which should not exceed more than 7.5\nper cent in any three-year rolling period, they look dimly upon and will oppose\nmore extensive waivers.52 Although the recent introduction of treasury shares\nmay provide some companies with additional flexibility, the pre-emption\nregime applies to these shares as well.53 In theory UK boards have some scope\nto avoid these restrictions as pre-emption rights are only applicable if the share\nissue is for cash only and contains no in-kind consideration.54 Even an\ninsignificant in-kind component would result in the avoidance of the pre-\nemption right regime. However, given that UK institutional investors value\npre-emption rights, any attempt by companies faced with a control threat to\nThe UK\u0092s Takeover Defence Prohibition 277\n46 DGCL, s 160. Capital here refers to the stated capital of the company which in many cases\nwill only be the aggregate par value of the issued shares. If net assets post-repurchase are less than\nstated capital, capital will be impaired (B Manning and JJ Hanks, Jr, Legal Capital (3rd edn\nFoundation Press, Westbury, NY, 1990) 34).\n47 Note 3 to Rule 21 of the Takeover Code (2006) provides that interim dividends issued during\nthe offer period which are not in the ordinary course of business may violate the non-frustration\nprinciple.\n48 Section 80 CA 1985 (ss 549\u009651 CA 2006). See G Barboutis, \u0091Takeover Defence Tactics II:\nSpecific Defensive Devices\u0092 (1999) 20 Company Lawyer 40 discussing, amongst others, author-\nity to allot and pre-emption rights in relation to share issues as a defence tactic.\n49 Sections 89 and 95 CA 1985. (ss 561, 570, 571 CA 2006). (The Companies Act 2006 abol-\nishes authorized share capital, however, it leaves authority to allot and pre-emption rights in\nplace).\n50 Section 80(3) CA 1985. (ss 549\u009651CA 2006).\n51 See, eg, Vodafone Plc obtained at its AGM in July 2006 authority to allot 9,000,000,000\nordinary shares amounting to 14.9 per cent of the capital of the company.\n52 Preemption Group Principles, Principles 8 and 10. See n 164 for further detail.\n53 Section 94(3)(A) CA 1985 (s 560(2)(b) CA 2006).\n54 Section 89(4) CA 1985 (s 565 CA 2006).\navoid pre-emption rights by combined cash and in-kind consideration would\nmost likely result in standard conditions being placed upon future grants of\nauthority to allot shares that would prevent any other non pre-emptive defen-\nsive issues.55\nOn the distribution side, UK regulation is again more restrictive. To be able\nto make a substantial interim dividend UK public companies must comply\nwith the net-profits test which requires that total cumulative realized profits\nexceed total cumulative realized losses by the amount of the dividend56 and\nthe net assets test, which requires that net assets exceed, amongst others, share\ncapital and any share premium by the amount of the dividend.57 A restructur-\ning defence which involves a substantial distribution will, therefore, only be\navailable to companies who have a very healthy balance sheet. Any attempt to\nalter the balance of control by making the distribution through a share repur-\nchase is not as readily available to boards of UK companies as boards are not\nauthorized to make such repurchases without shareholder approval.58\n4. Business decisions with a defensive impact\nThis category of defence involves business decisions that may have been taken\nbecause of their defensive impact but which can also be characterized as busi-\nness decisions which were taken on the basis of the decision\u0092s business merits\nrather than its defensive impact. Post-bid this could include the sale of a key\nbusiness asset or division, which is colloquially known as a \u0091crown jewels\u0092\ndefence, as the bidder would not be interested in the company without this asset.\nPost-bid, Rule 21 prohibits the sale or purchase of a material59 amount of\nassets60 or entering into any contracts which are not in the ordinary course of\nbusiness.61 In the hypothetical absence of the non-frustration principle, the\nprimary form of regulation of these types of defensive decisions would be\nthrough directors\u0092 duties, which is discussed in detail below. In addition to\nthis, a listed company board\u0092s freedom to sell all or a substantial stake in one\nof the company\u0092s important assets or divisions is constrained by the Listing\nRules\u0092 regulation of Significant Transactions. Pursuant to Listing Rule 10.5, if\nthe transaction amounts to 25 per cent of the target\u0092s gross assets, or the prof-\n278 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n55 Section 80(3) CA 1985 (s 551(2) CA 2006) provides that any authority to allot \u0091may be\nconditional or subject to conditions\u0092.\n56 Section 263 CA 1985 (s 830 CA 2006).\n57 Section 264 CA 1985 (s 831 CA 2006).\n58 Section 164 CA 1985 (off-market purchase: special resolution) (s 694 CA 2006); s 166 CA\n1985 (market purchase: ordinary resolution) (s 701 CA 2006).\n59 The Takeover Code does not provide bright line rules to determine materiality, rather it\nprovides guidelines for the Panel to take into account in determining whether a transaction\ninvolves a material amount. These involve comparing the value and profitability of the assets\nagainst the target\u0092s market capitalization, its assets and profitability (note 2 to Rule 21, Takeover\nCode (2006)).\n60 Rule 21.1(b)(iv).\n61 Rule 21.1(b)(v).\nits attributable to the assets represent 25 per cent of the profits of the target, or\nthe consideration is 25 per cent of the target\u0092s market capitalization,62 then the\ntransaction is classified by the Listing Rules as a Class 1 transaction which\nmust be conditional upon, and cannot be carried out without, shareholder\napproval.63 This contrasts with Delaware law where shareholder approval is\nrequired for a disposal only when it amounts to the sale of \u0091all or substantially\nall\u0092 of the company\u0092s assets.64\n5. Litigation\nIn the United States defensive litigation by the target is a familiar aspect of\ncontested takeover bids. Litigation is usually based on the bidder\u0092s failure to\ncomply with the disclosure obligations set forth in sections 13(d) and 14(d) of\nthe Securities and Exchange Act 1934 and the rules promulgated thereunder.65\nTarget companies have commonly been granted private rights of action under\nthese provisions by US courts.66 In addition, targets sometimes commence\nprivate antitrust litigation under the Clayton Act on the basis that they will\nsuffer an antitrust injury as a result of the takeover. There is, however,\nconflicting authority67 on the extent to which targets have standing to bring\nsuch an action, with more recent authority suggesting that it would be difficult\nfor targets to obtain standing.68\nCommencing litigation in the United States has the potential to serve two\ndefensive objectives. First, it can create delay in the bid process thereby giving\nthe board more time to prepare alternative defences or identify other bidders.\nSecond, it may, depending on the nature of the claim and the merits of the\ncase, halt the bid altogether. Since the approval of the poison pill in the mid-\n1980s69 and clarification that a pill may be put in place after a bid\nThe UK\u0092s Takeover Defence Prohibition 279\n62 UKLA, Listing Rules, LR 10 (Significant Transactions), Annex 1 (the Class Tests).\n63 These provisions also regulate the issue of shares by a subsidiary that represents 25 per cent\nof the gross assets or profits of the target group, if the effect of such an issue of shares is \u0091equiv-\nalent to the disposal of 25% of the group\u0092 (Listing Rule 10.2.8).\n64 Section 271(a) DGCL.\n65 Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act 1934 and Regulation 13D promulgated thereun-\nder require disclosure on Schedule 13D when a shareholder acquires 5 per cent of a company\u0092s equity\nsecurities. Section 14(d) of the Securities and Exchange Act 1934 and Regulation 14D promulgated\nthereunder requires disclosure on Schedule TO at the time the tender offer is commenced.\n66 eg Chevron Corp v Pennzoil Co 974 F.2d 1165 (9th Cir, 1992).\n67 See Consolidated Gold Fields PLC v Minorco, SA, 871 F.2d 252, 258 (2d Cir, 1989) where\nthe Second Circuit Court of Appeals granted standing and Anago Inc v Techno Medical Products\nInc 976 F.2d 248 (1992) where the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the target did not have\nstanding and stating that the decision in Consolidated Gold was inconsistent with the Supreme\nCourt\u0092s decision in Cargill, Inc v Monfort of Colorado, Inc, 479 US 104 (1986).\n68 JM Jacobson and T Greer, \u0091Twenty-One Years Of Antitrust Injury: Down The Alley With\nBrunswick v Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat\u0092 (1998) 66 Antitrust Law Journal 273, 305 noting that \u0091most\nother courts have sided with the Fifth Circuit\u0092; see, eg, Moore Corporation Limited v Wallace\nComputer Services 907 F Supp 1545 (Delaware, 1995) 1556.\n69 Moran v Household International, Inc 500 A2d 1346 (Delaware, 1985).\ncommences,70 it is unlikely that litigation is used as a delaying device; the pill,\nparticularly when combined with a staggered board,71 is likely to provide\nmuch more time than a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunc-\ntion.72 Furthermore, it is unusual for litigation to act as a \u0091show stopper\u0092.73 In\nrelation to disclosure litigation it is more common for the courts to require\ncorrective disclosure.74 In relation to antitrust litigation, if standing can be\nestablished, which as noted above is uncertain, and the merits of the case are\nstrong then injunctive relief may temporarily75 or even permanently put a stop\nto the tender offer. Such injunctive relief is, however, very rare. Since 1992\nwhen the 5th Circuit of the US Court of Appeals held in Anago Inc v Techno\nMedical Products Inc that the target did not have standing, only one case76 has\ngranted preliminary injunctive relief in relation to an antitrust suit brought by\nthe target.77\nWhereas in the United States the defensive implications of litigation have\nbeen rendered trivial by the ready availability of more powerful defences, to\nthe extent that such other defences would not be available or are practically\nineffective in the UK, litigation (in the absence of Rule 21) would have the\npotential to play a more important defensive role. To what extent would liti-\ngation be available to UK targets? The scope for tactical litigation under the\nCity Code on Takeovers and Mergers, the predecessor of today\u0092s Takeover\nCode (2006), was limited as the City Code did not have the force of law.78 As\nthe Panel performed public law duties, the Panel\u0092s decisions themselves could\nbe subject to judicial review. However, in R v Panel on Take-overs and\nMergers, ex parte Datafin79 the Court of Appeal clarified that the courts will\nnot intervene in the Panel\u0092s decision during the course of the bid, rather they\nwill only intervene through declaratory orders providing guidance for future\nPanel decision-making.

For an\nexcellent analysis of the earlier scholarship see T Ogowewo, \u0091Tactical Litigation in Takeover\nBids\u0092 [2007] Journal of Business Law (forthcoming).\n78 For a review of the scope for defensive litigation pre- and post the Takeovers Directive\n(Interim Implementation Regulations) 2006 (which were superseded by Part 28 of the CA 2006\nAct) see T Ogowewo, op cit. 79 [1987] 2 WLR 699.\nAct 200680 has not increased the scope for defensive litigation during the\ncourse of a bid based on Code violations. The Act provides that no person\noutside the Panel will be able to apply for injunctive relief81 and that there is\nno private law action for breach of statutory duty for \u0091contravention of a rule-\nbased requirement or a disclosure requirement\u0092.82\nAccordingly, Rule 21 plays no role in inhibiting Code-related litigation. To\nwhat extent, therefore, would there be scope for non-Code-related litigation in\nthe absence of Rule 21? It was not until the Panel\u0092s statement in the\nConsolidated Gold Fields case,83 where the UK target\u0092s US subsidiary\nobtained a US preliminary injunction for breach of US antitrust laws, that the\nPanel took a position on the implications of such litigation for the non-frus-\ntration principle. In this case, having determined that the litigation had a frus-\ntrating effect, they instructed Consolidated Gold Fields to discontinue the\nproceedings or obtain shareholder approval to continue the proceedings. Prior\nto this date there were only three cases in which the target brought an action\nfor injunctive relief to prevent the bid going forward.84 One of these cases,\nCartwright (Holdings) Plc v Newman Tonks Group Plc,85 was unsuccessful\nbut also Code-related and therefore of no precedential value for contemporary\ntargets. The other two, Dunford Elliot v Johnston & Firth Brown86 and Marina\nDevelopment Group v Local London, related to the use of confidential infor-\nmation about the target held by the bidder and resulted in the granting of an\ninjunction at first instance in Dunford Elliot, which was overruled by the Court\nof Appeal, and a temporary suspension of the bid for five days in the case if\nMarina Development.87\nIn the absence of Rule 21, it is submitted that the scope for non-Code-\nrelated defensive litigation would be insignificant.

In addition, in the rare case\nwhere a bid for a UK company involves dual UK and US offers with the filing\nof tender offer disclosure documents under US securities laws,90 there may be\nscope for defensive US disclosure litigation which may generate delay and\ncorrective disclosure. Finally, it may be possible to obtain injunctive relief in\nrelation to a breach of an obligation owed by the bidder to the target company,\nfor example, in relation to confidential information. However, the small\nnumber of such cases prior to the Panel\u0092s 1989 statement suggests that such\ncases would be rare.\nB. Defences and Directors\u0092 Duties\n1.

Directors subject to English law have a fidu-\nciary obligation to act in good faith in the best interests of the company. If\ndefensive action is used to protect personal benefits of control then directors\nare in breach of this fiduciary obligation.92 In the leading cases dealing with\nthe exercise of corporate power in control contests, the courts have, without\nreservation, accepted the bona fides of the directors.93 Nevertheless, good\nfaith has not been treated as a sufficient condition for legality. English courts\nhave asked whether the exercise of a corporate power for defensive purposes\n282 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n89 Section 120(3) Enterprise Act 2002.\n90 eg Ford\u0092s purchase of Jaguar in 1989 involved concurrent US and UK offers (\u0091Ford\u0092s Jaguar\nOffer Unconditional\u0092 Financial Times (London, 12 Dec 1989)).\n91 The likelihood of suit will increase markedly upon the coming into force of the Companies\nAct 2006 which makes it easier for shareholders to bring a derivative suit (ss 260\u00964 CA 2006).\n92 As Professor Sealy notes corporate action in bad faith or resulting from improper motives is\nsometimes included in the improper purpose doctrine, however, \u0091in this type of situation, the\nexpression \u0091improper purpose\u0092 is simply a restatement in negative terms of the \u0093bona fide in the\ninterests of the company\u0094 test\u0092 (L Sealy, Cases and Materials in Company Law (OUP, Oxford,\n2001) 310).\n93 See, eg, Howard Smith v Ampol Petroleum Ltd [1974] AC 821 and Hogg v Cramphorn Ltd\n[1967] Ch 254.\nis a legitimate exercise of the corporate power. The applicable doctrine is the\nimproper purpose doctrine. Most commonly, the scope and operation of this\ndoctrine is described through a theory about the delegation of powers which is\nanalogous to the contractual constraints placed on company capacity and\nauthority to act; the corporate contract delegates to the directors a set of\npowers, but they cannot misuse those powers for purposes that are not within\nthe scope of the delegation.94 In Howard Smith Ltd v Ampol Petroleum Ltd\nLord Wilberforce asked whether a fiduciary power \u0091has been exercised for the\npurpose for which it was conferred\u0092 and held that \u0091although the exercise of\nsuch a power may be formally valid [it] may be attacked on the ground that it\nwas not exercised for the purpose for which it was granted\u0092.95 The codifica-\ntion of directors\u0092 duties set forth in the Companies Act 2006 draws literally on\nLord Wilberforce\u0092s approach providing that a \u0091director of a company must\nonly exercise powers for the purposes for which they are conferred\u0092.96\nThere are two fundamental problems with this theory of power-specific\ndelegation in the corporate context. First, in contrast to the drafting of state\nconstitutions the drafting and formation of a corporate constitution is not the\nproduct of minuted debate about the purpose and intention of specific rules. In\nregard to most delegated powers there is no record that can enlighten a discus-\nsion about the proper purposes for which a specific power can be used. Indeed,\nmost companies\u0092 powers are not the product of debate but of borrowed boiler-\nplate, whether in the form of Table A or professionally tailored versions\nthereof. At most the intention could be said to provide the company with the\npowers it needs to run the business. Secondly, because the future is unpre-\ndictable the viability and effectiveness of a corporate contract is dependent on\nit being incomplete. No one can predict all the business problems and oppor-\ntunities that will face the company in its future and the value-generating\npurposes for which the delegated powers may have to be used. Delegated\ncorporate powers therefore do not contain at any time, at the time they were\ngranted or at any point thereafter, an immanent, exhaustive list of proper\npurposes. Accordingly, any attempt by courts to assess original intent, to\nimpute or to supplement purposive constraints is misdirected and hopeless.97\nThe logical dead end of this theory of delegated power-specific proper\npurposes is quickly reached in Howard Smith when their Lord Wilberforce\nacknowledges that identifying valid purposes \u0091clearly cannot be done by\nenumeration, since the variety of situations facing directors of different types\nThe UK\u0092s Takeover Defence Prohibition 283\n94 J Farrer and B Hannigan, Farrer\u0092s Company Law (4th edn, Butterworths, London, 1998)\n389: \u0091the first step then is to construe the article conferring the power in order to ascertain the\nnature of the power and the limits within which it may be exercised.\u0092\n95 Howard Smith v Ampol Petroleum Ltd [1974] AC 821, 834.\n96 Section 171(b) CA 2006.\n97 See Nolan arguing that \u0091the proper purpose doctrine is better seen as supplementing the\nexpressed intention of those who conferred discretionary power on the board\u0092 in RC Nolan, \u0091The\nProper Purpose Doctrine and Company Directors\u0092 in BAK Rider (eds), The Realm of Company\nLaw (Kluwer Law International, London, 1998) 19.\nof company in different situations cannot be anticipated\u0092.98 Nevertheless, the\nlogic of the theory of purposive constraints on delegated powers results in the\nprovision of an opaque and unavoidably unhelpful power-specific rule of\nconstruction\/ implied intention:\nIn their Lordships\u0092 opinion it is necessary to start with a consideration of the\npower whose exercise is in question, in this case a power to issue shares. Having\nascertained, on a fair view, the nature of this power, and having defined as can\nbest be done in light of modern conditions the, or some, limits within which it\nmay be exercised, it is then necessary for the court . . . to examine the substan-\ntial purpose for which it was exercised.99\nThe improper purpose doctrine should not be viewed as a rule of construction\nin relation to individual powers, designed to access the original or imputed\ndelegated purposive intent of those powers. It is a doctrine that provides regu-\nlation of the balance of power between the board and the shareholder body. As\nProfessor Davies notes, when Lord Wilberforce in Howard Smith comes to\ndetermine the legitimacy of the target board\u0092s action, the finding of illegality\nis not the result of specific analysis of the purposes for which the target\u0092s\npower to issue shares could be used but rather it is viewed as a function of the\nconstitutional arrangements for the distribution of power between the board\nand the shareholder body.100 Professor Sealy also argues that the improper\npurpose doctrine should be viewed in broad constitutional terms rather than\nthrough the lens of delegated powers; however, he submits that Lord\nWilberforce\u0092s consideration of company constitutional arrangements was not\npart of the ratio of the case.101 With respect, Lord Wilberforce\u0092s constitutional\nobservation is inseparable from the holding, whereas the rule of construction\/\nimputation disappears when the facts of the case are engaged:\nthe constitution of a limited company normally provides for directors, with\npowers of management, and shareholders, with defined voting powers having\npower to appoint the directors, and to take, in general meeting, by majority vote,\ndecisions on matters not reserved for management. Just as it is established that\ndirectors, within their management powers, may take decisions against the\nwishes of the majority of shareholders, and indeed that the majority of share-\nholders cannot control them in the exercise of their powers while they remain in\noffice (Automatic Self Cleansing Filter Syndicate Co Ltd. v Cunningham), so it\nmust be unconstitutional for directors to use their fiduciary powers over the\nshares in the company purely for the purpose of destroying an existing majority,\nor creating a new majority which did not previously exist\u0092 (emphasis added).102\n284 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n98 [1974] AC 821, 835.\n99 ibid 835.\n100 P Davies in Gower and Davies\u0092s Principles of Modern Company Law (7th edn, Sweet &\nMaxwell, London,  2003) 386.\n101 Sealy (n 92) 305.\n102 [1974] AC 821, 837.\nNor does pre-Howard Smith case law view the scope of the doctrine in terms\nof the delegated purposes of specific powers, rather the doctrine is viewed in\nbroader constitutional terms. In Hogg v Cramphorn, Buckley J held that the\ncourts will not \u0091permit directors to exercise powers, which have been dele-\ngated to them by the company in circumstances which put the directors in a\nfiduciary position when exercising those powers, in such a way as to interfere\nwith the exercise by the majority of its constitutional rights\u0092.103\nIn application, therefore, the improper purpose doctrine is not a power-\nspecific rule of construction; rather, it provides a constitutional rule of\nconstruction to determine the extent to which corporate action taken by the\nboard alone may interfere with fundamental shareholder rights\u0097the share-\nholder franchise and the right to alienate one\u0092s shares.104 The doctrine\nprovides a default balance of power settlement between the board and share-\nholder body. The shareholder body may alter this settlement to the extent of\nthe available flexibility provided by the statutory regime. In the quote set\nforth above, whilst Lord Wilberforce holds that it \u0091must be unconstitutional\u0092,\nwhich sounds mandatory, this discussion is the product of what the \u0091constitu-\ntion of a limited company normally provides\u0092 (emphasis added). Also, whilst\nLord Wilberforce indicates that the powers of the board are fixed through his\nreference to Automatic Self-Cleansing,105 it is clear that Automatic Self-\nCleansing and similar cases involve the interpretation of the article delegat-\ning management power to the company. It is equally clear that it is open to\nthe shareholder body to draft such an article in a way that reserves many\npowers, including directing management action, to the shareholder body.106\nAccordingly, to the extent that a corporate constitution provides for a differ-\nent balance of power by containing tailored takeover defences or more\nbroadly authorizing a company to develop and deploy takeover defences pre-\nor post-bid in order to deter, delay or frustrate a bid, the improper purpose\ndoctrine is less likely to invalidate the use of corporate powers as defensive\ntools.\nIt is with regard to the default nature of the improper purpose doctrine that\nunderstanding the doctrine in constitutional rather than individual power terms\nbecomes important. When viewed in constitutional terms the strict default posi-\ntion of the improper purpose doctrine may be dislodged vis-\u00e0-vis the exercise\nof specific powers, for example, the power to issue shares, by a provision else-\nwhere in the articles or by shareholder action. So, for example, a provision in\nthe articles or a shareholder resolution providing the company with authority to\nThe UK\u0092s Takeover Defence Prohibition 285\n103 [1967] Ch 254, 268.\n104 See text to nn 108\u009623.\n105 Automatic Self-Cleansing Filter Syndicate Co Ltd v Cuninghame [1906] 2 Ch 35.\n106 Farrar notes, eg, \u0091that is open to a company to adopt whatever form of management article\nit pleases\u0092.

See also Nolan (n 97) arguing\nthat the doctrine is a presumptive default rule.\nallot warrants in order to put a poison pill in place alters the balance of board\nand shareholder power with regard to defensive action in relation to all powers\neven though specific powers themselves have not been amended to cover\ndefensive action. When viewed as a power-specific rule of construction, in\norder to dislodge the default position the individual power in question would\nhave to be modified to enable defensive action, which, as others have noted,\nis unlikely in relation to public companies.107\n2. The default position\nIn Hogg v Cramphorn,108 the board of Cramphorn Ltd issued additional shares\nto an employee trust formed by the company. As the trustees of the trust were\nthe managing director of the company, the company\u0092s auditor and a company\nemployee, the share issue to the trust ensured that a likely bidder, if success-\nful, would not be able to command a majority of voting power. The board also\nresolved to loan the employee trust the funds to make an offer at the same\nprice offered by the bidder.109 Buckley J struck down the share issue and the\nloan. In relation to the loan, he held that:\nIt was an integral part of a scheme for securing for the directors the support of a\ncontrolling body of votes. The loan was not made with the single-minded, or\neven the primary purpose, of benefiting the company otherwise than by securing\nthat control of the directors or facilitating their securing that control.110\nFor Buckley J, corporate powers to issue shares and to make loans could not\nbe used for the purpose of securing the directors\u0092 control of the company. The\nobjective of securing the directors\u0092 control, however, can cover a wide range\nof good and bad faith reasons for securing such control. In Hogg v Cramphorn,\nthe court held that the directors were acting in good faith and with \u0091honourable\nintentions\u0092. The board claimed that the corporate actions were motivated by\nthe fact that the offer was inadequate and liable to \u0091unsettle\u0092 the company\u0092s\nemployees upon whom the company was \u0091very dependent for its success and\ndevelopment\u0092.111 Buckley J\u0092s judgment makes it clear that these reasons are\ninsufficient to justify such defensive corporate action. However, his judgment\ngoes further. He suggests that there could not be any reason or justification for\nsuch action. Any belief about why such action would protect and benefit the\ncompany is \u0091even if well founded . . . irrelevant\u0092.112\nIn Howard Smith v Ampol Petroleum Ltd, the board of the target company,\nRW Miller (Holdings) Ltd, when faced with an offer for its outstanding shares\n286 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n107 Davies (n 5).\n108 [1967] Ch 254.\n109 At the time the defences were put in place the bid had not formally been made, although the\nbidder had indicated the intended price.\n110 [1967] Ch 254, 270.\n111 ibid 259.\n112 ibid 268.\nfrom Ampol Petroleum Ltd, who together with Bulkships Ltd owned 55 per\ncent of the shares, issued additional shares to Howard Smith Ltd. Although the\nboard claimed that the purpose of the share issue was to raise finance, the court\nfound that the shares had been issued to enable a bid for the company by\nHoward Smith by reducing the percentage shareholding held by Ampol and\nBulkships to a minority holding. Howard Smith was prepared to make an offer\nwhich exceeded the Ampol offer by 10 per cent. The Privy Council held that\n\u0091the issue of shares purely for the purpose of creating voting power has repeat-\nedly been condemned\u0092 and that it is \u0091unconstitutional for directors to use their\nfiduciary powers over the shares in the company purely for the purpose of\ndestroying an existing majority, or creating a new majority which did not\npreviously exist\u0092113 (emphasis added).\nLord Wilberforce\u0092s focus on purpose suggests a distinction, later deployed\nby their Lordships in the context of financial assistance,114 between purpose\nand reason. If the primary objective is to alter the balance of voting power by\nconverting a majority into a minority then it does not matter why you are doing\nthis: reason is irrelevant. This contrasts with dicta from the Canadian decision\nof Teck Corporation Limited v Miller,115 a decision that rejected the approach\ntaken in Hogg v Cramphorn.116 In Teck, the board of Afton Mines Ltd entered\ninto a contract with a third party to develop a copper mine. This type of\ncontract was known in the industry as \u0091the ultimate deal\u0092 and typically\ninvolved a substantial issue of shares to the counterparty. However, the effect\nof this issue was to foreclose a bid for the company from Teck Corp. Berger J\nheld that:\nMy own view is that directors ought to be allowed to consider who is seeking\ncontrol and why. If they believe that there will be substantial damage to the\ncompany if it is taken over, then the exercise of powers to defeat those seeking a\nmajority will not necessarily be improper (emphasis added).117\nInterestingly, in Howard Smith Lord Wilberforce distinguishes Teck in a way\nthat suggests some degree of approval.118 This does not, however, suggest that\nthere is room in Howard Smith for a reason-based analysis of defensive action.\nLord Wilberforce viewed Teck through a non-defensive lens: the company\nwas attempting to strike the best deal for the company; given industry \u0091ulti-\nmate deal\u0092 practice this inevitably involved defeat for Teck if another party\nwas selected.\nMore recent cases, however, have provided support for a more flexible\nreason-based analysis. Cayne v Global Natural Resources PLC119 involved\nthe application of the improper purpose doctrine to the legality of a merger\ninvolving a UK PLC\u0092s US subsidiary. One of the terms of the merger included\nThe UK\u0092s Takeover Defence Prohibition 287\n113 [1974] AC 821, 837. 114 Brady v Brady [1989] AC 755.\n115 [1973] DLR (3d) 288. 116 ibid para 110.\n117 ibid para 109. 118 [1974] AC 821, 837\u00968.\n119 (1982) Unreported LEXIS.\nan issue of shares by the UK company, Global Natural Resources PLC. At the\ntime of the merger a dissident group of shareholders had launched a proxy\ncontest to remove the board of directors. In considering the improper purpose\ndoctrine, Sir Robert Megarry VC noted that the principle set forth in Hogg v\nCramphorn \u0091must not be carried too far\u0092. In considering whether a hypotheti-\ncal company B could issue shares to a third party to ensure that a competitor\nand shareholder of company B could not use its shareholding to the detriment\nof company B, he noted that he saw no reason why the issue of shares \u0091should\nnot be a perfectly proper exercise of the fiduciary powers of the directors of\ncompany B. The object is not to retain control as such, but to prevent company\nB from being reduced to impotence and beggary\u0092. Sir Robert Megarry VC,\nechoing Berger J\u0092s dicta on \u0091substantial damage\u0092 in Teck, recognizes that\nbehind the mantle of retaining control are legitimate and illegitimate reasons.\nHe argues that there are defensive reasons that would justify action that purpo-\nsively alters voting control. Importantly, the threshold for such justifications\nseems to be set very high: Megarry VC refers to avoidance of \u0091impotence and\nbeggary\u0092. It is unclear whether this would include only extreme predatory\nminority shareholder behaviour or would it also, for example, apply to the\nbreak-up of hostile bids which would result in the post-completion sell-off of\nsignificant company assets? Cayne provides limited guidance on the set of\nlegitimate reasons, but it does suggest that there are unlikely to be many.\nIt is also worth noting that the example given by Megarry VC involved the\nissue of shares to alter voting power but did not involve the conversion of a\nmajority voting interest into a minority voting interest. Here we see that there\nis a possible regulatory relationship between legitimate reasons for (or ends\nof) the action and the means used to achieve those ends. Put alternatively,\nthere may be more flexibility on reason for action where the infringement on\nthe shareholder franchise is smaller. This would suggest that the defences and\nreasons to deploy defences that do not directly interfere with the franchise may\nbe viewed more favourably by UK courts. However, Hogg v Cramphorn and\nHoward Smith would not support this position. In Hogg v Cramphorn the\nbidder had not acquired a majority position when the board acted and the court\nalso invalidated the loan to an employee trust on the basis that it was a defen-\nsive measure to retain control. Lord Wilberforce in Howard Smith suggests that\naction intended to inhibit the ability to tender into an offer would be invalid:\n\u0091the right to dispose of shares at a given price is essentially an individual right\nto be exercised on individual decision and on which a majority . . .  is entitled\nto prevail\u0092.120\nAccordingly, the scope for defensive action to be compliant with the\ndefault position provided by the improper purpose doctrine is unclear but\nunlikely to be significant. In the recent case of Criterion Properties Plc v\nStratford Properties LLC,121 the Court of Appeal considered a case involving\n288 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n120 [1974] AC 821, 837\u00968. 121 [2003] 1 WLR 2108.\na takeover defence that did not interfere with the shareholder franchise. The\ndefence involved a put option in a joint venture agreement that would have\nforced the target company to buy out a joint venture partner at an unfavourable\nprice. In this case the Court of Appeal refused to consider the general question\nof whether defending against a predator could be a proper purpose. At best one\ncould say that the court clearly did not feel that this was an area on which\nEnglish law provided a clear position. In the space generated by uncertainty, in\nthe absence of Rule 21, one would expect to see takeover defences deployed by\ncompanies and tested in the courts. However, as noted above, if English courts\nadopted, against the weight of authority, the position in Cayne it is still unlikely\nthat companies would find many legitimate reasons for defensive action.\nAs the improper purpose doctrine\u0092s restrictions only relate to actions whose\nprimary purpose is control-related, the absence of Rule 21 would encourage\ncompanies to search for defences that have a defensive impact but which can\nbe characterized as non-defensive business decisions. This would exclude\npure defences, such as poison pill arrangements, but could cover available\nasset-sale and recapitalization defences if it can be demonstrated that the\nprimary motivation was not a defensive one. As other commentators have\nnoted, however, where such actions are taken in a post-bid setting without a\ncredible record that the actions were contemplated prior to the bid, it may be\nvery difficult for the board to convince a court that the primary purpose was\nnot a defensive one.122 Furthermore, the easier availability of a derivative suit\nfor breach of duty introduced by the Companies Act 2006123 is likely to make\nmost boards wary of taking such action without strong evidentiary support for\nthe claim that the action was not defensively motivated.\nC. Defence Potency in Practice\nThus far the article has considered the formal availability of takeover defences\nand the ability of the board to deploy them in compliance with applicable\ndirectors\u0092 duties. Whilst it has been established that several defences would be\nunavailable, it is clear that in the absence of Rule 21 shareholders could\nprovide the board with pre-bid formal authority to deploy certain tailored\ndefences, such as poison pills, or to use certain corporate powers, for example,\nthe power to sell assets, for defensive effect. Depending on the court\u0092s assess-\nment of the balance of power between the board and the shareholder body in\nlight of the defensive authority given to the board, the exercise of such powers\ncould be compliant with the directors\u0092 duties. However, although formally\navailable and duty compliant, defences will only be used to the extent that they\nare practically effective. If they do not in practice provide management with a\ncredible threat to prevent or delay a bid, their entrenchment effect will be\nminimal, their usefulness in controlling the sale process and their relevance as\nThe UK\u0092s Takeover Defence Prohibition 289\n122 Davies (n 5). 123 Part 11 CA 2006.\na bargaining chip to extract a higher premium will be limited, and they will not\nbe used. This section considers in what ways, and to what extent, available\ndefences would be practically effective.\n1. Poison pills\nIn the United States the most effective and readily available takeover defence\nis the poison pill. The pill in theory allows the board to just say no, prevent-\ning the bidder from ever exceeding the ownership trigger threshold. The pill\u0092s\ndefensive capability pivots on the refusal of the board to grant board approval\nfor the tender offer and to redeem the pill. Accordingly, if the board can be\nreplaced with bidder-friendly directors, then the pill could be redeemed and\nthe bid could proceed. Thus, the logical step for any hostile bidder would be\nto commence a proxy contest at the same time as the offer was launched.\nAlthough there are additional transaction costs associated with a proxy\ncontest, depending on deal size, these are normally not material. A proxy\ncontest involves the holding of a shareholder meeting where the removal of\nthe directors and appointment of new directors is proposed. Management and\nthe bidder compete to obtain proxies from existing shareholders to win the\nshareholder vote. This shifts the regulatory focus away from the creative and\ncomplex arrangements which make up the form and operation of the poison\npill onto the preconditions to a credible threat to replace the board.\nThere are several preconditions to a successful proxy contest and to the\nability credibly to threaten to bring such a contest. First, it must be possible to\nremove a majority of the directors from the board. Ideally this can be done by\nremoving the directors during the course of their term. To do this it must be\npossible under the applicable law to remove a director without cause, that is,\nwithout any evidence of malfeasance.124 In addition, unless the bid is launched\nshortly before the annual general meeting, the shareholders must be able to act\nby consent, that is without a shareholder meeting, or it must be possible to call\nan extraordinary general meeting in which the shareholders will vote on the\nremoval and appointment resolutions. If shareholders are empowered to call\nan interim shareholder meeting and remove the board without cause the\npotency of a pill is reduced to the time it takes successfully to complete a\nproxy contest and the transaction costs associated with that contest.\nUS corporate law is state-based law and so the nature of these basic-rule\nsets varies from state to state. Delaware General Corporation Law, for exam-\nple, provides that these basic rules addressing director removal, term of office,\nthe holding of shareholder meetings and control of the agenda are default\n290 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n124 Ralph Campbell v Loew\u0092s Incorporated 134 A.2d 852 (Delaware, 1957) referring to with\ncause removal as involving \u0091the worst sort of violation of his duty\u0092 (at 857) and charges of \u0091grave\nimpropriety\u0092 (at 859).\nrules. The default position is that directors are elected annually and may be\nremoved without cause.125 The company may, however, elect to have a stag-\ngered board, whereby the directors have three-year terms and one third of the\ndirectors\u0092 terms expire each year. Where a company adopts a staggered board,\nunless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise, directors may only\nbe removed with cause.126 The certificate of incorporation or by-laws may, but\nneed not, provide that the shareholders may call a special meeting (extraordi-\nnary general meeting)127 although if the certificate contains a prohibition on\nshareholders calling special meetings this cannot be amended by the by-\nlaws.128\nAccordingly, Delaware law enables a target, in theory, to disable any cred-\nible proxy contest threat. If a Delaware corporation has a staggered board this\nmeans that, against a determined incumbent board, the target would only be\nable to obtain control of the target board following two AGMs. Even if the bid\nis launched slightly before the first of these AGMs, the bidder will still have\nto wait for at least a year to obtain control of the company. If a company does\nnot have a staggered board but does not allow shareholders to call interim\nmeetings then, depending on the timing of the bid, the bidder may have to wait\nup to a year to launch a proxy contest.\nOne option which might occur to creative legal advisers would be to amend\nthe constitutional documents at the annual general meeting to provide for\nwithout-cause removal, thereby effectively undermining the staggered board.\nIf the provision providing for the staggered board is set forth in the company\u0092s\nby-laws, this would be possible. However, if the staggered board provision is\nset forth in the certificate of incorporation, as it should be in any well-advised\ncorporation, then this would not be possible as under Delaware corporate law\nthe certificate of incorporation can only be amended with the approval of both\nthe board and the shareholders.129\nThe consensus position in the United States\u0092 corporate academy is that\nalone the poison pill is not an effective takeover defence which enables a\ntarget to repel or \u0091just say no\u0092 to a bidder. Its potency is dependent on the fact\nthat board removal and shareholder meeting regulation is default regulation\nthat can be moulded together with an existing or latent130 poison pill to create\nsignificant defensive capability. For scholars who are concerned that\nDelaware takeover law enables management to entrench themselves, their\nfocus of concern is not on the poison pill but on the default background rule\nset. Professor Subramanian puts it as follows:\nThe UK\u0092s Takeover Defence Prohibition 291\n125 Section 141(k) DGCL.\n126 Section 141(d) and 141(k) DGCL.\n127 Section 211(d) DGCL.\n128 The by-laws cannot be inconsistent with the certificate of incorporation (s 109 DGCL). By-\nlaws can be amended unilaterally by the board or the shareholders.\n129 Section 242(b) DGCL.\n130 A poison pill can be put in place by the target after the bid has commenced (Unitrin v\nAmerican General Corp 651 A.2d 1361 (Delaware, 1995)).\nNo academic commentator today (including myself) questions the . . . right of a\ntarget board to maintain a pill for a limited period of time, in order to identify a\nhigher value buyer or to inform shareholders about the bid.131\nFor these scholars, provided that the board does not have the ability to main-\ntain defences for an unlimited period of time,132 then the pill should be avail-\nable to provide management with sufficient time to find a better value third\nparty or a better value restructured bid and to enable an undistorted share-\nholder vote133 on the offer.\nEven where the board is not protected by a staggered board or shareholder\nmeeting provisions, removing the board is a significant step for shareholders\nto take especially when the bid will not be commenced prior to the shareholder\nvote or, where the bid is commenced contemporaneously, the bid is subject to\nadditional conditionality, for example, a material adverse change clause or an\nacquisition threshold of greater than 50 per cent. Shareholders may be satis-\nfied with existing management\u0092s performance and may be concerned that\nshould the bid fail they will be left with management who have a close rela-\ntionship with one minority shareholder group, and are unknown and possibly\nweaker than existing management. Shareholders with these concerns may\nprefer that the board redeems the pill to allow the offer to proceed but remain\nunwilling to remove the board. Such concerns increase the credibility of the\npoison pill threat even without board removal protections.\nAn alternative and less drastic shareholder response to the board\u0092s refusal\nto redeem the pill would be for the shareholder body to instruct the board to\nredeem the pill through a by-law amendment.

This would give\nthe board up to approximately a year, depending on when the bidder makes his intentions clear (L\nBebchuk, J Coates IV, and G Subramanian, \u0091The Powerful Antitakeover Force of Staggered\nBoards: Theory, Evidence and Policy\u0092 (2002) 54 Stanford Law Review 887, 944.\n133 Proponents of the undistorted shareholder vote idea argue that by forcing a proxy contest the\nshareholders have an opportunity to vote on the control transaction separately from tendering their\nshares. This is considered important for two reasons: first, because even though you do not wish to\ntender if you expect other shareholders to tender then you will tender because you will not want to\nremain as a minority shareholder in a company with a substantial majority shareholder who may act\nto the detriment of minority shareholders in ways that are unactionable; second, if most shareholders\ntender the likely consequence is that the shareholder will be squeezed out in any event for equivalent\nconsideration, in which case the refusal to tender has simply cost the shareholder the time value of\nmoney for the period from completion to squeeze out which in the US could take up to three months.\nA separate vote on the deal through a proxy contest is not, however, subject to these tender pressures\n(see Bebchuk (n 13)).\n134 CF Richards and RJ Stearn, \u0091Shareholder By-Laws Requiring Boards of Directors to\nDismantle Rights Plans are Unlikely to Survive Scrutiny Under Delaware Law\u0092 (1999) 54\nBusiness Lawyer 607. In Oklahoma such resolutions have been held to be binding see\nInternational Brotherhood of Teamsters General Fund v Fleming Cos No CIV-96-1650-A (WD\nOklahoma, 1997).\ntion provides otherwise such resolutions are not binding but are only preca-\ntory. Any attempt to amend the certificate of incorporation to provide other-\nwise comes up against the dual board and shareholder approval requirement\nfor certificate amendment.\nThe basic rule flexibility upon which the defensive potency of US poison\npills rests is not available in the UK. Accordingly, even if, in the hypothetical\nabsence of Rule 21, the poison pill defence is formally available, it makes little\npractical sense to attempt to deploy one. The reason for this is that there is\nlimited scope for the board of directors of a UK company to protect them-\nselves from removal or to delay any attempt to remove them. It is a mandatory\nrule of UK company law that all directors regardless of their term in office can\nbe removed by a majority of the votes cast at the meeting.135 No reason or\ncause has to be established to remove a director. It is also a mandatory rule that\nthe directors of a company shall convene an extraordinary general meeting\nwithin 21 days of the receipt of a requisition to do so by members represent-\ning at least one-tenth of the paid-up voting share capital of the company.136 If\nthe board does not do so the members who made the requisition may call a\nmeeting themselves and have their reasonable expenses reimbursed by the\ncompany.137 Accordingly, UK company law always enables shareholders to\nmeet outside of the AGM. If the meeting is brought to remove a director then\nspecial notice is required, which means the company must receive notice of\nthe intention to remove the director 28 days before the meeting at which such\na resolution will be moved and the shareholders must receive notice of the\nresolution at least 21 days before the meeting.138 Accordingly, where the\nboard refuses to call a requisitioned meeting an efficient hostile bidder can\nremove a resistant board within 42 days.139 The board, however, could slightly\nprolong this period by actually calling the meeting in accordance with the Act\non the 21st day following the requisition for a date 28 days after the date of\nthe notice convening the meeting.140 This would extend the removal period to\n49 days. If the proxy context is commenced at the same time as the takeover\noffer subject to pill redemption conditionality then the offer will only be 28\ndays longer than the shortest time frame within which an offer could be\ncompleted and in fact will be similar in length to the time period it takes to\ncomplete many takeovers.141\nThe UK\u0092s Takeover Defence Prohibition 293\n135 Section 303 CA (s 168 CA 2006). 136 Section 368(2) CA (s 303(2) CA 2006).\n137 Section 368(4) and (6) CA (s 305 CA 2006).\n138 Section 379 CA 1985 (s 312 CA 2006\u0097note that s 312 reduces the shareholder notice period\nto 14 days).\n139 21 days from T1 (date of requisition) waiting for the directors to call the requisitioned meet-\ning plus 21 days notice to the general meeting under the special notice requirements. The 28-day\nspecial notice period to the company is satisfied if given at T1. Please note that the removal period\nwill be reduced to 35 days when the 2006 Act comes in to force as the shareholder notice period\nfor director removal is reduced from 21 to 14 days.\n140 Section 368(8) of the 1985 Act and section 304(1)(b) of the 2006 Act require that the meet-\ning be called for a date not later than 28 days after the date of the notice of the meeting.\n141 Rule 30.1 Takeover Code (2006) requires that the offer document should normally be posted\nIf concern about removal of the board and subsequent bid failure under-\nmined the likely success of the proxy contest, under UK company law the\nshareholder body could simply instruct the board to redeem the pill. Currently\nthe default position under Article 70 of Table A provides that the powers of\nthe board to manage the company are subject to any direction given by special\nresolution: 75 per cent of the shareholders voting at a general meeting. That is,\nin contrast to most US state corporate law, shareholder directions are binding\nnot precatory. To the extent that such an option is foreclosed by tailored arti-\ncles, direction can be given by the same proportion of votes by an amendment\nto the articles by special resolution. For such resolutions 21 days\u0092 notice is\nrequired, which means that the minimum time period required to force a\nredemption of the pill would be 42 days142 if the board failed to call a requi-\nsitioned meeting and 49 days if they called a requisitioned meeting for a date\n28 days after the date on which the meeting is convened.143 Accordingly, in\nthe UK in the absence of Rule 21 it would make no practical sense to develop\nand deploy a poison pill.\n2. Business combination defences\nBusiness combination defences usually contain a board approval mechanism\nthat triggers the defence only in relation to bidders that cross the specified\nownership threshold without approval. This way the defence is only deployed\nagainst unwelcome suitors. The act of refusing to approve a bidder would\namount to frustrating action prohibited by Rule 21. However, as with the\npoison pill, even in the absence of Rule 21, this defence would be wholly inef-\nfective in the UK due to the basic background rule set that allows the share-\nholders to remove the board or instruct the board to resolve that the bidder is\nan approved bidder.\n3. Restructuring and asset sale defences\nAs we have seen, in the absence of Rule 21, the scope for a board of a UK\ncompany to craft a restructuring or asset sale defence is restricted. Assuming\n294 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\nwithin 28 days of the announcement of a firm intention to make an offer. Rule 31.1 requires that\nan offer must be open \u0091for at least 21 days following the date on which the offer document is\nposted\u0092.\n142 The 2006 Act reduces the notice period for meetings at which special resolutions are moved\nto 14 days, which would reduce the minimum time period to force a redemption to 35 days. See\nss 283 and 307 CA 2006.\n143 As under the UK Takeover Code, any successful bidder is required to offer an extended offer\nperiod of 14 days for those shareholders or refuse to tender initially (Rule 31.4 Takeover Code\n(2006)), there is no distortion in the tendering process (see n 133) which a proxy contest vote or\npill redemption resolution would remedy. Any shareholder who does not tender in the initial offer\nhas no concern about being left behind as a minority shareholder if the bid is successful nor any\nsignificant concern about lost value as a result of later payment; he simply accepts the offer after\nthe initial successful offer closes.\nthat board action is compliant with the proper purpose doctrine, the board\ncould increase leverage and issue an interim dividend provided that there are\nsufficient distributable profits, or sell assets of up to 25 per cent of company\nvalue. It could not, without contemporaneous shareholder approval, issue a\nsubstantial block of shares to a friendly third party,144 commence a share buy-\nback or sell assets worth more than 25 per cent of company value. This does,\nhowever, leave significant scope for defensive action. If the bidder is a highly\nleveraged bidder, as is typical with a private equity bidder, increasing lever-\nage and issuing an interim dividend could render the bid infeasible. Asset sales\nof 25 per cent or less of the value of the company or the threat to negotiate\nsuch sales could be a particularly effective defence against a break-up bid that\nis premised on the idea that the company is worth less than the sum of its parts.\nIn such a case the defensive threat is simply to put the break-up process into\noperation pre-bid in order to realize higher value for the shareholders. The\nasset-sale threat is also available in the context of a bid that is not intending to\nbreak up the company post-completion. The credibility of such a threat may,\ndepending on the circumstances, be constrained by the interdependence of the\nassets whereby the sale of the prized asset would destroy value in the rest of\nthe company\u0092s business.\nThese defences could be used to offer the shareholder body an alternative\nto the bid, as a bargaining chip with the bidder, or as a mechanism for obtain-\ning more time to control the sale process. They could also be used by manage-\nment to protect their jobs in the face of an excellent value offer. However,\nthere is good reason to doubt that in practice the available entrenchment effect\nof these defences is significant in the UK. It is certainly less than it would be\nin the United States. Management of a US company protected by a compliant\nand staggered board145 can incur the wrath of shareholders by repelling a bid\nand face no serious threat of subsequent removal in the short to medium term.\nThis is not the result of the collective action problem but rather a result of the\nfact that it will take two proxy contests and over a year at least to obtain\ncontrol of the board\u0097time in which shareholders\u0092 fury and focus is likely to\nwane. In the UK a board that hypothetically deploys or threatens to deploy the\nasset-sale defence to repel a premium bid has no such post-bid protection. The\nboard could, in theory, be removed within 49 days. The collective action prob-\nlem provides a protective cushion for management, but the more self-inter-\nested the action appears the greater the likelihood that in collective outrage it\nmay be overcome.146 Furthermore, this different background rule set enhances\nThe UK\u0092s Takeover Defence Prohibition 295\n144 Although formally it is possible that the shareholders could provide a pre-bid rolling large\npre-emption waiver, in practice, we see that the pre-emption guidelines mean that such waivers\nare for low single digit percentages of outstanding shares. See text to nn 52\u00965.\n145 As of 1998 60 per cent of US publicly traded companies had staggered boards (Investor\nResponsibility Research Center, Corporate Takeover Defenses (1998)).\n146 See, eg, the proxy contest to remove the entire board of Tace PLC in 1992 organized by\nNorwich Union. See generally, Black and Coffee (n 41) 2042\u00966.\nthe bargaining position of investors when they attempt to exert pressure for\nchange. In the UK such investors have an immediate and plausible big gun147\nto back up their demands.148 In the United States, where a company\u0092s board is\neffectively staggered, pressure is not backed up by the realistic possibility of\nsanction. In the post-Enron environment UK institutional investors have\ndemonstrated their increasing willingness to exert pressure when dissatisfied\nwith board behaviour over appointments,149 remuneration150 or strategy.151\nAlthough it remains clear that the costs of activism prevent hands-on opera-\ntional monitoring by institutional investors, these investors are willing to act\nin relation to high profile discrete issues that are framed in terms of poor\ngovernance or managerial self-interest. Using defences without a strong busi-\nness case which the shareholder body would view as legitimate would quickly\nbe framed in terms of entrenchment which could ignite institutional investor\nactivity. Furthermore, if defensive activity risks being framed in entrenchment\nterms it necessarily risks damage to the manager\u0092s reputation. Should she be\nremoved, her value in the job market will be much diminished. It would, there-\nfore, be irrational for management to abuse their corporate power for incum-\nbency purposes if the act of abuse both substantially increases the likelihood\nof their removal and damages their reputation in the job market. In practice,\ntherefore, the entrenchment effect of the asset sale defence or the leveraged\ninterim dividend are significantly curbed by the UK\u0092s basic company law\nrules, the potential for institutional investor activism, and the market in\nmanagerial reputation.\nIII. JUSTIFYING LIMITS ON CONTRACTUAL FREEDOM\nSection II demonstrates that if we posit the abolition of Rule 21 then, subject\n296 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n147 Paul Davies notes that the power to remove the board under UK law is the basis for the view\nof Bob Monks (vice-chairman of Hermes Lens asset management) that the UK is \u0091\u0093easily the\nworld leader\u0094 in the accountability of managers to investors\u0092 (P Davies, \u0091Shareholder Value: A\nNew Standard for Company Conduct? A (British) Common Law View\u0092 (working paper on file\nwith the author)).\n148 For examples of where the threat of proxy contest resulted in board capitulation see the\nremoval of the CEO of Coffee Republic following a meeting called by shareholders to remove the\nCEO (see \u0091Shareholders Oust Coffee Republic Founder\u0092 Financial Times (London, 21 Oct 2006)\n18). See also, the removal of the CEO of Brown and Jackson Plc and the replacement of the CEO\nand a majority of the board in Spring Ram Plc (see Black and Coffee (n 41)).\n149 See, eg, the proposed appointment and withdrawal within a week of Sir Ian Prosser as\nChairman of Sainsbury Plc (see: \u0091Investor Fury at Sainsbury Rejig\u0092 Financial Times (London, 11\nFeb 2004)).\n150 See investor \u0091anger\u0092 in relation to the approval of Sainsbury\u0092s 2003 remuneration report\n(\u0091Sainsbury\u0092s board set for lifeline: family to back controversial remuneration report\u0092 Financial\nTimes (London, 12 July 2004)) and investor\u0092s responses to Vodafone bonuses in 2006 (\u0091Vodafone\ninvestors prepare for battle over bonus plans\u0092 Financial Times (London, 19 Apr 2006)).\n151 See \u0091Investors unite to confront Vodafone\u0092 Financial Times (London, 10 June 2006); \u0091Vodafone\nunder pressure on strategy amid huge write-down\u0092 Financial Times (London, 29 May 2006).\nto leveraged interim dividends and less-than-25 per cent asset sales, there\nwould still be no post-bid ETDs available to the board of a UK target without\ncontemporaneous shareholder approval. Importantly, the dividend and asset-\nsale exceptions are only available where prior to the bid the company\u0092s consti-\ntution alters the default balance of power provided by the improper purpose\ndoctrine either explicitly by providing that corporate powers can be used for\ndefensive purposes or implicitly by providing for a tailored takeover defence,\nsuch as a poison pill.152 Accordingly, the only post-bid director-controlled\nETDs that are blocked by Rule 21 alone are defences that a pre-bid share-\nholder body would have elected to put in place. Recent US evidence that the\nlarge majority of companies going public have potent complementary\ndefences suggests that, given the option, sophisticated UK shareholders, such\nas private equity investors, who control a company prior to its initial public\noffering (IPO), would elect to make such ETDs available to the board. Whilst\nin the US institutional investors are vocal and active in their opposition to the\nmid-steam adoption of takeover defences through charter amendment and the\nadoption of poison pills without shareholder approval,153 they are involved in\nboth the buy and sell side154 of IPOs by companies with constitutions which\nprovide for staggered boards and prevent shareholders from calling a special\nmeeting or acting by consent. Of the 6000 US companies going public\nbetween 1987 and 1999, 50 per cent had staggered boards. However, of those\ngoing public in 1999, 82 per cent had staggered boards.155 In 1998 51.2 per\ncent of companies going public prevented shareholders from calling interim\nmeetings.156\nMuch hand-wringing has taken place in US corporate academic circles\ntrying to explain this phenomenon.157 Is this evidence that potent defences are\nvalue-maximizing or is the price of the shares subject to a discount to take\nThe UK\u0092s Takeover Defence Prohibition 297\n152 Although, as demonstrated above poison pills are in themselves practically ineffective they\nindicate an intention to alter the balance of power between the shareholders and the board.\n153 Klausner summarizes research by the Investor Responsibility Research Center (Investor\nResponsibility Research Center, Voting by Institutional Investors on Corporate Governance\nIssues 5 (2001)) regarding US institutional investor voting practices as follows: \u009159% [of the\nsurvey respondents] consistently vote against management proposals to adopt classified [stag-\ngered] boards, and 65% vote in favor of shareholder proposals to repeal classified boards.\nInstitutions oppose management control over poison pills as well, with 72% of survey respondents\nvoting in favor of shareholder proposals that ask management to submit pills to shareholder vote\nbefore adoption\u0092 M Klausner, \u0091Institutional Investors, Private Equity and Anti-takeover Protection\nat the IPO Stage\u0092 (2003) 152 University of Pennsylvania Law Review 755, 760. He also notes that\nthe institutional investor opposition to the mid-stream adoption of staggered boards has meant that\nmanagement realizes that \u0091there is no point in even asking shareholders to support a [staggered]\nboard\u0092 (758).\n154 eg through their investments in private equity limited partnerships.\n155 Klausner (n 153) 763\u00964.\n156 Note, however, that the prohibition on calling an interim meeting is defensively less impor-\ntant when directors can only be removed with cause, which is normally the case when the\ncompany has a staggered board.\n157 See Klausner (n 153) 766\u009684.\naccount of the negative value effects of these defences?158 What is clear,\nhowever, is that providing companies with defences is the preference of\nsophisticated shareholders that retain a significant stake in the company.\nWhilst non-shareholder value explanations of this have been proffered159 one\ncannot discount the possibility that in some cases owners want to protect the\ncompany from takeover to ensure that their remaining stake in the company is\nnot cashed out by a future bidder who offers a premium that does not reflect\nthe company\u0092s long-term value. Whether or not as an empirical matter this\nturns out to be the case is irrelevant to the shareholders\u0092 view and preference\nat the time of the IPO. Any prohibition of shareholders\u0092 contractual expression\nof such preferences requires a persuasive rationale.160 This section evaluates\nthe available rationales.\nA. Post-bid Votes and Shareholder Sovereignty\nProponents of the non-frustration principle could argue that it does not fore-\nclose using an available defence as any such defence can be implemented with\npost-bid shareholder approval. This is unpersuasive. Requiring post-bid rather\nthan pre-bid approval can alter the effectiveness of the defence. With an asset-\nsale defence, for example, in order for the defence to be credible the target\nmust be able to negotiate a sale with a third party interested in those assets.\nCarrying out legal and financial due diligence on the assets as well as negoti-\nating their sale can be very costly. There are also reputation costs for a third-\nparty purchaser who fails to complete the purchase. Any third party\napproached to consider the purchase of such assets will be wary of incurring\nthose costs when the target may well be using the third party simply to extract\na higher premium from the bidder. Concern about the costs of an unsuccess-\nful transaction will be heightened if a shareholder vote could veto the sale. A\npotential third-party purchaser will be aware that even if the asset sale offers\nbetter value for the particular asset, shareholders may still prefer to exit their\nentire investment. Post-bid shareholder approval for an asset sale may well,\ntherefore, undermine the asset-sale defence. Accordingly, a post-bid share-\nholder approval process does not provide a rationale for removing pre-bid\napproval of a director-controlled post-bid asset-sale defence.\nProponents of the non-frustration principle view the principle as the logical\noutcome of a commitment to shareholder sovereignty: shareholders decide\nwhether to sell their shares or whether or not to approve proposed defensive\n298 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n158 Debevoise & Plimpton\u0092s Private Equity Report (2003) 3, notes that \u0091underwriters have\nfrequently advised that including a normal set of shark repellants\u0096\u0096including a poison pill\u0096\u0096will\nnot harm the marketability of the IPO shares\u0092.\n159 See Klausner (n 153) 766\u009684.\n160 This rationale demand also applies to the mandatory background rule of UK company law\nanalysed in this article, however, the focus of this article remains on Rule 21.\naction.161 As the Winter Report puts it: \u0091shareholders should be able to decide\nfor themselves\u0092.162 This is misleading. Shareholders may rationally choose to\nconstrain future shareholder rights by providing for a different balance of\npower between the board and the shareholders. Posit a small shareholder\ngroup who own and actively control a close company. The shareholders elect\nto take the company public and realize some of their capital gains but intend\nto maintain a substantial holding in the company and to continue to be opera-\ntionally active. They are concerned that new shareholders, no matter how\nsophisticated, will not appreciate the long-term value of the company when\nfaced with a well-timed premium offer and realize that if such future share-\nholders are inclined to accept an offer then they will not authorize post-bid\ndefensive action. A rational shareholder group with this concern would\nprovide the board with as much defensive capability as English law allows. If\nthis choice is not available because it is blocked by the non-frustration princi-\nple, shareholder sovereignty is undermined. In contrast, the sovereignty of\nshareholders who purchase shares in a company where post-bid defensive\naction is authorized ex-ante is unaffected if their opportunity to accept or\nreject a bid is inhibited by board action; the price they paid took account of\nthis risk.\nB. The Collective Action Problem\nA second rationale for foreclosing this defensive flexibility is a paternalistic\none based around the potential for management to exploit the collective action\nproblem. The argument is that if this option is made available then inactive\nshareholders who have poor financial incentives to pay attention to the\ncompany\u0092s activities, including amending its constitution, may well approve\ndefensive flexibility without giving adequate consideration to its potential\nnegative effects during a future takeover bid. This contrasts with an approval\nrequest during an actual bid, where an offer is likely to ignite shareholders\u0092\nattention to the actual effects of a proposed defence. In the context of takeover\ndefences this is a weak argument. Even though institutional shareholders may\nnot have large enough holdings to be hands-on monitors of corporate action it\nis clear that in relation to what are regarded as key governance or value issues\nthey actively mould corporate action.163 The most obvious example of this\nbehaviour in the UK is the Pre-emption Group that informally and effectively\nrestricts pre-emption right waivers.164 Evidence from the US also shows that\nThe UK\u0092s Takeover Defence Prohibition 299\n161 See references set forth in nn 6 and 7.\n162 See (n 9).\n163 See text to nn 146\u009651.\n164 Generally on the Pre-emption Group see <http:\/\/www.pre-emptiongroup.org.uk\/>. The Pre-\nemption Group\u0092s Principles provide for routine institutional investor support for the disapplica-\ntion of pre-emption rights provided that the annual disapplication does not amount to more than 5\nper cent of the ordinary share capital of the company or 7.5 per cent in a three-year rolling period.\nonce aware of the apparent negative implications of takeover defences institu-\ntional shareholders can act to inhibit them. Witness, for example, the inability\nof companies without staggered boards to try and obtain shareholder approval\nfor an amendment to the constitution to introduce one. Institutional share-\nholder opposition has resulted in a sharp decline in the number of companies\nrequesting such approval.165 Given the widespread sense amongst UK\ninvestor circles that takeover defences are value-destructive, one would expect\nUK institutional shareholders to be similarly circumspect. Accordingly, even\nif available, defensive mid-stream constitutional amendments are not subject\nto a collective action problem.\nThere is, however, considerable scope for introducing such defences at the\nIPO stage. As noted above, recent US evidence shows that most companies\ngoing public contain ETDs including staggered boards. However, purchasing\nshares in companies containing these defences does not generate the same\npaternalistic fervour as mid-stream constitutional amendments. Shares are a\npackage of rights set forth in the constitutional documents. If you do not like\nthe rights you can elect not to buy or to buy at a discount to reflect what you\nconsider to be the value-negative rights. However, you can have no complaint\nabout buying the rights if, aware of the defences, you purchase without\ndiscount166 or discount to take account of those rights. It could be the case that\ninvestors do not pay attention to or fail to take account of such rights: that is,\nin relation to certain provisions set forth in companies\u0092 constitutions the capi-\ntal markets are inefficient.167 But even if this is the case it is not clear why the\nlaw should paternalistically protect investors who are perfectly capable of\nreading about and understanding such rights at the time of purchase.\nC. Agency and Incompetence Costs\nA third justification for Rule 21 foreclosing the limited defensive flexibility\nleft open by English company law focuses on the effect that takeover defences\nhave on the operation of the market for corporate control, and the role of the\nmarket for corporate control in restraining agency costs and what I shall call\nincompetence costs.\nAgency costs are the costs that shareholders bear as a result of the fact that\nmanagers\u0092 interests are not wholly aligned with shareholders\u0092 interests.\nExamples of these costs include, amongst others: the costs incurred as a result\nof action that benefits managers at the shareholders\u0092 expense, such as shirking,\nself-dealing and excessive perquisites; the costs of attempting to align\nmanagers\u0092 interests with those of shareholders through remuneration; and the\ncosts incurred through monitoring to prevent self-interested behaviour.\n300 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n165 See n 153. 166 See n 158.\n167 Considering such an a possibility see: R Daines and M Klausner, \u0091Do IPO Charters\nMaximze Firm Value? Antitakeover Defences in IPOs\u0092 (2002) 17 Journal of Law, Economics and\nOrganization 83, 113; Klausner (n 153) 780\u00962, in particular, n 88.\nIncompetence costs are the costs that shareholders bear as a result of poor\nmanagement decisions untainted by self-interest. In theory the market for\ncorporate control can check both types of costs. Managers who use corporate\npower to directly or indirectly benefit themselves or shirk and prioritize their\npersonal life over their professional obligations lower the value of the\ncompany and its share price. This value delta represents an opportunity for\npotential bidders and a threat to incumbent management\u0092s employment.\nIncompetent management similarly lowers the value of the shares and repre-\nsents an opportunity for potential bidders. A premium paid to shareholders\nmay, amongst others, represent a portion of this value delta. The market for\ncorporate control thereby both disincentivizes agency and incompetence costs\nand ensures that existing shareholders do not bear the full extent of these costs.\nAccording to this theory, the more active the market for corporate control the\nless scope for agency costs and the lower the likelihood that incompetent\nmanagement survives. Anything that gets in the way of the market for corpo-\nrate control activity, such as takeover defences, necessarily increases the scope\nfor unsanctioned agency and incompetence costs.168\nIn analysing this justification for the non-frustration principle we need to\nunderstand the extent to which there is an agency cost or an incompetence cost\nproblem in the UK that is not controlled by other mechanisms; if these costs\nare already controlled then the market for corporate control will be less signif-\nicant or even superfluous in this regard. Furthermore, we need to understand\nwhether non-controlled agency or incompetence costs are likely to be of such\nmagnitude that they trigger a market for corporate control activity: do the\nagency or incompetence cost savings of replacing management exceed the\ntransaction costs of taking over the firm?\nIn the UK the case has not been made that agency costs require the market\nfor corporate control to keep them in check. UK executive remuneration has\nincreased markedly over recent years and is increasingly reliant on performance-\nbased compensation.169 This in itself may be indicative of self-interested exec-\nutive action although their value itself is in most cases immaterial when\ncompared to company value. As is well known, increasing performance-based\ncompensation may, however, be a more cost-effective way of ensuring that\ncorporate actions are not tainted with self-interest. The scope for management\nto act in their own interests apart from directly or indirectly increasing remu-\nneration and perquisites is limited in the UK. A strict duty of loyalty creates\nlimited scope for personal exploitation of opportunities that would be of inter-\nest to the company without shareholder approval.170 Whilst the directors can\nThe UK\u0092s Takeover Defence Prohibition 301\n168 See Easterbrook and Fischel (n 11).\n169 See MJ Conyon and GV Sadler, \u0091How Does US and UK CEO Pay Measure Up?\u0092 (2005),\nworking paper on file with the author.\n170 Bhullar v Bhullar [2003] EWCA CIV 424.

Fear of losing one\u0092s job will not enable an individual\nto exceed his capability constraint. However, individuals may fail to make the\nmost of their ability for reasons that do not fit within the label of shirking.\nIncentives matter for getting the most out of management. There is, however,\nno reason to think that the abstract possibility of a takeover bid is more likely\nto maximize (within an individual\u0092s capacity constraint) competence than the\nmore immediate financial incentives of performance-related pay. With regard\nto replacing failing management, there is evidence that in the UK boards will\nact to replace failing management. This is particularly apparent in the most\npoorly managed companies.173 The increasing independence of UK boards\nfollowing recent amendments to the Combined Code should enhance such\ndiscipline.174 However, if performance is not viewed as poor enough for the\nboard to act or if the apparent independence of the board is subverted, there\nremains, in theory, an important role for the market for corporate control to\nplay.\nThe moot question is whether existing agency and incompetence costs are\nsignificant enough to trigger takeover activity and, if they are, whether the\ncontrol market in practice appears to be responsive to these costs. Recently\nBlanaid Clarke has argued that \u0091most instances of self-dealing will not result\nin a significant enough discount in the company\u0092s share price to justify the\nsubstantial takeover premium that normally prevails\u0092.175 This echoes earlier\nUS work by John Coffee who concluded that \u0091the level of efficiency is either\n\u0093not extreme enough to justify the necessary premium or so extreme as to\nsurpass the offeror\u0092s level of risk aversion\u0094\u0092.176 Empirical evidence in the UK\nis consistent with this position. Frank and Mayer\u0092s study of 80 hostile bids in\nthe UK between 1985 and 1986 found that there was \u0091no evidence of either\nhigh bid premiums or poor pre-bid performance when takeovers involve\nmanagerial control changes\u0092.

Value Destruction\nIf takeover defences destroy shareholder value then they externalize a cost on\nthe economy as a whole. Their prohibition is then viewed as a justifiable inter-\nvention into the freedom of contract in the interests of maximizing social\nwelfare. On the other hand, if takeover defences make a positive contribution\nto shareholder value then one would have to look elsewhere to rationalize their\nprohibition. The US debate pivots around value: those opposed to defences\nseek to demonstrate negative value implications; those in favour search for\nindications of value creation. In assessing the value implications of defences\ncommentators have focused on: the reaction of capital markets to the adoption\nof defences; the effect of defences on takeover activity; the return on capital\nfor rejected bids compared to the market as a whole; the operational perfor-\nmance of companies with takeover defences; and the premiums received by\nshareholders in companies with and without defences. Recently, Blanaid\nClarke in her review of the literature concludes that:\nWhile the empirical evidence is often contradictory, the majority of evidence\nwould appear to support the hypothesis that defensive actions reduce shareholder\nvalue and are best explained as a device for management entrenchment.178\nThis article submits that the literature does not provide any such clarity regard-\ning the relationship between value and takeover defences; there is no majority\nposition. John Coates has clearly demonstrated that much of the empirical\nwork on the value implications of takeover defences is deeply flawed.179 In\nrelation to event studies that attempt to isolate the value effects of poison pill\nadoption on a company\u0092s share price,180 he concludes, among other things:\nthat the studies are inconsistent from study to study and inconsistent over time;\nthat they suffer from methodological problems in identifying the data set; that\nearlier studies\u0092 negative value findings may be a function of markets misesti-\nmating the implications of what was then an innovative defence; that the stud-\nies fail to take account of the fact that a pill can be adopted at any time, so that\na company without a pill is no different defensively (ignoring the interaction\nwith other defences) than a company with a pill; and that the studies fail to\ntake account of how pills interact with other defences. In relation to event\nstudies of takeover defences included in the company\u0092s constitution, he\nThe UK\u0092s Takeover Defence Prohibition 303\n177 J Franks and C Mayer, \u0091Hostile Takeovers in the UK and the Correction of Managerial\nFailure\u0092 (1996) 40 Journal of Financial Economics 163, 180.\n178 Clarke (n 175) 362.\n179 JC Coates IV, \u0091The Contestability of Corporate Control: A Critique of the Scientific\nEvidence\u0092 (1999) Harvard John M Olin Center for Law, Economics and Business Discussion\nPaper No 265 (available at SSRN <http:\/\/ssrn.com\/abstract=173628>).\n180 ibid 11\u009629.\nconcludes that the results are mixed and that insignificant results predominate.\nMore fundamentally, he observes that studying the value implications of these\ndefences makes little sense in an environment that permits poison pills that\nthereby render these other defences of little consequence. In relation to pill and\ncharter amendment event studies he concludes that the problems he identifies\n\u0091reduce the value of prior event studies to the vicinity of zero\u0092.181 The \u0091prin-\nciple mystery about event studies of takeover defences\u0092 he submits, is \u0091how\nresearchers managed to find any results, or why anyone took those results seri-\nously\u0092.182 In relation to studies of takeover premiums, he notes that the stud-\nies looking at the relationship between pill adoption and takeover premiums\nconsistently demonstrate that those companies with pills obtain higher premi-\nums in subsequent bids. This is usually explained by the increased negotiating\npower that such defences give the board. However, he argues that there is no\nnecessary causal connection between the pill and the increased premium. The\nreason for this is that, as noted above, as a company can adopt a pill at any\ntime there is, in pill terms, no difference between a company with a pill and\none without a pill. In relation to market for corporate control activity, Coates\u0092\nreview of the evidence concludes that pills alone do not deter bids. More\nrecent work supports this assessment.183\nSome support for the position that defences destroy value is found in\nwork looking at the effect of reorganization defences. Dann and DeAngelo\nin a survey of hostile takeovers from 1962 to 1983 found significant nega-\ntive stock market returns at the time a defensive restructuring was\nannounced.184 One would not, however, wish to place excessive weight on\nthese findings. The sample was small and the time period for analysing the\nreturns does not extend beyond the announcement date. Whilst the authors\nconclude that their findings are consistent with the entrenchment hypothesis\nthey acknowledge that it is not the only possible explanation.185 Others have\nargued that companies that adopt defences have poorer operating perfor-\nmance.186 More recently, a study by Danielson and Karpoff found that\n\u0091operating performance generally improves during the five-year period\nfollowing pill adoption\u0092 which is \u0091inconsistent with the view that pills\ndegrade performance\u0092.187\n304 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n181 ibid 38.\n182 ibid 69.\n183 RA Heron and E Lie, \u0091On the Use of Poison Pills and Defensive Payouts by Takeover\nTargets\u0092 (2006) 79 Journal of Business 1783.\n184 L Dann and H DeAngelo, \u0091Corporate Financial Policy and Corporate Control\u0092 (1988) 20\nJournal of Financial Economics 87.\n185 ibid 114.\n186 GA Jarrell, JA Brickley, and JA Netter, \u0091The Market for Corporate Control: the Empirical\nEvidence Since 1980\u0092 (1988) 2 Journal of Economic Perspectives 49.

In their sample of\n92 hostile bids, 60 per cent of the 45 companies with an ESB and a pill\nremained independent compared to 34 per cent of targets without an ESB.190\nFurthermore, they concluded that the returns of the companies who remained\nindependent as compared to companies sold to either the initial bidder or a\nthird party bidder were 36 per cent less in the short run (9 months) and 55 per\ncent less in the long run (30 months).191 Their conclusions, however, are not\nuncontroversial. Most importantly, opponents argue that the ESB\u0096pill combi-\nnation creates a powerful bargaining chip that results in increased returns in\nthe more numerous friendly deals which dwarf lower returns for shareholders\nin companies that deploy the defences to block a deal.192 Bebchuk, Coates and\nSubramanian have attempted to counter this with limited empirical evidence\nthat friendly deals with ESB\u0096pill targets do not generate positive abnormal\nreturns.193 By the authors\u0092 admission this empirical rebuttal is tentative given\nthe small sample size. More importantly, it is logically inconsistent:\nIt seems an impossible feat of logic to argue, on the one hand, that ESBs repre-\nsent \u0091a serious impediment to the hostile bidder seeking to gain control over the\n[incumbent directors] objections\u0092 and are \u0091extremely potent as an antitakeover\ndevice\u0092, while at the same time arguing that, on the other hand, boards are unable\nto use this extremely potent force to extract a better price from any genuinely\ninterested suitor.194\nSubramanian has attempted to rebut this argument arguing that in practice the\nscope for target management to deploy this bargaining power may be limited\ndue to, for example, the existence of other similar purchase options for the\nbidder or the absence of plausible other buyers.195 However, whilst\nSubramanian demonstrates that these case-contingent factors can affect the\nvalue range in which bargaining can take place, his analysis demonstrates\nnecessarily that there will be cases in which the bargaining range is broad and\nThe UK\u0092s Takeover Defence Prohibition 305\n188 An effective staggered board is one that cannot be removed by unilateral shareholder action.\nFor example, a staggered board would be ineffective if provided for by the by-laws, which can\nusually be amended by the board or by the shareholders acting alone (s 109 DGCL), rather than\nin the charter which requires board and shareholder approval (242(b) DGCL).\n189 Bebchuk et al (n 132).\n190 ibid 930.\n191 ibid 936.\n192 eg see M Gordon, \u0091Takeover Defenses Work.

The overall value\nimplications of the ESB\u0096pill combination, therefore, remain unresolved.\nThe value debate in the United States, therefore, does not provide Rule 21\nwith a convincing existential rationale. It remains a moot point whether\ntakeover defences generate or destroy shareholder value. More problematic for\nRule 21 is that the limited US evidence of value destruction is either inapplic-\nable or less relevant to the UK. Bebchuk, Coates and Subramanian\u0092s evidence\nthat ESB\u0096pill combinations are value-decreasing does not travel to the UK. In\nthe UK staggered boards and with-cause removal of directors are not avail-\nable, and this, as demonstrated above, substantially strips the pill of its\npotency. Evidence that reorganization defences are value-decreasing should\nalso be viewed as context-specific. Several of the restructurings studied by\nDann and DeAngelo would not be available in the UK without ex-post share-\nholder approval because they involved share issues and buy-backs, and dives-\ntures and acquisitions that would have exceeded the UK\u0092s 25 per cent\nthreshold.196 Furthermore, as noted above, the possible removal threat post-\nfailed bid may well have been much lower in the US cases studied than it\nwould have been in the UK due to the existence in the subject firms of stag-\ngered boards and with-cause removal. If, as Dann and DeAngelo suggest,\nentrenchment does explain the negative returns in the reorganization cases\nwhich they analyse, it is not clear that the different set of UK background rules\nwould not control any entrenchment temptation. Indeed it is very plausible that\nin the UK legal environment any value-decreasing entrenchment effects of\nETDs are neutralized by the mandatory set of background rules, allowing\nvalue-positive effects to dominate. Unfortunately this hypothesis is not\ntestable so long as Rule 21 is in force.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nIn the contemporary company law setting in which UK public companies\noperate, Rule 21 has a very limited impact. If the regulator\u0092s policy goal is the\nprohibition of post-bid board-controlled takeover defences deployed without\npost-bid shareholder approval, it has practical effect only in relation to a\nlimited set of reorganization and asset sale defences and only where the\ncompany has a constitutional settlement that allows the board to use corporate\npowers to defensive effect. But as has been established, the same background\ncompany law rules which would disable more potent defences such as poison\npills ensure that available defences would only be used where management\nwere convinced that the shareholder body, or at least the active members of the\nshareholder body, accepted the legitimacy of such action, even if they would\nprefer to accept the offer. Accordingly, in the absence of the non-frustration\n306 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n196 See Dann and DeAngelo (n 184) 116\u009626.\nprohibition not only would post-bid, director-controlled ETDs require pre-bid\nshareholder consent but when made available there is limited scope to use\nthem for entrenchment purposes. If this is the case Rule 21 struggles to ratio-\nnalize its existence. This article has looked for but found no such rationale. In\nthe context of UK company law, the non-frustration rule is unnecessary and\nwithout justification.\nThe UK\u0092s Takeover Defence Prohibition 307\n"}
