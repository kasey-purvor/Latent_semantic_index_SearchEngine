INTRODUCTION\nThe microfabrication of glass structures using plasma\netching is a promising emerging technology which can be\nused in a variety of areas, such as optoelectronics,\nmillimeter-wave technology, microelectromechanical sys-\ntems ~MEMS!, capillary chips and diffraction gratings.1 Be-\ncause glass is a relatively cheap suitable substrate for good\nion-exchange waveguides, it is often used in integrated op-\ntics devices. For integrated sensors,2 the ability to fabricate\nstructures with near vertical sidewalls and reduced surface\nroughness is a key factor. In this regard, the control of sur-\nface roughness is especially important for optical and micro-\nwave devices since surface roughness can induce light scat-\ntering and signal loss which ultimately degrades device\nperformance.3 The fabrication of suitable structures can be\nachieved by optimizing the etching process parameters. In\naddition, the range and degree of control of the process pa-\nrameters offered by a particular etching system determine its\nsuitability for a given application. For the fabrication of such\nhigh precision devices, dry etching, because of its aniso-\ntropic properties, is commonly preferred to wet etching\nwhich is generally isotropic and can induce undesirable un-\ndercutting.\nDry etching occurs when the ion and neutral species pro-\nduced in a plasma discharge interact with the substrate and it\ncan be characterized by two different processes. These are\nsputter etching, where the etching is due to the kinetics of the\nion and neutral species produced in the plasma, and reactive\nion etching ~RIE!, where it is the chemical reaction between\nthe ions and the substrate that results in the etching. The etch\nrate, shape and morphology of the etched features are depen-\ndent on the extent to which one of these dry etch mecha-\na!Corresponding author; electronic mail: d.zeze@surrey.ac.uk3620021-8979\/2002\/92(7)\/3624\/6\/$19.00\nDownloaded 06 Dec 2007 to 131.227.178.92. Redistribution subject tnisms is dominant which in turn depends on the etching sys-\ntem and process parameters. There are a number of different\ntypes of plasma sources, such as those based on direct cur-\nrent discharge, radio frequency ~rf! sources ~capacitively\ncoupled or inductively coupled! and microwave ~mw!\nsources ~electron cyclotron resonance, surfatron, etc.!.4 In\naddition, in the RIE process different types of reactive gases\nsuch as CF4 , SF6 , CHF3 and chlorine-based gases can be\nused. These reactive gases are often mixed to user-defined\nconcentrations with argon, oxygen or hydrogen to enhance\nthe etching properties of the plasma.\nIn this article we report on the etching of features in\nquartz and Corning 7740 ~Pyrex! using a combined rf micro-\nwave etching system ~rf\/mw RIE! analyzed with surface pro-\nfilometry, scanning electron microscopy ~SEM! and atomic\nforce microscopy ~AFM! techniques. The etch rate, surface\ntopography, taper angle and surface roughness of the etched\nstructures are investigated as a function of the etching pa-\nrameters. We also investigate the effects of different masking\ntechniques on the etched features. The simulation of the edge\nprofile indicates how masking can be modified to achieve the\nrequired well-defined device structures.\nII. EXPERIMENT\nThe rf\/mw RIE system was designed to be able to both\ndeposit thin films by plasma enhanced chemical vapor depo-\nsition ~PECVD! and to reactively ion etch features in\nsamples. A schematic of the system is shown in Fig. 1. The\nsample is placed on a 11.5 cm diameter driven electrode\n~sample holder!. After suitable vacuum is achieved\n(;1027 Torr), process gases are introduced into the cham-\nber using mass flow controllers. The plasma is then ignited\nusing a tunable capacitively coupled rf source powered by a\nENI HF-300 supply before the mw radiation is coupled into\nthe chamber ~supplied by a magnetron powered by a Muegge4 \u00a9 2002 American Institute of Physics\no AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/jap\/copyright.jsp\n3625J.

The plasma is pulled through the microwave cavity\ntowards the sample under the influence of the negative self-\nbias produced on the substrate table by the rf signal. To mini-\nmize the rf and microwave reflected power during the depo-\nsition or etching process, the system is tuned using an\ninductive matching unit for the rf source and a longitudinal\ncoarse and three-stud fine tuner for the microwave source.\nThe RIE of quartz and Pyrex samples was carried out\nusing high purity CF4 \/Ar and CF4 \/O2 gas mixtures in the\nrf\/mw-RIE system. The substrates ~approximately 1 cm2)\nused are commercially available Pyrex ~borosilicate glass,\nCorning 7740 standard, provided by Corning International,\nWiesbaden, Germany! and fused quartz @very fine ~VF!\ngrade, provided by Heraeus, Byfleet, England# which were\ncleaned using acetone, methanol, isopropanol and de-ionized\nwater prior to etching. Subsequently, the mask layers were\nprepared by either evaporating a thin Ni metal film, patterned\nusing standard photolithographic techniques, or by attaching\na silicon wafer to the sample using vacuum adhesive pads.\nPrior to etching, the chamber was evacuated to a base pres-\nsure of ;1027 Torr. The microwave power levels were var-\nied between 0 and 1200 W for the 2.45 GHz source. The rf\npower level was also varied between 0 and 300 W for the\n13.56 MHz rf generator, corresponding to a negative self-\nbias of 0\u2013500 V. In order to more efficiently control device\nfabrication, the system was calibrated by systematically\nvarying the process gas flow rates, process pressure ~5\u201360\nmTorr!, gas mixture and the rf and mw power levels. During\nthe etching process, the sample holder was water cooled to\nkeep the sample near room temperature to prevent any ther-\nmally induced effects on the sample. A K-type thermocouple\nwas incorporated into the process chamber to monitor the\nsample holder temperature before and after processing.\nAfter etching any remaining mask material was removed\nby wet chemical etching. The processed samples were ana-\nlyzed using a surface profilometer ~Sloan Technology Dektak\nIIA! with resolution better than 1 nm to measure the etch\ndepth. A Hitachi S4000 cold field emission gun SEM oper-\nating at 5 kV was used to study the surface morphology of\nthe specimens and secondary electron signals were used to\nevaluate the etch profiles. Ambient AFM measurements were\nperformed using a Digital Instruments Nanoscope IIIA oper-\nating in tapping mode to quantitatively evaluate the etch pro-\nfile and surface roughness.\nFIG. 1.

Etch rate and system calibration\nAn initial calibration of the rf\/mw-RIE system for a fixed\nmicrowave power of 300 W showed that 30\u201335 mTorr, 20%\nCF4 ~in Ar! and 320\u2013400 V were the optimum values of\nprocess pressure, gas mixture and negative self-bias, respec-\ntively. These operating conditions resulted in etch rates of\nabout 45 nm\/min for a silicon wafer ~^100&, p type! and 30\nnm\/min for quartz. This latter value is similar to that reported\nby Leech5 for etching quartz in a rf CF4 plasma with a nega-\ntive self-bias voltage in the range of 320\u2013360 V. Note that,\nunder given processing conditions, the etch rate of Pyrex\nspecimens was similar to that of quartz. The effects of in-\ncreasing the microwave power level and the percentage of\nCF4 in the gas mixture are shown in Fig. 2 for both silicon\nand quartz. In Fig. 2~a!, the etch rates of Si and quartz are\nseen to increase up to 130 and 100 nm\/min, respectively, as\nthe power level is increased to 850 W. The effects of the\nvarying the CF4 content in the gas mixture were also inves-\ntigated for a fixed microwave power of 600 W and are shown\nin Fig. 2~b!. The etch rate of Si increases to 172 nm\/min as\nthe concentration of CF4 in the mixture is raised to 84% and\nsaturates thereafter, whereas the maximum etch rate of\nquartz, 95 nm\/min, does not vary significantly as the CF4\ncontent in the gas mixture is varied from 0% to 100% for a\nconstant microwave power of 600 W. For the RIE system\ndescribed above, the etch rate of quartz using 2340 V self-\nbias is 95 nm\/min is more than twice that reported by Leech5\nfor similar self-bias voltages in a CF4 rf plasma source.\nHowever, higher etch rates up to ;1 mm\/min, have been\nFIG. 2.

Appl. Phys., Vol. 92, No. 7, 1 October 2002 Zeze et al.achieved elsewhere6 using an inductively coupled plasma\n~ICP!. The high etch rate produced by an ICP system is at-\ntributed to the greater plasma density and other parameters,\nsuch as plasma potential and ion energy spread. In an ICP\nsystem, the ion density is .1011 ions\/cm3 and can reach\n1013 ions\/cm3.7,8 In turn, although rf coupled systems can\ntheoretically reach 1012 ions\/cm3, only about\n1010\u2013 1011 ions\/cm3 are measured. In the system in this\nstudy, the etching chamber used is designed to incorporate a\nload lock with in situ scanning tunneling microscopy facili-\nties and the volume of the entire system vessel and the mi-\ncrowave cavity are ;1 and ;0.01 m3, respectively. This\nmay affect the confinement and reduce the density of the\nplasma. Under the same processing conditions, the etch rate\nfor a quartz sample increased from 30 to 40 nm\/min when an\ninternal side shielding wall was inserted into the microwave\ncavity, thereby reducing the diameter of the cylindrical cav-\nity from 15 to 11.5 cm.\nIn order to further investigate the etch rate of the rf\/mw-\nRIE system, the etching characteristics of CF4 \/Ar were com-\npared with those of CF4 \/O2 gas mixtures. The results indi-\ncate that, under the same experimental conditions ~power\nlevels, gas flows, process pressure! which were optimized for\nCF4 \/Ar, the etch rate using a CF4 \/O2 plasma is at least 1.5\ntimes higher than that for CF4 \/Ar for all the materials stud-\nied here. This is comparable to results reported elsewhere.9\nB. Surface roughness\nThe Pyrex samples were masked by evaporating a thin\n(;150 nm) Ni layer and patterned using conventional pho-\ntolithography. The RIE process was set up to etch 1\u20133 mm,\nusing either CF4 \/O2 or CF4 \/Ar plasma to study the resultant\nsurface roughness of the etched surfaces while all other ex-\nperimental conditions were kept constant. A detailed SEM\nand AFM study of the etched profiles combined with the\nsurface profilometry data was used to evaluate qualitatively\nand quantitatively the surface roughness and the quality of\nthe sidewalls. SEM images of Pyrex samples etched in\nCF4 \/O2 and in CF4 \/Ar plasma are shown in Fig. 3. On a 30\nmm scale, a comparison of Fig. 3~a! with Fig. 3~b! indicates\nthat the masked region of the specimen etched using the\nCF4 \/Ar @Fig. 3~b!# exhibits a higher surface roughness than\nthe masked region subject to a CF4 \/O2 etch. The rough-\nnesses of the etched and masked areas are very similar to\nthose for the sample etched with the CF4 \/O2 @Fig. 3~a!#\nwhereas the masked area of the CF4 \/Ar etched sample is\nconsiderably rougher than the etched area @Fig. 3~b!#. One\ncan also observe that the neighboring region between the\netched and masked areas ~interface! shows a degree of\nroughness that is higher than that of the etched areas. This is\nindicative of the difficulty of fully controlling the etching\nprocess and is believed to result from the reflections and\nmultiple scattering of species onto the sidewall. The differ-\nence in the electrical field distribution in the regions neigh-\nboring the edges cannot be discounted either in this particu-\nlar case ~as discussed later!. Higher magnification images ~1\nmm scale! of the specimens shown in Figs. 3~c! and 3~d!\nunderscore the difference in surface roughness for the differ-Downloaded 06 Dec 2007 to 131.227.178.92. Redistribution subject tent gas mixtures used. The masked ~unetched! region in Fig.\n3~d! exhibits an estimated surface roughness of 200 nm\nwhereas the sample in Fig. 3~c! exhibits a smooth unetched\narea. The etched area in Fig. 3~c! gives a root mean square\n~rms! roughness ;50 nm from the AFM measurements\nshown in Table I.\nThe surface topography of the etched samples was stud-\nied in detail using AFM. Typical surface maps of the etched\nand masked areas for the sample processed with the CF4 \/O2\nplasma are shown in Figs. 4~a! and 4~b!, respectively. The\nanalysis of the sample etched using CF4 \/O2 gives rms sur-\nface roughness values of 34 and 49 nm for the masked and\netched surfaces of the Pyrex samples, respectively. The rms\nsurface roughnesses of the Pyrex samples after RIE with dif-\nferent gas mixtures and masks are given in Table I. The\nresults indicate that the low rms roughness of the Pyrex\nsample before etching ~rms roughness of ;9 nm) is in-\ncreased after etching through a thin (;150 nm) conventional\nNi mask. It is reasonable to believe that the wet etch which\nremoves the remaining mask material plays a role in increas-\ning the roughness of the masked regions. However, since all\nthe samples were processed under the same wet etching con-\nditions, it is unlikely that the wet etch ~removal! of the mask\nmaterial is responsible for roughening of the surface below\nthe mask. If it contributes to the roughening, then the contri-\nbution is expected to be similar for all the specimens regard-\nless of the dry etching process under which they have been\nprocessed prior to wet removal of the mask material. This\nroughness induced below the mask that occurs in parallel\nFIG. 3. SEM characteristics of Pyrex etched using a CF4 \/O2 plasma ~a!, ~c!\nand a CF4 \/Ar plasma ~b!, ~d!.

Appl. Phys., Vol. 92, No. 7, 1 October 2002 Zeze et al.with the etching of the exposed areas is more pronounced\nusing the CF4 \/Ar plasma than the CF4 \/O2 plasma. There-\nfore, these results are thought to originate from the kinetic\nproperties of the ion and neutral species impacting the rela-\ntively thin mask thereby producing craters in the sample be-\nlow the metal mask, a purely \u2018\u2018ballistic\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018physical sput-\ntering effect.\u2019\u2019 Since the argon ions are much heavier than the\noxygen ions, this effect is expected to be more marked in a\nCF4 \/Ar plasma than in a CF4 \/O2 plasma, as observed.\nThe data in Table I also show that surface roughness\nvalues as low as 49 nm can be achieved on the etched sur-\nfaces. For 3\u20135 mm deep structures devices processed in the\nrf\/mw-RIE system, the surface rms roughness was below 150\nnm. This is significantly less than the rms roughness value of\n1 mm for similar features etched in Pyrex that have been\nreported in the literature.6 The rms roughness was also mea-\nsured ~surface profilometry and SEM! to be ;200 nm for 15\nand 21 mm deep structures, indicating that the roughness\ninduced using the RIE process does not scale linearly with\nthe etch depth. This is particularly important for deep etch-\ning, such as that used for MEMS devices. For example, in\nFIG. 4. AFM images of a Pyrex sample showing the rms surface roughness\ninduced by the reactive ion etching process on the etched area ~a! and\nbeneath the masked region ~b!.Downloaded 06 Dec 2007 to 131.227.178.92. Redistribution subject tthe fabrication of multichip optoelectronic module ~MOM!\nstructures, the surface roughness plays a significant role\nsince the level of scattering and microwave losses, which are\nrelated to the surface roughness, modify the optical and mi-\ncrowave properties of the structure. As reported by Berg and\nPang,10 the surface damage, reflectivity, sidewall damage,\ndefect density, thermal load etc. that occur during the etching\nprocess can degrade device characteristics. The selectivity\nfactor of the masking materials can affect the surface rough-\nness of the etched areas, since materials with a relatively\nhigher etch rate will tend to result in the redeposition11 of\nmore nonvolatile materials than masks with a relatively low\netch rate. For example, the etch rate of a silicon wafer is\nmuch higher than that of Ni. In our case, for the sample\nmasked by Si, more nonvolatile materials may be redepos-\nited onto the etched area, thereby inducing a higher degree of\nroughness as indicated in Table I ~136 compared to ;50 nm\nfor the sample coated with a nickel layer!.\nC. Taper angle and edge profile\nTwo sets of Pyrex samples ~labeled S1 and S2! coated\nwith approximately 150 nm of Ni were patterned using pho-\ntolithographic techniques and AZ4330a photoresist which\nproduces a ;3 mm thick film. After patterning the nickel, the\nresist layer was removed from sample S1 using acetone\nwhereas for sample S2 the photoresist covering the nickel\nwas not removed. Both samples were processed simulta-\nneously in the RIE system using the same plasma conditions.\nThe AFM edge profiles of these samples are shown in Fig. 5.\nFrom these profiles and the data collected from the deep\netched structures ~5\u201315 mm!, the taper angle was measured\nto be between 80\u00b0 and 86\u00b0 for both samples, which is desir-\nable for device manufacture. The taper angles obtained here\nare comparable to those of 79\u00b0 \u2013 88\u00b0 reported in the\nliterature.6 Also, for sample S2, with the photoresist coating\n@Fig. 5~c!#, the etched area is relatively rough, with a rms\nvalue of 82 nm, compared to 49 nm for the sample without\nthe photoresist covering the metal mask. Before removing\nthe excess photoresist and the Ni mask, solid residues were\nobserved on the etched areas using an optical microscope.\nThis is probably due to nonvolatile materials being released\nfrom the photoresist and redepositing onto the surface being\netched during the process as already demonstrated\nFIG. 5. Etch profiles of Pyrex for a specimen covered with a thin metal\nlayer ~a!, ~b! and for a specimen with a dielectric layer coating on the metal\nmask ~c!, ~d!.o AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/jap\/copyright.jsp\n3628 J. Appl. Phys., Vol. 92, No. 7, 1 October 2002 Zeze et al.elsewhere.12 This effect of materials redepositing randomly\nonto the surface being etched could reduce the etch rate and\ninduce a higher degree of roughness that compromises the\nuniformity of the etched surfaces.\nA comparison of the pictures and scan profiles shown in\nFig. 5 shows interesting differences between the profiles at\nthe boundary between the etched and unetched regions. In\nFigs. 5~c! and 5~d!, sample S2 ~with the photoresist coating\ncovering the Ni mask! exhibits a sharp change between the\nunetched surface and the etch wall, resulting in near vertical\nsidewalls. In contrast, in Figs. 5~a! and 5~b!, sample S1,\nwithout the photoresist coating on the mask, has a graded\nboundary between the sidewall and masked area. This ero-\nsion of the corner, with an angle of approximately 45\u00b0 in the\nplot, can be seen clearly in both the surface maps and the\nsection profiles. Note that similar features with rounded cor-\nners were observed on silica structures by Bazylenko and\nGross13 although the process conditions ~hollow cathode dis-\ncharge plasma source using a mixture of CF4 \/CHF3 , Ar or\nO2) used were different from those in the current study. It\nappears that the presence of the layer of photoresist on the\nmetal mask is responsible for a better edge profile under the\nconditions described in this article. This is particularly im-\nportant because it could be the basis of a cost-effective\nmethod of fabricating 0\u20135 mm deep devices with sharp edges\nand near vertical walls using RIE.\nThe question of how or if the thickness of the photoresist\ninfluences the shape of the edge profile, now under investi-\ngation, is not yet fully understood. However, in the present\nwork, we have anticipated that photoresist as a dielectric\nmaterial would allow a more uniform distribution of the elec-\ntrical field on the surface of the sample during the etching\nprocess and prevent erosion of the edges. The possible pres-\nence of thin native oxide or of that produced at the surface of\nthe nickel layer by interaction with oxygen plasma (CF4 \/O2)\ncan affect the conductivity of the mask material during the\netching process. This oxide, to some degree, may affect the\nroughness induced beneath the mask by virtue of creating an\nartificial dielectric layer on the top of the nickel, but further\nstudy is required before a conclusion can be drawn. How-\never, the conductivity should remain significantly high com-\npared to that of photoresist since clear differences are ob-\nserved between the features of specimens etched with and\nwithout photoresist covering the nickel mask ~Fig. 5!. There-\nfore, in the simulation below, we have discounted the reduc-\ntion of the conductivity of nickel induced by the plasma\ntreatment so as to model an ideal case that explains the\npresent experimental results.\nD. Simulation and masking model\nThe above results and discussion show that the masking\ntechniques employed here during RIE are important factors\nthat significantly influence the profile of the etched features.\nIn order to quantitatively understand this effect in greater\ndetail we have simulated the electric field distribution around\nthe edges of the mask material by solving either the Laplace\nequation ~for metallic substrates! or the Poisson equation for\ndielectric substrates. The model consists of estimating theDownloaded 06 Dec 2007 to 131.227.178.92. Redistribution subject tlocal electric field and comparing it to the macroscopically\napplied electric field. The ratio between these two quantities\nis the field enhancement factor, b, for the two identically\ngeometric square substrates of metal and a dielectric with\n\u00abr55. It was found that at the corner of the dielectric sub-\nstrate the maximum value of b obtained was 1.25, whereas\nthe field enhancement at the corner of the metallic substrate\nis 1.75. Enhancements above 1 at the corner can be attributed\nto the apex of the corners and the higher value in the metallic\ncase can be attributed to the higher conductivity of the ma-\nterial and lower field penetration into the metal. Conse-\nquently the ion yield will be larger at the edges of the me-\ntallic mask than at the dielectric mask. This causes the edges\nof the masks to be etched away, with this effect being more\npronounced in the case of the metallic masks.\nThe agreement between the experimental observation\nand the simulation, with regard to erosion of the edge of the\netched walls where only a simple thin metal mask is used,\nallows us to propose the following phenomenological model\nof metal mask erosion during a RIE process. For a thin,\nuncoated metal mask there is higher field enhancement dur-\ning the RIE process at the exposed edges of the mask that\ninduces erosion of the metal mask at these points @Fig. 6~a!#.\nThe mask will slowly be etched back, progressively exposing\nmore of the substrate to the ion flux. The result of this pro-\ncess is that the edge of the etched wall will have an eroded\nappearance, as shown in Figs. 6~b! and 6~c! and not an ideal\nperpendicular profile. One way of addressing this effect is to\nspin coat an additional layer of dielectric onto the metallic\nmask which would lead to a more uniform distribution of the\nelectrical field at the surface of the specimen @Fig. 6~d!#. This\nwould prevent the mask from being etched back while the\nphotoresist coating is still present, resulting in a better edge\nprofile @Figs. 6~e! and 6~f!#. The redeposition of nonvolatile\nmaterial that occurs during the etching process could com-\npromise the etch rate, sharpness and roughness of the final\netched surface and is the subject of further study.\nFIG. 6.

CONCLUSION\nThe etch rate of Pyrex ~95 nm\/min! in the rf\/mw-RIE\nsystem studied here is high compared to that published using\nconventional RIE systems and is sufficient for the fabrication\nof features with depths up to 15 mm. The etching is depen-\ndent on many process parameters, such as the rf induced\nself-bias, microwave power, process pressure, gas composi-\ntion, etc. The most dramatic effect was found by substituting\nCF4 \/O2 for CF4 \/Ar as the feed gas. In almost identical ex-\nperimental conditions, the etch rate of a CF4 \/O2 plasma is\n1.5 times higher than that of a CF4 \/Ar plasma. Also, CF4 \/O2\nplasma produces a smoother etched surface, has a higher etch\nrate and avoids roughening of the masked areas, which is\nobserved when using CF4 \/Ar for the material used here.\nThe observed roughening of the sample through a thin\nmetal mask for the CF4 \/Ar gas mixture is believed to be due\nto the Ar ions having sufficient kinetic energy to cause cra-\ntering or etching of the substrate below the mask. AFM\nanalysis of the reactive ion etched metal masked Pyrex\nsamples showed that there was erosion of the edge profile\nbetween the unetched surface and the etched wall. A simula-\ntion was used to show an enhancement of the electrostatic\nfield at the edges of the thin metallic mask which was less\nsignificant for the dielectric coated mask. Therefore, it was\nsuggested that this enhanced field would cause the edge of\nthe mask to be preferentially etched. A phenomenological\nmodel was proposed to explain this and a simple techniqueDownloaded 06 Dec 2007 to 131.227.178.92. Redistribution subject tinvolving use of a dielectric coated metal mask was proposed\nand shown to overcome this problem for deep etching up to\n15 mm. This technique resulted in the fabrication of struc-\ntures with improved sidewalls and highly defined edges.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors wish to acknowledge the financial support\nof the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research\nCouncil ~EPSRC!.
