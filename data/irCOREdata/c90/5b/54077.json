M. Lark\n(murray.lark@bbsrc.ac.uk)\n1 Introduction\nSoil information is costly and relatively sparse, so there is\ninterest in methods to predict soil properties at unsampled\nsites from a set of sampled data. Generally the precision of\nsuch predictions can be improved if covariates, which reflect\nfactors of soil formation, are incorporated into the predictor.\nThere are various ways to do this. One of the most efficient,\nwhen direct observations of the target variable are distributed\nwith reasonable coverage over the area of interest, is the em-\npirical best linear unbiased predictor (E-BLUP) based on a\nlinear mixed model (see below) in which the relationship be-\ntween the target variable and the covariate is expressed as a\nlinear function of the covariate, and the residual variation is\nexpressed as a combination of a spatially correlated random\neffect (a random variable), and identically and independently\ndistributed random error. The E-BLUP is, in effect, a com-\nbination of a regression-type prediction from the covariation\nand a kriging-type prediction from the random effect. This\nwas discussed in the context of soil information by Lark et al.\n(2006), and the approach has been applied in various stud-\nies (e.g., Chai et al., 2008). In addition to the predictor, a\nprediction error variance is also computed which provides a\nmeasure of the uncertainty of the prediction.\nIn the standard LMM-E-BLUP approach to spatial pre-\ndiction, as in all geostatistical methods, there is a necessary\nassumption of stationarity in the covariance of the random\nvariation. For geostatistical prediction we require the covari-\nance between the random effect at pairs of sites (including\nsites where we have data and sites where we require predic-\ntions). Since our data provide us, in effect, with a single\nrealization of this random variable, the covariances cannot\nbe obtained directly. Some generalization about the random\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n2082 K. A. Haskard et al.: Predicting soil potassium content\nvariation is therefore necessary, so as to allow the parameters\nof the LMM to be estimated. Commonly we assume station-\narity in the covariance (second-order stationarity). Under this\nassumption the variance of the random variable is the same\nat any two locations, si and sj , and the correlation between\nthe variable at the locations is a function of the lag vector\nbetween them,\n\u03c1\n(\nsi \u2212 sj\n)\n. (1)\nThis assumption makes it possible to model the covariance of\nthe random effect with some appropriate parametric function.\nThe parameters of this function are best estimated by residual\nmaximum likelihood (REML).\nHowever, the assumption of stationarity in the covariance\nis not usually plausible when applied to properties of the soil,\nparticularly across complex landscapes. It must first be noted\nthat the assumption does not apply to data, but rather to a\nrandom function of which it is assumed that the data are a\nrealization. However, behaviour of the data may indicate\nwhether or not the assumption is plausible. When a vari-\nable appears substantially more heterogeneous in one part of\nthe landscape than in another, or when the dominant spatial\nscale of variation in one part of the landscape differs from\nanother, then this casts doubt on the plausibility of station-\narity assumptions. This has been discussed by, for example,\nVoltz and Webster (1990) who examined variograms for soil\nproperties over contrasting Jurassic strata in central England,\nincluded in a single data set, and found pronounced differ-\nences. Analysis of soil data sets using wavelet transforms\n(e.g., Lark and Webster, 2001) similarly cast doubt on the\nplausibility of stationarity assumptions.\nDoes the failure of this assumption matter? Lark (2009)\ncompared two LMM for a soil data set. In one of these a\nconventional assumption of stationarity in the variance was\nmade. In the second a non-stationary variance model was fit-\nted (although the underlying autocorrelation was stationary).\nLark (2009) showed that predictions made under these two\nmodels were very similar, but that the prediction error vari-\nances derived from the non-stationary model gave a much\nbetter description of the errors in predictions at validation\nsites. (If the autocorrelation appeared to be non-stationary,\nthen this might affect the predictions themselves).\nIt would therefore seem worthwhile to attempt to model\nnon-stationary covariation of soil properties as a basis for\nspatial prediction. For this reason Haskard and Lark (2009)\npresented a development and case study of the method of\nspectral tempering proposed by Pintore and Holmes (2004,\n2005). This method is described in more detail below. Es-\nsentially it allows both the variance and autocorrelation of\nthe property of interest to adapt locally in response to a set\nof covariates. Thus the variable might appear \u201csmoother\u201d in\nsome regions than another. Haskard and Lark (2009) also\nfound that the prediction error variances based on this non-\nstationary model gave a better account of the uncertainty of\npredictions at validation sites than did a simpler stationary\nlinear mixed model.\nA covariate which has been widely used for the prediction\nof soil properties is passive gamma ray emissions from the\nearth\u2019s surface (McKenzie and Ryan, 1999; Wilford, 2008).\nThese emissions arise from the decay of particular elements\nin the upper 35 cm or so of the soil. Gamma rays are emit-\nted over an energy spectrum, which can be partitioned into\nbands dominated by particular decays. Three bands which\nare widely used in soil studies are those associated with\npotassium, uranium and thorium. Much of the application\nof gamma radiometry for prediction of soil properties has\ntaken place in Australia. Here the total airborne radiometric\nsignal \u2013 or the ratios between potassium and thorium concen-\ntrations \u2013 relates to the age of the weathered material at the\nland surface and provides information on soil texture prop-\nerties (Taylor et al., 2002). Radiometry has therefore proved\na useful tool to map complex patterns of soil variation that\narise from erosion and deposition of material over long peri-\nods of time.\nRawlins et al. (2007) undertook a statistical analysis of the\nradiometric potassium signal from the soil surface in a part\nof eastern England, and showed that its variation could be\nattributed to a range of sources including the total potassium\ncontent of the soil determined from samples collected in the\nfield. This suggested that gamma radiometry is a potentially\nuseful source of soil information in the relatively young soils\nof the United Kingdom. This paper addresses the following\nquestion. If we have a data set on soil potassium as a ba-\nsis for geostatistical prediction at unsampled sites, can we\nbeneficially use airborne radiometric data to model both the\nmean and covariance of the target property in an appropri-\nate LMM? By doing so, we may be able to improve both the\nprecision of the predictions of soil potassium content and the\nvalidity of the prediction error variances.\n2 The statistical model\n2.1 The stationary model, estimation and prediction\nThe analyses in this paper are based on the linear mixed\nmodel (LMM) in which our data are assumed to be a realiza-\ntion of a random variate, with a single value at any location,\nz = X\u03c4 + u + e, (2)\nwhere z is the n\u00d71 vector of observed values at locations\ns1,s2,...sn respectively, \u03c4 is a t\u00d71 vector of fixed effects,\nsuch as to allow for a smooth spatial trend or other external\neffects, with corresponding n\u00d7t design matrix X, u is a n\u00d71\nvector of zero-mean random effects and e is an n\u00d71 vector\nof independent random errors, one element for each obser-\nvation. In the application of the LMM to spatial data the\nrandom component u models the spatially-correlated compo-\nnent of variation and e is the so-called \u201cnugget effect\u201d which\nBiogeosciences, 7, 2081\u20132089, 2010 www.biogeosciences.net\/7\/2081\/2010\/\nK. A. Haskard et al.: Predicting soil potassium content 2083\nincorporates uncorrelated measurement error and sources of\nvariation in the target property that are uncorrelated over the\nshortest interval between observations. We assume that the\nrandom components u and e are mutually independent. The\nvariance matrix of u is G (n\u00d7n) whose elements depend only\non the sample locations under the assumption of a stationary\ncovariance function, with a few parameters. These param-\neters are variances, and spatial parameters that characterize\nthe spatial correlation function introduced in Eq. (1) above.\nThe random vector e has zero mean and covariance matrix R\n(n\u00d7n). The matrix R is diagonal when e denotes a nugget\neffect and R=\u03c3 2nuggetI when it is assumed that the nugget ef-\nfect has stationary variance \u03c3 2nugget. The variance matrix of\nthe random vector z is denoted H=G+R.\nBecause the mean of z in Eq. (2) is given by X\u03c4 it is not\nnecessarily assumed to be stationary, and the fixed effects\ncould describe pronounced spatial trends. However, in stan-\ndard applications of LMM to spatial data it is assumed that\nthe covariance of z is stationary, as described above. In this\nstudy we used an isotropic exponential correlation function\nfor the variable u. If the variance of u is \u03c3 2, then, with a sta-\ntionary exponential model, element {i,j} of the covariance\nmatrix G, which is the covariance between the values of z at\nthe two locations si and sj , is given by\n\u03c3 2\u03c1\n(\u2016 si \u2212 sj \u2016;\u03c6) = \u03c3 2 exp {(\u2212 \u2016 si \u2212 sj \u2016)\/\u03c6}, (3)\nwhere \u03c6 is a distance parameter. Note that in this isotropic\nmodel the separation between the two locations is expressed\nas a (scalar) distance, but the model can be extended to an\nanisotropic case in two or more dimensions (Haskard et al.,\n2007). When such a stationary model has been specified then\nthe variance parameters (\u03c3 2nugget, \u03c3 2 and \u03c6 in this case) can\nbe estimated by residual maximum likelihood (REML), and\nthese estimates can then be used to obtain the best linear un-\nbiased estimator (BLUE) of the fixed effect coefficients \u2014 \u03c4\nin Eq. (2) \u2013 by generalized least squares (details are given by\nLark et al., 2006).\nOnce the parameters of the LMM are estimated then the\nempirical best linear unbiased predictor (E-BLUP) can be\ncomputed at unsampled sites where the fixed effects are\nknown. Let there be p such sites, for which the fixed ef-\nfects are contained in the p\u00d7t design matrix Xp. We require\nthe p\u00d71 vector of E-BLUPs which is\nz\u02dcp = Xp\u03c4\u02c6 + u\u02dcp + e\u02dcp (4)\nwhere \u03c4\u02c6 is the BLUE of the fixed effects vector \u03c4 , u\u02dcp is the E-\nBLUP of the spatially-correlated random effects vector up at\nthe prediction locations, and e\u02dcp is the E-BLUP of the nugget\neffect, which is zero at unsampled locations. The E-BLUP\nu\u02dcp is given by\nu\u02dcp = GpoG\u22121u\u02dc\n= GpozTPz,\nwhere Gpo=Cov\n{\nup, u\n}\n, the elements of which can be com-\nputed given the REML estimates of the variance parame-\nters, and P=H\u22121\u2212H\u22121X(XTH\u22121X)\u22121XTH\u22121. This shows\nthat the E-BLUP at an unsampled location consists of a\nregression-type component (Xp\u03c4\u02c6 ) and a kriging-type com-\nponent (u\u02dcp).\nThe PEV is the variance of the prediction error,\nVar\n{\nz\u02dcp\u2212zp\n}\n, which can be obtained from\n[Xp, GpoG\u22121] A\u22121[Xp, GpoG\u22121]T\n+ Gpp \u2212 GpoG\u22121GTpo + Rpp, (5)\nwhere Gpp=Var\n{\nup\n}\n, Rpp=Var\n{\nep\n} (again, obtained from\nthe REML estimates of the variance parameters) and A is the\ncoefficient matrix from the mixed model equations\nA =\n[\nXTR\u22121X XTR\u22121Z\nZTR\u22121X ZTR\u22121Z + G\u22121\n]\n.

(2006), and the\nreader looking for a more extensive treatment is referred to\nStein (1999).\n2.2 The non-stationary model\nIn this paper we use the modified and extended version of\nthe spatially adaptive spectral tempering procedure (Pintore\nand Holmes, 2004, 2005) that we introduced and described\nin full elsewhere (Haskard and Lark, 2009). We outline this\nprocedure below.\nConsider a case where we are interested in a total of\nnt=n+np locations, at n of which we have direct observa-\ntions of our target variable as well as covariates for the fixed\neffects, and at the other np of which we know the values of\nthe covariates for the fixed effects and require predictions of\nthe target variable because it has not been measured there.\nWe may propose an initial stationary variance model for our\nvariable, and from the parameters of this compute a nt\u00d7nt\ncovariance matrix, C. A principal components analysis of\nthis matrix yields what is known as its spectral decomposi-\ntion\nC =\nnt\u2211\nk=1\nvk\u03bbkv\nT\nk , (7)\nwhere v1,v2,...,vnt are the nt eigenvectors, and\n\u03bb1,\u03bb2,...,\u03bbnt are the corresponding eigenvalues. These\nlatter constitute an empirical spectrum of the data. The\neigenvectors can be regarded as a basis for the data, that is to\nsay we can represent the variable as a weighted sum of the\neigenvectors. If we examine the eigenvectors it can be seen\nthat some correspond to high-spatial frequency (short-range)\ncomponents of the variable where as others account for low\nfrequency components, broader trends. The eigenvalues, as\nan empirical spectrum, describe how the overall variance\nof the variable is partitioned between these components.\nwww.biogeosciences.net\/7\/2081\/2010\/ Biogeosciences, 7, 2081\u20132089, 2010\n2084 K. A. Haskard et al.: Predicting soil potassium content\nTempering is a method to modify the form of the spectrum,\nby raising its components to a power \u03b7. Tempering can\ntherefore change both the overall variance of a variable,\nand its distribution between spatial scales. The latter is\nequivalent to a modification of the spatial autocorrelation of\na variable. In spectral tempering the power \u03b7 is modelled\nas a function of location \u03b7(s). This allows the covariance of\nthe variable to change with location, to give a non-stationary\ncovariance matrix\nCNSi,j =\nn\u2211\nk=1\n[vk]i\u03bb\u03b7(si ,sj )k [vk]j , (8)\nwhere\n\u03b7(si, sj ) = 0.5 \u03b7(si) + 0.5 \u03b7(sj ).\nIn our modified spectral tempering procedure the function\n\u03b7(s) is used to adapt the local autocorrelation of the variable\n(we refer to this as the \u201csmoothness\u201d of the variable), and the\nspatially correlated variance (we refer to this as the spatial\nvariance) and the nugget variance are modelled separately,\nalso as functions of spatial coordinates. The variance of the\nrandom effect at location si under this non-stationary model\nis given by \u03c3 2\u03ba (si), where \u03c3 2 is the variance in the initial\nstationary model. Similarly the nugget variance at location\nsi is given by \u03b3 2(si). Clearly these functions must return\npositive values for all nt locations. Once some general para-\nmetric forms for the functions \u03b7(s), \u03ba(s) and \u03b3 2(s) have been\nproposed the parameters are estimated by REML. The resid-\nual log-likelihood can be computed for any proposed set of\nparameters. First we obtain a provisional non-stationary co-\nvariance matrix CNS, by tempering the empirical spectrum\nobtained from initial stationary covariance matrix C. This is\ndone with Eq. (8). This preliminary matrix is then rescaled to\na non-stationary correlation matrix, B, by dividing each ele-\nment by the square-root of the product of the corresponding\nelements on the main diagonal, and then the non-stationary\nmatrix of the random effect GNS is obtained by\nGNS = \u03c3 2diag(\u03ba) 12 B diag(\u03ba) 12 , (9)\nwhere \u03ba=[\u03ba(s1), \u03ba(s2),...]T and \u03c3 2 is the initial stationary\nvariance. The matrix GNS, along with the non-stationary\nnugget variances in \u03b3 2, constitutes the non-stationary vari-\nance component of a linear mixed model.\nThe resulting non-stationary variance parameters can be\nused to compute all the variance matrices required to com-\npute the E-BLUP at the np sites where we require predictions\nof the target variable, and its associated prediction error vari-\nance.\n3 Soil data and their analysis\n3.1 Stationary variance models\nOur data are obtained from 890 locations in a region of ap-\nproximately 2400 km2 in north-east England, collected by\nthe G-BASE project (Johnson et al., 2005) and described\nin detail by Rawlins et al. (2007). At each location we had\ndata on total potassium content of the soil, Ksoil, (depth 35\u2013\n50 cm). We also had a corresponding value of the radiometric\npotassium variable, K0 , extracted from the gamma emission\nspectrum measured by a 256-channel Picodas PGAM 1000\n(Model 6.11) airborne spectroradiometer. The ground foot-\nprint corresponding to each measurement was an ellipse with\na long axis length of approximately 200 m.\nFive cores were taken at the centre and vertices of a square,\nlength 20 m, centred at the nominal location of the data point.\nThe cores were combined and the bulk sample then dried and\ndisaggregated, sieved to pass 150 \u00b5m then coned and quar-\ntered and subsampled to produce a 50-g subsample which\nwas ground in an agate planetary ball mill. A further sub-\nsample was then analysed for total content of a range of el-\nements, including potassium, by wavelength dispersive X-\nray fluorescence spectrometry (XRFS), described in detail by\nJohnson et al. (2005).\nWe subdivided this data set at random into a set of 222 ob-\nservations for modelling and 661 at which predictions would\nbe obtained for validation. We restricted the size of the mod-\nelling data set to about a quarter of the available values since,\nif the data from which the predictions are computed were too\ndense, the prediction error variances would only be sensi-\ntive to the spatial covariance of the random effects over the\nshortest lags. Seven observations were removed because they\ntook extreme values (large and zero). After exploratory anal-\nysis we decided to transform both the total potassium content\nand the gamma potassium values to natural logarithms, since\nunder these transforms an ordinary least squares regression\nof logKsoil on logK0 gave residuals with a histogram (see\nFig. 1) which appears consistent with an assumption of a nor-\nmally distributed random variable.\nThe exploratory statistics of the residuals are also con-\nsistent with an assumption of normality. The coefficient\nof skewness is 0.13 and the excess kurtosis is only 0.18.\nFurthermore the mean and median (0.001 and \u22120.002 re-\nspectively) are very similar, and the first and third quar-\ntiles (\u22120.694 and 0.744 respectively) are symmetrical about\nthe median. Figure 2 shows the scatter plot of the log-\ntransformed variables, and Fig. 3 shows a classified post-plot\nof the residuals, i.e. a plot of the co-ordinates of the sample\npoints with the value of the residuals indicated by the size of\nthe symbols. While an assumption of normality of the resid-\nuals is plausible from the histogram (Fig. 1), it is apparent\nfrom Fig. 2 that the scatter of the residuals appears larger\nwhen the radiometric potassium variable is small. This is not\ncompatible with the assumption of a stationary variance, al-\nthough it must be remembered that stationarity is not a prop-\nerty of data, but of the model that we postulate as underlying\nthe data. Such exploratory analysis can therefore only be in-\ndicative. Figure 3 is suggestive of spatial dependence in the\nresiduals, since those of similar size appear to be clustered.\nBiogeosciences, 7, 2081\u20132089, 2010 www.biogeosciences.net\/7\/2081\/2010\/\nK.

We also found that an exponen-\ntial stationary covariance function gave the best fit in a linear\nmixed model in which the fixed effect structure was a lin-\near function of logK0 . We used this stationary covariance\nfunction to obtain the E-BLUP and corresponding PEVs for\nlogKsoil at all the 661 validation sites. This stationary func-\ntion was also used to provide an initial stationary empirical\nspectrum for spectral tempering to give a non-stationary vari-\nance model.\nIn addition we fitted a linear mixed model in which the\nonly fixed effect was an overall mean, specifying a station-\nary exponential covariance function for the random effect.\nThis was also used to compute the corresponding E-BLUP\nand PEVs of logKsoil at the validation sites. This provides a\nbasis for assessing the utility of K0 as a covariate for spatial\nprediction of Ksoil.\n3.2 Non-stationary variance models\nIn this study we hypothesized that the covariance of trans-\nformed Ksoil, as well as its local mean, could be predicted\nfrom K0 . This hypothesis is compatible with our comments\non Fig. 2 above. We therefore proposed linear functions of\nlogK0 to obtain the expressions required for non-stationary\nvariance models: \u03b7(s), \u03ba(s) and \u03b3 2(s) so that, for example\n\u03b7(si) = a0 + a1 log K0(si).\nThe overall variance models are labeled by a three-\ncharacter code, with the three characters denoting, respec-\ntively, smoothness, spatial variance and nugget variance.

Models of intermediate complexity are also pos-\nsible, so we require a method for model selection. In our\nprevious paper (Haskard and Lark, 2009) we proposed a pro-\ncedure to decide whether or not additional variance parame-\nters are justified by the improved fit that they achieve. It is\nimportant to note that this is a procedure for comparing al-\nternative variance models, it is assumed that the fixed effects\nstructures of all the models are identical, for example a linear\nfunction of logK0 . In this procedure we start with the full\nnon-stationary variance model (six parameters). The station-\nary model can be regarded as a particular case of the full non-\nstationary model, nested within it, in which the parameters\ntake particular values. There are various pathways from the\nfull model to the stationary model through successively sim-\npler models each of which is nested within the (more com-\nplex) models above it on the pathway. This is represented in a\nlattice diagram \u2013 see Fig. 4, Haskard and Lark (2009). Hav-\ning estimated the residual log-likelihood for all the models\non the lattice, we may then consider in turn each alternative\nto the full model that is one step down each of the possible\npathways. Whether the more complex model is justified can\nbe decided by testing twice the log-ratio of the likelihoods of\nthe two models against \u03c72 with N degrees of freedom where\nthe complex model has N more parameters than the simpler.\nIf the null hypothesis is accepted the more complex form of\nthe model is not significantly better than the one a step below\nit, and the step down the path is justified. By repeating this\nprocedure down all the pathways until the null hypothesis for\na particular comparison is rejected (P<0.05), we may obtain\na set of candidate models. These are not necessarily nested,\nif not they can be compared with respect to the Akaike in-\nformation criterion, twice the number of parameters minus\ntwice the log-residual likelihood, which will be smaller for\nthe more parsimonious model (Akaike, 1973).\nAt each validation location we therefore had a prediction\nand PEV from each of: (i) a stationary model in which the\nonly fixed effect is the overall mean, (ii) a stationary model in\nwhich the overall mean and coefficients of K0 are fixed ef-\nfects, and (iii) a set of non-stationary models in which the\noverall mean and coefficients of K0 are fixed effects and\nthe variance model has differing degrees of complexity. We\ncomputed a set of validation statistics from observations and\npredictions at these sites. In general if z(si) is the observed\nvalue of logKsoil at the ith validation location out of np, and\nZ\u02dc(si) is the E-BLUP, given some particular LMM with \u03c3 2p\nthe corresponding PEV, then the prediction error (PE) is\nPE = z(si) \u2212 Z\u02dc(si),\nand the standardized squared prediction error (SSPE) is\nSSPE =\n{\nz(si) \u2212 Z\u02dc(si)\n}2\n\u03c3 2p\n.\nBiogeosciences, 7, 2081\u20132089, 2010 www.biogeosciences.net\/7\/2081\/2010\/\nK.

If the pre-\ndictions accounted for all the variation in the validation data\n(i.e. they are all exact) then R2PA=1. If the predictor is no\nbetter than the sample mean then R2PA=0, and a very poor\npredictor (e.g. a biased one) could have R2PA<0.\nThe SSPE is a measure of the validity of the PEV. The ex-\npected value is 1 when the PEVs are reliable. However, it has\nbeen found (e.g., Lark, 2009) that the median SSPE which is\na more robust statistic may be more useful than the mean for\nassessing PEVs, since it is less affected by a few validation\npoints at which the SSPE is very large or small. Under an\nassumption of normal prediction errors the expected value of\nthe median SSPE is 0.455.\nWe computed an empirical distribution of the mean and\nmedian SSPE under conditions where the same distribution\nof observation and validation sites are used and the data are\na realization of a known spatial model in which the fixed ef-\nfects are a linear function of the overall mean and logK0 and\nthe random effects have a stationary distribution with param-\neters equal to those fitted in our model (0,1,1). We computed\n1001 realizations of this process. The central 95% of the\ndistribution of the mean SSPE was 0.881 to 1.126, with me-\ndian 0.996, while the central 95% of the distribution of the\nmedian SSPE was 0.375 to 0.545, with median 0.454.\n4 Results\nFigure 4 displays a hierarchy of non-stationary variance\nmodels that were fitted, with lines connecting models that are\nnested and therefore for which likelihood-ratio tests can be\ncarried out. P -values are displayed on the connecting lines\nwhen they are less than 0.05. On the basis of residual log-\nlikelihood, two candidate models were identified. The first\nwas 01L with constant variance, with correlation fixed at ex-\nponential (i.e. not spatially adapting) and, with the nugget\nvariance changing spatially, depending linearly on logK0 .\nThe second candidate model was L11, which keeps both\nthe spatial variance and the nugget variance constant but al-\nlows the smoothness to adapt spatially as a linear function\nof logK0 . However this required four parameters to be\nestimated, and while the two models L11 and 01L cannot\nbe compared by a log-likelihood test because they are not\nnested, on the basis of the Akaike Information Criterion the\nlatter was preferred.\nTable 1 shows validation results for the E-BLUPs based\non LMMs with stationary variance models, and a selection of\ncases with non-stationary models. Note first that there was a\nreduction in the mean PE2 on using logK0 as a fixed effect\nfor prediction (R2PA increased from 0.67) but very little differ-\nence among the models with this fixed effect with respect to\nwww.biogeosciences.net\/7\/2081\/2010\/ Biogeosciences, 7, 2081\u20132089, 2010\n2088 K. A. Haskard et al.: Predicting soil potassium content\nPEV and PEV2, for most of the models R2PA=0.74. In short\nthere was little difference, with respect to the precision of the\npredictions, between E-BLUPs with logK0 as a fixed effect\nand stationary and non-stationary variance models, even in\nnon-stationary models where the smoothness (and so the au-\ntocorrelation) was adapted. However, there was an effect on\nthe quality of the computed PEV. Note that the median SSPE\nfor the BLUPs from the stationary model (with logK0 as a\nfixed effect) was smaller than the 2.5 percentile, suggesting\nthat the error variance was overestimated. This is consistent\nwith results of Lark (2009) and Haskard and Lark (2009),\nwho found that the median SSPE of E-BLUPs from sta-\ntionary models indicated that the PEVs were overestimated.\nHowever, some of the non-stationary models for which val-\nidation results of the corresponding E-BLUPs are presented,\nshow mean and median SSPE much closer to the expected\nvalues.\n5 Discussion and conclusions\nThese results show that improvements in the precision of spa-\ntial prediction of soil potassium (log-transformed) of about\n20% (mean square error) were achieved by using the radio-\nmetric potassium signal as a covariate. It is also seen that the\nPEV of E-BLUPs based on a model with a stationary vari-\nance structure, in which this covariate is used, appear to over-\nestimate the uncertainty of the predictions. When E-BLUPs\nwere computed using LMMs based on non-stationary covari-\nance models the PEVs were better as judged by the mean and\nmedian SSPE. However, it must be noted that the LMM se-\nlected on the likelihood criteria and AIC (model 01L), only\nachieved a small improvement over the stationary model,\nas judged by the median SSPE. The best results on SSPE\nwere obtained with model L11, in which the smoothness was\nadapted, but this model would not be selected on the fitting\ncriteria alone, since its advantages over 01L with respect to\nthe likelihood were not large enough to justify the inclusion\nof an additional parameter.\nOur results therefore indicate that across this region some\nmodel for non-stationarity in the variance is appropriate, if\nwe want to put reliance on the PEV of E-BLUPs. They\nalso suggest that spatially adaptive tempering, with K0 as\na predictor for the tempering parameter \u03b7 and local vari-\nances, has potential to improve modelling of the variance of\nsoil potassium. Application of our approach to other land-\nscapes would help to determine whether more complex, non-\nstationary variance models based on suitable covariates can\nimprove prediction of soil properties at unsampled sites.\nThere are clearly questions for further research, prompted\nby the fact that the best non-stationary variance model (se-\nlected on likelihood criteria) did not give the best PEVs when\nthese were validated on independent data. It may be that the\ndependence of the non-stationary parameters on the predictor\ncould be better modelled than by the simple linear functions\nthat we used here. Improving this modelling would require\nthe development of some appropriate method for exploratory\nanalysis of the data. While we might hope that the model se-\nlection on the likelihood criteria for the modelling data subset\nwould identify the model which subsequently proves best on\nthe validation data, it isby no means guaranteed. An alterna-\ntive procedure for model selection might be developed, based\non prediction efficacy with a separate validation data set. Al-\nternatively a cross-validation or generalized cross-validation\nprocedure (Marcotte, 1995) could be used for model selec-\ntion.\nTo conclude, we have shown that the adapted and extended\nspectral tempering method that was presented by Haskard\nand Lark (2009) can be applied to large two-dimensional data\nsets. We have shown that the use of gamma radiometric data\ncan improve spatial prediction of a soil property, and that in\nprinciple using spectral tempering can improve modelling of\nthe spatially-dependent variance of this property, and so the\nPEVs of the predictions. Further work remains to be done on\nthe problem of model selection for non-stationary variance\nstructures.\nAcknowledgements.
