Introduction\n[2] The linear age-progressive characteristics of the\nHawaiian volcanic chain are believed to originate from\ninteraction between an ascending thermal plume and the\noverriding Pacific plate [Morgan, 1971]. Another important\nfeature associated with plume-plate interaction is a sur-\nrounding bathymetric swell with \u00181 km in height and\n\u00181000 km in width (Figures 1a and 1b) [Davies, 1988;\nOlson, 1990]. Such swell topography is of particular interest\nin the studies of mantle dynamics, because it constrains\nplume buoyancy flux that may be related to the cooling rate\nof the core [Davies, 1988; Sleep, 1990].\n[3] Significant progress has been made in understanding\nthe dynamics of plume-plate interaction through analytic\nmodels of lubrication theory and 3-D numerical modeling.\nOlson [1990] proposed that buoyant plume material spread-\ning below a moving lithosphere gives isostatic swell topog-\nraphy that can be predicted from a lubrication theory. Ribe\nand Christensen [1994, 1999] supported Olson\u2019s theory\nwith 3-D numerical models for a range of plume buoyancy\nfluxes and plate velocities. Phipps Morgan et al. [1995]\nemphasized the role of the buoyant depleted mantle associ-\nated with hotspot volcanism in producing the swell. Zhong\nand Watts [2002] found that swell topography from plume-\nplate interaction may explain the uplift history of some\nHawaiian islands.\n[4] However, these studies explored only a limited model\nparameter space for plume-plate interaction, and are difficult\nto be used to understand the time-dependent nature of the\nHawaiian swell topography and plume buoyancy flux as\ndocumented byDavies [1992] andWessel [1993] (Figure 1b).\nHere, we develop scaling laws for plume buoyancy flux,\nswell width and height, using 3-D numerical modeling of\nplume-plate interaction for a wide range of plume and\nmantle viscosity parameters. We apply the scaling laws to\nunderstand the nature of the time dependence of the\nHawaiian swell.\n2. Numerical Model Setup\n[5] We use a parallel Cartesian 3-D version of the\nnumerical finite element model Citcom [Moresi and Gurnis,\n1996; Zhong et al., 2000] to simulate the interaction of the\nHawaiian plume with the overlying Pacific lithosphere\n(Figure 1a). The model is similar to the one used in [Zhong\nand Watts, 2002], which, in turn, is based on the model\npresented by Ribe and Christensen [1994]. The model is\n400 km deep, 3200 km long (i.e. in the plate motion\ndirection) and 1600 km wide. It is symmetric about y = 0,\nand calculations are only done for y > 0 (Figure 1a). An\noceanic plate, being 0\u00b0C at the surface, moves in the\npositive x-direction at vp = 8.6 cm\/yr, which corresponds\nto the absolute Pacific plate motion. A plume is created by\nassigning a hot circular region at the bottom, centered at\n(x,y) = (0,0) with a temperature anomaly \u0001T(r) = \u0001Tp\nexp(\u00ffr2\/Rp\n2) with \u0001Tp and Rp fixed maximum excess\ntemperature and radius of the plume stem, and r the distance\nfrom the plume center. Our model aims to study the local\narea around the plume at high-resolution, and only a larger-\nscale model could be dynamically more self-consistent\nwithout prescribing the parameters \u0001Tp and Rp. We use\nflow-through boundary conditions. The bottom has fixed\nT = 1350\u00b0C + \u0001T, and zero normal stress which permits\nvertical flow. Inflow at x = \u00ff800 km is specified with a\ntemperature that corresponds to a 80-Ma old oceanic mantle\nand horizontal velocity consistent with vp, zero horizontal\nmotion at the bottom, and the viscosity structure [Ribe and\nChristensen, 1994]. A zero normal conductive heat flux\nboundary condition is applied at the outflow boundary, and\nto assure mass conservation, the outflow velocity is equal to\nthe inflow.\n[6] A linear viscous Arrhenius rheology for diffusion\ncreep was assumed, using\nh \u00bc h0 exp\nE\nR\n1\nT\n\u00ff\n1\nTm\n\u0012 \u0013\u0014 \u0015\n; \u00f01\u00de\nGEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 30, NO. 15, 1785, doi:10.1029\/2003GL017646, 2003\nCopyright 2003 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0094-8276\/03\/2003GL017646$05.00\nSDE 3 - 1\nwith h0 the viscosity for T = Tm = 1350\u00b0C, and E the\nactivation energy.

Results\n[7] The numerical model is used to determine the rela-\ntionship between model parameters and model observations,\nincluding plume buoyancy, swell height and swell width. As\npointed out by Olson [1990] and Ribe and Christensen\n[1994], the shape of the plume swell is largely controlled by\nthe plume buoyancy flux, mantle rheology, and velocity of\nthe lithospheric plate. We further elaborate the dependence\nof these model observations on h0, E, \u0001Tp, and Rp with a\nlarge number of calculations, in which we varied each of\nthese model parameters over a plausible range. We vary h0\nfrom 5 \u0002 1019 to 4 \u0002 1020 Pa s, E from 120 to 240 kJ\/mol,\n\u0001Tp from 300 to 400 K, and Rp from 45 to 120 km. In total,\n72 model calculations are used in this study, of which about\nhalf were conducted in [Zhong and Watts, 2002]. These\ncalculations produce a buoyancy flux that varies over more\nthan an order of magnitude, and a swell width and height\nvariation of over half an order of magnitude.\n3.1. Buoyancy Flux\n[8] First we develop a scaling law that relates the plume\nbuoyancy flux F to the model parameters. Before examining\nnumerical results, we consider a simple 1-D analytical pipe\nflow model that provides us guidance to develop the scaling\nlaw. Let Rp be the radius of a hot plume pipe with constant\nexcess temperature\u0001T=\u0001Tp.Thebuoyancyforcepervertical\nsegment dz of a cylinder with radius r\u0014 Rp is pr\n2 drgdz. The\nshear force at the cylinder side is 2prh du\ndr\ndz. Equating\nthose relations gives an expression for du\ndr\n. Ignoring defor-\nmation for r > Rp, where due to lower temperature the\nviscosity is much larger, integration over r gives u(r), and\nF \u00bc\nR Rp\n0\n2pr0u r0\u00f0 \u00dedrdr0 \/\nR4p\u0001T\n2\np\nh\n. A first order Taylor expan-\nsion, h \u0019 h0 exp(\u00ffE\u0001Tp\/(RTm\n2)) leads to\nF \/ h\u00ff10 R\n4\np\u0001T\n2\np exp\nE\nR\n\u0001Tp\nT2m\n\u0012 \u0013\n: \u00f02\u00de\n[9] In the numerical models, F =\nR\n\nb\nvzdrd\nb in which vz\nis the upward vertical velocity. F is monitored through the\nentire bottom boundary \nb. Time-dependent model calcu-\nlations are performed until a steady state buoyancy flux is\nobtained. Results show linear relationships in log-log plots\nof F [kg\/s] against h0 [Pa s], \u0001Tp [\u00b0C], and Rp [km], and\nexponential dependence of F on E [J\/mol], thus consistent\nwith the simple 1-D analytical model of Equation 2. We\ntherefore fit our numerical results of F with a scaling law:\nF0 \u00bc Ah\naF\n0 R\nbF\np \u0001T\ncF\np exp dFF\u0001Tp\n\u00ff \u0001\n: \u00f03\u00de\nBest fitting prefactor and exponents are given in Table 1. The\nexponents correspond reasonably well with the theoretical\nones from Equation 2. Deviations are likely due to 1) the\nproximity of the lithosphere in the 3-D model, whereas the\ntheory uses a simple 1-D approach, and 2) the radially\nvarying plume stem temperature. The fit of numerical results\nto Equation 3 is shown in Figure 2a, for which the standard\ndeviation of the relative misfit is 7.9%. The fit for the\ntheoretical Equation 2 is much worse with a 105% misfit.\nFixing aF, bF, and cF to their theoretical values, and allowing\nonly dF to vary also gives a significant error of 34%, while\nfixing a combination of three other exponents makes the fit\neven worse. Overall, the theory provides a good basis for the\nscaling law, but fine-tuning of aF to dF is necessary to\ndescribe the 3-D character.\n3.2. Width and Height of the Plume Swell\n[10] Next we derive scaling laws for the width W(x)\nand height H(x) of the plume swell. Because the plume\nbuoyancy flux is proportional to the product of plume\nwidth, plume height, and plate velocity [Davies, 1988;\nSleep, 1990; Ribe and Christensen, 1994], we assume that\na similar scaling law basis as in Equation 3 applies. We will\nshow a posteriori that this assumption is correct. A steady\nstate model buoyancy flux is quickly reached, but a steady\nstate plume swell shape takes longer time integration. We\nselected 46 calculations with steady state swell shape.\nWidth and height of each swell are calculated from the\ntopography dh relative to the situation without a plume\n[Ribe and Christensen, 1994].\n[11] Since convective instabilities within the swell\n[Moore et al., 1998] do not occur for the chosen set of\nmodel parameters, we can define the plume W and H from\ndh which makes direct comparison with Hawaiian swell\nobservations straightforward. H(x) [m] is defined as dh at\nthe symmetry axis y = 0, and W(x) [km] as the y-coordinate\nto where dh is reduced to 100 m. W(x) ranges from 250 to\n1500 km (Figure 3a), while the maximum height Hmax\nvaries between 750 and 2500 m (Figure 3b). With the same\nmethod as for the buoyancy flux scaling law in Equation 3,\nwe determine exponents a, b, c, and d to describe the\nFigure 1. (a) Schematic plot of the plume-lithosphere\ninteraction near Hawaii. (b) Data plot for H (thick line) and\nW (thin line) taken from [Wessel, 1993], and the buoyancy\nflux F from [Davies, 1992] (dashed) and [Wessel, 1993]\n(dotted, see text). All curves show a significant increase\ntowards Hawaii around 25 Ma.\nTable 1.

Although these exponents\nfluctuate substantially near the plume center, where the\nplume still feeds the swell, they are nearly constant for x >\n250 km. The exponents a, b, c, and d for both W and H are\naverages for a(x), b(x), c(x), and d(x) from Figure 4 for x >\n250 km. These averages form the basis for scaling laws for\nH andW at maximum height Hmax and corresponding width:\nH0 \u00bc AHh\n\u0016aH\n0 R\n\u0016bH\np \u0001T\n\u0016cH\np exp\n\u0016dHE\u0001Tp\n\u00ff \u0001\n: \u00f04\u00de\nW0 \u00bc AWh\n\u0016aW\n0 R\n\u0016bW\np \u0001T\n\u0016cW\np exp\n\u0016dWE\u0001Tp\n\u00ff \u0001\n: \u00f05\u00de\nValues for these average exponents, AH, and AW are given in\nTable 1. The fit of the scaling laws is illustrated in Figures 2b\nand 2c for Hmax and corresponding width W with a relative\nmisfit standard deviation of 7.4% and 7.2%, respectively.\nThe fit for other x is approximately the same. The relation\nF \u0018 W \u0002 H is confirmed by our scaling laws: multiplication\nof W0 and H0 agrees with F0 within 10% for a, b, c, and d\n(see Table 1).\n[12] We further scaled each of the curves in Figures 3a\nand 3b with their scaling law values from Equations 5 and 4.\nResults for W\/W0 and H\/H0 as a function of x\/W0 are shown\nin Figures 3c and 3d. To first order, the scaled curves cluster\non top of one another, because much of the dependence of\nW and H on h0, Rp, \u0001Tp, and E is removed by the scaling.\nThe remaining spreading indicates what is not included in\nthe scaling law. Obviously, the major portion of this\nremainder is due to the x-dependence of the curves: W\nand H change with the distance from the plume center, and\nthis information is still included after scaling. Interestingly,\nthis x-dependence is not the same for all curves. In the\nscaled W-curves, a pattern can be recognized: smaller h0\ntends to cause continued lateral spreading of the swell\ndownstream (Figure 3c).\n3.3. Hawaiian Buoyancy Flux Variations\n[13] Hawaiian swell observations indicate that both width\nand height have increased substantially at 25 Ma. Height\ndata from Wessel [1993] and width data from Figure 6 in\n[Wessel, 1993] are shown in Figure 1b, together with F-data\nfrom Davies [1992] and from Wessel\u2019s width and height\nvalues, using a formulation by Sleep [1990]. The difference\nbetween these two independent calculations of the plume\nbuoyancy flux can be regarded as the uncertainty in this\nestimate. At around 25 Ma, F-estimates show an increase of\na factor 2.5 to 4. At the same time, H approximately\ndoubles, while W increases much less.\n[14] Our scaling laws for F, W and H may help to\ndistinguish which model parameter may have changed and\ncaused these observed variations. The scaling law expo-\nnents suggest that a growth of Rp would increase H and W\nby the same fraction, and increase F twice as much (see\nTable 1), inconsistent with the observations. Following the\nsame reasoning, a decrease in h0 would affect the width\nFigure 2. Fit of numerical values (vertical axis) to the scaling law prediction (horizontal axis) for (a) the plume buoyancy\nflux F, (b) the maximum swell height Hmax for our scaling (circles) and the Ribe and Christensen [1999]-scaling (crosses),\nand (c) the corresponding width W.\nFigure 3.

Increasing \u0001Tp, on the contrary, would increase the\nswell height much more than the width, which is in\nagreement with the observations. This suggests that at\naround 25 Ma, the plume may have become hotter, rather\nthan just more voluminous, and a 50% \u0001Tp-increase fits the\nobservations best.\n4. Discussion and Conclusions\n[15] We studied the dynamics of the interaction between a\nbuoyant plume and a moving oceanic lithosphere. Based on\n72 calculations with different plume and mantle viscosity\nparameters, we developed scaling laws for the plume buoy-\nancy flux and the swell width and height. We find that\nmultiplication of the scaling laws for the swell width and\nheight corresponds well to the scaling law for the plume\nbuoyancy flux. Those scaling laws suggest that the width\nand the height of the swell are not in the same way sensitive\nto changes in plume temperature, viscosity, or plume radius,\nand that the rapid increase of the Hawaiian plume intensity\nat around 25 Ma was most likely caused by a 50% increase\nin the plume excess temperature.\n[16] Although \u0001Tp and Rp may not be entirely indepen-\ndent, and an increase in the former could result in a change in\nthe latter, we believe that such change in the plume radius is\nsecondary. Furthermore, this application of our scaling laws\nimplicitly assumes that the swell response to changes in the\nplume characteristics is instantaneous. Time-dependent mod-\neling tests show that this response time is at most 5 Ma, and\ntherefore quick enough for the above analysis.\n[17] Our results suggest that the background viscosity\nplays a role in the swell shape. This is different from\nthe lubrication theory [Olson, 1990] that suggests that the\nplume viscosity controls the plume dynamics. Ribe and\nChristensen [1994] showed that for this theory, far-down-\nstream W \/ (x \u00ff xp)\nm, with m = 1\/5, which fits their\nnumerical results for a (pressure-dependent) rheology with\nh0 = 10\n21 Pa s and E = 200 kJ\/mol. We fit the downstream\nparts of the scaled curves from Figure 3c to this powerlaw\nrelation, using a linear least-squares method. We find that\nm varies between approximately 0 to 0.4, depending on h0\nand E. This range envelopes the m = 1\/5 by Ribe and\nChristensen [1994].\n[18] Based on the same lubrication theory, Ribe and\nChristensen [1999] find that height and width scale as\ndr(Q\/s)1\/4G(\u0005b)\/(r0 \u00ff rw) and CWQ\n3\/4 s1\/4\/(UG(\u0005b)),\nrespectively, with Q = F\/dr, s = gdr\/(48hp), U the plate\nvelocity, hp the minimum plume viscosity, and G empirical\nfunction of the plume buoyancy parameter \u0005b = Qs\/U\n2.\nDue to model differences (rheology, bottom boundary\nconditions, and definitions of H and W), and different\nrheological parameter range, our results require a variation\nin G of more than a factor 3, and do not fit G = 1.26\ntanh(1.01 \u0002 10\u00ff2\u0005b + 0.687) proposed in [Ribe and\nChristensen, 1999]. Instead we find G(\u0005b) = 0.1 ln(98\u0005b\n+ 1), and CW = 1 to fit our data with a relative misfit of 7.8%\nand 7.1% for H and W, respectively. These misfits are\ncomparable to our scaling law, and are added to Figures 2b\nand 2c for Hmax and correspondingW. The function G might\nreflect a missing background viscosity term in the scaling.\nThis would correspond to previous work by Feighner and\nRichards [1995] who suggested that the plume viscosity\nalone does not properly describe the spreading of the plume\nmaterial. Furthermore, scaling of the data with the method in\n[Ribe and Christensen, 1999] and properly fitting G also\nshows similar fanning related to the background viscosity\nh0, as in Figures 3c and 3d. Our results and comparison\nwith [Ribe and Christensen, 1999] seem to suggest that\nlubrication theory describes the swell spreading well to first\norder, but a more accurate incorporation of the rheology is\nneeded to improve the fit of scaling laws to the data, and that\nthe background viscosity plays a significant role in it.\n[19] Acknowledgments.
