An \nopportunity exists to assist designers by expanding the capabilities of popular \nsimulation modelling tools, and using them as a vehicle to better consider human \nfactors during the process of manufacturing system design.  To support this \nrequirement, this paper reports on an extensive review of literature that develops \na theoretical framework which summarizess the principal factors and \nrelationships that such a modelling tool should incorporate. \nKeywords \nManufacturing, human factors, modelling, simulation, theoretical framework \n1 Introduction \nThe design and re-design of manufacturing systems is a challenging activity.  \nThe competitive environment is constantly changing and there appears to be an \ninsatiable demand to make products cheaper, better and faster.  In this \nenvironment, people who carry out somewhat repetitive manual production tasks \nseem to remain key to success (Womack et al. 1990, Parker and Wall 1996). \n Although this importance is widely recognized (Jaikumar 1986, Womack et al. \n1990), the factors which affect performance are less well understood. This is \nparticularly an issue within the process of manufacturing system design (Baines \nand Kay 2002).  Designers of manufacturing systems often have a scant \nappreciation of the wide range of factors that influence the performance of the \npeople who work within their factories. This can lead to their subsequent designs \nnot performing as expected, with the engineer frequently overestimating how \nefficiently or effectively people will work.  Some compensation can be made by \ntaking a conservative view of likely system performance, but this is a poor \nsubstitute for properly understanding the factors that determine such \nperformance. \nA key challenge in manufacturing system research is to improve the awareness \nof engineers about the impact that human factors have on their designs (Barroso \nand Wilson 1999, Bonney et al. 2000).  It is particularly desirable to improve this \nawareness early on in the design process, as many factors can be easily and \ninexpensively modified at this stage.  One tool for improving this awareness is \ncomputer based simulation modelling (Baines and Kay 2002, Baines et al. 2003).  \nThis technique is a popular and attractive aid to designers, currently allowing \nthem to experiment with many system variables including, for example, the \nnumber of people working on a production line, their shift patterns and task \npriorities.  If the capability of modelling can be further developed to enable \nassessment of some of the more significant human behavioural factors, this \n would be a valuable means of stimulating further consideration of these factors \nduring the design process. \nThe work described in this paper has, therefore, set out to develop the \nfoundations for a modelling tool that enables the assessment of key human \nfactors early in the process of manufacturing system design.  This theoretical \nframework has been formed through an extensive search and synthesis of \nliterature from a variety of sources. Described within this paper is the process \nused to form the framework, the framework itself, and how this can now enable \nthe construction of practical tools for engineers. The final sections describe future \nresearch that can now be based around this framework. \n2.  Background to the research  \n2.1 An appreciation of the industrial problem. \nHighly efficient production systems remain central to enabling cheaper, better \nand faster product manufacture (Slack et al. 2001).  However, the archetypal \nmass production system of Henry Ford is rarely seen in practice.  Market \npressures translate into ever increasing demands for wider product variety, \ncustomization, faster delivery, improved quality and reduced cost (Jaikumar \n1986).  Consequently, the modern flow-line production system is an attempt to \nidentify some similarities in product manufacture and to impose structure and \nroutine into these complex systems.  For example, anecdotal evidence suggests \nthat within a typical automotive factory as many as 5000 different permutations in \nproduct specification may be produced on a flow-line production system.  In this \nsituation manufacturing system design is an onerous task, yet such systems \n must be re-designed every time a new product is introduced.  Levels of financial \ninvestment can be immense (multi million pound), and the consequences of poor \ndesign can be significant.  If a system fails to perform as expected, it can cause \nsevere tension between planners and operators, and can lead to failure of the \nhost organization.  Many tactics can help to reduce the extent of failure, such as \nbuilding excess capacity into a design, involving system operators in the design \nprocess, and employing computer based modelling techniques such as Discrete \nEvent Simulation (Baines and Kay 2002). \nSimulation is very popular in industry.  It allows computer based models to be \nconstructed that emulate the behaviour of the proposed system (Robinson 1994).  \nThe software is easy and fun to use and small models can be constructed \nrelatively quickly.  However, simulation models can appear credible even when \nperformance predictions are unrealistic (Baines 1994).  Such errors depend on \nmany factors, such as the competence of the user and the complexity of the real \nsystem being modelled.  One particular issue is the assumption that workers \nwithin factories are highly predictable and standardized in their behaviour.  For \nexample, model builders (who are frequently engineers), tend to assume that \nworkers always start work on time, operate at a constant rate throughout the day, \ntake breaks at planned times etc. \nSuch regular behaviour of workers rarely occurs in practice.  Figure 1 is a time \nseries showing how the cycle time performance of a manual workstation varies.  \nThese are actual times taken from a real engine assembly operation within a UK \nbased automotive manufacturing organization.  The data were gathered \n electronically over 12 weeks, and this particular figure illustrates a typical 8 hour \nproduction slot.  Each data point shows the cycle time performance of an \nindividual worker, and each cluster represents different operatives at the work \nstation.  Hence, the time series shows the extent to which performance varies for \nworkers, and across workers, for a typical work station throughout an eight hour \nshift.  Also evident in this graph are the operator break times, which also vary \nfrom those planned.  Analysis of the data suggests that up to one third of the \npotential time for production is lost due to stoppages, extended breaks and \ndisruptions to the flow of the line, many of which may be caused by worker \nbehaviour.  In this study, such variance was apparent across several \nworkstations throughout the twelve week observation period.  In this same plant, \nwe also observed that the simulation models used to aid the design process \ntypically over estimated assembly line performance by 15 to 20%.  An important \nfactor in this gap between real and anticipated performance of the system is \nundoubtedly the assumption that worker performance is somewhat standardized, \nwhich as figure 1 illustrates is not the case in practice. \nInsert figure 1 about here \nA desirable improvement to simulation would be a more realistic representation \nof variations in human performance and ideally the human factors which \ninfluence these variations.  Baines and Kay (2002) show how such a capability \ncould be provided through a Human Performance Modelling tool that integrates \nwith computer based simulation, to support the process of manufacturing system \ndesign.  This is illustrated in figure 2.  Development of such a capability would \n have two principal benefits.  First, it would enable the creation of more valid \nmodels of manufacturing systems which would allow investment decisions to be \nmade with greater confidence.  Second, by enabling a greater consideration of \nhuman factors earlier in the systems design process, it would encourage \ndesigners to create working environments which are more sympathetic to high \nperformance of the work force. \nInsert figure 2 about here \nImproving simulation, however, is not simply a challenge to the information \ntechnology and computer programming community.  Currently available \nsimulation tools, such as Witness (Robinson et al. 2001), are quite capable of \nrepresenting a probability distribution of human performance.  The challenge is \nrather; to understand precisely where a variation in human performance should \nbe considered in a model of a manufacturing system; to appreciate the nature of \nsuch variation; and the factors that affect and amplify this variance.  Therefore, a \nfirst step in creating a human performance modelling capability is to determine a \ntheoretical framework that relates the performance of workers directly involved \nwith manufacturing tasks, with the key factors that influence this performance.  \nDeveloping such a framework is the topic of this paper. \n2.2 A review of current theoretical frameworks \nA variety of theoretical frameworks currently exists, and though none of these is \ntailored to the modelling challenge being addressed, they provide a valuable \ninsight into the form a suitable framework may take.  An overview of these \nframeworks is given in table 1.  The table details a multi-disciplinary collection of \n frameworks that show how a wide range of interrelated physical and \npsychosocial factors have been related to work performance outcomes pertaining \nto the worker, the organization and the work environment. Importantly, the table \nalso demonstrates that attempts have already been made to account for this \nwide range of factors in more elaborate theoretical models, and in some cases to \nintegrate these within frameworks for computer simulation modelling of human \nperformance. \nMany of the existing frameworks are quite general in nature.  One of the best \nknown generic frameworks was provided by Lewin (1935), who related the \nbehaviour of the individual to their environmental context and their individual \ncharacteristics.  Although this provides an excellent illustration of the scope of \nfactors and categories that need to be accounted for, it is too vague and broad \nfor direct application. Simlarly, Bonney et al. (2000) emphasizes the centrality of \ndirect workers to design outcomes in their framework but do not specify the \nhuman factors that should be considered. On the other hand, more elaborate \nmodels e.g. Das (1999) and Parker et al. (2001) do put forward more specific \npsychosocial and physical factors relating to the person and the organization, but \ntheir variables are often indefinable and intangible constructs that would be \ndifficult to quantify \/ evaluate in practice. A regular feature of these frameworks is \nthat they neglect to fully consider aspects of the physical environment, which can \nbe an important consideration within many factories. \nOn the other hand, more specific models that concentrate on particular \nantecedent variables or on specific behavioural outcomes are limited in scope. \n For example, Furnham\u2019s (1992) model proposes five basic categories of \n\u2018individual\u2019 factors (personality, intelligence, demographics, motivation, and \nability) that influence general \u2018occupational behaviour\u2019. However, by not \naccounting for effects of external factors (organizational \/ environmental), or \nspecifying the nature of particular factors within these categories (e.g. personality \ntype, gender, IQ, etc.), the model cannot be extrapolated to represent specific \nperformance antecedents or outcomes. It is, therefore, of limited practical use in \nthe representation of person-performance relationships in particular situations or \ncontexts - such as a manufacturing system. \nIn respect of models that are particularly related to the manufacturing system \ncontext, Miller and Swain\u2019s (1987) inventory of \u2018Performance-Shaping Factors\u2019 \naddresses a range of relevant environmental, organizational and individual \nfactors. However, these are only considered in relation to error-related \nperformance outcomes. Toriizuka (2001) has elaborated the Miller and Swain \nperformance shaping factors framework to improve work style, work efficiency \nand the comfort of work in the field of human reliability.  This model is, \nunfortunately, specifically for maintenance tasks which have their own unique \ncharacteristics. Similarly, whilst Stone and Eddy\u2019s (1996) factors are also \nexplicitly relevant to the manufacturing context, and reinforce the positive effects \nof person-organization fit, the framework is not directly suitable because it was \nspecifically developed for only quality-related performance outcomes. This model \nalso does not account for physical environment factors. \n A framework which focuses specifically on organizational factors was developed \nby Ichniowski and Shaw (1999).  They identified a set of Human Resource \nManagement (HRM) techniques which they considered to be typical of Japanese \nmanufacturing firms (job rotation, communication, orientation, payment systems, \nteams, recruitment\/screening and training).  They then classified the HRM \nsystems of 36 US steel finishing lines in terms of their adoption of these practices \nas \u2018traditional\u2019, \u2018low teamwork and communication\u2019, \u2018high teamwork and \ncommunication\u2019 and \u2018innovative\u2019.  They used regression analysis to relate the use \nof these practices to production, and found that the US firms with \u2018innovative\u2019 \nHRM practices had uptime and product quality equivalent to that of the Japanese \nfirms, while the \u2018traditional\u2019 US lines showed the worst relative performance.  \nHowever, the disadvantages of this framework (from the point of view of our \ncurrent study) are that it only includes HRM practices, ignoring other \norganizational and physical environmental factors, and that its performance \nmeasures are related to overall line performance rather than the effects on the \nbehaviour of individual workers. \nExisting frameworks that have been developed specifically for computer-based \nhuman performance simulations include the Integrated Performance Modelling \nEnvironment (IPME) framework co-developed by DERA Centre for Human \nSciences (UK), Micro Analysis and Design (US) and Defence and Civil Institute \nEnvironmental Medicine (Canada) (Dahn and Laughery 1997, Bunting and \nBelyavin 1999). This framework aims to represent human performance in \ncomplex environments within computer-based Discrete Event Simulation (DES) \n models using data drawn from empirical studies in the literature and from many \nmilitary laboratory based studies. However, although the framework accounts for \nphysical environmental factors it is mostly concerned with system performance \nas an amalgamation of individual performance and ignores the interaction and \nmediating effects of other variables (e.g. organizational) by applying \u2018micro \nmodels\u2019 in an additive manner. Alternatively, whilst the PECS (Physical \nconditions, Emotional state, Cognitive capabilities, Social status) (Schmidt 2000) \nhuman performance modelling framework does account for physical and social \/ \norganizational environments, it represents human processes and performance in \nsocial systems via group behaviours using autonomous agents. Thus, the \ngeneric framework does not, once again, provide a model of factors and \nfunctional relationships relevant to the performance variables of a manufacturing \nwork environment. \nThese frameworks exemplify the current research problem. Clearly, there is a \nneed for a simple framework which encapsulates the multitude of human factors \nthat need to be considered in manufacturing systems. Parker et al. (2001) assert \nthat a universal list of factors would probably be infinite - but that it should be \npossible to identify categories of variables in an \u2018overall guiding theoretical \nframework\u2019 that could be adapted and applied differently according to context. \nThe challenge for this research is to create such a guide that will be specifically \nappropriate to manufacturing system simulation. \n \nInsert table 1 about here \n 3. Research aim and methodology \n3.1 Overview of research aim and methodology \nThe aim of the research described in this paper has been to form a theoretical \nframework that will enable human performance modelling within the process of \nmanufacturing system design.  At this stage in our research we have limited our \nscope to \u2018direct workers\u2019 (Greener 1994), those people who carry out the \nsomewhat manual tasks within production, but whose activity is critical to the \noverall performance of a facility.  To achieve the aim, two principal questions are \nimmediately apparent.  First, what are the appropriate direct worker activities and \nassociated performance measures on which a framework should be based? \nSecond, what factors are most likely to have an impact on these measures? \nThe research methodology was structured to address each of these questions in \nturn.  The first stage investigated the ways in which a typical DES tool currently \ndeals with direct workers. A typical commercial modelling tool was studied in \ndetail, the procedure used to represent direct workers was assessed, and from \nthis the required measures of variations in human performance were identified.  \nThis approach is explained further in section 3.2. \nThe next step was then to identify the human factors which are most likely to \nhave an impact on these metrics in practice.  As many potential factors exist \nParker et al. 2001), a method of screening and ranking possible factors was \ndesigned. This method included an assessment of whether a factor was relevant \nto the performance metrics, whether it was measurable, and the probable extent \nto which it would affect worker performance.  An extensive literature search was \n then conducted to identify possible factors.  The starting point for the \ninvestigation of the factors was based on Kurt Lewin\u2019s field theory (Lewin 1935).  \nField theory, which is a very open framework, regards individual behaviour as the \noutcome of a dynamic system, in which factors relating to the individual interact \nwith elements of the environment, as shown in figure 3.  To guide this review, the \nliterature search was structured around factors relating to the individual and the \nworking environment.  On completion of this analysis, the factors and \nperformance measures were brought together to form the framework.  Section \n3.3 describes this procedure in greater detail. \nInsert figure 3 about here \n3.2 Procedure used for identifying relevant measures of direct worker \nperformance. \nThe first stage in the research was to determine the appropriate measures of \ndirect worker performance; in other words where within a simulation model of a \nmanufacturing system should distribution in human performance be considered?  \nWitness (Robinson et al. 2001) was chosen as a representative modelling tool, \nthis is based on the technique of DES and is very popular within industry.  On \ninvestigation it became apparent that within this tool a rather mechanistic \napproach is taken to modelling workers, for example: \n\u00b7 When workers are available in a model, they can be instantaneously \n\u2018called\u2019 by machines and will instantaneously respond unless they are held \nback by another machine. \n \u00b7 When called to a machine, the workers then perform at a constant rate. \n\u00b7 On completion of a task, a worker is \u2018released\u2019 and will instantaneously be \navailable to other resources. \n\u00b7 No production errors are attributed to the worker. \nAlthough each of these assumptions is a rather simplified view of worker \nbehaviour and performance, three important points must be stressed.  First, \nWitness is not unusual in the manner the tool treats workers; rather, we consider \nthis to be a very capable and credible product.  Second, these limitations are not \nsimply a software limitation; rather, they illustrate a fundamental lack of \nknowledge about worker interactions and performance.  Finally, representing \nworkers in this simplistic way, may only be an issue when model accuracy is of \nupmost importance.  Sometimes a model may be constructed simply to illustrate \na system in operation. Only when model accuracy is critical is a more realistic \nrepresentation of human performance necessary.  In this situation however, the \nfollowing considerations of human performance need to be incorporated in tools \nsuch as Witness: \n\u00b7 Dependability distribution: Given that all conditions for a worker to begin \na task are met, what delays occur prior to an operator responding to \ninstructions to start work? \n\u00b7 Activity time distribution: after a worker has started a task, how will the \nactivity time vary? \n \u00b7 Error rate distribution: how accurately and reliably does an operator carry \nout a task? Errors are any deviation from product specification, which \nmay result in unserviceable product (\u2018scrap\u2019) or product which requires \nadditional processing to become serviceable (\u2018rework\u2019). \nIn addition to addressing these three major variations in worker performance, if a \nmodel is run over an extended period other issues that should also be \nconsidered include: \n\u00b7 Absenteeism rate: how consistent does a person participate in the work \nactivity over an extended period?  Absence from the workplace can \noccur for many reasons such as official leave, such as allowances for \nchild birth, bereavement, training etc, as well as statutory sick leave. \n\u00b7 Accident rate: how safely does an operator carry out their work? A \nnumber of accident types can be identified, e.g. those caused by human \nerror that result in personal injury, and those caused by human error that \nresult in damage to plant, buildings, or equipment. \n\u00b7 Staff turnover rate:  How constant is worker engagement? The number of \nemployees starting (or finishing) employment at a particular place of work \nover a given period, and the associated impact of \u2018green\u2019 labour. \nOn this basis, there are six important variations in human performance that ought \nto be considered in a model of a manufacturing system.  In the remainder of this \npaper we refer to these as the Human Performance Variation Metrics, and move \non to explore the key factors that affect these. \n 3.3 Procedure used for identifying key human related factors \nThe second stage of the research was to identify those key human related \nfactors which are most likely to cause variation in the six human performance \nvariation metrics.  As outlined in section 3.1, the approach taken to identifying \nthese key factors was first to conduct a large scale identification of relevant \nliterature, and then to apply a method of screening.  The literature search was \ncarried out in a variety of areas, including manufacturing management, applied \npsychology, social psychology, ergonomics, human factors, behavioural \nmedicine, applied physiology, health and safety, environmental medicine, \nmanagement science, organizational studies, economics, industrial relations, \nhuman resources management and occupational psychology. Over 800 \nreferences were considered overall.   Each of these papers was in some way \nconcerned with a factor which has been found to have some impact on human \nperformance.  Each paper was then screened on the basis of the following four \ncriteria: \n\u00b7 General relevance: Is there evidence in the paper that the factors \nconsidered are related to the performance of people conducting manual \nand repetitive activities? \n\u00b7 Specific relevance: Is the factor related to manual production work and\/or \nlikely to be directly related to the human performance variation metrics? \n\u00b7 Robustness: Is the literature consistent in terms of the impact of the \nfactor?  Are the sources quoted reliable and based on credible, robust \nempirical studies? \n \u00b7 Measurability: Can the factor be reliably and consistently assessed? \nThe screening was carried out by assessing each paper in turn against the four \ncriteria outlined above.  Once an initial screening had been made to reduce the \nrange of papers being considered, a secondary assessment was then conducted \nto score and rank papers.   The scoring process was based on a scale of 0 \u2013 4.  \nHere a score of \u20194\u2019 meant that the factor satisified the factor very well, and where \n\u20180\u2019 meant that the factor did not satisfy the criteria in any way. \nThis screening identified a total of 65 potential factors for inclusion in the \ntheoretical framework.  These fell into three categories; factors relating to the \nindividual worker, factors relating to the physical working environment, and \nfactors concerned with the organizational working structure.  In the remainder of \nthis paper we refer to these as the key human centred factors.  These combine \nwith the human performance variation metrics to give the outline of modelling \ncapability.  The actual factors chosen is given in table 2,  with an overview of the \ndebate involved in each case given below. \n5. Key human centred factors \nThis section gives a summary of the considerations made in each of the three \ncategories of key human centred factors. \n \n5.1 Factors about the individual. \nFactors in the literature relating to the person themselves comprised a diverse \nrange of \u2018state\u2019 and \u2018trait\u2019 variables spanning six major categories: personality, \ndemographics, physiology, cognition, motivation and skills.  They can relate to \nperformance in a number of ways.  For example, \u2018trait\u2019 cognitive ability can \n contribute directly to overall job performance, in all areas of work, through its \neffects on knowledge and skills acquisition (Ree et al. 1994).  Similiarly,  \nmotivation \u2018states\u2019 such as job satisfaction have been found related to \nperformance via job characteristics (Hackman and Oldham, 1976). \nThe process of assessing these factors was complex and extremely difficult.  \nSome factors performed well against the screening process.  Here, the \nintelligence factor \u2018general cognitive ability\u2019 (\u2018g\u2019) and the personality dimension of \n\u2018conscientiousness\u2019 scored most highly across the scoring criteria, being \nstraightforward to measure and supported by robust literature indicating that \nthese are the factors most strongly related to work performance (Viswesvaren \nand Ones 2000) for both individual and organizational outcomes (Miller et al. \n1999). Other personality traits scored highly for being easily measurable and \nrelated to work performance, although this tended to be in relation to specific \ntypes or aspects of work, for example interpersonal skills (Mount et al.1998), \ntraining (Barrick and Mount 1991), and  turnover (Barrick et al. 1994). In addition \nto \u2018trait\u2019 characteristic variables, several \u2018state\u2019 and attitudinal factors scored \nhighly for being associated with work performance via motivations.  For example, \norganizational commitment (Van Scotter 2000, Suliman and Iles 2000) and job \nsatisfaction (Hackman and Oldman, 1976) scored particularly highly across the \ncriteria, followed by a variety of combined work-related attitudes and beliefs. \nHowever, although basic demographics, such as age and gender, could be \nscored highly in terms of measurability and relevance to work performance \n(Ilmarenen 1994), most of the demographic and physiological factors received \n very low scores against the selection criteria.  This was because certain factors \nwere supported by little evidence to suggest a relevance to manufacturing \nproductivity and \/ or were found particularly difficult to measure. \n5.2 Factors about the physical environment \nPhysical environmental factors in the literature cover the areas of noise, \nvibration, light and indoor air quality (including air temperature and humidity).  For \nexample, considerable literature has existed for sometime that observes the \nimpact of noise level upon performance measures such as productivity (Weston \nand Adams 1932), error rate (Broadbent and Little 1960, Nowier 1984) and \naccidents (Heald 1955), depending on the nature of the task (Levy-Leboyer and \nMoser 1988).  Another factor relating to the physical working environment is \nindoor air quality, which has been identified by the US Government \nEnvironmental Protection Agency as potentially more significant in its health \neffects than outdoor air pollution (EPA 2001).  The effects on workers of different \nchemical species of air pollution have been researched, for example carbon \ndioxide (Scheff et al. 2000), carbon monoxide (LaBar 1991) and ozone (Gliner et \nal. 1980). \nDuring the screening process, the results were sometimes quite surprising.  For \nexample, there was evidence from the literature that noise affects general worker \nperformance (Glass and Singer 1972), but the evidence was not overly robust, \nbeing dependent on a single paper only.  Research into the effects of vibration, \non the other hand, is relatively extensive (e.g. Griffin and Lewis 1978, Fahy and \n Walker 1998, Jones 1992), but largely inconclusive (Oborne 1995, Griffin and \nLewis 1978) and highly context specific. \nAir temperature is also clearly significant, with extensive literature to support its \nrelevance.  For example, U.S.DOHHS, 1992, Meese et al. 1984 and Parsons, \n2000, all demonstrate effects of temperature or humidity upon performance at \nwork.  Equipment for measuring temperature is also easily available, making the \nprocess of gathering data on temperature relatively simple.  Light level is another \nsignificant factor and several cases identify the potential benefits and pitfalls that \ncan be achieved from various lighting levels at work (e.g. Steelcase 1999, Dul \nand Weerdmeester 1993 and Gilbert and Hopkinson 1949). Measuring and \nrecording light levels is also relatively easy to carry out. \n5.3  Factors about the organizational environment \nOrganizational environmental factors relate to organizational structure, culture \nand human resources practices.  Structural factors such as shift work (Monk and \nFolkard 1992) and organizational hierarchy (Woodward et al. 1965) have been \nwidely studied and established as affecting worker productivity.  Changing \nattitudes to the management of manufacturing systems in the last two decades of \nthe twentieth century have led to an increasing awareness of the importance of \nhuman resources management (Snell and Dean 1992) and a large number of \nempirical studies of the effectiveness of policies relating to worker empowerment, \nsuch as team working (Knights 2000), training (Barrett and O\u2019Connell 2001) and \nrecruitment (Ichniowski and Shaw 1999). \n A number of organizational factors were rejected through screening.  For \nexample, from the literature it can be seen that the impact of payment systems \non worker productivity is controversial.  Some authors argue that pay is more \noften associated with factors such as job level and seniority than performance \n(Lawler 1975), and that incentive schemes rarely have the desired effect and \nmay be counter-productive (Kohn 1993), although others dispute this (Luthans \nand Stajkovic 1999).  In addition, the effectiveness of payment schemes may be \nhard to measure, because they apply to the workforce as a whole, and hence \ntheir impact on individual worker performance cannot be evaluated.  This \ndifficulty also applies to other organizational factors, such as recruitment and \nemployment security. \nA most significant organizational variable is shift work, the effects of which are \ndocumented by a considerable literature (e.g. Monk and Folkard 1992, Akerstedt \nand Landstrom 1995, Hossain and Shapiro 1999, and Marquie and Foret 1999).  \nThis factor can be \u2018measured\u2019 by comparing variations in productivity between \ndifferent shifts.  Team working is also important (see e.g. Kolasa 1975, \nIchniowski and Shaw 1999, Dunphy and Bryant 1996), and the effects may be \nmeasured by looking at differences in productivity between teams. \n \n6. Formation of the theoretical framework \nThe screening of factors involved a degree of subjective judgement, particularly \nin assigning values for the scores and in ranking.  This was inevitable given the \nnature of the problem.  However, the process that was followed provided a way \n of making the subjective judgements explicit and thus open to review.  Scores \nwere assigned, discussed and reviewed by members of the research team, \nrather than a single individual, to ensure that a convincing case could be made \nfor each score. In the absence of a more objective method of assessing the \nfactors, this was felt to be the most satisfactory approach available.  The ranking \nof human centred factors then provided a basis for the formation of the \ntheoretical framework.  The inventory of ranked factors, however, still consisted \nof 65 potential variables, which was considered to be too many for inclusion into \na framework which would eventually be used in practice.  Consequently, the \nranking was examined carefully and a clear cut-off point was established by \nlooking for natural groupings, especially against the criteria of relevance and \nmeasurability.  In this way, thirty key factors were finally identified, and these are \nshown in the shaded area of table 2. \nInsert table 2 about here \nThe key factors identified by this process provide a comprehensive picture of the \nfactors that are most likely to influence a person carrying out production tasks.  \nThese factors range from the individual\u2019s personality, intelligence and \ndemographic characteristics to the physical setting of the workplace and the \ncharacteristics of the organization.  The original framework derived from Lewin\u2019s \nmodel, as illustrated in figure 3, was first expanded using the three sets of key \nhuman centred factors, and then expanded further to include the human \nperformance variation metrics established in section 3.2. This is illustrated in \nfigure 4. \n Insert figure 4 about here \nThe theoretical framework offers a qualitative representation of the determinants \nof worker performance.  The final element of the theoretical framework is the set \nof functional relationships, which describe the effects on the performance \nmeasures of changes in the key variables. At this stage of our research, it is only \npossible to offer hypothetical relationships between the key factors and the \nperformance measures, of the generic form shown in equation (1), where DVj \n(j=1-30) is a change in the value of a key variable and DPij (i=1-6, j=1-30) is the \nresultant change in the value of a performance variable.   \nDPij = \u00a6(DVj)  (1) \nAlthough the general form of some of these relationships can be gleaned from \nthe literature (for example, the impact of age on cycle time), their precise nature \nhas yet to be established.  This therefore is the future challenge in creating a \nhuman performance modelling capability within the process of manufacturing \nsystems design.   \n7. Concluding remarks and future work \nThe aim of the research described in this paper has been to form a theoretical \nframework to conceptually enable human performance modelling as an aid to \nmanufacturing system design. \nThe next stage in the development of a modelling tool is the elaboration of the \nfunctional relationships in the manufacturing context, and the work described \nhere will provide a structure around which such a study can be designed.  The \n theoretical framework will provide a means of hypothesising the relationships that \nneed to be sought in order to begin to form a modelling tool.  This research will \nneed to be conducted in a real manufacturing environment, and there will be \nseveral significant challenges to be overcome.  For example, we may find that \nsome of the key variables in our framework are simply too controversial to \nmeasure in practice, such as attempting to relate age, gender or IQ to \nperformance.  We may therefore be forced to consider rationalizing our \nframework further to make it workable in practice.  Also, experiment design will \nneed to overcome issues associated with worker performance being impacted by \nan intrusive experimentation procedure, classically associated with the \nHawthorne Effect.   \nSuch barriers mean that the future for research in this field is likely to be a stream \nof interrelated projects which incrementally develop theory and practice.  The \ngoal is simply a noble attempt to entice engineers to more carefully consider \nhuman factors, early in the design process, and using simulation as a vehicle to \nrealise this goal.  It may take a several research initiatives before even a limited \nmodelling capability is available, and this may be based on a very much smaller \nset of factors than those presented in this paper.  Nevertheless, the work \ndescribed here is an essential step in developing this capability, as it attempts to \norder and prioritise those factors that clearly should be considered in the next \nphase of research, and those that for the moment need not be considered \nfurther. \n  \nAcknowledgements \nThis research is sponsored by the Ford Motor Company and supported by \nEPSRC through the Innovative Manufacturing Research Centre at Cranfield.  \nThe authors would like to gratefully acknowledge the support and contribution of \ntheir colleagues, Dr Val Vitanov, Professor John Kay, Steve Mason and Peer \nSiebers of Cranfield University, and John Ladbrook of Ford Motor Company. \nReferences  \nAKERSTEDT, T. and LANDSTROM, U, 1995, Work place countermeasures of \nnight shift fatigue.
