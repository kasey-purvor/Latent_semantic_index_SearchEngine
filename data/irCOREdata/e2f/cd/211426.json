The  principal  component  analysis  (PCA)  is  \u201ca  statistical  technique  that  linearly  transforms  an original set of variables into a substantially smaller set of uncorrelated variables that represents most of the information in the original set of variables: (\u2026) a smaller set of uncorrelated variables is much easier to understand and use in further analysis than a larger set of correlated variables\u201d (Duntenam, 1989 p.9). Through the PCA the original variables (in the case of our analysis the variables  shown  in  literature  as  representative  of  the  socio-economic  disadvantage  of  the  EU regions) are linearly combined by means of a set of \u201cweights\u201d (a1, a2, \u2026, ak)  calculated in order to maximise (under the constraint of that the sum of the squared weights is equal to one) the variability of the resulting indicator, i.e of the principal component (our Social Factors variable). Consequently the i-th principal component is: yi=ai1x1+ ai2x2+\u2026+aipxp where (ai1,ai2 aip) are the wights and   x1, x2, \u2026 ,xk are the k variables. It  is  possible  to  calculate  as  many  PCs  as  the  original  variables  under  the  constraint  of  noncorrelation  with  the  previous  ones.  Anyway  the  PCs  are  able  to  account  for  a  progressively decreasing amount of the total variance of the original variables. Consequently, the procedure allow us  to  concentrate  our  attention  on  the  first  and  limited  number  of  PCs,  which  are  the  most representative of the phenomenon under analysis.","cites":null},{"id":17218782,"title":"Are European regional policies delivering?","authors":[],"date":"1999","doi":null,"raw":"Martin P.

ISSN 0034-3404 \n \n \nAbstract \nThis paper sets out to analyse the regional policy of the European Union by assessing whether the \nactual distribution of funds to the regions undermines the principle of territorial concentration. The \nempirical analysis shows that, due to either political equilibriums or inaccurate assumptions about \nthe most cost-effective allocation of the funds, the sources of structural disadvantage are more \nspatially concentrated than the funds devoted to compensating this disadvantage and reveals a weak \nassociation between socio-economic disadvantage and EU funding. Corrections in allocation \nmechanisms are recommended in order to increase fund concentration and more adequately earmark \nresources to disadvantaged regions. \n  \nKeywords: Regional Policy, Regional development, socio-economic factors, European Union, \nRegions, Economic Growth \n \nJEL Classifications: C24, O18, R11, R58\n 2  \n \n1.0 Introduction \nThe debate over the EU budget 2007-2013 made clear the need for an in-depth understanding of the \nstructure and the impact of EU development funds. A more effective targeting of the scarce regional \nresources in response to the real needs of EU countries and regions would deliver greater results \u2013 \nand justify this use of public money \u2013 especially at a time when the eastward enlargement of the EU \nis, on the one hand, reducing the available resources in comparison to the target areas and, on the \nother, increasing economic disparities across member states. The urgency for a highly cost\/effective \nEU regional policy has stimulated a significant amount of scientific work aiming at assessing the \nstructure, implementation and impact of the policy and identifying potential room for further \nimprovement. As suggested by Batchtler and Wren (2006): \u201cDuring the past 15 years, the Cohesion \nPolicy of the European Union has become one of the most intensively evaluated policies in Europe\u201d \n(p.143). However, notwithstanding this activity, major methodological barriers have prevented the \nliterature from reaching a consensus on the magnitude of the impact of structural funds on territorial \ncohesion (Bradley, 2006). In particular what makes it conceptually hard for \u201cmacro-models\u201d to \nextract the pure impact of structural expenditure from the \u201cbackground of all the other domestic and \nexternal shocks that affect the economy at the same time\u201d (Bradley p.189), is the lack of  an \nappropriate counterfactual scenario (\u201dwhat would have happened without an active regional policy? \nCould even more inequalities have possibly arisen?\u201d). Such counterfactual analysis while crucial for \nany policy assessment (Colin and Wren, 1999; Wren, 2005), is hard to construct and heavily \ndependent upon the assumptions that underlie it. In addition there are also major difficulties \nassociated with the quality of the data available for any evaluation exercise (Basl\u00e9, 2006; Martin \nand Tyler 2006). \nOn the basis of these considerations this paper has approached the assessment of the EU structural \npolicy from a different standpoint i.e. by focusing its attention upon the \u00e0 priori structure of the \npolicy rather than upon its impact. In so doing, the paper focuses its attention on one of the \u201ccore \n 3  \nprinciples\u201d of the structural funds since the 1989 reform: concentration and, in particular, territorial \nconcentration. In 2004 the publication of the Third Cohesion Report (CEC 2004) presented \nconcentration, together with programming and partnership as the \u201ccore principles\u201d FOR improving \nthe effectiveness of structural expenditure. However, the same report concluded that, as concerns \nconcentration, \u201cin the sense of focusing funds on the areas most in need,  (\u2026) evaluations suggest \nthat resources are still sometimes spread too widely and thinly\u201d (CEC 2004 p.xxii). In this \nperspective this paper  sets out to test the existence of an \u00e0 priori bias in the geographical allocation \nof the funds that undermines the principle of concentration and prevents intervention from fully \ntargeting the real sources of competitive disadvantage of the EU regions. In line with this objective \nthe paper analyses the regional allocation of the EU funds in order to assess whether (and to what \nextent) it is consistent with the factors that have been shown to hamper the local economy\u2019s \ncapability to grow and develop at an adequate pace. In order to reach this objective the paper aims \nat bringing together two separate strands of literature: the literature on the analysis of the regional \npolicies of the EU and that on the role of underling socio-economic conditions in explaining \ndifferential regional growth performance. While the results of some of the former are biased by the \ncounterfactual problem discussed above, the latter has rarely been fully exploited for the purpose of \ndrawing direct economic policy implications.  \nThis paper aims at filling the gap between these two strands of literature by directly comparing the \nsocio-economic preconditions for successful regional development with the correlated allocation of \nstructural funds. On the basis of the evidence provided by the literature and in order to maximise its \nchance of success, EU regional funds should be allocated according to the geography of such \nsources of competitive disadvantage. In other words, given that a set of socio-economic conditions \nhave been shown to be factors hampering the economic success of many EU regions, the EU funds \nshould be allocated in order to \u201ccompensate\u201d the structural disadvantage of the assisted areas.  \n 4  \nThis paper aims at assessing precisely this potential bias in the geographical allocation of the \nstructural funds (Objective 1 and 2) in both the 1994-1999 and 2000-2006 programming periods1 in \norder to shed some light on the coherence of the policy hitherto pursued and draw some \nimplications for the future evolution of European regional policy.  \nMore specifically, in this paper:  \na) the spatial concentration of structural expenditure is analysed. A low degree of spatial \nconcentration of regional funds would contradict the principle of territorial concentration \nintroduced in the 1989 reform of the funds as an important prerequisite for their \neffectiveness; \nb) the spatial concentration of EU funds is contrasted with an indicator of the socio-economic \ndisadvantage of the EU regions. This analysis will allow us to investigate the coherence of \nthe EU regional policies in terms of the structural disadvantage of EU regions thus \nuncovering a potential inconsistency between policy objectives (favouring disadvantaged \nareas) and the beneficiaries of the funds; \nc)  an empirical model to assess to what extent regional funds are, in fact, associated (in a \nstatistically significant way) with the above-mentioned sources of competitive disadvantage \nis developed; \nd) a simple convergence analysis is pursued in order to show that increasing the concentration \nof the funds and investing in the most disadvantaged areas could be the best strategy to \npromote cohesion. \nA weak territorial concentration and a reduced correlation between the geographical allocation of \nthe funds and the structural disadvantage would suggest that even before their operational \ntranslation into actual development policies, the impact of the funds may have been reduced by  the \ninability to correctly select their targets i.e. the regions where socio-economic disadvantage is more \nsevere. \n                                                 \n1\n As will be discussed when presenting the dataset, major data limitations prevented us from including the 1989-93 \nprogramming period. \n \n 5  \n \nThis paper is organized into five further sections. In the first section the approach adopted in the \npaper will be placed in the context of the academic literature on EU regional policy thus showing \nhow the analysis of the spatial allocation of the funds can highlight inconsistencies in the structure \nof the policy that existing analyses have overlooked. In addition, the sources of regional socio-\neconomic disadvantage identified by the literature on regional growth in the EU are briefly \nreviewed thus allowing us to single out some simple indicators to be used as a benchmark for the \nassessment of the correlation between structural funds and needs of the regions. In the second \nsection the methodology followed to assess the spatial structure of both funds and socio-economic \ndisadvantage is presented and an empirical model to measure the correlation between regional funds \nand socio-economic disadvantage outlined. In the third section the empirical results are discussed. \nThe fourth section discusses some implications for the design of regional policies. The final section \nsets out some conclusions. \n 6  \n2.0 Regional policy and structural disadvantage \n2.1 The EU regional policy, its objectives and the inconsistencies potentially reducing its \nimpact \nThe European Community Treaty states that \u201c(\u2026) the Community shall aim at reducing the \ndisparities between the levels of development of the various regions and the backwardness of the \nleast favoured regions or islands, including rural areas\u201d (Article 158). The same objective is \nincluded in the EU draft Constitution (article III-220).  \nThe financial resources devoted to the pursuit of this objective have grown substantially over the \nyears: from ECU 68 billion (at 1997 prices) allocated by the Brussels European Council in 1988 for \nthe 1989-1993 period to the Euro 195 billion (at 1999 prices) of the 2000-2006 programming \nperiod2 (European Commission website). Altogether the expenditure for regional policy is \nparticularly significant when assessed as a percentage of the GDP of many lagging regions: 2.7% \n(of national GDP) in Greece, 2.8% in Portugal, 1% in Spain, 0.7% in Ireland in the year 2000 (E.C. \n2000).  \nHowever, even if the amount of resources devoted to the objective of promoting an \u201coverall \nharmonious development\u201d of the Union has not been negligible, the empirical literature has been \nunable to reach a consensus on the influence that the expenditure of such resources has had on  the \nactual level of territorial cohesion of the EU. Although a comprehensive review of the terms of this \ndebate lies outside the scope of this paper, we shall, nevertheless, refer to some of these empirical \nanalyses - irrespective of their final conclusions on actual policy impact \u2013 in order to highlight the \nfactors that may have prevented the policy from maximising its impact on territorial cohesion.  \nWhile Leonardi (2006) finds that the policy has \u201cfavoured the convergence of less developed \nregions toward the EU mean in terms of annual economic growth, employment level and \nunemployment between 1988 and 1999 and thereafter\u201d (p.164) with a general trend towards \nconvergence both at the national and at the regional level, Martin and Tyler (2006) \u2013 where \n                                                 \n2\n  In addition the Cohesion Fund distributes resources for about \u20ac2.5 billion per year from 2000 to 2006, for a \ntotal of \u20ac18 billion (at 1999 prices). \n \n 7  \nassessing the possible effect of the policy on cumulative regional employment by explicitly \naddressing the counterfactual problem -  conclude that \u201cat the very worst, the Structural Funds may \nhave helped to prevent a further widening of employment gap between the Objective 1 regions and \nthe prosperous regions\u201d (p.209). Conversely, other authors have emphasized both the lack of \nupward mobility of Objective 1 regions (which remained almost the same between 1989 and 2005 \nwith a few exceptions3) and the absence of convergence across EU regions in contrast with the \nconvergence observed across the member states that dominated the past twenty-five years of \nEuropean growth  (Boldrin and Canova, 2001; Magrini, 1999; Puga, 2002): a process of \u201cclub \nconvergence\u201d would seem to be in place across the EU regions, leading to the formation of clusters \nof regions with persistently different income levels (Canova, 2004; Quah, 1996 and 1997). \nIn the light of this debate, some empirical studies have attempted to explicitly address the different \nfactors that may influence the capacity of regional policy to deliver its intended benefits, by \nproviding an important tool for the improvement of actual policies. Midelfart-Knarvik and Overman \n(2002)\u2019s analysis highlights the potential distortion generated by structural funds on the location \ndecisions of R&D intensive firms. Structural funds provide an incentive for firms to locate in \nassisted regions with a poor endowment of human capital,  producing an inefficient outcome for \nboth firms (that cannot benefit from an adequate labour pool in the local area) and workers (who do \nnot benefit from an increase in labour demand due to the skill mismatch). Thus, EU aid should be \nfocused \u201con helping regions change their endowments and specialize according to the resulting \ncomparative advantage\u201d (p.352). Albeit produced using different theoretical frameworks4, this \nevidence is not far removed from the results of Cappelen et al. (2003), who conclude that the impact \nof structural funds is positive but \u201ccrucially dependent on the receptiveness of the receiving \nenvironment\u201d (p.640). In line with these results, Bondonio and Greenbaum (2006) find that \n                                                 \n3\n  Abruzzo (Italy) lost its Objective 1 status in 1997. A few regions and areas lost their Objective 1 status with \nthe 2000-2006 programming period but  received transitional support under Objective 1 of the Structural Funds for the \nperiod from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2005 or 2006 (Commission Decision 1999\/502\/EC). \n \n4\n  While Midelfart-Knarvik and Overman (2002) focus on the determinants of firms\u2019 location, Cappelen et al. \n(2003) develop a \u201cnew growth theory\u201d model with a Schumpeterian perspective. \n 8  \nObjective 2 programmes have proven more effective where pre-policy disadvantage is less \naccentuated. These findings emphasize the role of relatively more favourable contextual \nconditions\/endowments, which in turn, lead to a paradoxical situation whereby EU funds fail to \nwork precisely where they are most needed.  \nRodr\u00edguez-Pose and Fratesi (2004) by more directly assessing the impact of structural funds on \nregional growth performance, find that such an impact crucially depends on the distribution of \nresources across development axes. The closer fund allocation addresses contextual conditions, i.e. \nby being channelled towards human capital enhancement, the more its effects tend to be positive \nand significant while this is not the case when other objectives are pursued (i.e. infrastructure \ndevelopment).  \nThe evidence briefly reviewed above suggests the potential efficiency-loss caused by any \n\u201coperational\u201d mismatch between policy targets and the real needs of the lagging regions when \nfinancial resources are divided among the different axes and then translated into concrete actions. In \nthis paper we aim to contribute to this debate by, instead, analysing the potential \u201cspatial\u201d \nmismatches between areas where the factors of disadvantage are concentrated and areas where the \nresources  are being channelled by a policy design which may \u00e0 priori reduce the funds\u2019 capability \nof delivering the expected benefits and tackling the \u201cstructural deficiencies in key factors of \ncompetitiveness\u201d  (CEC 2004). As a consequence, the paper will follow the existing literature and \ncontribute to the ongoing debate by assessing a specific potential weakness of the EU regional \npolicy and suggesting how potential improvements can be made. This will be done from a \nperspective that tends to  be overlooked by the existing literature i.e. by focusing on the \u00e0 priori \nallocation of the funds rather than on their ex-post impact. The empirical analysis of the \nconvergence process of the EU regions will bring to light the importance of an allocation of funds \nthat really reflects the actual socio-economic disadvantage (or \u201cstructural deficiencies\u201d in \nCommission\u2019s words) of the EU regions. \n \n 9  \n \n \n2.2 Territorial concentration and correlation with structural disadvantage: a necessary pre-\ncondition for policy impact. \nStructural funds are designed to foster economic and social cohesion in the EU by promoting the \neconomic development of lagging regions (Objective 1) and assisting economic and social \nrestructuring in areas experiencing structural difficulties (Objective 2). However, \u201csince 1994 the \nconnection between poor nations and structural spending has been greatly diluted (as) large parts of \nFinland and Sweden were designated as eligible, and even some Austrian regions, together with all \nof the former East Germany\u201d (Baldwin and Wyplosz, 2006, p.242). This process may be the result \nof the tendency of spatially targeted policy to spread and lose focus over time (Greenbaum and \nBondonio, 2004), thus suggesting that \u201cwhile making territorial discriminations, EU cohesion \npolicy (\u2026) has essentially been a policy for economic and social development for much of the last \n30 years\u201d (Bachtler and Polverari, 2007, p. 107).  It was the pressure for setting aside budget \nresources aimed at financing the eastward enlargement of the EU that forced a reduction in both the \nareas eligible for assistance and community initiatives in the Agenda 2000 reform of the structural \nfunds  (Armstrong, 2001). Such a reduction was explicitly inspired by the principle of territorial and \nfinancial concentration: i.e. the relatively scarce resources for the EU regional policies should be \nchannelled more specifically to where they are most needed in order to maximise their \neffectiveness. Over time the need for an increase in the geographical concentration of the structural \nfunds expenditure has become progressively more apparent and \u201cconcentration\u201d has been re-\nasserted, within the \u201cframework for cohesion policy 2007-2013\u201d, among the key leading principles \nfor the new programming period5.  \nBut why is geographical concentration so important for the impact of the policy? Intuitively a \nsmaller number of beneficiaries may allow a larger amount of resources to flow in selected regions. \n                                                 \n5\n COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION, Brussels, 05.07.2005 COM(2005) 0299, \u201cCohesion Policy in \nSupport of Growth and Jobs: Community Strategic Guidelines, 2007-2013\u201d, p.8. \n 10  \nHowever, not only is the level of expenditure in the objective region relevant in itself  but also that \nin its neighbouring regions (Dall\u2019Erba, 2005). By this we mean that the spatial externalities \nproduced by the implementation of regional development programmes of whatever nature need to \nbe taken into account because an insufficient spatial \u201cconcentration\u201d of the funds may decrease their \nimpact by reducing the amount of such externalities \u201cflowing\u201d within the assisted areas. In this \nrespect Bradley (2006) highlights that without such external effects  there is no evidence of long \nterm benefits from the structural funds: Structural Funds (SFs) externalities boost the impact of the \nSFs programmes while \u201cbenefits from structural funds in isolation  are modest thus drawing \nattention to the fact that the real, long-term benefits of the SFs are more likely to  be associated with \nthe way in which each of the lagging economies responds to opportunities arising in the rest of the \nEU\u201d (p.197). \nIn addition, the importance of the \u201ccapacity to respond\u201d to external opportunities suggest that the \nspatial structure of the funds needs to be assessed in combination with the underlying socio-\neconomic conditions of the assisted regions. In order to maximise their impact the funds should be \ndirected where persistent factors of disadvantage prevent the local economy from fully expressing \nits potential (Mairate 2006) i.e. the geography of the funds should reflect as much as possible the \ngeography of the structural disadvantage of the EU regions.  \n \n2.3 Where are the funds most needed? Evidence from the literature. \nA specific set of factors has been shown by the literature to act as structural sources of competitive \ndisadvantage for the local economy. Lagging regions in the EU, notwithstanding their, in many \nrespects, profound differences, share a common set of analogous social conditions whose role is \nemphasized by the economic restructuring accelerated by the process of European integration  \n(Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, 1998a). While some economic factors (such as capital and technology) seem more \nable to adjust to the challenges of the EU integration (by virtue of their relatively higher mobility), \nsocial structures tend to be much less flexible. Consequently, it is possible to identify a specific set \n 11  \nof \u201cstructural\u201d conditions that are persistently associated with poor economic performance and \nwhich are very slow to adjust themselves endogenously. These factors concern, to different extents, \nfeatures of the labour force, the employment of local resources, demographic structure and change, \nand the accumulation and quality of human capital (Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, 1998b). \nHowever, the distinctive role of underling socio-economic conditions must be assessed in a \ntheoretical framework where, in line with the Lisbon Agenda6, innovation is explicitly considered \nthe driving force for growth. The objective of an innovation-based growth model for the Union has \nguided the implementation of the EU structural policies and the assessment of their results since the \nyear 2000. With the drawing up of the Community Strategic Guidelines \u201cCohesion Policy in \nSupport of Growth and Jobs: Community Strategic Guidelines, 2007-2013\u201d - which set out a \nframework for new programmes for the current programming period - \u201cknowledge, innovation and \nthe optimisation of human capital\u201d are explicitly assumed as means whereby Europe can \u201crenew the \nbasis of its competitiveness, increase its growth potential and its productivity and strengthen social \ncohesion\u201d (Presidency conclusions, European Council, March 2005 and incipit of the above-\nmentioned Community Strategic Guidelines). In addition the role played by the cohesion policy in \npursuing the Lisbon agenda has increased in 2007-2013 programming period Financial Perspective, \nwhich concentrated expenditure on the Lisbon objectives (Presidency conclusions, European \nCouncil, December 2005). \nIn this political framework a variety of contributions have reformulated Romer\u2019s endogenous \ngrowth model in order to explicitly recognise growth as a multivariate process where human capital \naccumulation but also sectoral specialisation of the labour force, migration, university education \n                                                 \n6\n The European Council, which met in Lisbon in 2000, set the goal of making the EU \u201cthe most competitive and \ndynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs \nand greater social cohesion\u201d (Presidency Conclusions, par. 5). The regional dimension of social cohesion is, together \nwith full employment, explicitly mentioned as the ultimate expected outcome of the strategy. Crucially, the Lisbon \nstrategy relies on the capability of knowledge to be translated into growth in order to deliver economic development. \nFurthermore, by focusing policy efforts on the creation and diffusion of knowledge, growth is not only supposed to be \nincreased but also qualitatively improved in terms of sustainability, quality of employment, and (social and regional) \ncohesion.   \n \n 12  \nand geographical location emerge as relevant factors for economic performance (Fagerberg et al. \n1997; Cheshire and Magrini, 2000).  \nMore generally, the role of socio-economic conditions in the translation of innovation into regional \ngrowth has been treated in a systematic way by the introduction of the concept of the \u201csocial filter\u201d \n(Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, 1999): the interaction of a complex set of economic, social, political and \ninstitutional features that makes some regions \u201cprone\u201d and others \u201caverse\u201d to innovation.  \nIn line with the evidence produced by this strand of literature, the multifaceted socio-economic \nconditions of the EU regions are introduced in our analysis by means of a set of variables describing \nthe local socio-economic realm. Innovation averse socio-economic conditions, by persistently \nhampering the growth capabilities of some areas, trace out the geography of the structural \ndisadvantage of the EU territories (Rodr\u00edguez-Pose and Crescenzi 2008; and Crescenzi, Rodr\u00edguez-\nPose and Storper 2007 for an EU-US comparative analysis). As a consequence, it seems reasonable \nthat in terms of both equity and efficiency, the geographical allocation of regional funds should \nfollow the spatial structure of these factors. Thus, regarding equity, such a distribution of resources \nacross regions should compensate the residents of \u201cdisadvantaged\u201d regions for unfavourable \nstarting conditions (Bachtler and Polverari, 2007). And in terms of efficiency, giving adequate \nattention to the structural sources of competitive disadvantage of assisted regions seems the most \neffective way of promoting the full employment of local resources.  \nAltogether spatial concentration and correlation with the factors of disadvantage are necessary \u2013 \nthough not sufficient - conditions for \u201censuring that the impact of Structural Funds is not dissipated \nthrough resources being spread too thinly (\u2026) geographically (\u2026), while at the same time making \nsure that all regions with serious structural problems receive assistance\u201d (CEC 2004, p. 164). \n \n3.0 Where do the funds actually go? Assessing their territorial concentration and the \ncoherence of their geographical allocation.  \n 13  \nIn the previous section we discussed the importance of the territorial concentration and \ngeographical distribution of the funds in relation to the structural disadvantage of the EU regions for \nthe success of any EU policy aimed at promoting regional convergence. This section sets out to \noutline an empirical strategy to investigate the spatial structure of the allocation of the EU structural \nfunds and their relationship with the sources of structural disadvantage discussed in the previous \nsection. The descriptive spatial analysis of both phenomena will be followed by an empirical \nanalytic model that singles out the importance (statistical significance) of the socio-economic \nfactors in driving the distribution of the EU structural funds (Objective 1 and 2)  under both the \n1994-1999 and 2000-2006 programming periods, in order to shed some light on the coherence of \nthe policy hitherto pursued. \nIn this section the methodology followed in the analysis is briefly presented together with the \ncorresponding dataset. The empirical results are discussed in the fourth section.  \n \n3.1 A measure for socio-economic conditions: the \u201cSocio-Economic Factors\u201d variable \nThe variables that the existing literature has shown to be more relevant for describing the socio-\neconomic disadvantage of a regional space \u2013 as discussed above - are those related to three main \ndomains: educational achievements (Lundvall, 1992; Malecki, 1997), the productive employment of \nhuman resources and its demographic structure (Fagerberg et al. 1997). From the first domain, \ntertiary educational attainment (of both the population and the labour force) and participation in \nlifelong learning programmes are assumed as a measure for the accumulation of skills at the local \nlevel. In the second domain, the percentage of labour force employed in agriculture and the long-\nterm component of unemployment are included in the analysis in order to capture the amount of \nhuman resources excluded from productive employment. Long term unemployment represents the \nincidence of people whose possibilities of being productively involved in the labour market  are \npersistently hampered by inadequate skills (Gordon, 2001). Agricultural employment is frequently \n 14  \nsynonymous with \u201chidden unemployment\u201d7 and a backward structure of the local economy \n(Federico, 2006). For the third domain, the percentage of population aged between 15 and 24 is \nassumed as a proxy for the flow of new resources entering the labour force, thus \u201crenewing\u201d the \nexisting stock of knowledge and skills (European Commission 2006) (see Appendix A for a \ndetailed description of the variables). These factors are autonomously introduced into the analysis \nin order to assess their individual weight. However, in order to assess their \u201cglobal\u201d relationship \nwith the allocation of structural funds, while minimising the problems of multicollinearity8, the \nsocio-economic variables are combined by means of Principal Component (PC) Analysis (Jollifee, \n1986). Consequently, the set of variables discussed above is \u201creduced\u201d to an individual variable that \nis able to preserve as much as possible of the initial information (variability) (see Appendix B for \nthe results of the PC analysis and technicalities). Such procedure allows to handle an individual \nvariable that \u201csummarizes\u201d the multifaceted nature of the socio-economic conditions of each region. \nIn the remaining part of the paper, this variable will be referred to as the \u201cSocio-Economic Factors\u201d \nvariable. \n \n3.2 The empirical model for the allocation of funds across regions  \nThe empirical model aims at estimating a \u201chidden\u201d decision function of the European policy maker \nin the allocation of the structural funds across regions. Such a \u201cdecision function\u201d would reflect the \n\u201crationale\u201d of the policy, uncovering the coherence of the policy design with the identified sources \nof structural disadvantage. The final decision on the allocation of the funds is the result of a \ncomplex set of interactions between the Commission, the Council and the member states (also \nmembers of the Council) which may dilute the policy objectives originally set out in the strategic \npolicy guidelines. Once the specific objectives and fields of intervention of the regional policy are \ntranslated into the necessary regulatory framework (Council Regulation) and general budget \n                                                 \n7\n Where  long term unemployment tends to be persistently high and labour mobility low, less skilled workers tend to \nmove to the countryside to be employed,  with a very low marginal productivity, in (frequently family owned) small \nfarms thus allowing an easier access to primary goods. \n8\n  Which prevents their simultaneous introduction into the regression equation. \n 15  \nallocations (in their turn the result of complex multi-level bargaining process, see e.g. Bachtler and \nWishlade, 2005 for a reconstruction of the 2007-2013 negotiation round) decided, the breakdown \nby member state of the commitment appropriation are calculated, for Objective 1, on the basis of a \nformula that takes into account the overall development of the country (national prosperity), the gap \nbetween the GDP per capita of the country\u2019s eligible regions and the Community average (regional \nprosperity) and the level of unemployment. This formula yields the  \u201cper capita aid\u201d which is then \napplied to the population of the Member State\u2019s eligible regions (those with a GDP per capita, \nmeasured in purchasing power parities, below 75% of average Community GDP) thus providing the \ncommitment appropriations for each member state. Once the national amounts are defined, the \nmagnitude of each region\u2019s financial commitment is the result of the interaction between the \nCommission and the national and regional plans and priorities.  \nThese complex institutional procedures, leading to the actual allocation of the funds to the regions \noften result in a final outcome not necessarily coherent with the principle of concentration evoked \nin the general framework of the policy. As a consequence, the assessment of the territorial \nconcentration of the funds should not be limited to the designation of eligible areas but must also \ntake into account the actual financial allocations to the regions. \nCoherently, our empirical model, by regressing the per capita regional commitments of the \nstructural funds on the sources of socio-economic disadvantage identified above, will allow us to \n\u201cmeasure\u201d the role of these factors in the actual allocation of the funds. The reduced weight of these \nfactors in both the eligibility and the allocation decisions, which contradicts the principle of \nterritorial concentration, can reflect: \na) the predominant role of \u201cpower\u201d factors in the design of the policy where the present \nallocation of the funds might be the result of the political equilibrium reached in the \nbargaining process between the Commission, the Council, the national governments, the \nlocal governments and the various pressure groups (Lehman, 1994 suggests a \u201chistorical\u201d \ntendency of spatially targeted policy to be \u201cdiluted\u201d over time. See also Bachtler and \n 16  \nWishdale, 2005 and Bachtler and Mendez, 2007 for a comprehensive analysis of these \npolitical dynamics in the negotiations for the various programming periods); \nb) the willingness of the European policy-maker to privilege, in the distribution of the funds, \nthe relatively more advantaged regions on the basis of the (questionable, as we will discuss \nlater) assumption that this category of regions would show a better potential for growth and \ndevelopment. \nTwo models will be estimated in the empirical analysis. A first model analyses the allocation of \nObjective 1 and Objective 2 funds separately, while a second model considers the overall regional \ndistribution of the structural funds. Our methodology will, up to a certain extent, follow Greenbaum \nand Bondonio (2004) who assess the territorial focus of spatially targeted policies in the US \n(Federal Empowerment Zones) and in the EU (Objective 2 programmes). Greenbaum and Bondonio \ndevelop an empirical model that estimates the probability that an area may become eligible for \npolicy support as a function of that area\u2019s pre-designation characteristics. However, in accordance \nwith our previous consideration, we have developed a more comprehensive model that assesses the \nterritorial focus of the policy by simultaneously taking into account the eligibility criteria and the \namount of funds allocated to this areas. Consequently, the first part of the empirical analysis is \nbased on a two-stage Heckman selection model (Heckman, 1979; Green, 2003). The first stage \ndetermines \u201celigibility\u201d as an Objective 1 (Objective 2) area. Such a decision is based on specific \ncriteria that should improve the territorial concentration of the funds and, \u00e0 priori, select the most \ndisadvantaged areas according to each objective\u2019s \u201cmission\u201d. However, such a decision can, in fact, \nbe biased for the reasons discussed above. Consequently, the first step of the Heckman selection \nmodel aims at assessing, through a probit model, how the factors of socio-economic disadvantage in \nfact influence the probability of a region of being assisted (or not). The model is estimated \nseparately for Obj1 regions and for Obj2 regions in both the programming periods considered. \nThe estimated model is the following: \niii Zw \u03b5\u03b3 += '                                                                               (1) \n 17  \nwhere  \nwi=1 if the region i is an assisted region and wi=0 if the region is not assisted; \nand  \n)()1Pr( ' ii Zw \u03b3\u03a6==  and )(1)0Pr( ' ii Zw \u03b3\u03a6\u2212== ; \nwhere: \u03a6 (x) is the normal cumulative distribution function; iZ is a set of socio-economic \nexplanatory variables: the Socio-Economic Factors variable computed by means of Principal \nComponents Analysis, some of its individual components and a set of national dummy variables; \n\u03b3 is a vector of parameters; and i\u03b5 is the error term. \nIn a second step the level of support is regressed on its potential determinants while taking into \naccount the selection bias introduced in the sample by the \u00e0 priori selection of eligible areas.  \nConsequently, the following second-step H-C OLS model is estimated: \niii Xy \u03b5\u03b1 +=\n'\n                                                                          (2) \nWhere iy (>0) is the level of per capita commitment in region i, \u03b1 is a parameter vector, X are the \nexplanatory variables and i\u03b5 is the error term. The set of explanatory variables includes: the socio-\neconomic conditions, a set of national dummy variables (to estimate a potential \u201cnational\u201d bias in \nthe distribution of the funds) and the Inverse Mills Ratio (IMR).  The IMR is calculated from the \nfirst stage probit model and is used in the second step as an instrument for the latent variable that \ndetermines whether an area is eligible or not. In other words the IMR links the participation of the \nregions to the distributions of the funds (1st step) with the amount of funds received (2nd step). \nThe second part of the empirical analysis will focus on how socioeconomic factors drive the \nobserved level of total regional expenditure per capita (under both Objective 1 and Objective 2): the \n\u201ccomposition effect\u201d generated by interaction of Objective 1 and Objective 2 expenditure might \neven further \u201cdilute\u201d the policy targets. \nConsequently, we will estimate an OLS model regressing the commitment level per capita under \nboth Objective 1 and 2 on the socioeconomic variables and a set of national dummy variables: \n 18  \niii Xy \u03b5\u03b1 +=\n'\n                                                                              (3) \nWhere iy (that this time includes all the regions included in the sample) is the level of per capita \ncommitments in region i, \u03b1 is a parameter vector, X are the explanatory variables (socio-economic \nfactors + national dummies) and i\u03b5 is the error term. \n \n3.3 The dataset \nSince the objective of the analysis is to assess the coherence of the spatial allocation of structural \nfunds with the sources of competitive disadvantage of the EU regions it is necessary to identify the \nmost appropriate spatial scale of analysis in order to consider homogeneous and (to the extent \npossible) functionally \u201cself contained\u201d units in terms of both their capacity to receive funds (and \nexert political pressure for this purpose) and their socio-economic structure. Where funds are \nallocated to areas without any corresponding governance level and a reduced functional self-\nconsistency, a leakage effect seems to prevail (due to the functional links of the area with the rest of \nthe region) thus forcing us to assume that the entire region is a beneficiary of the funds. \nConsequently, given the constraint of data availability, but also for reasons of homogeneity and \ncoherence in terms of the relevant institutional level discussed above, the analysis is based upon \nNUTS1 regions for Germany, Belgium and the UK and NUTS2 for all other countries9 (Spain, \nFrance, Italy, the Netherlands, Greece, Austria, Portugal, Finland). This choice for the unit of \nanalysis, while coherent with the objective of focusing the attention on \u201cself-contained\u201d functional \nregions of institutional relevance, may seem in contrast with the areas actually eligible for Objective \n2 funds: designated areas are groups of contiguous cities or towns. The adoption of such a fine \ngeographical level has proven problematic for the empirical analysis of both the structure and the \n                                                 \n9  Countries without a relevant regional structure (Denmark, Ireland, Luxemburg) were necessarily excluded \nfrom the analysis. In addition,  regional data on  many variables are not available for Sweden. As far as specific regions \nare concerned, no data are available for the French D\u00e9partments d\u2019Outre-Mer (Fr9). Uusimaa  (Fi16) and Etela-Suomi \n(Fi17) were excluded from the analysis due to the lack of data on socio-economic variables.  Etela-Suomi (Fi17) and \nTrentino-Alto Adige  (IT31) were excluded from the analysis as they have no correspondent in the NUTS2003 \nclassification, thus preventing us from matching data available only in the new NUTS classification. Islands (PT2 \nA\u00e7ores, PT3 Madeira, FR9 Departments d\u2019Outre-Mer, ES7 Canarias) and Ceuta y Melilla (ES 63) were excluded from \nthe analysis as time-distance information, necessary for the computation of spatial weights (Appendix C), is not \navailable.  \n 19  \nimpact of Objective 2 policies. The development of socio-economic indicators for actual Objective \n2 designated areas would imply aggregating data from the appropriate NUTS5 level however - as \nhighlighted in almost all similar existing research on structural funds - comprehensive data for the \nEU regions are only provided by Eurostat at the NUTS2 level (and, in some cases, not even at this \nlevel). Consequently, all the \u201cmacro\u201d analyses of structural policy have been forced to rely on a \nlarger (inevitably sub-optimal and partially arbitrary) scale of analysis (see Martin and Tyler 2006, \np.204; Basl\u00e9 2006 p.226; Armstrong and Wells 2006 p. 270; CEC 2004 p.168). While, in this \nrespect, our empirical analysis shares the limitation of all other empirical exercises on this same \ntopic, this constraint does not fundamentally bias the results of the analysis. Viewing a map of \nObjective 2 areas it is immediately apparent that they cover a large part of the non-Objective 1 areas \nthus making the average per capita commitment at the NUTS 2 level, a reasonably good proxy for \nthe actual commitment at the provincial or sub-provincial level. This idea is explicitly tested and \nempirically confirmed by Greenbaum and Bondonio (2004) who analyse the correlation of \nObjective 2 funds with their intended target in both NUTS3 level regions for the entire EU and in \nNUTS5 regions for the case of Italy (for which they find appropriate data from national sources). \nThe results of the analysis are similar in the two cases but \u201cat a finer geographical level it became \nmuch more difficult to distinguish treated from untreated areas\u201d (p.331) i.e. finding a correlation \nbetween economic distress and Objective 2 eligibility. This evidence suggests that, when moving \nthe focus of the analysis from larger areas to small geographic units (without any functional \neconomic meaning) the level of correlation between funds and economic distress tends to decrease. \nAs a consequence, our analysis, by considering large institutionally relevant units of observation \nmay, at worst, overestimate the actual level of correlation. This potential upward bias of our results \nfurther reinforces the claim for increasing concentration that we will put forth in the subsequent \nanalysis. \n 20  \nThe data on the regional distribution of commitments10 for structural fund expenditure stems from \nthe European Commission website (Inforegio) and takes into account all structural funds11. In \naddition, the analysis relies upon an Annex of the EC report \u201cThe impact of structural policies on \neconomic and social cohesion 1989-99\u201d. For the sake of comparability between programming \nperiods, Objective 1 and Objective 6 data, on the one hand, and Objective 2 and Objective 5b, on \nthe other, are combined together for the 1994-1999 commitments.   \nThe Operational Programmes (OP) and Single Programming Documents (SPD) for both \nprogramming periods have been associated to the appropriate NUTS region, providing the total \ncommitted expenditure in each region. The total commitment has been divided by the average \npopulation of the region during the respective programming period in order to obtain per capita \nexpenditure. Unfortunately the analysis could not cover the first cycle of regional policy (1989-\n1993) since data on commitments provided by the European Commission (1997) do not include \nregional information for Greece, preventing any \u00e0 priori comparability with the analysis pursued \nfor the subsequent programming periods. Furthermore data on the socio-economic indicators for the \n1988-89 reference year are only available for a few regions. \nThe data source for the socio-economic conditions of the EU regions is Eurostat\u2019s REGIO databank \n(see Appendix A for a detailed description of the variables). The year 1994 is assumed as  reference \nyear for the socio-economic conditions variables in order to minimize any potential endogeneity \nbetween  higher (lower) funds and better (worse) socio-economic conditions. \n \n4.0 Empirical results \n4.1 Spatial concentration: structural funds vs. socio-economic disadvantage \n                                                 \n10\n  Only data for commitments  rather than expenditure are available. However the use of commitments data is \ncoherent with our theoretical framework, as we aim at analysing the \u00e0 priori structure of the policy rather than \nestimating the impact of actual expenditure. \n11\n  The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF), the Guidance section of \nthe European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF-Guidance) and the Financial Instrument for fisheries \nguidance (FIGS). \n 21  \nThe analysis of the spatial distribution of the variables is pursued by calculating the value of \nMoran\u2019s I (see appendix C for technicalities). Moran\u2019s I is a measure of the global spatial \nautocorrelation of the variables (Cliff and Ord, 1981). When Moran\u2019s I is significantly different \nfrom zero the variable of interest exhibits a systematic spatial pattern. A positive value of this index \nmeans that areas with a high (low) level of per capita structural expenditure tend to cluster close to \nother areas with high (low) expenditure. The same line of reasoning is valid for the factors of socio-\neconomic disadvantage, where a positive value of the index means a pattern of clustering of regions \nwith similar high\/low values. The magnitude of the indicator provides a measure of the strength of \nthe spatial pattern i.e. the extent of the clustering process of similarly high\/low values. \n[Insert Table 1 around here] \nTable 1 shows the value of Moran\u2019s I for regional expenditure under Objective 1 and 2 and for total \nstructural fund expenditure. The table shows that a clear spatial pattern is identifiable in the \ndistribution of both funds and indicators of socio-economic disadvantage. Moran\u2019s I is positive and \nsignificant in all cases, thus showing a positive spatial autocorrelation: regions with a high (low) \nlevel of expenditure (socio-economic disadvantage) tend to be clustered together. This result is in \nline with the principle of concentration of funds repeatedly claimed by the European Commission. \nHowever, if the results are examined in greater detail by considering the magnitude of the index, it \nis possible to note, as was expected, that Objective 1 tends to be more concentrated than Objective 2 \nexpenditure which seems to respond more weakly to this principle of concentration (in both the \nprogramming periods). It must be noted, though, that the overall territorial concentration of \nexpenditure has increased after the Agenda 2000 reform of the structural funds: Moran\u2019s I for \nObjective 1, Objective 2 and total expenditure has increased from one programming period to the \nother thus confirming the capacity of this reform to impact upon the final outcome of the bargaining \nprocess leading to the regional allocations of the funds. However, as we discussed in the previous \nsections, the territorial concentration of the funds should be compared with that of the socio-\neconomic sources of competitive disadvantage. This benchmark is provided, in the last line of  table \n 22  \n1, by the Moran\u2019s I for the Socio-Economic Factors variable which is calculated through the \nPrincipal Component Analysis from the whole set of socio-economic variables previously \ndiscussed.  The comparison between the magnitude of Moran\u2019s I of the \u201cSocio-Economic Factors\u201d \nand that of structural expenditure shows that socio-economic factors are more spatially concentrated \nthan structural funding. Thus, even if the territorial concentration of expenditure increased with \nsuccessive reforms of the structural funds it seems to be still insufficient when compared to the \nspatial pattern of the sources of structural disadvantage. This provides the first evidence in support \nof our hypothesis of there being a \u201cspatial mismatch\u201d between the factor of structural disadvantage \nand regional funds, encouraging further analysis of the geographical allocation of the funds, and it \nalso confirms the possibility of achieving greater spatial concentration while allowing for the \nregional allocation of the funds to be driven by the bargaining process between the Commission and \nthe national and regional governments. However, as argued in the previous section, the existence of \na clear spatial pattern in the allocation of the funds per se might not be sufficient for the policy to \ndeliver the expected benefits; closer adherence to the regional sources of structural disadvantage \nmight also be necessary.  \n \n4.2 The drivers of the regional allocation of structural funds  \nFollowing the specification presented in par. 3.2 we estimate a two-stage Heckman selection model \nfor the allocation of Objective 1 (Tab.2) and Objective 2 (Tab.3) funds, highlighting the weight of \nthe observed socio-economic factors in the \u201cimplicit\u201d decision function for the regional allocation \nof structural funds. The tables show the estimations results for the programming periods 1994-1999 \n(on the left hand side of the table) and 2000-2006 (right hand side). For each programming period \nequations (1) and (2) are estimated by regressing the funds on the \u201cSocio-Economic Factors\u201d \nvariable (column a) and on some of its individual components12 (column b).  \n                                                 \n12\n  As noted previously multicollinearity prevents the simultaneous inclusion of all these variables into the \nregression. \n 23  \nWhen looking at the results for the Probit Selection Model (lower part of the tables), which analyses \nthe probability for a region of being eligible for Objective 1 (or Objective 2 in Tab.3) support, it \nshould be borne in mind that the magnitude of the parameters estimated by the probit technique \ndoes not have a direct meaning in terms of the extent of the corresponding effect. However, the \nparameters are informative as far as their signs and significance are concerned and provide \ninformation on how the factors of socio-economic disadvantage in fact influence the probability of a \nregion of being assisted (or not) \n[Insert Table 2 around here] \nAs regards Objective 1 funds (Tab.2), the Socio-Economic Factors variable shows a negative sign \nand a high significance level in both the programming periods thus implying that favourable socio \neconomic conditions (i.e. a high value of the social factors variable) reduce, as expected, the \nprobability of being considered an eligible area (column a). This seems to confirm that the actual \neligibility criterion, based on per capita income, is a good proxy for weak socio-economic \nconditions. However, if the factors influencing the probability of becoming an eligible region are \nconsidered in greater detail (column b), we shall notice that the \u201ctraditional\u201d sources of \ndisadvantage are more \u201crewarded\u201d by this system: the \u201cpercentage of labour force concentrated in \nagriculture\u201d and \u201clong term unemployment\u201d significantly increase the chances of being under the \n75% of the EU average per capita income (thus becoming an Objective 1 region). On the contrary, \nother factors are less accurately proxied by the actual income-based eligibility criteria. The \n\u201cpercentage of the young population\u201d is not significant while \u201ctertiary education attainments\u201d \nshows a positive sign meaning that in many cases the regions selected for assistance are not those \nwith a relatively poorer human capital endowment.  \nIn the second step of the model, the amount of funds received (by eligible areas) is analysed \n(Equation 2), assessing whether (and to what extent) the amount of funds allocated to each eligible \nregions is correlated with the magnitude of the regional socio-economic disadvantage. The \nempirical results show that, while significant for the acquisition of the status of assisted region, the \n 24  \nsocio-economic factors are not significant for determining the level of the funds received by \nassisted regions (column a). In other words, the distribution of funds across the eligible areas does \nnot seem to reflect their actual differentiated socio-economic status i.e. more disadvantaged regions \ndo not receive more funds than regions with relatively more favourable conditions. When \nconsidering specific socio-economic factors (column b) we notice that only the education level \nvariable shows a high level of significance in 2000-2006: a relatively higher percentage of tertiary \neducational achievements seems to reduce the amount of funds received in favour of less well \nendowed regions. The national dummies highlight a certain degree of national bias in the allocation \nof the funds in favour of some member states (in particular Germany and Spain in 1994-1999 and \nSpain in 2000-2006), but this bias seems to disappear when the socio-economic conditions are fully \naccounted for by the Social Factors variable.  Such national bias can be considered the result of the \nsystematically higher disadvantage of the regions of these countries (which the distribution of the \nfunds is able to reflect), rather than the result of a more favourable treatment in favour of these \ncountries. \nSuch evidence supports the idea that even if the present eligibility criterion is able to pursue a \n(rough) discrimination in favour of the relatively more disadvantaged regions, the amount of funds \ntransferred to assisted regions is not correlated to the extent of their actual socio-economic \ndisadvantage. This lack of correlation undermines the principle of concentration which, is regarded \nby the European Commission as a key pre-condition for maximising the impact of structural funds \nexpenditure (CEC 2004). \n[Insert Table 3 around here] \nTable 3 presents, in the same way as in the previous table, the results for the estimation of the two-\nstep Heckman selection model for Objective 2 funds.  The results for the probit selection model \n(column a) show, as expected, that Objective 2 regions have relatively more favourable socio-\neconomic conditions: the socio-economic factors variable is positive and significant. In addition, as \n 25  \nexpected, Objective 2 regions are mainly  industrial regions13 (a high % agriculture labour force \ntends to reduce the probability of being \u201cselected\u201d), suggesting that Objective 2 actions are still very \nmuch focused on industrial areas even after the merger with the former rural-area-oriented \nObjective 5b (column b). Furthermore the population of selected Objective 2 regions is relatively \nolder in comparison with other areas (a high percentage of young people reduces the probability of \neligibility) in accordance with the aim of providing support to less dynamic areas where ageing is a \nsignificant source of disadvantage. However, the present eligibility criteria seem unable to fully \ndiscriminate the areas with a relative scarcity of skilled labour, as shown by the non-significance of \nthe education variable in 2000-2006 and, in particular, those where the long-term component of \nunemployment is higher (negative and significant signs in both programming periods). When we \nmove on to the analysis of the determinants of the amount of funds allocated to the regions \n(Equation 2), we find no sign of any correlation with the underling socio-economic conditions of \nthe assisted areas (except for the education variable in 2000-2006). This evidence supports the idea \nof an overall weakening of the coherence between the structural funds and their ideal targets \noperated by means of the expenditure under the Objective 2. On the contrary, where aiming at \nfavouring the socio-economic \u201crestructuring\u201d of declining regions, Objective 2 funds should follow \nthe geography of socio-economic disadvantage. If the existing eligibility criteria \u2013 being explicitly \nbased upon a set of structural indicators \u2013have been able to target the funds coherently with at least \nsome of the sources of socio-economic disadvantage, the subsequent distribution of the funds to the \neligible regions seems to be markedly in contrast with the principle of concentration. The \nbargaining process for the allocation of the funds seems again able to significantly dilute the policy \nobjectives (in line with the conclusions of Greenbaum and Bondonio 2004 for Objective 2). \n[Insert Table 4 around here] \nIn table 4 the overall allocation of structural funds under both Objective 1 and 2 is assessed, thus \nfocusing upon their interactions and \u201ccomposition effect\u201d as parts of a single EU policy action.   \n                                                 \n13\n For 1994-1999  Objective 5b funds, targeted towards rural areas, are combined with the Objective 2 funds, targeted \ntowards \u201curban and industrial\u201d areas, for sake of comparability with the 2000-2006 programming period when the two \nareas are put together under Objective 2. \n 26  \nThe results for the regression of the level of total (Obj.1 + Obj.2) structural funds per capita on the \nsocio-economic conditions (Equation 3) are presented. The overall amount of funds allocated to the \nEU regions partially reflects their underlying socio-economic conditions (column a), even if the \npercentage of the overall variability explained by such factors is relatively small. This suggests that, \nwhen the distribution of Objective 1 and Objective 2 funds is assessed jointly and in a systematic \nway, the focus of the financial resources on structural factors of disadvantage tends to be rather low. \nHowever, it is worth noticing that the R-squared shows an increase from 1994-1999 to 2000-2006 \nthus confirming that Agenda 2000 succeeded in increasing the level of territorial concentration and \nthe overall correlation between the amount of funds and the magnitude of regional structural \ndisadvantage. In this dynamic perspective, the EU regional policy seems potentially able to escape \nthe \u201cspatially targeted policy trap\u201d, as warned by Lehman (1994) and highlighted by Greenbaum \nand Bondonio (2004) for the case of Objective 2 funds i.e. the tendency towards losing focus and \ndiluting the territorial concentration of the funds over time. While the territorial concentration of the \nfunds still seems sub-optimal, this trend towards increasing concentration over time in response to \nthe emphasis placed by the European Commission on this objective suggest that the claim for an \nincrease in territorial concentration is a realistic achievement.  When considering the specific socio-\neconomic factors that influence the distribution of the funds (column b), we notice that the \nagricultural labour force, as a \u201ctraditional\u201d source of disadvantage, still seems to be the main driver \nof the funds at the expense, for example, of the level of human capital accumulation which, instead, \nhas been shown to be particularly relevant in the context of a knowledge based economy. The \nnational dummies, while minimising the problem of spatial autocorrelation, highlight a certain \ndegree of national bias in the distribution of the funds in favour of the \u201ccohesion countries.\u201d A bias \nfor which, in the 1994-1999 period, Germany also received particular benefit.   \nOverall this analysis of the \u201chidden\u201d determinants of the allocation of the structural funds confirms \na weak association between the funds and the structural disadvantage of the EU territories. While \nthe reinforcement of the principle of territorial concentration has not only increased the spatial \n 27  \nconcentration of the funds but also improved their adherence to these factors of disadvantage, the \nanalysis highlights that there is still much more room for further improvement in both respects. In \naddition, while the general socio-economic structure of each regions should be taken into account \nby the allocation mechanism of the funds, some specific factors deserve greater attention in the \ncontext of the knowledge based economy. This is especially true for human capital accumulation, \nwhose deficiency has been shown insignificant to determine the amount of resources received by \nthe regions but which has become a key source of competitive advantage for both the development \nof Objective 1 and the restructuring of Objective 2 regions. \n \n4.3 Socio-economic disadvantage and regional convergence \nIn the previous section it was argued that a potential explanation for the lack of correlation observed \nbetween the factors of socio-economic disadvantage and the amount of funds received by the EU \nregions  might be explained in terms of the desire to privilege, in the distribution of funds, the \nrelatively better endowed regions. This choice could find its theoretical justification in the emphasis \non the receptiveness of the local economy as a prerequisite for successful regional policies. This \nstandpoint, developed in the framework of the neo-Schumpeterian literature, regards relatively more \nfavourable socio-economic conditions as necessary for the investment to deliver (Cappellen et. \n2003) and, consequently, the policymaker may find it more cost-effective to channel funds towards \nrelatively better-off regions (those supposed to show the better development potential) in order to \nmaximise their impact. However, the empirical evidence on the economic performance of the \nObjective 1 regions over the 1994-2003 period (i.e. from the first year of implementation of the \n1994-1999  programming to the most recent year for which regional GDP data are currently \navailable) explicitly contradicts this assumption. When sigma-convergence is considered, by \nassessing the change in the total variance of the regional income per capita from 1994 to 2003, the \nlack of convergence for both the whole Europe and the subset of Objective 1 regions is apparent \n(Table 5).  \n 28  \n[Insert Table 5 around here] \nHowever, the comparison between the T1 statistic14 (i.e. the initial year variance\/final year variance \nratios) for all the EU regions and that for the Objective 1 only shows that dispersion of regional per \ncapita income increased more significantly in the EU as a whole than in the Objective 1 regions, \nthus supporting the idea of there being a variety of \u201cclubs\u201d developing at different rates.  The lack \nof a trend towards generalised (unconditional) convergence in the EU regions is confirmed by the \nsimple beta-convergence analysis \u00e0 la Barro-Sala-i-Martin (1992) presented in table 6.  \n[Insert Table 6 around here] \nThe regression shows a negative coefficient for the log of the initial level of the GDP per capita \n(Eq.1). However the evidence of unconditional convergence becomes much weaker and almost \ninsignificant when a set of national dummies is introduced into the analysis (Eq.2) thus both \ncontrolling for the \u201cnational growth\u201d effect and minimising the extent of spatial autocorrelation. \nThe picture changes when the sub-sample of Objective 1 regions is considered separately: the \ndegree of convergence is not only stronger (Eq.3) but it also remains significant after the \nintroduction of the national dummy variables (Eq.4). This confirms the idea of a process of \u201cclub \nconvergence\u201d (Quah, 1996) among the Objective 1 regions which explicitly contradicts the idea of a \nbetter growth potential of the relatively more well-off regions (in line with Rodr\u00edguez-Pose and \nFratesi 2004). On the contrary, the initially more disadvantaged Objective 1 regions seem to grow \nfaster than other potentially better endowed areas in line with the evidence provided by Martin and \nTyler (2006) on the capacity of structural funds to at least prevent a further widening of existing \ngaps . The catching up of the former with the latter uncovers the growth potential of the poorest \nObjective 1 regions, a potential that would have been more effectively emphasized by a higher \ndegree of concentration of the structural funds thus allowing the maximisation of those externalities \nthat Bradley (2006) has shown to be necessary if any long term impact is to be achieved. In \n                                                 \n14\n The T1 statistics is : T1 = 2\n2\n1\n\u02c6\n\u02c6\nT\u03c3\n\u03c3\n. Where 21\u03c3\u02c6  is the variance of regional income per capita at time 1; \n2\n\u02c6T\u03c3  is the \nvariance at time t. This statistic is distributed as a F with (n-1; n-1)  degrees of freedom (Lichtenberg,  1994).  \n \n 29  \naddition, as shown above, such reduced concentration has been coupled with a lack of correlation \nbetween the funds and the factors of structural disadvantage. The growth potential of more \ndisadvantaged regions is confirmed when disadvantage is assessed in terms of socio-economic \nfactors and becomes very apparent when considering the Objective 1 subset alone (compare Fig.1 \nand Fig.2 where regional growth rates are scattered against socio-economic factors for all the EU15 \nregions and for the Objective 1 regions only).  \n[Insert Fig.1 and 2 around here] \nHowever, when convergence is assessed on the basis of socio-economic factors (Tab.6; equations 5-\n8), the evidence suggests that, when national effects are controlled, many socio-economically \ndisadvantaged regions are not able to catch-up with the EU as whole (Eq.7) and with the Objective \n1 \u201cclub\u201d (Eq.8). In other words, in line with the literature on the socio-economic preconditions for \nregional growth, we find that such factors have hampered the capacity of Objective 1 regions to \nconverge.  Consequently, while there is no evidence to encourage the targeting of resources towards \nrelatively better endowed regions (the contrary is in fact true), there is plenty of evidence to support \nthe necessity for the EU regional funds to tackle structural disadvantage. In consequence, the \ngeographical correlation between such disadvantage and the allocation of the funds is confirmed to \nbe a necessary condition for their effectiveness.  \n \n5.0  Some policy implications: how socio-economic factors could complement GDP per capita \nfor a more effective allocation of the funds. \nAs extensively discussed in the previous sections the present allocation mechanism relies heavily on \nGDP per capita (at Purchasing Power Standard, PPS) to drive the allocation of  regional funds: GDP \nper capita is not only the key determinant of the breakdown by member state of the commitment \nappropriation15 but it is also used to grant eligibility to Objective 1 regions. However, where the \n                                                 \n15\n It should be born in mind that, as discussed in details in section 3.2 the allocation of the funds at the country level are \ncalculated on the basis of a funding formula, while the actual commitments at the regional level are based on the \nOperational Programmes which are the result of a bargaing process between the Commission, the national and the \nregional governments. \n 30  \nactual correlation between GDP per capita (at PPS) and the structural funds per capita allocated to \nthe regions is assessed - as in table 7 \u2013 it becomes immediately apparent that the final outcome of \nthe process of allocation of the resources to the regions is only a weak reflection of the underlying \nGDP conditions. Table 7 shows that the correlation between GDP per capita (at PPS) at the \nbeginning of the programming period and total funds per capita (Obj1 + Obj2), though statistically \nsignificant, is far from perfect:  the correlation coefficient is -0.65 for 1994-1999 and -0.59 for the \n2000-2006 programming period. Furthermore this correlation sharply decreases when the sub-\nsample of Objective 1 regions is considered separately, the correlation between Objective 1 funds \nper capita and GDP per capita (at PPS) falls to -0.46 for 1994-1999 and -0.28 for 2000-2006 \nprogramming period. \n[Insert Table 7 around here] \n \nOn the basis of this evidence it might be tempting to suggest improving territorial concentration and  \nresource targeting by reinforcing this relationship between low GDP per capita (at PPS) and the \namount of funds available, thus relying even more on this simple and readily available indicator. \nHowever, while our convergence analysis highlighted - in line with a significant body of literature - \nthat socio-economic disadvantage should be the target of EU regional policy in order to promote \nconvergence, the regression analysis of the regional allocation of the funds revealed that the present \nGDP-based allocation mechanism is ineffective in channelling funds towards structural socio-\neconomic disadvantage, suggesting that a low level of GDP per capita per se would be a misleading \ndriver for regional funds (lower level of GDP does not necessarily mean lack of convergence \ncapabilities). In addition, table 7 also shows that the correlation between GDP per capita (PPS) and \nour measure of Socio-Economic disadvantage is rather low (slightly above 0.4): GDP per capita \nwould also be a poor proxy for the underlying socio-economic disadvantage. This is confirmed \nwhen looking at Fig.3, where Objective 1 regions\u2019 GDP per capita is scattered against the Socio-\nEconomic factors variables. \n 31  \n[Insert Fig.3 around here] \n The scatter clearly shows that despite similar per capita GDP (at PPS) values there are extremely \ndifferentiated regional socio-economic conditions. Figure 3 is also helpful for the detection of the \nimbalances allowed by the current allocation mechanism, which becomes immediately apparent \nwhen regions are differentiated on the basis of their structural disadvantage. The graph combines \ninformation on GDP per capita (at PPS) (x-axis), Socio-Economic environment (y-axis) and the \ncorresponding 2000-2006 Objective 1 funds per capita (the area of the symbols in the graph is \nproportional to the funds per capita allocated to each region) in Objective 1 regions. It provides us \nwith visual confirmation of the lack of a systematic relationship between the support\u2019s magnitude \nand both GDP per capita and endogenous socio-economic conditions thus allowing us to identify \nthe inconsistencies produced by the present allocation mechanism. Some regions show a similar \nlevel of GDP per capita and benefit from a comparable level of support, however, when their socio-\neconomic environment is more carefully assessed (i.e. by means of our Socio-Economic factors \nindicator), marked differences become apparent. This is \u2013 for example - the case of the regions \nCampania (Italy) and Th\u00fcringen (Thuringia, Germany). In figure 3 both regions are close to each \nother on the x-axis (i.e. they have a similar GDP per capita in PPS) and are represented on the graph \nby a symbol of a similar size (i.e. in the 2000-2006 programming period benefited from a similar \namount of resources per capita). However, their different y-coordinates (i.e. the value of the Socio-\nEconomic factors variable) uncover intrinsic structural differences in terms of their capacity to \nconverge: while Campania shows critical socio-economic conditions, Th\u00fcringen shows a relatively \nmore favorable situation thus probably needing comparatively fewer resources to tackle its \neconomic backwardness. Symmetrically, figure 3 allows the detection of regions benefiting from a \nsignificantly different level of support per capita while showing similarly unfavorable socio-\neconomic conditions, as in the case, for example, of Alentejo (Spain) and Kriti (Crete, Greece). \nEven though these regions show a similar value in terms of their Socio-Economic factors variable \n(y-axis) a significantly higher amount of resources was committed to Alentejo .   \n 32  \n \nThe observed allocation of the EU funds is, as extensively discussed in this paper, the result of a \ncomplex bargaining process between the Commission, the member states and the regions in which  \npower equilibriums and the differentiated capability of each region to \u201cattract\u201d (and lobby for) \nadditional resources play a significant role. While this mechanism is to be preserved, as it provides \nan incentive for the capability of the regions to design and plan the policy measures to be actually \nimplemented, the present analysis calls for a corrective mechanism able to increase territorial \nconcentration and channel more  resources towards relatively more socio-economically \ndisadvantaged regions. Precisely the most disadvantaged (and institutionally weak) regions might \nbe less able to effectively compete for the EU funds. The analysis pursued in this section has also \nhighlighted the unsuitability of GDP per capita - where regional policy is seen as a tool to promote \nconvergence - as a \u201cdriver\u201d for an effective allocation of the EU regional funds. In the light of all \nthis, how might the current mechanism be improved in order to achieve an allocation of the funds \nwhich is more in line with the regional sources of structural disadvantage? Of course, any change in \nthe present allocation mechanism has to be balanced against the significant difficulties arising when \nany reform is to be negotiated among 27 Member States. However, our results suggest that \u2013 even \nwhile preserving the actual institutional procedure for the allocation of the funds and keeping \nlargely unaffected the current allocation mechanism - significantly better targeting of the available \nresources could be achieved by combining GDP per capita with further information on the socio-\neconomic conditions of the target areas. As shown in the empirical analysis, \u201875% of the EU\u2019s \naverage per capita income (at PPS)\u2019 threshold for Objective 1 eligibility has guaranteed a certain \ndegree of territorial concentration of the funds. However, the eligibility criteria based upon the level \nof GDP per capita provides only a rough assessment of the highly differentiated development \ncapabilities of the local economies. Consequently, once eligibility is granted on the basis of this \nrule, areas (and the associated funds) should be further differentiated on the basis of a wider set of \nsocio-economic indicators by \u201creserving\u201d to the most socio-economically disadvantaged regions a \n 33  \nlarger share of the available \u201cconvergence\u201d (Objective 1 in the \u201cold\u201d terminology) resources.  By \ndifferentiating the available resources into various \u201csegments\u201d made available to the regions \naccording to their degree of structural disadvantage, the \u201cfit\u201d between the spatial distribution of the \nfund and the sources of socio-economic disadvantage would be improved. \nThis mechanism would help reduce the endogeneity of the actual allocation mechanism, which \ninevitably tends to favour actors with a better institutional endowment but, at the same time, it \nwould maintain the final level of financing related to the planning capabilities of each region.  The \nfinal commitments would still depend upon the plans presented by the assisted areas even though \nthe pool of resources made available to the regions would vary according to their socio-economic \nconditions. \nAn example of the subdivision of total available resources into different \u201cpools\u201d made available to \ndifferent \u201ccategories\u201d of areas \u2013 though still \u201ccategorised\u201d on the basis of their GDP per capita \u2013 has \nbeen already introduced in the 2007-2013 General Regulation for the structural funds16.  A specific \namount of the resources devoted to the Convergence Objective, remains earmarked to the 16 \nregions whose GDP per capita is 75% below the EU 15 average but greater than 75% of the per \ncapita income of the EU 25 average (i.e. the regions loosing their eligibility due to the \u201cstatistical \neffect\u201d). This subdivision in the allocation of the convergence funds aims at reducing the resources \ndevoted to these regions considered, on the basis of their GDP, more advantaged than other \nconvergence regions. However, in this case, the application of the GDP criteria has granted \n\u201cautomatic\u201d eligibility to a very heterogeneous set of regions, thus allowing funds to flow towards \nrelatively more advantaged areas at the expense of others where, although the GDP per capita is \nabove 75% of the EU average, the socioeconomic conditions are more critical than in some of the \nother 86 convergence regions. The same is true for the complex of the 86 convergence regions, \nwhich includes, without any differentiation almost the entire territory of the new member states, \n                                                 \n16\n COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 1083\/2006 of 11 July 2006 laying down general provisions on the European \nRegional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund and repealing Regulation (EC) No \n1260\/1999 \n \n 34  \nalthough a vast amount of literature has highlighted an astonishing variety in the socio-economic \nsituations within these countries. Conversely, the application of a wider set of socio-economic \nindicators to further differentiate among these convergence regions, would have allowed for a finer \n\u00e0 priori targeting of the resources. \nThe mechanism designed for the 2007-2013 programming period suggests that an agreement among \nthe member states on \u201cgradual\u201d changes of the allocation mechanism is actually feasible. Our \nresults suggest that a significant improvement in the present allocation mechanism would be \nachieved by  integrating GDP with additional indicators able to take into account the differences \nthat the literature and the convergence analysis have shown to be crucial for regional convergence \ncapability, and which remain outside the scope of GDP per capita (PPS). \n \n6.0 Conclusions \nThis paper sets out to investigate the coherence of the allocation of the structural fund to the regions \nwith the principle of territorial concentration. While some contributions have suggested that the \nnature of the policies implemented within the EU regional policy framework might have curbed the \nimpact of the structural expenditure at the level of territorial cohesion, this paper suggests that \npotential inconsistencies in the policy as regards the objective of territorial cohesion might have \narisen at a more upstream phase i.e. in the allocation mechanism of the funds to the regions. This \nmechanism might not only have led to an insufficient territorial concentration of the expenditure but \nalso to an insufficient correlation between the funds and the set of socio-economic conditions that \nshown to be responsible for hampering the economic success of many EU regions.  \nOur empirical analysis investigated both these issues in order to test this possibility which, where \nviolating the principle of territorial concentration, might have prevented the structural funds from \nmaximising their cost-effectiveness in terms of territorial cohesion. The results reveal that the \nregional distribution of the structural funds shows a degree of spatial concentration in compliance \nwith the principle of concentration. However, while the theoretical discussion supported the idea \n 35  \nthat the EU funds should be allocated in order to \u201ccompensate\u201d for the structural disadvantage of \nthe assisted areas (thus maximising their effectiveness), empirical results suggest that the \ndisadvantage is more spatially concentrated than the associated funds: in this perspective the present \nlevel of concentration of the funds can be judged insufficient. Furthermore, the empirical model \nuncovered a weak association between the amounts of regional funds and the above-mentioned \nsources of competitive disadvantage, especially as far as the problem of human capital \naccumulation is concerned.  \nSuch an inconsistent spatial allocation of the EU funds is likely to have reduced their capability to \nimpact upon the regional growth performance of assisted regions and has inevitably produced a bias \nin the allocation of national resources as well, due to the co-financing mechanism17, which forced \nthe national co-financing of community funds. \nThe policy analysis suggests that such a geographical allocation of funds may be either the result of \nthe political dilution of the policy objectives (required by EU political equilibriums) or the effect of \nan intentional focus on relatively better endowed regions. However, the empirical evidence casts \ndoubt on the rationale of such a bias in favour of the areas believed to represent a more  favourable \ncondition of receptiveness for the funds.  \nConsequently, every effort should be produced not only to promote the spatial concentration of the \nexpenditure (which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for increased effectiveness) but also \nto increase its capability to target the factors of socio-economic disadvantage. Furthermore, while \nnot undermining the robustness of the analysis discussed so far, it is necessary to bear in mind that \nthe analysis is based on Structural Funds data on financial commitments rather than on actual \nspending (the latter are not available until well after the programme periods have ended). As a \nconsequence, actual expenditure, given the differentiated spending capacity of the various regions, \nmight further accentuate the bias in the geographical distribution of the funds given that the more \n                                                 \n17\n  \u201cEach euro spent at the EU level by cohesion policy leads to further expenditure, averaging 0.9 euros, in less \ndeveloped regions (current Objective 1) and 3 euros in regions undergoing restructuring (current Objective 2)\u201d \nCOMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION, Brussels, 05.07.2005 COM(2005) 0299, \u201cCohesion Policy in \nSupport of Growth and Jobs: Community Strategic Guidelines, 2007-2013\u201d, p.7. \n 36  \nsocio-economically disadvantaged regions are also more likely to record a relatively worse \nperformance in terms of their capacity to translate commitments into actual expenditure.  \nThe analysis has allowed the identification of simple improvements in the mechanism of allocation \nof the funds to the regions which, if implemented, would significantly increase territorial \nconcentration and help channel more resources towards the most socio-economically disadvantaged \nareas.  In the 2007-2013 programming period the \u201cConvergence Objective\u201d funds have been sub-\ndivided into two different \u201cpools\u201d, in order to further differentiate the resources devoted to eligible \nareas on the basis of their GDP per capita conditions. Our analysis suggested that the introduction \nof a similar differentiation of the resources available made to the eligible regions - where based \ninstead on a proxy for socio-economic structural disadvantage \u2013 would provide an allocation of the \nfunds more in line with the EU\u2019s regional policy objectives. It must be acknowledged that these \ncritical issues (and geographical concentration in particular) have been explicitly considered by the \nEuropean Commission when assessing the weaknesses of the past programming periods. However, \nwhen the Commission\u2019s analysis has to be balanced against not only the claims of individual \ncountries in terms of budget equilibriums but also inaccurate diagnoses on where investment is \nmore worthwhile, implementing concrete corrective measures turns out to be a very gradual \nprocess.  \n \nIn conclusion, the discussion of the implication of the potential benefits of a more effective \noperationalisation of the principle of territorial concentration should not hide the crucial importance \nof the regional policy implemented. An increase in the territorial focus of the financial resources, by \nchannelling more resources to the most disadvantaged regions does not per se necessarily imply an \nincrease in their capability to converge (as the standard neo-classical framework would suggest). An \nincrease in the Structural funds\u2019 focus on more socio-economic disadvantaged areas needs to be \nmatched by appropriate actions for the reinforcement of their local governance and translated into \n 37  \ntailor-made local policies able to tackle the sources of structural disadvantage of each individual \nregion in particular with respect to the challenges posed by the  knowledge-based economy. \n \nAcknowledgements  \nThe author would like to thank Harvey Armstrong, Roberta Capello, Fabrizio De Filippis, Andr\u00e9s \nRodr\u00edguez-Pose, Carlo Pietrobelli and the participants at the seminars in Pisa, Rome and Volos for \ntheir comments to earlier drafts of this paper.

Through the PCA the original variables (in the case of our analysis the \nvariables shown in literature as representative of the socio-economic disadvantage of the EU \nregions) are linearly combined by means of a set of \u201cweights\u201d (a1, a2, \u2026, ak)  calculated in order to \nmaximise (under the constraint of that the sum of the squared weights is equal to one) the variability \nof the resulting indicator, i.e of the principal component (our Social Factors variable). \nConsequently the i-th principal component is: \nyi=ai1x1+ ai2x2+\u2026+aipxp \nwhere (ai1,ai2 aip) are the wights and   x1, x2, \u2026 ,xk are the k variables. \nIt is possible to calculate as many PCs as the original variables under the constraint of non-\ncorrelation with the previous ones. Anyway the PCs are able to account for a progressively \ndecreasing amount of the total variance of the original variables. Consequently, the procedure allow \nus to concentrate our attention on the first and limited number of PCs, which are the most \nrepresentative of the phenomenon under analysis. \nTable B-1 shows the Eigenanalysis of the Correlation Matrix. The first PC alone accounts for \naround 43% of the total variance with an Eigenvalue significantly larger than 1, the second PC \naccounts for an additional 22% of the total variability with an Eigenvalue still larger than 1. The \nfirst two principal components therefore explain a significant part of total variability (65%).  \nTab.

A negative weight is, as expected, assigned to the agricultural labour force (-\n0.446) and, with a smaller coefficient, long-term unemployment (-0.139). The weight of the young \npopulation (0.006) is much smaller but positive. This first principal component provides us with the \n\u201cjoint measure\u201d for each region\u2019s socio-economic conditions. Consequently, the first principal \n 43  \ncomponent\u2019s scores are computed from the standardised18 value of the original variables by using \nthe coefficients listed under PC1 in table B-2.  \n \nTab.
