The major com-\nponents of the nuclear lamina are type V intermediate fi lament \nproteins referred to as lamins (Hutchison, 2002; Shumaker \net al., 2003) and various lamin-binding proteins (Burke and \nStewart, 2002). In mammals, at least one of the B-type lamins, \nencoded by LMNB1 and LMNB2, is constitutively expressed \nand essential for cell viability. The A-type lamins A and C, en-\ncoded by LMNA, are expressed in most terminally differentiated \nsomatic cells but are absent in early embryos and some undif-\nferentiated cells. Interestingly, lamins A and C are also found in \nthe nucleoplasm as discrete foci, fi lamentous structures, or are \nuniformly distributed throughout the nucleus (Dechat et al., \n2000) and have been implicated in chromatin organization \n(Gruenbaum et al., 2005), DNA replication (Moir et al., 2000), \nRNA Pol II\u2013dependent transcription (Spann et al., 2002), and \ncontrol of gene expression (Gruenbaum et al., 2005).\nAside from lamins, numerous lamin-binding proteins are \nalso considered to be important components of the nuclear lam-\nina and of nucleoplasmic lamin structures (Foisner, 2001; Burke \nand Stewart, 2002). Among the best-studied lamin-binding \n proteins are the LAP2 family members. Of the six alternatively \nspliced LAP2 isoforms, four\u2014LAP2\u03b2, -\u03b3, -\u03b4, and -\u03b5\u2014are \ntype II membrane proteins in the inner nuclear membrane (Harris \net al., 1994; Berger et al., 1996) and bind lamin B (Foisner and \nGerace, 1993; Furukawa et al., 1998). LAP2\u03b1 is structurally \nand functionally different. It shares only the NH2 terminus with \nthe other isoforms and contains a unique COOH terminus. \nLAP2\u03b1 is localized throughout the nucleus (Dechat et al., 1998; \nVlcek et al., 1999) and has been identifi ed as a specifi c binding \npartner of nucleoplasmic A-type lamins (Dechat et al., 2000).\nAll LAP2 isoforms as well as the inner nuclear membrane \nproteins emerin and MAN1 share a common structural motif \ncalled the LAP2\u2013emerin\u2013MAN1 (LEM) domain (Lin et al., \n2000), which mediates binding to BAF (barrier to autointegra-\ntion factor), an essential, highly conserved DNA-binding  protein \nLamina-associated polypeptide 2\u03b1 regulates \ncell cycle progression and differentiation \nvia the retinoblastoma\u2013E2F pathway\nDaniela Dorner,1 Sylvia Vlcek,1 Nicole Foeger,1 Andreas Gajewski,1 Christian Makolm,1 Josef Gotzmann,1 \nChristopher J.

In this \nstudy, we show that the overexpression of LAP2\u03b1 in \n fi broblasts reduced proliferation and delayed entry into \nthe cell cycle from a G0 arrest. In contrast, stable down-\nregulation of LAP2\u03b1 by RNA interference accelerated \nproliferation and interfered with cell cycle exit upon \n serum starvation. The LAP2\u03b1-linked cell cycle pheno-\ntype is mediated by the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein \n because the LAP2\u03b1 COOH terminus directly bound Rb, \nand overexpressed LAP2\u03b1 inhibited E2F\/Rb-dependent \n reporter gene activity in G1 phase in an Rb-dependent \nmanner.

Based on these \ninteractions, LEM domain proteins in the nuclear lamina and \nthe nuclear interior have been implicated in chromatin organiza-\ntion (Dechat et al., 2004; Segura-Totten and Wilson, 2004).\nMutations in the LMNA gene have been shown to cause \na variety of inherited human diseases (laminopathies) that affect \ndifferent tissues, including skeletal muscle, heart, adipose \n tissue, peripheral nerves, and skin, or cause premature aging \n(Burke and Stewart, 2002; Hutchison and Worman, 2004; \nMounkes and Stewart, 2004). The molecular basis of these \n diseases is still unclear. Besides structural defects in lamin com-\nplexes, it has also been suggested that disease-causing  mutations \nin LMNA may interfere with the proposed gene regulatory func-\ntions of lamins (Hutchison and Worman, 2004). Among several \nreported interactions of lamina proteins with transcriptional \n activators or repressors (Gruenbaum et al., 2005), the interaction \nof A-type lamins (Ozaki et al., 1994) and of nucleoplasmic \n lamin A\/C\u2013LAP2\u03b1 complexes (Markiewicz et al., 2002) with \nthe retinoblastoma (Rb) protein may also regulate gene expres-\nsion via infl uencing Rb activity. Rb regulates progression \nthrough the cell cycle at the G1\u2192S-phase transition by inhibiting \nthe activity of E2F-type transcription factors in a phosphory-\nlation-dependent manner and by mediating epigenetic changes \non the promoter region of E2F\/Rb target genes (Frolov and Dyson, \n2004). It has been shown that Rb is required for the terminal \ndifferentiation of many tissues, including adipose and muscle \ntissue (Hansen et al., 2004; Huh et al., 2004), which are also af-\nfected in laminopathies. Based on these data, an intriguing lam-\ninopathy disease model has recently been raised, arguing that \nlamin A\/C complexes may cooperate with Rb in controlling cell \ncycle progression and differentiation of mesenchymal stem \ncells during tissue regeneration and turnover.

Intriguingly, mutations in the gene encoding the nucleo-\nplasmic lamin A\/C\u2013interacting protein LAP2\u03b1 has recently \nbeen linked to dilated cardiomyopathy in humans, clinically \n resembling lamin A\u2013linked disease phenotypes (Taylor et al., \n2005). As LAP2\u03b1 is only expressed at very low levels in differ-\nentiated muscle, it is hard to imagine how mutations in LAP2\u03b1 \ncan lead to the disease phenotype in fully differentiated heart \nmuscle cells. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that LAP2\u03b1, \nwhich has previously been shown to mediate the nuclear reten-\ntion of Rb (Markiewicz et al., 2002), may also be involved in \nRb-mediated control of cell cycle progression and differentia-\ntion in muscle precursor cells. Deregulation of this function in \npatients expressing the disease variant of LAP2\u03b1 may then lead \nto impaired tissue turnover.\nIn this study, we investigate whether LAP2\u03b1 can affect \ncell cycle progression and differentiation. We found that LAP2\u03b1 \ninhibits progression from G1 to S phase and initiates early \nstages of differentiation in an in vitro adipocyte differentiation \nculture model. We further show that the cell cycle and differen-\ntiation regulatory function of LAP2\u03b1 requires Rb and involves \nregulation of the activity of E2F transcription factors.\nResults\nLAP2\ud835\udec2 expression levels affect \ncell cycle progression\nTo test the infl uence of LAP2\u03b1 expression levels on cell cycle \nprogression, we used two different cell models. First, we gener-\nated stable HeLa cell clones expressing a myc-tagged LAP2\u03b1 \nunder the control of a doxycyclin-dependent promoter, which \nallowed analysis of the cell cycle phenotypes in a single cell \nclone expressing different levels of LAP2\u03b1. Although HeLa \ncells are transformed by human papilloma virus E7 oncogene \n(Helt and Galloway, 2003), they retain a certain level of cell \n cycle control, as shown by their growth-inhibitory response to \nserum starvation (see serum starvation data in Fig. 2). LAP2\u03b1-\nmyc HeLa cells grown in the absence of doxycyclin expressed \nexclusively endogenous LAP2\u03b1, which is shown by immuno-\nfl uorescence microscopy and immunoblot analyses of total cell \nlysates. The addition of doxycyclin to the culture medium in-\nduced the expression of myc-tagged LAP2\u03b1 in the nucleoplasm \n(Fig. 1 A), giving rise to a total LAP2\u03b1 level twice as high as \nthat in uninduced cells. Cells grown in the absence of doxycy-\nclin proliferated signifi cantly faster than the cells grown perma-\nnently in doxycyclin-containing medium (18- vs. 22-h doubling \ntimes; Fig. 1 A). When doxycyclin was added to cells only upon \nseeding into culture dishes, they showed intermediate growth \nrates (\n20-h doubling time; Fig. 1 A). The addition of doxy-\ncyclin to untransfected cells had no infl uence on cell growth \n (Vlcek et al., 1999). Interestingly, the cell proliferation-inhibitory \neffect of LAP2\u03b1 was most prominent in dense cultures. DNA \nfl ow cytometry analyses in dense cultures grown in the absence \nor presence of doxycyclin (Fig. 1 C) showed a slight increase \nin the relative number of cells in G1 phase (63\u219270%) and a \n decrease in S-phase cells (24\u219219%) upon doxycyclin addition. \nIn addition, we showed previously by BrdU incorporation \n assays that transient overexpression of LAP2\u03b1 leads to a reduc-\ntion in cells in S phase (Vlcek et al., 2002). Therefore, we con-\ncluded that increased LAP2\u03b1 protein levels negatively affect \nG1\u2192S-phase transition.\nTo confi rm this result in a cell system with an intact cell \ncycle checkpoint control mechanism, we stably expressed a \nLAP2\u03b1-GFP fusion protein in mouse 3T3 fi broblasts. As shown \nby immunoblot analyses of cell lysates and by immunofl uores-\ncence microscopy, stable 3T3 cell clones expressed roughly \nequal amounts of ectopic LAP2\u03b1-GFP and endogenous LAP2\u03b1, \nboth of which localized to the nucleoplasm (Fig. 1 B). In three \nindependent clones of LAP2\u03b1-GFP\u2013expressing cells, we found \na subtle but reproducible reduction in their cell proliferation \nrate compared with that of untransfected or GFP-expressing \ncontrol cells under optimal culture conditions (10% FCS). DNA \nfl ow cytometry also revealed a slight increase in G1-phase cells \nupon LAP2\u03b1-GFP expression (not depicted), indicating an in-\nhibitory role of LAP2\u03b1 on G1\u2192S-phase progression. However, \nbecause both control cells and LAP2\u03b1-GFP\u2013expressing cells \nshowed an effi cient cell cycle arrest in dense cultures (Fig. 1 B), \nthe proliferation-inhibitory role of LAP2\u03b1 may not be detect-\nable as clearly as in dense HeLa cells, which have a compro-\nmised, although not completely inhibited, density-mediated \ngrowth control.\nFigure 2. Reduced LAP2\ud835\udec2 levels favor cell cycle progression. (A) HeLa \ncells were stably transfected with a LAP2\u03b1-specifi c shRNA vector construct \n(LAP2\u03b1 RNAi) or with a construct targeting fi refl y luciferase (ctrl). Cells \nwere analyzed by immunofl uorescence microscopy using monoclonal anti-\nLAP2\u03b1 antibody and by immunoblot analyses of total cell lysates using \nanti-LAP2 antibody (detecting both LAP2\u03b1 and LAP2\u03b2).

DNA fl ow cytometry revealed that LAP2\u03b1- \nGFP\u2013expressing cells showed a signifi cantly delayed reentry \ninto S phase (Fig. 1 C) and a persistent growth reduction within \n7 d after induction (Fig. 1 B) when compared with untransfected \nor GFP-expressing cell clones. We concluded that increased \nLAP2\u03b1 protein levels only weakly affected cell proliferation \nin growing 3T3 cells but interfered with pathways regulating \nG0\/G1 phase to S-phase transition.\nHaving shown that the overexpression of LAP2\u03b1 nega-\ntively affects proliferation and cell cycle entry, we wondered \nwhether reduced levels of LAP2\u03b1 would have opposing effects. \nAlthough stable RNAi-mediated down-regulation of LAP2\u03b1 \nwas not achieved in 3T3 fi broblasts, stable HeLa cell clones \nwith reduced levels of LAP2\u03b1 were generated successfully. \n Immunoblot analyses of total cell lysates showed that unlike an \nunrelated control RNAi construct (targeting fi refl y luciferase), \nstable transfection with a LAP2\u03b1-specifi c short hairpin RNA \n(shRNA) construct reduced endogenous LAP2\u03b1 to <10% of \nthe protein level in control cells, whereas the expression of \nLAP2\u03b2 remained unchanged (Fig. 2 A). In addition, immuno-\nfl uorescence microscopy of LAP2\u03b1 knockdown versus control \ncells revealed a signifi cant down-regulation of LAP2\u03b1 protein. \nAs expected, the proliferation rate of LAP2\u03b1 knockdown cell \nclones was increased signifi cantly compared with that of con-\ntrol cells even in optimal growth conditions (Fig. 2 B, 10% FCS). \nInterestingly, in low serum conditions (0.5% FCS), control \ncells exhibited a very low proliferation rate (45-h doubling \ntime), whereas proliferation of LAP2\u03b1 knockdown cells was \nsimilar to that in complete medium (25-h doubling time). \nDNA fl ow cytometry confi rmed that LAP2\u03b1-defi cient cells \nwere not as effi ciently arrested in G1 phase as control cells in \nlow serum medium (Fig. 2 C). Altogether, we concluded that \nLAP2\u03b1 is involved in cell cycle entry\/exit checkpoints and\/or in \nG1\u2192S-phase transition.\nLAP2\ud835\udec2 interacts with Rb in the COOH \nterminus and associates with E2F\/Rb \npromoter sequences in vivo\nNext, we wanted to gain more insights into the molecular basis \nof LAP2\u03b1\u2019s effect on the cell cycle. Our previous data revealed \nthat LAP2\u03b1 bound to hypophosphorylated Rb (Markiewicz \net al., 2002), which is the predominant Rb form in G1 phase of \nproliferating cells or in resting cells in G0 phase. Hypophos-\nphorylated Rb blocks transition into S phase by inhibiting the \nactivity of E2F transcription factors that are essential for the ex-\npression of S phase\u2013specifi c genes (Classon and Harlow, 2002). \nTherefore, we reasoned that overexpressed LAP2\u03b1 may bind \nRb and, in turn, affect its E2F-repressing activity. To analyze \nthe interaction of LAP2\u03b1 and Rb in more detail, we narrowed \ndown the Rb interaction domain in LAP2\u03b1.

Because a COOH-terminal \nLAP2\u03b1 fragment (aa 410\u2013693) and a fragment missing the last \nCOOH-terminal 78 residues (aa 1\u2013615) also bound Rb, al-\nthough less strongly than the other construct, we concluded that \nthe Rb interaction domain of LAP2\u03b1 is located in LAP2\u03b1\u2019s \nunique COOH-terminal domain between aa 415\u2013615, but resi-\ndues downstream of aa 615 may also contribute to the interac-\ntion (Fig. 3 A). Intriguingly, the Rb interaction domain is located \nnext to the previously identifi ed lamin A\/C interaction domain \n(Fig. 3 A; Dechat et al., 2000). Thus, it may well be possible \nthat LAP2\u03b1, lamin A\/C, and Rb form a trimeric complex in \ncells, as previously suggested based on coimmunoprecipitation \nof these proteins from lysates of untransformed human dermal \nfi broblasts (Markiewicz et al., 2002). To test whether this com-\nplex can also be formed in transformed HeLa cells, in which at \nleast part of Rb is bound to E6 and E7 oncoproteins, we immuno-\nprecipitated LAP2\u03b1 complexes from LAP2\u03b1-GFP\u2013expressing \nHeLa cells and analyzed samples by immunoblotting. As shown \nin Fig. 3 B, LAP2\u03b1\/LAP2\u03b1-GFP immunoprecipitates obtained \nwith a monoclonal antibody (m) or a polyclonal serum to \nLAP2\u03b1 (p) contained Rb and lamin A\/C. Control precipitations \nwith mouse IgG (Fig. 3 B, ctrl) or preimmune serum (Fig. 3 B, \nPI) did not pull down any of these proteins. Thus, LAP2\u03b1\u2013 lamin \nA\/C\u2013Rb complexes also exist in transformed HeLa cells and \ncould potentially be involved in the aforementioned cell cycle \nregulatory function of LAP2\u03b1 (Figs. 1 and 2).\nWe were unable to detect E6, E7, and E2F proteins in cell \nlysates and immunoprecipitates most likely as a result of their \nlow concentrations in the samples. Therefore, to test the associa-\ntion of LAP2\u03b1 with E2F complexes, we performed chromatin \nimmunoprecipitation with monoclonal and polyclonal LAP2\u03b1 \nantibodies and tested the association of LAP2\u03b1 with endogenous \nE2F-dependent promoters (Fig. 3 C). Intriguingly, unlike the pre-\nimmune serum (Fig. 3 C, PI), both antibodies pulled down DNA \nfragments containing E2F-dependent promoter sequences of the \nthymidine kinase (Fig. 3 C, TK) genes in HeLa and 3T3 cells. \nFurthermore, the E2F-dependent promoter sequence of cyclin \nD1 was effi ciently precipitated by monoclonal LAP2\u03b1  antibody \n(Fig. 3 C, m) in 3T3 and HeLa cells and by LAP2\u03b1  antiserum \n(Fig. 3 C, p) in HeLa cells, whereas promoter sequences of the \nE2F-independent genes histone H4 and E-cadherin were not de-\ntected in the immunoprecipitates over background level. In con-\ntrast, antibodies to acetylated histone H4 as a positive control \npulled down all DNA sequences tested. Thus LAP2\u03b1 complexes \nspecifi cally bind to E2F-dependent promoter  sequences in vivo.\nLAP2\ud835\udec2 affects E2F-dependent transcription\nTo test whether LAP2\u03b1 may affect E2F-dependent promoter \nactivity, we tested the effect of overexpressed LAP2\u03b1 in an \nE2F-dependent luciferase reporter assay. Proliferating 3T3 cul-\ntures exhibited a basal reporter activity, which was induced \nthreefold upon the transient expression of E2F-1. Coexpression \nof E2F-1 and Rb reduced reporter activity to basal levels as \n expected because Rb can sequester and inactivate free active \nE2F-1 (Fig. 4 A). Importantly, the coexpression of LAP2\u03b1 with \nE2F-1 also decreased the reporter activity as effectively as Rb, \nwhereas an NH2-terminal LAP2\u03b1 fragment (LAP2\u03b1-N) that did \nnot bind Rb (Fig. 3 A) and did not effect cell cycle progression \nFigure 4. LAP2\ud835\udec2 reduces E2F transcription activity in an Rb-dependent \nmanner.

Cells were transfected \nwith an E2F-dependent luciferase reporter and a \u03b2-galactosidase expres-\nsion construct (for normalization of transfection effi ciencies) together with \nempty vectors (\u2212) or expression vectors encoding E2F-1, Rb, LAP2\u03b1, and \nLAP2\u03b1 N terminus (LAP2\u03b1-N). Reporter activity was measured 24 h after \ntransfection.

Thus, full-length LAP2\u03b1 effi ciently \ninhibited exogenous E2F-dependent activity, which is consistent \nwith the negative effect of LAP2\u03b1 on cell proliferation and cell \ncycle reentry.\nSo far, we have shown that LAP2\u03b1 interferes with the \n activity of overexpressed ectopic E2F-1. To confi rm this result \nunder more physiological conditions, we wanted to analyze the \neffect of LAP2\u03b1 on the activity of endogenous E2F. As ex-\npected, endogenous E2F-dependent activity was low in aphidi-\ncolin-treated cells, which were arrested at the G1\u2192S-phase \ntransition (shown by DNA fl ow cytometry; Fig. 4 B). Aphidicolin-\narrested 3T3 cells also contained predominantly hypophos-\nphorylated Rb that migrates faster on SDS PAGE, whereas \nproliferating 3T3 cells revealed an Rb double band, refl ecting \nhyper- and hypophosphorylated forms. Thus, unlike trans-\nformed HEK cells (shown as a control in Fig. 4 B), aphidicolin-\ntreated 3T3 cells were effi ciently arrested at the G1\u2013S-phase \nboundary. Upon the release of cells from the block, they syn-\nchronously proceeded through S phase, and E2F-dependent ac-\ntivity was increased 2\u20136 h after the release, whereas it declined \nagain after 8\u201310 h when cells were in late S\/G2 phase (Fig. 4 B). \nWe measured the effect of overexpressed LAP2\u03b1 on endoge-\nnous activity at two different cell cycle stages: in late G1 phase \n(aphidicolin arrested), when E2F-dependent activity is low \n because of the expression of hypophosphorylated Rb, and in \nS phase (4 h after release), when E2F-dependent activity is high. \nIn G1 phase, a low basal E2F-dependent activity was further \n reduced (twofold) upon the expression of exogenous Rb or of \nLAP2\u03b1 (Fig. 4 C). In contrast, in S-phase cells with a higher \nbasal E2F-dependent activity, LAP2\u03b1 expression was unable to \nrepress E2F-dependent activity, whereas overexpressed Rb still \nreduced it up to twofold (Fig. 4 C). These results imply that \nLAP2\u03b1 can repress E2F-dependent activity through hypophos-\nphorylated Rb in G1 phase, which is consistent with our previ-\nous data that LAP2\u03b1 binds preferentially to the G1 phase\u2013specifi c \nhypophosphorylated Rb (Markiewicz et al., 2002). Overall, our \nstudies strongly support a role of LAP2\u03b1 in regulating E2F-\n dependent activity in an Rb-dependent manner.\nHaving shown that LAP2\u03b1 binds to promoter sequences \nof endogenous E2F target genes, we wondered whether over-\nexpressed LAP2\u03b1 also affects the expression of these genes. \nAs E2F target genes are differentially expressed during the cell \ncycle, we arrested 3T3 control cells and LAP2\u03b1-GFP\u2013 expressing \n3T3 cells in G0 phase by serum starvation. After reentry into the \ncell cycle by serum addition, we analyzed mRNA levels of three \nknown E2F target genes (cyclin D1, thymidine kinase, and \n cyclin E) and of one E2F-independent control gene (actin) by \nsemiquantitative RT-PCR. As expected, unlike actin mRNA, the \nmRNA levels of all three E2F target genes in control 3T3 cells \nincreased between 10 and 14 h after serum addition (Fig. 5), \nwhen cells  proceeded to the G1\u2013S-phase boundary (for DNA \nfl ow  cytometry, see Fig. 1 C). In LAP2\u03b1-GFP\u2013expressing 3T3 \ncells, the increase in E2F target gene mRNAs was delayed by \n\n5 h compared with the control (Fig. 5). These fi ndings are \n consistent with an inhibitory function of LAP2\u03b1 repressing en-\ndogenous E2F target gene expression.\nLAP2\ud835\udec2 function in cell cycle progression \ndepends on Rb\nOur fi ndings could be explained if LAP2\u03b1 regulates cell cycle \nprogression by binding to hypophosphorylated Rb and, as a \nconsequence, increases Rb\u2019s repressor function or delays its \ndeactivation during G1\u2192S-phase transition. However, we can-\nnot fully exclude the possibility that LAP2\u03b1 inhibits E2F ac-\ntivity via an Rb-independent function. To address this question \ndirectly, we performed E2F reporter assays in triple knockout \n(TKO) mouse embryonic fi broblasts (MEFs) in which all three \npocket proteins (Rb, p107, and p130) were knocked out (Sage \net al., 2000). These cells express normal levels of LAP2\u03b1 and \nlamins A\/C compared with wild-type fi broblasts (unpublished \ndata). Endogenous E2F activity was not affected by the over-\nexpression of LAP2\u03b1 in TKO MEFs (Fig. 4 D). In contrast, the \nexpression of Rb alone or in combination with LAP2\u03b1 reduced \nE2F activity to a similar level (approximately twofold), al-\nthough the coexpression of Rb and LAP2\u03b1 was slightly more \neffective than Rb alone. The high level of Rb expression in \nthese transient transfection assays is most likely suffi cient to \neffectively repress E2F activity so that the additional expres-\nsion of LAP2\u03b1 may not signifi cantly increase this activity. \nOverall, we concluded that LAP2\u03b1\u2019s effect on E2F activity is \nstrictly dependent on the presence of the pocket proteins Rb, \np107, or p130.\nFigure 5. Overexpressed LAP2\ud835\udec2 affects the expression of endogenous \nE2F target genes. mRNA levels of the E2F target genes cyclin D1, thymi-\ndine kinase, and cyclin E and of actin as a control were determined by \nsemiquantitative RT-PCR from control 3T3 cells (solid lines) or LAP2\u03b1-GFP\u2013\nexpressing 3T3 cells (dotted lines) harvested 0\u201324 h after serum addition \nto serum-starved cultures.

To test whether LAP2\u03b1-mediated \nregulation of the Rb\u2013E2F pathway can also infl uence differenti-\nation, we used the 3T3 F442A clone. These cells proliferate in \nnormal culture medium and can be considered as preadipocytes, \nwhereas the addition of insulin and triiodothyronine (T3) to the \nculture medium induces cell cycle arrest and differentiation into \nmature adipocyctes within 10 d, as seen in the phase-contrast \nmicroscope by a morphological change from spindlelike pread-\nipocytes to rounded adipocytes with numerous fat droplets (Fig. \n6 A). Immunoblot analyses of total cell lysates revealed a switch \nfrom the high molecular weight hyperphosphorylated Rb in \nproliferating cells to the low molecular weight hypophosphory-\nlated form in adipocytes, refl ecting cell cycle arrest in G0 phase \n(Fig. 6 B). Furthermore, LAP2\u03b1 appeared as a double band in \nproliferating cells, representing mitotic hyperphosphorylated \nand interphase hypophosphorylated LAP2\u03b1 (Dechat et al., \n1998), whereas the hypophosphorylated form accumulated in \ndifferentiated adipocytes because of the lack of mitotic cells. \nFinally, the adipocyte-specifi c differentiation marker peroxi-\nsome proliferator\u2013activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3; Fajas et al., \n2002b) was expressed exclusively in differentiated cells, and \nlamins A\/C were slightly up-regulated in differentiated cells \n(Fig. 6 B). Overall, these data showed that in differentiation \n medium, preadipocytes enter G0 phase and differentiate to \n adipocytes in vitro.\nTo test the effect of overexpressed LAP2\u03b1 on differentia-\ntion, we used clones of the 3T3 F442A cells stably expressing \nLAP2\u03b1-GFP, which showed a delayed response in cell cycle \nentry upon serum starvation and restimulation (Fig. 1 B). Cell \ncycle arrest and morphological changes during differentiation \nas detected by phase-contrast microscopy did not differ signifi -\ncantly in several independent clones of LAP2\u03b1-GFP\u2013 expressing \nversus control cells (untransfected or GFP expressing).  However, \nwe did detect signifi cant differences by immunoblot analyses of \ntotal cell lysates. Hypophosphorylated Rb, LAP2\u03b1, and PPAR\u03b3, \nall of which are early markers of adipogenesis, clearly accumu-\nlated in proliferating LAP2\u03b1-GFP preadipocytes compared \nwith control cells, suggesting that the overexpression of LAP2\u03b1 \ninitiated early events in the differentiation pathway, accompa-\nnying a partial cell cycle arrest.\nUpon insulin\/T3 stimulation of LAP2\u03b1-GFP cells, hypo-\nphosphorylated Rb and LAP2\u03b1 accumulated similarly to the \ncontrol cells. In contrast, the expression level of PPAR\u03b3 did \nnot reach the levels observed in the control (Fig. 6 B), indicat-\ning that differentiation was incomplete. To test this possibility, \nwe stained for differentiation-specifi c lipid droplets using oil red. \nAs shown in Fig. 6 C, LAP2\u03b1-GFP\u2013expressing cells had signif-\nicantly fewer oil red\u2013positive droplets than control cells. Thus, \nalthough the overexpression of LAP2\u03b1-GFP initiated differen-\ntiation events in the absence of insulin and T3, further differen-\ntiation did not occur even in the presence of insulin\/T3.\nOverall, our studies show that LAP2\u03b1\u2013lamin A\/C \n complexes regulate G1\u2192S-phase transition via the Rb\u2013E2F \npathway and control the balance between cell proliferation \nand differentiation.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we analyzed the effects of LAP2\u03b1 on cell cycle \nprogression and differentiation and showed that decreased \nLAP2\u03b1 levels negatively affected the growth arrest response to \nserum starvation, whereas increased levels delayed the  transition \nfrom G0 to S phase.

In noncycling cells, Rb is hypophos-\nphorylated and is active as a transcriptional repressor. Hypo-\nphosphorylated Rb is bound to E2F transcription factors, blocks \nits transactivation domain, inhibits the recruitment of preinitia-\ntion complexes, and represses genes directly by recruiting \nchromatin -modifying proteins, including histone deacetylase \nHDAC1 (Brehm et al., 1998), methyl transferase Suv39h, and \nheterochromatin protein HP1 (Nielsen et al., 2001; Ait-Si-Ali \net al., 2004). Through sequential phosphorylation of Rb by cyclin\nD and E\u2013dependent kinases (Mittnacht, 1998), Rb is released \nfrom E2F, causing its activation as a transcription factor. Based \non our previous fi ndings (Dechat et al., 2000; Markiewicz et al., \n2002; Vlcek et al., 2002) and results reported here, we postulate \nthat nucleoplasmic LAP2\u03b1\u2013lamin A\/C complexes bind hypo-\nphosphorylated Rb, thereby delaying its deactivation and main-\ntaining E2F in a repressed state.\nThe molecular mechanisms as to how LAP2\u03b1\u2013lamin \nA\/C complexes exert their regulatory function on Rb are un-\nknown. However, several possibilities can be envisaged: fi rst, \nLAP2\u03b1 may regulate Rb phosphorylation. LAP2\u03b1 preferen-\ntially bound to Rb phosphorylated on serine 780, which is the \nfi rst serine to be targeted at the G1\u2192S-phase transition (Lundberg \nand Weinberg, 1998). Recruitment of Rb-S780 to LAP2\u03b1\u2013\n lamin A\/C may delay the phosphorylation of downstream \nsites. Alternatively, LAP2\u03b1\u2013lamin A\/C complexes may favor \nthe dephosphorylation of Rb, leading to its deactivation. \nIn line with the latter hypothesis, Van Berlo et al. (2005) have \nrecently shown that in Lmna knockout fi broblasts, TGF\u03b2-\n mediated cell cycle arrest is impaired through a less effi cient \nphosphatase PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation of Rb. Second, \nLAP2\u03b1\u2013lamin A\/C may recruit regulatory proteins to the \nRb complex. Third, LAP2\u03b1\u2013lamin A\/C may recruit Rb\u2013\nE2F complexes to subnuclear compartments or chromatin \n regions. Our fi ndings that LAP2\u03b1 complexes associate with \nE2F- dependent promoter regions imply that the cell cycle \nregulatory activity of LAP2\u03b1 acts directly on the promoter of \nE2F target genes. Fourth, in view of the reported destabiliza-\ntion of Rb in Lmna\u2212\/\u2212 fi broblasts by proteasomal degradation \n(Johnson et al., 2004), the interaction of Rb with LAP2\u03b1\u2013\n lamin A\/C complexes may stabilize the proteins. However, \nthis would imply that proteasomal degradation also contrib-\nutes to the  deactivation of Rb repressor activity at the G1\u2192 S-phase \ntransition, although no direct evidence for this has been \n reported so far. Furthermore, we did not see any changes in \nRb protein level upon the overexpression or knockdown of \nLAP2\u03b1.  Finally, it should be mentioned that another LAP2 \nisoform, LAP\u00df, was also found to down-regulate E2F activity, \nalthough the mechanisms are most likely different from that \nof LAP2\u03b1, involving the binding of LAP2\u03b2 to the protein \ngerm cell less (Nili et al., 2001) and to histone deacetylase 3 \n(Somech et al., 2005).\nWhat is the physiological relevance of LAP2\u03b1\u2013lamin A\/C \ncomplexes in cell cycle control? In cycling cells, these proteins \nmay provide additional checkpoint mechanisms, preventing \npremature entry into S phase. However, we consider it more \nlikely that LAP2\u03b1\u2013lamin A\/C complexes are involved in con-\ntrolling cell cycle exit during the differentiation of adult stem \ncells. Rb has been found to be essential for the differentiation of \nvarious tissues, including skeletal muscle and adipocytes (Hansen \net al., 2004; Huh et al., 2004). Inactivation of the Rb gene in \nproliferating myoblasts and in differentiated muscle fi bers in \nmice revealed that Rb is required for the initiation of myogenic \ndifferentiation but not for the maintenance of the terminal dif-\nferentiation state (Huh et al., 2004). Also in adipocyte differen-\ntiation, Rb facilitates the initiation of differentiation by inducing \ncell cycle arrest (Fajas et al., 2002a). Thus, Rb seems to be in-\nvolved in maintaining a balance between proliferation and dif-\nferentiation in adult stem cells (Classon et al., 2000). Adult stem \ncells do not proliferate but enter the cell cycle upon specifi c sig-\nnals and self propagate to maintain a stable population of stem \ncells in the tissue. At the same time, they differentiate to regen-\nerate damaged tissue or maintain a basic turnover of differenti-\nated cells (Wagers and Weissman, 2004). Our data suggest that \nLAP2\u03b1\u2013lamin A\/C complexes are essential cofactors of Rb in \nmaintaining the balance between proliferation and differentia-\ntion in adult stem cells. Similar to Rb, LAP2\u03b1\u2019s critical role \nwould be in transit amplifi er cells rather than in terminally dif-\nferentiated cells. Consistent with this hypothesis, the highest \nlevels of LAP2\u03b1 expression during the differentiation of skele-\ntal muscle satellite cells is just before entry into a postmitotic \nstate (Markiewicz et al., 2005). Moreover, by artifi cially main-\ntaining high levels of LAP2\u03b1 expression in preadipocytes, early \nevents in differentiation were enhanced but terminal differentia-\ntion was inhibited (Fig. 6). Therefore, we propose that the \nLAP2\u03b1\u2013lamin A\/C complex is critical for Rb-mediated entry of \nadult stem cells into a postmitotic state but is not required for \nterminal differentiation.\nDuring the last 10 yr, geneticists have identifi ed mutations \nin the human LMNA gene that give rise to pathological pheno-\ntypes in muscle, adipose, bone, neuronal, and skin tissue or \ncause premature ageing (Burke and Stewart, 2002; Mounkes \nand Stewart, 2004). Mice lacking lamin A\/C or expressing mu-\ntated lamin A\/C show similar phenotypes (Sullivan et al., 1999; \nMounkes et al., 2003; Arimura et al., 2005). The molecular ba-\nsis of these diseases is unclear. It may involve structural defects \nin mutated lamins, leading to nuclear fragility, or deregulated \nfunctions of lamins in gene expression (Hutchison and Worman, \n2004). As LAP2\u03b1 is involved in targeting a subfraction of lamin \nA\/C to the nucleoplasm (Dechat et al., 2000, 2004), it may \nbe relevant for the nucleoplasmic functions of lamin A\/C. If \n nucleoplasmic lamins together with LAP2\u03b1 control Rb in cell \ncycle progression and differentiation, disease-causing muta-\ntions in lamin A\/C may cause differentiation defects. In support \nof this model, the expression of a disease-linked lamin A mutant \nin C2C12 myoblasts (Favreau et al., 2004) inhibited the in vitro \ndifferentiation into myotubes, and the expression of wild-type \nand mutated lamin A inhibited the differentiation of 3T3 \ncells into adipocytes (Boguslavsky et al., 2006). We propose \nthat disease-causing mutations in A-type lamins perturb the bal-\nance between proliferation and differentiation in adult stem \ncells, leading to less effi cient tissue regeneration. This model \nwould help to explain the late onset of the disease during \n o\nn\n August 29, 2008 \nw\nw\nw\n.jcb.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n Published April 10, 2006\nLAP2\u03b1 IN CELL CYCLE CONTROL \u2022 DORNER ET AL. 91\n childhood or adulthood, an age when tissue regeneration be-\ncomes relevant, as well as progressive muscle weakness, which \nmay be caused indirectly by a defect in regeneration rather than \nby  direct degeneration (Gotzmann and Foisner, 2005). Intrigu-\ningly, mutations in the gene encoding LAP2\u03b1 have recently \nbeen linked to laminopathy-like cardiomyopathy (Taylor et al., \n2005). Disease-causing LAP2\u03b1 mutants bind less effi ciently to \nlamin A\/C, supporting the hypothesis that nucleoplasmic \nLAP2\u03b1\u2013 lamin A\/C complexes fulfi ll important functions.\nMaterials and methods\nCell culture\n3T3-F442A and HeLa cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C and 8% CO2 in high \n glucose DME medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 50 U\/ml penicillin, \n50 \u03bcg\/ml streptomycin, 0.2 mM glutamine (Invitrogen), 0.8 \u03bcg\/ml biotin, \nand 0.4 \u03bcg\/ml pantothenic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) for 3T3-F442A cells. \nConfl uent 3T3-F442A cells were differentiated with 17 nM insulin and \n2 nM T3 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 7\u201310 d. Lipid drops were stained for 1 h with \n0.3% Oil Red O (Sigma-Aldrich) after fi xation in 3.7% formaldehyde \n(Merck) in PBS for 2 min. For DNA fl ow cytometry, 5 \u00d7 105 cells in 1 ml \nPBS were mixed with 4 ml 85% ethanol at \u221220\u00b0C. Cell pellets were briefl y \ntreated with 0.05% aqueous pepsin, stained with 2 \u03bcg\/ml DAPI and \n15 \u03bcg\/ml sulforhodamine (Sigma-Aldrich) in 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mM \nMgCl2, and 0.1% Triton X-100, and analyzed with a fl ow cytometer (PAS II; \nPartec). For cell proliferation assays, 5 \u00d7 104 cells were seeded onto \n100-mm dishes (Nunc), and cell numbers were determined within 7 d \n using a coulter counter Z2 system (Scharfe System). For serum starvation, \ncells were grown in medium with 0.5% FCS for 5 d.\nTransfections and reporter assays\nLAP2\u03b1-myc HeLa Tet-on cells (Vlcek et al., 1999) were grown in medium \nwith 200 \u03bcg\/ml hygromycin and induced with 2 \u03bcg\/ml doxycyclin \n (Invitrogen). pTD35 encoding LAP2\u03b1-GFP was generated by cloning \nLAP2\u03b1 cDNA via NheI\u2013XhoI from pTD15 into a modifi ed pEGFP-N3 \n vector (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.) as described previously (Vlcek \net al., 2002) and was used for stable transfection of 3T3 cells with \n LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Stable clones were selected in medium \nwith 700 \u03bcg\/ml geneticin.\nFor reporter assays, cells were cotransfected with 2 \u03bcg luciferase \n reporter p3xE2F-Luc (provided by H. Rotheneder, Medical University of \n Vienna, Vienna, Austria; Krek et al., 1993) and 2 \u03bcg \u03b2-galactosidase \ncontrol reporter plasmid pAD-CMV1-\u03b2gal (Eger et al., 2000) together \nwith various combinations of the following plasmids (1 \u03bcg each): pCI-neo-\nHA-E2F1 (Rotheneder et al., 1999), pCMV-Rb (provided by M. Busslinger, \nResearch Institute of Molecular Pathology, Vienna, Austria; Hinds et al., \n1992), pSV61 (full-length LAP2\u03b1 in pcDNA3.1), pSV62 (LAP2 common \nin pcDNA3.1), and pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Luciferase activity was mea-\nsured with the lumat system (Berthold) and normalized for \u03b2-galactosidase \nactivity. Relative luciferase activities were calculated as the light units rela-\ntive to the reporter plasmid controls. Data were obtained from at least \nthree independent experiments, and mean values and standard errors \nwere calculated.\nRNAi\npSHAG-1 vector containing a human U6 promoter fragment (\u2212265 to 1) was \nderived from pTOPO-ENTR\/D (Invitrogen) as described previously (Paddison \net al., 2002; http:\/\/katahdin.cshl.org:9331\/RNAi_web\/scripts\/main2.pl). \nHuman LAP2\u03b1-specifi c oligonucleotides encoding a shRNA were de-\nsigned as described (http:\/\/katahdin.cshl.org:9331\/homepage\/ portal\/\nscripts\/main2.pl?link=protocols&content=protocols.html): 5\u2032-A C T G A T-\n C A A T T C T C T T C T G G A A G C T T G C A G A A G A G A A T T G A T C A G T C T T T T T T -3\u2032 \nand 5\u2032-G A T C A A A A A A G A C T G A T C A A T T C T C T T C T G C A A G C T T C C A G A- \nA G A G A A T T G A T C A G T C G -3\u2032. Annealed oligonucleotides were cloned \ninto pSHAG-1 via BseRI\u2013BamHI. As a control, we used pSHAG-\nFF1 encoding a shRNA targeting fi refl y luciferase (gift of Greg\nHannon, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY; \nPaddison et al., 2002). Using the Gateway system (Invitrogen), shRNA \nexpression cassettes in pSHAG-1 were shuttled into pTRACER-EF\/Bsd \nplasmids in which a Gateway-compatible conversion cassette had been \nintroduced in a reverse orientation via EcoRV. The resulting RNAi vectors \n(pJG118 targeting LAP2\u03b1 and pJG121 control vector targeting luciferase) \nwere transfected into HeLa cells, and stable clones were selected with \n20 \u03bcg\/ml blasticidin (Invitrogen).\nChromatin immunoprecipitation and RT-PCR\nChromatin immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously \n(Hauser et al., 2002) with a few modifi cations. Cross-linking with formal-\ndehyde was performed for 15 min, and the soluble chromatin fraction was \ndiluted 1:10 in 16.7 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 167 mM NaCl, 1.2 mM EDTA, \n1.1% Triton X-100, and 0.01% SDS and was precipitated with monoclonal \nantibody 15 or antiserum 245 to LAP2\u03b1 or rabbit preimmune serum as a \ncontrol. Chromatin\u2013antibody complexes were isolated with 30 \u03bcl of pro-\ntein A\/G\u2013Sepharose beads and solubilized in 2% SDS, 0.1 M NaHCO3, \n10 mM DTT, and 250 mM NaCl overnight at 65\u00b0C. Samples were ana-\nlyzed by immunoblotting, or DNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform, \nprecipitated with ethanol, and dissolved in water. The immunoprecipitated \nDNA was analyzed for cyclin D1, thymidine kinase, E-cadherin, and his-\ntone H4 promoter sequences by PCR using a thermocycler (PTC-200; MJ \nResearch) and PuReTaq Ready-To-Go PCR beads (GE Healthcare). The lin-\near range for each primer pair was determined empirically using different \namounts of genomic DNA. PCR products were resolved on 2% agarose \ngels.

Aliquots of the resulting products were used as tem-\nplates for specifi c PCR amplifi cations using PuReTaq Ready-To-Go PCR \nbeads (GE Healthcare). The conditions for PCR reactions were optimized \nfor each primer pair. All cDNAs were normalized according to actin ex-\npression levels.
