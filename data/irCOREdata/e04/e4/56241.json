However, description, interpreta-\ntion and analysis of this dense realm has generally proceeded through\ndiscussions of aesthetic attributes, semiotic significance and the mean-\nings that such designed objects convey. This paper argues that this\ninterpretative focus has occluded the extent to which the environment\nof consumer goods has been increasingly marked by the eclipse of the\nfunctional utility of such artifacts. Following the insights of Donald\nNorman, Albert Borgmann and Ivan Illich, three dimensions of use-\nvalue, the cognitive, the experiential and the convivial respectively,\nare considered. The origins of a dynamic towards the eclipse of use-\nvalue will be outlined and alternative approaches to understanding the\npractical significance of such designed objects will be advanced.\nKeywords: use-value, design, cognition, engagement, conviviality\nIntroduction\nWhilst it appears a straightforward proposition to equate everyday life with\nmaterial objects it remains a relatively under theorised area in many com-\nmentaries. For example, it is ironic given the central role that Marxism\nassigns to the commodity form that it should actually profess little interest\nin the physical qualities of objects themselves beyond asserting the contradic-\ntion between their use and exchange values (though see Baudrillard, 1996).\nRather, commodities are often represented as a simple means of linking the\nprocesses of production and consumption; they stand as ciphers. Yet the\nphysical qualities of manufactured objects can reveal much. The focus de-\nveloped here centres around the relationship between the physical nature of\nmanufactured objects and the concept of use-value (Thrift 2003). As such,\nthe following analysis does not focus on use as a social act of improvisa-\ntion, neither does it concentrate upon the phenomena of either intended or\nunintended secondary, adapted use (Preston, 2000). The social relations of\nexchange are also largely left to one side (Gregson & Crewe, 2003). Rather,\nthe argument here contains two main emphases: Firstly, the extent to which\nusefulness is related to the object\u2019s intended and planned physical charac-\nteristics and, secondly, that a normative approach to use-value conceived in\n2\nsuch terms is both insightful and warranted. The first theme rests on the idea\nthat an object\u2019s purposefully designed material nature may suggest or allow\na highly \u2018constrained\u2019 set of functional purposes (Latour, 2000) or invite a\nbroad range of \u2018useful\u2019 possibilities. The second theme is supported by the\nbelief that the objects of consumption are not neutral entities divorced from\nthe normative concerns of a critical theory of society. Rather, the manner\nin which the physical characteristics of many objects mediate human action\nhas substance for those wishing to advance such a perspective. Specifically,\nuse-value here is explored through cognitive, experiential and convivial cri-\nteria\nWhat of the geographical significance of such concerns? At this point\nthey remain more latent than developed, mainly, perhaps, because I am not\na geographer. Nonetheless, certain avenues of geographic exploration suggest\nthemselves. For example, focusing on the cognitive attributes of manufac-\ntured products may lead into an appreciation of the \u2018micro\u2019-geography of\nobjects, to the geography of the object in use and so on. The resonance\nwith time-geography particularly could be fruitfully pursued (see Jackson\n& Thrift, 1995) as could the embodying of use-value through geographical\nobject-relations approaches (Wood, 1998). The experiential dimension of\nuse-value invokes the spatial relations of engagement with material culture,\npublic-private, the spatial and temporal \u2018displacement\u2019 of engagement and\nso on (Willis, 1999), while a focus on conviviality draws attention to similar\nconcerns (Schivelbusch, 1992). These will be foregrounded where possible.\nThe \u2018objectness\u2019 of everyday life and rise of the sign\nContemporary academic fascination with designed objects has tended to em-\nphasise their semiotic and symbolic attributes. As this has coincided with\nan unprecedented differentiation and proliferation of available commodities\nsome accounts have tended to see this as a primary point of demarcation\nbetween modern and post modern societies (see Featherstone, 1991). This\nemphasis on the cultural meanings attached to objects has drawn attention\nto their visual significance and the messages they are seen to carry in relation\nto memory, ritual, identity construction and so on (Shields, 1992). Everyday\nlife, it is argued, is becoming increasingly \u2018aestheticised\u2019; firstly, the \u2018design\u2019\ncomponent of commodities is seen to be increasingly important in assigning\n3\nvalue and, secondly, the marked aestheticised and stylised look of the ob-\njects to be consumed is stressed (Featherstone, 1992). The 1980s, as both\nthe decade of post modernism\u2019s ascendancy and as the \u2018Design Decade\u2019, cap-\ntured this aspect well. It is argued that consumers encourage and demand\nsuch aestheticisation in that they treat the objects of consumption as pri-\nmarily signs rather than as tangibly useful objects, eschewing the supposed\n\u2018functionalist logic of use-value\u2019 (Attfield, 2000: 85)\nDespite the fact that historical comparison carries particular difficulties,\ncurrent conditions can be regarded as an intensification of processes of aes-\ntheticisation that have a long history. For example, the ostentatious de-\nvelopment of arcades, window displays, and department stores, at the end\nof the nineteenth century, mirrors the increased aestheticisation of the con-\ntemporary period. During the twentieth century manufacturers have often\nemphasised the aesthetic qualities of commodities through Worlds\u2019 Fair, Ideal\nHomes\u2019 Exhibitions, aggressive advertising and pronounced product styling.\nWhilst such techniques were used in the 19th century in connection with\na growing provision of consumer goods which were aimed at affluent social\ngroups, it is only since the latter 20th century that such techniques have been\nexplosively elaborated.\nThe separation of the spheres of production and consumption results in\na commodity form devoid of physical clues as to the social relations of its\nproduction and this vacuum of meaning is of immediate advantage to capi-\ntal as the exploitative relations of its production are hidden from view (Lee,\n1993). However, this lacuna also provides promotional industries with a\nready made opportunity to produce a set of substitute meanings that may\nboth further obscure the nature of productive relations and attach altogether\ndifferent meanings to specific objects. The chief ways that this can be done\nare through advertising, packaging and commodity aesthetics and retail dis-\nplay. The promotional industries of capitalism have explosively developed\nsuch techniques in their attempt to naturalise the experience of proliferating\nconsumption. For example, commodity aesthetics, or product styling, has\ndeveloped many novel aesthetic and representational forms in order to fill\nthe gulf of meaning that the commodity form displays (Haug, 1986). From\nthe 1920s and 1930s onwards the proliferation of mass produced relatively\naffordable, standard goods was accompanied by a new commodity aesthetics\n-\u2018form follows function\u2019- an emblematic motif of modern design. Such func-\ntional design was itself the correlate of standardised, mass production based\n4\non long-run, interchangeable components and, later, planned obsolescence.\nA new form of aesthetics developed through which concepts such as speed,\nefficiency and progress could be represented. Such aesthetics were part of a\nmode of cultural regulation, according to Lee (1993), which aimed to ease\nthe \u2018transition to modernity\u2019. In contrast to Europe, in America this de-\nveloping industrial aesthetic was quickly attached to consumer goods and\ntheir marketing. For example, streamlining had originally been developed in\naviation technology to counteract wind resistance. However, from the 1930s\nonwards it could be found on myriad products both within the transport field\nand outside. All manner of commodities that never experienced drag were\ncovered with symbolic aerodynamic pretensions,\n. . . the relevance of the tear-drop look became completely unclear\nwhen applied to such things as refrigerators, stoves, meat-grinder\nhandles, electric irons, orange juicers, and radios, Wind resistance\nseems a strange preoccupation for the designers of such products\n(Packard, 1960: 119)\nWhat streamlining was able to do was to bring characteristics of the capi-\ntalist mode of production -speed, progress, efficiency-and attach them to the\ncommodity form. According to Ewen (1976), streamlining provided a sym-\nbolic solution to the problem of how the ideals of capitalist modernity could\ncut through the traditional cultural values and insinuate themselves in ev-\neryday consciousness with the least popular resistance (see also Lichtenstein,\nn.d.).\nThe \u2018temporal aura\u2019 of such commodities was often purposefully forward\nlooking. The use of materials, colour, and shape and the incorporation of\nsophisticated technological symbolism into everyday objects carried particu-\nlarly optimistic meanings. For example, images of atomic structures, rockets,\nand molecular crystalline structures all proliferated in the 1950s and 1960s on\nfabrics, wallpapers, and the most mundane of consumer commodities. Such\nimagery reflected the faith placed in the advanced sciences of the day. The\nshort term anticipation of new commodities and, the longer term expectation\nof a technologically driven superabundant future were both explicitly part of\nthe material structure of many consumer objects.\nIn contradistinction, the post modern commodity often seems to look\nbackwards. Form and function have been increasingly distanced so, for ex-\nample, one can buy technically advanced goods that have been styled in\n5\nforms from a different era. This should not be regarded as a wholly novel\nor post-modern development. The early twentieth century reaction of both\nArt and Crafts and pioneer modernist designers to Victorian ornamentation\nand stylistic recycling is notable. It is, rather, the intensification of such\ntechniques that helps define the post modern articulation and, certainly,\nsuch techniques have flourished in the last fifteen years especially (White-\nley, 1994). Bricolage, eclecticism, montage and pastiche are all used, along\nwith increasingly rapid turnovers in style, to emphasise an incongruence be-\ntween function and presentation. Examples include vaguely familiar \u2018retro\u2019\ndesigned goods such as radios which are composed of an ersatz Bakelite shell\naround up-to-date technological components or, explicitly technologically ad-\nvanced goods which make allusions to the past through their styling. The\nfirst iMac computer with its 1950s\u2019 cartoon-like carcass or the Dyson vacuum\ncleaner with its entirely superfluous plastic and non-functioning heat dissi-\npation fins are noteworthy here. Many multiple \u2018readings\u2019 of the meanings of\nsuch objects are seen to be possible in our almost pansemic material culture.\nIt has been argued, however, that the \u2018sensory overload\u2019, that results from\nthe processes of rapid stylistic turnover and commodity differentiation, is a\nform of \u2018semiotic pollution\u2019 which makes it impossible to read any stable\nmeanings into post modern commodities,\n. . . the multiplication and continuous transformation of forms,\ncolours, and textures of objects can lead to the impossibility of\nreading any real difference and real meaning in them. So it can\nfollow that all these colourations and extravagances form a com-\nplex image that is confused, grey, and flat...The multiplication\nand change in products are going forward at such a rate that\nfar exceeds the subjective capacity to develop codes that permit\nreading their possible significance (Manzini, 1995: 241).\nThis criticism captures the sometimes excessive contemporary enthusiasm\nfor reading practically any narrative into any cultural product: if objects are\nsemiological overloaded then, whilst their real meaning as commodities in the\nexploitative political economy of capitalism remains obscured, many possible\ninterpretations and meanings can be generated from the wealth of semiotic\nmaterial available (Gottdiener, 1995).\n6\nHowever, the extent to which such commodity aesthetics, along with ad-\nvertising, are successful in generating a will to consume has been a matter of\ndebate. Many accounts of consumerism overstate the degree to which such\nstrategies, especially advertising and its attempts to engineer false needs,\nhave been successful (Packard, 1957). Some are altogether more cautious\nabout the susceptibility of people to the ideological manipulation associated\nwith advertising and other meaning generating techniques (Lodziak, 1995,\n2002). Batchelor (1994) maintains that where mass production existed it\nwas never as homogeneous as many accounts assume. Once product differen-\ntiation, seasonal and technical obsolescence, and niche production have been\nconsidered, the idea of uniform production of standardised commodities for\na universal market becomes largely mythical and, hence, the promotional\nmeaning making strategies that are seen to be derived from such techniques\nbecome questionable.\nThe slow erosion of use-value?\nIt can be argued that use-value used to matter more than it does now. Prod-\nuct design, especially, used to be more clearly about use-value, adding utility\nto goods to make them function in a safer, more predictable, more ratio-\nnal, and more efficient manner. Whilst adding economic value in order to\nincrease profits, and adding sign-value in order to give meaning have always\nboth been important to design in market economies, nevertheless the \u2018power\u2019\nof design was publicly seen to be manifested in its ability to increase util-\nity, adding use-value through improvements in function, in performance, in\nsafety, in convenience and, in ease of use.\nOf course, design does add intended use-value to products in many ways.\nThe increased safety of many household objects has often come about from\nthe efforts of designers to minimise the risk of injury and ill-health that could\nresult from poor design. Treatments and fabrics that retard the spread of\nflames, devices that switch off electric equipment if left unattended, auto-\nmobile air bags and so on. However, designers are often responding to legal\nsafety requirements set from outside of the design professions and not coming\nfrom within. Consumer design also adds use-value in terms of convenience.\nA caveat is again in order though. Many labour-saving devices produce more\nlabour, and many time-reducing technologies simply increase the work one\nhas to do (Whiteley, 1994). The improved technical performance of consumer\n7\ndesign goods also merits mention as an addition of use-value. Ever faster,\nmore powerful electronic communications devices would be a prime example\nin this category. Yet, again we must acknowledge that many of the claims\nmade for strict utility on this score are questionable. Is a computer that\npotentially may save you half a minute over the course of an hour\u2019s work but\nwhich demands increased time in order to learn its \u2018advanced\u2019 features really\nmore useful (Eriksen, 2001)?\nThere are, however, factors that indicate a general decline in the level\nof use-value offered by much contemporary product design. Firstly, there is\nthe common complaint of product obsolescence. Technical obsolescence com-\nmonly refers to the design of certain components such that their failure point\ncan be calculated and predicted to occur prematurely in relation to the prod-\nuct as a whole. Stuff is designed to wear out sooner than it could or perhaps\nshould. There is also stylistic obsolescence or fashion which by definition\nis the premature redundancy of myriad objects due solely to their semiotic\nattributes having been deemed \u2018out-of-date\u2019, usually by the industries which\nproduce and promote those goods but also by consumers. The critique of\nall \u2018built-in\u2019 obsolescence in general finds its fullest expression in the work\nof Packard (1960) which, though dated, still generally pertains. Planned\nobsolescence is not necessarily the result of evil, profiteering designers secre-\ntively including crucial but fragile components. Indeed, social legislation has\naided in protecting the consumer from such practices. Rather, obsolescence\nis an inevitable consequence of the development of consumer design products\nwithin the political economy of capitalism. Inter-firm competition, the need\nto maintain and increase one\u2019s market share and profits and the necessity to\n\u2018externalise\u2019 costs, generate this tendency towards built-in obsolescence1.\nThe increasing separation of engineering from surface design also works\nagainst many claims made in favour of utility. Designers of consumer goods\nthemselves increasingly have less knowledge of the sophisticated components\ncomprising many products, they often simply style the surface carcasses.\nConsumers may have even less knowledge of these mechanisms. This sit-\nuation is worsened as many contemporary product carcasses physically do\nnot allow access to internal mechanisms. Completely sealed units denying\naccess or, with access made available only via specialised tools, is bolstered\n1Such processes challenge claims concerning the environmental advantages of \u2018green\u2019\nproduct strategies such as \u2018design for disassembly (DfD)\u2019, recycling, and \u2018product-service\nwebs\u2019 (Maycroft, 2000).\n8\nby warranty agreements that become void if attempts are made to disman-\ntle the products. Safety and fragility may be reasons to deny access but\nare overplayed. It used to be a vital part of vernacular everyday culture\nthat home repairs to many products could be affected with the acquisition\nof some know-how and patience. This autonomy, in relation to both repair\nand in relation to simply learning to understand the nature of the designed\nartifactual world, is diminishing in a world in which shoes cannot be resoled\nand radios cannot be opened. Technical and legal constraints help prevent\nits re-emergence in relation to new products.\nIf many contemporary accounts of material culture have emphasised ap-\npearance, they have, conversely, minimised the significance of use-value ex-\ncept where the symbolic use of objects has been interpreted as an aspect of\nuse-value itself (Miller, 2001). Not only do people symbolically \u2018reuse\u2019 com-\nmodities once they pass into everyday life, they also invest then with new\nand varying use-values. A banal example would be the multiple use to which\na daily newspaper may be put (cleaning, packaging, fuel, pet bedding, etc)\nnone of which are explicitly intended by the producers of that commodity. It\nis the fluidity of use-value that challenges those accounts of consumption that\nlocate the significance of commodities entirely in their symbolic dimensions.\nHowever, there is no widespread agreement on just what the concept of \u2018use-\nvalue\u2019 means and the preceding discussion offers only generalities and vague\nintimations. Most of the objects which pass from saleable commodities into\neveryday objects are clearly useful in some way or other. The same is true\nof the raw materials, ingredients or partially assembled components which\nacquire their intended purpose after they have been productively worked on.\nWhat is offered here is a three-dimensional account of use-value derived from\ndisparate yet overlapping analyses of material culture. It represents an at-\ntempt to develop a multiform consideration of use-value which can be used\nas a way of both judging the usefulness of objects as well as indicating the\nmanner in which particular objects gain their peculiar significance as more\nor less useful in particular situations and in relation to particular modes\nof interaction with the people who use them. This approach considers the\ncognitive, experiential and social approaches to use-value.\n9\nThe cognitive approach to use-value: \u2018constraints\u2019, \u2018af-\nfordances\u2019 and \u2018tacit\u2019 design\nNorman (1988) has both defended the power of design as a socially reforming\nactivity whilst exposing its often poor cognitive character. Door handles that\ncognitively invite pulling but that need to be pushed, sign systems that do\nnot tell you where you are, and arbitrary mapping between control features\nand the functions they initiate have all been detailed by Norman, as well as\na series of alternative cognitive design criteria. On the one hand, we have\nincreased the use-value or functional scope and efficiency of many objects and\ndevices via technological means, whilst, on the other, use-value is undermined\nby the frustration caused by lack of cognitive comprehension. For Norman,\nthis inability to successfully use objects is in very large part down to poor\ndesign of the goods in question. He notes that helplessness in relation to\nmany domestic consumer products is commonplace; the familiar amusement\nexpressed concerning the inability to programme video recorders for example.\nIf an object requires labels, instruction manuals, expert operators, training\nsessions or warning stickers, it is, for Norman, indicative of poor cognitive\ndesign.\nNorman groups his cognitive complaints into a series of categories which\ncan both indicate the erosion of utility of a object and suggest \u2018cognitive\u2019\nremedies through \u2018natural design\u2019: \u2018visibility\u2019, \u2018mappings\u2019, \u2018affordances\u2019 and\n\u2018constraints\u2019. Good \u2018visibility\u2019 is that which enables us to immediately recog-\nnise the salt cellar from the pepper pot while too much visibility is the cog-\nnitive problem in relation to many electric devices and computer software:\ntoo many identical buttons having different functions or, too many menu\nand submenu commands to choose from. \u2018Mapping\u2019 refers to the relation-\nship between the controls on an object and the functions they initiate. Many\ndevices have far more operations than controls (the office telephone or digital\nwatch), fail to indicate when an operation has been successfully, or unsuccess-\nfully performed (lack of feedback from the video recorder that it has correctly\nbeen set) or fail to take advantage of \u2018natural\u2019 mapping (the way that the\nposition of light switches in a room does not correspond with the position\nof lights). \u2018Affordance\u2019 refers to the \u2018perceived and actual properties\u2019 of the\nobject or device in question and they \u2018provide strong clues to the operations\nof things\u2019 (Norman 1988: 9). For example, flat plates are for pushing, knobs\nfor turning, slots for inserting things into. Many objects do not take advan-\n10\ntage of such affordances such as when doors have flat plates which require\npulling and are, hence, usually accompanied with a sign instructing one to\ndo the opposite that cognitively the object\u2019s affordances suggest. Conversely,\n\u2018constraints\u2019 control or at least suggest what is not possible. They are used\nto prevent the wrong thing from happening. The unidirectional bezel on\nquality diving watches is an excellent example of a constraint. Constraints\ncan be physical as in the above example, semantic such as knowing the one\nmeaningful direction to face on a bicycle saddle, cultural, for example, the\nconvention that red lights indicate moving vehicles should stop and green\nlights that it is safe to proceed or, logical such that when one is assembling\nan item of flat-pack furniture one logically assumes that all the sheets of\n\u2018MDF\u2019 are to be used as part of the final construction.\nAccording to Norman, the cognitive usefulness of many objects has di-\nminished over previous years for several reasons: the increasing functional\ncomplexity of devices which outstrips the user\u2019s ability to keep up, the pres-\nsures on all producers to maximise profits and thus externalise as many costs\nas possible including the research and development costs associated with the\n\u2018natural\u2019 design Norman advocates (though many of the same manufactur-\ners willingly pay out great sums for the design of the complex information\nthat goes into instruction manuals) and, the lack of \u2018tacit\u2019 knowledge of the\ndesigners themselves who are often not the end users of their own designs\n(Whiteley, 1994). It is Norman\u2019s belief that the incorporation of his design\nprinciples will lead to an environment of far more \u2018useful\u2019 and easily operated\ndevices.\nWhile Norman\u2019s approach lacks an insight into the political economy of\nconsumer goods, as well as having been welcomed as part of an \u2018unexploited\ncompetitive edge\u2019 by business, it does at least suggest some interesting ideas\nabout why some things may be functionally superior \u2018use-values\u2019. For exam-\nple, one object that has become very popular over recent years is the Roberts\u2019\nor Bush post-war style radio. These are available as a \u2018retro\u2019 copy, rather\nthan pastiche, using new materials and current technology. It is tempting\nto interpret the popularity of such an object in terms of semiotic explana-\ntions, that it appeals to a sense of nostalgia, either positively or negatively,\nthat it revives memories of a different time and a different domestic and so-\ncial culture. This may be so but, it may also be that such radios were in\nNorman\u2019s terms a very good piece of cognitive design. They had only three\ncontrols, an on-off switch, a volume knob and a tuning dial which featured\n11\nthe names of individual stations printed around it. Compared to the func-\ntional complexity and cognitive opacity of many contemporary radios, the\nattraction of such \u2018old\u2019 models from the functional point of view is easy to\nsee. It may also be that with their \u2018engaging\u2019 under-geared tuning knobs and\nleather and wood components such radios \u2018disclosed\u2019 their properties much\nmore than contemporary plastic or metal versions do.\nHowever, Norman\u2019s approach rests on some questionable assumptions.\nFirstly, despite building his analysis on empirical observation, he tends to\n\u2018read-in\u2019 use-value in terms of cognitive deficiencies. There is neither an\nappreciation that the design fault may lay elsewhere or that cognitive be-\nhaviours are socially acquired and are highly changeable both within and\nacross cultures. Our cognitive patterns may seem universal and \u2018natural\u2019 but\nthey are not. The ethically and ecologically-minded designer Victor Papanek\nhas shown how different cultures develop cognitive abilities which to us seem\nunlikely and incredible but which constitute part of the daily apparatus of the\ncultures involved. The Inuit ability to read text left-to-right, right-to left and\nupside-down is related by Papanek to the particularities of cognitively nego-\ntiating the environment they have traditionally inhabited (Papanek, 1995).\nClearly, cognitive abilities and thus cognitive design criteria are to some ex-\ntent culturally specific.\nThe second, and underlying, assumption of Norman\u2019s approach is that\npeople are first and foremost information processors which again throws em-\nphasis onto the cognitive attributes of the artifactual world. Offering al-\nternative models of cognitive development does little to challenge this basic\nassumption and many would wish to offer other criteria for both their start-\ning points in considering human behaviour, for example Actor Network The-\nory, and in terms of examining use-value (see Bingham, 1996, Miller, 1995a,\n1995b). Indeed, Norman himself has recently emphasised the role that emo-\ntion plays in design and in the use to which people put products (Norman,\n2004).\nThe experiential dimension of use-value: \u2018engagement\u2019\nand \u2018disburdenment\u2019\nThis aspect of use-value concerns the experiential \u2018qualities\u2019 of objects which\nare expressed in terms of the kind of \u2018engagement\u2019 that is offered. Borgmann\n12\n(1995) gives the example of musical instruments as objects which deeply en-\ngage and television programmes as things that typically fail to engage. A\nuser may turn to either to provide musical entertainment but where the mu-\nsical instrument must be engaged with in order to make music, the television\nrequires a simply push of a button on a remote control. Consider another\nexample: one\u2019s need is for warmth and there are clearly a number of ways\nin which this heat could be generated. The most engaging would be the\nlaying of a fire using materials that one had gathered. The least engaging or\nmost disburdening would be switching on the central heating system. The\nhistory of capitalism has, according to Borgmann, been the history of grow-\ning disburdenment and of diminishing engagement as attention paid to the\nproducing artifact has receded to be replaced by an immediate concern with\nthe commodity produced, music or heat in the above two examples. Much of\nthis has been technologically driven as improvements in the performance of\nmaterials and components has produced functionally more \u2018efficient\u2019 devices.\nIn this, a certain amount of disburdenment has been welcome as it has freed\npeople from many tiring and time consuming chores associated with the op-\neration and maintenance of functionally simple devices. However, beyond\na certain point, engagement is reduced to such a minimum that knowledge\nand understanding of the object itself becomes increasingly obscure. This\nproduces further disburdenment, manifested, for example, in the inability\nto effect simple repairs. Increasing product elaboration and differentiation\nhas seen the qualitative and quantitative exaggeration of this disburdenment\nas there is often little correspondence between the mechanical components\nand surface decoration of a given product. Disburdenment is then doubly\nreinforced as the complex mechanisms are increasingly hidden from view,\nand hence not open to engagement and, as the surface appearance of objects\nincreasingly becomes disjoined from their functional capacities.\nIn calling for the rediscovery of engagement Borgmann highlights its spa-\ntial character asserting that, \u2018The world of engagement. . . has two principle\nsettings, a large one in the city and a small one in the home; and both of\nthese have a daily and a festive side\u2019 (1995: 17). Daily engagement in the\ncity is manifested in everyday errands and spatial practices that appropriate\npublic space including walking, sitting, reading, eating, and playing. Despite\nthe increasing rationalisation of public space, such engagement is constantly\nrecreated as new and old spaces are appropriated and reappropriated. There\nis also festive engagement in the city. Borgmann laments the destruction and\n13\nneglect of communal festivity and urges its the return city life as a means of\nexpressing and promoting such engagement (Borgmann, ibid).\nBorgmann also seeks to distinguish between the everyday and festive\nmodes of engagement in the home and daily engagement is manifested most\nobviously as housework. Whilst critical of both the highly gendered division\nof labour that characterises most housework and, the burdensome nature of\nmany domestic tasks, Borgmann claims that it does at least represent the\nextension of people\u2019s selves into the texture of their own environment. He ar-\ngues against the technological elimination of all housework, via the merging\nof automation with service industries and, also against its social elimination\nthrough the use of domestic servants. Technological elimination produces a\nsterile environment of highly disburdening devices while, social elimination\nis unjust and iniquitous (see Ehrenreich & Hochschild, 2003).\nFestive engagement in the home is best exemplified by activities including\n\u2018the culture of the table\u2019, conversing, story-telling and, the \u2018culture of mu-\nsicianship\u2019 (Borgmann, ibid: 18-20). The culture of the table includes both\nactivities of daily engagement such as the preparation, cooking, and cleaning\nup associated with eating but, these \u2018yield\u2019 to festive engagement through the\n\u2018celebration of a meal that engages and delights body and soul\u2019 (ibid: 18). In\nterms of the nature of the objects involved in such social practices, Borgmann\ndraws a clear distinction. On the one hand, there are those \u2018paradigmatic\ntechnological devices\u2019 such as microwave ovens, whose experiential qualities\nare primarily visual and which tend to reinforce disburdenment. In the case\nof microwave ovens focusing attention on the quick, clean and isolated pro-\nduction of a hot meal at the expense of engagement with the smell and taste\nof ingredients, the handling of utensils and the appreciation of the process of\ncooking. On the other hand, there are those objects that \u2018disclose\u2019 their prop-\nerties including shape, weight, heat conductivity, surface texture, sound, and\nso on. Objects that invite engagement are distinguished by the multitude of\ntheir experiential qualities and by the disclosing power of those properties.\nFor example, a weighty, sonorous frying pan which slowly accretes a patina\nfrom repeated use would be seen to be far more disclosing than a plastic\nmicrowave dish.\nBorgmann\u2019s analysis perhaps licences a view which overplays the extent to\nwhich the recession of the artifact diminishes the significance of the commod-\nity produced. For example, many may well take a complacent attitude to the\nproduction of home heating, seeing only the central heating thermostat and\n14\nan on\/off switch. But what if the heat produced is used to warm a room in\nwhich the production of thoroughly engaging activities takes place, learning\na musical instrument for example? The temporal and spatial displacement\nof engagement is also significant in this regard. A pragmatic attachment\nto transport as a commodity does not preclude engagement at the end of\nthe journey undertaken. Indeed, the search for engagement itself may be-\ncome a laborious pusuit of an anticipated \u2018authenticity\u2019 of experience which\nconstantly evades capture.\nThe social context of use-value: \u2018convivial\u2019 tools and\n\u2018radical monopolies\u2019\nIvan Illich\u2019s notion of \u2018convivial tools\u2019 is a useful resource that can be adapted\nas part of a critical analysis of use-value. Illich uses the term \u2018disvalue\u2019\nto describe how we, as a result of the increasingly commodified satisfac-\ntion of needs, become robbed of some quite narrowly defined abilities or\nskills (affecting simple repairs, basic cooking, knowledge of plants, flowers\netc). According to Illich, though, this loss of skills is also the loss of the\nself-determined inter-connective \u2018moments\u2019 of people\u2019s everyday lives. This\ncomes about as a result of us making fewer collective choices for needs satis-\nfaction and increasing our dependence on private consumption. For example,\nmass personal ownership of garden equipment lessens the occasions when one\nmay interact with one\u2019s neighbours through borrowing such items, devalues\nborrowing and sharing and undermines the exchange of vernacular, local or\nspecific knowledge regarding gardening conditions. Such practices tend to be\nreplaced by a narrower range of expert and commodified alternatives. Con-\nsequently, the production of nonmarketable use-values via convivial tools is\nplaced at the centre of Illich\u2019s account. Tools is a broad term which signi-\nfies more than just the practical hardware of everyday life and Illich offers\ncriteria for judging the conviviality of a particular tool: \u2018Biological Degrada-\ntion\u2019, \u2018Radical Monopoly\u2019, \u2018Overprogramming\u2019, \u2018Polarization\u2019, \u2018Obsolescence\u2019\nand \u2018Frustration\u2019. \u2018Biological Degradation\u2019 refers to the ecological costs of\ncurrent levels of production and consumption (Papanek, 1995). Much eco-\nlogical destruction takes place either temporally or spatially displaced from\nthe object either in production or after it has been discarded (though eco-\nlogical destruction is also a result of use, e.g. the motor car) and, to various\ndegrees, may be independent of the features of an object\u2019s immediate use\n15\nbeing considered here. Energy usage and efficiency are aspects of \u2018biological\ndegradation\u2019 that could be manifested in immediate use of an object; many\nfunctionally specific devices relying on batteries or fixed power supplies litter\nthe domestic environment and Illich favourably compares hand tools to the\nmass of power tools and gadgetry which are routinely used to perform simple\ntasks.\n\u2018Radical monopoly\u2019,\nBy radical monopoly, I mean the dominance of one type of prod-\nuct rather than the dominance of one brand....Radical monopoly\nexists where a major tool rules out natural competence. Radical\nmonopoly imposes compulsory consumption and thereby restricts\npersonal autonomy. (Illich, 1973: 52-53).\nIllich gives the example of how the undertaking industries have imposed\na radical monopoly over burial and how building restrictions curtail one\u2019s\nautonomy to build one\u2019s own dwelling. The attempt of Microsoft to im-\npose radical monopoly over computer hardware, software, file formats and\noperating systems is notable in this regard. Such radical monopolies tend\nto be implemented by and through structurally justifying organisations and\ninstitutions. Moreover, they tend to establish a coherent set of material\nobjects. So, for example, with industrially produced food, the products are\nproduced and grouped around variously functionally specific household appli-\nances. The electric refrigerator, for example, exerts a radical monopoly over\nfood cooling and storage as modern central heating produces over-warm do-\nmestic environments that require specialist food preservation technologies.\nMoreover, the pressure to reduce building costs provides a justification to\nbuild new properties without pantries for cool storage. Furthermore, many\ncontemporary foodstuffs, using complex production techniques based on the\nuse of high levels of artificial additives, actually require refrigeration in order\nto prevent premature spoiling. So, bread without preservatives, flour en-\nhancers, and the like will gradually go stale (ie, still useable for breadcrumbs\nand certain recipes) in a pantry while bread containing \u2018preservatives\u2019 often\nquickly goes mouldy and unusable if not refrigerated.\n\u2018Overprogramming\u2019 occurs as people acquire ever more skills in relation\nto their tools at the expense of deeper understanding. As a consequence the\nsharing of knowledge tends to diminish as the dissemination of superficial\n16\ninformation increases. There are a number of consequences; a reduction of\ngeneral lay or vernacular knowledge and a rise of expert technicians, op-\nerators, repairers and servicers who defend their monopoly of expertise in\nrelation to tools. For example, premium rate telephone lines often retain\na monopoly of information and expertise in relation to domestic electron-\nics as many such objects are \u2018overdetermined\u2019 often allowing little personal\nautonomy of use, repair or disposal.\n\u2018Polarisation\u2019 draws attention to the fact that the \u2018modernising\u2019 of poverty\npivots around a dream of \u2018hyperconsumption\u2019 and abundance for all. The\npoor of industrialised societies are told that the solution to their poverty is\nrepresented by their potential to consume at the same levels as those of the\nrich. Although new commodities are continually presented as basic necessi-\nties high disparities of consumption obtain. This is true of the distribution of\nparticular objects (for example, the exceedingly uneven distribution of per-\nsonal computers and access to the world of \u2018on-line\u2019 information and services)\nand in terms of their cost of ownership. Leasing, for instances, is common-\nplace as a means of owning certain goods but, many on low incomes often\nhave this as their only means of securing access to certain items. However,\nthe costs incurred via this kind of ownership far exceed the average retail\ncosts for such products. Moreover, the idea that leasing of this kind leads to\nmanufacturers and retailers providing the most durable, well designed and\nenvironmentally benign commodities is contentious. It is often reconditioned,\npre-owned and older, less energy and resource efficient models that are made\navailable for leasing or renting.\n\u2018Obsolescence\u2019 has already been discussed above and Illich makes many\nsimilar points arguing that there is a constant lag between possession and\nwhat is available alongside a concerted attempt to convince us to replace\nwhat we have with what we could have. The attempts of the computer\nindustry to get us to \u2018upgrade\u2019 both hardware and software at regular in-\ntervals is notable. Rapid technological development combined with technical\nincompatibility between systems, hardware and software all aid this dynamic\ntowards obsolescence. The fact that many incompatible components are of-\nten manufactured by the same company through subsidiary divisions adds\nto the suspicion that obsolescence is indeed planned or \u2018in-built\u2019. Illich also\nadds a critique of the unnecessary elaboration of products. The preponder-\nance of the \u2018superfluous within the necessary\u2019 (Lodziak 2002), often unwanted\nfeatures and unused functions, adds cost, ecological consequences and \u2018use-\n17\nlessness\u2019; that is, potential use which is never discovered or applied.\n\u2018Frustration\u2019 is the result of the \u2018negative returns\u2019 or \u2018marginal disutil-\nity\u2019 that occurs when \u2018ends become subservient to the tools chosen for their\nsake\u2019 (Illich, 1973: 79). Illich\u2019s well known example is the way in which a\nmisapprehension that transport is concerned with increased speed of travel,\nrather than with saving time or energy, leads to the situation in which people\ndrive fast cars two hours each way daily to work and back (time they would\nnot spend walking or cycling). However, there are other common domestic\ndevices, lauded for their use-value, which have similar effects: time saved\nmixing ingredients in a food processor can easily be offset by the increased\namount of time required to assemble, prepare, dismantle and clean the object\nitself (Whiteley, 1994). The increased usage of scarce time is the most com-\nmon disutility that accrues from the use of these non-convivial tools. The\nirony is that pressures on one\u2019s time often lead to the adoption of these \u2018tools\u2019\nin the first place in a misconceived belief that they represent the solution to\nthe scarcity of time experienced, just as the lure of the fast car lies in the\nmistaken belief that it will \u2018save\u2019 commuting time (Eriksen, 2001).\nConvivial tools reduce \u2018overprogramming\u2019, \u2018polarization\u2019, \u2018frustration\u2019 and\nso on and allow for the autonomous production of use-values,\nTools foster conviviality to the extent to which they can be easily\nused, by anybody, as often or as seldom as desired, for the ac-\ncomplishment of a purpose chosen by the user. . . They allow the\nuser to express his meaning in action (Illich, 1973: 22).\nSimple devices such as hand tools and services such as the public library\nsystem are convivial tools and, against those who regard conviviality as a re-\nturn to pre-modern or craft based production, a common accusation, Illich ar-\ngues that convivial tools are not synonymous with low technological content.\nAs an example of a highly convivial tool Illich praises the public telephone\nsystem. Thirty years on we could cautiously include the mobile telephone,\nportable computers and other digital information storage and distribution\ntechnologies. Nevertheless, their remains an aura around Illich\u2019s ideas, and\nexamples of concrete application, which suggests that the technology of in-\ndustrial societies leads overwhelmingly to loss and impoverishment (Hoinacki\n& Mitcham, 2002). In contrast, we may note that new skills and associated\n18\nvalues come as readily into existence as they are lost. Digital communica-\ntions technologies demand new skills as well as recasting the technological-\nsocial-cultural matrix within which communication is perceived, defined and\npromoted . There is a notable spatial dimension to conviviality. Not only\ndo established convivial spaces persist -libraries, allotments, pubs- but the\nconstant re-making of conviviality produces new spaces, networks, activities\nand \u2018tools\u2019 such as Local Exchange Trading Schemes and the cultural ecolo-\ngies of independent creative practitioners characteristic of many towns and\ncities (Shorthose, 2002) We can also note the spatial and temporal displace-\nment of conviviality and the manner in which non-convivial tools can give\nrise to conviviality at different spatial scales; as one referee of an earlier draft\npointed out, a non-engaging, paradigmatic and non-convivial tool such as an\nelectric bread maker readily yields a product that may contribute to a both\nfestive and convivial coming together at a different location.\nRelating the dimensions\nOne is tempted to say that use-value is increased the more cognitive affor-\ndances an object has, the more engaging and disclosing it is and the more\nconvivial its use potentially is. Indeed, one could build a kind of \u2018ethics\u2019\nof use-value from this perspective. Such a perspective may be particularly\nattractive to ecologists or socialists in making normative prescriptions in rela-\ntion to their respective critiques of overconsumption or reification. If, for ex-\nample, particular products could be shown to be cognitively \u2018disarming\u2019, non-\ndisclosing, non-engaging and anti-convivial then such considerations could be\nadded to those of resource depletion, pollution, cost of ownership and so on.\nIn a culture that promotes every invitation to consume as an opportunity\nto exercise choice rather than a cost, such analyses may provide additional\ncritical ammunition. More romantically, just as Marcuse (1964) called for\nthe \u2018aesthetic reduction\u2019 of technology to free objects from all oppressive and\nundesirable connotations while liberating their natural and life-enhancing\npotentialities, the call for a \u2018material reduction\u2019 of designed products could\nsignal the desire to reject that which is cognitively opaque, non-engaging and\nanti-convivial. This, though, should not be made synonymous with Puritan\ncalls for the rejection of all decoration or ornamentation.\nMore pragmatically, it is clear that certain objects may have a high de-\ngree of use-value in relation to one or more of the dimensions but not in\n19\nanother. The mobile telephone is an interesting example. Cognitively, mo-\nbile telephones tend not to be exemplars of good design; too many functions\nfor the number of controls provided, a steep \u2018learning curve\u2019 in order to first\nuse them, poor mapping etc (though the inclusion of displays and aural feed-\nback increase their cognitive usefulness considerably). Experientially, mobile\ntelephones are also lacking in \u2018usefulness\u2019; engagement is confined to pushing\nbuttons on the surface of the device and few properties are disclosed through\nthe materials used in their construction. However, mobile telephones are a\nconvivial technology. Once access to the network has been gained, they al-\nlow users to exchange all manner of information for an unlimited number of\npurposes and in different ways (voice, text, pictures, video, music). There\nis, of course, clearly a non-convivial dimension to the mobile telephone too.\nThe aggressive marketing, promotion and upgrading of these objects would\nseem to confirm many of the dimensions of non-conviviality identified by Il-\nlich. There is certainly a strong flavour of radical monopoly in the manner in\nwhich they have come to represent communication itself. Text \u2018messaging\u2019\nor \u2018texting\u2019, for example, has not only tended to conceptually diminish the\nvalue of other types of text messages (hand written notes, letters, postcards)\nwith their differing spatial, temporal and cultural attributes but, has had real\neconomic impact on the industries that produce writing paper, postcards and\ngreetings cards. Increasingly fewer postcards are being sent and this draws\nattention to the fact that, although the scale and density of materiality in\nsocieties such as ours continues to increase, some aspects of our material cul-\nture may well be lost along with the associated skills and values which form\nthe connective tissue of their use.\nOther examples are equally as complex: the 3.5 inch computer floppy disc\nis cognitively excellent (it can only be inserted into the disc drive one way out\nof eight possible combinations), lacks engagement and disclosing properties\nbut is extremely convivial (portable, shareable, ability to hold different kinds\nof information). We could counter pose Norman\u2019s approach to Borgmann\u2019s:\ncertain musical instruments may be cognitively very poorly designed though\nengaging (bagpipes) while a microwave oven may be cognitively superb yet\ndisburdening and so on. Of course, one may be thoroughly \u2018engaged\u2019 in the\nfrustration and complexity of poor cognitive design in the same way that one\nwould be in a puzzle. However, one chooses to engage with the complexities\nof a puzzle, one does not expect to be forced to negotiate such complexity\nwhen functional efficiency is called for. In fact, this kind of \u2018engagement\u2019 is\n20\nreally disburdenment and is largely independent of the disclosing properties\nof the object. Indeed, paying attention and engagement should not be made\nsynonymous. One can be fully engaged but not paying conscious attention\n(playing an instrument) or paying full attention but not engaged (trying to\nprogramme a video recorder). This recalls Heidegger\u2019s distinction between\nan object being \u2018ready-to-hand\u2019 (engagement but not conscious attention)\nand \u2018present-to-hand\u2019 (attention with or without engagement, see Verbeek &\nKockelkoren, 1997).\nThe intention behind the acquisition of an object needs to be borne in\nmind2. Potential users may be motivated by any combination of the di-\nmensions of use-value discussed. One buys a video recorder primarily for\nits functional ability and not for its engaging or disclosing capacities. Con-\nversely, one may acquire a musical instrument primarily precisely for the\nengaging qualities of both artifact and commodity. A second-hand item of\nclothing may appeal for little other reason that its disclosing power (Greg-\nson & Crewe, 2003). Conviviality of use may be the driving force behind\nthe procurement of a personal computer for the family and so on. Any of\nthese dimensions may overwhelm the others in determining the functional\nusefulness of an object in particular contexts.\nUseful and useless things?\nWhich objects would satisfy the criteria that Norman, Borgmann and Illich\npropose, are there examples of outstanding use values? Consider the bicycle;\ncognitively, they are well designed displaying natural mapping, cognitive af-\nfordances, constraints of many kinds, visibility and feedback. The bicycle is\nalso a highly engaging device requiring absorption in it as an artifact in order\nto produce its \u2018commodity\u2019 - movement. The bicycle is also convivial allowing\nmany different kinds of user to use it for many different purposes and without\nimpinging on the actions of others. Yet there is more to be said about such a\ncommonplace object. Consider the role of technology; the ongoing develop-\nment of bicycle technology at the \u2018high\u2019 end and its gradual transfer across\nthe range of available bicycles can alter the relationship and balance between\n2I use different verbs to denote acquisition deliberately as many accounts of consump-\ntion see little beyond the buying of commodities as though no one ever comes by anything\nvia state provision, finding, stealing, sharing, borrowing, swopping, libraries, leasing or\nhiring (Gregson & Crewe, 2003).\n21\nthe cognitive, experiential and convivial dimensions of use-value. For exam-\nple, it could be argued that the cognitive opacity of bicycles is increasing.\nConsider integrated gear and brake levers; not only is it not obvious which\nlevers are associated with which wheel (a bicycle design convention which\nis reversed on American cycles) but it is also not always clear which lever\noperates the brake and which the gearshift. The direction of lever movement\nis often also not cognitively mapped to the direction the chain shifts on the\nchainrings. More gears and integration may give more options and better\nperformance but there is also more to learn and remember. The same point\napplies when one considers bicycle maintenance. Increasingly complex parts\nincluding suspension forks and seat posts require cognitive attention. How-\never, this also increases the opportunities for engagement with the bicycle\nwhich for some enthusiasts may be welcome but for others may be seen as\na burden. Conversely, it could be argued that engagement is decreasing; the\nreplacement of friction gears which had to be \u2018felt\u2019 for with indexed gears\nwhich move the chain across the rings by a fixed amount, for example. Or,\ntake the widespread use of cleated pedals; many cyclists initially complain\nthat they are too \u2018engaging\u2019 connecting the rider to the bike to an uncom-\nfortable degree. After, regular use however, this discomfort lessens as one\nbecomes less aware of the cleat and the pedal becomes increasingly \u2018ready-\nto-hand\u2019. Convivial complexity can also be uncovered and Borgmann makes\nthis very point in relation to Illich\u2019s championing of the bicycle as a convivial\ntool,\nIllich,. . . would restore a more human scale to our dwelling and\ntravelling by restricting all speeds to that of a bicycle, 15 mph. . . But\nwhat if technology gives us human-powered vehicles that allow\nus to move at 50 mph? Would not conviviality have to accept\nthe present patterns of commuting and population distribution\n(Borgmann, 1984: 168)?\nIn the thirty years since Illich fixed the figure of convivial speed at 13-\n15mph, technology transfer has, indeed, resulted in a situation where travel-\nling at 17-19mph by bicycle is as easy as 13-15mph used to be. Geographers\nwould be well placed to make telling interventions concerning the spatial di-\nmension of conviviality; identifying the spaces, scales and technologies that\nwould enable conviviality in action.\n22\nPerhaps a negative approach would bear more fruit; what is the acme of\nnon-usefulness in relation to the cognitive, experiential and convivial dimen-\nsions identified here? A quick trawl through two recent product catalogues,\nan \u2018Innovations\u2019 type consumer gadgetry booklet and the latest \u2018Bettaware\u2019\ncatalogue, reveals some interesting objects which, while they have a clear\n\u2018function\u2019, are not very useful from the perspective developed here. For\nexample, we may argue that one does not need a \u2018battery powered spider\nvacuum\u2019 because not only does it represent a waste of scarce resources but\nalso because it is based on a highly reified view of non-human nature as well\nas not being readily adaptable for any other purpose. Similarly, the \u2018Lean,\nmean, fat-reducing grilling machine\u2019 is highly functionally specific (drain-\ning fat from high fat foods) which obscures less technologically sophisticated\nmeans of achieving the same end using a simple frying pan, distances the user\nfrom the engaging activities associated with food preparation and invites in-\ncompetence in relation to alternative values and means such as thinking\nabout the nature of the meat industry or buying low fat food.\nCommentators who praise the choice, pleasure, meaning and even \u2018free-\ndom\u2019 of consumption will take an antagonistic view of such an approach\n(Mackay, 1997). Apart from questioning consumer sovereignty and choice,\nthe argument may be advanced that such prescriptions are an attack on the\nmeaning that people derive from consumption. However, as many accounts\noverload acts of consumption with meaning and significance this must be\nexpected (Fiske, 1989). For example, one product catalogue currently offers\n\u2018multi-use handy clips\u2019 and suggests that they may be used to re-seal open\nbags, clip together bills and so on. Basically, these clips are spring-loaded\nclothes pegs with two significant differences; firstly, they are many times\nmore expensive than an equivalent number of pegs, and, secondly, they have\nbeen restyled into a variety of shapes and \u2018kitchen\u2019 colours such that they\nare argued to be more attractive and distinctive than ordinary pegs. An\nemphasis on the symbolic aspects of consumption may stress the meaning,\npleasure and fun that the purchase and use of such objects may inspire; they\nmay be a talking point for the family, they may be prominently displayed\nin order to attract the admiration of neighbours or friends, and so on. A\nfocus on use-value would stress their conviviality but would ask what is their\nuse-value advantage over ordinary pegs with their capacity for adapted and\nimprovised functionality? The answer is that they have no functional ad-\nvantage. The point is not particularly to denigrate their use as markers of\n23\nmeaning but, rather, to argue that accounts of their use may be tempted\nto overload them with such significance. They are pegs masquerading as\n\u2018handy\u2019 clips; useful, adaptable but prosaic. They may convey all manner\nof meanings to different people in particular situations but, they are not\nthemselves meaningful in the sense of being significant. Overloading the\nmost mundane of objects with significance helps to obscure other aspects of\nthe political economy of consumption that may be more revealing (Lodziak,\n2002). For example, would anyone\u2019s life be seriously diminished if one could\nnot purchase \u2018Neuticles\u2019, prosthetic testicles for neutered dogs, which claim\nto restore lost \u2018self-esteem\u2019 to both the animals and their owners? Only the\nmanufacturers and those who cynically construct and promote the idea that\nthere is a need for them, that is, those who seek to attach significant meaning\nto their consumption.\nIn a more positive vein, some activities may illustrate the benefits of\nartifacts that manifest the functional, experiential and social dimensions of\nuse-value. One reason why gardening, cooking and home improvement may\nbe so popular could be to do with the use-value they encompass as well as\nthe often commented on meaning they involve. All may feature the use of\nwell designed implements that are cognitively \u2018transparent\u2019 as well as engag-\ning through their operation. They require raw materials, tools and utensils\nthat are replete with disclosing properties. The processes of production in-\nvolved are also engaging and rewarding in terms of the experiential properties\ninvolved through the extension of one\u2019s self into one\u2019s environment though\noften they are practised alongside more routine technological provision using\ndisburdening devices (Rybczynski, 1989). Additionally, such activities can be\nconvivial in different ways; they represent the satisfaction of needs through\nthe autonomous production of further use-values, they can be practised eas-\nily and by many different people, they may have a strong social dimension\ninvolving the sharing of equipment, know-how, end produce, etc., and be\npractised collectively. Despite the reliance on the commodified provision of\nraw materials and tools, and the relentless injunctions of media \u2018experts\u2019,\nsuch activities remain of interest here.\nCommercially there has recently been a recognition that both cognitive\nusefulness and engaging capacity can be used as a competitive edge in prod-\nuct development and promotion (Press & Cooper, 2003). Whilst some rel-\natively small and high-end companies have long promoted themselves by\nmaking a virtue of clear cognitive design, it has, of late, found a much more\n24\nreceptive and widespread audience throughout industry. Similarly, provid-\ning engagement and disclosing power are increasingly becoming part of the\nbrief of designers across many product domains. Recent examples include\n\u2018organic\u2019 product styling and its accompanying rhetoric (designing kitchen\nutensils such that they are regarded as a \u2018garden of objects\u2019 which invite\nattention, care and preservation, see Manzini, 1995), the move towards wood\nin much contemporary architecture, and the reappearance of materials such\nas leather and wood on electric equipment from cameras to radios. Manufac-\nturers also engineer \u2018bogus\u2019 cognitive affordances and disclosing properties;\ncar producers have been known to use heavy sounding door clicks in light\nbodied models, fabricated wood on plastic dashboards and leather aromas\non vinyl seats. What is found much less often in contemporary consumer\ndeign is a concern with the criteria of conviviality advocated by Illich. Of\ncourse, there is much rhetoric concerning sustainability and \u2018green\u2019 product\ndevelopment but, most professional product designers are tightly locked into\npolitical economic structures which demand the constant expansion of con-\nsumption and not the self-limitation that Illich calls for. As Billet observes\n\u2018...it is rare to find designers who believe in less design, in terms of less prod-\nucts, less variety, less novelty and a life style of \u201cconspicuous thrift\u201d -rather\nthan the norm of \u201cconspicuous consumption\u201d\u2019 (Billet et al, 1996: 3).\nConclusion\nWhen the objects of material culture are viewed in the ways discussed above,\nit becomes increasingly challenging to define what use-value actually encom-\npasses. Most of the commodities that become the objects of everyday life\nare obviously useful in some sense. However, to return to a point made\nearlier, the analysis provided here risks being accused that it is overloading\nsomething interesting with unwarranted significance. After all, what is be-\ning discussed is simply the shape, materials and components that comprise\n\u2018mundane\u2019 products. To an extent, this is true, such concerns are not central\nto a critical theory of society, rather, they are interesting but marginal. An\negalitarian, democratic and open society characterised by \u2018poor\u2019 use-values\nis preferable to an unequal, undemocratic and closed society replete with\n\u2018excellent\u2019 use-values. However, the dimensions of use-value discussed above\ncannot be simply lifted out of broader concerns, arising as they do out of a\npolitical economy that promotes waste, obsolescence, functional specialisa-\n25\ntion and commodification as the primary means of needs\u2019 satisfaction. The\nanalyses offered by Norman, Borgmann and Illich do suggests ways in which\nto discriminate between objects that further de-skilling and disburdenment\nand those which help to restore conviviality, vernacular subsistence, and en-\ngagement. Geographers accepting such a challenge would have much to offer\nin this regard and, for all of those interested in the restoration of such values,\nthis kind of analysis may be of some \u2018use\u2019.\nAcknowledgments\nI would like to thank Ben Anderson for his support and encouragement of a\nnon-geographer, probably a trying experience.
