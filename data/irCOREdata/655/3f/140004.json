Introduction \nWastewater reuse has developed from a basic method of disposing wastewater \nwithout any treatment to an often highly engineered technique of wastewater upgrading \nand water resources augmentation in water scarce regions throughout the world.  \nDue to limited water resources, typically water stressed countries in dry climates \nlike Australia, Israel and the State of California have developed wastewater reuse \nstrategies and programmes acknowledging the beneficial role wastewater reuse can play \nin integrated water management [1-3]. \nThe water stress situation in Europe is illustrated in Figure 1, revealing that most \ncountries exhibit a water stress index (a country\u2019s ratio of water abstraction to total \nrenewable freshwater resources) of less than 20 %. Italy, Germany and Spain range \nbetween 20 % and 30 %, whereas Belgium, Bulgaria, Malta and Cyprus exceed 40 %. \nThe population of the countries of these two categories makes up approximately 200 \nmillion people.  \n   \n \nFigure 1: Water stress index for European countries in 2000 (Map provided by [4]) \n \nParallel to increasing severity and frequency of droughts experienced in the early \n1990s and in summer 2003, sustainable use of water resources gains more and more \nimportance.  \nIn the water policy frame this issue has been incorporated into the Water \nFramework Directive (WFD \u2013 2000\/60\/EC). Enacting the WFD, the European Union \nestablished an environmental policy which aims at achieving a good status of surface \nwater and groundwater in terms of quality and quantity. This will promote a sustainable \nwater resources utilisation and might favour wastewater reclamation and reuse as a \nviable option. But, on the European level, there are no legislative regulations concerning \nwastewater reuse so far, apart from the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive \n(91\/271\/EEC - UWWTD) which advises to reuse wastewater \u201cwhenever appropriate\u201d. \nThus the installation of wastewater reuse schemes across Europe has been carried \nout under country specific national or even regional guidance. Additionally, wastewater \nreuse potential estimates presented in the literature often exclusively cover particular \nregions or countries and are presented without any reference to quantification methods \napplied to derive the appraisal [5, 6].  \nThe basic aim of this paper is to present an approach to quantitatively assess the \npotential of municipal wastewater reclamation and reuse in Europe taking into account \npossible changes of today\u2019s circumstances and their impact on the projected reuse \npotential. \n2. Model development  \nThe estimation of water reuse potential in Europe presented in this paper is based \non a mathematical representation of that share of water demand and supply which can \nbe covered by reclaimed wastewater. (A more detailed explanation of the model \ndevelopment was presented at the IWA Conference in Marrakech, September 2004 [7]). \n   \nThe model is based on a straightforward mass balance approach describing the \nvolumetric flow of reused wastewater Q in a particular spatial or temporal context at an \nequilibrium point of supply and use of reclaimed wastewater. The basic model equation \nfor the assumption of reuse in different sectors is structured as follows:  \n( )\u2211\u2211 \u22c5+\u22c5\u22c5=\u21d2=\u22c5=\u22c5=\u22c5 iiii UEQQUUE \u03c6\u03b7\u03c6\u03c6\u03b7 21\n (E\nquation 1) \nE : Effluent of wastewater treatment plants [Mm\u00b3\/a] \nU : Total water demand [Mm\u00b3\/a] \nUi : Use of water in a specific sector i [Mm\u00b3\/a] \nQ : Volumetric flow of reused wastewater [Mm\u00b3\/a]  \n\u03b7 : Fraction of wastewater reclaimed, hereafter reclamation-factor [-] \n\u03c6 : Fraction of total demand covered by reclaimed water, hereafter reuse-factor [-] \n\u03c6i : Fraction of demand covered by reclaimed water in a sector i [-] \n \n2.1. Determination of variables  \nTo calculate a change in the total wastewater reuse volume during a time interval, \nthe current wastewater treatment capacity E, the fraction reclaimed (\u03b7) and reused (\u03c6) \nand the sectoral water demand (U) have to be known. Data on sectoral water use and \ntreated effluents were extracted from the EUROSTAT database, the FAO AQUASTAT \ndatabase and various national statistics. Information on wastewater reclamation and \nreuse (Q) is based on literature survey and the compilation of installations conducted by \nBixio et al. [8].  \nBased on this data collection the current values for both the wastewater \nreclamation and the reuse factor for a particular country were calculated. As water stress \nis regarded as a main driving mechanism behind wastewater reclamation and reuse a \ncorrelation between the above mentioned factors and a country\u2019s water use practice was \ninvestigated. In order to emphasise the different  \nimpacts of sectoral water uses, each was weighted according to its consumptive \ncharacter thus deriving the term of consumptive water use intensity A\u2019 according to the \nfollowing equation: \n \nresourcesfreshwater renewable Total\n 14.014.018.077.0\n'\n\u22c5+\u22c5+\u22c5+\u22c5= ELEINDPWSAGR UUUUA  (Equation 2) \n \nA\u2019 : Consumptive water use intensity \nUAGR : Water abstraction for agricultural use [Mm\u00b3\/a] \nUPWS : Water abstraction for public water supply [Mm\u00b3\/a] \nUIND : Water abstraction for industrial uses [Mm\u00b3\/a] \nUELE : Water abstraction for electricity generation [Mm\u00b3\/a] \n \nThe sectoral conversion factors were adopted from [9]. \nEventually, a correlation between consumptive water use intensity and both \nfactors was established and mathematically modelled by an empirical function, which \nproved to be most appropriate in representing the type of observed relationship (cf. \nFigure 2). \n   \nC\nyp\nru\ns \n(2\n02\n0)\nIs\nra\nel\nIs\nra\nel\n (2\n02\n0)\nC\nyp\nru\ns\nM\nal\nta\n (2\n01\n0)\nM\nal\nta\nA\nlg\ner\nia\n (2\n01\n0)\nSp\nai\nn \n(2\n01\n8)\nSp\nai\nn\nC\nre\nte\nIta\nly\nPo\nrt\nug\nal\nG\nre\nec\ne\nB\nel\ngi\num\nU\nK G\ner\nm\nan\ny\nPo\nla\nnd\nFr\nan\nce\nN\net\nhe\nrla\nnd\ns\n0,00\n0,25\n0,50\n0,75\n1,00\n1,25\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42 44 46 48 50 52\nConsumptive Water Use Intensity A'  [%]\nR\nec\nla\nm\nat\nio\nn-\nfa\nct\nor\n \u03b7 \n[-]\n0,00\n0,05\n0,10\n0,15\n0,20\n0,25\nR\neu\nse\n-fa\nct\nor\n \u03c6 \n[-]\nReclamation-factor, data\nReclamation-factor, model\nReuse-factor, model\nReuse-factor, data\n \nFigure 2:  Correlation of reclamation- and reuse-factor and consumptive water use intensity \n2.2. Scenario description \nThe established model implies that any deterioration of water availability or \nincrease in water demand will enforce a change of the consumptive water use intensity, \nthat on itself modifies both the wastewater reclamation- and reuse-factor, hence the \nreused wastewater flow Q. In order to depict the impact of decreasing water availability \nand increasing water demand different scenarios were tested. The assumptions for each \nscenario are summarised in Table 1.  \nFirst, the possible decline of water availability due to climate change was \nappraised referring to the results of the EuroWasser model by Lehner et al. [10]. This \nmodel is forecasting the impact of climate change on water availability in Europe for the \ntime horizons 2020s and 2070s. Due to their calculations some river basins will have to \ncope with heavily reduced water availability. Decreases of more than 10 % are projected \nfor some continental countries (Poland, Hungary) and South Eastern countries \n(Bulgaria, Romania, parts of Turkey) whereas most South European countries will \nsuffer from shortenings of 25 % and more. The First European Climate Assessment [11] \ncame to similar conclusions predicting a reduction of the mean annual flow in \nPortuguese river basins of 10 % to 20 %. Hence the reductions of water availability for \nthe water shortage scenarios III and IV were based on assumptions in these orders of \nmagnitude. \nChanges in water demand were estimated to the following premises. As, in \ngeneral, irrigated agriculture is much more productive than rain fed cultivation [12] the \nresumption and enforcement of irrigation practice in most of the eastern European \ncountries was assumed. In addition, planned extensions of irrigated land in Spain and \nPortugal were taken into account [5, 13]. \nTable1: Different scenarios and underlying basic conditions  \nScenario I II III IV \nProjection year 2025 \nPopulation  UN Population Division, Medium variant \n   \nWater availability Constant (ltaa 1961-1990) - 10 % - 25 % \nWater demand \n- changes due to population \ngrowth \n- constant specific water \ndemand \n- irrigated area and specific \nwater use invariant \n- slight increase of IND and \nELE due to minor economic \ngrowth \n \n \n- changes due to population growth \n- economic recovery of AC \n- increased electricity production AC \n- intensified agricultural IRR \n \nTreated wastewater assumption of full compliance with  UWWTD by 2025 \nGeneral \ncharacterisation conservative \ndemand \nincrease \ndemand increase +  \nwater shortage \nELE: water use for electricity production, IRR: irrigation water use, IND: industrial water use AC: Accession Countries,  \nltta: long term annual average \n \nAn improvement of the electricity supply in the Accession Countries entailed by \nincreasing demand and economic recovery will demand additional water resources or \nmight at least cause conflicts between competing water uses.  \nThe domestic water demand per capita is considered invariant. This causes changes of \npublic water supply sector\u2019s water demand according to population growth and \nconnection rates. \nThe overall resulting changes of consumptive water use intensity for the different \nscenarios are listed in Table 2. \nTable 2: Consumptive water use intensity for different scenarios [%] \nCountry Status 2000 Scenario I Scenario II Scenario III Scenario IV \nCyprus 39.6 51.9 51.9 57.7 69.1 \nIsrael 49.5 45.3 45.4 50.5 60.6 \nMalta 25.0 25.5 30.2 33.5 40.2 \nBulgaria 8.1 14.8 23.8 27.6 33.2 \nSpain 16.3 16.3 22.9 25.5 30.6 \nItaly 9.8 9.8 14.7 16.3 19.5 \nTurkey 11.2 11.4 11.6 12.9 15.5 \nPortugal 9.1 9.2 10.5 11.6 14.0 \nGreece 8.1 8.0 10.1 11.2 13.4 \nBelgium 6.7 6.1 6.1 7.5 9.0 \nPoland 3.7 3.7 3.7 5.7 6.9 \nFrance 3.6 4.6 4.5 5.1 6.1 \nDenmark 4.5 4.5 4.5 5.0 6.1 \nGermany 3.9 4.0 4.0 4.5 5.4 \nRomania 0.8 0.8 2.1 2.3 2.8 \nUK 1.2 1.3 1.3 1.4 1.7 \nNetherlands 1.0 1.1 1.1 1.2 1.4 \nHungary 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.1 1.3 \n \nAs expected, the scenarios easily cause an increase of the consumptive water use \nintensity for all countries by up to one third. Cyprus, Spain,  Malta, Portugal, Italy and \nBulgaria even experience an intensification of water stress by 50 %  to 100 % \nculminating in consumptive water use intensities between 14 % and 69 %. \n   \nObviously the level and thus the deterioration of water stress various remarkably \nbetween the countries. Entailed to these changes not only the impacts of water stress \nwill aggravate but also the number of affected people in Europe.  \n3. Results \nThe current status of wastewater reuse in some European countries and the \nprojected wastewater reuse potential according to the model calculations and scenario \nassumptions are both depicted in Figure 3.  \nThe simulation points out that there is a significant potential for an increased \nutilisation of reclaimed wastewater in many European countries, specifically in the \nMediterranean region. \n \n34\n7\n23\n3 2\n83\n0 3\n43\n8 1 2\n3\n3 3 0 1 5 6 2 8 0 0\n77\n9\n62\n1\n49\n6\n40\n9\n17\n0\n94 79 61 51 33 33 25 18 17 16 13 9\n13\n4\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\n800\n900\nSp\nai\nn\nIta\nly\nIs\nra\nel\nBu\nlg\nar\nia\nTu\nrk\ney\nG\ner\nm\nan\ny\nFr\nan\nce\nPo\nrtu\nga\nl\nG\nre\nec\ne\nPo\nla\nnd\nBe\nlg\niu\nm\nRo\nm\nan\nia UK\nCy\npr\nus\nCr\net\ne\nM\nal\nta\nNe\nth\ner\nla\nnd\ns\nHu\nng\nar\ny\nDe\nnm\nar\nk\nR\neu\nse\nd \nw\nas\nte\nw\nat\ner\n [M\nm\n\u00b3\/a\n]\nStatus year 2000\nScenario I\nScenario II -availability invariant\nScenario III - availability minus 10%\nScenario IV -availability minus 25%\n20\n92\n12\n61 16\n24\n \nFigure 3: Estimated wastewater reuse potential under different scenario conditions  \nSpain shows by far the highest projected reuse potential, which is supposed to \ntriple (Scenario II) or even grow six-fold compared to today\u2019s practice reaching a \nmaximum of 2,000 Mm\u00b3\/y.  \nSimilar increases are illustrated for Italy, Portugal, Greece and Turkey primarily \ncaused by a combined effect of high irrigation demand and reduced water availability. \nEven countries like Germany, Poland and the UK are supposed to develop their \nwastewater reuse practice under water shortage conditions. \nNot only the total amount of reclaimed water but also its substitution potential \nwith respect to a country\u2019s water management varies remarkably among the considered \ncountries. According to the model outcome, the demand coverage rate, i.e. the ratio of \nreused effluent to the total water abstraction (Q\/U), ranges from 17 % to 30 % in Israel \nand Malta and amounts to 3 % - 7 % in Cyprus and Spain. \nOn the whole, the reused wastewater volume would save between 1.0 % and 1.5 \n% of total water abstraction of European countries (including Israel) in the year 2025. \nThis is close to estimations for the USA, that project a substitution of 1.5 % of total \nfreshwater abstraction by wastewater reuse in the year 2000 (Kamizoulis et al., 2003) \n[14]. \n   \n4. Conclusions \nThe scenario analysis presented in this paper reveals an over-proportionate \nincrease in wastewater reuse potential with declining water availability in most \nEuropean countries. An average water availability curtailment of 25 % on a country \nlevel can already result in tremendous wastewater reuse potential increase. Any \naggravation of water restriction might consequently promote the reuse of wastewater. \nTherefore, the results presented in this paper may only serve as a yardstick. Water \nshortage might be much more severe than is expressed by the long term annual average \nwhich is just a very rough figure characterising a country\u2019s water availability. It does \nnot take into account the uneven spatial and temporal distribution and thus the efforts it \nmight already take to balance demand and supply on a regional level. The coverage of \nseasonal demand peaks, e.g. for irrigation or public water supply in tourist regions, \ninvolves the risk of aquifer over exploitation [15] if no abstraction restrictions or price \nincentives are asserted. \nIn addition, a series of dry years can easily push the average annual rainfall below \nany long term average. Recent declines in average precipitation compared to the 1960-\n1990 ltta are reported for several countries [16, 17, 18]. \nMoreover, a reduction of water availability is often caused by inappropriate \nquality of water resources (brackish groundwater due to saltwater intrusion) as well as \nby stipulated abstraction or supply restrictions for certain users. Such trends might cause \neven more severe decreases in water availability than assumed in the scenario presented \nhere.  \nNonetheless, the results do raise but naturally leave open the question how to \naccompany the realisation of this massive potential from a regulatory point of view and \nhow to shape an appropriate framework of incentives and implementation support \nmeasures. \nThe potential utilisation shall not contradict the \u201cwhenever appropriate\u201d claim of \nthe Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive, thus demanding the determination of \nappropriateness. To date, appropriateness has often been described primarily with \nregard to entailed health risk prevention hence aiming at the establishment of limit \nvalues for certain substances or even comprehensive risk assessment and management \npractices.  \nThese aspects will be of paramount importance for the wastewater potential \nrealisation in applications that could absorb huge volumes of water but are at the same \ntime sensitive to health objections, as for example groundwater recharge. \nIn other cases, switching from conventional water resources to reclaimed \nwastewater is primarily hindered by cost arguments. This would demand a re-evaluation \nof water and finally an economic anticipation of the potential environmental benefits of \nwastewater reuse.  \nHow to investigate the optimal or simply the most acceptable allocation of \nreclaimed water will be a crucial element in any wastewater reuse strategy as each of \nthe options will demand specific use-dependent incentives that might even differ from \ncase to case.  \nIt will be a future task to adjust the model variables, especially the reuse-factor, \ntaking into account its sensitivity to influences like regulatory constraints, pricing \nmechanisms and similar. \n5.
