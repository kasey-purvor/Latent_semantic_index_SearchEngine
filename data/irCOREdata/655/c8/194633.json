E-mail: Andrew.abbott@le.ac.uk;\nFax: 116 252 3789; Tel: 116 252 2087\nReceived (in Cambridge, UK) 30th October 2002, Accepted 8th November 2002\nFirst published as an Advance Article on the web 26th November 2002\nEutectic mixtures of urea and a range of quaternary\nammonium salts are liquid at ambient temperatures and\nhave interesting solvent properties.\nEutectic mixtures of salts have been utilised for a long time to\ndecrease the temperature for molten salt applications. In the\nextreme, ambient temperature molten salts have been formed by\nmixing quaternary ammonium salts with metal salts. This type\nof ionic liquid can be viewed as a deep eutectic resulting from\nthe formation of complex anions e.g. Al2Cl72 and Zn2Cl52 thus\ndecreasing the lattice energy and decreasing the freezing point\nof the system. Work in this area focussed on chloroaluminate\nsalts of imidazolium and pyridinium chloride. A variety of\ndifferent anions are formed in solution the ratios of which vary\nwith the changing aluminium chloride composition.1\u20133 These\nideas have recently been extended to other chlorometallate salts\nincluding ZnCl2, SnCl2 and FeCl3.4,5\nHalide salts can also form complexes with hydrogen bond\ndonors and previous work has shown that mixtures of urea with\nalkali metal halides form eutectics with melting points of < 150\n\u00b0C.6,7 While a few reports also exist for adducts of urea with\nother metal salts8,9 their use as solvents has been limited to high\ntemperature applications.10 In the current work we show that\nmixtures of substituted quaternary ammonium salts such as\nhydroxyethyltrimethylammonium (choline) chloride with urea\nproduce eutectics that are liquid at ambient temperature and\nhave unusual solvent properties. Fig. 1 shows the freezing point\nof mixtures of choline chloride and urea. A eutectic occurs at a\nurea to choline chloride ratio of 2. The freezing point of the\neutectic mixture is 12 \u00b0C, which is considerably lower than that\nof either of the constituents (mp choline chloride = 302 \u00b0C and\nurea = 133 \u00b0C) and allows the mixture to be used as an ambient\ntemperature solvent. This significant depression of the freezing\npoint must arise from an interaction between urea molecules\nand the chloride ion. This is consistent with the crystallographic\ndata for the solid adduct [(CH3)3N+CH2CH2OH-\n]2C2O422\u00b72(NH2)2CS which shows extensive hydrogen bond-\ning between the thiourea molecule and the oxalate anion.11\nPrevious work12 has also shown that the stable adduct\nPr4N+Cl\u00b72(NH2)2CO can be isolated although this has a melting\npoint of 160 \u00b0C. The existence of hydrogen bonding in these\neutectic mixtures can be observed using NMR spectroscopy.\nHOESY spectra of HOCH2CH2N+(CH3)3F2\u00b72(NH2)2CO show\nintense cross-correlation between the fluoride ion and the NH2\nprotons on the urea molecule. FAB-MS which was run neat on\na 1 choline chloride+2 urea mixture without a matrix showed the\npresence of Cl2 with two ureas (M2 = 155) and Cl2 with one\nurea (M2 = 95).\nTable 1 lists the freezing temperature, Tf, of a variety of\namide compounds mixed with choline chloride in a 2+1 mole\nratio. It is noticeable that only those compounds capable of\nforming hydrogen bonds with chloride ions demonstrate the\nformation of a homogeneous liquid with a significant decrease\nin the freezing point compared to the pure amide. It can also be\nseen that the amides with greatest ability to form hydrogen\nbonds (i.e. urea and thiourea) exhibit the largest depression in\nfreezing point when mixed with choline chloride. Comparisons\ncan be drawn between this type of solvent and the lithium\nperchlorate\/ diethyl ether system, although naturally in the latter\ncase the complex is formed with the cation and the ether is a\nliquid at ambient temperatures.13\nThis method of forming ambient temperature liquids is not\nlimited to choline chloride and Table 2 lists the freezing points\nof mixtures formed between a variety of quaternary ammonium\nsalts with urea. It is shown that as the symmetry of the cation is\ndecreased the melting point of the mixtures decreases which is\nanalagous to ionic liquids.1,4 Furthermore, a wide variety of\nfunctional groups can be used and the principle also works for\nother monovalent anions (e.g. NO32, BF42) that are capable of\nforming hydrogen bonds. Table 2 shows that the freezing point\nof choline salts with urea decrases in the order F2 > NO32 >\nCl2 > BF42 suggesting some correlation with hydrogen bond\nstrength.\nThese fluids exhibit unusual solvent properties that are\nstrongly influenced by hydrogen bonding. In general, com-\npounds capable of donating or accepting electrons or protons to\nform hydrogen bonds show high solubilities.

Also, because these liquids have a high anion\nconcentration they dissolve several metal oxides e.g. solubility\nof CuO = 0.12 mol dm23. Analogous properties are observed\nfor other mixtures in Tables 1 and 2. These are unusual solvent\nproperties when compared to most molecular solvents and are\nmore typical of the properties observed for ionic liquids.\nSimilarly for biphasic studies and extraction processes it is\neasy to predict the solvents that are miscible with these IMLs.\nSolvents capable of forming strong hydrogen bonds with a\nchloride ion tend to be miscible, e.g. ethanol, water and\nmethanol, and those that cannot are immiscible, e.g. acetone,\nacetonitrile, acetophenone, dichloroethane, diethyl ether, ethyl\nacetate, hexane, propylene carbonate, and toluene.\nThese deep eutectic solvents are highly conducting (ca. 1 mS\ncm21 at 30 oC), confirming that the ionic species are dissociated\nin the liquid and can move independently. Fig. 2 shows that the\nconductivity increases significantly with temperature.\u2021 The\nvalues are comparable to those for most imidazolium based\nionic liquids1 and an order of magnitude larger than for the\ncholine chloride\u2013zinc chloride system previously studied.4 The\nviscosity and conductivity are strongly affected by the amide\nand quaternary ammonium salt and hence the fluid properties\ncould be tailored for specific applications.14\nThis work has shown that mixtures of amides with quaternary\nammonium salts form low melting point eutectics that have\nunusual solvent properties. Additional advantages of this type\nof mixture is that it is sustainable, biodegradable and a large\nnumber of variants can be produced from readily available\nmaterials.\nThe authors would like to acknowledge Scionix Ltd. for\nfunding this work and Dr Gregor Rozenberg for helpful\ndiscussions.\nNotes and references\n\u2021 Viscosity was determined using a Brookfield DV-E viscometer and\nconductivity was measured using a Jenway 4071 conductivity meter. The\nquaternary ammonium salts were synthesised by the same general method.\nInto a Schlenk tube was typically placed 30 mmol of haloalkane which was\nfrozen in liquid-N2. The tube was then evacuated and an excess of Me3N (50\nmmol) added and the sample refrozen in liquid N2. The tube was then\nallowed to thaw in a dry-ice bath until reaching room temperature. The\nunreacted Me3N was evaporated and any unreacted haloalkane removed\nunder vacuum from the white solid which was obtained > 60% yield. All\nquaternary ammonium salts were recrystallised from ethanol and then\nrigorously dried under vacuum prior to use. The amides were obtained from\nvarious sources all > 99% purity and were dried under vacuum prior to use.\nThe mixtures were formed by heating the components to 80 \u00b0C and stirring\nuntil a homogeneous liquid was formed. The compounds were characterised\nusing ir, nmr and mass spectroscopy. (See ESI\u2020). The liquids were found to\nbe homogeneous mixtures of the two components i.e. no covalent bonds\nwere formed via side reactions. Since the mixtures are hydroscopic they will\nspontaneously adsorb water but under the measurement conditions the\nsamples studied were found to contain less than 1 wt% water (using nmr\nspectroscopy).\n1 T.
