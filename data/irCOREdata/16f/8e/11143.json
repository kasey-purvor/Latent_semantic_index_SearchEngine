The aim of this paper is to advance the current\nunderstanding of the spectral width parameter observed by\ncoherent high frequency (HF) radars. In particular, we ad-\ndress the relationship of a frequently observed gradient, be-\ntween low (<200 m\/s) and high (>200 m\/s) spectral width,\nto magnetospheric boundaries. Previous work has linked this\ngradient in the spectral width, in the nightside sector of mag-\nnetic local time, to the Polar Cap Boundary (PCB), and also\nto the boundary between the Central Plasma Sheet (CPS)\nand the Plasma Sheet Boundary Layer (PSBL). The present\ncase study investigates the former by comparison with the\n630.0 nm optical emission. No suitable data were available\nto test the second of the two hypotheses. It is found that\nduring the interval in question the spectral width gradient is\nwithin the region of the 630.0 nm optical emission. A com-\nparison of coherent and incoherent scatter radar data is also\nconducted, which indicates that values of high spectral width\nare typically collocated with elevated F-region electron tem-\nperatures. We conclude that the high spectral width region in\nthe interval under study is associated with particle precipita-\ntion and also that the spectral width gradient is not a reliable\nmethod for locating the PCB.\nKey words. Ionosphere (auroral ionosphere; ionospheric ir-\nregularities)\n1 Introduction\nThe magnetosphere is dynamic and the locations of differ-\nent plasma regimes within it evolve continually. The bound-\naries between the different regimes can move, for example,\nin response to coupling between the interplanetary magnetic\nfield (IMF) and the geomagnetic field, and magnetospheric\nsubstorms. In order to study the dynamical processes in the\nmagnetosphere it is necessary to follow the dynamics of the\nplasma regimes. Many of the processes that occur in the\nCorrespondence to: E. E. Woodfield\n(Emma.Woodfield@ion.le.ac.uk)\nmagnetosphere leave signatures in the ionosphere that can\nbe observed either from the ground or from space. Detecting\nand tracking the ionospheric signatures of magnetospheric\nprocesses is a task ideally suited to ground-based instruments\nbecause of their large spatial and temporal coverage.\nOf particular interest in the magnetosphere is the\nopen\/closed field line boundary (OCFLB). At ionospheric\naltitudes this is often referred to as the polar cap boundary\n(PCB), the polar cap being the region in the ionosphere that\nmaps to open field lines in the magnetosphere. Several iono-\nspheric proxies have been suggested for locating the PCB\n(e.g. Blanchard et al., 1995; Doe et al., 1997; Rodger, 2000).\nBlanchard and co-workers used DMSP satellite data to show\nthat a well-defined step in the intensity of the 630.0 nm emis-\nsion at its poleward edge locates the PCB to an accuracy\nof \u00b10.9\u25e6 invariant latitude in the pre-midnight sector. This\nstep indicates the change from high-energy precipitation on\nclosed field lines to the low energy, diffuse polar rain ob-\nserved within the polar cap itself.\nRecent work has suggested that a marked gradient between\nareas of high (>200 m\/s) and variable, and low (<200 m\/s)\nDoppler spectral width values measured by HF radars can\nalso be used as a proxy for the PCB on the nightside, since in\nthe case presented by Lester et al. (2001), it follows the pole-\nward edge of the 630.0 nm emission in the pre-midnight sec-\ntor. This spectral width gradient occurs frequently in radar\ndata both on the day and nightside (Baker et al., 1995; Du-\ndeney et al., 1998; Andre\u00b4 et al., 1999). On the dayside, the\nregion of high spectral width poleward of the spectral width\ngradient is a well-known signature of the cusp (e.g. Baker\net al., 1995; Andre\u00b4 et al., 1999; Milan et al., 1999). On the\nnightside, in addition to the PCB, the spectral width gradi-\nent has been linked to the magnetospheric boundary between\nthe central plasma sheet (CPS) and plasma sheet boundary\nlayer (PSBL) (Lewis et al., 1997; Dudeney et al., 1998). This\nboundary is located between two regions of closed field line\nplasma and will, therefore, map into the ionosphere equator-\nward of the PCB.\nSeveral physical explanations for the creation of these re-\n502 E. E. Woodfield et al.: A case study of HF radar spectral width in the post midnight magnetic local time sector\ngions of high spectral width have been suggested. Simula-\ntion runs through standard HF coherent radar analysis soft-\nware have shown that high spectral width values can be gen-\nerated by broadband wave activity in the Pc1\/Pc2 frequency\nband (Andre\u00b4 et al., 1999, 2000a). The presence of suitable\nwaves has been verified by satellite measurements of the cusp\nthat show a step-like increase of wave activity in the fre-\nquency band 0.2\u20132.2 Hz with electric field measurements of\na few mV\/m, coincident with cusp particles (e.g. Maynard\net al., 1991; Matsuoka et al., 1993). On the nightside, elec-\ntrostatic wave activity of a similar frequency range (assumed\nto be driven by electron precipitation) increases across the\nCPS\/PSBL boundary (Dudeney et al., 1998). Work by Schif-\nfler et al. (1997) and followed up by Huber and Sofko (2000)\nhas found SuperDARN double-peak spectra in the region\nof the low-latitude boundary layer (LLBL). These would\nnaturally lead to high spectral widths. They attribute the\ngeneration of these double-peak spectra to small-scale vor-\ntices (<26 km and <4 s lifetime) which are smaller than the\nnormal spatial and temporal resolution of the SuperDARN\nradars. They suggest that these vortices may be formed in\none of two ways. Ion precipitation spreads radially through\ncharge exhange collisions as it travels downwards in the\nionosphere (Davidson, 1965). Thus, if it is co-located with\nelectron precipitation (which does not suffer the same effect),\na radial electric field will be produced and hence, a vortex\nwill be the result. Alternatively, vortices may form as a result\nof the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability to be found at velocity\nshears, which, when located within a range cell, would them-\nselves be expected to produce a spectrum with more than one\npeak (Andre\u00b4 et al., 2000b). Andre\u00b4 et al. (2000b) also mod-\nelled the effect of a small vortex on the standard SuperDARN\nfitting software and concluded that a vortex smaller than 5 km\nwould not generate a clear multi-component spectrum in the\nradar data.\nIn this case study from 20 December 1998, one of the\nCUTLASS (Co-operative UK Twin Located Auroral Sound-\ning System) coherent HF radars, part of the SuperDARN net-\nwork (Greenwald et al., 1995), is used to show that a gradient\nbetween low and high variable spectral width is not neces-\nsarily a good proxy for the open\/closed field line boundary\non the nightside. We also demonstrate that elevated electron\ntemperatures caused by particle precipitation in the F-region\nmay be related to the region of high variable spectral width\nduring this period.\n2 Experimental overview\nThe CUTLASS pair is the eastern most pair of the Super-\nDARN network (Greenwald et al., 1995). The two CUT-\nLASS radars are located at Pykkvib\u00e6r, Iceland (64.5\u25e6 N,\n68.5\u25e6 E geomagnetic-altitude adjusted corrected geomag-\nnetic (AACGM) coordinates based on Baker and Wing\n(1989) will be employed hereafter) and at Hankasalmi, Fin-\nland (58.6\u25e6 N, 104.9\u25e6 E).

In standard common mode these range\ngates are 45 km in length with a distance to the first gate of\n180 km. The radars can operate at frequencies between 8 and\n20 Mhz. The fields-of-view of the two radars overlap to fa-\ncilitate bistatic velocity measurements.\nThe radar field-of-view covers some 4\u00d7106 km2, although\noften only a proportion of this area produces ionospheric\nbackscatter. There are two reasons for this, the first being that\nHF radio propagation in the ionosphere does not uniformly\nilluminate the region. Secondly, if there are no field-aligned\nirregularities, then there will be no targets to scatter from and\nhence, no backscatter. Therefore, care is required in deduc-\ning geophysical data from boundaries of backscatter, since\nthe edge may be due to the end of the region illuminated by\nthe radar and not the edge of the location of field-aligned ir-\nregularities. However, in this interval, the boundary in ques-\ntion is in the middle of a region of powerful backscatter from\nsimilar elevation angles and can, therefore, be assumed to be\ndue to a change in the physical characteristics of the irregu-\nlarities being observed.\nIn this study we only use Finland radar data, and the field-\nof-view from Hankasalmi is shown in Fig. 1. The radar was\nperforming 7 s dwell time scans on each beam with standard\ncommon mode range gates, although the beam direction re-\nE. E. Woodfield et al.: A case study of HF radar spectral width in the post midnight magnetic local time sector 503\nverted to beam 5 after each other beam to give a higher time\nresolution for beam 5 until 05:00 UT when the scan resumed\nits normal consecutive order. The time resolution for beam 9\nfrom 01:00 UT to 05:00 UT was 224 s and from 05:00 UT to\n06:00 UT it was 120 s. During the dwell time, when sound-\ning in a particular beam direction, the radar transmits a 7-\npulse sequence repetitively (approximately 10 multi-pulse\nsequences can be transmitted each second). Samples of the\nreturned signal are taken, correlated and integrated, so as to\ngive the auto-correlation function of the scattered signal for\neach range gate. As described more fully by Villain et al.\n(1987), the signal power, the rate of change of phase an-\ngle and the rate of decay of the auto-correlation function are\nparameterized, leading to an estimate of backscatter power,\nline-of-sight velocity and spectral width, respectively, of the\nparticular scattering targets occupying each radar range gate.\nThe spectral width is the particular parameter of interest in\nthis paper. It is strictly a measure of the correlation time\nof the radar signal. For example, the scattering properties\nof the ground remain fairly uniform with time and hence,\nthe spectral width of ground scatter is typically small. For\nionospheric scatter the coherence in the signal and hence,\nthe spectral width is normally related to the variation in the\nplasma flow in the radar scatter volume. In this paper, we\nconcentrate on identifying specific regions of radar scatter\nthat have a characteristic spectral width.\nObservations from two of the European Incoherent SCAT-\nter (EISCAT) radars have also been included in this work\n(Rishbeth and Williams, 1985). The VHF radar at Troms\u00f8\n(66.4\u25e6 N, 103.5\u25e6 E) and the UHF EISCAT Svalbard Radar\n(ESR) (75.0\u25e6 N, 113.0\u25e6 E), (Wannberg et al., 1997) provide\nestimates of a variety of plasma parameters including elec-\ntron temperature and ion velocity. The VHF radar at Troms\u00f8\nwas operating in split beam mode for the majority of the in-\nterval 01:00 to 06:00 UT on 20 December 1998; the two pole-\nward pointing beams are shown in Fig. 1. Beam one has an\nazimuth of 345.0\u25e6 clockwise to geographic north and beam\ntwo has an azimuth of 359.5\u25e6. Also shown is the equator-\nward pointing ESR beam which has an azimuth of 161.6\u25e6.\nAll three beams were at an elevation of 30.0\u25e6. Only data\nfrom the modes of operation described above are included in\nthis investigation.\nOptical observations from the meridian scanning pho-\ntometer (MSP) at Longyearbyen on Svalbard (75.0\u25e6 N,\n113.0\u25e6 E, AACGM) are employed. The MSP observes at\nfour different wavelengths, 427.8 nm, 486.1 nm, 557.7 nm\nand 630.0 nm. Only the 557.7 nm (green line) and 630.0 nm\n(red line) emissions are utilised in this study.

Each scan takes two seconds\nand repeats every 16 s.\nObservations from the IMAGE network of magnetome-\nters (Viljanen and Hakkinen, 1997) supply information about\nionospheric currents during the interval.

WIND was located at approximately (40RE , 60RE ,\n10RE), (X, Y,Z) in GSM coordinates during this interval.\n3 Observations\n3.1 Interplanetary conditions\nThe interval under investigation takes place on the morning\nof 20 December 1998, from 01:00 UT to 06:00 UT. The IMF\nand solar wind data taken by the MFI (Lepping et al., 1995)\nand SWE (Ogilivie et al., 1995) instruments on the WIND\nspacecraft are shown in Fig. 2. The spacecraft was located\nat (40RE , 60RE , 10RE), (X, Y,Z) in GSM coordinates\nfrom which point a time delay of \u223c 10 min from the satel-\nlite to the magnetopause has been estimated. This time delay\nhas not been added to any of the times referred to for the\nspacecraft. The z component of the interplanetary magnetic\nfield (Bz) is northwards at the spacecraft from 00:30 UT un-\ntil 02:25 UT, when it becomes weakly southward at first and\nthen more strongly southward after 02:50 UT. At 03:00 UT,\nBz then returns northward until 03:40 UT when it becomes\nvariable until 05:35 UT, after which it becomes increasingly\nsouthward. The y component (By) is positive until a sudden,\nlarge jump from +6 nT to \u22126 nT at 02:20 UT. It is variable\nafter this until another extended period of positive values be-\ngins at 04:35 UT. The x component Bx is approximately in\nantiphase with By throughout the interval.\nThe solar wind velocity at the spacecraft increases from\n504 E. E.

The density and pressure\nvalues indicate a trough between 01:20 UT and 02:20 UT\nwith the density decreasing sharply from 12 cm\u22123 to 7 cm\u22123.\nAt 02:20 UT, the density and pressure recover quickly to their\nprevious levels where they remain until 05:20 UT when an-\nother sharp decrease is observed.\n3.2 CUTLASS data\nThe Doppler spectral width, line-of-sight irregularity drift\nvelocity and backscatter power from beam 9 of the Finland\nradar from 01:00 UT to 06:00 UT on 20 December 1998, are\nshown in panels (a) to (c) of Fig. 3 (positive velocities are\ndirected towards the radar). To convert UT to magnetic lo-\ncal time (MLT) in the region of magnetic latitude covered\nby the CUTLASS Finland field-of-view, add approximately\n2.5 h to the UT. F-region backscatter is observed from 02:00\nto 05:00 UT northward of 65\u25e6 N during this time. The scat-\nter shown between 01:00 UT and 01:30 UT, and also from\n05:45 UT to 06:00 UT, has been identified as ground scatter\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\nR\nan\ng\ne \nG\nat\ne\n0 100 200 300 400 500\nSpectral Width (ms-1)\n%\n O\ncc\nu\nrr\nen\nce\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n(67.5oN)\n(83.0oN)\nFig. 4. A contour plot of spectral width distributions for beam 9,\nrange gates 20 (\u223c 67.5\u25e6 N) through 60 (\u223c 83.0\u25e6 N) for the interval\n01:30 UT to 05:30 UT. The colour scale indicates percentage occur-\nrence with the distributions normalised to the total number of obser-\nvations from each range gate. The very low spectral width values\nare not due to ground scatter.\nusing elevation angle data. The SuperDARN radars typically\nidentify data with spectral widths below 20 m\/s and veloc-\nity magnitude below 50 m\/s as arising due to ground scat-\nter. In general, this approach is highly effective. However,\nfor the particular F-region scatter interval between 01:30 UT\nand 05:30 UT of interest here, the standard method led to the\nmisidentification of some of the ionospheric scatter between\n68\u25e6 N and 75\u25e6 N as ground scatter. Consequently all ground\nscatter was identified by studying the elevation angle data.\nThe F-region backscatter power, panel (c) of Fig. 3, is con-\nsistently high throughout the interval 02:00 UT to 05:00 UT.\nThe position of the poleward edge of the F-region backscat-\nter varies between 73\u25e6 and 84\u25e6, while the equatorward edge\nremains fairly static between 67\u25e6 and 69\u25e6.\nIn the Doppler spectral width data, Fig. 3a, there is an area\nof low spectral width (< 200 m\/s) equatorward of a large area\nof high (> 200 m\/s) but variable spectral width. A typically\nsharp nightside gradient in width, \u223c 60\u00b1 30 m\/s\/degree, ex-\nists between these two regions and is shown by the white line\nin Fig. 3a. This boundary has been overlaid on all the other\npanels of Fig. 3 for comparison. A plot of the spectral width\ndistributions for each range gate from 20 to 60, covering a\nlatitude range from 67.5\u25e6 N to 83.0\u25e6 N, is shown in Fig. 4. A\nbin width of 20 m\/s has been used. The data are taken from\nthe interval of F-region scatter from 01:30 UT to 05:30 UT\nand have been normalized to the total number of observa-\ntions in each range gate. The very low spectral widths are\nnot a result of ground scatter since the time interval and range\ngates chosen contain only F-region scatter. There is an ob-\nvious change from distributions peaked between 0 to 20 m\/s\nE. E.

Two histograms displaying spectral width distributions for\n(a) beam 9, range gate 25 (\u223c 69.6\u25e6 N), and (b) beam 9, range gate\n39 (\u223c 75.3\u25e6 N). Each histogram is normalized to the total number\nof observations from that gate.\nup to range gate 30 (\u223c 71\u25e6 N), to those distributions where\nthe peak is around 250 m\/s above range gate 40 (\u223c 75\u25e6 N).\nIn between 71\u25e6 N and 76\u25e6 N, a transition between these two\nextremes is observed; this corresponds to the latitude region\nwithin which the 200 m\/s gradient moves during this inter-\nval. Figure 5 presents the distributions of the spectral width\nfor range gates 25 (\u223c 69.9\u25e6 N) and 39 (\u223c 75.3\u25e6 N) of Fin-\nland beam 9 for the interval 01:30 UT to 05:30 UT; the black\nlines on Fig. 4 show their location. It is clear that the more\nnortherly range gate 39 shows a much more rounded distribu-\ntion, with a significant percentage (\u223c 66%) of spectral width\nvalues larger than 200 m\/s, while range gate 25 has virtually\nno data points above 100 m\/s. Therefore, we feel justified\nin using a value of 200 m\/s when locating the spectral width\ngradient in the time series plots of Fig. 3. The form of the\nrounded distribution for gate 39 resembles closely that of the\nspectral width distribution identified by Baker et al. (1995),\nas being a proxy for the location of the cusp on the dayside.\nThe line-of-sight velocity data (Fig. 3b) indicates that the\nhighest velocities are at the poleward edge of the F-region\nbackscatter, and that these velocities have a component that is\ndirected towards the radar (in blue). The strong bursts of flow\nwith components towards the radar that occur at 03:10 UT\nand 03:50 UT are associated with pronounced velocity en-\nhancements in anti-sunward flow. There is evidence of long\nperiod wave activity (ULF) in the line-of-sight velocity data,\nfrom 02:10 UT to 04:00 UT between 69\u25e6 and 74\u25e6. The pe-\nriod of the wave is approximately 10 min. We return to this\nobservation in Sect. 3.4.\n3.3 Meridian scanning photometer data\nThe optical data for two wavelengths, 630.0 nm and\n557.7 nm, taken from the Longyearbyen MSP for the inter-\nval 01:00 UT to 06:00 UT on 20 December 1998 are shown\nin Fig. 3d and 3e, respectively. These have been plotted as a\nfunction of magnetic latitude, assuming an altitude of 250 km\nfor the emission at 630.0 nm and 110 km for 557.7 nm. The\nassumed altitudes are seen to be reasonable in the discussion.\nThere is structure in both the 630.0 nm and 557.7 nm emis-\nsions from 01:00 UT until 01:40 UT when a sudden decrease\nto very low intensity emission occurs. This lack of emission\nlasts until 02:40 UT. Coincidentally, the time-span of this\nmarked drop in intensity is the same as the density decrease\nobserved by WIND when a time lag of 20 min from the\nspacecraft is included. It may be possible that the two events\nare related in some way, with the additional delay of 10 min\na result of the reaction time in the nightside ionosphere to\nthe change at the magnetopause. The optical intensity de-\ncrease between 01:40 UT and 02:40 UT hails the beginning\nof the region of ionospheric scatter observed by the Finland\nHF radar. The region of ionospheric scatter expands quickly\nto cover latitudes from 67\u25e6 N up to 83\u25e6 N, then the pole-\nward edge of it contracts dramatically just before 02:40 UT\nto 76\u25e6 N. The 630.0 nm emission then takes the form of a nar-\nrow band of high intensity, i.e. above 3 kR, which is approxi-\nmately 2\u25e6 wide in latitude at 02:40 UT. The peak intensity of\nthe main emission moves equatorwards from 75\u25e6 N to 71\u25e6 N,\nduring the interval 02:40 UT to 04:20 UT. After this, the peak\nemission moves polewards to 77\u25e6 N, once again becoming\nnarrow, reaching its maximum latitude at 05:40 UT. Above\nthe main latitude of emission there are several equatorward\nmoving features starting at 03:10 UT, 03:45 UT, 03:55 UT\nand 04:00 UT. The first and last of these moves from 76\u25e6 N\nto 73\u25e6 N, while the intermediate features move from 75\u25e6 N to\n73\u25e6 N. The approximate rate of motion is 0.1\u25e6 \u00b1 0.05\u25e6 per\nminute (\u223c 170 m\/s).\nThe 557.7 nm emission, although active simultaneously\nwith the 630.0 nm emission, has a constant poleward edge at\n73\u25e6 with a broader region of high intensity, above 3 kR, and\nvariable structure equatorward of this latitude. The same re-\nduction in luminosity between 01:40 UT and 02:40 UT is ob-\nserved in the 557.7 nm emission, as are the same equatorward\nmoving features from 03:10 UT to 04:00 UT. The peak of the\nof the 557.7 nm emission is located at approximately 72\u25e6 N\nfrom 02:40 UT until 04:10 UT, when it moves southwards to\n70\u25e6 N at 05:00 UT, as the intensity starts to decrease until it is\nbeyond the interval of interest. The equatorward edge of the\nemission is south of the field-of-view from 02:50 UT until\nthe end of the interval.\n3.4 Magnetometer data\nA 150 nT negative bay is observed in the X-component\n(north-south) data from S\u00f8r\u00f8ya (SOR, 67.1\u25e6 N, 106.7\u25e6 E)\n506 E.

This enhanced westward\nelectrojet decays to previous levels by 01:10 UT and is, there-\nfore, assumed to have no effect on the spectral width bound-\nary indicated in Fig. 3a. Data from five of the magnetometers\nof the image chain for the period 01:00 UT to 06:00 UT on\n20 December 1998 are shown in Fig. 6. The magnetome-\nter data have been band pass filtered using a range of 100 s\nto 1000 s. A wave, matching the frequency of the one ob-\nserved by the Hankasalmi radar (\u223c 2 MHz), is recorded by\nmagnetometers of the image chain starting at 02:20 UT. The\namplitude of the wave observed by the magnetometers is\nlargest at the stations of Bear Island (BJN, 71.3\u25e6 N, 108.9\u25e6 E)\nand Hopen Island (HOP, 72.9\u25e6 N, 115.9\u25e6 E). There is a sharp\ndecrease in the amplitude of the wave between HOP and\nLongyearbyen (LYR, 75.0\u25e6 N, 113.0\u25e6 E) and a slower de-\ncrease to the south of HOP. Measurements of the latitudinal\nvariation of the amplitude and phase of the wave area are\nconsistent with the wave being a field line resonance (FLR)\nwith the resonating field line poleward of HOP and equator-\nward of LYR. Since FLRs only occur on closed field lines, a\nlower limit for the OCFLB can be set at 72.9\u25e6 N.\n3.5 Incoherent scatter data\nThe first three panels of Fig. 7 show the electron density,\nelectron temperature and ion velocity, respectively, observed\nby the ESR from 01:00 UT to 06:00 UT.

The ESR UHF beam was pointing in\nthe same vertical plane as beam 9 of CUTLASS Finland, in\nthe opposite sense during this interval, at an elevation of 30\u25e6.\nThe altitude range covered by the data in Fig. 7 is from ap-\nproximately 90 km at 74\u25e6 N to 390 km at 70\u25e6 N. Although\nnot shown here, the data from the EISCAT VHF beams show\nvery similar results to those from the ESR. It is evident from\nFig. 7c and 7d that the line-of-sight ion velocities from the\nincoherent radar agree well with the irregularity drift veloci-\nties observed by CUTLASS Finland. (Note that all the data\nshown have positive velocities towards the HF radar at Fin-\nland and that the range of magnetic latitudes shown is dif-\nferent from Fig. 3). This is consistent with previous results\nthat the phase speed of F-region irregularities is equal to the\ncomponent of the ambient plasma flow in their direction of\npropagation (Davies et al., 2000 and references therein). One\ncan observe the same field line resonance signature as seen\nfrom Hankaslami and the same flow bursts at 03:10 UT and\n03:50 UT.\nEquatorward moving structures are evident in the electron\ndensity and electron temperature data, Fig. 7a and 7b, re-\nspectively, from 03:40 UT to 04:10 UT. These structures are\nobserved by the ESR, while equatorward moving structures\nare also observed by the MSP, although not simultaneously\nand at a lower latitude. The equatorward motion is observed\nat the same time as strong velocity towards Hankaslami, and\nE. E.

The\ncolours indicate the frequency of observations within the bin they\noutline.\nalso in the latter part of the interval when the spectral width\ngradient moves equatorward.\nThe ESR observed two pronounced regions of structured,\nelevated electron temperature in the F-region, Fig. 7b, and\nthis is replicated by the two VHF beams from Troms\u00f8, from\n01:00 UT and 01:45 UT, and 03:10 UT and 04:20 UT, Fig. 7b.\nThe ESR beam is at F-region altitudes below approximately\n73\u25e6 N. These regions are clearly seen to be co-located with\nthe areas of high spectral width observed by CUTLASS Fin-\nland at these times, Fig. 7e. Figure 8 shows a comparison of\nthe electron temperature from the incoherent scatter radars\nand spectral width from the Finland radar in the region 71\u25e6 N\nto 72\u25e6 N, which restricts the altitude range of observation to\na small slice of the F-region around 300 km. This is done for\ntwo reasons: first, to ensure the values are solely from the\nF-region and second, to avoid any effects due to the under-\nlying increase of electron temperature with altitude found in\nthe topside F-region. Panels (a) to (c) of Fig. 8 show scat-\nter plots of electron temperature from the ESR and beams\n1 and 2 of the EISCAT VHF system, respectively, versus co-\nlocated and simultaneous HF scatter spectral width.

The locations of these in-\ntersecting measurements have been chosen within the range 71\u25e6 N\nto 72\u25e6 N, and at an altitude of \u223c 300 km.\nHigh spectral width values measured by CUTLASS Finland\nare collocated with elevated electron temperatures although\nthe reverse is not the case. Figure 9 shows a direct compar-\nison of simultaneous, co-located observations for the ESR\nUHF beam and beams 1 and 2 of the mainland VHF system\n(a to c, respectively) with the HF radar data. The analysis\nfrom both Figs. 8 and 9 shows that although high spectral\nwidths from the HF radar are associated with high electron\ntemperatures, there are also regions of elevated electron tem-\nperature associated with very low spectral width. Also, note\nthat the elevated electron temperature feature is spatially ex-\ntended in longitude as it occurs in all three incoherent scatter\nradar beams.\n4 Discussion\nA previous case study in the pre-midnight sector (Lester et\nal., 2001) concluded that the well-defined gradient between\nlow (< 200 m\/s) and high (> 200 m\/s) spectral width can be\nused, with caution, as an ionospheric proxy for the PCB. This\nconclusion was based on the fact that the gradient would,\nat times, follow the poleward edge of the 630.0 nm optical\n508 E. E. Woodfield et al.: A case study of HF radar spectral width in the post midnight magnetic local time sector\nemission, which has been proposed as a proxy for the PCB\n(Blanchard et al., 1995). Blanchard et al. had established\nthat the poleward edge of the 630.0 nm emission can be used\nas the ionospheric footprint of the PCB with an accuracy of\n\u00b1 0.9\u25e6 in the pre-midnight sector. Lester and colleagues did\nnote that during dynamic intervals, e.g. a weak substorm, the\nrelationship between the spectral width gradient and the pole-\nward border of the red line emission broke down.\nThe poleward boundary of the 630.0 nm emission in this\ninterval is confused by the presence of several equatorward\nmoving arcs poleward of the main region of 630.0 nm emis-\nsion, Fig. 3d. However, the spectral width gradient is gener-\nally significantly equatorward of both the equatorward mov-\ning arcs and the poleward edge of the main region of emis-\nsion. Notably, the spectral width gradient is equatorward of\nthe intense emissions seen at 75\u25e6 N which are not subject to\nerror resulting from assuming an altitude, since all emission\nat this latitude is directly overhead. In general, the motion in\ntime of the location of the gradient does not follow either the\nmain poleward boundary, or the equatorward moving arcs.\nThis could be a result of the altitude structure of the opti-\ncal emission changing with time; nevertheless, the spectral\nwidth gradient stays equatorward of the emission at 0\u25e6 to the\nzenith. Thus, we assume that the non-correspondence of the\nspectral width boundary and poleward edge of the 630.0 nm\nemission is not a result of the assumed altitude applied to the\nobservations of the 630.0 nm emission in order to map it to\nmagnetic latitude. The electrojet activity in the vicinity of\nScandinavia seen at 00:00 UT, prior to the interval discussed\nhere, has been assumed to have no long lasting effect that\nwould affect the alignment of the spectral width gradient and\npoleward edge of the 630.0 nm emission over Scandinavia.\nAlthough the spectral width gradient is, for the most part,\nequatorward of the poleward edge of the 630.0 nm emission,\nthe one exception to this, between 04:30 UT and 05:00 UT, is\ndue to an ambiguity in determining the location of the spec-\ntral width gradient. The difference between this case study\nand that of Lester et al. (2001) could be a result of the dif-\nferent types of precipitation in the pre- and post-midnight\nsectors of MLT, as described by Shue et al. (2001). The ob-\nservations shown in this paper indicate that much of the high\nspectral width region is actually located on closed field lines.\nHence, we conclude that Lester et al. (2001) were correct in\nadvising caution in using the gradient between high and low\nspectral width as a proxy for the PCB. Furthermore, we con-\nclude that in the post-midnight sector the gradient between\nlarge and small spectral width values is exclusively on closed\nfield lines during this case study.\nDuring this interval we have another means of finding the\nminimum latitude for the PCB, namely the field line res-\nonance seen in both the IMAGE magnetometer data and\nthe Finland and EISCAT radar line-of-sight velocity data,\nFig. 6. These observations set a lower limit for the OCFLB\nat 72.9\u25e6 N, since a FLR is expected to occur only on closed\nfield lines. This lower limit for the OCFLB is poleward of\nthe majority of the spectral width gradient\u2019s location, which\nreaches 71\u25e6 N at its lowest point. This would indicate that\nif the gradient is related to a magnetospheric boundary, then\nit is more likely to be an indicator of the boundary between\nthe CPS and PSBL (Lewis et al., 1997; Dudeney et al., 1998)\nsince both of these regions are assumed to be on closed field\nlines.\nThe incoherent scatter radar data from the EISCAT facil-\nities show an interesting effect to consider further. A first\nlook at Fig. 7b and 7e seems to indicate a correspondence\nbetween regions of elevated electron temperature and high\nspectral width. Upon further comparison of the F-region\nelectron temperature data from the EISCAT and ESR data\nwith the spectral width values, we find that regions of high\nspectral width are associated with regions of high electron\ntemperature, but not vice versa. Only data between 71\u25e6 N\nand 72\u25e6 N are used to eliminate the underlying change in\nthe electron temperature with altitude that is present in the\nF-region. This latitude range also restricts both CUTLASS,\nEISCAT and ESR radars to F-region altitudes. If one as-\nsumes that elevated electron temperatures are linked to elec-\ntron precipitation, then there is a relationship here between\nF-region electron precipitation and high spectral widths in\nthe F-region. Following from this interpretation it is possi-\nble that the relationship between elevated electron tempera-\nture and high spectral width on closed field lines is a signa-\nture of small-scale vortex activity resulting from precipita-\ntion. The work of Newell et al. (1996) has characterised the\nchange from structured to unstructured electron precipitation\n(on a scale of > 5\u201310 km) as boundary \u201cb4s\u201d, as observed\nby DMSP satellites. The decrease in correlation between\nsuccessive electron spectra above this boundary means that\nthere are spatial stuctures < 5\u201310 km at the satellite altitude\non closed field lines. These could be the signature of filamen-\ntary electron precipitation which could generate small-scales\nvortices. This case study cannot, however, directly demon-\nstrate this.\n5 Conclusions\nContrary to a previous case study, the boundary between\nlarge and small values of HF radar spectral width for this\ndata set is located exclusively on closed field lines. It follows\nthat the spectral width boundary is not a reliable means of lo-\ncating the ionospheric footprint of the open\/closed field line\nboundary.\nThere is, however, evidence for a relationship between\nhigh spectral width and elevated electron temperature in the\nF-region during this interval, leading us to believe that there\ncould be a link between electron precipitation and high spec-\ntral width. Further data will be looked at to define this re-\nlationship more specifically and determine if low frequency\nwave activity or small-scale vortices are involved in generat-\ning high spectral widths on the nightside.\nAcknowledgement.
