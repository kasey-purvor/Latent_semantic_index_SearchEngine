Aspergillus oryzae and Rhizopus oryzae were\ngrown on rice hulls using different media. Tween 80 and olive oil were employed as main carbon sources; the whole solid cultures\nwere lyophilised and employed in heptane for catalysing the formation of various geranyl esters with molar conversions ranging from\n40 to 95%, under optimised conditions, starting from 50 mM geraniol and equimolar amount of the acid. \nKey words: solid state fermentation, rice hulls, Rhizopus oryzae, Aspergillus oryzae, esterification, flavours.\nINTRODUCTION\nSolid-state fermentation (SSF) is a process occurring in the\nnear-absence of free water employing an inert and\/or nat-\nural solid support for the growth (Pandey et al., 1999). SSF\nmay have considerable advantages over traditional liquid\nfermentations, such as easy aeration, low energy require-\nments, non sterile conditions, higher product yields and\neasier product recovery (Ooijkaas et al., 2000). A lot of\npublished information concerning SSF regards the produc-\ntion of microbial metabolites and industrial enzymes; the\ninterest has been mainly devoted to extracellular enzymes\nwhich are easily recovered and do not undergo major pro-\nteolytic degradation (Pandey et al., 2000).\nMany different fungi have been grown on natural or\nsynthetic impregnated supports, such as vermiculite\n(Silman et al., 1993), clay granules (Desgranges et al.,\n1993), amberlite (Gutierrez-Rojas et al., 1995),\npolyurethane foam (Hongzhang et al., 2006; John et al.,\n2007) or polystyrene (Zhu et al., 1994; Gautam et al.,\n2002). SSF can be carried out also on a variety of agricul-\ntural residues such as wheat straw, bagasse, corn cobs,\nrice hulls (Pandey et al., 2000), babassu cakes (Gutarra et\nal., 2007) and melon wastes (Alkan et al., 2007). Rice hulls\nare cheap waste-products and have been employed for the\ngrowth of Colletotrichum truncatum for use as mycoherbi-\ncide (Silman et al., 1991).\nAspergillus oryzae and Rhizopus oryzae are among the\nmicroorganisms traditionally studied in SSF, such as the\nKoji process or grown on polyurethane foam for the pro-\nduction of extracellular lipases (Cbristen et al., 1995), pro-\nteases (Qzawa et al., 1996) and amylases (Murado et al.,\n1997). We have previously observed that strains of A.\noryzae and R. oryzae produced extracellular and mycelium\nbound carboxylesterases with relevant activities and their\ndry mycelium efficiently and selectively catalysed the ester-\nification between free acetic acid and primary alcohols in\norganic solvent (Molinari et al., 2000; Gandolfi et al.,\n2001). Acetic esters, such as geranyl acetate, are impor-\ntant flavour and fragrance components in the food and cos-\nmetic industry (Longo and Sanroman, 2006).\nIn this work we have studied the growth and lypolitic\nactivity of A. oryzae MIM in SSF employing rice hulls as\nsupport, since the mycelial morphology of these moulds\nseemed to be well suited for growing on solid supports. The\ncarboxylesterase activity of the resulting biocatalyst has\nbeen exploited for the acylation of geraniol in organic sol-\nvent with acetic, butyric and hexanoic acid. The procedure\ndeveloped with A. oryzae MIM was also applied to four\nother microbial strains, belonging to the species R. oryzae\n(namely R. oryzae CBS 112.07, R. oryzae CBS 260.28, R.\noryzae CBS 328.47, R. oryzae CBS 391.34).\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nMicroorganisms. Five microorganisms were used:\nAspergillus oryzae MIM (Microbiologia Industriale Milano)\nand Rhizopus oryzae CBS 112.07T (Centraalbureau voor\nSchimmelcultures, Baarn, the Netherlands), R. oryzae\nCBS 260.28 formerly type of Rhizopus liquefaciens, R.\noryzae CBS 328.47 formerly type of Rhizopus delemar\nand R. oryzae CBS 391.34 formerly type of Rhizopus\njavanicus. They were routinely maintained on a solid\nmedium (malt extract 8 g\/l, agar 15 g\/l, pH 5.5). Rice\nhulls were gently furnished by AIRI (Associazione Italiana\nRisiere Italiane).\n* Corresponding author.

Submerged fermentations (SMF)\nwere carried out in 750 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing\n100 ml of medium and incubated at 28 \u00b0C for 48 h on a\nreciprocal shaker (100 spm). The moulds were grown on\nmedia containing a basal medium (BM: Difco yeast extract\n1 g\/l, K2HPO4 1 g\/l, MgSO4\u00b77H2O 0.2 g\/l, pH 5.8) added\nwith a nitrogen source (peptone, polypeptone, NaNO3 or\n(NH4)2SO4 5 g\/l) and a carbon source (olive oil or Tween\n80, 5-20 g\/l). The flasks were inoculated with 10 ml of\nspore suspension (2 x 106 spores\/ml).\nSolid state fermentations were performed in 20 cm Petri\ndishes. Rice hulls were dried in an air oven at 60 \u00b0C for 48\nh, homogenised and sieved to obtain fractions between 1.0\nand 2.0 mm particle size; 10 g of the obtained rice hulls\nwere impregnated with 13.5 ml of a solution containing:\nDifco yeast extract 1 g\/l, K2HPO4 1 g\/l, MgSO4\u00b77H2O 0.2\ng\/l, pH 5.8, added with a nitrogen source (polypeptone 5\ng\/l). Carbon sources (olive oil or Tween 80) were sepa-\nrately added at 5-20 g\/l after sterilisation; the plates were\nfinally inoculated with 1.5 ml of a spore suspension (2 x 106\nspores\/ml) and incubated at 28 \u00b0C for 48 h; the resulting\nmicrobial cultures were lyophilised. The lyophilised cultures\nwere assayed for esterase activity and employed as biocat-\nalyst in esterification trials. \nEsterification reactions. Geraniol esterification was per-\nformed at 50 \u00b0C under magnetic stirring in 10 ml screw\ncapped test tubes by suspending lyophilised cultures from\nSSF in n-heptane and then adding geraniol (50 mM) and an\nequimolar amount of the free acids. Control reactions with\nlyophilised cells coming from SMF were carried out in the\nsame conditions (see Results and Discussion). All the con-\nversion values shown are averages for three different\nmeasurements (standard deviation, \u03c3 < 5%).\nEsterase activity assays. Esterase activity was assayed\nusing \u03b1-naphtylacetate, \u03b1-naphtylbutyrate and \u03b1-naphtyl-\ncaprylate as substrate, measuring the absorbance (wave-\nlength = 560 nm) relative to the cromophores originated\nby reaction of the hydrolysed substrate with Fast Garnet\nGBS salt (Molinari et al., 2000; Gilham and Lehner, 2005).\nThe mycelia resulting from the SMF growth and the\nlyophilised cultures obtained with SSF were both suspend-\ned in distilled water and homogenised at 4 \u00baC to obtain a\nsuspension suited for the test.\nThe solutions of naphtyl derivatives were prepared by\nadding the substrates (0.42 mM) in 4 ml of ethanol to 96\nml of buffer solution (0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.0) containing\narabic gum (10 mg) and dioctyl sulfosuccinate sodium salt\n(AOT, 200 mg). The reaction mixtures were obtained by\nadding 1.5 ml of the substrate solution to 100 mg of\nlyophilised biocatalyst in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7. The enzy-\nmatic activity was expressed as unit (U), defined as the\namount of biocatalyst which catalysed the transformation\nof 1 \u03bcmole of substrate in 1 minute at 45 \u00baC. \nAnalytical methods. Biomass in submerged and solid\nstate cultures was determined by ergosterol content meas-\nurements (Desgranges et al., 1991). Alcohol and ester con-\ncentrations of the biotransformations in organic solvent\nwere determined by gas-chromatographic (GC) analysis on\na Carlo Erba Fractovap GC equipped with a hydrogen flame\nionization detector. The column (3 x 2000 mm) was packed\nwith Carbowax 1540 (10% on Chromosorb 80-100 mesh).\nThe injector temperature was 200 \u00baC. Samples (0.25 ml)\nwere taken at intervals; cells were separated by centrifu-\ngation (15000 rpm, 5 min) and to the organic phase was\nadded an equal volume of an internal standard solution (1-\noctanol) in n-heptane.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nAspergillus oryzae MIM was preliminarily grown on sub-\nmerged cultures employing media containing different\nnitrogen sources (peptone, polypeptone, NaNO3 or\n(NH4)2SO4) and 0.5% olive oil as main carbon source. The\nuse of 0.5% polypeptone as nitrogen source gave the high-\nest biomass yields; polypeptone was therefore used as\nnitrogen source in all the following trials. \nIt has been previously shown that olive oil and Tween\n80 are among the carbon sources suited for producing\nmycelium of A. oryzae MIM with high lipolytic activity\n(Molinari et al., 2000). Experiments were therefore per-\nformed using solid media containing olive oil and Tween 80\nas main carbon sources using rice hulls as support; sub-\nmerged fermentations were also carried out as comparison.\nThe resulting growth values are reported in Table 1.\nThe activity of the SMF mycelia and the whole SSF cul-\ntures was tested using \u03b1-naphtyl acetate, butyrate and\ncaprylate as current substrates (see figures 1A and 1B).\nThe highest degree of activity was observed in most of\nthe cases with naphtylbutyrate, while the highest activity\ntowards acetate ester was obtained with mycelia grown\nusing 0.5% Tween 80. This approach indicates that the\nenzyme(s) expressed under these conditions can be con-\nsidered as \u201ctrue\u201d esterases (Bornscheuer, 2002).\nThe whole lyophilised SSF cultures and the lyophilised\nmycelium from SMF were used as biocatalyst for the syn-\nthesis of different geranyl esters (acetate, butyrate and\nhexanoate). Figure 2A reports the acylation of geraniol\n(50mM) with equimolar amounts of acetic, butyric and\nhexanoic acid catalysed by 300 g\/l of lyophilised SSF cul-\nture (corresponding to a concentration of dry mycelium\nranging from 5 to 20 g\/l depending on the growth medium)\nsuspended in heptane at 50 \u00baC. Biotransformations per-\nformed with 15 mg\/ml of free lyophilised mycelium are also\nreported for comparison (see figure 2B).\n562 D.

Molar conversions higher than 70% were\nfound in the case geranylbutyrate with lyophilised SSF-cul-\ntures of A. oryzae grown with olive oil or Tween 80 at var-\nious concentrations, while the production of geranylacetate\nand geranylhexanoate was strongly dependent on the car-\nbon source employed; high yields of geranylhexanoate\nwere obtained only using olive oil. Therefore it is likely that\ndifferent enzymes are expressed depending on the type of\nfermentation employed.\nThe good results obtained with A. oryzae led us to\ninvestigate other four microbial strains, belonging to the\nspecies R. oryzae (namely R. oryzae CBS 112.07, R.\noryzae CBS 260.28, R. oryzae CBS 328.47 and R. oryzae\nCBS 391.34). These strains had previously shown very\neffective in promoting the synthesis of esters in organic\nsolvents (Gandolfi et al., 2001). The four strains were\ngrown in SSF using rice hulls as solid support with the\nmedium that afforded the best results with A. oryzae (i.e.\n2% olive oil, polypeptone 5g\/l). A fungal biomass of 51 (\u00b1\n5.0) mg of mycelium per gram of solid support was found. \nFigure 3A reports the acylation of geraniol (50 mM) with\nequimolar amounts of acetic, butyric and hexanoic acid\ncatalysed by 300 g\/l of lyophilised SSF culture (correspon-\nding to about 15 mg\/ml of mycelium) suspended in hep-\ntane at 50 \u00baC. Biotransformations performed with 15\nmg\/ml of free lyophilised mycelium are also reported for\ncomparison (Fig. 3B).\nLyophilised mycelia of R. oryzae grown in SMF furnished\nhigher rates and conversions for acetylation than when\ngrown in SSF. The acylation with butyric acid occurred with\nsimilar results using SMF- or SSF-grown mycelium, while\nthe latter was a better catalyst for geranylhexanoate for-\nmation, being able to yield more than 80% molar conver-\nsion after 24 hours. It is likely that different sets of\nenzymes are expressed under different growth conditions.\nIt should be pointed out that A. oryzae MIM and R. oryzae\nstrains produced also extra-cellular carboxylesterases in\nSMF, while SSF cultures are directly lyophilised without any\ndownstream operation.\nAnn.

The whole procedure\nis very simple and allowed for a stable and efficient cata-\nlyst employable in organic solvents for direct esterification\nof geraniol. \nREFERENCES\nAlkan H., Baysal Z., Uyar F., Dogru M.
