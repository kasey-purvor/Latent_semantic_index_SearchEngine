In both Canada and the United States existing local Wi-Fi \nprojects, both top-down and bottom up, have failed to fulfill expectations that they could \nincrease digital inclusion.  Current policy frameworks may play some role in these \nfailures. This paper argues for a policy approach that favors hybrid public broadband that \nis neither completely bottom-up nor top down, and for the development of policy \nframeworks that support hybrid-public broadband. \n \nKeywords: broadband policy, digital inclusion, community and municipal Wi-Fi, case \nstudies \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nResearch increasingly demonstrates that broadband is becoming central to full \nparticipation in North American civic life, yet broadband adoption rates are dropping in \nboth the US and Canada (Horrigan, 2008; OECD 2008). While the problem has been \nrecognized and addressed by diverse groups, in this paper we specifically focus how on \ngovernmental policy-makers and citizen or community groups have approached it. \nGenerally, these two groups have used either top-down or bottom up approaches to this \nproblem, but individually most of these efforts have failed.  Clearly, there must be an \nalternative to providing local broadband that occupies a middle ground between purely \ntop-down or bottom-up approaches.  New policies should be developed and supported \nthat can enable this type of community broadband development. \nIn this paper we examine three cases of broadband Internet being deployed by \norganizations other than traditional telephone, cable and Internet service providers. \nThese three cases fall both within the United States and Canada, in different policy \nenvironments, but with similar telecommunication agendas. We examine the cases of \nboth municipalities and community groups attempting to provide telecommunications \nservices to citizens to fill gaps left by traditional providers. In all three cases, these \nefforts began with great hopes to use broadband Internet to solve social problems in the \ncommunities and ended with unmet expectations and limited service. While there are \nmany explanations for this lack of success, we offer the argument that unidirectional \napproaches, either top down or bottom up, have limited hopes for success, while \nbidirectional hybrids may promote greater chances of successful deployments, \ncoverage, access and usage, including digital inclusion. \nIn the following sections we define hybrid public broadband and our approach to the \nstudy of public broadband. Next, we offer a discussion of the North American policy \nenvironments in which these public broadband efforts are taking place. Subsequently, \nwe provide data from three cases and end with our analysis and discussion. \n \nHybrid Public Broadband \nIn recent years a rift has opened between researchers who study the social context of \nbroadband networks. The dividing issue seems to be the origin of the network. On the \none side exist community broadband networks that originate in the hands of interested, \nconcerned and technologically able citizen and community groups (Auray, et al, 2003; \nSandvig, 2004; Meinrath, 2001, 2005; Bar & Park, 2006) which have conventionally \n 3 \nbeen opposed to municipally sponsored or owned broadband networks, in which the city \nacts a convener, leader, provider and designer of the network (Tapia & Ortiz, 2007, \n2006; Ortiz & Tapia, 2008; Gillett, 2006).  Community cases have typically been \ncharacterized as bottom-up or grassroots (Gurstein, 2000, 2003) while municipal \nprojects are framed as being as top-down. In some of the earliest case studies, several \nof these networks were often framed as in conflict or opposed to the other form. We \nbelieve this dichotomy to be useful in describing the origins and establishment efforts of \nnetworks, but less useful as networks age and mature. \nWe argue for something called hybrid public broadband. With the  growth in quantity and \nsize of broadband networks, we have seen a marked hybridization in which partnerships \nbetween local governments, industry and community groups redefine ownership, \nmanagement, maintenance and use  (see Tapia & Ortiz 2006 and 2007). The networks \nare not purely municipal, community nor private. Clement and Bryne-Potter call this \nhybrid public broadband, or broadband in the public interest.  They define it as \nbroadband networks that serve the public interest, regardless of the ideology upon which \nthey were founded and the means by which they are provided (Clement & Bryne-Potter, \n2007).  Additionally, Meinrath describes ideal community broadband networks as small \nand locally based, often comprised of non-profits, unincorporated, municipally supported, \nhybrid partnerships, usually constructed from off the shelf hardware, action and results \noriented and possessing a mission to support both social and economic development \n(Meinrath, 2005).  \nThe research questions that drive this paper are;  \n(1) Why does current media policy lead to failure of both municipal and community \nnetworks? \n(2) What kind of broadband network would be successful? \n(3) What might a hybrid public broadband network look like? \n(4) What kind of media policy would support the construction of such a network? \n \nIn the following section, we identify our overall approach to the study of broadband and \nprovide a comparative policy context in which we will situate our cases. \n \nOur Approach to the Study of Broadband \nBroadband is not a luxury. Broadband is an essential component of the national \ninfrastructure of North America. Citizens who have access to and the skills to use the \nInternet are (1) more successful economically, with respect to education, jobs and \nearnings, (2) socially participate more in terms of political and civic engagement, (3) and \nreceive more government services and other public goods than those who do not. (Katz \n& Rice, 2002; Kennard, 2001; Oden, 2004; Oden & Strover, 2002; Tufekcioglu, 2003; \nServon, 2002). \n \nMunicipalities and community groups have fundamentally different goals in providing \nbroadband Internet access than private industry. While community groups may be \ninterested in promoting civic engagement or cultural capital among members of specific \ngroups (Cho, 2006), municipalities are interested in promoting civic engagement, social \ninclusion, and economic development across all neighborhoods and communities \nthrough the deployment of their broadband network. Private industry must be concerned \nwith the bottom line and provides service with a mind towards profits rather than social \nwelfare. Traditionally, the US has relied on private industry and competition to achieve \ngreater quality and efficiency in the provision of Internet services (Lehr & Sirbu, 2004). \n 4 \nHowever, this approach is not working: the US and Canada are falling behind the rest of \nthe world in terms of their broadband rollouts and average speed and quality of service. \nIn addition, significant portions of inner cities and rural areas remain without service and \nthe price of the service offered continues to rise. US broadband penetration growth \ndropped from 15th to 17th place worldwide, from June 2007 to December 2007  (OECD, \n2008) Canada was ranked 18th, just behind the US according to the same data. Most of \nthese measures rely on the marketplace to address the nation\u2019s need for broadband \nconnectivity. \n \nThe United States has recognized the importance of broadband and has adopted a \nvariety of measures to promote broadband. In the US policies concerned with universal \naccess to telecommunication services exist at the federal, state, and local levels.  Such \nefforts follow a long tradition of \u201cuniversal service\u201d programs that attempt to provide low \ncost telecommunication services both to low income persons and those living in areas \nwhere it is costly to provide such services, namely, rural areas (Schement & Forbes, \n1999).  At the federal level, Internet access is subsidized to certain schools, classrooms, \nhealth care providers, and libraries through the universal service fund, which is \nadministered by the Federal-State Universal Service Joint Board (Prieger, 1998).  \nAdditional efforts at the state levels include programs to improve the benefits of Internet \naccess (see Strover et al., 2004) and tax incentives for fixed line operators to deploy \nbroadband \u201clast mile\u201d networks.  However, together these efforts have been insufficient \nto guarantee ubiquitous low-cost broadband access.  \n \nCanada made an early commitment to developing universal access to broadband \nthrough its National Broadband Strategy, launched in 1995.  This strategy provided \nincentives to companies to develop broadband services in areas of the country that had \nnot been well served by the broadband market.  This was followed by the Broadband for \nRural and Northern Development (BRAND) program in 2001.  These initiatives were \nboth part of the government\u2019s Connecting Canadians policy agenda, directed at making \nCanada \u201cthe most connected nation in the world\u201d (National Broadband Task Force, \n2002).  This agenda provided incentives for broadband and Internet network \ndevelopments, and supported numerous public connectivity programs, such as \nSchoolNet, VolNet, and LibraryNet (dedicated to providing connectivity in all of the \ncountry\u2019s schools, volunteer organizations, and libraries) that expanded free, community-\nbased public access locations as well as encouraging market aggregation for rural and \nremote areas of the country.  \n \nThe BRAND program was meant to help in \u201cmeeting the Government of Canada\u2019s \ncommitment to bring broadband technology to all Canadian communities\u201d (National \nBroadband Task Force, 2002).  While these programs n were not entirely successful in \nproviding equivalent broadband service in all areas of Canada (the BRAND program in \nparticular was criticized as a weak response to the Task Force recommendations) they \nhave provided very good broadband connectivity at reasonable prices to subscribers in \nmost urban regions of Canada  by encouraging competition in local broadband provision. \n \nCurrently, the lack of fair distribution of broadband has resurfaced as a public policy \nissue1.  Canada was once a leader in broadband provision, but the shortsighted design \nof the 1990s policies meant that many providers pulled out of less financially viable \nregions once government subsidies were no longer available.  In addition, funding for \n                                                \n1  See the website for the Internet for Everyone campaign:  http:\/\/www.internetforeveryone.ca \n 5 \nprojects which supported education and digital inclusion projects were cut. With the \nelimination of funding for these projects and the reality of market failure for broadband in \nmany areas (Longford & Shade, 2007), Canadians in rural and low-income areas may \nhave difficulty accessing broadband, and will likely not receive education and training on \nhow to best use high-speed internet, which as we argue below is part of a policy \nenvironment that could better support hybrid-public broadband. \n \nCurrent State of Local Broadband Policy \n \nIn the US, policy addressing telecommunications services provided by local \nmunicipalities has been in a state of flux at both the state and federal levels. \nApproximately one third of U.S. States have initiated some form of broadband-related \npolicy that proposes to regulate the role a municipality might play in offering broadband \nservices, although these differ wildly. In addition, several federal bills have been \nproposed that also address municipal involvement, yet as of 2008, none have passed \n(Tapia & Ortiz 2007, Tapia & Ortiz 2006).  \n \nThe central goal of most policy that supports municipal entry into the telecommunication \narena is to deliver high-quality broadband service to all citizens at a reasonable price. \nThe argument is that the incumbent providers do not offer ubiquitous service because it \nis not cost effective in some areas. Those who oppose municipal entry do so with the \nbelief that municipalities possess unfair advantages and incumbents would not complete \nupon a level playing field. Additionally, it is argued that municipalities may not posses the \norganizational competencies to deploy and manage the network without jeopardizing \ntaxpayer dollars and assets.  \n \nFueled by strong objections of incumbent telecommunication providers, state \nlegislatures have been the locus of policy regarding municipal broadband. The central \nargument on the part of those lobbying state legislatures is that the public funding and \nsupport of municipal broadband networks unfairly impacts competition in municipal \nmarkets between traditional private telecommunications providers and new ventures \nfunded in part with public tax funds (Tapia, Maitland and Stone, 2006; Stone, Maitland \nand Tapia, 2005). These private providers have expressed concern that cities providing \nwireless broadband service have several advantages. These include an unlimited base \nfrom which to raise capital; the ability to regulate local rights of way and tower permits; \nexisting public infrastructure that is necessary for network deployments including \nstreetlights; and status as tax-exempt organizations. Many companies have sought \nlegislative relief at the state level to regulate or restrict a municipality\u2019s ability to provide \nwireless broadband services to the public.  These legislative initiatives made use of a \nvariety of tools that aim to ensure that a majority of local residents are behind the \ninitiative; the broadband project will not negatively affect a city\u2019s finances, and the \nbroadband deployment does not compete, or competes on a level playing field, with \nprivate carriers. \n \n \n \nInterestingly, the number of new US municipalities who are entering as \ntelecommunications providers is dropping and many more municipal projects have been \nabandoned or failed. In 2007 many small municipalities abandoned their projects and \nseveral large-scale projects (San Francisco and Chicago) ending their development \nefforts very publicly. As of late August, 2007, Earthlink looks to be retreating from the \n 6 \nmunicipal broadband market (Panettieri, 2007), Chicago is delaying its network \ndevelopment (Ellison, 2007a), and the proposed development for San Francisco remains \nstalled (Letzing, 2007).  \n \nGiven the different broadband environment in Canada, local broadband projects came in \nthe form of Wi-Fi projects.  In 2004-2005, many major cities announced plans   for entire \nmunicipalities to be covered with WiFi.  Open competition in local broadband markets \nmade it possible for municipalities (such as Fredericton, discussed below) and for \nprovincial government organizations (like the province of Saskatchewan, which provided \nfree Wi-Fi in the downtown areas of its three largest cities) to own Wi-Fi networks and to \nprovide access for free.  \n \nCommunity organizations and grassroots groups of volunteers also created Wi-Fi \nnetworks in Canada.  In addition to Montreal\u2019s \u00cele Sans Fil discussed below, other major \ncities hosted Wi-Fi groups, each of which linked Wi-Fi development to specific social or \npolitical goals such as increased civic participation (Cho, 2006) or individual engagement \nin expanding broadband access to underserved areas (Powell, 2006). \n \nWhile Canada\u2019s early advances in broadband policy foregrounded digital inclusion and \neducation, the current government has advocated for greater deregulation of broadband, \nalthough governments are still allowed to act as local carriers.  The shift away from a \npolicy focus on digital inclusion may also have inspired bottom-up efforts to involve \u201cWi-\nFi geeks\u201d in building community-based networks as a form of civic participation, a \npractice which is beneficial for participants but not necessarily for the broader local \ncommunity (Powell, 2007, 2006). \n \nIn the following section we provide data from three case studies in which we see \nbroadband network failures and the policies, which may be partially responsible for those \nfailures. \n \nRESEARCH DESIGN \n \nIn this section we provide data from three case studies; (1) Portland Oregon, USA, (2) \nThe \u00cele Sans Fil community Wi-Fi network in Montreal, Quebec, Canada and (3) \nFredericton, New Brunswick, Canada. We provide these case studies as examples of \ntop down and bottom-up networks that have not met their own expectations.  \n \nWe will use comparative case studies in this research. The selection of case study as a \nmethodology for conducting this research is appropriate for three reasons. One, case \nstudies have been identified as an appropriate and important tool for the study of \ninformation and communications technologies in organizational contexts (Darke et al., \n1998). Two, the case study is viable method for studying areas that are underdeveloped \nin the literature (Benbasat et al., 1987). Three, the case study method is particularly well \nsuited for studying phenomena that cannot easily be distinguished from its context. \n \nFor each case study we have collected multiple forms of evidence from multiple sources \n(Flyvbjerg, 2006; Jick, 1979). These sources included city documentation, archival \nrecords, and interviews. Documentation included items such as policy handbooks, usage \nstatistics, design documents, and data schemas. Archival records such as meeting \nminutes, contracts and change-logs were collected for tracking the evolution of the \nsystem. Interviews were both structured and semi-structured (Berg, 1989). The interview \n 7 \nguide contained several categories \u2013 basic access, expectations, general technical \nknowledge, usage behaviors, and general perceptions of municipal and community \nnetworks.  \n \nThe above method yielded a wealth of data. Using analytical induction as a backdrop the \ndata analysis consisted of digitally recorded and transcribed interview data. The \ndocuments were analyzed and coded for emergent themes.  These themes were \nclassified into categories.   \n \nBelow each of the three cases is introduced. Next we present the intentions of the \nnetwork, a discussion of the failure of the network and finally a discussion of how policy \nplayed a role in this failure. \n \nUNITED STATES CASE:  Portland, Oregon USA \n \nLike hundreds of other U.S. cities, Portland deployed a broadband network. The \nPortland broadband network went live in early December 2006, with over 70 access \npoints, covering much of the downtown area. The stated goals of this Wi-Fi project were \nto increase digital inclusion and promote economic development. \n \nMetroFi was Portland\u2019s private contractor of free broadband Internet access. The \ncompany signed a public-private agreement with the city to design, build, and operate a \nWi-Fi networks for residents, visitors, and city workers. Metro-Fi provided broadband \naccess to Portland residents in two ways. For $19.95 per month, some users received \nspeeds of 1Mbps with a 256Kbps upload channel without advertising, and others got a \nfree version of the service by accepting advertising. Since its launch, Metro-Fi \nannounced in late 2007 that its network had 19,900 registered users. Portland\u2019s Wi-Fi \nproject was terminated in June of 2008 in that the free, ad-supported, wireless network \nran by Metro-Fi was shut down due to financial problems. One could argue that the \nproject in Portland failed because it became too costly and did not make a profit. \nHowever, those are Metro-Fi\u2019s goals, not the goals of the city. Metro-Fi failed to make a \nprofit, so it pulled out of the project. Because it pulled out, the city\u2019s network failed. The \nsource of the failure was the partnership and reliance with Metro-Fi. \n \nThe failure of Portland\u2019s network can be credited to several factors: a) the lack of federal, \nstate and local policies, b) the city\u2019s top-down approach, and c) Portland\u2019s poor link with \nits community. \n \nIn the years 2003 and then again in 2005 Oregon attempted to pass Oregon House Bill \n2445, which would have severely restricted any Oregon municipalities\u2019 ability to own or \nmanage a network. This bill would have required municipalities to publish a cost-benefit \nanalysis done over an unrealistic three-year time frame and then obtain a majority vote \nin a referendum before providing any communications services or facilities. The bill died \nin committee.  \n \nDespite the fact that Oregon currently has no functional legislation restricting municipal \nprovision of broadband networks, we argue that three factors have encouraged Portland \nto act as if it were operating under such legislation. First, the legislation is likely to be \nproposed again, as has been threatened by current legislators. Second, similar \nlegislation has already been passed in a majority of surrounding states. Third, there is a \nflurry of activity at the federal level seeking to restrict municipal entry into the market. \n 8 \n \nThe single strongest effect of state-level legislation on the choice municipalities make \nconcerning entering the telecommunication market, is a change in business plan so that \nthe municipality would not be the sole owner of the network (see Tapia and Ortiz, 2006 \nand 2007).  For those municipalities located within a state, which has passed restrictive \nlegislation, this legislation serves as the sufficient driver to push the municipality into a \npartnership with private telecom providers. We believe that legislation enacted in one \njurisdiction may have power to influence the behavior of organizations in other \njurisdictions even though there is no legal requirement to do so. Fundamental to this is \nthe fact that municipalities in all states, regardless of the status of state and federal \nlegislation, have incorporated accommodations in their development of municipal \nnetworks (Tapia & Ortiz, 2007).  \n \nWe suggest that a Portland may perceive the need to keep up with potential state or \nnational policy developments. High levels of federal activity may act as a signal to these \nmunicipalities that future legislation concerning municipal roles in telecommunications \nprovision will be determined at the federal level rather than at the state level. \nMunicipalities, like Portland, who have created networks managed via public-private \npartnerships may be preemptively transferring ownership or sole ownership of the \nnetwork in anticipation of future mandates to do so. As a result, Portland was forced into \na defensive posture and a now-defunct partnership with Metro-Fi.   \n \nAnother possible reason for the failure of Portland\u2019s network was because of it was too \ntop-down.  The city made unrealistic claims and promises on which it failed to deliver. \nThe rhetoric surrounding the city of Portland\u2019s network were that the building of the \nnetwork would solve many social problems, including digital inclusion problems, \neconomic problems, and educational problems. However, the mechanism to solve these \nsocial problems was through offering access alone. This technological solution to a \nsocial problem met with misunderstandings and mistrust among the citizens of Portland. \nThe citizens wanted social and educational programs that would draw them out of \npoverty that might incorporate technical elements. This was not what the city offered. \n \nStill along these lines, the city failed to establish partnerships and relationships with local \norganizations engaged both in social support and technical support. When Portland \nannounced its Wi-Fi plans, the city was contacted by different groups stating they were \ninterested in supporting the program and officially partnering with the city.  However, \nseveral years into the project the city still had not formed many partnerships with \ncommunity groups or non-profits. A respondent from a Portland community-based \norganization stated in regard to the network project, \u201cI personally don\u2019t see the city of \nPortland partnering or making an effort to partner with [omitted], or other organizations \nlike [omitted].\u201d  Another subject echoed this by stating, \u201cCategorically-speaking, I don\u2019t \nsee the city pursuing any formal partnerships to ensure the success of the network.  It \nactually refuses to engage in any kind of collaborative process.  It\u2019s just not a priority.\u201d  \nThe city failed was due to its poor link with the community. Portland did a poor job of \nincorporating the local community and its needs into its plans for the municipal \nbroadband network. Local community members interviewed in Portland revealed that \ntheir public officials \u201cdid not utilize local human capital,\u201d or that they felt like \u201cthe voice on \nthe outside shouting in.\u201d \n \nIn sum, both the lack of state-local policy and the looming threat of future federal policies \ncan be attributed to Portland\u2019s failed municipal Wi-Fi attempt.  It forced the city into a \n 9 \ncomplex and weird business partnership with Metro-Fi that often worked against their \ngoals and best interests of the city. Although the city wanted to address the digital divide \nand poverty initially with their network, the for-profit nature of Metro-Fi\u2019s business model \nforced the city to re-think about the money-making goals of the network \u2014something \ncontrary to their non-profit, community goals, their municipal mission, or their original \nintentions of building the network in the first place. This conflict may have contributed to \nPortland\u2019s failure. Most importantly, this case study reveals that advances in municipal \nbroadband reform such as key partnerships, diversity of approaches, human and \nfinancial resources and the integration of policy will improve the success rate of such \ndeployments. \n \nIn the following section we examine two Canadian cases, one a community network and \nanother a municipal network. These cases take place within a different policy \nenvironment but respond to their respective environments similarly further supporting our \nargument that media policy has the potential to limit broadband projects, and also, in \nsome cases, to provide support for some of the characteristics of true hybrid-public \nbroadband. \n \nCANADIAN CASES: Community and Municipality \n \nIn Canada, two cases illustrate the problems with defining networks as either \u201cbottom-\nup\u201d or \u201ctop-down\u201d and also suggest how more flexible policies that give cities more \ncontrol over telecommunications can lead to the development of hybrid-public networks.  \nThese cases were both very early experiments with community Wi-Fi, and each inspired \nsubsequent projects, making them exemplary of a key phase of local broadband \ndevelopment.  The data used in these two case studies was collected by the second \nauthor as part of a larger project on community and municipal Wi-Fi networking (see \nPowell, 2008). The multi-method study, conducted over two years in Montreal and over \nseveral months in Fredericton, included interviews with stakeholders including network \ndevelopers, collaborators, business owners and local government officials (fifteen \ninterviews at each case study site) as well as an analysis of relevant documents.  Each \nwere accompanied by observation of the uses of the networks and informal interviews \nwith network users.   \n \nThe \u00cele Sans Fil community Wi-Fi network in Montreal, Quebec demonstrates how \nlimited resources and unstable organizational forms can limit the development of a \n\u201cbottom-up\u201d network.  The case presents how these limits may be transcended through a \npartnership currently in process between the community group that launched and \ncurrently manages the network, and the municipal government.  The second case also \ndemonstrates how purely top-down organization is not as effective as a hybrid approach.  \nThe small city of Fredericton, New Brunswick created a Wi-Fi network as an extension of \na municipally-owned fiber broadband backbone.  The Wi-Fi network was not intended to \nfulfil any specific social goals, but was simply offered free of charge in public areas, \nusing excess bandwidth from the city\u2019s fibre network.  This case reiterates that a \nbroadband network, even if it is offered by the municipality itself and not through a \nfranchise agreement, is not a priori an adequate response to bridging the digital divide or \ncreating digital inclusion (DiMaggio et al, 2004; DiMaggio & Hargittai, 2002).  The \nanalysis of these cases ends with a series of examples that focus on the potential for \nhybrid-public models to develop in Canada. \n \n \n 1\n0 \n\u00cele Sans Fil (ISF) \n \n\u00cele Sans Fil (in English, Wireless Island) was begun by three university students in 2003, \nwho were frustrated with the lack of access to Wi-Fi in public places in Montreal.   They \nestablished a volunteer-based, non-profit organization that developed its own Wi-Fi \nsoftware, installed Wi-Fi hotspots in caf\u00e9s, bars, and parks, and created location-based \narts and media content for presentation on the splash pages visible at each hotspot. \n \nFrom 2004 to 2007, approximately 100 volunteers contributed to developing ISF\u2019s \nsoftware, to installing 150 access points, and to developing art projects that would \nillustrate the potential for Wi-Fi hotspots to be used as ways of distributing location-\nbased information or to host location-specific applications. ISF members created a non-\nprofit business model for  hotspots, offering businesses and community organizations a \nWi-Fi system at wholesale cost, plus a fifty-dollar annual donation (see \u00cele Sans Fil, 2007 \nfor details).  In exchange, the organizations signed a \u201csocial contract\u201d guaranteeing that \nthey would not charge end users for the Wi-Fi connection.  Since Montreal had not been \nwell served by commercial Wi-Fi providers, this offer was compelling for many \nindependent cafes, bars, and community organizations who wanted to offer Wi-Fi to their \nvisitors, or who wished to cut costs by sharing internet connections wirelessly.  \n \nThe group\u2019s vision statement reads: \u201cWe believe that technology can be used to bring \npeople together and foster a sense of community. In pursuit of that goal, \u00cele Sans Fil \nuses it's [sic] free public access points to promote interaction between users, show new \nmedia art, and provide geographically- and community-relevant information\u201d (Ile Sans \nFil, 2007).  In pursuit of this vision, ISF\u2019s network of over 150 Wi-Fi hotspots provides \nWi-Fi in locations that are open to the public (though not, strictly speaking, public) \nincluding parks, caf\u00e9s, bars, restaurants, artist and community centres, and the public \nareas of some hospitals and academic institutions. The idea of using Wi-Fi as an \nelectronic \u201cthird space\u201d away from work and home (Oldenburg, 1989) has been central \nto ISF\u2019s vision: one volunteer compared Wi-Fi hotspots to public parks: \u201cI\u2019m most excited \nabout is the idea that ISF is building soccer fields. This is my new favorite way of \nexplaining a major thing that I think is important about ISF . . . I loved hearing the \nexample of the soccerfield and having the idea legitimized of providing platforms that \nwere not explicitly geared towards this or that agenda but that strengthened community\u201d \n(Lenczner, 2005). \n \n \n \nMembers of the group also envisioned ways that the Wi-Fi hotspots would provide \nservice to a broader public; they discussed how the portal page could act as a form of \n\u201calternative press\u201d that would help people get to know their neighborhoods better: \u201cit \ncould be very simple:  in each neighborhood, with each cafe we could go around and \nfind one interesting person . . . take a picture and help people get to know someone.  It \ncould be very interesting.  Did you know that your taxi driver was a brain surgeon in Iran \nbefore he had to flee . . .?\u201d  (Interview, Daniel Drouet, February 15, 2005).  These ways \nof thinking about ISF\u2019s contribution focused on the potential of the network to transform \nthe city by acting as a new platform of civic engagement. \n \nBy 2007, ISF had developed a robust network of hotspots, but the location-based art and \ncontent projects never developed as initially planned. Economically, ISF has virtually \neliminated the market for pay-for-use Wi-Fi in public spaces in Montreal:  \u201cwe have done \n 1\n1 \na great job of domesticating free Wi-Fi in Montreal\u201d (Michael Lenczner, personal \ncommunication November 17 2007).  However, the media attention that the group \nattracted because of its grassroots, volunteer orientation raised its profile, and inspired \nthe municipal economic development office to propose a partnership with ISF, beginning \nin 2008. However, the proposed partnership between ISF and the city of Montreal will \nnot create a ubiquitous broadband network throughout the city.  Instead, it will provide \nfunding for a full-time employee to manage ISF\u2019s volunteers, in return for an expansion \nof the network to eventually include 400 hotspots, some of them in city parks and public \nsquares.  A municipal representative explained that he felt that the partnership  \nstructure should support, not replace, what he saw as a fragile organizational form that  \nwas unique to Montreal (Bill Tierney, personal communication Nov. 18, 2007).   \n \nThis type of partnership, where the organizational resources of the municipality leverage \nparticipation by volunteers, may serve as a type of hybrid-public network, although the \nmodel adopted in Montreal does not provide home connectivity. For another response to \na policy environment that suggests the limits of top-down planning, we can examine the \ncase of the small city of Fredericton, New Brunswick.  \n \nFred-eZone, Fredericton, New Brunswick \n \nIn 1999, the city of Fredericton, the provincial capital of New Brunswick created its own \nutility telecommunications company and built a substantial fiber network operated as a \nco-operative with other local partners.  The reason for constructing this infrastructure \nwas that the city of 50,000 people, despite its status as provincial capital and its \ndevelopment as a regional center for knowledge industries, had been bypassed by many \nbroadband service providers, making it very expensive for small businesses to connect \nto the Internet. Until 2001 only one Internet service provider (ISP)served the city. \nBroadband connectivity was only available in certain areas.  The cost of bandwidth was \nat least twice as expensive as in major centers: some businesses paid $800 a month for \ndedicated broadband lines. The market was small enough that large providers did not \nwant to sell in it.  and one small operator even went bankrupt.  In response, the \nmunicipal government's technology department, which had been laying fiber to connect \nits own city offices to a local area network, created the Fredericton Community Network, \na consortium of local businesses including the city government, who partnered to buy \nwholesale bandwidth delivered over infrastructure owned by a non-profit, city owned \ncompany. The company obtained a license as a non-dominant telecommunications \noperatori and  began operating as an ISP.  As the city's CIO explained: \n \nThis was not something they [the telcos] wanted us to do. They tried to \ndissuade our councillors, our managers, that we shouldn\u2019t be doing this that this \nwas unfairly competitive . . .  But we had done our research, we knew what the \nprice points were, we knew what the price points could be.  We knew that there \nwas a fairly predictable pattern of objections from the telcos .  (Maurice Gallant \nInterview Feb 18, 2007) \n \nThe fiber \u201cCommunity Network\u201d, allowed the municipal government and other local \nbusinesses to aggregate their demand for bandwidth.  This lowered the costs for \nbusinesses significantly, and also incited other ISPs to provide connectivity in more \nareas of the city as a means of achieving greater market share.  As a result, more areas \nof the city received broadband connectivity from either the municipal non-profit, the \nincumbent,, or by other providers at market price.   \n 1\n2 \n \nThis municipal intervention was intended to bridge a local digital divide by providing \nconnectivity service that would otherwise not be available.  It also inspired the city to \noffer a free Wi-Fi network using the excess bandwidth available on the fiber network.  \nThis Wi-Fi network, which began operating in 2004, was one of the first in North \nAmerica, and consists of a combination of hotspots, hotzones, and point-to-multipoint \ntransmission to cover certain areas.   \n \nThe success of the Fred-eZone Wi-Fi network depends on the fact that the city \npurchases trunk line connections to the main internet traffic routes at wholesale cost, \nusing the bandwidth not devoted to connecting its offices as a free \u201cgift\u201d to its citizens. \nThrough its operation of the municipal fiber network and the offer of free Wi-Fi in public \nand municipally-owned locations, Fredericton has integrated \u201ccommunity Wi-Fi\u201d into \nmunicipal government and economic development institutions.  The network is managed \nby city employees, and is used to promote the city\u2019s tourism industry, as it primarily \ncovers public areas in the downtown core and selected municipal sites.  The city's mayor \nstates, \u201c I don\u2019t really look at it as something that is economically beneficial and creating \na revenue but more providing a service, a service that is beneficial\u201d (Interview, Brad \nWoodside, Feb 10, 12007). \n \nDespite the fact that it has created hotzones across 40% of its city\u2019s territory, and that \nhundreds of people use the free Wi-Fi service daily, Fredericton\u2019s network has also \nfailed to expand.  In addition, the municipally-provided Wi-Fi has not increased the levels \nof Internet access for individual citizens and residences, despite the fact that it draws on \nmunicipal infrastructure that has contributed to lowering business costs by providing a \ncompetitor in the fibre arena.  Fredericton\u2019s residential broadband continues to be \nprovided by the ILEC, and the Wi-Fi network remains limited to the downtown business \ncorridor.  According to the network operators, most users of the Fredericton network \nconnect three times or fewer, suggesting that the network is mostly used by visitors and \noccasional users rather than as a reliable source of primary Internet connectivity. \n \nDISCUSSION \n \nIn all three of these cases the organizers and sponsors of these networks did not \nsuccessfully achieve their goals. These failures are all complex, multi-dimensional and \nstill remain largely unexplained, however we argue that telecommunication and media \npolicy played a large role in their limited success.  \n \nRegarding the case of Portland, Oregon, the perceived restrictive state level policy and \nthe perceived impending federal policy contributed to the project\u2019s failure. Municipalities, \nlike Portland, who have created networks managed via public-private partnerships may \nbe preemptively transferring ownership or sole ownership of the network in anticipation \nof future mandates to do so. This acts as a form of perceived or indirect policy coercion \nin that while there exists no current regulation of the municipal telecom space these \nmunicipalities anticipate there will be. To protect their investment of capital, rights of way \nand tax dollars, these municipalities are hedging their bets. As we have seen with \nPortland, the result of the partnership brought about conflicting goals between \nmunicipality and their Internet Service Provider partner, leading to the eventual failure of \nthe network. Most importantly, this case provides evidence that the policies in question \nencourage a flawed top-down model. Portland's project suffered first because of its \nforced partnership,and also because of its poor efforts to include  the public in its plans \n 1\n3 \nand choices. The potential hybrid-public model suggested by the Portland case would: i) \nbuild awareness and understanding of the potential impact of ICT for development; ii) \nencourage governments should take ownership of the policy reform process at the local \nlevel; iii) include multi-stakeholder collaboration (government, private, public, etc.); iv) \nseek active participation of at-risk groups in the community; and v) be flexible to adapt to \nlocal needs.  \n \nThe failures of the initial hopes for the Canadian case studies also indicate the gaps in \nexisting broadband policy.  \u00cele Sans Fil, for example, never managed to introduce a new \ncommunity media form using Wi-Fi, although the project forced the development of a \nnew economic model by reducing people\u2019s willingness to pay for Wi-Fi in public places.  \nSimilarly, the Fred-eZone provided Wi-Fi for free in some public places, symbolically \nestablishing its community as innovative, but did not provide comprehensive challenges \nto the existing models for broadband delivery in Fredericton, meaning that broadband \nsavings at the municipal government level were not passed on to households. These \noutcomes suggest that purely bottom-up or top-down community Wi-Fi projects may not \npresent commanding alternatives to current structures of communications ownership.  \nInstead, hybrid forms may provide better alternatives, as suggested by some hybrid \ninstitutional forms developing in Canada. \n \nCurrently, a new set of local Wi-Fi networking projects are establishing institutional \nframeworks that integrate local\u2014and sometimes community \u2014 ownership and \nmanagement with local culture. These models provide the ability to support local \ncommunity organizations, providing alternatives to the franchise models used in \nmunicipal networking.  Failed municipal partnerships in the United States have provoked \ndiscussions of municipal-community partnerships:  For example, the collapse of the \nmunicipal Wi-Fi market in 2008 in Portland led Metro-Fi to announce that it was planning \nto dismantle and sell the components of the network.  In response, the City Controller\u2019s \nchief of staff reported that \u201cfuture investments by the City in wireless provisions will be \nmore project based partnering with local non-profits such as PersonalTelco, One \nEconomy, and Free Geek [all volunteer-based CWNs]\u201d (Churchill, 2007). This kind of \npartnership, like the ISF partnership with the Montreal government, could help Portland \nrecover from MetroFi\u2019s failure to complete its network. \n \nIn Canada and especially in Quebec, the new institutional form of the public-community \npartnership has been successfully adopted as a means of easily and inexpensively \ndeveloping local communications infrastructure. Between 2006 and 2008, Quebec City, \nSherbrooke, Drummondville and the Mont\u00e9regie region of Quebec all began Wi-Fi \nprojects, adopting the ISF model of hotspots sponsored by businesses and community \norganizations.  Quebec City\u2019s \u201cWi-Fi geeks\u2019 branded their hotspot project \u201cZone d\u2019acc\u00e8s \npublique\u201d (public access zone) or ZAP, which helped them to leverage funding from \ngovernment and other sources.   In Sherbrooke, the P\u00f4le Universitaire, a strategic \nalliance between the area\u2019s post-secondary institutions, applied for funding from \nInnovation et Exportation du Qu\u00e9bec, and received $70,000 to build a network of 150 \nhotspots which was completed in January 2008ii.  Plans are for a further expansion: the \nproject began with hotspots at universities and then expanded to commercial properties \nthrough a partnership with the Chamber of Commerce, and the final pillar of \ndevelopment aims to connect more hotspots within the community sector.  The project \nadopted ISF\u2019s hardware and developed the ZAP brand in the local context. Although \nZAP Sherbrooke has no employees, it does not use volunteers to install or maintain the \nnetwork, instead contracting out to local companies.  Volunteers participate in cold \n 1\n4 \ncalling businesses and distributing promotional materials.  \n \nZAP Sherbrooke leverages its strategic alliances to integrate Wi-Fi in various social \nservice contexts.  Over one third of ZAP sites are in universities, libraries, or community \ncenters where connectivity is supported by the City of Sherbrooke.  Bruno Lacasse, one \nof the members of the P\u00f4le Universitaire in Sherbrooke, remarks that the ZAP model for \nproviding \u201csecondary\u201d internet access is \u201cthe best of both worlds\u201d because it provides \ninexpensive Wi-Fi to universities and community organizations, and establishes a non-\nprofit model that could become the basis for a future co-operative telecommunications \noperator managed by the municipal government and the P\u00f4le Universitaire.  ZAP \nSherbrooke brings together the organizational model of ISF with some of the frameworks \nfor public ownership developed in Fredericton. \n \nSome academics and researchers assert that a mix of bottom-up and top-down \napproaches are more suitable for the successful implementation of a municipal \nsponsored project (Gurstein, 2003; Orlikowski & Robey, 1991). To them, a bottom-up \nview should be incorporated into the top-down approach.  The bottom-up model \nassumes that technology is not determined by governments or telecom providers, but is \nnegotiated by all stakeholders in the community. A bottom-up advocate would argue that \nmunicipal sponsored networks should be adjusted to public requirements (i.e. content \nand context), not the other way around. \n \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n \nThese examples illustrate that a more flexible approach to both organization and \nregulation of local networks may be the key to promoting hybrid-public networks.  \nPermitting public or non-profit ownership of infrastructure, such as was possible for \nFredericton, may make the partnerships explored above easier to sustain.  They may \nalso help to increase competition and to provide coverage in areas where market failure \nmeans that ILECs do not provide service.   \n \nThese developments establish some of the elements that we believe characterize a \npublic hybrid network.  Ideally, a public hybrid would have these elements: \n \n1. Digital inclusion strategies, frameworks, programs, activities and solutions \ndeveloped with community organizations and promoted by local government \nofficials; \n2. It would draw on community capacity such as citizen community groups, \neducational institutions (public-private or public-community partnerships), health \ncare institutions, non-profit and non-government organizations, community and \ncomputer technology centers, local chambers of commerce, small businesses, as \nwell as the advocacy and public policy sector; \n3. It would consider broadband support for media and community content services \n(as part of digital inclusion efforts); and \n4. It would think of broadband as a utility and a public service. \n \nCurrently, neither Canadian nor US policy fully supports the development of all these \nelements.  Ideally, policy supporting a hybrid public broadband model would:  \n \n1. Include government intervention by way of fiscal and\/or regulatory powers; \n 1\n5 \n2. Permit competition in local provision including ownership by governments and \nnon-profits; \n3. Acknowledge that digital inclusion and education are essential for integrating \nbroadband into local contexts, especially in low-income and deprived areas; \n4. Provide latitude for a variety of ownership and business models; and \n5. Most fundamentally, accept that broadband is essential infrastructure \u2013 this may \nrequire the return to a national broadband strategy in Canada and the creation of \nsuch a strategy in the US. \n \nThis policy would encourage both local and federal governments to take an active role in \nencouraging these hybrid networks. The policy would encourage both local government \nand local community groups to own and manage broadband networks or at least to take \nan active role in the creation of networks that cover the community. \n \nBoth the municipal ownership of broadband backhaul in Fredericton and the muncipal-\ncommunity partnership in Montreal provide some examples of recommendations 1. 2. \nand 4.  The digital inclusion program developed by Wireless Philadelphia, the non-profit \norganization now managing the Wi-Fi network in that city (see Wireless Philadelphia, \n2008) provides an example of how to achieve recommendation 2. \n \nMore broadly,  policies should encourage  hybrid municipal-community network owners \nto design, build and deploy broadband service as reliable as the other common utilities, \nsuch as water, power, and the telephone, with clear performance standards established. \nThe policy should also encourage these hybrids to build and deploy broadband service \ncoverage, which would include every household, business, organization, public space, \nand public transit corridor in the communities\u2019 coverage area. This policy should also \nencourage these hybrids to charge for the broadband service prices that are affordable, \nnondiscriminatory, and universally available in order to ensure universal access for all. \n \nSome mechanisms that policy makers might employ to encourage the formation of these \nhybrids are to first identify a common standard for broadband deployment including \ntechnological standards for fibre and Wi-Fi, reallocate underutilized spectrum for \nunlicensed citizen access and encourage government to offer grants that could  fund \nbroadband deployment for both municipal and citizen groups. \n \nWe strongly argue for the need for a National Broadband Policy in the US. In the case of \nCanada, we encourage a reinvigoration of the established policy. IBoth nations have \nadopted a deregulatory approach under the assumption that the market will build enough \ncapacity to meet the demand. The market may do a good job of providing reliable \ninfrastructure with reasonable quality of service, but it has no incentive to provide \nuniversal, ubiquitous coverage if it cannot generate sufficient profit doing so (Middleton, \n2007; Clement & Bryne-Potter, 2007). The business pressures of providing connectivity \ndo not ensure that networks will be built with the standards deemed important by \ncommunities. It is essential that alternative approaches to infrastructure development \nremain a priority for municipal governments, communities and national policymakers \n(Middleton et al., 2006; Clement & Bryne-Potter, 2007).  A uniform federal policy would \nbe most helpful in enabling state and local governments in regards to broadband \ndeployment.  \n \nIt is essential that municipalities and communities remain engaged in the offering of \nbroadband services. It is possible that public involvement in the provision of internet \n 1\n6 \nservice will diminish as the private sector continues to provide higher quality, more \nreliable connectivity than has been provided through most municipal or community \nprojects. Citizens may be lulled by better service into thinking the networks offered by \nprivate industry serves all of their interests. Municipalities and communities have \nfundamentally different goals in providing broadband Internet access than private \nindustry. Municipalities are interested in promoting civic engagement, social inclusion, \nand economic development across all neighborhoods and communities through the \ndeployment of their wireless network. Private industry must be concerned with the \nbottom line and provides service with a mind towards profits rather than social welfare. \nRegardless of who offers the service municipalities should take on the role of \nencouraging private industry to adopt the practices and policies needed to ensure their \nnetworks provide broadband connectivity that is in the public interest and meet all the \nneeds of the municipality, not just access alone. \n \nThese policy arguments appear distant from experiences in local communities. In many \nurban areas citizens have multiple choices for broadband service, which provide better \nquality and lower prices to the consumer. It is in these areas in which municipal \nbroadband projects are failing. In smaller cities, towns and rural areas the broadband \nchoices are few and municipalities are stepping in to offer services. In some cases this \nmunicipal action may spur incumbents on to offer more coverage and better service at \nlower prices, but where the population density is very low or impoverished, the \nmotivations will be few. In many cases the ownership of the broadband network is \nevolving. through outsourcing ownership and management of the service and more \nmunicipalities are forming complex partnerships with local incumbents. \n \nUnderstanding the unfulfilled expectations surrounding municipal and community Wi-Fi \nprojects helps to shift policy away from a determinist, technological imperative.  Even as \nbroadband connectivity becomes essential for full participation in North American life, \nconnectivity policy should consider digital inclusion and integration of broadband \ninfrastructure into a variety of existing or hybrid organizations.  These policy goals shift \nthe focus of broadband policy from a technological imperative to one focused on \nbalancing social goals and economic development.   \n \nThe importance of the hybrid-public policy process is evidenced from policies that \npromote digital inclusion in the new information economy. Unfortunately, there can be a \ndangerous tendency by public elites to \u201cplay down\u201d, over-simplify and polarize issues in \nthe short-term. This might result in wasted resources and false expectations, and may \nbe due, in part, to politicians\u2019 short-term tenure in office. This can be problematic as \nmost science and technology programs require a long-term and systematic approach \n(Bijker et al., 1987; Rogers, 1995). Government policy rhetoric anchored in the value of \nmunicipal sponsored networks needs to be met with significant funding, resources and \ncommunity support and direct involvement. As this research shows, there are dangers \nthat a superficial investment will lead to surface change that does little to improve the \nreality of communities \n \n \n 1\n7 \nREFERENCES \n \n \nAuray, N., Charbit, C., & Fernandez, V.
