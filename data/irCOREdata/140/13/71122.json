This unusual phenomenon was induced using\nO-mode transmissions at 5.423 MHz with 550 MW effective isotropic radiated power and\nthe pump beam dipped 9 degrees south. The pump frequency corresponds to the fourth\nelectron gyro-harmonic frequency at 215 km altitude. The EISCAT UHF radar observed a\npersistent pump-induced enhancement in the ion line data near the HF reflection altitude.\nThe optical and radar signatures of HF pumping started at\u223c230 km and descended to\u223c220\nkm within \u223c60 s. This effect has been modelled using the solution to differential equations\ndescribing pump-induced electron temperature and density perturbations. The decrease in\naltitude of the ion line by\u223c10 km and changes in electron density have been modelled. The\nresults show that an electron temperature enhancement of up to \u223c5700 K can be achieved,\nwhich is not sufficient to explain the observed optical emissions.\nKey words: Ionospheric heating; Electron acceleration\n1 Introduction\nLarge scale electron density and temperature modification as a result of ionospheric\nheating by high power high frequency (HF) radio waves in the F-region has been\nstudied from the early 1970s.

Electron temperature enhancements have\nbeen observed during O-mode heating and measured by incoherent scatter radar at\nArecibo, i. e. low latitude, by Gordon et al. (1971) and Gordon and Carlson (1974).\nAt high latitudes the first observations were performed in Troms\u00f8, Norway (Jones\net al., 1982, 1986; Robinson, 1989; Honary et al., 1993). Peak electron temperature\nenhancements up to\u223c50% were measured by Robinson (1989) and by Stocker et al.\n(1992) in the daytime. More recent observations show that much greater electron\ntemperature enhancements up to\u223c300% occur at night and when heating along the\nmagnetic field aligned direction (Rietveld et al., 2003). Modelling of electron tem-\nperature enhancements by ionospheric heating has been done for both high and low\nlatitudes (Stocker et al., 1992; Mingaleva and Mingalev, 1997; Sergienko et al.,\n2000; Vas\u2019kov et al., 1993). Using numerical models of the high latitude iono-\nsphere, Mingaleva and Mingalev (1997) found the electron temperature at its peak\ncan increase up to a maximum of 7300 K.\nHigh power HF electromagnetic radio waves can couple to high and low frequency\nelectrostatic plasma waves through parametric instabilities near the reflection height\nof the pump wave. At the reflection level of the O-mode pump wave the group ve-\nlocity of the wave decreases to zero and, as a result, the wave electric field max-\nimises, whilst becoming parallel to the direction of the ambient magnetic field line.\nDue to this field orientation in the so called plasma resonance region, where the\nplasma frequency equals the wave frequency, the electromagnetic wave can couple\nto variety of electrostatic waves through various instabilities such as the Oscillating\nTwo Stream Instability (OTSI) and Parametric Decay Instability (PDI) (Rietveld\net al., 1993; Kohl et al., 1993). However, only those electrostatic waves with a\nwave number half that of the probing radar can be detected by incoherent scatter\ntechniques. Therefore incoherent scatter observations of the plasma waves using\nUHF or VHF radars do not represent the whole spectrum of the Langmuir waves or\nplasma density oscillations excited in the interaction region of the HF wave.\nIncoherent scatter radars can be used to investigate the natural plasma param-\neters such as electron density and temperature. In the absence of a modifying\nwave, weak incoherent backscatter signals are detected from Doppler shifted Lang-\nmuir and ion acoustic waves. In the case of ionospheric modification using a high\npower radio wave, Langmuir waves and the associated ion acoustic waves are\nstrongly enhanced (Robinson, 1989). Such enhancements distort the incoherent\nscatter spectrum (Honary et al., 1999). As a result the ion line spectra cannot be\nanalysed assuming a Maxwellian plasma distribution and therefore ionospheric pa-\nrameters such as electron density and temperature cannot be reliably derived from\nthe backscattered spectra. In addition, Langmuir turbulence persists when pumping\nthe ionosphere on an electron gyroharmonic frequency (Honary et al., 1999). In\norder to estimate the electron temperature enhancements inside the heated volume,\na theoretical model based on the analytical solution of the perturbation equations\nby Gurevich (1978) is used in this paper. Radar data above and below the ion-line\nenhancement region during Heater-on phases are contaminated by aliasing effects.\n2\nHence, the need for such modelling is not only because the ion-line spectra can not\nbe analysed, but contamination in the radar data makes it impossible to estimate\nthe electron temperature within the heated volume by extrapolating from above\nand below the interaction altitude.\n2 Experimental observations\nOn 12 November 2001 the EISCAT HF facility (Rietveld et al., 1993) in Ramfjord,\nNorway, was operating at 5.423 MHz with an effective radiative power (ERP) of\n550 MW and a beam width of 7\u25e6. The pump frequency corresponds to the fourth\nelectron gyroharmonic at 215 km, which is close to the HF interaction altitude. For\nthe data analysed here the EISCAT radar beam was sweeping in 3\u25e6 steps moving\nfrom 3\u25e6S to 15\u25e6S of local zenith in a north-south meridian scan. The Heater pump\nbeam direction was fixed at 9\u25e6 S and was cycled with 2-min on, 2-min off. Artificial\noptical annuli, which were centred on the pump beam, formed a cylinder of optical\nemission above the pump wave reflection altitude and parallel to the magnetic field\nline direction. In \u223c 60 s the annulus collapses into a blob while descending in\naltitude. The same descend can be observed in the EISCAT UHF backscatter power\nenhancements near the reflection altitude. For full details of the experimental setup\nrefer to Kosch et al. (2004).\n3 Modelling\nA propagating electromagnetic wave can cause modification in the plasma and\ninteracts with other propagating waves through a variety of non-linear processes\n(Robinson, 1989). This is the case when a high power HF radio wave heats the\nionosphere during pumping experiments. Depending on conditions in the plasma,\nnon-linearities can manifest themselves in two different characteristic types in the\nionosphere. Firstly, for D-region up to lower F-region altitudes, the relatively high\nelectron density and collision frequency causes thermal non-linearity to arise in the\nelectrodynamic processes and the propagation of the electromagnetic wave. Sec-\nondly, in a collisionless plasma, where the electron mean free path is larger than\nthe dimensions of the perturbing electric field associated with the modifying wave,\ntransport processes such as thermal diffusion, thermal conductivity and particle dif-\nfusion are important. This is the case in the ionosphere above\u223c200 km (Gurevich,\n1978). Therefore two different mechanisms are responsible for electron heating in\nthe ionosphere, one is the result of ohmic heating of the electrons due to colli-\nsions with the neutrals, and the other is known as anomalous heating and is caused\nby electromagnetic waves coupling to electrostatic waves (e.g. Langmuir and ion\nacoustic) in the plasma. The latter occurs only during O-mode heating of the iono-\n3\nsphere.\nTheoretical models discuss two different approaches known as cascading and cav-\nitating or weak and strong Langmuir turbulence (WLT and SLT) to describe the\nnon-linear processes of wave-plasma interaction in the F-region. Both of these pro-\ncesses (WLT and SLT) are responsible for the radar observations within the heated\nvolume (Isham et al., 1999). Low latitude experiments at Arecibo show good agree-\nment with the theoretical SLT spectra in which cavitating turbulence is formed\nby the growth and collapse of cavitons (DuBois et al., 1990), whereas the radar\nfeatures observed for high latitude heating at Troms\u00f8 are mostly compatible with\nWLT, such as evidence of propagating Langmuir and ion acoustic waves in the\nradar plasma and ion line (Stubbe et al., 1992; Kohl et al., 1993). Furthermore,\nhigh latitude experiments do not confirm the existence of cavities and cavitons in\nthe high and low frequency electrostatic perturbations, and parametric decay repre-\nsents the major process responsible for Langmuir turbulence (Stubbe et al., 1992).\nHowever, when assuming either of the above approaches, the region of incoherent\nscatter, and associated ion line excitation, extends from the HF reflection height\ndown to the altitude where Langmuir waves with large wave numbers are strongly\nLandau damped. Therefore Langmuir and ion acoustic waves cannot be generated\noutside this region (Stubbe et al., 1984). Extending down from the reflection level,\nthe width of this region is \u223c0.1H, where H is the ionospheric scale height (Djuth\net al., 1994).\nRadar backscatter power measurements in the experiment analysed here show per-\nsistent ion line enhancements during heater-on cycles. The ion line enhancement\nechoes are a result of Langmuir turbulence near the reflection height (z0) and from\nthe parametric decay of the pump beam into the Langmuir waves and ion acoustic\nwaves at a lower altitude (za). za depends on the radar frequency (fr), ionospheric\nscale height (H) and heating frequency (f0). Applying linear parametric instability\ntheory to satisfy the Bragg condition in order to detect the plasma waves gives the\nfollowing equation for the location of the Langmuir and ion waves (Stubbe et al.,\n1992):\nza = z0 \u2212 12 \u03ba TefR\n2\nme c2f0\n2H (1)\nwhere me is electron mass, Te is electron temperature, \u03ba is Boltzmann\u2019s constant\nand c is the speed of light. In addition, ion acoustic waves connected to cascade\nprocesses can be detected at slightly higher altitudes (zb) where ion waves produce\nnon-linear Landau damping cascades:\nzb = z0 \u2212 3 \u03ba TefR\n2\nme c2f0\n2H (2)\nThese echoes can contribute to the backscatter ion line enhancements in the vicinity\n4\nof the O-mode reflection altitude (Djuth et al., 1994). Using a radar with sufficient\nrange resolution one should detect a plasma and ion line at za and ion line structure\nwithout a plasma line at zb. Nevertheless, if the resolution of the radar is comparable\nto the separation of the excitation altitudes only one ion line enhancement will be\nobservable (Stubbe et al., 1992). This is the case for the data analysed here. The\nEISCAT UHF radar data has a range resolution of \u223c 5.4 km which is similar to the\nestimated difference in height using Eq. 1 and 2 (\u223c3 km). Therefore the radar range\nresolution is not sufficient to resolve the two different signatures and we have used\nEq. 2 to estimate the reflection height for each heater-on cycle. However, using Eq.\n1 does not introduce significantly different results in calculating the temperature\nenhancements (\u22643%). No plasma line data were recorded on 12\/11\/2001.\nThe effect of the electron temperature enhancements on the electron density de-\npends on the altitude and ionospheric species. For instance, the effect of temper-\nature dependent changes in the electron recombination rates are only important at\nE-region to lower F-region altitudes. At these altitudes electron heating affects the\nO+2 and NO+ concentrations causing the electron density to increase. At altitudes\nwhere O+ is the dominant species (above \u223c 200 km, from the International Ref-\nerence Ionosphere), diffusion is responsible for the plasma\u2019s response to the elec-\ntron temperature enhancements, because the recombination rate coefficient for this\nspecies does not depend on the electron ambient temperature (Gurevich, 1978).\nThe stationary solutions to the linearised temperature (Te) and density (Ne) per-\nturbation equations (Gurevich, 1978) have been used to model the temperature en-\nhancements inside the heated volume:\n4N = N0\u03b31\n2\nLNLT Q\u02dc\nL2N \u2212 L2T\n(\nexp[\u2212|x\u2016 \u2212 x0|\/LN ]\nLT\n\u2212 exp[\u2212|x\u2016 \u2212 x0|\/LT ]\nLN\n)...\n\u2212N0kT\n2\nL2NQ\u02dc\nL2N \u2212 L2T\n(\nexp[\u2212|x\u2016 \u2212 x0|\/LT ]\nLT\n\u2212 exp[\u2212|x\u2016 \u2212 x0|\/LN ]\nLN\n) (3)\n4Te = Te0Q\u02dc\n2LT\nexp(\u2212|x\u2016 \u2212 x0|\nLT\n) (4)\nIon heating is assumed to be negligible. The unperturbed electron density (N0) and\ntemperature (Te0) are derived from EISCAT measurements prior to each heater cy-\ncle. x0 is the reflection altitude of the pump wave, x\u2016 is the coordinate along the\nmagnetic field line direction. It has been assumed that the dimensions of electron\ntemperature and density inhomogeneity perpendicular to the magnetic field is larger\nthan the electron mean free path so that only longitudinal thermal conductivity and\ndiffusion become important. LT and LN are the characteristic length of tempera-\nture and density inhomogeneity. kT is the thermal-diffusion ratio kT = DTea\/Da, in\nwhich Da is the ambipolar diffusion coefficient, DTea is electron coefficient of am-\nbipolar diffusion, \u03b31 is the ionisation equilibrium shift coefficient, \u03b31 = Te0(\u2202qr\/\u2202Te)N0(\u2202qr\/\u2202N) ,\n5\nin which qr is electron loss per cm3 per second as a result of recombination.\nThe height integrated heat input per unit volume per second is given by\nQ\u02dc =\n\u222b\n\u03d5E0\n2\/EP\n2 where \u03d5 = \u03d5P\/\u03d5T , E0 is the modifying electric field, EP is\nthe ambient electric field of the plasma, \u03d5P is the polarisation factor and \u03d5T is the\nnon-isothermy factor. Using Eq. (3) the heat input of the electromagnetic wave can\nbe calculated. Knowing the heat input per unit volume, one can derive from Eq. (4)\nthe temperature enhancements associated with the heating at the height indicated\nby the ion line enhancement altitude.\nNeutral atmosphere parameters such as the density of neutral species have been\nobtained from the MSIS-90 atmospheric model. It has been argued that MSIS\ndoes not agree well with the observations at high latitudes. The MSIS model is\nbased on extensive data input from different sources such as satellites and incoher-\nent scatter radars. At high latitudes and for F-region altitudes the data coverage is\nrelatively poor and therefore it is mostly influenced by the mid-latitude measure-\nments (E. Griffin, private communication). However, comparisons between FPI\nmeasured neutral temperatures and those from the MSIS model show good agree-\nment for quiet geomagnetic activity conditions (Kosch et al., 2000a). In our case,\nKp=0 throughout the experiment. Therefore we use MSIS model with high con-\nfidence for the neutral atmosphere. The ion composition and densities have been\nderived from the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI-2001). The same com-\nments regarding reliability apply to this model.\nFigure 1 summarises the electron temperature modelling results. The top panel\nshows the logarithm of raw backscattered power from the EISCAT UHF radar.\nThe intervals indicated by black lines represent heater-on cycles. The labels are\nradar zenith angles south of vertical. Persistent and strong ion line enhancements\nare mostly observed in the direction of magnetic field line (12\u25e6 S) and 9\u25e6 S. The\nbackscatter coming from 6\u25e6 S or 15\u25e6 S do not show persistent enhancements during\nheating. For 3\u25e6 S no useful backscatter was obtained. For the cases where the ion\nline enhancements do not persist throughout the heater-on cycle, an extrapolation\nhas been performed to derive the height of ion line enhancements after 2 minutes.\nBy fitting a second order polynomial to the ion line enhancements, the final height\nhas been estimated for these cases only.\nKnowing the start and end height of the backscattered enhancements, and calcu-\nlating the ionospheric scale height (H) from the EISCAT electron density profile,\nthe HF reflection height has been computed. The middle panel of Fig. 1 shows the\ncalculated HF reflection heights corresponding to the start and end of the heater-\non cycles (blue and red curve, respectively) derived from Eq. (2). The black curve\nis the reflection altitude calculated from EISCAT electron density profile. This is\ngenerally within 1-2 range gates of HF reflection altitude predicted by Eq. 2. The\nclear descent in the height of the backscatter enhancements represents the change in\nelectron density during each heater-on cycle because the pump frequency remains\n6\nconstant. Therefore, for each heater cycle, the changes in the electron density of\nthe interaction altitude is equal to the difference of cold plasma electron density\nat the start and end altitude. Based on this assumption and using Eqs. (3) and (4)\nthe final temperature has been calculated using the EISCAT electron temperature\nmeasurements just before pump-on at the starting altitude (Te0).\nThe bottom panel of Fig. 1 shows the initial electron temperature (blue curve) and\ndensity (green curve) from EISCAT data and the modelled final electron temper-\nature (red curve) all for the final altitude of each heater-on cycle. The error bars\nstem from the radar measurement uncertainty of initial density and temperature.\nThe average modelled temperature uncertainty is \u223c11%. There are no clear ion\nline enhancements for the periods when the heater was pointing 3\u25e6 S, therefore it\nis not possible to derive the electron temperature for these intervals. It is important\nto emphasize that the estimated temperature, has been calculated for one single al-\ntitude (end height of the ion line enhancement) and after 2-minutes of each heating\nperiod (steady state).\n4 Discussion\nFor our experiment the average temperature enhancement for all directions is\u223c4800\nK. Table 1 shows the average electron temperature for different radar zenith angles.\nThe maximum temperature (5700 K) occurs for 9\u25e6 S parallel to the pump beam di-\nrection. Although the pump power is approximately half of maximum in the mag-\nnetic field line direction (12\u25e6 S), the electron temperature increases up to 5500 K\nin the magnetic zenith. This is consistent with Rietveld et al. (2003) who found the\ntemperature maximum at 12\u25e6 S. Their angular scan resolution was only 6\u25e6 and no\nmeasurements were made at 9\u25e6 S. For the same angular step, the modelled temper-\nature drops off more rapidly towards local zenith (2700 K at 6\u25e6 S) than beyond the\nmagnetic zenith (5100 K at 15\u25e6 S).\nTemperatures up to \u223c 3000 K have been measured by Rietveld et al. (2003) using\nan ERP of\u223c 205 MW. In the region of the F-layer maximum where the electron-ion\ncollision frequency is much higher than the electron-neutral collision frequency, the\nelectronic thermal conductivity coefficient (\u03bae) increases rapidly with electron tem-\nperature: \u03bae \u223c T 5\/2e (Gurevich, 1978; Schunk and Nagy, 1978). Hence, doubling\nthe ERP does not double the electron temperature. Our result is consistent with that\nof Rietveld et al. (2003): (i.e. (550MW\n205MW\n) \u223c (4800K\n3000K\n)2\/5).\nThe electron density at the reflection altitude is given by f = 8.98\n\u221a\nN . For\nf=5.423 MHz, Ne = 3.6 \u00d7 1011m\u22123. Assuming the average heated bulk electron\ntemperature of 4800 K has a Maxwellian distribution, the characteristic kinetic\nenergy of the electrons is \u223c0.31 eV. The excitation of the 557.7 and 630.0 nm\nemissions require electrons with energies higher than 4.17 eV and 1.96 eV, re-\n7\nspectively (Rees, 1989). Therefore the flux of the electrons producing these two\nemissions can be calculated from the Maxwellian distribution. About 4% of the en-\nergetic electrons contribute to the production of photons by collisions (Rees, 1963).\nIntegrating 4% of the total electron population greater than 1.96 eV (4.17 eV) a to-\ntal of 1.87\u00d7108m\u22123 (2.96\u00d7105m\u22123) electrons contribute to creating the 630.0 nm\n(557.7 nm) emission. Considering a uniform spherical emission volume of radius\n13.5 km at \u223c 220 km altitude (-3 dB beam size), the estimated photon production\nrate is \u223c 27 Rayleighs (R) for 630.0 nm and \u223c 0.05 R for 557.7 nm. These intensi-\nties are significantly smaller than those observed by Kosch et al. (2004) (300 R for\nred line and 100 R for green line). This indicates that the electron flux required to\nexplain the optical intensities detected are much higher than the Maxwellian flux.\nHence, the assumption of a thermal distribution for the accelerated electrons can-\nnot be applied to our observations. This is in agreement with the persistent ion line\nenhancements in the backscatter spectra within the heated volume which indicate a\nturbulent plasma.\nIt is important to note that the observed electron density changes cannot be due to\nfurther ionisation of species such as O+, O+2 and N+2 . This is due to the fact that\nthe ionisation threshold for such ions are O+: 13.6 eV, O+2 : 12 eV and N+2 : 15.5\neV (Rees, 1989) which is \u001d 0.31 eV, which corresponds to the average modelled\ntemperature of 4800 K. Therefore the heated bulk plasma temperature is not high\nenough to ionise these species.\nModelling studies of the artificial optical emissions at 630.0 nm show that the ob-\nserved emissions could be caused by electrons with very high energy (& 5000 K)\ninside small scale striations produced by the electromagnetic pump waves (Gure-\nvich and Milikh, 1997). Gurevich et al. (1995) suggested that the striations, or\nmagnetic field aligned irregularities, are regions with very high electron temper-\nature which are within larger volumes of ambient plasma with a lower temperature.\nHowever, doubt has been cast on this theory because it is inconsistent with the pres-\nsure balance along the magnetic field (Borisov et al., 2004). The incoherent scatter\nradar is only capable of measuring the electron temperature assuming a uniform\nthermal plasma in the scattering volume. Hence, the temperatures measurements\nfrom radar data in such circumstances would be the weighted average of plasma\ntemperatures within the radar beam.\n5 Conclusion\nThe model predicts an average electron temperature of \u223c 5500 K along the mag-\nnetic field line inside the heated volume. The maximum temperature of \u223c5700 K\noccurs at 9\u25e6 S, i.e., where the pump power is maximum. Neither the red nor green\nline steady-state optical emission can be explained by a thermal plasma of 4800\nK. Clearly, non-linear electron acceleration is active throughout the experiment.\n8\nTable 1.
