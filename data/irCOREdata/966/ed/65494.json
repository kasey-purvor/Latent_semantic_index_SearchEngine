Interventions \n 3 \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThe work environment has long been acknowledged as an important determinant of health \nand health inequalities. In the past, dangerous physical working conditions were a major \ncause of ill-health in the working age population and, because of the steep social gradient in \nphysical working conditions, of social inequalities in health (Marmot et al., 1999). In recent \ntimes in high-income countries, however, the physical work environment has been improved \nimmensely and may now play a lesser role as a determinant of working age population health \nin general and social inequalities in health in particular (Marmot et al., 1999). The \npsychosocial work environment, however, has become more prominent as a determinant of \nhealth (Benach et al., 2007; Black, 2008; Department for Work and Pensions, 2005; \nDepartment of Health, 2004; United States Department of Health and Human Services, \n2002), and it exhibits a strong social gradient which influences inequalities in health amongst \nemployees (Marmot et al., 1999; Marmot et al., 1991). \n \nOne of the most influential theoretical models describing the relationship between the \npsychosocial work environment, health and inequalities in health is the \u201edemand control \n(support)\u201f model. This hypothesis states that the physical and mental health of employees are \nnegatively associated with job demands and positively associated with control and social \nsupport in the workplace. Epidemiological research, especially from the Whitehall studies, has \nbeen generally supportive of the hypothesis suggesting a relationship between the \npsychosocial work environment, work related stress and health status. Specifically, high strain \njobs (high demand combined with low control) are associated with adverse health outcomes, \nincluding increased risk of heart disease,(Bosma et al., 1997; Karasek et al., 1981; Kuper & \nMarmot, 2003) musculoskeletal pain,(Bongers et al., 1993) poor mental health,(Stansfeld S, \n1999) and sickness absence.(North et al., 1996) High strain jobs are concentrated amongst \nlower socio-economic groups and thus, the psychosocial work environment is considered an \nimportant influence on health inequalities amongst the working population. (Marmot, 2005; \nMarmot et al., 1997; Marmot et al., 1999; Marmot et al., 1991).  \n \nThe effort-reward imbalance model focuses on other aspects of the psychosocial work \nenvironment, specifically the social reciprocity which is at the heart of the work contract: \ncertain tasks or obligations are performed in exchange for equitable rewards. (Marmot et al., \n1999) Rewards include money, esteem, terms and conditions, career opportunities, job \nsecurity. The effort-reward imbalance model focuses on the adverse health effects of when \nthese rewards are not perceived to be equitable, so called high effort - low reward \nsituations.(Siegrist, 1996) This has led to analysis of the health and psychosocial aspects of \nother aspects of the organisation of work such as working hours, flexibility, job security and so \nforth (Benach et al., 2007). \n \n 4 \nVarious interventions have been developed, based on the relationship between the \npsychosocial work environment and health. The focus of these interventions varies from the \nindividual employee by, for example, implementing interventions (such as counselling) which \nhelp individuals \u201ccope\u201d with a stressful psychosocial work environment, to the organisation by, \nfor example, increasing the participation of employees in organisational decision making (e.g. \nparticipatory staff meetings) (Karasek, 1992). Similarly, interventions focusing on the wider \npsychosocial organisation of work, target individuals and how they manage precarious \nemployment or shift work, or focus on more upstream organisational changes such as \nreduced working hours or the right to flexible working (Benach et al., 2007). This article \nfocuses on the health effects of organisational interventions only.  \n \nAlthough much of the psychosocial work environment research base is observational and \navailable only in primary studies, there is a growing quasi-experimental literature which \nexamines the effects of organisational interventions, some of which has been synthesised in \nsystematic reviews. Much of this review level evidence lies outside the traditional boundaries \nof public health research, for example in the human resources, management, economics or \nnursing literature. It is therefore under-used in public health policy. Umbrella reviews are an \nincreasingly common way of identifying, appraising, and synthesising such systematic \nreviews (Bialy et al., 2006; Egan et al., 2008; Main et al., 2008; Morrison et al., 2003) and \nmaking them suitable for a new audience - in this case public health researchers, practitioners \nand policy makers (Wanless, 2004). In addition, umbrella reviews are able to present the \noverarching findings of such systematic reviews (Higgins & Green, 2008). This article \ntherefore presents the results of an umbrella review of the health effects of organisational \nlevel changes to the psychosocial work environment. It has a special focus on differential \nimpacts by socio-economic status. Additionally, it explores whether the effects of the \ninterventions differed across other sub-groups specifically age, gender, and ethnicity.  \n \n \nMETHODS \nSystematic methods were used to locate and evaluate published and unpublished systematic \nreviews of organisational level psychosocial work environment interventions. This umbrella \nreview was part of a wider project funded by the English Department of Health, Policy \nResearch Programme, via the Public Health Research Consortium (PHRC) on systematic \nreviews of interventions to address the social determinants of health. It was conducted by a \nUK based team between October 2006 and December 2007. \n \n  \n 5 \nObjectives \nThe objectives of this umbrella review were three-fold:  \n \n(1) To identify what types of organisational level changes to the psychosocial work \nenvironment have been previously systematically reviewed, to describe what the systematic \nreviews concluded about health effects and to highlight what gaps there are in the existing \nreview literature. \n(2) To assess to what extent existing systematic reviews have considered the impacts of such \ninterventions on socio-economic inequalities health, what the reviews concluded, what gaps \nexist, and what this means for tackling socio-economic inequalities in health amongst the \nworking age population.   \n(3) To explore to what extent existing systematic reviews have considered the differential \nimpacts of such interventions by age, gender, or ethnicity, what the reviews found, and what \nthis might mean for future research.  \n \n \nSearch Strategy  \nInitially, the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) Wider Public Health (WPH) \ndatabase (a web based database of systematic reviews of public health and related \ninterventions) was manually searched. This consists of evidence from systematic reviews \nrelevant to public health policy and practice and covers the period from 2000 to 2002. To \nsupplement this, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) and the Database of \nAbstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (both administrative and public databases \nhttp:\/\/www.crd.york.ac.uk\/crdweb\/html\/help.htm covering nursing, economics, human \nresources and management journals) were searched electronically whilst the Campbell \nCollaboration Database and the Evidence for Policy and Practice Information and \nCoordinating Centre (EPPI-Centre) database of health promotion and public health studies, \nwere manually searched from January 2002 to April 2007. Electronic searches of the Criminal \nJustice Abstracts database (2000-2007) were also undertaken (as it is not covered by any of \nthese databases of systematic reviews). Bibliographies, reference lists, and relevant websites \nwere also searched. Experts were contacted and we hand searched four journals (American \nJournal of Public Health, American Journal of Preventive Medicine, Journal of Epidemiology \nand Community Health, Social Science and Medicine) from January 2002 to April 2007.   \n \nInclusion and exclusion criteria  \nOnly reviews from 2000\u20132007 of adult participants (16+) or the general population in \ndeveloped countries (North America, Europe, Australasia, Japan) were eligible for inclusion.  \nAll types of changes to the psychosocial work environment which focused on the \norganisational rather than just the individual level were included. Reviews of individual level \ninterventions or changes to the physical environment were excluded.  \n 6 \n \nIn terms of outcomes, we were particularly interested in the impacts on inequalities in health \nor wellbeing (primarily by socio-economic status, but also in terms of age, gender or ethnicity) \nalthough we also addressed the overall health effect. Based on descriptive epidemiological \nstudies of the relationship between the psychosocial work environment and various health \nand wellbeing indicators, (Marmot et al., 1999) a wide range of outcomes was considered \nrelevant (Box 1).  \n \n \nBox 1: Health and wellbeing outcomes of interest  \n \nHealth  \n\uf0a7 Changes in the prevalence of specific diseases (e.g. musculoskeletal disease or \ncirculatory disease) \n\uf0a7 General or indirect measures of physical or psychological health and wellbeing \n(such as GP visits or the General Health Questionnaire).  \n\uf0a7 Sickness absence rates \n\uf0a7 Health behaviours (cigarette or alcohol consumption, physical activity) \n\uf0a7 Injuries resulting from accidents. \n \nWellbeing \n\uf0a7 Physical and mental wellbeing (such as tiredness, fatigue and sleep) \n\uf0a7 Social impacts (work\/life balance, quality of life, or time spent with family)  \n\uf0a7 Psychosocial outcomes (e.g. levels of job demand, control or support).  \n \nHealth Inequalities \n\uf0a7 Differences in health or wellbeing outcomes by socio-economic status (e.g. \nincome, occupational class, education, employment grade) \n\uf0a7 Differences in health or wellbeing outcomes by demographic characteristics (age, \ngender, ethnicity) \n 7 \nTo be included, systematic reviews had to meet the two mandatory criteria of the Database of \nAbstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE): that there is a defined review question and that an \neffort has been made to identify all the relevant literature (www.crd.york.ac.uk\/crdweb\/). An \nidentified review was classified as a systematic review when the review question was \nexplicitly defined in terms of two or more criteria of, the interventions, participants, outcomes \nor study designs, and the literature search criteria (a minimum of one or more named \ndatabases needed to be searched, in conjunction with either reference checking, hand-\nsearching, citation searching or contact with authors in the field) were adequately fulfilled.   \n \nData Extraction and Critical Appraisal  \nTwo reviewers (CB\/MG) independently screened all titles and abstracts identified from the \nliterature search for relevance (n=1694).  Full paper manuscripts of any titles\/abstracts that \nwere considered relevant by either reviewer were obtained (n=84) and independently \nassessed for inclusion. Any discrepancies were resolved by consensus and if necessary a \nthird reviewer (MP) was consulted. The following data were extracted: review details, \nintervention, search strategy, inclusion\/exclusion criteria, number of studies in the review, \noutcomes evaluated, methods used to synthesise the findings, the results obtained, and the \nauthors\u201f conclusions and research recommendations. Primary studies contained in each \nreview were checked for duplication and none was present. Each systematic review was \ncritically appraised using a checklist list adapted from DARE. The checklist was used to \nhighlight variations in the reviews and assess the reliability and validity of the reviews (see \nBox 2).  \n \n 8 \n \nBox 2: Methodological Quality Checklist \n \n1. Is there a well defined question? \n- The question should define at least the participants, the intervention, the \noutcomes and the study designs. \n \n2. Is there a defined search strategy?  \n- The search strategy should include at least one named database combined \nwith reference checking, hand-searching, citation follow-up, or expert \ncontact. \n \n3. Are inclusion \/ exclusion criteria stated? \n- The review should make the grounds for study inclusion and exclusion \ntransparent in terms of participants, intervention, outcomes and study \ndesign. \n \n4. Are the primary study designs and number of studies clearly stated? \n- The review should outline the designs of included studies and make it clear \nwhich and how many studies are in the final synthesis.   \n \n5. Have the primary studies been quality assessed? \n- The review should clearly describe the quality assessment process, which \nquality appraisal tool is used, and the relative quality of each included study.  \n \n6. Have the studies been appropriately synthesised? \n- The review should use meta-analysis or narrative synthesis, whichever is \nmost suitable given the heterogeneity of studies and their methodological \nquality. If studies are very heterogeneous, narrative synthesis is \nappropriate.  \n \n7. Has more than one author been involved at each stage of the review process? \n- To minimise bias, the review should have at least two reviewers involved in \neach stage (study selection, data extraction, quality appraisal, synthesis) of \nthe review.  \n \nSource:  Adapted from Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Main et al \n(2008) and Egan et al (2008). \n 9 \nRESULTS \nSeven reviews addressing the health effects of changes to the psychosocial work \nenvironment were located: three examined increased employee control (Aust & Ducki, 2004; \nBambra et al., 2007; Egan et al., 2007a), and four evaluated the effects of changes to the \norganisation of work (shift work, privatisation, health and safety legislation)(Bambra et al., \n2008a; Bambra et al., 2008b; Egan et al., 2007b; Rivara & Thompson, 2000). Five of the \nreviews specifically examined effects on health inequalities (Bambra et al., 2007; Bambra et \nal., 2008a; Bambra et al., 2008b; Egan et al., 2007a; Egan et al., 2007b). Five of the reviews \nmet all seven of the critical appraisal criteria (Bambra et al., 2007; Bambra et al., 2008a; \nBambra et al., 2008b; Egan et al., 2007a; Egan et al., 2007b). The results of these seven \nreviews are summarised by intervention type in tables 1-3 as well as synthesised narratively, \ntaking into account the results of the critical appraisal.  \n \nEmployee Control  \nThree reviews examined the health effects of increasing employee control in the workplace \n(Table 1). Two focused largely on increasing employee participation in workplace decision \nmaking (Aust & Ducki, 2004; Egan et al., 2007a), whilst the other examined the effects of \nincreased control over work tasks (Bambra et al., 2007).  \n \nThe review by Aust and Ducki (2004) synthesised five retrospective studies of \u201cDusseldorf \nhealth circle\u201d interventions (employee discussion groups in which decisions were made about \nimproving harmful working conditions). The review concluded that the effects on health were \nmixed and inconclusive. Sickness absence decreased in the four uncontrolled studies (by \nbetween 2% and 5%), and two of these also found improvements in psychosocial outcomes \nand general health. However, there was no significant difference in health outcomes between \nthe intervention and the control group in the one controlled study. The review did not address \ndifferential effects by socio-economic or demographic group. In terms of rigour, the review \nmet six of the seven critical appraisal criteria (it was not clear if more than one reviewer had \nbeen involved at each stage of the review). \n \nThe review of participatory employee committees (involvement of employees or employee \nrepresentatives in modifying the workplace, in budgetary decisions, or in personnel matters) \nsynthesised eighteen studies (Egan et al., 2007a). The review found that participatory \ncommittee interventions which increased employee control had a consistent and positive \nimpact on self-reported health. The review also looked for evidence of differential effects by \ngender, ethnicity and socio-economic status. However, only three such studies were included \nin the review. One controlled prospective Dutch study found that serum cholesterol levels \nimproved for men but not women (pre-post: men, p=0.02; women, p=0.09)(Maes et al., 1998) \nAn American prospective controlled study found that psychosocial outcomes improved \namongst African-American and Hispanic, but not white, employees (p<0.05).(Park et al., \n 10 \n2004) An uncontrolled UK study found improvements in mental health (mean anxiety and \ndepression scores) amongst manual workers (from 2.71 to 2.45; p<0.01) but not managers or \nclerical employees.(Parker et al., 1997) This review met all of the appraisal criteria.  \n \n \nThe third review examined nineteen studies of the health effects of three types of changes to \nemployee control over work tasks: increasing task variety, team working and autonomous \ngroups (Bambra et al., 2007). The review found that task structure interventions did not \ngenerally alter levels of employee control. However, where job control decreased and work \ndemands increased, self-reported mental health appeared to get worse. This review also \nlooked a priori for evidence of differential effects and three such studies were included. One \nuncontrolled Austrian study of civil servants found that the adverse health effects of a team \nworking intervention were only experienced by the lowest grade of employees.(Korunka et al., \n2003) Similarly, a controlled study of team working amongst Japanese factory workers found \nthat depression levels improved only in men not women.(Kawakami et al., 1997) However, an \nuncontrolled study of team working amongst UK doctors found no difference between men \nand women in terms of anxiety or depression.(Appleton et al., 1998) This was a well \nconducted review meeting all seven of the appraisal criteria.  \n 11 \nTable 1: Summary of psychosocial work environment reviews (n=3)  \nReview details Main findings  Quality \nAppraisal* \nAust and Ducki (2004)  \n \nReview Objective: To assess the effects of health \ncircles \nIntervention(s): Dusseldorf Health circles \u2013 staff \ndiscussion groups on improving potentially \nharmful working conditions (including \npsychosocial) \nPopulation: Employees \nHealth outcomes: Health and wellbeing  \nNumber of relevant primary studies: 5, retrospective \nstudies with\/without control.  \nNumber of databases searched: 10 \nLocation: Germany.  \nSynthesis method: Narrative \n \nMixed results: sickness \nabsence increased in the \ncontrolled study, whilst it \ndecreased in the four \nuncontrolled studies.

Four of these reviews met all seven of the appraisal criteria \nalthough the review by Rivara and Thompson met only five (it was unclear if the primary \nstudies had been quality appraised or if more than one reviewer had been involved at each \nstage of the review).  \n \n \nShift work interventions  \nTwo systematic reviews specifically examined organisational-level workplace interventions \namongst shift workers (Table 2). One focused on the health and psychosocial effects of \nchanging to a compressed working week,(Bambra et al., 2008a) whilst the other examined \nvarious other changes to shift work schedules (Bambra et al., 2008b).  \n \nIn the review of compressed working weeks (usually changing from five days of 8hr shifts to \nfour days of 12hr shifts) (Bambra et al., 2008a), 40 studies were synthesised. The review \nfound that whilst positive health effects were not always evident, there was seldom a \ndetrimental effect. Work-life balance was often improved by such interventions. The review \nlooked for evidence of differential effects but only one study included in the review, an \nuncontrolled Canadian study of factory workers, differentiated outcomes by socio-economic or \ndemographic group.  It found that total morbidity and injury rates decreased amongst men, \nbut not women, after the change to a compressed working week.(Laundry & Lees, 1991) \n \n \nTable 2: Changes to the Organisation of Work: Summary of reviews on shift work (n=2)  \nReview details Main findings  Quality \nAppraisal* \nBambra et al (2008a)**  \n \nReview Objective:   To systematically review \nstudies of the effects of the \nCompressed Working Week on the \nhealth and work-life balance of shift \nworkers, and to identify any \ndifferential impacts by socio-\neconomic group. \nIntervention(s): Changing from an 8hr, 5 day \nweek to a Compressed Working Week \n(CWW) of a 12hr\/10hr, 4 day week.  \nPopulation: Shift workers \nHealth outcomes: Health inequalities, specific \ndiseases, general measures of \nphysical or psychological health and \nHealth effects were \ninconclusive, although \nthere was seldom a \ndetrimental effect.

It found that three types of intervention \nhad beneficial effects on health and work-life balance: (1) Switching from slow to fast shift \nrotation (slow rotation is six or seven consecutive shifts of the same type, fast rotation is a \nmaximum of three or four consecutive shifts of the same type); (2) Changing from backward \n(night, afternoon, morning) to forward (morning, afternoon, night) shift rotation; and (3) self-\nscheduling of shifts. Again, although this review was designed to look for studies of health \ninequalities, only one of the included studies differentiated outcomes by age group. This \nuncontrolled prospective cohort found that amongst male steel workers in Finland, changing \nfrom slow to fast rotation improved sleep quality amongst older, but not younger, \nworkers.(Hakola & Harma, 2001) \n \n \nPrivatisation \nOne review (Egan et al., 2007b) examined eleven studies of the effects on general health, \nhealth inequalities, injury rates and psychosocial outcomes of the privatisation of public \nutilities and industries (Table 3). The review suggested that the job insecurity and \nunemployment resulting from privatisation had an adverse impact on mental health and on \nsome physical health outcomes. One of the aims of this review was to synthesise data on \nhealth inequalities. However, only one of the studies in the review contained any relevant \ndata. It found that eight months after privatisation, occupational stress amongst clerical and \nadministrative staff had increased significantly, although manual workers and managers \nexperienced no such changes over the same period.(Nelson, 1999) \n \n  \nHealth and safety legislation \nOne review (Rivara & Thompson, 2000) examined the effects of increased enforcement of \nhealth and safety legislation on the number of fall related injuries in the USA construction \nindustry (Table 3). Based on administrative (workers compensation) data, it found that \nincreased regulation, especially when enforced with inspections, is associated with a \ndecrease in fall injury rates.  The review did not look for studies of differential impacts.  \n 16 \nTable 3: Changes to the Organisation of Work: Summary of reviews on privatisation \n(n=1) and health and safety (n=1) \n* See box 1.  \n \nReview details Main findings Quality \nAppraisal* \nEgan et al (2007)  \nReview Objective:  To systematically review \nthe effects of privatising industries and \nutilities on the health and health \ninequalities of employees and the public. \nIntervention(s): Privatisation of public utilities \nand industries \nPopulation: Those affected by privatisation of \npublic utilities and industries \n(employees and general public) \nHealth Outcomes:  General health, \npsychosocial outcomes and injury rates, \nhealth inequalities.  \nNumber of relevant primary studies: 11, \nprospective with\/without controls, \nuncontrolled interrupted time series \nanalyses.  \nNumber of databases searched: 21 \nLocation: UK and Portugal. \nSynthesis method: Narrative \n \nHigher quality studies \nsuggested that job \ninsecurity and \nunemployment resulting \nfrom privatisation impacted \nadversely on mental health \nand on some physical \nhealth outcomes. \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \nRivara and Thompson (2000)  \n \nReview Objective: The objective of this study \nwas to review the evidence for the \neffectiveness of different strategies to \nprevent falls from heights in the \nconstruction industry. \nIntervention(s): Legal regulations (increased \nsafety regulations) to prevent falls from \nheight in construction industry. \nPopulation:  Construction workers \nHealth Outcomes:  self-reported falls, self-\nreported injuries, documented falls \n(workers compensation), and injuries. \nNumber of relevant primary studies: 1, \ncontrolled cross-sectional ecological \nstudy of administrative data. \nNumber of databases searched: 5 \nLocation:  USA \nSynthesis method: Narrative \nIncreased regulation, when \nenforced with inspections, \nmight be associated with a \ndecrease in fall injury rates. \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n6 \n 17 \nDISCUSSION  \nEffects of the Interventions \nOverall, the systematic review evidence synthesised in our umbrella review suggests that \norganisational level changes to the psychosocial work environment can have important and \ngenerally beneficial effects on health. Further, the five reviews which examined differences by \nsocio-economic or demographic group (Bambra et al., 2007; Bambra et al., 2008a; Bambra et \nal., 2008b; Egan et al., 2007a; Egan et al., 2007b), when taken together, tentatively suggest \nthat organisational workplace interventions may also have the potential to have an impact on \nhealth inequalities amongst employees. \n \nHealth and wellbeing  \nChanges to employee control appeared to have had mixed, but largely positive, impacts on \nhealth outcomes. Similarly, in terms of the wider changes to the psychosocial organisation of \nwork, the two reviews of changes to shift work identified positive impacts on work-life balance \nof the compressed working week, switching from slow to fast shift rotation, changing from \nbackward to forward shift rotation, and self-scheduling of shifts.(Bambra et al., 2008a; \nBambra et al., 2008b) The latter three interventions were also found to have positive effects \non mental health. Similarly, the review of health and safety legislation in the construction \nindustry found a decrease in fall-related injuries after the intervention (Rivara & Thompson, \n2000). The review of privatisation suggested that increased job insecurity and unemployment \nresulting from privatisation impacted adversely on mental health (Egan et al., 2007b).  \n \nHealth Inequalities  \nFive of the seven reviews examined differential health effects by socio-economic or \ndemographic group (Bambra et al., 2007; Bambra et al., 2008a; Bambra et al., 2008b; Egan \net al., 2007a; Egan et al., 2007b). Generally, they found a larger effect for men compared to \nwomen, and that the interventions were more likely to improve health amongst ethnic \nminorities and older workers. This may have been because the pre-intervention health status \nof these groups was considerably lower and thus they had more to gain from the intervention. \nHowever, it may also be because the health effects of work may be greater for some groups \nthan others. For example, studies have traditionally shown a stronger association between \nwork and health amongst men than women (Bartley et al., 2006). In terms of socio-economic \nstatus, the participatory interventions improved mental health amongst manual but not \nmanagerial or clerical employees. Whereas the adverse effects of team working and \nprivatisation were experienced more by the lower grades of employees. This suggests that \nthe positive and negative health effects of organisational changes to the psychosocial work \nenvironment are felt more by men and lower socio-economic groups.  \n \n 18 \nResearch, Policy and Practice \nResearch  \nIn comparison to other public health interventions addressing the social determinants of \nhealth, the systematic review evidence base on organisational changes to the work \nenvironment is fairly well developed (Millward et al., 2003).  Further, the existing reviews are \ngenerally well conducted with six meeting all seven of the critical appraisal criteria. However, \nin terms of gaps in the coverage of the systematic review evidence base, this umbrella review \nsuggests that there is a particular need for future reviews to examine the health impacts of \nwider organisational changes to the psychosocial work environment such as flexible working, \npart-time working, or other interventions which may enhance work-life balance.  \n \nThere was a consensus amongst all the reviews on the issue of future primary research, \ncalling for the conduct of prospective (preferably randomised) controlled studies of \norganisational level workplace interventions. Such studies also need to record the wider \norganisation and labour market context in which the interventions take place (Egan et al., \n2007b). Further, the need for studies which evaluate any differential impacts of interventions \nby socio-economic status was particularly noted (Bambra et al., 2007; Bambra et al., 2008a; \nBambra et al., 2008b; Egan et al., 2007a).  \n \n \nPolicy and Practice \nIn terms of policy and practice, the findings of our umbrella review suggest that the increasing \nfocus on psychosocial conditions in the workplace in national public health strategies is \nsoundly based (Black, 2008; Department for Work and Pensions., 2005; Department of \nHealth, 2004; United States Department of Health and Human Services, 2002). Specifically, \nthe systematic reviews suggest that increasing employee job control (Bambra et al., 2007; \nEgan et al., 2007a); introducing the compressed working week;(Bambra et al., 2008a) or \nimplementing some other structural changes to shift work (Bambra et al., 2008b) could be \nbeneficial to health and wellbeing and may also have the potential to reduce health \ninequalities.     \n \n \nStudy strengths and limitations \nThe main challenge was to locate relevant systematic reviews. Searching for reviews of \norganisational workplace interventions is difficult and time-consuming and the searches can \noften suffer from a lack of sensitivity and a lack of specificity (Jackson & Waters, 2004; Ogilvie \net al., 2005). The task of searching is made more difficult because of the lack of a \ncomprehensive register of studies addressing health inequalities. However, to ensure the \nsearches were as extensive as possible, our strategies were piloted and revised. Further, the \nsearches were conducted by an experienced information specialist at the Centre for Reviews \n 19 \nand Dissemination. In addition, leading public health journals were hand searched and review \nauthors were contacted. Despite this, as for any review of complex and difficult-to-define \ninterventions, it is not possible to be sure that all relevant reviews have been located (Ogilvie \net al., 2005). Further, there may of course be older reviews (pre-2000) that might provide \nadditional evidence, although if such reviews exist they may well be out-dated. Another \nimportant limitation relates to the nature of umbrella reviews: there is clearly a risk that bias is \ntransmitted upward from primary studies, to systematic reviews and then to umbrella reviews. \nThis means that ideally the primary studies still need to be consulted in detail. Consequently, \nthis umbrella review provides an overview only of organisational workplace interventions. It \ncannot offer detailed information on practice or implementation.  \n \nCONCLUSION \nSeven systematic reviews of the health effects of organisational level changes to the \npsychosocial work environment were identified. Changes to employee control and wider \npsychosocial changes to the organisation of work were found to have important and generally \nbeneficial effects on health. Some reviews provided evidence which suggests that \norganisational workplace interventions may also have the potential to reduce health \ninequalities amongst the employed, particularly between men and women, and between \nsocio-economic groups. Policy makers should therefore consider organisational level \nworkplace interventions when seeking to improve the health of the working age population. \n 20 \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThe work was undertaken by the authors as part of the Public Health Research Consortium.  \nThe Public Health Research Consortium is funded by the Department of Health Policy \nResearch Programme.
