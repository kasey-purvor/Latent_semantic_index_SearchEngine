Knock-down of EJC components therefore should be\nexpected to have a systemic impact on gene expression, resulting in\nmajor disturbance of plant growth and development. Indeed, RNAi lines\nof several EJC genes have demonstrated strong pleiotropic phenotypes.\nProteomic DIGE analysis indicated large groups of proteins with altered\nlevels of expression in RNAi lines.

Maini (Mathematical Institute, Oxford University)\nThe modelling of cancer provides an enormous mathematical\nchallenge because of its inherent multiscale nature. For example, in\nvascular tumours, nutrient is transported by the vascular system, which\noperates on a tissue level. However, it affects processes occurring on a\nmolecular level. Molecular and intra-cellular events in turn affect the\nvascular network and therefore the nutrient dynamics. Our modelling\napproach is tomodel, using partial differential equations, processes on the\ntissue level and couple these to the intercellular events (modelled by\nordinary differential equations) via cells modelled as automaton units.\nThusfar,within this frameworkwehavemodelled structural adaptation at\nthe vessel level and the effects of growth factor production in response to\nhypoxia. We have also investigated the effects of acid production,\nmutation and phenotypic evolution driven by tissue environment. These\nresults will be presented.\ndoi:10.1016\/j.cbpa.2008.04.027\nCSS.20\nSpatial and temporal information encoding by the NF-\u03baB system\nM. White (Liverpool University); C. Horton (Liverpool University); D.\nNelson (Liverpool University); P. Paszek (Liverpool University); L.\nAshall (Liverpool University); K. Sillitoe (Liverpool University); V. See\n(Liverpool University); D. Spiller (Liverpool University); D. Kell\n(Manchester University); D. Broomhead (Manchester University); D.\nRand (Warwick University); M.R.H. White (Liverpool University)\nSignalling through NF-\u03baB involves its release from an I\u03baB in the\ncytosol, followed by translocation into the nucleus. NF-\u03baB regulation of\nIkBa transcription represents a delayednegative feedback loop that drives\noscillations in NF-\u03baB translocation. Single cell time-lapse imaging and\ncomputational modeling of NF-\u03baB (RelA) localization showed asynchro-\nnous oscillations following cell stimulation that decreased in frequency\nwith increased IkBa transcription. Transcription of target genes depended\non oscillation persistence, involving cycles of RelA phosphorylation and\ndephosphorylation. We used timed stimulation of cells with pulses of\nTumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFa) at differing doses to investigate the\nresponse of the NF-\u03baB system. These studies suggested that the system\nhas a reset time after which a full amplitude pulse of NF-\u03baB nuclear\noccupation is observed when a 5 min pulse of TNFa is applied. Repetitive\npulses at regular intervals leads to synchronous oscillations in the cell\npopulation assisting biochemical analysis for example by Western\nblotting ChIP and analysis of differential target gene expression. These\nstudies confirmed that cyclical phosphorylation occurs at RelA Ser536.\nRefitting of computational models to these data has made predictions\nabout the role of the A20 feedback loop in regulating NF-\u03baB signalling.\nPreviously, we have studied the key canonical pathway proteins RelA and\nI\u03baBa. However, NF\u2013\u03baB signalling involves a further set of negative and\npositive feedback loops, including through I\u03baBe and RelB.We have used a\nstochastic 3 feedback computational model to suggest that noise in I\u03baBe\nexpressionmayhavea role in increasing cell to cell oscillation asynchrony.\ndoi:10.1016\/j.cbpa.2008.04.028\nCSS.21\nTo be confirmed\nM.

Gaouar, A. Benmansour (Department of Biology,\nUniversity Of Abou Bekr Belkaid-Tlemcen, Algeria)\nTyrosinase frommushrooms (Agaricus bisporus (J.E.Lange) Imbach)\nwas partially purified and characterized. The enzyme exhibited both\nmonophenolase and diphenolase activities that were measured\nspectrophotometrically using L-tyrosine and pyrogallol as substrates.\nA two-fold purification in both activities was achieved by ammonium\nsulfate fractionation. Themonophenolase activity was 3.35 EU\/ml, and\nthe diphenolase activity was 189.3 EU\/ml. Tyrosinase was relatively\nstable at \u221215 \u00b0C for 44 days. The enzyme was not very heat stable, and\nits activity decreased when incubated at the temperatures higher than\n35 \u00b0C. Tyrosinase activity showed two pH optima, at 5.3 and 7.0 at 25 \u00b0\nC when pyrogallol was used as the substrate. Mono-, di- and\ntriphenols were substrates for tyrosinase. Using Vmax\/Km as a\nspecificity constant, pyrocatechol was the better substrate followed\nby pyrogallol. The kinetic parameters of the enzyme were:\nVmax=78 EU\/min\/ml, Km=1.4 Mm and KS=250 mM for pyrogallol\nand Vmax=168 EU\/min\/ml, Km=0.40 mM and KS=270 mM for the\npyrocatechol. Of the inhibitors tested, competitivetype inhibition was\nobserved with benzoic acid and sodium azide. A mixed-type\ninhibition was observed with L-cysteine and sodium fluoride.\ndoi:10.1016\/j.cbpa.2008.04.030\nCSS.23\nAnoxia resistance in vertebrates: Metabolomics of brains and\nheart that never stop\nI.
