Results  from \ngeomorphological mapping, lithostratigraphic investigations, three-dimensional geological modelling \nand  field  observations  are  combined  to  produce  an  empirically  constrained,  five-stage  conceptual \nmodel of  ice sheet  evolution.  (A) Previously published dates on interstadial  organic deposits  and \nmammalian fossils suggest that the Main Late Devensian (MLD) (MIS 2) glaciation of central Scotland \nbegan after 35 ka cal BP.  During build-up, ice advanced from the western Scottish Highlands into the \nClyde and Ayrshire basins.  Glaciomarine muds and shelly deposits scavenged from the Firth of Clyde \nwere redeposited widely as shelly tills and glacial rafts.  Ice advance against reverse slopes generated, \nand subsequently overtopped,  ice-marginal  sediment accumulations.   We hypothesise that  some of \nthese formed pre-cursor ridges which were moulded into suites of ribbed moraine during the glacial \ncycle.  (B) Sustained stadial conditions at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) (c. 30 - 25 ka cal BP) \nresulted in development of a major dispersal centre over the Firth of Clyde and Southern Uplands.  This \ndispersal centre locally preserved previously-formed subglacial bedforms, and fed a wide corridor of \nfast-flowing ice east towards the Firth of Forth.  (C) Initial deglaciation promoted a substantial re-\nconfiguration of the ice surface, with enhanced westward drawdown into the outer Firth of Clyde and \neastward  migration  of  an  ice  divide  towards  the  Clyde-Forth  watershed.   (D)  Renewed ice  sheet \nthickening over the Firth of Clyde may have accompanied growth of the Irish Ice Sheet during the \nKillard  Point  Stadial  (c.  17.1 -  15.2 cal  ka  BP);  it  was  associated  with  limited  bed modification. \nSubsequent  ice  sheet  retreat  was  characterised  by  substantial  meltwater  production,  ponding  and \nerosion.

Introduction\nDetailed  geomorphological  investigations,  aided  by  increasingly  powerful  remote  sensing \ndatasets,  have  revealed  complex  flow  signatures  from former  ice  sheets  (e.g.  Clark  and \nStokes, 2001; De Angelis and Kleman, 2007; McCabe, 2008; Greenwood and Clark, 2009a). \nSuch evidence is essential in order to test and refine numerically-driven ice sheet models, \nwhich can simulate dynamic cycles and major ice flow configuration changes (e.g. Boulton \nand Hagdorn, 2006; Hubbard et al., 2009).  The last British and Irish Ice Sheet (BIIS) is now \nknown to have undergone substantial  changes  in  geometry and flow during its  evolution \n(Bowen et al., 2002; Bradwell et al., 2008; Evans et al, 2009; Greenwood and Clark, 2009b). \nHowever, terrestrial evidence is fragmentary, and coherent, time transgressive reconstructions \nare lacking for many key sectors.  Interpretations conflict  owing to the isolated nature of \nindividual studies, and uncertainty remains over whether events identified in the geological \nrecord were local phenomena resulting from internal glacier readjustments, or ice sheet-wide \nevents controlled by climatic response (e.g. Sissons, 1964, 1976; Paterson, 1974; McCabe et \nal., 2007b; Peacock et al., 2007).   \nThis study attempts to address these issues for west central Scotland (Figs 1, 2) - an area of \nsome 3700 km2 which was subjected to interactions between major accumulation zones of the \nlast  BIIS.   By  combining  geomorphological,  lithostratigraphical,  and  three-dimensional \ngeological modelling investigations with existing research, we reassess the palaeoglaciology \nof this formerly dynamic ice sheet zone.  Specifically, this paper aims to: (i) identify evidence \nfor  spatially  and  temporally  variable  ice  flow  patterns,  major  geometry  changes,  and \noscillatory events that accompanied build up and decay of the BIIS in west central Scotland; \n(ii) take account of published evidence from surrounding areas to test for indicators of more \nwidespread ice sheet reorganisation(s); (iii) provide a coherent, conceptual model of ice sheet \nevolution for this zone of the last BIIS; and (iv) enable better understanding of the three-\ndimensional distribution of glacigenic, glaciolacustrine and glaciomarine sediments beneath \ngreater Glasgow required for applied geological investigations.\n2. Background\nThis section reviews the key published evidence relating to the Main Late Devensian (MLD) \nice sheet glaciation of west central Scotland.  In this paper, dates are quoted in radiocarbon \nyears and calibrated to calendar years before present where appropriate, using the curves of \nStuiver et al. (2005) and Fairbanks et al. (2005).  Radiocarbon ages from marine samples are \nquoted assuming a 400-year reservoir age correction, except where indicated otherwise.    \n2\n45\n50\n55\n60\n65\n70\n75\n80\nThe  western  central  lowlands  of  Scotland  have  been  recognised  as  an  area  affected  by \ncomplex ice-flow patterns since J. Geikie (1863) described it as the \u201cdebatable ground over \nwhich glaciers of the Highlands or Southern Uplands (Fig. 1) prevailed according to their \ncontemporary  strengths\u201d.   Highland-sourced  ice  initially  extended  south-eastwards  to  the \nnorthern flanks of the Southern Uplands as suggested by the distribution of indicator erratics \nand  the  widespread  occurrence  of  \u2018lower\u2019  tills  of  north-western  provenance  underlying \n\u2018upper\u2019 tills derived from the south (Price, 1975; Sutherland and Gordon, 1993).  Southern \nUplands ice became more dominant later, deflecting Highland ice both to the east and south-\nwest. The easterly diverted flow left a strong imprint on the landscape of the Clyde basin, in \nthe form of extensive, drumlin assemblages (Rose, 1987; Hall et al., 1998; Rose and Smith, \n2008).  \nFormer  changes  in  ice  flow direction are  particularly  apparent  in  central  Ayrshire  where \nevidence from erratics, stratigraphy, cross-cutting striae and roches mouton\u00e9es demonstrate \nthat  ice  firstly  flowed onshore  towards  the  south-east  and  then offshore  south-westwards \n(Richey et al., 1930).  Highland-sourced ice initially penetrated at least as far south as Nith \nBridge (Fig. 2), carrying shells that were probably scavenged from the Firth of Clyde (Holden \nand Jardine, 1980; Sutherland, 1993). This early, on-shore flow of ice resulted in widespread \ndeposition of shelly tills and rafts of glaciomarine clay, notably at Afton Lodge and Greenock \nMains (Fig. 2) (Smith, 1898; Holden, 1977; Abd-Alla, 1988; Gordon, 1993a,b). Evidence for \na  later,  onshore  readvance  of  Highland-sourced  ice  at  the  latter  locality  (Holden,  1977) \nimplies that active ice occupied the Firth of Clyde and Ayrshire Lowlands after the eastern \ncentral lowlands had deglaciated (Sutherland, 1984).\nMost evidence for these switches in flow relates to the last, MLD glaciation when the BIIS is \nthought to have reached the continental shelf edge to the north-west of the British Isles and \nmerged with ice from Fennoscandia in the North Sea Basin (Graham et al., 2007; Bradwell et \nal.,  2008).  However,  there  is  an  unusually  high  concentration  of  mammalian  fossil \noccurrences and other organic remains within glacigenic sequences that have survived the \nMLD glaciation, particularly in the Ayrshire Lowlands and the lower Clyde valley (Bishop \nand Coope, 1977; Sutherland and Gordon, 1993). Early age determinations from bones of \nwoolly  rhinoceros  from  Bishopbriggs  (Rolfe,  1966)  and  reindeer  antler  fragments  from \nSourlie (Fig. 2) (Jardine et al., 1988) yielded ages of c. 27 -30 ka 14C BP.  A revised age of \n31.1 ka  14C BP (c. 35 ka cal BP) has recently been published for the Bishopbriggs sample, \nfollowing  ultrafiltration  pre-treatment  (Jacobi  et  al.,  2009).  This  age  is  similar  to  those \nobtained from organic remains within fully investigated interstadial profiles beneath till at \nBalglass (Fig.1) (Brown et al., 2007) and Sourlie (Bos et al., 2004).  Collectively, these dates \n3\n85\n90\n95\n100\n105\n110\n115\nsuggest that the MLD ice sheet did not become established in the area until after c. 35 ka cal \nBP, contrary to the conclusions of Bowen et al.  (2002) .   However, numerical modelling \nexperiments simulate minor glacial advances into the area prior to the main sustained advance \nin the Late Devensian (Hubbard et al., 2009). Indeed, the moderately-weathered Lawthorn \nDiamicton that underlies the interstadial deposits at Sourlie, and the Ballieston Till Formation \n(see below), which occurs within concealed depressions beneath Glasgow, must relate to an \nearlier expansion of glacier ice. \nThere is general agreement that the MLD ice sheet withdrew towards the west and northwest \nduring deglaciation of the area (Price, 1983; Sutherland, 1984). Ice-marginal lakes formed \nwhere ice impeded drainage, firstly on the watershed between the catchments of the Avon \nWater and River Irvine, in Glengavel (Fig. 2), where laminated glaciolacustrine silts occur to \nan elevation of at least 205 m above sea level (a.s.l.) (Nickless et al., 1978). This lake came \ninto  existence  shortly  after  Highland  and  Southern  Uplands-sourced  ice  had  separated \n(Phemister  in Richey, 1926; McLellan, 1969; Martin, 1981). Water held within the upper \nAvon  Valley  merged  with  a  much  larger  lake,  \u2018Lake  Clydesdale\u2019  (Bell,  1874),  which \neventually occupied the Clyde valley and its tributaries upstream of Glasgow. The level of \nLake Clydesdale probably dropped in stages as north-westward retreat of the ice margin in the \nlower Clyde Valley made available spillways to the east at progressively lower elevations of \n200, 165, 102, and 85m a.s.l. respectively (Paterson et al., 1998, fig. 12). The lake finally \ndrained eastwards via a col in the upper Kelvin valley at about 45 m a.s.l. (Forsyth et al., \n1996; Hall et al., 1998). \nLake Clydesdale probably existed during the creation of the Main Perth Shoreline in the Forth \nestuary (Sissons and Smith, 1965; Sutherland, 1984), and possibly into the beginning of the \nLateglacial Interstadial (GI-1) (Peacock, 1999, 2003).  The timing, contemporary sea level \nand manner in which the late-glacial sea eventually invaded Lake Clydesdale is disputed (see \nPeacock, 2003 for review), but it is generally accepted that the transgression had occurred by \n13.1 - 12.514C ka BP (based on uncorrected, reported ages from marine shells) (Peacock, \n1971,  2003;  Peacock et  al.,  1977;  Browne et  al.,  1977;  Rose,  2003).   The presence of a \nradiocarbon plateau at  this  time,  and uncertainty regarding the reservoir  correction at  the \nGreenland Stadial-2 (GS-2) to GI-1 boundary, preclude a more precise chronology based on \n14C dates  alone  (Peacock,  2003).   Final  disintegration  of  ice  blocking  the  Clyde  estuary \nresulted  in  the  level  of  Lake  Clydesdale  falling  from  45  m  to  no  less  than  40  m,  the \ncontemporary sea level (Peacock, 2003). Sea level then fell rapidly, but further discussion of \nthe subsequent, complex sea-level history of the area is not presented here, nor discussion of \nevents during the Loch Lomond Stadial (Greenland Stadial-1, GS-1), when ice readvanced \n4\n120\n125\n130\n135\n140\n145\n150\nfrom the Loch Lomond basin to the northwest of Glasgow (Rose et al., 1988; Evans, 2003; \nRose and Smith, 2008). \n3. Lithostratigraphy of west central Scotland\nDespite the success of modern geomorphological analysis in distiguishing the relative ages of \nlandforms, it is essential also to consider the known sequence of deposits (lithostratigraphy) \nin order to determine a robust event stratigraphy. Detailed lithostratigraphical knowledge also \nunderpins sophisticated three-dimensional modelling of Quaternary deposits (e.g. J.E. Merritt \net al., 2007). The lithostratigraphy for the Clyde and Ayrshire basins presented here (Fig 3) \ndevelops  that  of  Sutherland (1999)  and  follows  a  new top-down,  nationwide  framework \n(McMillan et al., 2005, in press; www.bgs.ac.uk\/lexicon).\nThe  Clyde  lithostratigraphy  is  based  on  formations  proposed  by  Rose  (1981,  1989)  and \nBrowne  and  McMillan  (1989a).  The  lowermost  Ballieston  Till  Formation consists  of \nconsolidated sandy silty clay diamicton with isolated boulders and pebbles. It is dark greyish \nbrown at  depth,  but reddish brown at  the surface possibly due to weathering (oxidation). \nSections in the till revealed numerous joints, many of which were striated and polished on \ntheir  surfaces.   Boreholes  and temporary sections from Glasgow revealed up to 15 m of \nconsolidated,  laminated,  unfossiliferous,  silty  glaciolacustrine  clays  with  dropstones \n(Broomhill Clay Formation) overlying the Ballieston Till (Browne and McMillan, 1989a). \nThese authors suggested that the laminations are varves, representing 600 - 1000 years of \nsedimentation.  Importantly, these glaciolacustrine clays occur to depths of c. 25 m below \npresent sea level, requiring a low contemporary sea level at the time of deposition.  Where \nobserved, the Broomhill Clay is overlain by the regional till of the area, the Wilderness Till \nFormation.   However, in parts of northern Glasgow, the latter rests on bedded, bouldery \ngravelly sands of the Cadder Sand Formation.  These sands have yielded bones and teeth of \nwoolly rhinoceros, (Rolfe, 1966).  The Wilderness Till is described by Rose et al. (1988) as a \ndefomation till, but it also includes tectonised thrust slices of sand and laminated clay from \nunderlying units.  In Glasgow, it is a sandy silty clay diamicton with pebbles and isolated \nboulders.  The colour varies, depending on local bedrock.  In eastern Glasgow the Wilderness \nTill is overlain by the Broomhouse Sand and Gravel Formation, much of which forms ice-\ncontact topography (eskers, mounds, flat-topped kames and kettleholes).  These deposits have \nbeen  extensively  removed  for  aggregate.   The  Broomhouse  Sand  and  Gravel  Formation \nincludes deltaic sands and glaciolacustrine laminated clays (Ross Sand and  Bellshill Clay \nmembers,  respectively),  which  were  deposited  in  an  ice-dammed  lake,  \u2018Glacial  Lake \nClydesdale\u2019 (Bell, 1874), whilst the MLD ice sheet margin retreated from the position of \neastern Glasgow.  \n55\n155\n160\n165\n170\n175\n180\n185\n190\nIn west central Scotland, raised glaciomarine deposits of late-glacial age are assigned to the \nClyde  Clay Formation  (McMillan  et  al.,  in  press)  in  which  two principle  members  are \nrecognised, the Paisley Clay and Linwood Clay.  The former member generally comprises \nthinly laminated clays and silts with dropstones.  This member is generally poor in fauna, \nonly yielding the cold-water foraminifera Elphidium clavatum in significant numbers.  It has \nbeen mapped in areas around the Clyde estuary up to altitudes of c. 40 m a.s.l. (Browne and \nMcMillan, 1989a).  The Linwood Clay Member is confined to western areas of the Clyde \nestuary where it commonly overlies the Paisley Clay.  It consists of more thickly bedded silts \nand clays  with a  richer faunal  assemblage.  (e.g.  Browne and McMillan,  1989a;  Peacock, \n2003).\n A gravelly silty clay diamicton, the Gartocharn Till Formation, occurs around the southern \nshores  of  Loch Lomond,  locally  including  marine foraminifera  and broken marine shells \nentrained by erosion of  units  from the Clyde Clay Formation (Rose et  al.,  1988).   Plant \ndetritus found beneath the Gartocharn Till has been radiocarbon dated at 10.6 14C ka BP (c. \n12.5 cal  ka BP) (Rose et  al.,  1988),  confirming that  the  till  was deposited as glacier  ice \nreadvanced during the Loch Lomond Stadial (GS-1).    \n           \nThe Quaternary lithostratigraphy of central Ayrshire follows McMillan et al. (in press) and is \nbased mainly on the succession that was exposed in an opencast coal site at Sourlie, near \nIrvine (Fig. 2) (Jardine et al., 1988; Sutherland, 1999).  The site was excavated into the north-\nwestern side of Sourlie Hill, one of a swarm of broadly eastward orientated drumlins. The \nimportance of the site lay in the discovery of thin lenses of organic material (Sourlie Organic \nSilt Formation) occurring between two units of till. These lenses yielded a very rich flora \nand fauna deposited within a shallow pond in a treeless,  low-shrub to sedge-moss tundra \nenvironment, and included bones of woolly rhinoceros and reindeer. Radiocarbon dates on \nantler fragments, plant debris and bulk organic matter suggest a Middle Devensian age (Bos \net al., 2004). \nThe basal unit comprises up to 7.5 m of very stiff, dark grey, silty sandy stony clay diamicton \n('lodgement till'),  the  Littlestone Till  Formation,  which locally encloses deformed sheets \n(glacial rafts?) of sand up to 7.5 m thick. The till is overlain by up to 3.5 m of unstratified, \nclay-rich  gravel  and  clayey  sand  (Lawthorn  Diamicton  Member  of  the  Littlestone  Till \nFormation), interpreted as an 'ablation deposit' by Jardine et al. (1988), but probably better \ndescribed today as glacigenic debris flow deposits.  The Lawthorn Diamicton is overlain by \n6\n195\n200\n205\n210\n215\n220\n225\nup to 5.5 m of the partially cross-stratified Armsheugh Sand and Gravel Formation that is \ninterpreted by Jardine et al. (1988) to have formed as glaciofluvial outwash.  The Middle \nDevensian Sourlie Organic Silt Formation occupies shallow depressions within the surface of \nthe sand and gravel.  The organic deposits are overlain by up to 3.5 m of pinkish brown, very \nstiff, pebbly sandy silty clay diamicton containing clasts of local sandstone, mudstone, coal \nand dolerite, \u2018far travelled sedimentary, igneous and metamorphic rocks\u2019 and shell fragments, \nincluding sparse paired valves of marine molluscs yielding Late Devensian amino acid ratios \n(Jardine et al., 1988). This unit, the  Eglinton Shelly Till Member of the Wilderness Till \nFormation, is correlated here with other widespread occurrences of shelly till  in Ayrshire \n(Smith,  1898;  Sutherland and  Gordon,  1993),  that  elsewhere  contains  rafts  of  cold-water \nmarine silts and clays, notably at Afton Lodge, near Ayr (Gordon, 1993a).  The uppermost \nglacigenic  unit  at  Sourlie  comprises  up  to  12  m of  stiff,  dark  grey  \u2018lodgement  till\u2019,  the \nAuchenwinsey Till Member of the Wilderness Till Formation.  It forms most of the drumlin \ninto which the opencast site was excavated. \n4. Methods\n4.1. Remote sensing evidence\nRemote sensing datasets were interrogated within ESRI Arc Map 9.2. Digital surface models \n(DSMs) and georectified 1:10,000 monoscopic aerial photographs were analysed to identify \nglacial landforms in the study area.  The surface models,  built  from NEXTMap\u00ae Britain \ntopographic data (1.5 m vertical and 5 m horizontal resolution) were illuminated from the NW \nand NE to ensure capture of landforms with differing alignments.  The DSM was analysed at \nseveral scales, ranging from 1:10,000 to 1:200,000.  During larger-scale analyses, horizontal \nresolution  was  reduced  to  50  m.   Within  the  Glasgow  area  two  additional  versions  of \nelevation data were used.  One was a hill-shaded digital terrain model (DTM), for which data \nare processed to smooth abrupt surface features (e.g.  buildings) allowing clearer  (but less \naccurate) visualisation of the ground surface.  The second was the unprocessed, orthorectified \nradar data, which was effective in picking out glacial landforms within built up areas.  \n4.2. Three-dimensional geological evidence\nOver 60,000 borehole records exist  for  Glasgow and the surrounding area.    The British \nGeological Survey (BGS) is currently creating a suite of three-dimensional Quaternary and \nbedrock models, based on the borehole data (J.E. Merritt et al., 2005; J.E. Merritt et al., 2007) \nusing the modelling software tool, GSI3D (Sobisch, 2000; Kessler et al., 2006).  In this study, \noutputs from these three-dimensional geological models were used for two purposes: (i) to \nconfirm the basic composition of landforms, thereby enabling more confident discrimination \nbetween  true  glaciogenic  features  and  bedrock  controlled  features;  and  (ii)  to  aid \n7\n230\n235\n240\n245\n250\n255\n260\ninterpretation and identification in areas where subglacial landforms are masked by younger \ndeposits (Fig. 4), or modified at surface due to urban development.  A comprehensive UK \ndatabase containing borehole records (BGS Borehole Geology) was interrogated throughout \nthe investigation to provide additional information about the surface and subsurface sediments \nin the mapping area.  \n4.3 Field evidence\nThe greater Clyde basin area was resurveyed in the field at 1:10,000 scale over a 5 year \nperiod  in  the  1980s.   The  programme  also  included  investigation  of  sedimentological, \ngeotechnical and palaeontological characteristics of sixteen cored boreholes, and studies from \nnumerous  temporary sections.  This  work  resulted in  production  of  Quaternary geological \nmaps of  the  region (Browne and McMillan,  1989b).   These  field  data  provide important \nconstraints for the work presented here.\n4.4 Data compilation \nAll  landforms  and  mapped  sediment  distributions  were  captured  in  a  spatially  attributed \nArcGIS\u00a9 database.   Landforms  mapped  include:  ribbed  moraine,  streamlined  bedforms, \nmeltwater  channels,  moraine  ridge  complexes  and  narrow  transverse  ridges.  Existing \nQuaternary geological maps of the area (e.g. British Geological Survey, 1987, 1993a, 1993b, \n2002;  Browne  and  McMillan,  1989b)  were  consulted  throughout  the  study.   A  recently \ncompiled  2-D  digital  geological  map  of  Britain  at  1:50:000  scale  (DiGMapGB 50)  was \ninterrogated in the GIS and forms the basis for mapped distributions of glaciofluvial, deltaic, \nand raised marine sediments, and areas where bedrock occurs at or near the surface.  \n5. Results\nA glacial geological and geomorphological map of the greater Clyde basin is shown in Figure \n5.  Some detail is lost reproducing the map at this scale, and numerous smaller features such \nas minor meltwater channels and individual moraine crests, are not shown. It is intended that \na  detailed,  larger  format  glacial  geological  and  geomorphological  map  will  be  available \nelsewhere.   The  morphological,  spatial  and,  where  known,  basic  sedimentological \ncharacteristics of landform assemblages are described below. \n5.1. Ribbed moraine:\nSuites  of  southwest  to  northeast  aligned,  broad  transverse  ridges  occupy  the  Clyde  and \nAyrshire basins up to an elevation of c. 200 m a.s.l.  These ridges are 0.4-1.2 km in width, \n0.4-6.5 km in length and up to 40 m in height.  On a morphological basis, the ridges can be \ndescribed as ribbed moraine, and their dimensions are entirely consistent with those reported \n8\n265\n270\n275\n280\n285\n290\n295\n300\nby  Dunlop  and  Clark  (2006).  Occupying  areas  principally  underlain  by  Carboniferous \nsedimentary rocks and basalts, the ribbed moraine maintain a long-axis alignment that does \nnot concord with variations in bedrock strike.   Three-dimensional geological models (e.g. \nFig. 4) in the Clyde basin indicate that these ridges commonly consist of glacial sediments \nassigned to the Wilderness Till Fm; thus their form is not considered to be controlled by \nbedrock structure.   \nThe ribbed moraine are extensively remoulded with development of, or modification into, \nelongate streamlined bedforms (described below).  A 50-m-long temporary section within a \nbroader zone of drumlinised ribbed moraine ridges was described by McMillan and Browne \n(1983) and Browne and McMillan (1989a).   Here, a 2- to 5-m thick surface carapace of red-\nbrown sandy clayey till of the Wilderness Till Fm sharply truncates a series of underlying \nsediments (Fig. 6). The lower sediments comprise till, bedded gravels, sands and clay, and \nform a series of thrust slices dipping steeply westwards.  Two normal faults occur in these \nlower sediments, on the western side of the thrust stack. \n5.2. Streamlined bedforms:\nStreamlined bedforms are well developed within the Clyde and Ayrshire basins, around the \nmargins of the Southern Uplands, and to the southeast of the Lochwinnoch Gap (Figs. 2, 5). \nIn the latter area they occur where till is thin and patchy, and locally are strike parallel to the \ngently dipping Clyde Plateau Volcanic Formation.  In that locality, bedforms are probably \ninfluenced by bedrock structure.  Cover of Quaternary sediments is much thicker over the \nbasins to  the north and south,  which are  underlain mainly by Carboniferous  sedimentary \nrocks.   That  bedforms  in  the  Clyde  Basin  are  of  glacial  origin  is  supported  by  three-\ndimensional geological models, which show that the landforms principally consist of glacial \nsediments assigned to the Wilderness Till Fm (Fig. 4).  Many of the streamlined bedforms in \nthe basins are superimposed on, or consist of, re-shaped sections of the ribbed moraine (Fig. \n7).  \nNumerous geomorphologically-based ice sheet reconstructions use the approach of grouping \nbedforms into coherent \u2018flowsets\u2019 or \u2018swarms\u2019 (e.g. Boulton and Clark, 1990; De Angelis and \nKleman, 2007; Stokes et al., 2009; Greenwood and Clark, 2009a).  The streamlined bedforms \nidentified  here  can  be  broadly  divided  into  six  flowsets  based  on  their  geographical \ndistribution,  trend,  morphology  and  spatial  relationships  with  other  geomorphological \nfeatures (Fig 8, Table 1):\n5.2.1. Flowset I\n9\n305\n310\n315\n320\n325\n330\n335\nStreamlined bedforms assigned to flowset-I comprise a suite of drumlins trending towards the \neast and east-northeast, and are generally confined to the northeast side of the River Clyde. \nThey have a mean length of 826 m, and a mean elongation ratio (ER) of 3.7.  Bedforms in this \ngroup have been described previously by Rose (1987) and Rose and Smith (2008).   \n5.2.2. Flowset II\nStreamlined  bedforms  assigned  to  flowset-II  comprise  a  more  subdued  assemblage  of \ndrumlins trending towards the north and north-northeast.  These bedforms curve along the \nnorthwest margins of the Southern Uplands, showing a very slight divergence at the elevated \nground to the north of Greenock Mains.  They are distinct from flowset-I on the basis of \nshorter length (mean: 563 m) and of lower ERs (mean 2.9).  Flowset-II tentatively includes \ntwo similarly aligned, but more isolated streamlined bedforms to the northeast of Corse Hill. \n5.2.3. Flowset III\nFlowset III comprises ice-moulded bedrock and crag-and-tail forms over higher elevations \nand drumlins in the lower basin areas.  They are well-preserved, and trend in a south to west-\nnorthwest direction, forming an overall convergent pattern towards the southwest (Fig. 8). \nSubsets (III-a \u2013 III-e) are identifiable within flowset-III on the basis of slight variations in \nalignment and differences in morphological characteristics.  For example, subsets III-b and \nIII-c have a considerably longer mean length (> 1 km) (Table 1).   This probably reflects \nthinner till cover, and local concordance with strike of the gently dipping volcanic rocks. \nAlthough  some  of  these  bedforms  may  be  influenced  by  bedrock  structure  over  higher \nelevations,  a  consistent  convergent  trend is  maintained in  the  lower-lying  sediment-filled \nbasins.  The transition between individual  subsets is  largely gradational;  thus,  they are all \nincorporated within flowset-III.\n5.2.4. Flowset IV\nFlowset-IV comprises  a  small  cluster  of  streamlined  bedforms  c.  12  km south  from the \nBlantyreferme  Moraine  (see  below).   These  bedforms  trend  in  an  east  to  east-southeast \ndirection.   They possess  the shortest  lengths  (mean 321 m) of all  the  flowsets  identified \n(Table 1).   \n5.2.5. Flowset V\nFlowset-V comprises a well-defined suite of streamlined bedforms trending towards the east. \nThey are generally confined to the western side of the Kilmarnock Moraine Belt (Fig 8) (see \nbelow);  only a  few isolated bedforms occur  on the  immediate  eastern side.   Streamlined \nbedforms belonging to flowset-V overprint those of flowset-III (Figs 8, 9)\n1010\n340\n345\n350\n355\n360\n365\n370\n375\n5.2.6. Flowset VI  \nFlowset  VI  comprises  well-defined drumlins  trending in  a  southeast  direction.   They are \nconfined to the Clyde basin, and extend eastward as far as the Blantyreferme Moraine (see \nbelow).  Overprinting of flowset-VI bedforms onto the generally longer flowset-I bedforms is \napparent in parts of the Clyde basin, a characteristic described by Rose and Letzer (1977) and \nRose and Smith (2008).    \n5.3. Glaciofluvial assemblages:\nGlaciofluvial assemblages described here include both moundy, kettled, ice-contact deposits \nand terraced outwash spreads, both assigned to the Broomhouse Sand and Gravel Formation. \nIt is worthy of note that glaciofluvial deposits portrayed on BGS maps may include deltaic \nsequences  that  formed  in  ice-marginal  or  proglacial  lakes;  only  widespread,  fine-grained \ndeposits are generally identified as \u2018glaciolacustrine\u2019. Major belts of glaciofluvial deposits \noccur principally in the valleys of the Clyde, Kelvin and Avon (British Geological Survey, \n1993a, 1993b, 1994). Many of the deposits in the southeast of the area are associated with \nsystems of north-easterly-descending ice-marginal meltwater channels, notably southeast of \nEaglesham and south of Strathaven (Richey et al., 1930; Paterson et al., 1998), where they fall \nfrom about 320 to 260 m a.s.l. (Fig. 10A). Further significant belts of mounds and undulating \nspreads  of  sand  and  gravel  occur  in  the  upper  Ayr  and  Nith  valleys  (British  Geological \nSurvey, 1982).  These deposits  are also associated with coherent  systems of ice-marginal \nmeltwater channels, which in the upper Ayr valley descend from about 300 to 250 m a.s.l. \ntowards the east.   Further sets of eastward descending marginal meltwater channels exist in \nthe Nith valley at altitudes from about 300 m down to 200 m a.s.l.  \n5.4. Moraine ridge complexes:\nThree major moraine complexes have been identified in the Ayrshire and Clyde basins, at \nKilmarnock,  Blantyreferme  and  Eaglesham  respectively  (Figs.  2,  5).   The  Kilmarnock \nMoraine Belt (KMB, Fig. 5) extends for approximately 14 km in a south-southwest to north-\nnortheast direction, and ranges from 5 to 20 m in height.  To the northeast of Kilmarnock, the \nbelt reaches a maximum width of nearly 800 m, where it forms multiple crests.  Borehole \nrecords indicate that at least part of the complex comprises clay and sandy clay, while records \nimmediately northwest  of  the ridge reveal  till  interbedded with sandy clay.    Flat  terrain \nimmediately southeast of the complex is underlain by up to 7 m of sands, laminated silts and \nclays.\n11\n380\n385\n390\n395\n400\n405\n410\nThe  Blantyreferme  Moraine  (BM,  Fig.  5)  was  first  recognised  by  Clough  et  al.  (1911). \nForming  a  near-symmetrical,  cross-valley  ridge,  it  is  aligned  south-southwest  to  north-\nnortheast extending for over 2 km, and reaching nearly 20 m in height.  Field mapping has \nrevealed the feature to be of variable lithology, comprising till,  sand and gravel and also \nlaminated clay and silt (Browne and McMillan, 1989a).   \nThe Chapelton Moraine Belt (CMB, Fig. 5) comprises a string of ridges and mounds that lie \nto the east of Eaglesham on the northern slopes of Corse Hill (Richey et al., 1930; Paterson et \nal., 1998).  These landforms, which include esker fragments, were formed at the southern \nmargin of Highland-sourced ice early in the deglaciation of the area. They descend eastwards \nfrom about 305 to 260m a.s.l. and were described by Sissons (1963, 1964, 1967a) as part of \nhis more widespread evidence for the supposed \u2018Perth Readvance\u2019 (Simpson, 1933).\nA further,  near-coherent  chain  of  moraine  ridges  occurs  in  the  upper  Ayr  valley,  above \nGreenock Mains. Individual ridges, up to 250 m in length, extend from c. 4 km north of \nGreenock Mains eastward for c. 8 km, declining in altitude from 310 to 270 m a.s.l.  Suites of \neastward declining, marginal meltwater channels occur on the northern and southern flanks of \nthe upper Ayr valley, at altitudes of about 305 to 270 m a.s.l.  Those on the northern side \nmerge with the moraine ridges to the north of Greenock Mains (Fig. 10B).   \n5.5. Glaciolacustrine assemblages:\nExtensive spreads of  fine-grained glaciolacustrine  sediment of  the Bellshill  Clay Member \noccur at surface southeast and east of the Blantyreferme Moraine (Fig. 5).  Glaciolacustrine \nsediments also crop out  locally  on the  western flanks  of  the  Kelvin valley (Browne and \nMcMillan, 1989a; Hall et al., 1988) and along the margins of the Irvine valley downstream of \nDarvel (Nickless et al., 1978).\nThe glaciolacustrine assemblages in the Clyde basin commonly pass up and laterally into flat-\ntopped, deltaic deposits of the Ross Sand Member (Browne and McMillan, 1989a; Martin, \n1981).   Formerly  exposed  sections  revealed  sands  and  gravelly  sands  forming  dipping \nforesets of Gilbert-type deltas (Fig 11, A and B).  The deltaic deposits locally exceed 20 m in \nthickness in the eastern Clyde basin (Browne and McMillan, 1989a).   \n5.6. Narrow transverse ridges:\nTwo suites of previously unreported, closely spaced, narrow, linear transverse ridges occupy \nparts of the lower Irvine valley (Fig. 12) and the southern entrance to the Lochwinnoch Gap. \nThe former, situated on the western side of the KMB trend broadly from south-southwest to \n12\n415\n420\n425\n430\n435\n440\n445\nnorth-northeast, and the latter trend broadly west to east.  Those in the lower Irvine valley \noccur between about 30 m and 150 m a.s.l., while those south of the Lochwinnoch Gap lie \nbetween about 35 m and 140 m a.s.l.   The former have a mean width of 75 m, a mean height \nof 2.4 m, and generally possess a symmetrical cross-profile (Fig. 13).   Many of the ridges are \ncontinuous for over 400 m, maintaining their alignment across topographic undulations of up \nto 20 m in height. No sections have yet been observed within any of the landforms.  However, \nborehole evidence from the Kilmarnock area demonstrates that surface sediments in the area \nof these narrow ridges comprise silts, sands and till.  In places, the narrow transverse ridges \nare clearly superimposed on streamlined bedforms assigned to flowset V (Fig 12).\n5.7. Raised marine deposits:\nThe lithostratigraphy of raised marine deposits in the Clyde basin has been described above. \nField mapping has identified deposits of the Paisley Clay Member occupying extensive areas \nof the Clyde basin up to c. 40 m a.s.l. (Browne and McMillan, 1989a).  Three-dimensional \ngeological modelling supports the field interpretation and reveals thick spreads of silts and \nclay,  often  partially  masking  the  underlying,  drumlinised  landscape  (Fig.  4).   Further \ndiscussion  of  the  distribution  of  raised  marine  deposits  and  associated  features  is  not \npresented here.      \n6. Interpretation of events in west central Scotland\n6.1. Pre-Late Devensian Glaciation\nEvidence for a pre-Late Devensian, MIS 4 or older glacial advance-retreat cycle has briefly \nbeen discussed in section 2. It led to the deposition of the Ballieston Till Formation in the \nClyde basin, and the Littlestone Till Formation in Ayrshire; it probably involved a substantial \nadvance  of  ice  from the  northwest.  The  apparently  weathered  top  of  the  Ballieston  Till \nsuggests that there was a significant period of exposure before deposition of the overlying, \nglacitectonised, thinly laminated, glaciolacustrine sediments of the Broomhill Clay Formation \nin the Bellshill area (Figure 11C).  \n6.2. Late Devensian Glaciation; Stage A.  (Fig.14A; build-up to LGM)\nIf the laminae in the Broomhill Clay Formation are correctly interpreted as varves, at least \n600 to 1000 years elapsed before emplacement of the overlying Wilderness Till Formation \n(Browne and McMillan, 1989a).  These glaciolacustrine sediments may document ponding \nduring the earliest stages of ice advance into the area.  Their occurrence to depths of 25 m \nbelow present sea level, suggests that at the contemporary relative sea level was at least 25 m \n13\n450\n455\n460\n465\n470\n475\n480\n485\nlower  than  present  because  there  is  no  known barrier  that  could  have  prevented  marine \ninvasion. \nInstances  exist  where  streamlined  bedforms  from each  flowset  are  superimposed  on  the \nribbed moraine ridges (e.g. Fig 7).  Therefore, ridge formation must have occurred prior to the \nearliest phases of preserved streamlining in the study area.  Regional geological evidence (e.g. \nPrice, 1975; Sutherland, 1984; Sutherland and Gordon 1993) (Fig. 15) along with numerical \nice sheet models (Hubbard et al., 2009) indicate that initial MLD ice-sheet advance into the \narea was from the northwest, broadly perpendicular to the ribbed moraine.  We suggest this \nwas the period of ribbed moraine formation (Fig 14A), when the ice front advanced against a \nreverse slope, building (then overtopping) sediment ridges through folding and thrusting of \nproglacial  sediments.  A similar  mechanism is  invoked for the formation of  \u2018cupola hills\u2019 \nelsewhere  (Benn and Clapperton,  2000;  Benn and Evans,  1998).  The sediments  formerly \nexposed at Holmbrae Road in Glasgow (Fig. 6) (McMillan and Browne, 1983) are consistent \nwith this interpretation.  Initial advance lead to thrusting of the gravel, sand and clay beds in \nthe eastern side of the section.  The two normal faults may have been activated during a minor \nice margin retreat, prior to overriding and deposition of the upper (Wilderness) till.    The \nconcept that some ribbed moraine originate as overridden ice marginal moraines has been \nproposed by M\u00f6ller (2006).  However, rigorous investigation of the sediments is required to \ntest this hypothesis for these particular ribbed moraine suites.\nThat  landforms  from  such  an  early  stage  of  glaciation  could  survive  is  supported  by \npreservation  of  Middle  Devensian  deposits  in  the  area,  together  with  the  widespread \noccurrences of shelly diamicton (Eglinton Shelly Till) and glacial rafts of glaciomarine mud \nthat were most likely scavenged from the Firth of Clyde during this early build-up stage. \nTheir survival was probably aided by the development of an ice divide over the Firth of Clyde \nduring  the  LGM  (see  below),  beneath  which  there  was  minimal  subglacial  landscape \nmodification.\n6.3. Late Devensian Glaciation; Stage B.  (Fig.14B; LGM)\nThe drumlins of flowset-I must have begun to form after ice in the Clyde basin had become \nsufficiently thick to over-top the main Clyde-Forth drainage divide, allowing fast, essentially \nnon-topographically  constrained  ice  flow  beyond.   A  significant  dispersal  centre  had \ndeveloped over the Southern Uplands had occurred by this stage, contributing to deflection of \nice in the Clyde basin toward the east, as evidenced by the well documented Dubawnt-type \ntrain (cf. Dyke and Morris, 1988) of essexite erratics that were dispersed from their source \n14\n490\n495\n500\n505\n510\n515\n520\nnear Lennoxtown (Fig. 15) into the Firth of Forth (Peach, 1909: Shakesby, 1978, Evans et al., \n2005). Striae patterns (Paterson et al., 1998) (Fig. 5) also document this flow.  \nStreamlined bedforms belonging to flowset-II were formed by north-eastward flow towards \nthe Firth of Forth, driven by thicker ice to the southwest.  This flow would have deposited \nSouthern Upland till, with north-orientated clasts over the lower shelly tills (possibly of the \nEglington  Shelly  Till  Member)  as  described  at  Nith  Bridge  (Holden  and  Jardine,  1980; \nSutherland, 1993) (Fig 16).   \n6.4. Late Devensian Glaciation; Stage C. (Fig.14C)\nStreamlined bedforms from flowset-III document convergent south-westward and westward \nflow into the Firth of Clyde, and are consistent with patterns of glacial striations in the north \nAyrshire basin (Paterson et al., 1998) (Fig. 5).  This evidence suggests that a major change in \nthe ice sheet configuration had occurred, largely caused by drawdown to the west.  Subsets of \nflowset-III  probably  document  a  transgressive  phase  where  part  of  the  Southern  Upland \ndispersal centre was scavenged by this increasing drawdown as ice flowed westward over the \nsouth of Arran.  Westward transportation of Ailsa Craig erratics (Sissons, 1967a) (Fig. 15) \nwould have occurred during this  flow phase.  By this stage, the north-eastward flow that \ngenerated  flowset-II  (Fig  14B  -  see  above)  must  have  switched  off,  allowing  eastward \nmigration of the ice divide, beneath which minimal subglacial modification was occurring.\n6.5. Late Devensian Glaciation; Stage D. (Fig.14D) \nA  further,  substantial  alteration  in  ice  sheet  configuration  and  local  basal  conditions  is \nindicated by the following suite of landforms: limited east-trending streamlining (flowset-IV), \neastward descending marginal meltwater channels, eastward descending suites of ice contact\nglaciofluvial landforms (including the Chapelton Moraine Belt), and minor eastward-pushing \nmorainic assemblages in the Ayr valley.  Collectively, they demonstrate ice-divide migration \nback towards the west, coupled with ice-sheet thickening in the vicinity of the Firth of Clyde. \nThe configuration is roughly that originally proposed for the \u2018Perth Readvance\u2019 in central \nScotland (Sissons, 1963, 1964, 1967b). Of note is the limited bedform development from this \nstage,  with  only  a  small  patch  of  Group  IV  bedforms  occurring  in  the  east.   A  minor \nreadvance is apparent in the Ayr valley near Greenock Mains where a coherent assemblage of \nmeltwater  channels  and  moraine  ridges  indicate  a  late,  north-eastward  push  (Fig.  10B) \n(Holden and Jardine, 1980).\n6.6. Late Devensian Glaciation; Stage E. (Fig.14E) \n1515\n525\n530\n535\n540\n545\n550\n555\nA subsequent phase of more persistent streamlining  is indicated by bedforms assigned to \nflowset-V and VI.   These bedforms are generally longer than those of flowset-IV to the east \n(Table  1).   Abrupt  termination  of  flowset-V  and  VI  just  beyond  (to  the  east  of)  the \nKilmarnock and Blantyreferme moraine complexes demonstrates that the ice flow phase that \ngenerated them extended to these areas.  This flow phase probably included, or was followed \nby ice margin stabilisation at the moraines.  Cross-cutting of drumlins in the Glasgow area \n(e.g. Rose and Letzer, 1977) indicates that cessation of the formation of flowset-I drumlins \nmust have occurred prior to formation of flowset-VI bedforms. \nTo the east of the Kilmarnock and Blantyreferme moraine complexes (which may or may not \nbe contemporaneous features),  vast  suites of  glaciolacustrine and deltaic sediments in the \nClyde and Irvine valleys demonstrate existence of ice-dammed lakes. The narrow, closely-\nspaced  ridges  observed  in  the  Kilmarnock  area  (Figs.  5,  12)  and  to  the  west  of  the \nLochwinnoch Gap (Fig. 5) are similar in morphology to De Geer moraines, which form at, or \nclose to the grounding line of calving glaciers (e.g. Lind\u00e9n and M\u00f6ller, 2005).  The scale of \nthe landforms is consistent with that of De Geer moraines, as is their pattern trending across \ntopographic  undulations  (e.g.  Todd  et  al.,  2007).  Given  the  abundant  evidence  for  ice-\ndammed lakes in the area, and local borehole records of interbedded sands, silts and till, the \nlandforms are interpreted as De Geer moraines. \nA simple estimate of calving speed can be calculated across a hypothetical calving margin \nsimilar to the one indicated by the De Geer moraines at Kilmarnock.  Warren and Kirkbride \n(2003) described an empirical linear relationship between water depth (DW) and calving speed \n(UC) for glaciers terminating in freshwater bodies:\nUC = 17.4 + 2.3DW\nDW can be approximated from the c. 150 m a.s.l. upper altitude of De Geer moraines (proxy \nfor lake surface altitude) and the base of the Ayr valley (30 m a.s.l.).  Assuming a similar \ncalving margin relationship, palaeo-calving rate is calculated to have been 293 m a-1 across \nthe  deepest  part  of  the  lower  Ayr  valley.   Under  steady  state  conditions  (ice  front  not \nretreating, nor advancing), ice velocity at the margin would have been c. 290 m a-1.  These \nvalues are comparable with those of modern glaciers terminating in proglacial lakes on the \neastern  side  of  the  South  Patagonian  Icefield  (e.g.  Warren  and  Aniya,  1999).   Ice  flow \nvelocities  of  this  order  are  consistent  with  the  local  development  of  well-preserved \nstreamlined bedforms assigned to flowset-V (Figs. 5, 8).  The survival, locally, of extended \n16\n560\n565\n570\n575\n580\n585\n590\nDevensian sequences suggests that fast flow was enabled by basal sliding, and a relatively \nthin, near surface deforming layer.\nThe preservation of both pre-MLD sediments and landforms interpreted to have developed \nearly in the MLD glaciation is intriguing.  Both the Clyde and Ayrshire basins lay directly in \nthe path of ice sheet advance, and were subjected to more than one phase of relatively fast \nglacier  flow (described above).   Despite  thick \u2018soft  sediment\u2019  sequences  occupying these \nbasins, it seems unlikely that widespread bed deformation occurred at any one time.  Rather, a \nmosaic (sensu Piotrowski et al., 2004) of deforming and stable spots (characterised by ice-bed \nseparation and basal sliding) is envisaged, enabling some sediment\/landform preservation.   \n7. Towards a regional synthesis\nIn order to put our results into a more regional context (Fig.17) we briefly compare and test \nour deductions with some of those published recently for surrounding segments of the former \nBIIS.  Importantly,  our  history  of  events  for  west  central  Scotland  is  consistent  with  the \nparadigm of a mobile, dynamic BIIS (Bowen et al., 2002; Bradwell et al., 2008; McCabe, \n2008; Evans et al., 2009; Greenwood and Clark, 2009b). \nRecent numerical modelling experiments (Hubbard et al., 2009) simulate initial ice advance \nfrom the northwest into the Clyde and Ayrshire basins, accompanied by independent ice cap \ndevelopment  over  the  Southern  Uplands.   Our  hypothesis  for  pre-cursor  ribbed  moraine \ndevelopment partially through accumulation and over-riding of ice marginal sediments also \nrequires  Southern  Uplands  ice  to  have  remained  a  confined,  independent  mass  while \nnorthwest-sourced ice entered the Clyde and Ayrshire basins(Fig. 14A).  Further support for \nthis early configuration comes from erratic transport paths (Fig 15) where a distinct limit of \nHighland-sourced erratics has been identified (Fig. 5) (Eyles et al., 1949).   Coupling of the \ntwo ice masses is unlikely to have occurred until northwest-sourced ice reached at least the \nsouth-eastern fringes of the Ayrshire basin.  The subsequent development of a substantial ice \ndivide over Arran and the Firth of Clyde with eastward flow across central Scotland by the \nLGM (Fig. 17B) has similarities with a recent reconstruction for northern England (Evans et \nal.,  2009)  in  which ice  sourced  over  southwest  Scotland and the  Lake District  is  driven \neastwards  through  the  Stainmore  and  Tyne  gaps.   Importantly,  there  is  no  evidence  for \neastward  transport  of  Arran  and  Ailsa  Craig  erratics  (Fig.  15),  limiting  the  westernmost \nposition of the ice divide to the vicinity of Arran.         \n17\n595\n600\n605\n610\n615\n620\n625\nThere is no direct evidence to constrain the timing of ice divide migration towards the east \nfollowing the LGM (Fig. 17C). However, there is evidence of post LGM enhanced drawdown \nof ice towards shelf-edge fans on the continental shelf to the northwest (Bradwell et al., 2008) \nand  into  the  Irish  Sea  basin  (Eyles  and  McCabe,  1988;  Roberts  et  al.,  2007).   Our \nreconstruction  of  westward  flow over  the  North  Channel  towards  Ireland  at  this  time  is \nconsistent with the view of Salt and Evans (2004).  Post-LGM, convergent westward flow \nmay have been similar to that of an ephemeral ice stream (cf. Stokes et al., 2009) responding \nto break up and calving offshore to the northwest of Ireland.  This interpretation is consistent \nwith the findings of Greenwood and Clark (2009b) that once the ice sheet was established, \ngeometry was largely controlled by fast flow \/ streaming corridors, which in this instance \nforced the ice divide to the east.     \nThe past two decades have seen considerable advances towards understanding the dynamics \nand deglacial history of the Irish sector of the last BIIS, largely through the work of McCabe \nand co-workers (e.g. Knight and McCabe, 1997; McCabe et al, 1998, 2005, 2007a).  Bedform \npatterns demonstrate that an ice sheet dome existed in the vicinity of Lough Neagh for much \nof the glacial cycle (Fig. 17B,C,D) (Knight, 2002) and a variety of inverse ice sheet models \nreconstruct an ice ridge over the North Channel linking the Southern Uplands and Lough \nNeagh dispersal centres during, and following, the LGM (e.g Boulton et al.,  1991, 2002). \nTwo major readvances interrupted decay of the Irish Ice Sheet: the Clogher Head Readvance \n(c. 15.0 - 14.2 14C, 18.5 - 16.7 cal ka BP), and the Killard Point Readvance (c. 14.2 - 13.0 14C, \n17.1 - 15.2 cal ka BP), the latter believed to be a direct response to Heinrich Event 1 in the \nNorth Atlantic (McCabe et al., 1998; McCabe and Clark 2003; McCabe et al., 2007a). We \nspeculate that the strong westward ice flow during stage C (Fig. 17C) may have been in \noperation during deposition of a moraine at Corvish, County Donegal, during the Clogher \nHead Readvance (McCabe et al., 2007a).        \nOur interpretation of subsequent westward migration of the Forth-Clyde ice divide towards \nKintyre followed by topographically constrained eastward ice flow (Fig. 17D), is consistent \nwith aspects of the reconstruction by Salt and Evans (2004) (their stages F and G).  Renewed, \nclimatically-driven ice sheet growth over northeast Ireland during the Killard Point Stadial \nhas been suggested by McCabe et al. (1998), and is supported by recent cosmogenic exposure \nages of 15.6 10Be ka BP from moraine sequences in north-western Ireland (Clark et al., 2009). \nIt  is  possible  that  the  thickening of  ice  over  Arran and the  Firth  of  Clyde deduced here \noccurred at a similar time (Fig. 17D).  \n18\n630\n635\n640\n645\n650\n655\n660\n665\nIt is noteworthy that the ice limits during our Stage D (and stage 3 of Paterson et al., 1998) are \nconsistent with the ice sheet configuration in central Scotland suggested by Sissons (1963, \n1964, 1967b) during the hypothesised \u2018Perth Readvance\u2019. All require the presence of a large \nice mass over the Firth of Clyde during deglaciation. Evidence for a significant readvance at \nPerth was questioned by Francis et al. (1970), Paterson (1974), Price (1983), and Sutherland \n(1984), and the concept was rejected by Sissons (1976).   McCabe et al. (2007b) recently cited \nnew evidence in support of a readvance at Perth, which they correlate with the Killard Point \nStadial in Ireland, concluding that it indicated an ice-sheet wide response to North Atlantic \nclimate forcing.  However, the evidence at that location remains open to interpretation (see \ncomments by Peacock et al.,  2007 and reply from McCabe et al.,  2007c).   The evidence \npresented here cannot support nor refute that a more widespread readvance of the eastern ice \nmargin took place at this time.  However, the configuration depicted (Fig. 14D, 17D) would \nhave had the effect of isolating ice masses on the eastern side of the Clyde-Forth drainage \ndivide  from  their  western  source,  possibly  leading  to  development  of  widespread  \u2018ice \nstagnation\u2019 glaciofluvial topography, initially cited as one piece of evidence for the readvance \n(c.f. Sissons 1964).  \nLocal  readvances  have  been  proposed  to  have  occurred during  deglaciation at  Blackrock \nRidge, at the head of Loch Indaal, Islay (Peacock and Merritt, 1997), Stranraer (Charlesworth, \n1926; Peacock and Everest, 2009), and at Armoy and east Antrim on the northeastern Irish \ncoast (McCabe, 2008)  We suggest that moraine building at Blantyreferme and Kilmarnock \n(Fig. 5),  occurred during the same overall  phase of events.   Ice retreat from Loch Indaal \noccurred  possibly  only  a  few  hundred  radiocarbon  years  before  the  beginning  of  the \nLateglacial Interstadial (GI-1) (Peacock, 2008), placing tentative chronological constraints on \nthese late ice margin oscillations.   Work in progress suggests that the outer Firth of Clyde \nwas probably deglaciated before the opening of GI-1, at c. 14.7 cal ka BP (J.D. Peacock, \npersonal communication), with deglaciation of the Glasgow region occurring some time after. \nThe Irish record suggests radically different local ice sheet geometries during build-up and \ndecay  (McCabe,  2008;  Greenwood  and  Clark,  2009b).   In  contrast,  the  ice  sheet  decay \ngeometry  in  west  central  Scotland  is  reconstructed  to  have  been  similar  to  the  build-up \nconfiguration (Fig. 14A, E).  This was likely a result of proximity to the western Highlands, \nwhere the ice sheet was well situated to survive rises in equilibrium altitude during initial \nwarming.  Thus, the western Highlands and parts of Argyll were able to remain an important \nsource area nourishing late stage ice margin oscillations. \n19\n670\n675\n680\n685\n690\n695\n700\n8. Summary of regional events\nFollowing ice sheet build up (Fig. 17A), a centre of relatively immobile ice existed over \nArgyll and west central Scotland (Fig.14B).  Ice from this centre later linked with dispersal \ncentres over Lough Neagh, in Ireland, and over the hills of southwest Scotland and the Lake \nDistrict.  Ice was driven eastward towards the Firth of Forth and through the Stainmore and \nTyne Gaps (Fig. 17C) (Evans et al.,  2009). Ice divides then migrated both eastwards and \nsouthwards  as  a  result  of  enhanced  drawdown  of  ice  towards  shelf-edge  fans  on  the \ncontinental shelf, to the northwest, and into the Irish Sea basin (Fig.17C).  This reorganisation \nseverely reduced the power of eastward flow towards the Firth of Forth and resulted in the \ngenerally accepted, relatively early deglaciation of eastern Scotland. A reversal of ice flow \nalso occurred within the Vale of Eden and Solway Lowlands.\nA major ice-surface high and ice divide developed over the outer Firth of Clyde, possibly \nduring the Killard Point Stadial of Ireland.  The ice divide probably linked with dispersal \ncentres over Lough Neagh and the Southern Uplands (Fig. 17D). The ice sheet surface now \ndescended from west to east over west central Scotland.  On southern fringes of the Southern \nuplands, ice flow became topographically constrained (Salt and Evans, 2004), extending into \nthe Solway Firth (Evans et al., 2009).  \nSubsequent  local  readvances  at  east  Antrim,  Armoy,  Islay,  Stranraer,  Kilmarnock  and \nBlantyreferme  punctuated  late  stages  of  ice  sheet  decay.   Whether  these  ice  margin \noscillations were synchronous and climatically driven, or diachronous and influenced by local \nfactors such as topography and glacier bed hydrology, is uncertain.  The remaining ice mass is \nlikely to have been extremely unstable during final retreat from the Clyde basin, with large \nportions of the bed below the contemporary sea level. \n10. Conclusions\nThe main conclusions from this research are as follows:\n1.   Published  dates  on  preserved  interstadial  organic  deposits  show  that  the  Main  Late \nDevensian (MLD) (MIS 2) glaciation of central Scotland began after 35 ka cal BP. Some \ndeposits of an earlier glaciation (MIS 4 or older) occur locally within the Clyde and Ayshire \nbasins.\n2. During a sustained build-up phase, ice advanced from the western Scottish Highlands into \nthe Clyde and Ayrshire basins.  Glaciomarine muds and shelly deposits scavenged from the \nFirth of Clyde were redeposited widely across Ayrshire.  Ice advance against reverse slopes \n2020\n705\n710\n715\n720\n725\n730\n735\n740\nenabled  the  build  up  of  marginal  sediment  sediment  accumulations.   Some  of  these \naccumulations probably formed pre-cursor ridges, moulded into suites of ribbed moraine by \nsubsequent over-riding.\n3.  Sustained  stadial  conditions  at  the  Last  Glacial  Maximum (LGM) (30-25  ka  cal  BP) \nresulted in development of a major dispersal centre over the Southern Uplands and deflection \nof Highland ice towards the east  and northeast.   Relatively immobile ice beneath an ice-\nsurface \u2018high\u2019 positioned over Ayrshire and the western Clyde basin, preserved previously-\nformed subglacial landforms and fed a wide corridor of fast-flowing ice towards the Firth of \nForth. \n4. A substantial re-configuration of the ice surface over west central Scotland was caused by \nenhanced westward drawdown into the outer Firth of Clyde and eastward migration of an ice \ndivide towards the Clyde-Forth watershed. This reorganisation is tentatively correlated with \nthe Clogher Head Readvance established in the north of Ireland (c. 15.0 - 14.2 14C, 18.5 - 16.7 \ncal ka BP).\n5.  Renewed ice sheet thickening over the Firth of Clyde may have accompanied growth of \nthe Irish Ice sheet during the Killard Point Stadial (c. 14.2 - 13.0 14C, 17.1 - 15.2 cal ka BP). \nSubsequent ice sheet retreat was initially characterised by substantial meltwater production, \nponding and erosion.\n6. One or more significant ice front oscillations occurred late during deglaciation. These were \nnourished by elevated source areas in the western Highlands and Argyll, which were well \nplaced to survive initial warming.  The discovery of De Geer moraines in western Ayrshire \nallows ice margin velocity during one such oscillation to be calculated as \u2264 290 m yr  -1. \nThese late oscillations probably occurred close to the opening of the Lateglacial Interstadial \n(GI-1). \n7.  Once  the  MLD ice  sheet  margin  had  retreated  into  the  inner  Firth  of  Clyde,  it  was \nextremely vulnerable to collapse, which may have occurred early in GI-1. It was accompanied \nby marine incursion of the lower Clyde Valley up to c. 40 m above present-day sea level. \nAcknowledgments\nThis  work  was  carried  out  as  part  of  the  BGS  Clyde  Urban  Super  Project  (CUSP),  a \nmultidisciplinary  study  of  the  Clyde  Basin,  and  is  published  with  the  permission  of  the \n21\n745\n750\n755\n760\n765\n770\n775\nExecutive Director of the British Geological Survey, NERC.
