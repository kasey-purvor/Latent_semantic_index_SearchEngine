By extrapolation back to ambient pressure, thermally activated escape of electrons from\nthe upper lasing state up to delocalized states of the \u0002 valley is shown to be an important\ncontribution to the threshold current. On the other hand leakage into the X valley, although it has a\nvery high density of states and is nearly degenerate with the \u0002 band edge in the barrier, is\ninsignificant at ambient pressure. \u00a9 2006 American Institute of Physics. \u0003DOI: 10.1063\/1.2364159\u0004\nSince the realization of the GaAs-based quantum-\ncascade laser \u0001QCL\u0002,1 an impressive extension of the attain-\nable infrared frequency range has been achieved. It can op-\nerate at wavelengths as long as 160 \u0001m,2 or in dual\nfrequency regime up to 215 \u0001m.3 The design of\nGaAs\/AlGaAs QCLs can be made very flexible by varying\nthe Al content due to naturally occurring near lattice matched\nmaterial system across the full range of Al contents. Hence,\nfollowing the terahertz emitting QCL,4 several laser designs\nbased on 15% Al content in the barriers were presented, ap-\nproaching high temperature pulsed operation5 or close to liq-\nuid nitrogen temperature cw operation.6 GaAs-based QCLs\nemitting in the midinfrared \u0001MIR\u0002 spectral region have so far\nused Al contents of 33%,1 45%,7\u20139 and 100%,10\u201312 respec-\ntively, and have been subjected to a high external magnetic\nfield.13 Pulsed room temperature operation has been reported\nonly for designs with 45% Al content7\u20139 and for a hybrid\nGaAs\/ InAs\/AlAs design.11 Achieving cw operation in MIR\nGaAs-based QCLs is a very challenging task due to the rela-\ntively high threshold current densities \u0001Ith\u0002. Influence of the\ninjector doping,14 the lattice temperature,15 and carrier es-\ncape via weakly localized \u0002 states16 were attributed as major\nlimiting factors, for the high temperature operation and at-\ntainable gain, that determine the increase of Ith and dynamic\nworking range of \u00059 \u0001m GaAs-based QCLs. Nevertheless,\ncw operation has been reported10,17 with operating tempera-\ntures up to 150 K. However, the output characteristics are\nstill inferior compared to InP MIR QCL.18 Apart from\n\u0002-band related scattering, particularly in AlAs material, the\nimportance of \u0002-X transport processes was examined in\ndetail.19,20 Recently, in the Sb-based QCLs the \u0002-X interval-\nley scattering is attributed as a possible limiting factor for the\nemission shorter than \u00054 \u0001m.21\nThe temperature sensitivity of the GaAs\/AlxGa1\u2212xAs\nQCL\u2019s Ith decreases as the Al content increases from 33% to\n45% in the barrier region. This is attributed to the increase in\nthe activation energy for thermal escape12 of electrons from\nthe quantum well into the upper \u0002 miniband of the injector,\nwhich reduces its magnitude. However, at high Al concen-\ntrations the participation of lateral X and L valleys is be-\nlieved to be an important factor deteriorating the device per-\nformance due to the near degeneracy with the \u0002 conduction\nband edge at x=45% in the barrier.22 A key to the correct\ndesign of QCLs is the incorporation of a minigap in the\ninjector states at the energy of the upper lasing level \u0001E3\u0002,\nwhich increases the upper state lifetime and reduces leakage.\nHowever, in GaAs\/AlGaAs devices the bottom of the next\nminiband above E3 is close in energy, and recent work7,12\nreveals the importance of thermally activated escape of elec-\ntrons through this upper \u0002 miniband. Time-resolved experi-\nments have shown that \u0002-\u0002 is faster than \u0002-X scattering in\nspite of the increased density of states in the X valley.23 It is\ncrucial to identify the relative importance of different scat-\ntering mechanisms to the injection current of the QCL. The\nexternally applied high pressure is a very useful tool because\nit tunes the \u0002-X and \u0002-L separations in a controlled manner,\nwithin a single structure. It may therefore be used as a means\nof differentiating between these different current channels\nand the extent to which they contribute to the Ith under am-\nbient conditions, due to the fact that each current channel has\na different pressure dependence.\nIn this letter, we report high-pressure studies of\nGaAs\/Al0.45Ga0.55As QCL measured at 115 K. The devices\nemit at \u00059 \u0001m and were grown by molecular beam epitaxy\non a heavily n-doped GaAs substrate. They have a standard\nstructure with a \u201cdiagonal\u201d transition across three coupled\nquantum wells. The details of the growth and fabrication\nprocedure of the devices can be found in previous work.7,12\nThe lasers were processed with ridges 30 \u0001m wide, cleaved\ninto chips with a cavity length of 2 mm and mounted un-\nbonded in a spring clip that provided electrical and thermal\ncontact. The clip was inside an optical pressure cell, which\nwas in turn in a vacuum, clamped to the underside of a\ncryostat\u2019s nitrogen bath.

The temperature was measured using a\nthermocouple on the outer surface of the pressure cell, which\nhad been previously calibrated using a buried thermocouple\ninside the pressure cell. The measurements were performed\nunder pulsed operation \u000150 ns pulse width at a repetition fre-\nquency of 2 kHz\u0002, thereby minimizing current heating ef-\nfects. Light was collected outside the cell through silicon\nwindows.\nFigure 1 displays the pressure dependence of the thresh-\nold current density. The figure includes a combination of data\ntaken as the pressure was increased and reduced back down\nto 1 atm, showing that the pressure effect is reversible. It was\nfound that Jth increased with increasing pressure by 30%\nover a 7.3 kbar pressure range. The emission spectrum was\nalso measured, slightly above threshold, using an interferom-\neter having a 1 cm\u22121 resolution. A linear shift to longer\nwavelength was observed with a pressure coefficient of the\ntransition energy d\u0001h\u0003\u0002 \/dP=\u22120.417 meV\/kbar as shown in\nFig. 2. The very small tuning in the lasing transition energy\nis indicative that the positions of the energy levels in the\nactive region do not change significantly. This is consistent\nwith the measured L-I-V characteristics at different pres-\nsures, Fig. 3, which show that the applied voltage is also\napproximately independent of pressure \u0001within \u00b12%\u0002. Our\nmodeling shows that even with changes in electric field, the\ndipole matrix element \u0006z32\u0007 stays practically constant. Con-\nsequently we assume that the electric field at threshold can\nbe considered constant in the pressure range used, and the\nmain effect of pressure is to change the lifetime \u00043\nth\n=1\/ \u00011\/\u000431\nph+1\/\u000432\nph+1\/\u0004leak\n\u0002 \u0002. The laser mirror loss is indepen-\ndent of pressure due to the negligible change of the refractive\nindex of the medium over the experimental pressure range.\nTherefore, we only consider pressure-induced changes in\nelectronic band structure and transition rates. The effects of\npressure on band structure that are important for electrons in\nthe conduction band of a GaAs\/AlGaAs heterostructure \u0001see\nFig. 2 insert\u0002 are \u0001a\u0002 reduction of the separation between the\n\u0002 and X conduction band edge energies at dE\u0002,X \/dP\u0005\n\u221213.5 meV\/kbar, \u0001b\u0002 increase of the separation between the\n\u0002 and L conduction band edges at dE\u0002,L \/dP\u00052 meV\/kbar,\n\u0001c\u0002 decrease slightly of the \u0002-\u0002 band offset due to the differ-\nence in pressure coefficients of the two materials at\ndE\u0002,\u0002 \/dP\u0005\u22121.2 meV\/kbar, and \u0001d\u0002 blueshift of the \u0002 band\ngap at dEg \/dP\u000510 meV\/kbar. The pressure variation of the\nvarious band edges in the well or barrier material at the \u0002\npoint was estimated from dEg\u0001CB\u0002\n\u0002 \/dP=\u22123ag\u0001CB\u0002 \/ \u0001c11+2c12\u0002,\nwhere ag\u0001CB\u0002 is the energy gap \u0001conduction band\u0002 deforma-\ntion potential and cij are elastic constants,24 while at the X\npoint dECBX \/dP=\u22120.8 meV\/kbar.\n25\nBecause the \u0002-L separation increases with pressure, if\nleakage through L were important the Ith would decrease.\nThis is counter to our observation \u0001Fig. 1\u0002 and hence we\ndiscount this current path. We therefore assume that the\npressure-induced changes occur mainly in the relative posi-\ntions of the \u0002 and X states in the heterostructure. At the\nhighest pressure studied, which corresponds to near degen-\neracy of the barrier X valley with the upper lasing state, one\nmight expect considerable influence of this valley \u0001though, as\nshown below this is not the case\u0002.\nThe change in band gap \u0001corresponding to a 5% blue-\nshift over the experimental pressure range\u0002 produces a pro-\nportional increase in the electron effective mass m* at the \u0002\npoint according to the Kane model, and hence also a redshift\nin the intersubband quantization energy.26 The calculated\ntuning of the energy levels according to an eight-band k \u00b7P\nenvelope function model \u0001i.e., including nonparabolicity\u0002 for\nFIG. 1.

This\nshows excellent agreement with the experiment. The pres-\nsure tuning of the lasing wavelength is rather smaller \u00013%\nover the experimental pressure range\u0002 than the change in\nband-edge effective mass \u00015%\u0002. The small change in emis-\nsion wavelength and the invariant I-V characteristics \u0001see\nFig. 3\u0002 suggest that the alignment of the QCL structure, so\ncritical to its operation, is virtually unchanged over the pres-\nsure range measured.\nThe total threshold current may be written as Ith= Iph\n+ Ileak\n\u0002 + Ileak\nX\n.

Since the upper \u0002-miniband states have most of their\nweight in the continuum, their energy follows the barrier \u0002\nband edge and this leads to a slight reduction of \u0006Eact\u0002 . The \u0002\nand X valleys of the barrier material are degenerate at ambi-\nent pressure, so the initial activation energies \u0006Eact\n\u0002,X to the \u0002\nand X states are nearly identical. While only a slight varia-\ntion in \u0006Eact\n\u0002 is expected with pressure, \u0006EactX is expected to\nchange by \u000580% over the experimental pressure range. The\ncalculated normalized pressure dependence of the three re-\nspective current components is displayed in the inset of Fig.\n1. It shows that Iph remains fairly constant over the pressure\nrange considered. Ileak\u0002 increases significantly, while IleakX\nshows the most rapid increase. Figure 1 displays fits to the\nexperiment using the different combinations of the above\nthree current components: either ignoring \u0002 leakage or ignor-\ning X leakage. It shows that Iph\/ Ith\nP=0=81% and\nIleak\n\u0002 \/ Ith\nP=0=19% \u0001solid line\u0002 gives a good fit to the experi-\nmental data over the pressure range considered. We observed\nconsiderably bigger \u0002 leakage than previously predicted29\nfor the same QCL structure.7 Current leakage via \u0002-X tran-\nsitions is negligible in the pressure range we studied. This is\nconsistent with previous measurements of the temperature\ndependence and barrier height dependence of Ith where it was\nfound that nonradiative current via optical phonon scattering\ndominates Ith at low temperature while carrier leakage into\nthe \u0002 miniband is responsible for the temperature depen-\ndence of the devices at higher temperatures.12\nIn summary, in order to understand the origin of Ith in\nGaAs\/Al0.45Ga0.55As QCL, an experimental and theoretical\nstudy of its pressure dependence has been reported. The po-\nsitions of the energy levels in the QCL\u2019s active region do not\nchange significantly over the pressure range considered but\nseparation between \u0002 and X band edges can be tuned. We\nconclude that the relative contributions from LO phonon\nscattering in \u0002 band and \u0002 leakage to the Ith are approxi-\nmately in the ratio 4:1, whereas X leakage is less than 0.03%\nand consequently negligible in this particular design.\nThe authors would like to thank D.
