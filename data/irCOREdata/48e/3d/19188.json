In problem-based learning (PBL), students use\n'triggers' from clinical scenarios to define their own learn-\ning objectives and inform independent research, the find-\nings of which are refined in group discussions[2].\nKnowledge is thus acquired in an active and self-directed\nway, unconstrained by subject divisions[3]. PBL is being\nincreasingly favoured by medical educationalists, as it has\nbeen shown by some to better prepare students for the\nteamwork, communication skills and patient interaction\nrequired in clinical practice[4,5]. However, other studies\nhave concluded that there is no convincing evidence that\nPBL improves knowledge base and clinical perform-\nance[5,6].\nSeveral research papers have shown higher levels of stress\namong medical students[7] and qualified doctors[8] com-\npared to the general population. This may be detrimental,\nas long-lasting increased stress can lead to decreased work\nperformance[9], substance abuse[10] and mental health\nproblems[11]. Sources of medical student stress are often\ngrouped into three main areas: academic pressures, social\/\npersonal issues, and financial problems[12]. However, a\nstudy of stress in first-year medical undergraduates on a\nPBL curriculum in Glasgow found that the principal stres-\nsors were related to medical training (in particular, uncer-\ntainty about study behaviour, progress and aptitude)\nrather than personal problems[13].\nUnderstanding the current stressors faced by medical stu-\ndents, particularly those related to modern medical educa-\ntional techniques, is a crucial first-step in being able to\nminimise unnecessary stress when designing medical\ndegree programmes. It will also inform discussion about\nhow stress in medical students is best managed. The aim\nof this study is to build on previous work by comparing\nthe frequency of a number of course-related stressors\nreported by contemporary second-year medical students\non a PBL and a non-PBL five-year undergraduate medical\ncourse.\nMethods\nWe conducted a cross-sectional, self-report questionnaire\nstudy in two UK medical schools in the academic year\n2007-2008. Ethical approval was granted prior to study\ncommencement by the University of Birmingham Medi-\ncal School Education Unit.\nAll UK medical schools that run a five-year undergraduate\nmedical degree programme were eligible for inclusion,\nsubject to the following exclusion criteria: i) medical\nschools in Scotland as Scottish students do not pay top-up\ntuition fees, which could be a confounder given that\nfinancial burden is an established stressor in stu-\ndents[12,13]; ii) London medical schools, due to the\nhigher cost of living in London compared to the rest of the\ncountry; iii) medical schools with three-year pre-clinical\ncourses, as most run a separate degree in this time which\nmay be associated with different stressors among stu-\ndents.\nSixteen eligible medical schools (N = 16) were invited to\nparticipate by email. Non-responders were reminded by\ntelephone at 2 and 4 weeks. Four (25%) refused and five\n(31%) failed to respond. The seven that agreed to take part\n(44%) were categorised into two groups based on infor-\nmation about the proportion of core teaching sessions\ndeemed to be problem-based in the second-year academic\ntimetable. This information was provided by the Director\nof Medical Education or the Dean. Programmes were clas-\nsified as PBL or non-PBL if overall course content was\nreported to be \u226550% or <50% PBL respectively. Two were\nclassified as PBL and five as non-PBL. From this list, one\nmedical school from each group (PBL and non-PBL) was\nselected randomly via a computer. The two participating\nmedical schools remain anonymous as part of the agreed\nterms for undertaking the study. The overall course con-\ntent taught via PBL was reported to be 100% in the PBL\nuniversity where lectures and seminars are used only to\nsupport PBL, and 0% in the non-PBL university where\nthere are no PBL sessions.\nSecond-year students in each medical school were invited\nto participate. Second-years were chosen to minimise the\nrisk of confounding by non-course-related stressors. In\ncontrast to first-year students, they are less likely to expe-\nrience stressors related to adapting to a new lifestyle and\nway of learning[14]. Students in third-year onwards are\npredominantly hospital-based, and follow a vocational\nrather than a PBL or non-PBL style of learning. Question-\nnaires were distributed during second-year plenary ses-\nsions in each institution in order to maximise student\nrecruitment and were collected immediately after comple-\ntion. A detachable Participant Information Sheet was\nattached to the questionnaire and students were able to\nask the researchers any questions about the study prior to\ndeciding whether or not to participate. Questionnaires\nwere completed voluntarily and anonymously.\nOutcome Measures\nA 16-question, self-report questionnaire to measure\ncourse-related stressors was developed by combining\nparts of two existing scales: the Perceived Medical Student\nStress scale (PMSS)[12] and the Higher Education Stress\nInventory (HESI)[15]. Both questionnaires had shortcom-\nings for the purpose of this study, therefore relevant ques-\ntions from each were selected. The HESI surveyed issues\noutside the remit of this study (such as concerns that 'aPage 2 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Medical Education 2009, 9:60 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6920\/9\/60cold and impersonal attitude is enhanced by education'\nand 'the professional role is in conflict with personal val-\nues'). The older PMSS scale contained questions that were\nless relevant to modern medical courses and also outside\nthe remit of this study (such as concerns that 'medical\nschool is more of a threat than a challenge' and 'students\nwill be unable to endure the long hours and responsibili-\nties associated with clinical training and practice').\nResponse options were presented on a 4-point Likert scale\n(strongly agree\/agree\/disagree\/strongly disagree). The\nquestionnaire was piloted on 30 third-year medical stu-\ndents at one of the potential universities to assess accept-\nability, understanding and average completion time.\nSubsequently, two questions (4 and 8) were rephrased to\naid comprehension, without changing the essence of their\nmeaning. The final set of questions is presented in Table\n1. Demographic information collected included: age, sex,\nEnglish as a first language, international student status,\nprevious degrees, housing, physical or mental illness,\nfinancial stress, and a measure of recent (previous 6\nmonths) adverse life events (e.g. illness, bereavement,\nsevere relationship problems) based on the Brief Life\nEvent Questionnaire (BLEQ)[16].\nData Analysis\nData were analysed using SPSS (Version 16.0). Non-para-\nmetric analyses were conducted due to significant devia-\ntions from normality in the data. Demographics were\nTable 1: Frequency of responses for each course-related stressor by course type\nQuestion Course type Agree Disagree \u03c72 Odds Ratio\nN (%) N (%) (P-Value) (95% CI)\n1.

Each perceived\nstressor was compared between groups using Pearson's\nchi-squared test and crude odds ratios were calculated. To\nensure that there were adequate numbers in each cell for\nmeaningful statistical analysis, the 4-point Likert scales\nwere dichotomised into two broad categories for each of\nthe 16 potential course-related stressors. These were\n'agree' (comprising strongly agree\/agree) and 'disagree'\n(comprising strongly disagree\/disagree). Relationships\nbetween socio-demographic variables and each potential\nstressor were examined in both groups separately using\nchi-squared and Mann-Whitney U tests, depending on\ndata type. Binary logistic regression using backward step-\nwise likelihood-ratio for variable selection was carried out\nto determine the best predictors of group membership\n(PBL v non-PBL). All socio-demographic variables and\ncourse-related stressors that were significantly different\nbetween groups in univariate analyses were entered into\nthe model.\nResults\nResponse rates\nAt the PBL university 86 out of 157 students (55%) were\npresent at the plenary session. Of these, 83 (97%)\nresponded. At the non-PBL university 198 out of 231 stu-\ndents (86%) were present at the lecture. Of these, 197\n(99%) responded. There was no statistically significant\ndifference between the proportion of males and females\nin our sample and in the entire year group at either uni-\nversity (\u03c72 = 0.088, p = 0.766 PBL university; \u03c72 = 0.001, p\n= 0.979 non-PBL university).\nDemographics\nSocio-demographic variables were compared between the\ntwo groups (Table 2). Compared to students at the non-\nPBL university, those at the PBL university were signifi-\ncantly older (p < 0.0001), and were more likely to have a\nprevious degree (p < 0.0001), live in a family home (p <\n0.0001) and have a recent adverse life event (p = 0.03).\nSignificantly fewer students at the PBL university reported\nEnglish as their first language, compared to the non-PBL\nuniversity (p = 0.001). There were no significant differ-\nences between groups on other socio-demographic varia-\nbles.\nPerceived stressors\nWe compared the frequency of responses for each of the\n16 perceived stressors between students at the two univer-\nsities (Table 1). The groups responded significantly differ-\nently to 8 out of 16 questions (50%). Compared to\nstudents at the non-PBL university, significantly more stu-\ndents at the PBL university agreed that: i) they did not\nknow what the faculty expected of them (Q3) (p = 0.001);\nTable 2: Socio-demographic comparison between students on the PBL and non-PBL programmes\nDemographic PBL Non-PBL Test Value P-Value\nN = 83 N = 197 (Chi-Squared if not otherwise specified)\nAge Median 22 20 Kolmogorov Smirnov Z 2.545 < 0.0001\nIQR\u00a4 6 1 Mann Whitney U 5108.5 < 0.0001\nRange 32 (19 - 51) 22 (19 - 41)\nSex Male 28 (33.7%) 77 (39.1%) 0.714 0.398\nFemale 55 (66.3%) 120 (60.9%)\nPrevious degree Yes 40 (48.2%) 33 (16.8%) 29.951 < 0.0001\nNo 43 (51.8%) 164 (83.2%)\nInternational student Yes 12 (14.5%) 18 (9.2%) 1.69 0.194\nNo 71 (85.5%) 178 (90.8%)\nEnglish as first language Yes 70 (84.3%) 188 (95.9%) 11.236 0.001\nNo 13 (15.7%) 8 (4.1%)\nAccommodation UA\u00a4 4 (4.8%) 16 (8.1%) 22.446 < 0.0001\nPRA\u00a4 59 (71.1%) 171 (86.8%)\nFH\u00a4 7 (8.4%) 3 (1.5%)\nOther 13 (15.7%) 7 (3.6%)\nPhysical illness Yes 7 (8.4%) 22 (11.2%) 0.47 0.493\nNo 76 (89.6%) 175 (88.8%)\nMental illness Never 74 (89.2%) 183 (92.9%) 1.097 0.578\nPrevious 3 (3.6%) 5 (2.5%)\nCurrent 6 (7.2%) 9 (4.6%)\nRecent life events Yes 22 (26.8%) 31 (15.7%) 4.63 0.031\nNo 60 (73.2%) 166 (84.3%)\nFinancial stress Yes 19 (22.9%) 38 (19.4%) 0.44 0.507\nNo 64 (77.1%) 158 (80.6%)\n\u00a4 Abbreviations: IQR = Interquartile Range; UA = University Accommodation; PRA = Private Rented Accommodation; FH = Family HomePage 4 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Medical Education 2009, 9:60 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6920\/9\/60ii) there were too many small group sessions facilitated\nonly by students, resulting in an unclear curriculum (Q4)\n(p < 0.0001); iii) the education they received was not giv-\ning them adequate preparation for clinical years (Q8) (p\n= 0.007); iv) medical training controls their life, leaving\nlittle time for other activities (Q14) (p = 0.03); and, v)\nthere was a lack of opportunity to explore academic sub-\njects of interest (Q10) (p = 0.01). Significantly fewer stu-\ndents on the PBL course agreed that: i) there was a lack of\nencouragement from teachers (Q11) (p = 0.02); ii) the\nmedical course fostered a sense of anonymity and feelings\nof isolation amongst students (Q13) (p = 0.001); and, iii)\nthe course conformed to their prior expectations (Q16) (p\n= 0.01).\nThere was no significant difference between the propor-\ntion of students on the two course types reporting the\nthree most frequently reported stressors: i) 70% of all stu-\ndents (75% PBL and 68% non-PBL) were concerned that\nthey would be unable to master the entire pool of medical\nknowledge (Q5); ii) 68% (63% PBL and 70% non-PBL)\nfelt that the course was currently putting them under sig-\nnificant amounts of stress (Q2); and, iii) 66% (62% PBL\nand 67% non-PBL) felt there was a lack of feedback from\nteachers (Q12). Although the majority of students in each\nuniversity disagreed that there was a lack of time to carry\nout personal study (Q9) and that medical school was\nmore competitive than they expected (Q6), these stressors\nwere still frequently reported (42% and 46% of all stu-\ndents respectively). Importantly, the majority of students\nin each university agreed that they were enjoying being at\nmedical school (Q1) and that there was not a lack of sup-\nport from peers (Q15). These were two of the least fre-\nquently reported stressors (4% and 12% of all students\nrespectively).\nNo significant relationships were found between any of\nthe socio-demographic variables and any of the stressors\nin either group.\nLogistic regression\nAll socio-demographic variables (age, previous degree,\nEnglish as a first language, accommodation, and recent\nlife events) and course-related stressors (Q3, Q4, Q8,\nQ10, Q11, Q13, Q14, and Q16) that were significantly\ndifferent between groups in univariate analyses were\nentered into the model. After controlling for socio-demo-\ngraphic differences between the groups, five course-\nrelated stressors were found to be significant predictors of\nPBL versus non-PBL status. The best regression model\naccounted for 49% of variance (Nagelkerke R2 = 0.486)\nand correctly classified 83% of participants as PBL or non-\nPBL. The significant predictors of PBL status were: i) more\nlikely to agree that they did not know what the faculty\nexpected of them (Q3) (OR = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.17-0.89, p\n= 0.03); ii) more likely to agree that there were too many\nsmall group sessions facilitated only by students, resulting\nin an unclear curriculum (Q4) (OR = 0.04, 95% CI =\n0.008-0.16, p < 0.0001); iii) more likely to agree that there\nwas a lack of opportunity to explore academic subjects of\ninterest (Q10) (OR = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.18-0.87, p = 0.02);\niv) less likely to agree that there was a lack of encourage-\nment from teachers (Q11) (OR = 3.11, 95% CI = 1.24-\n7.81, p = 0.02); and, v) less likely to agree that the medical\ncourse fostered a sense of anonymity and feelings of isola-\ntion amongst students (Q13) (OR = 3.42, 95% CI = 1.38-\n8.47, p = 0.008).\nDiscussion\nThis is the first comparison of course-related stressors\nbetween medical students on PBL and non-PBL pro-\ngrammes in the UK. Our questionnaire was based on two\nexisting measures of course-related stress in medical stu-\ndents, and was piloted to ensure adequate comprehension\nand acceptability. The response rate of students present at\nthe plenary teaching session in both universities was high\nand our analysis suggests that both groups were represent-\native of the study population in terms of gender. Although\nour two groups were significantly different on a number\nof socio-demographic variables, we did not find any rela-\ntionships between these variables and the reporting of\nstressors and a multivariate analysis was conducted to\ncontrol for these differences.\nStressors in PBL compared to non-PBL students\nCompared to students on the traditional (non-PBL) pro-\ngramme, significantly more students on the PBL pro-\ngramme felt that they did not know what the faculty\nexpected of them and that there were too many student-\nfacilitated sessions, resulting in an unclear curriculum.\nAlthough the majority of PBL students disagreed with\nthese statements, they are clearly potential stressors for a\nsignificant minority (39% and 29% PBL students respec-\ntively). This could be because of a lack of clearly defined\nlimits related to the learning outcomes of PBL scenarios,\nresulting in uncertainty as to the depth of learning\nrequired. This could lead to student insecurity and lack of\nconfidence about whether they have learnt the relevant\nconcepts in inadequate, or even excessive, detail for\nassessments, adding to the established fear among medi-\ncal students of making a mistake[12]. The feeling of insuf-\nficient completion of work may lead to a greater amount\nof time dedicated to studying, possibly explaining why\nthey were more likely to feel that there was a lack of\nopportunity to explore academic subjects of interest (50%\nPBL students agreed with this statement compared with\n34% non-PBL students). Our findings concur with those\nof Moffat et al, which showed that PBL medical students\nin Glasgow felt uncertain about their study behaviour,\nprogress and aptitude[13].Page 5 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Medical Education 2009, 9:60 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6920\/9\/60Our study also revealed that, compared to the non-PBL\nstudents, significantly fewer students on the PBL pro-\ngramme felt that there was a lack of encouragement from\nteachers (27% PBL students versus 42% non-PBL stu-\ndents) and an increased sense of anonymity and isolation\namong students (20% PBL students versus 42% non-PBL\nstudents). The data we received from Directors of Medical\nEducation\/Deans at the universities showed that, as\nexpected, the non-PBL programme has fewer small group\nteaching sessions than the PBL programme, implying that\nthe non-PBL students spend a greater proportion of time\nas a large year group (which is also larger than the PBL\nuniversity's year group: 231 versus 157 respectively).\nWithin this setting there is less opportunity for contact\nwith, and encouragement from, tutors and therefore a\npotential reduction in the sense of individuality amongst\nstudents.\nOverall frequencies of reported stressors\nWe identified large numbers of students at both universi-\nties reporting 'significant amounts of stress' due to study-\ning medicine, which correlates with other research[7,17].\nIn total 19% students 'strongly agreed' and 49% 'agreed'\n(68% in total agreed) with this statement. However, the\nmajority of students at both universities reported 'enjoy-\ning being at medical school', with 56% strongly agreeing\nwith this statement. Concern about acquiring adequate\nand entire medical knowledge was the most frequently\nreported stressor on both course types (20% students\n'strongly agreed' and 49% students 'agreed', so 69% in\ntotal agreed), and has been demonstrated in other\nresearch[12]. Another commonly reported stressor among\nstudents was the lack of feedback from teachers, as\nreported above; a finding reinforced by Duffield et al[18].\nDespite being one of the more frequently reported stres-\nsors, the majority of students (54%) disagreed with the\nstatement that medical school was more competitive than\nthey had expected. This could be due to strong peer rela-\ntionships, as only a minority of students reported that\nthere was a lack of peer support (67% 'disagreed' and 21%\n'strongly disagreed' so 88% in total disagreed) and it is\nknown that such support reduces the feeling of 'peer com-\npetition' and is potentially important for managing stress\nlevels[19].\nDespite the fact that PBL is considered advantageous for\nencouraging active learning and that non-PBL courses are\noften criticised for relying on passive reception of knowl-\nedge, it is interesting and heartening that there was no sig-\nnificant difference between the two courses in terms of\nwhether students thought the course relied on passive\nreception of knowledge (73% students at the PBL univer-\nsity and 66% students at the non-PBL university disagreed\nwith this statement).\nImplications and Recommendations\nIn this study we have found that, although most students\nenjoy being at medical school, various course-related\nstressors affect them and these are related to the type of\nprogramme being followed. Medical schools should be\ninformed of the types and frequency of stressors their stu-\ndents perceive so that measures can be taken to help stu-\ndents adopt appropriate coping mechanisms resulting in\ndecreased psychological morbidity[14] and, potentially,\nincreased academic performance[20]. Student support\nservices may be adapted to deliver a more effective system\ntailored to their students' needs. For example, it may be\nthat PBL students require coaching on attaining a healthy\nwork-life balance and how to cope with setting their own\nlearning goals. Those responsible for PBL programme\ndesign should consider making regular assessments of the\nquality of PBL scenarios to ensure that the learning out-\ncomes students pick out from cues in the problems are\nconsistent with the intended learning outcomes. Students\nshould be reassured that this happens in order to increase\nself-confidence in their learning. Students should under-\nstand the emphasis on continuous learning to eradicate\nthe perception that the entirety of medical knowledge\nmust be instantly mastered. Non-PBL programmes should\nconsider ways of increasing encouragement given to stu-\ndents and reducing feelings of anonymity among the stu-\ndent body. Increasing the number of small-group teaching\nsessions would seem an obvious first-step to achieving\nthis. Both course types could benefit from increasing the\namount of feedback provided by teachers. Furthermore,\nthe role of the teacher within the context of PBL could be\nredefined to offer more active support to students. We\nbelieve our findings are also important for prospective\nmedical students in choosing the most appropriate pro-\ngramme for their needs. For example, a prospective stu-\ndent who finds it difficult to switch off from work and has\na highly perfectionistic approach to their studies may be\nless suited to a PBL programme.\nLimitations\nOur findings must be interpreted in light of a number of\nlimitations. The study was based on only two medical\nschools. There were several reasons given by medical\nschools that refused to participate, including: question-\nnaire fatigue among their students, course restructure, and\nconcerns over high stress levels among their students. This\nstudy is therefore limited to the specific implementations\nof PBL and non-PBL curricula at the two participating\nschools, and cannot be generalised to all other PBL and\nnon-PBL medical programmes in the UK. Moreover, the\ntwo programmes contained extremes of PBL content (0%\nand 100%) so our study does not cover the continuum of\nPBL content between these two extremes. Although the\nresponse rates were high among those students present atPage 6 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Medical Education 2009, 9:60 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6920\/9\/60the plenary sessions (97% and 99%), a number of stu-\ndents were absent which may bias the data. It is difficult\nto determine whether students who were more or less\nstressed would be less likely to attend or to refuse to\nanswer our questionnaire. In addition, the level of per-\nceived anonymity is diminished in a lecture hall environ-\nment. A relatively low proportion of students (55%) were\npresent at the plenary session in the PBL university, which\nmay be because the session attended was early in the\nmorning. Other documented reasons for non-attendance\nat teaching sessions among medical students include a\ndislike of lecture-based teaching or perceived quality of\nthe session[21]. Other potential confounders that have\nnot been addressed include differences between the\nschools other than curriculum format or quality of imple-\nmentation of the curriculum, recent curriculum changes,\nethnicity of students, and proportion of students with rel-\natives in the medical profession. Proximity to examina-\ntions is also a confounding factor that could not be\ncontrolled. Only selected questions were taken from the\nPMSS and HESI, raising issues regarding our resulting\nquestionnaire's validity. Changing the wording of two of\nthe questions as a consequence of our pilot study feed-\nback, could also detract from the original questionnaires'\nvalidity, despite enhancing comprehensibility. The use of\na self-report questionnaire limited the types of stressors\nthat could be reported by students. We recognise that 16\nvariables were examined separately in the univariate anal-\nyses; however, concern about multiple testing was\naddressed by using a multivariate logistic regression.\nConclusion\nPrevious research has shown that medical students experi-\nence high levels of stress related to their medical educa-\ntion as well as personal and financial issues, and that this\ncan affect their academic performance and wellbeing. This\nis the first study to show that there are significant differ-\nences in perceived course-related stressors between under-\ngraduate medical students on a PBL and a non-PBL\nprogramme in the UK. PBL is becoming increasingly pop-\nular in medical education, therefore it is important that its\nassociated stressors are understood so that they can be\nminimised or dealt with effectively. Further research, with\na larger and broader sample of medical schools and stu-\ndents, is warranted in this area. Semi-structured interviews\nwould allow the identification of any additional perceived\ncourse-related stressors. Longitudinal studies may be of\ninterest in analysing how perceived stressors change\nthroughout students' time at medical school, especially in\nthe transition from the pre-clinical to the clinical stage, on\nthe two different course types.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nADL, DBM, HEM, LJH, SLB, EER conceived of the study\nand conducted the data collection.
