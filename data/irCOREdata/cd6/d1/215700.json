This randomised controlled trial will\nevaluate whether regular structured practice nurse reviews lead to better mental health and social outcomes for\nthese patients and will assess the cost-effectiveness of the structured reviews compared to usual care.\nThe hypothesis is that structured, pro-active care of patients with chronic depression in primary care will lead to a\ncost-effective improvement in medical and social outcomes when compared with usual general practitioner (GP)\ncare.\nMethods\/Design: Participants were recruited from 42 general practices throughout the United Kingdom. Eligible\nparticipants had to have a history of chronic major depression, recurrent major depression or chronic dsythymia\nconfirmed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). They also needed to score 14 or above\non the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) at recruitment.\nOnce consented, participants were randomised to treatment as usual from their general practice (controls) or the\npractice nurse led intervention. The intervention includes a specially prepared education booklet and a compre-\nhensive baseline assessment of participants\u2019 mood and any associated physical and psycho-social factors, followed\nby regular 3 monthly reviews by the nurse over the 2 year study period. At these appointments intervention parti-\ncipants\u2019 mood will be reviewed, together with their current pharmacological and psychological treatments and any\nrelevant social factors, with the nurse suggesting possible amendments according to evidence based guidelines.\nThis is a chronic disease management model, similar to that used for other long-term conditions in primary care.\nThe primary outcome is the BDI-II, measured at baseline and 6 monthly by self-complete postal questionnaire. Sec-\nondary outcomes collected by self-complete questionnaire at baseline and 2 years include social functioning, qual-\nity of life and data for the economic analyses. Health service data will be collected from GP notes for the 24\nmonths before recruitment and the 24 months of the study.\nDiscussion: 558 participants were recruited, 282 to the intervention and 276 to the control arm. The majority were\nrecruited via practice database searches using relevant READ codes.\nTrial registration: ISRCTN36610074\nBackground\nMajor depression is very common, with a UK prevalence\nat any time of at least 5%, with another 5% having\nmilder episodes [1]. The majority of people with depres-\nsion in the UK are treated within general practice, it\nbeing the third most common reason for consultations\n[2]. Despite evidence that over half of all patients with\nan acute depressive episode will have a recurrence, and\nthat the risk of further recurrences increases greatly\nwith further episodes, there appears to be little consis-\ntency in the longer-term management of the disorder,\nand significant psychological, physical and social mor-\nbidity in this group [3,4]. In addition, a significant min-\nority of patients (around 18-25%) will have chronic\n* Correspondence: m.buszewicz@ucl.ac.uk\n1Research Department of Primary Care & Population Health, University\nCollege London (Archway Campus), Highgate Hill, London N19 5LW, UK\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nBuszewicz et al.

Chronicity is associated with\ngreater likelihood of psychological, physical and social\nmorbidity, an earlier death from all causes, and the\nhealth and social costs are considerable [5,6]. Incom-\nplete recovery increases the risk of relapse and may pre-\ndict long-term outcome more accurately than baseline\nseverity [7,8]. Evidence also shows that the earlier a\nrecurrence is detected, the better and speedier the\nrecovery, but currently many such patients may be\ninadequately treated and have little or no specific fol-\nlow-up in primary care [9,4].\nThe rationale behind this trial was the treatment of\ndepression as a potentially chronic or recurring pro-\nblem, using regular pro-active contact and follow-up of\nat risk patients by practice nurses, supported by general\npractitioners (GPs) in their practices [10]. There is evi-\ndence in favour of such strategies from the USA, but\nthey have not yet been formally researched in the UK\n[11]. Work from the USA has shown that organised,\nenhanced care can have a beneficial effect both on the\noutcomes of patients with acute major depression and\nalso those with a high risk of recurrence [12,13]. How-\never, there is also some evidence that the effect of such\na coordinated approach can lapse over time and recent\nwork has indicated that a longer-term approach may be\nindicated, particularly for those at risk of chronic diffi-\nculties [14,15].\nThe form of organised or enhanced care being\ntrialled has elements in common with the manage-\nment of other chronic diseases in general practice,\nsuch as asthma, diabetes and hypertension [10]. Evi-\ndence based guidelines identify similar elements of\npatient care for a range of chronic conditions, includ-\ning a well-defined care plan, patient education, sched-\nuled follow-ups, review of outcome and concordance,\nand targeted use of specialist consultation or referral\n[16]. Practice nurses are in an excellent position to\nprovide such an approach and there is evidence that\nthey can do this very well, often communicating parti-\ncularly effectively with patients in the management of\nchronic problems [17].\nFeasibility Work\nA 6-month pilot feasibility study was conducted in three\ngeneral practices in North London, with 35 patients ran-\ndomised by practice. The aim was to test out the inter-\nvention and the measures to be used in a full trial and\nto conduct qualitative, in-depth interviews with 12\npatients who completed the intervention. Participants\nresponded well to this practice nurse intervention, parti-\ncularly valuing contact with someone who they per-\nceived as a \u2018normal, mature person drawing on their\nown experience\u2019, rather than with a mental health pro-\nfessional. Practice nurses had more time than GPs, gave\nhelpful, practical advice and a sense that they were\ninterested in patients\u2019 problems [18].\nThis pilot study demonstrated that it was feasible to\nrecruit sufficient eligible participants willing to take part\nand that they would be able to complete the relevant\nquestionnaires. The feasibility study also indicated that\nthe chances of contamination between intervention and\ncontrol patients within a practice was low, as the major-\nity of the patient contact in the intervention was carried\nout by nurses who were very unlikely have consultations\nwith the control patients to discuss their mental health\nsymptoms, although they might carry out other practice\nnurse consultations for physical health reasons. We\ntherefore decided to randomise by patient within prac-\ntices in the main trial, rather than carrying out a cluster\nrandomisation design.\nMethods\/Design\nThis is a randomised controlled trial, with randomisa-\ntion by patient within practices. The comparison is\nbetween \u2018GP usual care\u2019 (control arm), and a \u2018structured\ncare\u2019 approach involving regular follow-up by practice\nnurses (intervention arm) in addition to GP usual care,\nfor patients with a history of recurrent or chronic\ndepression.\nParticipants were recruited from 38 general practices\nwhich are members of the Medical Research Council\u2019s\nGeneral Practice Research Framework (MRC GPRF), a\nframework of over 1,000 general practices throughout\nthe United Kingdom. An additional 4 practices were\nrecruited, having received details of the study and\nexpressing an interest in participating (2 from the UK\u2019s\nPrimary Care Research Network and 2 from local con-\ntacts).

Patients who expressed\nsuicidal ideas were not excluded, but the practice nurses\nwere given clear guidelines about their management and\nat what point it would be appropriate to communicate\nwith the GP if they were concerned about a patient.\nInclusion criteria\n(i) Men and women aged 18 and over\n(ii) Two or more documented episodes of depression\nwithin the previous 3 years\n(These may have been separate episodes with a period\nof well-being in-between, or a documented history of\nchronic depression.

Those who declined were asked to\ngive an indication of their reasons for this on the reply\nslip.\nThose who met with the nurse and still wanted to\ntake part after discussing the study were assessed for\neligibility using the Composite International Diagnostic\nInterview (CIDI) questionnaire and given a Beck\nDepression Inventory (BDI-II) questionnaire to complete\n[20,21]. Those who fulfilled the inclusion criteria and\ngave fully informed consent had their details passed to\nan independent computerised telephone\/internet based\nrandomisation centre. The nurse was able to let partici-\npants know their randomisation outcome at the baseline\ninterview. All eligible consented participants in both\ngroups were asked to complete the baseline question-\nnaires in a quiet place in the practice centre before they\nleft, with the aim of achieving a high response rate.\nRandomisation\nWe used the MRC computerised telephone randomisa-\ntion service in Aberdeen, which provides an efficient\nautomated 24-hour service and the choice of randomisa-\ntion by telephone or Internet in each case. Randomisa-\ntion was at the patient level within each practice, using\na block design to maintain a balance of numbers in the\ncontrol and intervention groups.\nTrial Intervention\nThe trial intervention aims to combine management\nstrategies already familiar to primary care staff, but in a\nconcerted and consistent manner [22]. It was found to\nbe well within the expertise of the practice nurses\ninvolved in the feasibility study. The model is similar in\nsome ways to that used in the longer-term care of\npatients with asthma or diabetes in primary care. Com-\nponents include:\nRecall system\nRecall systems have been set up within the participating\npractices based on the practice computer and managed\nby the practice research nurse, who is responsible for\ncontacting the intervention patients. If participants fail\nto attend a review appointment they are asked to make\nanother appointment. If they fail to attend again, they\nare contacted for review at the next time point.\nClinical review\nFor all intervention participants the practice research\nnurse undertook a baseline assessment, asking about\ncurrent mood, social circumstances, current treatment\n(medication and\/or psychological therapy), and any side-\neffects or queries. Participants were given a specially\nwritten educational booklet about depression and its\ntreatment at this initial appointment. There is evidence\nthat appropriate patient education materials can be\nhelpful as part of an integrated approach\u2019 [11-13]. This\npatient booklet was written specifically for the patients\nin this study and outlines current evidence based think-\ning about the treatment of depression.\nThe nurses answered participants\u2019 questions about\ncurrent or past treatments and checked their concor-\ndance with the treatments they were currently receiving,\nclarifying any reasons for poor concordance. If there\nBuszewicz et al. BMC Psychiatry 2010, 10:61\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-244X\/10\/61\nPage 3 of 9\nwere current symptoms of depression, alternative or\nadditional treatments were discussed. These could be\npharmacological, psychological or social, with the ratio-\nnale and evidence for any of these being made clear,\nboth in the background literature given to patients and\nin their discussion with the nurses. Social factors, which\ncould be contributing to the chronicity of patients\u2019\ndepression, were explored (e.g. social isolation, low phy-\nsical activity, unemployment, finance, housing) and\nappropriate advice given or referrals to other agencies\nmade. The importance of patient choice and active par-\nticipation in this process and in the treatments selected\nwas emphasised.\nA joint management plan was then formulated\nbetween the nurses and each of their patients and\nreviewed during subsequent appointments, together\nwith a review of how the patient was feeling and any\nprogress made with previous goals set. We aimed to\nteach participants how to monitor their own mental\nstate and to have a sense of possible predictors of\nrelapse. Evidence from other studies indicates this can\nbe helpful [15].\nTiming of intervention appointments\nIntervention patients were seen for a baseline assess-\nment, after one month and then two months later - i.e.\nthree times over the initial 3 months of the study. The\npurpose of having the initial appointments more clo-\nsely spaced was to allow sufficient time for the nurses\nto get to know the patient well and to formulate a\nclear management plan together. After this, the reviews\nfor intervention patients took place 3 monthly for the\nremainder of the 24 month trial period, but could be\nmore frequent if there were any significant clinical\nconcerns about the patients\u2019 mood. Such a flexible\napproach was found helpful in a two-year study with\ngood outcomes, and the arrangements were left to the\ndiscretion of the nurse [15]. If patients were keeping\nwell, it was considered appropriate to conduct this\nreview over the telephone, with evidence from other\nstudies showing this to be feasible [23]. Nevertheless,\nwe asked the nurses to have face-to-face contact with\nparticipants every few appointments. If nurses were\nconcerned about a patient, they were asked to discuss\nthem with the relevant GP, who might also see the\npatient if indicated.\nTreatment as usual\nDuring the 24 month study period the participants in\nthe control arm had \u2018treatment as usual\u2019 and continued\nto see their GP on request, with no restrictions placed\non any interventions which the GP might recommend.\nIt was stipulated that the control arm participants\nshould not see the practice research nurse for any men-\ntal health intervention, although they might see her for\nphysical health problems.\nResearch nurse training sessions\nThe research team provided 4 full days training for all\nthe participating practice nurses as follows:\n\u2022 Day 1: covered the procedures required to recruit\nparticipants to the trial, checking their eligibility (includ-\ning conducting the CIDI interview) and conducting the\ncomputerised randomisation.\n\u2022 Day 2: covered the procedures and information\nrequired for the intervention appointments, including\nassessment of a patient\u2019s level of depression, details of\nevidence based pharmacological and psychological treat-\nments for depression, and the importance of considering\nrelevant social factors.\nBrief training was given in problem solving techniques\nto help patients address some of these difficulties.\n\u2022 Day 3: A further day\u2019s training was arranged after 6\nmonths for the nurses to discuss some of their clinical\ncases, and in particular to focus on ways of working\nwith their more complicated or resistant clients. Brief\ntraining was given in the use of simple motivational\ninterviewing techniques to use with patients finding it\ndifficult to make any changes in their lives [24].\nAll the information from the three training days was\nwritten in a manual for the nurses to take away with\nthem, and they were regularly updated with information\nabout potentially useful resources available. The nurses\nwere also encouraged to ensure that they maintained\naccess to up to date information about appropriate local\nvoluntary and other organisations which they could\nencourage patients to contact where appropriate.\n\u2022 Day 4: This training session was for the procedures\nrequired for the final assessment at 24 months, includ-\ning conducting a further CIDI interview (see further\ndetails below).\nClinical Supervision sessions\nEach nurse was assigned a member of the research team\nas a \u2018clinical supervisor\u2019 (two of these were general prac-\ntitioners with a special interest in mental health and one\nwas a clinical psychologist). Nurses had regular tele-\nphone contact (generally every 3-4 months) with their\nsupervisors throughout the trial period. The format used\nwas a general review, giving nurses the opportunity to\ndiscuss their intervention cases and any concerns they\nmight have, as well as the supervisor making suggestions\nabout possible changes in approach or treatment where\nappropriate. Nurses could also contact their clinical\nsupervisor in between if they had a particular concern\nor query about a patient.\nBuszewicz et al. BMC Psychiatry 2010, 10:61\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-244X\/10\/61\nPage 4 of 9\nOutcome measures\nThe primary outcome measure is the Beck Depression\nInventory (BDI-II). The BDI-II is a reliable and well-\nvalidated measure for measurement of the severity of\ndepression and monitoring its clinical outcome, which\nhas been used in many primary care studies [21]. It will\nalso be involved in the assessment of cost-effectiveness\nas part of the health economic analysis.\nSecondary outcomes (table 1)\n(a) Depression-Free Days: These will be assessed in two\nways. They will be calculated using BDI-II assessment\nscores following the method of Lave et al. [25]. This will\nthen be compared with patients\u2019 self-completed records\nof which days they felt they were significantly depressed,\nto see how a continuous form of data collection com-\npares with a statistical method for assessing persistence\nof depression. (Our feasibility data indicates that\npatients will be prepared to keep such on-going\nrecords).\n(b) Social Functioning: This will be measured using\nthe Work and Social Activity Scale (WASAS). This is a\nwell-established, brief questionnaire, which we will use\nto assess participants\u2019 difficulties with physical and social\nfunctioning associated with their depression [26]. It has\nbeen validated for use in primary care populations with\ndepression.\n(c) Frequency of Depressive Episodes: Will be col-\nlected using the CIDI questionnaire [20]. This instru-\nment is frequently used in psychiatric epidemiological\nstudies and has been modified to allow us to collect\ndiagnostic data on trial participants as regards their\ndepression using DSM-IV criteria for the 36 months\nbefore recruitment as well as the 24 months of the trial.\n(d) Patient personality factors: Participants are asked\nat baseline to complete the Standardised Assessment of\nPersonality - Abbreviated Scale (SAPAS), a brief mea-\nsure of personality variables developed for use in pri-\nmary care [27].\n(e) Quality of life: This will be measured by the Euro-\nquol EQ-5 D, which will generate scores for the cost-\nutility analysis [28].\n(f) Resource use and costs: Data on all services used\nand productivity losses over a retrospective 3-month\nperiod will be collected using a modified version of the\nClient Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI), which has been\nused in numerous economic evaluations, including in\nprimary care populations [29].\n(g) Practice service data: The research nurses will also\nbe asked to count the number of GP attendances and\nhome visits, practice nurse contacts, referrals for psy-\nchological therapy and prescriptions for psychotropic\nmedication for all participants for the 24 months before\nrecruitment and the 24 months of the trial.\nIn order to maintain blindness the final research\nassessment will be carried out by a different person.\nThis may be another nurse at the practice, a MRC\nGPRF regional training nurse or a Mental Health\nResearch Network Clinical Studies Officer. All partici-\npants will be asked at the outset of the final assessment\nnot to reveal their trial arm allocation. As a check on\npotential bias, each practitioner assessing outcome will\nbe asked to record which trial arm they think each\npatient they have assessed was in, to see whether the\nprobability of a correct \u2018guess\u2019 is greater than chance.\nDepression-free Days recorded in Mood Diaries\nFollowing successful piloting in the feasibility study all\nparticipants were asked to complete regular mood dia-\nries, indicating for each day whether they had been\ndepressed or not. This was something that had been\nboth feasible and acceptable for the six months of the\npilot study, but proved overly time-consuming and\nonerous for many participants in the full trial, with\nthe response rate being quite poor after the first\n3 months.\nWe therefore reduced the requirement to completion\nof the diaries for 50% of the project time. An algorithm\nwas constructed, with the 2 years of the trial follow-up\ndivided into eight 3 month portions and participants\nrandomly allocated to receiving the diaries for four of\nthese time periods. Random allocation of diary periods\nmeans that data can be imputed for the whole trial per-\niod and used as a patient record of their depression free\ndays, as well to validate the scores calculated using the\nBDI-II scores by the method of Lave et al. [25].\nThe questionnaires listed were self-completed, apart\nfrom the CIDI which was administered by the research\nnurses in the practices, who also collected the service\nusage data. In order to ensure good response rates,\nTable 1 Frequency of measuring outcome measures\nBDI-\nII\nWASAS CIDI\n(24 months)\nSAPAS EQ-\n5D\nCSRI Service\nData\n(24\nmonths)\nBaseline \u221a \u221a \u221a \u221a \u221a \u221a \u221a\n3\nmonths*\n\u221a\n6\nmonths\n\u221a\n12\nmonths\n\u221a\n18\nmonths\n\u221a\n24\nmonths\n\u221a \u221a \u221a \u221a \u221a \u221a\n* We had initially planned to collect BDI-II questionnaires 3 monthly, but\ndecided this was too onerous for participants and risked a poor response rate,\nso this was altered to 6 monthly from the 6 months time-point\nBuszewicz et al. BMC Psychiatry 2010, 10:61\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-244X\/10\/61\nPage 5 of 9\nparticipants were given a booklet with all the self-com-\npletion questionnaires to fill in when they attended the\nsurgery at baseline and at 24 months for their\nassessments.\nBDI-II questionnaires and mood diaries during the\nintervening two years were posted to all participants\nwith a self-addressed envelope enclosed for their reply.\nA reminder letter and copy of the questionnaire was\nsent after two weeks if participants did not respond. If\nthey failed to return the primary outcome measure, the\nBDI-II, they were telephoned by the practice research\nnurse to prompt them to return the questionnaire.\nProposed sample size\nWe conducted two sample size calculations - for both a\n4 and 5 point difference in the primary outcome mea-\nsure, the BDI-II. In order to detect a 4-point difference\non the BDI-II (assuming a pooled standard deviation of\n11.0) at 90% power and the 5% level of significance, the\nrequired sample size was 318. To meet the objectives of\nthe economic analysis (see details below) data from a\nprevious trial comparing GP care and talking therapies\nshowed a sample size of approximately 200 in each\nstudy arm would be required, rising to 534 using an\nestimated 25% drop-out rate [30].\nTo take account of practice clustering we used an\nintra-class correlation (ICC) of 0.02 which, given an esti-\nmated 12 to 14 patients recruited per practice, inflated\nour sample size to 630 from 47 practices (see table 2\nbelow). We considered this to be a suitable ICC given\nthat a primary care trial with the BDI as the outcome\nfor GPs using cognitive behavioural techniques with\ntheir patients gave an ICC of 0.13 [31].\nA 4 point difference in BDI score would be a conser-\nvative result and is the smallest difference we would\nexpect to achieve. In a previous trial of counselling in\nprimary care the results showed a 5 point difference in\noutcome which is equivalent to a clinically important\ntreatment effect of 0.5 [31].\nWe therefore repeated the same calculations for a dif-\nference in outcome of 5 points on the BDI, which indi-\ncated that we would need 423 participants from as few\nas 32 practices recruiting 12 to 14 patients each. This\nwould also provide sufficient power for a cost-effective-\nness analysis using this outcome.\nPlanned analyses\nAll data will be double entered, using a reputable data\nentering service, blind as to participant group.\nA description of baseline characteristics will be made\nbetween those randomised to the control and interven-\ntion groups.\nAll outcome analyses will include individuals in their\nrandomised arm (intention to treat). Initial descriptive\nstatistics will be used to summarise the differences in\noutcome between the two groups. We will present\nmeans and standard deviations for normally distributed,\ncontinuous variables and medians, with inter-quartile\nranges, for those not normally distributed. Categorical\noutcomes will be presented as frequencies and percen-\ntages within each of the categories.\nObservations at each time point on the same indivi-\ndual will not be independent so a repeated measures\ngeneralised linear model approach will be used [32].\nThis will also allow adjustments to be made for the nat-\nural clustering inherent in the study design. Continuous\noutcomes, which are measured at baseline and at the\nend of follow-up, will be analysed using analysis of cov-\nariance (ANCOVA) to adjust for any differences in base-\nline values [33]. Results will be presented as adjusted\ndifferences in means with 95% confidence intervals and\nassociated p-values. Categorical outcomes will be com-\npared using logistic regression and summarised by com-\nparing the group values of the odds ratios for each\noutcome using 95% confidence intervals and associated\np-values. Statistical techniques will be used to assess the\nimpact of potential missing data [34]. Multiple imputa-\ntion using a predictive model based approach will be\nused to impute missing values [35]. No interim or sub-\ngroup analyses are planned.\nThe impact of clustering by GP and\/or nurse will be\ninvestigated using multi-level modelling. This will\nensure that estimated standard errors of the treatment\neffect will be adjusted for the cluster effects.\nTable 2 Four Point Difference in BDI\nICC Design effect* Total sample size Number of practices required\nRequired With 25% drop-out\n0 1 400 534 40\n0.01 1.09 436 581 44\n0.02 1.18 472 630 47\n0.03 1.27 508 678 51\n0.04 1.36 544 725 54\n0.05 1.45 580 774 58\n*Design effect = 1 + (n-1) \u00d7 ICC, based on clusters with 10 individuals per cluster.\nBuszewicz et al.

Ser-\nvice costs will be calculated by attaching unit costs to\ndata reported on the CSRI using, wherever possible,\nnational unit costs from publicly-available sources or\nestimated using an equivalent approach [36,37]. The ser-\nvice use patterns and associated costs for the two groups\nwill be compared at each time point and changes over\ntime will be analysed using standard non-parametric\ntechniques.\nCost-effectiveness will be assessed using the net-bene-\nfit statistic, a reformulation of the cost-effectiveness\ndecision rule that does not rely on cost-effectiveness\nratios with their associated statistical problems [38].\nThis will allow the cost-effectiveness analysis to be for-\nmulated within a standard regression type framework\n[39]. Inclusion of the EQ-5 D allows a cost-utility\nFigure 2 Consort Diagram: Recruitment and treatment group allocation.\nBuszewicz et al. BMC Psychiatry 2010, 10:61\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-244X\/10\/61\nPage 7 of 9\nanalysis and a cost-effectiveness analysis will link total\ncosts with the primary clinical outcome measure\n(change in the level of depression using the Beck\nDepression Inventory-II) and the number of depression-\nfree days (see above). A cost-consequence analysis will\nexplore the relationship between cost, characteristics,\nneeds and outcome measures [40]. All analyses will take\ninto account cluster effects in practices and sensitivity\nanalyses will check assumptions made in the cost calcu-\nlations and analyses.\nInterim results - Participant recruitment\n3,293 people in the 42 participating practices were iden-\ntified as potentially suitable to take part in the trial\nusing the methods described above and were sent letters\nfrom their practices giving them information about the\nstudy and inviting them to come and discuss this in\nmore detail with the practice research nurses. Most of\nthese potential participants (2,974) were identified via\ndatabase searches, and only small numbers via GP or\nnurse identification (188) or self-referral in response to\npractice posters (34). See Figure 2, the Consort Diagram.\nOf the 3,293 people initially approached, 959 (29%)\nexpressed an interest in attending for the interview and\n828 (25%) actually attended. Following the recruitment\ninterview and assessment 558 people were found eligible\nand agreed to take part in the trial. Using the compu-\nterised randomisation system 276 participants were allo-\ncated to the Control Group and 282 to the Intervention\nGroup. 240 people were found to be ineligible at the\nrecruitment interview stage, 157 because they did not\nscore at least 14 on the BDI-II and 83 because they\nwere ineligible on the CIDI.\nUse of Vouchers\nBecause the response rate for the primary outcome mea-\nsure the BDI-II went down from 72% to 66% between\nthe 3 months and 6 months follow-up points, there was\na concern that this would persist or get worse at later\ntime points and impair the validity of the study results.\nWe therefore decided to reduce the frequency of the\nBDI-II questionnaires to 6 monthly (see frequency table;\ntable 1 above) and to incentivise completion by sending\nparticipants who had returned questionnaires a \u00a3 10\nHigh Street voucher which can be used at many stores\nnationally. Ethical approval was granted for sending of\nthe vouchers, which represented a reimbursement to the\nparticipants for time spent completing and returning the\nquestionnaires.\nAt 12 months the BDI-II response rate was 67%,\nwhich was still not optimal. We therefore changed our\napproach at the 18 month time-point and sent the vou-\nchers at the same time as the BDI-II questionnaires, as\na recent Cochrane review indicated that this may further\nimprove the response rate [41].\nEthical Approval\nThis trial received ethical approval from the Royal Free\nHospital & Medical School Research Ethics Committee\non the 21st February 2007 - REC reference number 07\/\nQ0501\/15. Amendments were approved in July 2007,\nNovember 2008 and May 2009.\nDiscussion\nThis RCT recruited 558 participants within the UK over\na 9-month period. By far the most effective recruitment\nmethod was to use structured searches of general prac-\ntice databases for potential participants, who were then\napproached through a letter, signed by a GP and nurse\nat the practice, which told them about the study and\nasked if they were interested in taking part. Much smal-\nler numbers of participants were recruited through GP\nor nurse recommendations or the leaflets or posters in\nthe surgery encouraging self-referral.\nThe numbers recruited should allow us to demonstrate\na clinically significant effect if the intervention is to be\nhelpful in this population with its significant psychologi-\ncal and functional morbidity. We will review the effect of\nsending participants vouchers at the 12, 18 and 24 month\ntime-points to see whether this has had the desired effect\nof improving the questionnaire return rate.\nAbbreviations\nGP: General Practitioner; MRC GPRF: Medical Research Council General\nPractice Research Framework; CIDI: Composite International Diagnostic\nInterview; BDI-II: Beck Depression Inventory II; DSM IV: Diagnostic and\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition; WASAS: Work and Social\nActivity Scale; SAPAS: Standardised Assessment of Personality - Abbreviated\nScale; CSRI: Client Service Receipt Inventory\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to acknowledge and thank the Big Lottery as the\nfunders of this research and the voluntary organisation Mind who are our\ncollaborators.
