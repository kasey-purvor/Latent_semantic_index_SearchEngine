By the\nend of the decade there were well over twenty 'public planning systems' in\noperation, each with its own timetable, procedure and information demands.\nA number of allocation formulae were evolved to distribute cash and capital\nallocations between geographical areas, and various procedures to improve\nservice coordination were also introduced. Together these innovations have\nhad an important impact on the allocation of social service resources and the\nimplementation of social policies. The first part of the article describes the\ngrowth of such planning activities, while the second part seeks to analyse\ntheir purposes both in terms of the official accounts and from a rather more\ncritical perspective. It is possible to see these changes as attempts by govern-\nment to come to terms with the problem of 'overload' - the tendency for\ndemands on government for more and better services to outrun its and the\neconomy's capacity to respond. They may be seen as more explicit and\ncentralized rationing procedures which seek to combine a realistic apprecia-\nation of budgetary constraints with responsiveness to varied individual and\ncommunity needs. Critics see these procedures as attempts to contain public\nspending by insulating popular demands for improved services in in-\ncreasingly technical and centralized procedures. The article ends by consider-\ning the impact of the new government's public expenditure policy.\nDEFINITIONS\nThe term social planning has varied meanings in a range of distinct litera-\ntures. In the North American social work literature the term is equivalent\nto 'community development' or 'community organisation' and is concerned\n\u2022 This is a revised version of a paper given to a Social Science Research Council workshop\non 'Policy, Planning and Implementation in Social Policy' held at the School for\nAdvanced Urban Studies in Bristol in March, 1979.

Both Abel-\nSmith and Myrdal have used it in this sense.3 Again, it can be used merely\nas a collective noun for the planning of individual social services - education\nplanning and health planning for example. Finally, urban planners have\nused the term to refer to the extension of town planning to encompass a\nwider social brief.4\nThe definition adopted in this paper reflects both this literature and the\ninstitutional developments of the last ten years in Britain. We take social\nplanning to be: the determination of priorities, the allocation of resources\nand the design of service delivery systems undertaken in implementing\nsocial policies. It lies, therefore, midway along a spectrum of decision\nmaking that extends from the formulation of highly generalized social\npolicies at one end to day to day administration at the other. In some areas\nof policy, like social security, where the original legislation and subsequent\nregulations are detailed, the middle phase is less important than in health\ncare or the personal social services where judgements about resource\npriorities and standards are subject to continuing debate and long term\ndecisions must be taken regularly. In functional terms social planning can\nbe seen as the interaction between economic and public expenditure plan-\nning; the planning of individual social services; the conduct of urban and\ntransport planning; and the allocation of resources within and between local\nauthorities.\nIn methodological terms the practice of social planning as it emerged in\nthe 1970s owed its origins to at least five distinct traditions: the scientific\n1\n Two definitions are: 'A way of concerting community influence towards achievement\nof a common goal', f.

It was associated with the aim of building a\nnew social order that would arise from the ruins of war. Abercrombie's\nCounty of London Flan, 1943, The Greater London Plan, 1944, and the New\nTowns movement envisaged a new urban and social order. Beveridge re-\nferred to his report as The Plan for Social Security6 and argued that it was\nonly part of a much wider set of necessary principles of social reconstruction\n- children's allowances, a comprehensive health and rehabilitation service\nand the maintenance of full employment. The Labour Party, at the outset\nat least, was committed to centralized economic planning which was to\nestablish a new economic order. In a policy document presented to, and\napproved by, Annual Conference in 1942 it said: 'The basis of our democracy\nmust be planned production for community use.. .A planned society must\nreplace the old competitive system'.8 In 1947 a Central Planning Staff was\ncreated to draw up a programme of economic recovery and development for\nthe period 1948-52.\nThe whole political philosophy which underlay these attempts at economic\nand social planning was attacked in such classic works as Hayek's The Road\nto Serfdom7 and Jewkes' Ordeal by Planning? The passing strictures of war\nand the government's failure to produce an instant or quickly detectable\nUtopia led to a revulsion against planning, though from our present vantage\npoint one may marvel at what was achieved. Economic planning was only\nresurrected in its temporarily indicative form with the appearance of the\nNational Economic Development Council and the Department of Economic\nAffairs over a decade later. The Utopian vision was never to reappear.\nWhile urban planning survived it became less ambitious in its goals.\nIt was left to writers like Peter Townsend to keep alive the more Utopian\nvision of social planning as a means of restructuring society.9\n5\n Social Insurance and Allied Services (Beveridge Report), Cmd 6404, HMSO, London, 1942,\npara. 17.\n0\n Quoted in A.

They were mainly the result\nof central government departments' concern to promote or guide building\nprogrammes: for schools (1944, 1958), hospitals (1962), technical (1956) and\nhigher education (1963), and housing (1965).10 Sometimes central govern-\nment sought to prompt local authorities into action, for example in extend-\ning community care.11 There were various, rather unsuccessful, attempts at\nmanpower planning for teachers and doctors.12 However, it was the intro-\nduction and gradual extension of the system of public expenditure planning\nand control (PESC) after 1961, and especially after 1968, which forced\ncentral departments to justify their bids for resources from the Treasury\nwith broader forecasts of the costs and demands on their services for the\nmedium term, and to begin to make conscious decisions about future\npriorities within set budget constraints.13 Then, in the 1970s, central depart-\nments began to extend this process downwards to local authorities, regional\nand area health authorities and nationalized industries.\nSocial planning developments in the 1970s fall under three broad head-\nings. First the gradual establishment of service based or 'vertical' planning\nsystems linking central government and local agencies within which\nlocalities are asked to produce plans which are consistent with central\ngovernment's public expenditure strategies. Second, attempts at inter-\nservice and inter-departmental collaboration. Third, the use of territorial\nindicators of relative need to allocate resources between different geo-\ngraphical areas.\nService based planning systems\nThe introduction of the transport policies and programmes procedure in the\nearly 1970s set the pattern. This procedure was, it was claimed, designed to\n10\n Education Act 1044, section n , and Secondary Education for AH, Ministry of Education,\nCmnd 604, HMSO, London, 1958; The Hospital Plan for England and Wales, Cmnd 1604,\nHMSO, London, 1962; Technical Education, Ministry of Education and Secretary of\nState for Scotland, Cmd 9703, HMSO, London, 1956; Higher Education, Committee on\nHigher Education, Cmd 2154, HMSO, London, 1963; The Housing Programme 1965-1970,\nMinistry of Housing and Local Government, Welsh Office, Cmd 2838, HMSO, London,\n1965.\n11\n Health and Welfare: The Development of Community Care, Ministry of Health, Cmnd\n1973, HMSO, London, 1963.\n12\n The Supply and Demand for Teachers, 1963-1986 (Bullock Report), 9th Report of the\nNational Advisory Council on the Training and Supply of Teachers, Department of\nEducation and Science, HMSO, London, 1965; Report of the Inter-Departmental Com-\nmittee on Medical Schools (Chairman Sir William Goodenough), Ministry of Health and\nDepartment of Health for Scotland, HMSO, London, 1944; Report of the Committee to\nConsider the Future Number of Medical Practitioners (Willinck Report), Ministry of\nHealth and Department of Health for Scotland, HMSO, London, 1957; Royal Commission\non Medical Education 1965-8, Cmd 3569, HMSO, London, 1968.\n18\n H.

The Housing Investment Programmes\n(HIPs) were closely modelled on this precedent. Housing authorities have\nalways had to seek loan sanction approval for new house building, and for\nslum clearance and improvement schemes. They also had a duty to review\nhousing conditions in their area. The Labour Government, in 1977, pro-\nduced the results of its long awaited housing policy review, and one of the\nfew concrete proposals was the intention that:\nEach local authority should draw up a strategic statement backed by statistics on\nthe local housing stock and households and expected changes over the next few\nyears and a programme for its own proposed housing investment. In working out\nthe local housing strategy, local authorities will need to take account of policies\nin other fields - such as transport and employment, health and social services.15\nOnce again ministers claimed the new system would combine overall control\nof the level of spending with greater freedom for local councils to choose\ntheir own priorities.\nUnder the HIPs procedure, which was first adopted for the 1978\/9\nfinancial year, local housing authorities make bids for permission to under-\ntake a capital programme one year ahead, the total size of which must be\nconsistent with the provision for housing investment in the public expendi-\nture white paper for the relevant year. The bids must be backed by a written\nstatement of the authority's housing strategy and relevant statistics on\ndwellings and households over a four year period. The bid covers new house\nbuilding, slum clearance, improvement of council houses and acquisitions -\nall coming within one 'block' of public sector spending. Another block\ncovers the private sector, improvement grants and loans for house purchase,\nand a third block covers housing associations. Separate approval for each\nblock is required though some movement between them is possible.\nThe National Health Service planning system developed on somewhat\nsimilar lines. In the early 1970s the DHSS developed a programme budget\nstructure which allocated expenditure between broad client groups and\nprovided some basis on which to forecast demands posed by each. It was a\nsignificant methodological advance in planning method though far from the\n14\n Circular 104\/73, Department of the Environment, 1973.\n15\n Housing Policy: A Consultative Document, Cmnd 6851, HMSO, London, 1977, paras.\n6.05 and 6.06.\n36 Howard Glennerster\nambitious goals set by its American originators.16 It enabled the Secretary\nof State to set out service priorities in two consultative documents in 1976\nand 1977, setting norms and suggested growth rates which could be trans-\nlated into guidelines sent by DHSS to regional health authorities. In the\nlight of this guidance area and regional health authorities are supposed to\nmake strategic (10-15 year) and operational (3 year) plans according to\ndetailed instructions and a tight timetable. These are then passed upwards\nto the next tier for revision and approval. As a result future guidelines may\nbe relaxed or amended to meet the practical constraints shown up in the last\nround of plans.17 However, the actual allocation of funds to regions is based\non a quite separate basis discussed below. The Merrison Commission on the\nNHS clearly found the whole process somewhat difficult to understand:\nEven after listening to careful explanation by representatives of DHSS about the\nway in which the needs of particular priority groups are taken into account in\nthe allocation of resources to health authorities, we remain mystified.18\nTwo of the research reports undertaken for the Commission, by Kogan and\nKorman and the team from Warwick, were critical of aspects of the plan-\nning system: its complexity; the difficulties caused by uncertain and chang-\ning resource constraints; and deficiencies in information and methods.19\nIn their consultative document Fatients First the new Conservative Govern-\nment suggested that while it broadly approved the attempt at planning the\nsystem was to be 'simplified'.20\nRunning in parallel to the NHS system but very different in nature were\nthe local authority social service departments (SSDs) planning statements\nto the DHSS. In 1962 and 1972 local authorities were asked to prepare\n10 year plans for community social services. Both turned out to be largely\npaper exercises, the last, in particular, based on unrealistic guidelines about\navailable resources, but, in 1977, the DHSS tried again, SSDs were asked\n16\n Glennerster, op. cit.; G.

Again 'norms' were recommended\nby the DHSS for separate client groups (typically workers or places per\n1,000 population).21 Central government does not directly finance these\nservices. It merely contributes indirectly through the Rate Support Grant.\nThe procedure was seen both as a way of guiding SSDs forward thinking in\nways that conformed to DHSS priorities, providing information used by the\ndepartment in its negotiations with the Treasury and Department of the\nEnvironment for PESC and the Rate Support Grant settlement, and no doubt\nas some basis for deciding loan sanction approval. The procedure was dis-\ncontinued in 1979.22\nThe relationships between the Department of Education and Science and\nlocal education authorities (LEAs) remained largely unaffected by such\nformal planning systems. In fact, educational planning developed rather\nearlier. The Robbins Committee's long term projections of demand for\nplaces in higher education were regularly revised by the DES.23 The one\noverall attempt at planning was conducted within the DES almost entirely\nin secret by the Department's own planning organization.24 A procedure\nand a system roundly criticized by both OECD examiners and a House of\nCommons committee.25 Once again an important tool was a programme\nbudget, but school building schemes were still approved on an individual\nbasis. Reorganization schemes urged on, and finally required of LEAs under\nthe Education Act, 1976 were the nearest the DES came to requiring long\nterm plans from local authorities. This department, despite its early pioneer-\ning in educational planning in the 1960s, remained aloof from the fashion-\nable rush into planning systems.\nThe 1970s, therefore, ended with a complex array of service planning\n21\n See the requests for p lann ing statements: Circular LASSL (77) 13, Depar tment of Health\nand Social Security, 1977; Circular LASSL (78) 19, Depar tment of Health and Social\nSecurity, 1978; and an analysis of the 1977 re turns in Local Author i ty Fersonal Social\nServices Summary of Planning Returns 1976-7 and 1979-80, Depar tment of Health and\nSocial Security, 1978.\n22\n For a more detailed account of these various at tempts see Booth, op. cit.\n23\n The last published example was Higher Education in the 1990s: A Discussion Document,\nFebruary 1978, b u t also see the education section in the annua l public expenditure whi te\npapers.

The general tendency of the\ninnovations was to increase the compartmentalism of service delivery\nsystems emphasizing the vertical links between service administrators at\nlocal, regional and central levels. Yet, during the same decade there were\nalso various attempts to increase inter-service cooperation, corporate and\njoint planning, both within central government and at the local level.\nInter service coordination\nIn his review of the record of the 1964-70 Labour Government in the social\npolicy field Townsend concluded that one reason for its relative failure to\nmake any major impact on inequality was the absence of any means by\nwhich the separate activities of government in the field of taxation, incomes\npolicy and the social services could be drawn together. What was needed, as\nhe argued, was:\na strong research, information and planning unit, perhaps under a Social\nAdvisory Council, with direct responsibility to the Prime Minister, which has\nthe job of converting the social objectives of government into an operational\nprogramme. This unit would undertake research on social conditions and needs,\nmonitor the social effects of changes in fiscal, incomes and social service policies\nand produce forward plans.20\nThe Joint Framework for Social Policies, evolved by the Central Policy\nReview Staff (CPRS) in 1975,27 was a tentative attempt at an inter-depart-\nmental approach to social policy within central government. There were to\nbe fairly infrequent meetings between social policy ministers to review\nlonger term issues and trends, and a series of studies undertaken by CPRS of\nareas of joint concern. The meetings of senior ministers fell into abeyance.\nThe whole initiative, limited though it was, seems to have been scaled down\nover time. A few brief papers have been published, for example on housing,\ncentral-local relations, population trends and education and industrial train-\ning.28 Evidently more pungent and critical papers have not been published.\nWithin local authorities there were also some attempts to adopt a more\n26\n Peter Townsend, 'Social p lann ing and the control of priori t ies ' , in P.

Social Planning in the Seventies 39\ncorporate and less departmental approach. There were essentially two\nstrands to the set of changes proposed by the corporate reformers. The first\nwas an attempt to adapt the essential elements of rational comprehensive\nplanning, embodied in the concept of planning programming and budgeting\nto a British local government context. Part of this approach entailed\nstrengthening the strategic coordinating function of the authority by the\nappointment of a Chief Executive the creation of a chief officers' group or\nteam, and the establishment of a Policy and Resources Committee of mem-\nbers. A central analytic capacity was frequently added in the form of a\ncorporate planning section. The second strand, similar to that found in the\nSeebohm and NHS reforms, was the goal of improved interdepartmental\ncoordination. Following the political changes in local government in the late\n1960s, and the reorganization of local government, these ideas spread to\nmany of the new authorities encouraged by both the Bains Report and the\nwork of Professor Stewart and others at INLOGOV.20 The trend continued\nwith some setbacks until at least 1977. There were other attempts at inter-\nservice cooperation on a less grand scale. The institution of joint planning\narrangements between health authorities and local authorities - especially\nsocial services departments - was the main example.\nTerritorial allocation procedures\nOne of the most significant methodological innovations of the decade was\nthe increasing use of statistical indicators to allocate resources between\ngeographical areas according to some measure of comparative need. The\nconcept of territorial justice and indices of comparative need had first been\nexplored in this country by Bleddyn Davies in the late 1960s.30 In the\nfollowing decade indicators came to be used by government for three pur-\nposes: to help distinguish authorities to be given exceptional assistance\nbecause of the unusual concentration of social problems they faced; to pro-\nvide a basis for allocating grants of a more general kind to local and health\n20\n For some of the early arguments see: New local Authorities Management and Structure\n(Bains Report), Department of the Environment, HMSO, London, 1972; J.

The\nneeds element in the Rate Support Grant came to be distributed according to\na complex formula that reflected the tendency of local authorities to spend\nmore on different categories of their population. But perhaps the best\nexample of the contribution which this methodology can make to attaining\nterritorial justice is the report of the Resource Allocation Working Party for\nthe Health Service (RAWP) and the similar reports for Scotland, Wales and\nNorthern Ireland. The committee saw its task as finding a means of reducing\n'the disparities between the different parts of the country in terms of the\nopportunity for access to health care of people at equal risk'.32 It could be\nsaid that this had been one of the primary aims of the NHS at its inception.\nThe failure to achieve any significant narrowing of geographical inequalities\nin access to hospital care especially, may be variously laid at the door of\nentrenched medical interests and the sheer inertia of incremental budgeting\npractices. Even with the political will to change this situation little might\nhave happened without the technical means of quantifying the extent to\nwhich resources would have to be redeployed in order to make equal access\na reality. This is not to suggest that the measures themselves were un-\ncontentious. A voluminous literature now exists disputing the use of\nstandardized mortality ratios, rather than morbidity data; the assumption\nthat equal funding alone will lead to equal access; the costing of teaching\nand research functions; and much else.33 Nevertheless, it has provided a\nbasis for rational debate and a practical, if complex, allocative tool. Finally,\nsome authorities have used an index of deprivation to distribute additional\nresources within their localities to different areas or schools with potentially\nmore demanding pupils, as part of a policy of positive discrimination.34\nThe index produced by the Inner London Education Authority turned a\ngeneral principle into an administrative fact.\n31\n A.

Social Planning in the Seventies 41\nIn all, therefore, the 1970s were a decade of significant innovation in the\ntechniques of resource allocation and attempts at forward planning in the\nsocial services, but this took place against a background of tightening ex-\npenditure constraints and the two were not unrelated. How is it possible to\nview these new arrangements?\nOFFICIAL AND CRITICAL ACCOUNTS\nBy analysing the official descriptions and justifications that have accom-\npanied many of the new planning procedures, and the academic work of its\nadvocates, it is possible to piece together a reasonably coherent account of\ntheir place and purpose. Equally, a critical literature began to emerge at the\nend of the decade questioning the overt purposes of the new procedures and\nsuggesting more critical accounts of what was happening. They can be\ngrouped in each case, into three broad intellectual traditions, each of the\nofficial accounts paralleled by a comparable 'unauthorized' version.\nOfficial Critical\n(1) Social planning as social Social planning as colonizing the\nlearning. future.\n(2) Social planning as the Social planning as legitimating\nrational determination of cuts in public spending - a\nsocial priorities - a response response to 'fiscal crisis'.\nto 'government overload'.\n(3) Social planning as the Social planning as constrained\ncoordination of social bargaining between service\nprovision. providers.\nSocial planning as social learning\nIt is this perspective that dominates the official accounts. Planning is seen as\nthe means by which public bodies learn systematically about their environ-\nment, the problems and needs of a local community or relevant client groups.\nWhile feedback from the local real world system can be obtained from\nauthority members, pressure groups, professionals and participation exer-\ncises, these give only a partial viewpoint. A more systematic search for\ninformation about its environment will help the authority adapt effectively\nto the changing needs of its area or clients.\nPublic learning.. .involves public institutions actively seeking out problems and\nopportunities in the community and responding creatively to these challenges by\ncontinuously adapting ongoing institutional behaviour.35\nThis quotation refers to local authority policy planning, but a similar\n35\n Hambleton, op. cit.\n42 Howard Glcnncrster\nphilosophy lies behind the stated objectives of the NHS planning system.\nIt goes further than most in setting out its broad philosophy and defining its\nterms. It begins, 'Planning can be defined as deciding how the future pattern\nof activities should differ from the present, identifying the changes neces-\nsary to accomplish this, and specifying how these changes should be brought\nabout'.36 In a diagram headed 'N.H.S. planning is a learning process' an\niterative process is pictured beginning with 'definition of aims' continuing\nthrough 'review of existing state of services' to 'selection of options in the\nlight of resource availability' to 'implementation, monitoring, evaluating,\nreconsideration of aims'.37 This view owes its origins to systems theory and\ncybernetics. The sequence of its intellectual antecedents will be familiar to\nthose who recall the planning, programming, budgeting literature of the\n1960s, but in its stress on the identification of the 'problems and needs of\npeople' it also draws upon the terminology and the rhetoric of social\nadministration. The process is meant to be a circular one, DHSS not merely\ngiving guidelines but adapting them in the light of the detailed information\nit receives from the regions. In practice, the system seems to have relied\nmuch more on the guidelines from the centre than feedbacks from the field.\nThe regional health authorities strategic plans for the next ten to fifteen\nyears had to conform to a pattern laid down by the DHSS.\nA letter to regional health authorities in 1978 attached a set of standard\ntables designed to 'summarise the effects of the strategy selected on central\nresource assumptions'.38 These 'SASP tables' were not only to form part of\nthe regions' submission to the DHSS but also were to go to area health\nauthorities to provide a framework for their strategic planning up to\n1988\/9. They began with population estimates, and then for each broad\nclient group or group of services that corresponded to the Department's\nprogramme budget categories the regions were asked, where appropriate, to\nestimate the number of cases, the probable 'throughput' and unit costs for\n1976, 1981, and 1988. This provided the basis for estimating the level of\nprovision aimed at in each of these years. Manpower and capital spending\nestimates, categorized in different ways, were also asked for. Just how\nregions obtained these figures was their business, but the very form of the\ninstructions concentrated the mind almost entirely in terms of marginal\nchanges to input ratios, and population trends. The area health authorities\nhad to try to work within the resource constraints and guidelines set by\nregion but they and the districts had the task of matching resources to the\nneeds of their area. Slowly the areas and districts began to set up planning\n30\n The NHS Planning System, op. cit. p. 4.\n37\n Ibid, figure 3, p. 9.\nas Letter to Regional Administrators, Department of Health and Social Security, 11 January\n1978.\nFrom Containment to Conflict? Social Planning in the Seventies 43\ngroups for some of the priority client groups like the mentally handicapped\nand ill, the elderly and children, but by the time they began to report there\nwas little if any money to allocate to the schemes they were advocating.\nThe HIPs returns, in addition to requesting a general statement of the\ncouncil's housing strategy, asked for a summary of housing needs in their\narea which justified their requests for a capital allocation over a four-year\nperiod. Needs were to be calculated from a crude household-dwelling balance\n- households plus 'concealed' households requiring a dwelling set against\nthe housing stock taking account of vacancies and second homes. Only the\nmost crude guesses could be made by most authorities about even these\nfigures. To them were added the authorities' estimates of need for limited\nspecial categories of housing - sheltered housing, for example - but the\ndisaggregation of needs was very limited. The information was enough to\nenable the regional offices of the DOE, using a formula and their own\njudgement, to allocate their part of the total PESC housing allocation.\nThe local authority personal social service planning returns, in addition\nto a narrative account of future priorities and patterns of care, asked for\ninformation on the existing levels of provision - residential or day care -\ndistinguishing between the various client groups, such as the elderly,\nmentally handicapped, mentally ill and children. Also illustrative projec-\ntions of current and capital spending, and population projections by age\ngroup were requested.\nAs these examples show, the nature of the planning information con-\ntained in the national returns was fairly crude and largely concerned with\ninputs of capital or manpower. They clearly provided some yardstick by\nwhich central government could compare one area with another to allocate\nfunds or use as the basis for Rate Support Grant allocations. The learning\nelement as far as central government was concerned was minimal. That\nshould not obscure the fact that some health authorities, local departments\nand corporate planning groups were beginning to make attempts to seek out\nclient needs and measure them in an imaginative way, but the experiences\nwere varied and the methods in an early stage of development even by 1980.\nFor many critics the dominance of the centre and the weakness of the learn-\ning mode is no accident.\nColonizing the future\nThe Swedish writer Ake Sandberg, in his book The Limits to Democratic\nPlanning, argues that planning methodology itself, particularly trend plan-\nning, reflects the dominant interests in society, and helps to foreclose future\noptions in their favour by persuading politicians to view the future through\nthe eyes of these dominant interests. 'The colonisation of the future means\n44 Howard Glcnnerster\nthat today's powerful interests organised in established institutions, prolong\nthe prevailing situation into the future'.39 They do this through planning\nmethods that produce self fulfilling prophecies or by de-politicizing policy\ndecisions by mystifying them in complex mathematical modelling. It is not\nnecessary to accept the whole case to see that important issues are being\nraised here about the relationship between established interests, information\nand planning method. Perhaps the most obvious example is the forecasts\nmade by urban planners of traffic demands which, by extending the net-\nwork of roads for the benefit of the private motorist, helps to prove the\nforecasts right. Similar criticisms can be made of the planning methods used\nby the DES for higher education. They have been wholly concerned with\nestimating the demand for places from school leavers generated by existing\ntrends which, in the 1970s, involved widening inequality of access. Health\nplanning now seems to be dominated by the bed-population norm or staffing\nratio concept for periods up to ten years ahead. The goal of the new regional\nstrategic health plans seems to be to achieve convergence towards national\nnorms. If we had some efficiency criterion for adopting these norms in the\nfirst place the process might be less worrying. As it is there must be fears\nabout producing an even less adaptive or responsive service. Planning for\npreventive medicine is virtually non-existent. Thus existing interests in the\nmedical care system are indeed laying claim to future resources. Moreover,\nmany of the new methods evolved in health planning are predicated on\nthe existence of a centralized and powerful decision-taker. They are\nextremely complex and can inhibit external criticism.40\nThese Marxist critiques of planning method have to be set alongside the\ncriticisms levelled at the centralizing consequences of the related organ-\nizational changes in local government. In an account of changes in local\ngovernment organization Dearlove suggests that the democraticization of\nlocal government increased working class power at the local level and hence\nmade it more difficult for the dominant interests in society to control local\ngovernment spending.41 Corporate planning and the larger scale of authori-\nties were designed to contain such spending and to reduce the 'relative\nautonomy' of local government from the dominant interests in society.\nCockburn developed similar arguments from a case study in Lambeth.42\nDearlove's earlier detailed study of 'policy maintenance' in Kensington and\n39\n A Sandberg, The Limits to Democratic Planning, Liberforlag, Stockholm, 1977.\n40\n The case is argued by J.

Social Planning in the Seventies 45\nChelsea illustrated the extent to which councillors can isolate themselves\nfrom any external sources of information and pressure that run counter to\ntheir existing values and presumptions about the world.43 Politicians only\nhear or learn what they want to learn. Castells sees urban planning as the\ntechnical forum within which the dominant and the working class interests\nbattle for power. He argues that urban planning methods in France 'act as\nan instrument of negotiation and mediation for, on the one hand, the\ndominant classes and their differing demands for the realization of their\ncommon interests, and on the other, pressures and protests of the dominated\nclasses'.\"\nMarxists are not the only critics of current planning methodology.\nFrom the opposite ideological perspective equally critical questions are asked\nabout the interests that are reflected in the very nature of planning methods\nused. In this view social planning is merely one more factor reinforcing the\ngrowth of government or defending it from attack; it commits governments\nto future spending, and mobilizes professional and client group support.\nNiskanen and later writers from the public choice school of American\neconomists argue that budget allocations reflect the interests of senior\nadministrators who will gain in income, power or status terms by larger or\nmore manpower-intensive budgets.45 At the moment this 'theory' remains\nlargely speculative, but it is not necessary to accept the whole elaborate set\nof assumptions which are adapted to USA, and particularly Washington,\npolitics to see that it raises questions of significance for social planning.\nIn particular, it makes us ask questions about the self interest and profes-\nsional interest of those who generate, use and exclude information from the\nplanning process. Certainly much of current social service planning that is\ndominated by input norms and staffing ratios is entirely consistent with\npublic choice theory. Perhaps the classic example is the idea of extrapolating\na steadily rising and apparently exponential trend in the doctor patient\nquotient through to the next century regardless of the budgetary con-\nsequences, which we find in the Royal Commission on Medical Education\nin 1968, an approach only partly revised in more recent attempts to suggest\nappropriate medical manpower requirements.48\n43\n J.

The DHSS describes its\nprogramme budget, which forms the starting point of its planning system,\nin the following way:\nIts central purpose is to enable the Department to cost policies for service develop-\nment across the board so that priorities can be considered within realistic financial\nconstraints.47\nMuch the same could be said of HIPs which enable the Department of the\nEnvironment to exercise priority between spending on improvement and\nnew building. RAWP and the other territorial allocation formulae are\ngeographical rationing devices just as most of the vertical planning systems\ncan be viewed as examples of more explicit financial or capital rationing\nsystems.\nDuring the 1960s and early 1970s public expenditure grew in relation to\nthe economy as a whole, and came to be seen as a major economic 'problem'.\nSome political scientists argued that the high expectations and political\ndemands being placed on the system for improved services were unrealistic\nand that the subsequent disappointments were tending to undermine\nsupport for the system of government itself. This became known as the\n'overload thesis'.48 Within that framework it is possible to see the develop-\nment of the national planning system and allocation procedures as ways of\ntaking the heat off government. Publications like the DHSS priorities docu-\nment helped to educate the medical profession into the realities of limited\nresources and force a consideration of options and priorities. The emphasis\nin the planning systems on realistic resource guidelines helped to damp\ndown future expectations. The 'objectivity' of the allocation formulae like\nRAWP helped to deflect some of the political hostility and debate that\nmight have arisen, significant though it was.\nContaining the fiscal crisis\nA different interpretation can be put on essentially the same events. In this\nanalysis capitalist states in the West, and most noticeably the USA and\nBritain, began to face the consequences of internally inconsistent tendencies.\nThe need for more extensive public spending to sustain investment and\nlegitimate the capitalist system was in conflict with the system's incapacity\nsame authors ' evidence to the Royal Commission, Doctor Manpower 1975-2000: alterna-\ntive forecasts and their resource implications (Royal Commission on the National Health\nService, Research Paper No. 4), HMSO, London, 1978.\n47\n Priorities for Health ad Fersonal Social Services in England, op. cit. p . 78.\n48\n See R. Rose and G. Peters, Can Government Co Bankrupt? Macmillan, Basingstoke, 1978.\nFrom Containment to Conflict? Social Planning in the Seventies 47\nto finance such spending through higher taxation. This, by now well\nknown account by James O'Connor,48 could be said to form the background\nto the developments described earlier. The increasing use of the public\nexpenditure system and the derived planning systems for the purposes of\ncontrol, containment and finally cuts in spending are consistent with such\nan account. Social planning comes to be seen as the means of legitimizing\ncuts in public expenditure. The instructions to health authorities on the\nnature of planning contained in the NHS Planning System emphasized the\nneed for 'realism'. 'Planners should be on their guard against unrealistic\nresource assumptions' and 'avoid making unrealistic demands for finance\nand manpower'.50 The guidelines from the DHSS to both the NHS and local\nauthorities set out roughly how much more money they can expect to spend\nin the period of the Public Expenditure White Paper or longer. The Rate\nSupport Grant settlements came to stress expected levels of spending for\neach service. Some critics have seen both RAWP and the priorities document\nas no more than disguises or legitimations for cuts.51\nAt the local level corporate planning can be seen as the way in which\nchief officers or the party leaders have sought to get 'a handle on' the\nbudget. Yet, taken on its own, this will hardly suffice. Some of the highest\nspending and growth-oriented authorities are firm adherents of corporate\nplanning. HIPs and NHS plans can as readily be seen as legitimizing the\nneed for more spending. Such general assumptions need more local com-\nparative study before they can stand as more than assertions.\nSocial planning as coordination\nThere is a strong tendency for social services to be provided in distinct and\nunrelated packages despite their interdependent effects and clients' inter-\nrelated needs. The factors causing such fragmentation are inherent in the\nvery nature of social services. There is no profit motive to induce the doctor,\nthe social worker and teacher to co-operate as there is in the case of a\nplumber, carpenter and plasterer who, albeit rather erratically, manage to\nrepair my house. Each social service agency has its own set of loyalties and\nperceptions of the world. The natural organizational differentiation is re-\ninforced by legal responsibilities which are almost entirely service based and\nwhich largely determine any statutory authority's view of its responsi-\nbilities. Moreover, agencies are also professionally distinct. The social service\ndepartments' perceptions are those of the social work profession. The health\nauthority has a medical view. Each department in a local authority is\n48\n J. O'Connor, The Fiscal Crisis of the State, St. Martin's Press, London, 1973.\n50\n The NHS Planning System, op. cit. p . 4.\n51\n Radical Statistics Group, Whose Priorities?, London, 1978.\n48 Howard Glennerster\nengaged in a battle for resources which can only be gained at the cost of\nanother department. The importance of countering these tendencies is clear.\nThe joint planning procedures between health and personal social services,\ncorporate planning, the experiments with area management, regional\nchildren's committees, the Joint Framework for Social Policies were all\nattempts to achieve results through giving some body or committee the role\nof 'strategic coordinator' - or 'coordination by overview' as Lindblom has\ncalled it - a superior coordinating body designed to bring together\nsubordinate agencies.62 The CPRS document, A Joint Frame-work for Social\nPolicies, actually called the group of social policy ministers who were to\nmeet at regular intervals a 'strategic' forum.53 It is not a procedure that has\nproved notably successful. Similar difficulties have arisen with corporate\nstrategies in local government,54 and joint planning.55\nSocial planning as constrained bargaining\nThe relatively poor showing of the 'strategic coordinator' mode fits well\nenough into Lindblom's critique of this form of inter-organizational co-\noperation. The inter-actions are too complex to be ordered by a central\ncommittee, he argues. Divergent interests are ignored. If co-operation is in\nthe mutual interests of two departments or agencies it will take place\nnaturally. If it is not in their interests no co-ordinating committee can\nsucceed. In fact such agencies proceed through a process he calls partisan\nmutual adjustment (PMA). He then goes on to analyse and categorize PMA\nunder various headings. The categories are helpful in thinking about the\nnature of interdepartmental relations. One may act without any regard to\nanother. An area health authority could close an old peoples' hospital\nwithout warning or discussion with the local authority. A housing depart-\nment may frame its housing investment strategy with no regard to the social\nservices or education department, or it may act without formal collaboration\nto avoid unpleasant consequences for the other agency. This process\nLindblom calls adaptive mutual adjustment. There are other more interactive\nforms:\n(1) straightforward bargaining (for example about inter-authority flows\nof patients);\n(2) a shift of appreciation achieved through the exchange of information\nabout the other authorities' future intentions, some joint planning\nbetween the NHS and social service departments is of this kind;\n52\n C. Lindblom, The Intelligence of Democracy, The Free Press, N e w York, 1965.\n53\n A Joint Framework for Social Policies, op. cit. p . 6.\n64\n Dearlove, The Reorganisation of British Local Government, op. cit.\n65\n Booth, op. cit.\nFrom Containment to Conflict? Social Planning in the, Seventies 49\n(3) compensation - financial inducements by one authority to another -\njoint finance might fall under this heading;\n(4) reciprocity - one organization undertakes to do something in return\nfor some future benefit from others - the regional agreements about\nspecial provision for children might fall under this heading;\n(5) authoritative prescription - one department accepts the other's pro-\nfessional judgement - a site for a school or home might be deemed\nunsuitable on environmental or design grounds;\n(6) unconditional manipulation - one department simply tries to out-\nmanoeuvre the other.\nGuidelines, cash limits and expenditure planning can be seen as the\nintroduction of certain rules into the budget or planning 'game' which\nmake it possible for mutual adjustment and bargaining to take place without\nrecourse to the easiest option - raising the total level of spending to\naccommodate everyone's claims. However, the theory needs considerable\ndevelopment to test its applicability to the social planning context. Who are\nthe 'partisans'? How do we identify them and their interests? Do they have\nan explicit bargaining agenda? How are bargains arrived at? What is the\ncurrency? How is it traded? Can we identify how much is given up by\nwhom to gain what? What impact does the introduction of, or changes in,\nthe rules of the game make? What factors inhibit adjustments and what\npromote them and in whose interests?\nFriend, Power and Yewlett60 sought to adapt some of these ideas in opera-\ntional research terms, and in the urban planning context, using the idea of\ndecision networks which could be fostered by 'cultivating a network of\nhuman relationships' and contacts. This view puts great faith on the effect\nof information and personal persuasion to break down organizational\nbarriers \u2014 only one of Lindblom's categories. As critics have pointed out this\nmisses out the power dimension. It is not enough for the other part to be\ninformed, its interests, professional and bureaucratic, have to be satisfied if\ncollaboration is to happen.67\nTOWARDS CONFLICT?\nWe have, therefore, two rather different views about the growth of social\nservice planning systems in the past decade. One sees more formal planning\nas a response to the scale and complexity of the tasks heaped on government\n08\n J. K. Friend, J. M. Power and C. J. L. Yewlett, Public Planning in the Inter-Corporate\nDimension, Tavistock, London, 1974.\n07\n P.

As government grew and local\nauthorities became larger they came to need more elaborate Listening\ndevices, and means of making difficult choices and cooperation with agencies\nundertaking related tasks. As resource constraints grow so the need for\nplanning will become evident.\nOn the other hand it has been argued that whatever the ideals the\nprocedures have had more to do with control than responsiveness. The effect\nof tightening resource constraints is likely to reduce concern with building\nnew futures - the basis of much planning practice. Even increments for\ngrowth have gone. Thus the will to participate in planning will evaporate.\nIn periods of expansion central government was prepared to initiate explicit\nplanning because it could take credit for any intended improvements.\nIf there are to be cuts only in the future no government will want to take\nthe blame.\nHow will social planning survive the harsher climate of the 1980s?\nSome commentators have concluded that it will encourage greater 'ration-\nality'. Without a regular increment to distribute it is argued that local\nauthorities will be forced to consider their base spending and make hard\nchoices. It will become more important to consider the relative effectiveness\nof different programmes or activities. Authorities and professionals will be\nforced to question the purpose of many of the things they traditionally do.\nServices will emerge, as from a health farm, toned up, slimmed down,\naltogether more effectively planned and coordinated. This is a logical\nposition for a 'strategic cordinator' to take but it is balanced by opposing\ninterests with their own logics. How do we suppose politicians in central\ngovernment will react faced with the commitment to make the maximum\ncuts in spending but combined, we must presume, with the minimum of\npolitical unpopularity both for their party nationally and for themselves as\nspending ministers?\nTwo eminently logical strategies appeared to be emerging by early 1980.\nFirst, if you have to cut, cut someone else's budget not your own. Local\ngovernment was to bear the major burden of cuts while central government\nspending continued to rise. Second, obscure the issue - use unrealistic cash\nlimits to cut spending and let inflation do the work.58 In this way the\nresponsibility for making hard choices is devolved to the local authorities\nor health districts, and to the professionals in the front line. The unpre-\ndictability of such an approach in an inflationary period makes even plans a\nyear ahead uncertain. Moreover, it is a game that two can play for local\nauthorities will wish to make clear where the political responsibility lies.\n58\n For more on this theme see H. Glennerster, 'Prime Cuts: Public Expenditure and Social\nService Planning in a Hostile Environment', Policy and Politics, 8:4 (October 1980).\nFrom Containment to Conflict? Social Planning in the Seventies 51\nThus the opposing political logic calls for central\/local confrontations and\npolitical conflict.\nThe planning systems developed in the mid-1970s depended crucially on\nsome degree of certainty about medium term resource constraints - on the\nvolume figures in the public expenditure white paper. As these become\nmeaningless with the imposition of unrealistic cash limits so the whole\npurpose of the exercise is undermined. By the beginning of 1980 there were\nsigns that this was in fact happening. The March 1980 public expenditure\nfigures were less detailed than previously and focused on the year ahead.69\nThe personal social service planning statements had been discontinued.\nThe health service planning system was to be 'simplified' and was not in\npractice working at the local level in many instances. The last HIPs returns\nby authorities had been so severely cut as to produce a near standstill in\npublic housing in 1980. A further effect of tight financial constraints may\nwell be to reduce inter-agency cooperation.
