This new era has profound \neconomic, social, cultural and educational implications, because it challenges the \nintellectual assumptions of entrepreneurship and changes the influences of cultural \nvalues on it. We need to assess how entrepreneurship is changing in this new era, \nand the implications for educators and for universities. The prevailing mode of \nentrepreneurship education has been dominated by an ideology of neo-liberal \nderegulated market economic growth, based largely on a North American set of \ncultural values which are increasingly questioned in view of the negative effects \nexperienced from the crisis, leading to a rethinking of the basis for enterprise \neducation in this new era.  \n \nThe article explores: \n1. The changing influences on entrepreneurship education and learning; \n2. What is the new era in entrepreneurship? The consequences of changing \nintellectual, economic, social and cultural movements for entrepreneurship \neducation and learning; \n3. How entrepreneurship education and learning can respond to the challenges \nof the new era. \nEntrepreneurship is a cultural movement, created and reproduced as a cultural \nideology through channels such as mass media, political rhetoric and government \npolicies, and education.  As such, entrepreneurship is responsive and adaptive to \nwider cultural movements, and its discourse reflects broader social concerns, such \nas ethical and environmental issues, and excessive rewards in the Banking sector.   \n \nFour broad forces are influencing the changing nature of entrepreneurship. These \nare, firstly, the economic and cultural context, in which economic challenges affect \nthe social and economic space for entrepreneurship, and movements towards \nresponsibility, ethics, and environmentalism demand recognition. Secondly, there are \nchanging expectations from learners, as their relationships with institutions change, \nin an era of graduate unemployment. Third, the nature of the learning and teaching \nrelationship is changing, including personalisation of learning, enterprising learning \nfrom school, applications of technology, assessment of practical applications through \nexperiential and work-based learning, reconceptualising the entrepreneurial \ncurriculum. Fourth, Universities face severe financial and staff resource constraints \nand pressure to change which affect the ways they work.  \n \nThis is leading to ongoing change in the nature of entrepreneurship education and \nlearning, both in the UK and at a European level. Meanwhile, the philosophy of \u2018old \nentrepreneurship\u2019, based primarily on inherited US-UK cultural influences and \ncapitalist economics, is increasingly in tension with the changing cultural and \neconomic dynamics of European culture and society, and a new conception of \nentrepreneurship is emerging. Just as Gibb (2002) set out the conflicting dualism \nbetween the bureaucratic and corporate with the enterprise cultures, so this \nprogression, described in the article as the move from \u2018Ent 1\u2019 to \u2018Ent 2\u2019 marks a shift \nin entrepreneurship thinking, with major implications for learning and education which \nare discussed in the article. \n \n \n 2\nThe new era \nThe end of 2008 conclusively ended an economic age of growth, prosperity, largely \nunregulated capitalism and a mutant form of entrepreneurship in the financial and \nother sectors, termed with due reference to Stevenson & Jarillo (1990), as \u2018the \npursuit of opportunities without regard to the consequences\u2019.  \n \nThe financial crisis, \u2018credit crunch\u2019 and ensuing world recession have been ably \ncharted by economic writers (Krugman, 2008; Cable 2010). However, the results are \nworth stating in outline. The closing months of 2008 saw the world banking and \nfinancial systems, especially those in the United States and United Kingdom, come \nclose to total collapse, avoided narrowly by massive governmental injection of \nfinance, which substantially increased public debt. The crisis in financial confidence \nsaw major banks close to failure, leading to a severe, lasting contraction in the \navailability of credit to individuals, businesses and, recently, governments.  \n \nWhilst banks have recovered their profitability, partly through servicing government \nborrowing, many other parts of society and the economy will continue to feel the \nafter-effects of the crisis for years to come.  There was a seminal moment in late \n2008 when the chiefs of the major US automotive companies travelled in their \nexecutive jets to Washington to plead for State assistance and prevent their collapse. \nThe subsequent administration of General Motors and Chrysler marked symbolically \nthe end of the United States twentieth century industrial corporation hegemony, a \nmodel which had dominated the commercial, economic, social and educational \n(notably Business School) structures of the Western economies.  \n \nThe crisis of 2008 is markedly different from the cyclical recessions of the early \n1980\u2019s and 1990\u2019s, which were followed by sustained economic growth. For whilst a \ngradual cyclical recovery is occurring, underlying economic fundamentals have \nchanged permanently in the US and UK. The relationships between banks, \ngovernment, businesses and consumers have changed, with a long term loss of \nconfidence in the banking and financial services industry. Public debt and its \nfinancing costs will remain at high levels for a long period. Western economies are in \nlong term economic decline in comparison with the growth economies of South East \nAsia. Public services, especially Higher Education, are experiencing significant \nreductions in State funding, and commitments such as guaranteed public pensions \nare increasingly unaffordable.  \n \nThis may seem a strange time to suggest that we are entering a new era of \nenterprise, but there are good reasons why this is so.  The ability of government to \nregenerate the economy is limited by political factors, such as the acceptability of \nhow much debt can be borne from future taxation, and the level of UK sterling and \nthe Euro. In 2010-11, 25% of the UK public spending on higher education is funded \nby debt. Governments can aim to create some of the macro-economic conditions for \nrecovery, but that is all, whilst corporate organisations are also reluctant to invest in \nmajor new projects except where the public sector is able to provide incentives or \nguarantees.  \n \nCulturally, old certainties have disappeared, replaced by uncertainty and a loss of \nconfidence in markets and institutions. This new era is marked by uncertainty in \nglobal, national and regional economies. The relevance for individuals is increasingly \nclear. Students and graduates who grew up in an era of growth experience a \nprofound culture shock on graduating to find high unemployment levels among both \ngraduates and young people in general, raising the possibility of inter-generational \nconflict (Willetts, 2010). There is an emerging crisis of graduate worklessness as EU \naverage unemployment in the 18-25 age group reaches an average of 19.8% \n 3\n(Eurostat 2009). The nature of graduate careers has changed, with the expectation of \nfinding graduate-level jobs being unrealistic for many. \n \nThis could be a discourse of decline, yet the new era poses a tremendous challenge \nfor entrepreneurs, politicians, educators and others, in which the role of enterprise is \nof fundamental importance. The challenge is how to regenerate economic activity, \nnew jobs and sources of wealth creation, especially for young people, without the \neasy certainties of either corporate or public investment; to which entrepreneurship, \nand learning to work in this new era, are vital contributors. \n \nResearch Approach \nThis research involved close engagement with entrepreneurship learning and \neducation during this period. The research stance is exploratory and reflective, the \nwriter acting as a speaker, educator, reviewer of refereed papers, engaged \nparticipant working with students, graduates, educators, entrepreneurs and business \nsupport professionals, and judging business awards. This research is experiential, \naction-based and reflective, informed by multiple discourses of entrepreneurship from \npolicy, education, media and practice. As a cultural movement, entrepreneurship is \nmanifested in such discourses, which make explicit significant governing ideas, \nconcepts, phrases, assumptions and values. Contributors to the discourse included \npolitical and government policy, close-to-government organisations such as NESTA \nand NCGE, academic research, and professional development meetings of \nenterprise educators. Direct engagement with learners and entrepreneurs at \neducational, networking events and other encounters has also contributed.   \n \nEntrepreneurial learning and education \nThis section summarises the foregoing literature in entrepreneurial learning and \neducation; socially responsible entrepreneurship; and entrepreneurship in the \nrecession. \n \nGibb (1996; 2002) provided intellectual and pedagogical foundations for the \ndevelopment of enterprise education, including the timely observation that \nentrepreneurs thrive in conditions of change and uncertainty (2002). These have \nbeen built on by others including Hannon (2004), Hytti and O\u2019Gorman (2004) and the \nWorld Economic Forum (2009). A recursive theme is the cultural divide in education \nbetween the \u2018bureaucratic \u2013 corporate and entrepreneurial\u2019 values (Gibb, 2002) \nmanifested in a polarisation between didactic and enterprising learning modes (Gibb, \n1993) which persists in education (Rae & Draycott, 2009).  \n  \nExtensive writing on enterprise education, including Garavan & O'Cinneide (1994), \nGorman, Hanlon & King (1997); Hannon, (2004); Pittaway & Cope, (2005) has shifted \ntowards experiential learning, learning \u2018for\u2019 rather than \u2018about\u2019 entrepreneurship, \nwithin which there is often a focus on the tangible and assessable outcome of a \nbusiness plan rather than the skills of entrepreneurship. Hannon (2005) proposed \nthat the educator could adopt different roles, using explicit philosophies of \nentrepreneurship education to achieve \u2018greater consistency, clarity and coherence of \npurpose, process and practice\u2019.  \n \nThe literature on entrepreneurial learning has made many connections with learning \nas active, connected with individual emergence, the development of identity and \npraxis, and deploying narratives as means of sensemaking, articulating and \ntheorising from learning (Deakins & Freel 1998; Rae, 2000, 2005; Cope & Watts, \n2000: Cope 2003, 2005 etc). Entrepreneurial learning can be defined as \u2018learning to \nrecognise and act on opportunities, and interacting socially to initiate, organise and \n 4\nmanage ventures\u2019 (Rae, 2005) and has the double connotation of both learning to \nbehave, as well as learning through, entrepreneurial ways.  \n \nA distinction may be made between enterprise education and enterprising (or \nentrepreneurial) learning. Education may seek to be learner-centred and to embrace \nnew pedagogical methods and technologies but is inevitably accountable to the need \nfor institutional control, order, accountability, and ultimately learning which is \nprogrammed by prescribed and measurable outcomes. Enterprising learning is by \ncontrast led by creativity, informality, curiosity, emotion and its application to personal \nand real-world problems and opportunities (Penaluna & Penaluna, 2008). Its values \nof practical and emergent learning challenge the \u2018bureaucratic control\u2019 culture of \nacademe which privileges programmed knowledge (Gibb, 2002). There is growing \nrecognition that learning for entrepreneurship in the context of higher education takes \nplace beyond the formal classroom environment, through experiential and discovery \nlearning which challenges orthodox pedagogies, with considerable experimentation \nin how this can be achieved.  \n \nSocial, ethical and responsible entrepreneurship \nThe rapidly developing literature on ethical, social and responsible entrepreneurship \nis highly relevant to the discussion of new entrepreneurship. Social enterprises are \ngenerally considered to be:  \n\u201cbusinesses with primarily social objectives whose surpluses \nare principally reinvested for that purpose in the business or community\u201d  \n(Office of the Third Sector) \n \nWhilst entrepreneurship might be considered as a value-free and amoral concept \n(Rae, 2007), and some entrepreneurial activities may be unproductive or destructive \nof value (Baumol, 1999), such considerations are increasingly challenged. Social \nentrepreneurship is a relatively young field and there are problematic issues, such as \ntensions between meeting social objectives and growth, and addressing the needs of \npolicymakers seeking to use social enterprise as a form of capacity-building to \nreplace public sector provision (Blundel & Spence, 2009). But it provides a frame of \nreference for \u2018responsible\u2019 entrepreneurship education and learning, based on the \nprinciple that entrepreneurial activity can create social good whilst reinvesting \nfinancial returns in community development.  \n \nLearning programmes for social entrepreneurship have developed separately from \n\u2018mainstream\u2019 entrepreneurship, with different antecedents (e.g. the School for Social \nEntrepreneurs). Frost (2009) illustrates examples of social enterprise projects \nemanating from University and student activities which demonstrate the creativity and \ngrowth in this field, for example in projects which have created employment in areas \nof social deprivation.  \n \nThe rapid development of social enterprise, and its appeal to young people, mean \nthat social enterprise should be considered as an integral aspect of entrepreneurship \neducation, altering the value-set of mainstream entrepreneurship; Chell (2007) \nargues for theoretical convergence between social and mainstream \nentrepreneurship. Ethical entrepreneurship is being popularised, whilst the \u2018insanity\u2019 \nof profit maximisation is even questioned on influential media (\u2019Newsnight\u2019, \n30.3.2010).  \n \nEntrepreneurship in the recession \nThe impact of the recession has featured in surprisingly little entrepreneurship \nacademic research, but presumably a wave of papers will appear in due course as \nresearchers need to engage with the serious issues facing entrepreneurs and \n 5\nbusinesses. Anderson & Russell (2009:11) concluded from a survey of small UK \nbusinesses that many exhibited resilience, flexibility, adaptability and absorptive \ncapacity underpinned by personal sacrifices of the owners: \u2018survival, almost \nregardless of personal cost, is instinctive\u2019. This reinforces Gibb\u2019s view that \npersistence and adaptive learning characterise many owners of small businesses.  \nThe writer has contributed to the subject, on the possible effects of the recession on \ngraduate employability and HEIs (Rae, 2008); the role of entrepreneurship in causing \nthe recession and enabling recovery (Rae, 2009\u00b9); and on the question of creating \njobs in the new era (Rae, 2009\u00b2). \n \nThere is also research on entrepreneurship and small business from previous \nrecessions. Storey (1994) assessed the contribution of enterprise start-up \nprogrammes in the early 1980\u2019s, noting the displacement effects. It can be predicted \nfrom past research that start-up rates will increase during a recession, owing to \nredundancy, necessity entrepreneurship, and freeing-up of human capital and other \nresources from organisations which are downsizing. Also, business closures tend to \npeak at the end of a recession and in the early stages of recovery, as firms which \nhave \u2018hung on\u2019 run out of the financial resources to adapt to a changing economy.  \n \n Cultural change and the crisis of entrepreneurship  \nEntrepreneurship enjoys privileged status under neo-liberal economic management, \nespecially in the US and UK.  Capitalist economic growth theory has dominated the \nprincipal theories of entrepreneurship and the related field of business growth (Low \nand Macmillan, 1988). The concepts of resource-based theory (Penrose, 1959; \nGarnsey, 1998), of opportunity recognition (Kirzner, 1973; Stevenson and Jarillo, \n1990), the creation of new economic activity (Low and Macmillan, 1988), necessity \nand opportunity entrepreneurship (Reynolds et al, 2002), and predictive models of \nbusiness growth (Greiner, 1972; Churchill and Lewis, 1983) are all based on the \neconomic theories of Schumpeter, Kirzner, and Hayek (Hebert & Link, 1988) of which \nthe entrepreneur is the \u2018action man\u2019 (sic). \n \nGiven the crisis in the capitalist economic system which emerged from the \u2018credit \ncrunch\u2019 and near-collapse of the banking system in late 2008, there is a  \nquestionable basis for the reliance of entrepreneurship theory on such economics. \nConcepts such as \u2018creative destruction\u2019 (Schumpeter, 1934) and the \u2018pursuit of \nopportunity regardless of the resources controlled\u2019 (Stevenson & Jarillo, 1990: 23) \nare now distinctly double-edged and pose ethical problems. How is such \nentrepreneurship useful and responsible to society? Can society afford to give such \nentrepreneurs free rein to create wealth with incidental benefits to others in times of \ngrowth, whilst wreaking havoc with the financial system and causing tremendous \ndamage in which the state has no option but to step in and clear up the mess at \nmassive cost? \n \nThe overwhelming economic drive in important parts of the US and UK economies in \nthe boom years up to 2007 became the pursuit of short-term profit opportunities, in \nwhich resources were borrowed on easy credit, the stewardship of those resources \nwas largely neglected, and there was weak regulation. This liberated a mutant form \nof entrepreneurship which became \u2018the pursuit of opportunity regardless of the \nconsequences\u2019 especially in the financial and property sectors of the US and UK, as \nunproductive and destructive entrepreneurship (Baumol, 1999), and in the \nprevalence of private equity acquisitions of major companies which left them with \nhigh burdens of debt. \n \nA distinction must be made between such misplaced entrepreneurship in the \nrelatively limited environs of banking and financial services in the US and UK, and \n 6\nproductive entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurs are not in general irresponsible, and \nmany businesses suffered from the actions of a relatively small but powerful minority. \nBut business culture is affected, requiring educationalists to reconsider the role and \nnature of entrepreneurship in this new era and their approach to teaching it. \n \nWe need to examine the nature of entrepreneurship and its utility in the new era. \n\u2018Old\u2019 entrepreneurship,  based on capitalist growth theory produced  a dominant \nhegemonic model, based on US economic interests, akin to having a \u2018bison in the \nliving room\u2019, unaware of the destructive effects it can unwittingly cause on the \nenvironment around it. Its existence is founded on the following assumptions. \n\u2022 It is inherently selfish, based on the notion of individual enterprise and self-\nenrichment through the investment of personal effort in conditions of uncertainty. \n\u2022 It assumes and makes decisions on dynamics of investment, risk and return \nwithin the paradigm of capitalist economic growth. \n\u2022 It is subject to irrational market behavioural herd instincts of greed and fear;  the \nemblem of former bank Merrill Lynch was \u2018the thundering herd\u2019.  \n\u2022 Its goal is continuous and competitive growth in scale, turnover, sales and \nprofitability. \n\u2022 It operates on an inherently wasteful resource-consumption model of \u2018capture \nand exploit\u2019, with waste or sub-optimal use of natural, physical, human and other \nresources being of little concern. \n\u2022 It takes no moral responsibility for the consequences of its actions on the wider \necology of the world economy, societies, resources and environment. \n\u2022 It uses government protection to provide international business advantage rather \nthan equity, using legal, trading and environmental agreements to protect its \ninterests. \n\u2022 It assumes competition to achieve market domination is inherently good, except \nby foreign entrants to its own markets. \n\u2022 It is destructive of value as well as creative. \n\u2022 It became centred excessively on the pursuit of short-term profitability above all \nelse. \n \nThe late Peter Drucker (1993) long ago argued the need for the US economy to \nmove on from this  \u2018old\u2019 form of entrepreneurship which has been, and may continue \nto be, highly successful in its own terms but the financial crisis raises important \nquestions about the relationship between the entrepreneur and society. Currently, \nentrepreneurs are free within the market economy to create and exploit opportunities \nby finding and allocating resources, taking the rewards from successful risks and the \npenalty from unsuccessful ones, and sharing these with investors. Society accepts \nthe by-products of entrepreneurial activity through the benefits of wealth creation, tax \nrevenue, the provision of services and products which meet market needs and solve \nproblems viably, and provide employment.   \n \nThis free-market approach has been accepted because it delivered outcomes of \neconomic growth, prosperity and employment. But the relationship between \nentrepreneurs and society now requires re-examination. Entrepreneurs are free to \npursue any opportunities within legal boundaries, some of which are of greater value \nto society than others. Productive entrepreneurship creates social value and new \nopportunities. Free market doctrine maintains that \u2018the market\u2019 decides, yet few \nmarkets are as free as they appear. Society provides market opportunities, resources \nand support for entrepreneurs, who in turn have responsibilities towards society.  The \nrelationship, or \u2018contract\u2019, between entrepreneur and society might be revised to \naddress these responsibilities: \n 7\n\u0083 solving problems and providing services of wider social value, such as \neducation, community, health, nutrition and housing, as well as being \nprofitable;  \n\u0083 acting responsibly towards investors and those who provide resources;  \n\u0083 practising environmental sustainability and ethical behaviour towards \nemployees within the business and communities, customers and suppliers;  \n\u0083 recognising that as well as individual, there are mutual interests shared by \nthe community in both the success and possible failure of the venture; \n\u0083 responsible entrepreneurship should be rewarded financially and socially. \n \nThis provides a \u2018bounded\u2019 perspective in which entrepreneurship produces social \ngood and works responsibly within a framework of business ethics, environmentally \nsustainable practices, and stewardship of resources, forming a basis for \u2018responsible\u2019 \nentrepreneurship education. It may be argued that this is an unreasonable imposition \non free enterprise, yet increasing numbers of enterprises and people act in these \nways as normal everyday practice, and find that they make good business sense. \nEntrepreneurs are quite capable of learning and changing in their own self-interest; \nentrepreneurship is an adaptive cultural phenomenon, and there is evidence of \nmovement towards new forms of entrepreneurship. Schumacher\u2019s (1974) philosophy \nof smallness, sustainability and ecology remains valid today.  \n \nSo the entrepreneurial model must evolve beyond the economic goal of short-term \nprofit maximisation, going beyond business capitalism to contribute to the wider \nneeds of societies which provide resources and market opportunities. A new \nparadigm for entrepreneurship in the new era should reflect a responsible approach \nto enterprise education.  Table 1 summarises characteristics of the \u2018old \nentrepreneurship\u2019 as \u2018Ent 1\u2019 and compares these with the emerging paradigm  of \u2018Ent \n2\u2019, the \u2018new entrepreneurship\u2019. \n \n\u2018Ent 1\u2019 old entrepreneurship \u2018Ent 2\u2019 new entrepreneurship \n\u2022 Individual-team leadership within a \nsocial context \n\u2022 Individualism \n\u2022 Neoliberal capitalism \n\u2022 Opportunities create multiple forms of \nvalue: financial, creative, social, \necological \n\u2022 Opportunity pursuit regardless of \nresources, ethics or consequences \n\u2022 Business driven: short term financial \nprofitability, growth & sell-out \u2022 Socially connected and networked   \n\u2022 Collectivist and inclusive \u2022 Value creation measured only in \nfinancial terms of profit maximisation \u2022 Ethically responsible \n\u2022 Economically and environmentally \nsustainable \n\u2022 Exploitative & wasteful of resources \n\u2022 Exclusive role models of \u2018the \nentrepreneur\u2019 \u2022 Sensitive to resource stewardship, \nconservation and re-use \u2022 Founded on masculine attributes of \naggression, power, conflict \u2022 Longer term sustainable growth and \ndevelopment \u2022 Fuelled by debt \n\u2022 Feminine values: relational, \ncollaborative, intuitive working which \ncomplement  \n\u2022 Masculine attributes of competition \n\u2022 Grassroots enterprise and resourcing \n \nTable 1: characteristics of old and new entrepreneurship \n \nWithin Universities, there are growing numbers of entrepreneurs who see their \nvalues, practices and identity reflected more closely by \u2018Ent 2\u2019 than \u2018Ent 1\u2019.  There is \na long tradition of entrepreneurial responsibility, philanthropy and \u2018giving back\u2019, more \n 8\nprevalent in the US than the UK, but there is a need to go beyond voluntarism, and to \nembed responsibility at the core of entrepreneurship.  \n \nSome entrepreneurs will always behave according to the \u2018Ent 1\u2019 model, but this \nrequires critical questioning, and educators have a responsibility for raising learners\u2019 \nunderstanding of its limitations, because there does not need to be a trade-off \nbetween ethical responsibility and long-term business success.  Businesses can \npractice responsible values whilst being entrepreneurial and successful. \n \nEducation is an important formative medium for influencing entrepreneurial culture \nand behaviours. The choices educators make when explaining enterprise have \nconsequences, since popular messages, media stereotypes and summarised \ndefinitions of enterprise often perpetuate \u2018old entrepreneurship\u2019, whilst government \nagencies see the \u2018delivery\u2019 of an enterprise culture and the promulgation of a \nsimplified ideology of enterprise to students as being the legitimate task of education. \nA critical academic stance on entrepreneurship education is needed to moderate \nsuch messages on the role and nature of entrepreneurship, which has the potential \nto create social good, as well as the destructive power to cause damage; a balanced \napproach to education should illustrate both sides of this argument.  \n \nIt is perhaps a missed opportunity when education seeks to reproduce, without \ncritique, popular media stereotypes of entrepreneurship, such as \u2018Dragons\u2019 Den\u2019 and \n\u2018The Apprentice\u2019, because they have popular resonance with students, when they \noffer very narrow, simplistic and unrepresentative depictions of entrepreneurship \nwithin popular media. They make ratings-attractive television, but they represent a \nkind of entrepreneurial pornography, a form of literature which schools would not use \nwithin sex education.  \n \n \nThe economic and social context \nThis section considers the influence and implications of four major factors in shaping \nentrepreneurship education and learning within the cultural and educational context \nof the new era.  \n \nThe economic crisis has reinforced the decline in European economic performance, \ngrowth and competitiveness in relation to the emerging economies of China, India \nand other South Asian states.  Whilst the Lisbon accord (EC, 2000) aspired to \ntransform the EU into \u2018the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy \nin the world\u2019 through entrepreneurship, it is now clear that this is little more than a \nmirage. Whilst some industries, corporations and countries perform well, there is a \nvery long tail of uncompetitive firms, public debt and underemployed knowledge-\nworkers such as graduates.  \n \nBritain and the EU are experiencing unemployment rates in the 18-25 age group of \nalmost 20% (Eurostat, 2009). This results from the recession and from a long-term \nfailure to create sufficient new jobs in society for young people, against increasing \nrates and lengths of economic activity by older workers, and mismatches between \neducational \u2018production\u2019 (often described as skills) and employer demand. \nWorklessness in this age group is both structural as cyclical, and whilst severe \nacross the UK, it is exceptionally serious in post-industrial regions. Employers such \nas retail, service sector, call centres and increasingly public organisations no longer \nprovide the employment opportunities of the \u2018boom years\u2019, whilst public spending \nconstraints are significantly reducing Higher and Further Education places.  \n \n 9\nBlanchflower (2009) suggested that a \u2018lost generation\u2019 risks being blighted by \nstructural unemployment. Governmental response in 2009-10 resurrected an \nindustrial strategy in the shape of the \u2018New Industry, New Jobs\u2019 agenda (BIS, 2009), \neither as a political face-saver, or a belated but long-term strategy. Its overall \nconclusion, that  future jobs will be created in four main groups of economic activity, \nis supported by Brinkley (2010: 25).  \n \nHowever, it is increasingly the case that many young entrants to the job market find it \ndifficult to achieve socialisation into work, and experience fragmented, low-income \njobs, training places and worklessness. Others realise that, given the difficult jobs \nmarket, creating their own job by starting a business is a preferred option which can \nprovide independence, self-fulfilment and income. \n \nLearners  \nLearners\u2019 expectations are changing in their relationship institutions. A \nEurobarometer survey of HE students across the EU in 2009 showed most agreed \nthat study programmes should include generic competencies such as communication \nskills, teamwork, and \u201clearning to learn\u201d; and should provide the knowledge and \ncompetences needed for employability in the labour market, and to enhance personal \ndevelopment. Most agreed it was important for higher education institutions to foster \ninnovation and an entrepreneurial mindset among students and staff, and that work \nplacements in private enterprises should be offered within study programmes (EC, \n2009; 2-4). \n \nGiven the social and economic context, it is not surprising students should see these \naspects of learning to be required, especially where, as in the UK, study is \naccompanied by debt. The economic and demographic challenges facing European \nsocieties include ageing populations and a need to extend economically active \nworking lives, the shrinkage of traditional and public sector employment, and the \nneed to create new jobs. These demonstrate that wider participation in \nentrepreneurship education during higher or continuing education is required. \nWomen are increasingly represented in graduate and managerial roles, requiring \nhigher levels of entrepreneurial skills. Entrepreneurship education must also be \nextended to multicultural and multi-ethnic populations to widen their opportunities for \neconomic participation and progression. The alternative will be social tensions arising \nfrom exclusion from economic and employment opportunities. This argues for an \ninclusive, lifelong approach to enterprise learning which is consistent with the \u2018new \nentrepreneurship\u2019 concept. \n \nLearning and teaching \nTrends in enterprise education are moving away from a concentration on business \nand management and towards an intersubjectival relevance to a wider range of study \nprogrammes, including science and technology, creative and humanities, although \nmore needs to be done in this regard (Wilson 2008). \n \nThere are increasing possibilities for changing the nature of the learning relationship, \nincluding personalisation of learning, and using technology applications and \nsimulations which enable new forms and modes of learning. It is also recognised that \nconventional forms of assessment, such as essays and business plan submissions, \nare not optimal in assessing and validating enterprise capabilities, and moves \ntowards assessment of the practical applications of enterprise learning, such as \nthrough creative, experiential and work-based learning, are required, leading to a \nreconceptualisation of the entrepreneurial curriculum (Penaluna & Penaluna, 2008). \nIncreasingly, knowing and doing need to be integrated, connecting theory and \npractice through active learning; learning needs to be enabled by effective uses of \n 10\ntechnology; and learners need to be able to operate in unpredictable social and \neconomic conditions. \n \nInstitutions \nStrong movements are forcing learning institutions to change. Universities, colleges \nand public authorities are subject to increasing regulation, funding and market \npressures, with constrained financial and staff resources accelerating change, \ncompetition and multiple expectations. The concept of the \u2018entrepreneurial university\u2019 \nis one means of achieving institutional transformation, but may not be compatible \nwith increasing regulation and control by government.  It is likely that significant \nreductions in public funding will reshape HE provision in England, through a \ncombination of mergers, acquisitions, collaborations and even closures of institutions \nbetween 2010 and 2015. The culture of Higher Education and the experiences of \nworking and studying are certain to change significantly, especially given the change \nin UK government in May 2010. \n \nThe \u2018entrepreneurial university\u2019 may be less a solution than a process of institutional \nchange in which conflicts and tensions of mission, power and priority have to be \naddressed and resolved (Rae et al, 2009). In the UK, a range of possible new models \nfor the 21st century have been proposed, recognising the changing new economics of \nHigher Education; marketisation, reduced dependence on public finding, \ndifferentiation in missions and types of institution will create change within the HE \nsector. (PA Consulting, 2009; Brown, 2009). \n \nGreat pressure is be on Universities to reduce dependence on State funding through \ndiversifying activities and stimulating innovation and knowledge exploitation. \nCollaboration through entrepreneurial knowledge networks with regional and \nbusiness organisations, entrepreneurs and others is increasingly required. Hence \nentrepreneurship must be practiced as effectively as it is taught by universities. \n \nImplications for entrepreneurial education and learning \nThese cultural, economic and political factors pose significant challenges for the \ndevelopment of entrepreneurship education in the new era. Figure 2 illustrates how \nentrepreneurial education - learning which is entrepreneurial in process as well as \nsubject - consists of dynamic learning relationships which are active, social and \nconnected, influenced by economic and market-driven changes as well as by \ngovernment, environmentalism, technology and changing learners\u2019 expectations. \nThese influences affect the outcomes and applications of learning; the purpose of \nlearning; the content and process of learning; and the role of educators.  \n \nOne consequence is to change the power balance between learners, institutions and \neducators. Rather than educators designing a curriculum which is institutionally \nsanctioned and taught to learners, entrepreneurial education increasingly enables the \nlearner to direct their learning and design a personalised learning experience.  \nAssessment is one arena in which there is a renegotiation away from conventional \nacademic outcomes, or proxies for business validity such as the \u2018business plan\u2019, \ntowards learning outcomes which are current and valid for the learner (Penaluna & \nPenaluna 2008). Such changes can have liberating and emancipatory effects for \nlearners but also bring responsibilities and consequences. One characteristic of the \nchanging nature of the higher education experience is a trend towards \u2018student as \nconsumer\u2019. Active and engaged consumerism is much more likely to lead to this \napproach working for the learner, which passive \u2018spoonfeeding\u2019 will not.  \n \n 11\nEntrepreneurial education in the new era\nDynamic learning relationships\n(active, social, connected)\nGlobal economic change\nLearner expectations:\nPersonal, social, active\nVolatile markets\nGov\u2019t policy\nChanging technology\nCultural change\nEthics\nConstrained\nresources\nFORMATIVE INFLUENCES CHANGING THEORIES\nOutcomes: \nAssessing & \napplying learning\nPurpose:\neducation\neconomic\nideology\nContent: \nWhat is learned \nExperience: how\nlearning occurs\nEducators\nrole\nGreen thinking & \nenvironmental change\n \nFigure 2: Dynamic learning relationships affecting entrepreneurial education \n \n   \nConclusion: responding to the challenges of the new era \n \nEntrepreneurship education is at the cusp of the new era. On one hand, the \ncontribution of entrepreneurship learning to the economic regeneration of a post-\nrecessionary society and the creation of new enterprises and jobs is vital. On the \nother, Universities are affected by reduced State funding which constrains their ability \nto meet demand from students, social enterprises and small businesses. The Labour \ngovernment in the UK funded enterprise education generously in the period up to \n2010 and the change of government in May 2010 is certain to alter funding priorities. \nFunding issues may well threaten the employment of enterprise educators and \nresearchers. As we are in a period of opportunity but uncertainty, familiar territory for \nentrepreneurs, the best way forward is for educators to act as entrepreneurs. \n \nEnterprise educators are likely to face the challenges of meeting increasing demand, \nfrom a wider range of subject areas, from people with more varied subject \nbackgrounds and prior learning who increasingly have not studied business, with \ndiverse aims, and at a different life stages. Limited resources will be available to \nrespond to this demand, hence being able to generate private-sector and third-sector \nresources will be increasingly vital. Making clear what is on offer, its  relevance and \nvalue, and contextualising and adapting this for different client groups is essential. \nReductions in government funding for business support services may create new \nopportunities for universities to provide higher value-added, paid-for services.  \n \nEducators and researchers face the associated challenge and opportunity of turning \ntheir intellectual capital of knowledge and research into financial value, using the \nsocial capital of their academic, professional, business and public policy networks in \nways which help to achieve this. Although this article has criticised over-reliance on \nUS models, much can be learned from the ways on which North American \nuniversities have built long-standing and mutually valued relationships with \nentrepreneurial and business networks.  \n 12\n \nThe changing nature of entrepreneurship is both a challenge and opportunity for \neducators. The discourse on the nature of entrepreneurship in society is changing \nand needs to move beyond perpetuating media stereotypes. The movement from \n\u2018Ent 1\u2019 defined by free-market economics towards responsible entrepreneurship \nreflects the changing cultural context and its interactions between society and \nentrepreneurship. The shift towards socially responsible entrepreneurship, \naccountable to society, reflects ethically and environmentally sustainable values. This \nmovement suggests that the changing nature of entrepreneurship is an outcome of a \nprocess of learning and adaptation. Educators have a major, but not exclusive role to \nplay in defining and informing the new entrepreneurship through research, innovative \nlearning and co-creation of knowledge with new era entrepreneurs. There are vital \nquestions about what the new entrepreneurship means in different contexts, how \npeople learn, innovate and develop new era enterprises, and what new business \nmodels they develop to create value. There is increasing convergence between \n\u2018mainstream\u2019 entrepreneurship as it moves towards the new era paradigm and social \nentrepreneurship, which has informed and created new insights into the potential for \nresponsible entrepreneurship.  \n \nIn conclusion, education is vital in creating understanding of entrepreneurship, \ndeveloping entrepreneurial capabilities, and contributing to entrepreneurial identities \nand cultures at individual, collective and social levels. The role of education is to \nshape ideas of what it means to be an entrepreneur, not to promote an ideology of \nentrepreneurship, and to create critical awareness which contributes to the \naccountability of entrepreneurs to society. Education has a moral as well as practical \npurpose in this project and the nervousness of educators in being required to \npromote an entrepreneurial ideology is entirely understandable. But the ways in \nwhich people are learning about and to practice entrepreneurship as we move into \nthe new era are shaping the opportunities, business models, and organisational \ncultures they develop, reflecting the changing social context. The learning \nenvironment for the new era is socially engaged and responsive, collective and \ninclusive as well as individualistic, appreciative of both feminine and masculine ways \nof working, ethical and sustainable \u2013 yet still recognisably entrepreneurial. \nEntrepreneurship is a dynamic concept which transforms and reshapes the world \naround it, meaning that the ideas developed in this paper are merely milestones in \nthis transformation, and will become part of its history as they are superseded. \n \n \nReferences \n \nAnderson, A.
