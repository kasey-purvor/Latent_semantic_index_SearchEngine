LAHIRI1 AND KANCHAN MUKHERJEE\nUniversity of Maryland, College Park and University of Liverpool\nWe obtain a limit of a hierarchical Bayes estimator of a finite popula-\ntion mean when the sample size is large. The limit is in the sense of ordinary\ncalculus, where the sample observations are treated as fixed quantities. Our\nresult suggests a simple way to correct the hierarchical Bayes estimator to\nachieve design-consistency, a well-known property in the traditional random-\nization approach to finite population sampling. We also suggest three different\nmeasures of uncertainty of our proposed estimator.\n1. Introduction. Ericson [4] put forward a subjective Bayesian approach in\nfinite population sampling. The subjective Bayes and the more general hierarchical\nBayes estimators have been found to be effective in combining information from a\nvariety of sources in conjunction with the sample survey data on the main variable\nof interest; see [10]. Specific applications include small area estimation, estimation\nfrom longitudinal surveys, and so on.\nIn Section 2, we obtain the mathematical limit of a general version of Eric-\nson\u2019s subjective Bayes estimator of a finite population mean when the sample size\nis large. By mathematical limit, we mean the limit in the sense of ordinary cal-\nculus, where observations are treated as fixed real numbers. We show that the\nBayes estimator converges to a quantity which is free of any hyperparameters,\nbut may depend on the sample observations, irrespective of the model used to de-\nrive the Bayes estimator. This pure mathematical result can be used to examine the\ndesign-consistency property of the subjective Bayes estimator. Design-consistency\nis a desirable property in the randomization approach to finite population sam-\npling. Kott [13] advocated the use of a model-based estimator of a finite popu-\nlation mean which is also design-consistent. For a formal definition of design-\nconsistency, see [22], page 18. We find that the subjective Bayes estimator is, in\ngeneral, not design-consistent. In other words, the subjective Bayes estimator does\nnot converge to the true finite population mean as the sample size becomes large.\nHere the convergence is defined with respect to the sampling design, observations\nReceived March 2003; revised May 2006.\n1Supported in part by a grant from the Center of Excellence in Health Statistics of the University\nof Michigan, Ann Arbor, and the Gallup Organization.\nAMS 2000 subject classifications.

Model-based estimation\n(both empirical and hierarchical Bayes) of a stratum mean has been considered by\nseveral authors; see Ghosh and Meeden [9], Ghosh and Lahiri [6], Battese, Harter\nand Fuller [2], Datta and Ghosh [3], Prasad and Rao [19], Ghosh and Lahiri [8],\nArora, Lahiri and Mukherjee [1] and Jiang, Lahiri and Wan [12], among others.\nPrasad and Rao [20] observed that these model-based estimators are typically not\ndesign-consistent unless the sampling design is self-weighting within each stra-\ntum, and they proposed a pseudo-EBLUP design-consistent estimator for the nor-\nmal case; see [23] for a pseudo-hierarchical Bayes version of Prasad and Rao [20].\nHowever, it is not clear how one can extend their approach to a general nonnormal\ncase, since the distribution of a linear combination of observations used in their\npaper is not always analytically tractable for nonnormal cases. In Section 3 we\nprovide the stratified sampling extension of the result of Section 2 for a general\nhierarchical Bayes estimator of the finite population mean when the hyperparame-\nters are assumed to be unknown. Again, our mathematical limit result lends itself\nto a simple correction of the hierarchical Bayes estimator to achieve the design-\nconsistency property.\nFor small area problems with binary data, Folsom, Shah and Vaish [5] proposed\na method which appears to work well in their simulation work in terms of design-\nconsistency. However, a formal proof is needed to claim design-consistency of\ntheir estimator. In this connection, we also mention the work of Malec, Davis and\nCao [16], who considered sample selection adjustment to their model-based proce-\ndure. See [21] and [11] for further discussions of design-consistency in small area\nestimation. The simple and general approach taken in this paper merely involves\nfinding the mathematical limit of a hierarchical Bayes estimator.\nMeasuring uncertainty of the proposed design-consistent model-based estimator\nis an important problem. In Section 4 we first present two possible ways to measure\nthe uncertainty of the proposed design-consistent model-based estimator. We note\ntheir merits and disadvantages and propose a third measure that is just a simple\naverage of the two. The results from a simulation study are presented in Section 5.\nIn our simulation experiment the proposed measures perform reasonably well and\nthe third measure appears to be a compromise between the first two. The technical\nderivations of the results of Sections 2 and 3 are relegated to the Appendix.\n2. The Bayes estimator and its limiting behavior. Let Yi be the value of\nthe characteristic of interest for the ith unit of a finite population (i = 1, . . . ,N ).\nWe assume that the finite population size N is known. In our subjective Bayesian\nformulation, we assume that Yi , i = 1, . . . ,N, are independent realizations from a\n726 P. LAHIRI AND K. MUKHERJEE\nsuperpopulation belonging to the family of densities\nf (y|\u03b8,\u03c6) = exp[\u03c6\u22121{y\u03b8 \u2212 \u03c8(\u03b8)} + \u03c1(y,\u03c6)],(2.1)\nwhere \u03c6 > 0. When \u03c6 is known, the generalized linear models characterized by the\nabove class of densities include the exponential family of distributions (in partic-\nular, Gaussian, Bernoulli and Poisson distributions). Thus, it includes continuous\ndata as well as both the categorical and count data. When \u03c6 is unknown, it includes\ndistributions which are not in the exponential family. Note that the function \u03c8 is\ngiven by\n\u03c8(\u03b8) = \u03c6 log\n\u222b\nexp[\u03c6\u22121y\u03b8 + \u03c1(y,\u03c6)]dy\nand the mean of Y is \u03c8 \u2032(\u03b8); see [18], page 28. Here and throughout the paper,\n\u03b1\u2032 denotes the derivative of an arbitrary function \u03b1.\nWe assume that the superpopulation parameter \u03b8 has the prior distribution\nh(\u03b8) = \u03b2 + u,(2.2)\nwhere h, called the link function, is a strictly increasing function of \u03b8 , \u03b2 \u2208 R is\na location parameter and u \u223c N(0, r\u22121). Similar Bayesian models were used by\nGhosh and Meeden ([10], page 269).\nA sample of fixed size n is drawn from the finite population. Let {p(s)} de-\nnote the sampling design. Note that p(s) is the probability of drawing a particular\nsample s of size n from the universe of all possible samples S of size n. Thus,\np(s) \u2265 0 for all s \u2208 S and \u2211s\u2208S p(s) = 1. Let \u03c0i = P(s \u0005 i) be the first-order in-\nclusion probability of unit i, that is, the probability of including the population unit\ni in the sample (i = 1, . . . ,N). Let ys = (Yi, i \u2208 s) be the vector of observations\nin the sample.\nThe standard Bayesian approach to finite population sampling recognizes the\nimportance of a good sampling design for selecting the sample, but once the sam-\nple is selected, the approach does not use the inclusion probabilities in the estima-\ntion. Under the Bayesian model (2.1) and (2.2) and squared error loss, the Bayes\nestimator of the finite population mean, \u0006Y =\u2211Ni=1 Yi\/N, is given by\n\u0006\u0302YB = E[\u0006Y |ys] = fny\u00afs + (1 \u2212 fn)E[\u03c8 \u2032(\u03b8)|ys],(2.3)\nwhere fn = n\/N and y\u00afs = n\u22121\u2211i\u2208s Yi is the sample mean.\nIn order to understand the relationship between the Bayes estimator \u0006\u0302YB and y\u00afs\nfor a large sample, we find the mathematical limit of E[\u03c8 \u2032(\u03b8)|ys] as n \u2192 \u221e as a\nfunction of y\u00afs . Hence, in the following y\u00afs is treated as a nonrandom argument of\nE[\u03c8 \u2032(\u03b8)|ys]. Consequently, let Tn be a random variable with density (as a function\nof t)\nexp[\u2212n\u03c6\u22121\u03c8(t)] exp[\u03c6\u22121ny\u00afst]\n\/\u222b\nexp[\u2212n\u03c6\u22121\u03c8(\u03c4)] exp[\u03c6\u22121ny\u00afs\u03c4 ]d\u03c4.(2.4)\nThis leads to the following lemma.\nDESIGN-CONSISTENCY OF HB ESTIMATORS 727\nLEMMA 2.1. In addition to (2.1) and (2.2), assume the following regularity\nconditions:\n(R.1) The functions \u03c8 \u2032(\u00b7) exp[\u2212(r\/2){h(\u00b7) \u2212 \u03b2}2]h\u2032(\u00b7) and exp[\u2212(r\/2){h(\u00b7) \u2212\n\u03b2}2]h\u2032(\u00b7) are bounded.\n(R.2) The sequence of random variables {Tn} converges in probability with re-\nspect to (2.4) to T as n \u2192 \u221e.\nThen E[\u03c8 \u2032(\u03b8)|ys] converges to C := \u03c8 \u2032(T ).\nREMARK 2.1. In general, T is a function of y\u00afs . This reveals the large-sample\nbehavior of E[\u03c8 \u2032(\u03b8)|ys] as a function of y\u00afs . In the Appendix, we verify that as-\nsumptions (R.1) and (R.2) are satisfied for three well-known distributions involv-\ning Gaussian, Bernoulli and Poisson distributions, where C = y\u00afs .\nThe following theorem is a simple consequence of Lemma 2.1 and (2.3).\nTHEOREM 2.1. In addition to the conditions of Lemma 2.1, suppose that\nfn \u2192 f for some 0 < f < 1. Then\n\u0006\u0302YB \u2192 f y\u00afs + (1 \u2212 f )C\nas n \u2192 \u221e.\nIn the Appendix, we note that the convergence proof of Theorem 2.1 does not\nuse any assumptions regarding the sampling design. In general, for large n, \u0006\u0302YB is\nnot design-consistent, except possibly for a self-weighting sampling design. Let\ny\u00afw be any design-consistent estimator of \u0006Y . For example, we can choose y\u00afw to\nbe the well-known Hansen\u2013Hurwitz or Horvitz\u2013Thompson estimator. Then, using\nTheorem 2.1, we can obtain the following design-consistent estimator of \u0006Y based\non the Bayes estimator:\n\u0006\u0302Y = \u0006\u0302YB \u2212 {f y\u00afs + (1 \u2212 f )C \u2212 y\u00afw}.\nFor a self-weighing design, y\u00afw = y\u00afs , and so the Bayes estimator is indeed design-\nconsistent for the three examples given in the Appendix.\n3. Hierarchical Bayes estimator and its limiting behavior. In this section\nwe extend the results of Section 2 and consider two important cases: case (i) \u03c6 is\nknown, but \u03b2 and r are unknown, and case (ii) all of the hyperparameters are\nunknown. To treat these two cases, we need further information on the finite pop-\nulation that allows estimation of unknown hyperparameters through an appropri-\nate hierarchical Bayes method. To this end, consider a finite population divided\ninto m strata. Let Yij denote the value of the j th observation in the ith stratum\n(i = 1, . . . ,m; j = 1, . . . ,Ni). We consider the estimation of a particular stratum\n728 P. LAHIRI AND K. MUKHERJEE\nmean. Without loss of generality, we consider estimation of the mth stratum mean\ngiven by \u0006Ym = N\u22121m\n\u2211Nm\nj=1 Ymj , where Nm is the known population size for the\nmth stratum. We assume that the sample ys consists of ni observations from the\nith stratum, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m.\nIn addition to (2.1) and (2.2), for each Yij (i = 1, . . . ,m; j = 1, . . . ,Ni), we\nassume that \u03b2 and r are independent, with \u03b2 \u223c U(\u2212\u221e,\u221e), an improper uniform\ndistribution over the real line, and r \u223c G(a,b), a gamma distribution with density\nproportional to r(b\/2)\u22121 exp[\u2212(a\/2)r].\nWriting \u03b8 = [\u03b81, . . . , \u03b8m]\u2032, we obtain the conditional density\n\u03c0(\u03b8 ,\u03b2, r, \u03c6|ys) \u221d\nm\u220f\ni=1\nni\u220f\nj=1\nexp[\u03c6\u22121{yij \u03b8i \u2212 \u03c8(\u03b8i)} + \u03c1(yij , \u03c6)]\n\u00d7\nm\u220f\ni=1\n{\nexp[\u2212(r\/2){h(\u03b8i) \u2212 \u03b2}2]h\u2032(\u03b8i)r1\/2}(3.1)\n\u00d7 exp[\u2212ar\/2]r(b\/2)\u22121.\nFirst, consider case (i). In this case, we show that (see the Appendix)\nE[\u03c8 \u2032(\u03b8m)|ys]\n(3.2)\n= ETnm [\u03c8 \u2032(Tnm)h\u2032(Tnm)g(Tnm)]\/ETnm [h\u2032(Tnm)g(Tnm)],\nwhere the expectation in (3.2) is taken with respect to a random variable Tnm with\ndensity (as a function of t)\nexp[\u03c6\u22121nm{y\u00afmt \u2212 \u03c8(t)}]\n\/\u222b\nexp[\u03c6\u22121nm{y\u00afm\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c8(\u03c4)}]d\u03c4,(3.3)\nand where g is a function defined in (A.7).\nThis leads to the following lemma, which, in turn, proves the convergence of\nthe hierarchical Bayes estimator to y\u00afm.\nLEMMA 3.1. Assume the following regularity conditions.\n(R.3) The functions \u03c8 \u2032(\u00b7)h\u2032(\u00b7)g(\u00b7) and h\u2032(\u00b7)g(\u00b7) are bounded.\n(R.4) The sequence of random variables {Tnm} converges in probability [with\nrespect to (3.3)] to T as nm \u2192 \u221e.\nThen E[\u03c8 \u2032(\u03b8m)|ys] converges to Cm = \u03c8 \u2032(T ).\nREMARK 3.1. As before, we can check that the regularity conditions (R.3)\nand (R.4) are satisfied for all three examples in the Appendix and that in each case\nCm = y\u00afm. Verification of (R.4) is similar to that of (R.2). Verification of (R.3) may\nDESIGN-CONSISTENCY OF HB ESTIMATORS 729\nbe facilitated by noting that\ng(\u03b8m) \u2264\n\u222b m\u22121\u220f\ni=1\n{\nh\u2032(\u03b8i)\nni\u220f\nj=1\nexp[\u03c6\u22121{yij \u03b8i \u2212 \u03c8(\u03b8i)}]\n}\n\u00d7\n[\na +\nm\u2211\ni=1\nh2(\u03b8i)\n]\u2212(b+m\u22121)\/2 m\u22121\u220f\ni=1\nd\u03b8i.\nFor example, in the case of normal distribution,\ng(\u03b8m) \u2264 [a + \u03b82m]\u2212(b+m\u22121)\/2\n\u222b m\u22121\u220f\ni=1\nni\u220f\nj=1\nexp[\u03c3\u22122{yij \u03b8i \u2212 \u03b82i \/2}]\nm\u22121\u220f\ni=1\nd\u03b8i < \u221e.\nThe following theorem is an immediate consequence of Lemma 3.1. The theorem\nsuggests a simple adjustment to the hierarchical Bayes estimator to achieve the\ndesign-consistency property.\nTHEOREM 3.1. In addition to the regularity conditions of Lemma 3.1, assume\nthat fnm := nm\/Nm \u2192 fm for some 0 < fm < 1. Let \u0006\u0302YHBm be the hierarchical\nBayes estimator of \u0006Ym. Then\n\u0006\u0302YHBm \u2192 fmy\u00afm + (1 \u2212 fm)Cm\nas nm \u2192 \u221e.\nLet y\u00afmw be any design-consistent estimator of \u0006Ym. Then \u0006\u0302Ym = \u0006\u0302YHBm \u2212{fmy\u00afm +\n(1\u2212fm)Cm\u2212 y\u00afmw} is design-consistent, based on the hierarchical Bayes estimator.\nNow consider case (ii). Suppose \u03c6, \u03b2 and r are mutually independent. Further-\nmore, let v := 1\/\u03c6 \u223c U(0,\u221e), \u03b2 \u223c U(\u2212\u221e,\u221e) and r \u223c G(a,b).\nIn this case, we will consider the normal distribution only, since \u03c6 is known for\nthe binomial and Poisson examples. Since h(\u03b8) = \u03b8 , integrating (3.1) with respect\nto \u03b2 , r and v (in that order), we obtain\n\u03c0(\u03b8 |ys)\n(3.4)\n\u221d\n{\nm\u2211\ni=1\nni\u2211\nj=1\n(yij \u2212 \u03b8i)2\n}\u2212(nT \/2+1)[\na +\nm\u2211\ni=1\n{\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8\u00af}2\n]\u2212(b+m\u22121)\/2\n,\nwhere nT =\u2211mi=1 ni . In the Appendix, we show that\nE[\u03c8 \u2032(\u03b8m)|ys] \u2192 y\u00afm.(3.5)\n730 P. LAHIRI AND K. MUKHERJEE\n4. Uncertainty measures. A conventional measure of uncertainty of the hier-\narchical Bayes estimator \u0006\u0302YHBm is simply the posterior variance V (\u0006Ym|ys). Noting\nthat V (\u0006Ym|ys) = E[(\u0006\u0302YHBm \u2212 \u0006Ym)2|ys], we may define a measure of uncertainty\n(MU) of \u0006\u0302Ym as\nMU(1)m = E[(\u0006\u0302Ym \u2212 \u0006Ym)2|ys] = V (\u0006Ym|ys) + [\u0006\u0302Ym \u2212 \u0006\u0302YHBm ]2.\nThus, in order to achieve design-consistency, we increase this measure by\n[\u0006\u0302Ym \u2212 \u0006\u0302YHBm ]2. However, this apparent increase may be misleading, since this will\nonly happen if the assumed hierarchical model holds for all units of the finite\npopulation, an assumption hard to justify for the unobserved units of the finite\npopulation based on the observed units in the sample.\nWe now propose an alternative measure of uncertainty following the work\nof Prasad and Rao [20], who considered a design-consistent pseudo-EBLUP for\na nested error regression model. Following their approach, we define the mean\nsquared error of \u0006\u0302Ym as\nMSE(\u0006\u0302Ym) = E[\u0006\u0302Ym \u2212 \u03b7m]2,\nwhere \u03b7m = E(\u0006Ym|\u03b8m), the expectation being taken over the first two levels of the\nhierarchical model. Unlike the previous approach, this approach does not require\nextensive model assumptions regarding the unobserved units of the finite popula-\ntion, except for the mild assumption of the existence of a random effect \u03b8m. This\nis certainly an advantage of this approach over the previous approach.\nLet \u03b7\u02c6Bm = \u03b7\u02c6Bm(\u03c6) be the Bayes estimator of \u03b7m. Note that\nMSE(\u0006\u0302Ym) = h1m(\u03c6) + h2m(\u03c6),\nwhere h1m(\u03c6) = E[\u03b7\u02c6Bm \u2212 \u03b7m]2 and h2m(\u03c6) = E[\u0006\u0302Ym \u2212 \u03b7\u02c6Bm]2. It is possible to write\ndown an explicit expression for h1m(\u03c6), although it may not be in closed form.\nLet \u03c6\u02c6 be any commonly used consistent estimator of \u03c6. For example, in a mixed\nlinear normal model, we can consider the residual maximum likelihood estimators\n(REML) for the variance components and weighted least squares with estimated\nvariance components for the regression coefficients. We can estimate h1m(\u03c6) by\nh1m(\u03c6\u02c6) and h2m(\u03c6) by h\u02c62m(\u03c6\u02c6) = [\u0006\u0302Ym \u2212 \u03b7\u02c6EBm ]2, where \u03b7\u02c6EBm = \u03b7\u02c6Bm(\u03c6\u02c6), an empir-\nical Bayes estimator of \u03b7m. We propose the following as the second measure of\nuncertainty of \u0006\u0302Ym:\nMU(2)m = h1m(\u03c6\u02c6) + h\u02c62m(\u03c6\u02c6).\nNote that MU(2)m does not incorporate the variability due to the estimation of \u03c6.\nOn the other hand, MU(1)m incorporates all sources of variability, but may be sensi-\ntive to the specification of the prior distribution on \u03c6. Thus, as a compromise, we\npropose the following measure of uncertainty:\nMU(3)m =\nMU(1)m + MU(2)m\n2\n.\nDESIGN-CONSISTENCY OF HB ESTIMATORS 731\n5. A Monte Carlo simulation. In this section, we conduct a Monte Carlo\nsimulation study to compare the performances of MU(1),MU(2) and MU(3), pro-\nposed in Section 4. In particular, we study the performances of these measures in\nestimating the design-based mean squared error defined as MSEd(\u0006\u0302Ym) = Ed(\u0006\u0302Ym\u2212\u0006Ym)2, where Ed denotes an expectation with respect to the sampling design.\nWe consider 100 finite populations, each of size 60. The main variable Y\nis generated for each unit of the finite populations using a nested error model\nYij = \u00b5 + vi + eij , where \u00b5 is the fixed effect, vi \u223c N(0, \u03c3 2v ) are the random\neffects and eij \u223c N(0, \u03c3 2e ), with the {vi}\u2019s and the pure errors {eij }\u2019s assumed to\nbe independent, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 Ni = 60. We set \u00b5 = 50 and \u03c3v = 1 and\nconsider two different values of \u03c3e, namely \u03c3e = 1 and 2.\nWe draw a sample of size n from each finite population using a probability\nproportional to size with replacement (PPSWR) sampling design. We consider\nthree different choices of n, namely 10, 20 and 30. The size measure is gener-\nated for each unit of the finite populations using an exponential distribution with\nmean 1.\nFlat priors on the hyperparameters are used to obtain the posterior mean and the\nposterior variance needed to compute MU(1). We use PROC MIXED in SAS to\ngenerate 1050 observations from the posterior distributions, but only the last 1000\nobservations are retained for approximating the posterior means and variances.\nEssentially, PROC MIXED uses a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique.\nPROC IML is used to obtain the required posterior means and posterior variances.\nFor the second measure MU(2), \u03c6 is estimated by the residual maximum likelihood\n(REML) method.\nThe relative bias (RB) and relative root mean square error (RRMSE) for the\ni-population (1 \u2264 i \u2264 100) using the kth measure of uncertainty (1 \u2264 k \u2264 3) are\ndefined as\nRB(k)i =\nEd [MU(k)i ] \u2212 MSEd(\u0006\u0302Y i)\nMSEd(\u0006\u0302Y i)\nand\nRRMSE(k)i =\n\u221a\nEd [MU(k)i \u2212 MSEd(\u0006\u0302Y i)]2\nMSEd(\u0006\u0302Y i)\n,\nrespectively. Table 1 reports the average RB {ARB(k);1 \u2264 k \u2264 3} and average\nRRMSE {ARRMSE(k);1 \u2264 k \u2264 3} for different combinations of (n, \u03c3e), the av-\nerage being taken over all 100 finite populations. In terms of ARB, it appears that\nthe measure MU(1) has a slight tendency to overestimate the design-based MSE,\nwhereas MU(2) has a slight tendency to underestimate. This is probably due to\nthe fact that MU(1) attempts to incorporate all sources of variability, while MU(2)\ndoes not incorporate the variability in estimating \u03c6. It is interesting to note that\n732 P. LAHIRI AND K.

This behavior can\nbe explained by the pattern of the inclusion probabilities induced by our sampling\ndesign; see [15] for details. In terms of the ARRMSE, MU(2) is better than both\nMU(1) and MU(3). Overall, the measure MU(3) is a compromise between MU(1)\nand MU(2).\n6. Concluding remarks. In this paper, we examine a useful asymptotic be-\nhavior of the hierarchical Bayes estimator of a finite population mean. This leads\nto a simple method for constructing a design-consistent model-based estimator of\na finite population mean. The method is general, in that it can be easily applied\nto both normal and nonnormal cases and is applicable to any complex weighting\nscheme. We have also addressed the important issue of measuring uncertainty of\nour proposed estimator. The simulation study reveals that our second measure suf-\nfers from a slight downward design-based bias. In the future, the Taylor series or\na parametric bootstrap method as in [14] may be considered in an effort to reduce\nthe bias. It is conceivable that our method extends beyond the stratified sampling\ndesign, for example, the multi-stage sampling design considered in [7] and [17],\nbut this needs further research.\nAPPENDIX\nProof of Lemma 2.1. First we compute E[\u03c8 \u2032(\u03b8)|ys]. Using (2.1), (2.2) and\nthe fact that if a random variable h(\u03b8) has density d(\u00b7), then \u03b8 has density\nd{h(\u03b8)}h\u2032(\u03b8), we obtain the conditional density\n\u03c0(\u03b8 |ys) \u221d exp[\u2212(r\/2){h(\u03b8) \u2212 \u03b2}2]h\u2032(\u03b8)\n(A.1)\n\u00d7 exp[\u2212n\u03c6\u22121\u03c8(\u03b8)] \u00d7 exp[\u03c6\u22121ny\u00afs\u03b8 ].\nDESIGN-CONSISTENCY OF HB ESTIMATORS 733\nThis yields\nE[\u03c8 \u2032(\u03b8)|ys]\n=\n{\u222b\n\u03c8 \u2032(t) exp[\u2212(r\/2){h(t) \u2212 \u03b2}2]h\u2032(t) exp[\u2212n\u03c6\u22121\u03c8(t)] exp[\u03c6\u22121ny\u00afst]dt\n}\n\u00f7\n{\u222b\nexp[\u2212(r\/2){h(t) \u2212 \u03b2}2]h\u2032(t) exp[\u2212n\u03c6\u22121\u03c8(t)] exp[\u03c6\u22121ny\u00afst]dt\n}\n,\nwhich is a function of n and y\u00afs .\nTherefore,\nE[\u03c8 \u2032(\u03b8)|ys] = {ETn[\u03c8 \u2032(Tn) exp[\u2212(r\/2){h(Tn) \u2212 \u03b2}2]h\u2032(Tn)]}(A.2)\n\u00f7 {ETn[exp[\u2212(r\/2){h(Tn) \u2212 \u03b2}2]h\u2032(Tn)]},\nwhere the expectation in (A.2) is taken with respect to a random variable Tn with\ndensity (2.4). The proof now follows by using the bounded convergence theorem\non both the numerator and the denominator of (A.2).\nVerification of the conditions of Lemma 2.1. When \u03c6 is known in (2.1), we\nverify the conditions of Lemma 2.1 for the Gaussian, Bernoulli and Poisson distri-\nbutions. Verification of (R.1) is trivial.\nEXAMPLE 1. Suppose that conditional on \u03b8 , Y is normal with mean \u03b8 and\nvariance \u03c3 2. Then equation (2.4) becomes\nexp[\u2212nt2\/(2\u03c3 2)] exp[tny\u00afs\/\u03c3 2]\n\/\u222b\nexp[\u2212n\u03c4 2\/(2\u03c3 2)] exp[\u03c4ny\u00afs\/\u03c3 2]d\u03c4,\na normal density with mean y\u00afs and variance \u03c3 2\/n. Hence, T = y\u00afs and C = y\u00afs .\nEXAMPLE 2. Suppose that conditional on \u03b8 , Y is Bernoulli with success prob-\nability \u03b3 = e\u03b8\/(1 + e\u03b8 ). The numerator of (2.4) becomes\nety\u00afsn\/(1 + et )n = [et\/(1 + et )]ny\u00afs [1 \u2212 et\/(1 + et )]n\u2212ny\u00afs .\nHence, Vn := eTn\/(1 + eTn) has a Beta distribution converging to y\u00afs . Therefore,\nC = \u03c8 \u2032(T ) = y\u00afs .\nEXAMPLE 3. Suppose that conditional on \u03b8 , Y is Poisson with success rate\n\u03bb = e\u03b8 . The numerator of (2.4) becomes exp[\u2212n(et \u2212 t y\u00afs)]. Hence, Vn := eTn\nhas the Gamma density e\u2212nvvny\u00afs\u22121I (v > 0)\/\r(ny\u00afs). Since E(Vn) = y\u00afs and\nVar(Vn) \u2192 0, Vn converges to y\u00afs . Therefore, C = \u03c8 \u2032(T ) = y\u00afs .\n734 P. LAHIRI AND K. MUKHERJEE\nVERIFICATION OF (3.2).

MUKHERJEE\nFor simplicity, write n for nm. Note that hn is a density of the form c\/{n(x \u2212\n\u00b5)2 + d}n\/2+1. Clearly, the mean is \u00b5. To prove convergence in probability, we\nnext show that for any \u03b51 > 0,\u222b \u221e\n\u03b51\n(nx2 + d)\u2212(n\/2+1) dx\n\/\u222b \u221e\n0\n(nx2 + d)\u2212(n\/2+1) dx \u2192 0.(A.10)\nSubstituting x = (d\/n)1\/2y, the above becomes equals \u222b\u221en1\/2\u03b5(y2 + 1)\u2212(n\/2+1)dy\/\u222b\u221e\n0 (y\n2 + 1)\u2212(n\/2+1) dy, where \u03b5 := \u03b51\/d1\/2. The numerator is bounded above by\u222b\u221e\nn1\/2\u03b5(n\n1\/2\u03b5y + 1)\u2212(n\/2+1) dy, which is O(1\/{n3\/2(n1\/2\u03b5)n}). The denominator is\nbounded below by\n\u222b\n(2ey)\u2212n dy = O(1\/n2n). Hence, (A.10) follows.\nAcknowledgments.
