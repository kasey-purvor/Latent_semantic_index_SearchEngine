Introduction\n[2] This paper aims to assess the ability of numerical ice\nsheet models to simulate the migration of the grounding\nline. In particular, we compare the grounding line dynamics\npredicted by a range of models of marine ice sheets, and\ninvestigate the influence of numerics on these predictions.\nWe further investigate the role of mechanical coupling over\nthe grounding line in determining the migration of the\ngrounding line.\n[3] Marine ice sheets rest on a bed well below sea level\nand drainage usually takes place through floating ice\nshelves. The stability of a marine ice sheet is thought to\nbe controlled by the dynamics of the grounding line (the\njunction between the grounded ice sheet and a floating ice\nshelf or the ocean). Glaciologists generally agree that\nmarine ice sheets are more likely to undergo rapid change\nthan land-based ice sheets [Bentley, 1998].\n[4] Most parts of the present-day West Antarctic ice sheet\n(WAIS) are well below sea level and this has led various\nauthors to speculate on its stability. In the past, the WAIS\nhas grown and shrunk and may even have disappeared\nentirely, however we do not know in detail how rapidly\nthese changes occurred [Alley and Bindschadler, 2001].\nThere is however strong evidence that the marine portions\nof the Eurasian ice sheet disintegrated within a short time\n[Siegert and Dowdeswell, 2002]. Although changes in the\nWAIS are likely to be linked to changes in global sea level,\nthere is little direct correlation in the timing of deglaciation\nand sea level rise [Anderson and Shipp, 2001; Conway et\nal., 1999]. If the entire WAIS were discharged into the\nocean, global sea level would rise by 5 to 6 m [Bentley,\n1998]. The magnitude of this effect has led to the identifi-\ncation of the future of the WAIS as a key uncertainty in our\nability to predict future sea level change. Accurate modeling\nof the migration of the grounding line is therefore crucial to\nthe validity of these predictions.\n[5] Up to the present, only a few attempts have been\nmade to simulate grounding line migration within marine\nice sheet models, and none of these simulations explicitly\nconsiders ice stream dynamics. Such models can be divided\ninto two main classes. The first group of numerical models\nconsiders an ice sheet that is coupled mechanically and\/or\nthrough the thickness evolution equation to an ice shelf and\na flotation criterion is used to identify whether ice is\ngrounded or floating at a particular grid point [Huybrechts,\n1990; Ritz et al., 2001; Van der Veen, 1985]. In general,\nthese models use a fixed horizontal grid and have mainly\nbeen used to reconstruct the evolution of Antarctica\n[Huybrechts and De Wolde, 1999; Huybrechts, 2002; Ritz et\nal., 2001]. They show a thinning and retreat during the most\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 110, F01003, doi:10.1029\/2004JF000202, 2005\nCopyright 2005 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/05\/2004JF000202$09.00\nF01003 1 of 18\nrecent deglaciation, which approximately follows the exter-\nnal sea level forcing and therefore contradicts the observation\nthat postglacial retreat along the Siple Coast occurred very\nlate [Anderson and Shipp, 2001; Conway et al., 1999].\n[6] Furthermore, these models incorporate a static ice\nstream hydrology (an effective pressure-dependent sliding\nrelation with water pressure set to sea level) that is believed\nto be crucial in allowing the modeled WAIS to undergo\nsubstantial retreat but whose validity is somewhat suspect\n[see Hindmarsh and LeMeur, 2001]. This means that the\nretreat and thinning produced by these models may be\noccurring for the wrong reasons. In addition, the grounding\nline motion is found to be rather sensitive to the computed\ntemperature (effective viscosity) within the ice shelves\n[Huybrechts and De Wolde, 1999]. More importantly, the\ngrounding line motion predicted in these models has yet to\nbe shown to be independent of the models\u2019 numerics.\n[7] A second group of models only considers the\ngrounded part of a marine ice sheet and does not include\nmechanical coupling or coupling through mass conservation\nat the grounding line. Several studies indicate that longitu-\ndinal coupling at the grounding line is less important than\npreviously supposed [Hindmarsh, 1993; Whillans and Van\nder Veen, 1993; Echelmeyer et al., 1994; Bentley, 1997]. A\nfurther argument for ignoring the ice shelf is that if the\ngrounded part of a marine ice sheet is sufficiently described\nby the shallow ice approximation (SIA [Hutter, 1983]), in\nwhich the gravitational driving stresses are exclusively\nbalanced by local vertical stress gradients, then longitudinal\nstresses are not significant and coupling with the shelf\ncan not be important [Hindmarsh and LeMeur, 2001].\nHindmarsh [1996] has explicitly shown that a marine ice\nsheet, that is described by the SIA and which has no\nmechanical coupling to an ice shelf, exhibits neutral equi-\nlibria. This means the equilibrium position is continuous\nand that an infinity of equilibrium configurations exists\n[Hindmarsh, 1993]. Furthermore, he showed that for marine\nice sheets the neutral equilibrium is an attractive state,\nmeaning the system is stable and finds a steady state after\na small perturbation. These models use a stretched horizon-\ntal grid and the motion of the grounding line is calculated\nusing a prognostic equation. Their dynamics are shown to\nbe consistent with their underlying differential equations\n(which imply neutral equilibrium). A detailed description of\nthese models and their dynamics are given by Hindmarsh\n[1996], LeMeur and Hindmarsh [2001], and Hindmarsh\nand LeMeur [2001].\n[8] One important result from these studies is that sea\nlevel changes alone can not explain the observed 500 km\nretreat of the WAIS during the most recent deglaciation\n[LeMeur and Hindmarsh, 2001]. However, the inclusion of\ninternal oscillations, either specified or generated via the\nMacAyeal-Payne thermal mechanism, does produce the\nobserved range of grounding line migration [Hindmarsh\nand LeMeur, 2001]. Whether one can generally ignore\nmechanical coupling and\/or coupling through the mass\nconservation at the grounding line is still an open question.\nIn particular, it seems likely that coupling between ice\nstreams (where the SIA is not applicable) and shelves must\nbe stronger than between sheets (obeying SIA) and shelves.\n[9] Up to the present, the dynamics of the grounding line\nare poorly understood and no clear picture is available on\nhow the grounding line should react to a change in external\nforcing. This study therefore tries to compare the different\nways of treating grounding line migration within marine ice\nsheet models. This includes the influence of numerical\ndetails and discretization on the dynamics of the grounding\nline, as well as the importance of mechanical coupling at the\ngrounding line.\n[10] This assessment is undertaken on \u2018\u2018simple\u2019\u2019 versions\nof the two different model groups discussed above. The\nmain simplifications are that only plane flow is considered\nand the ice sheet is assumed to be isothermal. Furthermore,\nisostatic adjustment of the bed is not considered. Although,\nthese simplifications may limit quantitative model predic-\ntions, they do not affect the main aim of this study, which is\nto compare different grounding line migration models and\nto test whether these models depend on their numerics. If\nthe behavior of these simplified one-dimensional plane flow\nmodels is dependent on their numerics (or the way in which\nthe grounding line is treated), then the original large-scale\ntwo-dimensional models are also expected to show these\ndependencies. By deliberately choosing to work with sim-\nplified models, we hope to be able to identify these\ndependencies more easily than is the case with more\ncomplex models, where many processes are likely to affect\ngrounding line motion and assessing cause and effect is\nconsequently more difficult.\n2. Model Descriptions\n[11] This study focusses on the numerical modeling of the\nevolution of a marine ice sheet with or without an ice shelf,\nand in particular on modeling the migration of the ground-\ning line. All the models used in this paper are two-\ndimensional isothermal plane flow models, that means the\nrate factor is constant throughout the ice sheet and only flow\nand thickness changes in x direction are considered and in y\ndirection the ice body is assumed to extend infinitely. The z\ncoordinate is the vertical direction and is positive upward.\n2.1. Governing Equations\n[12] The evolution of the ice thickness of a marine ice\nsheet for plane flow is described by\n@h\n@t\n\u00bc a\u0002 @q\n@x\n; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere t is the time, a the accumulation rate and q is the\nhorizontal flux of ice through a vertical column of ice with\nthickness h and is given by q = hu, where u is the vertically\naveraged horizontal ice velocity.\n[13] In this study we consider the three distinct flow\nregimes of a marine ice sheet, namely ice sheets, ice streams\nand ice shelves. The physics that determines the flow of ice\nis the same for all cases and based on the conservation of\nmass and momentum and the constitutive equation for ice\n(Glen\u2019s flow law [Glen, 1955]), however, the boundary\nconditions, in particular at the ice base, are very different\nand therefore the governing terms that determine the flow\nare different. We consider here the simplest cases of ice\nsheet, ice stream and ice shelf flow.\n2.1.1. Ice Sheet\n[14] For the ice sheet flow we use the SIA [Hutter, 1983],\nwhich assumes that the horizontal flow is due to vertical\nF01003 VIELI AND PAYNE: MODELING GROUNDING LINE MIGRATION\n2 of 18\nF01003\nshearing alone. Assuming no sliding at the bed the vertically\naveraged horizontal velocity u is given by\nu \u00bc C @s\n@x\n\u0001 \u0002n\nhn\u00fe1; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere s is the surface elevation, n the flow law exponent in\nGlen\u2019s flow law and the constant C is given by\nC \u00bc 2A rig\u00f0 \u00de\nn\nn\u00fe 2 ; \u00f03\u00de\nwhere A is the rate factor, ri the density of ice and g the\nacceleration due to gravity.\n2.1.2. Ice Shelf\n[15] The governing equation for an ice shelf that is\nallowed to spread unidirectionally along the x axis is given\nby\n2\n@\n@x\nhn\n@u\n@x\n\u00bc righ\n@s\n@x\n; \u00f04\u00de\nwhere n is the vertically averaged effective viscosity\nn \u00bc A\u00021=n _\u0004 1\u0002n\u00f0 \u00de=n \u00bc A\u00021=n @u\n@x\n\u0001 \u00022\" # 1\u0002n\u00f0 \u00de= 2n\u00f0 \u00de\n; \u00f05\u00de\nand _\u0004 is the vertically averaged effective strain rate given by\n_\u0004 = j@u\/@xj.\n2.1.3. Ice Stream\n[16] For an ice stream, we modify equation (4) by adding\na resistance from the bed which is assumed to be linearly\nrelated to the velocity u at the bed (a viscous till is\nassumed). The equation determining the vertically averaged\nice stream velocity u is then\n2\n@\n@x\nhn\n@u\n@x\n\u0002 b2u \u00bc righ\n@s\n@x\n; \u00f06\u00de\nwhere b2 is a friction coefficient to be specified. Equation (6)\nindicates that the driving stress on the right-hand side is\nbalanced by basal traction and longitudinal stress gradients\nalone. Equations (4) and (6) both ignore lateral resistance to\nflow, which is thought to be particularly important for ice\nstreams [Whillans and Van der Veen, 1997]. However, we\ndo not regard this as important for the purposes of our study\nfor three main reasons. First, Van der Veen and Whillans\n[1996] propose a parameterization of lateral resistance in\nterms of ice stream width W and velocity u given by\n2\n@\n@x\nhn\n@u\n@x\n\u0002 b2u\u0002 h\nW\n5u\n2AW\n\u0001 \u00021=3\n\u00bc righ\n@s\n@x\n: \u00f07\u00de\nBy omitting the lateral resistance we implicitly include\na linearized version (with constant width) of this\nparameterization subsumed within the resistance of the\nbed. Second, this study is focussed on large ice shelves,\nsuch as the major present-day Ronne-Filchner and Ross\nice shelves as well as the former outer shelves\nfringing Antarctica, for which lateral drag is expected to\nbe small. Third, the main purpose of the stream shelf\nmodel is to investigate the influence of the longitudinal\nstress coupling on the migration of the grounding line.\nWe select a low value for the basal resistance of b2 =\n1.0 \u0007 109 Pa s m\u00021 which is consistent with values\nfound for the Siple coast ice streams [MacAyeal et al.,\n1995].\n2.1.4. Boundary Conditions\n[17] The ice sheet is assumed to be symmetric at the ice\ndivide, which implies that @s\/@x = 0 and the horizontal flux\nis zero at the divide (@q\/@x = 0). At the shelf-ocean\nboundary the longitudinal stress is balanced by the hydro-\nstatic pressure of the ocean water. Using Glen\u2019s flow law\nand assuming no spreading to the sides, the boundary\ncondition at the shelf front is given by [Paterson, 1994,\np. 296]\n@u\n@x\n\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\nshelffront\n\u00bc A 1\n4\nrig 1\u0002\nri\nrw\n\u0001 \u0002\u0006 \u0007n\nhn; \u00f08\u00de\nwhere rw = 1028 kg m\n\u00023 is the density of the ocean water.\n2.2. Numerical Models\n[18] The two sets of numerical models that are used to\nsolve the equations above differ mainly in the way the\ngrounding line is treated and consequently the kind of grid\nthat is used. The models are described below and an\noverview is given in Table 1. We refer to the various\nmodels using six-letter acronyms (see Table 1), in which\nthe first two characters (FG = fixed grid\/MG = moving\ngrid) refer to the type of grid, the second two to the\ngrounded ice model (SH = sheet\/ST = stream) and the\nTable 1.

Fixed Grid Models\n[19] The first set of models is based on a fixed horizontal\ngrid and the flotation condition is used to decide where the\nice is grounded or is part of the shelf, which is given by\nrih \u00bc rw l \u0002 b\u00f0 \u00de; \u00f09\u00de\nwhere ri and rw are the densities of ice and water\nrespectively, l is sea level and b is the elevation of the ice\nsheet base. The grounding line position is therefore not\ndefined explicitly but must fall between grid points where\nice is grounded and floating. This method has been used in\nlarge ice sheet models to calculate the migration of the\ngrounding line [Ritz et al., 2001; Huybrechts and De Wolde,\n1999; Huybrechts, 1990]. We apply the fixed grid model to\ntwo different flow regimes in the grounded part: (1) an ice\nsheet (equation (2), denoted as FGSHSF model) and (2) an\nice stream (equation (6), denoted as FGSTSF model) both\nwith an ice shelf attached to it.\n[20] In case of the FGSHSF model, at the last grounded\npoint the horizontal flux is given as input to the ice shelf part\nof the model. This means no explicit mechanical coupling\nbetween ice sheet and ice shelf is considered at the grounding\nline, however the ice shelf evolution canmodify inland ice by\nthe mechanism of geometry change through the thickness\nevolution equation (equation (1) [Ritz et al., 2001]). For\nmodeling the Antarctic ice sheet, Huybrechts [1990, 1992]\nconsidered mechanical coupling at the grounding line by\nincorporating a decrease in ice viscosity induced by longitu-\ndinal stresses at the grounding zone to evaluate the fluxes\nthere. However, in his model this zone is represented only by\nthe last grounded grid cell and the way it is included appears\nto be fairly arbitrary. Additional model calculations with such\na scheme showed (at least for 2D plane flow) no significant\ndifference to our simple mechanically uncoupled model.\nThus we assume that the FGSHSF model represents the\ncurrently existing and applied ensemble of fixed grid ice\nsheet models that use the flotation condition (equation (9)) to\npredict grounding line changes [Huybrechts, 2002; Ritz et al.,\n2001; Huybrechts and De Wolde, 1999; Huybrechts, 1992,\n1990]. The relevant equations are solved numerically using\nfinite differences. In general centered differences are used\nand the velocities and fluxes are calculated on a staggered\ngrid (see Appendix B). The ice shelf equation (4) and ice\nstream equation (6) are solved by iterating for the effective\nviscosity n. For the thickness evolution (equation (1)), an\nexplicit forward time-stepping scheme is used with a constant\ntime step Dt.\n2.2.2. Moving Grid Models\n[21] The second set of models is based on a moving grid\nwhich allows the grounding line position to be followed\ncontinuously and uses an expression for the grounding line\nmigration rate to compute the grounding line motion.\nFollowing Hindmarsh [1996], from a total differentiation\nof the flotation condition (equation (9)) the grounding line\nmigration rate _Lg is given by\n_Lg \u00bc dLg\ndt\n\u00bc\nrw\nri\n@f\n@t\n\u00fe @q\n@x\n\u0002 a\n@h\n@x\n\u0002 rw\nri\n@f\n@x\n; \u00f010\u00de\nwhere all quantities are evaluated at the grounding line\nposition, Lg is the distance of the grounding line from the\nice divide and f = l \u0002 h is the water depth at the grounding\nline. The ice divide is located at x = 0 and the grounding line\nat x = Lg.\n2.2.2.1. MGSHXX Model\n[22] The first moving grid model only considers a\ngrounded ice sheet and ignores any coupling to an ice shelf\n(noted as MGSHXX). The model has been described and\napplied by Hindmarsh [1996], Hindmarsh and LeMeur\n[2001], and LeMeur and Hindmarsh [2001], and dynamical\nconsistency has been shown to exist between the governing\nequations and the corresponding discretized (finite differ-\nence) approximation [Hindmarsh, 1996]. In particular, this\nmeans that the numerical model can exhibit neutral equi-\nlibria. To accurately compute the motion of the grounding\nline a normalized horizontal coordinate x = x\/Lg is intro-\nduced. The position of the ice divide and the grounding line\ncorrespond to x = 0 and x = 1 respectively. A detailed\nderivation of the surface evolution and grounding line\nmigration equations into the transformed x coordinate\nsystem are given in Appendix A.\n[23] For the MGSHXX model we follow the discretiza-\ntion scheme suggested by LeMeur and Hindmarsh [2001]\nand Hindmarsh and LeMeur [2001]. In general, centered\nfinite differences are used except at the grounding line\nwhere upstream differences are used for the thickness and\nsurface slope, and the flux divergence (for details of the\ndiscretization, see Appendix B).\n2.2.2.2. MGSTSF Model\n[24] Following the architecture of the MGSHXX model\nabove, an ice stream model that is mechanically coupled to\nan ice shelf has been developed (noted as MGSTSF). In this\ncase, we follow the shelf front position Ltot as well as the\ngrounding line position. We therefore use a piecewise\ncoordinate transformation and introduce a new coordinate\nx given by\nx \u00bc\nr\nLg\nx ice sheet : x \b Lg\n1\u0002 r\nLs\nx\u00fe rLtot \u0002 Lg\nLs\nice shelf : x > Lg\n;\n8><\n>: \u00f011\u00de\nwhere r is the x coordinate of the grounding line position,\nwhich is independent of time and is chosen as 0 < r < 1 and\nLs = Ltot \u0002 Lg is the ice shelf length. The ice divide, the\ngrounding line position and the shelf front then correspond\nto x = 0, x = r and x = 1 respectively (Figure 1). The\nposition of the shelf front in the fixed grid model is fixed, so\nwe chose a fixed shelf front position here as well (@Ltot\/@t =\n0). A detailed formulation of the transformed field and\nsurface evolution equations, and the grounding line\nmigration equation is given in Appendix A.\n[25] For the MGSTSF model we tried to follow the\ndiscretization scheme of the MGSHXX model, so that in\ngeneral centered differences are used, except at the ground-\ning line where upstream differences are used again to\napproximate the thickness and surface slopes, and the flux\ndivergence (for details, see Appendix B). Because the shelf\nis also modeled we could alternatively use centered differ-\nences for the gradients at the grounding line (equation (10)).\nThe sensitivity of the model results on the discretization\nF01003 VIELI AND PAYNE: MODELING GROUNDING LINE MIGRATION\n4 of 18\nF01003\nscheme (centered or upstream) is therefore explored in a\nlater section. In contrast to the MGSHXX model, the\ngrounding line in this model is on the staggered grid (see\ndetails in section B2.2 and Figure B1). This was done to\nensure mass conservation over the grounding line.\n2.2.2.3. MGSHSF Model\n[26] A third moving grid model considers an ice sheet\ncoupled only by the flux at the grounding line to an ice\nshelf. This model employs the same piecewise coordinate\ntransformation as the MGSTSF model, and the grounding\nline is again on the staggered grid. This model was used to\ncompare the MGSTSF with a model that uses the same\ndiscretization scheme but different physics. This MGSHSF\nmodel did not give significantly different results to the one\nusing the scheme of the MGSHXX model.\n[27] For the thickness evolution in all moving grid\nmodels (MGSHXX, MGSTSF and MGSHSF), an explicit\nforward time-stepping scheme is used with a constant time\nstep Dt (for details, see Appendix B). The thickness evolu-\ntion scheme used in all models is mass conservative at the\ngrounding line.\n[28] Although finite difference schemes are not formally\nmass conserving at the grounding line, we have checked\nthat mass is indeed conserved in all the fixed and moving\ngrid models above.\n3. EISMINT Grounding Line Migration\nExperiments\n[29] Although, a few attempts have been made to model\ngrounding line migration, the only comparison of grounding\nline treatments in numerical models was undertaken in\nthe European Ice Sheet Modelling Initiative (EISMINT)\nprogramme [Huybrechts, 1997]. All compared models used\na fixed grid and the experiments were restricted to one\ninitial geometry with a ice sheet length of 50 km and a shelf\nof the same length, and considered the plane flow case. A\nconstant rate factor corresponding to an ice temperature of\nabout \u000234\u0005C was used. This setting appears unrealistic and\nmay not represent the situation of the WAIS (or any large\nmarine ice sheet). However, it is the only known model\ncomparison for grounding line migration, so we base the\nfirst set of model experiments on the EISMINT setup. Here\nwe apply the ice sheet\/shelf models (FGSHSF and\nMGSHXX) and compare the results with the EISMINT\ncomparison study.\n3.1. Model Setup and Model Parameters\n[30] Following EISMINT, we consider an ice sheet of\n50 km initial length with an attached ice shelf of another\n50 km (Figure 2). The initial grid spacing in the x direction\nis 2 km resulting in 51 grid points of which the first 26 are\non grounded ice. The bed is an inclined plane with a slope\nof \u00020.005\u0005 and with an elevation of \u0002250 m at the ice\ndivide and \u0002750 m at the shelf front. The rate factor is A =\n1.0 \u0007 10\u000218 Pa\u00023 a\u00021 [Paterson and Budd, 1982].\n3.2. Experiments\n3.2.1. Steady State Calculations\n[31] First, a steady state geometry is allowed to develop\nfor an initial accumulation rate of 0.3 m a\u00021. For the\nFGSHSF model the last grounded grid point is fixed until\na steady state is reached and then the grounding line is\nallowed to freely evolve until a steady state is reached. After\nrelaxing of the initially fixed grounding line, the grounding\nline position is found to be stable and the geometry does not\nshow any further change. For the MGSHXX model, we start\nwith a numerical steady state solution following LeMeur\nand Hindmarsh [2001]. Allowing this solution to evolve\nwith time showed no change in the geometry, thus this\ninitial geometry is in a real steady state. In Figures 3\u20136, the\nfirst 5 ka show the initialization phase of the steady state for\nthe FGSHSF and the MGSHXX model respectively. The\ngeometry of the steady states (5 ka) which are used as initial\ngeometry for the following experiments are shown in\nFigure 2. For the grounded part, the steady geometries for\nboth models are almost identical.\n3.2.2. Step Change Experiments\n[32] Starting from the steady state geometries obtained\nabove, the response of the surface and the grounding line to\nstep changes of the accumulation rate from 0.3 m a\u00021 to\n0.5 m a\u00021 and to 0.1 m a\u00021, respectively, and to sea level\nchanges of \u00b1125 m are investigated. In Figures 3\u20136, these\nstep changes are made at 5 ka. After reaching a new steady\nFigure 1.

Change in Accumulation\n[33] For the FGSHSF model, for a step change in accu-\nmulation from 0.3 m a\u00021 to 0.5 m a\u00021 the grounding line did\nnot advance (Figure 3). However, by increasing the grid\nresolution from 51 to 91 grid points (Dx = 1.1 km instead of\n2 km) for the same experiment the grounding line advanced\nby about 5.5 km (five grid points) before finding a new\nsteady state. This indicates a grid-size dependency which\nwill be discussed in detail in a later section. After switching\nthe accumulation back to its initial value, the grounding line\ndid not retreat in the 91\u2013grid point run. Hence the change in\nFigure 3. Modeled response to a step change of the\naccumulation rate at time 5 ka from 0.3 m a\u00021 to 0.5 m a\u00021\n(solid lines) or to 0.1 m a\u00021 (dashed lines), respectively. At\ntime 15 ka the accumulation rate has been reset to 0.3 m\na\u00021.

At time 15 ka the\naccumulation rate has been reset to 0.3 m a\u00021. Here a rate\nfactor A corresponding to an ice temperature of \u000215\u0005C is\nused. The circles indicate the grounding line position\ncalculated by the MGSHXX model, and the triangles\nindicate the grounding line position calculated by the\nFGSHSF model. Note that for the FGSHSF model the\ngrounding line position for a higher horizontal grid\nresolution of Dx = 1.1 km is also shown.\nF01003 VIELI AND PAYNE: MODELING GROUNDING LINE MIGRATION\n6 of 18\nF01003\ngrounding line position in this experiment appears to be\nirreversible. For the experiment with a decrease in accumu-\nlation rate to 0.1 m a\u00021, no retreat is observed for the\nFGSHSF model (Figure 3). An increase in grid resolution\nhere did not change the result.\n[34] For the MGSHXX model, results are distinctly\ndifferent (Figure 3). As demonstrated by Hindmarsh\n[1996] and Hindmarsh and LeMeur [2001], for any kind\nof change in accumulation the grounding line migrates and\nafter resetting accumulation, the grounding line goes back to\nits original position. Thus here we have a reversible system.\nThere seems to be no indication that an advance is preferred\nover a retreat. The magnitude of grounding line change is in\nthe order \u00b11 km and is small relatively to the changes\nobtained from the FGSHSF model (in the cases where a\nchange has occurred).\n3.2.2.2. Change in Sea Level\n[35] For a step change in sea level to \u00b1125 m the results\nare shown in Figure 4. For a rise of sea level, the FGSHSF\nmodel shows an immediate retreat of the grounding line, but\nonly by one grid point (2 km). After resetting sea level to\nzero it readvances back to its initial position. For a decrease\nin sea level to \u0002125 m, the grounding line advances by five\ngrid points (10 km) and after resetting sea level to 0 m the\ngrounding line only retreats by one grid point and does not\ngo back to the initial position.\n[36] A step change in sea level does not occur in reality\nand is an unsuitable experiment for the MGSHXX model\nbecause the calculation of the grounding line migration rate\n(equation (10)) explicitly uses the water depth changing rate\n@f\/@t which is infinite in case of a step sea level change.\nTherefore in the further experiments, we apply a gradual\nchange of sea level by \u00b1125 m over a period of 1 ka\n(Figure 5a).\n[37] The results for a gradual change in sea level over 1 ka\nfor the FGSHSF model (Figure 5) are qualitatively very\nsimilar to the step change experiment (Figure 4). The only\ndifference is that, in the case of sea level rise, the grounding\nline does not retreat and the increase in sea level only results\nin a thickening of the grounded part.\n[38] For the MGSHXX model, a gradual rise of the sea\nlevel to +125 m results in a retreat of the grounding line of\n2 km and for a sea level lowering the grounding line\nadvances by 1.5 km (Figure 5). Again the total amount of\ngrounding line change is small relative to the changes of the\nFGSHSF model, if they occur at all. For both cases, after\nresetting sea level to 0 m at 15 ka (or at any other time) the\ngrounding line position goes back to its initial value.\n[39] Note that a realistic timescale for sea level changes of\nthis order of magnitude is 10 ka, as occurred at the transition\nfrom the Last Glacial Maximum to the Holocene. Our sea\nlevel change experiment is therefore fairly extreme, but it\nallows a comparison to the step change experiments in the\nEISMINT study. Furthermore, additional calculations with a\ngradual change of sea level to \u00b1125 m over a period of\n10 ka, show the same results for total amount of change in\ngeometry and grounding line position, although the timing\nis different.\n3.2.2.3. Sensitivity to Rate Factor\n[40] The chosen value of A = 1.0 \u0007 10\u000218 Pa\u00023 a\u00021 in the\nEISMINT comparison (corresponding to a temperature of\n\u000234\u0005C) is rather too low to be realistic. We therefore\nrepeated the accumulation step change experiment with a\nrate factor of A = 9.2 \u0007 10\u000218Pa\u00023 a\u00021 (corresponding to\n\u000215\u0005C). The results are shown in Figure 6. The qualitative\nresults for the MGSHXX model are very similar to the\nexperiments with the colder ice, although the absolute\nvalues of grounding line change are slightly larger. For\nthe FGSHSF model the results are significantly different.\nFor an increase of the accumulation rate to 0.5 m a\u00021, the\ngrounding line does not advance even for increased grid\nresolution up to Dx = 0.67 km (151 grid points) instead of\n2 km (51 grid points). For a decrease of the accumulation\nrate to 0.1 m a\u00021, the grounding line starts to retreat very\nrapidly and the ice sheet disappears completely after 5 ka\nyears, although the retreat rate decreases toward the end.\nFor an increased horizontal grid resolution of Dx = 1.1 km\n(instead of 2 km), the retreat is much slower and the\ngrounding line reaches a steady state position which is\nabout two thirds of its initial position. Thus in contrast to\nthe tendency to advance shown in the previous EISMINT\ncase, a retreating tendency is observed.\n3.2.3. Sensitivity to Time Step and Grid Size\n[41] For both models, the sensitivity of the results to the\ngrid size and time step was also investigated. Experiments\nwith an accumulation step change to 0.1 m a\u00021 or to 0.5 m\na\u00021 or a gradual sea level change to \u00b1125 m over 1 ka were\nperformed for time steps between 5.0 and 0.1 years, and\nhorizontal grid sizes between 3.33 km and 0.77 km\n(corresponding to 31\u2013131 grid points along the domain).\nAs indicated above the amount of grounding line change\nobtained by the FGSHSF model strongly depends on the\nhorizontal grid size (Figure 7). For large grid sizes and small\nperturbations, no advance or retreat of the grounding line\noccurs. If any advance occurs, the amount of advance\nincreases with decreasing grid size. This grid size depen-\ndency seems to be mainly a consequence of using a fixed\ngrid. Whenever the grid is too sparse, thickening (or\nthinning) around the grounding line is not high enough to\nallow the first shelf grid point to become grounded (or the\nlast grounded grid point to float). The grounding line is\ntherefore unable to change and is tied to its initial position.\nFigure 7. Total grounding line change after reaching a\nsteady state calculated with the FGSHSF model shown\nagainst horizontal grid size for the different labeled\nperturbation experiments.\nF01003 VIELI AND PAYNE: MODELING GROUNDING LINE MIGRATION\n7 of 18\nF01003\n[42] For the MGSH model we also observe a dependency\nof grounding line change on the chosen horizontal grid size\n(Figure 8), however, the dependency is weak and signifi-\ncantly smaller than the grid size and therefore within the\naccuracy of the model. Furthermore, the change in ground-\ning line position decreases with decreasing grid size.\n[43] All experiments were repeated with varying time\nsteps between 5.0 and 0.1 years. For both models, the\ncalculated response was the same once the time step was\nsmall enough to be stable for the current grid size (Courant\ncondition [Press et al., 1992, p. 829]).\n3.3. Summary of the EISMINT Experiments\n[44] In case of the FGSHSF model, grounding line\nchanges (where a change occurs) are in the order of several\ngrid points (5\u201310 km) and a tendency to advance rather\nthan retreat is observed. Furthermore, the perturbation\nexperiments are found to be irreversible. This hysteresis\nof the grounding line position, the magnitude of grounding\nline change and the tendency to advance are consistent with\nthe results of the fixed grid models of the EISMINT\ncomparison study [Huybrechts, 1997]. This supports our\ncontention that the FGSHSF model is representative of the\ncurrent generation of fixed grid ice sheet models.\n[45] A new result from our model experiments is that the\ndynamics of the grounding line resulting from the FGSHSF\nmodel is strongly affected by the ice rheology (i.e., assumed\nice temperature) and by the chosen horizontal grid size. The\nlatter is crucial, because it implies that the predictions of\nfixed grid models for the evolution of marine ice sheets are\nnot independent of the models\u2019 numerics. In the EISMINT\ncomparison study the dependency on numerics or rheology\nwas not investigated.\n[46] The results from the MGSHXX model are qualita-\ntively very different. For any external forcing, the ground-\ning line changes and finds a new steady state position, but\nthe amount of change is in general small (<2 km) and no\npreference for an advance or retreat is observed. Further-\nmore, all experiments are reversible. The stable behavior is\na characteristic dynamical features of a marine ice sheet\nwith the property of neutral equilibrium. No qualitative\ndependency of ice sheet dynamics on ice rheology was\nobserved and the observed small dependency on horizontal\ngrid size is within the accuracy of the numerical model. The\nchief conclusion from this section is therefore that moving\ngrid models appear to be more robust than fixed grid\nmodels, and that the predictions of the latter show strong\ndependency on numerical details.\n4. Ice Sheet Experiments\n[47] The experiments described above are not represen-\ntative of the true dimensions and parameter values of a\nmarine ice sheet, therefore we perform a series of model\nexperiments for a more realistic model setting, representing\nthe dimensions of the WAIS. The half width of the\ngrounded part is set to 750 km and the shelf length to\n250 km. The whole domain has 81 horizontal grid points, of\nwhich initially 61 points are grounded (corresponding to\nDx = 12.5 km). The initial water depth at the terminus is\n500 m. To investigate the effect of basal topography, three\ndifferent slopes of \u00020.0006\u0005, 0.0\u0005, and +0.0006\u0005 are chosen\nfor the bedrock topography (see Figure 9). The rate factor of\nA = 1.4 \u0007 10\u000217 Pa\u00023 a\u00021 (corresponding to \u000210\u0005C) is\nused, a value often used for modeling ice sheets [Paterson,\n1994, p. 97]). An initial accumulation rate of 0.2 m a\u00021 is\nused here. We will explicitly note when different parameters\nor geometries are used.\n[48] The model experiments are similar to those per-\nformed for EISMINT. In a first phase initial steady states\nare calculated for the parameter setting described above.\nUsing these steady states as initial geometries, the response\nof the marine ice sheet to step changes in accumulation to\n0.1 m a\u00021 and 1.0 m a\u00021, and gradual changes of sea level\nto \u00b1125 m over a period of 10 ka years are calculated.\nOccasionally, a shorter period of 1 ka has been chosen\nfor the sea level change experiments to reduce computa-\ntion time, however, the results for these cases are qual-\nitatively very similar although the timing is different. The\nresults for the ice sheet experiments are summarized in\nFigures 10\u201315.\n4.1. MGSHXX Model\n[49] In general, the results of the MGSHXX model are\nqualitatively the same as those from the EISMINT experi-\nFigure 8.

For any forcing in accumulation rate or sea level, the\ngrounding line changes and finds a new steady state\nposition (Figure 10). Again, the amount of grounding line\nchange is small relative to the ice sheet length (below 1%\n(Table 2)). As expected, the relative thickness change is\nmore pronounced in the accumulation change experiment,\nwhile in the sea level change experiment the surface\ngeometry remains almost constant (Table 2). After switch-\ning back the external forcing to its initial value, the ice sheet\ngoes back to its initial state, which means the perturbation\nexperiments are reversible. These findings are independent\nof the basal topography chosen (Figure 10) as previously\ndemonstrated in detail by LeMeur and Hindmarsh [2001].\nAlso, the amount of grounding line change is almost\nindependent of the basal topography (Table 2). Results for\nthe same experiments with the MGSHSF model, that\ncouples an ice sheet to the shelf through the flux at the\ngrounding line (grounding line is on staggered grid), are\nquantitatively and qualitatively very similar to the results\nfrom the MGSHXX model.\n4.2. FGSHSF Model\n[50] For the FGSHSF model, a reduction in accumulation\nto 0.1 m a\u00021 or an increase in sea level to 125 m leads to a\nsignificant retreat of the grounding line position (Figure 11).\nIn contrast, even a large increase in accumulation to 2.0 m\na\u00021 or a sea level lowering to \u0002250 m does not cause an\nadvance. This is in contrast to the preference for advance\nfound in the EISMINT experiments. The reason for this is\nmainly related to the choice of the rate factor within the\nshelf and is discussed later. For a flat bed, we found that the\nretreat caused by a reduction in accumulation or an increase\nin sea level is unstable, and the ice sheet eventually vanishes\n(Figure 11). Such an unstable response is also obtained for\nthe case of a bed that slopes upward in the direction of flow\n(as is the case for the WAIS) and the rates of retreat are even\nhigher. In contrast, a down sloping bed leads to a stable\nFigure 10. Response of the grounding line to different\nperturbation experiments calculated with the MGSHXX\nmodel.

Sensitivity to Rate Factor\n[52] The preference for retreat over advance in the\nFGSHSF model (Figure 11) is expected to be mainly a\nconsequence of the higher rate factor employed in this set of\nexperiments. This was already indicated in the EISMINT\nexperiment when repeated with a higher rate factor. In the\nice shelf, a higher rate factor corresponds to a lower\neffective viscosity and leads to enhanced longitudinal ex-\ntension rates, and therefore to a generally thinner ice shelf\nand a stronger thickness gradient immediately down glacier\nof the grounding line (Figure 12). As a consequence, for the\nfirst grid point downstream from the grounding line to\nbecome grounded and the grounding line to advance, a\nmuch larger change in flux is needed. Experiments with a\nrate factor corresponding to \u000210\u0005C in the sheet and \u000230\u0005C\nin the shelf show that an advance is now obtained for an\nincrease in accumulation to 1.0 m a\u00021 (Figure 13). An even\nfaster advance is obtained when a rate factor corresponding\nto \u000230\u0005C is used for the whole domain. On the other hand,\nretreat cannot now be generated even for a decrease in\naccumulation to 0.01 m a\u00021. In contrast, MSSHXX model\nexperiments with a higher rate factor did not significantly\nchange the response of the grounding line.\n[53] This type of rate factor dependency in the FGSHSF\nmodel also occurs for the sea level increase experiment, and\nimplies that in a fixed grid model the choice of the rate\nfactor and therefore the temperature within the shelf\nTable 2.

All experiments are for a flat ice sheet base.\nF01003 VIELI AND PAYNE: MODELING GROUNDING LINE MIGRATION\n10 of 18\nF01003\nstrongly affects qualitative predictions of grounding line\nmigration. Using a model which includes mechanical cou-\npling at the grounding line,Huybrechts and De Wolde [1999]\nand Huybrechts [2002] similarly found that the evolution of\nthe Antarctic ice sheet was sensitive to the treatment of\ntemperature within the ice shelf. Here we show that such a\nshelf temperature sensitivity is independent of any mechan-\nical coupling between the grounded and floating ice.\n[54] We also found that a lower rate factor in the shelf\ndoes not affect the qualitative dependency of grounding line\nchange on basal topography (Figure 13). All experiments\nwith this model exhibited an unstable advance for the case\nof a flat or up sloping bed, and a stable advance toward a\nsteady state for the case of a down sloping bed.\n4.2.2. Effect of Lateral Drag in the FGSHSF Model\n[55] The shelf in the FGSHSF model spreads freely in the\ndirection of flow, thus no resistance from the sides is\nconsidered. Most real ice shelves are confined to the sides\nand therefore encounter resistive forces. Although in the\ncase of large ice shelves these back stresses are expected to\nbe small, they may have a stabilizing effect on the ground-\ning line migration. Therefore some model experiments are\nrepeated with a model that accounts in a simple way for\nlateral stress gradients by adding a term in the stress balance\n(equation (4)) which is linearly related to the horizontal flow\nvelocity and ice thickness [Van der Veen and Whillans,\n1996]:\ng \n u x\u00f0 \u00deh x\u00f0 \u00de; \u00f012\u00de\nwhere g controls the resistance from the sides and is set to\ng = 2 \u0007 104 Pa s m\u00022, a value that corresponds to an ice\nshelf width of roughly 1000 km and is appropriate to the\nRoss or Ronne-Filchner ice shelves. The effect of lateral\ndrag on the shelf geometry and grounding line migration is\nillustrated in the Figures 12 and 14. In contrast to the case\nwithout lateral drag, an advance is now obtained for a\nchange of accumulation to 1.0 m a\u00021 with a flat bed, and\nfurthermore the advance is now stable. For a decrease in\naccumulation or increase in sea level, the retreat is slower in\nthe case of a flat bed, however the retreat still appears to be\nunstable. Thus the inclusion of lateral drag seems to have a\nstabilizing effect on grounding line motion and may also\nweaken the preference for retreat over advance. Hence in a\nthree-dimensional version of a fixed grid marine ice sheet\nmodel (which implicitly includes flow resistance from the\nside), the observed instability for a flat or up sloping base,\nas well as the tendencies for retreat or advance, are all\nexpected to be reduced. Because the MGSHXX model does\nnot consider a shelf the effect of lateral drag within the shelf\nwas not investigated.\n4.3. Sensitivity to Horizontal Grid Size\n[56] As already seen in the EISMINT experiments, the\nresults from the FGSHSF model in this configuration\nstrongly depend on the grid size. For a step change in\naccumulation to 0.1 m a\u00021, a grid size of 8.33 km (121 grid\npoints) instead of 12.5 km (81 grid points) leads to a slower\nretreat for a flat bed (Figure 15). As for the sea level\nincrease experiment to +125 m, the advance slows for a\nsmaller grid sizes. For a down sloping bed, the retreat rates\nand the total retreat of the grounding line decrease with\ndecreasing grid size. Including lateral drag in the shelf (see\nabove) did not remove the grid-size dependency of the\nFGSHSF model. In contrast, as in the EISMINT experi-\nments, the MGSHXX model is only slightly dependent on\nthe grid size and this dependency is within the resolution of\nthe model (Table 3).\n4.4. Summary of Ice Sheet Experiments\n[57] The qualitative dynamics of both models with a\ndown sloping bed is the same as in the EISMINT case.\nThe one exception is that there is tendency for retreat in the\nFGSHSF model rather than advance, which is a result of\nthe higher rate factor employed in these experiments. The\nstrong dependency on ice rheology in fixed grid models\nimplies that an accurate computation of temperature within\nthe shelf and in the grounding line region is needed for the\naccurate modeling of grounding line migration.\n[58] The experiments for different basal slopes show that\nthe results from the MGSHXX model are qualitatively\nunaffected by the slope of the bed, whereas dynamics of\nthe grounding line in the FGSHSF model strongly depend\non basal topography. For a down sloping bed, a change in\nsea level or accumulation leads to a stable advance or retreat\nthat reaches a new steady state, however for a flat or up\nsloping bed (which has not been considered in the\nEISMINT study [Huybrechts, 1997]), we observe an accel-\nerated, unstable advance or retreat. This would imply that in\nthe case of the WAIS, once the grounding line starts to\nretreat, it would not stop until it reaches a down sloping bed.\nSimilarly, once the grounding line starts to advance, it\nwould not stop until it reaches the outer edge of the\ncontinental shelf (where it would encounter much deeper\nwater). The observed instability also indicates that this\nmodel does not exhibit stable neutral equilibria. The incor-\nporation of lateral drag within the shelf is observed to\nweaken the instability, but it does not seem to remove it.\nWhether such an instability can occur in reality has not yet\nbeen shown from field observations and is difficult to prove\ntheoretically. It should be stressed here that only the fixed\nTable 3.

Ice Stream Experiments\n[60] In this section, we investigate the influence on\ngrounding line migration of mechanical coupling between\nthe grounded ice and the shelf. For the grounded component\nwe use the ice stream model, and we attached it to an ice\nshelf. Again a fixed grid model (named FGSTSF) and a\nmoving grid model (named MGSTSF) are used (Table 1).\nBoth models consider momentum coupling (mechanical\ncoupling) over the grounding line. The equations for ice\nstream flow (equation (6)) and ice shelf flow (equation (4))\nare solved simultaneously for both models by iterating for\nthe effective viscosity given by equation (5) and using\ncentered differences at the grounding line. Besides the\nmomentum velocity calculation within the grounded part,\nthe FGSTSF model is identical to the FGSHSF model, thus\ncentered differences are used for the thickness evolution\nequation at the grounding line. In contrast, for the MGSTSF\nmodel asymmetric differences are used for the thickness\nevolution equation at the grounding line, allowing a dis-\ncontinuity in surface slope. The details for the MGSTSF\nmodel are given in section 2.2.2.2 and in Appendices A\nand B.\n[61] A basal resistance coefficient of b2 = 1.0 \u0007\n109 Pa s m\u00021 is used and the initial lengths of the ice\nstream and the shelf are set to 750 km and 250 km\nrespectively. Again, the rate factor used corresponds to\n\u000210\u0005C and the initial accumulation rate is set to 0.2 m a\u00021.\n5.1. Steady State Calculations\n[62] In contrast to the ice sheet, no analytical or numerical\ninitial steady state solution for the ice stream part is\navailable. We calculate for both models an approximate\ninitial steady state by neglecting the longitudinal stress\nterms in the ice stream equation (6). Using this solution\nthe models are run forward in time until a steady state is\nreached (typically after 5 ka). For the FGSTSF model, the\nsteady state grounding line position is usually identical to its\ninitial location at 750 km, whereas for the MGSTSF model\nthe grounding line has advanced slightly. Note that the\nelevation at the ice divide is now lower (1400 m) than in the\nice sheet case (4500 m) as expected for an ice stream\n(Figure 9). For some parameter settings, such as smaller\ndimensions or a smaller b2, no initial steady state could be\nfound for the MGSTSF model.\n5.2. Perturbation Experiments\n[63] The perturbation experiments used with the ice sheet\nare now repeated with the ice stream\/shelf models (FGSTSF\nand MGSTSF). In most aspects the results for both models\nare qualitatively similar to the ice sheet\/shelf case.\n5.2.1. FGSTSF Model\n[64] In contrast to the ice sheet case, the FGSTSF model\nhas a strong tendency to advance (Figure 16) and no retreat\nof the grounding line was obtained for a reduction of the\naccumulation rate to 0.1 m a\u00021 or an increase in sea level to\n+125 m. Only a massive reduction of accumulation to\n0.01 m a\u00021 leads to a retreat, although it does not start\nuntil 25 ka after the step change. However, in all other\naspects, the results are qualitatively similar to the ones from\nthe FGSHSF model. A dependency of the grounding line\nmigration on the sign of the basal slope is observed and for\na flat or up sloping bed we get an unstable advance\n(Figure 16). In addition, the grounding line change strongly\ndepends on the horizontal grid size and after switching back\nthe external forcing to the initial value the grounding line\ndoes not go back to its initial value. Including lateral drag as\nbefore in the FGSHSF model (g = 2 \u0007 104 Pa s m\u00022)\nproduces similar qualitative behavior of the grounding line,\nhowever if a change does occur it is both faster and larger\n(Figure 16). The comments above also apply to the results\nof the sea level change experiments (\u00b1125 m over 10 ka).\n5.2.2. MGSTSF Model\n[65] The response of the MGSTSF model, shown in\nFigure 17 for the accumulation change experiment only, is\nqualitatively similar to the MGSHXX model, although the\nmagnitude of grounding line change (for the same external\nforcing) is about a factor of five larger than for the\nMGSHXX model. This higher sensitivity of ice streams to\nchanges in the external forcing is expected to be a result of a\nlower surface slope behind the grounding line.\nThe MGSTSF model is also insensitive to basal slope\n(Table 4); the grid size dependency is weak and within\nthe accuracy of the model; the experiments are in general\nreversible; and importantly, the MGSTSF model shows a\nstable behavior. Thus the coupled stream shelf model\n(MGSTSF) shows qualitatively the same dynamics as the\nMGSHXX model. The analogous dynamics of the\nFigure 16. Response of the grounding line calculated with\nthe FGSTSF model to a change in accumulation to 1.0 m\na\u00021 (triangles) and 0.1 m a\u00021 (circles) for a flat base (solid\nlines), an up sloping base (dotted lines), and a down sloping\nbase (dashed lines). For the accumulation change experi-\nment to 1.0 m a\u00021 the grounding position is also shown for\nthe case of a switch back of the accumulation after 5 ka to\nthe initial value. The small triangles refer to the accumula-\ntion change experiment to 1.0 m a\u00021 with a flat base but a\nsmaller horizontal grid size of 6.25 km instead of 12.5 km,\nas before. The stars show the accumulation change\nexperiment to 1.0 m a\u00021 considering lateral drag.\nF01003 VIELI AND PAYNE: MODELING GROUNDING LINE MIGRATION\n12 of 18\nF01003\nMGSTSF model does not necessarily mean that mechanical\ncoupling at the grounding line can be ignored. However, it\nseems that the discretization and grounding line treatment\n(moving grid) of the MGSTSF model, which are essentially\nthe same as in the MGSHXX model, dominantly determine\nthe dynamics of the grounding line and therefore\npreserve the stable dynamical behavior from the MGSHXX\nmodel and possibly the condition of stable neutral equilib-\nrium. Whether a marine ice sheet which is mechanically\ncoupled to its ice shelf should \u2018\u2018theoretically\u2019\u2019 have neutral\nequilibrium is not known.\n5.2.2.1. Unstable Retreat\n[66] The one case, in which the results of the MGSTSF\nmodel are distinctly different from the MGSHXX model, is\nfor a \u2018\u2018strong\u2019\u2019 retreat. A decrease of the accumulation rate\nto 0.01 m a\u00021 (or lower) results in an unstable retreat of the\ngrounding line for the MGSTSF model and the ice stream\nvanishes (Figure 17). An unstable retreat is also obtained\nwhen the value of the friction coefficient b2 is reduced\nbelow 1.0 \u0007 109 Pa s m\u00021. For these \u2018\u2018strong\u2019\u2019 retreats, after\nswitching back a or b2 at 5 ka or 10 ka to the initial value,\nthe grounding line approaches a steady state, however, this\nsteady state position is not the same as the initial grounding\nline position (Figure 17). This indicates that these \u2018\u2018ex-\ntreme\u2019\u2019 experiments are irreversible. No instability was\nobtained for any advance or any sea level rise or lowering\nexperiment. The experiment for a decrease of the accumu-\nlation rate to 0.01 m a\u00021 was repeated for the two ice sheet\nmodels (MGSHXX and MGSHSF) using a much higher\nrate factor of A = 1.0 \u000710\u000214 Pa\u00023 a\u00021 to simulate an ice\nsheet with approximately the same initial geometry as the\nice stream from the MGSTSF model. No unstable retreat\nwas obtained for this setup, implying that it is not just the\nice sheet shape or the lower surface slope that leads to the\nobserved instability. The same experiment has also been\nrepeated with the MGSTSF model but neglecting the\nlongitudinal stress gradients within the grounded part of\nthe stream, meaning that the driving stress is balanced by\nb2u alone (equation (6)). Again, no unstable retreat was\nobtained. A further experiment with a modified MGSTSF\nmodel that considers longitudinal stress gradients up to one\ngrid point behind the grounding line, and therefore only\nallows mechanical coupling between shelf and sheet around\nthe grounding line, leads to similar unstable behavior as\nobserved for the full MGSTSF model. The additional model\nexperiments therefore indicate that the retreat instability is\nnot solely a result of the discretization scheme, and ground-\ning line treatment (moving grid) alone, but may be associ-\nated with the longitudinal coupling. In case of very low\nfriction coefficients, longitudinal coupling is more effective\nand one could argue that the ice stream almost becomes an\nice shelf [Pattyn, 2003] and the \u2018\u2018real\u2019\u2019 grounding line\nwould then be located at the contact between ice sheet\nand stream. In our case the stream extends up to the divide\nand we do not include a sheet which could act as an anchor.\nTherefore the observed instability for low basal frictions\nmay be due to the fact that the stream becomes an ice shelf\n(extremely low aspect ratio of the stream).\n5.2.2.2. Sensitivity to Lateral Drag\n[67] Including lateral drag in the floating and grounded\npart of the MGSTSF model as before in the fixed grid\nmodels (g = 2 \u0007 104 Pa s m\u00022 (equation (12)) does not\nchange the qualitative response of the grounding line to the\napplied external forcing. Furthermore, the amount of\ngrounding line change is almost identical to the case without\nconsideration of lateral drag. This result contrasts the\nobserved significant influence of lateral drag in the fixed\ngrid model (Figure 16).\n5.2.2.3. Sensitivity to Discretization\n[68] Because no shelf is considered in the MGSHXX\nmodel the horizontal gradients in the grounding line migra-\ntion equation (10) are discretized by upstream differences.\nUpstream differences are also used in the MGSTSF model,\nhowever, considering a shelf, we now have the possibility of\nusing central differences to discretize these gradients.\nTherefore additional MGSTSF model runs have been per-\nformed in which centered differences are used for the flux\ndivergence and thickness gradient in equation (10) instead\nof upstream differences. The steady state geometry from the\nupstream case is used as an initial condition. In the\nFigure 17. Response of the grounding line calculated with\nthe MGSTSF model to a change in accumulation to 0.1 m\na\u00021 (circles), to 1.0 m a\u00021 (triangles), and to 0.01 m a\u00021\n(squares). The dotted lines refer to the same forcing, but\nhere the accumulation rate is set back to the initial value at\n5 ka or 10 ka, respectively. The dashed line refers to a\nsmaller initial grid size of 6.25 km instead of 12.5 km for a\nchange in accumulation to 0.1 m a\u00021.\nTable 4.

For an accumulation step\nchange experiment, we also obtain an unstable retreat or\nadvance using centered differences in equation (10). A close\nexamination shows that it is the centered discretization\n(instead of upstream) of the flux gradient (@q\/@x) in\nequation (10) that leads to the observed instability not the\ncentered discretization of the thickness gradient (@h\/@x).\nThe same sensitivity of the grounding line change to a\ncentered discretization (instead of upstream) of equation (10)\nis found for the MGSHSF model suggesting that the\ninstability is independent of the mechanical coupling at\nthe grounding line. This sensitivity analysis indicates that\nthe way we discretize the grounding line migration equation\nin a moving grid model strongly affects the dynamics of the\nmarine ice sheet. One therefore has to be careful with\npredictions of such moving grid models.\n5.3. Summary of Ice Stream Experiments\n[69] For both the MGSTSF and the FGSTSF models, the\nresults are qualitatively similar to the two ice sheet models.\nThis implies that the way in which the mechanical coupling\nbetween the grounded and the floating ice is incorporated\ninto the models does not affect their qualitative behavior.\nEven the consideration of lateral drag throughout the\ndomain, which allows shelf buttressing, did not alter these\nresults. However, we should note that this insensitivity to\nlongitudinal coupling is only tested here in cases where\nlateral resistance is low and there are no dramatic changes in\nice shelf buttressing.\n[70] There are two main differences compared to the\ndynamics of the sheet models. First, the FGSTSF model\nshows an advancing tendency independent of the particular\nrate factor chosen. Second, the \u2018\u2018extreme\u2019\u2019 retreat scenarios\nlead for the case of the MGSTSH model to an unstable\nretreat. The FGSTSF model still shows a strong dependency\non grid size and basal topography. The insensitivity of the\ntwo models to the mechanical coupling at the grounding\nline suggests that it is the numerics and the way in which\ngrounding line migration is treated in the models that\ndominates their qualitative dynamics.\n6. Concluding Discussion\n[71] Several previous modeling studies have concentrated\non the migration of the grounding line of a marine ice sheet\nsuch as the WAIS. The present study presents an extensive\ncomparison of the different numerical methods used to\nsimulate grounding line migration and investigates the\nsensitivity of their predictions to model numerics. We have\nselected models that reflect the basic classes of model that\nhave been applied to this problem. The range of models that\nwe have tested can be classified into two ways. First, by the\nphysics that they contain. This range includes models that\ncombine sheet (vertical shear dominated) and shelf (plug)\nflow, stream (plug) and shelf flow, and sheet flow alone.\nSecond, by the way in which the underlying differential\nequations are discretized. We are primarily concerned with\nthe differences between fixed and moving grids, although\nwe have also investigated the effects of discretization details\nnear the grounding line. We believe that the fixed grid\nmodels are representative of the models typically used to\nsimulate the past and future behavior of the Antarctic ice\nsheet [e.g., Ritz et al., 2001; Huybrechts, 2002; Huybrechts\nand De Wolde, 1999]. We have also investigated the effect\nof numerical details (such as grid size and time step) on\nmodel behavior. We use this as a test of the robustness of a\nnumerical model and expect that a robust model will exhibit\nbehavior that is independent of numerical detail. The\npredictions of models that show excessive dependence on\nnumerics should therefore be treated with some suspicion.\n[72] This study clearly shows that from these models no\nconsensus is reached in how the grounding line should react\nto changes in boundary conditions such as changes in sea\nlevel or the accumulation rate.\n[73] In the case of the moving grid models, the changes in\ngrounding line are in general small, a new steady state is\nalways reached (stable system) and the perturbation experi-\nments are reversible. An important result is that the ground-\ning line dynamics are insensitive to basal slope, which\ntherefore questions earlier suggestions of the inherent insta-\nbility of a marine ice sheet on an up sloping bed [Weertman,\n1974; Thomas and Bentley, 1978]. Although the moving\ngrid model is numerically self consistent (shows the condi-\ntion of neutral equilibrium), grounding line motion is rather\nsensitive to details of the discretization around the ground-\ning line and it is not clear whether the way the model is\nsetup implicitly biases (controls) the grounding line dynam-\nics. Nonetheless, it can be concluded that this type of model\nappears to be robust according to our criterion.\n[74] The results of the fixed grid model are consistent\nwith the earlier EISMINT results using similar fixed grid\nmodels [Huybrechts, 1997] but are in clear contrast to the\nresults of the moving grid models. The fixed grid models\nshow larger changes in grounding line position (in the cases\nwhere a change occurs) and the changes are irreversible.\nDepending on the chosen temperature within the ice, a\npreference for advance or retreat is observed, which implies\nthat an accurate computation of temperature within the shelf\nand in the grounding line region is needed for accurate\nmodeling of grounding line migration. Furthermore, the\ngrounding line motion is unstable on a flat or up sloping\nbed, meaning that the stability of a marine ice sheet\nstrongly depends on the basal slope and\/or changes in the\ncross sectional area. This finding contrasts the stable\nbehavior of the moving grid model and is, of course,\nimportant for the dynamics of marine ice sheets such as\nthe WAIS, and supports several early theories predicting\ninstability [Weertman, 1974].\n[75] The crucial finding of this study is the strong\ndependency of the fixed grid model on its numerical details\nsuch as the horizontal grid size around the grounding line.\nThis type of model is certainly not robust by our definition.\nThis implies that we should be very careful when interpret-\ning the grounding line predictions from the existing fixed\ngrid marine models, which have been used for several\nreconstructions of the past evolution of Antarctica [Ritz et\nal., 2001; Huybrechts, 2002; Huybrechts and De Wolde,\n1999; Huybrechts, 1990].\n[76] For both methods of treating grounding line migra-\ntion, the incorporation of mechanical coupling over the\ngrounding line does not change the qualitative behavior of\ngrounding line motion. This finding also holds when lateral\nF01003 VIELI AND PAYNE: MODELING GROUNDING LINE MIGRATION\n14 of 18\nF01003\ndrag is incorporated in the shelf (shelf buttressing). The\ndynamics of the grounding line are dominantly controlled\nby the way the grounding line motion is treated and the\ndiscretization scheme used, and the physics incorporated\ninto a particular model appears to have only secondary\nimportance (in particular, the longitudinal momentum cou-\npling between the ice shelf and the grounded ice sheet).\nThus it is difficult to assess the importance of longitudinal\ncoupling until a reliable numerical method of treating\ngrounding line motion has been established.\n[77] The somewhat peculiar grounding line dynamics and\nthe strong grid size dependency observed for the fixed grid\nmodel (as opposed to the moving grid model) seems mainly\nto be a result of having a fixed grid. We therefore doubt\nwhether a fixed grid grounding line motion model can ever\nbe satisfactory. This would favor the use of a moving grid\ncoordinate system that allows the grounding line to be\ntracked continuously. However, implementing such a\nstretched grid in a three-dimensional ice sheet model is a\nvery major task. A useful compromise for further develop-\nment may therefore be a locally adaptive grid. Such a grid\nwould maintain the basic structure of the fixed grid over the\nlarge domain of the ice sheet but track the position of the\ngrounding line by local deformation of the overall grid.\nAlthough the work here was performed using finite differ-\nence models, we expect the same issue of fixed versus\nmoving grid would affect finite element models, although\nthey are better suited to resolve irregular geometries.\n[78] We finally conclude that this model comparison study\ncan not conclusively identify a reliable method of treating\ngrounding line migration within numerical ice sheet models.\nIt also demonstrates an urgent need of further development in\norder to be able tomake accurate predictions for the evolution\nof the WAIS. In particular, the modeling community should\nfind a method of employing a moving grid in two-dimen-\nsional plane ice flow models. The experiments performed\nhere could represent a basis for \u2018model intercomparison\nbenchmarks\u2019 for models with a moving grounding line.\nFurther model development also requires a better observa-\ntional history of grounding line migration (in terms of both\nthe timing and spatial extent) and also indicates the need of a\ntest data set for the modeling community.\nAppendix A: Coordinate Transformations\nA1.

MGSTSF Model\n[83] As in the MGSHXX model the flux q is calculated\non a staggered grid in between the grid points where the\nthickness and surface evolution is calculated. The main\ndifference is now that the position of the grounding line\nLg is located on the staggered grid (Figure B1). The\nreason for this is to ensure continuity of mass over the\ngrounding line. The additional version of a sheet model\nwith a shelf (noted as MGSHSF) uses the same discre-\ntization scheme.\nFigure B1. Schematic of the discretization around the\ngrounding line for the MGSTSF model and the MGSHSF\nmodel.
