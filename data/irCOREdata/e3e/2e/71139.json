Earthward injections of energetic ions and elec-\ntrons mark the onset of magnetospheric substorms. In the in-\nner magnetosphere (L\u223c4), the energetic ions drift westward\nand the electrons eastward, thereby enhancing the equatorial\nring current.

The ions are injected\nslightly closer to Earth in the pre-midnight sector, leading\nto the formation of a radial polarisation field in the inner\nmagnetosphere. This maps to a poleward electric field just\nequatorward of the auroral oval in the ionosphere.

Ionosphere (Auroral ionosphere; Electric fields\nand currents; Ionosphere-magnetosphere interactions) \u2013\nMagnetospheric physics (Storms and substorms)\n1 Introduction\nBursty reconnection (Russell and Elphic, 1978; Haerendel et\nal., 1978) of solar and terrestrial magnetic fields is thought\nto drive the flow of plasma across the open-closed magnetic\nfield-line boundary (OCB) in the high-latitude ionosphere\n(Cowley and Lockwood, 1992). Due to the incompressibility\nof the ionosphere, the flow bursts generate a characteristic\ncirculation pattern which extends across the polar cap and\nauroral oval. The convection reversal boundary (CRB) is ap-\nproximately aligned with the OCB. Here we will refer to the\nflow reversal boundary (FRB) which represents an equator-\nward limit to the reconnection driven circulation, and marks\nthe transition to approximately corotational flows of the mid-\nlatitude ionosphere (Huang et al., 2001). Although reconnec-\ntion driven circulation can penetrate across the FRB, is there\nsome other fundamental driver of magnetospheric circulation\nmapping to the auroral and sub-auroral ionosphere?\nPolarisation Jets (PJs) (Galperin et al., 1973) are nar-\nrow channels (<1 to 2\u25e63) of intense westward plasma flow\n(\u223c1 km s\u22121 to >4 km s\u22121) which occur just equatorward of,\nor overlapping, the equatorward edge of the auroral oval.\n1372 M. L. Parkinson: Interhemispheric asymmetries\nTheir peak occurrence is in the evening sector near 22 h mag-\nnetic local time (MLT) (Karlsson et al., 1998). They are also\nknown as sub-auroral ion drift events (SAIDs) (Spiro et al.,\n1979) and sub-auroral electric fields (SAEFs) (Karlsson et\nal., 1998). Important satellite (Smiddy et al., 1977; Rich\net al., 1980; Anderson et al., 1991, 1993, 2001) and radar\n(Galperin et al., 1986; Providakes et al., 1989; Yeh et al.,\n1991) observations have been reported. Substorm-associated\nradar auroral surges (SARAS) (Freeman et al., 1992; Shand\net al., 1998) and auroral westward flow channels (AWFCs)\n(Parkinson et al., 2003) are probably different aspects of the\nsame underlying phenomenon.\nRecently, a more encompassing term, the \u201csubauroral po-\nlarisation stream\u201d (SAPS) (Foster and Burke, 2002), has been\nproposed. This term is so useful because it helps to describe\nthe weaker background westward flows (\u223c100 to 400 m s\u22121)\npersisting beyond midnight, and during quieter conditions,\nwhich help to define the FRB. PJ\/SAIDs can be thought of as\nenhanced SAPS flows or as discrete events within the SAPS.\nPerhaps PJ\/SAIDs ultimately drive the SAPS and the equa-\ntorward limit of the return sunward flow within the evening\nconvection cell, as well as structure within that flow.\nA qualitative theory of PJ\/SAID formation and evolution\nhas emerged from observations (i.e. above) and theoretical\nconsiderations (Southward, 1977, 1978; De Keyser et al.,\n1998; De Keyser, 1999; Galperin, 2002). Basically, dur-\ning magnetospheric storms and near to the onset of sub-\nstorms, an \u201cinjection front\u201d of energetic ions and electrons\nforms in the magnetotail and migrates Earthward toward ring\ncurrent\/radiation belt L shells (\u223c4 to 5). Substorm physics\nand the associated Earthward injections are thought to result\nfrom an explosion of magnetic reconnection near \u223c25RE in\nthe late growth phase (Baker et al., 1999), or an instability-\ntriggered reconfiguration of the inner magnetosphere in the\ncurrent disruption model (Lui, 2001), or both.\nEnergetic ions and electrons within the injection front are\ndriven Earthward by an enhanced cross-tail electric field.\nIons subsequently drift westward and electrons eastward un-\nder the influence of gradient and curvature drifts, thereby\ncontributing to the familiar ring current. The trajectory of the\nions extend closer to Earth than the electrons pre-midnight\n(and vice versa post-midnight). This seeds the initial forma-\ntion of a weak space-charge separation; thus radial polarisa-\ntion fields develop in the inner magnetosphere.\nThe high-latitude ionosphere may play a crucial role in the\nevolution of magnetospheric features. Because the Earth\u2019s\nmagnetic field lines are approximately equi-potentials, an\ninitial, weak radial polarisation field in the magnetosphere\nwill map to a poleward directed electric field in the iono-\nsphere of both hemispheres. Electric fields are thought to\navoid regions of large height-integrated Pedersen conduc-\ntivity (6p), but they are focussed into regions of low 6p\n(e.g. Milan et al., 1999). This must occur because Pedersen\ncurrents would otherwise lead to the accumulation of space\ncharge at the boundaries between low and high 6p.\nIn the case of PJ\/SAIDs, the poleward directed electric\nfield maps to the main ionospheric trough, a region of rel-\natively low 6p. Application of E=\u2212v\u00d7B implies a rapid,\nwestward flow of plasma within the plasma trough. Ion-\nneutral frictional heating is then thought to further reduce\nthe plasma density, which also reduces 6p, which in turn\nleads to an amplification of the initial polarisation field\n(Jp=6pE). Thus a run-away effect may lead to an inten-\nsification of the magnetospheric field, resulting in some very\nlarge ionospheric westward drifts (>4 km s\u22121). Of course,\nthis model assumes a steady magnetospheric current source\nwhich is strictly not true given the finite lifetime of PJ\/SAIDs\n(\u223c1 to 3 h).\nIn the preceding description of coupled feedback, we do\nnot mean to imply that PJ\/SAIDs are driven by the magne-\ntosphere, or that polarisation fields in the magnetosphere are\ndriven by the ionosphere. Rather, both act in unison. For\nexample, the presence of a pre-existing ionospheric trough\nmight amplify a magnetospheric perturbation which would\notherwise stabilise. Conversely, an ionospheric perturbation\nmight not develop without an initial magnetospheric pertur-\nbation. The temporal history of all the substorm elements is\nstill an open question.\nMore detailed modelling and theory, combined with more\ncomprehensive observations, are required. For example, the\npreference for PJ\/SAIDs to occur pre-midnight is thought\nto arise from the opposing effect of a relatively weak co-\nrotation field (De Keyser et al., 1998). It is also uncertain\nhow the field-aligned current sheets at the equatorward (J\ndownward) and poleward (J upward) edges of PJ\/SAIDs are\ndriven and sustained. Richard Horne (Private Communica-\ntion) is working on a substorm model of wave-particle in-\nteractions which may scatter a sufficient number of charge\ncarriers into the loss cone to account for the required current\ndensities (\u223c1 \u00b5A m\u22122).\nParkinson et al. (2003) reported radar observations of a\nsingle AWFC. The characteristics of this event were simi-\nlar to those of PJ\/SAIDs, except it grew and decayed with\nthe onset and recovery of a moderate substorm, respectively.\nBurke et al. (2000) also reported a PJ\/SAID during the ex-\npansion phase of a geomagnetic substorm. This contrasts\nwith previous satellite observations reporting the exclusive\noccurrence of PJ\/SAIDs during substorm recovery phase\n(Anderson et al. 1993; Karlsson et al., 1998).\nObservations reported by Parkinson et al. (2003) were\nalso noteworthy because they showed the AWFC was the\nprimary signature of the substorm in terms of the strength\nof ionospheric and magnetospheric electric fields. This con-\ntrasts with ground-based magnetometer observations which\nrespond to ionospheric Hall currents at high latitudes. These\nobservations have long shown the ionospheric substorm is\nlocated further poleward in the highly conducting discrete\nauroral oval. Recent radar observations have also revealed\nthe suppression of substorm electric fields in the auroral oval\n(Provan et al., 2004).\nWe have introduced the basic picture of PJ\/SAID forma-\ntion and evolution. We need to question every aspect of this\npicture with new, comprehensive observations. General con-\nclusions about a phenomenon should not be made on the\nM. L.

The abscissa has tick marks at 30-min intervals of UT.\nbasis of a limited number of events observed using the same\ntechnique. It is not even clear whether PJ\/SAIDs and AWFC\nare the same phenomenon. For example, the AWFC reported\nby Parkinson et al. (2003) started near, and might have been\na trigger for, substorm expansion. Other radar observations\nmay ultimately show that AWFCs can commence during the\ngrowth or recovery phase, and even during geomagnetic quiet\nconditions.\nIn this paper, we further investigate the behaviour of an\nAWFC and SAPS observed concurrently by two magneti-\ncally conjugate radars. The present observations will enable\nus to further define the characteristics of AWFCs, as well\nas test whether the different behaviour observed in opposite\nhemispheres can be reconciled with the notion that geomag-\nnetic field lines are equi-potentials. We believe our AWFC\nobservations help to challenge and refine existing models of\nsubstorms and PJ\/SAIDs.\n2 Instruments\nIn this study we report magnetically conjugate HF radar ob-\nservations recorded during the night of 30 November 2002.\nThe interpretation of these observations will be supported by\nmeasurements made by various instruments including:\n1. The Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft\nwas located at geocentric solar magnetospheric (X, Y ,\nZ) co-ordinates of (239.2, 26.5, \u221211.8)RE during the\nstudy interval. We report ACE magnetometer (Smith et\nal., 1998) observations of the interplanetary magnetic\nfield (IMF).\n2. A fluxgate magnetometer is located on Macquarie Is.\n(MQI) (54.5\u25e6 S, 158.9\u25e6 E; \u221265\u25e63), and provides the\nmost direct indication of Hall current flow (Fig. 1) in\nproximity to the radars (Fig. 4). Perturbations in geode-\ntic co-ordinates were transformed to perturbations in the\ngeomagnetic X (North), Y (East), and Z (down) di-\nrections. These components were de-spiked and then\nde-trended by subtracting a baseline defined by averag-\ning their values over day numbers 332 to 336 which in-\ncluded 30 November and adjacent quiet intervals.\n3. The Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) satel-\nlites are in geosynchronous, equatorial orbits of ra-\ndius 6.6RE . The Synchronous Orbit Particle Analyz-\ners (SOPA) measure the spin-averaged differential flux\nof energetic electrons in 16 energy channels between\n50 KeV and 26 MeV and protons in 15 energy chan-\nnels between 50 KeV and >50 MeV. Decreases in parti-\ncle fluxes can occur because magnetic flux tubes stretch\nduring the growth phase of substorms. Subsequent dis-\npersionless increases in particle flux signify the time\n(UT) and location (MLT) of substorm particle injections\n(Henderson et al., 1996).\n4. The uniform design and operation of Super Dual Auro-\nral Radar Network (SuperDARN) radars has been de-\nscribed by Greenwald et al. (1985, 1995). Standard pa-\nrameters returned by the \u201cFITACF\u201d algorithm (Baker\net al., 1995) used to analyse echoes in real time in-\nclude the backscatter power (dB), line-of-sight (LOS)\nDoppler velocity (m s\u22121), and Doppler spectral width\n(m s\u22121). The spectral widths are a measure of the life\n1374 M. L. Parkinson: Interhemispheric asymmetries\nFig. 2.

Each panel shows the results for a different satellite located at a different longitude. Continuous (dotted) vertical\nlines indicate when a satellite was located at local midnight (noon). The differential fluxes are shown on a logarithmic scale, with separate\ncurves for each energy channel: 50\u201375 KeV (top), 75\u2013105 KeV, 105\u2013150 KeV, 150\u2013225 KeV, 225\u2013315 KeV, and 315\u2013500 KeV (bottom)\n(b) The same except for the proton fluxes, with separate curves for each energy channel: 50\u201375 KeV (top), 75\u2013113 KeV, 113\u2013170 KeV,\n170\u2013250 KeV, and 250\u2013400 KeV (bottom)\ntime of ionospheric irregularities, and space and time\nvariations in the LOS Doppler velocity occurring within\nthe sampling volume and integration time. As reviewed\nby Andre\u00b4 et al. (2000), the spectral widths might be\nenhanced by electric field variations in the Pc 1\u20132 fre-\nquency range, micro-scale (\u223c10 m) plasma turbulence,\nand non-uniform convection flows from small (\u223c1 km)\nto large scales (\u223c1000 km).\nA SuperDARN radar is operated by the Communi-\ncations Research Laboratory, Japan, at King Salmon,\nAlaska (58.7\u25e6 N, 203.4\u25e6 E; 57\u25e63) (KGS hereafter). The\nrelatively low magnetic latitude and zonal looking field-\nof-view (FOV) of KGS (Fig. 4a) favours detection of\nlarge westward flows in AWFCs. During the study in-\nterval, KGS performed one full scan every 2 min using\n6 s integrations sequentially from beam 15 (east) to 0\n(west). It mostly operated in the \u201cfixed\u201d frequency band\n10.2 to 10.9 MHz.\nThe Tasman International Geospace Environment Radar\n(TIGER) (Dyson and Devlin, 2000) is located on Bruny\nIs., Tasmania (43.4\u25e6 S, 147.2\u25e6 E; 55\u25e63). TIGER beam\n15, the eastern-most beam, is very sensitive to the de-\ntection of AWFCs (Parkinson et al., 2003) because it\nbecomes a magnetic zonal beam at furthest ranges.\nTIGER performed one full scan every 1 min using 3\ns integrations sequentially from beam 15 to 0. During\n07:30 to 08:08 and 10:25 to 14:30 UT, it operated in\nthe frequency band 9.5 to 9.9 MHz. During 08:09 to\n08:54 UT it operated in the band 17.8 to 17.9 MHz, and\nduring 08:55 to 10:24 UT, it operated in the band 14.5\nto 14.9 MHz.\nM. L. Parkinson: Interhemispheric asymmetries 1375\n5. The Imager for Magnetopause to Aurora Global Explo-\nration (IMAGE) satellite is in a polar orbit with apogee\n7.2RE and perigee 1000 km. During the evening of 30\nNovember, IMAGE made observations of the Northern\nHemisphere. The Wideband Imaging Camera (WIC)\n(Mende et al., 2000) provides global far ultraviolet\n(FUV) images of the aurora by detecting broadband\nemissions from the Lyman-Birge-Hopefield N2 transi-\ntions. In practice, WIC images provided an indication of\nthe energy flux of precipitating KeV electrons (Mende\net al., 2001), and thus also regions of enhanced iono-\nspheric conductivity. WIC images were recorded once\nevery 2 min, the spin period of IMAGE, and they were\nmapped to the same co-ordinates as the radar observa-\ntions. Frey et al. (2001) discussed calibration of WIC\ncounts.\n6. The Defence Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP)\nsatellites are near polar orbiting, Sun synchronous satel-\nlites. They have an altitude of 830 km and an orbital pe-\nriod of 101 min. The SS J\/4 detectors (Hardy et al.,\n1984) measure precipitating ions and electrons every\nsecond from which spectra of differential energy flux\n(eV cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 eV\u22121) are calculated. The spec-\ntra span the energy range 30 eV to 30 KeV. We made\nuse of online energy spectrograms and nightside auroral\noval boundaries automatically identified using the logi-\ncal criteria outlined by Newell et al. (1996).\nThe Special Sensor-Ions, Electrons, and Scintillation\n(SSIES) instruments on board the DMSP satellites con-\nsist of retarding potential analysers, drift meters, Lang-\nmuir probes, and scintillation meters. They provide\nmeasurements of various parameters including plasma\ndensity and ion drift velocity transverse (Vy) to the\nsatellite trajectory. Here we utilise Vy measured at\n4-s resolution during favourable conjunctions with the\nradars.\nObservations made by the different instruments were com-\npared using altitude adjusted corrected geomagnetic co-\nordinates (AACGM) (Baker and Wing, 1989). Observations\nmade with the two HF radars were mapped using the same\nstandard procedures (Yeoman et al., 1999). Small errors\n(<0.5\u25e63) in the registration of radar and DMSP observations\nwere minimised by re-calculating the DMSP co-ordinates us-\ning the same AACGM algorithm.\n3 Observations and analysis\nACE spacecraft measurements of the IMF during 30 Novem-\nber 2002 showed that Bx was approximately \u22125 nT, though\nfluctuating between\u22128 and +6 nT. Similarly, By was approx-\nimately +5 nT, though fluctuating between \u22126 and +8 nT.\nAgain, Bz was approximately \u22124 nT, though fluctuating be-\ntween \u22127 and +6 nT. A noteworthy Bz southward transition\noccurred at 12:40 UT. In summary, despite numerous fluc-\ntuations in all three IMF components, Bx was mostly neg-\nFig. 3.

These timings are also listed\nin Table 1.\native, By was mostly positive, and Bz was mostly negative.\nThere were no major discontinuities in the solar-wind dy-\nnamic pressure.\n3.1 Ground-based magnetometer observations\nMQI fluxgate magnetometer data are shown in Fig. 1. A pos-\nitive bay in the geomagnetic X component commenced near\n06:55 UT, the start of a substantial substorm. MQI was lo-\ncated near 18:41 MLT and so, as expected, a positive bay\ncorresponding to an enhanced eastward electrojet was ob-\nserved. As MQI rotated further toward the east it eventually\ncame under the influence of the westward electrojet which\nmay have also expanded westward. MQI recorded negative\nonset-like (O) signatures at 07:50 and 08:23 UT, a peak ex-\npansion phase (P) at 08:39 UT, and the nominal end of recov-\nery phase (R) at 09:07 UT. The earliest signature of a second\nsubstorm was a small negative bay commencing at 10:27 UT.\nSubsequent expansion signatures commenced near 11:33 and\n12:54 UT. Peak expansion phase was observed at 14:03 UT,\nand the nominal end of recovery phase was 16:58 UT.\nThese onset times are similar to, but slightly later, than\nthose measured by the CANOPUS magnetometer array lo-\ncated further to the east in the Northern Hemisphere. Nega-\ntive bays in the geodetic X component were consistent with\nthe first substorm having an onset near 06:55 UT, and a sub-\nsequent peak expansion of \u223c700 nT near 08:20 UT. The sec-\nond substorm was also revealed by ongoing negative deflec-\ntions commencing near \u223c10:20 UT. The magnetometer data\nwere complicated because they suggested the occurrence of\n1376 M.

Figure 2b shows the same\nexcept for protons. To reduce clutter, particle fluxes are only\nshown for the six lowest energy channels for electrons and\nthe five lowest energy channels for protons. Table 1 lists the\nestimated times of energetic particle flux decreases most rel-\nevant to our coincident radar observations, and Fig. 3 sum-\nmarises the timings for low energy ions (inner circle) and\nelectrons (outer circle). Note that (1) whilst most flux de-\ncreases and subsequent increases were probably indicative\nof substorm-related particle injections, this is not necessarily\nthe case, and (2) the geosynchronous orbits of LANL satel-\nlites map to magnetic latitude \u223c66.5\u25e63, or 2 to 3\u25e6 poleward\nof the AWFCs detected by the radars.\nSatellite 1991\u2013080 was located near dusk when it ob-\nserved a decrease in proton flux at 06:45 UT (Fig. 2b,\npanel 5). Satellite 1990\u2013095 (Fig. 2a, panel 6) was lo-\ncated near dawn when it measured a weak decrease in elec-\ntron flux at \u223c06:53 UT. Satellite 1994\u2013084 was located near\ndusk when it measured a weak decrease in electron flux at\n\u223c07:15 UT, and proton flux at 06:50 UT . The broad peaks\nin electron flux observed by all satellites between \u223c08 and\n10 UT may represent a continuation of the injection com-\nmencing just prior to 07 UT. This becomes apparent when\nthe fluxes in higher energy channels (not shown) are exam-\nined.\nA more intense sequence of activity commenced after\n10 UT. Satellite 1994-084 (Fig. 2a, panel 4) was located from\nlate evening to just past magnetic midnight when it recorded\nconsiderable activity from 10 to 17 h UT. As Table 1 lists,\nsubstantial decreases in electron flux, followed by fairly sud-\nden increases across many energy channels, were observed\nat \u223c10:20, 11:33, 12:09, 13:01, 14:15 UT, and at other times\nbeyond our radar observations. Table 1 lists the correspond-\ning magnetic local times (MLTs) of these observations.\nSatellite LANL-97A (Fig. 2a, panel 3) was located \u223c3 h\nearlier in the evening sector when substantial decreases in\nelectron flux were observed at \u223c13:20, 13:58 UT, and more\nafterwards. Low energy proton measurements made by satel-\nlite 1994-084 (Fig. 2b, panel 4) suggest the entire interval 6\nto 19 h UT was active. Substantial decreases in proton flux\nwere observed at 10:23, 14:10 UT, and at various other times.\nSimilarily, the satellite LANL-97A observed substantial de-\ncreases at \u223c13:20, 13:49 UT, and more afterwards. Satellite\n1991\u2013080 (panel 5) was located close to midnight when it\nobserved a decrease in proton flux at \u223c10:22 UT.\nIn summary, these complicated LANL energy spectra pro-\nvided important information about changes in the outer radi-\nTable 1.

The periods are slightly longer for\nelectrons.\nAlthough the exact sequence of radiation belt events is\ndifficult to decipher due to the multiple onsets and injec-\ntions, the LANL results are basically consistent with ground-\nbased magnetograms which show the onset of a substan-\ntial substorm shortly after \u223c06:45 UT (Substorm A), and at\n\u223c10:20 UT (Substorm B).\n3.3 Full-scan radar observations and coincident satellite\nobservations\nThe following full-scan observations are shown because of\ntheir good coincidence in space and time with the trajectory\nof the DMSP F14 satellite, and because they were represen-\ntative of other observations. Reproducing all the one- or\ntwo-minute resolution full-scan plots would be impractical.\nNote that all data have been mapped to a \u201cclock dial\u201d con-\nsisting of MLT and magnetic latitude, and echoes identified\nas \u201cground scatter\u201d by FITACF have been excluded.\nFigure 4a shows KGS radar observations of LOS Doppler\nvelocity for the full-scan commencing at 08:15:59 UT. Fig-\nure 4b shows TIGER observations of the same, except for\nthe full-scan commencing at 08:15:00 UT. The full-scan\nobservations were separated in this way because otherwise\nthe coloured pixels overlap and become illegible. Note the\n1378 M. L. Parkinson: Interhemispheric asymmetries\ncolour scale used for KGS velocities in Fig. 4a was shifted\ntoward large negative values (i.e. receding toward the west),\nwhereas the colour scale used for TIGER velocities was\nshifted toward moderate positive values (i.e. approaching to-\nward the east). These Doppler shifts are consistent with the\norientation of the radar FOVs with respect to an AWFC.\nThe background contours show variations in WIC FUV\nauroral counts in the Northern Hemisphere recorded on board\nthe IMAGE satellite at 08:15:54 UT. These counts were\nmapped to the Southern Hemisphere (Fig. 4b) simply by\ninverting their magnetic latitudes. These FUV emissions\nwere recorded well past the earliest onset signatures of Sub-\nstorm A (06:55 and 07:50 UT); hence the extensive latitudi-\nnal width of the auroral oval. Comparing this image with the\nprevious WIC image at 08:13:50 UT shows a rapid poleward\nand westward surge toward dusk had just occurred.\nDMSP SSIES measurements were made on board the F14\nsatellite which traversed the Northern Hemisphere through\nthe western-most part of the KGS radar FOV during 08:14\nto 08:18 UT. The footprint of the spacecraft was \u223c1 h to the\nwest of the main patch of scatter detected by both KGS and\nTIGER. Note that F14 measurements may have systematic\nerrors due to failure of the electronics used to negate the\neffects of spacecraft charging. Hence these offsets will be\ngreatest for dayside measurements. Nevertheless, the F14 re-\nsults were similar to those obtained by the F13 and F15 satel-\nlites, and are consistent with the interpretation of the radar\nobservations.\nFigure 4a includes SSIES measurements of ion density\nat 4-s resolution superimposed along the satellite trajectory\nusing a transverse scale of 5000 ions cm\u22123 per degree of\nmagnetic latitude (\u25e63). Although made further to the west\nand in the topside ionosphere, these measurements suggest\nthe AWFC may have been centred near a localised trough\nin ion density of \u223c9200 cm\u22123 located at 66.7\u25e63. This con-\ntrasts with the peak ion density of \u223c50 000 cm\u22123 located at\n70.7\u25e63, near the poleward edge of the region of FUV emis-\nsion (background contours).\nDMSP F14 automatic nightside auroral oval boundaries\nwere in good agreement with the location of WIC FUV emis-\nsions. During this F14 satellite pass, the equatorward edges\nof the electron (ion) aurora were located at 66.6\u25e63 (64.5\u25e63),\nand the poleward edges of the electron (ion) aurora were lo-\ncated at 67.9\u25e63 (71.1\u25e63). Online spectrograms showed en-\nhanced fluxes of 1 to 10 KeV electron precipitation in a nar-\nrow band centred near 67.6\u25e63, close to the peak FUV emis-\nsion along the track. We conclude the AWFC straddled the\nequatorward edge of the auroral oval.\nThe KGS radar recorded scatter with the LOS Doppler ve-\nlocity generally increasing on the western-most beams which\nlook toward lower latitude, and more zonally (Fig. 4a). For\nexample, LOS velocities <\u2212760 m s\u22121 were observed on\nbeam 3 near 19:15 MLT and 65\u25e63, consistent with the pres-\nence of an AWFC. The orientation of the scatter and veloci-\nties suggest the AWFC was tilted poleward toward the west.\nThe WIC FUV data suggest the radar scatter and AWFC\noverlapped diffuse auroral emissions.\nFigure 4b shows LOS velocities recorded by the TIGER\nradar in the Southern Hemisphere. TIGER recorded large\napproaching LOS velocities (>450 m s\u22121) on beam 15, and\nlarge receding velocities (<\u2212350 m s\u22121) on beam 0, both\nnear \u221264\u25e63. Hence the AWFC was located at similar lat-\nitudes in the Southern and Northern Hemispheres. However,\nthe distribution of scatter and LOS velocities suggest that a\nsecond, weaker AWFC may have been located further pole-\nward near \u221267\u25e63. Even further poleward, the LOS veloci-\nties were equatorward on nearly all beams, probably due to\nthe LOS component of return sunward flows in a contracted\nafternoon convection cell.\nSSIES measurements of transverse velocity, Vy , the most\nreliable velocity component, are superimposed in Fig. 4b us-\ning a transverse scale of 100 m s\u22121 \u25e63\u22121. The two largest\npeak Vy\u2019s of 1210 m s\u22121 near 63.8\u25e63 and 1506 m s\u22121 near\n66.8\u25e63 were coincident in space and time with the main\nAWFC signatures recorded by TIGER. Likewise, a local\nminimum in Vy of 205 m s\u22121 near 67.7\u25e63 was coincident\nwith the most intense electron precipitation identified in both\nDMSP and IMAGE measurements. Radar scatter also tended\nto be absent in these regions. The westward flows extend-\ning equatorward of the auroral oval were structured, suggest-\ning the presence of bifurcated or multiple AWFCs imbedded\nwithin the return sunward flows. DMSP measurements re-\nveal similar structured flow on a routine basis.\nFigure 5a shows KGS observations of LOS Doppler ve-\nlocity measured for a full-scan commencing much later dur-\ning the evening at 11:03:59 UT. Figure 5b shows TIGER\nobservations of the same. Again, the background contours\nshow variations of WIC FUV counts, this time recorded at\n11:04:19 UT. The preceding time sequence of WIC images\nrevealed the poleward extension of emission located near\n22:50 MLT was often far more intense earlier during Sub-\nstorm B. The auroral oval was also thinner, and did not ex-\ntend as far poleward as shown in Fig. 4a. Overall, the inten-\nsity of emission was lower than in Fig. 4.\nA DMSP F14 satellite pass in the Southern Hemisphere,\nwhen mapped to the Northern Hemisphere, was coincident\nwith these observations. Again, the F14 automatic night-\nside auroral oval boundaries agreed with the location of WIC\nFUV emissions. During this F14 satellite pass, the equa-\ntorward edges of the electron (ion) aurora were located at\n\u221262.9\u25e63(\u221262.9\u25e63), and the corresponding poleward edges\nwere located at \u221268.3\u25e63 (\u221268.6\u25e63). Online spectrograms\nshowed enhanced fluxes of 1 to 10 KeV electron precipita-\ntion commencing poleward of \u221265.7\u25e63, in agreement with\nthe largest FUV counts. The KGS observations (Fig. 5a) re-\nvealed scatter with large LOS velocity (<\u2212650 m s\u22121) con-\ncentrated on beams 0 to 5. The magnitude of LOS velocities\nincreased toward beam 0, the most equatorward and zonal\nbeam, and they also increased with group range. The speeds\nhad maximum values <\u2212850 m s\u22121 on beam 0 at the fur-\nthest ranges. The observed Doppler characteristics, namely\nan increase in westward drift toward the west, combined with\nproximity of the scatter to midnight, imply observation of the\nspatial origin of the AWFC. The structure of FUV emissions\nM. L. Parkinson: Interhemispheric asymmetries 1379\nFig. 5.

Parkinson: Interhemispheric asymmetries\nin this region may also provide important clues about the for-\nmation and evolution of the AWFC and substorm.\nThe LOS velocity was often observed to increase in range\nfrom the radar. However, the actual Doppler shifts imparted\nto the backscattered radio waves is an integral of the Doppler\nshifts encountered along the ray path (Bennet, 1968; Dyson,\n1975). The observed velocity profile can be inverted to infer\nthe true velocity profile (Dyson et al., 2001). Although this is\na second-order effect, it does imply the velocities at furthest\nranges were significantly larger than observed, perhaps by\n10% or more for the zonal looking beams.\nF14 SSIES measurements of the transverse velocity, Vy ,\nwere superimposed in Fig. 5a. The F14 satellite was di-\nrectly conjugate to the ionospheric scatter recorded by KGS\nnear 11:04:02 UT. Vy was large and westward in this conju-\ngate region, having two main peaks, 786 m s\u22121 at \u221262.0\u25e63,\nand 990 m s\u22121 at \u221265.6\u25e63. However, Vy was suppressed in\nthe region of strongest FUV emission. A convection rever-\nsal boundary (CRB) signature was located near to \u221268\u25e63,\naligned with the poleward edge of the auroral oval. Vy also\nreversed in sign several times poleward of the FUV emis-\nsions, suggesting the presence of strong plasma circulation\nin proximity to the onset region. Further into the polar cap,\nthe SSIES velocities were consistent with the expected anti-\nsunward flows.\nTIGER observations (Fig. 5b) revealed substantial ap-\nproaching LOS velocities (>270 m s\u22121) on beam 15, and re-\nceding velocities (<\u2212210 m s\u22121) on beam 0, overlapping the\nequatorward limit of the FUV emissions. The largest LOS\nvelocities were probably slightly higher in latitude on beam\n0 than beam 15, suggesting a poleward tilt of the AWFC.\nAgain, the main peak SSIES Vy of 786 m s\u22121 at \u221262.0\u25e63\nagreed with the location of the AWFC identified by TIGER.\nPoleward of the auroral oval, the TIGER LOS velocities were\nweak and receding (>\u2212150 m s\u22121) on the western beams,\nand weaker and variable in sign on the eastern beams. The\nlatter implies the presence of strong circulation in the flow\npattern, as did the reversals in SSIES Vy .\nAll data sets suggest the presence of AWFC-type struc-\nture overlapping the equatorward edge of the auroral oval.\nThe SSIES westward velocities observed during numerous\nDMSP passes on this evening were generally narrower and\nweaker near midnight (e.g. Fig. 5), and broader and stronger\nnear dusk (e.g. Fig. 4b), suggesting that AWFCs \u201cspread out\u201d\nand strengthen toward dusk. They also suggest large reced-\ning velocities would sometimes be observed on imaginary\nbeams pointing even further equatorward.\nFinally, the ionospheric scatter and spectral widths (not\nshown) observed by KGS and TIGER tended to be absent or\nweaker at the ranges of peak FUV emission. Also, the iono-\nspheric scatter observed by TIGER tended to be absent or\nweaker on the meridional beams at the latitude of the AWFC\n(e.g. Fig. 5b). As discussed by Parkinson et al. (2004a),\nthe former is consistent with the tendency for precipitation-\nenhanced Pedersen conductivity to suppress electric fields,\nirregularity production (Vickrey and Kelley, 1982), and spec-\ntral widths. The latter is consistent with the important role of\nprimary gradient drift waves in the generation of 10-m scale\nirregularities.\n3.4 Beam-swinging results\nThe beam-swinging technique described by Ruohoniemi et\nal. (1989) assumes a uniform velocity component along mag-\nnetic L shells. Freeman et al. (1991) modelled the technique\nand found it was reasonably accurate. In the absence of dual\nradar observations, the beam-swinging technique was used\nhere as a tool to help visualise the basic flow patterns implied\nby the observed Doppler shifts, but many of the small-scale\nfeatures should not be believed. The LOS velocities recorded\nby radars in opposite hemispheres could be combined if it\nwere not for uncertainties in the field-line mapping.\nThe TIGER observations were ideal for a beam-swinging\nanalysis because the eastern- and western-most beams\nlooked at oblique angles to the zonal flows. However, no\nbeam-swinging results are presented for KGS because the\nwestern-most beams (0 to 4) looked along the axis of the\nAWFC and provided insufficient variation of Doppler shift\nwith azimuth to work. Moreover, the eastern-most beams\n(12 to 15) recorded scatter from a separate high-latitude flow\nregime which corrupted estimates of the two-dimensional\nflow vectors for the AWFC.\nFigure 6a shows the two-dimensional flow vectors esti-\nmated along TIGER beam 4, the magnetic meridian point-\ning beam, during the interval, 07:30 to 11:00 UT. Figure 6b\nshows the same for the interval, 11:00 to 14:30 UT. The re-\nsults are separated in this way to maintain legibility of in-\ndividual vectors and flow patterns. The vectors have been\ncalculated using 5-min resolution, and the flow speeds have\nbeen colour-coded using increments of 100 m s\u22121. Note the\nisolated drifts >1 km s\u22121 scattered throughout the plot may\nbe erroneous.\nFigure 6a reveals the initial, large (red) westward drifts\nduring Substorm A interval, 08:10 to 09:10 UT (20 MLT),\nhad a significant poleward component, as did the equator-\nward edge of the auroral oval (cf. Fig. 4a). The veloc-\nities tended to expand equatorward and increase in speed\nduring this interval. The velocities ranged between \u223c600\nand 1300 m s\u22121 within the AWFC, but these were probably\nunder-estimated because the narrow AWFC was not aligned\nwith L shells, a requirement of the beam-swinging analysis.\nThe westward velocities found poleward of the AWFC rep-\nresent return sunward flows in the afternoon convection cell.\nThe speed of these flows were less than in the AWFC. There\nis also evidence for velocity enhancements (green to orange)\nexpanding equatorward to the latitude of the AWFC. Near\nto 10:30 UT, shortly after the start of Substorm B, the flow\nspeeds were suppressed (Provan et al., 2004).\nFigure 6b reveals the subsequent flows poleward of the\nAWFC were weak and erratic, but equatorward and east-\nward flows gradually developed, and were well defined be-\nyond\u223c13:00 UT. The westward flows within the AWFC had\na weak poleward component after 11:00 UT (\u223c23 MLT), as\ndid the equatorward edge of the auroral oval (Fig. 5b). They\nM. L. Parkinson: Interhemispheric asymmetries 1381\nFig. 6. (a) Two-dimensional flow vectors estimated along TIGER beam 4 using the beam-swinging technique at 5-min time resolution during\n07:30 to 11:00 UT on 30 November 2002. The solid dots identify the time and latitude of the velocity estimate, and the lines point in the\ndirection of the flows. Flows directed toward the right were eastward, and toward the bottom, equatorward. The flow speeds are colour coded\nfrom <50 m s\u22121 (black) to >850 m s\u22121 (red). Tick marks are at 5-min intervals. (b) The same as Fig. 6a except for the interval 11:00 to\n14:30 UT on 30 November 2002.\nwere also fairly laminar over\u223c4\u25e63 of latitude, but the beam-\nswinging technique may have broadened the latitudinal width\n(Parkinson et al., 2003). The poleward edge of the west-\nward flows within the AWFC migrated equatorward between\n12:35 and 13:40 UT (\u223c01 MLT). The AWFC may have per-\nsisted at lower latitude in the dusk to midnight sector, but\nwas no longer observed by radars that had rotated into the\nmorning sector.\n3.5 HF radar observations: Time series representations\nFigure 7 presents a summary plot showing the conjugate HF\nradar observations occurring during 07:30 to 14:30 UT on\n30 November 2002. The same substorm phases shown in\nFig. 1 are superimposed, since we aim to reconcile changes\nin the character of the radar scatter with substorm activity.\nPart (a) is a range-time plot of the LOS Doppler velocity\n(m s\u22121) measured on KGS beam 2, whereas part (b) is the\nsame measured on TIGER beam 14. The colour scale used\nfor KGS velocities was shifted toward large negative values\n(i.e. receding toward the west), whereas the colour scale used\n1382 M. L. Parkinson: Interhemispheric asymmetries\nFig. 7. (a) Range-time plot of the LOS Doppler velocity (m s\u22121) measured on King Salmon (KGS) beam 2 during 07:30 to 14:30 UT on 30\nNovember 2002. (b) The same measured on TIGER beam 14. Thin vertical lines represent the same substorm phases shown in Fig. 1. Thin,\nblack, horizontal lines represent magnetic latitudes and abscissas have tick marks at 15-min intervals of UT. Nominal values of MLT above\nMQI are also given.\nfor TIGER was shifted toward moderate positive values (i.e.\napproaching toward the east). The senses of these Doppler\nshifts are consistent with the presence of a persistent AWFC.\nObservations recorded on KGS beam 2 are shown because\nthey had the most continuous ionospheric scatter helping to\ndefine the occurrence of the AWFC in the Northern Hemi-\nsphere. This beam also pointed just poleward of magnetic\nwest, and probably looked nearly directly along the AWFC\n(cf. Fig. 4a). Similarly, observations recorded on TIGER\nbeam 14 are shown because it became a magnetic eastward\nbeam at furthest ranges, and it had the best scatter helping to\ndefine the occurrence of the AWFC in the Southern Hemi-\nsphere.\nBy itself, the band of ionospheric scatter recorded on KGS\nbeam 2 suggests the presence of an AWFC. However, the\nradar beam looked zonally, nearly along the length of the\nAWFC, so the width of the scatter in group range does not\nrepresent the width of the AWFC in latitude. Rather, it repre-\nsents the width of the group range interval over which propa-\ngation conditions enabled detection of echoes from F-region\nirregularities. Hence, not withstanding the effects described\nby Bennet (1968) and Dyson (1975), variations in the LOS\nvelocity with range better represent changes in velocity with\nlongitude, whereas the time variation in LOS velocity at a\nfixed range gives a reasonable estimate of time variations in\nvelocity within the flow channel.\nThe same arguments apply in the case of TIGER beam 14\nobservations, but to a much lesser extent because this beam\nwas more oblique to the ionospheric flows. Hence the width\nin group range of scatter with large velocity was a better mea-\nsure of the width of the AWFC in magnetic latitude, and tem-\nporal variation of velocity within the flow channel must be\ninferred by allowing for the oblique angle between the radar\nbeam and AWFC.\nFigure 7a shows the first hint of ionospheric scatter with\nlarge westward speed >800 m s\u22121 (blue and black) was\nrecorded on KGS beam 2 near \u223c08:13 UT. The largest flow\nburst during the entire event with speeds >1 km s\u22121 occurred\nduring the subsequent interval \u223c08:13 to 09:15 UT. As will\nbe shown, the peak westward speed was \u223c1500 m s\u22121 at\n08:40 UT, near to the peak of expansion phase. This initial,\nintense flow burst was nearly synchronised with the most in-\ntense negative bay of Substorm A recorded by the MQI mag-\nnetometer (cf. Fig. 1). It was also coincident with the most\nintense part of Substorm A recorded by the Canadian mag-\nnetometer array.\nFigure 7b shows that large approaching speeds\n>360 m s\u22121 (red) were observed by TIGER at low lat-\nitude (\u221263\u25e6 to \u221264\u25e63) during the interval 08:09 to\n09:15 UT. Similar to the results for KGS beam 2, this\ninitial flow burst was synchronised with the most intense\nnegative bay of Substorm A, though it was detected \u223c4 min\nM. L. Parkinson: Interhemispheric asymmetries 1383\nearlier. The AWFC suddenly appeared on TIGER beam 14\nat 08:09 UT. This time corresponds to a change in the radar\noperating frequency from \u223c9.7 MHz to \u223c17.8 MHz, made\nautomatically by an algorithm designed to optimise the\ndetection of ionospheric scatter (Hughes et al., 2002). The\nlarge change in operating frequency implies the AWFC may\nhave existed prior to 08:09 UT, but the intervening plasma\ndensity was too large to favour its detection at 9.7 MHz.\nUp to ten bands of scatter with large approaching speed\n>360 m s\u22121 (red) were observed expanding equatorward,\nstarting from \u223c\u221271\u25e63 and lower latitude, during the inter-\nval 08:09 to 10:24 UT. WIC FUV images (e.g. Fig. 4b) sug-\ngest the poleward boundary of the auroral oval, or the OCB,\nwas located far poleward of their origin. Some of the bands\nmerged into the main band of scatter corresponding to the\nAWFC at \u223c\u221264\u25e63. They reveal a sequence of narrow chan-\nnels of intense westward drift expanding equatorward within\nthe return sunward flow of the main dusk convection cell. So\nfar, we have not been able to relate these equatorward ex-\npansions to changes in particle flux observed by the LANL\nspacecraft \u2013 they may represent substorm-related reconnec-\ntion, or the Earthward migration of polarisation fields in the\ninner magnetosphere on closed field lines. The detailed re-\nlationship between these bands and auroral emissions needs\ninvestigation.\nThe change in the character of TIGER scatter at 10:25 UT\nwas related to a change in the radar operating frequency from\n\u223c14.7 MHz to 9.7 MHz. Perhaps more irregularities were\nsuddenly detected using \u223c9.7 MHz because of a change in\npropagation conditions triggered by a change in precipita-\ntion at \u223c10:20 UT, the start of Substorm B (cf. Gauld et al.,\n2002). From this time onwards, the scatter at latitudes pole-\nward of \u221266\u25e63 was dominated by echoes receding from the\nradar (blue and black), whereas the scatter at lower latitudes\ncontinued to be dominated by positive velocities (red). This\nis consistent with the observation of return sunward flows in\nthe morning convection cell at higher latitude, a flow rever-\nsal boundary (FRB) located near \u221266\u25e63, and a persistent\nAWFC at lower latitude.\nFigure 7b shows a band of scatter with very low velocity\n\u223c0 m s\u22121 (blue) was observed at near group ranges during\n08:09 to 08:50 UT, just equatorward of the band of scat-\nter revealing the initial flow burst (red). The two bands of\nscatter had different elevation angles and were separated by\na sharp discontinuity. Combined, this suggests the nearer\nscatter was from E-region irregularities and the further scat-\nter was from F-region irregularities. Large westward drifts\nin the AWFC may have extended further equatorward than\npropagation conditions permitted the radar to observe (cf. the\nSSIES Vy observations, Fig. 4b).\nAfter 10:25 UT, there was an artificially sharp cut-off in\nionospheric scatter equatorward of group range \u223c720 km or\nlatitude \u221261\u25e63. This is probably because radio waves trans-\nmitted at higher elevation angles were no longer orthogo-\nnal to the magnetic field lines. Especially after 13:10 UT,\nan AWFC may have persisted at lower latitudes, but further\nequatorward than propagation conditions permitted the radar\nto observe. Again, SSIES observations suggest that large\nwestward drifts did extend further equatorward. We conclude\nthe radars observed the most poleward portion of the AWFC\nactivity.\n3.6 Multi-beam time series representations\nA comparison of the results recorded on all 16 beams of both\nradars reveals more features relevant to the AWFC dynam-\nics. Figure 8a shows the maximum LOS speed found within\nthe latitude range 61\u25e6 to 65\u25e63 for all 16 beams of the KGS\nradar. Part (b) shows the same except for TIGER. Again, the\ncolour scale used for KGS velocities is shifted toward large\nnegative values because of the large westward motions, es-\npecially on the more equatorward and zonal beams (0 to 4).\nSimilarly, the colour scale used for TIGER is shifted toward\nlarge positive values because of the same underlying zonal\nmotion, especially on the more equatorward and eastward\nbeams (12 to 15). The LOS speeds reversed in sign on the\nwestward-looking beams (0 to 3).\nFigure 8a shows a peak in the LOS speed expanding equa-\ntorward, commencing on beam 14 near 07:50 UT, and reach-\ning beam 1 at 08:22 UT. This equatorward expansion com-\nmenced simultaneously with the negative bay onset-like (O)\nsignature observed by the MQI magnetometer at 07:50 UT.\nIonospheric scatter with large receding Doppler velocities\ncommenced as early as 07:58 UT on KGS beam 4, and the\nband of scatter signifying the AWFC did not disappear until\n13:16 UT on KGS beam 0. These results extend the time in-\nterval over which the AWFC activity was directly observed.\nPeak speeds observed by TIGER in the AWFC were not\nclosely synchronised with the peak speeds observed by KGS.\nFor example, the initial large flows observed by TIGER were\ncentred near 08:36 UT, but not until 08:40 UT in KGS ob-\nservations. The decrease in TIGER speeds centred near\n10:28 UT may have been caused by particle-precipitation\nenhanced Pedersen conductivity, but a similar feature was\nnot observed by KGS. Enhanced speeds were centred near\n12:00 UT in KGS observations, but the TIGER speeds di-\nminished at this time. Careful inspection of Fig. 7 reveals\nother discrepancies.\n3.7 Conjugacy of AWFCs\nMagnetic field lines are usually considered to be equipoten-\ntials, and thus, to first order, the AWFCs observed in oppo-\nsite hemispheres should be the same. If the results for the two\nradars cannot be reconciled then anomalous field-aligned po-\ntential drops are needed to explain the different electric field\nobserved at opposite ends of the same magnetic flux tube.\nFigure 9a shows peak speeds observed on KGS beam 2 (blue)\nand TIGER beam 14 (red) within the magnetic latitude range\n61\u25e6 to 65\u25e63 which includes the AWFC. Figure 9b shows the\nmagnetic latitudes corresponding to the group ranges of peak\nspeeds identified in 9a, where the conjugate TIGER latitudes\nhave been inverted to the Northern Hemisphere.\n1384 M. L. Parkinson: Interhemispheric asymmetries\nFig. 8. (a) The maximum LOS speed found with the latitude range 61\u25e6 to 65\u25e63 for all 16 beams of the KGS radar. For the lowest beam\nnumbers (0 to 4), this latitude range tended to select peak speeds within the scatter associated with the AWFC. (b) The same except for all\n16 beams of the TIGER radar. Similarly, for the highest beam numbers (11 to 15), this latitude range tended to select peak speeds within the\nscatter associated with the AWFC.\nChisham and Freeman (2003a,b) used median filtering to\nreliably identify the spectral width boundary (SWB), an im-\nportant feature in the radar data. Median filtering in space\nand time is an effective way to suppress measurement noise\nassociated with inadequate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the\nradar pulse set, and the FITACF algorithm. In Fig. 9, the\nranges of peak speeds were automatically identified using an\nalgorithm requiring the detection of at least three ionospheric\nechoes with SNR >3 dB during each integration. A median\nfilter of dimension 3 was then applied prior to detecting the\nmaxima (bold dots). The continuous curves are the results\nobtained after applying another median filter of dimension\n3, but now in the time domain. Despite the scatter, the final\ncurves represent real trends in the data.\nPJ\/SAIDs are thought to be coherent structures extend-\ning over many hours of MLT, they are generally weaker and\nbroader at dusk, and expand equatorward with MLT and con-\nverge in width with time (Anderson et al. 2001; Karlsson et\nal., 1998). An examination of full-scan data for our conjugate\nevent (Figs. 4 and 5) suggests an orientation slightly pole-\nward of magnetic west. However, it is very difficult deter-\nmining the exact orientation of the AWFC without dual radar\nobservations in the same hemisphere, thereby unaffected by\nuncertainties in the magnetic field line mapping.\nConsidering Fig. 4a, KGS beam 2 must have pointed\nroughly in the same direction of the velocities within the\nAWFC. These LOS velocities can be re-interpreted as the\npeak westward speeds within the AWFC, but they must be\nan under-estimate because beam 2 probably pointed slightly\npoleward of the AWFC, and its beamwidth probably smeared\nover the fine-scale velocity structure. The probable angular\ndifference is only \u223c10\u25e6; hence the speeds shown in Fig. 8\nwere scaled up by the factor sec( 10\u25e6), or a mere 1.5%. Even\nif the error in the direction were 20\u25e6, the velocities would\nonly be 6.4% larger, still a relatively minor correction.\nAn examination of TIGER full-scan data for the present\nevent suggests it was aligned with the equatorward edge of\nthe auroral oval which was tilted slightly equatorward of\ngeodetic west. TIGER beam 14 points 21.06\u25e6 to the east of\nthe geodetic pole; hence the LOS speeds were scaled up by\nthe factor cosec (21.06\u25e6), or 278%. However, even if the\nangular difference between the AWFC and beam 14 were\none beamwidth (\u223c4\u25e6) less, the scaling factor would decrease\nto 236%. Clearly, the errors involved in scaling the TIGER\nspeeds are large because of the way in which beam 14 tran-\nsects the AWFC at oblique angles.\nThe results presented in Fig. 9a show our best estimates of\nvariations in conjugate AWFC speeds in the Northern (blue)\nand Southern (red) Hemispheres. Both radars observed peak\nspeeds of \u223c1600 m s\u22121 and their is a surprising amount of\nresemblance between many of the short-term fluctuations.\nOverall, the major variations in speed observed in the North-\nM. L. Parkinson: Interhemispheric asymmetries 1385\nFig. 9. (a) The maximum speeds identified within the latitude range 61\u25e6 to 65\u25e63 along KGS beam 2 (blue) and TIGER beam 14 (red). This\nlatitude range selects peak speeds within the scatter associated with the AWFCs (cf. Fig. 7). The speeds were scaled up to allow for difference\nbetween the orientation of the radar beams and the AWFC (see text). (b) The bold dots show the AACGM latitude of the corresponding\ngroup ranges of the results shown in (a). The continuous curves were obtained by applying a median filter of dimension 3 in the time domain.\nern and Southern Hemisphere were similar, lending support\nto the notion that magnetic field lines are equipotentials.\nNevertheless, there were significant differences, and our re-\nsults suggest the peak speeds were slightly larger in the flow\nchannel observed in the Southern Hemisphere.\nThe KGS beam 2 speeds declined toward a minimum of\n\u223c352 m s\u22121 at 10:18 UT, whence they gradually increased\nagain, reaching a maximum of \u223c882 m s\u22121 at 12:08 UT, be-\nfore declining again. The increase in speed commencing near\n10:18 UT was near to the start of Substorm B, and the time of\nmaximum speed, 12:08 UT, was near to the last of three elec-\ntron flux increases observed by LANL 1994\u2013084 at \u223c10:20,\n11:33, and 12:09 UT (Table 1). However, more particle in-\njections were subsequently observed, and the ground-based\nmagnetometers showed the westward electrojet continued to\nintensify. AWFC activity may have continued to expand\nequatorward in the pre-midnight sector beyond 13:00 UT.\nFigure 9b shows the magnetic latitudes corresponding to\nthe locations of peak speed within the AWFC in the North-\nern (blue) and Southern (red) Hemispheres. The results for\nKGS beam 2 and TIGER beam 14 nearly always agree within\n\u223c1\u25e63, but there were many fluctuations in the median fil-\ntered locations (continuous curves). However, many of the\nfluctuations were erroneous. For example, the equatorward\njump in latitude at 10:32 UT is an artefact caused by chang-\ning propagation conditions and measurement noise. The ac-\ncuracy of the results should be judged in the context of the\nactual LOS measurements shown in Fig. 7.\nDuring \u223c08:10 to 09:10 UT, the signature of the AWFC\nobserved by TIGER was consistently\u223c1\u25e63 further poleward\nthan observed by KGS. The latitudes gradually converged\nuntil \u223c09:45 UT, whence the situation reversed. Between\n\u223c09:50 to 12:34 UT, the signature of the AWFC observed\nby KGS tended to be located slightly poleward of that ob-\nserved by TIGER. A poleward inflection in the location of\nthe AWFC was observed by TIGER centred on 12:40 UT\n(cf. Fig. 7b). There was no change in the radar operating\nfrequency at this time. The latitude of peak speed expanded\nequatorward between 12:40 and 13:13 UT, and then \u201csatu-\nrated\u201d at \u221261\u25e63 between 13:13 and 13:58 UT. The AWFC\nhad expanded to the equatorward limit of where F-region\nscatter could be detected.\nDisagreements between the two hemispheres are partly\nexplained by temporal variations in the orientations of the\nAWFCs, latitudinal variations in their location (Fig. 9b), and\nmeasurement noise. There may have also been significant\nvariations in the convolution between the beam and pulse\nwidths with fine-scale velocity structure within the AWFCs.\nFor example, a different velocity would be observed depend-\ning on whether a narrow spike in the velocity profile was\nlocated in the centre or the periphery of a 45-km wide pulse.\nHowever, these factors do not explain all of the differences.\n1386 M. L. Parkinson: Interhemispheric asymmetries\n4 Discussion and conclusions\nPrevious satellite observations have reported a 30-min de-\nlay between substorm onset and the occurrence of PJ\/SAIDs\n(Anderson et al., 1993). Parkinson et al. (2003) analysed ob-\nservations of an AWFC occurring on 27 February 2003, and\nfound the event commenced near substorm onset, and rapidly\ndecayed near the end of recovery phase. The AWFC and\nsubstorm activity was more complex on 30 November 2002,\nwith LANL geosynchronous satellite and ground-based mag-\nnetometer data suggesting multiple onsets during two ex-\ntended intervals of substorm activity. We referred to these\nintervals as \u201cSubstorm A\u201d and \u201cSubstorm B.\u201d\nThere can be no doubt the AWFC activity reported here\ncommenced before the recovery phase, and it probably com-\nmenced at substorm onset. For example, a peak in the ve-\nlocity expanded equatorward, commencing on KGS beam 14\nnear 07:50 UT (Fig. 8a), an expansion onset signature of Sub-\nstorm A. Large westward drift velocities probably occurred\nprior to their detection by TIGER at 08:09 UT. Echoes from\nan AWFC were probably not observed earlier simply because\npropagation conditions did not favour the detection of irreg-\nularities via 0.5-hop propagation at the chosen operating fre-\nquency. We suspect that AWFC activity actually commenced\nnear the time of the first particle injections detected by the\nLANL satellites shortly after \u223c06:45 UT. As of yet, we have\nfound no direct evidence of AWFCs commencing during the\nsubstorm growth phase.\nAt face value, the peak velocities within the AWFC\n(Fig. 9a) did not increase as the MQI negative bay deep-\nened during Substorm B (Fig. 1). However, as previously\nexplained, Figs. 7 and 9 suggest that beyond 13:13 UT, peak\nvelocities within the AWFC had expanded equatorward of\nthe preferred range gate for the detection of F-region echoes\nvia 0.5-hop propagation. The KGS and TIGER radars had\nrotated to past magnetic midnight (\u223c02 MLT), near the east-\nern limit of AWFC occurrence. A second, stronger AWFC\nmay have developed at lower latitude, and at an earlier local\ntime. A third radar located further to the west (\u223c22 MLT)\nmay have observed a more intense AWFC during Substorm\nB.\nWe conclude the AWFC activity probably commenced\nnear substorm onset, and decayed near the end of recovery\nphase. Although the lack of continuity of the radar echoes\nin longitude, latitude, and time, make it difficult to be ab-\nsolutely certain, other events we have examined support this\nview. As mentioned, there is a possibility the peak velocities\nwithin the AWFC occurred at lower latitude and later times,\nas the magnetospheric polarisation fields migrated closer to\nEarth. This might explain why intense PJ\/SAIDs have been\nobserved at lower latitude during the recovery phase. The\nKGS and TIGER radars are limited to observing AWFCs\npoleward of\u223c62\u25e63. Clearly, more SuperDARN radars must\nbe deployed at lower latitudes than KGS and TIGER to de-\ntermine whether AWFCs are the same as PJ\/SAIDs.\nWe have compiled statistics on the occurrence of AWFCs\nobserved by TIGER during the year 2000, and they suggest\ntheir occurrence rate is very similar to the occurrence rate of\nsubstorms (Parkinson et al., 2004b). AWFCs are often syn-\nchronised to negative bays in the geomagnetic X-component\nmeasured at MQI. All of our results suggest that AWFCs\nare a fundamental aspect of substorms. In fact, in terms of\nelectric field enhancements, they are the dominant signature\nof substorms. They might even be another trigger for sub-\nstorms.\nJayachandran et al. (2003) discussed two substorms, iden-\ntifying POLAR UVI onset, GOES dipolarisation, and LANL\nparticle injection times. The POLAR UVI onsets were in the\npre-midnight ionosphere whereas the GOES and LANL ob-\nservations were at geosynchronous orbit. It is interesting that\nthe POLAR UVI onsets (ionospheric signatures) preceded\nthe GOES dipolarisation and LANL particle injection times\n(magnetospheric signatures) by several minutes. The PO-\nLAR UVI onsets also occurred near the equatorward bound-\nary of the ion auroral oval, exactly where AWFCs occur in\nTIGER observations.\nJayachandran et al. (2003) also found that dayside and po-\nlar cap convection velocities decreased at substorm onset,\nand hypothesised this was a consequence of current continu-\nity: given constant Chapman Ferraro and magnetosheath cur-\nrents, the Region 1 currents driving the polar cap convection\nmust diminish when the substorm current wedge intensifies.\nWe infer that a portion of the total electric potential differ-\nence must shift from across the polar cap to across AWFCs\nat substorm onset. Both of these results lend support to the\nfundamental role of AWFCs in substorms.\nAWFCs are enhanced westward drifts observed at auro-\nral and sub-auroral latitudes, but what distinguishes them\nfrom the enhanced return sunward flows within the main\ndusk convection cell? The answer is that AWFCs are the\nsubstorm-related structure within the return sunward flows\ndriven by polarisation fields as opposed to magnetic recon-\nnection, though reconnection may ultimately help to drive\ntheir formation.\nThe equi-potentials representing the return sunward flows\nin high-latitude convection models are smooth because they\naverage over the AWFC structure that nearly always exists in\nthis region. A cursory examination of DMSP SSIES data\nreveals profuse \u201cspiky\u201d velocity structure within the dusk\nsector auroral oval and sub-auroral ionosphere. Our HF\nbackscatter radar observations reveal the coincident velocity\npeaks are confined within narrow channels, well equatorward\nof the convection reversal boundary. Whilst many of the tran-\nsient flow bursts may be reconnection driven, the extended,\npersistent flow channels are an indication that polarisation\nfields also play an important role.\nIn the present event, TIGER observed a succession of\nwestward velocity enhancements expanding equatorward\nfrom near \u221271\u25e63, equatorward of the expected ionospheric\nfootprint of the open-closed magnetic field line boundary\n(Fig. 4b). Some of these velocity enhancements reached the\nlatitude of the main AWFC. They imply the Earthward mi-\ngration of radial electric field enhancements from within the\nopen-closed field line boundary towards the inner edge of the\nM. L. Parkinson: Interhemispheric asymmetries 1387\ncentral plasma sheet. These velocity enhancements may be\nthe signatures of magnetic reconnection. However, theories\nof PJ\/SAID formation (Anderson et al., 1993; De Keyser,\n1999; Galperin 2002) imply the Earthward migration of po-\nlarisation fields in association with particle injection fronts\n(cf. Fig. 2). More comprehensive observations combined\nwith better modelling will help clarify the relationship be-\ntween episodic reconnection and the formation of persistent\nAWFCs. The proposed THEMIS mission will deploy a fleet\nof five spacecraft in the magnetotail, and may help to clarify\nthis issue.\nImportantly, the present radar observations were of co-\nincident AWFC activity imbedded within the SAPS within\nmagnetically conjugate locations. The results summarised in\nFig. 9 suggest the variations in flow speed and channel lo-\ncation exhibited the same basic trends on longer time scales.\nHowever, the flow channel speeds were probably somewhat\nlarger in the Southern Hemisphere (Fig. 9a), and a detailed\nexamination of individual scans confirms the presence of sys-\ntematic differences in magnetic latitude (Fig. 9b). What geo-\nphysical factors might help to explain the asymmetries sum-\nmarised in Fig. 9?\nThe AACGM coordinate system does not include the ef-\nfects of magnetospheric currents which change the Earth\u2019s\nmagnetic field in complicated ways depending on the IMF\nhistory and substorm phase. Hence, in reality, a magnetic\nfield line tagged as 65\u25e63 in the Northern Hemisphere, may\nnot necessarily map to the magnetic field line tagged as 65\u25e63\nin the Southern Hemisphere. The ever-changing effects of\nmagnetospheric currents will be minor at mid-latitudes, but\nthey become very significant at auroral and polar cap lati-\ntudes.\nThe Tsyganenko 96 model (Tsyganenko, 1995; Tsyga-\nnenko and Stern, 1996) was used to trace magnetic field lines\nfrom representative auroral latitudes to the GSM equatorial\nplane using IMF By=10 nT and Bz=\u22125 nT. By=10 nT will\nexaggerate the By positive effect applicable to the events on\n30 November 2002. Figure 10 shows the GSM equatorial lo-\ncation of evening sector magnetic field lines with ionospheric\nlatitudes \u00b163\u25e63 and \u00b165\u25e63. The corresponding magnetic\nflux tubes reside in the location where magnetotail stretching\nand subsequent dipolarisation events start to become impor-\ntant. The AACGM latitudes near 64\u25e63 are not exactly conju-\ngate, with the discrepancy rapidly increasing between 63\u25e63\nand 65\u25e63. The magnetic field lines in the Southern Hemi-\nsphere map to greater radial distance in the equatorial plane.\nHence a given potential drop across the flux tube in the equa-\ntorial plane will map to a narrower latitude range, and thus\nproduce stronger electric fields, in the Southern Hemisphere.\nThis agrees with our observation of stronger drifts within the\nAWFC observed in the Southern Hemisphere.\nThe By component is well known to introduce asymme-\ntries into the high-latitude dayside convection pattern (Cow-\nley, 1981). The nightside convection pattern is also modified\nby By , and By might also produce an asymmetry in the loca-\ntions of conjugate AWFCs. Referring to Fig. 9b, the AWFC\nwas\u223c1\u25e63 further poleward in the Southern Hemisphere dur-\nFig. 10. Intersection of magnetic field lines with the GSM X\u2212Y\nplane at 12:00 UT on 30 November 2002. The field-line tracing was\nperformed using the Tsyganenko 96 model with IMF By=10 nT and\nBz=\u22125 nT. The results are shown for evening sector (pre-midnight)\nmagnetic field lines with ionospheric magnetic latitudes of \u00b163\u25e63\nand \u00b165\u25e63.\ning \u223c08:09 to 09:45 UT, and thereafter it was \u223c1\u25e63 further\npoleward in the Northern Hemisphere. By was more positive\nwhen the AWFC was further poleward in the Southern Hemi-\nsphere, and then By became more negative when the AWFC\nwas further poleward in the Northern Hemisphere.\nThe preceding result needs further testing, but it is consis-\ntent with the statistical results of Provan et al. (2004). They\ncalculated average SuperDARN convection velocities in the\nNorthern Hemisphere versus substorm phase. The largest re-\nturn sunward flows were observed just after substorm onset\nand equatorward of the convection reversal boundary when\nBy was negative. That is, AWFCs should be displaced fur-\nther poleward in the Northern Hemisphere under By negative\nconditions.\nOur argument that magnetospheric currents distort the\nmagnetic field line mapping probably does not explain all\nof the differences between the two AWFCs. Weimer et al.\n(1985) analysed electric field variations measured by the Dy-\nnamics Explorer (DE) 1 and 2 spacecraft located at altitudes\nabove 4500 km and below 900 km, respectively. Intervals\nwhen the two spacecraft were roughly conjugate were identi-\nfied, and the electric fields were compared. When DE 1 and 2\nwere on field lines outside the auroral oval, a Fourier analysis\nof the variations showed the magnetic field lines were equi-\npotentials across all spatial scales from large (\u223c1000 km) to\nsmall (<100 km). However, when the spacecraft were on\nfield lines inside the auroral oval, the small-scale variations\nobserved by DE 1 in the magnetosphere were 1\u20132 orders\nof magnitude stronger than those observed by DE 2 in the\nionosphere. Their analysis showed that ionospheric Pedersen\n1388 M. L. Parkinson: Interhemispheric asymmetries\nconductivity enhanced by particle-precipitation suppressed\nthe transmission of electric field turbulence from the mag-\nnetosphere to the ionosphere. Their analysis was also con-\nsistent with earlier theory invoking anomalous field-aligned\nresistivity, potential drops, and currents, as required for au-\nroral arcs.\nOur conjugate AWFC observations can also be explained\nby the results of Weimer et al. (1985). The basic electric field\nvariations at large spatial and temporal scales were in agree-\nment (Fig. 9), excluding systematic differences due to distor-\ntion of the magnetic field mapping in proximity to the sub-\nstorm dipolarisation region (Fig. 10). However, there were\nnumerous differences at shorter spatial and temporal scales.\nThese differences arose because the magnetic field lines were\nnot equi-potentials in proximity to regions of precipitation-\nenhanced Pedersen conductivity, such as the equatorward\nedge of the auroral oval. Indeed, this may be the underlying\nreason why magnetically conjugate observations have rarely\nshown impressive, detailed agreement.\nLastly, an important facet of the electrodynamics has thus\nfar been ignored, namely the dynamics and chemistry of the\nneutral atmosphere. This is beyond the scope of the present\nHF radar study, but we might expect the frequent, daily oc-\ncurrence of AWFC activity will drive a broad jet of westward\nneutral wind in proximity to the main ionospheric trough.\nThe neutral wind may be enriched with molecular species,\nthereby enhancing the recombination rate (Vlasov and Kel-\nley, 2003). This jet will penetrate to E-region altitudes during\ndisturbed conditions, and persist during quiet conditions.\nAcknowledgements.
