It is about what\nhappens when people who teach international law confront impending war, and\nabout the questions that are brought into focus at such a time. What is the public\nrole of a teacher of international law? Canwar be resisted through legal argument?\nHow does an anti-war intervention in the media relate to academic debates about\ninternational law? How does activism relate to critique?\nBy mid-February 2003 a second war on Iraq was becoming increasingly likely.\nIn the United Kingdom, debate about whether or not to go to war was being con-\nducted primarily at two levels: prudential (or strategic) and ethical.

A\nmillion people demonstrated in central London on 15 February. Opposition to the\nwar was becoming a major political issue for the government, with dissent from\nboth outside and within. In the midst of such mobilization, criticism quickly gave\nway to strategizing. Alongside the prudential and ethical debates, a legal debatewas\nbeginning to emerge, and it suddenly seemed important and urgent for those with\nspecialist knowledge in the field to intervene. A letter to a national newspaper was\nan obvious way of doing so.\nThe idea for our letter arose froma series of conversations among friends. Thepro-\nposed text was then circulated, negotiated, and finalized by e-mail. It was published\non 7March 2003, with 16 signatories. This is what we wrote:\nWe are teachers of international law.On the basis of the information publicly available\nthere is no justification under international law for the use of military force against\nIraq. The United Nations Charter outlaws the use of force with only two exceptions:\nindividual or collective self-defence in response to an armed attack and action author-\nized by the Security Council as a collective response to a threat to the peace, breach of\nthe peace or act of aggression. There are currently no grounds for a claim to use such\nforce in self-defence. The doctrine of pre-emptive self-defence against an attack that\nmight arise at some hypothetical future time has no basis in international law. Neither\nSecurity Council resolution 1441 nor any prior resolution authorizes the proposed use\nof force in the present circumstances.\nBefore military action can lawfully be undertaken against Iraq, the Security Council\nmust have indicated its clearly expressed assent. It has not yet done so. A vetoed\nresolution could provide no such assent. The PrimeMinister\u2019s assertion that in certain\ncircumstances a veto becomes \u2018unreasonable\u2019 and may be disregarded has no basis\nin international law. The United Kingdom has used its Security Council veto on 32\noccasions since 1945. Any attempt to disregard these votes on the ground that they\nwere \u2018unreasonable\u2019 would have been deplored as an unacceptable infringement of the\nUK\u2019s right to exercise a veto under United Nations Charter article 27.\nA decision to undertake military action in Iraq without proper Security Council au-\nthorization will seriously undermine the international rule of law. Of course, even\nwith that authorization, serious questions would remain. A lawful war is not neces-\nsarily a just, prudent or humanitarian war.\nProfessor Ulf Bernitz, Dr Nicolas Espejo-Yaksic, Agnes Hurwitz, Professor Vaughan\nLowe, Dr Ben Saul, Dr Katja Ziegler, University of Oxford\nProfessor James Crawford, Dr SusanMarks, Dr Roger O\u2019Keefe, University of Cambridge\nProfessor Christine Chinkin, Dr Gerry Simpson, Deborah Cass, London School of\nEconomics\nDrMatthew Craven, School of Oriental and African Studies\nProfessor Philippe Sands, RalphWilde, University College London\nProfessor Pierre-Marie Dupuy, University of Paris1\n1.

From one perspective, what was distressing\nabove all was the prospect of international law being flouted. Without clear Se-\ncurity Council authorization, there could be no plausible legal justification for\ngoing to war. From another perspective, the disturbing development was, on\nthe contrary, that the necessity of a \u2018second\u2019 Security Council resolution had be-\ncome too much of a fixation in public debates. Why should a single resolu-\ntion of that institution make all the difference? And if it does, should that not\nrather invite critical scrutiny of international law? From yet another perspect-\nive, provocation came from the way in which international law had become\nentangled in New Labour spin. The government had consistently stated its in-\ntention to act within the bounds of international law. But the public was\nnot getting the full story: the assurances that ministers and other senior govern-\nment officials were offering as to the legal rectitude of any eventual military action\nwere far too glib. From a further perspective, the point was simply to contribute to\nefforts to stop the war in whatever way one could. Here, the government\u2019s media\nmanipulation was actually rather welcome. Assurances yielded valuable rhetorical\nmileage, inasmuch as they could be used as the basis of a demand that the gov-\nernment adhere to its own professed commitment to comply with international\nlaw.\nAmong those who signed the letter, by no means everyone identified with all of\nthese perspectives. But all identified with at least one (and, more commonly, more\nthan one). Most importantly, all shared the sense that this was a moment when a\nteacher of international law had to speak out.\nBut speak out in what terms? One consequence of the letter\u2019s multiple author-\nship was a very narrow and constrained analysis. A number of the more nuanced\nlegal debates were elided; the wider institutional and legal critique fell away; and\nreference to problems under international humanitarian law disappeared. Thus,\nwe simply stated that the war would be illegal because there had been no Security\nCouncil resolution authorizing it, and because the coalition could not justify such\nan intervention under even relatively broad notions of self-defence. Of some con-\ntroversy was the addition of the final sentence to the effect that even a lawful war\nwould not necessarily be a \u2018prudent, just or humanitarian\u2019 one. For the proponents,\nthe inclusion of such a clause seemed especially significant. Among other things,\nit offered an exit route for criticism of the war project in the event of a \u2018second\u2019\nSecurity Council resolution being adopted. It also demonstrated that we were alert\nto the wider world of ethics and politics (though clearly it did so in a somewhat\nambiguous fashion, to the extent that our formulation appeared to presume \u2013 and\nhence confirm \u2013 that the lawyer\u2019s \u2018normal\u2019 posture is detachment from that world).\nOnce the text of the letter was finalized, it was circulated for signature. The cir-\nculation list was largely limited to thosewithin the letter-drafters\u2019 own institutions,\nor at any rate, their own cities.Withwar by this point imminent, and crucial parlia-\nmentary debates likely to be held the following week, wider participation was not\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\n366 MATTHEW CRAVEN, SUSAN MARKS, GERRY SIMPSON, AND RALPH WILDE\nsought; speedy publication seemed more important than a long list of signatories.\nThe letter was sent initially to The Times, which declined to publish it, and then to\nthe Guardian, which was interested. Faxed to 10 Downing Street, the letter could\nnowbe thebasis of a front-page story about international lawyerswarning thePrime\nMinister that there was \u2018no case for war\u2019. The story ran, and the letter appeared in\nthe paper\u2019s letters page, on 7March 2003.\nSo we had made our intervention. We had defended international law against\nthose who would degrade it. We had reasserted the centrality of the prohibition on\ntheuseof force in international relationswithin thecontemporary legal order.What\nwe had not done, however, was to give expression to our critical voice, our sceptical\nsensibility.Howwasit thatwewerenowinternational law\u2019searnestchampions? Had\nnotsomeofusbasedourworkontheeffort toknockinternational lawoff itspedestal,\nand expose its darker dimensions? Had we not routinely criticized sovereignty as\npurely formal, frequently oppressive, and lacking explanatory power? Yet here we\nfound ourselves invoking international law, andwith it state sovereignty, in defence\nof Iraq. More than that, we found ourselves replicating in the process the same\nManichean structure of argument we sought to challenge. They had hegemony; we\nhad sovereignty. They had the axis of evil; we had the sovereign equality of states.\nThey had politics; we had law. But then,with key figures in theUS administration so\napparently cynical about international law, andwith their supporters in Britain and\nelsewhere so focused on spin, didn\u2019t law really need championing? Surely this was\na moment when loyalists were required, not critics. We couldn\u2019t let Bush and Blair\nspeak the language of a corrupted legalism to us. It was time to reclaim the public\nspace for serious international legal argument by serious international lawyers.\nBut what would that ultimately mean? Could we seize the legal ground without\nsimultaneously being imprisonedwithin it? Howwere we to understandwhat was\ngoing on? Was this a case of critical sensibilities dulled by political thrill-seeking?\nA temporary and strategic embrace of the doctrinal? Or legalism\u2019s united front\nthreatening to dissolve in self-doubt?\n2.\nIn the period after 7March, the British government began to get increasingly defens-\nive about the consistency of the proposed war with international law. On 17March\nthe UK Attorney General (chief government law officer) took the unusual step of\nissuing a public statement (in the form of a written parliamentary answer) setting\nout a legal justification for the war.2 The statement was based on a more detailed\ndocument thatwas itself, as is usually the case, kept confidential. Thiswas big news,\nand for a time the question of legality was in the foreground of the war debate.\nThe statement was reportedly used by the government whips in an attempt to win\nround uncertainmembers of parliament in a House of Commons vote on thewar. It\nwas also cited by outspoken cabinet member Clare Short as one of the factors that\n2.

(Short later resigned, citing\nconcerns about the plans for postwar reconstruction and the apparent sidelining of\nthe United Nations.)\nAmong the signatories to the letter, the question of whether a \u2018response\u2019 to the\nAttorney General\u2019s statement should be made was raised. Three of the group met\nand prepared a draft, rebutting the points made in the statement. At this point,\nthen, we contemplated expanding our involvement from a one-off intervention to\nsomethingmore sustained. Our rebuttalwould turn the process into a conventional\nadversarial debate, in this case between academics and politicians: our letter \u2013 the\nAttorney General\u2019s statement \u2013 our response.\nAs one would expect, the reaction from the group as a whole was mixed. Just\nas people had different, sometimes mutually contradictory, reasons for signing the\noriginal letter, so that views on themerits of a second letter seem to reflect contrast-\ning positions about international law and the role of the legal academic in public\ndiscourse. Those united in their reluctance, for example, were divided in their un-\nderlying reasons for adopting this view. For some, there was no point entering into\nthe debate; our point had been made. Whether to intervene depended on whether\nanything thathadbeensaidoriginallyneededclarificationorelaboration.Forothers,\nthe very notion of having made an intervention had been troubling from the start,\nand with the debate now becoming relatively complex, we risked becoming even\nmore embroiled in a process of argumentation about which we remained doubtful.\nMoreover, insofar as the recourse to formalism had somehow been conscionable\nwhen war was being contemplated (on the basis that it might somehow contribute\nto efforts to stop the war), now that war was inevitable such a strategic reason fell\naway. Context was key, and themoment had passed.\nWe decided not to proceed with a collective response. Like the original decision\nto write a letter (and, perhaps, because of it) this decision was itself a form of\nintervention. Having placed ourselves as participants in the debate, our silence now\nresonated andbecame something aboutwhich to speculate.Wewere askedwhether\nwe had been won round by the arguments of the statement. One correspondent,\nassuming this had in fact been the case, commented bitterly that \u2018Short\u2019s syndrome\u2019\nseemed to be infectious.\nIfwewere reluctant towriteagain,our initial impulse to letter-writingwasclearly\nshared by some of our colleagues. On the heels of the Attorney-General\u2019s statement\ncame a letter to The Times from Professors Philip Allott and Alan Dashwood at\nCambridge, who wrote that\nthe present imbroglio in the Security Council is liable to lead some people to conclude\nthat theUN is now irrelevant. This risk has been increased bywhat some international\nlawyers who should know better are saying about the UN Charter rules on the use\nof force . . . Responsible international lawyers should see it as their task, not to rush\nto simplistic and out-dated judgements, but to do all they can to make a new and\nvery dangerous international reality conform to the precious spirit and purpose of the\nCharter system.3\n3. The Times, 19 March 2003, Features, 23.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\n368 MATTHEW CRAVEN, SUSAN MARKS, GERRY SIMPSON, AND RALPH WILDE\nWhereas this letter\u2019s message about international law was somewhat difficult\nto grasp (was this a defence of the planned action in Iraq? or was the concern\nmerely that we had been insufficiently sophisticated?), its condescending view of\nthose lawyers who took a contrary position was plain. And if the opaque nature\nof the substantive message might lead one to uncertainty about which individuals\nwere the target of criticism, the conclusion that it was those setting out the anti-\nwar case, including the Guardian letter signatories, was inescapable. The chiding\nremarks called into question both expertise (\u2018should know better . . . simplistic and\nout-dated judgements\u2019) and integrity (referring to the \u2018task\u2019 of \u2018responsible inter-\nnational lawyers\u2019). As well as addressing the general lay audience and invoking\nprofessional expertise as we (\u2018teachers of international law\u2019) had done, the letter\nalso pursued a certain form of academic critique aimed at professional colleagues.\nIn this letter and others like it, we were accused of a naive textualism in relation\nto the Charter. We had failed to see how much the world had changed since 1945,\n1989, or perhaps 2001. Good lawyers interpreted the Charter instrumentally and\npurposively; we had embraced a dullard\u2019s literalism. This controversy resembled, of\ncourse, virtually every debate anyone had ever had about the use of force under the\nCharter. The sense of de\u00b4ja` vuwas overwhelming \u2013 the temptation to fall into nostal-\ngic reminiscences about previous doctrinal battles over Entebbe (whatwas \u2018political\nindependence\u2019 anyway?) or Panama (a right to pro-democratic intervention?) was\neasily resisted, but it was hardly cheering to realize that instead of having transcen-\nded the debate we were embroiled in it . . . and as \u2018positivists\u2019.\nThings were becoming more complicated. Initially, the identity of the parti-\ncipants, the association with particular positions, and the location of the interven-\ntions were to be contrasted in a binary fashion: academics writing in newspapers,\ngovernment politicians issuing official statements. Now academics were arguing\namong themselves, and in the same medium. Moreover, the impulse to participate\nspread outside the narrow, and relatively formal,mediumof newspaper correspond-\nence to the news media more generally, as various international lawyers, including\nsome of the Guardian signatories, gave interviews and took part in television and\nradio debates.\nAlthough we were now placed in the same position as everyone else engaged\nin the public anti-war debate \u2013 politicians, activists, and so on \u2013 in espousing a\nparticular view within a broader expert community, our professional expertise led\nus to be treated as a special case. Lawyers, of course, are not only popularly presented\nas the guardians of a set of rules unknowable to the lay person \u2013 an idea on which\nour claim to have something worth reading about had been based \u2013 we are also\noftenpresentedasopportunists capableofholdingdifferent,mutuallycontradictory\npositions depending on the strategic needs of the time. Invocations of the old cliche\u00b4\nabout asking several lawyers the same question and getting different answers from\neach accompanied the shift in the public presentation of the question of law and\nthe war from \u2018lawyers claimwar is unlawful\u2019 to \u2018lawyers disagree about war against\nIraq\u2019.\nSuch challenges seemed to require thatwe embrace formalism evenmore tightly.\nBy setting out a legal case, our original intervention had presupposed the validity\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\n\u2018WE ARE TEACHERS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW\u2019 369\nof law\u2019s claim to determinacy; now we had to argue that a multiplicity of expert\nviews on the subject did not reflect international law\u2019s ability to mean all things to\nall people. The lawwas clear, and those who disagreed with us were wrong.\nAt the same time,however, just as indeterminacyassailedus fromtheoutside, am-\nbivalence was corroding our certainties from the inside. Like Robert Frost\u2019s liberals,\nwewere finding it difficult to take our own side in an argument. Invited on to panels\nto give an anti-war legal view,we repeatedly disappointed ourhosts and the anti-war\nsections of the audience who had put their faith in us as exponents of the case for\nan anti-hegemonic international law. Understandably enough, we were expected\nto maintain and carry forward the legalist challenge, to rebut authoritatively the\nAttorney General, and to express our general disquiet at the Bush administration\u2019s\nsubversion or denigration of international law (noting in passing the US rejection\nof the Kyoto Protocol, its repudiation of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, and its\nresistance to the International Criminal Court). That we did not do so \u2013 or at least,\nnot in the expectedmanner \u2013 seemed to leave those listening profoundly perplexed\n(had the right person been invited?).\nIn one such debate, one of us confessed to feelings of ambivalence aboutwhether\nin retrospect it had been right to oppose the war (by then under way), only to\nbe challenged by a member of the audience for \u2018seeming awfully sure about his\nambivalence\u2019. Images of mass graves, cheering crowds, and falling statues were\nbeginning to confirm earlier doubts. But perhaps we had now swapped one form\nof certainty for another. In another debate, panellists were invited to provide an\nassessment of the \u2018damage to international law\u2019 caused by the military action in\nIraq. Questioners wanted to know how the integrity of international law could\nbe restored. Through what arguments could the Attorney General\u2019s statement be\nrefuted? Bywhatmeans could legal challenge bemounted against the coalition? In\nwhat fora could Bush andBlair be criminally prosecuted? Whenone of us expressed\nmisgivings about the implicit vision here of international law as a redemptive force\nwhich could save the world if only it was allowed (or made) to operate properly,\nno one wanted to know. Likewise, the idea that, in depicting the war as the work\nof evil men who should be punished, the anti-war activists were mimicking the\nlogic of those they sought to oppose, simply substituting Bush and Blair for Saddam\nHussein and Osama bin Laden, had no resonance. Had we been hoist by our own\npetard?\nAt the same time, andnot surprisingly,wewere accusedof defendinga formalistic\nanda-historicalsovereignty. Inapublicmeetingconveneddaysaftertheintervention\nbegan, political scientists derided our legalism, our failure to grasp the changing\nworldaroundusandourblindness to thevirtuesof theBlair government\u2019s crusading\nhumanitarian spirit. There was something touching, but also dangerous, about this\nbookish international law of ours. A week or so later, two respected doctrinalists\nsloggeditoutbeforeLondon\u2019s \u2018greatandgood\u2019.Again, thequestions(bemused,world-\nweary, mildly exasperated), and indeed the introductory remarks (\u2018when lawyers\ndisagree, they get paid\u2019), signalled that enough had been heard from the lawyers.\nAll this bickering over vaguely worded \u2018law\u2019 was so familiar and so unhelpful. If for\ntheGuardian letter-writers legal argument had seemed away of avoiding the charge\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\n370 MATTHEW CRAVEN, SUSAN MARKS, GERRY SIMPSON, AND RALPH WILDE\nof fiddling while Rome burns, now legal argument appeared to be exposing those\ninvolved to precisely that charge.\n3.\nReflecting back on these events, it seems clear that, whatever value our letter may\nhavehad, italsocarrieddangersandpromptedmany,oftenuncomfortablequestions.\nThe various responseswe received and our own experiences after publication of the\nletter helped to clarify these, even if not to resolve them. Although there are others,\nten issues are worth highlighting.\n3.1. Personal gratification\nThe letter\u2019s publicationnodoubt affected its signatories indiverseways. Some spoke\nof ribbing by friends, parental pride, and the odd collegial lambasting (\u2018who do you\nthink you are?\u2019). Many received congratulatory e-mails and an unwonted number\nof calls from the press. So was the letter in the end just about personal gratification,\nabout promoting ourselves in the public domain, displaying expertise, acquiring\na war story? Clearly it was in part about these things, but could we refute the\naccusation that this was a self-seeking enterprise by observing that self-promotion\nafteralldoesnothavetooperatetotheexclusionofstrategy,andthatourintervention\nwas both? Or is that self-delusion? Does self-promotion in fact get in the way of\neffective action? At any rate, does the kind of self-promotion in which a critical\nlawyer might seek to engage \u2013 one that combines a desire for visibility with an\nidentity based onmarginality \u2013 get in the way of effective action?\n3.2. Expertise\nThe legal analysis presented in our letter was prefaced by a declaration of our status\nas teachers of international law. Were we right to invoke authority in this way?\nOn the one hand, one might say that people do in fact listen to what lawyers say\nabout law, just as they would listen to what a palaeontologist says about a fossil.\nEachwithin their own sphere . . . On the other hand, isn\u2019t this precisely an example\nof the politics of expertise that we constantly criticize? Aren\u2019t we reinforcing here\nthe idea that justice is something you know, and furthermore knowledge to which\nwe have privileged access, as opposed to something that gets defined and redefined\nin the crucible of social struggle? Or can we again content ourselves with the\nthought that the politics of expertise was being turned here to \u2018good\u2019 strategic\nends?\nMoreover, precisely whose authority and expertise was being invoked? The let-\nter was signed by academics at three elite universities \u2013 Cambridge, London, and\nOxford \u2013using academic titles (Professor, Dr)where applicable. A typical reaction in\nan e-mail from one colleague at a \u2018new\u2019 (former polytechnic) university in London\nthanked us formaking the intervention, but askedwhy people froma broader range\nof institutions were not asked to sign. A question speculating on the reason for\nthis \u2013 \u2018do new universities dilute the effect?\u2019 \u2013 serves as a reminder that our letter\nhad not only appeared to assume the validity of a conceptual system that some of us\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\n\u2018WE ARE TEACHERS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW\u2019 371\nusually sought to interrogate; in the choice of signatories it also risked reinforcing\ninstitutional hierarchies within legal academia.\n3.3. Formalism\nWhat, then, was the strategy pursued through this letter? What could formalism\nachieve? At one level it seemed an obvious rhetorical tool. Since Tony Blair had\npromised in Parliament to act at all times consistently with international law, fram-\ning our arguments in terms of holding Blair to his own stated commitments just\nseemed to make sense as rhetoric. At the same time, however, there were some\nequally obvious dangers.\nIn the first place, a UN Security Council resolution authorizing the war might\nhave been passed. We tried to reserve our position through the last paragraph of\nour letter, in which we stated that even a lawful war was not necessarily just,\nprudent, or humanitarian. But that was clearly weak. For those of us who believed\nthat the military action then proposed was indeed unjust, imprudent, and anti-\nhumanitarian,was it right to run the risk that our legal argumentsmight ultimately\ncome to undermine our political goals?\nSecond, there was the danger of valorizing the currency. Why were we encour-\naging faith in international law as an agent of justice and peace whenwe know that\nit helps to legitimate oppression and justify violence, and we devote a considerable\nportion of our energies to showing how? One response to this might be that there\nis surely not a coherent, unified currency here. International law also has the po-\ntential to help those trying to resist oppression and curb violence. In other words,\nit works in more than one dimension, and so therefore must we. Or is this just\nrationalization?\nFinally, there is the question of the effects of a turn to formalism for ourselves,\nour identity and solidarity as critical scholars, and our capacity for solidarity and\nco-operative activity with others.Were we talking down to the addressees of our re-\nmarks, and failing to share with them our insight that international law is not\nnecessarily the beneficent force they take it to be? Or could we assume they\nalready had their own grounds for scepticism about international law, and just\nwanted to be better informed about how it could be used to help stop the war\nin Iraq?\n3.4. Anti-formalism\nOnce the war began, our attention turned to the question of how international law\nhad been used to justify it.We started to talk about indeterminacy and ambivalence\nand ambiguity. We reflected on all the various legal arguments that had been ad-\nvanced for and against the war and tried to analyze what had made some kinds of\nlegal argument more popularly compelling than others.\nWe also tried to theorize what was going on, and to retrieve the political within\nthe technical: we spoke in critical terms about the lawwhich governs the conduct of\nwarfare, about theway inwhichconcepts suchasproportionality,militarynecessity,\nand distinction, not to mention the very term humanitarian law, belong with the\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\n372 MATTHEW CRAVEN, SUSAN MARKS, GERRY SIMPSON, AND RALPH WILDE\nlarger processes throughwhichwar gets sanitized and brutality condoned. Later on,\nonce the war had ended, we also talked about international law\u2019s constitutive role\nin relation to the colonization of Iraq, about how the Fourth Geneva Convention\nworked in various ways to legitimate the profoundly undemocratic processes of\nreconstruction by then under way, and so on.\nWhat was striking, however, was that no one seemed to want to hear this. If we\nhad been unsure before as to whether people had exaggerated faith in international\nlaw, now it seemed absolutely clear that they did. Were we reaping what we had\nsown? Orwere theactivists andotherswithwhomwewerediscussing thesematters\nright to keep us focused on international law\u2019s emancipatory potentials?\n3.5. Civil disobedience\nPeople who had been charged with criminal damage in connection with efforts to\nstop military action then approached us with a request to act as expert witnesses\nas to the illegality of the war. Some of us have agreed to this. Should we have done\nso? On the one hand, why not? No one is forcing us to choose between making\narguments in terms of international law and opposing the idea that international\nlaw provides answers to the problems we face. On the other hand, and especially\nin the light of the experiences just mentioned, were we simply failing to learn our\nlesson?\n3.6. War crimes\nAt the same time, the air was thick with talk of criminal proceedings of a very\ndifferent sort: trials for crimes against humanity committed by SaddamHussein and\nother Iraqi officials and trials for war crimes committed by American and British\nofficers and even by the two leaders Bush and Blair.What attitude were we to adopt\nto these proposals? In an immediate sense, as noted above, there is an obvious and\ndisturbing symmetrybetween theactivists\u2019 call to tryBushandBlair and the rhetoric\nused to justify the war in the first place: in both cases the central idea is that this is\nall about the actions of an evil clique, or even a single evil man.\nMore broadly, there are all the questions that perplex us generally about war\ncrimes trials: what purpose is served by such trials? Do they just give the accused\nan exceptionally strong platform from which to tell his or her self-justifying story?\nDo they privatize and individualize responsibility for that which should rather\nbe seen as public and systemic? By establishing criminal responsibility for some\nforms of violence, do they help to sanctify the idea that other forms of violence and\nsuffering are acceptable, or at any rate unavoidable? In the end, then, shouldwe not\nview international criminal justicemuch as some view national criminal justice, as\nmore amatter of discipline than of justice, more amatter of asserting authority and\nmonopolizing virtue than protecting people and reducing insecurity? Or are those\nseeking punishment right? We might squirm at the activists\u2019 moral certainty and\nrighteous indignation, but what if that too should be understood in strategic terms?\nCould it be that absolutism is the price of effective action?\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\n\u2018WE ARE TEACHERS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW\u2019 373\n3.7. The end of international law?\nFor every letter to the paper arguing that the war was legal or illegal, there was\nanother arguing that might makes right: international law is simply irrelevant.\nThis is, of course, a longstanding theme of both left and right commentary. For\nexample, Chomksy has consistently argued that for the United States \u2018Diplomacy\nand international law have always been regarded as an annoying encumbrance.\u20194\nDoes the 2003 Iraqwar thenmark the point atwhich aUS administration,with help\nfrom the British, finallymanaged to shrug off diplomacy (in the shape of the United\nNations) and international law? Or is this just what Richard Perle and others would\nlike us to think?\nClearly the US and UK governments have in fact been careful to explain their\nconduct in international legal terms, andhaveput considerable energy into Security\nCouncil negotiations. Are people like Chomsky falling for an ideology that charac-\nterizes the UN and international law as ineffectual, as ameans of ensuring that they\nbecome so? Alternatively, are such people falling for an ideology that characterizes\ntheUSasdesirousof ensuring that international lawbecomes ineffectual? Given that\npower isneversustainedbyforcealone,butalwaysthroughprocessesof legitimation\nand co-optation, it seems difficult to imagine a better way of securing hegemonic\npower than through a systempremised on the formal equality of states.What, then,\nif the dark secret at the heart of the Bush administration is that the leading figures\nwithin it are international law\u2019s most ardent supporters and patrons?\n3.8. Historicity\nTo those who argue that the 2003 Iraq war (or indeed some earlier event) marks\nthe point at which international law was finally shrugged off, history is a series of\ntests which international law either passes or (as in this case) fails. From another\nperspective, the reverse is the case: international law is itself the test of history.\nQuite clearly, both positions are problematic, inasmuch as both forget or at any rate\nobscure international law\u2019s own historicity. We need to resist this reifying gesture\nand sustain a sense of the character of international law as dynamic and contestable.\nWementioned earlier the risk that a UN Security Council resolution authorizing\nthe war might have been passed, and asked whether we were right to run this risk.\nThe real question is perhaps why, instead of making the arguments we did, we did\nnot invite public reflection on the fact that all it would have taken to make the war\nlegal was Security Council authorization. In fact, as indicated earlier, that was one\nof the concerns behind the letter. Some of us were worried about the way the issue\nof whether the war was legal was eclipsing the issue of whether the war was a good\nidea. We wanted people precisely to consider the possibility that, if all it took was\nSecurity Council authorization tomake thewar legal, perhaps therewas something\nwrong with international law. How then are we to understand the process through\nwhich this aspect got lost?\n4. N. Chomsky,Deterring Democracy (1992), 3.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\n374 MATTHEW CRAVEN, SUSAN MARKS, GERRY SIMPSON, AND RALPH WILDE\n3.9. Crises\nIn an article on the Kosovo crisis Hilary Charlesworth makes some valuable ob-\nservations about the preoccupation which international legal scholars have with\ncrises.5 Our conferences, discussiongroups, articles, andbooksaremostly concerned\nwith extraordinary events, outbreaks of violence, international incidents. As Char-\nlesworth explains, this promotes attention to so-called high politics or dramatic\naccidents, and encourages us to neglect long-term trends and structural problems.\nPoverty, lack of access to clean water, excessive military spending, HIV\/AIDS, and\nviolenceagainstwomenareamongtheprincipal crisesofour times, yet these remain\nat the margins of our scholarly debates. In intervening as we did in the Iraq \u2018crisis\u2019,\nwere we fuelling this process by which the scandals of everyday life get normalized\nand even removed from view? Could we console ourselves with the thought that\nwe alsowrite about poverty and the rest? Or does this again not work?\n3.10. Lessons for critical practice\nCrises, then, are problematic, but one thing that this experience brought home to us\nis that context counts. The procedures of a critical practice cannot be specified ab-\nstractly or in advance, becausewhat is ideological in one context is not so in another.\nSo, for example, the arguments made to justify the war were that international law\nis indeterminate, that international law on this matter is very complex, and that\ninternational law should not be approached with excessive formality.\nIndeterminacy, complexity, and anti-formalism seemrather familiar fromcritical\nscholarship, but this is surely a reminder that we cannot regard them as having\nsome critical essence any more than we can regard their antitheses as having some\nideological essence. As Slavoj Zizek puts it in his work on ideology: \u2018When some\nprocedure is denounced as \u201cideological par excellence\u201d, one can be sure that its\ninversion isno less ideological.\u20196 Hegoeson to showhowideology canwork through\narguments from both necessity and contingency, both simplicity and complexity,\nand so on.\nYet if formalism can be critical too, that does not, of course, make the dangers we\nhave highlighted go away. Commenting on the danger that, depending on events\nin the Security Council, our legal advocacy might end up being turned against our\npolitical goals, some interlocutorswonderedwhether thatwasnot after all the point\nof the whole critical enterprise in the first place. Maybe. Or does the distinctiveness\nof the critical enterprise lie in the fact that it raises these issues, it prompts these\nanxieties, but precisely does not resolve them?\n5. H.
