Introduction\nThe development of the social capital literature in social science, economics,\nand other related disciplines provides a new perspective to understanding\nthe social foundation of human actions. Social capital, understood as \u2018the\ninformation, trust and norms of reciprocity inhering in one\u2019s social network\u2019\n(Woolcock, 1998: 153), appears to explain differences in governance (Putnam\net al., 1993; Putnam, 2000), efficiency in human capital formation (Coleman,\n*Correspondence to: Dr Joan Costa-Font, LSE Health, Houghton Street, London WC2A 2AE, UK.\nEmail: j.costa-font@lse.ac.uk\n413\nHealth Economics, Policy and Law (2008), 3: 413\u2013427\n\u00aa Cambridge University Press 2008 doi:10.1017\/S1744133108004635\n1988), the success of development strategies in low income country contexts\n(Grootaert and van Bastelaer, 2001), and the economic success of migrant\ngroups in the USA (Portes, 1998). Only recently research has focused on the\nrole of social capital as a key variable in understanding health production\n(Moore et al., 2006; Shortt, 2004; Mladovsky and Mossialos, 2008). Accord-\ningly, the articles in this special issue offer further evidence suggesting that\nlevels of social activity in a group (collective social capital), as well as people\u2019s\nperceptions of being part of a wider community, social networks, and psychoso-\ncial trust (individual social capital) influence either health-related behaviour\nand\/or the use of health care. However, as Scheffler (2008) argues, it is apparent\nthat the mechanisms leading to the formation of social capital and how this\ninfluences health are still very much in a black box. There is therefore a need\nto conceptualize the existing evidence further. This short article will discuss\nhow social capital might explain health outcomes and health care use drawing\nfrom the economics and social science literature and in particular the studies\nincluded in this special issue. Specifically, the discussion focuses on linkages\nbetween interdependence in health preferences and the way this might affect\nhealth-related behaviour, through social capital. Additionally, methodological\nproblems are highlighted and possible ways forward suggested.\nAs demonstrated by the set of studies included in this special issue, there\nappears to be an association between social capital and health, but current\nknowledge does not permit the full development of a model to explain the\ncausal mechanisms that account for the observed heterogeneity. An attempt to\nexplain this heterogeneity can be found in Laporte et al. (2008), where diver-\nging individual and community level effects of social capital on health care util-\nization are reported. Interestingly the authors suggest that each form of social\ncapital is likely to operate through a different mechanism. On the one hand,\nindividual social capital perhaps serves an enabling role by improving access\nto health care (e.g. transportation services), while community social capital\nserves to obviate some physician visits that may involve counselling\/caring ser-\nvices most important to seniors. Jusot et al. (2008) find an association between\npsychosocial resources and self-assessed health, mainly by way of sense of con-\ntrol at work, but unfortunately the type of analysis does not allow any conclu-\nsions about a specific causal mechanism to be drawn. They concede that their\nfindings could be explained by a \u2018pessimistic bias\u2019 (the same individuals tend\nto pessimistically assess both their health status and their capacity to muster\nsocial resources). Iversen (2008) finds that voting participation in local elections\nis positively associated with self-assessed health but finds mixed results for\nreligious activity and sports organizations. While the author hypothesizes this\nmay suggest the welfare state diminishes the effect of structural community\nsocial capital, as represented by voluntary organizations, on health, the author\nalso concedes the data and statistical methods used in the study can only claim\nassociation rather than causality.\n414 J O A N C O S T A - F O N T A N D P H I L I P A M L A D O V S K Y\nFolland (2008) in this issue is concerned more specifically with causal\nmechanisms and develops a theoretical interpretation of how economic models\nshould conceptualize social capital as determining health production. Impor-\ntantly, Folland (2008) identifies key behavioural mechanisms to explain how\nthe availability of information, stress reduction effects, and the importance of\nresponsibilities to oneself and others impact on risk attitudes and people\u2019s sense\nof self-control, all these factors standing out as potential causal mechanisms\nlinking social capital and health. Hence, social capital could be argued to affect\nhealth through the related concept of self-valuation of life in the health econom-\nics literature, whereby the individual serves as a public good to many other peo-\nple who value him. The existence of these interpersonal bonds provides utility,\nand the value of health is increased by them, according to Folland. By this logic,\nhe argues, when risk of death stems from behaviour such as smoking, social\ncapital increments provide added incentive to quit the behaviour.\nIn this commentary, as well as drawing upon evidence from the papers\nreported in this special issue, we attempt to provide additional insights, links,\nand explanations of the likely (behavioural) mechanisms that underpin the con-\nnection between social capital and health. We argue that several mechanisms\nare largely unexplored in the social capital literature and point out that develop-\nments in the broader economics and social science literature have already begun\nto elucidate some approaches that might help explain the health and social\ncapital relationship. In particular, we argue that an important influence mediat-\ning the relationship between social capital and health behaviour is the so-called\n\u2018social formation of health preferences and constraints\u2019, overlooked by Folland\nand others. Namely, we propose that the association between social capital and\nhealth may be caused by interdependence in how individuals in the first place\nperceive and also respond to common health risks by adopting protective or\npreventive measures. We go on to argue that this association is itself mediated\nin part by cultural transmission. Similarly, another form of social creation of\npreferences lies in the social formation of individual identities that condition\nindividual actions and preferences (Akerlof and Kranton, 1999). This hypo-\nthesis is supported, for example, by research suggesting that social interactions\nmight enable individuals to compare themselves with each other and perhaps\nencourage behaviours that might prevent obesity (Costa-Font and Gil, 2004).\nOther research has suggested that clear and consistent stigmatization, and in\nsome cases discrimination, can be documented towards obese individuals in\nthe field of employment, education, and health care (Puhl and Brownell,\n2001), again a potential source of interdependence of preferences.\nEvidence pointing towards the social formation of health preferences, we\nargue, calls for further re-formulation of conventional tradition of demand\nand production of health. Classical demand for health theory has advocated\nthe idea that individuals, through their actions \u2013 which in turn are determined\nby exogenously given preferences and time and resource constraints \u2013 affect\nSocial capital and health preferences 415\nthe stock of health capital (Grossman, 1972). This underlying framework\nassumes that health status is to a large extent subject to individual control\n(not counting random shocks and genetic endowments along with the inevitable\ndepreciation through age)1 rather than influenced by socially structured factors\nthat pose constraints on behaviour (e.g. binge drinking) and influence the utility\nof certain health behaviours (e.g. social smoking). The so-called traditional\napproach to health production draws upon an old formulation of neoclassical\neconomics that did not incorporate social interactions in the formation of pre-\nferences for health. The critique of classical demand for health theory runs\nparallel to the social science debate over what Hart (1986) has distinguished\nas the individualistic and the structural approach. Most individual-level studies\nexamine only individual-level determinants of health, though it is increasingly\napparent that there is a need to identify and disentangle structural \u2018social\neffects\u2019 from pure individual influences. For example, besides the well-known\nexamples of social smoking and alcohol consumption, social science has long\ndemonstrated that whether certain types of food are consumed or not is cultur-\nally driven (Caplan, 1997). Another important social effect is that of risk\nperceptions. There is qualitative evidence to suggest that how people perceive\nthe risks of health-related behaviour along with their preferences for risky pro-\nspects is socially formed (Caplan, 2000). A clear example where social context\nappears to be highly influential is that of mental health, given that mental dis-\norders are largely sensitive to environmental factors. Durkheim\u2019s classic study\nof suicide (Durkheim, 1897) was one of the earliest to highlight the role of eco-\nlogical and environmental effects (mainly social integration) on mental health.\nContemporary studies point towards similar effects. For example, Propper\net al. (2005) observed a relationship between neighbourhood and levels and\nchanges in mental health in England.\nIn light of what is known about the structural dimension of health produc-\ntion, in dealing with explaining the mechanisms whereby social capital influ-\nences health, it would seem reasonable to take the social creation of health\nbehaviour into account. However, many studies of social capital continue to\nemploy only individualistic demand functions. For example, while Folland\n(2008) in this issue develops an interesting argument about the social incentives\nfor improved health behaviour, his analysis remains within the conventional\nindividualistic health production model. Hence, our argument here points out\nfurther structural linkages that have been largely left unaddressed in the literat-\nure on social capital and health and suggests techniques for measuring the\neffects of these linkages.\n1 According to this model, differences in health status across individuals result from personal charac-\nteristics and behaviour, which arguably constitutes an intrinsic natural endowment. In this perspective,\neach individual, or agent, is conceptualized as a decision maker endowed with preferences, forming\nexpectations, and facing constraints\n416 J O A N C O S T A - F O N T A N D P H I L I P A M L A D O V S K Y\nIndeed, critics of social capital theory have argued that despite the desire to\nincorporate social factors into economic models, methodological individualism\nstill forms the cornerstone of social capital theory. This Fine (2001) defines\nas \u2018an understanding of society from the perspective of aggregating over the\nbehaviour of individuals\u2019. Seen this way, social capital theory is portrayed\nas reductionism of the social to individual rational choice in response to market\nimperfections. Important concepts in social science that are not normally encap-\nsulated within the tradition of methodological individualism are overlooked.\nOne implication of this has been the conceptualization of social capital as\ntangibly productive (more social capital being associated with increased produc-\ntivity), though other indirect effects on variables that can enhance productivity\nare recognized in the economics literature. This has obscured the potentially\nnegative effects of social capital, discussed in more detail below.\nIn the next section, we develop the concept of interdependence between\nindividuals in their health preferences and behaviours and its relation to social\ncapital as immediate mechanisms to explain the association between health\nand social capital. We do so by drawing on the literature on endogenous effects\nand cultural transmission. The role of identity and the social multiplier effect\nis also discussed. Finally, we devote a section to a discussion of how this\nnew perspective can potentially affect the main debates in contemporary health\npolicy.\n2. Sources of Interdependence in health preferences and behaviour\n2.1 Interdependence and social interactions\nThe idea of interdependent preferences has long been sustained not only in\ndisciplines such as sociology and anthropology (perspectives which are not ela-\nborated in this article) but also from the very beginning in the economic literat-\nure initiated by Veblen (1934) and Duesenberry (1949) which pointed towards\nthe role of demonstration effects and conspicuous consumption. However, only\na few works (for example Becker (1974)) initially referred to the need for social\ninteractions to be explicitly acknowledged besides interdependency that already\ntakes place in markets. Furthermore, Pollack (1976) introduced the idea of\ninterdependent preferences in consumer behaviour. Other similar economic\nmodels are: spatial dependency (Case, 1991); Schelling\u2019s (1978) critical mass\nhypothesis; the bandwagon effect (Leibenstein, 1950); \u2018conformity\u2019 (Bernheim,\n1994); and endogenous social effects (Manski, 1993, 2000). Similarly, social\nlearning models suggest that people infer \u2018truth\u2019 from the behaviour of others\n(Ellison and Fudenberg, 1993). The importance of social context and social\ndependence has only recently been empirically tested in econometric models\nusing spatial econometrics (Case, 1991; Costa-Font and Moscone, 2008). For\nexample, consumption models find that social influence can take place in the\nSocial capital and health preferences 417\nprocess of internalization of an effect, its identification, and compliance with a\ndecision already made (Yang and Allenby, 2003).\nThese and other econometric models and techniques could potentially be\ndrawn upon by social capital researchers to take into account the effect of inter-\ndependent preferences and help overcome limitations in social capital research.\nHere we focus on the work of Manski (1993, 2000) who distinguishes three dif-\nferent effects that could give rise to social influences that transform preferences,\nexpectations, and behaviours. He argued that in observing that members of a\ngroup behave similarly we might encounter correlated effects due to shared\ninstitutional and individual characteristics (which arise due to common con-\nstraints on individuals such as a common past experience, exposure to similar\nrisk regulations, the influence of media and information campaigns etc), contex-\ntual or exogenous effects where behaviour varies with characteristics that derive\nfrom outside the reference group (for example varying behaviour being asso-\nciated with varying levels of income or education within a group) or endogen-\nous effects whereby the behaviour of individuals varies with the behaviour or\nexpectations of other members of the group.2 Endogeneous effects lead to\nwhat is coined as the \u2018social multiplier\u2019, where for example a change in an\nagent\u2019s action might affect his\/her own health along with that of another\nthrough social influence (Glaeser et al., 2003). The argument developed\nin this article about the importance of interdependent preferences in health is\nconceptually parallel to Manski\u2019s model of endogenous effects.\nManski (1993) argues that the association between the three different effects\nmay lead to an inability to identify the structural parameters of a model seeking\nto understand the channels through which society affects the individual. This, he\npoints out, has negative implications for policy formulation, since it becomes\nunclear which effects have resulted in any given observed outcome. Manski\n(1993) is mainly concerned with modelling endogenous effects and argues that\nwhen using individual data one of the problems with the incorporation of endo-\ngenous effects into econometric models is the so-called \u2018reflection problem\u2019,\nwhereby aggregate behaviour simultaneously determines and is determined by\nindividual behaviour. Other problems associated with modelling endogenous\neffects include defining a specific \u2018group\u2019 in which endogenous effects operate\nand identifying the relevant (possibly psychosocial) influence responsible for the\nsocial multiplier. Accordingly, it must be recognized that it is indeed difficult to\nensure that all correlation effects are identified, so that correlation between\neach health input and the individual error terms can be expected to remain.\nIt is striking that the problems outlined byManski in seeking to econometrically\nmodel the channels through which society affects the individual could also be said\n2 Typically one possibility to measure social interaction effects is either by using lagged group effect or\nalternatively by using other indicators of central tendency besides the mean, such as the median (Manski,\n2000).\n418 J O A N C O S T A - F O N T A N D P H I L I P A M L A D O V S K Y\nto broadly affect social capital studies, which have been largely unable to elucidate\nthe causal mechanisms that lead from the formation of social capital to health\nproduction and, we argue, have overlooked endogenous effects and the reflection\nproblem. Manski (1993) proposes solutions to the reflection problem. Economet-\nric tests and controls for \u2018within and between group\u2019 analysis, along with instru-\nmental variable approaches and natural or randomized experiments (Case and\nKatz, 1991) show that the reflection problem can be circumvented by improved\nquality data, which is becoming increasingly available. This article proposes that\nsocial capital studies would also benefit from drawing on and adapting such\nconcepts and econometric techniques to further develop the existing evidence on\nthe relationship between social capital and health. For example, studies of social\ncapital have not fully accounted for social multiplier effects and would benefit\nfrom greater interaction with the (albeit limited) literature which explores social\nmultiplier effects and health \u2013 see for example Cultler and Glaeser (2006) who\nfind clear evidence of the social multiplier in the impact of smoking bans. More\nbroadly, we argue there is a need for social capital research to take into account\nthe social and cultural formation of health preferences through endogenous effects.\nPossible avenues for further research are proposed below.\n2.2 Cultural transmission in the formation of\nendogenous effects\nThis article has argued that not considering interdependent preferences or\nendogenous effects can significantly bias health production estimates. In reformu-\nlating the traditional health production approach and seeking to understand the\ninfluence of endogenous effects, we have pointed to the need to identify the relev-\nant (possibly psychosocial) influence responsible for the social multiplier. Inspired\nby the model of \u2018cultural transmission\u2019 developed by Bisin and Verdier (2000),\nit can be argued that preferences for health and health care, like preferences for\nother goods, are influenced by cultural transmission. According to the cultural\ntransmission model, demand for health is partly determined by vertical transmis-\nsion (intergenerational effects) and partly by horizontal transmission (contempor-\naneous influences) of health-related preferences. That is, parental and family\nenvironment determine individuals\u2019 preferences for food, health care use, and\nacquisition of health information, along with other non-tangible determinants\nsuch as optimism and risk aversion through the mechanism of parental altruism.\nSimilarly, the cultural transmission model suggests that the individual\u2019s social\nenvironment matters in the formation of preferences, including his\/her preferences\nfor health, through the mechanism of cultural adaptation and imitation from\npeers, society, and role models. Accordingly, one might well speculate that these\nmechanisms explain the association between social capital and health.\nThere have been some social capital studies which have taken the transmis-\nsion of norms into account. Taking the example of smoking, the results of a\nSocial capital and health preferences 419\nstudy showing that the proportion of community social capital attributable to\nreligious groups is inversely and strongly related to the number of cigarettes\nthat smokers consume (Brown et al., 2006) are explained by the authors as\nbeing caused by strong non-smoking norms that exist in most religious groups.\nThey argue that these norms would affect both smokers within the groups as\nwell as those who come in contact with the groups. The authors argue that their\nfindings suggest that attention to changing the smoking norms in voluntary\norganizations may be an effective approach to tobacco control.\nSince the study includes individuals aged 18 and over the role of vertical\ntransmission (namely parents\u2019 influences on children) is not immediately relev-\nant, but it could be argued that the study is an example of community-level\nhorizontal transmission (i.e., peer and community effects) of health preferences\nthrough cultural and social norms that lead to imitation and community\nenforcement. Further development of the econometric model would be needed\nto ascertain whether the transmission of smoking norms is indeed the explanat-\nory factor. An additional explanation is that the results might reflect the trans-\nmission of beliefs, which are also arguably socially formed. Indeed, Cutler and\nGlaeser (2006) show that beliefs about the negative health effect of smoking\ncreates 25\u201350% of the difference between US and Europe smoking patterns,\nas opposed to price and other socioeconomic and demographic variables.\nAssuming that beliefs also operate through vertical transmission where learning\ntakes place between generations, an early commencement of anti-smoking\ninformation campaigns is likely to be effective.\nThe cultural transmission approach could also be used to develop further\nconfirmatory empirical evidence to explain the negative effect of social capital,\nevidenced by a study suggesting that the obesity \u2018epidemic\u2019 in the United States\nhas spread from person to person in a manner reminiscent of viral infections\n(Christakis and Fowler, 2007), so that interacting with relatively fat people\nhad the effect of making people fatter. This raises a problem with social capital\nstudies related to the nature of the (substitution\/complementary) relationship\nbetween social capital and other inputs in the health production function\nas raised by Folland (2008) in this issue. If the relationship is of complementar-\nity, then more social capital would be expected to increase health no matter\nwhat. This follows Coleman\u2019s view of social capital as \u2018productive, making\npossible the achievement of certain ends that in its absence would not be\npossible\u2019 (Coleman, 1988: S98). However, this view overlooks the importance\nof the transmission of social norms, which might be positive or negative. For\nexample, research into social capital in US immigrant groups revealed\nthat the same attributes of the normative structure (trust, social support, sanc-\ntions etc) that made the accumulation of human and economic capital possible\nin some groups were in other groups unproductive, for example by permitt-\ning free-riding on communal resources by less diligent members of the group,\nderiding efforts to study and work hard, or cutting off sources of information\n420 J O A N C O S T A - F O N T A N D P H I L I P A M L A D O V S K Y\n(Portes and Sensenbrenner, 1993). The conceptualization of social capital as the\ncultural transmission of social norms therefore puts into question the concept of\nsocial capital as solely productive and engenders an alternative view of social\ncapital that seeks to understand how social structures and norms promote or\nconstrain productive behavior.\nThere may be many other ways to conceptualize the relevant influence\nresponsible for the social multiplier. Interdependent preferences or endogenous\neffects as concepts could also operate through social identity, where the import-\nance of social formation of health preferences and production lies in the environ-\nment and the resulting social identity which affect the constraints, expectations,\nand\/or preferences of other agents in the production of health (Manski, 2000).\nFor example, empirical evidence indicates that negative body image is linked\nto depression along with low self-esteem, and poor health habits (Goodman\nand Whitaker, 2002). Accordingly, health-related behaviour might be socially\ndetermined in part through the influence of individual\u2019s self-image or self-\nacceptance in each social environment. This implies that the violation of or dam-\nage to each individual\u2019s desired self-image might lead to anxiety, unease, and ulti-\nmately depression through mechanisms such as social norms and prevailing\ncultural values. Conceptually, the mechanisms of identity could be usefully coun-\nterbalanced with various features of social capital such as proximity so that the\ninfluence of social interactions on identity can be expected to be larger when\n(groups of) individuals are socially and territorially closer to each other.\n3. Implication for interdisciplinary health policy debates\nThis article has sought to point out that the role of the social formation of health-\nrelated preferences and risk behaviours in determining health outcomes has been\noverlooked in studies of social capital and health. Arguments for the importance\nof the social formation of preferences and risk behaviours has waxed and waned\nin heath policy debates. Early social epidemiological studies on the effect of social\nnetworks on health conducted in the USA and Scandinavia the 1960s found\na negative correlation between social integration (the number and frequency\nof social relationships) and mortality, controlling for a variety of variables includ-\ning health behaviours (House et al., 1988). The results led House et al. (1988) to\ndownplay the importance of risk behaviours and to argue that \u2018social relation-\nships, or the relative lack thereof, constitute a major risk factor for health \u2013\nrivalling the effects of the well-established risk factors such as cigarette smoking\u2019.\nThe dominant explanation for the findings was not related to the concept of\ninterdependent health preferences, but rather focused on the idea that \u2018social sup-\nport\u2019 improved health through emotional well-being and self-esteem, help with\ntangible needs such as errands, help with making choices, and provision of\ninformation (Berkman and Glass, 2000).\nSocial capital and health preferences 421\nSince the 1980s, the debate into the social determinants of health has been\npropelled in a different direction by demonstrating the links between socio-\neconomic inequality and health. The highly influential Black Report published\nin England revealed a step-wise socioeconomic gradient in health (Townsend\net al., 1988). In the 1990s, social epidemiologists continued to find evidence\nof the socioeconomic gradient in health (Wilkinson, 1992; Kaplan et al.,\n1996; Kennedy et al., 1996). In many countries, such findings have supported\nalternative approaches to health policy which seek to redress structural inequal-\nities in society as a means to improving population health. This has led to calls\nfor institutional reforms that guarantee better access to health information and\nprograms that promote community support in improving access to health care.\nSocial capital theory has had a considerable influence on the health inequal-\nities debate. Three main theories to explain the socioeconomic gradient respons-\nible for health inequalities have been proposed. The first is the neo-material\ninterpretation where the role of infrastructure and the welfare state is seen as\nthe main causal mechanism (Lynch et al., 2000). The relationship between\nthis and social capital is yet to be fully explored. An important area for future\nresearch raised by Inversen (2008) in this issue is the potential crowding in\n(out) between welfare state and social capital expansion. The welfare state\ncould stand as an explanation for weak social capital effects in countries where\nhealth care provision is already generous. The second is the cultural\/behavioural\nexplanation supported by evidence of extensive differences between social\nclasses in health-related behavioural risk factors such as smoking (Huisman\net al., 2005) and obesity (Costa-Font and Gil, 2006, 2008). Interdependent pre-\nferences may play an important role in developing this research. Third is the\npsychosocial environment interpretation which can be sub-divided into effects\nwhich (a) take place in the body through psycho-neuro-endocrine mechanisms\n(perceptions of low social rank causing chronic stress) and (b) take place in soci-\nety through reduced social capital. The former psychosocial explanation is sup-\nported by the Whitehall study (Marmot and Wilkinson, 1999), which showed\nthat among British civil servants the employment grade in prevalence of the\nmetabolic syndrome (which has been shown to predict diabetes and coronary\nheart disease) alone was more powerful than the combination of behavioural\nrisk factors, including smoking, physical activity, and alcohol consumption.\nThe latter psychosocial explanation is supported by Kawachi et al. (1997)\nwho demonstrated that various measures of \u2018social trust\u2019 were negatively corre-\nlated with income inequality and rates of most major causes of death, after\nadjusting for poverty. Another study found that social capital measured by indi-\nvidual level participation in, for example, political parties and organizations\nwas a strong predictor of socioeconomic differences in leisure-time physical\nactivity, controlling for demographic and other variables (Lindstrom et al.,\n2001). The results of Jusot et al. (2008) in this issue suggest that psychosocial\nfactors may partially explain social inequalities in health in France. However,\n422 J O A N C O S T A - F O N T A N D P H I L I P A M L A D O V S K Y\nas this article as highlighted, it is still unclear through which mechanisms social\ncapital affects health inequalities.\nIn short, research over the last 20 years has led to evidence that all three cau-\nsal mechanisms (neo-material, cultural\/behavioural, and psychosocial) probably\nhave an effect on the socioeconomic gradient in health and importantly that\nthese causal mechanisms interact with each other. This suggests that policies\nare needed which address all three factors. One implication of this is that there\nneed not be a stark division between liberal and structural policies, whereby an\nimportant step forward would be for the design of incentives for health behavi-\nour. It also suggests a need, as argued in this article, for studies of each causal\nmechanism to include variables which incorporate the effect of the other two\nmechanisms. Studies of social capital have not succeeded in this to date,\nalthough in many cases limitations in the data make this understandable.\n4. Conclusion\nWe have argued that one way to interpret the evidence that social capital\nstands behind health production is to take into account the endogenous \u2018social\ncreation of preferences and constraints\u2019 along with other forms of social\ninteraction effects (Manski, 2000). Empirical evidence seems to suggest that\nsocial capital has a \u2018conveyor effect\u2019 in the efficiency of health production,\ninfluencing demand for health and individuals\u2019 perceptions of health risks.\nHowever, further empirical evidence is required to test these effects so that\nsocial capital effects are correctly differentiated from other correlated effects\nand unobservable variables. Upon confirmative findings, we might call for a\nre-conceptualization of evidence explaining health production and demand for\nhealth and health care.\nThe literature on the associated influences and potential channels through\nwhich social capital affects health is increasing, but the understanding of its\nmechanisms is still in its infancy, even though these mechanisms are a funda-\nmental factor in explaining health behaviour, as well as physical and mental\nhealth outcomes and the causes of health inequalities. An area that has not\nreceived sufficient attention in the literature, which to date has largely focused\non pure individualistic models, is the influence of culturally transmitted endo-\ngenous effects such as social identity and interdependent preferences for\nheath-related risk behaviour. We argue that social capital studies have the\npotential to investigate the type and the intensity of social constraints on indivi-\nduals\u2019 health-related behaviour, as well as follow Manski\u2019s (2000) tradition, in\nstudying how people perceive health risks, form expectations of the future, and\ninfluence each other through signalling their preference through their actions.\nAccordingly, rather than being understood in isolation, we argue that rational\nhealth behaviour results from solving coordination problems influenced by a\nSocial capital and health preferences 423\nlarge set of both observable (e.g., education and income) and to date largely\nunobservable (in econometric models) social constraints (e.g., social norms\nand identity). This new tradition of economic analysis calling for the incorpora-\ntion of cultural transmission and social multiplier effects may be able to\nenhance the utility of social capital theory further by incorporating the influence\nof factors traditionally conceptualized as \u2018unobservable\u2019 constraints.\nReferences\nAkerlof, G. and R.E.
