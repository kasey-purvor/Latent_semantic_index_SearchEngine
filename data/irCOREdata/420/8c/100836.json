INTRODUCTION\nThe nuclear giant dipole resonance (GDR) is a most\npronounced feature in the excitation spectrum, giving crucial\nclues to the understanding of nuclear structure and dynamics.\nSince its first observation [1], it has been much studied. For\nreviews see, for example [2,3] from the experimental side\nand [4\u20137] for the theoretical aspects, or [8] for both. Yet, there\nare still many interesting questions that deserve continued\nstudies on that subject. The upcoming possibility to measure\nGDR in exotic nuclei [9] challenges theorists to scrutinize\nthe predictive value of their models. Of particular interest\nhere are self-consistent mean-field approaches that describe\nthe ground-state and the excitation spectrum within one and\nthe same parametrization. For a recent review see, for example\n[10]. The additional information from GDR probes otherwise\nloosely fixed aspects of effective mean-field models. This has\nbeen investigated for the case of the Skyrme-Hartree-Fock\n(SHF) method in, for example [11,12] and there is still some\nway to go for a full incorporation of all that information\ninto effective mean-field theories. One such aspect that has\nnot yet been much investigated is GDR in deformed nuclei,\nthis is due to the great technical complications involved in\nthe corresponding calculations. Nonetheless, deformed nuclei\nprovide an interesting testing ground because there is a\nstrong interplay between the structure of the GDR and the\nground-state deformation [13].\nIt is the aim of this paper to present an exploration\nof the GDR in deformed nuclei, computing the excitation\nspectra using the SHF method. The deformation removes\nthe degeneracy of the resonance peaks in spatial x, y, and\nz directions, leading to a collective splitting of the resonance\n[13]. A competing mechanism that also spreads the resonance\npeak to some extent is Landau fragmentation, which results\nfrom a coupling of the resonance with energetically close\n\u2217Electronic address: mpt218@theorie2.physik.uni-erlangen.de\none-particle-one-hole (1ph) states. (Landau fragmentation is\nthe discrete-spectrum cousin of Landau damping, which is a\nwell-known effect in bulk matter [14].) The interplay of these\ntwo mechanisms was studied recently for the case of deformed\nmetal clusters and it was found that Landau fragmentation can\nmask deformation splitting under certain conditions [15]. We\nwill address this question here for the case of medium-heavy\nand heavy nuclei.\nA standard method to compute GDR spectra is the random-\nphase approximation (RPA) [5,7]. It can be considered as the\nsmall-amplitude limit of time-dependent mean-field equations\n[16,17], but most practical solution schemes map that formally\ninto an algebra of 1ph states. This becomes computationally\nvery expensive for deformed systems owing to an enormous\nproliferation of necessary 1ph states. A formally simpler\nalternative is to use the straightforward time-dependent mean-\nfield theory and extract the resonance pattern by spectral\nanalysis of the time-dependent results. This method has been\nused successfully many times for computing resonance spectra\nin metal clusters [18\u201320]. It has also been applied in nuclear\nphysics with symmetry restrictions [21\u201324], and more recently\nin some unrestricted calculations [25\u201327], which promise a\nrich future for the method. In this paper, we use a fully fledged\ntime-dependent SHF model without any symmetry restrictions\nto compute the isovector-dipole strength in deformed nuclei.\nOnly a brief outline of the model is given in Sec. II. Technical\ndetails of the method will be fully described in a forthcoming\npaper.\nII. FORMAL FRAMEWORK\nA. Mean-\ufb01eld equations\nIn the following, we give only a brief account of the time-\ndependent SHF method and its solution. The underlying SHF\nfunctional and subsequent mean-field equations are explained\nin more detail in, for example [10,28,29].\n0556-2813\/2005\/71(6)\/064328(8)\/$23.00 064328-1 \u00a92005 The American Physical Society\nMARUHN, REINHARD, STEVENSON, STONE, AND STRAYER PHYSICAL REVIEW C 71, 064328 (2005)\nThe starting point is the SHF energy functional E =\nE(\u03c1, \u03c4,J , j, \u03c3 ) expressed in terms of a few local densities and\ncurrents obtained as a sum over single-particle wave functions:\ndensity \u03c1, kinetic density \u03c4 , spin-orbit density J , current j,\nand spin density \u03c3 , where each features twice, once for protons\nand once for neutrons. It is augmented by a pairing functional\ndeduced from a zero-range two-body force (volume pairing).\nThe mean-field equations are derived by variation with respect\nto the densities, yielding for the static case\n\u02c6h\u03d5\u03b1 = \u03b5\u03b1\u03d5\u03b1 (1)\nand for the time-dependent case\n\u0131\u2202t\u03d5\u03b1 = \u02c6h\u03d5\u03b1, (2)\nwhere \u03d5\u03b1 are the active single-nucleon wave functions and \u02c6h\nis the mean-field Hamiltonian, which depends on all densities\nand currents. This is complemented by the gap equations. We\ntreat pairing within the BCS approximation [10] and we do\nthat only for the static solution. The occupation amplitudes\nare then fixed during the time evolution of the system.\nThis is an acceptable approximation for the spectra in the\nresonance region (i.e., for energies around and above 10 MeV).\nDynamical changes in pairing will mostly affect the low-lying\nstates not considered here.\nThe practical solution of the mean-field equations em-\nploys a representation of fields and wave functions on a\nthree-dimensional Cartesian grid in coordinate space whereas\nderivatives are evaluated in Fourier-transformed space [30].\nWe use grids with 24 \u00d7 24 \u00d7 24 points (the z dimension\nis extended to 32 points for 238U) and a grid spacing of\n1 fm. The fast Fourier transformation (FFT) is used for\nswapping between coordinate and momentum space. The\naccelerated gradient iteration is employed to find the stationary\nground-state solution [30,31]. A Taylor series expansion of\nthe mean-field propagator is used for the dynamical time\nstepping [32]. The size of the time step is 0.2 fm\/c.\nB. The choice of the force\nThe SHF functional sets only a framework within which\nthere are myriad different parametrizations. Almost all pa-\nrameter sets describe ground-state properties equally well\nbut differ in other observables (e.g., excitation spectra or\nnuclear matter properties) [33]. One thus should, in principle,\nalways consider several sufficiently different parametrizations\nto disentangle particularities of a given parametrization from\ngeneral features of the SHF model. Large-scale surveys\nin connection with the GDR in spherical nuclei had been\nperformed in [11,12]. The computationally demanding, fully\ntriaxial calculations force us to constrain the variety. We\nuse here the two parametrizations SkI3 [34] and SLy6 [35].\nBoth are recent developments that try to take care of special\nfeatures in addition to the usual ground-state properties. SkI3\nemploys an extended spin-orbit functional whose isovector\nproperties resemble relativistic models. SLy6 has a bias on\nneutron-rich systems up to neutron stars. Both provide a\nreasonable description of the GDR in 208Pb [10,12]. As a\nbrief reminder of typical results for GDR with SHF, we show\nTABLE I. The average GDR resonance frequencies for two dou-\nbly magic nuclei computed with the two forces under consideration\nand compared with experimental (Exp.) data [3].

SLy6 SkI3\n(MeV) (MeV) (MeV)\n16O 23.5 19.6 20.2\n208Pb 13.5 13.9 13.4\nresults in Table I for one very light and one heavy doubly\nmagic nucleus for the two forces. The results are typical for\nall other presently available Skyrme forces [12]. One can\nachieve a good description of the GDR position in 208Pb and at\nthe same time one grossly underestimates the resonant range\nfor 16O where the average resonance strength lies 2\u20134 MeV\nbelow the experimental data. We thus constrain consideration\nto heavier systems where we hope that we can trust the given\nparametrizations with respect to GDR.\nC. Spectral analysis\nThe dipole strength of the nuclei is computed using the\nstandard procedure of spectral analysis [19]. We start from\nthe ground state and apply an instantaneous momentum boost\nto the center of mass of the protons with a reverse boost to\nthe neutrons. This means that each nucleon wave function is\naugmented by a phase factor\n\u03d5\u03b1(r) \u2212\u2192 \u03d5\u03b1(r, t =0) = e\u0131b\u03bdr\u03d5\u03b1(r), (3)\nwhere b\u03bd is the boost momentum of nucleon type \u03bd. Proton\nand neutron boost sum to conserve center-of-mass momen-\ntum (i.e., Zbp + Nbn = 0). The amplitude of the boost is\nkept sufficiently small to stay well in the linear regime\nof excitations. The direction of the boost selects the mode\nthat is excited. We chose a diagonal excitation with b\u03bd \u221d\nex + ey + ez to access all three basic modes at once. The\nthree components of the total isovector-dipole momentum are\nrecorded during the subsequent dynamics, yielding the dipole\nsignal D(t) in the time domain. Spectral analysis requires\nsome filtering to avoid artefacts from the limited time span\nof computation [36]. (We compute up to a time of 1600 fm\/c\nwhich leaves sufficient resolution for the GDR region.) We\ndo filtering in the time domain using a Gaussian smoothing\nD(t) \u2212\u2192 D(t) exp [\u2212(t\/\u03c4 )2] with \u03c4 = 350 fm\/c. Finally, the\ndipole strength (=ptical absorption strength) is obtained as\nthe imaginary part of the Fourier transform [i.e., Si(\u03c9) =\n\u0004{ \u02dcDi(\u03c9)}]. Having the three spatial components recorded\nseparately, we obtain separate information about the dipole\nstrength for all three modes. The simplification of using a\ndiagonal excitation is applicable if the optical axes of the\nnucleus are identical with the axes of the coordinate system.\nAll considered nuclei fulfill this condition because their ground\nstate is reflection symmetric with respect to all three axes. To\nmake the smoothing effective we run the dynamics up to at least\n4\u03c4 = 1400 fm\/c. The spectral resolution is then approximately\n064328-2\nDIPOLE GIANT RESONANCES IN DEFORMED HEAVY NUCLEI PHYSICAL REVIEW C 71, 064328 (2005)\n\n\u03c9 \u2248 4\u03c4\u22121 \u2248 2 MeV. This suffices for studies in the GDR\nregion. The GDR peak is in the particle continuum. We use\na finite box that artificially discretizes the continuum. The\nresolution of 2 MeV is larger than the expected escape width\nsuch that this sort of continuum effect is masked anyway.\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nA. Simple estimates\nThere is a very simple, and yet reliable, estimate for the\naverage frequency of the GDR peak [37]:\n\u03c90 = 80 MeV A\u22121\/3. (4)\nNote the trend \u221d A\u22121\/3 \u221d R\u22121, where R is the nuclear radius.\nThis is motivated by the viewpoint that the GDR is zero-sound\nand that the largest wavelength in a finite system is proportional\nto R. The estimate (4) is a useful guideline for spherical nuclei.\nDeformed nuclei show a splitting that can be estimated by\nconsidering the trend with inverse length for each direction\nseparately, thus \u03c9i \u221d R\u22121i for i \u2208 {x, y, z}. The deformation\ncan be described by stretching factors Ri \u2212\u2192 \u03b7iR, where\n\u03b7x\u03b7y\u03b7z = 1. This yields immediately \u03c9i = \u03c90\/\u03b7i . For axially\nsymmetric systems, one has \u03b7x = \u03b7y , which leaves one number\nto characterize the deformation. Let us assume for instance that\nthis is done in terms of the axis ratio\n\u03b6 = Rz\/Rx = \u03b7z\/\u03b7x. (5)\nTogether with the condition \u03b72x\u03b7z = 1, we can then easily\nderive the simple estimate\n\u03c9x,y = \u03c90\u03b6 1\/2, \u03c9z = \u03c90\u03b6\u22121. (6)\nMore often, deformation is characterized in terms of\nthe quadrupole momentum Q20 = \u3008r2Y20\u3009. This, however,\nchanges scale with R2 and thus hinders an immediate geomet-\nrical appreciation. Therefore, one prefers the dimensionless\nquadrupole momentum\n\u03b22\u00b5 = 4\u03c05\n\u3008r2Y2\u00b5\u3009\nAr20\n, r0 = 0.93 A1\/3, (7)\nwhere only \u00b5 = 0 and \u00b5 = 2 are needed in a properly aligned\n(i.e., intrinsic) system. Note that the denominator is often taken\nas \u3008r2\u3009 instead of the Ar20 . The two conventions are practi-\ncally identical for small deformations. The present choice is\nadvantageous for large deformations where it stretches the\nscale. For axially symmetric systems, one encounters \u03b222 = 0.\nThe relation of \u03b220 to the axis ratio (5) is then for small\ndeformations\n\u03b6 \u2248 1 + 3\n2\n\u221a\n4\u03c0\n5\n\u03b220, (8)\nwith obvious consequences for the estimated GDR frequencies\n(6). Figure 1 sketches a schematic GDR splitting along the\nthree principle axes of an axially symmetric nucleus. The\npeak position of each of the collective dipole modes is\nindicated by an arrow. The relative strengths indicate the sign\nof deformation. Prolate nuclei have two states at the higher\nfrequency.\ndi\npo\nle\n s\ntre\nng\nth\n\u03c9\n\u03c9 z\n\u03c9x,y\ndef. splitting\nprolate\nnucleus\nFIG. 1. Schematic view of collective dipole strengths in a prolate\ndeformed nucleus. The dashed lines show the strength for the x-y and\nz modes separately.\nThe lines are broadened by several effects (for an extensive\nreview see [38]): coupling of the collective strength to the\n1ph states (spreading width, often called Landau fragmen-\ntation), particle escape into the continuum (escape width;\nsee, e.g. [39]), correlations from nucleon-nucleon collisions\n(collisional broadening, see, e.g. [40]), and coupling to\nlow-lying vibrations (phonon coupling; see, e.g. [41]). The\nlast two broadening mechanisms are related to 2 ph or higher\nconfigurations and go beyond a mean-field treatment. The\ncollisional correlations deliver a smooth broadening of about\n0.5\u20131 MeV. The surface coupling depends sensitively on\nthe softness of the nucleus, being small for near-magic or\nwell-deformed nuclei and larger in the transitional region.\nNeither of these effects are accounted for in the present calcu-\nlations. We assume that they are hidden under the rather large\nsmoothing width of about 2 MeV. The Landau fragmentation\nand escape width belong to 1ph mechanisms and are accessible\nto mean-field models. The escape width is related to the particle\ncontinuum, giving each single-particle state in the energy\nrange of 5\u201310 MeV a width of 0.5\u20131 Mev. Such a splitting\nis not resolved with the present precision. Thus three of the\nbroadening mechanisms\u2014collisional, phonon coupling, and\nescape\u2014are masked by the global width introduced through\nsmoothing the signal. This is indicated by the broadening in\nFig. 1. The collective splitting can be nicely seen provided that\nits energetic separation exceeds the line broadening and that\nthe broadening is smooth.\nThere remains the Landau fragmentation, which is the\nmajor source of width in nuclei. The density of 1ph states in\nmedium-size nuclei is not so large, and thus Landau fragmen-\ntation can induce a discrete pattern rather than a global broad-\nening. The effects depend on the detailed shell structure of a\ngiven nucleus and even change for different forces. Figure 2\nshows the dipole spectrum in doubly magic 132Sn in high\nresolution to display more clearly the distribution of dipole\nstrength over the range of the GDR. The spectrum in the GDR\nregion shows very detailed structures that are related to the\nunderlying spectrum of 1ph states. (A detailed discussion for\nthe comparable case of metal clusters is found in [42].) An\nalmost direct relation between the small peaks in the wings of\nthe dipole distribution and the 1ph states can be established\nwhen taking into account that the residual interaction causes a\n064328-3\nMARUHN, REINHARD, STEVENSON, STONE, AND STRAYER PHYSICAL REVIEW C 71, 064328 (2005)\n 8  10  12\n 14  16  18  20  22\ndi\npo\nle\n s\ntre\nng\nth\n [a\nrb.\nun\nits\n]\nfrequency \u03c9 [MeV]\n132Sn\nSLy6\nFIG. 2.

Experimentally, the high resolution in Fig. 2\nis unrealistic because the other aforementioned broadening\nmechanisms smooth the spectrum. In practice, one sees a broad\nGDR peak with some structures where the fragmentation is\nlarger than the smoothing. For example, the well-separated\nlarge peak at about 17 MeV will show up as a high-energy\nshoulder in the spectrum. As a general rule, the collective\nresonance [see Eq. (4)] as well as the typical 1ph transitions\nfollow the same trend \u221d A\u22121\/3. Thus Landau fragmentation is\nequally important in all nuclei. However, the spectral density\nincreases with A such that the broadening becomes smoother\nfor heavy nuclei whereas very fuzzy distributions are seen for\nlight nuclei (and also for exotic ones). The nuclei that are\nstudied here are mostly of medium size. It is interesting to\nsee how the fragmentation performs there. As a side remark,\nwe note that metal clusters are finite fermion systems, which\nhave many similarities with nuclei [43]. They also have a\ngiant dipole resonance, called the Mie surface plasmon. And\nagain, this mode shows significant Landau fragmentation in\nthe range of medium sizes [15] whereas the pattern becomes\nmuch smoother for huge sizes (N \u2248 1000, a size not accessible\nto nuclei) [44].\nSince both ways of expressing deformations are in use, we\nprovide in Table II the information on deformation for all axi-\nally symmetric test cases together with the deduced estimates\nfor the peak frequencies. According to our SHF calculations,\nwe have one fully triaxial nucleus in the sample, 188Os. Its\naxes are related as z : y : x = 1.62 : 1.22 : 1, yielding the\nestimated frequencies \u03c9x = 17.46 MeV, \u03c9y = 14.25 MeV,\nand \u03c9z = 10.74 MeV. The superdeformed state in 152Dy is\na matter of debate. It has been found also in other mean-field\ncalculations [45\u201347], but its appearance depends on the force\nand pairing recipe. We take it here as a principle example for\na superdeformed state.\nB.

The\neffect should, in principle, deliver a smooth peak broadening\nand it would do so in much heavier systems. Nuclei around\nA \u2248 150 still have obviously a too dilute 1ph spectrum,\nwhich, in turn, can yield a structured peak broadening. The\nestimate (4) with (6), although a bit too high, shows satisfying\nagreement in view of its enormous simplicity.\nThe deformation grows gradually when moving from 142Nd\nto 150Nd. The separate strengths show the corresponding\ncollective shifts more or less in agreement with the simple\nestimates. It is obvious, however, that in the transitional region\nthe width of the peaks is larger than the shift. This inhibits a\nclear identification of weak deformations, particularly because\nLandau fragmentation reduces the apparent peaks and can\ngive misleading visual impressions. It is only for the heaviest\nand most strongly deformed nucleus in the sample that\ndeformation splitting safely outweighs Landau fragmentation.\nThe collective estimate (6) shows a splitting of the same order,\nhowever always with a tendency to overestimate. There is a\nfurther feature by which the detailed results differ from the\nschematic view of Fig. 1. One rarely spots the weight of the\nmode from the mere height of the peaks. Broadening can\nbe much different in the two modes and one has to analyze\nthe total strength under a peak. This goes beyond a simple\ngraphical inspection and requires peak fitting. Altogether,\nthe analysis of deformation is somewhat uncertain because\nof the interplay with Landau fragmentation. This sets an\nuncertainty of \u03b4\u03b2 \u2248 0.05 in the analysis provided it is done\non the grounds of comparison with microscopic calculations.\nDeducing deformation from scanning two peaks and relating it\nto the simple estimate (6) adds another bit of systematic error.\nThese findings are very similar to the results for medium-size\nmetal clusters [15].\nFigure 4 compares the results from two different Skyrme\nforces with experimental data. In all cases the average strength\nfits nicely to the experimental data with a tendency to a slight\ndownshift of order 1 MeV. The agreement is better for 208Pb\nand much worse for light nuclei (see Table I). It is not yet\nclear whether the underestimation of about 1 MeV seen here\nis already the beginning of the trend.\nThe theoretical spectra in the spherical 142Nd show strong\nLandau fragmentation for both forces. The details, however,\ndiffer owing to a somewhat different shell structure. The\nhigh-lying shoulder is farther away from the resonance for SkI3\nand is consequently weaker. Unfortunately, it seems that the\nexperimental resolution does not allow sufficient detail in the\nfragmentation to be discriminated, or it may be that there is less\nfragmentation than both Skyrme forces show. The deformation\nis growing slowly with increasing N. The next nucleus in\nthe chain, 144Nd, is still dominated by Landau fragmentation.\nBut a weak deformation splitting may be seen already for\n146Nd for SkI3 where the 1ph splitting is higher up in the\nspectrum whereas the more compact pattern of SLy6 still hides\nthe collective effect. The experimental data are, however, too\ncoarse to resolve any detail here. A similar situation is found\nfor 148Nd. In fact, the qualitative differences between SkI3\nand SLy6 look even more dramatic here.

Finally, the largest nucleus\nin the sample, 150Nd, is sufficiently well deformed to show\nqualitatively clear signs of deformation splittings in equal\nmanner for both forces and in the data. Even the magnitude\nof splitting seems to match. The slightly smaller splitting\nproduced by SkI3 may be closer to the experimental situation,\nbut this observation has to be taken with care because the\nresults are masked to some extent by Landau fragmentation.\nC. A superdeformed isomer\nWe have learned in the previous subsection that one needs\na sufficiently large deformation to make the deformation\nsplitting visible above the \u201cbackground\u201d of Landau fragmen-\ntation and other broadening effects. It is natural then to go\none step further and to look for a superdeformed nucleus.\nFigure 5 shows the case of 152Dy as one example.

The estimated peak positions (see Sec. III A) are indicated\nby arrows.\nThe entanglement is worse than for 150Nd, where the splitting\nwas better separated despite the fact that both systems\nhave about the same deformation. This shows clearly that a\ncareful microscopic analysis is required before concluding\nthat there is a deformation splitting from an experimental\nGDR spectrum. The superdeformed state, however, indicates\nvery clear splitting, larger than the line widths, which allows\nan immediate identification of deformation. Similar structures\nwere found previously in a calculations based on a deformed\nshell model [48]. A word of caution is in place here. The\nresonance spectrum has been computed in the limit of small-\namplitude oscillations about the local minimum. A very small\namplitude, corresponding to an average excitation energy of\nabout 0.1 MeV, has been used to stay safely in the vicinity\nof the minimum. The actual excitation energy, however, is at\nleast 8 MeV and thus far above the barrier to the ground state.\nThe photo-excited nucleus will thus move quickly toward the\nground-state shape, which, in turn, broadens the resonance\nsubstantially. A full description of this process requires a very\nelaborate mixing of collective quadrupole motion with the\ngiant resonance [49], which goes beyond the scope of this\npaper.

This is not surprising for this large\ndeformation because the simple geometrical idea behind the\nestimate (simple ellipsoidal shapes) may be too crude. Keeping\nthat in mind, a 30% precision of an empirical formula is a nice\nachievement.\nD. Triaxiality\nTriaxial nuclei display three different principal axes and\nthus also deliver three different GDR peaks, as discussed\nin Sec. III A. Deformation splitting is distributed over an\nadditional peak and thus is probably harder to identify. One\nneeds a nucleus with a sufficiently large net deformation. Our\ncalculations provided such a situation for 188Os. Figure 6\nshows its dipole strength distribution. Somewhat to our\nsurprise, the perturbing effects from Landau fragmentation\nare small here and we resolve nicely a triple splitting in\nthe theoretical calculation. However, the experimental data\nlook much different in every respect. They do not show any\nindication of a triple splitting. The nucleus 188Os has an energy\nlandscape with various isomers. Moreover, this landscape\nvaries with various Skyrme forces to the extent that ground\nstate and isomers are placed differently. It is very likely that\nthe theoretical calculation for that particular force SLy6 has\ninterchanged ground state with isomer. The figure then shows,\nat least from the theoretical side, the type of spectra at which\none has to look to single out candidates for triaxiality.\nE. A heavy deformed nucleus\nFinally, it is worth checking a much heavier nucleus.\nFigure 7 shows the spectra for the ground state of 238U. In both\nmodes, there is some shoulder from Landau fragmentation.\nHowever, the dominant peaks are sufficiently well developed\nto allow a discrimination of the deformation splitting. Both\nmodes show a shoulder at about 15 MeV.

They differ in detail to the extent\nthat the data do not show such a clear shoulder.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nWe have computed dipole strength distributions for de-\nformed nuclei within the framework of time-dependent\nSkyrme-Hartree-Fock method. The spectra are obtained from\nfully fledged dynamical calculations starting from an in-\nstantaneous isovector-dipole boost and subsequent spectral\nanalysis of the emerging dipole signal. No symmetry restric-\ntions are imposed. Thus all possible nuclear shapes can be\ntackled.\nThe scheme has been used to study, at a microscopic\nlevel, the deformation effects on the spectra in the region\nof the giant dipole resonance. Collective estimates predict\na splitting of the GDR, where the mode vibrating along the\ncompressed direction is shifted upword in frequency, whereas\nthe elongated mode is shifted downword. The microscopic\ncalculations confirm that effect, in principle. In practice,\nthere is a competing mechanism that produces also detailed\nsubstructures in the spectra. This is Landau fragmentation\ncaused by coupling of the collective strength to 1ph states\nthat are close in energy. This effect is found to be still\nquite large for medium-heavy nuclei such that it masks the\ndeformation splitting to a certain extent. Small deformations\nin the transitional region cannot be identified unambiguously\nfrom the GDR spectra alone. Well-deformed nuclei have a\nbetter chance to display the deformation splitting above the\n\u201cbackground\u201d of Landau fragmentation. We have even found\nvisible signals of triaxial deformations. A particularly dramatic\nsplitting, beyond any doubt, is found in superdeformed\nisomers.\nThe present exploration has employed only two different\nSkyrme forces to get some indication of the force sensitivity\nof the effects. The deformation splitting is found to be robust,\nbut the detailed pattern from Landau fragmentation is more\nforce dependent. More systematic surveys are needed to track\nthe variance of theoretical results and to thus deliver reliable\nguidelines for the analysis of the data. Work in that direction\nis in progress.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Vladimir Pronyaev for help in collecting the\nexperimental data.
