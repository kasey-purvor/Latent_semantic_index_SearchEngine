Introduction\n[2] Forward fault displacement models based on elastic\ndislocation (ED) theory have been used to predict displace-\nments and strains due to coseismic slip events [King and\nVita-Finzi, 1981; Stein and Barrientos, 1985; Stein et al.,\n1988]. More recently, ED forward modeling of faults\nresolved on reflection seismic profiles has been used to\npredict small-scale, subseismic fracture patterns in faulted\nhydrocarbon reservoirs [e.g., Maerten et al., 2002; Bourne\nand Willemse, 2001; Bourne et al., 2001]. In this paper, the\nstrain fields from forward ED models are used to calculate a\ncorresponding redistributed stress field associated with\ncoseismic fault slip, which is then combined with regional\nstress and\/or overburden stress components to define the\ntotal stress field within the faulted rock. This total stress\nfield may be used to predict the mode, orientation and\ndistribution of smaller, or \u2018\u2018secondary,\u2019\u2019 fractures, caused by\nthe stress redistribution during faulting.\n[3] The exposed surface deformation due to large on-\nshore earthquakes can be used to test the predictions and\nconstrain the parameters in elastic models. The Ms 7.3 El\nAsnam earthquake of October 1980 was one of the largest\nobserved in the western Mediterranean region (Figure 1a).\nSeveral groups studied the immediate aftermath of this\nearthquake providing details on surface breaks [Philip and\nMeghraoui, 1983] and seismicity, including focal plane\nsolutions of aftershocks in the surrounding area [Yielding\net al., 1981; King and Yielding, 1984]. From these data\nvarious authors have modeled the fault related displace-\nments using elastic dislocation theory [e.g., King and Vita-\nFinzi, 1981; Cisternas et al., 1982; Ruegg et al., 1982;\nBezzeghoud et al., 1995]. Some of this earlier work relies\non matching calculated vertical displacements against\ngeodetic measurements made along a single benchmark\nroute, but the general form of the deep slip is constrained\nTECTONICS, VOL. 23, TC6005, doi:10.1029\/2003TC001575, 2004\nCopyright 2004 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0278-7407\/04\/2003TC001575$12.00\nTC6005 1 of 21\nby analysis of a triangulated network by Ruegg et al.\n[1982].\n[4] We present a new fault model for the 1980 earthquake\nat El Asnam that fits both the benchmarked geodetic data and\nthe distribution of surface fractures. We compare modeled\nsurface fracture patterns with those observed to further\nconstrain the fault model. The geodetic data are limited to\nmeasurements of the vertical component of surface deforma-\ntion; by using the surface fractures caused by the coseismic\nstress perturbation to constrain our models we can indirectly\nsample all three components of the near-surface displace-\nment field. In addition, the surface fractures are spatially\nmore widely distributed than the geodetic measurements.\n2. El Asnam Earthquake of October 1980\n2.1. General Setting\n[5] Full details of the regional setting, earthquake seis-\nmology, aftershock distribution and surface deformation for\nthe October 1980 El Asnam earthquake are given by\nYielding et al. [1981], Ruegg et al. [1982], Philip and\nMeghraoui [1983], King and Yielding [1984], Yielding et\nal. [1989] and Bezzeghoud et al. [1995]. Here we simply\ndescribe the key features and some detailed structural\nobservations used in testing the ED models.\n[6] The city of El Asnam was located in the Algerian\nAtlas mountains (see Figure 1a) at the eastern end of the\nLower Chelif Basin (the city was renamed Ech Chelif after\nthe 1980 earthquake). Miocene-Pliocene marls, sandstones\nand calcarenites have been deformed by repeated tectonic\nactivity. The area is dominated by NE trending reverse\nfaults and associated hanging wall anticlines (Figure 1b).\nThe 1980 earthquake occurred on a previously unrecog-\nnised, segmented reverse fault with a surface rupture run-\nning for a total of 30 km (Figure 1c). The average fault trace\ntrends around 050\u0001 and the average fault slip direction was\naround 140\u0001. Field measurements on exposed fault planes\nreveal no significant strike-slip component at the surface.\nFocal plane solutions for the main shocks are consistent\nwith the observed reverse fault geometry, and the aftershock\ndistribution is consistent with a planar fault system extend-\ning to at least 10 km depth.\n2.2. Key Structural Features\n[7] An important observation from the detailed structural\nmapping is the wide range of smaller faults developed\naround the larger reverse faults. Fractures with normal,\nstrike-slip and reverse displacements, and oblique-slip com-\nbinations and tensile fissures are present in complex net-\nworks (for details see Yielding et al. [1981] and Philip and\nFigure 1. Location maps. (a) Map showing the broad area of active seismicity between North Africa\nand Europe with relative plate motion indicated by arrows [after Anderson and Jackson, 1987]. Overall\nconvergence direction for Algeria is toward the NNW. Rectangle outlines the Chelif Basins. (b) Regional\ntectonic framework of the Lower and Middle Chelif Basins. Note the broadly NE\/SW trending thrust\nfaults and parallel fold axes. EA marks the location of the city of El Asnam. (c) Structural map [after King\nand Yielding, 1984] of the fault zone east of El Asnam. The main shock mechanism and location of the\nMs = 7.3 earthquake on 10 October 1980 are indicated. A segmented reverse fault system over 30 km\nlong trends NE\/SW. In detail, a complex pattern of normal and strike-slip faults occurs in the hanging\nwalls of the reverse faults. Tensile fractures are also abundant.\nTC6005 HEALY ET AL.: FRACTURE PREDICTION FOR EL ASNAM VIA ED MODELING\n2 of 21\nTC6005\nMeghraoui [1983]). In the north central segment around\nSera el Maarouf (labelled B on Figure 1c), a prominent\nasymmetric anticline forms a topographic ridge in the\nhanging wall of a reverse fault. An en echelon zone of\nnormal faults with linking arrays of tensile fissures is\ndeveloped along the crest of this ridge. The normal fault\nplanes trend NNE\/SSW, oblique to the underlying reverse\nfault. Measurements of fault offset, taken shortly after the\n1980 earthquake [King and Vita-Finzi, 1981; Yielding et al.,\n1981], indicate slip vectors normal to the underlying reverse\nfault trace. Fault plane slickenlines recorded from shear\nfractures exposed in this area [Philip and Meghraoui, 1983]\nmust have existed prior to the 1980 event, because mechan-\nical considerations dictate that surface fractures are tensile.\nAlong the south central segment (labelled A2 on Figure 1c)\nnormal faults and tensile cracks are present in another\nhanging wall anticline, but these extensional fractures run\nparallel to the underlying reverse fault. At the SW tip of\nexposed surface breaks there is some evidence from fault\nstriae for a small (1\u20132 m) sinistral component of fault slip.\nThese observations are supported by focal plane solutions\nfor numerous aftershocks measured in the area (see Figure 8\nof King and Yielding [1984]).\n3. Formulation of the Elastic Dislocation\nFracture Prediction Model\n3.1. Elastic Dislocation Theory\n[8] In ED theory [Steketee, 1958; Rongved and Frasier,\n1958] faults are considered as displacement discontinuities\nor dislocations in an otherwise continuous elastic medium.\nFaults are represented as surfaces across which there is\ndefined to be a discontinuity in the elastic displacement\nfield. The surrounding volume is modeled as a uniform\nelastic half-space with boundary conditions of zero normal\nand shear tractions at the free surface and zero displace-\nment at an infinite distance from any dislocation (i.e., a\nfault). ED theory is conceptually valid for modeling\ncoseismic deformation. If fault slip values are small\nrelative to fault length\/width (<1\u20132%), the resulting dis-\nplacements and strains are effectively infinitesimal. The\nED formulation of Okada [1985, 1992] is used in our\nmodels, which expresses the displacement field ux,y,z at\nany given point as a function of fault parameters (slip, dip,\nstrike, length, and width) and the elastic constants within\nthe continuum, for rectangular fault panels with horizontal\nupper and lower edges (Figure 2). The Okada formulation\nis mathematically robust and tractable, and these attributes\nmake it suitable for rapid, iterative, forward numerical\nmodeling. For modeling the El Asnam earthquake, an\narray of rectangular panels is a sufficient approximation\nto the true fault geometry given the sparse constraints at\ndepth. The restrictions within the Okada ED formulation to\nan elastic half-space and to rectangular fault panels with\nhorizontal upper and lower edges have no significant effect\non our model results. Singularities of calculated displace-\nment and strain can result from observation points located\nat the edges of fault panels but such problematic points are\nsystematically distributed and can be removed.\n3.2. Model Configuration and Parameters\n[9] The elastic constants and other mechanical parame-\nters used throughout this study are shown in Table 1. We are\ninvestigating the coseismic response of the rocks and\ntherefore we model the continuum as a purely elastic solid\nwith no viscous effects (Poisson\u2019s ratio n = 0.25). Figure 2\nillustrates the configuration of a simple ED fault model with\na fault plane represented as a rectangular panel with separate\nprescribed slip values for strike slip and dip slip. Displace-\nments and strains are calculated at discrete observation\npoints, defined as a regular grid on a specified surface.\nThe coordinate reference frame used in this work is also\nshown.\nTable 1.

Calculations are performed\non a regular grid of observation points for a specified\nsurface through the half-space. Faults are modeled as\nrectangular panels with horizontal upper and lower edges.\nSlip values are prescribed for each fault panel.\nTC6005 HEALY ET AL.: FRACTURE PREDICTION FOR EL ASNAM VIA ED MODELING\n3 of 21\nTC6005\n3.3. Calculation of Displacement, Strain, and Stress\n[10] Vertical displacements (uz component of the elastic\ndisplacement field), in metres, have been calculated for grid\nnodes at the surface (z = 0 m). All models use the same grid\nnode array with a uniform 0.5 km horizontal spacing\nbetween nodes. The full elastic strain tensor is also calculated\nusing the same grid node array and is used to calculate an\nelastic stress tensor for each grid node using Hooke\u2019s Law:\nsij \u00bc 2Geij \u00fe lekkdij; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere sij is the elastic stress tensor, G is the shear (or\nrigidity) modulus, eij is the elastic strain tensor, l is the\nLame\u00b4 constant, and dij is the Kronecker delta. The strain and\nstress fields derived from ED theory represent the elastically\nredistributed deformation due to slip on the faults.\n[11] In order to predict rock fracture arising from a\ncoseismic stress redistribution, we need to consider the total\nstress field including overburden stresses (for grid nodes\nbelow the surface, z > 0) and the tectonic or regional stress.\nFor the overburden stress components we assume\nsxx \u00bc syy \u00bc szz \u00bc rgz; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere r is the density of the overburden (assumed con-\nstant), g is acceleration due to gravity and z is the depth.\nThis condition corresponds to a hydrostatic state of stress\nfor the lithostatic overburden component, implying that the\noverburden has no long term shear strength. We believe\nthis to be a valid approximation for fractured and weath-\nered near-surface rocks, such as those present around the\nEl Asnam fault system, where stress corrosion acts on the\njoints and fissures [King and Vita-Finzi, 1981; Vita-Finzi\nand King, 1985]. Note that this does not contradict the use\nof an elastic model to calculate stress changes induced by\nabrupt fault slip over a period of some 30 seconds. Using\nequation 2 and the values for g and r listed in Table 1, the\nvertical component of overburden stress at 50 m depth will\nbe approximately 1 MPa, rising to 2 MPa at 100 m depth.\nGiven the relatively low strength of the exposed rocks\n(cohesion estimated at 1 MPa, see Table 1), this overbur-\nden component of stress is likely to be significant. The\napparently low value of cohesion used in our model is\nbased on field observations and the assumption that\nrepeated earthquakes in the region combined with near-\nsurface weathering will have weakened the initially intact\nrock mass to a much lower strength. The local topography\nis cut by gorges between 50\u2013100 m deep. Note that the\nlow cohesive strength we have chosen for these surface\nrocks (1 MPa, Table 1) is still sufficient to maintain the\nmaximum shear stress induced by the overburden alone\n(\u00061 MPa), and therefore maintain this amount of topo-\ngraphic relief.\n[12] To calculate the regional or tectonic stresses we use\nestimates of regional strain. Ruegg et al. [1982] used a\ntriangulation network around the fault system to estimate\nthe strain tensor associated with the 1980 earthquake; their\nresults can be summarised as a uniaxial shortening of 2.0 \u0007\n10\u00014 along a direction of 140\u0001. From this simplistic strain\nfield with principal strains e1 = 2 \u0007 10\u00014 and e2 = e3 = 0, we\napply Hooke\u2019s Law to derive corresponding regional prin-\ncipal stresses of s1 = 1.2 MPa (most compressive), s2 =\n0.4 MPa and s3 = 0 MPa (least compressive). Assuming\nlinear isotropic elasticity, s1 is horizontal and aligned parallel\nto e1 along 140\u0001, s2 also horizontal, aligned 050\u0001 and s3 is\nvertical. This regional stress field gives a maximum regional\nshear stress of 0.6 MPa, which is significant in its magnitude.\nThe presence of faulted rock does not necessarily imply that\nthe total stress must have exceeded the failure strength at the\ntime of slip [Bourne and Willemse, 2001], only that it must\nhave exceeded the failure strength at some time in the past.\nImposed total stresses below the failure strength could\nreactivate favorably oriented preexisting faults and the large\nreverse faults around El Asnam were certainly in existence\nbefore the 1980 event [King and Vita-Finzi, 1981]. In\nmodeling the surface and near-surface deformation around\nEl Asnamwe have chosen to ignore pore-fluid pressure in the\nstress calculations. This maximises the effective stresses, and\ntherefore minimises potential for failure; including pore-\npressure would generate more fracturing, but not change its\norientation (see also later discussion).\n4. Results From Forward Elastic Dislocation\nModeling of the 1980 El Asnam Earthquake\n[13] Forward modeling attempts to find a best fit to\nobserved data by a process of trial and error, and model\nsolutions are necessarily nonunique. To assess comparable\nforward ED models of the coseismic deformation at El\nAsnam, we employ a combination of quantitative data and\nmore qualitative evidence. Three forward ED models are\npresented in this paper and their results are compared.\nTable 2 lists the fault parameters of each model. The fault\npanel outlines and the fault surface traces for all three\nmodels are shown in Figure 3.\n[14] Model 1 is taken from Ruegg et al. [1982] (their\nModel 03) and comprises a set of four fault panels (see\nFigure 3a) with varying orientations and a mixture of\nreverse dip-slip and sinistral strike-slip. Note that although\nRuegg et al. [1982] presented the results from a \u2018\u2018better\u2019\u2019\nfive-panel model, no parameters were listed for the fifth\npanel: as such we were unable to model this configuration.\nModel 2 is taken directly from Bezzeghoud et al. [1995]\n(their model G) and involves ten panels segmented in\na downdip direction into a ramp-flat-ramp geometry\n(Figure 3c), all with reverse dip slip only. There is no panel\nin this model to represent the fault breaks and deformation\nin the NE corner of the area. Model 3 represents our\npreferred model and is derived largely from that of Ruegg\net al. [1982] (i.e., Model 1). However, we segment the\ncentral panels downdip (Figure 3e) with the middle panel in\neach central segment carrying a larger reverse dip-slip\nvalue. Note that none of the panels in our initial model\nhave a strike-slip component. The total geometric moment\nof Model 3 amounts to 2.0 \u0007 109 m3, and using a value\nfor shear rigidity appropriate to basement rocks Gb (see\nTable 1), this corresponds to a seismic moment of approx-\nTC6005 HEALY ET AL.: FRACTURE PREDICTION FOR EL ASNAM VIA ED MODELING\n4 of 21\nTC6005\nimately 4.0 \u0007 1026 dyne cm. These values are in close\nagreement with the geodetic estimate of Ruegg et al. [1982]\nand the seismic estimates by Yielding [1985], Deschamps et\nal. [1982] and Brustle and Muller [1983].\n4.1. Vertical Surface Displacements Due to Coseismic\nSlip\n[15] Geodetic data have been collected by Ruegg et al.\n[1982] and Bezzeghoud et al. [1995]. In this paper, we use\nthe geodetic measurements made during the 1986 campaign\nof Bezzeghoud et al. [1995] which provides vertical dis-\nplacements along a single route of 25 benchmarks. Much of\nthis route (see symbols on fault panel maps in Figure 3) runs\nsubparallel to the main fault strike with only a short segment\n(benchmarks 10\u201316) normal to fault strike. In our forward\nmodeling, greater weight has been given to the fit of\nmodeled displacement values to those benchmarks closer\nto the fault and trending normal to fault strike, compared to\nthose further away. The benchmarked route represents an\noblique one-dimensional transect through the central seg-\nment. More qualitative information for the whole area is\navailable from detailed local knowledge of the neotectonic\nfeatures and surrounding topography on the assumption that\nrepeated occurrences of earthquakes similar to that of 1980\nhave created the observed structures.\n[16] Figures 3b, 3d, and 3f show contour maps of\npredicted vertical displacements (uz) for each of the three\nfault models, and Figure 4 shows corresponding graphs of\ncalculated versus observed vertical displacement along the\nbenchmark route. Figure 3b shows that Model 1 produces\nsignificant uplift in the immediate hanging walls of the\ncentral and northeasterly segments matching the observa-\ntions of topographic ridges and anticlines in these areas. The\nfit to the geodetic data (Figure 4a) is imperfect especially\naround the key central benchmarks (10\u201316). The overall\nform of the predicted vertical displacements appears valid\nbut the hanging wall has insufficient uplift and the footwall\nhas too much subsidence. Ruegg et al. [1982] noted that\ntheir model required an extra short fault segment between\ntheir panels 2 and 3.\n[17] While not including the northeast segment of the\nfault zone, Model 2 also manages to produce a prominent\nuplift in the hanging wall of the north central segment\n(Figure 3d). However, this displacement high does not\ncoincide with the Sera el Maarouf anticlinal ridge, which\nis situated closer to the main reverse fault trace. The\noverall fit to the geodetic data shows an apparent im-\nprovement over that in Model 1 (compare Figure 4a with\nFigure 4b). The calculated vertical displacements around\nthe central benchmarks are higher than in Model 1.\nHowever, close inspection of the map in Figure 3d and\nthe panel configuration shown in Table 2 for Model 2\ndata shows that this fit to the benchmark data is due to\nthe extremely high slip values on panel 6. This produces\na vertical displacement high in an area where, on the\nground, there is a prominent gap between two offset\nTable 2.

Maps of vertical displacement are\ncontoured in meters. Model 1 fails to produce significant uplift in the hanging wall of panel 2. Model 2\npredicts an isolated high of vertical displacement where the benchmark route cuts the fault zone, yet this\nis not matched by observations. Model 3a predicts elongate zones of uplift in the immediate hanging\nwalls of the central fault panels, with a slightly less uplifted zone in between along the benchmark route;\nthis model provides the closest fit to the observations. Map projection for these, and all subsequent maps,\nis UTM (zone 31) with coordinates in kilometers.\nTC6005 HEALY ET AL.: FRACTURE PREDICTION FOR EL ASNAM VIA ED MODELING\n6 of 21\nTC6005\ntopographic ridges (the benchmark route follows a road\nand railway line through this gap).\n[18] The vertical displacements calculated from Model 3a\nare shown in Figures 3f and 4c. Displacement highs are\npresent in the hanging walls of the main fault panels and lie\nclose to the fault traces, matching the occurrence of hanging\nwall uplift in these areas. These highs result from increased\nslip on deeper panels combined with a sudden decrease in\nslip on the shallowest panels. A saddle in the predicted\nvertical displacement field is present along the central\nportion of the benchmark route, in contrast to Model 2.\nThe fit to the geodetic data is also good (Figure 4c),\nparticularly along the central benchmarks and predicted\nlack of footwall subsidence toward the NE.\n4.2. Elastic Dislocation Strains Due to Coseismic Slip\n[19] In addition to the displacement field, ED models\ncalculate the full strain tensor at each grid node. The\nvolumetric strain, or dilatation, D is defined as\nD \u00bc e1 \u00fe e2 \u00fe e3; \u00f03\u00de\nwhere e1, e2, e3 are the principal strains calculated as\neigenvalues of the symmetric part of the elastic strain tensor.\nLarge positive values of D represent significant volume\ngain, and large negative values correspond to significant\nvolume loss. Areas of extreme volumetric strain can be\nconsidered as more highly deformed and possibly therefore\nas more likely to be intensely fractured. Figure 5 shows the\ncontoured values of elastic volumetric strain for Models 1, 2\nand 3.\n[20] Models 1 and 3 both predict high dilatation (positive\nD) in the immediate hanging walls of the main reverse fault\npanels. These regions correspond to areas of extensional\nnormal faulting and tensile fissures which is consistent with\nthe predictions. The linear form of these extended\/tensile\nzones trending NE\/SW parallel and close (\u00061 km) to the\nreverse faults more closely matches the predictions of\nModel 3. Model 2 predicts high values of D in the central\ngap area (panel 6 on Figure 3c). On the ground, this area is\ncovered by alluvium and some strain may be concealed\nbeneath these recent sediments.\n[21] On the basis of our assessment of the fit between\nmodeled and observed vertical displacements and volu-\nmetric strain, subsequent model results are shown only\nfor our preferred Model 3. The orientation of the ED\nstrain field produced by Model 3 is shown in Figure 6\nfor a depth of 50 m. Note that throughout this paper our\nconvention for strains is e1 > e2 > e3 with elongation\nreckoned as positive, and shortening as negative. In\nthese maps, the orientations of the e1 and e3 principal\nstrains are depicted with a line symbol, where the\ndirection of the line represents the azimuth of the strain\naxis and the length of the line is inversely related to the\nplunge of the strain axis. A line of zero length therefore\nrepresents a vertical strain axis. Note therefore that the\nlengths of the lines carry no indication of strain magni-\ntude or sign. The background to each strain map shows\nthe volumetric strain. In Figure 6a, the maximum prin-\ncipal strain (e1) is approximately horizontal and normal\nto the main fault traces along the linear high strain\nzones in the hanging walls. In Figure 6b we can see that\nat these locations the minimum principal strain (e3) is\nsubvertical. These maps show that although the ED\nstrain field around the fault panels is heterogeneous,\nthere are systematic transitions between domains of\ndifferent strain orientation.\n4.3. Redistributed Stress, Overburden Stress, and\nRegional Stress\n[22] Assuming linear elasticity in an isotropic medium\nwe can derive the ED stress field from the ED strain\nfield using Hooke\u2019s Law, equation (1). To calculate the\nredistributed elastic stress field in the near-surface rocks\ndue to a coseismic slip increment within the underlying\nbasement, we use values for the shear rigidity Gs and\nfor the Lame\u00b4 constant ls (see Table 1) appropriate to\nfractured and chemically weathered rocks. The orienta-\ntions of the modeled principal ED stresses will match\nthose of the principal ED strains. The convention for\nstresses is s1 > s2 > s3 with compression reckoned as\npositive and tension as negative. For the ED deformation\nfield, e3 (minimum principal strain) corresponds to s1\nFigure 4. (a\u2013c) Graphs of observed (crosses) versus\ncalculated (dots) vertical displacements for each of the three\nmodels of Figure 3. Observations were made along 25\ngeodetic benchmarks (see maps in Figure 3). All values are\nsimply plotted for each benchmark along the route with no\nallowance for actual distance along the ground and these\ngraphs should not be considered as a true profile through the\nfault zone.\nTC6005 HEALY ET AL.: FRACTURE PREDICTION FOR EL ASNAM VIA ED MODELING\n7 of 21\nTC6005\n(maximum principal stress) and e1 (maximum principal\nstrain) corresponds to s3 (minimum principal stress).\n[23] The maximum Coulomb shear stress, MCSS [Jaeger\nand Cook, 1979] is defined as\nMCSS \u00bc tmax \b p 1\u00fe m2\n\u0001 \u0002\u0001 m \b smean\u00f0 \u00de\n\u0003 \u0004\n; \u00f04\u00de\nwhere tmax is the maximum shear stress ([s1 \u0001 s3]\/2), smean\nis the mean stress ([s1 + s3]\/2), and m is the coefficient of\ninternal friction (see Table 1). We choose to normalise\ncalculated MCSS values by the shear strength (C) of the\nrock. Then for a given stress state, the value of normalised\nMCSS reflects how far the rock is from its shear strength\n(cohesion); this is illustrated in Figure 7. Values of normal-\nised MCSS greater than 1 imply that the rock has failed and\nregions of extremely high normalised MCSS are expected to\nbe intensely fractured.\n[24] The orientations of s1 and s2 for the ED stress field\nat a depth of 50 m, resulting from Model 3, is depicted in\nFigure 8. The correspondence between the orientation of s1\nand e3 can be seen by comparing Figure 8a with Figure 6b.\nSimilarly, the regions of high normalised MCSS roughly\ncorrespond to the areas of extreme volumetric strain with\nlinear zones in the hanging walls of the panels in the central\nsegment. The most compressive principal stress s1 is sub-\nvertical in these high MCSS zones. In the high MCSS zones,\ns2 is oriented approximately horizontal and parallel to the\nfault panel traces (Figure 8b). In the Andersonian fault model\n[Anderson, 1951], the relative orientations of the principal\nstress directions with respect to the free surface control the\ntype of faulting. Normal faults result from s1 vertical and\ns2 and s3 horizontal. Strike-slip faults result from s1 and s3\nhorizontal with s2 vertical. In addition, the orientation of s2\nindicates the direction along which conjugate shear failure\nplanes intersect. Using a simple Andersonian scheme of fault\nclassification, the ED stress field of Model 3a is consistent\nwith normal faults and\/or tensile fractures in the immediate\nhanging walls of, and striking parallel to, the central fault\npanels.\n[25] Some of the minor fractures around El Asnam are\nobserved to penetrate to depths of 50 m\u2013100 m in gorges\nFigure 5. Maps of volumetric strain for the ED component of the deformation for each of the three\nmodels. Volumetric strain contours are capped at \u00b10.001 and are computed for a depth 50 m below the\nfree surface. Note the linear zone of predicted positive dilatation along the hanging wall of the central\nfault segments in Model 3a.\nTC6005 HEALY ET AL.: FRACTURE PREDICTION FOR EL ASNAM VIA ED MODELING\n8 of 21\nTC6005\ncutting through the topography created by the hanging wall\nanticlines. Therefore, in modeling the stress field responsible\nfor the observed fractures we need to consider the load due to\noverburden. Since the model is based on linear elasticity, we\nsuperpose the ED stress with a lithostatic overburden stress as\ndescribed above. Figures 8c and 8d show this combined\nstress field at a depth of 50 m. The normalised MCSS values\ntend to drop slightly (compare the extent of grey areas on\nFigures 8c\u20138d with those on Figures 8a\u20138b) because the\nmean stress is higher. This would imply less intense fractur-\ning with depth.\n[26] In modeling the total stress field controlling frac-\nture formation, a regional or tectonic stress component\nneeds to be considered. As described above, we use\nregional strain values from Ruegg et al. [1982] to\nestimate the orientation and magnitude of this regional\ncomponent to the total deformation. Figures 8e\u20138f show\na total stress field calculated by the linear superposition\nof ED, overburden (50 m) and regional stresses. The far-\nfield (i.e., away from the defined fault panels) is domi-\nnated by the regional stress component, as the ED stress\ncomponent weakens significantly away from the main\nfaults. In the near-field, the elastic stress perturbation to\nthe regional stress field is apparent. The regional far-field\nstress is clearly consistent with an overall reverse\/thrust\nfault in the Andersonian sense, but the elastic perturba-\ntions to the total field around the larger faults will modify\nthe orientation and type of smaller scale faulting. The\nlinear zones of high MCSS are still present in the\nhanging walls of the central segment coincident with\nsteep to subvertical s1 and subhorizontal NE striking\ns2. The regional and ED stress (strain) components tend\nto be of opposite sign, especially around the fault panels.\nThe area around the fault therefore experiences net stress\n(strain) relief; however, the ED strains in Model 3a\nassociated with the upper tip line are locally very high\nwhere the displacement on the panels falls of quite\nrapidly toward the surface. These locally high ED strains\ndominate over the regional strains and cause the high\nvalues in MCSS. The addition of the regional compres-\nsive stress field does not affect the predicted distribution\nof extensional structures in the near-field around the\nfaults, particularly in the hanging walls of the central\nfault segments.\n[27] The systematic modeling of the various stress\ncomponents allows us to assess their contribution to the\nFigure 6.

MCSS represents the\nintercept on the shear stress axis of the tangent to the Mohr\ncircle that is parallel to the failure envelope.

The stress field due to the combi-\nnation of ED and overburden alone is sufficient to\naccount for the mapped structures (compare Figures 8c\u2013\n8d with Figures 8e\u20138f ) and the regional stress compo-\nnent exerts no obvious control on the formation of\nsmaller scale fractures. Fractured and weathered near-\nsurface rocks probably do not sustain regional stresses\ni.e., they possess no long-term shear strength. An applied\nregional stress (e.g., from far-field plate convergence) will\nbe slowly dissipated at shallow levels due to slip on\nFigure 8. Maps of stresses in the subsurface; z = 50 m.

Therefore,\nat the time of the 1980 earthquake, the load on the near-\nsurface rocks would only have been due to the stresses\narising from the short-term elastic response to the coseis-\nmic slip (modeled by the ED stress component) and the\nweight of any overlying rock (modeled by the lithostatic\noverburden stress). Our models suggest that this simple\nstress field can successfully account for the distribution\nand mode of the observed fractures e.g., Figures 8c\u20138d.\nSpecifically, an extensional regime is predicted for the\nnarrow linear zones along the hanging walls of the central\nfaults matching the observed normal faulting and tensile\nfracturing in these areas. However, a failing of the current\nmodel (Model 3a) is that the NNE trending (i.e., oblique)\nnormal faults in the hanging wall anticline along Sera el\nMaarouf are not predicted. The orientation of s2 in our\nmodel of this region is parallel to the main reverse fault\ntrace, and predicted fractures would therefore strike NE.\nWe address this issue later (see below).\n4.4. Predicted Fractures Due to Redistributed and\nOverburden Stress\n[28] In order to predict fractures, we seek a model that\ncan account for their distribution, mode and orientation. The\ndistribution is likely to be controlled by stress magnitude\nand our maps depict fractured areas as those where the\nnormalised maximum Coulomb shear stress exceeds 1. The\nnext task is to identify the mode of failure, tensile or shear,\nbefore applying a particular failure criterion to calculate\nfailure plane orientation [e.g., Bourne and Willemse, 2001].\nTensile fractures can occur at a range of depths (not just in\nthe near surface) and predictive models which fail to\naccount for tensile failure cannot be complete [e.g., Maerten\net al., 2002]. However, the problem in assigning failure\nmode to stress states derived from elastic models is illus-\ntrated by Figure 9b.\n[29] This graph shows the total stress (ED + 50 m of\noverburden) states for all grid nodes in our Model 3a,\nexpressed as maximum shear stress versus mean stress\n(both normalised by the cohesive strength, 1 MPa). Even\nwith a reasonable failure criterion, e.g., with m = 0.6,\nlarge parts of the modeled rock volume are predicted to\nhave failed far in excess of the rock shear strength value.\nThe problem then is to decide which failure mode, tensile\nor shear, the rock mass encountered first in moving from\nan initial unfractured stress state to its final fractured\nstate. Bourne and Willemse [2001] approached this issue\nby calculating two measures of proximity to failure, one\nfor tensile failure (ctensile) and one for shear (cshear)\nfailure (see Figure 9a). These values are calculated for\nthe initial (preearthquake) and final (postearthquake)\nstress states, with negative values for c below the failure\nenvelope and positive values for c above the envelope.\nThe change in failure proximity for each failure mode is\ndefined as:\nDctensile \u00bc ctensilefinal \u0001 ctensileinitial \u00f05\u00de\nDcshear \u00bc cshearfinal \u0001 cshearinitial: \u00f06\u00de\nThe mode of first failure (if any) is then determined by\nthe following conditions:\nDctensile=ctensileinitialj j > Dcshear=cshearinitialj j \u00f07\u00de\nfor tensile failure, and\nDcshear=cshearinitialj j > Dctensile=ctensileinitialj j \u00f08\u00de\nfor shear failure. Note that the conditions in (7) and (8)\nmust use the absolute numerical values, as the initial c\nFigure 9. (a) Graph illustrating the concept of proximity\nto failure for both tensile (ctensile) and shear (cshear) modes.\nThe proximity to failure method of Bourne and Willemse\n[2001] is used to determine the failure mode at each grid\nnode. (b) Predicted ED + overburden stress states for our\npreferred Model 3, calculated at a depth of 50 m. Note that\nmany points exceed the example failure envelope, calcu-\nlated with a coefficient of internal friction mi = 0.6.\nMaximum shear stresses and mean stresses have been\nnormalised by the cohesive strength (1 MPa).\nTC6005 HEALY ET AL.: FRACTURE PREDICTION FOR EL ASNAM VIA ED MODELING\n11 of 21\nTC6005\nvalues in the denominators are usually negative (unfrac-\ntured) and therefore the comparison is between two\nnegative values.\n[30] Given the mode of failure, we use a standard\nCoulomb failure criterion [e.g., Jaeger and Cook, 1979]\nto compute the angle of failure planes with respect to the\nprincipal axes of stress at each grid node. For tensile failure,\nfracture planes will be oriented parallel to the s1-s2\nprincipal stress plane. For shear failure, conjugate failure\nplanes intersecting parallel to s2 make an angle q with s1\nwhere\nq \u00bc p=4\u0001 f=2 \u00f09\u00de\nand f is the angle of internal friction (tanf = m). We further\nclassify the shear failure planes on the basis of the orien-\ntation of their controlling principal stresses with respect to\nthe free surface according to a simple Andersonian scheme\n[Anderson, 1951] described in Table 3. The predicted\nfracture maps shown in Figure 10 have all been constructed\nfrom a stress field comprising ED and overburden compo-\nnents only. For our preferred model (Model 3a), the\nmajority of nodes where we predict failure involve the s2\nprincipal stress oriented subhorizontally. In these cases, the\nmap orientation (XY projection) of the s2 principal stress\ncan be used as a proxy for the strike of failure planes, either\ntensile or shear.\n[31] Figure 10 shows the distribution, mode and ori-\nentation of predicted fractures from Model 3a. The map\nin Figure 10a is a close-up of the area around panel 2\n(south central segment of the fault system) and shows\nfractures at the surface (z = 0, no overburden stress).\nThe strike of the predicted fractures is shown with a\nshort line symbol. The strikes are parallel to s2 for\ntensile, normal and reverse fractures, whereas for wrench\nfractures (s2 vertical) the true strikes of the conjugate\nshear failure planes are shown. Areas with no symbols\nare predicted to remain intact. A range of fracture types\n(modes and orientations) is predicted at the surface, with\ntensile fractures dominant in a narrow (\u00061 km) zone in\nthe hanging wall of panel 2. The tensile fractures strike\nbroadly parallel to the underlying reverse fault. This\npredicted pattern closely matches the mapping of Philip\nand Meghraoui [1983] (their Figure 14; see also our\nFigure 1c). The effect of overburden stress is illustrated\nin Figure 10c which shows the same area as Figure 10a,\nbut with predicted fractures at a depth of 50 m. Several\noblique faults are now present, as the principal stress\naxes have rotated with increased distance from the free\nsurface.\n[32] Figure 10b illustrates the predicted fractures at the\nsurface for the north central segment of the fault zone,\naround panel 3. Again the distribution and mode of\npredicted fractures corresponds closely to fractures in\nthe field. However, the predicted strikes of the tensile\nfractures do not match the detailed mapping in this area\nby Philip and Meghraoui [1983] (their Figure 17; see\nalso our Figure 1c). The strikes of the predicted fractures\nare not oblique to the main reverse fault trace (as\nobserved), but subparallel to it. A similar pattern can be\nseen in the predicted fractures for a depth of 50 m,\nshown in Figure 10d. This shortcoming of the current\nmodel (Model 3a) is addressed further below.\n5. Sensitivity Analysis\n[33] Acknowledging that all forward models are non-\nunique, the main controls on the solution quality of ED\nmodels are the inputs e.g., regional stress (magnitude and\ndirection), the chosen material parameters (elastic constants,\nrock strength values and friction), and the fault panel\nconfiguration (e.g., slip distribution). The predictions of\nour ED models are sensitive to the input material parame-\nters. In this section we present maps of the stress field, at a\ndepth of 50 m, to show the sensitivity to some of these\nparameters. The reference model for comparison with these\nparameter variations is shown in Figure 8f. A systematic\nsensitivity analysis allows us to explore other potential\ncontrols on fracture formation inherent within the geome-\nchanical model.\n5.1. Variations in the Regional Stress Field\n[34] Although we believe the regional stress field exerts\nno obvious control on the formation of smaller scale\nfractures, we have explored the effect of varying the\ndirection and magnitude of the regional stress. Figure 11a\nshows the combined ED, overburden and regional stress\nfield based on a uniaxial regional shortening strain of\n4.0 \u0007 10\u00014 which is twice the amount suggested by\nRuegg et al. [1982], at a depth of 50 m. The regional\nstress is now dominant with only very narrow zones of\nelastic perturbation around the fault panels (compare\nFigure 11a with Figure 8f ). In contrast, halving the\nregional strain value to 1.0 \u0007 10\u00014 (see Figure 11b)\nresults in a combined stress field dominated by the\ncoseismic elastic deformation around the faults.\n[35] Another possible source of uncertainty is the azimuth\nof the uniaxial shortening. Our initial modeling (e.g.,\nFigures 8e\u20138f ) used a direction of 140\u0001, consistent with\nmany field observations by previous workers. Figure 11c\nshows a combined ED, overburden (50 m) and regional\nstress field based on a uniaxial shortening (at the original\nmagnitude of 2.0 \u0007 10\u20134) aligned along 110\u0001. The elastic\nstress perturbation in the near-field is manifest in the\nchange in orientation of the principal stresses. While s2\naround panel 2 (south central segment) remains subparallel\nto the fault trace, around panel 3 a slight obliquity is now\nTable 3.

Using this azimuth for the regional\nuniaxial shortening results in the combined stress field\nshown in Figure 11d. The near-field elastic perturbation is\nFigure 10.

Variations in Material Parameters\n[36] The Young\u2019s modulus (E) linearly scales the pre-\ndicted strains and stresses and will affect the area and\nmagnitude of predicted failure. Figure 11e shows the\neffect on the stress field of increasing E from an original\nvalue of 5 GPa, believed to be appropriate for these\nNeogene age sediments, to 20 GPa. The increased areal\nextent of normalised MCSS greater than 1 reflects this\nquadrupling of stress magnitude, with regions around the\nfault panels exceeding a normalised MCSS value of 5.\nSuch areas are predicted to be intensely fractured or even\nbrecciated, and this is not supported by the field evidence.\nReducing the Young\u2019s modulus leads to a corresponding\nlinear decrease in the stress magnitude, shown in Figure 11f\nfor a value of 1 GPa. The maximum normalised MCSS\nvalue is now below 1, which would imply no new failure.\nOur original value of Young\u2019s modulus at 5 GPa appears\nvalid.\n[37] The coefficient of internal friction (m) was initially\nset to 0.6, following Byerlee [1978]. In our model, the value\nof m affects the distribution of fractures via the value of\nnormalised MCSS (equation (4)). The orientation of conju-\ngate shear failure planes about the principal compressive\nstress is also dependent on m (equation (7)). Figures 12a and\n12b show the effects of increasing m to 0.8 and decreasing m\nto 0.3, respectively. A higher value of m leads to a slight\nincrease in normalised MCSS, but neither map shows any\nmarked difference from the basic model in Figure 8. Our\nmodel is therefore not particularly sensitive to changes in m,\nand we prefer the original value of 0.6.\n[38] Finally, we consider the values for rock strength. Our\noriginal value (see Table 1) for the tensile strength (T0) was\n0.5 MPa, with the shear strength (C) set at 1 MPa. These\nFigure 12. Sensitivity analysis. Maps of normalised maximum Coulomb shear stress.

A higher tensile\nstrength of 10 MPa, with a corresponding increase of shear\nstrength to 20 MPa, results in low values of normalised\nMCSS (see Figure 12c) i.e., a prediction of a very low\ndegree of fracturing. By comparison, reducing T0 to\n0.05 MPa (and C to 0.1 MPa) leads to a significant increase\nin normalised MCSS, a prediction of intense fracturing or\nbrecciation (Figure 12d). Neither case seems warranted by\nthe field evidence, and we believe the initial value for T0 of\n0.5 MPa is more appropriate.\n5.3. Variations in Slip Distribution\n[39] As discussed above, our initial model (Model 3a)\nfails to predict the oblique strikes (NNE) of the normal\nfaults in the hanging wall of the north central segment. We\nnow explore the control of the prescribed slip distribution\non the predicted stress field and fracture pattern. Our initial\nmodel 3a (see Table 2) specifies uniform reverse slip values\non the three subpanels 3a, b and c. An alternative scenario\nmight involve a lateral (i.e., along strike) variation in slip on\nthese subpanels. Figures 13a\u201313b shows the predicted\nstress field using the slip values listed in Table 4, with a\nnortheastward decrease in reverse slip. The normalised\nMCSS now decreases toward the NE, suggesting less\nintense fracturing at the NE tip. The most compressive\nstress s1 is oriented subvertically along the high stress zone,\nconsistent with extensional fractures. However, the orienta-\ntion of s2 (proxy for fault strike) in the hanging wall\nremains subparallel to the reverse fault panel. Model 3b\ntherefore also fails to predict the NNE trending normal\nfaults.\n[40] There is some dispute as to the role of sinistral slip in\nthe 1980 event. Field evidence [Philip and Meghraoui,\n1983] has been interpreted as a significant component (of\nthe order of meters) of sinistral slip in producing the\nmapped surface breaks. Previous elastic dislocation models\n[Ruegg et al., 1982; Cisternas et al., 1982] have also used a\nsinistral slip component to achieve a fit between observed\nand modeled vertical displacements. Philip and Meghraoui\n[1983] propose a model (their Figure 41) involving oblique\nsinistral-reverse slip on the north central fault segment to\naccount for the NNE trending normal faults in the hanging\nwall. Over many earthquake cycles, the plate convergence\ndirection of 170\u0001 will probably lead to oblique slip on faults\nstriking 050\u0001. However, the primary field observations\nalong Sera el Maarouf from Yielding et al. [1981] (their\nFigure 4) clearly show that the slip vectors on the NNE\ntrending normal faults are parallel to the main reverse fault\nslip vector, i.e., along 140\u0001. In addition, these normal faults\nwere in existence before the 1980 earthquake, and have\nbeen reactivated by that event. Therefore the stress field\nresponsible for the initiation of these fractures need not be\nthe same as that of the 1980 event.\n[41] A feature of our preferred model thus far (Model 3a)\nis the sharp decrease in reverse slip values near the surface.\nThe shallowest panels (2c and 3c, see Table 2) in the central\nsegment are narrow in a downdip direction and carry only\nminor reverse slip values. This configuration produces the\nnarrow linear zones of uplift and high ED strain in the\nimmediate hanging walls of the panels 2 and 3. One\ninterpretation of this geometry is that it is an upward\npropagating reverse fault tip that has recently breached the\nsurface. At some time before the 1980 earthquake, the tip\nline of the reverse fault system in this segment would have\nbeen blind i.e., subsurface. In our final model (Model 3c,\nsee Table 5), panel 3c has been removed and the upper edge\nof panel 3b now represents the buried tip line, 0.7 km deep,\nof the reverse fault system. In addition, a small (3 m)\nsinistral slip component has been added to panel 3b. This\nresults in oblique (sinistral-reverse) slip on this panel, with a\nslip vector azimuth of 153\u0001 (as opposed to 130\u0001 on the\noriginal pure reverse slip model 3a). The consequences of\noblique slip on buried dislocations in an elasto-plastic\nmedium have recently been described by Bowman et al.\n[2003]. Model 3c confirms their findings that complex yet\nsystematic strain and stress patterns develop in the volume\nabove the buried fault. Figures 13c\u201313d shows the stress\nfield at a depth of 50 m with a blind panel 3 (tip-line buried\n0.71 km) and oblique sinistral-reverse slip. A narrow linear\nzone of high stress is present in the hanging wall and s1 is\nagain subvertical in this region. The small sinistral compo-\nnent of slip has a significant effect on the orientation of s2,\nwhich now trends NNE in a narrow zone approximately 1\u2013\n2 km behind the projected surface fault trace. Employing s2\nas a proxy for fault strike, this model can account for the en\nechelon NNE striking normal faults observed along Sera el\nMaarouf.\n[42] Changing the slip distribution will also impact the\npredicted vertical displacement field. Figure 14 shows\ncontour maps of the vertical displacement at the surface\nfor the region around panel 3 (north central segment) for\neach of the models 3a, b and c. The northeastward decrease\nin reverse slip in model 3b results in a tapering of the linear\nuplifted zone in the hanging wall (Figure 14b). Repeated\nslip events of this type would result in an anticline plunging\nmoderately to the NE, which is far in excess of the slight\nplunge observed. The oblique slip in model 3c maintains a\nlarge amount of uplift along the whole length of the hanging\nwall of panel 3 (Figure 14c). One or more previous, pre-\n1980, events involving oblique sinistral-reverse slip can\naccount for the NNE trending normal faults along Sera el\nMaarouf, which were then reactivated during the 1980\nreverse slip event. Figures 15a\u201315c show the predicted\nfractures for the pre-1980 oblique slip event, at the surface,\nat 50 m and at 100 m depth, respectively. NNE trending\ntensile fractures and oblique normal faults dominate, inter-\nspersed with wrench and other oblique fault combinations\nabove the blind fault tip-line. For comparison with the field\ndata, Figure 15d is a structural map of surface fractures\nalong Sera el Maarouf taken from Philip and Meghraoui\n[1983] (their Figure 17).\n6.

Some of the mapped\n\u2018\u2018minor\u2019\u2019 faults are now up to 1 km long, and presumably\nhave grown through many seismic cycles. The lack of any\nfracture dimensions in the model output remains a limita-\ntion, which could be addressed by using our results as input\nto discrete fracture modeling [e.g., Maerten et al., 2004].\n7. Summary\n[44] Forward modeling based on ED theory can predict\nthe distribution of small-scale fractures around larger faults.\nIn contrast to stochastic fault scaling methods, geomechan-\nical models based on ED theory predict the spatial distri-\nbution of small-scale fractures. The orientation of failure\nplanes can only be accurately predicted once the failure\nmode (tensile or shear) has been determined. For the ED\nmodels presented, much of the rock volume has far\nexceeded conservative estimates of the failure envelope\nand the determination of failure mode is achieved through\nthe method of Bourne and Willemse [2001]. A complex\ndistribution of different fracture modes, fault types and\norientations has been described by previous workers around\nEl Asnam. We have shown how the predictions from simple\nED models can be tested against these detailed field\nobservations. For example, a pure reverse slip model fails\nto predict the NNE trending normal faults in the hanging\nwall along Sera el Maarouf. However, a previous (pre-1980)\nincrement of oblique sinistral-reverse slip on a blind upward\npropagating fault panel can account for these surface\nfractures. The modeling technique presented in this paper,\nalthough simple, can predict the full range of observed\nfracture styles and orientations. The overall agreement\nbetween predicted and observed fractures lends confidence\nin the use of ED models in accurately predicting the\ncomplex deformation represented by secondary fractures\naround larger faults.\nTable 4.
