The uncertainty\ngenerated can result in late deliveries, order cancellations and an increased reliance on inventory to\nbuffer these effects. Despite the best efforts of organisations to stabilise the dynamics generated,\nindustry still experiences a high degree of uncertainty. The failure to significantly reduce uncertainty\nthrough traditional approaches may in part be explained by chaos theory.\nThis paper defines deterministic chaos and demonstrates that supply chains can display some of the\nkey characteristics of chaotic systems, namely: Chaos exhibits sensitivity to initial conditions, it has\n\u201cIslands of Stability\u201d, generates patterns, invalidates the reductionist view and undermines computer\naccuracy.\nThe implications for the management and design of supply chains are briefly discussed.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe term chaos is currently much used within the management literature. The term chaos has been\nused to describe the seemingly random disorder of customer demands for products (e.g. Womack and\nJones [1 p.81]) and by Tom Peters [2] in his book \u201cThriving on chaos\u201d to describe disorganised yet\nresponsive business structures that rapidly adapt and gain competitive advantage. Chaos is also used as\na metaphor to describe how a small change can be amplified to have a large effect on the system. This\nhas resulted from the popularisation of the \u201cbutterfly effect\u201d where a butterfly flapping its wings creates\ntiny changes in the atmosphere that result in the creation of a tornado a few weeks later [3]. Authors [1\np.87, 4]) describing amplification within the supply chain have used the term chaos in this context.\nUsing chaos as a metaphor for amplification within systems is an over simplification and can lead to\nmisunderstanding. It has been shown that chaos and amplification are linked yet distinctly different\ntypes of behaviour [5].\nChaos theory has been applied and found in a variety of systems including cardiac systems [6], stock\nmarket data [7] and the management of digital telephone exchanges [8]. Chaos is even being exploited\nin advanced washing machines to improve cleaning [9] and in the manufacturing quality control of\nsprings [10].\n\u201cChaos Theory: Implications for supply chain management.\u201d 4\nCHAOS\nThe Collins English dictionary describes chaos as meaning \u201ccomplete disorder and confusion\u201d.\nHowever, within this paper the term chaos describes deterministic chaos. The definition used in this\nwork is adapted from that proposed by Kaplan and Glass [11 p.27] and Abarbanel [12 p.15]:\nChaos is defined as aperiodic, bounded dynamics in a deterministic system with sensitivity\ndependence on initial conditions, and has structure in phase space.\nThe key terms can be defined as follows:\n\uf0b7 Aperiodic; the same state in never repeated twice.\n\uf0b7 Bounded; on successive iterations the state stays in a finite range and does not approach plus\nor minus infinity.\n\uf0b7 Deterministic; there is a definite rule with no random terms governing the dynamics.\n\uf0b7 Sensitivity to initial conditions; two points that are initially close will drift apart as time\nproceeds.\n\uf0b7 Structure in Phase Space; Nonlinear systems are described by multidimensional vectors.\nThe space in which these vectors lie is called phase space (or state space). The dimension of\nphase space is an integer [12]. Chaotic systems display discernible patterns when viewed.\nStacey [13 p.228] emphasises this by defining chaos as;\n\u201corder (a pattern) within disorder (random behaviour)\u201d.\nProfessor Ian Stewart proposes the following simplified definition [14 p.17]:\n\u201cStochastic behaviour occurring in a deterministic system\u201d.\nStochastic means random or lawless, deterministic systems are governed by exact unbreakable laws or\nrules. So chaos is \u201cRandom (or Lawless) behaviour governed entirely by laws!\u201d\nChaos is deterministic, generated by fixed rules that in themselves involve no element of chance (hence\nthe term deterministic chaos). In theory, therefore, the system is predictable, but in practice the non-\nlinear effects of many causes make the system less predictable. The system is also extremely sensitive\nto the initial conditions, so an infinitesimal change to a system variable\u2019s initial condition may result in\na completely different response.\nThis presents us with a good news \/ bad news scenario. The good news is that apparently random\nbehaviour may be more predictable than was first thought, so information collected in the past, and\nsubsequently filed as being too complicated, may now be explained in terms of simple rules. The bad\n\u201cChaos Theory: Implications for supply chain management.\u201d 5\nnews is that due to the nature of the system there are fundamental limits to the horizon and accuracy of\nprediction. Past patterns of system behaviour are never repeated exactly but may reoccur within certain\nlimits. For example the weather, a true chaotic system, has limits to the forecast horizon. Even if every\nvariable was known exactly the theoretical maximum forecast is 2 to 3 weeks [14].\nFor non-linear dynamic systems the assumption of one-to-one, cause and effect relationships implicit\nin most human logic do not hold. For chaotic systems, a tiny change in conditions may result in an\nenormous change in system output, whereas a substantial change in conditions may be absorbed\nwithout significant effect to the system\u2019s output.\nNON-LINEAR SYSTEMS AND CHAOS\nMathematicians have discovered that non-linear feedback systems, are particularly prone to chaos.\nInformation is fed back thus impacting on the outcome in the next period of time.\nJay Forrester proposes the following definition for a feedback system [15]:\n\u201c An information-feedback system exists when the environment leads to a decision\nthat results in action which affects the environment and thereby influences future\ndecisions\u201d\nThe process is continuous and new results lead to new decisions that keep the system in continuous\nmotion.\nAll logistics and supply chain management systems are made up of a series of feedback control loops.\nThis is the way the majority of business systems operate. Within logistics and supply chain\nmanagement a large proportion of the feedback loops are non-linear.\nFor example, the availability of inventory affects the shipment rate from a warehouse. When inventory\nis near the desired level, shipment rate can equal order rate but as inventory reduces the shipment rate\ncan become halted or checked by the amount of available inventory. This in turn leads to the issue of\n\u201cservice level\u201d.\nThe relationship between service level and cost to an organisation is depicted as a steeply rising curve.\nThis results from the high costs of carrying additional safety stock to cover those times of unexpectedly\nhigh demand.\nIt is therefore possible that the systems of control developed for managing the supply chain exhibit\nchaotic behaviour.\n\u201cChaos Theory: Implications for supply chain management.\u201d 6\nCHARACTERISTICS OF CHAOTIC SYSTEMS\nThere are five key characteristics of chaotic systems that have implications for supply chain\nmanagement. These are:\nChaos exhibits sensitivity to initial conditions\nThe characteristic of sensitivity is a central concept of chaos theory. However it should be emphasised\nthat sensitivity does not automatically imply chaos [16 p.512]. This misunderstanding is prevalent in\nmuch of the management literature and is linked to the popularisation of the \u201cbutterfly effect\u201d.\nSensitivity to initial conditions within chaotic systems is more distinct. Given a small deviation in\ninitial conditions, this small difference or error becomes amplified until it is the same order of\nmagnitude as the correct value. The amplitude of the error is magnified exponentially until there is no\nmeans of differentiating the actual signal from the signal generated by the error. This results in two\nsystems with starting conditions varied by a fraction of one percent producing outcomes over time that\nare totally different. The error propagation of the system results in the system being inherently\nunpredictable and therefore long term forecasting of such systems is generally impossible. This error\npropagation can be quantified by the use of Lyapunov Exponents.\nLyapunov exponents have proved to be one of the most useful diagnostic tools for detecting chaos. The\nexponent is a measurement of sensitivity to initial conditions. The maximum Lyapunov exponent can\nbe described as the maximal average factor by which an error is amplified within a system. A system\ncan be defined as chaotic if at least one positive Lyapunov exponent is present. If the maximum\nexponent is negative the system is stable or periodic [17].\nThe magnitude of the exponent gives a reflection of the time scale over which the dynamics of the\nsystem are predictable, so the exponent can be used to approximate the average prediction horizon of a\nsystem [17, 18]. After this prediction horizon has been reached the future dynamics of the system\nbecome unforecastable. This occurs because any small error is amplified so that the magnitude of the\ndynamics generated by the error exceeds the original dynamics being measured. This results in cause\nand effect relationship between current data and previous data becoming increasingly blurred and\neventually lost. The concept of prediction horizons can enable managers to differentiate between short\nand long term strategic decisions and also define a limit to which any forecasting is effective [19].\nThe sensitivity to initial conditions also results in dramatic changes occurring unexpectedly. Stable\nbehaviour can be followed by rapid change or a system behaving in a seemingly random manner may\nchange to a stable form of behaviour without any warning.\nThere are many sensitive systems that do not behave chaotically. A simple example of this is the\nequation:\n\u201cChaos Theory: Implications for supply chain management.\u201d 7\nX CXt t\uf02b \uf03d1 where C is a parameter much greater than 1.\nAny small error is magnified by a factor of C during each iteration. This system is sensitive to initial\nconditions but in no way can be defined as chaotic. The error will remain proportionally identical as\nthe system is iterated\nChaos has \u201cIslands of Stability\u201d.\nChaotic Systems are often related to aperiodic behaviour. Aperiodic behaviour is characterised by\nirregular oscillations that neither exponentially grow nor decay nor move to steady state [11 p.11].\nThese oscillations never repeat the same state twice. It is a behaviour that is neither periodic nor\nstochastic [12].\nChaotic systems typically can exhibit other domains of behaviour that may include stable convergent\nbehaviour, oscillating periodic behaviour, and unstable behaviour [20]. A system may be operating in\na stable manner but when a parameter is changed periodic or chaotic behaviour may be witnessed.\nAlso, it is also not uncommon for chaotic systems to spontaneously switch between different modes of\nbehaviour as the system evolves with time. Systems have been observed that will produce aperiodic\nbehaviour for a long period of time and then spontaneously \u201clock\u201d on to a stable periodic solution [21].\nIt is therefore possible for \u201cIslands of stability\u201d to be present in between areas of chaotic behaviour.\nThis characteristic has been harnessed for some chaotic systems, by changing a parameter so that the\nchaotic system can be controlled to produce more regular behaviour.\nChaos generates patterns.\nDespite the generation of apparently random data, chaotic systems produce patterns in the data. These\npatterns never repeat exactly but have characteristic properties. An example of this is a snowflake. The\nsnowflake is generated by deterministic relationships within the environment but tiny changes become\namplified. This results in every snowflake being different, but when observed it clearly belongs to the\ncategory of snow flakes. The patterns generated by systems are referred to as \u201cattractors\u201d.\nAn attractor can be defined as [12 p.199]:\n\u201cThe set of points in phase space visited by the solution to an evolution equation long\nafter (initial) transients have died out\u201d\nAttractors are geometric forms that characterise the long-term behaviour of a system in phase space\n[22]. Systems have a stable state, the state to which all initial conditions tend to gravitate; this state\nserves as an attractor. In classical systems, if the system gravitates towards a single point it is said to\nhave a point attractor, if it gravitates towards a stable cyclic response it has a periodic attractor, if the\nattractor results from a combination of 2 or more periods the system can be defined as a quasi-periodic\nattractor. The term \u201cstrange attractor\u201d is used to describe the shape of the chaotic patterns generated.\nThese strange attractors are a classic feature of chaotic systems [23].\n\u201cChaos Theory: Implications for supply chain management.\u201d 8\nTo understand the nature of chaotic attractors one needs to understand a simple stretching and folding\noperation. This results in a shuffling process being undertaken on the chaotic attractor, akin to a dealer\nshuffling a deck of cards. The randomness of the chaotic orbits is the result of this shuffling process\n[22]. The stretching and folding process can create patterns that reveal more detail as they are\nincreasingly magnified, these are referred to as fractals.\nWe cannot predict exactly the behaviour of chaotic systems, but by understanding the patterns\ngenerated some degree of prediction is possible. Chaos generates endless individual variety, which is\nrecognisably similar. As systems evolve with time recognisable patterns are generated. This property\nenables analysts to make some predictions about the system. One can predict the qualitative nature of\nthe patterns generated and the quantitative limits within which the pattern will move [13].\nChaos invalidates the reductionist view.\nOne consequence of chaotic systems is that in general the reductionist view becomes invalid. The\nreductionist view argues that a complex system or problem can be reduced into simple forms for the\npurpose of analysis [24]. It is then believed that the analysis of the individual parts gives an accurate\ninsight into the working of the whole system. This methodology of reductionism is also often applied\nto improvement within supply chain systems. The optimisation of the individual units, for example\nmanufacturing, purchasing, and distribution, is believed to result in the optimisation of the global\nsystem. Goldratt and Cox [25] demonstrated that in manufacturing environments this is often not the\ncase. One of the rules for manufacturing developed by Goldratt and Cox state:\n\u201cThe sum of the local optimums is not equal to the global optimum\u201d\nChaos theory states that a small change to an individual unit within a system may result in dramatic\neffects on the global system. These effects may not in all cases be beneficial to the operation of the\nglobal system.\nChaos undermines computer accuracy.\nEven simple equations can behave chaotically and these can have a dramatic effect on perceived\ncomputer accuracy. To demonstrate this phenomena a simple example will be described.\nThe example demonstrates chaos by iterating a simple equation using a standard spreadsheet package.\nThe simple equation to be iterated is as follows:\nX KXt t\uf03d \uf02d\uf02d12 1\nThis simple equation for certain values of K is chaotic. The use of spreadsheets to demonstrate chaos\nenables an accessible method to demonstrate the nature of such systems [26].\n\u201cChaos Theory: Implications for supply chain management.\u201d 9\nWhen K is 1 then a stable periodic orbit occurs, the system is attracted to a cycle of 0, -1, 0, -1. The\nequation is relatively stable up until K = 1.5 producing periodic behaviour or quasi-periodic behaviour.\nAt K = 1.5 chaos occurs and the dynamics become increasingly complicated as K increases. However,\nat K = 1.74 the system behaves chaotically but at K = 1.76 stable behaviour occurs. This stable\nbehaviour continues until K = 1.81 and then chaotic behaviour reoccurs. Therefore an \u201cisland of\nstability\u201d is present between K = 1.76 to 1.80.\nPLACE TABLE 1 HERE\nTable 1 shows the iteration of this equation when K = 2 on two different spreadsheet and hardware\nplatforms and two starting conditions differing by a tiny amount. It can be seen that after forty\niterations the results start to diverge rapidly. If K is greater than 2 the equation becomes unstable and\nthe solution approaches infinity.\nThis raises a fundamental issue about the impact of chaos on computer systems. An identical program\nrun on two different makes of computer, or different standard software packages doing the same\ncalculations can produce significantly different results [14 p.21].\nPeitgen [16 p.40] further emphasises this point by stating:\n\u201cMore and more massive computations are being performed now using black box\nsoftware packages developed by sometimes very well known and distinguished\ncenters. These packages, therefore, seem to be very trustworthy, and indeed they are.\nBut this does not exclude the fact that the finest software sometimes produces total\ngarbage, and it is an art in itself to understand and predict when and why this\nhappens. ...More decisions in the development of science and technology, but also in\neconomy and politics are based on large-scale computations and simulations.\nUnfortunately, we can not take for granted that an honest error propagation analysis\nhas been carried out to evaluate the results.\u201d\nIn the remainder of this paper each of these characteristics will be related to the supply chain. To\ndemonstrate some of these effects a number of supply chain simulations were used. These will now be\ndescribed.\nMETHODOLOGY\nThe research described below was undertaken by the author to gain an insight into the potential\ngeneration of chaos within warehouse supply chains.\n\u201cChaos Theory: Implications for supply chain management.\u201d 10\nChaos in warehouse supply chains.\nThe supply chains are characterised by automatic inventory control algorithms and EDI (electronic\ndata interchange) between the echelons. The supply chain structures simulated for the following\nexample can be seen in Figure 1. It is accepted that warehouse supply chains are in reality more\ncomplex but the model does capture the main components of such a system.\nPLACE FIGURE 1 HERE\nThe simulation approach used to investigate the non-linear dynamic behaviour of supply chains was a\ndevelopment of that created by Mike Wilson at Logistics Simulation Ltd. This software and approach\nto the simulation was chosen as it is used commercially as a training and strategic development tool by\na number of blue chip companies including ICI and Black & Decker [27]. It has been tested widely in\nindustry and is shown to mimic with good accuracy the characteristics of actual warehouse supply\nchains. The simulation has been subjected to rigorous validation by the author, engineers and scientists\nwithin the University of Warwick and also external practitioners and academics. The simulation\nenabled the generation of large quantities of \u201cclean\u201d data that could be used in any further analysis [5].\nThe investigations outlined in this paper were conducted using an automatic re-order algorithm within\nthe warehouse, which forecasts demand, calculates the optimum inventory cover level and places an\norder to account for expected demand for a given period. This is a widely used re-order and stock\ncontrol algorithm used in industry [28] [29 pp.105-107]. The simulation can monitor inventory levels\non a daily basis at all points of the chain. It also monitors the supply chain\u2019s ability to satisfy end\ncustomer demand.\nThe data used for analysis was the time series output of the apparent inventory level within warehouses\nin the simulated supply chain. This is the quantity of stock on hand minus any backorder not yet\nreceived from suppliers. This was used as it reflects well the inventory dynamics and has a direct\nrelationship to the order pattern generated by the warehouse.\nSearching for chaos\nThe tools for analysis of non-linear time series data are reasonably advanced and have been applied to\na variety of systems. The analysis techniques can be classified as either geometric or algorithm based.\nGeometric techniques include return maps and phase plots, algorithm based techniques include the\ncalculation of Lyapunov exponents and correlation dimensions that can be used to quantify the degree\nof chaos.\nFor the data to be characterised as chaotic it must be shown that the data satisfies the definition of\nchaos described above. A system is deterministic when future events are causally set by past events.\nEnsuring the data are bounded, aperiodic and sensitive to initial conditions can be quantified by using a\nnumber of standard tools. Standard statistical techniques can be used for checking that the data is\n\u201cChaos Theory: Implications for supply chain management.\u201d 11\nbounded. The calculation of Lyapunov exponents is a key technique for characterising chaotic\nbehaviour and quantifying sensitivity to initial conditions this also detects periodic behaviour.\nStructure in phase space can be distinguished by the use of geometric techniques.\nThe non-linear analysis methodology used in this work has been developed from methodologies\nproposed by Abarbanel, Kaplan and Glass, and Sprott and Rowlands [11, 12, 30]. A detailed\ndescription of the methodology is documented by Wilding [5].\nRESULTS\nThe results described below demonstrate that supply chains can display the characteristics of chaotic\nsystems that were described earlier in this paper.\nChaos exhibits sensitivity to initial conditions\nRigourous analysis of the time-series data generated by the supply chain simulation has found positive\npositive lyapunov exponents are present, thus indicating sensitivity to initial conditions [Wilding,\n1997b]. Figure 2 demonstrates the effect of sensitivity to initial conditions within warehouse 2 in a two\nwarehouse supply chain. This is a somewhat crude experiment; but it gives a useful insight into the\ndynamics. It can be seen that slightly differing initial stock levels over time results in the graphs\ndiverging. In the case where a small random input is placed over the initial demand the random input\nseems to temporarily stabilise the dynamics. However after a certain period a series of \u201cchaotic spikes\u201d\ncan be observed.\nPLACE FIGURE 2 HERE\nChaos has \u201cIslands of Stability\u201d.\nFigure 3 demonstrates the impact of changing the service level setting for warehouse 1 in a one-\nwarehouse supply chain at a daily demand level of 10. It can be seen that islands of stability occur at\napproximately 98.7% and 99.3% resulting in a prediction horizon of 10,000 days. At other service\nlevel settings such as 99.8% the prediction horizon is reduced to 100 days due to chaos being\ngenerated. This demonstrates that \u201cIslands of Stability\u201d can be found for different parameter settings.\nPLACE FIGURE 3 HERE\nChaos generates patterns.\nFigures 4 and 5 show the relationship between the inventory level in warehouse 1 and warehouse 2 and\n3 respectively. Each figure shows a distinctive pattern that never repeats precisely. This is typical of a\nchaotic system. A limited number of points has been plotted because as the number of points plotted\nincreases the pattern starts to fill up the phase space.\nPLACE FIGURES 4 & 5 HERE\n\u201cChaos Theory: Implications for supply chain management.\u201d 12\nChaos invalidates the reductionist view.\nFigures 6 and 7 also demonstrate how changing the supplier lead-time impacts on the prediction\nhorizon of the data series from the warehouses. These results reinforce the indications that a change in\na parameter within the supply chain impacts on all echelons in the chain. A particularly interesting\nfinding is that for the shortest supplier lead-time (3 days) the prediction horizon in warehouse 1 is\nsignificantly lower than that of the other lead-times. However in warehouse 2 no significant difference\nis seen. A possible explanation for this is that warehouse 2 carries less cover stock as the supplier lead-\ntime is shorter i.e. the algorithm calculates less stock is required as the supplier can deliver quickly.\nThis then results in warehouse 1 having less inventory buffer in the warehouse supplying it. Therefore\nif any uncertainty due to chaos occurs warehouse 1 is more liable to be impacted upon, resulting in\nincreased chaos and thus a reduced prediction horizon. This is an example of where the reduction of a\nlead-time (time compression) does not always result in improved dynamic behaviour for all players in\nthe supply chain. The change of a variable in one echelon of the supply chain may result in detrimental\nperformance in another echelon.\nPLACE FIGURES 6 & 7 HERE\nChaos undermines computer accuracy.\nAs demonstrated above deterministic chaos can be generated by simple equations in standard\nspreadsheets. The results of iterative calculations can be sensitive to both the hardware and software\nused to undertake the calculations. Increasingly, industry is investing in faster communication systems\nand is purchasing \u201cblack box\u201d packages for the management of key functions within the supply chain.\nThe human decision making process is increasingly being automated. The interaction of such systems\nhas to date seen little research. The dynamics of such systems are usually explored over a relatively\nshort period of time with performance monitored in detail for, say, 6 months after installation. This is\nan inadequate time frame to assess such systems. The potential for the system to produce chaos\nrequires the system to be monitored with care for much longer time periods. In theory, uncertainty\nwithin the supply chain could be caused by the algorithms being used operating under conditions that\ngenerate chaos.\nMANAGERIAL IMPLICATIONS.\nThe implications of this work are that a system which is meant to control and level fluctuations, and\nconsequently buffer the system from instability, can create dynamics which turn a stable predictable,\ndemand pattern into one which is unpredictable with occasional explosive changes in demand, so\nfurther destabilising the system. Thus a system designed to optimise stock holding and order\nmanagement can actually increase unpredictability and costs incurred across the total supply chain.\n\u201cChaos Theory: Implications for supply chain management.\u201d 13\nDeterministic chaos can be generated within supply chains. The increasing use of enterprise planning\nsystems which are often little understood by the managers using them leaves supply chains susceptible\nto uncertainty generated by chaos.\nSystems that generate chaos can also generate stable behaviour. A small change of a variable can\ncause the system to act in chaotic manner. This has been witnessed in the authors\u2019 investigations. For\ncertain levels of demand the model behaves in a stable manner but as demand is raised the system\nbecomes chaotic. By a further increase in demand the system becomes stable again. By searching for\nthese \u201cIslands of stability\u201d it may be possible to optimise batch sizes which reduce chaos. It may also\nexplain why a system that has been performing well for years becomes chaotic under new market\nconditions.\nRemoval of chaos\nThe key to the removal of chaos is the use of systems that do not have direct feedback loops.\nSimulations using simple re-order point systems do not produce chaotic behaviour as no feedback\nloops are present, however demand amplification has been shown to be a major drawback with this\ntype of system. Many lean approaches to manufacturing do not rely on complex feedback systems.\nFocusing on the uninterrupted flow and matching the pull from the customer, which is the basis of such\ntechniques, can be seen to eliminate feedback and consequently the conditions required producing\nfurther chaos. However, the misapplication of lean manufacturing, such as wholesale reduction of\ninventory and lead-times, can result in the system exhibiting increased chaos. One characteristic of\nchaotic systems is that they can perform in a counter intuitive manner. The study outlined above\ndemonstrates that the reduction of a supplier lead-time which is known to reduce demand amplification\nresulted in an increase in chaos [5].\nManagement within a chaotic system\nKey implications for management operating within a chaotic system are [19]: -\n\uf0b7 Dramatic change can occur unexpectedly. Chaotic spikes in demand can occur which are\ngenerated by the system and not as the result of external events.\n\uf0b7 Long term planning is very difficult. If long-term plans are made they need to be reviewed on a\nregular basis.\n\uf0b7 Supply chains do not reach stable equilibrium. Small perturbations will always prevent\nequilibrium being achieved.\n\uf0b7 Short-term forecasts and prediction of patterns can be made. It is better to allocate resource to the\ndevelopment of effective short-term decision making processes rather than long term.\n\u201cChaos Theory: Implications for supply chain management.\u201d 14\n\uf0b7 Treat the supply chain as a complete system. Small changes made to optimise one echelon of the\nsupply chain can result in massive changes in other parts of the supply chain. Driving down\ninventory and lead-times may not always improve performance; it could result in the system\nslipping into chaos.\n\uf0b7 Remove chaos by focusing on the customer; communicate demand information as far upstream as\npossible, use simple lean approaches.\n\uf0b7 When changing hardware or software platforms, which are critical to your organisations operation,\nundertake detailed validation. Computers are prone to chaos.\n\uf0b7 Simulation of systems and non-linear dynamic analysis of key outputs should be a mandatory part\nof any supply chain re-engineering proposal. Search for \u201cIslands of stability\u201d. Remember that if a\nsimplified model of the system generates chaos the real system with increased complexity will\nalso.\nCONCLUSION.\nThis paper has demonstrated that a simple supply chain can exhibit the characteristics of a chaotic\nsystem. Chaos generation contributes to the uncertainty experienced within the supply chain. It should\nbe recognised that this is one of a number of sources of uncertainty that contribute to the total dynamics\nexperienced by managers within supply chains. Wilding [5] describes the trade-off between\ndeterministic chaos, demand amplification and what are described as \u201cParallel Interactions\u201d, which\noccur between suppliers in the same tier in the supply chain. All three effects combine to create the\ntotal uncertainty experienced. In some supply chains the contribution of deterministic chaos to\nuncertainty may be small, while in others it may make a significant contribution to the total uncertainty\nexperienced.\nQuantitative techniques are going to become increasingly important for logisticians to master. Chaos\ntheory has already created a revolution in many areas of science. Traditional viewpoints have been\nchallenged and a greater understanding gained. The application of chaos to supply chains will\nundoubtedly generate a similar response in the field of supply chain management.\nAcknowledgements\nThe author would like to thank Mike Wilson and his team at Logistics Simulation Ltd., Poynton, UK for\ntheir support of this research.\n\u201cChaos Theory: Implications for supply chain management.\u201d 15\nReference List\n[1] Womack, James P., and Daniel T.
