The target content is (i)\ne-prints \u2013 digital copies of academic research\narticles published in subscription-based\njournals that are made available online to\npermit increased access; and (ii) articles\npublished in open access journals. The\nproposed service would provide immediate\nand maximal access to scholarly research,\nsupplementing the more limited access\nprovided by subscription-based journals, in\nturn maximizing the impact of research.\nOther benefits accrue from such a system\ntoo.

A nationally organized service in\nthe UK for the delivery of e-prints and open\naccess journal content to the scholarly\ncommunity would therefore be an important\ndevelopment.\nThere are two ways for researchers to\nprovide open access for their work \u2013 by\npublishing their articles in open access\njournals (or in hybrid journals that will\nprovide open access to individual articles\nfor a publication fee) or by depositing\n(\u2018self-archiving\u2019) copies (\u2018e-prints\u2019) of their\nsubscription-journal articles in open archives\n(known variously, depending on circum-\nstances, as e-print archives, institutional\narchives or institutional repositories). Al-\nthough often used interchangeably, we use\nthe term \u2018institutional archive\u2019 here in\npreference to \u2018institutional repository\u2019.

A \u2018harvesting\u2019\nmodel is recommended, where the metadata of articles\ndeposited in distributed archives are harvested, stored and\nenhanced by a national service. This model has major\nadvantages over the alternatives of a national centralized\nservice or a completely decentralized one. Options for the\nimplementation of a service based on the harvesting model\nare presented.\nLearned Publishing (2005)18, 25\u201340\nPaul Needham\nAlma Swan\nDeveloping a model for e-prints and open access journal content in UK further and higher education 25\nL E A R N E D P U B L I S H I N G V O L . 1 8 N O . 1 J A N U A R Y 2 0 0 5\nin many official names (e.g. Institutional\nArchives Registry, Open Archives Ini-\ntiative) and in part because it reflects an\nactivity (authors \u2018self-archive\u2019 their work \u2013\nthey do not \u2018self-reposit\u2019). Most importantly,\nthough, the use of the term repository is now\ngenerally coming to denote something more\nthan an e-print archive; rather, an insti-\ntutional collection of material that contains\nfar more than e-prints, such as grey literature,\ninstitutional-specific digital collections and\nso on. Since the remit of our study was to\ndevelop a model for the delivery and\nmanagement of e-print and open access\njournal content only, the term institutional\narchive is the most accurate and appropriate.\nThe JISC commissioned the study as part\nof an overall programme on open access\nin the UK and beyond. The brief was to\nforecast a delivery, access and management\nmodel for e-prints and open access journal\ncontent within the UK further and higher\neducation communities. The study took\nplace during the same period as the inves-\ntigation into scholarly scientific publication\nby the UK House of Commons Select\nCommittee on Science & Technology1 and\nthe two reported almost simultaneously.\nThey were followed very shortly thereafter\nby the recommendations of the National\nInstitutes of Health in the USA.2\nAn article that summarizes all the findings\nof our study, including preservation issues,\nlegal issues and some aspects of the costs\ninvolved in setting up and running e-print\narchives, is in press3 and the full report has\nbeen published by the JISC.4 This present\narticle specifically focuses on the model we\ndevised and the reasons why we chose this\none above the other possible options.\nThe open access material to be delivered\nFor the purposes of the study (and for this\narticle) an e-print was defined by the JISC as\n. . . a digital duplicate of an academic\nresearch paper that is made available\nonline as a way of improving access to the\npaper. E-prints are divided into preprints\n(papers that are circulated before they\nhave been formally approved for pub-\nlication), and postprints (papers that have\nbeen approved for publication).\nIt was specified that the model should\nencompass both e-prints and the content of\nopen access journals (where this can be\nharvested). Harvestable articles \u2013 both\ne-prints and open access journal articles \u2013\nare those that are OAI-compliant, that is,\ntheir metadata (bibliographic records) are\nexposed in the form laid down in the Open\nArchives Initiative Protocol for Metadata\nHarvesting (OAI-PMH).5 So long as their\nexposed metadata are OAI-compliant, they\ncan be harvested by OAI service providers\nwhose databases are then searchable by\nusers who are pointed at articles of interest,\nwherever those articles reside. There are a\nnumber of OAI service providers in exist-\nence. Perhaps the best known examples\nare OAIster6 (University of Michigan) and\nCitebase7 (University of Southampton).\nUsers type in a search term (author name,\nkeyword, etc.); the software searches meta-\ndata already harvested from all available\nopen access OAI-compliant archives, and\nreturns a list of appropriate articles with\nlinks to their full text. Users then access the\nfull text at its original location.\nWith respect to open access journals, the\ncurrent situation (Oct 2004) is that the\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ8)\nlists 1,277 titles, of which 324 are harvest-\nable at the article level. Most, but not all,\nof these titles are published by BioMed\nCentral9 or the SciElo10 project.\nExisting e-print material resides in open\narchives which can take two forms \u2013 central-\nized, subject-based archives, or distributed\narchives located at research-based institu-\ntions around the world. Two well-known\nand long-established examples of subject-\nbased archives are arXiv,11 set up in 1991\nand covering physics, mathematics and related\ndisciplines; and Cogprints12, set up in 1997\nand covering cognitive sciences (psychology,\nneuroscience, linguistics and related areas).\nSome figures may help to illustrate activ-\nity in these two subject-based archives. arXiv\ncurrently houses some 300,000 digital items\nand is accessed approximately 1.5 million\ntimes per month by users. Cogprints cur-\nrently contains around 2,000 items. Almost\nrepository is\nnow generally\ncoming to\ndenote\nsomething\nmore than an\ne-print archive\n26 A. Swan et al.\nL E A R N E D P U B L I S H I N G V O L . 1 8 N O . 1 J A N U A R Y 2 0 0 5\nhalf of these (985) are postprints (journal\narticles that are either published or in press);\nthere are also 377 preprints, 283 conference\npapers, 44 conference posters and 234 book\nchapters.\nAs well as subject-based e-print archives,\ndistributed broad-based archives have been\nset up in universities and research institu-\ntions around the world. There are now\nseveral hundred of these. OAIster is\ncurrently harvesting from 351 archives\n(institutional, subject-based and open access\njournal archives) and has over 3.5 million\nrecords in its database. Not all of these\nrecords will be e-prints, however, as OAIster\nharvests other types of digital object as well\n(see below) and from archives that do not\ncontain e-prints.\nThe Institutional Archives Registry13\ncurrently lists 227 archives housing e-prints\n(along with other types of digital object in\nmany cases); 33 of these are in the UK. Of\nthe total, 121 are archives that are based at\nan individual institution and contain research\noutput material (i.e. e-prints) and their\ncontent generally reflects the broad scope of\nscholarly activity at those institutions; that\nis, it covers many subject areas. Some are\nsub-institutional or departmental archives,\nhowever, which usually cover a single\nsubject or discipline. Of the total number,\n32 are archives with e-print content but\nwhich are cross-institutional and in general\nthese tend to be subject-based, though not\nexclusively, since there are some broad-\nscope archives formed by collaborating\ninstitutions. An example of this type is the\nWhite Rose Consortium e-Prints Repository,\na collaborative project by the universities of\nYork, Sheffield and Leeds.\nIn May 2004 there were just short of\n25,000 articles in the 20 e-print archives\nharvested by the RDN\/e-Prints UK14 project.\nOne had no articles at all while at the other\nextreme the open access publisher BioMed\nCentral\u2019s archive contained over 12,000\nfrom the circa 120 journals it publishes.\nBy far the best-populated university-based\narchive is the University of Southampton\u2019s\nECS EPrints service with 8143 articles. Two\nother Southampton-based archives also had\nreasonably high numbers of articles: e-Prints\nSoton had 758, and Psycprints (a journal\narchive) had 720.\nThe types of digital object collected and\nstored in archives\nWhile some archives concentrate only on\ne-prints, others may house a considerably\nvaried selection of digital objects, some of\nwhich may be very specific to local require-\nments. For our study, the JISC had specified\nthat it required models for the access and\ndelivery of just two types of digital object \u2013\ne-prints (preprints and postprints) and open\naccess journal articles. These are shown in\nbold type in the list below. Nevertheless, we\nkept in mind that other types of object are\narchived and that in time the inclusion of\nthese other types of object might be deemed\ndesirable. Some examples of the types of\ndigital item that might be stored in archives\nset up by UK educational institutions are:\n\u0001 Preprints\n\u0001 Postprints\n\u0001 All drafts and working papers plus\ncorrigenda (i.e. a trail from first draft to\nthe postprint: this is sometimes referred to\nas the \u2018low threshold\u2019 model)\n\u0001 Ancillary data from research, e.g. video,\naudio, large datasets. Some archives\naccommodate these types of data, which\ncannot be published in a traditional peer-\nreviewed print journal, because there is\nmerit in them being made available to\nother researchers, and in being preserved\ndigitally in a formal way\n\u0001 Books and monographs\n\u0001 Non-published digital objects:\n\u2013 Teaching materials\n\u2013 Collections (music, images, etc.)\n\u2013 Research output from specialised sub-\nject fields, such as performing arts, where\noutput is usually in the form of perfor-\nmance, video or audio\n\u2013 Dissertations and theses\n\u2013 Multimedia items\n\u2013 Local institutional \u2018events\u2019, e.g. perfor-\nmances, lectures, exhibitions\n\u0001 Open access journal articles\nAlthough the scope of the study did not\ninclude \u2018grey literature\u2019, we were certain that\nit should not be ignored, not least because\nbroad-based\narchives have\nbeen set up in\nuniversities\nand research\ninstitutions\naround the\nworld\nDeveloping a model for e-prints and open access journal content in UK further and higher education 27\nL E A R N E D P U B L I S H I N G V O L . 1 8 N O . 1 J A N U A R Y 2 0 0 5\nLondon Book Fair col ad\nCharlesworth col ad.\npreprints submitted to journals and then\nsubsequently rejected may end up forming a\npermanent piece of grey literature (in fact,\nthe DAEDALUS project formally groups\npreprints with grey literature15). Conversely,\nmany e-print archives contain much content\nin the form of reports (conventionally classed\nas grey literature) despite many definitions\nlimiting e-prints to preprints and postprints.\nAlthough grey literature was outside the\nscope of the study, we addressed it for the\nreasons above. Readers of this article may\nfind a useful introduction to the grey liter-\nature landscape in the UK in the MAGiC\n(Managing Access to Grey Literature\nCollections) Final Report.16 In short, the\nMAGiC project, which was sponsored by the\nBritish Library and the Research Support\nLibraries Programme, was proposed to deal\nwith the paucity of grey literature cataloguing\nand proposed the creation of a national grey\nliterature service built around the OAI\nharvesting model, which would incorporate\nboth electronic and hardcopy (legacy) docu-\nments.\nThe form and format of digital objects\ncollected and stored\nFor the purpose of our study an e-print was\ndefined as an article published in the schol-\narly literature, given away free by its author.\nIn other words the objects archived are\ngoing to be, in the main, standard journal\narticles, perhaps accompanied in the archive\nby additional supporting material such as the\nlarge datasets generated in some branches of\nthe sciences, or video or audio clips.\nIn some disciplines, however, research\noutput may frequently take other forms. For\ninstance, in the performing arts output is\noften in the form of a performance. In this\ncontext this presents additional issues for\nthe archiving of research results: video\nrecords of performance use large amounts of\ndigital storage space, for example. In the arts\nand humanities, too, although scholars do\npublish work in traditional journals, there is\nalso a large volume of output in the form of\nmonographs. These may be archived in the\nsame way as journal articles, but there may\nbe certain differences. Monographs may\nhave multiple authors, each contributing a\nchapter and possibly from different institu-\ntions, perhaps requiring separate deposition\nand submission policies. In general, too,\nmonographs tend to be much larger docu-\nments than journal articles, so there is again\na space implication. Finally, it is fairly\ncommon for monograph authors to be paid\nroyalties by the publisher and though these\nare usually small, they nonetheless represent\npayment, so in these cases this is not\n\u2018giveaway\u2019 literature.\nThe range of data formats permitted by\nexisting e-print archives varies from one\narchive to another. Many e-print archives,\nfor example the University of Oxford\u2019s\nOxford E-Prints, upload text-based docu-\nments only in PDF format, whereas another\nexample, the University of Glasgow\u2019s\neprints@Glasgow, accepts (and stores)\ndigital objects in a much wider range of\nformats.\nThe global picture\nThere is something of a global race taking\nplace with respect to achieving open access\nvia national policies on self-archiving.\nInitiatives are in place in India, Norway,\nThe Netherlands, Germany, Canada, Scot-\nland and France, among others, of which\nAustralia is an exemplar: the government\ngave funds of AU$12 m. in Oct 2003 to\nmake \u2018Australia\u2019s research information . . .\nmore easily accessible and better managed\u2019.17\nThe country\u2019s major research universities all\nhave institutional archives, and the Depart-\nment for Education, Science and Training\n(DEST) has decided that a national linked-\nup approach is the best way forward. It now\nsupports four projects covering 15 Australian\nuniversities, Australian and international\nlibraries, representatives from industry and\nvarious international organizations. The\nAustralian Partnership for Sustainable\nRepositories (APSR) has been set up and is\nworking through the Australian National\nUniversity\u2019s Centre for Sustainable Digital\nCollections to develop a national research\ninfrastructure through broad, archive-based\narchitecture which will ensure access con-\ntinuity and the sustainability of digital\ncollections, and facilitate national co-ordin-\nation and international linkages.\nthe creation of\na national grey\nliterature\nservice\n30 A. Swan et al.\nL E A R N E D P U B L I S H I N G V O L . 1 8 N O . 1 J A N U A R Y 2 0 0 5\nThe e-print situation in the UK\nThere are some projects and programmes\nalready in operation related to national\ndelivery of e-prints in the UK. The situation\nis promising but lacks co-ordination, con-\nsisting of a series of linked pilot projects and\na number of already established institutional\ne-print archives and, as yet, no involvement\nin e-print archiving by the British Library.\nThere are three particularly significant\nnational initiatives operating.\nePrints UK\nThe ePrints UK18 project is developing a\nseries of national, discipline-focused services\nfor e-prints from compliant open archive\nrepositories, particularly those provided by\nUK universities and colleges. The interface\nwill be provided through OCLC and will use\n\u2018name authority\u2019 and \u2018citation analysis\u2019\nWeb services (offered by OCLC and the\nUniversity of Southampton, respectively) to\nenhance the metadata harvested from\navailable archives. With respect to the study\nwe are reporting here, it is significant that\nePrints UK already also harvests metadata\nfrom a number of e-journal repositories,\ndemonstrating that integration of metadata\nfrom journal articles and e-prints is a\npractical and achievable proposition.\nSHERPA\nThe SHERPA19 project is initiating the\ndevelopment of openly accessible institu-\ntional digital collections of research output\nin a number of universities. Among the\nissues the project is investigating are intel-\nlectual property rights, quality control, other\nkey management issues associated with\nmaking the research literature freely\navailable to the research community and\ntechnical aspects of such a system, including\ninteroperability between repositories and the\ndigital preservation of e-prints.\nFAIR\nThe Focus on Access to Institutional Re-\nsources20 programme, funded by the JISC,\nhas a mission \u2018to evaluate and explore\ndifferent mechanisms for the disclosure and\nsharing of content (and the related chal-\nlenges) to fulfil the vision of a web of\nresources built by groups with a long term\nstake in the future of those resources, but\nmade available to the whole community of\nlearning.\u2019 The JISC Information Environ-\nment is a virtual location where authors can\ndeposit and share useful content (e.g.\nresearch outputs) and it is envisaged that\nthis will join the current collection of JISC-\nfunded content, which has the potential to\ninclude externally generated content from\npublishers and aggregators as well.\nOther issues pertaining to a model for a\nnew service in the UK\nThere were other issues to investigate and\nconsider as we deliberated on the develop-\nment of a suitable model. These fell into two\ncategories \u2013 technical and \u2018cultural\u2019 \u2013 and\nare summarized below.\nTechnical issues\nThe technical aspects we considered were:\nSoftware\nShould a new system run on one of the\navailable software packages or should a new,\nbespoke package be developed? There are\nseveral open-source (free) software packages\navailable for running open archives. The\nbest known are DSpace, developed by MIT,\nand EPrints, developed at Southampton\nUniversity. Both Eprints and DSpace offer\ninteroperability via the OAI-PMH. DSpace\nuses persistent identifiers that, unlike ordin-\nary URLs, do not change when the physical\nlocation of the digital item alters. Other\nOAI-compliant software systems of note are\nCDSware, developed by CERN; and Fedora,\ndeveloped jointly by the University of\nVirginia and Cornell University, with fund-\ning from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation\nPreservation policies\nAmong the various issues that we identified\nhere as having implications for a national\ne-prints service were: what should happen if\nan author wishes to withdraw an article;\nhow to handle and track repeated revisions\nof an article after it is first deposited; and\nwhat should\nhappen if an\nauthor wishes\nto withdraw\nan article\nDeveloping a model for e-prints and open access journal content in UK further and higher education 31\nL E A R N E D P U B L I S H I N G V O L . 1 8 N O . 1 J A N U A R Y 2 0 0 5\nPortland press col ad\nwhat constitutes the final version and how\nthis can be indicated.\nThe technical costs and resources involved in\nestablishing archives\nFrom this technical viewpoint, the main\ncosts will arise from the initial outlay on IT\nequipment and staffing, and from ongoing\ncosts for these. At this stage it was difficult\nto assess potential costs for a new agency\nsince we had no idea of the structure and\noperational requirements of such a body.\nWe did, however, determine the real costs of\nsetting up and maintaining archives at four\nuniversities, which would provide the JISC\nwith approximate-figure data on the nation-\nwide cost of establishing e-print archives at\nall higher and further education institutions.\nThese figures are shown in Table 1. All costs\nare approximate, due to currency conver-\nsions, and are rounded.\nCultural issues\n\u2018Cultural\u2019 includes political and business-\nrelated issues in this context. There has\nbeen some useful discussion already in the\nliterature suggesting that cultural change\nwill be necessary before self-archiving\nbecomes the norm.21 Some of the more\nconcrete issues that we needed to take into\naccount were the following.\nInstitutional attitudes to archives\nAlthough there are a number of institutions\nin the UK that have set up archives, most\nresearch-led establishments have not yet\ndone this. The likelihood of them doing so,\nand within a reasonable period of time, was\npertinent to which model we finally decided\nupon. There are several advantages to insti-\ntutions in establishing open access archives.\nFirst, open access accelerates and enhances\nthe impact of scholarly research.22 Second,\nit enables improved methods of impact\nmeasurement and analysis which in turn can\ngenerate better scientometric performance\nindicators for research productivity, usage\nand impact. Third, it also enables the\ngeneration of standardized online CVs for\neach institution\u2019s researchers and these can\nbe used for internal as well as external (such\nas the UK\u2019s national Research Assessment\nExercise23) evaluation purposes. Fourth, it\nhelps to monitor and enable the fulfilment\nof any research-council funding require-\nments. Also, at the same time as we reported\nour study in full, the recommendations of\nthe House of Commons Select Committee\non Science & Technology were published1\nand these include the following points:\n43. Institutions need an incentive to set\nup repositories. We recommend that the\nrequirement for universities to dissem-\ninate their research as widely as possible\nbe written into their charters. In addition,\nSHERPA should be funded by DfES to\nallow it to make grants available to all\nresearch institutions for the establishment\nand maintenance of repositories.\n44. Academic authors currently lack\nsufficient motivation to self-archive in\ninstitutional repositories.

Support\n\u2013 tacit or actual \u2013 from the pro-vice\nchancellor (PVC) or provost responsible for\nresearch policy is crucial.\nAuthor inertia is the main enemy of an\ne-print archive once it is established. The\nalternative to the \u2018author chooses to comply\u2019\nmodel is to mandate self-archiving. To date,\nthere are a few educational institutions that\nhave gone so far as to mandate that their\nauthors deposit copies of all their research\narticles in the institutional e-print archive.24\nThere are also examples of departmental\nmandates, one such being the School of\nElectronics and Computer Science at the\nUniversity of Southampton, which has\nproduced a policy that could be used by\nother departments travelling the same\nroute.25 To allay fears about the process of\nself-archiving and its legality, Eprints.org has\nproduced a FAQ26 and a handbook27 on the\nsubject.\nThe agreements that authors have with\npublishers and with archives\nAre there any restrictive licensing arrange-\nments with publishers or exclusive agreements\nwith archives that hamper or deter author\nself-archiving activity? Many publishers\nhave now officially endorsed the practice of\nauthors self-archiving the articles published\nin their journals in the author\u2019s own insti-\ntutional archive. At the time of writing, over\n70% of the (103) publishers surveyed by\nEprints.org have adopted this policy,28 and\n92% of the (8853) journals surveyed are\n\u2018green\u2019 (i.e. they endorse author self-archiving\nof either the preprints or postprints of\narticles).29\nThe management costs and resources involved in\nestablishing archives\nThese include the staff resources required\nfor planning, promoting and training. Hard\ndata were difficult to come by, largely\nbecause in institutions where archives have\nbeen established these sorts of costs have\nbeen absorbed into existing activities and\nprovisions, but it was clear from our dis-\ncussions that there is a real and non-negligible\ncost element here.\nWith this background information in place,\nwe set about determining the candidate\nmodels for e-print delivery, management\nand access.\nThe models we considered\nThere are three basic models that can sup-\nport access to metadata and the associated\nscholarly digital resources:\n\u0001 Centralized model both metadata and the\nresources themselves are deposited directly\nin a central archive.\n\u0001 Distributed model \u2013 all metadata and\nresources remain in their source archives,\nand metadata are cross-searched \u2018on the\nfly\u2019.\n\u0001 Harvesting model (a hybrid model) \u2013\nmetadata are harvested into a central\nsearchable archive but also remain dis-\ntributed among the original archives.\nThe centralized model\nIn this model, users (authors) deposit their\ne-prints in a central archive. This would\nhave a service provision component of its\nown, providing the interface through which\nusers (readers) search, browse and retrieve\nthe articles they require. The metadata of\narticles in the archive would also be exposed\nvia OIA-PMH (and any other protocols that\nplay the same role; specifically, in our study,\nwe also included RSS and SRW\/SSU as\npossibilities in this respect) for use by other\nservice providers. The configuration of this\nmodel is shown in Figure 1.\na real and\nnon-negligible\ncost element\nhere\n34 A. Swan et al.\nL E A R N E D P U B L I S H I N G V O L . 1 8 N O . 1 J A N U A R Y 2 0 0 5\nThe distributed model\nUnder this model, the service would search\nall available archives, metadata would be\nobtained in real time as the user made\nhis\/her request, and the user would be\npointed at the digital resource (the article)\nlocated in its distributed archive. The model\nis configured as in Figure 2.\nThe \u2018harvesting\u2019 model\nUnder this model, the proposed new UK\nservice (the service provider) would harvest\nand store metadata from available e-print\narchives and open access journals (the data\nproviders), using the OAI-PMH. It would\nhave a service provision component of its\nown, which would provide the interface\nthrough which readers would search, browse\nand retrieve articles. We included an\nadditional element here \u2013 the metadata from\nthese articles would also be exposed via\nOAI-PMH, SRW\/SRU and RSS for use by\nother service providers. Figure 3 illustrates\nthe harvesting model diagrammatically.\nA detailed account of the technical\nrequirements of each of the models appears\nin an appendix to the full report.4\nEach of these models had arguments for\nand against it. We needed to weigh these up\nbefore we settled on which model would be\nbest for a new UK e-prints service to adopt.\nIn considering the relative merits of the\nmodels we addressed not only technical\nconcerns but also the cultural issues\ndiscussed earlier, and especially how e-print\nprovision (by authors) can be achieved,\nsince without this content provision there\ncan be no effective e-print delivery service\n(for users). The points for and against each\nof the candidate models are summarized in\nTable 2.\nFigure 1 The centralized model.\nFigure 2 The distributed model.\neach of these\nmodels had\narguments for\nand against it\nDeveloping a model for e-prints and open access journal content in UK further and higher education 35\nL E A R N E D P U B L I S H I N G V O L . 1 8 N O . 1 J A N U A R Y 2 0 0 5\nThe model we recommended\nFor technical and cultural reasons, the study\nrecommended that the centralized model\nshould not be adopted for the proposed UK\nservice. First, this would have been the\ncostliest option. Second, it would have\nomitted the growing body of content in\ndistributed institutional, subject-based and\nopen access journal archives. Third, the\ncentral archiving approach is the \u2018wrong way\nround\u2019 with respect to e-print provision (see\nbelow) and would therefore not provide so\neffective a route to a critical mass of e-print\nmaterial as the other models.\nThe distributed model had some distinct\nadvantages over the centralized model in\nrespect of the points above, but oper-\nationally it did not allow the kind of quality\nof service that we believed was possible to\nattain. In particular, the consistency and\nquality of metadata was out of the control of\nthe agency that would run the new service,\nyet the quality of metadata is profoundly\nimportant to the overall usefulness and\neffectiveness of such a service. This model,\nwe felt, was adequate but not optimal.\nIt was clear to us that the harvesting\nmodel had the greatest promise. Not only is\nit compatible with the technical require-\nments and capabilities we had identified,\nand provides the means to standardize,\nimprove and enhance the metadata and,\nhence, service level, but it also provides the\nmost effective means of overcoming one of\nthe major \u2018cultural\u2019 obstacles, which is the\nprovision of e-print content in the first place.\nOne of the critical aspects of our decision\nwas that any model for delivering e-prints\nmust operate in, and help to create, the\narena most likely to generate the maximum\namount of e-print content-provision by\nauthors. Since this issue is so important, it is\nworth developing the argument further here.\nTwo things have a bearing on the level of\nauthor self-archiving \u2013 archives being avail-\nable for authors to use and authors actually\narchiving their articles. From the evidence\nwe looked at \u2013 existing archives \u2013 it was\nclear to us that even when archives are\navailable there is still precious little peer-\nreviewed material yet being deposited, so it\nis author behaviour that is at the very root\nof this matter. How may authors be \u2018encour-\naged\u2019 to self-archive? The evidence shows\nthat while the carrot of increased visibility\nand impact does prompt a proportion of\nauthors to archive their work, \u2018encourage-\nment\u2019 would best also take the form of a\nstick by self-archiving being made mandatory\nas a condition of funding or employment.\nThere are few examples of such mandates\nin operation as yet (though where they exist,\nthey are working25), but plenty of promise\nfor those to come. A recent study on open\naccess publishing produced clear evidence\nthat authors have, in general and in prin-\nciple, no objection to self-archiving and will\ncomply with a mandate to do so from their\nemployer or research funder: in total 77% of\nauthors would comply with such a mandate\n(69% would do so willingly), while only 3%\nsaid they would not comply.30,31\nFigure 3 The harvesting model.\nit was clear to\nus that the\nharvesting\nmodel had the\ngreatest promise\n36 A.

Scholars\nwill self-archive if told to do so. Employers\nand research funders have the authority to\ndo the telling, but tell authors to do what,\nand which authors? Funders can only tell\ntheir grant-holders, but they do have the\nchoice of telling them to deposit their\narticles in the funder\u2019s own archive (if there\nis one), in some other centralized archive, or\nin the researcher\u2019s own institutional archive,\nor all of these.\nEmployers can do all these too, but since\nthey not only have shared goals with their\nresearchers in respect of dissemination of\nresearch findings, but also see additional\nvalue in, and uses for, the content of an\ninstitutional archive, they are very likely to\nbe eager to see it maximally populated and\nwill insist on authors depositing there, at the\nvery least. Moreover, they can mandate and\nmonitor self-archiving across the board,\nincluding by researchers who are not sup-\nported by external funding (a large number\nin many subject areas), and in every scholarly\ndiscipline. This is far more effective a route\nto comprehensive e-print provision than\nrelying on funder mandates alone, and is\nmuch more likely to provide e-prints in all\ndisciplines relatively quickly than relying on\nthe eventual establishment of centralized\narchives in all subject areas. A two-pronged\nattack from funders and employers (univer-\nsities and research institutions) mandating\nself-archiving in institutional archives is the\noptimal way forward.\nFinally, many publishers have formally\nendorsed the practice of authors of articles\npublished in their journals self-archiving\nthem locally in institutional archives or\ndepartmental or personal websites, but will\nnot permit them to self-archive in \u2018third\nparty\u2019 archives. A centralized model for the\nnew service would presumably be viewed as\nbelonging in the \u2018third party\u2019 category and\nwould therefore suffer from publisher pro-\nhibition policies.\nOur conclusion was, then, that this\nscenario is the one most likely to provide the\nmaximum level of self-archived content, a\nmajor plank of any model for the provision\nof e-prints nationwide in the UK.\nImplementation of the harvesting model\nand services based upon it\nHarvesting methods\nThere are several fundamental ways in\nwhich metadata might be harvested from\nOAI-compliant archives:\n1. Harvesting from institutional archives,\nsubject-based archives and open access\njournals is carried out at a national,\ncentral level. Then subject-based and\nother service providers harvest or cross-\nsearch subsets from the central national\nservice\n2. Harvesting within subject disciplines is\ncarried out by subject-based service pro-\nviders. These then act as data providers\nto national services.\n3. Harvesting by resource types \u2013 e-prints\/\nOAJs, e-theses, reports literature \u2013 is\ncarried out by agencies dedicated to those\ntypes. These agencies act as data pro-\nviders to national services\nThe first option is the most realistic and\nworkable at this time, though the second\nand third options do have some advantages,\nnot least the modular management of\nservices. Neither the subject portals required\nfor option 2 nor the hypothetical agencies\nrequired for option 3 are in place, however,\nso at this time harvesting at national level\n(option 1) offers the best route to consist-\nency and avoidance of duplication of effort.\nIn fact, option 1 already exists in prototype\nin the Eprints UK project.32\nAlternative services based upon the\nbroad-level harvesting model (option 1\nabove)\nWe see three basic ways in which the\nharvesting model might be used as a basis for\ne-print and open access journal content\nservice provision in the UK.\nmandating\nself-archiving\nin institutional\narchives is the\noptimal way\nforward\n38 A. Swan et al.\nL E A R N E D P U B L I S H I N G V O L . 1 8 N O . 1 J A N U A R Y 2 0 0 5\nAn ePrints UK-type service\nePrints UK, one prototype, harvests meta-\ndata from e-print archives and enhances\nthem through web services. Data providers\n(the universities and other research institu-\ntions) can then re-harvest their enhanced\nrecords to improve their own local services.\nMeanwhile, ePrints UK provides access to\nthe whole dataset via its own interface.33\nA portal-in-a-browser service\nOur view is that this model is simple,\nelegant and in keeping with the JISC\nInformation Environment architecture. It\nhas been adopted by the European Library\nproject.34 This model differs from the ePrints\nUK model in that we have stripped out the\nweb services (though these may be added in\nagain at a future date when they have\nmatured) and added a central archive that\n\u2018mops up\u2019 articles deposited by authors who\ndo not have an institutional archive to use.\nThe model is shown in Figure 4. All the\nprotocols used in this model are standard\nprotocols, which are straightforward and\ninexpensive to implement.\nThe Google service model\nThe use of Google to search university\narchives using DSpace via a search system\nset up by OCLC is now being piloted.35 If\ntrials prove successful, and if the pilot can be\nextended to search archives powered by\nsoftware other than just DSpace, this may\nprovide a complementary strand to the other\ntwo models.\nWhichever of these detailed service\nmodels is ultimately adopted for a national\nUK open access service, it is clear that the\nparent-level harvesting model is the one\nwhich should form the basis of a UK service.\nIts advantages heavily outweigh its dis-\nadvantages, and overall it presents a superior\noption to the centralized and distributed\nmodels that form the alternatives. The\nOpen Archives Initiative employs a philos-\nophy whose time has come, and the harvesting\nmodel has gained worldwide acceptance. It\nmakes it easy to share information about\nscholarly resources and to offer enhanced\nresource discovery tools, and its use is\nbecoming widespread elsewhere. In view of\nthis, we recommended that the harvesting\nmodel should form the basis of open access\nservice provision in the United Kingdom.\nReferences\n1.
