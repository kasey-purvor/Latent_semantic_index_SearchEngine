Linear polarization measurements have been combined with angular correlations of\ncoincident g rays to determine the electromagnetic character of numerous transitions. The impact of the results\non shell-model parametrizations is briefly discussed.\nDOI: 10.1103\/PhysRevC.69.037303 PACS number(s): 27.50.1e, 21.60.Cs, 23.20.En, 23.20.Lv\nDoubly magic nuclei and their nearby neighbors are of\nspecific interest in nuclear structure studies because they are\nthe prominent testing ground for the spherical shell model\nand its parametrizations. Recent high-spin g-ray spectro-\nscopic studies of nuclei just above 56Ni, e.g., Refs. [1\u20134],\nhave shown that despite the fact that they are lying in the\nheart of the fp shell the l=4, 1g9\/2 intruder orbital is impor-\ntant for the understanding of moderately excited levels or\nsometimes even low-spin states in these nuclei. This mani-\nfests in difficulties of modern large-scale shell-model theory\nin describing these nuclei, because a proper model space and\ninteraction comprising both the fp shell and the 1g9\/2 orbital\ncannot readily be derived [5]. Important experimental input\nconcerning this problem is the unambiguous identification of\nparity changing transitions, as each change in parity is asso-\nciated with the excitation of a particle from the fp shell into\nthe 1g9\/2 orbital. The present experimental study aims at such\nkey transitions by a survey of angular correlation and linear\npolarization measurements in neutron-deficient mass A,60\nnuclei.\nThe experiment was performed at the Laboratori Nazi-\nonali di Legnaro in Italy using a 96 MeV 24Mg beam, which\nwas provided by the Tandem XTU accelerator, and a\n0.5 mg\/cm2 thin 40Ca target. The 40Ca layer was backed by\n7 mg\/cm2 gold and on the front it was protected against\noxidation with a flash of gold. The g radiation following the\nfusion-evaporation reaction was detected in the EUROBALL\nGe-detector array [6] consisting of 26 CLOVER detectors [7]\n(13 at 77\u00b0 and 13 at 103\u00b0 relative to the beam axis) and 15\nCLUSTER detectors [8] (5 at 103\u00b0, 5 at 135\u00b0, and 5 at 156\u00b0).\nThe 1p forward section of EUROBALL was covered with\nthe 50 liquid scintillator elements of the EUROBALL Neu-\ntron Wall [9] to measure evaporated neutrons, while evapo-\nrated charged particles were detected in the 40-element sili-\ncon DE-E array ISIS [10].\nDirectional correlations between oriented states (DCO)\nhave been investigated with g rays detected in the\nCLUSTER ring at Q=156\u00b0 and the CLOVER section (Q\n=77\u00b0 and Q=103\u00b0) by means of DCO ratios [11]\nRDCO =\nIsg1 at 156\u00b0; gated with g2 at 77\u00b0,103\u00b0d\nIsg1 at 77\u00b0,103\u00b0; gated with g2 at 156\u00b0d\n. s1d\nNote that the CLOVER detectors at 77\u00b0 and 103\u00b0 are\nequivalent as far as DCO ratios are concerned. The num-\nbers presented in Table I involve a correction for detection\nefficiencies, which has been applied to both the gated and\nprojected g rays. Line shapes from Doppler shift attenua-\ntion effects may occur for transitions from short-lived\nstates due to g-ray emission during the slowing down pro-\ncess of the recoils in the gold backing. If the lifetime is\nnot too short, i.e., if a major fraction of the line shape\ncomes from g-ray emission from stopped recoils, the ef-\nfect can easily be accounted for by performing an integra-\ntion to determine the full yield of a transition in a spec-\ntrum, instead of the conventional least-squares fit to a\nsharp Gaussian peak shape. Known stretched E2 transi-\ntions were used for gating, such that RDCO=1.0 is expected\nfor stretched quadrupole transitions and RDCO,0.6 for\nstretched dipoles, while nonstretched DI=0 transitions\nhave values similar to stretched quadrupole transitions.\nThe linear polarization and, consequently, the electric or\nmagnetic character of the radiation can typically (see, e.g.,\nRef. [12]) be determined through a normalized difference\nbetween the number of Compton scattered g rays in the re-\naction plane Ni, and perpendicular to it, N\u2019. They are mea-\nsured in either dedicated Compton polarimeters (see, e.g.,\n*Present address: Institute of Nuclear Research, H-4001 Debre-\ncen, Hungary.\n\u2020Present address: Department of Physics, University of Guelph,\nGuelph, Ontario, Canada N1G 2W1.\n\u2021Present address: School of Chemistry and Physics, Keele Univer-\nsity, Keele, Staffordshire, ST5 5BG, UK.\n\u00a7Present address: Dipartmento di Fisica dell\u2019Universit\u00e1 and INFN,\nSezione di Padova, I-35141 Padova, Italy.\nPHYSICAL REVIEW C 69, 037303 (2004)\n0556-2813\/2004\/69(3)\/037303(4)\/$22.50 \u00a92004 The American Physical Society69 037303-1\nRef.

The analysis with respect to angular correla-\ntions and especially linear polarization requires both statis-\ntics and unequivocally clean peaks in the g-ray spectra. The\nformer requires that the relative cross section of the residues\nhas to be at least a few percent of the total fusion-\nevaporation cross section, whereas the latter is achieved by\nperforming the analysis in gg mode and eventually demand-\ning a coincidence with an evaporated neutron. Thus four gg\nmatrices were created off line for the analysis: in-plane and\nout-of-plane Compton scattered g-ray events in the\nCLOVER section vs g rays detected anywhere in\nEUROBALL, both without any particle coincidence restric-\ntion and with coincidence of at least one detected neutron.\nAs many as possible clean coincidence spectra of the\nCompton scattered g rays were created by gating on intense\nknown peaks of several residual nuclei in these matrices,\nkeeping the gating conditions for the in-plane and out-of-\nplane projections identical. To deduce the linear polarization\nof a given transition in a given isotope a certain subset of\ncoincidence spectra was summed to increase the statistics.\nOne example is illustrated in Fig. 1, which shows the\nsummed spectra in coincidence with the 1038 and 1361 keV\ntransitions in 61Cu: While the anisotropies for the 988, 1038,\nand 1065 keV peaks are clear and positive, the anisotropy for\nthe 970 keV line is close to zero and the one for the 736 keV\nline negative. In conjunction with the DCO ratios the multi-\npolarities shown in Fig. 1 can be assigned easily (cf. Table I).\nFigure 2 shows the clean separation of different types of\nFIG. 1. Linear polarization spectra of in-plane (black) and out-\nof-plane (gray) scattered g rays in coincidence with the 1038 and\n1361 keV transitions in 61Cu without any particle gating restriction.\nTransitions are labeled with their energies in keV and assigned mul-\ntipolarity.

(1) and (2). There is\nonly one ambiguity between stretched electric quadrupole\nradiation and DI=0 E2\/M1 radiation, which have both simi-\nlar DCO ratios and anisotropies. However, such ambiguitites\ncan be accounted for by means of yrast arguments\u2014in high-\nspin studies the stretched transitions are usually much more\nintense than the non-stretched transitions\u2014and information\nfrom parallel branches, which provide additional information\non the relevant states.\nTable I provides a short summary of the present study. A\nmore comprehensive table can be found in Ref. [14]. The\nuncertainties in Table I are derived from standard error\npropagation formulas and include the uncertainties in the\npeak areas and of the efficiency corrections (DCO ratios) or\nthe normalization function (anisotropies), respectively. Note\nthat by calculating a difference in the numerator of Eq. (1),\nlarge (relative) uncertainties may occur for the anisotropy\nresults.\nBesides a number of reference transitions in mainly 61Cu\n[15,2], Table I comprises the ,25 unambiguous parity-\nchanging E1 transitions identified in 61Zn, 60\u201361Cu, 57\u201360Ni,\nand 57Co [2,15\u201321] as well as a large fraction of until now\nambiguous or unknown transitions in 61Zn [15,2] and 60Cu\n[16,17]. For completeness, the relevant parts of the excitation\nschemes of 61Zn and 60\u201361Cu are included in Fig. 3. They\ncomprise about half the information from the present experi-\nment and are subject to further detailed nuclear structure\nstudies. Figure 4 presents an example of the quality of the\nfull gg data by means of a spectrum in coincidence with the\nnew 446 keV 11\u2212\u219210\u2212 transition in 60Cu.\nWhile the level schemes of the two copper isotopes are by\nand large in agreement with the most recent high-spin inves-\ntigations [2,17], the decay scheme of 61Zn is by far more\ncomprehensive and complete compared to previous investi-\ngations. It comprises what one may interpret as signature\npartner bands for both negative and positive parity up to the\nmaximally aligned seniority five states at I=19\/2\u2212 and\n25\/2+. Furthermore, the excitation of one or two particles\nfrom the fp shell into the 1g9\/2 orbital are clearly marked by\nthe 1403 keV 9\/2+\u21927\/2\u2212 and 1538 keV 23\/2\u2212\u219221\/2+\ntransitions, respectively.\nIn summary, reliable experimental information concerning\nparity-changing E1 transitions has been presented, which is\nconsidered an important contribution to the determination of\na shell-model configuration space including both the fp shell\nand the 1g9\/2 orbital. The position of 9 \/2+ states, presumably\nof single-particle character, has been supported or marked in\nthe odd-A isotopes 57,59Ni, 61Cu, and 61Zn.\nThe authors thank S. Kasemann and R.
