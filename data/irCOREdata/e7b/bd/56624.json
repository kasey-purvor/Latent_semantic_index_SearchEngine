The new data extend between 55\u00b0 45\u2032S and 24 \n57\u00b0 20\u2032S and include Protector Shoal and the areas around Zavodovski, Visokoi and 25 \nthe Candlemas islands groups. Each of these areas is a discrete volcanic center. The 26 \nentirely submarine Protector Shoal area, close to the northern limit of the arc, forms a 27 \n55 km long east-west-trending seamount chain that is at least partly of silicic 28 \ncomposition. The seamounts are comparable to small subaerial stratovolcanoes in 29 \nsize, with volumes up to 83 km3, indicating that they are the product of multiple 30 \neruptions over extended periods. Zavodovski, Visokoi and the Candlemas island 31 \ngroup are the summits of three 3-3.5 km high volcanic edifices. The bathymetric data 32 \nshow evidence for relationships between constructional volcanic features, including 33 \nmigrating volcanic centers, structurally controlled constructional ridges, satellite lava 34 \nflows and domes, and mass wasting of the edifices. Mass wasting takes place mainly 35 \nby strong erosion at sea level, and dispersal of this material along chutes, probably as 36 \nturbidity currents and other mass flows that deposit in extensive sediment wave fields. 37 \nLarge scale mass wasting structures include movement of unconsolidated debris in 38 \nslides, slumps and debris avalanches. Volcanism is migrating westward relative to the 39 \nunderlying plate and major volcanoes are asymmetrical, being steep with abundant 40 \nrecent volcanism on their western flanks, and gently sloping with extinct, eroded 41 \nvolcanic sequences to their east.

Introduction 50 \nRecent studies using multibeam seafloor mapping have added substantial knowledge 51 \nof the distributions, structures and evolutions of volcanic edifices in intra-oceanic arcs 52 \nsuch as the Lesser Antilles arc (Deplus et al., 2001; Le Friant et al., 2004), Izu-Bonin 53 \narc (Fiske et al., 2001; Tani et al., 2008), Tonga-Kermadec arc (Wright et al., 2006; 54 \nMassoth et al., 2007; Chadwick et al., 2008; Graham et al., 2008) and Mariana arc 55 \n(Oakley et al., 2009). These studies have revealed considerable variability in 56 \nsubmarine flank morphology of the volcanoes of intra-oceanic arcs, indicating that 57 \nthey are modified by a range of mass-wasting processes.  These range from debris 58 \navalanches generated during catastrophic sector collapse (Siebert, 1984; Siebert et al., 59 \n1987), to slumps of more coherent material on submarine slopes (Wright et al., 2006; 60 \nTani et al., 2008), slide scars generated by small-scale sliding (Chadwick et al., 2008; 61 \nChiocci et al., 2008a, 2008b), and flow of volcanigenic sediment away from subaerial 62 \nzones as turbidity currents. However, the variation in relative importance of these 63 \nprocesses in relation to volcano structure, composition, degree of emergence and 64 \nassociated factors such as rates of subaerial and coastal erosion is poorly known.  65 \n 66 \nThe intra-oceanic South Sandwich arc, situated in the South Atlantic, consists of large 67 \nsubmarine volcanic edifices whose summit form relatively small volcanic islands. 68 \nMany of the islands are glaciated, and all have high energy erosional coastlines. 69 \n 4 \nVolcaniclastic debris generation in the South Sandwich arc may be a maximum for an 70 \nintra-oceanic arc, and may be used to contrast arc volcanoes in low-energy ocean 71 \nenvironments such as the Bismarck arc (Silver et al., 2009) and Aeolian arc (Favalli et 72 \nal., 2005) . In this paper, we describe newly-acquired multibeam images and sub 73 \nbottom profile data of the sea floor around the intra-oceanic South Sandwich arc, and 74 \nuse the data to interpret how constructional and erosional processes interact in this 75 \nisland group.  76 \n 77 \n2. Geological framework of the South Sandwich arc 78 \nThe volcanically active South Sandwich arc is built on the small oceanic Sandwich 79 \nplate (Baker, 1990; Barker, 1995; Larter et al., 2003; Leat et al., 2003), and comprises 80 \nseven main subaerial volcanoes, from Zavodovski in the north to Southern Thule in 81 \nthe south, which form a convex volcanic front (Fig. 1). These subaerial volcanoes are 82 \nemergent summits of volcanic edifices that rise some 3 km from the Sandwich plate 83 \nbasement. In addition, there is one smaller rear-arc volcanic island (Leskov), and 84 \nlarge seamount groups at both ends of the arc (Protector Shoal in the north, and 85 \nNelson and Kemp seamounts in the south (Baker, 1990; Leat et al., 2004). The arc is 86 \nforming in response to steeply inclined subduction of the South American plate 87 \nbeneath the Sandwich plate at a rate of 67-79 mm y-1 (Thomas et al., 2003). To the 88 \nnorth, the South American plate is tearing in order to subduct, generating a major 89 \nzone of seismicity (Forsyth, 1975). The associated trench, some 7 km deep, has no 90 \nsignificant accretionary complex with virtually all sediment arriving at the trench 91 \nbeing subducted (Vanneste and Larter, 2002).   92 \n 93 \n 5 \nThe arc is built on ocean crust formed to the west at the currently active East Scotia 94 \nRidge back-arc spreading center (Livermore et al., 1997; Fretzdorff et al., 2002; 95 \nLivermore, 2003). Magnetic data suggest that the crest of the arc overlies ocean crust 96 \nof anomaly 5 (9.7-10.9 Ma) in the center of the arc (Larter et al., 2003). To the west 97 \nof the spreading center, magnetic lineaments can be traced back to anomaly 5B (15.0 98 \nMa). These relationships have been used to suggest that fore-arc has been removed by 99 \nsubduction erosion at a rate of 5.3 km Ma-1 over the last 15 Ma (Vanneste and Larter, 100 \n2002; Larter et al., 2003).   101 \n 102 \n2.1. Previous bathymetric and geophysical investigations 103 \nSeismic data demonstrate the simple crustal structure of the southern South Sandwich 104 \narc and fore-arc (Larter et al., 1998, 2003; Vanneste et al., 2002). Smellie et al. (1998) 105 \ndescribed single beam bathymetric data revealing a ~4.5 km diameter, ~630 m deep 106 \ncaldera between Thule and Cook islands in Southern Thule. This caldera was re-107 \nsurveyed using multibeam bathymetry in 2006 (Allen and Smellie, 2008).  The back-108 \narc East Scotia Ridge and part of the northern fore-arc were mapped in 1995 using 109 \ntowed Hawaii MR1 sonar (Fig. 1b) (Livermore et al., 1997; Vanneste and Larter, 110 \n2002; Livermore, 2003). 111 \n 112 \n2.2. South Sandwich Island volcanism and erosion processes 113 \nThe subaerial parts of the South Sandwich arc volcanoes are relatively well known, 114 \nfollowing surveys in 1964 (Holdgate and Baker, 1979; Tomblin, 1979) and 1997 115 \n(Smellie et al., 1998; Leat et al., 2003).  The islands are dominantly basaltic, with 116 \ndacites and andesites being locally important, and the islands belonging to low-K 117 \ntholeiitic, tholeiitic, and calc-alkaline magmatic lineages (Pearce et al., 1995, Leat et 118 \n 6 \nal., 2003, 2004)  Most volcanoes show evidence of recent activity, notably the well-119 \ndocumented eruptions on Bristol Island (1956), Protector Shoal (1962), Saunders 120 \nIsland (1995-1998) and Montagu Island (2001-2004) (Gass et al., 1963; Baker, 1990; 121 \nLachlan-Cope et al., 2001; Leat et al., 2003; Patrick et al., 2005).  122 \n 123 \nOnshore investigations show the islands are undergoing very rapid erosion, 124 \ndominantly coastal. Most of the volcano coastlines are vertical cliffs up to about 350 125 \nm in height that are subjected to year-round pounding by Southern Ocean swell. The 126 \nislands consist of easily eroded sequences of lava, scoria, and ash deposits (Holdgate 127 \nand Baker, 1979; Baker, 1990; Smellie et al., 1998). Most islands have rugged 128 \ntopography, and several rise to over 400 m high (the highest is 1372 m), despite 129 \ntypically being less than 6 km across. They are devoid of stabilising vegetation, the 130 \nlargest masses of vegetation consisting of moss banks around fumaroles (Longton and 131 \nHoldgate, 1979; Convey et al., 2000). Most islands, and all of the larger ones, are 132 \nglaciated, with the glaciers directly entering the sea at ice cliffs. Permanent streams 133 \nare absent. Where beaches occur, they are extremely high-energy environments, and 134 \ncharacterised by large, highly rounded boulders. Significant flat areas occur only on 135 \nCandlemas Island, where a central area protected by volcanic sequences to either side 136 \nand connecting boulder beaches has generated a 2x1 km area of trapped sediment 137 \n(Tomblin, 1979; Leat et al., 2003). These factors suggest that physical erosion rates of 138 \nthe South Sandwich Islands may be maxima for intra-oceanic arcs, with consequently 139 \nhigh rates of transport of volcaniclastic sediment down volcano flanks.  140 \n 141 \n3. Methodology 142 \n 7 \nMultibeam data were acquired during in April and May 2007, using a hull-mounted 143 \nSimrad EM 120 multibeam bathymetric sonar aboard the British research ship RRS 144 \nJames Clark Ross (BAS Cruise ID JR168, NERC Cruise leg JR20070418) (Tate and 145 \nLeat, 2007). The system has a 12 kHz operating frequency and a 191 beam array with 146 \nreal-time beam steering and active pitch and roll compensation. Data were acquired 147 \nusing Simrad's Merlin software and were processed manually using MB System 148 \nv5.0.9 software. Cleaned data were gridded at 100 m resolution and data were also 149 \ndisplayed as a Triangulated Irregular Network to show full resolution surfaces. 150 \nVertical measurement accuracy (Simrad specifications) is in the order of 50 cm or 151 \n0.2% of depth root mean square (RMS) (whichever is greater). Horizontal resolution 152 \nvaried according to ship speed, water depth, beam angle, track overlap and bottom 153 \ntopography, but is typically 10-20 m at 1000 m and 50-100 m at over 3000 m.  154 \n 155 \nSub-bottom data were collected using a hull-mounted Simrad TOPAS PS 018 profiler 156 \non RRS James Clark Ross during (BAS Cruise ID JR206, NERC Cruise leg 157 \nJR20100118) in January and February 2010. Three lines were run over Seamount PS4 158 \nwith a combined length of 76.6 km and four separate TOPAS sub-bottom profiler 159 \nlines with a combined length of 103 km were acquired east of Zavodoski Island. All 160 \nruns were made using chirp mode on 90% power with a pulse length of 15 ms and 161 \nstart and stop frequencies of 1.5 and 5.0 kHz respectively. Vessel speed varied 162 \nbetween 6 and 11 knots, and ping interval was 1500 or 2000 ms, except for line 163 \nJR206_a (5000 ms). Interpretation of TOPAS data in this area is complicated by 164 \nlimited sediment penetration, and determining whether the lower limit of surficial 165 \nsediments is a result of signal dissipation or a real boundary between two sediment 166 \nunits is difficult.  In the absence of clear lower reflectors, or a sharp change in 167 \n 8 \nreflectivity characteristics, we interpret imaged lower boundaries of the surficial units 168 \nas due to signal dissipation. 169 \n  170 \nThe new bathymetric data are shown in Fig. 2A, and Fig. 2B shows derived slopes. 171 \nThe data show for the first time that the submerged parts of Zavodovski, Vioskoi and 172 \nCandlemas form three distinct edifices. There are no imaged satellite seamounts 173 \nbetween these large volcanoes, although small volcanoes occur on the lower flanks of 174 \nthe volcanoes as discussed below. The submarine slopes of the volcanoes are defined 175 \nby ridges separating wide embayments, narrow chutes descending from shallow 176 \nshelves and interpreted foci of sediment transport, and steep-sided canyons, 177 \noccupying lower slopes. The Protector Shoal area in the north is different, consisting 178 \nof a roughly east-west group of seamounts.  179 \n 180 \n4. South Sandwich arc (55\u00b045' - 57\u00b020')  181 \n4.1. Protector Shoal 182 \nThe entirely submarine Protector Shoal area lies close to the northern limit of the arc. 183 \nIt is thought to have been the source of the eruption which produced an extensive 184 \npumice raft that was encountered in the vicinity of Zavodovski Island in March 1962 185 \n(Gass et al., 1963), and which subsequently dispersed around Antarctica on the 186 \nAntarctic Circumpolar Current (Risso et al., 2002). Based on the dimensions of the 187 \npumice raft, the volume of pumice produced by this eruption is interpreted to have 188 \nbeen at least 0.6 km3 (Gass et al., 1963). Geochemically, the 1962 pumice is low-K 189 \ntholeiitic andesite, dacite and (dominantly) rhyolite. Dredge DR.162, recovered 190 \nduring RRS James Clark Ross cruise JR18 in 1997 (Leat et al., 2007), from what was 191 \nthen thought to be the southern slope of Protector Shoal, recovered exclusively 192 \n 9 \ntholeiitic rhyolite samples which form three distinct compositional groups, that are all 193 \ndifferent from the 1962 eruption rhyolite. The presence of four distinct silicic magma 194 \ngroups in the pumice and dredged samples led Leat et al. (2007) to propose that the 195 \ndifferent magmas represented partial melts of distinct mafic sources in the arc crust. 196 \n  197 \nThe new bathymetric data (Fig. 3) confirm that the Protector Shoal area is a distinct 198 \neast-west-trending seamount chain, rather than a single edifice. The chain is some 55 199 \nkm long, and consists of seven main seamounts, herein called seamounts PS1-PS7, 200 \nthat coalesce to form an underlying east-west trending ridge. None of these edifices 201 \ncorresponds exactly to the location of Protector Shoal as shown on the Admiralty 202 \nchart (Hydrographic Office, 1989), which shows a 27 m deep summit some 7 km 203 \nsouthwest of PS4.  PS4 is the closest to Protector Shoal marked on the chart, as well 204 \nas being the shallowest edifice in the seamount chain, at 55 m deep, and we suggest 205 \nthat PS4 should be recognised as Protector Shoal. 206 \n 207 \nTo the north of the seamounts, a distinct faulted terrain is imaged, consisting of north 208 \neast-southwest-trending faults that downthrow consistently to the southeast and form 209 \nscarps up to 50 m high (Fig. 3). The faults are interpreted to be related to the flexure 210 \nof the north edge of the Sandwich plate adjacent to the trench.  211 \n 212 \nMorphological characteristics of the seamounts are summarized in Table 1. They are 213 \ngenerally conical and have dome-like summits and smooth flanks. Flank slopes are 214 \ntypically 2-14\u00ba, although locally steeper. The seamounts rise some 400-1400 m above 215 \ntheir surroundings, and the shallowest (PS4) is only 55 m below sea level. They are 216 \nclearly constructional volcanic forms. Only seamount PS4 has been sampled (Fig. 3) 217 \n 10 \non its southern flank west of the prominent scar-like structure. Compositions of the 218 \nother seamounts are unknown, but we suggest that they are also likely to be silicic 219 \nsince they are morphologically similar to PS4. The basal diameters chosen (Table 1) 220 \nare the isobaths where the seamounts become distinct features, and are probable 221 \nminima, as they ignore the volume of the underlying ridge-like structure where 222 \nseamounts coalesce. Calculated volumes range between 4 km3 for the minor PS3 223 \nstructure and 55 km3 and 83 km3 for PS5 and PS6, respectively. These larger volumes 224 \nare greater than those of monogenetic rhyolite domes suggesting that the seamounts 225 \nare composite stratovolcanoes.  226 \n 227 \nThe three eastern seamounts PS1, PS2 and PS3 have smooth surfaces with no obvious 228 \nrecently formed features, and are interpreted to be older.    229 \n 230 \nSeamount PS4 has two large flank scars with surface undulations within the scars. 231 \nThe best-preserved scar (Fig. 4A) extends from a south-facing bowl about 2.5 km in 232 \nwidth at the summit to the southern base of the seamount. Within the feature, there are 233 \na series of well-defined steps, each of which extends across its whole width. The steps 234 \nare mostly 1.5-2.0 km from front to back and approximately 100-340 m high, and are 235 \nconfined within inward facing lateral margins. The overall slope is ca. 6\u00b0 in the upper 236 \nsection, reducing to 4\u00b0 or less on the lower slope. The upper steps slope backward, 237 \nwith well-defined hollows on each step, whereas lower steps become less distinct 238 \ndown-slope. This topography extends for a distance of about 19 km to beyond the 239 \nbase of the seamount, below 2000 m, where it widens to about 10 km. The terrain 240 \ncovers an area of at least 150 km2. The feature is interpreted as a slump because of its 241 \n 11 \nclearly defined source within the south-facing bowl, its well-defined inward facing 242 \nlateral margins and back-rotated steps. 243 \n 244 \nThe down-slope TOPAS line JR206_24 (Fig. 5B) also shows the down-slope 245 \ngradation, with larger, clearly back-sloping steps in its upper part, and lower relief 246 \nundulations with no clear evidence for back-rotation on the lower slope. The cross-247 \nslope TOPAS line JR206_25 (Fig. 5C) images the 190 m high, inward-facing margins 248 \nof the slump and its undulating surface, which contrasts to the regular slopes either 249 \nside of the deposit.  250 \n 251 \nThe second scar on the northwest slope of seamount PS4 is smaller, some 4 km in 252 \nwidth, and less well-defined. It has similar ca. 100 m high, 0.9 to 1.4 km wide step-253 \nlike features, imaged by TOPAS (Fig. 5A), to those in the scar on the south flank. The 254 \nsteps slope backward, with well-defined hollows observed on some steps. This feature 255 \nalso is interpreted as a slump. Its inward-facing margins are indistinct, and a channel 256 \nis interpreted to cut through its lower northern margin forming the low topography 257 \nnorth of the slump blocks that is visible in the TOPAS image (Fig. 5A).  258 \n 259 \nSeamount PS5 locally has a bumpy surface, with variable slopes, particularly to the 260 \nsouth of the summit (Fig. 3). This may indicate recent lava eruptions. There are 261 \nseveral small dome-shaped features notably to the south of the seamount. These are 262 \ngenerally some 1-2 km in basal diameter, with heights between 150 and 280 m, giving 263 \nvolumes of about 0.1 to 0.3 km3, and are probably minor monogenetic satellite lava 264 \ndomes.  265 \n 266 \n 12 \nSeamount PS6 has the largest calculated volume of 83 km3 (Table 1). Like PS5, it has 267 \na bumpy summit area, probably representing recent lava eruptions, and has a distinct 268 \nscar on its southwest flank. The latter is about 1.8 km wide, narrower than those on 269 \nPS4,  is straight, and about 13 km long. The upper, steep part of the scar is smooth 270 \nand featureless, but the lower part is characterized by five step-like features. These are 271 \nabout 1.3 km apart and 100-200 m high, some forming hollows between steps.  272 \n 273 \nSeamount PS7 is ca. 646 m high, appears to surmount a ridge that trends northwest 274 \nfrom PS6, and is surmounted by a nested crater complex (Fig. 4B). A 3 km diameter x 275 \n140 m deep caldera is cut by a second caldera that is 1.6 km across and 200 m deep. 276 \nThis caldera is clearly breached to the southwest.  277 \n 278 \n4.2. Zavodovski 279 \nThe new data show that Zavodovski is a locally extensively dissected central volcano 280 \nthat is some 54 km across above the 1800 m isobath (Fig. 6), and the largest volcano 281 \nin the northern part of the South Sandwich arc. The volcano comprises an eastern and 282 \na western ridge, which, although they merge, are interpreted as distinct structures due 283 \nto differences in morphology as discussed below. The island is situated on the western 284 \nridge. None of the submarine features of Zavodovski volcano have been named 285 \npreviously and we use the informal names ZE1-3 and ZW1-6 for constructs on the 286 \neastern and western ridges, respectively.  287 \n 288 \n4.2.1 Subaerial edifice, shallow shelf and Mount Curry collapse 289 \nZavodovski Island (Fig. 7A) is about 5 km across and is dominated by a single 290 \nvolcanic cone, Mount Curry (551 m) (Holdgate and Baker, 1979; Baker, 1990). The 291 \n 13 \nisland has a permanent snowfield, but no significant glaciers. The cone consists of 292 \nscoria and ash and has a recently active central crater and a second crater to the north 293 \nwhich is filled, apparently by material ejected from the active crater (Fig. 7B). 294 \nAvailable analyses (Pearce et al., 1995; Leat et al., 2003) indicate that the subaerial 295 \nproducts of Zavodovski Island are entirely basalt and basaltic andesite. The active 296 \ncrater and western flanks of Mount Curry are vigorously fumarolically active, a 297 \nfeature of the island noted since the first landings were made during Bellingshausen\u2019s 298 \nexpedition in 1819 (Barr, 2000). 299 \n 300 \nZavodovski Island is surrounded by a shallow shelf to its north, east and south, which 301 \nis relatively flat and featureless, and mostly between 160 m and 70 m below sea level. 302 \nThe shelf is widest to the southeast of the island, where it is 6 km wide. The shelf 303 \nappears to continue at about the same depth on the summits of ZE1, ZE2 and ZE3. 304 \n 305 \nThere is southwest-facing embayment in ca. 100 m high coastal cliffs, exposing sub-306 \nhorizontal lavas overlain by scoria and ash deposits apparently interbedded with ice 307 \nlayers (Fig. 7A).  We interpret this structure as the head wall of a collapse structure 308 \nthat translated material to the west, herein called the Mount Curry collapse. The 309 \nsubaerial collapse scar is aligned with structures showing evidence for submarine 310 \ncollapse. The adjacent part of the shallow shelf is absent (Fig. 7C), the sea floor lying 311 \nabout 300-400 m below sea level just 2.7 km from the island. This area of lower 312 \ntopography is surrounded by 200 m high inward-facing slopes, forming an 313 \nembayment some 6.5 km across. The floor of the embayment is very irregular, with a 314 \n90 m high hummock in its center (H1 in Fig. 6). Hummock H1 may represent a large 315 \ntranslated block. To the west, the collapse feature appears to continue in the form of 316 \n 14 \ntwo sharply defined scars which extend from 500 to 1700 m depth. West of these 317 \nscars, indistinct hummocky topography occurs to the edge of the survey area, a 318 \ndistance up to 30 km from the island, which may be the associated debris avalanche 319 \ndeposit.  320 \n 321 \n4.2.2. Western ridge 322 \nZW1 is a rugged promontory standing some 200 m high and is 4 km across and may 323 \nrepresent an eroded, resistant volcanic center. ZW2 is a 12 km long ridge that extends 324 \nnorthwest from the main edifice and shows evidence of a possible landslip scar on its 325 \nnorthern flank. ZW2 is interpreted as a constructional volcanic feature, mirroring 326 \nfeature ZW5. Feature ZW3 is a ca. 4 km wide ridge that extends north from 327 \nZavodovski Island. At about the 400 m isobath east of ZW2, two subdued 328 \nembayments are tentatively interpreted as collapse headwalls.  329 \n 330 \nZW4 is a buttress directly south of Zavodovski Island that has a sub-horizontal 331 \nsurface at about 600 m depth, and is flanked to the east, west and south by slopes up 332 \nto 20\u00b0. The origin of ZW4 is uncertain, but it probably is a constructional feature. An 333 \nembayment east of ZW4 is interpreted as the head wall of a slump. The lower slopes 334 \nof the interpreted slump deposit are characterized by arcuate, roughly east-west 335 \ntrending steps with wavelengths of about 1.8 km, possibly masked by later deposits.  336 \nThe relatively gentle slopes at depths between 600 m and 1700 m around ZW5 are 337 \ncharacterized by indistinct backward-rotated steps or waves with wavelengths of 1.2-338 \n2.0 km, interpreted as slumps or small sediment wave fields. ZW5 is a cone-shaped 339 \nfeature interpreted as a volcanic dome or cone.  340 \n 341 \n 15 \nZW6 is a prominent northeast-southwest trending ridge that extends to Leskov Island. 342 \nThe ridge has steep (9-16\u00b0), regular slopes that show no apparent evidence of 343 \ncollapse. The feature rises to a flat top at about 640-570 m depth at 28\u00b0 50'W, 344 \nbuttressed by a conical form with 10-16\u00b0 slopes rising to 458 m depth to the 345 \nsouthwest. ZW6 is interpreted as a constructional volcanic feature forming a 346 \nnortheast-southwest-trending volcanic ridge joining Zavodovski and Leskov islands.  347 \n 348 \n4.2.3. Eastern ridge 349 \nContructs ZE1-3 form the eastern ridge of the volcano. ZE1 is a prominent flat-topped 350 \nbuttress. Its plateau is 4.4 km across from east to west and mostly 130-140 m below 351 \nsea level and appears to be smooth and featureless. The sides of ZE1 slope at mostly 352 \n5\u00ba-12\u00ba and have subdued ridges that mostly trend toward the east and northeast. 353 \nFeature ZE2 is an east-west trending ridge that rises to 140 m below sea level. The 354 \nsouth side of this ridge is particularly steep (up to 13\u00ba). Feature ZE3 is an 355 \napproximately circular, nearly flat-topped plateau at 180-120 m depth. There are a 356 \nseries of northeast-southwest trending ridges and troughs with amplitudes of up to 40 357 \nm on the plateau. Apart from the narrow 187 m depth ridge that joins it to the 358 \nZavodovski shallow shelf, the plateau is flanked by slopes of typically 10\u00b0.  359 \n 360 \nRegions to the northwest of ZE1 and between ZE1, ZE2 and ZE3 are occupied by 361 \nchutes that are approximately 5-7 km wide, with the most prominent being between 362 \nfeatures ZE2 and ZE3. This chute slopes at an average of about 2\u00ba to the east and has 363 \na prominent ca. 100 m high central ridge. The chutes have irregularly undulating 364 \nsurfaces consisting of many steps each about 70 m high which modify to 365 \nprogressively more regular wave-like structures with increasing distance from the 366 \n 16 \nvolcano (Fig. 7D). The step-like features also occur on the northern flank of feature 367 \nZE1 and locally on the southern flank of ZE3. The terrain is best developed on the 368 \nnorthern flank of ZE1, where the individual steps can be traced for ca. 4 km, and the 369 \nsteps are usually seen to pinch out laterally. The steps have regular dips within each 370 \nlocality.  371 \n 372 \nThe origin of features ZE1, ZE2 and ZE3 is uncertain, but similarities suggest a 373 \ncommon origin. The chutes that separate them appear to be erosional, dissecting 374 \nearlier structures. We interpret the features as remnants of an old, extinct part of 375 \nZavodovski volcano.   376 \n 377 \nA terrain with distinctive wave-like morphology lies east of Zavodovski volcano. 378 \n(Fig. 7D). This terrain is about 42 km long in an east-west direction, and extends to 379 \nthe eastern limit of the surveyed area (Fig. 6). It is 40 km in the north-south direction, 380 \ncovering an area of at least 1 200 km2. The underlying slope is about 2-3\u00b0. The terrain 381 \nis interpreted as a sediment wave field (Section 5.4.6). North of 56\u00ba 20'S, a distinct 382 \nfan has waves strongly parallel to contours and individually traceable over distances 383 \nup to 14 km. South of that latitude, another fan has waves that are narrower, more 384 \nsinuous, less parallel to contours and individually traceable up to 10 km. The two fans 385 \nare separated by a 3 km wide channel that trends east from the chute between ZE2 and 386 \nZE3, becomes indistinct below the 1500 m isobath (Fig. 7D), and terminates north of 387 \na 350 m high hill (H2, Fig. 6) which appears to be a plug-like feature. 388 \n 389 \nTOPAS sub-bottom imagery across the northern fan (line 27, Fig. 8) shows a gently 390 \nconcave slope with three groups of waves. A group occupying the upper part of the 391 \n 17 \nline is heterogeneous, and with wavelengths of about 1.5 km. A central group of large, 392 \nregular waves have generally flat tops, steep faces, wavelengths of 2.0-3.2 km and 393 \namplitudes of 53-149 m. The lower group is again heterogeneous, with wavelengths 394 \nof 1.0-3.1 km and amplitudes of 65-90 m. The southern fan (line 29, Fig. 8) is more 395 \nconcave with a similar progression of wave size down-slope, although at a generally 396 \nlower wavelength and amplitude (1.6-2.2 km and 50-105 m in the central section 397 \nrespectively). TOPAS data reveal that the central and lower groups have an upper unit 398 \nof stratified sediments of typically 20 ms two-way travel time (TWTT) thickness. 399 \nAssuming a sound velocity through sediments of 1650 m s-1 this equates to a 400 \nthickness of 16.5 m. This unit is locally observed to prograde down-slope from wave 401 \ncrests (Figs. 8A, D) and can be traced from crest to crest on the lower slopes (Figs. A, 402 \nC), indicating initial formation of the waves as sedimentary bedforms. Occasional 403 \ndeeper reflectors are observed within scarp slopes at depths of up to 30 ms TWTT, 404 \nequating to a distance of 24.8 m. Somewhat less frequently a deeper unit, 405 \ncharacterised by a sharp change in reflectivity, is observed away from the margins of 406 \nthe scarp slopes and below the upper stratified unit (Figs. 8A, D, E) this is interpreted 407 \nas the boundary between less consolidated upper sediments and more consolidated 408 \ndeeper sediments. We propose that the structures revealed by this boundary, between 409 \nless and more consolidated sediments, provide evidence of slumped material and 410 \nfaulting or fracturing of sediments. Mounds at the base of steeper slopes (Fig. 8B) and 411 \napparently tilted blocks (Fig. 8E) are further evidence for such deformation after 412 \ninitial deposition of the sediment waves.   413 \n 414 \nZavodovski volcano as a whole is asymmetrical, having significantly steeper slopes to 415 \nthe west than east. The western ridge is dominated by primary volcanic constructs, 416 \n 18 \nwhile the eastern ridge is consists of eroded volcanics and is heavily sedimented. 417 \nThese relationships are consistent with migration of volcanism to the west.  418 \n 419 \n4.3. Visokoi  420 \nVisokoi Island is approximately oval in shape, elongated in an E-W direction and 421 \nabout 8 km x 6 km in size (E-W and N-S respectively). It is formed by a single 422 \nstratovolcano that rises steeply from coastal cliffs to about 1005 m at the summit 423 \nforming Mount Hodson (Holdgate and Baker, 1979; Baker, 1990; Fig. 9A). Most of 424 \nthe island is currently glacier-covered. The summit is plateau-like, perhaps a crater 425 \nfilled by ice. Around the western sector of the island, the coast consists of high (up to 426 \n400-500 m) cliffs that expose successions of interbedded lavas and scoria (Fig. 9B). 427 \nThe eastern sector island cliffs are less than about 100 m high. There is a distinct 428 \nasymmetry to the island, with slopes to the east of the summit being about half those 429 \nto the west. A recent lava flow forms a terrace at sea level at the northern point of the 430 \nisland (Holdgate and Baker, 1979), but no unequivocal historical volcanic activity is 431 \nrecorded. According to existing data, volcanic compositions are restricted to basalt 432 \nand basaltic andesite (Pearce et al., 1995; Leat et al., 2003).      433 \n 434 \nMultibeam data show that Visokoi volcano is a well-defined edifice with dimensions 435 \nof 40 by 33 km above the 1800 m isobath in east-west and north-south directions 436 \nrespectively (Fig. 10). As with Zavodovski, the island is situated to the west of the 437 \nedifice center. A well-developed shelf, 2.3 to 6 km wide and shallower than 200 m, 438 \nsurrounds most of the island. The shelf appears to be absent from the southern coast, 439 \nwhere water depths reach 300 m within 2 km of the coast, and where the coastal cliffs 440 \nare notably high. There are no major satellite volcanoes to Visokoi.  441 \n 19 \n 442 \nMost of the submerged north, west and south slopes of Visokoi are steep (generally in 443 \nthe range 5-12\u00b0) and have a characteristic rugged topography producing a large 444 \nnumber of small topographic highs (Fig. 9C). These highs are up to 2 km across and 445 \nup to about 350 m above the surrounding slopes. Many have approximately conical 446 \nshapes, steep down-slope scarps (clearly seen on the slope plot, Fig. 2B). This 447 \ntopography occurs down to 2400 m water depth and up to 11 km from Visokoi Island, 448 \nespecially to the southwest. We interpret this topography as formed by eruption of 449 \ndomes or cones and effusion of lavas. Similar terrains have been imaged in submarine 450 \nvolcanic rift zones and on relatively stable submarine volcano flanks in Hawaii and 451 \nthe Canary Islands (Mitchell et al., 2002; Eakins and Robinson, 2006). The terrain is 452 \ncut by chutes west of the island and down-slope of the terrain there is a heterogeneous 453 \nterrain characterised by random distribution of hummocks up to about 100 m high, 454 \ninterpreted as debris that has slid down the chutes from the eruption sites (Fig. 10).   455 \n 456 \nThe east flank of Visokoi volcano is different. It forms a smooth, featureless plateau 457 \nthat is 15 km wide in an east-west direction and some 17 km across in a north-south 458 \ndirection (Fig. 10). The plateau slopes gently east from a depth of less than 200 m to 459 \nca. 600 m 12 km from the volcano. To the east the plateau passes into an area of deep 460 \ncanyons which may be a northward extension of a prominent structure which we 461 \ninformally name Ridge A. 462 \n  463 \nThe main segment of Ridge A is a curved, approximately NNW-SSE-trending 464 \npositive feature connecting the Visokoi and Candlemas edifices (Fig. 10). It is about 465 \n30 km long and rises some 600-1000 m above the surrounding topography. The 466 \n 20 \nsummit area of the ridge is gently undulating and rises toward both Visokoi and 467 \nCandlemas, with a central saddle at 980 m depth. Its western flank is relatively 468 \nfeatureless and has slopes of generally 3-8\u00b0. In contrast, its eastern flank is cut by 469 \nseveral main canyons, each with distinct headwalls and gullies that trend toward the 470 \nnortheast, and each separated from adjacent canyons by ridges 200-600 m high and up 471 \nto 20 km long. Canyon headwall and sidewall slopes are typically about 10\u00b0 and 472 \nlocally up to 24\u00b0. There are no obvious hummocky deposits on the floor of the 473 \ncanyons. They are interpreted as erosional forms generated by mass wasting to the 474 \nnortheast. Interestingly, all the canyons have floors around 1600-1800 m deep, 475 \nsuggesting that erosion is likely occurring down to a lithologically controlled level. 476 \n 477 \nVisokoi volcano as a whole, like Zavodovski, is asymmetrical, with young volcanism 478 \nforming steep slopes to the west, and eroded terrains to the east.    479 \n 480 \n4.4. Candlemas Group  481 \nThe two main islands of the group, Candlemas and Vindication islands are 4.5 km 482 \napart. The larger, 6 by 4 km Candlemas Island (Fig. 11A) consists of an older, lava-483 \ndominated series that forms the glacier-covered south of the island, and a recently-484 \nerupted group of lavas and scoria cones including the 232 m high Lucifer Hill that 485 \nform the north of the island (Holdgate and Baker, 1979, Tomblin, 1979; Leat et al., 486 \n2003). The older sequence rises to 550 m at Mount Andromeda (Fig. 11B). Dips of 487 \nbedding in the sequence are variable and do not match topography, indicating that the 488 \nsequence is strongly eroded. Local dips indicate the presence of several centers. For 489 \nexample dips to the southwest on Mount Perseus indicate a former eruption center 490 \nnortheast of the island. Vindication Island (1.5 x 3 km) consists of a similar lava 491 \n 21 \nsequence rising to 426 m at Quadrant Peak (Fig. 11C). The island group is 492 \ncompositionally bimodal, with basalts and basaltic andesites forming the older series 493 \non both Candlemas and Vindication, and andesites and dacites forming the younger 494 \nLucifer Hill lavas (Leat et al., 2003).  The recent cone and associated blocky lava 495 \nflows of the Lucifer Hill volcanic center are separated from the older series of 496 \nCandlemas Island by boulder and shingle spits and lagoons (Figs. 11D, E). The recent 497 \nlavas are interpreted to form lava deltas with a radius of ca. 1 km from the cone. 498 \nThere is no historical record of witnessed volcanic eruptions, but Lucifer Hill is 499 \nstrongly fumarolic. The boulder and shingle spits likely accumulated in the lee of the 500 \nLucifer Hill center, implying rapid sediment accumulation since the growth of that 501 \nvolcano. 502 \n  503 \nThe submerged Candlemas edifice is approximately circular in plan, with a diameter 504 \nof about 32 km above the 1800 m isobath (Fig.10). The submerged flanks slope 505 \nsteeply away from the islands on all sides, except to the north where the volcano 506 \nmerges with Ridge A. According to soundings (Hydrographic Office, 1989), an 507 \nextensive shallow shelf mostly less than 100 m in depth and about 12 km in diameter 508 \noccupies most of the unsurveyed area close to the islands (Fig. 11A). There are 509 \nnumerous small islands, sea stacks and shoals on the shelf, such as Tomblin Rock, 510 \nSanta Rock and Cook Rock that are interpreted as eroded remnants of formerly more 511 \nextensive subaerial volcanoes. The shelf is much less extended southeast and south of 512 \nCandlemas Island, but extends 5 km to the north and northwest of Candlemas and 513 \nVindication islands. None of the submarine features around the Candlemas island 514 \ngroup has been named and we use the informal names CA1-5 to identify the major 515 \npositive features and ECE, SCE, WCE and NCE to identify prominent embayments. 516 \n 22 \nThere is no strong E-W contrast in edifice structure and features are described 517 \nclockwise from the north. 518 \n 519 \nRidge CA1 forms the north flank of a 16 km wide east-facing embayment that we 520 \nname the East Candlemas Embayment (ECE), and that appears to consist of two parts 521 \n(ECE1 and ECE 2, Fig. 10). CA1 has a steep (up to 24\u00b0), 12 km long south-facing 522 \nslope that contrasts with its more gently sloping north-facing slope. The steep 523 \nsouthern slope of CA1 may be a collapse scar sidewall, suggesting that ECE is a 524 \nlarge, perhaps composite, collapse feature. CA2 forms the southern flank of ECE and 525 \nis relatively featureless with a steepened north-facing slope. The northern, central part 526 \nof the embayment, ECE1, is ca. 12 km wide,  generally smooth below 1000 m depth, 527 \nand is formed of coalescing minor landslide scars or chutes above that depth. The 528 \nsouthern part of the embayment, ECE2, is formed by a ca. 100 m deep, ca. 3.5 km 529 \nwide trough that appears to be superimposed on and younger than ECE1. To the east 530 \nof ECE2, below 2000 m there is indistinct hummocky topography, and ECE2 is 531 \ninterpreted as the more recently active chute for sediment mass movement. 532 \n 533 \nBetween CA2 and CA3, the South Candlemas Embayment (SCE) consists of three 534 \nsmall embayments 1.7 to 3 km in width that are separated by ridges. The head walls 535 \nof all three small embayments terminate at approximately 600 m depth. All are 536 \ninterpreted to be landslide scars, and are also probably chutes funnelling sediment 537 \naway from the shelf. To the southeast of these embayments, topography is dominated 538 \nby contour-parallel wave-like features on an underlying slope of 2-5\u00b0. The waves are 539 \nbranching, generally 1.4- 1.8 km wide and 50-150 m high, with their tops sloping 540 \nback toward the volcano, forming distinct hollows. This terrain is interpreted as a 541 \n 23 \nsediment wave field, possibly modified by slumping, formed by sediment discharging 542 \nfrom the three small embayments.  543 \n 544 \nCA3 and CA4 are relatively smooth ridges up to about 400 m high that form spurs 545 \nextending to the southwest. Their lower slopes consist of rounded terraces which are 546 \nsteep on their downhill margins. These terraces are interpreted as lava flows, and 547 \nridges CA3 and CA4 as constructional features.  548 \n 549 \nThe west flank of Candlemas consists of the relatively smooth and featureless West 550 \nCandlemas Embayment WCE (Fig. 10). This embayment occupies about 90\u00b0 of arc 551 \nbetween ridges CA4 and CA5. Above about 700 m the embayment divides into four 552 \nnarrow chutes. The floor of WCE is smooth above about 1600 m, and below that is 553 \nmore uneven. We interpret WCE as a largely constructional apron, probably covered 554 \nby sediment moving down-slope from the shallow shelf, probably as turbidity 555 \ncurrents, although the slopes lack prominent wave-like forms. 556 \n 557 \nCA5 is a smooth ridge that extends northwest from the islands and terminates at a 558 \nseamount rising to 950 m. CS5 is interpreted as a constructional volcanic ridge with 559 \nthe seamount representing a satellite volcano. The northeast-facing slope of CA5 560 \nforms the southwest flank of an asymmetrical embayment (North Candlemas 561 \nEmbayment, NCE in Fig. 10). A prominent 1.5 km across by 150 m high conical 562 \nhummock (H3 in Fig. 10) is interpreted as a volcanic cone. The floor of NCE south of 563 \nH3 and between 600 m and 1100 m consist of five step-like features widening to 1.4 564 \nkm wide at the base interpreted as a 5 km long by 3.5 km wide slump. A prominent 565 \nscarp follows the 1400 m contour and is marked by a ca. 50 m deep trough below a 566 \n 24 \n200 m high cliff. This appears to be the headwall of a separate, lower slump. The 567 \nslope between 1400 m and 1900 m is hummocky, with no clear linearity to features, 568 \nand may represent a debris avalanche deposit or slump. Below 1800 m, on slopes of 569 \n1-3\u00ba, indistinct contour-parallel sediment waves with wavelengths of about 2.2 km are 570 \npresent.   571 \n 572 \nThe Candlemas edifice contrasts with those of Zavodovski and Visokoi in having 573 \nlittle east-west asymmetry, although primary constructional forms occur only on its 574 \nwestern slopes, and sediment waves are more prominent to the east.  575 \n 576 \n5. Discussion 577 \nThe newly acquired data show a range of volcanic morphology formed by both 578 \nconstructional and erosional processes.  579 \n 580 \n5.1. Size and profiles of the volcanoes 581 \nThe size of the Protector Shoal seamounts (Table 1) may be compared to volcanoes of 582 \nthe Tonga-Kermadec arc (Wright et al., 2006; Massoth et al., 2007), which is also a 583 \ndominantly submarine, intra-oceanic arc. Volumes of individual Protector Shoal 584 \nseamounts, 9-83 km3 (excepting PS3) are similar to Tonga-Kermadec stratovolcanoes 585 \nand silicic caldera volcanoes (15-269 km3) (Wright et al., 2006).  The Protector Shoal 586 \nseamounts are also comparable in size to the smaller individual eruptive centers in 587 \nsubaerial arc volcanoes, such as South Soufri\u00e8re Hills-Soufri\u00e8re Hills dome complex 588 \non Montserrat which has a current subaerial volume of 12 km3 and an estimated total 589 \nsubaerially erupted volume of 30 km3 (Le Friant et al., 2004).  The nested caldera 590 \ncomplex PS7 is unique in the Protector Shoal area, but nested or multiple calderas of 591 \n 25 \nsimilar dimensions (Volcano 16, Volcano 19, Sonne volcano; Hinetapeka volcano, 592 \nPutoto volcanic center) are common in the Tonga-Kermadec arc (Wright et al., 2006; 593 \nMassoth et al., 2007; Graham et al., 2008). The strong association of submarine 594 \nstratovolcanoes and silicic calderas with hydrothermal activity and polymetalic 595 \nsulphide deposits in the Tonga-Kermadec (de Ronde et al., 2001; Baker et al., 2003; 596 \nMassoth et al., 2007) and Mariana and Izu-Bonin (St\u00fcben et al., 1992; Iizasa et al., 597 \n1999; Fiske et al., 2001) arcs suggests that the Protector Shoal seamounts may be 598 \nlikely sites for hydrothermal venting. As caldera structures and associated faults 599 \nlocalize hydrothermal activity, PS7 is a particularly promising vent search target.    600 \n  601 \nThe three main volcanoes, Zavodovski, Vioskoi and Candlemas are relatively large 602 \nstratovolcanoes. east-west profiles indicate that the volcanoes rise, from a base of 603 \napproximately 2500 m water depth (Fig. 12), to heights above this base of 3000-3500 604 \nm. Their basal diameters at the 2500 m level range from >53 km (Candlemas) to 57 605 \nkm (Visokoi) and 83 km (Zavodovski). Volcano volumes are approximately 2 200 606 \nkm3 (Candlemas), 3 000 km3 (Visokoi) and 5 400 km3 (Zavodovski). Profiles (Fig. 607 \n12) show that all the volcanoes are asymmetrical, having steep western flanks and, 608 \noverall, relatively gentle eastern flanks. This is consistent with the general erosional 609 \ncharacter of the eastern flanks of the volcanoes and the presence of young 610 \nconstructional features on their western flanks, and is interpreted to result from 611 \nmigration of active volcanic centers, especially Zavodovski and Visokoi, to the west 612 \nrelative to the underlying plate.  613 \n 614 \n5.2. Shallow Shelves  615 \n 26 \nShallow shelves occur around Zavodovski Island, the eastern side of Vioskoi, and the 616 \narea around Candlemas and Vindication islands. There are several possible origins for 617 \nthese shallow shelves: tectonic subsidence of wave-cut platforms, erosion of wave-cut 618 \nplatforms during times of low sea level; emplacement of lava deltas during times of 619 \nlow sea level; erosion along a lithological transition; and iceberg scouring. Similar 620 \nshallow shelves having similar widths occur on emergent arc volcanoes in many 621 \nvolcanic arcs, including Izu Bonin (Tani et al., 2008), Lesser Antilles (Le Friant et al., 622 \n2004), Aeolian (Favalli et al., 2005) and Aleutian (Coombs et al., 2007). The presence 623 \nof clearly erosional remnants projecting above the surface, most notably the older lava 624 \nseries on Vindication and Candlemas islands and sea stacks such as Cook Rock, is 625 \ntaken to indicate that the shelves are products of erosion and not emplacement of lava 626 \ndeltas. Icebergs derived from Antarctic ice shelves have keel depths of about 140-600 627 \nm and are known to scour substrate at these depths (Dowdeswell and Bamber, 2007). 628 \nLarge icebergs, mostly derived from the Ronne-Filchner ice shelf, are continuously 629 \npresent around the South Sandwich Islands and commonly become grounded on the 630 \nshallow shelves close to the islands. Although iceberg scouring must affect the 631 \nshallow shelves, it is not thought to have formed them, because shallow shelves are 632 \nclearly a global phenomenon, and not restricted to the reach of icebergs. There is no 633 \nevidence that the shallow shelves represent erosion along a lithological boundary. An 634 \nincrease in explosive generation of (easily eroded) fragmentary deposits during the 635 \ngrowth of a submarine volcano is likely, as eruption sites become shallower. This is 636 \nnot likely to form a well-defined boundary at <200 m, but more likely to be a gradual 637 \ntransition in explosive and fragmentation processes over a large and deeper range 638 \n(Kokelaar, 1986; Head and Wilson, 2003). Le Friant et al. (2004) showed that the 639 \nwidth of shallow shelf increased with increasing age of volcanism at Montserrat, 640 \n 27 \nLesser Antilles. This is strong evidence that the Montserrat shelves formed by erosion 641 \nat sea level during glacially controlled low stands, and not by tectonic subsedence. 642 \nWe follow this reasoning and interpret the South Sandwich shallow shelves as wave-643 \ncut platforms formed during low sea level stands.   644 \n 645 \n5.3. Primary constructional volcanic features 646 \nPrimary constructional volcanic features are identified as being amundant in the 647 \nsurvey area. The seamounts of the Protector Shoal area are dominantly constructional, 648 \nwith smooth slopes interpreted as tephra and volcaniclastic deposits draped over 649 \nlocally more bumpy lava terrain. There are small, ca. 1-2 km diameter satellite domes 650 \naround the larger volcanoes. The rugged topography of the submerged north, west and 651 \nsouth slopes of Visokoi is interpreted as constructional, with numerous domes, cones 652 \nor lavas up to 2 km in diameter.  653 \n 654 \nSeveral ridges on Zavodovski and Candlemas are interpreted as primary 655 \nconstructional volcanic features. The ridge from ZW5 to ZW6 southwest of 656 \nZavodovski is the clearest example. Its steep, rugged slopes do not appear to have 657 \nbeen affected by collapse, and the feature rises to a conical summit at 458 m depth, 658 \ninterpreted as a seamount. ZW2 on Zavodovski is interpreted as similar, but smaller, 659 \nalthough its northern slope appears to have been modified by sliding. CA3, CA4 and 660 \nCA5 on Candlemas are interpreted as constructional ridges. CA3 and CA4 are 661 \nassociated with terrace-like topography interpreted as lavas and do not appear to have 662 \nbeen modified by collapse. CA5 rises to a conical summit at 950 m depth and is 663 \ninterpreted as a seamount. All these ridges extend linearly either northwest or 664 \nsoutheast from the central volcanoes, implying structural control. They are interpreted 665 \n 28 \nto be the same as the fissure ridges described from the Kermadec-Tonga arc (Wright 666 \net al., 2006; Graham et al., 2008), and are interpreted as formed by eruption from 667 \nstructurally controlled dike systems.  668 \n 669 \n5.4. Mass wasting  670 \nThere is abundant evidence for extensive mass wasting of the northern South 671 \nSandwich arc. Erosional remnants, locally interpreted to expose trap-like volcanic 672 \nseries are widespread and there are many sediment chutes interpreted to channel 673 \nsediment down volcano flanks. We interpret a large number of collapse structures of 674 \nseveral different types from the morphological analysis that clearly indicate that mass 675 \nmovements occurred repeatedly during volcano evolution.  676 \n 677 \n 5.4.1 Sediment chutes 678 \nSediment chutes are interpreted to form a radial pattern on Zavodovski, with 679 \nprominent examples west of ZE1, between ZE1 and ZE3, and west of ZW3. On 680 \nCandlemas, a radial pattern of chutes is also evident. ECE2 is interpreted as a 681 \nsediment chute, while WCE, ECE1and SCE embayments are interpreted as broader 682 \naprons down which sediment is transported, all of which divide into narrow chutes 683 \nadjacent to the shallow shelf. All these chutes originate from shallow shelves around 684 \nislands, suggesting that the shelves are the sediment sources, and that the chutes 685 \nchannel sediment movement down volcano slopes. It some cases, such as the three 686 \nsmall embayments in SCE, chutes probably occupy former slide scars. Many of the 687 \nchutes, especially north and east of Zavodovski and south of Candlemas spatially 688 \ncorrelate with sediment wave fields down-slope, indicating sediment movement in the 689 \nchutes was as turbidity currents or other mass flows. The high rate of sediment supply 690 \n 29 \nto the chutes required to feed such flows is consistent with the evidence for high rates 691 \nof erosion in the coastal zone.  692 \n 693 \n5.4.2. Slide scars 694 \nThe 13 km long, 1.8 km wide scar on the southwest flank of seamount PS6 is 695 \ninterpreted as a slide scar. The scar has similarities with the Sciara del Fuoco on 696 \nStromboli volcano and transient slide scars observed on the cone of Monowai 697 \nvolcano, Kermadec arc. The Sciara del Fuoco collapse scar extends from the subaerial 698 \nto submarine environment and is the location of repeated sediment transport in events 699 \nthat range from mass failure landslides to small slides and gravity flows (Chiocci et 700 \nal., 2008a, 2008b; Romagnoli et al., 2009). The PS6 slide scar and Sciara del Fuoco 701 \nhave similar lengths (13-20 km) and widths (ca. 2 km at their proximal ends),  but the 702 \nSciara del Fuoco is steeper at its proximal end (>30\u00b0) than the PS6 scar (ca. 13\u00b0). The 703 \nseveral, transient, submarine slide scars that developed on Monowai volcano between 704 \n1998 and 2007 developed on a smaller cone, and are ca. 4 km long, and were caused 705 \nby sliding of unstable fragmental material on the steep (>20\u00b0) summit and upper 706 \nslopes of the cone (Chadwick et al., 2008). The PS6 scar is interpreted as a slide scar 707 \nformed by failure of fragmental material as small slides and gravity flows on its steep 708 \nupper slopes.  709 \n 710 \n5.4.3. Debris avalanches 711 \nThe term debris avalanche is used for rapidly-moving, catastrophic failures in which 712 \nrock masses are transformed into fragmented debris, and whose deposits form 713 \nhummocky or blocky terrain. These have been reported from submarine parts of many 714 \narcs including the Lesser Antilles (Deplus et al., 2001), Aleutians (Coombs et al., 715 \n 30 \n2007), Bismarck arc (Silver et al., 2005, 2009) and Japan Sea (Satake and Kato, 716 \n2001).  717 \n 718 \nThe Mount Curry collapse feature on Zavodovski (Figs. 7A, C) is interpreted to have 719 \nformed a debris avalanche. Importantly, the collapse occurred on the steep western 720 \nside of the volcano. The area (20 km2) and thickness (0.2 km) of shallow shelf 721 \nmissing in the collapse scar indicates a volume of ca. 4 km3 for the debris avalanche, 722 \nwhich probably occupies the area of indistinct hummocks extending to the edge of the 723 \nsurvey area. The entire structure has characteristics of major volcano flank collapses 724 \nforming large debris avalanches (Siebert, 1984; Siebert et al., 1987; Silver et al., 725 \n2005). The volume, vertical drop of about 3.1 km and travel distance of at least 30 726 \nkm, are consistent with the larger (>1 km3) debris avalanches associated with volcano 727 \nsector collapse (Siebert et al., 1987).  728 \n 729 \nThe hummocky terrain west of Visokoi below 2300 m is interpreted as probably being 730 \ndebris avalanche deposits. These are interpreted to have been derived from collapse of 731 \nthe steep, constructional western flank of Visokoi, and are associated with two chutes 732 \nin the steep western flank of Visokoi: any horseshoe scars representing the upper limit 733 \nof the collapse features might have been buried by later volcano growth. Collapses of 734 \nsimilar steep, submarine volcano flanks to form debris avalanches deposited as similar 735 \nhummocky terrains are found on Hawaii, the Canary Islands and Samoa (Lipman et 736 \nal., 1988; Keating et al., 2000; Mitchell et al., 2002). The ECE2 scar on Candlemas is 737 \na likely debris avalanche collapse feature, with a well-defined chute that has 738 \napparently eroded into the large ECE1 embayment, and hummocky topography below 739 \n 31 \n2000 m. Debris avalanche deposits may exist in the NCE on Candlemas, although 740 \nthese deposits cannot be interpreted unequivocally from the multibeam data. 741 \n 742 \n5.4.4. Slumps  743 \nSlumps, which used here include collapsed sediments (Keating et al., 2000; Tappin et 744 \nal., 2001; Tani et al., 2008) that were mostly coherent rather than fragmented, are 745 \nwidespread in the area. The slump on the south flank of seamount PS4 is particularly 746 \nclear, and interpreted as a slump because of its clearly related source within the south-747 \nfacing bowl, its confinement within inward-facing lateral walls and back-rotated 748 \nsteps. There is an insufficient sediment source for its steps to be sediment waves 749 \ngenerated by sediment transport from the summit of PS4, and an origin as eruption-750 \ngenerated mass flows is unlikely because of its well-defined lateral limits. It has a 751 \nwell-defined gradation of structure with distance from source, with progression from a 752 \nlarge upper rotated slump block, to tilted slump blocks (Fig. 5B).  In its lower part 753 \nimaged by TOPAS, evidence for block rotation is lost, and the sediment may have 754 \nbeen deposited as a disaggregated mass. It is interpreted to have moved initially as a 755 \nseries of rotated blocks, with deformation concentrated on an underlying slide surface. 756 \nThe progressive variations along the surface, confinement within a single set of 757 \ninward-facing walls and association with a single source bowl suggest it formed as a 758 \nsingle event, rather than repeated failure of the seamount slopes. 759 \n  760 \nSeveral similar features within the mapped area characterised by step-like components 761 \nof similar dimensions, often with distinct horseshoe-shaped source areas are also 762 \ninterpreted as slumps, although we cannot interpret whether deformation was by creep 763 \nor at a high rate. On Zavodovski, slumps with good evidence for head walls, inward-764 \n 32 \nfacing lateral walls and deposits that appear to have moved coherently, forming tilted 765 \nslump blocks, are interpreted to the east of ZW4 and possibly on the northern slope of 766 \nfeature ZW2. In the Candlemas NCE, there are two well-imaged slump structures. 767 \nThe occurrence of the slumps in an area of high seismicity suggests that they were 768 \ntriggered by earthquakes.  769 \n 770 \n5.4.5. Step-like features in eroded terrains 771 \nThe step-like features that occur on the 5-12\u00b0 northern flank of feature ZE1, locally on 772 \nthe southern flank of ZE3, and in adjacent chutes are distinctive. They are gently-773 \ndipping, about 70 m high, laterally continuous but pinch and swell in height and 774 \nextend across both chutes and adjacent flanks of positive features (Fig. 6). We 775 \ninterpret these as products of erosion of lava or sill-dominated sequences producing 776 \ntrap-like terrains. Their exposure is interpreted to have resulted from  repeated 777 \ncollapse of volcano edifices and scouring by turbidity currents and other mass flows. 778 \nA similar step-like geomorphological form is apparent on edifice \u2018Q\u2019 in the extinct 779 \nproto-Kermadec arc, which exposes volcanic basement on its steeper flanks (Graham 780 \net al., 2008).  781 \n 782 \n5.4.6. Sediment waves 783 \nUndulating, wave-like seabed morphologies have several different origins. Sediment 784 \nwaves can form as contourites or from turbidity currents (Damuth, 1979; Migeon et 785 \nal., 2000). Contourite sediment waves formed by sediment transport and deposition 786 \nfrom ocean currents are associated in the Scotia Sea region with the Antarctic 787 \nCircumpolar Current and northern outflow of Weddell Sea Deep Water (Pudsey, 788 \n2002; Cunningham et al., 2002; Maldonado et al., 2003). They have irregular forms 789 \n 33 \nand scales, and are controlled by sea floor topography and current directions. 790 \nSediment waves deposited from turbidity currents occur on continental margins, 791 \nflanks of volcanic islands and abyssal trenches (Normark et al., 2002). They form 792 \nfields of regular, rhythmic waves with axes approximately parallel to contours and are 793 \nassociated with a distinct source region and levee and overbank deposits related to 794 \nchannels which concentrate the turbidity current flow. Waves vary from 2 to ca. 70 m 795 \nin height, with wavelengths of 0.2 to 5 km and tend to migrate up slope (Damuth, 796 \n1979; Migeon et al., 2000; Wynn et al., 2000, 2002; Normark et al., 2002; Lee et al., 797 \n2002). Wave-like morphologies also occur due to deformation in slumps and down-798 \nslope creep, which may modify sediment waves, as proposed for sediment wave fields 799 \nassociated with the Bismarck volcanic arc (Hoffmann et at., 2010). Concentric ridges 800 \nmay also form from density flows associated with eruptions (Wright et al., 2006).  801 \n 802 \nThe sediment wave field that extends from Zavodovski to the east of the survey area 803 \n(Fig. 7D) is interpreted as formed from turbidity currents rather than as contourites. 804 \nThe evidence for this interpretation is that the waves parallel isobaths, are concentric 805 \nto the likely sediment source discharging from chutes east of the volcano, and the 806 \nfield has a central channel trending east from the chute between ZE2 and ZE3. The 807 \nclose spatial association of the sediment wave field with the chutes channeling 808 \nsediment from the shallow shelf indicates that the shelf was the main sediment source, 809 \nand the alignment of the chute between ZE2 and ZE3 with the central channel 810 \nsuggests this was a major transport route and the component northern and southern 811 \nfans of the sediment wave field may be interpreted as overbank deposits. The 812 \ninterpretation is consistent with the identification of sediments deposited from 813 \nturbidity flows in cores from the South Sandwich fore-arc (Howe et al., 2004). The 814 \n 34 \nwave field decreases in wavelength and height with distance from source, as expected 815 \nfor sediment waves derived from turbidity currents (Lee et al., 2000). The amplitude 816 \nof the larger sediment waves is in the upper range for sediment waves derived from 817 \nturbidity currents, suggesting strong, sediment-laden flows. The comparable, but 818 \nlarger, sediment wave field on the flanks of La Palma, Canary Islands (Wynn et al., 819 \n2000), for example, is typified by smaller wavelengths (0.4-2.4 km) and amplitudes 820 \n(<70 m). Hoffmann et al. (2010) demonstrated that otherwise comparable sediment 821 \nwave fields associated with volcanoes of the Bismarck arc show different wave 822 \nasymmetries, which they suggested is a result of variable down-slope deformation of 823 \nthe waves by slumping. The Zavodovski sediment wave fields have heterogeneous, 824 \nasymmetrical waves in their upper slopes, exposed boundaries between less and more 825 \nconsolidated sediments, mounds at the base of steeper slopes and tilted blocks 826 \nsuggesting that down-slope deformation of the sediment waves as they accumulated 827 \nwas pervasive.  828 \n 829 \n5.5. Migration of volcanoes  830 \nThe South Sandwich fore-arc is currently being eroded at the trench by subduction 831 \nerosion at 5.3 km Ma-1 (Vanneste and Larter, 2002; Larter et al., 2003). Assuming a 832 \nconstant slab dip, this suggests westward migration of volcanic centers at this rate 833 \nrelative to the underlying plate. Several features of Zavodovski and Visokoi suggest 834 \nsuch westerly migration, although Candlemas less so. These are the asymmetrical 835 \nform of the volcanoes, with steep western and shallow but incised eastern flanks, the 836 \noccurrence of all the interpreted constructional volcanic forms on the western side of 837 \nthe volcanoes, and the concentration of more eroded and sedimented terrains on their 838 \neastern flanks. Zavodovski shows these features well, in the migration of activity from 839 \n 35 \nthe east ridge to the west ridge with time. East ridge edifices ZE1-3 are interpreted as 840 \nextinct, eroded volcanic remnants, whereas the west ridge of the volcano, notably 841 \nZW2, ZW4, ZW5 and ZW6, are interpreted as constructional features on the same 842 \nloci of magmatism as the active volcanic island. At the rate of erosion calculated for 843 \nthe fore-arc, if ZE1, ZE2 and ZE3 originally erupted at the volcanic front, they 844 \nformed about 2-2.6 Ma, and Ridge A about 2-4 Ma.  845 \n 846 \n6. Conclusions 847 \nThe new multibeam data reveal, for the first time, the main volcanic features of the 848 \nnorthern part of the South Sandwich arc, and the mass-wasting process that affected 849 \nthem. 850 \n1. The Protector Shoal area consists of seamounts that range from 400 to 1400 m 851 \nin height, and have volumes up to 83 km3. PS7 has a 3 km diameter x 140 m 852 \ndeep nested summit caldera. Dredging shows that PS4 is rhyolitic in 853 \ncomposition, and the others are suspected of also being dominantly silicic. 854 \n2. Zavodovski, Visokoi and Candlemas are three large volcanoes, with heights of 855 \n3000-3500 m above surrounding sea floor and complex histories including 856 \ncollapse.  The volcanoes are asymmetrical, Zavodovski and Visokoi more so 857 \nthan Candlemas, having steep west flanks and gently sloping east flanks. 858 \n3. Zavodovski has an older eastern ridge and a younger western ridge on which 859 \nthe island is situated. The east of the volcano is strongly incised by erosion, 860 \nwith the development of chutes that channel sediment down-slope to be 861 \ndeposited in sediment wave fields. The western ridge is dominated by 862 \nconstructional volcanism, with a prominent fissure-fed ridge extending to the 863 \nsouthwest.  The western part of the island has collapsed as a debris avalanche. 864 \n 36 \n4. Visokoi has steep slopes on its north, west and south flanks, which have 865 \nrugged topographies interpreted as resulting from recent lava and dome 866 \neruptions. Its east flank joins with a strongly eroded ridge interpreted as 867 \nrepresenting an earlier phase of magmatism.  868 \n5. The Candlemas edifice includes the islands of Vindication and several sea 869 \nstacks. It has features interpreted as fissure-fed constructional volcanic ridges, 870 \nseparated by sediment-covered embayments affected by slumping. 871 \n6. The islands  have shallow shelves of variable depth, but mostly less than 160 872 \nm, and interpreted as wave-cut platforms eroded during times of low sea level. 873 \n7. There is abundant evidence for mass wasting processes affecting the 874 \nsubmarine edifices, including landsliding as debris avalanches and slumps. 875 \nErosion rates are high, due to glacial and coastal processes, generating large 876 \nsediment volumes on the shallow shelves. Such sediment is transported, 877 \nespecially to the east, from shallow shelves through chutes to the lower 878 \nvolcano slopes as turbidity currents and other mass flows, generating sediment 879 \nwave fields. Sediment wave fields appear to be modified by local slumping.  880 \n8. Most recent volcanism is generally on the west flanks of the volcanoes, while 881 \ntheir east flanks are interpreted as dominated by extinct, eroded features. The 882 \nvolcanoes are interpreted to have migrated to the west relative to the 883 \nunderlying plate, consistent with the rate of subduction erosion of the fore-arc 884 \nof 5.3 km Ma-1 (Larter et al., 2003). 885 \n 886 \nAcknowledgements 887 \nThis study is part of the British Antarctic Survey Polar Science for Planet Earth 888 \nProgramme.

Ridges CA1-5, embayments ECE1-2, SCE, WCE and NCE, and hill 1185 \nH3 are described in the text.  1186 \n 1187 \nFig. 11. A. Sketch of the Candlemas-Vindication area, showing the approximate area 1188 \ncovered by the shallow shelf, as defined by the 100 m contour (Hydrographic Office, 1189 \n1989; this survey), and the position of eroded sea stacks forming small islands. The 1190 \ndirection of view of photographs B-E are shown by arrows. B. Candlemas Island 1191 \nviewed from the southeast. Mounts Andromeda and Perseus consist of eroded basaltic 1192 \nlavas. Note the ice sheet between the two summits. C. Vindication Island viewed from 1193 \nthe southeast. The sea cliffs expose interbedded basaltic lavas and scoria. Cook Rock 1194 \nis the largest of several small islands and shoals between Vindication and Candlemas 1195 \nislands. D. The northern, recent part of Candlemas Island, viewed from the east. 1196 \nLucifer Hill is a recent volcano, surrounded by andesite and dacite blocky lava deltas. 1197 \nThe boulder beach joins the lavas to the northern slope of Mount Perseus, which 1198 \nforms the foreground and isolates Gorgon Pool from the ocean. The boulder beach 1199 \nand foreground is populated by a large colony of penguins. E. The western flank of 1200 \nLucifer Hill, looking southwest toward Vindication Island and Cook Rock. 1201 \nFumarolically altered scoria and lava form the foreground. The blocky lava flow is 1202 \nandesitic and has concentric pressure ridges. 1203 \n  1204 \nFig. 12.
