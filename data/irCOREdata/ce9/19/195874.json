Th at same year, the editor of \nHuman Mutation invited Arthur Beaudet and Lap-Chee \nTsui to produce a nomenclature for variants in genes and \nproteins [2]. From these simple beginnings, the last 17 \nyears have borne witness to the steady development of \nthe nomenclature used to describe sequence variation \nthat is now maintained under the auspices of the Human \nGenome Variation Society (HGVS) [3,4]. To some, the \npresent nomenclature may seem like an arcane art-form \njealously guarded by zealots. Th is may have been a valid \ncriticism in the past, but advances in human genetics \nmean that embracing the nomenclature fully is now \nessential. With the completion of the human genome \nsequence, the number of known variants has expanded \ndramatically, with many identifi ed as being associated \nwith medical conditions. For such variants, especially in \nthe clinical setting, the need to describe them syste-\nmatically is paramount [5-7].\nReference DNA sequences and their limitations\nA crucial element of variant nomenclature is the refer-\nence DNA sequence with respect to which a variant is \ndescribed. Ideally, the sequence should have been \nsubmitted to a primary DNA sequence database and be \nidentifi ed by an accession number and its version. For the \nmost part, this requirement is complied with nowadays, \nthough the quality of the sequence data is sometimes \nquestionable. For some genes, the de facto reference \nsequences were established before the advent of high-\nthroughput sequencing technologies. Intron and inter-\ngenic sequence data were often less reliable than those of \nthe exons for these legacy sequences due to the defi ciency \nof read-depth coupled with the lack of corroboration of \nthe DNA sequence against a corresponding protein. At \nthe start of the millennium, recognizing the need for \nAbstract\nAs our knowledge of the complexity of gene \narchitecture grows, and we increase our understanding \nof the subtleties of gene expression, the process of \naccurately describing disease-causing gene variants \nhas become increasingly problematic.

Genome Medicine 2010, 2:24 \nhttp:\/\/genomemedicine.com\/content\/2\/4\/24\nhigher quality reference data, the National Center for Bio-\ntechnology Information (NCBI) established a database of \ncurated non-redundant reference sequences of genomes, \ntranscripts and proteins known as RefSeq [8,9]. Until \nrecently, most human genomic DNA sequences \nrepresented in RefSeq have been of genomes rather than \nindividual genes. Consequently, the reporting of variants \nin genomic DNA coordinates using RefSeq genomic \ncontig sequences has been cumbersome, especially if the \ngene of interest lies on the reverse strand. For example, \nthe human COL1A1 gene is the reverse complement of \nbases 13535609 to 13553152 in the RefSeq record \nNT_010783.15. Beginning in 2007, RefSeq has been \nextended to embrace reference sequences for individual \ngenes through the creation of RefSeqGene records [10]. \nMany authors still prefer to report intronic sequence \nvariants in terms of cDNA coordinates (for example, \nc.2451+77C>T, or the now deprecated format, \nIVS36+77C>T), even though the nomenclature to do so is \nsomewhat awkward. However, the use of cDNA coordi-\nnates is permitted with RefSeqGene reference sequences.\nIn spite of these welcome developments, users of these \nsequences must be aware of the update policies of public \nsequence databases. Th ere are two types of modifi cation \nto a public sequence record: changes to the sequence, or \nchanges to the annotation or description of that \nsequence. Th e latter type of change is refl ected only by a \nchange to the modifi cation date of the record, and will be \nchanged if the gene symbol changes, citations associated \nwith the record change, or the position of features (such \nas the coordinates of exons) within that sequence are \nrevised. Th e former type of change - that is, to the se-\nquence itself - results in the incrementing of the version \nof the sequence. For example, the sequence of the desmo-\nglein 2 gene, DSG2, was revised from version \nNG_007072.1 to version NG_007072.2 in December \n2007. In May 2008, re-interpretation of the mRNA \ncoding regions of the sequence of NG_007072.2 resulted \nin a change of version number for the corresponding \nRefSeq mRNA record for DSG2 from NM_001943.2 to \nNM_001943.3 though no change to the RefSeq protein \nrecord NP_001934.2 was necessary. Th e RefSeqGene \ngenomic DNA record and the RefSeq protein record both \nretained the same version numbers as before, but the \nRefSeq mRNA record version was incremented. Anec-\ndotal evidence, especially from journal editors, suggests \nthat these issues are poorly understood by researchers \nwho fail to mention the version number of reference \nsequences that they have used as the basis for reporting \nsequence variants. Variant reports that do not clearly \ndefi ne the version of the used reference sequence might \nhave ambiguous interpretations.\nFailure to fully embrace the issues surrounding version-\ning of reference sequences can lead to inconsistency of \nvariant descriptions from one generation of patients to \nthe next. An individual testing positive for a given variant \ntoday may have children who, years later, wish to seek \ngenetic counseling and be tested for that same variant. To \navoid any misunderstanding or confusion by the \ncounselor and the staff  of the diagnostic laboratory, it is \nessential that changes to reference DNA sequences are \nclosely monitored by these parties to militate against the \npossibility of a change of description for the tested \nvariant (see Box 1 for a hypothetical example).\nAnother limitation is that current reference sequences \nmay not represent all transcripts that arise through the \nuse of distinct transcription start sites, alternative splic-\ning, or polyadenylation signals (Box 2). Currently, genomic \nreference sequences do not necessarily record all of the \nknown mRNAs, focusing instead on information con-\ncern ing the single most abundant mRNA. Ideally, a \nreference sequence for a gene would include all relevant \nspliced transcripts necessary for variant reporting, \nreducing the risk that an eff ect of the variant on an \nalternatively spliced transcript might be missed.\nA further limitation is that the present annotation \nscheme does not take account of well-established legacy \nBox 1. Nomenclature problems because of reference \nsequence versioning\nA clinical genetics centre treats Jenny, a patient with a family \nhistory of the RP10 form of autosomal dominant retinitis \npigmentosa caused by a variant in the IMPDH1 gene. The \nvariant was initially found in her father some time ago and is \ndescribed in a paper published just before he was diagnosed \nwith the disease. The paper cites the GenBank RefSeq mRNA \nrecord NM_000883 when describing the structure of the gene. \nThe variant is described using a nucleotide number from \nNM_000883 and a codon number from the translation product \nof that transcript. However, the version number of the GenBank \nrecord is not given in the paper and now, when the laboratory \nlooks in GenBank (by following a hyperlink to NM_000883 given \nin the online version of the paper) they fi nd that the current \nversion is NM_000883.3, with a date stamp in March 2010. The \nexon structure of the gene was revised in 2003 and this resulted \nin the base, codon and exon numberings being changed. The \nvariant reported in the literature is therefore no longer found at \nthe expected location in the mRNA and protein sequences.\nLaboratories specializing in this gene know that the numbering \nrelative to the start codon has changed and recognize this as \na potential source of error. Considerable eff ort is required to \ntranslate data in published papers and databases between \ndiff erent versions of reference sequences to gather the \ninformation needed to analyze cases like Jenny\u2019s. This extra \ncomplexity means that the service may take longer and be \nmore expensive than it otherwise might be. Unfortunately, \nnew variants in the IMPDH1 gene are still being described in \nthe literature without specifying the version of the reference \nsequence.\nDalgleish et al. Genome Medicine 2010, 2:24 \nhttp:\/\/genomemedicine.com\/content\/2\/4\/24\nPage 2 of 7\nnumbering schemata that are in use at present, or have \nbeen used in the past, to number features such as exons \nor amino acids. Th e globins and the collagens provide \nexcellent examples of legacy systems (Box 3). Ideally, \nreference sequences would be annotated in a fashion that \nwould allow for verifi cation of variants reported using \neither legacy or HGVS-compliant nomenclatures.\nTo address these limitations, a meeting sponsored and \norganized by the multi-institute European Union-funded \nGEN2PHEN project [11] was held, with representatives \nof GEN2PHEN (Genotype-To-Phenotype Databases \nProject), European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) [12] \nand NCBI [13] in attendance, to discuss the specifi cation \nfor stable reference genomic DNA sequences better \nsuited to the task of reporting variants. Th e participants \nwere geneticists, bioinformaticians, clinicians and Locus-\nspecifi c Database (LSDB) curators. In advance of the \nmeeting, a survey was conducted by GEN2PHEN with \nthe help of the HGVS [14] to assess the views of the \ncurators of LSDBs.\nTh e primary goal of the meeting was to create a \nuniversally acceptable standard: a new specifi cation for \nhuman genomic DNA reference sequences that would \naddress the shortcomings of non-standardized reporting \nresulting from a variety of issues. Th ese include the lack \nof universally agreed genomic reference sequences for \nsome genes even though mRNA, expressed sequence tag \nand genomic assembly records already exist. Sometimes, \nthere are DNA sequence inconsistencies between existing \nad hoc genomic reference sequences (where no \nRefSeqGene record has yet been created) and their NCBI \nRefSeq mRNA sequence counterparts. Inconsistent and \nincomplete (and sometimes outdated and inappropriate) \nannotation of existing ad hoc reference sequences and \nBox 2. Genes with multiple spliced transcripts\nMost human genes undergo alternative splicing, and perhaps \none of the most extreme examples is that of the calcitonin \ngene (CALCA), which produces two distinct peptide-hormone \nproducts: calcitonin (CT) in the thyroid gland and \u03b1-calcitonin \ngene-related peptide (\u03b1-CGRP) in the brain [35]. The two mature \npeptides have no amino acid sequence in common and arise \nfrom translation of alternatively spliced mRNAs. CT and \u03b1-CGRP \nare represented in RefSeq mRNA records NM_001033952 and \nNM_001033953, respectively, for the CALCA gene. The LRG record \nLRG_13 has been created for this gene.\nThe INK4a\/ARF multifunctional tumor-suppressor locus [36] \n(CDKN2A) provides an additional example of the need to record \nall clinically relevant transcripts. The gene comprises four exons \nwhose transcripts are alternatively spliced and encode both the \np16INK4a and p14ARF tumor-suppressor proteins. The unexpected \nfeature of this gene is that alternative fi rst exons used by the two \nmajor transcripts result in the shared exon 2 being translated \nin diff erent reading frames. The LRG record LRG_11 has been \ncreated for this gene.\nBox 3. Legacy numbering schemata\nThe amino acid sequence of several human globin chains [37] \nwas determined in the late 1950s and early 1960s by direct \nprotein sequencing prior to the advent of gene cloning and \nDNA sequencing. In these original sequences, the fi rst amino \nacid of the human \u03b1-, \u03b2- and \u03b4-globins is valine and that of \n\u03b3-globin is glycine. However, HGVS nomenclature numbers the \namino acids beginning with the methionine encoded by the \ninitiation codon. Consequently, the sickle-cell disease \u03b2-globin \nvariant, in which glutamic acid is replaced by valine, should be \nreported as being at position 7, rather than 6, according to HGVS \nrecommendations. Indeed, this variant is still described in OMIM \n(Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) [38] and in the HbVar \ndatabase for hemoglobin variants thalassemia mutations [39,40] \nin terms of the legacy amino acid numbering scheme.\nEven though non-standard, the legacy numbering of the globin \namino acids is well recognized by experts in the fi eld. However, \nthis is not true for newcomers or students who may blindly \nassume that standards are being applied and may become \neither completely lost or waste valuable time sorting out the \nproblem. The same is also true in the case of phosphoglycerate \nkinase 1 (PGK, encoded by the PGK1 gene), where considerable \nconfusion has arisen from describing variants in relation to \nalterations to the known mature amino acid sequence [41]. \nAgain, the issue arises because PGK is one of the few enzymes in \nwhich variants were characterized at the amino acid level prior \nto DNA sequencing being widely used.\nThe collagens also provide excellent examples of legacy \nnumbering schemes. Because of the lure of the characteristic \ntriple-helical nature of the collagens, numbering of the amino \nacids was established decades ago with the fi rst glycine of the \n(Gly-X-Y)n-repeat region being designated as amino acid number \n1. In addition, when the fi rst genomic DNA clones were isolated, \nexons were initially numbered in the 3\u2019 to 5\u2019 direction, a lack of full-\nlength cDNA clones hampering the determination of the exact \nnumber of exons. Consequently, the fi rst osteogenesis imperfecta \nvariant that was characterized was reported as being in exon 1 of \nthe COL1A2 gene, which encodes the \u03b12 chain of type I collagen \n[42]. In fact, the gene is now known to comprise 52 exons and the \nvariant lies in exon 52 using conventional numbering. However, \nother exon-numbering anomalies remain. The COL1A1 and \nCOL1A2 genes that encode the alpha chains of type I collagen \nare evolutionarily related but COL1A1 has a single exon that \ncorresponds to exons 33 and 34 of COL1A2. This single exon is \nknown as exon 33\/34 [43] and the designation, which is more \nthan 20 years old, is still widely used in the current literature.\nA further issue is the discovery of additional exons in genes where \nan exon-numbering scheme has already been established. This \nhas resulted in the opioid receptor, mu 1 gene (OPRM) having \nexons designated O, X and Y, with exons 3 and 5 divided into \ntwo and fi ve sub-regions, respectively [44], and the cystic fi brosis \ntransmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR) having exons \ndesignated 6a, 6b, 14a, 14b, 17a and 17b [45].\nDalgleish et al. Genome Medicine 2010, 2:24 \nhttp:\/\/genomemedicine.com\/content\/2\/4\/24\nPage 3 of 7\nmissing annotation of clinically relevant transcripts is an \nadditional problem. Present sequence record systems do \nnot provide support for legacy amino acid and exon \nnumbering schemes. Finally, the new standard needed to \naddress the lack of understanding of the signifi cance of \n\u2018versioning\u2019 of sequence data.\nTh e principles guiding the discussions with respect to \nthe specifi cations for genomic reference sequences were \nthreefold. First, the sequences need not represent real \nalleles of genes: they can be composites that provide a \npractical working framework for the reporting of \nvariants. Second, research or diagnostic laboratories, \nLSDB curators, mutation consortia, and so on that have a \ndirect interest in given genes will have the fi nal say in \ndefi ning the sequences and their annotation. Th ird, \nstability of the sequences, their core annotation, and their \nidentifi ers is essential to ensure consistency of variant \nreporting over time frames of many decades.\nTh e agreed solution was the concept of an LRG (Locus \nReference Genomic) [15], which builds on the initial \nideas from NCBI for RefSeqGene. LRGs will only be \ncreated in response to demand from the community \nwhich, in practice, is likely to be from LSDB curators or \nfrom diagnostic laboratories. LRGs are not restricted to \nprotein coding genes, but will be created for any region of \nthe genome within which sequence variation needs to be \nrecorded, including regulatory regions that encode \nRNAs. However, the mitochondrial genome is explicitly \nexcluded as its sequence (RefSeq NC_012920.1) and \nvariation is already managed by MitoMap [16]. Th e LRG \nsystem provides a genomic DNA sequence representation \nof a single gene that is idealized, has a permanent ID \n(with no versioning), and core content that never changes \n(that is, nucleotide sequence, transcripts, exons, start and \nstop codon positions). Th is core annotation will be \nknown as the \u2018fi xed-annotation layer\u2019. Although LRGs are \ncreated for single genes, some might encompass all, or \npart, of overlapping or adjacent genes, as currently \nhappens with RefSeqGene records. Th e LEPRE1 (leucine \nproline-enriched proteoglycan (leprecan) 1) LRG \n(LRG_5) also includes part of the C1orf50 (chromosome \n1 open reading frame 50) gene, which is encoded on the \nopposite strand. A separate LRG will be created for \nC1orf50 if there is a request from the community.\nAdditional annotations, known as the \u2018updatable-anno-\ntation layer\u2019, that may change with time (each item \ncarrying its own date stamp) will provide ancillary infor-\nma tion about a gene. Such annotations will include \ndetails of additional transcripts and information for \nmapping the LRG sequence onto genome assemblies (for \nexample, currently NCBI 36 and Genome Reference \nConsortium Human (GRCh) 37) as well as cross-\nreferencing of features in the fi xed-annotation layer to \nlegacy coordinate systems.\nMore than one LRG can be created for a region of \ninterest, should the need arise. If essential changes to any \nof the core sequence data are required, such as the need \nto include a newly discovered upstream exon, a new LRG \nrecord will be generated with a new ID. Sequence \nvariants may be validly expressed with reference to the \noriginal LRG (which will not be retired) or to its \nreplacement. An LRG provides a stable sequence and \nnumbering system against which samples can be com-\npared and variation be reported. Although annotation is \nprovided, the LRG is not intended to aggregate and \nreport all known variants.\nVariation will be reported using HGVS nomenclature \n[4] and the use of an LRG as the reference standard \nsupports all coordinate systems: using genomic DNA \ncoordinates, LRG_1:g.8463G>C is equivalent to \nNG_007400.1:g.8463G>C; using coding DNA coordi nates, \nLRG_1t1:c.572G>C is equivalent to NM_000088.3:c.572G>C; \nusing protein coordinates, LRG_1p1:p.Gly191Ala is equi-\nva lent to NP_000079.2:p.Gly191Ala. As a feature of the \nLRG project, the coordinate system of a RefSeqGene that \nmatches an LRG will be so indicated and will not be \nchanged.\nLRGs aff ord three key improvements in comparison \nwith RefSeqGene records. LRGs provide a \u2018one-stop\u2019 \nsequence record for a gene (with a single accession \nnumber) comprising sequences for the gene itself, all of \nthe transcripts essential for the reporting of sequence \nvariants, and the corresponding predicted proteins \ntranslated from each transcript. Th e locking of the \nsequences within the LRG means that \u2018version-control\u2019 is \nnot an issue in the reporting of sequence variants. No \nsequence (genomic DNA, mRNA or protein) within the \nfi xed layer will ever be changed or removed. Finally, the \ninclusion of the necessary data facilitates reference to \nfeatures, such as exons or amino acids, using legacy \nnumbering or naming schemes.\nImplementing LRGs\nNCBI continues to identify genes of clinical interest and \ncreate RefSeqGene records [10]. In March 2010, \nRefSeqGene sequences were available for more than \n2,800 genes and many of these are already in use in \nLSDBs. To ease the transition towards the use of LRGs, \nthey will be created from any pre-existing RefSeqGene \nrecord. Th e goal is to maximize the similarities. When a \nRefSeqGene record is assigned an LRG accession, it \nmeans that the sequence, transcripts, proteins and exons \nare identical for that version of the RefSeqGene and the \nLRG. In other words, it will make no diff erence if variants \nare reported in LRG or RefSeqGene coordinates.\nXML was chosen for exchanging and storing LRGs \nbecause of its ease of extensibility and validation as well \nas its natural hierarchical structure, which lends itself \nDalgleish et al. Genome Medicine 2010, 2:24 \nhttp:\/\/genomemedicine.com\/content\/2\/4\/24\nPage 4 of 7\nwell to the nature of the information in LRGs. Th ere are \nnumerous existing programmatic tools for defi ning, \nvali dat ing, parsing and transforming XML. Th e XML \nschema is defi ned using Relax NG [17] and is available \non the EBI FTP site [18]. XSLT style-sheets have been \nproduced that will transform the XML into more user-\nfriendly HTML or plain text. Th ese are also available \nfrom the FTP site.\nTh e LRG fi le has separate XML sections for the fi xed-\nannotation and updatable-annotation layers. Within the \ntags for the fi xed layer are the genomic sequence and \ntranscripts that defi ne the LRG, together with the \ncorresponding cDNA sequence, amino acid sequence \nand exon coordinate markup. Th e updatable section con-\ntains database cross-references, reports of any over-\nlapping LRGs, detailed information on how the LRG \nmaps to the human genome assembly and information to \nmap systematic exon and amino acid coordinates onto \ntheir legacy equivalents.\nLRGs will be compiled and maintained by the NCBI \nand EBI. Th is will ensure that the data contained in LRGs \nare accurate and consistent with data in other existing \nsequence records. Th e key involvement of these organiza-\ntions means that the LRG format has an assured long-\nterm future on which users can rely beyond the end of \nthe GEN2PHEN project.\nDownloading and viewing LRGs\nTh e LRG website [15] provides access to existing LRG \nrecords and mechanisms for requesting new LRGs. Before \nmaking a request, it is advisable that users familiarize \nthemselves with the complete LRG specifi cation [19], \nwhich is available on the LRG website, and feedback is \ninvited on any aspect of the specifi cation.\nTo facilitate viewing of LRGs, Ensembl [20,21] has \nadapted their browser. NCBI supports displays of LRG \nsequences and reported variants using client software \n(NCBI Genome Workbench [22]) and the graphical se-\nquence viewer [23]. Use of these tools facilitates integra-\ntion of LRG data variant data in dbSNP (NCBI Database \nof Genetic Variation) [24,25]. Th e NGRL Universal \nBrowser (National Genetics Reference Laboratory, Man-\nchester;) already provides a graphical view of LRGs [26] \nwith the ability, for some genes, to display tracks linked \nto dbSNP and to appropriate LSDBs.\nA major issue with variant curation is how DNA \nsequences might be visualized to make the process \nsimpler and less prone to error. Journal editors and \nreferees are well aware of the frequency with which \nauthors report variants erroneously. Ideally, a browser \nwill be developed that will integrate fully with the \ncommonly used LSDB systems, such as LOVD (Leiden \nOpen Variation Database) [27,28], UMD (Universal \nMutation Database) [29,30] and MUTbase (Maintenance \nand Analysis of Mutation Databases on the World Wide \nWeb) [31,32], allowing curators and submitters to auto-\nmatically generate standards-compliant variant descrip-\ntions using the LRG sequences as a reporting reference \nstandard.\nTools such as Mutalyzer [33,34], both in its standalone \nform and through the API used by the LOVD variant \ndatabase system, have made the process of correctly \nnaming variants relative to all annotated transcripts and \nprotein isoforms much simpler, but more sophisticated \nvariant-visualization systems would be a welcome \ndevelopment. Just as with Mutalyzer, such systems would \nparse the annotated features of reference DNA sequences \nto provide the necessary visual cues to help generate an \nHGVS-nomenclature-compliant description of any \nvariant. Ideally, such a system would incorporate cross-\nchecking with legacy numbering systems. To achieve \nthis, a robust and comprehensive feature-annotation \nscheme with a controlled vocabulary will be essential. \nTh e LRG specifi cation does not specifi cally entail the \nproduc tion of a dedicated sequence browser, but produ-\ncing one that uses LRG sequences would facilitate the \nsuccessful adoption of LRGs. To this end, the LRG XML \nschema is fully open and has version control, allowing \nany party, commercial or public, to develop visualization \ntools.\nClosing remarks\nTh e LRG specifi cation is the culmination of considerable \ndebate among those participating in the project and has \nalso been fashioned by the advice of external com men-\ntators. Most of the proposals have been accepted readily, \nbut two in particular have been controversial. Th e fi rst is \nthe proposal to allow addition of transcripts to the fi xed-\nannotation layer. Th e argument is that this amounts to \nversioning and does not solve the existing version \nproblem. Versioning is an issue with traditional reference \nsequence records because the actual sequences diff er \nfrom version to version for records with the same \naccession number. In the fi xed-annotation layer of the \nLRG, the sequence data for the genomic DNA, the \ntranscripts and their translation products will never be \nchanged or removed. Consequently, a variant description \nsuch as LRG_13:g.8290C>A will always remain valid and \nwill not be subject to misinterpretation.\nLikewise, the proposal to allow more than one LRG for \nthe same gene region has also provoked similar argu-\nments about versioning. If it is no longer possible to \ndescribe a sequence variant in terms of an existing LRG, \nit might be necessary to create a totally new LRG with a \nuniquely diff erent number (for example, LRG_1275 \ninstead of the existing LRG_89). Th e original LRG will \nnot be \u2018retired\u2019 and it will remain valid to describe \nvariants with respect to that sequence record. Creation of \nDalgleish et al. Genome Medicine 2010, 2:24 \nhttp:\/\/genomemedicine.com\/content\/2\/4\/24\nPage 5 of 7\nadditional LRGs for an existing gene or genomic region \nwill only be considered in the most exceptional circum-\nstances and each will be cross-referenced with the other \nin the updatable annotation layer.\nFinally, queries have been raised about the ability of \nLRGs to support the reporting of copy number variation \n(CNV). LRGs are no less well suited to the task of CNV \ndescription than existing reference sequence records. \nRequests will be considered for the creation of a new \nLRG representing a particular allele with respect to CNV \nand we will work with the requesting party to achieve the \nbest practicable solution to represent the allele. Again, \nthis will only be considered in the most exceptional \ncircumstances. Th e issues that have been raised during \nthe development of the LRG specifi cation are the subject \nof a frequently asked questions (FAQs) page, accessible \nfrom the LRG home page.\nIn the absence of any proposals of alternative solutions \nto deal with these issues, we feel that LRGs provide a \npragmatic solution to the needs of LSDBs and clinical \nlaboratories with respect to reporting sequence variants \nin a stable fashion.\nLRG timeline\nInitial discussion of the need for improved reference \nsequences suited to the task of curation of variants in \nLSDBs took place at the fi rst general assembly meeting of \nthe GEN2PHEN project in January 2008. Immediately \nfollowing that meeting, a survey was distributed to LSDB \ncurators through the HGVS and the results were analyzed \nin March 2008. In April 2008, a two-day workshop was \nheld at EBI to formulate the specifi cation of an improved \nreference sequence that is now known as Locus Reference \nGenomic (LRG). Creation of the formal LRG specifi cation \nbegan in May 2008 and several versions were produced in \nresponse to internal discussion and to feedback elicited \nthrough the HGVS. Th e current version (version 12) was \nagreed in June 2009.\nCreation and revision of the LRG XML schema began \nin March 2009 (currently at version 1.6) and the fi rst LRG \nrecords were created in June 2009. At present, LRGs have \nbeen fi nalized for ten genes and a further four await fi nal \napproval. Requests have been received for approximately \n90 additional genes and these are currently in production. \nWe invite enquiries concerning the creation of additional \nLRGs.\nAvailability\nAccess to further information and to LRG sequence \nrecords is available at [15]. A search facility is provided \nand there is a link to frequently asked questions (FAQs). \nSpecifi c links are provided to request technical support, \nto request the creation of new LRGs and to allow \nfeedback on the LRG specifi cation.\nAbbreviations\nCNV: copy number variation; EBI: European Bioinformatics Institute; \nGEN2PHEN: Genotype-To-Phenotype Databases Project; HGVS: Human \nGenome Variation Society; LOVD: Leiden Open Variation Database; LRG: Locus \nReference Genomic; LSDB: Locus-specifi c Database; NCBI: National Center for \nBiotechnology Information.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors\u2019 contributions\nThe manuscript was drafted by RD with contributions from FC, GP and AD. \nThe manuscript was edited by RD, PF, FC, CB, HL, PEMT, JTdD, AD and DRM. \nRD, PF, CB, HL, PEMT, JTdD, EB, AJB and DRM participated in the conceptual \nbasis and design specifi cation of LRGs.
