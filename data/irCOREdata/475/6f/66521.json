The use of the NAOMI system gives an\nimproved image resolution of \u223c 0.15 arcsecs at a wavelength of 2.2\u00b5m. This enables the\nOptimised Stellar Coronagraph for Adaptive optics (OSCA) to suppress stellar light\nusing smaller occulting masks and thus allows regions closer to bright astronomical\nobjects to be imaged. OSCA provides a selection of 10 different occulting masks with\nsizes of 0.25 - 2.0 arcsecs in diameter, including two with full greyscale Gaussian\nprofiles. There is also a choice of different sized and shaped Lyot stops (pupil plane\nmasks). Computer simulations of the different coronagraphic options with the NAOMI\nsegmented mirror have relevance for the next generation of highly segmented extremely\nlarge telescopes.\nKey words: instrumentation: adaptive optics, miscellaneous;\n1 INTRODUCTION\nCompared to a standard coronagraphic imaging system, one\nwith adaptive optics (AO) gives much higher spatial reso-\nlution and a high dynamic range allowing the environments\nof bright objects to be studied closer in than ever before\n(Malbet 1996). Additional instrumentation used in combi-\nnation with a coronagraph allows other new areas of research\nto be pursued. There are few coronagraphs that have this\nfacility, e.g. CIAO on Subaru, which has a choice of linear po-\nlarimeters (Murakawa 2003) and OSCA on the WHT, which\nhas a spectroscopic capability (with the OASIS integral field\nunit).\nThe adaptive optics system at the WHT, NAOMI, con-\nsists of a single Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor normally\nusing 8\u00d7 8 sub-apertures and a 76-element segmented mir-\nror. This is a reasonably high-order AO system and can offer\npartial correction for wavelengths down to 700nm. NAOMI\nhas been at the telescope since 2000 and during early 2003\nwas moved to a new environment-controlled laboratory at\nthe opposite Nasmyth platform. This provides a more dust-\nfree and thermally stable environment and so should im-\nprove the performance of the system (Myers 2003).\nOSCA is a fully deployable instrument which when in\nuse leaves the focus of the NAOMI beam unchanged. This\n\u22c6 E-mail: sjt@star.ucl.ac.uk (SJT)\nenables OSCA to be used in conjunction with a number\nof instruments that have already been commissioned at the\nWHT (Fig. 1). The main imaging camera used with OSCA\nis the Isaac Newton Group Red Imaging Device (INGRID);\na 1024 \u00d7 1024 element HgCdTe cooled near-IR detector at\nthe NAOMI focus. The pixel scale when used with NAOMI\nis \u223c0.04 arcsec\/pixel, hence Nyquist sampling is only ob-\ntained down to H-band (1.6\u00b5m). Prior to the detector but\nwithin the camera cryo-chamber are a set of 3 wheels con-\ntaining broadband filters (Z - K), narrowband filters and a\nchoice of pupil stops respectively. OSCA also has the option\nof being used in conjunction with an integral field spectro-\ngraph (OASIS) for imaging and spectral analysis at visible\nwavelengths.\nAn important criterion in creating a high contrast imag-\ning system is keeping scattered light to a minimum. Com-\npared to other AO coronagraphs, the system at the WHT\nallows the insertion of an occulting mask in a focal plane be-\nfore the AO system as well as those in the focal plane within\nthe AO. Ideally this \u2018pre-AO\u2019 mask would be made of a\ndichroic material that is transparent to the wavelengths used\nfor wavefront sensing and opaque to the science\/observation\nwavelength. The many square segments in the NAOMI adap-\ntive mirror contribute more scattered light than a similar\nsized continuous face-sheet mirror and the gaps between the\nsegments also have a higher emissivity in the infra-red, so\nthis additional pre-AO stop for the NAOMI-OSCA system\n2 S. J. Thompson, A. P. Doel et al.\nFigure 1. OSCA installed at the GRound based Adaptive optics Controlled Environment (GRACE) at the William Herschel Telescope.\nThe light from NAOMI enters from the left through the dichroic and exits to the INGRID detector shown at the right-hand side of the\npicture. For scale, the hole spacing on the optical table is 25mm.\ncould be extremely useful in cutting down scattered light at\nthe science wavelengths and thus improving sensitivity in the\nfinal image. An additional means of reducing the diffraction\neffects of the segmented mirror subsequent to the applica-\ntion of a focal occulting mask is the use of a Lyot (pupil)\nmask that is matched to the segmented mirror. Such a mask\nis shown in Fig. 2 (inset top, left-hand mask) and discussed\nin \u00a73.2.\nOSCA was commissioned at the WHT in mid-2002 and\nbecame available for general use in 2003b. The OSCA + OA-\nSIS option is currently unavailable although work is being\nplanned to rectify the problem.\n2 DESIGN OVERVIEW\nOSCA (Thompson 2003) is based on the classic Lyot (Lyot\n1939) coronagraph design. The sizes of the focal plane masks\n(0.25 - 2.00 arcsec) were chosen to take advantage of the im-\nproved point-spread function (PSF) offered by NAOMI. Ten\nfocal plane masks are available for selection on the instru-\nment. One is for alignment purposes only and two are of a\nmore novel Gaussian profile compared to the standard hard\nedged circular discs.\nThe standard focal plane (occulting) masks are made\nof chromium, deposited on the substrates by a contact-\nphotolithography process. Computer simulations, both here\n(in \u00a73) and by others (Nakajima 1994), have shown that oc-\nculting masks of a Gaussian profile give better suppression\nthan the standard solid disc design. However creating such\na mask is not trivial. Canyon Materials Ltd have a patented\nglass formula, HEBS (High Energy Beam Sensitive)-glass,\nwhich behaves in a similar way to photographic film. HEBS-\nglass is sensitive towards electron-beam exposure whereby\nexposure with a certain electron-beam dosage changes the\noptical density of the material. In this way the HEBS-glass\ncan act as a mask material and by varying the electron-beam\nexposure different greyscale (optical density) levels can be\nwritten into the glass (Walter 1996). To create the Gaus-\nsian profile masks for OSCA (Fig. 3) 669 different greyscale\nlevels were written in ring steps of 0.5\u00b5m width. One re-\nstriction on their usage is that the glass is only suitable for\nthe wavelength range 0.4 - 0.8\u00b5m. There is a visible camera\nResults from the AO coronagraph at the WHT 3\nFigure 2. Standard OSCA Lyot mask mounted on a step-motor\nrotation stage. Other available Lyot masks are shown inset.\nFigure 3. White light images of the OSCA Gaussian profiled\nHEBS occulting masks. Speckles are dust in the CCD camera.\non OASIS, so these masks were included in OSCA with this\nuse in mind.\nThe pupil plane masks are manufactured from 0.25mm\nthick, hard stainless steel by a process of photo-chemical ma-\nchining. Since OSCA is located at a Nasmyth focus of the\ntelescope, the telescope field derotator (which ensures the\nobservation object does not rotate as the telescope tracks\non its alt-az mounting) has the effect of rotating the tele-\nscope pupil. Since the standard Lyot mask used in OSCA\nincludes vane masking, the Lyot mask must be rotated to\nmaintain the alignment with the telescope pupil image. The\nstandard Lyot mask mounted on a Newport SR50 step mo-\ntor rotation stage is shown in Fig. 2. Additional pupil stops\n(non-rotating) were manufactured at the ING to go in the\nINGRID pupil filter wheel. These provide cooled masks for\nOSCA which are particularly important for observing in K-\nband otherwise the thermal background noise is very high.\nAn important requirement of the optical design was to\nensure that the focal position was unaltered with OSCA de-\nployed in the beam path and since space is very limited on\nthe optical table, to fit this design into a very small spatial\nenvelope (see Fig. 1). The optical specifications were that it\nshould be diffraction limited at a wavelength of 2.2\u00b5m over\nthe full field of view and have less than 0.1 arcsec distortion\nover the field for the full wavelength range. Additionally,\nthe system has an exit pupil in the same position as that for\nFigure 4. OSCA ray-trace. The sequence of optical components\nis numbered and the original NAOMI beam (without OSCA) is\noverlaid to show the focus at INGRID (circled) unchanged.\nNAOMI so providing an unchanged optical interface to sub-\nsequent optics which were designed to work with NAOMI.\nThe field of view for OSCA is designed to be 20 arcsec, but\nghosting within the INGRID camera optics has currently\nreduced this to 15 arcsec. The system also has a 1:1 magni-\nfication to leave the NAOMI field-scale unchanged. To ac-\ncommodate the required wavelength range of 0.4 - 2.4\u00b5m all\nmirrors in the system were coated with protected silver on\nZerodur. Similarly all transmissive optics were made from an\ninfra-red (IR) grade fused silica (Spectrosil WF) which gives\nover 90% transmission across the entire specified wavelength\nrange and can be polished to a very high surface quality.\nTo prevent ghosting within OSCA the substrates for the\nfocal plane masks have a slight wedge angle. The wedges are\nalso tilted slightly in the design, to ensure the ghost beam\nmisses the pupil. This is achieved by aligning the whole oc-\nculting mask filter-wheel assembly at a slight angle to the\nbeam and checking that the ghost-beam is thrown com-\npletely out of the optical path.\nThe path of light through OSCA is shown in Fig. 4 and\nis numbered sequentially along the beam direction. When\ndeployed in the NAOMI beam, flat mirror (1) picks up the\nbeam. The occulting masks are located at the focal plane\n(2). The Lyot stop is located at the pupil plane (4). The\nmirrors at (3) and (5) are a pair of off-axis paraboloids,\nand finally the flats at (6) and (7) position the focus to the\noriginal NAOMI focal position.\nThe important mechanical requirements of the OSCA\nsystem were for it to be thermally stable from -5\u25e6C to 25\u25e6C\n(i.e. positional accuracy is held within the specified toler-\nances and that the components will function correctly), vi-\nbrationally stable, for none of the components to infringe\nupon the beam path within or outside of OSCA, the entire\nsystem to be deployable in and out of the beam with a re-\npeatability of \u00b150\u00b5m, the centre of the focal plane masks\nto be automatically positioned to \u00b110\u00b5m, 5 year compo-\n4 S.

Doel et al.\nnent lifetime (standard ING requirement) and for the heat\noutput to be minimised so as not to interfere with INGRID.\nThe unit can be automatically deployed to interrupt the\nbeam passing through to INGRID and the OASIS pick-off\nmirror. A vertical deployment was implemented due to the\nspace restrictions. From Fig. 1 it can be seen that OSCA\ncomprises of a base plate which is rigidly clamped to the\nbench and a top plate on which all the opto-mechanical com-\nponents are seated. Deployment is achieved by the top plate\npivoting about a groove and cone of hardened stainless steel\nat the first off-axis paraboloid end of OSCA with a pneu-\nmatic actuator at the second off-axis paraboloid end to bring\nthe plate up into the beam.\nThe focal masks are located within a wheel that can\nbe automatically selected from the control room. Each fo-\ncal mask is re-located to high precision by use of notches\naround the mounting wheel and a pneumatically deployed\narm which locks into the notches (detent-arm). This facility\nalong with the capability to deploy OSCA into and out of\nthe beam accurately and automatically allows for a flexible\nand versatile observing program over the course of a night.\n3 SYSTEM SIMULATIONS\nComputer simulations were written and run for a corona-\ngraphic system with a segmented adaptive optics corrector\n(as in NAOMI). A program that generates Kolmolgorov type\nturbulence phase-screens (Lane 1992) was used as the input\nto the simulation. This program does not incorporate the\nouter scale of atmospheric turbulence, although this effect\nis negligible over a 4m aperture.\nUnless stated otherwise, the simulations discussed here\nused a phase-screen (aperture) size of 256\u00d7256 padded with\nzeros to four times its size for the fast Fourier transforms\n(FFT), giving a 1024 \u00d7 1024 focal plane. In the final im-\nage this results in a higher resolution than that achieved\nby INGRID. The AO and coronagraph code were developed\nin Matlab (Thompson 2004) based on an original C-code\nby A.P. Doel. The simulations include photon noise in the\nwavefront sensor, mirror hysteresis and pixel noise in the\ndetector.\n3.1 Effect of focal mask properties on\nperformance\nThe chromium disc focal plane masks in OSCA were mea-\nsured to transmit more light at longer wavelengths. To model\nthe effect this might have on the suppression performance,\na set of simulations were performed using a 1 arcsecond disc\nmask function with transmission values of 0, 0.1, 1 and 10%.\nThese transmission levels are equivalent to neutral density\n(ND) values of \u221e, 3, 2 and 1. A 2000 phase-screen AO sim-\nulation with the coronagraph using an 80,20 (80% primary\nmasking, 120% secondary masking) Lyot stop was run for\neach of these disc transmissions and the results plotted in\nFig. 5.\nThe suppression factors (no coronagraph\/with coron-\nagraph) for these masks measured at a radius of 1 arcsec\n(i.e. 0.5 arcsec from the edge of the mask), starting with\nthe 0% transmission are: 4.80, 4.80, 4.65 and 3.83 respec-\ntively. Therefore for small amounts of transmission, 1% and\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5\n103\n104\n105\n106\n107\n108\n109\nradius (arcsec)\nlo\ng \n(P\nSF\n)\nno coronagraph\n10% transmission\n1% transmission\n0.1% transmission\n0% transmission\nFigure 5.

Simulated PSF profiles for the different shaped coro-\nnagraphic focal masks, the standard (80,20) Lyot stop was used\nfor each. Characteristic width for each mask is 1.0 arcsec. Phase-\nscreens corrected with a NAOMI-like simulated system - 2000,\n256 \u00d7 256 phase-screens with an 4 times FFT padding factor.\nPeak for no-coronagraph lies at 7\u00d7 108.\nless, there is negligible loss of suppression performance com-\npared to a totally opaque mask. For a 10% transmission\nmask the difference becomes significant, with the factor loss\nin suppression measured at 1 arcsecond radius being 1.25\ncompared to the opaque mask.\nSimulations were also performed for a wide variety of\ndifferent shaped focal masks, Fig. 6 shows the simulated\nsuppression profiles of those mask types most relevant for\nOSCA. As expected, the best suppression close in to the\nmask (0.5-1.0 arcsec) is achieved by using a Gaussian shaped\nfocal mask. For distances > 2 arcsec the disc mask with\na pre-AO stop gives the best suppression. The segmented\nadaptive mirror contributes a significant amount to the\ndiffracted\/scattered light in the image, so reducing the un-\nResults from the AO coronagraph at the WHT 5\nFigure 7. (a) Simulated WHT aperture function; (b) as in (a) but\nwith an approximate NAOMI segmented mirror pattern applied.\nwanted light falling on the mirror acts to reduce the back-\nground. The effect of smoothing the edges of sharp-edged\nmasks and using Gaussian profiled masks improves the sup-\npression by reducing additional diffracted light in the pupil\nplane (see the result of diffraction in the pupil plane by a\nhard-edged mask in Fig. 9(b)). This then increases the ef-\nficiency of the Lyot mask in removing the light in the re-\nmaining wings of the PSF. The light from remainder of the\nPSF, when viewed at the next pupil plane is then mostly\nconcentrated about the edges of this aperture image (pri-\nmary, secondary, vanes, segment edges etc.), i.e. the parts\nof the aperture image that contain the most high spatial\nfrequencies.\n3.2 Effect of a segmented mirror on performance\nThere are a number of additional factors which need to be\ntaken into consideration when designing a coronagraph with\nan adaptive segmented mirror. The segmentation pattern\nwill cause additional unwanted diffraction effects which dis-\ntribute light away from the central maximum, this includes\nthe gap between the segments and any phase effects due\nto step mismatching between the segments. The pupil in\nOSCA (no focal or Lyot mask) is illustrated in Fig. 7. The\nnormalised peak intensity ratio of the PSF produced by this\naperture compared to the same aperture without segmenta-\ntion (with no phase mismatching) is 0.97. From this simple\ncalculation it is seen that a segmented AO system is of lower\ncontrast by design compared to a continuous face-sheet mir-\nror.\nHowever, the loss in performance when using a corona-\ngraph with a segmented mirror is much more than 3%. The\nreason for this is can be seen by examining the distribution\nof light in the pupil plane after the application of the fo-\ncal stop, an example is given in Fig. 9(a). For the case of\na Gaussian focal plane mask applied to the PSF obtained\nby using the aperture in Fig. 7(b), it is found that 45% of\nthe total light in the pupil is distributed about the segment\nedges. So if a normal Lyot mask is used here (primary, sec-\nondary and vane masking) a significant proportion of the\nlight from that remaining of the masked star will stay in the\nfinal image, thus reducing the suppression performance.\nThe use of a more complex Lyot mask which masks the\nindividual mirror segments as well as the telescope primary\nand secondary gives improved suppression performance com-\npared to a Lyot mask which only masks the telescope pri-\nmary and secondary. The individual segments in NAOMI\nare 7.6mm across with a \u223c0.1mm gap between each one.\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n10\u22121\n100\n101\n102\n103\n104\n105\n106\n107\nDistance from PSF centre (arcseconds)\nIn\nte\nns\nity\n (lo\ng s\nca\nle)\nradial average (standard Lyot mask)\nradial average (grid Lyot mask)\nline along 45\u00b0 (standard Lyot)\nline along 45\u00b0 (grid Lyot)\nFigure 8. Plot showing the benefit of using a grid-type Lyot\nmask matched to the NAOMI segment pattern compared to a\nstandard Lyot mask (primary and secondary masking only) - the\nintensity has been scaled to the same throughput for both masks.\nSimulations used a 1024 pixel aperture diameter padded to 2048\nfor the FFT, 8 segments across the aperture with a 2 pixel gap\nwidth. A 2 arcsec solid disc was used as the occulting mask.\nThe ratio of gap to segment size is the same order of mag-\nnitude to those proposed for future segmented extremely\nlarge telescopes (ELTs), i.e. 1m segments with 10mm gaps.\nHence these results have relevance for high contrast imag-\ning with ELTs. To model the effect of the gaps between\nthe NAOMI segments more pixels are required across the\naperture. The results shown in Fig. 8 were obtained using\n1024 pixels across the aperture diameter with a 2 pixel gap\nbetween the mirror segments. Due to the size of this ar-\nray this was a static simulation (i.e. not an AO simulation),\na 2 times padding factor was used in the FFTs. The lines\nshow the mean trends (a convolution filter has been applied\nto flatten out the high frequency periodicity) that the seg-\nmented aperture produces. In the high contrast direction\n(45\u25e6 to image axes) the benefit is most evident at distance\n> 5 arcsec from the centre, reducing counts by 2 orders of\nmagnitude. For the radial averaged lines (which include the\nbright axial diffraction peaks) the benefit of the grid Lyot\nmask is noticeable from 1 arcsec.\nFor the full AO simulations (with 256 pixels across the\naperture, 4\u00d7 padding and no gaps), the effect of phase mis-\nmatching between the segments can be seen as an over-\nintensity about the segments in the pupil plane subsequent\nto the application of the occulting mask, as shown in Fig.\n9(d). Segments with the greatest intensity are those that\nare \u2018turned off\u2019 and so have the greatest phase step between\nthem and adjacent segments. Taking gaps and phase errors\nbetween segments into consideration the benefit of a Lyot\nmask which masks the individual mirror segments becomes\napparent.\nA Lyot mask matched to the NAOMI mirror segments\n(80% under sizing of segments) was created with OSCA\n(shown in Fig. 2 (inset top, left-hand mask)) but is as yet\nuntested on-sky. The mask requires very careful alignment\nand there has been insufficient commissioning time to trial\n6 S. J. Thompson, A. P. Doel et al.\nFigure 9.

The simulation matches\nthe mid-point of the segments in piston and so the corners are also at higher intensity due to phase errors.\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120\n102\n103\n104\n105\n106\n107\n108\nPixels\nSc\nal\ned\n C\nCD\n c\nou\nnt\ns \n   \nGaussian mask A\n1.0 arcsec mask (thick chromium layer)\n0.5 arcsec mask (same ND level as Gaussian peak)\nFigure 10.

A simple iris was used\nfor the entrance aperture and another one at 80% diameter\nto act as the Lyot mask. Images were recorded at the final\nfocus for a variety of different occulting spots using a Santa\nBarbara Instrument Group (SBIG) camera, this consists of\na 375\u00d7242 pixel, Peltier-cooled CCD. The usual calibrations\nwere taken - dark frames and background images between\nevery image.\nThese tests were performed after OSCA had been\nshipped to the WHT. The Gaussian masks were commis-\nsioned at a later date and a method to compare them to\nthe standard masks on OSCA was devised. The lithogra-\nphy template plate was used in place of a 0.5 arcsec disc\nocculting mask, approximately the same as the full-width\nhalf-maximum of the Gaussian masks. The ND value of this\nmask was also closely matched to the max ND level at the\npeak of the Gaussian mask so offered a good comparison\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120\n103\n104\n105\n106\n107\n108\n109\n1010\nPixels\nSc\nal\ned\n C\nCD\n c\nou\nnt\ns\nno mask, no Lyot stop\nno mask, Lyot stop\nGaus A, Lyot stop\nGaus A, no Lyot stop\nFigure 11. Radially averaged line profiles taken about the peak\ncount, for different coronagraph configurations with the Gaussian\nfocal mask.\nbetween the two different shapes of mask. The 1.0 arcsec\nmask tested here was a spare from OSCA and had an ND\nlevel of \u223c5.5 (compared to \u223c2.5 for the 0.5 arcsec mask and\nGaussian) at this wavelength.\nImages were taken at the focus for all 3 different oc-\nculting masks, both with and without the Lyot mask. The\nimages were reduced (dark and background subtracted and\nscaled for exposure differences) and then radial averages\nwere plotted about the PSF peak. Fig. 10 shows the ra-\ndial averages of the 3 different masks using the same Lyot\nmask. The 1.0 arcsec mask performs best of all, entirely due\nto its much larger size (covers 4\u00d7 the area thus removing\nmuch more of the PSF) and greater opacity. Comparing the\nother two masks which differ mainly in their shape rather\nthan any other factors it can be seen that as the simula-\ntions predicted, the Gaussian shaped mask provides greater\nsuppression closer in to the centre than the disc mask does.\nFig. 11 shows the significant effect adding a Lyot stop\nhas on the suppression with the Gaussian mask, the CCD\ncount at 10 pixels from the centre is 5 \u00d7 103, compared to\n1.2 \u00d7 104 for the 0.50 arcsec disc. Without a Lyot stop the\nvalue at 10 pixels from the centre for the Gaussian mask is\n8\u00d7 104 and for the 0.50 arcsec disc is 5.5\u00d7 104. This shows\nthat for a Gaussian mask at the focus compared to a solid\ndisc of comparable size, an undersized pupil stop further\nResults from the AO coronagraph at the WHT 7\n10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\nPixels\nLy\not\n fa\nct\nor\nGaus A no Lyot \/ with Lyot\n0.53\" disk no Lyot \/ with Lyot\nFigure 12.

The x-axis starts just out-\nside the edge of the 0.50 arcsec disc mask.\nalong the beam works to greater advantage in suppressing\nthe final image. In terms of attenuation factors, the effect\nof adding the Lyot stop (measured at 10 pixels) with the\nGaussian mask compared to no Lyot stop brings about a\nfactor of 16 drop in measured CCD counts, for the 0.50 arc-\nsec disc this factor is only 4.6. At 60 pixels, for the Gaussian\nthe factor is 1.83 and for the 0.50 arcsec disc 1.75, approx-\nimately the same. The extra effectiveness of the Lyot stop\nwith the Gaussian mask is therefore greatest close in to the\nmask, with the \u2018Lyot factor\u2019 dropping as the distance from\nthe mask increases until it converges with the 0.50 arcsec\nmask values. This trend is shown in Fig. 12.\n5 COMMISSIONING RESULTS\nOSCA and its electronics were shipped to La Palma at the\nbeginning of May 2002 and it underwent first commissioning\nsoon after. Only two nights on-sky were allocated for the\nOSCA commissioning so time was very limited. The first\nnight was plagued by extremely bad seeing throughout (5\narcsec recorded at worst) and the AO system could not be\nused. Since the largest occulting mask in OSCA is 2.0 arcsec\nit was also not feasible to do any performance testing.\nThe last night (24th May) saw very variable seeing over\nthe course of the night and sky-location and the presence of\nhigh cirrus cloud also caused problems on occasion. NAOMI\nwas used although centring objects on the OSCA occulting\nmasks was difficult when the seeing was bad and OSCA per-\nformance was degraded. The average seeing was 1.5 arcsec,\nand with the AO system an average corrected PSF width\nof 0.5 arcsec was obtained. Fig. 13 shows the suppression\nobtained using OSCA in H-band using the 2.0 arcsec mask\nduring these conditions. From the graph it can be seen that\njust outside the edge of the occulting mask the photon count\nhas been reduced by a factor of 3.5. These values have al-\nready been adjusted to account for the loss in throughput\ndue to the Lyot mask.\nAttempts were made to observe science targets during\nthe course of the night. The objects were chosen based on\ntheir need for coronagraphic observations, i.e. features that\nwould not otherwise be easily observable and would demon-\nFigure 13. Cross-sections taken in the high-contrast (45\u25e6) direc-\ntion from H-band images (a) without OSCA (solid line) and (b)\nwith 2.0 arcsec mask (dashed line). The peak at zero is due to the\nOSCA mask having a small throughput. The jagged drop to zero\n(< 25 pixels) with no coronagraph is due to detector saturation.\nThe INGRID pixel scale is 0.04 arcsec\/pixel.\nFigure 14.

They also had to\nhave a V-band magnitude of less than 12 (i.e. brighter) due\nto the sensitivity of the NAOMI wavefront sensor and be ob-\nservable during the night at an altitude greater than z = 40\u25e6;\nbelow this the turbulence is generally higher due to the high\nair-mass. Additionally two possible subtraction stars were\nfound for each target. These were selected to be as close to\nthe target in all respects \u2013 sky position, colour\/spectral type\nand V magnitude. The attempt was to try and select single\nstars (no known companions) with a 10 arcsec field about\nthem that is free of any other (particularly bright) stars.\nFinding good subtraction stars is difficult as there are no\ncomprehensive catalogues for this and information can be\nincomplete or incorrect in the ones that are available, the\nones discussed here were chosen with the aid of the SIM-\nBAD database.\nThe reduced data for one of the commissioning targets \u2013\nHD150451AB \u2013 revealed a faint detection (see Fig. 14) of the\nrecently identified cool white dwarf companion HD150451C\n(Carson 2005). At the time a potential brown dwarf compan-\nion was suspected. Since no field rotations were performed\nto confirm this was not an AO artefact and the signal to\n8 S. J. Thompson, A. P.

Atmo-\nspheric seeing conditions were average (0.7 arcsec in V) and each\nof the images used in the subtraction had an integration time of\n30 seconds. All images are scaled to same level.\nnoise for the dwarf was extremely low, no specific conclu-\nsions could be made as of May 2002. The data collected\nover 2 years by Carson (2005) has confirmed this to be a\ncompanion to HD150451AB, and although initial data sug-\ngested the companion to be a methane brown dwarf, recent\nspectroscopic measurements favour a cool white dwarf clas-\nsification.\nSky frames were taken for all data (every 10 minutes in\nK and every 15 minutes in J) to allow more accurate back-\nground subtractions. Two different PSF subtraction stars\nwere observed for each target, although with much longer\nintervals than is ideal due to time constraints. It became ap-\nparent that the PSF stability was poor so that subtractions\nacross timescales greater than 5 minutes were contaminated\nwith many AO residuals. Fig. 15 shows this PSF change over\ntime, taken from J-band images of HD141569.\nDue to the limited time, nothing of interest was un-\ncovered in data taken on MWC297. However the PSF star\nchosen for MWC297 revealed a group of 4 stars in close prox-\nimity (see Fig. 16(a)), with the closest being 1.6 arcseconds\nfrom the central PSF star. No off-mask images were taken\nfor this object since it was originally only to be used as a PSF\nsubtraction star, so only rough estimates of theK-magnitude\nwere possible. The occulted profile was compared to that of\nan un-masked IR standard star and scaled so that the wings\nclosely matched. This scale factor (corrected for integration\ntime) was then used directly with the IR standard star mag-\nnitude and applied to the usual magnitude-flux relation to\nobtain a value of 8.9. The K-magnitude estimate for the clos-\nest star is 12.2\u00b1 0.3 \u2013 a value for the flux contribution from\nthe central star has been subtracted and was estimated by\nplotting radial averages about the star. The central star and\nthe outermost two stars in this image are listed in the lat-\nest Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) catalogue of point\nsources. This lists BD-04 4476 as having a K magnitude of\n8.5 and the outer two stars 12.6 and 11.3 respectively. Tak-\ning into account the estimates involved with the focal stop\nand that 2MASS cannot resolve the inner two stars, our\nmeasurements appear to be reasonable.\nAn upgrade to OSCA was carried out in April 2003. The\nGaussian occulting masks were installed along with a razor\nedged anti-scatter mask in front of the focal plane substrates\n(to reduce scattering from the edges of substrates on which\nthe occulting spots are deposited). The whole of OSCA was\nalso moved and installed at GRACE (a new, environment\ncontrolled laboratory on one of the Nasmyth platforms on\nthe WHT). This should alleviate previous problems of dust\ncontamination and temperature problems for NAOMI.\nFigure 16. Ks-band image of BD-04 4476 (SAO 142339). (a)\nThere are 4 stars about the central (occulted) star at distances\nof 1.59, 2.72, 8.26 and 9.67 arcseconds. (b) 2MASS image of the\nsame region. The two stars marked with crosses are the outermost\nstars in the OSCA image.\n6 CONCLUSIONS\nOSCA is a high precision stellar coronagraph, produced on a\nlow budget, over a short timescale and meeting all the design\nspecifications. However, due to the limited time assigned for\nthe commissioning and the overlap with NAOMI engineer-\ning schedules, a complete and thorough testing of OSCA\nhas not been possible and as a result there have been no\nperformance tests done with OSCA in optimum seeing con-\nditions and optimum alignment (both of OSCA and other\ninstrumentation).\nThe mechanics and electronics of OSCA have operated\nconsistently to date and succeed in maintaining the required\npositioning and alignment, including that for the Lyot stop\nrotation. The deployment mechanism for OSCA has proven\nto be very successful; it allows OSCA to be raised in to (and\nout of) the beam very quickly and with consistently accu-\nrate positioning, allowing for a flexible and varied observing\nprogram over the course of a night.\nSimulations of the NAOMI and OSCA system also have\nrelevance for the next generation of extremely large tele-\nscopes where high contrast imaging is essential in the search\nfor extra-solar planets. When designing a coronagraphic sys-\ntem for a highly segmented aperture suitable masking in the\nLyot (pupil) plane must be devised to counteract the strong\ndiffraction pattern that will result otherwise - reducing sup-\npression performance and confusing the data.\nA number of interesting astronomy targets have been\nobserved during the OSCA commissioning runs. The most\npositive results were the very faint detection of the cool\nwhite dwarf in HD150451 and the discovery of a potential\ncompanion (\u223c 150AU) in BD-04 4476. More data is required\nto draw any firm conclusions on the nature of these objects.\nInformation regarding the current status of OSCA and\ninstructions for observing with the system can be found on\nthe ING website.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nIn memory of Richard Bingham, who passed away during\nthe publication of this paper.
