Scholars have found\nevidence of a positive correlation between level of education and\nmilitancy both among Islamic and left-wing radicals.4 Almost noth-\ning is known, however, about the link between different types of\neducation and radicalization generally. Yet, there are good grounds,\nand some evidence that we discuss below, to expect that certain\npolitical and ideological orientations could be either promoted or\nselected by the discipline one chooses to study.\nMuch of the literature on extremism claims that there is no clear\n\u2018\u2018terrorist profile\u2019\u2019: radical Islamists have few individual traits in\ncommon (Nesser 2004; Sageman 2004; on profiling failures cf.\nCapoccia, forthcoming). Yet, it appears improbable that anyone can\nbecome radicalized if only the circumstances are right. Individual\nchoices based on cognitive and personality traits are likely to play\na role at least at the point when broader ideological networks get pared\ndown and radicalized. Such traits tend to be very hard to observe\nwhen it comes to militants, certainly on a statistically relevant scale.\nThe choice of education is one of the few micro-level features on\nwhich we have reasonably reliable data, which could betray underlying\nindividual traits.\nThis is the rationale of the present article. Its first part will examine\na wide range of evidence to establish the size of the engineers\u2019\npresence among Islamic radicals, both in the Muslim and in the\nWestern world; in addition, we consider their presence in two control\ngroups, non-violent Islamic groups as well as non-Islamic extremist\ngroups. In the second part, we try to make sense of the pattern of\nfindings, testing both environmental and individual-level explanations\nfor the distribution of degrees among Islamist radicals.\n1. Islamic extremists in Muslin countries\nTo test whether engineers are really over-represented, we compiled\na list of 404 members of violent Islamist groups in the Muslim world\ndrawing from a variety of sources (Table 1). In the sample there are\n3 Abuza 2006; Bergen and Pandey 2006;\nSageman 2004, p. 76; Schulze 1990, n. 22;\nWaltz 1986.\n4 Russell and Miller 1977; Krueger\nand Maleckova 2003; Krueger 2007;\nBerrebi 2003; Ricolfi 2005.\n2\ndiego gambetta and steffen hertog\nindividuals from 30 nationalities, 9 larger groups and no less than\na dozen smaller groups. This set does not fully represent what is\na varied universe of unknown size, but is large and disparate enough to\nallow us to establish whether the puzzle holds true.\nt a b l e i\nSample sources\nDescription Source N\nInternational jihadis involved\nin 1993 World Trade Center\nattack, 1998 bombing of\nUS embassies in Africa,\n2002 Bali bombings, and\nSeptember 11\nProvided by Peter\nBergen and Swati\nPandey, complemented\nby library and\ninternet research\n75\nInternational salafi jihadis Sageman (2004),\ncombined with\nlibrary and\ninternet research\n126\nHamas (Palestine) Hamas websites,\nRangwala (2005);\nSmith et al.

(2003)\n39\nTotal 404\n3\nviolence in politics: the case of the engineers\nEducation levels\nWe searched wherever we could for information on each of the 404\nindividuals in our sample, and found some biographical information\nfor 326 cases and educational information for 284. Out of these, 196\nhad higher education, whether finished or unfinished (at least 37\nstudied in Western countries), whose median date of birth is 1968.\nThe share of individuals with higher education appears impressive:\n69.0 %. This is much higher than the tertiary enrolment rates in the\nvarious countries of origin (12.2 % in the Arab world in the 1980s;\nLonguenesse 1990, p. 329). Only in the South East Asian groups the\nlevel of education lower was than in the rest of the sample.\nEducation types\nWe were able to find the subject of study for 178 of the 196 cases\nwho were engaged in higher education at some point (Figure 1).\nUnsurprisingly, we found that the second most numerous group was\ncomposed of 34 individuals who pursued Islamic studies. Yet, the\ngroup that comes first by far are indeed the engineers: 78 out of 178\nindividuals had studied this subject. This means that 44 % of those\nwhose type of degree we know were engineers. On the whole, the\nindividuals who studied for what we may call \u2018\u2018elite degrees\u2019\u2019 \u2013 engineering,\nf i g . i\nHigher education in our sample (196 cases)\n78\n7\n34\n14 12\n5\n28\n18\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\nEn\ngin\nee\nrin\ng\nSc\nien\nces\nIsla\nmi\nc s\ntud\nies\nMe\ndic\nine\nBu\nsin\nes\ns\/e\ncon\nom\nics\nEd\nuc\nati\non\nOth\ner\nSu\nbje\nct u\nnk\now\nn\n4\ndiego gambetta and steffen hertog\nmedicine, and science, generally the most selective programs in the\nIslamic world \u2013 represent 56.7 %.\nOur sample could be biased. For instance, lower-level operatives in\ncertain groups are less likely to be reported, and these might have\ngenerally lower levels of education. Yet, there is no reason to expect\na systematic reporting bias regarding the type of education.\nA further finding gives us confidence in the robustness of our\nresult: the predominance of engineers is not clustered in any one of the\nsample groups, but spread evenly across them. The same obtains if we\nre-arrange the data by the subjects\u2019 nationality \u2013 with the exception of\nSaudi Arabians which we discuss below.\nHow much over-represented are they?\nWe estimate that the average share of engineers among the total male\nworking population in the countries of our sample, weighted by the\nnumber of cases per country, is about 3.5%.5 If we leave out Singapore,\na country with an extraordinarily high number of engineers, the share\nis 2.1 %. By contrast, even if we include all missing values in the\ndenominator, engineers are still about 19 % of our total sample (78\/404),\nnine times greater than a null hypothesis would predict.\nBut how do engineers compare to other graduates? To address this\nquestion we must compare our results with (male) enrolment rates in\ndifferent subjects. We found this data for twelve countries covering\n169 of the 196 relevant cases with higher education. The over-\nrepresentation of engineers in our sample is present for all these\nnationalities except Saudi Arabia (see below). The average share of\nengineers among total male students weighted by the number of cases\nwith higher education per nationality in our sample is 18.0 %, while\nthe ratio of engineers over those with known higher education in our\nsample is 43.8 %. The odds of being an engineer in our sample are\nthree and a half times greater (significant at p,.001).\nThe Saudi exception\nWhen looking at the nationality of the individuals in our sample,\none peculiarity worth noting emerges: scattered across several of our\ngroups there is a contingent of 25 Saudis, 11 of whom have higher\n5 This is based on labor market data from\nLonguenesse (1990, p. 328) as well as\nUNESCO education data (2005).\n5\nviolence in politics: the case of the engineers\neducation, with the subject known for 9 cases. Only one of them is an\nengineer. This gains significance when we consider another sample of\nSaudi Islamic insurgents collected by Thomas Hegghammer (2006).\nOut of a \u2018\u2018core\u2019\u2019 of 70 violent Islamists active in the recent domestic\ninsurgency in Saudi Arabia, he found educational data on 36, 17 of\nwhom had college exposure. Among the 11 of these for whom the\nsubject is known, five pursued religious degrees but again only one\nwas an engineer. Combining the data, we find only 2 engineers among\n20 cases with known higher education. Finally, among the 25 in-\ndividuals involved in 9\/11, there were fifteen Saudis and eight\nengineers. A full seven of the ten non-Saudis were engineers, but\nonly one Saudi was. What are we to make of this exception? We will\nreturn to this later.\n2. Islamic extremists in Western countries\nBefore attempting to explain what\u2019s \u2018\u2018wrong\u2019\u2019 with engineers, we\nmust consider whether they are overrepresented also among a different\ngroup of violent Islamic extremists, namely those born in or residents\nof Western countries who became active in recent times, mostly after\n9\/11. For this purpose we assembled 265 names of Islamic extremists\nwho are citizens or residents of a western country, and have come to\nwestern authorities\u2019 attention for carrying out or plotting a terrorist\nattack in the West.6 Altogether 36 plots are covered.\nThe sample is close to the universe of violent Islamic extremists\ncaught in the West up until the end of 2006. Out of 265 individuals,\n259 are residents (many of them citizens) of 13 western countries.\nWe searched for biographical information on the names in our list\nin a variety of public sources. Despite the fact that most of these\nindividuals were caught, tried or died in the West under intense media\nscrutiny, we found information on the education of only 54 cases and\ninformation on the occupation of 38 additional cases.\nAmong the 54 for whom we found educational information, 21 had\nsecondary education, while 33 had either some university exposure\n(20) or a university degree (13). We found information on the type of\ndegree pursued by 22 out of those 33 (Table 2): nearly all are from the\nabove-mentioned \u2018\u2018elite degrees\u2019\u2019 and engineers alone represent 59.1 %.\n6 The bulk of individuals, 229, come from\nBakker who has assembled a comprehensive\nlist of European jihadists (Bakker 2006,\np. 59 sq.).\n6\ndiego gambetta and steffen hertog\nEven if the overall number of graduates we identified were lower than\nthe real number of graduates in the sample, there is no reason to\nbelieve that the distribution by degree should be significantly biased.\nIn addition, the 33 individuals with known university exposure are\nspread over 14 of the 36 acts or plots in the sample.\nWhile the engineering overrepresentation survives in the western\nsample and appears even stronger, the proportion of graduates is\nlower: in the sample of 404 non-Western jihadists, the share of those\nwith higher education even if we include missing cases is no less than\n48.5 %, while in the western sample the corresponding proportion is\n12.5 % (33\/265), despite much higher tertiary enrolment rates in\nWestern countries. As the missing cases in the Western sample are\nspread evenly across groups, we suspect that non-reporting of higher\neducation indicates absence thereof \u2013 for why should it be reported\nfor some individuals in the same group, but not others? The criminal\nbackground of around 20 % of cases and the fact that the 38 in-\ndividuals on which we found occupational data all held non-professional\njobs, also lead us to conclude that levels of education are much\nlower.\nIn conclusion, the evidence suggests that compared to the cases in\nour Muslim world sample, the Western based jihadists have attracted\nfar fewer graduates and fewer qualified individuals and many more\nfrom a lower class and lower middle class background. Yet, despite\nthis apparent \u2018\u2018lumpen\u2019\u2019 status of Islamic extremists in the West, we\nfind among them proportionally even more engineers than in the first\nsample.\nt a b l e i i\nType of university degree, complete or incomplete\nType of degree N %\nEngineering 13 59.1\nNatural sciences 4 18.2\nEconomics, business, accountancy 3 13.6\nSports science 1 4.5\nSocial work 1 4.5\nTotal known 22 100\nUnknown 11 \u2013\nTotal 33 \u2013\n7\nviolence in politics: the case of the engineers\n3. Non violent Islamists\nThe individuals in the samples considered so far include only\nmembers of violent groups, but what about non-violent Islamic move-\nments? One thing we know for certain is that Islamic parties and\nmovements usually contain a fair share of highly educated individu-\nals.7 With respect to the distribution of subjects there are both\nsimilarities and differences relative to the sample of violent Islamic\ngroups in the Muslim world.\nWe managed to collect data on a variety of non-violent groups in eight\nof the Islamic countries in our sample (see Table 3). They show a striking\ndifference from our samples of violent groups: in non-violent Islamic\nactivism engineers, although strongly present, appear to be far less domi-\nnant. They are joined by a strong, often stronger contingent of other\nelite degrees (OEDs) such as medicine, pharmacology and science.\nIf we consider that OEDs constitute only around 10 % of the total\nmale student body in the Egyptian and Jordanian cases, i.e. equal or\nless than engineers, OEDs appear to be clearly overrepresented among\nnon-violent groups, and at least as strongly represented as engineers.\nBy contrast, in our main sample there are only 23 OED cases and\n78 engineers. While Islamist radicalization seems to appeal to both\nengineers and other elite students, engineers seem more prone to end\nup in violent groups (Table 4).\n4. Non-Islamic extremists\nCould this mean that engineers are more prone to militant extremism\nin general? To test for this we carried out a survey of literature and\nseveral primary sources on an assortment of violent groups outside of\nthe Islamic world (see Table 5). Although far from exhaustive, the\ngathered information covers a large set that reveals clear patterns.\nFirst, we failed to find engineers among left-wing extremists active\nafter World War II, despite their generally high levels of education:\nleft-wingers of the RAF, the Japanese Red Army, the Italian Red\nBrigades, and Latin American urban guerrilla groups included almost\nno engineers, but were rather dominated by law and humanities\n7 Best 1999; Hoffman 1995; Lobmeyer\n1995; Moore 1994; Munson 1986;\nWickham 2002.\n8\ndiego gambetta and steffen hertog\nstudents. Anarchists with 6 engineers among cases with a known\ndegree (compared to 20 lawyers) are only a partial exception.\nBy contrast, among right-wing extremists, who generally had much\nlower levels of education, engineers if not over-represented are at least\nclearly present. Among 287 right-wing extremists and neo-Nazis in\nGermany and Austria involved in 33 groups, we found 29 individuals\nwith known higher education 6 of whom were engineers. In the US\nextreme right, whose ideology often has a strong religious and\nmillenarian underpinning (Handler 1990) and whose members are\ngenerally poorly educated, engineers have played a significant role as\nt a b l e i i i\nDegree distribution in non-violent Islamist groups\nCountry Groups Engineers\nOther elite\nsubjects* Total\nEgypt Muslim Brotherhood\nMPs\n18 12 88\nKuwait Islamist MPs 1 2 18\nJordan Islamic Action\nFront founders\n22 42 353\nSyria Hizb ut-Tahrir\nprisoners\n10 17 59\nSaudi Arabia Islamist dissidents 0 3 5\nMorocco PJD MPs 3 9 42\nIndonesia Various parties 5 2 16\nMalaysia PAS, ABIM 0 1 4\nTotal 59 88 585\nSources: Azam 1997, Middle East newspapers, party, movement and parliamentary\nwebsites, personal communication with Stephane Lacroix and Joshua Stacher.\n*This includes medicine, pharmacology and basic sciences.\nt a b l e i v\nPercentages of engineers and oeds in violent and non-violent groups\n% Engineers % OEDs Total (N)\nNon-violent 40.1 59.9 100 (147)\nViolent 77.2 22.8 100 (101)\n9\nviolence in politics: the case of the engineers\nt a b l e v\nGraduates and engineers in non-islamic radical groups\nAnarchists Our search in the biographies of 700\ninternational anarchists \u2013 covering\n19th and 20th century individuals and\nmost European countries, the US,\nRussia and several Asian countries \u2013\nyielded 54 cases with a known degree,\nsix of whom were engineers, 10 doctors,\n20 lawyers, and 15 philosophers*.\nPost WWII\nLeft-wing extremists\nMost 1970s German left-wing terrorists\nstudied humanities (J\u20acager et al. 1981;\nvon Baeyer-Katte et al. 1983).\nNo engineer among 17 members of the\nRote Armee Fraktion cases with known\nhigher education (www.rafinfo.de).\nIn a sample of 67 members of the Italian\nRed Brigades and other radical leftist\nItalian groups, which is part of\na database under construction by\nValeria Pizzini-Gambetta, out of 34\nknown education achievements, 16 had\neither a university degree (6) or some\nuniversity exposure (10); of those,\n10 were in the arts, humanities or social\nsciences, 3 in natural sciences, 1 in\nmaths, 1 in physics and 1 in\nengineering.\nMost radical US leftists were doctors,\nlawyers or had a liberal arts education\n(Smith and Morgan 1994).\nLatin American left-wing radicals in late\n1960s were mostly graduates of law,\nhumanities, and medicine (Russell and\nHildner 1971).\n10\ndiego gambetta and steffen hertog\nTable v (Continued)\nMembers of the Japanese Red Army were\nmostly university students or graduates\nand mostly from liberal arts fields, with\nonly very few medical doctors or\nstudents and one physicist (Patricia\nSteinhoff, personal communication).\nNo example of engineers found anywhere\noutside of Islamic world (Russell and\nHildner 1971; Smith and Morgan 1994;\nJ\u20acager et al. 1981; von Bayer-Katte et al.\n1983; authors\u2019 survey of numerous\nwebsites).\nPost WWII\nRight-wing\nextremists\nA survey of three German right-wing\nparties yields a presence of some\nengineers, but no over-representation\ncompared to the share of engineers\namong German graduates (federal and\nstate-level websites of\nNationaldemokratische Partei\nDeutschlands, Republikaner and\nDeutsche Volksunion).\nAmong 287 right-wing extremists and\nneo-Nazis in Germany and Austria, we\nfound 29 individuals with known higher\neducation, involved in 33 groups, 6 of\nwhom were engineers.\nAmong seven educated leaders of\nUS extreme right-wing groups whose\ndegree or occupation we could establish,\nthree were educated as engineers and\nanother one worked in the electronics\nindustry (Smith and Morgan 1994; web\nsurveys).\n*Survey of biographies on ,http:\/\/ytak.club.fr\/index.html..\n11\nviolence in politics: the case of the engineers\nleaders of several groups: out of seven individuals for whom we were\nable to establish the degree, four were engineers. With generally fewer\ngraduates around, however, right-wing engineers do not stand out as\nstrikingly as Islamic radical engineers.\nAs a final step to delimit the phenomenon, we need to ask a narrower\nquestion to control not for ideology but for country conditions: do\nengineers have a propensity to become radicalized not in general but in\nIslamic countries in particular? There is some evidence that local\ncontext could explain their radicalization.\nIn their survey of 350 individuals members of eighteen groups of\nurban left-wing revolutionaries in ten countries around the world\nRussell and Miller (1977) found that engineers were never a significant\npresence with two striking exceptions: Iranian and Turkish groups\nhad a high proportion of engineers, and Iran and Turkey were the only\nIslamic countries in their survey.8 At a time when left-wing groups\nwere considered, by revolutionarily inclined youth worldwide, as the\nbest means to change the world, radical engineers seem to have been\nprominent in them in the Islamic world too.\nOur own search in the biographies of 205 non-Islamist Palestinian\nmilitants seems to corroborate this finding.9 At least 101 of the 205\nhad higher education; among the 93 cases in which the subject is\nreported, we found 16 doctors, 14 trained in economics or business-\nrelated subjects, 10 lawyers and 10 engineers. So, unlike in left-wing\ngroups outside of the Islamic world, engineers are present among\nnon-Islamic Palestinian groups, though they are not over-represented\n(cf. also Russell and Miller 1977, p. 28).\n5. Summary of findings\nThe puzzle from which we started appears confirmed: the number\nof militant engineers relative to the total population of engineers is\nminiscule \u2013 yet engineers, relative to other graduates, are overrepre-\nsented among violent Islamic radicals by three to four times the size\nwe would expect.\nWhile the overrepresentation of university-educated individuals\namong Islamic extremists varies by country, group and sample, the\n8 For further references on engineers\nin radical Iranian leftist movements cf.\nChehabi 1990, p. 89; Abrahamian 1989,\npp. 229 sq.).\n9 Taken from Glen Rangwala\u2019s compilation\nof biographies; http:\/\/middleeastreference.\norg.uk\/palbiograph.html (accessed October\n2006).\n12\ndiego gambetta and steffen hertog\nengineering overrepresentation seems insensitive to all three varia-\ntions \u2013 with the one exception of Saudi Arabia.\nAmong non-Islamic extremists, we find virtually no engineers in\nthe violent left-wing \u2013 in Europe, US, Japan and Latin America \u2013 even\nin those groups in which highly educated individuals are predomi-\nnant. Only in some Middle Eastern countries has there been a signif-\nicant presence of engineers among left-wing radicals. On the extreme\nright of the political spectrum, by contrast, while not overrepresented,\nengineers are present in groups of various kinds all over the world.\nIn the rest of this paper, we shall not try to explain why certain\nengineers rather than others became radicalized. Our goal is more\nmodest: we will try to explain only why engineers became more\nradicalized than individuals with other degrees.\nWe will first argue that two plausible hypotheses \u2013 network-based\nexpansion of groups and the selection of engineers because of their\ntechnical skills \u2013 do not survive close scrutiny. Next we will present\nevidence supporting two other hypotheses \u2013 engineers\u2019 peculiar cognitive\ntraits and dispositions, and the special social difficulties faced by\nengineers in Islamic countries. Our argument is that the pattern of results\ncan be best explained by the interaction between these two forces.\n6. Hypotheses: network diffusion\nIllegal groups are set up in a clandestine fashion and their existence is\nadvertised along networks of pre-existing social bonds.

Sageman 2004). A combination of historical accident and network-\nbased diffusion could explain the engineers\u2019 over-representation.\nHowever, the more we find engineers to be over-represented in\ndifferent countries and different networks the less likely it is that their\npresence is due to a historical contingency. Even in the most restrictive\ninterpretation, our main sample of jihadists contains four clusters \u2013\nNorth Africans, South East Asians, Palestinians and international\nArabs jihadists \u2013 which grew independently of each other, and\nengineers are strongly present in all of them. We also find that engineers\nare overrepresented among the Western based extremists, scattered\nover several unconnected groups.\nMoreover, in broad-based movements such as Hamas, network ef-\nfects should become less important with the growing scale of mobili-\nzation. None of this implies that the size of the engineering contingent\nwithin each independent cluster is unaffected by network effects \u2013 it\nvery probably is. What we cannot explain by network effects are both\nthe disproportionate share of engineers who became prime movers\nand their greater willingness to stay in or join a radical network even\nif started by non-engineers.\n7. Selection based on technical skills\nWhat about the most obvious hypothesis: recruitment based on\ntechnical skills? Technical knowledge can help in creating and\nhandling the tools of violence as well as in maintaining clandestine\ncommunications.\nDeliberate recruitment for technical tasks probably occurs with\nrespect to the internal allocation of tasks for specific operations \u2013 three\nof the four 9\/11 pilots for example were engineers. However, several\nfacts suggest that this explanation does not really work for recruitment\nin general.\nFirst, we have found no evidence at all of recruits being selected\nby technical skills. Personal trust seems a more important criterion\nin the formation of, for example, al-Qaeda cells (Sageman 2004,\np. 92). Bomb-making is usually performed by a few specialists, which\nwould leave the high share of engineers among many organizations\n14\ndiego gambetta and steffen hertog\nunexplained. That engineers are mainly sought for their ability to fill\ntechnical roles is also refuted by the case of Hamas where many\nengineers serve in senior management positions with no technical\nfunction (while many Hamas suicide bombers pursued religious\ndegrees, Pedahzur 2005).\nNext, the technology involved in most violent attacks has been\nrelatively simple and did not require great expertise. It is much harder\nto obtain good quality explosives than put them to use. Lastly, it is\ndoubtful that violent movements with a larger share of engineers have\nmustered a greater destructive power than groups without. Consider,\nfor instance, the Saudi insurgency, which mounted devastating bomb\nattacks in 2003 and 2004; or the LTTE in Sri Lanka, the IRA and\nETA separatist movements, whose members have come largely from\namong the poorly educated and the working class.\n8. The engineering \u2018\u2018mindset\u2019\u2019\nThe cross-cutting presence of engineers in militant groups, seem-\ningly indifferent to time, social and country variations, is arguably\na sign that individual-level traits must be part of the explanation.\nHaving discarded the technical skills hypothesis, it is difficult to\nimagine these traits as not being related to personality or mindset.\nRegardless of which personality traits exactly are at work \u2013 some-\nthing to which we shall return later \u2013 if the \u2018\u2018mindset\u2019\u2019 hypothesis ob-\ntains, a twofold prediction follows: first, we should find engineers to\nhave a greater predilection towards joining radical political groups regard-\nless of Islam. Our findings concerning non-Islamic extremists show\nthat, to some extent, this is the case, but with respect to right-wing\ngroups only. If their mindset explains this divide between right-wing\nand Islamist groups on the one hand, and left-wing groups on the\nother, this would imply that it sustains the pursuit of radical change\nonly if this is aimed at establishing a strong, hierarchical social order.\nSecond, engineers compared with people in other disciplines\nshould also manifest more radical views. This prediction too should\nbe verifiable independently of Islamism.\nEngineers\u2019 political and religious views\nWe searched for evidence to test the latter by trying to discover\nwhether there is anything unusual in engineers\u2019 political-ideological\n15\nviolence in politics: the case of the engineers\norientations. The best data we could find in this regard comes from\na survey of faculty members in undergraduate colleges and universi-\nties throughout the United States carried out in 1984 (Carnegie\nFoundation 1984).10 Of the 9,968 faculty sampled 5,057 (50.7 %)\nreturned completed mail questionnaires. We selected the males and\nlooked at their self-reported political and religious views according to\ntheir highest degree.\nThe results are startling (Table 7). The proportion of engineers who\ndeclare themselves to be on the right of the political spectrum is greater\nthan in any other disciplinary group: 57.6 % of them are either\nconservative or strongly conservative, as compared to 51.1 of econo-\nmists, 42.5 of doctors and 33.5 % of scientists, 21.4 % of those in the\nhumanities, and 18.6 % of the social scientists, the least right-wing of all\ndisciplinary groups. Only 1.4 % of engineers are on the left, as opposed\nto 12.9 % in the social sciences and 16.7 % in law. Perhaps this is an\nuncanny coincidence, but the four fields at the top of the conservatism\nscale \u2013 engineering, economics, medicine, and science \u2013 are the same\nfour secular fields we found at the top of our main jihadist sample.\nThis finding is not new. In an article in Science, Ladd and Lipset\n(1972) uncovered the same result using an earlier and much larger\nsurvey of the Carnegie Foundation on American academics carried out\nin 1969. \u2018\u2018No other variable, we have found\u2019\u2019, they concluded, \u2018\u2018dif-\nferentiates politically among American academics as effectively as\ntheir professional field\u2019\u2019 (ibid., p. 1091). This seems a strong indication\nthat choice of degree is a powerful proxy for ideological preferences.\nThe Carnegie survey reveals an even more surprising fact, hitherto\nunnoticed, that strengthens the suspicion that the engineers\u2019 mindset\nmay play a part in their proneness not only to radicalise to the right of the\npolitical spectrum, but do so with a religious slant: engineers turn out to\nbe by far the most religious group of all academics \u2013 66.5 %, followed\nagain by 61.7 % in economics, 49.9 % in sciences, 48.8 % of social\nscientists, 46.3 % of doctors and 44.1 % of lawyers. Engineers and\neconomists are also those who oppose religion least (3.7 % and 3.0 %,\nTable 8).\nThe gap between engineering and the other disciplines shows even\nmore clearly if we consider political and religious views jointly (Table 9,\n10 Unfortunately, there is a surprising\ndearth of data on type of degree in surveys\nthat include questions about political or re-\nligious orientations. In the many surveys\naround the world which we checked, the type\nof degree is not recorded; and in the very few\ncases in which it is, the number of graduates\nis either too small or the relevant opinions are\nnot recorded.\n16\ndiego gambetta and steffen hertog\nfirst column): nearly half of the engineers in the sample are both\nconservative and religious (46 %), followed by economists and, at quite\nsome distance, by doctors and scientists.\nWe also tested the effect of the various university degrees on the\nprobability of being both conservative and religious through a logistic\nregression, which allowed us to control for other variables (Table 10).\nIt turns out that the odds of being both religious and conservative rather\nthan anything else are seven times greater for engineers relative to the\nodds of a social scientist \u2013 far higher than those for any other subject.\nObjections\nThe sources of this extraordinary bias are a puzzle in their own\nright.

Three objections could be\nraised.\nOne could question whether this mindset is unique to academic\nengineers. The answer is likely to be negative: similar results are\nfound on the political and religious opinions of students, both for \u2018\u2018un-\nsocialised\u2019\u2019 beginners in the first four semesters and more advanced\nones. While the proportions are lower than among academics the\nranking is exactly the same, with engineers firmly at the top (see Table 9\nabove, columns 2 and 3, also Ladd and Lipset 1975, pp. 74-75).11\nStill, one could further object, the phenomenon could be uniquely\nAmerican. Some old evidence suggests that at least the right-wing bias\noccurs in the Middle East: a 1948 survey of 3890 Cairo University\nstudents recorded the highest sympathies for fascist ideology among\nengineering students (Botman 1984, p. 70).

The International\nSocial Survey Programme\u2019s 1998 survey was the only source we found\nto cover both. The ISSP has been producing a series of annual cross-\nnational opinion surveys on samples of the general population, in which\neach year is focused on a different social and political topic; 1998was the\nmost recent set to focus on religion and to include also information on\nthe position of respondents on the left-right political spectrum. As there\nwas no information on type of degree, we were forced, however, to use\nvarious engineering-related professions as a proxy for an engineering\neducation.12\nThe results from 2816 cases in 16 mostly Western countries show\nthat engineers were not more religious than other graduates and only\ninsignificantly to the right of them. However, the combination of the two\ncharacteristics occurred far more often among engineers than the null\nhypothesis of non-correlation would predict \u2013 the only professional\ncategory in which this happened. Whereas based on individual scores\non religiousness and right-wing attitudes we expected 9.4 % of en-\ngineers to share both attributes, 13.9 %, actually did (significant at\n0.05).

This is all we need to warrant our claim that on the margin,\nengineers differ in the crucial traits of religiosity and conservatism.\nLastly, while striking in general, in which way could this combined\nbias explain engineers\u2019 attraction to radical Islamism in particular? An\naffinity can be assumed between higher levels of religiousness and\nattraction by Islamist militancy, but what about right-wing attitudes?\nEngineers\u2019 more extreme political preferences may explain why we\nfind them among right-wing extremists and virtually never among\nleft-wing ones, but why should it help us to explain their attraction to\nIslamism?\nAn answer is that radical Islamists\u2019 Weltanschauung demonstrably\nshares several features with the worldviews found in the extreme\nright. One such feature is a corporatist and mechanistic view of the\nideal society.

The fear of social chaos undermining this established order\nis a leitmotif of Islamist thought (Hoffman 1995, pp. 218 sq.).\nUnlike left-wing extremism, which aims at broadening the lines of\npower and privilege, right-wing extremism aims to restore a lost, often\nmythical order of privileges and authority, and emerges as a backlash\nagainst displacement or status deprivation in a period of sharp social\nchange (Lipset and Raab 1971). In its underlying craving for a lost\norder, its match with the radical Islamic ideology is undeniable: the\ntheme of returning to the order of the prophet\u2019s early community is\nomnipresent in most salafist and jihadist texts.\nNature of the mindset\nWhat exactly about engineers\u2019 mindset or cognitive disposition could\nmake them a good match for this ideological cocktail? We can conjecture\nthat engineering as a degree might be relatively more attractive to indi-\nviduals seeking cognitive \u2018\u2018closure\u2019\u2019 and clear-cut answers as opposed to\nmore open-ended sciences \u2013 a disposition which has been empirically\nlinked to conservative political attitudes (Jost et al. 2003; Amodio et al.\n2007). Engineering is a subject in which individuals with a dislike for\nambiguity might feel comfortable. According to Nilufer G\u20acole, engi-\nneers in (peaceful) Islamist parties in Turkey claim to know the \u2018\u2018one\nbest way\u2019\u2019 of how to solve social problems through technical and\nlogical approaches, and despise the Kemalist elite of jurists who are\npreoccupied with debates on abstract ideas (G\u20acole 1990, pp. 172 sq.).\nOlivier Roy, aiming to explain why many Islamist intellectuals have\na scientific or technical education, points out that the sciences, in these\nwriters\u2019 simplistic perception, reflect the \u2018\u2018the coherence of the whole,\nthe rationality of the one [God]\u2019\u2019 (Roy 1990, p. 271; Hanafi 1997,\np. 148). By contrast, they refuse Western social sciences because these\ndisciplines challenge the unity and divine order of the world.\nThere is some evidence of recruitment being based precisely on\nindividual traits coherent with such dispositions. The \u2018\u2018constitution\u2019\u2019\nof al-Qaeda from the late 1980s says that members should ideally have\na college degree (Wright 2006, p. 42), and a training manual for jihadists\nmentions a series of specific traits that recruiters seek: \u2018\u2018discipline and\nobedience, patience, intelligence\u2019\u2019 (p. 18), \u2018\u2018caution and prudence\u2019\u2019 (p. 19),\n21\nviolence in politics: the case of the engineers\nand ability \u2018\u2018to observe and analyze\u2019\u2019 (p. 20).13 According to a British\nintelligence dossier (The Sunday Times, 10 July 2005), Islamic\nextremists are known to target schools and colleges where young people may be\nvery inquisitive but less challenging and more susceptible to extremist reasoning\/\narguments. (The Sunday Times, 10 July 2005, our emphasis)\nThe dossier\u2019s choice of adjectives is interesting: we can find people\nwho are inquisitive and challenging or supine and unchallenging, but\nthe combination of a sharp mind with a loyal acceptance of authority\nmay exist among accountants, but is unlikely to be common among\nthose ready to choose extreme paths. These traits that recruiters seek\ncould be more frequent, at least marginally, among engineers, and\nrecruiters themselves might be aware of this. The British intelligence\ndossier further states that\n\u2018\u2018a network of \u2018extremist recruiters\u2019 is circulating on campuses targeting people\nwith \u2018technical and professional qualifications\u2019, particularly engineering and IT\ndegrees.\u2019\u201914\nAbuza reports a similar recruitment strategy for Indonesia\u2019s\nJemaah Islamiyah (Abuza 2006, p. 78).\nAre these traits due to nature or nurture? Our evidence on freshmen\nstudents (Table 9) indicates that individuals with specific political and\nreligious views, arguably reflecting an underlying forma mentis, self-\nselect into engineering programs, rather than come to their courses\ntabula rasa. The education they receive is unlikely to correct for the\ntraits discussed above. Friedrich von Hayek, in 1952, made a strong\ncase for the peculiarity of the engineering mentality, which in his view\nis the result of an education which does not train them to understand\nindividuals and their world as the outcome of a social process in which\nspontaneous behaviours and interactions play a significant part.\nRather, it fosters on them a script in which a strict \u2018\u2018rational\u2019\u2019 control\nof processes plays the key role (Hayek 1952, pp. 94-102): this would\nmake them on the one hand less adept at dealing with the confusing\ncausality of the social and political realms and the compromise and\ncircumspection that these entail, and on the other hand inclined to\nthink that societies should operate orderly akin to well-functioning\nmachines \u2013 a feature which is reminiscent of the Islamist engineers in\n13 \u2018\u2018Military Studies in the Jihad against\nthe Tyrants\u2019\u2019, used in court in the trial, held\nin New York from January to May 2001,\nagainst four men charged in the 1998 em-\nbassy bombings in East Africa.

(Hayek 1952, p. 102)\n9. Frustrated ambitions\nEven if it could be proven beyond dispute, the mindset hypothesis\ncannot be the whole story. Why is the link between Islamic radicalism\nand engineering absent in Saudi Arabia? And, given their putative\nright-wing inclination, what can explain the strong presence of engi-\nneers among left-wing extremists in 1970s Turkey and Iran, and their\nmoderate presence in the Palestinian Fatah, contrary to their glaring\nabsence everywhere else in this type of groups? These \u2018\u2018anomalies\u2019\u2019\nindicate that the social conditions in Islamic countries are likely to\nplay a key part in explaining the patterns of radicalization.\nThe position of engineers in Middle Eastern and North African countries\nResearching Middle East educational systems we encountered time\nand again a prominent feature of engineering: together with medicine\nand natural sciences, it is the most prestigious subject and has high entry\nrequirements.15 Enrolling for an engineering degree is a strong sign of\nabove-average talent and ambition. A degree in engineering carries\nmore than a mere technical expertise, but also high social status\n(Cornand 1990; Wickham 2002). Many students choose it as much be-\ncause of their interest in the subject as because of the prestige it con-\nfers (Hanafi 1990, p. 173). \u2018\u2018Muhandis\u2019\u2019, engineer, is a title of honour\nin Arab countries.\nMany Middle East regimes entertained a technocratic rhetoric of\ndevelopment and actively encouraged the growth of technical faculties\nand the mass enrolment of students (Richards and Waterbury 1996,\npp. 133-142). Even more than other elite subjects engineering has had\n15 Moore 1994, p. 46 sq.; Cornand 1990,\np. 192; Sonbol 1988, pp. 26 sq.; Kepel 1993,\npp. 136 sq.\n23\nviolence in politics: the case of the engineers\na special attraction. It is of more direct practical value, it conveys an\nestablished solidity lacking in more academic pursuits, and arguably\ndoes not lead one to challenge traditional religious tenets (Chehabi\n1990, pp. 89 sq.).\nIndividuals with above-average skills selected on merit are, one\nwould expect, particularly exposed to the frustration and the sense of\ninjustice that comes from finding their professional future hampered\nby lack of opportunities. This happened on a large scale as a result of\nthe economic and technological development failures that Middle East\ncountries have witnessed since the 1970s.16 A particularly painful\neconomic crisis set in with the collapse of the oil price after 1982, right\naround the time in which many engineers in our sample went through\nuniversity and became radicalised. The effect of the lack of opportu-\nnities was intensified by the corrupt, state-driven job allocation.\nFor the [Egyptian] graduates who had been socialized to view\nthemselves as a meritocratic elite, perhaps the greatest source of\nbitterness was what they perceived as an erosion of the link between\nmerit and reward. (Wickham 2002, p. 159)\nIt appears that engineers\u2019 and OEDs\u2019 high ambitions and high\nfrustration collided. They felt fooled by the development rhetoric of\ntheir regimes and felt they deserved more than they could get. They\nwere not just frustrated on a self-interested level, but felt unable to\ndischarge a collective responsibility in modernizing Islamic countries,\nto live up professionally to their role as \u2018\u2018vanguards\u2019\u2019 of society in\nwhich regimes had cast them (Wickham 2002, p. 32; Apter 1965,\npp. 219 sq.). This negative experience is a plausible factor that\ncontributed to their radicalisation. While it was felt more by people\nwith higher education than by the rest of the population, and could\nthus explain the general over-representation of the highly educated\namong Islamic radicals, it was felt even more strongly by the high\nachievers. This negative experience is a very plausible factor that\ncontributed to their radicalisation. Detailed accounts of Egypt\u2019s\neducation, development, and labour market history fit this explanation\nperfectly and link it explicitly to radicalization of university gradu-\nates.17 Engineers\u2019 declining socio-economic status and frustrations\nafter the 1970s are well-documented for a number of Arab countries.18\n16 Longuenesse 1990; Oxford Analytica\n2006; UNDP 2003, pp. 97-109.\n17 Ibrahim 1980; Moore 1994; Kepel\n1993; Wickham 2002.\n18 Cf. Longuenesse 1990, 2000; Akkache\n1990; Hanafi 1990; Cornand 1990.\n24\ndiego gambetta and steffen hertog\nThese signs point to a classic explanation of the onset of rebel\nmovements \u2013 frustrated rising expectations and relative deprivation \u2013\ndating back to Aristotle and Tocqueville (Davies 1962; Gurr 1970).\nThis explanation has been traditionally used to explain inter-country\ndifferences in radicalisation, while in this case it could account not so\nmuch for the emergence of the movement as a whole as for the social\ncomposition within each country\u2019s radical sector. It could explain why\nmore graduates generally radicalised in the Middle East and why more\nengineers and OEDs in particular did so, even in the case of several\nleftist movements. Conversely, it could also explain why in the West\nand in Singapore, both of which unlike Middle Eastern countries have\nseen very successful economic development, much fewer graduates are\nfound among radicals.\nThe Saudi exception\nIf frustration with dismal professional opportunities indeed con-\ntributed to their radicalization, we should find less radical engineers\nwhere conditions were more favourable. This is exactly what the\nexception of Saudi Arabia seems to demonstrate. Saudi Arabia is the\nonly nation whose violent radicals show no over-representation of engi-\nneers in our sample. There is very good evidence that Saudi engineers\nhave had much better labour market chances than their peers in any of\nthe non-Gulf Middle Eastern states. The Saudi market has long been\nable to absorb all its graduates from prestigious technical subjects. The\nSaudi private sector has time and again petitioned the government to\nproduce more graduates with technical education.19 As the human\nresources manager of a large Saudi bank told one of us, unlike in other\ncountries where business graduates are the most sought after, their\nfirst recruitment target are the engineers.20 With such favourable\nlabour market conditions it is even surprising that we still find two\nengineers in our samples.\nRepression and resentment\nWe now have the elements of a potentially explosive mix. However,\nthis would have remained inert had it not been for one crucial factor: the\n19 Interviews with private sector represen-\ntatives, Riyadh, 2003 to 2005.\n20 Interview with Norlida Azmi, assistant\ngeneral manager, SAMBA Financial Group,\nRiyadh, December 2005.\n25\nviolence in politics: the case of the engineers\nharsh repression on the part of the authoritarian Islamic governments,\nwhich by all accounts played a crucial part in inducing radicalisation\ngenerally regardless of the engineering phenomenon.\nIn Turkey, a country in which both democratic institutions and\neconomic development have been in relatively better shape, we find\nfewer violent Islamic extremists of any kind. Elsewhere, repressive and\ncorrupt regimes that failed to live up to their developmental promises\nnarrowed the openings for frustrated elites to manifest their opposition.\nOther than acquiescence, joining radical movements became the only\noption (Hafez 2003; Wiktorowicz 2004).\nBy itself, however, repression cannot explain the overrepresentation\nof the engineers, as it could have affected individuals with other degrees.\nIts specific effects could be of two kinds: either engineers were already\noverrepresented among the opposition movements targeted by repres-\nsion and became radicalised by the experience just like everyone else;\nrepression would thus be relevant for everyone whether engineers or\nnon-engineers in the same way. Or engineers were not initially over-\nrepresented among those who suffered from repression, but responded\nto it in a more extreme way; in this case repression might have interacted\nwith the mindset leading more engineers to become violent extremists.\nThe stronger presence of OEDs among peaceful Islamists movements\nmakes the latter more plausible for in so far as repression targeted\nIslamic movements of all descriptions, OEDs too should have been\nexposed to it.\nTo be relevant for our puzzle, repression and Islamic radical ideology\nmust have interacted with \u2018\u2018the engineering mindset\u2019\u2019 in a special way.\nBy canvassing a stricter version of the religion, it offered the best\navailable opportunity to strengthen the flagging confidence of aspiring\n\u0002elites vis-a`-vis Western technical and cultural supremacy, and became\nthe haven for frustrated individuals of high potential. Islamic ideology\nproved a peculiarly well suited means to reduce the cognitive dissonance\nand turn resentment into a political resource. Its cocktail of tradition\nand modernization might have been a particularly good match for\nengineers. This is arguably the crucial juncture at which the effects of\nfrustrated expectations, individual as well as collective, joined forces\nwith the engineering mindset. Where would-be militant engineers had\nthe choice between joining a secular and traditional leftist group or an\nIslamic one, they chose the latter in greater numbers: in 1970s Iran\nhumanities and social science students dominated among Marxist\nguerrillas, whereas \u2018\u2018physical sciences\u2019\u2019 dominated among the Islamo-\nmarxist Mojahedin E-Khalk (Hoffman 1995, p. 206). And in Palestine\n26\ndiego gambetta and steffen hertog\nproportionally many more engineers opted to join Hamas than secular\nFatah.\n10. An overview\nThe most plausible explanation of the engineers\u2019 over-representa-\ntion among violent Islamic radicals everywhere lies in the joint effect\nof two causes. Without the severe lack of professional opportunities\nthat they had to endure in Middle Eastern countries we would not find\nan over-representation of graduates, especially from elite degrees,\namong violent Islamic radicals \u2013 as indeed we do not find it either in\nthe West, in Singapore or even in Saudi Arabia where we know that\ngraduates fared much better professionally. This pattern clearly points\nto the importance of relative deprivation and frustrated expectations,\na theory that may have been abandoned too hastily, partly perhaps\nbecause it was applied at too macro a level, that is to explain country\nrather than group differences.\nHowever, without their mindset, which inclines them to take more\nextreme conservative and religious positions everywhere, even in Mid-\ndle Eastern countries engineers would have behaved as those with\nOEDs, largely limiting themselves to non-violent forms of radical-\nisation. The mindset could also explain why even in the Western and\nSouth East Asian groups in which graduates did not experience the same\nprofessional frustration they had in Middle Eastern countries, the\nengineers\u2019 overrepresentation is strong: even if there are very few\ngraduates, most of them are engineers. In the case of the Middle East,\ndeprivation and mindset seem to have worked together, selecting elite\ngraduates first and then engineers among them, which could explain the\nmuch larger scale of the phenomenon, while in the West and in\nSingapore mindset alone seems to explain the phenomenon, which in\nabsolute term is much smaller.\nThe only other case in which we find a trace of engineers\u2019 pro-\nminence outside of Islamic violent groups is, consistent with the\nmindset hypothesis, among the most extreme right-wing movements,\nespecially in the US and in Germany, where it is all the more striking\nagain given the general low level of education of the members of such\ngroups. Here we have perhaps the only other case in which the\nmindset alone has activated engineers into resorting to violent action \u2013\ntheir absolute number is tiny, but disproportionate relative to other\ntypes of graduates.\n27\nviolence in politics: the case of the engineers\nB I B L I O G R A P H Y\nAbrahamian Ervand, 1989.
