Male infants were at significantly higher risk (odds ratio 1.84). In addition, having non-atopic\nparents who introduced solid foods before 10 weeks post-term or having at least one atopic parent\nrepresented a significant risk scenario (odds ratio 2.94).\nConclusions: Early introduction of a diverse range of solid foods may predispose the preterm infant to\neczema development by 12 months post-term. Furthermore, non-atopic parents who practice early as\nopposed to late introduction of solid foods may be exposing preterm infants to a greater risk of eczema by\n12 months post-term.\nT\nhe European Society for Paediatric Allerogology and\nClinical Immunology (ESPACI) Committee on\nHypoallergenic Formulas and the European Society for\nPaediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition\n(ESPGHAN) Committee on Nutrition has commented on\ncurrent unresolved issues in the treatment and prevention of\nfood allergy in early life.1 Reference to the role of solid\nfeeding (weaning) practices in the cause or prevention of\nfood allergy, including eczema, was limited.\nAttempts to prevent or delay the development of allergic\ndisorders in infants have been concentrated in three areas.\nFirst, exclusion diets during pregnancy may reduce the\nonset of allergy in high risk infants\u2014that is, in infants\nwhere one or both parents are atopic, but the definitive\nstudy is still to be carried out.2 Second, maternal exclusion\ndiets (in relation to milk and eggs) during lactation may\nbenefit some breast fed high risk infants with eczema.3\u20135\nThere is also evidence that maternal exclusion diets during\nlate gestation and lactation benefit the high risk infant.6\u20138\nHowever, in a seven year follow up study of combined\nmaternal and infant avoidance,9 perinatal maternal\/infant\nfood avoidance failed to modify atopic disease at 7 years of\nage compared with the infant feeding practices customarily\nfollowed. The third area has centred on the introduction of\nfoods other than milk to the infants\u2019 diet; the weaning\nperiod. Kajaosaari and Saarinen10 and Wilson and collea-\ngues11 have shown in full term infants that the early\nintroduction of solid food (before 3 months10 or 15 weeks11)\nis associated with a higher prevalence of atopic dermatitis\nat 6 months and respiratory illness at 10 years, compared\nwith the introduction of solid foods after 6 months10 or\n15 weeks.11 There is also evidence from New Zealand, in a 10\nyear follow up study of full term infants, that \u2018\u2018children\nexposed to four or more different types of solid food before\n4 months had risks of recurrent or chronic eczema that were\n2.9 times those of children who were not exposed to early\nsolid feeding\u2019\u2019.12\nA review of the literature revealed that no data exist on\nevidence for appropriate solid feeding practices for preterm\ninfants in the prevention of allergic disease development.\nThese infants, who could be both low birth weight and small\nfor gestational age, may also be at greater risk than their full\nterm counterparts for the development of atopic disorders\nbecause of their relatively immature immunological and\nphysiological systems.13\nWe have reported previously on the development of\nallergies in a small cohort of small for gestational age\ninfants14 and on the weaning practices of a cohort of preterm\ninfants.15 Here we report the influence of solid food patterns\non the development of eczema in the same cohort of preterm\ninfants followed to 12 months corrected age (post-term),\ntaking into account possible confounding factors including\nthose previously associated with eczema development. The\nmain aim of the study was to establish associations, if any,\nbetween feeding patterns in preterm infants and subsequent\ndevelopment of eczema, taking into account confounding\nfactors.\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS\nStudy population\nSubjects were recruited from a cross section of socioeconomic\ngroups in the Surrey and Hampshire areas of southeast\nEngland using the Royal Surrey County Hospital (Guildford),\nSt Peter\u2019s Hospital (Chertsey), and Frimley Park Hospital\n(Frimley). When a preterm birth (,37 weeks gestational\nage) occurred in the delivery suite and provided that the baby\nwas in reasonably good health, study midwives approached\nthe mother after she returned to the maternity unit and\ninformed her of the study, seeking her agreement and that of\nher partner to participate. Parents volunteered for the study\nafter reading an information sheet; two to three weeks\nelapsed before written consent was sought and given. Any\ninfant whose parents agreed to take part was recruited.\nShortly after the mother\/infant pair returned home they\nreceived a visit from a study midwife and a record was made\nof milk feeding practices during the time the infant was in\nhospital. Milk feeding practices in the hospital were in\naccordance with the wishes of the parents, though there was\nno requirement to give written consent for the feeding of\ncows\u2019 milk infant formula.\n309\nwww.archdischild.com\n group.bmj.com on November 18, 2010 - Published by adc.bmj.comDownloaded from \nThe questionnaires\nOnce the mother\/infant pair had been recruited onto the\nstudy, they were visited by the study midwives at home at\nregular intervals until the infant was 12 months post-term.\nDetailed demographic data were recorded for each infant and\nhis\/her family, including socioeconomic status, number of\nsiblings, parents\u2019 tobacco use, the presence of furry pets, and\ncentral heating. Information on infant feeding practices was\nrecorded via a detailed food frequency questionnaire,\nadministered by the study midwives to the mother on\nenrolment and at four monthly intervals to 12 months\npost-term. The mothers were asked to recall the number\nand type of milk feeds given prior to the introduction of solid\nfoods.\nInfants were categorised into seven subgroups based on\ntheir milk feeding practices prior to solid food introduction:\n(1) exclusively breast fed, n = 11; (2) breast milk and\nhypoallergenic formula (Pepti-Junior, Nutricia, Trowbridge,\nWilts BA14 0XQ), n = 25; (3) breast milk, hypoallergenic\nformula, and any cows\u2019 milk formula, n = 22; (4) breast fed\nat some point and receiving cows\u2019 milk formula less than one\nthird of the time prior to the introduction of solid foods,\nn = 31; (5) breast fed at some point and receiving cows\u2019 milk\nformula one third to two thirds of the time prior to solid food\nintroduction, n = 68; (6) breast fed at some point and\nreceiving cows\u2019 milk formula more than two thirds of the\ntime prior to solid food introduction, n = 63; and (7)\nexclusively fed cows\u2019 milk formula, n = 37.\nInformation was collected retrospectively on solid food\npractices and has been published elsewhere.15 The timings\n(corrected age) were recorded for the introduction of 12\nindividually listed foods: baby cereal, cheese, eggs, fish, fruit,\nmeat, meat with vegetables, baby rice, baby rusks, vegetables,\nyoghurt, and other desserts. The timing of the earliest of\nthese 12 foods was deemed to correspond to the age of solid\nfood introduction. In view of the findings of Fergusson and\ncolleagues,12 the timing of the introduction of four or more of\nthese foods was extracted to investigate the possible\nchronological relation between diet and eczema.\nOutcome measures\nAll infants were assessed at 12 months post-term by a\npaediatrician who was unaware of the atopic status of the\ninfants\u2019 families. This assessment included a physical\nexamination, an assessment of the presence (or absence) of\nrecurrent skin, chest, nasal, eye, and gastrointestinal symp-\ntoms, and a structured parental interview by questionnaire,\nadapted from the Early Treatment of the Atopic Child (ETAC)\nStudy.16 Eczema was defined as dryness, erythema, itching, or\nexcoriation lasting for more than 30 days in one year, as\ndiagnosed by the family general practitioner. Lower respira-\ntory symptoms were defined as persistent recurrent nocturnal\ncough disturbing sleep on more than three consecutive nights\nor a wheeze of any duration. Upper respiratory symptoms\nwere defined as nasal symptoms when recurrent sneezing,\nrunny nose, blocked nose, or any two of these three\nsymptoms lasting longer than two weeks in an episode were\nreported to the study paediatrician. Eye symptoms were\ndefined as watery, itchiness, redness, or swollen eyelids for\nmore than 48 hours in any one episode, not associated with\ninfection. Gastrointestinal symptoms were defined as more\nthan 48 hours of vomiting, diarrhoea (not associated with\ninfection), or swelling of the lips of any duration.\nConfounding exposures\nFamilies were classified as either non-atopic or atopic. They\nwere classified as atopic according to the following criteria:\n(1) by a closed question from a questionnaire, indicating a\nhistory of asthma\/wheeze, eczema (skin rash), urticaria,\nreactions to foods (vomiting, diarrhoea, nausea), migraine,\ncontact rashes, hay fever, and\/or persistent runny nose;\n(2) skin prick tests (SPT) to common allergens (three trees,\nsix grasses, cat, dog, house dust mite, two common\nmoulds, cows\u2019 milk, and chicken egg) yielding a wheal\ngreater than or equal to the histamine dihydrochloride\n(10 mg\/ml) control response when the saline control gave a\nnegative result; and (3) total serum IgE antibody level\n.80 kU\/l. Families were classified as atopic if the mother or\nfather (or both) was positive in at least two of the three\ncriteria described.\nOther potential confounding exposures included the\ninfant\u2019s gender and gestational age, the number of siblings,\nsmoking in the household, and the presence of furry pets.\nEthical approval\nThe study received approval from the North West Surrey\nLocal Research Ethics Committee on 1 November 1996\n(reference number PRO\/107\/96) and from the South West\nLocal Research Ethics Committee on 12 November 1996\n(reference number CT0793.107.166).\nStatistical analysis\nSimple descriptive statistics were derived from the overall\ngroup in the form of means, medians, standard deviations\n(SDs), and ranges. Comparisons between groups of infants\nfrom atopic and non-atopic backgrounds were undertaken\nusing the x2 or the Mann-Whitney U test. Differences were\ntaken as significant if p , 0.05. Stepwise logistic regression\nwas used to model eczema outcome against the confounding\nexposures described above, plus milk feeding and solid\nfeeding regimens. In addition, possible interaction effects\nwere evaluated between gender and time by which four or\nmore foods had been introduced. Statistical analysis was\nundertaken using SAS version 6.\nRESULTS\nStudy population\nThree hundred and twenty nine infants were recruited onto\nthe study from January 1997 to December 1998; 257 infants,\n140 (55%) male and 117 (45%) female, belonging to 219\nfamilies completed the study\u2014a withdrawal rate of 21.9%.\nThere were many stages at which infants were withdrawn\nfrom the study, ranging from immediately after the\nmother\u2019s written acceptance (at which point no demo-\ngraphic data were available regarding the parents) to a point\nin time at which it became evident that a parent had not\nundergone skin prick testing. Hence it was deemed imprac-\ntical to carry out a comparison of the dropouts against the\nstudy group because of the varying levels of missing\ndemographic data.\nThere were 183 singletons, 34 sets of twins, and two sets of\ntriplets. The concordance between identical and non-identical\nsiblings in the twins was not established. The majority of the\nparents (54.8%) were classified into socioeconomic groups I\nand II as defined by the father\u2019s occupation.\nThe mean maternal age was 30.8 (SD 5.24) years and\nranged from 17 to 47 years. The mean paternal age was 33.1\n(SD 5.54) years and ranged from 18 to 51 years. The smoking\nhabits of the parents varied during the study. Fourteen per\ncent of the mothers smoked when recruited onto the study,\nbut by the end of the study 17.8% were smoking. Paternal\nsmoking fell from 26.9% at the start of the study to 23.7% at\nthe end. Fifty seven per cent of the households had pets\n(dogs, cats, and other furry animals). Forty seven per cent of\ninfants had older siblings; their atopic status was unknown.\nMost of the homes of the infants (96.5%) had gas, oil, or\nelectric central heating.\n310 Morgan, Williams, Norris, et al\nwww.archdischild.com\n group.bmj.com on November 18, 2010 - Published by adc.bmj.comDownloaded from \nAtopic status of parents\nThe atopic status of the mothers and fathers was based on\nresults from the questionnaire, the SPT, and total serum IgE\nlevels. Table 1 shows the results of these assessments. In the\nmothers, the results of the assessment from the question-\nnaire gave a noticeably higher prevalence of atopy than the\nSPT and IgE levels. The positive test results from the fathers\nwere more compatible. Overall 32.4% of mothers and 33.0%\nof fathers were assessed as atopic.\nAs far as the results of the family data are concerned, there\nwere four families (1.8%) where classification could only be\nmade for the mother; these four mothers were all atopic.\nThere were 24 (11.0%) families where both parents were\nclassified as atopic, 43 (19.6%) families where the mother\nwas classified as atopic with the father non-atopic, and 47\n(21.0%) families where the father was classified as atopic\nwith the mother non-atopic. In the remaining 101 (46.1%)\nfamilies both parents were classified as non-atopic. There was\ntherefore at least one atopic parent in 118 (53.9%) families.\nThe infants\nThe mean gestational age and mean birth weight of infants\nwere similar in those having an atopic background compared\nwith those from a non-atopic background (table 2). The\ninfants with an atopic background comprised 75 (54.4%)\nmale and 63 (45.7%) females; those with a non-atopic\nbackground comprised 65 (54.6%) males and 54 (45.4%)\nfemales. Milk feeding patterns differed from one infant to\nanother and only 11 infants were exclusively breast fed prior\nto solid food introduction. Solid foods were introduced from\nfour weeks to 17 weeks post-term.15\nThe prevalence of eczema (with or without other symp-\ntoms) at 12 months post-term was 35.8% in the entire cohort\n(table 3). Eczema alone occurred in 21.4% of the infants,\nwhile a further 14.4% had eczema with other symptoms;\nanother 15.2% of infants had no eczema but other symptoms.\nOf the 131 infants who either had eczema (with or without\nother symptoms) or who had no eczema but other symptoms\nat 12 months post-term, 75 (57.3%) had an atopic back-\nground and 56 (42.7%) had a non-atopic background. Of\nthose infants who had no eczema and no other symptoms at\n12 months post-term, 63 (50%) had an atopic background\nand 63 (50%) had a non-atopic background (x2 test,\np = 0.224). Male infants had a statistically significant higher\nprevalence of allergic disease compared with female infants\n(83 (59.3%) and 48 (41.0%) respectively; x2 test, p , 0.004).\nInvestigation of the 34 sets of twins revealed that eight\npairs (23.5%) had eczema at 12 months post-term, 13 pairs\n(38.2%) had no eczema, and 13 pairs (38.2%) had one twin\nwith eczema and one twin with no eczema. Of the two sets of\ntriplets, one set had an infant with eczema and two infants\nwith no eczema while the other set comprised three infants\nwith no eczema.\nStatistical modelling of eczema (with or without other\nsymptoms)\nTable 4 shows the outcome of the stepwise logistic regression\nanalysis in the form of adjusted odds ratios with 95%\nconfidence intervals. No relation was found between any of\nthe milk feeding groups and the development of eczema\n(with or without other symptoms) by 12 months post-term.\nHowever, the introduction of four or more solid foods at or\nbefore 17 weeks post-term was a significant risk factor. In\naddition, having non-atopic parents who introduced solid\nfoods before 10 weeks post-term or having at least one atopic\nparent represented a significant risk for developing eczema\n(with or without other symptoms) by 12 months post-term.\nEarly introduction of infant cereal was also a risk factor.\nWithin the observed experience range of 5\u201350 weeks, an\nadjusted odds ratio of 1.07 was found for a delay of one week\nin introducing cereals. Hence, a two week delay would\nincrease the odds ratio by a factor 1.072 (i.e. 1.145), and a\n12 week delay would increase the odds ratio by a factor of\n1.0712 (i.e. 2.252).\nWhen considering non-modifiable factors, being a male\ninfant was a significant risk factor for the development of\neczema (with or without other symptoms) by 12 months\npost-term. Table 5 shows variables found not to be\nstatistically significantly related to the development of\neczema (with or without other symptoms).\nTable 1 Summary statistics of tests relating to atopic status for mothers and fathers from\nthe 219 families\nTest\nPositive Negative No assessment\nn % n % n %\nMothers\nSPT 60 27.4 139 63.5 20 9.1\nQuestionnaire 93 42.5 126 57.5 0 0\nIgE >80 kU\/l 52 23.7 136 62.1 31 14.2\nOverall atopic status 71 32.4 148 67.6 0 0\nFathers\nSPT 74 33.8 122 55.7 23 10.5\nQuestionnaire 76 34.7 142 64.8 1 0.5\nIgE >80 kU\/l 59 26.9 112 51.1 48 21.9\nOverall atopic status 71 33.0 144 65.8 4 1.8\nTable 2 Summary statistics for gestational age and birth weight of the 257 preterm\ninfants according to their atopic background\nParents\u2019 atopic background n Mean SD Range\nGestational age (weeks) Atopic 138 34.4 1.9 28\u201336\nNon-atopic 119 34.4 1.7 28\u201336\nBirth weight (kg) Atopic 138 2.4 0.5 1.2\u20133.6\nNon-atopic 119 2.3 0.5 1.0\u20133.4\nWeaning and allergies in preterm infants 311\nwww.archdischild.com\n group.bmj.com on November 18, 2010 - Published by adc.bmj.comDownloaded from \nDISCUSSION\nStudy population\nRecruitment of the study population was undertaken in\nan affluent part of England with a strong commitment\nfrom the parents to the study, as measured by the low\nwithdrawal rate (under 22%) over the study period, which\ninvolved about 14 months for each family. The fact that\nthe majority of parents were classified into socioeconomic\ngroups I and II reflects the geographical area of recruitment;\nallergic disease is reported to be more frequent in affluent\nurban than in affluent rural groups.17 Although the\nparents were aware of the study objectives, they were not\nprovided with specific advice on infant feeding guidelines; if\nthis was requested, the study midwives provided general\nadvice only.\nEstimated prevalence of eczema in the UK\u2019s infant and\nchild population is high. In a group of children aged 6\u20137 years\nin the north of England the prevalence of \u2018\u2018atopic eczema\u2019\u2019\nwas 28%.18 In the UK ISAAC study, 22.5% of the children\naged 12\u201314 years had eczema.19 In this cohort, 35.8% had\neczema at 12 months post-term. Alhough this may be\nconsidered to be higher than expected, the prematurity of\nthe cohort must be taken into consideration, together with\nfactors such as early solid food introduction and the early\nintroduction of a diversity of foods which also had important\neffects.\nThe local advisory committee did not permit SPT to be\nundertaken on the infants. This assessment is viewed by\nsome as the \u2018\u2018gold standard\u2019\u2019 for the identification of atopic\ndisease, but we are unable to report here the numbers of\npositive or negative reactions. Because SPT were not\nperformed, it was not possible to establish the numbers of\ninfants where their eczema was associated with a non-IgE\nmediated food allergy. Delayed hypersensitivity (T lympho-\ncyte mediated) to cows\u2019 milk typically manifests as skin\nreactions.20\nA high prevalence of atopic disease was also apparent in\nthe parents, with the atopic classification of over 30% of\nmothers and fathers leading to the presence of at least one\natopic parent in over 50% of the families involved. This could\npartly be explained by the self-selecting nature of the study,\nwhere parents with an atopic nature might have been more\nlikely to volunteer. However, the categorisation of atopic\nstatus was based on SPT, as well as an arbitrarily high serum\nIgE level and the results of a self administered questionnaire,\nthus resulting in a robust assessment of atopic status.\nThe practice of in vitro fertilisation and the fact that\nrelatively more twins and triplets are born prematurely than\nsingletons may explain the numbers of twins and triplets in\nthe cohort. As the concordance of the twins was not\nestablished and the number of twins and triplets was\nrelatively small, no meaningful conclusion could be drawn\nregarding their feeding habits and subsequent allergy\ndevelopment.\nMilk feeding practices\nOf the 11 infants who were exclusively breast fed until solid\nfood introduction, five (45.5%) had eczema at some point\nduring the study. The complexity of milk feeding regimens\nwas apparent from the groupings described in the Subjects\nand Methods section, and reflects the variety of ways in\nwhich infants are fed initially in neonatal care units in the\nUK. Others who have studied full term infants have reported\na protective role for exclusive breast feeding in the develop-\nment of atopic disease.4 11 21 However it was not possible here\nto investigate the role of exclusive breast feeding in the\nprevention of allergic disorders for preterm infants, owing to\nthe small number of infants experiencing this regimen.\nProtective effect of delayed introduction of solid foods\nThe third adjusted odds ratio category in table 4 highlights\nthe opportunity for non-atopic parents to reduce the risk of\nTable 3 Prevalence of eczema (with or without other symptoms), no symptoms, and other\nsymptoms diagnosed by 12 months post-term for 257 preterm infants\nSymptom group Prevalence\nEczema\nLower respiratory\nsymptoms\nUpper respiratory\nsymptoms\nGastrointestinal\nsymptoms Number Percentage\nYes No No No 55 21.4\nYes Yes No No 17 6.6\nYes No Yes No 12 4.8\nYes Yes Yes No 5 1.9\nYes No No Yes 2 0.8\nYes Yes No Yes 1 0.4\nNo No No No 126 49.0\nNo Yes No No 22 8.6\nNo Yes Yes No 6 2.3\nNo No No Yes 6 2.3\nNo No Yes No 5 1.9\nTable 4 Adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals for the development of eczema (with or without other symptoms)\nby 12 months post-term\nGroups contrasted in adjusted odds ratio\nAdjusted odds\nratio\n95% CI\nLower limit Upper limit\nMale, n = 140 Female, n = 117 1.84 1.04 3.27\nFour or more foods by 17 weeks post-term, n = 203 Less than four foods by 17 weeks post-term, n = 54 3.49 1.51 8.05\nNon-atopic parents with solid food introduction\n,10 weeks post-term or any atopic parents, n = 162\nNon-atopic parents with solid food introduction at\n>10 weeks post-term, n = 95\n2.94 1.57 5.52\nNo central heating, n = 9 Central heating, n = 248 6.37 1.31 30.90\nCereal introduced at N+1 weeks from term Cereal introduced at N weeks from term 1.07 1.03 1.11\n312 Morgan, Williams, Norris, et al\nwww.archdischild.com\n group.bmj.com on November 18, 2010 - Published by adc.bmj.comDownloaded from \nthe development of eczema (with or without other symp-\ntoms) during the first year by delaying the introduction of\nsolid foods until at least 10 weeks post-term. However, this\nregimen has no corresponding benefit for families where one\nor both parents are atopic. The identification of this selective\n\u2018\u2018risk reducing regimen\u2019\u2019 can be set in the context of evidence\nfor the full term infant, where reducing the risk of the\ndevelopment of respiratory disease during the first seven\nyears was associated with solid food introduction after\n15 weeks from birth.11 As Zeiger and Heller showed,9 it is\nvery difficult to moderate the later development of atopic\ndisorders by early dietary manipulation. In that study,\nmothers in the intervention group avoided cows\u2019 milk, egg,\nand peanut in the last trimester and lactation. In addition,\nthe diet of the full term infants was manipulated so that they\navoided cows\u2019 milk to 12 months, egg to 2 years, and peanuts\nto 3 years. However, the results were disappointing when the\ncohort was followed to 7 years, as allergy associated with\nfoods, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, and asthma did not\ndiffer between the standard and intervention feeding groups,\nalthough significant differences were reported at 2 years. The\nauthors suggested that the diet intervention was probably too\nstringent and impractical for many mothers.\nAge of introduction of solid foods to the preterm\ninfant\nHigh dietary needs for energy and iron are not met in the\npreterm infant from breast milk alone after a certain point in\ntime, although a suitably fortified post-discharge cows\u2019 milk\ninfant formula may overcome the nutritional deficiencies. A\nstudy of weaning practices in the UK in the 1990s22 has\nshown that 67% and 82% of breast fed and formula fed\npreterm infants respectively were receiving solid foods by\n12 weeks from term. In contrast, Marriott and colleagues23\nhave reported in a small randomised controlled study of 68\npreterm infants that early (12 weeks from birth) nutrient\nenriched solid feeding was associated with enhanced length\ngrowth and iron status at 12 months post-term. In that study\nno information has been published regarding subsequent\ndevelopment of eczema. Here we have shown a benefit in\neczema outcome to the high risk preterm infant of waiting to\nintroduce solids to 10 weeks from term, though any\ndetrimental effects on growth or micronutrient status have\nnot yet been established.\nThe practical implementation of our findings should be\nviewed with caution, especially for those born at 34 weeks\ngestational age and earlier because of their high energy and\nnutrient needs.24 Currently, official recommendations on the\nintroduction of solid foods to the preterm infant (based on\nweight attainment of 5 kg25) are not universally followed.15\nThere is no consensus for such recommendations and they\nare not evidence based. In the development of feeding\nguidelines for the preterm infant, there will inevitably be\ntensions between the early introduction of solid foods, which\nwill benefit rapid (catch up) growth, and the late introduc-\ntion of certain solid foods, which will protect against eczema.\nType and frequency of solid food introduction\nThe early introduction of a diversified range of four or more\nsolid foods before 17 weeks post-term was shown to be\nassociated with a higher risk of eczema (with or without\nother symptoms) at 12 months post-term in our cohort. This\nphenomenon has been observed in the full term infant12\nwhere the provision of four foods or more from 17 weeks of\nage was associated with an increased risk of the development\nof recurrent or chronic eczema at the age of 10 years. There is\nlittle consensus on the first type of solid food to introduce,\nbut low allergen foods such as potatoes, baby rice, fruit, and\nvegetables have been advocated.26 Here the first food was\npredominantly a low allergenic food: baby rice.15 However, for\nthose infants where early introduction of multiple foods was\npractised, a significantly higher predisposition to eczema\ndevelopment was observed.\nSince the gluten content in cereal was not specified, the\nfinding that the \u2018\u2018late\u2019\u2019 introduction of cereal was a risk factor\nin the development of eczema (with or without other\nsymptoms) should be interpreted with caution. The relation\nwas weaker than for the other variables in the model as\nshown by the lower 95% confidence interval being close to\n1.00. That the introduction of baby rice was not found to be\nbeneficial in protecting against eczema development may\nagain be explained by the lack of a clear definition of cereals\ncontaining gluten.\nGender and central heating effects\nMale infants were at greater risk than female infants of being\ndiagnosed with eczema (with or without other symptoms) at\n12 months post-term. The gender effect is an unmodifiable\nbut well recognised factor associated with risk of atopy.9 As\ncentral heating was not specifically defined (no distinction\nwas made between gas, oil, and electricity) and most\nhouseholds had central heating of some sort, the finding\nthat its absence was a risk factor in the development of\neczema may be of little practical importance when set in the\ncontext of the other findings. An examination of the\ndescriptors for nine families without central heating revealed\nno specific common factor to explain the finding (for\nexample, if all families were atopic or all parents smoked).\nThis finding deserves further investigation.\nConclusions\nWe have established that the development of eczema in the\npreterm infant is influenced by certain solid feeding practices,\nand these practices are generally in concert with those for the\nfull term infant\u2014that is, to delay solid foods and to introduce\nsingle food components initially. Male infants and those with\nan atopic background were at greater risk of the development\nof eczema than the rest.\nTable 5 Variables found not to be statistically significant\nfor the development of eczema (with or without other\nsymptoms) by 12 months post-term\nMaternal age\nSingle infant verses twin\/triplet\nNumber of children less than 18 years old in the family\nMaternal\/paternal smoking at the time of recruitment\nPresence of pets in home\nWhether or not child had his\/her own bedroom\nGestational age at birth\nBirth weight\nTotal weeks of breast feeding\nNumber of weeks of breast feeding prior to solid food introduction\nWhether or not ever breast fed\nWhether or not exclusively breast fed before solid food introduction\nWhether or not infant cows\u2019 milk formula used before solid food\nintroduction\nWhether or not hypoallergenic formula used before solid food\nintroduction\nWeek at which cows\u2019 milk was introduced\nNumber of weeks from term cheese introduced\nNumber of weeks from term eggs introduced\nNumber of weeks from term fish introduced\nNumber of weeks from term fruit introduced\nNumber of weeks from term meat introduced\nNumber of weeks from term meat with vegetables introduced\nNumber of weeks from term baby rice introduced\nNumber of weeks from term baby rusks introduced\nNumber of weeks from term vegetables introduced\nNumber of weeks from term yoghurt introduced\nNumber of weeks from term other desserts introduced\nWeaning and allergies in preterm infants 313\nwww.archdischild.com\n group.bmj.com on November 18, 2010 - Published by adc.bmj.comDownloaded from \nFuture recommendations need to be evidence based.
