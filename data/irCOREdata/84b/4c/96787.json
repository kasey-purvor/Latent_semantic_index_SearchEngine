All rights reserved.\n628 T. Miura and P. K. Maini\ntal studies focus on the polarity and subsequent specification of each digit identity.\nIt has been shown that FGF4 and 8 secreted by the apical ectodermal ridge are crit-\nical for limb bud outgrowth and proximodistal patterning, while sonic hedgehog\nsecreted from the zone of polarizing activity plays a decisive role in establishing\nanteroposterior polarity of the limb pattern [for review, see Wolpert (1998), Gilbert\n(2000)]. On the other hand, theoretical studies concentrate on the periodic aspect of\npattern formation using the Turing reaction-diffusion model (Newman and Frisch,\n1979; Othmer, 1986; Newman et al., 1988; Downie and Newman, 1995) or its alter-\nnatives (Murray, 1993). They are largely ignored by experimental biologists, but\nrecently several reports provide supportive evidence for this periodic property. For\nexample, there exist several polydactylous mutant mice strains which have random\ndigit patterns which are difficult to explain using the one-by-one specification by\na positional information mechanism (Hayes et al., 1998). Moreover, the reaggre-\ngated limb, which does not have normal anteroposterior gene expression, can form\nnormal digit-like structures (Ros et al., 1994). Based on these findings the idea of\nperiodic pattern formation during limb development is gradually being accepted by\nexperimental biologists [see, for example, Wolpert (1998), Gilbert (2000)].\nSince the analysis of periodic pattern in vivo is quite difficult because the domain\nshape is complex and growing, several researchers utilize the limb micromass cul-\nture system for these studies (Owens and Solursh, 1981). In this culture system,\nlimb bud mesenchyme cells are dissociated into separate cells using trypsin, then\ncultured on a dish at high density. Some cells become chondrocytes while oth-\ners remain fibroblastic, resulting in a quasi-periodic, stripe-like chondrogenic pat-\ntern. Since this final pattern can be directly correlated with the two-dimensional\nreaction-diffusion pattern, it has been used to study periodic pattern formation in\nbiological systems (Newman, 1996). For example, it has been shown that the\nwavelength of the pattern can be changed by modulating the diffusion coefficient\nof the secreted molecules consistent with model predictions (Miura and Shiota,\n2000a). It has also been shown that TGF\u03b2\u2014specifically the TGF\u03b22 protein\u2014is a\ngood candidate to act as an activator molecule in the reaction-diffusion model in\nthis experimental system (Downie and Newman, 1994; Miura and Shiota, 2000b).\n(Throughout this paper we define the word \u2018activator\u2019 and \u2018inhibitor\u2019 as those used\nin a reaction-diffusion system, not the activator or inhibitor of differentiation as\nused in some experimental papers.)\nRecent experimental results address the issue of whether or not speed of pattern\nappearance in the reaction-diffusion system can be changed by changing a specific\ninteraction within the system. A recent report suggested that fibroblast growth\nfactor (FGF), a signaling molecule that is expressed at the tip of the developing\nlimb bud, can indirectly reinforce the lateral inhibitory effect in limb bud micro-\nmass culture (Moftah et al., 2002). Judging from its spatial distribution, FGF itself\ndoes not seem to be an inhibitor molecule, but it seems to reinforce the effect of\nthe inhibitor. In the course of re-examining this result, we found that the peri-\nodic pattern appears much earlier with FGF treatment [Fig. 1(b)] than in controls\nTuring Pattern Appearance Speed 629\n(a) Control-18h (b) FGF4(+) 18h\n(c) Control-120h (d) FGF4(+) 120h\nFigure 1.

(d) FGF4 treated cells cultured\nfor 120 h. The degree of chondrogenic differentiation is suppressed compared with the\ncontrol. The difference in wavenumber is not as apparent between the control and FGF4\ntreated cultures. Scale bar, 500 \u00b5m.\n[Fig. 1(a)]. This looks puzzling for experimental biologists because even when\nthe appearance of pattern is earlier, final chondrogenic differentiation seems to be\nsuppressed by FGF treatment [Fig. 1(c) and 1(d)]. The descriptive explanation by\nMoftah et al. (2002) might account for both observations, but we need more rigor-\nous mathematical analysis to see whether these two phenomena can be explained\nby a mechanism such as the reaction-diffusion model.\nWe undertook linear stability analysis to see whether a qualitative change in\none of the parameters in a Turing reaction-diffusion system results in increase or\ndecrease in the speed of pattern formation. We keep two points in mind to make\nthis analysis biologically relevant. Firstly, we confined our analysis to qualitative\ncharacteristics because we cannot obtain all the parameters even in the simple bio-\nlogical system described above. Secondly, we confined our analysis to the linear\nrange because the initial pattern appearance seemed to be quite an early event.\n630 T. Miura and P. K. Maini\nThe cell aggregate pattern first appeared 18\u201324 h after culture, while the final\npattern settled after 96\u2013120 h. In the present study, we analyze the change in\nthe maximum value of the dispersion relation in two types of reaction-diffusion\nsystems, one is the classic activator\u2013inhibitor scheme and the other is the sub-\nstrate depletion scheme, and confirm the result using numerical calculation. We\nalso undertake detailed analysis of a more realistic nonlinear model and discuss its\nbiological relevance.\n2. OBTAINING THE MAXIMUM IN THE DISPERSION RELATION\nWe consider the standard two species reaction-diffusion system as follows:\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n= f (u, v) + du\u0003u\n\u2202v\n\u2202t\n= g(u, v) + dv\u0003v, (1)\nwhere u(x, t) and v(x, t) are chemical concentrations at position x and time t .\nWithout loss of generality, we set f (0, 0) = g(0, 0) = 0 and initial spatial distri-\nbution of u, v as u0 and v0 respectively, which represents the small noise expected\nin a natural system.\nThe wavelength of the observed experimental pattern is much smaller than that of\nthe spatial domain, so we assert that the boundary conditions do not exert a strong\neffect on the final pattern, and take periodic boundary conditions. Here we only\nconsider the linear approximation about the initial value because the appearance of\nthe pattern is quite an early event, as described above. We set\nfu = \u2202 f\n\u2202u\n, gu = \u2202g\n\u2202u\n, fv = \u2202 f\n\u2202v\n, gv = \u2202g\n\u2202v\n(2)\nall evaluated at (0, 0) and linearly approximate the equation around (0, 0) to give\n(as usual)\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n= fuu + fvv + du\u0003u\n\u2202v\n\u2202t\n= guu + gvv + dv\u0003v. (3)\nWe suppose that the parameters in this experimental system are in the diffusion-\ndriven instability range because if we culture cells at very low density and observe\neach cell separately, which is equivalent to observing the dynamics of the reaction\nterms only, they remain stable and no chondrogenic differentiation or oscillatory\nTuring Pattern Appearance Speed 631\nfu (>0)\ngu (>0)\ngv (<0)\n(a) Activator-Inhibitor scheme\ndu\ndv\nv\n(inhibitor)\nu\n(activator)\nfv (< 0)\nfu (> 0)\ngu (< 0)\ngv (<0)\n(b) Substrate depletion scheme\ndu\ndv\nv\n(substrate)\nu\n(enzyme)\nfv (> 0)\nFigure 2.

(4)\nIn this study we consider both activator\u2013inhibitor and substrate depletion sche-\nmes, and the sign of the parameters are as follows: (Fig. 2)\n\u2022 Activator\u2013inhibitor scheme\n\u2014 fu > 0 (activator promotes its own production).\n\u2014 fv < 0 (inhibitor inhibits the production of activator).\n\u2014 gu > 0 (activator promotes the production of inhibitor).\n\u2014 gv < 0 (inhibitor decays).\n\u2014 dv > du (inhibitor diffuses faster than activator).\n\u2022 Substrate depletion scheme (cross-type reaction-diffusion)\n\u2014 fu > 0 (enzyme promotes its own production).\n\u2014 fv > 0 (enzyme promote its production by substrate).\n632 T.

If a slight\nchange in parameter results in an increase in the maximum of the dispersion relation, then\nthe prediction is that the pattern will appear earlier.\n\u2014 gu < 0 (substrate is consumed by an enzyme).\n\u2014 gv < 0 (enzyme decays).\n\u2014 dv > du (substrate diffuses faster than enzyme).\nTo determine an estimate on the time scale of patterning in the linear regime we\nset\nw =\n(\nu\nv\n)\n, A =\n( fu fv\ngu gv\n)\n, D =\n(\ndu 0\n0 dv\n)\n(5)\nand the above equation can be simplified to the form below:\nw\u2032 = Aw + D\u0003w (6)\nwhere \u2032 denotes differentiation with respect to time.\nIf we consider each wavenumber component separately using the Fourier trans-\nform, the solution for each wavenumber component is in general of the form\nw \u221d e\u03bbt sin(kx). (7)\nThen equation (6) becomes\n(A \u2212 \u03bbI \u2212 k2 D)w = 0. (8)\nWe require nontrivial solutions for w, so\nDet(A \u2212 \u03bbI \u2212 k2 D) = Det\n( fu \u2212 \u03bb \u2212 duk2 fv\ngu gv \u2212 \u03bb \u2212 dvk2\n)\n= (\u03bb \u2212 fu + duk2)(\u03bb \u2212 gv + dvk2) \u2212 fvgu = 0 (9)\nand hence we have the dispersion relation (see Fig. 3):\n\u03bb = 12\n(\nfu + gv \u2212 (du + dv)k2 \u00b1\n\u221a\n4 fvgu + ( fu \u2212 gv + (dv \u2212 du)k2)2\n)\n. (10)\nTuring Pattern Appearance Speed 633\nAmong the two \u03bb values, only the higher \u03bb value is relevant in this case because\nunder the diffusion-driven instability condition the lower \u03bb will always be negative.\nThis \u03bb value becomes positive in a certain range of k2, indicating that only certain\nwavelengths can grow. To obtain the k2 for which \u03bb has the largest positive value,\nwe differentiate \u03bb with respect to k2 and equate to zero, that is,\n\u2202\u03bb\n\u2202(k2)\n= 1\n2\n(\n\u2212du \u2212 dv + (dv \u2212 du)( fu \u2212 gv + (dv \u2212 du)k\n2)\u221a\n4 fvgu + ( fu \u2212 gv + (dv \u2212 du)k2)2\n)\n= 0. (11)\nBy solving this equation we obtain\nk2 = \u2212dudv( fu \u2212 gv) \u00b1 (du + dv)\n\u221a\u2212dudv fvgu\ndudv(dv \u2212 du) . (12)\nLooking at the value of k2, the denominator should be positive and \u2212dudv( fu \u2212\ngv) should be negative in both activator\u2013inhibitor and substrate depletion schemes\n( fu \u2212 gv > 0). Since k2 should not be negative, the k2 which gives maximum \u03bb\nvalue is\nk2 = \u2212dudv( fu \u2212 gv) + (du + dv)\n\u221a\u2212dudv fvgu\ndudv(dv \u2212 du) . (13)\nFrom (13) we can predict that in the physiological parameter range such as\ndu, dv \u2248 10\u22125 cm2 s\u22121 and fu, fv, gu, gv \u2248 10\u22121 s\u22121 this model will produce a\nstructure with wavelength of order 10\u22121 cm, which is exactly the case in this experi-\nmental system.\nThere are three necessary conditions for this value to be an admissible maximum\nvalue. First, since (13) is a square of the wavenumber, this must be larger than 0,\nthat is,\n(du + dv)\u221a\u2212dudv fvgu \u2212 dudv( fu \u2212 gv)\ndudv(dv \u2212 du) > 0. (14)\nAs du , dv , dv \u2212 du > 0, this condition is simplified as\n(du + dv)\n\u221a\u2212dudv fvgu \u2212 dudv( fu \u2212 gv) > 0. (15)\nThis condition can be derived from (4), but we use this inequality later for sim-\nplicity.\nSecond, this k2 value should give a local \u03bb maximum, not minimum. This is\neasily confirmed.\nThird, this wavenumber should be an admissible mode, that is, of the form\nk2 = n2\u03c02L2 , where L is the domain length and n an integer, to ensure that the\nboundary conditions are satisfied. To simplify the analysis, we will assume that\nthe \u03bbmax we compute below is a reasonable approximation to the growth rate of the\nadmissible mode with maximum growth rate. While not strictly true, this is a good\n634 T. Miura and P. K. Maini\napproximation for large wavenumber patterns where we change the parameter only\nslightly.\nSo we can obtain the maximum \u03bb value (\u03bbmax) for the reaction-diffusion system\nby substituting (10) with (13):\n\u03bbmax = dv fu \u2212 du gv \u2212 2\n\u221a\u2212dudv fvgu\ndv \u2212 du . (16)\nWe can directly obtain the value and make a quantitative prediction if we know all\nthe parameters, but this is almost impossible in a biological experimental system.\nHowever, in this case we have an experimental system in which a periodic pattern\nis formed and we can sometimes detect whether the pattern appears earlier or later\nby modifying a specific factor. If we can make qualitative predictions from the\nmodel as to whether pattern should appear earlier or later by modifying a model\nparameter in a specific direction, it is possible to qualitatively predict in which\npathway in the reaction-diffusion system the factor may be involved.\n3. EFFECT ON \u03bbmax OF CHANGING A SPECIFIC PARAMETER\nWe assume that, at (0, 0), fu, fv, gu, gv, du and dv are independent parameters\nand we consider how \u03bbmax changes as we vary each parameter in turn, keeping the\nothers fixed.\n3.1. Varying fu. By simple calculation we obtain\n\u2202\u03bbmax\n\u2202 fu =\ndv\ndv \u2212 du . (17)\ndv > du > 0, so this value should be positive.

NUMERICAL CALCULATION\nTo confirm the analysis we present numerical simulations for a simple reaction-\ndiffusion model. Currently no quantitative data on the interaction is known, so we\nuse a very simple model here, which only contains linear terms and a cubic term\nwhich limits the range of u.

To confirm this, we visualized\nthe time evolution of the pattern of the control system and \u2018experimentally treated\u2019\nsystem where one of these six parameters is increased by 10%. All of them seem\nto reach steady state after t = 200, but the speed of appearance of the pattern is\nquite different among these groups. It is observed that an increase in fu, fv and dv\nresults in earlier appearance of the pattern and an increase in gu , gv and du results in\nlater appearance of the pattern (Fig. 4), which is consistent with the mathematical\nprediction. On the other hand, in the substrate depletion scheme, an increase in fu,\ngu and dv results in the earlier appearance of the pattern and an increase in fv, gv\nand dv results in later appearance of the pattern (Fig. 5), which is also consistent\nwith the mathematical prediction.\nThe difference in the speed of pattern appearance seems quite obvious in all cases\nand usually we can detect the difference by a single run of numerical calculation.\nTo confirm the result above is not a specific case, we carried out the simulation\n40 times each with different initial conditions and automatically detected the time\nrequired for the difference between highest and lowest concentration of u to be 0.1.\nStatistically significant differences are detected among all the treated and control\nTuring Pattern Appearance Speed 637\nfu, t = 90 fv, t = 90\ngu, t = 200\ngv, t = 140\ndu, t = 130\ndv, t  = 100\n0.4\n0.2\n20 40 60 80 100\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.4\n0.4\n0.2\n20 40 60 80 100\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.4\n0.4\n0.2\n20 40 60 80 100\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.4\n0.4\n0.2\n20 40 60 80 100\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.4\n0.4\n0.2\n20 40 60 80 100\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.4\n0.4\n0.2\n20 40 60 80 100\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.4\nFigure 4.

ANALYSIS OF THE GIERER\u2013MEINHARDT TYPE REACTION\nDIFFUSION MODEL\n5.1. The model. The analysis above can be useful to determine what will happen\nwhen a specific interaction is blocked or promoted, but in actual experimental con-\nditions the interactions are sometimes cross-linked and it is unrealistic to consider\nthat the 4 linear reaction term parameters are independent. Here we undertake\ndetailed analysis of the Gierer\u2013Meinhardt type reaction-diffusion model (Gierer\nand Meinhardt, 1972), which is widely utilized in modeling various biological pat-\ntern formation phenomena.\nThe equations we use are\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n= k1 \u2212 k2u + k3 u\n2\nv\n+ du\u0003u\n\u2202v\n\u2202t\n= k4u2 \u2212 k5v + dv\u0003v, (29)\n640 T.

The analysis is similar to that above (details given in\nthe appendix) and a summary of the results is presented in Table 2.\n5.2. Numerical calculation\u2014both reinforcement of lateral inhibition and ear-\nlier pattern appearance can be induced by a single parameter change. We car-\nried out exactly the same numerical calculation as in Section 4 using the Gierer\u2013\nMeinhardt type reaction-diffusion system. We undertook one-dimensional simula-\ntions on a domain of size 2\u03c0 with periodic boundary conditions. Initial conditions\nin each case are random white noise about the equilibrium point (A.1) and the\nmagnitude of initial white noise is of order 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22123. From appendix it is pre-\ndicted that increasing k2 or k3 results in the earlier appearance of the pattern while\nincreasing k1 or k4 results in later appearance of the pattern. The effect of k5 should\ndepend on the parameter set. To confirm this, we calculated the time evolution of\nthe pattern of the control system and \u2018experimentally treated\u2019 system where one\nof these five parameters is increased by 10%, and automatically detected the time\nrequired for the pattern amplitude to reach the pattern detection threshold, which\nis set to 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22121. The results, shown in Fig. 7, are consistent with the analytical\npredictions.\nFrom the above analytical results, that involving k1 is of special interest for us\nbecause it represents the base production of the activator and increasing k1 should\nresult in higher final activator concentration. However, the analytical result showed\nthat increasing k1 results in a slowing down of the pattern appearance speed. There-\nfore, decreasing k1 will both explain promoted lateral inhibition and earlier pattern\nappearance. To see whether this is the case we undertook numerical calculation to\nassay both initial pattern appearance speed and final concentration of u. We first\nset (k1, k2, k3, k4, k5, du, dv) = (0.1, 0.3, 0.2, 0.4, 0.7, 0.02, 0.8), and changed k1\nfrom 0.3 to 0.0 and compared the results. Fig. 8 shows that in the initial phase\nof morphogenesis the case with k1 = 0.0 forms the pattern much earlier than the\nk1 = 0.3 case, but finally the activator concentration in the latter attains a higher\nvalue on average. To show this is not a special case caused by specific initial con-\nditions, we again carried out 40 simulations with different white noise initial con-\nditions. The time required to detect the pattern is significantly shorter and average\nu (activator) concentration is statistically lower under low k1.\nTuring Pattern Appearance Speed 641\nControl k1 k2 k3 k4 k5 Control k1 k2 k3 k4 k5\nTi\nm\ne \nre\nqu\nire\nd \nto\n d\net\nec\nt p\nat\nte\nrn\nTi\nm\ne \nre\nqu\nire\nd \nto\n d\net\nec\nt p\nat\nte\nrn\nChanged parameter Changed parameter\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nAnalytical prediction\nSimulation result\n*\n**\nPattern appears earlier, p < 0.01 \nPattern appears later, p < 0.01 \n** **\n* *\n*\n**\n*\n*\n**\n**\n(a) (b)\nFigure 7.

The time required to detect the pattern by varying a specific parameter is ana-\nlytically predicted and shown next to the numerically obtained value.\n6. DISCUSSION\nIn the present study, we mathematically analyzed how the speed of pattern appe-\narance in the very early phase of pattern formation is affected by modification of\nspecific linear terms of the reaction-diffusion system, and confirmed the analyti-\ncal prediction using numerical simulation. In summary, in the activator\u2013inhibitor\nscheme, increasing fu or fv causes earlier appearance of the pattern and increasing\ngu or gv results in delay of pattern emergence. In the substrate depletion scheme\n(cross-type reaction-diffusion system), increasing fu or gu results in earlier appear-\nance of the pattern, while increasing fv or gv results in later appearance of the pat-\ntern. In both reaction types, increasing du results in later appearance and increasing\ndv results in earlier appearance of the pattern.\nWe have to be careful when using \u03bbmax as a measure of pattern appearance speed\nbecause in some cases the boundary condition can affect the result. For example,\nin the case when the wavelength of the pattern is similar to the length of the spa-\ntial domain, boundary conditions may restrict admissible wavenumbers to values\nwhich are away from the peak of the dispersion relation. In that case we have\n642 T. Miura and P. K.

A total of 40 numerical simulations for each parameter set\nwere carried out with different random initial distribution. We set the magnitude of the\nrandom noise to be of order 1.0\u00d7 10\u22123. The time required for the amplitude of the pattern\nto reach the pattern detection threshold (which we set to 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22121, considerably smaller\nthan the final amplitude of pattern) is automatically detected. A statistically significant dif-\nference is detected between control and treated groups (Student t-test) and the direction of\ndifference is identical to the mathematical prediction in appendix. (d) Statistical analysis\nof the average concentration of u. A statistically significant difference is detected between\ncontrol and treated groups (Student t-test).\nto differentiate (10) for k constant to see whether the pattern at the admissible\nwavenumbers will appear earlier or later. Interestingly, it is possible to decide the\nsign of \u2202\u03bb\/\u2202 fu, \u2202\u03bb\/\u2202 fv, \u2202\u03bb\/\u2202gu, \u2202\u03bb\/\u2202gv, \u2202\u03bb\/\u2202du, \u2202\u03bb\/\u2202dv in all k, which means\nthat by modifying one specific linear parameter the dispersion relation curve sim-\nply goes up or down and no intersection of two dispersion relation curves occurs.\nThis is not true when we modify two or more parameters simultaneously, where\nintersection can happen.\nTuring Pattern Appearance Speed 643\nThe result of the mathematical analysis in the activator\u2013inhibitor scheme can be\ndescriptively explained as follows: for the rate of initial pattern appearance, a posi-\ntive feedback loop of activator is crucially important. So a change that reinforces\nthe positive feedback loop results in the earlier appearance of the pattern, and a\nchange that suppresses the positive feedback loop results in the later appearance of\nthe pattern. For diffusion coefficients, faster activator diffusion coefficient blocks\nthe activator positive feedback because diffusion is inhibitory for peak formation.\nA larger inhibitor diffusion coefficient results in the suppression of inhibitor peaks\nat the same places as activator peaks, which reinforces the activator positive feed-\nback loop. Therefore increasing du results in later pattern appearance and increas-\ning dv results in earlier appearance of the pattern. Concerning our original question,\nin the activator\u2013inhibitor scheme there is no parameter range in which a single lin-\near parameter change results in both a reinforcing of the lateral inhibitory effect\nand the earlier appearance of the pattern.\nHowever, analysis of the Gierer\u2013Meinhardt model shows that a single parameter\nchange does result in both a reinforcing of the lateral inhibitory effect and earlier\nappearance of the pattern. In this model, decreasing k1, which means decreasing\nthe basal production of activator and hence a relative reinforcement of the lateral\ninhibitory effect, will always result in the speeding up of pattern appearance. This\nseems to be counterintuitive at first, but the qualitative explanation of this phe-\nnomenon is as follows: when we increase k1, we increase the equilibrium concen-\ntration. The positive feedback reaction of the activator nears saturation and results\nin decreased fu around the equilibrium point. In this case, the average of u is\nincreased while the amplitude of spatial u distribution is decreased, which results\nin higher u concentration at the \u2018valley\u2019 of the pattern but not at the peak. If we\nassume the concentration of u corresponds to chondrogenic differentiation, this is\nexactly what is happening in the actual experimental system (Fig. 1). It is impor-\ntant to note that the term \u2018more differentiated\u2019 from an experimental point of view\ncan mean, from a theoretical interpretation, either an increase in amplitude of the\nmorphogen concentration and\/or an upward shift in its baseline value.\nObviously we have to keep in mind that there are other interpretations for the\nexperimental and analytical results. The experimental result may simply reflect the\nexistence of two independent mechanisms\u2014periodic pattern formation and pattern\nformation speed\u2014and FGF might affect both of them. Previous hypotheses suggest\nthat pattern formation occurs only in the progress zone (Newman and Frisch, 1979),\nand FGF might play a role in enabling the reaction-diffusion system there. And the\nabove analysis does not suggest that k1 in the Gierer\u2013Meinhardt system is the only\ncandidate for the FGF effect. If we use different models some parameters may play\nthe same role. For example, if we add a constant term in the first equation of (3) it\nmay work the same as k1.\nAnalysis of how changes in du and dv affect model predictions can be useful\nin determining how the diffusion term arises in actual experimental systems. The\nmolecular nature of the activator and inhibitor remains to be elucidated and it is not\n644 T. Miura and P. K. Maini\ncertain whether the \u2018diffusion\u2019 term in the reaction-diffusion model actually reflects\ndiffusion of some secretory molecules. For example, this could be achieved by the\nrandom motion of cells, which is actually observed in experimental systems we\nare currently considering (Miura et al., 2000). Since the diffusion coefficient of\nactivator and inhibitor should be considerably different to form a stable pattern,\nit is possible that these diffusion terms are implemented by completely different\nmechanisms in actual biological systems. So if random cell movement is involved\nfor one of the diffusion terms, suppressing cell movement by altering the rate of cell\nmovement by modifying adhesion between cell and extracellular matrix (Delannet\net al., 1994) can result in either earlier or later appearance of the pattern. Thus we\ncould distinguish whether random cell movement is involved in the diffusion term\nof activator or inhibitor by observing the time course of the formation of the pattern.\nThe limb bud micromass culture system is a promising system to elucidate the\nunderlying mechanisms of periodic pattern formation in biological systems. The\ncells form a two-dimensional chondrogenic pattern, and they show various mor-\nphological properties which can be experimentally manipulated. For example, we\ncan modify the wavenumber of the pattern (Miura and Shiota, 2000a; Miura et al.,\n2000), or speed of appearance of the pattern as described above. The culture system\nalso exhibits stripe-spot transitions using retinoic acid (data not shown), which can\nbe mathematically explained using nonlinear analysis (Ermentrout, 1991; Lyons\nand Harrison, 1992).

(A.2)\nIf we substitute (A.2) into (16), we obtain\n\u03bbmax = duk5(k3k5 + k1k4) \u2212 dvk2(k3k5 \u2212 k1k4) \u2212 2k5\n\u221a\n2dudvk2k3(k3k5 + k1k4)\n(dv \u2212 du)(k3k5 + k1k4) .(A.3)\nA.1. Diffusion-driven instability condition in the Gierer\u2013Meinhardt model. From\n(4) we can obtain the following inequalities for diffusion-driven instability:\nk3k5(k2 \u2212 k5) \u2212 k1k4(k2 + k5) < 0 (A.4)\ndvk2(k3k5 \u2212 k1k4) > duk5(k3k5 + k1k4) > 0 (A.5)\nd2v k22(k3k5 \u2212 k1k4)2 + d2u k25(k3k5 + k1k4)2\n\u2212 2dudvk2k5(k3k5 + k1k4)(3k3k5 + k1k4) > 0. (A.6)\nA.2. Varying k1. By simple calculation we obtain\n\u2202\u03bbmax\n\u2202k1\n= \u22122dvk2k3k4k5 + k4k5\n\u221a\n2dudvk2k3(k3k5 + k1k4)\n(dv \u2212 du)(k3k5 + k1k4)2 . (A.7)\ndv > du > 0, so the denominator is positive. The first term of the numerator is\nnegative and the second term is positive, so the sign of the numerator should be\nidentical to(\n\u22122dvk2k3k4k5 + k4k5\n\u221a\n2dudvk2k3(k3k5 + k1k4)\n)\n\u00d7\n(\n2dvk2k3k4k5 + k4k5\n\u221a\n2dudvk2k3(k3k5 + k1k4)\n)\n= 2dvk2k3k24k5(duk5(k3k5 + k1k4) \u2212 2dvk2k3k5)\n< 2dvk2k3k24k5(dvk2(k3k5 \u2212 k1k4) \u2212 2dvk2k3k5) [From (A.5)]\n= 2dvk2k3k24k5(\u2212dvk2k3k5 \u2212 dvk1k2k4) < 0. (A.8)\nTherefore increasing k1 always decreases the appearance speed.\n646 T. Miura and P. K. Maini\nA.3. Varying k2. By simple calculation we obtain\n\u2202\u03bbmax\n\u2202k2\n= dvk2(k3k5 \u2212 k1k4) \u2212 k5\n\u221a\n2dudvk2k3(k3k5 + k1k4)\n(dv \u2212 du)k2(k3k5 + k1k4) . (A.9)\ndv > du > 0, so the denominator is positive. So the sign of the value is identical to\ndvk2(k3k5 \u2212 k1k4) \u2212 k5\n\u221a\n2dudvk2k3(k3k5 + k1k4). (A.10)\nFrom (A.5), dvk2(k3k5 \u2212 k1k4) > 0. So the first term of this expression is positive\nand the second term is negative. Therefore, the sign of this expression is identical\nto\n(\ndvk2(k3k5 \u2212 k1k4) \u2212 k5\n\u221a\n2dudvk2k3(k3k5 + k1k4)\n)\n\u00d7\n(\ndvk2(k3k5 \u2212 k1k4) + k5\n\u221a\n2dudvk2k3(k3k5 + k1k4)\n)\n= d2v k22(k3k5 \u2212 k1k4)2 \u2212 2dudvk2k3k52(k3k5 + k1k4)\n> \u2212(du2k5(k3k5 + k1k4)2 \u2212 2dudvk2k5(k3k5 + k1k4)(3k3k5 + k1k4))\n\u2212 2dudvk2k3k25(k3k5 + k1k4) [From (A.6)]\n= \u2212duk5(k3k5 + k1k4)(duk5(k3k5 + k1k4) \u2212 2dvk2(2k3k5 + k1k4))\n> \u2212duk5(k3k5 + k1k4)(dvk2(k3k5 \u2212 k1k4) \u2212 2dvk2(2k3k5 + k1k4))\n[From (A.5)]\n= 3dudvk2k5(k3k5 + k1k4)(k3k5 + k1k4)\n> 0. (A.11)\nTherefore \u2202\u03bbmax\/\u2202k2 is always positive and increasing k2 always increases the pat-\ntern appearance speed.\nA.4. Varying k3. By simple calculation we obtain\n\u2202\u03bbmax\n\u2202k3\n= k1k4\n(\n2dvk2k3k5 \u2212 k5\u221a2dudvk2k3(k3k5 + k1k4)\n)\n(dv \u2212 du)k3(k3k5 + k1k4)2 . (A.12)\nFrom dv > du , the denominator is positive. So the sign of this value is identical to\n2dvk2k3k5 \u2212 k5\n\u221a\n2dudvk2k3(k3k5 + k1k4). (A.13)\nTuring Pattern Appearance Speed 647\nThe first term of this expression is positive and the second term is negative. So\nthe sign of this expression is identical to\n(\n2dvk2k3k5 \u2212 k5\n\u221a\n2dudvk2k3(k3k5 + k1k4)\n)\n\u00d7\n(\n2dvk2k3k5 + k5\n\u221a\n2dudvk2k3(k3k5 + k1k4)\n)\n= 2dvk2k3k5(2dvk2k3k5 \u2212 duk5(k3k5 + k1k4))\n> 2dvk2k3k5(2dvk2k3k5 \u2212 dvk2(k3k5 \u2212 k1k4)) [From (A.5)]\n= 2d2v k22k3k5(k3k5 + k1k4)\n> 0. (A.14)\nTherefore \u2202\u03bbmax\/\u2202k3 is always positive and increasing k3 always increases the pat-\ntern appearance speed.\nA.5. Varying k4.\n\u2202\u03bbmax\n\u2202k4\n= \u22122dvk1k2k3k5 + k1k5\n\u221a\n2dudvk2k3(k3k5 + k1k4)\n(dv \u2212 du)(k3k5 + k1k4)2 . (A.15)\nThe denominator is positive (dv > du), and the first term of the numerator is\nnegative and the second term is positive. So the sign of this expression is identical\nto\n(\n\u22122dvk1k2k3k5 + k1k5\n\u221a\n2dudvk2k3(k3k5 + k1k4)\n)\n\u00d7\n(\n2dvk1k2k3k5 + k1k5\n\u221a\n2dudvk2k3(k3k5 + k1k4)\n)\n= 2dvk21k2k3k5(\u22122dvk2k3k5 + duk5(k3k5 + k1k4))\n< 2dvk21k2k3k5(\u22122dvk2k3k5 + dvk2(k3k5 \u2212 k1k4)) [From (A.5)]\n= \u22122d2v k21k22k3k5(k3k5 + k1k4) < 0. (A.16)\nTherefore \u2202\u03bbmax\/\u2202k4 is always negative and increasing k4 always decreases the\npattern appearance speed.\nA.6. Varying k5.\n\u2202\u03bbmax\n\u2202k5\n= (2dvk1k2k3k4 + du(k3k5 + k1k4)\n2) \u2212 (2k1k4 + k3k5)\u221a2dudvk2k3(k3k5 + k1k4)\n(dv \u2212 du)(k3k5 + k1k4)2 .(A.17)\n648 T. Miura and P. K. Maini\nWe cannot determine easily the sign of this expression. For example, when (k1,\nk2, k3, k4, k5, du, dv)= (0.5, 1.0, 0.9, 0.4, 0.9, 0.01, 0.2), \u2202\u03bbmax\/\u2202k5 = 0.0476677\n> 0. However, when (k1, k2, k3, k4, k5, du, dv)= (0.3, 0.4, 0.8, 0.1, 0.6, 0.02, 0.4),\n\u2202\u03bbmax\/\u2202k5 = \u22120.148849 < 0. Both of the parameter sets satisfy the diffusion-\ndriven instability conditions.\nREFERENCES\nDelannet, M., F. Martin, B. Bossy, D. A. Cheresh, L. F. Reichardt and J. L.
