Therefore, it is \nessential that reliable descriptions and models of the interaction between projectile and target be \ndeveloped.  Armour-piercing (AP) projectiles often possess cemented tungsten carbide \ncermet\/hardmetal cores (often with a Ni or Co binder) due to their ability to defeat ceramic-faced \narmours where steel-cored projectiles would normally fail [1,2].  Various small and medium-\ncalibre rounds which possess WC-Co cermet cores such as the 7.62-mm AP sniper 9 [3] and \n14.5-mm AP BS-41 [4] rounds are available and present significant challenges to armour \ndesigners due to their high hardness values and high acoustic impedance.  Unfortunately, limited \ninformation is available concerning the dynamic material properties of the projectiles and their \nfailure mechanisms. In particular there is a paucity of data on this material\u2019s impact response that \ncan serve as validation for numerical models.  \nMuch of the data in the literature concerning the dynamic properties of WC-Co has been \nderived from plate-impact tests.  For example, the dynamic response of both 3-4 wt.% Ni WC-Ni \ncomposites extracted from a 14.5mm BS-41 AP round and 5.7 wt.% Co WC-Co from \nKennemetal Inc. was investigated in [4]. More recently, Appleby-Thomas et al. [5] investigated \nthe dynamic behaviour of a Co-based composite and showed that the Hugoniot Elastic Limit, \nthat is the dynamic strength under 1-D loading conditions, was 3.3 \u00b1 0.2 GPa. Further, a tensile \nspall strength for this material of 4.38 GPa was measured. \nWhereas plate-impact experiments primarily provide dynamic material property \ninformation, sphere impact tests provide an opportunity to study both ballistic properties and \nmaterial fragmentation.  Sphere impact tests involving WC-Co projectiles have been conducted \nin the velocity ranges 0.8 - 2.5 km\/s and 2.1 - 4.1 km\/s in [6] and [4,7] respectively.  Martineau \net al. [6] focused on crater formation in relatively ductile High Strength Low Alloy (HSLA-100) \nsteel targets.  Impact crater dimensions were directly measured by sectioning target plates and \nwere found to be in good agreement with numerical models based on measured HSLA-100 \nproperties and an elastic-perfectly-plastic WC-Co material model. However, as details of the \nsphere\u2019s fragmentation were not reported in this paper, there is little we can glean from the \nfailure kinetics of the sphere. More enlightening was the work of  Hertel, Jr. and Grady [7] who \nMaterials Science and Engineering A: 527 (29-30), pp. 7638-7645 (2010) \n3 \n \nused flash X-ray equipment to study the fragmentation of WC-Co spheres during impact on both \nPMMA and glass targets.  Fragmentation initially comprised the separation of spall segments \nfrom the front and rear of the spherical projectiles, although as the impact velocity increased so \ndid the degree and homogeneity of projectile comminution as shock energy became more \nuniformly distributed throughout the projectile.  Both axial and radial fragment expansion \nvelocities were used to try and quantify energy dissipation.  In the case of impact on PMMA, \naxial expansion was found to be independent of impact velocity.  However, the expansion \nvelocity of radial fragments scaled linearly with impact velocity.  Extrapolation of the \nrelationship between radial fragment velocity and projectile impact velocity implied that radial \nexpansion commenced for impact velocities above a threshold of ca. 2.4 km\/s. \nSpherical indentation techniques are able to produce damage similar to that caused by \nballistic impact \u2013 e.g., combinations of ring\/cone cracking, elastic-plastic behaviour and \nmeridian cracking. A body of work using WC-Co projectiles or indenters for spherical impact or \nindentation tests exists [4,6-9] but to the authors\u2019 knowledge no information on complimentary \nWC-Co impacts \u2013 namely those involving WC-Co projectiles impacting WC-Co targets \u2013 exists \nin the literature. These types of experiments are important for two reasons. Firstly: the impact \npressure in the projectile and the target are similar due to the similar elastic and shock impedance \nproperties and secondly, numerical simulations are some-what simplified due to the analysis of a \nsingle target and projectile material. \nIn this work, the impact of WC-Co spheres with a microstructure similar to that of \narmour-piercing cores against a target with a similar binder system is presented.   Experiments \nwere performed in the impact velocity regime 28 \u2013 484 m\/s.  The impact event and subsequent \ndamage evolution were observed using a high-speed video camera system (a Phantom v.7 \ncamera). Furthermore, a model has been developed within ANSYS AUTODYN\u2122 to elucidate \nsome for the failure modes that occur when a tungsten-carbide projectile strikes a tungsten-\ncarbide target. \n \n \n \n \n \nMaterials Science and Engineering A: 527 (29-30), pp. 7638-7645 (2010) \n4 \n \n2.0 Experimental \n \n2.1 Materials used \n \nThe WC-Co discs were supplied by Kennametal Engineered Products B.V.

Table I outlines the material properties for the two grades \nof WC-Co and ballistic-test backing material used in these experiments. The elastic properties \nfor the discs were taken from [5] whereas the properties for the polycarbonate were from [10]. \nThe hardness, HV[2.0], of each grade of tungsten carbide was measured using a HWDM-7 \nmicro-hardness testing machine; resultant values are shown in Table I with a standard deviation \ncalculated from 10 measurements.  \n \nTABLE I.

Both WC-Co grades considered exhibited a \ntypical hardmetal microstructure showing a bi-modal WC crystallite distribution with fractions in \nthe 5-10 \u03bcm and <5 \u03bcm ranges.  Image analysis showed that (on average) the larger WC bimodal \ngrain fraction had a larger grain size in the G13 WC-Co at 6.2 \u03bcm compared to <5 \u03bcm for the \nWC-Co sphere. \n \nMaterials Science and Engineering A: 527 (29-30), pp. 7638-7645 (2010) \n5 \n \nFigure 1: Cross-sectional backscattered scanning electron micrographs of the WC-Co specimens: (a) G13 \ntarget discs and; (b) spherical projectiles. \n \n2.2 Ballistic technique \n \nThe sphere impact tests involved ballistic impact of \u220512-mm WC-Co projectiles onto \u220565 mm \n\u00d7 6.35 mm thick G13 WC-Co discs mounted on 150 mm \u00d7 150 mm, 12 mm thick, polycarbonate \nbacking using ca. 0.25 mm thick layers of slow cure epoxy, Araldite 2015.  This arrangement is \nshown schematically in Figure 2. \n \nFigure 2: Schematic illustration of the sphere impact experimental arrangement. \n \nBoth the moment of impact and post-impact behaviour were interrogated using a Phantom v.7 \nhigh-speed video camera operating at 38,000 \u2013 42,000 pictures-per-second with a 2 \u03bcs exposure.  \nIn addition, projectile\/target fragments were recovered and subsequently analysed to provide \nfurther insight into the WC-Co failure mechanisms.  The sphere impact tests were carried out \nusing two smooth bore single-stage gas-guns: (1) a \u220530-mm, 5-m barrel gun, and; (2) a \u220522-\nmm, 1.5-m barrel, gun. \n \n2.3 Modelling technique \n \nTo elucidate the mechanisms of penetration we have conducted a series of computations. All \ncomputations were carried out using 2D axial symmetry employing a Lagrangian mesh in the \nexplicit non-linear transient dynamic numerical code - AUTODYN-2D. This software is \nexplained in detail elsewhere [11] and a useful overview of these types of codes is provided by \nAnderson [12]. However in brief, this code solves the conservations laws of mass and \nmomentum based on initial boundary conditions. The user is prompted for an equation-of-state \nthat describes the pressure in terms of the internal energy and volume and a constitutive \nrelationship that calculates the flow stress in terms of a number of parameters including strain, \nstrain-rate and temperature. Failure models can be introduced to describe the failure.  \nIt should be pointed out that modelling brittle materials such as tungsten carbide is \nparticularly troublesome as there is no experimental data available for the strength of the \nMaterials Science and Engineering A: 527 (29-30), pp. 7638-7645 (2010) \n6 \n \ncomminuted material. Furthermore, there exists very little data on the dynamic behaviour of \ntungsten carbide. In particular there is little data on the dynamic fracture characteristics that \nwould lead to an appropriate material model.  \nVarious attempts have been made in the past to model the failure of tungsten carbide \nmaterials that have been subjected to dynamic loading. Both Aries et al. [13] and L\u00f3pez Puente \net al. [14] have adopted the approach of Cort\u00e9s et al. [15]. In these works, a model originally \nintended to simulate the failure of ceramics has been used. This involves the use of a pressure \ndependent yield surface and the evolution of damage that is associated with ceramic \nfragmentation through a calculated scalar damage parameter. In both cases they were modelling \nthe penetration into a ceramic-faced composite armour using the LAPUA 7.62 mm armour-\npiercing bullet. \nHolmquist et al.  [16] adopted the approach of using both the Johnson-Cook fracture \nmodel [17] and a simple principal stress failure model for modelling the penetration of a tungsten \ncarbide \u2013cored projectile through a range of target materials. They concluded that the Johnson-\nCook fracture model was the best at representing the failure of the core. Their results showed \ngood correlation of a 14.5 mm BS41 surrogate projectile penetrating monolithic and layered \ntargets \u2013 including a ceramic-faced armour. Their material model for the tungsten carbide was \nbased on a material with a 5.7% Co content that possessed a uniaxial compressive strength of 5.9 \nGPa. On the other hand, more recently Fountzoulas et al. [18] modelled the penetration of a \nHigh-Strength-Low-Alloy (HSLA)-100 steel plate by high velocity WC-Co projectile. They \nfound that, in AUTODYN at least, the Johnson-Cook strength and failure model used by \nHolmquist et al. in [16] produced disappointing results. Consequently they went on to evaluate \ntwo additional models: the Grady spall criterion [19] that was originally developed to predict \nspall in ductile metals and a simple principal strain failure model with crack softening and \nstochastic failure. However their work showed that none of the WC-Co failure models were well \ncalibrated for impact velocities over the velocity range of 830 \u2013 2550 m\/s. As the authors pointed \nout, the fragmentation behaviour of WC-Co is notably complex on dynamic loading. \nConsequently, we have taken a relatively simple approach to simulate the impact \nbehaviour and have adopted the strength model as used by Holmquist et al. given by: \n \nn\npBA \u03b5\u03c3 +=       (1) \nMaterials Science and Engineering A: 527 (29-30), pp. 7638-7645 (2010) \n7 \n \nwhere  A  is the yield strength at zero plastic strain, B is the strain hardening parameter \nand n is the strain hardening exponent. Our initial values were A = 3.00 GPa, B = 89 MPa and n  \n= 0.65. From the results of the sphere-impact work we have assumed that the strain-rate \nhardening effects of the tungsten carbide are negligible in comparison to the strain-hardening \neffects and consequently they have been ignored.  \nThe polycarbonate data was extracted from the AUTODYN\u2122 material library [20]. This \ndata was derived from [21]. The strain-rate strengthening behaviour was calculated according to \nEquation 1 with C = 0.040 where C represents a strain-rate multiplier as defined in [17]. Failure \noccurred when the effective plastic strain reached 200%. \nThe equation of state for polycarbonate and the tungsten carbide was of Mie-Gr\u00fcneisen \nform [22] derived from a linear shock-particle Hugoniot thus: \n \n     ps u.ScU += 0      (2) \n \nwhere Us and up are the shock and particle velocities respectively, c0  is the bulk sound speed and \nS is the slope in the Us versus up Hugoniot. A Gr\u00fcneisen coefficient (\u0393) is provided to calculate \noff-Hugoniot shock states [22]. Equation-of-state data is provided in Table II. \n \nTable II: Equation-of-state data for materials used. \nMaterial c0 (mm\/\u03bcs) S \u0393 \nWC-Co 5.253 1.11 1.05 \nPolycarbonate 1.933 2.65 0.61 \n \n \n3.0 Results and Discussion \n \n3.1 Projectile defeat \n \nSphere impact tests using the \u220512-mm WC-Co projectile were carried out at velocities \nranging from 28 m\/s to 484 m\/s. On contact, material was radially dispersed across the surface of \nthe target. This occurred via two different forms: (a) comminuted projectile material travelling at \nMaterials Science and Engineering A: 527 (29-30), pp. 7638-7645 (2010) \n8 \n \nvelocities in excess of the impact velocity and; (b) larger fragments (ca. 1 mm) moving at a \nvelocity less than the impact velocity. \nFigure 3 shows an example of the early stages of impact where the projectile is travelling \nat 220 m\/s. On contact, fast-moving material is seen to emanate radially from the point of \nimpact, in this case, with a measured velocity of ca. 620 m\/s. Occasionally however, this fast \nmoving material was not visible due to the presence of an incandescent flash as seen in Figure 4, \na phenomenon that may well have been due to the small comminuted particles igniting on \nimpact. \n \nFigure 3: Initial stages of impact and projectile failure; impact velocity = 220 m\/s. \n \nFigure 4 shows a typical sequence of high-speed video images from the 195 m\/s test.  A small \npart of the acetal sabot is also visible in the frame but had no effect on penetration. Before failure \nof the target disc, the projectile is observed to fracture and spread radially across the target \nsurface. This is similar to the process of interface-defeat that has been observed with projectiles \nstriking ceramic targets and occurs when the projectile is eroded whilst there is no significant \npenetration into the target [23]. This was observed for all shots with a velocity of less than 484 \nm\/s. \n \nFigure 4: Phantom high-speed video showing a \u00d8 12-mm WC-Co sphere impacting a WC-Co disc mounted \non polycarbonate backing; impact velocity = 195 m\/s. \n \nThe radial velocity of the larger, slower-moving fragments was measured for each of the \nexperiments as they appeared to flow on the front surface of the target. Figure 5 shows the \nvariation of fragment radial velocity with impact velocity. There are several things to note from \nthese measurements. Firstly, impacting the target at 28 m\/s resulted in no fragmentation of the \nsphere (and indeed no permanent deformation) and therefore represented the lower limit of this \nbehaviour. Increasing the velocity to 57 m\/s resulted in chips fracturing off the front of the \nprojectile with the predominate mass of the projectile rebounded from the target. Rebounding of \nthe projectile fragments was observed until an impact velocity of 137 m\/s where the projectile \nfragmented and dispersed radially across the target\u2019s surface. Secondly, the radial velocity \nappeared to scale linearly with impact velocity up to 281 m\/s. This is consistent with the \nconservation of momentum of a projectile impacting and fragmenting against a rigid non-\nMaterials Science and Engineering A: 527 (29-30), pp. 7638-7645 (2010) \n9 \n \ndeforming plate where all of the projectile\u2019s momentum is projected radially. Thirdly and finally, \nat velocities in excess of 281 m\/s, the radial velocity appeared to become constant. This may \nhave been due to the fact that it was particularly difficult to discern the main fragmented front \ndue to the impact flash. On the other hand, it might suggest that we no longer observed increased \nradial flow but rather penetration ensued. Indeed, for the target that was struck at 484 m\/s, little-\nto-no radial movement of projectile fragments was observed. Further, on analysis of the \npolycarbonate back-plate, a circular indentation was present with a diameter that was similar to \nthe projectile suggesting that the projectile had remained intact long enough to impact the back-\nplate. \nFigure 5: Variation of radial fragment velocity with impact velocity. \n \nFollowing each test the majority of fragments of both the projectile and target were \nrecovered and partially reconstructed. In general, the outer regions of the targets survived while \nthe central impact sections were comminuted to varying degrees.  The WC-Co targets failed via a \nseries of radial cracks bisected by concentric cracks presumably arising from hoop stresses.  The \n195-m\/s test was repeated with the high-speed camera angled at 24\u00b0 to the target surface to allow \nfurther investigation of this failure mode.  A series of frames from the resultant high-speed video \nare shown in Figure 6.  Here, the radial cracks began to form within 47 \u03bcs after impact and \ncontinued evolving as dwell occurred.  Subsequently when the surface strength of the target was \novercome, fracture into numerous radial segments occurred. \n \nFigure 6: Phantom high-speed video showing a \u00d8 12-mm WC-Co sphere impacting a WC-Co disc mounted \non polycarbonate backing; impact velocity = 195 m\/s; observation angle 24\u00b0. \n \n3.2 Fracture morphology \n \nThe morphology of the recovered projectile material was studied to provide further \ninsight into the fracture behavior of WC-Co.  Previous work on the fracture of brittle \nparticles\/projectiles has largely focused on either: the statistics of fragment distribution via \nwitness-plate and finite element modelling techniques [24,25], or; fragmentation of glass \nparticles, e.g. [26-28].  The mode of fracture has been linked to the velocity of impact.   \nMaterials Science and Engineering A: 527 (29-30), pp. 7638-7645 (2010) \n10 \n \nFragment morphology was observed to change with impact velocity and was investigated \nfor impact velocities of \u2265137 m\/s which represented the lower-bound of projectile failure and \nflow across the surface of the target.   The degree of comminution of the projectile increased \nwith increasing impact velocity.  Consequently, the total proportion of projectile material \nrecovered decreased in a linear fashion from ca. 50% at 137 m\/s to ca. 7% at 484 m\/s.  Projectile \nfragments generally comprised: (1) small, 1-2 mm surface chips; (2) larger, 2 mm+ conical \nfragments, and; (3) at higher impact velocities a central crushed cone representative of the point \nof impact.  At 137 m\/s segments ranging in size from 1-8 mm were recovered.  All fragments \nwere conical, with the smaller 1-2 mm fragments appearing to represent material detached from \nthe sphere\u2019s surface.  Similar detached surface fragments formed during the fracture of glass \nspheres have been attributed to the interaction of Hertzian ring and cone cracks [26].  Counter-\nintuitively the more finely comminuted material was likely to have originated from the rear of \nthe projectile.  This was evidenced by the fact that at 195-484 m\/s the impact face of the target \nwas recovered in the form of a flattened cone of WC-Co.  Up to 281 m\/s smaller fragments again \nappeared to represent chips from the surface of the sphere. However at an impact velocity of 339 \nm\/s no fragments smaller than 2 mm were recovered and at 484 m\/s only the flattened central \ncone was present.  Consequently it was supposed that comminution behind the impact face \nbecame so great that all material from this region was lost.   \nFragments from the impact zone of the WC-Co disc targets were also recovered, as \ntypified by the crater shown in Figure 7(a).  Several of these exhibited either complete or partial \nelements of plastic deformation at the point of impact.  Additionally, in several cases a Hertzian \ncone from behind the point of impact was recovered either separately or still adhered to the \npolycarbonate backing.   \n \nFigure 7: Examples of recovered central G13 WC-Co target material, impact velocity =195 m\/s. \n \n3.3 Inelastic deformation \n \nFigure 7(a) shows a typical recovered impact crater (shown with an intact 12 mm projectile in-\nsitu for scale in Figure 7 (b)), complete with crater lip, formed when a WC-Co projectile \nimpacted a target WC-Co disc at 195 m\/s.  It is interesting to note the inelastic nature of this \nimpact, as compared to the brittle failure observed in tungsten carbide core-on-core impacts [29]. \nMaterials Science and Engineering A: 527 (29-30), pp. 7638-7645 (2010) \n11 \n \nIn line with impact on other brittle materials [26, 30], the impact of the WC-Co sphere appears to \nhave led to the formation of surface ring cracks with the subsequent symmetric hoop stresses \nleading to the formation of a typical Hertzian cone.  Recovery or reconstruction of the plastically \ndeformed impact zones proved possible for impact velocities up to 317 m\/s.  In the other cases, \ntarget comminution proved too great for more than a partial recovery of the impact region. \nWhere the point of impact was retrieved with sufficient features remaining for analysis, we \nestablished an \u2018equivalent DoP\u2019. Firstly, the diameter of the crater was accurately measured.  The \ndepth was then estimated geometrically from Pythagoras according to Equation 3 assuming that \nthe penetration cavity was spherical in shape. \n \n2\n2\n2\n\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\u2212\u2212= wrrd p        (3) \n \nwhere, dP is the depth of penetration, r is the radius of the indenting sphere and w the measured \ndiameter of the indentation. To compare with this data, where possible the maximum depth of \nthe impression was measured using a dial-test-indicator accurate to 2 \u00b5m per division for shallow \nindentations and 10 \u00b5m per division for the deeper indentations. This data is plotted against \nimpact velocity in Figure 8.  \n At low impact velocities (ca. 57 m\/s), the difference between the calculated depth \n(assuming a spherical indentation) and the measured depth was relatively small, however the \ndifference appeared to grow as the impact velocity was increased. This was mostly due to the \nelastic-plastic deformation in the projectile and the target. However, for the 28 m\/s impact-case \nno permanent deformation was measured in the recovered tungsten carbide sphere whereas an \nindentation of diameter of 2.61 mm and depth of 0.034 mm was measured in the target; the \ncalculated equivalent DoP was 0.14 mm.  As the calculated DoP assumed a spherical impression, \nthe difference observed between the measured and calculated values is attributed to the elasticity \nof the sphere and target. \nUp to an impact velocity of 137 m\/s, failure of the projectile was noted to occur on \nrebound. At ca. 195 m\/s, there was a noticeably sharp increase in the depth-of-penetration. We \nattribute this to an abrupt increase in the level of cracking below the contact surface. Indeed, \nexamination of scanning electron micrographs of the fracture surfaces around the impact crater \nMaterials Science and Engineering A: 527 (29-30), pp. 7638-7645 (2010) \n12 \n \nrevealed extensive inter-granular and trans-granular cracking at impact velocities of 220 m\/s and \ngreater (see Figure 9). No such level of cracking was noticeable at impact velocities of less than \nthis. \n \nFigure 8: Variation of indentation depth with impact velocity. \n \nFigure 9: Scanning electron micrograph showing cracking in material situated just below the impact crater; \nimpact velocity = 220 m\/s. \n \n \n \nThe simulation results using the Holmquist et al. [16] strength model are shown in Figures 10 \nand 11. There are several things to note from these results. Firstly, we found that the results are \nconsistent with the experimental data when the work hardening constant, B, is reduced from 89 \nMPa to 45 MPa for both the projectile and the target. As shown, comparison was also made to \nthe case where the projectile\u2019s work hardening constant was 89 MPa and the target\u2019s 45 MPa \nconsistent with the slightly harder projectile employed (see Table I). Small differences are \napparent in the results \u2013 in particular the penetration becomes narrower and deeper for the harder \nprojectile. It is also noticeable that at lower impact velocities, the penetration depth appears to \nmirror the experimental results until a departure at ca. 200 m\/s. This confirms that initially at \nleast, the penetration depth in these early stages is mostly due to the inelastic deformation of the \nprojectile and the target rather than being affected by the fracturing of the projectile. \nFurthermore, as failure has been suppressed in this model, this lends weight to the fact that \nextensive failure is occurring in the target leading to deeper penetration at impact velocities of \nca. 200 m\/s. \n \nFigure 10: Experimental and numerical evaluation of the diameter of the indentation. \n \nFigure 11: Experimental and numerical evaluation of the indentation depth. \n \n \n3.4 Dynamic hardness assessment \n \nMaterials Science and Engineering A: 527 (29-30), pp. 7638-7645 (2010) \n13 \n \nFor the low velocity impacts where the sphere remains mostly elastic, it is possible to estimate \nthe dynamic hardness of the target due to the size of the indentation. Previous work has focused \non firing tungsten-carbide spheres at metals [3,31]. The calculation of dynamic hardness can be \nmade by a simple energy balance where the kinetic energy of the projectile is consumed by the \ninelastic deformation of the target material. A simplified approach was adopted by Sundararajan \nand Tirupataiah [31] where it was assumed that the dynamic hardness of the material could be \ncalculated from \n \nU\nmv.H d\n250=       (4) \n \nWhere m is the mass of the projectile, v is its velocity and U is the unrelaxed indentation volume. \nU can be computed easily on the basis of the indentation diameter (w) since the unrelaxed \nindentation essentially follows the profile of the sphere used in the experiments. There are a \nnumber of simplifying assumptions that we have made with this approach, namely: (a) the \nspherical indenter remains elastic at all times during the indentation process; (b) energy loss \nthrough stress waves is negligible compared to the incident energy; (c) the target remains rigid \nduring the indentation period and; (d) work-hardening effects are small. \nIt should be pointed out that for impact velocities of 57 m\/s and 83 m\/s fracture was \nobserved in the projectile post impact therefore for these tests it is likely that assumption (a) \nmentioned above is not valid. Nevertheless, given the brittle nature of the projectile, we have \nincluded these results in our analysis. Based on this approach the calculated hardness values for \nthe experiments where rebound of the projectile was visible are shown in Table III. \n \nTable III: Hardness measurements in the tungsten carbide discs. \nImpact velocity (m\/s) HV*\/ Hd (GPa) \n0 14.35* \n28 13.38 \n57 14.96 \n83 14.47 \n \nMaterials Science and Engineering A: 527 (29-30), pp. 7638-7645 (2010) \n14 \n \nAlthough we must be cautious when analyzing these results due to the simplifying \nassumptions that have been made, they do suggest that at the low velocity at least this type of \nmaterial is not sensitive to strain-rate-hardening as has been hinted at by other authors [32]. \nFurther validation of these results is that a simple strain-hardening model is sufficient to predict \nthe diameters of the indentation though a range of impact velocities and strain rates (see Figure \n10). \nFinally, Figure 12 shows a computational result of a tungsten carbide target that has been \nimpacted at 83 m\/s. An image at 1 \u03bcs and 5 \u03bcs after impact has been captured. From this \ncomputation it is possible to establish an estimate of the strain-rate during the indentation \nprocess. For the highest impact velocity cited in Table III, this simulation shows that reasonably \nlarge strain-rates are achieved in the early stages of indentation (103-104\/s). Consequently this \nreinforces the notion that under ballistic impact conditions (where such strain-rates are \ncommonly achieved), the tungsten carbide material remains relatively insensitive to strain rate. \nThis, at least, raises the prospect of simplifying numerical models when simulating the behavior \nof armour-piercing cores penetrating targets. \n \nFigure 12: ANSYS\u2122 AUTODYN simulation result showing the impact of a tungsten carbide disc at 83 m\/s; \neffective-plastic-strain rate at (a) 1 \u03bcs and (b) 5 \u03bcs. \n \n \nConclusions \n \nWhile the tendency for both projectile and target to fracture during complimentary WC-Co \nimpacts hides some detail with regards to the impacts, a number of conclusions may be drawn \nfrom this work: \n1) WC-Co discs of thickness 6.35 mm bonded to a 12 mm thick polycarbonate backing are able \nto defeat similar grade \u220512-mm projectiles at impact velocities up to ca. 280 m\/s (e.g. \nsurface dwell occurred before projectile penetration). \n2) Dwell velocity for spherical impact appears to scale nominally linearly with impact velocity \nuntil a critical velocity is reached beyond which the target WC-Co fails. \n3) WC-Co fails via a combination of radial and concentric cracking under spherical loading, \nforming fragments whose size increases both with distance from the point of impact and with \nMaterials Science and Engineering A: 527 (29-30), pp. 7638-7645 (2010) \n15 \n \nreduced impact velocity. Additionally, Hertzian fracture mechanics appears to apply to \ncomplimentary WC-Co impacts. \n4) Numerical modelling techniques have successfully represented the indentation size and \npredicted the extent of the inelastic deformation. \n5) By an assessment of the dynamic hardness of the tungsten carbide we have shown that this \nmaterial is not strain-rate sensitive and therefore the simulation of tungsten-carbide based \narmour piercing projectiles is somewhat simplified. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThis research has been partly funded by the Dutch Ministry of Defence, through the \nResearch Program \"V518 - Munitions and Weapons Effects\".
