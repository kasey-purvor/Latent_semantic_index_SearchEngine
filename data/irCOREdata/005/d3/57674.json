Mn can 41 \nexist in different oxidation states, but the most widely occurring forms in the environment are 42 \nsoluble Mn (II) when reduced and insoluble Mn (IV) when oxidised. Naturally occurring Mn 43 \nis commonly found in drinking water supplies and is essential for human health at low 44 \nconcentrations (Keen and Zidenberg-Cherr, 1994).  The World Health Organization (WHO) 45 \nhas set a guideline value of 0.4 mg l-1 (WHO, 2008): nevertheless, most countries have set a 46 \nlower limit primarily due to aesthetic and infrastructure problems; e.g. Mn is listed as an 47 \nindicator parameter by the EC at a concentration of 0.05 mg l-1 in drinking water (EC, 1998).  48 \n 49 \nExcessive Mn concentrations can result in metallic tasting water, staining of clothes, dishes, 50 \nand products such as paper or plastics, and reduced water pressure and flow in pipes from 51 \naccumulation of Mn oxides (Sly et al., 1990). Although Mn can be removed from water by 52 \ntreatment (Casale et al., 2002), this is expensive and water supply infrastructure prior to 53 \ntreatment, such as pipes, pumps and boreholes, may still be adversely affected by build up of 54 \nMn oxides (Sly et al., 1990). Hence if the occurrence of excessive Mn concentrations can be 55 \npredicted, it could be avoided when sourcing new water supplies. 56 \n 57 \nFurthermore, several studies in different environmental settings have reported significant 58 \nassociations between exposure to Mn in groundwater-sourced drinking water supplies and 59 \nadverse human health effects. For example, Wasserman et al. (2006) identified a significant 60 \nnegative relationship between well water Mn concentration (0.004-3.91 mg l-1) and measures 61 \nFinal author submission:                                Science of the Total Environment 408 (2010) 2467\u20132473 \n 3\nof intellectual function in 142 children of 10 years of age in Bangladesh (notable difference 62 \nin intellectual function between <0.2 mg l-1 group and > 1 mg l-1 group).  Mn exposure 63 \nassociated with drinking water was also significantly positively related with hyperactive 64 \nclassroom behaviours in a study of 46 children in Qu\u00e9bec (Bouchard et al., 2007). In adults, 65 \nexposure to elevated Mn concentrations in drinking water has been associated with 66 \nmanganism, a Parkinson-like disorder.  In a study in Greece (Kondakis et al., 1989), 67 \nneurological symptoms of chronic Mn poisoning were found to increase with exposure to Mn 68 \nfrom groundwater-sourced water supplies in three populations of adults with similar social 69 \nand dietary characteristics (concentrations ranging from 0.0036 to 2.3 mg l-l, effects were first 70 \nnoted in a group drinking concentrations 0.08 to 0.25 mg l-l).  Because of the association 71 \nbetween Mn intake and neurological effects , the WHO current guideline concentration for 72 \nMn in drinking water is 0.4 mg l-1 (World Health Organization, 2008), although the USA has 73 \na lower health reference level of 0.3 mg l-1 (USEPA, 2003). In the studies by Wasserman et 74 \nal. (2006) and Kondakis et al. (1989) there was evidence of a dose-response relationship 75 \nbetween the severity of neurotoxic effects and exposure to Mn in well water suggesting that 76 \nexposure to Mn concentrations below the WHO guideline value could still result in adverse 77 \nhealth effects, with children most vulnerable (Ljung and Vahter, 2007). Consequently 78 \nBouchard et al. (2007) recommend that further research is required to establish adequate 79 \nguidelines for Mn in drinking water. 80 \n 81 \nThe occurrence and concentration of Mn in groundwater is controlled by many factors, the 82 \nmain ones being rock geochemistry, water chemistry and microbiological activity. Some rock 83 \ntypes, such as mafic and ultramafic rocks, shale, greywacke and limestone, contain high 84 \nconcentrations of Mn, which can lead to elevated concentrations in soil and sediment through 85 \nweathering processes. Water chemistry, in particular pH, redox potential (Eh), dissolved 86 \nFinal author submission:                                Science of the Total Environment 408 (2010) 2467\u20132473 \n 4\noxygen (DO), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), is instrumental in mobilising Mn and 87 \ncontrolling its speciation and concentration in the water environment. Manganese occurs 88 \nmainly as the reduced soluble Mn2+ at lower pH and Eh, but is oxidised to form precipitates 89 \nin the presence of oxygen and at higher pH (Hem, 1985). Hence in equilibrium conditions 90 \nMn is likely to occur as Mn2+ at pH<7 and at Eh as high as 800 mV. Complexation with 91 \nhumic substances (e.g. Graham et al., 2002) inhibits Mn oxidation and precipitation, although 92 \ncomplexation with inorganic ligands, such as sulphate or hydrogen carbonate, is suggested to 93 \nhave only a limited effect on Mn speciation and concentration, apart from at very high ligand 94 \nconcentrations (Hem, 1972). Micro-organisms can play an important role in Mn mobilisation 95 \nin the environment and can both enhance or inhibit concentrations in groundwater.  The 96 \neffects can be direct, through enzymatic catalysis of Mn oxidation and reduction and specific 97 \nbinding by cell-associated materials, or indirect, by altering the pH and Eh conditions of the 98 \nmicro-environment, thereby influencing Mn speciation and concentration (Nealson, 1983). 99 \nThe impact of microbiological activity on Mn behaviour in water is frequently evident in the 100 \naccumulation of oxidised Mn in biofilms on surfaces such as pipes (Sly et al., 1990). The 101 \nfactors described above frequently interact to determine Mn concentrations in groundwater. 102 \nFor example, Bourg and Bertin (1994) and Gounot (1994) attributed spatial and temporal 103 \nchanges in Mn concentrations in two alluvial aquifers in France to different mineralogical 104 \nforms of Mn and also to the reduction of solid Mn oxides to the dissolved form in anaerobic 105 \nconditions generated by microbial degradation of organic matter. 106 \n 107 \nThere is increasing evidence (Robins, 2002; MacDonald and \u00d3 Dochartaigh, 2005) that Mn is 108 \noften present in Scottish groundwaters at concentrations in excess of the Scottish drinking 109 \nwater supply limit of 0.05 mg l-1(as defined by the Water Supply (Water Quality)(Scotland) 110 \nAct 2001) and may be in excess of the WHO guideline value of 0.4 mg l-1. In Scotland 111 \nFinal author submission:                                Science of the Total Environment 408 (2010) 2467\u20132473 \n 5\ngroundwater is the main source of water for an estimated 30,000 private water supplies and 112 \napproximately 7% of public water supplies and is also a major contributor to environmental 113 \nflows, through baseflow to rivers and streams (MacDonald et al., 2005). Concerns related to 114 \nexcessive Mn concentrations are greatest for private water supplies, which are generally 115 \ngroundwater based, but are not subject to such stringent testing as public water supplies so 116 \nthat elevated concentrations could go unnoticed.  117 \nThe aims of this current research are to assess the concentrations of Mn in Scottish 118 \ngroundwaters, compare between different aquifer types, and examine controls on elevated 119 \nconcentrations in groundwater.  120 \n 121 \n2 Methods 122 \n 123 \nThe first step in the research was to compile a quality-controlled dataset of Mn concentrations 124 \nand other physicochemical parameters in Scottish groundwaters. Since 2005 considerably 125 \nmore data on Scottish groundwater have become available through the Baseline Scotland 126 \nproject, jointly funded by the British Geological Survey (BGS) and Scottish Environment 127 \nProtection Agency (SEPA), which is systematically sampling and analysing groundwater 128 \nfrom the main hydrogeological units across Scotland (BGS, 2010). Groundwater chemistry 129 \ndata from the Baseline database assembled prior to 2008 for 190 sites in eastern and southern 130 \nScotland were used. Collected samples were passed through a 0.45 \u03bcm filter and acidified to 131 \n1% v\/v with Aristar grade concentrated nitric acid in the field. Samples were analysed by 132 \nICP-MS at BGS laboratories in the UK and a commercial laboratory in Canada. 133 \n 134 \nGroundwater chemistry data for Scotland collected prior to 2005 in other BGS projects and 135 \nby other organizations were compiled and reviewed by MacDonald and \u00d3 Dochartaigh 136 \nFinal author submission:                                Science of the Total Environment 408 (2010) 2467\u20132473 \n 6\n(2005). These datasets had been subject to quality assurance, such as removing samples from 137 \nhighly contaminated sites and samples in which the balance between cations and anions 138 \ndiffered by >10%,  and were included in the Mn dataset after further quality control. The 139 \ncriteria for including samples in the Mn dataset were a limit of detection <0.003 mg Mn l-1 140 \nand use of the same sample preparation procedure as the Baseline samples (i.e. filtration and 141 \nacidification in the field). The final step in compiling the dataset was to select one set of 142 \nchemistry data for the c.100 sites which had duplicate samples in order to minimise data bias 143 \nto a particular location or geology type. Where a site had been sampled by more than one 144 \norganization, following the practice in other studies (Shand et al., 2007) data with better 145 \ndetection limits and a more comprehensive suite of analysis were preferred. Mn 146 \nconcentrations reported as less than a detection limit (only data below 0.003 mg l-1) were 147 \ngiven a numerical value of half the detection limit for statistical analysis.  148 \nThe final dataset contained data for Mn in groundwater from 475 sites across Scotland 149 \n(Figure 1).  Data were divided into nine geological categories, based on the principal 150 \ngeological units from which samples were taken (Figure 2). Categories were chosen to enable 151 \ncomparison with previous work on characterising Scottish aquifers (MacDonald and \u00d3 152 \nDochartaigh, 2005) and to contain sufficient numbers of samples for analysis to determine the 153 \neffect of geology on Mn concentrations. Relationships between Mn and a number of other 154 \nphysicochemical parameters measured in the same samples (where available) which are 155 \nlikely to influence Mn concentrations (Eh, pH, DO, DOC, specific electrical conductance 156 \n(SEC), HCO3, NO3-N, Fe, Ca, Mg) were examined using scatter plots and multiple linear 157 \nregression to assess the effect of water chemistry on Mn concentrations. Mn and Fe 158 \nconcentrations were log10-transformed for the regression analyses, conducted in Minitab v.15, 159 \nin order to normalise the data distributions. P values were used to test significance at 95% 160 \nprobability. 161 \nFinal author submission:                                Science of the Total Environment 408 (2010) 2467\u20132473 \n 7\n 162 \n3 Results 163 \n 164 \n3.1 Analysis of the complete dataset of Mn concentrations in Scottish groundwaters 165 \nMn concentrations in Scottish groundwaters are log-normally distributed, with the lower end 166 \nof the distribution affected by samples with concentrations below the limits of detection 167 \n(Figure 3). The median Mn concentration was 0.013 mg l-1, but there was a wide variation in 168 \nMn concentrations and 25th and 75th percentiles were 0.0014 mg l-1 and 0.072 mg l-1, 169 \nrespectively. The Scottish limit for Mn in drinking water of 0.05 mg l-1 was exceeded in 30% 170 \nof samples; the WHO health guideline (WHO, 2008) of 0.4 mg l-1 was exceeded in 9%, and 171 \nthe USEPA limit (USEPA, 2003) of 0.3 mg l-1 exceeded in 12%.   172 \n 173 \nSimilar distributions of Mn concentrations in groundwater used for drinking water have been 174 \nreported elsewhere. In Sweden, the median Mn concentration in 12,000 sampled wells was 175 \n0.06 mg l-1 and around 20% of wells exceeded the Swedish recommended guideline value for 176 \nprivate wells of 0.3 mg l-1 (Ljung and Vahter, 2007). In a survey of 2160 private wells in the 177 \nUSA used for household drinking water (DeSimone, 2008), 5% of those tested had Mn 178 \nconcentrations greater than the health reference level (0.4 mg l-1) and 21% had concentrations 179 \nin excess of the USEPA Secondary Maximum Contaminant Level set for aesthetic quality 180 \nand other non-health reasons (0.05 mg l-1). In a survey of total Mn (i.e. not filtered) from 181 \n10,000 groundwater sources in New Zealand, Daughney (2003) found that 39% exceeded 182 \n0.05 mg l-1 and 15% exceeded the New Zealand health guideline of 0.5mg l-1. 183 \n 184 \nFigure 1 shows the spatial distribution of groundwater Mn concentrations and Figure 2 the 185 \nbedrock aquifer units in Scotland. Mn concentrations in groundwater varied widely across 186 \nFinal author submission:                                Science of the Total Environment 408 (2010) 2467\u20132473 \n 8\nScotland and also locally. Many groundwater samples from Moray, Aberdeenshire, the 187 \nCentral Belt and Dumfries and Galloway contained excessive Mn concentrations. In contrast, 188 \ngenerally low Mn concentrations occurred in groundwater samples from the Strathmore area 189 \nand much of southern Scotland. Mn concentrations also varied within and between rock types 190 \nfrom which groundwater samples were taken (Figure 4). The Scottish drinking water limit 191 \nwas exceeded by some groundwater samples from all geological categories and lay within the 192 \ninterquartile range (25th-75th percentiles, the lower and upper limits of the boxes in Figure 4) 193 \nin the Superficial, Permian\/Triassic\/Jurassic and most notably in the Carboniferous and 194 \nNorthern Devonian categories. Mn concentrations in groundwater samples varied by at least 195 \nthree orders of magnitude within each geological category emphasising that it is not possible 196 \nto predict from rock type alone whether groundwater might have elevated Mn.  197 \nMultiple linear regression of 10 other physicochemical parameters with Mn concentration for 198 \nthe 119 samples for which all these data were available showed that Mn was significantly 199 \ninversely related to pH, Eh and DO and significantly positively related to Fe (Table 1). 200 \nTogether these parameters explained 50% of the variance in Mn concentrations. When 201 \nlog10Fe was not included, 42% of the variance was explained and the strength of the 202 \nrelationship with pH and Eh increased. Since Mn and Fe are often closely related in natural 203 \nwaters (Collins and Buol, 1970; Hem, 1985; DeSimone, 2008), the controls on Fe 204 \nconcentrations in Scottish groundwaters were investigated by repeating the multiple 205 \nregressions with Fe as the dependent variable (Table 1). Although log10Mn concentrations 206 \nwere significantly related to log10Fe, when this predictor was excluded, the parameters 207 \nsignificantly related to Fe were Eh (negatively), DOC and SEC (positively), suggesting that 208 \nMn and Fe concentrations in groundwater are affected by rather different physicochemical 209 \nconditions.   210 \n 211 \nFinal author submission:                                Science of the Total Environment 408 (2010) 2467\u20132473 \n 9\n3.2 Analysis of data for the Devonian sedimentary aquifer 212 \nMultiple regression analyses of the complete dataset helped to identify overall 213 \nphysicochemical influences on Mn and Fe concentrations in groundwater across a range of 214 \nrock types, but the patterns observed may also be affected by variation in rock geochemistry, 215 \nwhich may account for some of the unexplained variance. However, whole rock 216 \ngeochemistry data are not widely available for groundwater sampling sites in Scotland, so 217 \nfurther analysis including rock geochemistry is not currently possible. Therefore, in order to 218 \nassess in more detail the physicochemical controls on Mn concentrations in groundwater, 219 \ndata for one aquifer type (Devonian sedimentary rocks) were further interpreted, to minimise 220 \nlarge variations in manganese rock geochemistry (BGS, 2009).  Devonian aquifers are 221 \nwidespread in Scotland and provide a valuable groundwater resource (Graham et al., 2009). 222 \nSamples were available for Devonian aquifers in three geographical locations: Northern 223 \nDevonian (north of Aberdeen), Strathmore Devonian (between Aberdeen and the Firth of 224 \nTay) and Southern Devonian (south of the Firth of Tay). 225 \n 226 \nFor the Devonian dataset, multiple linear regression analyses to predict Mn and Fe 227 \nconcentrations with different numbers of predictors (Table 2) showed broadly similar 228 \nrelationships as for the total dataset.  The same physicochemical parameters (pH, Eh and DO) 229 \nwere significantly related to Mn concentrations but for the Devonian samples there was no 230 \nobservable independent relationship with Fe.  These three parameters alone explained 58% of 231 \nthe variance (compared with only 42% of the variance for the total dataset explained by pH, 232 \nEh, DO and an additional 6 parameters (Table 1)).  Eh was the strongest independent 233 \npredictor (see Table 2 and Figure 5) followed by pH and DO. Iron concentrations in the 234 \nDevonian groundwater samples were again significantly related to Eh and DOC as in the 235 \ncomplete dataset but there was no significant relationship of Fe with Mn or SEC (Table 2).  236 \nFinal author submission:                                Science of the Total Environment 408 (2010) 2467\u20132473 \n 10\n 237 \n4 Discussion 238 \n 239 \nThe analysis of groundwater chemistry data has shown that undesirable Mn concentrations 240 \nare a problem in Scotland\u2019s groundwater, with the Scottish drinking water limit being 241 \nexceeded at 30% of the 475 sites sampled, and the WHO health guideline limit being 242 \nexceeded at 9% of the sites. Mn concentrations were significantly negatively correlated to the 243 \nredox and pH conditions of the water. Excessive Mn concentrations occurred particularly in 244 \ngroundwater from the Northern Devonian, Carboniferous and Superficial geological 245 \ncategories, although high concentrations were measured in samples from all geological 246 \ncategories.  247 \n 248 \n4.1 Geology as a control on Mn concentrations 249 \nThe variation in groundwater Mn concentrations between and within different geological 250 \ncategories may be caused both by differences in the concentration and nature of Mn present 251 \nin the aquifer rocks and also the physicochemical conditions within the aquifer.  There are 252 \ninsufficient rock chemistry data to be able to test this hypothesis robustly; however, the broad 253 \ndata distribution suggests that the water chemistry conditions are more significant than Mn 254 \nmineralogy.  There is considerably more variability in Mn concentrations within aquifer types 255 \nthan between them (Figure 4) and this variability is largely explained by redox and pH 256 \nconditions.   257 \n 258 \n4.2 pH and redox conditions as controls on Mn concentrations 259 \nThe significant influence of pH and redox conditions on Mn concentrations in Scottish 260 \ngroundwaters was further investigated by plotting the Mn concentrations measured in 261 \nFinal author submission:                                Science of the Total Environment 408 (2010) 2467\u20132473 \n 11\nScottish groundwaters on a predominance diagram (Figure 6).  This diagram illustrates that 262 \nMn2+ can be mobilised over a large range of Eh and pH values. All of the Scottish data above 263 \ndetection limit plot within the Mn2+ area of the predominance diagram as would be expected.  264 \nHowever, some samples have low Mn concentrations even in conditions where Mn2+ can be 265 \nmobilised, indicating that redox and pH conditions do not totally explain manganese 266 \ndistributions in groundwater. 267 \nThe predominance diagrams for Mn suggest a stronger influence of pH on Mn mobilisation 268 \nthan Eh, since there is a greater gradient of Mn2+ concentration change in relation to pH than 269 \nEh.  However, this pattern is not apparent in either the total dataset or the Devonian subset, 270 \nwhere Eh was a much stronger predictor of Mn2+ concentrations than pH (Table 1 and 271 \nFigure 5).  This discrepancy may exist because at the near neutral pH of most Scottish 272 \ngroundwater, Mn2+ concentrations may be influenced by other factors such as complexation 273 \nwith bicarbonate and sulphate ions if they are present at high concentration (Hem, 1972) or 274 \ninteraction with Fe (Collins and Buol, 1970). 275 \n 276 \n4.3 Fe as a control on Mn concentrations  277 \nMultiple linear regression analysis of the complete dataset showed that the water chemistry 278 \nparameter most strongly related (along with dissolved oxygen) to Mn concentrations in 279 \nScottish groundwaters was Fe. However, the relationship between Mn and Fe concentrations 280 \nis not linear (Figure 7). The scatterplot of concentrations of the two elements showed that 281 \nhigh Fe concentrations only occur with high Mn concentrations, but high Mn concentrations 282 \noccur across the range of Fe concentrations. The regression analyses for predicting Mn and 283 \nFe separately using the complete dataset provided further evidence that the two elements do 284 \nnot behave in exactly the same way in Scottish groundwaters, since Mn concentrations were 285 \nsignificantly related to Eh, DO and pH, and Fe to DOC and SEC in addition to Eh. The 286 \nFinal author submission:                                Science of the Total Environment 408 (2010) 2467\u20132473 \n 12\nsignificant relationship of both Mn and Fe with Eh suggests that interaction between the two 287 \nelements in groundwater is mediated by Eh.   288 \n 289 \nThere is a close relationship between Mn and Fe oxidation and reduction in natural waters 290 \nbeyond the common redox conditions required for mobilisation (Marshall, 1979; Lind et al. 291 \n1987; Thamdrup 2000). Since Mn2+ has a high affinity for ferric oxides, the precipitation of 292 \nFe oxides at lower Eh than Mn may lead to the removal of Mn by occlusion and sorption to 293 \nprecipitated Fe ( Morgan and Stumm, 1965;Collins and Buol, 1970).  Therefore, in solutions 294 \ncontaining both Mn and Fe, such as Scottish groundwaters, which are not strongly reducing 295 \nand are circumneutral, Mn2+ concentrations may be lower than expected at a particular Eh. 296 \nConversely, when Fe oxides are reduced, Mn2+ is released. Along with the occurrence of pH 297 \nand Eh conditions which result in both Mn and Fe mobilisation, this process may also explain 298 \nwhy high Fe concentrations often occur with high Mn concentrations in Scottish 299 \ngroundwater.  An additional complication is that Fe2+ is more likely to adsorb or form 300 \ncomplexes with DOC than Mn, resulting in higher Fe2+ concentrations occurring than 301 \nexpected at a particular Eh (Hem, 1972). 302 \n 303 \n4.4 Implications for groundwater monitoring 304 \nThe research results have particular implications for monitoring of private water supplies in 305 \nScotland, which are often groundwater based. Water quality standards for private supplies in 306 \nScotland are derived from EC regulation, and monitoring and protection is carried out by 307 \nlocal authorities. The level of monitoring depends on whether a private water supply is 308 \nclassified as Type A (providing 10 m3 or more per day, supplying 50 or more people, or used 309 \nfor commercial or public activity) or Type B supplies (all others) (Astron, 2006).  Chemical 310 \nparameters are tested for in both types of supply, but Type A supplies are subject to more 311 \nFinal author submission:                                Science of the Total Environment 408 (2010) 2467\u20132473 \n 13\nregular and stringent testing and enforcement of water quality regulations than Type B, which 312 \nare only monitored on a discretionary basis (Donnelley, 2008).  Therefore, Mn may not be 313 \ntested and high concentrations can go undetected.   314 \n 315 \nAnother major issue is sampling protocol.  Samples collected for routine monitoring carried 316 \nout by the regulatory bodies are often not filtered or acidified in the field, giving unreliable 317 \nMn data.  In creating the dataset used for this Scottish study, a comparison was undertaken 318 \nbetween samples collected with good and poor protocol for 40 locations.  For samples with 319 \npoor field protocol Mn concentrations were consistently underestimated by more than an 320 \norder of magnitude.  In addition, for a reliable measure of exposure to Mn for public health 321 \nreasons, samples would need to be taken throughout the year to capture natural variations. 322 \nThe range of Mn concentrations encountered in each geological unit also has implications for 323 \ngroundwater monitoring.  Manganese concentrations in excess of the Scottish limit of 0.05 324 \nmg l-1 and the WHO health guideline value of 0.4 mg l-1 were found in each aquifer unit, and 325 \nthere was more variability within each unit than between them.  Therefore, developing hazard 326 \nmaps identifying areas of potential elevated Mn concentrations from geology alone are 327 \nunlikely to be effective. Monitoring therefore needs to be widespread. 328 \n 329 \nBased on the discussion above, more widespread testing of Scottish private water supplies 330 \nusing appropriate sampling protocols is required to give greater confidence in the Mn 331 \nconcentrations in private water supplies in Scotland.  These recommendations have relevance 332 \nelsewhere. Although studies in other countries have reported elevated Mn concentrations in 333 \ngroundwater-sourced drinking water supplies, monitoring of drinking water supplies for Mn 334 \nis not routine. 335 \n 336 \nFinal author submission:                                Science of the Total Environment 408 (2010) 2467\u20132473 \n 14\n5 Conclusion 337 \n 338 \nThis research developed a quality-controlled dataset of groundwater Mn concentrations 339 \nacross Scotland for 475 sites, which forms the basis of the analysis in this paper, and can 340 \nserve as a resource for future research into Mn occurrence in Scottish groundwaters. Analysis 341 \nof this dataset showed that elevated Mn concentrations (> 0.05 mg l-1) occurred in 30% of the 342 \nScottish groundwater sites sampled, particularly in Superficial, Carboniferous, and Northern 343 \nDevonian aquifers; and 9% of sites had concentrations above the WHO health drinking water 344 \nlimit (0.4 mg l-1). The principal controls on Mn concentrations in groundwater in Scotland are 345 \nredox conditions and pH, with some influence of Fe behaviour.  Redox conditions exercise 346 \nthe strongest control.  The scale of the problem of excessive Mn concentrations in 347 \ngroundwater across all aquifer types highlights the need for wider sampling for Mn in private 348 \nwater supplies in Scotland, and by implication, worldwide.   349 \n 350 \nAcknowledgements 351 \n 352 \nThe research was jointly funded by the British Geological Survey (BGS) and the School of 353 \nGeoSciences, The University of Edinburgh.
