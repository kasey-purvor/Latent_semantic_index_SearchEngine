Once low-order HRTF \u00delters are\ndesigned, the interpolation of these \u00delters becomes an important is-\nsue for the synthesis of moving sound sources. An HRTF \u00delter in-\nterpolation method based on the displacement of HRTF \u00delter roots\nis proposed. It is possible to obtain a minimum-phase interpolated\n\u00delter given that the original \u00delters are also minimum-phase. The\ncomputational complexity of the method is the lower than that of\nthe linear interpolation of magnitude responses.\n1. INTRODUCTION\nA head-related transfer function (HRTF) represents the spectral\nmodi\u00decation in\u00dficted upon the sound wave by the acoustical trans-\nmission path from the sound source to the ear drum [1]. HRTFs\nare used in binaural virtual auditory displays for the synthesis of\nthe direction of a sound source and the accompanying early re\u00dfec-\ntions [2].\nHRTFs can be obtained numerically with the help of geomet-\nrical models [3], or measured using human subjects or arti\u00decial\nmannequins [4, 5]. Measurements are generally made for a lim-\nited number of positions on a spherical grid of points whose centre\nis occupied by a human subject or an arti\u00decial mannequin. If full-\nlength HRTFs obtained in these measurements are used, the \u00del-\ntering task involved in auralization becomes computationally too\ndemanding. The general solution to this problem is to design and\nuse low-order \u00delters that are perceptually equivalent to using full-\nlength HRTFs.\nIf the limited number of measured HRTFs are used for aural-\nization, smooth and continuous movement of sound sources cannot\nbe achieved. Therefore, interpolation of HRTFs (or HRTF \u00delters)\nfor obtaining HRTFs (or HRTF \u00delters) at intermediate directions is\nan essential step for the synthesis of virtual sound source motion\nand providing a seamless virtual auditory reality.\nThere exists a variety of methods applied to the HRTF inter-\npolation problem. Most of the previously reported interpolation\nmethods use the magnitude responses of minimum-phase recon-\nstructed HRTFs rather than the \u00delters designed from these HRTFs.\nThese methods utilize linear [6], spline [7] or triangular [8] inter-\npolation to obtain an interpolated magnitude response between the\nmagnitude responses of two, three, or four HRTFs and then de-\nsign a new interpolated HRTF \u00delter from the obtained magnitude\nresponse.\nThis work was funded by EPSRC Research Grant GR\/S72320\/01\nMore complex HRTF interpolation approaches utilize spatial\nfrequency response surfaces [9], non-linear interpolation with neu-\nral networks [10], active sensory tuning [11], approximation on a\nsphere using spherical basis functions [12], inter-positional trans-\nfer functions [13], and oversampling of DFT coef\u00decients [14].\nWe distinguish HRTF \u00delter interpolation from HRTF interpo-\nlation. The former is an interpolation between two (or more) \u00del-\nters modelling the HRTFs while the latter requires a \u00delter to be\ndesigned after the interpolation process. The interpolation method\nproposed in this paper is carried out by displacing the \u00delter roots\nsince the frequency features which are essential cues in spatial\nhearing are represented more explicitly by the \u00delter roots.\nSection 2 summarizes the design of the HRTF \u00delters used in\nthe present work. HRTF \u00delter interpolation using the zero-dis-\nplacement measure is presented in Section 3. A brief comparison\nof linear interpolation and the proposed method is made and the\nconclusions are drawn in Section 4.\n2. HRTF FILTER DESIGN\nAn HRTF can be represented as the combination of a minimum-\nphase and an all-pass component. This property is frequently ex-\nploited in HRTF \u00delter design. The HRTF is decomposed using the\ncepstrum analysis into a minimum-phase function, whose magni-\ntude response is the same as that of the HRTF, and an all-pass\nfunction, whose phase represents the phase response of the HRTF.\nApart from a small deviation for high frequencies, the phase re-\nsponse can be approximated to be linear (i.e. constant group-de-\nlay). Therefore, the interaural time delay (ITD) can be modelled\nas a constant delay. This constant delay can be obtained by \u00dending\nthe delay corresponding to the maximum of the cross-correlation\nof the original left and right ear HRTFs. Further, as there is no\nneed to model the phase and magnitude response properties of the\nHRTF \u00delter simultaneously, it is possible to design low-order \u00del-\nters [15].\nThe HRTF \u00delters used as examples in this paper are obtained\nby minimum-phase reconstructing raw HRTFs and truncating the\nobtained minimum-phase impulse response to 65 samples by using\na Hamming window centered at t = 0. This operation provides the\ncoef\u00decients of 64th-order minimum-phase FIR \u00delters. It should be\nbe noted that the intepolation method proposed in this paper is\napplicable to all-poles IIR \u00delters equally well. The HRTFs used in\nthe design of the \u00delters were obtained from the compact dataset of\nthe MIT KEMAR HRTF database [5].\n0-7803-9154-3\/05\/$20.00 \u00a92005 IEEE 134\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

INTERPOLATION OF HTRF FILTERS BY ROOT\nDISPLACEMENT\nAssume that we have two real-valued, Kth-order (K is even) FIR\n\u00delters, H1(z) and H2(z) of the general form:\nHi(z) = HiC(z)\u00d7HiR(z), (1)\nwhere HiC , and HiR represent the complex and real \u00delter sections\nsuch that:\nHiC(z) =\nNi\nk=1\n1\u2212 ci,k z\n\u22121 1\u2212 c\u2217i,k z\n\u22121 , (2)\nHiR(z) =\nMi\nl=1\n1\u2212 ri,l z\n\u22121 . (3)\nHere, ci,k and its complex conjugate c\n\u2217\ni,k are the complex zeros,\nand ri,l are the real zeros of the \u00delter. The zeros of an FIR \u00delter\nde\u00dening its characteristics around \u03c9 = 0 and \u03c9 = pi, and 0 <\n\u03c9 < pi can thus be separated.\nAssume that H1(z) has 2N1 complex zeros and M1 = K \u2212\n2N1 real zeros, and H2(z) has 2N2 complex zeros and M2 =\nK \u2212 2N2 real zeros. These \u00delters can be represented in the z-\ndomain as the real (H1R(z), and H2R(z)) and complex (H1C(z),\nand H2C(z)) sections. The aim of interpolation is to obtain new\nHRTF \u00delter(s), Hin(z), with magnitude responses between the\ntwo original \u00delters.\nEquations 1\u00963 represent a cascade form FIR \u00delter [16]. The\ninterpolation method proposed in this paper uses the roots that rep-\nresent the cascaded second-order FIR sections for interpolation. In\nother words, corresponding \u00delter roots are determined, and inter-\nmediate \u00delter roots are derived from these. This requires the num-\nber of the complex zeros and the real zeros of the two \u00delters to be\nequal (i.e. N1 = N2 and M1 = M2). Therefore, before the inter-\npolation, the combination of real and complex zeros for each \u00delter\nis equalized by replacing or substituting real zeros when necessary.\n3.1. Equalization of the Number of Real Zeros\nThree cases are possible for a given real-valued even-order FIR\n\u00delter:\n\u2022 Case 1: The \u00delter has more than 2 real zeros (Mi > 2),\n\u2022 Case 2: The \u00delter has no real zeros (Mi = 0),\n\u2022 Case 3: The \u00delter has 2 real zeros only (Mi = 2).\nCase 3 is selected as the baseline condition and the number of real\nzeros of the original \u00delters are equalized to two such that the FIR\n\u00delters can be represented as a combination of K\u22122 complex zeros\nand 2 real zeros.\nFor the baseline condition, the real zeros of the \u00delters consti-\ntute second-order FIR sections, which have high-pass, low-pass or\nband-pass characteristics depending on the signs of the real zeros.\nThe following two methods can be used for reducing or substi-\ntuting real zeros for obtaining equal number of real zeros in both\n\u00delters:\n3.1.1. Method 1\nFor Case 1, the real zeros of the same sign are coupled and re-\nplaced with equivalent pseudo-complex zeros such that the number\nof the real zeros are decreased by two and the number of complex\nzeros are increased by two without signi\u00decantly affecting the mag-\nnitude response.\nAssume that we have a \u00delter with two excess positive real ze-\nros, (r1 = a, and r2 = b) and we want to substitute a pair of\npseudo-complex zeros (cs = p + j\u0004 and c\n\u2217\ns = p \u2212 j\u0004) such that\nthe error function,\nE(z) = (1\u2212 az\u22121)(1\u2212 bz\u22121)\u2212 (1\u2212 csz\n\u22121)(1\u2212 c\u2217sz\n\u22121), (4)\nvanishes at \u03c9 = 0 (i.e. z\u22121 = 1), where 0 < a, b < 1, a, b \u2208 R+,\nand \u0004 is suf\u00deciently small. When the error function is solved for\nz = 1, p can be found as:\np \u223c= 1\u2212 (1\u2212 a\u2212 b + ab). (5)\nThe derivation for negative real zeros is similarly done by substi-\ntuting z\u22121 = \u22121.\nIf there are more than 2 real zeros, the method explained above\nis applied a number of times to obtain \u00delters with 2 real zeros each.\nIt must be noted that only the real zeros with the same sign can be\nreplaced this way. This is the reason why the number of real zeros\ncannot be further reduced using the described method.\nThe method of substituting real zeros with equivalent pseudo-\ncomplex conjugate zeros does not violate the minimum-phase con-\nditions since |cs| = p2 + \u00042 < 1 for suf\u00deciently small \u0004, given\nthat 0 < a < 1 and 0 < b < 1.\n3.1.2. Method 2\nFor Case 2, the complex conjugate zeros that are the nearest to\nz\u22121 = \u22121 (i.e. \u03c9 = pi) are substituted with two real zeros such\nthat the number of complex zeros are decreased by two while the\nnumber of real zeros are increased by two, without signi\u00decantly af-\nfecting the magnitude response of the \u00delter for lower frequencies.\nAssume that we have a pair of complex conjugate zeros (c =\n\u2212d + jg, and c\u2217 = \u2212d \u2212 jg) and we want to substitute with a\npair of real zeros (rs1 = rs2 = \u2212m) where 0 < d, g, m < 1, and\nd, g, m \u2208 R+ such that the error, E:\nE(z) = (2d\u2212 2m)z\u22121 + (d2 + g2 \u2212m2) (6)\nis minimum. Given that g is small for zeros near \u03c9 = pi, Equation\n6 can be solved to give m = \u2212\u0004{c} = d.\nThe frequency spectrum at \u03c9 = pi is well-de\u00dened. Therefore,\neven if negative real zeros do not exist, complex conjugate zeros\nare present at the immediate vicinity.\n3.2. Interpolation of the Complex Zeros\nThe complex zeros of the original HRTF \u00delters to be used in the\ninterpolation are sorted with respect to their phases and paired ac-\ncording to their angular proximity. A zero displacement vector is\ncalculated using the paired complex zeros as:\n\u0005\u03bdk = c1,k \u2212 c2,k, k = 1, 2, . . . , L, (7)\nwhere L = (K \u2212 2)\/2. The interpolated complex zeros, cint,k,\ncan be calculated using this zero displacement vector as:\ncint,k = c1,k \u2212 \u03c1 \u0005\u03bdk = [1\u2212 \u03c1] c1,k + \u03c1 c2,k, (8)\n135\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

The magnitude of the interpolated zero is:\n|cint,k| = |(1\u2212 \u03c1) c1,k + \u03c1 c2,k|\n= (1\u2212 \u03c1)2 |c1,k|\n2 + \u03c12 |c2,k|\n2\n(9)\n+(2\u03c1\u2212 2\u03c12) |c1,k||c1,k| cos \u03be\n1\n2 ,\nwhere \u03be is the angular separation between the zeros. Therefore, it\ncan be shown for 0 \u2264 \u03c1 \u2264 1 that the interpolated zeros are inside\nthe unit circle (i.e. minimum-phase) if the original zeros are inside\nthe unit circle (i.e. |c1,k|, |c2,k| < 1).\nConsider two zeros c1,k = A1 + jB1, and c2,k = A2 +\njB2 with their complex conjugate pairs. The interpolated complex\nconjugate zero pair, {cint,k} can be calculated as:\n{cint,k} = [\u03c1A1 + (1\u2212 \u03c1)A2]\u00b1 j [\u03c1B1 + (1\u2212 \u03c1)B2] ,\n= Aint,k \u00b1 jBint,k\n(10)\nThe interpolated pair of zeros constitute a second order FIR sec-\ntion, Hint,k, such that:\nHint,k(z) = 1\u2212 2Aint,k z\n\u22121 + (A2int,k + B\n2\nint,k) z\n\u22122,\n= 1 + qk,1 z\n\u22121 + qk,2 z\n\u22122.\n(11)\nThe coef\u00decients, {qk}, of this second order block can thus be ob-\ntained easily from the real and complex parts of the interpolated\nzero (see Figure 1(a)). All of the obtained second-order FIR sec-\ntions are cascaded as shown in Figure 1(b).\n3.3. Interpolation of the Real Zeros\nAfter the interpolation of the complex parts, the remaining two real\nzeros need to be interpolated. These zeros also constitute second\norder \u00delter sections. They can be interpolated linearly using the\npolynomial form of coef\u00decients:\nHint,R(z) = [\u03c1\u00d7H1R(z)] + [(1\u2212 \u03c1)\u00d7H2R(z)] , (12)\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n\u0166150\n\u0166100\n\u016650\n0\n50\nNormalized Frequency  (uS rad\/sample)\nP\nh\na\ns\ne\n (\nd\ne\ng\nre\ne\ns\n)\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n\u016640\n\u016620\n0\n20\nNormalized Frequency  (uS rad\/sample)\nM\na\ng\nn\nit\nu\nd\ne\n (\nd\nB\n)\nFigure 2: Interpolation between HRTF \u00delters for \u03b8 = 30\u25e6, \u03c6 = 0\u25e6\nand \u03b8 = 40\u25e6, \u03c6 = 10\u25e6.\nwhere 0 < \u03c1 < 1. The \u00delter Hint,R(z) has a magnitude spectrum\nbetween the original \u00delters H1R(z) and H2R(z).\n3.4. Combination of the Complex and Real Parts\nThe interpolated \u00delter is obtained by cascading the interpolated\n\u00delter blocks for the complex and the real zeros. Therefore, the ob-\ntained \u00delter is a cascade form FIR \u00delter consisting of second order\nFIR sections that can be interpolated separately. Figure 2 shows\nthe combined effect of interpolation applied to the complex and\nreal parts of two HRTF \u00delters. The interpolation parameter \u03c1 is\nvaried from 0 to 1 with intervals of 0.1. It may be observed that\nthe proposed interpolation method is useful for interpolating be-\ntween both the magnitude and the phase responses of the original\n\u00delters. Figure 3(a) shows the interpolation of the HRTF \u00delters on\nthe horizontal plane. Figure 3(b) shows the interpolation of HRTF\n\u00delters on the median plane. The darker regions signify higher val-\nues of magnitude spectra and the vertical spread of the associated\nregion represents the signi\u00decance of the given frequency feature.\n4. DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS\nA new HRTF \u00delter interpolation method for FIR \u00delters based on\nthe displacement of the \u00delter roots was proposed in this paper. This\nmethod can be used for the interpolation of minimum-phase HRTF\n\u00delters for the seamless synthesis of the three dimensional auditory\nspace and sound source motion. The proposed method does not\nrequire explicit information of the shape of the \u00delters\u0092 frequency\nspectra. Rather, it uses the zeros of the original \u00delters in the in-\nterpolation stage. It guarantees that the interpolated FIR \u00delter is\nminimum-phase.\nIn comparison with the linear interpolation of HRTF magni-\ntude responses, the major advantage of the proposed method is its\nability to interpolate between two magnitude spectra without hav-\ning to redesign a \u00delter. The calculation of the interpolated coef-\n\u00decients of cascaded FIR sections has a computational complexity\nof O(n). The computational complexity of linear interpolation of\nmagnitude spectra is O(n log2 n), because of the FFT operations\ninvolved. This makes the proposed method suitable and favourable\nfor use in HRTF \u00delter interpolation in real-time.\n136\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.
