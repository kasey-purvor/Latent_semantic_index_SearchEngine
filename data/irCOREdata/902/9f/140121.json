We do this \nby considering current governance regulation in the light of interviews with protagonists \nin the debate, setting out the dilemmas faced by remuneration-setters, and showing how \nthe processes they follow can lead to ethical conflicts.  \n \nCurrent \u2018best\u2019 practice governing executive pay includes the use of market benchmarks to \ndetermine salary and bonus levels, significant levels of performance-related pay, the \ndesire for executives to hold equity in their companies, the disclosure of total shareholder \nreturn compared to an index, and a perceived need for conformity, in order to grant \nlegitimacy to policies.  Whilst each of these may in some circumstances lead to good \npractice, each has the potential to cause dysfunctional behaviour in executives. \n \nOverall, we conclude that although best practice might drive good executive behaviour, \nthat coincides with the company\u2019s and key stakeholders\u2019 objectives, there are many \nreasons why it should not.  \nKeywords:  compensation, ethics, executive, governance, remuneration, stakeholder \n 2\nDOES \u2018BEST PRACTICE\u2019 IN SETTING EXECUTIVE PAY \nIN THE UK ENCOURAGE \u2018GOOD\u2019 BEHAVIOUR? \nFor more than a decade, executive compensation in the United Kingdom (UK), United \nStates (US) and other jurisdictions has attracted unfavourable attention from practitioners, \nacademics and the media, who have focused on the large amounts received by executives, \nboth in absolute terms and in comparison with pay received by employees lower down \nthe corporate hierarchy.  Much of this commentary is about whether the level of pay is \n\u2018fair\u2019, either to employees or to shareholders, who see high executive rewards even when \nshare price performance is poor.   \n \nPartly as a result of this attention, the area has been subject to continued regulation, with \ngovernment directives and voluntary codes focusing on the nature of pay and its \ndisclosure.  In recent years, regulation in the UK has attempted to address these concerns \nby demanding that companies increase the proportion of pay that is performance-related \nrather than fixed salary, and by increasing the level of disclosure of executive reward.  \nThis regulation commenced with the Greenbury Report (1995) and is seen most recently \nin the Combined Code (2003).  However, despite these layers of regulation, we do not \nknow whether the way in which executive pay is set addresses issues of \u2018fairness\u2019 nor, \nmore broadly, how this might impact the behaviour of executive directorsi. \n \nThis paper asks whether the pay practices, in particular the way that pay is determined, \nthat are regarded as comprising good governance encourage good behaviour.  In order to \naddress this question, a view must be taken as to what behaviour is in fact required;  in \n 3\nother words, what \u2018good\u2019 looks like.  We start from the point of view that good behaviour \nmeans that the remuneration scheme will encourage executives to act in ways that are \nmost appropriate for the company\u2019s circumstances.  To some extent, the determination of \nthis depends upon the perspective taken of the firm, be it a shareholder perspective \n(Friedman, 1962) or a stakeholder one (e.g.  Evan and Freeman,  1992):  different \nstakeholders have different needs of the organisation.  Our way to resolve this is to refer \nto the OECD\u2019s preamble to its Principles of Corporate Governance: \nCorporate governance involves a set of relationships between a company\u2019s management, \nits board, its shareholders and other stakeholders.  \u2026  Good corporate governance should \nprovide proper incentives for the board and management to pursue objectives that are in \nthe interests of the company and its shareholders and should facilitate effective monitoring.  \n(OECD, 2004:  11) \n \nIt can be seen that although other stakeholders are considered, the OECD definition \nclearly privileges the shareholder.  Thus, as Wilhelm (1993:  469) states, the best \nremuneration schemes should reward executives for making decisions in the best interests \nof shareholders.  Accordingly, in this paper we focus largely on the shareholder, and see \n\u2018good\u2019 in that light.  However, given the forthcoming changes to UK company law \n(Company Law Reform Bill, 2005, 10 (2) (156)) relating to \u2018enlightened shareholder \nvalue\u2019, which states that directors should also have regard to the interests of other \nstakeholders, we do also make reference to how these governance practices can affect \nother stakeholders. \n \n 4\nThe literature on executive pay (reviewed, for example, by Merchant et al., 2003;  \nWerner and Ward, 2004)  mostly focuses on pay as an agency issue, in which \nremuneration contracts are designed to align executives\u2019 and shareholders\u2019 interests, \nalthough some social-psychological issues such as social comparison are researched \n(O'Reilly et al., 1988).  However, these are to some extent static analyses:  they use \narchival data to examine the outcomes of the remuneration-setting process, but not the \nprocesses themselves.  Indeed, the extant literature contains few papers (for example:  \nMcNulty and Pettigrew, 1999;  Pye, 2001;  Roberts, McNulty, and Stiles, 2005;  Perkins \nand Hendry, 2005) that examine the processes undertaken by boards of directors.  \nAccordingly, our motivation in writing this paper is to look at the processes behind the \npay policies and packages, to understand the objectives of the protagonists in setting \nremuneration, and to highlight the factors that influence their decisions, and the outcomes \nthat result. \n \nTo address this issue, and to present an analysis of the impact of the current governance \nregime and the resulting behaviours it can drive, this paper draws upon the results of \ninterview-based research with protagonists in the remuneration-setting decision in a \nselection of FTSE 350 companies based in the UK.  The aim of the interviews was to \ndetermine how pay levels and structures were determined, and the issues considered by \nthe remuneration-setters.  The interviews covered the decisions made, and how these \ndecisions were addressed, given the constraints of best practice and corporate governance \nregulation.  The results indicate that some of the practices commonly regarded as good \ngovernance may have an unfortunate side-effect of encouraging behaviour that is not \n 5\nnecessarily in the interests of the company or its stakeholders.  Thus we provide empirical \nevidence to address some of the questions raised, in a US context, by Matsumura and \nShin (2005). \n \nThere are many papers, by both academics and practitioners, that suggest how \nremuneration practices might be changed (for example, Lee, 2002;  Bebchuk and Fried, \n2004).  That is not the aim of this paper, and we do not venture into that territory.  Our \ncontribution is to set out what is happening, given that little previous research has \nuncovered how pay is set and the behaviours it drives.  We address practice as is, and \nleave it to others to build upon these findings to recommend changes.   \n \nThe rest of this paper is organised as follows.  The next section briefly sets the context of \nrecent developments in governance in the UK relating to executive directors\u2019 pay.  We \nthen describe the research approach, and the following sections describe how companies \ndetermine pay and how this is affected by considerations of best practice.  The final \nsection concludes, discussing the relationship between best practice and good behaviour. \n \nCorporate Governance Requirements Regarding Executive Pay \nThe field of governance in the UK has evolved considerably since the Cadbury Report in \n1992.  Many regulations have impacted on remuneration practices.  Current governance \nregulations specifically relating to executive remuneration include the Combined Code  \n(2003) (\u201cthe Code\u201d) and the Directors\u2019 Remuneration Report Regulations (Department of \n 6\nTrade and Industry (\u201cDTI\u201d), 2002) (\u201cthe Report Regulations\u201d).  As regards the Code, one \nsection is particularly relevant to this paper: \nLevels of remuneration should be sufficient to attract, retain and motivate directors of the \nquality required to run the company successfully, but a company should avoid paying more \nthan is necessary for this purpose.  A significant proportion of executive directors\u2019 \nremuneration should be structured so as to link rewards to corporate and individual \nperformance.  (2003, B1) \n \nWe note later in this paper the difficulties that companies have in determining pay that is \nsufficient to attract and retain directors, but not excessive. \n \nThe Report Regulations extended the already considerable disclosure required by UK \nlisted companies.  Key disclosures for the published remuneration report include:  \n1. a statement of remuneration policy;  \n2. details of remuneration committee membership and meetings;  \n3. advisors to the remuneration committee;  \n4. details of individual directors' service contracts;  \n5. a five year performance graph;  \n6. details and explanation of performance measures for long-term incentives; and \n7. details of individual directors' remuneration.  \nOf these disclosures, items 5, 6 and 7 in particular are pertinent and are discussed in this \npaper. \n \n 7\nResearch approach \nThe study reported in this paper examined how executive directors\u2019 pay was determined \nin selected companies.  It adopted a multiple company case study approach as suggested \nby Yin (1994), with the unit of analysis being the company.  It is an exploratory study;  \nan appropriate approach given the fact, as stated earlier, that there is little in the extant \nbody of literature that discusses board and committee processes. \n \nThe research method was to conduct face-to-face interviews (lasting on average an hour) \nwith protagonists in the remuneration-setting decision.  40 interviews were conducted in \nall.  35 of these were at 12 FTSE 350 companies;  the five other interviews, to gain wider \nviews of the process, and to confirm initial findings, included headhunters, an \ninstitutional representative and two focus groupsii.  The fieldwork was mainly carried out \nin 2002 and 2003.  Table 1 sets out the roles of the corporate participants and the number \nof respondents from each firmiii. \n \nTABLE 1 ABOUT HERE \n \nThe case companies were selected in a variety of ways.  The first six were cold-called, \nthe selection being made based on data obtained from the PricewaterhouseCoopers \nCorporate Register (a commercial database of companies and directors) dated June 2001.  \nCompanies 7 to 10 joined the study through contact, via one of the early interviewees, \nwith a group of executive remuneration professionals in FTSE 100 companies.  \nInterviews at companies 11 and 12 arose after one of the authors had presented some \n 8\nearly findings at a corporate governance conference (Bender, 2003).  The main criteria \nfor selecting companies for the research were (a) that they appeared to follow the \ngovernance regulations laid down in the Code;  and (b) that their non-executive directors \n(NEDs) between them had experience of several different companies.  A further criterion \nwas the desire to include some utilities in the sample, as utilities provide an interesting \ncontext to explore executive pay in the UK, for historical and commercial reasons.iv\n \nThe interviews were semi-structured, but wide-ranging.  An interview protocol was \ndrawn up based on an extensive literature review, with the broad aim of establishing the \nprocesses by which the directors\u2019 remuneration policies and packages were determined in \nthe selected companies.  The focus was on the individual companies and what was done \nthere, rather than asking interviewees to comment on best practice, although inevitably \nbest practice was discussed.  The interview protocol was piloted at two companies \n(included in the 12), and was not changed for the larger study. \n \nIn addition to the interviews, documentation such as remuneration committee meeting \nminutes and consultants\u2019 reports was obtained from five of the companies (the others \nwould not make such information available).  Furthermore, financial statements \n(including the published remuneration reports) were obtained for all companies for the \nprevious, current and subsequent years.  These various forms of documentation were used \nbefore the meetings to set a context for individual discussion, and after the meetings to \nconfirm, where possible, details of schemes and processes that had been discussed.  \nFurther detail on the research method is given in Bender (2004). \n 9\n Before setting out the results of the research, it is useful to put the study in context.  The \nparticipating companies were to some extent self-selecting.  About 50 companies were \napproached for the study; only 12 agreed to become involvedv.  It is reasonable to assume \n\u2013 both a priori and from later discussions with the interviewees \u2013 that the case companies \nbecame involved because they were interested in governance issues and believed that \ntheir own practices would stand up to research scrutiny.  Given the research approach, \nand the fact that there is no intention to generalise to an overall population from this \nwork, that does not present a problem.  It is, however, important,  as the sample \npopulation can therefore be assumed to include only \u2018good\u2019 companies, and individuals \nwho were trying to follow what they perceived as good practice.  For a discussion on the \nethics of executive pay, this is a useful starting point.  \n \nStakeholders in the pay-setting decision \nUK listed companies have formally-constituted remuneration committees of NEDs to \ndetermine executive pay.  In all of the case companies, the committee membership \ngenerally drew on the advice and expertise of the HR support staff and the company \nsecretary. However, the CEO and chairman were often in attendance at the committee \nmeetings, and provided input into their agendas.  The contribution of these participants \nwas considered important, as the view of the executives who lead the business is \ngenerally seen as critical in designing schemes to meet corporate strategy.  (This is \nconsidered good practice under the Code (2003,  B2).) \n \n 10\nIn determining executive pay, remuneration committees have to have regard to several \ndifferent constituencies:  the board (representing the company), executives, shareholders \nand possibly others.  Although shareholders, particularly institutional shareholders, were \nconsidered pivotal in most of the companies, the level and structure of remuneration were \nset with a view to satisfying three specific stakeholders.  As one of the interviewees \nstated: \nWhat you\u2019re trying to do here is to identify a solution that is right for three parties:  the \ninvestors, the company, and the managers.  And all the time, they are concerned with those \nthree dimensions.  And if it isn't satisfactory to any one of those three, it's not satisfactory.  \nThere's no point in coming up with something which the company thinks is wonderful, the \ninvestors think is wonderful, which has no value to the directors. \nHR professional \n \nIt was clear that these three stakeholders were considered in remuneration-setting in all \nthe case companies, although in some more weight was given to the executives, and in \nsome the shareholders were seen as key.  Under the Combined Code (2003, B2.4) \nshareholders should be invited specifically to approve all new long-term incentive \nschemes and significant changes to existing schemes.  Accordingly, there was formal and \ninformal consultation with major shareholders and their representative bodies (the \nAssociation of British Insurers and the National Association of Pension Funds). \n \nEmployees and customers are also stakeholders, and although they were not specifically \nconsulted about executive pay, their likely views were sometimes considered.  For \nexample, the remuneration practices and disclosures of utilities are governed by the UK\u2019s \n 11\nvarious utilities acts, which meant that all of the utilities in the in the sample had \ncustomer- and employee-related performance measures attached to their bonus awards. \nFurthermore, some interviewees referred to the way in which executive pay would be \nperceived by these stakeholders.   \nYou have in a remuneration structure to try and ensure that you've got fairness.  That\u2019s \nfairness to the individual and fairness to the organisation.  And the organisation means all \nthe constituent parts:  the customers, the other members of staff, and the shareholders. \nCEO (non-utility) \nThus remuneration policies did appear in these case companies to take account of \nstakeholder interests, although this was not a universal approach. \n \nHow best practice affects executive pay \nThe interviewees discussed various ways in which \u2018best practice\u2019 affected pay levels and \nstructures.  These included using market benchmarks to set pay and bonus levels;  the \nneed to be fair, and to be seen to be fair to the various parties;  the ubiquitous use of \nperformance-related pay;  the choice of performance measures and targets, including the \nuse of total shareholder return (TSR) as a performance measure and the perceived need \nfor conformance in determining pay policies;  and the requirement for executives to hold \nequity in their companies.  Each of these is discussed in turn.  \n \n 12\nThe use of market benchmarks \nAlthough executive pay is perceived to be high as compared to that of the general \npopulation, it is impossible to state whether, generally, it is \u2018too high\u2019.  No clear, \nworkable guidelines have ever been established to determine what levels of pay would be \nappropriate, even though several researchers have considered this subject.  For example, \nCox and Power (1991) and Perel (2003) both report the attitudes of various stakeholders \nin the executive pay debate, but come to no conclusion.  Nichols and Subramaniam \n(2001) discuss the argument that executives are overpaid, and that the amount of such \noverpayment is increasing, and then compare that with the argument made by others, that \nexecutives are paid a fair amount.  They conclude that both viewpoints are unsatisfactory;  \nover- or under-payment can only be judged in relation to others, and there is no clear \nstandard for comparison.  Interestingly, Moriarty (2005) does set out a case for executives \nbeing overpaid, using a range of different comparators.  However, he fails to establish a \nbasis to determine the \u2018correct\u2019 level of pay. \n \nIn practice, pay is generally set with reference to sector-based remuneration surveys that \nmeasure companies on size, which sets a benchmark that can be justified to investors. \n \nSeveral issues arise from this use of market surveys to set pay.  In addition to the aspects \nof fairness, discussed next in this paper, are matters of the ratcheting up of pay, and the \nneed to retain good executives.  These are all linked, as remuneration committees and \ntheir advisors appreciate the problems of ever-increasing pay levels, but worry about \nlosing valuable employees.   \n 13\nWhen we look at salaries we look at base pay, and we're very careful to construct \nsomething that looks exactly competitive with our competitors.  \u2026  once we do incentives \nwe also do look at what the market is paying for equivalent jobs.  \u2026  But we are saying to \nourselves 'does this look right?'.  Because as I said before, our executives, male and \nfemale, always have the opportunity of taking something else, given their skills.  And \ncertainly, comparability of the package is an important factor in that. \nCommittee chairman \n \nThis extract highlights one of the main worries of remuneration committees \u2013 that they \nmay lose good people by paying below the market.  However, some authors believe the \nargument on retention to be overdone, in that executives paid less than the market are \nunlikely to leave.  For example, Wilhelm (1993:  480) comments that:  \n\u2026 surveys are bogus and CEO mobility is really low.  Surveys presume that underpaid \nCEOs have many better-paying CEO jobs available to them.  Openings are in fact scarce \nand many CEOs wouldn\u2019t be hired because their skills are limited mainly to one company \nor industry\u2026 \n \nThe ratcheting up of executive pay (Hamilton, 1995;  Moules, 2004) has to a large extent \nbeen driven by that most important of governance principles \u2013 disclosure.  Following the \nGreenbury report (1995), which required companies to disclose the pay details for each \ndirector separately, individuals and companies had a clear benchmark.  Several \ninterviewees expressed sentiments similar to the following. \nIn my view, by far the biggest input on the steady increase in executive director pay over \nthe last decade has been the Greenbury report.  Publication of directors' remuneration has \n 14\nhad an inevitable upward push on executive pay.  It would be interesting to know how many \nof your remuneration committees were prepared to say that they would aim their target \nremuneration in the bottom quartile. \nHeadhunter \nSuch an increase in pay resulting from disclosure is in line with the observations of \nMatsumura and Shin (2005), who commented, in a US context, that although additional \ndisclosures could mean improved governance, they could also lead to a \u201cbeauty contest\u201d \nin which levels of compensation increased as firms desired their executives to be amongst \nthe highest paid. \n \nThe level of total pay also reflects the amount of bonus earned and the long-term award, \nand these too have been increasing in recent years, following the market up in the same \nway as has salary.  The following comment is representative. \nThe reason we went from 40% to 60% [bonus cap] was because we were advised by \n[consultancy] that that was what the typical market company was doing.  And therefore we \njust thought that we were falling in line with market practice.  And I think that was true. \nCommittee chairman \n \nThis increase in variable pay levels has a multiplier effect on the overall package.   \n \nMany of the interviewees did comment that compensation was \u2018too high\u2019, although none \ncould suggest a mechanism to reduce the acceleration of executive pay, and none was \nwilling to be the first company to put the brakes on.  There was, however, one exception \n 15\nto this.  In one company, in one year, the CEO prevented the remuneration committee \nfrom implementing a survey-based pay rise that he thought (based partly on a conscious \nregard to the ongoing political debate about executive pay) was too high.  Instead, he took \nsoundings from colleagues at other companies, and concluded that a general inflation \nincrease would be more appropriate than the sums suggested by the surveys. \n \nOverall, the participants were well aware of the problems caused by continually \nincreasing levels of executive pay, and understood that the market comparisons and full \ndisclosure were at least in part a cause of this.  However, they were unable or unwilling to \ntake action to limit the rise in executive salaries and bonuses, for fear of losing valuable \nemployees.  Using the language of the Code (2003, B1), pay levels were set to attract and \nretain directors, but it was difficult to establish what level would be \u201cmore than is \nnecessary\u201d. \n \nThe need for fairness \nRelated to the above is the need for fairness in setting remuneration at senior levels.  \nExecutive pay has to be fair both to the executives and also to the shareholders to whom \nbelong the company\u2019s residual profits:  excessive remuneration reduces these profits.  As \nan example of the latter, in one company the executive bonus was reduced by the \nremuneration committee, despite the targets being met, because a poor acquisition had led \nto an erosion of shareholder value, and the committee took the view that it was \nappropriate that the executives share the shareholders\u2019 loss.vi  However, overall, fairness \nto the executives featured more in our interviews than fairness to shareholders. \n 16\n As Bloom (2004) points out with regard to employees in general, fairness may be critical \nto a well-designed compensation scheme.  Bloom suggests several criteria for fairness, \nincluding fair pay for fair work (with better performers receiving more), and procedural \nfairness in allocating pay between employees.  He notes that compensation systems \u201cmay \nalso be important signals of the values, morals, and virtues upon which the organization \noperates\u201d (2004:  150).  The interviewees in this study reflected Bloom\u2019s view of the \nmany aspects of fairness, referring separately to three ways in which the executive \ncompensation needed to be fair, as set out below. \n \n(a) Fairness between different executives in the same company \nOne aspect of fairness related to principles of distributive and procedural justice (Adams, \n1963;  Bloom, 2004).  The pay differential between members of the executive \nmanagement team has to be perceived as fair, and performance-related pay has to go to \nthose who perform well, in order to differentiate the contributions of managers.   \nOne, we actually wanted to ensure that we did introduce this element of variable pay to \nincentivise people, and therefore we wanted to ensure that we paid everybody a fair rate for \nthe job, but that those who achieved most had the ability to increase their reward. \nHR professional \nThis sentiment, that fair pay would reflect the differing contributions of individuals, was \nexpressed by several of the interviewees. \n \n(b) Fairness between executives and their peers in comparable companies   \n 17\nEquity theory (Adams, 1963) suggests that the managers compare their roles and \ncontributions, and their pay, with those of their peers, and will be satisfied if the ratios of \nwork inputs to pay outcomes are about the same.  Remuneration-setters were very \nconscious of this need for comparability, both in levels of pay (as evidenced by the \nuniversal use of remuneration surveys) and in the ability to generate large bonuses \nthrough performance-related elements. \nWhat [he] wants and expects is to be paid fairly.  He would regard being paid fairly in two \nways.  One, that the basic amount he gets is reasonably comparable with those that he \nregards as his peers outside.  And the second thing he'd expect is that if he and the \ncompany perform better, he gets paid more.  Now that is what he would regard as being \ntreated fairly.  So if he didn't get that he would regard himself as being treated unfairly.   \nHR professional \n \nThis was elegantly summed up by one CEO: \nIf salaries for the average FTSE chief executive were half as much, then relative to each \nother, they would still be more concerned about that relativity than they would about \nwhether it's half. \nCEO \nThis links back to the use of executive pay surveys discussed earlier.  It highlights the \nfact that fairness in pay is defined in a relative manner, rather than as an absolute. \n \n(c) Fairness between executives and workers lower down the hierarchy  \n 18\nAlthough the pay multiple between executives and other employees is the focus of much \nexternal comment (for example Moules, 2004), interviewees varied in their attitudes to \nhow much this mattered. \n \nOne interviewee had strong views about the need to consider pay rates throughout the \ncompany: \nEvery statement talks about people being our most important asset, etc.  It's about time the \nfeet followed the words, quite frankly.  In this company our executive pay is probably 8 to 9 \ntimes the average pay in the company.  I think that\u2019s probably justifiable, maybe about right.  \nBut when you get to the kinds of levels that you're talking about in some companies, how \nare you going to motivate people to feel part of the team, part of the enterprise, something \nyou can actually relate to and invest your discretionary effort in?  Because that's what \nyou're trying to capture in the way you manage people.  It's giving the extra bit of effort. \nHR professional \nHowever, such remarks were not common, and it was more usual for interviewees to \ncomment that the pay differential through the organisation was not a matter for the \ncommittee to consider.  This was explained by one committee chairman as follows. \nOh, I don't think we've got those sort of formula [relating executive pay to average or \nminimum wages] in place.  Because I think the top end is driven by assessment of what the \nmarket would pay for that post, and probably the next 50 posts below that are also market \nrelated.  The bottom end is related to the annual pay round, and that's mainly inflation \nlinked rather than comparator linked.  And then the bits in the middle get sorted out in a \nsimilar way.  But we do obviously - one of the debates we had when we were setting \n[CEO\u2019s] salary last year was how is this going to be viewed by the guy [working on the \nshopfloor]?  Can we justify it to him?  That was very much in the conversation.  So it's \n 19\ncertainly not done in isolation.  But the top is driven by market forces and the bottom end is \ndriven by national pay and conditions, which are going on at the time. \nCommittee chairman \n \nIn the light of the earlier discussion on the need to retain good executives, such comments \nare understandable, even if they have led to the disassociation of executive pay levels \nfrom those of other employees.  In the discussion of fairness, perceived commercial \nimperatives meant that fairness between different hierarchical levels of the company was \nregarded as less significant than fairness to executives and shareholders. \n \nThe use of performance-related pay \nAs discussed earlier, executive remuneration in the UK generally comprises a base salary \nplus both short- and long-term performance-related elements (New Bridge Street, 2004a, \n2004b).  The short-term element, normally an annual bonus scheme, will often include \nboth corporate and individual performance targets.  The longer-term elements might \ninclude a share option scheme or another form of long-term incentive plan (\u2018ltip\u2019), often \nusing restricted shares.  In addition, executives might receive perks and a pension.  The \nresearch focus was on the salary, bonus and long-term remuneration; in common with \nmuch other research in this field (e.g. Murphy, 1999:  2517; Werner and Ward, 2004:  \n217), little attention was paid to perks and pensions. \n \nThe use of performance-related pay (PRP) is ubiquitous in UK listed companies (New \nBridge Street, 2004a,2004b).  Various reasons are given for this (Bender, 2004), \n 20\nincluding the desire to motivate performance, the need to be fair to employees, good HR \npractice, and the need for corporate legitimacy.  But does PRP encourage good \nbehaviour? \n \nFrey and Osterloh (2005) argue persuasively that using a high level of PRP results in \nmanagers acting selfishly and against the shareholders\u2019 interests.  Citing Enron, \nWorldCom, etc, they suggest that PRP is one factor that has caused some of the corporate \nfrauds and excesses of recent times.  They argue that companies should focus on \nintrinsically motivated corporate virtue rather than relying on externally-provided \nincentives. \n \nA quote from one of the interviewees, whilst not typical of other conversations, illustrates \na problem of such variable pay: \nHuman nature is very variable from individual to individual.  So how they work differently, at \nits worst, will be people become overly obsessed with what their reward is and what is \nrequired to deliver that.  And that might not always be in the best interests of the \norganisation as a whole.  And the obvious example of that -- well, there's several of them -- \nbut in retail you fight for floorspace.  And you might wish to have more floorspace than \nsomebody else so as to deliver your sales targets, even though somebody else might get a \nbetter return from it.  The other one that's common, I'm not saying that it happens a lot \nhere, but I'm sure it did a bit last year, is that if you're well in excess of your target coming \nup to year-end then you might as well bring forward some of your costs and spend some \nmoney, which of course depresses the overall profit but still means your area is okay.  By \ndepressing the overall profit you can actually have an adverse effect on somebody else.   \nCompany secretary \n 21\n As stated, such comments about PRP were rare, and indeed, that interviewee went on to \ndiscuss his belief that most individuals do see the wider picture, to benefit the \norganisation. \n \nOne finding of the research was that remuneration packages and policies are often \nchanged, particularly if the PRP elements do not pay out, or pay out too little (Bender, \n2005).  An argument made to justify this follows expectancy theory (Vroom, 1964;  \nLawler, 1991), which maintains that PRP will only motivate if (a) the employee sees the \namount to be earned as worthwhile, (b) believes that the award will be paid if the targets \nare achieved, and (c) considers those targets to be achievable.  The research findings \nshowed instances of changes to pay schemes for both (a) and (c), with the amount of \npotential reward being increased, and measures or targets being amended if they were \nunlikely to be met.   \n \nOne HR professional justified such changes with the comment that: \nThe committee decided that to have something that frankly was not incentivising was a \nweak and blunt instrument. \nIn the same vein, the minutes for another company noted that:  \n\u2026 the committee was of the view that the restricted share plan in its present form was not \nincentivising\u2026 \n \n 22\nIn both companies the schemes were subsequently changed.  Whilst this makes sense \nfrom a motivational viewpoint, it could create a moral hazard if employees come to \nexpect that under-performing will lead to targets being restated.   \n \nAn issue relating to this changing of schemes and targets is the re-pricing of share options \nthat are underwater.  This practice is not common in the UK, and of all the interviewees, \nonly one was fully in favour of re-pricing;  the rest were mostly against.  However, as \nthese out-of-the-money options were often supplemented by the issue of new share \noptions at the lower current price, there is a strong argument that this too can create a \nmoral hazard, as the executives end up holding the new, cheaper options as well as the \noriginals (Arya and Sun, 2004). \n \nMeasuring and reporting total shareholder return  \nA commonly-used performance measure for ltips is total shareholder return (TSR).  This \nmeasures the return to shareholders over a fixed period (commonly three years) and \ncompares this to the TSR from a group of comparable companies, or an index.  Normally, \nif a company earns TSR lower than the median of its group, the ltip shares will not vest;  \nvesting is in proportion to the company\u2019s position on a TSR ranking, with full vesting for \nupper quartile performance.   \n \nA problem with TSR is that the company may be at the mercy of market sentiment, \nparticularly if it benchmarks against an index such as the FTSE 100 and is in an out-of-\nfavour sector.  Also, share prices can move for reasons unconnected with the directors\u2019 or \n 23\ncompany\u2019s performance:  one HR director complained that although his company\u2019s share \nprice had risen on the delivery of their own good results, it had then fallen because a \ncompetitor released bad news into the market.  This had no effect on his company\u2019s \nperformance, but did affect their TSR.   \n \nThe interviewees were very aware of this problem, and commented that this performance \nmeasure, the use of which is often seen as good governance because it reflects what the \nshareholders receive, can be de-motivating for executives who may have little control \nover it.  One consultant reflected other interviewees in his comment: \nBut the longer you go out, I think the less sharp an incentive it is.  Particularly when it\u2019s \nshare price, there are so many different factors that are going to influence what the share \nprice does. \nConsultant \n \nAnother impact of TSR, not directly commented upon by any interviewee, is that the \nreverse can happen, and executives can receive an undeserved reward.  For example, \nwhen Philip Purcell left his job as Morgan Stanley's chief executive the share price rose \nsignificantly (Partnoy, 2005):  he would be able to sell his shares at a greater profit, solely \nbecause the market was pleased by the change of management. \n \nA further problem with TSR is that it is complex to calculate.  This has two impacts.  One \nis an HR problem in that it can be difficult to motivate executives based on a measure \nthey do not fully understand, and against which they cannot easily determine progress.  \n 24\nAlso, the TSR figures can be manipulated.  Such manipulation can be in two ways.  One \nNED, an ex finance director himself, pointed out that the company executives could time \nwhen to issue news to the market to guide expectations, thus managing the share price at \nthe margin (as discussed by Aboody and Kasznik, 2000).  And a consultant pointed out \nthat the calculation of TSR can be done in various ways (e.g. spot prices or average \nprices) to lead to different results.  (In fairness, that consultant also pointed out that his \nfirm does not revise the TSR calculation methodology to suit executives\u2019 wishes.) \n \nThus an apparently objective measure, theoretically aligned with value for shareholders, \nmay not be as useful as it first appears. \n \nJensen (2004) writes about the agency costs of overvalued equity and points out that \nexecutives whose shares are overvalued have an incentive to defend that unrealistic share \nprice, which can lead to fraud or bad practices.  Compensation that is based in any way \non the share price (including share options) will only exacerbate this. \n \nA further point on TSR is relevant.  The Report Regulations (DTI, 2002) demand that \ncompanies disclose a chart showing the TSR of the company over a five year period \nagainst the TSR of an appropriate index (e.g. the FTSE 100).  Although such disclosure is \nuseful to investors, in practice there could be an adverse effect.  Although the graph is for \na five year period (which sits oddly with the reality that most companies\u2019 long-term \nschemes are for three years), a new graph will be produced each year, for the preceding \nfive years.  Thus it is not necessarily the company\u2019s long term shareholder value that is \n 25\nbeing managed but, possibly, its short term share price, with the need to show a \nsatisfactory chart each year.   \n \nEven if there were no need to display a chart, this problem might still exist.  Best practice \nis to make a new award every year under the long-term scheme (options or ltips).  This \nmakes good sense, as it averages out movements in a cyclical business, and provides a \n\u2018handcuff\u2019 to retain executives who always have two years\u2019 incentives to come.  \nNevertheless, it means that a three-year period ends each year, with the incentive to \nmanage the year\u2019s performance to trigger vesting of each separate award. \n \nPerformance measures:  disclosure and conformity \nAn agency theory approach (Jensen and Meckling, 1976) implies that managers will \nstrive to meet the relevant performance criteria in order to achieve additional reward.  \nMany (for example Davis et al., 1997;  McConvill, 2005) would argue with this basic \npremise, taking exception to the one-dimensional view of Economic Man driven only by \nfinancial reward.  We have great sympathy with these views.  However, given the reality \nthat much of the regulation surrounding executive remuneration appears to be driven by \nan agency theory approach, we ground our analysis in that school of thought. \n \nIn order for performance-related pay to be beneficial to the company, the performance \ncriteria must be valid.  This means, in particular, that the measures must be suitable for \nthe business, and the targets must be appropriate to the corporate goals.  Measures that \nare mis-aligned will lead to executives acting in a way that does not add value;  targets \n 26\nthat are too low will not enhance performance, and those that are unrealistically high will \ndemotivate.  Thus, setting appropriate measures and targets is one of the most challenging \naspects of pay design (Gomez-Mejia and Wiseman, 1997). \n \nThe interviewees were aware of these issues, and many commented on the need to \nbalance short and long term incentives, and to balance financial and non-financial \nmeasures. \n \nThere are two particular issues peculiar to the design of executive incentives that relate to \nbest practice in corporate governance:  the need for disclosure of performance measures;  \nand the desire for conformity, to establish the legitimacy of a remuneration policy. \n \nThe Report Regulations (DTI, 2002) state that details must be given of performance \nmeasures and targets relating to share options or other long-term incentive schemes.  \nSuch details should include an explanation of why these conditions were chosen and \nmethods of assessing performance against these conditions.  Furthermore, the Combined \nCode (2003:  B2.4) states that companies must obtain the agreement of investors for their \nlong term incentive schemes, which means that a dialogue will be entered into with key \nshareholder and institutional bodies.   \n \nThis disclosure of performance measures and targets represents good governance \npractice, and has many advantages for investors. For example, Buckley (2004) discusses \nhow J. Sainsbury, a UK supermarket chain, withdrew its chairman\u2019s bonus because \n 27\ninvestors argued that the underlying targets were insufficiently stretching.  Without \nsufficient disclosure, this institutional action might have been less effective. \n \nHowever, such disclosure can have unexpected consequences.  One case company was \nreluctant to link measures and targets very closely with the corporate strategic plan.  They \nargued that although such linkage could be good for performance, confidentiality \nconcerns meant that they were not prepared to share this information with shareholders, \nand so could not use the measures. \n \nAnother aspect of the institutional interest in performance measures came in discussions \nat one company about a pending change to a scheme.  Previous years\u2019 bonus measures \nhad included a subjective assessment by the remuneration committee as to how well the \nexecutives had done in the round.  This was being changed, replaced with more objective \nmeasures.  An interviewee suggested that the changes were not necessarily to the benefit \nof the company, but done in order to increase the legitimacy of the plan in the eyes of \n\u2018box tickers\u2019 in the institutions.   \n \nThis perceived preference for \u2018hard\u2019 measures is also shown in the reluctance of some \ncompanies to use broader measures of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in executive \npay.  Although all of the utilities had such measures (as mentioned earlier, they are \nrequired to do so under the utilities acts), some other companies chose only to measure \nfinancials.  In a discussion with the HR manager of a company which appeared to have a \nstrong (unmeasured) CSR ethos, the following explanation was given for this. \n 28\nIt hasn't come up as a common discussion point in terms of moving towards some form of \nbalanced scorecard.  I think one of the reasons is that there is a lot of scepticism within and \nwithout the company in terms of valid measurement and calibration.  And in many ways the \npressures that are being put on remuneration committees in order to only pay for \nperformance would mean that you actually probably want schemes where there is as little \ndiscretion as possible.  And with those sort of plans, unless you begin to start seriously \nmeasuring intangibles, which you can do of course....  Let's say that you'd wanted to \nrecognise that we\u2019d introduced a major board committee for corporate social responsibility, \nand that the board itself ought to have 20 percent of its annual incentive reward on how we \ndo against these measures.  We\u2019d then have to define the measures, get agreement on \nthem, calibrate them.  And then if they are not clearly quantifiable have a way of working \nout how well people have done. \nHR professional \n \nIt is thus possible that the design of executive pay schemes means that CSR issues are \nbeing side-lined in some companies;  good governance practice leading to an outcome \nthat many stakeholders might find undesirable. \n \nSurveys by New Bridge Street (2004a, 2004b) show how similar performance measures \nare throughout the FTSE 350.  One question asked of all the interviewees in this study \nwas whether, if they found a measure that was perfect for the company but totally unique, \nthey would use it for their executive remuneration packages.  Many were nervous of such \nnovelty as it would be difficult to explain to the remuneration committee (by the HR \nprofessionals) and to the institutions (by the committee).  Indeed, an institutional \nrepresentative commented that they would be suspicious of any new measures \u2013 \u201cthere\u2019s \n 29\nan instinctive tendency to mistrust new measures and then to analyse them away until \nthey resemble more traditional schemes\u201d.  The following comment is typical. \nWell I think we would...  I'm just thinking about the committee, and how it responds to \ninnovation.  I think the committee would be prepared to consider, I'm not saying we'd \nnecessarily do it.  But I think we'd look.  It would need to be something very special, clearly.  \nAnd something which I felt that we could actually go to the City and explain and they would \nfind acceptable.  But I would have thought that there's a lot of companies out there, and if \nthere were these sort of novel things around, people would have thought of them by now. \nCompany chairman \n \nThus it can be seen that at the executive director level performance measures may be \nchosen that are not necessarily the most appropriate to meet the company\u2019s objectives, \nbut do confer legitimacy and avoid disclosure of sensitive information. \n \nIn addition to determining the proportion of directors\u2019 remuneration that is to be \nperformance-related, and the measures to use, remuneration committees need to ensure \nperformance targets  are set that will motivate directors towards desired performance.  \nThis is not always easy:  many studies (e.g. Healy, 1985; Murphy, 2001) indicate that \nperformance targets may be gamed, and so not achieve their desired outcomes.  \nFurthermore, Jensen (2003) gives examples of how paying people for budget-based \ntargets can lead to false budgets and poor business decisions.  Although most \ninterviewees stated that this did not happen in their companies, one did suggest that there \nmight be an impact. \n 30\nSo when the operating plan is set, you will end with, in very loose terms, a profit target for \nthe year end.  And that profit target will be the one against which your achieved level of \nbonus will be, and then there will be a sliding scale up from that, in excess of that.  So there \nis a disincentive to have too stretching a profit target, because it will very quickly be \npotentially demotivating if you know you've not hit it.  But it does mean that if you just took \naway all thoughts of reward, if suddenly you could change somebody's mind and say I only \nwant to operate for the good of the company and the shareholders, then I'm not sure you'd \ncome up with exactly the same operating plan. \nCompany secretary \n \nA further issue as regards performance targets mirrors the fact mentioned earlier that \nmany companies have the same performance measures.  Many also have the same targets, \nfor example as regards growth in earnings per share as a measure attached to the vesting \nof share options (New Bridge Street Consultants, 2004b).  Such similarity of targets is \ninappropriate given that companies face different growth conditions and different stock \nmarket expectations.  Often, merely achieving the targets set will not add value for \nshareholders (Conyon et al., 2000:  494) despite the fact that the company appears to be \nfollowing best practice. \n \nExecutive shareholdings \nOne of the arguments of agency theory is that share ownership by the executives can \nreduce the underlying agency problem.  This is borne out in studies such as those by \nHermalin and Weisbach (1991) or Morck et al. (1988), both of whom find that, up to a \ncertain level, company performance increases with executive share ownership.  Thus \n 31\nexecutive share ownership is widely seen as a good thing.  In line with this approach, the \nCombined Code (2003, Schedule A) encourages the holding of company shares by \nexecutives, and it is becoming common for companies to devise ways of facilitating this.  \nOf the 12 case companies, four had definite rules for executive shareholdings (for \nexample, that the CEO should hold shares valued at at least twice his\/her salary) and two \nhad a voluntary guideline.  \n \nIn nine companies an element of the annual bonus had to be deferred into shares in the \ncompany, which would vest in two or three years, often with the company adding a \nmatching number of shares if certain performance targets were met.  This too was \ndesigned to align executives with shareholders: \nWe felt that that would demonstrate externally a much stronger commitment to the business \nif you had to invest in the first place into it. \nHR professional \n \nAlthough both types of scheme result in the executives holding shares it is interesting to \nnote that they have different shapes and can led to different outcomes.  One remuneration \nconsultant summed this up when discussing a share-match scheme: \nAnd the last one was to put in an arrangement which encouraged people, in fact required \npeople to invest some of their bonus in the company's shares.  And that gave them a better \nalignment with shareholders, but gave them an awful lot of upside if they did well with the  \nbusiness. \nConsultant \n 32\n Because the share match can lead to a much greater shareholding, theory suggests that it \nshould provide a greater incentive, and it might give executives more of an incentive to \ntake risks than would the simple ownership of shares.  This may in some instances be \nseen as a good thing.  Shareholders (although not other stakeholders such as employees) \nquite often want executives to take risks, to complement their own diversified investment \nstrategies.   \n \nHowever, financial theory suggests that it is illogical to demand that executives, with \nundiversified jobs, hold a great part of their wealth tied up in their own companies.  \nAlthough this does appear to align them with shareholders, to quote one interviewee, \u201cno \nsane investment advisor would suggest that at all\u201d.  An executive in a failing company, \nwhose personal wealth was significantly tied to that company\u2019s share price performance, \nmay have an incentive to distort results:  the example of Bernie Ebbers at WorldCom may \nillustrate this (Bebchuk and Fried, 2003;  Sonnenfeld, 2004). \n \nFurthermore, as mentioned earlier when discussing TSR, executives have the ability to \nmanipulate share price at the margin.  They are also able to time share awards or option \nexercises to benefit their own personal wealth.  For example, Yermack (1997) found, in a \nUS study, that option awards were timed to coincide with favourable movements in stock \nprices.  Thus schemes which are designed to award shares or options to executives, with \nthe aim of increasing their shareholdings, can be gamed. \n \n 33\nDiscussion and conclusions:  Does best practice encourage good behaviour?  \nThis paper addresses the issue of how setting executive pay in accordance with good \ngovernance practice can influence the executives\u2019 behaviour, either for good or \notherwise.  It does this by presenting the results of interview-based research with 40 \nparticipants, representing 12 FTSE 350 companies and some other protagonists in the \nexecutive pay debate in the UK.  The nature of the research is such that the companies \nand interviewees only agreed to participate if they had an interest in corporate \ngovernance, the implication being that those concerned believe their governance practices \nto be good.  Accordingly, the research results are not, and were never intended to be, \ngeneralisable to a wider population, but they do show how \u2018best practice\u2019 has been \noperationalised in specific companies. \n \nThis paper builds on a vast body of statistical research in the field, and adds to the body \nof knowledge by providing a rich insight into the executive remuneration-setting process, \nshowing in detail the considerations that remuneration committees need to address and \nthe problems they face.   \n \nBest practice in setting executive pay requires market benchmarking of pay levels, a \nsignificant performance-related element in the pay structure, objective performance \nmeasures, and substantial disclosure.  These structures have all been adopted for valid \nreasons, to encourage transparency in this critical area of corporate governance, and to \nalign executive behaviour with the needs of the company.  But the findings of this \nresearch indicate that these practices, whilst no doubt addressing some problems with \n 34\ngovernance, have also led to a continued upward ratchet in pay, and pay structures and \nperformance measures that can be gamed, and may have less to do with a company\u2019s \nstrategic objectives than with gaining legitimacy in the eyes of key stakeholders.   \n \nGood behaviour means that the remuneration scheme will drive behaviour that meets the \nneeds of the stakeholders in the most appropriate way for the company\u2019s circumstances.  \nIt further implies that the behaviours that the scheme is trying to influence will in fact \ndeliver the outcomes sought.  In practice, in this paper, \u2018good\u2019 behaviour mainly \naddresses the needs of shareholders, although other direct stakeholders (e.g. employees \nand customers) are considered.   \n \nThe findings of this research show that the process by which board remuneration is set \nhas been driven by corporate governance requirements.  As such there is the risk that \nremuneration becomes homogenised in order to be legitimate and that there is little focus \non the specific objectives on the firm.  Further, companies with a desire to act for the \nbenefit of a wider range of stakeholders may be constrained by the need to adopt \nrecognisable performance measures rather than specifically-tailored CSR measures. \n \n\u2018Long term\u2019 schemes generally run for only three years, often less than a complete \nbusiness cycle.  This is compounded by the fact that a new long term incentive is awarded \nevery year, and performance graphs are produced for each five-year period, which means \nthat the long term focus can in fact be compromised by the need to reach a series of short \nterm goals.  The focus on performance-related pay can lead to an unhealthy focus on the \n 35\nshare price or profits, as can the requirement for executives to hold a proportion of their \nwealth in their own companies, thus limiting their diversification opportunities and \nincreasing their personal risk.   \n \nThere remains the issue of whether the total level of pay is fair, and to whom.  Fairness is \na relative term, rather than an absolute:  there is no correct number for executive pay. We \nfound that in practice, \u2018fairness\u2019 mostly means fairness to the executive in comparison to \nhis\/her peers \u2013 this drives the amount needed to pay what it takes to get and retain the \nright individual.  Thus a purported market seems to determine the remuneration level \u2013 \nwhether or not society agrees that this is fair.   \n \nMany of the recent developments in corporate governance have been introduced to drive \nout certain bad behaviours \u2013 yet this does not guarantee \u2018good\u2019 behaviour.  Compliance \nwith regulation does not ensure an ethical approach, and even a well-intentioned scheme \ncan result in dysfunctional behaviour by executives.  Indeed, one of the interviewees \nreferred to an effective performance-related pay system as the equivalent of the Holy \nGrail \u2013 something much sought-after but not yet found. \n \nThis study does not find evidence that current practice in corporate governance always \ndrives bad behaviour;  but it does show that the system results in incentives that could \nlead executives towards behaviours that are not in the interests of shareholders or other \nstakeholders.   In summary, we conclude that best practice might drive good behaviour, \n 36\nbut strict adherence to an ever-increasing range of governance regulations means that this \nrelationship should not be taken for granted. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe financial support of the P D Leake Trust (a charity associated with the ICAEW) is \ngratefully acknowledged.

Outside directors are known as \u2018non-executive directors\u2019 \nii The interviews were focused around the following questions:  (A)  Your thoughts on the debate about the \nlevel and structure of executive directors\u2019 remuneration  (6 questions addressing issues of level and \nstructure, performance and motivation);   (B)  How the company arrived at its remuneration policies  (11 \nquestions addressing the conduct of committee meetings, the roles of the different parties, matters \nconsidered and then rejected, time lines of decisions, comparative pay throughout the organisation);  and \n(C)  How the company\u2019s remuneration policies compare to other companies of which you are aware  (3 \nquestions addressing level and structure of pay, and \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019 practice).  Interviewees were also asked \nto complete a short questionnaire, ranking the various factors that might impact on their pay decisions (e.g.  \ncompany size, profitability, strategy, individual director needs, etc.) \niii Eisenhardt (1989) states that in case study research, where the focus is on understanding the dynamics \npresent in single settings, there is no ideal number of cases for a study (such as there might be in statistical \nanalysis), but that a number between four and ten usually works well. \niv It was primarily the generous packages awarded to directors of the newly-privatised utilities that led to \nthe setting up on the Greenbury study group, which produced its influential report on directors\u2019 \nremuneration in 1995.  Utility directors suffered at that time from the \u2018fat cat\u2019 label, although much has \nchanged in the sector since then.  Furthermore, current legislation governing the utilities demands that they \ndisclose how (if at all) executive remuneration is linked to operational service standards, the aim being to \nencourage such a link.  Four utilities were included in the 12 case companies.  The utility interviewees were \n 45\n                                                                                                                                         \nvery aware of their companies\u2019 \u2018fat cat\u2019 history, but otherwise there were no other differences between the \nutilities and other case companies. \nv The exact number of companies approached is unknown to the authors, as the group of remuneration \nprofessionals was circularised by the interviewee contact and we had no access to their details.  25 \ncompanies were contacted directly by the researchers. \nvi One could of course argue that any scheme that was due to pay out despite such an erosion of shareholder \nvalue was poorly designed anyway.  However, that is not the focus of this paper. \n 46\n"}
