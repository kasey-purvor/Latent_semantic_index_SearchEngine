The views and conclusions contained herein are the author\u2019s and shouldn\u2019t be interpreted as necessarily representing the official policies or endorsements, either expressed or implied, of other parties.The Collaborative Operations for Personnel Recovery (Co-OPR) project sought to\\ud\nprovide collaborative task support for a Search and Rescue coordination center. The\\ud\nproject aimed to create a prototype \u201cPersonnel Recovery (Experimental) Pack\u201d (PREP) and to demonstrate its use.\\ud\n\\ud\nA number of requirements capture, knowledge gathering and transition workshops and\\ud\nmeetings were held. This included an initial requirements setting workshop early in 2005,\\ud\nmeetings at the USJFCOM Joint Personnel Recovery Agency\u2019s (JPRA) Personnel\\ud\nRecovery Education and Training Center (PRETC) in Fredericksburg, Virginia in June\\ud\n2005, a review meeting in Edinburgh in August 2005, and attendance at a Command Post\\ud\nExercise (CPX) at the PRETC in November 2005. These initially established the potential\\ud\nareas for use of Co-OPR and I-X tools in training exercises. In the second project year such tools were developed and tested using a training exercise as held at the PRETC, using observers from PRETC and USJFCOM and an evaluation expert from USJFCOM\/J9.\\ud\n\\ud\nThe project was provided with a rich set of urban and rural scenarios by JPRA\/PRETC\\ud\nwhich together are unclassified versions of scenarios used within the PRETC training\\ud\ncourses and Command Post Exercises. At the time, these stretched the capabilities of the\\ud\ncurrent and envisaged technologies within Co-OPR\/I-X. Refinement of the scenarios\\ud\nalongside PRETC, and knowledge engineering to capture information on standard operating procedures and responses were a key part of making the work relevant to the potential real use of Co-OPR\/I-X for Personnel Recovery.\\ud\n\\ud\nThe core I-X technology was packaged into a number of checkpoint releases to make\\ud\navailable the features required to meet the application needs. I-X version 4.3 released in November 2005 to checkpoint the results achieved on the first 12 months of work with\\ud\nthe PRETC. It formed a basis for the work on really using the technology at the PRETC.\\ud\nNew \u201cwhite cell\u201d aids for training were made available in an initial version. A new I-Sim\\ud\nsimulation capability, and advanced option exploration tools have all been improved\\ud\nsignificantly to make them more usable, including the features of the I-Plan AI planner and its capability for plan repair after failures. The features of the Domain Editor (I-DE) and its ability to browse and update or augment standard operating procedure knowledge dynamically during missions were enhanced. The final release of I-X that includes all the new developments achieved in the Co-OPR project is version 4.5.\\ud\n\\ud\nThe results of the work were packaged, along with Personnel Recovery domain specific\\ud\nmodels, as a web site and\/or CD which could be considered as a prototype \u201cPersonnel\\ud\nRecovery (Experimental) Pack\u201d of tools to assist a Joint Personnel Recovery Center\\ud\n(JPRC) and associated operational staff in performing their operations. The versions of\\ud\nPREP produced were used in one workshop or Command Post Exercise at the PRETC\\ud\nunder guidance from Dr. Jeff Hansberger at training related workshops already organized\\ud\nby USJFCOM\/J9 Expt. and Fred Kleibacker, the (now former) Director of the PRETC in\\ud\nFredericksburg, Virginia.

The\\ud\nproject aimed to create a prototype \u201cPersonnel Recovery (Experimental) Pack\u201d (PREP) and to demonstrate its use.\\ud\n\\ud\nA number of requirements capture, knowledge gathering and transition workshops and\\ud\nmeetings were held. This included an initial requirements setting workshop early in 2005,\\ud\nmeetings at the USJFCOM Joint Personnel Recovery Agency\u2019s (JPRA) Personnel\\ud\nRecovery Education and Training Center (PRETC) in Fredericksburg, Virginia in June\\ud\n2005, a review meeting in Edinburgh in August 2005, and attendance at a Command Post\\ud\nExercise (CPX) at the PRETC in November 2005. These initially established the potential\\ud\nareas for use of Co-OPR and I-X tools in training exercises. In the second project year such tools were developed and tested using a training exercise as held at the PRETC, using observers from PRETC and USJFCOM and an evaluation expert from USJFCOM\/J9.\\ud\n\\ud\nThe project was provided with a rich set of urban and rural scenarios by JPRA\/PRETC\\ud\nwhich together are unclassified versions of scenarios used within the PRETC training\\ud\ncourses and Command Post Exercises. At the time, these stretched the capabilities of the\\ud\ncurrent and envisaged technologies within Co-OPR\/I-X. Refinement of the scenarios\\ud\nalongside PRETC, and knowledge engineering to capture information on standard operating procedures and responses were a key part of making the work relevant to the potential real use of Co-OPR\/I-X for Personnel Recovery.\\ud\n\\ud\nThe core I-X technology was packaged into a number of checkpoint releases to make\\ud\navailable the features required to meet the application needs. I-X version 4.3 released in November 2005 to checkpoint the results achieved on the first 12 months of work with\\ud\nthe PRETC. It formed a basis for the work on really using the technology at the PRETC.\\ud\nNew \u201cwhite cell\u201d aids for training were made available in an initial version. A new I-Sim\\ud\nsimulation capability, and advanced option exploration tools have all been improved\\ud\nsignificantly to make them more usable, including the features of the I-Plan AI planner and its capability for plan repair after failures. The features of the Domain Editor (I-DE) and its ability to browse and update or augment standard operating procedure knowledge dynamically during missions were enhanced. The final release of I-X that includes all the new developments achieved in the Co-OPR project is version 4.5.\\ud\n\\ud\nThe results of the work were packaged, along with Personnel Recovery domain specific\\ud\nmodels, as a web site and\/or CD which could be considered as a prototype \u201cPersonnel\\ud\nRecovery (Experimental) Pack\u201d of tools to assist a Joint Personnel Recovery Center\\ud\n(JPRC) and associated operational staff in performing their operations. The versions of\\ud\nPREP produced were used in one workshop or Command Post Exercise at the PRETC\\ud\nunder guidance from Dr. Jeff Hansberger at training related workshops already organized\\ud\nby USJFCOM\/J9 Expt. and Fred Kleibacker, the (now former) Director of the PRETC in\\ud\nFredericksburg, Virginia. Co-OPR team members were engaged with these workshops to\\ud\nto show the tools in realistic settings, to assist with training where possible, and to gather experimental feedback.\\ud\n\\ud\nRealistic use of tools for Personnel Recovery requires that the systems can work with\\ud\nemerging technology for geo-positioning, survival radios, evasion aids, robotic or semiautomated rescue aids or robots, and doctrine or tactics, techniques and procedures for Personnel Recovery. A number of short studies of these \u201ccomplementary technologies\u201d were made which explored deployment and inter-working aspects of these with the Co-OPR\/I-X technology.<\/dc:description><dc:date>\n2008-05-05T11:08:35Z<\/dc:date><dc:date>\n2008-05-05T11:08:35Z<\/dc:date><dc:date>\n2007-08-31<\/dc:date><dc:type>\nTechnical Report<\/dc:type><dc:identifier>\nTate, A., Dalton, J., Stader, J., Wickler, G. and Hansberger, J.
