Introduction \nGlass is mainly used as a substrate material due to its advantages over polymers and metals, namely \nits high strength and generally lighter weight as compared to metallic materials. It also retains its \nstrength to relatively higher temperatures and is less susceptible to oxidation and corrosion at these \nelevated temperatures. But, it is primarily the optical properties of glass which make the material \ninteresting to use and therefore coat. Another main advantage of glass, in terms of material \ndeposition, is its ability to cope with the stresses created by the adhering of a new atomic structure.  \nThin films of optical and ferro-electric materials have acquired considerable importance in recent \ntimes in view of their impact on the emerging as well as future technologies. Films of SnO2, for \nexample, have gained importance because of their use in opto-electronic devices, solar energy \nconverters, light-transmitting electrodes, liquid crystals, heat mirrors, gas sensors, etc. [1]. SnO2 has \ntraditionally been coated onto glass mainly as a base for glass-to-metal seals due to its good wetting \nbehaviour [2]. Within the electronics industry the deposition of SnO2 on glass has found many uses, \nprimarily nowadays being used on inorganic glasses to produce LCD displays on portable computers \n[3]. Thin SnO2 films are also used extensively in solar energy converters as conducting buffer layers \nto improve electric conductivity with low resistivity [4]. Within the aerospace industry, SnO2 is \ncoated onto various plastic substrates. This coating can range from high resistance coatings on \npolyamide film or FEP film, for static dissipative uses as resistant static discharges. The coatings are \nalso used for electromagnetic interference shielding on windows [5]. A limited amount of evidence of \nthe application of Sn and SnO2 coatings in fields of gas sensing [6], biomedicine [7] and the \nautomotive industry [8] can also be found.  \nAt present, the coating of Sn and SnO2 on glass for the above applications has traditionally been \nachieved by means of a number of mechanical: sputtering, spin deposition and plasma spraying, [9, \n10] and physical methods: ion implantation and sol-gel processing [11, 12]. In more recent times, \nhowever, the use of lasers to directly and indirectly melt and fuse metals onto many substrates, \nincluding glass, has been investigated. The laser deposition of Sn and SnO2 on glass derives from the \nneed to control the interface between the two surfaces. Consequently the laser is an ideal tool for this \ntask since it can deliver a high power beam to the interface without changing the bulk substrate \ndramatically [13]. Both laser chemical vapour deposition (LCVD) [14] and laser physical vapour \ndeposition (LPVD) [15] have been shown to be viable techniques. Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) has \n been employed successfully to deposit thin films (100-1000 \u00c5) of indium tin oxide (ITO) onto glass \nsubstrates with a KrF excimer laser [16]. The laser spraying of metallic particles onto various \nsubstrates has been studied [17], but the technique is not without attendant problems as the particles \nrequire certain properties for the phenomenon of evaporation induced propulsion to be realised. The \npossibility of pre-placed powder deposition with CO2 and Nd:YAG lasers has also been investigated \n[17]. However, due to the lasers\u2019 characteristics, much difficulty in achieving low dilution fusion \nbecause of the small operating window was experienced. \nThis present work describes the hitherto unreported successful demonstration of the selective \ndeposition of a relatively thick tin oxide layer on ubiquitous soda-lime-silica glass and fused silica \nglass using a HPDL in normal atmospheric conditions. The required laser operating parameters are \ngiven. Furthermore, the bonding and adhesion mechanisms involved in the process are \ncomprehensively investigated, thus elucidating the reasons for successful deposition. It is believed \nthat the technique presented in this paper is a useful addition to the burgeoning applications base of \nthe HPDL. \n2. Experimental procedures \nThe laser used in the study was a surgical HPDL (Diomed, Inc.), emitting at 940 nm and operating in \nthe continuous wave (CW) mode with rated optical powers ranging from 0-120 W. The HPDL beam \nwas delivered to the work area by means of a 4 m long, 600 \u00b5m core diameter optical fibre, the end of \nwhich was connected to a 2:1 focusing lens assembly mounted on the z-axis of a 3-axis CNC gantry \ntable. The samples were irradiated using the defocused high order mode HPDL beam with a beam \nspot diameter of 2 mm and laser powers (measured at the workpiece using a Power Wizard power \nmeter) of 10-55 W. The defocused HPDL beam was fired across the surfaces of the glasses selected \nwith the Sn and SnO2 pre-placed beneath on a mild steel substrate as shown in Fig. 1. The HPDL \nbeam was traversed over the surfaces of the samples using the x- and y-axis of the CNC gantry table \nat speeds ranging from 240-1440 mm min-1. The laser optics were protected by means of a coaxially \nblown O2 shield gas jet a rate of 3 l min\n-1. The glasses used as substrates for the work were fused \nsilica glass (99.9%fused) and the common soda-lime-silica glass. The metals deposited on the glasses \nwere pure Sn and SnO2 (Sn 78.77wt%, O2 21.23wt%). \n 3. Deposition of SnO2 on fused silica and soda-lime-silica glass \n3.1. Operating window \nFig. 2 depicts a schematic representation of the operating window for the deposition of SnO2 on both \nfused silica and soda-lime-silica glass. Within the optimum operating conditions (shaded area), the \ndeposition of lines of SnO2 which adhered well to the glass were possible. Furthermore, from Fig. 2 it \nis possible to ascertain the maximum deposition\/coverage rate that it may be possible to achieve \nusing the HPDL. This was calculated as being 3.72 m2 h-1 for a circular beam of 4 mm diameter with \na laser power of 110 W and a traverse speed of 1550 mm min-1. \n 3.2. Morphological characteristics \nThe typical surface morphology of deposited tracks of SnO2 on (a) fused silica and (b) soda-lime-\nsilica glass is shown in Fig. 3. As is evident from Fig. 3(a), the surface of the deposited SnO2 tracks \non the fused silica glass appear to be slightly undulated, with the undulations being regular in both \nperiodicity and intensity. In addition, the surface displays very few microcracks and no porosities. In \ncontrast, Fig. 3(b) shows that the surface of the deposited SnO2 tracks on the soda-lime-silica glass \nare considerably more irregular and uneven. In Fig. 3(a) the solidification structure appears to be of a \ndirectional nature. This directional solidification structure was seen typically to extend in a \nperpendicular direction from the edges of the laser melt track, tending inwards towards the centre of \nthe track. As one can see from Fig. 3(b), cracking of the surface of the deposited SnO2 tracks was an \nattendant problem. Cracks were found to occur in both the deposited SnO2 tracks and the soda-lime-\nsilica glass substrate. \n3.3. Microstructural characteristics \nThe typical cross-sectional microstructure around the interface between SnO2 and (a) fused silica and \n(b) soda-lime-silica glass is shown in Fig. 4. Both Fig. 4(a) and Fig. 4(b) show clearly that the \ndeposited SnO2 layer seems to be well bonded to the glass substrates. But, the methods of bonding \nbetween the SnO2 and the two substrates appear to be very different. From Fig. 4(a) is possible to \nclearly discern an interface region between the SnO2 and the fused silica glass substrate, while in Fig. \n4(b) the SnO2 layer appears to be mechanically bonded to the soda-lime-silica substrate.  \n \n 4. Deposition of Sn on fused silica and soda-lime-silica glass \nRegardless of the HPDL operating parameters, it proved impossible to deposit pure Sn on either a \nfused silica glass substrate or a common soda-lime-silica glass substrate. Indeed, HPDL interaction \nwith the Sn when placed on the surface of the soda-lime-silica glass simply resulted in the \u2018balling\u2019 of \nthe Sn; the formation of small spheres approximately the diameter of the laser beam itself. Indeed, \nsuch observations are in accord with those of Bourell et al. [18] and Agarwala et al. [19], who noted \nthe balling phenomena during the laser sintering of ceramic powders. Fig. 5 shows a typical surface \nview of the balling of Sn on soda-lime-silica glass. \n5. Discussion \n5.1. Morphological characteristics \nAs one can see from Fig. 3(b), cracking of the both the SnO2 deposited layer and the soda-lime-silica \nsubstrate were a common feature of the process. The formation of cracks can be attributed mainly to \nthermal stresses generated during HPDL irradiation. This is due to the fact that the thermal \nconductivity SnO2 is such that, during laser heating, a large thermal gradient between the melt zone \nand the substrate exists which results in thermal stresses. Additionally, despite the fact that the \nprocess of HPDL firing the SnO2 results from a high specific rate of energy which in turn facilitates \nlocalised melting of the SnO2, the fact that a certain amount of the heat will be conducted to sections \nof the deposited layer where the SnO2 is already solidified, combined with existence of a relatively \ncold soda-lime-silica glass substrate, means that thermal stresses will be generated. During the \nheating phase the stresses will be compressive and relieved by plastic deformation, thus precluding \ncrack formation. At high temperatures (T\u2265Tm) the stresses can also relieved [20]. On the other hand, \nduring cooling when the temperature falls below Tm, then stresses will accumulate. If the fracture \nstrength of the glass is exceeded then cracking within the melted layer will occur. The thermal stress, \n\u03c3, induced by a thermal gradient can be calculated using the Kingery equation:  \n  \u03c3\n\u03b1\n\u03c5\n=\n\u2212\nE T\u2206\n1\n  (1) \nwhere E is Young\u2019s modulus, \u2206T is the temperature change, \u03b1 is the coefficient of thermal expansion \nand \u03bd is Poisson\u2019s ratio. More succinctly, \u2206T is the difference between the critical temperature \n (below which stresses can no longer be relieved) and ambient temperature. For soda-lime-silica glass \nthis is the difference between the melting point of the metals, around 11000C [20] and ambient \ntemperature 200C. So, by using the following values for a typical soda-lime-silica glass: E=6.42 x 104 \nMN m-2, \u03b1=33 x 10-7 K-1, \u2206T=10800C and \u03bd=0.176, when the Sn and the SnO2 were irradiated by the \nHPDL beam the resulting thermal stress produced in the glass according to Equation (1) was around \n277 MN m-2. Since this is well in excess of the fracture strength of the glass, 120 MN m-2 [20], \ncracking will occur, and can only be avoided by severe distortion or through the reduction of \u2206T by \npre-heating.  \n5.2. Solidification microstructures \nAs can be seen from Fig. 6(a), the microstructure obtained on the edges of the deposited tracks \nappears to be of a fine, elongated cellular nature. In contrast, the microstructures typically observed \nin the centre of the deposited tracks, as shown in Fig. 6(b) appear to be semi-ordered dendritic \nstructures.  \nIt is evident from Fig. 6 that the solidification microstructures obtained differed across the same \ntrack. Such differences in microstructure within the same track result from the fact that at the edge of \nthe melt track the solidification rate, R, is low while the thermal gradient, G, is at its steepest, \ntherefore G\/R is high along the fusion line of the melt pool. Towards the centre of the melt zone the \nsolidification rate is increased while the thermal gradient is reduced. Consequently G\/R rapidly falls \noff as solidification proceeds towards the centre of the melt zone. Thus the high G\/R ratio at the \ninterface is just slightly less than that required for stability, that is the degree of constitutional \nsupercooling is smaller, thus different microstructures at the edges of the solidification melt tracks \ncan be formed [21-23]. \nIt is also worthy to note that the formation of the fine elongated structures at the edges of the \nsolidification tracks seen in Fig. 6(a) could be due to the fact that, although the HPDL beam is not \ntruly Gaussian in nature, the power intensity profile of the beam produces a temperature gradient \nperpendicular to the direction of traverse [24]. As such, the cooling rate, T, of the SnO2 will be much \nfaster on the edge of the laser track than in the centre, and may therefore give rise to the much finer \nand elongated microstructures observed on the edges of the deposited tracks. \nThe directionally-solidified nature of the microstructure observed on Fig. 3(a), which were seen to \nextend in a perpendicular direction from the edges of the laser melt track, tending inwards towards \n. \n the centre of the track, is thought to be due to the fact that the HPDL beam intensity is at a maximum \nin the centre of the profile [25]. For this reason, and because the HPDL beam is circular in shape \nwhich results accordingly in the longest interaction occurring in the centre, the highest temperatures \noccur in the centre of the track with the lowest temperatures being experienced on the edge of the \nlaser track. Consequently solidification begins at the edges of the track and develops quickly inwards \nas the laser beam is traversed away. Such observations of directional-solidification are in accord with \nthose of Easterling [26] during welding processes and Bradley et al. [27] during CO2 laser and HPDL \ntreatment of Al2O3 based refractory materials. \n5.3. The effects of wettability characteristics \nAs Fig. 5 shows, it was not possible under any circumstances to deposit pure Sn on any of the glass \nsubstrates. It is asserted that this occurrence can be ascribed entirely to the wettability characteristics \nof the materials. This supposition is borne out somewhat by Fig 7 which shows an optical micrograph \nof a sessile drop of (a) SnO2 and (b) Sn, both at 20\n0C placed on the surface of fused silica glass with \nthe contact angle superimposed. As one can see from Fig. 7, a considerable difference in the observed \ncontact angle between both the SnO2 and the Sn and the fused silica glass. Moreover, as is evident \nfrom Fig. 7(a), the contact angle formed between the Sn and the fused silica glass is in excess of 900, \ntherefore precluding the possibility of wetting and adhesion occurring [18, 19, 25]. \nThe particular nature of the wetting characteristics of metal oxides with silicate surfaces is very well \ndocumented [10]. The adhesion between glasses and oxides is strong primarily because the two \nmaterials are ionic in structure[10]. Nonetheless, the O2 content of a material\u2019s surface is most \ncertainly an influential factor effecting the wetting performance of the material [28, 29]. It is perhaps \nnot surprising then that wetting of either glass could not be achieved with the pure Sn since its O2 \ncontent is naturally considerably less than that of SnO2. Moreover, it is reasonable to conclude that, \nwhereas the O2 content of the pure Sn is so low that it precludes the material from wetting the \nselected glasses, the O2 content of the SnO2 is sufficiently high for the material to wet and bond to the \nglasses. Additionally, it is important to consider the relative intregrities of the glasses during HPDL \ndeposition. As Fig. 3(b) revealed, the integrity of the soda-lime-silica glass surface could not be kept \nentirely because of the generated thermal gradients being beyond the glasses strength limits. \nConsequently cracking occurred which undermined the glass. This constraint for the use of soda-\nlime-silica glass has being noticed before by Vispute et al. [30]. \n 5.4. Bonding characteristics \nFrom Fig. 4 it is clear that the bonding mechanisms between the SnO2 and the two glasses are very \ndifferent. From Fig. 3(b) the SnO2 layer exhibits a microstructure characteristic of a mechanical bond. \nAs is evident from Fig. 4(b), the mechanical bond generated between the SnO2 and the soda-lime-\nsilica glass is as one would expect insofar as the microstructures of the of the two materials appear to \nbe interlocking. In this instance it would seem that during the bonding process, the liquid SnO2 \nflowed with varying degrees of ease into small cavities and asperities present on the surface of the \nsoda-lime-silica glass. Indeed, such bonds are typical for most oxides on soda-lime-silica glass \nsubstrates [10, 30]. In Fig. 4(a), however, the presence of an interface region between the SnO2 and \nthe silica glass substrate is clearly visible, indicating the presence of some form of chemical bond. \nThe results of an XRD analysis of the interface region and the deposited SnO2 layer are shown in Fig. \n8. The lower plot shows the results obtained from an analysis within the SnO2 layer deposited on \nfused silica glass, whilst the upper plot shows the results of an analysis of the interface region \ngenerated between the deposited SnO2 layer and the fused silica glass. As one can see from the lower \nplot, the deposited SnO2 layer, as is to be expected, contains large amounts of Sn and much smaller \namounts of Sn3O2. From the lower plot, on the other hand, it can be seen that the generated interface \nlayer is again comprised mainly of Sn, but is also rich in Sn3O4. It was therefore possible to deduce \nthat the only difference in the interface layer from the deposited SnO2 layer was the of Sn3O4. It is \nsurmised that this Sn3O4 is oxygen enriched SnO2 resulting from oxide transformation or oxide \nbridging between the SnO2 layer and the fused silica glass. \n6. Conclusions \nThe deposition of SnO2 using a 120 W high power diode laser (HPDL) on both fused silica and soda-\nlime-silica glass has been successfully demonstrated. Deposition on both glass substrates was carried \nout with laser power densities of 650-1600 W cm-2 and at rates of 420-1550 mm min-1. The maximum \ntheoretical coverage rate that it may be possible to achieve using the HPDL was calculated as being \n3.72 m2 h-1. In contrast, it proved impossible to deposit pure Sn on either glass substrate, with HPDL \ninteraction resulting in the \u2018balling\u2019 of the Sn on the surfaces of the glass. It is asserted that this \noccurrence is due entirely to differences in the wetting characteristics of the materials, in particular, \nthe differences in the O2 content of the Sn and the SnO2. It is believed that the O2 content of the pure \n Sn is so low that it precludes the material from wetting the selected glasses, whilst the O2 content of \nthe SnO2 is sufficiently high for the material to wet and bond to the glasses. \nEvidence of solidified microstructures was observed, with the microstructures differing considerably \nacross the same deposited track. In the centre of the track the microstructure displaying a semi-\nordered dendritic structure, whilst on the edge of the track an elongated cell structure was seen. The \nobserved differences in microstructure within the same track can be attributed to the fact that at the \nedge of the melt pool the solidification rate, R, is low while the thermal gradient, G, is at its steepest, \ntherefore G\/R is high along the edge of the laser melt track. Towards the centre of the melt zone the \nsolidification rate is increased while the thermal gradient is reduced. Consequently G\/R rapidly falls \noff as solidification proceeds towards the centre of the melt zone. \nThe bonding mechanisms between the SnO2 and the two glasses were found to be very different. \nAdhesion of the SnO2 with the soda-lime-silica glass was found to be due to mechanical bonding. The \nadhesion of the SnO2 with the fused silica, on the hand, was seen to the result of a chemical bond \narising from an interface region between the SnO2 and the fused silica glass substrate. An XRD \nanalysis of the interface region revealed it to be comprised of mainly Si and rich with Sn3O4. \n References \n1. Koinkar, V.N., Ogale, S.B., (1991), Thin Solid Films, 206 259. \n2.
