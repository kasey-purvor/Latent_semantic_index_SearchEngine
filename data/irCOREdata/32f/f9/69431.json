INTRODUCTION\nIN ANY TRAVELING-wave tube (TWT), the impedance ofa coupler should have a good match with the interaction\ncircuit for maximum power transfer and minimum reflection\nfrom both input and output ends. Analytical methods can be\nused for quick prediction of the coupler impedance, but they\nare generally limited to simple and specific slow-wave circuits\n[1], [2] where equivalent transmission line theory [3] can be\nused in calculating the circuit impedance. If, however, the\nshapes of dielectric support rods and metal vanes become\ncomplex, which is quite common, the analytical methods fail to\nachieve sufficient accuracy. Therefore, a 3-D electromagnetic\ncode based on numerical methods should be used to determine\nthe impedance of the slow-wave circuit [4] to match with the\nassembly of the coaxial coupler and the coaxial or waveguide\noutput. In previous attempts, integrated models of the coupler\nand the interaction circuit were simulated in HFSS to compute\nthe return loss of the combined assembly [5], [6]. However, in\nall these cases, the computational time required for each sim-\nulation is very long, making the optimization task very costly.\nSometimes, it may not even be possible to find a near-optimum\nsolution within the stipulated time. Moreover, an integrated\nassembly of slow-wave structure, coupler, and waveguide or\nThreaded Neill-Concelman (TNC) connector is often difficult\nto model with reasonable accuracy because of the large number\nof mesh points needed. To overcome these limitations, the \u201csplit\nmodel\u201d method, which is proposed here for the optimization of\ncouplers, is several times faster than the conventional approach\nManuscript received February 21, 2007; revised April 18, 2007.

CONVENTIONAL OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUE\nTo demonstrate the conventional optimization technique and\nits limitations, an integrated model of the slow-wave circuit and\ncoupler of a 6\u201318-GHz TWT, as shown in Fig. 1, was simulated\n[7] using Microwave Studio. The model consists of several\nturns of helix with finite tape thickness, dielectric support rods,\nT-shaped metallic vanes, body tube, coaxial transition, and\nceramic window assembly. The dielectric properties of the ma-\nterials were defined to ensure an accurate computation of phase\nvelocity of the wave and of the impedance of the total assembly.\nPerfect conducting boundary conditions were applied at the\naxial truncation points of the body tube [8]. Both input and out-\nput couplers were terminated with waveguide ports to simulate\ninfinitely long waveguides at the boundaries of the calculation\ndomain. Once the steady state was reached, S11 was calculated\nfrom the amplitude and the phase of the signals at the ports.\nTo optimize the performance of the coupler, the model was\nsimulated several times with different dimensions, as shown in\n1Supplied by Computer Simulation Technologies.\n0018-9383\/$25.00 \u00a9 2007 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Typical coaxial coupler with out_l as the length of the transition\nsection connected to the helix.\nFig. 3. Comparison between the simulated and experimental VSWR of the\ninput coupler of a 6\u201318-GHz TWT.\nFig. 2. The optimized voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) is\ncompared with the cold test results in Fig. 3, which shows ex-\ncellent agreement. The similarity of the experimental results of\nthe three samples of the tube shows that the tolerances set in the\ndesign were maintained during the fabrication of each tube.\nFor this computational model, the simulation time for each\niteration was nearly 30 min on a PC with a 2.8-GHz processor\nand 2-GB RAM. Therefore, the total computation time for\noptimization and sensitivity analysis to finalize the design and\ntolerances of a coupler is enormous as it involves hundreds of\niterations. It is shown later in this paper that the performance\nof some optimized couplers can still be improved significantly\nwithin a short time by using the split model method.\nIII. PROPOSED TECHNIQUE\nIt was observed that nearly 90% of the time taken for each\nsimulation was due to the inclusion of the slow-wave circuit\nin the model. However, it remains unchanged throughout the\noptimization process. Moreover, because a large number of\nmesh points are required to model the complex shape of the\nhelix, the available mesh points are inadequate to model the\ncoupler with reasonable accuracy as the total number of mesh\nnodes is limited by the computer hardware. The split model\nprocedure overcomes these limitations by using a combination\nof numerical and analytical procedures.\nFig. 4. Split models of helix and coupler assemblies for uniform coaxial\ntransition section.\nA. Implementation\nIf the slow-wave circuit is removed from the integrated\nmodel during repetitive computations, then the simulation time\nis reduced drastically while all the mesh nodes become avail-\nable to model the coupler assembly. Therefore, we replaced\nthe slow-wave circuit with its equivalent reflection coefficient\nduring optimization.\nThe technique is illustrated in the following steps.\n1) The integrated model (see Fig. 1) is split into two at the\ntransition section of the coupler (see Fig. 2) to create\nthe helix and the coupler assembly models, as shown in\nFig. 4. The helix assembly consists of the slow-wave cir-\ncuit and an output coaxial pin of arbitrary length out_l1,\nwhereas the coupler assembly consists of the rest of the\nintegrated model but with an arbitrary length of the final\nsection equal to out_l2. These two lengths remain the\nsame throughout the optimization process. It is necessary\nto keep these lengths short so that, together, they are less\nthan or equal to the total length of the transition section\nin the final assembly.\n2) A number of helix assembly models are created and\nsimulated with different impedances at the output pin. For\nexample, 20 helix models can be created and simulated\nwith output pin impedances 50, 55, 60 \u2126, . . ., etc. The\namplitude \u03c11 and the phase \u03b81 of S11 (see Fig. 4) corre-\nsponding to each impedance value are stored for a number\nof frequencies (about 100) in the operating band of the\nTWT. An overnight simulation in batch mode creates a\ndata bank, and there is no need for further simulation of\nthese models if the slow-wave circuit remains unchanged.\n3) In a similar way, the same number of coupler assembly\nmodels is created by making the impedance of its final\nsection the same as the output pin of the helix assembly.\nThus, 20 pairs of helix and coupler assembly models\nare created where each pair corresponds to a specific\nimpedance. The simulated values of the amplitude \u03c12 and\nthe phase \u03b82 of S22 (see Fig. 4) are combined analytically\nwith the S11 of the corresponding helix assembly for\nthe same frequencies as in step 2 to calculate the overall\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Equivalent microwave circuit showing the reflection coefficient.\nreturn loss. Details of the analytical method used for this\npurpose are given later in this section.\n4) The performance of any pair may be optimized through\na number of trials by changing the different dimensions\nof the coupler assembly, other than the final section, and\nby combining the simulated results analytically with the\ncorresponding helix assembly. The process is repeated\nfor other pairs, and the best match among the 20 pairs is\ntaken as the optimum design. Further optimization can be\ncarried out by repeating Steps 2, 3, and 4 for impedances\naround the best match.\nThe new technique has many advantages over the conven-\ntional procedure. Because the integrated model is split into\ntwo individual models, all the mesh nodes become available\nto model each of them with better accuracy. This also makes\nit possible to model simultaneously a longer slow-wave circuit\nand a complex coupler shape with TNC or waveguide output.\nIt takes less than 2 min to simulate the coupler assembly with\nan SMA or TNC connector and 1 min to import the simulated\nresults and combine them analytically. This is 10% of the time\ntaken for the simulation of the integrated model. Therefore, the\noptimization can be carried out within a much shorter time.\nB. Combining S-Parameters (Uniform Coaxial)\nAn equivalent microwave circuit of the integrated assem-\nbly is shown in Fig. 5 where \u03931 and \u03932 are the reflection\ncoefficients of the helix (S11) and coupler (S22) assemblies,\nrespectively, calculated as\n\u03931 = \u03c11ej\u03b81 (1)\n\u03932 = \u03c12ej(\u03c0\u2212\u03b82) (2)\nwhere \u03c11, \u03b81, \u03c12, and \u03b82 are all functions of frequency. S22\nfor the coupler assembly is in the opposite direction to S11 for\nthe helix assembly (see Fig. 4), whereas they are in the same\ndirection in the equivalent model. Therefore, the equivalent\nphase of S22 is taken as (\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b82) in the circuit instead of \u03b82.\nA uniform coaxial line of the same impedance as the helix\noutput pin with length Lgap is introduced between the helix\nand coupler assemblies (see Fig. 4) to optimize the length of\nthe transition section, as both out_l1 and out_l2 remain fixed\nthroughout the computation. In the optimized design, the length\nof the transition section of the coupler out_l is equal to the total\nlength of these three. The length Lgap can have any positive\nvalue, including zero, and its equivalent electrical length at any\nfrequency f is\n\u03b8 = 2\u03c0fLgap\/c (3)\nwhere c is the velocity of light in vacuum. The overall reflection\ncoefficient of the combined assembly is calculated from the\ntheory of multiple reflections [9] as\n\u0393 =\n\u03932 + \u03931e\u2212j2\u03b8\n1 + \u03931\u03932e\u2212j2\u03b8\n(4)\nwhere \u03931 and \u03932 are both complex and defined by (1) and\n(2), respectively. After simplification of this equation, \u0393 is\nexpressed in the form of real and imaginary parts from which its\namplitude is calculated (see the Appendix). The overall VSWR\nover the frequency band is calculated using\nVSWR = 1 + |\u0393|\n1 \u2212 |\u0393| . (5)\nC. Combining S-Parameters (Tapered Coaxial)\nTo create two models, the tapered transition section, like\nuniform coaxial line, is divided into two, as shown in Fig. 6.\nA coaxial section of small length is added at the end of the\ntapered line to simulate a waveguide port at the truncation point.\nTo combine the S-parameters, the phase of the signals must be\ncalculated at points H2 and C2, whereas the simulated values\n\u03b81H and \u03b82C are obtained at points H1 and C1 for the helix and\ncoupler assemblies, respectively. As the amplitude of the signal\nremains unchanged between points on a uniform coaxial line, it\nis only necessary to recalculate the phase as\n\u03b81 = \u03b81H + 4\u03c0fTLH\/c (6)\n\u03b82 = \u03b82C + 4\u03c0fTLC\/c (7)\nwhere TLH and TLC are the lengths of small coaxial sections\nadded to the helix and coupler assemblies, respectively. The\nVSWR of the combined assembly is now calculated using\n(1)\u2013(5) and setting Lgap = 0.\nD. Computer Code\nA computer code \u201cCOUPLED\u201d implementing the analytical\nmethod was developed in C and runs in DOS.

Both couplers were fitted\nwith SMA connectors and used in a 4.5\u201310-GHz TWT. The\ncoupler with a uniform transition section was first optimized\nusing the split model technique and, later, was simulated using\nthe conventional method. Good agreement between the two\nmethods is shown in the VSWR versus frequency plot in Fig. 7.\nIt is also observed from the plot that the coupler is optimized\nto have its best performance at the higher end of the frequency\nband, as the output power is lower in this region.\nAgain, the simulated results of a coupler with a tapered\ntransition section, shown in Fig. 8, match each other closely\nthroughout the band of operation of the TWT. Similar agree-\nments were observed by changing the different dimensions of\nboth coupler geometries [10]. This establishes the consistency\nof the proposed method.\nFig. 8. Comparison between the simulated VSWR of the coupler with tapered\ncoaxial transition section used in a 4.5\u201310-GHz TWT.\nIV. VALIDATION AND OPTIMIZATION\nTo demonstrate the capability of the proposed method, mod-\nels of three different coupler geometries with either a coax-\nial connector or waveguide as output were validated by cold\ntest data and optimized. All of these couplers were originally\noptimized using either the conventional technique or through\nrepetitive experimental evaluation. Optimized geometries were\ntaken as the starting point for further optimization using the\nproposed method. None of the simulations included the effect\nof loss due to the coating on the rods.\nThe input coupler of a 6\u201318-GHz TWT with an SMA\nconnector was taken as the first geometry for modeling. The\nsimulated result is compared with the cold test data in Fig. 9.\nExcellent agreement, validating the model, is achieved over the\nentire frequency band. A comparison between the original and\nthe optimized performances in the plot reveals that, while the\nconventional technique was able to achieve a VSWR better\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Comparison between the simulated and experimental VSWR of the\ncouplers used in a 4.5\u201318-GHz TWT.\nthan 2.15, further optimization using the split model method\nimproved this value to 1.65 with a significant improvement\nnear both edges of the frequency band. It was not possible to\ncontinue the optimization using the standard technique due to\ntime constraints.\nThe second geometry is a coupler with a TNC connector,\nused as both the input and output of a 4.5\u201318-GHz TWT. An\nintegrated model of the slow-wave circuit, the coupler with\ntapered transition section, and connector could not be created\nwith reasonable accuracy due to its size. Simulated results for\nboth the original and optimized geometries, which are obtained\nusing the split model method, are compared with the cold test\ndata in Fig. 10. The close match between experimental and\nsimulated results for the original geometry validates the model.\nIt is also observed that the original VSWR is better than 1.9\nwith the worst values around 8.5-GHz. Optimization was able\nto improve this significantly in the middle of the band with a\nlittle deterioration at the lower end of the band.\nThe third coupler uses a waveguide as the output of the\n6\u201318-GHz TWT. Like the previous case, the integrated geom-\nFig. 11. Comparison between the simulated and experimental VSWR of the\noutput couplers used in a 6\u201318-GHz TWT.\netry could not be modeled using the conventional technique\nbecause it required too many mesh nodes. The simulated\nVSWR plotted in Fig. 11 closely resembles the three sets of\ncold test data, although there is a slight difference. In practice,\nthe waveguide has a number of screws to fine-tune the overall\nperformance according to the requirement of the output power,\ne.g., a lower VSWR may be desirable at the higher frequencies\nwith a compromise elsewhere in the band. The positions of the\nscrews inside the waveguide at the tuned condition vary from\none tube to another and were not known. Hence, the tuning\nscrews were not included in the model, which may be the reason\nfor slight difference in the results. The optimized VSWR of\nthe coupler is better than 1.5, with a significant improvement\nthroughout most of the band.\nV. CONCLUSION\nA new method for modeling and optimizing coaxial couplers\nhas been described and validated by experimental results. It was\nshown that this method could be used to reduce the time for one\ndesign iteration by 90% in comparison with the conventional\nprocedure. Using this technique, significant improvements were\nachieved in the performance of couplers, which had originally\nbeen optimized by either the conventional procedure or by\nrepetitive experimentation. The advantages of the technique\nwere demonstrated by optimizing the couplers with TNC and\nwaveguide outputs, both of which could not be modeled with\nreasonable accuracy using the conventional method because of\nthe limitation in the number of mesh nodes handled by the\ncomputer hardware. Thus, the proposed method can be used\nas a fast and accurate way of modeling and optimizing large\ngeometries. Future work will include the effect of loss due to\nthe coating on the rods, which may improve the match.\nAPPENDIX\nThe reflection coefficient parameters in (1) and (2) can be\nexpressed as\n\u03931 =P + jQ (A1)\n\u03932 =R+ jS (A2)\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.
