The paper is founded on the\nwork of Sharif (1986, 1991, 2000), who extended the idea as an explanation\nof the labour market behaviour of the working poor. Our perspective is from\nthe micro level, that is, the individual selling his or her labour, and our concern\nis to argue that this abnormal supply curve is relevant to tourism development\nand quality. Tourism is often associated with the creation of new jobs. However,\nthe creation of new jobs alone does not lead automatically to the creation of\nwealth for the indigenous population because new jobs may not provide an\nacceptable standard of living, which in turn leads to an abnormal extension of\neffort in terms of hours worked. Our view of tourism relieving poverty is not\nfrom the perspective of economic models but from the micro level of unskilled\nlabour, a category which is often ill-defined and under-analysed by official\nstatistics. The returns to unskilled workers are less than those to other tourism-\nrelated occupations such as skilled workers or entrepreneurs, even when the\nindustry is expanding (Blake et al, 2008). Our rationale for this assertion is\nbased on the nature of the unskilled occupations and the labour market\ndynamics they promote.\nThe basic proposition is that the supply curve can slope downwards,\nindicating that people extend supply as the rate of pay declines. The argument\nTOURISM ECONOMICS298\nis that this curve does not replace the conventional upwards-sloping form but\ncan, in certain circumstances, be the initial stage of the curve. This does not\nmean that it is necessarily of short duration. At the centre of Sharif\u2019s argument\nis a constellation of three assumptions. Firstly, that the lowest point on the\nsupply curve that functions to attract labour into the market may not accord\nwith any acceptable level of subsistence. Secondly, the idea that acceptance of\na level of subsistence is self-defined and therefore open to reinterpretations\ndriven by the motivational dispositions of the individual. Thirdly, that market\ncircumstances can exist whereby labour is so abundant that it deters\ntechnological substitution and has the effect of simultaneously deflating levels\nof pay and providing such turbulence in the market to convince the sellers of\nlabour that there are open-ended opportunities for work.\nSharif distinguished the working poor from non-poor workers in behavioural\nterms through the notion of \u2018distress selling\u2019 of labour. The term \u2018distress\u2019 is\nused here to represent the idea that, for the poor, there is no realistic leisure\noption; even for women with children. He argues against the classical economic\nargument that failure to enter the market is due to \u2018irrational limited\naspiration\u2019. That the poor have an option for leisure is, for Sharif, only realistic\nin cases of strong welfare societies and rarely appears in development situations.\nWe argue that the circumstances of tourism, and particularly tourism\ndevelopment, may fit the notion of an abundant labour market which promotes\nthe conditions of distress selling. It might not be easy for the image of tourism\nto accept that some of its workers are \u2018working poor\u2019 but, given that the average\nearnings are always well below national averages, it is a realistic view that they\nare (Riley et al, 2002).\nThe downward-sloping supply curve\nSharif (1991, 2000) terms the downward slope of the curve the \u2018forwards-falling\u2019\ncurve and contrasts it with the normal curve using a set of premises that\nsimultaneously describe a constellation of market conditions. The premises are:\n(1) That the bottom point of any normal supply curve is a line identifying the\nwage rate that is supposed to draw people into the market. This wage rate,\nhowever, does not automatically provide a subsistence wage. It cannot be\nregarded as a reserve wage guaranteeing an acceptable standard of living.\n(2) That there is a difference between surplus labour and abundance whereby,\nwith surplus labour, the total amount of work in the economy is shared\nand differentiated by rules that mean in practice that at the lower end there\nis a lot of part-time work. Abundance, by contrast, implies labour is\nabundant relative to other means of production; so plentiful that it deters\ntechnological substitution. In these conditions, the wage rate can be driven\ndown by the market to below subsistence level.\n(3) That what constitutes subsistence level and standard of living is determined\nsubjectively; subsistence is self-defined (Sharif, 1986). It follows, therefore,\nthat this condition is not confined to the working poor.\nSharif goes on to argue that the conditions specified in (1) and (2) produce\n\u2018distress\u2019 selling of labour. And, it follows logically from (3) that this can occur\n299Tourism employment and poverty\nFigure 1. Adapted from Sharif\u2019s forwards-falling curve (Sharif, 2000, p 427).\nat any level of pay, as long as it does not satisfy the self-defined subsistence\nor acceptable standard of living. The idea of a downward-sloping curve does\nnot challenge the normal supply curve for labour (upward-sloping then\nbackwards-bending) \u2013 which has at its lowest point on the curve the amount\nof pay capable of drawing the individual into, say, a tourism job performed at\nthe lowest level of effort. It does, however, suggest the possibility of\nreinterpreting motives at the very low point of the normal curve. The\nassumption of this curve is that the low point represents some kind of\nsubsistence level wage or reservation wage that is acceptable. There is, in fact,\nno guarantee that this point at which people take up work actually provides an acceptable\nstandard of living. Sharif argues that when it does not, consideration should be\ngiven to a different supply curve that shows a negative relationship between\nwage rates and the amount of labour supplied \u2013 more is supplied for less pay.\nIn this conception, the curve falls forward in a gentle downward slope.\nFigure 1 describes the forwards-falling curve based on the existence of the\nconditions (1), (2) and (3) described above. In the figure, M represents the\nlowest possible survival rate at W2. The curve falls forward towards M as people\nincrease effort to gain as much as is possible in conditions where management\ncan take advantage of abundance in supply. NS represents the lower end of a\nnormal supply curve; the assumption of this figure is that N does not represent\nan adequate standard of living. If N did represent an acceptable standard of\nliving, then the distress selling of labour is confined to the area under the curve\nN M. It can be argued that the same phenomenon could be represented simply\nby the normal curve being moved to the right, but that simply creates the same\nissue elsewhere if the end point of the curve does not satisfy subsistence.\nHowever, by arguing that the level of subsistence is self-defined, he is\nmaking it harder to delineate the behaviours represented by the two curves.\nK S\nLower end of\nnormal curve\nM\nL1                                                    L2   \nLabour supply\nN\nW2\nW1\nWage\nrate\nTOURISM ECONOMICS300\nOne interpretation of his analysis suggests that the downward curve represents\nthose striving to achieve an acceptable subsistence level, never mind an\nacceptable standard of living (for themselves or their family). Consequently, it\nis the pursuit of the latter that makes the curve slope upwards in the normal\nway. However, in terms of motives, the change, for the individual, from a goal\nof subsistence to one of an acceptable standard of living would be seen as a\nsingle pursuit judged at evaluative stages. Certainly, the two curves are seen\nas part of the same supply drive but, for the individual, the point at which\nthe curve slopes upward is a not a predictable certainty in the short run. A\nprominent theme within the human resource management literature is a\nconcern for work\u2013life balance, with its implication of pressure in the modern\nworking environment for individuals to be overcommitted to work and to\nextend supply in a way which is detrimental to other aspects of life (Campbell,\n2002). This concern assumes that employees have a degree of choice about their\nhours at work and can resist the \u2018long hours culture\u2019 if they choose. The\narguments on the downward supply curve assume that there is not realistic\nchoice other than to extend hours of work. What Campbell is describing is,\nin fact, a downward-sloping curve.\nThe tourism labour market context\nHow far the tourism secondary labour market conforms to Sharif\u2019s notion of\nabundance is a matter for research, but the evidence on the character of such\nmarkets, though indirect and circumstantial, points consistently in the same\ndirection. Firstly, there is evidence that the secondary market for tourism\noccupation conforms to the unstable characteristics described by Doeringer and\nPiore (1982), namely high velocity interfirm labour turnover by uncommitted\nworkers encouraged by management adopting weak internal labour markets.\nSecondly, as a consequence of the easy accessibility of skills, the labour is always\nin surplus supply (Riley, 1991). Empirical evidence shows that tourism is a\nrelatively easy industry to access. The low skill level, multiple job types and\na turbulent labour market are seen as the principal causes of the market\u2019s\nopenness. This attraction is despite the constant deflationary pressures on pay\nwithin the tourism industry structure (Riley and Szivas, 2003). Indeed, one of\nthe dominant arguments to explain low pay is that the labour market is always\nkept in surplus, if not abundance, by the nature of the work. Recruitment\ndifficulties inevitably are resolved without recourse to increasing pay (Riley,\n1990). Thirdly, that despite the low level of innovation, the labour-intensive\nnature of industry encourages management to use technological change, not\nsimply to lower employment levels but also to substitute lower paid workers\nfor the higher paid. Alpert (1986) showed that the reduction in employment\ncaused by an increase in the minimum wage was offset by technological\nsubstitution, leading to increased employment of more cheaper, lower-skilled\nworkers. This finding is in line with Rosen\u2019s notion that when skills are easy\nto acquire, there is no need for management to buy higher productivity in the\nlabour market (Rosen, 1972).\nTo a large extent, tourism secondary labour markets are deregulated, but\nwhat gives them the capacity to be abundant rather than mere surplus markets\n301Tourism employment and poverty\nis reputational information. Attraction itself is caused by the reputation for\nopen-ended access to all levels of human capital (Szivas and Riley, 1999; Szivas\net al, 2003; Vaugeois and Rollins, 2007). High-velocity labour turnover,\ntogether with the short-term fluctuations in demand, means that there are\nalways vacancies to be filled and, if not, they will be along shortly; there is\nalways opportunity to earn more (Fry, 1979; Segal and Sullivan, 1997; Manning,\n2000). If this dynamic causes an attraction to the market, then this could foster\nan orientation within management not to seek technological substitution\nbecause of the certainty of constant supply. The issue of entrepreneurs ignoring\nprogressive technology in favour of unskilled labour is acknowledged in the\nliterature of economic development (Rosenberg, 1991; Recio and Banyulis,\n2004).\nApplications of the curve\nThere are two cases where this curve may be applicable. In the first case, where\nthe level of pay is the sole income and does not give a subsistence standard\nof living and where the opportunity for a higher pay level is not possible. In\nthese circumstances, workers put in extended hours to get as much as is possible\nfrom what is available, towards M. This would apply just as well to a self-\ndefined subsistence level. Thozhur et al (2007), in their study of low-paid\nworkers (including tourism workers), provide some evidence of this with workers\nusing extended hours (without overtime) double and sometimes treble jobbing.\nIn short, this case is about working very hard to keep up a self-defined\nminimum standard of living.\nIn the second case, the limitation is by either a finite amount of work\navailable, in which case workers compete to get as big a share as possible in\nterms of pay and hours, or where the rewards are distributed by some cultural\njudicial norm that does not recognize comparative effort. In other words, where\neither the total pay is fixed irrespective of who earns, or where regulation occurs\nthat ignores actual worker contribution. For example, there can be conflicts\nwithin internal divisions of an indigenous population sharing a fairly fixed\namount of reward (Van den Berge, 1992). In other words, \u2018distress\u2019 selling is\na two-way valve \u2013 having to work longer to scoop as much as possible from\nthe pool and having to work extended hours for a fixed amount simply to\nmaintain the pool. Similarly, where tourism is based on community activity or\na family firm, then everyone cooperates to give each member a share of the pot\n\u2013 in these circumstances, people give their labour knowing their share is not\noptimal and may not be meeting their personal target earnings. In short, this\ncase is about knowing there is a finite amount and\/or acknowledging that the\nfinite amount should be shared within the group by some means unrelated to\njust effort.\nIn both cases, there is a \u2018distress\u2019 element to the selling of labour. There is\nboth an important condition and an important consequence to this concept of\n\u2018distress\u2019 selling. The condition is that the self-definition of an adequate standard is\ninfluenced by other sources of income, and possibly capital. Often, tourism\nincomes are mixed in with other sources. A full understanding of tourism\nincomes and their relationship to labour supply requires these other sources,\nTOURISM ECONOMICS302\nsuch as agriculture, family and community, to be considered. Indeed, many\ntourism products are built out of capital owned by the poor. The consequence\nis the effect on the quality of tourism products from a workforce that is selling\nits labour in a distress condition: an unresponsive labour force is a drag on\neconomic development (Miracle and Fetter, 1970). The two cases of insufficient\nincome and a finite pot of rewards when taken together with the presence of\nbroader deflationary pressures suggest that, at least theoretically, the response\nof extending labour supply can occur in both a developed and underdeveloped\ntourism situation.\nMigration effects\nThe link between self-defined subsistence and mobility is through the effort\nrewards relationship described through the supply curve. The paper argues that\nthere are three thresholds that, when crossed or exceeded, create the drive to\nmove on to another tourism destination or out of the industry. These are, when\nextended supply does not bring forth an acceptable level of subsistence, when\nthe bonds of community are stretched by a just and traditional distribution\nsystem that neither provides enough work nor enough income and when the\nabsolute value of incomes does not reach an acceptable level. The paper argues\nthat income that is insufficient to reach the bottom level of the normal curve\nleads first to the distress selling of labour, then to the option to be in some\nway mobile. This is seen only as a special case of the general theory relating\npay to mobility. That is, that the attendant motives are attributed, in the\nstructural sense, to economic and knowledge\/skill differentials and, in the\npsychological sense, to individual drives, which can be either of a self-advancing\nor of a deprivation avoidance character. In other words, the perceived\ndifferential, whether it be greater earnings, more knowledge or better life\nchances, can evoke a positive need for self-enhancement or a negative one to\navoid the consequences of being deprived by the differential (Mueller, 1982;\nSzivas and Riley, 1999).\nThe desire to be mobile does, to an extent, require a target. Models of\nmigration suggest productivity differentials cause income differentials, resulting\nin mobility until equilibrium is established (Harris and Todaro, 1970). One of\nthe limitations of such models is that two secondary markets are assumed to\nhave the same dynamics, which we argue is not the case. Dynamic instability\nin a market is attractive because it brings a degree of certainty about employ-\nment opportunities. If mobility and migration are related to the distress selling\nof labour in an industry where access is easy, it is possible to see a syndrome\nin which the very act of mobility undermines its ultimate purpose. Ease of\naccess itself means that tourism is an area of opportunity, added to which it\nis also attractive to many people who are drawn to its lack of routine and its\nair of glamour. These supply-side characteristics, however, bring their own\nproblems, particularly in the area of pay and black market employment (Stalker,\n1994; Riley, 2004).\nWhether at national or regional level, there is always a concern for the effect\nof inward migration of labour on the indigenous population. At the forefront\nof this concern is the displacement of local workers by newcomers, and\n303Tourism employment and poverty\nconsequent unemployment. Given that the motives for recruitment of outsiders\nare normally a perceived shortage of labour, the important effect is not only\non employment levels, but also on the pay levels. The two issues are linked\ninexorably and, unfortunately, the empirical evidence here tells a slightly\nambiguous story. For the skilled indigenous labour, the effects of imported\nskilled labour appear to be beneficial both in terms of extending job\nopportunities and increasing pay. Both presumably caused by the labour\nshortage that motivated the migration in the first place. However, the evidence\nof similar positive effects is somewhat less strong for unskilled workers (Pedace,\n1988). Here, the argument is that, on the one hand, imported skilled labour\nreduces the opportunities for development of unskilled workers but, on the\nother, and more importantly, where unskilled labour is imported to fill a\nshortage, the effect is to deflate existing pay levels. At the moment, the\nevidence for the latter remains only conceptual and circumstantial but is,\nnevertheless, strong. By importing labour, the industry enforces deflationary\npressure on pay, to the extent that incomes may not meet the expectations of\nthe incoming workers. They may increase their standard of living marginally,\nbut still may be forced to extend labour by distress selling.\nDiscussion\nThe basic tenet of this paper is that any debate on the contribution of tourism\nto the wealth of a local population has to recognize that some circumstances\ncan promote the distress selling of labour. These conditions occur when\nmanagement perceive the labour market to be abundant and therefore can drive\nwage rates down, even when the industry is expanding. They can also occur\nwhen cultural norms create a system of distributing work and reward that gives\nonly suboptimal rewards to each worker. One of the intentions of the paper is\nto emphasize that extended hours of work are a consequence of the unskilled\nnature of the majority of tourism occupations, which elicits a response from\nhuman resource management that maintains the conditions for the distress\nselling of labour (Riley and Szivas, 2009). Models of migration underestimate\nthe dynamic characteristic of secondary labour markets and that such markets\ncan be differentiated by the way this is perceived; it can be both a deterrent\nand an attraction to market participation.\nA secondary purpose of the paper is to draw attention to the effects of tourism\non indigenous culture. The impact of tourism on cultural norms needs to be\ncognizant of changes in income distribution within social groups. Traditional\nreward systems tend to be defined culturally by norms rather than by market\ndynamics. Such norm structures can create the condition of finite work and\nreward, which means suboptimal effort and reward. The consequent tension\nbetween a traditional structure and a market-driven distribution system requires\nfurther research. Tourism not only changes wealth, but also traditional\nstructures of distribution.\nThe contribution of this paper is to the debate on if, and how, tourism affects\nthe wealth of its labour force. We suggest that official statistics and skill\ncategories hide the different dynamics of secondary labour markets and argue\nthat understanding relative pay, mobility and poverty relief needs to\nTOURISM ECONOMICS304\nacknowledge that conditions can occur when the rewards to unskilled labour\nin terms of earnings are dependent on a willingness to extend labour supply,\neven when pay levels are declining.\nReferences\nAlpert, W.T.
