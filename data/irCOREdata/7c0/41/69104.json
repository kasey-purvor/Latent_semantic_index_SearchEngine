In this paper, I will explore key features\nand factors that need to be considered by managers and\npractitioners if they are to implement mobile learning\ntechnology into schools successfully. Some of these features\nand factors lie outside the immediate realms of teacher\nclassroom practice, but do need to be accommodated. I will\npropose a systemic implementation framework, modified\nfrom an existing framework, to model these features and\nfactors. The constructs at the heart of this framework take\nup a salient point made by Roschelle [1], who noted that\ncertain features of mobile devices would almost certainly be\nfundamentally important in terms of supporting learning,\nbut that taking an oversimplistic view of the roles and social\npractices involved could well diminish outcomes.\nTo identify a framework to appropriately describe and\nmodel successful implementation of mobile learning tech-\nnologies, I will consider evidence from a number of relevant\nareas of study. Initially, I will summarize what a number of\npublished studies and reports say about implementation\nand the aspects of learning activities that are being\nsupported. It will be clear that these learning activities\ncould involve stakeholders beyond the immediate bound-\naries of the classroom, but at the same time, offer important\nlearning opportunities.\nA range of research literatures on the development of\nlearning highlights reasons why these activities are\nfundamentally important to pupils\u2019 education and learning\ndevelopment, and that they rely upon certain operational\nfeatures of mobile learning technologies. I will select\nexamples of such learning activities and show that for\nimplementation of these activities, practitioners and man-\nagers need to adopt a systemic approach involving\nimportant cultural and political elements from the outset.\nI will review a number of models describing the\nadoption and implementation of technologies (including\nmobile learning technologies) into schools to consider a\nframework that can adequately describe features and\nfactors involved in the successful integration into practice\nof these forms of learning activities. A selected framework\nwill need to accommodate technologies providing access\nand opportunities for learning in settings inside as well as\noutside school, with mobility offering learning interactions\nat times and in places selected by the learner or others\ninvolved in learning support.\nI will use evidence from two specific case studies\nexploring school, home, informal, and formal uses of mobile\nhandheld technologies by pupils in school and community\nlocalities to show how the proposed implementation frame-\nwork describes and explains acceptance and adoption of\nmobile learning practices in terms of learning outcomes,\nimpacts, and involvement with stakeholders.\nIn arguing that the introduction of mobile technologies\ninto schools needs to be considered fundamentally from a\nchange and systemic implementation perspective rather\nthan from a more simplistic phased implementation\nperspective, I will identify, in summary, the factors\naffecting implementation for each stakeholder.\n2 MOBILE TECHNOLOGIES AND LEARNING\nEvidence, both from a range of published studies (Perry [2],\nNaismith et al. [3], Attewell [4], McFarlane et al. [5], Lai\net al. [6]) and from findings of studies carried out by the\n68 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES, VOL. 3, NO. 1, JANUARY-MARCH 2010\n.

Restrictions apply. \nauthor (reported later in this paper as case studies),\nindicates that certain learner activities are being supported\neffectively and positively through features of mobile\ntechnologies. Mobility, coupled with ease of software access\nand integration of media and applications, allows pupils to\nwork more continuously across home and school settings,\nallows activities to be initiated outside the school, or\npractice on exercises to be undertaken when or where\ndesired (vocabulary exercises on a Saturday afternoon in a\ncar, for example). From a cognitive learning perspective, it\nis clear that current mobile technologies grasp the attention\nof many pupils; pupils engage in acquisition of knowledge\nthrough a range of sensory (visual, auditory, kinesthetic)\nroutes (reported by Perry [2], Naismith et al. [3], Attewell\n[4], and McFarlane et al. [5]). Some researchers have\nreported impacts on learning in specific cognitive areas,\nenhancing the manipulation of ideas and knowledge, rather\nthan supporting the earlier engagement and acquisition\nstages of cognition. Lai et al. [6], for example, looking at\nlearning outcomes in 2 fifth-grade classes in an elementary\nschool found improvements in knowledge creation during\nexperiential learning. Evidence across the studies of Perry\n[2], Attewell [4], and McFarlane et al. [5] shows that pupils\ncan retain certain knowledge and skills when using mobile\ntechnology facilities, they are able to rehearse knowledge,\nand to recall it through a range of routes (supported, it\nappears, through high personal levels of ownership and\nmodes of use). What is clear from these outcomes is that the\nform of learning activity and the provision of ownership\nmake a difference to outcome. This being the case,\nimplementation frameworks need to focus centrally on\nappropriate learning activities; there is an important role in\nschools for both the teacher and manager to know about\nlearning activities that will support the learner, allow for\nopportunities to extend and engage learning outside the\nclassroom as well as inside the classroom, and enable the\nlearner to gain as full an ownership of the mobile\ntechnology for learning as possible.\nWhile teachers supporting learners with mobile technol-\nogies do so in different ways, some teachers conceive or\nprovide activities that focus on engagement, acquisition,\nand rehearsal of knowledge or ideas (such as a resource to\ncheck spellings using audio as well as text facilities [7]).\nOthers focus on internal higher order cognitive aspects such\nas analysis or synthesis or evaluation of ideas (identifying\nwhat a video of a science experiment tells you when you see\na set of chemical reactions, for example). Yet others focus on\nthe externalization of ideas (bringing together images and\nnotes from a visit to a castle to create a news story report, for\nexample). Teachers choose learning activities to match the\nneeds and starting positions of their learners, as well as\nmeeting curriculum needs. Using research evidence about\nlearning and its development, implementation of learning\nactivities using mobile technologies should certainly con-\nsider whether there are opportunities for learners to gain\nfrom aspects provided that are critical to effective learning.\nThese critical aspects include metacognitive elements of\nlearning, such as the reflective characteristics and thinking\nstrategies described by Presseisen [8] or Moseley et al. [9],\nand megacognitive aspects of learning, such as the\nimportance of conversation, discussion, and talk described\nby Pask [10], or the importance of social contexts in\ndeveloping cognition described by Vygotsky [11], or the\nimportance of \u201cbig pictures,\u201d or the transfer of learning\ndescribed by Bransford et al. [12]. To offer activities that\nsupport these critical features of learning, teachers might\nselect to use mobile technologies in certain ways. Rather\nthan to just undertake communication itself, learning\nactivities selected might include those concerned with data\ncapture, exchange and sharing, or those sharing imagery,\nideas, and thoughts to provoke discussion (\u201coffline\u201d as well\nas \u201conline,\u201d exemplified in the practice described in a case\nstudy published by Steljes, for example, [13]).\n3 USEFUL LEARNING ACTIVITIES\nFrom a teacher practitioner viewpoint, selected activities\ncan benefit from mobile technology features, and at the\nsame time, support a range of learning elements. \u201cReview\nand reflect,\u201d where pupils capture audio, imagery, and\nvideo during lessons, used in plenary sessions to reflect on\nwhat has been covered, the key elements learned, how these\nfit into wider pictures, and how ideas might be taken\nfurther outside the classroom, can support higher cognitive\nand metacognitive levels of learning. \u201cThink forward,\u201d\nwhere pupils access future topics via the Internet and\ncapture relevant thoughts or ideas to contribute to these in\nclass or through online discussions, can support aspects of\nthe transfer of learning. \u201cListen to my explanations,\u201d where\npupils record audio to complete homework assignments\nand teachers mark these verbal explanations, can support\nactive engagement and reflection. \u201cSnap and show,\u201d where\npupils capture imagery that is downloaded, for wider pupil\ndiscussion, made accessible to parents so that they can see\nand discuss events that have happened in school, can\nsupport enhanced participation. \u201cThis is what I\u2019ve done and\nhow I\u2019ve done it,\u201d where pupils create presentations of how\nthey have used mobile technologies to tackle particular\nactivities, these are recorded and made accessible on\nappropriate Websites for teachers and parents to see, can\nsupport enhanced social interactions. \u201cTell me how I could\nimprove this,\u201d where pupils share their work in multimedia\nformats with peers, mentors, teachers, or trusted adults in\norder to seek evaluative feedback, assessments of their\nwork, and ideas for improvement on which they can act,\ncan support the development of supportive social networks.\nIt can be argued that it is these forms of activity that need to\nbe developed and exploited more, if mobile technologies\nare to feature strongly in providing support for learning in\nways that other technologies cannot provide. Mobile\ntechnologies allow ideas or examples to be captured at a\npoint in time when and in a place where these are generated\nor observed, they allow conversation and discussion at\ntimes when and in places where points of interest arise, and\nthey allow sharing of captured or saved work items in\nplaces where people with more information or other\nperspectives are found.\nMobile learning technologies support these forms of\nactivities in a range of ways. They offer immediacy of \u201csnap\nand show\u201d actions, and access to resources where and when\nrequired (when a learner is in a gallery or garden, for\nPASSEY: MOBILE LEARNING IN SCHOOL CONTEXTS: CAN TEACHERS ALONE MAKE IT HAPPEN? 69\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library. Downloaded on June 08,2010 at 10:32:27 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. \nexample). Records go wherever the learner is, to share these\nwhere and when they choose, in locations that can be\nremote from desktop or fixed equipment. They offer ease\nand relative unobtrusiveness of use in classrooms, as well\nas integration of records with other software facilities,\nproviding a width of media to allow changes to be made at\na point of discussion. They offer accessibility through other\ndevices for wider presentation purposes inside and outside\na classroom. From across this list, it is clear that learning\nactivities focusing on critical aspects of learning, involving\nconversational, social, and societal aspects can be selected\nby teachers and used in practice. However, although it is\nlikely to be within this realm that mobile technologies could\nhave the widest and most profound impacts, it is also clear\nthat while teachers can set up these activities, learners\ndepend on the willingness and acceptance of other\nstakeholders to undertake them in their entirety. This being\nthe case, implementation models or frameworks need to\nconsider not only who these other stakeholders might be,\nand what their roles are or might be, but also how these\nother stakeholders will be involved in engaging with and\nsupporting these forms of learning activities (and these\nforms will be identified within the case studies described in\nSections 5 and 6). If these types of learning activities are to\nbe undertaken effectively, involving stakeholders outside\nthe school as well as inside the school, then implementation\nwill need to accommodate both an acceptance of mobile\ntechnologies as devices that are useful and important to\nlearning, and an acceptance of stakeholder roles when\ninvolved in a learning activity itself, together with devel-\nopment of appropriate involvement practices.\n4 IMPLEMENTING MOBILE TECHNOLOGIES:\nTHEORIES AND CONSTRUCTS\nIn considering models and frameworks that will adequately\ndescribe and support mobile technology implementation, a\nstarting point is to consider a number of existing theories\nand frameworks that have described and modeled technol-\nogy adoption in schools. Hord et al. [14] proposed a\nframework that has been summarized in the Concerns-\nBased Adoption Model (CBAM) [15]. This model describes\nstaged approaches to implementation at the level of the\nindividual, where the individual moves through stages of\nconcern. These stages of concern move from level 0\n(awareness) to level 6 (refocusing). But, for any technology\nimplementation, what is important is to know what it is that\nhelps to move someone from one stage to another. For\nmobile technology implementation, what moves an indivi-\ndual from a stage 0 (awareness\u2014\u201cI am not concerned about\nit\u201d) to stage 1 (informational\u2014\u201cI would like to know more\nabout it\u201d) is fundamental to successful engagement and\npractice. Across the stages, concerns move from \u201cthe self,\u201d\nto \u201cthe task,\u201d and ultimately to \u201cthe impact.\u201d However,\nwhile the CBAM framework offers features that are of value\nin terms of the implementation of key learning activities, its\nshortcomings are concerned with its focus on the indivi-\ndual, rather than on ranges of stakeholders working in a\nrelated rather than in individual ways, and its lack of initial\nfocus on acceptances of technologies and involvement with\nthem. Concerns clearly have a major role to play within any\nimplementation framework selected for mobile technolo-\ngies, but initial engagement and involvement of a range of\nstakeholders is a fundamentally important requisite that\nmust be accommodated.\nIn terms of thinking more specifically about moving\nforward with implementation, Waycott [16] proposes a Tool\nIntegration Process (TIP) model that considers and accom-\nmodates both constraints and possibilities of how to use\ntechnologies as ways of mediating and developing new\noperations with new tools. Waycott includes community as\nan element to consider within the Activity System Tool\nAppropriation Model (ASTAM), but this element is dis-\ncussed in terms of the immediacy of impact of community\non the tasks being undertaken. The model does not easily\naccommodate implementation of mobile learning technol-\nogies within school and home settings, which requires a\nconcern for mediation and development of new operations\nwithin different, but maybe related settings.\nThinking about those involved in implementation, Rogers\n[17] identified different ways and times when different\nindividuals might be involved in implementation. He\nproposed a model that considered implementation from a\nuser perspective with different approaches to implementa-\ntion being labeled, such as \u201cinnovators\u201d and \u201cearly adop-\nters.\u201d Although interpreted more from a teacher than from a\npupil perspective, the model does implicitly suggest,\nperhaps, the important roles of interest, endeavor, and\npotential value that might be involved when individuals\napproach implementation. So, while Waycott [16] highlights\nthe importance of constraints and opportunities of use,\nRogers [17] highlights the importance of individual interest,\nendeavor, and enterprise factors (and arguably teachers\nmight be more concerned with these factors). The weakness\nof this model for mobile learning technology implementa-\ntion, however, is its reliance on observation of practice, rather\nthan providing a framework that offers intervention oppor-\ntunities through which to develop appropriate practice.\nDavis\u2019 earlier Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) [18]\ndiscusses the importance of technological usability and\nusefulness, so focuses more on the importance of a\ntechnology as a tool (or set of tools). Engestrom [19]\ndiscusses the importance of rules and regulations in\nimplementation, which implies the need to consider wider\nsocietal factors, such as legitimacy of activity. Engestrom\u2019s\nActivity Theory also introduces the important concept of\ndivision of labor, which is important when considering\nimplementations that include multiple stakeholders provid-\ning contributory involvement to a wider picture. However,\nfor the purposes of learning implementation led by schools,\nthe theory does not provide an easy structure through\nwhich important elements would be recognized or handled\nby managers or teachers in the schools.\nSome implementation models have indicated the impor-\ntance of stages, phases, or a series of steps, often concerned\nwith identifying early focal activities, and moving toward\nactivities set in wider contexts. Hooper and Rieber [20]\nproposed a five-step model, which moved from familiariza-\ntion (awareness) to replication (utilization and development)\nto integration (optimization) to modification (reorientation\n70 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES, VOL. 3, NO. 1, JANUARY-MARCH 2010\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library. Downloaded on June 08,2010 at 10:32:27 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. \nand pioneering), and finally, to transformation (evolution).\nThis model, which focuses on concepts of institutional\nimplementation as much as individual implementation,\nechoes the stages proposed in the CBAM construct. Those\nimplementing new technologies, taking concepts within the\nHooper and Rieber model, face the need to consider not only\nthe factors and needs of individuals during implementation\npractices, but also wider perspectives concerned with\ninstitutional implementation. While schools often use\nphased implementation frameworks, and those external to\nschools in agencies such as local authorities or regional\nsupport units often propose them, these frameworks focus\non activity within the school, rather than highlighting the\nneed to consider a wider systemic view from the outset.\nWithin phased frameworks, challenges of implementation of\nnew technologies need to accommodate specific factors such\nas the impact dip, as discussed by Fullan [21], explored in the\ncontext of technology implementation byMevarech [22], and\ndescribed and illustrated as a U-curve with downward\nimpact prior to increased positive impact. This concept\nindicates that implementation of new activities may well\nlead after an initial phase to a dip in impact; if impacts are\nmeasured at that time, and impacts are recognized by key\nstakeholders to have shifted negatively, then the longer term\nmore positive impacts may well not arise if implementation\nis foreshortened. Commitment of a longer term nature, as\nwell as a shorter term nature, is therefore potentially\nimportant for successful implementation. However, no\nspecific dips in impact have been measured and identified\nthrough studies looking at implementation of mobile\ntechnologies, and this may be due to the short period of\ntime taken to move from operational use to application to\nlearning.\nCorbett and Rossman [23] have argued that less direct\nor explicit factors, which lie beyond the immediacy of the\nclassroom or school itself, are also fundamentally impor-\ntant for successful implementation of activity. They argued\nthat there were three paths that implementation might\nfollow: a technical path (focusing on technological im-\nplementation or activity implementation), a political path\n(focusing on personal or professional interest, endeavor or\nenterprise), and a cultural path (focusing on how activities\nmatch with interests and endeavors of the users rather than\nthe providers). These latter authors stressed that the most\nsuccessful projects involved implementation practices that\naccounted for all of these paths, rather than one or two of\nthese paths. A fundamentally important factor to consider\nin terms of implementation of mobile technologies, due to\ntheir mobility, access, and facilities, is the range of \u201cactors\u201d\nthat are involved, how they are involved, and the\nindividual contributory elements that need to be accom-\nmodated for each \u201cactor\u201d in terms of technical, political,\nand cultural paths. Technologies that were introduced and\nimplemented in the past are now used to lesser or greater\nextents, but generally have not embraced the development\nof a systemic learning environment. If adoption of mobile\nlearning technologies is to enable social learning and\neducational purpose, then it will involve a range of\nstakeholders and their acceptance of systemic develop-\nment. The importance of selected activities using technol-\nogy, the mediation or adaptation of use according to\ncontext, and the influences of and on the stakeholders\nclearly make the implementation of mobile technologies a\ncase that involves \u201cchange\u201d and involves \u201csystemic\nchange.\u201d Corbett and Rossman\u2019s implementation paths\nmatch the important elements that need to be considered\nin terms of an implementation framework for mobile\nlearning technologies. But, as learning activities are clearly\ncentrally important to successful and appropriate imple-\nmentation, as learning that is socially constructed and\nconversationally constructed can be supported through\nmobile learning technologies, it can be argued that a fourth\npath needs to be specifically identified\u2014a learning activity\npath. The four paths (learning activity, technical, political,\nand cultural), coupled with a concern for each stakeholder\n(pupils, teachers, school managers, local authority or\nproject consultants, and parents), are selected here as a\nframework (\u201ca systemic implementation framework for\nmobile technologies\u201d).\nThe next two sections in the paper show how schools\nhave been involved in forms of \u201csystemic change.\u201d The two\ncase studies involved pupils and teachers in different\ngeographical and local areas, with different technologies,\nand with a different focus on learning. The case studies will\nbe used to describe and detail the four paths in the modified\nCorbett and Rossman systemic implementation framework.\nIn particular, elements that show relationships between the\npaths will be highlighted. At the same time, this will\ndemonstrate the important role of the learning activity path.\n5 IMPLEMENTING MOBILE TECHNOLOGIES: A FIRST\nSYSTEMIC CASE STUDY\nA first case study conducted by the author, briefly reported\nelsewhere [7], highlights practices that support \u201ca systemic\nimplementation framework for mobile technologies.\u201d The\ncase study is reported using elements suggested by Yin [24]:\nan overview of the case study project (its objectives, issues,\nand topics being investigated), field procedures (including\nrole of the researcher, access to sites, and sources of\ninformation including documents, interviews, and direct\nobservation), case study questions (specific questions that\nthe investigator explored during data collection), and an\nanalysis of the results (in terms of relevance and relation-\nship to the proposed framework).\nThe case study project was run as one initial element of a\nlong-term regeneration program in a local community area.\nThe initiative involved two primary schools in a locality\nwith high socioeconomic deprivation, some 70 pupils in\ntotal (three classes of Year 6 pupils, 10 to 11 years of age),\nand provided them with individual personal digital\nassistants (PDAs). The PDAs were equipped with a wide\nrange of utilities and software, selected to support educa-\ntional uses across a range of subjects. The purpose of the\ninitiative was to support attainment in core subjects, so there\nwas a particular focus on uses of devices for literacy\npractices. Those pupils previously attending the schools in\nYear 5 (which included most of the 70 pupils) had gained\nprior experience of using PDAs. The teachers and teaching\nassistants involved with the Year 6 classes in the project\n(3 teachers and 3 teaching assistants) had no prior PDA\nexperience, and encountered this technology for the first\ntime. Initial training was provided for the teachers and\nPASSEY: MOBILE LEARNING IN SCHOOL CONTEXTS: CAN TEACHERS ALONE MAKE IT HAPPEN? 71\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library. Downloaded on June 08,2010 at 10:32:27 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. \nteaching assistants, with a project consultant providing\nongoing weekly support for both schools. The PDAs had\nwireless and Internet access in school, but only a limited\nnumber of pupils had access to Internet facilities outside the\nschool. Pupils initially used the devices in school only, but\nafter a short time, teachers encouraged pupils to take them\nhome, to support learning activities at home as well as at\nschool. The project consultant identified relevant learning\nactivities, and teachers used these activities within class\nlessons and to provide activities that pupils could continue\nat home, while school ICT co-coordinators provided addi-\ntional in-school support (mostly operational). Most uses of\nPDAs focused on specific aspects of literacy (reading,\nspelling, and the use of vocabulary particularly). There\nwas some limited use for writing (mainly associated with\nnote taking), and for aspects of science, numeracy, video,\nimage, and data capture. Typically, pupils read e-books,\nused an e-book dictionary as an instant learning tool, and\ntraditional books were read alongside e-books for literature\ncomparison purposes. Folders were created to collect, store,\nand allow specific groups of words to be reviewed, such as\n\u201cwow\u201d words and connectives, with a focus on punctuation,\nstory openers, connective usage, and vocabulary. Pupils\nwrote a factual newspaper topic using annotation features of\nMS PowerPoint.MS Pocket Excelwas used to look at averages,\naddition, multiplication, and formulas of differing kinds.\nScience records were taken of decay over time, captured as a\nphotographic record. Images were captured, of mysterious,\ndilapidated buildings in the locality, as a stimulus to\ngenerate ideas for writing ghost stories. A local heritage\nsite was visited, with PDAs used to capture images and take\nnotes about costume drama activities led by the heritage site\nstaff to show details about the Tudor period, written up into\nan e-book for pupils to share with others. Spellings were\nrevised, with one pupil group collating spellings as bothMS\nPocket Word and sound files. An after-school club was run\neach school term, with some 15 pupils attending. Pairs of\npupils developed short story writing, following discussion\nabout author techniques with the project consultant. The\nrecording tool was used to create sound files that acted as\nreminders for pupils of how to upgrade their written work.\nThe author was engaged by the regeneration project as an\nevaluator. The evaluation was undertaken independently;\nno direct intervention was involved, but some verbal\nfeedback was given to the project consultant. A range of\nevidence was gathered from different stakeholders: struc-\ntured individual interviews with open questions (four\nschool ICT co-coordinators, 89 pupils, eight teachers, eight\nparents, four project consultants); four lesson observations;\nreviews of four items of pupil work; three sets of class results\nfor writing and reading and two sets for spelling; two project\nconsultant reports; and sets of national test (SATs) results for\nEnglish, mathematics, and science for four successive years.\nThe evaluator explored aspects of the project concerned\nwith management, implementation, learning activity devel-\nopment, learning outcomes, and responses of the various\nstakeholders. Questions posed by the evaluator (at two\nseparate stages of the project) gathered feedback from\nstakeholders about training and ongoing support, ease of\nuse of the devices and facilities provided, what learning\nactivities the devices were used for (and in what subject\ntopics), when pupils started to take PDAs home, whether\nteachers had evidence of enhanced learning in terms of\nreading, writing, spelling, and communication skills, the\nprofile of literacy in the schools, reactions of pupils to the\ndevices and learning activities, what perceptions and\nreactions of parents were, whether they felt they had\nbecome more interested or involved in their children\u2019s\nwork, whether they felt their children\u2019s work had im-\nproved, whether they had used the PDAs, their involve-\nment in supporting aspects of literacy, whether pupils felt\nthe devices had helped with reading, writing, spelling,\ncommunication skills, doing \u201cbetter\u201d work, more work, and\nhad led to increased engagement or interest in learning\nactivities with their parents, and interests shown by\nemployers, the media, or the wider community.\nAfter two months of use, a first round of initial\nevaluation evidence was gathered. During those initial\ntwo months, pupil uses had mostly focused on the\noperation of the PDAs, but teachers had developed use\nfor spelling practice (chosen for use when and as the pupil\nwanted, with or without help of peers or parents). Teachers,\nafter two months of use of this facility, reported impacts on\nspelling. One teacher commented on the value gained when\npupils were able to record spellings of words using their\nown voice, taking opportunities to revise them frequently.\nListening to how to spell words, as well as reading the\nspellings, was felt to enhance memorization, retention,\nrehearsal, and recall. This initial implementation period was\nclearly crucial in terms of engaging the various stakeholders\nin the initiative. The learning activity path at that time\nfocused on spelling. This form of focus met the needs of the\nregeneration program, as well as the needs of the school,\nand the likely interests (and involvement) of parents. From\nan implementation framework perspective, this learning\nactivity involved and related to other key aspects. Training\nand support in the operation of the devices allowed this\nlearning activity to be undertaken quickly (technical\naspects). Spelling was recognized as a key basic learning\nneed, highlighted nationally, recognized by school man-\nagers and teachers as being an aspect that needed to be\npracticed and developed, and recognized by parents as\nbeing a critical, basic skill set (political aspects). National\ninterest in enhancing improved spelling was highlighted by\nthe media; school managers and teachers wanted pupils to\ntake an interest in improving their spelling, and they\nwanted parents to be involved and interested in supporting\nand encouraging this practice (cultural aspects). Critically\nimportant was the focus at that early stage, from the outset\nof the initiative, on a learning activity path that would\ninvolve and relate to the technical path (how to use the\ndevices), the political path (engaging and involving all key\nstakeholders from the outset), and the cultural path (meet-\ning the interests of as many stakeholders as possible). The\ninitiative started by supporting political and cultural path\ninvolvement, rather than focusing just on the learning\nactivity and technical paths.\nAfter six months of use, a second round of evaluation\nevidence was gathered, and uses for learning had widened.\nOf 60 pupils interviewed, all except one were engaging\n72 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES, VOL. 3, NO. 1, JANUARY-MARCH 2010\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Restrictions apply. \npositively with use of the PDAs, and 54 of the pupils were\nable to recognize and state specific features of PDAs that\nthey said helped with spelling. Spelling results retained in\nboth schools suggested that pupils were improving in terms\nof their spelling (although it was not possible to make a\ncomparison of these results with those of other independent\ngroups to check whether this improvement might have been\nexpected without the use of PDAs). Importantly, enhanced\nsocial levels of interaction for learners were reported\u2014\nparents had become more involved in their children\u2019s\nschoolwork once the pupils had taken the PDAs home. Of\nthe 60 pupils interviewed, 57 said that parents or family\nwere more involved. Of these pupils, 42 gave details of how\ntheir parents or family were more involved. The ways most\ncommonly reported were helping them to revise for tests,\nwith times tables, with reading, or with schoolwork\ngenerally (in 17 cases), and regular checking of work (in\n16 cases). Interviews with eight parents indicated that they\nwere generally positive about the focus and nature of the\ninitiative. One parent reported that the medium had helped\nhis child (with autistic tendencies), to express emotions and\nfeelings more, as the child was able to write in response or\nwhen relevant, rather than having to say things in response,\nwhich was much more challenging for the child. Many\nparents and family members of the 60 pupils involved had\nused the PDAs, often supporting activities involving\nliteracy. But the PDAs remained personal tools rather than\ntools shared across the family. At this stage, in terms of\nimplementation paths, it was clear that while learning\nactivities had widened, they were still created in ways that\nwould allow the other three paths to develop at the same\ntime. While the learning activity path involved reading,\nwriting, numeracy, and data capture to greater extents, the\nother paths were accommodated at the same time. The\ntechnical path developed\u2014gaining more experience and\ntraining in using different device features, and sharing these\nwith parents. The political path developed\u2014maintaining a\nfocus on learning recognized as being nationally important,\nimportant for teachers and schoolmanagers, and for parents.\nThe cultural path developed\u2014allowing learning activities to\nbe brought to the awareness of parents, and involving\nparents in ways that allowed topics to be introduced and\npracticed in conversation, and through discussion.\nPupils, teachers, and parents recognized that impacts on\nlearning were more effective when PDAs were used along-\nside or with other resources (human interactions). This\nconclusion is supported by findings from a separate study\nreported by the author [7], which explored impacts of a\nproject that developed a range of multimedia resources for\naccess on PDAs. In this case, learning using mobile\ntechnologies was evidenced in informal as well as formal\nlearning settings. Some pupils were involved in learning\nactivities that supported the learning of others. For example,\nsome pupils produced imageswith text and audio, andmade\nthese accessible to a Chinese girl (a non-English speaker), to\nhelp her learn English. This example involved potentially\nhigh-level aspects of learning (analysis, synthesis, evalua-\ntion), as well as emphasizing the role and impacts of \u201ccaring\nas thinking\u201d (Lipman [25]). Across that project, some\nmothers reported having a greater awareness of what was\nhappening in terms of learning and other activities in the\nschool, and being able to monitor what was happening to\ntheir children in terms of learning on a day-to-day basis.\nThey reported enhanced confidence, that their children were\nmore creative and more enthusiastic, and that their literacy\nhad moved on more. Sharing, both with peers and with\nparents, was recognized as an outcome and as having\nimpact, with pupils talking more about their learning (how,\nas well as what). It was reported that applications were in\nsome cases encouraging discussion about learning, and that\nthis was happening to a greater extent than had happened\nwhen the focus of discussion was through subject or topic\ncontent. Pupils felt that they could learn at any time, and that\nthe features enhanced their persistence (what one local\nauthority consultant called \u201cstickability\u201d). The project was\nreported to have opened up new dimensions for some\nteachers. A teacher of hockey encouraged pupils (9 to\n10 years of age) to capture video, images, and audio during\na hockey match, to interview players to find out what they\nfelt, and to keep a record of results. This allowed all the\npupils in the class to be engaged\u2014including those not able to\nplay. Software features of the PDAs allowed aspects of a\nscience lesson to be captured on video (by 11 to 12 year old\npupils) and for details of the experiment and the results to be\n\u201cwritten up\u201d as they happened in MS Word or MS Excel.\nUsing other software features, pupils were able to access\nmaterial to revise, or to create revision tools (a flip chart of the\nanimation of a life cycle of pollination, for example). Again,\nforms of learning activities were central to implementation,\nand while the learning activity path involved activities that\nincluded important social and societal aspects, they also\ninvolved the three other paths. The technical path was\ninvolved as learners needed to develop uses of specific\nsoftware and features to undertake successive learning\nactivities, but also doing this through sharing anddiscussion.\nThe political path was involved, as different stakeholders\nwere involved, in aspects that they felt were important. The\ncultural path was involved, as parents and others were\ninvolved actively in encouragement for and contributing to\nthe learning needs and outcomes of their children.\nThat implementation adequately considers each of the\nfour paths is reinforced by evidence from other research into\nuses of mobile learning technologies. The importance of the\ncultural path was indicated in a study [4] that looked at\nlearning involvement where mobile device use matched\nexperiences and practices that young people were already\nengaged in. This study of pilots involving nearly 250 \u201chard\nto reach\u201d learners (aged 16 to 24 years) in the UK, Italy, and\nSweden reported that \u201csmartphones\u201d could provide ways to\nmotivate numbers of young adults who were not in\nemployment, education, or training, with about four out of\nfive young people reporting that they felt mobile games\ncould help them to improve reading, spelling, or mathe-\nmatics. However, it should not be assumed that access to\nmobile technologies would in itself lead to learning\nengagement, without implementation and provision of\nadequate support and preparation. A recent study for Becta\n(Passey et al. [26]) indicated the importance of the technical\npath. Although evidence in this research suggested that\nyoung people have wide access to mobile (and less mobile)\nPASSEY: MOBILE LEARNING IN SCHOOL CONTEXTS: CAN TEACHERS ALONE MAKE IT HAPPEN? 73\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Restrictions apply. \ntechnologies, the technologies usedmainly for learning were\ncomputers with Internet access and televisions, both much\nmore fixed than mobile. Mobility features were reported by\nthese young people to be used for social purposes, while\nlinks to learning through mobile technologies were not\nstrongly made bymany of these young people. Teachers and\nschools have vital roles to play; they can provide access to\nand involvement with mobile technologies to support\nlearning. But learners are only likely to be able to gain from\nthis effectively and in the longer term if mobile learning\ntechnologies are implemented with an adequate focus on all\nthe four implementation paths.\n6 IMPLEMENTING MOBILE TECHNOLOGIES:\nA SECOND SYSTEMIC CASE STUDY\nThe second case study looks in more detail at implementa-\ntion integrating all four implementation paths, and indi-\ncates how a school in a geographical location separate from\nthe first case study school employed strategies to do this.\nThe case study is reported using the same elements as those\nin the first case study (Yin [24]).\nThis second case study describes the introduction and\nimplementation of sets of handheld mobile devices in a\nprimary school located in a suburban area. The school\nprovides for a wide catchment population, with some\n48 percent of pupils coming from outside the immediate\nlocality, many from local council wards with high levels of\nsocial deprivation. With pupils from widely mixed back-\ngrounds, the school is concerned that it provides a learning\nenvironment for pupils who have different starting points,\nwith regard to prior learning, social confidence and literacy,\nand levels of background opportunity. The school is\nconcerned that pupils\u2019 social aspects, as well as their\nlearning, can be developed positively. The head teacher\nran a mobile learning project in a previous school. From that\nexperience, he felt that mobile learning devices could\nsupport the learning and wider social needs of a specific\nyear group within the school. This group had a higher\nnumber of pupils with special educational needs (14 out of\n66), compared to the attainment performance of prior Year 5\ngroups. The school secured a number of handheld mobile\ndevices some two months before the end of a school year so\nthat pupils and teachers could explore aspects of use before\nthe start of a new school year. Three teachers and 66 pupils\naged 9 to 10 years in three Year 5 classes were each provided\nwith a mobile device that could access the Internet via the\nschool wireless network. The mobile devices were provided\nfor this year group with the intention of supporting more\npositive engagement with learning, and of supporting their\nlearning to improve performance in the longer term.\nThe classes were streamed for numeracy and literacy\nlessons, but otherwise they worked in registration groups\n(in mixed groups). For streamed numeracy and literacy\nsessions, there were three streams\u2014a highest attaining\nstream and two other equal groups. Teaching assistants\nwere deployed across the three classes, and worked in\ndifferent classes and groups according to the particular\nneeds of those groups. The Year 5 rooms where the three\nclasses were taught were arranged loosely in an open-plan\npattern, each having an interactive whiteboard, with three\ncomputers and a monitor located centrally. The teachers,\ntaking advice from the head teacher and a local authority\n(LA) consultant, devised activities and managed uses of the\ndevices both to engage the pupils and provide learning\nactivities that would support specific learning intentions. In\ngeneral, pupils used the mobile learning devices in school\nevery day, in activities appropriate and relevant to the\ncurriculum prepared by the teachers (who worked jointly\non lesson planning). Pupils typically used mathematical\ngames to practice certain techniques, to take notes during\nlessons to develop into reports or stories later, and to take\nimages of plants and animals in outside locations and using\na biological key to identify them. They took images of leaves\nover a time period and created a presentation to show\nchanges over time, used a spell checking resource to\npractice the spelling of specific words, and took images or\nvideo of physical education activities, keeping scores, and\ntaking notes to create sports reports later. They accessed\nhomework assignments on the learning platform, complet-\ning and uploading them onto the platform. They accessed\nand researched details about specific topics including local\nheritage sites using the Internet, wrote in a range of genres,\nincluding writing from different points of view, and created\naudio files of a partner\u2019s story. The LA consultant attended\nregularly one day a week from the outset of the initiative\nand taught classes different ways to use the devices. He\ntook on the role of technical troubleshooting where possible,\nsupporting access to and content on a learning platform\nprovided by the LA. Pupils used the devices in lessons, and\nat breaks and lunch times, in the playground and in outside\nareas. Pupils took the devices home; parents owned the\nmobile devices (they paid a monthly fee). Mobile devices\nwere charged at home, at least once a week, and it was\nrecommended that this be done on Sundays. Technical\nsupport came from the LA; technical jobs were accumulated\nand these were addressed within half a day each week. If\nproblems arose unexpectedly, the school ICT coordinator\naddressed issues where possible on a day-to-day basis.\nThe school was selected for case study exploration\ninitially because it was recognized by a national technology\nsolution provider as being a lead school in terms of\nimplementation of mobile devices integrated with other\nforms of technological support. The school agreed to\ninvolvement for case study purposes, and the author\nundertook an independent case study evaluation. The\nevaluation was not intended to provide any direct inter-\nvention, although feedback was given to the school so that it\nmight consider ongoing and longer term approaches.\nEvidence was gathered during two visits to the school,\nand comprised: individual semistructured interviews with\nopen questions (two head teachers, 36 pupils in groups of\nfour to six, six teachers, one parent, two LA consultants);\nthree lesson observations; and a review of the LA con-\nsultant\u2019s learning log. The learning log, maintained by the\nLA consultant for his own purposes, described learning\ninteractions arising each week, and this was made\naccessible to the author.\nThe evaluator explored aspects of the project concerned\nwith management, implementation, learning activity\ndevelopment, learning outcomes, and responses of the\n74 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES, VOL. 3, NO. 1, JANUARY-MARCH 2010\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Questions posed by the evaluator\nprovided feedback from the stakeholders about training\nand ongoing support, ease of use of the devices and\nfacilities provided, what learning activities the devices\nwere used for (and in what subject topics), when pupils\nstarted to take the mobile devices home, whether teachers\nfelt or had evidence of enhanced engagement with\nlearning and enhanced outcomes of learning in terms of\nresearching, reading, writing, spelling, communication\nskills, and independent learning, when and how often\npupils used the devices, the reactions of pupils to the\ndevices and learning activities, whether pupils felt they\nhad become more interested or involved in their work,\nwhether parents felt their children\u2019s work had improved,\nand whether pupils felt the devices had helped them with\nlearning skills, reading, writing, spelling, communication\nskills, doing \u201cbetter\u201d work, more work, and whether use\nof the devices at home had led to increased engagement\nor interest in learning activities with their parents.\nIt is of note that both in this project, and in the project\ndescribed in the first case study, the implementation of\nmobile learning devices happened quickly, within a matter\nof months. Phased implementation frameworks, therefore,\nmay well have limited value in terms of introduction of\nthese forms of device. This rapid introduction in preparing\nfor a wider implementation appears to be due to at least\nfour factors. First, the devices are portable, degrees of\nownership are high, use is made of the devices very often,\nand high levels of practice lead to high levels of operational\nfacility very quickly. Second, forms of systemic implemen-\ntation of the types described enable users to gain from the\nwider experience and involvement of all those included,\nwith pupils sharing their experiences and knowledge with\nteachers and parents, and vice versa, leading to levels of use\nbased on shared systemic knowledge. Third, the focus on\nlearning activities that then develop operational abilities\nsupports engagement of all stakeholders. Fourth, involve-\nment of an LA consultant, coupled with support from a\nhead teacher and commitment from teachers, provides\nforms of reflection and feedback that drive forward\ndevelopment positively.\nIn terms of the systemic implementation framework,\nfeatures were identified through the case study that showed\nthe roles of and interactions between each of the four paths.\nAt an early stage of the pilot, it was clear from feedback that\nimplementation had been successfully managed at a\nnumber of levels. There was no malicious use or damage\nreported, devices were reported to be working without\nmajor problem, and pupils were reported to be very highly\nmotivated (with other year groups indicating their desire to\nbe involved also). It was found that Internet access was\nessential\u2014even at the outset of the pilot it was clear that\nproblems arose if this access was not available. The success\nof the initial introduction of mobile technologies clearly\nrelied in part upon the school\u2019s management and planning\nof pupil and parent expectations\u2014pupils were shown in\nadvance when to turn off the volume on their machines, and\nthe need to charge batteries, for example. Themobile devices\nwere used in school routinely, every day, but selectively,\naccording to appropriateness and relevance. Initially,\nteachers judged this appropriateness and relevance, but\nafter only a few months, pupils themselves were given the\nresponsibility to make and take such judgments. The\nlearning activities selected and devised by the teachers were\nclearly vitally important; they engaged the children in\nschool, but were also linked to the needs identified by the\nschool management, and to the interests of parents\n(supporting the political path). The fact that parents owned\nthe mobile devices and paid a monthly sum and that they\nwere charged at home also supported the political path\n(parental commitment and interest was maintained and\nmanaged). But it also supported the cultural path, as parents\nwere involved in maintaining elements of a systemic\nlearning environment, including the home and outside\nareas such as a car or a garden, and the school and its\noutside areas. Additionally, the technical path was sup-\nported, as parents were involved in maintaining charged\nunits and liaising if technical faults arose (also involving the\nLA, who provided regular technical support).\nDiscussions with groups of pupils (12 pupils in total),\nfour months after they received the mobile devices,\nindicated a range of outcomes that highlighted how\nlearning activities were supporting aspects of the technical,\npolitical, and cultural paths (as well as focusing on\nimportant learning aspects associated with social and\nsocietal interactions). Pupils reported that they used the\nmobile devices in lessons routinely, on occasions each day,\nand also a great deal at home. They reported that mobile\ndevices were enhancing learning opportunities and ways\nthat learning could be developed. In an example described\nby all pupils interviewed, pictures were taken of wildlife, of\nplants and animals in different locations. These pictures\nwere used with a resource called Wild Key (a range of\nbiological keys to help identify animals, plants, leaves, and\ntrees, linked to habitats), as they could be viewed when\nanswering questions in the key. Some pupils afterward\nused Wild Key at home to look at and identify minibeasts.\nThis practice supported an important transfer of learning,\nuse of techniques in different locations and in different\ncontexts. It also involved both a societal and social\ndimension, as parents could see what sorts of practice their\nchildren were involved in, and had the potential to discuss\nthis with their children, which, in turn, supported aspects of\nthe cultural implementation path. Many pupils felt that\nhomework could be done more easily, and one pupil\nreported completing homework in the family car; again, the\ncultural path was supported by this practice. The devices\nalso provided choice; different pupils did writing in\ndifferent ways, using a keyboard or a stylus. This offered\nchoice for the pupil, and supported both political and\ntechnical paths in terms of selection and use. These paths\nwere also supported as pupils could write using the mobile\ndevices. This method was preferred in some cases as\nspelling could be checked more easily, the writing process\nfelt more comfortable, and the device allowed writing to be\ndone more quickly (potentially matching cognitive speed to\nmotor speed for some pupils). The fact that pupils were\nengaging in writing, and parents could see this, also\nsupported the political path for the parent, since parents\nalready recognized the importance and value of writing and\nPASSEY: MOBILE LEARNING IN SCHOOL CONTEXTS: CAN TEACHERS ALONE MAKE IT HAPPEN? 75\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library. Downloaded on June 08,2010 at 10:32:27 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. \nspelling. Examples also indicated how selected learning\nactivities could support cultural and political paths for both\nparents and pupils. Mathematical games were accessed by\none boy when on holiday to find out how to carry out\ncertain tasks in mathematics. For his parents, the political\npath was supported, as mathematical abilities are recog-\nnized as being important, and the cultural path was\nsupported, as the parent is providing the opportunity for\nthat activity and practice to take place. For the pupil, the\npolitical path is supported, as interest in mathematics can\nbe fulfilled, and the cultural path is supported, as the parent\nis providing the opportunity, and the teacher and school are\nproviding and pointing to the available resource. Some\npupils reported undertaking learning activities that allowed\nthem to pursue more independent learning. One boy took\nimages of leaves each day and created a slide show to show\nchanges over time. Literacy, writing, and correcting spelling\nwere a focus for one girl, while for a number of pupils,\ninformation from the Internet could be accessed easily and\nused at home and in school. Other pupils reported under-\ntaking learning activities that clearly supported the cultural\npath, involving levels of social interactions. Images or video\nof physical education activities were recorded, scores were\nkept, and notes were made and reported later. Some pupil\nwork was shown, discussed, and shared through the\nclassroom interactive whiteboard. Homework or pictures\ncould be completed or taken and then accessed easily in\nschool. The voice recorder was used to record a partner\u2019s\nstory about what they did on holiday.\nAs the project progressed, connectivity issues highlighted\nthe importance of the technical path, and it was clear how\nthis affected the cultural path (limiting access to opportunity\nas needed) and the learning activities path (limiting access to\nsubject and topic details, and learning exploration routes as\nneeded). Technical, cultural, and political paths for pupils\nand parents were supported strongly by pupil involvement\nin an online course. Teachers offered a mobile technology\ncourse provided by Roehampton University [27], introduced\nso that some pupils were completing it six months into the\nschool year. Within weeks of starting it, 35 pupils had\ncompleted the course and had passed Level 1, while all\npupils completed it and were presented with certificates at a\nspecial celebration event within a few months. Teachers and\nthe LA consultant recognized that a range of pupils had\nbecome highly proficient in terms of using the mobile\ndevices as they were completing the course. The technical\nexpertise of some pupils had developed to the point where it\nwas possible to consider deploying \u201cexperts\u201d in teams, to\ndevelop the sharing of practice. It was felt that such\ndeployment could support wider and longer term develop-\nment of independent learning, encouraging discussion with\npeers, at home, in school, and during break times. It was\nclear that the technical path had been supported (pupils\nwere gaining operational abilities), the political path had\nbeen supported (parents recognized the value of the course\ncertificate), and the cultural path had been supported\n(pupils were sharing their abilities across a learning network\nof peers, teachers, and parents).\nThe learning network that was developing was sup-\nported positively by access to a learning platform. Pupils\nwere able to access a range of facilities from the LA learning\nplatform through their mobile devices at the same time as\nthey were taking their online course. They were able to log\non and access specific Year 5 pages and resources. They\ncould access homework provided by teachers and could\nupload their homework. They were able to access e-books,\nWebsite links (such as links to sites about space), Websites\noffering resources created by local historical and heritage\nsites (images and audio), and software programs (in case\nthese programs were lost from their mobile devices). The\nlearning platform played an important role in providing\nsharing opportunities across schools; 15 primary schools in\nthe LA used the learning platform with pupils and had\ndone so for 2 years prior to that date. The LA consultant set\nup discussions that all of these schools could contribute to,\nand pupils at the case study school contributed to some of\nthese discussions. Access and use of the platform clearly\nsupported the technical path, sharing opportunities sup-\nported the cultural path, and the reported value of making\ncontact with others outside the school supported the\npolitical path.\nHomework played an important part in the support of\nimplementation paths. Homework was completed using\nhandheld mobile devices. Pupils were set one homework\nactivity each week, these were completed at home, and the\nfiles were uploaded to a specifically named folder (and\npupils were able to see everyone else\u2019s homework too).\nDuring one specific week, for example, the homework set\nwaswritten froma \u201cdifferent point of view.\u201d The teacherwas\nable to access some pupils\u2019 work from the folder access area\non the learning platform and discuss these using the\ninteractive whiteboard facility with all pupils in the class.\nHomework being managed and completed in this way was\nreported to have positive effects on parents. Parents reported\nto teachers that their children told them more about their\nhomework and work generally. Parent reports indicated\nrecognition of the technical path (parents could see the\ntechnical abilities of pupils needed to undertake these\nactivities), the political path (the value of the device and\nthe system in which it operated was being recognized), and\nthe cultural path (the parent was becomingmore involved in\nthe system, and more aware of what was happening).\nImportant outcomes relating to individual children were\nrecognized and reported by some parents. A parent reported\nto the head teacher that a child used the device to look at\nwhat he had done previously and to look at what he needed\nto do at the beginning of each day. He did this in themorning\n(at a time and place to suit him); it was clear that he could not\neasily have done this in the same way without the mobile\ndevice. The device offered him ease of access, and enabled\nhim to review his learning, using the device both as a\nreflective medium but also as a preparative medium. Both\nthe pupil and parent were seeing benefits and becoming\nmore involved in the overall learning network. Another\nparent of a boy in one class, who provided some direct\nfeedback about her experiences, indicated that she thought\nthat the mobile device had brought about noticeable changes\nin her son. At an operational level, the large positive\ndifference that was noticeable was confidence in use of the\nmobile device, working on it independently, being able to\n76 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES, VOL. 3, NO. 1, JANUARY-MARCH 2010\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Although the monthly\npayment was felt to be quite high, it was recognized at the\nsame time that the device was used a lot, in almost every\nlesson, and the level of use inside and outside school was felt\nto warrant the cost involved (relating to the political path). A\ndifference that she noticed was her son\u2019s abilities with\nliteracy when the mobile device was used. Although the boy\n\u201cstruggled with literacy\u201d generally, this was not the case\nwhen the mobile device was used, as he could seek and gain\nhelp from other pupils (relating to both the political and\ncultural paths). There was an associated recognized rise in\nhis interest in aspects of learning, and his view of barriers to\nreading that had existed previously did not manifest\nthemselves in the same way. Overall, a \u201cdramatic change\u201d\nwas reported in terms of engagement with and increased\nindependence in learning. It meant that he then had\nsomething positive that he wanted to do at home on dark\nnights when there was bad weather. The parent was\nimpressed with what he had done, and she felt he had\n\u201cgrown up,\u201d taking more ownership and responsibility for\nitems such as the mobile device (relating to both the political\nand cultural paths). The parent felt that the approaches taken\nby teachers were encouraging greater responsibility levels,\ninculcating individual responsibility at the same time as\nencouraging sharing, so that children were not embarrassed\nto ask others for help (which the parent felt would not be\nexpected in other circumstances). With Year 5 being the only\ngroup with mobile devices, the parent felt that this enhanced\nself-esteem of this group, it encouraged them to talk readily\nto each other, and might well be leading to greater social\ncohesion and participation. The parent was indicating\nsuccessful outcomes relating to the intentions and aims of\nthe project set out by the head teacher. At the same time, the\nparent was indicating the importance of the four paths\u2014the\nforms of learning activity involved, the operational abilities\nand access to facilities provided, the value of the outcomes\nand how they were applied to the child\u2019s individual\ncircumstances, and the opportunities that were afforded in\nterms of social contact and cohesion.\nWhen pupils were half way through their Year 5 school\nyear, they reported on uses of mobile devices within\nclassrooms, in the school outside classrooms, and at home,\nwhich indicated that learning activity, technical, political,\nand cultural paths had been managed and implemented\nsuccessfully, both for them, and by them. Relating to the\nlearning activity path, they reported that they used the\nhandheld mobile devices a lot to complete homework\nactivities, involving writing, drawing, saving and carrying\non working whenever it was possible (in a car, for example),\nstoring and inserting pictures, spell checking without a\nteacher being there, downloading e-books, searching on the\nInternet, taking pictures on holiday and writing about them,\nusing resources such as Textwise, Paint, Smart Notebook, MS\nPowerPoint, Pocket Slides, putting files together with ease,\nusing different sources rather than being constrained by\ndetails only available in books, taking notes and photos in\nlessons or outside school, helping them to write stories or a\nnewspaper report, and accessing games (such as Textwise,\nSums Online, Bubblebreaker, to help with learning). Relating\nto the technical path, they reported that the handheld\ndevices were easy to use, as use did not involve having to\ncarry papers, that it was easy to carry them around, as they\ncould be put around their neck or on a belt, that they could\nuse an overview keyboard for writing something short, or a\nlarger keyboard for longer writing, that the learning\nplatform facilities were easy to access, and files could easily\nbe handled, uploaded, or downloaded. Relating to the\npolitical path, they reported that the handheld mobile\ndevices encouraged parents to ask about and take interest in\ntheir work, they could show their parents how to use Pocket\nSlides, show photos of class activities to parents, and use a\ntranscriber to check handwriting. They said that these\nactivities led to parents being more interested in their work\nthan if they had done it by hand or in a book, as parents\ncould see more easily what they had been doing at school.\nRelating to the cultural path, they reported that the\nhandheld mobile devices allowed them to enjoy work\nmore, that they were used at break times, to exchange files,\ngames, or images, to send things to each other, such as\nexchanging music files, and through SynchonEyes, allowing\nteachers to see what was happening.\nTeachers reported success against initial intentions at\nthat time. They reported that some pupils were engaging\nmore in foundation subjects and literacy. They reported that\nthe mobile devices allowed research to happen prior to\nsubjects being undertaken in class, and that this preparation\nhad an impact on engagement. Teachers reported that\npupils were offered more choices through technological\nfeatures and that the skills of some pupils meant that\nchildren were communicating and asking more as a\nconsequence. While teachers were enhancing independent\nlearning and the responsibility for learning, pupils were\nincreasing in terms of their self-confidence and self-esteem,\nresponsibility, and communication.\nThe positive indicators of success across the pilot were\nclearly associated with the four paths of implementation,\nintegrated through activities and actions for and with the\nstakeholders involved: a positive lead and ongoing support\nprovided by the head teacher; the direction and forms of\nactivities that were introduced by the three class teachers;\nthe ongoing support and ideas offered by the LA con-\nsultant; the continued willingness of parents to invest in the\ndevices and to be increasingly interested in their children\u2019s\nlearning; and the engagement of pupils with the facilities\nand their willingness to share and contribute ideas and\noutcomes. Pupils, teachers, and parents all reported positive\nimpacts arising. In particular, they reported on successes\nconcerned with: the learning activity path (increased\nengagement with learning, including literacy and other\nfoundation subjects, and more efficient ways to manage\ntheir learning); the technical path (ease of use of the mobile\ndevices and facilities); the political path (increased interest\nand engagement about learning with parents); and the\ncultural path (increases in the range of places and times\nwhen learning was recognized and happening, provision of\nadditional learning opportunities and ways that learning\nwas developed, a more positive linking of learning outside\nand within the school, and increased levels of social\ninteraction and forms of communication).\nIt was clear that there had been important outcomes for\npupils as a whole, but that different pupils had gained in\ndifferent ways. For example, one child used the device to\nPASSEY: MOBILE LEARNING IN SCHOOL CONTEXTS: CAN TEACHERS ALONE MAKE IT HAPPEN? 77\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

The device offered him\nease of access to review his learning. The implementation\nwas sensitive to individual needs and concerns, supporting\npaths concerned with learning activity (at an individual\nlevel), political (of value to the individual), and cultural\n(allowing individual interests to be supported but providing\nfor involvement within a wider learning network system).\nWhile specific impacts were reported, wide impacts at a\nsocial networking level were recognizable in some cases\nalso. One teacher reported on the year group that she had\ntaught for the past three years, on a change in their attitude\nto learning during this project year\u2014particularly of the\nweakest pupils. She found that they were more positive and\nengaged more readily. Another teacher reported that pupils\nwith special educational needs felt more a part of the\nactivities\u2014they could write and do literacy more easily.\nTeachers felt that pupils after some six months of use\nregarded the mobile device as a tool like many others\u2014it\nwas something they could choose to use when and as\nappropriate. Observations in lessons indicated that pupils\nused the mobile devices in balance with other media\n(including paper), that they used them to support indepen-\ndent learning, andwithin an environment where approaches\noffered levels of flexibility to individual access and use.\nEvidence from this case study indicates the need for\npositive development of high levels of cultural acceptance\nand commitment across the systemic arena (the formal and\ninformal, home and school learning context). It also\nindicates that the systemic approach adopted recognizes\nthat individuals have important roles to play, but that the\nways in which these individual components build into a\nwider systemic approach also need to be accommodated.\n7 A SYSTEMIC IMPLEMENTATION MODEL FOR\nMOBILE TECHNOLOGIES\nThe importance of understanding the relationship among\nlearner, teacher, and parent or caregiver, if mobile\ntechnologies are to be implemented successfully, is high-\nlighted by Winters [28] in the Kaleidoscope Report, for\nexample. In the case study examples in this paper, mobile\ntechnologies have been used routinely, outcomes for\nlearners have been enhanced through home supported\nuse, and their appropriate application has been supported\nby committed teachers and encouraged through project or\nLA consultants. Using a modification of the Corbett and\nRossman [23] implementation paths model, different factors\ninfluencing implementation can be identified and examined\nfor each stakeholder or \u201cactor.\u201d It is clear from evidence\nabout implementation involving this range of stakeholders\nor \u201cactors\u201d that political and cultural factors are involved in\nsuccessful implementation just as much as technical or\nlearning activity factors.\nThe adoption of mobile technologies for learning is\nsubstantially different from the adoption of other school-\nbased technologies. Mobile technologies travel; they go\nhome and outside school, so the technology interacts\ndirectly with a number of \u201cactors\u201d as do the resources and\nmaterials on the technologies at times and places chosen by\nthe learner. Although many homes have computers and\nInternet access, fewer have mobile technologies (laptops,\nPDAs, or other devices such as smartphones). As mobile\ndevices move with the learners, ownership tends to be much\nmore firmly established with the individual. Although uses\nof mobile technologies may be shared with others at home,\ntheir movement with the user means that ownership resides\nwith the learner, rather than with the teacher, the school, the\nparent, or the family. The focus of use, therefore, needs to be\nwith the individual learner. Implementation practices need,\ntherefore, to look at the roles of the other stakeholders, but to\nplace the learner in a central implementation position rather\nthan the school or teacher as implementer. The roles that\nteachers take in supporting mobile technologies in class-\nrooms are not the same as the roles taken in supporting\nnonmobile technologies, and indeed, it has been recognized\nthat some schools and teachers restrict uses of mobile\ntechnologies and that it could be argued that this has been\ndone in order to ensure that the roles remain as they have\nbeen. The roles of the schools, and the roles of the parents\nand family members or friends are not the same. Although\nthe relationship between individual stakeholders and\nbetween paths within the wider systemic approach is\nclearly important, it is also important that individual\nstakeholders can recognize how they need to contribute to\nthe paths to enable a wider implementation picture to be\nsuccessful. The roles and activities of individual stake-\nholders (pupils, teachers, school managers, project consul-\ntants, and parents) in terms of each implementation path\nwill be summarized in this section.\nImplementation of the learning activity path is central to\nsuccess. It can make the difference between involvement of\npupils in learning activities that replace those activities\nalready runningwithin classrooms andpupil involvement in\nactivities that benefit them not only from a focus on learning\naspects that are difficult to support through other media, but\nalso benefit from potentially wider involvement with peers,\nparents, and carers.At this stage of national and international\nmobile learning development, useful and effective examples\nof learning activity practice are recognized. Making these\nactivities accessible could support those who might include\nthem in their planning and implementation patterns. There is\nneed for a range of different learning activities to support\nlearners, teachers, and parents at different stages of im-\nplementation, starting with those that account for the skills\nand capabilities of all the stakeholders at early stages,moving\nthrough to later activities that rely upon wider and deeper\noperational and learning skills. Factors contributing to\nsuccess within this path are the following:\n. For the head teacher\u2014recognizing the learning\npotential of the devices; providing opportunities\nfor discussion, reflection, and monitoring.\n. For teachers\u2014identifying and selecting appropriate\nlearning activities; supporting activities focusing on\nimportant aspects of learning; allowing and mediat-\ning the development of activities focusing on social,\nmetacognitive, and megacognitive aspects of learn-\ning; involving parents on a regular basis with\nlearning activities; gaining feedback about impacts\nand successes of learning activities; providing pupils\nwith opportunities to exercise increasing indepen-\ndence as to when and where to use devices inside\n78 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES, VOL. 3, NO. 1, JANUARY-MARCH 2010\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

For parents\u2014being willing to be involved in\nsupporting learning activities with children; mon-\nitoring how devices are being used and whether\nimpacts can be recognized; supporting appropriate\nsocial as well as educational uses of devices.\n. For a project or LA consultant\u2014providing effective\nlearning activity exemplars.\n. For pupils\u2014being willing to explore learning activ-\nities using devices; being willing to explore uses of\ndevices inside and outside the school.\nEvidence from the case studies indicates that the\ntechnical path is important for successful implementation.\nIndeed, while some schools have levels of internal support\nfor desktop computer systems, network and server infra-\nstructure systems, and for internal wireless systems, fewer\nreport having internal support with specific experience or\nexpertise in the area of mobile systems. Some LAs find the\nprovision of this support to be a challenging area. Factors\ncontributing to success within this path are the following:\n. For the head teacher\u2014gaining advice on usability\nand usefulness of specific devices; enabling technical\nsupport; ensuring a range of resources on devices,\nincluding Internet access, to allow important learn-\ning activities to be undertaken.\n. For teachers\u2014offering plans to manage the opera-\ntion of devices and how pupils and parents will\nmaintain these; providing opportunities for pupils to\ndevelop technical and operational skills at the same\ntime when undertaking selected learning activities;\nproviding opportunities for pupils to share their\ntechnical knowledge with others.\n. For parents\u2014gaining awareness of how to maintain\nand manage the operation of the devices; being\naware of technical routes to follow if required.\n. For a project or LA consultant\u2014providing technical\nsupport or advice regularly; maintaining Internet\naccess inside and (where possible) outside the\nschool; providing facilities that allow pupils and\nteachers to keep and share resources; providing\nopportunities for pupils and teachers to engage with\nothers in other schools.\n. For pupils\u2014gaining technical and operational skills\nwhile undertaking learning activities; seeking quali-\nfications to demonstrate technical and operational\nskills; sharing skills willingly with others.\nEvidence from case studies indicates that accommoda-\ntion of the political path can determine implementation\npatterns as well as levels of success. When planning an\nimplementation, head teachers or LA consultants find that\nthey need to recognize and match interests and aspirations\nof parents as well as pupils. They can find that there is\n\u201ctimeliness\u201d to implementation action; some parents may\nbe resistant to ideas of mobile learning at certain times,\nwhile at others, they are less resistant. The role of evidence\nto support implementation is found by some head teachers\nto be important to some parent groups, while other parent\ngroups wish to take on board concepts of leading\ninnovatory initiatives (Rogers\u2019 model [17] appears to apply\nhere to parent groups as much as to teachers). Factors\ncontributing to success within this path are the following:\n. For the head teacher\u2014being willing to take a\npositive lead; involving parents in \u201cbuy-in\u201d; accom-\nmodating the likelihood of shifting concerns by\ndifferent parties; building in the legitimacy of\nundertaking activities with mobile devices for all\nparties; accounting for an impact dip if this arises.\n. For teachers\u2014being willing to tell pupils that they\ncan use mobile devices as they wish even in lessons;\nintroducing mechanisms to allow pupils to support\neach other; capturing important uses and outcomes\nto share them with others.\n. For parents\u2014being willing to accept that mobile\ndevices are legitimate resources to support a range\nof important learning activities.\n. For a project or LA consultant\u2014being aware of and\noffering ways to support a system involving tea-\nchers, parents, and pupils.\n. For pupils\u2014being willing to explore different\nfeatures offered by the devices knowing that this\nis legitimate.\nAccommodating the cultural path is vitally important in\nthe implementation of mobile learning initiatives. This path\ncan determine not only the levels of involvement of\nstakeholders but also the quality of learning experiences.\nIt is recognized that parents can influence learning, either\npositively or negatively (see, for example, the findings and\ndiscussion offered by Henderson and Mapp [29] and\nWolfendale [30]). Mobile learning provides opportunities\nto involve parents positively; mobility and access mean that\nparents can be involved when and where opportunity and\nquestions arise. Supporting and involving this dimension,\nworking toward practices that account for these elements,\ncould well help to shape more easily a learning system that\nenables young people to interact across and between a\nrange of informal and formal elements (at home, in a\nmuseum, in the garden, in the classroom, in the play-\nground, in the car, on the beach), and to make and take\ndecisions about learning appropriateness at the times when\nopportunities arise or emerge. Factors contributing to\nsuccess within this path are the following:\n. For the head teacher\u2014providing ways for all parties\nto gain ownership of learning involvement; invol-\nving parents and pupils in learning endeavor;\nmanaging parental expectations; enabling regular\ndiscussions with parents, teachers, and pupils.\n. For teachers\u2014managing pupil expectations; provid-\ning regular learning opportunities that are home-\nand out-of-school-based; celebrating successes and\nallowing pupils to gain qualifications; providing for\nthe sharing of ideas and how individual pupils have\nused the devices.\n. For parents\u2014being willing to purchase or part-\npurchase devices; accepting involvement in educa-\ntional and learning practices; allowing children to\nuse devices as they see fit.\n.

For pupils\u2014developing capabilities enhancing inde-\npendence of action and engagement with learning;\nexercising judgment about choice of approaches and\nmedia to suit learning needs.\nIn some cases observed, early implementation has\nfocused on selected learning activities, often involving a\nlimited range of the full resources, such as a spelling test\nfacility. However, it is clear that a diversification of learning\nactivities is feasible within a year from the outset. Research\nfocusing on the progressive nature of implementation\npractices might be a worthwhile endeavor for the future.\nCertainly, continued research would provide opportunity\nto identify important features of a developing home-school\ndimension, to consider more the importance of certain\npolitical and cultural factors as implementations and time\nprogress, and to offer recommendations for longer term and\nwider parental involvement.\nThe framework proposed does not attempt to provide a\n\u201cblueprint\u201d for schools. As cautioned by Hartnell-Young\n[31], there is a need for schools to consider their\nindividualistic needs according to a range of cultural and\npolitical factors. The framework proposed does, however,\nprovide overall guidelines that schools should consider for\nimplementation. Schools successfully managing implement-\ning mobile technologies and gaining positive learning\noutcomes have placed the learning activity path central to\nthe implementation endeavor, but it is clear that elements of\nthe other three paths can determine aspects of quality and\ndepth of the learning experiences and impacts arising.\nSchool development plans can play a key role in respect to\nspecific contexts (see MacGilchrist and Mortimer [32]), since\nschool development plans provide an opportunity for\nschools to consider and take into account individualistic\ncultural and political circumstances. For example, schools\nare likely to want to handle \u201cbuy in\u201d in specific ways; some\nmight want to encourage entire financial commitment from\nparents, while others might want to support part-payment.\nSimilarly, some schools might want to involve specific\nclasses in a first year implementation, while other schools\nmight want to involve whole year groups. Some schools\nmight want to run awareness-raising sessions for parents in\nthe evenings, while other schools might want to ask parents\nto join their children in classes during the main school day.\n8 CONCLUSION\nThe framework offered in this paper proposes that\nimplementation of mobile technologies considers four\nparallel paths (learning activity, technical, political, and\ncultural), all being important at all stages of implementa-\ntion, with a central focus on learning activity. This frame-\nwork proposes the importance of involving and\naccommodating cultural and political factors from the\noutset of implementation, rather than at later stages of\nimplementation. Indeed, the evidence indicates that be-\ncause of differences between the nature of mobile technol-\nogies and the nature of desktop computers, a failure to\naccommodate political and cultural factors from the outset\nis likely to substantially limit involvement of important\nlearning activities. If these aspects are not considered from\nthe outset, certain measurable and identifiable impacts\n(concerned with parental awareness and involvement, and\nwith individual pupil support, for example) are likely to be\nsubstantially reduced (or eliminated). Mobile technologies\nhave the potential to impact in some key areas of learning,\nbut teachers alone will be unlikely to bring about the width\nof implementation needed. Implementation of mobile\ntechnologies is a case where systemic change and imple-\nmentation need to be recognized, key \u201cactors\u201d need to be\ninvolved, and implementation factors important to each\nstakeholder group need to be accommodated.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe author thanks the pupils, teachers, head teachers,\nproject and LA consultants, and parents in the Aston Pride\nNew Deals for Communities REAL Project, Normanby\nPrimary School, and Birmingham, Wolverhampton, and\nRedcar and Cleveland Local Authorities for their will-\ningness to contribute to the research reported in this paper.\nREFERENCES\n[1] J.
