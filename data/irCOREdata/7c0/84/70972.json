In producing a word, there is a variety\nof types of information available to a speaker as well as these grammatical constraints,\nincluding conceptual information about the referent of the word, such as its concep-\ntual number, animacy, and biological gender, as well as phonological information.\nThere are debates about how much these types of information interact in the\nproduction of a word, in other words whether the conceptual and phonological infor-\nmation is available to a speaker when selecting the grammatical form of a word. These\nhave been reviewed by Vigliocco & Hartsuiker (2002). There is much evidence, both\nfrom psycholinguistic experiments and from spontaneous speech errors, for the inter-\nplay of grammatical with conceptual information, including interactions between\ngrammatical and conceptual number (Eberhard, 1997; Vigliocco, Butterworth, &\nSemenza, 1995), grammatical and conceptual \/ biological gender (Vigliocco & Franck,\n1999; Vigliocco & Franck, 2001), and grammatical form and semantic properties\n(Ramscar, 2002).\nHowever there is less evidence for interaction between grammatical form and\nphonological form. Bock & Eberhard (1993) carried out an experiment in which\nsubjects heard phrases consisting of a singular head noun with a plural or singular\nnoun in a following prepositional phrase, for example:\nThe player on the court\nThe player on the courts\nSubjects were asked to complete the sentence in any way they wished, but a\ncorrect completion was scored if the sentence\u2019s verb immediately followed the second\nnoun. As in previous experiments, an excess of agreement errors was found when the\nsecond noun \u2014 spoken just before the verb of the sentence \u2014 was plural. However\nno excess of agreement errors was found in a third condition where the second noun\nin the phrase that was heard ended in \/ s \/, and was designed to mimic a plural (a\npseudoplural), for example\nThe player on the course\nHowever as Bock & Eberhard themselves note, these types of pseudoplurals are\nnot true pseudoplurals as they do not conform to standard English morphophone-\nmics, where plurals have final \/ s \/ when preceded by unvoiced consonant, but final\n\/z \/ when as in this case it is preceded by \/ r \/ or a vowel.\nA second experiment used homophones (e.g., tax \/ tacks) presented visually, where\none of the pair is a true plural and the other is a nonplural noun. Again agreement\nerrors only occurred following true plural nouns. However it is possible that the visual\npresentation and \/ or the homophonic nature of the items may have affected this.\nLanguage and Speech\n2 Kiswahili noun class processing\nA similar experiment in Italian, in contrast (Vigliocco, Butterworth, & Semenza,\n1995), using head nouns that have the same morphophonemics in singular and plural,\ndid find an increase in verb errors following these nouns.\nIn addition, work with nonfluent aphasic subjects suggests that it is the phonology\nof regular past tenses that make them difficult to process by such subjects, again\nsuggesting that grammatical information is reliant on phonological information (Bird,\nRalph, Seidenberg, McClelland, & Patterson, 2003).\nHence evidence from the speech production system suggests that there is suffi-\ncient interaction between the various different types of information described above\nto cause serious trouble for a modular account of speech production, in which different\nsystems do not interact. Further evidence for the interaction of phonological and\ngrammatical information would add weight to the integrationist arguments.\nModularity of the grammatical system has also been argued for when examining\nthe difference between regular and irregular grammatical agreements, such as the case\nof plurals in English (Pinker, 2000). It is argued that processing of regular plurals, for\nexample, proceeds according to a set of rules learned by a child while acquiring their\nlanguage, whereas irregular plurals are learnt on a word-by-word basis, and this different\nprocessing accounts for the different behavior of these types of plurals in some exper-\nimental situations. For example, children and adults will reject as ungrammatical\ncompound phrases containing regular plurals such as rats-eater but will accept similar\ncompound phrases containing irregular plurals such as mice-eater.\nHowever if phonology and grammar do interact, then this data is explicable by\nreference to the phonology of the words. Seidenberg, Haskell, & MacDonald (1999)\nsuggest that the difference between English regular and irregular plurals is not that\nirregular plurals are looked up in the lexicon while regular plurals are formed on a\ncase-by-case basis using rules; rather the difference is that regular plurals have plural\nmorphology while irregular plurals do not. There are some semiregularities in irreg-\nular plurals (e.g., ox \u2014 oxen; child \u2014 children; knife \u2014 knives; wife \u2014 wives) but only\nsome of these semiregular plurals have plural morphology (knives, wives). Seidenberg\net al. (1999) found that these semiregular plurals with plural morphology were, in\ncommon with regular plurals, less likely to be accepted as part of well-formed\ncompounds, for example:\nmouse-eater 1\nrat-eater \nwolf-eater \nmice-eater\n*rats-eater\n*wolves-eater\nLanguage and Speech\nK. J. Alcock and D. Ngorosho 3\n1 Although both \u2018mouse\u2019 and \u2018rats\u2019 end in \/s \/ only \u2018rats\u2019 has plural phonology since plurals\nwith a penultimate vowel must end in \/ z \/. Final \/ s \/ is not sufficient or necessary for a\nword to have plural phonology: \u2018rows\u2019 does not end in \/s \/ but has regular plural morphology.\n\u2014 where those compounds marked * are less acceptable. This suggests that the plural\nmorphology\u2014not the regularity of the plural, and its possible formation using rules\u2014\nis the crucial feature in determining whether it can form an acceptable compound noun,\nand similarly in whether it might behave like a \u201cregular\u201d plural.\nIt seems fruitful therefore to carry out further investigations into the interaction\nbetween phonology and grammatical agreement, especially in speech production. In\nEnglish few words and constructions require morphophonemic marking of gram-\nmatical agreement, and in many other European languages there are few ambiguous\nsituations where one phonological realization could potentially stand for more than\none grammatical entity. However there are some non-European languages whose\nmorphophonemic structure lends them more to this type of study, including the\nlanguage used in this study, Kiswahili.\nIn English, marking of noun and verb agreement only occurs for number, and\nonly the noun and the verb are marked. In other languages, however, marking can occur\nfor number, grammatical gender, and grammatical case, and the verb, adjective, and\nvarious pronouns can be marked. The grammatical gender system has been investi-\ngated in several European languages (Akhutina, Kurgansky, Polinsky, & Bates, 1999;\nBates, Devescovi, Hernandez, & Pizzamiglio, 1996; Bentrovato, Devescovi, D'Amico,\n& Bates, 1998).\n1.2\nOverview of grammatical gender\n\u201cGender\u201d is derived from a Latin word genus meaning \u2018type\u2019 and hence etymologi-\ncally does not necessarily refer to whether a referent is masculine or feminine. It is\ntherefore linguistically correct to refer to all such typological language systems as\n\u201cgender,\u201d whether or not male and female humans and animals are referred to by\nparticular genders. However, in the linguistics of Kiswahili, the language studied here,\nthese differing groups of words which form grammatical agreements are not usually\nreferred to as \u201cgenders\u201d but rather as \u201cnoun classes,\u201d and this convention will be used\nhere. In addition, as there is no male \/ female linguistic distinction in Kiswahili, the\nconventional use of \u201cgender\u201d to refer to male and female divisions might confuse the\nissue.\nThe noun class system found in Kiswahili and the gender systems found in many\nother languages share many features. By definition, a gender system is one in which\none word (e.g., an adjective or pronoun) must agree in gender or class, and often\nnumber and case as well, with a referent (which can be, e.g., a noun explicitly present\nin the sentence, or a person or object mentioned previously or alluded to). Some\nlanguages have only number agreement. The simplest form of gender agreement is found\nin English and some other languages, where only anaphoric pronouns must agree\nwith their referent. More complex systems involve adjective agreement, verb agree-\nment, agreements of specialized adjectives such as possessives and numbers, and even\nadverbs and complementizers.\nAlthough the principle of such systems \u2014 that some words in a sentence must\nagree with their referents in gender or noun class \u2014 is similar in all languages that have\ngender, the details, particularly of exactly how a word acquires gender, differ greatly\nLanguage and Speech\n4 Kiswahili noun class processing\nin different languages. Some languages appear to rely almost entirely on semantic or\n\u201cnatural\u201d gender, including English and some languages of the Indian subcontinent.\nHowever, in other languages such as French and German the allocation of words to\na particular gender can appear almost random to the casual observer.\nThis apparent randomness is deceptive, however, and on closer examination\nphonological and morphological regularities are found even in systems that appear\nrelatively opaque. As described below, the noun class system that exists in Kiswahili\nis somewhat less opaque than many other languages but it is not always completely\npredictable. However, native speakers seem to be able to assign noun classes consis-\ntently and easily, as in other languages with gender.\nHow then do native speakers of such languages assign gender, and what might\naffect this? In many languages, regularities of the phonological and morphological\nfeatures of a word can act as a guide to the gender of a word, but they are not always\na perfect indication of gender. This makes the grammatical gender system appro-\npriate for the study of the interaction of phonological and grammatical processing.\nIn some other languages, the semantics of a word is a very good guide to gender;\nin languages where both semantics and phonological form are important, there is\nsome suggestion that semantics takes precedence in forming agreement (Corbett,\n1991). This is also relevant to Kiswahili, as there are both morphological and semantic\ncharacteristics of a word that can determine its agreements. A short description of the\ngrammatical structure of the language is in order.\n1.3\nIntroduction to Kiswahili\nKiswahili is a language of the Bantu group which is spoken as a first or primary\nlanguage in coastal and island areas of Tanzania and Kenya, and urban inland areas\nof Tanzania, and used as a trade language or a language of education throughout these\ncountries, and in other areas of East Africa including Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi\nand areas of Zaire.\nHistorically, the status of Kiswahili as a coastal and trade language has meant\nthat it incorporates a large number of borrowed words. Many of the loan words are\nderived from Arabic, and this was the original source of loan words. However, the gram-\nmatical characteristics of these words are strictly Bantu in character.\nAs with other Bantu languages, Kiswahili has a richly inflected grammatical\nnoun class system. Noun classes are similar in structure and function to grammatical\ngenders except that there are more of them and their semantic properties do not\ninclude biological gender. Noun classes are inflected by means of prefixes and, in the\ncase of demonstratives and relative pronouns, infixes, though the latter were not used\nin this experiment.\nGenerally the singular and the plural of a noun class are counted as separate noun\nclasses. This is partly for historical reasons, but also in an attempt to coordinate the\nlabeling of noun classes across different languages, and a reflection of the fact that\nmost, but by no means all, nouns in a particular noun class will form their plurals in\nthe corresponding plural class.\nLanguage and Speech\nK. J. Alcock and D. Ngorosho 5\nThis labeling system, a numeric system, is consistent across languages, and since\nsome languages have either lost or never had some noun classes, this means that there\nare gaps in the numbering in many languages, including Kiswahili. The classes that\nare present in Kiswahili are shown in Table 1. For each noun the hyphen indicates the\ndivision between the prefix and the noun root, and is not present in normal Kiswahili\nspelling or pronunciation.\nTABLE 1 \nNoun classes present in Kiswahili\nClass Example Meaning\n1 m-toto child\n2 wa-toto children\n3 m-lango door\n4 mi-lango doors\n5 embe mango\n6 ma-embe mangoes\n7 ki-tanda bed\n8 vi-tanda beds\n9 ny-umba house\n10 ny-umba houses\n11 u-zi thread\n14 u-zuri beauty\nMost nouns in Classes 11 and 14 are uncountable or abstract and hence do not\nregularly form plurals; however, where there are plurals, they are formed in Class 10.\nThe prefixes of Class 11 and 14 have the same surface form, and are sometimes\ncombined into Class 11 \/ 14; however, Class 14 contains mainly abstract nouns while\nClass 11 contains concrete but largely uncountable items. There are an additional\nfour classes of derived nouns, three of which are locatives and one of which is a class\nof infinitive verbs.\nThere appear to be some semantic commonalties in words in each of the classes;\nsome such generalizations are stronger than others (Contini-Morava, 1996; Zawawi,\n1979). There is some evidence for the reality of semantic generalizations, including\nthe fact that where a speaker desires to change the meaning of a word slightly, the word\nis often altered phonologically to place it in a different noun class. However, there is\nalso some evidence against semantic generalizations for noun classes, including the\nfact that loan words are generally placed in the noun class that fits their phonolog-\nical form, rather than the class that might fit their semantic characteristics. This has\nalso been found in related Bantu languages (Demuth, 2000).\nLanguage and Speech\n6 Kiswahili noun class processing\nAgreements. In each noun class all of the following must agree with the noun: prefixes\non adjectives, including some numbers; possessive pronouns, including the word \u2018of\u2019;\nthe subject prefix on verbs (including all verbs of action and the verb kuwepo, \u2018to be\nin a place or state\u2019, and the verb kuwa \u2018to be\u2019 in the past tense but not this one verb\nin the present tense); the prefixes and infixes on demonstratives; and the object pronoun\nand relative pronoun infixes on verbs. Examples of each type of agreement can be seen\nin the Appendix.\nThe noun obligatorily precedes adjectives, numbers and possessive pronouns.\nVerbs and demonstratives frequently precede the noun for topicalization or emphasis,\nalthough the basic word order in Kiswahili is SVO. Agreements on adjectives are the\nsame as on nouns in all cases except Class 11 \/14. Agreements on other classes are semi-\nregular. The prefixes on nouns and agreements for all classes with the verb kuwepo\n(\u2018to be in a place\u2019, the prime used in this experiment) are shown in Table 2.\nTABLE 2 \nNoun class agreements with the primes used in the experiment\nNoun class Prefix on noun \u2018To be in a place\u2019\n1 m- (mw- before vowel)\nor \u00d8 yupo\n2 wa- wapo\n3 m- (mw- before vowel) upo\n4 mi- ipo\n5 \u00d8 or j- lipo\n6 ma- yapo\n7 ki- (ch- before vowel) kipo\n8 vi (vy- before vowel) vipo\n9 nasal consonant (notated N) or \u00d8 ipo\n10 nasal consonant (N) or \u00d8 zipo\n11 \/ 14 u- upo\nAtypical, flexible, irregular, and unprefixed nouns. The noun class system is not as\nrigid as has been implied. Some nouns regularly form agreements in one noun class\nalthough their prefixes imply they should be placed in another class. This is prima-\nrily true of animate nouns. In fact, the definition of gender (Corbett, 1991) is a group\nof nouns which all take the same agreements, rather than a group that share morpho-\nphonemic or semantic characteristics.\nMost nouns referring to people and many referring to animals have the regular\nClass 1 \/ 2 m-\/wa- prefix. However, many nouns referring to people and the majority\nreferring to animals do not have these prefixes (such as fundi, \u2018craftsperson\u2019, or simba,\n\u2018lion\u2019). Generally these nouns pluralize in either Class 5 \/ 6 (mafundi, \u2018craftspeople\u2019),\nor Class 9 \/ 10 (simba, \u2018lions\u2019). These nouns must still take all prefixes in Classes 1 \/ 2\nas they are animate. Hence we have:\nLanguage and Speech\nK. J. Alcock and D. Ngorosho 7\nfundi yupo the craftsperson is here\nfundi yu- po\ncraftsperson Class 1 prefix to be in a place\nsimba wapo the lions are here\nsimba wa- po\nlions Class 2 prefix to be in a place\nNeither of the above nouns have a Class 1 \/ 2 prefix but both take Class 1 \/ 2\nagreements, and hence are grammatically placed in Class 1 \/ 2.\nNote also that it is possible for the regular prefix for nouns in different classes\nto be phonologically the same. Classes 1 and 3 share a prefix, while some nouns in\nClass 1 and the majority of nouns in Class 9 share their lack of prefix. For Classes 1\nand 3, the regular prefix is m- . Some agreements are the same for both classes, and\nsome are not. For example:\nmtoto mzuri \u2018good child\u2019\nm- toto m- zuri\nClass 1 noun prefix child Class 1 adjective prefix good\nmlango mzuri \u2018good door\u2019\nm- lango m- zuri\nClass 3 noun prefix door Class 3 adjective prefix good\nHowever:\nmtoto analia \u2018the child cries\u2019\nm- toto a- na- lia\nClass 1        noun child Class 1    verb present tense cry\nprefix prefix marker\nmlango unalia \u2018the door squeaks\u2019\nm- lango u- na- lia\nClass 3        noun door Class 3    verb present   tense make noise\nprefix prefix marker\nThe above characteristics of the language \u2014 rigid and wide-ranging grammat-\nical agreements, together with reasonably straightforward but less than 100% one-to-one\ncorrespondence between phonological form and grammatical noun class \u2014 mean that\nKiswahili is ideally suited to the study of the interaction between phonological form\nand grammatical agreement in speech production. In particular, the sharing of phono-\nlogical form between the prefixes of more than one grammatical noun class (Class 1\nprefixed and Class 3; and also between Class 1 unprefixed and Class 5 [ not used here ]\nand Class 9), means that it is suitable for the investigation of pseudopriming, similar\nto the pseudoplural agreements investigated by Bock & Eberhard (1993).\n1.4\nExperimental design and hypotheses\nThis richly inflected noun class system provides a framework for a study of the\nLanguage and Speech\n8 Kiswahili noun class processing\nproduction of grammatical agreements. In particular, we can investigate gender\nagreements in a language that has a relatively transparent agreement system, and\nwhich has more than the two or three genders which are found in European languages.\nA simple and reliable method of doing this is grammatical priming of picture naming.\nThis method also has the advantage of ecological validity when working with a fairly\nexperimentally na\u00efve population.\nHistorically in the study of speech production early studies of a particular\nphenomenon have examined spontaneous speech errors either qualitatively or quan-\ntitatively (Vigliocco & Hartsuiker, 2002). The experimental induction of speech errors\nis also a frequently used method. However grammatical priming is increasingly seen\nas a helpful means of studying the components of grammatical agreement.\nGrammatical priming involves the presentation of a grammatically concordant\nor nonconcordant (either discordant, or neutral) stimulus prior to the presentation\nof the target. This can involve either visual presentation of a picture or a word, or\nauditory presentation of a word. It can be used to investigate number agreement\n(Gillon, Kehayia, & Taler, 1999; Liu, Chiarello, & Quan, 1999), grammatical case\n(Gurjanov, 1985), grammatical gender (Wicha, Bates, Hernandez, Reyes, & Galvadon\nde Barreto, 1997; Bates et al., 1996), or even the grammatical structure of the sentence\n(Bock, 1986).\nWe can thereby study the effects of agreement on speech processing; and in addi-\ntion we can investigate the effects of the presence of a prime on single word production;\nwe can vary the agreement of the primes, having nouns, adjectives and primes that either\nagree (are grammatically correct) or do not agree (are grammatically incorrect) with\nthe noun to be processed. There are also possibilities for neutral primes, as some types\nof words, for example imperative verbs, are not marked for noun class.\nBriefly, therefore, subjects hear a grammatically correct, grammatically incorrect,\nor neutral prime, followed by a picture. Subjects are required to say the name of the\npicture, and their naming is timed.\nAs well as examining the effects of straightforward noun class prefixes, the pres-\nence of unmarked or \u201cirregular\u201d nouns can be used to investigate the effects of noun\nclasses with and without prefixes. As seen above, some nouns that take Class 1 \/ 2\nagreements can be unmarked, as well as most nouns in Class 5 and many nouns in\nClass 9 \/ 10. There are a few nouns in Class 5 that are marked with a prefix (ji-) but\nas this is a rare prefix, Class 5 \/ 6 was excluded. Class 11 \/ 14 consists of abstract and\nuncountable nouns that are therefore not easily depictable, and this was also excluded;\nand plurals were excluded to simplify the study.\nHence the final design includes singular nouns from Class 1, Class 3, Class 7,\nand Class 9. Nouns from Class 1 and Class 9 included both those with a regular prefix\nand those without; and nouns from Class 3 and Class 7 all have a regular prefix. In\nClass 9 the regular prefix is a nasal consonant which varies depending on the following\nconsonant or vowel. In some contexts the prefix can be \/m \/; as this is the same as the\nprefix in Class 1 (or nearly the same, as it is not syllabic whereas the Class 1 prefix is\nsyllabic), such words were excluded, and the \u201cregular\u201d prefix for Class 9 was taken\nto be nasals (notated N) spelled as n \u2014 (these are \/n \/, \/\u014b \/ and \/\u0002 \/).\nLanguage and Speech\nK. J. Alcock and D. Ngorosho 9\nIt is hypothesized that if production of noun class agreement depends solely on\ngrammatical processes, then production of nouns should only be primed by those\nprimes that are grammatically concordant with the name of the picture. In other\nwords, Class 1 nouns should be primed by the grammatically correct prime for that\nclass, and Class 3, 7, and 9 words likewise.\nAlternatively however it can be hypothesized that the phonological form of the\nprefix and \/ or its frequency play a role and hence there may be different priming\neffects for different classes. In particular, the common phonological form shared by\nthe prefixes of some Class 1 nouns and all Class 3 nouns (the m- prefix) may cause\nsome cross-priming between these two classes; and the common phonological form\nshared by other Class 1 nouns and most Class 9 nouns (a null prefix) may also lead\nto cross-priming. There are also different type frequencies for different noun classes\nand this may also be relevant. The experimental design can be illustrated in Table 3:\nTABLE 3 \nExperimental design\nFirst subject hears one of: Then Then \nsubject subject \nNoun Number Correct Incorrect \u201cPseudoprime\u201d Neutral sees says\nclass of (concordant) (discordant) prime picture name of\nwords prime prime e.g. of: picture:\n1 9 yupo kipo upo sema baby mtoto\n(prefixed) (\u2018say\u2019)\n1 9 yupo kipo ipo sema lion simba\n(unprefixed) (\u2018say\u2019)\n3 18 upo kipo yupo sema belt mkanda\n(\u2018say\u2019)\n7 18 kipo yupo \u2013 sema chair kitanda\n(\u2018say\u2019)\n9 9 ipo upo \u2013 sema hammer nyundo\n(prefixed) (\u2018say\u2019)\n9 9 ipo kipo \u2013 sema phone simu\n(unprefixed) (\u2018say\u2019)\nThere may be some confounding factors, which will be controlled for. As Kiswahili\nis not a very well-described language it can be difficult to determine the extent to\nwhich formal grammatical agreement corresponds to grammatical agreement as used\nin practice. Any interactions between grammatical processing and other processes in\nspeech production might then be due to the mismatch between the \u201ccorrect\u201d agree-\nment (derived from grammatical texts, e.g., Ashton, 1966, and used as part of school\ninstruction) as assumed by the experimental design, and the actual grammatical agree-\nment as used by native speakers.\nThis can be controlled for in two ways. The first is to obtain off-line grammat-\nLanguage and Speech\n10 Kiswahili noun class processing\nicality judgments from native speakers. The second is to vary the demographics of the\nsubjects so that some subjects have current exposure to the maximum amount of\ngrammatical instruction that is available in the society. Children in the later stages of\nprimary schooling form this group in this society \u2014 their grammatical instruction is\nongoing and they have had several years of this, and hence if their processing is closer\nto the \u201ccorrect\u201d processing than that of adults who have not recently been exposed\nto such instruction, this would suggest that any interactions found in the adult popu-\nlation are because of a mismatch between \u201ccorrect\u201d and actual grammatical agreement.\nHence in summary we have two alternative hypotheses as follows:\n1. If there is no interaction between grammatical agreement processing and other\nforms of linguistic information, especially phonological information, then produc-\ntion of nouns should be primed by a verb that agrees grammatically with the noun,\nand not by any other verb.\n2. If however there are \u201cleaky joints\u201d (Vigliocco & Hartsuiker, 2002) between\nphonological and grammatical agreement systems, then production of a noun\nin a class whose prefix shares a phonological form with another class could be\nprimed by not only the verb that agrees with its own class but also by the verb\nthat agrees with the other class.\n2Methods\n2.1\nParticipants\nParticipants were 67 native speakers of Kiswahili, residents of Bagamoyo, Tanzania,\nof whom 29 were over 20 years of age (mean age 22.2 years, SD 3.65) and 38 were\nbetween the ages of 12 and 17 (mean age 14.3, SD 1.48); the latter were all students\nin the fifth through seventh grade in a primary school in the study area. This is a\ncommon age range for primary school students in the study area. Of the adults, 10\nwere female; of the primary school students, 19 were female. All participants spoke\nKiswahili as their first and primary language. All of the children were learning English\nas a second language in school, and most of the adult participants had also attended\nprimary school including some instruction in English. However, no participants spoke\nanother Tanzanian language (many other Tanzanian languages have similar noun\nclass systems) and no participant had attended (English medium) secondary school.\nAdult participants were given a small monetary compensation for their time, and\nstudents were given a small educational gift such as a pen or exercise book. All partic-\nipants were tested by one of two members of the project whose primary language is\nKiswahili and who are familiar with the testing setup.\n2.2\nMaterials\u2014data on the nouns used\nDepictability and untimed grammaticality judgments. All of the nouns used were first\npretested in untimed naming and grammaticality judgment tasks. Many of the pictures\nused are part of the battery used by the International Picture Norming Study (Bates\net al., 2000). Suitable pictures were chosen and printed six to a page, and 10 local\nLanguage and Speech\nK. J. Alcock and D. Ngorosho 11\nparticipants (adults and children in the same age range as used in the study) were\nasked to name each picture. Pictures for which most participants provided the same\nname were retested with different participants. In the retest, participants were provided\nwith the most common name if they did not state it themselves, and then asked to name\nthe picture a second time following naming all the pictures once (50 to 60 pictures in\na session). Pictures were rejected if 80% agreement on the second naming was not\nreached.\nThe nouns chosen to be sufficiently depictable were then presented to partici-\npants from the same locality in untimed grammaticality judgments. A total of 20 adults\nand 20 schoolchildren of the same age and educational level as the participants in the\nmain study were asked to choose one possible agreement from two, or state that neither\nwas appropriate (in which case they were asked to provide an alternative). The verb\n\u2018to be in a place\u2019 was used, as this was the prime chosen for the experiment. Originally\ntwo choices of verb were given for each noun, the verb agreeing with that noun (as deter-\nmined by dictionary definition, Interterritorial Language (Swahili) Committee to the\nEast African Dependencies, 1956), and an alternative from any of the other classes used\nin the experiment, or the verb agreeing with Class 5, which was not used in this exper-\niment, but like Class 9 is unmarked in the singular for many nouns. Many nouns that\nthe dictionary places in Class 9 were judged as not agreeing with the Class 9 verb, but\nwith the Class 5 verb (or no verb given) by the participants.\nAll doubtful nouns and all nouns in Class 9 were then retested with another 20\nparticipants, using both the correct verb according to the dictionary and another\nrandomly chosen verb for non-Class-9 nouns, and both of the Class 9 and the Class 5\nverb for Class 9 nouns, as many theoretical Class 9 nouns were judged previously to\ntake agreements in Class 5. Some nouns were again chosen by a large minority of\nparticipants to be in Class 5, or at least to take Class 5 agreements, which is logically\nequivalent. Nouns that did not reach 90% agreement or higher were accepted. Nouns\nthat form irregular plurals were also excluded.\nType frequency. All of the nouns in the Kiswahili language were extracted from an\non-line dictionary, the Kamusi Project (Kamusi Project, 1999), and sorted by noun\nclass, with duplicate meanings eliminated. Of a total of 6719 nouns, the totals in each\nclass, with percentages of the total and of the class, are shown in Table 4. Bold figures\nindicate the total for each noun class.\nTABLE 4 \nType frequency of nouns in different noun classes\nClass Frequency Percentage of class Percentage of total\nAll animate nouns 973 14.48\n1 \/ 2 regular 600 61.66 8.93\nAnimate with plurals 252 25.90 3.75\nas Class 9 \/ 10\nAnimate with other 121 12.44 1.80\nLanguage and Speech\n12 Kiswahili noun class processing\nplural formation\n3 \/ 4 inanimate 722 10.75\n5 \/ 6 inanimate 1293 19.24\n7 \/ 8 inanimate 826 12.29\n9 \/ 10 inanimate total 1955 29.10\n9 \/ 10 inanimate 138 7.06 2.05\nwith nasal prefix\n9 \/ 10 inanimate 97 4.96 1.44\nwith nasal prefix\n9 \/ 10 inanimate 1817 92.94 27.04\nwithout nasal prefix\n11 \/ 14 950 14.14\nTotal 6719\n2.3\nProcedures\nThe primes and pictures were all presented using the PsyScope stimulus presentation\nenvironment on a Macintosh Powerbook computer using a pair of headphones with\nattached microphone for stimulus presentation and voice recording, and a Carnegie\nMellon button box for time recording (MacWhinney, Cohen, & Provost, 1997).\nParticipants were initially familiarized with the apparatus and then were presented\nwith the entire set of pictures to be used for practice and experimental sessions, with\nthe pictures shown on the screen and picture presentation time controlled by the\nexperimenter, to ensure that the subject could become familiar with the pictures and\napparatus without time pressure.\nParticipants were asked to name each picture and if the name given corresponded\nwith the target name, they were told \u201cyes, that\u2019s right.\u201d If the name given was not\nidentical to the target name but was semantically plausible, was in the same noun\nclass (took the same agreements) and had the same prefix, then the tester told the partic-\nipant \u201cYes, or it could be [ target name ].\u201d If the name given did not meet all of these\ncriteria, the participant was told \u201cNo, it\u2019s [ target name ].\u201d\nPictures used were 300 \u00d7 300 pixel black and white line drawings, taken from a\nnumber of corpora in use as part of the International Picture Norming Study (Bates\net al., 2000). Pictures had previously been tested for agreement in naming (see above).\nFollowing this, participants had a brief prepractice session where it was explained\nto them that they would hear a word before each picture was presented, and that they\nshould try to say the name of the picture as quickly as possible. Only two pictures were\nused in the prepractice session and each was presented with three different primes. The\nfirst prime was sema (\u2018say\u2019) and before this prime participants were told \u201cSometimes\nLanguage and Speech\nK. J. Alcock and D. Ngorosho 13\nyou will just hear sema before you see the picture\u201d; the next prime was a concordant\nprime (yupo, or other appropriate prime) and participants were told \u201cSometimes you\nwill hear a word that goes well with the name of the picture\u201d; and the last of the three\nprimes was a discordant prime (ipo, or other discordant prime) and participants were\ntold \u201cAnd sometimes you will hear a word that does not go with the picture. Just try\nto say the name of the picture as quickly as you can.\u201d For this session each of the two\npictures was presented three times in succession with the primes in the order described.\nA practice session with 24 pictures, corresponding to six nouns in each class,\nfollowed this. This took the same form as the test session but no picture was repeated.\nNouns were paired with either neutral (sema, \u2018say\u2019), concordant (the agreeing form\nof kuwepo, \u2018to be in a place\u2019) or discordant (one of the other three, nonagreeing forms\nof kuwepo) primes. Note that further forms exist in the language but were not used\nhere. The primes were heard first with a fixation point (a small cross) in the center of\nthe screen, and then at the prime offset the picture appeared. Participants were encour-\naged to fixate the cross and then to name the picture as quickly as possible following\nits appearance.\nThe test session consisted of 72 nouns, each presented three times; all 72 pictures\nwere presented in a random order, then again in a different random order, and then for\na third time in a third random order. The nouns used consisted of 18 nouns each from\nClasses 1, 3, 7 and 9. To recapitulate, these classes have the following characteristics:\nClass Prefix Example and gloss\nConcordant form of\nkuwepo\n1 m- or \u00d8 mwalimu teacher yupo\n3 m- mlango door upo\n7 ki- kisu knife kipo\n9 N- or \u00d8 * nyumba house ipo\n* where N indicates a nasal consonant\nHence some nouns in Class 1 or Class 9, that is to say forming agreements in\nClass 1 or Class 9, have prefixes, and some do not. Thus while all of the 18 nouns in\nClass 3 and all of the 18 nouns in Class 7 had prefixes, the nouns in Class 1 and\nClass 9 consisted of nine prefixed nouns in each class and nine unprefixed nouns in\neach class:\nClass No. of prefixed nouns No. of unprefixed nouns\n1 9 9\n3 18\n7 18\n9 9 9\nEach noun was randomly assigned to an order of prime presentation, with either\nneutral first, concordant first or discordant first; within each class and prefix group,\na third were assigned to each condition. As for each noun there were three possible\nLanguage and Speech\n14 Kiswahili noun class processing\ndiscordant primes (being all the concordant primes from the other classes), each noun\nin each class and prefix group was assigned one discordant prime, so that different\nnouns in each class appeared with the different discordant primes.\nParticipants\u2019 voice reaction times (from the onset of the picture) were recorded\nusing the internal clock of the button box; testers in addition recorded whether or not\nthe target word was given, and any hesitations or self corrections, as well as any alter-\nnative words given.\nTwo possible scoring criteria were then used, strict and lenient. In the strict\ncriteria only the target word given in the initial picture familiarization session was allowed\nas correct. In the more lenient criteria any word that was semantically plausible, in\nthe same noun class and with the same prefix was taken as correct. Participants also\nhad a tendency for within-word hesitations, for example when presented with a picture\nof a bed (kitanda) they might say ki \u2026 tanda. Under the lenient scoring criteria these\nwere also deemed correct; as long as the final word produced was semantically plau-\nsible and the first sound produced was its initial sound, and there were no sidetracks\nto semantically implausible, grammatically incorrect, or differently prefixed words in\nbetween. Data based on these two sets of scoring criteria were both used for the final\nanalyses (see below).\n3Results\n3.1\nAdults\nOverall summary and numbers correct. Overall, participants named 195.34 (SD = 15.00)\nof the 216 pictures correctly under the strict scoring scheme and 201.76 (SD = 9.65)\nof the pictures correctly under the lenient scoring system.\nThere was a significant difference in the number correct under the two different\nscoring systems, t (28) = 5.355, p < .001. However, there were no effects of noun class\nor type of prime on number correct, no matter how number correct was scored. In\nthe following analyses, number correct was therefore not analyzed; effects on reaction\ntime did not differ between strict and lenient scoring methods, and hence it was\ndecided to use the lenient scoring method in order to maximize the number of valid\ndata points.\nOne effect on numbers correct was significant: there was a significant interac-\ntion between scoring method and class, F (3, 26) = 5.53, p = .002. This can be seen in\nFigure 1. It is possible that this is due to slightly more variable naming in Class 1 \u2014\nnames for occupations, especially, may have more options than other types of names.\nHowever neither planned comparisons, nor further analysis classifying words into\npeople \/ nonpeople or animate (Class 1 nouns are all animate) \/ nonanimate revealed\nany significant results.\nLanguage and Speech\nK.

Hence the type of word heard before naming the picture\naffected the speed of picture naming.\nLanguage and Speech\n16 Kiswahili noun class processing\nFigure 1\nInteraction between noun class and scoring method (strict vs. lenient) \u2013 Adults.\nError bars \u00b1 1 SE in all charts \nFigure 2\nAnalysis of noun class and prime effects \u2013 Adults\nThere was also a significant interaction between prime and noun class, F (6, 23)\n= 2.714, p = .015 \u2014 this effect of prime was not the same for all noun classes.\nThese effects were then investigated further, as follows.\nPlanned comparisons revealed that participants were significantly faster to name\npictures when a concordant prime was presented than when a neutral prime was\npresented (mean difference = 28.442, SE = 10.665, p = .031). There was no difference\nbetween discordant primes and the two other types of prime. A concordant (gram-\nmatically agreeing) prime speeds picture naming up when compared to a neutral prime\n(\u2018say\u2019). A discordant (ungrammatical) prime does not slow picture naming down\ncompared to the neutral prime.\nWhen the different noun classes were compared, it was found that all pairs\ncompared were significantly different with p = .001 or less, apart from the compar-\nison between Classes 3 and 7, where there was no significant difference. Overall,\npictures in Class 1 (nouns with prefix m- or no prefix, that are animate) were named\nthe slowest, followed by Classes 3 (inanimate nouns with prefix m-) and 7 (prefix ki-),\nand Class 9 (nasal prefix or no prefix) was named the fastest.\nOne way ANOVA of each noun class revealed that in Classes 1 and 9 there was\nno effect of type of prime, the significant effect of prime occurring in Classes 3 (prefix\nm-) and 7 (prefix ki-), F (2, 27) = 3.365, p = .042 for Class 3 and F (2, 27) = 6.334,\np = .003 for Class 7. Hence there was no difference between hearing different types\nof words before naming the picture in Classes 1 and 9, but only in Classes 3 and 7.\nPlanned comparisons were carried out and revealed the following (throughout,\nwhere no results are reported, the comparisons were not significant): in Class 7 there\nwas also a significant difference found in planned comparisons between concordant\nprimes and both neutral primes (mean difference = 61.771, SE = 14.779, p = .001) and\ndiscordant primes (mean difference = 45.940, SE = 17.671, p = .044). Hence in Class 7\n(prefix ki-) picture naming following a grammatical prime word (kipo) was faster than\nfollowing an ungrammatical prime word or a neutral prime word (\u2018sema\u2019); in Class 3\nthough there was a significant effect of the type of prime word, it was less easily\nbroken down than in Class 7.\nEffects of the presence of a prefix. In Classes 1 and 9 some words carry a prefix and\nsome words do not. The interaction between prefix and class can be seen in Figure 3.\nIt seemed possible that this confound might be responsible for the absence of the\npredicted priming effect for some Class 1 and 9 nouns. This possibility was examined\nin an ANOVA looking at prime, presence of a prefix, and at noun class. The analysis\nrevealed that there was a significant main effect of noun class, F(1, 28) = 107.474, p<.001,\nsuch that Class 9 words were faster. There was a significant main effect of prefix,\nF (1, 28) = 97.412, p < .001, such that unprefixed words were named faster, but no\nsignificant effect of prime. Finally, there was a significant interaction between class\nand prefix, F (1, 28) = 6.106, p = .020.\nHence words in Class 9 (unprefixed or with a nasal prefix) were named faster\nthan those in Class 1 (with m- prefix or unprefixed, and animate). In both noun classes\nunprefixed words were named faster, and the difference was greater for Class 1.\nLanguage and Speech\nK. J. Alcock and D. Ngorosho 17\nHowever there was no significant effect overall on these words of hearing a grammat-\nical prime rather than an ungrammatical or neutral prime (\u2018say\u2019), nor was there any\ninteraction between prefix and prime or noun class and prime.\nSince reaction time is measured using a voice key, it is possible that low-salience\nnasal-prefixed words are picked up more slowly on the whole than nonprefixed words,\nwhich can begin with any consonant \u2014 including some higher salience consonants\nsuch as stop consonants. However, the comparison above between Class 3 words\n(always with an m- prefix) and Class 7 words (always with a ki- prefix) shows there is\nno significant difference in RT between these two classes, suggesting that the voice key\nis equally efficient at picking up both types of consonant.\nInteraction of phonology and grammatical agreement. Nouns in Class 1 that have a\nprefix, and nouns in Class 3 (where all nouns are prefixed) share the same prefix \n(m-), even though the grammatical prime for these classes is different. Nouns in Class 1\nthat have no prefix and nouns in Class 9 (where the majority of nouns are unpre-\nfixed) again have in common that they have no prefix, and again have different\ngrammatical primes.\nThis effect \u2014 of common prefix but different grammatical prime \u2014 was investi-\ngated. Items were divided into three types: Primes that are grammatical with a particular\nnoun class, primes that can plausibly be followed by a particular prefix but are not\ngrammatical (i.e., they \u201csound right\u201d even though they are not), and primes that\ncannot plausibly precede a particular prefix were compared, across noun classes, for\nClasses 1 (prefixed), 1 (unprefixed) and 3. For simplicity, we will refer to items in the\n\u201cplausible sounding\u201d conditions as \u201cpseudoprimes.\u201d These separate conditions can\nbe summarized as follows:\nLanguage and Speech\n18 Kiswahili noun class processing\nFigure 3\nAnalysis of\nnoun class\nand prefix\ninteractions\n\u2013 Adults \nClass Prefix Grammatical Pseudoprime Ungrammatical-\nprime implausible \nprimes\n1 m- yupo upo kipo, ipo\n[ grammatical prime \nfor Class 3 ]\n1 \u00d8 yupo ipo upo, kipo\n[ grammatical prime \nfor Class 9 ]\n3 m- upo yupo ipo, kipo\n[ grammatical prime \nfor Class 1 ]\nAll of these comparisons can be seen in Figure 4.\nAn ANOVA examining all of these classes comparing grammatical primes,\npseudoprimes, and ungrammatical primes, revealed main effects of plausibility, F (2, 27)\n= 10.342, p < .001, and, as before, noun class, F (1, 28) = 75.946, p < .001. Hence the\ndifference in naming times between the classes held up, with Class 1 being named\nslower than Class 3, and the primes that were more plausible (and not necessarily\nmore grammatical) caused pictures to be named faster.\nLanguage and Speech\nK. J. Alcock and D. Ngorosho 19\nFigure 4\nEffect of plausibility and\ngrammaticality of prime\n\u2013 Adults\nPlanned comparisons are necessary to untangle the effect of specific phono-\nlogical plausible pseudoprimes on specific classes. These revealed that for Classes 1\n(prefixed words, m- prefix) and 3 (also m- prefix), reaction time after a grammatical\nprime is no faster than reaction time after an ungrammatical pseudoprime, suggesting\nthat the critical factor lies in the fact that nouns in these classes have the same prefix \u2014\nproduction of nouns in both of these classes was primed equally by primes from the\nother noun class, which shares a prefix.\nHowever, for both noun classes, reaction times for both grammatical and pseudo-\nprimes were faster than reaction times with a prime that is ungrammatical-implausible\n(grammatical prime vs. ungrammatical-implausible prime, mean difference = 60.565,\nSE = 18.978, p = .010; pseudoprime vs. ungrammatical-implausible prime, mean\ndifference = 115.806, SE = 30.981, p = .003).\nHence the naming of pictures in Classes 1 (prefixed) and 3 is primed equally by\ngrammatical primes from their own and the other, phonologically similar, class, even\nthough the primes from the other class are not grammatical. Naming is not primed\nby ungrammatical-implausible primes, which come from other classes.\nFor Class 1 (unprefixed), there was an effect of plausibility, F (2, 27) = 42.313,\np < .001, and it was found that reaction times after pseudoprimes were faster than\nboth those for grammatical primes and those for ungrammatical-implausible primes\n(mean difference = 202.360, SE = 22.177, p < .001 for comparison to grammatical\nprimes, mean difference = 299.805, SE = 36.349, p < .001 for comparison to ungram-\nmatical-implausible primes), while the difference between grammatical primes and\nungrammatical-implausible primes approached significance. Hence unprefixed nouns\nin Class 1 are primed more by grammatical primes from another class (Class 9, which\nis generally unprefixed) than by primes from their own class, and are not primed by\nungrammatical-implausible primes from other classes.\n3.2\nChildren\nOverall summary and numbers correct. The mean number correct out of 216 pictures\nusing the lenient scoring method for the children was 199.39 with a standard devia-\ntion of 8.20; mean number correct by the strict scoring method was 192.87 with a\nstandard deviation of 10.68.\nFor the children as with the adults an overall effect of the scoring method (strict\nmethod vs. lenient method) was found, F (1, 37) = 133.830, p < .001. There was also\nan interaction between scoring method and noun class, F (3, 35) = 5.892, p = .001, but\nthere was no effect of class. As with the adults, it seems as if the scoring method\nmakes a bigger difference in Class 1. This can be seen in Figure 5.\nEffects of prime and noun class on number correct. Using the lenient scoring method\n(which is used hereafter), the effect of prime and noun class on number correct was\nexamined and it was found that there was a significant effect of prime (concordant\nvs. neutral vs. discordant) on the number correct, F (2, 36) = 5.317, p = .007. Hence\nthe word heard before naming a picture affected the accuracy of naming the picture.\nLanguage and Speech\n20 Kiswahili noun class processing\nThere was also a significant effect of class on the number named correctly,\nF (3, 35) = 2.814, p = .043. Planned comparison revealed that the difference in prime\nconditions was such that more pictures were named correctly in the concordant condi-\ntion than the neutral condition (mean difference = 0.329, SE = .093, p = .003). For\nthe effect of class, more pictures were named correctly in Class 7 than in Class 9\n(mean difference = 0.474, SE = .166, p = .042).\nThe effect of the presence or absence of a prefix on the number correct was also\nexamined for Classes 1 and 9 and a significant effect of the presence of a prefix was\nfound, F (1, 37) = 48.636, p < .001. It was found that words without a prefix were\nnamed correctly more often.\nEffects of prime and noun classes on reaction time. The interaction between prime\nand noun class can be seen in Figure 6.\nLanguage and Speech\nK. J. Alcock and D. Ngorosho 21\nFigure 5\nInteraction\nbetween\nnoun class\nand scoring\nmethod\n(strict vs.\nlenient) \n\u2013 Children\nFigure 6\nEffect of prime\nand noun class\n\u2013 Children\nThe mean reaction time for picture naming was 1008.83, with a standard devi-\nation of 117.57.\nExamining the effects of type of prime (concordant, neutral or discordant) and\nthe noun class on reaction time, an effect of noun class, F (3, 35) = 32.705, p < .001,\nwas seen, together with an interaction between prime and noun class, F (6, 32) = 2.312,\np = .035. The effect of prime approached significance, F (2, 36) = 2.525, p = .087.\nHence words in some noun classes were named faster than others; and the type of prime\nword heard before naming a picture affected speed of naming in some classes.\nPlanned comparisons revealed that naming of items in Class 1 was slower than\nin all other classes (comparison to Class 3 mean difference = 113.689, SE = 15.992,\np < .001, comparison to Class 7 mean difference = 113.200, SE = 17.275, p < .001,\ncomparison to Class 9 mean difference = 157.801, SE = 20.046, p < .001). In addition,\nitems in Class 9 were named faster than items in Class 7 (mean difference = 44.601,\nSE = 14.624, p = .025). Hence words in noun Class 1 (m- or no prefix, animate nouns)\nwere named more slowly than other nouns; and words in Class 9 (nasal prefix or no\nprefix, inanimate nouns) were named faster than other nouns.\nThere was also a significant difference between words named after a concordant\nprime and words named after a discordant prime (mean difference = 20.080, SE = 7.172,\np = .024). Hence hearing a grammatical prime before a word meant that the word was\nnamed faster than if an ungrammatical prime was heard, regardless of class.\nEffects of the presence of a prefix. The effect of the presence or absence of a prefix\nwas examined for nouns in Class 1 and Class 9. Significant effects of both prefix,\nF (1, 37) = 164.699, p < .001, and class, F (1, 37) = 42.470, p < .001, were found, but\nthere was no interaction. Class 1 nouns (m- prefix or no prefix) were named more slowly\nthan Class 9 nouns (nasal prefix or no prefix), and nouns with a prefix (in either class)\nwere named more slowly than nouns without a prefix. This can be seen in Figure 7.\nLanguage and Speech\n22 Kiswahili noun class processing\nFigure 7\nAnalysis of noun\nclass and prefix\ninteractions \n\u2013 Children \nEffect of individual prefixes. As with the adult participants, the effect on picture\nnaming of phonologically plausible but ungrammatical primes (pseudoprimes) was\nexamined for Classes 1 (with prefix, which is m-) and 3 (which always has the prefix\nm-). These comparisons can be seen in Figure 8.\nA main effect of plausibility was found, F (2, 36) = 21.094, p < .001, as well as\none of class, F (1, 37) = 131.086, p < .001. Hence naming was not equally fast following\nall types of primes (grammatical primes, phonologically plausible pseudoprimes, and\nungrammatical-implausible primes), and as before naming of words in Class 1 was\nslower than words in Class 3.\nPlanned comparisons revealed that both the grammatical primes and pseudoprimes\nwere followed by faster naming than the primes that were ungrammatical-implausible\n(mean difference for grammatical primes = 77.498, SE = 13.755, p < .001, mean differ-\nence for plausible primes = 116.271, SE = 20.501, p < .001). Hence for Class 1 nouns\nwith a prefix (m-) and Class 3 nouns which have the same prefix (m-), naming was primed\nto an equal extent by the prime that was grammatical for the other class (upo and yupo\nrespectively), and therefore phonologically plausible, and to the grammatical prime\n(yupo, upo), but not by the primes that were grammatical for other classes (kipo, ipo).\nThis comparison was also carried out on Class 1 unprefixed nouns, comparing\nthe grammatical prime (yupo), the pseudoprime (ipo, which is grammatical for other\nunprefixed words, those in Class 9) and the other, ungrammatical-implausible primes.\nAgain there was an effect of plausibility, F (2, 36) = 45.436, p < .001, and planned\ncomparisons revealed that the pseudoprime, ipo, primed naming more than either\nthe grammatical prime, yupo (mean difference = 177.349, SE = 21.087, p<001) or than\nLanguage and Speech\nK. J. Alcock and D. Ngorosho 23\nFigure 8\nEffect of plausibility and\ngrammaticality of prime \n\u2013 Children\nthe items that were ungrammatical-implausible (mean difference = 233.789, SE = 30.779,\np < .001).\nHence for unprefixed words in Class 1, priming was greater by the phonologically\nplausible pseudoprime (ipo) from Class 9 (which is mostly unprefixed) than by the gram-\nmatical prime for this class (yupo).\n4Discussion\nIn this experiment we have demonstrated facilitatory grammatical priming for words\nin different noun classes in Kiswahili, a language with a relatively large number of gender-\nlike noun classes. For the adult group, priming was seen with respect to neutral\nconditions and for the children, with respect to discordant conditions. These priming\neffects were not equivalent in all conditions. Two of the noun classes, Classes 3 and 7,\nhave obligatory prefixes, and these classes demonstrated more priming than the other\ntwo classes, 1 and 9, which do not always have a prefix. However, it does not seem to\nbe true that prefixed words are primed while unprefixed words are not. When words\nin these two classes with and without prefixes were compared, there was no extra\npriming for words with prefixes.\nThe solution to this conundrum seems to be found when comparisons were made\nbetween words that come from grammatically different noun classes but that share a\nprefix. In these cases, the words in each class should, based on classical grammar,\nhave distinct grammatical primes. However, on purely phonological grounds, the\nprefix for one category sounds identical to the prefix for another, which leads to the\npossibility of phonologically based pseudopriming. That is, an ungrammatical prime\ncould have a facilitatory effect if it \u201csounds right.\u201d\nIn the case of words in Class 1, this is precisely what happens\u2014words are primed\nby modifiers intended for another noun class that shares the same prefix. These\npseudoprimes are different for words that have or do not have a prefix, and this may\ngo some way towards explaining why the grammatical prime for Class 1 did not seem\nto cause priming overall in Class 1. Some words in Class 1 are primed by the gram-\nmatical prime for that class (yupo) and are also primed by one other prime (upo, which\nis the grammatical prime for Class 3); some words in Class 1 are only primed by the\ngrammatical prime for Class 9 (ipo) and are not primed by the grammatical prime for\nClass 1.\nIt is interesting that this pseudopriming effect \u2014 priming by modifiers that are\ngrammatical for other classes\u2014also happens in Class 3. In Class 3, priming is observed\nbut there were fewer distinct differences found in planned comparisons tests between\nprime types than were found in Class 7, where no such effect of plausible but ungram-\nmatical prime could be found \u2014 the prefix for Class 7, ki-, is distinct to this class.\nThere remains the anomaly that no priming at all is found in Class 9. This is the\nclass with the largest number of words, and while in Class 1 words with prefixes are\nmuch more common than those without, the opposite is true in Class 9. Of all the words\nin the language, 27% are unprefixed words in Class 9. If normally a prime prepares\nthe listener for a particular prefix, and most of the words in this class have no prefix,\nthis may be why they are primed less than other words. It is also possible that there\nLanguage and Speech\n24 Kiswahili noun class processing\nis no further leeway for priming to occur in words in this class (i.e., a floor effect for\nthe unmarked or standard form). In fact, evidence that gender priming may not occur\nfor the unmarked (masculine) gender has been reported for Russian (Akhutina et\nal., 2000).\n4.1\nConclusions\nIn summary, we have shown here that in Kiswahili, a highly inflected language with\nmultiple noun classes, grammatical noun class priming can be demonstrated for picture\nnaming in the same way that it has been shown in languages with simpler gender\nsystems (Wicha et al., 1997).\nMore interestingly, however, we have shown convincingly that this priming is\ndependent on the phonological form of the noun class prefix, apparently so much so\nthat where there is a conflict between phonological form and classical grammatical\nnoun class, the phonological form can take precedence. Phonological processing and\ngrammatical processing do not just interact, they appear to be equivalent (Bentrovato\net al., 1998).\nIt is possible that what is being primed is the noun class prefix rather than words\nin a particular noun class. There is evidence from this experiment for either side of\nthis argument. In favor is the point that when a subject hears a pseudoprime they\nproduce a word in the noun class that has pseudoagreement with the prime faster (e.g.,\nwhen hearing yupo, which agrees grammatically with words in Class 1, whether they\nhave an m- prefix or not, mti, a Class 3 word with an m- prefix, is primed); but they\nare no more likely to incorrectly produce a whole word from the noun class which\nagrees grammatically with the prime. This suggests that the prefix is primed, rather than\nthe whole word; whole word errors are equally likely in all prime \/ class combinations.\nHowever in opposition to this suggestion it is possible to argue that a whole\nword could still be primed, but the semantic properties of the picture prevent whole\nword errors. In addition, it is hard to see how priming of only the prefix of a word\ncould explain priming of whole, unprefixed words in Class 1 by primes that are gram-\nmatically correct for Class 9, which is largely unprefixed.\nIn any case, whether the prefix or the whole word is primed by pseudoprimes that\nagree with a noun class that shares a prefix with the word that is primed, it cannot be\nthe case that the pseudoprimes are priming solely morphologically. Primes that are\nin two different noun classes are grammatically separate \u2014 they have different agree-\nments with other constituents of the sentence, and untimed grammatical judgments\nconfirm the theoretical grammatical separateness, in the face of on-line cross-priming.\nIn this study it has been possible to investigate this phenomenon in a popula-\ntion that is computer-na\u00efve and has a generally low level of education, using a task\nthat appears natural to participants \u2014 naming a picture \u2014 with a similarly natural\nprime presented auditorily. This technique does not rely on participants\u2019 metalin-\nguistic skills and judgments, or overt knowledge of grammatical noun classes. Many\nprevious experiments have relied on having relatively literate participants, or have\nused overt grammaticality judgments, and hence may not reflect the on-line grammat-\nical processing that takes place in real language use. Where a more naturalistic type\nLanguage and Speech\nK. J. Alcock and D. Ngorosho 25\nof task, more similar to our experiment, has been used with highly literate and gram-\nmatically educated participants, it is possible that some feature of their education has\nled them to perform in a certain way. These very similar results with participants with\na much lower level of education also add interpretative power to other similar studies.\nIn addition, our similar results in our two subject groups \u2014 older children in educa-\ntion and adults who had very few years of education and whose education had finished\na few years previously \u2014 add weight to the suggestion that these effects are not due,\nfor example, to instruction in formal grammar.\nThe mean level of facilitatory priming found the mean difference in latency\nbetween a word named after a neutral prime (\u2018say\u2019) and a concordant prime (the\nagreeing form of \u2018to be here\u2019), was approximately 30 ms for adults, with a similar\ndifference being seen between concordant and discordant primes for children. This\nseems a small effect but it is significant, and there are a number of features which mean\nthat this effect size is still interesting. Firstly, all the pictures were practiced twice\nbefore the experiment started. Hence, even on the first experimental trial with each\npicture, it had been named twice. Secondly, upon closer analysis, while it was found\nthat the average amount of priming was 30 ms, this concealed great variability. In\nClass 3 and Class 7, whose nouns consistently carry a prefix, the mean amount of facil-\nitation was approximately 70 ms. In Class 1 and Class 9, where some nouns carry a\nprefix and some do not, this facilitation did not appear to be present.\nWithin Class 9 there are other possibilities, however. Words with the N- prefix\n(nasal consonant), which is the regular prefix for Class 9, have a very low type frequency,\ncomprising only 2% of words in the language. Words with no prefix that take Class 9\nagreements are probably the most frequent type in the language. It is possible that the\nprime ipo which is grammatical for Class 9 does not facilitate naming of words with\nan N- prefix (nasal consonant) because these words are so unlikely to occur. There is\nalso another similar word which can prime these words, zipo, which would be the\ngrammatical prime for the plural of this class. Since the words in Class 9 remain\nunchanged in the plural, but additional words take the N- prefix in the plural (words\nin Class 11 \/ 14 also take this prefix in the plural), more words have N- prefix and\nagree with zipo than have N- prefix and agree with ipo. Further investigation might\ndetermine the cause of this particular effect. It is interesting, however, to note the\nresults of Akhutina et al. (2000). In the Russian three gender system, as in Kiswahili,\nthe most common gender (masculine, in the case of Russian) is also unmarked, and\nno priming effect was found in this gender. This combination of more than two\ngenders, one of which is unmarked and very frequent, is not found in previously inves-\ntigated Western European languages.\nWhen looking more closely at the nouns in Class 1, it was found that naming of\nthese nouns was not only being facilitated by the prime that was grammatical for this\nclass. In Class 1, most nouns have a prefix (m-) but a substantial minority do not. In\nthe language as a whole, the majority of nouns that do not have a prefix are in other\nclasses than Class 1, and therefore do not take Class 1 agreements. In fact the majority\nof unprefixed nouns are in Class 9 and take Class 9 agreements. Class 1 is not the only\nclass to have m- prefixes; it shares these prefixes with Class 3, and the type frequency\nof nouns in Class 1 and Class 3 is roughly equal.\nLanguage and Speech\n26 Kiswahili noun class processing\nIf speakers are only dependent on the grammaticality of a prime when their\nnaming of a picture is facilitated by that prime, then these shared prefixes and the prob-\nability of a word with a particular prefix being in a certain noun class should be of\nno importance. If, however, speakers rely on the likelihood of the next word having\na particular prefix, based on what they have heard, then the fact that more than one\nnoun class can have a particular prefix should be very revealing.\nSince some words in Class 1 and all words in Class 3 can have an m- prefix, but\ntheir grammatical primes are different (yupo and upo respectively) then if speakers are\nrelying only on grammaticality, then yupo should not prime Class 3 and neither should\nupo prime Class 1 words with m- prefixes. If speakers rely on the probability of an\nupcoming prefix, an upcoming word form, then yupo should prime Class 3 words,\nand upo should prime Class 1 words that have an m- prefix. The latter was indeed found\nto be the case. It was not the case, however, that all of the non-neutral primes primed\nthese classes equally. These two primes were equivalent to each other but faster than\nthe two primes that can be neither grammatical nor associated with the m- prefix, ipo\nand kipo.\nA similar pattern was found with words in Class 1 that do not have a prefix. Here\nif speakers depend entirely on grammaticality then yupo should be the only prime to\ncause facilitation. If, however, speakers are relying on the probability of a particular\nprefix following a prime, then there should also be priming by ipo, which can be\nfollowed by an unprefixed word. In fact, not only was there facilitation of naming by\nipo but unprefixed words in Class 1 were named 200 ms faster after ipo than after the\ngrammatical prime yupo. In fact, words were not named any faster after yupo, which\nis grammatical, than after the two primes that cannot be grammatical or associated\nwith unprefixed words, upo and kipo.\nHence it appears that speakers use the primes to determine what type of prefix\nmight be coming up in a following word. It is particularly interesting that words with\nthe m- prefix are equally likely to be in Class 1 or Class 3, and the grammatical primes\nfor each of these classes primes words from the other class by the same amount.\nHowever, the prime yupo is only rarely associated with unprefixed words \u2014 as the\nmajority of words in Class 1 do have a prefix \u2014 while the prime ipo is mostly associ-\nated with unprefixed words, as the majority of words in Class 9 have no prefix; with\nregards to priming, yupo does not appear to prime these unprefixed words at all, and\nthey are unlikely to appear in everyday speech after this word. It appears that a prime\nword may lead to the activation of all possible words that can follow that prime, based\non their prefixes, but preferentially of words that are more probable following the\nprime word, based on the frequency of each type of word in each class.\nThis pattern of priming\u2014equivalent priming for m- prefixed words by any prime\nthat can go with an m- prefixed word, and good priming of nonprefixed words only\nby the prime that goes with the most frequent type of word that is nonprefixed\u2014suggests\nthat grammatical priming cannot be described as dependent on grammatical noun class\nbut influenced by phonological form; it appears to be largely determined by the most\nlikely phonological form.\nA further possibility however might be that speakers were unsure about which\nprimes were correct, grammatically, when associated with the words in different classes,\nLanguage and Speech\nK. J. Alcock and D. Ngorosho 27\nleading to these slightly paradoxical patterns of priming and grammaticality effects.\nAs mentioned above, however, all of the words used in the experiment\u2014as well as those\nused in the practice trials \u2014 were selected based on untimed grammaticality judg-\nments by speakers from the same population as the participants. Previous research has\nsuggested that, in the final analysis, when semantics and morphophonemics conflict,\nspeakers rely on the semantics of a noun to determine which agreements it takes\n(Corbett, 1991), and this has been analyzed extensively for Kiswahili (Contini-Morava,\n1996). If the data from untimed grammaticality judgments alone were used, this would\nseem to hold up. Animate nouns, which are in Class 1, are generally judged under\nsuch circumstances to agree with yupo, regardless of their prefix. Inanimate nouns with\nan m- prefix are judged to be in Class 3 and to agree with upo. However, the data we\nhave presented here suggest that the effects of the prefix and of the probability of a\nnoun agreeing with a particular prime are both very strong, and may be even stronger\nthan the semantic effect. In fact, the traditional definition of a grammatical gender\nor noun class as the set of words that take a particular agreement may itself need\nrethinking.\nThere was no difference between the group of adults \u2014 who have some educa-\ntion but some years previously \u2014 and the group of school students, who have at least\nfour years of immediately recent grammatical instruction and who are currently in\neducation. Hence it does not seem to be the case that being in an educational situa-\ntion where the \u201ccorrect\u201d grammatical agreements might be emphasized affects subjects\u2019\nprocessing of grammatical agreement and phonological form.\nThis study makes an important contribution to the literature on grammatical\nprocessing in speech production. In Vigliocco & Hartsuiker\u2019s (2002) terms, the \u201cjoints\u201d\nbetween grammatical agreement processing and phonological processing appear to\nbe leaky to the point where selection of the next \u2014 grammatically agreeing \u2014 word in\nthe sentence does not just seem to be influenced by phonological processing but to\nbe largely dependent on such processing. This study has wider implications for data\nfrom other languages, such as that pertaining to the classic problem of the English\nregular and irregular past tense (Bird et al., 2003).\nReceived: December 11, 2000; first revision received: July 16, 2002; second revision\nreceived: July 16, 2003; accepted: September 26, 2003\nReferences\nAKHUTINA, T., KURGANSKY, A., KURGANSKAYA, M., POLINSKY, M.,\nPOLONSKAYA, N., LARINA, O., BATES, E., & APPELBAUM, M.
