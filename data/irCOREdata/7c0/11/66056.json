Correspondence e-mail:\njohn.evans@durham.ac.uk\nIn this paper the method of parametric Rietveld refinement is described, in\nwhich an ensemble of diffraction data collected as a function of time,\ntemperature, pressure or any other variable are fitted to a single evolving\nstructural model. Parametric refinement offers a number of potential benefits\nover independent or sequential analysis. It can lead to higher precision of\nrefined parameters, offers the possibility of applying physically realistic models\nduring data analysis, allows the refinement of \u2018non-crystallographic\u2019 quantities\nsuch as temperature or rate constants directly from diffraction data, and can\nhelp avoid false minima.\n1. Introduction\nIt is well established that by performing diffraction studies as a\nfunction of an external variable (frequently temperature, time,\npressure or chemical environment) one can learn more about\na system than from a single diffraction experiment. Examples\nare numerous but include probing structural phase transitions\nor intermolecular forces, looking at the influence of magnetic\nor electric fields, or monitoring chemical reactions\/transfor-\nmations. In some cases, it is possible to extract \u2018non-crystal-\nlographic\u2019 information (i.e. information beyond fractional\ncoordinates, site occupancies and atomic displacement para-\nmeters, ADPs) from such measurements. Examples include\nextracting information about vibrational frequencies (David et\nal., 1999) from thermal expansion parameters or ADPs (Bu\u00a8rgi\n& Capelli, 2000; Radaelli et al., 1996), or information such as\nactivation energies or reaction mechanisms from time-\ndependent studies (David et al., 1993; Allen & Evans, 2003,\n2004; Kisi & Riley, 2002; Evans & Evans, 2004; Milanesio et al.,\n2003; Grizzetti & Artioli, 2002; Walton & O\u2019Hare, 2000). Such\napplications are becoming increasingly widespread, especially\nin the field of powder diffraction, where the advent of high-\nintensity sources and area detectors at both central facilities\nand home laboratories means that extremely rapid high-\nquality measurements can now be performed (in minutes in a\nhome laboratory or at a neutron source, and in a matter of\nseconds or less at a synchrotron).\nThe traditional way to treat data from such studies has been\nto use Rietveld refinement to analyse individual data sets\nindependently. If, for example, one recorded 100 powder\ndiffraction patterns at different temperatures, each requiring\nrefinement of 20 parameters, one would perform 100 inde-\npendent refinements using 2000 parameters in total. It is clear,\nhowever, that these 2000 parameters are not completely\nindependent. The fractional coordinate of an atom at\ntemperature T will clearly be related (provided that no phase\ntransition occurs) to its coordinate at T \u0002 \u0002T. In such a study,\none often does not want to determine n parameters at m\ntemperatures, but how the n key parameters evolve with\ntemperature. There are also often parameters which ought to\nremain unchanged throughout the diffraction experiment.\nExamples might be the 2\u0002 zero point of a laboratory\ndiffractometer, or the unchanging chemical composition of a\nsample. If our 100 diffraction patterns were recorded for 1 min\neach, the uncertainty in a zero-point correction from an\nindividual data set would be large, leading to large uncer-\ntainties in other parameters; if, however, one could derive this\nquantity from all 100 patterns collected for 100 min simulta-\nneously, its uncertainty would be considerably reduced.\nIn this paper we describe a general methodology for\naddressing this issue in which any parameter can be described\nby a single overall value or by a function describing its\nevolution throughout the data collection, and can be simul-\ntaneously refined from a large body of diffraction data. For\nconvenience we call this approach \u2018parametric Rietveld\nrefinement\u2019 to emphasize that one parametrically fits a three-\ndimensional surface of 2\u0002, intensity and temperature (or time,\npressure, etc.) space. This approach offers potential benefits\nover sequential analysis: it can significantly reduce correla-\ntions between parameters and reduce final standard uncer-\ntainties; it can allow one to introduce simple physically\nmeaningful constraints or restraints to a refinement; it can\nhelp one avoid false minima with low-quality individual data\nsets; and it can allow the direct refinement of \u2018non-crystal-\nlographic\u2019 parameters such as temperature and rate constants\nfrom diffraction data. x2 of this paper will outline the philo-\nsophy\/methodology of the approach. x3 contains information\non calibration materials used for the examples described. x4\ndescribes three applications: the use of parametric refinement\nto reduce uncertainties in cell-parameter determination; the\nuse of internal standards to refine the true experimental\ntemperature of a sample from diffraction data; and the use of\nparametric fitting to extract kinetic information.\nThe philosophy behind the method is, of course, similar to\nthe use of multiple data sets across an X-ray absorption edge,\nmultiple banks of a time-of-flight neutron data set or\nelectronic reprint\ncombined neutron and X-ray data sets to improve structural\nprecision. Limited linking of parameters between data sets for\nsuch applications is available in several Rietveld codes but, to\nthe best of our knowledge, the only previous implementation\nof constraint equations is in the XND code, which allows the\nuse of simple polynomials for selected variables (Berar &\nBaldinozzi, 1998). The method we describe is, however,\nentirely general, extremely flexible and can be used in a wide\nvariety of situations. We note that the mind-set to adopt when\napplying this approach is similar to that when using restraints\nor constraints in other areas of crystallography. One must\nensure that the \u2018extra information\u2019 one introduces during the\nrefinement is appropriate, otherwise the derived parameters\nwill be detrimentally affected.\n2. Methodology\nAll parametric refinements reported here have been\nperformed using the TOPAS-Academic software written by\nAlan Coelho (Coelho, 2000a). One significant aspect of this\nsoftware is that it supports user-defined equations in an\nentirely general way such that highly sophisticated\/specialized\nmodels can be introduced without access to the source code.\nThe software is also fast, robust and can handle an essentially\nunlimited number of parameters.\nThe general form of an input file used for parametric fitting\nis shown schematically in Fig. 1 for a variable temperature\nexperiment. A typical control file (for a case such as example 2\nbelow) has been deposited as supplementary information.1\nThe file contains a series of sections (one per temperature)\nwhich contain instructions required to perform Rietveld\nrefinement of each individual data set. Individual variables\nwithin these blocks can be assigned convenient names. In a\nvariable-temperature experiment, one might assign names\nsuch as a_t0300 or x_C1_t0300 to the a cell parameter and x\nfractional coordinate of atom C1 at 300 K, respectively. Simple\ninstructions also allow the values of selected parameters to be\noutput to a text file after refinement. There are then two\nsections which describe \u2018overall\u2019 parameters which apply to all\nthe data sets. These are separated for convenience into \u2018fixed\u2019\nand \u2018refinable\u2019 paramaters. The diffractometer zero point, for\nexample, could be defined as a single overall refinable para-\nmeter (zero_overall) and fed into each data set using equation\n(1):\nprm !zero t0300 \u00bc zero overall; \u00f01\u00de\nMost equations quoted use the TOPAS format, which is\ndefined elsewhere (Coelho, 2006); briefly, where a defined\nparameter (prm) has a name preceded by \u2018!\u2019, it is a fixed\nquantity; otherwise it is free to refine. Other variables might\nbe expected to show a simple dependence on temperature. For\nexample, it is frequently found that the sample height in a\nhigh-temperature laboratory Bragg\u2013Brentano experiment\nvaries linearly with temperature due to thermal expansion of\nthe furnace. One would then describe the sample height at\neach set temperature (e.g. Tset = 300) by an expression such as\nequation (2):\nprm !Tset \u00bc 300\nprm !height t0300 \u00bc c1\u00fe c2 \u0003 Tset;\nth2 offset \u00bc \u00042 \u0003 height t0300 \u0003 Cos\u00f0Th\u00de=diffractometer radius;\n\u00f02\u00de\nwhere c1 and c2 are overall parameters refined from all the\ndata. This quantity would then be used to apply a correction of\nthe form described to the 2\u0002 values of the calculated data at\neach experimental temperature. Similar equations can be\nintroduced to apply a variety of 2\u0002 corrections for different\nexperimental factors.\nIn some situations (see below) one might wish to impose\nknown physical behaviour during a refinement. In example 2,\nwe apply the known thermal expansion of calibration mate-\nrials during multi-phase Rietveld refinement. This is done in\nthe overall fixed variables section. For example, cell para-\nmeters can frequently be accurately described by an expres-\nsion such as equation (3) over wide temperature ranges\n(Reeber, 1975; Wang & Reeber, 2000):\nln a \u00bc ln a0 \u00fe\nP\nn\ncn\u0002n=\u00bdexp\u00f0\u0002n=T\u00de \u0004 1\u0005; \u00f03\u00de\nwhere a0 is the cell parameter at 0 K, \u0002n an Einstein\ntemperature and cn an empirically derived coefficient. In\nTOPAS this can be expressed by defining a0, cn and \u0002n as fixed\nvalues in the overall section of the input file and passing this\ninformation into each individual data set. The relevant format\nwould be:\nresearch papers\n88 Stinton and Evans \u0006 Parametric Rietveld refinement J. Appl. Cryst.

If the cell parameter forced on the refinement\nby the prescribed equation (here !a_t0300) does not match\nthe experimental peak positions due to a discrepancy between\nthe furnace set temperature (Tset) and the true sample\ntemperature, one can introduce a refinable parameter\ndelta_t0300 to accommodate this. The relevant section of the\ninput file would become:\n0in T \u00bc 300 K section of file\nprm !Tset 300\nprm delta t0300 0\nprm !a t0300\u00bcExp\u00f0Ln\u00f0a0\u00de\u00fe\u00f0c1\u0003thetaE\u00de=\u00f0Exp\u00f0thetaE=\u00f0Tset-delta t0300\u00de-1\u00de\u00de\u00de;\nThe constraint equations described above are entirely\ngeneral: they can be applied to any refinable quantity (coor-\ndinates, occupancies, ADPs, etc.) and can be expressed in\nterms of any external variable. It would also be possible to\nrestrain (rather than constrain) fitting via parametric equa-\ntions which apply a penalty of the form (actual_value\u0004\nideal_value)2 with ideal values defined from all data by simple\nequations, though this approach has not been explored in this\nwork. To reduce correlations, equations are often expressed\nwith temperature or other quantities rescaled onto a \u00041 to +1\nscale using T* = [T \u0004 0.5(TMAX + TMIN)]\/(TMAX \u0004 TMIN)\nduring refinement.\nTo check that refinements converge to a global minimum, it\nis possible to adopt a simple simulated annealing approach in\nwhich refined quantities are displaced by random amounts\n(scaled by a \u2018temperature\u2019) at convergence and the data re-\nrefined, with the best R-factor solution being retained\n(Coelho, 2000b). Refinements can also be performed from a\nvariety of random starting positions. All refinements reported\nhere were initially performed using a \u2018normal\u2019 sequential\nindependent refinement strategy to provide benchmark values\nof parameters and agreement factors. For these individual\nrefinements, all parameters in the control file were named\naccording to a \u2018_t0000\u2019 convention. A local Fortran routine\nthen automatically replaces this label with one specific for\neach temperature, allowing input files for parametric refine-\nment to be generated rapidly. Temperatures are extracted\nautomatically, either from data file headers or from experi-\nment log files. Input files also included instructions to produce\ntext files of all refined parameters and their standard uncer-\ntainties.\nAll powder diffraction data reported here were recorded\nusing a Bruker d8 advance diffractometer equipped with a Cu\ntube, Ge(111) incident-beam monochromator and Vantec or\nBraun linear PSD (position-sensitive detector). High-\ntemperature measurements were performed using an Anton-\nPaar HTK1200 furnace. Low-temperature measurements were\nrecorded using an Oxford Cryosystems pHeniX cryostat. For\nfurnace measurements, the sample was ramped to tempera-\nture and held at constant temperature throughout the\ndiffraction experiment; in the cryostat the temperature was\nramped continuously and a single average temperature\ndetermined for each diffraction pattern from experimental log\nfiles.\n3. Non-ambient internal standards\nTwo examples of parametric refinement in this paper relate to\nthe determination of accurate and precise cell parameters of\nmaterials as a function of temperature. Obtaining accurate (as\nopposed to precise) non-ambient cell parameters from\nlaboratory Bragg\u2013Brentano data is not trivial. Peak 2\u0002 posi-\ntions and therefore cell parameters are influenced by a\nnumber of sample and instrumental factors, including sample\nheight, sample absorption, instrumental calibration, the peak\nshape model used and the experimental temperature (Klug &\nAlexander, 1974; Pecharsky & Zavilij, 2003; Beck & Mitte-\nmeijer, 2002). It is standard practice to correct for the first four\nof these effects using an internal standard such as NIST 640c\nsilicon, which has a = 5.4311946 A\u02da at 295.65 K (NIST, 2000)\nFor variable-temperature work, it is necessary to know the\ntemperature dependence of the cell parameters. For Si we\nhave taken thermal expansion data from 6 to 340 K provided\nby Lyon et al. and from 300 to 1500 K by Okada et al. (Lyon et\nal., 1977; Okada & Tokumaru, 1984). Data were normalized to\nfit the NIST 296.5 K cell value. We find that the experimental\ndata can be accurately described over the whole temperature\nrange by equation (3) with coefficients given in Table 1, with\nthe maximum discrepancy between fitted and expansion-\nderived cell parameters being <5 \u0007 10\u00045 A\u02da over the entire\ntemperature range.\nIn the case of Al2O3, thermal expansion data have been\ncollated by Toulakien and by Taylor (Taylor, 1984; Toulakian\net al., 1977). We have chosen to take Taylor\u2019s expression for\nthe temperature dependence of cell parameters [equation (4)].\nThe x0 values quoted differ from those of Taylor but yield cell\nparameters at 295 K consistent with those reported by Cline\nfor NIST SRM676 (NIST, 1991). Note that Taylor\u2019s expression\nuses temperature in \bC not K:\nc\u00f0T\u00de \u00bc c0\u00f01\u00fe c1T \u00fe c2T2\u00de: \u00f04\u00de\nFor non-ambient work, if the thermal expansion of the\ninternal standard were precisely known, it could be used to\ncalibrate experimental temperature (see below). This process\ncan, however, be prone to significant errors since a small\nsystematic error in cell parameter can lead to a large error in\ntemperature determination. For this reason, we prefer to\nemploy two internal standards at high temperature; one with\nlow expansion (e.g. Si) and one with high (e.g. Al2O3). Since\nsystematic errors in cell determination of each standard will be\nsimilar, one can use the differential thermal expansion to\ndetermine temperature (Fig. 2c); the ratio of cell volumes, or\nresearch papers\nJ.

Examples\n4.1. Example 1 \u2013 improving precision of cell parameter\ndetermination\nThis example shows that by treating data as an evolving\nensemble using parametric refinement and internal standards,\nit is possible to obtain accurate values of cell parameters and\nto improve the precision with which they can be determined.\nRb[MnCr(CN)6].xH2O is one of a large family of Prussian\nBlue related materials. Many of these have been shown to\nundergo structural and\/or magnetic\/electronic transitions as a\nfunction of temperature, which are frequently manifested in\nthe thermal expansion of the material (Chapman et al., 2006;\nMargadonna et al., 2004a,b). As part of a series of experiments\n(Prassides, 2006), diffraction data were collected on this\nmaterial on cooling from 293 K to 16 K at a cooling rate of\n8 K h\u00041 using a pHeniX cryostat. Data were collected in\n\t40 min time slices over a 10\u201390\b 2\u0002 range\ncorresponding to a data set every \t5 K.\nAverage cryostat temperatures for each data\nset were extracted from a log of the experi-\nmental temperature with time. To obtain\nreliable cell parameters, the sample was\nmixed with Si before being sprinkled as a thin\nlayer on an Al plate. Due to the small amount\nof sample available and its relatively low\nabsorption, significant peaks due to the\nsample holder are present in the diffraction\npattern (Fig. 3). Extracting reliable cell\nparameters from the relatively weak sample\npeaks is therefore challenging.\nIn this experiment, the key factors to\nconsider when determining sample cell\nparameters are the calibration of the\ndiffractometer (zero points, PSD calibration,\netc.) and the sample height which will vary with temperature\ndue to thermal expansion of the cryostat. If the Al peaks are to\nbe fitted during sample cell determination (which gives an\nindependent estimate of the true cryostat temperature) it\nshould be remembered that the mounting method means that\nthe effective sample height will be offset slightly from the\neffective height of the Al holder surface.\nInitially we adopted a traditional approach to data analysis\nin which individual patterns were analysed separately. We\nselected a single T = 16 K data set and performed a three-\nphase refinement in which the sample and Si diffraction were\nfitted by the Rietveld method and peaks of the Al sample\nholder by the Pawley method (due to texture affecting\nintensities). Scale factors and peak shape parameters were\nrefined for each phase along with background terms. For Al\nand Rb[MnCr(CN)6].xH2O, the cubic cell parameter was\nallowed to refine along with a height correction for both Al\nand the sample (Si and sample heights were equated). The Si\ncell parameter was fixed at 5.42999 A\u02da and a 2\u0002 calibration was\napplied by refining coefficients of a second-order polynomial.\nPolynomial coefficients were then fixed at 16 K derived values\nresearch papers\n90 Stinton and Evans \u0006 Parametric Rietveld refinement J.

The lowest tick marks are Al peaks, the middle\ntick marks are for the sample, and the upper tick marks the Si internal standard.\nelectronic reprint\nand this model used to refine all subsequent temperatures\nindependently (44 parameters refined for 64 independent data\nsets = 2816 parameters in total). Rwp values for individual\nrefinements ranged from\t9.2 to\t8.6% with an average value\nof 8.914%.\nAn alternative protocol is to realise that several variables in\nthis experiment will, to a good approximation, remain\nunchanged or vary smoothly during the course of the experi-\nment. In particular, the 2\u0002 calibration polynomial and the\nheight offset between the sample and sample holder should\nremain unchanged; overall sample\/sample holder heights\nshould vary smoothly. These parameters are therefore better\nderived from the entire 42 h data ensemble than from a single\n40 min data set. To allow this, an equivalent parametric\nrefinement protocol was therefore followed to that used for\nindependent refinements.\nIn an initial round of parametric refinement, the Si cell\nparameter was expressed as a fixed quantity in terms of\nequation (3) and a 2\u0002 correction polynomial and sample height\noffset refined from all 64 data sets simultaneously; parameters\ndescribing an overall pseudo-Voigt peak shape were also\nrefined for each phase. In this process, a total of 1747 para-\nmeters were refined (19 overall parameters: 3 terms of a\ncalibration polynomial, a height offset\nbetween sample and holder and 5\noverall peak shape parameters per\nphase; 27 parameters per individual\ndata set: 15 background terms, 2 scale\nfactors, 2 cell parameters, an isotropic\noverall temperature factor for Si and\nthe sample, 5 hkl peak intensities for\nthe Al Pawley fit, and the sample\nheight of the Al holder). Coefficients\nof the 2\u0002 calibration polynomial were\nthen fixed and parametric Rietveld\nrefinement performed using a single\nparameter to describe the sample\nheight offset and with the Si cell\nallowed to refine freely. An overall Rwp\nof 9.05% was obtained with higher\ntemperature refinements showing\nslightly worse agreement factors than\nfor free refinements. Allowing Al peak\nshapes for each data set to refine\nindependently led to an overall Rwp =\n8.925%, individual Rwp values for each\ndata set that varied smoothly with\ntemperature, and smooth changes in\npeaks shape values; these minor\nvariations are presumably caused by\nsmall changes in sample height with\ntemperature. The parametric R factor\nis essentially the same as the average\nof those obtained by independent\nrefinements. Fig. 4 shows the equiva-\nlent of a standard Rietveld plot for the\nparametric refinement.\nFig. 5 shows the Si and sample cell parameters obtained by\nthis protocol compared with free refinements. While the\noverall trends in behaviour are comparable, the scatter on\ndata points from parametric fitting is considerably lower than\nfrom independent refinements. Average standard uncertain-\nties on Si cell parameters are 0.00028 A\u02da from individual\nrefinements and 0.00017 A\u02da from parametric fitting; for the\nresearch papers\nJ. Appl. Cryst.

The\nsignificantly narrower spread of values is also shown in\nFig. 5(c), which shows deviations of refined values from those\nof equation (3) for the two refinements.\nThe increased precision in cell determination can be traced\nto the precision with which the true sample height is deter-\nmined. For free individual refinements, the offset between the\n(well determined) Al height and that of the sample had an\naverage of 0.025 (2) mm (the standard deviation of all 64\nvalues refined being 0.002 mm; the average Rietveld-derived\nstandard uncertainty was 0.003 mm); from parametric fitting\nthe overall value was 0.0247 (3) mm. The precision to which\nthe sample height is determined is thus improved by an order\nof magnitude by parametric fitting. In essence, one is using the\nassumption of a constant offset between sample and sample\nholder to transfer the precision of Al height determination\n(\t0.0003 mm) to the sample. The true accuracy of height\ndetermination is, of course, much lower due to correlation with\ninstrumental calibration constants. We note that alternative\nparameterization strategies are possible in the parametric\nfitting approach. One can, for example, reduce the number of\nparameters by describing the Al and\/or sample height as a\nsimple function of temperature, e.g. three coefficients of a\npolynomial function to describe height replacing 64 indepen-\ndent parameters. For these data, using parameterized Al and\nsample heights in this way gives an overall Rwp of 8.927%,\nessentially unchanged from that using unconstrained heights.\nThe height offset between the sample and Al varied by less\nthan 0.002 mm between 16 and 293 K. The precision and\nvalues of refined cell parameters were essentially unchanged\nusing this model. This alternative approach thus validates the\nassumption of an insignificant change in sample offset from\nsample holder with temperature.\n4.2. Example 2 \u2013 refining \u2018non-crystallographic\u2019 parameters\nZrP2O7 is a material that has attracted attention for its\nunusual thermal expansion properties. At room temperature,\nit has been shown by 31P NMR and diffraction to have a\n3 \u0007 3 \u0007 3 pseudo-cubic orthorhombic structure (related to a\nsimple 1 \u0007 1 \u0007 1 cubic aristotype) containing a remarkable\n136 crystallographically unique atoms (King et al., 2001;\nStinton et al., 2006; Birkedal et al., 2006). On heating, the\nmaterial undergoes a phase transition to the simple cubic\nstructure with a phase transition temperature of 567 K\ndetermined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). To\nunderstand the origins of the low and even negative thermal\nexpansion behaviour in the wider AM2O7 family of materials\n(Evans et al., 1998), an accurate measure of the temperature\ndependence of unit-cell parameters is necessary.\nVariable-temperature powder diffraction data were\nrecorded on a sample of ZrP2O7 [the synthesis of which has\nbeen described elsewhere (Stinton et al., 2006)], mixed and\nground with equal masses of Si and Al2O3. 51 data sets were\nrecorded from 303 to 677 K on warming and cooling. A slow\nN2 flow was passed over the sample during measurements. In\nan initial round of analysis, each data set was Rietveld refined\nindependently using a simple cubic structural model for\nZrP2O7. At each temperature, a total of 53 parameters were\nrefined: 4 cell parameters (1 ZrP2O7, 1 Si, 2 for Al2O3), the\nsample height, 3 scale factors, 18 background parameters, 6\npeak shape parameters per phase, a peak asymmetry correc-\ntion, 7 isotropic displacement parameters (1 Zr, 1P, 2*O for\nZrP2O7; 1 for Si; 1 for Al and 1 for O of Al2O3) and a P\nfractional coordinate. Calibration of the 2\u0002 scale was\nperformed using the Si internal standard by application of a\nsecond order correction polynomial as described above with\ncoefficients determined from a 16 h data collection performed\nimmediately before the variable-temperature runs and with\nvalues fixed for subsequent refinements. Individual Rwp values\nvaried smoothly with temperature from 18.13 to 19.94% with\nan average of 18.94%.\nThe key quantity from these independent refinements, the\npseudo-cubic cell of ZrP2O7, is shown in Fig. 6. Whilst the\nphase transition from the 3 \u0007 3 \u0007 3 orthorhombic to the\n1 \u0007 1 \u0007 1 cubic structure is clearly visible, the phase transition\ntemperature (512\u2013527 K) is significantly lower than found by\ncalorimetry (567 K). However, significant discrepancies are\nresearch papers\n92 Stinton and Evans \u0006 Parametric Rietveld refinement J. Appl. Cryst.

Two methods have been used. In the first, instead of\nrefining the cell parameters of the internal standards for each\nindividual data set, they have been defined in terms of equa-\ntions (3) and (4) using the coefficients of Tables 1 and 2. For\neach data set, a \u0002T temperature offset was introduced and\nrefined as described in x2. This allows one to minimize the\ndiscrepancies between the observed and calculated peak\npositions of the internal standards. A total of 2501 parameters\nwere refined to fit simultaneously all 50 data sets. An overall\nRwp of 18.88% was achieved, similar to the average Rwp for\nindependent refinements. A plot of the temperature offset\nrefined from the diffraction data is shown in Fig. 7. One might\nexpect that the temperature gradients leading to discrepancies\nbetween actual and set temperatures in the furnace would vary\nsmoothly with set temperature. It is therefore possible to fit\nwith fewer parameters by defining a\u0002T correction polynomial\nof the form \u0002T = c0 + c1T + c2T\n2, where c0, c1 and c2 are\nparameters refined simultaneously from the whole data set.\nFitting using this second approach gave an overall Rwp of\n18.89%. The \u0002T calibration curve obtained is shown in Fig. 7.\nCell parameters plotted against the Rietveld-refined\ntemperature are shown in Fig. 6. The diffraction-derived phase\ntransition temperature lies between T = 550 and T = 567 K, in\nmuch better agreement with the DSC data.\nClearly the temperature steps in this experiment are too\ncoarse to define TC to closer than \u000215 K. To see how far our\nparametric fitting ideas can be pushed, we have collected 871\ndata sets for 4.75 min each in 2 K steps from 303 to 1173 K.\nEach data set contains a total of 4997 data points from 5 to 90\b\n2\u0002 (step size 0.017\b). Fig. 8 shows the results obtained on\nanalysing the data by two protocols. Fig. 8(a) shows results\nfrom independent refinement of each data set (53 parameters\nat 871 temperatures or 46163 parameters in total for inde-\npendent refinements) using a protocol similar to that\ndescribed above. There is significant scatter in the resulting\nparameters, particularly in temperatures refined from an\nindividual data set, but the general shape of the temperature\ndependence of the refined cell parameter is reasonable.\nFig. 8(b) shows the results of parametric fitting of the same\ndata using a \u0002T polynomial derived from all data simulta-\nneously. Using a 3 GHz desktop PC with 2 Gbyte of RAM, all\n871 data sets could only be refined on a realistic time scale by\nrebinning the step size and we therefore chose to refine every\nsecond data set. This requires a total of 13507 parameters (cf. a\ntotal of 23055 for equivalent independent refinements). Even\nwhen fitting 435 data sets simultaneously, each cycle of\nrefinement took \t1.5 min on a 3 GHz desktop PC, and\nconvergence was achieved within <25 cycles. A considerable\nreduction in the cell parameter scatter is achieved and the\nrefined phase transition temperature is between 567 and\n571 K, close to the DSC value of 567 K. The refined \u0002T\npolynomial is very similar to that of Fig. 7 over the tempera-\nture range of overlap.\nresearch papers\nJ. Appl. Cryst.

Example 3 \u2013 kinetic refinements\nThe cubic AM2O8 (A = Zr, Hf;M =\nW, Mo) family of materials display\ntwo unusual structural properties:\nthey show negative thermal expan-\nsion over a wide temperature range\n(Evans et al., 1999, 1996, 2000; Mary et\nal., 1996) and undergo an order\u2013\ndisorder transition at relatively low\ntemperatures (450 K for ZrW2O8,\n270 K for ZrWMoO8) which is asso-\nciated with the onset of oxygen\nmobility (Hampson et al., 2005, 2004;\nAllen & Evans, 2004, 2003). We have\npreviously described how the high-\ntemperature \u0003 phase of ZrWMoO8\ncan be quenched to low temperature;\npowder diffraction measurements as a function of time then\nallow the kinetics of the \u0003 (high temperature, oxygen disor-\ndered) to \u0004 (low temperature, oxygen ordered) phase to be\nfollowed by powder diffraction (Allen & Evans, 2004). The\nkinetics of oxygen mobility are revealed by the diffraction\ndata in two ways. Firstly, the fractional occupancies of certain\nsites change on ordering and the material changes symmetry\nfrom Pa\u00033 (\u0003) to P213 (\u0004). The kinetics can then be followed\nfrom the intensity of 0kl, k 6\u00bc 2n, reflections, forbidden in the \u0003\nphase but present in \u0004, or via Rietveld refinement of site\noccupancies. Secondly, there is a small positive volume change\nassociated with the oxygen ordering such that kinetic infor-\nmation can be extracted from unit-cell parameter changes.\nPreviously (Allen & Evans, 2004) we have reported a\nkinetic study of this system in which a series of isothermal\ndiffraction data were refined independently and kinetic\ninformation extracted from the resultant structural models.\nFig. 9(a) shows the key fractional occupancy and Fig. 9(b) the\nunit-cell parameter as a function of time extracted from 97\npowder patterns recorded over a period of 29 h at 215 K. Each\nindividual data set was independently fitted by Rietveld\nrefinement using a total of 32 parameters, implying 3104\nparameters in total (1 cell, 1 scale factor, a sample height, 6\nterms to describe a pseudo-Voigt peak shape function, 2 terms\nto describe additional broadening of 0kl reflections, 9 back-\nground terms, 11 fractional coordinates and a fractional\noccupancy). The average Rwp for all refinements was 29.007%.\nUsing parametric Rietveld methodology, the same data can\nbe fitted simultaneously. To achieve this, a single overall\nstructural model was used and fractional occupancies and cell\nparameters were described during parametric refinement by\nthe expressions\nfrac\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc c1\u00bd1\u0004 exp\u00f0\u0004kfract\u00de\u0005 \u00fe c2\nand\na\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc c3\u00bd1\u0004 exp\u00f0\u0004kcellt\u00de\u0005 \u00fe c4;\nwhere kfrac and kcell are rate constants for the change in\nfractional occupancy, t is time, and cn are refinable parameters.\nAll 97 data sets were then fitted with a total of 1860 para-\nmeters (11 overall structural parameters and 6 rate expression\ncoefficients; 97 times 19 peak shape, scale factor, height and\nbackground parameters per data set). An overall set of frac-\ntional coordinates is appropriate for this case; for more\ncomplex systems fractional coordinates could also be para-\nmeterized. An overall Rwp of 28.833% was achieved; the\nkinetic Rietveld fit is shown in Fig. 10. The lower Rwp value\ncompared with free refinements is due to individual free\nrefinements becoming stuck in false local minima which are\navoided by the use of a single overall structural model in the\nparametric refinement. Rietveld-refined rate expressions\nobtained are superimposed on data from independent\nrefinements in Figs. 9(a) and 9(b).

Conclusions\nWe have shown that parametric fitting can have significant\nadvantages over sequential fitting of parametric data sets.\nFirstly, data can be fitted using fewer free variables. Secondly,\nit is possible to use the entire data set to determine certain\nparameters which can reduce derived uncertainties and help\navoid false minima. Thirdly, it is possible to reduce the stan-\ndard uncertainties in parameters that would be significantly\ncorrelated from data collected at a single temperature. Finally,\nit becomes possible to refine non-crystallographic quantities\nsuch as experimental temperature and rate constants for\nkinetic processes directly from diffraction data.\nWe are indebted to Alan Coelho for providing the flexible\nsoftware platform that has enabled these studies and for many\nstimulating conversations and software developments during\nthe course of this and other work.
