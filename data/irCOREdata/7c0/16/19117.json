Transition to seizure is characterized by a rapid expansion and fusion of the neuronal populations\nresponsible forHFA, associatedwith a progressive slowing ofHFA, leading to a single,massive, hypersynchronous cluster generating the\nhigh-amplitude low-frequency activity of the seizure.\nIntroduction\nOne of the main disabling features of epilepsy is the unpredict-\nability of seizures. A variety of analytical techniques have been\ndeveloped to try to identify a state preceding seizures, the \u201cpreic-\ntal\u201d state (Litt and Lehnertz, 2002; Mormann et al., 2007). Most\nof these studies have focused on algorithmic seizure prediction\nand paid little attention to the underlying mechanisms of seizure\ngeneration (or ictogenesis). However, the existence of a preictal\nstate and its biological origins are far from clear (Lopes da Silva,\n2008; Sackellares, 2008). Greater insights are required into the\nmechanisms of neuronal and population behavior of the pre-\nictal period, not only to improve seizure prediction but also to\nhelp us understand the pathophysiological process of ictogen-\nesis (Mormann et al., 2007).\nA promising candidate phenomenon for a preictal marker is\nhigh-frequency activity (HFA), which is found most reliably in in-\ntracranial recordings (Mormann et al., 2007). Recent studies have\nsuggested an important role ofHFA in epileptogenesis (Bragin et al.,\n1999, 2000, 2004) and in seizure initiation (Allen et al., 1992; Fisher\net al., 1992; Bikson et al., 2003; Grenier et al., 2003; Bragin et al.,\n2005).However, studies specificallyontheroleofHFAin thepreictal\nstate are sparse, generally fail to address the cellular and network\nmechanisms of its buildup, and in some cases consider it an epiphe-\nnomenon (Worrell et al., 2004; Khosravani et al., 2005).\nIn the current work, we present cellular and network mecha-\nnisms and spatiotemporal dynamics of HFA, and of the preictal\nperiod, in the CA1 region of hippocampal slices in the low-calcium\nand high-potassiummodels. The preictal period is characterized by\nthe progressive global increase in neuronal firing that manifests ex-\ntracellularly as a buildup of HFA and a decrease in system complex-\nity. Immediately preceding the seizure, CA1 neuronal networks are\nat state of high sensitivity to perturbations. Any weak depolarizing\nand\/or synchronizing perturbation can cause transition to seizure.\nTransition to seizure is then characterized by rapid expansion and\nfusion of activity of neuronal populations generatingHFA, resulting\nin onemassive neuronal population generating seizure activity.\nMaterials andMethods\nTransverse hippocampal slices (400 \u0001m) were prepared from male\nSprague Dawley rats (180\u2013225 g; anesthetized with ketamine and me-\nReceived Feb. 1, 2010; accepted March 16, 2010.\nThis work was supported by Epilepsy Research UK Grants A0702 and A0937 (J.G.R.J., P.J.), Wellcome Trust Grant\n074771 (J.G.R.J., A.D.P.), and Institutional Research Plan AV0Z10300504 (M.P.).

All experiments were per-\nformedunder theAnimals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 of theUnited\nKingdom and institutional ethical review. The slices were stored, at room\ntemperature, submerged in a holding chamber filled with \u201cnormal\u201d ar-\ntificial CSF (ACSF) consisting of the following (in mM): 125 NaCl, 26\nNaHCO3, 3 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 1.25 NaH2PO4, and 10 glucose (aer-\nated with humidified 95% O2\u20135% CO2 mixture). After \u000160 min, slices\nwere transferred to an interface recording chamber, at 32\u00b0C, containing\nnormal ACSF.\nSpontaneous seizure-like events were induced by perfusion of slices\nwith low-calcium increased-potassium ACSF consisting of the following\n(in mM): 125 NaCl, 26 NaHCO3, 5 KCl, 0.2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 1.25\nNaH2PO4, and 10 glucose (bubbled with 95% O2\u20135% CO2 mixture).\nSlices generating activity \u00012 mV in amplitude were accepted in this\nstudy. In other slices, seizure-like eventswere induced by high-potassium\nACSF, which differed from normal ACSF only in a higher concentration\nof KCl of 8.5 mM. In the high-potassiummodel, temperature in chamber\nwas kept at 33\u201335\u00b0C.\nExtracellular field potentials were recorded using wire electrodes,\nwhich were fabricated in our laboratory from platinum\/iridiumwire (25\n\u0001m diameter, \u0003800 k\u0004 impedance; Advent Research Materials). Elec-\ntrodes were positioned individually under visual control using a micro-\nscope and eyepiece graticule. The majority of recordings was performed\nwith 8\u201310 electrodes inserted in the exposed surface of stratum pyrami-\ndale along the long axis of the CA1 region. In experiments with wide\nseparation of electrodes, the interelectrode distance was 200 \u0001m. In ex-\nperiments with close electrode separation, the distance between adjacent\nelectrodes was 25 \u0001m. Electrode positions were photographed using a\ndigital eyepiece camera (World Precision Instruments). Interelectrode\ndistance thenwasverifiedusing theNIHImageJprogram(http:\/\/rsb.info.\nnih.gov\/ij). Extracellular field potentials were preamplified using Neura-\nlynx head-stage amplifier, amplified (500\u0005), and low-pass filtered\n(3 kHz) with Neuralynx Lynx-8 amplifiers.\nDirect-coupled (DC) recordings were performed with glass micropi-\npettes (2\u20138 M\u0004) filled with low-calcium ACSF. Electrodes were placed\nin the CA1 pyramidal cell layer. Signals were amplified with an\nAxoclamp-1A (Molecular Devices) and Neurolog NL-106 and NL-125\namplifiers (Digitimer).\nExtracellular unit activity was recorded with concentric tetrodes\n(Thomas Recording GmbH) or tetrodes fabricated from tungsten wire\n(13\u0001m; California FineWire). Single or three tetrodes (positioned close\nto each other) were used. Signals were preamplified, amplified 2000\u0005,\nand filtered (high cutoff frequency of 10 kHz) using Neuralynx.\nAll recorded signals were digitized using 1401 Plus or 1401 Power and\nSpike2 software (Cambridge Electronic Design). Extracellular field po-\ntentials were digitized at 2.5 or 5 kHz. Data from tetrodes were digitized\nat 20 or 25 kHz.\nUniform electric fields were applied via Ag\/AgCl (2mm in diameter, 4\ncm long) electrodes using a Bi-Phasic Stimulus Isolator DS4 (Digitimer)\nor an Analog Stimulus Isolator (model 2200; A-M Systems). Electrodes\nwere placed on either side of the hippocampal slice and oriented so that\ntheCA1b somatodendritic axis was parallel to the direction of the applied\nelectric field. The applied fields lasted 0.75 s. Schematics of recording\narrangements can be found in supplemental Figure 1 (available at www.\njneurosci.org as supplemental material).\nAll data analyses were performed using Spike2 software (Cambridge\nElectronic Design) and programs written in our laboratory and running\nunder Matlab (MathWorks). Epochs lasting 0.5 s containing HFA were\nanalyzed, and the power spectrumwas calculated using theMorlet wave-\nlet transforms (Li et al., 2007b). To quantify power spectral properties,\nmedian and first moment were calculated within the frequency range of\n10\u20131000 Hz. The temporal profile of changes in frequency was deter-\nmined from summated power in the frequency band 80\u2013250 Hz using\nwindows lasting 0.75 s. The synchronization of multichannel recordings\nwas analyzed using wavelet phase-synchronization methods. Because\nmost of the information, both interictal and ictal, in our signal occurs in\nthe frequency band 10\u2013250Hz, signals for synchronization analysis were\nbandpass filtered [10\u2013250 Hz, finite impulse response (FIR) filter]. Ep-\nochs lasting 0.2 s were analyzed. The amplitude and phase of field poten-\ntial recording do not necessarily change in parallel (Lachaux et al., 2002),\nso it was necessary to isolate phase synchronization between two sets of\nfield potential data. After Morlet wavelet transform, the phase informa-\ntion over the frequency bandwas obtained. The instantaneous phase\u0002(t)\nof the signal x(t) was determined. The phase difference between two\nseries is defined as\u0002n,m(t)\u0006\u00071(t)\b\u00072(t). The distribution of the cyclic\nrelative phase is \u0003(t)\u0006 \u0002(t)mod2\u0004. The wavelet phase synchronization\nindexwas calculated by\u0005 \u0006 \u0001\u0007cos\t\nt\u000b\b2 \t \u0007sin\t\nt\u000b\b2, where the\nbrackets denote the average over time. The measure of synchronization\nstrength varies from 0 to 1. Phase synchronization was calculated be-\ntween all possible pairs of channels so the synchronization matrix was\ngenerated. This matrix brings information about the spatial profile of\nsynchrony and formation of clusters of synchrony between individual\nchannels. To quantify the formation of synchrony clusters and the syn-\nchrony profile, the synchronization matrix was analyzed using principal\ncomponent analysis and random matrix theory (Li et al., 2007a). This\nmethod decomposed the synchronization matrix to generate a set of\neigenvectors and eigenvalues. Then the following characteristics, based\non the analysis of eigenvectors and eigenvalues, were extracted: (1) global\nsynchronization index, which ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 denotes the\nabsence of synchrony and 1 denotes perfect (absolute) synchrony be-\ntween signals; (2) number of statistically significant synchrony clusters;\nand (3) synchronization index for each individual cluster, revealing the\namount of synchrony for that cluster. The global synchronization\nindex is derived from the maximal synchronization index.\nSpike sorting was performed using Spike2 spike sorting toolbox and\nMatlab routines. The continuously recordedwide-band signals were dig-\nitally high-pass filtered\u0001800Hz using a fast Fourier transform filter. The\ntimes of individual spikes were defined at their maximal negativities.\nUnits were initially clustered using KlustaKwik and then by a graphical\ncluster cutting in two-dimensional plots (Wilson and McNaughton,\n1993). The clustering process was based on the principle of plotting\ndifferent waveform parameters and features from different electrodes.\nPrincipal component analysis was also used to extract features, usually\nfrom the first three components. Interspike interval histograms and au-\ntocorrelograms were calculated during the clustering process. If no clear\nrefractory period (\u00032 ms) was detected in the autocorrelogram, then\nmore than one neuron must be contributing to that cluster and addi-\ntional feature combinations were examined to subdivide the cluster fur-\nther until a clear refractory period was present in the autocorrelogram\n(Csicsvari et al., 1999). Only units with clear refractory periods were\nincluded in the present analysis. Then cross-correlograms between all\npossible pairs of units were calculated and examined for symmetrical\ngaps in the center bins. The presence of a gap (common refractoriness)\nsuggested that two clusters represented activity of the same unit, and\ntherefore those clusters weremerged (Fee et al., 1996). Neurons with low\nfiring rates were included in the study only if the number of observed\nevents was higher than 500 (silent neurons).\nAfter the clustering procedure, several parameters were examined to\ndifferentiate pyramidal cells from interneurons. Spikes of each unit were\nextracted from the original wide-band recording and averaged. The av-\neraged spike was then resampled to 80 kHz and used to measure spike\nwidth at 25%of its amplitude. This was themain criterion to differentiate\nbetween interneurons (\u00030.4 ms) and pyramidal cells (\u00010.45 ms). Addi-\ntionally, autocorrelogram shape was used to differentiate between neu-\nronal subtypes.\nRaw wide-band recordings were bandpass (80\u2013250 Hz) filtered by an\nFIR filter. Troughs of individual oscillationwith amplitudes\u00015 and 7 SD\nof background activity were identified. Cross-correlation functions were\ncalculated between single-unit activity and individual cycles of the fast\nactivity, with the peak negativity of each cycle as the reference point.\nAutocorrelation and cross-correlation histograms were normalized by\ndividing the count in each bin by the total number in all bins.\nTo determine the role of neurons in generating HFA, individual cell\nfiring phase histograms were calculated, normalized by dividing each bin\nby total number of events (HFA cycles), and expressed as firing proba-\nbility histograms. Using the Rayleigh test, we determined whether the\nneuronal firing changed during HFA cycles (non-uniform distribution)\nor not (uniform distribution). The intensity (depth) of the change in\nJiruska et al. \u2022 Dynamics of Preictal State J. Neurosci., April 21, 2010 \u2022 30(16):5690\u20135701 \u2022 5691\nfiring probability was quantified by generating unit vectors (summation\nof spike phases) and normalized by number of spikes. The index of\nintensity of change ranged from 0 (uniform distribution) to 1 (values of\nall angles are the same).\nTo examine interactions (coupling) between neurons, we calculated\ncross-correlograms between spike trains of pairs of neurons. In situations\nwith weak coupling not manifested with obvious peaks in cross-\ncorrelograms, we used a surrogate approach to distinguish weak cou-\npling from random coincidence. To count the number of coincident\nspikes, we used a spike-centered bin algorithmwith bin size 5ms (typical\nduration of cycles of HFA). This approach detected coincident action\npotentials and their number.We thenused 200 surrogates for each pair of\nrecordings, generated by shuffling one of the original spike trains (main-\ntaining their respective interspike interval histograms), to generate a dis-\ntribution for chance coincident firing. From this, we were able estimate\nwhether number of coincident spikes between the pair of neurons results\nfrom random coincidence or from significant, if weak, interactions ( p\u0003\n0.05). To test the significance, we used one-sample t test to compare\nnumber of coincident spikes generated by surrogates with value obtained\nfrom original spike trains.\nTo study spatial volume conduction, spatial second derivative of volt-\nage as a function of distance z and time twas estimated by a second-order\ndifferencing formula (Kloosterman et al., 2001): {[\u0007(z,t)\b\u0007(z \b \fz,t)]\b\n[\u0007(z\r \fz,t)\b\u0007(z,t)]}\/(\fz)\n2, where\u0007(z,t) is the potential value at distance\nz and time t.\fz is spacing between adjacent electrodes, in our case 25\u0001m.\nTo characterize system dynamics and quantify signal complexity, we\nused the Gaussian process entropy rate (GPER) measurement (Palus,\n1997). GPER provides a useful first approximation of the level of com-\nplexity of signals. It can be interpreted as ameasure reflecting the number\nof linearly independent oscillatory modes contained in the analyzed sig-\nnal. GPERwas calculated from signal epochs using the fast Fourier trans-\nform in a window of 1.6 s, shifted through the signal by a step of 0.2 s. A\nmore detailed description of themethod can be found in the supplemen-\ntal data (available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).\nStatistical analysis was performed using SPSS software (SPSS Inc.).\nGroup comparisons were tested using t tests or Mann\u2013Whitney tests.\nNormal distribution was evaluated by the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test.\nTemporal profiles and trends were analyzed using the general linear\nmodel (GLM). Results in text and graphswere expressed asmean\u000e SEM.\nResults\nSeizure activity\nAfter perfusion with low-calcium ACSF for\u000160 min, slices gen-\nerated repeated spontaneous field bursts (Fig. 1A) that consisted\nof a negative shift in DC potential with superimposed population\nspikes (Fig. 1B). The mean duration of field bursts was 17.3 \u000e\n0.5 s (n\u0006 200, 40 slices), and they recurred with amean interictal\ninterval of 46.6\u000e 1.4 s (n\u0006 200, 40 slices). Their appearance was\nsimilar to those reported previously (Jefferys and Haas, 1982;\nHaas and Jefferys, 1984; Konnerth et al., 1986). The seizures\ncould start in any part of CA1 (supplemental Fig. 2, available at\nwww.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Seizure onset\nzones could change within individual slices, and sometimes sei-\nzures started simultaneously in different parts of CA1. If CA1was\ncut into minislices each containing\u00022 mm of CA1 (supplemen-\ntal Fig. 2D, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental ma-\nterial), they maintained the ability to generate seizures with\nmultifocal onset (10 slices). Seizures could be preceded by pre-\nbursts, an activity resembling seizures aborted shortly after onset\n(supplemental Fig. 3, available at www.jneurosci.org as supple-\nmental material).\nDynamics of high-frequency network activity during\ninterictal period\nDuring the periods between seizures, low-amplitude (\u0003400 \u0001V)\nirregular activity was present throughout CA1 (Fig. 1C). This\nactivity was composed of low-amplitude HFA (Fig. 1D,E) with\nsuperimposed multiunit activity (Fig. 1F). Digital filtering re-\nvealed substantial activity in the band 80\u2013250 Hz (Fig. 1E). This\nhigh-frequency activity changed dynamically during the interic-\ntal period and in the run-up to the next seizure (Fig. 2). The\nbandpass filtered signal, wavelet spectrogram, and summated\npower all show progressive increases inHFA centered on 186\u000e 2\nHz (Fig. 2C\u2013E, respectively, calculated for the recording shown in\nA, B). The increase in power in the 80\u2013250 Hz band is consistent\nwhen averaged across 21 slices, revealing an asymmetrical\nU-shaped profile (Fig. 2F,G, respectively, showing power in real\ntime and in interictal segment in which we divided each interictal\nperiod into 100 equal segments). HFA power rapidly declined to\naminimumduring the first few seconds after the previous seizure\nand then progressively increased during most of the period be-\ntween seizures, reaching a peak immediately before the start of\nFigure 1.

Neurosci., April 21, 2010 \u2022 30(16):5690\u20135701 Jiruska et al. \u2022 Dynamics of Preictal State\nthe next seizure (Fig. 2F,G) (10.9 times minimum; n \u0006 20; p \u0003\n0.001, GLM). At the onset of the seizure, HFA transformed to\nhigh-amplitude low-frequency regular ictal discharges.\nPart way through this progressive increase in power, \u00020.5\nthrough the interictal period, the central frequency of HFA\nstarted to decrease (characterized by first moment or median)\n(Fig. 2H, I) and progressively slowed until just before the seizure\nwhen the rate of slowing increased much more rapidly and in\nparallel with the rapid increase in power. Themean frequency (or\nfirst moment) of the power spectra progressively decreased from\n309\u000e 9 to 231\u000e 9 Hz (Fig. 2H) (n\u0006 21) immediately preceding\nthe seizure; a similar profile of the first moment of frequency was\nseen in individual interictal periods (Fig. 2E, dashed lines). The\nmedian frequency followed a similar course, decreasing from\n229\u000e 11 to 158\u000e 10 Hz (Fig. 2 I) (n\u0006 21) at seizure onset. The\ndecreases in these values suggest that, preceding the seizure, the\ncomposition of HFA shifts toward lower frequencies, but these\nremain within the HFA band. The overall increase in power was\naccompanied by an increase in the amplitude of HFA cycles (Fig.\n2C). The progressive increase in the amplitudewas reflected by an\nincrease of the ratio between the number of 7 and 5 SD cycles,\nfrom a baseline of 0.46 \u000e 0.03 to 0.69 \u000e 0.03 immediately pre-\nceding the seizure (n\u0006 9; p\u0003 0.001, t test) (Fig. 2 J,K).\nTo examine the dynamics of interictal HFA, phase space tra-\njectories were constructed in three-dimensional phase space\nusing original and time-shifted variables x(t), x(t\r \n), and x(t\r\n2\n), where \n is fixed time lag (1ms) (Fig. 3C\u2013F). During seizures,\nthe trajectory pattern was regular and resembled a noisy three- or\nmore dimensional limit cycle (Fig. 3F). The phase space trajec-\ntory during interictal periods had more irregular (complex) pat-\nterns (Fig. 3C,D). The progressive increase in signal amplitude\npreceding the seizurewas associatedwith a progressive expansion\nof the trajectory in phase space (Fig. 3C\u2013E). Transition to seizure\n(Fig. 3E) was characterized by a sudden and rapid expansion in\nphase space reflecting a sudden increase in signal amplitude, as-\nsociatedwith an increase in regularity (decrease in complexity) of\nthe phase space trajectory.\nTo quantify and describe discrete changes in dynamical sys-\ntem complexity, signals were analyzed using GPER (Palus, 1997).\nThis is an entropic measure that measures system complexity,\nunderstood as the number of different oscillatory processes mak-\ning up the time series (Fig. 3G,H). High values reflect large num-\nbers of processes, whereas low values indicate smaller numbers of\nprocesses creating the time series. It showed that mean GPER\nbetween seizures was 1.763 \u000e 0.001 (n \u0006 30; 10 slices). During\nthe seizure, the complexity of the system was significantly lower\nthan during the interictal period (Fig. 3G,I). Ictal values of the\nGPER were 1.21 \u000e 0.02 (n \u0006 30; 10 slices; p \u0003 0.001). Discrete\nchanges in system complexity were observed between seizures. As\nthe next seizure approached, values of GPER progressively and\nFigure 2. Temporal profile of HFA. A, Example of period between seizures (DC removed,\nhigh-pass\u000110 Hz filter).

The increase\npower starts\u000130 s before the seizure. After the end of the seizure, HFA occurs and quickly\ndecreases in power.G, Because the period between seizures in each slice is not equal, interictal\nperiods were each divided into 100 epochs of equal length, and the mean values of summated\npower for individual epochs was obtained. H, I, First moment (H) and median (I) of power\nspectra show that buildup inHFA is accompaniedbyprogressive drop in frequency,with sudden\ndrop immediately preceding the seizure.

Preceding the seizure, there is increase in number of\u00015 and\u00017 SDoscillations, but the\nsteeper increase in\u00017 SD suggests also an increase in amplitude of the HFA preceding the\nseizure (period between seizures divided into 10 segments). K, Ratio between numbers of\u00017\nand\u00015 SD cycles reveal an increase in cycles with higher amplitude.\nJiruska et al. \u2022 Dynamics of Preictal State J. Neurosci., April 21, 2010 \u2022 30(16):5690\u20135701 \u2022 5693\nsignificantly decreased (Fig. 3G,H) ( p\u0003 0.001, GLM, n\u0006 30; 10\nslices). Seizure onset was characterized by a substantial and sig-\nnificant drop in GPER (Fig. 3G,I) ( p \u0003 0.001, t test; n \u0006 30; 10\nslices). The low GPER values persisted throughout the course of\neach seizure.\nHFA spatial profile and synchronization on a local scale\nWe studied the spatial and synchrony profiles of HFA on both\nlocal and global scales. For the analysis at the local scale, record-\nings were performed with electrodes spaced at 25 \u0001m (Fig. 4).\nBuildup of HFAwas present in all recording electrodes (Fig. 4A).\nEstimation of phase synchronization between all pairs of elec-\ntrodes and subsequent randommatrix analysis showed that HFA\ngenerates local areas of synchrony (Fig. 4C). Amaximumof three\nindependent statistically significant ( p \u0001 0.01) synchronization\nclusters could be observed at a time (Fig. 4C). Therefore, we used\nthe first three synchronization indices to determine the mean\nstrength of synchronization of three largest clusters between sei-\nzures. Their values were 0.165 \u000e 0.004, 0.091 \u000e 0.002, and\n0.021\u000e 0.001.\nTransition to seizure was characterized by sudden spatial ex-\npansion of synchrony (n \u0006 24, 8 slices). This expansion was a\nfocal process with one of the clusters expanding (Fig. 4D) and\nmergingwith adjacent clusters. Themean global synchrony index\n(GSI) at seizure onset was 0.46\u000e 0.03 (seven slices), significantly\ndifferent from interictal values ( p \u0003 0.001, t test). During sei-\nzures, expansion proceeded and the strength of synchrony fur-\nther increased until the whole recorded area generated highly\nsynchronous activity (mean GSI, 0.61 \u000e 0.02; seven slices) (Fig.\n4E,G). During seizures, periods of activity were observed during\nwhich the entire area acted as one hypersynchronous ictal cluster\n(maximum GSI, 0.88\u000e 0.03; seven slices).\nWe tested the hypothesis that the spatial structure in the HFA\nsimply reflected passive volume conduction from a very local\nsource. Passive volume conduction would result in a 0 s spatial\nderivative of voltage; this is the basis of current source density\nanalysis in which significant values of this measure are inter-\npreted in terms of currents passing between the intracellular and\nextracellular spaces. The second spatial derivative of voltage\nalong the pyramidal layer showed substantial values (Fig. 4C,D),\nwhich shows that the structure of HFA is not attributable to\npassive decay but rather is the consequence of local activity. Even\nafter seizure onset, when thewhole ofCA1becomes phase locked,\nthe second derivative reveals current sinks and sources along the\npyramidal layer, associated with the propagating population\nspikes (Fig. 4E).\nThe first synchronization index shows the largest synchrony\ncluster, which therefore is used as a measure of global synchroni-\nzation to estimate the total amount of synchrony in the studied\narea. The mean GSI between seizures was 0.165\u000e 0.004 (n\u0006 30;\n10 slices) (Fig. 4B). The temporal profile of the GSI index had a\nU-shape during the interictal period (Fig. 4F) ( p\u0003 0.001, GLM).\nThis increase in synchrony ran in parallel with increase in ampli-\ntude of HFA and its spatial extent (Fig. 4H).\nHFA spatial profile and synchronization on a global scale\nRecording with a wider interelectrode separation of \u0002200 \u0001m\n(17 slices) between seizures showed that the buildup in HFA\noccurs over the entire CA1 region (Fig. 5A). However, HFA did\nnot synchronize between electrodes; no synchrony clusters were\nobserved in the synchronization matrix during interictal HFA\n(Fig. 5C). The mean GSI recorded between seizures with the\nwidely spaced electrodes was 0.009\u000e 0.0004 (n\u0006 30; 10 slices),\nFigure 3. Preictal and ictal changes in Gaussian process entropy rate.

Neurosci., April 21, 2010 \u2022 30(16):5690\u20135701 Jiruska et al. \u2022 Dynamics of Preictal State\nsignificantly smaller than from recordings with closely spaced\nelectrodes ( p \u0001 0.001, Mann\u2013Whitney test) (Fig. 5F). Areas of\nincreased synchrony were detected at the end of prebursts, which\npreceded the seizure and\/or at the initial parts of seizure (0.12\u000e\n0.01; n \u0006 36; 12 slices) (Fig. 5D). As each seizure progresses,\nsynchrony spreads to adjacent regions, ultimately entraining the\nwhole of CA1 (Fig. 5E). In cases with simultaneous onsets at\neither end of CA1, the resulting two large seizure clusters merged\nto cover the whole of CA1. The mean seizure synchrony index\nwas 0.4 \u000e 0.02. During the advanced stages of the seizure, the\nentire CA1 region could be involved in ictal activity and behaved\nas a single cluster of hypersynchronous activity (Fig. 5E,G). Then\nGSI reached its maximal value (0.78 \u000e 0.03; n \u0006 36; 12 slices)\n(Fig. 5E,G).\nCellular mechanisms of high-frequency network activity\nWe investigated neuronal behavior during HFA by isolating 247\ncells from tetrode recordings. Of these, we were able to reliably\ndifferentiate 87 pyramidal cells and 27 interneurons (Fig. 6). The\nremaining cells were either unclassifiable or were \u201csilent\u201d pyra-\nmidal cells, which fired fewer than 500 action potentials over the\nrecording period of\u000215 min. Pyramidal cells fired single action\npotentials (mean width, 0.57\u000e 0.02ms) or short bursts of action\npotentials with mean firing rate 4.0\u000e 0.7 Hz (Fig. 6A,C). Inter-\nneurons fired trains of action potentials (meanwidth, 0.37\u000e 0.03\nms) or could also fire single action potentials with a mean firing\nfrequency of 15.1\u000e 2.6 Hz (Fig. 6B,D). Cross-correlograms be-\ntween spike trains and HFA cycles showed that pyramidal cells\nincreased firing robustly during HFA cycles, whereas interneuro-\nnal activity was only slightly increased (Fig. 6E,F). To quantify\nthe firing probability, phase histograms were calculated (Fig.\n6G,H). All pyramidal cells showed statistically significant in-\ncrease of their spike timing in relation toHFAcycle (Rayleigh test,\np \u0003 0.05; n \u0006 87), as did interneurons (n \u0006 27). Pyramidal cell\nfiring probability peaked during the trough of HFA cycle with\nmean angle of firing 175\u000e 4\u00b0, overlapping the trough minimum\nat 180\u00b0. The mean intensity in increase of pyramidal cell firing\nprobability in relation to HFA cycle was 0.49 \u000e 0.02. The mean\nintensity of increase in firing probability of interneurons was\n0.19 \u000e 0.02, significantly lower than that of pyramidal neurons\n( p\u0003 0.001, t test); the mean phase angle of the firing probability\npeak was 197\u000e 8\u00b0. Although the activity of both pyramidal cells\nand interneurons increases during HFA cycles, the firing proba-\nbility and firing rates of both classes shared an important feature:\nthat none of the cells fired during every HFA cycle.\nFigure 4. Synchrony profile of HFA and seizures on a local scale. A, Recording with closely\nspaced electrodes (25\u0001m). Period between seizures is characterized by the presence of HFA in\nall channels. Preceding the seizure are two short prebursts (asterisks). B, GSI slightly increases\n4\nduring preictal period. Transient increases can be observed during the prebursts. Seizure onset\nis characterized by a sudden increase in GSI, rising up to 0.9. C, Detail of recording between\nseizures shows HFA present in all channels (i). Phase-synchronization matrix (ii) shows two\nstatistically significant clusters ( p\u0003 0.01). Synchronization indices for the individual clusters\nare 0.18 and 0.09. Synchronization index of largest cluster corresponds to GSI. Second spatial\nderivative of voltage shows the presence of several local sinks (iii). D, Seizure onset is charac-\nterized by expansion of one of the clusters and coalescence with adjacent ones. GSI is 0.38.\nSecond derivative of voltage shows expansion and spread of local sinks. E, Seizure activity is\ncharacterized by high-amplitude low-frequency activity during which whole recorded area\ngenerates activity synchronously and creates one large hypersynchronous cluster. GSI reaches\n0.83. Note the continuous current sinks and sources propagating across the area of recording.\nF, G, Values of GSI between seizures (F) and during seizures (G). There is a modest, but signifi-\ncant, progressive increase in synchrony duringpreictal period.H, Preictal changes characterized\nby increase in amplitude are associated also with increased spatial extent (averaged HFA from\ninterictal period divided into 5 segments).\nJiruska et al. \u2022 Dynamics of Preictal State J. Neurosci., April 21, 2010 \u2022 30(16):5690\u20135701 \u2022 5695\nCellular behavior, and correlating multiunit activity with\nHFA, suggested that individual HFA cycles are attributable to\ncofiring of more than two neurons (Fig. 1D\u2013F) (supplemental\nFig. 4, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).\nTherefore, we examined coupling between neuronal firing.\nCross-correlation analyses did not demonstrate the presence of\nclear coupling between pairs of neurons. Therefore, we examined\nthe existence ofweak coupling using a coincidence approach (Fig.\n6 I). Firing coincidence was determined in 5 ms time windows.\nFor each pair of trains, we generated 200 surrogates with shuffled\nspikes to estimate chance levels of coincident firing. Analyses of\n1354 pairs of neurons from single tetrode data identified poten-\ntially significant coincident firing in 54 pairs (4%) of neurons,\nusing a criterion of fewer than 10 of the 200 surrogates having\nmore coincident firings than the real data. A sample of pairs not\nmeeting this criterion showed that the observed incidence of co-\nincident firing was not significantly different from the surrogate\ndata. More detailed analysis of the 54 pairs that did reach crite-\nrion revealed that, in all cases, the observed coincident firing rate\nwas significantly different from that for the population of surro-\ngates ( p \u0003 0.001, one-sample t test), showing that the modest\nincidence of coincident firing was not attributable to chance.\nDuring interictal periods (such as that shown in Fig. 6 J\u2013M),\nunit firing accelerated or, in some cases, postictally silent units\nwere recruited, as the next seizure approached. This applied to\nboth pyramidal cells and interneurons (Fig. 6M). To determine\nthe overall dynamics of neuronal firing during interictal periods,\nwe averaged the firing rate for each of 10 equal segments per\ninterictal period for a total of 24 interictal periods from eight\nslices. This revealed a slowing during the early interictal period\njust after the previous seizure, followed by a progressive increase\nin firing rate as the next seizure approached (Fig. 6N): the mean\nmultiunit firing rate increased from a minimum of 32 \u000e 3 Hz\nshortly after the previous seizure to 121 \u000e 18 Hz just before the\nnext (n \u0006 12; p \u0003 0.001, GLM). The asymmetrical U-shape of\nmean unit firing rate during the interictal period resembles the\npattern seen for summated HFA power (Fig. 2E,F), HFA ampli-\ntude (Fig. 2 J,K), and HFA local synchrony (Fig. 4F) and the\ninverted asymmetrical U-shape for GPER (Fig. 3H). We deter-\nmined the correlation between mean unit firing rate and HFA\nsummated power within the 80\u2013250 Hz band and found r \u0006\n0.81\u000e 0.01 (five slices).\nTo examine cellular mechanisms of HFA further, slices were\nperfused with drugs. Synaptic transmission is blocked by the low\nconcentration of Ca2\r in the ACSF (supplemental Fig. 5, avail-\nable at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material), but neuro-\ntransmitter release independent of action potentials and calcium\nentry is possible. Therefore, we applied antagonists of AMPA (20\n\u0001M 2,3-dioxo-6-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[f]quinoxaline-7-\nsulfonamide; n\u0006 4 slices), NMDA (25 \u0001M 5-APV; n\u0006 4 slices),\nand GABAA (20 \u0001M bicuculline methiodide; n\u0006 5 slices) recep-\ntors. None of the drugs applied blocked HFA. Application of\ngap-junction blockers [0.25\u20130.5 mM octanol (n \u0006 7 slices), 0.2\nmM carbenoxolone (n \u0006 4 slices)] did not suppress HFA either.\nDecreasing the extracellular space by perfusing slices with hypo-\nosmolar ACSF (both 40 and 90mOsm below control osmolarity)\nincreased amplitude of HFA cycles (n\u0006 4 slices).\nFigure 5.

Neurosci., April 21, 2010 \u2022 30(16):5690\u20135701 Jiruska et al. \u2022 Dynamics of Preictal State\nTransition to seizure\nPreictal changes are slow and progressive, but transition to\nseizure is a sudden and rapid process associated with massive\namplitude increase, synchrony expansion, and decrease in\nGPER. Seizures could be triggered by applying various exter-\nnal perturbations, such as local application of glutamate (10\nmM glutamate; eight slices) (Fig. 7A), antidromic electrical\nstimulation (four slices), or by application of electric fields\n(four slices) (Fig. 7B\u2013E).\nApplication of electric fields showed a time-dependent sensi-\ntivity of the CA1 area to applied fields. Fields of various strengths\n(\b2,\b4,\b8,\b10,\b20,\b40, and\b60 V\/m) were applied dur-\ning the periods between seizures. Long after the previous seizure\nand immediately preceding the next expected seizure, weak fields\n(\b4 V\/m) reliably triggered seizure activity ( p\u0003 0.05, t test; n\u0006\n8; 4 slices) (Fig. 7B,C); in some cases, fields as weak as \b2 V\/m\nwere able to trigger seizures. Fields were applied repetitively dur-\ning the interictal period until the next seizure (Fig. 7D). The\nFigure 6. Cellular mechanisms of HFA and dynamics of cellular firing.

Fields applied shortly after the previous\nseizure needed to be strong (stronger than \b40 V\/m) to trigger\npersistent seizure activity (Fig. 7E). From these data, we calcu-\nlated sensitivity S for five segments of interictal period, using the\nfollowing formula: S \u0006 (field evoking seizure)\/(fields evoking\nseizure \r fields failing) * 100. This measure showed that sensi-\ntivity to applied fields increases linearly preceding the seizure\n( p\u0003 0.001, GLM) (Fig. 7G), an increase that suggests a progres-\nsive increase in excitability of CA1 area.\nHFA buildup in high-potassium model\nTo examine whether preseizure changes (buildup inHFA) can be\nobserved in a model in which synaptic activity is intact, we re-\ncorded fromCA1 in slices perfused with high-potassium (8.5mM\nKCl) ACSF. CA1 was isolated from CA3 input by a cut. After\nperfusion with high-potassium ACSF for\u000120 min, isolated CA1\ngenerated repeated, spontaneous seizures (Fig. 8A), characterized\nby repeated epileptiform discharges (Jensen and Yaari, 1988).\nThe mean duration of field bursts was 12.4 \u000e 0.7 s (n \u0006 29, 6\nslices), and they recurredwith amean interictal interval of 40.3\u000e\n2.0 s (n \u0006 28, 6 slices). During the periods between seizures,\nlow-amplitude activity was present throughout the CA1 (Fig.\n8B). This activity was characterized by the presence of HFA (Fig.\n8C) with superimposed multiunit activity (Fig. 8D). Digital fil-\ntering and spectral analysis revealed that this HFA had frequency\npeaks centered at 217 \u000e 7 Hz (n \u0006 23, 6 slices). This high-\nfrequency activity had similar features (morphology and shape)\ntoHFA observed in the low-calciummodel. The temporal profile\nshowed that HFA in the high-potassiummodel changed dynam-\nically throughout the interictal period and progressively built up\nin the run-up to the next seizure, again like the low-calcium\nmodel (Fig. 8E,F). Digital filtering (Fig. 8F), spectrograms (Fig.\n8G), and summated power (Fig. 8H) for the frequency band\n80\u2013250 Hz all showed progressive linear increases as the next\nseizure approached (n\u0006 48, 16 slices; just before the next seizure\nsummated power reached 25.8\u000e 3.1 times its minimum; GLM,\np \u0003 0.001) Progressive buildup was associated with decrease in\nthe spectral first moment from 321\u000e 5 to 251\u000e 4 Hz immedi-\nately preceding seizure (GLM, p\u0003 0.001) (Fig. 8 I). At the onset of\nthe seizure, HFA transformed from low-amplitude HFA to high-\namplitude low-frequency seizure discharges.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we showed complex dynamics of the preictal state in\ntwo models of epileptic seizures. In both cases, this preictal state\nwas characterized by buildup of HFA. Our detailed data on the\nlow-calciummodel suggest that individual cycles ofHFA are gen-\nerated mainly by action potential firing of CA1 pyramidal cells\nwith a small but significant contribution from interneurons. The\nwidth and shape of individual cycles and the width and shape of\nextracellular action potentials suggest that each HFA cycle repre-\nsents population phenomenon during which a small group of\nneurons (2\u201310 cells) generates action potentials simulta-\nneously during a time window of\u00025 ms. Analysis of the firing\nof pairs of units recorded with single tetrodes revealed that a\nminority of neuron pairs did indeed fire within 5 ms of each\nother more often than chance. Analysis of spatial synchrony\nsuggests that HFA cycles are generated by multiple and inde-\npendent local (\u0003130 \u0001m) neuronal populations distributed\nacross the entire CA1. A key question is what are the mecha-\nnisms leading to near-simultaneous cofiring of such small\nneuronal populations?\nThe absence of synaptic transmission in the low-calcium\nmodel suggests that the mechanisms involved in generating HFA\nmust be predominantly nonsynaptic (Haas and Jefferys, 1984;\nKonnerth et al., 1986). Two conditions are necessary for the gen-\neration ofHFA in thismodel. The first is the presence of increased\nneuronal firing. Pyramidal cells and interneurons become hyper-\nactive and spontaneously generate action potentials, following\nthe experimental manipulation of decreasing extracellular cal-\ncium and increasing extracellular potassium. In contrast, CA1\ncells in normal hippocampal slice conditions very rarely fire\nspontaneously.\nFigure 7. Sensitivity to external perturbations.

Neurosci., April 21, 2010 \u2022 30(16):5690\u20135701 Jiruska et al. \u2022 Dynamics of Preictal State\nThe second necessary condition for generating HFA is a\nmechanism enabling action potential cofiring with the \u00025 ms\ntime span. Currently, there are two known nonsynaptic mecha-\nnisms capable of achieving such fast synchronization of firing: (1)\ninteraction via gap junctions between pyramidal cells (Draguhn\net al., 1998; Schmitz et al., 2001), and (2) local electric field or\nephaptic interactions (Jefferys, 1995). Both mechanisms have\nbeen implicated in HFA (Draguhn et al., 1998; Grenier et al.,\n2003; Foffani et al., 2007).However, the persistence ofHFA in the\npresence of gap-junction blockers in our experiments, together\nwith the enhancement of HFA by decreasing extracellular space,\nsupports the role of ephaptic mechanisms. In this mechanism,\nthe electric field generated around cells when they fire can excite\nadjacent cells, especially if they are close to threshold as they are in\nthe low-calcium model. This mechanism requires close proxim-\nity between cells and is helped by their parallel anatomical orga-\nnization. SomeCA1 interneurons are known to share orientation\nand location with CA1 pyramidal cells, which may explain why\nsome interneurons increased their firing during the HFA cycle.\nNo neurons, whether interneuron or pyramidal cell, fired on\nevery cycle of HFA: rather, the high frequency of HFA is a com-\nposite of low-frequency firing neuronal populations.\nOne of the main findings of the present study is that HFA is a\ndynamic process, with HFA progressively building up and\nstrengthening preceding the seizure. At the cellular level, the in-\ncrease in incidence of HFA corresponds to a gradual increase in\nneuronal excitability reflected as increased individual cell firing\nand the recruitment of silent cells. As seizure onset approaches, the\nneuronal populations generating HFA increase in size, which is re-\nflected by increases in the amplitude of HFA (and hence increase in\npower), with a progressive increase in global synchrony.\nSeizure prediction and EEG analysis in human patients com-\nmonly relies on themeasurement of the system dynamics of elec-\ntrographic data (Litt and Lehnertz, 2002; Mormann et al., 2007).\nSeveral different analytical tools have revealed progressive preic-\ntal changes inmeasures of system dynamics and complexity: cor-\nrelation dimension (Lehnertz and Elger, 1995), Lyapunov\ncoefficient (Iasemidis et al., 1990), Kolmogorov entropy, etc. The\nbiological substrate of these measures is not clear, but they gen-\nerally suggest decreases in complexity of the system preceding the\nseizure. Periods between low-calcium seizures were also associ-\nated with changes in system dynamics, reflected by a decrease in\nGPER. This measure of system complexity is understood to re-\nflect the number of independent oscillatory processes generating\nthe observed time series. In our study, the preictal decrease in\nentropy rate could be explained by progressive expansion of neu-\nronal clusters generating HFA, with a concomitant decrease in\ntheir number.\nAt seizure onset, low-amplitude high-frequency activity very\nrapidly converts into high-amplitude low-frequency ictal dis-\ncharges. We show that this transition is characterized by the spa-\ntial expansion of synchrony and the coalescence of local areas of\nsynchronization. Other evidence shows that seizure generation\nrequires recruitment of critical \u201cminimalmass\u201d of neuronal pop-\nulation (Fox et al., 2007). During the seizure, CA1 behaves as one\nhypersynchronous population of neuronswith an associated dra-\nmatic drop in systems complexity, which confirms that, during\nseizures, the system behaves as a more compact process.\nFigure 8.

Neurosci., April 21, 2010 \u2022 30(16):5690\u20135701 \u2022 5699\nImmediately preceding seizure onset, CA1 is in a highly excit-\nable state susceptible to being recruited into seizure activity and\nsensitive to small perturbations. Application of brief electrical\nfields revealed increased sensitivity to external stimuli. Fields of\n2\u20134 V\/m were capable of triggering seizures. Under normal con-\nditions, these field intensities are harmless: fields 20\u201340 times\nstronger are required to evoke epileptic activity, which does not\npersist beyond the stimulus (Bikson et al., 2004). A variety of\nweak external perturbations can trigger seizures under these con-\nditions (our observations and those of Yaari et al., 1986), as long\nas they have depolarizing and\/or synchronizing actions. These\npreictal states of low seizure threshold will also be susceptible to\nendogenous perturbations, which may provide the actual trigger\nfor the seizure: their diversity would contribute to the unpredict-\nability of seizure initiation.\nBuildup in HFA has been reported, but not investigated in\ndetail, in conditions of intact synaptic activity in both humans\n(Worrell et al., 2004; Khosravani et al., 2009) and experimental\nmodels (Khosravani et al., 2005). The nonsynaptic processes de-\nscribed above remain active in thesemodels but aremodulated by\nsynaptic activity in ways that modify the dynamics of the preictal\nstate (Dzhala and Staley, 2003) and transition to seizure.Nonsyn-\naptic mechanisms are sufficient to cause seizures in synaptic\nmodels, such as slices exposed to elevated potassium, because\nseizures can persist when synaptic activity is pharmacologically\nblocked (Jensen and Yaari, 1988). This is in agreement with our\nobservation that buildup in HFA can be also observed in high-\npotassium model, and HFA shares morphological, spectral, and\ndynamical similarities withHFA observed in low-calciummodel.\nEpileptic seizures appear abruptly at the macroscopic scale,\nbut closer investigation can reveal that the transition from the\nphysiological interictal state to the pathophysiological seizure\nstate is through a preictal period of the kind reported here. Sei-\nzures depend of a wide variety of cellular, molecular, and other\nmechanisms involving modulation of glutamatergic synaptic\ntransmission, failure of inhibition or depolarizing inhibitory po-\ntentials, etc. Such a variety of mechanisms may help explain why\nmany epilepsies are hard to treat pharmacologically by drugs\ntargeting only one mechanism. Moreover, many of these mech-\nanisms depend on, or are promoted by, increased neuronal firing\n(Prince and Wilder, 1967; Traub et al., 1993, 1994, 1995; Staley,\n2004; Wong et al., 2005). The increased and abundant neuronal\nfiring and synchrony preceding seizure onset reported here\nwould engage thosemechanisms. Therefore, suppressing the pre-\nictal state described here would abolish the cascade of changes\nresponsible for transition to seizure, which makes the preictal\nstate the more attractive target for novel treatments than the\nseizures themselves.\nReferences\nAllen PJ, Fish DR, Smith SJ (1992) Very high-frequency rhythmic activity\nduring SEEG suppression in frontal lobe epilepsy.
