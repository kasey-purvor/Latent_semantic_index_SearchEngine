The first are red,\nmorphologically early-type galaxies with little or no cur-\nrent star formation; the remainder are blue, late-type galax-\nies with active star formation. This segregation has been\nknown for a long time; however the superb data from the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey has revealed how surprisingly dis-\ntinct these two populations are, at least in terms of their\ncolours (Strateva et al. 2001; Baldry et al. 2003). This seg-\nregation is known to be strongly mass-dependent, with the\nmost massive galaxies being predominantly red, early-types\n(Kauffmann et al. 2003). It is currently unclear whether\ngalaxy evolution at the present day consists of galaxies\nchanging from one type to another in a short time, or of\nevolution in properties within a given class.\nDirect evidence of galaxy evolution comes from obser-\nvations of galaxies at different redshifts; this shows that, in\nthe past, the average star formation rate (SFR) was much\nhigher (Lilly et al. 1996; Madau et al. 1996; Wilson et al.\n2002), and the typical star-forming galaxy was more lumi-\nnous (Cowie et al. 1999). Given the near-constancy of the\nSFR in the Milky Way (e.g. Rocha-Pinto et al. 2000), it\nseems likely that this downsizing effect is the main char-\nacteristic of the decline in global star formation: the most\nmassive galaxies have recently stopped forming stars alto-\ngether, while less massive galaxies continue unhindered.\nA more indirect form of evolution is observed as the\nchange in galaxy populations as a function of their environ-\nment at a given epoch. In particular, galaxies in dense en-\nvironments (i.e. clusters) tend to have early-type morpholo-\ngies (e.g. Dressler 1980; Domi\u00b4nguez et al. 2001; Treu et al.\n2003) and low SFRs (Balogh et al. 1997; Balogh et al.\n1998; Benson et al. 2000; Poggianti et al. 1999). One in-\nterpretation of this trend has been that the cluster en-\nvironment causes galaxies to transform their properties\nas they move, pulled by gravity, from low density re-\ngions into the cluster centre. However, recent work (e.g.\nPimbblet et al. 2002; O\u2019Hely 2000; Kodama et al. 2001),\nespecially that based on the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Sur-\nvey (2dFGRS, Mateus & Sodre\u00b4 2003; Lewis et al. 2002a,\nhereafter Paper I) and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS,\nGomez et al. 2003, hereafter Paper II) has shown that the\ncorrelation between galaxy type and local density extends to\nvery low densities, well beyond the region where the cluster\nis expected to have much influence. These works showed that\nthere is a smooth dependence of SFR on local galaxy density,\nand identified a \u201ccritical\u201d surface density of 1 Mpc\u22122, where\nSFR correlations with environment first occur. This critical\ndensity is quite low, and corresponds to regions well out-\nside the virialised cluster region; this suggests that galaxies\nmay be pre-processed in groups, before they end up in clus-\nters. This had been anticipated (e.g. Zabludoff & Mulchaey\n1998, 2000), since galaxy-galaxy interactions are known to\ninduce star formation (e.g. Barton et al. 2000; Lambas et al.\n2002) and such interactions should be common in groups.\nThere is evidence that these interactions lead to the build-\nup of elliptical galaxies with hot X-ray halos which will later\nbe incorporated into clusters (e.g. Ponman & Bertram 1993;\nMulchaey & Zabludoff 1999; Smith et al. 2003). Groups are\nalso expected to be important because they are the first level\nof the super-galactic hierarchy. Models of galaxy formation\nassume the rate at which gas falls onto a galaxy depends on\nits environment (e.g. Cole et al. 2000; Hernquist & Springel\n2003). In these models, satellite galaxies do not have their\nown supply of hot gas to replenish gas in the disk used to\nform stars. Thus, star formation will gradually decline in\nany galaxy which is part of a larger halo (Balogh et al. 2000;\nDiaferio et al. 2001); groups will be the first environment to\ndemonstrate this effect.\n1.1 Previous Work\nOur understanding of galaxies in groups and lower density\nenvironments has been hindered by the difficulties in obtain-\ning large, unbiased samples. Most of the work has been re-\nstricted to compact groups (e.g. Hickson 1982; Rubin et al.\n1991; Iglesias-Pa\u00b4ramo & V\u0131\u00b4lchez 1999; Coziol et al. 2000;\nNishiura et al. 2000; Verdes-Montenegro et al. 2001;\nde la Rosa et al. 2001; Kelm & Focardi 2003), which are\nmost likely to be physically bound systems. However, these\nmay be a special class of group, not representative of a\ntypical stage of the hierarchy through which most galaxies\nevolve.\nPostman & Geller (1984) analysed the morphology-\ndensity relation in groups selected from the CfA redshift\nsurvey (Geller & Huchra 1983) and demonstrated that the\noriginal relation found in clusters by Dressler (1980) ex-\ntends continuously to lower densities. Below a density of \u223c 1\nMpc\u22123 (MB(0) < \u221217.5) no further correlation is seen. Simi-\nlar trends have since been confirmed in numerous other stud-\nies (e.g. Zabludoff & Mulchaey 1998; Hashimoto & Oemler\n1999; Tran et al. 2001; Treu et al. 2003) . Interestingly,\nPostman & Geller (1984) found the trend with local density\nis the same in both rich clusters and poor groups; the only\ndifference is that poor groups typically sample lower den-\nsity regions and, thus, have populations more dominated by\nlate-type galaxies. It has been argued based on this evidence\nthat galaxy-galaxy interactions within the group environ-\nment are the mechanism responsible for the high fractions\nof early-type galaxies in clusters (e.g. Zabludoff & Mulchaey\n1998, 2000; Hashimoto & Oemler 2000).\nLess work has been done on the stellar populations of\ngroup galaxies, though there is good evidence that they\nare intermediate between those of the field and rich clus-\nters (Allington-Smith et al. 1993; Hashimoto et al. 1998;\nGirardi et al. 2002; Tran et al. 2001; Carlberg et al. 2001).\nMore recently, analysis of SFRs in galaxy groups selected\nfrom the partially-completed 2dFGRS survey has been done\nby Mercha\u00b4n & Zandivarez (2002). Based on this group cat-\nalogue, Mart\u00b4\u0131nez et al. (2002) found that even the lowest-\nmass groups, with masses \u223c 1013M\u2299 show reduced total\nSFRs relative to the field. Dom\u0131\u00b4nguez et al. (2002) claim\nthat the spectral-type dependence on local density is only\nobserved in groups more massive than 3\u00d71013M\u2299; however,\nthis claim appears to arise mostly from the fact that their\nlow-mass groups do not sample densities as high as found in\nthe higher-mass groups.\n1.2 The purpose of this paper\nWe analyse the local correlation between star-formation\nactivity and environment using data obtained from the\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nGalaxy ecology in SDSS and 2dFGRS 3\ntwo largest galaxy surveys every conducted: the 2dFGRS\n(Colless et al. 2001, 2003) and the SDSS (York et al. 2000).\nIn particular, we have selected a sample of galaxy groups\nfrom each survey, but in significantly different ways. Since\nthe definition of a group is partly subjective, and a variety\nof algorithms have been developed to find groups in redshift\nsurveys, comparing results from the two catalogues allows\nus to investigate the sensitivity of our results to the way the\ngroup catalogue is constructed.\nThe purpose of this paper is to establish how star forma-\ntion in the galaxy population, as characterised by the distri-\nbution of H\u03b1 emission, depends on environment. Specifically,\nwe will investigate whether the most important variable is 1)\nvelocity dispersion of the embedding group or cluster; 2) lo-\ncal galaxy density, on scales <\u223c 1 Mpc; or 3) large-scale struc-\nture, as parameterised by the density on \u223c 5 Mpc scales. We\nwill show that the number of actively star-forming galaxies\ndepends on both the local and large-scale density, but that\nthe properties of the star-forming galaxies themselves do\nnot.\nA summary of the paper follows. In Section 2 we de-\nscribe the details of the two datasets analysed herein, focus-\ning on the construction of group catalogues, measurement\nof emission line strengths, and sample selection. Our results\nare presented in Section 3. We discuss the physical implica-\ntions of our results in Section 4, and draw some conclusions\nin Section 5. Throughout the paper we use a cosmology of\n\u2126m = 0.3, \u2126\u039b = 0.7 and H0 = 100h km s\n\u22121Mpc\u22121, with\nh = 0.7. All distances are proper lengths in units of Mpc.\n2 DATA\nWe will use local data gleaned from the two largest redshift\nsurveys ever conducted: the 2dFGRS (Colless et al. 2001,\n2003) and the SDSS (York et al. 2000). Below we summarise\nthe data in each survey, and describe our group catalogues,\nemission line measurements, and sample selection criteria.\n2.1 The 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey\n2.1.1 Summary of the data\nThe 2dFGRS has obtained over 220 000 spectra of galaxies\nselected in the photographic bJ band, from the APM galaxy\ncatalogue. The targeted galaxies are located in two con-\ntiguous declination strips, plus 99 randomly located fields.\nOne strip is in the southern Galactic hemisphere and cov-\ners approximately 80\u25e6 \u00d7 15\u25e6 centred close to the SGP. The\nother strip is in the northern Galactic hemisphere and cov-\ners 75\u25e6 \u00d7 10\u25e6. The 99 random fields are located over the\nentire region of the APM galaxy catalogue in the southern\nGalactic hemisphere outside of the main survey strip. We\nonly use the contiguous fields for this work. Full details of\nthe survey strategy are given in Colless et al. (2001).\nThe survey spectra were obtained through \u223c 2\u2032\u2032 fibres,\nand cover the wavelength range 3600\u20138000A\u02da at 9A\u02da resolu-\ntion. Only the wavelength range of 3600\u20137700A\u02da is used dur-\ning the line fitting procedure due to poor signal to noise\nand strong sky emission in the red part of the spectrum.\nThe wide wavelength range is made possible by the use of\nan atmospheric dispersion compensator (ADC) within the\n2dF instrument (Lewis et al. 2002b). The accuracy of each\nindividual redshift is \u223c 85 km s\u22121 (Colless et al. 2001).\n2.1.2 The group catalogue\nThe group catalogue is based on a friends-of-friends perco-\nlation algorithm, which links neighbouring galaxies together\nif they lie within a specified linking-length of each other\n(Eke et al. 2003). The linking-length is scaled with redshift\nin order to obtain groups of a constant overdensity in the\nmagnitude limited survey. This is done by scaling the length\naccording to n(z)\u22121\/3, where n(z) is the mean galaxy density\nat redshift z. Furthermore, the linking length along the line\nof sight (\u2113||) is allowed to be larger than that in the plane of\nthe sky (\u2113\u22a5), to account for the effects of peculiar velocities.\nThe algorithm is extensively tested on mock catalogues de-\nrived from numerical simulations with \u03c38 = 0.9, so the com-\npleteness and contamination of the catalogue is understood.\nFor details we refer the reader to (Eke et al. 2003); we briefly\nreview the salient points here. The mock galaxy catalogues\nare created using the semi-analytic models of Cole et al.\n(2000), with the 2dFGRS selection function. Groups identi-\nfied from this mock catalogue are then compared with the\ncorresponding \u201ctrue\u201d group, identified as galaxies populat-\ning dark matter halos identified using a friends-of-friends\nalgorithm with a linking length of b = 0.2 times the mean\nparticle separation. The parameters of the group-finding al-\ngorithm are tuned to provide the best match between the\nmedian properties (size and mass) of the observed and true\ngroups. These best-fit parameters are b = \u2113\u22a5n(z)\n1\/3 = 0.13,\nL\u22a5,max = 2h\n\u22121 Mpc and R = 11, where L\u22a5,max is the max-\nimum linking-length permitted across the line of sight and\nR = \u2113||\/\u2113\u22a5. These values are insensitive to \u03c38 for reason-\nable values of the normalisation. Small, parameterised per-\nturbations of b and R are allowed to remove small differ-\nences in the recovered properties that correlate with halo\nmass. The median recovered velocity dispersions are accu-\nrate to better than \u223c 10%, independent of halo mass, when\ncompared with the velocity dispersion of the parent dark\nmatter halo; however, the scatter in this accuracy is large.\nThe catalogue is highly complete, recovering > 95% of ha-\nlos with dark matter mass M <\u223c 4 \u00d7 10\n14 M\u2299; the price\nto be paid is some contamination from unphysical systems.\nFor the most massive haloes, the algorithm is susceptible\nto a small amount of fragmentation; approximately 10% of\nhaloes with M >\u223c 10\n14M\u2299 are fragmented into more than\none group with mass at least 20 per cent that of the parent\ndark matter halo.\nFor each group, we calculate the velocity dispersion us-\ning the gapper estimate of Wainer & Thissen (1976), as dis-\ncussed in Beers et al. (1990), which is insensitive to outliers.\nThe group centre is computed by iteratively rejecting the\nmost distant galaxy until only two galaxies remain; the cen-\ntre is taken to be the position of the brighter of these two\ngalaxies.\n2.1.3 H\u03b1 as a star formation tracer in the 2dFGRS\nThe SFR is directly related to the H\u03b1 emission luminosity\n(e.g. Kennicutt 1983), and we will use this emission line as\nour tracer of star formation. To provide a reliable description\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n4 Balogh et al.\nof SFR, however, H\u03b1 luminosities need to be corrected for\nunderlying absorption, dust extinction, and aperture effects,\nall of which are important (e.g. Charlot & Longhetti 2001;\nHopkins et al. 2001, 2003; Afonso et al. 2003). When these\ncorrections are made, there is good agreement between H\u03b1\u2013\nderived SFRs, and those derived from the far infrared, ra-\ndio or ultra\u2013violet continuum (Hopkins et al. 2003). In this\npaper, however, we will focus only on the rest-frame equiv-\nalent width of the H\u03b1 line, W0(H\u03b1), corrected for underly-\ning absorption (see below). Uniform dust extinction will not\naffect theW0(H\u03b1), though selective extinction around mas-\nsive stars will (Charlot & Longhetti 2001). Aperture correc-\ntions to the flux can be substantial, typically ranging from\na factor \u223c 2 to \u223c 6 (Hopkins et al. 2003); however, the ef-\nfect of this missing flux on W0(H\u03b1) depends on the spatial\ndistribution of the H\u03b1 emission. As long as the size distri-\nbution of galaxies is independent of environment, neglecting\nthis correction does not affect the results of this paper. We\nwill demonstrate that this assumption is justified, in Ap-\npendix A.\nAs described in Paper I, all of the measurements of\nline equivalent widths have been performed using a com-\npletely automatic procedure. In summary, up to 20 individ-\nual absorption and emission lines are fitted simultaneously\nwith Gaussian profiles. The H\u03b1 emission line is accurately\ndeblended from the adjacent [Nii]\u03bb6548A\u02da and [Nii]\u03bb6583A\u02da\nlines; the [Nii] lines are constrained to be in emission while\nthe H\u03b1 line may be either emission or absorption (but not\nboth); measurements are made whether or not the line is\ndetected in emission. We will add 1A\u02da to the H\u03b1 equivalent\nwidths to approximately account for the effects of stellar\nabsorption (Hopkins et al. 2003). This correction is not im-\nportant for galaxies with significant emission, which are of\ninterest here, but ensures that the mean W0(H\u03b1) is never\nmuch less than zero. Because of the uncertain flux calibra-\ntion of the 2dFGRS spectra, we do not derive H\u03b1 luminosi-\nties, or SFRs, but restrict the analysis to the observable\nquantity W0(H\u03b1).\nWe also wish to exclude from the analysis galaxies in\nwhich most of the emission comes from an active galactic nu-\nclei (AGN). Since the flux calibration is not reliable over long\nwavelengths, we just use the criterion [Nii]\u03bb6583\/H\u03b1 > 0.63\nto identify AGN-dominated spectra, when the equivalent\nwidths of both lines are greater than 2 A\u02da (e.g. Miller et al.\n2003). Since the AGN fraction does not appear to correlate\nwith environment, however (Miller et al. 2003), the correc-\ntion does not affect any of the conclusions in this paper.\n2.1.4 Sample selection\nWe select a volume-limited subset of the contiguous fields,\nwhere the lower redshift limit, z > 0.05, is chosen to reduce\nour sensitivity to aperture effects. The upper redshift limit,\nz < 0.095, is chosen because measurement of H\u03b1 emission\nbecomes difficult when it is redshifted beyond \u223c 7200 A\u02da\nand night sky emission lines are strong1. At this redshift,\nthe magnitude limit of the survey (bJ = 19.45) corresponds\n1 In Paper I we used an upper limit of z = 0.1; the small change\nhere is made for consistency with the SDSS sample as presented\nin Paper II and this paper.\nto a k-corrected luminosity of Mb \u2248 \u221219. However, for con-\nsistency with the SDSS sample (see Appendix B), we limit\nthis sample to Mb = \u221219.5, using the average k-correction\nof Norberg et al. (2002). Finally, we exclude galaxies that\nare within 2 Mpc of a survey boundary; more stringent cuts\nare made when computing densities on various scales, as\nappropriate.\nOur final, volume-limited sample contains 20154 galax-\nies. For computations of W0(H\u03b1), we exclude galaxies in\nwhich the continuum was negative, or a Gaussian was a\npoor fit to the line (see Paper I). Furthermore, we restrict\nour analysis to data taken after August 1999, since the ex-\ntreme ends of spectra obtained earlier are severely affected\nby problems with the ADC (Lewis et al. 2002b). These re-\nstrictions reduce the usable sample to 12683 galaxies. Of\nthese, 846 (6.7%) are identified as AGN (see Section 2.1.3)\nand excluded from the sample. This leaves 11837 galaxies, of\nwhich 7012 (59 per cent) are in the friends-of-friends group\ncatalogue; 1577 (13 per cent) are in groups with at least ten\nmembers above the luminosity limit, which we use for our\nanalysis. This latter requirement is made so that meaningful\nestimates of local density can be made. We use the friends-\nof-friends linking algorithm to designate group membership,\nrather than selecting all galaxies within some specified ra-\ndius of a chosen centre. No further selection of the clusters\nis made, and many of the systems are therefore dynamically\nunrelaxed groups, for which the velocity distribution is not a\nreliable indicator of dynamical mass. The velocity dispersion\ndistribution of groups with more than ten bright members\nis shown in Fig. 1. As described in Section 2.1.2, this is de-\nsigned to be a very highly complete catalogue that will still\nhave some contamination from unphysical systems, though\nthis contamination is substantially reduced by our selection\nof groups with at least ten members (Eke et al. 2003).\n2.2 The first SDSS data release\n2.2.1 Summary of the data\nThe SDSS (http:\/\/www.sdss.org) is a joint, 5 passband (u,\ng, r, i, z), imaging and medium\u2013resolution (R \u2243 1800)\nspectroscopic survey of the Northern Galactic Hemisphere\n(see York et al. 2000, for details). In May 2003, the SDSS\npublicly released the first official set of data, named DR1,\nwhich comprises 186,240 spectra of galaxies, stars and\nQSOs over 1360 deg2 of sky. This release is fully described\nin Abazajian et al. (2003), and the reader is referred to\nStrauss et al. (2002) for a detailed description of the spec-\ntroscopic target selection for the SDSS main galaxy survey.\nThe spectra are obtained from 3\u2032\u2032 diameter fibres, larger\nthan those of the 2dFGRS. The spectrographs produce data\ncovering 3800-9200 A\u02da, with the beam split at 6150 A\u02da by a\ndichroic. The spectral resolution at \u03bb \u223c 5000A\u02da is \u223c 2.5A\u02da,\nand redshift uncertainties are \u223c 30 kms\u22121.\n2.2.2 The group catalogue\nGroups are selected from the SDSS in a fundamentally dif-\nferent way from 2dFGRS groups (cf. Section 2.1.2), which\nallows us to test the sensitivity of our results to the group-\nfinding algorithm. The SDSS algorithm (Nichol, Miller et al.\nin prep) is a semi-parametric, high dimensional technique\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nGalaxy ecology in SDSS and 2dFGRS 5\nFigure 1. The histogram shows the abundance of groups with at\nleast ten members in the 2dFGRS sample as a function of velocity\ndispersion, corresponding to the left axis. The solid points are the\naverage number of galaxies (brighter than Mb = \u221219) per group,\nwith values corresponding to the right axis. The error bars span\nthe range from the 10th to 90th percentile of the distribution.\ndeveloped to find galaxies clustered in both position and\ncolour. The premise is that galaxies within clusters evolved\nsimilarly, and thus galaxy clusters contain subsets of galaxies\nthat have similar spectral energy distributions (SED). Note\nthat this is not a red-sequence finder (e.g. Gladders & Yee\n2000), and will detect groups of blue galaxies if they have\nsimilar colours. Galaxy colours are used as a proxy for the\nshape of the SED since they cover a larger wavelength range\nthan the spectra and because the dimensionality of the prob-\nlem is reduced to a manageable 7-d space (position, redshift,\nu \u2212 g, g \u2212 r, r \u2212 i, and i \u2212 z). In practice, we expect clus-\ntering in colour-space to be a signal from the red sequence\n(e.g. Gladders & Yee 2000). Galaxy overdensities in this 7-d\nspace are found by comparing to random locations in the\nSDSS DR1 survey. By design, the algorithm is extremely\npure (i.e. few false positives). This high purity is the re-\nsult of the lack of projection in 7-d space, and the use of\nthe False Discovery Rate statistical method in choosing a\nthreshold above which galaxies are considered clustered (see\nMiller et al. 2001).\nThe algorithm has been tested against mock catalogues\n(Wechsler et al., in prep), in which galaxies are assigned\nr-band magnitudes and placed onto dark matter particles\nin such a way that the luminosity-dependent clustering of\nthe SDSS seen in Blanton et al. (2003a) is matched. The\nremaining magnitudes are then added in so that the corre-\nlation between colour and local density, as observed in the\nSDSS, is also matched. The same cluster-finding algorithm\nused on the real data is then run on the mock catalogues.\nPreliminary tests show that the cluster catalogue is > 90%\ncomplete for clusters with mass M > 2.5 \u00d7 1014M\u2299; the\ncompleteness decreases toward lower masses. The catalogue\nis 100% pure for systems with M > 5\u00d7 1014M\u2299 and always\ngreater than 90% pure (Nichol, Miller et al., in prep.). We\nexclude groups in which the velocity distribution (measured\nusing all galaxies, not only those identified as clustered in\ncolour space) is significantly different from a Gaussian, so\nthat we preferentially select dynamically isolated, relaxed\nsystems. The final catalogue contains 104 bona-fide clusters\nwith reliable velocity dispersions that are likely indicative of\nsystem mass. This catalogue is a good complement to the\n2dFGRS catalogue, as it is a highly pure catalogue (i.e., with\nlittle contamination), at the expense of being incomplete for\nlow-mass groups. All galaxies within 1000 kms\u22121 and twice\nthe virial radius (defined by the galaxy number overden-\nsity relative to the field) of the cluster are considered group\nmembers; the exact radius chosen is not important because\nwe present our data as a function of local density, which\ncorrelates well with radius within the virialised region.\n2.2.3 H\u03b1 as a star formation tracer in the SDSS\nWe will again use the H\u03b1 equivalent width as a tracer\nof star formation, as we have done for the 2dFGRS sam-\nple (see Section 2.1.3). Emission and absorption lines are\nmeasured automatically from the spectra by fitting multi-\nple Gaussians where required. Again a measurement is pro-\nvided for every line, whether or not it was detected in emis-\nsion, and we make a 1A\u02da correction for underlying stellar\nabsorption (Hopkins et al. 2003). The effect of converting\nW0(H\u03b1) to SFR using various conversions (e.g., Kennicutt\n1998; Hopkins et al. 2001; Charlot & Longhetti 2001), were\ndiscussed in Paper II and will not be considered here.\nFor the SDSS spectra we can more effectively ex-\nclude AGN (relative to the 2dFGRS), since the spectra\nare accurately flux calibrated. Here, we will consider the\n[Nii]\u03bb6583\/H\u03b1 and [Oiii]\/H\u03b2 ratios, using the classification\nof Miller et al. (2003). Where possible, all four lines are used\nto identify AGN; if only one of the ratios is available, then\nonly that one is used. Most (87%) of the AGN are identified\nbased on the [Nii]\/H\u03b1 ratio alone.\n2.2.4 Sample selection\nWe will use the same volume-limited sample as in Paper II.\nThe main criteria for selection are 0.05 < z < 0.095 and\nMr < \u221220.6 (k\u2013corrected, for H0 = 70kms\n\u22121Mpc\u22121). As\nfor the 2dFGRS data, the lower redshift limit is imposed\nto minimise aperture bias due to large nearby galaxies (see\nAppendix A for more detail). The upper redshift limit is that\nwhere our luminosity limit equals the magnitude limit of the\nSDSS (r = 17.7; Strauss et al. 2002). From a volume\u2013limited\nsample of 19287 galaxies we exclude 4237 that are within 2\nMpc of a survey boundary, and another 64 galaxies for which\nno reliable measurement of H\u03b1 is available, leaving 14986\ngalaxies. Finally, removing a \u223c 12% AGN contribution we\nhave 13131 galaxies in the final sample. Of these, 1939 (15%)\nare associated with a group in the catalogue.\nIn Fig. 2 we show the velocity dispersion distribution\nfor the selected subset of SDSS groups. The distribution is\nsomewhat flatter than that of the 2dFGRS group (Fig. 1),\nlikely due to the fact that the former catalogue is incom-\nplete at the lowest velocity dispersions, while the latter has\nmore contamination. Furthermore, the SDSS catalogue in-\ncludes a few clusters with very high velocity dispersions,\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n6 Balogh et al.\nFigure 2. As Fig. 1, but for groups in the SDSS sample, restricted\nto groups with at least ten member galaxies brighter than Mr =\n\u221220.6.\n\u03c3 > 800 km s\u22121, while such large systems tend to be frag-\nmented in the 2dFGRS catalogue.\n2.3 Homogeneity of the samples\nIn using the 2dFGRS and SDSS data together, we need to\nensure that the samples are comparable in terms of selec-\ntion and derived measurements. This detailed comparison is\nmade in Appendix B. The only difference relevant to our re-\nsults is that the bJ-selection of the 2dFGRS results in a sam-\nple that is more biased toward galaxies with large W0(H\u03b1)\nthan the r\u2212selected SDSS. Because of this difference, we\nwill show most of our results for the two surveys separately.\nThe final combined sample contains 24968 galaxies and 204\ngroups with at least ten members. Approximately 14% of all\ngalaxies in the sample are associated with a group.\n2.4 Density Estimates\nThe local galaxy number density around a given galaxy is\nnot in itself a well-defined quantity. As can be anticipated\nfrom the shape of the correlation function (e.g. Baugh et al.\n1999), the density of neighbouring galaxies tends to increase\nas you probe closer to the target galaxy (see Appendix C2).\nWe are therefore faced with two choices when characterising\nthe density around a galaxy. One is to measure the density\nwithin a fixed distance scale. This ensures that both high-\nand low-density regions are measured at the same scale; how-\never, the measurement is noisy and of limited dynamic range\ndue to the arbitrarily small, and finite, number of galaxies\nwithin the chosen distance. On the other hand, we can use\na systematically larger scale in lower density regions. This\nimproves sensitivity and precision at low densities, but may\nbe difficult to interpret because high- and low-density envi-\nronments are measured at different physical scales. Without\nprior knowledge of the nature of the relevant physical ef-\nfects, we cannot say which is the more meaningful estimate.\nFor example, if we believe galaxy-galaxy interactions are im-\nportant, then perhaps it is only the distance to the nearest\nneighbour that is relevant (Lambas et al. 2002). It is easy\nto imagine scenarios where either the distance to the Nth\nneighbour, or density measured on a physical scale, is likely\nto be more meaningful.\nIn this paper, we will adopt two density estimators,\nwhich are described in Appendix C. The first is a tradi-\ntional projected density estimate, \u03a35, which is based on\nthe projected distance to the fifth-nearest neighbour within\n\u00b11000 kms\u22121. Inasmuch as we are willing to believe that\ngalaxies can be found in discrete, relatively isolated groups,\nwe must be cautious about interpreting our density estimate\nin groups where the number of members is less five. For a\ngroup with only four members, the fifth nearest neighbour\nwill clearly not lie in the same group and, therefore, the\ndensity computed from this distance may not be what is\nwanted. To ensure that we maintain our intuitive idea of a\nlocal environment within groups, we only consider groups\nwhich have at least ten galaxies brighter than our luminos-\nity limit. Furthermore, we exclude any galaxies in which the\nfifth\u2013nearest neighbour is more distant than the closest sur-\nvey boundary, or within 1000 kms\u22121 of our redshift limits,\nto ensure accurate measurements. This may bias us against\nfinding low-density regions, but does not affect the observed\ntrends of galaxy property with \u03a35 (e.g. Miller et al. 2003).\nThe second estimator is a three-dimensional density \u03c1\u03b8,\nobtained by convolving the galaxy field with a Gaussian of\ndispersion \u03b8. In particular, we will consider the density mea-\nsured on scales \u03b8 = 1.1 and 5.5 Mpc (see Appendix C).\nThese measurements underestimate the density in clusters\nwith large velocity dispersions, but are particularly useful\nfor probing low density regimes where peculiar velocities are\nsmall. The main disadvantage is that the signal-to-noise ra-\ntio varies with density, and is low at low densities, when\nthere are few galaxies within the aperture. In our analysis\nwe will therefore indicate the density at which there is less\nthan one galaxy within the Gaussian dispersion \u03b8, and will\nexclude any galaxies which are located less than 2\u03b8 from a\nsurvey boundary, to avoid biassing the density estimate.\n3 RESULTS\n3.1 Dependence of W0(H\u03b1) on environment\nIn Papers I and II we showed that there is a strong correla-\ntion between W0(H\u03b1) distribution and local galaxy density.\nIn this section we will first define precisely what property\nof the galaxy distribution correlates with environment; then\nproceed to explore how this correlation depends on the def-\ninition of local environment.\n3.1.1 Bimodality in the W0(H\u03b1) distribution\nIn Fig. 3 we present the correlation betweenW0(H\u03b1) and \u03a35\nfor the 2dFGRS and SDSS samples. On the top axis we show\nthe distance to the fifth\u2013nearest neighbour corresponding to\n\u03a35, which shows that at the lowest densities we are mea-\nsuring the galaxy distribution on >\u223c 3 Mpc scales, while in\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nGalaxy ecology in SDSS and 2dFGRS 7\nFigure 3.

The\ntop axis shows the distance to the 5th nearest neighbour, from\nwhich \u03a35 is computed. The solid lines show the median and 75th\npercentile of W0(H\u03b1), in bins of 100 galaxies. Although we only\nplot the data forW0(H\u03b1)< 40A\u02da, they extend toW0(H\u03b1)\u223c 100A\u02da;\nsee Fig. B2 for the full W0(H\u03b1) distributions as histograms.\nthe densest regions the measurement is made at <\u223c 300 kpc.\nRecall (Section 2.4) that we exclude any galaxy for which\nthe fifth\u2013nearest neighbour is more distant than the nearest\nsurvey boundary, or within 1000 kms\u22121 of our redshift lim-\nits. The solid lines show the median and 75th percentile of\nthe W0(H\u03b1) distribution. In both cases, we reproduce the\nresults of Paper I and Paper II; the distribution changes dis-\ntinctly, at a density \u03a35 \u223c 2 Mpc\n\u22122. This is characterised by\nthe near-total lack of galaxies with large W0(H\u03b1) at densi-\nties greater than this value. At lower densities, there remains\na correlation between W0(H\u03b1) and \u03a35; however it is weak,\nwith the average W0(H\u03b1) increasing by only \u223c 25 per cent\nover an order of magnitude in local density. The difference\nin normalisation between the SDSS and 2dFGRS surveys is\ndue to the different selection criteria for the spectroscopic\nsample, as discussed in Appendix B.\nThe W0(H\u03b1) distribution shown in Fig. 3 reveals the\npresence of two distinct galaxy populations: those with sig-\nnificant, ongoing star formation covering a broad range in\nH\u03b1 strength (from \u223c 4A\u02da to > 40A\u02da), and those with no\nongoing star formation, which form a conspicuous horizon-\ntal ridge line about W0(H\u03b1)= 0. (This is more clearly\nseen in Fig. B2, where we show the W0(H\u03b1) distribu-\ntions as histograms). This recalls the bimodality observed in\nthe colour distribution (Strateva et al. 2001; Blanton et al.\n2003b); Baldry et al. (2003) find that the red peak distri-\nbution can be explained as the result of mergers between\ngalaxies in the blue peak. We will therefore base our anal-\nysis on the star-forming population, and its variation with\nenvironment.\nIn Fig. 4 we show the W0(H\u03b1) distribution only for\nthose galaxies with W0(H\u03b1)> 4 A\u02da, in environments with\nFigure 4.

We show\nPoisson-distributed error bars on the high-density subsample,\nwhich is the smaller of the two.\nthe highest and lowest \u03a35 densities. The distributions are\nvery similar; a Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test cannot reject the\nhypothesis that the low- and high-density distributions are\ndrawn from the same population with more than 1\u03c3 confi-\ndence. Any difference, no matter how significant, must be\nsmall: the mean W0(H\u03b1) is \u223c 21.5A\u02da and \u223c 20A\u02da for the low-\nand high-density populations, respectively, in both the 2dF-\nGRS and SDSS samples. Thus, the observed trend of mean\nW0(H\u03b1) with density (Fig. 3) is due almost entirely to the\nrelative proportion of galaxies with W0(H\u03b1)> 4 A\u02da; there is\nat most weak sensitivity to environment within the actively\nstar forming population alone2.\n3.1.2 The abundance of star-forming galaxies\nMotivated by the results of the previous subsection, we show,\nin Fig. 5, how the fraction of galaxies with W0(H\u03b1)> 4\nA\u02da depends on \u03a35. It is evident that the fraction decreases\nsteadily with increasing density; the break at \u03a35 \u223c 2 Mpc\n\u22122\nis still there, but less apparent than in Fig. 3.\nSince the identification of a characteristic density can\nhave important implications, it is useful to understand why\nit appears so strongly in Fig. 3 (and Papers I and II) but\nis much weaker in Fig. 5. Upon close examination, a change\nin slope is most evident in the median of the 2dFGRS, at\n\u03a35 \u223c 1 Mpc\n\u22122, and in the 75th percentile of the SDSS, at\n\u03a35 \u223c 3 Mpc\n\u22122. From Fig. 5 we see that these two densities\ncorrespond to the point at which the fraction of galaxies with\n2 We will not deal directly with the distribution of W0(H\u03b1) in\ngalaxies withW0(H\u03b1)< 4 A\u02da, since this distribution is most likely\ndominated by measurement uncertainties, including systematic\neffects like stellar absorption, rather than star formation activity.\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n8 Balogh et al.\nFigure 5. The fraction of galaxies with W0(H\u03b1)> 4 A\u02da as a func-\ntion of local density for the 2dFGRS (bottom panels) and SDSS\n(top panels) samples. The solid lines represent the full galaxy\nsample, in bins each containing 250 galaxies. The dashed lines\nare restricted to galaxies which lie in groups or clusters with the\nindicated velocity dispersion, in bins of 50 galaxies each. Poisson-\ndistributed uncertainties are typically \u223c 0.1 on the dashed lines\nand \u223c 0.05 on the solid lines.\nW0(H\u03b1)> 4A\u02da drops below 50 (2dFGRS) or 25 (SDSS) per\ncent; at higher densities the median and 75th percentile, re-\nspectively, are tracing the non-star forming population with\nW0(H\u03b1)< 4A\u02da, and the trend with \u03a35 largely disappears.\nIt is worth stressing that the trend with \u03a35 is fairly in-\nsensitive to projection effects, despite the fact that we are\nprojecting over a \u00b114 Mpc cylinder, and despite the nonuni-\nform density of the background, as we demonstrate in Ap-\npendix C1.1. To summarize the results of that Appendix, at\n\u03a35 \u223c 0.1 Mpc\n\u22122, where the projected contamination is \u223c 50\nper cent, we only overestimate the emission-line fraction by\nabout 5 per cent. This is because the emission-line fraction\nvaries weakly with \u03a35 at low densities, so there is little phys-\nical difference between the properties of the target galax-\nies and the projected galaxies. At high \u03a35, the projected\nfraction drops strongly, both because the contrast with the\nfield is increasing, and because the radius of the projected\ncylinder is decreasing. Thus, the observed emission-line frac-\ntion remains within \u223c 5 per cent of the true value, despite\nthe fact that the contrast between the target and projected\ngalaxy populations becomes large. The observed trend with\n\u03a35 is, therefore, a physical one.\nFig. 5 also shows the correlation for galaxies in groups\nof different velocity dispersion. We note that, although ve-\nlocity dispersion gives a good indication of the group mass\non average, there is a significant scatter arising because our\ngroups are not all relaxed, spherical systems. Therefore, the\nvelocity dispersion in some cases will be a better indicator\nof substructure or dynamic state than of mass. The cor-\nrelation of emission-line fraction with density is present in\nboth high- and low-velocity dispersion groups, selected from\neither the SDSS or 2dFGRS. There is marginal evidence\nFigure 6. The fraction of galaxies with W0(H\u03b1)> 4A\u02da in the\nSDSS (dashed line) and 2dFGRS (solid line), as a function of\nthree-dimensional density \u03c11.1, estimated with a Gaussian kernel\nwith 1.1 Mpc standard deviation. Each bin contains 250 galax-\nies. The vertical, dotted line corresponds to the density where\nno galaxy lies within the Gaussian filtering scale \u03b8, making the\ndensity estimate particularly noisy. On the top axis we show the\nestimated two-dimensional projected density within a cylinder of\nlength 2000 km s\u22121, for comparison with \u03a35.\n(particularly in the 2dFGRS sample) that galaxies in the\nhighest-velocity dispersion clusters have a low fraction of\ngalaxies with W0(H\u03b1)> 4A\u02da for their local density, relative\nto galaxies in lower-dispersion groups. Projection will have\na more complex effect on this result, since the physical size\nof the group depends on \u03c3; in particular, we expect the over-\nestimation of both \u03a35 and W0(H\u03b1) to be greater in high-\u03c3\nclusters than in low-\u03c3 clusters. This means the high-\u03c3 clus-\nterW0(H\u03b1) distribution should exceed that of low-\u03c3 groups\nat a fixed \u03a35; this is opposite to what we find, and cannot\ntherefore be the explanation for the small observed differ-\nence. Finally we note the remarkable similarity between the\nresults for \u03c3 < 400 km s\u22121 groups in both samples. Since the\n2dFGRS catalogue is highly complete, and the SDSS cata-\nlogue is highly pure, the persistence of a strong W0(H\u03b1)\u2013\u03a35\nrelation in groups from both catalogues is not likely due to\na selection effect.\nWe now consider the three dimensional Gaussian ker-\nnel density estimator with a 1.1 Mpc standard deviation,\n\u03c11.1 (the motivation for the choice of filtering size is given\nin Appendix C). The \u03c11.1 density measure allows us to find\ngalaxies in the very lowest density environments, which are\nnot easily measured from \u03a35 since that quantity projects\nthe galaxy distribution over a 2000 kms\u22121 cylinder3. In our\nanalysis, we exclude galaxies that are within 2.2 Mpc of a\nsurvey boundary, for which \u03c11.1 cannot be reliably deter-\nmined; we also note that \u03c11.1 becomes noisy when there are\n3 This projection corresponds to \u223c 25 Mpc, much larger than the\nlinear size of typical void regions (Benson et al. 2003).\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nGalaxy ecology in SDSS and 2dFGRS 9\n0.01 0.1 0.01 0.1\nFigure 7.

To approximately compare this with the\ncorresponding \u03a35 value, we compute the projected density\nwithin a cylinder of length 2\u00d71000 kms\u22121 along the line of\nsight, to obtain an equivalent surface density, shown along\nthe top axis. The emission-line fraction shows a strong de-\npendence on \u03c11.1, and gets significantly steeper at \u03c11.1 >\u223c 0.05\nMpc\u22123. However, the correlation is still present at the low-\nest densities observed. It is not clear whether the change in\nslope at \u03c11.1 >\u223c 0.05 Mpc\n\u22123 highlights an interesting physi-\ncal scale, or if \u03c11.1 simply loses sensitivity to the underlying\ndensity distribution at low densities, an effect that would\nbe exaggerated by the logarithmic scale. Furthermore, the\nhighest densities (which tend to correspond to clusters with\nhigh velocity dispersions) will generally be underestimated\nas a result of large peculiar velocities, and this may be partly\nresponsible for the change in slope.\n3.2 Local or Global Density?\nWe have shown that the fraction of star-forming galaxies\ndepends strongly on the local density, measured on scales\n<\u223c 1 Mpc, and that this correlation is approximately inde-\npendent of the velocity dispersion of the embedding cluster\nor group. However, velocity dispersion may not be the best\nmeasurement of large-scale structure; in this subsection, we\nwill compare densities measured on 1.1 Mpc and 5.5 Mpc\nscales, to determine whether W0(H\u03b1) shows any indepen-\ndent sensitivity to structure on large-scales.\nIn Fig. 7 we compare the Gaussian-filtered densities \u03c11.1\nand \u03c15.5 for galaxies in the SDSS and 2dFGRS samples.\nGalaxies are only considered if they are at least 11 Mpc from\na survey boundary. In Appendix C2 we show that these den-\nsity estimators are good tracers of intuitively dense and low-\ndensity regions, despite the complications of peculiar veloci-\nties in clusters (Fig. C4). Note that the 2dFGRS data extend\nto larger values of \u03c15.5 than the SDSS; these data arise from\na large supercluster region at z \u223c 0.0839 and \u03b1 \u223c 195.5,\n\u03b4 \u223c \u22122.9 (J2000 degrees). Fig. 7 shows a clear separation be-\ntween galaxies in groups (200 kms\u22121 < \u03c3 < 400 km s\u22121) and\nclusters (\u03c3 > 600 kms\u22121). Galaxies in both environments\nspan a similar range in local environment, characterised by\n\u03c11.1. However, galaxies in the high-velocity dispersion clus-\nters lie at higher densities on 5.5 Mpc scales, as expected\nsince they are physically larger systems. This is particularly\ntrue for the SDSS sample, where the groups are selected to\nhave approximately Gaussian distributed velocities, so that\nthere is likely to be less scatter in the relation between \u03c3\nand virial mass. Note that the higher velocity dispersions of\nclusters means that this pseudo-three-dimensional measure-\nment will underestimate the density, more so than in groups.\nThus the real difference between the clusters and groups is\neven larger than shown here.\nIn Fig. 8, we illustrate how the fraction of emission-\nline galaxies (measured from the nearest 500 galaxies in this\nplane) depends on these two very different density scales.\nInterestingly, the contours are not parallel with either axis,\nwhich indicates that the population composition shows a\ndependance on large (> 5 Mpc) scales, in addition to the\nmore local density measured at 1.1 Mpc. That is, the frac-\ntion of emission line galaxies is lower in regions that are\noverdense on 5.5 Mpc scales, even when the local (1.1 Mpc)\noverdensity is the same. We have checked that this is not\nan artifact of the smoothing or the correlation between \u03c11.1\nand \u03c15.5, in the following way. For each galaxy we assign a\nvalue of \u03c15.5, chosen at random from among galaxies that\nhave similar (within 10%) values of \u03c11.1. This preserves the\ncorrelations between \u03c11.1 and \u03c15.5, as well as between \u03c11.1\nand W0(H\u03b1), but removes any residual correlation between\n\u03c15.5 andW0(H\u03b1). In this case, the contours lie nearly paral-\nlel to the \u03c15.5 axis, confirming that the correlation we see in\nFig. 8 is real. There is some evidence that, at high densities,\nthe fraction of H\u03b1\u2013emitting galaxies is mostly dependent\non \u03c11.1, and the dependence on larger scales becomes more\nimportant at lower densities. The dependence on large-scale\ndensities is evidently stronger than the dependence on veloc-\nity dispersion (Fig. 5), despite the correlation between them\n(Fig. 7).\nA cautionary note needs to be added, however. Since\n\u03c11.1 and \u03c15.5 are intrinsically correlated, errors on these mea-\nsurements can give rise to the trends shown in Fig. 8, even if\nthe galaxy population only depends on one parameter. How-\never, a comparison with mock catalogues strongly suggests\nthat the observed dependence on both density scales is real\n(Balogh et al., in prep.).\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n10 Balogh et al.\nFigure 8.

Only galaxies that are at least 11 Mpc from a survey boundary are considered. The\ncontours trace the fraction of galaxies withW0(H\u03b1)> 4A\u02da, computed for the nearest 500 galaxies at each point in this plane.

For the SDSS sample the contours span fractions 0.25\u20130.45, while for\nthe 2dFGRS they span 0.35\u20130.65.\n4 DISCUSSION\n4.1 Overview\nThanks to the unique size and homogeneity of the 2dFGRS\nand SDSS datasets, we have been able to trace the H\u03b1 distri-\nbution of galaxies over the full range of environments at the\npresent day. This analysis has revealed three new, important\nclues about the process of galaxy formation:\n1. The change in W0(H\u03b1) distribution as a function of\nenvironment is predominantly due to a change in the rela-\ntive number of star\u2013forming and non-star-forming galaxies;\nthe W0(H\u03b1) distribution of actively star-forming galaxies\nthemselves do not appear to depend strongly on environ-\nment. This is a surprising result which challenges theories in\nwhich the environment at the present day induces a trans-\nformation in galaxy properties, as we discuss in detail in\nSection 4.2.\n2. The fraction of star\u2013forming galaxies increases con-\ntinuously with decreasing density. However, even at the\nlowest densities there is a substantial fraction of galax-\nies with negligible H\u03b1 emission; we will discuss the con-\nsequences of this in Section 4.3. There is evidence that the\ncorrelation with environment becomes steeper at \u03a35 >\u223c 1\nMpc\u22122, an effect that is also seen in the morphology\u2013\ndensity relation (Postman & Geller 1984; Treu et al. 2003).\nThis may represent an interesting scale at which differ-\nent physics becomes important; for example, as noted by\nPostman & Geller (1984), at this density the typical dy-\nnamical time of the group is longer than a Hubble time,\nso galaxy-galaxy interactions may start to play a role (see\nalso Zabludoff & Mulchaey 1998, 2000).\n3. The fraction of galaxies with H\u03b1 emission may depend\nnot only on the local density, but also on the density on\nmuch larger scales, \u223c 5.5 Mpc. If this trend is real, it means\nthe galaxy population must be only indirectly related to its\npresent-day environment. We discuss the implications of this\nin Section 4.4.\nThese three clues allow us to make advances in our un-\nderstanding of the evolution of star formation in the Uni-\nverse (Section 4.5), and of any additional physics that may\ntake place in dense environments (Section 4.6).\n4.2 Star-forming galaxies in dense environments\nIf galaxies at the present day are evolving as they move\nfrom low-density regions to high-density regions, we should\nsee a signature of this transformation which depends on the\nrelevant timescale. In particular, if all galaxies experience\na gradual (>\u223c 2 Gyr) decline in star formation when they\nbecome bound to groups or clusters (Balogh et al. 2000;\nBekki et al. 2002), we expect star-forming galaxies in dense\nregions to show systematically lower W0(H\u03b1). Fig. 4 shows\nthat this is not the case, implying that such a gradual decline\nis not a common phenomenon at the present time.\nOn the other hand, if the SFR declines rapidly to zero,\nthis might not be reflected in Fig. 4, since galaxies will\nquickly move from the star-forming distribution to the qui-\nescent one with W0(H\u03b1)< 4A\u02da. Instead, we need to look at a\nlonger-lived tracer of star formation (i.e. one which changes\nslowly after star formation ceases) to observe this effect. For\nexample, the H\u03b4 absorption line, which remains strong for\n\u223c 1 Gyr after star formation ceases, is a common diagnostic\nof recent activity. The extreme rarity (< 0.1 per cent) of\nbright galaxies with strong H\u03b4 but negligible star formation\nat low redshift provides evidence against the possibility that\nSFR has recently declined on a short timescale for a signif-\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nGalaxy ecology in SDSS and 2dFGRS 11\nicant number of galaxies (Zabludoff et al. 1996; Goto et al.\n2003); however, this depends on an accurate quantification\nof the duration of the enhanced H\u03b4 phase, which is systemat-\nically uncertain to within at least a factor of two. In particu-\nlar, if star formation is truncated in normal spirals, without\na preceding burst, the H\u03b4 line never gets very strong, and is\nonly enhanced for a short time (e.g. Balogh et al. 1999).\nIn a similar way, we can use the accurate colours of the\nSDSS, which do not suffer from aperture bias, to trace the\nlonger lived stellar population. In particular, we will consider\nthe rest frame Petrosian (g\u2212r) colour, denoted (g\u2212r)0, and\nuse the k-corrections of Blanton et al. (2003a). To isolate the\npopulation of galaxies with recent star formation, we select\nblue galaxies as those with (g\u2212r)0 < 0.7, which will include\nany galaxy that has formed stars within the last \u223c 300 Myr,\nusing the latest Bruzual & Charlot (2003) stellar popula-\ntion models4. Fig. 9 shows the W0(H\u03b1) distribution for all\nsuch blue galaxies, compared with that of blue galaxies in\ngroups (\u03c3 = 200\u2013400 kms\u22121) and clusters (\u03c3 > 600 kms\u22121).\nAll three distributions are consistent with being drawn from\nthe same parent population. If cluster galaxies had slowly\ndeclining SFRs they would remain blue, but with reduced\nW0(H\u03b1) (e.g Shioya et al. 2002), contrary to our observa-\ntions. This reinforces our conclusions drawn from Fig. 4,\nthat star-forming galaxies in dense environments have nor-\nmal SFRs, and are not being inhibited by their environment\nat the present day.\nHowever, we are still not able to rule out the possi-\nbility that the environment has caused the SFR to decline\nrapidly in a substantial number of cluster galaxies, as we\nnow demonstrate. There are 617 galaxies withW0(H\u03b1)< 4A\u02da\nin the \u03c3 > 600 km s\u22121 clusters. If the clusters have been\nconstantly, and uniformly, truncating star formation in ac-\ntive galaxies over the last \u223c 10 Gyr, we would only need\nto find \u223c 20 blue galaxies with W0(H\u03b1)< 4A\u02da in clusters\nwith \u03c3 > 600 km s\u22121 at the present day to account for\nthese currently inactive galaxies. This number is not incon-\nsistent with Fig. 9; in fact there is perhaps evidence for such\na population, though this may equally well be contamina-\ntion from the tail of the distinct, red galaxy population at\n(g \u2212 r)0 > 0.7. By the same argument, our results are con-\nsistent with a model in which 20 per cent of the cluster\nmembers not presently forming stars had their star forma-\ntion truncated sometime within the last 2 Gyr.\nThus, the (g \u2212 r)0 colour is too sensitive to recent star\nformation for us to put strong constraints on the number of\ncluster galaxies which have had their star formation trun-\ncated in the last few Gigayears. Galaxy morphology may\nprovide a better indicator, since an observable disk struc-\nture should persist for >\u223c 1 Gyr after star formation ceases\n(e.g. Bekki et al. 2002). Past analysis (Balogh et al. 1998;\nHashimoto et al. 1998; Paper II; Paper I; Girardi et al.\n2003) has indeed suggested that morphology and SFR are\npartly independent. Furthermore, the existence in clusters\nof HI-deficient spirals (e.g Solanes et al. 2001), red, spi-\nral galaxies with little star-formation (e.g. Poggianti et al.\n1999; Balogh et al. 2002a) and spiral galaxies with unusu-\nally smooth structure (McIntosh et al. 2003) all argue for\n4 Based on a model with a Salpeter initial mass function, and a\nSFR which declines exponentially (\u03c4 = 4 Gyr) for 10 Gyr.\nFigure 9.

However, many of these results are based on\na fairly coarse morphological binning; therefore, we reserve\ndrawing firm conclusions until reliable, automated morpho-\nlogical measurements are available for the present samples\n(e.g. Liske et al. 2003; Kelly & McKay 2003; Blanton et al.\n2003b).\n4.3 Isolated galaxies\nAlthough the fraction of emission-line galaxies continually\nincreases with decreasing density, it never gets much larger\nthan \u223c 70 per cent, even in the lowest density environments\nstudied here. In these empty regions of the Universe, envi-\nronment is not likely to have played a large role in galaxy\nevolution; therefore many galaxies must have ceased their\nstar-formation activity for reasons independent of their sur-\nroundings (but see below). In Fig. 10 we show the W0(H\u03b1)\ndistribution for galaxies in the lowest-density environments,\nwith \u03c11.1 < 0.01 Mpc\n\u22123 and \u03c15.5 < 0.005 Mpc\n\u22123, and unas-\nsociated with any catalogued group or cluster. We combine\nall galaxies from both the 2dFGRS and SDSS samples, and\nconsider only those galaxies which lie at least 11 Mpc from\na survey boundary. Even in these extremely sparse regions\nof space, only \u223c 70 per cent of galaxies are forming a sig-\nnificant number of stars, with W0(H\u03b1)> 4A\u02da, and this frac-\ntion is similar for both faint and bright galaxies5 (shown\nseparately in Fig. 10). A possible interpretation is that the\n\u223c 30 per cent of bright, isolated galaxies with no sign of\n5 Note that only the brightest isolated galaxies are sure to have\nno companions of comparable brightness, since fainter galaxies\ncould have neighbours that are just below our luminosity limit.\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n12 Balogh et al.\nFigure 10.

The\nshaded histogram shows the distribution for bright (> L\u2217) galax-\nies, and the solid line represents the fainter population.\nstar formation are fossil groups (Ponman & Bertram 1993;\nMulchaey & Zabludoff 1999; Smith et al. 2003; Jones et al.\n2003). Although we await morphological confirmation, we\nnote that these galaxies do have the colours typical of ellipti-\ncal galaxies, (g\u2212r)0 \u223c 0.75\u00b10.05. In this case, their isolation\nmay be a misleading representation of environment; in fact,\nthey may represent the most dense environments, where all\nbright, surrounding galaxies have merged into one.\n4.4 Dependence on large-scale structure\nWe showed in \u00a7 3.2 that, although the galaxy population\ndepends strongly on its local environment, it may also be\nsensitive to the density on >\u223c 5 Mpc scales, especially at low\ndensities. That is, fewer galaxies in supercluster-like envi-\nronments have significant H\u03b1 emission, relative to galaxies\nin environments with similar local densities. We currently\ntreat this conclusion as tentative, because a similar trend\ncould be caused by uncertainties in the correlated densities\n\u03c11.1 and \u03c15.5; however, comparison with mock catalogues\nstrongly suggest this is not the case (Balogh et al., in prep).\nA similar dependence on large-scale structure has previously\nbeen observed in the morphologies of galaxies in clusters at\nz \u223c 0.2 (Balogh et al. 2002c). Using high resolution Hubble\nSpace Telescope imaging to decompose the disk and bulge\ncomponents of cluster members, Balogh et al. (2002c) found\nevidence that the bulges of galaxies at a fixed local density\nare systematically brighter in massive clusters (as traced\nby their X-ray emission) than in low mass clusters. On the\nother hand, the disk luminosity function does not show this\ndependence. It was suggested that bulge components grow\npreferentially within large-scale overdensities, perhaps due\nto richer merger histories, but that the disk properties are\nnot sensitive to this structure.\nHowever, our results show that the galaxy popula-\ntion depends more strongly on the large-scale density than\non the mass of the embedding halo, as evidenced by the\nlack of correlation with cluster velocity dispersion, at a\nfixed \u03a35 (Fig. 5). This, together with the results of Sec-\ntion 4.2, suggests that galaxy properties are only indirectly\nrelated to their environment at the present day. For exam-\nple, the early-type population that dominates clusters to-\nday likely arises from the fact that galaxies in dense regions\nform earlier, and experience more galaxy-galaxy interactions\nthroughout their longer lifetime, than galaxies in underdense\nregions (Zabludoff & Mulchaey 1998; Blanton et al. 1999;\nBalland et al. 2003). Another possibility is that galaxy evo-\nlution is strongly affected by tidal forces, which which arise\nfrom structure on all scales (Gnedin 2003a; Moss & Whittle\n2000, e.g.).\n4.5 Implications for the global SFR evolution\nIt has been proposed that changes in the typical en-\nvironment, due to the hierarchical growth of structure,\ndrive the evolution in global SFR (Balogh & Bower 2002;\nBower & Balogh 2003). This hypothesis maintains that the\ncorrelation between SFR and local density remains un-\nchanged, but galaxies at higher redshift typically lie in lower\ndensity environments. However, this interpretation is incon-\nsistent with the present data, as we demonstrate here. The\nfraction of star\u2013forming galaxies (W0(H\u03b1)> 4A\u02da) is \u223c 0.4 in\nthe SDSS and \u223c 0.57 in the 2dFGRS. This is close to the\nmaximum fraction achieved in any environment at z = 0\n(e.g. Figs. 5 and 6; also Section 4.3). On the other hand,\nthe average SFR at z \u223c 0.4 is expected to be about 75%\nhigher than at the present day. This can be inferred from\nthe increase in the ultraviolet luminosity density of the Uni-\nverse (e.g., Wilson et al. 2002); a similar result is obtained\nby comparing the average [Oii] equivalent width at z \u223c 0.3\nfrom the CNOC surveys with that at z = 0 (Paper II). To\nachieve such a dramatic increase in the mean SFR, either\nthe fraction of star-forming galaxies at \u223c 0.4 is much higher\nthan anywhere at the present day, or the typical star-forming\ngalaxy has a higher SFR. It is interesting that Treu et al.\n(2003) find the fraction of morphologically\u2013classified early-\ntype galaxies in low-density regions has not evolved substan-\ntially between z = 0.4 and z = 0, suggesting that evolution\nis of the latter type. Either way, the galaxy population at\nz = 0.4 must be different from that in any environment at\nz = 0.\nA direct test of evolution in the SFR\u2013density correlation\nis not yet possible, as intermediate- and high-redshift clus-\nter data do not generally extend far enough from the cluster\ncentre (Balogh et al. 1997; Couch et al. 2001; Balogh et al.\n2002a,b). Kodama et al. (2001), however, have analysed\nmulticolour Subaru data which shows that the red sequence\nin the z \u223c 0.4 cluster Cl0939 first becomes apparent in re-\ngions where the local projected density exceeds 30 Mpc\u22122\n(see the Erratum of Kodama et al. 2003). Their photometric\nobservations are much deeper than ours, and are complete\nto \u223c 0.02L\u2217V . Correcting for this difference, their measure-\nment of the critical density corresponds to \u03a35 \u223c 4\u00b12 Mpc\n\u22122\nin our units. This is similar to the result found in Paper I\nand Paper II, and seen in Fig. 3, which suggests that any\nevolution in the SFR\u2013density relation has been small. How-\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nGalaxy ecology in SDSS and 2dFGRS 13\never, any serious interpretation of this comparison should\nwait until comparable, spectroscopic measurements can be\nmade of the galaxy population composition as a continuous\nfunction of density.\n4.6 The physics of galaxy evolution\nBased on the results presented here, it seems unlikely that\na substantial fraction of the star-forming galaxy population\nis today undergoing a physical transformation induced by\nits environment. Instead, the observed trends with density\nat z \u223c 0 are probably only related indirectly to their envi-\nronment, and the physics which determines the final com-\nposition of galaxy groups and clusters probably took place\nat a much earlier time. Similar conclusions were reached\nby Zabludoff & Mulchaey (1998), based on the high frac-\ntions of early-type galaxies in nearby, X-ray groups. Ob-\nservations of the local Universe alone can only put weak\nconstraints on what the relevant physics might be, except\nto say that it is unlikely to be dominated by ram-pressure\nstripping (e.g. Gunn & Gott 1972; Quilis et al. 2000). This\nmechanism has the distinct advantage that there is good\nobservational evidence for such activity (e.g. Veilleux et al.\n1999; Vollmer et al. 2000; Gavazzi et al. 2002; van Gorkom\n2003); however, it seems unlikely that it could play any role\nin the lowest-density environments.\nSimilarly, it may be difficult to interpret our results in\nthe context of models in which SFR declines slowly in galax-\nies that are accreted into groups and clusters (Balogh et al.\n2000; Diaferio et al. 2001; Bekki et al. 2002), for reasons dis-\ncussed in Section 4.2. In particular, galaxy groups are ex-\npected to represent the first level of the hierarchy in which\nheating and stripping of the hot halo gas is likely to in-\nfluence star formation (e.g. Diaferio et al. 2001; Cole et al.\n2000; Blanton et al. 1999; Hernquist & Springel 2003), yet\nblue galaxies within such groups appear to have a normal\nW0(H\u03b1) distribution, suggesting normal, recent star forma-\ntion histories. However, the predictions of hierarchical mod-\nels are not straightforward, because local density, halo mass,\nand formation time are all correlated in a non-trivial way. It\nis possible that including the effects of infall (Ellingson et al.\n2001) and projection effects (Diaferio et al. 2001), in addi-\ntion to a slow-decay model (Balogh et al. 2000) conspire to\nkeep the shape of the W0(H\u03b1) distribution constant. We\nwill therefore leave a detailed comparison with theory for a\nsubsequent paper (Balogh et al., in prep).\nA more viable explanation is perhaps suggested by\nobservations of close galaxy pairs, which are the only\nenvironmentally\u2013selected population to show enhance-\nments of star formation (Barton et al. 2000; Lambas et al.\n2002). These bursts likely lead to the rapid consump-\ntion of cold gas, and the eventual formation of gas-\npoor elliptical galaxies with little star formation (e.g.\nPonman & Bertram 1993; Mulchaey & Zabludoff 1999;\nSmith et al. 2003). Such galaxy-galaxy interactions must\ntypically occur long before a galaxy is bound to a viri-\nalised group or cluster, since the SFRs in those envi-\nronments are so low (e.g. Zabludoff & Mulchaey 1998).\nIn fact, there is evidence for interaction\u2013induced star\nformation in the unvirialised regions of clusters (e.g.\nCaldwell & Rose 1997; Moss & Whittle 2000), and for a\ncorrelation between morphological distortions and environ-\nment (Hashimoto & Oemler 2000). The observed correla-\ntion with local density then arises because galaxies in\ndense regions have typically had more interactions, over\na longer period of time, than those in low-density re-\ngions (e.g. Balland et al. 2003; Gnedin 2003a,b). Since the\ninteraction rate may increase substantially with redshift\n(Patton et al. 2002; Conselice et al. 2003), we would expect\nmost of the environmentally-induced galaxy transformation\nto have taken place at higher redshift; this would be con-\nsistent with the strong evolution observed in the fraction of\npost-starburst galaxies (Poggianti et al. 2003).\nWe might therefore be surprised that the correlation be-\ntween emission\u2013line fraction and local density is so similar\nin the groups in the present study, relative to other environ-\nments, since the low velocity dispersions and high densities\nin groups should encourage interactions (e.g. Aarseth & Fall\n1980; Barnes 1985; Merritt 1985). Our groups are very het-\nerogeneous, and not all are necessarily bound systems. It is\npossible that interactions are important in specific types of\ngroup, such as compact groups. We will leave such investi-\ngations for future work.\nFinally, we note that there is no observed correla-\ntion between the fraction of AGN and environment at\nthe present day (Miller et al. 2003). This is puzzling, es-\npecially in the context of models where star formation\nand AGN activity are both linked to the availability of\ncold gas (Kauffmann & Haehnelt 2000; Granato et al. 2003;\nDi Matteo et al. 2003). It appears that star formation ac-\ntivity must stop (or become undetectable) when there is\nstill some cold gas left. One possibility is that the gas\ndensity drops below a certain threshold necessary for star\nformation (e.g. Kennicutt 1989; Martin & Kennicutt 2001;\nWong & Blitz 2002; Boissier et al. 2003; Gnedin 2003a), but\ncan still flow to the centre and fuel an AGN.\n5 CONCLUSIONS\nWe have made a joint analysis of 24968 galaxies selected\nfrom the SDSS and 2dFGRS. The distribution of W0(H\u03b1)\namong these galaxies is bimodal, consisting of an active pop-\nulation of galaxies withW0(H\u03b1)> 4 A\u02da, and a quiescent pop-\nulation with no significant star formation at the present day.\nWe have investigated how this distribution depends on en-\nvironment, as characterised by:\n\u2022 The projected surface number density of galaxies \u03a35,\ndetermined from the distance to the fifth-nearest neighbour.\n\u2022 The three-dimensional number density of galaxies mea-\nsured on 1.1 Mpc and 5.5 Mpc scales, \u03c11.1 and \u03c15.5.\n\u2022 The velocity dispersion of the embedding structure, as\ndetermined from the group catalogues of Eke et al. (2003)\nand Nichol, Miller et al. (in preparation).\nWe use these different measures of environment to establish\nthe scales and structures on which the present-day galaxy\npopulation depends. Our findings are summarised as follows:\n1. The distribution of H\u03b1 line strength for the star-\nforming population, selected on W0(H\u03b1) or (g \u2212 r) colour,\ndoes not itself depend strongly on environment. Thus, it is\nunlikely that SFRs are gradually decreasing in a substantial\nnumber of star-forming galaxies in or near dense environ-\nments today.\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n14 Balogh et al.\n2. The fraction of galaxies with W0(H\u03b1)> 4A\u02da decreases\nsteadily with increasing local density. There is evidence that\nit decreases more strongly at densities exceeding \u03a35 \u223c 1\nMpc\u22122, or \u03c11.1 >\u223c 0.05 Mpc\n\u22123. The persistence of this corre-\nlation at low densities means that ram\u2013pressure stripping,\nat any redshift, cannot be the only physical mechanism at\nwork.\n3. The fraction of galaxies brighter than M\u2217 + 1 with\nW0(H\u03b1)> 4A\u02da is never more than \u223c 70 per cent, even in\nthe least dense environments explored here. We have shown\nthat this means the recent decline in globally-averaged star\nformation rate cannot be wholly due to the growth of large\nscale structure.\n4. The emission-line fraction of a galaxy population ap-\npears to depend both on the local environment (on \u223c 1\nMpc scales) and on the large-scale structure as parame-\nterised by the density \u223c 5.5 Mpc scales. There is little fur-\nther dependence on the velocity dispersion of the group or\ncluster in which the galaxy is embedded. This result sug-\ngests that the composition of the galaxy population today\nis likely related indirectly to its present environment (see\nalso Zabludoff & Mulchaey 1998, 2000).\nThe most likely physical explanations for the correlation\nbetween W0(H\u03b1) distribution and environment at z = 0 are\nthose which are effective over a large range of environment,\naffect the SFR on short (< 1 Gyr) timescales, and were\nmuch more effective in the past. As suggested by previous\nauthors (e.g. Zabludoff et al. 1996; Mulchaey & Zabludoff\n1998; Hashimoto et al. 1998; Hashimoto & Oemler 2000),\none good candidate is starbursts induced by galaxy interac-\ntions, since close pairs of galaxies are the only environment\nknown to directly provoke a physical transformation. Such\ninteractions will likely be more common at high redshift,\nand will have had more time to influence galaxies that end\nup in high density environments.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe gratefully acknowledge the efforts of all persons whose\ncontributions led to the success of the 2dFGRS and SDSS,\nwhich in turn have made this work possible.

In particular, our measurements of H\u03b1 flux will un-\nderestimate the flux from the galaxy as a whole; we refer\nto this as the aperture bias. Aperture bias will not impact\non our results if the average galaxy size does not correlate\nstrongly with environment. We test this in Fig. A1, where\nwe plot the SDSS galaxy Petrosian radius as a function of\n\u03a35 and of group velocity dispersion. Note that Hopkins et al.\n(2003) find the amount of emission line flux lost due to aper-\nture bias in the SDSS is a factor \u223c 2 for galaxies with radius\n\u223c 3\u2032\u2032, increasing to a factor \u223c 10 for galaxies with radius\n> 12\u2032\u2032. However, there is no significant trend of galaxy size\nwith environment. Therefore, although the absolute values\nof the W0(H\u03b1) may be affected\n6 by aperture bias, the rel-\native trends as a function of environment are secure. This\nconclusion requires the further assumption that the spatial\n6 Note that W0(H\u03b1) is not necessarily underestimated, as it is\na relative quantity. The effect of aperture bias depends on the\nspatial distribution of star formation; if it is uniform, W0(H\u03b1) is\nnot affected by this bias.\nFigure A1. The Petrosian radius is shown as a function of local,\nprojected density \u03a35 (left panel) and of group velocity dispersion\n(right panel), for galaxies in the SDSS sample. The dashed lines\nshow the median and 75th percentile of the distribution, in run-\nning bins each containing 500 galaxies; the solid line represents\nthe mean.\ndistribution of star formation in a galaxy depends only on its\nSFR, and not its environment. For example, if star forma-\ntion in cluster galaxies is more concentrated than for galax-\nies in the field with similar SFRs (e.g. Moss & Whittle 1993,\n2000), the aperture corrections for cluster galaxies should be\nsmaller.\nAPPENDIX B: DETAILED COMPARISON OF\nTHE CATALOGUES\nHere we compare the 2dFGRS and SDSS samples in detail.\nThe most important difference between them for our pur-\nposes is that the 2dFGRS is selected from bJ photometric\nmagnitudes, while the SDSS is selected from digital r pho-\ntometry. The SDSS survey is somewhat shallower, and our\nvolume-limited sample is complete toMr = \u221220.6. From the\ntables of Fukugita et al. (1995), an Sab galaxy at z = 0.06\nhas a colour (bJ\u2212r)=1.13, so we adopt a magnitude limit of\nMb = \u221219.5 for the 2dFGRS sample; the survey is actually\ncomplete to 0.5 magnitudes fainter than this.\nIn the area of sky covering approximately 155< \u03b1 <220\nand \u22123 < \u03b4 < 1.5 degrees, the 2dFGRS and SDSS surveys\noverlap. We can use this overlap region to directly compare\nthe galaxy and group catalogues. In our volume-limited sub-\nsample, we find 1029 galaxies in common between the two\nsurveys (within 2\u2032\u2032 and 100 km s\u22121 of one another). The dis-\ntribution of the difference between the absolute 2dFGRS bJ\nmagnitude and the absolute SDSS r magnitude are shown\nin Fig. B1. The average colour is MbJ \u2212Mr \u223c 0.95, simi-\nlar to the colour we expected (see above). Thus we can be\nconfident that our magnitude limits are matched as closely\nas possible. However, the 1\u03c3 standard deviation in colour is\n\u223c 0.35; thus there will be large numbers of galaxies at the\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nGalaxy ecology in SDSS and 2dFGRS 17\n0 0.5 1 1.5\n0\n20\n40\n60\nFigure B1. The distribution of the differences between the abso-\nlute magnitudes of 1460 galaxies in our sample that are identified\nin both SDSS and 2dFGRS catalogues.\nfaint limit of one catalogue that will not be included in the\nother.\nThe consequences of this are shown in Fig. B2, where\nwe compare the distributions ofW0(H\u03b1) in the two samples.\nRecall that an absorption correction of 1A\u02da has been applied\nto all measurements (see Section 2). The two distributions\nare very similar; however, there are relatively more galaxies\nwith substantial H\u03b1 emission in the 2dFGRS sample. The\nmean equivalent width is 8.1A\u02da in the SDSS, and 11.9A\u02da in the\n2dFGRS; a similar difference is seen in the 75th percentiles,\nwhich are also \u223c 30% larger in the 2dFGRS sample. The\nlarger errors on the 2dFGRS spectra also result in a larger\npopulation of galaxies with W0(H\u03b1)<0 A\u02da, at the expense of\ngalaxies in the peak (with W0(H\u03b1)=0 A\u02da).\nThe difference in Fig. B2 is due entirely to the blue se-\nlection of the 2dFGRS. In Fig. B3 we directly compare the\nW0(H\u03b1) for galaxies in common between the two surveys.\nMost (67%) of the measurements are within 2A\u02da of one an-\nother. In the mean, the SDSS measurement of W0(H\u03b1) is\n0.6A\u02da larger than that of the 2dFGRS. This difference is too\nsmall (and in the wrong sense) to account for the difference\nin Fig. B2. We also show the comparison for galaxies at\nz < 0.075 and z > 0.085; there is no discernible difference\nbetween them. Since the 2dFGRS and SDSS use different\nsize fibres, this gives added confidence that aperture effects\ndo not have a large influence on our results.\nWe can also make a direct comparison between the\ngroup catalogues. In Fig. B4 we show the positions of groups\nin both surveys, within a 10\u25e6 \u00d7 7\u25e6 region. In both cases\nwe show all groups within 0.05 < z < 0.095 and with\n\u03c3 > 200 kms\u22121 and at least ten members above our lu-\nminosity limit. For the SDSS we show all the groups sat-\nisfying these criteria; however, in this paper we have only\nused those with well-determined velocity dispersions, shown\nas the solid circles. Within the full overlap region there are\n29 such 2dFGRS groups, compared with 24 SDSS groups; 16\nFigure B2. The distribution of H\u03b1 equivalent width in the two\nsamples. A 1 A\u02da correction for underlying stellar absorption has\nbeen made in both cases. The 2dFGRS distribution has been\nrenormalised to match the number of galaxies in the SDSS, to\nfacilitate the comparison.\nFigure B3. The difference between W0(H\u03b1) measured in the\n2dFGRS and SDSS samples, for 1029 galaxies in common. Thirty-\nthree galaxies lie outside the bounds of this diagram. The dotted\nand dashed lines show the same distribution, but restricted to\ngalaxies at z < 0.075 and z > 0.085, respectively.\nof the latter have well-determined velocity dispersions. The\nradii of the circles represents the cluster virial radius, esti-\nmated from the velocity dispersion as Rvir = 3.5\u03c3(1+z)\n\u22121.5\n(Girardi et al. 1998). The correspondence between the two\ngroup catalogues is remarkably good.\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n18 Balogh et al.\nFigure B4. Galaxies are shown in a 25 square degree region of\nspace where the 2dFGRS and SDSS overlap. Galaxy groups in\nthe 2dFGRS sample, with \u03c3 > 200 km s\u22121 and at least ten bright\nmembers, are shown as thin circles, with a radius correspond-\ning to the virial radius (proportional to velocity dispersion). The\nthick circles are SDSS groups; dashed circles have significant sub-\nstructure and poorly-determined velocity dispersions.\nAPPENDIX C: DENSITY ESTIMATORS\nIn this Appendix, we consider two different density estima-\ntors in turn. The first is a projected surface density, based\non counting the number of nearest neighbours. The second is\na three-dimensional, fixed-scale estimator derived by kernel\ndensity estimation.\nC1 Nearest-neighbour approach\nThe most common method is to measure the distance to\nthe N th nearest neighbour, and measure the density within\nthat distance. Dressler\u2019s (1980) original prescription called\nfor taking the area to be a box enclosing the tenth nearest\nneighbour, before background subtraction. Others have em-\nployed similar methods, but by using a spherical area and\nfirst subtracting foreground and background galaxies (e.g.,\nPapers I and II). This latter difference means that densities\nare typically measured in a larger volume, since the tenth\nnearest neighbour is further away after background subtrac-\ntion. In general, we will define dN as the distance to the\nN th-nearest neighbour after background subtraction; then\nthe projected density is given by \u03a3N = N\/(\u03c0d\n2\nN).\nAlthough this is a two-dimensional estimate, we wish to\nuse the redshift information to remove the foreground and\nbackground. In some cases, this has been done by remov-\ning galaxies more than 3\u03c3 from the cluster (e.g. Paper I;\nBalogh et al. 2002a), where \u03c3 is the cluster velocity disper-\nsion. However, this is only reliable if \u03c3 is well known, and the\nvelocity distribution is Gaussian. We will therefore choose a\nfixed velocity interval of \u00b11000 km s\u22121 within which to com-\npute the local density. This allows us to include most of the\ngalaxies in systems with large velocity dispersions, while still\nkeeping contamination low. We choose N = 5 to be similar\nto that defined by Dressler (1980), who used N = 10 before\nbackground subtraction.\nC1.1 Projection effects\nOur density estimator \u03a35 is a projected quantity, includ-\ning all galaxies within \u00b11000 km s\u22121 of the target galaxy, or\n\u00b114 Mpc for H0 = 70 kms\n\u22121Mpc\u22121. We will use the 2dF-\nGRS as an example (an analogous calculation can be done\nfor the SDSS) and estimate the contamination at a given\nmeasured density \u03a35 by assuming background galaxies are\ndistributed at the mean galaxy density. From the galaxy lu-\nminosity function of Norberg et al. (2002), we calculate that\nthe number of galaxies within a projected cylinder of radius\nd is \u223c 0.17d2. If we take d5 to be the distance to the fifth-\nnearest neighbour, then the fraction of projected galaxies\nwithin d5 is given by fproj = 0.17\/(\u03c0\u03a35). This varies from\n100 per cent at \u03a35 = 0.054 Mpc\n\u22122 (which therefore repre-\nsents the field density) to 5 percent by \u03a35 = 1 Mpc\n\u22122. In en-\nvironments typical of the field, the fraction of emission-line\ngalaxies is \u223c 70 per cent (Fig. 5). Therefore, the true, unpro-\njected emission-line fraction, fem, is related to the observed\nfraction fobs, by fem = (fobs \u2212 0.7fproj)\/(1\u2212 fproj). In Fig-\nure C1 we show how the ratio fem\/fobs depends on \u03a35. The\ncorrection is small, <\u223c 5 per cent at all values of \u03a35. We also\nshow how this ratio changes if we assume the background\nis ten times more dense than the average, which might be\nthe case in the vicinity of clusters and groups. However, in\nthis case we should adopt a smaller intrinsic emission-line\nfraction, because the projected galaxies are themselves in a\nmore dense environment; based on Figure 5 we take this to\nbe 60 per cent. Even in this case, the correction required to\naccount for projection is < 25 per cent for \u03a35 > 1 Mpc\n\u22122. In\nreality, such a dense field projection is probably only reason-\nable at the highest \u03a35, where the correction is <\u223c 15 per cent.\nWe conclude that projection will only have a small effect on\nthe trends observed in Fig. 5 and similar figures.\nC2 Fixed scale estimates: kernel density\nestimation\nIn this section, we will consider density estimates within a\nfixed distance of a galaxy. We will use a Gaussian filtering\nkernel which has some weight in the wings, so that more\nweight is given to galaxies which are closer, while there is\nstill sensitivity to more distant structures. A rigorous statis-\ntical analysis shows that the density estimate, for any data\ndistribution, is sensitive mostly to the bandwidth \u03b8 of the\nsmoothing kernel, and much less sensitive to the shape of the\nkernel (Silverman 1986). The strong bandwidth dependence\nis shown explicitly in Fig. C2, where we plot the average den-\nsity as a function of \u03b8. Four curves are shown, corresponding\nto the four quartiles of the density distribution evaluated at\n\u03b8 = 2 Mpc. In general, smaller bandwidths result in greater\ndensities. Thus, what do we choose for the optimal band-\nwidth? In abstract terms, the problem is to find an estimate\nf\u02c6 of the underlying density distribution function f which\nminimises the average value of the mean squared error:\nMSE(f, f\u02c6) =\n\u2329\u222b [\nf(x)\u2212 f\u02c6(x)\n]2\ndx\n\u232a\n. (C1)\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nGalaxy ecology in SDSS and 2dFGRS 19\nFigure C1. The ratio between the true fraction of emission line\ngalaxies (W0(H\u03b1)> 4 A\u02da) and the observed fraction, which is con-\ntaminated by projection along the line of sight, for the 2dFGRS.\nThe solid line represents the case where the projected galaxies\nare at the average density of the Universe, while the dotted line\nis calculated assuming this density is ten times larger.\nFigure C2. The dependence of three-dimensional density esti-\nmate on bandwidth, for the combined sample. Here, the band-\nwidth is the standard deviation of the kernel. The sample is di-\nvided into four based on the quartiles of the density at \u03b8 = 2\nMpc. Thus, the top curve shows the average density of the 25%\nof galaxies which have the greatest density at \u03b8 = 2 Mpc, while\nthe bottom curve corresponds to the 25% with the lowest density\nat that point.\nFigure C3. The least-squares cross validation score (arbitrarily\nscaled), as a function of bandwidth, for the SDSS and 2dFGRS\nsamples (solid and dotted lines, respectively). Both curves show a\nclear minimum near \u223c 1.1 Mpc.\nWe want to use the data itself to find the optimal band-\nwidth, \u03b8, which minimises this error. Since\n\u222b\nf2(x)dx does\nnot depend on \u03b8, this corresponds to minimising the func-\ntion:\nJ(\u03b8) =\n\u222b\nf\u02c62(x)dz \u2212 2\n\u222b\nf\u02c6(x)f(x)dx. (C2)\nThe method of least-squares cross-validation uses the data\nXi to obtain an unbiased estimate of this function:\nJ\u02c6(\u03b8) \u2248\n1\n\u03b8n2\n\u2211\ni\n\u2211\nj\nK\u2217\n(\nXi \u2212Xj\n\u03b8\n)\n+\n2\nn\u03b8\nK(0), (C3)\nwhere K(x) is the kernel function, and K\u2217 = K(x)\u2217K(x)\u2212\n2K(x) (Wasserman et al. 2001). This function can be com-\nputed using the fast Fourier transform (Silverman 1986), but\nthis method is relatively slow, and can be inaccurate due to a\nnumber of necessary approximations. We have implemented\na new, substantially improved algorithm based on adaptive\ncomputational geometry and a hierarchical finite-difference\napproximation (Gray & Moore 2003a,b).\nWe performed a cross-validation analysis of our volume-\nlimited, combined sample. We use a Gaussian kernel for the\ncross-validation, but recall that the optimal value of \u03b8 is in-\nsensitive to the exact kernel choice. Here, we are computing\nthree-dimensional densities \u03c1\u03b8, assuming the redshifts indi-\ncate line-of-sight position in a \u039b CDM model, and ignoring\nthe effects of redshift distortions. Fig. C3 shows the least-\nsquares value as a function of bandwidth. We see that the\noptimal bandwidth is \u223c 1.1 Mpc, which we will therefore\nuse as our best estimate of the three-dimensional local den-\nsity. To measure the sensitivity of galaxy properties to larger\nscales, though, we will also consider densities measured on\n5.5 Mpc scales, \u03c15.5.\nNote that the density estimate at a given galaxy may\nbe arbitrarily low, since the density at that point is mea-\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n20 Balogh et al.\nsured from the surrounding data, not including the point\nitself. Densities become significantly underestimated if the\nwidth of the Gaussian, \u03b8, is comparable to the distance to\nthe nearest boundary. We therefore only consider galaxies\nfarther than 2\u03b8 from a survey boundary when using these\nestimators.\nTo see more directly what the density estimates on\ndifferent scales are measuring, we show, in Fig. C4, pie-\ndiagrams for a section of the 2dFGRS. In each diagram,\nwe show all galaxies that lie at least 11 Mpc from the sur-\nvey boundary7. Marked as thick, black circles are galaxies in\ndifferent density environments, as labelled. For each of the\nthree density estimators, we show galaxies in the highest\nand lowest \u223c 6 per cent density environments. High values\nof both \u03a35 and \u03c11.1 are good at finding relatively small, but\ndense clumps. At low densities, both estimators are good\nat finding isolated galaxies; however, \u03a35 is unable to dis-\ntinguish truly isolated galaxies from those in low-density\nfilaments in the plane of the sky, while \u03c11.1 measures as low-\ndensity some cluster galaxies that are elongated along the\nline of sight. In contrast with these, \u03c15.5 is sensitive to much\nlarger scales. The densest galaxies, as measured on this scale,\nare only those in the massive supercluster, while the lowest-\ndensity environments are true voids, far from filaments or\nclusters.\n7 This motivates our choice to show the 2dFGRS data rather than\nthe SDSS data. The SDSS DR1 catalogue is much more patchy,\nand there are few large, contiguous regions where all galaxies are\nat least 11 Mpc from a boundary.\nFigure C4.
