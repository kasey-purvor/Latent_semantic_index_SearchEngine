We emphasise the importance of understanding the conceptual differences between weak and strong sustainability. We then outline what we consider to be current best practice in measurement, all the time flagging the relationship between our discussion and that of the SEEA-2003. This is an important task in our view, because, despite covering a very wide range of relevant conceptual and empirical issues, the handbook is by design not meant to provide clear guidelines for the purpose of measuring sustainability in either its weak or strong version.<\/dc:description><dc:date>\n        2007-03-15<\/dc:date><dc:type>\n        Article<\/dc:type><dc:type>\n        PeerReviewed<\/dc:type><dc:format>\n        application\/pdf<\/dc:format><dc:language>\n        en<\/dc:language><dc:identifier>\n        http:\/\/eprints.lse.ac.uk\/3058\/1\/Weak_and_strong_sustainability_in_the_SEEA_%28LSERO%29.pdf<\/dc:identifier><dc:identifier>\n          Dietz, Simon and Neumayer, Eric  (2007) Weak and strong sustainability in the SEEA: concepts and measurement.
