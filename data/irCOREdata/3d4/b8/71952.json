This paper explores the compatibility of Luce Irigaray\u2019s recent insistence on the \nneed to revalue nature, and to recognise culture\u2019s natural roots, with her earlier advocacy of \nsocial transformation towards a culture of sexual difference. Prima facie, there is tension \nbetween Irigaray\u2019s political imperatives, for if culture really is continuous with nature, this \nimplies that our existing, non-sexuate, culture is naturally grounded and unchallengeable. To \ndissolve this tension, Irigaray must conceive culture as having self-transformative agency \nwithout positioning culture as active vis-\u00e0-vis an inert and passive nature. I argue that \nIrigaray achieves this by conceiving culture to arise from a division internal to nature. She \nderives this idea from H\u00f6lderlin, who claims that nature originally divides itself into subjects \nand objects, and from Heidegger, who maintains that nature inflicts an originary violence \nupon itself. Critically reworking H\u00f6lderlin and Heidegger, Irigaray argues that male nature \ntends to turn against itself to generate an anti-natural, ecologically destructive, culture. She \nargues, however, that this tendency can be redirected and alleviated by the very cultural \nresources which male nature generates in dividing itself. Irigaray thus develops a unique way \nto advocate social change while recognising nature\u2019s profound impact and influence upon \nculture.  \n \nThis paper offers an interpretation of Luce Irigaray\u2019s later philosophical reflections on the \nrelation between nature and culture.1 Irigaray is now widely recognised as a thinker of \nchange, who seeks social transformation towards a culture of sexual difference, within which \n 2 \nfemininity and masculinity would share equivalent value and symbolic and civil status.2 In \nher recent work, Irigaray also urges cultural change to recognise the value and fundamental \nimportance of nature, and to recognise how profoundly culture is invariably shaped by, and \ndependent upon, nature. She insists that \u2018it is from the natural that we should start over in \norder to refound reason\u2019 and that thinking must \u2018understand its natural roots and resources\u2019.3 \nYet there appears to be some tension between Irigaray\u2019s political imperatives, for if every \nculture has natural roots, then our current non-sexuate culture must be naturally grounded and \ntherefore, presumably, resistant to change. To understand Irigaray\u2019s later thought, and to \nappreciate the continuities within her political and philosophical thinking as a whole, it is \nimportant to explore how her recent attention to humanity\u2019s dependence upon nature builds \non, rather than compromises, her earlier insistence on the necessity and possibility of cultural \nchange.  \nThis question is not narrowly relevant to scholars of Irigaray\u2019s thought, but has \nimportance for broader debates in feminist philosophy. Contemporary feminist thinkers \ngenerally agree that western culture and society have a pervasive tendency to devalue and \ndenigrate nature relative to culture and to align nature symbolically with femininity, which \nbecomes equally devalued. Thus, most feminist thinkers concur that women\u2019s situation can \nbe improved only through symbolic and social change to recognise culture\u2019s dependence \nupon, and continuity with, nature. However, if culture truly is continuous with nature, this \nimplies that there must be some natural basis for current, patriarchal, culture, and hence that \nthis culture cannot readily be changed. This undesirable implication pushes feminists back to \naffirming culture\u2019s independence of, or underdetermination by, nature; yet that affirmation \nthreatens to perpetuate women\u2019s symbolic devaluation, insofar as women are aligned with \nnature. Seeking to escape this dilemma, many feminist theorists contest the culture\/nature \n 3 \nantithesis, suggesting that, although culture has a natural basis, nature is always already \ncultural too.  \nFor instance, Elizabeth Grosz argues that feminists should neither ignore nature nor \ntreat it as a blank slate for cultural inscriptions, but examine how culture and nature \nintertwine.4 She suggests that nature sets limits to cultural possibilities, and that nature \nconsists of multiple tendencies and potentialities, which cultures can develop in variable \nways (VB, 187, 191). Grosz takes etching as a model for this process of cultural \ndevelopment, since etching must \u2018take into account the specificities of the materials \u2026 being \ninscribed and their concrete effects in the kind of text produced\u2019 (VB, 191). Yet Grosz goes \non to deny that nature has any determinate character prior to cultural development. She \nclaims that the natural limits to culture are malleable, because nature\u2019s potentialities are not \ngiven prior to culture but produced through cultural processes (VB, 188, 227). Ultimately, \nthen, Grosz believes that culture interacts only with a nature that is already a cultural artefact. \nIn this way, she continues to privilege culture over nature, identifying culture as the \nontologically basic reality, from which nature derives.5 A more ambiguous assessment of \nnature\u2019s intertwining with culture is provided by Moira Gatens, who argues that there are \ndeterminate natural tendencies and forces upon which culture builds.6 Although, for Gatens, \nthese tendencies are culturally pliable, she suggests that the culture which modifies natural \ntendencies is always given determinate direction by natural forces in their initial form. \nGatens\u2019 approach promises to allow a more genuine interweaving of nature with culture, yet \nprompts several questions. How far must culture be independent of natural tendencies in \norder to modify them? If culture is independent of those tendencies, then how far do they \never really direct it? \nIrigaray\u2019s later philosophy provides answers to these questions, suggesting that \nculture has agency vis-\u00e0-vis nature only because culture arises from an internal division \n 4 \nwithin nature itself. She supports this suggestion with a unique and complex conception of \nthe nature\/culture relationship which arises from her engagement with Heidegger and, \nultimately, with the German Romantic poet Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin. In tracing how Irigaray \nelaborates this conception, I will begin by examining her critique of patriarchal culture\u2019s \nhostility to nature in Thinking the Difference (1989). Irigaray argues that this culture stems \nfrom men\u2019s naturally destructive tendencies, and, to explain how patriarchal culture can be \nboth anti-natural and rooted in nature, she suggests that this culture emerges in a movement \nwhereby nature turns against itself. As I hope to show, Irigaray derives this intriguing idea \nfrom H\u00f6lderlin\u2019s view that nature originally divides itself (which Heidegger rewrites as the \nview that nature inflicts violence upon itself, although here I shall focus principally on \nH\u00f6lderlin, as the originator of this entire line of thought concerning nature). Modifying \nH\u00f6lderlin, Irigaray argues that male nature tends to turn against itself, but that this tendency \ncan be overcome through the very cultural resources which (male) nature generates in its self-\ndivision.7 Thus, Irigaray advocates cultural change to transform nature\u2019s originally self-\ndestructive tendencies, but since she conceives culture as natural, she avoids reproducing the \nmasculinism of the traditional culture\/nature hierarchy. Her later thought can thus make a \nvaluable contribution to feminist reflection on nature and culture by understanding cultural \nchange as compatible with renewed recognition of, and esteem for, nature.   \n \n1. Nature and culture in Irigaray\u2019s Thinking the Difference \nIrigaray does not explicitly set out her novel conception of the nature\/culture relationship, but \nit is implicit in several of her later texts, most notably the essay \u2018A Chance to Live\u2019 in \nThinking the Difference and the chapter of To Be Two (1994) entitled \u2018Between Us, a \nFabricated World\u2019. Whereas her discussion of nature and culture in the latter text is mediated \nthrough readings of Heidegger, H\u00f6lderlin, and Sophocles, the earlier text is couched in a \n 5 \nmore popular style (originally presented as a talk to the Italian Communist Party). Yet, in \naddition to popularising Irigaray\u2019s earlier ideas, Thinking the Difference outlines a unique \napproach to the relation between nature and culture. Irigaray\u2019s burgeoning interest in this \ntheme stems from her concern at the Chernobyl disaster of 1986, which galvanised her to \nreflect on the ecological dangers posed by a culture that is (in some sense) severed from \nnature. \nIrigaray begins by pointing to a widespread cultural unease which, she thinks, has \ncrystallised around Chernobyl. Prior to Chernobyl, one could imagine that nature would \nregulate and alleviate the ill-effects of human activities. But, Irigaray rather oddly claims, \u2018at \nChernobyl, nature turned out to be a vehicle of greater destruction than any war\u2019 (TD, 3). She \nadds that this destruction stemmed from a \u2018combination of \u2026 artificial pollution and natural \nphenomena: hails, storms, even sun\u2019 (4). These claims are puzzling: surely Chernobyl was a \nthoroughly human-made disaster? Irigaray seems to believe that the destructiveness of the \nevent was so great \u2013 that \u2018the cultural disorder into which we are being drawn \u2026 has become \n[so] intolerable\u2019 \u2013 as to draw nature itself into the same destructive cycle that characterises \nhuman culture. Ultimately, then, Irigaray regards Chernobyl as reflecting the deeper-lying \nproblem that western culture is fundamentally destructive, towards nature particularly. \nIrigaray maintains that this destructiveness reflects the fact that western culture has been \ncreated by and for men.8 She writes: \u2018This warlike method of organizing society is not self-\nevident. Its origin is patriarchal. It is sexuate [sexu\u00e9e]\u2019 (5) \u2013 or, as she later states, \u2018society \u2026 \nhas certain characteristics which pass for universal but are in fact attributable to the sex of the \npeople that compose it\u2019 (17).  \nIrigaray goes on to claim that this masculine or patriarchal culture evinces a \npreoccupation with death and destruction while persistently neglecting, and failing to reflect \nupon, the primary importance for all human beings of their birth and dependency upon their \n 6 \nmothers in early infancy.9 She then enumerates some further features of patriarchal culture \u2013 \nits suppression of mother-daughter relationships10 and its tendency to deny women legal \nrights \u2013 but the fundamental task generated by her opening analysis is to explain in what way \nthe destructiveness of western culture reflects its specifically masculine character. Her \nexplanation unfolds in two stages.  \nFirstly, Irigaray suggests that patriarchal culture has its roots in the particular \ndifficulties of male infants in negotiating separation from their mothers (separation in the \ndual sense of birth and of the gradual process of becoming independent and forming a \nseparate sense of self). According to Irigaray, this process of separation is inescapably painful \nfor all infants \u2013 she speaks of the \u2018the losses and scars involved in the separations from that \nfirst home \u2026 The wound we cannot heal, and cannot cure, is the cutting of the umbilical \ncord\u2019 (SG, 16). But, for boys, this separation is especially painful, because boys are \noverwhelmingly aware of their sexual difference from their mothers. In contrast, girls \nexperience themselves as being of the same sex as their mothers \u2013 as Irigaray puts it: \n\u2018Woman \u2026 immediately becomes a subject in relation to another subject who is the same as \nshe: her mother\u2019 (TD, 19). Consequently, girls face the rather different difficulty of learning \nto combine their shared sexual identity with a resilient sense of individual difference from \ntheir mothers.11 Boys, for their part, have an immediate experience of sexual difference, \nwhich is painful because it makes the loss of their mothers much more profound. Irigaray \nclarifies this later on in Thinking the Difference: \u2018the son does not know how to situate \nhimself in regard to the person who engendered him with no possible reciprocity. He cannot \nconceive in himself \u2026 The situation is different for the daughter, who is potentially mother\u2019 \n(TD, 110-111).  \nIrigaray develops the same point more fully in an interview for Hypatia: \n 7 \nThe relation of the little boy to his mother is different from the little girl\u2019s \nrelation. The little boy, in order to situate himself vis-\u00e0-vis the mother, must \nhave a strategy, \u2026 because he finds himself in an extremely difficult situation. \nHe\u2019s a little boy. He has come out of a woman who\u2019s different from him. He \nhimself will never be able to engender, to give birth. He is therefore in a space of \nunfathomable mystery. He must invent a strategy to keep himself from being \nsubmerged, engulfed. For the little girl it\u2019s entirely different. She\u2019s a little \nwoman born of another woman. She is able to engender like her mother (JLI, \n107-108). \nGirls, then, can adapt to losing their mothers because they experience themselves as having \nthe same corporeal abilities as their mothers, which ensures some continuity. Lacking this \nexperience, boys must adopt a variety of coping strategies. Chief among these is to deny or \ndisavow ever being dependent upon, or closely imbricated with, their mothers. This denial \nforces boys to disavow, in turn, their own corporeality, which bears testimony to dependency \nand finitude. Irigaray calls this whole strategy the \u2018murder\u2019 of the mother \u2013 not (usually) a \nliteral murder, but an attitude of denying the mother\u2019s significance, and even existence, at a \nsymbolic level.12 Underneath this murderous attitude lingers a fantasy of fusion with and \nproximity to the mother, a fantasy which boys\/men never relinquish (precisely because they \nnever acknowledge it), and which surreptitiously invades and blights all their relations with \nwomen. \nIrigaray\u2019s account of male difficulties in separating from the mother might be thought \nto rely on the implausible view that boys cannot tolerate separation from their mothers \nbecause they know that they will never be able to give birth (whereas girls know that they \nwill be able to). This is implausible both because some girls will never be able to give birth \nand because young children are reasonably thought to lack knowledge of their future \n 8 \nreproductive abilities. However, Irigaray fundamentally understands the ability (and inability) \nto give birth as functions of women\u2019s (and men\u2019s) distinctive rhythms, the distinctive \ntemporal patterns which govern the development of their experience and capacities (TD, 114-\n115).13 Thus, the sexual difference that boys experience is the difference between their \nrhythm and that of their mothers, where boys\u2019 particular rhythm structures and pervades their \nexperience without them having any (conceptual) knowledge of what this rhythm is or \nsignifies. If there genuinely are differences between sexuate rhythms as Irigaray believes, \nthen it is plausible to think that boys will experience their own rhythm as different from that \nof their mothers, and that this experience must aggravate existing difficulties with separation. \nMoreover, boys\u2019\/men\u2019s resultant strategy of symbolically murdering the mother can be \nexpected to engender a destructive culture because, much of the time, boys\/men will seek to \nnegate and erase whatever is corporeal and natural. Boys\/men will let this destructiveness \npersist unchecked because they remain trapped in a fantasy according to which the natural, \ncorporeal, and (by association) maternal remains ever-present and indestructible (precisely \nthat collective fantasy which Irigaray sees as threatened by the severity of the Chernobyl \ndisaster). \nThinking the Difference offers an additional account of how western cultural \ndestructiveness is masculine: this culture is rooted in male sexuality, which, Irigaray claims, \nobeys a different pattern to female sexuality, that of \u2018tension, release and return to \nhomoeostasis\u2019 (TD, 21). She maintains that this sexuality impels men to engage in destructive \nmodes of behaviour that seek to raise tensions to breaking point. Irigaray finds this reflected, \nespecially, in modern technology, which (in its incessant noise, for example) intrudes \ndisrespectfully upon the natural rhythms of human bodies. Notably, Irigaray\u2019s analysis of \nmale sexuality implies that it generates practices and technologies which operate \ndetrimentally to other elements of male embodiment. It appears that, for Irigaray, male \n 9 \ncorporeality turns against itself, some aspects of this corporeality perpetrating violence upon \nothers. \nPotentially problematically, Irigaray appears to assume that male sexuality has a \ndeterminate character independently of any cultural mediation. We should bear in mind, \nthough, that Irigaray again regards male sexuality as a function of men\u2019s distinctive rhythm. \nIn this way, she understands sexual difference not primarily as biological but as a difference \nin men\u2019s and women\u2019s being \u2013 where being is not an entity, but the process of emergence of \nabilities, forms of experience, and anatomical structures, a process which differs between the \nsexes in respect of its temporal rhythm.14 For Irigaray, this difference in sexuate being exists \nnaturally. Following the later Heidegger, Irigaray thinks of being both as the event or process \nthrough which entities emerge, and as ultimately identical with nature (reconceived according \nto its original Greek definition as physis).15 Irigaray does, therefore, believe in natural \ndifferences between men and women, existing prior to any cultural mediation. But this is not \nmere na\u00efvety on her part, and involves no uncritical acceptance of the discourse of biology. \nRather, Irigaray believes in natural differences according to a distinctively philosophical \nreconception of nature. This philosophical reconception of nature informs her understanding \nof the nature\/culture relationship in Thinking the Difference, which we can now begin to draw \nout. \nIrigaray believes that male nature has generated a culture which opposes itself to \nnature, including to female bodies and to male bodies qua natural. There is, then, a part of \nnature \u2013 the male sex \u2013 which turns against itself. Western culture arises in this turning of \n(the male part of) nature against itself, thereby acquiring the enduring form of an anti-natural, \necologically damaging, culture. Irigaray\u2019s derivation of key features of western culture from \nmale nature thus forms part of a careful attempt to avoid reifying culture as something \nindependent of nature, and to understand culture, instead, as an internal torsion within the \n 10 \nnatural. This intriguing reconceptualisation of culture \u2013 and, concomitantly, of nature as self-\nopposing \u2013 remains only implicit in Irigaray\u2019s analysis of destructive culture in Thinking the \nDifference, but it becomes relatively explicit in To Be Two. \nIn the latter text, Irigaray opens her consideration of nature and culture by quoting the \nchoral song from Sophocles\u2019 tragedy Antigone which begins (in the translation she uses): \n\u2018There is much that is uncanny, but nothing that surpasses man in uncanniness\u2019. Heidegger is \nIrigaray\u2019s primary interlocutor here: he discusses this chorus in his 1935 lecture course \nIntroduction to Metaphysics, to which Irigaray is critically responding.16 However, in the \nbackground to her response is a further level of engagement with Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin, whose \nthinking about humanity centrally informs Heidegger\u2019s discussion of Sophocles. Although \nH\u00f6lderlin is not, in general, an obvious interlocutor of Irigaray\u2019s, references to him occur \nsporadically throughout her oeuvre; in This Sex Which Is Not One, she proposed to teach a \nhistory of readings of Antigone, including that of H\u00f6lderlin, who translated this drama.17 \nMoreover, Irigaray is aware of Heidegger\u2019s debt to H\u00f6lderlin, so that her response to \nHeidegger inevitably encompasses H\u00f6lderlin as well. To understand Irigaray\u2019s consideration \nof the nature\/culture relation in To Be Two, then, we must first gain an overview of \nH\u00f6lderlin\u2019s speculations on this topic.18 We can then explore how these speculations \ninfluence Heidegger, and how Irigaray eventually responds to both thinkers. \n \n2. H\u00f6lderlin, nature, and the human  \nH\u00f6lderlin\u2019s thinking about nature arose in the context of early German Romanticism, which \naspired to overcome the modern disenchantment of nature by producing art which would re-\ninfuse nature with \u2018beauty, magic and mystery\u2019.19 H\u00f6lderlin became increasingly critical of \nthis project of re-enchanting nature through art, which he came to find anthropocentric, \npresupposing the same separation between humanity and nature that it purported to \n 11 \novercome. H\u00f6lderlin\u2019s increasingly critical attitude to Romanticism reveals his deepening \nconviction that humanity\u2019s very separation from nature arises through a natural process \u2013 \nhumanity being merely the site where nature turns against itself. This conviction of \nH\u00f6lderlin\u2019s becomes crucial for Heidegger and, in turn, Irigaray.  \nH\u00f6lderlin\u2019s thinking about humanity\u2019s status within nature represents the progressive \nworking out of his early theoretical reflections on nature, especially those contained in his \ncrucial early fragment \u2018Judgement and Being\u2019. Here H\u00f6lderlin argues that all consciousness \ninvolves the subject relating to objects via judgement, through which it distinguishes these \nobjects from itself. For H\u00f6lderlin, consciousness as a subject-object relation necessarily \npresupposes a prior unity of subject and object, a unity which is no mere synthesis but an \nabsolute unification which precedes any distinction. This unity is, he states, \u2018Being [which] \nexpresses the combination of subject and object. Where subject and object are directly, not \njust partially, united, \u2026 there and nowhere else can there be talk of being as such\u2019.20 \nHowever, this \u2018blessed unity, being\u2019 cannot be known.21 We cannot be conscious of being, \nbecause all consciousness requires experience of objects from which we differentiate \nourselves as subjects \u2013 a differentiation which is absent within being. Insofar as we are \nconscious, judging subjects, being is lost to us. Now, unitary being, H\u00f6lderlin also maintains, \nis nature. He equates original being with nature because he relies on the ancient Greek \nunderstanding of nature as physis, that which \u2018loves to hide\u2019.22 Because being is always \ndisappearing, receding behind the separation between objects and subjects, being can be said \nto \u2018love to hide\u2019, and so can be identified with nature. As J. M. Bernstein sums up, \u2018nature as \nthe ground of the human cannot appear because it would have to be judged, but if judged, \nthen it is already in a state of dispersion\u2019.23 We can experience nature only as the realm of \nobjects standing over against us, but cannot experience that prior nature which is united with \nus; as conscious, we have always already lost that originary nature.  \n 12 \nThrough this analysis, H\u00f6lderlin identifies the disenchantment of nature as an \ninescapable consequence of reflection, where reflectiveness itself is an ineluctable \nconcomitant of human consciousness. As his character Hyperion laments, \u2018an instant of \nreflection hurls me down. I reflect, and \u2026 the world in its eternal oneness is gone; nature \ncloses her arms, and I stand like an alien before her and do not understand her\u2019.24 For \nH\u00f6lderlin, our conscious reflectiveness as humans marks us out as distinctively cultural, \nhistorical, beings, who are inherently estranged from nature. Despite the fact that nature is \ntherefore unknowable for us, H\u00f6lderlin believes that we retain some sense of it as our basis \nand origin, for which we are always nostalgic. Consciousness, separation, and reflection \npresuppose an original unity of which we necessarily retain some vestigial awareness. This \nawareness impels us to strive to reunite with nature \u2013 \u2018To reunite ourselves with nature, with \na unique infinite totality, is the goal of all our strivings\u2019.25  \nFrom the later 1790s onwards, H\u00f6lderlin developed his thoughts on human separation \nfrom nature by theorising ancient Greek tragedy. \u2018The significance of tragedies\u2019 (1802) \nconceives the tragic hero as compelled to reunite with nature: Empedocles, for example, \nsought unity with nature and eventually flung himself into Mount Etna to achieve it. \nHowever, in drafting and redrafting his own tragedy The Death of Empedocles, H\u00f6lderlin \ncame to identify two possible responses to separation from nature. The first, Greek, response \n\u2013 that of Empedocles \u2013 is to dissolve the self and die. The second response is the \u2018Hesperian\u2019, \nwhich defines western Europe after the decline of classical Greece, and which accepts the \nliving death of separation from nature.26 H\u00f6lderlin came to see the Hesperian response as \nmore appropriate, finding the Greek attitude hubristic, premised on an inflated assessment of \nhumanity\u2019s status within the cosmos. H\u00f6lderlin never systematically argues for the Hesperian \nresponse, but we can reconstruct why it becomes appropriate given the logic of his earlier \nthinking concerning nature. \n 13 \nIf humanity is originally wholly one with nature, then their separation cannot arise \nfrom any activity on the part of humanity just as such. This separation must arise from nature, \nwith which humanity is initially united. Nature must divide itself \u2013 into humanity on one side, \nand an objectified derivative of itself on the other. To construe ourselves, human beings, as \nresponsible for this division is to presume our capacity to act independently of nature as a \nwhole \u2013 when in fact, H\u00f6lderlin says, \u2018all the \u2026 streams of human activity \u2026 have their \nsource in nature\u2019.27 From H\u00f6lderlin\u2019s perspective, then, it must be inappropriate for humanity \nto attempt to overcome separation (whether through suicide or artistic projects of re-\nenchantment). To suppose that humanity can overcome separation is to assume that humanity \ncan act independently of nature (so as to oppose the self-division which nature has initiated). \nEven though all striving for unity is a striving to dissolve one\u2019s humanity, this striving \nremains, ultimately, premised upon anthropocentric assumptions. In fact, according to \nH\u00f6lderlin\u2019s thinking, we have become separated from nature by its power alone, so it is not \nwithin our power to undo separation.28 The appropriately modest response is to recognise our \ndependence and hence to endure separation \u2013 to wait, patiently, until nature may change its \nmode of being. Humanity, H\u00f6lderlin increasingly comes to believe, must undergo the \nsuffering of division from nature. \nHaving previously positioned humanity as distinctly non- or anti-natural, H\u00f6lderlin \nincreasingly draws out how nature persists within the non-naturalness of humanity. For \nH\u00f6lderlin, humanity is non-natural just because it is the place where nature divides itself, \nsplits within itself. The human condition of opposition to nature is inflicted upon humanity by \nnature. H\u00f6lderlin thus understands humanity as naturally non-natural, reciprocally \nconceiving nature as self-opposing, self-dividing. This understanding of humanity may be \ncharacterised as thoroughly non-anthropocentric, in that it traces even humanity\u2019s anti-\n 14 \nnatural, cultural, proclivities back to (self-dividing) nature. This thoroughly non-\nanthropocentric view of humanity becomes decisive for Heidegger and Irigaray. \n \n3. Irigaray\u2019s response to H\u00f6lderlin and Heidegger \nIn his Introduction to Metaphysics, Heidegger comments on the choral ode to Sophocles\u2019 \nAntigone while discussing the essence of the human. He aims to return to the original, ancient \nGreek, definition of human being, a poetic definition which he finds expressed in the writings \nof Heraclitus, Parmenides, and in Antigone. Heidegger takes as Antigone\u2019s central definition \nthat humanity is to deinotaton, which he translates as the \u2018most uncanny\u2019 (Unheimlichste). \nHumanity is singularly uncanny because it is the point at which nature (as physis) divides \nagainst itself. Although Heidegger does not mention H\u00f6lderlin at this point in the lecture \ncourse, H\u00f6lderlin\u2019s understanding of the human is evidently in the background  \u2013 especially \nsince Heidegger refers earlier to H\u00f6lderlin\u2019s unsurpassed understanding of \u2018the great age of \nGreek beginnings\u2019.29 Nonetheless, Heidegger departs from H\u00f6lderlin in giving central place \nto humanity\u2019s violence (Gewalt), as we will see. \nHeidegger begins by exploring the Greek concept of deinon, translated as uncanny or \nterrible. Firstly, being or physis is uncanny because it is irreducible to beings (it is the event \nof their emergence which, preceding all beings, cannot be properly said to \u2018be\u2019). Heidegger \nalso describes being in its emergent, eruptive, character as violent, as the \u2018overwhelming \nsway\u2019 (\u00fcberw\u00e4ltigende Walten). Humanity derives from physis and, as such, is violent too. \nHowever, humanity is distinguished in being violent towards the rest of the beings that \nemerge physically: humanity (as Sophocles tells us) intrudes violently into sea and earth, \nforcibly tames and exploits animals, and, above all, masters beings as a whole by imposing \nintelligibility upon them. Humanity, then, is the place at which the violence of physis turns \nupon itself, which makes humanity the most uncanny. As Susan Schoenbohm explains \n 15 \nHeidegger\u2019s thought: \u2018As human, the violent is a power of physis, \u2026 indeed, the power of \nphysis, which uses violence against itself; that the overwhelming sway turns against itself \ncharacterises the power of physis\u2019.30 Whereas H\u00f6lderlin focused on humanity\u2019s separation \nfrom nature without defining this separation as per se violent, Heidegger foregrounds the \nviolence both of physis and of humanity towards other beings. He envisions humanity as \ndestined to actively struggle with other beings (primarily through the intellectual and poetic \nstruggle to wrest intelligibility from them). \nHeidegger also stresses that humanity is destined to misunderstand its violent powers \nas manifesting its independent agency (when in fact, these powers are really powers of \nphysis). In \u2018his\u2019 very resourcefulness and violence, the human being cannot but mistake \u2018the \npower which pervades him, which alone enables him to be a man\u2019 (IM, 156) for a power that \n\u2018he\u2019 has somehow brought about through his own resources. But because, in fact, humanity\u2019s \npower derives from physis, humanity is destined to be defeated by physis in its struggle \nagainst it. Each human being, then, must die; through death, there occurs a closing up of the \n\u2018breach\u2019 within being that humanity represents (124). However, Heidegger suggests the \npossibility of embracing one\u2019s death, by actively wrestling against nature while knowing that \nthe struggle is doomed. Whereas H\u00f6lderlin counselled acceptance of our limits, Heidegger \nurges violence towards the beings of nature; he cannot at this point concede the worth of any \nnon-violent ways of relating to other physical beings.31  \nHeidegger\u2019s emphasis on violence enables Irigaray to connect H\u00f6lderlin\u2019s conception \nof humanity\u2019s place in nature with her analysis of western destructiveness and its specifically \nmasculine character. \u2018Between Us, a Fabricated World\u2019 largely adopts Irigaray\u2019s well-known \nmimetic style, beginning by quoting the Sophoclean ode and then paraphrasing portions of \nHeidegger\u2019s commentary upon it. Irigaray writes, \u2018Man upsets the rhythm of natural growth. \nHe plows the earth and obliges it to produce by force what it does not yield on its own \u2026 \n 16 \nMan imposes a yoke upon the life that unfolds in itself but whose foundations he does not \ninhabit\u2019 (TBT, 69). Man is the inqui\u00e9tante being who breaks out of the nature to which he \nwas originally enslaved and dominates it, instituting a second, cultural and historical, world \n(70). Following Heidegger, Irigaray adds that man becomes \u2018exiled\u2019 and \u2018estranged\u2019 from his \nbeing in this cultural world, inevitably coming to identify himself as the creator of this entire \nsphere, when, \u2018in fact, he has only imitated the strength of the universe which surrounds him \n\u2026 man\u2019s mastery resembles the natural strength with which he wishes to measure himself\u2019. \nHis strength and violence are really that of nature, operating through him.  \nBesides paraphrasing Heidegger, Irigaray distances herself subtly from him (and, \nindirectly, from H\u00f6lderlin) by highlighting the sexually differentiated nature of the humanity \nthrough whom nature enacts violence upon itself. At first, she uses Heidegger\u2019s language of \n\u2018man\u2019 mimetically, but, as her essay unfolds, she marks increasingly firmly that male \nhumanity is in question, not humans per se. Thus, she states that the violence of culture \u2018can \nbe explained beginning from a masculine subjectivity\u2019 (TBT, 76). She also writes that: \nThe feminine is not called to carry out the task of constructing a world which is \nsimilar to man\u2019s: a violent, uncanny world, which exists through the domination \nof nature \u2026 To \u2026 cultivate herself without violence or power over what \nsurrounds her \u2013 all of these correspond more to feminine being. (72)  \nIrigaray suggests that men are violent due to their special difficulty in accepting sexual \ndifference: \u2018man chooses to ignore this irreducible difference \u2026 Is this not because he feels \nforeign to this life which lives without him, this life which reproduces itself \u2026 ?\u2019 (70) Or, as \nshe states later on, man\u2019s violence is \u2018probably related to man\u2019s relationship with the one who \ngenerates him: he will never generate in himself and must fabricate things outside of himself, \nin order to separate himself from the mother; he must manufacture externally, while she \ngenerates internally\u2019 (76). For Irigaray (drawing on her earlier analysis in Thinking the \n 17 \nDifference), it is men\u2019s difficulty in accepting sexual difference which leads them to turn \nagainst women, and, simultaneously, against the nature of which they themselves are part \u2013 \nas when men engineer technologies which damage their own nature. \nWhile Irigaray agrees with H\u00f6lderlin and Heidegger that nature turns against itself, \nshe holds that only males mediate this turn. Man\u2019s, but not woman\u2019s, nature is to be uncanny \nand violent. Through men\u2019s activities, women become embroiled in a non-natural mode of \nlife that is fundamentally alien to them. Evidently, Irigaray can only identify men as the sole \nmediators of nature\u2019s violence because she believes in an original sexual differentiation \nwithin nature (against which men, as one pole of this differentiation, react). This contrasts \nwith H\u00f6lderlin\u2019s view of nature as original, absolute, unity. Believing in an originary \ndifferentiation, Irigaray understands male violence to consist, typically, in the forcible \nimposition of sameness upon women and other natural beings. H\u00f6lderlin, on the other hand, \nconceives humans as separated from nature insofar as their power of judgement leads them to \ndivide, analyse, and reflectively partition natural beings. But for Irigaray, H\u00f6lderlin\u2019s \nconception of nature as primordially unitary instantiates the same disavowal of sexual \ndifference which underpins male hostility to nature. By denying originary difference, \nH\u00f6lderlin\u2019s account of nature becomes complicit with the very separation from nature that he \nwishes to question.32  \nIrigaray\u2019s belief in an originary sexual differentiation makes nature\u2019s turning against \nitself considerably less mysterious than it is for H\u00f6lderlin. The opening up of a division \nwithin primordial unity must necessarily be a mysterious event, since this unity itself contains \nno grounds for diremption. In contrast, Irigaray\u2019s analyses in To Be Two and Thinking the \nDifference make it quite intelligible why the male pole of a pre-existing differentiation should \nturn, reactively, against (the rest of) nature. One might object that there remains a mystery as \nto how nature originally becomes sexually dual: that is, that Irigaray has simply pushed the \n 18 \nmysterious event of division back to reside in the movement whereby sexual difference \nnaturally emerges. However, although Irigaray does regard sexual difference as mysterious, \nshe locates its mystery precisely in its irreducibility to any prior unity (TBT, 111). \nTo Be Two deepens Irigaray\u2019s earlier analysis of male destructiveness, understanding \nthe male sex as the place where nature enacts violence upon itself. Male violence \u2013 and \npatriarchal culture, with its separation from and hostility to nature \u2013 derive from a nature \nunderstood, philosophically, both as sexually differentiated and as effecting a violent turn \nagainst itself. Irigaray does not, then, regard patriarchal culture as natural in the sense of \ngrounding it, uncritically, in biology. By drawing from H\u00f6lderlin and Heidegger an unusual \nconception of nature as self-dividing, she avoids na\u00efve biologism, but simultaneously avoids \nreifying culture as a separate, independent, sphere. Yet, in arguing that destructive culture \narises naturally, must not Irigaray construe this culture as unchangeable? Intriguingly, given \nher emphasis upon culture\u2019s natural roots, she insists throughout To Be Two that patriarchal \nculture can be changed. Let us explore this dimension of her thought. \n \n4. The place of nature in the culture of sexual difference \nIrigaray stresses that western violence represents only one possible cultural direction, an \nalternative having been taken in \u2018the Far East\u2019. More specifically, she suggests that men \ncould learn to cultivate respect for the sexually different other, and for other natural beings. \nMen could practise \u2018self-mastery\u2019 (TBT, 172) \u2013 self-restraint in the face of their desire to act \nviolently and deny difference. Yet how is this attitudinal change possible, if \u2013 as Irigaray has \nmaintained \u2013 men just are the site through which nature turns upon itself? Irigaray explains \nthat: \u2018The fact that [man\u2019s] impulses, inclinations and desires are violent does not necessarily \nmean that this is an inherent part of masculine being, but that violence can come from an \nhistorical construction\u2019 (71). Likewise, in Thinking the Difference, she maintains that men\u2019s \n 19 \ndestructiveness stems from the absence of a \u2018sexual culture, a (partially dialectical) pattern of \ncultural relations between the genders [genres]\u2019 (TD, 17). But if, after all, patriarchal culture \nexplains masculine psychical difficulties, then what explains the formation and tenacity of \npatriarchal culture? \nIrigaray\u2019s apparently contradictory statements regarding the contributions of nature \nand culture to male violence can be reconciled if she believes that men have only a natural \ntendency to violence. If so, then male violence is not inevitable, because men\u2019s destructive \ntendency will be activated or exercised only if a set of appropriate conditions is met. \nMoreover, contextual factors invariably affect how any tendency exercises itself, so that its \nmanifestation is always socially and culturally mediated, in complex, unpredictable, ways. \nThus, Irigaray need not envisage a linear causal relationship between masculine violence and \na destructive culture. Rather, men\u2019s violent tendencies will become activated in the absence \nof a sexuate culture, an absence which leaves men without resources to comprehend and \nacclimatise to sexual difference. The little boy finds himself in a space of unfathomable \nmystery only because his culture, which is non-sexuate, deprives him of ways to make sense \nof his mother\u2019s difference from himself. If femininity were instead recognised as an \nindependent identity, and masculinity were recognised as a correspondingly specific identity \nwith virtues and values of its own, then the difficulty of sexual difference would become \nnegotiable.  \nYet how can culture, which is only the effect of nature\u2019s tendency to turn against \nitself, ever affect the natural tendency from which it results? Irigaray\u2019s answer is that culture \narises as something genuinely non-natural through nature\u2019s turn against itself, a non-\nnaturalness that enables culture to act back upon the nature that sustains it. Here Irigaray \ndenies that she is falling back onto the traditional idea that culture is independent of nature \u2013 \nfor her, the anti-naturalness of culture itself arises naturally. Moreover, she also insists that a \n 20 \nsexuate culture would not oppose nature\u2019s self-opposing tendencies altogether (which would, \nafter all, be self-contradictory, for then this culture would effectively cancel itself out). \nRather, a sexuate culture would cultivate natural tendencies \u2013 transforming them and \norienting them in a new, relatively benign, direction. In particular, this culture would redirect \nmen\u2019s oppositional tendencies \u2013 their \u2018negativity\u2019 \u2013 against themselves, so as to install within \nthem a permanent check against their own destructiveness, and a stimulant to respect for the \nother and for nature.33  \nFor Irigaray, then, the violent, anti-natural, character of western culture has arisen \nthrough our own \u2013 cultural \u2013 failure to redirect nature\u2019s tendency to turn against itself. A \nsexuate culture could counteract this tendency and push it towards a new respect for alterity. \nWhereas H\u00f6lderlin counsels us to wait patiently for possible change in nature\u2019s own mode of \nbeing, Irigaray urges that we \u2013 as human, cultural, beings \u2013 should intervene to reorientate \nnature\u2019s self-destructive tendency. In these divergent recommendations, H\u00f6lderlin and \nIrigaray might at first sight appear to occupy the two poles of the dilemma with which I \nopened this paper, over whether or not we should affirm that culture has natural foundations. \nH\u00f6lderlin denies culture any independence of nature, but consequently espouses quietism. \nIrigaray advocates cultural change, but would therefore seem obliged to grant culture some \nindependent agency with respect to nature. Yet she avoids making that move: although she \nallows culture the agency to transform and cultivate nature, she does so without conceiving \nculture as independent of nature, instead reconceiving it as dependent on nature for its \nagency. This agency arises naturally, through internal division within nature. Irigaray treats \nnature as the ontologically basic element within the culture\/nature dyad, distancing herself \nfrom the masculinist tradition which typically devalues nature, depicting it as secondary to \nthe cultural, spiritual, realm. Irigaray thereby succeeds in combining a consistent refusal of \nthe masculinist nature\/culture hierarchy with advocacy of cultural change. Her thought thus \n 21 \ndissolves feminist philosophy\u2019s dilemma, opening up a way for feminists to combine support \nfor cultural change with commitment to securing renewed recognition and esteem for nature. \nIn highlighting these unique strengths of Irigaray\u2019s philosophy of sexual difference, I \ndo not mean to suggest that it is without problems. Her conception of the nature\/culture \nrelation relies on her belief in natural sexual difference, which she regards as fundamentally \nreal in a way that racial and ethnic differences are not (ILTY, 47). Her understanding of \nnatural sexual difference is also, arguably, heteronormative, implying a natural attraction \nbetween the two sexes.34 Nonetheless, I believe that these problems could be most \nproductively addressed by starting from and transforming, rather than rejecting, Irigaray\u2019s \nfruitful conception of the nature\/culture relation. I hope that this paper has shown that this \nconception is sufficiently original and important to deserve such further elaboration and \ntransformation. \n \nEndnotes \n                                                \n1 Irigaray\u2019s conception of nature is receiving growing attention from feminist scholars: see \nStacy Keltner, \u2018The Ethics of Air: Technology and the Question of Sexual Difference\u2019, \nPhilosophy Today 2001 (Supp.),53-65; Ann V.

Chodorow\u2019s claims reflect a theoretical understanding of \ngender identity as acquired through socialisation. By contrast, Irigaray\u2019s approach is \nphenomenological, beginning from the subject\u2019s experience of sexed identity.

Michael Hamburger (London: Anvil Press, 1994), 399.  \n29 Heidegger, Introduction to Metaphysics, trans. Ralph Manheim (New Haven: Yale \nUniversity Press, 1959), 126. It is worth recalling that in 1934\/5, Heidegger lectured on \nH\u00f6lderlin\u2019s hymns \u2018Germania\u2019 and \u2018The Rhine\u2019: his thinking in Introduction to Metaphysics \nis intimately connected with his appropriation of H\u00f6lderlin\u2019s poetic thought. \n30 Susan Schoenbohm, \u2018Heidegger\u2019s Interpretation of Phusis in Introduction to Metaphysics\u2019, \nin A Companion to Heidegger\u2019s Introduction to Metaphysics, ed.
