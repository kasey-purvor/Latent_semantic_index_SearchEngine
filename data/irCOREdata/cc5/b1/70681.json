We \nsuggest that whilst Evans\u2019 heuristic-analytic model and Oaksford and Chater\u2019s (e.g., \n2003) optimal data selection model can provide compelling accounts of our protocol \nfindings, the mental models theory fares less well as an explanation of our full dataset.  \n \n \nThink-Aloud Protocols   3 \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis research was conducted whilst Erica Lucas was at the University of Derby, and \nwe acknowledge the University for its financial support.

Although this \ntask appears straightforward, few people respond with logically correct selections. In its \nmost common format, participants are presented with an array of four cards, and are \ntold that each card has a letter on one side and a number on the other side (only the \nfacing sides are visible). Participants are then given a conditional rule that they are told \napplies to the cards, and their task is to decide which cards need to be turned over in \norder to determine whether the rule is true or false. For example, the rule might be \u2018If \nthere is an A on one side of the card then there is a 3 on the other side of the card\u2019, and \nthe cards might be \u2018A\u2019 \u2018J\u2019, \u20183\u2019 and \u20187\u2019. These are referred to as the p, not-p, q and not-q \ncards, respectively (p and not-p are antecedent cases and q and not-q are consequent \ncases). The logically correct response for a conditional reading of the rule is to turn the \nA (p) and the 7 (not-q) cards, as these could potentially provide a letter-number \ncombination that would show the rule to be false. For a biconditional reading of the rule \nit would be necessary to select all four cards to check for a falsifying letter-number \ncombination. Most people, however, select either A (p) alone, or A (p) and 3 (q). \nTo explain these choices, Wason (e.g., Wason & Johnson-Laird, 1972) suggested \nthat people were displaying a verification bias, whereby they were trying to prove the \nrule true (by finding a card with the A and 3 combination), rather than trying to prove it \nfalse, as logic necessitates. However, Evans and Lynch (1973) demonstrated that when \nnegative components are introduced into the conditional people\u2019s selections indicate a \nsystematic matching bias rather than a verification bias, in that they simply seem to \nThink-Aloud Protocols   5 \n \nchoose cards that are named in the given rule. Matching bias is a robust phenomenon in \nselection tasks employing abstract rules incorporating the following connectives: if p \nthen q, q if p, p only if q, and there is not both p and q (e.g., Evans, Clibbens, & Rood, \n1996; Evans, Legrenzi, & Girotto, 1999). Recently, too, Roberts (2002) has \ndemonstrated similar levels of matching to that seen with conditionals in selection tasks \ninvolving categorical rules of the form all p have q. Finally, matching has been \nobserved in paradigms other than the selection task such as truth table tasks -- where \npeople have either to identify or construct instances that verify, falsify, or are irrelevant \nto a given conditional or categorical rule (e.g., Evans, 1998b; Evans et al., 1999).  \nDespite the apparent generality of the matching phenomenon there is some \nremaining contention as to whether it extends beyond conditional and categorical rule \nforms to rules such as inclusive disjunctions (either not p or q, or both) and exclusive \ndisjunctions (either not p or q, but not both). Evidence from truth table tasks suggests \nsuch generality (Evans et al., 1999; Evans & Newstead, 1980), whilst evidence from \ndisjunctive selection tasks is highly inconsistent: Evans et al. (1999) observed weaker \nmatching effects than arise with other rule forms; Krauth and Berchtold-Neumann \n(1988) found no matching with inclusive disjunctions but an effect with exclusive \ndisjunctions; and Roberts (2002) demonstrated inverted matching (i.e. reliably fewer \nmatching than mismatching selections). We concur with Roberts\u2019 (2002, p. 96) view \nthat the safest inference from current findings is probably that there is no matching \neffect on disjunctive selections tasks, and that the idea that matching is a general \nlinguistic phenomenon (e.g., Evans\u2019, 1998b) is uncertain in as much as it may only \noccur for conditional and categorical statements that have an inherent directionality. \n \n \nThink-Aloud Protocols   6 \n \nTheoretical Accounts of Matching Bias in the Selection Task \nThree reasoning theories of major contemporary importance have been applied to \nselection tasks involving abstract conditionals in an attempt to explain people\u2019s choices, \nincluding the dominant matching pattern. Evans\u2019 heuristic-analytic (henceforth H-A) \ntheory (e.g., Evans, 1989, 1996) proposes that reasoning involves two distinct \nprocessing stages. First, implicit, pre-conscious, heuristics determine which aspects of a \ngiven task are of psychological relevance, thereby enabling attention to be selectively \nfocused on these task features. Second, explicit, conscious, analytic processes are \napplied to these relevant task features in order for an inference or judgment to be made. \nEvans\u2019 (1998b) specific account of matching bias on the selection task is that it arises \nfrom the operation of a linguistically-based matching heuristic, which reflects the way \nin which negative terms are used in natural language to deny suppositions rather than to \nassert new information. The essential idea is that a negative statement is a comment that \ndoes not alter the topic of an assertion (e.g., a statement such as \u201cthere is not a 3\u201d is still \nabout the number 3 rather than any other number)1. Evans also proposes that another \nheuristic, the if heuristic, arises in the context of conditional selection tasks, and causes \nattention to be focused on the true antecedent (TA) card for all rules. This heuristic \nexplains why there is a good level of logical performance for TA cards (which should \nalways be selected), and why the matching response is less marked for negated \nantecedent rules compared with affirmative antecedent ones. \nEvans\u2019 account of selection task performance is, therefore, attentional in emphasis. \nLinguistic cues draw attention toward certain cards and away from others; the former \nget selected and the latter get rejected. Any analytic processing that is applied serves \nmerely to rationalize decisions that have already been made on the basis of relevance \n(Evans, 1995). In this way, the H-A account can readily make sense of the finding \nThink-Aloud Protocols   7 \n \n(Evans & Wason, 1976) that the retrospective verbal reports that people provide when \nasked to explain their card selections appear to reflect attempts to justify choices in \nterms of either verification or falsification (depending on the nature of the rule), with no \napparent insight being displayed into the logical basis of selections. \nJohnson-Laird and Byrne\u2019s (1991) mental models theory proposes that reasoning is \nbased around the construction of models in which the premises of an argument or rule \nare represented as being true. To explain selection-task performance, this theory \nassumes that people: (1) only think about those cards that are explicitly represented in \ntheir models of the rule, and (2) only select those cards for which the hidden value \ncould bear on the truth or falsity of the rule. So, for example, the failure to select the \nnot-q card on If p then q reflects the fact that this term is not explicitly represented in \nthe reasoner\u2019s models of the conditional, thereby resulting in the common selection of \njust the p card with this affirmative rule. Those people who represent this rule as a \nbiconditional would select p and q (the other dominant selection combination for an \naffirmative rule), as both of these cards are explicitly represented in models and could \nhave a bearing on the rule\u2019s truth or falsity. To account for matching bias on rules that \ncontain negations, Johnson-Laird and Byrne (1991) argue that negated components \npromote the expansion of models to include the affirmative counterparts of negated \nterms. For example, If A then not 3 would be represented as: \n[A]    \u00ac 3 \n       3 \n\u2026 \nIn this notation, each line depicts a different model which could be true if one \nassumes the truth of the conditional. The square brackets around \u2018A\u2019 in the first model \ndenote that this proposition is exhausted with respect to \u00ac3 (i.e., that whenever an A \nThink-Aloud Protocols   8 \n \noccurs a \u00ac3 also occurs). The second model is incomplete in that whether or not an A \nwould occur given that there is a 3 has not been represented by the reasoner. In the third \nline, the ellipses denote an \u201cimplicit\u201d model, meaning that there may be other models \nconsistent with the rule to which the reasoner has not assigned explicit content. Central \nto the mental models theory of deduction is the notion that people have limited \nworking-memory capacities, and hence will represent as little as possible in their initial \nmodel-set to capture the meaning of the connective if. Within the model-set for If A \nthen not 3, it is only the A and the 3 cards whose hidden values could bear on its truth \nor falsity if it is treated as a conditional. It is, therefore, these cards that will be selected, \nso producing a matching response pattern.  \nThe mental models theory of selection-task performance has some similarities to the \nH-A account (cf. Evans, 1998b). For example, the concept of explicit representation in \nmodels clearly overlaps with Evans\u2019 (e.g., 1989) notion of relevance (i.e., what is \nexplicitly represented in a model is what the individual perceives to be of relevance to \nthe task at hand). However, the model theory differs critically from the H-A account in \nits assumption that a degree of analytic processing does determine card selections (i.e., \nthe only cards that end up being chosen are those explicitly represented ones that are \ndeemed to bear on the rule\u2019s truth or falsity).  \nA third theory of selection-task performance, forwarded by Oaksford and Chater \n(e.g., 1994, 1996; see also Oaksford & Chater, 2003), is framed within their general \nrational-analysis approach to human reasoning, and is referred to as the optimal data \nselection (ODS) account. Oaksford and Chater propose that selections are based on the \ninformation value of cards in relation to their potential support for the rule, estimated in \nthe form of expected information gain. Oaksford and Chater\u2019s mathematical analysis of \nthe information value of cards shows, for example, that the selection of the matching q \nThink-Aloud Protocols   9 \n \ncard for the affirmative conditional can be more useful than the selection of the non-\nmatching (but logically appropriate) not-q card2. In this way, the ODS model proposes \nthat illogical matching choices may, in fact, be deemed to be rational in terms of a \nprobabilistic standard.  \nThe ODS theory presents a persuasive account of the matching effects observed on \naffirmative conditional rules within the selection task. Moreover, because the ODS \ntheory capitalizes on Oaksford and Stenning\u2019s (1992) arguments that negations typically \ndefine high-probability contrast sets, it is also readily able to explain antecedent and \nconsequent matching effects observed for conditional rules containing negated \nconstituents (e.g., Oaksford, 2002a; Yama, 2001). So, for example, a rule such as If \nthere is an A on one side of the card then there is not a 3 on the other side is argued to \ndesignate a high probability true consequent category (any number that is not a 3), \nwhereas the false consequent category is represented by a very low probability single \ncase (the matching 3 card), whose rarity assures its high information value.  \nOverall, then, the ODS account is able to accommodate a wide range of evidence for \nmatching effects in the standard selection task paradigm. A final strength of the theory -\n- and one which sets it apart from both the H-A and the mental models accounts -- is its \ncapacity to explain the considerable body of evidence that has now been amassed for \nprobabilistic influences on card selections (e.g., Green & Over, 1997; Green, Over, & \nPyne, 1997; Kirby, 1994; Oaksford, Chater, & Grainger, 1999; Oaksford, Chater, \nGrainger & Larkin, 1997). So, for example, it has been shown that card selections vary \nin ways predicted by ODS when P(p) and P(q) are varied experimentally. Non-\nprobabilistic theories are generally not readily able to explain why probability \nmanipulations should affect card selections, only really being able to do so by invoking \nthe idea that participants adopt different task interpretations, with probabilistic \nThink-Aloud Protocols   10 \n \nmanipulations affecting the proportion of people adopting these different interpretations \n(see Oaksford & Wakefield, 2003).  \nIn spite of the capacity of the ODS theory to explain an impressive range of  \nselection-task data, it has been claimed to have certain limitations. One problem (cf. \nEvans, 2002) is the difficulty that the theory appears to have in explaining why the use \nof explicit negations on cards in selection tasks completely removes matching bias (e.g., \nEvans et al., 1996). This phenomenon is easily accounted for by the H-A theory, as all \ncards present matching values within an explicit negations paradigm. Oaksford (2002a), \nhowever, has recently proposed that this explicit negations effect may be a result of \nparticipants failing to engage their \u201cnormal\u201d interpretative processes in this task variant \n--  an explanation that is certainly worthy of further investigation.     \nTests of Theoretical Accounts of Matching Bias \nRoberts (1998b) has commented that only limited attempts have been made to test \ndirectly theories of selection-task performance through the production of converging \nevidence beyond actual card-selection patterns. Moreover, what effort has been made in \nthis respect has primarily been driven by researchers working within the H-A \nframework. For example, Evans, Ball and Brooks (1987) used computer-presented tasks \nand recorded the order in which \u201cselect-don\u2019t select\u201d decisions were made about each \ncard. As predicted by the H-A account, people made decisions about matching cards \nbefore mismatching ones, and a correlation was found between card selection frequency \nand card decision order (i.e., selected cards were decided about earlier than rejected \nones). However, it is possible that these results simply reflect a preference for people to \nregister \u201cselect\u201d choices before \u201cdon\u2019t select\u201d ones, and that what is being shown is a \nresponse bias as opposed to an attentional bias (Evans, Newstead & Byrne, 1993; \nRoberts, 1998b). \nThink-Aloud Protocols   11 \n \nEvans (1996) provided stronger evidence for the H-A account in two studies using a \nmouse-pointing methodology to record card- inspection times. Participants were \nrequired to tackle computer-generated selection tasks, and to indicate cards they were \n\u201cthinking about\u201d by holding the mouse pointer over that card. Cards were selected by \nmeans of a mouse-click, whilst no action was required for non-selected cards. The \ncomputer logged cumulative inspection times for each of the four cards on a given \nproblem. Evans argued that if heuristic processes were cueing card selections, then only \nsuch heuristically-cued cards would be subjected to analytic rationalization processes \naimed at justifying their selection. Inspection-times would, therefore, be higher for \nselected cards than for rejected cards. The specific predictions that Evans tested were: \n(P1) cards associated with higher selection rates will be associated with longer \ninspection times, and (P2) for a given card, participants who choose it will have longer \ninspection times than those who do not. Evans (1996) found strong support for both \npredictions. There were often sizeable differences in mean inspection times between \nselected and non-selected cards, with the former generally being greater than 4 s and the \nlatter typically being less than 2 s.  \nDespite this converging evidence for the H-A account of the selection task, Roberts \n(1998b) has noted a need for caution in interpreting findings that derive from Evans\u2019 \ncard-inspection paradigm. In particular, Roberts argued that there are three potential \nsources of bias inherent in this paradigm that could have led to artefactual support for \nthe cla im that people are spending time rationalizing choices that have been cued by \nrelevance-determining heuristics. First, participants may have a tendency to pause the \nmouse pointer over a card for a brief period of time before making an active \u201cselect\u201d \ndecis ion about it (by clicking on it). This would lead to inflated inspection times for \nselected cards relative to non-selected ones. Second, participants may forget to move \nThink-Aloud Protocols   12 \n \nthe mouse pointer to a new card even though their attention has shifted to this new card. \nSince people have a known preference for registering \u201cselect\u201d decisions before \u201cdon\u2019t-\nselect\u201d decisions (Evans et al., 1987), such forgetfulness could, again, inflate the \ninspection times for selected cards (decided about earlier) than rejected cards (decided \nabout later). Third, sensory leakage, where cards may be inspected (and even rejected) \nbefore the mouse pointer has had a chance to reach them, could also result in inflated \ntimes for selected over rejected cards. \nRoberts (1998b) systematically manipulated the presence of these task-format biases \nacross a series of experiments, and demonstrated that the magnitude of the inspection-\ntime effect was closely related to the number of sources of bias present. With all sources \nremoved the inspection-time effect was also eradicated. Moreover, in a unique \ndeselection task -- where all cards were initially presented as selected, and participants \nclicked to deselect them -- a complete reversal of the inspection-time effect was \nobserved (i.e., deselected cards were inspected for longer than those that remained \nselected). Overall, Roberts\u2019 (1998b) results suggest that biases arising form task-format \nfactors may provide at least as good an explanation of apparent inspection-time effects \nin the selection task as Evans\u2019 H-A framework (see Evans, 1998a, and Roberts, 1998a, \nfor a subsequent exchange of views on the implications of inspection-time findings for \nthe H-A account).  \nMore recently, Ball, Lucas, Miles and Gale (2003) have critiqued inspection-time \nstudies using mouse-pointing because of their use of an inherently insensitive technique \nfor monitoring the second-by-second transitions in attentional processing that arise \nduring selection-task performance. Of particular concern is the fact that mouse pointing \nis an indirect measure of attentional processing since participants have actively and \neffortfully to move the mouse pointer to cards that they are thinking about. Ball et al. \nThink-Aloud Protocols   13 \n \nadvocate the use of eye-movement tracking as a more precise approach for measuring \nmoment-by-moment attentional shifts that underlie cognitive performance with highly \ndisplay-based problems like the selection task. Ball et al. report three experiments that \nsystematically eradicated the sources of artefact discussed by Roberts (1998b) by \ncombining careful task constructions with eye-movement tracking to measure directly \non- line processing. All three experiments produced good evidence for the robustness of \nthe inspection-time effect, so supporting the predictions of the H-A account. \n A recent experiment by Roberts and Newton (2001, Experiment 1) that \nencompassed a methodological innovation to improve on previous mouse-pointing \ntechniques also demonstrated a reliable association between card selection and \nincreased inspection times, indicating that mouse pointing measures can be sensitive to \neffects predicted by the H-A framework. Roberts and Newton (2001), however, \npresented two further studies (Experiments 2 and 3) using a rapid-response selection \ntask (requiring a card decision within 2 s of its presentation) that led them to propose an \nimportant caveat concerning the adequacy of the H-A theory, although they remain \nbroadly favourable toward this account. They note that their rapid-response tasks raised \nlevels of matching for consequent cards on certain rule forms (without increasing levels \nof logical responding) in comparison with free-time tasks. This suggests that analytic \nprocessing arising in free-time situations may serve to overturn candidate cards cued \nthrough attentional heuristics (in contradiction to Evans\u2019 H-A account, but in line with \nmental models proposals). It is possible, however, that the analytic effects that influence \ncard selections identified by Roberts and Newton (2001) may be restricted to a subset of \nindividuals, with a majority responding equivalently under both speeded and unspeeded \nconditions. Thus the H-A theory may capture the behaviour of most individuals, whilst \nother accounts (e.g., mental models theory) may better describe the processing of a \nThink-Aloud Protocols   14 \n \nsubset of individuals (see Stanovich & West, 1998, for evidence of individual \ndifferences in responding on the selection task).   \nDespite the general support for key tenets of the H-A account of selection task that \nderive from Roberts and Newton (2001) and Ball et al. (2003), both sets of researchers \nnote that the magnitude of the inspection-time effect tends to be very small. Roberts and \nNewton observed that the difference between selected and non-selected cards was 0.3 s \nafter transformation, a value that maps well onto the 0.36 s difference seen by Ball et al. \nin their Experiment 3 (which arguably involved the least influence of task-format \nbiases). At first sight such data seem inconsistent with Evans\u2019 view that the inspection-\ntime effect is attributable to conscious rationalization processes that are applied to to-\nbe-selected cards with the aim of justifying heuristically-determined choices. Surely, \nanalytic processes should take rather more than a fraction of a second to be applied in \nthis way? Ball et al. (2003) note, however, that the idea that analytic rationalization \nshould take a lengthy amount of time may be more apparent than real. In support of this \nassertion they point to research by Wason and Evans (1975) that investigated the \njustifications people provide for card selections. Wason and Evans uncovered a \nphenomenon termed secondary matching bias, which is a marked tendency for people to \nrationalize a card choice in terms of a matching value that might be present on the \ncard\u2019s reverse side. Thus, for a rule such as If there is an A on one side of the card then \nthere is a 3 on the other side, participants justify why the A card should be selected by \nstating how a 3 (a matching value) on the other side would verify the rule. It is entirely \npossible that any rationalization process, whilst analytic and evaluative in intent, may, \nnevertheless, be guided by the extremely rapid, heuristic cueing of relevant information.  \nAnother possible account of the small inspection-time difference between selected \nand non-selected cards is that analytic rationalization processes do not actually occur at \nThink-Aloud Protocols   15 \n \nall on the selection task (i.e., heuristic processing dominates all task-based activity). The \ninspection-time effect would, by this account, merely reflect the action of heuristic \nprocesses holding attention on relevant cards for slightly longer than irrelevant ones. As \nBall et al. (2003) point out, however, under such an account it is unclear what kind of \nprocessing might be occurring during the extra period of heuristically-compelled \nattention to cards if analytic processing is believed not to be taking place. \nVerbal-Protocol Data and the Selection Task \nOne approach to advancing a theoretical understanding of the processing arising \nduring selection-task performance might be to obtain verbal \u201cthink-aloud\u201d protocols \nfrom participants attempting such problems. The elicitation of verbal protocols from \npeople engaging in problem solving and reasoning has become a respected method of \ncognitive enquiry since the publication of Ericsson and Simon\u2019s (e.g., 1980, 1993) \nresearch assessing the validity of this approach. In particular, Ericsson and Simon \n(1993), having reviewed a wide body of pertinent literature, stress that the production of \nconcurrent think-aloud reports can provide a highly accurate and complete index of the \ncurrent contents of short-term memory, in that whatever is consciously attended to by a \nparticipant is also verbalisable. In addition, Ericsson and Simon (1993) provide \ncompelling evidence indicating that retrospective reports elicited from people \nsubsequent to task-based performance are problematic in terms of their validity, as they \nseem to be susceptible to biases arising from self- theorising on the part of the \nparticipant (cf. Nisbett & Wilson, 1977).  \nGiven that concurrent think-aloud protocols appear to be effective for tracing the \nlocus of attention during cognitive task performance in reasoning contexts (cf. Evans, \n1989), it is perhaps surprising that there are few published reports that have employed \nthis method in studying the selection task. Indeed some of the most recent research \nThink-Aloud Protocols   16 \n \nusing verbalisation methods have actually been at odds with Ericsson and Simon\u2019s \nrecommendations for the importance of eliciting concurrent rather than retrospective \nreports. So, for example, Green and Larkin (1995) utilised a post-hoc reporting \ntechnique, whereby participants had explicitly to provide reasons for their card \nselections when prompted by the experimenter. Such focused,  retrospective \nverbalisations may well tell us very little about the on-line focus of participants\u2019 \nmoment-by-moment attentional processing as might be gleaned from the use of a \nconcurrent verbalisation method. Another recent body of selection-task research by \nStenning and van Lambalgen\u2019s (2002) elicited verbalisations from participants tackling \nselection tasks as part of a Socratic \u201ctutorial dialogue\u201d between experimenter and \nreasoner. As interesting as this methodology certainly is, we believe the technique may \nhave only a limited bearing on the issue of individual reasoning processes divorced \nfrom the dynamics of didactic conversations between students and tutors. Indeed \nStenning and van Lambalgen (2002, p. 281) themselves acknowledge that \u201cEngaging \nsubjects in dialogue undoubtedly changes their thoughts, and may even invoke learning. \nThe relation between the reasoning processes evoked by the standard way of conducting \nthe task, and the processes reflected in subsequent dialogues is a relation that remains to \nbe clarified\u201d.  \nOne key study of the selection task that has utilised more reliable concurrent-\nreporting methods is that reported by Beattie and Baron (1988, Experiments 2 and 3). \nThis research provided evidence that participants rarely mentioned alternative cards to \nthe ones that they ended up selecting -- an effect that Beattie and Baron viewed as \nsupporting the notion of a heuristically-based matching process. Participants were also \nseen to be overconfident about their card choices and showed little sensitivity to the \ncorrectness of their selections. However, Beattie and Baron\u2019s protocol coding scheme \nThink-Aloud Protocols   17 \n \nfunctioned at a fairly gross level of analysis that focused on the classification of \nselection patterns and the categorization of responses to probe questions. As such, their \ncoding does not appear to have been geared toward uncovering insights into the \nspontaneous analytic processing that might be associated with card choices. \nA more recent protocol analysis of the selection task was presented by Evans (1995, \nExperiment 5). Protocols were analysed in two distinct ways. First, they were scored for \nreferences to the facing sides of cards. The percentage references were then divided \naccording to whether the participant selected the card or not. Second, protocols were \nscored for references to the hidden sides of cards, and again these scores were broken \ndown according to whether the card was selected or not. Consistent with Beattie and \nBaron\u2019s (1988) findings, Evans\u2019 first analysis revealed a significant and substantial \ntendency for participants to refer more often to the facing sides of cards that ended up \nbeing selected than to the facing sides of cards that ended up being rejected. \nImportantly, however, Evans\u2019 secondary analysis revealed an identical tendency for \nparticipants to refer more to the hidden sides of selected cards than to the hidden sides \nof non-selected cards. Evans (1995) viewed these findings as supporting the H-A \nposition that people think only about some cards and not others, and that thinking about \nhidden sides of cards mostly serves to rationalize decis ions to choose such cards. \nExperiment 1 \nWe are generally persuaded by Evans\u2019 (1995) protocol-based support for the role of \nrelevance effects and rationalization processes in the selection task. It is noteworthy, \nhowever, that Evans\u2019 findings derive from the analysis of four distinct experimental \nconditions involving very small sample sizes (i.e., ns of 3, 3, 4, and 5). In addition, \nEvans\u2019 tasks involved arbitrarily thematic selection-task materials (as opposed to \nabstract contents), and certain experimental conditions entailed highly non-standard \nThink-Aloud Protocols   18 \n \njudgement instructions. Furthermore, Evans\u2019 statistical analysis of his dataset using chi-\nsquared tests was potentially problematic in that participants contributed multiple data \npoints to both the selected and non-selected cells of the contingency tables. Finally, \nEvans\u2019 analyses did not focus on the important issue of the content of people\u2019s \nreferences to potential values that may reside on the hidden sides of cards. Gaining an \nunderstanding of whether secondary matching bias effects (Wason & Evans, 1975) are \nassociated with hidden-side references would be especially valuable for advancing an \nunderstanding of why the attentional processing of selected cards evidenced in \ninspection-time studies (Ball et al., 2003; Roberts & Newton, 2001) seems to be \nincreased only to a small (though reliable) degree relative to non-selected cards. \nOverall, then, there would seem to be clear scope for replicating Evans\u2019 (1995) \nprotocol-based findings with an increased sample size, more conventional task features \n-- including the employment of standard abstract problems -- and traditional task \ninstructions. Such a replication formed the primary aim of our first experiment. \nCrucially, too, we set out to adapt the H-A predictions that have been applied \neffectively in inspection-time studies (e.g., Ball et al., 2003; Evans, 1996; Roberts, \n1998b) so as to enable more powerful statistical tests to be pursued of the H-A theory in \nterms of people\u2019s references to the facing and hidden sides of selected and non-selected \ncards. To this latter end we established three key predictions: \nP1 --  Cards that are associated with higher selection rates will also be associated \nwith more references to their facing sides. \nP2 -- For any given card, those participants who select it will refer more to its facing \nside than those participants who do not select it.  \nP3 -- For each participant, their mean number of references to the facing sides of \nselected cards should be higher than to the facing sides of non-selected cards. \nThink-Aloud Protocols   19 \n \nThe latter participant- level prediction is a variant of that advocated by Roberts \n(1998b) in the context of card inspection-time analyses, and is argued to be a more \npowerful test of the H-A account than either P1 or P2, which involve item-level \nanalyses. It should be noted, too, that all three predictions have been stated solely in \nterms of references to the facing sides of cards. It is also possible, however, to restate \neach of these predictions so that they apply equally to the analysis of references to the \nhidden sides of cards. Such re-stated predictions would be entirely in line with the claim \nof the H-A theory (e.g., Evans 1995, 1996) that rationalization processes serve merely \nto justify card choices, thereby promoting increased references to hidden sides of \nselected cards relative to the hidden sides of non-selected ones. \nFinally we derived one further prediction from the H-A theory that pertained to the \ncontent of people\u2019s explicit references to the hidden sides of cards. This prediction was \nas follows: \nP4 -- The total pool of references to hidden sides of cards should be dominated by \nreferences to potential matching values that might appear on the reverse sides of \ncards relative to either mismatching values or negated matching values.  \nThis last prediction derives from the assumption that secondary matching heuristics \nmay guide the analytic rationalization processes associated with to-be-selected cards \n(Wason & Evans, 1975; Ball et al., 2003). \nMethod \nParticipants. Participants were 30 undergraduate volunteers from the University of \nDerby who took part in the experiment to gain course credit. Participants had not \nreceived any tuition on the psychology of reasoning. \nMaterials and apparatus. The experiment involved selection tasks employing \nabstract conditional rules within a standard negations paradigm. Each participant \nThink-Aloud Protocols   20 \n \nreceived four versions of the task, with negatives permuted through the conditional \nstatements as shown in Table 1a (conventional terminology is used throughout the \npaper to refer to cards). Each problem was presented on a single A4 page. The rule was \npositioned at the top of the page, a reminder of the task requirement appeared in the \nmiddle of the page, and the pictures of the four cards were presented in the lower half of \nthe page in a two-by-two arrangement. The location of cards within each array was \nalways random. The experiment was carried out in an audio-recording suite to enable \nparticipants\u2019 think-aloud protocols to be recorded. \n(Table 1 about here) \nProcedure.  Participants were tested individually. They were initially told about the \nessential nature of the experiment and the basic \u201cthink-aloud\u201d requirement. To help \nclarify the expectations surrounding the think-aloud requirement and to put participants \nat their ease a brief video-based demonstration was provided of someone verbalizing \nwhilst carrying out a moderately difficult problem-solving task involving the rebuilding \nof a pyramid structure using jigsaw-like building blocks. Subsequent to this \ndemonstration the following written instructions were presented: \nThis study is concerned with people\u2019s logical reasoning ability and will entail you \nhaving to tackle a total of four problems. These problems will appear on separate \nsheets in front of you. Each problem consists of four cards and a rule that applies to \nthose cards. This rule may be true or false. The cards have been constructed so that \neach one always has a letter on one side and a single-figure number on the other \nside. Naturally only one side of each card will be visible to you.  \nFor each problem your task is to decide which card or cards need to be turned \nover in order to discover whether or not the rule is true. It is all right for you to \nThink-Aloud Protocols   21 \n \nchange your mind as you work through a problem, and I will not record any \ndecisions until you tell me what your final choice or choices are. \nWhilst you are reading through each problem and deciding how to solve it, \nplease remember that I would like you to think aloud. As I\u2019ve explained, you should \nfind it quite natural to say aloud  whatever happens to come into your head whilst \nyou are working on these tasks. If you do fall silent for any length of time, however, \nI will gently prompt you to try and keep thinking aloud. \nOnce the participant had read the instructions the experimenter re-read them aloud \nand provided an opportunity for participants to seek clarification concerning any of the \nstudy requirements. The four problems were then presented in a random order. \nResults \nCard-selection patterns. Our first concern was to assess whether our tasks elicited \nthe standard pattern of card selections observed in the literature (i.e., more matching \nthan mismatching choices across antecedent and consequent cases). Matching bias was \nexamined using the procedures adopted by Evans et al. (1987), summarized in Table 1b. \nAn alpha level of .05 was set for all tests reported throughout this paper. Wilcoxon \nsigned-rank tests (one-tailed) revealed that more antecedent matching cards were \nselected than antecedent mismatching ones, p = .01, and that more consequent matching \ncards were selected than consequent mismatching ones, p < .001. This pattern of results \nis, therefore, typical of that seen for selection tasks within the negations paradigm. \nProtocol coding, reliability assessment, and normality checks. Verbal protocols \nwere transcribed and then coded using three categorization systems. The first scheme \nwas inspired by Evans (1995, Experiment 5) and involved examining an individual\u2019s \nprotocol and, for each rule, identifying the discrete references to the facing side of each \ncard. Frequency counts for each participant\u2019s total number of references per card were \nThink-Aloud Protocols   22 \n \nthen calculated in order to provide a measure for use in subsequent statistical analyses. \nIt is important to note that in applying this first scheme we were cautious not to code \nany references to facing card sides that occurred when participants were making or \nconfirming their final card selections. This meant that we could avoid the possibility of \nobtaining artefactual support for H-A predictions arising from the fact that only selected \ncards needed to be actively registered by participants. Any references to facing sides \narising at the selection-registering phase would artificially inflate the frequency-count \nof mentions to selected cards, since it is only these cards that need to be referred to \nexplicitly (for similar methodological concerns relating to the inspection-time effect in \nselection task studies see Roberts, 1998b, and Ball et al., 2003). In essence, our \nconservative measure of references to facing sides provides a stronger test of H-A \npredictions than the coding scheme applied by Evans (1995, Experiment 5), which \nappears not to have considered such methodological artefacts.  \nOur second categorization scheme was identical to the previous one in all respects, \nexcept for its focus on a participant\u2019s references to the hidden side of each card (again, \nsee Evans, 1995, Experiment 5). Two coders (the authors of the present paper) \nindependently applied both of the aforementioned categorization schemes to the full set \nof verbal protocols. Inter-coder reliability checks revealed a very high degree of \nconsistency between coders (i.e., 97% inter-coder agreement), and there was no \nevidence of systematic divergences between coders in their categorization of discrete \nreferences to the facing or hidden sides of each logical case. The codes applied by the \nsecond author were used for all analyses associated with P1, P2 and P3. \nOur third categorization scheme involved sub-categorising each reference to a \nhidden side in terms of the specific letter or number content mentioned in that reference. \nThis coding scheme used the following four sub-categories, which are illustrated in \nThink-Aloud Protocols   23 \n \nterms of participants\u2019 potential references to what might have been on the other side of \nthe A card associated with an If A then 3 rule: (1) a reference to a matching item (e.g., \nmentioning the possibility of a 3 on the other side of the A card); (2) a reference to \nmismatching item (e.g., mentioning the possibility of a number such as a 7, on the other \nside of the A); (3) a reference to a negated matching item (e.g., stating that there could \nbe a number that is not a 3 on the reverse of the A); and (4) a non-specific reference to \nwhat might be on the other side of the card (e.g., when participants stated how \u201cIt is \nimportant to see what\u2019s on the other side of the A\u201d,  without qualifying such comments \nfurther). It should be noted that whilst other sub-categories are possible in addition to \nthe four we have described (e.g., references to negated mismatching items), our four \nsub-categories successfully captured the full range of content that we discerned in \nparticipants\u2019 references to the hidden sides of cards. This third coding scheme was \napplied by the second author. As there was only limited scope for miscategorizing \nreferences using this scheme (i.e., the new codes simply reflected a more detailed \nbreakdown of the explicit references to hidden card sides that had already been \nidentified) we did not deem it necessary to pursue inter-coder reliability checks on the \napplication of these codes. \nDescriptive analysis of our data revealed that they were positively skewed. Log \ntransformations (subsequent to the addition of suitable constants) were found to \nstabilize variances successfully. Identical problems with skew were encountered in \nExperiment 2, and statistical analyses were, therefore, performed on log-transformed \ndata throughout both experiments3. For clarity of interpretation we report means both \nbefore transformation and converted back into their original units after transformation.  \nAnalyses relating to H-A predictions. Our statistical analyses examined the four \npredictions, identified above, that derive from Evans\u2019 (e.g., 1996) H-A account. As \nThink-Aloud Protocols   24 \n \nnoted previously, P1, P2 and P3 apply equivalently to the measure of references to the \nfacing sides of cards and to the measure of references to the hidden sides of cards.  \nOur first analysis tested P1: Cards associated with higher selection rates will be \nassociated with more references to their facing (and hidden) sides. This analysis \ninvolved exploring the correlation across all 16 cards between the overall mean \nreferences to a card side and the card\u2019s associated selection frequency (refer to Table 2). \nThe correlation between the mean number of references to facing sides and card \nselection frequencies revealed a strong positive association, r = .94, N = 16, p < .001 \n(transformed data). The correlation between mean references to hidden sides and \nselection frequencies was also positive and highly reliable, r = .89, N = 16, p < .001 \n(transformed data).  \n(Table 2 about here) \nThe second analysis tested P2: For any given card, mean references to a card side \nfor individuals selecting it would be higher than for those who did not select it. Mean \nreferences to facing and to hidden sides for each card are given in Table 3. After \ntransformation, mean references to facing sides for 16 out of 16 cards were greater for \nselectors than non-selectors, p < .001, two-tailed binomial test. Likewise, after \ntransformation, mean references to hidden sides for 15 out of 16 cards (one tie) were \ngreater for selectors than non-selectors, p = .001, two-tailed binomial test4. \n(Table 3 about here) \nP3 tested whether, for each individual, the mean references to card sides were \nhigher for selected than for non-selected cards. Two mean references to facing sides \nscores and two mean references to hidden sides scores were calculated for each person \nfrom the transformed data (Table 4). A within-participants analysis of variance \nThink-Aloud Protocols   25 \n \n(ANOVA) provided strong support for P3 for facing sides, F(1,29) = 115.44, MSE = \n2.54, p <.001, as well as for hidden sides, F(1,29) = 106.43, MSE = 2.13, p < .001. \n (Table 4 about here) \nWe assessed secondary matching bias predictions pertaining to P4 by taking the \ntotal pool of references to hidden sides of cards produced by all 30 participants, and \nthen computing the distribution of references within this pool across the four sub-\ncategories of reference-type (i.e., matching items, mismatching items, negated matching \nitems, and non-specific references). This analysis revealed that the mention of matching \nvalues dominated people\u2019s verbalizations concerning what might appear on the reverse \nsides of cards (64% of references) in relation to the mention of negated matching values \n(35% of references), mismatching values (< 1% of references) and unspecified values \n(< 1% of references).  \nDiscussion \nThe results of Experiment 1 support predictions that can be derived from Evans\u2019 \n(e.g., 1996) H-A account of the selection task. Overall, the analyses demonstrate that \nselected cards are associated with more attention than non-selected cards, as indexed by \nthe quantity of explicit references to both their facing sides and their hidden sides. The \nfinding that H-A predictions are substantiated in the analysis of references to the hidden \nsides appears to lend support to Evans\u2019 claimed role for analytic rationalization \nprocesses during selection-task performance. Thus, whilst to-be-selected cards elicit \nincreased consideration of what values might be on their reverse sides, such \nconsideration seems to do little to change the fact that these cards tend to end up being \nselected (otherwise the link between references to hidden sides and card selection \nwould be broken). One way to interpret our findings, then, is that thinking about the \nhidden sides of cards appears to have a minimal functional role in determining card \nThink-Aloud Protocols   26 \n \nchoices (at least for a substantial number of participants), instead mainly serving to \nconfirm decisions to go ahead and choose such cards (cf. Evans, 1995, p. 168).  \nThe issue of what people are actually thinking about when they consider the reverse \nsides of cards has also been addressed in the present study, with some clear-cut \nfindings. First, participants do not think about potential mismatching values that may \nappear on the reverse sides of cards. This may be taken as further support for the H-A \nview that people tend not to see mismatching values as having any relevance to their \ndecision making during the evaluation of conditional statements. Second, the finding \nthat people\u2019s consideration of hidden values is dominated by matching possibilities \nseems to be in line with Wason and Evans\u2019 (1975) notion that secondary matching \nheuristics may cue people\u2019s analytic accounts as to why values on the hidden sides of \ncards justify selection of those cards. This evidence for secondary matching effects in \nabstract selection tasks also helps make sense of card inspection-time findings (e.g., \nBall et al., 2003) that suggest analytic rationalization processes are rapid in nature. \nRationalization might well be expected to be extremely fast if people\u2019s justifications are \nfacilitated by the heuristic cueing of \u201crelevant\u201d (i.e., matching) values that could appear \non the reverse sides of cards.  \nAlthough we believe the findings from Experiment 1 are congruent with Evans\u2019 H-\nA account of the selection task, it is possible that other contemporary theories such as \nthe ODS and mental models accounts could also accommodate these results. We return \nto this pertinent issue after first presenting our Experiment 2 data.  \nExperiment 2 \nExperiment 1 produced findings that are both in line with predictions of the H-A \ntheory of the selection task, and that also converge with evidence previously obtained \nfrom mouse-tracking and eye-tracking studies of card inspection times (e.g., Evans, \nThink-Aloud Protocols   27 \n \n1996; Ball et al., 2003) and from small-scale protocol studies reported by Evans (1995). \nIn addition, Experiment 1 has clarified the important role played by secondary matching \nprocesses when people are referring to the hidden sides of to-be-selected cards. One \nissue that remains open to further examination, however, is the effect that enforced \nattention to cards might have on people\u2019s heuristic and analytic processing, as measured \nby both the frequency of references to facing and hidden sides of selected and non-\nselected cards, and the content of references to hidden sides. A number of researchers \nhave looked at the effects of enforced attention to all four cards in abstract selection \ntasks, including Ball et al. (2003, Experiment 3), Evans et al. (1987), and Roberts \n(1998b, Experiment 3). These studies required participants to provide \u201cselect-don\u2019t \nselect\u201d responses for all cards, and, in every case, it was found that matching-based \nresponses continued to dominate selections despite the fact that normally unattended \ncards had to be responded to. Importantly, too, Ball et al. (2003) demonstrated that the \ninspection-time effect (whereby selected cards are looked at for longer than rejected \ncards) was not totally undermined by this \u201cselect-don\u2019t select\u201d decision requirement, \nalthough the effect was reduced in magnitude, presumably because rejected cards now \nbecome associated with at least some (enforced) consideration.   \nA critical question that arises from the enforced-decision paradigm, however, is \nwhat, exactly, do people think about when they are compelled to inspect cards that they \nwould not ordinarily attend to? In particular, do people who are making card selections \nwithin this paradigm think beyond the facing sides of those cards that they choose to \nreject? The H-A theory would surely still argue that people should not think about what \nmight appear on the hidden sides of to-be-rejected cards. Although the enforced \ndecision requirement means that people must attend to such cards in order to register \nactive \u201cdon\u2019t select\u201d responses to them, the fact that these cards should rapidly be \nThink-Aloud Protocols   28 \n \ndeemed to be irrelevant means that analytic rationalization processes would not be \ncalled upon (cf. Evans 1998a). In other words, rationalization processes in the selection \ntask (and perhaps more generally too) are assumed to be \u201casymmetrical\u201d, in that people \nonly pursue analytic justifications for cards that they wish to select (as cued by \nrelevance), but not for cards which they wish to reject (on the basis of perceived \nirrelevance). Such avoidance of any further processing of information deemed as \n\u201cirrelevant\u201d certainly makes sense on the grounds of efficient information processing \n(see Evans, 1983, for further discussion of the selective nature of reasoning).  \nIn spite of the psychological plausibility of the arguments concerning selective \ninformation processing that derive from the H-A theory, it remains the case that the \ntheory\u2019s specific predictions pertaining to the enforced decision paradigm need to be \nassessed empirically. Experiment 2 was undertaken to test such predictions using the \nsame selection tasks and think-aloud instructions employed in Experiment 1, except for \nthe presence of enforced \u201cselect-don\u2019t select\u201d requirements for all cards. To test the H-\nA theory we employed the equivalent predictions for both facing and hidden card sides \nas we had used in Experiment 1. Although we expected some possible weakening of \neffect sizes for the facing side predictions (P1, P2, and P3) owing to the enforced \ndecision procedure, our previous inspection-time data (Ball et al., 2003, Experiment 3) \ngave us grounds for assuming that the basic finding of increased attention to selected \ncards over rejected ones should remain intact (i.e., people would give to-be-rejected \ncards only a minimal amount of explicit consideration, dwelling instead on to-be-\nselected cards). As far as our predictions for the hidden sides of cards were concerned, \nwe predicted effects of broadly similar magnitude to those that arose in P1 to P4 of \nExperiment 1 (i.e., participants were not expected to think about the reverse sides of to-\nbe-rejected cards any more than in the standard selection-task paradigm).   \nThink-Aloud Protocols   29 \n \nMethod \nParticipants. Participants were 30 undergraduate volunteers from the University of \nDerby, who obtained course credit for their involvement in the study. No participants \nhad received prior tuition concerning the psychology of reasoning. \nMaterials and apparatus. The selection-task materials and apparatus were identical \nto those used in Experiment 1, with the minor addition of small \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d decision \nboxes that appeared approximately 1 cm below each card. \nProcedure. The procedure was identical to Experiment 1, with the exception that  \ninstructions were modified to include reference to the presence of  \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d \nresponse boxes below cards. The second paragraph of the instructions was, therefore, \namended to read as follows: \nFor each problem your task is to decide which card or cards need to be turned over \nin order to discover whether or not the rule is true. You will need to make a \u201cturn-\ndon\u2019t turn\u201d decision about all the cards presented to you. The \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d boxes \nunderneath each card are present to remind you that you must make a \u201cturn-don\u2019t \nturn\u201d decision for every card. It is all right for you to change your mind as you work \nthrough a problem, and I will not record any decisions until you tell me what your \nfinal answers are for each card. \nAs in Experiment 1, once the participant had read the instructions the experimenter \nthen read them aloud once more to enable any clarification to be sought concerning the \ntask requirements. The four problems were presented in a random order. \nResults \nCard-selection patterns. Wilcoxon signed-ranks tests (one-tailed) revealed that more \nantecedent matching cards were selected than antecedent mismatching ones, p < .001, \nand that more consequent matching cards were selected than consequent mismatching \nThink-Aloud Protocols   30 \n \nones, p < .001. The standard matching-bias pattern is, therefore, strongly evident in the \ncard-selection responses associated with this enforced decision paradigm. \nProtocol coding, reliability assessment, and normality checks. Transcribed protocols \nwere coded using identical categorization and scoring schemes as had been applied in \nExperiment 1. Inter-coder reliability checks revealed a high level of consistency \nbetween coders in their application of the categorization schemes pertaining to \nreferences to facing and to hidden sides of cards (i.e., 95% inter-coder agreement). The \ncodes applied by the second author were used for all subsequent analyses associated \nwith the experimental predictions (P1 to P4). Similar data transformations to those used \nin Experiment 1 were employed to overcome positive skew and stabilize variances. \nAnalyses relating to H-A predictions. The mean number of references to the facing \nand the hidden sides of each card, and each card\u2019s overall selection frequency, are \npresented in Table 5. The correlations for P1 between mean references to card sides and \nselection frequencies were significant for facing sides, r = .88, N = 16, p < .001 \n(transformed data), and for hidden sides, r = .94, N = 16, p < .001 (transformed data).  \n(Table 5 about here) \nIn relation to P2, mean references to the facing and to the hidden sides of each card \nfor selectors and for non-selectors are given in Table 6. For transformed data, the \ndifference between mean references to facing sides for selectors and non-selectors was \nin the expected direction for 13 of the 16 cards (two ties), which was significant with a \nbinomial test, p = .021, two-tailed. The difference between mean references to hidden \nsides for selectors and non-selectors was in the expected direction for 15 out of 16 \ncases, which was highly reliable with a binomial test, p = .001, two-tailed. \n(Table 6 about here) \nThink-Aloud Protocols   31 \n \nTo assess P3 we again undertook more powerful participant- level analyses using \nANOVA, which revealed (see Table 7) a significant difference in the mean references \nto facing sides for participants\u2019 selected versus non-selected cards, F(1,29) = 4.62, MSE \n= .04, p = .04, and a significant difference in the mean references to hidden sides for \nparticipants\u2019 selected versus non-selected cards, F(1,29) = 8.94, MSE = .40, p = .006.  \n(Table 7 about here) \nFinally, we assessed secondary matching bias predictions associated with P4 by \ncalculating the distribution of all participants\u2019 references to hidden sides across the four \nsub-categories of reference-type: matching items, mismatching items, negated matching \nitems, and non-specific references. The mention of matching values dominated \nparticipants\u2019 comments about what might appear on the reverse sides of cards (62% of \nreferences) in relation to the mention of negated matching values (33% of references), \nmismatching values and unspecified values (< 3% of references in each case). This \ndistribution of references to hidden sides across these four categories is strikingly \nsimilar to the distribution observed in Experiment 1. \nDiscussion \nThe results of Experiment 2 were, again, in line with all the predictions of the H-A \naccount of performance on abstract versions of the selection task. As in Experiment 1, \npeople referred more to the facing and hidden sides of those cards that ended up being \nselected relative to those cards that ended up being rejected. This evidence for the H-A \ntheory arises in spite of the fact that the enforced decision paradigm necessarily requires \npeople to give at least some attention to cards that they might ordinarily simply ignore \non the basis of their perceived irrelevance to the task at hand. \nPrior to undertaking Experiment 2 we had also speculated about possible shifts in \nthe effect sizes for the facing and hidden side predictions (P1 to P3). More specifically, \nThink-Aloud Protocols   32 \n \nwe anticipated that the employment of enforced decision instructions might have some \nweakening influence on the magnitude of the effect size for the facing side predictions, \nsince participants had to give some attention to all cards. On the other hand we had \nassumed that there should be no real changes in the magnitude of the effect size for the \nhidden side predictions, since participants were not expected to go on to think any more \nabout the reverse sides of to-be-rejected cards even if forced to consider their facing \nsides. As it turned out, we were essentially correct in our expectations about changes to \nthe effects we had observed in Experiment 1. So for example, in relation to the P2 item-\nbased analysis, whereas 16 out of 16 cards in Experiment 1 showed increased \nreferences to facing sides for selectors compared to non-selectors, this dropped slightly \nto 13 out of 16 cards in Experiment 2. In contrast, there was no such drop between \nExperiments 1 and 2 in terms of references to hidden sides for selectors compared to \nnon-selectors across cards (i.e., 15 out of 15 cards showed expected differences in both \nexperiments). \nA broadly similar pattern of changes to effect magnitudes was seen across \nExperiments 1 and 2 in relation to the P3 participant-based analyses. From Tables 4 and \n7 it can be seen that the mean difference in references to facing sides for selected versus \nnon-selected cards dropped quite markedly from 1.02 references in Experiment 1 (i.e. \n1.26 minus 0.24) to 0.20 references in Experiment 2 (i.e., 1.08 minus 0.88), whereas the \nmean difference in references to hidden sides for selected versus non-selected cards \ndropped less strikingly from 0.66 references (i.e., 0.73 minus 0.07) in Experiment 1 to \n0.17 references (i.e., 0.34 minus 0.17) in Experiment 2. \nGeneral Discussion \nExperiments 1 and 2 were motivated by Evans\u2019 (e.g., 1996) H-A account of \nmatching-bias effects with abstract selection tasks. This account claims that \nThink-Aloud Protocols   33 \n \npreconscious, heuristic processes direct attention towards cards that appear to be \nrelevant (which end up being selected) and away from ones that appear to be irrelevant \n(which are then rejected). Moreover, any conscious analytic processing that is applied \nto cards is assumed to have little functional role in determining selections, serving \ninstead to rationalize decis ions that have already been made on the basis of relevance \njudgements. In our experiments we elicited concurrent verbal protocols from \nindividuals tackling selection tasks in order to examine H-A predictions concerning \nwhat people think about when deliberating over cards. The think-aloud method is a \nvaluable way to study sequential thinking activity as it is typically viewed as having the \ncapacity to provide a reliable index of the locus of participants\u2019 attentional focus during \ntask performance (Ericsson & Simon, 1993; Evans, 1989). Although the think-aloud \nmethod may be less sensitive than other methods (e.g., eye-movement tracking) for \nmonitoring the second-by-second shifts that arise in the focus of attention, a key \nadvantage of the approach is that it provides an explicit trace of the content of people\u2019s \nthoughts about those task components that have captured attention. \nExperiment 1 used a standard selection-task paradigm where active, select decisions \nwere required only for cards that participants thought should be turned over to test the \ngiven rules. The protocol-based evidence obtained in Experiment 1 was directly in line \nwith predictions derivable from the H-A theory. Participants referred reliably more \noften to the facing and the hidden sides of those cards that they selected compared with \nthose that they rejected. These results substantiate Evans\u2019 (1995) findings from a set of \nsmall-scale protocol studies involving low participant numbers and a variety of non-\nstandard instructional and contextual factors. In addition, Experiment 1 revealed new \nevidence for the role of secondary matching biases (Wason & Evans, 1975) dominating \npeople\u2019s references to the hidden sides of cards. This latter finding suggests that \nThink-Aloud Protocols   34 \n \npeople\u2019s analytic processes may be supported by the rapid, secondary cueing of \nmatching information. This result also clarifies why the card inspection-time data of \nBall et al. (2000; see also Roberts & Newton, 2001) indicate that even selected cards are \nassociated with quite minimal processing effort. That is, if analytic rationalization \nprocesses are supported by the rapid, heuristic cueing of \u201crelevant\u201d values that might \narise on the reverse sides of cards, then there is no reason to expect such rationalizations \nto take more than the briefest amount of time.  \nExperiment 2 employed an enforced choice selection-task paradigm to assess what \nimpact placing a \u201cselect-don\u2019t select\u201d decision requirement on all cards might have on \nthe content of people\u2019s thinking. We know from previous research (e.g., Ball et al., \n2003, Experiment 3) that matching-bias and card- inspection-time effects remain intact \ndespite such enforced decision requirements. However, the fact that Ball et al. observed \na reduction in the magnitude of the predicted inspection-time effect suggests that \ncompelling people to attend to all cards might also have a small but detectable impact \non the effect magnitudes for H-A predictions pertaining to references to facing sides of \ncards. This was indeed seen to be the case. All facing side predictions were supported, \nbut there was some evidence of reduction in the size of the observed effects. Perhaps \nmore importantly, however, in the case of H-A predictions pertaining to references to \nhidden sides of cards, we expected reliable effects (as in Experiment 1), but with no \nparticularly marked impact on effect magnitudes. This was because the H-A theory \nwould argue that people should not think about what values might be on the hidden \nsides of to-be-rejected cards (since these are judged to be irrelevant), even if the task \ninstructions necessitate that people have to attend momentarily to the facing sides of \nsuch cards. Again, all H-A expectations gained support from the protocol-based data \nobtained in Experiment 2, with reliable analytic-processing effects in evidence for \nThink-Aloud Protocols   35 \n \nselected cards versus rejected cards, and less noticeable reductions in effect magnitudes \nfor the hidden side predictions compared with the facing side predictions. \nOverall, then, we believe that we have uncovered protocol-based evidence for the \nrole of relevance effects influencing both heuristic and analytic processing in abstract \nselection task performance, as predicted by Evans\u2019 H-A theory. It is important, \nhowever, to consider whether other contemporary theories of the selection task are able \nto accommodate the present set of findings. Indeed, we acknowledge that our study did \nnot encompass a crucial experiment that was set up to arbitrate unequivocally between \ndifferent theoretical perspectives on the selection task. Thus it may well be that whilst \nour findings are congruent with the H-A theory that motivated our research, they may \nbe similarly amenable to interpretation by one or more other contemporary selection \ntask theories. \n As we noted previously, Oaksford and Chater\u2019s (e.g., 1994, 1996) ODS account has \na compelling track record in terms of its capacity to explain many aspects of selection-\ntask performance (including the influence of probabilistic manipulations) across a \nvariety of task variants. According to the ODS theory, information gain provides a \nformal measure of \u201crelevance\u201d (see Oaksford & Chater, 1995), and therefore ODS \npredicts the same basic pattern of matching-card selections as envisaged by the H-A \ntheory. Moreover, ODS theory seems readily able to provide an alternative H-A account \nof our protocol-based findings that is distinct from Evans\u2019 emphasis on the linguistic \nbasis of matching effects (we are grateful to Oaksford, personal communication, for \nalerting us to this). So, for example, relevance assessments determined on-line by \nparticipants via information-gain calculations could lead to more references to matching \nversus mismatching values on facing sides. More crucially, however, ODS theory \nwould also predict that in justifying their card selections participants would show \nThink-Aloud Protocols   36 \n \nsecondary matching because for all rules they are searching for the rare case (which is \nalways the matching antecedent and matching consequent combination).  \nOverall, then, the ODS model is able to capture the relevance effects that we have \ndemonstrated in relation to references to both facing and hidden card sides, and, \nmoreover, describes secondary matching as an analytic response (Oaksford, personal \ncommunication). This account also ties in selection task behaviour to rational \nexplanations of biases in judgements relating to 2 by 2 contingency tables (e.g., \nAnderson & Sheu, 1995; Over & Green, 2001). One potential weakness with the ODS \naccount as it is currently formulated is that it does not provide a full-blown algorithmic \nlevel theory specifying the specific nature, organization and time-course of the \nprocessing steps underpinning card selections (i.e., it is formulated at the computational \nlevel of what is being computed). As Oaksford (personal communication) has pointed \nout, however, most current models of the selection task (and not just the ODS theory) \nare actually highly underspecified in terms of the detailed operation sequences \nunderlying reasoning, with theories tending merely to invoke a binary processing \ndistinction (e.g., heuristic then analytic; initial representation then fleshing out). Indeed, \nthe ODS model seems to be at least as capable as other theories of  affording an \nunderstanding of algorithmic level issues in the abstract selection task -- as has been \noutlined above. Nonetheless, it would be appealing to see the ODS theory developed \nfurther at an algorithmic level; we understand that such developments are currently \nunderway (e.g., Oaksford, 2002b), and look forward to their fruition. \nThe mental models account of the selection task (e.g., Johnson-Laird, 1995) may \nalso be able to lend itself to an explanation of some of the key findings arising in the \npresent experiments. One way to formalize an analysis of mental models predictions \nconcerning people\u2019s explicit references to card sides is to compare the mean number of \nThink-Aloud Protocols   37 \n \nreferences that people make to the sides of those cards that should be explicitly \nrepresented in models with the mean number of references to the sides of those cards \nthat should not be explicitly represent in models. The key prediction (P5) would be that \ncards represented in mental models should be associated with more references to their \nfacing and their hidden sides than cards not represented in models (see Ball et al., 2003, \nfor equivalent analyses in relation to card- inspection time data).   \nWe tested P5 for Experiment 1 by deriving participant-based scores for mean \nreferences to facing sides and mean references to hidden sides (see Table 8a). Repeated \nmeasures ANOVAs revealed good support for P5 for references to facing sides, F(1,29) \n= 44.20, MSE = 0.56, p < .001, and references to hidden sides: F(1,29) = 35.72, MSE = \n0.53, p < .001, although it is noticeable that the effect magnitudes for P5 are less than \nthose deriving from the equivalent by-participants analysis (P3) that investigated the H-\nA theory. We also conducted the P5 analysis for our Experiment 2 dataset (see Table \n8b). Again, repeated measures ANOVAs revealed good support for P5 for references to \nfacing sides of cards, F(1,29) = 15.88, MSE = 0.21, p < .001 and for hidden sides of \ncards, F(1,29) = 35.03, MSE = 0.90, p < .001. Unlike Experiment 1, the effect \nmagnitudes associated with the test of the mental models predictions (P5) now appeared \nto be larger than those for the H-A predictions (P3). \n(Table 8 about here) \nAlthough it appears that the mental models theory can provide a coherent account of \nmuch of our protocol-based data, there remains a crucial set of evidence deriving from \nExperiments 1 and 2 that appears to arbitrate in favour of a H-A or ODS interpretation \nof performance on the selection task. This evidence concerns the finding that people\u2019s \nreferences to the hidden sides of cards are dominated by the mention of matching values \nover other possible entities. This apparent asymmetry in what va lues people consider as \nThink-Aloud Protocols   38 \n \nbeing present on the reverse sides of cards does not readily seem to emerge from the \nmental models assumption that people assess cards in terms of how their hidden values \nmight impact on the truth or falsity of the presented rule. It may well be that mental \nmodels theorists could develop a viable account for such secondary matching effects, \nbut it remains the case that these effects were directly predicted by the H-A theory.  \nOur secondary matching evidence also challenge Feeney and Handley\u2019s (e.g., 2000) \nclaims to have detected a deductive component in abstract variants of the selection task \n-- a conclusion they base solely on their finding that participants consider the hidden \nsides of presented cards. However, if when considering such hidden values most people \nare simply engaging in a secondary matching process, then this would seem to be \nevidence against deduction being a key component of reasoning in the selection task5. \nThe limited support for mental models predictions deriving from evidence for \nsecondary-matching effects also calls into question Evans\u2019 past proposals (e.g., Evans \n& Over, 1996, p. 136) that mental modelling may supply the analytic component to the \nH-A theory, which has always been less well specified than the heur istic component in \nthis account. On balance, it would seem that either Evans\u2019 H-A account (minus a \nmental-models analytic stage) or Oaksford and Chater\u2019s ODS theory are most readily \nable to explain the full breadth of protocol-based evidence that we have uncovered for \nrelevance effects and rationalization processes in the selection task. ODS theory may \nwell have the edge on the H-A account, however, because of its impressive ability to \nexplain a wide range of probabilistic influences on card-selection patterns.  \nThink-Aloud Protocols   39 \n \nReferences \nAnderson, J.R., & Sheu, C.-F.

More evidence is clearly \nneeded to resolve this controversy and to determine whether or not the H-A theory\u2019s \nclaims regarding the origin of marching need to be qualified. \n2 Oaksford and Chater\u2019s (e.g., 1994, 1995) analysis also entails a rarity assumption, \nwhich is that most properties of the world (including the properties described by p and q \nin selection task studies) apply to a small set of objects, and that people\u2019s strategies for \ntesting or framing hypotheses are, by default, adapted to situations where rarity holds \n(for supporting evidence see Anderson & Sheu, 1995; McKenzie, Ferreira, Mikkelsen, \nMcDermott, & Skrable, 2001; McKenzie & Mikkelsen, 2000). \n3 In Experiment 1 a constant of 0.4 was used for both the facing-side and the \nhidden-side data transformations. In Experiment 2 a constant of 0.6 was used for the \nfacing-side transformation, and one of 0.2 was used for the hidden-side transformation. \n4 One interesting observation in relation to the Experiment 1 results presented in \nTable 3 (and indeed the Experiment 2 results in Table 6) is that it seems as if more \nreferences are made to the facing and hidden sides of selected cards than rejected ones   \nwhen such cards should, in fact, be rejected according to the H-A model. We note, \nhowever, that Evans (e.g., 1996, 1998a) has clarified that \u201crelevance\u201d effects can extend \nbeyond cards that are cued by the matching and the if heuristics. For example, a key \nclaim of Evans (1996) is that even when selection patterns are seen to vary considerably \nacross different thematic contents, selections can still be interpreted as arising from \nrelevance judgements. In addition, we note that it is possible that a subset of individuals \nThink-Aloud Protocols   45 \n \nin our experiments were pursing full-blown and effortful logical analyses of cards (cf. \nStanovich & West, 1998). The presence of such individuals in \u201cselected\u201d cells \ncorresponding to infrequently selected cards could provide an alternative account of \nwhy more references are made to the facing and hidden sides of such cards by a \nminority of selectors relative to a majority of rejectors. \n5 We are grateful to Mike Oaksford for pointing out to us this discrepancy between \nour protocol-based findings and the evidence forwarded by Feeney and Handley (2000). \n \n \n \nThink-Aloud Protocols   46 \n \nTable 1 \n(a) The Four Types of Conditional Rule Employed in Experiments 1 and 2, Including the \nStandard Terminology that is Used to Describe Associated Cards, and (b) the Method \nUsed for Assessing Matching Bias on Antecedent and Consequent Cases in Experiments \n1 and 2 \n(a) Logical Case \n     Rule TA FA TC FC \n1.
