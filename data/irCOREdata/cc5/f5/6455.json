It reports on an investigation of the issues surrounding the adaptation of this\nHE-orientated resource to an FE context. This involved piloting FOCUS with FE staff\nto assess its suitability. The issues raised by this process are discussed and general\nimplications for the adaptation of generic HE resources to the FE sector are identified.\nIntroduction\nThe Dearing Report of 1997 has raised the profile of the use of information and\ncommunications technology (ICT) in learning and teaching. This in turn has led to a\ndemand for staff development on the successful incorporation of ICT in education (Smith\nand Oliver, 2000). In HE, there have been a number of targeted funding initiatives such as\nthe Computers in Teaching Initiative (CTI) and the current third phase of the Teaching\nand Learning Technology Programme. This latter programme focuses on embedding\nlearning technologies rather than developing software products, leading to generic projects\non the implementation of ICT in education. As these projects aim for cross-institutional\ntransferability, there seems no reason why - although carried out in the context of HE -\nthey should not be widened to address the needs of the FE sector.\nThis article will look at the expected expansion in FE (Blunkett, 2000) and aims to show\nhow ICT (often referred to as Information and Learning Technology (ILT) in further\neducation), allied to strategic goals, represents one potential solution to the challenges FE\nfaces. It will then describe the TLTP3 FOCUS project and the efforts being made to\nbroaden its appeal to the FE community. Feedback from a focus group is included to\nillustrate users' needs, and general issues in resource adaptation are identified.\n75\nJanice Smith \u2022 FOCUS on technology-supported learning in further education\nFE and lifelong learning\nFurther education in the UK has historically been underfunded (FEDA, 2000; Select\nCommittee on Education, 1998) in comparison with other spheres of tertiary education, in\nspite of addressing a far broader curriculum offer (Kennedy, 1997). In addition, FE is now\nat the centre of government initiatives in lifelong learning and needs to find new ways of\ndelivering an ever-broadening range of qualifications (HEFCE, 2000a) to students with an\never-widening range of abilities (Kennedy, 1997). Substantial funds are now available to the\nFE community to improve ICT infrastructure and invest in new technology, which is viewed\nas one important way of supporting learning. All colleges are required to produce an\nInformation and Learning Technology (ILT) strategy document under the National\nLearning Network (NLN) initiative, and appoint staff as 'ILT Learning Champions'. A\nnational training programme is under way to enable the new ILT Learning Champions to\nlead the way within their own college in promoting ILT for curriculum delivery. See the FE\nResources for Learning Website http:llferl.becta.org.uk for more information including the\nFEFC report Networking Lifelong Learning and FEFC Circulars 99\/45 and 99\/53. This\nsuggests that wider use of ICT will become increasingly important with the closer\ncollaboration of further and higher education institutions (HEFCE, 2000a) and that a\ngreater proportion of higher education is likely to be delivered in FE colleges (Boreham and\nMorgan, 1999) with the introduction of two-year foundation degrees (HEFCE, 2000b).\nWe expect foundation degrees to appeal to a wide range of students. Given the\nvocational focus of these degrees, we anticipate that a high proportion of applicants will\nbe employees seeking to open up new career horizons by enhancing their education and\nskills. These individuals are likely to want flexible modes of delivery such as part-time or\ndistance learning provision that enables them to both 'earn and learn'. (HEFCE, 2000b)\nNot only will the likely participants in foundation degrees be non-traditional, that is, part-\ntime and distance learners, but delivery is increasingly likely to be undertaken by\nnon-traditional teaching staff, accentuating an existing trend: by 1999, 63 per cent of FE\nlecturers were employed on a part-time basis (Tester, 2000), with a sector high of 92 per\ncent part-time lecturers in one FE college (Betts, 2000). If suitable levels of tutorial and\npersonal support are going to be available to these new learners, many of whom will have\nbeen out of the education system for some time, the supportive features of ICT need to be\nbetter understood and well-deployed to ensure retention and achievement.\nThe proportion of part-time teachers in FE poses a challenge: how does the college\nschedule training programmes, either for the suggested mandatory teaching qualification\nor for improving ICT skills to the point where these lecturers can make use of the new\ntechnologies to support their new learners?\nICT and learning\nFor a long time, the use of ICT in FE has been measured by the ratio of computers to\nstudents, or investment in open access study areas that feature prominently in college\nmarketing materials and prospectuses. However, 'mere provision of information tech-\nnology does not in itself guarantee change; integration and management are necessary if\nparticular education or organization outcomes are desired' (Tearle, Dillon and Davis,\n1999).\n76\nALT-J Volume 8 Number 3\nThis point is important: simply introducing computers and expecting students to use them\nfor coursework fails to take advantage of the benefits of the technology. It is widely\nacknowledged that well-planned integration of ICT (Draper, 1997; Laurillard, 1997) can\nprovide flexible, supportive environments (Rowntree, 1992; Ehrmann, 1996; Race, 1994) to\nmotivate students to extend their skills and knowledge. In addition, the potential of ICT\nuse has been recognized to be of particular use to assist 'non-traditional' learners such as\npart-timers and distance learners through the use of synchronous and asynchronous tools\nto create support networks amongst such learners (Conole and Oliver, 1998; Mayadas,\n1997).\nContinued expansion and attraction of lifelong learners means these tools must now be\nbetter deployed within the curriculum: a recent survey sponsored by FEDA\n(http:\/\/www.citadel.acukf) has demonstrated an investment in self-study materials within\nFE, but little incidence of virtual learning environments (VLEs). These tools can offer\nmany kinds of support to the learner that will be important to cope with the expansion in\nFE provision noted above, including:\n\u2022 asynchronous communication, where learners can log on and follow a 'threaded'\ndebate at a time convenient to themselves;\n\u2022 learner tracking systems, where lecturers can analyse their students' access to and\nprogress through provided materials;\n\u2022 secure content, available in a structured way to support the learner;\n\u2022 Web links to quality-assured, freely available material;\n\u2022 file-sharing to encourage collaborative work;\n\u2022 online assessment, to reduce the marking burden on lecturers and provide instant\nfeedback to learners.\nTo make best use of such facilities, however, strategic endorsement must support\nimplementation and sufficient resources be provided for staff development. The\ndevelopment of ILT strategies in further education and learning and teaching strategies in\nhigher education focus the need for appropriate, high-quality resources to prepare and\nsupport lecturing staff in implementing technology-supported learning. As Bailey (1996)\nidentified, 'difficulty in identifying relevant materials' was a concern for those in HE, which\nled him to identify four training needs:\n\u2022 Awareness of how learning technologies could be used in teaching, learning and\nassessment.\n\u2022 Knowledge and skills in the use of learning technologies in teaching, learning and\nassessment.\n\u2022 Locating existing materials and assessing whether they would fit within your teaching.\n\u2022 Developing skills in designing and producing computer-based learning materials.\nHis findings were confirmed by the TALiSMAN project, in that 'three-quarters of all staff,\nparticularly in smaller institutions, do not feel that they know how to locate relevant\nnetwork-based learning technology' (Tomes and Higgison, 1998).\n77\nJanice Smith FOCUS on technology-supported teaming in further education\nThese concerns can apply equally to FE teaching staff (Carvalho, 1999; Smith, 1999). As\nmuch energy can be expended on similar initiatives in different institutions, it would make\nsense to customize generic resources produced by the HE community in response to the\neducational development needs identified above, in order to make them accessible and\nappropriate to FE. This is especially true now, with colleges developing their ILT strategies\nand the increasing number of VLEs available. The process of extending the potential\naudience is a stated aim of the FOCUS project, to assist the FE community in their\nimplementation decisions.\nWhat is FOCUS?\nFOCUS is a TLTP3-funded project comprising the Universities of Portsmouth, Glasgow,\nLoughborough, North London and Southampton and Sheffield College. It has three main\naims:\n\u2022 to develop a Web-based database of learning and teaching techniques, tool reviews and\ncase studies of interest to those wishing to use ICT in their teaching;\n\u2022 to develop a set of staff development materials for those such as staff developers who\nsupport lecturers wishing to make use of ICT in their teaching;\n\u2022 to disseminate these products to the widest possible HE and FE audience.\nThe FOCUS Web-based database is envisaged as a 'one-stop shop' for academics and\neducational technologists in further and higher education covering pedagogy, virtual learning\nenvironments and case studies of embedding C&IT into learning and teaching. Its underlying\nframework is to provide differing levels of support dependent on the user's background and\nexisting expertise (Oliver, Phelps and Conole, 1999). FOCUS aims to help users explore\navailable resources, discover good practice and choose suitable technologies (Warren, 2000).\nFOCUS: learning and teaching using the Web\nWelcome! The aim of FOCUS is to help you explore tine ways in\nwhich the Web can be used to facilitate learning and teaching.\nFOCUS is a database of information on:\n\u2022 conventional and online educational methods;\n\u2022 Web-based educational tools and systems;\n\u2022 case studies of Web-based learning and teaching.\nItems in these three areas are cross-linked so that related items can\nbe quickly found, and a facility is provided to save useful items to an\nalbum for convenient use offline.\nIf this is the first time you have used FOCUS, click on the\nbutton on the side bar to see a step-by-step guides that show you how\nto make best use of the resources and features.\nFigure I: The FOCUS homepage.\n78\nALT-J Volume 8 Number 3\nWith increasing pressure on resources, the FOCUS database is intended as a useful vehicle\nto achieve learning and teaching innovation, to lessen the time it would take for practising\nacademics to redevelop their courses using the new technologies. A set of staff\ndevelopment materials, downloadable from the project's Website, is also available in order\nthat academics, staff developers and educational technologists can access and use the\ndatabase independently.\nFOCUS features\nTo ensure that the complexity of a Web-based database is invisible to novice users, the\nFOCUS database functionality is presented as a set of easy-to-use features, accessed via\nclickable buttons, described below.\nLocking\nThis feature enables users to locate information of interest by using a limited search\nfacility. Through the use of keywords, each category (learning, tools and examples) can be\n'locked' to facilitate searching so that, for instance, only tools that support intended\nteaching activities are displayed.\nCopy-It!\nIntegrating ICT into learning and teaching activities is a complex activity. The information\ncontained within FOCUS reflects this and can often be lengthy. To avoid users having to\nscroll through reams of text the Copy-It! function was included. When a user finds an\narticle of interest, a simple click copies it to a personalized album.\nAlbum\nAn album is a collection of articles of interest that is emailed to the user, to avoid the need\nto absorb too much information in one visit. The album can be viewed and the contents\nprinted or deleted before being emailed to keep for future reference.\nContribute\nFOCUS relies on participation. There are examples of good practice in a variety of\nsubjects and contexts that are valuable to others investigating ICT, and new tools appear\nregularly. Interested parties can provide information via the Contribute button to share\nwhat has been learned - what has worked well and maybe even what has not - with the\nwider community. Contributions to content are actively encouraged and acknowledged, as\nthe database will only remain relevant if new material is contributed by developers and\npractitioners on an ongoing basis. Copyright remains with the author. All content supplied\nto FOCUS is moderated by project team members.\nDiscussion forum\nThose with an interest in online teaching and learning can join the FOCUS mailbase list at\ntltp-focus@mailbase.ac.uk or the WebBoard forum that can be accessed from the FOCUS\nWebsite.\nUsing FOCUS\nFOCUS is freely available via the Web (htttp:\/\/www.focus.acukf) for interested staff\ndevelopers and academics. Staff development materials and an evaluation questionnaire\nare available from the project's Website (follow the link from the database homepage);\n79\nJanice Smith FOCUS on technology-supported learning in further education\nfeedback and comments are welcome, especially from the FE sector. Evaluation of the\ndatabase will continue until December 2000, after which, if sufficient demand can be\ndemonstrated, FOCUS may be adopted as part of a core of generic resources to inform\ntechnology-supported learning developments within the tertiary sector.\nUsing FOCUS for staff development\n'Graduateness', 'employability' and participation in the 'information society' are\nimportant issues for the UK education system, and a central theme to each of these\nconcepts is 'ICT capability' (Boreham and Morgan, 1999). There is no single definition of\nICT capability, but if it is to go beyond mere word-processing skills, teaching staff in FE\nand HE will need a sound understanding of the pedagogic issues involved and how\ntechnology-supported learning will change their roles. FOCUS aims to do this by\nproviding a staff development resource that introduces teaching staff to the navigation and\nuse of the database. It is expected that individuals will follow up this introduction by\nfurther interrogation of the database content with regard to their particular interest.\nFollowing initial development, FOCUS was piloted within the HE community, and Table 1\n(below) shows responses from thirty-seven workshop participants. The evaluation of\nFOCUS's development found that for teaching staff, use of FOCUS is likely to mean\ninvestigating teaching techniques and case studies of innovations in practice. For technical\nand support staff, the features and capabilities of particular VLEs are more likely to be of\ninterest.\n% agreeing\nOption Teaching Non-teaching\nInformation required by the examples in the staff development materials\nInformation about teaching techniques of interest\nInformation about case studies of relevance\nInformation about software tools you might use\nTable I: How FOCUS was used\nFeedback was positive from these sessions, with participants making constructive\nsuggestions for amendment and inclusion, including a need to tailor activities to specific\naudiences. The navigational structure was found to be mostly helpful, and a majority of\nparticipants liked the breadth of content. When asked 'what was the most useful part of\nthe session for you?', over half said 'the URL'. Lecturing staff are increasingly being\nexpected to make use of technology-supported learning and, therefore, need to investigate\nresources such as FOCUS to become aware of the many possible tools to support their\nspecific circumstances. The most useful addition suggested by the HE audience was the\ninclusion of locally available resources and support. In response to this, the development\nteam is adding profiles of their expertise, but FOCUS must be seen as a generic resource,\nallowing individual institutions to make available information on supported tools and\nexpertise to allow technology-supported learning closely to match local needs.\n80\n39\n78\n61\n39\n38\n46\n31\n69\nALT-] Volume 8 Number 3\nAdapting FOCUS for an FE audience\nAs noted earlier, FOCUS was committed from the outset to involve FE as part of its\nintended user base. Therefore, in the latter stages of the project, dissemination was\nundertaken in the FE community to raise awareness and encourage FE contribution to the\nestablished HE content. Two pilot sessions were conducted, one for content comment and\none for staff development material design, in order to assess how well the database met the\nneeds of their group. Valuable feedback was gained regarding these issues, to improve the\nusefulness of the resource for an FE audience.\nAt the outset of the FE pilot sessions, FOCUS's HE origins were declared, along with the\nintention that the database aimed to reflect FE needs and incorporate relevant content.\nThe FE audience was invited to be a 'critical friend' to the project to suggest refinements\nand additions in order that FOCUS better reflected their needs and concerns. Each of the\ntopics identified during these sessions is discussed further below.\nDesign\nOverall, the interface was considered intuitive, if a little rigid. Anomalies in, for instance,\nthe interchangeable use of the terms 'teaching' and 'learning' were found to be irritating.\nThe integral Guide Me feature, where many FE participants started their investigation, was\ndeclared 'confusing' in terms of its inconsistent formatting. In terms of supported use, the\nGuide Me is a useful introduction. However, its visual similarity to the real database meant\nusers could not easily locate their position within the FOCUS framework. It was also felt\nthat the Guide Me feature did not fully explain the functionality of the database, such as its\nlocking mechanism, or the Copy-it! and Album features. Further discussion of this last\npoint revealed that people often saved useful Web pages, but found themselves, for\nwhatever reason, unable to open them in the future. An explicit explanation, that a\ncollection of articles can be emailed to a user for future reference, would enhance the Copy-\nit! and Album features, as would feedback that articles had been copied successfully.\nContent\nThe length of some of the articles was also found to be a barrier to greater FE take-up: 'it's\nvery accessible to HE people who are used to this kind of academic presentation. It needs to\nbe more \"tabloidy\" for FE.' Interestingly, this led to a suggestion that an additional button\ncould be included for FE users to click to access shorter, snappier articles, including 'a jazzy\nbox, sort of \"did you know\" reflecting conclusions from case studies, important points'. This\nremark supports a project team suggestion to include a 'tried that, didn't work' section.\nThe extremely limited time or support in FE for research means that lecturers need easily\naccessible information and support to address a 'problem', usually via subject-specific\nchannels. Many FE concerns are addressed within the text of the HE content, but these are\nfelt to be too lengthy. To increase accessibility for FE staff it may be useful to encourage\nFE content that conforms to something like the LTDI Evaluation Cookbook\n(http:llwww.icbl.hw.ac.uklltdif) - recipes that address the parameters of what a particular\ntechnology can achieve in terms of time, resources and scalability.\nRelevance\nAlongside the previously noted point about the length of some articles and their academic\npresentation, there was a concern to know that content was up to date: 'We need to know\n81\nJanice Smith FOCUS on technology-supported learning in further education\nthat it's frequently updated and can offer us something new.' This was followed by a\nsuggestion for a 'News' button that 'could highlight what's new in the last six months'. It is\nworth noting that a concern of the project team is tha,t content is accepted as current best\npractice, and an automated system of email alerts to authors has been instigated to ensure\nregular updates.\nFE participants also said they would appreciate brief introductions to the range of\nsoftware available. It was felt that the full reviews would certainly be useful to technical and\nsupport staff but that these are less of a concern to lecturing staff. This reinforces the point\nthat locally available information about supported tools is an important concern. The\ndatabase does offer a software 'feature checklist' but this is felt to be deeply embedded\nwithin a technical evaluation that does not appeal to teaching staff.\nThe most positive feedback from FE was reserved for the links from the database to other\nprojects and\/or Websites such as the Clyde Virtual University (http:llwww.cvu.ac.uk) and\nthe CAA Centre (http:llwww.caacentre.ac.uk). These were declared to be 'great fun - but we\nneed more of them'.\nIn the 'free' part of the staff development session, FE staff followed a similar pattern to that\nnoted amongst HE users - teaching staff investigated the teaching techniques whilst support\nstaff followed the 'Tools' link. Both categories of staff perused at least one case study, with\nthe only FE-provided article (LeTTOL, from Sheffield College) proving most popular.\nStaff development materials\nThe first of the two FE dissemination sessions was undertaken with a set of pilot materials\nin the form of a Powerpoint presentation. These materials were adapted from an initial\npilot of WebCT sessions within the project team.\nThis original set of materials was felt, within the FE sector, to be serving two purposes: an\nintroduction to the use of FOCUS and addressing strategic issues relating to the use of\n.Guide Me\n\u2022 Use the Guide Me feature to learn how\nto use FOCUS\n\u2022 Follow the step-by-step guided tour lo\nsee how you can use the pathfinder to\nlocate related information\nwww.focus.ac.uk Figure 2: The Guide Me tool.\n82\nALT-J Volume 8 Number 3\nFigure 3: The original learning\nobjectives.\nLearning objectives\n\u2022 After this session you should be able to:\n\u2022 define the purpose of FOCUS; ,\n\u2022 state the main objectives of FOCUS;\n\u2022 describe the features of FOCUS;\n\u2022 demonstrate how FOCUS can be used;\n\u2022 explain how FOCUS might be used to\ndevelop your teaching practice.\nwww.focus.ac.uk\nFigure 4: The applicability\nexerc\/se.\nApplicability\n\u2022 Identify the most appropriate tool(s) to\nsupport a teaching activity\n\u2022 You may like to consider:\n\u2022 Organisational issues\n\u2022 Technological issues\n\u2022 Startup costs- hardware, software, training\n\u2022 Staff and student training needs\n\u2022 Pedagogy- learning and teaching online\nwww.focus.ac.uk\nICT in learning and teaching. The guide to using FOCUS was felt to be incomplete (see\nFigure 2) as the major functional features of the database were not sufficiently explained.\nAlso, the learning outcomes were deemed inappropriate (Figure 3) as they appeared to\nenumerate project concerns over what the audience should consider when implementing\ntechnology-supported learning.\nIn addition, the 'Applicability' exercise (see Figure 4) was felt to be aimed at a different\naudience, specifically strategic management rather than teaching and support staff. Similar\nviews were expressed during HE dissemination.\nIn response to this feedback, the Powerpoint presentation was refined. Amongst project\nteam members, it was felt that a comprehensive introduction to FOCUS content and\nnavigation would be useful, and the slides reflected this concern. Figure 5 shows the\n83\nJanice Smith FOCUS on technology-supported learning in further education\nLearning outcomes\n. \u2022 After this session you should be able to:\n\u2022 describe the types of resources available\nin the FOCUS database\n\u2022 locate relevant resources using FOCUS\n\u2022 find related resources within FOCUS\n\u2022 copy resources for later reference\nwww.focus.ac.uk Figure 5: The redefined learning\noutcomes for the FE audience.\nFinding related resources\n\u2022 Suppose you're reading about CAA\n(Computer Assisted Assessment) and\nwant to look at relevant case studies:\n\u2022 Click on the red spot on the learning\nbutton to \"lock1 CAA:\nwww.focus.ac.uk\nFigure 6: Explaining the\nfeatures of FOCUS.\nredefined learning outcomes, and additional slides were created to introduce users to\nspecific database functions (Figures 6,7, 8 and 9).\nThe second FE session used the refined presentation, and this was felt to reflect more\nclosely what lecturing and support staff would want to know about accessing and\ninterrogating FOCUS, although the addition of a free search tool was considered\n'essential'. However, the FE staff developer was in favour of creating a further session\naddressing the strategic issues that had now been abandoned, a position supported by a\nmember of the project's steering group. Concerns in the FE sector mirror those found in\nHE: the lack of time and other resources - human and otherwise - to pursue technology-\nsupported learning. This issue will be addressed in the final development and evaluation\nphase of the project, and aims to draw upon existing expertise in the FE sector.\nALT-J Volume 8 Number 3\nFigure 7: Using the lock\nfeature.\nFinding related resources 2\n\u2022 Once CAA has been locked:\n\u2022 click on the idols button\n\u2022 click on the examples button to see a list\nof case studies that involve CAA\n\u2022 dick on an item to find out more about\nthese tools or examples\n\u2022 click again on tools or examples to re-\ndisplay the list of relevant items\nwww.focus.ac.uk\nFigure 8: Relating tools and\ntechniques.\nConclusions\nFinding related resources 3\n\u2022 You can also 'lbci< a tool to find;-\n\u2022 which educational techniques it supports\n\u2022 which case studies used it\n\u2022 Or lock an example to find:\n\u2022 which educational techniques it used\n\u2022 which tools it used\nwww.focus.ac.uk\nFOCUS has been greeted enthusiastically by an HE audience, with 94 per cent of survey\nrespondents saying they would continue to use the database. As many as 94 per cent also\nsaid they would recommend it to a colleague. A total of 83 per cent of teaching and 50 per\ncent of non-teaching staff stated that they had learnt something new about using\ncomputers to support learning and teaching. FOCUS is clearly a useful and valuable\nresource in the HE community. With greater awareness and contribution from the FE\nsector, it is hoped to replicate this kind of acceptance. Importantly, many of these\nconclusions will be equally relevant for other projects seeking to extend their scope to cover\nan FE audience. To date, the lessons learned include:\n\u2022 Be explicit about technical jargon\/terminology such as 'Copy it', 'Album' and 'Locking':\nthese are useful features that require full explanation if staff developers from outside\n85\nJanice Smith FOCUS on technology-supported learning in further education\nFinding related resources 4\n\u2022 Click on the green spot to unlock the\nitem when you have finished\nwww.focus.ac.uk\nFigure 9: Unlocking to explore\nother areas.\nthe project consortium are to ensure participants understand the full functionality of\nthe database.\n\u2022 Provide summaries of content: whilst HE staff are familiar with the academic\npresentation of information, the FE staff consulted preferred summaries of content,\nsuch as the suggestion of a shorter 'hints and tips' section. Time pressures mean that in\norder to adopt technology-supported learning, FE staff need to know which tools and\ntechniques will best support their particular needs.\n\u2022 Highlight what's new: of importance to both FE and HE staff is knowing that this\ninformation is up-to-date and reflects current good practice.\n\u2022 Distinctive audiences: it may be necessary to separate groups of users according to their\ninterests and remit, such as strategic management and teaching\/support staff. Costs\nand benefits need to be taken account of at senior management level, whilst complexity\nand 'fit' to purpose for lecturing staff and support requirements for learning\nsupport\/technical staff are important issues. FOCUS as a one-stop shop offers\ninvaluable information to each group, but targeted training is required for each distinct\ngroup, an issue common to both FE and HE audiences.\nFE activities will continue in the final evaluation phase of the project in order to ensure its\nwide acceptance and appropriateness for this sector.\nIn summary, many of HE's concerns about incorporating technology-supported learning\ninto the curriculum are reflected in the FE sector, and will assume greater importance as\nthe proportion of HE delivered in the FE sector continues to grow. Greater specialization\nof roles and lowering units of resource have accentuated these issues still further.\nInvestment in technology-supported learning in HE is now key to many institutional\nlearning and teaching strategies. It is useful to explore how far knowledge about, and\nsupport for, such innovations can be extended to an expanding FE sector.\n86\nALT-] Volume 8 Number 3\nAcknowledgements\nMy thanks to Dr Martin Oliver for his comments on a first draft of this paper, Lucy Moy-\nThomas and colleagues at Barking College for their comments, and to the FOCUS project\nteam for their design and development work.\nReferences\nBailey, P.
