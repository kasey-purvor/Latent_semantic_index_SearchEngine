Recently much effort has been invested in computing\nNNLO QCD corrections to a wide variety of partonic processes [1] and therefore we need to\ngenerate parton distributions also at NNLO so that the theory can be applied in a consistent\nmanner. Analyzing DIS at NNLO is important in itself in that we may be able to investigate\nthe hierarchy LO \u2192 NLO \u2192 NNLO in the process where there are perhaps the most precise\ndata. Recently, there has been a significant increase in the precision of the structure function\ndata from the HERA experiments [2]\u2013[6] and these, together with the inclusive jet production\nmeasurements at the Tevatron [7, 8], were used to generate an updated version of the NLO\npartons [9].1\nTo carry out the analogous analysis at NNLO we need both the relevant splitting functions\nas well as the coefficient functions. However, although the deep inelastic coefficient functions\nare known at NNLO [11], the splitting functions are not yet available at this order. On the\nother hand, valuable partial information is known in the form of the few lowest moments of the\nsplitting functions [12], which tightly constrain the large x behaviour. When this is combined\nwith the known most singular log 1\/x behaviour [13], it greatly limits the possible behaviour of\nthe functions down to quite small values of x. Indeed, van Neerven and Vogt [14] constructed\na range of compact analytic expressions for the splitting functions that are all compatible with\nthis information. In particular, they provided closed expressions which represent the fastest\nand the slowest permissible evolution. In an exploratory NNLO global analysis of the data [15],\nwe, in turn, used these expressions to obtain bands representing the spread of allowed parton\ndistributions. For example, the range of uncertainty of the NNLO gluon distribution was found\nto be about \u00b130% (\u00b115%) at x \u223c 10\u22124(10\u22123).\nSubsequently, the moment calculation of the three-loop splitting functions was extended to\ngive two higher moments [16]. This has allowed van Neerven and Vogt [17] to provide analytic\nexpressions for the NNLO splitting functions which considerably increase the reliability of the\nevolution in the region x >\u223c 10\n\u22123. In other words, the allowed bands of permissible splitting\nfunctions has shrunk considerably, even, somewhat surprisingly, at small x.2 The splitting\nfunctions are located near the \u2018slow evolution\u2019 edge of their previous bands.\nHere, we use these improved constraints on the splitting functions to perform a new NNLO\nglobal parton analysis of the available data sets, which include the new more precise structure\nfunction measurements from HERA [2]\u2013[6] and the inclusive jet data from the Tevatron [7, 8].\nThe analysis uses the same form of the starting parameterizations and the same data sets\n[2]\u2013[8], [18]\u2013[28], with the same Q2 and W 2 cuts, as our recent NLO global analysis [9]. In\n1As in [9], we use the D0 data obtained using the cone algorithm rather than those obtained [10] using the\nkT algorithm, since the former have greater rapidity coverage and have been studied more extensively.\n2The allowed band contains the vast majority of permissible behaviours, but it is still possible to find perfectly\nacceptable forms which lie considerably outside this region, particularly at very small x; i.e. the bands should\nnot be regarded as anything like one-sigma errors in a Gaussian distribution.\n1\nparticular, we fit to DIS data with Q2 > 2 GeV2 and W 2 > 12.5 GeV2.3 In going to a NNLO\nanalysis, we use the three-loop expression for \u03b1S, in the MS scheme, and we extend the matching\nconditions when evolving through the heavy quark thresholds. The details of the heavy quark\nprescription are very similar to those in [15], but we add a brief discussion of important points in\nthe Appendix. Although the deep inelastic data are described at NNLO, some other processes\nare not yet calculated to this accuracy, and so we have to use NLO expressions to fit to the\ndata for (i) Tevatron jet production, (ii) the charged lepton rapidity asymmetry from W boson\nhadroproduction and (iii) the Drell-Yan process4. We note that the effect of the threshold\ncorrections at NNLO to Tevatron jet production has been calculated in [30], and this reduces\nscale uncertainty and perhaps is a good approximation to the full NNLO correction. The result\nis approximately a 3 \u2212 4% increase in normalization of the theory prediction (not surprising\nsince the NLO correction is itself about a 7 \u2212 10% raise, largely independent of ET ), which\nwould be completely subsumed in the normalization error of the data.\nThe optimum global NNLO fit is obtained with the starting parameterizations of the partons\nat Q20 = 1 GeV\n2 given by\nxuV = 0.262x\n0.31(1\u2212 x)3.50(1 + 3.83x0.5 + 37.65x) (1)\nxdV = 0.061x\n0.35(1\u2212 x)4.03(1 + 49.05x0.5 + 8.65x) (2)\nxS = 0.759x\u22120.12(1\u2212 x)7.66(1\u2212 1.34x0.5 + 7.40x) (3)\nxg = 0.669x0.00(1\u2212 x)3.96(1 + 6.98x0.5 \u2212 3.63x)\u2212 0.23x\u22120.27(1\u2212 x)8.7. (4)\nThe flavour structure of the light quark sea is taken to be\n2u\u00af, 2d\u00af, 2s\u00af = 0.4S \u2212\u2206, 0.4S +\u2206, 0.2S (5)\nwith s = s\u00af, as implied by the NuTeV data [19], and where\nx\u2206 = x(d\u00af\u2212 u\u00af) = 1.432x1.24(1\u2212 x)9.66(1 + 9.86x\u2212 29.04x2). (6)\nThe masses of the quarks are taken to be mc = 1.43 GeV and mb = 4.3 GeV, the former\ngiving the best fit to the charm structure function data. The value of \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) = 0.1155, and\nis displayed in Table 1. This fit corresponds to the average of two extreme choices for the sets\nof splitting functions in Ref. [17] and we can explore the uncertainty of the NNLO evolution\nby instead choosing either extreme. These \u2018slow\u2019 and \u2018fast\u2019 evolutions we denote by A and B\nrespectively.\nFor the sake of studying the progression from LO through NLO to NNLO, we also perform\na pure LO fit, for which the starting parameterization is\nxuV = 0.474x\n0.30(1\u2212 x)3.12(1\u2212 1.32x0.5 + 19.56x) (7)\n3As for the NLO fit, we have investigated the consequences of changing these cuts, and introducing cuts at\nsmall x. The results are similar to NLO, and will be reported in [29].\n4For Drell-Yan scattering the inclusive rate is known at NNLO, but not the differential distribution in xF\nthat we use in the analysis.\n2\nxdV = 0.668x\n0.43(1\u2212 x)4.03(1\u2212 0.83x0.5 + 7.68x) (8)\nxS = 0.458x\u22120.19(1\u2212 x)7.51(1 + 0.025x0.5 + 7.63x) (9)\nxg = 3.08x0.10(1\u2212 x)6.49(1\u2212 2.96x0.5 + 9.26x) (10)\nwith\nx\u2206 = x(d\u00af\u2212 u\u00af) = 4.163x1.76(1\u2212 x)9.51(1 + 7.20x\u2212 24.8x2). (11)\nIn this case \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) = 0.130 (again see Table 1), and the parameterization of the gluon is\nsimpler because the fit no longer requires a negative input gluon at small x at this order.\nTable 1: The QCD coupling, and corresponding \u039b parameter for nf = 4 (in the MS scheme\nwith \u00b52 = Q2 in all cases), for the LO, NLO and NNLO fits. Note that as we progress from\norder to order a very different value of \u039bQCD is needed to give the same \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ), that is \u03b1S(Q\n2)\nis defined differently at different orders.\n\u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) \u039bQCD (MeV)\nLO 0.130 220\nNLO 0.119 323\nNNLO 0.1155 235\nThe quality of the NNLO fit to the major data sets is shown in Table 2, together with that\nof the NLO [9] and LO analyses. For each of the smaller data sets, e.g. the CDFW\u2212asymmetry\n[27] and E866 Drell-Yan asymmetry [20], the \u03c72 per degree of freedom is about 1 per point.\nFor all the DIS data sets the numbers are quoted for statistical and systematic errors added\nin quadrature.5 The quality of the fits to the individual data sets is satisfactory. For the\nE605 data the systematic errors are quoted in a slightly ambiguous manner, and are generally\nsubdominant, and so we fit to statistical errors alone. Hence the quite large \u03c72 in this case.\nOur treatment of the correlated systematic errors for the Tevatron jet data has been discussed\nin Ref. [9]. In Fig. 1 we also show the LO, NLO and NNLO descriptions of the F2 data in a\nfew representative x bins.\nFor the fit to the DIS data the story is relatively straightforward. In general, as we proceed\nfrom the LO\u2192NLO\u2192NNLO analysis, there is a sequential improvement in the quality of the\nfit (with a couple of dissenting data sets), with the incremental improvement being smaller at\nthe second stage. The LO fit fails because the evolution is a little too slow at small x and also\ntoo slow, and not quite the correct shape, at large x. This is because there are higher-order\nbut small-x-enhanced terms missing in the quark-gluon splitting function and higher-order\nbut large-x-enhanced terms missing in the coefficient functions. This can not be completely\ncountered even with a very large value of the coupling constant and a large small x gluon.\n5A discussion of the influence of the correlated systematic errors for the HERA data may be found in the\nAppendix of [9].\n3\nTable 2: Quality of the NNLO fits to different data sets, together with the corresponding \u03c72\nvalues for the NLO and LO fits to the same data.\nData set No. of LO NLO NNLO NNLOJ\ndata pts\nH1 ep 400 493 382 385 381\nZEUS ep 272 296 254 264 275\nBCDMS \u00b5p 179 179 193 173 175\nBCDMS \u00b5d 155 206 218 231 226\nNMC \u00b5p 126 131 134 121 120\nNMC \u00b5d 126 98 100 88 86\nSLAC ep 53 83 66 59 65\nSLAC ed 54 98 56 59 61\nE665 \u00b5p 53 50 51 55 59\nE665 \u00b5d 53 62 61 62 64\nCCFR F \u03bdN2 74 116 85 80 78\nCCFR F \u03bdN3 105 126 107 110 126\nNMC n\/p 156 157 155 150 148\nE605 DY 136 282 232 220 268\nTevatron Jets 113 123 170 186 124\nTotal 2097 2500 2328 2323 2341\nThe improvement in the NNLO fit is due to the inclusion of these small and large x terms at\nNNLO, and this also allows a smaller coupling constant than for the NLO fit. However, the\nimprovement in the quality of the fit to DIS data is not as dramatic as that seen in Ref. [15].\nThis is partially due to our raised W 2 cut \u2013 NNLO working a little better in the now excluded\n10 GeV2 < W 2 < 12.5 GeV2 range. However, the improvement at small x is not as great,\nand this seems to be due to the fact that the fit actually preferred the previous estimate of\nthe NNLO splitting functions which had quicker small x evolution. This may be a sign that\nyet higher orders are important in this regime. For the Drell-Yan data the pattern is the same\nas for DIS data, the improvement at each successive order being correlated largely with the\nreduction in the coupling constant, since as we discovered in [9] the Drell-Yan data prefer a\nlower value of \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ).\nThe situation for the Tevatron high-ET jet data is rather different and very interesting. As\nwe see from Table 2 there is actually a distinct deterioration in the quality of fit to the jet\ndata as we go to higher orders, and at LO we obtain almost as good a fit as seems possible\ngiven the scatter of points. This is a very surprising result (we are not aware it has been\nnoticed previously), but actually quite easy to understand. The way in which the different\nparton scattering combinations usually contribute to the jet rate is shown in Fig. 2 of [31].\nAt the high ET end of the jet measurements the rate is mainly determined by quarks and is\n4\ngiven roughly by \u03b12S(qq + qq\u00af). In a standard fit this contribution is usually determined very\naccurately and the normal excess in data must be accounted for by an increase in the g(q + q\u00af)\ncontribution, i.e. in the high x gluon. Hence the better description obtained in the special\nCTEQHJ [32] and MRST2001J [9] sets. However, at high x the quark coefficient functions are\nenhanced at large x at higher orders, behaving roughly like \u03b1S(ln(1\u2212x)\/(1\u2212x))+ at NLO, and\nlike \u03b12S((ln(1\u2212 x))\n3)\/(1\u2212 x))+ at NNLO. These positive contributions lead to a smaller quark\ndistribution at high x, as one goes to higher order, in order to fit the DIS data. Also, as we\nhave seen, the coupling required by the best fit decreases with increasing order. The net effect\nis that \u03b12S(qq+ qq\u00af) at high x is much (up to 40%) larger at LO than at NLO. At x \u223c 0.1, which\nis relevant for the lower ET end of the jet data, where the rate is dominated by the g(q+ q\u00af) and\ngg contributions, the gluons are a little smaller at LO due to the need to have more gluons at\nvery small x, and this compensates for the increased \u03b1S. Overall, this results in the shape of\nthe parton distributions at LO being very suitable for the description of the Tevatron jet data\nwithout any strong constraints (the gluon at LO is naturally not too small at high x). The\ncomparison of the LO and NLO descriptions of the CDF jet data is shown in Fig. 2, and as\none can see the shape and normalization of the LO theory prediction compares very well to the\ndata without recourse to the large shifts in data from correlated systematic errors. As shown\nin Table 2, this translates into a huge reduction in \u03c72. We find this result of a very good match\nat LO, and a big change in going to NLO, very intriguing. This observation may possibly be\nrelevant for analyses which extract the jet rates using LO Monte Carlos with LO partons.6\nConversely at NNLO the quarks are slightly smaller at high x than at NLO and this means\nthat there must be slightly more gluon needed at high x for a good fit to the jet data. Within\nthe context of the global fit this means that at NNLO the fit to Tevatron jet data is slightly\nworse and there is an even stronger constraint on the high x gluon than at NLO.7 This increase\nin the \u03c72 for the jet data at NNLO means that the overall improvement in the quality of the\nglobal fit compared to NLO is only marginal.\nAs in our NLO analysis [9], we have investigated the sensitivity to \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ). The results\nare similar, with an approximate error of 0.002 again being attributable due to the quality of\nthe fit. The \u03c72 profile is similar to that for the global fit in Fig. 16 of [9], except that the\nminimum is now at \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) = 0.1155 and the increase in \u03c7\n2 is slightly steeper for increasing\n\u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) rather than decreasing \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ). Indeed the profiles are rather similar to those in [9]\nfor each data set. As in [9], where more details of the procedure can be found, we have also\nobtained a special set of partons (denoted NNLOJ) by forcing a very good fit to the jet data.\nThe quality of this fit is shown in Table 2. As at NLO the coupling is required to rise to obtain\nthe best (NNLOJ) fit, but in this case only to \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) = 0.118. The shape of the NNLOJ\n6We have checked that the good jet fit is a feature of LO partons in general, not just this particular set.\n7In [15] we did not incorporate independent fits to the jet data at each order, i.e. the same high x gluon\nconstraint was used for the NNLO as for the NLO analysis and that at LO was different only by a constant\nK-factor. This is responsible in part for some of the differences between the results in [15] and this paper, e.g.\nthe higher value of \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ\n) used at LO and perhaps the smaller improvement in the quality of the fit at NNLO\ncompared to NLO.\n5\nhigh-x gluon is very similar to that at NLO, seen in Fig. 15 of [9], and the way in which the\nglobal fit is affected is similar to NLO, i.e. the main casualty of the improved jet fit is the\nDrell-Yan comparison.\nWe now consider the impact on the parton distributions. In Fig. 3 we show the gluon\ndistributions for each of the analyses at several values of Q2. At the starting scale of Q2 =\n1 GeV2, both NLO and NNLO gluons are negative for very low x with the NLO lying below\nthe NNLO. As Q2 increases, the NNLO gluon evolves relatively more slowly so that by Q2 =\n5 GeV2 the situation is reversed, both gluons being positive with the NLO gluon now above\nthe NNLO one. Also shown are the NNLO gluons from the fits using the extreme allowed\nforms of the splitting functions. We note that the spread between these gluons is somewhat\nreduced, particularly above x = 10\u22123, compared to the range obtained in Ref. [15] as a result\nof the improved reliability of the NNLO splitting functions of Ref. [17]. We also note that the\nNNLO gluon is generally closer to the NLO gluon at very low x compared to the case in [15].\nThis is due to the decrease of the NNLO quark-gluon splitting function at low x compared to\nthe previous expectation, therefore allowing more small x gluon at NNLO. As in Ref. [15] the\nnegative feature of the gluon at low x and low Q2 is not, in itself, a matter for concern since it\nis not a physical observable, being a scheme dependent quantity.\nIn Fig. 4 we compare the parton distributions found in the NNLO fit to those obtained in\nthe NLO analysis [9]. We plot the NNLO\/NLO ratios for the gluon, and the up and down\nquark distributions, at Q2 = 10 and 104 GeV2. In going from the NLO to the NNLO analysis,\nseveral features of Fig. 4 are worth noting. The decrease of the quark distribution at high x\nand the increase at low x (at the lower Q2 value) reflect the behaviour of the NNLO quark\nand gluon coefficient functions respectively. We have already seen above that for Q2 > 5 GeV2\nthe NLO gluon has overtaken the NNLO gluon and this situation remains as the evolution\ncontinues. The rise at large x for the NNLO\/NLO gluon ratio is a consequence of the need for\nmore gluon at high x to fit the Tevatron jet data and also of momentum conservation \u2013 the\npositive NNLO quark-gluon splitting function at low x means less gluon is required here and\nmore is available elsewhere. This enhancement of the gluon for x above about 0.1 leads to a\nparticularly improved fit to the NMC DIS data at NNLO. With the evolution to high Q2, the\nNNLO effects play less of a role, and the NNLO coefficient functions have very little impact.\nHowever, the relatively smaller low-x NNLO gluon introduced at low Q2 produces a slower\nevolution of all partons at low x, which can be seen at Q2 = 104 GeV2.\nComputing NNLO predictions for the longitudinal structure function FL requires a knowl-\nedge of the O(\u03b13S) coefficient functions. In Ref. [15] we used the partial information of the first\nfour even moments together with the x \u2192 0 behaviour to estimate analogous expressions to\nthe O(\u03b13S) splitting functions of Ref. [17]. Here we continue with that approach to compare the\nNNLO prediction for FL with the NLO one. In fact the two additional moments lead to the\nmost likely coefficient functions being essentially unchanged from those used in [15] (a lucky\naccident), but we note that the band of uncertainty on these coefficient functions is much larger\nthan on the splitting functions. Truly predictive results await a more complete analysis. In our\n6\nrecent NLO analysis [9] we drew attention to the unphysical behaviour of the NLO prediction\nfor FL at low Q\n2 and very low x, shown in Fig. 5, suggesting that the negative feature may\nbe a hint that NLO cannot provide the entire description in that region. Now we see that\nthe NNLO prediction is indeed more satisfactory, with the physical observable FL remaining\npositive at Q2 = 2 GeV2 down to x = 10\u22125. Even this qualitative conclusion is not definite\nwith the present level of uncertainty. More reliable is the fact that the NNLO prediction is\nbelow that at NLO at high Q2, since this relies less on the coefficient function and more on the\ngluon evolution.\nThe improvement in the description of F2 going from NLO to NNLO is not as dramatic as\nthat going from LO to NLO. This could be interpreted as evidence for some convergence as we\ngo to higher orders. One phenomenological question that has been raised is whether the data\nwhich lie below our cut of W 2 = 12.5 GeV2, which is imposed to remove possible higher twist\ncontamination, could be consistently described by NNLO effects. At large x the data below this\ncut show a marked rise above the NLO description \u2013 as much as 40\u221250% at low Q2 \u2013 suggesting\na sizeable higher twist contribution. Fig. 6 shows that the differences between NNLO and NLO\nat large x are indeed significant, and are always in the correct direction. However, they are not\nat the level needed to account for the magnitude of the observed discrepancies.\nWe have also investigated the predictions for the W and Z production cross sections at the\nTevatron and the LHC, and compared them with those obtained previously in Ref. [15]. For\npurposes of comparison we have kept all electroweak parameters, branching ratios etc. at the\nsame values as in [33, 15]. The results are shown in Table 3. As one can see the difference\nbetween the 2001 and 2000 predictions is always of the order of 0.5% or less, showing that\nneither the new data in the fit nor the changes in the NNLO splitting functions have led to\nany significant changes.8 However, the error band on the prediction due to the uncertainty on\nthe splitting functions has been significantly reduced due to the better estimate of the NNLO\nsplitting functions. At Tevatron energies the difference between the \u2018slow\u2019 and \u2018fast\u2019 NNLO\nevolution predictions is at the per mille level, while at the LHC the difference is still less than\n1%.\nIn summary, we have have carried out NNLO and LO global analyses of data which include\nthe most recent data on DIS from HERA together with constraints from hard scattering data.\nComparisons were made with our recent NLO analysis [9] for the the structure functions and\nfor the partons themselves. There is improvement in the general quality of the description of\nthe data as one goes to higher orders, though the improvement in the global fit at NNLO is\nnot as great as one might expect, and there is also the surprising result that the LO partons\ngive an excellent fit to the Tevatron high-ET jet data. The partons at NNLO change by up to\n15% for Q2 \u2265 10 GeV2 compared to those at NLO, with the largest change being in the gluon,\nwhich decreases for x less than about 0.05 but increases for x > 0.1. The quarks increase for\nx < 0.01 at low Q2 due to the negative gluon coefficient function, but decrease at lower x for\n8The predictions in [9] were made using the \u2018hybrid\u2019 method of combining NLO partons with the known\nNNLO coefficient functions.\n7\nTable 3: Predictions in nb for W and Z production cross sections at the Tevatron and LHC,\ncompared with those of MRST2000 [15].\nMRST2000 MRST2001\nNLO\nTevatron B\u2113\u03bd \u00b7 \u03c3W 2.39 2.41\nB\u2113+\u2113\u2212 \u00b7 \u03c3Z 0.219 0.220\nLHC B\u2113\u03bd \u00b7 \u03c3W 20.5 20.6\nB\u2113+\u2113\u2212 \u00b7 \u03c3Z 1.88 1.89\nNNLO\nTevatron B\u2113\u03bd \u00b7 \u03c3W 2.51 2.50\nB\u2113+\u2113\u2212 \u00b7 \u03c3Z 0.230 0.230\nLHC B\u2113\u03bd \u00b7 \u03c3W 19.9 20.0\nB\u2113+\u2113\u2212 \u00b7 \u03c3Z 1.84 1.85\nhigher Q2 because of the slower evolution due to the smaller gluon. They also decrease at very\nhigh x due to the positive effect of the NNLO coefficient function.\nWe note that these are the first generally available sets of partons at NNLO and should add\nimpetus to the large activity presently under way to compute NNLO corrections to a variety of\nhard processes. In particular, the computation of the \u2018missing\u2019 NNLO coefficient functions for\nthe differential Drell-Yan and large-ET jet cross sections used in the global fit to constrain the\nlarge-x sea and gluon distributions respectively is now a matter of some urgency. The NNLO\npartons discussed ini this paper can be found at http:\/\/durpdg.dur.ac.uk\/hepdata\/mrs\ntogether with the recent NLO partons (MS scheme) from a similar analysis [9]. For completeness\nwe have also added the NLO partons for MRST2001 in the DIS scheme and the LO partons\ndiscussed in this paper.\n1 Acknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Andreas Vogt, for useful discussions regarding NNLO splitting functions.\nRST would like to thank the Royal Society for the award of a University Research Fellowship.\nThis work was supported in part by the EU Fourth Framework Programme \u201cTraining and\nMobility of Researchers\u201d, Network \u201cQuantum Chromodynamics and the Deep Structure of\nElementary Particles\u201d, contract FMRX-CT98-0194(DG 12 - MIHT).\nAppendix\nWe use a very similar charm prescription to that adopted in [15], which is a generalization of\nthe Thorne-Roberts variable-flavour-number scheme (VFNS) [34] to NNLO. As explained in\n8\n[15], this has to be a model, since the NNLO fixed-flavour-number scheme (FFNS) coefficients\nare not known. In principle we should be more sophisticated and (i) use a correct matching\nprocedure for the NNLO VFNS coefficient function (possible at present), (ii) take into account\nthe small discontinuity of the charm parton distribution at NNLO (also possible at present),\nand (iii) also take in account the effect of the NNLO FFNS coefficient function (not possible at\npresent). Since the full NNLO prescription is missing, and since the NNLO splitting functions\nare approximate themselves at present, we adopt a simple procedure at NNLO. In [15] we\njust used the massless O(\u03b12S) gluon coefficient function multiplied by the velocity of the heavy\nquark \u03b2 = (1 \u2212 4m2Hz\/(Q\n2(1 \u2212 z))0.5, which has the correct threshold behaviour but \u2192 1 at\nhigh Q2, as the NNLO coefficient function at all Q2. Here mH is the mass of the heavy quark.\nThis has the shortcoming that it leads to a (small) negative contribution at low Q2 and small\nx since the the massless O(\u03b12S) gluon coefficient function is negative at small x, whereas we\nwould expect the NNLO FFNS contribution to actually be positive in this region. Indeed the\nlow x, low Q2 charm data are underestimated using our procedure. Hence in this paper we\nadopt the minimal simple modification and weight by \u03b22 rather than \u03b2, so that this negative\ncontribution is minimized. This improves both the fit to charm data and the global fit. This\nsimple approach seems to us to be sufficient at the present level of theoretical accuracy. Once\nthe splitting functions are known exactly at NNLO we should improve our NNLO charm model.\nIn principle one can even produce an approximate NNLO FFNS coefficient function from the\nknown small x limit [35] and known threshold logarithms [36].\n9\nReferences\n[1] C.
